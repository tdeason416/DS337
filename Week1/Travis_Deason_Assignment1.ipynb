    "-\tBased on the data collected in this assignment, Vocabulary size seems to be a better measure of reading level then lexical diversity, but even with this measure, there is still an example that diverges from the trend.  Perhaps the best method of measuring text reading difficulty would not be to measure the overall word count or lexical diversity, but to measure the frequency of word appearance in relation to how often the words appear in all English language.  It also seems probable that it is not easy to measure reading difficulty by measuring a single variable.  It would have to be placed within a larger context.  For example, if one book has a very large vocabulary of commonly used words; while another book contains more ecelectic language, but contains overall less vocabulary, the later book would likely be the more difficult one to read."
