 The hook
 the depth
 a great emotional undercurrent
 people
 a way other music genres
 People who
 pop music
 disposable
 haven ’ t
 good pop music
 One
 the best qualities
 Max Minghella ’
 directorial debut “ Teen Spirit ”

 the transformative power
 a great pop song
 uses music

 The biggest problem
 “ Teen Spirit ”
 the stakes
 There

 We

 Violet
 concerned
 her fate
 I
 Elle Fanning a great deal
 she

 anything wrong
 more depth

 It
 the kind
 which the word ‘ generic ’

 It

 the social commentary
 “ Vox Lux ”

 almost nothing
