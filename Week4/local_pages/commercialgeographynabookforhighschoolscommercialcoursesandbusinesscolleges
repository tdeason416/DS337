Redway\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quiet industrial struggle through which the United States passed\r\nduring the last decade of the nineteenth century cannot fail to impress\r\nthe student of political economy with the fact that commercial\r\nrevolution is a normal result of industrial evolution. Within a period\r\nof twenty-five years the transportation of commodities has grown to be\r\nnot only a science, but a power in the betterment of civil and political\r\nlife as well; and the world, which in the time of M. Jules Verne was\r\neighty days wide, is now scarcely forty.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the Bessemer process for making steel was intended\r\nprimarily to give the railway-operator a track that should be free from\r\nthe defects of the soft, wrought-iron rail; in fact, however, it created\r\nnew industrial centres all over the world and brought Asia and Africa\r\nunder commercial conquest. The possibilities of increased trade between\r\nthe Atlantic seaboard and the Pacific Coast States led to the building\r\nof the Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railways. But when these were\r\nthoroughly organized, there unexpectedly resulted a new trade-route that\r\nalready is drawing traffic away from the Suez Canal and landing it at\r\nAsian shores by way of the ports of Puget Sound. It is a repetition of\r\nthe adjustment that occurred when the opening of the Cape route to India\r\ntransferred the trade that had gathered about Venice and Genoa to the\r\nshores of the North and Baltic Seas.\r\n\r\nIn other words, a new order of things has come about, and the world and\r\nthe people therein are readjusting themselves to the requirements made\r\nupon them by commerce. And so at the beginning of a new century,\r\ncivilized man is drawing upon all the rest of the world to satisfy his\r\nwants, and giving to all the world in return; he is civilized because of\r\nthis interchange and not in spite of it.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for instruction in a subject that pertains so closely to\r\nthe welfare of a people is apparent, and an apology for presenting this\r\nmanual is needless. Moreover, it should not interfere in any way with\r\nthe regular course in geography; indeed, more comprehensive work in the\r\nlatter is becoming imperative, and it should be enriched rather than\r\ncurtailed.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of the work, I wish to express my appreciation of the\r\ngreat assistance of Principal Myron T. Pritchard, Edward Everett School,\r\nBoston, Mass. I am also much indebted to the map-engraving department of\r\nMessrs.

Under no circumstances, however, should Chapters V, VI,\r\nVIII, IX, XII, and XIII be omitted. A casual inspection of the questions\r\nat the end of each chapter will serve to show that they cannot be\r\nanswered from the pages of the book, and they have been selected with\r\nthis idea in view. They are intended first of all to stimulate\r\nindividual thought, and secondly to encourage the pupil to investigate\r\nthe topics by consulting original sources. The practice of corresponding\r\nwith pupils in other parts of the world cannot be too highly commended.\r\n\r\nThe following list represents a minimum rather than a maximum reference\r\nlibrary. It may be enlarged at the judgment of the teacher. A good atlas\r\nand a cyclop\xc3\xa6dia are also necessary.\r\n\r\n     Industrial Evolution of the United States. WRIGHT.

Peoples who receive nothing from their\r\nfellow-men, and who give nothing in return, are usually but little above\r\na savage state. Civilized man draws upon all the rest of the world for\r\nwhat he requires, and gives to the rest of the world in return. He is\r\ncivilized because of this fact and not in spite of it.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a country in the world that does not yield something\r\nor other to civilized peoples. There is scarcely a household whose\r\nfurnishings and contents do not represent an aggregate journey of\r\nseveral times around the earth. A family in New York at breakfast occupy\r\nchairs from Grand Rapids, Mich.; they partake of bread made of wheat\r\nfrom Minnesota, and meat from Texas prepared in a range made in St.\r\nLouis; coffee grown in Sumatra or Java, or tea from China is served in\r\ncups made in Japan, sweetened with sugar from Cuba, stirred with spoons\r\nof silver from Nevada. Spices from Africa, South America, and Asia\r\nseason the food, which is served on a table of New Hampshire oak,\r\ncovered with a linen spread made from flax grown in Ireland or in\r\nRussia. Rugs from Bokhara, or from Baluchistan, cover the floors;\r\nporti\xc3\xa8res made in Constantinople hang at the doors; and the room is\r\nheated with coal from Pennsylvania that burns in a furnace made in Rhode\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nNow all these things may be, and usually are, found in the great\r\nmajority of families in the United States or Europe, and most of them\r\nwill be found in nearly all households. Certain it is that peoples do\r\nexist who, from the immediate vicinity in which they live, procure all\r\nthe things they use or consume. In the main, however, such peoples are\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nA moment\'s thought will make it clear that before an ordinary meal can\r\nbe served there must be railways, steamships, great manufacturing\r\nestablishments, iron quarries, and coal mines, aggregating many thousand\r\nmillions of dollars, and employing many million people. A casual\r\ninspection, too, reveals the fact that all of the substances and things\r\nrequired by mankind come from the earth, and, a very few excepted, every\r\none requires a certain amount of manufacture or preliminary treatment\r\nbefore it is usable. The grains and nearly all the other food-stuffs\r\nrequire various processes of preparation before they are ready for\r\nconsumption by civilized peoples. Iron and the various other ores used\r\nin the arts must undergo elaborate processes of manufacture; coal must\r\nbe mined, broken, cleaned, and transported; the soil in which\r\nfood-stuffs are grown must be fertilized and mechanically prepared; and\r\neven the water required for domestic purposes in many instances must be\r\ntransported long distances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURE SUPPLEMENT EACH OTHER]\r\n\r\nA little thought will suffice to show that not only are all food-stuffs\r\nderived from the earth, but that also every usable resource which\r\nconstitutes wealth is also drawn from the same source. The same is also\r\npretty nearly true of the various forms of energy, for although the sun\r\nis the real source of light and heat, and probably of electricity, these\r\nagents are usable only when they have been transformed into earth\r\nenergies. Thus, the physical energy generated by falling water is merely\r\na transformed portion of solar heat; so also the coal-beds contain both\r\nthe chemical and physical energy of solar heat and light converted into\r\npotential energy--that is, into force that can be used at the will of\r\nintelligence. Indeed, the physical being of mankind is an organism born\r\nof the earth, and adapted to the earth; and when that physical form\r\ndies, it merely is transformed again to ordinary earth substances.\r\n\r\nThe chief activities of living beings are those relating to the\r\nmaintenance of life. In other words, animals must feed, and they must\r\nalso protect themselves against extermination. In the case of all other\r\nanimals this is a very simple matter, they simply live in immediate\r\ncontact with their food, migrating or perishing if the supply gives out.\r\nIn the case of mankind the conditions are different and vastly more\r\nelaborate. Savage peoples excepted, man does not live within close touch\r\nof the things he requires; indeed, he cannot, for he depends upon all\r\nthe world for what he uses. In a less enlightened state many of these\r\ncommodities were luxuries; in a civilized state they have become\r\nnecessities. Moreover, nearly everything civilized man employs has been\r\nprepared by processes in which heat is employed.\r\n\r\nTherefore one may specify several classes of human activities and\r\nemployments:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) The production of food-stuffs and other commodities by the\r\n     cultivation of the soil--_Agriculture_.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) The preparation of food-stuffs and things used for shelter,\r\n     protection, or ornament--_Manufacture_.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) The production of minerals for the generation of power, such\r\n     as coal, or those such as iron, copper, stone, etc., required in\r\n     the arts and sciences--_Mining_.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) The exchange of food stuffs and commodities--_Commerce_.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) The transfer of commodities--_Transportation_.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the prosperity and happiness of a people depend very\r\nlargely on the condition of their surroundings--that is, their\r\nenvironment. If a country or an inhabited area produces all the\r\nfood-stuffs and commodities required by its people, the conditions are\r\nvery fortunate. A very few nations, notably China and the United States,\r\nhave such diverse conditions of climate, topography, and mineral\r\nresources, that they can, if necessary, produce within their national\r\nborders everything needed by their peoples.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of such a policy, however, is rarely economical; in the\r\nhistory of the past it has always resulted in weakness and\r\ndisintegration. China is to-day helpless because of a policy of\r\nself-seclusion; and the marvellous growth of Japan began when her trade\r\nwas thrown open to the world.\r\n\r\nFor the greater part the environment of a people is deficient--that is,\r\nthe locality of a people does not yield all that is required for the\r\nnecessities of life. For instance, the New England plateau requires an\r\nenormous amount of fuel for its manufacturing enterprises; but\r\npractically no coal is found within its borders; hence the manufacturers\r\nmust either command the coal to be shipped from other regions or give up\r\ntheir employment. The people of Canada require a certain amount of\r\ncotton cloth; but the cotton plant will not grow in a cold climate, so\r\nthey must either exchange some of their own commodities for cotton, or\r\nelse go without it. The inhabitants of Great Britain produce only a\r\nsmall part of the food-stuffs they consume; therefore they are\r\nconstantly exchanging their manufactured products for the food-stuffs\r\nthat of necessity must be produced in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe dwellers of the New England plateau might grow the bread-stuffs they\r\nrequire, and in times past they did so. At that time, however, a barrel\r\nof flour was worth twelve dollars. But the wheat of the prairie regions\r\ncan be grown, manufactured into flour, transported a thousand miles, and\r\nsold at a profit for less than five dollars a barrel. Therefore it is\r\nevidently more economical to buy flour in Minnesota than to grow the\r\nwheat and make it into flour in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nAll these problems, and they exist without number, show that man may\r\novercome most of the obstacles that surround him. So we find civilized\r\nman living in almost every part of the world. Tropical regions are not\r\ntoo scorching, nor are arctic fastnesses too cold for him. In other\r\nwords, because of commerce and transportation, he can and usually does\r\nmaster the conditions of his environment; his intelligence enables him\r\nto do so, and his ability to do so is the result of the intelligent use\r\nof experience and education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHOW COMMERCE CIVILIZED MANKIND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of western civilization is so closely connected with the\r\ndevelopment of the great routes of travel and the growth of commerce\r\nthat one cannot possibly separate them. Commerce cannot exist without\r\nthe intercourse of peoples, and peoples cannot be in mutual\r\ncommunication unless each learns from the other.\r\n\r\n=Feudalism.=--When the Roman Empire fell civilization in western Europe\r\nwas not on a high plane; indeed, the feudalism that followed was not\r\nmuch above barbarism. The people were living in a manner that was not\r\nvery much unlike the communal system under which the serfs of Russia\r\nlived only a few years ago. Each centre of population was a sort of\r\nmilitary camp governed by a feudal lord. The followers and retainers\r\nwere scarcely better off than slaves; indeed, many of them were slaves.\r\nThere was no ownership of the land except by the feudal lords, and the\r\nlatter were responsible for their acts to the king only.\r\n\r\nBut very few people cared to be absolutely free, because they had but\r\nlittle chance to protect themselves; so it was the common custom to\r\nattach one\'s self to a feudal lord in order to have his protection; even\r\na sort of peonage or slavery under him was better than no protection at\r\nall. A few of the people were engaged in trade and manufacture of some\r\nkind or other, and they were the only ones through whom the feudal lord\r\ncould supply himself with the commodities needed for his retainers and\r\nthe luxuries necessary to himself.\r\n\r\nEach feudal estate, therefore, became a sort of industrial centre by\r\nitself, producing its own food-stuffs and much of the coarser\r\nmanufactures. It was not a very high condition of enlightenment, but it\r\nwas much better than the one which preceded it, for at least it offered\r\nprotection. It encouraged a certain amount of trade and commerce,\r\nbecause the feudal lord had many wants, and he was usually willing to\r\nprotect the merchant who supplied them.\r\n\r\n=The Crusades and Commerce.=--The Crusades, or wars by which the\r\nChristians sought to recover the Holy Land from the Turk, resulted in a\r\ntrade between Europe and India that grew to wonderful proportions. Silk\r\nfabrics, cotton cloth, precious stones, ostrich plumes, ivory, spices,\r\nand drugs--all of which were practically unknown in Europe--were eagerly\r\nsought by the nobility and their dependencies. In return, linen and\r\nwoollen fabrics, leather goods, glassware, blacklead, and steel\r\nimplements were carried to the far East.\r\n\r\nMilan, Florence, Venice and Genoa, Constantinople and a number of less\r\nimportant towns along the Mediterranean basin became important trade\r\ncentres, but Venice and Genoa grew to be world powers in commerce. Not\r\nonly were they great receiving and distributing depots of trade, but\r\nthey were great manufacturing centres as well.\r\n\r\nThe routes over which this enormous commerce was carried were few in\r\nnumber. For the greater part, the Venetian trade went to Alexandria, and\r\nthence by the Red Sea to India. Genoese merchants sent their goods to\r\nConstantinople and Trebizond, thence down the Tigris River to the\r\nPersian Gulf and to India. There was also another route that had been\r\nused by the Phoenicians. It extended from Tyre through Damascus and\r\nPalmyra[2] to the head of the Persian Gulf; this gradually fell into\r\ndisuse after the founding of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThe general effects of this trade were very far-reaching. To the greater\r\nnumber of the people of Europe, the countries of India, China, and Japan\r\nwere mythical. According to tradition they were infested with dragons\r\nand gryphons, and peopled by dog-headed folk or by one-eyed Arimaspians.\r\nAbout the first real information of them to be spread over Europe was\r\nbrought by Marco Polo, whose father and uncle had travelled all through\r\nthese countries during the latter part of the thirteenth century.[3]\r\nMarco Polo\'s writings were very widely read, and influenced a great many\r\npeople who could not be reached through the ordinary channels of\r\ncommerce. So between the wars of the Crusades on the one hand, and the\r\ngrowth of commerce on the other, a new and a better civilization began\r\nto spread over Europe.\r\n\r\n=The Turkish Invasions.=--But the magnificent trade that had thus grown up\r\nwas checked for a time by an unforeseen factor. The half-savage\r\nTurkomans living southeast of Russia had become converted to the\r\nreligion of Islam, and in their zeal for the new belief, determined to\r\ndestroy the commerce which seemed to be connected with Christianity. So\r\nthey moved in upon the borderland between Europe and Asia, and one after\r\nanother the trade routes were tightly closed. Then they captured\r\nConstantinople, and the routes between Genoa and the Orient were\r\nhermetically sealed. Moslem power also spread over Syria and Egypt, and\r\nso, little by little, the trade of Venice was throttled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUTES TO INDIA--THE TURK CHANGES THE COMMERCE OF THE\r\nWORLD]\r\n\r\nNow a commerce that involved not only many millions of dollars, but the\r\nemployment of thousands of people as well, is not likely to be given up\r\nwithout a struggle. So the energy that had been devoted to this great\r\ntrade was turned in a new direction, and there began a search for a new\r\nroute to India--one that the Turks could not blockade.\r\n\r\n=The Search for an All-Water Route to India.=--Overland routes were out of\r\nthe question; there were none that could be made available, and so the\r\nsearch was made for a sea-route. Rather singularly the Venetians and\r\nGenoese, who had hitherto controlled this trade, took no part in the\r\nsearch; it was conducted by the Spanish and the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile, fitted out an\r\nexpedition under Christopher Columbus, a master-mariner and\r\ncartographer, the funds being provided by Isabella, who pledged her\r\nprivate property as security for the cost of the expedition. This\r\nexpedition resulted in the discovery, October 10-21, 1492, of the West\r\nIndia Islands. In a subsequent voyage, Columbus discovered the mainland\r\nof South America.\r\n\r\nEven before the voyage of Columbus, the Portuguese had been trying to\r\nfind a way around Africa to India, and Pope Eugenius IV. had conferred\r\non Portugal "all heathen lands from Cape Bojador eastward even to the\r\nIndies." Little by little, therefore, Portuguese navigators were pushing\r\nsouthward until, in 1487, Bartholomew Dias sighted the Cape of Good\r\nHope, and got about as far as Algoa Bay. Then he unwillingly turned back\r\nbecause of the threats of his crew. It was a most remarkable voyage, and\r\none of the shipmates of Dias was Bartholomew Columbus, a brother of the\r\ndiscoverer of the New World.\r\n\r\nTen years later, or five years after the voyage of Columbus, Vasco da\r\nGama sailed from Lisbon for the Cape of Good Hope. As he passed the Cape\r\nhe was terribly storm-tossed, but the storms carried him in a fortunate\r\ndirection. And when at last he got his reckonings, he was off the coast\r\nof India; he therefore kept along the coast until in sight of a port.\r\nThe port was the well-known city of Calicut. Two years later he returned\r\nto Europe by the same route, his ships laden with spices, precious\r\nstones, beautiful tapestries and brocades, ivory and bronzes. The\r\nlong-sought sea-route to India had been discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HANSE CITY--HAMBURG, ALONG THE WATER-FRONT]\r\n\r\n=Commerce in Western Europe.=--After the discovery of the new route,\r\nVenice and Genoa were scarcely heard of in relation to commerce; they\r\nlost everything and gained nothing. The great commerce with the Orient\r\nwas to have a new western terminus, and the latter was to be on the\r\nshores of the North and Baltic Seas.\r\n\r\nThe commerce between Europe and India stimulated trade in western Europe\r\nas well. As early as the twelfth century the manufacture of linen and\r\nwoollen cloth had grown to be a very important industry that had\r\nresulted in the rapid growth of population. The older cities grew\r\nrapidly, and new ones sprang up wherever the commodities of trade were\r\ngathered, manufactured, or distributed.\r\n\r\nThese centres of trade had two hostile elements against them. The feudal\r\nlords used to pillage them legally by extorting heavy taxes and forced\r\nloans whenever their treasuries were empty. The portionless brothers and\r\nrelatives of the feudal lords, to whom no employments save war,\r\nadventure, and piracy were open, pillaged them illegally. Along the\r\ncoasts especially, piracy was considered not only a legitimate, but a\r\ngenteel, profession. So in order to protect themselves, the cities began\r\nto join themselves into leagues.\r\n\r\n=The Hanse League.=--About the beginning of the thirteenth century[4]\r\nHamburg and L\xc3\xbcbeck formed an alliance afterward called a _hansa_; at the\r\nbeginning of the fourteenth century it embraced seventy cities, having\r\nthe capital at L\xc3\xbcbeck. At the time of its greatest power the League\r\nembraced all the principal cities of western Europe nearly as far south\r\nas the Danube. Large agencies, called "factories," were established in\r\nLondon, Bruges, Novgorod, Bergen, and Wisby. The influence of the League\r\npractically controlled western Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Hanse League performed a wonderful work. It stopped piracy on the\r\nseas and robbery on the land. Industrially, it encouraged\r\nself-government and obedience to constitutional authority. Shipbuilding\r\nand navigation so greatly improved that the ocean traffic resulting from\r\nthe discovery of the cape route to India quickly fell into the hands of\r\nHanse sailors and master-mariners. The League not only encouraged and\r\nprotected all sorts of manufactures, but its schools trained thousands\r\nof operatives. The mines were worked and the idle land cultivated. It\r\nwas the greatest industrial movement that ever occurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HANSE ROUTES--THE HANSE LEAGUE REORGANIZES THE TRADE OF\r\nTHE WORLD]\r\n\r\nSocially, the Hanse League brought the wealth that gave those comforts\r\nand conveniences before unknown. The standards of social life,\r\neducation, art, and science were raised from a condition scarcely\r\nbetter than barbarism to a high plane of civilization. Indeed, the\r\ncivilization of western Europe was the most important result of it.\r\n\r\nIt forced the rights of individual freedom, as well as municipal\r\nindependence, from more than one monarch, and punished severely the\r\nkings who sought to betray it. It crushed the power of those who opposed\r\nit,[5] and rewarded those who were faithful to it. Its most important\r\nmission, however, was the overthrow of feudalism and the gradual\r\nsubstitution of popular government in its place.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished the regeneration of Europe, the Hanse League died\r\npartly by its own hand, because of its arrogance, but mainly from the\r\nfact that, having educated western Europe to self-government and\r\ncommercial independence, there was no longer need for its existence.\r\nIndependent cities grew rapidly into importance, and these got along\r\nvery well without the protection of the League. The great industrial\r\nprogress was at times temporarily checked by wars, but it never took a\r\nbackward step. Indeed the progress of commerce has always been a contest\r\nbetween brains and brute force, and in such a struggle there is never\r\nany doubt about the final outcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat were some of the effects of C\xc3\xa6sar\'s invasion of Germanic Europe so\r\nfar as commerce is concerned?\r\n\r\nWhat were some of the effects on commerce of the breaking up of the\r\nRoman Empire?\r\n\r\nHow did the invasion of England by William of Normandy affect the\r\ncommerce of the English people?\r\n\r\nWho was Henry the Navigator, and what did he accomplish?\r\n\r\nHow did the blockade of the routes between Europe and India bring about\r\nthe discovery of America?\r\n\r\nWhat was the result of the great voyage of the Cabots?\r\n\r\nWas the overthrow of feudalism in Europe a gain or a loss to commerce?\r\n\r\nWhy are not commercial leagues, such as the Hanse, necessary at the\r\npresent time?\r\n\r\nWhy did Spain\'s commerce decline as Portugal\'s thrived?\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLATERAL READING[6]\r\n\r\nGibbins\'s History of Commerce--Chapters IV-V.\r\n\r\nFiske\'s Discovery of America, Vol. 1--Chapters IV-V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTOPOGRAPHIC CONTROL OF COMMERCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great industry of commerce, which includes both the trade in the\r\ncommodities of life and the transportation of them, is governed very\r\nlargely by the character of the earth\'s surface. But very few\r\nfood-stuffs can be grown economically in mountain-regions. Steep\r\nmountain-slopes are apt to be destitute of soil; moreover, even the\r\nmountain-valleys are apt to be difficult of access, and in such cases\r\nthe cost of moving the crops may be greater than the market value of the\r\nproducts. Mountainous countries, therefore, are apt to be sparsely\r\npeopled regions.\r\n\r\nBut although the great mountain-systems are unhabitable, or at least\r\nsparsely peopled, they have a very definite place in the economics of\r\nlife. Thus, the great western highland of the United States diverts the\r\nflow of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the central\r\nplain, and gives to the region most of its food-growing power. In a\r\nsimilar manner, moisture intercepted by the Alps and the Himalayas has\r\nnot only created the plains of the Po and the Ganges from the rock-waste\r\ncarried from the slopes, but has also made them exceedingly fertile.\r\n\r\nMountain-ranges are also valuable for their contents. The broken\r\ncondition of the rock-folds and the rapid weathering to which they are\r\nsubjected have exposed the minerals and metals so useful in the arts of\r\ncommerce and civilization. Thus, the weathering of the Appalachian folds\r\nhas made accessible about the only available anthracite coal measures\r\nyet worked; and the worn folds about Lake Superior have yielded the\r\nores that have made the United States the foremost copper and steel\r\nmanufacturing country of the world. Gold, silver, tin, lead, zinc,\r\nplatinum, granite, slate, and marble occur mainly in mountain-folds.\r\n\r\n=Mountains and Valleys.=--Mountain-ranges are great obstacles to commerce\r\nand intercommunication. The Greek peoples found it much easier to\r\nscatter along the Mediterranean coast than to cross the Balkan\r\nMountains. For twenty years after the settlement of California, it was\r\neasier and less expensive to send traffic by way of Cape Horn than to\r\ncarry it across the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe deep ca\xc3\xb1ons of mountainous regions are quite as difficult to\r\novercome as the high ranges. In modern methods of transportation a range\r\nthat cannot be surmounted may be tunnelled, and a tunnel five or six\r\nmiles in length is no uncommon feat of engineering. A ca\xc3\xb1on, however,\r\ncannot be tunnelled, and if too wide for cantilever or suspension\r\nbridges, a detour of many miles is necessary. In crossing a deep chasm\r\nthe route of transportation may aggregate ten or fifteen times the\r\ndistance spanned by a straight line.\r\n\r\nExcepting the mining regions, the population of mountainous countries is\r\napt to be found mainly in the intermontane valleys. A reason for this is\r\nnot hard to find; the valleys are usually filled with rich soil brought\r\nfrom the higher slopes and levelled by the water. The population,\r\ntherefore, is concentrated in the valley because of the food-producing\r\npower of the land. For this reason the Sound, Willamette, and San\r\nJoaquin-Sacramento Valleys contain the chief part of the Pacific coast\r\npopulation. The Shenandoah and the Great Valley of Virginia are similar\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the larger intermontane valleys is true also of the\r\nnarrow stream valleys of mountain and plateau regions. Thus, in the New\r\nEngland plateau the chief growth during the past forty years has been in\r\nthe valley lands. In that time if the uplands have not suffered actual\r\nloss, they certainly have made no material gains. Upland farming has not\r\nproved a remunerative venture, and many of the farms have either been\r\nabandoned or converted to other uses.\r\n\r\n=Passes.=--Transverse valleys form very important topographic features of\r\nmountain-regions. Inasmuch as the ranges themselves are obstacles to\r\ncommunication, it follows that the latter must be concentrated at such\r\ncross valleys or gaps as may be traversed. Khaibar Pass, a narrow defile\r\nin the Hindu Kush Mountains, between Peshawur and Jelalabad, for many\r\nyears was the chief gateway between Europe and India. Even now the cost\r\nof holding it is an enormous tax upon England.\r\n\r\nBrenner, St. Gotthard, and the Mont Cenis Passes are about the only land\r\nchannels of commerce between Italy and transalpine Europe, and most of\r\nthe communication between northern Italy and the rest of Europe is\r\ncarried on by means of these passes. Every transcontinental railway of\r\nthe American continent crosses the various highlands by means of gaps\r\nand passes, and some of them would never have been built were it not for\r\nthe existence of the passes. Fremont, South, and Marshall Passes have\r\nbeen of historic importance for half a century.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson and Champlain Valley played an important part in the history\r\nof the colonies a century before the existence of the United States, and\r\nits importance as a gateway to eastern Canada is not likely to be\r\nlessened. The Mohawk gap was the first practical route to be maintained\r\nbetween the Atlantic seaboard and the food-producing region of the Great\r\nCentral Plain. It is to-day the most important one. It is so nearly\r\nlevel that the total lift of freight going from Buffalo to tide-water is\r\nless than five hundred feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PASS--THE ROUTE OF A RAILWAY]\r\n\r\n=Rivers.=--River-valleys are closely connected with the economic\r\ndevelopment of a country. Navigable rivers are free and open highways of\r\ncommunication. In newly settled countries the river is always the least\r\nexpensive means of carriage, and often it is the only one available for\r\nthe transportation of heavy goods.\r\n\r\nIn late years, since the railway has become the chief means for the\r\ntransportation of commodities, river transportation has greatly\r\ndeclined. The river-valley, however, has lost none of its importance; in\r\nmost instances it is a naturally levelled and graded route, highly\r\nsuitable for the tracks of the railway. As a result, outside of the\r\nlevel lands of the Great Central Plain, not far from eighty per cent. of\r\nthe railway mileage of the United States is constructed along\r\nriver-valleys.\r\n\r\n=Plateaus.=--Plateaus are usually characterized by broken and more or less\r\nrugged surface features. As a rule they are deficient in the amount of\r\nrainfall necessary to produce an abundance of the grains and similar\r\nfood-stuffs, although this is by no means the case with all.\r\n\r\nMost plateaus produce an abundance of grass, and cattle-growing is\r\ntherefore an important industry in such regions. Thus, the plateaus of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains are famous for cattle, and the same is true of the\r\nMexican and the South American plateaus. The Iberian plateau, including\r\nSpain and Portugal, is noted for the merino sheep, which furnish the\r\nfinest wool known. The plateau of Iran is also noted for its wool, and\r\nthe rugs from this region cannot be imitated elsewhere in the world.\r\n\r\n=Plains.=--Plains are of the highest importance to life and its\r\nactivities. Not only do they present fewer obstacles to\r\nintercommunication than any other topographic features, but almost\r\nalways they are deeply covered with the fine rock-waste that forms the\r\nchief components of soil. Plains, therefore, contain the elements of\r\nnutrition, and are capable of supporting life to a greater extent than\r\neither mountains or plateaus. About ninety per cent. of the world\'s\r\npopulation dwell in the lowland plains.\r\n\r\nThe Great Central Plain of North America produces more than one-quarter\r\nof the world\'s wheat, and about four-fifths of the corn. The southern\r\npart of the great Arctic plain, and its extension, the plains of the\r\nBaltic also yield immense quantities of grain and cattle products. The\r\ncoast-plains of the Atlantic Ocean, on both the American and the\r\nEuropean side, are highly productive.\r\n\r\nRiver flood-plains are almost always densely peopled because of their\r\nproductivity. The bottom-lands of the Mississippi and the Yangtze Rivers\r\nare among the chief food-producing regions of the world. Lacustrine\r\nplains, the beds of former lakes, are also highly productive regions.\r\nThe valley of the Red River of the North is an example, and its wheat is\r\nof a very high quality.\r\n\r\nFertile coast-plains and lowlands that are adjacent to good harbors, as\r\na rule are the most thickly peopled regions of the world. In many such\r\nregions the density of population exceeds two hundred or more per square\r\nmile. The reason is obvious. Life seeks that environment which yields\r\nthe greatest amount of nutrition with the least expenditure of energy.\r\n\r\nThe study of a good relief map shows that, as a rule, the Pacific Ocean\r\nis bordered by a rugged highland, which has a more or less abrupt slope,\r\nand a narrow coast-plain. Indeed, the latter is absent for the greater\r\npart. The slopes of the Atlantic, on the other hand, are long and\r\ngentle--being a thousand miles or more in width throughout the greater\r\npart of their extent. The area of productive land is correspondingly\r\ngreat, and the character of the surface features is such that\r\nintercommunication is easy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RIVER FLOOD-PLAIN--A REGION ADAPTED TO CULTIVATION]\r\n\r\nThe result of these conditions is evident. The Atlantic slopes, though\r\nnot everywhere the most densely peopled areas, contain the great centres\r\nof the world\'s activities and economies. In the past 400 years they have\r\nnot only overtaken the Pacific coast races, but have far surpassed them.\r\nThey are now entering upon a commercial invasion of the Pacific nations\r\nthat is resulting in a reorganization of the entire industrial world.\r\n\r\n=Topography and Trade Routes.=--As the settlement and commerce of a\r\ncountry grow, roads succeed trails, and trails are apt to follow the\r\npaths of migrating animals. Until the time of the Civil War in the\r\nUnited States, most of the great highways of the country were the direct\r\ndescendants of "buffalo roads," as they were formerly called.\r\n\r\nIn the crossing of divides from one river-valley to another, the\r\nmountain-sections of the railways for the greater part follow the trails\r\nof the bison. This is especially marked in the Pennsylvania, the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio, and the Chesapeake and Ohio railways; in some\r\ninstances the tunnels through ranges have been constructed directly\r\nunder the trails. The reason is obvious; the instinct of the bison led\r\nhim along routes having the minimum of grade.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Mississippi Valley and the great plains the Indian trails\r\nusually avoided the bottom-lands of the river-valleys, following the\r\ndivides and portages instead. This selection of routes was probably due\r\nto the fact that the lowlands were swampy and subject to overflow; the\r\nportages and divides offered no steep grades, and were therefore more\r\neasily traversed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE COMMODITIES ARE EXCHANGED--NEW YORK CITY\r\nWATER-FRONT]\r\n\r\n=Harbors.=--Coast outlines have much to do with the commercial\r\npossibilities of a region. The "drowned valleys" and similar inlets\r\nalong the North Atlantic coast, both of Europe and America, form harbors\r\nin which vessels ride at anchor in safety, no matter what the existing\r\nconditions outside may be. As a result, the two greatest centres of\r\ncommerce in the world are found at these harbors--one on the American,\r\nthe other on the European coast.\r\n\r\nFrom New York Bay southward along the Atlantic seaboard there are but\r\nfew harbors, and this accounts for the enormous development of commerce\r\nin the stretch of coast between Portland and Baltimore. San Francisco\r\nBay and the harbors of Puget Sound monopolize most of the commerce of\r\nthe Pacific coast of the United States. South America has several good\r\nharbors on the Atlantic seaboard, and in consequence a large city has\r\ngrown at the site of each. On the Pacific coast the good harbors are\r\nvery few in number, and they are not situated near productive regions.\r\n\r\nAsiatic peoples, as a rule, are not promoters of foreign commerce, and,\r\nthose of Japan excepted, the only good harbors are those that have been\r\nimproved by European governments. These are confined mainly to India and\r\nChina. The many possible harbors make certain a tremendous commerce in\r\nthe future. Africa has but very few good harbors. There are excellent\r\nharbors in the islands of the Pacific, and many of them are of great\r\nstrategic value as coaling stations and bases of supply to the various\r\nmaritime powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad has found it more economical to tunnel the\r\nmountain-range under Horseshoe Curve, near Altoona, than to haul the\r\ntrains over the mountains; discuss the details in which there will be a\r\nsaving.\r\n\r\nWhy are rugged and mountainous regions apt to be sparsely peopled?\r\n\r\nThe first valuable discovery in the Rocky Mountains was gold; what were\r\nthe chief effects that resulted?\r\n\r\nWould the industries of the Pacific coast of the United States be\r\nbenefited or impaired by the existence of a coast-plain?\r\n\r\nWhich are more conducive to commerce--the large mediterraneans, such as\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, or the small estuaries, such as New York Bay?\r\nDiscuss the merits or demerits of each.\r\n\r\nWhat are the chief products of mountains, of plateaus, of lowland\r\nplains?\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nAdams\'s New Empire--Chapter I.\r\n\r\nRedway\'s Physical Geography--Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nA topographic map of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEAN ANNUAL RAINFALL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCLIMATIC CONTROL OF COMMERCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its effect upon life and the various industries of peoples, climate\r\nis a factor even more important than topography. Of the 53,000,000\r\nsquare miles of the land surface of the earth, scarcely more than\r\none-half is capable of producing any great amount of food-stuffs, and\r\nonly a very small area can support a population of more than one hundred\r\npeople to each square mile.\r\n\r\n=Climate and Habitability.=--In the main, regions that are inhabited by\r\nhuman beings produce either food-stuffs or something of value that may\r\nbe exchanged for food-stuffs; and inasmuch as food and shelter are the\r\nchief objects of human activity, regions that will not furnish them are\r\nnot habitable.\r\n\r\nThe growth and production of food-stuffs is governed even more by\r\nconditions of climate than by those of topography. Thus the great\r\nRussian plain is too cold to produce any great amount of food-stuffs,\r\nand it is, therefore, sparsely peopled. The northern part of Africa and\r\nthe closed basins of North America and Asia lack the rainfall necessary\r\nto insure productivity, and these regions are also unhabitable. The\r\nbasin of the Amazon has a rainfall too great for cereals and grasses,\r\nand the larger part of it is unfit for habitation.\r\n\r\nAll the food-stuffs are exceedingly sensitive to climate. Rice will not\r\ngrow where swampy conditions do not prevail at least during part of the\r\nyear. Turf-grass will not live where there are repeated droughts of more\r\nthan three months\' duration, and corn will not ripen in regions having\r\ncool nights. Wheat does not produce a kernel fit for flour anywhere\r\nexcept in the temperate zone; and the banana will not grow outside the\r\ntorrid zone.\r\n\r\nThe two chief factors of climate are temperature and moisture. No forms\r\nof life can withstand a temperature constantly below the freezing-point\r\nof water, and but few, if any, can endure a constant heat of one hundred\r\nand twenty-five degrees, although most species can exist at temperatures\r\nbeyond these limits for a short time.\r\n\r\n=Zones of Climate.=--The belt of earth upon which the sun\'s rays are\r\nnearly or quite vertical is comparatively narrow. But the inclination of\r\nthe earth\'s axis and the fact that it is parallel to itself at all times\r\nof the year create zones of climate. These differ materially in the\r\ncharacter of the life, forms, and the activities of the people who dwell\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nIn the torrid zone the temperature varies but little. During the season\r\nof rains it rarely falls to 70\xc2\xb0 F., and in the dry season it is seldom\r\nhigher than 95\xc2\xb0 F. As a result, all sorts of plants that are sensitive\r\nto low temperatures thrive in the torrid zone. It is not a climate\r\nsuitable for heat-producing food-plants, and they are not required.\r\n\r\nThe constant heat and excessive moisture of the atmosphere in the torrid\r\nzone is apt to produce a feeling of lassitude among the dwellers in such\r\nregions, moreover, and great bodily activity is out of question. These\r\nconditions seriously affect the lives of the people, and, with few\r\nexceptions, tropical peoples are rarely noted for energy or enterprise.\r\nGreat commercial enterprises are the exception rather than the rule, and\r\nthey are usually carried on by foreigners who must live a part of the\r\ntime in cooler localities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EFFECTS OF HIGH LATITUDE--TOO COLD TO PRODUCE\r\nBREAD-STUFFS]\r\n\r\nPolar regions are deficient both in the heat and light necessary for\r\nfood-stuffs. Neither the grasses nor the grains fructify. As a result,\r\nbut few herbivora can live there, and these are practically restricted\r\nto the musk-ox and the reindeer, which subsist on mosses and lichens.\r\nThe native people are stunted in growth; their food consists mainly of\r\nraw blubber, and they are scarcely above savagery.\r\n\r\nThe temperate zones are the regions of the great industries and\r\nactivities of human life. The larger part of the land surface of the\r\nearth is situated in these zones; moreover, the people who dominate the\r\nworld also live in them, and their supremacy is due largely to\r\nconditions of climate. The alternation of summer and winter causes a\r\nstruggle for existence that develops the intellectual faculties and\r\nresults in industrial supremacy.\r\n\r\n=Effects of Altitude.=--There is a decrease of temperature of 1\xc2\xb0 F. for\r\nabout every three hundred feet of ascent. But few people live at an\r\naltitude of more than six thousand feet above sea-level, and in many\r\ncases they depend on other localities for the greater part of their\r\nfood-stuffs, because very few of such regions produce food-stuffs\r\nabundantly.\r\n\r\nThe chief exceptions to this rule are found in tropical regions. The\r\nhighlands of Mexico, the plateau-regions of Bolivia and Ecuador, and the\r\nhighlands of southern Asia are habitable, but they are not densely\r\npeopled. Because of their altitude they are relieved of the enervating\r\neffects of tropical climate at the sea-level.\r\n\r\nAltitude likewise affects the amount of rainfall. Most plateaus are\r\narid. As a rule, they are arid because of their altitude; and because of\r\ntheir aridity they are deficient in their power to produce food-stuffs.\r\nThey are therefore sparsely peopled.\r\n\r\n=Effects of Rainfall.=--Regions having considerably more than one hundred\r\ninches of rain annually are very apt to be forest-covered, and\r\ntherefore to be deficient in food-producing plants. Such localities have\r\nusually a sparse population, in spite of the profusion of vegetation. In\r\nsome parts of India, lands that have been left idle for a few seasons\r\nproduce such a dense jungle of wild vegetation that to reclaim them for\r\ncultivation is wellnigh impossible.\r\n\r\nA deficiency of rainfall is even a greater factor in restricting the\r\ndensity of population than too much rain. With less than fifteen or\r\ntwenty inches a year few regions produce good crops of grains and\r\ngrasses, and as a result they are sparsely peopled. Some of the\r\nexceptions, however, are important. If the rainfall is not quite enough\r\nto produce a normal overflow to the sea, the soil may be very rich,\r\nbecause the nutrition is not leached out and carried away.\r\n\r\nMany small areas of this character produce enormous crops when\r\nartificially watered, and many of them, such as Persia, parts of Asia\r\nMinor, northern Utah, and large areas of Australia and Chile have become\r\nregions of considerable commercial importance. The products of such\r\nregions are apt to be unique in character and of unusual value. Thus,\r\nthe wool of Persia and Australia and the fruit of the Iberian peninsula\r\nare important articles of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt one may see the results of irrigated lands. The area of\r\ngeographical Egypt is somewhat less than half a million square miles;\r\nthe habitable part of the country is confined to a narrow strip, which,\r\none or two places excepted, varies from three to six miles in width. In\r\nother words, almost the whole population of the country is massed in the\r\nflood-plain and delta of the Nile; the remaining part is a desert\r\nproducing practically nothing.\r\n\r\nThe water that makes these lands productive falls, not in Egypt, but in\r\nthe highlands of Abyssinia, 2,000 miles away. The September overflow of\r\nthe flood-plain is the chief factor in the irrigation of these lands,\r\nbut the area has been greatly increased by the construction of barrages\r\nand dams at Assiut and Assuan.\r\n\r\nIn the western highland region of the United States considerable areas\r\nalready have been made productive by irrigation, and it is estimated\r\nthat about two million acres of barren land can be reclaimed by\r\nimpounding the waters of the various streams now running to waste.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of rain with respect to the season in which it falls is\r\nquite as important as its distribution with respect to quantity. In\r\ntropical regions the ocean winds, and therefore the rainfall, come from\r\nthe east. The eastern slopes of such regions, therefore, have a season\r\nin which rains may be expected daily, and another in which no rain falls\r\nfor several months. In the temperate zones seasonal rains for a similar\r\nreason are on the western coasts.\r\n\r\nThus on the Pacific coast of the United States the rainfall varies from\r\nabout one hundred inches in southern Alaska to about twelve in San\r\nDiego, Cal. Practically all the rain falls between October and the\r\nfollowing May; very little or none falls in the interval between May and\r\nOctober. As a result, ordinary turf-grass, which will not withstand long\r\ndroughts, grows in only a few localities of the Pacific slope. It is\r\nreplaced by hardier grasses whose roots, instead of forming turf, grow\r\nvery deep in the soil.\r\n\r\nCommon clover will not grow in this region unless irrigated; it is\r\nreplaced by burr-clover, a variety of the plant that will not thrive in\r\nmoist regions. Now the quality of the merino wool clip of California\r\ndepends in no slight degree upon the burr-clover and other food-products\r\nthat thrive in regions of seasonal rains; that is, a great commercial\r\nindustry exists because of this feature of rainfall, and it could not\r\nlong survive in spite of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLIMATICALLY ADAPTED TO CULTIVATION--THE LOWLANDS\r\nPRODUCE BREAD-STUFFS AND FRUIT; THE MOUNTAIN-SLOPES ARE GRAZING REGIONS]\r\n\r\nThe seasonal rainfall also affects other agricultural industries. The\r\nsacked wheat-crop may be left in the field without cover or protection\r\nuntil the time is convenient for shipping it. The absence of summer\r\nrains makes possible in California what would be out of question in the\r\nMississippi Valley, where a rainstorm may be expected every few days.\r\n\r\nThe quality of certain fruits depends largely on the season during which\r\nthe rainfall occurs. Apples, pears, and grapes grown in regions having\r\ndry summers have usually a very superior flavor. The raisin-making\r\nindustry of California also depends on the same condition, because, in\r\norder to insure a good quality of the product, the bunches of grapes,\r\nafter picking, must be dried on the ground. To a certain extent this is\r\nalso true of other fruits, such as dates, figs, and prunes, which\r\nfrequently are sun-dried.\r\n\r\nThe presence of large bodies of water, which both absorb and give out\r\ntheir heat very slowly, tempers the climate of the nearby land and to\r\nthat extent modifies the commerce of such districts. The grape-growing\r\nindustry of central New York is a great one and its product is famous.\r\nIts existence depends almost wholly upon the lake-tempered climate.\r\nElsewhere in the State the industry is on a precarious basis, and the\r\nproduct is inferior.\r\n\r\n=Effects of Inclination of the Earth\'s Axis.=--The inclination and\r\nself-parallelism of the earth\'s axis is undoubtedly a very important\r\nfactor in climate. Practically it more than doubles the width of the\r\nbelts of ordinary food-stuffs by lengthening the summer day in the\r\ntemperate zone. Beyond the tropics the obliquity of the sun\'s rays are\r\nmore than balanced by the increased length of time in which they fall.\r\n\r\nThus, in the latitude of St. Paul, the longest day is about fifteen and\r\none-half hours long; at Liverpool it is nearly seventeen hours long; a\r\ngreater number of heat units therefore are received in these latitudes\r\nduring summer than are received in equatorial regions during the\r\ntwelve-hour day. Moreover, the summer temperature is higher in these\r\nlatitudes than in the torrid zone, because the sun is shining upon them\r\nfor a greater length of time.\r\n\r\nThe result of these various influences is far-reaching. Because of the\r\nlong summer days and short nights, wheat can be cultivated to the\r\nsixtieth parallel. Corn, which gets scarcely enough warmth and light in\r\nthe torrid zone to become a prolific crop, attains its greatest yield in\r\nthe latitude of fourteen-hour days.\r\n\r\nThese factors, it is evident, carry the grain and meat industries into\r\nregions that otherwise would not be habitable. Because the long summer\r\ndays produce these great food-crops, commerce and its allied industries\r\nhave reached their maximum development in these regions. Human\r\nactivities are greatest in the zones bounded by the thirty-fifth and\r\nfifty-fifth parallels, the zone that includes the greater parts of the\r\nUnited States, Europe, China, Japan. They are greatest, moreover,\r\nbecause of their geographical position.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat would be the probable effect on the food-crops of the United States\r\nwere the main body of the country moved twenty degrees north in\r\nlatitude? Which would then be the wheat-growing States, the\r\ncotton-producing States?\r\n\r\nIllustrate the connection between occupation and altitude above\r\nsea-level.\r\n\r\nWhat difference would it make to the corn-crop were the days and nights\r\nalways twelve hours long?\r\n\r\nWhat would be requisite to make Canada a centre of silk production?\r\n\r\nWhy is not cod-fishing an industry off the east coast of Florida?\r\n\r\nWhy is the greater part of the Russian Empire destined to be sparsely\r\npeopled?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL REFERENCE\r\n\r\nA rain chart of the world.\r\n\r\nA chart of isothermal lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION--OCEAN AND INLAND NAVIGATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the adjustments which come into the lives of a people none has\r\nbeen so far-reaching as the gradual localization of industries each in\r\nthe region best adapted to it. For instance, manufacturing industries\r\nrequire power, but not fertile soil; therefore the manufacturing\r\nindustries seek nearness to fuel or to water-power, and a position\r\navailable for quick transportation.\r\n\r\nFarming does not require any great amount of natural power; on the\r\ncontrary, level land having a great depth of fertile soil is the\r\nessential feature. The farmer must therefore look first of all to\r\nconditions of topography and climate, and secondly to the means of\r\ntransporting his crop.\r\n\r\nMining cannot be an industry in regions destitute of minerals; the miner\r\nmust therefore go where the mineral wealth is found, without regard to\r\nclimate, soil, centres of population, or topography. But two things are\r\nrequired--the mineral products and the means of getting them to the\r\npeople--that is, ready means of transportation.\r\n\r\nA century or more ago, each centre of population in the United States\r\nwas practically self-sustaining. Each grew its own food-stuffs, and\r\nmanufactured the articles used in the household. But very little was\r\nrequired in the way of transportation. The means of carriage were mainly\r\nox-carts, pack-horses, and rafts. There was a mutual independence among\r\nthe various centres, it is true, but the independence was at the expense\r\nof civilization and the comforts of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OCEAN TRANSPORTATION--ROYAL MAIL STEAMSHIP OCEANIC,\r\nWHITE STAR LINE]\r\n\r\nBeyond an independence that is more apparent than real, such a plan of\r\nsocial and industrial organization has but little in it to commend.\r\nIntercommunication increases knowledge, and under the conditions that\r\nformerly prevailed, there was a lack of the breadth of knowledge that\r\ncomes with the mutual contact of peoples.\r\n\r\nThe utilization of national resources, such as the productiveness of the\r\nland, the existence of iron ore, coal, copper, and other economic\r\nminerals, finally brought about the policy of a territorial division of\r\nindustries. This, in turn, made the prompt transportation and exchange\r\nof commodities essential; indeed, without such a plan, industrial\r\ncentres could not long exist.\r\n\r\nThe man whose sole business is manufacture must look to others for his\r\nsupply of food-stuffs and raw materials, and these are produced more\r\neconomically at a distance from the centre of manufacture. Thus England\r\nmust look to the United States for wheat and cotton, to the Australian\r\nCommonwealth for wool, and to New Zealand and the United States for\r\nmeat. Her chief wealth is in her coal and iron, and these make the\r\nnation a great manufacturing centre. So, also, the manufacturer of New\r\nYork must go to Pittsburg for steel, to Minneapolis for flour, and to\r\nChicago for beef.\r\n\r\nThe application of this principle is very broad; it is the foundation of\r\nall commerce, and it underlies modern civilization. For this reason the\r\nquestion of transportation is just as important to a community as the\r\nindustries of agriculture, mining, and manufacture. Food-stuffs are of\r\nno use unless they can be transported to the people who want them; nor\r\ncan peoples remain in unproductive regions unless the food-stuffs are\r\nbrought to them.\r\n\r\nThe gross tonnage of goods is transported mainly in one or another or\r\nall of three ways--namely, by animal power, by railway, or by water.\r\nThus, the cotton-crop of the United States is usually transported by\r\nwagon from the plantation to the nearest station or boat-landing; by\r\nrail or by barge to the nearest seaport; and by ocean steamship to the\r\nforeign seaport.\r\n\r\nWater transportation is more economical than land carriage, for the\r\nreason that less power is required to move a given tonnage through the\r\nwater than on the most perfectly graded railway. Steamship freights, as\r\na rule, are lower than those of sailing-vessels, because a steamship has\r\nmore than twice the speed, and, being larger, can carry a greater\r\ntonnage. Freight rates on the Great Lakes are higher per ton-mile than\r\non the ocean, because the vessels are necessarily smaller than those\r\nbuilt for ocean traffic. For a similar reason, river and canal freights\r\nare higher than lake freights. Railway transportation is economical,\r\npartly because a single locomotive will draw an enormous weight of\r\ngoods, and partly because of the high speed at which the goods move from\r\npoint to point. Animal transportation is more expensive than any other\r\nmeans ordinarily employed.\r\n\r\n=Ocean Transportation.=--In many respects, water-routes form the most\r\navailable and economical methods of transportation. Intercontinental\r\ncommerce must be carried on by means of deep-water vessels. Therefore an\r\nextraordinary development of ocean carriers has taken place in the past\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nOne important period of development began with the rise of American\r\ncommerce. Just after the close of the War for Independence, it was found\r\nthat deep-water ships could be built of New England timber for\r\nthirty-five dollars per ton, rated tonnage, while a vessel of the same\r\nburden built in Europe cost about forty-five dollars per unit of\r\ntonnage. Two types of vessels came into use--one, the clipper ship with\r\nsquare sails, was used for long ocean voyages; the other, the schooner,\r\nwith fore-and-aft rigging, was employed mainly in the coast-trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SQUARE-RIGGED SHIP--A TYPE NOW BEING REPLACED BY\r\nFORE-AND-AFT RIGGED SCHOONERS]\r\n\r\nIn speed and ease of management these vessels surpassed anything that\r\nhad ever sailed. In time they became the standards for the\r\nsailing-vessels of all the great commercial nations. The types of the\r\nvessels are still standards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN STEAMSHIP]\r\n\r\n=The Development of the Steamship.=--Another important era in ocean\r\ncommerce began when steam was used as a motive power for vessels. The\r\nfirst deep-water vessel thus to be propelled was the Savannah. Her\r\nsteam-power was merely incidental, however, and her paddle-wheels were\r\nunshipped and taken aboard when there was enough wind for sailing. Up\r\nto 1860 almost all the ocean steamships were side-wheelers, propelled by\r\nlow-pressure beam-engines.\r\n\r\nThe next most important improvement was the screw-blade propeller,\r\nplaced astern. This means of propulsion called for higher speed of the\r\nengines, and in a very short time compactly built high-pressure engines\r\ntook the place of the low-pressure engine with its heavy walking-beam.\r\nThe latter carried steam at a pressure varying from twenty to thirty-two\r\npounds; the modern boiler has steam at 260 pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\nOcean steamships have gradually evolved into two types. The freighter,\r\nbroad in beam and capacious, is built to carry an enormous amount of\r\nfreight at a moderate speed. The White Star liner Celtic is a vessel of\r\nthis class; her schedule time between New York and Liverpool is about\r\nnine days. The Philadelphia of the American line, though not the fastest\r\nsteamship, makes the same trip in an average time of five and one-half\r\ndays.[7]\r\n\r\nTwin-screws, instead of a single propeller, are employed on nearly all\r\nthe large liners. The gain in speed is not greatly increased, but the\r\nvessel is far more manageable with two screws than with one; moreover,\r\nif one engine breaks down, the vessel can make excellent time with the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nTriple-expansion engines are almost universally used on modern\r\nsteamships, and a pound of coal now makes about three times as much\r\nsteam available as in the engines formerly used. As a result a bushel of\r\nwheat is now carried from Fargo, N. Dak., to Liverpool for about\r\ntwenty-one cents--less than one-half the freight tariff of 1876.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SCHOONER THOMAS A. LAWSON. THE FIRST SEVEN-MASTED\r\nSAILING-VESSEL]\r\n\r\nThe fastest liners consume from three hundred and fifty to more than\r\nfour hundred tons of coal a day, and for each additional knot of speed\r\nthe amount of coal burned must be greatly increased. Freighters like the\r\nCeltic consume scarcely more than half as much as those of the Kaiser\r\nWilhelm II. type.\r\n\r\n=Sailing-Craft.=--In spite of the growth and development of\r\nsteam-navigation, a large amount of freight is still carried by\r\nsailing-craft; moreover, it is not unlikely that the relative proportion\r\nof ocean freight carried by sailing-vessels will increase rather than\r\ndecrease, especially in the case of imperishable freight.\r\n\r\nThe square-rigged ship, or bark, has been very largely replaced by the\r\nfore-and-aft, or schooner-rigged vessel. A large full-rigged ship\r\nrequires a crew of thirty to thirty-six men; a schooner-rigged vessel\r\nneeds from sixteen to twenty. These vessels are commonly built with\r\nthree and four masts; some of the largest have six or seven. They carry\r\nas many as five thousand tons of freight at a speed of about ten\r\nknots--only a trifle less than that of an ordinary tramp freighter. Some\r\nof the larger vessels are provided with auxiliary engines and propelling\r\napparatus, which enables them to enter or to leave port without the\r\nassistance of a tug. Donkey-engines hoist and lower the sails, and\r\nperform the work of loading and unloading. They are admirable colliers\r\nand grain-carriers.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, about ninety thousand\r\nsailing-craft and thirty-five thousand steam-vessels were required to\r\ncarry the world\'s commerce. Of this number, Great Britain and her\r\ncolonies register nearly thirty-five thousand, and the United States\r\nover twenty thousand.\r\n\r\n     HARBOR SAFEGUARDS.--Excepting the open anchorages formed by angles\r\n     in coast-lines, the greater number of harbors consist of small\r\n     coves and river-mouths. In these, although there may be a\r\n     considerable area of water, there is not apt to be much sailing\r\n     room; it is therefore necessary to mark off the navigable channels.\r\n     For this purpose buoys of different shapes and colors are used by\r\n     day; by night fixed and flashing lights are employed.\r\n\r\n     The buoys of permanent channels are usually hollow metal cylinders\r\n     or cones about two feet in diameter, anchored so that the end of\r\n     the cylinder projects about three feet above the water. On entering\r\n     a channel from the seaward, red buoys are on the starboard, or\r\n     right hand; white buoys are kept on the port, or left side. Buoys\r\n     at the end of a channel are usually surmounted each by some device\r\n     or other fastened at the upper end of a perch. Thus, at the outer\r\n     entrance of Gedney Channel in New York Harbor, a ball surmounts the\r\n     perch; at the inner entrance the buoy carries a double square.\r\n     Sharp angles in a channel are similarly marked. In many instances\r\n     the buoy carries, as a warning signal, a bell that rings as the\r\n     buoy is rocked by the waves; in others, a whistle that sounds by\r\n     the air which the rocking motion compresses within the cylinder;\r\n     still others carry electric or gas lights.\r\n\r\n     The color of a buoy is an index of its character. Thus, one with\r\n     black and red stripes indicates danger; one with black and white\r\n     vertical stripes is a channel-marker. Temporary channels are\r\n     frequently marked by pieces of spar floating upright. In some cases\r\n     it is customary to set untrimmed tree-tops on the port, and trimmed\r\n     sticks on the starboard.\r\n\r\n     Light-houses are built at all exposed points of navigated\r\n     coast-waters, and beacons are set at all necessary points within a\r\n     harbor for use at night. All lights are kept burning from sunset\r\n     until sunrise. The color, the duration, and the intervals of\r\n     flashing indicate the position of the beacon. In revolving lights\r\n     the beams, concentrated by powerful lenses, sweep the horizon as\r\n     the lantern about the light revolves. Flashing lights are produced\r\n     when the light is obscured at given intervals. Fixed lights burn\r\n     with a steady flame. In some instances a sector of colored glass is\r\n     set so as to cover a given part of a channel. Range lights, set so\r\n     that one shows directly above the other, are used as\r\n     channel-markers.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: CITY OF NEW YORK AND VICINITY, WITH HARBOR\r\n     APPROACHES.]\r\n\r\n     The use of lights may be seen as a vessel enters New York Lower\r\n     Bay. A steamship drawing not more than eighteen feet of water may\r\n     enter through Swash Channel (_follow the course on the chart_). In\r\n     this case the pilot makes for Scotland lightship, and merely keeps\r\n     New Dorp and Elmtree beacons in range, giving Dry Romer a wide\r\n     berth to starboard, until Chapel Hill and Conover beacons come into\r\n     range on his port side. The vessel is then held on a course between\r\n     Coney Island and Fort Tompkins lights until Robbins Reef light\r\n     shows ahead.\r\n\r\n     For the liners that draw more than eighteen feet the task is more\r\n     difficult, inasmuch as the channel is tortuous. At Sandy Hook\r\n     lightship a course lying nearly west takes the vessel to the outer\r\n     entrance of Gedney Channel, marked by two buoy-lights. In passing\r\n     between the lights the vessel enters the channel, which is also\r\n     covered by the red sector of Hook beacon. The pilot continues\r\n     between the buoy-lights until Waacaack and Point Comfort beacons\r\n     are in range, and steers to this range until South Beacon and Sandy\r\n     Hook light are in range astern. The helm is then turned, keeping\r\n     these lights in range astern until Chapel Hill and Conover beacons\r\n     are in range on the port bow. Turning northward nearly eight\r\n     points, the pilot holds the bow of the vessel between Fort Tompkins\r\n     and Coney Island lights, keeping sharply to his range astern, until\r\n     Robbins Reef light comes into view through the narrows. From this\r\n     point on, the shore lights are the pilot\'s chief guide.\r\n\r\n     So difficult are harbor entrances, that in most cases the\r\n     underwriters will not insure a vessel unless the latter is taken\r\n     from the outer harbor to the dock by a licensed pilot, and the\r\n     latter must spend nearly half a lifetime as an apprentice before he\r\n     receives a license. The charges for pilotage are usually regulated\r\n     by the number of feet the vessel draws. The charges differ in\r\n     various ports, but the devices for marking and lighting the\r\n     channels are much the same in every part of the world. In the\r\n     United States all navigable channels are under the control of the\r\n     general Government.\r\n\r\n=Inland Waters.=--Lakes, rivers, and canals furnish a very important means\r\nof transportation. In Europe and Canada an enormous amount of slow\r\nfreight is transported by their use; in China they are the most\r\nimportant means of internal traffic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COMMERCE OF THE OHIO--TOWING COAL TO THE STEEL\r\nMILLS, PITTSBURG]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the Great Lakes with the Erie Canal and Hudson\r\nRiver form the most important internal water-way, and by them the\r\ncontinent is penetrated as far west as Duluth, a distance of more than\r\none thousand three hundred miles. The traffic passing out of Lake\r\nSuperior alone is about one-third greater than that passing out of the\r\nMediterranean Sea at the Suez Canal. Much of this traffic goes across\r\nthe continent, and the route in question is one of the great commercial\r\nhighways of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi River and its branches afford not far from ten thousand\r\nmiles of navigable waters. Canals connect tributaries of this river with\r\nthe Great Lakes at Chicago and at several points in Ohio. The\r\ndevelopment of the navigation of this great water-way was checked by the\r\nCivil War, and after the close of the war the great advance in railway\r\nbuilding kept its improvement in the background. The general government,\r\nnevertheless, has done much to encourage the use of the Mississippi as a\r\ncommercial highway, and many millions of dollars have been spent in\r\nwidening and deepening its channel.[8] On the upper river grain and\r\nlumber form the chief traffic; on the lower part a large part of the\r\nworld\'s cotton-crop starts on its journey to the various markets.\r\n\r\nOn account of the soft-coal fields and the steel manufacture in western\r\nPennsylvania, the commerce of the Ohio River is very heavy, aggregating\r\nnot far from fifteen million tons yearly. Much of this traffic extends\r\nto ports on the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe navigable parts of the Hudson and Delaware Rivers are estuaries of\r\nthe sea or "drowned valleys." In each case navigation extends about to\r\nthe limits of high tide. Both rivers carry a heavy freight commerce; the\r\nHudson has a passenger traffic of several million fares each year.\r\nNearly every river of the Atlantic coast is navigable to the limit of\r\nhigh tide or a little beyond. Navigation extends to the point where the\r\ncoast-plain joins the foot-hills. Above this limit, called the "Fall\r\nLine," the streams are swift and shallow; below it they are deep and\r\nsluggish. As a result, a chain of important river ports extends along\r\nthe Fall Line from Maine to Florida.\r\n\r\nRiver-navigation in Europe in the main is inseparably connected with the\r\ngreat canal systems. As a rule, the lower parts of the rivers are\r\nnavigable for steamboats of light draught. Some of the smaller streams\r\nare made navigable by means of a long steel chain, which is laid along\r\nthe bed of the stream; the boat engages the chain by means of heavy\r\nsprocket wheels driven by steam, and thus wind the boat up and down the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nOcean steamers penetrate the Amazon Valley to a distance of one thousand\r\nmiles from its mouth; boats of light draught ascend the main stream and\r\nsome of its tributaries a thousand miles farther. The Orinoco is\r\nnavigable within one hundred miles of Bogota. Light-draught boats ascend\r\nthe tributaries of La Plata River a distance of fifteen hundred miles.\r\n\r\nThe Asian rivers that are important highways of commerce are few in\r\nnumber. The Amur, Yangtze, Indus, and Cambodia have each considerable\r\nlocal commerce. The Hugli, a channel in the delta of the Ganges, has a\r\nchannel deep enough for ocean steamships. The tributaries of the Lena,\r\nYenisei, and Ob have been of the greatest service in the commercial\r\ndevelopment of northern Asia from the fact that their valleys are both\r\nlevel and fertile.\r\n\r\nBecause of a high interior and abrupt slopes, the rivers of Africa are\r\nnot suitable for navigation to any considerable extent; the channels are\r\nuncertain and the rivers are interrupted by rapids. The Nile has an\r\noccasional steamboat service as far as the "First Cataract," but in high\r\nwater the service is sometimes extended farther. The Kongo has a long\r\nstretch of navigable water, but is interrupted by rapids below Stanley\r\nPool. Similar conditions obtain in the Zambezi. The lower part of the\r\nSenegal affords good navigation. The Niger has in many respects greater\r\ncommercial possibilities than other rivers of Africa. It is navigable to\r\na distance of three hundred miles.\r\n\r\n=Canals.=--Canals easily rank among the most important means of traffic,\r\nas a rule, supplementing other navigable waters. Thus, by means of an\r\nelaborate system of canals, goods are transferred by water, from one\r\nriver-basin to another, so that practically all the navigable streams of\r\nwestern Europe are connected. Canals are extensively used to avoid the\r\nfalls or rapids that separate the various reaches of rivers. The water\r\nitself by means of locks lifts the boat to a higher level or transfers\r\nit to a lower reach, thus saving the expense of unloading, transferring,\r\nand reloading a cargo.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which canals supplement the obstructed navigation of a\r\nriver is seen in the case of the St. Lawrence. This river is obstructed\r\nin several places by rapids, but by means of canals steamship service\r\nconnects the Great Lakes, not only with Quebec, but with ports of the\r\nMediterranean Sea as well; indeed, it is possible to send a cargo from\r\nDuluth, at the head of Lake Superior, to Odessa or Batum, on the shores\r\nof the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nThe internal water-ways of Canada have been splendidly developed. The\r\nCanadian St. Marys Canal furnishes an outlet to Lake Superior for\r\nvessels drawing twenty-one feet. The Welland Canal connects Lakes Erie\r\nand Ontario. The Rideau Canal and River connect Kingston and Lake\r\nOntario with the Ottawa, and the latter with its canals is navigable to\r\nthe St. Lawrence. With a population of less than six millions the\r\nDominion Government has spent nearly one hundred million dollars in the\r\nimprovement of internal water-ways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROFILE OF ERIE CANAL\r\n\r\nHORIZONTAL SCALE 100 MILES TO THE INCH, VERTICAL SCALE 1,000 FEET TO THE\r\nINCH]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the possible development of canals has been\r\nneglected and, to a certain extent, stifled by railway building. The\r\nErie Canal, built before the advent of the railway, connects Lake Erie\r\nwith tide-water at Albany, a distance of 387 miles. For many years it\r\nwas the chief means of traffic between the Mississippi Valley and the\r\nAtlantic seaboard, and although paralleled by the six tracks of a great\r\nrailway system, it is still an important factor in the carriage of grain\r\nand certain classes of slow freight.[9] The level way that made the\r\ncanal possible is largely responsible for the decline of its importance,\r\nfor the absence of steep grades enables a powerful locomotive to haul\r\nso many cars that the quick transit more than overbalances a very low\r\nton rate by the canal.\r\n\r\nThe Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, designed to connect the Mississippi\r\nValley with the Atlantic seaboard, fared much worse than the Erie Canal.\r\nLess than two hundred miles have been completed, and practically no work\r\nexcept that of repair has been done since 1850; the heavy grades between\r\nCumberland and Pittsburg render its completion improbable.\r\n\r\nAn excellent system of canals, the Ohio and Erie and the Miami and Erie,\r\nconnect the Ohio River with Lake Erie. These canals are in the State of\r\nOhio and aggregate about six hundred miles in length. They are important\r\nas coal and ore carriers. Several hundred miles of canals were built\r\nalong the river-valleys of eastern Pennsylvania before 1840 for carrying\r\ncoal to tide-water. Most of them have been abandoned; one, the Delaware\r\n& Hudson Canal Co., survives as a railway. Inasmuch as the coal went on\r\na down grade from the mines to the markets, it could be carried more\r\neconomically by railway than by canal.\r\n\r\nOf far greater importance are the St. Marys Canal on the Canadian side,\r\nand the St. Marys Falls Canal on the American side, of St. Marys River.\r\nThese canals obviate the falls in St. Marys River and form the\r\ncommercial outlet of Lake Superior. The tonnage of goods, mainly iron\r\nore and coal, is about one-half greater than that of the Suez Canal.\r\nAbout twenty-five thousand vessels pass through these canals yearly.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal,[10] from Lake Michigan to Lockport,\r\non the Illinois River, was designed mainly to carry the sewage of\r\nChicago which, prior to the construction of the canal, was poured into\r\nthe lake through the Chicago River. The completion of the canal turned\r\nthe course of the river and caused the water to flow out of the lake,\r\ncarrying the city\'s sewage. It is intended to complete a navigable\r\nwater-way from Chicago to St. Louis deep enough for vessels drawing\r\nfourteen feet. Its value is therefore strategic as well as industrial,\r\nfor by means of it gun-boats may readily pass from the Gulf of Mexico to\r\nthe Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nOceanic canals are designed both for naval strategic purposes and for\r\nindustrial uses. Thus, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, from the mouth of the\r\nElbe to Kiel Bay, across the base of Jutland, saves two days between\r\nHamburg and the Baltic ports. It also enables German war-vessels to\r\nconcentrate quickly in either the North or the Baltic Sea. The\r\nManchester Ship Canal makes Manchester a seaport and saves the cost of\r\ntrans-shipping freights by rail from Liverpool. The Corinth Canal across\r\nthe isthmus that joins the Peloponnesus to the mainland of Greece\r\naffords a much shorter route between Italian ports and Odessa. The North\r\nHolland Ship Canal makes Amsterdam practically a seaport.\r\n\r\nProbably no other highway of commerce since the discovery of the Cape\r\nroute around Africa has caused such a great change and readjustment of\r\ntrade between Europe and Asia as the Suez Canal. Sailing-vessels still\r\ntake the Cape route, because the heavy towage tolls through the canal\r\nmore than offset the gain in time. Steamships have their own power and\r\ngenerally take the canal route, thereby saving about ten days in time\r\nand fuel, and about four thousand eight hundred miles in distance. In\r\nspite of the heavy tolls the saving is considerable. About three\r\nthousand five hundred vessels pass through the canal yearly.\r\n\r\nThe Suez Canal, constructed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, for some time was\r\nunder the control of French capitalists. Subsequently, by the purchase\r\nof stock partly in open market and partly from the Khedive of Egypt, the\r\ncontrol of the canal passed into the hands of the English. The\r\nrestrictions placed upon the passage of war-ships is such that the canal\r\nwould be of little use to nations at war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROUTE OF THE PANAMA CANAL]\r\n\r\nThe necessity of an interoceanic canal across the American continent has\r\nbecome more imperative year by year for fifty years. The discovery of\r\ngold in California caused an emigration from the Atlantic to the Pacific\r\ncoast which resulted in a permanent settlement of the latter region. A\r\nrailway across the Isthmus of Panama and another across the Isthmus of\r\nTehuantepec have afforded very poor means of communication between\r\noceans.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 work on a tide-level canal across the Isthmus of Panama was\r\nbegun, but the plan was afterward changed to a high-level canal. The\r\nchange was thought necessary partly on account of the great cost of the\r\nformer, and partly because of the difficulties of constructing so deep a\r\ncut--about three hundred and forty feet--at the summit of the Culebra\r\nridge. The construction company, after spending the entire\r\ncapital--about one hundred and twenty million dollars--in accomplishing\r\none-tenth of the work, became bankrupt. The United States subsequently\r\npurchased the franchise.\r\n\r\nA canal by way of Lake Nicaragua has also been projected, and two\r\ntreaties with Great Britain, whereby the United States agreed to build\r\nno fortifications to guard it, have been made. No work beyond the\r\nsurveys has yet been undertaken, however. The cost of each canal is\r\nestimated between one hundred and fifty million and two hundred million\r\ndollars. The Panama route will require about twelve hours for the\r\npassage of a vessel; the Nicaragua route about sixty hours.[11] (_See\r\nmap, p. 270._)\r\n\r\nThe completion of a canal by either route will cause a readjustment of\r\nthe world\'s commerce far greater than that which followed the\r\nconstruction of the Suez Canal. By such a route San Francisco is brought\r\nnearer to London than Calcutta now is, and the all-water route between\r\nthe Atlantic ports of the United States and those of China and Japan\r\nwill be shortened by upward of eight thousand miles. The importance of\r\nthe Hawaiian Islands, already a great ocean depot, will be greatly\r\nincreased, and the latter is becoming one of the great commercial\r\nstations of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat were some of the effects which resulted from the various embargo\r\nand non-intercourse acts that preceded the war of 1812?\r\n\r\nWhat is the effect upon an industry when all means of getting the\r\nproducts to market are cut off?\r\n\r\nIn the early history of the country rivers were the most important\r\nhighways of commerce; obtain an account of some instance of this in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nCertain commodities have been carried about four-fifths of the distance\r\nbetween Moscow and Vladivostok by water, across Siberia.

This is due in part to the saving of time\r\nin transit--for under the demands of modern business, the only economy\r\nis economy of time--and in part to prompt delivery at the specified\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nInto a large centre of population like New York, London, or Berlin, many\r\nmillions of pounds of perishable food-stuffs must be brought daily for\r\nconsumption. Now these food-stuffs must be delivered with promptness,\r\nand no delay can be tolerated. A shipper having half a million pounds of\r\nmeat or a hundred thousand pounds of flour or a car-load of fruit to\r\ndeliver can take no risks; he sends it by rail, not only because it is\r\nthe quickest way, but because experience has shown it to be the most\r\nprompt way; as a rule, it is delivered on the exact minute of schedule\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nCargoes of silks and teas from China and Japan might be sent all the way\r\nto London by water, but experience has shown a more profitable way. The\r\nconsignments are sent by swift steamships to Seattle; thence by fast\r\nexpress trains to New York; there they are transferred to swift liners\r\nthat take them across the Atlantic to European ports. And although this\r\nmethod of shipment is enormously expensive as compared with the\r\nall-water route, the saving of time and certainty of prompt delivery\r\nmore than offset the extra cost of delivery.\r\n\r\nIn the last half of the nineteenth century the cost of haulage in the\r\nUnited States by rail decreased so materially that in a few instances\r\nonly--notably the Great Lakes and the Hudson River--do inland waters\r\ncompete with the railways.[12] This is due in part to better\r\norganization of the railways, but mainly to the substitution of Bessemer\r\nsteel for iron rails and the great improvements in locomotives and\r\nrolling stock.\r\n\r\nThe use of a steam-driven locomotive became possible for the first time\r\nwhen Stephenson used the tubular boiler and the forced draught,[13]\r\nthereby making steam rapidly enough for a short, quick stroke. In 1865 a\r\ngood freight locomotive weighing thirty tons could haul about forty\r\nbox-cars, each loaded with ten tons. This was the maximum load for a\r\nlevel track; the average load for a single locomotive was about\r\ntwenty-five or thirty cars. Heavier locomotives could not well be used\r\nbecause the iron rails went to pieces under them.\r\n\r\nThe invention of Bessemer steel produced a rail that was safe under the\r\npounding of a locomotive three or four times as heavy as those formerly\r\nemployed; it produced boilers that would carry steam at 250 instead of\r\n60 pounds pressure per square inch. As a result, with only a moderate\r\nincrease in the fuel burned, a single locomotive on a level track will\r\nhaul eighty or ninety box-cars, each carrying nearly seventy thousand\r\npounds.[14]\r\n\r\nThe application of the double and the triple expansion principle has\r\nbeen quite as successful with locomotive as with marine engines in\r\nsaving fuel and gaining power--that is, it has decreased the cost per\r\nton-mile of hauling freight and likewise the cost of transporting\r\npassengers. Enlarged "fire-boxes," or furnaces,[15] enable steam to be\r\nmade more rapidly and to give higher speed.[16] Only a few years ago\r\nforty-eight hours was the scheduled time between New York and Chicago;\r\nnow there are about forty trains a day between these two cities, several\r\nof which make the trip in twenty-four hours or less.\r\n\r\n=Railway Development.=--The railway as a common carrier, having its right\r\nby virtue of a government charter, dates from 1801, when a tramway was\r\nbuilt between Croydon and Wandsworth, two suburbs of London. The rails\r\nwere iron straps, nailed to wooden stringers. The charter was carefully\r\ndrawn in order to prevent the road from competing with omnibus lines and\r\npublic cabs.\r\n\r\nWhen the steam locomotive succeeded horse-power, however, there\r\nfollowed an era of railway development that in a few years\r\nrevolutionized the carrying trade in the thickly settled parts of the\r\nUnited States and Europe. Short, independent lines were constructed\r\nwithout any reference whatever to the natural movement of traffic. There\r\nseemed but one idea, namely, to connect two cities or towns. Indeed, the\r\nabsence of a definite plan was much similar to that of the interurban\r\nelectric roads a century later; local traffic was the only\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nAt first an opinion prevailed that the road-bed of the railway ought to\r\nbe a public highway upon which any individual or company might run its\r\nown conveyances, on the payment of a fixed toll; indeed, in both Europe\r\nand the United States, public opinion could see no difference between\r\nthe railway and the canal. The employment of a steam-driven locomotive\r\nengine, however, made such a plan impossible, and demonstrated that the\r\nroads must be thoroughly organized.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1850 there were nearly four hundred different railway\r\ncompanies in England; in the United States about a dozen companies were\r\nrequired to make the connection of New York City and Buffalo. A few of\r\nthese paid dividends; a large majority barely met their operating\r\nexpenses, defaulting the interest on their bonds; a great many were\r\nhopelessly bankrupt.\r\n\r\n=Consolidation of Connecting Lines.=--Between 1850 and 1865 a new feature\r\nentered into railway management, namely, the union of connecting lines.\r\nThis was a positive advantage, for the operating expenses of the sixteen\r\nlines, now a part of the New York Central, between New York and Buffalo\r\nwere scarcely greater than the expenses of one-third that number. The\r\nservice was much quicker, better, and cheaper. In England the several\r\nhundred companies were reduced to twelve; in France the thirty-five or\r\nmore companies were reduced to six in number.\r\n\r\nThe consolidation of connecting lines brought about another desirable\r\nfeature--the extension of the existing lines.[17] The lines of\r\ncontinental Europe were extended eastward to the Russian frontier, and\r\nto Constantinople; then the Alps were surmounted. In the United States\r\nrailway extension was equally great. The Union and Central Pacific\r\nrailways were opened in 1869, giving the first all-rail route to the\r\nPacific coast. Other routes to the Pacific followed within a few years,\r\none of which, the Canadian Pacific, was built from Quebec to Vancouver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TRUNK SYSTEM--THE VARIOUS BRANCHES EXTEND INTO COAL,\r\nGRAIN, IRON, CATTLE, TIMBER, AND TOBACCO REGIONS]\r\n\r\nThe period from 1864 was one of extensive railway building both in the\r\nUnited States and Europe. Some of the roads, such as the transalpine\r\nrailways of Europe and the Pacific roads of the United States, were\r\ngreatly needed. Others that created new fields of industry by opening to\r\ncommunication productive lands were also wise and necessary; the lands\r\nwould have been valueless without them. Not a few lines that were to be\r\nneeded in time were built so far ahead of time that they did not even\r\npay their operating expenses for many years.\r\n\r\nAnother class of roads was intended for speculative purposes. Thus,\r\nthere were instances in which a line occupying a given territory had\r\nantagonized its patrons by poor service, and extortionate charges.\r\nThereupon another company would obtain a charter--which was then easily\r\ndone--and build a competing line in the same territory, the former most\r\nlikely having scarcely enough business for one road.[18] The results\r\nwere almost always the same; a war of rate-cutting followed; the\r\nstockholders of both roads lost heavily; and one or both went into the\r\nhands of receivers.\r\n\r\n=Competition and Pools.=--In many instances the consolidation of roads,\r\nwhile cutting off disastrous competition in the territory jointly\r\noccupied by the two roads, brought the consolidated road into fierce\r\ncompetition with another adjacent system. If the roads had practically\r\nthe same territory but different terminals the competition was confined\r\nmainly to local traffic. On the other hand, they might have the same\r\nterminals but cover different local territories; in this case the roads\r\nmust compete for through traffic. Thus the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy\r\nis brought into competition with the Union Pacific in Nebraska, but\r\ninasmuch as the roads have different and widely distant terminals, their\r\nlocal traffic is easily adjusted. The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy and\r\nthe Northwestern have common terminals at Chicago, St. Paul, Denver,\r\nOmaha, and Kansas City. They must therefore compete with each other, and\r\nwith half-a-dozen other roads for their through traffic.\r\n\r\nCompetition between railways differs greatly from that between two\r\nfirms. If one of two firms cannot afford to compete, the manager may\r\ndischarge his help, and close doors; he then does not suffer actual\r\nloss. But a railway, being a common carrier, cannot do this; the road\r\nmust keep its trains moving or lose its charter. If it cannot carry\r\ngoods at a profit it must carry them at cost or at a loss. Even the\r\nlatter is better than not carrying them at all, for the operating\r\nexpenses of the road must go on.\r\n\r\nSo between 1870 and 1880 most of the railway managements were busy\r\ndevising ways to stop a rate-cutting and competition that was ruinous.\r\nIn many instances great trunk lines would have consolidated had not\r\nState laws prevented. They could not maintain rates because one or\r\nanother of the weaker roads would be compelled to lower their rates in\r\norder to meet their operating expenses. Therefore they were compelled to\r\ndo one of three things, namely, to divide the territory, to divide\r\ntraffic, or to divide earnings. Either of the two latter plans is called\r\na _pool_.\r\n\r\nOf these two forms of pooling the division of the traffic is the easier,\r\nbut it is often unsatisfactory to the patrons of the road. The second\r\nplan, the division of the earnings, is a more difficult matter to adjust\r\nbecause each road is usually dissatisfied with its proportion. As a\r\nmatter of fact, however, the first plan of pooling is very apt to grow\r\ninto the second.\r\n\r\nIn several instances pools have been declared illegal by the courts,\r\nbut, in general, railway service has been more satisfactory under the\r\npool system than under any other. They have always aroused popular\r\nsuspicion, however, from the fact that they increase power of the\r\nrailway itself. In various instances important trunk lines have formed a\r\ngeneral company, each having its separate organization, because they\r\ncould accomplish under a combined organization what they could not as\r\nindependent companies. The restrictions against pooling have therefore\r\nencouraged combination of competing lines.\r\n\r\nBecause the railway is an absolute necessity, and because it has power\r\ngiven neither to individuals nor to other corporations, it is a settled\r\npolicy that both the State and general Government should have the power\r\nto regulate its rates, and should in every way prevent unjust\r\ndiscrimination. Both problems are very difficult, however, and the\r\nunintelligent adjustment of rates has frequently resulted in injustice\r\nboth to the roads and their patrons.\r\n\r\nA rate per ton-mile for each class of freight is out of question,\r\nbecause a large part of the cost to the company consists in loading,\r\nhandling, and storing the goods. Once aboard the car, it costs but\r\nlittle more to carry a ton of freight one hundred miles than to move it\r\none mile. The rates per mile, therefore, are necessarily greater for\r\nshort distances than for long runs. A mile-rate based on a ten-mile haul\r\nwould be prohibitive to the shipper if applied to a run between Chicago\r\nand New York. On the other hand, were the charges based on the long run,\r\nthe local rates would be far less than the cost of the service.[19]\r\n\r\nAs a result freight rates are based very largely on the cost of the\r\nservice, and this is particularly true of local freights. This practice\r\nis also modified by charging _what the traffic will bear_, and, on the\r\nwhole, a combination of the two ideas gives the most reasonable and the\r\nfairest method of basing charges. Thus, a car filled with fine, crated\r\nfurniture, which is light and bulky, can afford a higher rate than one\r\nfilled with scrap-iron. Cars filled with grain, lumber, coal, or ore are\r\nmade up in train-loads, and form a part of the daily haul; they can\r\nafford to be taken at a lower rate than the stuffs of which only an\r\noccasional car-load is hauled. In order to adjust this problem it is\r\ncustomary to divide freights into six general classes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PROBLEM OF FREIGHT RATES]\r\n\r\nIn handling through freights the problems are many, and, if two or more\r\nroads have the same terminal points, a great deal of friction of\r\nnecessity results. The longest roads must either make their through\r\nrates lower than local rates between distant points, or lose much of\r\ntheir through business. They cannot afford to do the latter and the\r\nstatutory laws may forbid the former. As a result the laws most likely\r\nare evaded, or else openly disobeyed.[20]\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in adjusting the matter of the long and the short\r\nhaul, as has been shown, have caused the formation of pools and various\r\nother traffic associations, the object of which has been to prevent\r\nrate-wars. To this extent they resulted in positive good, for a\r\nrate-war in the end is apt to be as hurtful to the community as to the\r\nrailway company. The attempt to settle such questions has also resulted\r\nin a great deal of legislation. Some of this has been wise and good; but\r\nnot a little has been hurtful both to the railroads and to the\r\ncommunity. The general result is seen in the great combination of\r\ncompeting lines and, more recently, of competing systems.\r\n\r\n=Passenger Service.=--Passenger traffic is more easily managed than the\r\nmovement of freight. For the greater part the rates are fixed by law. On\r\na few eastern roads local rates are two cents per mile; in the main,\r\nhowever, a three-cent rate prevails, except that in sparsely peopled\r\nregions the rates are four and five cents per mile. On many roads\r\n1,000-mile books are sold at the rate of twenty dollars; on some the\r\nrate is twenty-five dollars per book.\r\n\r\nLong-distance rates involving passage over several roads are somewhat\r\nless than the local rates. These rates are determined by joint\r\npassenger-tariff associations. Each individual road fixes its own\r\nexcursion and commutation rates; one or another of the joint passenger\r\nassociations determines the rates where several roads divide the\r\ntraffic. The latter are usually one, or one and one-third fares for the\r\nround trip.\r\n\r\nExcept on a few local roads in densely peopled regions the passenger\r\nservice is much less remunerative than freight business, and not a few\r\nrailways would abolish passenger trains altogether were they permitted\r\nto do so. Rate-cutting between competing roads has not been common since\r\nthe existence of joint passenger associations. It is sometimes done\r\nsecretly, however, through the use of ticket-brokers, or "scalpers," who\r\nare employed to sell tickets at less than the usual rate; it is also\r\ndone by the illicit use of tickets authorized for given purposes, such\r\nas "editors\'," "clergymen\'s," and "advertising" transportation.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, where several roads have the same terminal points, it\r\nis customary for the road or roads having the quickest service to allow\r\na lower rate to the others. Thus, of the seven or eight roads between\r\nNew York and Chicago, the two best equipped roads charge a fare of\r\ntwenty dollars on their ordinary, and a higher rate on their limited,\r\ntrains. Because of slower time the other roads charge a sum less by two\r\nor three dollars for the same service. This cut in the rate is called a\r\n"differential."\r\n\r\n=Railway Mileage.=--The railways of the world in 1900 had an aggregate of\r\nnearly four hundred and eighty thousand miles distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  North America                   216,000\r\n  Europe                          173,000\r\n  Asia                             36,000\r\n  South America and West Indies    28,000\r\n  Australasia                      15,000\r\n  Africa                           12,000\r\n\r\nIn western Europe and the eastern United States there is an average of\r\none mile of railway to each six or eight square miles of area. In these\r\ncountries railway construction has reached probably its highest\r\ndevelopment, and the proportion seems to represent the mileage necessary\r\nfor the commercial interests of the people.\r\n\r\nThe railways of the United States aggregate 193,000 miles--nearly\r\none-half the total mileage of the world. Over this enormous trackage\r\n38,000 locomotives and 1,400,000 coaches and cars carry yearly\r\n600,000,000 passengers and 1,000,000,000 tons of freight. They represent\r\nan outlay of about $5,000,000,000. Owing to the absence of the\r\ninternational problems that have greatly interfered with the\r\norganization of European railways, the roads of the United States have\r\ndeveloped "trunk-system" features to a higher degree than is found\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the United States and Canada the farms of the great central plain,\r\ntogether with the coal-mines, are the great centres of production, while\r\nthe seaports of the two coasts form great centres of distribution. Most\r\nof the trunk lines, therefore, extend east and west; of the north and\r\nsouth lines only two are important. The reason for the east-west\r\ndirection of the great trunk lines is obvious; the great markets of\r\nNorth America, Europe, and Asia lie respectively to the east and the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RAILWAYS OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nTHEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE PRODUCTION OF THE LAND]\r\n\r\n=Railway Ownership.=--The ownership of railways is vested either in\r\nnational governments or else in corporate companies; in only a few\r\ninstances are roads held individually by private owners, and these are\r\nmainly lumber or plantation roads. Thus, the railways of Prussia are\r\nowned by the state; most of those of the smaller German states are owned\r\neither by the state or by the empire; still others are owned by\r\ncorporate companies and managed by the imperial government. In their\r\nmanagement military use is considered as first in importance.\r\n\r\nIn France governmental ownership and management have been less\r\nsuccessful. Plans for an elaborate system of state railways failed, and\r\nthe state now owns and operates only 1,700 miles, mainly, in the\r\nsouthwest. Belgium controls and operates all her lines, but as the\r\nlatter are short and the area of the state small, there are no\r\ndifficulties in the way of excellent management. In Great Britain all\r\nthe railways are owned and controlled by corporate companies. The great\r\ntranscontinental line of the Russian Empire was built by the government,\r\nbut the latter does not own it.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the railways are now owned by corporate companies.\r\nSome of the western roads were built by Government subsidies;[21] other\r\nroads were built by the aid of States, counties, or cities, which\r\nafterward sold them to corporate companies. The first transcontinental\r\nrailways required Government assistance, and could not have been built\r\nwithout it; nowadays, however, corporate companies find no difficulty in\r\nproviding the capital for any railway that is needed.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the railway is a positive necessity, upon whose existence\r\ndepends the transportation of the food daily required in the great\r\ncentres of population, the charter of the railway gives the company\r\nextraordinary powers. Most steam railway companies are permitted by the\r\nState to exercise the power of _eminent domain_--that is, they may seize\r\nand hold the land on which to locate their tracks and buildings, if it\r\ncannot be acquired by the consent of the owners; they may also seize\r\ncoal and other materials consigned to them for shipment if such\r\nmaterials are necessary to operate their lines.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in consideration of the unusual powers possessed by the\r\ncompanies, the various States reserve the right to regulate the freight\r\nand passenger tariffs. They may also compel the companies to afford\r\nequal facilities to all patrons, and take the measures necessary to\r\nprevent discrimination.\r\n\r\nThe control of the railways by the government may be absolute, as in the\r\nGerman state of Prussia; or it may consist of a general supervision, as\r\nin the case of the Canadian railways. In almost every European state\r\nthere is a director or else a commission to act as a representative\r\nbetween the railways and the people. In the United States the various\r\nStates have each a railway commission, while the general Government is\r\nrepresented by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\r\n\r\n=Electric Railways.=--The use of electricity as a motive power has not\r\nonly revolutionized suburban traffic but it has become a great factor in\r\nrural transportation as well. The speed of the horse-car rarely exceeded\r\nfive or six miles per hour, while that of the electric car is about ten\r\nmiles per hour in city streets and about twice as great over rural\r\nroads. As a result, the suburban limits of the large centres of\r\npopulation have greatly extended, and the population of the outlying\r\ndistricts has been increased from four to ten fold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRIC RAILWAY--ROCKY MOUNTAINS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRIC FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVE--ERIE RAILROAD]\r\n\r\nFrom some of the larger cities the electric roads reach out to\r\ndistances of one hundred miles or more and have become the carriers of\r\nperishable freight, such as fruit and dairy products. These are not only\r\ndelivered just as promptly as though they were sent over the steam\r\nroads, but the delivery is more frequent. Indeed, the marvellous success\r\nof the electric interurban railway is due mainly to the frequency of its\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n=Public Roads and Highways.=--Carriages propelled by steam, electric, and\r\ngasoline motors have become an important factor in the delivery of goods\r\nin nearly every city of Europe and America. They are not only speedier\r\nthan the horse and wagon, but their keeping costs less. They are\r\neconomical only on good roads. The bicycle, no longer a plaything,\r\nexerted a very decided effect on transportation when the "pneumatic" or\r\ninflated rubber tire came into use. Through the bicycle came the demand\r\nfor good roads; and several thousand miles of the best surfaced roads\r\nare built in the United States each year.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary highways or roads, the paved streets of the large cities\r\nexcepted, are popularly known either as "dirt" roads or "macadamized"\r\nroads, the latter name being applied to about every sort of graded\r\nhighway that has been surfaced with broken rock. Most of the roads of\r\nwestern Europe are of this character. They are laid out with easy\r\ngrades, and a thick foundation of heavy stone is covered with smaller\r\npieces of broken rock, the whole being finished off with a top-dressing\r\nof fine material. Once built, the expense of keeping them in good order\r\nis less than that of keeping a dirt road in bad order.\r\n\r\nMost of the country highways of the United States are dirt roads that\r\nare deep with dust in dry weather and almost impassable at the breaking\r\nof winter. Roads of this character are such a detriment that grain\r\nfarming will not pay when the farm is distant twenty miles or more from\r\nthe nearest railway. Many a farmer pays more to haul his grain to the\r\nnearest railway station than from the railway station to London.\r\n\r\nSince it has become apparent that the commercial development of many\r\nagricultural regions depends quite as much on good wagon roads as upon\r\nrailways and expensive farming machinery, there has been a disposition\r\nto grade and rock-surface all roads that are important highways.\r\nIntercommunication becomes vastly easier; the cost of transportation is\r\nlessened by more than one-half; and the wear and destruction of vehicles\r\nis reduced to a minimum. In every case the improvement of the road is\r\ndesigned to increase traffic by making a given power do more work in\r\nless time.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat have been the effects of Bessemer steel on the carrying power of\r\nrailways?--on cheapening freight rates?\r\n\r\nWhat would be some of the effects first apparent were a large city like\r\nLondon or New York suddenly cut off from railway communication?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by a tubular boiler?--by a forced draught?--by a\r\nswitch?--by an automatic coupler?\r\n\r\nAscertain from a railway official the various danger-signals as\r\nindicated by lights, flags, and whistle-blasts.\r\n\r\nWhy should not crated furniture and coal have the same freight rate?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by a pool?--by long haul and short haul?--by rebate?\r\n\r\nIf the rate on a given weight of merchandise is one dollar and fifty\r\ncents for five miles, should it be three hundred dollars for one\r\nthousand miles?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nHartley\'s Railroad Transportation.\r\n\r\nAmerican Railways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF VEGETATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFACTORS IN THE LOCATION OF CITIES AND TOWNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population of the world is very unevenly distributed. Not far from\r\nnine-tenths live in lowland plains, below an altitude of 1,200 feet, in\r\nregions where food-stuffs grow. The remainder live mainly in the\r\ngrass-producing regions of the great plateaus, the mining regions or the\r\nflood-plains and grassy slopes of the higher montane regions.\r\n\r\n=Communal Life.=--In each of these regions, also, there is a very unequal\r\nmassing of population. In part, the various families live isolated from\r\none another; in part, they gather into cities and villages. In other\r\nwords the population of a habitable region may be classed as _rural_ and\r\n_urban_. In the United States and western Europe, agricultural pursuits\r\nencourage rural life, each family living on its own estate. In Russia,\r\nthe agricultural population usually cluster in villages.\r\n\r\nThe farmer or freeholder who owns or controls his estate, exemplifies\r\nthe most advanced condition of personal and political liberty. Only a\r\nfew centuries have elapsed since not only the land but also the life of\r\na subject was the property of the king or the feudal lord, and in those\r\ndays about the only people living in isolation were outlaws. In most\r\ncases the communal system, best exemplified in Russia, marks an\r\nintermediate stage between a low and a high state of civilization; in\r\nother instances it is necessary in order to insure safety. German\r\nfarmers in Siberia usually adopt the village plan for this reason.\r\n\r\nFor the greater part, the non-agricultural population of the civilized\r\nworld is massed in villages and cities for reasons that have nothing to\r\ndo with either civilization or self-defence. The causes that bring about\r\nthe massing of urban population are many and their operation is complex.\r\nIn general, however, it is to facilitate one or more of several things,\r\nnamely--the receiving, distribution, and transportation of commodities,\r\nthe manufacture of products, the existence of good harbors, and the\r\nexistence of minerals and metals necessary in the various industries.\r\n\r\n=The Beginnings of Towns and Cities.=--The "country town" of agricultural\r\nregions in many ways is the best type of the centre of population\r\nengaged in receiving and disbursing commodities. The farmers living in\r\ntheir vicinity send their crops to it for transportation or final\r\ndisposition. The country store is a sort of clearing-house, exchanging\r\nhousehold and other commodities, such as sugar, tea, coffee, spices,\r\ndrugs, silks, woollens, cotton goods, farming machinery, and furniture\r\nfor farm products. A railway station, grain elevator, and one or more\r\nbanks form the rest of its business equipment.\r\n\r\nUsually the town has resulted from a position of easy access. It may be\r\nthe crossing of two highways, a good landing-place on a river, the\r\nexistence of a fording-place, a bridge, a ferry, a toll gate, or a point\r\nthat formed a convenient resting-place for a day\'s journey. The towns\r\nand villages along the "buffalo" roads are examples almost without\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThe "siding" or track where freight cars may be held for unloading, has\r\nformed the beginning of many a town. The siding was located at the\r\nconvenience of the railway company; the village resulting could have\r\ngrown equally well almost anywhere else along the line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EFFECT OF POSITION--BUFFALO IS AT THE FOOT OF LAKE\r\nERIE AND THE HEAD OF ERIE CANAL; AN EXCELLENT HARBOR FACILITATES ITS\r\nCOMMERCE]\r\n\r\nIn the early history of nearly every country, military posts formed the\r\nbeginnings of many centres that have grown to be large cities. Thus,\r\nRome, Paris, London, the various "chesters"[22] of England, Milan,\r\nTurin, Paris, Chicago, Pittsburg, and Albany were established first as\r\nmilitary outposts. The trading post was most conveniently established\r\nunder the protection of the military camp, and the subsequent growth\r\ndepended partly on an accessible position, and partly on the\r\nintelligence of the men who controlled the trade of the surrounding\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n=Harbors as Factors in the Growth of Cities.=--A good harbor draws trade\r\nfrom a great distance. Thus, with a rate of 14-1/2 cents on a bushel of\r\nwheat from Chicago, New York City draws a trade from a region having a\r\nradius of more than one thousand miles. In its trade with Chinese ports,\r\nSeattle, the chief port of Puget Sound, reaches as far eastward as\r\nLondon and Hamburg.\r\n\r\n=Water-Power as a Factor.=--The presence of water-power has brought about\r\nthe establishment of many centres that have grown into populous cities.\r\nThe water-power of the New England plateau had much to do with the rapid\r\ngrowth of the New England States. At the time of the various embargo and\r\nnon-intercourse acts preceding the war of 1812, a great amount of\r\ncapital was thrown into idleness. The water-power was made available\r\nbecause, during this time, the people were compelled to manufacture for\r\nthemselves the commodities that before had been imported.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing industry at first was prosecuted in the southern\r\nAppalachians as well as in the New England plateau. It survived in the\r\nlatter, partly because of the capital available, and partly owing to the\r\nbusiness experience of the people. In the meantime villages sprang up in\r\npretty nearly every locality in which there was available water-power.\r\n\r\nSince the use of coal and the advent of cheap railway transportation,\r\nsteam has largely supplanted water-power, unless the latter is unlimited\r\nin supply. As a result, there is a marked growth of the smaller centres\r\nof population along the various water-fronts. In such cases the\r\nadvantages of a water-front offset the loss of water-power.\r\n\r\n=The Effects of Metals on the Growth of Cities.=--The character of the\r\nindustry of a region has much to do with the character of its\r\nmanufactures. Thus, coal is absolutely essential to the manufacture of\r\niron and steel; and, inasmuch as from two to eight tons of the former\r\nare necessary to manufacture a ton of steel, it is cheaper to ship the\r\nore to a place to which coal can be cheaply brought.\r\n\r\nThe coal-fields are responsible for the greater part of Pittsburg\'s\r\npopulation, and almost wholly for that of Scranton, Wilkesbarre, and\r\nmany other Pennsylvania towns. Iron and coal are responsible, also, for\r\nmany cities and towns in the vicinity of the Great Lakes. Birmingham,\r\nSalford, and Cardiff in Great Britain, Dortmund and Essen in Germany,\r\nand St. \xc3\x89tienne in France have resulted from the presence of coal and\r\niron.\r\n\r\nIn many instances man is a great factor in the establishment of a centre\r\nof population. Chicago would have been quite as well off in two or three\r\nother locations; its present location is the result of man\'s energy and\r\nis not likely to be changed. St. Louis might have been built at a dozen\r\ndifferent places and would have fared just as well; the same is true of\r\nSt. Paul, or of Indianapolis.\r\n\r\nLeavenworth at one time was a more promising city than Kansas City, but\r\nthe building of an iron bridge over the Missouri River at the latter\r\nplace gave it a start, and wide-awake men kept it in the lead. It has\r\ngrown at the expense of Leavenworth and St. Joseph, neither one of which\r\nhas become a commercial centre. Cairo, at the junction of the\r\nMississippi and Ohio Rivers, has the geographical position for a great\r\ncity; it waits for the man who can concentrate the commerce there.\r\n\r\n=Adjustment to Environment.=--San Francisco was wisely located at first,\r\nbut its grain trade was more economically carried on at Karquinez\r\nStrait, while its oriental trade is gradually concentrating at Seattle.\r\nPhiladelphia lost its commercial supremacy when the completion of the\r\nErie Canal gave return cargoes to foreign vessels discharging at New\r\nYork City. Oswego, N.Y., had the advantage of both harbor facilities and\r\nwater-power, but Syracuse, with practically no advantages except those\r\nof leadership, has far outstripped it.\r\n\r\nSuch instances of the readjustment of centres of population have been\r\ncommon in the past; they will also occur in the future. In nearly every\r\ncase the readjustment results from economic causes, the opening of new\r\nlines of transportation, the lowering of the cost of the production of a\r\ncommodity, the discovery of new economic processes--all these cause a\r\ndisturbance of population, and the latter must readjust itself to new\r\nand changed conditions.\r\n\r\nNot all peoples have the necessary intelligence and training at first to\r\nadapt themselves to their environment. For the greater part, the\r\nAmerican Indians were unable to take advantage of the wonderful\r\nresources of the continent in which they lived. The Boers occupied about\r\nthe richest part of Africa, but made no use of the natural wealth of the\r\ncountry beyond the grazing industry; in fact, their nomadic life reduced\r\nthem to a plane of civilization materially lower than that of their\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nPeople of the highest state of civilization do not always adjust\r\nthemselves to their environment readily. The people of the New England\r\nplateau were nearly a century in learning that they possessed nearly all\r\nthe best harbors of the Atlantic coast of North America. When, however,\r\nthe great commerce of the country had been wiped out of existence, it\r\ndid not take them long to readjust themselves to the industry of\r\nmanufacture, the water-power being the natural resource that made the\r\nindustry profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWere the middle Atlantic coast of the United States to undergo an\r\nelevation of 100 feet, what would be the effect on New York City?\r\n\r\nFind the factors that led to the settlement of the city or town in which\r\nor near which you live. What caused the settlement of the three or four\r\nlargest towns in the same county?--of the following places: Minneapolis,\r\nFall River, New Haven, New Bedford, Cairo (Ill.), Cairo (Egypt),\r\nMarseille, Aix-la-Chapelle, Alexandria (Egypt), Washington (D.C.),\r\nColumbus (O.), Johannesburg (Africa), Kimberley (Africa), Albany (N.Y.),\r\nPunta Arenas (S.A.), Scranton (Pa.), Vancouver (B.C.), San Francisco,\r\nCape Nome?\r\n\r\nWhat circumstances connected with commerce led to the passing of the\r\nfollowing-named places: Palmyra, Carthage, Babylon, Genoa, Venice,\r\nAncient Rome, Jerusalem?\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLATERAL REFERENCE\r\n\r\nAny good cyclop\xc3\xa6dia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE CEREALS AND GRASSES\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the plants connected with the economies of mankind the grasses\r\nhold easily the first place. Not only are the seeds of certain species\r\nthe chief food of nearly all peoples, but the plants themselves are the\r\nfood of most animals whose flesh is used as meat. Wheat, maize, and rice\r\nare used by all except a very few peoples; and about all the animals\r\nused for food, fish and mollusks excepted, are grain eaters, or grass\r\neaters, or both.\r\n\r\nThe grasses of the Plains in Texas, the Veldt in South Africa, and the\r\nhills of New Zealand by nature\'s processes are converted into meat that\r\nfeeds the great cities of western Europe and the eastern United States.\r\nThe corn of the Mississippi valley becomes the pork which, yielded from\r\nthe carcasses of more than forty million swine, is exported to half the\r\ncountries of the world. Even the two and one-half billion pounds of wool\r\nconsumed yearly is converted grass.\r\n\r\n=Wheat.=--The wheat of commerce is the seed of several species of cereal\r\ngrass, one of which, _Triticum sativum_, is the ordinary cultivated\r\nplant. Wild species are found in the highlands of Kurdistan, in Greece,\r\nand in Mesopotamia, that are identical with species cultivated to-day.\r\nIt is thought that the cultivation of the grain began in Mesopotamia,\r\nbut it is also certain that it was grown by the Swiss lake-dwellers far\r\nback in prehistoric times. It is the "corn" Joseph\'s brothers sought to\r\nbuy when they went to Egypt, and the records of its harvesting are\r\nscattered all over the pages of written history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAIN CROP--MODERN METHODS OF CULTIVATION AND\r\nHARVESTING]\r\n\r\nOf the one and one-half billion people that constitute the world\'s\r\npopulation, more than one-third, or about eight times the population of\r\nthe United States, are consumers of wheat-bread; and this number is\r\nyearly increasing by twelve million. Moreover, each individual of this\r\naggregate consumes yearly very nearly one barrel of flour, or about four\r\nand one-half bushels of wheat. In other words, it requires somewhat more\r\nthan two billion three hundred million bushels of wheat each year to\r\nsupply the world\'s demand.[23] As a matter of fact the world\'s crop is\r\nyearly consumed so nearly to the danger-line that very often the\r\n"visible supply," or the amount known to be in the market, is reduced to\r\na few million bushels.\r\n\r\nWheat will grow under very wide ranges of climate, but it thrives best\r\nbetween the parallels of 25\xc2\xb0 and 55\xc2\xb0. In a soil very rich in vegetable\r\nmould it is apt to "run to stalk." A rather poor clay-loam produces the\r\nbest seed,[24] and a hard seed, rather than a heavy stalk, is required.\r\n\r\nIn the latitude of Kansas the seeds planted in the fall will retain\r\ntheir vitality through the winter; in the latitude of Dakota they are\r\n"winter-killed," as a rule. Because of this feature two broad classes or\r\ndivisions of the crop are recognized in commerce--the winter and the\r\nspring varieties. In general, the spring wheats are regarded as the\r\nbetter, and this is nearly always the case in localities too cold for\r\nwinter wheat. There are exceptions to this rule, however. In the main,\r\nwinter wheat ripens first, and is therefore first in the market.[25]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEAT]\r\n\r\nIn Europe the plain that faces the North and Baltic Seas, and that part\r\nwhich extends through southern Russia, yield the chief part of the\r\ncrop, although the plains of the Po, the Danube, and Bohemia furnish\r\nheavy crops. Russia, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy are all\r\nwheat states.\r\n\r\nIn a normal year all Europe produces a little more than one-half\r\n(fifty-five per cent.) of the world\'s crop. Russia and France excepted,\r\nscarcely another state produces as much as is consumed. Great Britain\r\nconsumes her entire crop in three months; Germany in about six months.\r\nFrance sends a part of her crop to Great Britain and buys of Russia to\r\nfill the deficiency. Russia consumes but very little of her wheat-crop;\r\nit is nearly all sold to the states of western Europe. All Europe\r\nconsumes about one billion seven hundred and ten million bushels, but\r\nproduces about one billion two hundred and fifty million; the remainder\r\nis supplied by the United States, India, Argentina, Africa, and\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEAT IN UNITED STATES]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the great bulk of the crop comes from the upper\r\nMississippi valley and Pacific coast States. About one-third is\r\nconsumed where it is grown; more than one-third is required for the\r\npopulous centres of the east; a little less than one-third is exported,\r\nof which about ninety per cent. goes to Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEAT PRODUCTION]\r\n\r\nMuch of this, especially the Pacific coast product, is sold unground,\r\nbut each year an increasing amount is made into flour. The flour\r\nmanufacture of the United States aggregates somewhat more than\r\n160,000,000 barrels yearly--the output of 16,000 flour-mills; the\r\nPillsbury mills of Minneapolis alone have a capacity of 60,000 barrels a\r\nweek. In Europe the Hungarian mills and their output of Bohemian flour\r\nare the chief competitors of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEAT]\r\n\r\nThe wheat-crop of the Pacific coast has usually been a factor by itself.\r\nOn account of the absence of summer rains, the kernel is both plump and\r\nhard. After the threshing process it is sacked and stored in the fields\r\nin which it has grown.[26] Heretofore much of the sacked wheat has been\r\nshipped to European markets by the Cape Horn route, but in late years a\r\nyearly increasing amount is made into flour and sold in China, Japan,\r\nand Siberia. In 1900 nearly two million barrels were thus sent.\r\n\r\nEast of the Rocky Mountains, after the grain is harvested much of it is\r\nsold to dealers whose storage elevators[27] are scattered all over the\r\nwheat-growing region, and at all great points of shipment, such as\r\nDuluth, Minneapolis, Buffalo, and the eastern seaports. Before the grain\r\nis transferred to the elevators it is inspected and graded, and the cars\r\nwhich contain it are sealed. This wheat constitutes the "visible\r\nsupply." All the business concerning it is transacted by means of\r\n"warehouse receipts," that have almost the currency of ready money.\r\nBanks loan money on them almost to their market value.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions, the cost of growing and harvesting a bushel of\r\nwheat--including interest on the land and deterioration of the\r\nmachinery, etc.--is between fifty and fifty-five cents. The market\r\nprice, when not affected by "corners" and other gambling transactions,\r\nusually varies between sixty-two and eighty-five cents. The difference\r\nbetween these figures is divided between the farmer and the "middlemen,"\r\nthe share of the latter being in the form of commissions and elevator\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STORING PACIFIC COAST WHEAT]\r\n\r\nIn addition to bread-making wheat, certain varieties of grain known as\r\nmacaroni wheat have a certain importance in the market. Several\r\nvarieties are so hardy that they easily resist extremely cold winters;\r\nthey will also grow in regions too dry for ordinary varieties. In this\r\nrespect they are well adapted to the plains at the eastern base of the\r\nRocky Mountains. The only detriment is the lack of a steady market.\r\nMacaroni wheat has a very hard kernel and is rich in gluten. It is used\r\nmainly in the manufacture of macaroni paste, but in Europe, when mixed\r\nwith three times its weight of ordinary soft wheat, it is much used in\r\nmaking flour. The small amount now grown in the United States is shipped\r\nmainly to France.\r\n\r\nThe yield of wheat varies partly with the rainfall, but the difference\r\nis due mainly to skill in cultivation. In western Europe it is from two\r\nto three times as great as in the United States; in Russia and India it\r\nis much less.[28]\r\n\r\nThe yearly consumption of wheat is increasing very rapidly both in the\r\nUnited States and in Europe; moreover, China is becoming a\r\nwheat-consuming country. In the United States the consumption is\r\nincreasing so rapidly that unless either the acreage of the crop, or\r\nelse the yield per acre, is materially increased, there will be no\r\nsurplus for export after the year 1931.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WHEAT INDUSTRY--GRAIN ELEVATORS AT BUFFALO, NEW\r\nYORK]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the acreage may be somewhat increased by the\r\nirrigation of arid lands now uncultivated, and by the reclamation of\r\noverflowed and swamp lands. There are far greater possibilities,\r\nhowever, in the employment of methods of cultivation which will double\r\nthe rate of present yield. It is doubtful if there can be much increase\r\nof acreage in the States of the Mississippi Valley, where the acreage\r\nwill of necessity be lessened rather than increased.\r\n\r\nIn western Europe there can be no material increase of the acreage or\r\nthe rate of yield; in Russia both are possible. The plains of Argentina\r\nnow yield a notable quantity--about one hundred million bushels--and the\r\namount may be increased. Moreover, a large product may be obtained from\r\nboth Uruguay and Paraguay, and southern Brazil, neither one of which\r\nproduces a considerable quantity. At the present rate of the increase in\r\nconsumption, all of the available land, yielding its maximum, will not\r\nproduce a sufficient crop at the end of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\n=Corn.=--Maize or Indian corn is the seed of a plant, _Zea mays_, a member\r\nof the grass family. It is not known to exist in a wild state. The\r\nspecies now cultivated are undoubtedly derived from the American\r\ncontinent, but evidence is not wanting to show that it was known in\r\nChina and the islands of Asia before the discovery of America.[29] The\r\ncommercial history of corn begins with the discovery of America. Next to\r\nmeat it was the chief food of the native American; next to wheat it is\r\nthe chief food-stuff in the American continent to-day.\r\n\r\nCorn requires a rich soil and is not so hardy as wheat. It thrives best\r\nin regions having long summers and warm nights. The growing crop is\r\neasily injured by too much rain. It is an abundant crop in the central\r\nMississippi Valley, but not near the coast; it is very prolific in\r\nNebraska, but not in Dakota; it thrives in Italy, Austria, and the\r\nBalkan Peninsula, but not in the British Isles and Germany. It is a very\r\nimportant crop in Australia, and is the staple grain of Mexico. It is\r\nthe crop of fourteen-hour days and warm nights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORN]\r\n\r\nThe United States is the chief producer of corn, and from an area of\r\n80,000,000 acres--about that of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois\r\ncombined--more than two billion bushels, or four-fifths of the world\'s\r\ncrop, are produced. In the past few years the area planted with corn has\r\nnot materially increased, and it is likely to be lessened rather than\r\nincreased in the future. From the same acreage, however, the annual\r\nyield, now about twenty-five or thirty bushels per acre, can be more\r\nthan doubled by the use of more skilful methods of cultivation.\r\n\r\nCorn contains more fatty substance, or natural oil, than wheat, and\r\ntherefore has a greater heating power. For this reason it is better than\r\nwheat for out-of-door workers, and it is almost the only cereal\r\nfood-stuff consumed in Spanish America. It is also a staple food-stuff\r\nin Egypt. Corn has been used as a bread-stuff in the United States,\r\nItaly, and Rumania[30] for a long time. In recent years, however, its\r\nuse has become very popular in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORN PRODUCTION]\r\n\r\nIn the United States by far the greater part of the crop is consumed\r\nwhere it is grown, being used to fatten swine and cattle. The market\r\nvalue of a pound of corn is about one-third of a cent; converted into\r\npork or beef, however, it is worth five or six times as much. By feeding\r\nthe corn to stock, therefore, a farmer may turn an unmarketable product\r\ninto one for which there is a steady demand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORN]\r\n\r\nAlthough corn is not so essential a staple as wheat, it has a much wider\r\nrange of usefulness. The starch made from it is considered a delicacy\r\nand is used very largely in America and Europe as an article of food.\r\nGlucose, a cheap but wholesome substitute for sugar, is made from it;\r\nfrom the oil a substitute for rubber is prepared; smokeless powder and\r\nother explosives are made from the pith of the stalk; while a very\r\nlarge part of the product is used in the manufacture of liquor.\r\n\r\n=Rye.=--Rye is the seed of a cereal grass, _Secale cereale_, a plant\r\nclosely resembling wheat in external appearance. Rye will grow in soils\r\nthat are too poor for wheat; its northern limit is in latitudes somewhat\r\ngreater than that of wheat, also. It is an ideal crop for the sandy\r\nplain stretching from the Netherlands into central Russia, and this\r\nlocality produces almost the whole yield. The world\'s crop is about one\r\nand a half billion bushels, of which Russia produces nearly two-thirds.\r\nGermany, Austria-Hungary, and Japan grow nearly all the rest. It is\r\nconsumed where it is grown. In the United States the yearly product is\r\nabout twenty-five million bushels, about one-tenth of which is exported\r\nto Europe. Rye-bread is almost always sour, and this fact is its chief\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\n=Barley.=--Barley is the seed of several species of cereal grass, mainly\r\n_Hordeum distichum_ and _Hordeum vulgare_. It is one of the oldest-used\r\nof bread-stuffs. It can be cultivated farther north than wheat, and\r\nabout as far within the tropics as corn; it has, therefore, very wide\r\nlimits. Formerly it was much used in northwestern Europe as a\r\nbread-stuff, but in recent years it has been in part supplanted by wheat\r\nand corn. Barley is a most excellent food for horses, and in California\r\nis grown mainly for this purpose. Its chief use is for the manufacture\r\nof the malt used in brewing.\r\n\r\nThe world\'s crop of barley is not far from one billion bushels, of which\r\nthe United States produces about sixty million bushels. Most of the crop\r\nis grown in the Germanic states of Europe, and in Russia.\r\n\r\n=Oats.=--The oat is the seed of a cereal grass, _Avena sativa_ being the\r\nspecies almost always cultivated. It is not known where the cultivated\r\nspecies originated, but the earliest known locality is central Europe,\r\nwhere it was certainly a domestic plant during the Bronze Age. It seems\r\nprobable that the species now cultivated in Scotland at one time grew\r\nwild in western Europe; certain it is that wild species are found in\r\nNorth America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OATS PRODUCTION]\r\n\r\nThe oat grows within rather wider limits of latitude, and thrives in a\r\ngreater variety of soils than does wheat. Grown in a moist climate,\r\nhowever, the grain is at its best. The oat-crop of the world aggregates\r\nmore than three billion bushels, surpassing that of wheat or corn in\r\nmeasurement, but not in weight. A small portion of this is used as a\r\nbread-stuff, but the greater part is used as horse-food, for which it is\r\nremarkably adapted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OATS]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Russia is the greatest producer, and its yearly oat harvest\r\nis about one-quarter of the world\'s crop. The states of northwestern\r\nEurope yield about half the entire crop; the wheat-growing area of the\r\nUnited States produces the remaining one-fourth. Russia and the United\r\nStates are both exporters, the grain going to western Europe. By far the\r\ngreater part of the grain is consumed where it is grown.\r\n\r\n=Rice.=--Rice is the seed of a cereal grass, _Oryza sativa_. It is claimed\r\nto be native to India, but it is known to have been cultivated in China\r\nfor more than five thousand years. It grows wild in Australia and\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\nRice requires plenty of warmth and moisture. It is cultivated in the\r\nwarmer parts of the temperate zone, but it thrives best in the tropical\r\nregions. In China a considerable upland rice is grown, but for the\r\ngreater part it is grown in level lowlands that may be flooded with\r\nwater. The preparation of the fields is a matter of great expense, for\r\nthey may require flooding and draining at a moment\'s notice. The crop\r\nmatures in from three to six months. After threshing, the seed is still\r\ncovered with a husk, and in this form it is known as "paddy."\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhy is not wheat-growing a profitable industry in the New England\r\nStates?--in the plains at the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains?--in\r\nthe southern part of the United States?\r\n\r\nWhat are meant by the following terms: No. 1 spring, a corner, a disk\r\nharrow, a cradle, a flail, a separator, futures, warehouse certificates?\r\n\r\nIn 1855 the price of a barrel of flour in New York or Boston was about\r\ntwelve dollars; at the close of the century it was less than five.\r\nExplain how the lessened price came about.\r\n\r\nFrom a census or other report make a list of the ten leading\r\nwheat-producing States; the ten that produce the most corn.\r\n\r\nWhy are the foreign shipments of oats less than those of wheat?\r\n\r\nWhat are the prices current of wheat, corn, oats, and barley to-day?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR STUDY AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nObtain samples of the different kinds of wheat, oats, barley, corn,\r\nmillet, and rice. Put the grain in small, closely stoppered vials;\r\nattach the heads of the small grains to sheets of cardboard of the\r\nproper size.\r\n\r\nRead "The Wheat Problem"--Chapter I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICKING COTTON, ALABAMA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRANSPORTING COTTON FROM WHARF, CHARLESTON, S.C.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTTON PRESS YARD, NEW ORLEANS, LA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTEXTILE FIBRES\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the term "textile" are included the fibrous substances that can be\r\nspun into threads, and woven or felted into cloth. Some of these, like\r\nthe covering of the sheep, goat, and llama, or the cocoon of the\r\nsilk-worm, are of animal origin; others, like cotton furze, the husk of\r\nthe cocoanut, and the bast of the flax-plant are vegetable products.\r\nTheir use in the manufacture of cloth antedates the period at which\r\nwritten history begins; it probably begins with the time when primitive\r\nman gradually ceased to have the hairy covering necessary to protect him\r\nfrom the conditions of climate and weather.\r\n\r\nAs body coverings all these substances are dependent on a single\r\nprinciple, namely--they are poor conductors of heat; that is, they do\r\nnot permit the natural heat of the body to pass away quickly, nor do\r\nthey allow sudden changes of the temperature to reach the body quickly.\r\nIn other words, because of the artificial covering which mankind alone\r\nrequires, bodily heat is not dissipated more rapidly than it is created;\r\nif it were, the covering would be worthless. A suit of clothes made of\r\nsteel wire, for instance, because it conducts heat so rapidly, might\r\nchill, or perhaps heat the body more quickly than the open air.\r\n\r\nWith respect to warming qualities wool surpasses all other textiles. It\r\nis employed for clothing in every part of the world and by nearly all\r\npeoples. Cotton is used mainly also for body coverings, but it is\r\ninferior to wool for protection against cold. It is used by practically\r\nall peoples, savage and civilized, outside of the frigid zones. Linen\r\nis inferior both to cotton and wool for clothing; its use is also\r\nrestricted by its great cost. Silk is used mainly for ornamental cloths.\r\nHemp is used mainly for cordage, and the use of ramie, jute, and sisal\r\nhemp is confined mainly to the manufacture of very coarse cloths and\r\nrugs.\r\n\r\n=Cotton.=--The cotton fibre of commerce is the lint surrounding the seeds\r\nof several species of _Gossypium_, plants belonging to the same natural\r\norder as the marshmallow and the hollyhock. The cultivated species have\r\nbeen carried from India to different parts of the world, but\r\ncotton-bearing plants are also native to the American. A native\r\ntree-cotton, known as Barbados cotton, occurs in the West Indies; a\r\nherbaceous cotton-plant is known to have been cultivated in Peru long\r\nbefore the discovery of Columbus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTTON-PRODUCING REGIONS]\r\n\r\nMore than four hundred years before the Christian era Herodotus\r\ndescribes it and mentions a gin for separating the lint from the seed.\r\nNearchus, an admiral serving under Alexander the Great, brought to\r\nEurope specimens of cotton cloth, and in the course of time it became an\r\narticle of commerce among Greek and Roman merchants.\r\n\r\nThe cotton-plant requires warmth, moisture, and a long season. It also\r\nthrives best near the sea. It grows better, on the whole, in subtropical\r\nrather than in tropical regions, and the difference is due probably to\r\nthe longer days and higher temperature of the subtropical latitudes. In\r\nthe United States the northern limit is approximately the thirty-eighth\r\nparallel. The seeds are planted, as a rule, during the first three weeks\r\nof April and the first two of May. The plants bloom about the middle of\r\nJune; the boll or pod matures during July, and bursts about the first of\r\nAugust. The picking begins in August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTTON IN THE UNITED STATES]\r\n\r\nThe yield and the quality of the textile depend not only on conditions\r\nof the soil, but on locality. In the river flood-plains of the southern\r\nUnited States the yield is about two bales per acre; on the bluff lands\r\nit is but little more than one, unless unusual care is taken in the\r\npreparation of the land. The islands off the Carolina coast produce a\r\nvery fine long-staple variety, commercially known as _sea island\r\ncotton_. A district in China produces a good fibre of brownish color\r\nknown as _nankeen_, named for the city of Nanking, whence formerly it\r\nwas exported. The valley of Piura River, Peru, produces varieties of\r\nlong-staple cotton that in quality closely resemble silk.\r\n\r\nThe fibre of ordinary American cotton is about seven-eighths of an inch\r\nlong; it is made into the fabrics commercially known as "domestics" and\r\n"prints," or calico. If the fibre averages a little longer than the\r\ncommon grades it is reserved for canvas. Ordinary Peruvian cotton has a\r\nfibre nearly two inches long; it is used in the manufacture of hosiery\r\nand balbriggan underwear, and also to adulterate wool. The long-staple\r\ncotton of the Piura Valley is bought by British manufacturers at a high\r\nprice, and used in the webbing of rubber tires and hose. Egyptian cotton\r\nis very fine and is used mainly in the manufacture of thread and the\r\nfiner grades of balbriggan underwear. Sea island fibre is nearly two\r\ninches long and is used almost wholly in the making of thread and lace.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of cotton cultivation resulted in very far-reaching\r\nconsequences both from a political as well as an economic stand-point.\r\nThe invention of the steam-engine by Watt gave England an enormous\r\nmechanical power. To utilize this the cotton industry was wrested from\r\nHindustan; the mills were concentrated in Manchester and Lancashire; the\r\ncotton-fields were transferred to the United States.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the plains of Hindustan were strewn with the bodies of\r\nstarved weavers and spinners, but a great industry grew into existence\r\nin England. The invention of spinning machinery by Arkwright, Crompton,\r\nand Hargreaves, and the gradual improvement of the power-loom, greatly\r\nreduced the cost of making the cloth and, at the same time, enormously\r\nincreased the demand for it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTTON PRODUCTION]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the consequences were far more serious. The\r\ninvention of the engine or "gin" for separating the lint from the seed\r\nmade cotton cultivation highly profitable.[31] The negro slaves, who had\r\nbeen scattered throughout the colonies and the States that succeeded\r\nthem, were soon drawn to the cotton-growing States to supply the needed\r\nfield-labor; and, indeed, white workmen could not stand the hot, moist\r\nclimate of the cotton-fields.\r\n\r\nThe cotton-mills grew up in the Northern manufacturing States. The\r\nNorthern manufacturer needed a tariff on imported goods to protect him\r\nfrom European competition; the Southern cotton-planter who purchased\r\nmuch of his supplies abroad was hurt by the tariff. After about sixty\r\nyears of strained relations between the two sections there occurred the\r\nCivil War which wiped out nearly one million lives, and rolled up a\r\ndebt, direct and indirect, of nearly six billions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe world\'s cotton-crop aggregates from twelve million to fifteen\r\nmillion bales yearly, of which the United States produces, as a rule, a\r\nlittle more than three-fourths. Egypt is rapidly taking an important\r\nplace among cotton-producing countries, and, with the completion of the\r\nvarious irrigating canals, will very soon rank next to the United\r\nStates. India ranks about third; China and Korea produce about the same\r\nquantity. There are a few cotton-cloth mills in these states, but in\r\nJapan the manufacture is increasing, the mills being equipped with the\r\nbest of modern machinery. Brazil has a small product, and Russia in Asia\r\nneeds transportation facilities only to increase largely its growing\r\noutput.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTTON]\r\n\r\nThe cotton-crop of the United States is quite evenly distributed;\r\none-third is manufactured at home; one-third is purchased by Great\r\nBritain; and the remaining third goes mainly to western Europe. In the\r\npast few years China has become a constantly increasing purchaser of\r\nAmerican cotton. New Orleans, Galveston, Savannah, and New York are the\r\nchief ports of shipment. The imported Egyptian and Peruvian cotton is\r\nlanded mainly at New York. Most of the cotton manufacture is carried on\r\nin the New England States, but there is a very rapid extension of cotton\r\nmanufacture in the South.\r\n\r\n=Wool.=--The wool of commerce is a term applied to the fleece of the\r\ncommon sheep, to that of certain species of goat, and to that of the\r\ncamel and its kind. There is no hard-and-fast distinction between hair\r\nand wool,[32] but, in general, wool fibres have rough edges, much\r\nresembling overlapping scales which interlock with one another; hair, as\r\na rule, has a hard, smooth surface. If a mass of loose wool be spread\r\nout and beaten, or if it be pressed between rollers, the fibres\r\ninterlock so closely that there results a thick, strong cloth which has\r\nbeen made without either spinning or weaving.\r\n\r\nThis property, known as "felting," gives to wool a great part of its\r\nvalue, and is its chief distinction from hair. Some kinds of hair,\r\nhowever, have a slight felting property, and if sufficiently fine may be\r\nspun and woven. The hair of the common goat is worthless for this\r\npurpose, but that of the Cashmere and Angora species have the properties\r\nof wool. The hair of the Bactrian camel, and also that of the llama,\r\nalpaca, and vicu\xc3\xb1a is soft and fine, possessing felting qualities that\r\nmake it very superior as a textile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOOL PRODUCING REGIONS]\r\n\r\nThe quality of wool varies greatly according to the conditions of soil,\r\nclimate, and the character of the food of the animal. In commerce,\r\nhowever, the fleeces are commonly graded as "long-staple,"\r\n"short-staple," "merino," and "coarse."\r\n\r\nIn long-staple wools the fibres are from four to eight inches long;\r\nthey are more easily separated by a process much like combing, and are\r\ntherefore called "combing" wools. The cotswold, cheviot, and most of the\r\nwools of the British Isles are of this kind; indeed, in fairly moist\r\nlowland regions such as Canada and the United States, there is a\r\ntendency toward the development of a long-staple product. The English\r\nlong-staple wools are largely made into worsted cloth, the Scotch\r\ncheviot into tweeds, and the French into the best dress cloth.\r\n\r\nIf the fibres are materially less than four inches in length, the\r\nproduct is classed as a short-staple or "carding" wool. By far the\r\ngreater part of the wool of the United States, Canada, and Europe is of\r\nthis class. It is disposed of according to its fineness or fitness for\r\nspecial purposes, the greater part being made into cloths for the medium\r\ngrades of men\'s clothing.\r\n\r\nThe finest and softest wool as a rule is grown in arid, plateau regions,\r\nand of this kind of staple the merino is an example. The fibres are fine\r\nas silk, and the goods made from them are softer. The Mission wool of\r\nCalifornia is the product of merino sheep, and, indeed, the conditions\r\nof climate in southern California and Australia are such as to produce\r\nthe best merino wool. The famous Electoral wool of Saxony is a merino,\r\nthe sheep having been introduced into that country from Spain about\r\nthree hundred years ago. The merino wools, as a rule, are used in the\r\nmost highly finished dress and fancy goods.\r\n\r\nThe coarse-staple wools are very largely used for American carpets,\r\ncoarse blankets, and certain kinds of heavy outer clothing. The Russian\r\nDonskoi wool, some of the Argentine fleeces, such as the Cordoban, and\r\nmany of those grown in wet lowlands are very coarse and harsh. The\r\nquality is due more to climatic conditions and food than to the species\r\nof sheep; indeed, sheep that in other regions produce a fine wool, when\r\nintroduced to this locality, after a few generations produce coarse\r\nwool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEEP FEEDING ON ALFALFA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEEP RANGE, UTAH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEEP IN FEEDING YARD\r\n\r\nTHE WOOL-GROWING INDUSTRY]\r\n\r\nThe rug wools grown in Persia, Turkestan, Turkey in Asia, and the\r\nCaucasus Mountains are also characteristic. They vary in fineness, and\r\nbecause they do not readily felt they are the best in the world for rug\r\nstock. The "pile" or surface of the rug remains elastic and stands\r\nupright even after a hundred years of wear. This quality is due mainly\r\nto conditions of climate and soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOOL PRODUCTION]\r\n\r\nIn some instances the wool is obtained by a daily combing of the\r\nhalf-grown lambs. This process, however, is employed in the rug-making\r\ndistricts only; in general, the fleeces are clipped either with shears\r\nor machine clippers. In the United States the latter are generally\r\nemployed, and but little attempt is made either to sort the fleeces or\r\nto separate the various qualities of wool in the same fleece.\r\n\r\nThe raw wool always contains foreign matter such as burs and dirt; it is\r\nalso saturated with a natural oil which prevents felting. The oil,\r\ncommonly called "grease," or "yolk," is an important article of\r\ncommerce; under the name of "lanolin" (_adeps lan\xc3\xa6_) it is used in\r\nmedicine and pharmacy as a basis for ointments.\r\n\r\nThe world\'s yearly clip is a little more than two and one-half billion\r\npounds, of which the United States produces about one-eighth. In Europe\r\nand the United States, owing to the increasing value of the land, the\r\narea of production is decreasing; in Australia, South Africa, and\r\nArgentina, where land is cheap, it is increasing. From these three\r\nregions wool is exported; most European countries and the United States\r\nbuy it. In the latter country the consumption is about six pounds for\r\neach person.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOOL]\r\n\r\nThe wools of the Mediterranean countries--France, Spain, Italy, Algiers,\r\nEgypt, etc.--are the best for fine cloths; those of central Asia for\r\nrugs and shawls; the others are used mainly in medium and low grade\r\ntextiles.\r\n\r\n=Other Wools.=--The Angora goat, originally grown in Anatolia (Asia\r\nMinor), and the Iran States (Persia, Afghanistan, and Baluchistan),\r\nfurnishes a beautiful white wool, commercially known as "mohair." Smyrna\r\nis an important market for it, and England is the chief buyer. The\r\nAngora goat has been introduced into South Africa and California, where\r\nit is successfully grown. From the former country there is a large\r\nexport of mohair.\r\n\r\nCashmere wool is a fine, downy undercovering, obtained by combing the\r\nfleece of a goat native to the Kashmir Valley in India. A single animal\r\nyields scarcely more than an ounce or two, and the best product is worth\r\nabout its weight in gold. It is used in the manufacture of the famous\r\nCashmere shawls, which are sold at prices varying from five hundred to\r\nfive thousand dollars. They are made in Persia and India.\r\n\r\nLlama and alpaca wool are fine textile obtained from animals of the\r\ncamel kind native to South America. The wool is either black or brown in\r\ncolor. A considerable part is used for native-made articles, such as\r\nsaddle-blankets, etc., but much of it is exported to England.\r\n\r\nMost of the "camel\'s hair" of commerce was originally worn by goats,\r\nbeing called by its commercial name because of a similarity in texture\r\nto that of the camel\'s hair. The camel of Turkestan, however, furnishes\r\na silky textile that is much used. The brown wool often found in Hamadan\r\nrugs is natural camel\'s hair, and a considerable amount mixed with\r\nsheep\'s wool is used in certain textiles. The camel\'s hair of China is\r\nmade into artists\' brushes.\r\n\r\n=Silk.=--The silk of commerce is the fibre spun by the larv\xc3\xa6 or\r\ncaterpillars of a moth, _Bombyx mori_, as they enter the chrysalis stage\r\nof existence. The silk-growing industry includes the care and feeding of\r\nthe insect in all its stages. The leaves of the white mulberry-tree\r\n(_morus alba_) are the natural food of the insect, and silk-growing\r\ncannot be carried on in regions where this tree does not thrive. Not all\r\nareas that produce the mulberry-tree, however, will also grow the\r\nsilk-worm; the latter cannot exist in regions having very cold winters,\r\nand therefore the industry is restricted by climate.\r\n\r\nThe moth, shortly after emerging from the chrysalis stage, lays from two\r\nor three hundred to seven hundred eggs. These are "hardy"--that is, they\r\nwill remain fertile for a long time if kept in a cool, dry place;\r\nmoisture will cause them to putrify, and heat to germinate. If well\r\nprotected, they may be transported for distances.\r\n\r\nIn rearing the silk-worm, as soon as the latter is hatched, it is placed\r\non mulberry-leaves, and for five weeks it does nothing but eat, in that\r\ntime consuming many times its weight of food.[33] Then it begins to spin\r\nthe material that forms its chrysalis case or cocoon. The outer part of\r\nthe case consists of a tough envelope not unlike coarse tissue-paper;\r\nthe inner part is a fine thread about one thousand feet long that has\r\nbeen wound around the body of the worm. This thread or filament is the\r\nbasis of the silk textile industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright, 1898, by Nature Study Pub. Co._\r\n\r\nSILK INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n  1. Silkworm Eggs\r\n  2.

Manufactured Silk]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILK PRODUCING REGIONS]\r\n\r\nAt the proper time the cocoons are gathered and, if immediately to be\r\nused, are plunged into hot water. This not only kills the chrysalids but\r\nsoftens the cocoons as well, so that the outer cases may be removed. The\r\ncases removed, the rest of the cocoon is soaked in warm water until the\r\ngummy matter is softened and the fibres are free enough to be reeled. In\r\nthe latter process the ends of a number of cocoons, varying from five to\r\ntwenty, are caught and loosely twisted into a single strand. The silk\r\nthus prepared forms the "raw silk" of commerce. Sometimes a number of\r\nstrands of raw silk are twisted into a coarse thread, thereby forming\r\n"thrown silk." For convenience in handling, both raw and thrown silk\r\nare made into large skeins called hanks, and most of the silk product is\r\nexported in this form.\r\n\r\nA given quantity of cocoons yields scarcely more than one-tenth its\r\nweight in good raw silk. The remaining part, consisting of broken fibres\r\nand cases, is shredded and spun into silk thread of inferior quality.\r\nThis material, commonly called "husks" or "knubs," forms an important\r\nitem in silk manufacture, and much of it is exported to Europe and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILK PRODUCTION]\r\n\r\nAccording to traditions, not wholly trustworthy, eggs of the silk-worm\r\nwere smuggled to India in the head-dress of a Chinese princess. Thence\r\nsericulture slowly made its way westward to Persia, Asia Minor, and the\r\nMediterranean countries. Wild silk, a coarse but strong product, is\r\ngrown in many of these countries, but mainly in China, where it forms an\r\nimportant export. The Chinese product is commercially known as "tussar"\r\nsilk. Of the product of raw silk, about thirty-five million pounds,\r\nChina yields about two-fifths, Japan and Italy each one-fifth. The\r\nremainder is grown in the Levant, Spain, and France.\r\n\r\nMost of the raw silk of China is exported from Shanghai and Canton; that\r\nof Japan is shipped mainly from Yokohama. Among European countries Italy\r\nis the first producer of raw silk, and France the chief manufacturer.\r\nBy the operation of a heavy tariff a considerable manufacture of silk\r\ntextiles has grown up in the United States. New York City and Paterson,\r\nN.J., are the chief centres of the industry.\r\n\r\nThe southern part of the United States offers an ideal locality for\r\nsericulture. Various attempts at silk-worm breeding have failed from\r\nlack of training, but not on account of geographic conditions.\r\n\r\n=Flax.=--The flax of commerce, the basis of linen cloth, is the bast or\r\ninner bark-fibre of an annual plant (_Linum usitalissimum_, _i.e._, most\r\nuseful fibre), native probably to the Mediterranean basin. It ranks\r\namong the oldest known textiles. Bundles of unwrought fibre have been\r\nfound in the lake dwellings of Switzerland, and linen cloth constituted\r\na part of the sepulture wrappings of the ancient Egyptian dead.\r\n\r\nFlax has a very wide range, thriving in the colder parts of Europe as\r\nwell as in tropical Asia; it does equally well in the dry summers of\r\nCalifornia or the moist regions of the Mississippi Valley. The chief\r\nrequisite is a firm soil that contains plenty of nutrition.\r\n\r\nAfter the stalks have passed maturity they are pulled up by hand;\r\n"rippled," or deprived of their seeds and leaves; "retted," or moistened\r\nin soft water until the bast separates; "broken" and "scutched" by a\r\nmachine which gets rid of the woody fibres; and finally the loosened\r\nbast fibre is "hetcheled" or combed in order to separate the long, or\r\n"line," threads from the "tow" or refuse.\r\n\r\nRussia produces more than one-half the world\'s crop, but the finest and\r\nchoicest is that known as Courtrai fibre, which is grown in Belgium.\r\nThis is thought to be due to the quality of the water in the Lys River.\r\nA considerable amount of flax grown elsewhere in Europe is sent to this\r\npart of Belgium to be retted. Ireland and Germany produce considerable\r\namounts, and a small quantity is grown in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe prepared flax is used in the manufacture of linen cloth, and the\r\nlatter is almost exclusively used for table-cloths, napkins,\r\nshirt-bosoms, collars, cuffs, and handkerchiefs. France is noted for the\r\nmanufacture of linen lawns and cambrics, and Belfast, Ireland, for\r\ntable-cloths and napkins. Nearly the whole linen product is consumed in\r\nthe United States, Canada, and western Europe; indeed, linen is a mark\r\nof western civilization. Great Britain handles the greater part of the\r\nlinen textiles.\r\n\r\n=Hemp.=--The true hemp of commerce is the bast or inner bark of a plant,\r\n_Cannabis sativa_, belonging to the nettle order. It is an annual plant\r\nhaving a very wide range; it occurs in pretty nearly every country of\r\nNorth America, Europe, and Asia. In Europe the chief countries producing\r\nit for commercial uses are Russia, France, Italy, and Hungary; in the\r\nUnited States it is grown in California and the central Mississippi\r\nValley. Russia produces the largest crop; Italy the finest quality of\r\nfibre, the best coming from the vicinity of Bologna.\r\n\r\nThe stalks grow three feet or more in height. When cultivated for the\r\nfibre they are pulled from the ground, stripped of their leaves and\r\nsoaked until the fibre is free. They are then "retted," or beaten, and\r\nthe fibre is removed. After preparation the fibre is used mainly for the\r\nmanufacture of wrapping-twine, cordage, and a coarse canvas. Great\r\nBritain is the chief purchaser and manufacturer.\r\n\r\n=Manila Hemp.=--Manila hemp is the name given to a fibre obtained from the\r\nleaves of a plant, _Musa textilis_, belonging to the banana family. The\r\nbest fibres are from six to nine feet in length, of light amber color,\r\nand very strong. The leaves, torn into narrow strips by hand, are\r\nafterward scraped by hand until the fibre is free of pulp. The long and\r\ncoarser fibres are made into rope; the shorter fibres are beaten and\r\nhetcheled in the same manner as flax, until fine enough to weave into\r\nmats, carpets, and fine cloth. The fibres that have served their\r\nusefulness as rope are pulped and manufactured into manila paper.\r\n\r\nPractically all the manila fibre of commerce--which is not hemp at\r\nall--is grown in the Philippine Islands, and since peace has prevailed,\r\nthe growth and production is increasing. The crude fibre is prepared by\r\nhand, by Filipino or by Chinese labor. The manufacture of cordage and\r\npaper is done mainly in the United States and Great Britain. Fine\r\nhand-made textiles are made by a few Filipino natives, but most of the\r\ngoods of this character are manufactured in France. Very fine fibre is\r\nsometimes used as an adulterant of silk. Great Britain and the United\r\nStates are the chief purchasers.\r\n\r\n=Sisal Hemp.=--Sisal hemp, or henequen, is a stout, stringy fibre obtained\r\nfrom the thick leaves of several species of agave, to which the maguey\r\nand century-plant belong. The cultivated species, from which most of the\r\ncommercial product is obtained, is the _Agave sisalina_, which much\r\nresembles the ordinary century-plant.\r\n\r\nThe essential feature in the economic production of sisal hemp is\r\nmachinery for separating the fibre from the pulp of the leaf. The fibre\r\nis whiter, cleaner, and lighter than jute; moreover, in strength it\r\nranks next to the best quality of manila hemp. It is used mainly in the\r\nmanufacture of grain-sacks, and the twine used on self-binding\r\nharvesters. Nearly all the fibre of commerce is grown in the Mexican\r\nstate of Yucatan and consumed in the United States. The cultivation of\r\nthis material has made Yucatan one of the most prosperous states of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n=Jute.=--Jute is a fibre obtained from the inner bark of a tropical plant,\r\n_Corchorus olitorius_, belonging to the same order as the linden-tree.\r\nThe plant is an annual, growing in various moist, tropical countries,\r\nbut is extensively cultivated in India and parts of China for commercial\r\npurposes. The fibre is prepared for manufacture in much the same manner\r\nas hemp and flax. In India it is used mainly for the manufacture of a\r\ncoarse textile known as gunny cloth, used as bale-wrappers, and sacks\r\nfor coffee and rice. On the Pacific coast states it is used for\r\nwheat-sacks. Calcutta is the chief centre of manufacture, but jute-sacks\r\nare extensively manufactured by the Chinese in California and China.\r\n\r\n=Ramie.=--This fibre, also known as China grass, is the best of two or\r\nmore species of nettles, prepared in the same manner as hemp fibre. It\r\nis finer and stronger than jute, and will take dye-stuffs in a superior\r\nmanner. With the introduction of machinery for separating and handling\r\nthe fibre, the cultivation of the ramie-plant has spread from China to\r\nIndia, Japan, and the United States. Fine textiles are now manufactured\r\nfrom it, the most important being carpets, mattings, and American\r\n"Smyrna" rugs. The last are generally sold as jute-rugs, and they are\r\nnearly as durable as woollen floor-covers.\r\n\r\n=Other Economic Fibres.=--The fibre of _cocoanut husk_ is largely employed\r\nin the manufacture of coarse matting. A part of this is obtained from\r\ntropical America, but it is a regular export of British India, where it\r\nis known as _coir_.\r\n\r\nThe mid-rib of the _screw pine_ growing in the forests of tropical\r\nAmerica furnishes the material of which "Panama" hats are made. The hats\r\nare made in various parts of Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia, and were\r\nformerly marketed in Panama. Hats made of a score of grasses and fibres\r\nare also sold as Panamas.\r\n\r\nA plant (_Phormium tenax_) having leaves somewhat like those of the iris\r\nor common flag furnishes the material of which New Zealand flax is\r\nprepared. It is used mainly in the manufacture of cordage.\r\n\r\n_Plaiting straw_, used in the manufacture of hats and bonnets, is grown\r\nextensively in northern Italy and in Belgium. For this product spring\r\nwheat is very thickly sown in a soil rich in lime. The thick sowing\r\nproduces a long, slender stalk; the lime gives it whiteness and\r\nstrength. Plaiting straw is also exported from China and Japan. British\r\nmerchants handle most of the product.\r\n\r\n_Cuba bast_, a fibre readily bleached to whiteness, is exported to the\r\nvarious establishments in which women\'s hats are made.\r\n\r\n_Esparto grass_, also called _alfa_, grows in Spain and the northern\r\npart of Africa. It was formerly much used in the manufacture of the\r\ncheaper grades of paper, but it has been largely supplanted by wood-pulp\r\nfor this purpose. The decline of the esparto grass industry led to no\r\nlittle unrest among some of the native tribes of northern Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat fibres were used in cloth-making in Europe before cotton was\r\nemployed?\r\n\r\nWhat textiles are of necessity made of cotton?\r\n\r\nWhat is a spinning jenny?--a Jacquard loom?\r\n\r\nWhat are the specific differences between cotswold and merino wool?\r\n\r\nWhy were most of the cloth-making mills of the United States built at\r\nfirst in the New England States?\r\n\r\nHow is the silk-making industry encouraged in the United States?\r\n\r\nWhat are the chief linen manufacturing countries?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR STUDY AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nObtain specimens of the cotton seed, boll, raw cotton (sea island,\r\nPeruvian, and ordinary), cotton thread, calico, gingham, domestic,\r\ncanvas, and some of the fancy textiles such as organdie, lawn, etc.\r\n\r\nObtain specimens of the cocoons of the silk-worm, raw silk gros-grain\r\ncloth, pongee, and tussar silk cloth.\r\n\r\nObtain also specimens of merino cloth, cashmere, cheviot, and other\r\nsimilar goods; compare them and note the difference.\r\n\r\nExamine the fibres of cotton, silk, and wool under a microscope and note\r\nthe difference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRANCH OF COFFEE TREE, WEST BRAZIL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE PLANTATION NEAR JOLO, PHILIPPINE ISLANDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE DRYING FIELD, BRAZIL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPLANT PRODUCTS OF ECONOMIC USE--BEVERAGES AND MEDICINAL SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be assumed that practically all beverages derived from plants owe\r\ntheir popularity to the stimulant effects they produce. In coffee, tea,\r\ncocoa, and mat\xc3\xa9, the stimulant principle is identical with _cafein_, the\r\nactive principle of coffee; in liquors it is a powerful narcotic\r\n_alcohol_; non-potable substances, tobacco, opium, etc., owe their\r\npopularity also to narcotic poisons.\r\n\r\n=Coffee.=--The coffee "beans" of commerce are the seeds of a tree (_Coffea\r\narabica_) probably native to Abyssinia, but now cultivated in various\r\nparts of the world. It was introduced into Aden from Africa late in the\r\nfifteenth century, and from there its use spread to other cities. Rather\r\nsingularly its popularity resulted from the strong efforts made to\r\nforbid its use.\r\n\r\nIt was regarded as a stimulant and therefore it was forbidden to\r\nfollowers of Islam.[34] But its power to prevent drowsiness and sleep\r\nduring the intolerably long religious exercises was a winning feature,\r\nand so its use became general in spite of the fulminations against it.\r\n\r\nCoffee culture was confined to Arabia until the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury; it was then introduced into the Dutch East Indies, and for many\r\nyears the island of Java became the main supply of the world. At the\r\npresent time, Java is second only to Brazil in coffee production. In the\r\nOld World it is now also cultivated along the Guinea coast of Africa, in\r\nMadagascar, India, and Ceylon. In the New World the chief areas are\r\nBrazil, Venezuela, the Central American States, and the West Indies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE PRODUCING REGIONS]\r\n\r\nThe coffee-tree may be cultivated in almost any soil that is fertile; it\r\nthrives best, however, in red soil. Old, decomposed red lavas produce\r\nthe choicest beans. Coffee grows in any moist climate in which the\r\ntemperature does not range higher than 80\xc2\xb0 F. nor lower than 55\xc2\xb0 F. An\r\noccasional frost injures but does not necessarily kill the trees, which\r\ngrow better in the shade than in the sunlight. For convenience in\r\ngathering the crop, the trees are pruned until they are not higher than\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the coffee-tree is a deep-red berry not quite so large as a\r\ncherry. A juicy pulp encloses a double membrane, or endocarp, and within\r\nthe latter are the seeds which constitute the coffee of commerce.\r\nNormally there are two seeds, but in some varieties there is a tendency\r\nfor one seed to mature, leaving the other undeveloped; this is the\r\n"peaberry" coffee of commerce. The so-called Mocha coffee is a peaberry.\r\n\r\nIn their preparation the berries are picked when ripe and deprived of\r\ntheir pulp. After pulping they are cured in the sun for about a week and\r\nthen hulled, or divested of the endocarp, a process requiring expensive\r\nmachinery. The coffee is then cleaned, and sacked.\r\n\r\nThe value of the product depends on two factors, age and the care with\r\nwhich it is sorted. Formerly, in the Dutch East Indies, coffee-growing,\r\nfor the greater part, was a government privilege, and the crop was kept\r\nfor several years in storage before it was permitted to be\r\nsold--therefore the term "Old Government" Java. Other coffee was\r\ndesignated as "Private Plantations." The quality of coffee is greatly\r\nimproved with age. Brazilian and other American coffee-beans are rarely\r\nseasoned by storage.\r\n\r\nAmerican coffees are almost wholly sorted by machinery. This process,\r\nhowever, merely collects beans of the same size; it still leaves the\r\ngood and the bad beans together, though it is to be said that among the\r\nlargest beans there are fewer poor ones. In the coffees handled by the\r\nArab dealers all the sorting is done by hand, the very choice grade\r\nselling in the large cities of Europe for the equivalent of nearly three\r\ndollars per pound. All machine-sorted coffee is greatly improved by a\r\nsubsequent hand-sorting to remove the imperfect beans.\r\n\r\nThe naming of the different kinds of coffee is somewhat arbitrary. Thus,\r\nBrazilian coffees are commercially known as _Rio_ because they are\r\nshipped from the port of Rio de Janeiro; the same name is applied to the\r\nproduct shipped from Santos. Nearly all Venezuela coffees are called\r\n_Maracaibo_ although they differ much in kind and quality; most Central\r\nAmerican coffee is sold as _Costa Rica_; most peaberry varieties are\r\nknown as _Mocha_; and most of the East India product is popularly called\r\n_Java_, no matter whence it comes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE PRODUCTION]\r\n\r\nOf the American coffees Rio constitutes about half the world\'s product.\r\nAfter sorting, the larger beans are often marketed as Java coffee, and\r\nwhen the beans have been roasted it is exceedingly difficult to tell the\r\ndifference. The best Maracaibo is regarded as choice coffee, but its\r\nflavor is not liked by all coffee-drinkers. The best Honduras and Puerto\r\nRico coffees take a high rank and command very high prices, retailing in\r\nsome instances at sixty cents per pound. A very choice peaberry is grown\r\nin the volcanic soils of Mexico to which the name of _Oaxaca_ is given;\r\nmost of it is sold in the United States as a choice Mocha.\r\n\r\nMocha is the commercial name of a coffee at one time marketed in the\r\nArabian city of that name. Since the completion of the Suez Canal,\r\nHodeida has been the chief centre of the Arabian coffee-trade. Formerly\r\nmost of this coffee was grown in the Province of Yemen, but now it is\r\nbrought to Hodeida, from Egypt, Ceylon, and India.\r\n\r\nAbout all the product is hand-sorted. The choicest is sold in\r\nConstantinople, Cairo, and other cities near by, in some instances\r\nbringing five dollars per pound. Very little, and only that of the most\r\ninferior quality, ever finds its way into western Europe or the United\r\nStates. Even the best Mocha is not superior to fine Oaxaca coffee.\r\n\r\nJava coffee is renowned the world over for its fine flavor. The best\r\nquality was formerly that which had been held in storage to season for a\r\nfew years. The government coffee was generally the better, but some of\r\nthe private plantations crop is now equally good. Some of the Sumatra\r\ncoffees are equal to the best Java beans.\r\n\r\nThe Liberia coffees have never been favorites in the United States on\r\naccount of their flavor. In Europe they are used for blending with other\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nOf the entire coffee-crop of the world, the United States consumes more\r\nthan three-quarters of a billion pounds--a yearly average of very nearly\r\neleven pounds for each inhabitant. This is nearly three times as much\r\nper inhabitant as is consumed in Germany, and almost fifteen times the\r\naverage used in Great Britain. Nearly all the world\'s crop is consumed\r\nin the United States and western Europe.\r\n\r\nChicory, parched grain, pease, and burnt parsnip are sometimes added as\r\nadulterants to ground coffee. Of those, chicory most nearly resembles\r\ncoffee in flavor and taste. It is harmless and usually improves the\r\nflavor of inferior coffee. A tariff recently placed upon chicory has\r\nsomewhat lessened the use of it.\r\n\r\n=Tea.=--The tea of commerce consists of the dried and prepared leaves of\r\nan evergreen shrub (_Thea chinensis_) belonging most probably to the\r\n_camellia_ family. Tea has been a commercial product of China for more\r\nthan fourteen hundred years, but seems to have been carried thither from\r\nIndia about five hundred years before the Christian era; for its virtues\r\nwere praised by (the probably mythical) Chinung, an emperor of that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated plants are scarcely higher than bushes, but the wild\r\nplant found in India is a tree fifteen or twenty feet in height. The\r\ncultivated plant is quite hardy; severe winters kill it but ordinary\r\nfreezing weather merely retards its growth. It thrives best in red,\r\nmouldy soils; the choicest varieties are grown in new soils. The leaves\r\nare not picked until the plants are three or four years old.\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of tea are known in commerce--the green and the\r\nblack. Formerly these were grown on different varieties of the plant,\r\nbut in the newer plantations no distinction is made in the matter of\r\nvariety; the color is due wholly to the manner of preparation.\r\n\r\nThe plants are watched carefully during the seasons of picking, of which\r\nthere are three or four each year. The April picking yields the choicest\r\ncrop of leaves, and only the youngest leaves and buds are taken.[35] A\r\nsingle plant rarely yields more than four or five ounces of tea yearly.\r\nEach acre of a tea-garden yields about three hundred and fifty pounds.\r\n\r\nAfter picking, the leaves are partly crushed and allowed to wilt until\r\nthey begin to turn brown in color. They are then rolled between the\r\nhands and either dried very slowly in the sun, or else rapidly in pans\r\nover a charcoal fire--a process known as "firing." The former method\r\nproduces _black_, the latter _green_, tea. The color of the latter is\r\nsometimes heightened by the use of a mixture of powdered gypsum and\r\nPrussian blue. In the black teas the green coloring matter of the leaf\r\nis destroyed by fermentation; in the green teas it remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the Chinese tea designed for export is packed rather\r\nloosely in wooden chests lined with sheet-lead, the folds and joints of\r\nwhich are soldered in order to make the cover both air-tight and\r\nmoisture-tight. A full chest contains seventy-five pounds of tea. The\r\nJapan product is also packed in moisture-tight wrappers, the original\r\nparcels being usually ten-pound, five-pound, and pound packages. Similar\r\ndevices are used in preparing the India and Formosa teas for ocean\r\nshipment.\r\n\r\nThe chief tea-producing countries are India (including Ceylon) China,\r\nJapan (including Formosa), and Java. A successful tea-garden is in\r\noperation near Charleston, S.C. A small amount is grown in the Fiji and\r\nSamoan Islands. The Ceylon and Formosa teas take a very high rank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AREA OF TEA PRODUCTION]\r\n\r\nGreat Britain and her colonies consume the bulk of the tea-crop. The\r\naverage yearly consumption per person is eight pounds in Australia, six\r\nin Great Britain and Cape of Good Hope, and more than four in Canada. In\r\nthe United States and Russia it is less than one pound per person.\r\n\r\nBefore the opening of the Suez Canal, in 1869, most of the crop for the\r\nEnglish market was despatched by way of Cape of Good Hope. So important\r\nwas it to get the consignments to London without loss of time, that fast\r\nclipper ships were built especially for carrying tea. Since the opening\r\nof the canal the crop has been shipped mainly by the Suez route.\r\n\r\nA part of the tea required for the United States reaches New York by way\r\nof the Suez Canal, but the movement is gradually changing since the\r\nbuilding of the fast liners that now ply between Asian and American\r\nports. These steamships carry it to Seattle, or to Vancouver, whence it\r\nis distributed by rail. The increased cost of shipment by this route is\r\nmore than offset by a gain of from five to seven days in time.\r\n\r\nIn some respects the Russian "caravan route" is the most important\r\nchannel of the tea-trade. The tea is collected mainly at Tientsin, and\r\nsent by camel caravans through Manchuria to the most convenient point on\r\nthe Siberian railway. Not only the shipments of brick tea[36] for the\r\nRussian market, but the choicest products for western Europe also are\r\nsent by this route. It is probably an economical way of shipping the\r\nbrick tea, but a more expensive method of shipment for the latter could\r\nnot be found easily; it is preferred from the fact that, no matter how\r\ncarefully sealed, the flavor of tea is materially injured by an ocean\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that for the tea product alone the Siberian\r\nrailway will soon become an important factor in the commerce of Europe.\r\nShipments of tea are also sent from Canton to Odessa, Russia, but this\r\nroute is not less expensive in the long run than the Cape route, and the\r\ntea suffers as much deterioration from the shorter as from the longer\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\n=Cacao.=--Cacao, the "cocoa" of commerce, consists of the prepared seeds\r\nof several species of _Theobroma_, the greater part being obtained from\r\nthe _Theobroma cacao_. The name is unfortunately confused with that of\r\nthe cocoa-palm, but there is no relation whatever between the two.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the cacao were used in ancient America long before its\r\ndiscovery by Columbus, and the latter carried the first knowledge of it\r\nto Europe. By the middle of the seventeenth century it was much used in\r\nSpain, and less than a hundred years later it had become the fashionable\r\ndrink of western Europe.\r\n\r\nThe cacao-tree, originally native to Mexico, is now cultivated\r\nthroughout tropical America and the West Indies. It is not cultivated to\r\nany extent in the Eastern continent. The fruit consists of large, fleshy\r\npods, which are cut from the trees usually in June and December. The\r\nseeds are then piled in heaps, or else packed in pits, and allowed to\r\nundergo a rapid fermentation for a period of several days, to which\r\nprocess their flavor is mainly due. The roasted and broken seeds are the\r\ncocoa-nibs of commerce. The husks are known as cocoa-shells.\r\n\r\nA very large part of the cacao product comes from Ecuador, Guayaquil\r\nbeing perhaps the chief market of the world. The Venezuelan and\r\nBrazilian products, however, are the choicest; these are known in\r\ncommerce respectively as Caracas and Trinidad cacao. Spain, Portugal,\r\nand France are the chief purchasers, and in the first-named country the\r\nconsumption per person is five or six times as great as in other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nCacao is not only a stimulant beverage, but a food as well; about\r\none-half its weight is fat, and about one-third consists of starch and\r\nflesh-making substances. The stimulant principle is the same as that\r\noccurring in tea and coffee, but the proportion is considerably less. In\r\npreparing the cocoa for the market, much of the fat is intentionally\r\nwithdrawn. The fat, commercially known as "cocoa-butter," and "oil of\r\ntheobroma," does not turn rancid.\r\n\r\nChocolate consists of cocoa ground to a paste with sugar and flavoring\r\nmatter, and then cast in moulds to harden. It is used mainly in the\r\nmanufacture of confectionery. Most of the chocolate is made in France,\r\nSpain, and the United States. More than forty million pounds of cocoa\r\nare yearly consumed in the United States.\r\n\r\n=Mat\xc3\xa9.=--Mat\xc3\xa9, yerba mat\xc3\xa9, or Paraguay tea, is the leaf of a shrub, a\r\nspecies of holly, growing profusely in the forests of Brazil, Paraguay,\r\nArgentina, and Uruguay. In many instances, the shrub is cultivated. The\r\nleaves are prepared in much the same manner as tea-leaves are, but\r\ninstead of being rolled, they are broken by beating.\r\n\r\nThe mat\xc3\xa9 of commerce has a stimulant principle identical with that of\r\ntea and coffee, which is the only reason for its use. The consumption,\r\nabout fifteen thousand tons a year, is confined almost wholly to the\r\ncountries named.\r\n\r\n=Tobacco.=--The tobacco of commerce is the prepared and manufactured leaf\r\nof several species of plant, belonging to the nightshade family. Most of\r\nthe product is derived from the species known as Virginia tobacco\r\n(_Nicotiana tabacum_) and the Brazilian species (_Nicotiana rustica_).\r\nThe former is cultivated in the United States, West Indies, the\r\nPhilippine Islands, and Turkey; the latter has been transplanted to\r\ncentral Europe and the East Indies.\r\n\r\nThe use of tobacco was prevalent in the New World at the time of\r\nColumbus\'s first voyage, and was quickly introduced into Europe. The\r\nprepared leaf contains a substance, nicotine, which is one of the most\r\ndeadly of poisons when swallowed, and an intense narcotic stimulant when\r\ninhaled. On account of the evil effects arising from its introduction,\r\nits use was forbidden by the Church and also by sovereigns of several\r\nEuropean states. The latter, however, finding that its use was becoming\r\ngeneral, made it a Crown monopoly. In Great Britain its cultivation was\r\nforbidden in order to encourage its cultivation in Virginia.\r\n\r\nTobacco does not thrive best in a poor soil, but the latter produces a\r\nthin, half-developed leaf, which in other plants would be called\r\n"sickly." It grows in almost any kind of soil, but requires warm summer\r\nnights. In many instances the tobacco of temperate latitudes yields a\r\nmore salable leaf when grown under cover. The flavor is due partly to\r\nsoil and climate, and partly to skill in curing. The choicest product is\r\nobtained in only a few localities of limited area. It sometimes happens\r\nthat the products of two plantations almost side by side, and similarly\r\nsituated, are very unlike in character and quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOBACCO]\r\n\r\nThe choicest cigar-tobacco is grown on the Vuelta Abajo district in the\r\nprovince of Pinar del Rio, Cuba; another very choice Cuban leaf is known\r\nas Partidos. Cuban-made cigars of fine quality are commercially "Havana"\r\ncigars, although tobacco from Manila and Porto Rico is apt to be largely\r\nused in their manufacture. In order to avoid the very heavy duty on\r\ncigars, which is not far from six dollars per pound, a great deal of the\r\nHavana tobacco is exported to points along the Florida coast, mainly Key\r\nWest and Tampa. The unmanufactured tobacco pays a comparatively small\r\nduty, and the cigars made from it are commercially known as "Key West."\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Mexico a fine-flavored tobacco is grown, but as the\r\ncigars are not uniform in quality they are not popular. Some of the\r\nBrazilian tobacco is a high-class product, but not much is exported.\r\nPorto Rican leaf has a fine flavor, but is not popular because of its\r\ndark color. The demand for it in the United States is growing, however.\r\nOf the leaf grown in the East, that from Sumatra and the Philippine\r\nIslands is by far the best, and the exports are heavy. Cuban\r\nmanufacturers purchase the Manila leaf; the Sumatra wrappers are\r\npurchased in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe choicest cigarette-tobacco is grown in Asiatic Turkey,\r\nTranscaucasia, and Egypt. It is selected with great care, and is\r\n"long-cut." The common grades are made of chopped Virginia tobacco, or\r\nof chopped cigar-trimmings. The cheapest grades consist of refuse leaf\r\nmixed with half-smoked cigar-stumps. The United States leads in the\r\nmanufacture of cigarettes, and a large part of the product is sold in\r\nChina, India, and Japan. Most of the world\'s product of snuff is made in\r\nthe United States, and nearly all of it is sold abroad.\r\n\r\nThe United States produces yearly about seven hundred million pounds. A\r\nlarge part of this is sold to European countries. Great Britain\r\npurchases about four-fifths of the tobacco there consumed from the\r\nUnited States. The latter country purchases from Europe (mainly the\r\nNetherlands) about half as much as it sells to Europe. Louisville, Ky.,\r\nis probably the largest tobacco-market in the world. New York,\r\nBaltimore, Richmond, Manila, and Havana are the chief shipping-ports.\r\n\r\nIn almost every civilized country tobacco is heavily taxed. In the\r\nUnited States there is not only a heavy import duty, but an internal\r\nrevenue in addition. In Austria, France, Italy, Japan, and Spain the\r\nmanufacture and sale is in the hands of the government. The consumption\r\nof tobacco varies greatly. In the Netherlands it averages about seven\r\npounds a year to each individual; in the United States it is more than\r\nfour pounds; in central Europe, three pounds; in Spain, Sweden, Great\r\nBritain, and Italy, it is less than two pounds.\r\n\r\n=Opium.=--The opium of commerce is the hardened juice obtained from the\r\nseed capsules of several species of the poppy-plant. A variety having a\r\nlarge capsule (_Papaver somniferum_) is most commonly cultivated for the\r\ncommercial production of the substance. Half-a-dozen times during the\r\nseason the capsules are scratched or cut; the juice exuding when hard is\r\npicked or scraped off and pressed into cakes.\r\n\r\nOpium is not only a narcotic poison, but it has the property of\r\nlessening the pain of disease, and this is its chief use in medicine. In\r\nMohammedan countries where the use of alcoholic liquors is forbidden as\r\na religious custom, opium is used as a substitute. In Turkey, Persia,\r\nArabia, and Egypt the production of opium is an important industry\r\nconnected with social and religious life. In British India it is a\r\npolitical factor, being extensively cultivated as a government monopoly\r\nto be sold to the Chinese, who are probably the chief consumers of it.\r\nThe Indian Government derives a revenue sometimes reaching twenty\r\nmillion dollars from this source.\r\n\r\nThe best quality of opium is marketed at Smyrna, and most of this is\r\npurchased by the United States. A considerable amount of Chinese opium\r\nis imported for the use of the Chinese, and a larger amount is probably\r\nsmuggled over the Canadian and Mexican borders. Laudanum is an alcoholic\r\ntincture, and morphine an extractive of opium; both are used as\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nConsult a good physiology and learn the effects of coffee, tea, tobacco,\r\nand opium.\r\n\r\nWhere and what are the following: Mocha, Java, Maracaibo, Yokohama,\r\nAmoy, Canton, Oaxaca, Hodeida, Rio Janeiro, Santos, Havana; how is each\r\nconnected commercially with this chapter?\r\n\r\nFrom the map, Fig. 1, trace the route of a cargo of tea overland from\r\nChina to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nConsult an English history or a cyclop\xc3\xa6dia and learn about the opium\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR STUDY AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nObtain samples of the following, preserving them for study and\r\ninspection in closely stoppered vials: Mocha, Java, Rio, and Sumatra\r\ncoffees; green, black, and gunpowder tea. Soak a tea-leaf a few minutes\r\nin warm water; unroll the leaf and attach it to a white card, for study.\r\n\r\nObtain samples of gum opium, laudanum, and morphine; note the odor of\r\nthe first two and the taste of the last. Remember that they are\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nUnroll a cheap cigarette and note the character of the tobacco in it,\r\nusing a magnifying glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nGUMS AND RESINS USED IN THE ARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMost vegetable juices exposed to the air harden into firm substances,\r\ncommonly called _gum_. Some of these dissolve, or at least soften, in\r\nwater; these technically are known as "gums," and usually are so\r\ndesignated in commerce. Others are insoluble in water, but dissolve\r\nreadily in alcohol, in naphtha, in turpentine, or in other essential\r\noils; these are designated as "gum-resins." Still others yield oils or\r\npitchy substances on distillation; these are known as "oleo-resins."\r\nThere are many other dried vegetable juices, however, that in commerce\r\nare not classified among the gums and resins, and of these the most\r\nimportant is the substance commonly known as india-rubber.\r\n\r\n=Rubber and Rubber Products.=--"Caoutchouc" is approximately the name\r\ngiven by Indians of the Amazon forests to a substance that had also been\r\nfound in India. Some of it was brought to Europe from the Amazon region\r\nas early as 1736, and for nearly one hundred years no general purpose\r\nwas discovered for which it could be used, except to erase lead-pencil\r\nmarks--hence the name india-rubber, which has held ever since.\r\n\r\nCommon rubber is the prepared juice of a dozen or more shrubs and trees,\r\nall of which grow in tropical regions.[37] The belt of rubber-producing\r\nplants extends around the world and includes such well-known species as\r\nthe fig, the manihot (or manioc), and the oleander; indeed, it is a\r\ncondition of sap rather than a definite species of plant that produces\r\nrubber, and the latter is a manufactured rather than a natural product.\r\nThe process of preparing the juice is practically the same in every part\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nThe rubber-gatherer of the Amazon, who is practically a slave, wades\r\ninto the swamp, makes several incisions in the bark of the tree,\r\nfashions a rough trough of clay under it, and waits till the sap fills\r\nthe clay vessel. When the sap has been gathered he makes a fire of the\r\nnuts of the urucuri palm and places an inverted funnel over it to\r\nconcentrate the smoke. He first dips the end of a wooden spindle into\r\nthe juice and then holds it in the smoke until the juice coagulates;\r\nthis process is repeated until there has formed a ball of rubber\r\nweighing from five to ten pounds. The smoke of the palm-nuts is a\r\nchemical agent that converts the juice into the crude rubber of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nCrude gum, however, is lacking both in strength and elasticity. The\r\nprocess that makes it a finished product is known as _vulcanization_.\r\nThe crude rubber, having been exported to the manufacturer in the United\r\nStates or Europe, is shredded, washed, and cleansed, and partly fused\r\nwith varying proportions of sulphur. For a very soft product, such as\r\nthe inner surface of tires, only a small proportion is used; where the\r\nwear is considerable, a larger proportion is employed.[38] White clay is\r\nsometimes added to give body to the product; coloring matter is also\r\nsometimes added.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater part of the crude rubber comes from the Amazon\r\nforests. Brazil produces about one-half, but a considerable quantity is\r\nobtained in Acr\xc3\xa9, the territory formed where the borders of Brazil,\r\nBolivia, and Peru meet, and now ceded to Brazil. Nearly all this\r\nproduct, that of the Cear\xc3\xa1 region excepted, is marketed at Par\xc3\xa1 and is\r\nknown as Par\xc3\xa1 rubber. It is the best produced. The African product,\r\nmainly from the forests of the Kongo, and Madagascar, and nearly all the\r\nEast Indian product is sent to Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REGIONS YIELDING RUBBER]\r\n\r\nThe world\'s product is about one hundred and thirty-three million pounds\r\nof crude rubber. Of this product the United States takes nearly\r\none-half. The greater part is used in the manufacture of pneumatic\r\ntires, hose, and overshoes. A large part is used for making water-proof\r\ncloth,[39] and considerable is made into the small elastic bands for\r\nwhich there is a growing use.\r\n\r\n=Gutta-Percha.=--Gutta-percha is obtained from the juices of several\r\nplants (chiefly _Dichopsis gutta_ and _Supota m\xc3\xbclleri_) both of which\r\nabound in the Malay peninsula and the East Indies. It is prepared in a\r\nmanner somewhat similar to that employed in making crude rubber; it is\r\nalso easily vulcanized by heating with sulphur. It is used to a limited\r\nextent in the manufacture of golf-balls, but mainly as the insulating\r\ncover of copper wires used in ocean telegraph cables. For this purpose\r\nit has no known substitute, and its essential merit is the fact that it\r\nis not altered by salt water. Nearly all the product is shipped from\r\nSingapore to England.\r\n\r\n=Pine-Tree Products.=--The various members of the pine and cone-bearing\r\ntrees yield valuable essential oils and oleo-resins that are very\r\nimportant in the arts and sciences. These, in nearly every instance, are\r\nprepared from the sap of the tree.\r\n\r\n_Oil of turpentine_ is known as an "essential oil," and in chemical\r\nstructure and properties it does not differ from the various essential\r\noils, such as lemon, orange, peppermint, etc. Commercial turpentine is\r\ngenerally made from the sap of the long-leafed pine of the Atlantic\r\ncoast-plain.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the tree is cut near the foot, and the sap that oozes from\r\nthe scar quickly hardens into a gum. The gum, generally known as "crude\r\nturpentine," is distilled and yields about one-fourth its weight of oil\r\nor "spirit" of turpentine. It is a staple article of manufacture in\r\nEurope, India, and the United States, and is used chiefly to dilute the\r\noil paints and varnishes used in indoor work. The United States supplies\r\nabout two-thirds of the world\'s product, a large part of which is\r\nshipped from Savannah and Brunswick, Ga., to Great Britain.[40]\r\n\r\n_Resin_ is the substance remaining after the crude turpentine has been\r\ndistilled. It is used in the manufacture of varnish, sealing-wax, and\r\nsoap. Finely powdered resin is also mixed with wood-pulp in the\r\nmanufacture of wrapping-paper. It gives the latter a glazed surface and\r\nrenders it almost water-proof. Most of the world\'s product of resin\r\ncomes from the turpentine district of the United States, and about\r\nfour-fifths of it is exported to Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen resin is subjected to distillation at a still higher temperature,\r\n_resin oil_, a very heavy turpentine, is given off, and a viscous\r\nsubstance known as _pitch_ remains. A considerable amount of this is\r\nstill made in the United States, but the greater part comes from the\r\npine-forests of Russia and Scandinavia. When pine-wood is distilled,\r\n_tar_ is the chief product. In Russia tar is generally made by burning\r\ngreen logs covered with turf, over a pit. _Creosote_, or wood\r\npreservative, is made from tar. The various pine-tree products, creosote\r\nexcepted, are commonly known as "naval stores," the tar being used in\r\nwater-proofing the rigging of vessels, the pitch in calking the seams in\r\nbetween planks, in the decks and hulls.\r\n\r\n=Other Resins and Gums Used in the Arts.=--Most of the gums and resins\r\nused in the arts and sciences are the hardened sap of plants--in some\r\ncases exuding by natural means from the bark, in others resulting from\r\nthe puncture of the bark.\r\n\r\nThe _lac_ of commerce is due to the puncture of the young branches of a\r\ntree, frequently a fig (_Ficus religiosa_) growing in the tropical\r\nforests of India. The hardened sap incrusts twigs forming _stick-lac_;\r\nwhen crushed, washed, and freed from the woody matter it is _seed-lac_;\r\nwhen melted and cooled in flakes it is _shell-lac_, the form best known\r\nin commerce. It is the chief ingredient in sealing-wax, and is\r\nextensively used as a varnish. It is also used in fireworks on account\r\nof its inflammability.\r\n\r\n_Dammar_ is the product of a tree growing in the East Indies; it is the\r\nbasis of a very fine white varnish. _Copal_ is a term applied to\r\noleo-resins soluble in turpentine, and used almost universally as\r\nvarnishes. They come from the tropical regions of South America, Africa,\r\nand from the East Indies. _Kauri_ is the fossil gum of a cone-bearing\r\ntree dug from the ground in northern New Zealand. _Amber_ is the fossil\r\ngum of extinct cone-bearing trees found mainly along the Baltic coast of\r\nPrussia. It is used chiefly for the mouth-pieces of tobacco-pipes and\r\ncigar-holders; the inferior product is made into varnish. It is sold\r\nwherever tobacco is used. _Sandarach_, found on the north African coast,\r\nis used principally in Europe, being employed as a varnish. The United\r\nStates and Great Britain consume most of the foregoing products.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nName any elastic substance you know about that is in every way a\r\nsubstitute for rubber.\r\n\r\nWhat has been the relation between rubber and good roads?\r\n\r\nDescribe the structure of a bicycle tire.\r\n\r\nWhy are tar, pitch, and turpentine called naval stores?--and what\r\ndetermines the locality in which they are made?\r\n\r\nWhat is varnish, and for what purposes is it used?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR STUDY AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nObtain specimens of crude rubber, vulcanized rubber, and hard rubber;\r\nnote carefully the characteristics of each.\r\n\r\nBurn a very small piece of cheap white rubber-tubing in an iron spoon or\r\na fire-shovel; note the character of the residue.\r\n\r\nObtain specimens of gutta-percha, resin, pitch, turpentine, shellac,\r\ncopal, dammar, and creosote for study and inspection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCOAL AND PETROLEUM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe economic history of nearly every country that has achieved eminence\r\nin modern times dates from its use of coal and iron; and indeed the\r\npresence of these substances in workable deposits means almost unlimited\r\npower. The present era is sometimes called the Age of Steel, but the\r\npossibilities of producing steel in enormous quantities, at less than\r\none-fifth its price at the beginning of the nineteenth century, depended\r\nmainly upon the use of mineral coal instead of charcoal in its\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nCoal consists of accumulations of vegetable matter that were formed in\r\nprior geological ages. Under the action of heat and moisture, and also\r\nthe tremendous pressure of the rock layers that afterward covered them,\r\nthe vegetable matter was converted to mineral coal.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate coal-fields of the United States are not far from two\r\nhundred thousand square miles in extent, but of this area not much more\r\nthan one-half is workable. In Europe there are estimated to be about one\r\nhundred thousand square miles of coal-lands, of which about half are\r\nproductive at the present time. Of this Great Britain has 12,000 square\r\nmiles, Spain 4,000, France 2,000, Germany 1,800, and Belgium 500. In\r\nCanada there are about 20,000 square miles of coal-land; a part of this\r\nis included in the Nanaimo field on the Pacific coast, but the most\r\nimportant are the Nova Scotia beds, which form about the only supply for\r\nthe British naval stations of America. China has extensive coal-fields.\r\n\r\nIn character coal is broadly divided into two classes--anthracite or\r\nhard, and bituminous or soft, coal. Anthracite coal occurs in folded and\r\nmetamorphic rocks. It is hard and glassy, and does not split into thin\r\nlayers or leaves. The beds have been subjected to intense heat and\r\npressure, and the coal has but a very small amount--rarely more than\r\nfive per cent.--of volatile matter; it burns, therefore, with little or\r\nno smoke and soot, and on this account is very desirable as a fuel in\r\ncities. Two areas in Colorado and New Mexico produce small quantities of\r\npure anthracite; practically all the commercial anthracite comes from\r\nthree small basins in Pennsylvania. In quality it is known as "red ash"\r\nand "white ash," the former being the superior.\r\n\r\nThe yearly output of the anthracite mines is upward of fifty-five\r\nmillion long tons a year, or somewhat less than five million tons per\r\nmonth. In winter the rate of consumption is somewhat greater than that\r\nof production. A shortage in the summer production is therefore apt to\r\nbe keenly felt in the winter. Before shipment to the market the coal is\r\ncrushed at the breakers, sorted in different sizes, and washed.\r\n\r\nMost of the anthracite coal-mines are owned by the railway companies\r\ncentring at New York and Philadelphia, or else are operated by companies\r\ncontrolled by the railways. About one-fourth of the output is produced\r\nby independent operators who, as a rule, sell their coal to the railway\r\ncompanies. The Reading, Pennsylvania, Central of New Jersey, Lackawanna,\r\nLehigh Valley, Ontario & Western, Erie, and Delaware & Hudson are\r\npopularly known as "coalers" because the larger part of their eastern\r\nbusiness consists in carrying anthracite coal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VIEW OF THREE COLLIERIES IN THE ANTHRACITE COAL BASIN\r\nNEAR MAHANOY CITY, PA.]\r\n\r\nFormerly much of the coal was shipped by canals, but the latter were\r\nnot able to compete with the railways, and most of the coal-canals have\r\nbeen abandoned. The price of anthracite at tide-water (New York) varies\r\nfrom $3.20 to $4.50 per long ton. At Philadelphia the price is about\r\none-fourth less. Buffalo is the chief lake-port for anthracite. Steam\r\nsizes are about two-thirds the price of house fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COAL FIELDS IN UNITED STATES]\r\n\r\nBituminous, or soft coal furnishes the larger part of the house fuel in\r\nthe United States, and nearly all the house coal used in other parts of\r\nthe world. It contains from fifteen to more than forty per cent. of\r\nvolatile matter, burning with a long and smoky flame. The coal which\r\ncontains twenty per cent. or less of volatile matter is a free-burning\r\ncoal that may develop heat enough to partly fuse the ash, forming\r\n"clinkers"; it is therefore called "caking" coal, and is not only well\r\nadapted for use as fuel and steam-making, but it is also a good smelting\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nCoal which contains more than thirty per cent. of volatile matter is\r\nknown as "fat" coal and is generally used in the manufacture of coke and\r\nilluminating gas. Western Pennsylvania produces the largest amount of\r\nfat coal, but it is found here and there in nearly all soft-coal\r\nregions. A so-called smokeless bituminous coal occurs in various\r\nlocalities; its low percentage of volatile matter makes it an excellent\r\nhouse fuel.\r\n\r\nBituminous coal is mined in twenty-five States of the Union,\r\nPennsylvania, Illinois, West Virginia, and Ohio heading the list. In\r\nabout half the mines the coal is cut from the seam by means of machinery\r\nand is known as machine-mined coal. A very large part of the product is\r\nconsumed within a short distance of the mines, and this is especially\r\ntrue of the region about the upper Ohio River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COAL PRODUCTION]\r\n\r\nMost of the product is shipped to the large manufacturing cities of the\r\nmiddle west, where it is used for steam as well as fuel; a very large\r\namount also is sent down the Ohio in barges to the lower Mississippi\r\nRiver. The spot value of bituminous coal varies from $0.80 to $1.60 per\r\nton; the product of the Pacific coast mines, however, is from $3 to $5.\r\n\r\nThe output of the mines of the United States aggregates about two\r\nhundred and forty million long tons yearly, and this is about one-third\r\nof the world\'s product. For many years there has been an export trade to\r\nCanada, the West Indies, Central and South America, amounting in 1900 to\r\n8,000,000 tons. Within a few years, however, the decreased cost of\r\nmining due to machinery, and the low rates of transportation to the\r\nseaboard has developed an export trade to Russia, Germany, and France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COAL]\r\n\r\nA small amount of coal is imported into the United States. A superior\r\nquality of Australian coal finds a ready market in Pacific coast points\r\nas far north as San Francisco, and large quantities of Nanaimo, B.C.,\r\ncoal are sold in Oregon, Washington, and California. A small quantity of\r\nthe "slack" or waste of the Nova Scotia mines is imported to Boston to\r\nbe made into coke. The Canadian fields supply a considerable part of the\r\ncoal used in Montana.\r\n\r\n=Coke and Coal-Tar Products.=--In the manufacture of iron and steel a fuel\r\nhaving a high percentage of carbon free from volatile matter is\r\nessential. The great cost of wood charcoal forbids its use, and so a\r\ncharcoal made from soft coal is used. Fat coal is heated in closed\r\nchambers until the volatile matter is driven off. The product is "coke";\r\nthe closed chamber is an "oven." The ovens are built of stone or\r\nfire-brick, in a long row. They are usually on an abrupt slope, so that\r\nthe coal can be dumped into the top, while the coke can be withdrawn\r\nfrom the bottom, to be loaded into cars.\r\n\r\nAbout three thousand one hundred and forty pounds of coal are required\r\nto make a short ton of coke; from three thousand to five thousand cubic\r\nfeet of illuminating gas, together with varying amounts of coal-tar and\r\nammonia, are driven off and generally wasted. In a few instances\r\n"scientific" ovens are in use for the purpose of saving these products;\r\nbut in the coal-mining regions such devices are the exception and not\r\nthe rule. The great waste of energy-products in the manufacture of coke\r\nis partly offset by the employment of refuse and slack, which could not\r\nbe otherwise used.\r\n\r\nThere are more than five hundred and eighteen thousand coke-ovens in\r\nthe United States, of which eighty per cent. are in use. Most of them\r\nare in the region about the upper Ohio River, and nearly half the total\r\nnumber is in the vicinity of Connellsville. The region around\r\nBirmingham, Ala., ranks next in number. The coke product of the United\r\nStates is more than twenty million short tons a year. This is\r\nconsiderably less than the product of Great Britain, which is upward of\r\ntwenty-five million tons.\r\n\r\nMost of the "scientific" ovens are near or in large cities where the\r\ngas, after purification, is used for illuminating purposes. In some\r\ninstances the coke, and not the gas, is a by-product. The coal-tar is\r\nused in part for fuel, but a portion of it goes to the chemical\r\nlaboratory, where it is made to yield ammonia, benzine, carbolic acid,\r\nand aniline dyes to the value of nearly seven million dollars.\r\n\r\n=Graphite.=--Graphite, plumbago, or "black lead," as it is popularly\r\nnamed, is found in many parts of the United States, but only a few\r\nlocalities produce a good commercial article; these are Ticonderoga, N.Y.,\r\nwhich yields from six hundred to two thousand tons a year, and\r\nChester County, Pa., which yields a small but increasing amount; a good\r\nquality is mined near Ottawa, Canada. It is extensively mined in Ceylon,\r\nand this island produces the chief bulk of the world\'s ordinary product.\r\nThe finest grade comes from the Alibert mine in Siberia. A good article\r\nis manufactured artificially at Niagara Falls.\r\n\r\nGraphite is used as a stove polish and for crucibles; in the main,\r\nhowever, it is employed in the manufacture of lead[41] pencils; for this\r\npurpose only a very soft mineral, absolutely free from grit, is\r\nemployed, and the Siberian output is used almost wholly. One German firm\r\nand two American firms supply most of the pencils used.\r\n\r\n=Petroleum.=--Petroleum is the name given to a natural liquid mineral from\r\nwhich the well-known illuminating oil "kerosene" is derived, and to\r\nobtain which it is mined. Petroleum is a mixture of various compounds\r\nknown as hydrocarbons. Some of these compounds are gaseous, some are\r\nliquid, and some are solid; all of them are articles of commercial\r\nvalue. The petroleum from different localities differs greatly in\r\nappearance and composition.\r\n\r\nThe pitch that coated Noah\'s ark, the slime of the builders of the Tower\r\nof Babel, and the slime-pits of the Vale of Siddim all refer to mineral\r\nproducts associated with petroleum. Under the name of "naphtha" it has\r\nbeen known in Persia for thirty centuries, and for more than half as\r\nlong a flowing oil spring has existed in the Ionian Islands. The Seneca\r\nIndians knew of a petroleum spring near the village of Cuba, N.Y., and\r\nused it as a medicine long before the advent of the white man.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1850 illuminating oil, known as "coal" oil, was made in the\r\nUnited States by distilling cannel coal, but this product was supplanted\r\nwithin a few years by the natural petroleum discovered in Pennsylvania.\r\nIn 1859 Colonel Drake completed a well bored in solid rock near\r\nTitusville, Pa. The venture proved successful, and in a few years\r\npetroleum mining became one of the great industries of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nPetroleum is known to exist in a great many parts of the world; the\r\nUnited States and Russia, however, produce practically all the\r\ncommercial product; a very small amount is obtained from a horizon on\r\nthe south slope of the Carpathian Mountains, situated in Rumania and\r\nGalicia, Austria-Hungary. There are also a few producing wells in Peru,\r\nGermany, Italy, Burma, Argentina, and Sumatra.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETROLEUM FIELDS IN THE UNITED STATES]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the largest horizon is that of the Appalachian\r\nregion. Since 1859 it has produced more than forty million gallons of\r\ncrude oil. The Lima, Ind., horizon produces about twenty million\r\nbarrels. The California and Texas horizons have become very important\r\nfactors. The crude petroleum is transported partly in tank cars, but\r\nmainly by means of long lines of pipe, flowing from one pumping station\r\nto another by gravity. There are pipe-line terminals on the Great Lakes\r\nand at Pittsburg, but the principal are at the refining and exporting\r\nstations in New York, Philadelphia, and on the Delaware River.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount is exported to European countries to be there\r\nrefined, but in the main the crude oil is refined before exporting it.\r\nSome of the refined oil is exported in barrels, and some in tin cases;\r\nthe greater part, however, goes in tank steamers, and from these it is\r\npumped into tank cars to be distributed. Most of the product is\r\ncontrolled by the Standard Oil Company, and it reaches nearly every\r\ncountry in the world. It is carried into Arctic regions on sledges, and\r\nover the African deserts by caravans. Great Britain, Germany, and the\r\nNetherlands are the chief purchasers and distributors. The value of the\r\nentire product is about one hundred and eighty-five million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe Russian oil-producing region is on and near the Apsheron peninsula,\r\na small area of Trans-Caucasia, that extends into the Caspian Sea; the\r\nregion is commonly known as the Baku field, and in 1900 the production\r\nof crude oil surpassed that of the United States. The petroleum is\r\nconveyed by pipe lines to the refineries at Baku. From this port it is\r\nshipped in tank cars by rail to Batum, whence it is conveyed to the\r\nvarious European markets. A considerable part of the product is sent by\r\ntank steamers to Astrakhan, and thence up the Volga to Russian markets.\r\nGreat Britain takes about one-third; about the same amount is shipped to\r\nPort Sa\xc3\xafd for China, India, and other Asian markets; the rest is\r\nconsumed in central Europe.\r\n\r\n=Petroleum Products.=--The various constituents of crude petroleum differ\r\ngreatly in character, some being much more volatile than others. They\r\nare separated by distillation at different temperatures. By this process\r\nnaphtha, rhigoline, gasoline, benzine, and other highly inflammable\r\nproducts are obtained in separate receivers. By a similar process the\r\nilluminating or refined oil and the lubricating oils are also separated.\r\nThe residuum consists of a gummy mass from which paraffine and petroleum\r\njelly are extracted.\r\n\r\n_Naphtha_ usually contains several volatile compounds, including\r\n_benzine_ and _gasoline_. It is used as a solvent of grease and also of\r\ncrude india-rubber, but chiefly the manufacture of illuminating gas.\r\n\r\n_Kerosene_ is the name commonly given to the refined oil. A good\r\nquality should have a fire test of not less than one hundred and fifty\r\ndegrees; that is, when heated to that temperature, it should not give\r\noff any inflammable gas. This test is now mandatory in most States.\r\n\r\n_Lubricating oil_ is used almost wholly for the lubrication of heavy\r\nmachinery. It varies greatly in composition and quality.\r\n\r\n_Paraffine_ or petroleum wax has largely superseded beeswax; it is used\r\nmainly in the manufacture of candles and as an insulator for electric\r\nwires. A native mineral paraffine, known as ozocerite, is mined in Utah\r\nand Galicia; it is used as an insulating material.\r\n\r\n"_Vaseline_," "_cosmoline_," or _petroleum "jelly"_ is very largely used\r\nin pharmacy as the basis of ointments and also as a lubricant for heavy\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\n_Asphalt_ is produced by the distillation of petroleum, but the greater\r\npart of the world\'s product comes from two "pitch lakes"--one in\r\nBermudez, Venezuela, the other in the island of Trinidad, off the\r\nVenezuelan coast. The former is the larger and produces a superior\r\nquality. Small deposits occur near Los Angeles, Cal., and in Utah. The\r\noutput of the Venezuelan asphalt is used almost wholly for street\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nProbably no other mineral has had a wider influence on both social and\r\neconomic life, and the industrial arts, than petroleum and its\r\ncompounds. The kerosene lamp, the aniline dye, the insulation of\r\nelectric wires, the lubrication of machinery, the cosmetic, the\r\nindia-rubber solution, and the physician\'s sedative dose represent only\r\na few of the devices that are derived from petroleum.\r\n\r\n=Natural Gas.=--A natural inflammable gas occurs in or near several of the\r\npetroleum horizons. One important belt extends through western\r\nPennsylvania and New York, and another through northwestern Ohio and\r\nnortheastern Indiana. It is conveyed through pipe-lines and used both as\r\nfuel and for lighting. Natural gas occurs in a great many localities,\r\nbut is used commercially only in the regions noted. It is better adapted\r\nfor making glass than any other fuel, and on this account extensive\r\nglass-making establishments have concentrated in the natural-gas belt of\r\nwestern Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe statement is sometimes made to the effect that coal is "condensed\r\nsunlight"; is it true, or untrue; and why?\r\n\r\nWhy are the coal areas of Europe and America also areas of various\r\nmanufactures?\r\n\r\nA recent cartoon had for its title--"John Bull and his coal piles\r\n(_i.e._, coaling stations) rule the world"; show why this statement\r\ncontains a great deal of truth.\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the advantages of steam-vessels over sailing-vessels?\r\n\r\nWhale oil, crude turpentine, kerosene, and gas have been used each in\r\nturn for illuminants; what is the advantage of each over the preceding?\r\n\r\nDescribe the structure of an ordinary kerosene lamp-burner, an argand\r\nburner, a Welsbach burner.\r\n\r\nFor what are aniline, paraffine, naphtha, and carbolic acid used?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR STUDY AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nObtain specimens of anthracite, bituminous, and cannel coal, and coke\r\nfor comparison and study.\r\n\r\nObtain specimens of crude petroleum, naphtha, refined oil, aniline dye,\r\nparaffine, and carbolic acid; note the properties of each.

Their effect on the affairs\r\nof mankind can be rightly understood only when they are studied in their\r\nrelations to one another, as well as to the people who used them. Next\r\nto the discovery of the use of fire, an appreciation of the use of\r\nmetals has been the chief thing to develop the intellect of mankind.\r\nWhen human beings discarded natural caves for artificially constructed\r\ndwellings--when they began to cook their food and clothe their bodies,\r\nthey required tools. These, in the main, consisted of the spears and\r\narrow-heads used as weapons of the chase, and the axes and knives used\r\nas constructive tools.\r\n\r\nRough stone gave place to flint because the latter would take a better\r\nedge. For the same reason the people of central Europe sent to the\r\ndeserts of central Asia for jade wherewith to make axes and knives.\r\nAgain, for the same reason, jade was discarded, because an alloy of\r\ncopper and tin produced a bronze that would not only take a sharper edge\r\nthan stone, but it was hard enough to cut and dress the latter. Egypt\r\nrose to a commanding position because of her control of the copper mines\r\nin the Sinaitic peninsula, and subsequently of the gold products coming\r\nfrom the upper Nile.\r\n\r\nA meridian drawn through Cairo, Egypt, practically divides the world\r\ninto two kinds of civilization. East of this meridian the population is\r\nalmost wholly agricultural and, excepting Japan and India, the\r\ncharacter of the civilization has changed but little in the past 2,000\r\nyears. West of the line the population is essentially characterized as\r\nmetal-workers. It controls the world--not especially by virtue of a high\r\ndegree of intellectual development, but because it has availed itself of\r\nthe properties and characteristics of metals and their applications to\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe four metals that have had the greatest influence on western\r\ncivilization are gold, silver, iron, and copper. The discovery of gold\r\nand silver has always resulted in a rapid settlement of the regions in\r\nwhich the discoveries were made, and usually in the building of great\r\nindustrial centres. Thus, the discovery of gold in California was the\r\nfirst step in making the United States a world power. The acquisition of\r\nso large an amount of gold caused an industrial expansion that hurried\r\nthe Civil War, and led to the manufacture of iron and steel both for\r\nagricultural machinery and railroad transportation. This, in turn,\r\nbrought the country so closely in touch with the affairs of China and\r\nJapan, that European and American diplomacy in eastern Asia are a common\r\nconcern. The commercial position of Great Britain is very largely due to\r\nher iron mines.\r\n\r\nThe production of Bessemer steel at a price far less than that of iron\r\nat the beginning of the nineteenth century lowered the cost of\r\ntransporting commodities to the extent that large areas, once of\r\nnecessity very moderately productive of food-stuffs, are now densely\r\npeopled because food-stuffs can be transported to these regions more\r\neconomically than they can be grown there. Thus, owing to the\r\nimprovements in iron and steel manufacture, the farmer of Minnesota, the\r\nplanter of Louisiana, the miner of Colorado, and the factory operative\r\nof Massachusetts have each the same comforts of living that are enjoyed\r\nby all the others, and have them at scarcely more than half the cost of\r\nfifty years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEEL MANUFACTURE--THE NATIONAL STEEL COMPANY\'S SMELTERY\r\nAND ROLLING-MILLS, MINGO JUNCTION, OHIO]\r\n\r\nThe gradual decrease in the production of the silver mines near the\r\npresent site of Ergasteria proved a beginning of the fall of Athens; and\r\nwhen gold was discovered in the Perim Mountains of Macedonia, the seat\r\nof Greek power moved thither. Philip of Macedon hoarded the treasure\r\nfrom the mines of Pang\xc3\xa6us, and with the capital thus acquired his son,\r\nAlexander the Great, conquered the East, implanted Hellenic business\r\nmethods there, and drew the various trade routes between Europe and Asia\r\nunder one control.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century copper from the mines near Budapest and silver\r\nfrom the Schwarz Mountains of Germany were the resources that made\r\nGermanic Europe pre-eminent. The wresting of the trade in these two\r\nmetals from Venice caused the rise of Antwerp and brought immense gains\r\nto L\xc3\xbcbeck, London, Brussels, Augsburg, and Nuremberg. In the latter part\r\nof the nineteenth century copper again reached a high position of\r\nimportance from the fact that upon it largely depends electric motive\r\npower and transportation.\r\n\r\n=Iron.=--Iron is one of the most widely diffused of metals. It is abundant\r\nin the sun; meteorites contain from more than ten to eighty or ninety\r\nper cent. of it; all earths and rocks contain at least traces of it; and\r\nin various places the deposits of ore in nearly pure form aggregate\r\ncubic miles in extent.\r\n\r\nIn only a few localities is iron ore found in a metallic or "native"\r\nform. Many meteorites consist of metallic iron mixed with nickel and\r\nmanganese, and in Greenland a volcanic dyke or ledge of metallic iron is\r\nknown to exist. The iron of commerce is derived from "ores," or chemical\r\ncompounds of iron and oxygen, or iron and carbon. The cheapness of the\r\nproduct depends upon the ease with which the ore may be quarried,\r\ntransported to coal, and smelted. The following are the ores commonly\r\nemployed in the production of iron:\r\n\r\n_Red hematite_ has a reddish metallic lustre and when pure contains\r\nseventy per cent. of iron.[42] It is the most abundant of the workable\r\nores, and certainly the best for the manufacture of Bessemer steel. The\r\nores of the Lake Superior region are mainly red hematite, and the latter\r\nconstitutes more than four-fifths of the output of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COMPARATIVE PRODUCTION OF IRON AND STEEL]\r\n\r\n_Brown hematite_, or limonite, has a chestnut brown color and contains\r\nvery nearly sixty per cent. of iron[43]; it includes the "bog" ores, and\r\nis very abundant. Not far from one-quarter of the Appalachian ores are\r\nbrown hematite; it constitutes about one-eighth of the output of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n_Magnetic_ iron ore, or magnetite, of which loadstone, a natural magnet,\r\nis an example, has a metallic, steel lustre and contains 72.4 per cent.\r\nof iron.[44] Most of the ores obtained in Pennsylvania and New York are\r\nmagnetite. The magnetites furnish about one-sixteenth of the output of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n_Carbonate of Iron_, or siderite, occurs in a few localities, the ore\r\nproduced in Ohio being almost wholly of this kind. It contains when\r\npure about forty-eight per cent. of iron.[45] It constitutes less than\r\none per cent. of the output of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Iron pyrites_, or sulphide of iron, sometimes called "fools\' gold," is\r\na very common mineral. It is used in the manufacture of sulphuric acid,\r\nbut is worthless for the production of iron; indeed, the presence of a\r\nvery small percentage of sulphur in iron renders the latter worthless\r\nfor many purposes.\r\n\r\nExtensive deposits of iron are known to exist in very nearly every\r\ncountry in the world, but those which can be advantageously worked are\r\nfew in number. In order to be available, the deposits must be within\r\neasy transporting distance of the people who use it, and likewise within\r\na short distance of the coal used to manufacture it.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons most of the workable deposits of ore are in or near\r\nthe great centres of population in western Europe and the eastern part\r\nof the United States; as a matter of fact, practically all the iron and\r\nsteel of the latter country is produced in the populous centres of the\r\nAtlantic slopes. In most great steel-making districts it is essential to\r\nmix the native ores with special ores brought from a distance, the\r\nlatter being used to give strength and hardness to the resulting metal.\r\nOres from Sweden, and from Juragua, Cuba, are employed for this purpose\r\nin the steel-making establishments of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the past few years the United States has jumped from an insignificant\r\nposition in the production of iron and steel to the first rank among the\r\niron-producing countries. This great advance is due to the fortunate\r\ngeographic position of the iron ore and the coal, and also to the\r\ndiscovery of the Bessemer process of making steel.\r\n\r\nIn general it is more economical to ship the ore to the coal than _vice\r\nversa_. The position of the steel-making plant is largely determined by\r\nthe cost of moving the coke and ore, together with that of getting the\r\nsteel to the place of use. Formerly, iron manufacture in the United\r\nStates was not profitable unless the coal, ore, and limestone[46] were\r\nvery near to one another.\r\n\r\nThese conditions still obtain in the southern Appalachian mineral\r\nfields; the ore and the coal are at no great distance apart, and a great\r\niron-making industry, in which Birmingham and Bessemer form the\r\nprincipal centre, has grown into existence. For the greater part the\r\ncoal is coked; and in this form less than a ton[47] is sufficient to\r\nmake a ton of pig-iron. The smelteries and rolling-mills are built at\r\nplaces where the materials are most conveniently hauled.\r\n\r\nIn the past few years the iron and steel industry which formerly centred\r\nabout the navigable waters at the head of the Ohio River, has undergone\r\na readjustment. Rolling-mills and smelteries exist at Pittsburg and\r\nvicinity, and at Youngstown, New Castle, and other nearby localities,\r\nbut greater steel-making plants have been built along the south shores\r\nof Lakes Michigan and Erie, all of which have come about because of\r\nreasons that are purely geographic.\r\n\r\nImmense deposits of excellent hematite ore in the old mountain-ranges\r\nnear Lake Superior have recently become available. For the greater part\r\nthe ore is very easily quarried. In many instances it is taken out of\r\nthe quarry or pit by steam-shovels which dump it into self-discharging\r\nhopper-cars. Thence the ore is carried on a down grade to the nearest\r\nshipping-port on the lake. There it is dumped into huge bunkers built at\r\nthe docks, and from these it slides down chutes into the holds of the\r\nsteam-barges. A 6,000-ton barge is loaded in less than two hours; a car\r\nis unloaded in a few seconds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOVEMENT OF IRON ORE]\r\n\r\nWater transportation is very cheap compared with railway transportation,\r\neven when the road is built and equipped as an ore-hauling road. The ore\r\nis therefore carried a distance varying from one thousand to one\r\nthousand five hundred miles for less than it could be loaded, on cars\r\nhauled one-tenth that distance by rail, and unloaded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEEL MANUFACTURE--ORE DOCKS]\r\n\r\nAt the south shore of Lake Erie, the ore meets the coke from western\r\nPennsylvania and coal from the Ohio coal-fields, and as a result new\r\ncentres of iron and steel manufacture have grown up along this line of\r\n"least resistance." The ore is unloaded at the docks by means of\r\nmechanical scoops and shovels. So cheaply and quickly is it mined and\r\ntransported that it is delivered to the smelteries at a cost varying\r\nfrom $1.75 to $3.25 per ton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAKE SUPERIOR IRON ORE FIELDS]\r\n\r\nThere are three forms in which iron is used--cast iron, wrought iron,\r\nand steel. Cast iron is crystalline and brittle. The product as it comes\r\nfrom the blast furnace is called pig-iron. In making such commodities as\r\nstoves, and articles that do not require great strength, the pig-iron is\r\nagain melted and cast into moulds which give them the required shape.\r\nCast iron contains from one to five per cent. of carbon.\r\n\r\nWrought iron is malleable, ductile, and very flexible; when pure it is\r\nalso very soft. It is prepared by melting pig-iron in furnaces having\r\nsuch a shape that the molten metal can be stirred or "puddled" in\r\ncontact with the air. By this means the carbon is burnt out, and while\r\nstill at a white heat the pasty iron is kneaded or "wrought," in order\r\nto expel other impurities.\r\n\r\nSteel is a form of iron which is thought to contain a chemical compound\r\nof iron with carbon. It is stronger than iron and finer in grain.\r\nFormerly, steel was made by packing bars of pure iron in charcoal\r\npowder, the whole being enclosed in clay retorts that were heated to\r\nwhiteness for about three days. The product obtained by this method is\r\nknown as cementation steel. It is still used in the manufacture of\r\ncutlery, tools, and fine machinery; it is likewise very expensive. In\r\nsmelting certain ores it is easy to burn out the carbon in open\r\nfurnaces, and "open-hearth" steel is an important factor.\r\n\r\nJust about the beginning of the Civil War, when the railways of the\r\nUnited States were taxed beyond their capacity to carry the produce of\r\nthe country, it became apparent that something more durable than iron\r\nmust be used for rails. The locomotives, then weighing from twenty-five\r\nto thirty-five tons each, were too light to haul the freight offered the\r\nroads; they were also too heavy for the rails, which split at the ends\r\nand frayed at the edges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRON AND STEEL]\r\n\r\nThe Bessemer process of making steel was the result of the demand for a\r\nbetter and a cheaper method. By this process, the iron is put into a\r\n"converter" along with certain Swedish or Cuban ores to give the product\r\nhardness. A hot blast is then forced into the converter which not only\r\nmelts the mass but burns out the excess of carbon as well. The color of\r\nthe flame indicates the moment when the conversion to steel is\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, before the establishment of the Bessemer process, steel\r\ncommanded a price of about one hundred and twenty-five dollars per ton;\r\nat the beginning of the twentieth century steel billets were about\r\neighteen dollars per ton. In western Europe and the United States there\r\nare used about three hundred pounds of iron and steel per capita; in\r\nSouth America the rate of consumption is about fifteen pounds; in Asia\r\n(Japan excepted) it is probably less than three pounds.\r\n\r\nThe economic results of low-priced steel are very far-reaching. Steam\r\nboilers of steel carry a pressure of more than two hundred and fifty\r\npounds to each square inch of surface--about four times as great as in\r\nthe iron boilers formerly used. Locomotives of eighty tons draw the fast\r\npassenger trains at a speed of sixty miles an hour. Ponderous\r\ncompounding engines weighing one hundred and twenty tons haul ninety or\r\nmore steel freight cars that carry each a load of 100,000 pounds. The\r\niron rails formerly in use weighed about forty pounds per yard; now\r\nsteel rails of one hundred pounds per yard are employed on most trunk\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nIn the large commercial buildings steel girders have entirely supplanted\r\ntimber, while in nearly all modern buildings of more than six stories in\r\nheight, the frame is constructed of Bessemer steel. Indeed, a\r\nsteel-framed building of twenty-five stories has greater stability than\r\na brick or stone building of six. Such a structure as the "Flatiron\r\nBuilding" in New York or the Masonic Temple in Chicago would have been\r\nimpossible without Bessemer steel.\r\n\r\nIn ocean commerce cheap steel has worked even a greater revolution. In\r\n1860, a vessel of 4,000 tons displacement was thought to be almost up to\r\nthe limit. The Oceanic of the White Star Line has a displacement of\r\nabout twenty-eight thousand five hundred tons. This is nearly equalled\r\nby the measurement of half a dozen other liners, and is exceeded by the\r\nfreighters built by Mr. J.J. Hill for the China trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a copyrighted photograph by C.L.

It is mentioned\r\nby the ancient profane as well as by sacred writers. Pictorial\r\nrepresentations of fusing and working the metal are sculptured on early\r\nEgyptian tombs, and beautiful gold ornaments have been found that were\r\nmade by the prehistoric peoples who once occupied ancient Etruria, in\r\nItaly. Columbus found gold ornaments in the possession of the aboriginal\r\nAmericans. The Incas of Peru and the Aztecs of Mexico possessed large\r\nquantities of gold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEACHING (CYANIDE) TANKS DISSOLVING THE GOLD FROM THE\r\nROASTED ORE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STOPING OUT A TUNNEL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF MILL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD MINING]\r\n\r\nGold is one of the most widely diffused of metals. Traces of it are\r\nfound in practically all igneous and most sedimentary rocks. It occurs\r\nin sea-water, and quite frequently in beach-sands. Traces of it are also\r\nusually to be found in alluvial deposits and in the soils of most\r\nmountain-folds. In spite of its wide diffusion, however, all the gold\r\nthat has been mined could be stored readily in the vaults of any large\r\nNew York bank.\r\n\r\nIn all probability most of the gold now in use has been deposited by\r\nsolution in quartz veins, the latter usually filling seams and crevices\r\nin granitic or volcanic rocks. Quartz veins seldom yield very great\r\nreturns, but they furnish a steady supply of the metal. The rock must be\r\nmined, hoisted to the surface, and crushed. The gold is then dissolved\r\nby quicksilver (forming an amalgam from which the quicksilver is removed\r\nby heat), by potassium cyanide solution, or by chlorine solution.\r\n\r\nIn many instances the quartz veins have been broken and weathered by\r\nnatural forces. In such cases the gold is usually carried off by swiftly\r\nrunning water and deposited in the channel lower down. In this way\r\n"placer" deposits of gold occur. Placer deposits are sometimes very\r\nrich, but they are quickly exhausted. The first gold discovered in\r\nCalifornia was placer gold.\r\n\r\nNearly all the gold mined in the United States has come from the western\r\nhighlands. In 1900, Colorado, California, South Dakota (Black Hills),\r\nMontana, and Alaska yielded about seven-eighths of the entire product.\r\nThe placer mines of Alaska are confined mainly to the beach-sands and\r\nthe tributaries of Yukon River. Since 1849 the average annual yield of\r\ngold in the United States is about forty-three million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe Guinea coast of Africa, Australia, California, the Transvaal of\r\nSouth Africa, and Venezuela have each stood at the front in the\r\nproduction of gold. The aggregate annual production of the world has\r\nincreased from one hundred and sixty million dollars in 1853 to more\r\nthan three hundred million dollars in 1900.\r\n\r\nA considerable part of the gold product is used in gilding\r\npicture-frames, book-titles, sign-letters, porcelain, and ornamental\r\nbrass work. Practically, all of this is lost, and in the United States\r\nalone the loss aggregates about fifteen million dollars yearly. The\r\nabrasion and unavoidable wear of gold coin is another great source of\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nAn enormous amount is used in the manufacture of jewelry, most of which\r\nis used over and over again. By far the greater part, however, is used\r\nas a commercial medium of exchange--that is, as coin. For this purpose\r\nits employment is wellnigh universal; and indeed this has been its chief\r\nuse since the beginning of written history. Gold coin of the United\r\nStates is 900 fine, that is, 900 parts of every thousand is pure gold;\r\ngold coin of Great Britain is 916-2/3 fine. In each case a small amount\r\nof silver, or silver and copper, is added to give the coin the requisite\r\nhardness. The coining of gold, and also other metals, is a government\r\nmonopoly in every civilized country.\r\n\r\nThe fiat value of gold throughout the commercial world is the equivalent\r\nof $20.6718 per troy ounce of fine metal; an eagle weighs, therefore,\r\n2580 grains. The real value, however, is reckoned by a different and a\r\nmore accurate standard, namely, the labor of man, and this, the\r\nsporadic finds of placer gold excepted, has not changed much in two\r\nthousand years or more. The increased production has scarcely equalled\r\nthe demand for the metal; moreover, the longer a mine is worked the\r\ngreater becomes the expense of its operation. Improved processes for the\r\nextraction of gold have not created any surplus of gold; indeed, the\r\nsupply is not equal to the demand; and this fact keeps the metal\r\npractically at a fixed value.\r\n\r\n=Silver.=--Silver is about as widely diffused as is gold, but it is more\r\nplentiful. It is found sparingly in most of the older rocks and also in\r\nsea-water. It was used by the Greeks for coinage more than eight hundred\r\nyears before the Christian era, and was known to the Jewish people in\r\nvery early times. According to the writer of the Book of Kings (1 Kings\r\nx. 21), "It was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon," but\r\nTacitus declares that in ancient Germany silver was even more valuable\r\nthan gold. The mines of Laureion (Laurium) gave the Greek state of\r\nAttica its chief power, and the failure of the mines marked the\r\nbeginning of Athenian decline.\r\n\r\nSilver is rarely found in a metallic state. For the greater part it\r\noccurs combined with chlorine ("horn silver"), or with sulphur ("silver\r\nglance"), or in combination with antimony and sulphur ("ruby ore"). The\r\nranges of the western highland region of the American continent yield\r\nmost of the present supply. The mines of Colorado, Montana, Utah, and\r\nIdaho produce about six-sevenths of the yield in the United States,\r\nwhich in 1900 was 74,500,000 ounces. In Europe the Hartz Mountains have\r\nbeen famous for silver for several centuries.\r\n\r\nAbout four-fifths of the silver bullion is used in the arts, most of it\r\nbeing manufactured into ornaments or into table-service called "plate."\r\nA considerable amount is used in photography, certain silver salts,\r\nespecially the chloride and the bromide, changing color by exposure to\r\nthe light. The remaining part of the silver output is made into coin.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of silver and gold has fluctuated much in the history of\r\ncivilization. In the United States the value of an ounce of fine silver\r\nis fixed at $1.2929, thereby making the ratio 16 to 1. The silver\r\ndollars, 900 fine, were coined on this basis, weighing 412.5 grains.\r\nWith the tremendous output of the silver mines between 1870 and 1880 the\r\nprice of silver fell to such an extent that, in time, most countries\r\nlimited the amount of coinage or demonetized it altogether. In the\r\nUnited States the purchase of silver bullion for coinage has been\r\npractically suspended, and the silver purchased is bought at the bullion\r\nvalue--about fifty cents per troy ounce in 1900. In Japan the ratio has\r\nbeen officially fixed at 32 to 1.\r\n\r\n=Copper.=--Copper is probably the oldest metal known that has been used in\r\nmaking tools. An alloy of copper and tin, hard enough to cut and dress\r\nstone, succeeded the use of flint and jade, and its employment became so\r\ngeneral as to give the name "bronze" to the age following that\r\ncharacterized by the use of stone implements.\r\n\r\nCopper is very widely distributed. It occurs in quantities that pay for\r\nmining in pretty nearly every country in the world. The rise of Egypt as\r\na commercial power was due to the fact that the Egyptians controlled the\r\nworld\'s trade in that metal, and it is highly probable that the\r\nconquests of Cyprus at various times were chiefly for the possession of\r\nthe copper mines of Mount Olympus.\r\n\r\nAt the present time there are several great centres of production which\r\nyield most of the metal used. These are the Rocky Mountain region,\r\nincluding Mexico; the Lake Superior region of the United States; the\r\nAndean region, including Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Bolivia; the\r\nIberian region, consisting of Spain and Portugal; and the Hartz\r\nMountain region of Germany. In 1900 they produced about four hundred and\r\nfifty thousand tons, of which two hundred and eighty thousand were mined\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nMontana, the Lake Superior mines, and Arizona are the most productive\r\nregions of the United States, and the mines of these three localities\r\nyield more than half the world\'s product. Of these mines the Calumet and\r\nHecla of the Lake Superior region is the most famous. It was discovered\r\nby Jesuit explorers about 1660, but was not worked until 1845. It is one\r\nof the most productive mines in the world, its yearly output averaging\r\nfifty million tons.\r\n\r\nThe export trade in copper is very important, amounting at the close of\r\nthe past century to about one hundred and seventy thousand short tons.\r\nOf this amount, half goes to Germany (most of it through ports of the\r\nNetherlands), and one-fifth each to France and Great Britain. The market\r\nprice to the consumer during the ten years closing the century averaged\r\nabout sixteen cents per pound. Most of the product is exported from New\r\nYork and Baltimore. The head-quarters of the great copper-mining\r\ncompanies of America are at Boston. The imports of raw ores and partly\r\nreduced ores called "regulus," come mainly from Mexico to New York and\r\nBaltimore, and from Mexico and Japan to Puget Sound ports. The most\r\nimportant American refineries are at New York and Baltimore.\r\n\r\nA part of the copper is mixed with zinc to form brass, an alloy much\r\nused in light machinery. A considerable quantity is rolled into sheets\r\nto sheath building fronts and the iron hulls of vessels. By far the\r\ngreater part, however, is drawn into wire for carrying electricity, and\r\nfor this purpose it is surpassed by silver alone. The decrease in the\r\nprice of copper in the past few years is due, not to a falling off in\r\nthe demand, but to methods of reducing the ores and transporting the\r\nproduct more economically.\r\n\r\n=Aluminium.=--Aluminium is the base of clay, this mineral being its oxide.\r\nIt occurs in the various feldspars and feldspathic rocks, and in mica.\r\nThe expense of extracting the metal from these minerals has been so\r\ngreat as to prohibit its commercial use. In 1870 there were probably\r\nless than twenty pounds of the metal in existence, and it was to be\r\nfound only as a curiosity in the chemical laboratories. The discovery\r\nthat the metal could be extracted cheaply from cryolite, a mineral with\r\nan aluminium base, obtained from Ivigtut, Greenland, led to a sparing\r\nuse of the metal in the economic arts.\r\n\r\nThe chief step in the production of the metal dates from the time that\r\nthe mineral _bauxite_, a hydroxide of aluminium and iron, was decomposed\r\nin the electric furnace. The process has been repeatedly improved, and\r\nunder the patents covered by the Hall process the crude metal is now\r\nproduced at a market price of about eighteen cents per pound. The entire\r\nproduction of the United States is controlled by the Pittsburg Reduction\r\nCompany, which also manufactures much of the commercial product of\r\nEngland. The competitor of the Pittsburg Reduction Company is an\r\nestablishment in Germany, near Bremen.\r\n\r\nAluminium does not corrode; it is easily rolled, drawn, or cast; and,\r\nbulk for bulk, it is less than one-third as heavy as copper. Because of\r\nthese properties it has a great and constantly growing economic value.\r\nBecause of its greater size, a pound of aluminium wire will carry a\r\ngreater electric current than a pound of copper wire of the same length.\r\nIt therefore has an increasing use as a conductor of electricity.\r\n\r\nBauxite, the mineral from which the metal is now chiefly extracted, is\r\nobtained in two localities. One extends through Georgia and Alabama;\r\nthe other is in Arkansas.\r\n\r\n=Lead.=--Lead is neither so abundant nor so widely diffused as iron,\r\ncopper, and the precious metals, but the supply is fully equal to the\r\ndemand. Lead ores, mainly galena or lead sulphide, occur abundantly in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, Colorado, Idaho, and Utah, producing more than half\r\nthe total output of the United States. In these localities, in Mexico,\r\nand in the Andean states of South America it is used mainly in the\r\nsmelting of silver ores.\r\n\r\nMetallic lead is used largely in the manufacture of water-pipes, and for\r\nthis purpose it must be very nearly pure. It is also rolled into sheets\r\nto be used as lining for water-tanks. The fact that the edges of\r\nsheet-lead and the ends of pipes may be readily joined with solder gives\r\nto lead a great part of its economic value. Alloyed with arsenic it is\r\nused in making shot; alloyed with antimony it forms type metal; alloyed\r\nwith tin it forms pewter and solder.\r\n\r\nThe greater part, however, is manufactured into the carbonate or "white"\r\nlead that is used as a pigment, or paint. Red lead, an oxide, is a\r\npigment; litharge, also an oxide, is used for glazing the cheaper kinds\r\nof pottery. About two hundred and thirty thousand tons of lead are\r\nproduced in the United States and one-half as much is imported--mainly\r\nfrom Mexico and Canada. The linotype machines, now used in all large\r\nprinting establishments, have increased the demand for lead.\r\n\r\n=Other Metals.=--Most of the remaining economic metals occur in small\r\nquantities as compared with iron, copper, gold, and silver. Some of\r\nthem, however, are highly important from the fact that in various\r\nindustrial processes no substitutes for them are known.\r\n\r\n_Quicksilver_, or _mercury_, is the only industrial metal that at\r\nordinary temperatures is a liquid. It is the base of the substance\r\ncalomel, a chloride, and corrosive sublimate, a dichloride, both of\r\nwhich are employed as medicines. It is essential in the manufacture of\r\nthermometers and barometers, but is used chiefly, however, as a solvent\r\nof gold, which it separates from the finely powdered ore by solution or\r\namalgamation. Quicksilver occurs in the mineral cinnabar, a sulphide.\r\n\r\nNearly one-half the world\'s product comes from California. The New\r\nAlmaden mines of Santa Clara County produce over five thousand flasks\r\n(each seventy-six and one-half pounds net); those of Napa County nearly\r\nnine thousand flasks; the mines of the whole State yield about\r\ntwenty-six thousand flasks, valued at $1,200,000. Almaden, Spain, and\r\nIdria, Austria, produce nearly all the rest of the output. An average of\r\nabout fifteen thousand flasks are exported from San Francisco, mainly to\r\nthe mines of Mexico, and Central and South America.\r\n\r\n_Tin_ is about the only metal of industrial value whose ores are not\r\nfound in paying quantities in the United States. Small quantities occur\r\nin San Bernardino County, Cal., and in the vicinity of Bering Strait,\r\nAlaska, but it is doubtful if either will ever pay for development.\r\nAbout three-fifths of the world\'s product comes from the Straits\r\nSettlements on the Malay Peninsula; the nearby islands of Banca and\r\nBilliton also yield a considerable quantity.\r\n\r\nThe mines of Cornwall, England, have been worked for two thousand years\r\nand were probably the source of the tin that made the "bronze age." The\r\nUnited States imports yearly about twenty million dollars worth of tin,\r\nabout half of which comes from the Straits Settlements. This is used\r\nalmost wholly for the manufacture of tin plate[48]--that is, sheet-iron\r\ncoated with tin. Much of the block tin imported from Great Britain is\r\nreturned there in the form of tin plate, being manufactured in the\r\nUnited States much more economically than in Europe.\r\n\r\n_Nickel_ occurs in New Caledonia, in Canada, and in the State of\r\nMissouri. It is used in the manufacture of small coins and for plating\r\niron and steel. It is an essential in the metal known as "nickel steel"\r\nwhich is now generally used in armor-plate and propeller-shafts, about\r\nfour per cent. of nickel being added to the steel. Most of the product\r\nused in the United States is imported from Canada.\r\n\r\n_Manganese_, a metal resembling iron, occurs in Russia, Brazil, and\r\nCuba, Russia producing about half the total output. It is used mainly to\r\ngive hardness to steel. The propeller-blades of large steamships are\r\nusually made of manganese bronze. The building of war-ships in the\r\nUnited States during the past few years has led to the extensive use of\r\nmanganese for armor-plate, and manganese ores to the amount of more than\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand tons were imported in 1900. More than\r\none-half of this came from Russia; most of the remaining half from\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\n_Zinc_ is abundant in nearly every part of the world. In the United\r\nStates the best known mines are in the Galena-Joplin District, in\r\nMissouri and Kansas, which produce about two-thirds of the home\r\nproduct--mainly from the ore _blende_, a sulphide. There are also\r\nextensive zinc-mining operations in Illinois, New Jersey, and\r\nPennsylvania. The lower Rhine District, Great Britain, and Silesia are\r\nthe chief European sources. Sheet-zinc is found in nearly every dwelling\r\nin the United States, and zinc-coated or "galvanized" iron has become a\r\ndomestic necessity. Zinc-white is extensively used as a pigment. About\r\ntwo hundred and fifty million pounds of crude zinc, or "spelter," are\r\nproduced in the United States; forty-five million pounds were exported\r\nin 1900, mainly to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat are the qualities that make iron the most valuable of metals?\r\n\r\nIn what ways does commerce depend on iron and steel?\r\n\r\nWhat substances are used for food, clothing, or domestic purposes that\r\nare not manufactured by the aid of iron?\r\n\r\nIngot or billet steel is rated at about one cent per pound; the\r\nhair-springs of watches are worth several thousand dollars per pound;\r\nwhat makes the difference in their value?\r\n\r\nWhat are the qualities that give to gold its value?\r\n\r\nWould all the gold mined in the United States pay the national debt at\r\nthe end of the Civil War?\r\n\r\nWhat causes have led to the increasing price of copper during the past\r\nfew years?\r\n\r\nWhat is the market price each of copper, silver, steel rails, and\r\naluminium to-day?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR STUDY AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nObtain specimens of the following iron ores: Hematite, brown hematite,\r\nmagnetite, carbonate, and pyrites.

In a few instances the name\r\nis given to certain mineral salts, such as sugar of lead, but in the\r\nmain the sugars are plant products very similar in chemical structure to\r\nthe starches. They are very closely connected with plant growth, and\r\neven in animal life, starchy substances are changed to sugar in the\r\nprocess of digestion. Although sugar does not sustain life, it is\r\nnecessary as an adjunct to other food-stuffs, and it is probably\r\nconsumed by a greater number of people than any other food-stuffs except\r\nstarch and water.\r\n\r\nThree kinds of sugar are found in commerce, namely--_cane_-sugar,\r\n_grape_-sugar, and _milk_-sugar. Cane-sugar occurs in the sap of the\r\nsugar-cane, sorghum-cane, certain of the palms, and the juice of the\r\nbeet. Grape-sugar is the sweet principle of most fruits and of honey.\r\nSugar of milk occurs in milk, and in several kinds of nuts.\r\n\r\n=Sugar-Cane Sugar.=--Cane-sugar is so called because until recently it was\r\nderived almost wholly from the sap of the sugar-cane (_Saccharum\r\nofficinarum_). The plant belongs to the grass family and much resembles\r\nmaize before the latter has matured. It is thought to be native to Asia,\r\nbut it is now cultivated in nearly all tropical countries in the world.\r\n\r\nPractically every moist tropical region in the world, the basins of the\r\nKongo and Amazon Rivers excepted, is a cane-sugar-producing region. As\r\na rule it is grown in the states under native rule for home consumption,\r\nand in European colonial possessions for commercial purposes. India and\r\nChina are probably the foremost in the production of sugar-cane sugar,\r\nbut the product is not exported. Cuba, Java, the Gulf coast of the\r\nUnited States, Mauritius, the Philippine and the Hawaiian Islands\r\nproduce the most of the supply that enters into commerce.\r\n\r\n=Beet-Sugar.=--During the last quarter of the nineteenth century the\r\ndemands for sugar increased so greatly that it became necessary either\r\nto raise the price of the commodity, or else to utilize some plant other\r\nthan the sugar-cane as a source. After a few years of experimental work\r\nit was found that sugar could be readily extracted from the juice of the\r\ncommon beet (_Beta vulgaris_). Several varieties of this plant have been\r\nimproved and are now very largely cultivated for the purpose. Beet-sugar\r\nand cane-sugar are identical.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the beet-sugar of commerce comes from northwestern Europe;\r\nGermany leads with nearly one-third the world\'s product; France,\r\nAustria, and Russia follow, each producing about one-sixth. A small\r\namount is produced in the United States--mainly in California and\r\nMichigan. The area of production, however, is increasing.\r\n\r\n=Other Cane-Sugars.=--Maple-sugar is derived from the sap of several\r\nspecies of maple-trees occurring mainly in the northeastern United\r\nStates and in Canada. The sap is obtained by tapping the trees in early\r\nspring, a single tree often yielding several gallons. The value of\r\nmaple-sugar lies mainly in its pleasant flavor. It is used partly as a\r\nconfection, but in the main as a sirup. A very large part of the\r\nmaple-sirup and not a little of the sugar is artificial, consisting of\r\nordinary sugar colored with caramel and flavored with an extract\r\nprepared from the maple-tree.\r\n\r\nSorghum-sugar is obtained from a cane known as Chinese grass, or Chinese\r\nmillet. It has been introduced into the United States from southeastern\r\nAsia and Japan. The sorghum-cane grows well in the temperate zone, and\r\nits cultivation in the Mississippi Valley States has been successful.\r\nThe sugar is not easily crystallizable, however, and it is usually made\r\ninto table-sirup.\r\n\r\nMaguey-sugar is derived from the sap of the maguey-plant (_Agave\r\nAmericana_). It is much used in Mexico and the Central American states.\r\nThe method of manufacture is very crude and the product is not exported.\r\nPalm-sugar is obtained from the sap of several species of palm growing\r\nin India and Africa.\r\n\r\n=Sugar Manufacture.=--Sugar manufacture includes three\r\nprocesses--expressing the sap, evaporating, and refining. The first two\r\nare carried on at or near the plantations; the last is an affair\r\nrequiring an immense capital and a most elaborately organized plant. The\r\nrefining is done mainly in the great centres of population at places\r\nmost convenient for transportation. The raw sugar may travel five or ten\r\nthousand miles to reach the refinery; the refined product rarely travels\r\nmore than a thousand miles.\r\n\r\nAfter it has been cut and stripped of its leaves the sugar-cane is\r\ncrushed between powerful rollers in order to express the juice. The\r\nsugar-beet is rasped or ground to a pulp and then subjected to great\r\npressure. The expressed juice contains about ten or twelve per cent. of\r\nsugar. In some factories the beet, or the cane, is cut into thin slices\r\nand thrown into water, the juice being extracted by the solvent\r\nproperties of the latter. This is known as the "diffusion" process.\r\n\r\nThe juice is first strained or filtered under pressure in order to\r\nremove all foreign matter and similar impurities. It is then clarified\r\nby adding slacked lime, at the same time heating the liquid nearly to\r\nthe boiling point and skimming off the impurities that rise to the\r\nsurface. The purified juice is then boiled rapidly in vacuum pans until\r\nit is greatly concentrated.\r\n\r\nWhen the proper degree of concentration is reached, the liquid is\r\nquickly run off into shallow pans, in which most of it immediately\r\ncrystallizes. The crystalline portion forms the _raw sugar_ of commerce;\r\nthe remaining part is molasses. The whole mass is then shovelled into a\r\ncentrifugal machine which in a few minutes separates the two products.\r\n\r\nIn purchasing raw sugar, the refiner was formerly at a loss to know just\r\nhow much pure sugar could be made from a given weight of the raw sugar.\r\nIn order to aid in making a correct determination, the Dutch government\r\nformerly prepared sixteen samples put up in glass flasks and sealed.\r\nThese samples varied in color according to the amount of pure sugar\r\ncontained. The pure solution was known in commerce as No. 16 Dutch\r\nstandard, and this was generally taken all over the world as the\r\nstandard of pure sugar. Within recent years the polariscope, an optical\r\ninstrument that determines the percentage of sugar by means of polarized\r\nlight, has largely replaced the Dutch standard.\r\n\r\nThe refineries, as a rule, are built with reference to a minimum\r\nhandling and transportation of the raw product. The cane-sugar\r\nrefineries are mainly at the great seaports, where the raw sugar does\r\nnot pay railway transportation. The beet-sugar refineries are in the\r\nmidst of the beet-growing districts. So nearly perfect and economically\r\nmanaged are these processes, that raw sugar imported from Europe or\r\nfrom the West Indies, at a cost of from two and a quarter to two and a\r\nhalf cents per pound, is refined and sold at retail at about five cents.\r\n\r\nThe margin of profit is so very close, however, that in the United\r\nStates, as well as most European states, the sugar industry is protected\r\nby government enactments. In the United States imported raw sugar pays a\r\ntariff in order to protect the cane-sugar industry of the Gulf coast and\r\nthe beet-sugar grower of the Western States. The duty at the close of\r\nthe nineteenth century was about 1.66 cents per pound; or, if the sugar\r\ncame from a foreign country paying a bounty on sugar exported, an\r\nadditional countervailing duty equal to the bounty was also charged.\r\n\r\nIn the various states of western Europe the beet-sugar industry is\r\ngoverned by a cartel or agreement among the states, which makes the\r\nwhole business a gigantic combination arrayed against the tropical sugar\r\ninterests. In general, the government of each state pays a bounty on\r\nevery pound of beet-sugar exported. The real effect of the export bounty\r\nis about the same as the imposition of a tax on the sugar purchased for\r\nconsumption at home.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of the entire sugar product are made from the beet, at an\r\naverage cost of about 2.5 cents a pound. In the tropical islands the\r\nyield of cane-sugar per acre is about double that of beet-sugar and it\r\nis produced for about five dollars less per ton. This difference is in\r\npart offset by the fact that the raw cane-sugar must pay transportation\r\nfor a long distance to the place of consumption, and in part by the\r\ngovernment bounties paid on the beet product.\r\n\r\nBoth the political and the economic effects of beet sugar-making have\r\nbeen far-reaching. In Germany the agricultural interests of the country\r\nhave been completely reorganized. The uncertain profits of cereal\r\nfood-stuffs have given place to the sure profits of beet-sugar\r\ncultivation, with the result that the income of the Germans has been\r\nenormously increased. In the other lowland countries of western Europe\r\nthe venture has been equally successful. Even the Netherlands has\r\nprofited by it.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Spain, the result of beet-sugar cultivation was\r\ndisastrous. The price of cane-sugar in Cuba and the Philippine Islands\r\nfell to such a low point that the islands could not pay the taxes\r\nimposed by the mother country. Instead of lowering the taxes and\r\nadjusting affairs to the changed conditions, the Spaniards drove the\r\nislands into rebellion, and the latter finally resulted in war with the\r\nUnited States, and the loss of the colonies. Great Britain wisely\r\nadjusted her colonial affairs to the changed conditions, but the British\r\ncolonies suffered greatly from beet-sugar competition.\r\n\r\n=Production and Consumption.=--The production and consumption of sugar\r\nincreased about sevenfold during the latter half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the increase being due very largely to the decreased price.\r\nThus, in 1850, white (loaf) sugar was a luxury, retailing at about\r\ntwenty cents per pound; in 1870 the wholesale price of pure granulated\r\nsugar was fourteen cents; in 1902 it was not quite five cents.\r\n\r\nAlthough the tropical countries are greatly handicapped by the political\r\nlegislation of the European states, they cannot supply the amount of\r\nsugar required, unless the area of production be greatly extended. It is\r\nalso certain that without governmental protection, sugar growing in the\r\ntemperate zone cannot compete with that of the tropical countries.\r\n\r\nOf the eight million tons of sugar yearly consumed, two-thirds are\r\nbeet-sugar. The annual consumption per capita is about ninety pounds in\r\nGreat Britain, seventy pounds in the United States, and not far from\r\nthirty-five pounds in Germany and France. In Russia and the eastern\r\nEuropean countries it is less than fifteen pounds.\r\n\r\n=Molasses.=--The molasses of commerce is the uncrystallizable sugar that\r\nis left in the vacuum pans at the close of the process of evaporation.\r\nThe molasses formerly known as "sugar house" is a filthy product that\r\nnowadays is scarcely used, except in the manufacture of rum. The color\r\nof molasses is due mainly to the presence of "caramel" or half-charred\r\nsugar; it cannot be wholly removed by any ordinary clarifying process.\r\n\r\nPurified molasses is usually known as "sirup," and much of it is made by\r\nboiling a solution of raw sugar to the proper degree of concentration. A\r\nconsiderable part is made from the sap of the sorghum-cane, and probably\r\na larger quantity consists of glucose solution colored with caramel.\r\nMaple-sirup, formerly a solution of maple-sugar, is now very largely\r\nmade from raw cane-sugar clarified and artificially flavored.\r\n\r\n=Glucose.=--Glucose, or grape-sugar, is the natural sugar of the grape and\r\nmost small fruits. Honey is a nearly pure, concentrated solution of\r\nglucose. Grape-sugar has, roughly, about three-fifths the sweetening\r\npower of cane-sugar. Natural grape-sugar is too expensive for ordinary\r\ncommercial use; the commercial product, on the other hand, is\r\nartificial, and is made mainly from cornstarch.\r\n\r\nGlucose is employed in the cheaper kinds of confectionery in the United\r\nStates; most of it, however, is exported to Great Britain, the annual\r\nproduct being worth about four million dollars. From the fact that it\r\ncan be made more economically from corn than from any other grain,\r\npractically all the glucose is made in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens that the prices of sugar and tin-plate rise and\r\nfall together; show how the fruit-crop may cause this fluctuation.\r\n\r\nWhich of the possessions of the United States are adaptable for\r\ncane-sugar?--for beet-sugar?\r\n\r\nIn what ways has the manufacture of sugar brought about international\r\ncomplications?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by "Dutch Standard" tests?--by polariscope tests?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR REFERENCE AND STUDY\r\n\r\nObtain specimens of rock candy, granulated sugar, raw sugar, and\r\ncaramel; observe each carefully with a magnifying glass and note the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nWorld\'s Sugar Production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nFORESTS AND FOREST PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside the food-stuffs, probably no other material is more generally\r\nused by human beings than the products of the forests. More people are\r\nsheltered by wooden dwellings than by those of brick or stone, and more\r\npeople are warmed by wood fires than by coal. Even in steam-making a\r\nconsiderable power is still produced by the use of wood for fuel.\r\n\r\nNeither stone nor metal can wholly take the place of wood as a building\r\nmaterial; indeed, for interior fittings, finishings, and furniture, no\r\nartificial substitute has yet been found that is acceptable. For such\r\npurposes it is carried to the interior of continents and transported\r\nacross the oceans; and although the cost has enormously increased, the\r\ndemand has scarcely fallen off.\r\n\r\n=Forest Areas.=--The great belts of forests girdle the land surface of the\r\nearth. A zone of tropical forest forms a broad belt on each side of the\r\nequator, but mainly north of it. This forest includes most of the\r\nornamental woods, such as mahogany, ebony, rosewood, sandal-wood, etc.\r\nIt also includes the most useful teak as well as the rubber-tree and the\r\ncinchona. Another forest belt in the north temperate zone is situated\r\nmainly between the thirty-fifth and fiftieth parallels. It traverses\r\nmiddle and northern Europe and the northern United States.\r\n\r\nThis forest contains the various species of pine, cedar, and other\r\nconifers, the oaks, maples, elms, birches, etc. Most of the forests of\r\nwestern Europe have been greatly depleted, though those of Norway and\r\nSweden are still productive. The forests of the United States, extending\r\nfrom Maine to Dakota, have been so wellnigh exhausted that by 1950 only\r\na very little good lumber-making timber will be left.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of forests has been most wasteful. When a forest-covered\r\nregion is settled, a large area is burnt off in order to clear the land\r\nfor cultivation. In many instances the fires are never fully\r\nextinguished until the forest disappears. The timber of the United\r\nStates has been depleted not only by frequent fires but in various other\r\nways. The lumbermen take the best trees and these are cut into\r\nbuilding-lumber. The railways follow the lumbermen, cutting out\r\neverything suitable for ties. The paper-makers vie with the tie-cutters,\r\nand what is left is the plunder of the charcoal-burner.\r\n\r\n=Forestry.=--In most of Europe the care of the remaining forests is\r\nusually a government charge. Only a certain number of mature trees may\r\nbe removed each year, and many are planted for each one removed--in the\r\naggregate, several million each year. In the United States, where the\r\nvalue of the growing timber destroyed by fire each year nearly equals\r\nthe national debt, not very much has been done to either check the\r\nravage or to reforest the denuded areas. Many of the States, however,\r\nencourage tree-planting. In several, Arbor Day is a holiday provided by\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe general Government has established timber preserves in several\r\nlocalities in the West. The State of New York has converted the whole\r\nAdirondack region into a great preserve. Forest wardens and guards are\r\nemployed both to keep fires in check and to prevent the ravages of\r\ntimber thieves; excepting the State preserves however, the means of\r\nprevention are inadequate for either purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LUMBER INDUSTRY--A LOG JAM]\r\n\r\nTo be valuable for lumber of the best quality, a forest tree must be\r\n"clear"; that is, it must be free from knots at least fifteen feet from\r\nthe ground. In the case of pines and cedars, the clear part of the trunk\r\nmust have a greater length. To produce such conditions, the trees must\r\ngrow thickly together, in order that the lower branches may not mature.\r\n\r\nThe growth of trees thus set is very slow. Isolated pine-trees will\r\nreach the size large enough for cutting in about fifty years, but the\r\nlumber will be practically worthless because of the knots. On the other\r\nhand, pine forests with the trees so thickly set as to make a clear,\r\nmerchantable lumber require at least a century for maturity.[49] Oak\r\nforests require a much greater period.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the forest growths of the United States are found in the\r\nareas characterized by sandy and gravelly soils. Thus, the glaciated\r\nregion of the United States and Canada for the greater part is\r\nforest-covered. The sand barrens along the Atlantic coast usually are\r\nforest areas. The older bottom-lands of most rivers are often\r\nforest-covered, especially when their soil is coarse and sandy.\r\n\r\nThere are large areas, however, in both the United States and Europe,\r\nthat are treeless. In some instances this condition, without doubt,\r\nresulted from the fires that annually burnt the grass. With the\r\ncessation of the prairie fires, forest growths have steadily increased.\r\n\r\nIn other instances these areas are treeless because the seeds of trees\r\nhave never been planted there. The high plains at the eastern base of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains are an example. This region is deficient in the\r\nmoisture required to give young trees the vigorous start that will\r\ncarry them to maturity. Moreover, the westerly winds and the streams of\r\nthis region come from localities also deficient in forestry, and there\r\nare therefore no seeds to be carried.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the distribution of forests is effected by the winds and by\r\nmoving water. The prevailing westerly winds of the temperate zones have\r\ncarried many species eastward and have extended the forest areas in that\r\ndirection. Freshets, floods, and overflows have been even more active in\r\ncarrying seeds, sprouts, and even trees into new territories. Waves and\r\ncurrents have likewise played a similar part. Wherever the soil of the\r\nregion into which the species have been carried is moist and nutritious,\r\nthe forest growth has usually extended.\r\n\r\n=The Pine Family.=--The pine family includes the various species of pine,\r\ntamarack, spruce, hemlock, fir, juniper, larch, cypress, and cedar. A\r\nfew members of the family thrive in the warmer parts of the temperate\r\nzone, but for the greater part they flourish between the fortieth and\r\nsixtieth parallels. Most of the species found in low latitudes are\r\nmountain-trees. They constitute the greater part of the American and\r\nRussian forests. The American pine forest is thought to be the largest\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nThe _white pine_ (_Pinus strobus_) is the most valuable member of the\r\nfamily. Its value is due in part to the fact that the wood is soft,\r\nclear, and easily worked, and in part to the accessibility of the\r\nforests. Not much inroad has yet been made upon the great Russian\r\nforest, owing to the fact that the timber is too far away from seaports\r\nand water transportation. Rough lumber becomes too expensive for use\r\nwhen transported by land, but it will stand the expense of shipment by\r\nwater many miles.\r\n\r\nThe _Georgia_ or _long-leafed pine_ (_Pinus palustris_) is also\r\ncommonly called _pitch pine_, _turpentine pine_, and _southern pine_; it\r\ngrows chiefly along the south Atlantic coast and in the northern\r\ncounties of Georgia. It is harder than white pine and makes excellent\r\nflooring.\r\n\r\nThe _sugar pine_ (_Pinus lambertiana_) occurs mainly in Oregon and\r\nCalifornia. The grain is fine and soft and the trees reach a large\r\ngirth.\r\n\r\nThe _loblolly pine_ (_Pinus t\xc3\xa6da_) has a considerably larger area than\r\nthe Georgia pine, extending into Indian Territory. The _short-leaf pine_\r\n(_Pinus echinata_) occurs in small areas from New York to the Gulf of\r\nMexico, and across to Missouri; it is the Chattahoochee pine of Florida.\r\nThe _pitch pine_ (_Pinus rigida_) occurs in various areas mainly north\r\nof the Ohio River and west of the prairies. The lumber cut annually from\r\nthese pines aggregates about thirty billion feet.\r\n\r\nThe common _white cedar_ (_Cham\xc3\xa6cyparis thyoides_) occurs along the\r\nAtlantic and Gulf coasts nearly to the Mississippi. On account of its\r\nfine grain it is much used in cabinet work and as a finishing wood. _Red\r\ncedar_, probably a different species, occurs along the Atlantic coast.\r\nIt is largely used in the manufacture of lead-pencils, and the forests\r\nare wellnigh exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe _redwoods_ are confined to the California coast, mainly in the coast\r\nranges, near the ocean. Ordinary redwood (_Sequoia sempervirens_)\r\nresembles red cedar, is soft, and very fine in grain, and shrinks but\r\nlittle in seasoning. It is a most valuable timber both for common and\r\nfor ornamental use. It very frequently attains a diameter of five or six\r\nfeet; the big tree sometimes exceeds sixteen feet in diameter and\r\nreaches a height of nearly four hundred feet.\r\n\r\n=Other Industrial Woods.=--The oaks, like the pines, form a nearly\r\ncontinuous belt across the northern continents, lying mainly south of\r\nthe pines; they do not extend much south of the thirtieth parallel. The\r\nwhite oak of the New England plateau and Canada commands a high price on\r\naccount of its strength; a considerable quantity is exported.\r\n\r\nThe "quartering" of the lumber used in ornamental work is produced by\r\nsawing the logs, which have been split in quarters, so that the\r\nsilver-grain shows on the faces of the boards. The bark of the oak is\r\nrich in tannic acid and it is much used in tanning leather. _Cork oak_\r\n(_Quercus suber_) grows mainly in Spain and Algeria.\r\n\r\n_Black walnut_ (_Juglans nigra_) grows in the river-bottoms of the\r\nMississippi Valley and in Texas. The merchantable supply is not great,\r\nand the wood is therefore growing more valuable each year. _Hickory_ is\r\nused where great strength is required, and also for various\r\ntool-handles. _Maple_ is largely employed in making furniture. _Ash_ is\r\na very common wood for tool-handles.\r\n\r\n=Shade-Trees and Ornamental Woods.=--A large number of trees are yearly\r\ntransplanted, or else grown from seed, to be used as ornamental\r\nshade-trees. For this purpose the elm, maple, acacia ("locust"), linden\r\n("lime"), catalpa, ash, horse-chestnut ("buckeye"), poplar, and willow\r\nare most common in ordinary temperate latitudes, both in Europe and\r\nAmerica. In warmer latitudes the Australian eucalyptus ("red gum" and\r\n"blue gum"), magnolia, palmetto, laurel, arbutus, and tulip are common.\r\nThe local trade in ornamental trees is very heavy; the trade is local\r\nfor the reason that the transportation of them is very expensive.\r\n\r\n=Tropical Woods and Tree Products.=--Many of the tropical woods are in\r\ndemand on account of their beautiful appearance, and in many species\r\nthis quality is combined with strength and hardness. _Mahogany_ is\r\nobtained from Mexico and the Central American states, and also from the\r\nWest Indies. The former is classed as "Honduras"; the latter is\r\ngenerally known as San Domingo mahogany and commands the highest price.\r\n_Rosewood_ is obtained from Brazil, and is used almost exclusively in\r\npiano-cases. Both are cut into thin veneers, to be glued to a less\r\nexpensive body.\r\n\r\n_Ebony_ is the heart of a species of persimmon obtained mainly in Ceylon\r\nand the East Indies. Very little of the so-called ebony is genuine, most\r\nof the ebony of commerce consisting of fine-grained hardwood, stained\r\nblack. _Jarrah_, an Australian wood, is now very generally used for\r\nstreet-paving, and for this purpose it has no superior. _Teak_ probably\r\nhas no equal for strength and durability. It is not touched by the\r\nteredo and other marine worms.\r\n\r\n_Boxwood_ (_Buxus balearica_) is a high-growing tree, native to India,\r\nbut growing best in the islands of the Mediterranean. The wood is very\r\nhard, of yellowish-brown color, and so fine in grain that it finds a\r\nready market in nearly every part of the world. Probably the larger part\r\nis used by engravers. A large amount of the wood is also used in the\r\nmanufacture of folding-rules, and in inlaying. Constantinople is the\r\nprincipal market, and nearly ten thousand tons of the selected wood are\r\nsold yearly.\r\n\r\n_Lignum vit\xc3\xa6_, or _guaiac wood_ (_Guaiacum officinale_), grows profusely\r\nin the West Indies and along the Spanish Main. It is used both in\r\nmedicine and in the arts. Shavings of the wood steeped in water were\r\nonce considered a cure-all, hence the name. The wood is very hard,\r\nheavy, and is split with the greatest difficulty. It is therefore much\r\nemployed in making mallet-heads, tool-handles, nine-pin balls, and\r\npulley-blocks. In tropical countries it is employed for railway ties.\r\nWest India ports are the chief markets, and the United States is the\r\nchief consumer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LOG RAFT, WINONA, WIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAULING LOGS TO THE RIVER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright, 1898, Detroit Photographic Co._\r\n\r\nTHE LUMBER INDUSTRY--A LOGGING STREAM, MENOMINEE, WIS.]\r\n\r\n_Logwood_ is the wood of a tree (_H\xc3\xa6matoxylon campechianum_) growing in\r\nCentral America and the West Indies. The best quality comes from\r\nCampeche, and it is marketed mainly from Central American ports. It is\r\nalmost universally used for dyeing the black of woollen and cotton\r\ntextiles, and logwood blacks are the standard of color-prints.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nIn what structures has timber been supplanted by iron and steel?\r\n\r\nIn what manufactured article has timber supplanted the use of rags?\r\n\r\nWhen a pine forest is cut away, what kinds of timber are apt to come up\r\nin place of the pines?\r\n\r\nIn what manner does the railway draw upon the forests?--the\r\npaper-maker?--the farmer?--the tanner?--the beaver?--the teredo, or\r\nship-worm?\r\n\r\nFrom what country or countries do the following come: boxwood, rosewood,\r\nsandal-wood, cinchona, bog oak, jarrah?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR STUDY AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nMake a list of the forestry growing in the State in which you live; so\r\nfar as possible, obtain a specimen of each wood, prepared so as to show\r\nsquare, oblique, split, and polished sections; for what purpose, if any,\r\nis each used?\r\n\r\nConsult "Check-list of Forestry of the United States" (U.S. Department\r\nof Agriculture).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSEA PRODUCTS AND FURS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world\'s fish-catch amounts probably to more than one-quarter of a\r\nbillion dollars in value and employs upward of a million people; in the\r\nUnited States 200,000 are employed. In some localities, such as the\r\noceanic islands, far distant from the grazing lands of the continents,\r\nthe flesh of fish is about the only fresh meat obtainable. Even on the\r\ncontinents fish is more available and cheaper than beef. The\r\nfish-producing areas pay no taxes; they require no cultivation;\r\nmoreover, they do not require to be purchased. In general, fish\r\nsupplements beef as an article of food; it is not a substitute for the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe whale-catch excepted, fish are generally caught in the shallow\r\nwaters of the continental coasts. The fish, in great schools, resort to\r\nsuch localities at certain seasons, and the seasons in which they school\r\nis the fisherman\'s opportunity. For the greater part, such shallows and\r\nbanks are spawning-places. Most of the fish, however, are caught off the\r\nAtlantic coasts of Europe and North America, these localities being\r\nnearest to the great centres of population.\r\n\r\n=Whales.=--The whale is sought mainly in cold waters, and at the present\r\ntime the chief whaling-grounds are in the vicinity of Point Barrow. In\r\nthe first half of the nineteenth century whale-fishing was an industry\r\ninvolving hundreds of vessels and a large aggregate capital. The\r\nindustry centred about New England seaports.\r\n\r\nThe train-oil obtained from the blubber of the animal was used partly\r\nas a lubricant, but mainly for illuminating purposes. For this purpose,\r\nhowever, it has been superseded by coal-oil, gas, and electricity. It is\r\nstill in demand as a lubricant, but the whale-oil of commerce is quite\r\nas apt to come from the blubber of the porpoise or the sea-cow as from\r\nthe right whale. Whalebone is a horny substance taken from the animal\'s\r\njaw, and is worth from three dollars to eight dollars per pound. It is\r\nused chiefly in the manufacture of whips. For other purposes, steel,\r\nhard rubber, and celluloid have taken its place.\r\n\r\nThe substance called _spermaceti_ is derived from the sperm-whale, an\r\ninhabitant of warm ocean-waters. Spermaceti is identical in its physical\r\nproperties with paraffine, and the latter is now almost universally its\r\nsubstitute.\r\n\r\n_Ambergris_, thought to be a morbid secretion or disease of the\r\nsperm-whale, is found in the body cavity of the animal and also in\r\nmasses floating in the sea. It is used chiefly to give intensity to the\r\nodor of perfumes, and the best quality brings as much as five dollars\r\nper ounce. Most of the ambergris of commerce is obtained from the\r\nneighborhood of the Bahama Islands.\r\n\r\n=Cod.=--In the amount of the product the cod-fisheries are the most\r\nimportant. The meat of the fish is not strong in flavor, and it is cured\r\nwith little expense. So valuable is the annual catch that the banks and\r\nshallows which the schools frequent are governed by international\r\ntreaties.\r\n\r\nThe cod is a cold-water fish, and the fishing-grounds are confined to\r\nrather high latitudes. The coast-waters of the Scandinavian peninsula\r\nand the shores of the Canadian coast, especially the Banks of\r\nNewfoundland, are the chief areas. The fishing-grounds of the Canadian\r\ncoast are closed to foreign vessels inside a three-mile limit; beyond\r\nthe limit they are occupied mainly by Canadian, French, and American\r\nfishermen. By the terms of treaties foreign vessels may enter the\r\nthree-mile limit under restriction to purchase bait and food-supplies,\r\nand to cure their fish.\r\n\r\nA large part of the cod-catch is exported. Tropical countries buy much\r\nof the product. In such countries it is more wholesome than meat; it is\r\ncheaper; moreover, the salted cod will keep for an indefinite length of\r\ntime. A large part of the catch is sold to the Catholic states of Europe\r\nand America, where during certain times the eating of the flesh of\r\nanimals is forbidden. Gloucester, Mass., London, England, and Trondhjem,\r\nNorway, are great markets for salted fish. The oil from the liver of the\r\ncod is much used in medicine.\r\n\r\n=Herring, Alewives, and Sardine.=--The herring is a much smaller fish than\r\nthe cod, and, commercially, is much less important. They school in about\r\nthe same waters as the cod, but are caught at a different season,\r\ngill-nets being usually employed. Practically no distinction is made\r\nbetween full-grown herring and alewives of the same size. The fish are\r\nusually cured by smoking, pickling, or salting, and in this form are\r\neither exported or sold in interior markets.\r\n\r\nThe true sardine is found in latitudes a little farther south than the\r\nschooling-grounds of the cod. The most important fisheries are along the\r\ncoasts of the Latin states of Europe. Sardine fishing is a great\r\nindustry all along the New England coast of the United States, but the\r\n"sardines" marketed from this region are young herring. Indeed, nearly\r\nall sorts of small fry are sold in boxes bearing spurious French labels.\r\n\r\n=Salmon.=--Most of the salmon are caught in the rivers flowing into the\r\nNorth Pacific Ocean. The fish are caught in traps and weirs at the time\r\nof the spring run, when they ascend the river to spawn. The rivers are\r\nfrequently so congested with the salmon that thousands of tons are\r\ncaught in a single stream during the run.\r\n\r\nThe salmon canneries of the Columbia River are very extensive\r\nestablishments, but in the past few years they have been surpassed by\r\nthe Alaskan fisheries, which produce not far from fifty million pounds\r\neach year. The dressed fish is cooked by steam, canned, and exported to\r\nall parts of the world. The growth and development of the industry has\r\nalso made an enormous demand on the tin mines of the world. Canned\r\nsalmon is the largest fish export of the United States. There are\r\nextensive salmon-fisheries in Norway, Japan, and Russia.\r\n\r\n=Other Fish.=--_Mackerel_ and _haddock_ are caught near the shores of the\r\nNorth Atlantic. Most of the mackerel-catch is pickled in brine and sold\r\nin small kegs known as "kits." The _menhaden_-catch of the North\r\nAtlantic is converted into fertilizer. The _halibut_ is a large fish\r\nthat is rarely preserved. The area in which it is caught is about the\r\nsame as that of the cod. _Shad_ are usually caught when ascending the\r\nrivers of the middle Atlantic coast. In the United States, Chesapeake,\r\nDelaware, and New York Bays yield the chief supply. The _bluefish_ and\r\n_barracuda_ are warm-water fish. The market for fresh fish has been\r\ngreatly enlarged by the use of refrigerator-cars.\r\n\r\nThe _sturgeon_ is captured mainly in the rivers and lakes of the\r\ntemperate zone. Those of the Black Sea sometimes attain a weight of\r\n2,000 pounds. The flesh is of less importance than the eggs, of which\r\ncaviare is made. Russian caviare is sold all over Europe and America,\r\nand not a small part of the product is made in Maine. The caviare made\r\nfrom the roe of the Delaware River sturgeon is exported to Germany. The\r\n_tunny_ is confined to Mediterranean waters.\r\n\r\nThe _anchovy_ is caught on the coast of Europe; most of the product is\r\npreserved, or made into the well-known "anchovy sauce." The\r\n_beche-de-mere_, or "sea cucumber," is a product of Australasian and\r\nMalaysian waters. Almost the whole catch is purchased by the Chinese,\r\nand it is exported to all countries having a Chinese population.\r\n\r\n=Oysters and Lobsters.=--The oyster is among the foremost sea products of\r\nthe United States in value. The oyster thrives best in moderately warm\r\nand sheltered waters. The coves and estuaries along the middle Atlantic\r\ncoast produce the best in the world. Chesapeake Bay and Long Island\r\nSound yield the greater part of the output. In the latter waters\r\nelaborate methods of propagation are carried out, and the yearly crop is\r\nincreasing both in quality and quantity. The output of the Chesapeake\r\nbeds has decreased materially; that of the Long Island Sound beds has\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nOysters are plentiful along the Pacific coast of the United States and\r\nalso in European coast-waters, but they are inferior in size and\r\nquality. The use of refrigerator-cars and vessels has extended the trade\r\nto the extent that fresh oysters are shipped to points 2,000 miles\r\ninland; they are also exported to Europe. Baltimore is the chief\r\noyster-market.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of the lobster has been so great that the catch of the\r\nNew England coast has decreased about one-half in the past fifty years,\r\nand the United States is now an importer. Most of the import, amounting\r\nto about one million dollars yearly, comes from Canada. The so-called\r\nlobsters of the Pacific coast of the United States are not lobsters, but\r\ncrayfish.\r\n\r\n=Fish Hatcheries.=--The demand for fish has grown so great in past years\r\nthat in many countries the waters, especially the lakes and rivers, are\r\nrestocked. The eggs are hatched and the young fry are fed until they\r\nare large enough to take care of themselves. The chief hatchery and\r\nlaboratory of the United States Fish Commission is at Woods Holl, Mass.\r\nAs many as 860,000,000 eggs, small fry, and adult fish have been\r\ndistributed in a single year. The State of New York has also a similar\r\ndepartment for restocking its waters.\r\n\r\n=Sponge.=--This substance is practically the skeleton of a low order of\r\nanimal, growing at the bottom of the sea. The sponge is cut from the\r\nplace of attachment, and the gelatinous matter is washed away after\r\nputrefaction. The chief sponge-fisheries are in the neighborhood of\r\nFlorida and the Bahama Islands.\r\n\r\n=Seal.=--The fur-seal is an amphibian, found only in cold waters. A few\r\npelts are obtained along the Greenland coast, but the chief\r\nsealing-grounds of the world have been at the Pribilof Islands, in\r\nBering Sea. The pelts of the young males only are taken. The rookeries\r\nof the Pribilof Islands have been so nearly exhausted, that the killing\r\nseason has been suspended for a term of years. Much illicit\r\nseal-catching is still going on, however.\r\n\r\nThe skins are taken to London, via San Francisco, where the fur is dyed\r\na rich brown color; London is the chief market for dyed pelts; San\r\nFrancisco for raw pelts; and New York, Paris, and St. Petersburg for\r\ngarments. The pelts of the sea-otter are obtained mainly in the North\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n=Other Furs.=--The furs employed in the finest garments are in part the\r\npelts of land animals living in polar regions. The sable, stone-marten,\r\notter, beaver, and red fox are the most valuable. The Persian lamb,\r\nhowever, is not a polar animal. The Russian Empire and Canada are the\r\nchief sources of supply. The Hudson Bay Company, with head-quarters at\r\nFort Garry, near Winnipeg, controls most of the fur-trade of North\r\nAmerica; the Russian furs are marketed mainly at Lower Novgorod.\r\nLeipzig, Germany, is also an important fur-market.\r\n\r\nEnormous quantities of rabbit-skins from Australia and nutria from\r\nArgentina are imported into the United States and Europe for the\r\nmanufacture of the felt of which hats are made. The amount of this\r\nsubstance may be realized when one considers that not far from two\r\nhundred million people in the two countries wear felt hats.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nNote an instance in which the search for deep-sea fishing-grounds has\r\nresulted in the discovery of unknown lands.\r\n\r\nWhy are not whale products as essential now as a century ago?\r\n\r\nWhat international complications have arisen between the United States\r\nand Great Britain concerning the cod-fisheries?--the seal-catch?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTH AMERICA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES--THE SEAPORTS AND THE ATLANTIC COAST-PLAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States of America together with the possessions included\r\nwithin the domain of the Republic comprise an area somewhat greater than\r\nthat of Europe.\r\n\r\nWith respect to latitude, the position of the main body of the United\r\nStates is extremely fortunate. Practically all its area is situated in\r\nthe warmer half of the temperate zone. Only a small part lies beyond the\r\nnorthern limit of the corn belt; wheat, oats, and barley are cultivated\r\nsuccessfully throughout four-fifths of its extent in latitude; grass,\r\nand therefore cattle and sheep are grown in nearly every part. Coal,\r\niron, copper, gold, and silver, the minerals and metals which give to a\r\nnation its greatest material power, exist in abundance, and the\r\nsuccessful working of these deposits have placed the country upon a very\r\nhigh commercial plane.\r\n\r\nTopographically the United States may be divided into the following\r\nregions:\r\n\r\n     The Atlantic Coast-Plain,\r\n     The Appalachian Ranges and the New England Plateau,\r\n     The Basin of the Great Lakes,\r\n     The Northern Mississippi Valley Region,\r\n     The Southern Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast,\r\n     The Arid Plains,\r\n     The Plateau Region,\r\n     The Pacific Coast Lowlands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HARBOR--NEW YORK BAY, AT THE BATTERY]\r\n\r\nThe topographic and climatic features of these various regions have had\r\na great influence not only on the political history of the country, but\r\ntheir effect has been even greater in determining its industrial\r\ndevelopment. They have resulted in the establishment of the various\r\nindustries, each in the locality best adapted to it, instead of their\r\ndiffusion without respect to the necessary conditions of environment.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing regions are also approximately areas of fundamental\r\nindustries. Thus, the New England plateau supplies the rest of the\r\nUnited States with light manufactures, such as cotton textiles, woollen\r\nclothing, hats, shoes, cutlery, books, writing-paper, household metal\r\nwares, etc., but sells the excess abroad. The middle and southern\r\nAppalachians, with the coal which forms their chief resource, supply the\r\nrest of the country with structural steel, from ores obtained in the\r\nlake regions, and sell the excess to foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe northern Mississippi Valley grows nearly one-fourth of the world\'s\r\nwheat-crop. The wheat of this region and the Pacific coast lowlands\r\nsupplies the country with bread-stuffs, and exports the excess to\r\nwestern Europe. The Gulf states, which produce three-fourths of the\r\nworld\'s cotton-crop, supply the whole country and about one-half the\r\nrest of the world besides with cotton textiles. The grazing regions\r\nproduce an excess of meat for export; the western highlands furnish the\r\ngold and silver necessary to carry on the enormous commerce.\r\n\r\nIn the last twenty years the imports of merchandise per capita varied\r\nbut little from $11.50; the exports per capita varied from about $12 to\r\nmore than $18.\r\n\r\n=The Atlantic Coast-Plain and the Seaports.=--Throughout most of its\r\nextent the Atlantic seaboard of the United States is bordered by a low\r\ncoast-plain. Along the northeastern coast of the United States the\r\ncoast-plain is very narrow; south of New York Bay it has a width in\r\nsome places of more than two hundred miles.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this plain has had a marked effect on the commercial\r\ndevelopment of the country. The sinking or "drowning" of the northern\r\npart of it has made an exceedingly indented coast. The drowned valleys,\r\nenclosed by ridges and headlands, form the best of harbors, and nearly\r\nall of them are northeast of New York Bay. South of New York Bay good\r\nharbors are comparatively few. For the greater part they occur only when\r\nold, buried river-channels permit approach to the shore.\r\n\r\nThe most important port of entry in these harbors is _New York_, and it\r\nderives its importance from two factors. It has a very capacious harbor,\r\ninto which vessels drawing as much as thirty-five feet may enter; its\r\nsituation at the lower end of a series of valleys and passes makes it\r\nalmost a dead level route from the Mississippi to the Atlantic seaboard.\r\nThe importance of New York as the commercial gateway between European\r\nports and the food-producing region of the American continent began when\r\nthe Erie Canal was opened between the Great Lakes and tide-water. The\r\ncompletion of the canal for the first time opened the rich farming lands\r\nof the interior to European markets. Probably a greater tonnage of\r\nfreight is carried yearly over this route than over any other channel of\r\ntrade in the world.\r\n\r\nNot far from two-thirds of the foreign commerce of the country passes\r\nthrough the port of New York. The water-front of the city has an\r\naggregate length of about three hundred miles, of which one-third is\r\navailable for anchorage. The docks and piers, including those of Jersey\r\nCity and Hoboken, aggregate about ninety miles in frontage.\r\n\r\nAbout sixteen thousand sea-going craft enter and clear yearly, and an\r\naverage of nearly twenty large passenger and freight steamships arrive\r\nand clear daily, about one-half of them being foreign. The latter\r\nreceive their cargoes from about three thousand freight-cars that are\r\ndaily switched into the various freight-yards, a large part of which is\r\nthrough freight from the west.\r\n\r\nThe port of entry of _New York_ is a centre of population of about four\r\nmillion, and although there are the industries usually found in great\r\ncommunities, the greater business enterprises practically reduce\r\nthemselves to export, import, and exchange. For this reason New York\r\nCity is the financial, as well as the commercial centre of the\r\ncontinent. Most of the great industrial corporations of the country have\r\ntheir head offices in the city. These are financed by more than one\r\nhundred banks, together with a clearing-house whose yearly business\r\namounted in 1902 to considerably more than seventy billions of\r\ndollars.[50]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOSTON HARBOR]\r\n\r\n_Boston_ has been one of the leading ports of the United States for\r\nconsiderably more than a century. It ranks second among the ports of the\r\nUnited States. Regular lines of transit connect it with the principal\r\nports of Great Britain and Canada. The coast trade is also very heavy.\r\nBoston is the financial and commercial centre of New England; the\r\ncotton, woollen, and leather goods passing through the port find their\r\nway to nearly every inhabited part of the world. The city controls a\r\nconsiderable export trade of food-stuffs from the upper Mississippi\r\nValley. The vessels entering and clearing at Boston indicate a movement\r\nof about four million five hundred thousand tons, about one-fourth that\r\nof New York. The clearing-house exchanges average about six billion\r\ndollars yearly.\r\n\r\n_Philadelphia_, on account of its distance inland, is not fortunately\r\nsituated for ocean commerce. Steamships of deep draught reach their\r\ndocks at the lower end of the city under their own steam, but\r\nsailing-craft pay heavy towage fees. There are regular lines to\r\nLiverpool, Antwerp, West Indian ports, Baltimore, and Boston.\r\nPhiladelphia is the centre of the anthracite coal trade, and this is the\r\nchief factor of its domestic trade. The imports of fruit from the West\r\nIndies, carpet-wool from Europe, and raw sugar from the West Indies,\r\nform the greater part of its foreign business. The manufactures are\r\nmainly carpets and rugs, locomotives and iron steamships, and refined\r\nsugar. The carpet-weaving and the ship-building plants are among the\r\nlargest in the world. The ocean movement of freight is more than three\r\nmillion five hundred thousand tons yearly. The business of the\r\nclearing-house in 1902 aggregated nearly six billion dollars.\r\n\r\n_Baltimore_ is likewise handicapped by its distance inland.\r\nSailing-vessels, however, require only a short towage, the docks being\r\nscarcely a dozen miles from Chesapeake Bay. The harbor is deep and\r\ncapacious. The Pennsylvania and Baltimore & Ohio railway systems have\r\nmade Baltimore an important railway centre. The completion of the Gould\r\nrailway system to the Atlantic seaboard has made the city second to New\r\nYork only in the export of corn, wheat, flour, and tobacco. The most\r\nnoteworthy local industry is the oyster product, which is the greatest\r\nin the world. Nearly ten thousand people are employed, and during the\r\nbusy season--from September to the end of April--about thirty carloads\r\nof oysters a day are shipped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLESTON HARBOR]\r\n\r\nThe yearly movement of marine freight, entering and clearing, aggregates\r\nabout three million tons. In 1902 the clearing-house exchanges\r\naggregated about two and one-quarter billion dollars.\r\n\r\n_Portland_, Me., has good harbor facilities, but is distant from the\r\ngreat lines of traffic. Steamship lines, which in summer make Montreal a\r\nterminal point, occasionally make Portland their winter harbor. _Newport\r\nNews_, _Savannah_, _Charleston_, and _Brunswick_ are growing in\r\nimportance as clearing ports for the cotton and produce from the region\r\nwest of them. _Norfolk_ obtains importance on account of the United\r\nStates Navy-Yard; it is also the great peanut-market of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat are the requisites of a good seaport?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by the draught of a vessel?\r\n\r\nFor what purposes are pilots?\r\n\r\nHow are navigable channels marked and designated?\r\n\r\nFrom the Statistical Abstract find six or more of the leading exports\r\nfrom each of the following ports: New York, Boston, Baltimore,\r\nPhiladelphia, and the port nearest which you live.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL REFERENCE\r\n\r\nStatistical Abstract of the United States.\r\n\r\nStatesman\'s Year-Book.\r\n\r\nIndustrial Evolution of the United States--Chapter II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES--THE NEW ENGLAND PLATEAU AND THE APPALACHIAN REGION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing regions of the United States, which connect the\r\ncountry with the rest of the world, include mainly the New England\r\nplateau and the Appalachian ranges.\r\n\r\n=The New England Plateau.=--This region embraces the New England States\r\nand practically includes all the eastern part of New York and northern\r\nNew Jersey. The abruptly sloping surface affords a great wealth of\r\nwater-power, and the region is one of the most important centres of\r\nlight manufacture in the world. This industry resulted very largely from\r\nthe conditions imposed by the War of 1812 and its consequent\r\nnon-intercourse acts.\r\n\r\nThe interruption of foreign commerce not only cut off the importation of\r\nmanufactured commodities, but also made idle the capital employed.\r\nManufacturing enterprises started in various parts of the United States,\r\nbut they prospered in this region for three reasons--an abundance of\r\npower, plenty of capital, and business experience. Steam-power is\r\nlargely supplanting water-power in the manufacturing enterprises, and in\r\nmany instances the establishments have been moved to tide-water in order\r\nto get their coal at the lowest rates of transportation.\r\n\r\nChief among the manufactures are cotton textiles, the yearly output of\r\nwhich is about three hundred million dollars. About nine-tenths of the\r\ncotton goods made are consumed at home. Of the remainder, China\r\npurchases one-half. Great Britain and Canada take one-fourth, the South\r\nAmerican and Central American states purchase most of the remaining\r\noutput. The great improvement of spinning and weaving machinery has\r\nenabled the cotton manufacturer to export his wares to about every\r\ncountry in the world.\r\n\r\nBoots, shoes, and other leather goods are also important manufactures.\r\nThe invention of improved machinery for making shoes has revolutionized\r\nthe industry to the extent that a pair of stylish shoes may be purchased\r\nanywhere in the United States for about half the price charged in 1880.\r\nAnother result is the enormous importation of hides from South American\r\ncountries and Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe New England plateau is also the centre of a large number of\r\nmanufactures that require a high degree of mechanical skill and\r\nintellectual training, such as small fire-arms, machinery, watches and\r\nclocks, jewelry, machine-tools, etc. The location of such industries\r\ndepends but little upon climate, topography, or the cost of\r\ntransportation; it is wholly a question of an educated and trained\r\npeople. This region is likely to lose a considerable part of its\r\nmanufactures of cotton textiles, inasmuch as the industry is gradually\r\nmoving to the cotton-growing region. The manufactures requiring training\r\nand skill, however, are likely to remain in the region where they have\r\ngrown up.\r\n\r\n_Lawrence_, _Lowell_, _Manchester_, and _Nashua_--all on the Merrimac\r\nRiver; _Lewiston_, _Waterville_, _Augusta_, _Woonsocket_, and\r\n_Adams_--each situated at falls or rapids--are great centres of cotton\r\nmanufacture. Fall River has an abundance of water-power, and at the same\r\ntime is situated on tide-water. Having the advantage of good power and\r\ncheap transportation, it has probably the greatest output of cotton\r\ntextiles of any city in the world. Textile establishments have also\r\ngrown up in the cities and towns of the Mohawk Valley, being attracted\r\nby the excellent facilities for transportation and also by the available\r\nwater-power. _Lynn_, _Brockton_, _Haverhill_, _Marlboro_, and\r\n_Worcester_ are centres of boot and shoe manufacture; they turn out\r\nabout two-thirds of the product of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Bridgeport_ and _New Haven_ have very large plants for the manufacture\r\nof fire-arms and fixed ammunition; _Waterbury_ and _Ansonia_ for\r\nwatches, clocks, and brass goods; _Meriden_ for silverware, and\r\n_Waltham_ for watches. _Worcester_, _Hartford_, _North Adams_,\r\n_Fitchburg_, and _Providence_ have each a great variety of manufactures.\r\nThe foreign commerce of these manufacturing centres is carried on mainly\r\nthrough _Boston_. _New Haven_, _New Bedford_, _Providence_, _Salem_,\r\n_Gloucester_, and _New London_ control each a very large local commerce.\r\n\r\nSouth of New York Bay the Atlantic coast-plain attains an average width\r\nof nearly two hundred miles. The pine forests of this plain yield\r\nlumber, tar, pitch, and turpentine. The productive lands are valuable\r\nchiefly for their output of dairy stuffs, fruit, and "garden truck,"\r\nwhich find a ready market in the larger cities. In order to encourage\r\nthis industry, the railways make special rates for dairy products,\r\nfruit, and vegetables, and afford quick transit for such freight.\r\n\r\nManufacturing industries are rapidly taking shape in this part of the\r\nUnited States. Along the line where the coast-plain proper joins the\r\nfoot-hills of the Appalachian ranges, the rivers reach the lower levels\r\nby rapids or falls. The estuaries into which they flow are usually\r\nnavigable for river-craft. The manufacturer thus has the double\r\nadvantage of water-power and low transportation. The opening of the\r\nsouthern Appalachian coal-mines has also greatly encouraged manufacture\r\nin this region. _Richmond_, _Columbia_, _Milledgeville_, _Augusta_, and\r\n_Columbus_ are thus situated. Their manufactures are very largely\r\nconnected with the cotton-crop.\r\n\r\nThe domestic commerce of the Atlantic seaboard of the United States is\r\nprobably larger than that of any other similar region in the world. It\r\nis considerably larger than the "round-the-island" trade of Great\r\nBritain. Much of this trade is carried by steam-vessels, but the\r\nthree-masted schooner is everywhere in evidence, and these craft carry a\r\nvery large part of the coal that is moved by water. This trade is\r\nrestricted to vessels flying the American flag.\r\n\r\n=The Appalachian Region.=--The middle and southern Appalachian region has\r\nbecome the most important centre of iron and steel manufacture in the\r\nworld. This great development has resulted from several causes, the\r\nchief being the existence of coal and unlimited quantities of iron ore\r\non the one hand, and unusual facilities for cheap transportation on the\r\nother. There are practically three areas of steel manufacture--one along\r\nthe Ohio River and its tributaries in western Pennsylvania; another is\r\nsituated along the south shores of Lake Erie and Lake Michigan; the\r\nthird includes the Birmingham district in the southern Appalachians.\r\n\r\nThe steel-making plants of the Ohio River are located with reference to\r\nthe transportation of their products, and therefore are built usually\r\nalongside the river. The coal or coke is commonly shipped in barges of\r\nlight draught; the manufactured products are carried by rail. The\r\ngreater part of the ore is brought from the Lake Superior region. It is\r\nshipped at a very small cost from the ore quarries to the lake-shore,\r\nand by rail from the lake-shore to the manufacturing plant. In order to\r\navoid heavy grades the ore railways are also built along the\r\nriver-valleys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEEL MANUFACTURE--ERECTING SHOP OF THE BALDWIN\r\nLOCOMOTIVE WORKS, PHILADELPHIA]\r\n\r\nSome of the various steel-making plants are equipped for the\r\nmanufacture of building or "structural" steel, others for rails and\r\nrailway equipments, still others for tin-plate, or for wire, or for tool\r\nsteel. In a few mills armor-plate and ordinary plate for steel vessels\r\nform the exclusive product. The diversity of the product has led to the\r\norganization of great corporations, each of which controls half-a-dozen\r\nor more plants, the transportation lines necessary to carry the product,\r\nthe ore quarries, and the fuel-mines.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful development of the steel industry in the United States is\r\ndue to the use of labor-saving machinery, and to the superb\r\norganization. The wages paid for labor are higher than those paid in\r\nEuropean steel-making centres; the cost of living is not materially\r\ngreater. The price of steel rails, which in 1880 was forty-eight dollars\r\nper ton, in 1900 was about twenty dollars per ton.\r\n\r\n_Pittsburg_, together with _Homestead_, _Carnegie_, _McKeesport_,\r\n_Duquesne_, and _Braddock_, is the chief steel-making centre of the Ohio\r\nRiver Valley. There are also large plants at _New Castle_, _Sharon_,\r\n_Scranton_, _Johnstown_, _Bellaire_, _Youngstown_, _Mingo Junction_, and\r\n_Wheeling_. The steel-plant and rolling-mills at _South Bethlehem_ are\r\ndesigned especially for the manufacture of the heavy ordnance used in\r\nthe army and navy. Nearly all the cities and towns of Pennsylvania, West\r\nVirginia, and eastern Ohio carry on manufacturing enterprises that\r\ndepend on coal mining and steel manufacture. The great and diversified\r\nmanufactures of Philadelphia are due to its fortunate situation at\r\ntide-water, near the coal-mines. Cheap fuel and water transportation\r\nhave made it one of the great industrial centres of the world.\r\n\r\nThe anthracite coal of this region is used wholly for fuel and\r\nsteam-making; it is shipped partly by water from Philadelphia, but\r\nmainly in specially constructed cars to the various points of\r\nconsumption. The soft coal is used also for fuel and steam-making, but a\r\nlarge part of the product is converted into coke and used in the\r\nsteel-plants.\r\n\r\nThe petroleum of this region is a leading export of the country, the\r\nstates of western Europe being the chief purchasers. Of agricultural\r\nproducts, hay, dairy products, and tobacco are the only ones of\r\nimportance. Natural gas is used both as a fuel and in manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe lake-shore centre of steel manufacture depends largely on the low\r\ncost of transporting the iron ore, which in part is offset by the\r\nincreased cost of coal. The low cost of shipping the manufactured\r\nproduct over nearly level trunk lines is a very substantial gain. _South\r\nChicago_, _Toledo_, _Sandusky_, _Lorain_, _Cleveland_, _Ashtabula_,\r\n_Conneaut_, _Erie_, and _Buffalo_ are centres of steel manufacture or\r\nore shipment, because they are situated on this great trade-route or\r\nline of least resistance.\r\n\r\nThe coal-mines and iron-making plants of the southern Appalachians have\r\na considerable area. The chief manufacturing centres are _Birmingham_,\r\n_Richmond_, _Roanoke_, and _Chattanooga_. A considerable part of the\r\nVirginia ores find their way to the Ohio River steel-mills. Open-hearth\r\nsteel is an important manufacture in Birmingham. A large part of the\r\nores smelted in the southern Appalachian region are made into foundry\r\niron.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages and the disadvantages of manufacturing cotton\r\ntextiles in the New England States?\r\n\r\nWhy have the mining of ore and the manufacture of steel become generally\r\nunprofitable in the New England States?\r\n\r\nWhat causes have brought about the lowering of the prices of cotton\r\ntextiles during the past fifty years?--of shoes?\r\n\r\nWhat makes the manufacture of artificial ice a precarious business north\r\nof the latitude of Philadelphia?\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages and the disadvantages arising from the location\r\nof a manufacturing industry at a seaport?\r\n\r\nWhat is the design of a protective tariff?

A certain amount of\r\nbread-stuffs, meat, and dairy products are grown in nearly every part of\r\nthe country for local use, but the grain, meat, and cotton of this\r\nregion are designed for export, and are therefore factors in the world\'s\r\ncommerce. The basin of the Great Lakes connects the Mississippi Valley\r\nwith the Atlantic seaboard.\r\n\r\n=The Basin of the Great Lakes.=--This region includes not only the Great\r\nLakes and the area drained by the streams flowing into them, but also a\r\nconsiderable region surrounding that commercially is tributary to the\r\ntraffic passing over the lakes. This basin itself is a part of a\r\ntrade-route destined very shortly to become one of the greatest highways\r\nof traffic in the world.\r\n\r\nThe lakes afford a navigable water-way which, measured due east and\r\nwest, aggregates nearly six hundred miles. This route is interrupted at\r\nNiagara Falls and at St. Mary\'s Falls, between Lake Superior and Lake\r\nHuron. On the Canadian side, Welland Canal, Lake Ontario, and the St.\r\nLawrence connect Lake Erie with tide-water. In the United States the\r\nErie Canal connects the lake with the Hudson River and New York Bay.\r\n\r\nFrom the head of Lake Superior railway routes of minimum grades--the\r\nGreat Northern and the Northern Pacific[51]--cross the continent to\r\nPuget Sound, the best harbor approach to the Pacific coast of the\r\nAmerican continent. The harbors of Puget Sound, moreover, are materially\r\nnearer the great Asian ports than any other port of the United States.\r\nThe level margins of these lakes are roadbeds for many miles of railway\r\ntrack; in many instances the railways are built on the tops of terraces\r\nthat once were shores of the lakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DULUTH]\r\n\r\n_Duluth_, at the head of Lake Superior, became commercially important\r\nwhen the St. Mary\'s Falls Canal was completed. Much of the tremendous\r\ntonnage of freight passing through the canal is assembled at this place.\r\nThe freight shipped consists mainly of farm products collected from an\r\narea reaching as far west as the Rocky Mountains. There is also a\r\nconsiderable shipment of iron ores obtained near by. _Buffalo_, at the\r\nlower end of Lake Erie, owes its activity to the trade in lumber, grain,\r\nand other farm products that come from Western lake-ports. It is the\r\neastern terminus of the lake-commerce and the western terminus of the\r\nErie Canal.\r\n\r\n_Chicago_, at the head of Lake Michigan, has a very heavy lake-trade.\r\nThe mouth of Chicago River, the natural harbor of the city, has been\r\nimproved by a system of basins and breakwaters. The river itself has\r\nbeen converted into a ship and drainage canal that is connected with the\r\nIllinois and Mississippi Rivers. It is now an outlet instead of a feeder\r\nto the lake, and the city built about old Fort Dearborn has become the\r\ngreatest railway centre in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF LOCKS AND CANAL, SAULT STE. MARIE]\r\n\r\n_Milwaukee_ has a situation in many ways resembling that of Chicago,\r\nits harbor being the mouth of Milwaukee River. Like Chicago, it owes its\r\nimportance to its lake-trade. _Detroit_ (with _Windsor_, Ont.) owes its\r\ngrowth partly to its strategic position on the strait connecting Lake\r\nHuron and Lake Erie, and partly for its position between the lakes. It\r\nis an important collecting and distributing point for lake-freights, and\r\nthe chief centre of commerce with Canada. Several east-and-west trunk\r\nlines and local lines of railway have freight terminals in the city; it\r\nis also the centre of the most complete system of interurban electric\r\nrailways in the world. _Port Huron_ (with _Sarnia_, Ont.) has a\r\ngeographic position similar to that of Detroit, and is also an important\r\nlake-port. The St. Clair River is tunnelled at this point. _Cleveland_,\r\n_Toledo_, _Sandusky_, and _Erie_ contribute very largely to the\r\nlake-trade. _Grand Rapids_ is the business centre of furniture\r\nmanufacture of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe great iron-ore ranges about Lake Superior have had much to do with\r\nthe growth of the local lake-trade. This has resulted in the\r\nestablishment of a large number of shipping-ports near the head of the\r\nlakes, and also a number of receiving ports on the south shores of Lake\r\nErie and Lake Michigan. Some of the latter have become also great\r\nmanufacturing centres of structural iron and steel.\r\n\r\nVarious centres of industry at a considerable distance from the Great\r\nLakes are contributors to their trade. Thus, on account of the low rate\r\nfor grain between _Chicago_ and _New York City_--about 5-1/4 cents per\r\nbushel--there are yearly very heavy shipments of the grain designed for\r\nLiverpool. _St. Paul_ and _Minneapolis_ are also collecting and\r\ndistributing centres of lake-freights. A considerable part of the\r\nbusiness of the lake-region is carried on by the Canadians, who have\r\nimproved their resources for production and transportation to the\r\nutmost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright, Detroit Photographic Co._\r\n\r\nAURORA IRON MINES, IRONWOOD, MICHIGAN]\r\n\r\n=The Northern Mississippi Valley Region.=--This region extends from the\r\nAppalachian ranges to the western limit of wheat and cotton growing. On\r\nthe south it is limited by the cotton-growing region. Its boundaries are\r\ntherefore climatic and commercial.\r\n\r\nThe surface is level; there is a rich, deep soil and an abundant\r\nrainfall. It has therefore become one of the foremost regions of the\r\nworld in the production of corn, wheat, pork, dairy-stuffs, and general\r\nfarm produce. The evolution of farming machinery is the direct result of\r\ntopographic conditions. A level, fertile region naturally invites\r\ngrain-farming on a large scale. This, in turn, must depend very largely\r\non the ability of the farmer to plant and harvest his crops with the\r\nminimum of expense and time.\r\n\r\nHand-work in harvesting and planting has almost wholly given way to\r\nmachine-work. Farming carried on under such conditions requires not only\r\na considerable capital, but close business management as well. Some of\r\nthe results have been very far-reaching. The machinery and other\r\nequipments require capital, and this in late years has been borrowed\r\nfrom Eastern capitalists. The prompt business methods of the\r\nmoney-lender brought about no little friction, and it is only within\r\nrecent years that each adjusted himself to the requirements of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe system of machine-farming to a great extent has prevented the\r\nsubdivision of farms. As a rule, quarter and half sections represent the\r\nsize of most of the farms, but tracts varying from five thousand to ten\r\nthousand acres are by no means uncommon. The chief drawback to this\r\nmethod in the case of wheat-farming, however, is the low yield per acre.\r\nThe average yield per acre for the United States, a little more than\r\ntwelve bushels, is scarcely half the average yield in Europe. Although\r\nthe farmer has done much to reorganize his business methods, he has done\r\nbut little to maintain the productivity of his land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WHEAT INDUSTRY--HARVESTING WITH McCORMICK\r\nSELF-BINDING REAPERS]\r\n\r\nThe cities and towns of this region are mainly receiving and collecting\r\npoints for farm produce. Nearly every village is equipped with elevators\r\nand grain-handling machinery; the larger towns, as a rule, have\r\nstock-yards and the necessary facilities for cattle shipment; the large\r\ncities are usually centres of meat-packing. Most of the meat-packing is\r\na necessity; for although cattle may be shipped alive and beef may be\r\ntransported in refrigerator ships and cars, pork is not marketable\r\nunless pickled, salted, or smoked. The pork thus exported, aggregating\r\nabout six hundred million pounds yearly, must be prepared, therefore,\r\nsomewhere near the cornfields. Manufacturing enterprises are operated on\r\na very large scale, but in the main their products are farm-machinery\r\nand the commodities required by a farming population.\r\n\r\nEducation in agriculture is provided for in nearly every State in the\r\nUnion. The agricultural colleges in the States composing this group rank\r\namong the best in the world. In addition to the ordinary courses in such\r\ninstitutions, there are also many experiment stations for the study of\r\neconomic plants, cattle diseases, and insect pests.\r\n\r\n_Chicago_ is the largest food-market in the world. The industries of the\r\ncity are almost wholly connected with the commerce of grain, pork, meat,\r\nand other food-stuffs. For the transportation of these commodities about\r\nthirty great trunk lines enter the city and about twelve hundred\r\npassenger trains daily arrive and depart from its stations.\r\n\r\nThe freight terminals are connected by transfer and belt lines, which\r\nreceive and distribute the cars passing between the eastern and the\r\nwestern roads. More than five hundred freight trains, aggregating about\r\ntwenty thousand cars, arrive and depart daily.\r\n\r\n_St. Louis_ originally derived its importance as a river-port of the\r\nMississippi, having been the connecting commercial link between the\r\nupper and the lower river. In recent years it has become the metropolis\r\nof the southern part of the food-producing region. In addition to the\r\nriver-trade, still largely controlled at this point, it is the focus of\r\nmore than twenty trunk lines of railway. Some of these, like the trunk\r\nlines of Chicago, handle freight exchanged between the East and West;\r\nbut a large proportion are receiving and distributing roads for Southern\r\nfreight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTOMOTIVE POWER IN THE INDUSTRIES OF THE MISSISSIPPI\r\nVALLEY]\r\n\r\n_St. Paul_ and _Minneapolis_ are the metropolis of the upper\r\nMississippi. The former grew from a trading-post at the head of\r\nnavigation; the latter gained its commercial prominence from the\r\nwater-power at the falls of St. Anthony. The former has become the chief\r\nrailway and distributing centre of the northern Mississippi Valley; the\r\nlatter has the greatest flour-mills in the world, and an extensive\r\nlumber-trade. Both are situated on the trade-route between the United\r\nStates and Asian ports, and distribute a part of the trade that comes\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nThe two _Kansas Cities_,[52] _Omaha_, _South Omaha_, and _Sioux City_\r\nare stock-markets and meat-packing centres. The first two named are\r\ncollecting and distributing points not only for the Mississippi Valley,\r\nbut also for a considerable share of the Pacific Coast trade. Kansas\r\nCity is also a transfer station for the cotton destined for China. From\r\nthis place it is sent by way of Billings to Seattle, and thence shipped\r\nto China.\r\n\r\n_Cincinnati_ is the metropolis of the Ohio Valley. Its situation on a\r\nbend of the river gives most excellent landing facilities; the easy\r\ngrade from the bluff to the bottom-lands along the flood-plain of Mill\r\nCreek makes it accessible to the railways that enter the city. On\r\naccount of low rates of transportation by river-barges, about three\r\nmillion tons of coal and one million tons of pig-iron and steel billets\r\nare floated to the city to be manufactured into other steel products.\r\n_Indianapolis_ is a great railway centre, where much of the freight\r\npassing between Chicago, Louisville, Cincinnati, and Pittsburg is\r\nexchanged. _Columbus_ (O.) is similarly situated as a railway and\r\nfarming centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATTLE AND DAIRY PRODUCTS]\r\n\r\n_Louisville_ is a market of the tobacco region, and has probably a\r\nlarger business in this industry than any other city in the world.\r\n_Davenport_, _Rock Island_, and _Moline_ form a single commercial\r\ncentre, the last-named having the largest establishment for the\r\nmanufacture of ploughs in the world. _Dubuque_, _Burlington_, _Quincy_,\r\nand _Muscatine_ are river-ports, all having a considerable trade in the\r\nlumber that is carried down the river.\r\n\r\n=The Southern Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast.=--This region receives a\r\ngenerous warmth and rainfall. Cotton is its staple product, and nearly\r\nall the industries are connected with the growth, shipment, and\r\nmanufacture of the crop and its side products. The cotton, raw or\r\nmanufactured, is sold in about every country in the world.\r\n\r\nThe commercial part of handling the cotton-crop begins within a very\r\nfew weeks from the time of the first picking. The baled cotton is hauled\r\nby team from the plantation to the nearest market-town, an item\r\nsometimes greater than the entire freightage from the nearest seaport to\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\nThe season for export lasts from September until the middle of January,\r\nduring which time brokers are visiting the smaller markets in order to\r\nbuy it on commission. It is then shipped by rail or by river to the\r\nnearest general market, where it is sold to the foreign buyers and\r\ndomestic manufacturers.\r\n\r\n_New Orleans_, the metropolis of the South, has usually the heaviest\r\nexport of cotton, amounting to about one billion pounds each year. Much\r\nof this is received by water from the various river-ports. The city is\r\nnot only a river-port, but an important seaport as well, controlling a\r\nlarge part of the foreign commerce of the Gulf. Several trunk lines of\r\nrailway enter the city, which is a receiving and distributing depot for\r\nboth Atlantic and Pacific freights. A considerable part of the former\r\nare sent by ocean steamships from New York. An elaborate system of\r\nsewerage, well-paved streets, and a good water-supply--all recently put\r\ninto operation--have made the city one of the most attractive in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n_Galveston_ is destined to become a leading port for cotton export. It\r\nhas the advantage of a fine harbor on the seaboard, and the disadvantage\r\nof a location so low that very heavy south winds flood the streets with\r\nwater from the Gulf. The growth of the export trade is due chiefly to\r\nthe increasing crop of Texas. Shipments from Galveston begin in\r\nSeptember, the Texas crop being the first to mature. _Savannah_ and _New\r\nYork_ rank next in their exports. _Pensacola_ and _Brunswick_ are also\r\nimportant points of export. _Memphis_, _Vicksburg_, _Shreveport_,\r\n_Houston_, and _Montgomery_ are important collecting stations for the\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nAbout one-third of the crop is retained for manufacture in the United\r\nStates; one-third is purchased by Great Britain, one-sixth by Germany,\r\nand most of the remainder by France, Italy, Spain, and Japan. Of the\r\nmanufactured cotton goods, the Chinese are the heaviest buyers, taking\r\nabout half the entire export. Most of the Chinese purchase is landed at\r\nShanghai.\r\n\r\nIn the main, the manufactures of this region closely concern the cotton\r\nindustry. The increase in the manufacture of textile goods has been very\r\ngreat, and a large part of the cotton now manufactured in the New\r\nEngland States and abroad, in time will be made in the cities and towns\r\nof this section. In addition to the textile goods, cottonseed-oil is an\r\nimportant product. A part of this is used in the mechanical arts, but\r\nthe refined oil is used mainly for domestic purposes. A considerable\r\npart of the latter is used to adulterate olive-oil, and in some\r\ninstances is substituted for it. The refuse of the seed is made into\r\nfertilizer.\r\n\r\n_Atlanta_ is one of the foremost cities in the South in the manufacture\r\nof cotton textiles and products. Commercially its situation resembles\r\nthat of Indianapolis; it is a focal point of the chief trunk lines of\r\nrailway in the South, and has the principal railway clearing-house. Like\r\nNew Orleans, it is an educational centre and one of the foremost in the\r\nSouth. _Macon_, _Dallas_, _Fort Worth_, and _San Antonio_ are growing\r\ncommercial centres.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of cane-sugar has been an industry of Louisiana for more\r\nthan a century. Since the advent of beet-sugar, however, it has been a\r\nsomewhat precarious venture, and has depended for existence very largely\r\nupon tariff protection and bounties paid to the American sugar-makers.\r\nTobacco manufacture centres at Tampa and Key West. Cuban leaf is there\r\nconverted into cigars.\r\n\r\nFruit culture is a great industry. Millions of melons and great\r\nquantities of pineapples, oranges, and small fruit form the early crop\r\nthat is shipped North. The orange groves are mainly in Florida. The crop\r\nis exhausted about the time that California oranges are shipped East. A\r\ngreat deal of tropical fruit is brought from Mexican, Central American,\r\nand South American ports. This trade is controlled mainly at _Mobile_,\r\nwhich is also a lumber-market.\r\n\r\n=The Arid Plains and the Grazing Region.=--This region includes the high\r\nplains approximately west of the 2,000-foot contour of level, together\r\nwith a part of the plateaus of the western highland region. It is\r\nessentially one of grazing. Formerly there was an attempt to make\r\nwheat-growing the chief industry, but on account of the limited rainfall\r\nnot more than three crops out of five reached maturity.\r\n\r\nThe earlier cattle-growing was carried on in a somewhat primitive\r\nmanner; the cattle herded on open lands, wandering from one range to\r\nanother, wherever the grazing might be good. The ownership of the cattle\r\nwas determined by the brand the animal bore,[53] and the herds were\r\n"rounded up" twice a year to be sorted; at the round-up the "mavericks,"\r\nor unmarked calves and yearlings, were branded. In time the ranges\r\nbecame greatly overstocked; the winter losses by starvation were so\r\nheavy that a better system became imperative. "Rustling," or\r\ncattle-stealing, also became a factor in improving the methods of\r\ncattle-ranching. The cautious rustler would purchase a few head of\r\ncattle and add to the number by capturing stray mavericks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DESERT REGION--TOO DRY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF\r\nFOOD-STUFFS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPEN GRAZING RANGES, IN WESTERN HIGHLANDS]\r\n\r\nBoth the legitimate graziers and the rustlers at first were bitterly\r\nopposed to fencing the land. In time, however, the grazier was compelled\r\nto do this, and also to grow alfalfa for winter foddering. The great\r\nopen ranges have therefore been broken up and fenced wholly or in part.\r\nThe fencing, moreover, has kept a dozen or more of the largest\r\nwire-mills in the world turning out a product that is at once shipped\r\nWest. As a rule, the top wire is set on insulators and used for\r\ntelephone connection.[54] This method of cattle-growing has improved the\r\nbusiness in every way. The cattle are better kept; the loss by winter\r\nkilling is very small; the "long-horn" cattle have given place to the\r\nbest breeds of "meaters," which are heavier, and mature more quickly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright, 1901, by Detroit Photographic Co._\r\n\r\nON A TEXAS CATTLE RANCH]\r\n\r\nThe success of stock-growing in this region is largely a question of\r\nclimate. The sparse rainfall permits the growth of several species of\r\ngrass that retain nutrition and vitality after turning brown under the\r\nfierce summer heat. Ordinary turf-grass will not live in this region,\r\nnor will it retain its nutrition after turning brown if rain falls upon\r\nit. The native grass is not materially affected by a shower or two; it\r\nis fairly good fodder even when buried under the winter\'s snow. The\r\nexistence of this industry, therefore, turns on a very delicate climatic\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nOf the beef grown in the United States the export product is derived\r\nmainly from this region. Nearly four hundred thousand animals are\r\nshipped alive; about three hundred million pounds of fresh beef are\r\nshipped to the Atlantic seaboard in refrigerator-cars and then\r\ntransferred to refrigerator-steamships. Two-thirds of the cattle and\r\nfresh beef exported are shipped from New York and Boston.\r\n\r\nUpward of one hundred and fifty million pounds of canned and pickled\r\nbeef are also exported. All but a very small part of this product is\r\nconsumed in Great Britain, France, and Germany. The cattle are collected\r\nfor transportation at various stations and sidings along the railways\r\nthat traverse this region. _Cheyenne_ is one of the largest\r\ncattle-markets in the world.\r\n\r\nWool has become a very valuable product, and the sheep grown in this\r\nregion number about one-half the total in the United States. The growing\r\nof macaroni-wheat is extending to lands that fail to produce crops of\r\nordinary wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nIn what ways does the basin of the Great Lakes facilitate the commerce\r\nof the United States?\r\n\r\nHow has the topography of the Mississippi Valley affected the evolution\r\nof farming-machinery?\r\n\r\nWhy are shippers willing in many cases to pay an all-rail rate on wheat\r\nsent to the Atlantic seaboard, nearly three times as great as the lake\r\nand canal rates?\r\n\r\nThe acre-product of wheat in the United States is about twelve bushels;\r\nin western Europe it varies from twenty-five to more than forty bushels;\r\nto what is the difference due?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by sea-island cotton?--for what reasons is cotton imported\r\nfrom Egypt and Peru into the United States?\r\n\r\nIn what manner is cotton used in the manufacture of pneumatic tires, and\r\nwhy is it thus used?\r\n\r\nWhat are refrigerator-cars?--refrigerator-steamships?

The two highest\r\nranges, each about two miles high, enclose a basin-shaped plateau about\r\none mile high. This basin is commonly called the "plateau region." The\r\nrim ranges are broken in a few places by passes that the\r\ntranscontinental railways thread. West of the Sierra Nevada ranges are\r\nthe fertile Pacific coast lowlands.\r\n\r\n=The Plateau Region.=--This region is generally arid, but on the higher\r\nplateaus there is sufficient rainfall to produce a considerable forestry\r\nand grazing. The general conditions of rainfall and topography forbid\r\nany great development of agriculture. Farming is confined to the\r\nriver-flood-plains, the parks, and the old lake beds and margins.\r\n\r\nA considerable area, estimated at more than two million acres, may be\r\nmade productive by irrigation, and the United States Government is\r\nundertaking the construction of an elaborate and extensive system of\r\nreservoirs for the impounding of stream and storm waters now running to\r\nwaste. The irrigated lands of this region, when their products are\r\naccessible to markets, are very valuable. The river-bottom lands of New\r\nMexico, and the old margins of Great Salt Lake in Utah are examples.\r\nThey produce abundantly, and a single acre often yields as much as four\r\nor five acres in regions of plentiful rainfall.\r\n\r\nNot much of the crop of this region, the fruit and wool excepted,\r\nleaves the vicinity in which it is grown, on account of the expense of\r\ntransportation. In the matter of the transportation of their\r\ncommodities, the dwellers of the western highland are doubly\r\nhandicapped. The building of railways is enormously expensive, and in a\r\nregion of sparse population there is comparatively little local freight\r\nto be hauled. The difficulties of developing such a region from a\r\ncommercial stand-point, therefore, are very great.\r\n\r\nMining is the chief industry of this section, and silver, gold, and\r\ncopper are its most important products. Since the discovery of precious\r\nmetals in the United States, this region has produced gold and silver\r\nbullion to the value of about four billion dollars. This sum is about\r\none-half the value of the railways of the country,[55] and from 1865 to\r\n1880 a large part of the capital invested in railway building represents\r\nthe gold and silver of these mines. In the last twenty years of the past\r\ncentury they produced an average of about one hundred and twenty-five\r\nmillion dollars per year, and this average is constantly increasing.\r\n\r\nCoal-measures extend along the eastern escarpment of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and these are destined at no remote day to create a centre of\r\nsteel and other manufactures. Several of the railways operate coal-mines\r\nin Colorado and Wyoming for the fuel required. A limited supply of steel\r\nis also made, the industry being protected by the great distance from\r\nthe Eastern smelteries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD MINING--CRIPPLE CREEK, COLORADO]\r\n\r\n_Denver_ is the chief active centre of finance of the mining industry\r\nin the western highlands, although many of the great enterprises derive\r\nthe capital necessary to develop them from _New York_ and _San\r\nFrancisco_. _Leadville_, _Cripple Creek_, _Butte_, _Helena_, and\r\n_Deadwood_ are regions of gold and silver production. _Virginia City_ is\r\nthe operating centre of the famous Comstock mines. At _Anaconda_ is the\r\nchief copper-mine of this region. _Salt Lake City_ and _Ogden_ are the\r\ncentre of the Mormon agricultural enterprises. _Santa F\xc3\xa9_, _Las Vegas_,\r\nand _Albuquerque_ are centres of agricultural interests and\r\nstock-growing.\r\n\r\n_Spokane_ and _Walla Walla_ are commercial centres of the plains of the\r\nColumbia River. The former is the focal point of a network of local\r\nroads that collect the wheat and other farm products of this region; the\r\nlatter is the collecting point for much of the freight sent by\r\nsteamboats down the Columbia River from _Wallula_. Railway\r\ntransportation has largely superseded river-navigation for all except\r\nlocal freights, however. _Boise City_ is the financial centre of\r\nconsiderable mining interests.\r\n\r\n=The Pacific Coast Lowlands.=--Climatically this region differs from the\r\nrest of the United States in having a rainy and a dry season--that is,\r\nthe rainfall is wholly seasonal. In the northern part the rainfall is\r\nsixty inches or more, and rain may be expected daily from the middle of\r\nOctober to May. In central California the precipitation is about half as\r\nmuch, the rainy season beginning later and ending earlier. In southern\r\nCalifornia there are occasional showers during the winter months,\r\naggregating ten or twenty inches.\r\n\r\nThe level valley-lands have no superior for wheat-farming, and in but\r\none or two places is the rainfall insufficient to insure a good crop. In\r\nthe San Joaquin and southern valleys of California the harvest begins in\r\nMay, in the Sacramento Valley in June, and in the Willamette and Sound\r\nValleys of Oregon and Washington in July. The wheat goes mainly to Great\r\nBritain by way of Cape Horn. It cannot be safely shipped in bulk, and\r\nthe manufacture of jute grain-sacks has become an important industry in\r\nconsequence. The yearly wheat product of this region is not far from\r\neighty million bushels.\r\n\r\nFruit is a valuable product of the foot-hills of the Sierras, and in\r\nsouthern California oranges, lemons, and grapes are now the staple crop.\r\nIn some cases the average yield per acre has reached a value of five\r\nhundred dollars. Some of the largest vineyards in the world are in this\r\nregion. The Zinfandel claret wine and the raisins find a market as far\r\neast as London, and considerable quantities are sold in China and Japan.\r\nThe navel orange, although not native to California, reaches its finest\r\ndevelopment in that State. A large part of the fruit-crop of California\r\nis handled at Minneapolis, Chicago, St. Louis, and New York. It is\r\ntransported in special cars attached to fast trains.\r\n\r\nWool is an important crop. In the northern part the sheep thrive best in\r\nthe foot-hills. The valley of Umpqua River, Ore., produces nearly\r\nseventeen million pounds of wool yearly, the staple being an ordinary\r\nvariety. California produces nearly as much of the finest merino staple.\r\nA considerable part is manufactured in the mills of the Pacific coast.\r\nThe Mission Mills blankets made in San Francisco are without an equal\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of gold by John Marshall in 1848 resulted in a tremendous\r\ninflow of people to the gold-fields of California. It also was a factor\r\nin the acquisition of the territory composing the Pacific coast States.\r\nThe first mining consisted merely in separating the metal deposited in\r\nthe bed-rock of streams by washing away the lighter material. In time\r\nthe quartz ledges which had produced the placer gold became the chief\r\nfactor in gold mining. California is still one of the leading States in\r\nthe production of gold. Quicksilver mining is an important feature of\r\nthe mining interests of the Pacific coast, and the mines of the coast\r\nranges produce about half the world\'s output.\r\n\r\nLumber manufacture is an important industry. Douglas spruce, commonly\r\nknown as "Oregon pine," grows profusely on the western slopes of the\r\nhigh ranges, the belt extending nearly to the Mexican border. It makes a\r\nmost excellent building-lumber, especially for bridge-timber and\r\nframework. Masts and spars of this material are used in almost every\r\nmaritime country. Sugar-pine is less common, but is abundant. It is\r\nlargely used for interior work. Several species of redwood occur in\r\ncentral California, confined to a limited area. The wood is fine-grained\r\nand makes a most beautiful interior finish.\r\n\r\n_San Francisco_ is the metropolis of the Pacific coast of the United\r\nStates. It is the terminus of the Santa F\xc3\xa9 and Union Pacific railways,\r\nand the centre of a network of local roads. Steamship lines connect the\r\ncity with Panama, the Hawaiian Islands, Japan, and Australian ports;\r\ncoast steamships reach to the various ports of Alaska, Oregon, and\r\nCalifornia. It is also the financial as well as the commercial centre of\r\nthe Pacific coast. _Los Angeles_ is the centre of the fruit-growing\r\nregion; its port is _San Pedro_. _Stockton_, _Port Costa_, and\r\n_Sacramento_, all on navigable waters, are wheat-markets. _Portland_\r\n(Ore.) is the metropolis of the basin of the Columbia and Willamette\r\nRivers. Navigation of the former is interrupted by falls or rapids at\r\n_Dalles_ and _Cascades_, but boats ascend as far as _Wallula_. The lower\r\nWillamette is also made navigable by means of a canal and locks at\r\nOregon Falls.\r\n\r\nPuget Sound is a "drowned valley," with an abundance of deep water. The\r\nscore or more of harbors are among the best in the world. _Seattle_ and\r\n_Tacoma_, the leading ports, are terminals of great transcontinental\r\nrailways, and also of the most important trade-route across the\r\ncontinent. Lines of steamships connect Seattle with Japan and China, and\r\nthe commerce passing through this gateway is drawn from a territory\r\nthat extends more than half-way around the world. These ports are\r\ndestined to become the chief American ports in the Asian trade.\r\n\r\n=Alaska.=--The most productive industry of the insular part of the\r\nterritory is the fisheries. For many years the Pribilof Islands produced\r\npractically all the seal-pelts used in the manufacture of seal-fur\r\ngarments. So many seals were killed, however, that the species seemed\r\nlikely to become extinct, and seal-catching has been forbidden for a\r\nterm of years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUGET SOUND]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of gold along the Klondike River and in the beach-sands of\r\nCape Nome was followed by the development of surface mines that produced\r\na large amount of gold. For the better transportation of products, a\r\nrailway has been completed from _Skagway_ across White Pass to _White\r\nHorse_, the head of navigation of the Yukon. About twenty steamboats are\r\nengaged in the commerce of the river. _Skagway_ and _Dyea_ are\r\ncollecting points for the commerce of the Klondike mines. _Juneau_ has\r\nprobably the largest quartz-mill in the world.\r\n\r\n=Porto Rico.=--Porto Rico, formerly a Spanish colony, is now a possession\r\nof the United States. The island is about the size of Connecticut and\r\nhas a population somewhat greater. The industries are almost wholly\r\nagricultural, and nearly the whole surface is under cultivation. Sugar,\r\ncoffee, and tobacco are grown for export, and these constitute the chief\r\nsource of income. The coffee-crop, about sixty million pounds yearly, is\r\nthe most valuable product and commands a high price on account of its\r\nsuperior quality. It is sold very largely to European coffee-merchants,\r\nand is marketed as a "Mocha." Exports of fruit to the United States are\r\nincreasing. In 1900 the exports to United States markets, mainly sugar\r\nand cattle products, were about six million dollars. The imports from\r\nthe United States were chiefly of cotton-prints and rice, to the amount\r\nof nearly nine million dollars. The total export and import trade that\r\nyear was about twenty million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe facilities for the transportation of products are not good. The\r\nrailway lines have a total mileage of about one hundred and fifty miles.\r\nAn excellent wagon-road, built by the Spanish Government from San Juan\r\nto Ponce, has been supplemented by several hundred miles of roads built\r\nunder the direction of the military authorities. _San Juan_ and _Ponce_\r\nare the leading seaports and centres of trade.\r\n\r\n=Hawaiian Islands.=--These islands were discovered by a Spanish sailor,\r\nGaetano, in 1549, and again visited by Captain Cook in 1778. Up to 1893\r\nthey formed a native kingdom. In 1893 foreign influence was sufficient\r\nto overthrow the native government, and in 1898 they were formally\r\nannexed to the United States and about the same time organized as a\r\nterritory. From an early date the geographic position of the islands has\r\nmade them a convenient mid-ocean post-station, and they have therefore\r\nbecome a most important commercial centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HYDRAULIC GOLD MINING--CALIFORNIA]\r\n\r\nOf the various islands composing the group, Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, Kaui,\r\nMolokai, Lanai, and Niihau are inhabited. About one-fifth of the\r\npopulation consists of native Hawaiians; a little more than one-fifth is\r\nwhite; the remainder is composed of Japanese, Chinese, and Porto Ricans.\r\nThe native population is decreasing. About ninety-five per cent. of the\r\nproperty is owned by the white people--Americans, English, and Germans.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic soils are the very best sugar-lands, and a large amount of\r\ncapital is invested in this industry. The sugar-plantations employ more\r\nthan forty thousand laborers, all Japanese, Chinese, and Porto Ricans.\r\nThe value of the sugar export is nearly twenty-five million dollars\r\nyearly; that of fruit, rice, and hides is about two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand dollars. Coffee is rapidly becoming a leading product. The bulk\r\nof the imports comes from the United States, and consists of clothing,\r\ncotton textiles, lumber, and machinery.\r\n\r\n_Honolulu_, on the island of Oahu, is the capital and commercial centre,\r\nand foreign steamships and sailing-craft are scarcely ever absent from\r\nits harbor. Regular steamship service connects this port with San\r\nFrancisco, Seattle, Vancouver, B.C., and the principal ports of China\r\nand Japan. It is connected with the other islands by a system of\r\nwireless telegraphy. The city has the best of schools, business\r\norganizations, hotels, and streets.\r\n\r\n_Pearl Harbor_ contains a large area of water, most of which is deep\r\nenough for the largest vessels afloat. It is intended to deepen the\r\nentrance and establish a United States naval station at this place. The\r\nvillage of _Hilo_ is the chief port of the island of Hawaii.\r\n\r\n=The Philippine Islands= are an archipelago of about two thousand islands,\r\nthe two largest of which, Luzon and Mindanao, are each nearly the size\r\nof New York State. Luzon is by far the most important.\r\n\r\nAfter their cession to the United States (December 10, 1898), they were\r\nheld under military control, but this has given place to local\r\nself-government as rapidly as the circumstances permitted. A general\r\nschool system has been established and is extended wherever practicable.\r\nIn a considerable number of the islands civil organization is still\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal islands and their mineral resources:\r\n\r\n  ----------------+----------------------+---------------------\r\n        NAME      |CHIEF CITIES AND PORTS|MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n  ----------------+----------------------+---------------------\r\n  Luzon           |Manila, Lipa, Batangas|Coal, gold, copper\r\n  Mindanao        |Zamboanga             |Coal, gold, copper\r\n  Samar           |Catbalogan            |Coal, gold\r\n  Negros          |Bacolor               |Coal\r\n  Panay           |Iloilo                |Coal, gold, petroleum\r\n  Leyte           |Tacloban              |Coal, petroleum\r\n  Mindoro         |Calapan               |Coal, gold\r\n  Cebu            |Cebu                  |Coal, petroleum, gold\r\n  ----------------+----------------------+----------------------\r\n\r\nThe native population is mainly of the Malay race, but there are also\r\nmany Negritos. Of the native element the Tagals are the most advanced,\r\nand are the dominant people. The foreign population includes nearly one\r\nhundred thousand Chinese, who are the chief commercial factors of the\r\nislands, and the leading industries are controlled by them. There is a\r\nconsiderable population of Chinese and Tagal mixed blood, commonly known\r\nas "Chinese mestizos"; they inherit, in the main, the Chinese\r\ncharacteristics. The European and American population consists mainly of\r\nofficials, troops, and merchant-agents for Philippine products.\r\n\r\nThe principal products for export are "Manila" hemp, sugar, and tobacco.\r\nThe hemp is used in the manufacture of cordage and paper. On account of\r\nthe great strength of the fibre it has no equal among cordage fibres.\r\nThe imports from the United States consist mainly of machinery and\r\ncotton textiles. The total trade of the islands amounted in 1901 to\r\nabout fifty million dollars, most of which was shared by Great Britain\r\nand the United States.\r\n\r\nCoal is mined in the island of Cebu and is abundant in most of the\r\nislands. Iron ore, copper, and sulphur occur, but they have not been\r\nmade commercially available to any extent. Gold is mined in the island\r\nof Luzon. A stable government only is needed to make these great\r\nresources productive. An abundance of timber is found in most of the\r\nislands. Cedar, ebony, and sapan-wood are available for ornamental\r\npurposes; there is also a great variety of economic woods.\r\n\r\n_Manila_ is the commercial centre. Manila Bay is one of the finest\r\nharbors in the Pacific Ocean, but much work is necessary to give the\r\nwater-front a navigable depth for large steamships. With an improved\r\nharbor the city is bound to be a great emporium of Oriental trade.\r\nSteamship lines connect the city with Hongkong, Australia, Japan,\r\nSingapore, and Liverpool. There is also a military transport service to\r\nSeattle. A railway to Dagupan extends through the most important\r\nagricultural region. The wagon-roads throughout the island are very\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n_Lipa_, _Batanzas_, _Bauan_, and _Cavit\xc3\xa9_ are cities of about forty\r\nthousand population, all more or less connected with the industries of\r\nManila. _Iloilo_ is the second port of importance of the islands, and is\r\nthe centre of a considerable export trade in tobacco, hemp, sugar, and\r\nsapan-wood. _Cebu_ is also a port having a considerable trade.\r\n\r\n=Tutuila=, one of the Samoan Islands, was acquired by treaty for use as a\r\ncoal-depot and naval station. _Pago Pago_ is a port of call for\r\nsteamships between San Francisco and Australia. =Guam=, one of the Ladrone\r\nIslands, is a naval station. These possessions are strategic and are\r\ndesigned to secure the interests of the United States in the Pacific. An\r\nocean telegraphic cable connects the Pacific Ocean possessions with the\r\nUnited States and Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhy are mountain-regions apt to be sparsely peopled?\r\n\r\nWhy are arid regions sparsely peopled, as a rule?\r\n\r\nWhy are not gold-mining settlements so apt to be permanent as\r\nagricultural settlements?\r\n\r\nFrom the Abstract of Statistics find the production of gold and silver\r\nof this region for each ten years ending the last half of the century.\r\n\r\nWhat causes the difference between the wool clip of southern California\r\nand that of the Eastern States?\r\n\r\nFollow the route of a grain-carrying ship from San Francisco to\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages to the United States of the accession of the\r\nHawaiian Islands?--of the Philippine Islands?--of Alaska?

The general conditions of\r\ntopography resemble those of the United States--a central plain between\r\nthe high Rocky Mountain ranges in the west and the lower Laurentian\r\nranges in the east.\r\n\r\nCanada is an agricultural country, and because of the great skill with\r\nwhich its resources have been made commercially available, it is the\r\nmost important colony of Great Britain. The basin of the Great Lakes and\r\nthe St. Lawrence River is the most populous part of the country. This\r\nregion is highly cultivated and produces dairy products, beef, and the\r\nordinary farm-crops.\r\n\r\nFrom Lake Winnipeg westward, nearly to the Rocky Mountains, the land is\r\na succession of prairies admirably suited to wheat-growing.[56] The\r\nwheat is a hard, spring variety, and the average yield per acre is about\r\none-fourth greater than the average yield in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe area of forestry includes the larger remaining part of the great\r\npine belt, together with a very heavy reserve of merchantable\r\noak-timber. The part of the forest area in Canada aggregates one and\r\none-quarter million square miles, and yields an annual product of about\r\neighty million dollars; about one-third of the lumber is exported.\r\n\r\nThe northerly region of Canada produces furs and pelts. As long ago as\r\n1670, Charles II. granted to Prince Rupert and a stock company the lands\r\ncomprising a very large part of Canada around Hudson Bay, and secured to\r\nthem the sole right to trap the fur-bearing animals of the region. In\r\ntime the company, known as the Hudson Bay Company, transferred all its\r\nlands to Canada, and out of the domain thus annexed various provinces\r\nand unorganized districts have been created.\r\n\r\nThe company now exists as a corporation for the merchandise of furs. For\r\nthe greater part, Indians are employed as hunters and trappers, and the\r\npelts are collected at the various trading-posts, known as "houses" and\r\n"factories," to be sent to the head-quarters of the company near\r\nWinnipeg. Nearly every Arctic animal furnishes a merchantable pelt. The\r\ncheaper skins are made into garments in Canada and the United States;\r\nthose commonly classed as furs are sold in London. Several other fur\r\ncompanies are also operating in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe fisheries of the coast-waters and the Great Lakes are among the most\r\nproductive in the world. Everything within the three-mile limit of the\r\nshore is reserved for Canadian fishermen. The smaller bays and coves are\r\nreserved also within the three-mile limit. Beyond this limit the waters\r\nare open to all, and a fleet of swift gun-boats is necessary to prevent\r\nillicit fishing. Salmon, cod, lobsters, and herring form most of the\r\ncatch, amounting in value to upward of twenty million dollars yearly.\r\n\r\nThe output of minerals varies from year to year; since 1900 it has\r\naveraged about sixty million dollars a year. The gold product\r\nconstitutes nearly one-half and the coal about one-sixth of the total\r\namount. Nickel, petroleum, silver, and lead form the rest of the output.\r\nIron ore is abundant, but it is not at present available for production\r\non account of the distance from transportation.\r\n\r\nCommerce is facilitated by about eighteen thousand miles of railway and\r\nnearly three thousand miles of canal and improved river-navigation. One\r\nocean-to-ocean railway, the Canadian Pacific, is in operation; another,\r\nan extension of the Grand Trunk, is under way. The rapids and shoals of\r\nthe St. Lawrence and Richelieu Rivers are surmounted by canals and\r\nlocks. Welland Canal connects Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, and the\r\nCanadian lock at St. Mary\'s Falls joins Lake Superior to Lake Huron. By\r\nmeans of the lakes and canals vessels drawing fourteen feet may load at\r\nCanadian ports and discharge at Liverpool.\r\n\r\nThe harbors of the Atlantic coast have two great drawbacks--ice and high\r\ntides. Some of the steamship lines make Portland, Me., their winter\r\nterminus. The Pacific coast harbors are not obstructed by ice. An\r\nattempt has been made in the direction of using Hudson Bay and Strait as\r\na grain-route, but the difficulties of navigation are very great and the\r\nroute is open only two months of the year.\r\n\r\nPractically all the foreign trade is carried on with Great Britain and\r\nthe United States. The trade with each aggregates about one hundred and\r\nfifty million dollars yearly. The exports are lumber and wood-pulp,\r\ncheese and dairy products, wheat and flour, beef-cattle, hog products,\r\nfish, and gold-quartz. The chief imports are steel, wool, sugar, and\r\ncotton manufactures.\r\n\r\nPolitically, Canada consists of a number of provinces, each with the\r\nusual corps of elective officers. A governor-general appointed by the\r\nCrown of Great Britain is the chief executive officer.\r\n\r\n=Nova Scotia.=--This province is prominent on account of its coal and\r\niron, and also because of its geographic position. The iron and coal are\r\nutilized in steel smelteries and rolling-mills, glass-factories,\r\nsugar-refineries, and textile-mills. It is one of the few localities in\r\nthe eastern part of the continent yielding gold. _Halifax_, the capital,\r\nhas one of the best harbors of the Atlantic coast of North America; it\r\nis not often obstructed by ice, and is the chief winter port. Halifax is\r\nthe principal British naval station of North America, and this fact adds\r\nmuch to its commercial activity.\r\n\r\n=Prince Edward Island.=--The industries of this province are mainly\r\nconnected with the coast-fisheries. During the summer the island is\r\nvisited by thousands of fishing-vessels for the purpose of preparing the\r\ncatch for market. Fertilizer manufactured from the refuse is an\r\nincidental product. _Charlottetown_ is the capital.\r\n\r\n=New Brunswick.=--Fisheries and forest products are both resources of this\r\nprovince. Coal is mined at _Grand Lake_, and an excellent lime for\r\nexport to the United States is made at _St. John_. Lumber, wood-pulp,\r\nwooden sailing-vessels, cotton textiles, and structural steel for\r\nship-building are manufactured. A ship railway, seventeen miles long,\r\nacross the isthmus that connects this province to Nova Scotia, is under\r\nconstruction. _St. John_, the capital, is the chief seat of trade.\r\n\r\n=Quebec.=--This province was once a possession of France, and in the\r\ngreater part of it French customs are yet about as prevalent as they\r\nwere a century ago; moreover, the French population is increasing\r\nrapidly. The English-speaking population lives mainly along the Vermont\r\nborder. As a rule the English are the manufacturers and traders; the\r\nFrench people are the farmers.\r\n\r\n_Montreal_ is the head of navigation of the St. Lawrence for ocean\r\nsteamships. It is also the chief centre of manufactures. These are\r\nmainly sugar, rubber goods, textiles, light steel wares, and leather.\r\nThe last-named goes almost wholly to Great Britain; the rest are\r\nconsumed in Canada and the border American States. _Quebec_ is the most\r\nstrongly fortified city of the Dominion.\r\n\r\n=Ontario.=--This province is a peninsula bordered by Lakes Huron, Erie,\r\nand Ontario. Farming is the chief employment, and barley is an important\r\nproduct. Most of it is used in the manufacture of malt, and "Canada\r\nmalt" is regarded as the best. Several of the trunk railways whose\r\nterminals are in the United States traverse this peninsula. _Toronto_,\r\nthe capital and commercial centre, is one of the most rapidly growing\r\ncities of North America. _Hamilton_ owes its existence to its harbor and\r\nposition at the head of Lake Ontario. _Ottawa_ is the capital of the\r\nDominion. At _Sudbury_ are the nickel-mines that are among the most\r\nproductive in the world.\r\n\r\n=Manitoba=, =Saskatchewan=, and =Alberta=.--These provinces include the\r\nlevel prairie lands of the Saskatchewan and the Red River of the North.\r\nThey comprise the great grain-field of Canada. A considerable part of\r\nthe wheat-growing lands are yet unproductive owing to the lack of\r\nrailways. Much of the product is carried to market by the Canadian\r\nPacific and its feeders, but a considerable part finds its way to the\r\nNorthern Pacific and Great Northern roads. The coal of Manitoba and\r\nAlberta is an important fuel supply not only to the provinces and states\r\nsurrounding, but to the railways above named. A good quality of\r\nanthracite coal is also mined in Alberta. _Winnipeg_, the metropolis of\r\nthe region, is one of the great railway centres of Canada.\r\n\r\n=British Columbia.=--British Columbia, the Pacific coast province, has\r\nseveral resources of great value. The gold mines led to its settlement\r\nand commercial opening. The salmon-fisheries are surpassed by those of\r\nthe United States only. The beds of lignite coal have produced a very\r\nlarge part of the coal used in the Pacific coast States. The forests\r\nproduce lumber for shipment both to the Atlantic coast of America and\r\nthe Pacific coast of Asia.\r\n\r\n_Vancouver_, the terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway, is connected\r\nwith various Asian ports by fast steamships. _Nanaimo_, _Wellington_,\r\nand _Commox_ are the centres of the coal-mining industry. The\r\ncopper-mines at _Rossland_ produce most of the copper mined in Canada.\r\n\r\n=Newfoundland.=--Although a Crown possession, Newfoundland is not a member\r\nof the Dominion of Canada. The extensive fisheries are its chief\r\nresource. The Labrador coast, which is used as a resort for curing and\r\npreserving the catch, is attached to Newfoundland for the purpose of\r\ngovernment. _St. Johns_ is the capital.\r\n\r\nThe islands of Miquelon and St. Pierre, south of Newfoundland, are a\r\nFrench possession. Fishing is the ostensible industry, but a great deal\r\nof smuggling is carried on.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat, if any, climatic or topographic boundaries separate Canada and the\r\nUnited States?\r\n\r\nWhich of the two countries is the more fortunately situated for the\r\nproduction of food-stuffs?\r\n\r\nWhich will support the larger population?--why?\r\n\r\nThe harbors of the Labrador coast and of Cape Breton Island are superior\r\nto those of the British Islands, situated in about the same latitude;\r\nwhy do the latter have a commerce far greater than that of the former?\r\n\r\nCompare the industries of the eastern, middle, and western regions of\r\nCanada with the corresponding regions of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL REFERENCE\r\n\r\nStatesman\'s Year-Book.\r\n\r\nStatistical Year-Book of Canada (official government publication,\r\nOttawa).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nMEXICO--CENTRAL AMERICA--WEST INDIES\r\n\r\n\r\nMexico and the Central American states occupy the narrow, southerly part\r\nof North America. Structurally they consist of a plateau about a mile\r\nhigh, bordered on each side by a low coast-plain. The table-land, or\r\n_tierra templada_, has about the same climate as southern California;\r\nthe low coast-plains, or _tierra caliente_, are tropical.\r\n\r\n=Mexico.=--The United States of Mexico is the most important part of this\r\ngroup. The people are of mixed Spanish and Indian blood, but there are\r\nmany families of pure Castilian descent. The latter, in general, are the\r\nlanded proprietors; the former constitute the tradesmen, herders, and\r\npeons. There is also a large unproductive class, mainly of Indians, who\r\nare living in a savage state. In general the manners and customs are\r\nthose of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural pursuits are in a backward condition, partly for the\r\nwant of good system and an educated people, but mainly for lack of the\r\ncapital and engineering skill to construct the irrigating canals that\r\nare needed to make the land productive. Maize, rice, sugar (cane and\r\npanocha), and wheat are grown for home consumption.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural products which connect Mexico with the rest of the\r\nworld are sisal-hemp (henequin), coffee, logwood, and fruit. Sisal-hemp\r\nis grown in the state of Yucatan, and has become one of its chief\r\nfinancial resources. Oaxaca coffee is usually sold as a "Mocha" berry.\r\nThe logwood goes mainly to British textile makers; and the fruit,\r\nchiefly oranges and bananas, finds a market in the large cities of the\r\nUnited States, to which large consignments of vanilla and tropical woods\r\nare also sent. Cattle are grown on more than twenty thousand ranches,\r\nand the greater part are sent alive to the markets of the United States.\r\nThe native long-horn stock is giving place to improved breeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEXICO]\r\n\r\nGold and silver are the products that have made Mexico famous, and the\r\nmines have produced a total of more than three billion dollars\' worth of\r\nprecious metal. The native methods of mining have always been primitive,\r\nand low-grade ores have been neglected. In recent years American and\r\nEuropean capital has been invested in low-grade mines, and the bullion\r\nproduction has been about doubled in value; it is now about one hundred\r\nmillion dollars yearly. Iron ore is abundant, and good coal exists.\r\n\r\nThe manufactures, at present of little importance, are growing rapidly.\r\nThe cotton-mills consume the home product and fill their deficiency from\r\nthe Texas crop. All the finer textiles, however, are imported. Most of\r\nthe commodities are supplied by the United States, Great Britain, and\r\nGermany, the first-named having about half the trade. Most of the\r\nhardware and machinery is purchased in the United States.\r\n\r\nRailway systems, with American terminal points at El Paso, San Antonio,\r\nand New Orleans, extend from the most productive parts of the country.\r\nOne of the most important railways crosses the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,\r\nand, in order to encourage commerce, the harbors at Coatzacoalcos and\r\nSalina Cruz have been deepened and improved. This interoceanic route is\r\ndestined to become a very important factor in commerce. It shortens the\r\nroute between European ports and San Francisco by six thousand miles,\r\nand between New York and San Francisco by twelve hundred miles.[57]\r\n\r\n_Mexico_, the capital, is the financial and commercial centre. _Vera\r\nCruz_ and _Tampico_ are connected with the capital by railway, but both\r\nhave very poor port facilities. Steamship lines connect the former with\r\nNew York, New Orleans, Havana, and French ports. It is the chief port of\r\nthe country. _Matamoros_ on the American frontier has a considerable\r\ncattle-trade. The crop of sisal-hemp is shipped mainly from _Progresso_\r\nand _Merida_. _Acapulco_, _Manzanillo_, and _Mazatlan_ for want of\r\nrailway connections have but little trade. The first-named is one of the\r\nbest harbors in the world. _Guadalajara_ has important textile and\r\npottery manufactures.\r\n\r\n=The Central American States.=--The physical features and climate of\r\nthese states resemble those of Mexico. The Spanish-speaking people live\r\nin the table-lands, where the climate is healthful. The coast-plain of\r\nthe Atlantic is forest-covered and practically uninhabited save by\r\nIndians. Guatemala is the most important state. A railway from _Puerto\r\nBarrios_, its Atlantic port, through its capital, _Guatemala_, to its\r\nPacific port, _San Jos\xc3\xa9_, is nearly completed. British Honduras is a\r\nBritish territory acquired mainly for the mahogany product, which is\r\nshipped from _Belize_. Honduras has great resources in mines, cultivable\r\nlands, and forests, but these are undeveloped. Salvador is the smallest\r\nbut most progressive state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUTE OF PROPOSED NICARAGUA CANAL.]\r\n\r\nNicaragua is politically of importance on account of the possibilities\r\nof an interoceanic canal. A treaty for this canal, involving both\r\nNicaragua and Great Britain, has already been signed by the powers\r\ninterested. Many engineers regard the Nicaragua as preferable to that of\r\nthe Panama canal. The shorter distance between New York and the Pacific\r\nports of the United States, a saving of about four hundred miles, is in\r\nits favor. The longer distance of transit and the dangers of navigating\r\nLake Nicaragua are against it. Costa Rica is favorably situated for\r\ncommerce, but its resources are not developed. A railway from _Puerto\r\nLimon_ is nearly completed to _Puenta Arenas_, an excellent harbor on\r\nthe Pacific side.\r\n\r\nCoffee, hides, mahogany, and fruit are the only products of importance\r\nthat connect these states with the rest of the world. About half the\r\ntrade goes to the United States. The Germans and English supply a\r\nconsiderable part of the textiles and manufactured articles. The coffee\r\nof Costa Rica is a very superior product. Much of the mahogany and\r\nforest products goes to Great Britain. Fruit-steamers call at the\r\nAtlantic ports for bananas, which are sold in New Orleans and the\r\nAtlantic cities.\r\n\r\n=The West Indies.=--The climate and productions of these islands are\r\ntropical in character. Sugar, fruit, coffee, tobacco, and cacao are the\r\nleading products. From the stand-point of the planter, the sugar\r\nindustry has been a history of misfortunes. The abolition of slavery\r\nruined the industry in many of the islands belonging to Great Britain.\r\nThe competition of the beet-sugar made in Europe drove the Cubans into\r\ninsurrection on account of the excessive taxes levied by the Spaniards,\r\nand ended in the Spanish-American War.\r\n\r\nThe fruit-crop--mainly pineapples, oranges, and grapefruit--is shipped\r\nto the United States. New York, Philadelphia, and the Gulf ports are the\r\ndestination of the greater part of it.\r\n\r\nCuba, the largest island, is one of the most productive regions of the\r\nworld. The famous "Havana" tobacco grows mainly in the western part,\r\nalthough practically all Cuban tobacco is classed under this name.\r\nAccording to popular opinion it is pre-eminently the best in flavor,\r\nand the price is not affected by that of other tobaccos.[58] About\r\ntwo-thirds of the raw leaf and cigars are purchased by the tobacco\r\nmanufacturers of the United States. _Havana_, _Santiago_, and\r\n_Cienfuegos_ are the shipping-ports; most of the export is landed at New\r\nYork, Key West, and Tampa.\r\n\r\nFrom 1900 to 1903 the small fraction of the sugar industry that survived\r\nthe war and the insurrection was crippled by the high tariff on sugar\r\nimported into the United States. The latter, which was designed to\r\nprotect the home sugar industry, was so high that the Cubans could not\r\nafford to make sugar at the ruling prices in New York. Hides, honey, and\r\nSpanish cedar for cigar-boxes are also important exports.\r\n\r\nThe United States is the chief customer of Cuba, and in turn supplies\r\nthe Cubans with flour, textile goods, hardware, and coal-oil. Smoked\r\nmeat from Latin America and preserved fish from Canada and Newfoundland\r\nare the remaining imports. There are no manufactures of importance. The\r\nrailways are mainly for the purpose of handling the sugar-crop.\r\n\r\n_Havana_, the capital and financial centre, is connected with New York,\r\nNew Orleans, and Key West by steamship lines. _Santiago_, _Matanzas_,\r\nand _Cienfuegos_ are ports having a considerable trade.\r\n\r\nThe British possessions in the West Indies are commercially the most\r\nimportant of the European possessions. The Bahamas are low-lying coral\r\nislands, producing but little except sponges, fruit, and sisal-hemp.\r\n_Nassau_, the only town of importance, is a winter resort. Fruit, sugar,\r\nrum, coffee, and ginger are exported from _Kingston_, the port of\r\nJamaica. _St. Lucia_ has probably the strongest fortress in the\r\nCaribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nBarbados produces more sugar than any other British possession in the\r\nWest Indies. The raw sugar, muscovado, is shipped to the United States.\r\nBermuda, an outlying island, furnishes the Atlantic states with onions,\r\nEaster lilies, and early potatoes. From Trinidad is obtained the\r\nasphaltum, or natural tar, that is used for street paving. Brea Lake,\r\nthe source of the mineral, is leased to a New York company. Sugar and\r\ncacao are also exported from Port of Spain. The products of St. Vincent\r\nand Dominica are similar to those of the other islands.\r\n\r\nThe French own Martinique (_Fort de France_) and Guadeloupe (_Basse\r\nTerre_). St. Thomas (_Charlotte Amalie_), St. Croix, and St. John are\r\nDanish possessions. Various attempts to transfer the Danish islands to\r\nthe United States have failed. They are admirably adapted for naval\r\nstations. The island of Haiti consists of two negro republics, Haiti and\r\nSan Domingo. The only important product is coffee. Most of the product\r\nis shipped to the United States, which supplies coal oil and textiles in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat part of the United States was formerly a possession of Mexico, and\r\nhow did it become a possession of the United States?\r\n\r\nFrom a cyclopedia learn the character of the political organization of\r\nMexico and the Central American states.\r\n\r\nFrom the report listed below find what commercial routes gain, and what\r\nones lose in distance by the Nicaragua, as compared with the Panama\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nFrom a good atlas make a list of the islands of the West Indies; name\r\nthe country to which each belongs, and its exports to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nThe Statesman\'s Year-Book.\r\n\r\nGreat Canals of the World--pp. 4058-4059.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH AMERICA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICA--THE ANDEAN STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its general surface features South America resembles North\r\nAmerica--that is, a central plain is bordered by low ranges on the east\r\nand by a high mountain system on the west. In the southern part,\r\nmidsummer is in January and midwinter in July. The mineral-producing\r\nstates are traversed by the ranges of the Andes and all of them except\r\nChile are situated on both slopes of the mountains.\r\n\r\n=Colombia.=--This republic borders both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific\r\nOcean. One port excepted, however, most of its commerce is confined to\r\nthe shores of the Caribbean Sea. The lowlands east of the Andes are\r\nadmirably adapted for grazing, and such cattle products as hides, horns,\r\nand tallow are articles of export. This region, however, even with the\r\npresent facilities for transportation, produces only a small fraction of\r\nthe products possible.\r\n\r\nThe intermontane valleys between the Andean ranges have the climate of\r\nthe temperate zone; wheat and sheep are produced. The chief industrial\r\ndevelopment, however, is confined to the lands near the Caribbean coast.\r\nCoffee, cacao, and tobacco are grown for export, the business of\r\ncultivation being largely controlled by Americans and Europeans. Rubber,\r\ncopaiba, tolu, and vegetable ivory[59] are gathered by Indians from the\r\nforests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PASS IN THE ANDES]\r\n\r\nThe montane region has long been famous for its mines of gold and\r\nsilver. The salt mines near Bogota are a government monopoly and yield a\r\nconsiderable revenue. Near the same city are the famous Muzo emerald\r\nmines.\r\n\r\nThe rivers are the chief channels of internal trade. During the rainy\r\nseason steamboats ascend the Orinoco to Cabugaro, about two hundred\r\nmiles from Bogota. About fifty steamboats are in commission on the\r\nMagdalena and its tributary, the Cauca. Mule trains traversing wretched\r\ntrails require from one to two weeks to transport the goods from the\r\nriver landings to the chief centres of population. Improvements now\r\nunder way in clearing and canalizing these rivers will add about five\r\nhundred miles of additional water-way. The railways consist of short\r\nlines mainly used as portages around obstructions of the rivers.\r\n\r\nAn unstable government and an onerous system of export taxes hamper\r\ntrade. Coffee, a leading product, goes mainly to Europe. Cattle\r\nproducts, and balsam of tolu are purchased mainly in the United States.\r\nGreat Britain purchases the gold and silver ores. The chief\r\nimports--textiles, flour, and petroleum--are purchased in the United\r\nStates. _Bogota_ and _Medellin_ are the largest cities. The isolation of\r\nthe region in which they are situated shapes the indifferent foreign\r\npolicy of the government. _Barranquilla_, _Sabanilla_, and _Cartagena_\r\nare the chief ports.\r\n\r\n=Panama.=--This state, formerly a part of Colombia, includes the isthmus\r\nof Panama. Geographically it belongs to North America, and practically\r\nit can be approached from Colombia by water only. The secession of\r\nPanama was brought about by the complications of the isthmian canal. A\r\ntreaty with the United States gives the latter sovereign control over\r\nthe canal and the strip of land ten miles wide bordering it. _Panama_\r\nand _Colon_ are the two ports of the canal. The United States exercises\r\npolice and sanitary regulations in these cities, but it has no\r\nsovereignty over them.\r\n\r\n=Peru.=--Peru has great resources, both agricultural and mineral. Cotton\r\nis one of the chief products. The ordinary fibre is excelled only by the\r\nsea-island cotton of the United States; the long-staple fibre of the\r\nPiura is the best grown. The former is generally employed for mixing\r\nwith wool in the manufacture of underwear, and is sold in the United\r\nStates and Europe; the latter, used in the manufacture of thread and the\r\nweb of pneumatic tires, goes mainly to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nCane-sugar is a very large export crop, Great Britain, the United\r\nStates, and Chile being the principal customers. The area of coffee\r\nproduction is growing rapidly. Coca-growing has become an important\r\nindustry, and the plantations aggregate about three million trees;[60] a\r\nlarge part of the product is sent to the chemical laboratories of the\r\nUnited States. A small crop of rice for export is grown on the coast.\r\n\r\nThe Amazon forest products yield a considerable revenue. Rubber and\r\nvegetable ivory are the most valuable. Cinchona, or Peruvian bark,\r\nhowever, is the one for which the state is best known; and there is\r\nprobably not a drug-shop in the civilized world that does not carry it\r\nin stock.[61]\r\n\r\nCattle are grown for their hides, and of these the United States is the\r\nchief purchaser. The wool of the llama, alpaca, and vicu\xc3\xb1a is used in\r\nmanufacture of the cloth known as alpaca, and the value of the shipments\r\nto Great Britain usually exceeds one million dollars a year. In the\r\nmining regions the llama is used as a pack-animal, and a large part of\r\nthe mine products reach the markets by this means of transportation. The\r\nmines yield silver and copper; in the main the ores are exported to\r\nGreat Britain to be smelted.\r\n\r\nThe products already named are the chief exports; the imports are cotton\r\ntextiles, machinery, steel wares, and coal-oil. Great Britain has about\r\none-half the foreign trade; the United States controls about one-fourth.\r\n_Callao_, the port of _Lima_, is the market through which most of the\r\nforeign trade is carried on. Steamship lines connect it with San\r\nFrancisco and with British ports. _Mollendo_ is the outlet of Bolivian\r\ntrade. The railways are short lines extending from the coast.\r\n\r\n=Ecuador.=--This state has but little commercial importance. The only\r\ncultivated products for export are cacao, coffee, and sugar. The\r\nfirst-named constitutes three-fourths of the exports, and most of it\r\ngoes to France. The land is held in large estates, and most of the\r\nlaboring people are in a condition of practical slavery. The\r\nbread-stuffs consumed by the foreign population and the land proprietors\r\nare imported. Animals are grown for their hides and these are sold to\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nAnother manufacture that connects Ecuador with the rest of the world is\r\nthe so-called "Panama" hat. The material used is toquilla straw, the\r\nmid-rib of the screw-pine (_Carlodovica palmata_). The prepared straw\r\ncan be plaited only when the atmosphere is very moist, and much of the\r\nwork is done at night. The hats are made by Indians, who are governed\r\nby their own ideas regarding style and shape. They bring from\r\ntwenty-five to fifty dollars apiece in the American markets, where\r\nnearly all the product is sold.[62]\r\n\r\nMule-paths are the only means of inland communication. There is a\r\nconsiderable local traffic on the estuaries of the rivers, but this is\r\nconfined to the rainy seasons. A railway built by an American company is\r\nin operation from _Guayaquil_, a short distance inland. This city is the\r\nchief market for foreign goods, and it is the only foreign port of the\r\nPacific coast of South America in which the volume of trade of the\r\nUnited States approximates that of Germany and Great Britain.\r\n\r\n=Bolivia.=--Bolivia lost much of its possible commercial possible future\r\nwhen, after a disastrous war, its Pacific coast frontage became a\r\npossession of Chile. The agricultural lands are unfortunately situated\r\nwith reference to the mining population; as a result, a considerable\r\namount of food-stuffs must be imported from Argentina. Coffee, cacao,\r\nand coca are the principal cultivated products. Rubber from the Amazon\r\nforest is the most valuable vegetable product, but a considerable amount\r\nof cinchona bark and ivory nuts are also exported.\r\n\r\nThe mines, however, are the chief wealth of the state and give it the\r\nonly excuse for its political existence. They produce silver, tin,\r\ncopper, gold, and borate of lime. Inasmuch as a large part of the ore\r\nand ore products must be transported by llamas and mules, only the\r\nrichest mines can be profitably worked. With adequate means of\r\ntransportation, the mines should make Bolivia one of the most powerful\r\nSouth American states.\r\n\r\nRailways already connect _Oruro_ with the sea-coast. A railway now\r\nunder construction will connect _La Paz_ (the pass) with the Pacific\r\ncoast, and also Buenos Aires. Excellent roads to take the place of the\r\npack-trains are under construction.\r\n\r\nPractically all the imports, consisting of cotton and woollen textiles,\r\nmachinery, and steel wares, are purchased in Great Britain. The exports\r\nare more than double the imports. Most of the goods pass through the\r\nChilean port Antofagasto, or Mollendo, Peru. _La Paz_, _Oruro_, and\r\n_Sucre_ are the chief cities.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical state of Acr\xc3\xa9 is situated in the angle where Bolivia,\r\nPeru, and Brazil join. The rubber forests, together with the absence of\r\nlegal government, led to its existence. The government is wholly\r\ninsurrectionary, but it at least uses its powers to encourage the rubber\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n=Chile.=--This state comprises the narrow western slope of the Andes,\r\nextending from the tropic of Capricorn to Cape Horn, a distance of about\r\nthree thousand miles. The resources of the state have been so skilfully\r\nhandled, that with the drawback of a very small proportion of cultivable\r\nland, Chile is the foremost Andean state.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the ordinary crops is confined to the flood-plains of\r\nthe short rivers. These, as a rule, are from twenty to fifty miles long\r\nand a mile or two in width. They are densely peopled and cultivated to\r\nthe limit. Between the river-valleys are long stretches of unproductive\r\nland.\r\n\r\nWithin the valleys wheat, barley, fruit, and various food-stuffs are\r\ngrown. Of these there are not only enough for home consumption, but\r\nconsiderable quantities are exported to Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. Much\r\nof the cultivable land requires to be watered, and the system of\r\nirrigation has been developed with extraordinary skill. The grazing\r\nlands are extensive. In the northern part an excellent quality of merino\r\nwool is produced; the greater part of the clip, however, is an ordinary\r\nfibre. The cattle furnish a considerable amount of leather for export.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which have made the northern part a desert have also\r\ngiven to the state its greatest resource--nitre.[63] The nitrate occurs\r\nin the northern desert region. The crude salt is crushed and partly\r\nrefined at the mines, and carried by rail to the nearest port. The\r\nworking of the nitrate beds is largely carried on by foreign companies.\r\nNearly all the product is used as a fertilizer in Germany, France, and\r\nGreat Britain. Nitrate constitutes about two-thirds of the exports.\r\nIodine and bromine are also obtained from the nitrates, and the Chilean\r\nproduct yields nearly all the world\'s supply.\r\n\r\nCopper is extensively mined and, next to the nitrates, is the most\r\nvaluable product. Great Britain is the customer for the greater part.\r\nCoal occurs in the southern part of the state, and is mined for export\r\nto the various states of the Pacific coast. It is not a good coal for\r\niron smelting, however, and about three times as much is imported as is\r\nexported. A considerable part of the imported coal comes from Australia,\r\nand with it structural steel is made from pig-iron that is also\r\nimported.\r\n\r\nChile is well equipped with railways, a part of which has been built and\r\nare operated by the state. The most important line traverses the valley\r\nbetween the Andes and the coast ranges, from Concepcion to Valparaiso.\r\nIn this region are most of the manufacturing enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe imports are chiefly coal, machinery, textile goods, and sugar. The\r\nBritish control about two-thirds of the foreign trade; the Germans and\r\nthe French have most of the remainder. The United States supplies the\r\nChileans with a part of the textiles, a considerable quantity of Oregon\r\npine, and practically all the coal-oil used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VALPARASIO]\r\n\r\n_Valparaiso_ is the chief business centre of the Pacific coast of South\r\nAmerica. Most of the forwarding business is carried on by British and\r\nGerman merchants. The transandine railway, now about completed, will\r\nmake it one of the most important ports of the world. _Santiago_ is the\r\ncapital. _Concepcion_ and _Talca_ are important centres of trade.\r\n_Chillan_ is the principal cattle-market of the Pacific coast of South\r\nAmerica. _Copiapo_ is the focal point of the mining interests. _Iquique_\r\nis the port from which about all the nitrates are shipped. _Punta\r\nArenas_, one of the "end towns" of the world, is an ocean post-office\r\nfor vessels passing through the Straits of Magellan. It is about as far\r\nsouth as Calgary, B.C., is north.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat will be the probable effect of an interoceanic canal on the\r\ncommerce of these states?\r\n\r\nFrom the Abstract of Statistics make a list of the exports from the\r\nUnited States to these countries.\r\n\r\nFrom the statistics of trade in the Statesman\'s Year-Book compare the\r\ntrade of the United States with that of other countries in these states.\r\n\r\nHow have race characteristics affected the commerce and development of\r\nthese states?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by peonage?\r\n\r\nWhat cities of the tropical part of these states are in the climate of\r\nthe temperate zone?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nCarpenter\'s South America.\r\n\r\nVincent\'s Around and About South America.\r\n\r\nFiske\'s Discovery of America--Chapters IX-X.\r\n\r\nProcure, if possible, specimens of the following: Cacao and its\r\nproducts, ivory nuts, cinchona bark, crude nitrate, Panama straw, iodine\r\n(in a sealed vial), llama wool, alpaca cloth, Peruvian cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICA--THE LOWLAND STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eastern countries of South America are mainly lowland plains. The\r\nllanos of the Orinoco and the pampas of Plate (La Plata) River are\r\ngrazing lands. The silvas of the Amazon are forest-covered. In tropical\r\nregions the coast-plain is usually very unhealthful; the seaports\r\nexcepted, most of the cities and towns are therefore built on higher\r\nland beyond the coast-plain.\r\n\r\n=Venezuela.=--The greater part of Venezuela is a region of llanos, or\r\ngrassy plains, shut off from the harbors of the Caribbean Sea, by\r\nmountain-ranges. On account of their pleasant climate the\r\nmountain-valleys constitute the chief region of habitation. The plains\r\nare flooded in the rainy season and sun-scorched during the period of\r\ndrought; they are therefore unfit for human habitation.\r\n\r\nCoffee is cultivated in the montane region; and cacao in the lower coast\r\nlands. Almost every part of the coast lowlands is fit for sugar\r\ncultivation, and in order to encourage this industry, the importation of\r\nsugar is forbidden. As is usual in similar cases, the domestic sugar is\r\npoor in quality and high in price. Among the forest products rubber,\r\nfustic, divi-divi,[64] and tonka beans, the last used as a perfume, are\r\nthe only ones of value. The cattle of the llanos, the native long-horns,\r\nfurnish a poor quality of hide, and poorer beef. A few thousand head are\r\nshipped yearly down the Orinoco to be sent to Cuba and Porto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe placer gold-mines of the Yuruari country, a region also claimed by\r\nGreat Britain, have been very productive. Coal, iron ore, and asphaltum\r\nare abundant. Concessions for mining the two last-named have been\r\ngranted to American companies. The pearl-fisheries around Margarita\r\nIsland, also leased to a foreign company, have become productive under\r\nthe new management.\r\n\r\nThe means of intercommunication are as primitive as those of Colombia.\r\nShort railways extend from several seaports to the regions of\r\nproduction, and from these coffee and cacao are the only exports of\r\nimportance. The Orinoco River is the natural outlet for the\r\ncattle-region, but the commerce of this region is small. The lagoon of\r\nMaracaibo is becoming the centre of a rapidly growing commercial region.\r\n\r\n_Caracas_, the capital and largest city, receives the imports of\r\ntextiles, domestic wares, flour, and petroleum from the United States\r\nand Great Britain. The railway to its port, _La Guaira_, is a remarkable\r\nwork of engineering. _Puerto Cabello_, the most important port, receives\r\nthe trade of _Valencia_. From _Maracaibo_, the port on the lagoon of the\r\nsame name, is shipped the Venezuelan coffee. _Ciudad Bolivar_ is the\r\nriver-port of the Orinoco and an important rubber-market.\r\n\r\n=The Guianas.=--The surface conditions and climate of the Guianas resemble\r\nthose of Venezuela. The native products are also much the same, but good\r\nbusiness organization has made the countries bearing the general name\r\nhighly productive. For the greater part, the coast-plain is the region\r\nof cultivation. Sugar is still the most important crop; but on account\r\nof the fierce competition of beet-sugar, on many of the plantations\r\ncane-sugar cultivation is unprofitable and has been abandoned for that\r\nof rice, cacao, and tobacco. Great Britain, Holland, and France possess\r\nthe country. The divisions are known respectively as British Guiana,\r\nSurinam, and Cayenne, and the trade of each accrues to the\r\nmother-country. British Guiana is noted quite as much for its\r\ngold-fields on the Venezuelan border (Cuyuni River) as for its vegetable\r\nproducts. _Georgetown_, better known by the name of the surrounding\r\ndistrict, _Demerara_, is the focal point of business. _New Amsterdam_ is\r\nalso a port of considerable trade. The gold-mining interests centre at\r\n_Bartica_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CACAO PLANTATION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING THE BEANS FOR SHIPMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CACAO-TREE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKING CHOCOLATE]\r\n\r\nSurinam, in addition to its export of vegetable products, contains rich\r\ngold-mines, and these contribute a considerable revenue. _Paramaribo_ is\r\nthe port and centre of trade. Phosphates and gold are among the\r\nimportant exports of Cayenne, whose port bears the same name.\r\n\r\n=Brazil.=--This state, nearly the size of the United States, comprises\r\nabout half the area of South America. Much of it, including the greater\r\npart of the Amazon River basin, is unfit for the growth of food-stuffs.\r\n\r\nThere are three regions of production. The Amazon forests yield the\r\ngreater part of the world\'s rubber supply. The middle coast region has\r\nvarious agricultural products, of which cotton and cane-sugar are the\r\nmost important. From the southern region comes two-thirds of the world\'s\r\ncoffee-crop. There are productive gold-mines in the state of Minas\r\nGeraes, but this region is best known for the "old mine" diamonds, the\r\nfinest produced.\r\n\r\nThe Amazon rubber-crop includes not only the crude gum obtained in\r\nBrazil, but a considerable part, if not the most, of the crop from the\r\nsurrounding states. The bifurcating Cassiquiare, which flows both into\r\nAmazonian and Orinocan waters, drains a very large area of forest which\r\nyields the best rubber known. The yield of 1901 aggregated about one\r\nhundred and thirty million pounds, of which about one-half was sold in\r\nthe United States, one-third in Liverpool, and the rest mainly in\r\nAntwerp and Le Havre. The price of rubber is fixed in New York and\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe cotton and cane-sugar are grown in the middle coast region. The\r\ncotton industry bids fair to add materially to the prosperity of the\r\nstate. A considerable part of the raw cotton is exported, but the\r\nreserve is sufficient to keep ten thousand looms busy. About three\r\nhundred and fifty million pounds of the raw sugar is purchased by the\r\nrefineries of the United States, and much of the remainder by British\r\ndealers.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of a species of myrtle (_Bertholletia excelsa_) furnish the\r\nBrazil nuts of commerce, large quantities of which are shipped to Europe\r\nand the United States.[65] Manganese ore is also an important export,\r\nand Great Britain purchases nearly all of it.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-crop of the southern states is the largest in the world; and\r\nabout eight hundred million pounds are landed yearly at the ports of the\r\nUnited States. The coffee-crop, more than any other factor, has made the\r\ngreat prosperity of the state; for while the rubber yield employs\r\ncomparatively few men and yields but little public revenue, the\r\ncoffee-crop has brought into Brazil an average of about fifty million\r\ndollars a year for three-quarters of a century.\r\n\r\nCattle products also afford a considerable profit in the vicinity of the\r\ncoffee-region. The hides and tallow are shipped to the United States.\r\nFor want of refrigerating facilities, most of the beef is "jerked" (or\r\nsun-dried), and shipped in this form to Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe facilities for transportation, the rivers excepted, are poor. The\r\nAmazon is navigable for ocean steamships nearly to the junction of the\r\nUcayale. The Paraguay affords a navigable water-way to the mouth of\r\nPlate River. Rapids and falls obstruct most of the rivers at the\r\njunction of the Brazilian plateau and the low plains, but these streams\r\nafford several thousand miles of navigable waters both above and below\r\nthe falls.\r\n\r\nNearly all the railways are plantation roads, extending from the various\r\nports to regions of production a few miles inland. The most important\r\nrailway development is that in the vicinity of Rio, where short local\r\nroads to the suburban settlements and the coffee-plantations converge at\r\nthe harbor. About fourteen thousand miles of railway are completed and\r\nunder actual construction. A considerable part of the mileage is owned\r\nand operated by the state, and it has become the policy of the latter to\r\ncontrol its roads and to encourage immigration. One result of this\r\npolicy is the increasing number of German and Italian colonies, that\r\nestablish settlements in every district penetrated by a new road.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the total foreign trade aggregated upward of two hundred and\r\nseventy-five million dollars. The imports consist of cotton and woollen\r\nmanufactures, structural steel and machinery, preserved fish and meats,\r\nand coal-oil. Great Britain, Germany, the United States, and France have\r\nnearly all the trade. The United States sells to Brazil textiles and\r\ncoal-oil to the amount of over eleven million dollars yearly, and buys\r\nof the country coffee and rubber to the amount of six times as much.\r\n\r\n_Rio de Janeiro_, commonly called "Rio," is the capital and commercial\r\ncentre. Its harbor is one of the best in South America. Formerly all the\r\ncoffee was shipped from this port, but the greater part now goes from\r\n_Santos_. _Porto Alegre_, the port of the German colonies, has also a\r\ngrowing export trade.\r\n\r\n_Bahia_, _Pernambuco_ (or _Recife_), _Maceio_, _Cear\xc3\xa1_ are the markets\r\nfor cotton, sugar, and tobacco, much of which is shipped to other\r\nBrazilian ports for home consumption. _Par\xc3\xa1_ and _Cear\xc3\xa1_ monopolize\r\nnearly all the rubber trade. The position of _Manaos_, at the confluence\r\nof several rivers, makes it one of the most important markets of the\r\nAmazon basin, and most of the crude rubber is first collected there for\r\nshipment. _Cuyaba_ is the commercial centre of the mining region; its\r\noutlet is the Paraguay River, and Buenos Aires profits by its trade.\r\n\r\n=Argentina and the Plate River Countries.=--These states are situated in a\r\nlatitude corresponding to that of the United States. The entire area\r\nfrom the coast to the slopes of the Andes is a vast prairie-region. As a\r\nresult of position, climate, and surface the agricultural industries are\r\nthe same as in the United States--grazing and wheat-growing.\r\n\r\nCattle-growing is the chief employment, and the cost per head of rearing\r\nstock is practically nothing. For want of better means of transportation\r\nthe shipments of live beef are not very heavy; the quality of the beef\r\nis poor, and until recently there have been no adequate facilities for\r\ngetting it to market.[66] A small amount of refrigerator beef and a\r\nlarge amount of jerked beef are exported, however. Near the markets,\r\nthere are large plants in which the hides, horns, tallow, and meat are\r\nutilized--the last being converted to the famous "beef extract," which\r\nfinds a market all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe sheep industry is on a much better business basis. Both the wool and\r\nthe mutton have been improved by cross-breeding with good stock. As a\r\nresult the trade in mutton and wool has increased by leaps and bounds;\r\nand nearly three million sheep carcasses are landed at the other ports\r\nof Brazil, at Cuba, and at various European states. The wool is bought\r\nmainly by Germany and France, but the United States is a heavy\r\npurchaser. The quality of the fibre, formerly very poor, year by year is\r\nimproving.\r\n\r\nWheat, the staple product, is grown mainly within a radius of four\r\nhundred miles around the mouth of Plate River. The area of cultivation\r\nis increasing as the facilities for transportation are extended and,\r\nlittle by little, is encroaching on the grazing lands. The wheat\r\nindustry is carried on very largely by German and Italian colonists.\r\nFlax, grown for the seed, is a very large export crop. Maize, partly for\r\nexport and partly for home consumption, is also grown.\r\n\r\nThe timber resources, chiefly in Paraguay and the Gran Chaco, are very\r\ngreat, but for want of means of transportation the timber-trade cannot\r\nsuccessfully compete with that of Central America and Mexico. Workable\r\ngold and silver ores are abundant along the Andean cordillera; gold,\r\nsilver, and copper are exported to Europe. A poor quality of lignite\r\noccurs in several provinces, but there are no available mines yielding\r\ncoal suitable for making steam. There are petroleum wells near Mendoza.\r\n\r\nMost of the manufactures pertain to the preparation of cattle products,\r\nalthough a considerable amount of coarse textiles are made in the larger\r\ncities from the native cotton and wool. Hats, paper (made from grass),\r\nand leather goods are also made. In general, all manufactures are\r\nhampered by the difficulties of getting good fuel at a low price.\r\n\r\nTransportation is carried on along Plate River and the lower parts of\r\nits tributaries. The railway has become the chief factor in the carriage\r\nof commodities, however, and the railways of Argentina have been\r\ndeveloped on the plans of North American roads. About twelve thousand\r\nmiles are in actual operation, one of which is a transcontinental line,\r\nabout completed between Buenos Aires and Valparaiso. Electric railways\r\nhave become very popular, and the mileage is rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\nThe import trade, consisting of textile goods, machinery, steel, and\r\npetroleum, is carried on with Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium\r\n(mainly transit trade), the United States, and Italy. The competition\r\nbetween the European states for this trade is very strong, and not a\r\nlittle has been acquired at the expense of the United States, whose\r\ntrade has not materially increased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AREA OF THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF MAT\xc3\x89]\r\n\r\n_Buenos Aires_ is the financial centre of this part of South America.\r\nAmong its industries is the largest meat-refrigerating plant in the\r\nworld. The harbor at _La Plata_ is excellent and has drawn a\r\nconsiderable part of the foreign trade from Buenos Aires. _Rosario_,\r\n_Cordoba_, _Santa F\xc3\xa9_, and _Parana_ are the markets of extensive farming\r\nregions. _Mendoza_ is the focal point of the mining interests.\r\n\r\n=Paraguay= has a large forest area, but for want of means of\r\ntransportation it is without value. Even the railway companies find it\r\ncheaper to buy their ties in the United States and Australia, rather\r\nthan to procure them in Paraguay. In spite of the extent of good land,\r\nthe wheat and much of the bread-stuffs are purchased from Argentina.\r\nTobacco and mat\xc3\xa9 are the only export crops, and they have but little\r\nvalue. The Parana and Paraguay Rivers are the only commercial outlet of\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\n=Uruguay.=--Owing to its foreign population Uruguay is becoming a rich\r\ncountry. The native cattle have been improved by cross-breeding with\r\nEuropean stock, and the state has become one of the foremost cattle and\r\nsheep ranges of the world. The value of animal products is not far from\r\nforty million dollars yearly. These go mainly to Europe, and so also\r\ndoes the wheat-crop.\r\n\r\nFrance and Argentina purchase most of the exports and Great Britain\r\nsupplies most of the textiles and machinery imported. The trade of the\r\nUnited States is about one-fourth that of Great Britain. _Montevideo_ is\r\nthe chief market and port. At _Fray Bentos_ is one of the largest plants\r\nin the world for the manufacture of cattle products.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat kind of commerce has led to the establishment of the various ports\r\nalong the Spanish Main?\r\n\r\nWhat advantages has the American fruit-shipper, trading at South\r\nAmerican ports, over his European competitor?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by "horse latitudes," and what was the origin of the name?\r\n\r\nIn what way may the opening of an interoceanic canal affect the\r\ncoffee-trade of Brazil?--the nitrate trade of Chile?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nFrom the Abstract of Statistics find the exports of the United States to\r\neach of these countries.\r\n\r\nFrom the Statesman\'s Year-Book compare the trade of the United States in\r\neach of these countries with that of Great Britain, France, Germany, and\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nIf possible, obtain specimens of the following: Crude rubber, pampas\r\ngrass, Brazil nuts (in pod), and raw coffee of several grades for\r\ncomparison with Java and Mocha coffees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nEUROPE--GREAT BRITAIN AND GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost all the commercial activity of Europe is south of the parallel\r\nand west of the meridian of St. Petersburg. Most of the great industries\r\nare controlled by Germanic and Latin peoples, and among these Great\r\nBritain and Germany stand first.\r\n\r\n=Great Britain and Ireland.=--The United Kingdom, or Great Britain and\r\nIreland, are commonly known as the British Isles. The British Empire\r\nconsists of the United Kingdom and its colonial possessions; it includes\r\nalso a large number of islands occupied as coaling stations and for\r\nstrategic purposes. All told, the empire embraces about one-seventh of\r\nthe land area of the world and about one-fourth its population.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful power and great commercial development is due not only to\r\nconditions of geographic environment but also to the intelligence of a\r\npeople who have adjusted themselves to those conditions. The insular\r\nposition of the United Kingdom has given it natural protection, and for\r\nmore than eight hundred years there has been no successful invasion by a\r\nforeign power. Its commercial position is both natural and artificial.\r\nIt has utilized the markets to the east and south, and has founded great\r\ncountries which it supplies with manufactured products.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRITISH EMPIRE]\r\n\r\nThe position of the kingdom with respect to climate is fortunate. The\r\nmovement of the Gulf Stream on the American coast carries a large volume\r\nof water into the latitude of the prevailing westerly winds, and these\r\nin turn carry warm water to every part of the coast of the islands. As a\r\nresult, the harbors of the latter are never obstructed by ice; those of\r\nthe Labrador coast, situated in the same latitude, are blocked nearly\r\nhalf the year.\r\n\r\nThe high latitude of the islands is an advantage so far as the\r\nproduction of food-stuffs is concerned. The summer days in the latitude\r\nof Liverpool are very nearly eighteen hours in length, and this fact\r\ntogether with the mild winters, adds very largely to the food-producing\r\npower of the islands.\r\n\r\nThe highlands afford considerable grazing. Great care is taken in\r\nimproving the stock, both of cattle and sheep. In the north the cattle\r\nare bred mainly as meat producers; in the south for dairy products.\r\nDurham, Alderney, and Jersey stock are exported to both Americas for\r\nbreeding purposes. The sheep of the highlands produce the heavy, coarse\r\nwool of which the well known "cheviot" and "frieze" textiles are made.\r\nElsewhere they are bred for mutton, of which the "South Down" variety is\r\nan example.\r\n\r\nThe lowland regions yield grain abundantly where cultivated. The average\r\nyield per acre is about double that of the United States, and is\r\nsurpassed by that of Denmark only. Both Ireland and England are famous\r\nfor fine dairy products. These are becoming the chief resource of the\r\nformer country, which is practically without the coal necessary for\r\nextensive manufacture. The fishing-grounds form an important food\r\nresource.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated lands do not supply the food needed for consumption. The\r\ngrain-crop lasts scarcely three months; the meat-crop but little longer.\r\nBread-stuffs from the United States and India, and meats from the United\r\nStates, Australia, and New Zealand make up the shortage. The annual\r\nimport of food-stuffs amounts to more than fifty dollars per capita.\r\n\r\nThe growing of wool and flax for cloth-making became an industry of\r\ngreat importance just after the accession of Henry VII. With the advent\r\nof peace, it became possible to manufacture into cloth the fibres that\r\nbefore had been sent for that purpose to Flanders. The utilization of\r\nthe coal and the iron ore years afterward brought about an economic\r\nrevolution that was intensified by the invention of the steam-engine and\r\nthe power-loom.\r\n\r\nThese quickly brought the country into the foremost rank as a\r\nmanufacturing centre. Moreover, they also demanded the foreign markets\r\nthat have made the country a maritime power as well--for an insular\r\ncountry must also have the ships with which to carry its merchandise to\r\nits markets.\r\n\r\nThe development of the manufactures, therefore, is inseparably connected\r\nwith that of the mineral and metal industries. From very early times the\r\nmetal deposits of the country have been a source of power. Copper and\r\ntin were used by the aboriginal Britons long before C\xc3\xa6sar\'s\r\nreconnaissance of the islands, and it is not unlikely that the Bronze\r\nPeriod was the natural development that resulted from the discovery of\r\nthese metals.\r\n\r\nCoal occurs in various fields that extend from the River Clyde to the\r\nRiver Severn. The annual output of these mines at the close of the\r\ncentury was about two hundred and twenty-five million tons. In the past\r\ncentury the inroads upon the visible supply were so great that the\r\noutput in the near future will be considerably lessened. Not far from\r\none-sixth of the output is sold to consumers in Russia and the\r\nMediterranean countries, but a growing sentiment to forbid any sale of\r\ncoal to foreign buyers is taking shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH ISLES]\r\n\r\nIron ores are fairly abundant, but the hematite required for the best\r\nBessemer steel is limited to the region about Manchester and Birmingham.\r\nThe shortage of this ore has become so apparent within recent years that\r\nGreat Britain has become a heavy purchaser of ores in foreign markets.\r\nThe coal in the Clyde basin is employed mainly in the manufacture of\r\nrailway iron, steamship material, and rolling stock. The manufacture of\r\nBessemer steel is gradually moving to the vicinity of South Wales, at\r\nthe ports of which foreign pig-iron can be most cheaply landed. In\r\nwest-central England the several coal-fields form a single centre of\r\nmanufacture, where are located some of the largest woollen and cotton\r\nmills in Europe. It also includes the plants for the manufacture of\r\nmachinery, cutlery, and pottery.\r\n\r\nThe import trade of Great Britain consists mainly of food-stuffs and raw\r\nmaterials.[67] Of the latter, cotton is by far the most important. Most\r\nof it comes from the United States, but the Nile delta, Brazil, the\r\nDekkan of India, the Iran plateau, and the Piura Valley of Peru send\r\nportions, each region having fibre of specific qualities designed for\r\nspecific uses. The native wool clip forms only a small part of the\r\namount used in manufacture. The remainder, more than three million\r\npounds, comes from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe supply of flax is small, and 100,000 tons are imported to meet the\r\nwants of the mills. The greater part is purchased in Russia, but the\r\nfiner quality is imported from Belgium. Jute is purchased from India and\r\nmanufactured into burlap and rugs.\r\n\r\nBut little available standing timber remains, and lumber must,\r\ntherefore, be imported. The pine is purchased mainly in Sweden, Norway,\r\nCanada, and the United States. A considerable amount of wood-pulp is\r\nimported from Canada for paper-making. Mahogany for ornamental\r\nmanufactures is obtained from Africa and British Honduras. Oak, and the\r\nwoods for interior finish, are purchased largely from Canada and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe export trade of Great Britain consists almost wholly of the articles\r\nmanufactured with British coal as the power. These are made from the raw\r\nmaterials purchased abroad, and the stamp of the British craftsman is a\r\nguarantee of excellence and honesty. Of the total export trade,\r\namounting yearly to about one billion, two hundred million dollars,\r\nnearly one-third consists of cotton, woollen, linen, and jute textiles;\r\none-fifth consists of iron and steel manufactured stuffs made from\r\nBritish ores. About one-third goes to the colonies of the\r\nmother-country, with whom she keeps in close touch; Germany, the United\r\nStates, and the South American states are the chief foreign buyers.\r\n\r\nFor the handling and carriage of these goods there is an admirable\r\nsystem of railways reaching from every part of the interior to the\r\nnumerous ports. The rolling stock and the locomotives are not nearly so\r\nheavy as those used in the United States; the railway beds and track\r\nequipment, on the whole, are probably the best in the world. Freight\r\nrates are considerably higher than on the corresponding classes of\r\nmerchandise in the United States. The public highways are most\r\nexcellent, but the means of street traffic in the cities are very poor.\r\n\r\nThe harbor facilities at the various ports are of the best. The docks\r\nand basins are usually arranged so that while the import goods are being\r\nlanded the export stuffs are made ready to be loaded. The facilities for\r\nthe rapid transfer of freights have been improved by the reconstruction\r\nof the various river estuaries so as to make them ship-channels. The\r\nestuaries of the Clyde, Tyne, and Mersey have been thus improved, while\r\nManchester has been made a seaport by an artificial canal. The British\r\nmerchant marine is the largest in the world, and about ninety per cent.\r\nof the vessels are steamships.\r\n\r\n_London_ is the capital; it is also one of the first commercial and\r\nfinancial centres of the world. The Thames has not a sufficient depth of\r\nwater for the largest liners, and these dock usually about twenty miles\r\nbelow the city. The colonial commerce at London is very heavy,\r\nespecially the India traffic, and it is mainly for this trade that the\r\nBritish acquired the control of the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\n_Liverpool_ is one of the most important ports of Europe, and receives\r\nmost of the American traffic. The White Star and Cunard Lines have their\r\nterminals at this port.\r\n\r\n_Southampton_ is also a port which receives a large share of American\r\ntraffic. The American and several foreign steamship lines discharge at\r\nthat place. _Hull_ and _Shields_ have a considerable part of the\r\nEuropean traffic. _Glasgow_ is one of the foremost centres of steel\r\nship-building. _Cardiff_ and _Swansea_ are ports connected with the coal\r\nand iron trade. _Queenstown_ is a calling point for transatlantic\r\nliners.\r\n\r\n_Manchester_ is both a cotton port and a great market for the cotton\r\ntextiles made in the nearby towns of the Lancashire coal-field. _Leeds_\r\nand _Bradford_ and the towns about them are the chief centres of woollen\r\nmanufacture. _Wilton_ and _Kidderminster_ are famous for carpets.\r\n_Birmingham_ is the centre of the steel manufactures. _Sheffield_ has a\r\nworld-wide reputation for cutlery. In and near the Staffordshire\r\ndistrict are the potteries that have made the names of _Worcester_,\r\n_Coalport_, _Doulton_, _Copeland_, and _Jackfield_ famous. _Belfast_ is\r\nnoted for its linen textiles, and also for some of the largest\r\nsteamships afloat that have been built in its yards. _Dundee_ is the\r\nchief centre of jute manufacture.\r\n\r\n=The German Empire.=--The German Empire consists of the kingdoms of\r\nPrussia, Bavaria, Saxony, and W\xc3\xbcrtemburg, together with a number of\r\nsmall states. The "free" cities of Hamburg, Bremen, and L\xc3\xbcbeck, whose\r\nindependence was purchased in feudal times, are also incorporated within\r\nthe empire. The present empire was formed in 1871, at the close of the\r\nwar between Germany and France. The merging of the states into the\r\nempire was designed as a political step, but it proved a great\r\nindustrial revolution as well.\r\n\r\nThe plain of Europe which slopes to the north and the Baltic Sea, the\r\nflood-plains of the rivers excepted, is feebly productive of grain. It\r\nis a fine grazing region, however, and the dairy products are of the\r\nbest quality. Among European states Russia alone surpasses Germany in\r\nthe number of cattle grown. The province of Schleswig-Holstein is famous\r\nthe world over for its fine cattle. Cavalry horses are a special feature\r\nof the lowland plain, and the government is the chief buyer. The wool\r\nproduct has hitherto been important, but the sheep ranges are being\r\nturned into crop lands, on account of the increase of population in the\r\nindustrial regions.\r\n\r\nThe midland belt, however, between the coast-plain and the mountains, is\r\nthe chief food-producing part of Germany. Rye and wheat are grown\r\nwherever possible, but the entire grain-crop is consumed in about eight\r\nmonths. The United States, Argentina, and Russia supply the wheat and\r\nflour; Russia supplies the rye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GERMANY AND SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES]\r\n\r\nThe sugar-beet is by far the most important export crop, and Germany\r\nproduces yearly about one million, eight hundred thousand tons, or\r\nnearly as much as Austria-Hungary and France combined. This industry is\r\nencouraged by a bounty paid on all sugar exported.[68] A considerable\r\namount of raw beet-sugar is sold to the refineries of the United States;\r\nGreat Britain also is a heavy buyer. The home consumption is relatively\r\nsmall, being about one-third per capita that of the United States.\r\nSilesia, the Rhine Valley, and the lowlands of the Hartz Mountains are\r\nthe most important centres of the sugar industry.\r\n\r\nGermany is rich in minerals.[69] Zinc occurs in abundance, and the mines\r\nof Silesia furnish the world\'s chief supply. Most of the lithographic\r\nstone in use is obtained in Bavaria. Copper and silver are mined in the\r\nErz and Hartz Mountains. During the sixteenth century the mines of the\r\nlatter region brought the states then forming Germany into commercial\r\nprominence and thereby diverted the trade between the North and\r\nMediterranean Seas to the valleys of the Rhine and Elbe Rivers.\r\n\r\nThese two metal products made Germany a great financial power. The\r\nFranco-Prussian War added to Germany the food-producing lands of the\r\nRhine and Moselle, and the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. At the same\r\ntime it gave the Germans organization by welding the various German\r\nstates into an empire. As a result there has been an industrial\r\ndevelopment that has placed Germany in the class with the United States\r\nand Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBy unifying the various interstate systems of commerce and\r\ntransportation, the iron and steel industry has greatly expanded. The\r\nchief centre of this industry is the valley of the Ruhr River.\r\nCoal-measures underlie an area somewhat larger than the basin of the\r\nriver. To the industrial centres of this valley iron ore is brought by\r\nthe Rhine and Moselle barges from Alsace-Lorraine and Luxemburg, and\r\nalso from the Hartz Mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the importance and extent of manufactures, Germany ranks next to\r\nGreat Britain among European states, and because of the extent of their\r\ncoal-fields the Germans seem destined in time to surpass their rivals.\r\nThe manufacture of textiles is one of the leading industries, and, next\r\nto Great Britain, Germany is the heaviest purchaser of raw cotton from\r\nthe United States. The Rhine district is the chief centre of cotton\r\ntextile manufacture. Raw cotton is delivered to the mills by the Rhine\r\nboats, and these carry the manufactured product to the seaboard. Central\r\nand South America are the chief purchasers.\r\n\r\nWoollen goods are also extensively manufactured, the industry being in\r\nthe region that produces Saxony wool. In Silesia and the lower Rhine\r\nprovinces there are also extensive woollen textile manufactures, but the\r\ngoods are made mainly from imported wool. Argentina and the other Plate\r\nRiver countries are the chief buyers of these goods. There is a\r\nconsiderable linen manufacture from German-grown flax, and silk-making,\r\nmainly from raw silk imported from Italy.\r\n\r\nThe great expansion and financial success of the manufacturing\r\nenterprises is due very largely to the admirable organization of the\r\nlines of transportation. The rivers, with their connecting canals,\r\nsupplement the railways instead of competing with them. They are\r\nutilized mainly for slow freights, while the railways carry the traffic\r\nthat demands speed. The possibilities of both inland water-ways and\r\nrailway transportation have been utilized by the Germans to the utmost,\r\nwith the result of a very low rate both for coal and ore, and for\r\nstructural iron and steel. The latter is carried from the various\r\nsteel-making plants in the Ruhr Valley to the seaboard at a rate of\r\neighty to ninety cents per ton.[70]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L\xc3\x9cBECK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREMEN]\r\n\r\nAll this has resulted in a wonderful commercial expansion of the\r\nempire. In 1875 Germany was neither a maritime nor a naval power. At the\r\nclose of the century it ranked about with the United States as a naval\r\npower, and far surpassed that country in the tonnage of merchant marine.\r\nThe German steamship fleet includes the largest and fastest vessels\r\nafloat.\r\n\r\nGerman trade may be summed up as an export of manufactured goods and an\r\nimport of food-stuffs and raw materials. At the close of the century the\r\nannual movement of industrial products amounted to nearly two and\r\none-half billion dollars. About one-half the trade of the empire is\r\ncarried on with Great Britain, the United States, Austria-Hungary, and\r\nRussia. A large part of the foreign trade is carried on through the\r\nports of Belgium and Holland.\r\n\r\n_Berlin_, the capital, is one of the few cities having a population of\r\nmore than one million. It is not only a great centre of trade, but it is\r\none of the leading money-markets of Europe; it is also the chief railway\r\ncentre. _Hamburg_ and _Bremen_ are important ports of German-American\r\ntrade, the former being the largest seaport of continental Europe.\r\n_Breslau_ is an important market, into which the raw materials of\r\neastern Europe are received, and from which they are sent to the\r\nmanufacturing districts. The art galleries of _Dresden_ have had the\r\neffect of making that city a centre of art manufactures which are famous\r\nthe world over. _L\xc3\xbcbeck_ is one of the free cities that was formerly in\r\nthe Hanse League.\r\n\r\nThe twin cities, _Barmen-Eberfeld_, in the Ruhr coal-field, form one of\r\nthe principal centres of cotton manufacture in the world. _Dortmund_ is\r\na coal-market. At _Essen_ are the steel-works founded by Herr Krupp.\r\nThey are the largest and one of the most complete plants in the world.\r\nThe output includes arms, heavy and light ordnance, and about every kind\r\nof structural iron and steel used. About forty thousand men are\r\nemployed. _Chemnitz_ is an important point, not only of cotton\r\nmanufacture, but also of Saxony wools, underwear and shawls being its\r\nmost noteworthy products. At _Stettin_, _Danzig_, and _Kiel_ are built\r\nthe steamships that have given to Germany its great commercial power.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nIn what ways are Great Britain and Germany commercial rivals?\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages of each with respect to position?--with respect\r\nto natural resources?\r\n\r\nFrom the Statesman\'s Year-Book make a list of the leading exports of\r\neach;--the leading imports of each. What exports have they in common?\r\n\r\nFrom the Abstract of Statistics find what commodities the United States\r\nsells to each.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nAdams\'s New Empire--Chapter III.\r\n\r\nGibbins\'s History of Commerce--Book III, Chapters III-V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nEUROPE--THE BALTIC AND NORTH SEA STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThese states, like Great Britain and Germany, belong to Germanic Europe,\r\nand their situation around the North and Baltic Seas makes their\r\ncommercial interests much the same. From the stand-point of commerce\r\nHolland might be regarded as an integral part of Germany, inasmuch as a\r\nlarge part of the foreign commerce of Germany must reach the sea by\r\ncrossing that state.\r\n\r\n=Sweden and Norway.=--Sweden and Norway occupy the region best known as\r\nthe Scandinavian peninsula. The western side faces the warm, moist winds\r\nof the Atlantic, but the surface is too rugged to be productive. The\r\nlands suitable for farming, on the other hand, are on the east side,\r\nwhere, owing to the high latitude, the winters are extremely cold.\r\n\r\nThe plateau lands are in the latitude of the great pine-forest belt that\r\nextends across the two continents. The forests of the Scandinavian\r\npeninsula are near the most densely peopled part of Europe, and they are\r\nalso readily accessible. Moreover, the rugged surface offers unlimited\r\nwater-power. As a result Norway and Sweden practically control the\r\nlumber-market of Europe, and their lumber products form one of the most\r\nimportant exports of the kingdom. Norway pine competes with California\r\nredwood in Australia. The "naval stores," tar and pitch, compete with\r\nthose of Georgia and the Carolinas. The wood-pulp from this region is\r\nthe chief supply of the paper-makers of Europe. Next to Russia, Sweden\r\nhas the largest lumber-trade in Europe. The Mediterranean states are the\r\nchief buyers.\r\n\r\nThe mineral products are a considerable source of income. Building stone\r\nis shipped to the nearby lowland countries. The famous Swedish\r\nmanganese-iron ores, essential in steel manufacture, are shipped to the\r\nUnited States and Europe. For this purpose they compete with the ores of\r\nSpain and Cuba. The mines of the Gellivare iron district are probably\r\nthe only iron-mines of consequence within the frigid zone. The ore is\r\nsent to German and British smelteries.\r\n\r\nThe fisheries are the most important of Europe, and this fact has had a\r\ngreat influence on the history of the people. Centuries ago the people\r\nliving about the _vigs_ or fjords of the west coast were compelled to\r\ndepend almost wholly on the fisheries for their food-supplies. As a\r\nresult they became the most famous sailors of the world. They\r\nestablished settlements in Iceland and Greenland; they also planted a\r\ncolony in North America 500 years before the voyage of Columbus.\r\nHerring, salmon, and cod are the principal catch of the fisheries, and\r\nabout four-fifths of the product is cured and exported to the Catholic\r\nEuropean states and to South America.\r\n\r\nSouth of Kristiania farming is the principal industry. Much of the land\r\nis suitable for wheat-growing, but the productive area is so small that\r\na considerable amount of bread-stuffs must be imported from the United\r\nStates. On account of the high latitude the winters are too long and\r\nsevere for any but the hardiest grains. Dairy products are commercially\r\nthe most important output of the farms, and they find a ready market in\r\nthe popular centres of Europe--London, Hamburg, Paris, and Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe lumber, furniture, matches, fish, ores, and dairy products sold\r\nabroad do not pay for the bread-stuffs, coal, petroleum, clothing, and\r\nmachinery. In part, this is made up by the carrying trade of Norwegian\r\nvessels; the rest of the deficit is more than met by the money which the\r\nthrongs of tourists spend during the summer months.\r\n\r\nThe United States buys from these countries fish and ores to the amount\r\nof about three million dollars a year; it sells them cotton, petroleum,\r\nbread-stuffs, and machinery to the amount of about twelve million\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n_Stockholm_, the capital of Sweden, is the chief financial and\r\ndistributing centre of the Scandinavian trade. Its railway system\r\nreaches about every area of production. Although having a good harbor of\r\nits own, it must depend on _Trondhjem_ (Drontheim) for winter traffic,\r\nbecause the Baltic ports are closed by ice three or four months of the\r\nyear. _Kristiania_, the capital of Norway, is the export market of the\r\nfish and lumber products.\r\n\r\n_G\xc3\xb6teborg_, owing to recently completed railway and canal connections,\r\nis becoming an important port of trade. It is convenient to other\r\nEuropean ports, and it is rarely closed by ice. _Bergen_, _Trondhjem_,\r\nand _Hammerfest_ derive a heavy income from their fisheries and likewise\r\nfrom the tourists who visit the coast during midsummer. The last-named\r\nport, although farther north than any town in the world, has an open\r\nharbor during the winter.\r\n\r\n=Denmark.=--Denmark is essentially an agricultural state, and almost every\r\nsquare mile of available land is under cultivation. Even the sand-dunes\r\nhave been reclaimed and converted into pasturage. The yield of wheat is\r\ngreater per acre than in any other country, but as only a small area is\r\nsown, wheat and flour are imported.\r\n\r\nAbout half the area of the state is used in growing fodder for horses\r\nand cattle. The dairy products, especially butter, are unrivalled\r\nelsewhere in Europe. The dairy business is largely controlled by a\r\ncooperative association of dairymen and farmers. Pastures, fodder,\r\ncattle, sheds, creameries, and all the processes involved are subject to\r\na most rigid sanitary inspection.\r\n\r\n_Copenhagen_, the capital, is the financial centre of the kingdom.\r\nCommercially it is one of the most important ports of Europe. Various\r\nshipments consigned to Baltic ports are landed at this city; here the\r\ncargoes break bulk and are again trans-shipped to their destination. In\r\norder to facilitate this forwarding business, the Crown has made\r\nCopenhagen a free port. Steamship lines connect it with New York,\r\nBritish ports, and the East Indies.\r\n\r\nA great deal of farming and dairy machinery is manufactured; coal,\r\ncotton goods, and structural machinery are imported from the United\r\nStates. Little, however, is exported to that country, almost all the\r\ndairy products being sold to Great Britain and other populous centres of\r\nwestern Europe. _Aalborg_ and _Aarhuus_ are dairy-markets.\r\n\r\nGreenland and Iceland are colonies of Denmark, and the fishing industry\r\nof the kingdom is carried on mainly along the shores of these islands.\r\nThe furs, seal-skins, seal-oil, and eider-down of Greenland are a\r\ngovernment monopoly. The mineral cryolite occurs at Ivigtut and is mined\r\nby soda-making establishments in the United States. Iceland produces\r\nsheep, cattle, and fish; these are shipped from _Reikiavik_. The Faroe\r\nIslands produce but little save wool, feathers, and birds\' eggs.\r\n\r\n=Belgium.=--Probably in no other country of Europe has nature done so\r\nlittle and man so much to make a great state as in Belgium. The lowland\r\nregion has been made so fertile by artificial means that it yields more\r\nwheat per acre than any other country except Denmark. The Ardennes\r\nhighland in the southeast is naturally unproductive, but it has become\r\none of the great manufacturing centres of Europe. Less than one-twelfth\r\nof the area of the state is unproductive.\r\n\r\nThe coast, more than twoscore miles in extent, has not a single harbor\r\nfor large vessels, and the two navigable rivers, the Scheldt and Meuse,\r\nflow into another state before reaching the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLLAND AND BELGIUM]\r\n\r\nThe low sand-barrens next the coast have been reclaimed by means of a\r\ngrass that holds in place the sand that formerly shifted with each\r\nmovement of the wind. This region is now cultivated pasture-land that\r\nproduces the finest of horses, cattle, and dairy products. The dairy\r\nproducts go mainly to London. The Flemish horses, like those of the\r\nsand-barrens of Germany and France, are purchased in the large cities,\r\nwhere heavy draught-horses are required. Many of them are sold to the\r\nexpress companies of the United States.\r\n\r\nBordering the sand-barrens is a belt of land that produces grain and the\r\nsugar-beet. Flax is an important product, and its cultivation has had\r\nmuch to do with both the history and the political organization of the\r\nstate. Before the advent of the cotton industry, woollen and linen were\r\npractically the only fibres used in cloth-making. Belgium was then the\r\nchief flax-growing and cloth-making country, and all western Europe\r\ndepended upon the Flemish looms for cloth. This industry, therefore,\r\ngave the country not only commercial prominence, but was largely\r\nresponsible for its political independence as well. Flax is still an\r\nimportant product, and the linen textiles made in the state are without\r\na superior. Much of the flax is grown in the valley of the River Lys.\r\n\r\nOne of the most productive coal-fields of Europe stretches across\r\nBelgium, and a few miles south of it are the iron-ore deposits that\r\nextend also into Luxemburg and Germany. In addition to these, the\r\nzinc-mines about Moresnet are among the richest in the world. Belgium\r\nis, therefore, one of the great metal-working centres of Europe. A small\r\nportion of the coal is exported to France, but most of it is required in\r\nthe manufactures.\r\n\r\n_Li\xc3\xa8ge_, _Seraing_, and _Verviers_ are the great centres of the metal\r\nindustry. They were built at the eastern extremity of the coal-field,\r\nwithin easy reach of the iron ores. Firearms, railroad steel, and\r\ntool-making machinery are the chief products of the region, and because\r\nof the favorable situation, these products easily compete with the\r\nmanufactures of Germany and France.\r\n\r\n_Ghent_ is the chief focal point for the flax product, which is\r\nconverted into the finest of linen cloth and art fabrics. Much of the\r\nweaving and spinning machinery employed in Europe is made in this city.\r\n_Mechlin_ and the villages near by are famous the world over for\r\nhand-worked laces.\r\n\r\nExpensive porcelains, art tiles, glassware, and cheap crockery are made\r\nin the line of kilns that reaches almost from one end of the coal-field\r\nto the other; these products, moreover, are extensively exported.\r\n\r\nThe railways are owned and operated by the state. They are managed so\r\njudiciously, moreover, that the rates of carriage are lower than in most\r\nEuropean states. The Scheldt is navigable for large ocean steamers to\r\n_Antwerp_, and this city is the great Belgian port for ocean traffic.\r\nThe city owes its importance to its position. One branch of the Scheldt\r\nleads toward the Rhine; the other is connected by a canal with the\r\nrivers of France; the main stem of the river points toward London. It is\r\ntherefore the meeting of three ways. It is the terminal of the\r\nsteamships of American, and of various other lines. It is also the depot\r\nof the Kongo trade. Ship-canals deep enough for coasters and freighters\r\nconnect _Ghent_, _Bruges_, and _Brussels_ with tide-water. These are\r\nabout to be converted to deep-water ship-canals.\r\n\r\nThe foreign commerce of Belgium is much like that of other European\r\nstates. Wheat, meat, maize, cotton, and petroleum are imported mainly\r\nfrom the United States; iron ore is purchased from Luxemburg and\r\nGermany, and various raw materials are brought from France. In exchange\r\nthere are exported fine machinery, linen fabrics, porcelains, fire-arms,\r\nglassware, and beet-sugar. From the Kongo state, at the head of which is\r\nthe King of the Belgians, are obtained rubber and ivory. The rubber is\r\nsold mainly to the United States.\r\n\r\n_Brussels_ is the capital and financial centre. On account of the state\r\ncontrol of the railways, it is also the directive centre of all the\r\nindustries pertaining to commerce and transportation.\r\n\r\n=Holland.=--The names Holland and Netherlands mean "lowland," and the\r\nstate itself has a lower surface than any other country of Europe.\r\nNearly half the area is at high-tide level or else below it. A large\r\npart, mainly the region about the Zuider[71] Sea, has been reclaimed\r\nfrom the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the reclamation of these lands stone dikes are built to enclose a\r\ngiven area, and from the basin thus constructed the water is pumped. The\r\nreclaimed lands, or "polders," include not only the sea-bottom, but the\r\ncoast marshes as well; even the rivers are bordered with levees in order\r\nto prevent overflows. Windmills are the machinery by which the water is\r\npumped from the polders into the sea. In no other part of the world is\r\nwind-power so extensively used. Almost every acre of the polders is\r\nunder cultivation, and these lands grow a very large part of the\r\nvegetables and flowers consumed in the great cities of England, France,\r\nand Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe coast sand-barrens have been converted into pasture-lands that\r\nproduce draught-horses, beef cattle, and dairy cattle. The horses find a\r\nready market in the United States and the large European cities; the\r\ndairy cattle not needed at home are exported, the United States being a\r\nheavy purchaser. The beef cattle are grown mainly for the markets of\r\nLondon. Dutch butter is used far beyond the boundaries of the state, and\r\nEdam cheese reaches nearly every large city of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-beet is extensively cultivated, in spite of the great trade\r\nresulting from the cane-sugar industry of the East Indies. It is more\r\nprofitable to import wheat from the United States and rye from Russia in\r\norder to use the land for the sugar-beet.\r\n\r\nPractically no timber suitable for lumber manufacture exists, and\r\nbuilding material therefore must be imported. Pine is purchased from\r\nRussia, Scandinavia, and the United States. Stone is purchased wherever\r\nit may be obtained as return freight, or as ballast. The coast fisheries\r\nyield oysters, herrings, and "anchovies," which are not anchovies, but\r\nsprats.\r\n\r\nFor want of coal and iron there are few manufactures, and the garden and\r\ndairy products are about the only export articles. There is an\r\nabundance of clay, and of this brick for road-making, tiles for building\r\npurposes, and porcelains are made. But little of the raw sugar is\r\nrefined; most of it is sold to foreign refiners, and the United States\r\nis one of the chief customers.\r\n\r\nHolland is a great commercial country, and for more than five hundred\r\nyears the Dutch flag has been found in almost every large port of the\r\nworld. Much of the commerce is derived from the tobacco, sugar, and\r\ncoffee plantations of the Dutch East Indies.\r\n\r\nA very large part of the commerce, however, is neither import or export\r\ntrade, but a "transit" commerce. Thus, American coal-oil is transferred\r\nfrom the great ocean tank-steamers to smaller tank-boats, and is then\r\ncarried across the state into Germany, France, and Belgium, through the\r\nnumerous canals.\r\n\r\nThis trade applies also to many of the products of the German industries\r\nwhich will not bear a heavy freight tariff, such as coal, ores, etc. It\r\nreaches the Rhine and Rhone river-basins and extends even to the Danube.\r\nBoth Switzerland and Austria-Hungary send much of their exports through\r\nHolland. All trade at the various ports and through the canals is free,\r\nit being the policy to encourage and not to obstruct commerce.\r\n\r\n_Amsterdam_, the constitutional capital, is one of the great financial\r\nand banking centres of Europe. The completion of the Nord Holland canal\r\nmakes the docks and basins accessible to the largest steamships.\r\nDiamond-cutting is one of the unique industries of the city. Since the\r\ndiscovery of the African mines its former trade in diamonds has been\r\nlargely absorbed by London.\r\n\r\nMore than half the carrying trade of the state centres at _Rotterdam_.\r\nBy the improvement of the river estuaries and canals this city has\r\nbecome one of the best ports of Europe, and the tonnage of goods\r\nhandled at the docks is enormously increasing. _Vlissingen_ (Flushing)\r\nand the _Hook_ are railway terminals that handle much of the local\r\nfreights consigned to London. _Delft_ is famous the world over for the\r\nbeautiful porcelain made at its potteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nHow has the topography of each of these states affected its commerce?\r\n\r\nHow is their commerce affected by latitude and climate?\r\n\r\nHow has the cultivation of the sugar-beet affected the cane-sugar\r\nindustry in the British West Indies?\r\n\r\nFrom the Statesman\'s Year-Book make a list of the leading exports and\r\nimports of each country.\r\n\r\nFrom the Abstract of Statistics find the trade of the United States with\r\neach of these countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nAdams\'s New Empire--pp. 153-159.\r\n\r\nGibbins\'s History of Commerce--Book III, Chapters I and VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nEUROPE--THE MEDITERRANEAN STATES AND SWITZERLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean states are peopled mainly by races whose social and\r\neconomic development was moulded largely by the Roman occupation of the\r\nMediterranean basin for a period of more than one thousand years. The\r\noccupations of the people have been shaped to a great extent by the\r\nslope of the land and by the mountain-ranges that long isolated them\r\nfrom the Germanic peoples north of the Alps.\r\n\r\n=France.=--The position of France with respect to industrial development\r\nis fortunate. The North Sea coast faces the ports of Great Britain; the\r\nAtlantic ports are easily accessible to American centres of commerce;\r\nthe Mediterranean ports command a very large part of the trade of that\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe easily travelled overland routes between the Mediterranean and North\r\nSeas in very early times gave the country a commercial prominence that\r\never since has been retained. Even before the time of C\xc3\xa6sar it was a\r\nfamous trading-ground for Mediterranean merchants, and the conquest of\r\nthe country was not so much for the spoils of war as for the extension\r\nof Roman commercial influence.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of France is an agricultural region, and nowhere is the\r\nsoil cultivated with greater skill. Although the state is not quite as\r\nlarge as Texas, there are more farms than in all the United States,\r\ntheir small size making thorough cultivation a necessity. Much of the\r\nland is too valuable for wheat-farming, and so the eastern\r\nmanufacturing districts depend upon the Russian wheat-farms for their\r\nsupply. Northwestern France, however, has a surplus of wheat, and this\r\nis sold to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCE]\r\n\r\nThe sugar-beet is the most profitable crop, and its cultivation is aided\r\nindirectly by the government, which gives a bounty on all exported\r\nsugar. The area of sugar-beet cultivation will probably increase to its\r\nlimit for this reason.\r\n\r\nThe French farmer is an artist in the cultivation of small fruits, and\r\nthe latter form an important source of revenue. Of the fruit-crop, the\r\ngrape is by far the most important commercially. French wines,\r\nespecially the champagnes, are exported to a greater extent than the\r\nwines of any other country.[72] Most of the wine is sold in Great\r\nBritain and the countries north of the grape belt; a considerable part\r\nis sold in the United States and the eastern countries. Champagne,\r\nBordeaux, the Loire, and the Rhone Valleys are famous wine districts.\r\nWine is also imported, to be refined or to be made into brandy.\r\n\r\nCattle-breeding, both for meat and for dairy purposes, is extensively\r\ncarried on. The meat is consumed at home. Butter is an important export,\r\nespecially in the northwest, where a large amount is made for London\r\nconsumers. This region produces Camembert and Neufchatel cheese, both of\r\nwhich are largely exported; Brie cheese is made chiefly along the German\r\nborder. The Roquefort product, made of ewe\'s milk, is fermented in\r\nlimestone caves and cellars. All these varieties have a large sale, the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain being heavy purchasers.\r\n\r\nThe Percheron draught-horse is raised for export as well as for home\r\nuse; mules are extensively raised for the army wagon-trains of Great\r\nBritain and Germany. Sheep are grown for the finer grades of wool, but\r\nso much of the sheep pasture has been given to the cultivation of the\r\nsugar-beet, that a considerable part of the woollen textiles are now\r\nmade of wool imported from Argentina. A large part of the eggs and table\r\npoultry consumed in London are products of northwestern France.\r\n\r\nThe coal-fields of the north produce nearly two-thirds of the total\r\namount consumed. Iron ores are found near the German border; they are\r\nsent to coal-fields in the neighborhood of St. \xc3\x89tienne and Le Creuz\xc3\xb4t to\r\nbe manufactured into steel. Both coal and iron ore are deficient. To\r\nmeet the requirements of consumption, the former is imported from Great\r\nBritain, Germany, and Belgium; the latter, mainly from Germany and\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nThe manufactures of France have a wide influence. From the coal and iron\r\nare derived the intricate machinery that has made the country famous,\r\nthe railways, the powerful navy, and the merchant marine that has made\r\nthe country a great commercial nation. Because of the great creative\r\nskill and taste of the people, French textiles are standards of good\r\ntaste, and they find a ready market in all parts of the world. In\r\ntextile manufactures more than one million people and upward of one\r\nhundred thousand looms are employed.\r\n\r\nThe United States is a heavy buyer of the woollen cloths and the finer\r\nqualities of dress goods. Inasmuch as these goods have not been\r\nsuccessfully imitated elsewhere, the French trade does not suffer from\r\ncompetition. The best goods are made from the fleeces of French merino\r\nsheep, and are manufactured mainly in the northern towns. The Gobelin\r\ntapestries of Paris are famous the world over.\r\n\r\nThe cotton manufactures depend mainly on American cotton. About\r\ntwo-thirds of the cotton is purchased in the United States, a part of\r\nwhich returns in the form of fine goods that may be classed as muslins,\r\ntulles, and art textiles. The market for such goods is also general. In\r\nthe manufacture of fine laces, such as the Point d\'Alen\xc3\xa7on fabrics, the\r\nFrench have few equals and no superiors. The flax is imported mainly\r\nfrom Belgium.\r\n\r\nSilk culture is aided by the government, and is carried on mainly in\r\nthe south. The amount grown, however, is insufficient to keep the\r\nfactories busy, and more than four-fifths of the raw silk and cocoons\r\nare imported from Italy and other southern countries.\r\n\r\nThe chief imports to France are coal, raw textile fibres, wine, wheat,\r\nand lumber. The last two products excepted, they are again exported in\r\nthe form of manufactured products. The great bulk of the imports comes\r\nfrom Great Britain, the United States, Germany, Belgium, Russia, and\r\nArgentina. In 1900 the import trade from these countries aggregated\r\nabout five hundred million dollars. The total export trade during the\r\nsame year was about eight hundred million dollars; it consisted mainly\r\nof high-priced articles of luxury.\r\n\r\nThe foreign trade is supported by a navy, which ranks second among the\r\nworld\'s navies, and a merchant marine of more than fifteen thousand\r\nvessels. Aside from the subsidies given to mail steamships, government\r\nencouragement is given for the construction and equipment of home-built\r\nvessels. It is a settled policy that French vessels shall carry French\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nOf the 24,000 miles of railway, about 2,000 miles are owned by the\r\nstate. The rivers are connected by canals, and these furnish about 7,000\r\nmiles of navigable waters. As in Germany, the water-routes supplement\r\nthe railway lines. Practically all lines of transportation converge at\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n_Paris_, the capital, is a great centre of finance, art, science, and\r\nliterature, whose influence in these features has been felt all over the\r\nworld. The character of fine textiles, and also the fashions in the\r\nUnited States and Europe, are regulated largely in this city.\r\n_Marseille_ is the chief seaport, and practically all the trade between\r\nFrance and the Mediterranean countries is landed at this port; it is\r\nalso the focal point of the trade between France and her African\r\ncolonies, and a landing-place for the cotton brought from Egypt and\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\n_Havre_, the port receiving most of the trade from the United States, is\r\nthe port of Paris. _Rouen_ is the chief seat of cotton manufacture.\r\n_Paris_ and _Rheims_ are noted for shawls. _Lille_ and _Roubaix_ are\r\ncentres of woollen manufacture. _Lyons_ is the great seat of silk\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\n=Italy.=--Italy is a spur of the Alps extending into the Mediterranean\r\nSea. From its earliest history it has been an agricultural state, and,\r\nexcepting the periods when it has been rent by wars, it has been one of\r\nthe most productive countries in the world.\r\n\r\nWheat is extensively grown, but the crop is insufficient for home\r\nconsumption, and the deficit is imported from Russia and Hungary. A\r\nlarge part of the wheat-crop is grown in the valley of the Po River.\r\nFlax and hemp are grown for export in this region; and corn for home\r\nconsumption is a general product. Cotton is a good crop in Sicily and\r\nthe south, but the amount is insufficient for use and must be made up by\r\nimports from the United States and Egypt.\r\n\r\nSilk, fruit, and vegetables are the staple products that connect Italy\r\ncommercially with the rest of the world. About a million people are\r\nconcerned in the silk industry, and Italy is one of the foremost\r\ncountries in the world in the production of raw silk. Most of the crop\r\nis produced in northern Italy; western Europe and the United States are\r\nthe chief buyers. The silk of the Piedmont region is the best in\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nFruit is the crop next in value to raw silk. Sicilian oranges and\r\nlemons, from about twenty millions of trees, find a ready market in\r\nEurope; the oranges come into competition with the California and\r\nFlorida oranges of the United States, in spite of the tariff imposed\r\nagainst them by the latter country. Olives are probably the most\r\nimportant fruit-crop. Both the preserved fruit and the oil are exported\r\nto nearly every civilized people. Much of the oil is consumed at home,\r\nvery largely taking the place of meat and butter. Lucca-oil is regarded\r\nas the best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ITALY]\r\n\r\nThe grape-crop is enormous, and the fruit itself is exported. Some of\r\nthe fruit sold as "Malaga" grapes throughout the United States during\r\nwinter months comes from Italy. Chianti wine, from the vineyards around\r\nFlorence, has hitherto been regarded as an inferior product, but the\r\nforeign demand for it is steadily increasing. The Marsala wines of\r\nSicily are largely exported.\r\n\r\nAmong mineral products the iron deposits in the island of Elba are\r\nundoubtedly the most valuable, but they are yet undeveloped to any great\r\nextent. The quarries at Carrara produce a fine marble that has made\r\nItaly famous in sculpture and architecture. Much of the boracic acid\r\nused in the arts comes from Tuscany, and the world\'s chief supply of\r\nsulphur comes from the neighborhood of Mount Etna in Sicily. Of this\r\nAmericans buy about one-third.\r\n\r\nOn account of the lack of coal, the manufactures are restricted mainly\r\nto art wares, such as jewelry, silk textiles, and fine glassware. The\r\nVenetian glassware, the Florentine and mosaic jewelry, and the pink\r\ncoral ornaments are famous the world over. Within recent years, however,\r\nimported coal, together with native lignite, have given steel\r\nmanufacture an impetus. Steel ships and rails made at home are meeting\r\nthe demands of commerce. Goods of American cotton are made for export to\r\nTurkey and South American countries.\r\n\r\nRaw silk, wine, olive-oil, straw goods, sulphur, and art goods are\r\nexported. Cotton, wheat, tobacco, and farm machinery from the United\r\nStates, and coal, woollen textiles, and steel goods from Great Britain\r\nare the chief imports. Most of the foreign trade is with the nearby\r\nstates. The raw silk goes to France.\r\n\r\nSince the unification of Italy the railways have been readjusted to the\r\nneeds of commerce. Before that time the lines were wholly local in\r\ncharacter; with the readjustment they were organized into trunk lines.\r\nThey enter France through the Mont Cenis tunnel; they reach Switzerland\r\nand Germany by way of St. Gotthard Pass; they cross the Austrian border\r\nthrough Brenner Pass.\r\n\r\n_Rome_, the capital, is a political rather than an industrial centre.\r\n_Milan_, the Chicago of the kingdom, is the chief market for the crops\r\nof northern Italy and a great railway centre. It is also the market for\r\nraw silk. _Genoa_, the principal port, is the one at which most of the\r\ntrade of the United States is landed. _Naples_ monopolizes most of the\r\nmarine traffic between Italy and Great Britain. _Leghorn_ is famous for\r\nits manufacture and trade in straw goods. A considerable part of the\r\ngrain harvested in the Po Valley is stored for shipment at _Venice_--not\r\nin elevators, but in pits. _Palermo_ is the trading centre of Sicily.\r\nMost of the sulphur is shipped from _Catania_. _Brindisi_ and _Ancona_\r\nare shipping-points for the Suez Canal route.\r\n\r\n=Spain and Portugal.=--The surface of these states is too rugged and the\r\nclimate too arid for any great agricultural development. Less than half\r\nthe area is under cultivation; nevertheless, they are famous for several\r\nagricultural products--merino wool, wine, and fruit. The merino wool of\r\nthe Iberian peninsula has no equal for fine dress goods; it is imported\r\ninto almost every other country having woollen manufactures. A\r\nconsiderable amount of ordinary wool is grown, but not enough for home\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nThe fruit industry is an important source of income. Oranges, limes, and\r\nlemons are extensively grown for exports; among these products is the\r\nbitter orange, from which the famous liqueur cura\xc3\xa7ao, a Dutch\r\nmanufacture, is made. The heavy, sweet port wine, now famous the world\r\nover, was first made prominent in the vineyards of Spain and Portugal.\r\nMalaga raisins are sold in nearly every part of England and America. The\r\nolive is more extensively cultivated than in any other state, but both\r\nthe fruit and the oil are mainly consumed at home--the latter taking the\r\nplace of butter. Raw silk is grown for export to France.\r\n\r\nAlthough a larger part of the peninsula must depend on the American and\r\nScandinavian forests for lumber, there is one tree product that is in\r\ndemand wherever bottles are used--namely, cork. The cork is prepared\r\nfrom the bark of a tree (_Quercus suber_) commonly known as the cork\r\noak,[73] which grows freely in the Iberian peninsula and northern\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPAIN AND PORTUGAL]\r\n\r\nMetals and minerals of economic use are abundant. Iron ore is sold to\r\nGreat Britain, France, and Germany. Since the Spanish-American War,\r\nhowever, there have been extensive developments in utilizing the coal\r\nand the ore which before that time had been sold to other countries.\r\n\r\nThe undeveloped coal and iron resources are very great, and must figure\r\nin the payment of a national debt that is near the limit of bankruptcy.\r\nThe state, however, is entering a period of industrial prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe most available metal resource is quicksilver. Of this metal the\r\nmines in Almaden produce about one-half the world\'s supply. The working\r\nof these mines is practically a government monopoly, and the income was\r\nmortgaged for many years ahead when Spain was at war with her rebellious\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nBoth Spain and Portugal are poorly equipped with means for\r\ntransportation. The railways lack organization, and freight rates are\r\nexcessive. Not a little of the transportation still depends on the\r\nox-cart and the pack-train. The merchant marine has scarcely more than a\r\nname; the foreign commerce is carried almost wholly in British or French\r\nbottoms. The imports are mainly cotton, coal, lumber, and\r\nfood-stuffs--these in spite of the fact that every one save lumber might\r\nbe produced at home.\r\n\r\nWine and fruit products, iron ore, and quicksilver are leading exports.\r\nOf these the United States purchases wine and raisins for home\r\nconsumption and lace and filigree work for the trade with Mexico. Spain\r\nhas a considerable trade in cotton goods with her colonies, the Canary\r\nIslands, and the African provinces of Rio de Oro and Adrar.\r\n\r\nPortugal likewise supplies her foreign possessions--Goa (India), Macao\r\n(China), and the Cape Verde and Azores Islands--with home products. The\r\nchief Portuguese trade, however, is with Great Britain and Brazil.\r\n\r\n_Madrid_ is the capital of Spain. _Barcelona_ is the chief commercial\r\ncentre. _Valencia_, _Alicante_, _Cartagena_, and _Malaga_, are all ports\r\nof fruit and wine trade. _Oporto_ has been made famous for the port wine\r\nthat bears its name. Probably not one per cent. of the port now used,\r\nhowever, comes from Oporto, and not many Malaga raisins come from\r\nMalaga.\r\n\r\n=Switzerland.=--This state is situated in the heart of the highest Alps.\r\nThe southeastern half is above the altitude in which food-stuffs can be\r\nproduced, and probably no other inhabited country has a greater\r\nproportion of its area above the limits of perpetual snow. A\r\nconsiderable area of the mountain-slopes affords grazing. The\r\nvalley-lands of the lake-region produce a limited amount of food-stuffs,\r\nbut not enough for the sparse population.\r\n\r\nPolitically, Switzerland is a republic, having the position of a\r\n"buffer" state between Germany, Italy, France, and Austria-Hungary.\r\nRacially, the state is divided among Italians, French, and Germans; as a\r\nmatter of fact, however, the old Helvetian spirit, which not even C\xc3\xa6sar\r\ncould destroy, is still a great factor in dominating the people; this,\r\nwith their montane environment, gives the Swiss a very positive\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural interests of the state are developed to their utmost;\r\ntwo-thirds of the bread-stuffs, however, are purchased from the United\r\nStates, the plains of Bohemia, and Russia. Cherries, apples, grapes, and\r\nother fruit are cultivated in every possible place, and as these can be\r\ndelivered to any part of western and central Europe within a day, the\r\nfruit industry is a profitable one.\r\n\r\nCattle are bred for dairy purposes, but those for beef must be very\r\nlargely imported, Austria-Hungary and Italy selling the needed supply.\r\nGoats are raised for their hides, and the latter are converted into\r\nMorocco leather. Of the dairy products, cheese is in many respects the\r\nmost important; Gruy\xc3\xa8re cheese is exported to nearly every country. On\r\naccount of the long distance from populous centres milk cannot be\r\ntransported; much of it is, therefore, condensed, and in that form\r\nexported.\r\n\r\nA peculiar feature of the dairy industry is the fact that it is\r\nconstantly moving. The dairy herds begin to pasture in the lowlands as\r\nsoon as the snow melts, and as fast as the snow line recedes up the\r\nmountains the cattle follow. The milk is converted into butter and\r\ncheese wherever the herds may be, and the second crop of grass below\r\nthem is cut and cured for winter forage.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that Switzerland has no available coal,[74]\r\nmanufacture is pre-eminently the industry of the state. During the long\r\nwinters the Alpine herdsman and his family whittle out wooden toys from\r\nthe stock of rough lumber laid by for the purpose. Farther down in the\r\nvalley-lands the exquisite brocades and muslins are made on hand-looms,\r\nor by the aid of the abundant water-power. Each industrial district has\r\nits special line of manufacture, so that there is scarcely an idle day\r\nin the year.\r\n\r\nIn the cities and towns of the lowland district, watches, clocks,\r\nmusic-boxes, and fine machinery are manufactured. For many years Swiss\r\nwatches were about the only ones used in the United States, but on\r\naccount of the competition of American watches this trade has fallen\r\noff. The mechanical music-player, operated by perforated paper, has also\r\ninterfered with the trade in music-boxes.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland is provided with excellent facilities for transportation,\r\nand this has done about as much for the commercial welfare of the state\r\nas all other industrial enterprises. In proportion to its area, the\r\nrailway mileage is greater than that of the surrounding states. The\r\nroads are well built and the rates of transportation are low.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ordinary trip-tickets, monthly time-tickets are\r\nissued to travellers, allowing the holders to travel when and where they\r\nplease within the limits of the state on all roads and lake-steamers.\r\nThese are sold to the traveller for about two-thirds the price of the\r\n1,000-mile book of the American railway. The carriage roads have no\r\nsuperiors, and they penetrate about every part of the state below the\r\nsnow line; they also cross the main passes of the Alps.\r\n\r\nThrough one or another of these passes most of the foreign traffic of\r\nthe state must be carried. To Genoa and Milan it crosses the Alps via\r\nthe St. Gotthard tunnel, or the Simplon Pass;[75] to Paris it goes by\r\nthe Rhone Valley; between Vienna and Switzerland, by the Arlberg tunnel;\r\nand to Germany or to Amsterdam through the valley of the Main.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this most excellent system of transportation, Switzerland\r\nis thronged with visiting tourists at all times of the year; moreover,\r\nit has always been the policy of the Swiss Government not only to\r\nprovide for them, but also to make the country attractive to them. The\r\nresult has shown the wisdom of the policy. Indeed, the foreign tourist\r\nhas become one of the chief sources of income of the Swiss people, and\r\nthe latter profit by the transaction to the amount of about forty\r\nmillion dollars a year.\r\n\r\nAbout all the raw material used in manufacture must be imported. The\r\ncotton is purchased mainly from the United States, and enters by way of\r\nMarseille. The raw silk is purchased from Italy, China, and Japan. Coal,\r\nsugar, food-stuffs, and steel are purchased from Germany, and this state\r\nsupplies about half the imports. From the United States are purchased\r\nwheat, cotton, and coal-oil.\r\n\r\nThe manufactures are intended for export. The fine cotton textiles sold\r\nto the United States are worth far more than the raw cotton purchased\r\ntherefrom. Silk textiles, straw wares, toys, watches, jewelry, and dairy\r\nproducts are leading exports. The surrounding states are the chief\r\nbuyers, and none of them competes with Switzerland to any extent in the\r\ncharacter of the exports.\r\n\r\n_Geneva_, situated at the head of the Rhone Valley, is the chief trade\r\ndepot; it is noted especially for the manufacture of watches, of which\r\nmany hundred thousand are made yearly. _Zurich_ is the centre of\r\nmanufactures of textiles and fine machinery. The silk-brocade industry\r\nis centred chiefly in this city and _Basel_.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhy did not France prosper commercially prior to the time of the\r\nrevolution of 1793?\r\n\r\nWhat are the chief natural advantages of the state in favor of\r\ncommercial development?\r\n\r\nIn what ways have the natural disadvantages of Switzerland been\r\novercome?\r\n\r\nHow has the loss of her colonies affected the industrial development of\r\nSpain?\r\n\r\nComparing Spain and Italy, which has the better situation with reference\r\nto the Suez Canal traffic?\r\n\r\nFrom the Statesman\'s Year-Book find the amount of foreign trade of each\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nFrom the Abstract of Statistics find the trade of each one with the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nAdams\'s New Empire, pp. 160-168.\r\n\r\nFiske\'s Discovery of America, Vol. II, Chapter XI.\r\n\r\nProcure for inspection specimens of raw silk and also of the choice\r\ntextile goods made in these states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nEUROPE--THE DANUBE AND BALKAN STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Danube and Balkan states derive their commercial importance partly\r\nfrom the large area in which bread-stuffs may be produced, and also\r\nbecause the valley of the Danube has become an overland trade-route of\r\ngrowing importance between the Suez Canal and the North Sea.\r\n\r\n=Austria-Hungary.=--This empire is composed of the two monarchies, Austria\r\nand Hungary, each practically self-governed, but united under a single\r\ngeneral government. The greater part of the country is walled in by the\r\nranges of the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe region known as the Tyrol is topographically continuous with\r\nSwitzerland, and the people have Swiss characteristics. Galicia,\r\nnortheast of the Carpathian Mountains, the fragment of Poland that fell\r\nto Austria at the time of partition, is a part of the great Russian\r\nplain. Bohemia, which derives its name from the Keltic peoples, whom\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar called the Boii, comprises the upper part of the Elbe river-basin.\r\nIts natural commercial outlet is Germany, but the race-hatred which the\r\nCzechs have for the Germans, retards commercial progress. Hungary is a\r\ncountry of plains occupying the lower basin of the Danube. The Huns are\r\nof Asian origin. Austria proper occupies the upper valley of the Danube,\r\nadjoining Germany; the country and the people are Germanic.\r\n\r\nTo the student of history it is a surprise that a country of such\r\ndiverse peoples, having but little in common save mutual race-hatred,\r\nshould hold together under the same general government. The explanation,\r\nhowever, is found in the topography of the region. The basin of the\r\nDanube is a great food-producing region, and the upper valley of the\r\nElbe River forms the easiest passage from the Black to the Baltic Sea.\r\nThe topography therefore gives the greater part of the country\r\ncommercial unity.\r\n\r\nThe climate and surface of the low plains of Hungary are much the same\r\nas those of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Grain-growing and stock-raising are\r\nthe chief employments. High freight rates, a long haul, and the\r\ncompetition of Russia and Roumania have retarded the development of\r\nthese industries, however. Bohemia is likewise a grain-growing country,\r\nand the easy route into Germany through the Elbe Valley makes the\r\nindustry a profitable one. Bohemia is also in the sugar-beet area.\r\n\r\nThere is an abundance of coal in Austria, but most of it is unfit for\r\nthe manufacture of iron and steel. Steel manufacture, however, is\r\ncarried on, the industry being protected by the distance from the German\r\nsteel-making centres. The lead-mines about Bleiberg (or "Leadville") are\r\nvery productive; at Idria are the only quicksilver-mines in Europe that\r\ncompete with those of Almaden, Spain. The salt-mines near Krakow are in\r\na mass of rock-salt twelve hundred feet thick.\r\n\r\nMost of the manufactured products are for home consumption. American\r\ncotton and home-grown wool supply the greater part of the textiles. The\r\nflour-mills are equipped with the very best of machinery, and much of\r\nthe product is for export to Germany and the countries to the south. The\r\nmanufactures that have made the state famous, however, are gloves and\r\nglassware, both of which are widely exported. The sand, fluxes, and\r\ncoloring minerals of Bohemian glassware are all peculiar to the region,\r\nand the wares, therefore, cannot be imitated elsewhere. The gloves are\r\nmade from the skins of Hungarian sheep and goats.\r\n\r\nThe railways are not well organized, and the mileage is insufficient for\r\nthe needs of the country. Ludwig Canal (in Germany) connects the Danube\r\nwith the Main, a navigable tributary of the Rhine; the Elbe is navigable\r\nfrom a point above Prague to the Baltic; the Moravian Gate opens a\r\npassage from Vienna northward; the Iron Gate, through which the Danube\r\nflows, is the route to the Black Sea; Semmering Pass and its tunnel is\r\nthe gateway to the ports of the Adriatic. These great routes practically\r\nconverge at Vienna, which also is the great railway centre of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nThe foreign trade consists mainly of the export of food-stuffs (of which\r\nsugar and eggs are heavy items), fine cabinet ware, woollen textiles\r\n(made from imported wool), barley and malt, and fine glassware. Much of\r\nthe German and Italian wine is sent to market in casks made of Austrian\r\nstock; the coal goes mainly to Italy. The imports are raw cotton from\r\nthe United States and Egypt, wool, silk, and tobacco. Coal is both\r\nexported and imported. The United States sells to Austria-Hungary\r\ncotton, pork, and corn--buying porcelain ware, glassware, and gloves,\r\namounting to about one-fifth the value of the exports.\r\n\r\n_Vienna_, the capital, is the financial centre and commercial\r\nclearing-house of central Europe; it has also extensive manufactures.\r\n_Budapest_ is the great focal point of Hungarian railways and commerce.\r\n_Prague_ controls the coal, textile, and glass trade of Bohemia.\r\n_Lemberg_ is the metropolis of Galicia. The states of Liechtenstein,\r\nBosnia, and Herzegovina are commercially under the control of Austria.\r\n\r\n=The Lower Danube States.=--Roumania and Bulgaria, the plain of the lower\r\nDanube, are enclosed by the Carpathian and Balkan ranges. They\r\nconstitute a great wheat-field whose chief commercial outlets are the\r\nIron Gate into Germanic Europe, and the Sulina mouth of the Danube into\r\nthe Black Sea. The growing of maize for home consumption and wheat for\r\nexport form the only noteworthy industries. Most of the grain is shipped\r\nup the Danube and sold in Great Britain and Germany.\r\n\r\nFrom the Iron Gate to the Black Sea the Danube is held as an\r\ninternational highway, and the control of its navigation is directed by\r\na commission of the various European powers, having its head-quarters at\r\nGalatz, Roumania.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURKEY AND GREECE]\r\n\r\nIn the Balkan Mountains is the famous Vale of Roses which furnishes\r\nabout half the world\'s supply of attar-of-roses. The petals of the\r\ndamask rose are pressed between layers of cloth saturated with lard. The\r\nlatter absorbs the essential oil, from which it is easily removed. About\r\nhalf a ton of roses are required to make a pound of the attar. Kazanlik,\r\nnoted also for rugs, is the great market for attar. _Galatz_ and\r\n_Rustchuk_ are grain-markets and river-ports; from the latter a railway\r\nextends to _Varna_, the chief port of the Black Sea. From _Sofia_, near\r\nthe Bulgarian frontier, a trunk line of railway extends through\r\nBudapest to western Europe.\r\n\r\n=Turkey-in-Europe.=--The European part of the Ottoman Empire has long been\r\npolitically known as the "Sick Man" of Europe, and so far as the\r\nindustries and commerce of the state are concerned, there is no excuse\r\nfor its separate existence as a state. Its political existence, however,\r\nis regarded as a necessity, in order to prevent the Russians from\r\nobtaining military and naval control of the Mediterranean and Black\r\nSeas, and thereby becoming a menace to all western Europe. Less than\r\none-half the people are Turks; the greater part of the population\r\nconsists of Armenians, Jews, Magyars, and Latins.\r\n\r\nMost of the country is rugged and unfit for grain-growing. The internal\r\ngovernment is bad, the taxes are so ruinous that the agricultural\r\nresources are undeveloped, and every sort of farming is primitive. In\r\nmany instances the taxes levied on the growing crops become practical\r\nconfiscation when they are collected. Much of the cultivable land is\r\nidle because there are no means of getting the crops to market.\r\n\r\nGrapes and wine, silk, opium, mohair and wool, valonia (acorn cups used\r\nin tanning leather), figs, hides, cigarettes, and carpets are the\r\nleading exports, and these about half pay for the American cotton\r\ntextiles, woollen goods, coal-oil, sugar, and other food-stuffs\r\nimported. Choice Mocha coffee is imported for home use, and poorer\r\ngrades are exported. Most of the foreign commerce is in the hands of\r\nEnglish and French merchants. Armenians, Jews, and Greeks are the native\r\nmiddlemen and traders.\r\n\r\nThe native population is subject to the Sultan, whose rule is absolute;\r\nmost foreign merchants and residents are permitted by treaties to remain\r\nsubject to the regulations of the consuls.\r\n\r\n_Constantinople_ is the capital. Its situation on the Bosphorus is such\r\nthat under any other European government it would command a tremendous\r\nforeign commerce. It is naturally the focal point of the trade between\r\nEurope and Asia. A trunk line of railway connects the city with Paris.\r\n_Salonica_ is the port of western Turkey, and is likewise connected by\r\nrail with western Europe. A great deal of the foreign commerce of the\r\nstate is now landed at this port.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARBOR OF CONSTANTINOPLE]\r\n\r\nThe chief possessions of the Ottoman Empire are Asia Minor, Armenia,\r\nMesopotamia, Syria, and Arabia.\r\n\r\n=Greece.=--Greece is a rugged peninsula, no part of which is more than\r\nforty miles from the sea. The country is without resources in the way of\r\ncoal, timber, or available capital. Its former commercial position, in\r\nancient times, was due largely to the silver-mines near Ergasteria, and\r\nsubsequently to the gold-mines of eastern Macedonia; these, however, are\r\nno longer productive.\r\n\r\nThere is but little land suitable for farming, and not far from one-half\r\nthe bread-stuffs must be imported. Much of the timber has been\r\ndestroyed, and this has resulted in a deterioration not only of the\r\nwater-power, but of the cultivable lands as well. The railway lines are\r\nshort and their business is local; there are practically no trunk line\r\nconnections with the great centres of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe harbors and the natural position of the country are its best\r\nremaining resources. The Greeks are born sailors, and the country is in\r\nthe pathway of European and Asian commerce. Most of the grain-trade\r\nbetween the Black and Mediterranean Seas is controlled by Greek\r\nmerchants, and the Greeks are everywhere in evidence in the carrying\r\ntrade of the Mediterranean. The construction of the Corinthian canal has\r\nalso given Greek commerce a material impetus.\r\n\r\nThe chief exports are Corinthian grapes--commonly known as\r\n"currants"--fruit, and iron ore from Ergasteria. Great Britain, France,\r\nand Belgium are the chief buyers of the fruit-crop. The exports scarcely\r\npay for the American cotton, Russian wheat, and the timber products that\r\nare purchased abroad. There has been a material growth in the\r\nmanufacture of cotton, woollens, and silk in the past few years, much of\r\nthe work being done in households. _Athens_ is the capital and largest\r\ncity. _The Pir\xc3\xa6us_ and _Patras_ are the chief ports.\r\n\r\n=Servia= and =Montenegro= are stock-growing countries. The former has\r\nsuffered greatly from misgovernment and the waste of its resources.\r\nWine-cask stock and cattle are sold to Austria, which has five-sixths of\r\nits trade. _Belgrade_ is its metropolis. Tobacco and live-stock are\r\nexported from Montenegro to Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nOn a good map of central Europe trace an all-water route from the mouth\r\nof the Danube to the ports of the lower Rhine and the North Sea; what\r\nconnection have the cities of Ratisbon and Lemberg with this route?\r\n\r\nHow do the forests of these states affect the wine industry of Germany?\r\n\r\nFrom the Statesman\'s Year-Book find the amount and movement of the\r\nexports and imports of these countries.\r\n\r\nFrom the Abstract of Statistics find the volume of trade of these\r\ncountries with the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL REFERENCE\r\n\r\nGreat Canals of the World--p. 4089.\r\n\r\nA good map of central Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN EMPIRE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nEUROPE-ASIA--THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great plain of Eurasia, which borders about half the circuit of the\r\nArctic Ocean, is undivided by topographic barriers or boundaries. It is\r\nphysically a unit.\r\n\r\n=Russia.=--Russia comprises more than one-half the area of Europe; the\r\nRussian Empire embraces about one-half of Europe and Asia combined, and\r\nconstitutes more than one-seventh of the land surface of the earth. East\r\nand west, from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok, the distance is about six\r\nthousand miles. It has a similar position with respect to southern\r\nEurope and China as has Canada to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn latitude the country is unfortunately situated. North of the latitude\r\nof St. Petersburg the climate is too cold to grow bread-stuffs; a large\r\npart of the country is, therefore, unproductive. The central belt is\r\nforest-covered; the southern part, or "black earth" belt, comprises the\r\ngreater part of the productive lands, and this region is the chief\r\ngranary of Europe.\r\n\r\nRussia is an agricultural country. Maize and rye grown for home\r\nconsumption, and wheat for export, are the chief products. Flax is a\r\nleading export product, and the Russian crop constitutes about\r\nfour-fifths of the world\'s supply. Lands too remote from markets for\r\ngrain-growing produce cattle and sheep, which are grown mainly for their\r\nhides and tallow. The wool of the Don is a very coarse textile that is\r\nmuch used in the manufacture of American carpets; that of the arid\r\nplateaus of the southern country is a fine rug wool.\r\n\r\nAgriculture in Russia is on a much lower plane than in western Europe.\r\nMost of the land is owned in large estates. Individual farming is rare,\r\nland tillage being usually a community affair. A village community rents\r\nor purchases a tract of land, and the latter is allotted to the families\r\ncomposing it, a part of the land being reserved for pasturage. The\r\nbusiness is transacted by "elders," or trustees, who exercise a general\r\nmanagement and supervision over the "mir," or community.\r\n\r\nThe methods of farming are not the best, and an acre of land produces\r\nscarcely one-third as much as the same area is made to yield in other\r\nstates. The farming class, or peasantry, was in a condition of serfdom\r\nuntil within a few years. Poverty unfits them to compete with farmers of\r\nwestern Europe; moreover, the laws of land ownership and tenure also\r\nserve to discourage farming.\r\n\r\nThe metal and mineral resources are very great. Iron ore is abundant,\r\nand the yearly output of both is greatly increasing. There are extensive\r\ndeposits in southern Russia, in the Ural Mountains, and in Poland. Coal\r\nof good quality is plentiful, and coal mining is encouraged by a heavy\r\ntariff on the foreign coal that enters regions where the home product is\r\navailable. The most productive coal-fields are those of the lower Don\r\nRiver and of Poland.\r\n\r\nGold is obtained in various parts of Siberia and in the Ural Mountains,\r\nbut scarcely enough is mined for the requirements of coinage. Copper is\r\nalso mined in the Ural and Caucasus Mountains. More than nine-tenths of\r\nthe world\'s supply of platinum is also obtained in the Ural Mountains.\r\nThe petroleum fields of Transcaucasia have a yearly output a little\r\ngreater than those of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe forest area is surpassed only by the timber belt of North America,\r\nboth of which are in about the same latitudes. This area, within a very\r\nfew years, is destined to be the chief lumber supply of all Europe.\r\nMoreover, the forests, the grain-growing lands, and the iron and coal\r\nconstitute national resources which are surpassed in no other countries\r\nsave the United States and China.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Government has done much to encourage manufactures.\r\nSteel-making in the Ural district, in Poland, and in the iron regions of\r\nthe Don has progressed to the extent that home-made railway material and\r\nrolling stock are now generally used. Farming machinery is made in the\r\ncities of the grain-growing region. The manufacture of cotton, woollen,\r\nand linen fabrics has developed to the extent that the state is becoming\r\nan exporter rather than an importer of such goods.\r\n\r\nRailway building has progressed under government aid, and about\r\ntwo-thirds of the 37,000 miles of track are owned by the state. The\r\nTranssiberian Railway connecting Vladivostok with the trunk lines of\r\nEurope was built by the state both for strategic and economic purposes.\r\nLarge bodies of emigrants are carried into Siberia at nominal rates and\r\nare settled on lands that are practically free. The return cargoes\r\nconsist of Chinese products--mainly silk textiles and tea--destined for\r\nwestern Europe.\r\n\r\nA network of railways covers the grain-growing districts; trunk lines,\r\nmainly for strategic purposes, extend through Russian Turkestan to the\r\nChinese border. For many years Russia has endeavored to acquire the\r\nterritory that would afford commercial outlets to the Indian Ocean and\r\ninto China. In this the state has been thwarted by two great\r\npowers--Great Britain and Japan. The construction of canals and the\r\nimprovements of river-navigation are under government management, and\r\nthe internal water-ways aggregate about fifty thousand miles of\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\nThe foreign commerce is changing in character as manufactures develop.\r\nWheat, flour, timber products, flax, and petroleum are the chief\r\nexports. Cotton, tea, wool, and coal are the leading imports, the\r\nfirst-named coming mainly from the United States. Germany, Great\r\nBritain, France, Holland, and the United States are the chief European\r\ncountries utilizing Russian trade. The commerce between Russia and China\r\nis growing rapidly. The Transsiberian railway is its chief northern\r\noutlet, and a branch of this road, now under construction, extends\r\nthrough to the leading commercial centres of Manchuria, to Port Arthur.\r\nA considerable amount of manufactured goods is sent to Asia Minor and\r\nthe Iran countries.\r\n\r\nThe most available ports opening into the Atlantic are on the Baltic\r\nSea, but these are blocked by ice in winter; the best ports are on the\r\nBlack Sea, but the Russians do not control the navigable waters that\r\nconnect them with the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nMuch of the internal trade is carried on by means of annual fairs. The\r\nmost important of these are held at _Nijni_, (lower) _Novgorod_,\r\n_Kharkof_, _Kief_, and other points. At the first-named fair goods to\r\nthe amount of $80,000,000 have changed hands during a single season, and\r\nthe annual fair is the recognized common ground on which the oriental\r\ntraders meet the buyers of European and American firms.\r\n\r\nUnlike the schemes of colonization of other European states, the various\r\npossessions of the Czar are practically in a single area, the\r\ndependencies being contiguous. The lines between them, with few\r\nexceptions, are political rather than natural boundaries.\r\n\r\n_St. Petersburg_, the capital, is the centre of finance and trade.\r\n_Riga_ is the port from which most of the lumber is exported; it\r\nreceives the coal purchased from Great Britain for the factories of the\r\nBaltic coast. The harbor of Riga is not greatly obstructed by ice.\r\n_Archangel_ has an export trade of lumber and flax during the few months\r\nwhen the White Sea is free from ice. _Odessa_ and _Rostof_ are the\r\ngrain-markets of the empire. _Astrakhan_ is the centre of trade for the\r\nIran countries, and _Baku_ is the petroleum-market. _Moscow_ is the\r\nchief focal point of the railways; and in consequence has become a great\r\ncentre of manufacture and trade. _Warsaw_, next to Moscow, is the most\r\nimportant city.\r\n\r\n=Siberia.=--This great territory resembles Russia in surface and climatic\r\nfeatures. Like the former "west" of the United States, Siberia is the\r\nopen "east" into which much of the surplus population of Russia,\r\nGermany, and the Scandinavian countries is moving, attracted by fine\r\nfarming lands. The European emigrant becomes a producer when settled in\r\nSiberia, and, at the same time, a consumer of Russian manufactures. In\r\nfive years more than one million people thus became occupants of the new\r\ncountry in Siberia. Russian trade is encouraged by a heavy tariff on\r\nforeign goods brought into Siberia.\r\n\r\n_Tobolsk_, _Tomsk_, and _Semipalatinsk_ are collecting stations for\r\nSiberian products, and each is built on navigable waters. _Irkutsk_\r\nreceives the caravan trade that goes from Peking through _Urga_ and\r\n_Kiakhta_, the frontier post of Chinese trade. _Vladivostok_ is the\r\ngreat Pacific outlet and the terminus of the Transsiberian Railway. It\r\nis ice-bound in winter. _Harbin_, in Manchuria, China, is a Russian\r\ntrading post of great commercial importance.\r\n\r\n=Bokhara= and =Khiva= are Russian vassal states. The former was acquired\r\nchiefly as a trade-route. A railway from _Krasnovodsk_ on the Caspian\r\nSea extends through _Merv_, _Bokhara_, and _Samarkand_ to _Kashgar_,\r\nwhere it meets the caravan trade from central China. The building of\r\nthis railway has caused a great development of cotton-growing in these\r\ncountries, which furnish Europe and America with the choice Afghan,\r\nKhiva, and Bokhara rugs.\r\n\r\n=Transcaucasia=, now joined to Russia, is a part of the plateau of Iran. A\r\nrailway extends across the country from _Batum_ to _Baku_, connecting\r\nthe Black and Caspian Seas. Transcaucasia is the petroleum region of the\r\nEast. It is also noted for the Shirvan, Kabistan, Daghestan, and Kazak\r\nrugs which are sold all over Europe and America. The so-called\r\n"Cashmere" rugs are not a product of Kashmir, but are made in the town\r\nof _Shemaka_. Kabistan rugs are made in _Kuba_. Kazak fabrics are\r\nusually the sleeping-blankets of the Kazak (Cossack) rough-riders.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nHow will the development of the coal, iron, and lumber resources most\r\nlikely affect the industrial future of Russia?\r\n\r\nDiscuss the policy of Siberian immigration;--what are its advantages to\r\nGerman colonists?\r\n\r\nFrom the map accompanying this chapter show how the tributary streams of\r\nthe great rivers have served to extend Russian commerce through Siberia.\r\n\r\nNote the situation of the cities and towns of Siberia with reference to\r\nthe rivers.\r\n\r\nWhat effect has the high latitude of Russia on its agricultural\r\nindustries?\r\n\r\nFrom the Statesman\'s Year-Book make a list of the leading exports and\r\nimports of Russia by articles, and also the volume of trade with other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nFrom the Abstract of Statistics find the statistics of trade between\r\nRussia and the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nCommercial life in Russia--preferably from the article, "Russia," in the\r\nEncyclop\xc3\xa6dia Britannica.\r\n\r\nFor a rug of the Caucasus type, see illustration, p. 351; compare the\r\nKabistan with the Persian piece--which has the floral and which the\r\ngeometric figures?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE IRAN PLATEAU AND ARABIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe countries of the Iran plateau extend from the Mediterranean Sea to\r\nthe valley of the Indus River. The Arabian Peninsula is not a part of\r\nit, but its climate and general character are similar. The Iran\r\ncountries are exceedingly rugged, and a great part of their surface is\r\nmore than a mile above sea-level. The climate is one of great extremes;\r\nthe summer hot-waves and the winter hurricanes are probably unknown\r\nelsewhere in severity. The greater part of Arabia is an unhabitable\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RUG-MAKING COUNTRIES]\r\n\r\nThe rigorous conditions of surface and climate have placed their stamp\r\nupon the population of the region. They are full of the intelligent\r\ncunning and ferocity that mark people living under such conditions of\r\nenvironment. In many parts the sterile soil and arid climate force the\r\nsparse population into nomadic habits of life and predatory pursuits.\r\nFor the greater part, the land hardly yields enough food-stuffs for the\r\npopulation, and any great development of agriculture is out of the\r\nquestion. The flood-plain of the Tigris and Euphrates, and a few of the\r\nriver-valleys are highly productive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ANTIQUE TREE-OF-LIFE, KERMANSHAH (PERSIAN) RUG]\r\n\r\nBefore the Christian era several trade-routes between Europe and the\r\nOrient lay across this region, and along the caravan routes there were\r\nthe usual industries pertaining to commercial peoples. The cities of\r\nSinope, Trebizond, Astrabad, Phasis, Mashad, and Bactra (now Balkh) grew\r\ninto existence along one of the northern routes. Tyre, Nineveh, Tarsus,\r\nPalmyra, Babylon, and Persepolis were founded along one or another of\r\nthe southern routes. Of these, Trebizond only retains its importance,\r\nbeing a seaport with a considerable trade. The commerce that once passed\r\nover this route was crushed out of existence during the invasions by\r\nJenghis Khan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A KABISTAN RUG--CAUCASUS DISTRICT]\r\n\r\nOf the various industries of the Iran plateau, practically but one\r\nextends beyond its borders, namely, the manufacture of the textile\r\nfabrics known as Oriental rugs. These are unique; they are made of\r\nmaterials, colored with dyes, and are ornamented with designs that\r\ncannot be successfully imitated anywhere else in the world. The filling\r\nof the rugs consists of fine wool, selected not only from particular\r\nlocalities, but also from certain parts of the fleece. The dye-stuffs\r\nare common to other parts of the world, and their names--indigo,\r\nsaffron, coccus, madder, and orchil--are familiar. But both the wool and\r\nthe dye-stuffs possess qualities imparted to them by soil and climate\r\nthat are not found elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe absence of floors, and of the furniture found in European dwellings,\r\nmake the rugs essential household articles rather than luxuries. The\r\nhearth-rug, the bath-mat, the divan-cover, the sleeping-blanket, and the\r\nsaddle-mat must be regarded as necessities. Religion also has its\r\nrequirements, and the prayer rug, sometimes ornamented with the hands of\r\nthe Prophet, is a part of every household equipment, whether of the\r\nnomadic Arab or the wealthy merchant. Each district and people have\r\ntheir own designs and methods of workmanship, and the rugs of each are\r\neasily distinguished.[76]\r\n\r\nFor the greater part these are gathered by caravans and conveyed to\r\nconvenient shipping-points. Nearly all the cottage-made product is\r\nobtained in this manner. As a rule the rugs are named from the town or\r\ndistrict in which they are made. Smyrna and Constantinople are the chief\r\nports of shipment. Many of them find their way to European dealers, but\r\nNew York is probably the largest rug-market in the world. The great\r\nmajority are retailed at from ten to fifty dollars each; choice\r\nfabrics, however, bring from three hundred to ten thousand dollars.\r\nOriental rugs are hand-woven, and a weaver frequently spends several\r\nyears on a single piece, earning perhaps less than ten cents a day. The\r\nfactory-made rugs are inferior to the cottage-manufactured product.\r\n\r\n=Turkish Possessions.=--Anatolia is the common name of the Turkish\r\npossession formerly known as Asia Minor. The name properly belongs,\r\nhowever, to only a small part of the region. The Asiatic possessions of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire comprise Asia Minor, Armenia, Kurdistan, Syria,\r\nMesopotamia, and Arabia. The Armenians are the commercial people of the\r\ngreater part of this region, and although thousands have been massacred\r\nbecause of Turkish hatred of them, they practically wield the chief\r\npower because of their business enterprise.\r\n\r\nDuring the Roman occupation many miles of roads were built from\r\nConstantinople and other coast-points to the interior. One of these\r\nextended to Mesopotamia, and became a much-travelled route of the trade\r\nwhich centred at Constantinople. Within recent years German capitalists\r\nhave built railways along these roads, thereby creating a considerable\r\nexport trade in fruit, rugs, and mohair cloth.\r\n\r\n_Angora_ and _Konieh_ (_Iconium_) are important marts. _Trebizond_ is\r\nthe chief port of the Black Sea, but it lacks railway connections with\r\nthe interior. _Smyrna_ is the chief port of the Mediterranean, and from\r\nit are shipped to European and American markets the fruit and textile\r\nfabrics that have made its importance. In Syria, _Damascus_, one of the\r\noldest cities in the world, is the centre of a considerable trade in\r\ntextile manufactures. Rugs, dates, figs, and damask fabrics are exported\r\nto Europe through _Beirut_, its seaport, with which it is connected by\r\nrail. Much of the stuffs exported is gathered from Persia. _Yafa_ is\r\nthe port of Jerusalem. _Bagdad_ is the chief trade-centre of\r\nMesopotamia.\r\n\r\n=Arabia.=--Arabia is nominally a Turkish possession, but the coast-regions\r\nonly are under the control of the Sultan. The interior is peopled by\r\nnomadic tribes, who do not acknowledge the sovereignty of Turkey. The\r\nprovince of Yemen, on the Red Sea, is about the only noteworthy part of\r\nthe peninsula. Hides and Mocha coffee, gathered by Arab traders, are\r\nshipped from the port of _Hodeida_. _Mecca_ is the yearly meeting-place\r\nof thousands of Mohammedan pilgrims, who go thither as a religious duty;\r\nit is also the centre from which Asiatic cholera radiates. _Aden_, the\r\nchief coaling-station of the British Empire in the Indian Ocean, is also\r\na free port, having a considerable trade in American cotton and\r\ncoal-oil.\r\n\r\nAlthough Arabia itself is practically of no commercial importance, the\r\nsame cannot be said of the Arabic people. They are keen, thrifty\r\ntraders, and as brutal in their instincts as they are keen. The commerce\r\nwhich connects the western part of Asia with Europe is largely of their\r\nmaking. They collect and transport the goods from the interior,\r\ndelivering them to Jewish and Armenian middlemen, who turn them over to\r\nEuropean and American merchants. Arab traders also control the greater\r\npart of the commerce of northern Africa. The slave-trade, which is\r\nwholly in their hands, is very largely the key to the situation. A party\r\nof slave-dealers makes an attack upon a village and, after massacring\r\nall who are not able-bodied, load the rest with the goods to be\r\ntransported to the coast.\r\n\r\n=Persia.=--Persia is the modernized name of the province now called Fars,\r\nor Farsistan. Within its borders, however, the name Persia is almost\r\nunknown; the native people call the country Iran. In the times of\r\nCyrus, Xerxes, and Darius, Persia was one of the great powers of the\r\nworld. The cultivable lands produced an abundance of food-stuffs. The\r\nmines of copper, lead, silver, and iron were worked to their utmost\r\nextent, and the chief trade-routes between Europe and the Orient crossed\r\nthe country to the Indus River.\r\n\r\nThe conquest by Alexander the Great changed the course of trade and\r\ndiverted it to other routes, thus depriving the country of much of its\r\nrevenue; the invasions of the Arabs left the empire a hopeless wreck.\r\nIran blood dominates the country at the present time, it is true, but\r\nthe religion of Islam does not encourage any material development, and\r\nthe industries are now purely local. There is no organization of trade,\r\nnor any system of transportation except by means of wretched wagon-roads\r\nwith innumerable toll-gates. "Turkish" tobacco, opium, and small fruits\r\nare grown for export; silk and wool, however, are the most important\r\ncrops. The former is manufactured into brocaded textiles; the latter\r\ninto rugs and carpets. There are famous pearl-fisheries in the Persian\r\nGulf.\r\n\r\n_Tabriz_, situated in the midst of an agricultural region, has important\r\nmanufactures of shawls and silk fabrics of world renown. The Tabriz rugs\r\nare regarded as among the finest of the rug-maker\'s art. _Shiraz_, the\r\nformer capital, _Kermanshah_,[77] and _Hamadan_ are noted for rug and\r\ncarpet manufactures. _Mashad_ is the centre of the trade with Russia.\r\n_Bushire_ and _Bender-Abbas_ are seaports, but have no great importance.\r\nMost of the trade with Russia passes through the port of Trebizond.\r\n\r\n=Afghanistan.=--The nomadic tribes that inhabit Afghanistan have but\r\nlittle in common with the British civilization that is slowly but surely\r\nclosing in upon them, and driving them from routes of commerce. A\r\nconsiderable local traffic is carried on between Bokhara and Herat, and\r\nbetween Bokhara and Kabul through Balkh, all being fairly prosperous\r\ncentres of population in regions made productive by irrigation.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important route lies between Kabul and Peshawur, at the\r\nhead of the Indus River. A railway, the Sind-Pishin, extends along the\r\nvalley of this river from Karachi, a port of British India, to Peshawur,\r\nalso in British India near the Afghan border, and the route lies thence\r\nthrough Khaibar Pass to Jelalabad and Kabul. A branch of this road is\r\ncompleted through Bolan Pass nearly to Kandahar.\r\n\r\n_Kabul_, the capital, is a military stronghold rather than a business\r\ncentre, although it is a collection depot for the Khiva-Bokhara rugs and\r\ncarpets that are marketed at Peshawur. _Kandahar_ has a growing trade\r\nresulting from the railway of the Indus Valley. _Herat_ is the market of\r\nthe famous Herati rugs. There is no organized commercial system; a small\r\namount of British manufactures--mainly stuffs for domestic use--are\r\nimported; rugs and dried fruit are the only exports to Europe and\r\nAmerica. The imports enter mainly by way of Karachi, India; the exports\r\nare carried to Europe, for the greater part, by the Russian railway.\r\n\r\nThe importance of Afghanistan is due to its position as a buffer state\r\nbetween Russia and British India. The various strategic points for\r\nyears, therefore, have been military strongholds. There is an old\r\nsaying: "Whoso would be master of India must first make himself lord of\r\nKabul." The meaning of this is seen in the history of Khaibar Pass,\r\nwhich for many years has been a scene of slaughter; indeed, it has been\r\nthe chief gateway between occidental and oriental civilizations for\r\nmore than twenty centuries. Since the acquisition of India by Great\r\nBritain Afghanistan has been under British protectoracy.\r\n\r\n=Baluchistan.=--The general features of Baluchistan resemble those of the\r\nother parts of the Iran plateau. The coast has no harbors in the proper\r\nsense, but the anchorage off _Gwador_ has fair protection from storms\r\nand heavy winds. The few valleys produce enough food-stuffs for the\r\nhalf-savage population. There is but little organization to the\r\ngovernment save that which is military in character. The state is a\r\nprotectorate of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nRug-making is the only industry that connects Baluchistan with the rest\r\nof the world. _Quetta_, the largest town, is a military station\r\ncontrolling Bolan Pass. Its outlet is the Kandahar branch of the\r\nSind-Pishin Railway.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat climatic factors prevent these countries from being regions of\r\ngreat production?\r\n\r\nHow do climate and soil affect the character of the wool clip?\r\n\r\nHow do Arabian horses compare with American thorough-bred stock with\r\nrespect to usefulness?--how do they compare with the mustang stock?\r\n\r\nWhy is Khaibar Pass regarded as the key to India?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nFrom a cyclop\xc3\xa6dia (or from McCarthy\'s History of Our Own Times) read an\r\naccount of the British disaster at Kabul.\r\n\r\nStudy, if possible, one or more rugs of the following kinds, noting the\r\ncolors, designs, and warp of each: Bokhara (antique and modern),\r\nAnatolian, Kermanshah, and Baluchistan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nBRITISH INDIA AND THE EAST INDIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThese countries are in tropical latitudes and in the main are regions of\r\ngreat productivity. A few native states that have resisted annexation\r\nand conquest excepted, almost the entire area is divided among Great\r\nBritain, Holland, and France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIA]\r\n\r\n=British India.=--The Empire of India comprises an area half as large as\r\nthe United States, situated on the southern slope of Asia. It covers the\r\nsame latitude as the span between the Venezuelan coast and the Ohio\r\nRiver; from the Indus to the Siam frontier the distance is about two\r\nthousand miles. It includes also settlements in the Malay peninsula.\r\n\r\nExcepting the plateau of the Dekkan, and the slopes of the Himalayan\r\nranges, most of the surface consists of plains and low, rolling land\r\ncovered with a great depth of soil. Through these rich lands flow four\r\nlarge rivers--the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Irawadi, which afford\r\na great deal of internal communication. The Himalaya Mountains on the\r\nnorth and the Hindu Kush on the northwest practically shut off\r\ncommunication from the northward, so that all communication in this\r\ndirection is concentrated at Khaibar and Bolan Passes, the most\r\nimportant gateways by land approach.\r\n\r\nBritish India is one of the most populous regions of the world; the\r\naverage population per square mile is about one hundred and eighty, a\r\ndensity considerably greater than that of New York State. The entire\r\npopulation is about three times that of the United States. Nearly all\r\nthe food-stuffs grown are required for home consumption; indeed, dry\r\nyears are apt to be followed by a shortage of food-stuffs. Years ago\r\nfamines followed any considerable deficiency of crops, but since the\r\ncompletion of the admirable railway systems the necessary food-stuffs\r\nare quickly shipped to the district where the shortage occurs.\r\n\r\nThe Hindus constitute about three-fourths of the population. Along the\r\nnorthern border there are many peoples of Afghan and Turkic descent; in\r\nBurma there is a considerable admixture of Mongol blood. An elaborate\r\nsystem of social castes imposed by the teachings of Brahmanism has made\r\nthe introduction of western methods of education and civilization\r\nsomewhat difficult to carry out. The educational system of the\r\ndominating Brahmanic caste, although of a very high order, does not fit\r\nthe people to cope with the commercialism of western civilization.\r\n\r\nFive-sevenths of the population are engaged in agricultural labor. Rice,\r\nwheat, millet, meat, and sugar are the chief food-crops. Of these, rice\r\nand wheat[78] only are exported; the others are required for home\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nThe articles grown for export are jute, cotton, opium, oil-yielding\r\nseeds, tea, and opium. No meat is exported, but hides form a large item\r\nof foreign trade.\r\n\r\nThe jute is used in the manufacture of rugs and grain-sacks. It is\r\ncultivated mainly in the delta-lands of the Ganges-Brahmaputra. A\r\nconsiderable part of the product is now manufactured in India and in\r\nChina; some is also shipped to California, to be made into wheat-sacks;\r\nperhaps the larger part is sent to Dundee, Scotland, where it is woven\r\ninto textile fabrics. The choicest product is used to mix with silk\r\nfibre, or is employed in the manufacture of rugs and coverings.\r\n\r\nCotton cultivation is rapidly taking first rank among the industries of\r\nIndia, for which the conditions of soil, climate, and market are\r\nadmirably adapted. India stands second in cotton-growing, and the area\r\nof production is gradually increasing. Most of the crop is exported to\r\nEurope for manufacture, although there is an increasing amount sold to\r\nJapan. Great Britain is the largest purchaser, and the cotton goods\r\nmanufactured at Manchester are reshipped in large quantities to India.\r\n\r\nOwing to the low wages paid for labor both in the fields and the mills,\r\ncotton manufacture is a rapidly growing industry in India. In many cases\r\nthe yarn is manufactured in India and then sent to China to be made into\r\ncoarse cloth. Some of the mills are equipped with machinery made in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nTea has become one of the most important crops of India. It is grown\r\nmainly in Ceylon and Assam, and is said to have grown wild in the latter\r\nstate. The quality of Indian tea is regarded as superior to the Chinese\r\nproduct, and Indian teas have therefore very largely supplanted those of\r\nChina, in British consumption.\r\n\r\nSilk cultivation and manufacture have been growing rapidly in the past\r\nfew years; a considerable part of the product is "tussar," or wild silk.\r\nThe silk rugs of India are not equalled anywhere else in the world. Wool\r\nis a product of the mountain-regions, but is almost wholly used in the\r\nmanufacture of rugs and coverings.\r\n\r\nThe British occupation of India is commercial rather than political.\r\nIndia furnishes a most valuable market for British manufactures; it\r\nsupplies the British people with a large amount of raw material for\r\nmanufacture. The general government is administrative only so far as the\r\nconstruction of railways, irrigating canals, and harbors, and the\r\norganization of financial affairs are concerned.\r\n\r\nThere are about two hundred and fifty native states included within the\r\nterritory of British India. In addition to the native ruler, a British\r\ngovernor or magistrate carries out the administrative features of the\r\nBritish Government. For administrative purposes most of the native\r\nstates are grouped into eight provinces, or "presidencies."\r\n\r\n=Bengal.=--The states of Bengal, mainly in the valley of the Ganges River,\r\nproduce most of the rice and wheat. _Calcutta_, the capital of the\r\nempire, is a comparatively young city. The Hugli at this point is\r\nnavigable both for ocean and river craft. The situation of the city is\r\nmuch like that of New York, and it is therefore finely adapted for\r\ncommerce. Railways extending from the various food-producing districts\r\nand from other centres of commerce converge at Calcutta. The city is not\r\nonly the centre of administration, but the chief focus of commerce and\r\nfinance as well.\r\n\r\n=Bombay.=--Bombay includes a number of states bordering on the Arabian\r\nSea. The city of _Bombay_ is built on an island of the same name. Its\r\nsituation on the west coast makes it the most convenient port for the\r\nEuropean trade that passes through the Suez Canal. The opening of the\r\nroute gave Bombay a tremendous growth, and it is destined to become a\r\ngreat commercial factor in Indian Ocean trade. It is also a great\r\nmanufacturing centre for cotton textiles. _Ahmedabad_, an important\r\nmilitary station, is also an important centre of cotton manufacture and\r\nwheat-trade.\r\n\r\n=Sind.=--The native state Sind includes the greater part of the basin of\r\nthe Indus. Its importance is military and strategic rather than\r\ncommercial. The ability of Great Britain to hold India depends very\r\nlargely on British control of the Indus Valley and the passes leading\r\nfrom it. The Sind-Pishin Railway traverses the Indus Valley from Karachi\r\nto Peshawur. _Haidarabad_, one of the largest cities of India, is the\r\ncentre of an agricultural district. _Karachi_, the port near the mouth\r\nof the Indus, next to Khaibar Pass, is the most important strategic\r\npoint of India, and one that the Russians for more than a century have\r\nbeen trying to possess.\r\n\r\n=Punjab.=--The states of the Punjab are mainly at the upper part of the\r\nIndus. _Amritsar_ is an important centre for the manufacture of silk\r\nrugs and carpets. A large number of these are sold in the United States\r\nat prices varying from two hundred to six thousand dollars. The designs\r\nfor these textiles are often made in New York. _Peshawur_ is important\r\nchiefly as a military station.\r\n\r\n=Burma.=--British Burma includes the basin of the Irawadi River. The\r\nuplands are wheat-fields; the lowlands produce rice. _Mandalay_ is a\r\nriver-port and commercial centre. _Rangoon_ is the seaport, with a\r\nconsiderable ship-building industry that results from the teak forests.\r\nAlthough the Irawadi is navigable for light craft, railways along the\r\nvalley have become a necessity; these centre at Rangoon.\r\n\r\nThe province of Madras is one of the most densely peopled parts of\r\nIndia. The chief commercial products are cotton and teak-wood. _Madras_,\r\nits commercial centre, has a very heavy foreign trade in hides, spices,\r\nand cotton. The cotton manufactures are extensive. A yarn-dyed cotton\r\ncloth, now imitated both in Europe and the United States, has made the\r\nname famous.\r\n\r\n=Kashmir.=--The native state Kashmir, situated high on the slopes of the\r\nKarakorum Mountains, is known chiefly for the "Cashmere" shawls made\r\nthere. The shawls are hand-woven and represent the highest style of the\r\nweaver\'s art. The best require many years each in the making; they\r\ncommand prices varying from five hundred to five thousand dollars. This\r\nindustry centres at _Srinagar_.\r\n\r\n=Other British States.=--The Straits Settlements are so called because\r\nthey face the Straits of Malacca. They include several colonies, chief\r\nof which are Singapore, Penang, and Malacca. The Straits ports are free\r\nfrom export and import duties, a regulation designed to encourage the\r\nconcentration of Malaysian products there--in other words, to encourage\r\na transit trade.\r\n\r\nThe policy has proved a wise one, and the trade at the three\r\nports--_Singapore_, _Penang_, and _Malacca_--aggregates about six\r\nhundred million dollars yearly. About two-thirds of this sum represents\r\nthe business of Singapore. Tin constitutes about half the exports, a\r\nlarge share going to the United States. Spices, rubber, gutta-percha,\r\ntapioca, and rattan constitute the remaining trade. Rice, cotton cloth,\r\nand opium are the imports.\r\n\r\nThe Federated Malay States, situated in the Malay peninsula, and the\r\nnorthern part of Borneo are also British possessions. Their trade and\r\nproducts are similar to the rest of the Malaysian possessions.\r\n\r\n=Dutch East India.=--The Dutch possessions include nearly all the islands\r\nof the Malay Archipelago and the western part of New Guinea. Of these,\r\nJava and Sumatra are the most important. They are divided into\r\n"residencies," and the administering officers exercise control over the\r\nvarious plantations. In addition, there are numerous private\r\nplantations. The colonial administration is admirable.\r\n\r\nCane-sugar, coffee, rice, indigo, pepper, tobacco, and tea are the chief\r\nproducts. The sugar industry has been somewhat crippled by the\r\nbeet-sugar product of Europe. Java and Sumatra coffees are in demand all\r\nover Europe and the United States. Sumatra wrappers for cigars find also\r\na ready market wherever cigars are manufactured. The cultivation of\r\ncinchona, or Peruvian bark, has proved successful, and this substance is\r\nbecoming an important export. The islands of Banka and Billiton (with\r\nRiouw) yield a very large part of the world\'s supply of tin, much of\r\nwhich goes finally to the United States. The mother-country profits by\r\nthe trade of these islands in two ways: the Dutch merchants are\r\npractically middlemen who create and manage the commerce; the Dutch\r\nGovernment receives an import tax of six per cent., and a small export\r\ntax on nearly all articles except sugar. _Batavia_ is the focal point of\r\nthe commerce.\r\n\r\n=Siam.=--This kingdom is chiefly important as a buffer state between\r\nFrench and British India, and little by little has been pared by these\r\nnations until practically nothing but the basin of the Menam River\r\nremains. The administration of the state is progressive, and much of the\r\nresources have been developed in the last few years.\r\n\r\nRice and teak are the leading products. The rice is cultivated by\r\nnative laborers--much of it by enforced labor--and is sold to Hongkong,\r\nBritish India, and the more northerly states. It is collected by Chinese\r\nmiddlemen, and by them sold to British and German exporters. The\r\nteak-wood business is managed by British firms. The logs are cut by\r\nnatives, hauled to the Menam River, and floated to Bangkok; there they\r\nare squared and sent to European markets. Pepper and preserved fish are\r\nalso exported. The Menam River is the chief trade-route, and _Bangkok_,\r\nat its mouth, is the focal point of trade.\r\n\r\n=French India.=--The French control the region south of China, called\r\nFrench Indo-China, together with various areas in the peninsula of\r\nHindustan; of these Pondicheri and Karical are the most important.\r\nIndo-China includes the basin of Mekong River, and rice is the staple\r\nproduct. The most productive rice-fields are the delta-lands of the\r\nMekong, formerly known as Cochin-China.\r\n\r\nFrom these lands more than half a million tons of rice are exported, the\r\nproduct being sold mainly at Hongkong and Singapore. Pepper is also an\r\nexport of considerable value. France, China, and the Philippine Islands\r\nare the final destination of the rice export. The imports are mainly\r\ntextiles, machinery, and coal-oil from the United States. The machinery\r\npertains chiefly to the manufactures of cotton and silk textiles. On\r\naccount of cheaply mined coal, there is a considerable growth of this\r\nindustry. _Saigon_ is the business centre and port at which the Chinese\r\nmiddlemen meet the European merchants and forwarders.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhat have been the chief effects of the British occupation of these\r\ncountries, so far as the natives are concerned?\r\n\r\nWhat is the position of Khaibar Pass with respect to the commerce of\r\nIndia?\r\n\r\nHow has the building of the Sind-Pishin Railway strengthened British\r\noccupation of India?\r\n\r\nSingapore and Batavia are the two great focal points of trade in the\r\nEast India Islands. At the former all trade is absolutely free; at the\r\nlatter there is both an import and an export tax. What are the\r\nadvantages of each policy?\r\n\r\nFrom the Abstract of Statistics find the trade of the United States with\r\nthese countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nFrom a cyclop\xc3\xa6dia, preferably the Encyclop\xc3\xa6dia Britannica, read the\r\nfollowing topics:\r\n\r\n  Caste\r\n  Lord Clive\r\n  Rattan\r\n  Pepper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nCHINA AND JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relative position of China, Russia, and Japan is not unlike that of\r\ncontinental Europe and Great Britain, and the struggle for supremacy in\r\nthe Japan and Yellow Seas is about the same as that which in times past\r\ntook place in the North Sea. In the latter case France and Holland were\r\nthe disturbing powers; in the former, it is Russia.\r\n\r\n=The Chinese Empire.=--A comparison of the Chinese Empire with the United\r\nStates shows that the two countries have about the same position and\r\nextent of latitude. There is also about the same proportion of\r\nhighlands, arid lands, and fertile lowlands. The similarity of the two\r\ncountries in geographic conditions is very marked.\r\n\r\nThe fertile lowland in the east and southeast is one of the most\r\nproductive regions in the world, and forms the chief resource of the\r\ncountry; on account of its productivity it is densely peopled. The arid\r\nand mountain lands are peopled mainly by cattle-herders and nomadic\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nChina is essentially an agricultural country, and the farms are held in\r\nmuch the same way as in the United States, but the holdings are so small\r\nthat agricultural machinery is not required for their cultivation.\r\n\r\nWheat, millet, and pease are grown throughout the lowlands wherever they\r\ncan be cultivated. The cultivation of rice is confined mainly to the\r\ncoast lowlands. The amount of food-stuffs produced, however, is scarcely\r\nsufficient for home consumption; indeed, a considerable amount is\r\nimported, and the imports year by year are increasing. This is due not\r\nso much to the density of population as to want of means of\r\ntransportation of the soil products from inland regions. It is often\r\nmuch cheaper to import food-stuffs from abroad than to transport them,\r\neven from an adjoining province.\r\n\r\nTea is extensively cultivated, and China exports nearly one-half of the\r\nworld\'s product; the total amount produced is considerably more than\r\nhalf. Most of this goes to Great Britain and Canada. Raw silk is an\r\nimportant product, and the mulberry-tree is extensively grown. Cotton is\r\none of the most general crops in the southern part of the empire,\r\nespecially along the lower Yangtze. It is a garden-crop, however, and\r\nnearly all of it is consumed.\r\n\r\nThe mineral wealth is very great, and with proper management will make\r\nChina one of the most productive and powerful countries in the world.\r\nCoal is found in every one of the provinces, and the city of Peking is\r\nsupplied with an excellent quality of anthracite from the Fang-shan\r\nmines, only a few miles distant. It is thought that the coal-fields are\r\nthe most extensive in the world. Iron ore of excellent quality is\r\nabundant, and in several localities, notably in the province of Shansi,\r\nthe two are near each other.\r\n\r\nForeign capitalists are seeking to develop these resources in several\r\nlocalities. The Germans have obtained mining concessions in Shantung\r\npeninsula, and these involve the iron ore and coal occurring there. The\r\nPeking syndicate, a London company, has also obtained a coal-mining\r\nconcession in Shansi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EASTERN CHINA]\r\n\r\nFor the greater part the manufactures are home industries.[79] Until\r\nrecently most of the cotton cloth was made by means of cottage looms,\r\nand the beautiful silk brocades which are not surpassed anywhere else in\r\nthe world are still made in this manner. Porcelain-making is one of the\r\noldest industries, and to this day the wares sold in Europe and America\r\nare known as "china." Straw carpet, or matting, and fans for export are\r\nalso important exports.\r\n\r\nThe mill system of manufacture is rapidly gaining ground, however, and\r\nforeign companies find it economical to carry the yarn made in India\r\nfrom American cotton into China to be made into cloth. In the vicinity\r\nof Shanghai alone there are nearly three hundred thousand spindles. This\r\nphase of the industry is due largely to the factor of cheap labor; the\r\nChinese skilled laborer is intelligent; he does not object to a\r\nsixteen-hour working-day at wages varying from five to twenty cents.\r\n\r\nThere is no great localization of industrial centres, as in the United\r\nStates and Europe. Each centre of population is practically\r\nself-supporting and independent from an economic stand-point. The\r\nintroduction of western methods, however, is gradually changing this\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\nAll industries of a general character are hampered for want of good\r\nmeans of transportation. The empire is traversed by a network of unpaved\r\nroads; but although these are always in a wretched condition, an\r\nenormous traffic is carried over them by means of wheel-barrows,\r\npack-animals, and by equally primitive methods.\r\n\r\nThe numerous rivers form an important means of communication. The\r\nYangtze is now available to commerce a distance of 2,000 miles, and the\r\nopening of the Si Kiang (West River) adds a large area that is\r\ncommercially tributary to Canton and Hongkong. The most important\r\nwater-way is the Grand Canal, extending from Hang Chow to Tientsin. This\r\ncanal is by no means a good one as compared with American and European\r\nstandards. It was built not so much for the necessities of traffic, as\r\nto avoid the numerous pirate vessels that infest the coasts. Junks,\r\nrow-boats, house-boats, and foreign steam craft are all employed for\r\ntraffic. The internal water-ways aggregate about fifteen thousand miles\r\nin length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TEA-PLANTATION--PICKING THE LEAVES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING THE LEAVES FOR ROASTING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEA-BALES FOR EXPORT THROUGH RUSSIA]\r\n\r\nOf railways there were less than three hundred and fifty miles at the\r\nclose of the century, the most important being the line from Tientsin to\r\nPeking. About five thousand miles are projected and under construction\r\nby American and European companies. A branch of the Transsiberian\r\nrailway is under construction to Port Arthur. Telegraph and telephone\r\nlines have become popular and have been extended to the interior a\r\nconsiderable distance. There are upward of twenty thousand miles of wire\r\ncommunication, the most important, in many respects, being a direct\r\noverland line between Peking and European cities. Inasmuch as there are\r\nno letters in the Chinese language, the difficulties in using the Morse\r\ncode of telegraphy are very great. In some cases the messages are\r\ntranslated into a foreign language before they are transmitted; in\r\nothers, a thousand or more words in colloquial and commercial use are\r\nnumbered, and the number is telegraphed instead of the word.\r\n\r\nMost of the business between the natives and foreigners is carried on by\r\nmeans of middlemen, or "compradors," and these include both the\r\ncommission merchants and the native bankers. They are intelligent,\r\nthrifty, and trustworthy. They are the most capable merchants in Asia,\r\nand have few if any superiors among the merchants of western nations. A\r\nvery large part of the retail trade of the Philippine Islands is carried\r\non by Chinese merchants.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Empire consists of China and the five dependencies, as shown\r\nin the following table:\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-------------+-------------\r\n                       |             | CAPITAL OR\r\n          STATE        | POPULATION  | CHIEF TOWN\r\n  ---------------------+-------------+-------------\r\n  China proper         | 380,000,000 | Peking\r\n  Manchuria            |   7,500,000 | Kirin\r\n  Tibet                |   6,000,000 | Lassa\r\n  Mongolia             |   2,000,000 | Urga\r\n  Jungaria             |     600,000 | Kur-kara-usu\r\n  Eastern Turkestan    |     600,000 | Yarkand\r\n  ---------------------+-------------+--------------\r\n\r\nThe five dependencies are mainly arid, unproductive, and sparsely\r\npeopled. Their chief importance consists in the fact that they are\r\n"buffer states" between China proper and European states. They produce\r\nlittle except meat, wool, and live-stock.\r\n\r\nChina proper is divided into provinces, each governed by a viceroy\r\nappointed by the throne. All business with foreign powers is transacted\r\nthrough a Foreign Office, the Wai-wu-pu (formerly the Tsung-li-Yamen).\r\nThe government business is managed by a Grand Council whose members are\r\nadvisers to the throne. The government is controlled mainly by Manchu\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HONGKONG]\r\n\r\nUntil within a few years China nominally allowed no foreign traders\r\nwithin her borders; recently, however, about forty cities, commonly\r\nknown as "treaty ports," have been opened to the trade of foreign\r\ncountries. Goods going inland any distance are required to pay a "liken"\r\nor internal tariff at the border of each province.\r\n\r\nSeveral concessions of territory within recent years have been forced\r\nfrom China by foreign powers: thus, Great Britain has Hongkong Island\r\n(with the peninsula of Kaulung) and Weihaiwei; Germany has Kiaochou on\r\nthe bay of the same name; France has Kwang chau wan harbor. These\r\nconcessions carry with them the control of the port and surrounding\r\nterritory. The German concession includes the right to mine coal and\r\niron, and to build railways within a territory of much larger extent. At\r\nthe close of the war between Russia and Japan, the latter acquired Port\r\nArthur, the gateway to Manchuria.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the political significance of the opening of the treaty\r\nports and the granting of the various concessions, the effect has been\r\nto increase the trade of the United States with China about twenty-fold.\r\nThe imports from the United States consist mainly of cotton and cotton\r\ncloth, coal-oil, and flour. The chief exports to all countries are tea,\r\nsilk goods, and porcelain ware. Most of those sent to the United States\r\nare landed at Seattle or San Francisco. Great Britain, through the port\r\nof Hongkong, has a larger trade than any other nation. Japan and the\r\nUnited States have most of the remaining trade.\r\n\r\n_Peking_, the capital, is politically, but not commercially, important.\r\nThe part occupied by the foreign legations is modern and well kept.\r\n_Tientsin_, the port of Peking, is a larger city, with much more\r\nbusiness. _Canton_, the largest city of the empire, and _Hongkong_, are\r\nthe commercial centres of nearly all the British trade. Most of the\r\nAmerican and Japanese trade centres at _Shanghai_. _Niuchwang_, on the\r\nManchurian frontier, is important mainly as a strategic point. _Macao_,\r\na Portuguese possession, is the open door of Portugal into China.\r\n\r\nThe inland divisions of the Chinese Empire have but little commercial\r\nimportance. Musk, wool, and skins are obtained from Tibet, into whose\r\ncapital, _Lassa_, scarcely half-a-dozen Europeans have penetrated. The\r\nclosed condition is due to the opposition of the Lamas, an order of\r\nBuddhist priests. Mongolia is a grazing region that supplies the Chinese\r\nborder country with goats, sheep, and horses. It also supplies the\r\ncamels required for the caravan tea-trade to the Russian frontiers.\r\nEastern Turkestan is mainly a desert. _Kashgar_, the metropolis of the\r\nfertile portion, is the exchange market for Chinese and Russian\r\nproducts. Most of the mineral known as jade is obtained there. Manchuria\r\nis a grazing and wheat-growing country, exporting food stuffs and\r\nginseng into China. _Harbin_, a Russian trading post, is connected with\r\nPeking and with European cities by railway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPAN AND KOREA]\r\n\r\n=Korea=, formerly a vassal of China, became an independent state after the\r\nwar between China and Japan, this step being forced by Russia. The\r\ncountry is a natural market for Japanese manufactures, and in turn\r\nsupplies Japan with a considerable amount of food-stuffs. _Chemulpo_ is\r\nthe chief centre of its commerce.\r\n\r\n=Japan.=--Japan is an insular empire, the commercial part of which has\r\nabout the same latitude as the Atlantic coast of the United States; the\r\nempire extends from Formosa to Kamchatka. It is sometimes called the\r\n"Great Britain of the East," and the people are also called the "Yankees\r\nof the East." Structurally, the chain of islands consists of ranges of\r\nvolcanic mountains. The abundant rains, however, have made many fertile\r\nriver-valleys, and have fringed most of the islands with coast-plains.\r\n\r\nSince the opening of Japan to foreigners the Japanese have so thoroughly\r\nadapted themselves to western commercial methods that they have become\r\nthe dominating power in eastern Asia. Their influence has been greatly\r\nstrengthened by a treaty for defensive purposes with Great Britain. A\r\nmost excellent army and a modern navy make the alliance a strong one.\r\nThe Japanese are better adapted to mould the commercial policy of China\r\nthan any other people.\r\n\r\nWith a population of more than half that of the United States, occupying\r\nan area not larger than the State of California, every square foot of\r\navailable land must be cultivated. Yet the Japanese not only grow most\r\nof the food-stuffs they consume, but are able to export rice. There is\r\nscant facility for growing beef cattle, but fish very largely takes the\r\nplace of beef. The cattle grown are used as draught-animals in farm\r\nlabor. Ordinary dairy products are but little used.\r\n\r\nRice, tea, and silk are the staple crops. Rice is grown on the coast\r\nlowlands, the west or rainy side[80] producing the larger crop. The\r\nJapanese crop is so superior that the larger part is exported, while an\r\ninferior Chinese grain is imported for home consumption. The quality of\r\nthe Japanese rice is due to skilful cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE PLOUGHING RICE-FIELDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRRIGATING A RICE-FIELD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICE-FIELDS]\r\n\r\nTea has become the staple crop, and is cultivated from Formosa to the\r\nforty-fifth parallel. Tea-farms occupy nearly every acre of the\r\ncultivable hill-side areas in some of the islands, and the soil is\r\nenriched with a fertilizer made from fish and fish refuse, dried and\r\nbroken. Most of the tea product is made into green tea, and on account\r\nof its quality it commands a high price. Formosa tea is considered the\r\nbest in the market.\r\n\r\nSilk culture is confined almost wholly to the island of Hondo. The raw\r\nsilk is of superior quality, and the exported material is used mainly in\r\nthe manufacture of ribbons and brocades. A limited amount of cotton is\r\ngrown, but the staple is short, and its cultivation is not profitable\r\nexcept in a few localities.\r\n\r\nAmong the forestry there is comparatively little timber suitable for\r\nbuilding purposes, and a considerable amount of timber is purchased from\r\nthe mills of Puget Sound. Bamboo is largely employed for buildings.\r\nCamphor is the product of a tree (_Camphora officinarum_) allied to the\r\ncinnamon and the sassafras. It is cultivated in the island of Kiushiu.\r\nThe best gum, however, is now obtained from Formosa, and this island now\r\ncontrols the world\'s supply. The camphor product is a government\r\nmonopoly leased to a British company.\r\n\r\nThe lacquer-tree (_Rhus vernicifera_) grows mainly in the island of\r\nHondo. The sap, after preparation, forms the most durable varnish known.\r\nBlack lacquer is obtained by treating the sap with nutgalls. Lacquered\r\nwooden-ware is sold all over Europe and the United States. The lacquered\r\nsurface is exceedingly hard and water-proof; it is not affected by\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nGold, porcelain clay, silver, copper, and petroleum are mined. The gold\r\nand silver are used both for coinage and in the arts; the clay has made\r\nJapanese porcelains famous. The copper comes from the most productive\r\nmines of Asia; a considerable amount is exported, but much is used in\r\nthe manufacture of Japanese bronze goods. Coal is mined, and this has\r\ngiven a great impetus to manufacture; iron ore is deficient, and steel\r\nmust be imported. The quantity of petroleum is increasing yearly, and is\r\nbecoming an important factor in the world\'s product.\r\n\r\nManufacturing industries are giving shape to the industrial future of\r\nthe country. The cotton-mills alone employ seventy thousand people and\r\nkeep more than one million spindles busy. More than one million\r\noperatives are engaged in textile manufactures. Much of the cloth, both\r\ncotton and silk, is still woven on cottage looms. The cotton cloth is\r\nsold mainly in China and Korea; the surplus silk textiles find a ready\r\nmarket in the United States. The best straw matting used as a\r\nfloor-covering is now made in Japan and constitutes a very important\r\nexport.\r\n\r\nThree thousand miles of railway aid the internal industries of the\r\ncountry; several steamship lines to Hongkong and Shanghai, and one or\r\nmore each to Vladivostok, Bombay, San Francisco, Seattle, Honolulu,\r\nAustralia, and Vancouver (B.C.) carry the tea, raw silk, and\r\nmanufactured products to Europe and America. Much, if not most, of the\r\nsteamship interests are owned by the Japanese, and the lines are\r\nencouraged by government subsidies. France and the United States buy\r\nmost of the raw silk. The latter country purchases most of the tea,\r\nsending coal-oil, cotton, leather, and lumber in return. Great Britain\r\nand Germany sell to the Japanese a large part of the textiles and the\r\nmachinery they use. The exports to the United States are consigned\r\nmainly to San Francisco, New York and Seattle.\r\n\r\n_Tokio_ is the capital; _Yokohama_ is the chief port for American\r\ntraffic, and the market for most of the foreign trade. Most of the trade\r\nbetween China and Japan centres at _Nagasaki_, which is the Japanese\r\nnaval station. _Osaka_ and _Kioto_ are the chief centres of cotton and\r\ntextile manufactures.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nHow has the policy of seclusion affected the commercial development of\r\nChina?\r\n\r\nWhat has been its effect on the social life of the people?\r\n\r\nHow did the cultivation of opium in India become a factor in the opening\r\nof China to foreign trade?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by "treaty ports"? Make a list of those shown on the map\r\nof eastern China.\r\n\r\nName two Chinese statesmen who have been factors in the relations\r\nbetween China and the United States.\r\n\r\nCompare the position of Japan with that of the British Isles with\r\nreference to commerce.\r\n\r\nWhat advantages has Japan with reference to latitude?--what\r\ndisadvantages with reference to cultivable lands?\r\n\r\nFrom the Statesman\'s Year-Book find the leading exports and imports and\r\nthe volume of trade of these states.\r\n\r\nFrom the Abstract of Statistics find the leading articles of trade\r\nbetween these states and the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nFrom a cyclop\xc3\xa6dia read the following topics: The opium war, Commodore\r\nPerry\'s expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nAFRICA\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrica is in a state of commercial transition. During the last quarter\r\nof the nineteenth century the partition of its area among European\r\nnations left but few of the names that formerly were familiar. At the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century the British, French, and Germans\r\ncontrolled the greater part of the continent, although the Portuguese,\r\nBelgians, Italians, and Spanish have various possessions.\r\n\r\nThe partition of Africa was designed for the expansion of European\r\nmarkets. The population of Africa is about one hundred and seventy\r\nmillion, and the continent is practically without manufacturing\r\nenterprises. The people, therefore, must be supplied with clothing and\r\nother commodities. In 1900 the total trade of Africa with the rest of\r\nthe world was about one and one-third billion dollars, of which the\r\nUnited States had a little more than two per cent., mainly cotton cloth\r\nand coal-oil.\r\n\r\n=Egypt.=--The Egypt of the maps is a region of indefinite extent so far as\r\nits western and southern boundaries are concerned; the Egypt of history\r\nis the flood plain of the Nile. From the Mediterranean Sea to Cairo the\r\ncultivable area is not far from one hundred miles in width; from Cairo\r\nto Khartum it varies from three to seven or eight miles wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFRICA]\r\n\r\nThe food-producing power of Egypt depends on the Nile. In lower Egypt a\r\nconsiderable area is made productive at the ordinary stage of water by\r\nmeans of irrigating canals, but in upper Egypt the crops must depend\r\nupon the annual flood of the river, which occurs from June until\r\nSeptember. During this period the river varies from twenty-five to forty\r\nfeet above the low-water mark. In the irrigated regions three crops a\r\nyear may be produced; in the flooded lands only one is grown.\r\n\r\nIn order to add to the cultivable area two great engineering works have\r\nbeen constructed. A barrage and lock control the flow of water at\r\nAssiut; a huge dam at Assuan impounds the surplus of the flood season.\r\nThese structures, it is thought, will increase the productive power of\r\nthe country about one-fourth. Rice, maize (an Egyptian variety), sugar,\r\nwheat, and beans are the staple crops.\r\n\r\nRice is the food of the native people, but the crop is insufficient, and\r\nthe deficit must be imported. The wheat, maize, and beans are grown for\r\nexport to Europe, the last named being extensively used for\r\nhorse-fodder. The sugar-growing industry is protected by the heavy yield\r\nand the cheap fellahin labor. The raw sugar is sent to the refineries\r\nalong the Mediterranean. Onions are exported to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe cotton-crop is an important factor, and in spite of its own crop the\r\nUnited States is a heavy purchaser of the long-staple Egyptian cotton,\r\nwhich is used in the manufacture of thread and hosiery. The cultivation\r\nof tobacco is forbidden by law, but Egyptian cigarettes are an item of\r\nconsiderable importance. They are made of imported Turkish tobacco by\r\nforeign workmen. There is a heavy export duty on native tobacco\r\nexported, and the ban on the inferior native-grown article is intended\r\nto prevent its admixture with the high-grade product from Turkey, and\r\nthereby to keep up the standard of the cigarettes.\r\n\r\nEgypt is nominally a vassal of Turkey, paying to the Sultan a yearly\r\ntribute of $3,600,000. Great Britain\'s is the real controlling hand,\r\nbecause the Suez Canal is Great Britain\'s gateway to India. By a\r\npurchase of the stock held by a former Khedive, Great Britain secured\r\nfinancial control of the canal, a necessary step from the fact that more\r\nthan half the trade carried through the canal is British commerce.\r\n\r\nThe country is deficient in the resources that make most nations\r\npowerful. There is neither coal, iron, nor timber available, and these\r\nmust be imported. Great Britain supplies the first, and Norway the last.\r\nSome traffic is carried on the Nile, but railways have been built\r\nthrough the crop-lands. One of these threads the Nile Valley and will\r\nbecome a part of the "Cape to Cairo" route.\r\n\r\n_Alexandria_ is the port at which most of the Egyptian commerce lands.\r\n_Cairo_, the largest city of Africa, derives its importance from its\r\nposition at the head of the Nile delta. It is a favorite winter-resort.\r\n_Port Sa\xc3\xafd_ and _Suez_ are the terminal ports of the Suez Canal; their\r\ncommerce is mainly the transit trade of the canal.\r\n\r\n=Other Independent States.=--Most of the independent states of Africa are\r\nin a condition of barbarism and have but little importance to the rest\r\nof the world. Abyssinia has the natural advantages of gold, iron,\r\npasture-lands, and forestry, and the possibilities of cotton\r\ncultivation. Valuable mining concessions have been granted to foreign\r\ncompanies. Ivory, coffee, and gold are shipped to India in exchange for\r\ntextiles. A railway from the coast is under construction, but all the\r\ntraffic is carried by mule-trains, mainly to _Harrar_.\r\n\r\nMorocco has an admirable strategic position at the entrance of the\r\nStrait of Gibraltar, and is most likely, in time, to become a possession\r\nof Spain. There are exported, mainly to Great Britain, beans, almonds,\r\ngoat-skins, and wool. The goat-skins are sumac-tanned and are still\r\nused in making the best book-binding leather. Only a small part of the\r\nso-called Morocco leather of commerce is genuine. There are no railways;\r\ncaravan routes from the Sahara cross the country. _Tangier_ and one or\r\ntwo other ports are open to foreign trade. Coal-oil is the only import\r\nfrom the United States.\r\n\r\nThe state of Liberia was established for the benefit of freed slaves\r\nfrom the United States. The products are those of tropical Africa,\r\nincluding caoutchouc. Coffee cultivation is extensively carried on, and\r\ncoffee is the leading export. _Monrovia_ is the chief centre of trade.\r\n\r\n=North African Possessions.=--French influence is paramount in northern\r\nAfrica. Algeria and Tunis are both French colonies, and the caravan\r\ntrade of the Sahara is generally tributary to French trade. The region\r\nknown as the Tell, a strip between the coast and the Atlas Mountains, is\r\nthe chief agricultural region, and the products are similar to those on\r\nthe other side of the Mediterranean Sea. The ordinary grains are grown\r\nfor home consumption, but the macaroni wheat crop is manufactured into\r\nmacaroni paste for export. The fruit-crop, especially the olive, date,\r\nand grape, and their products, is exported.\r\n\r\nEsparto grass, for making paper, was formerly an important export, but\r\nthe increasing use of wood-pulp for this purpose has had the effect of\r\nincreasing the grazing area, and therefore the wool-crop. Date-palms\r\ngrow in great profusion, and the excess forms an important export, going\r\nto nearly every part of Europe and the United States. A large part of\r\nthe crop, however, is consumed by the Arabs. Sumac-tanned goat-skins,\r\nfor book-binding leather, are also exported.\r\n\r\nThe colonies must import coal. Manufactures are therefore restricted to\r\nthe preparation of the fruit and food products. Sponges are an\r\nimportant product. Railways provide the necessary transportation for the\r\ncrops. _Algiers_, the metropolis, is a finely built city and a favorite\r\nwinter-resort. _Oran_ is the shipping-port for grain and esparto grass.\r\n_Biskra_ is the market for dates.\r\n\r\nThe caravan trade of northern Africa is considerable, and the greater\r\npart converges at _Tripoli_, to which not far from ten thousand\r\ncamel-loads of merchandise are brought annually. This trade is carried\r\non mainly by the Arabs, who cover the region from _Timbuctu_ to Lake\r\nChad. They bring ivory, ostrich feathers, gold, goat-skins, and slaves.\r\nIn return they carry cloth, fire-arms, ammunition, and various\r\ncommodities to the negro villages of the Sudan. The district is a\r\npossession of Turkey. Its chief exports are esparto grass, sponges, and\r\ndye-stuffs.\r\n\r\n=Central Africa.=--Central Africa is divided among the chief European\r\npowers. Great Britain and Germany divide the lake-region and the\r\nZanzibar coast. On the Guinea coast the French are an additional factor.\r\nThe trade of these regions consists of an exchange of tropical\r\nproducts--palm-oil, rubber, ebony, camwood, ivory, and hides--for cloth,\r\ntobacco, fire-arms, beads and trinkets, and preserved foods. Most of\r\nthis trade is carried on by companies holding royal charters.\r\n\r\nThe Kongo State is a semi-official corporation of this character, the\r\nKing of the Belgians being its chief executive officer. The active\r\nadministration is carried on by agents of the company. The chief of each\r\ntribe or village is required, under penalty, to furnish a certain quota\r\nof crude rubber and other products; and between the agent and the Arab\r\nslave-driver the natives have little to choose.\r\n\r\nThe Kongo River is the outlet of the state, and to facilitate the\r\ntransportation of the products, railways have been built, or are under\r\nconstruction, around the rapids. This region is about the only\r\nremaining source of elephant ivory, but most of the supply consists of\r\nthe tusks of animals long since dead. A fleet of steamboats carries the\r\ncommercial products to the coast. _Stanley Pool_, at the head of the\r\nrapids, is the chief depot for collection. Ocean steamships ascend the\r\nriver to a point above _Boma_, the place of administration.\r\n\r\nNigeria and Ashanti are British possessions on the Guinea coast,[81]\r\nhaving a trading company organization. Sierra Leone is an organized\r\ncolony, a product of which is the kola-nut. British East Africa is\r\nimportant for strategic purposes, inasmuch as it includes the upper Nile\r\nbasin, a territory sometimes known as the Egyptian Sudan. _Akra_ is the\r\ntrading port of Nigeria, and _Khartum_ of the upper Nile Valley.\r\n_Zanzibar_ is the metropolis of the east coast.\r\n\r\nThe French possessions include a large territory at the mouth of the\r\nKongo, the western part of the Sahara, and the islands of Madagascar and\r\nReunion. In German East Africa the commercial development has been\r\nsubstantial, and large plantations for the cultivation of tropical\r\nproducts are in operation. A railway from the coast to the lake-district\r\nis under construction. _Mombasa_ is its commercial outlet.\r\n\r\nThe Italians have nominal possession of a territory facing the Strait of\r\nBab-el-Mandeb, and also of the peninsula of Guardafui. Their actual\r\npossession, however, is restricted to the island and trading-post of\r\n_Massawa_. Their attempts to conquer Abyssinia have been unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n=Cape of Good Hope and the South African Colonies.=--Up to the time of the\r\nSuez Canal, Cape of Good Hope was a sort of half-way house between\r\nBritish ports and India, and this position made it commercially\r\nimportant. Even at the present time more than fifteen hundred vessels,\r\nmany of them in the Indian Ocean trade, call at the chief port of the\r\ncolony every year.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is the chief industry of these colonies, though not the one\r\nyielding the greatest returns. Enough wheat, maize (or "mealies"), and\r\nfruit are grown for home consumption, but the climate is too arid for\r\nany excess of bread-stuffs. The aridity is a resource, however, in the\r\nmatter of wool, the superior quality of which is due largely to the\r\ndeficient rainfall. As a matter of fact the whole country is a great\r\ngrazing veldt; wool, a very fine quality of Angora mohair, hides, and\r\ncattle products are exports.\r\n\r\nFrom December to March the fruits ripen, and these, especially the\r\ngrapes, are carried in cold-storage vessels to British and other\r\nEuropean ports. The wine is likewise of excellent quality and is\r\nbecoming an export of great value. Both the fruit and the wine are\r\nsimilar to those of Australia and California.\r\n\r\nThe business of ostrich farming is in the hands of several large\r\ncompanies, and, next to the wool-crop, ostrich plumes are the leading\r\nproduct. There are about a quarter of a million birds, and each produces\r\nabout one pound of feathers. The ordinary quality of plumes varies from\r\nfive to ten dollars a pound; very choice plumes command as much as two\r\nhundred dollars a pound. London is the chief market for them, but most\r\nof them sooner or later find their way to the milliners of the great\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nThe diamond-mines of Griqualand West furnish practically the whole of\r\nthe world\'s supply. The mines are operated on a most thorough business\r\nsystem, and the output of rough stones is carefully regulated to meet\r\nthe demand. All wholesale dealers know the output from year to year, and\r\nno more stones are put upon the market than the number required to meet\r\nthe demand. All the Kimberley mines are now consolidated under one\r\ncompany. The yearly output does not vary much from twenty million\r\ndollars\' worth of stones. The stones are marketed from Kimberley, but\r\nLondon dealers buy most of them.\r\n\r\nThe mines that for several years produced more gold than any others in\r\nexistence are in the Transvaal.[82] Other undeveloped mines in the\r\nterritory of Rhodesia are known to be extremely rich in precious metals;\r\nindeed, there is much evidence that the famous mines of Ophir were in\r\nthis region. Copper ore is an important export.\r\n\r\nThe industries of Natal colony do not differ materially from those of\r\nCape of Good Hope. The rainfall is sufficient for the growing of\r\nsugar-cane, and sugar is an important export to the mother-country. The\r\ncolony has productive coal-mines, and these are destined to become an\r\nimportant resource.\r\n\r\nThe home government has encouraged railway building, and a trunk line\r\nthrough Rhodesia affords an outlet to the ports of the south coast. It\r\nis the policy of the mother-country to extend this road along the\r\nlake-region and the Nile Valley (known as the "Great Rift") to the\r\nMediterranean Sea. This plan when carried out will give Great Britain a\r\npractical control of the trade of eastern Africa. The imports are mainly\r\ntextiles, machinery, and steel wares.\r\n\r\n_Cape Town_ is the most important centre of trade in South Africa. A\r\nconsiderable trade, however, is carried on at _Port Elizabeth_ and at\r\n_Durban_, the port of Natal. _Kimberley_ is the seat of the\r\ndiamond-mining interests, and _Johannesberg_ of the gold-mines.\r\n\r\nGermany and Portugal divide the southwest coast. _Walfisch Bay_ is the\r\noutlet of the former. Portuguese East Africa is an outlet for the trade\r\nof the Transvaal region, with which it is connected by rail. The port\r\n_Louren\xc3\xa7o Marquez_ has a fine harbor.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nHas the partition of Africa been an advantage or a disadvantage to the\r\nnative races of the continent?\r\n\r\nWhat advantages will accrue to Great Britain from the Cape to Cairo\r\nrailway?\r\n\r\nCompare the basin of the Kongo with that of the Amazon with respect to\r\nclimate, products, and civilization.\r\n\r\nFrom Commercial Africa prepare a list of the exports and imports between\r\nthe United States and the various African countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND REFERENCE\r\n\r\nStatesman\'s Year-Book.\r\n\r\nCommercial Africa--pp. 3679 and following.\r\n\r\nFrom a cyclop\xc3\xa6dia read the following topics: Ivory, Suez Canal,\r\nGibraltar, Livingstone, Diamonds, Canary Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nOCEANIA\r\n\r\n\r\nOceania, the island division of the world, includes Australasia and the\r\ngreat groups of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Some of the larger islands\r\nare regions of great productivity; others are important as\r\ncoaling-stations; still others have positions of great strategic value.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered that more than half the people in the world live\r\non the slopes of the Pacific Ocean, and that they depend on the\r\nmetal-working and manufacturing people of the Atlantic slopes for\r\nclothing and commodities, it is apparent that the commerce of the\r\nPacific Ocean must reach enormous proportions.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the various island groups of Oceania have been acquired\r\nby Europeans, and from the moment of their occupation their commercial\r\ndevelopment began. The great majority of these groups are within the\r\nlimits of the sago-palm, bread-fruit, cocoanut, and banana, and these\r\nyield not only the food-stuffs of the native people, but the export\r\nproducts as well. Copra, or dried cocoanut meat, is the general export.\r\nIt is marketed in Marseille, London, and San Francisco. Sago is prepared\r\nfrom the pith of a species of palm. Considerable quantities are also\r\nexported, and it is used as a table delicacy. The banana is the\r\nfood-stuff upon which many millions of people must depend. In spite of\r\ntheir small aggregate area, the food-producing power of these islands is\r\nvery great.[83]\r\n\r\nOn account of its central position, Honolulu, the capital and chief\r\nport of Hawaii, is the most important mid-ocean station of the Pacific.\r\nIt is almost in the direct line of traffic between the Pacific ports of\r\nthe United States and Canada on the one hand, and those of Australia,\r\nJapan and China on the other. It is also in the route of vessels that\r\nmay hereafter use the American isthmian canal in going between European\r\nand Asian ports.\r\n\r\nIn the cultivation of export products native Malay labor is almost\r\nalways employed, inasmuch as Europeans cannot bear out-of-door labor in\r\nthe tropics. The natives are generally known as "Kanakas," and there is\r\nnot a little illicit traffic in their labor. Chinese and Japanese\r\ncoolies are also employed as laborers.\r\n\r\n=The Commonwealth of Australia.=--The commonwealth of Australia consists\r\nof the various states of Australia together with Tasmania. Their\r\nposition corresponds very closely to that of Mexico and Central America,\r\nand the climate and products are not unlike. A considerable part of\r\nAustralia is a desert, and a large area is too arid for the production\r\nof bread-stuffs; the eastern coast, however, receives abundant rains.\r\n\r\nAustralia produces nearly one-third of the wool-clip of the world. On\r\naccount of the climate, the quality of the wool, much of it merino, is\r\nexcellent. More than half the clip comes from New South Wales.\r\nTwo-thirds of the wool goes to Great Britain to be manufactured; nearly\r\nall the rest is purchased by France, Germany, and Belgium. Less than two\r\nper cent. is sold to the United States.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of cold-storage plants in steamships, Australia\r\nhas become a heavy exporter of meat. Areas long unproductive are now\r\ncattle-ranges; mutton constitutes the heaviest shipment. Inasmuch as the\r\ntransportation is almost wholly by water, the cost is very light, and\r\nthe mutton can be sold to London dealers at less than four cents per\r\npound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COMMERCE OF THE PACIFIC]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUSTRALIA]\r\n\r\nWheat is grown mainly for home consumption. Grapes for wine and for\r\nraisins are good-paying crops in Victoria and New South Wales. Both\r\nproducts find a ready market in Great Britain. Australian claret is a\r\nstrong competitor of California claret for public favor, and the two are\r\nsimilar in character. Cane-sugar is grown in the moist regions of\r\nQueensland; it is the chief supply of the commonwealth and the\r\nneighboring islands. The forests produce an abundance of hard woods, but\r\npractically no building-timber. Jarrah wood paving-blocks are an\r\nimportant export. British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon supply much\r\nof the building-timber.\r\n\r\nGold has been the chief mineral product since the settlement of the\r\ncountry. The mints convert the metal into coin. As a rule the value of\r\nthe exports exceeds that of the imports, and the excess swells the\r\namount of metal exported. The most productive mines are in the district\r\nof Ballarat. Coal is abundant on the east coast, and a considerable part\r\nis sold to California, and more to Asian ports. Tin is extensively mined\r\nin Tasmania.\r\n\r\nMore than fifteen thousand miles of railway have been built to carry the\r\ntraffic of the country. Most of them were built by private corporations,\r\nbut on account of financial difficulties and poor service they were\r\nacquired by the government. The policy proved a wise one.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain encourages the trade of her colonies, and gets about\r\nthree-fourths of the traffic of the commonwealth, the imports being\r\nmanufactured goods. Of the foreign trade the United States has about\r\nhalf, nearly all of which is landed at San Francisco and Puget\r\nSound. Wool, cattle products, and coal are exported to the United\r\nStates, and the latter sends to Australia structural steel--mainly\r\nrails--printing-paper, and coal-oil.\r\n\r\n_Melbourne_ is the largest city. _Sydney_ is the port at which most of\r\nthe ocean trade is landed. _Brisbane_, mainly a coal and a wool market,\r\nis connected with British Columbia by an ocean cable. Steamships by way\r\nof the Suez Canal generally call at _Perth_ and _Adelaide_. _Hobart_ and\r\n_Launcestown_ are the markets of Tasmania.\r\n\r\n=New Zealand.=--This colony is one of the most prosperous and best\r\nadministered states in existence. The cultivable lands produce enough\r\nwheat for home use, and an excess for export. Cattle and sheep are the\r\nchief resource, however, and pretty nearly everything--meat, hides,\r\nwool, horn, and bones--is exported. Dairy products are not forgotten,\r\nand under the management of an association, these are of the best\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand flax (_Phormium tenax_), a kind of marsh hemp, yields a\r\nfibre used in making cordage. The kauri pine furnishes the chief supply\r\nof lumber. A fossil kauri gum is collected for export; it makes a\r\nvarnish almost equal to Japanese lacquer. Gold is mined, and there being\r\nno mint, all the bullion is exported. The only manufactures are those\r\nwhich are connected with the meat export and the dairy industry. The\r\nexports noted more than pay for the manufactured goods. Most of the\r\ntrade is carried on with Great Britain. _Wellington_, the capital, and\r\n_Auckland_ are the centres of trade.\r\n\r\n=New Guinea.=--This island, one of the largest in the world, is somewhat\r\nlarger than the State of Texas, or about one-third larger than Germany\r\nor France. The gold-mines first led to the exploration and settlement of\r\nthe island, but it was soon apparent that the agricultural resources\r\nwere even more valuable, and it was divided among the British, Germans,\r\nand Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe western part of the island is distinctly Asian in character; the\r\neastern and southern parts resemble Australia. Coffee, rice, and tobacco\r\nplantations have been established in the former; grazing is the chief\r\nindustry in the latter. Ebony and bamboo are among the forest products.\r\n\r\n=British Possessions.=--The Fiji Islands are among the most important\r\nBritish possessions. They number about eighty habitable and twice as\r\nmany small islands. Sugar is the chief export product, and it goes\r\nmainly to Australia and New Zealand. Cocoanuts are also a large item of\r\nexport trade. _Suva_ is the chief trading-port.\r\n\r\nThe Tonga Islands are nominally independent, but are practically a\r\nBritish protectorate. Among other British possessions are Cook, Gilbert,\r\nand Ellice archipelagoes, and Pitcairn Island.\r\n\r\n=German Possessions.=--The Samoa Islands are perhaps the most important\r\nGerman possession, and German planters have made them highly productive.\r\nThey were formerly held under a community-of-interest plan by Great\r\nBritain, Germany, and the United States. A joint commission awarded the\r\ngreater part of the territory to Germany. In addition to the ordinary\r\nproducts, pineapples and limes are exported. Most of the trade is\r\ncarried on by way of Australia. _Apia_ is the trading-port.\r\n\r\nBismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon, Marshall, and Caroline groups\r\nhave also been acquired by Germany. The last named was purchased from\r\nSpain at the close of the Spanish-American War.\r\n\r\n=French Possessions.=--New Caledonia, together with Loyalty Islands,\r\nFortuna, and the New Hebrides group, have great wealth in the matter of\r\nresources. New Caledonia, a penal colony, has productive mines of chrome\r\niron ore and copper. It is the source of a considerable supply of nickel\r\nand cobalt. A railway to the coast has been built for the carriage of\r\nthese products.\r\n\r\nTahiti is the principal island of the Society group, and under the\r\nmissions long established there, the natives have become civilized. In\r\naddition to the usual trade, sugar and mother-of-pearl are important\r\nexports.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nHow will the commerce of the Pacific be changed by the construction of\r\nan isthmian canal?\r\n\r\nWhat has been the effect of the Australian wool-clip on the cloth-making\r\nindustry of England and Germany?\r\n\r\nHow will the acquisition of Hawaii and the Philippine Islands affect the\r\ncommerce of the United States?\r\n\r\nFrom Commercial Australia find the trade of the United States with the\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR COLLATERAL READING AND

exhausted, these may be\r\npurchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Public Printer,\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\n[2] The greatness of Palmyra was due to the trade along this route, and\r\nits decay began when the route was abandoned. The present town of Tadmor\r\nis near the ruins of the former city.\r\n\r\n[3] Cosmas Indicopleustes--in early life a merchant, in later years a\r\nmonk--visited India and Ceylon during the first part of the sixth\r\ncentury. His writings contain much valuable knowledge, but in the main\r\nthey are theological arguments intended to disprove the Geography\r\nwritten by Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[4] The date is variously given as 1169, 1200, and 1241.\r\n\r\n[5] To Waldemar III. of Denmark it dictated terms that made its power in\r\nScandinavia supreme.\r\n\r\n[6] For a complete list of books for reference, see p. xii.\r\n\r\n[7] The record time on this route was made by the Lucania in five days,\r\nseven hours, and twenty-three minutes, from Daunts Rock, Queenstown, to\r\nSandy Hook light. The fastest day\'s run yet recorded was made by the\r\nDeutschland--601 nautical miles, a speed of 24.19 knots.\r\n\r\n[8] In Congress the River and Harbor Bill always receives a generous\r\nappropriation.\r\n\r\n[9] In many instances goods designed for the spring trade in the Western\r\nStates are started via the canal in October, reaching their destination\r\nat Chicago some time in April, the cargo having been frozen up in one or\r\nanother of the canal basins during the winter. The rate paid for this\r\nslow transit is considerably less than the amount which otherwise would\r\nhave been paid for storage; moreover, it is nearly all clear profit to\r\nthe canal boatmen.\r\n\r\n[10] The minimum depth of the canal is 22 feet; its width at the bottom\r\nis 160 feet. It was begun September, 1892, and completed January 2,\r\n1902, at a cost of thirty-four million dollars. More than forty million\r\ncubic yards of earth and rock were excavated. All the bridges crossing\r\nit are movable.\r\n\r\n[11] This is on the supposition that night travel will be too dangerous\r\na risk. With a continuous travel the time would be about thirty-three\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n[12] On one great trunk system the average ton-mile rate in 1870 was one\r\nand one-seventh cents; in 1900 it was just one-half that sum.\r\n\r\n[13] The modern steam-making boiler has from thirty to one hundred or\r\nmore tubes passing through it from end to end. The heat from the\r\nfire-box as a rule passes under the boiler and through the tubular\r\nflues; it thus increases the heating surface very greatly. The forced\r\ndraught is made by allowing the exhaust steam to escape into the\r\nsmokestack, thereby increasing the draught through the fire-box.\r\n\r\n[14] A single locomotive of the New York Central has hauled 4,000 tons\r\nof freight at a speed of twenty-five miles an hour. A "camel-back" of\r\nthe Philadelphia & Reading hauled 4,800 tons of coal from the mines to\r\ntide-water without a helper.\r\n\r\n[15] The Vanderbilt boiler with cylindrical corrugated fire-box invented\r\nby Cornelius Vanderbilt, great-grandson of the founder of the New York\r\nCentral, marks an important step in locomotive building. The cylindrical\r\nform largely obviates the necessity of an array of stay-bolts to prevent\r\nwarping; the corrugated surface gives greater heating power.\r\n\r\n[16] The Central-Atlantic type of locomotive illustrates a modern\r\nimprovement. The driving-wheels are placed a little forward of their\r\nusual position, while the fire-box, formerly set between the wheels, now\r\noverhangs each side of a pair of low trailing-wheels. By this means the\r\nheating surface of the fire-box is increased nearly one-half. A lever\r\ncontrolled by the engineer enables the latter to transfer 5,000 pounds\r\nweight from the trucks to the driving-wheels when a grade is to be\r\nsurmounted. The daily run of such a locomotive is greatly increased.\r\n(_See cut, p. 61._)\r\n\r\n[17] A line from Vienna to Triest was opened about 1854; Germany was\r\njoined to Italy across Brenner Pass in 1868; France was connected with\r\nItaly through a tunnel near Mont Cenis in 1871; in 1882 the traffic of\r\nGermany was opened to Mediterranean ports by a tunnel under St.\r\nGotthard. In this manner trunk systems have gradually developed.\r\n\r\n[18] The building of the West Shore Railroad is an illustration. After\r\nboth roads had suffered tremendous losses the New York Central settled\r\nthe matter by purchasing the West Shore. This was one of a great number\r\nof similar cases both in the United States and Europe.\r\n\r\n[19] In Great Britain the ton-rate is about $2.30 per hundred miles; in\r\nGermany, $1.75; in Russia, $1.30; in the United States, $0.70. The\r\ndifference is due as much to the length of distance hauled as to\r\neconomical management.\r\n\r\n[20] Thus, A, B, and C are roads whose chief terminal points are Chicago\r\nand New York City. The road C is the shortest of the three lines, but\r\nits grades are very heavy. B is, say, one hundred miles longer, but has\r\nno heavy grades. A is a very indirect route, and its New York traffic\r\nmust be trans-shipped at Boston, or perhaps at New London, and sent a\r\npart of the way by water. If now an absolute ton-mile rate is fixed for\r\neither road, it is evident that neither of the others can carry through\r\nfreight without altering rates. If C fixes a rate, then A and B must\r\neither charge higher rates between Chicago and Montreal, or Chicago and\r\nAlbany, than between their terminals. And although this is illegal in\r\nmost States, the laws are evaded by "rebate," or repayment of a certain\r\nsum to the shipper. Of the three roads B, on account of easy grades, is\r\nin the best position to fix rates. It therefore makes, not the lowest\r\nrate, but the one that will yield the best returns. C conforms to this,\r\nand A takes what it can get, hauling at a very small profit. But if A\r\nhappens to be outside of the limits of the United States, it may openly\r\ncut rates, because pretty nearly all the through freight it gets is\r\nclear profit, and inasmuch as none of the laws of a State apply to the\r\nCanadian portion of the road, it may do what the others cannot. And\r\nwhile B is struggling with A, the three roads X, Y, and Z are perhaps\r\nendeavoring to have some of the freight sent from Buffalo eastward over\r\ntheir own lines. In instances similar to the foregoing it is customary\r\nfor B and C to divide the through business and to allow a "differential"\r\nto A--that is, on account of its slower delivery of through freight, to\r\ncarry it at a slightly lower rate. B then adjusts its traffic with X, Y,\r\nand Z in a similar manner; and on the whole this is the fairest way to\r\nall concerned.\r\n\r\nThe following, one of many instances, shows the difficulties in fixing\r\nrates that will not be unjust to either party: Danville and Lynchburg\r\ncompete for a certain trade. The Southern Railway passes through both\r\ncities, but the Chesapeake & Ohio makes Lynchburg by another route;\r\nDanville, therefore, is not a competing point, while Lynchburg is. As a\r\nresult, the Southern Railway charged $1.08 for a certain traffic from\r\nChicago to Danville and only 72 cents to Lynchburg, some distance\r\nbeyond, this being the rate over the other road. The matter finally\r\nreached the Court of Appeals, and the latter sustained the Southern\r\nRailway. The rate to Danville was shown to be not excessive, but if the\r\nrailway were required to maintain a rate to Lynchburg higher than 72\r\ncents, it would lose all its traffic to that point, amounting to\r\n$433,000 yearly. In a case of this kind there can be no help except by a\r\nconsolidation of the two roads; by virtue of the consolidation all the\r\nLynchburg freight will then go over the line having the easiest haul.\r\n\r\n[21] That is, the Government pledged its credit for the money borrowed,\r\nand in addition gave the companies alternate sections of public land on\r\nboth sides of the proposed line, the land-grants being designed partly\r\nto encourage immigration and partly to increase the building funds of\r\nthe various companies. In several instances both the land-grants and the\r\nmoney subsidies were scandalously used. At least one road used its\r\nearnings to build a competing line and, after disposing of the\r\nland-grant and pocketing the proceeds, allowed the Government to\r\nforeclose the mortgage and sell the original road.\r\n\r\n[22] From the Latin "castra," a camp.\r\n\r\n[23] In 1897 the world\'s crop was 2,226,750,000 bushels, and as a\r\nresult, the countries in which the crop was short suffered from high\r\nprices. Had it not been for the prompt carrying service of railways and\r\nsteamships famine would have resulted.\r\n\r\n[24] In order to yield a crop of twenty-five bushels per acre the soil\r\nmust supply 110 lbs. of nitrogen, 45 lbs. of phosphoric acid, 30.5 lbs.\r\nof lime, 14.5 lbs. of magnesia, and 142 lbs. of potash; these are\r\napproximately the mineral elements taken out of the soil with each crop,\r\nand it is needless to say that they must be replaced or the grain will\r\nstarve for want of nutrient substances.\r\n\r\n[25] In the United States there are about seven wheat-districts, each\r\ncharacterized by particular varieties that grow best in the given\r\nlocality. In the New England and most of the middle Atlantic division\r\nEarly Genesee Giant, Jones Winter Fife, and Fultz are chiefly grown. In\r\nthe Southern States Fultz, Fulcaster, Purple Straw, and May are\r\nforemost. In the north central group of States Early Red Clawson, Poole,\r\nDawson\'s Golden Chaff, Buda Pest, and Fultz are common. In the Dakotas\r\nand Minnesota Scotch Fife and Velvet Blue Stem (both spring wheats) are\r\ngenerally planted. In Kansas and Texas and the adjacent locality the\r\nprincipal varieties are Turkey, Fulcaster, and Mediterranean (all winter\r\nwheats). In California and the southern plateau region Sonora,\r\nCalifornia Club, and Defiance are the principal kinds (all winter\r\nwheats). In Washington and Oregon Little Club, Red Chaff, and Blue Stem\r\n(which are either winter or spring) are the main varieties.\r\n\r\n[26] Sometimes the owner sends it to the nearest elevator at tide-water\r\nwhere the grain is stored, not in bulk, but in the original packages,\r\nsubject to his demand. In the course of a month or six weeks it absorbs\r\nso much moisture that the gain in weight more than pays the storage\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n[27] The elevators are equipped with "legs" or long spouts, within which\r\nbelts with metal scoops transfer the grain from car to vessel or _vice\r\nversa_. The elevators at Buffalo will fill a canal-boat in an hour\'s\r\ntime, or load six grain-cars in five minutes. A large whaleback\r\nsteamship may be relieved of its 200,000 bushels in about three hours.\r\nMost of the east-bound wheat of the Middle West is transferred to the\r\nseaboard by rail, but that of the northwest, which forms the chief part\r\nof the crop, is shipped from Duluth through the St. Marys Falls Canal to\r\nBuffalo, where it is transferred to cars or to canal-boats. New York is\r\nthe leading export market, but Boston, New Orleans, Galveston,\r\nBaltimore, and Philadelphia are also important shipping ports.\r\n\r\n[28] The following is approximately the yield of the chief wheat-growing\r\ncountries in bushels per acre:\r\n\r\n  Denmark                42\r\n  England                29\r\n  New Zealand            26\r\n  Germany                23.2\r\n  Holland & Belgium      21.5\r\n  Hungary                18.5\r\n  France                 19.5\r\n  Austria                16.3\r\n  Canada                 15.5\r\n  United States          12.3\r\n  Argentina              12.2\r\n  Italy                  12.1\r\n  Australia              10\r\n  India                   9.2\r\n  Russia                  8.6\r\n  Algeria                 7.5\r\n\r\nThe low average in Australia, India, and Algeria is due mainly to lack\r\nof rainfall; in the United States and Russia, mainly to unskilful\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n[29] It seems to have been introduced into Turkey from India about the\r\nlatter part of the fifteenth century, after which it was occasionally\r\nheard of in Europe as "Turkey corn."\r\n\r\n[30] The "tortilla," the national bread of the Mexican, consists of a\r\nthick corn-meal paste pressed into thin wafers between the hands, and\r\nbaked on hot slabs of stone. The corn-meal "mush" of the American, the\r\n"polenta" of the Italian, and the "mamaliga" of the Rumanian are all\r\npractically corn-meal boiled to a thick paste in water.\r\n\r\n[31] The gin, invented by Eli Whitney in 1793, enabled one man to do by\r\nmachinery about the same amount of work as previously had required one\r\nhundred laborers. For want of the laws necessary to protect his\r\ninvention, Whitney was defrauded of the profits arising from it. Neither\r\nCongress nor the courts gave him any relief from the numerous\r\ninfringements, and he died a poor man.\r\n\r\n[32] The commercial distinction is a sensible one: hair is hard, crisp,\r\nstraight, and does not felt; wool is soft, curly, and felts readily.\r\n\r\n[33] An ounce of eggs produces about forty thousand worms, and these,\r\nduring the grub stage, require about fifteen hundred pounds of leaves,\r\nabout one-half of which is actually consumed.\r\n\r\n[34] Charles II. of England also forbade its use (1675) and attempted to\r\nclose the coffee-houses that had sprung up in London, but in spite of\r\nthe ban and the prohibitive tax laid upon it, the use of coffee became\r\ngeneral. Similar efforts to close the coffee-houses in Constantinople\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\n[35] The full-grown leaf attains a length of from four to nine inches;\r\nthose picked rarely exceed one-and-a-half inches in length.\r\n\r\n[36] Brick tea consists of leaves moulded into bricks under heavy\r\npressure. Refuse and stems are also thus prepared for the cheaper\r\ngrades.\r\n\r\n[37] The following are the chief rubber-producing trees: _Siphonia\r\nelastica_, or _Hevea brasiliensis_, Amazon forests, yields Par\xc3\xa1 rubber;\r\n_Manihot Glaziovii_, also a tapioca-producing shrub, Cear\xc3\xa1 province,\r\nBrazil, furnishes Cear\xc3\xa1 rubber; _Castilloa elastica_, Central American\r\nStates, Nicaragua rubber; _Ficus elastica_, British India, and _Urceola\r\nelastica_, Borneo, Indian rubber. There are rubber-producing trees in\r\nFlorida, but they have little commercial value at the present time.\r\nAfrican rubber is taken from a variety of plants.\r\n\r\n[38] The process of vulcanizing was made practicable during the ten\r\nyears ending in 1850. It was invented and perfected by Goodyear in the\r\nUnited States and by Hancock in England; for ordinary purposes, where\r\nboth strength and elasticity are required, about five per cent. of\r\nsulphur is added. The addition of about fifty per cent. changes the\r\nrubber to a hard black substance known as "ebonite," or "hard rubber."\r\n\r\n[39] In 1823 a Scotchman, Mackintosh, applied the discovery, that rubber\r\ngum was soluble in benzine, to the water-proofing of the cloth that\r\nbears his name. This invention was about the first extensive commercial\r\nuse to which rubber had been put.\r\n\r\n[40] From the fact that most of the dwellings in the United States are\r\nbuilt of wood, the United States is a very heavy consumer of turpentine.\r\n\r\n[41] A slender strip of metallic lead was used instead of graphite in\r\nthe first pencils made. The use of graphite did not become general until\r\nabout 1850. The hardness of a pencil is regulated by mixing clay with\r\nthe powdered graphite.\r\n\r\n[42] These percentages are on the supposition that the ores are\r\nchemically pure; the percentage of metal actually obtained is somewhat\r\nless.\r\n\r\n[43] These percentages are on the supposition that the ores are\r\nchemically pure; the percentage of metal actually obtained is somewhat\r\nless.\r\n\r\n[44] These percentages are on the supposition that the ores are\r\nchemically pure; the percentage of metal actually obtained is somewhat\r\nless.\r\n\r\n[45] These percentages are on the supposition that the ores are\r\nchemically pure; the percentage of metal actually obtained is somewhat\r\nless.\r\n\r\n[46] The limestone has no essential part in the smelting of the ore\r\nexcept to produce an easily-flowing, liquid slag; hence it is called a\r\n_flux_. Some ores smelt and flow so easily that a flux is not required.\r\n\r\n[47] Under ordinary circumstances about two tons of coal, or\r\nthree-quarters of a ton of coke, are required to produce a ton of\r\npig-iron.\r\n\r\n[48] Terne plate is sheet-iron coated with an alloy of lead and tin.\r\n\r\n[49] Heredity is likewise a factor. The seeds of knotty, scraggly trees\r\nare very apt to produce trees of their own kind and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n[50] This sum represents more than ten times the amount of gold coin now\r\nin existence. Less than five per cent. of the business of the great\r\nindustrial centres is a cash business. Even if the money existed, the\r\ntransfer of such immense sums would greatly retard commerce. In order to\r\neffect a speedy settlement of payments, clearing-houses are established.\r\nAt the clearing-house the representatives of the various banks meet\r\ndaily and liquidate the checks drawn against one another; and although\r\nthe total yearly volume of payment aggregates the sum mentioned above,\r\nthe _balances_ for a year are but little more than two billion dollars.\r\nEven this does not always represent cash payment, for a bank that is a\r\ndebtor to another at the close of one day may be a creditor for an equal\r\nsum on the next.\r\n\r\n[51] These roads are financed by the Northern Securities Company and\r\nform a link in the Hill-Morgan lines. Their intercontinental traffic is\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n[52] Their dividing line is the centre of a street.\r\n\r\n[53] The brand consisted of any specific device, such as an initial, a\r\nmonogram, or a conventional form that might be easily recognized. The\r\ndevice was registered and imprinted with a red-hot iron on the flank of\r\nthe animal. Ear-marks, such as notches or similar devices, also\r\nindicated ownership.\r\n\r\n[54] In many cases Government land, not owned by the rancher, has been\r\nfenced in. No objection was made, however, until the sheep-grazier came.\r\nHe demanded the removal of the fences, claiming that he had an equal\r\nright to graze his herds on public lands. But inasmuch as a range once\r\ngrazed by sheep is ruined for cattle-growing, the quarrel between the\r\ngrazier and the rustler has become one in which both the grazier and the\r\nrustler turned upon the sheep-owner.\r\n\r\n[55] It is one-third of their capital stock plus the bonded\r\nindebtedness.\r\n\r\n[56] The high latitude of the wheat-region, which in most cases is too\r\ncold for the growing of food-stuffs, in this region is tempered by\r\noccasional warm winds known as "Chinook winds." These winds are the\r\nsaving feature of wheat-growing. They prevail also in British Columbia,\r\nWashington, and Oregon.\r\n\r\n[57] Freight rates from Coatzacoalcos to San Francisco are already fixed\r\nat $6.50 per ton; by the transcontinental railways they vary from $12 to\r\n$15 per ton.\r\n\r\n[58] The entire Cuban crop is comparatively small, being but little more\r\nthan one-eighth that of the United States.\r\n\r\n[59] Vegetable ivory is the seed or nut of a species of palm\r\n(_Phytelephas macrocarpa_). The kernel of the nut gradually acquires the\r\nhardness and appearance of the best ivory, for which it is employed as a\r\nsubstitute.\r\n\r\n[60] The leaves of this shrub (_Erythroxylon coca_) contain a stimulant\r\nsubstance that in its effects is much like the active principle of\r\ncoffee. They are much used by the native laborers to ward off the\r\nfeeling of lassitude that comes with severe labor in a tropical climate.\r\nA native porter will carry a load of one hundred pounds a distance of\r\nsixty miles with no food or rest, but merely chewing a few coca-leaves.\r\nThe plant yields the substance _cocaine_, now in demand all over the\r\nworld as an an\xc3\xa6sthetic in eye and throat surgery.\r\n\r\n[61] More than a score of species of the tree from which this bark is\r\nobtained grow in the higher eastern slopes of the Andes, but a very\r\nlarge part is obtained from the tree, _Cinchona calisaya_. The medicinal\r\nsubstance, quinine, is extracted from the bark, and in the past\r\nhalf-century it has become the specific for malarial fevers. So great is\r\nthe demand for it, that the cinchona-tree is now cultivated in India,\r\nJava, and Mexico.\r\n\r\n[62] Only a very small proportion of the Panama hats in the market are\r\ngenuine. Many of the imitations, selling at retail for ten dollars or\r\nmore, are serviceable hats; most of them, however, have but little\r\nworth.\r\n\r\n[63] Nitre, or "nitrate," is a native nitrate of potash, or nitrate of\r\nsoda. The latter, commonly called cubic nitre or Chile saltpetre, is the\r\nkind occurring in Chile. Inasmuch as it is very soluble, a plentiful\r\nrainfall would soon leach it from the ground and carry it to the sea.\r\nThe nitrate is thought to be of vegetable origin.\r\n\r\n[64] The pod of a shrub (_C\xc3\xa6salpina coriaria_); it contains a\r\nconsiderable proportion of tannin and is used for tanning leather.\r\n\r\n[65] The pericarp or pod contains about twenty-four prismatic-shaped\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\n[66] The cattle for Cuba and Brazil must be shipped in open pens in\r\ncrossing the tropics. With the exports for Europe the case is different.\r\nIf it is summer at the one port it is winter at the other, but it is\r\nalways summer in the tropics, and cattle-ships fit for one zone are not\r\nfit for the other--hence the great difficulties in shipment of live\r\nanimals to Europe.\r\n\r\n[67] For this reason Great Britain is practically a free-trade country.\r\nA protective tariff on imported food-stuffs and materials to be\r\nmanufactured would hurt rather than protect British industries.\r\n\r\n[68] This is equivalent to the imposition of a tax on all the sugar\r\nconsumed at home.\r\n\r\n[69] Most of the lithographic stone is obtained at Solnhofen.\r\n\r\n[70] This is a little greater than the average ton-mile rate on the New\r\nYork Central Railroad between New York and Chicago.\r\n\r\n[71] The name Zuider, or Zuyder, means "south"; it was so named to\r\ndistinguish it from the North Sea.\r\n\r\n[72] Some years ago many of the most valuable vineyards were destroyed\r\nby an insect pest known as the _phylloxera_, introduced from California.\r\nThe trouble was overcome by replanting with American vines, the roots of\r\nwhich were immune to the pest. On these roots were grafted the choice\r\nFrench vines, the leaves and twigs of which were immune. In this manner\r\nthe vineyards were restored with vines that are proof against attack,\r\nand the wine output has reached its normal amount.\r\n\r\n[73] It is cultivated as an ornamental tree in the Southern States and\r\nin California.\r\n\r\n[74] A small vein of coal occurs near Freiburg.\r\n\r\n[75] The St. Gotthard tunnel is almost nine and one-half miles long; the\r\nArlberg tunnel is six and one-half miles in length. The tunnel now\r\nnearing completion under the Simplon Pass is more than twelve miles\r\nlong. Five railways cross the northern frontier into Germany, and German\r\ncommerce profits most by them.\r\n\r\n[76] Persian rugs are the finest. As a rule the designs are floral and\r\nmany of them contain legendary history worked in fantastic but beautiful\r\npatterns. Among those of especial merit are the Kermanshah tree-of-life\r\nfabrics, now somewhat rare. The rugs of Tabriz and Shiraz are also of\r\nhigh value. In general, Persian fabrics are characterized by very fine\r\nweaving, a short pile, and elaborate designs. Turkoman rugs are usually\r\na rich brown or maroon in color, and are apt to contain slightly\r\nelongated octagonal figures. The Bokhara and Khiva-Bokhara, or Afghan\r\nrugs, are the best examples. The Baluchistan rugs are usually very dark\r\nin color, with bright red designs and striped ends of cotton warp.\r\nTurkish rugs are made almost wholly in Asia Minor or Anatolia. Large\r\ncarpets of American and European designs are made at Ushak and Smyrna.\r\n"Smyrna" rugs are made in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[77] The most valuable Kermanshah rug, now no longer made there, is the\r\ntree-of-life prayer-rug, an illustration of which is shown on p. 350.\r\nThe design is emblematic of the story of the Garden of Eden.\r\n\r\n[78] In 1900 the aggregate value of the wheat exported to Great Britain\r\nwas only \xc2\xa32,200.\r\n\r\n[79] Since the treaty of 1901, which forbids the importation of\r\nfire-arms, a number of large plants for the manufacture of fire-arms,\r\nsmokeless powder, and fixed ammunition have been established on the\r\nlower Yangtze.\r\n\r\n[80] The islands are mainly in the belt of prevailing westerly winds.\r\nMore rain, therefore, falls on the west than on the east coasts.\r\n\r\n[81] This region is also known us the Gold Coast. Formerly it furnished\r\nthe chief British supply of gold, and the gold coin known as the\r\n"guinea" received its name from this circumstance.\r\n\r\n[82] This region was formerly comprised in the Boer republics, Orange\r\nFree State and South African Republic. In 1899 they declared war against\r\nGreat Britain, with the result that they were defeated and annexed to\r\nthat country--the former as Orange Colony, the latter as Transvaal\r\nColony.\r\n\r\n[83] It is estimated that twenty-two acres of land are necessary to\r\nsustain one adult on fresh meat. The same area of wheat would feed\r\nforty-two people; of oats about eighty-five people; of maize, potatoes,\r\nand rice, one hundred and seventy people. But twenty-two acres planted\r\nwith bread-fruit or bananas will support about six thousand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK COMMERCIAL GEOGRAPHY***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 24884-8.txt or 24884-8.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/8/8/24884\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
