The actual amount of knowledge gained at school must needs be\r\nsmall, and often quickly forgotten, but the habit of right study is an\r\ninvaluable possession.\r\n\r\nThe former method of teaching Botany was confined almost wholly to dry,\r\ntechnical classification. The pupil learned to find the name and order of\r\na plant, but its structure, its habits, its life in short, were untouched\r\nby him. We know now that Nature is the best text-book. The pupil should\r\nfirst ask his questions of her and try to interpret her answers; then he\r\nmay learn with profit what those who better understand her speech have to\r\ntell him.\r\n\r\nThis method of teaching, however, requires much, very much, of the\r\nteacher. He must be himself intelligent, well trained, and able to give\r\ntime to the preparation of his lessons. It seems to us, who are but\r\namateurs, as if it were impossible to teach thus without a thorough\r\ncomprehension of the whole field. Our own ignorance oppresses us so much\r\nthat we feel tempted to say that we cannot attempt it. But if the work of\r\nleading children to observe the wonders about them is to be done at all,\r\nit must be done by us, who are not masters of our subject, and we must\r\nfind out for ourselves how we can best accomplish this result, since we\r\nhave so little to guide us.\r\n\r\nIt is with the hope that the experience of one who has tried to do\r\nthis with some fair amount of success may be of use to other puzzled\r\nexperimenters, that I venture to write out some outlines of lessons in\r\nBotany for beginners.\r\n\r\nThe method of beginning with the simpler forms of life is one that appeals\r\nto the scientific tendencies of the day. It seems logical to begin with\r\nlower forms and work up to the higher. But this method is only suitable\r\nfor mature minds. We do not teach a child English by showing him the\r\nsources of the language; he learns it by daily use. So also the beginning\r\nof the study of any Natural Science by the young should be the observation\r\nof the most obvious things about them, the things which they can see, and\r\nhandle, and experiment upon naturally, without artificial aids. Therefore\r\nthis book concerns itself only with the Flowering Plants.\r\n\r\nThe author believes that the simplest botanical study should afford the\r\nmeans of identifying plants, as a large part of the student\'s pleasure in\r\nthe science will be the recognition of the things about him. The present\r\nvolume affords the basis for future classification, which Part II, on\r\nflowers, will develop. It is, doubtless, as good a way, perhaps the best,\r\nto begin with a single plant, and study root, stem, leaves, and flowers\r\nas belonging to a whole, but the problem is complicated by practical\r\ndifficulties. In our climate there are but two months of the school year\r\nwhen flowers are easily obtained. On the other hand, the material for\r\nthese lessons can be got throughout the winter, and the class, well\r\ntrained in methodical work, will begin the study of flowers at the season\r\nwhen every day brings some fresh wonder of beauty.\r\n\r\nThe author will receive gladly any criticisms or suggestions.\r\n\r\nJANE H. NEWELL.\r\n\r\n175 Brattle St., Cambridge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lessons here outlined are suitable for children of twelve years of\r\nage, and upwards. For younger pupils they would require much adaptation,\r\nand even then they would not be so good as some simpler method, such as\r\nfollowing the growth of one plant, and comparing it with others at every\r\nstep. The little ones profit most by describing the very simple things\r\nthat they see, without much reference to theories.\r\n\r\nThe outlines follow the plan of Dr. Gray\'s First Lessons and How Plants\r\nGrow, and are intended to be used in connection with either of those\r\nbooks. The necessary references will be found at the end of every section.\r\nThe book contains also references to a course of interesting reading in\r\nconnection with the subjects of the lessons.\r\n\r\nThe lessons may begin, like the text-books, with the subject of\r\nGermination, if the seeds are planted before they are required for use,\r\nbut it is generally preferable to use the first recitation with the class\r\nfor planting the seeds, in order to have them under the direct care of the\r\npupils. Some general talks about plants are therefore put at the beginning\r\nto occupy the time until the seedlings are ready for study.\r\n\r\nSome Nasturtiums (_Trop\xc3\xa6olum majus_) and Morning-Glories should be planted\r\nfrom the first in boxes of earth and allowed to grow over the window, as\r\nthey are often used for illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nPLANTS AND THEIR USES.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This section may be omitted, and the lessons begun with\r\nSeedlings, if the teacher prefer.]\r\n\r\nWhat is Botany? The pupils are very apt to say at first that it is\r\nlearning about _flowers_. The teacher can draw their attention to the fact\r\nthat flowers are only a part of the plant, and that Botany is also the\r\nstudy of the leaves, the stem, and the root. Botany is the science of\r\n_plants_. Ask them what the Geranium is. Tell them to name some other\r\nplants. The teacher should keep a few growing plants in the schoolroom for\r\npurposes of illustration.\r\n\r\nAsk them what else there is in the world besides plants. By this question\r\nthe three kingdoms, animal, vegetable, and mineral, are brought up. It\r\nwill give occasion for a discussion of the earth and what it contains, the\r\nmountains, formed of rocks and soil, the plants growing on the earth,\r\nand the animals that inhabit it, including man. Let them name the three\r\nkingdoms with some example of each. Which of these kingdoms contain living\r\nthings? The words _organic_ and _inorganic_ can be brought in here. An\r\n_organ_ ([Greek: Ergon], meaning work) is any part that does a special\r\nwork, as the leaves, the stem of a plant, and the eye, the ear of animals.\r\nAn _organism_ is a living being made up of such organs. The inorganic\r\nworld contains the mineral kingdom; the organic world includes the\r\nvegetable and animal kingdoms.\r\n\r\nOne\'s aim in these lessons should always be to tell the pupils as little\r\nas possible. Try to lead them to think out these things for themselves.\r\n\r\nAsk them how plants differ from animals. They will say that plants are\r\nfixed to one place, while animals can move about; that plants have no will\r\nor consciousness, and that animals have. These answers are true when we\r\ncompare the higher animals with plants, but the differences become lost as\r\nwe descend in the scale and approach the border land where botanist and\r\nzoologist meet on a common ground. Sea-anemones are fixed to the rock on\r\nwhich they grow, while some of the lower plants are able to move from\r\nplace to place, and it is hardly safe to affirm that a jelly-fish is more\r\nconscious of its actions than is a Sensitive Plant, the leaves of which\r\nclose when the stem is touched.\r\n\r\nThere is no real division between animals and plants. We try to classify\r\nthe objects about us into groups, according to the closeness of their\r\nrelationships, but we must always remember that these hard lines are ours,\r\nnot Nature\'s. We attempt, for purposes of our own convenience, to divide a\r\nwhole, which is so bound together that it cannot be separated into parts\r\nthat we can confidently place on different sides of a dividing line.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Plants as Food-Producers_.--The chief distinguishing characteristic of\r\nplants is one that the pupils may be led to think out for themselves by\r\nasking them what animals feed upon. To help them with this, ask them what\r\nthey had for breakfast. Oatmeal is mentioned, perhaps. This is made from\r\noats, which is a plant. Coffee and tea, bread made from wheat, potatoes,\r\netc., all come from plants.[1] Beef, butter and milk come from the cow,\r\nbut the cow lives upon grass. The plant, on the other hand, is nourished\r\nupon mineral or inorganic matter. It can make its own food from the soil\r\nand the air, while animals can only live upon that which is made for\r\nthem by plants. These are thus the link between the mineral and animal\r\nkingdoms. Ask the scholars if they can think of anything to eat or drink\r\nthat does not come from a plant. With a little help they will think of\r\nsalt and water. These could not support life. So we see that animals\r\nreceive all their food through the vegetable kingdom. One great use of\r\nplants is that they are _food-producers_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany, for use in Schools. Selected and adapted\r\nfrom well-known authors. Ginn & Co., Boston, New York and Chicago, 1889.\r\nI. Origin of Cultivated Plants.]\r\n\r\nThis lesson may be followed by a talk on food and the various plants used\r\nfor food.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Flour Mills of Minneapolis: Century Magazine, May, 1886.\r\nMaize: Popular Science News, Nov. and Dec., 1888.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Clothing_.--Plants are used for clothing. Of the four great clothing\r\nmaterials, cotton, linen, silk, and woollen, the first two are of\r\nvegetable, the last two of animal origin. Cotton is made from the hairs of\r\nthe seed of the cotton plant.[1] Linen is made of the inner fibre of\r\nthe bark of the flax plant. It has been cultivated from the earliest\r\nhistorical times.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. II. The Cotton Plant.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Purification of the Air_.--The following questions and experiments are\r\nintended to show the pupils, first, that we live in an atmosphere, the\r\npresence of which is necessary to support life and combustion (1) and (2);\r\nsecondly, that this atmosphere is deprived of its power to support life\r\nand combustion by the actions of combustion (2), and of respiration (3);\r\nthirdly, that this power is restored to the air by the action of plants\r\n(4).\r\n\r\nWe have the air about us everywhere. A so-called empty vessel is one\r\nwhere the contents are invisible. The following experiment is a good\r\nillustration of this.\r\n\r\n(1) Wrap the throat of a glass funnel with moistened cloth or paper so\r\nthat it will fit tightly into the neck of a bottle, and fill the funnel\r\nwith water. If the space between the funnel and the bottle is air-tight,\r\nthe water will not flow into the bottle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nDo not explain this in advance to the pupils. Ask them what prevents\r\nthe water from flowing into the bottle. If they are puzzled, loosen the\r\nfunnel, and show them that the water will now flow in. In the first case,\r\nas the air could not escape, the water could not flow in; in the second,\r\nthe air was displaced by the heavier water.\r\n\r\nAsk the pupils why the air in a crowded room becomes so difficult to\r\nbreathe. Could a person live if he were shut up in an air-tight room for a\r\nlong time? Fresh air is necessary to life. The teacher may explain that it\r\nis the oxygen in the air that supports life. Air is composed one-fifth of\r\nthis gas and four-fifths of nitrogen. The gases are mixed and the nitrogen\r\nsimply dilutes the oxygen, as it were.\r\n\r\nFresh air is necessary to support combustion as well as life. Ask them why\r\nwe put out a fire by throwing a blanket or a rug over it. The following\r\nexperiment illustrates this.\r\n\r\n(2) Take a small, wide-mouthed bottle, covered with a card or cork. To\r\nthis cover fasten a piece of bent wire with a taper on the end. Light the\r\ntaper and lower it into the jar. It will burn a few seconds and then go\r\nout. Raise and light it again, and it will be extinguished as soon as it\r\nis plunged into the bottle. This shows that the oxygen of the air is used\r\nup by burning substances, as it is by breathing animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe following experiment shows that fire will not burn in an atmosphere of\r\ngas from our lungs.\r\n\r\n(3) Fill a bottle with gas by breathing into it through a bit of glass\r\ntubing, passed through a card or cork, and reaching to the bottom of the\r\nbottle. The bottle will be dimmed with moisture, showing the presence of\r\naqueous vapor. A lighted match plunged into the bottle will be immediately\r\nextinguished. A better way, which, however, takes some skill in\r\nmanipulation, is to fill the bottle with water, cover it with a flat piece\r\nof glass, and invert the bottle in a dish of water, taking care that no\r\nair bubbles enter. Then, through a bit of glass tubing, blow into the\r\nbottle till the water is expelled. Cover the mouth with the glass under\r\nwater, and holding it tightly down, invert the bottle quickly. Set it\r\ndown, light a match, take away the glass, and at the same instant plunge\r\nin the match. If no air has been allowed to enter, the match will go out\r\nat once. No animal could live in an atmosphere which could not support\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments the pupils have seen that the life-sustaining\r\nquality of the air is used up by combustion and respiration. To bring in\r\nthe subject of purification by plants, ask them why all the oxygen in\r\nthe world is not exhausted by the people and the fires in it. After the\r\nsubject has been explained, the following experiment can be prepared and\r\nput aside till the next lesson.\r\n\r\n(4) Fill two bottles with air from the lungs, as in (3) having previously\r\nintroduced a cutting from a plant into one of the bottles. Allow them to\r\nstand in the sun for a day or two. Then test both bottles with a burning\r\nmatch. If properly done, the result will be very striking. The end of\r\nthe cutting should be in the water of the dish. This experiment will not\r\nsucceed excepting with bottles such as are used for chemicals, which have\r\ntheir mouths carefully ground. Common bottles allow the air to enter\r\nbetween the bottle and the glass.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See note on page 13.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Fuel_.--Light a match and allow it to burn until half charred. Blow it\r\nout gently, so as to leave a glowing spark. When this spark goes out it\r\nwill leave behind a light, gray ash. We have to consider the flame, the\r\ncharred substance, and the ash.\r\n\r\nFlame is burning gas. In all ordinary fuels, carbon and hydrogen, in\r\nvarious combinations and free, make the principal part. The first effect\r\nof the heat is to set free the volatile compounds of carbon and hydrogen.\r\nThe hydrogen then begins to unite with the oxygen of the air, forming\r\nwater, setting free the carbon, which also unites with oxygen, forming\r\ncarbonic acid gas. The burning gases cause the flame. The following\r\nexperiment will illustrate this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n(5) Fit a test-tube with a tight cork, through which a bit of glass\r\ntubing, drawn out into a jet, is passed, the tubing within being even with\r\nthe cork. Place some bits of shaving in the tube, cork it, and make the\r\ncork perfectly air-tight by coating it with bees wax or paraffine. Heat\r\nthe test-tube gently over an alcohol lamp. The wood turns black, and vapor\r\nissues from the jet, which may be lighted (Fig. 4). Care should be taken\r\nto expel all the air before lighting.\r\n\r\n(6) That the burning hydrogen forms water by uniting with the oxygen of\r\nthe air, may be shown by holding a cold glass tumbler over the jet, or\r\nover any flame. The glass will be dimmed by drops of moisture.\r\n\r\nThe charred part of the wood is charcoal, which is one form of carbon.\r\nOur ordinary charcoal is made by driving off all the gases from wood, by\r\nburning it under cover where only a little air can reach it. The volatile\r\ngases burn more readily than the carbon, and are the first substances to\r\nbe driven off, so that the carbon is left behind nearly pure. In the same\r\nway we have driven off all the gases from the half-burned match and left\r\nthe carbon. The teacher should have a piece of charcoal to show the\r\npupils. It still retains all the markings of the wood.\r\n\r\nIf the combustion is continued, the carbon also unites with the oxygen of\r\nthe air, till it is all converted into carbonic acid gas. This was the\r\ncase with the match where we left the glowing spark. The gray ash that was\r\nleft behind is the mineral matter contained in the wood.\r\n\r\n(7) We can show that this gas is formed by pouring lime water into a\r\nbottle in which a candle has been burned as in (2). The water becomes\r\nmilky from a fine white powder formed by the union of the carbonic acid\r\ngas with the lime, forming carbonate of lime. This is a chemical test.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the match is plainly of vegetable origin; so also is the\r\ncharcoal, which is nearly pure carbon. Coal is also carbon, the remains of\r\nancient forests, from which the gases have been slowly driven off by heat\r\nand pressure. All the common fuels are composed principally of carbon and\r\nhydrogen. When these elements unite with oxygen, carbonic acid gas and\r\nwater are formed.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: [Transcriber\'s Note: This note is missing from original\r\ntext.]]\r\n\r\n(8) The same products are formed by respiration. We breathe out carbonic\r\nacid gas and water from our lungs. Breathe on a cold glass. It is bedewed\r\nexactly as it is by the candle flame. Breathe through a bit of glass\r\ntubing into a bottle of lime water. It becomes milky, showing the presence\r\nof carbonic acid gas. Why is this?\r\n\r\nEvery act or thought is accompanied by a consumption of material in the\r\nbody, which thus becomes unfit for further use. These waste substances,\r\ncomposed chiefly of carbon and hydrogen, unite with oxygen breathed in\r\nfrom the air, forming carbonic acid gas and water, which are breathed\r\nout of the system. The action is a process of slow combustion, and it is\r\nprincipally by the heat thus evolved that the body is kept warm. As we are\r\nthus constantly taking oxygen from the air, a close room becomes unfit to\r\nlive in and a supply of fresh air is indispensable. The cycle of changes\r\nis completed by the action of plants, which take in carbonic acid gas, use\r\nthe carbon, and return most of the oxygen to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR EXPERIMENTS.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The glass apparatus required, including an alcohol lamp, may\r\nbe obtained for one dollar by sending to the Educational Supply Co., No. 6\r\nHamilton Place, Boston.]\r\n\r\nTwo small wide-mouthed bottles.

III, 279-288.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSEEDLINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Directions for raising in the Schoolroom_.--The seeds should be\r\nplanted in boxes tilled with clean sand. Plates or shallow crockery pans\r\nare also used, but the sand is apt to become caked, and the pupils are\r\nlikely to keep the seeds too wet if they are planted in vessels that\r\nwill not drain. The boxes should be covered with panes of glass till the\r\nseedlings are well started, and should be kept at a temperature of from\r\n65\xc2\xb0 to 70\xc2\xb0 Fahr. It is very important to keep them covered while the seeds\r\nare germinating, otherwise the sand will be certain to become too dry if\r\nkept in a sufficiently warm place. Light is not necessary, and in winter\r\ntime the neighborhood of the furnace is often a very convenient place\r\nto keep them safe from frost. They should not be in the sun while\r\ngerminating. When the first sprouts appear above the ground let another\r\nset be planted, and so on, till a series is obtained ranging from plants\r\nseveral inches high to those just starting from the seed. The seeds\r\nthemselves should be soaked for a day and the series is then ready\r\nfor study. The time required for their growth varies according to the\r\ntemperature, moisture, etc. Dr. Goodale says they should be ready in ten\r\ndays.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Concerning a few Common Plants, by G.L. Goodale, Boston, D.C.\r\nHeath & Co. This little book, which is published, in pamphlet form, for\r\nfifteen cents, will be found exceedingly useful.]\r\n\r\nI have never been able to raise them so quickly in the schoolroom, nor\r\nhave the pupils to whom I have given them to plant done so at home.\r\nGenerally, it is three weeks, at least, before the first specimens are as\r\nlarge as is desirable.\r\n\r\nGerminating seeds need warmth, moisture and air. The necessary conditions\r\nare supplied in the very best way by growing them on sponge, but it would\r\nbe difficult to raise enough for a large class in this manner. Place a\r\npiece of moist sponge in a jelly-glass, or any glass that is larger at the\r\ntop, so that the sponge may not sink to the bottom, and pour some water\r\ninto the glass, but not so much as to touch the sponge. The whole should\r\nbe covered with a larger inverted glass, which must not be so close as\r\nto prevent a circulation of air. The plants can thus be watched at every\r\nstage and some should always be grown in this way. The water in the\r\ntumbler will keep the sponge damp, and the roots, after emerging from\r\nthe sponge, will grow well in the moist air. Seeds can also be grown on\r\nblotting paper. Put the seeds on several thicknesses of moist blotting\r\npaper on a plate, cover them with more moist paper, and invert another\r\nplate over them, taking care to allow the free entrance of air.\r\n\r\nIf possible, it is by far the best way to have the seeds growing in the\r\nschoolroom, and make it a regular custom for the pupils to observe them\r\nevery morning and take notes of their growth.\r\n\r\nThese lessons on seeds are suitable for pupils of every age, from adults\r\nto the youngest children who go to school. The difference should be only\r\nin the mode of treatment; but the same principles should be brought out,\r\nwhatever the age and power of comprehension of the pupil.\r\n\r\nFor these lessons the following seeds should be planted, according to the\r\nabove directions:\r\n\r\nMorning-Glory, Sunflower or Squash, Bean, Pea, Red Clover, Flax, Corn,\r\nWheat, and Oats.[1] If they can be procured plant also acorns, Pine-seeds,\r\nMaple-seeds, and horsechestnuts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A package of these seeds may be obtained for fifty cents,\r\nfrom Joseph Breck & Son, Boston, Mass. They will be sent by mail, postage\r\npaid.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Study of Morning-Glory, Sunflower, Bean, and Pea_.--For reasons\r\nhereafter given, I consider the Morning-Glory the best seedling to begin\r\nupon. Having a series, as above described, before them, the pupils should\r\ndraw the seedlings. When the drawings are made, let them letter alike the\r\ncorresponding parts, beginning with the plantlet in the seed, and using\r\nnew letters when a new part is developed. The seed coats need not be\r\nlettered, as they do not belong to the plantlet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Germination of Morning Glory, _a_, caulicle; _b_,\r\ncotyledons; _c_, plumule; _d_, roots.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Germination of Sunflower.]\r\n\r\nAfter drawing the Morning-Glory series, let them draw the Sunflower or\r\nSquash in the same way, then the Bean, and finally the Pea. Let them write\r\nanswers to the following questions:\r\n\r\nMORNING-GLORY.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It has been objected that the Morning-Glory seed is too small\r\nto begin upon. If the teacher prefer, he may begin with the Squash, Bean,\r\nand Pea. The questions will require but little alteration, and he can take\r\nup the Morning-Glory later.]\r\n\r\nTell the parts of the Morning-Glory seed.\r\n\r\nWhat part grows first?\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of the seed-covering?\r\n\r\nWhat appears between the first pair of leaves?\r\n\r\nWas this to be seen in the seed?\r\n\r\nHow many leaves are there at each joint of stem after the first pair?\r\n\r\nHow do they differ from the first pair?\r\n\r\nSUNFLOWER OR SQUASH.\r\n\r\nWhat are the parts of the seed?\r\n\r\nWhat is there in the Morning-Glory seed that this has not?\r\n\r\nHow do the first leaves change as the seedling grows?\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAN.\r\n\r\nWhat are the parts of the seed?\r\n\r\nHow does this differ from the Morning-Glory seed?\r\n\r\nHow from the Sunflower seed?\r\n\r\nHow do the first pair of leaves of the Bean change as they grow?\r\n\r\nHow many leaves are there at each joint of stem?[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There are two simple leaves at the next node to the\r\ncotyledons; after these there is one compound leaf at each node.]\r\n\r\nHow do they differ from the first pair?\r\n\r\n\r\nPEA.\r\n\r\nWhat are the parts of the seed? Compare it with the Morning-Glory,\r\nSunflower, and Bean.\r\n\r\nHow does it differ in its growth from the Bean?\r\n\r\nWhat have all these four seeds in common?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Germination of Pea. _a_, caulicle; _b_,\r\ncotyledons; _c_, plumule; _d_, roots.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Germination of Bean.]\r\n\r\nWhat has the Morning-Glory seed that the others have not?\r\n\r\nWhat have the Bean and Pea that the Morning-Glory has not?\r\n\r\nHow does the Pea differ from all the others in its growth?\r\n\r\nWhat part grows first in all these seeds?\r\n\r\nFrom which part do the roots grow?\r\n\r\nWhat peculiarity do you notice in the way they come up out of the\r\nground?[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This question refers to the arched form in which they come\r\nup. In this way the tender, growing apex is not rubbed.]\r\n\r\nThe teacher must remember that, unless the pupils have had some previous\r\ntraining, they will first have to learn to use their eyes, and for this\r\nthey will need much judicious help. They should be assisted to see what is\r\nbefore them, not told what is there. It is absolutely necessary that these\r\nquestions should be thoroughly understood and correctly answered before\r\nany conclusions are drawn from them. For this purpose abundant material is\r\nindispensable. It is better not to attempt these lessons on seeds at\r\nall, unless there is material enough for personal observation by all the\r\npupils.\r\n\r\nAfter this preliminary work has been done, the names of the parts can\r\nbe given to the pupils. They may be written under each drawing\r\nthus,--A=Caulicle;[1] B=Cotyledons; C=Roots; D=Plumule. The whole plantlet\r\nin the seed is the _embryo_ or _germ_, whence the sprouting of seeds is\r\ncalled _germination_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The term radicle is still in general use. The derivation\r\n(little root) makes it undesirable. Dr. Gray has adopted caulicle (little\r\nstem) in the latest edition of his text-book, which I have followed. Other\r\nwriters use the term hypocotyl, meaning under the cotyledons.]\r\n\r\nI consider this the best order to study the seeds because in the\r\nMorning-Glory the cotyledons are plainly leaves in the seed; and in the\r\nSquash or Sunflower[2] the whole process is plainly to be seen whereby\r\na thick body, most unlike a leaf, becomes an ordinary green leaf with\r\nveins.[3] In the Sunflower the true leaves are nearly the same shape as\r\nthe cotyledons, so that this is an especially good illustration for the\r\npurpose. Thus, without any hint from me, my pupils often write of the\r\nBean, "it has two thick leaves and two thin leaves." In this way the Bean\r\nand Pea present no difficulty. The cotyledons in the first make apparently\r\nan unsuccessful effort to become leaves, which the second give up\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The large Russian Sunflower is the best for the purpose.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: These lessons are intended, as has been said, for children\r\nover twelve years of age. If they are adapted for younger ones, it is\r\nespecially important to begin with a seed where the leaf-like character\r\nof the cotyledons is evident, or becomes so. Maple is excellent for the\r\npurpose. Morning-Glory is too small. Squash will answer very well. I think\r\nit characteristic of the minds of little children to associate a term with\r\nthe first specimen to which it is applied. If the term cotyledon be given\r\nthem first for those of the Bean and Pea they will say when they come to\r\nthe Morning-Glory, "but those are _leaves_, not cotyledons. Cotyledons are\r\nlarge and round." It will be very difficult to make them understand that\r\ncotyledons are the first seed-leaves, and they will feel as if it were a\r\nforced connection, and one that they cannot see for themselves.]\r\n\r\nThe teacher\'s object now is to make the pupils understand the meaning of\r\nthe answers they have given to these questions. In the first place, they\r\nshould go over their answers and substitute the botanical terms they have\r\njust learned for the ones they have used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF THE PARTS OF THE SOAKED SEEDS.\r\n\r\n_Morning-Glory_. A seed covering. Some albumen. Two cotyledons. A\r\ncaulicle.\r\n\r\n_Sunflower_. An outer covering.[1] An inner covering. Two cotyledons. A\r\ncaulicle.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The so-called seed of Sunflower is really a fruit. The outer\r\ncovering is the wall of the ovary, the inner the seed-coat. Such closed,\r\none-seeded fruits are called akenes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The plumule is sometimes visible in the embryo of the\r\nSunflower.]\r\n\r\n_Bean_. A seed covering. Two cotyledons. A caulicle. A plumule.\r\n\r\n_Pea_. The same as the Bean.\r\n\r\nThey have also learned how the first leaves in the last three differ from\r\nthose of the Morning-Glory, being considerably thicker in the Sunflower,\r\nand very much thicker in the Bean and Pea. Why should the Morning-Glory\r\nhave this jelly that the others have not? Why do the first leaves of the\r\nSunflower change so much as the seedling grows? What becomes of their\r\nsubstance? Why do those of the Bean shrivel and finally drop off? By this\r\ntime some bright pupil will have discovered that the baby-plant needs food\r\nand that this is stored around it in the Morning-Glory, and in the leaves\r\nthemselves in the others. It is nourished upon this prepared food, until\r\nit has roots and leaves and can make its own living. The food of the\r\nMorning-Glory is called _albumen_; it does not differ from the others in\r\nkind, but only in its manner of storage.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. III. Seed-Food.]\r\n\r\nAlso the questions have brought out the fact that the Bean and Pea\r\nhave the plumule ready formed in the seed, while the Morning-Glory and\r\nSunflower have not. Why should this be? It is because there is so much\r\nfood stored in the first two that the plumule can develop before a root is\r\nformed, while in the others there is only nourishment sufficient to enable\r\nthe plantlet to form its roots. These must make the second leaves by their\r\nown labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Comparison with other Dicotyledons_.--The pupils should now have other\r\nseeds to compare with these four. Let them arrange Flax, Four o-clock,\r\nHorsechestnut, Almond, Nasturtium, Maple-seeds, etc., under two heads.\r\n\r\n_Seeds with the Food stored               _Seeds with the Food stored\r\noutside the plantlet                      in the embryo itself\r\n(Albuminous)_.                            (Exalbuminous)_.\r\n\r\nFlax. Four-o\'clock.                       Acorn. Horsechestnut. Almond.\r\nMorning-Glory.                            Maple. Sunflower. Squash.\r\n                                          Bean. Pea. Nasturtium.\r\n\r\nThey may also be divided into those with and without the plumule.\r\n\r\n_Without Plumule_.                        _With Plumule_.\r\n\r\nFlax. Maple. Sunflower.                   Acorn. Horsechestnut.\r\nFour-o\'clock.                             Almond. Bean. Pea.\r\nMorning-Glory.                            Squash. Nasturtium.\r\n\r\nThose with plumules will be seen to have the most abundant nourishment. In\r\nmany cases this is made use of by man.\r\n\r\nThese last can be again divided into those in which the cotyledons come up\r\ninto the air and those where they remain in the ground.\r\n\r\n_In the Air_.                             _In the Ground_.\r\n\r\nBean. Almond. Squash.                     Acorn. Horsechestnut.\r\n                                          Pea. Nasturtium.\r\n\r\nIn the latter the cotyledons are so heavily gorged with nourishment that\r\nthey never become of any use as leaves. As Darwin points out, they have\r\na better chance of escaping destruction by animals by remaining in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe cotyledons are very good illustrations of the different uses to which\r\na single organ may be put, and the thorough understanding of it will\r\nprepare the pupils\' minds for other metamorphoses, and for the theory that\r\nall the various parts of a plant are modified forms of a very few members.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Nature of the Caulicle_.--Probably some of the pupils will have called\r\nthe caulicle the root. It is, however, of the nature of stem. The root\r\ngrows only at the end, from a point just behind the tip; the stem\r\nelongates throughout its whole length. This can be shown by marking the\r\nstem and roots of a young seedling with ink. India ink must be used, as\r\ncommon ink injures the plants. Dip a needle in the ink and prick a row\r\nof spots at equal distances on a young root. Corn is very good for this\r\npurpose, but Morning-Glory or Bean is better for experiments on the\r\nstem. The plants should then be carefully watched and the changes in\r\nthe relative distance of the spots noted. The experiment is very easily\r\nconducted with the seedlings growing on sponge, with their roots in the\r\nmoist air of the tumbler, as before described.\r\n\r\nDr. Goodale says of this experiment,--"Let a young seedling of corn be\r\ngrown on damp paper in the manner described in No. 1,[1] and when the\r\nlongest root is a few centimetres long let it be marked very carefully by\r\nmeans of India ink, or purple ink, put on with a delicate camel\'s-hair\r\npencil just one centimetre apart. Plants thus marked are to be kept under\r\nfavorable conditions with respect to moisture and warmth, so that growth\r\nwill be as rapid as possible. The marks on the older part of the root\r\nwill not change their relative distance, but the mark at the tip will be\r\ncarried away from the one next it, showing that the growth has taken place\r\nonly at this point. Such experiments as the one described are perfectly\r\npracticable for all classes of pupils except the very youngest. How far\r\nthe details of these experiments should be suggested to the pupils, or\r\nrather how far they should be left to work out the problem for themselves,\r\nis a question to be settled by the teacher in each case. The better plan\r\ngenerally is to bring the problem in a very clear form before the whole\r\nclass, or before the whole school, and ask whether anybody can think of a\r\nway in which it can be solved; for instance, in this case how can it be\r\nfound out whether roots grow only at their tip or throughout their whole\r\nlength. If the way is thought out by even a single pupil the rest will be\r\ninterested in seeing whether the plan will work successfully."\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Concerning a Few Common Plants, page 25.]\r\n\r\nI have been more successful in pricking the roots than in marking them\r\nwith a brush.\r\n\r\nThe caulicle can be proved by the manner of its growth to be of the nature\r\nof stem, not root. The main root grows from its naked end. Roots can also\r\ngrow from the sides of the caulicle, as in Indian Corn. In this, it acts\r\nprecisely as does the stem of a cutting. It can be prettily shown with the\r\nseedlings by breaking off a bean at the ground and putting the slip in\r\nwater. It will throw out roots and the pupil will readily understand that\r\nthe caulicle does the same thing.\r\n\r\nDarwin has made very interesting experiments on the movements of\r\nseedlings. If the teacher wishes to repeat some of the experiments he will\r\nfind the details very fully given in "The Power of Movement of Plants."[1]\r\nThe pupils can observe in their growing seedlings some of the points\r\nmentioned and have already noticed a few in their answers. They have said\r\nthat the caulicle was the part to grow first, and have spoken of the\r\narched form of the young stem. Their attention should also be drawn to the\r\nroot-hairs, which are well seen in Corn, Wheat, and Oats. They absorb the\r\nliquid food of the plants. A secondary office is to hold the seed firmly,\r\nso that the caulicle can enter the ground. This is shown in Red Clover,\r\nwhich may be sown on the surface of the ground. It puts out root-hairs,\r\nwhich attach themselves to the particles of sand and hold the seed. These\r\nhairs are treated more fully in the lessons on roots.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Power of Movement in Plants. By Charles Darwin. London.\r\nJohn Murray, 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. IV. Movements of Seedlings.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Leaves of Seedlings_.--Coming now to the question as to the number of\r\nleaves at each joint of the stem, the Morning-Glory, Sunflower, and Bean\r\nwill present no difficulty, but probably all the pupils will be puzzled by\r\nthe Pea. The stipules, so large and leaf-like, look like two leaves,\r\nwith a stem between, bearing other opposite leaves, and terminating in a\r\ntendril, while in the upper part it could not be told by a beginner which\r\nwas the continuation of the main stem. For these reasons I left this out\r\nin the questions on the Pea, but it should be taken up in the class. How\r\nare we to tell what constitutes a single leaf? The answer to this question\r\nis that buds come in the _axils_ of single leaves; that is, in the inner\r\nangle which the leaf makes with the stem. If no bud can be seen in the\r\nPea, the experiment may be tried of cutting off the top of the seedling\r\nplant. Buds will be developed in the axils of the nearest leaves, and it\r\nwill be shown that each is a compound leaf with two appendages at its\r\nbase, called stipules, and with a tendril at its apex. Buds can be forced\r\nin the same way to grow from the axils of the lower scales, and even from\r\nthose of the cotyledons, and the lesson may be again impressed that organs\r\nare capable of undergoing great modifications. The teacher may use his own\r\njudgment as to whether he will tell them that the tendril is a modified\r\nleaflet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. 1. Grain of Indian Corn. 2. Vertical section,\r\ndividing the embryo, _a_, caulicle: _b_, cotyledon; _c_, plumule. 3.\r\nVertical section, at right angles to the last.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Monocotyledons_.--These are more difficult. Perhaps it is not worth\r\nwhile to attempt to make the pupils see the embryo in Wheat and Oats. But\r\nthe embryo of Indian Corn is larger and can be easily examined after long\r\nsoaking. Removing the seed-covering, we find the greater part of the seed\r\nto be albumen. Closely applied to one side of this, so closely that it\r\nis difficult to separate it perfectly, is the single cotyledon. This\r\ncompletely surrounds the plumule and furnishes it with food from the\r\nalbumen. There is a line down the middle, and, if we carefully bend back\r\nthe edges of the cotyledon, it splits along this line, showing the\r\nplumule and caulicle within. The plumule consists of successive layers of\r\nrudimentary leaves, the outer enclosing the rest (Fig. 10, 1, _c_). The\r\nlatter is the first leaf and remains undeveloped as a scaly sheath (Fig.\r\n10, 2, _c_). In Wheat and Oats the cotyledon can be easily seen in the\r\nlargest seedlings by pulling off the dry husk of the grain. The food will\r\nhe seen to have been used up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. 1. Germination of Indian corn. 2. Same more\r\nadvanced. _a_, caulicle; _c_1, first leaf of the plumule, sheathing the\r\nrest; _c_2, second leaf; _c_3, third leaf of the plumule; _d_, roots.]\r\n\r\nThe series of Corn seedlings, at least, should be drawn as before and\r\nthe parts marked, this time with their technical terms. The following\r\nquestions should then be prepared.\r\n\r\nCORN.\r\n\r\nWhat are the parts of the seed?\r\n\r\nCompare these parts with the Morning-Glory, Sunflower, Bean, and Pea.\r\n\r\nWhere is the food stored?\r\n\r\nHow many cotyledons have Corn, Wheat, and Oats?\r\n\r\nHow many have Bean, Pea, Morning-Glory, and Sunflower?\r\n\r\nCompare the veins of the leaves of each class and see what difference you\r\ncan find.\r\n\r\nThis will bring up the terms dicotyledon and monocotyledon. _Di_ means\r\ntwo, _mono_ means one. This difference in the veins, netted in the first\r\nclass, parallel in the second, is characteristic of the classes. Pupils\r\nshould have specimens of leaves to classify under these two heads.\r\nFlowering plants are divided first into these two classes, the\r\nDicotyledons and the Monocotyledons.\r\n\r\nIf Pine-seeds can be planted, the polycotyledonous embryo can also be\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Food of seedlings_.--The food of the Wheat seedling may be shown in\r\nfine flour. [1]"The flour is to be moistened in the hand and kneaded until\r\nit becomes a homogeneous mass. Upon this mass pour some pure water and\r\nwash out all the white powder until nothing is left except a viscid lump\r\nof gluten. This is the part of the crushed wheat-grains which very closely\r\nresembles in its composition the flesh of animals. The white powder washed\r\naway is nearly pure wheat-starch. Of course the other ingredients, such as\r\nthe mineral matter and the like, might be referred to, but the starch at\r\nleast should be shown. When the seed is placed in proper soil, or upon a\r\nsupport where it can receive moisture, and can get at the air and still be\r\nwarm enough, a part of the starch changes into a sort of gum, like that on\r\npostage stamps, and finally becomes a kind of sugar. Upon this sirup the\r\nyoung seedling feeds until it has some good green leaves for work, and as\r\nwe have seen in the case of some plants it has these very early."\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Concerning a Few Common Plants, page 18.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of starch can be shown by testing with a solution of iodine.\r\nStarch is turned blue by iodine and may thus be detected in flour, in\r\nseeds, in potatoes, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter all this careful experimental work the subject may be studied in the\r\ntext-book and recited, the recitation constituting a thorough review of\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nA charming description of the germination of a seed will be found in the\r\nReader. V. The Birth of Picciola.\r\n\r\n_Gray\'s Lessons_. Sect. II, 8-14. III. _How Plants Grow_. Sect. I, 22, 23.\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nROOTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject can be treated more conveniently while the young seedlings\r\nare still growing, because their roots are very suitable for study. It\r\nseems best, therefore, to take it up before examining the buds.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Study of the Roots of Seedlings_.--One or two of the seedlings should\r\nbe broken off and the slips put into a glass of water. They will be\r\nstudied later. Bean and Sunflower are the best for the purpose.\r\n\r\nBegin by telling the pupils to prepare for their first lesson a\r\ndescription of the roots of their seedlings. Those grown on sponge or\r\npaper will show the development of the root-hairs, while those grown on\r\nsand are better for studying the form of the root. Give them also some\r\nfleshy root to describe, as a carrot, or a radish; and a spray of English\r\nIvy, as an example of a\xc3\xabrial roots.\r\n\r\nThroughout these lessons, the method is pursued of giving pupils specimens\r\nto observe and describe before teaching them botanical terms. It is better\r\nfor them to name the things they see than to find examples for terms\r\nalready learned. In the first case, they feel the difficulty of expressing\r\nthemselves and are glad to have the want of exact terms supplied. This\r\nmethod is discouraging at first, especially to the younger ones; but,\r\nwith time and patience, they will gradually become accustomed to describe\r\nwhatever they can see. They have, at any rate, used their eyes; and,\r\nthough they may not understand the real meaning of anything they have\r\nseen, they are prepared to discuss the subject intelligently when they\r\ncome together in the class. If they will first write out their unassisted\r\nimpressions and, subsequently, an account of the same thing after they\r\nhave had a recitation upon it, they will be sure to gain something in the\r\npower of observation and clear expression. It cannot be too strongly\r\nurged that the number of facts that the children may learn is not of the\r\nslightest consequence, but that the teacher should aim to cultivate the\r\nquick eye, the ready hand, and the clear reason.\r\n\r\nThe root of the Morning-Glory is _primary_; it is a direct downward growth\r\nfrom the tip of the caulicle. It is about as thick as the stem, tapers\r\ntowards the end, and has short and fibrous branches. In some plants the\r\nroot keeps on growing and makes a _tap-root_; in the Bean, it soon becomes\r\nlost in the branches. These are all simple, that is, there is but one\r\nprimary root. Sometimes there are several or many, and the root is then\r\nsaid to be _multiple_. The Pumpkin is an example of this. The root of\r\nthe Pea is described in the older editions of Gray\'s Lessons as being\r\nmultiple, but it is generally simple. Indian Corn, also, usually starts\r\nwith a single root, but this does not make a tap-root, and is soon\r\nfollowed by many others from any part of the caulicle, or even from the\r\nstem above, giving it the appearance of having a multiple root.\r\n\r\nThe root of the Radish is different from any of these; it is _fleshy_.\r\nOften, it tapers suddenly at the bottom into a root like that of\r\nthe Morning-Glory with some fibres upon it. It is, in fact, as the\r\nMorning-Glory would be if the main root were to be thickened up by\r\nfood being stored in it. It is a primary tap-root. The radish is\r\n_spindle-shaped_, tapering at top and bottom, the carrot is _conical_, the\r\nturnip is called _napiform_; some radishes are shaped like the turnip.\r\n\r\nThe a\xc3\xabrial roots of the English Ivy answer another purpose than that of\r\ngiving nourishment to the plant. They are used to support it in climbing.\r\nThese are an example of _secondary_ roots, which are roots springing\r\nlaterally from any part of the stem. The Sweet Potato has both fleshy and\r\nfibrous roots and forms secondary roots of both kinds every year.[1] Some\r\nof the seedlings will probably show the root-hairs to the naked eye. These\r\nwill be noticed hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gray\'s Lessons, p. 35, Fig. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--1. Tap-root. 2. Multiple root of Pumpkin. 3.\r\nNapiform root of Turnip. 4. Spindle-shaped root of Radish. 5. Conical root\r\nof Carrot. 6. A\xc3\xabrial roots of Ivy.]\r\n\r\nIt is my experience that pupils always like classifying things under\r\ndifferent heads, and it is a good exercise. The following table may be\r\nmade of the roots they have studied, adding other examples. Dr. Gray says\r\nthat ordinary roots may be roughly classed into fibrous and fleshy.[1]\r\nThom\xc3\xa9 classes them as woody and fleshy.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gray\'s Lessons, p. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Text-book of Structural and Physiological Botany.

The teacher can say that this will be explained later.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Fleshy Roots_.--The scholars are already familiar with the storing\r\nof food for the seedling in or around the cotyledons, and will readily\r\nunderstand that these roots are storehouses of food for the plant. The\r\nTurnip, Carrot, and Beet are _biennials_; that is, their growth is\r\ncontinued through two seasons. In the first year, they make a vigorous\r\ngrowth of leaves alone, and the surplus food is carried to the root in the\r\nform of a syrup, and there stored, having been changed into starch, or\r\nsomething very similar. At the end of the first season, the root is filled\r\nwith food, prepared for the next year, so that the plant can live on its\r\nreserve fund and devote its whole attention to flowering. These roots\r\nare often good food for animals. There are some plants that store their\r\nsurplus food in their roots year after year, using up in each season the\r\nstore of the former one, and forming new roots continually. The Sweet\r\nPotato is an example of this class. These are _perennials_. The food in\r\nperennials, however, is usually stored in stems, rather than in roots, as\r\nin trees. _Annuals_ are generally fibrous-rooted, and the plant dies after\r\nits first year. The following experiment will serve as an illustration of\r\nthe way in which the food stored in fleshy roots is utilized for growth.\r\n\r\nCut off the tapering end of a carrot and scoop out the inside of the\r\nlarger half in the form of a vase, leaving about half of the flesh behind.\r\nPut strings through the upper rim, fill the carrot cup with water, and\r\nhang it up in a sunny window. Keep it constantly full of water. The\r\nleaf-buds below will put forth, and grow into leafy shoots, which, turning\r\nupwards, soon hide the vase in a green circle. This is because the dry,\r\nstarchy food stored in the carrot becomes soft and soluble, and the supply\r\nof proper food and the warmth of the room make the leaf-buds able to grow.\r\nIt is also a pretty illustration of the way in which stems always grow\r\nupward, even though there is enough light and air for them to grow\r\nstraight downwards. Why this is so, we do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Differences between the Stem and the Root.--_Ask the pupils to tell\r\nwhat differences they have found.\r\n\r\n_Stems_.                           _Roots_.\r\n\r\nAscend into the air.               Descend into the ground.\r\nGrow by a succession of similar    Grow only from a point\r\n  parts, each part when young        just behind the tip.\r\n  elongating throughout.\r\nBear organs.                       Bear no organs.\r\n\r\nThere are certain exceptions to the statement that roots descend into the\r\nground; such as a\xc3\xabrial roots and parasitic roots. The a\xc3\xabrial roots of the\r\nIvy have been mentioned. Other examples of roots used for climbing are\r\nthe Trumpet Creeper _(Tecoma radicans)_, and the Poison Ivy _(Rhus\r\nToxicodendron)_. Parasitic roots take their food ready-made from the\r\nplants into which they strike. The roots of air-plants, such as certain\r\norchids, draw their nourishment from the air.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of marking roots and stem has been already tried, but it\r\nshould be repeated. Repetition of experiments is always desirable, as it\r\nfixes his conclusions in the pupil\'s mind. The stem grows by a succession\r\nof similar parts, _phytomera_, each part, or _phyton_, consisting of node,\r\ninternode, and leaf. Thus it follows that stems must bear leaves. The\r\nmarked stems of seedlings show greater growth towards the top of the\r\ngrowing phyton. It is only young stems that elongate throughout. The older\r\nparts of a phyton grow little, and when the internode has attained a\r\ncertain length, variable for different stems and different conditions, it\r\ndoes not elongate at all.\r\n\r\nThe root, on the contrary, grows only from a point just behind the tip.\r\nThe extreme tip consists of a sort of cap of hard tissue, called the\r\nroot-cap. Through a simple lens, or sometimes with the naked eye, it can\r\nbe distinguished in most of the roots of the seedlings, looking like a\r\ntransparent tip. "The root, whatever its origin in any case may be, grows\r\nin length only in one way; namely, at a point just behind its very\r\ntip. This growing point is usually protected by a peculiar cap, which\r\ninsinuates its way through the crevices of the soil. If roots should grow\r\nas stems escaping from the bud-state do,--that is, throughout their whole\r\nlength--they would speedily become distorted. But, since they grow at the\r\nprotected tips, they can make their way through the interstices of soil,\r\nwhich from its compactness would otherwise forbid their progress."[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Concerning a few Common Plants, p. 25.]\r\n\r\nThe third difference is that, while the stem bears leaves, and has buds\r\nnormally developed in their axils, roots bear no organs. The stem,\r\nhowever, especially when wounded, may produce buds anywhere from the\r\nsurface of the bark, and these buds are called _adventitious_ buds. In the\r\nsame manner, roots occasionally produce buds, which grow up into leafy\r\nshoots, as in the Apple and Poplar.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Gray\'s Structural Botany, p. 29.]\r\n\r\nIt should be made perfectly clear that the stem is the axis of the plant,\r\nthat is, it bears all the other organs. Roots grow from stems, not steins\r\nfrom roots, except in certain cases, like that of the Poplar mentioned\r\nabove. This was seen in the study of the seedling. The embryo consisted of\r\nstem and leaves, and the roots were produced from the stem as the seedling\r\ngrew.\r\n\r\nFor illustration of this point, the careful watching of the cuttings\r\nplaced in water will be very instructive. After a few days, small, hard\r\nlumps begin to appear under the skin of the stem of the broken seedling\r\nBean. These gradually increase in size until, finally, they rupture the\r\nskin and appear as rootlets. Roots are always thus formed under the outer\r\ntissues of the stem from which they spring, or the root from which they\r\nbranch. In the Bean, the roots are in four long rows, quartering the stem.\r\nThis is because they are formed in front of the woody bundles of the stem,\r\nwhich in the seedling Bean are four. In the Sunflower the roots divide the\r\ncircumference into six parts. In some of my cuttings of Beans, the stem\r\ncracked in four long lines before the roots had really formed, showing the\r\nparenchyma in small hillocks, so to speak. In these the gradual formation\r\nof the root-cap could be watched throughout, with merely a small lens. I\r\ndo not know a better way to impress the nature of the root on the pupil\'s\r\nmind. These forming roots might also be marked very early, and so be shown\r\nto carry onward their root-cap on the growing-point.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Root-hairs_. These are outgrowths of the epidermis, or skin of the\r\nroot, and increase its absorbing power. In most plants they cannot be seen\r\nwithout the aid of a microscope. Indian Corn and Oats, however, show them\r\nvery beautifully, and the scholars have already noticed them in their\r\nseedlings. They are best seen in the seedlings grown on damp sponge. In\r\nthose grown in sand, they become so firmly united to the particles of\r\nsoil, that they cannot be separated, without tearing the hairs away from\r\nthe plant. This will suggest the reason why plants suffer so much from\r\ncareless transplanting.\r\n\r\nThe root-hairs have the power of dissolving mineral matters in the soil\r\nby the action of an acid which they give out. They then absorb these\r\nsolutions for the nourishment of the plant. The acid given out was first\r\nthought to be carbonic acid, but now it is supposed by some experimenters\r\nto be acetic acid, by others to vary according to the plant and the time.\r\nThe action can be shown by the following experiment, suggested by Sachs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. I. Seedling of _Sinapis alba_ showing root-hairs.\r\nII. Same, showing how fine particles of sand cling to the root-hairs.\r\n(Sachs.)]\r\n\r\nCover a piece of polished marble with moist sawdust, and plant some seeds\r\nupon it. When the seedlings are somewhat grown, remove the sawdust, and\r\nthe rootlets will be found to have left their autographs behind. Wherever\r\nthe roots, with their root-hairs have crept, they have eaten into the\r\nmarble and left it corroded. The marks will become more distinct if the\r\nmarble is rubbed with a little vermilion.\r\n\r\nIn order that the processes of solution and absorption may take place, it\r\nis necessary that free oxygen should be present. All living things must\r\nhave oxygen to breathe, and this gas is as needful for the germination of\r\nseeds, and the action of roots and leaves, as it is for our maintenance of\r\nlife. It is hurtful for plants to be kept with too much water about their\r\nroots, because this keeps out the air. This is the reason why house-plants\r\nare injured if they are kept too wet.\r\n\r\nA secondary office of root-hairs is to aid the roots of seedlings to enter\r\nthe ground, as we have before noticed.\r\n\r\nThe root-hairs are found only on the young parts of roots. As a root grows\r\nolder the root-hairs die, and it becomes of no further use for absorption.\r\nBut it is needed now for another purpose, as the support of the growing\r\nplant. In trees, the old roots grow from year to year like stems, and\r\nbecome large and strong. The extent of the roots corresponds in a general\r\nway to that of the branches, and, as the absorbing parts are the young\r\nrootlets, the rain that drops from the leafy roof falls just where it is\r\nneeded by the delicate fibrils in the earth below.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. VI. The Relative Positions of Leaves and\r\nRootlets.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Comparison of a Carrot, an Onion, and a Potato_.--It is a good\r\nexercise for a class to take a potato, an onion, and a carrot or radish to\r\ncompare, writing out the result of their observations.\r\n\r\nThe carrot is a fleshy root, as we have already seen. The onion consists\r\nof the fleshy bases of last year\'s leaves, sheathed by the dried remains\r\nof the leaves of former years, from which all nourishment has been drawn.\r\nThe parallel veining of the leaves is distinctly marked. The stem is a\r\nplate at the base, to which these fleshy scales are attached. In the\r\ncentre, or in the axils of the scales, the newly-forming bulbs can be\r\nseen, in onions that are sprouting. If possible, compare other bulbs, as\r\nthose of Tulip, Hyacinth, or Snowdrop, and the bulb of a Crocus, in which\r\nthe fleshy part consists of the thickened base of the stem, and the leaves\r\nare merely dry scales. This is called a _corm_.\r\n\r\nThe potato is a thickened stem. It shows itself to be a stem, because it\r\nbears organs. The leaves are reduced to little scales (eyelids), in the\r\naxils of which come the buds (eyes). The following delightful experiment\r\nhas been recommended to me.\r\n\r\nIn a growing potato plant, direct upwards one of the low shoots and\r\nsurround it with a little cylinder of stiff carpet paper, stuffed with\r\nsphagnum and loam. Cut away the other tuber-disposed shoots as they\r\nappear. The enclosed shoot develops into a tuber which stands more or less\r\nvertical, and the scales become pretty little leaves. Removing the paper,\r\nthe tuber and leaves become green, and the latter enlarge a little. A\r\nbetter illustration of the way in which organs adapt themselves to their\r\nconditions, and of the meaning of morphology, could hardly be found.\r\n\r\n_Gray\'s First Lessons_. Sect. v, 65-88. _How Plants Grow_. Chap. I, 83-90.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nBUDS AND BRANCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. There is an astonishing amount to be learned from naked branches,\r\nand, if pursued in the right way, the study will be found exceedingly\r\ninteresting. Professor Beal, in his pamphlet on the New Botany,[1] says:--\r\n\r\n"Before the first lesson, each pupil is furnished or told where to procure\r\nsome specimen for study. If it is winter, and flowers or growing plants\r\ncannot be had, give each a branch of a tree or shrub; this branch may be\r\ntwo feet long. The examination of these is made during the usual time for\r\npreparing lessons, and not while the class is before the teacher. For the\r\nfirst recitation each is to tell what he has discovered. The specimens are\r\nnot in sight during the recitation. In learning the lesson, books are not\r\nused; for, if they are used, no books will contain a quarter of what the\r\npupil may see for himself. If there is time, each member of the class is\r\nallowed a chance to mention anything not named by any of the rest. The\r\nteacher may suggest a few other points for study. The pupils are not told\r\nwhat they can see for themselves. An effort is made to keep them working\r\nafter something which they have not yet discovered. If two members\r\ndisagree on any point, on the next day, after further study, they are\r\nrequested to bring in all the proofs they can to sustain their different\r\nconclusions. For a second lesson, the students review the first lesson,\r\nand report on a branch of a tree of another species which they have\r\nstudied as before. Now they notice any point of difference or of\r\nsimilarity. In like manner new branches are studied and new comparisons\r\nmade. For this purpose, naked branches of our species of elms, maples,\r\nashes, oaks, basswood, beech, poplars, willows, walnut, butternut,\r\nhawthorns, cherries, and in fact any of our native or exotic trees or\r\nshrubs are suitable. A comparison of the branches of any of the evergreens\r\nis interesting and profitable. Discoveries, very unexpected, are almost\r\nsure to reward a patient study of these objects. The teacher must not\r\nthink time is wasted. No real progress can be made, till the pupils begin\r\nto learn to see; and to learn to see they must keep trying to form the\r\nhabit from the very first; and to form the habit they should make the\r\nstudy of specimens the main feature in the course of training."\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The New Botany. By W.J. Beal. Philadelphia, C.H. Marot, 814\r\nChestnut St., 1882. Page 5.]\r\n\r\nHORSECHESTNUT (_\xc3\x86sculus Hippocastanum_).\r\n\r\nWe will begin with the study of a branch of Horsechestnut.[1] The pupils\r\nshould examine and describe their specimens before discussing them in the\r\nclass-room. They will need some directions and hints, however, to enable\r\nthem to work to any advantage. Tell them to open both large and small\r\nbuds. It is not advisable to study the Horsechestnut bud by cutting\r\nsections, as the wool is so dense that the arrangement cannot be seen in\r\nthis way. The scales should be removed with a knife, one by one, and the\r\nnumber, texture, etc., noted. The leaves and flower-cluster will remain\r\nuncovered and will be easy to examine. The gum may be first removed by\r\npressing the bud in a bit of paper. The scholars should study carefully\r\nthe markings on the stem, in order to explain, if possible, what has\r\ncaused them. The best way to make clear the meaning of the scars is to\r\nshow them the relation of the bud to the branch. They must define a bud.\r\nAsk them what the bud would have become the next season, if it had been\r\nallowed to develop. It would have been a branch, or a part of one. A bud,\r\nthen, is an undeveloped branch. They can always work out this definition\r\nfor themselves. Conversely, a branch is a developed bud, or series of\r\nbuds, and every mark on the branch must correspond to something in the\r\nbud. Let them examine the specimens with this idea clearly before their\r\nminds. The lesson to prepare should be to write out all they can observe\r\nand to make careful drawings of their specimens. Ask them to find a way,\r\nif possible, to tell the age of the branch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The pupils should cut their names on their branches and keep\r\nthem. They will need them constantly for comparison and reference.]\r\n\r\nAt the recitation, the papers can be read and the points mentioned\r\nthoroughly discussed. This will take two lesson-hours, probably, and the\r\ndrawing may be left, if desired, as the exercise to prepare for the second\r\nrecitation.\r\n\r\n[1]The buds of Horsechestnut contain the plan of the whole growth of the\r\nnext season. They are scaly and covered, especially towards the apex, with\r\na sticky varnish. The scales are opposite, like the leaves. The outer\r\npairs are wholly brown and leathery, the succeeding ones tipped with\r\nbrown, wherever exposed, so that the whole bud is covered with a thick\r\ncoat. The inner scales are green and delicate, and somewhat woolly,\r\nespecially along the lapping edges. There are about seven pairs of\r\nscales. The larger terminal buds have a flower-cluster in the centre, and\r\ngenerally two pairs of leaves; the small buds contain leaves alone, two or\r\nthree pairs of them. The leaves are densely covered with white wool, to\r\nprotect them from the sudden changes of winter. The use of the gum is to\r\nward off moisture. The flower-cluster is woolly also.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: All descriptions are made from specimens examined by me.\r\nOther specimens may differ in some points. Plants vary in different\r\nsituations and localities.]\r\n\r\nThe scars on the stem are of three kinds, leaf, bud-scale, and\r\nflower-cluster scars. The pupils should notice that the buds are always\r\njust above the large triangular scars. If they are still in doubt as to\r\nthe cause of these marks, show them some house-plant with well-developed\r\nbuds in the axils of the leaves, and ask them to compare the position of\r\nthese buds with their branches. The buds that spring from the inner angle\r\nof the leaf with the stem are _axillary_ buds; those that crown the stems\r\nare _terminal_. Since a bud is an undeveloped branch, terminal buds carry,\r\non the axis which they crown, axillary buds give rise to side-shoots. The\r\nleaf-scars show the leaf-arrangement and the number of leaves each year.\r\nThe leaves are opposite and each pair stands over the intervals of the\r\npair below. The same is observed to be true of the scales and leaves\r\nof the bud.[1] All these points should be brought out by the actual\r\nobservation of the specimens by the pupils, with only such hints from the\r\nteacher as may be needed to direct their attention aright. The dots on the\r\nleaf-scar are the ends of woody bundles (fibro-vascular bundles) which, in\r\nautumn, separated from the leaf. By counting these we can tell how many\r\nleaflets there were in the leaf, three, five, seven, nine, or occasionally\r\nsix or eight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Bud-scales are modified leaves and their arrangement is\r\ntherefore the same as the leaves. This is not mentioned in the study of\r\nthe Horsechestnut bud, because it cannot be proved to the pupils, but the\r\ntransition is explained in connection with Lilac, where it may be clearly\r\nseen. The scales of the bud of Horsechestnut are considered to be\r\nhomologous with petioles, by analogy with other members of the same\r\nfamily. In the Sweet Buckeye a series can be made, exhibiting the gradual\r\nchange from a scale to a compound leaf. See the Botanical Text-Book, Part\r\nI, Structural Botany. By Asa Gray. Ivison, Blakeman, Taylor and Co., New\r\nYork, 1879. Plate 233, p. 116.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Horsechestnut. I. Branch in winter state: _a_,\r\nleaf-scars; _b_, bud-scars; _c_, flower-scars. 2. An expanding leaf-bud.\r\n3. Same, more advanced.]\r\n\r\n_The Bud Scale-Scars_. These are rings left by the scales of the bud and\r\nmay be seen in many branches. They are well seen in Horsechestnut. If the\r\npupils have failed to observe that these rings show the position of former\r\nbuds and mark the growth of successive years, this point must be brought\r\nout by skilful questioning. There is a difference in the color of the more\r\nrecent shoots, and a pupil, when asked how much of his branch grew the\r\npreceding season, will be able to answer by observing the change in color.\r\nMake him see that this change corresponds with the rings, and he will\r\nunderstand how to tell every year\'s growth. Then ask what would make the\r\nrings in a branch produced from one of his buds, and he can hardly fail to\r\nsee that the scales would make them. When the scholars understand that the\r\nrings mark the year\'s growth, they can count them and ascertain the age\r\nof each branch. The same should be done with each side-shoot. Usually the\r\nnumbers will be found to agree; that is, all the buds will have the\r\nsame number of rings between them and the cut end of the branch, but\r\noccasionally a bud will remain latent for one or several seasons and then\r\nbegin its growth, in which case the numbers will not agree; the difference\r\nwill be the number of years it remained latent. There are always many buds\r\nthat are not developed. "The undeveloped buds do not necessarily perish,\r\nbut are ready to be called into action in case the others are checked.\r\nWhen the stronger buds are destroyed, some that would else remain dormant\r\ndevelop in their stead, incited by the abundance of nourishment which the\r\nformer would have monopolized. In this manner our trees are soon reclothed\r\nwith verdure, after their tender foliage and branches have been killed by\r\na late vernal frost, or consumed by insects. And buds which have remained\r\nlatent for several years occasionally shoot forth into branches from the\r\nsides of old stems, especially in certain trees."[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Structural Botany, p. 48.]\r\n\r\nThe pupils can measure the distance between each set of rings on the main\r\nstem, to see on what years it grew best.\r\n\r\n_The Flower-Cluster Scars_. These are the round, somewhat concave, scars,\r\nfound terminating the stem where forking occurs, or seemingly in the\r\naxils of branches, on account of one of the forking branches growing more\r\nrapidly and stoutly than the other and thus taking the place of the main\r\nstem, so that this is apparently continued without interruption. If the\r\npupils have not understood the cause of the flower-cluster scars, show\r\nthem their position in shoots where they are plainly on the summit of the\r\nstem, and tell them to compare this with the arrangement of a large\r\nbud. The flower-cluster terminates the axis in the bud, and this scar\r\nterminates a branch. When the terminal bud is thus prevented from\r\ncontinuing its growth, the nearest axillary buds are developed.[1] One\r\nshoot usually gets the start, and becomes so much stronger that it throws\r\nthe other to one side. The tendency of the Horsechestnut to have its\r\ngrowth carried on by the terminal buds is so strong that I almost feel\r\ninclined to say that vigorous branches are never formed from axillary\r\nbuds, in old trees, except where the terminal bud has been prevented from\r\ncontinuing the branch. This tendency gives to the tree its characteristic\r\nsize of trunk and branches, and lack of delicate spray. On looking closely\r\nat the branches also, they will be seen to be quite irregular, wherever\r\nthere has been a flower-cluster swerving to one side or the other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The first winter that I examined Horsechestnut buds I found,\r\nin many cases, that the axillary shoots had from a quarter of an inch to\r\nan inch of wood before the first set of rings. I could not imagine what\r\nhad formed this wood, and it remained a complete puzzle to me until the\r\nfollowing spring, when I found in the expanding shoots, that, wherever\r\na flower-cluster was present, there were one or two pairs of leaflets\r\nalready well developed in the axils, and that the next season\'s buds were\r\nforming between them, while the internodes of these leaflets were making\r\nquite a rapid growth. Subsequently, I found the leaflets also in the buds\r\nthemselves. I found these leaflets developed on the tree only in the\r\nshoots containing flower-clusters, where they would be needed for the\r\nfuture growth of the branches. I suppose the reason must be that the\r\nflower-cluster does not use all the nourishment provided and that\r\ntherefore the axillary buds are able to develop. It would be interesting\r\nto know what determines the stronger growth of the one which eventually\r\nbecomes the leader.]\r\n\r\nThere is one thing more the pupils may have noticed. The small round dots\r\nall over the young stem, which become long rifts in the older parts, are\r\nbreaks in the epidermis, or skin of the stem, through which the inner\r\nlayers of bark protrude. They are called lenticels. They provide a passage\r\nfor gases in and out of the stem. In some trees, as the Birch, they are\r\nvery noticeable.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the subject thoroughly in the class-room, the pupils\r\nshould rewrite their papers, and finally answer the following questions,\r\nas a species of review. I have thus spent three recitations on the\r\nHorsechestnut. The work is all so new, and, if properly presented,\r\nso interesting, that a good deal of time is required to exhaust its\r\npossibilities of instruction. If the teacher finds his scholars wearying,\r\nhowever, he can leave as many of the details as he pleases to be treated\r\nin connection with other branches.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE HORSECHESTNUT.\r\n\r\nHow many scales are there in the buds you have examined?\r\n\r\nHow are they arranged?\r\n\r\nHow many leaves are there in the buds?\r\n\r\nHow are they arranged?\r\n\r\nWhere does the flower-cluster come in the bud?\r\n\r\nDo all the buds contain flower-clusters?\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of the wool and the gum?\r\n\r\nWhere do the buds come on the stem?\r\n\r\nWhich are the strongest?\r\n\r\nHow are the leaves arranged on the stem?\r\n\r\nDo the pairs stand directly over each other?\r\n\r\nWhat are the dots on the leaf-scars?\r\n\r\nHow old is your branch?\r\n\r\nHow old is each twig?\r\n\r\nWhich years were the best for growth?\r\n\r\nWhere were the former flower-clusters?\r\n\r\nWhat happens when a branch is stopped in its growth by flowering?\r\n\r\nWhat effect does this have on the appearance of the tree?\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country the Horsechestnut is not so commonly planted\r\nas in New England. In the southern states the Magnolia may be used in its\r\nstead, but it is not nearly so simple an example of the main points to be\r\nobserved.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. VII. Trees in Winter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNOLIA UMBRELLA.\r\n\r\nThe bud may be examined by removing the scales with a knife, as in\r\nHorsechestnut, and also by cutting sections. The outer scales enfold the\r\nwhole bud, and each succeeding pair cover all within. They are joined,\r\nand it is frequently difficult to tell where the suture is, though it can\r\ngenerally be traced at the apex of the bud. On the back is a thick\r\nstalk, which is the base of the leaf-stalk. Remove the scales by cutting\r\ncarefully through a single pair, opposite the leaf-stalk, and peeling\r\nthem off. The scales are modified stipules, instead of leaf-stalks, as in\r\nHorsechestnut. The outer pair are brown and thick, the inner green, and\r\nbecoming more delicate and crumpled as we proceed toward the centre of the\r\nbud. The leaves begin with the second or third pair of scales. The first\r\none or two are imperfect, being small, brown, and dry. The leaves grow\r\nlarger towards the centre of the bud. They are covered with short,\r\nsilky hairs, and are folded lengthwise, with the inner surface within\r\n(_conduplicate_). In the specimens I have examined I do not see much\r\ndifference in size between the buds with flowers and those without. In\r\nevery bud examined which contained a flower, there was an axillary bud in\r\nthe axil of the last, or next to the last, leaf. This bud is to continue\r\nthe interrupted branch in the same way as in Horsechestnut.\r\n\r\nThere are from six to ten good leaves, in the buds that I have seen. Those\r\nwithout flowers contain more leaves, as in Horsechestnut. In the centre of\r\nthese buds the leaves are small and undeveloped. The flower is very easy\r\nto examine, the floral envelopes, stamens and pistils, being plainly\r\ndiscernible. The bud may also be studied in cross-section. This shows the\r\nwhole arrangement. The plan is not so simple as in Horsechestnut, where\r\nthe leaves are opposite. The subject of leaf-arrangement should be passed\r\nover until phyllotaxy is taken up.\r\n\r\nThe scars on the stem differ from Horsechestnut in having no distinct\r\nbands of rings. The scales, being stipules, leave a line on each side of\r\nthe leaf-scar, and these are separated by the growth of the internodes.\r\nIn the Beech, the scales are also stipules; but, whereas in the Magnolia\r\nthere are only one or two abortive leaves, in the Beech there are eight or\r\nnine pairs of stipules without any leaves at all. The rings thus become\r\nseparated in Magnolia, while in the Beech the first internodes are not\r\ndeveloped, leaving a distinct band of rings, to mark the season\'s growth.\r\nThe Magnolia is therefore less desirable to begin upon. The branches are\r\nswollen at the beginning of a new growth, and have a number of leaf-scars\r\ncrowded closely together. The leaf-scars are roundish, the lower line more\r\ncurved. They have many dots on them. From each leaf-scar runs an irregular\r\nline around the stem. This has been left by the stipules.\r\n\r\nThe flower-scar is on the summit of the axis, and often apparently in the\r\naxil of a branch, as in Horsechestnut. Sometimes the nearest axillary bud\r\nis developed; sometimes there are two, when the branch forks. The axillary\r\nbuds seldom grow unless the terminal bud is interrupted. The tree\r\ntherefore has no fine spray.\r\n\r\n\r\nLILAC _(Syringa vulgaris_).\r\n\r\nAsk the scholars to write a description of their branches and to compare\r\nthem with Horsechestnut. These papers should be prepared before coming\r\ninto the class, as before.\r\n\r\nThe buds are four-sided. The scales and leaves are opposite, as in\r\nHorsechestnut. The outer pair sometimes have buds in their axils. Remove\r\nthe scales one by one with a knife, or better, with a stout needle. The\r\nscales gradually become thinner as we proceed, and pass into leaves, so\r\nthat we cannot tell where the scales end and leaves begin. After about six\r\npairs are removed, we come, in the larger buds, to leaves with axillary\r\nflower-clusters. The leaves grow smaller and the flower-clusters\r\nlarger till we come to the centre, where the axis is terminated by a\r\nflower-cluster. There is a great difference in the buds on different\r\nbushes and on shoots of the same bush, some being large, green, and easy\r\nto examine, others small, hard, and dark-colored. It is better, of course,\r\nto select as soft and large buds as possible for examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Lilac. I. Branch in winter state: _a_, leaf-scar;\r\n_b_, bud-scar (reduced). 2. Same, less reduced. 3. Branch, with leaf-buds\r\nexpanded. 4. Series in a single bud, showing the gradual transition from\r\nscales to leaves.]\r\n\r\nThat the scales are modified leaves is plainly shown by the gradual\r\ntransition they undergo, and also by the fact that buds are developed in\r\ntheir axils. If any of these can be shown to the pupils, remind them of\r\nthe experiment where the top of a seedling Pea was cut off and buds forced\r\nto develop in the axils of the lower scales.[1] The transition from scales\r\nto leaves can be well studied by bringing branches into the house, where\r\nthey will develop in water, and towards spring may even be made to\r\nblossom. Cherry, Apple, Forsythia, and other blossoming trees and shrubs\r\ncan be thus forced to bloom. Place the branches in hot water, and cut off\r\na little of their ends under water. If the water is changed every day,\r\nand the glass kept near the register or stove, they will blossom out very\r\nquickly. These expanded shoots may be compared with the buds. The number\r\nof leaves in the bud varies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See p. 31.]\r\n\r\nThe leaf-scars of Lilac are horseshoe-shaped and somewhat swollen. It can\r\noften be plainly seen that the outer tissue of the stem runs up into the\r\nscar. It looks as if there were a layer of bark, ending with the scar,\r\nfastened over each side of the stem. These apparent layers alternate as\r\nwell as the scars. The epidermis, or skin of the leaves, is in fact always\r\ncontinuous with that of the stem. There are no dots on the leaf-scars.\r\n\r\nThe rings are not nearly so noticeable as in Horsechestnut, but they can\r\nbe counted for some years back.\r\n\r\nThe flower-cluster can often be traced by a dried bit of stem remaining on\r\nthe branch.\r\n\r\nThe terminal bud in the Lilac does not usually develop, and the two\r\nuppermost axillary buds take its place, giving to the shrub the forked\r\ncharacter of its branching. In all these bud studies, the pupil should\r\nfinish by showing how the arrangement of the buds determines the growth of\r\nthe branches.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE LILAC.\r\n\r\nHow do the scales differ from those of Horsechestnut?\r\n\r\nHow many scales and leaves are there?\r\n\r\nHow are they arranged?\r\n\r\nWhere does the flower-cluster come in the bud?\r\n\r\nDo all the buds contain flower-clusters?\r\n\r\nHow does the arrangement of leaves and flower-clusters differ from that of\r\nHorsechestnut?\r\n\r\nHow old is your branch?\r\n\r\nWhich buds develop most frequently?\r\n\r\nHow does this affect the appearance of the shrub?\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER BEECH (_Fagus sylvatica, var. purpurea_).\r\n\r\nThe buds are long and tapering, the scales thin and scarious, the outer\r\nnaked, the inner with long, silky hairs. Remove the scales one by one, as\r\nin Lilac. The outer four or six pairs are so minute that the arrangement\r\nis not very clear, but as we proceed we perceive that the scales are in\r\nalternate pairs, as in Horsechestnut; that is, that two scales are exactly\r\non the same plane. But we have learned in the Lilac that the scales are\r\nmodified leaves, and follow the leaf-arrangement of the species. The\r\nBeech is alternate-leaved, and we should therefore expect the scales to\r\nalternate. The explanation is found as we go on removing the scales. At\r\nthe eighth or ninth pair we come upon a tiny, silky leaf, directly between\r\nthe pair of scales, and, removing these, another larger leaf, opposite the\r\nfirst but higher up on the rudimentary stem, and so on, with the rest of\r\nthe bud. There are five or more leaves, each placed between a pair of\r\nscales. Our knowledge of the parts of a leaf shows us at once that the\r\nscales must be modified stipules, and that therefore they must be in\r\npairs.[1] Other examples of scales homologous with stipules are the\r\nAmerican Elm, Tulip-tree, Poplar and Magnolia. The leaves are plaited\r\non the veins and covered with long, silky hairs. The venation is very\r\ndistinct. The outer leaves are smaller and, on examining the branch, it\r\nwill be seen that their internodes do not make so large a growth as the\r\nleaves in the centre of the bud.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See the stipules of the Pea, p. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Copper Beech. 1. Branch in winter state: _a_,\r\nleaf-scar; _b_, bud-scar. 2. Branch, with leaf-buds expanding, showing the\r\nplicate folding of the leaves.]\r\n\r\nThe leaf-scars are small, soon becoming merely ridges running half round\r\nthe stem.\r\n\r\nThe bud-rings are very plain and easily counted. For this reason, and\r\nbecause it branches freely, it is a good tree for measurements of growth,\r\nas is seen in the following tables. Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4: were made by a\r\nclass of girls, from fourteen to sixteen, from a tree on my lawn. No. 5\r\nwas made by a pupil, whom I taught by correspondence, from a tree of the\r\nsame species in another town. No. 6 was made by myself from my own tree.\r\nThe measurements of the first four tables were somewhat revised by me, as\r\nthey were not perfectly accurate. The pupils should always be cautioned\r\nto measure from the beginning of one set of rings to the beginning of the\r\nnext.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Care must be taken to select branches well exposed to the\r\nlight. Of course there are many circumstances that may aid or hinder the\r\ngrowth of any particular branch.]\r\n\r\nNO. 1.\r\n\r\nYEARS.

It\r\nappears in these tables that there is a general correspondence, in this\r\ntree at least. In the recitation of the class, whose tables are given\r\nabove (Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4), we took all the measurements of these four\r\nbranches for the year 1885 and added them. We did the same for 1886, and\r\ncompared the results. The total growth for 1885 was 31-15/16 inches; for\r\n1886, leaving out the measurement of the twig whose entire growth was in\r\nthat year, 109-3/4 inches or nearly 3-1/2 times as much. The proportion\r\nheld in a general way throughout, there being only a single case of a\r\nbranch where the growth was greater in the first year.[1] But there is a\r\npoint that must not be overlooked in this connection. The branches of the\r\nBeech seem to grow about equally well in the first, second, third, or any\r\nsucceeding year. In some trees, as the Ash, the axillary buds make a large\r\ngrowth, and the succeeding terminal buds carry on the branch much more\r\nslowly; in other trees, as the Cherry, a branch grows very slowly in the\r\nfirst few years and then suddenly takes a start. These facts would appear\r\nin tables of growth, made from branches of these trees, but the addition\r\nof results for any particular year would have no significance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The spring of 1880 was a remarkably early one. Thus I find in\r\nmy diary of that year the following entries:--\r\n\r\nApril 17. The red maples are in full bloom, the elms almost over. The\r\nleaves of the Horsechestnut are quite large. The lilacs are nearly in\r\nleaf. April 24. We went up to Waverley and found bloodroot up, spice bush\r\nout, violets, dog-tooths and anemones, also caltha. April 28. All the\r\ncherries are in full bloom. April 29. Picked an apple blossom in bud,\r\nbeautifully pink.\r\n\r\nThe season was nearly three weeks earlier than usual. 1885 on the other\r\nhand was a late spring.]\r\n\r\nIn table No. 5, the addition of the measurements for 1885 and 1886 shows\r\nthe growth in the latter year to be about twice that of the former. This\r\nbranch came from a tree in another town. We have tried also to discover\r\nwhether the number of leaves each year has any relation to growth. I\r\ncannot see that it has, but it requires many experiments to determine\r\nthese points. To study this, make tables of the number of leaves on the\r\nbranch each year. I think teachers would find it interesting to keep all\r\ndata of this kind of work done by their classes, with a view to tabulation\r\nand comparison. The scholars themselves are exceedingly interested in\r\nanything that partakes of the nature of an original investigation.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The class, previously mentioned, were much interested in the\r\naddition of their results. One of them asked me whether this subject of\r\nmeasurements had been treated in any book. I replied that I had never seen\r\nit mentioned. My attention was afterwards called to "What may be learned\r\nfrom a Tree," by Prof. Harlan Couitas. D. Appleton & Co., New York, 1863.\r\nI found, greatly to my surprise, that he had not only given diagrams of\r\ngrowth, but that he also had selected a Copper Beech as his example.]\r\n\r\nThe leaf-arrangement of the Beech is alternate, on the one-half plan. The\r\nsmall twigs turn upwards, so that all the spray is on the upper side,\r\ngiving a flat appearance to the branch.[1] This gives the leaves a better\r\nexposure to the light. Both the terminal and axillary buds grow freely,\r\nthus forming long, straight limbs, with many branches and much fine spray.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Phyllotaxy is treated later, by a comparison and study of\r\nmany branches, but the teacher can draw the pupils\' attention to the fact\r\nthat each Beech leaf and twig is on exactly the opposite side of the\r\nbranch from the preceding one. This allows all the twigs to grow towards\r\none side of the branch, whereas in trees on the two-fifths plan, as the\r\nApple, Poplar, Oak, etc., no such regularity would be possible, on account\r\nof their many different angles with the stem.]\r\n\r\nThe bark of the Beech is beautifully smooth. The extreme straightness of\r\nthe trunk and limbs is very striking, and may be compared to the crooked\r\nlimbs of the Horsechestnut, where the branch is continually interrupted by\r\nthe flower-cluster. In the Beech the flowers are axillary.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE BEECH.\r\n\r\nHow are the scales of the Beech bud arranged?\r\n\r\nHow many leaves are there in the bud?\r\n\r\nHow does the arrangement of the scales and leaves in the bud differ from\r\nthat of the Horsechestnut?\r\n\r\nHow are the leaves folded in the bud?\r\n\r\nWhat is the arrangement of the leaves on the stem?\r\n\r\nHow does this differ from Horsechestnut and Lilac?\r\n\r\nHow old is your branch?\r\n\r\nHow old is each twig?\r\n\r\nWhat years were the best for growth?\r\n\r\nHow does the growth of the branches differ from that of Horsechestnut?\r\nFrom Lilac?\r\n\r\nExplain these differences with reference to the growth and arrangement of\r\nthe buds?\r\n\r\nIn what direction do the twigs grow?\r\n\r\nHow does this affect the appearance of the tree?\r\n\r\nCompare the amount of spray of the Beech and Horsechestnut and explain the\r\nreason of the difference.\r\n\r\nThese questions are only intended for review, they are never to be used\r\nfor the first study of the specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN ELM (_Ulmus Americana_).\r\n\r\nThe buds are covered with brown scales, which are hairy on the edges. The\r\nflower-buds are larger than the leaf-buds and are in the axils of the\r\nlower leaves of the preceding year. Each leaf in the bud is enclosed by\r\na pair of scales. They are so small that the pupils, unused to delicate\r\nwork, will hardly discover them. Under a glass they can be seen to be\r\novate, folded on the midrib with the inner face within (_conduplicate_),\r\nand with an ovate scale joined to the base of the leaf on either side. The\r\nscales thus show themselves to be modified stipules. The venation of the\r\nleaves is very plain. The scales are much larger than the leaves. The\r\nflower-buds contain a cluster of flowers, on slender green pedicels. The\r\ncalyx is bell-shaped, unequal, and lobed. The stamens and pistil can\r\nbe seen. The flower-clusters do not seem to leave any mark which is\r\ndistinguishable from the leaf-scar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--American Elm. 1. Branch in winter state: _a_,\r\nleaf-scars; _b_, bud-scars; _d_, leaf-buds; _e_, flower-buds. 2. Branch,\r\nwith staminate flower-buds expanding. 3. Same, more advanced. 4. Branch,\r\nwith pistillate flowers, the leaf-bud also expanding.]\r\n\r\nThe leaf-scars are small and extend about half around the stem. The\r\narrangement is alternate on the one-half plan. There are three dots on the\r\nscar.\r\n\r\nThe rings are quite plain. The tree can be used to make tables of growth,\r\nlike those of the Beech.\r\n\r\nThe buds will probably be too small for examination by the pupils, at\r\npresent, but their position and development can be studied, and are very\r\ninstructive. As the leaf-buds are all on the ends of the branchlets, the\r\ntwigs and branches will be just below the bud-rings, and then there will\r\nbe a space where no twigs nor branches will be found, till the next set\r\nof rings is reached. This gives the branches more room to develop\r\nsymmetrically. The terminal buds do not develop in the Elm, in old trees,\r\nthe bud axillary to the last leaf of the season taking its place, and most\r\nof the other axillary buds growing also. This makes the tree break out\r\ninto very fine spray. A tree like the Elm, where the trunk becomes lost in\r\nthe branches, is called _deliquescent_; when the trunk is continued to the\r\ntop of the tree, as in the Spruce, it is _excurrent_.\r\n\r\nThe small, feathery twigs and branches that are often seen on the trunks\r\nand great limbs of the elm grow from buds which are produced anywhere on\r\nthe surface of the wood. Such buds are called _adventitious_ buds. They\r\noften spring from a tree when it is wounded.\r\n\r\n"The American elm is, in most parts of the state, the most magnificent\r\ntree to be seen. From a root, which, in old trees, spreads much above\r\nthe surface of the ground, the trunk rises to a considerable height in a\r\nsingle stem. Here it usually divides into two or three principal branches,\r\nwhich go off by a gradual and easy curve. Theses stretch upwards and\r\noutwards with an airy sweep, become horizontal, the extreme half of the\r\nlimb, pendent, forming a light and regular arch. This graceful curvature,\r\nand absence of all abruptness, in the primary limbs and forks, and all the\r\nsubsequent divisions, are entirely characteristic of the tree, and enable\r\nan observer to distinguish it in the winter and even by night, when\r\nstanding in relief against the sky, as far as it can be distinctly\r\nseen."[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A Report on the Trees and Shrubs growing naturally in the\r\nForests of Massachusetts. By Geo. B. Emerson, Boston, Little, Brown and\r\nCo., 1875.\r\n\r\nThis book will be found very useful, containing careful descriptions of\r\nmany trees and shrubs, and interesting facts about them.]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE AMERICAN ELM.\r\n\r\nHow do the flower-buds differ from the leaf-buds in position and\r\nappearance?\r\n\r\nWhat is the arrangement of the leaves?\r\n\r\nWhat other tree that you have studied has this arrangement?\r\n\r\nHow old is your branch?\r\n\r\nWhere would you look to see if the flower-cluster had left any mark?\r\n\r\nWhy is it that several twigs grow near each other, and that then comes a\r\nspace without any branches?\r\n\r\nWhat buds develop most frequently?\r\n\r\nHow does this affect the appearance of the tree?\r\n\r\nWhat is a tree called when the trunk is lost in the branches?\r\n\r\n\r\nBALM OF GILEAD (_Populus balsamifera, var. candicans_).\r\n\r\nThe buds are pointed: the terminal slightly angled, the axillary flattened\r\nagainst the stem.[1] Some of the axillary buds contain leaves and some\r\nflowers; the appearance of the leaf-buds and flower-buds being the same.\r\nThe scales of the bud are modified stipules. The terminal buds have about\r\nthree pairs of the outer scales brown and leathery. The inner scales, as\r\nwell as the leaves, are coated with resinous matter, which has a strong\r\nodor and a nauseous taste. The smaller outer scales have no corresponding\r\nleaf, and apparently are modified stipules of the leaves of the preceding\r\nyear, but the larger ones have a leaf to each pair of scales. The outer\r\nand inner leaves are small, the middle ones larger. Comparing the branch,\r\nit will be seen that these leaves make the largest growth of internode.\r\nThe leaves are rolled towards the midrib on the upper face (_involute_).\r\nThere are about ten which are easily seen and counted, the inner ones\r\nbeing very small, with minute scales. The axillary buds have a short\r\nthick scale on the outer part of the bud, then about three pairs of large\r\nscales, each succeeding one enwrapping those within, the outer one brown\r\nand leathery. The scales of the flower-buds are somewhat gummy, but not\r\nnearly so much so as those of the leaf-buds. Within is the catkin. Each\r\npistil, or stamen (they are on separate trees, _dioecious_) is in a little\r\ncup and covered by a scale, which is cut and fringed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: These buds cannot be satisfactorily examined in cross\r\nsection, on account of the resin. The scales must be removed one by one,\r\nwith a knife, with a complete disregard of the effect upon the hands.]\r\n\r\nThe leaf-scars are somewhat three-lobed on the young parts, with three\r\ndots, indicating the fibro-vascular bundles, which ran up into the leaf.\r\nThe scars are swollen, making the young branches exceedingly rough. In\r\nthe older parts the scars become less noticeable. Strong young shoots,\r\nespecially those which come up from the root, are strongly angled,\r\nwith three ridges running up into each leaf-scar, making them almost\r\nclub-shaped. There are often from twenty to thirty leaves in one year\'s\r\ngrowth, in such shoots, and all the leaves are not rudimentary in the bud.\r\nThe growth in this case is said to be _indefinite_. Usually in trees with\r\nscaly buds the plan of the whole year\'s growth is laid down in the bud,\r\nand the term _definite_ is applied. Branches, like the Rose, that go on\r\ngrowing all summer grow indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe bud-scale scar is quite different from the other trees which we have\r\nexamined. It is not composed of definite rings, but of leaf-scars with\r\nlong ridges running from each side of them, showing the scales to be\r\nmodified stipules. The leaf-scars have become somewhat separated by the\r\ngrowth of the internodes. In the Beech, there are eight, or more, pairs of\r\nscales with no leaves, so that the internodes do not develop, and a ring\r\nis left on the branch.\r\n\r\nThe flower-cluster leaves a concave, semicircular scar, in the leaf-axil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Balm-of-Gilead. 1. Branch in winter state: _a_,\r\nleaf-scar; _b_, bud-scar. 2. Branch, with leaf-buds expanded. 3. Branch,\r\nwith catkin appearing from the bud.]\r\n\r\nThe terminal buds are the strongest and not very many axillary buds\r\ndevelop, so that the tree has not fine spray.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-arrangement is alternate, on the 2/5 plan. Phyllotaxy is not yet\r\nto be taken up, but the pupils should be shown the different angles of the\r\nbranching of the twigs, and told to compare them with Beech and Elm.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE BALM OF GILEAD.\r\n\r\nIn which buds are the flower-clusters?\r\n\r\nAre there flowers and leaves in the same buds?\r\n\r\nWhat are the scales of the bud?\r\n\r\nHow are the leaves folded in the bud?\r\n\r\nHow do the axillary and terminal buds differ?\r\n\r\nWhat are the dots on the leaf-scars?\r\n\r\nWhy is there no distinct band of rings as in Beech?\r\n\r\nHow old is your branch?\r\n\r\nWhere do you look for flower-cluster scars?\r\n\r\nWhich buds are the strongest?\r\n\r\nHow does this affect the appearance of the tree?\r\n\r\nWhat makes the ends of the branches so rough?\r\n\r\nCompare the arrangement of the twigs and branches with Beech and Elm, with\r\nHorsechestnut and Lilac.\r\n\r\n\r\nTULIP-TREE (_Liriodendron Tulipifera_).\r\n\r\nThe buds are small, flat, and rounded at the apex. They are sheathed by\r\nscales, each leaf being covered by a pair, whose edges cohere. The outer\r\npair are brown and are the stipules of the last leaf of the preceding\r\nyear. The leaves are conduplicate, as in Magnolia, and have the blade bent\r\ninwards on the petiole (_inflexed_). Their shape is very clearly to be\r\nseen, and no bud is more interesting in the closeness of its packing.\r\nAxillary buds are often found within. The flowers grow high upon the trees\r\nand towards the ends of the branches.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-scars are round with many dots. The scar of the stipules is a\r\ncontinuous line around the stem, as in Magnolia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRY _(Prunus Cerasus_).\r\n\r\nThe leaf-buds are terminal, or in the axils of the upper leaves of the\r\npreceding year; the flower buds are axillary. There is but one bud in each\r\naxil, and usually two or three flowers in each bud, but the leaves on\r\nthe twigs are crowded and the flowers therefore appear in clusters. The\r\nblossom-buds are larger and more rounded than the leaf-buds.\r\n\r\nThe buds of the tree develop very easily in the house, and as they are\r\nso small they can be better studied in watching them come out, than by\r\nattempting to dissect them, unless the scholars are sufficiently advanced\r\nto use the microscope easily. It is always bad for a pupil to attempt to\r\ndescribe what he sees but imperfectly. He will be sure to jump at any\r\nconclusions which he thinks ought to be correct.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-scars are semicircular, small and swollen.\r\n\r\nThe bud-rings are plain. The twigs make a very small growth in a season,\r\nso that the leaf-scars and rings make them exceedingly rough.\r\n\r\nThe flower-cluster scars are small circles, with a dot in the centre, in\r\nthe leaf-axils. The flowers come before the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-arrangement is alternate on the 2/5 plan. The pupils may compare\r\nthe branching with that of their other specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED MAPLE (_Acer rubrum_).\r\n\r\nThis is a good specimen for the study of accessory buds. There is usually\r\na bud in the axil of each lower scale of the axillary buds, making three\r\nside by side. We have already noticed this as occurring sometimes in\r\nLilac. It is habitually the case with the Red Maple. The middle bud, which\r\nis smaller and develops later, is a leaf-bud. The others are flower-buds.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-scars are small, with three dots on each scar. The rings are very\r\nplain. The flower-cluster leaves a round scar in the leaf-axil, as in\r\nCherry.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are opposite and the tree branches freely. The twigs seem to\r\nbe found just below the bud-rings, as the upper leaf-buds usually develop\r\nbest and the lower buds are single, containing flowers only.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWAY SPRUCE (_Picea excelsa_).\r\n\r\nThe buds are terminal, and axillary, from the axils of the leaves of the\r\npreceding year, usually from those at the ends of the branchlets. They are\r\ncovered with brown scales and contain many leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Branch of Cherry in winter state: _a_, leaf-scar;\r\n_b_, bud-scar; _c_, flower-scar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Branch of Red Maple in winter state (reduced). 2.\r\nFlower-buds]\r\n\r\nThe leaves are needle-shaped and short.[1] They are arranged densely on\r\nthe branches, alternately on the 8/21 plan (see section on phyllotaxy).\r\nWhen they drop off they leave a hard, blunt projection which makes the\r\nstem very rough. As the terminal bud always develops unless injured, the\r\ntree is excurrent, forming a straight trunk, throwing out branches on\r\nevery side. The axillary buds develop near the ends of the branchlets,\r\nforming apparent whorls of branches around the trunk. In the smaller\r\nbranches, as the tree grows older, the tendency is for only two buds to\r\ndevelop nearly opposite each other, forming a symmetrical branch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The pupils should observe how much more crowded the leaves\r\nare than in the other trees they have studied. The leaves being smaller,\r\nit is necessary to have more of them. Large-leaved trees have longer\r\ninternodes than those with small leaves.]\r\n\r\nThe bud-scales are persistent on the branches and the growth from year to\r\nyear can be traced a long way back.\r\n\r\nThe cones hang on the ends of the upper branches. They are much larger\r\nthan in our native species of Black and White Spruce.\r\n\r\nThe Evergreens are a very interesting study and an excellent exercise in\r\nmorphology for the older scholars.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Vernation_. This term signifies the disposition of leaves in the bud,\r\neither in respect to the way in which each leaf is folded, or to the\r\nmanner in which the leaves are arranged with reference to each other.\r\nThe pupils have described the folding of the leaves in some of their\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nIn the Beech, the leaf is _plicate_, or plaited on the veins. In the Elm,\r\nMagnolia, and Tulip-tree, it is _conduplicate_, that is, folded on\r\nthe midrib with the inner face within. In the Tulip-tree, it is also\r\n_inflexed_, the blade bent forwards on the petiole. In the Balm of Gilead,\r\nthe leaf is _involute_, rolled towards the midrib on the upper face.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of vernation are _revolute_, the opposite of involute, where\r\nthe leaf is rolled backwards towards the midrib; _circinate_, rolled from\r\nthe apex downwards, as we see in ferns; and _corrugate_, when the leaf is\r\ncrumpled in the bud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Branch of Norway Spruce.]\r\n\r\nIn all the trees we have studied, the leaves simply succeed each other,\r\neach leaf, or pair of leaves, overlapping the next in order. The names of\r\nthe overlapping of the leaves among themselves, _imbricated, convolute,\r\netc_., will not be treated here, as they are not needed. They will come\r\nunder _\xc3\xa6stivation_, the term used to describe the overlapping of the\r\nmodified leaves, which make up the flower.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. VIII. Young and Old Leaves.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Phyllotaxy_. The subject of leaf-arrangement is an extremely difficult\r\none, and it is best, even with the older pupils, to touch it lightly. The\r\npoint to be especially brought out is the disposition of the leaves so\r\nthat each can get the benefit of the light. This can be seen in any plant\r\nand there are many ways in which the desired result is brought about. The\r\nchief way is the distribution of the leaves about the stem, and this is\r\nwell studied from the leaf-scars.\r\n\r\nThe scholars should keep the branches they have studied. It is well to\r\nhave them marked with the respective names, that the teacher may examine\r\nand return them without fear of mistakes.\r\n\r\nIn the various branches that the pupils have studied, they have seen that\r\nthe arrangement of the leaves differs greatly. The arrangement of leaves\r\nis usually classed under three modes: the _alternate_, the _opposite_,\r\nand the _whorled_; but the opposite is the simplest form of the whorled\r\narrangement, the leaves being in circles of two. In this arrangement, the\r\nleaves of each whorl stand over the spaces of the whorl just below. The\r\npupils have observed and noted this in Horsechestnut and Lilac. In these\r\nthere are four vertical rows or ranks of leaves. In whorls of three leaves\r\nthere would be six ranks, in whorls of four, eight, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves are alternate, or single at each node of the stem, they\r\nare arranged in many different ways. Ask the pupils to look at all the\r\nbranches with alternate leaves that they have studied, and determine in\r\neach case what leaves stand directly over each other. That is, beginning\r\nwith any leaf, count the number of leaves passed on the stem, till one is\r\nreached that stands directly over the first.[1] In the Beech and the Elm\r\nthe leaves are on opposite sides of the stem, so that the third stands\r\ndirectly over the first. This makes two vertical ranks, or rows, of\r\nleaves, dividing the circle into halves. It is, therefore, called the\r\n1/2 arrangement. Another way of expressing it is to say that the angular\r\ndivergence between the leaves is 180\xc2\xb0, or one-half the circumference.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The pupils must be careful not to pass the bud-rings when\r\nthey are counting the leaves.]\r\n\r\nThe 1/3 arrangement, with the leaves in three vertical ranks, is not very\r\ncommon. It may be seen in Sedges, in the Orange-tree, and in Black Alder\r\n_(Ilex verticillata)_. In this arrangement, there are three ranks of\r\nleaves, and each leaf diverges from the next at an angle of 120\xc2\xb0, or\r\none-third of the circumference.\r\n\r\nBy far the commonest arrangement is with the leaves in five vertical\r\nranks. The Cherry, the Poplar, the Larch, the Oak, and many other trees\r\nexhibit this. In this arrangement there are five leaves necessary to\r\ncomplete the circle. We might expect, then, that each leaf would occupy\r\none-fifth of the circle. This would be the case were it not for the fact\r\nthat we have to pass twice around the stem in counting them, so that each\r\nleaf has twice as much room, or two-fifths of the circle, to itself. This\r\nis, therefore, the 2/5 arrangement. This can be shown by winding a thread\r\naround the stem, passing it over each leaf-scar. In the Beech we make one\r\nturn of the stem before reaching the third leaf which stands over the\r\nfirst. In the Apple the thread will wind twice about the stem, before\r\ncoming to the sixth leaf, which is over the first.\r\n\r\nAnother arrangement, not very common, is found in the Magnolia, the Holly,\r\nand the radical leaves of the common Plantain and Tobacco. The thread\r\nmakes three turns of the stem before reaching the eighth leaf which stands\r\nover the first. This is the 3/8 arrangement. It is well seen in the\r\nMarguerite, a greenhouse plant which is very easily grown in the house.\r\n\r\nLook now at these fractions, 1/2, 1/3, 2/5, and 3/8. The numerator of\r\nthe third is the sum of the numerators of the first and second, its\r\ndenominator, the sum of the two denominators. The same is true of the\r\nfourth fraction and the two immediately preceding it. Continuing the\r\nseries, we get the fractions 5/13, 8/21, 13/34. These arrangements can\r\nbe found in nature in cones, the scales of which are modified leaves and\r\nfollow the laws of leaf-arrangement.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See the uses and origin of the arrangement of leaves in\r\nplants. By Chauncey Wright. Memoirs Amer. Acad., IX, p. 389. This essay\r\nis an abstruse mathematical treatise on the theory of phyllotaxy. The\r\nfractions are treated as successive approximations to a theoretical angle,\r\nwhich represents the best possible exposure to air and light.\r\n\r\nModern authors, however, do not generally accept this mathematical view of\r\nleaf-arrangement.]\r\n\r\n[1]"It is to be noted that the distichous or 1/2 variety gives the maximum\r\ndivergence, namely 180\xc2\xb0, and that the tristichous, or 1/3, gives the\r\nleast, or 120\xc2\xb0; that the pentastichous, or 2/5, is nearly the mean between\r\nthe first two; that of the 3/8, nearly the mean between the two preceding,\r\netc. The disadvantage of the two-ranked arrangement is that the leaves are\r\nsoon superposed and so overshadow each other. This is commonly obviated by\r\nthe length of the internodes, which is apt to be much greater in this\r\nthan in the more complex arrangements, therefore placing them vertically\r\nfurther apart; or else, as in Elms, Beeches, and the like, the branchlets\r\ntake a horizontal position and the petioles a quarter twist, which gives\r\nfull exposure of the upper face of all the leaves to the light. The 1/3\r\nand 2/5, with diminished divergence, increase the number of ranks; the 3/8\r\nand all beyond, with mean divergence of successive leaves, effect a more\r\nthorough distribution, but with less and less angular distance between the\r\nvertical ranks."\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gray\'s Structural Botany, Chap, iv, p. 126.]\r\n\r\nFor directions for finding the arrangement of cones, see Gray\'s Structural\r\nBotany, Chap. IV, Sect. 1.\r\n\r\nThe subject appears easy when stated in a text-book, but, practically, it\r\nis often exceedingly difficult to determine the arrangement. Stems often\r\ntwist so as to alter entirely the apparent disposition of the leaves. The\r\ngeneral principle, however, that the leaves are disposed so as to get the\r\nbest exposure to air and light is clear. This cannot be shown by the study\r\nof the naked branches merely, because these do not show the beautiful\r\nresult of the distribution.[1] Many house plants can be found, which will\r\nafford excellent illustrations (Fig. 21). The Marguerite and Tobacco, both\r\neasily grown in the house, are on the 3/8 plan. The latter shows the eight\r\nranks most plainly in the rosette of its lower leaves. The distribution is\r\noften brought about by differences in the lengths of the petioles, as in\r\na Horsechestnut branch (Fig. 22) where the lower, larger leaves stand\r\nout further from the branch than the upper ones; or by a twist in the\r\npetioles, so that the upper faces of the leaves are turned up to the\r\nlight, as in Beech (Fig. 23). If it is springtime when the lessons are\r\ngiven, endless adaptations can be found.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. IX. Leaf-Arrangement.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.

I,\r\n51-62; I, 153.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nSTEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stem, as the scholars have already learned, is the axis of the plant.\r\nThe leaves are produced at certain definite points called nodes, and the\r\nportions of stem between these points are internodes. The internode,\r\nnode, and leaf make a single plant-part, and the plant is made up of a\r\nsuccession of such parts.\r\n\r\nThe stem, as well as the root and leaves, may bear plant-hairs. The\r\naccepted theory of plant structure assumes that these four parts, root,\r\nstem, leaves, and plant-hairs, are the only members of a flowering plant,\r\nand that all other forms, as flowers, tendrils, etc., are modified from\r\nthese. While this idea is at the foundation of all our teaching, causing\r\nus to lead the pupil to recognize as modified leaves the cotyledons of a\r\nseedling and the scales of a bud, it is difficult to state it directly\r\nso as to be understood, except by mature minds. I have been frequently\r\nsurprised at the failure of even bright and advanced pupils to grasp this\r\nidea, and believe it is better to let them first imbibe it unconsciously\r\nin their study. Whenever their minds are ready for it, it will be readily\r\nunderstood. The chief difficulty is that they imagine that there is a\r\ndirect metamorphosis of a leaf to a petal or a stamen.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the theory is this: the beginnings of leaf, petal, tendril, etc.,\r\nare the same. At an early stage of their growth it is impossible to tell\r\nwhat they are to become. They develop into the organ needed for the\r\nparticular work required of them to do. The organ, that under other\r\ncircumstances might develop into a leaf, is capable of developing into a\r\npetal, a stamen, or a pistil, according to the requirements of the plant,\r\nbut no actual metamorphosis takes place. Sometimes, instead of developing\r\ninto the form we should normally find, the organ develops into another\r\nform, as when a petal stands in the place of a stamen, or the pistil\r\nreverts to a leafy branch. This will be more fully treated under flowers.\r\nThe study of the different forms in which an organ may appear is the study\r\nof _morphology_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Forms of Stems_.--Stems may grow in many ways. Let the pupils compare\r\nthe habits of growth of the seedlings they have studied. The Sunflower and\r\nCorn are _erect_. This is the most usual habit, as with our common trees.\r\nThe Morning Glory is _twining_, the stem itself twists about a support.\r\nThe Bean, Pea and Nasturtium are _climbing_. The stems are weak, and\r\nare held up, in the first two by tendrils, in the last by the twining\r\nleaf-stalks. The English Ivy, as we have seen, is also climbing, by means\r\nof its a\xc3\xabrial roots. The Red Clover is _ascending_, the branches rising\r\nobliquely from the base. Some kinds of Clover, as the White Clover, are\r\n_creeping_, that is, with prostrate branches rooting at the nodes and\r\nforming new plants. Such rooting branches are called _stolons_, or when\r\nthe stem runs underground, _suckers_. The gardener imitates them in\r\nthe process called layering, that is, bending down an erect branch and\r\ncovering it with soil, causing it to strike root. When the connecting stem\r\nis cut, a new plant is formed. Long and leafless stolons, like those of\r\nthe Strawberry are called _runners_. Stems creep below the ground as well\r\nas above. Probably the pupil will think of some examples. The pretty\r\nlittle Gold Thread is so named from the yellow running stems, which grow\r\nbeneath the ground and send up shoots, or suckers, which make new plants.\r\nMany grasses propagate themselves in this way. Such stems are called\r\n_rootstocks_. "That these are really stems, and not roots, is evident\r\nfrom the way in which they grow; from their consisting of a succession of\r\njoints; and from the leaves which they bear on each node, in the form\r\nof small scales, just like the lowest ones on the upright stem next the\r\nground. They also produce buds in the axils of these scales, showing the\r\nscales to be leaves; whereas real roots bear neither leaves nor axillary\r\nbuds."[1] Rootstocks are often stored with nourishment. We have already\r\ntaken up this subject in the potato, but it is well to repeat the\r\ndistinction between stems and roots. A thick, short rootstock provided\r\nwith buds, like the potato, is called a _tuber_. Compare again the corm of\r\nCrocus and the bulb of Onion to find the stem in each. In the former, it\r\nmakes the bulk of the whole; in the latter, it is a mere plate holding the\r\nfleshy bases of the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gray\'s First Lessons, revised edition, 1887, page 42.]\r\n\r\n2. _Movements of Stems.--_Let a glass thread, no larger than a coarse\r\nhair, be affixed by means of some quickly drying varnish to the tip of the\r\nlaterally inclined stem of one of the young Morning-Glory plants in the\r\nschoolroom. Stand a piece of cardboard beside the pot, at right angles to\r\nthe stem, so that the end of the glass will be near the surface of the\r\ncard. Make a dot upon the card opposite the tip of the filament, taking\r\ncare not to disturb the position of either. In a few minutes observe that\r\nthe filament is no longer opposite the dot. Mark its position anew, and\r\ncontinue thus until a circle is completed on the cardboard. This is a\r\nrough way of conducting the experiment. Darwin\'s method will be found in\r\nthe footnote.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: "Plants growing in pots were protected wholly from the light,\r\nor had light admitted from above or on one side as the case might require,\r\nand were covered above by a large horizontal sheet of glass, and with\r\nanother vertical sheet on one side. A glass filament, not thicker than a\r\nhorsehair, and from a quarter to three-quarters of an inch in length,\r\nwas affixed to the part to be observed by means of shellac dissolved in\r\nalcohol. The solution was allowed to evaporate until it became so thick\r\nthat it set hard in two or three seconds, and it never injured the\r\ntissues, even the tips of tender radicles, to which it was applied. To the\r\nend of the glass filament an excessively minute bead of black sealing-wax\r\nwas cemented, below or behind which a bit of card with a black dot was\r\nfixed to a stick driven into the ground.... The bead and the dot on the\r\ncard were viewed through the horizontal or vertical glass-plate (according\r\nto the position of the object) and when one exactly covered the other, a\r\ndot was made on the glass plate with a sharply pointed stick dipped in\r\nthick India ink. Other dots were made at short intervals of time and these\r\nwere afterwards joined by straight lines. The figures thus traced were\r\ntherefore angular, but if dots had been made every one or two minutes, the\r\nlines would have been more curvilinear."--The Power of Movement in Plants,\r\np. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe use of the glass filament is simply to increase the size of the circle\r\ndescribed, and thus make visible the movements of the stem. All young\r\nparts of stems are continually moving in circles or ellipses. "To learn\r\nhow the sweeps are made, one has only to mark a line of dots along the\r\nupper side of the outstretched revolving end of such a stem, and to note\r\nthat when it has moved round a quarter of a circle, these dots will be on\r\none side; when half round, the dots occupy the lower side; and when the\r\nrevolution is completed, they are again on the upper side. That is, the\r\nstem revolves by bowing itself over to one side,--is either pulled over or\r\npushed over, or both, by some internal force, which acts in turn all round\r\nthe stem in the direction in which it sweeps; and so the stem makes its\r\ncircuits without twisting."[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: How Plants Behave. By Asa Gray. Ivison, Blakeman, Taylor &\r\nCo., New York, 1872. Page 13.]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the movement is thus a successive nodding to all the points\r\nof the compass, whence it is called by Darwin _circumnutation_. The\r\nmovement belongs to all young growing parts of plants. The great sweeps of\r\na twining stem, like that of the Morning-Glory, are only an increase in\r\nthe size of the circle or ellipse described.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: "In the course of the present volume it will be shown\r\nthat apparently every growing part of every plant is continually\r\ncircumnutating, though often on a small scale. Even the stems of seedlings\r\nbefore they have broken through the ground, as well as their buried\r\nradicles, circumnutate, as far as the pressure of the surrounding earth\r\npermits. In this universally present movement we have the basis or\r\ngroundwork for the acquirement, according to the requirements of the\r\nplant, of the most diversified movements. Thus the great sweeps made by\r\nthe stems of the twining plants, and by the tendrils of other climbers,\r\nresult from a mere increase in the amplitude of the ordinary movement of\r\ncircumnutation."--The Power of Movement in Plants, p. 3.]\r\n\r\nWhen a young stem of a Morning-Glory, thus revolving, comes in contact\r\nwith a support, it will twist around it, unless the surface is too smooth\r\nto present any resistance to the movement of the plant. Try to make\r\nit twine up a glass rod. It will slip up the rod and fall off. The\r\nMorning-Glory and most twiners move around from left to right like the\r\nhands of a clock, but a few turn from right to left.\r\n\r\nWhile this subject is under consideration, the tendrils of the Pea and\r\nBean and the twining petioles of the Nasturtium will be interesting for\r\ncomparison. The movements can be made visible by the same method as was\r\nused for the stem of the Morning-Glory. Tendrils and leaf petioles are\r\noften sensitive to the touch. If a young leaf stalk of Clematis be rubbed\r\nfor a few moments, especially on the under side, it will be found in a day\r\nor two to be turned inward, and the tendrils of the Cucumber vine will\r\ncoil in a few minutes after being thus irritated.[1] The movements of\r\ntendrils are charmingly described in the chapter entitled "How Plants\r\nClimb," in the little treatise by Dr. Gray, already mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. X. Climbing Plants.]\r\n\r\nThe so-called "sleep of plants" is another similar movement. The Oxalis is\r\na good example. The leaves droop and close together at night, protecting\r\nthem from being chilled by too great radiation.\r\n\r\nThe cause of these movements is believed to lie in changes of tension\r\npreceding growth in the tissues of the stem.[1] Every stem is in a state\r\nof constant tension. Naudin has thus expressed it, "the interior of every\r\nstem is too large for its Jacket."[2] If a leaf-stalk of Nasturtium be\r\nslit vertically for an inch or two, the two halves will spring back\r\nabruptly. This is because the outer tissues of the stem are stretched,\r\nand spring back like india-rubber when released. If two stalks twining\r\nin opposite directions be slit as above described, the side of the stem\r\ntowards which each stalk is bent will spring back more than the other,\r\nshowing the tension to be greater on that side. A familiar illustration of\r\nthis tension will be found in the Dandelion curls of our childhood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Physiological Botany. By Geo. L. Goodale. Ivison & Co.,\r\nNew York, 1885. Page 406.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The following experiment exhibits the phenomenon of tension\r\nvery strikingly. "From a long and thrifty young internode of grapevine\r\ncut a piece that shall measure exactly one hundred units, for instance,\r\nmillimeters. From this section, which measures exactly one hundred\r\nmillimeters, carefully separate the epidermal structures in strips, and\r\nplace the strips at once under an inverted glass to prevent drying;\r\nnext, separate the pith in a single unbroken piece wholly freed from the\r\nligneous tissue. Finally, remeasure the isolated portions, and compare\r\nwith the original measure of the internode. There will be found an\r\nappreciable shortening of the epidermal tissues and a marked increase in\r\nlength of the pith."--Physiological Botany, p. 391.]\r\n\r\nThe movements of the Sensitive Plant are always very interesting to\r\npupils, and it is said not to be difficult to raise the plants in the\r\nschoolroom. The whole subject, indeed, is one of the most fascinating\r\nthat can be found, and its literature is available, both for students and\r\nteachers. Darwin\'s essay on "Climbing Plants," and his later work on the\r\n"Power of Movement in Plants," Dr. Gray\'s "How Plants Behave," and the\r\nchapter on "Movements" in the "Physiological Botany," will offer a wide\r\nfield for study and experiment.\r\n\r\n3. _Structure of Stems_.--Let the pupils collect a series of branches of\r\nsome common tree or shrub, from the youngest twig up to as large a branch\r\nas they can cut, and describe them. Poplar, Elm, Oak, Lilac, etc., will be\r\nfound excellent for the purpose.\r\n\r\nWhile discussing these descriptions, a brief explanation of\r\nplant-structure may be given. In treating this subject, the teacher must\r\ngovern himself by the needs of his class, and the means at his command.\r\nExplanations requiring the use of a compound microscope do not enter\r\nnecessarily into these lessons. The object aimed at is to teach the pupils\r\nabout the things which they can see and handle for themselves. Looking at\r\nsections that others have prepared is like looking at pictures; and, while\r\nuseful in opening their eyes and minds to the wonders hidden from our\r\nunassisted sight, fails to give the real benefit of scientific training.\r\nPlants are built up of cells. The delicate-walled spherical, or polygonal,\r\ncells which make up the bulk of an herbaceous stem, constitute cellular\r\ntissue (_parenchyma_). This was well seen in the stem of the cutting of\r\nBean in which the roots had begun to form.[1] The strengthening fabric\r\nin almost all flowering plants is made up of woody bundles, or woody\r\ntissue.[2] The wood-cells are cells which are elongated and with thickened\r\nwalls. There are many kinds of them. Those where the walls are very thick\r\nand the cavity within extremely small are _fibres_. A kind of cell, not\r\nstrictly woody, is where many cells form long vessels by the breaking away\r\nof the connecting walls. These are _ducts_. These two kinds of cells\r\nare generally associated together in woody bundles, called therefore\r\nfibro-vascular bundles. We have already spoken of them as making the dots\r\non the leaf-scars, and forming the strengthening fabric of the leaves.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See page 46.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: If elements of the same kind are untied, they constitute a\r\ntissue to which is given the name of those elements; thus parenchyma cells\r\nform parenchyma tissue or simply parenchyma; cork-cells form cork, etc. A\r\ntissue can therefore be defined as a fabric of united cells which have had\r\na common origin and obeyed a common law of growth.--Physiological Botany.\r\np. 102.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See page 58.]\r\n\r\nWe will now examine our series of branches. The youngest twigs, in spring\r\nor early summer, are covered with a delicate, nearly colorless skin.\r\nBeneath this is a layer of bark, usually green, which gives the color to\r\nthe stem, an inner layer of bark, the wood and the pith. The pith is soft,\r\nspongy and somewhat sappy. There is also sap between the bark and the\r\nwood. An older twig has changed its color. There is a layer of brown bark,\r\nwhich has replaced the colorless skin. In a twig a year old the wood is\r\nthicker and the pith is dryer. Comparing sections of older branches with\r\nthese twigs, we find that the pith has shrunk and become quite dry, and\r\nthat the wood is in rings. It is not practicable for the pupils to\r\ncompare the number of these rings with the bud-rings, and so find out for\r\nthemselves that the age of the branch can be determined from the wood, for\r\nin young stems the successive layers are not generally distinct. But, in\r\nall the specimens, the sap is found just between the wood and the bark,\r\nand here, where the supply of food is, is where the growth is taking\r\nplace. Each year new wood and new bark are formed in this _cambium-layer_,\r\nas it is called, new wood on its inner, new bark on its outer face. Trees\r\nwhich thus form a new ring of wood every year are called _exogenous_, or\r\noutside-growing.\r\n\r\nAsk the pupils to separate the bark into its three layers and to try\r\nthe strength of each. The two outer will easily break, but the inner is\r\ngenerally tough and flexible. It is this inner bark, which makes the\r\nPoplar and Willow branches so hard to break. These strong, woody fibres\r\nof the inner bark give us many of our textile fabrics. Flax and Hemp come\r\nfrom the inner bark of their respective plants (_Linum usitatissimum_ and\r\n_Cannabis sativa_), and Russia matting is made from the bark of the Linden\r\n(_Tilia Americana_).\r\n\r\nWe have found, in comparing the bark of specimens of branches of various\r\nages, that, in the youngest stems, the whole is covered with a skin, or\r\n_epidermis_, which is soon replaced by a brown outer layer of bark, called\r\nthe _corky layer_; the latter gives the distinctive color to the tree.\r\nWhile this grows, it increases by a living layer of cork-cambium on its\r\ninner face, but it usually dies after a few years. In some trees it goes\r\non growing for many years. It forms the layers of bark in the Paper Birch\r\nand the cork of commerce is taken from the Cork Oak of Spain. The green\r\nbark is of cellular tissue, with some green coloring matter like that of\r\nthe leaves; it is at first the outer layer, but soon becomes covered with\r\ncork. It does not usually grow after the first year. Scraping the bark of\r\nan old tree, we find the bark homogeneous. The outer layers have perished\r\nand been cast off. As the tree grows from within, the bark is stretched\r\nand, if not replaced, cracks and falls away piecemeal. So, in most old\r\ntrees, the bark consists of successive layers of the inner woody bark.\r\n\r\nStems can be well studied from pieces of wood from the woodpile. The ends\r\nof the log will show the concentric rings. These can be traced as long,\r\nwavy lines in vertical sections of the log, especially if the surface is\r\nsmooth. If the pupils can whittle off different planes for themselves,\r\nthey will form a good idea of the formation of the wood. In many of\r\nthe specimens there will be knots, and the nature of these will be an\r\ninteresting subject for questions. If the knot is near the centre of the\r\nlog, lead back their thoughts to the time when the tree was as small as\r\nthe annular ring on which the centre of the knot lies. Draw a line on this\r\nring to represent the tree at this period of its growth. What could the\r\nknot have been? It has concentric circles like the tree itself. It was a\r\nbranch which decayed, or was cut off. Year after year, new rings of wood\r\nformed themselves round this broken branch, till it was covered from\r\nsight, and every year left it more deeply buried in the trunk.\r\n\r\nExtremely interesting material for the study of wood will be found in thin\r\nsections prepared for veneers. Packages of such sections will be of great\r\nuse to the teacher.[1] They show well the reason of the formation of a\r\ndividing line between the wood of successive seasons. In a cross section\r\nof Oak or Chestnut the wood is first very open and porous and then close.\r\nThis is owing to the presence of ducts in the wood formed in the spring.\r\nIn other woods there are no ducts, or they are evenly distributed, but\r\nthe transition from the close autumn wood, consisting of smaller and\r\nmore closely packed cells, to the wood of looser texture, formed in the\r\nfollowing spring, makes a line that marks the season\'s growth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Romeyn B. Hough, of Lowville, N.Y., will supply a package\r\nof such sections for one dollar. The package will consist of several\r\ndifferent woods, in both cross and vertical section and will contain\r\nenough duplicates for an ordinary class.\r\n\r\nHe also issues a series of books on woods illustrated by actual and neatly\r\nmounted specimens, showing in each case three distinct views of the grain.\r\nThe work is issued in parts, each representing twenty-five species, and\r\nselling with text at $5, expressage prepaid; the mounted specimens alone\r\nat 25 cts. per species or twenty-five in neat box for $4. He has also\r\na line of specimens prepared for the stereopticon and another for the\r\nmicroscope. They are very useful and sell at 50 cts. per species or\r\ntwenty-five for $10.]\r\n\r\nLet each of the scholars take one of the sections of Oak and write a\r\ndescription of its markings. The age is easily determined; the pith rays,\r\nor _medullary rays_, are also plain. These form what is called the silver\r\ngrain of the wood. The ducts, also, are clear in the Oak and Chestnut.\r\nThere is a difference in color between the outer and inner wood, the older\r\nwood becomes darker and is called the _heart-wood_, the outer is the\r\n_sap-wood_. In Birds-eye Maple, and some other woods, the abortive buds\r\nare seen. They are buried in the wood, and make the disturbance which\r\nproduces the ornamental grain. In sections of Pine or Spruce, no ducts\r\ncan be found. The wood consists entirely of elongated, thickened cells or\r\nfibres. In some of the trees the pith rays cannot be seen with the naked\r\neye.\r\n\r\nLet the pupils compare the branches which they have described, with a\r\nstalk of Asparagus, Rattan, or Lily. A cross section of one of these shows\r\ndots among the soft tissue. These are ends of the fibro-vascular bundles,\r\nwhich in these plants are scattered through the cellular tissue instead of\r\nbeing brought together in a cylinder outside of the pith. In a vertical\r\nsection they appear as lines. There are no annular rings.\r\n\r\nIf possible, let the pupils compare the leaves belonging to these\r\ndifferent types of stems. The parallel-veined leaves of monocotyledons\r\nhave stems without distinction of wood, bark and pith; the netted-veined\r\nleaves of dicotyledons have exogenous stems.\r\n\r\nDicotyledons have bark, wood, and pith, and grow by producing a new ring\r\nof wood outside the old. They also increase by the growth of the woody\r\nbundles of the leaves, which mingle with those of the stem.[1] Twist off\r\nthe leaf-stalk of any leaf, and trace the bundles into the stem.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See note, p. 127, Physiological Botany.]\r\n\r\nMonocotyledons have no layer which has the power of producing new wood,\r\nand their growth takes place entirely from the intercalation of new\r\nbundles, which originate at the bases of the leaves. The lower part of a\r\nstem of a Palm, for instance, does not increase in size after it has lost\r\nits crown of leaves. This is carried up gradually. The upper part of the\r\nstem is a cone, having fronds, and below this cone the stem does not\r\nincrease in diameter. The word _endogenous_, inside-growing, is not,\r\ntherefore, a correct one to describe the growth of most monocotyledons,\r\nfor the growth takes place where the leaves originate, near the exterior\r\nof the stem.\r\n\r\n_Gray\'s First Lessons_.

Chap. 1, 82, 90-118.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nLEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have studied leaves as cotyledons, bud-scales, etc., but when we speak\r\nof _leaves_, we do not think of these adapted forms, but of the green\r\nfoliage of the plant.\r\n\r\n1. _Forms and Structure_.--Provide the pupils with a number of green\r\nleaves, illustrating simple and compound, pinnate and palmate, sessile and\r\npetioled leaves. They must first decide the question, _What are the parts\r\nof a leaf_? All the specimens have a green _blade_ which, in ordinary\r\nspeech, we call the leaf. Some have a stalk, or _petiole_, others are\r\njoined directly to the stem. In some of them, as a rose-leaf, for\r\ninstance, there are two appendages at the base of the petiole, called\r\n_stipules_. These three parts are all that any leaf has, and a leaf that\r\nhas them all is complete.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the blade. Those leaves which have the blade in one\r\npiece are called _simple_; those with the blade in separate pieces are\r\n_compound_. We have already answered the question, _What constitutes a\r\nsingle leaf_?[1] Let the pupils repeat the experiment of cutting off the\r\ntop of a seedling Pea, if it is not already clear in their minds, and find\r\nbuds in the leaf-axils of other plants.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See page 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: With one class of children, I had much difficulty in making\r\nthem understand the difference between simple and compound leaves. I did\r\nnot tell them that the way to tell a single leaf was to look for buds in\r\nthe axils, but incautiously drew their attention to the stipules at the\r\nbase of a rose leaf as a means of knowing that the whole was one. Soon\r\nafter, they had a locust leaf to describe; and, immediately, with the\r\nacuteness that children are apt to develop so inconveniently to their\r\nteacher, they triumphantly refuted my statement that it was one leaf, by\r\npointing to the stiples. There was no getting over the difficulty; and\r\nalthough I afterwards explained to them about the position of the buds,\r\nand showed them examples, they clung with true childlike tenacity to their\r\nfirst impression and always insisted that they could not see why each\r\nleaflet was not a separate leaf.]\r\n\r\nAn excellent way to show the nature of compound leaves is to mount a\r\nseries showing every gradation of cutting, from a simple, serrate leaf to\r\na compound one (Figs. 24 and 25). A teacher, who would prepare in summer\r\nsuch illustrations as these, would find them of great use in his winter\r\nlessons. The actual objects make an impression that the cuts in the book\r\ncannot give.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Series of palmately-veined leaves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Series of pinnately-veined leaves.]\r\n\r\nLet the pupils compare the distribution of the veins in their specimens.\r\nThey have already distinguished parallel-veined from netted-veined leaves,\r\nand learned that this difference is a secondary distinction between\r\nmonocotyledons and dicotyledons.[1] The veins in netted-veined leaves are\r\narranged in two ways. The veins start from either side of a single midrib\r\n(_feather-veined_ or _pinnately-veined_), or they branch from a number of\r\nribs which all start from the top of the petiole, like the fingers from\r\nthe palm of the hand (_palmately-veined_). The compound leaves correspond\r\nto these modes of venation; they are either pinnately or palmately\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See page 34.]\r\n\r\nThese ribs and veins are the woody framework of the leaf, supporting the\r\nsoft green pulp. The woody bundles are continuous with those of the stem,\r\nand carry the crude sap, brought from the roots, into the cells of every\r\npart of the leaf, where it is brought into contact with the external\r\nair, and the process of making food (_Assimilation_ 4) is carried on.\r\n"Physiologically, leaves are green expansions borne by the stern,\r\noutspread in the air and light, in which assimilation and the processes\r\nconnected with it are carried on."[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gray\'s Structural Botany, p. 85.]\r\n\r\nThe whole leaf is covered with a delicate skin, or epidermis, continuous\r\nwith that of the stem.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. XI. Protection of Leaves from the Attacks\r\nof Animals.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Descriptions_.--As yet the pupils have had no practice in writing\r\ntechnical descriptions. This sort of work may be begun when they come to\r\nthe study of leaves. In winter a collection of pressed specimens will be\r\nuseful. Do not attach importance to the memorizing of terms. Let them be\r\nlooked up as they are needed, and they will become fixed by practice. The\r\npupils may fill out such schedules as the following with any leaves that\r\nare at hand.\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE FOR LEAVES.\r\n\r\n             Arrangement                   _Alternate_[1]\r\n\r\n            |Simple or compound.           _Simple_\r\n            |(arr. and no. of leaflets)\r\n            |\r\n            |Venation                      _Netted and\r\n            |                              feather-veined_\r\n            |Shape                         _Oval_\r\n1.

Veins prominent and very straight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The specimen described is a leaf of Copper Beech.]\r\n\r\nIn describing shapes, etc., the pupils can find the terms in the book as\r\nthey need them. It is desirable at first to give leaves that are easily\r\nmatched with the terms, keeping those which need compound words, such as\r\nlance-ovate, etc., to come later. The pupils are more interested if they\r\nare allowed to press and keep the specimens they have described. It is not\r\nwell to put the pressed leaves in their note books, as it is difficult to\r\nwrite in the books without spoiling the specimens. It is better to mount\r\nthe specimens on white paper, keeping these sheets in brown paper covers.\r\nThe pupils can make illustrations for themselves by sorting leaves\r\naccording to the shapes, outlines, etc., and mounting them.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Transpiration_.--This term is used to denote the evaporation of water\r\nfrom a plant. The evaporation takes place principally through breathing\r\npores, which are scattered all over the surface of leaves and young stems.\r\nThe _breathing pores_, or _stomata_, of the leaves, are small openings\r\nin the epidermis through which the air can pass into the interior of the\r\nplant. Each of these openings is called a _stoma_. "They are formed by a\r\ntransformation of some of the cells of the epidermis; and consist usually\r\nof a pair of cells (called guardian cells), with an opening between\r\nthem, which communicates with an air-chamber within, and thence with the\r\nirregular intercellular spaces which permeate the interior of the leaf.\r\nThrough the stomata, when open, free interchange may take place between\r\nthe external air and that within the leaf, and thus transpiration be\r\nmuch facilitated. When closed, this interchange will be interrupted or\r\nimpeded."[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gray\'s Structural Botany, page 89. For a description of the\r\nmechanism of the stomata, see Physiological Botany, p. 269.]\r\n\r\nIn these lessons, however, it is not desirable to enter upon subjects\r\ninvolving the use of the compound microscope. Dr. Goodale says: "Whether\r\nit is best to try to explain to the pupils the structure of these valves,\r\nor stomata, must be left to each teacher. It would seem advisable to\r\npass by the subject untouched, unless the teacher has become reasonably\r\nfamiliar with it by practical microscopical study of leaves. For a teacher\r\nto endeavor to explain the complex structure of the leaf, without having\r\nseen it for himself, is open to the same objection which could be urged\r\nagainst the attempted explanation of complicated machinery by one who has\r\nnever seen it, but has heard about it. What is here said with regard to\r\nstomata applies to all the more recondite matters connected with plant\r\nstructure."[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Concerning a few Common Plants, p. 29.]\r\n\r\nThere are many simple experiments which can be used to illustrate the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n(1) Pass the stem of a cutting through a cork, fitting tightly into the\r\nneck of a bottle of water. Make the cork perfectly air-tight by coating it\r\nwith beeswax or paraffine. The level of the liquid in the bottle will be\r\nlowered by the escape of water through the stem and leaves of the cutting\r\ninto the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n(2) Cut two shoots of any plant, leave one on the table and place the\r\nother in a glass of water.[1] The first will soon wilt, while the other\r\nwill remain fresh. If the latter shoot be a cutting from some plant that\r\nwill root in water, such as Ivy, it will not fade at all. Also, leave one\r\nof the plants in the schoolroom unwatered for a day or two, till it begins\r\nto wilt. If the plant be now thoroughly watered, it will recover and the\r\nleaves will resume their normal appearance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Lessons in Elementary Botany, by Daniel Oliver, London.\r\nMacmillan & Co., 1864, pp. 14-15.]\r\n\r\nEvaporation is thus constantly taking place from the leaves, and if there\r\nis no moisture to supply the place of what is lost, the cells collapse and\r\nthe leaf, as we say, wilts. When water is again supplied the cells swell\r\nand the leaf becomes fresh.\r\n\r\n(3) Place two seedlings in water, one with its top, the other with its\r\nroots in the jar. The latter will remain fresh while the first wilts and\r\ndies.\r\n\r\nAbsorption takes place through the roots. The water absorbed is drawn up\r\nthrough the woody tissues of the stem (4), and the veins of the leaves\r\n(5), whence it escapes into the air (6).\r\n\r\n(4) Plunge a cut branch immediately into a colored solution, such as\r\naniline red, and after a time make sections in the stem above the liquid\r\nto see what tissues have been stained.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Essentials of Botany, by Charles E. Bessey. New York,\r\nHenry Holt & Co., 1884. Page 74. See also Physiological Botany, pp.\r\n259-260.]\r\n\r\n(5) "That water finds its way by preference through the fibro-vascular\r\nbundles even in the more delicate parts, is shown by placing the cut\r\npeduncle of a white tulip, or other large white flower, in a harmless dye,\r\nand then again cutting off its end in order to bring a fresh surface in\r\ncontact with the solution,[1] when after a short time the dye will mount\r\nthrough the flower-stalk and tinge the parts of the perianth according to\r\nthe course of the bundles."[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: If the stems of flowers are cut under water they will last a\r\nwonderfully long time. "One of the most interesting characteristics of the\r\nwoody tissues in relation to the transfer of water is the immediate change\r\nwhich the cut surface of a stem undergoes upon exposure to the air,\r\nunfitting it for its full conductive work. De Vries has shown that when a\r\nshoot of a vigorous plant, for instance a Helianthus, is bent down under\r\nwater, care being taken not to break it even in the slightest degree,\r\na clean, sharp cut will give a surface which will retain the power of\r\nabsorbing water for a long time; while a similar shoot cut in the open\r\nair, even if the end is instantly plunged under water, will wither much\r\nsooner than the first."--Physiological Botany, p. 263.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Physiological Botany, p. 260.]\r\n\r\n(6) Let the leaves of a growing plant rest against the window-pane.\r\nMoisture will be condensed on the cold surface of the glass, wherever the\r\nleaf is in contact with it. This is especially well seen in Nasturtium\r\n(Trop\xc3\xa6olum) leaves, which grow directly against a window, and leave the\r\nmarks even of their veining on the glass, because the moisture is only\r\ngiven out from the green tissue, and where the ribs are pressed against\r\nthe glass it is left dry.\r\n\r\nSometimes the water is drawn up into the cells of the leaves faster than\r\nit can escape into the atmosphere.[1] This is prettily shown if we place\r\nsome of our Nasturtium seedlings under a ward-case. The air in the case is\r\nsaturated with moisture, so that evaporation cannot take place, but the\r\nwater is, nevertheless, drawn up from the roots and through the branches,\r\nand appears as little drops on the margins of the leaves. That this is\r\nowing to the absorbing power of the roots, may be shown by breaking off\r\nthe seedling, and putting the slip in water. No drops now appear on the\r\nleaves, but as soon as the cutting has formed new roots, the drops again\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Lectures on the Physiology of Plants. By Sidney Howard\r\nVines, Cambridge, England. University Press, 1886. Page 92.]\r\n\r\nThis constant escape of water from the leaves causes a current to flow\r\nfrom the roots through the stem into the cells of the leaves. The dilute\r\nmineral solutions absorbed by the roots[1] are thus brought where they\r\nare in contact with the external air, concentrated by the evaporation of\r\nwater, and converted in these cells into food materials, such as starch.\r\nThe presence of certain mineral matters, as potassium, iron, etc., are\r\nnecessary to this assimilating process, but the reason of their necessity\r\nis imperfectly understood, as they do not enter in the products formed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See page 48.]\r\n\r\nThe amount of water exhaled is often very great. Certain plants are used\r\nfor this reason for the drainage of wet and marshy places. The most\r\nimportant of these is the Eucalyptus tree.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. XII. Transpiration.]\r\n\r\n"The amount of water taken from the soil by the trees of a forest and\r\npassed into the air by transpiration is not so large as that accumulated\r\nin the soil by the diminished evaporation under the branches. Hence, there\r\nis an accumulation of water in the shade of forests which is released\r\nslowly by drainage.[1] But if the trees are so scattered as not materially\r\nto reduce evaporation from the ground, the effect of transpiration in\r\ndiminishing the moisture of the soil is readily shown. It is noted,\r\nespecially in case of large plants having a great extent of exhaling\r\nsurface, such, for instance, as the common sunflower. Among the plants\r\nwhich have been successfully employed in the drainage of marshy soil by\r\ntranspiration probably the species of Eucalyptus (notably _E_. _globulus_)\r\nare most efficient."[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. XIII. Uses of the Forests.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Physiological Botany, page 283.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Assimilation_.--It is not easy to find practical experiments on\r\nassimilation. Those which follow are taken from "Physiological Botany" (p.\r\n305).\r\n\r\n   Fill a five-inch test tube, provided with a foot, with fresh drinking\r\n   water. In this place a sprig of one of the following water\r\n   plants,--_Elodea Canadensis, Myriophyllum spicatum, M.\r\n   verticillatum_, or any leafy _Myriophyllum_ (in fact, any small-\r\n   leaved water plant with rather crowded foliage). This sprig should be\r\n   prepared as follows: Cut the stem squarely off, four inches or so\r\n   from the tip, dry the cut surface quickly with blotting paper, then\r\n   cover the end of the stein with a quickly drying varnish, for\r\n   instance, asphalt-varnish, and let it dry perfectly, keeping the rest\r\n   of the stem, if possible, moist by means of a wet cloth. When the\r\n   varnish is dry, puncture it with a needle, and immerse the stem in\r\n   the water in the test tube, keeping the varnished larger end\r\n   uppermost. If the submerged plant be now exposed to the strong rays\r\n   of the sun, bubbles of oxygen gas will begin to pass off at a rapid\r\n   and even rate, but not too fast to be easily counted. If the simple\r\n   apparatus has begun to give off a regular succession of small\r\n   bubbles, the following experiments can be at once conducted:\r\n\r\n   (1) Substitute for the fresh water some which has been boiled a few\r\n   minutes before, and then allowed to completely cool: by the boiling,\r\n   all the carbonic acid has been expelled. If the plant is immersed in\r\n   this water and exposed to the sun\'s rays, no bubbles will be evolved;\r\n   there is no carbonic acid within reach of the plant for the\r\n   assimilative process. But,\r\n\r\n   (2) If breath from the lungs be passed by means of a slender glass\r\n   tube through the water, a part of the carbonic acid exhaled from the\r\n   lungs will be dissolved in it, and with this supply of the gas the\r\n   plant begins the work of assimilation immediately.\r\n\r\n   (3) If the light be shut off, the evolution of bubbles will presently\r\n   cease, being resumed soon after light again has access to the plant.\r\n\r\n   (5) Place round the base of the test tube a few fragments of ice, in\r\n   order to appreciably lower the temperature of the water. At a certain\r\n   point it will be observed that no bubbles are given off, and their\r\n   evolution does not begin again until the water becomes warm.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of bubbles shows that the process of making food is going\r\non. The materials for this process are carbonic acid gas and water. The\r\ncarbonic acid dissolved in the surrounding water is absorbed, the carbon\r\nunites with the elements of water in the cells of the leaves, forming\r\nstarch, etc., and most of the oxygen is set free, making the stream of\r\nbubbles. When the water is boiled, the dissolved gas is driven off and\r\nassimilation cannot go on; but as soon as more carbonic acid gas is\r\nsupplied, the process again begins. We have seen by these experiments\r\nthat sunlight and sufficient heat are necessary to assimilation, and that\r\ncarbonic acid gas and water must be present. The presence of the green\r\ncoloring matter of the leaves (chlorophyll) is also essential, and some\r\nsalts, such as potassium, iron, etc., are needful, though they may not\r\nenter into the compounds formed.\r\n\r\nThe food products are stored in various parts of the plant for future use,\r\nor are expended immediately in the growth and movements of the plant. In\r\norder that they shall be used for growth, free oxygen is required, and\r\nthis is supplied by the respiration of the plant.\r\n\r\nSome plants steal their food ready-made. Such a one is the Dodder, which\r\nsends its roots directly into the plant on which it feeds. This is a\r\n_parasite_.[1] It has no need of leaves to carry on the process of making\r\nfood. Some parasites with green leaves, like the mistletoe, take the crude\r\nsap from the host-plant and assimilate it in their own green leaves.\r\nPlants that are nourished by decaying matter in the soil are called\r\n_saprophytes_. Indian Pipe and Beech-Drops are examples of this. They need\r\nno green leaves as do plants that are obliged to support themselves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. XIV. Parasitic Plants.]\r\n\r\nSome plants are so made that they can use animal matter for food. This\r\nsubject of insectivorous plants is always of great interest to pupils. If\r\nsome Sundew (_Drosera_) can be obtained and kept in the schoolroom, it\r\nwill supply material for many interesting experiments.[1] That plants\r\nshould possess the power of catching insects by specialized movements and\r\nafterwards should digest them by means of a gastric juice like that of\r\nanimals, is one of the most interesting of the discoveries that have been\r\nworked out during the last thirty years.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Insectivorous Plants, by Charles Darwin. New York: D.\r\nAppleton and Co., 1875.\r\n\r\nHow Plants Behave, Chap. III.\r\n\r\nA bibliography of the most important works on the subject will be found in\r\nPhysiological Botany, page 351, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Reader in Botany. XV. Insectivorous Plants.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Respiration_.--Try the following experiment in germination.\r\n\r\nPlace some seeds on a sponge under an air-tight glass. Will they grow?\r\nWhat causes them to mould?\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeds will not germinate without free access of air. They must have free\r\noxygen to breathe, as must every living thing. We know that an animal\r\nbreathes in oxygen, that the oxygen unites with particles of carbon within\r\nthe body and that the resulting carbonic acid gas is exhaled.[1] The same\r\nprocess goes on in plants, but it was until recently entirely unknown,\r\nbecause it was completely masked during the daytime by the process of\r\nassimilation, which causes carbonic acid to be inhaled and decomposed, and\r\noxygen to be exhaled.[2] In the night time the plants are not assimilating\r\nand the process of breathing is not covered up. It has, therefore, long\r\nbeen known that carbonic acid gas is given off at night. The amount,\r\nhowever, is so small that it could not injure the air of the room, as\r\nis popularly supposed. Respiration takes place principally through the\r\nstomata of the leaves.[3] We often see plants killed by the wayside dust,\r\nand we all know that on this account it is very difficult to make a hedge\r\ngrow well by a dusty road. The dust chokes up the breathing pores of the\r\nleaves, interfering with the action of the plant. It is suffocated.\r\n\r\nThe oxygen absorbed decomposes starch, or some other food product of the\r\nplant, and carbonic acid gas and water are formed. It is a process of slow\r\ncombustion.[4] The energy set free is expended in growth, that is, in the\r\nformation of new cells, and the increase in size of the old ones, and in\r\nthe various movements of the plant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See page 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This table illustrates the differences between the processes.\r\n\r\nASSIMILATION PROPER.

The substance we call protoplasm is\r\nan albuminoid, like the white of an egg, and it forms the flesh of both\r\nplants and animals. A living plant can assimilate its own protoplasm, an\r\nanimal must take it ready-made from plants. But a plant can assimilate its\r\nfood and grow only under the mysterious influence we call life. Life\r\nalone brings forth life, and we are as far as ever from understanding\r\nits nature. Around our little island of knowledge, built up through the\r\ncenturies by the labor of countless workers, stretches the infinite ocean\r\nof the unknown.\r\n\r\n_Gray\'s First Lessons_. Sect.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\'s\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n'
