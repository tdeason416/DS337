Sometimes an\r\nanimal genus is given two chapters, for instance domestic dogs, and wild\r\ndogs.  One grouse: the phrase "well-known" occurs over forty times.\r\nWould the "well-known" fact be well-known to the book\'s intended\r\nreadership?  Probably not.\r\n\r\nThere are a score of very nice illustrations, most showing numerous\r\nanimals of that chapter\'s genus.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nQUADRUPEDS, WHAT THEY ARE AND WHERE FOUND, BY CAPTAIN MAYNE REID.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nI have been called upon to write illustrative sketches to a series of\r\nengravings, designed by an eminent artist.  In performing my part of the\r\nwork I have thrown the _Mammalia_ into twenty-four groups--corresponding\r\nmore or less to the picture designs--and have dwelt chiefly on the\r\ngeographical distribution of the animals.  The _Cetaceae_ and\r\n_Vespertilionidae_ are properly omitted.\r\n\r\nIn the groups given there is no attempt made at any very scientific\r\narrangement.  The sketches are purely of a popular character, even the\r\nscientific nomenclature being avoided.  It is hoped, however, that they\r\nmay prove of service to the zoological tyro, and form as it were his\r\nfirst stepping-stone to a higher order of classification.\r\n\r\nIn reality, notwithstanding the prodigious _speculations_ of learned\r\nanatomists, no truly good arrangement of the _Mammalia_ has yet been\r\narrived at; the deficiency arising from the fact that, as yet, no true\r\nzoologist has had the opportunity of a sufficiently extended observation\r\nof the natural habits of animals.\r\n\r\nNow, however, that the great agent--steam--has as it were "brought the\r\nends of the earth together," the opportunity is no longer wanting; and\r\nit is to be hoped that a better classification may soon be obtained.\r\nWho knows but that some ardent young zoologist, who has taken his first\r\nlessons from this little book, may be the man to supply the desideratum?\r\nWho knows?\r\n\r\nSuch a result would be a proud triumph for the author of these\r\nmonographic sketches.\r\n\r\nMayne Reid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nMONKEYS OF THE OLD WORLD.\r\n\r\nThe great family of the Monkeys, or the "Monkey tribe," as it is usually\r\ncalled, is divided by naturalists into two large groups--the "Monkeys of\r\nthe Old World," or those that inhabit Africa, Asia, and the Asiatic\r\nislands; and the "Monkeys of the New World," or those that belong to\r\nAmerica.  This classification is neither scientific nor natural, but as\r\nit serves to simplify the study of these quadrupeds--or _quadrumana_, as\r\nthey are termed--it is here retained.  Moreover, as there is no genus of\r\nmonkey, nor even a species, common to both hemispheres, such a division\r\ncan do no harm.\r\n\r\nThe number of species of these animals, both in the Old and New Worlds,\r\nis so great, that to give a particular description of each would fill a\r\nlarge volume.  It will be only possible in this sketch to point out the\r\ncountries they inhabit, and to say a word or two of the more remarkable\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nIn point of precedence, the great _Ourang-outang_ contests the palm with\r\nthe _Chimpanzee_.  Both these creatures often attain the size of an\r\nordinary man, and individuals of both have been captured exceeding this\r\nsize; while, at the same time, in muscular strength, one of them is\r\nsupposed to equal seven or eight men.  It is remarkable how little is\r\nknown of the habits of either.  This is accounted for by the fact that\r\nthey both inhabit regions still unexplored by civilised man, dwelling in\r\nthick impenetrable forests, where even the savage himself rarely\r\npenetrates.\r\n\r\nAlthough many exaggerated stories are told of these great satyr apes,\r\nand many of these are only "sailors\' yarns," yet it is easy to believe\r\nthat animals approaching in structure, and even in intelligence, to man\r\nhimself, must possess habits of the most singular kind.  There is little\r\nmore known of them than there was hundreds of years ago--indeed, we\r\nmight say thousands of years; for it is evident that the Carthaginians\r\ncame into contact with the chimpanzee on the western coast of Africa,\r\nand through them the Romans became acquainted with it; and no doubt it\r\nwas this animal that gave origin to most of their stories of satyrs and\r\nwild men of the woods.\r\n\r\nThe chimpanzee is found only in the forests of tropical Africa--more\r\nespecially along the west coast, the banks of the Gaboon, and other\r\nrivers.  The ourang-outang is exclusively Asiatic--inhabiting Borneo,\r\nSumatra, the peninsula of Malacca, Cochin China, and several others of\r\nthe large Oriental islands.  Of the ourang-outang there are two\r\nspecies--perhaps three--differing very little, except in point of size\r\nand colour.\r\n\r\nA group of large tail-less apes, usually denominated _Gibbons_, or\r\nLong-armed Apes, come next in order.  These are neither so large nor\r\nhuman-like as the ourang or the chimpanzee; nevertheless, they are\r\ncapable of walking upon their hind legs, after the manner of bipeds.\r\nThey are all long-armed apes, and generally use their fore-arms in\r\nwalking, but more to assist them in clinging to the branches of trees,\r\nand swinging themselves from one to the other.\r\n\r\nThe gibbons are all Asiatic monkeys, and inhabit the same countries with\r\nthe ourang, viz., the tropical forests of India and the Indian\r\nArchipelago.  There are at least a dozen species of them, nearly half of\r\nwhich are found in the Island of Sumatra alone.\r\n\r\nThe _Proboscis_ monkeys follow the gibbons.  These are also long-armed\r\napes, but with tails and sharp proboscis-like snouts, from which their\r\nname is derived.  Only two species are known--both belonging to the\r\ngreat Island of Borneo, so rich in varieties of these human-like\r\nmammalia.  One of the species of proboscis monkeys has also been\r\nobserved in Cochin China.  Another large tribe of Asiatic apes,\r\ncontaining in all nearly twenty different species, has been constituted\r\ninto a genus called _Semnopithecus_.  These also inhabit the Indian\r\ncontinent and the great islands; but they are not so exclusively\r\ntropical in their habits, since several of the species extend their\r\nrange northward to Nepaul, and other districts among the Himalaya\r\nMountains.  It is a species, or more than one, of these ugly apes that\r\nis venerated by the Hindus; and they are permitted to live without\r\nmolestation in the sacred groves and temples, though they often prove\r\nmost troublesome protegees to their fanatical benefactors.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, the representatives of this last-mentioned tribe are found in\r\nthe _Colobus_ monkeys.  Of these there are about a dozen species; and\r\nfrom several of them are obtained the long-haired monkey skins of\r\ncommerce.  They are all tropical animals, and inhabit the middle zone of\r\nAfrica--their range extending from Abyssinia to the shores of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nAnother very large tribe, containing in all as many as thirty species,\r\nand belonging exclusively to Africa, are the _Guenons_.  They are\r\nclosely allied to the colobus monkeys, but yet sufficiently different\r\nfrom them in habits and conformation to be classed into a separate\r\ngenus.  Most of the guenons inhabit the central regions of Africa; but\r\nthey are not exclusively tropical, since several kinds belong to\r\nKaffraria, and that region indefinitely called the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nThe _Macaco_ apes constitute another genus, which forms the link between\r\nthe guenons and the baboons, or dog-headed monkeys.  They are neither\r\nexclusively African nor Asiatic monkeys, since species of macacoes are\r\nfound in both these continents.  They are usually subdivided into the\r\nmacacoes with long tails, and those with short tails; and there is one\r\nspecies which wants this appendage altogether.  This is the Magot--\r\nperhaps the most noted of all the macacoes, since it was the earliest\r\nknown to European nations, and is, in fact, the only species that is\r\nindigenous to Europe.  It is the magot that inhabits the Rock of\r\nGibraltar.  Much has been written as to whether this monkey is really\r\nindigenous to Europe--some naturalists alleging that it reached\r\nGibraltar from Africa, where it is also common.  But it is not generally\r\nknown that, on European ground, the magot is not confined solely to the\r\nGibraltar Rock.  It is also found in other parts of the south of Spain;\r\nand, it is likely enough, has existed there long enough to claim the\r\ncharacter of a native.\r\n\r\nIn the chain of natural affinities, the _Baboons_, or dog-headed\r\nmonkeys, stand next to the macacoes.  These are more of a quadruped form\r\nthan any yet mentioned; and, both in a moral and physical sense, they\r\nare certainly the ugliest of animals.  The hideous Drills and Mandrills,\r\nso well-known in our menageries, belong to this genus; as also the\r\nChacma, or great dog-monkey of the Cape.\r\n\r\nThere are, in all, seven or eight species of baboons, and most of them\r\ninhabit Africa.  One of the most singular of them, the Hamadryas,\r\nextends its range into Arabia; while another, the Black Baboon, is an\r\ninhabitant of the Philippine Isles.\r\n\r\nWith the baboons we close our list of the Monkeys of the Old World; but,\r\nin order to complete the account of these quadruped mammalia, it is\r\nnecessary to find a place for those strange creatures usually known as\r\nLemurs.  These are usually grouped by themselves, and in a\r\nclassification succeed the American monkeys--to some of which they have\r\na greater resemblance than to those of the Old World; but, as they are\r\nall exclusively inhabitants of the latter, they may appropriately be\r\nnoticed here.\r\n\r\nThe _Lemurs_ are animals having very much the appearance and habits of\r\nmonkeys, but with long snouts or muzzles, resembling that of the fox.\r\nHence they are sometimes called fox-apes.  There are many kinds of them,\r\nhowever; and, although classed in a group called lemurs, they differ\r\nexceedingly from one another, some of them having the appearance of\r\nfoxes, others more resembling squirrels, and still others like flying\r\nsquirrels--being possessed of a similar wing-like appendage, and\r\ncapable, like them, of extended flight.  They are known under different\r\nappellations, as Makis, Indris, Loris, Galagos, Tarsiers, Ay-ays,\r\netcetera, and naturalists have subdivided them into a great number of\r\ngenera.  They are found both in Africa and Asia; but by far the greater\r\nnumber of them, as the Makis and Ay-ays, belong to the Island of\r\nMadagascar.  The last are not to be confounded with an animal bearing\r\nthe same name--the ay-ay of America.  The latter is the singular\r\ncreature known as the sloth, of which there are several distinct\r\nspecies, all inhabitants of the great forests of tropical America.\r\n\r\nOf the lemurs, at least thirty different kinds are known, more than half\r\nof which belong to the Island of Madagascar.  A few species are found on\r\nthe west coast of Africa: and the others inhabit the Oriental islands--\r\nCeylon, Java, Sumatra, Timor, Mindanao, and the Philippine Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nMONKEYS OF THE NEW WORLD.\r\n\r\nThe Monkeys of America differ in many respects from those of the Old\r\nWorld.  In general they are smaller--none of the species being quite so\r\nlarge as the baboons.  Their bodies and limbs are also more slender and\r\nspider-like; and their whole conformation seems intended to adapt them\r\nfor dwelling in the great virgin forests of the New World.  There is one\r\nparticular in which they differ most remarkably from their congeners of\r\nthe Old World; that is, in having _prehensile_ tails.  With these they\r\nare enabled to suspend themselves from the branches of trees, or swing\r\ntheir bodies from one to the other; and this prehensile power is far\r\ngreater than could be obtained by any clutch of the hand.  So great is\r\nit, that even after the animal has died from the effect of a shot or\r\nother wound, its tail will still remain hooped around the branch; and if\r\nthe body is not taken down by the hunter, it will hang there till\r\nreleased by the decay of the tail!\r\n\r\nNot all the monkeys of America possess this prehensile power of tail.\r\nSome are entirely without it, and approach nearer to certain kinds in\r\nthe Old World; while there are a few species that very closely resemble\r\nthe lemurs.  These differences have led to a classification of the\r\nAmerican monkeys; and they have been thrown into three groups, though it\r\nmay be remarked that these groups are not very natural.\r\n\r\nThey are as follow:--The _Sapajous_, whose tails are not only\r\nprehensile, but naked underneath, and tubercled near the tips; the\r\n_Sajoas_, who possess the prehensile power, but have hairy tails; and\r\nthe _Sajouins_, whose tails are _not_ prehensile.\r\n\r\nFor want of a better, this classification may be adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Sapajous are subdivided into three genera, of which the Howlers form\r\none.  They are so denominated from their habit of assembling in troops,\r\nand uttering the most terrible howlings, so loud that the forest is\r\nfilled with their sonorous voices.  Their cries can be heard at a\r\nhalf-league\'s distance, and produce upon a stranger unaccustomed to such\r\nsounds a very disagreeable impression.  The unusual strength of voice is\r\naccounted for by a peculiar drum-like construction of the _os hyoides_,\r\ncommon to all the genera of Sapajous, but more developed in some than in\r\nothers; and those in whom the voice is loudest constitute the genus of\r\n_Alouatles_, or Howlers.\r\n\r\nOf the true howlers there are about a dozen species known to\r\nnaturalists.  Most of them are denizens of the tropical forests of\r\nGuiana and Brazil; but some species are not so tropical in their habits,\r\nsince one or two extend the kingdom of the monkeys into Mexico on the\r\nnorth, and southward to Paraguay.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the last, are the _Ateles_, or Spider monkeys.  These\r\nderive their generic name from their singular spider-like appearance--\r\ncaused by their disproportionately long and slender limbs, and the great\r\nlength of their tails.  None equal them in the prehensile power of the\r\ncaudal appendage; and it is of them that that curious story is related--\r\nthe story of the Monkeys\' Bridge--where it is told how they pass over a\r\nstream: a number of the strongest joining their bodies together by means\r\nof their long tails, and thus forming a bridge, by which the whole troop\r\nare enabled to cross.\r\n\r\nOf the spider monkeys there are about a dozen species; but three of\r\nthese have been taken to form one of the three genera into which, as\r\nalready stated, the Sapajous are divided.  These three differ very\r\nlittle from the other spider monkeys, except in being covered with a\r\nsoft, woolly hair; and, furthermore, in being much more rare than the\r\nothers; at all events, they are more rarely seen, as they dwell only in\r\nthe thickest forests, far remote from the habitations of man.\r\n\r\nThe third and last genus of the Sapajous is that termed _Lagothrix_.\r\nThey are small monkeys, covered also with soft woolly hair; and their\r\nhabitat is along the banks of rivers.  They have a strange habit, not\r\nobservable among their congeners, of collecting in small troops, and\r\nrolling or "clewing" themselves up together.  This they do in cold\r\nweather, or on the approach of a storm.  They summon each other by means\r\nof signals and cries; and selecting the convenient bifurcation of some\r\ntree, they there form the singular group.  The jaguar and other beasts\r\nof prey take advantage of this habit, and often make victims of the\r\nwhole _tableau vivant_!  There are three species already described, all\r\ndenizens of the Brazilian forests.\r\n\r\nThe Sajous form the second group of the American monkeys.  These have\r\nalso prehensile tails; but the power is not so highly-developed in them\r\nas in the Sapajous, nor are their tails naked.  Moreover, the bodies of\r\nthe Sajous are more robust, and their limbs of stouter make.\r\n\r\nThe Sajous are well-tempered creatures, and easily domesticated.  Some\r\nof the species are favourite pets--on account of their pleasing manners,\r\nand the docility of their nature.  The old males, however, scarcely\r\ndeserve this reputation, as they will bite freely enough when provoked.\r\n\r\nThey are not subdivided; but permitted to constitute a single genus, of\r\nwhich there are nearly twenty species--all of them inhabiting equatorial\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe Sajouins form the third group; but as the name merely signifies\r\nthose monkeys that have not the power of suspending themselves by the\r\ntail, it can hardly be considered a natural group, since there are very\r\nvaried and numerous genera who lack this power.  The group of Sajouins\r\nmust therefore be subdivided into several lesser groups.\r\n\r\nFirst of all we have the true Sajouins; and of these the _Saimiri_ or\r\n_Titi_ is the most distinguished species.  This pretty little creature\r\nis about equal in size to a squirrel, and possesses all the playful\r\ndisposition of the latter.  Its childlike innocence of countenance, as\r\nwell as its pleasing and graceful manners, render it a favourite pet\r\nwherever it can be obtained.  Its rich robe of yellowish-grey, mixed\r\nwith green, adds to the attraction of its presence.  There are several\r\nspecies of Sajouins, known as the Widow monkey, the Moloch, the Mitred\r\nmonkey, and the Black-handed Sajouin--all of them dwellers in the\r\ntropical regions of America.  The Doroucouli is another small species,\r\nthat in the nocturnal forest often alarms the traveller by its singular\r\ncry; and an allied species of Doroucouli constitutes, with the one\r\nabove-mentioned, a second genus of the Sajouins.\r\n\r\nThe _Sakis_ form of themselves another and somewhat extensive family of\r\nthe Sajouins.  There are a dozen species of them in all; and they\r\npossess the peculiarity of being insect-eaters.  They are fond of honey,\r\ntoo; and are often seen ranging the woods, in little troops of ten or\r\ntwelve, in search of the nests of the wild bees, which they plunder of\r\ntheir luscious stores.\r\n\r\nThe _Ouistitis_ also constitute a genus.  These, like the Saimiris, are\r\nbeautiful little creatures--many of the species not being larger than\r\nsquirrels, and marked with the most lively colours: as bright red and\r\norange.  There are many different kinds of small squirrels known by this\r\nname, or by its abbreviation--Titi--some of them belonging to the group\r\nof Saimiris, and others to the Ouistitis, properly so called.\r\n\r\nLast of all come the little Tamunus; some of which, in beauty of\r\ncolours, in playfulness of disposition, and other amiable qualities,\r\nneed not yield either to the Saimiris or Ouistitis.  They are equally\r\nprized as pets; and among their Creole owners have equally applied to\r\nthem the endearing appellation of Titi-titi.\r\n\r\nQuadrupeds, what they are and where found--by Captain Mayne Reid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nBEARS.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Linnaeus--that is, a century and a half ago--it was\r\nsupposed there was only one kind of Bear in existence--the common Brown\r\nbear of Europe.  It is true that Linnaeus before his death had heard of\r\nthe great Polar bear, but he had never seen one, and was not certain of\r\nits being a distinct species.  Not only has the Polar bear proved to be\r\na very different animal from his brown congener, but other species have\r\nturned up in remote quarters of the globe: until the list of these\r\ninteresting quadrupeds has been extended to the number of at least a\r\ndozen distinct species--differing not only in size, shape, and colour,\r\nbut also in many more essential characteristics.  Bears have been found\r\nin North America, and others in South America; some in Asia, and still\r\nothers in the islands of the Indian Archipelago; entirely unlike the\r\nbrown bear of Europe, as they are to one another.\r\n\r\nAs the _Brown bear_ is the oldest of the family known to naturalists, I\r\nshall give him the precedence in this little monograph.\r\n\r\nIt is a misnomer to call him the brown bear of Europe, since he is even\r\nmore common in many parts of Asia--especially throughout Asiatic Russia\r\nand Kamtschatka.  But he is also met with in most European countries,\r\nwhere there are extensive ranges of mountains.  In the mountains of\r\nHungary and Transylvania--as well as in those of Russia, Sweden, and\r\nNorway--the brown bear is found.  He is also met with as far south as\r\nthe Alps--and even the Pyrenees, and Asturias, mountains of Spain; but\r\nthe bear of these last-mentioned localities differs considerably from\r\nthe real brown bear of the northern regions; and most probably is a\r\ndifferent species.\r\n\r\nAgain, in North America--in a very remote and sterile region lying to\r\nthe westward of Hudson\'s Bay, and known as the Barren Grounds--a large\r\nbrown bear has been observed by travellers and traders of the Fur\r\nCompany, supposed to be identical with the European bear.  This,\r\nhowever, is a doubtful point; and in all likelihood the bear of the\r\nBarren Grounds is a new species, only found in that desolate region.\r\n\r\nThe brown bear is of solitary habits.  During the summer season he roams\r\nabout, growing fat upon roots, fruits, seeds, and wild honey--when he\r\ncan procure it.  At the approach of winter this animal has the singular\r\nhabit of returning to his den, and there remaining dormant or torpid\r\nthroughout the season of cold.  During this prolonged slumber he takes\r\nno sustenance of any kind; and although exceedingly fat when going to\r\nrest, he comes forth in the spring-time as thin as a skeleton.  The den\r\nis usually a cave or hollow tree; or, failing this, a _lair_, which the\r\nanimal constructs for himself out of branches, lining it snugly with\r\nleaves and moss.\r\n\r\nThe brown bear is a long-lived animal.  Individuals have been known of\r\nthe age of fifty years.  The cubs when first born are not much larger\r\nthan the puppies of a mastiff.  The people of Kamtschatka hunt this\r\nspecies with great assiduity, and obtain from it many of the comforts\r\nand necessaries of life.  The skins are used for their beds and\r\ncoverlets, for their caps, gloves, and boots.  They manufacture from it\r\nharness for their dogs.  From the intestines they make masks for their\r\nfaces, to protect them from the glare of the sun; and they also use the\r\nlatter stretched over their windows as a substitute for glass.  The\r\nflesh and fat are among the most esteemed dainties of a Kamtschatkan\r\n_cuisine_.  Even the shoulder-blades are used as sickles for cutting\r\ngrass.  The Laplanders, also--of whose cold country the brown bear is an\r\ninhabitant--have a great esteem for this animal.  They regard its\r\nprowess as something wonderful, alleging that it has the strength of ten\r\nmen, and the sense of twelve!  The name for it, in their language,\r\nsignifies the dog of God.\r\n\r\nThe _White_, or _Polar bear_, is, perhaps, the most interesting of the\r\nwhole family: not so much on account of his superior size--since the\r\nbrown and the grizzly are sometimes as large as he--but rather from his\r\nsingular habits, and the many odd stories told about him, dining the\r\nlast fifty years, by whalers and Arctic explorers.\r\n\r\nTo describe the appearance of the Polar bear would be superfluous.\r\nEverybody has seen either a living individual in a menagerie, or a\r\nstuffed skin of one in a museum; and the long, low, tail-less body--with\r\noutstretched neck and sharp projecting snout--covered with a thick coat\r\nof white hair, renders it impossible to mistake the Polar bear for any\r\nother animal.\r\n\r\nThis quadruped is more of a _sea_ than _land_ animal.  Sometimes, it is\r\ntrue, he wanders inland for fifty miles or so; but this he does in\r\nfollowing the course of some river or marshy inlet, where he finds fish.\r\nHis usual haunts are along the icy shores of the Arctic Ocean, and the\r\nnumerous ice-bound islands of the great Polar Sea.  There he roams about\r\nover the frozen banks, or floats upon icebergs and drifts; or, if need\r\nbe, takes to the open water, where he can swim with almost the facility\r\nof a fish.\r\n\r\nA proof of his natatory powers is found in the fact that Arctic voyagers\r\nhave observed him swimming about in the open sea full twenty miles from\r\nthe nearest land!  He is equally expert as a diver; and uses this art\r\nfor the purpose of capturing various kinds of marine animals, upon which\r\nhe subsists.  In regard to food, the Polar bear differs altogether from\r\nhis congeners.  He is almost wholly carnivorous in his habits.  Indeed,\r\nwere it otherwise, he could not exist in his icy kingdom--in many parts\r\nof which not a trace of vegetation is to be found.  Fish of many kinds,\r\nbirds, and their eggs, and four-footed beasts--when he can lay his claws\r\nupon them--all are welcome to his palate.  Nor will he disdain to feast\r\nupon the carcass of the great whale--when chance, or the whale\r\nfishermen, leaves such a provender in his way.  The seal is a particular\r\nfavourite with him, and he hunts this creature with skill and assiduity.\r\nWhen he perceives the seal basking upon a ledge of ice, he slips\r\nquietly into the water, and swims to leeward of his intended victim.  He\r\napproaches by frequent short dives--so calculating his distance, that at\r\nthe last he comes up close to the spot where the seal is lying.  Should\r\nthe victim attempt to escape, by rolling into the water, it falls into\r\nthe bear\'s clutches: if, on the contrary, it lies still, the bear makes\r\na powerful spring, seizes it on the ice, and then kills and devours it\r\nat his leisure.\r\n\r\nIn swimming, the Polar bear not only moves rapidly through the water,\r\nbut is also capable of darting forward in such a way as to seize a fish\r\nbefore it can escape beyond reach.  On the land, also, he can move with\r\nrapidity--his slouching trot being almost as fast as the gallop of a\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nIndividuals have been shot that weighed as much as 1600 pounds!\r\n\r\nPolar bears are found along the shores of the Arctic Ocean, both in Asia\r\nand America.  They do not go to sleep in winter--that is, the males do\r\nnot.  The females with young, however, bury themselves in the snow--\r\nhaving formed a lair--and there remain until they bring forth their\r\nyoung.  The cubs are often captured in these snow caves, which the\r\nEsquimaux discover by means of dogs trained for this peculiar purpose.\r\n\r\nThe _Grizzly bear_ next merits attention.  This formidable animal was,\r\nfor a long time, supposed to be a variety either of the brown bear of\r\nEurope or the black bear of America; but his greater ferocity, so often\r\nand fatally experienced by travellers, drew the attention of naturalists\r\nupon him, when it was discovered that he was altogether distinct from\r\neither of the two.  His name is usually coupled with that of the Rocky\r\nMountains of America--for it is chiefly in the defiles and valleys of\r\nthis stupendous chain that he makes his home.  He wanders, however, far\r\neastward over the prairies, and also to the Californian Mountains on the\r\nwest; and in a latitudinal direction from the borders of Texas on the\r\nsouth, northward as far, it is supposed, as the shores of the Arctic\r\nSea.  At all events, a bear somewhat like him, if not identically the\r\nsame, has been seen on the banks of the great Mackenzie River, near its\r\nmouth.  Perhaps it may be the brown bear of the Barren Grounds, already\r\nnoticed; and which last is, in many respects--in size and colour\r\nespecially--very similar to the grizzly.\r\n\r\nThe grizzly bear is certainly the most ferocious of his tribe--even\r\nexceeding, in this unamiable quality, his white cousin of the icy north;\r\nand many a melancholy tale of trapper and Indian hunter attests his\r\ndangerous prowess.  He is both carnivorous and frugivorous--will dig for\r\nroots and eat fruits when within his reach; but not being a\r\ntree-climber, he has to content himself with such berries as grow upon\r\nthe humbler bushes.  Indeed, it is a fortunate circumstance that the\r\nfierce animal is unable to ascend a tree.  Many a traveller and hunter\r\nhave found a neighbouring tree the readiest means of saving their lives,\r\nwhen pursued by this ferocious assailant.  Another circumstance is also\r\nin favour of those pursued by the grizzly bear.  In the region where he\r\ndwells, but few persons ever go afoot; and although the bear can\r\novertake a pedestrian, his speed is no match for that of the friendly\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nIt is almost hopeless to think of killing a grizzly bear by a single\r\nbullet.  There the deadly rifle is no longer deadly--unless when the\r\nshot is given in a mortal part; and to take sure aim from the saddle,\r\nwith a horse dancing in affright, is a feat which even the most skilful\r\nmarksman cannot always accomplish.  As many as a dozen bullets have been\r\nfired into the body of a grizzly bear, without killing him outright.\r\n\r\nThe strength of this animal equals his ferocity.  He pulls the huge\r\nbuffalo, a thousand pounds in weight, to the ground; and then drags its\r\ncarcass to some cave or crevice among the rocks, or to a hole which he\r\nhas dug to receive it.  To this place he repairs from time to time, till\r\nthe exhausted store compels him to go in search of a new victim.  Many\r\nan incident can be related--and on the best authority too--where man has\r\nbeen the victim of the grizzly bear; and the Indians esteem the killing\r\nof one of these animals a feat equal to that of taking the scalp of a\r\nhuman enemy.  One of the proudest ornaments of a savage chief is a\r\nnecklace of bears\' claws: only to be worn by those who have themselves\r\nkilled the animals from which they have been taken.\r\n\r\nThe _Black_, or _American bear_, is one of the best known of the family;\r\nand on account of his clean smooth head, tapering muzzle, and rich black\r\nfur, he is also one of the best looking of bears.  He is found\r\nthroughout the whole of the United States territory--from the Canadas to\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico--and westward to the shores of the Pacific.  He is\r\nsometimes met with in the same neighbourhood with the grizzly, but not\r\noften: since their haunts are essentially unlike--the black bear being a\r\ndenizen of the heavy-timbered forest, while the other frequents the\r\ngrassy hills or coppice-openings of the prairies and mountain valleys.\r\n\r\nThe black bear is a tree-climber; and ascends the loftiest trees in\r\nsearch of the honey of the wild bees, or to make his lair in some\r\ncavernous hollow of the trunks.  His food is usually fruits and roots,\r\nbut he is also fond of young corn, and often commits serious\r\ndepredations on the maize plantation.  In the backwood settlements,\r\nwhere clearings are apart from each other, the black bear is still\r\noccasionally met with; and the chase of this animal is one of the most\r\nfavourite pastimes of the backwoods\' hunter, whether amateur or\r\nprofessional.  Generally there is little peril in the pursuit--unless\r\nwhen the bear is wounded and enraged, and the hunter chooses to risk\r\nhimself at close quarters.\r\n\r\nThere are varieties in colour.  Some with white throats, and some of a\r\ncinnamon brown, have been observed; but the colour of the species is\r\nusually jet black; and on this account the skins are much prized for\r\nmilitary and other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe _Spectacled bear_ is a native of South America, and frequents the\r\nforests upon the declivities of the Andes.  This was long supposed to be\r\na variety of the black bear, but later observations prove it to be a\r\ndifferent species.  Its habits are very similar to the last, to which it\r\nis also similar in shape.  In colour it differs essentially.  It is\r\nblack, but with a buff snout, and buff rings round the eyes, which give\r\nit that appearance whence it derives its trivial name.  Its throat and\r\nbreast are whitish.\r\n\r\nThere is at least one other species of black bear indigenous to South\r\nAmerica, inhabiting the tropical forests; but very little is known of\r\nit--further than that it is one of the smallest of the tribe.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the Asiatic bears, properly so called; and we have only\r\nspace to say a word about each.\r\n\r\nThe _Siberian bear_ is thought to be only a variety of the brown bear of\r\nEurope, differing slightly in colour.  In the former there is a broad\r\nband, or collar, of white passing over the neck and meeting upon the\r\nbreast.  It is, as its name implies, an inhabitant of Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe _Thibet bear_ is a dweller among the Himalayas--in Sylhet and\r\nNepaul.  Its general colour is black, with a white mark, shaped like the\r\nletter Y; so placed that the shank of the letter is upon its breast, and\r\nthe forks running up the front of its shoulders.  It is not carnivorous,\r\nand, generally, its disposition is harmless and playful.  It is easily\r\ntamed.\r\n\r\nThe _Sloth bear_ is another Indian species having this peculiar marking\r\non the breast and shoulders.  This animal is one of the oddest of\r\ncreatures.  Its short limbs and depressed head, with the long shaggy\r\nhair surmounting its back like a bullock, give it the appearance of\r\nbeing deformed.  On this account it was the favourite of the Indian\r\njugglers, who, depending on its ugliness as a source of attraction,\r\ntrained it to a variety of tricks.  It is therefore sometimes known as\r\nthe jugglers\' bear (_Ours jongleur_).  It has also a peculiar prehensile\r\npower in its lips; and this, with its general shaggy mien, led to the\r\nbelief of its being a species of sloth--hence its common name.\r\n\r\nThe _Malayan bear_ is another black species, with a marking on the\r\nbreast.  This mark is of a semi-lunar shape, and whitish; but the colour\r\nof the muzzle is buff-yellow.  This is a very handsome species,\r\nsubsisting on vegetable diet; and very injurious to the plantations of\r\nyoung cocoa trees, of the shoots of which it is very fond.  It is also a\r\nhoney eater; and roams about in quest of the hives of the indigenous\r\nbees.  It is a native of Malacca, Sumatra, and others of the East Indian\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nThe _Isabella bear_ is so called from its colour--being of that fulvous\r\nwhite known as Isabella colour.  It is another of the species belonging\r\nto the great range of the Himalayas, and is found in the mountains of\r\nNepaul.  Sometimes it is observed of nearly a white colour; which led to\r\nthe mistaken belief that Polar bears existed in the Himalayas.\r\n\r\nThe _Syrian bear_ is a species found in the mountainous parts of Asia\r\nMinor.  It is of a fulvous-brown colour, sometimes approaching to\r\nyellowish white.  It is partly carnivorous, but feeds also on fruits;\r\nand is most remarkable as being the species first mentioned in books--\r\nthat is, it is the bear of the Bible.\r\n\r\nThe _Bornean bear_ is the last to be mentioned, though it is certainly\r\none of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful, of the genus.\r\nThis beauty arises from its peculiar markings, especially from the large\r\npatch of rich orange colour upon the breast.  It is a native of the\r\ngreat Island of Borneo, and little is known of its habits; but it is\r\nsupposed to resemble the Malayan bear in these, as it does in many other\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nIn Africa there are no bears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nBADGERS.\r\n\r\nThe Badger is a silent, solitary, carnivorous creature, having his\r\nrepresentative, in some form or other, in almost every part of the\r\nworld; though nowhere either numerous in species or plentiful in\r\nindividuals.  In Europe he appears in two forms, the _Glutton and common\r\nBadger_; in North America in three, viz., _Wolverene, American_, and\r\n_Mexican Badgers_; and, indeed, we might say a fourth belongs to that\r\ncontinent, for the _Racoon_ is as near being a badger, both in\r\nappearance and habits, as he is to being anything else.  For\r\nconvenience, therefore, let us class him in this group: he will\r\ncertainly be more at home in it than among the _bears_--where most of\r\nthe naturalists have placed him.\r\n\r\nIn South America we find another form of badger in the _Coati mondi_, of\r\nwhich there are several varieties; and there, too, the racoon appears of\r\na species distinct from those of the north.  Some writers class the\r\ncoati with the civets, but the creature has far more of the habits and\r\nappearance of a badger than of a civet cat; and therefore, whatever the\r\nanatomists may say, we shall consider the coati a badger.\r\n\r\nBut a truer form of the badger than either of the above, exists in South\r\nAmerica--extending over nearly the whole of that continent.  This is the\r\n_Grison_, which, in appearance and habits, somewhat resembles the\r\nwolverene.  It also is found in two or three varieties--according to the\r\npart of the country it inhabits.  The _Taira_ is another South American\r\nspecies of badger-like animal, though usually referred to the weasels.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, the badger appears in the _Ratel_, or honey badger, common\r\nfrom Senegal to the Cape.  In Asia, in its northern zone, we have the\r\n_European badger and Glutton_; and in the south, the _Indian badger_;\r\nwhile in the Himalaya chain dwells another animal, closely allied to the\r\nbadgers, called the _Wha_ or _Panda_.  In Java, we find still another\r\nspecies, the _Nientek_; and in the other large Asiatic islands there are\r\nseveral kinds of animals that approach very near to badgers in their\r\nforms and habits, but which are usually classed either with the weasels\r\nor civets.\r\n\r\nWe shall now give some details respecting the different animals of this\r\nfamily; among which the Glutton, in point of size, as well as for other\r\nreasons, deserves precedence.\r\n\r\nThe _Glutton_ is the Rosomak of the Russians, in whose country he is\r\nchiefly found--along high northern latitudes, both in Europe and Asia.\r\nHe is supposed to be identical with the wolverene of North America; and\r\nif this be so, his range extends all round the Arctic zone of the globe:\r\nsince the wolverene is found throughout the whole extent of the Hudson\'s\r\nBay territory.  There are good reasons to believe, however, that the two\r\nspecies differ considerably from each other--just as the European badger\r\ndoes from his American cousins.  It was the writer Olaus Magnus who gave\r\nsuch celebrity to this animal, by telling a very great "story" about the\r\ncreature--which, at a time when people were little studied in natural\r\nhistory, was readily believed.  Olaus\'s report was, that whenever the\r\nglutton killed an animal, he was in the habit of feeding on the carcass\r\ntill his belly became swelled out and tight as a drum; that then he\r\nwould pass between two trees growing close together--to press the\r\nswelling inwards and ease himself--after which he would return to the\r\ncarcass, again fill himself, and then back again to the trees, and so\r\non, till he had eaten every morsel of the dead animal, whatever might\r\nhave been its size!  All this, of course, was mere fable; but it is not\r\nwithout some foundation in fact: for the Rosomak is, in reality, one of\r\nthe greatest _gluttons_ among carnivorous animals.  So, too, is his\r\ncousin, the wolverene of America; as the fur trappers have had sad\r\nreasons to know--whenever the creature has come upon a store of their\r\nprovisions.  The name of Glutton, therefore, though based upon Olaus\r\nMagnus\'s exaggeration, is not so inappropriate.\r\n\r\nThe glutton and wolverene are, in fact, very like the common badger in\r\ntheir habits; except that being much larger and stronger animals, they\r\nprey upon larger game.  The reindeer, and other large quadrupeds, are\r\noften the victims of both; and it is even said that they can overcome\r\nthe great elk; but this is not confirmed by the observations of any\r\ntrustworthy traveller.  The young of the elk, or a disabled old one, may\r\noccasionally succumb to them, but not an elk in full vigour, nor yet a\r\nreindeer, except when they can surprise the latter asleep.  Their game\r\nis usually the smaller quadrupeds; and in the fur countries no animal is\r\na greater pest to the trapper than the wolverene or glutton.  A single\r\nindividual will in one night visit a whole line of traps, and rob them\r\nof the captured animals--whether they be polar hares, white or blue\r\nfoxes, martens, or ermine weasels.\r\n\r\nIt is this creature that is usually represented lying in wait upon the\r\nlimb of a tree, and springing upon deer as they pass underneath: but\r\nthis story of its habits wants confirmation.\r\n\r\nThe fur of the wolverene is one of the _staple_ articles of trade of the\r\nHudson\'s Bay Company; though it is more prized among the Russians than\r\nwith us--who esteem it in value as next to the ermine.\r\n\r\nThe _Common_, or _European badger_, need not be here described, since it\r\nis familiar to all.  The same may be said of the two American badgers,\r\nand also that of India, all three of which are very similar in habits\r\nand appearance to the common kind.\r\n\r\nBut the _African badger_, or _Ratel_, merits a word or two.  It is about\r\nthe size of the true badger, and ordinarily lives on small game, as\r\nbadgers do; but, in addition to this, it is fond of varying its diet\r\nwith a little honey.  This it procures from the nests of wild bees,\r\ncommon throughout the whole of Africa.  The account given of the mode in\r\nwhich it finds these nests would be incredible, were it not that we have\r\nthe testimony of reverend missionaries to confirm it.  It is as\r\nfollows:--In Africa there is a bird--a species of cuckoo--known as the\r\nIndicator bird, or honey guide.  This little creature hops from tree to\r\ntree, itself apparently in search of the bees\' nests.  While doing so,\r\nit utters a shrill cry; and these cries are repeated until the honey\r\nhive is found.  The ratel lies in wait for this bird; and, on hearing\r\nthe cry, makes towards it, and keeps following its flights till the\r\nbees\' nest is found.  Should this prove to be in a tree and out of\r\nreach--for the ratel is not a climber--the animal vents his chagrin by\r\ntearing at the trunk with his teeth, as if he had hopes of felling the\r\ntree.  The scratches thus made on the bark serve as a guide to certain\r\nother creatures, who are also fond of honey, viz., the Kaffir hunters\r\nand Bushmen.\r\n\r\nShould the bees\' nest prove to be on the ground, or under it, the ratel\r\nsoon unearths the treasure with his strong claws, and takes possession\r\nof it, regardless of the stings of the bees, against which his thick\r\nskin defends him.\r\n\r\nThe _Orison_ inhabits the forests of South America, from Guiana to\r\nParaguay.  It is quite as ferocious as any of the tribe; but its smaller\r\nsize hinders it from attacking large animals, and its victims are birds,\r\nagoutis, and other small rodents--against all of which it wages a war of\r\nextermination.  When surprised by the hunters and their dogs, it will\r\nbattle furiously till life is extinct: all the while emitting a strong\r\ndisagreeable smell, after the manner of the weasels and polecats.  The\r\n_Racoon_, which we have grouped with the badgers, is both a North and\r\nSouth American animal; dwelling in dense forests, and making its lair in\r\nthe hollow of a tree.  This animal is a good tree-climber, and usually\r\ntakes refuge among the higher branches when pursued.  It is nocturnal in\r\nits habits, but in deep shady woods it may be seen prowling about in the\r\ndaylight, in search of birds and their eggs, small rodents, fish, or\r\nfrogs, all of which it eats indifferently.  There are several distinct\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe _Coati_ is exclusively South American.  This, unlike the racoon,\r\nsleeps at night, and prowls during the day.  It is also an expert\r\ntree-climber, and has a peculiarity in this respect; viz., it descends a\r\ntree _head foremost_, which no other animal of its order can do.  It is\r\nequally as fierce and carnivorous as any of the badgers; and its prey,\r\nas with the _racoon_, consists of birds, their eggs, and small\r\nquadrupeds.  It feeds also upon insects; and will turn over the earth\r\nwith its long proboscis-like snout.  When drinking it laps like the dog.\r\nIn eating, it uses its fore-paws to carry the food to its mouth, though\r\nnot as squirrels and monkeys do.  On the contrary, it first divides the\r\nflesh, or whatever it may be, into small morsels, and then raises these\r\nto its mouth by impaling them on its claws as on a fork!\r\n\r\nIt is not a solitary animal, but prefers the society of its companions,\r\nand usually goes about in troops or gangs.  Its lair, like the racoon,\r\nis the hollow of a tree.\r\n\r\nThe _Panda_ of the East Indies is an animal of very similar habits.  It\r\nis found chiefly along the banks of streams that descend from the\r\nmountains; and subsists upon small quadrupeds and birds--which it is\r\nable to follow to the tops of the tallest trees.  Its name of Qua, or\r\nOua, or Wha, is derived from the cry which it utters, and repeats very\r\noften; and which is well represented by any of the syllables above\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nWEASELS, OTTERS AND CIVETS.\r\n\r\nFortunate it is that the quadrupeds composing this group are all animals\r\nof small dimensions.  Were they equal in size to lions and tigers, the\r\nhuman race would be in danger of total extirpation: for it is well-known\r\nthat weasels are the most ferocious and bloodthirsty creatures upon the\r\nearth.  None of them, however, much exceed the size of the ordinary cat:\r\nunless we include the gluttons and wolverenes among the weasels, as\r\nnaturalists sometimes do, notwithstanding that these animals differ\r\naltogether from them.\r\n\r\nThe _civets_, it is true, are not usually classed with the weasels, but\r\nform a group of themselves; however, they are much more nearly related\r\nto weasels than the gluttons; and where, as in the present case, it is\r\ndesirable to divide the mammalia into large groups, they will stand very\r\nwell together.  In truth, the civets are much nearer in resemblance to\r\nweasels than the otters are; and these two last are generally classed\r\ntogether--the otters being neither more nor less than water weasels.\r\n\r\nWe shall first consider the true _Weasels_: that is, the Weasels,\r\nStoats, Ferrets, Polecats, and Martens.\r\n\r\nThe habits of most of the species are well-known; and all resemble each\r\nother in the exceeding ferocity of their disposition.  It will only be\r\nnecessary to say a word about their geographical distribution, and to\r\nspeak of a few of the more noted kinds.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, five species are natives: the Pine and Beech Martens,\r\nthe Stoat, the Common Weasel (which is the type of the family), and the\r\nPolecat.  The Ferret is not indigenous to the country, but has been\r\nintroduced from Africa, and is trained, as is well-known, for the\r\npursuit of the rabbit--which it can follow into the very innermost\r\nrecesses of its burrow.  The English species of weasels are also common\r\nto other countries of Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nIn the high northern latitudes of the Old World, we find a very\r\ncelebrated species--celebrated for a long time on account of its\r\nvaluable fur--the Sable.  The sable is a true marten: a tree-climber,\r\nand one of the most sanguinary of weasels.  An account of its habits,\r\nand of the mode of hunting it, forms one of the most interesting\r\nchapters in natural history.\r\n\r\nAn allied species inhabits the Hudson\'s Bay territory, known as the\r\nAmerican sable, and another, belonging to the Japanese islands, is\r\ncalled the Japan sable.\r\n\r\nThe Ermine is a species equally famous; and for a like reason--the value\r\nof its beautiful white fur, so long an article of commerce.  The ermine\r\nis neither more nor less than a stoat in winter dress; but there are\r\nseveral varieties of it--some that turn to brown in summer, while\r\nanother kind retains its snow-white covering throughout all the year.\r\nThe ermine is common to Europe, Asia, and North America.\r\n\r\nThe Pekan is a larger species, belonging to North America, and\r\nsemi-aquatic in its habits; while the Vison, or Mink, is a large black\r\nweasel that inhabits the borders of rivers in Canada and the United\r\nStates, where it preys upon fish and aquatic reptiles.\r\n\r\nIn North America there is also a very large Pine marten, so called from\r\nits habit of dwelling in the pine forests--where it climbs the trees in\r\npursuit of birds and squirrels.  This is among the largest of the weasel\r\ntribe.  In California, a new species has been described under the name\r\nof the Yellow-cheeked weasel, and in Mexico another, the Black--faced;\r\nso that North America has its full complement of these sanguinary\r\nquadrupeds.  Nor is the southern division of that continent without its\r\nweasels, as there is one species or more in New Granada, one in Guiana,\r\nand two or three in Chili and Peru.\r\n\r\nIn India, there is the White-cheeked weasel, Hodgson\'s and Horsefield\'s\r\nweasels; and in Nepaul, the Nepaul weasel, and the Cathia.  Further\r\nnorth in Asia, there is, in Siberia, the Vomela, the Chorok, and the\r\nAltai weasel of the Altai Mountains; and no doubt need exist that\r\nanimals of the weasel tribe are to be found everywhere.  Indeed, if we\r\nregard as weasels the various carnivorous quadrupeds of the glutton and\r\nbadger family, which have been described elsewhere in these sketches--\r\nincluding the strange Teledu or Stinkard of Java, the Helietis of India\r\nand China, the Taira and Grison of Brazil, the Ratel or honey badger of\r\nAfrica, the Zorille of the Cape, the Zorilla or Maikel of Patagonia, the\r\nSand bear of India, and the numerous varieties of the celebrated\r\nPolecat, or Skunk, of North and South America--we may well say that\r\nthere are weasels, or their representatives, in every hole and corner of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Polecats of America, they form a sort of link between\r\nthe weasels and civets; and although there was long supposed to be but\r\none kind--as in the case of the opossum--it is now ascertained that\r\nthere are several distinct species, with an endless list of varieties.\r\n\r\nThe _Water Weasels_, or _Otters_, are not so numerous either in species\r\nor individuals--though there are at least a dozen of them in all, and\r\nthey are widely distributed over the world.\r\n\r\nIn Britain, there is but one--the Common or European otter; and in North\r\nAmerica, a very similar species was supposed, until recently, to be the\r\nonly one inhabiting that continent.  The rivers of California, however,\r\nhave presented us with a second, known as the Californian otter; and the\r\nsingular Sea otter, whose beautiful fur is so prized under the name of\r\nSea otter, is also an animal inhabiting the coasts of California--as it\r\ndoes most part of the western seaboard of the American continent.\r\n\r\nThe Grey otter is a South African animal, and in India we have the\r\nWargul; while in the rivers of Nepaul--a country so rich in mammalia--\r\nthere is the Golden brown otter.  China, in common with other\r\nIndo-Chinese countries, possesses the Chinese otter; and South America\r\nhas the Brazilian Contra, and in all probability several other species.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _Civet-Weasels_--or Civet Cats, as they are commonly\r\ncalled--there is a still greater variety, both in genera and species: so\r\nmany, indeed, that, as already stated, they have been arranged in a\r\nfamily by themselves.  They may be regarded, however, as large weasels,\r\ndistinguished from the others by their having a sort of pouch or gland\r\nunder the tail, in which is secreted an unctuous and highly odorous\r\nsubstance.  This, in some species, as in the true civets, is relished as\r\na perfume or scent, while in others it is an extremely disagreeable\r\nodour.  The true civet is a native of North Africa; where it is kept in\r\na tame state, for the purpose of obtaining from it the well-known\r\nperfume of commerce.  An allied species, the Rasse, belongs to Java--and\r\nis there also kept in cages for the same purpose--while in Asia--from\r\nArabia to Malabar, and among the Malays and Arabs of Borneo, Macassar,\r\nand other islands of the Indian Archipelago--still another species of\r\ncivet affords a similar perfumed substance.\r\n\r\nThe Aard Wolf (earth wolf) of South Africa is usually classed among the\r\ncivets, but with very slight reason.  It is far more like the hyena; and\r\nis certainly nothing else than a hyena.\r\n\r\nThe Delundung of Java is a creature that bears a resemblance to the\r\ncivets; and may be regarded as forming a link between these and the true\r\ncats.\r\n\r\nThe Genets constitute a division of the civet-weasel tribe; and one of\r\nwhich there are numerous species.  They are usually pretty spotted\r\ncreatures, with immensely long tails; and but for their cruel and\r\nsanguinary habits would, no doubt, be favourites.  They exist in South\r\nEurope; and, under different forms and appellations, extend over all\r\nAfrica to Madagascar and the Cape--as well as through the countries of\r\nSouthern Asia and the Asiatic islands.\r\n\r\nThe Ichneumons claim our attention next.  These are celebrated animals,\r\non account of the strange and fabulous tales related of the species\r\nknown as the Egyptian ichneumon, which, among the people of Egypt, is\r\ndomesticated, and was once held as a sacred animal.  Besides the\r\nEgyptian ichneumon, there are several other species in Africa--one\r\nbelonging to Abyssinia, and no less than six to the countries near the\r\nCape.  The Garangan of Java is an ichneumon; and so also are the Mongoos\r\nand Nyula of Nepaul; while in the Malay peninsula is a species known as\r\nthe Malacca ichneumon.  The Paradoxure is usually classed with the\r\ncivets, though it wants the perfumed pouch; and the Suricate or\r\nMeer-cat, of the Cape colonists, takes its station in this group.  A\r\nbadger-like animal of Madagascar, the Mangu, is also regarded as a\r\ncivet: so, too, are the Coatis of the New World, though these last are\r\nevidently of much nearer kin to the badgers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the curious creature known as the Potto, or Kinkajou, has more\r\npretensions to a place among the civets: at all events, it deserves one\r\nin the general group of the weasels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nTAME DOGS.\r\n\r\nPerhaps of all other animals the dog has been the earliest and most\r\nconstant companion of man.  His swiftness and strength, but more\r\nespecially his highly-developed power of smelling, have made him a\r\npowerful ally against the other animals; and these qualities must have\r\nattracted the attention of man at an early period--particularly in those\r\ntimes when the chase was, perhaps, the only pursuit of mankind.\r\n\r\nNo animal is more widely distributed over the earth.  He has followed\r\nman everywhere; and wherever human society exists, there this constant\r\nand faithful attendant may be found--devoted to his master, adopting his\r\nmanners, distinguishing and defending his property, and remaining\r\nattached to him even after death.\r\n\r\nIt is a question among naturalists as to what was the parent stock of\r\nthe dog.  Some allege that he has sprung from the wolf; others that he\r\nis a descendant of the jackal; while not a few believe that there were\r\ntrue wild dogs, from which the present domesticated race had their\r\norigin.  These ideas are mere speculations, and not very reasonable ones\r\neither.  It would not be difficult to show, that different kinds of dogs\r\nhave sprung from different kinds of animals--that is, animals of the\r\nsame great family--from wolves, foxes, jackals, zerdas, and even hyenas.\r\nThis can be proved from the fact, that domesticated breeds among savage\r\ntribes, both in Asia and America, are undoubtedly the descendants of\r\nwolves and jackals: such, for instance, as the Esquimaux dog of the\r\nArctic regions, the Dingo of Australia, the Indian dogs of North\r\nAmerica--of which there are several varieties--and also one or two kinds\r\nexisting in Mexico and South America.\r\n\r\nNaturalists deny that there are any true dogs living in a wild state.\r\nThis is simply an unreasonable assertion.  Wild dogs of several species\r\nare to be met with in Asia and America; and if it be asserted that these\r\noriginally came from a domesticated stock, the same cannot be said of\r\nthe hunting dog of Southern Africa--which is neither more nor less than\r\na _wild hound_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps none of the animals that have submitted to the conquest of man\r\nhave branched off into a greater number of varieties than this one.\r\nThere are more kinds than either of horses or oxen.  We shall not,\r\ntherefore, attempt a description of each; but limit ourselves to speak\r\nof those breeds that are the most remarkable--or rather those with which\r\nthe reader is supposed to be least familiar.  To describe such varieties\r\nas the spaniel, the greyhound, the mastiff, or the terrier, would not\r\nadd much to the knowledge which the English reader already possesses.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable of dogs is the huge mastiff of Tibet.  He is\r\nlong-haired, and usually of a jet black colour.  He is quite a match in\r\nsize for either the Newfoundland or San Bernard breeds, and not unlike\r\none or the other--for it may be remarked, that these in many points\r\nresemble each other.\r\n\r\nThe Tibet dog, as his name implies, is the property of the Tibetians:\r\nespecially the Bhootees--the same people who own that curious species of\r\ncattle, the _Yak_, or grunting ox, and who reside on the northern slopes\r\nof the Himalaya mountains.  It may be inferred, therefore, that the\r\nTibet dog affects a cold climate; and such is in reality the case.  He\r\ncannot bear heat; and does not thrive, even in the kingdom of Nepaul.\r\nAttempts to introduce the breed into England have resulted in failure:\r\nthe animals brought hither having died shortly after their arrival.\r\n\r\nThe masters of these dogs--the Bhootees, or Bhoteas, are a singular\r\nrace, of a ruddy copper colour, rather short in stature, but of\r\nexcellent disposition.  Their clothing consists of furs and woollen\r\ncloths, adapted to the cold climate which they inhabit.  The men till\r\nthe ground, and keep yaks and sheep, and sometimes come down into the\r\nwarm plains to trade--penetrating even to Calcutta.  The women remain at\r\nhome, their only protectors being these great dogs, who watch faithfully\r\nover their villages and encampments, and fly fiercely at any stranger\r\nwho may approach them.  It is said that they are especially hostile to\r\npeople who have a _white_ face; but this disposition is also\r\ncharacteristic of the dogs belonging to the American Indians--and\r\nperhaps those possessed by all savages with a coloured skin.\r\n\r\nThe Dingo, or dog of Australia, is an animal domesticated among the\r\naborigines of that country.  He is a dog of wolf-like shape, who does\r\nnot bark, but utters only a mournful howling.  He is used by the\r\nwretched natives both for the chase and as an article of food; and is a\r\nfierce and voracious creature--not hesitating to launch himself on the\r\nlarger kinds of animals.  He is especially employed in hunting the\r\nkangaroo; and sometimes terrible combats occur between the dingo and the\r\nlarger species of kangaroos--resulting always in the death of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe San Bernard dog, supposed to be a cross between the mastiff and\r\nshepherd\'s dog, is too celebrated to require a description here.  His\r\nsagacity in discovering travellers amid the Alpine snows, and guiding\r\nthem upon their path, is the quality upon which the fame of this dog has\r\nbeen founded; but it may be remarked that many of the feats attributed\r\nto him have their origin in the fertile fancies of Parisian writers.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux dog is another celebrated variety.  He is an animal with a\r\nfox-like face and thick coat of whitish hair, generally tinged with\r\nyellow.  He is to the Esquimaux a most valuable companion: trained to\r\ndraw their sledges over the surface of the snow, and enabling them to\r\nmake long and rapid journeys--without which these singular people would\r\nbe ofttimes in danger of perishing amid the inhospitable regions they\r\ninhabit.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of North America possess two or three varieties of\r\ndomesticated dogs, evidently derived from the wolves of that region.\r\nIndeed, the common Indian dogs, found among the Sioux and other northern\r\ntribes, bear so close a resemblance to the large American wolf, that\r\nthey are often taken for this animal, and in consequence shot, or\r\notherwise killed by mistake.  The Indians use them for carrying burdens:\r\ntheir tents and tent poles being transported by these animals on long\r\njourneys across the prairies.  Their flesh is a favourite article of the\r\nsavage _cuisine_; but it is too costly to be used as an every-day food;\r\nand is only served up on grand festive occasions.  Like the dogs of\r\nTibet, these Indian wolf dogs have the greatest antipathy to a white\r\nskin; so much so, that even a friend in that guise can rarely obtain\r\neither their confidence or friendship.\r\n\r\nA smaller kind than the common one is found among certain tribes, and\r\nappears to have derived its origin from the prairie wolf--the jackal of\r\nAmerica--while the Hare Indians of the Rocky Mountains possess a third\r\nvariety; and it is known that still another exists among the tribes of\r\nRussian America.  This last is short-haired and smooth-coated: therefore\r\ndiffering altogether from the Indian dogs of the prairies.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, there are two or three native dogs: found there on the\r\narrival of Europeans.  One is the _Alco_--a dog remarkable for a curious\r\nhunch or protuberance upon the back and shoulders, a thick short neck,\r\nand small pointed muzzle.  He is thinly covered with long hair, of a\r\nyellowish colour.\r\n\r\nAnother singular variety is the dog of Chihuahua and this is, perhaps,\r\nthe smallest of all canine creatures.  Full-grown specimens have been\r\nseen, whose dimensions did not exceed those of the common rat; and a\r\nsingular fact, well authenticated, is, that this dog, when transported\r\nfrom Chihuahua to any other place--even to the city of Mexico itself--\r\ninvariably becomes larger, or degenerates, as the Mexicans have it!\r\nThere is also in Mexico a hairless dog.  It is, no doubt, the same as\r\nthat known by the name of Turkish dog; since this variety came\r\noriginally from Spanish America.\r\n\r\nIn South America, there are several species of native dogs, found among\r\nthe savages of the Orinoco and Amazon.  They are small animals, usually\r\nof a whitish colour: but their owners follow the curious practice of\r\ndyeing them with annatto, indigo, and other brilliant dyes, for the\r\npurpose of rendering them more ornamental!\r\n\r\nWe can only find space to say that there are many other varieties of\r\ndomesticated dogs, almost unknown beyond the countries in which they are\r\nfound.  Such are the _Quao_ of Rhamgur, the Sumatran dog, the _Poull_ of\r\nNew Ireland, the dogs of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego--those of the\r\nSouth Sea Islands; and the _Waht_ that inhabits some of the ranges of\r\nthe Himalayas.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to suppose that there is not a nation upon earth,\r\nhardly a tribe--civilised or savage--that does not possess some variety\r\nof the canine race differing from all the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nWILD DOGS.\r\n\r\nBy _Wild Dogs_, we mean not only several sorts of true dogs, that in\r\ndifferent parts of the world are found living in a wild state; but also\r\nWolves, Foxes, Jackals, Hyenas, and Fennecs--for all these are but dogs\r\nin a state of nature.\r\n\r\nFirst, we shall speak of the true dogs living in a wild state--that is,\r\napart from the society of man.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to go into the often-debated question, as to\r\nwhether dogs were originally wolves, or what species of wolf the dog is\r\ndescended from.  This is all mere speculation, and answers no purpose.\r\nIt is just as likely that wolves sprang from dogs, as that dogs came\r\nfrom wolves; and every one may perceive that two breeds of the dog\r\nspecies are often far more unlike each other--both in appearance and\r\nhabits--than a dog is to a wolf itself.  Again, foxes differ only from\r\nwolves in point of size; and a small wolf is in reality a fox, while a\r\nlarge fox may be equally regarded as a wolf.  Furthermore, the jackal is\r\nnothing else than another form of the same animal--the wolf or dog,\r\nwhichever you choose to term it; and the hyenas but a still _uglier_\r\nshape of the same carnivorous creature.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the true wild dogs--which are not regarded as wolves--we\r\nfind them existing in various parts of the world.  They usually live in\r\ncommunities, and have the habit of hounds--that is, they hunt in packs.\r\nWhether they were originally dogs in a domesticated state, and have\r\nsince seceded from the society of man, is a question which naturalists\r\nare unable to agree upon.\r\n\r\nIn India there are two or three kinds of wild dogs living thus.  One in\r\nthe Deccan--called Kolsun by the Mahratta people--is a reddish-coloured\r\nanimal, nearly as large as the common European wolf.  It dwells in the\r\nforests, far remote from the villages--and of course lives by preying\r\nupon other animals--just as wolves and foxes do.  Again, in the forests\r\nof the Himalaya mountains there is another species of wild dog,\r\ndifferent from that of the Deccan.  It is usually known as the wild dog\r\nof Nepaul, from its being found in many parts of that kingdom.  A large\r\ncommunity of these animals is often met with in the mountain forests--\r\nliving in caves, or at the bottoms of cliffs, where there are deep\r\ncrevices among the boulders of loose rocks, that afford them a secure\r\nasylum when pursued by their enemies.  In these places the dogs sleep,\r\nand bring forth their young; and the puppies are taught to be\r\nexceedingly wary, and not stray far from their dens during the absence\r\nof the mothers.  Indeed, so cunning do they become when only a few days\r\nold, that it is difficult to capture one of them outside its\r\nimpenetrable lodging-place.\r\n\r\nDuring many hours the old ones are abroad, in pursuit of the animals\r\nupon whose flesh they subsist; and, as already stated, these dogs follow\r\ntheir game not singly, but in bands or packs.  In this way, instinct\r\nteaches them that they will have a better chance of success; since they\r\nare more able to head the pursued animal, turn it in different\r\ndirections, and at length run it to the ground.  A curious fact is\r\nrelated of the cunning of these wild dogs.  It is stated that when in\r\npursuit of the larger animals--such as stags and large antelopes that\r\ninhabit the same district--instead of running them down at once, the\r\ndogs manoeuvre so as to guide the game to their breeding place, before\r\ngiving the final _coup_ to the chase!  The object of this is to bring\r\nthe carcass within reach of their young; which, were it killed at a\r\ngreat distance off, would be obviously impossible.  Such a habit as this\r\nwould prove them possessed of something more than instinct; but for all\r\nthat, it may be true.  A fact seems to confirm it: the fact that a large\r\nquantity of bones is always observed in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nthe breeding places--some of these being of such a size as to preclude\r\nthe belief that they could have been carried thither by the dogs\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn Ramghur there is a wild dog called Quao, or Quaw, which lives in\r\ncommunities, just as those of Nepaul; and still another kind inhabits\r\nthe forests of the Island of Sumatra.\r\n\r\nNone of these kinds are to be confounded with the half-wild dogs of\r\nIndia, called pariah dogs; since the latter, although not owned by\r\nindividuals, dwell in the villages, and of course associate with man.\r\nBesides, the pariahs are of no particular breed--there being several\r\nsorts of pariah dogs.  They are merely _outcast curs_, without owners,\r\nthat pick up a living as they best can.\r\n\r\nPassing from India to the tropical countries of America, we find another\r\nsort of wild dog in the forests of Guiana, known as the Koupara, or\r\nCrab-dog.  It is not certain whether these dogs are indigenous to\r\nGuiana, or the progeny of some domestic variety introduced by the\r\ncolonists.  They dwell in small troops or families, of six or seven\r\nindividuals each, and their food is furnished by the _pacas, agoutis_,\r\nand other small rodent animals of tropical America.  They also find\r\nsustenance in several kinds of crabs, which they adroitly capture upon\r\nthe banks of the rivers; and it is from their habit of feeding upon\r\nthese they have derived the name of crab-dogs.  They are easily tamed;\r\nand when crossed with other breeds, a variety is produced which is\r\nesteemed by the natives as the very best kind for the hunting of the\r\nagoutis, cavies, and capibaras.\r\n\r\nThe wild dogs of the Cape country, called _Wilde Hunden_ (wild hounds)\r\nby the Dutch, are usually regarded as near akin to the _hyenas_.  But\r\nthey are more like real wild hounds than hyenas; and their colour--which\r\nis a mixture of black, white, and tan--almost points to them as the\r\nprogenitors of that variety of dog known as the hound.  Their habits,\r\ntoo, would seem to confirm this hypothesis: for it is well-known that\r\nthese animals pursue their prey just after the manner of a pack of real\r\nhounds--doubling upon it, and using every artifice to run it down.  The\r\nnumerous species of ruminant animals--the antelope in particular--are\r\nthe especial objects of their pursuit, and upon these they subsist.\r\nLike the Indian wild dogs, they live in communities--using the burrows\r\nof the wild hog and ant-eater, as also the hollow ant-hills, for their\r\nlairs and breeding places.  Travellers passing across the plains of\r\nSouth Africa have often witnessed the splendid spectacle of a pack of\r\nthese beautiful wild hounds in pursuit of a large antelope, and almost\r\nfancied themselves looking at a stag hunt, with a kennel of real hounds\r\ngoing at full view!\r\n\r\nThe true wild dog of all is that creature so well-known and celebrated\r\nin all our tales of childhood--the _Wolf_.\r\n\r\nTo describe the wolf, or even to give an account of his habits, would be\r\nsuperfluous.  Almost every one is acquainted with the gaunt form, the\r\nshaggy hide, and tierce aspect of this formidable creature; and every\r\none has heard of his fierce and savage disposition: for who is ignorant\r\nof the story of "Little Red Riding Hood?"\r\n\r\nThe presence of this much-disliked animal is almost universal: by which\r\nI mean, that in some form or other he is represented in almost every\r\ncorner of the globe.  You may say there are no wolves in Africa; but\r\nthis is not true: for the hyenas are nothing more nor less than wolves,\r\nand wolves of the very ugliest kind.\r\n\r\nFortunately wolves are no longer found in Britain, though they were once\r\nplentiful enough in these islands; but all over the continent of Europe\r\nthere are still numerous wolves in the forests and mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Common Wolf, that is, the wolf of Europe, is the type of the family;\r\nbut this type offers many varieties--according to the different\r\nlocalities in which it is found.  I shall here notice these varieties.\r\n\r\nFrench wolves are generally browner and smaller than those of Germany;\r\nand the wolves of Russia, Sweden, and Norway are still stronger animals,\r\nand of a more sinister appearance.  These differ very much in colour,\r\nwhich in winter is almost white.  Again, the Alpine wolves are smaller\r\nthan the French, and of a brownish-grey colour; while those of Italy and\r\nTurkey have a yellowish tinge.  Black wolves are not uncommon,\r\nespecially in the Pyrenees of Spain; but whether these, as well as the\r\nothers, are all mere varieties of the common wolf, or whether there are\r\ntwo or three distinct species of European wolf, are questions to be left\r\nto the disputation of systematic naturalists.\r\n\r\nOver all the continent of America, from the Arctic shores in the north\r\nto Tierra del Fuego in the south, wolves are found; and here again there\r\nare varieties in size, colour, and even habits, that may fairly entitle\r\nthe different kinds to rank as separate species.  Most certainly there\r\nare distinct species, for that known as the Prairie Wolf, and also the\r\nCoyote of Mexico, are two kinds that more resemble jackals than real\r\nwolves.\r\n\r\nBesides, other wolves of the American continent, as the Brown Wolf of\r\nMexico, the great Dusky Wolf of the Upper Missouri, the Aguara Dog of\r\nSouth America, the Wild Dog of the Falkland Islands, the Fox Wolves of\r\nPatagonia and Terra del Fuego, the Guazu of Paraguay and Chili, and the\r\nNorth American Common Wolf--are all animals of such different appearance\r\nand habits, that it is absurd to term them varieties of the same\r\nspecies.  In Asia we have just the same series of varieties--that is, in\r\nevery part of the great continent is found some representative of the\r\ntribe, which in reality is no variety, but an original and indigenous\r\nanimal of the wolf kind--such as the Sandgah, or Indian wolf of the\r\nHimalayas; the Beriah, another Indian wolf; and the Derboom, a black\r\nspecies that inhabits the mountains of Arabia and Syria.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the wolf is represented by the hyenas, of which there are at\r\nleast four species--one of them, the common hyena, belonging to the\r\nnorthern half of the African continent, and extending its range into\r\nseveral countries of Asia.  At the Cape, and northward into Central\r\nAfrica, three large species of hyena, and one small one (the Aard wolf),\r\nrepresent the lupine family.  The Jackal, too--of which there are\r\nseveral distinct kinds in Asia and Africa--is only a wolf of diminutive\r\nsize and gregarious habit.\r\n\r\nThis creature is fairly represented in America by the Coyote of Mexico,\r\nand the Barking Wolf of the prairies; and in Asia, upon the steppes of\r\nTartary, by the Corsac.\r\n\r\nEven in Australia, where new mammalia have turned up in such odd and\r\nfantastic forms, the wolf has his congener in that curious creature\r\nknown as the Tasmanian wolf.\r\n\r\nWith regard to foxes, they, like the wolves, are distributed almost\r\nuniversally over the globe; and exhibit a like variety of forms and\r\ncolours, according to the different localities which they inhabit.\r\nTheir name is legion.\r\n\r\nAs the smallest representatives of the wild dogs, we find in Africa the\r\ncurious little creatures known as the Fennecs.  Of these there are also\r\nvarieties; for, although very much alike in habits, the Fennecs of\r\nAbyssinia and those of the Cape are evidently distinct species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nCATS.\r\n\r\nThe Lion is the _king of cats_; though there are some who think that the\r\nTiger has a better claim to the _throne_.  In point of size and\r\nstrength, there is not much difference between these two animals.  The\r\nlion _appears_ larger, on account of his shaggy mane; but specimens of\r\nthe tiger have been taken whose measurement was equal to that of the\r\nlargest lion.  Otherwise, the tiger is decidedly superior in courage, in\r\naddress, and in beauty; in fact, the royal tiger is one of the most\r\nbeautiful of animals; while the lion, notwithstanding the great fame he\r\nenjoys, is among the very ugliest of brutes.\r\n\r\nThese two powerful creatures often meet in the jungles of India, and try\r\ntheir strength in single combat.  It is not decided which is superior in\r\nprowess, since victory is sometimes on one side and sometimes on the\r\nother.  No doubt this depends on the individuals who may engage, for\r\nlions are not all alike, nor tigers neither.  Both differ in strength\r\nand courage, just as men do; and this difference is caused by a variety\r\nof circumstances--such as age, size, season of the year, nature of the\r\ncountry and climate, and many like contingencies.\r\n\r\nRemember that the lion is found both in Asia and Africa, and nowhere\r\nelse.  He inhabits the whole of Africa, from the Cape to the shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean, and there are three well-marked varieties on that\r\ncontinent.  In Asia he is only found in its southern part--that is, in\r\nthe tropical and sub-tropical regions; and there are also two or three\r\nvarieties of the Asiatic lion.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the tiger, he is altogether an Asiatic.  There are no\r\ntigers in Europe, Africa, and America--of course we mean in their wild\r\nstate; and the stories of tiger-hunts in Africa and America, frequently\r\nto be met with in books and newspapers, are the narratives of mere\r\nignorant travellers, who confound the royal tiger with several species\r\nof spotted cats--of which we shall presently speak.  We may add that the\r\ntiger, although exclusively Asiatic, is not exclusively tropical in his\r\nhaunts.  Tigers are more abundant in the hot jungles of India and some\r\nof the larger islands of the Indian Ocean than elsewhere; but they have\r\nalso been observed far to the north of the Himalayan chain on the great\r\n_steppes_ that extend almost to the confines of Siberia.\r\n\r\nTo continue the monarchical analogy; there are four cats that may be\r\ncalled the princes of the family.  These are the _Jaguar_, the\r\n_Leopard_, the _Panther_, and the _Hunting-leopard_ or _Cheetah_.  The\r\nfirst of these is exclusively American; the other three, African and\r\nAsiatic.  They are all four what are termed spotted cats; that is,\r\nhaving black markings on a buff or yellowish ground.  I need not add\r\nthat they are all beautiful creatures.  A superficial observer would\r\neasily mistake the one for the other; and in common phrase, they are\r\nindifferently termed leopards, panthers, and even tigers; but the\r\nnaturalist, and even the _furrier_ knows that they are four distinct\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nI shall endeavour to point out as briefly as possible some marks that\r\nwill enable _you_ to distinguish them.  In the spots we find a tolerably\r\ngood criterion of the species.  Those upon the body of the jaguar are\r\nnot spots, but rather what may be termed rosettes.  So, too, the black\r\nmarkings of the leopard and panther are rosettes; that is, irregular\r\nblack rings enclosing an open space of the yellow ground.  On the\r\ncontrary, the spots upon the hunting-leopard are real spots, of a\r\nuniform black; and, consequently, this animal is easily distinguished\r\nfrom the other three.  He differs from them also in shape.  He is longer\r\nin the legs, stands more upright upon them, and can run more swiftly\r\nthan any of the cat tribe.  In fact, he has a tendency towards the\r\nnature and habits of the dog, and might be appropriately termed the\r\ncat-dog, or the dog-cat, whichever you please.  It is on account of his\r\ncanine qualities that he is sometimes trained to the chase: hence his\r\nspecific name of the hunting-leopard.  He inhabits both Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nBut how are the jaguar, leopard, and panther to be distinguished from\r\none another?  The jaguar easily enough from the other two.  His rosettes\r\nhave a black point in the centre, which is wanting in the rings of the\r\npanther and leopard.  Besides, the jaguar is a larger and more powerful\r\nanimal.  Humboldt and others have observed specimens of the jaguar\r\nnearly equal in dimensions to those of the royal tiger himself; and his\r\nfeats of fierce prowess, in the forests of Spanish America, are scarce\r\neclipsed by those of his congener in the jungles of India.  Human beings\r\nare frequently his victims, and settlements have been abandoned on\r\naccount of the dangerous proximity of the jaguars.  His range in America\r\nis pretty nearly co-terminal with the Spanish territories--including, of\r\ncourse, Brazil and Guiana, and excluding the country of Patagonia, where\r\na smaller species takes his place.  In all these countries he is\r\nmisnamed tiger (_tigre_)--hence the anomalous stories to which we have\r\nalluded.  We may add that there is a _black_ jaguar in tropical America,\r\njust as there is a _black_ panther in Asia.  In neither case is it a\r\ndifferent species: only a variety as regards colour.  In all other\r\nrespects the black and yellow kinds are alike.  Even on the black ones\r\nthe spots are observable in a certain light, being of a deeper hue than\r\nthe general ground colour of the skin.\r\n\r\nThus, then, it is easy to distinguish a cheetah from a jaguar, or either\r\nfrom a leopard or panther; but with regard to these last two, the\r\ndistinction is more difficult.  In fact, so much are they alike, that\r\nthe two species are confounded even by naturalists; and it is yet an\r\nundecided point which is the leopard, and which the panther!  That there\r\nare two distinct species is certain.  The London furrier knows that\r\nthere are two kinds of skins, which he distinguishes mainly by the feel;\r\nbut the learned zoologist, Temminck, has pointed out a difference in the\r\nanatomical structure.  Both animals are natives of Africa, and both were\r\nsupposed to exist in Asia; but it is doubtful whether that known as the\r\nleopard extends beyond the limits of the African continent.  The panther\r\nis that one which is a little heavier in the body, more cat-like in\r\nshape, and of a deeper yellow in the ground colour; but, perhaps, the\r\ntruest distinction is found in the tail, which is longer in the panther\r\nthan in the leopard, and consists of a greater number of vertebrae.\r\n\r\nThe panther is a well-known animal in India and the Asiatic islands;\r\nand, as already stated, there is a dark-skinned variety, commonly known\r\nas the Black Panther of Java.\r\n\r\nTaking the cat family according to size, the next that deserves mention\r\nis the Couguar, or Puma.  This is the panther of the Anglo-Americans,\r\nand the lion (_leon_) of the Mexicans and South Americans.  His colour\r\nis a uniform tawny red, or calf colour; and he is inferior to the jaguar\r\nin size, strength, and courage.  Notwithstanding, he is a formidable\r\nanimal, and has been known to attack and destroy the larger mammalia.\r\nWhen wounded, or at bay, he will also defend himself against a human\r\nenemy; and there have been instances of hunters, both white and Indian,\r\nhaving succumbed to his strength.  His range extends over nearly the\r\nwhole continent of America; but he more particularly affects the deep\r\nshadow of the forests; and, like the jaguar, he is a tree-climber.  He\r\nhas no claim to the title of lion, except from some resemblance in\r\ncolour; and no doubt it was this that led to his misnomer among the\r\nearly settlers of Spanish America.\r\n\r\nThe Ounce comes next.  Of all the large cats this is the least known,\r\neither to naturalists or hunters.  We only know that such a species\r\nexists; that it is a native of Western Asia (Persia, and perhaps\r\nArabia); that it is an animal nearly as large as the leopard or panther,\r\nbut of stouter build and clumsier shape; that it is covered with long\r\nwoolly hair of a pale-yellow colour, and spotted, not so distinctly as\r\nthe true leopards, from which it is easily distinguished, both by its\r\nform and colour.  The name Ounce is from Buffon; but this specific\r\nappellation is also applied to the jaguar of America, the Jaguarundi, or\r\nlesser jaguar of Paraguay, and even to the Ocelot.\r\n\r\nThe _Rimau-dahan_ is one of the most beautiful species of cats.  It is\r\nof a yellowish ground colour, not spotted like the leopard, but marked\r\nwith broad black bands and patches; in other words, clouded.  It is not\r\nso large as either of the species described.  It is a tree-climber, and\r\nlies in wait for its prey in the forks of the lower limbs, where it also\r\ngoes to sleep.  From this habit it derives its name, _Dalian_; which, in\r\nthe Sumatran language, signifies the fork of a tree.\r\n\r\nNot unlike the _Rimau-dahan_, both in size and markings, is the Nepaul\r\ncat: a species, as its name imports, found in Nepaul, in the mountain\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nThe Serval is a spotted cat--black upon a pale-yellowish ground--and\r\nconsiderably larger than the domestic species.  It is a native of South\r\nAfrica; and its skin is prized among the Kaffirs, for making their fur\r\ncloaks or _karosses_.\r\n\r\nThe Ocelot is about equal in size to the last-named, and equally prized\r\nfor its beautiful skin, which is clouded with an admixture of spots and\r\nstripes upon a ground of yellowish-grey.  It belongs to Spanish\r\nAmerica--more especially Mexico: and it is said to have been this animal\r\nthat is represented on the hieroglyphical paintings of the ancient\r\nAztecs.  More probably its nobler congener, the jaguar, which is also\r\nfound in Mexico, is the animal that held this distinction in the land of\r\nAnahuac.\r\n\r\nIn Central and South America there are a great many species of striped\r\nand spotted cats, known generally as tiger cats.  The Ocelot is one of\r\nthese; but there are also the Pampas cats, the Chati, the Jaguarundi,\r\nthe Margay, the False Margay, and many others.\r\n\r\nNumerous species, too, exist in the forests of India; as also in the\r\ngreat tropical islands of Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThere is yet a section of the cat family to be described.  These are the\r\nlynxes, or cats with short tails and long ears--the latter erect, and at\r\nthe tips pointing inward, or towards each other.\r\n\r\nOf the _Lynxes_ three species are found in North America.  The largest\r\nof these is the Canada lynx, which in point of size approaches the\r\nsmaller species of leopards.  The colour of this animal is of a reddish\r\ngrey, with spots very indistinctly marked.  Its fur is long, and its\r\nskins form one of the principal articles of the Hudson\'s Bay trade.\r\n\r\nThe Canada lynx is not found so far south as the United States; but its\r\nplace is there occupied by the Bay lynx--a smaller species, and one very\r\nsimilarly marked, except that the rufous tint on the back and sides of\r\nthe latter is deeper, and the spots more pronounced.\r\n\r\nStill further south is a third species, only made known to naturalists\r\nwithin the last few years.  It inhabits Texas, and is hence called the\r\nTexan lynx.  It is of a darker red than either of the preceding; but in\r\nother respects--size, shape, and habits--it is almost identical with the\r\nBay lynx.  Both range to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nOf the lynxes of the Old World, there is the common or European lynx,\r\nwhich is still found in several European countries; the Caracal, a\r\nnative of Africa and part of Asia; the Booted lynx, also indigenous to\r\nboth continents; the Chaus, belonging to the country of the Mahrattas;\r\nthe Kattlo, a large species, of Northern Europe; the Nubian lynx, of\r\nNorth Africa; and the Southern lynx, a native of Spain.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that there is scarce one of these species of which there\r\nare not two or more varieties, known only to those who have made a study\r\nof the Kingdom of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nRATS AND OTHER RODENTS.\r\n\r\nIn this group we include not only Rats, but a great many other small\r\nrodents, or gnawers, such as Mice, Marmots, Lemmings, Hamsters,\r\nMole-Rats, Jerboas, and Jumping Mice.  The Shrew-Mice and Moles may also\r\nbe classed here--although naturalists separate them from rodents,\r\nbecause their food is not herbivorous, but consists of worms and\r\ninsects.  For all that, there is a certain general resemblance, both as\r\nto appearance and habits, among all these small quadrupeds; which, for\r\npurposes of classification, is, perhaps, of more value than mere\r\ndifference of food, or tubercles upon the teeth; especially, as it can\r\nbe proved, that the sort of food an animal eats, is often dependent on\r\nthe circumstances in which it may be placed.\r\n\r\nOf the _Rats_, properly so called, there are numerous species, as well\r\nas varieties.  Their size is, in general, about the same as the Black\r\nand Norway rats--both of which belong to England, and have been\r\nintroduced, by means of ships, into every country upon the habitable\r\nglobe.  They are said to have come originally from Asia.  There is one\r\nspecies of rat, however, that is much larger than either of these--the\r\nGigantic rat, found in Indian countries, and which in size quite equals\r\na rabbit!\r\n\r\nThe habits of the rats are too well-known to require description.\r\nSome--as the Wood Rat and Florida Rat of America--dwell apart from the\r\nhabitations of man, in the woods; where, instead of living in burrows,\r\nthey construct large nests, by collecting together heaps of sticks,\r\nleaves, and grass.\r\n\r\n_Mice_ may be regarded as only a smaller kind of rats; and of these\r\nthere are many distinct species--both in the Old and New Worlds.\r\n\r\nThe _Marmots_ are, perhaps, the most interesting of the small rodents.\r\nThey stand in a sort of connection with the squirrels, more especially\r\nthe ground squirrels: on the other hand, they resemble rabbits; and they\r\nhave still many points of identity with rats.  They belong to the\r\nnorthern zones of Europe, Asia, and America.  There are three or four\r\nspecies belonging to the Old World; and a great many to North America.\r\nMoreover there is a considerable difference in the habits of these\r\nspecies, which has led zoologists to separate them into several genera.\r\nOne genus, called the Seed-eaters, is a very curious kind.  The marmots\r\nof this genus have a pair of pockets or pouches--one on the outside of\r\neach cheek--in which they actually carry seeds and other articles of\r\nfood to their burrows.  These pouches, when filled, impart to the little\r\ncreatures a most ludicrous appearance.\r\n\r\nThe marmots usually live in large communities--in burrows, as rabbits\r\ndo.  These burrows are sometimes very extensive--especially so, in the\r\ncase of the prairie marmot of America--better known as the Prairie Dog--\r\nwhose _villages_ sometimes cover an extent of many square miles; and\r\nwhose odd social habits have been repeatedly and accurately described by\r\nlate travellers who have crossed the American continent.\r\n\r\nThe _Mole-rats_ are a sort of combination between moles and rats: hence\r\ntheir common name.  One species is found in Eastern Russia; where it\r\nburrows much after the fashion of the mole--living principally upon\r\nroots.  Two other kinds belong to South Africa.  Both these are of large\r\nsize, nearly as big as rabbits.  On the plains, they make extensive\r\nexcavations, which often prove dangerous to the horse and his rider--\r\ncausing the former to stumble.  The Dutch of the Cape know them by the\r\nname of Sand Moles.\r\n\r\nThe _Hamsters_ differ considerably from the marmots in their mode of\r\nburrowing.  They make their underground dwellings very extensive--having\r\na great many chambers and galleries.  In these they collect vast stores\r\nof food--consisting of grain, peas, and seeds of various kinds.\r\nSometimes two or three bushels of provision will be found in the\r\nstorehouse of a single family.  The hamsters do not confine themselves\r\nexclusively to a vegetable diet: since it is known that they will kill\r\nand eat birds, or even small quadrupeds.  In this respect they resemble\r\nthe common rats; and, therefore, it is idle to talk of mere\r\n_herbivorous_ genera of animals.  The hamsters are very fierce little\r\ncreatures: constantly fighting with other quadrupeds, and even among\r\nthemselves; but the polecat is their master and tyrant, and carries on a\r\nwar of extermination against them--following them through the intricate\r\nways of their burrows, and destroying them even in their dens!\r\n\r\nThere are several species of hamsters in Europe and Asia, and also in\r\nNorth America: for the animal known as the Canada Pouched Rat is of this\r\nkind, and so also is the Tucan of Mexico.  So also is that very singular\r\nand beautiful creature, the Chinchilla of South America--so celebrated\r\nfor its soft and valuable fur.\r\n\r\nThe _Lemmings_ are another form of small rodent animals, celebrated for\r\ntheir extraordinary migratory habit; which resembles that of the grey\r\nsquirrels of North America.  There are several species of lemmings\r\nbelonging to the northern section of the Old Continent--in Eastern\r\nRussia and Asia.  One or two are found in North America--in that part of\r\nit known as the Hudson\'s Bay Territory.\r\n\r\nThe _Spinous Rats_ are little animals much resembling ordinary rats; but\r\nwith the peculiarity of having stiff spines growing among their hair,\r\nafter the manner of porcupine quills.  There are several species of\r\nthem: all natives of tropical America.\r\n\r\nThe _Jerboas_ are, perhaps, the most singular of all the rodents.  They\r\nare noted for having the hind legs much longer than the fore ones--in\r\nfact, being shaped very much like the kangaroos--of which they might be\r\ntermed Lilliputian varieties, were it not that they lack the pouch,\r\nwhich distinguishes these curious creatures.  Like the kangaroos, they\r\nuse their fore-feet only to rest upon.  When in motion, or desirous of\r\npassing quickly over the ground, they make use of their hind-feet only:\r\nproceeding by long leaps or jumps, and sometimes springing to the\r\ndistance of twelve or fifteen feet.  Their tails being long and slender,\r\nwere supposed _not_ to assist them in this operation; but an experiment\r\nmade by a cruel Frenchman--that of cutting off these appendages--proved\r\nthat a considerable portion of the jumping power is derived from the\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nAfrica and Asia are the head-quarters of these quadrupeds--the most\r\nnoted species being the Jerboas of Egypt, and the Leaping Hare of the\r\nCape.  They dwell in sandy deserts--burrowing in communities like the\r\nmarmots.  In America there are no true jerboas: they are there\r\nrepresented by the Jumping Mice of Labrador and the Hudson\'s Bay\r\nTerritory; which resemble the jerboas in almost everything except size,\r\nthe jumping mice being much smaller animals.\r\n\r\n_Field Mice_ and _Dormice_ are other kinds of small rodents, differing\r\nfrom the common kind of mouse; but the habits and appearance of these\r\nlittle quadrupeds are well-known.\r\n\r\nThe _Beaver_ and _Musk-rat_, or _Musquash_ of America, are usually\r\nclassed among the rat tribe; but these animals, for many reasons,\r\ndeserve to stand apart and form a group of themselves.  With regard to\r\nthe shrew-mice and moles, there is less reason for separating them from\r\nother mice; and we shall speak of them in this connection.\r\n\r\nThe _Moles_ are known to be the best burrowers in the world: since they\r\ncan pass under the surface of the ground as fast as a man can dig after\r\nthem, or even faster.  In England, the common mole is well-known--too\r\nwell, in fact--for it is the very pest of the farmer; and the damage\r\ndone by it to the herbage is very considerable indeed--of greater amount\r\nthan that occasioned by any other wild animal.\r\n\r\nIn America, where there are several species of moles, their habits are\r\nsimilar; and the common American mole is very like its European congener\r\nin every respect.  But there are two or three species found in North\r\nAmerican countries very different from either; and the most singular of\r\nall is that known as the Star-nosed Mole.  This creature has the\r\ncartilage of the snout extended into five or six branches, that radiate\r\nfrom each other, like spokes of a wheel, or the points of a star--hence\r\nthe name of star-nosed mole.  The use of this singular appendage is not\r\nclearly understood; and, indeed, it would appear to be an obstruction to\r\nthe natural requirements of the animal.  No doubt, however, it has its\r\npurpose--though that purpose be unknown to us.\r\n\r\nThe _Shrew-Mice_ are still another kind of small ratlike quadrupeds.\r\nThey are distinguished by having upon each flank, under the ordinary\r\nskin, a little band of stiff and close hairs, from which an odoriferous\r\nhumour is distilled.  They dig holes in the earth, which they seldom\r\ncome out of until towards evening; and their food consists of insects\r\nand worms.  A species that inhabits the Pyrenees, and also the mountains\r\nof Russia, are called Desmans, and differ somewhat from the ordinary\r\nshrew-mice.  They are aquatic in their habits; and their burrows always\r\nenter the ground below the level of the water.  The Russian species are\r\nusually termed Musk-rats; but these are not to be confounded with the\r\nmusk-rats of America--which last should undoubtedly be classed with the\r\nbeavers.\r\n\r\nIn India, the shrew-mice attain to the size of ordinary rats, and are\r\nthere also called musk-rats, from the fact that a strong odour of musk\r\nis exhaled by them--so strong as to make the place through which the\r\nanimal passes exceedingly disagreeable.  The same is true of the Russian\r\nmusk-rats, but for all that their skins are employed in chests\r\ncontaining clothing: since the musky smell is a good preservative\r\nagainst the moths.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the numerous rat animals above-mentioned, there are still\r\nother kinds in different parts of the world--the names of which would\r\nalone fill many pages.  Hence it is that the study of this section of\r\nthe mammalia is, perhaps, the most difficult of all; and a true\r\nclassification of these small quadrupeds has hitherto proved a puzzle to\r\nthe most expert zoologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nBEAVERS.\r\n\r\nOf true Beavers there is only one species--unless the beaver of the Old\r\nWorld be different from the well-known animal of the American continent.\r\nThis is a question which has been much debated among naturalists; and\r\ncertainly the difference which is known to exist between the habits of\r\nthe two animals would seem to prove them distinct.  The European beaver\r\nis generally supposed to lead a solitary life--burrowing in the banks of\r\nrivers as otters do; but this supposition is evidently erroneous: or,\r\nrather, we should say, its solitary habit is not its normal or original\r\ncondition, but has been produced by circumstances.  It is probable that\r\nif European beavers were left to themselves, in a situation remote from\r\nthe presence of man, they would build dams, and dwell together in\r\ncolonies, just as the American beavers do.  In fact, such colonies have\r\nactually existed in some parts of Europe and Asia; and no doubt exist at\r\nthe present hour.  One has even been found on the small river Nutha, in\r\na lonely canton of the Magdeburg district, near the Elbe.  Moreover, it\r\nis well-known that the American beavers, when much hunted and persecuted\r\n(as they are certain to be whenever the settlements approach their\r\nterritory) forsake their gregarious habit; and betake themselves to the\r\n"solitary system;" just as their European cousins have done.  Did this\r\nconstitute the only difference between the beavers of the Old and New\r\nWorlds, we might regard them as one and the same; but there are other\r\nand still more important points of distinction--reaching even to their\r\nanatomical structure--which seem to prove them distinct species.  The\r\nprobability is in favour of this view: since there is perhaps no\r\nindigenous quadruped of the one continent exactly identical with its\r\nsynonymous species of the other; excepting the polar bears, and a few\r\nother kinds--whose arctic range leads them, as it were, all round the\r\nearth.  The written natural history of the beaver is usually that of the\r\nAmerican species; not that this differs materially from his European\r\ncongener, but simply because it has been more extensively and accurately\r\nobserved.  Its valuable fur has long rendered it an object of the chase;\r\nand for fifty years it has been hunted _a l\'outrance_, and, in fact,\r\nexterminated from a wide domain of more than a million of square miles.\r\nFormerly, its range extended from the Gulf of Mexico almost to the\r\nshores of the Arctic Sea, and latitudinally from ocean to ocean.  At\r\npresent, it is not found in the territory of the United States proper,\r\nexcept in remote and solitary situations, among the mountains, or in\r\nsome tracts still unsettled.  Even where found in these places, its mode\r\nof life approximates more to that of the European species; that is, it\r\nburrows instead of builds.  The beaver has been long reputed as the most\r\nsagacious of quadrupeds.  True it is, that the capacity of cutting down\r\ntrees--often a foot or more in diameter--floating or rafting these trees\r\ndown a stream, and constructing a dam with them, and afterwards building\r\nits singular houses or lodges in the water, would seem to indicate the\r\npresence of a rational power.  But there are many other creatures--\r\nbirds, insects, and quadrupeds--that exhibit instincts quite as\r\nsurprising.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the habits of the beaver are curious in the extreme, and\r\ndeserve to be given in detail.  The best account of them is that of the\r\nold and truthful traveller Hearne: upon whose homely but accurate\r\nobservations scores of fireside naturalists have established a measure\r\nof their fame.  We shall leave _him_ to tell the story of these singular\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n"The beavers," he says, "being so plentiful, the attention of my\r\ncompanions was chiefly engaged on them, as they not only furnished\r\ndelicious food, but their skins proved a valuable acquisition,--being a\r\nprincipal article of trade, as well as a serviceable one for clothing.\r\nThe situation of the beaver-houses are various.  Where the beavers are\r\nnumerous, they are found to inhabit lakes, ponds, and rivers, as well as\r\nthose narrow creeks which connect the numerous lakes with which this\r\ncountry abounds; but the two latter are generally chosen by them when\r\nthe depth of water and other circumstances are suitable, as they have\r\nthen the advantage of a current to convey wood and other necessaries to\r\ntheir habitations; and because, in general, they are more difficult to\r\nbe taken than those that build in standing water.  They always choose\r\nthose parts that have such a depth of water as will resist the frost in\r\nwinter, and prevent it from freezing to the bottom.  The beavers that\r\nbuild their houses in small rivers or creeks, in which water is liable\r\nto be drained off when the back supplies are dried up by the frost, are\r\nwonderfully taught by instinct to provide against that evil by making a\r\ndam quite across the river, at a convenient distance from their houses.\r\nThe beaver-dams differ in shape, according to the nature of the place in\r\nwhich they are built.  If the water in the river or creek have but\r\nlittle motion, the dam is almost straight; but when the current is more\r\nrapid, it is always made with a considerable curve, convex towards the\r\nstream.  The materials made use of are drift-wood, green willows, birch,\r\nand poplars if they can be got; also mud and stones, intermixed in such\r\na manner as must evidently contribute to the strength of the dam; but\r\nthere is no other order or method observed in the dams, except that of\r\nthe work being carried on with a regular sweep, and all the parts being\r\nmade of equal strength.  In places which have been long frequented by\r\nbeavers undisturbed, their dams, by frequent repairing, become a solid\r\nbank, capable of resisting a great force both of water and ice; and as\r\nthe willow, poplar, and birch generally take root and shoot up, they by\r\ndegrees form a regular planted hedge, which I have seen in some places\r\nso tall, that birds have built their nests among the branches.\r\n\r\n"The beaver-houses are built of the same materials as their dams, and\r\nare always proportioned in size to the number of inhabitants, which\r\nseldom exceeds four old and six to eight young ones; though, by chance,\r\nI have seen above double the number.  Instead of order or regulation\r\nbeing observed in rearing their houses, they are of a much ruder\r\nstructure than their dams; for, notwithstanding the sagacity of these\r\nanimals, it has never been observed that they aim at any other\r\nconvenience in their houses than to have a dry place to lie on; and\r\nthere they usually eat their victuals, which they occasionally take out\r\nof the water.  It frequently happens that some of the large houses are\r\nfound to have one or more partitions (if they deserve that appellation),\r\nbut it is no more than a part of the main building left by the sagacity\r\nof the beaver to support the roof.  On such occasions it is common for\r\nthese different apartments, as some are pleased to call them, to have no\r\ncommunication with each other but by water; so that, in fact, they may\r\nbe called double or treble houses, rather than different apartments of\r\nthe same house.  I have seen a large beaver-house built in a small\r\nisland that had near a dozen apartments under one roof; and, two or\r\nthree of these only excepted, none of them had any communication with\r\neach other but by water.  As there were beavers enough to inhabit each\r\napartment, it is more than probable that each family knew their own, and\r\nalways entered at their own door, without any further connection with\r\ntheir neighbours than a friendly intercourse, and to join their united\r\nlabours in erecting their separate habitations, and building their dams\r\nwhere required.  Travellers who assert that the beavers have two doors\r\nto their houses--one on the land side, and the other next the water--\r\nseem to be less acquainted with these animals than others who assign\r\nthem an elegant suite of apartments.  Such a construction would render\r\ntheir houses of no use, either to protect them from their enemies, or\r\nguard them against the extreme cold of winter.\r\n\r\n"So far are the beavers from driving stakes into the ground when\r\nbuilding their houses, that they lay most of the wood crosswise, and\r\nnearly horizontal, and without any other variation than that of leaving\r\na hollow or cavity in the middle.  When any unnecessary branches project\r\ninward they cut them off with their teeth, and throw them in among the\r\nrest, to prevent the mud from falling through the roof.  It is a\r\nmistaken notion that the woodwork is first completed and then plastered;\r\nfor the whole of their houses, as well as their dams, are, from the\r\nfoundation, one mass of mud and wood, mixed with stones, if they can be\r\nprocured.  The mud is always taken from the edge of the bank, or the\r\nbottom of the creek or pond near the door of the house; and though their\r\nfore-paws are so small, yet it is held close up between them under their\r\nthroat: thus they carry both mud and stones, while they always drag the\r\nwood with their teeth.  All their work is executed in the night, and\r\nthey are so expeditious, that in the course of one night I have known\r\nthem to have collected as much as amounted to some thousands of their\r\nlittle handfuls.  It is a great piece of policy in these animals to\r\ncover the outside of their houses every fall with fresh mud, and as late\r\nas possible in the autumn, even when the frost becomes pretty severe, as\r\nby this means it soon freezes as hard as a stone, and prevents their\r\ncommon enemy, the wolverene, from disturbing them during the winter; and\r\nas they are frequently seen to walk over their work, and sometimes to\r\ngive a flap with their tail, particularly when plunging into the water,\r\nthis has, without doubt, given rise to the vulgar opinion that they use\r\ntheir tails as a trowel, with which they plaster their houses; whereas\r\nthat flapping of the tail is no more than a custom which they always\r\npreserve, even when they become tame and domestic, and more particularly\r\nso when they are startled.\r\n\r\n"Their food consists of a large root, something resembling a\r\ncabbage-stalk, which grows at the bottom of the lakes and rivers.  They\r\nalso eat the bark of trees, particularly those of the poplar, birch, and\r\nwillow; but the ice preventing them from getting to the land in the\r\nwinter, they have not any bark to feed on in that season, except that of\r\nsuch sticks as they cut down in summer, and throw into the water\r\nopposite the doors of their houses; and as they generally eat a great\r\ndeal, the roots above-mentioned constitute a principal part of their\r\nfood during the winter.  In summer they vary their diet by eating\r\nvarious kinds of herbage, and such berries as grow near their haunts\r\nduring that season.  When the ice breaks up in the spring the beavers\r\nalways leave their houses, and rove about until a little before the fall\r\nof the leaf, when they return again to their old habitations, and lay in\r\ntheir winter-stock of wood.  They seldom begin to repair their houses\r\ntill the frost commences, and never finish the outer coat till the cold\r\nis pretty severe, as has been already mentioned.  When they erect a new\r\nhabitation they begin felling the wood early in the summer, but seldom\r\nbegin to build until the middle or latter end of August, and never\r\ncomplete it till the cold weather be set in.\r\n\r\n"Persons who attempt to take beavers in winter should be thoroughly\r\nacquainted with their manner of life; otherwise they will have endless\r\ntrouble to effect their purpose, because they have always a number of\r\nholes in the banks, which serve them as places of retreat when any\r\ninjury is offered to their houses, and in general it is in those holes\r\nthat they are taken.  When the beavers which are situated in a small\r\nriver or creek are to be taken, the Indians sometimes find it necessary\r\nto stake the river across to prevent them from passing; after which they\r\nendeavour to find out all their holes or places of retreat in the bank.\r\nThis requires much practice and experience to accomplish, and is\r\nperformed in the following manner:--Every man being furnished with an\r\nice-chisel, lashes it to the end of a small staff about four to five\r\nfeet long; he then walks along the edge of the banks, and keeps knocking\r\nhis chisel against the ice.  Those who are acquainted with that kind of\r\nwork well know by the sound of the ice when they are opposite to any of\r\nthe beavers\' holes or vaults.  As soon as they suspect any, they cut a\r\nhole through the ice big enough to admit an old beaver; and in this\r\nmanner proceed till they have found out all their places of retreat, or\r\nat least as many of them as possible.  While the principal men are thus\r\nemployed, some of the under-strappers and the women are busy in breaking\r\nopen the house--which at times is no easy task, for I have frequently\r\nknown these houses to be five or six feet thick; and one, in particular,\r\nwas more than eight feet thick in the crown.  When the beavers find that\r\ntheir habitations are invaded, they fly to their holes in the banks for\r\nshelter; and on being perceived by the Indians, which is easily done, by\r\nattending to the motion of the water, they block up the entrance with\r\nstakes of wood, and then haul the beaver out of its hole, either by\r\nhand, if they can reach it, or with a large hook made for that purpose,\r\nwhich is fastened to the end of a long stick.  The beaver is an animal\r\nwhich cannot keep long under at a time; so that when their houses are\r\nbroken open, and all their places of retreat discovered, they have but\r\none choice left, as it may be called--either to be taken in their house\r\nor their vaults; in general they prefer the latter; for where there is\r\none beaver caught in the house, many thousands are taken in the vaults\r\nin the banks.  Sometimes they are caught in nets, and, in summer, very\r\nfrequently in traps.\r\n\r\n"In respect to the beavers dunging in their houses, as some persons\r\nassert, it is quite wrong, as they always plunge into water to do it.  I\r\nam the better enabled to make this assertion, from having kept several\r\nof them till they became so domesticated as to answer to their name, and\r\nfollow those to whom they were accustomed in the same manner as a dog\r\nwould do; and they were as much pleased at being fondled as any animal I\r\never saw.  In cold weather they were kept in my own sitting-room, where\r\nthey were the constant companions of the Indian women and children; and\r\nwere so fond of their company, that when the Indians were absent for any\r\nconsiderable time, the beavers discovered great signs of uneasiness, and\r\non their return showed equal marks of pleasure, by fondling on them,\r\ncrawling into their laps, lying on their backs, sitting erect like a\r\nsquirrel, and behaving like children who see their parents but seldom.\r\nIn general, during the winter, they lived on the same food as the women\r\ndid; and were immoderately fond of rice and plum-pudding; they would eat\r\npartridges and fresh venison very freely; but I never tried them with\r\nfish, though I have heard they will at times prey on them.  In fact,\r\nthere are few graminivorous animals that may not be brought to be\r\ncarnivorous."\r\n\r\nThe _Musquash_, or _Musk-rat_, is undoubtedly a beaver, and has been\r\ncalled at times the Little Beaver; but it has pleased the naturalists to\r\nconstitute it a genus of itself, though there is only the one species\r\nknown.  Its habits are extremely like those of the beaver: it is\r\naquatic, or amphibious, if you please--building itself a conical house\r\nin the midst of a swamp, or low islet, and feeding on shoots of trees,\r\nbits of green wood, leaves and stalks of nettles, and other herbaceous\r\nplants.  Its fur bears a very great resemblance to that of the beaver,\r\nonly it is shorter, and therefore less valuable.  Notwithstanding this,\r\nit is an article of extensive commerce; and upwards of a million skins\r\nhave been imported into England in a single year.  The musquash might\r\nalso be exterminated like the beaver; but being a smaller creature, and\r\ntherefore less persecuted by the amateur sportsman, it is still common\r\nenough upon the streams of the northern and middle States of America.\r\nFurther north it is plentiful; and the Hudson\'s Bay Company procure a\r\nvast number of skins for annual exportation to Europe.  Its name of\r\nmusk-rat is derived from the scent of musk which the animal emits, and\r\nwhich is especially powerful during the season of rut.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the musk-rat of Siberia, as well as several species\r\nof water-rats belonging to South America--and known vaguely by the name\r\nof Lutras and Nutrias--may be animals of the beaver kind, rather than\r\nWater-Rats or Otters, among which they are generally classed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nSQUIRRELS.\r\n\r\nThese pretty little animals are widely distributed over the earth;\r\nthough to this remark Australia seems to form an exception, since no\r\nspecies has yet been discovered there.  However, there is much of that\r\ngreat island continent yet to be explored; and perhaps it may turn out\r\nthat Australia has its squirrels, as well as other parts of the world--\r\nno doubt squirrels with pouches.\r\n\r\nIn number of species--and also of individuals, it may be added--America\r\nexcels all other countries, and the great forests of North America may\r\nbe regarded as the head-quarters of the squirrel tribe; but, if we give\r\nprecedence to size, the squirrels of the East Indian countries are\r\nentitled to the first place.\r\n\r\nAnimals known as Squirrels are of three very distinct kinds--viz.,\r\nSquirrels, properly so called; Ground Squirrels: and Flying Squirrels.\r\nThese three kinds are very naturally separated into three different\r\ngenera; but the closet naturalists, not content with this simple\r\ndivision, have again subdivided them into other sub-genera, using very\r\ndifficult names to distinguish them.  In our little sketch we shall\r\nsimply call them by the three names above-mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe _Squirrels_, properly so called, are not only tree-climbers, but, as\r\nevery one knows, dwell habitually upon trees, and there make their nests\r\nand their home.  And perfectly at home they are among the highest\r\nbranches; for under no circumstances do they ever miss their footing, or\r\nare they in the slightest danger of falling.  In fact, they can not only\r\nrun with the greatest agility along the branches, but equally well with\r\ntheir backs downward; and can spring from branch to branch, and also\r\nfrom tree to tree, over wide intervals of many yards.  They can also\r\nleap down from the tops of the tallest trees to the earth--a feat often\r\nwitnessed by squirrel-hunters--and do so without the appearance of\r\nhaving received the slightest injury; for, without pausing a moment on\r\nthe ground, they continue their flight towards some other tree, where\r\nthey expect to find better shelter from the short gun or rifle of their\r\nhuman enemy.\r\n\r\nThe squirrel builds a nest in the tree, similar to that of some birds;\r\nbut they have also in the same tree a more secure retreat in case of\r\nbeing pursued.  This is a hole in the trunk or one of the larger limbs--\r\nsome natural excavation caused by the decaying of a branch--in short,\r\nwhat is termed a "knot hole," which is common in many kinds of timber.\r\nIn this hole the squirrel usually lays up its store of winter food,\r\nconsisting of nuts, beech-mast, etcetera; and here it takes refuge when\r\nhunted, finding the tree-cave a safe asylum.  Unless decoyed out again,\r\nor, which often happens, _frightened_ out again, by rubbing the trunk\r\nwith a piece of stick, the squirrel must escape scot-free nine times out\r\nof ten, since no hunter would think of felling a huge tree to procure so\r\ninsignificant a reward as the carcass of a squirrel; and without felling\r\nthe tree, and splitting it up, too, the creature could not be reached.\r\nVarious devices, however, are practised to decoy it forth; and these,\r\nunfortunately for the little refugee, too often succeed.\r\n\r\nThe squirrels are the life of the American woods--indeed, a journey\r\nthrough these great forests would often be very monotonous were it not\r\nenlivened by the presence and gambols of these beautiful creatures; and\r\nin the depth of winter, when the squirrels keep within their dark\r\ntree-caves, the solitude of the forest seems redoubled.  But even during\r\nfrost and snow, when the weather is fine and the sun shining brightly, a\r\nfew will be seen venturing forth, as if to take an airing.\r\n\r\nA great many species exist in the forests of North America; sometimes\r\nonly one, and sometimes several, occupy the same district.  They are of\r\ndifferent colours and sizes--some as small as the common squirrel of\r\nEngland, while several species are three or four times as large.  Some\r\nare grey, others brown grey, several species of a fox red, and those\r\nesteemed the most beautiful are of a uniform jet black.  Several new\r\nspecies have lately been found in the forests of Oregon and California.\r\n\r\nTheir habits are all nearly alike; but to one species of Grey Squirrel\r\nbelongs a habit as distinct as it is singular.  This is their habit of\r\ncollecting together in immense flocks of many thousands, and migrating\r\nover vast tracts of country, crossing broad rapid rivers, and staying at\r\nno obstacle.  The object of this migration is not known, only that it\r\nappears to be the result of some impulse--such as excites to a similar\r\nmovement the springboks of South Africa, the buffaloes of North America,\r\nand the passenger pigeons.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the squirrel is represented by the Common Squirrel of our own\r\nwoods, and which is found throughout the whole of Northern Europe and\r\nAsia, wherever there are trees.  Although of a reddish colour in\r\nEngland, as well as in France, it assumes different hues, according to\r\nthe different countries it inhabits; and in the more northern latitudes\r\nit is quite grey.  Another European species, distinct from the English\r\nsquirrel, is a denizen of the Pyrenees and the Alps of Dauphine.\r\n\r\nThe Palm Squirrel is a beautiful species belonging to the tropical parts\r\nof Africa and India, and dwelling principally upon the palm trees--as\r\nits name imports.\r\n\r\nAnother, known as the Barbary Squirrel, belongs to North Africa, and is\r\nalso a dweller upon palm trees.\r\n\r\nThe largest, and perhaps the most richly-coated of the tribe, is the\r\nMalabar Squirrel of India, which is as large as a domestic cat.  It also\r\nhaunts among palm trees, and is fond of the milk of the cocoa-nut,\r\neither in a liquid or solid state.\r\n\r\nThere are squirrels also in Eastern Africa.  India has several species,\r\nand the great islands of Madagascar, Ceylon, Java, Borneo, Sumatra,\r\netcetera, have each one or more species of large and beautiful\r\nsquirrels.\r\n\r\nThe _Ground Squirrels_ differ from the true squirrels in several\r\nrespects, though the chief difference lies in the fact that the former\r\nmake their nest or lair upon the ground, while the latter universally\r\nlodge themselves aloft among the branches.  The Ground Squirrels can\r\nclimb, and appear to ascend trees almost as nimbly as their congeners;\r\nbut they rarely do so unless when pursued, and then but seldom go beyond\r\nthe lower forks or branches.  Their nest is usually in some hole or\r\ncavity among the roots, though several species have been lately\r\ndiscovered in rocky regions, dwelling in the crevices of rocks.  They\r\napproach in habits to the marmot tribe, and seem to link the tree\r\nsquirrels with these last.  Usually, these ground squirrels are striped\r\nlongitudinally with black, red, and white stripes, giving them a fine\r\nappearance; and the species are of different dimensions, from that of\r\nthe ordinary squirrel to the size of a mouse.  In America, for a long\r\ntime, but one kind was supposed to exist; but latterly a great number of\r\nspecies have been observed and described: denizens of the far West--of\r\nthe prairies, and remote valleys of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe African species of ground squirrel, already mentioned as the Palm\r\nSquirrel, has its dwelling among the palm trees, on the fruit and roots\r\nof which--especially that of the date-palm--it subsists.  It is also an\r\ninhabitant of India, where there is at least one other species of palm\r\nground squirrel.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, and throughout the whole of Northern Asia, the ground\r\nsquirrels are represented by the _burunduk_--a very interesting little\r\nspecies, quite similar in habits to those of North America.\r\n\r\nThe _Flying Squirrels_ are the last of the group.  These are the most\r\nsingular of all, and resemble great bats more than squirrels.  They\r\npossess the power, not exactly of flight, but of making very long leaps\r\nfrom a higher to a lower level, so long that they might almost be\r\nregarded as flights.  They can pass from one tree to another standing\r\nmore than a hundred yards apart, and this without descending more than a\r\nfew feet below the level from which they started.  This feat they are\r\nenabled to perform by means of a broad membrane that extends from the\r\nskin of their fore-legs to that of their thighs, and which, when\r\nstretched out, endows them with the properties of a parachute.  Their\r\nbodies, too, have a flattened shape like the bats; and this also helps\r\nto sustain them in the air.\r\n\r\nThey are true squirrels, however, living upon trees, as the common\r\nsquirrels do, and looking very like the latter, notwithstanding their\r\nwinged legs.  In one point, however, they differ essentially from the\r\ncommon squirrels; and that is, they are _nocturnal_ in their habits.  In\r\nthe daytime they are never seen, except by accident; but in the\r\ntwilight, and during a clear night, they may be observed making their\r\nlong leaps from tree to tree, through the glades or along the edges of\r\nthe forest.  There are several species inhabiting the forests of\r\nAmerica, and of late California has yielded several new ones.  In the\r\ntropical forests of America there are several large species, and the Old\r\nWorld has its flying squirrel in the Polatouka, which inhabits the pine\r\nforests of Northern Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nThe largest species of these singular quadrupeds appears to belong to\r\nthe Oriental Islands--to Java, Sumatra, the Philippines, and Moluccas,\r\nor Spice Islands, as also to Japan.  The great Teguan, or flying\r\nsquirrel of the Moluccas, is in reality as large as a cat!\r\n\r\nThe singular Ay-ay of Madagascar is sometimes classed among the\r\nsquirrels and sometimes among the lemurs.  It certainly bears a great\r\nresemblance to the squirrel family; but the habits of all animals\r\nbelonging to Madagascar are so little known that it is difficult to\r\nassign them to that exact genus in which Nature intended they should be\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nHARES, RABBITS, AND OTHER RODENTS.\r\n\r\nThe Hare, and its very near congener, the Rabbit, are animals too\r\nwell-known to need description; but it is necessary to say that, besides\r\nthe species of both, peculiar to Great Britain, there are many other\r\nkinds in other parts of the world.  Even in Britain itself, including\r\nIreland, there are several distinct sorts both of hares and rabbits; for\r\nthe Irish hare is distinct, being a larger, stronger, and even swifter\r\nanimal than the English hare, and having many other points peculiar to\r\nit.  Moreover, in the northern and mountainous parts of Scotland there\r\nis found the Varying or Alpine Hare, whose fur changes in the winter\r\nseason to a snowy whiteness.  But I may here remark, that the Irish hare\r\nalso possesses this singular power of transformation, since upon the\r\nmountains of the north, especially upon the Mourne range, in county\r\nDown, _white_ hares have been frequently observed.  Is this the Irish\r\nhare turned white, or the true Alpine hare of Pallas?\r\n\r\nHares and rabbits are peculiarly the denizens of cold countries, as\r\ntheir warm woolly covering would plainly indicate.  In tropical climates\r\ntheir place is supplied by other kinds of rodents, that resemble them in\r\nhabits, if not in "dress."  Of these other animals we shall presently\r\nspeak.  To the above remark, however a few partial exceptions may be\r\nbrought forward; since there is a species existing in Egypt known as the\r\nEgyptian Hare, and there are three others at the Cape--the Rock Hare,\r\nthe Burrow Hare, and the Vlakte Haas.  These, however, differ very\r\nconsiderably from the common hares and rabbits of northern countries;\r\nand the remark still holds good, that in the tropics--properly so\r\ncalled--the hare does not exist: neither has any true hare been found in\r\nthe new world of Australia.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, hares are plenteous in the different continents of Europe,\r\nAsia, Africa, and America.  In Asia there is a species inhabiting the\r\nregions of the Altai Mountains, and another peculiar to the Siberian\r\nterritory, called the Tolai.  There is an Indian species found in the\r\nNepaul Mountains, and a curious variety, also a native of Nepaul and the\r\nHimalayas, known as the Woolly Hare of Thibet.\r\n\r\nThe Polar Hare, valued for its beautiful white fur, inhabits the\r\ncountries around the Arctic Ocean, and is common in Labrador and the\r\nHudson\'s Bay territory.  In North America, also, there are several other\r\nspecies of hares: the Marsh, or Swamp Hare, of the Southern United\r\nStates, which dwells among the extensive marshes of the Carolinas and\r\nLouisiana, and which freely takes to the water; the Rabbit of the Middle\r\nStates, which is a true hare, though from its small size usually termed\r\na rabbit; the Californian Hare, indigenous to California, and also\r\nanother Marsh Hare, belonging to the same country.  Upon the prairies\r\nseveral distinct species have lately been discovered, among which the\r\nSage Hare deserves especial mention.  This kind derives its name from\r\nits being a dweller on the desert plains, where scarce any other\r\nvegetation exists except the _artemisia_, or wild sage plant, the leaves\r\nof which constitute the principal food of the animal, rendering its\r\nflesh almost uneatable.\r\n\r\nThe _Calling Hares_ differ very much from the common hares and rabbits--\r\nso much as to constitute a separate genus.  Their ears are shorter, and\r\nthey are altogether without tails.  Their habits, however, are very\r\nsimilar to those of the hare family, and they are therefore very\r\nnaturally grouped with the latter.  They derive their trivial name from\r\nthe habit of uttering a note, which somewhat resembles the piping of a\r\nquail, and which can be heard at a very great distance.  This note is\r\nrepeated three or four times at night and morning, but is seldom heard\r\nduring the middle of the day, unless when the weather is cloudy.\r\n\r\nThe calling hares are distributed over Asia and North America.  At least\r\ntwo species belong to the Himalayan country, and one is found in Cabul.\r\nIn Siberia and Northern Russia there is another, called the Eadajac; and\r\nseveral species inhabit the northern countries of America--some so small\r\nas scarcely to exceed the dimensions of a rat!  The Little Chief is one\r\nof these tiny creatures long known; but late explorers of the Rocky\r\nMountain regions have discovered a species still smaller than the little\r\nchief.\r\n\r\nThe _Cavies_ appear to represent the hare family in the tropical parts\r\nof America.  It is true that these last differ from hares in many\r\nparticulars; but they have also many points of resemblance, and they may\r\nbe grouped together in a very natural manner.  They live much in the\r\nsame manner; they are swift and inoffensive as the hares; but, instead\r\nof being clothed in soft wool, which would be altogether unsuitable to\r\nthe climate in which they dwell, the cavies have a covering of hair so\r\nfine and thin as to convey to the touch a feeling of coolness rather\r\nthan warmth.  Some of the cavies are among the largest animals of the\r\nRodent Family; for instance, the great Capivara, which is equal in size\r\nto an ordinary pig.  This species is not a swift runner upon land; but\r\nit is semi-aquatic in its habits, and can swim and dive like an otter,\r\nits feet being webbed or palmated.  It herds in troops of from five or\r\nten to fifty in number, and is found upon the banks of all the great\r\nSouth American rivers, where it has for its chief enemy the fierce\r\njaguar.\r\n\r\nThe Guinea Pig is one of the family of cavies.  This beautiful little\r\nanimal is too well-known to require description.  It may be remarked,\r\nhowever, that the name Guinea Pig is altogether a mistake, since the\r\ncreature is found wild only in South America, and is _not_ a native of\r\nGuinea in Africa.  Very likely it was originally brought from Guiana,\r\nand this has led to the misnomer.  There are several species of Guinea\r\npig in South America, differing from one another in size, shape, and\r\ncolour.  Besides the large Capivara and the little Guinea Pig, there are\r\nseveral intermediate kinds.  These are known as the True Cavies, and are\r\nusually called Agoutis, or Acouchis.  The agoutis are about the size of\r\nthe common hare, and run almost as swiftly.  For their food they prefer\r\nnuts to herbage, which is natural enough in a region where the latter is\r\nscanty and the former exists in plenty; and in eating they "squat"\r\nupright on their haunches, and convey the food to their mouth after the\r\nmanner of squirrels.  The agouti, like the hare, frequently rolls over\r\nwhen descending a hill at full speed--a habit, or rather an accident,\r\ndue to the same cause in both animals, namely, the great length of the\r\nhind legs.  When angry, the agouti stamps with the fore-feet, grunts\r\nlike a young pig, and erects the bristly hair upon its crupper after the\r\nmanner of porcupines.\r\n\r\nThere are many species of agouti throughout tropical America and the\r\nWest India Islands, and the range of the genus extends as far south as\r\nthe plains of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe _Pacas_ form another genus belonging to the family of the cavies\r\nthat may be also grouped with the hares and rabbits.  They burrow like\r\nthe common rabbit, and their food consists of nuts, fruits, and roots.\r\nTheir flesh is excellent; and on this account they are hunted eagerly,\r\nboth by the Indians and whites who dwell in the countries where they are\r\nfound.  There are several species of them in South America, and they\r\nwere also very common at one time in the West India Islands; but on\r\naccount of the persecution of many enemies--more especially of hunters--\r\nthey are now comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nWith the hares and rabbits may be classed still another family of South\r\nAmerican animals, and one of the most interesting of the whole group.\r\nThese are the Chinchillas and Viscachas.  The place assigned to them by\r\nsome naturalists is with the hamsters, and therefore they are grouped\r\nwith the rats; but an examination into the habits of these animals shows\r\nthat they are in reality representatives of the hares and rabbits on the\r\nelevated table-lands of Chili and Peru, as also over the whole plain\r\ncountry of La Plata and Patagonia.  There are several species known\r\nindifferently as Viscachas and Chinchillas; but the true Chinchilla,\r\ncelebrated for its soft and beautiful woolly coat, is an inhabitant of\r\nthe elevated plateaux of the Andes, where the climate is as cold as in\r\nSiberia itself.  The natural history of these rodents is full of curious\r\ninterest, and deserves to be given more in detail, if our space would\r\nonly admit of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nELEPHANTS.\r\n\r\nThe Elephant is by far the largest of land animals, and for this reason\r\none of the most interesting to the student of zoology; but even without\r\nthis superiority, he possesses qualities that entitle him to rank among\r\nthe curious objects of creation.\r\n\r\nIn ages long gone by there were elephants upon the earth--or animals\r\nresembling elephants--as much larger than the existing species as these\r\nare superior in size to other quadrupeds.  Such were the mammoths and\r\nmastodons, the skeletons of which are occasionally found buried beneath\r\nthe surface of the soil in different parts of the world.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the species of this gigantic quadruped are not\r\nnumerous.  For a long time there was supposed to be only one; but this\r\nwas an erroneous belief, and it is now proved that there are _at least_\r\ntwo, since the elephants of Africa and those of Asia are altogether\r\ndifferent from each other.  It is not quite certain that the elephant of\r\nthe Island of Ceylon is identically the same as other Indian elephants;\r\nand in the Asiatic countries and islands there are varieties differing\r\nfrom each other in size, and other peculiarities, quite as much as any\r\nof them does from the elephant of Africa.  Again, in Africa itself we\r\nfind that this great creature has its varieties--some larger and some\r\nsmaller, according to the part of the country in which they are found.\r\nEven the natives of both Africa and the Indian territories recognise\r\ndifferent kinds, proving that on both continents there are several\r\npermanent varieties, if not species.\r\n\r\nIn the Indian countries these varieties have received distinct names--\r\njust as our breeds of dogs--and an elephant is valued according to the\r\nbreed or caste to which he belongs; for in India caste is a universal\r\nidea, even among animals.\r\n\r\nThere are two principal castes--the Koomareah, of princely race; and the\r\nMerghee, or hunting elephant.  These two kinds differ a good deal--as\r\nmuch, indeed, as if they were separate species.  The koomareah is\r\ndeep-bodied, strong, and compact, with a very large trunk and short\r\nthick legs.  As a large trunk is considered the great beauty of an\r\nelephant, the koomareah is therefore preferred to the merghee; besides,\r\nhe is also superior to the latter in strength and powers of endurance.\r\n\r\nThe merghee is a taller animal, but neither so compact nor so strong,\r\nand his trunk is short and slender in proportion to his height.  He\r\ntravels faster, however; and for this reason is oftener employed in the\r\nchase.\r\n\r\nA cross between these two varieties is called a Sunkareah, which\r\nsignifies a mixed breed or mule; and in a herd of elephants there will\r\nbe found not only sunkareahs, but several varieties of cross breeds\r\nbetween the koomareahs and merghees.  These "mules" are prized if they\r\npartake more of the nature of the princely caste, and less valued when\r\nnearer to the merghee.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these distinctions, another very important one is found\r\nin the size and shape of the teeth.  The Dauntelah is one with very\r\nlarge teeth, in opposition to the Mookna, in which the tusks are of\r\nsmall dimensions, and scarcely visible outside the mouth.  The Europeans\r\nprefer elephants of the mookna variety, as these are of milder\r\ndisposition than the dauntelahs; but the natives prize the large-toothed\r\nkinds, taking the chance of being able to tame them to submission.\r\nThere are many degrees between the mookna and dauntelah, founded on the\r\nform of the tusks.  Those of the Pullung-daunt project forward with an\r\nalmost horizontal curve, while the straight tusks of the mooknas point\r\ndirectly downwards.  Nearly a dozen varieties or breeds are thus\r\nestablished among the elephants of India that are held in a state of\r\ndomestication.\r\n\r\nWhite elephants are also met with, and are highly prized by the rajahs\r\nand wealthy nobles.  These are mere varieties, produced by albinism, and\r\nmay belong to any of the castes already described.\r\n\r\nIt has been further ascertained that the elephants of different Indian\r\ncountries vary a good deal in point of size.  Those from the southern\r\ndistricts, and some of the larger islands, are larger and stronger than\r\nthe elephants of Nepaul and other mountain countries in the north.  The\r\nfinest are those of Cochin China and the Burmese territories of Pegu,\r\nwhile those of Ceylon are even superior to the kinds indigenous to\r\nNorthern India.\r\n\r\nThe African elephants are said also to be larger as they dwell nearer to\r\nthe Equator; and from this it would appear that the elephant is\r\nessentially a tropical animal, and thrives best in the climate of the\r\ntorrid zone.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic elephant is found wild as well as domesticated in nearly all\r\nthe Indian countries, as also in many of the large islands.  Its range\r\nnorthward is bounded by the lower hills of the Himalayas; and among\r\nthese, especially through the _saul_ forests, these huge animals roam\r\nabout in herds, each herd being under the guidance or leadership of an\r\nold male, or "bull," as he is termed.  As an elephant brings a\r\nconsiderable sum of money, even in India, these are eagerly hunted; and\r\ntheir capture is accomplished by decoying them into a pound or enclosure\r\nconstructed for the purpose, where ropes are attached to them, and then\r\ntied to the neighbouring trees.  The decoy used is a tame elephant, that\r\nhas been already trained for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThere are in India, as well as in Africa, certain old bull elephants\r\nthat lead a solitary life, and that are scarcely ever seen in company\r\nwith the herds.  These bachelors are usually of a morose and fierce\r\ndisposition, and when one of them is captured it requires all the skill\r\nof the hunters to keep clear of danger.  These wild bulls are larger and\r\nstronger than the common kind, and so untamable in their ferocity that\r\neven when captured no use can be made of them, since they will die\r\nrather than submit to being trained.  They are called Goondahs by the\r\npeople of Hindostau, and by English hunters Rogues or Rovers.\r\n\r\nThe African elephant next merits attention.  There is no difficulty in\r\ndistinguishing this species from any of the Indian varieties.  The\r\nimmensely large ears constitute a marked characteristic of the former,\r\nwhich at once becomes recognisable.  Other points of difference are the\r\ngreater convexity of the forehead or skull and the larger size of the\r\ntusks; though this last point of distinction is not always to be\r\ndepended upon, since there are Indian elephants with tusks of similar\r\ndimensions.  Generally, however, the African elephants have the largest\r\n"ivories."\r\n\r\nIn point of bulk the Asiatic species has been considered superior; but\r\nthis belief may not be correct.  Certain circumstances should be taken\r\ninto account.  The Asiatic elephant is living in a domesticated state,\r\nand this may have produced a greater size, as it does in the case of\r\nmost other quadrupeds.  Another circumstance: the African elephants of\r\nour collections have been mostly obtained from the Cape, or the regions\r\ncontiguous to it.  But it is now known that in the countries nearer to\r\nthe equator there exists a much larger kind, that appears to be quite as\r\nbulky as any of the Asiatic varieties.\r\n\r\nThe height of the elephant has been much exaggerated by travellers--some\r\nhaving been described as measuring eighteen feet from the foot to the\r\ntop of the shoulder!  An authority on this subject, who measured the\r\nlargest he could meet with in different parts of India, found none that\r\nstood over twelve feet, and this appears to be the actual height of the\r\nvery biggest of elephants.\r\n\r\nThe African elephants have not been tamed--at least not in modern times;\r\nbut it is certain that the elephants used by the Carthaginians in their\r\nwars with the Romans were of this species; and also that African\r\nelephants were the species exhibited by Caesar and Pompey in the Roman\r\narena.\r\n\r\nIn a wild state the African elephant has a wide range--from the Cape\r\ncountry on the south to Senegal on the western side, throughout the\r\nwhole of Central Africa, and along the oriental coast to the valley of\r\nthe Nile; but it is not very certain whether the elephant of the eastern\r\ncountries of Africa is the African species or a variety of the Asiatic\r\nkind.  The African elephant is said to be fiercer than that of Asia; but\r\nthis is a doubtful statement; and perhaps the habits of the two do not\r\nmaterially differ, farther than might be expected from a difference of\r\nclimate, food, and other external circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE HIPPOPOTAMUS, RHINOCEROS, AND TAPIR.\r\n\r\nThough these three kinds of creatures belong to different genera, there\r\nis a certain family likeness among them that entitles them to be classed\r\ntogether; and since there are not many species of each, they will\r\nconveniently form a group.\r\n\r\nOf late the hippopotamus has been the most notorious of the three;\r\nthough he is far from being as interesting an animal as the rhinoceros.\r\nSince, however, he is at present the most popular, we shall give him the\r\nforemost place in our sketch.\r\n\r\nThe Hippopotamus was known to the Greeks and Romans.  His name is Greek,\r\nand, as every one knows, signifies the River-horse.  Why so called? you\r\nmay ask--since between this unwieldy creature and the beautiful horse\r\nthere does not appear a single point of resemblance.  The answer is,\r\nthat the cry of the hippopotamus was fancied to resemble the neighing of\r\na horse; and in some respects this is really the case.  Hence the\r\nmisnomer.  The Dutch of the Cape Colony call the creature a Cow, or\r\nSea-cow, which is also an ill-adapted name.  The cow is well enough, for\r\nthe head and mouth of the animal bear a very striking resemblance to\r\nthose of a broad-muffled cow; but what the "sea" has to do with it is\r\nnot so clearly understood: since the hippopotamus is found only in fresh\r\nwater in lakes and rivers.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that this huge creature is of amphibious habits; and\r\nlives equally well on land, in the water, or even under the water.  It\r\nrequires air, however, and at intervals rises to the surface to breathe.\r\nOn such occasions it usually projects a jet of water from its\r\nnostrils--in other words, it spouts, after the manner of the whales.\r\n\r\nIt is altogether herbivorous; and grass and the leaves of succulent\r\nplants form its subsistence.  A vast quantity of these are required to\r\nsustain it; and a single individual will consume as much as two hundred\r\npounds\' weight in a day.\r\n\r\nThe hippopotamus, notwithstanding its formidable appearance, is not a\r\ndangerous enemy if suffered to go unmolested, or rather if persons do\r\nnot come in its way.  When wounded, however, or even intruded upon in\r\nits solitary haunts, it will attack man himself; and a boat or canoe\r\npassing along a river frequented by these creatures is in danger of\r\nsuffering a similar fate to that resulting from an encounter with the\r\ngreat whale--that is, of being tossed out of the water or broken to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nThe River-horse, or Sea-cow (whichever you prefer to call the creature),\r\nis exclusively confined to the African continent; and is found in all\r\nthe great lakes and rivers from the Cape Colony to the southern limits\r\nof the Sahara.  It is indigenous to the Upper Nile; but does not show\r\nitself in the lower half of that river.  In fact, its range appears to\r\nbe exactly co-terminal with that of the African elephant.\r\n\r\nThere is a question about the number of species.  For long it was\r\nsupposed there was only one, but now it is ascertained that two, or even\r\nmore, exist.  The hippopotami of the Nile differ considerably from each\r\nother and also from the species known as Sea-cow in South Africa; while\r\na smaller kind than either has been observed in the rivers of Western\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe _Rhinoceros_ is altogether a more curious and interesting animal\r\nthan the hippopotamus; but, being more common, and oftener encountered\r\nby modern travellers, it is at present less an object of curiosity.\r\n\r\nOf rhinoceroses at least seven distinct species are known--three of them\r\nbeing Asiatic, and four African.\r\n\r\nThe largest of all is the Indian rhinoceros, which inhabits a part of\r\nBengal and the countries beyond--Burmah, Siam, and Cochin China.  This\r\nspecies is easily distinguished from the others by the thick rough skin,\r\nwhich is placed on the animal\'s body in such a fashion as to resemble a\r\ncoat of ancient armour.  The singular protuberances have a complete\r\nresemblance to the "bosses" which were worn on the shields and\r\nbreast-plates of warriors of the olden time.\r\n\r\nA second species, the Warak, which inhabits Java, is somewhat similarly\r\naccoutred; but the third Asiatic kind, the Sumatran rhinoceros, has a\r\nsmoother skin, more resembling that of the African rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nThese last-mentioned are denizens of the African continent; but\r\nespecially of the regions extending northward from the Cape.  They do\r\nnot all four frequent the same district; but two, and sometimes three of\r\nthem, are found in one locality.  They are distinguished as the black\r\nand white rhinoceroses--there being two species of the black, and two of\r\nthe white.  The black ones are much fiercer than their white congeners;\r\nalthough the latter are by far the largest, and present a far more\r\nformidable appearance, from the extreme length of their horns.\r\n\r\nThe _Tapir_ was for a long time supposed to be exclusively an American\r\nanimal, but later research proves that there is also a species in Asia.\r\nIt is found in the Island of Sumatra, and is larger than the American\r\nspecies, though very much resembling it in other respects.  A new\r\nspecies has also been discovered in South America, altogether differing\r\nfrom the American tapir already so well-known.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the American tapir are not unlike those of the rhinoceros.\r\nIt is a creature of great strength, and heavy in its movements.  It can\r\nlive for a long time under water; and its haunts are the banks of the\r\ngreat rivers--especially where these are marshy, and covered with reeds\r\nand other aquatic plants, which constitute its food.  It can swim or\r\nwalk under the water at will; but its lair is generally in some bushy\r\nretreat at a distance from the banks; and its visits to the water are\r\nusually nocturnal.  It is an object of chase among the native Indians,\r\nwho prize both its flesh and skin; but its capture is by no means an\r\neasy matter, since its thick hide renders it impervious to the tiny\r\narrow of the blow-gun.\r\n\r\nThis species is found in all the rivers of South America, from Paraguay\r\nto the Isthmus of Darien; but its range terminates very abruptly on the\r\nnorth--a fact which puzzles the naturalist, since for many degrees\r\nfurther northward, climate and other circumstances are found similar to\r\nthose which appear to favour its existence in the southern part of the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe other species of American tapir differs considerably in the nature\r\nof its haunts and habits.  In these it is said more to resemble the\r\ntapir of Sumatra.  The latter is found dwelling at a great elevation, in\r\nfact, on the tops of the highest mountains of that island; whereas the\r\nDanta, or American tapir, is altogether confined to the low hot plains.\r\nIn the same district of country, and even in the same rivers--but\r\nfurther up among the mountains--the smaller species of American tapir is\r\nmet with, but never upon the low level of the plains.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that for more than three centuries, in a country\r\ninhabited by a civilised people, this new species of American tapir has\r\nremained not only undescribed but even unknown to the scientific world,\r\nwe may fairly conjecture that other species of this, as well as of many\r\nother animals, may yet be brought to light to gratify the lover of\r\nnature, and add to his store of pleasant knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nGIRAFFES, CAMELS, AND LLAMAS.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the Giraffes cannot be considered as belonging to the\r\nsame family with the Camels, nor yet the Camels be classed with the\r\nLlamas; but there is a very great resemblance between these three genera\r\nof animals, and, except for scientific purposes, they form a group\r\nsufficiently natural.  Indeed any one of the three is more like to the\r\nother two than to any other kind of mammalia; although some naturalists\r\nprefer considering the giraffe as a species of deer.  This\r\nclassification, however, rests principally upon an erroneous\r\nsupposition--that the oblong protuberances on the head of the giraffe\r\nare horns, which in reality they are not, but mere continuations of the\r\nfrontal bone.  It would be as absurd, therefore, to call the giraffe a\r\ndeer, as to consider it a species of camel, and perhaps more so.  It may\r\nbe regarded as an animal _sui generis_; but in making a series of\r\ngroups--such as we have here attempted--it appears more natural to place\r\nit alongside the camels than elsewhere; and it is certainly as much like\r\nthe true camel or dromedary as either the llama or vicuna.  One of its\r\nmost popular names--that of Camelopard, or Spotted Camel--shows the\r\nresemblance which suggests itself to the eye of the traveller and\r\nordinary observer; and this resemblance extends also to many characters\r\nthat are not external.  Indeed, after all that has been said by\r\nanatomical naturalists, we might hazard assertion of the belief, that\r\nthe camelopard is neither more nor less than a species of wild camel.\r\n\r\nIts appearance need not be described.  Every eye is familiar with the\r\nslender form, long neck, smooth coat, and spotted skin of this singular\r\nanimal.  But its habits are less understood, and this arises from\r\nseveral distinct causes.  In the first place, the giraffe inhabits only\r\nthose countries about which very little is known by civilised people;\r\nsecondly, it is but rarely seen, even by travellers; and, thirdly, when\r\nit _is_ encountered in its native haunts, it is of so shy a disposition,\r\nand so ready to take flight, that scarce any opportunity is ever\r\nobtained for properly observing it.\r\n\r\nThe giraffe is exclusively confined to the continent of Africa; but its\r\nrange is by no means limited.  It was formerly common enough as far\r\nsouth as the Cape itself, whence it was driven by the Dutch and\r\nHottentot hunters.  It is not now met with to the south of the Great\r\nOrange River.  Northward from this point, it extends to Nubia and\r\nAbyssinia; but it does not appear that it inhabits the western section\r\nof the continent, since it is not heard of in Guinea, or any of the\r\ncountries on the Atlantic coast.  In the interior it is common enough.\r\n\r\nThe giraffes herd together in small troops--consisting of ten or a dozen\r\nindividuals--and prefer the open forests, or rather the hills covered\r\nwith copses of acacia and other African trees.  Their principal food is\r\nthe foliage of these trees; and one species of mimosa--the _camel-doorn_\r\n(camel-thorn) of the Dutch hunters--is their especial favourite.  The\r\nleaves of this tree, like all others of the acacia tribe, are of pinnate\r\nform, and sweet to the taste; and the giraffe browses upon them,\r\nstanding erect, with its long neck outstretched to a height of nearly\r\ntwenty feet!  Its tongue is possessed of a peculiarly prehensile power,\r\nand with this extended a foot or more beyond the lips, it can sweep in\r\nthe leaves and twigs for a wide circle around its muzzle.\r\n\r\nWhen affrighted and put to its speed, the giraffe appears to go with an\r\nup-and-down gait, and some travellers have alleged that it limps.  This\r\narises from the fact, that every time it lifts its fore-feet, it throws\r\nback its long neck, which on other occasions is always held erect.  It\r\nsometimes travels with a pacing step, but it can also gallop after the\r\nmanner of a horse, and is even so swift that it requires a horse at full\r\nspeed to overtake it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that its food consists principally of the leaves and\r\ntwigs of trees, the giraffe will also eat grass.  While browsing thus,\r\nit usually bends one of its knees downward; and while stretching upwards\r\nto a high branch, it brings all its feet nearer to each other.  It often\r\nlies down to "chew its cud" or to sleep; and this habit produces the\r\ncallosities upon the sternum and knees, which resemble those of the\r\ncamels.\r\n\r\nThe giraffe is a peaceful and timid animal, and is often the prey of the\r\nlion--the fierce beast of prey taking it unawares, springing upon its\r\nback, and destroying it by breaking the cervical vertebrae with his\r\npowerful teeth.  Sometimes, however, it is enabled to drive the lion off\r\nby kicking out against him with its heels, and tiring or discouraging\r\nhim from the attack.\r\n\r\nThe Hottentots and Kaffirs hunt the giraffe for the sake of its flesh,\r\nwhich in young individuals is very good eating.  Sometimes, however, it\r\nsmells strongly of a species of shrub upon which the animal feeds, and\r\nwhich gives it a disagreeable odour.  The Bushmen are particularly fond\r\nof the marrow produced in its long shank bones, and to obtain this, they\r\nhunt the animal with their poisoned arrows.  They also make out of its\r\nskin bottles and other vessels for containing water.\r\n\r\nConspicuous as is the giraffe, it is not so easy to distinguish it in\r\nthe haunts where it inhabits.  Seen from a distance, it has the\r\nappearance of a decayed tree, and, remaining motionless, it is often\r\npassed by the hunter or traveller without being observed.  It is itself\r\nvery keen-sighted; and the manner in which its large beautiful eye is\r\nset gives it a decided advantage for seeing around it, even without the\r\nnecessity of turning its head.  On this account it is approached with\r\ngreat difficulty, and usually contrives to escape from the most ardent\r\npursuer.\r\n\r\nThe _Camels_ come next in turn.  Of these there exist two distinct\r\nspecies--the Camel, or Bactrian camel; and the Dromedary, or Arabian\r\ncamel.  Both are found only in a domesticated state.  Both are "beasts\r\nof burthen," and of both there are several varieties.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, of the Bactrian camel--that is, the species with two humps.\r\n\r\nThis animal differs very much from the Arabian camel, and is altogether\r\nmore rare.  It is about ten feet in length of body, and covered\r\ngenerally with a thick shaggy coat of hair of a dark brown colour; but\r\nthere is no difficulty in distinguishing it from its Arabian congener.\r\nThe two huge humps or hunches upon its back form a sufficient token by\r\nwhich to identify the species.\r\n\r\nIt is found in Persia and the adjoining countries; but in no part in\r\nsuch numbers as in the middle zone of Asia--in the Taurus, and to the\r\nnorth of the Himalaya Mountains.  It is also seen occasionally in Arabia\r\nand other countries; but in these it is rare, the dromedary taking its\r\nplace for all purposes required by man.  It is, nevertheless, of a\r\nstouter build than the latter, and stronger in proportion to its size.\r\nAs already stated, there are several varieties, produced by a difference\r\nin stature, colour, and swiftness.\r\n\r\nThe Dromedary, or Arabian camel, is altogether more widely distributed,\r\nand better known to the world.  It is propagated in Arabia, Persia, the\r\nsouth of Tartary, some parts of India, in Africa from Egypt to Morocco,\r\nand from the Mediterranean Sea to the river Senegal.  It is also\r\nnumerous in the Canary Islands, and has been introduced into Italy,\r\nespecially at Pisa, in Tuscany.  It is not generally known that it has\r\nalso been transported into the Island of Cuba, and employed at the mines\r\nof El Cobre, near Santiago; and later still--in fact, at the present\r\nhour--an attempt is being made to naturalise it upon the central plains\r\nof Texas and California.\r\n\r\nThe callosities upon the limbs and chest, and the hump on the back, have\r\ncaused much perplexity among naturalists; but, perhaps, their purpose\r\nmay be explained.  They seem to bear some relation to the necessities of\r\nthe animal, considered as the slave or man.  The callosities are the\r\npoints on which it kneels down to receive its burden.  The hump, which\r\nis a fatty secretion, is known to be absorbed into the system when the\r\nanimal is pinched for food, thus forming a provision against the\r\ncasualties to which it is subject in a life evidently ordained to be\r\npassed in the desert.  Add to this, that its singularly formed stomach\r\nrenders it capable of containing a supply of water suitable to long\r\njourneys, and we have ample evidence of the purpose for which this\r\nsingular and useful creature was designed.\r\n\r\nThe camel furnishes the Arab with flesh and milk, of its hair he weaves\r\nclothing, and even tents; his belt and sandals are the produce of its\r\nhide, and its dung affords him fuel.\r\n\r\nThe hair of the Persian camel is held in the highest estimation.  There\r\nare three kinds of it--black, red, and grey; the black being of most\r\nvalue, and the grey fetching only half the price of the red.\r\n\r\nBut all such uses are mere trifles when compared with the value of these\r\nanimals as beasts of burden--"ships of the desert," as they have been\r\npoetically named.  By means of them, communication is kept up between\r\ndistant countries separated by large tracts of frightful deserts, which,\r\nwithout some such aid, would be entirely impassable by man.\r\n\r\nWe arrive at the _Llamas_, or camel sheep, as the old Spanish colonists\r\nused to call them.\r\n\r\nThese animals are natives of South America, and their range is limited.\r\nThey are found only on the high plateaus of the Andes; through which\r\nthey extend, from New Granada on the north to Chili on the south, though\r\none species ranges even to the Straits of Magellan.  In all there are\r\nfour distinct species of them--the Llama proper, the Paca or Alpaca, the\r\nGuanaco, and the Vicuna.\r\n\r\nThe Llama and Paca are both held in a state of domestication; the former\r\nas a beast of burden, and the latter for its hair or wool.  On the other\r\nhand, the Guanacos and Vicunas are wild animals, and are eagerly hunted\r\nby the mountain tribes of Indians for their flesh and skins, but in the\r\ncase of the vicuna for the very fine wool which it yields, and which\r\ncommands an enormous price in the markets of Peru.\r\n\r\nThe Cordilleras of the Andes, below the line of perpetual snow, is the\r\nregion inhabited by these creatures.  In the hot countries, lying lower,\r\nthey do not thrive; and even die in journeys made to the tropic coast\r\nlands.  The wild species keep together in herds--sometimes of one or two\r\nhundred individuals--feeding on a sort of rushy grass or reed--called\r\n_yea_ by the natives--and they scarce ever drink, so long as they can\r\npasture on green herbage.  They have the singular habit of going to a\r\nparticular spot to drop their dung, which resembles that of goats or\r\nsheep; and this habit often costs them their lives, since the excrement\r\npoints out to the hunter their place of resort.  They keep a careful\r\nlook-out against any danger, usually taking care to place old males as\r\nsentinels of the flock, who give warning of the approach of an enemy.\r\nWhen startled they run swiftly, but soon halt, stand gazing back, and\r\nthen gallop on as before.\r\n\r\nDuring summer they frequent the sides of the mountains; but, as winter\r\napproaches, they descend to the high table plains, and browse upon the\r\nnatural meadows found there.  They are captured in various ways.  The\r\nIndians take them by first surrounding the herd, and then driving it\r\nwithin enclosures constructed for the purpose.  They are also run down\r\nby dogs, trained to hunt them by the mountaineers of Chili, in which\r\ncountry they are found wild in great numbers.  During the chase they\r\nfrequently turn upon their pursuer, utter a wild shrill neighing, and\r\nthen resume their rapid flight.\r\n\r\nThe Vicunas--which are the smallest of the four kinds, and also the\r\nprettiest--are captured by the Indians in a still more singular manner.\r\nA large tract of the plains is enclosed merely by a cord, stretched\r\nhorizontally upon stakes, of about four feet in height.  To the cord are\r\nattached pieces of cloth, feathers, or coloured rags of any kind.  Into\r\nthis feeble enclosure the herd of vicunas is driven; and, strange to\r\nsay, the frightened animals will permit themselves to be crowded\r\ntogether, and killed with stones rather than leap over the cord.\r\n\r\nWhen any guanacos chance to be mixed up with the herd, the result is\r\nlikely to be very different.  These, being of bolder spirit, as well as\r\nlarger size, at once overleap or break through the fictitious barrier,\r\nand sweep off to the mountains, followed by the whole flock of the\r\nvicunas.\r\n\r\nThe capability of the llama to carry burdens is well-known.  They were\r\nthus employed by the ancient Peruvians, and, although at present they\r\nare less valued on this account, many are still used in carrying the\r\nores from the rich gold and silver mines of Chili and Peru to the\r\nsmelting furnaces, or ports of embarkation on the coast.  The\r\nintroduction of the mule, however, has to a great extent relieved the\r\nllamas of their load; and less attention is now paid either to their\r\ntraining or increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nSWINE.\r\n\r\nIf not one of the most agreeable, the Hog--or Pig, as it is oftener\r\ncalled--is one of the most useful of the domesticated animals.  Indeed,\r\nit would be difficult to say how culinary operations could be carried on\r\nwithout the valuable fat which this creature produces in such plenty,\r\nand to which both cooks and confectioners are so largely indebted.\r\nBesides, there are whole nations who feed almost entirely upon its\r\nflesh; and even its skin and bristles constitute an important item of\r\nmanufacturing industry.  The facility with which the flesh can be\r\npreserved under the name of bacon, the length of time it may be kept\r\nwithout the danger of spoiling, combined with the undoubted\r\nwholesomeness of such an article of diet, render it one of the most\r\nconvenient articles of provision; and hence in agricultural districts,\r\nand other places far remote from towns, it is an almost universal\r\narticle of food.\r\n\r\nThe number of species that form the group of hogs or swine is very\r\nlimited indeed; in all not exceeding half a score.  These, however, are\r\nfound in endless varieties, and distributed over all the globe, since in\r\neach of the five great divisions one or more indigenous kind of hog has\r\nbeen found.  That which forms the type on which the swine family is\r\nfounded, is, of course, the _Common Pig_; and this is supposed to be\r\ndescended from the wild boar, so well-known in connection with the chase\r\nduring medieval times.\r\n\r\nIt is superfluous to say that the common hog of our farmyards has been\r\npropagated until an almost countless variety of breeds have been\r\nproduced--not only every country, but even single counties or provinces\r\nhaving a breed of its own.  All, however, are so much alike in habits\r\nand general appearance, and their characteristics so well-known, that it\r\nwould be idle to give any description of them here.  We shall only\r\nremark that the pig, if fairly treated, is by no means an animal of\r\nfilthy or dirty habits, as is generally supposed.  On the contrary, it\r\nis cleanly in its nature; and its slovenliness is brought upon it by the\r\nmanner in which it is styed up, in its own filth.  Neither is it a\r\nstupid creature, but possesses considerable intelligence; as is proved\r\nby the tricks which it has been taught to perform under the name of the\r\n"learned pig;" while several individuals have been trained to follow the\r\ngun, and stand to game as stanch as the best pointers.  In France it is\r\nnot uncommon for the truffle-hunters to use pigs in search of this\r\nfavourite esculent--the keenness of scent which the animal possesses\r\nenabling it to find this hidden treasure, just as it does potatoes or\r\nother roots, far under the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe _Wild Boar_, next to the common domestic variety, is the best known\r\nand most celebrated of the swine.  In earlier times it was found in\r\nevery part of Europe.  Even at this day, it is not rare in the forest\r\nfastnesses of most of the continental countries, and also in Asia.  It\r\nwas formerly common in England, and the chase of it was a favourite\r\npastime among the kings and nobles, especially about the time of the\r\nNorman Conquest.  In those days the Game laws were certainly harsh\r\nenough--much more so than those of our own time--since William the\r\nConqueror issued an edict punishing with the _loss of his eyes_ any one\r\nwho should be convicted of killing a wild boar!\r\n\r\nIn Europe the famed boar spear, used in hunting this animal, has given\r\nway to the rifle; but in India, where the field is taken on horseback,\r\nthe spear is still in use; and hunting the wild boar is one of the most\r\nexciting of wild sports practised in that country.\r\n\r\nThe wild boar of India, however, is in some respects different from that\r\nof Europe; and naturalists generally class it as a distinct species.\r\n\r\nThe _Babirussa_ is another species belonging to the East Indian world:\r\nfound principally in the Moluccas and other islands of the Indian\r\nArchipelago.  It is of about the same size as the common pig; but of\r\nmore slender shape, and stands higher upon its deer-like limbs.  The\r\nskin is thinly furnished with soft bristles, and is of a greyish tint,\r\ninclining to fawn colour on the belly.  But the most striking character\r\nof the babirussa is to be found in its tusks.  Of these there are two\r\npairs of unequal size.  The lower ones are short--somewhat resembling\r\nthose of the common boar--whereas the two upper ones protrude through\r\nthe skin of the muzzle, and then curve backward like a pair of horns,\r\nand often downward again, so as to form a complete circle!  It is not\r\nknown for what purpose these appendages exist.  The two lower tusks must\r\nbe formidable weapons; but the upper ones, especially in old\r\nindividuals, can hardly inflict a wound.  They may perhaps ward off the\r\nbushes from the eyes of the animal, as it rushes through the thick cover\r\nof its jungly retreat.  The females are without these tusks; and are\r\nalso much smaller than the males.\r\n\r\nThe babirussa inhabits marshy thickets and forests; and is hunted for\r\nits flesh--which is highly prized both by the natives and foreigners.\r\nIt is very swift and fierce.  When pursued or wounded in the chase, it\r\nwill show fight like the wild boar of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe _Papuan hog_, or _bene_, is a native of the Island of New Guinea;\r\nand is characterised by its small stature and slender and graceful form.\r\nIts tusks are not large, and are shaped like the incisor teeth.  It is\r\ncovered with thick, short, and yellowish-coloured bristles; and when\r\nyoung it is marked by bright fulvous stripes along the back.  The native\r\nPapuans highly esteem its flesh; and on this account it is hunted by\r\nthem in the forests where it is found.  Its young are often captured,\r\nand brought up in a domesticated state--in order that their flesh may\r\nthe more easily be procured.  Foreigners, who have visited this island,\r\nrelish it as an article of food.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the hogs of Africa--the Wart-hogs, as they are commonly\r\ncalled.  Of these there are two species; and it would be difficult to\r\nsay which is the uglier of the two.  In respect of _ugliness_, either\r\nwill compare advantageously with any other animal in creation.  The\r\ndeformity lies principally in the _countenance_ of these animals; and is\r\ncaused by two pairs of large protuberances, or warts, that rise upon the\r\ncheeks and over the frontal bone.  These excrescences--if we may so call\r\nthem--lend to the visage of the creature an aspect positively hideous,\r\nwhich is rendered still more ugly and fierce-looking by a pair of\r\nformidable tusks curving upward from each jaw.  The body is nearly\r\nnaked--excepting along the neck and back, where a long bristly mane\r\ngives a shaggy appearance to the animal--especially when these bristles,\r\nof nearly a foot in length, are erected under the impulse of rage.\r\nOther peculiarities are, a pair of whiskers of white curling hair along\r\nthe lower jaws; small black eyes surrounded by white bristly hair; a\r\nlong tail tufted at the extremity; and on the knees of the fore-legs a\r\npiece of thick callous skin, hard and protuberant.  In fact, every\r\ncharacteristic of this creature seems intended to make his portrait as\r\ndisagreeable as may be.\r\n\r\nWe have said there are two species.  These are known as Aelian\'s\r\nwart-hog and the Cape wart-hog.  The former is a native of Abyssinia,\r\nKordofan, and other countries of North Africa; while the latter, as its\r\nname implies, is found at the Cape--or rather throughout the whole\r\nsouthern part of the continent.  It is the Vlack Vaark of the Dutch\r\ncolonists; and this species differs from Elian\'s wart-hog in having the\r\ncheek protuberances much larger, its head more singularly shaped, and,\r\nif possible, in being _uglier_!\r\n\r\nThe wart-hog dwells among low bushes and forests.  It creeps on its bent\r\nfore-feet in quest of food--sliding along on its knees, and propelling\r\nitself forward by its hind legs.  This habit will account for the\r\ncallosities already mentioned.  In this posture it digs up the ground,\r\nextracting therefrom the roots and bulbs (of which its food is supposed\r\nentirely to consist); for, fierce and hideous as its aspect may be, the\r\nwart-hog is less omnivorous than several other species of the tribe.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the indigenous hogs of America, the _Peccaries_.  Of these,\r\nalso, there are two species described by naturalists; though certainly a\r\nthird kind exists in the South American forests, distinct from the two\r\nthat are known.\r\n\r\nThese are the _Collared Peccary_, or _Coyametl_; and the _White-lipped\r\nPeccary_, or _Tagassou_.\r\n\r\nFor a long time these two species were confounded with each other; but\r\nit is now proved that they are distinct--not only in size and colour,\r\nbut to some extent also in their geographical distribution, their\r\nhaunts, and habits.\r\n\r\nThe Collared Peccary is of small stature: not larger than a half-grown\r\nBerkshire pig.  It is thickly covered with hairy bristles of a\r\ngreyish-brown colour, and has a whitish band or collar around the neck--\r\nfrom which circumstance it derives its trivial specific name.  Its\r\ngeographical range is more extensive than that of its congener.  It is\r\nfound not only in South America, but throughout the whole of Central and\r\nNorth America, as far as the borders of the United States territory: in\r\nother words, the limits of its range are co-extensive with what was\r\nformerly _Spanish America_.  It exists in Texas; and still further to\r\nthe north-west, in New Mexico and California--though nowhere to the east\r\nof the Mississippi river.  In Texas it is common enough; and stories are\r\nrelated of many a redoubtable Texan hunter having been "tree\'d"--that\r\nis, forced to take shelter in a tree from a band of peccaries, whose\r\nrage he may have provoked while wandering in their haunts, and too\r\nrecklessly making use of his rifle.  The same is related as occurring to\r\nSouth American hunters with the white-lipped peccaries--that have a\r\nsimilar habit of trooping together in droves, and acting in concert,\r\nboth for defence and attack, against the common enemy.\r\n\r\nThe chief points of distinction between the two species are in the size\r\nand colour.  The white-lipped kind is much the larger--frequently\r\nweighing one hundred pounds--while a full-grown individual of the\r\ncollared peccary does not exceed in weight over fifty pounds.  The\r\nformer are of a deeper brown colour, want the white collar around the\r\nneck; but in its stead have a whitish patch around the mouth or lips,\r\nfrom which also comes their specific appellation.  These are also\r\nthicker and stouter, have shorter legs, and a more expanded snout.  They\r\ntroop together in larger droves, that often number a thousand\r\nindividuals of all ages and sizes.  Thus united, they traverse extensive\r\ndistricts of forest--the whole drove occupying an extent of a league in\r\nlength--all directed in their march by an old male, who acts as leader.\r\nShould they be impeded in their progress by a river, the chief stops for\r\na moment to reconnoitre; then plunges boldly into the stream, followed\r\nby all the rest of the troop.  The breadth of the river, and the\r\nrapidity of the current, seem to be but trifling obstacles to them; and\r\nare overcome easily, since the peccaries are excellent swimmers.  They\r\ncontinue their onward march through the open grounds; over the\r\nplantations, which, unfortunately for their owners, may chance to lie in\r\ntheir way; and which they sometimes completely devastate, by rooting out\r\nthe whole of the crops of maize, potatoes, sugarcane, or manioc.  If\r\nthey should meet with any opposition, they make a singular noise--\r\nchattering their teeth like castanets; and if a hunter should chance to\r\nattack them when moving thus, he is sure to be surrounded and torn to\r\npieces: unless he find some tree or other convenient object, where he\r\nmay make escape, by getting out of their reach.\r\n\r\nThe white-lipped peccaries are found in all the forests of South\r\nAmerica--from the Caribbean Sea to the Pampas of Buenos Ayres.  They are\r\nabundant in Paraguay; and Sonnini, the traveller, has observed them in\r\nGuyana.  Others report their presence on the Orinoco and its\r\ntributaries--as also on all the waters of the Amazon.  Most probably, it\r\nwas from the number of these animals observed upon its banks by the\r\nearly travellers, that the last-mentioned river obtained one of its\r\nSpanish names--the Rio Maranon--which signifies the "river of the wild\r\nhogs."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nHORSES AND ASSES.\r\n\r\nThe Horse--_par excellence_ the noblest of animals--is represented by\r\nonly a limited number of species; but, like other creatures domesticated\r\nby man, he is found of many different breeds and varieties: too many to\r\nbe minutely described in these pages.  Suffice it to say, that almost\r\nevery civilised nation possesses several kinds of horses--differing from\r\none another in size, shape, colour, and qualities: in size especially--\r\nsince this fine animal may be observed not much bigger than a mastiff;\r\nwhile other members of his family attain almost to the dimensions of an\r\nelephant!  Even savage tribes, both in Asia and America, are in\r\npossession of peculiar breeds of horses; and it may be assumed as a\r\nfact, that more than a hundred varieties exist upon the earth.  These\r\nhave all been regarded as springing from one original stock; but here\r\nagain there is only vague conjecture; and it is far more probable, that\r\nthe domesticated horses are the descendants of several kinds originally\r\ndistinct in their wild state.\r\n\r\nThere are wild horses at the present day in Asia, Africa, and America;\r\nbut it is questionable whether any of these are the descendants of an\r\noriginally wild stock.  More likely they are the progeny of horses\r\nescaped from the domesticated breeds.  Of course we refer to the _true_\r\nhorses of the genus _equus_; and not to the dziggetais, quaggas, and\r\nzebras--to which we shall presently refer.  These last-mentioned kinds\r\nare still found wild, as they have ever been; and, with one or two\r\nexceptions, none of their species have been tamed to the use of man.\r\n\r\nIn America--both in the northern and southern divisions of the\r\ncontinent--herds of wild horses are numerous.  These have all sprung\r\nfrom individuals that escaped from their owners, and in process of time\r\nhave multiplied to a great extent.  Of course they could have no other\r\norigin: since it is well-known that, previous to the time of Columbus,\r\nno animal of the horse kind existed in America.  The wild horses now\r\nfound there are descended then from a domestic breed; and this breed has\r\nbeen easily ascertained to be that used by the Spaniards in their\r\nconquests of Mexico and Peru.  It is a race known as the Andalusian\r\nhorse--nearly allied to the Arabian--and no doubt at an earlier period\r\nimported into the peninsula of Spain by the Moors.  These horses are\r\nmuch smaller than the English hunter; but possess all the properties of\r\na true horse--the shape, action, etcetera--and cannot, therefore, be\r\nconsidered as mere _ponies_.  They are, in reality, well-blooded horses,\r\nof small stature; and no breed could be better suited to the climate of\r\nmost parts of Spanish America, where they now run wild.\r\n\r\nOn the pampas of South America these horses exist in vast droves.  The\r\nGauchos, a half-civilised race of men, live amidst their herds, and hunt\r\nthem chiefly for the hides.  They early learn to capture and ride them;\r\nand a Gaucho is seldom seen off the back of his horse.  He can capture\r\nand break one in in the course of an hour.  The flesh also serves him as\r\nan article of food.  Down as far as the Straits of Magellan the droves\r\nof wild horses are found.  There the native Indians have tamed many of\r\nthem--even the women and children going most of their time on horseback.\r\nOn the llanos, or great plains, that extend northward from the Amazon\r\nand Orinoco--that is, in the provinces of Venezuela--other droves of\r\nwild horses exist; and these, along with half-wild oxen, form the sole\r\nproperty and pursuit of a class of men called Llaneros, who in many\r\nrespects resemble the Gauchos.  Again, proceeding to North America, we\r\nfind the same species of horse running wild on the great plains to the\r\nnorth of Mexico; in California, and upon the prairies east of the Rocky\r\nMountains.  In Mexico Proper, as also in California, they are _owned_ by\r\ngreat landed proprietors; and are annually caught, branded, and sold.\r\nMany of these proprietors can count from 10,000 to 20,000 head roaming\r\nwithin the boundaries of their estates, besides large droves of horned\r\ncattle and mules.  In the vast regions between the settled parts of\r\nMexico and the frontier settlements of the United States, the wild\r\nhorses are the property of no one, but range freely over the prairies\r\nwithout mark or brand.  These are hunted and captured by different\r\ntribes of Indians--Comanches, Pawnees, Sioux, Blackfeet, etcetera, who\r\nalso possess large numbers of them tamed and trained to various uses.\r\nLike the Gauchos and Llaneros of the south, these Indians use the flesh\r\nof the horse for food, and esteem it the greatest delicacy!  Among some\r\ntribes, where the buffalo is not found, the horse takes the place of the\r\nlatter as an article of diet; and forms the principal article of\r\nsubsistence of thousands of these people.  Among most of the prairie\r\ntribes the chase of this animal, or the buffalo, is the sole pursuit of\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nStill further north ranges the wild horse, even as far as the prairies\r\nextend; and among the tribes of the Saskatchewan he is also found--used\r\nby them for the saddle, and also as a beast of burden.  In these\r\nregions, however, the buffalo still exists in great numbers; and the\r\nhorse, besides being eaten himself, is also employed to advantage in the\r\nchase of this animal.\r\n\r\nThe wild horses of America are not all exactly of one breed.  Those of\r\nthe Mexico-American prairies, called by the Spaniards _mustenos_\r\n(mustangs), differ slightly from those found upon the llanos of South\r\nAmerica; and these again from the horses of the pampas, and the\r\nparameros of Peru.  These differences, however, are but slight, and\r\nowing solely to climatic and other little causes.  But the mustangs of\r\nthe northern prairies have among them an admixture of breeds, derived\r\nfrom American runaways along the borders of the Mississippi, and others\r\nescaped from travellers on the prairies; and there have latterly been\r\ndiscovered mustangs of large size--evidently sprung from the\r\nEnglish-Arabian horse.\r\n\r\nIn the Falkland Islands the horse is also found in an untamed state.\r\nThese were introduced by the French in 1764; but have since become\r\nperfectly wild.  Strange to say, they are only found in the eastern part\r\nof the island--although the pasture there is not more rich than in the\r\nwest, and there is no natural boundary between the two!\r\n\r\nIn Asia the horse runs wild in large herds--just as in America.  The\r\nrange in which they are found in this state is chiefly on the great\r\nplains, or steppes--stretching from the Himalaya Mountains to Siberia.\r\nThe Calmuck Tartars tame them; and possess vast droves, like the Gauchos\r\nand Indians.  They also eat their flesh; and among many tribes of\r\nTartars mare\'s milk is esteemed the most delicious of beverages.\r\n\r\nAfter the true horse, the most beautiful species is the _Zebra_.  Every\r\none knows the general appearance of this handsomely marked animal, which\r\nappears as if Nature had painted his body for effect.\r\n\r\nOf the zebra there are two distinct kinds--both of them natives of\r\nAfrica, and belonging to the southern half of that great continent.\r\nThey are easily distinguished from each other by the stripes.  One of\r\nthem is literally striped to the very hoofs--the dark bands running\r\naround the limbs in the form of rings.  The stripes extend in the same\r\nway over the neck and head, to the very snout or muzzle.  This is the\r\ntrue zebra, an animal that inhabits the mountainous regions of South\r\nAfrica, and which differs altogether from the _dauw_ or Burchell\'s\r\nzebra, also found upon the great plains or karoos of the same region.\r\nThe latter has the stripes only over the body; while the head and legs\r\nare very faintly streaked, or altogether of a plain brownish colour.\r\nAttempts have been made at taming both of these kinds, and with some\r\nsuccess.  They have been trained both to the saddle and draught; but,\r\neven in the most tractable state to which they have been yet reduced,\r\nthey are considered as "treacherous, wicked, obstinate, and fickle."\r\n\r\nAnother species of horse found also in South America is the _Quagga_.\r\nThis is very much like the zebra in size, shape, and in fact everything\r\nexcept colour.  In the last respect it differs from both, in being of a\r\nplain ashy brown hue over the upper parts of the body, very indistinctly\r\nstriped, and of a dirty white colour underneath.  Like the dauw, it\r\nfrequents the open plains--trooping together in vast droves, and often\r\nherding with several species of antelopes.\r\n\r\nAnother species of quagga, called the Isabella quagga, is supposed to\r\nexist in South Africa; but there are doubts upon this subject.  The name\r\nis derived from the colour of a specimen seen by a very untrustworthy\r\ntraveller, which was of the hue known as Isabella colour; but nothing is\r\nknown of the animal, and most naturalists believe that the Isabella\r\nquagga is identical with the other species, and that the specimen\r\nreported by Le Vaillant was only a young quagga of the common kind.\r\n\r\nAll these species of African horses are generally classed with the genus\r\n_Asinus_; that is, they are considered as _asses_, not _horses_.\r\n\r\nWe now come to other species of the ass genus, which were all originally\r\nnatives of Asia.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, there is the domestic _Ass_; and of this species there are\r\nalmost as many varieties as of the horse,--some of them, as the Guddha\r\nof the Mahrattas, not larger than a mastiff, while others exist in\r\ndifferent parts of the world as large as a two-year-old heifer.  Asses\r\nare found of a pure white, and black ones are common, but the usual\r\ncolour is that to which they have given their name--the "colour of an\r\nass."\r\n\r\nBesides the domestic species, there are several others still found wild.\r\nThere is the Koulan, which is exceedingly shy and swift--so much so\r\nthat it is difficult to capture or even kill one of them; since before\r\nthe hunter can approach within rifle range of them, they take the alarm\r\nand gallop out of sight.  They live in troops, inhabiting the desert\r\nplains of Persia and Mesopotamia in winter, while in summer they betake\r\nthemselves to the mountain ranges.  They are also found on the steppes\r\nbordering the Caspian and Aral Seas.\r\n\r\nAnother species of wild ass is the Kiang.  This inhabits Thibet.  It is\r\nof a bright bay colour, and has a smooth coat; but the males are deeper\r\ncoloured than the females.  They live in troops of about a dozen\r\nindividuals under a solitary male; and frequent places where the\r\nthermometer is below zero--though they dwell indifferently either on\r\nopen plains or mountains.\r\n\r\nThe kiang has a variety of appellations, according to the country in\r\nwhich it is found.  It is the Dziggetai, and the Wild Ass of Cutch, and\r\nalso the Yototze of the Chinese; but it is very probable that all these\r\nare the names of different species.  It is further probable, that there\r\nexist several other species of wild asses in the Thibetian and Tartar\r\ncountries of Asia--and also in the vast unknown territories of\r\nNorth-eastern Africa--yet to be classified and described; for it may be\r\nhere observed that a monograph of the horse tribe alone, fully\r\ndescribing the different species and breeds, would occupy the whole life\r\nof a naturalist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE OX TRIBE.\r\n\r\nOur common domestic cattle furnish the type on which this family is\r\nfounded; and it is well-known that of this type there are many varieties\r\nin different countries.  Even in our own, so many are there, that a mere\r\nlist of their names would fill one of our pages.  We shall refrain\r\ntherefore from giving any description of the different varieties--simply\r\nremarking that they are all supposed to spring from one original.  This\r\nis, to say the least, a very doubtful hypothesis, since cattle have been\r\nfound domesticated in many countries, and the period of their first\r\nintroduction to the society of man is altogether unknown.  It is far\r\nmore likely that different species have furnished the varieties now\r\nknown as domestic cattle.\r\n\r\nWe shall proceed to describe the other bovine animals--which, although\r\nof the same family, are beyond doubt of a distinct species from the\r\ncommon cattle.\r\n\r\nThe _Zebu_ is one of the most remarkable.  Its home is India and the\r\nadjacent regions; where it branches off into almost as many varieties as\r\nthere are breeds of our own oxen.  These varieties have different names;\r\nand they differ in size, shape, and other particulars; but the hump and\r\nlong hanging dewlap render the zebu easily recognisable.\r\n\r\nIn India they are sometimes employed as beasts of the saddle and\r\ndraught; and their flesh is also eaten, though with the exception of the\r\nhump (which is esteemed a great delicacy) it is not equal to English\r\nbeef.  Among the Hindus the zebus are regarded as sanctified creatures;\r\nand to slaughter them is deemed sin.  For all that, these fanatics do\r\nnot hesitate to _work_ them--sometimes hard enough.  There are some\r\nzebus, however, that are considered more holy than common.  These may be\r\nseen wandering idly about the villages, fed from the hands of the\r\npeople; and if neglected in this regard, they walk uninvited into the\r\nrice enclosures, and help themselves!\r\n\r\nThe zebus are usually of an ashy-grey colour, though many are white; and\r\ntheir size varies from that of an ordinary calf, to the stature of a\r\nfull-grown bull.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of the zebu--or perhaps a distinct species--known as\r\nthe Dante.  It is an African animal--that is, Egypt is the country where\r\nit is chiefly found.  Very little knowledge of it exists among\r\nnaturalists.  It is distinguished from the Indian zebu by having a\r\nsmaller hump upon the withers and a narrower face; and it is supposed to\r\nbe the animal represented on the ancient Egyptian tombs.\r\n\r\nWe next come to the kind of oxen termed _Buffaloes_; and of these there\r\nare several species.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the _Indian buffalo_; and it may here be remarked, that\r\nwhen the word buffalo is used, an animal with a huge hump upon its\r\nshoulders is usually understood.  This is an error, arising, no doubt,\r\nfrom the fact that the _bison_ of America, which _has_ a hump, is\r\ngenerally called a buffalo.  But the Indian buffalo has no such\r\nprotuberance; nor yet the African species.  The Indian animal is found\r\nboth in a domesticated and wild state; but both are clearly of the same\r\nspecies.  The wild one is called the Arna, and the tame one Bhainsa, in\r\nthe language of the natives.  The former is of much greater size than\r\nthe latter--standing, when full-grown, as high as the tallest man!  So\r\nstrong are these animals, that an arna bull has been known to butt down\r\na good-sized elephant with a single stroke of his horns!\r\n\r\nIt is the Indian buffalo that is found in Italy--where it has been\r\nintroduced, and is used for draught; its great strength giving it the\r\nadvantage over horses, especially on the deep miry roads that exist in\r\nsome parts of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe _Manilla buffalo_ is a smaller variety or species of the arna,\r\ninhabiting, as its name imports, the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nThe _African buffalo_, sometimes known as the _Kaffir buffalo_, is\r\nanother of these great oxen, and not the least celebrated of the tribe.\r\nIt is an inhabitant of Africa, and is found chiefly in the southern half\r\nof that continent, from the Cape of Good Hope northwards.  It is an\r\nanimal of vast size and strength; often waging war with the lion, and\r\nfrequently with man himself.  In these encounters the buffalo is but too\r\nsuccessful; and it is asserted among the natives of South Africa, that\r\nthere are more deaths among them, caused by buffalo bulls, than by all\r\nthe other wild beasts of the country.  Like his Indian congener, the\r\nshock from the massive horns of an African buffalo is almost\r\nirresistible; and both the lion and elephant at times succumb to it.\r\n\r\nThere is a smaller African species about which less is known.  This is\r\nthe Zamouse or Bush cow, which differs from the true buffalo in having a\r\nflatter forehead, and being altogether without the dewlap.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the _American buffalo_, or _Bison_, as it should be\r\ncalled.  This is indigenous to North America; and its present range is\r\nconfined to the great prairies that extend eastward from the foot of the\r\nRocky Mountains.  It was formerly found much farther to the east--in\r\nfact, to the Atlantic coast; but its limits are now far beyond the\r\nmeridian of the Mississippi.  Hunters (both red and white) have driven\r\nit across the Rocky Mountains; and of late years it has been met with in\r\nthe territory of the Upper Columbia.  Its habits are too well-known to\r\ncall for a description here, and its shaggy coat, with the deformity of\r\nits huge shoulder-hump, are familiar to every eye.  With one exception,\r\nit is the only species of the ox tribe indigenous to America--and it may\r\nbe added, to North America--since no native bovine animal is known to\r\nexist in the southern half of the Transatlantic continent.\r\n\r\nThe _European buffalo_--or as it is sometimes called _Lithuanian\r\nbuffalo_--bears a considerable resemblance to that of the prairies.  In\r\nsize it is perhaps superior; but the two are much alike in general\r\nappearance--especially in their massive form, and the long brown hair,\r\nof woolly texture, so thickly set upon their necks and shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe European buffalo is nearly extinct, and exists only in some of the\r\nforests of Lithuanian Poland, where it is rather half-wild than wild;\r\nthat is, it freely roams the forests, but only as the deer in our own\r\nextensive parks, or the white cattle, known as the wild Scotch oxen--in\r\nother words, it has an owner.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable species is the _Yak_, or _Grunting Ox_.  This is found\r\nonly in the high, cold countries that lie to the north of the Himalayan\r\nMountains--in Thibet and Tartary.  There is only one species, but this\r\nis both wild and tame--the wild sort being the larger and more\r\nformidable animal.  The domestic variety is used by the people of Thibet\r\nfor carrying burdens; and both its milk and flesh are in great demand in\r\nthese cold countries of poverty and hunger.\r\n\r\nThe yaks dislike the warmth of summer; and during that season seek to\r\nhide themselves in the shade, or under water, in which they swim well.\r\nTheir grunt exactly resembles that of a hog.  The calves are covered\r\nwith rough black hair like a curly-haired dog; but, when three months\r\nold, they obtain the long hair that distinguishes the full-grown animal,\r\nand which hangs so low as to give it the appearance of being without\r\nlegs!  They willingly live with common cattle, and will breed with them;\r\nbut the wild yak bull is an exceedingly fierce and dangerous animal.\r\nThe tail of the grunting ox is very full, or bushy; and although the\r\nhair of the body is usually black, that upon the tail is universally of\r\na pure white.  This hair, when dyed red, is used by the Chinese to form\r\nthe tufts worn in the caps of the mandarins.  It is the _chowry_ or\r\nfly-brush of India.\r\n\r\nLike other domesticated cattle, the yak is found of different breeds--\r\nknown by the names of Noble yak, Plough yak, etcetera.\r\n\r\nNext in succession comes the _Musk Ox_ of America, which, from its long\r\nhanging hair, and also from many of its habits, bears a good deal of\r\nresemblance to the grunting ox.  The musk ox is a native of North\r\nAmerica; and there his range is confined to the most remote regions of\r\nthe Hudson\'s Bay territory.  He is met with in the inhospitable track\r\nknown as the Barren Grounds--and also along the coasts and islands of\r\nthe Arctic Ocean--but nowhere so far south as the boundary of the United\r\nStates or the Great Lakes.  But for the land expeditions of several\r\nArctic explorers, the existence of the musk ox would hardly have been\r\nknown; and, as it is, his habits are but little understood.  He is not\r\nof large size--being between the stature of an ox and a sheep--and in\r\ngeneral appearance he resembles the latter more than the former; hence,\r\namong naturalists, he is styled the Sheep ox (_ovibos_).  He and the\r\nBison, as already remarked, are the only _indigenous_ oxen of America.\r\n\r\nTo return to Asia.  In its south-eastern parts--the Indies--we find\r\nseveral other species of the ox tribe.  There is the _Gayal_ or\r\n_Jungly-gau_, which inhabits the eastern parts of Bengal, especially the\r\nmountains that separate this province from Arracan.  Of this there is a\r\ntame and wild species--the latter an inhabitant of forests, living\r\nrather upon the shoots of trees than upon grass.  It is a large animal,\r\nmore like the common ox than any of the buffaloes; and it is also less\r\nfierce in its disposition than the latter.\r\n\r\nNext to the gayal is the _Gam_--also a forest-dwelling ox, of large\r\nsize; and, like the other, browsing upon the leaves and twigs of trees.\r\n\r\nThe gam inhabits several forest-covered mountains in Central India,\r\nwhere it is only found wild.  Attempts have been made to domesticate it,\r\nbut without success--since it is both a shy and fierce animal; so much\r\nso that even the calves will not live in captivity!\r\n\r\nAnother Indian ox is the _Takin_, which inhabits the country of the\r\nKamptis, in the eastern ranges of the Himalayas, and about which there\r\nis a dispute among naturalists, as to whether _it is an ox_!\r\n\r\nWe conclude our sketch with the _Anoa_, which belongs to Celebes--a\r\nsmall species bearing some resemblance to the antelopes; and the\r\n_Banting_ or _Sumatran Ox_, a native of Java, Borneo, and also, as its\r\nsecond name denotes, of the Island of Sumatra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nSHEEP.\r\n\r\nThe Sheep is one of the animals which man has subjected to his use; and\r\none, too, of primary importance in the domestic economy of almost every\r\ncivilised nation.  Like the horse, dog, cat, ox, and pig, it has assumed\r\nthe greatest possible variety.  Many naturalists have treated these\r\nvarieties as species; but those writers of greatest authority agree in\r\nconsidering all the domestic breeds as having originated from one common\r\nstock; and it would be idle here to speculate upon this question.\r\n\r\nOf the _tame sheep_ there are not less than forty very distinct kinds,\r\nbesides numerous varieties of each of these kinds!  These, of course,\r\nare distributed among many nations, and exhibit a very great difference\r\nin point of size and general appearance.  Some are without horns, while\r\nothers have these appendages very large, and of eccentric shape; some\r\nare covered with long crisp wool; others have the wool lank and\r\nstraight; while still others have no wool at all, but instead a coat of\r\nhair resembling that of a spaniel or Newfoundland dog!  But, besides\r\nthese distinct kinds, as already stated, there are numerous varieties of\r\neach kind.  For instance, the common sheep of England is itself branched\r\nout into quite as many as twenty breeds, each of which has a name of its\r\nown, and differs from all the others in many essential characteristics.\r\n\r\nLeaving the common sheep of our own country, we shall say a few words of\r\nsome of the more noted kinds that are in the possession of different\r\nnations abroad.\r\n\r\nFrom Spain comes the Merino, so celebrated for the quality of its wool;\r\nwhile in Astracan and other Oriental countries there is a breed, the\r\nlambs of which furnish the well-known Astracan lambs\'-skin, one of the\r\nmost beautiful and valuable of furs.  The Wallachian sheep, bred in\r\nHungary, Transylvania, and the Danubian principalities, also produces a\r\nflue fur-like skin, much worn by the peasantry of Eastern Europe, in\r\njackets and cloaks termed "bundas."\r\n\r\nA very similar kind of hairy-coated sheep is propagated throughout\r\nAsiatic Russia and Siberia--the skins affording a warm and comfortable\r\nclothing for the natives of these cold countries.\r\n\r\nIn the Indian countries there are many varieties, such as the Barwall of\r\nNepaul, and also the Huniah, Cago, and Seeling, belonging to the same\r\nkingdom.  Again, in the Deccan there is a breed known as Deccan sheep,\r\nanother called Garar, and two others in Mysore denominated respectively\r\nthe Carrimbar and Shaymbliar.  China has a variety known as the Morvan,\r\nwith very long legs; and in Russia, again, there is a kind with tails so\r\nlong that their tops drag upon the ground; and another in Northern\r\nRussia, with tails so short that they appear altogether wanting!\r\n\r\nWith regard to tails, no breed has these appendages so developed as the\r\nbroad or fat-tailed sheep.  This kind is supposed to have originally\r\ncome from Barbary; but they are now propagated in different parts of the\r\nworld.  In Asia they are found among the Tartars, Persians, Buchanans,\r\nand Thibetians.  In Africa itself they are common among the Abyssinians,\r\nand are also kept in large flocks by the Dutch colonists of the Cape.\r\nThe tails of these sheep are sometimes so large and heavy, that it is\r\nwith difficulty the animals can carry them; and in some instances they\r\nare dragged along the ground as the sheep move from place to place!  The\r\nfat of which this appendage is composed is esteemed a great delicacy;\r\nand at the Cape, as elsewhere, it constitutes an important article of\r\nthe _cuisine_.\r\n\r\nThere are several other curious breeds of sheep reared in the different\r\ncountries of Africa.  These are, the Guinea sheep of the western coast;\r\nthe Morocco sheep, bred in the kingdom of the same name; the African\r\nsheep, an inhabitant of the Sahara; and the smooth-haired African sheep.\r\nThere are also the Tezzan sheep, belonging to Tripoli; the Saint Helena\r\nsheep, of the celebrated Island of Saint Helena; the Congo sheep, of\r\nCongo; and the Angolas, of the same region, famous for the quality of\r\ntheir wool--not to be confounded, however, with the Angora wool, which\r\nis the produce of a goat.  There are sheep in Tartary that eat bones\r\nlike dogs, and in Hindustan and Nepaul there are kinds that have four\r\nhorns each.  These are the Dumbas.  A little species exists in Iceland,\r\nin which the horns sometimes grow to the number of eight--though four is\r\nthe more common number.  America, too, has its varieties.  These are the\r\nBrazilian sheep, the Demerara breed, the South American sheep, and a\r\nvariety known as the West Indian.\r\n\r\nIn fact, go to whatever part of the world you may, you will find a\r\nspecies or variety of this valuable animal, different in some respects\r\nfrom all the others.\r\n\r\nThe _wild sheep_, like the wild goats, do not number a great many\r\nspecies; but there are certainly several that are yet undescribed, and\r\nperhaps there may be about a dozen in all.  No doubt the great central\r\nmountains of Asia, and also the ranges of Northern Africa, still\r\nunexplored, will in time yield several new species of wild sheep.\r\nIndeed, late travellers in the Himalayas speak of wild sheep that appear\r\nto be essentially different from the _argali_, and other species already\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nOne species of wild sheep belongs to Europe--the Moufflon, which is to\r\nthis day found plentifully in the mountainous parts of Corsica, Cyprus,\r\nand Candia.  It was supposed to be the original of the tame breeds; but\r\nthis is a mere conjecture.\r\n\r\nIn America there is also but one species of wild sheep, though it has\r\nalso a variety.  This is the Bighorn of the Rocky Mountains, lately much\r\nspoken of by prairie travellers and fur-hunters.  It is not known in\r\ntropical North America, nor does its range extend to the Andes of the\r\nsouth; but it is found to the west, in the mountains of California, in a\r\nvariety called the Californian sheep.  The bighorn is extremely like the\r\nAsiatic argali, and was for a long time regarded as identical with the\r\nlatter; but this was an error.  It is now ascertained that not only is\r\nthe American animal of another species, but also that there are several\r\ndistinct species of the argali itself in the different ranges of Asiatic\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nAfrica has its wild sheep, but only in its northern parts.  This is the\r\nAoudad, which dwells in the mountains of Barbary.\r\n\r\nAsia appears to be the head-quarters of the wild sheep.  One species is\r\nfound in Armenia, and another in the Caucasus.  Siberia has an argali,\r\nthat appears altogether to differ from the argali of the Himalayas.\r\nAgain, in the Himalayan Mountains themselves, there is one species which\r\nranges north only as far as Thibet; while on the Thibetian plateaux, as\r\nfar as the Altai Mountains, there is another, if not two other species,\r\nquite distinct from the latter.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed by competent travellers, that these Thibetian\r\nargalis bear a very strong resemblance to the different breeds of tame\r\nsheep found in the same regions; from which it may be reasonably\r\ninferred that the domesticated varieties of different countries have\r\nsprung from several wild species, instead of being all descended from\r\none common origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nGOATS.\r\n\r\nMy young readers will be surprised to hear that nothing is more\r\ndifficult than to tell a _Goat_ from a _Sheep_.  Yet such is in reality\r\nthe fact.  Of course the common goat is easily distinguished from the\r\ncommon sheep; but then there are species and varieties of both these\r\nanimals so like in shape, size, colour, and habits, that the most\r\naccomplished naturalists are unable to pronounce which are goats and\r\nwhich are sheep!  Indeed, some naturalists make no distinction at all,\r\nbut class both under the same genus.  This, however, is not a correct\r\nview, since there is an essential difference in the _nature_ of these\r\ntwo animals, notwithstanding the frequent resemblance in their outward\r\nappearance.  It was upon this very point--their _nature_--that the\r\nrenowned Buffon relied in separating them; he alleging that the sheep\r\ndiffered only from the goats in the greater gentleness and timidity of\r\ntheir disposition.  It is true that this is not a very scientific mode\r\nof classification; yet, strange to say, it is held to be one of the\r\nsafest guides for distinguishing the one from the other.  Of course, it\r\ncan only be relied upon when taken in connection with other indices of a\r\nphysical character.  Perhaps you may fancy that goats and sheep may be\r\ndistinguished from each other by the "coat"--the former having a _hairy_\r\ncoat, while that of the latter is _woolly_.  For you who reside in the\r\nBritish Islands, this mark would stand good enough, since British goats\r\nare in reality clothed with hair, and British sheep with wool; but in\r\nmany other countries the case is not only different, but directly the\r\nreverse, the goats being _woolly_, while the sheep are _hairy_!\r\n\r\nIt may be further remarked, that there are both goats and sheep so very\r\nnearly akin to antelopes, that it is again difficult to draw a line of\r\ndistinction among the three.  Indeed, there is a section of the antelope\r\ntribe, called the _goat-antelopes_, so called on account of this very\r\napproximation.  Several species of antelopes--as the chamois of the\r\nAlps, and others--are by many naturalists classed as goats; and the\r\nbighorn of the Rocky Mountains, which is a true wild sheep, is also\r\nclassed by some zoologists as a species of antelope.\r\n\r\nThe goats approach nearer to the nature of antelopes than do the sheep.\r\nIn fact, the mountain antelopes are extremely like goats in their nature\r\nand habits.  On this account the latter are supposed to stand between\r\nthe sheep and antelopes.\r\n\r\nWe shall separate the goats into two kinds: first, the _tame_ or\r\n_domesticated_ goats; and secondly, the _wild_ ones.  Of the\r\ndomesticated kind there is an endless list of varieties; and upon the\r\nquestion as to which of the wild species was the parent stock, thousands\r\nof opinions have been expressed, and long treatises written.  It is just\r\nas with the dog, and other domestic animals--no one can certainly say\r\nwhat species was first introduced to the society of human beings; and it\r\nis far more likely that it was not any one wild species, but several,\r\nand belonging to different countries, that gave origin to the numerous\r\nkinds of goats now in the possession of man.\r\n\r\nIt would be a troublesome task to describe these numerous varieties.\r\nEvery country has its kind; and, in fact, every district of country can\r\nshow a breed distinct from all the others.  Instead of specifying each\r\nbreed, we shall only mention a few of the more noted and valuable sorts.\r\n\r\nThe Thibet or Cashmere goat is perhaps the most celebrated of the tribe;\r\nits celebrity arising from the fineness of its wool, out of which are\r\nmanufactured the costly Cashmere shawls.  An attempt was made to\r\nintroduce this variety into England; but it has not been successful,\r\nthough the cause of its failure has not been communicated to the public.\r\nWe can easily find a very good reason in the fact, that a first-class\r\nCashmere shawl requires a year in its manufacture; and therefore, if an\r\nEnglish weaver were to have the raw material for nothing, his labour\r\nwould amount to more than the shawl was worth in the market!  It is just\r\nthe same with the culture of the tea-plant.  There are many districts in\r\nAmerica where the tea-tree would flourish as well as in China; but what\r\nwould be the use of growing it there, since the labour required to bring\r\nit to a state of readiness for the teapot would also raise it to an\r\nunsaleable price!  These are the important principles that people who\r\ntalk of protective duties entirely lose sight of.\r\n\r\nThe best Cashmere goats are brought from the Thibet country; and then\r\nwool sells for a rupee a pound in Cashmere itself.  It is spun by the\r\nwomen, and afterwards dyed.  The persons employed in making the shawls\r\nsit on a bench around the frame.  If it be a _pattern_ shawl, four\r\npersons labour at its manufacture; but a plain one requires only two.\r\nThe borders are marked with wooden needles, there being a separate\r\nneedle for each colour; and the rough side of the shawl is uppermost\r\nwhile it is being made.\r\n\r\nThe best shawls are manufactured in the kingdom of Cashmere itself,\r\nthough many are made in other Oriental countries, and also in France;\r\nand the wool of several varieties of the goat, besides the Thibet, is\r\nused in the manufacture.  In Cashmere alone 30,000 shawls are made\r\nannually--giving employment to about 50,000 people.\r\n\r\nThe Angora goat is another noted variety--esteemed for its fine silky\r\nhair.  It inhabits the countries of Angora and Beibazar, in Asiatic\r\nTurkey, where it is kept in large flocks, the goatherds bestowing much\r\ncare upon the animals--frequently combing and washing them!\r\n\r\nThe Syrian goat, remarkable for its excessively long ears, is reared in\r\nAleppo and other parts of Asiatic Turkey, and is kept for the use of its\r\nmilk, with which many of the towns are supplied.\r\n\r\nThere are other varieties less noted, among which may be mentioned the\r\nSpanish goats, without horns; the Juda, or African goat, with two hairy\r\nwattles under the chin; and the pretty little Whidaw goat--also a small\r\nAfrican variety.  There is also a Nepaul goat, and one belonging to the\r\nDeccan, called Bukee--a very large gaunt fellow, with long shaggy hair.\r\nThe Irish goat, too, is a peculiar variety of the common or domestic\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nTame goats are distributed very generally over all the Old World.  They\r\nthrive well in the cold climate of Norway; and are equally at home in\r\nthe hottest parts of Africa and the Indian islands.  In America they are\r\nrare, in the territory inhabited by the Anglo-Saxon races--it not being\r\nconsidered a valuable speculation to "raise" them; but throughout the\r\nSpanish territories, both in North and South America, large flocks may\r\nbe seen, and the wild goats of Juan Fernandez are descendants of these\r\nSpanish-American domesticated breeds.\r\n\r\nThe species of true _wild goats_ are not numerous, but are very\r\ngenerally distributed over the world--particularly over the old\r\ncontinents.  In America only one wild species is indigenous: that is,\r\nthe Rocky Mountain goat.  Some authors have asserted that this species\r\nis not indigenous to America; but most certainly this statement is an\r\nerror.  From its peculiar appearance, as well as from the locality in\r\nwhich it is found, it could never have sprung from any known\r\ndomesticated breed.  It is a long-haired creature, snow-white in colour,\r\nand with very short straight horns.  Its hair is of silky hue and\r\nfineness, and hangs so low that the animal appears as if without legs.\r\nIts skin makes one of the most beautiful of saddle covers; and for this\r\npurpose it is used; but the animal itself being rare, and only found in\r\nthe most remote and inaccessible regions of the Rocky Mountains, a good\r\nskin is as costly as it is valuable.  It is met with in the great\r\ncentral range, from Northern Mexico, as far north as the Rocky Mountains\r\nextend; and it is supposed also to exist among the higher summits of the\r\nCalifornian mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Ibex is another species of wild goat, somewhat celebrated.  It is\r\nthe wild goat of the European Alps, where it is known by the Germans as\r\nStein-boc, and as Bouquetin among the French.\r\n\r\nAnother ibex belongs to the Caucasian Mountains, called Zebudor, or\r\nHach; and still another kind inhabits the Himalayas, where it passes\r\nunder the name of Sakeen.  There is also an ibex in Siberia; and still\r\nanother in the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, there is a large wild goat in the loftiest\r\nHimalayas, known as the Jaral, or Tur; and another in India called the\r\nJungle Kemas, or Wild Sheep of Tenasserim.  In Northern Africa, again,\r\nthere are several species of native wild goats, as the Jaela in Egypt,\r\nand the Walie of the African-Arab countries; but in South Africa no\r\nindigenous wild goats have been observed--their place in that region\r\nbeing supplied by their near congeners the Klipspringers, and other\r\nrock-loving antelopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nANTELOPES.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope tribe is so closely related to that of the Deer, that it is\r\noften difficult to distinguish one from the other.  Indeed, certain\r\nspecies of antelopes are more like to certain species of deer, than\r\neither to their own kind.  This is more especially true of the females,\r\nwhere the horns--the chief point of distinction--are absent.  In such\r\ncases, even the accomplished naturalist is perplexed by the close\r\nresemblance--which extends beyond mere outward appearance, and is found\r\nthroughout all their habits.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, however, that the different species of antelopes\r\ndiffer not only in size, shape, and colour, but quite as much in their\r\nmodes of existence.  Some, like the African Eland and the Nyl-ghau of\r\nIndia, are clumsy creatures both in shape and movements; while others,\r\nas the Gazelles, are models of symmetry and grace.  Some are dwellers in\r\nthe arid recesses of the desert; while others affect the most fertile\r\npastures, or the deepest shades of the thick forest.  Others, again,\r\nfind their home amidst the sedge on the banks of lakes and rivers,\r\npassing half their time in the water; while several species--as the\r\nChamois of Europe and the Klipspringer of South Africa--dwell in the\r\nmountains, making their way among cliffs and ravines, with an agility\r\nscarce equalled by any other animal.  Again, some species are\r\ngregarious, and herd together in vast flocks; while others are found\r\nonly in small droves, or families, and not a few species lead what is\r\ntermed a solitary life.  In all these respects the antelopes resemble\r\nthe deer; and, indeed, no very marked distinction can be pronounced\r\nbetween the two.  As already remarked, the main point of difference,\r\nupon which scientific naturalists rely, is found in the horns; those of\r\nthe deer being termed osseous, or bony, while these appendages in the\r\nantelopes are true horns--that is, of the same material as the horns of\r\noxen.  Furthermore, the horns--or rather antlers--of the deer are\r\ncaducous, shedding annually; while those of the antelopes are\r\npersistent, remaining throughout the life-time of the animal--as with\r\ngoats, sheep, and oxen.\r\n\r\nThe antelopes appear to stand, as it were, in a central position,\r\nsurrounded by these three last-mentioned groups; in other words, there\r\nare species of antelopes that can scarcely be distinguished from goats,\r\nothers equally like sheep, and others that come very near being true\r\noxen!  Nay, further, there are one or two species--the Gnus of South\r\nAfrica--that bear a considerable resemblance to horses!\r\n\r\nAt one time the antelopes were all classed in a single genus; but since\r\nthe species have increased--or rather the knowledge of them--this\r\narrangement has been deemed inconvenient; and the systematic naturalists\r\nhave separated them into a great many genera--twenty or more--and to\r\nthese genera they have given such a variety of pedantic titles, that it\r\nwould be wellnigh impossible for one man\'s memory to retain them all.  I\r\ndo not hesitate to say, that it would have been much wiser to have\r\nretained the nomenclature of the old naturalists, and called all these\r\nanimals _antelopes_--leaving the specific appellations to distinguish\r\nthem from one another.\r\n\r\nIn a popular sketch it is necessary to treat them in this way; for to\r\ngive even a list of the generic characters of the systematic naturalists\r\nwould occupy the whole of our space.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, of the number of these ruminants--that is, the number of\r\nkinds.  In this respect they exceed the deer tribe, amounting in all to\r\nbetween eighty and ninety distinct kinds.  Perhaps there are one hundred\r\nspecies upon the whole earth, since several new ones have been recently\r\ndiscovered in the interior regions of Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that Africa is the great head-quarters\r\nof the antelope tribe--more than half the species belonging to that\r\ncontinent.  In number of individuals, too, it far excels; the vast herds\r\nof these animals that roam over the karoos and great plains of South\r\nAfrica consisting sometimes of numbers countless as locusts or the sands\r\nof the sea!  Asia, however, is not without its share of species; and\r\nespecially that portion of it--the Oriental region--so rich in other\r\nmammalia.  In Australia no antelope has yet been found; nor even in the\r\nlarge island of Madagascar, so African in its character.  Only one\r\nrepresentative of the antelopes is indigenous to the New World--the\r\nProng-horn of the prairies; for the Bighorn of the Rocky Mountains is a\r\nsheep, not an antelope.  To say the least, this is a natural fact of\r\nsome singularity; for from all we know of the habits of these animals,\r\nno country could be better suited to their existence than the great\r\nprairies of North America, or the llanos of the Orinoco, the paramos of\r\nBrazil, and the pampas of Buenos Ayres and Patagonia.  And yet on these\r\nSouth American plains no animal of the genus _antelope_ has yet been\r\ndiscovered;--and on the prairies, as already mentioned, only one\r\nspecies, the Prong-horn.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, also, that in Africa, where the antelopes most\r\nabound, no deer are found to exist in the few African species of the\r\nlatter being denizens only of the extreme north of Africa, where that\r\ncontinent approximates in character to the southern countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Europe there are two species--the well-known Chamois of the Alps, and\r\nthe Saiga of Eastern Europe, which last is also an Asiatic animal.\r\n\r\nIn describing the different species--and we can only say a word or two\r\nof each--we shall class them, not according to generic distinctions, but\r\nrather by their geographical distribution; and we shall begin with the\r\n_Antelopes of Africa_.\r\n\r\nOf these the Eland is the largest (as it also is the largest of\r\nantelopes), being sometimes of the size and weight of a full-grown\r\nhorse!  It is an animal of rather an ungainly appearance; but its\r\nbeautiful buff colour and mild disposition make up for its ungraceful\r\nshape; and it is scarcely ever out of good condition.  Its home is\r\nSouthern Africa, where it is still found in large herds; and its flesh\r\naffords a plentiful subsistence both to travellers and the half-savage\r\nnatives of the land.\r\n\r\nHunting the eland is a common pastime; and no craft is required to\r\ninsure success, since these creatures are almost as tame as domestic\r\ncattle; so tame that the horseman usually rides into the middle of the\r\ndrove, and, singling out the fattest bull, shoots him down without any\r\ndifficulty.  The eland thrives well in England; and Dr Livingstone\r\nremarks it strange that it has not long since been introduced to our\r\npastures--since its flesh is better than beef, and the animal itself is\r\nas large as an ox.\r\n\r\nThe Gingi Jonga is a distinct variety of the eland, found in Western\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe Koodoo is another large species, of which South Africa is the home.\r\nThis is remarkable for a noble appearance; but its most striking\r\ncharacteristic is its magnificent horns--each of which is four feet in\r\nlength, sweeping widely outwards in an elegant spiral curvature.  The\r\nkoodoo loves the shade of the forest, and especially delights to dwell\r\non the banks of rivers--taking freely to the water and swimming well.\r\n\r\nThe Gnu next merits attention.  In point of fact this is the most\r\nsingular of the whole genus--being that which in many respects resembles\r\nthe horse.  There are two kinds, both belonging to South Africa, and\r\nknown as the Gnu and Brindled Gnu.  When seen galloping at a distance,\r\nthey bear a marked resemblance to quaggas, or wild horses.  They live in\r\nextensive herds on the karoos; and are hunted by the natives for their\r\nskins--out of which the Kaffirs make their karosses.  Their flesh is\r\neaten; though it is not so much esteemed as that of some other\r\nantelopes.\r\n\r\nThe Oryx, or Gemsbok, is a middle-sized species, dwelling in the same\r\nneighbourhood with the gnus.  It is a heavy, stout animal, with a long\r\nbunch tail, and a pair of tapering slender horns, almost perfectly\r\nstraight, and sweeping back towards the shoulders.  It is truly a\r\ncreature of the open desert plains; and can go for a long time without\r\nwater.  It is bold and dangerous--especially when wounded--and will give\r\nbattle to the hunter even, it is said, when that hunter chances to be\r\nthe lion himself!\r\n\r\nThe true Oryx, or Milk-white Antelope, mentioned by early writers, is a\r\nkindred species to the Gemsbok; and is found in Northern Africa--in\r\nSennaar, Nubia, Abyssinia, and Senegal.  This last is a celebrated\r\nspecies, on account of the supposition that it is the animal figured on\r\nthe temples of Egypt, and known as the _Unicorn_.  It would not be\r\ndifficult, I imagine, to point out the absurdity of this belief; and to\r\nprove that the Unicorn of the ancients was either the Gnu of South\r\nAfrica, or an allied species--supposed to exist at the present time in\r\nthe inter-tropical region of the same continent.\r\n\r\nA third species of oryx, the Beisa, inhabits Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nThe Addax is a large, heavily-formed antelope, with spiral horns and\r\nox-like appearance, inhabiting the greater part of the Central African\r\nregion.  It frequents sandy plains, and is noted for its broad hoofs,\r\nwhich seem designed to prevent it from sinking in the soft yielding sand\r\nof the desert.  The addax is not gregarious, living in pairs or\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nOne of the handsomest of South African antelopes is the Water Buck, a\r\nfine large species, with long, widely-spreading horns.  It is called\r\nWater Buck on account of its habit of frequenting the marshy banks of\r\nrivers and lakes, where it spends most of its time half immersed in the\r\nwater!\r\n\r\nThe Lechee is another species, allied to this, and of very similar\r\nhabits; and two, if not three species of _water_ antelopes have been\r\nlately discovered by Livingstone and other South African explorers.  The\r\nSing-sing is an antelope belonging to Western Africa.  The English on\r\nthe Gambia call it the "Jackass Deer," from its resemblance to a donkey.\r\nThe negroes believe that its presence has a sanitary effect upon their\r\ncattle; and hardly a flock is seen without having one or two sing-sings\r\nalong with it.  A similar fancy is entertained in our own country in\r\nregard to the common goat--many people keeping one in their stables,\r\nunder the belief that it is beneficial to the health of the horses!\r\n\r\nAnother Sing-sing is the Equitoon, or Kob, of Senegal--often confounded\r\nwith the former species.\r\n\r\nA very beautiful antelope is the Blue buck, or Blauwboc of the Cape\r\ncolonists.  It is a large, bold animal, with horns ringed, and gently\r\ncurving backwards.  Its skin is jet black; and it is this colour\r\nreflected through the ashy-grey hair that gives the animal that purplish\r\nor blue tint, whence it derives its name.  It is found in small troops\r\non the plains north of Kurrichane; and when wounded, or in the rutting\r\nseason, the males are dangerous creatures.  Another similar species, but\r\nlarger, is the Tah-kaitze, which is plentiful in the country of the\r\nBechuanas.  It is so ferocious in its disposition, that the native\r\nhunters fear to attack it with the asseghai; but prefer capturing it in\r\npitfalls.\r\n\r\nThe Black buck is a species of similar character and habits; and in\r\nSenegal there is one, not unlike the foregoing, known among the French\r\nas _vache-brune_, and called by the Mandingoes _white mouth_.\r\n\r\nThe Pallah is another fine species of South African antelope.  Its horns\r\nare of the lyrate form, and its colour a bright rufous.  It is on this\r\naccount known among the Dutch colonists as the Rooye-boc (Red buck).  It\r\nruns in small troops, and is found in the country of the Bechuanas, who\r\nhunt it for its flesh.\r\n\r\nThe Stein-boc is one of the slenderest and most graceful of antelopes.\r\nIt lives upon stony plains and in mountain valleys in South Africa--\r\nhence its name of _stein-boc_, or stone buck.  It is very swift, and,\r\nwhen at full speed, will often spring over fifteen feet at a single\r\nleap.  Its flesh is much prized, and on this account it is hunted\r\neagerly by the natives; so that, although one of the swiftest of\r\nanimals, it is now rare in most parts of the Cape colony.\r\n\r\nThe Grys-boc is a closely allied species, but not so elegantly formed,\r\nnor yet so swift.  It hides when closely pursued--thrusting its head\r\ninto a bush, or squatting like a hare in her form.  The stein-boc has a\r\nsimilar habit.\r\n\r\nThe Bleek-boc, or Ourebi, is one of those antelopes which have the\r\ncurious appendages upon the knees called brushes.  It is a large animal,\r\nand its flesh is eaten by the Kaffirs, in whose country it is chiefly\r\nfound.  A very similar species, called the _gibari_, exists in Northern\r\nAfrica--Abyssinia--and also on the western coast.\r\n\r\nOf all the South African antelopes, perhaps none is more known and\r\nadmired than the Spring-boc (springbuck).  Its name is derived from a\r\ncurious habit the animal has of, every now and then, springing upward\r\nfrom the ground, while going at full speed across the plains.  This leap\r\nis sometimes made to the height of many feet, in an almost perpendicular\r\ndirection, and apparently without any other motive than for amusement!\r\nThe spring-bucks are eminently gregarious; indeed, they may be said to\r\nswarm.  Herds have been met with, numbering as many as 50,000\r\nindividuals, migrating from one part of the country to the other, and\r\npaying but little heed to the crowds of hyenas, wild dogs, and other\r\npredatory creatures, who keep them company only to destroy and devour\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Klipspringer is a small antelope that inhabits the most inaccessible\r\nmountains of Southern Africa; and, like its near congener, the chamois\r\nof the Alps, is as much at home on the narrow ledges of cliffs as its\r\nkindred are upon the open plains.  It is a long-haired, shaggy little\r\ncreature; but its long hair does not protect it from the bullet of the\r\nhunter; and its young frequently fall victims to the eagle, and the\r\ngreat lammer-geyer vulture, which also dwells among these mountains.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those described, there are many other species of\r\nantelopes in Africa.  The Duyker-boc, or Diving-buck--so called from its\r\nhabit of ducking or diving under the bushes when pursued--is a Cape\r\nspecies; and there is another diving-buck, called the Black-faced; and\r\nstill another of these bush antelopes, termed Burchell\'s bush-boc.  Then\r\nthere is the Four-tufted antelope of Senegal; the Red-crowned bush-boc,\r\nalso of Western Africa; and, belonging to the same region, the\r\nWhite-backed bush-boc.  In the Island of Fernando Po there is found the\r\nBlack-striped bush-boc; and in Abyssinia, the Madoqua, or Abyssinian\r\nbush-goat, of a yellow colour.  The Bay bush-buck and Bay bush-goat are\r\ntwo species described as natives of Sierra Leone; while the Black\r\nbush-boc, of a sooty black colour, is found on the coast of Guinea.\r\n\r\nThe Coquetoon is a species of a deep-reddish bay colour, belonging to\r\nWestern Africa; and on the Senegal and Gambia we meet with another sooty\r\nspecies, called the Guevei.  At Port Natal, in South Africa, there is a\r\nred species called the Natal bush-boc; and the Kleene-boc, a diminutive\r\nlittle creature, only about twelve inches in height--a very pigmy among\r\nthe antelopes--also belongs to the same region.  Several other small\r\nspecies--or pigmy antelopes, as they are termed--are found along the\r\nwest coast of Africa, viz., the Black-rumped guevei of Fernando Po; the\r\nGrisled guevei of Sierra Leone; and the White-footed guevei of the same\r\nregion.  The little creature known as the Royal antelope, or\r\nGuinea-musk, is a native of Guinea.  Still others in South Africa are\r\nthe Ree-boc and the Reed-boc--the latter deriving its name from its\r\nhabit of frequenting the reeds that grow along the banks of the South\r\nAfrican rivers.  In the Island of Zanzibar there is a very small species\r\nof antelope; and another found in Abyssinia, and called also the\r\nMadoqua, is said to be the smallest of all horned animals--being not so\r\nlarge as an English hare!\r\n\r\nIn North Africa--in the Sahara Desert--exists a large species, called by\r\nthe Arabs the Wild Ox.  It is one of the clumsiest in shape of the whole\r\ntribe.  In the south two kinds are near akin to it--the Harte-beest or\r\nSecaama, and the Sassaby or Bastard harte-beest.  The Korrigun is\r\nanother of these large antelopes, belonging to Western Africa; and the\r\nBonte-boc and Bles-boc are two similar kinds, existing in the country of\r\nthe Hottentots.  The Bosch-boc, or Bush-goat, is still another of the\r\nsouthern antelopes, which derives its name from its dwelling-place--the\r\nbushy thickets--out of which it never shows itself; and, in addition to\r\nall these, there is the Decula of Abyssinia, the Guib of the western\r\ncoast, the Ingala of Natal, and the Broad-horned antelope of the Bight\r\nof Biafra.\r\n\r\nWe have not yet mentioned the _Gazelles_, which are, perhaps, the most\r\ninteresting of all the antelope tribe.  It is not necessary to describe\r\ntheir forms, or dilate upon the gracefulness of their movements and\r\nappearance.  Their beautiful eyes have been a theme for the admiration\r\nof all ages.  We shall only remark here, that there are several species\r\nof antelopes called gazelles, and that they are all natives of Africa.\r\nThere is the Dorcas gazelle of Egypt, Barbary, and Asia Minor; the\r\nIsabella gazelle of Egypt and Kordofan; the Mhorr of Western Africa; the\r\nAbyssinian mhorr of the eastern parts of the continent; the Andora of\r\nSennaar, Dongola, and Kordofan; and, lastly, the Korin.  These are all\r\ngazelles; and it is believed that several other species may yet be found\r\nin the interior parts of Africa.  Such is the list of African antelopes.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Asiatic species, we can only find space to give their\r\nnames, and point out the localities they inhabit.\r\n\r\nThe Nyl-ghau claims to be mentioned first, as it is one of the largest\r\nantelopes known.  It inhabits the dense forests of India, and is a\r\ncreature of interesting and singular habits.  The Goral and Serow are\r\nalso two large species inhabiting the Himalayas--especially in the\r\nkingdom of Nepaul--while the Chousinga is a denizen of the wooded plains\r\nof Bengal, Behar, and Orissa.  Two others, Chousingas, are the Rusty red\r\nand Full horned, both natives of India; and the Jungliburka, a species\r\nfound in the Bombay Presidency.  In Persia we find the well-known Sasin,\r\nor common antelope, as it is usually called; and in the Oriental\r\nIslands, Sumatra furnishes us with the Cambing outan, and Japan with the\r\nJapanese goat antelope.  The Mahrattas have the Chikara, or Ravine-deer,\r\na species peculiar to the rocky hills of the Deccan.  China is not\r\nwithout its representative in the Whang-yang, or yellow-goat, which also\r\ninhabits the arid deserts of Central Asia, Thibet, and Southern Siberia.\r\nThe Goa is another Thibetian species; and this ends our list of the\r\ntribe: for the two European antelopes, the Chamois and Saiga, and the\r\none peculiar to the prairies of North America--the Prong-horn--have\r\nalready received mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nDEER.\r\n\r\nOf these graceful quadrupeds there are nearly fifty species known to the\r\nscientific naturalist.  These are geographically distributed throughout\r\nthe continents of Europe, Asia, and America; and several belong to the\r\ngreat Indian islands.  In Africa we find only two kinds, and these\r\nconfined to the mountain regions near the coast of the Mediterranean\r\nSea.  Throughout the central and southern parts of that vast continent\r\nno native deer exist; but their place is plentifully supplied by their\r\nvery near kindred the antelopes--for which, as already seen, Africa is\r\nespecially famous.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident to my young readers, that anything like a detailed\r\ndescription of fifty different kinds of animals would take up a volume\r\nof itself.  I must therefore content myself with giving a brief account\r\nof the more remarkable species, and a word or two only about those less\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nIf size entitle a species to precedence, then decidedly the _Elk_ should\r\nstand first.  He is the largest of the deer tribe--not unfrequently\r\nstanding as high as a horse, and carrying upon his crown a pair of\r\nbroad, flat-branched antlers, weighing sixty pounds!  Although truly an\r\nanimal of the deer kind, he lacks those graceful shapes and proportions\r\nthat characterise most of his congeners; and his mode of progression--a\r\nsort of shambling trot--is awkward in the extreme.  While the animal is\r\nin the act of running, its long split hoofs strike together, giving out\r\na series of singular sounds that resemble the crackling of castanets.\r\nIn the elk countries of North America the native Indians prize the\r\nskins--dressing them into a soft pliable leather.  The flesh is also\r\neaten; but it is inferior to the venison of either the fallow or red\r\ndeer.\r\n\r\nThe elk belongs equally to the Old and New Worlds.  His range is the\r\nwooded countries of high latitudes in the north, both of Europe and\r\nAsia; and in America he is found in similar situations.  In the latter\r\ncontinent he is called the Moose; and the name Elk is there erroneously\r\ngiven to another and more southern species--the Wapiti--to be noticed\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nIn North America the range of the elk may be defined by regarding the\r\nboundary-line of the United States and Canada as its southern limit.\r\nFormerly elks were met with as far south as the Ohio--now they are rare\r\neven in Wisconsin.  In Canada, and northward to the shores of the Arctic\r\nSea, wherever timber is plenteous, the great moose deer dwell.  They\r\nroam in small herds--or perhaps only families, consisting of six or\r\nseven individuals--and feed chiefly on the leaves of plants and trees.\r\nTheir legs are so long, and their necks so short, that they cannot graze\r\non the level ground, but, like the giraffes of Africa, are compelled to\r\nbrowse on the tops of tall plants, and the twigs and leaves of trees, in\r\nthe summer; while in the winter they feed on the tops of the willows and\r\nsmall birches, and are never found far from the neighbourhood where such\r\ntrees grow.  Though they have no fore-teeth in their upper jaw, yet they\r\nare enabled somehow or other to crop from the willows and birch trees\r\ntwigs of considerable thickness, cutting them off as clean as if the\r\ntrees were pruned by a gardener\'s shears.\r\n\r\nThe moose is a sly animal, and in early winter all the craft of the\r\nhunter is required to capture it.  In summer it is easier to do so:\r\nthese animals are then so tormented with mosquitoes and gnats, that they\r\nbecome almost heedless of the approach of their more dangerous enemy,\r\nman.  In winter the hunter follows the moose by his track, easily\r\ndiscovered in the snow; but it is necessary to approach from the\r\nleeward, as the slightest sound borne to his ear upon the breeze is\r\nsufficient to start him off.  A very singular habit of the moose adds to\r\nthe difficulty of approaching him.  When he has the intention to repose,\r\nhe turns sharply out of the general track he has been following, and\r\nthen, making a circuit, lies down, his body being hidden by the\r\nsurrounding snow.  In this lair he can hear any one passing along the\r\ntrack he has made; and, thus warned, his escape is easy.  The hunter who\r\nunderstands his business can usually give a guess (from a survey of the\r\nground) of where these detours are likely to be taken, and takes his\r\nmeasures accordingly.  When within range, the hunter usually makes some\r\nnoise, as by snapping a twig: the moose starts to his feet, and shows\r\nhimself above the snow.  For a moment he squats on his hams, before\r\nstarting off.  This is the fatal moment, for it is the time for the\r\nhunter to take sure aim and send the fatal bullet.  If the shot prove\r\nonly a slight wound, and not mortal, the moose sometimes turns upon his\r\nenemy; and if a friendly tree be not convenient, the hunter stands a\r\ngood chance of being trampled to death.  In the rutting season the moose\r\nwill assail even man himself without provocation; and at such times the\r\nold "bulls" (as the hunters term the males) have terrible conflicts with\r\none another.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the elk of Northern Europe appear to be identical with the\r\nmoose of America.  Hunting it in Sweden and Norway is a favourite sport,\r\nand its flesh is eaten, the nose and tongue being esteemed great\r\ndelicacies, as they are in America.  It is related that elks were\r\nformerly used in Sweden to draw the sledge; but, for certain reasons,\r\nthis was prohibited by law.\r\n\r\nIn point of size, the _Wapiti_ stands next to the elk.  In shape he\r\nresembles the well-known Stag or Red Deer of our parks, but is much\r\nlarger.  The wapiti is exclusively a native of North America; and it may\r\nbe remarked that his range is more southerly, and not so northerly as\r\nthat of the moose.  He is not found so far south as the Southern States,\r\nnor farther north than the Canadas; but around the great lakes, and\r\nwestward to the Rocky Mountains, and even to the Pacific, the wapiti is\r\nmet with.  He is a noble creature--perhaps the noblest of the deer\r\ntribe--and it is a boast of the backwoods\' hunter to have killed an elk;\r\nfor such, as already mentioned, is the name erroneously given to this\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the _Reindeer_ is the most celebrated of all the deer; and just\r\non that account I shall say but little of this species, since its habits\r\nare familiar to every one.  Every one has read of the Laplander and his\r\nreindeer--how these people have tamed and trained, and otherwise\r\nsubmitted it to a variety of useful purposes; but the Laplanders are not\r\nthe only people who have to do with the reindeer.  The tribes of the\r\nTungusians and Tchutski, who inhabit the northern parts of Asia, have\r\nalso trained it to various uses--as a beast of burden, and also to ride\r\nupon.  The variety--perhaps it is a distinct species--which the\r\nTungusians employ for the saddle, is much larger than that of the\r\nLaplanders; but it may be remarked that there are also varieties in\r\nLapland itself.  The same remark applies to the reindeer of America,\r\nwhich is found in the northern parts of the Hudson\'s Bay territory, and\r\nall along the shores of the Arctic Ocean, making its way over frozen\r\nseas, even to the islands that lie around the pole.  In these desolate\r\ncountries the Caribou (for by such name is the reindeer known in\r\nAmerica) is hunted by both Indians and Esquimaux; but it has never been\r\ntrained by either race to any useful purpose, and is only sought for as\r\nfurnishing an important article of food and clothing.  At least two\r\nkinds of Caribou exist in the vast tracts of almost unknown country\r\nknown as Prince Rupert\'s Land, or the Hudson\'s Bay territory.\r\n\r\nAs the three kinds described belong--at least partially--to the New\r\nWorld, we shall finish with the other deer of this hemisphere, before\r\nproceeding to those peculiar to the Old World.\r\n\r\nThe _Virginian Deer_ is the species common to the United States proper,\r\nand, in fact, the only wild species now found in the greater number in\r\nthe States.  It is a small animal, very similar to the fallow-deer of\r\nEurope; and several varieties (or species), not differing much from the\r\nVirginian deer, exist throughout the forests of Mexico, California,\r\nOregon, and South America.  In Mexico there are three or four species,\r\nseverally known as the Mexican Deer, the Mazama, the Cariacou, and by\r\nother appellations.  Of course, the inhabitants simply know them as\r\nvenados (deer).  In Guyana there are one or two small species, and along\r\nthe forest-covered sides of the Andes two or three more.  In Bolivia\r\nthere is a large kind known as the Tarush; and on the pampas of Buenos\r\nAyres and Patagonia is a kind called Guazuti, which associates in large\r\nherds, and is remarkable for the powerful odour emitted by the bucks.\r\n\r\nIn the forests of the Amazon, and all through the Brazilian country,\r\ndeer exist of different species; several, as the Guazuviva, the Pita,\r\nthe Eyebrowed Brocket, and the Large-eared Brocket, being tiny little\r\ncreatures, not much larger than the fawns of the ordinary species.\r\n\r\nReturning to North America, we find several varieties of the Virginian\r\nDeer in the countries lying along the Pacific coast--viz., California,\r\nOregon, and Russian America.  These have received trivial names, though\r\nit is believed that they are only varieties, as mentioned above.  Two,\r\nhowever, appear to be specifically different from the Virginian deer.\r\nOne of these is the Mule Deer of the Rocky Mountains--almost as large as\r\nthe red deer of our own country, and well-known to the trappers of the\r\nUpper Missouri.  Another is a well-marked species, on account of the\r\nlength of its tail--whence it has received its hunter appellation of the\r\nLong-tailed Deer.\r\n\r\nThe _Deer of Europe_ are not numerous in species; but if we consider the\r\nlarge herds shut up in parks, they are perhaps as plentiful in numbers\r\nas elsewhere, over a like extent of territory.\r\n\r\nThe _Reindeer_ and _Elk_, as already stated, are both indigenous to\r\nEurope; so also the _Stag_ or _Red Deer_, the greatest ornament of our\r\nparks.  The red deer runs wild in Scotland, and in most of the great\r\nforests of Europe and Asia.  There are also varieties of this noble\r\nanimal, a small one being found in the mountains of Corsica.\r\n\r\nThe _Fallow-Deer_ is too well-known to need description.  It is enough\r\nto say that it exists wild in most countries of Europe, our own\r\nexcepted.  Into this country it is supposed to have been introduced from\r\nDenmark.\r\n\r\nThe _Roebuck_, another species of our parks, is indigenous to both\r\nEngland and Scotland.  It is now found plentiful only in the northern\r\nparts of Great Britain.  It is a native also of Italy, Sweden, Norway,\r\nand Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe _African Deer_ consist of two species, supposed to be varieties of\r\nred deer.  They are found in Barbary, and usually known as the Barbary\r\nDeer.  But the fallow-deer also exists in North Africa, in the woods of\r\nTunis and Algiers; and Cuvier has asserted that the fallow-deer\r\noriginally came from Africa.  This is not probable, since they are at\r\npresent met with over the whole continent of Asia, even in China itself.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the species more especially termed _Asiatic_ or _Indian\r\nBeer_.  These form a numerous group, containing species that differ\r\nessentially from each other.\r\n\r\nThere is the _Ritsa_, or Great Black Stag of the Japanese and Sumatrans.\r\nIt is named _black_ stag, from its dark brown colour during winter.  It\r\nis fully as large as our own stag; and is further distinguished by long\r\nhair growing upon the upper part of its neck, cheeks, and throat, which\r\ngives it the appearance of having a beard and mane!  It inhabits Bengal,\r\nand some of the large Indian islands.\r\n\r\nThe _Samboo_, or _Sambur_, is another large species, not unlike the\r\nrusa.  It is found in various parts of India, and especially in the\r\ntropical island of Ceylon.  Several varieties of it have been described\r\nby naturalists.\r\n\r\nIn the Himalaya Mountains there exist two or three species of large\r\ndeer, not very well-known.  One is the Saul Forest Stag, or Bara-singa--\r\na species almost as large as the Canadian wapiti.  Another is the Marl,\r\nor Wallich\'s Stag, which is also found in Persia.  Still another\r\nspecies, the Sika, inhabits Japan; and yet another, the Baringa, or\r\nSpotted Deer of the Sunderbunds, dwells along the marshy rivers of this\r\nlast-mentioned territory.  Again, there is the Spotted Rusa, and other\r\nspecies, inhabitants of the Saul Forests.  In fact, the number of\r\nspecies of Indian deer is far from being accurately ascertained, to say\r\nnothing of the very imperfect descriptions given of those that are\r\nactually known.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the great Oriental islands--the Isles of Ind--we find\r\nmany new and beautiful species; some being large noble stags, while\r\nothers are tiny graceful little creatures like gazelles.\r\n\r\nIn Sumatra and Borneo we have a distinct species of Sambur Deer; in\r\nTimor a smaller one; a third exists in Java; and a fourth in the\r\nPhilippines.  In Java, too, we find the beautiful little Muntjak; and\r\nanother tiny variety in China, called the Chinese Muntjak.\r\n\r\nReturning again to the Himalaya country, we encounter, in the plains\r\nsouth of this great chain, the Spotted Axis, so well-known from its\r\nbeautiful markings, which resemble those of the fawn of our own\r\nfallow-deer.  But it may be remarked that there are two or three species\r\nof spotted deer, and that they inhabit the plains of India--from the\r\nHimalayas southward to the Island of Ceylon.  Ascending these great\r\nmountains, we encounter among their lower slopes another very singular\r\nspecies of cervine creature--the Musk Deer--which, though but little\r\nknown, is one of the most interesting of its tribe; especially so, as it\r\nis from the secreting glands of this curious little animal that most of\r\nthe celebrated perfume of commerce is obtained.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Himalayas, and advancing northwards, we find upon the\r\nplains of Central Asia a species of deer, known among the Tartars as\r\nSiaga, and to our own naturalists as the Tail-less Roe.  Several species\r\nentirely unknown to scientific men will yet be discovered, when the\r\nimmense steppes of Asia come to be explored by observers capable of\r\ndescribing and classifying.\r\n\r\nLike many another genus of animals, a complete monograph of the deer\r\ntribe would be of itself the labour of a life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nQUADRUPEDS WITH POCKETS.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1711 was brought to France, from the Island of New Guinea,\r\nan animal of an unknown species, and one that was singular in many\r\nrespects; but especially so, from the fact of its having a double skin,\r\ncovering a part of its belly, and forming a sort of pocket or pouch.\r\nThis animal was Le Brun\'s Kangaroo; very properly named after the\r\nnaturalist who first described it, since it was the first of the\r\nmarsupial or pouched animals known to the scientific world.\r\n\r\nThe Opossums of America were afterwards scientifically described; but it\r\nis only of late years that the numerous species and genera of pouched\r\nanimals--constituting almost the entire mammalia of the Australian\r\nworld--have become generally known to Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the _pouched_ animals is in reality the _pouch_,\r\ncommon to all of them.  Otherwise they differ in many respects--some\r\nbeing carnivorous, others graminivorous, others insectivorous, and so\r\non.  In fact, among them we have forms analogous to almost all the\r\ndifferent groups of ordinary mammalia.  Some naturalists have even\r\nclassified them in the different groups, but with little success; and it\r\nis perhaps better to keep them together, retaining the "pouch" as the\r\ncommon characteristic.\r\n\r\nThe marsupial animals bring forth their young before they are fully\r\ndeveloped.  The mother places the mouth, of what is little more than a\r\nfoetus, to her teat; and there it remains till it is able to go alone.\r\nThe pouch covers the teats, and serves to protect the young, while the\r\nprocess of development is going on.  Even after the little ones are able\r\nto run about, they continue to use this singular nest as a place of\r\nrepose, and a refuge in case of attack by an enemy!\r\n\r\nThe pouched animals are not entirely confined to the Australian island.\r\nThe large island of New Guinea possesses some of them; and there are\r\nspecies in Java, and others of the Asiatic islands.  America (both North\r\nand South) has the opossums, in numerous species; but it is in\r\nAustralia, and the contiguous islands of Van Diemen\'s Land and New\r\nGuinea, that we find both the genera and species in greatest numbers.\r\nThese countries are, in fact, the head-quarters of the marsupial\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe true genera are not numerous, though the species of most of them\r\nare; and it is but natural to suppose that many new ones--both genera\r\nand species--will yet be discovered, when the vast _terra incognita_ of\r\nAustralia comes to be explored.  In fact, every expedition into the\r\ninterior brings home with it some new animal that carries a pouch!\r\n\r\nAs the opossums were the first of these animals whose habits became\r\ngenerally known to Europeans, we shall speak first of them; and it may\r\nbe remarked, that although there are several species in the Australian\r\ncountries resembling the true opossums, and are even called opossums,\r\nyet among naturalists the name is usually limited to the pouched animals\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nThe old writer, Lawson, gives as succinct an account of the habits of\r\nthe best known species--the Virginia opossum--as may be found anywhere.\r\nWe shall adopt it _verbatim_:--"The possum," says he, "is found nowhere\r\nbut in America.  She is the wonder of all the land animals--being of the\r\nsize of a badger, and near that colour.  The female, doubtless, breeds\r\nher young at her teats, for I have seen them stuck fast thereto when\r\nthey have been no bigger than a small raspberry, and seemingly\r\ninanimate.  She has a paunch, or false belly, wherein she carries her\r\nyoung, after they are from those teats, till they can shift for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n"Their food is roots, poultry, or wild fruits.  They have no hair on\r\ntheir tails, but a sort of scale or hard crust, as the beavers have.  If\r\na cat has nine lives, this creature surely has nineteen; for if you\r\nbreak every bone in their skin, and smash their skull, leaving them\r\nquite dead, you may come an hour after and they will be quite gone away,\r\nor, perhaps, you may meet them creeping away.  They are a very stupid\r\ncreature, utterly neglecting their safety.  They are most like rats than\r\nanything.  I have for necessity, in the wilderness, eaten of them.\r\nTheir flesh is very white and well-tasted, but their ugly tails put me\r\nout of conceit with that fare.  They climb trees as the racoons do.\r\nTheir fur is not esteemed or used, save that the Indians spin it into\r\ngirdles and gaiters."\r\n\r\nBating the exaggeration about their tenacity of life, and also the error\r\nas to their mode of bringing forth, the above account hits off the\r\nopossum to a nicety.  Lawson might have added that their tails are\r\nhighly prehensile, and are not only used for suspending them to the\r\nbranches of trees, but also employed by the female for holding her young\r\nupon her back--in which fashion she often carries them about.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the opossum is not only eatable, but much eaten, and even\r\nsought after as a delicacy both by negroes and whites.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how the number of species of this animal has lately\r\nmultiplied, under the research of naturalists.  Perhaps no creature\r\nillustrates more forcibly the folly of setting limits to the species of\r\nanimals, by simply trusting to the account of those known or described.\r\nOver thirty species have been found in America, of which five or six\r\nbelong to the northern division of the continent.  The tropical region\r\nis their head-quarters; but they are not confined to the torrid zone,\r\nsince there are species existing everywhere, from Canada to Chili.\r\n\r\nAnother form of pouched animal that can scarcely be called an opossum is\r\nthe Yapock of tropical South America.  It is a smaller animal than the\r\nopossum, aquatic in its habits, and in fact approaches nearer to the\r\nfamily of the water-rats.  Of this, too, there are several species.\r\n\r\nCrossing to Australia we find the pouched animals, as already observed,\r\nof several different and very dissimilar genera.\r\n\r\nTaking them in the usual order of mammalia, we have three kinds truly\r\ncarnivorous.  First, the Tasmanian wolf, a creature which possesses all\r\nthe fierce attributes of his synonyme, and is, in fact, a wolf, only one\r\nwho carries a pocket.  He is an animal as active as fierce, and lives by\r\npreying on the kangaroos and other kindred animals.  He is also\r\ntroublesome to the breeders of sheep; as, since the introduction of\r\nthese innocent animals to his country, he appears to have formed a\r\npreference for mutton over kangaroo flesh.  Fortunately his range is not\r\nextensive, as he is confined to the island of Van Dieman\'s Land, and has\r\nnot been observed elsewhere.  Only one species has been yet discovered.\r\n\r\nAnother pouched animal, equally carnivorous, is the Ursine Opossum.\r\nThis is a burrowing creature about the size of a badger, and of equally\r\nvoracious habits.\r\n\r\nIn some places it proves extremely destructive to the poultry of the\r\nsettler, though it will also eat carcass, or dead fish--in short,\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nIn a state of captivity it will not submit to be tamed, biting\r\neverything that comes near it, at the same time uttering a sort of\r\nyelling growl.  Small though it be, in many of its actions and habits it\r\nresembles the bear, and might be regarded as the Australian\r\nrepresentative of the ursine family; but several of its species approach\r\nnearer to the weasels--for it is not so poor in species as the Tasmanian\r\nwolf, there being at least five kinds of it in Australia and Van\r\nDieman\'s Land.  One variety of it is distinguished by the name of Native\r\nDevil!\r\n\r\nAnother genus of Australian _carnivora_ is in the Phascogals.  These\r\nanimals are smaller than the last, and dwell upon trees like squirrels.\r\nFrom their having bushy tails, they might readily be mistaken for\r\nanimals of the squirrel kind; but their habits are entirely different--\r\nsince to birds, and other small game, they are as destructive as the\r\nweasel itself.\r\n\r\nAfter the true carnivora come the Bandicoots.  These are named after the\r\ngreat bandicoot rat of India, to which the early settlers fancied they\r\nbore a resemblance.  They are insect-eaters, and represent in Australia\r\nthe shrews and tenrecs of the Old World.  They also feed upon roots and\r\nbulbs, which with their strong claws they are enabled to scratch up out\r\nof the ground.  Their mode of progression is by leaps--not like those of\r\nthe kangaroo, but still more resembling the pace of a rabbit or hare--\r\nand they appear to prefer mountainous regions for their habitat.  There\r\nare several species of them in Australia and the adjacent islands.\r\n\r\nThe Phalangers, or Fox Opossums, come next in order.  These creatures\r\nare so called from a sort of resemblance which they bear to the\r\nwell-known Reynard; but, fortunately, the resemblance does not extend to\r\ntheir habits, as they are all supposed to be innocent creatures, living\r\non fruits and seeds, and climbing trees for the purpose of obtaining\r\nthem.  The true Vulpine Opossum--which is a native of Australia, near\r\nPort Jackson--is very much like a small fox; but there are two\r\nsub-genera of the phalangers that differ much from this form.  One of\r\nthese is the Scham-scham, a very beautiful spotted creature found in the\r\nMolucca and Papuan islands.  Several other species of phalangers inhabit\r\nthese and other Asiatic islands, especially Celebes and New Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe other sub-genus is that of the Flying Squirrels, usually known as\r\nNorfolk Island Flying Squirrels, though it is not even certain that they\r\ninhabit the last-mentioned island.  It needs only to be said that these\r\nanimals are very much like other flying squirrels; and in fact they\r\n_are_ squirrels, only squirrels of the marsupial kind.  There are\r\nseveral species already described.\r\n\r\nAnother pouched animal is the Koala, or Ashy Koala as it is called.  It\r\ndiffers in appearance from all the others, being of stout make, and\r\nalmost without a tail.  It is not unlike the bear in its form and\r\nmovements; but its bulk is scarce equal to that of a moderate sized dog.\r\nIt can climb trees with great facility, though it makes its lodgment\r\namong their roots, in a den which it hollows out for itself.  Its food\r\nis supposed to be fruits, and very likely it is the Australian\r\nrepresentative of the _frugivorous_ bears.  It has the singular habit of\r\ncarrying its young one upon its back, after the latter has grown too\r\nlarge to be conveniently stowed away in the pouch.  Two species of koala\r\nhave been spoken of, but as yet one only is described and certainly\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe Wombat is another animal of thick stout form, and also without tail.\r\nIt is a slow creature, easily overtaken by a man on foot.  It burrows\r\nin the ground.  During the day it remains in its hole, issuing forth\r\nonly at night to procure its food, which consists mainly of herbage.\r\nThere is but one species known, belonging to both Van Dieman\'s Land and\r\nNew South Wales.\r\n\r\nI have kept the Kangaroos to the last: not that they are the least\r\ninteresting, but because these very singular animals are now so\r\nwell-known, and their habits have been so often described, that it seems\r\nalmost superfluous to say a word about them.  I shall content myself\r\nwith observing that the genus of the kangaroos has been divided into two\r\nsub-genera, the true Kangaroos, and those known as Kangaroo Rats.  The\r\ndifference, however, is not very great, since the rats are as mild and\r\ninoffensive in their habits as the kangaroos themselves.  Of the\r\nkangaroo rats there are several species; but when we arrive at the true\r\nkangaroos we find a list altogether too numerous to mention.  They are\r\nof all sizes, too, from that of the great giant kangaroo, that stands,\r\nor rather squats, full five feet in height, down to little tiny\r\ncreatures not bigger than rabbits or squirrels.  There are nearly fifty\r\nspecies in all inhabiting the known parts of the Australasian islands.\r\nIt may be remarked, in conclusion, that two or three other kinds of\r\npouched animals, differing from all the foregoing, have been lately\r\nbrought to light by recent explorers; but, since nothing certain has\r\nbeen ascertained in regard to their habits, it would be idle in this\r\nplace even to mention their names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nANT-EATERS, ARMADILLOES, AND OTHER ODD ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThis is, perhaps, the most interesting of the groups--interesting on\r\naccount of the singular animals which compose it, every one of which may\r\nbe termed an odd creature.  In a strictly natural classification these\r\nanimals would not come together, since many of the species are unlike\r\nthe others both in appearance and habits; but in a scientific point of\r\nview the absence of incisor teeth has caused them to be ranged together\r\nin a group, known as the _edentata_, or toothless animals.\r\n\r\nIn this group we shall give the first place to the true ant-eaters, and\r\nfirst speak of the ant-eaters of America.  Of these there are four\r\nwell-known species, the great Ant-bear, or Tamanoir; the Tamandua, or\r\nlittle Ant-bear; another little ant-bear, the Ringed Tamandua; and a\r\nvery small species that differs much from the other three.  They are all\r\ninhabitants of tropical America, and there are varieties of them in\r\ndifferent districts.\r\n\r\nThe Tamanoir is by far the largest, often attaining the size of a\r\nNewfoundland dog; and the long hair which covers its sides, together\r\nwith its immense bushy tail, give to it the appearance of being much\r\nbulkier than it is.\r\n\r\nIts habits are tolerably well-known, constituting a very curious chapter\r\nin natural history which we have not space to give.  Suffice it to say\r\nthat its food consists entirely of ants and termites, which of\r\nthemselves form a strange feature in the zoology of tropical countries.\r\nThese it eats--not with teeth, but by means of its long slimy tongue, by\r\nwhich it is enabled to draw into its mouth hundreds of the little\r\ncreatures at a time.\r\n\r\nThe two species of smaller ant-bears, or Tamanduas, obtain their\r\nsustenance in a similar manner, and in other respects are like their\r\ngreat congener; but they possess a power with which the latter is not\r\ngifted--that of climbing trees, and making their nests high up in the\r\ncavities of the trunks.  They have the further power of being able to\r\nsuspend themselves from the branches with their tails, which, like those\r\nof the opossums, are highly prehensile.  The tamanduas do not live\r\nsolely upon ant-diet.  The wild bees, that build nests among the\r\nbranches, are also objects of their attention; and their thick hairy\r\nskins appear to protect them from the stings of these insects.\r\n\r\nThe smallest species--called the Ouatiri, or Two-toed Ant-eater--differs\r\naltogether from the three above-mentioned.  It more resembles a little\r\nmonkey, and is covered all over with a thick coat of soft woolly hair of\r\na yellowish colour.  It is also a tree-climber, possesses a naked\r\nprehensile tail, and makes its nest in a hole in the trunk, or in one of\r\nthe larger branches.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the ant-eaters are represented by several kinds of animals,\r\ndiffering essentially from each other in outward appearance, though all\r\nagreeing in their habits, or rather in the nature of their food.\r\n\r\nThe Aard-vark, or Earth-hog, of the Cape colonists, is the most noted\r\nkind.  This animal is a long, low-bodied creature, with sharp-pointed\r\nsnout, and an immense whip-like tongue, which he is capable of\r\nprojecting to a great distance, in the same manner as the tamanoir.  His\r\nbody is covered with a dense shock of reddish-brown hair; and he dwells\r\nin a burrow, which he can cleverly make for himself--hence his trivial\r\nname of Ground-hog.\r\n\r\nThe other African ant-eaters are usually called Pangolins, or Manis.\r\nThese are covered with scales that resemble suits of ancient armour; and\r\non this account they have sometimes been confounded with the\r\narmadilloes, though the two kinds of creatures are altogether different\r\nin their habits.  The pangolins possess, in common with the armadilloes,\r\nthe power of rolling themselves into a ball whenever attacked by an\r\nenemy--a fashion not peculiar to pangolins and armadilloes, but also\r\npractised by our own well-known hedgehog.\r\n\r\nThe Sloths belong to this group of mammalia; not that they have the\r\nslightest resemblance to the ant-eaters in any respect, but simply, as\r\nbefore stated, because they want the cutting teeth.  They are not\r\nabsolutely toothless, however, since they possess both canines and\r\nmolars.  With these they are enabled to masticate their food, which\r\nconsists of the leaves and tender shoots of trees.\r\n\r\nThe name, _sloth_, is derived from the sluggishness of their movements,\r\namounting almost to complete inactivity.  They scarce stir from the spot\r\nin which they may be placed, or at all events move so slowly as to be a\r\nwhole hour in getting from one tree to another, or even from one limb to\r\nanother!  They spend most part of their time upon the trees (the\r\n_cecropia peltata_ is their favourite), usually clinging to the branches\r\nwith their backs downward; and in this way they crawl from one to\r\nanother, uttering at intervals a plaintive cry, which resembles the\r\nsyllable _ai_, uttered several times in succession.  From this they\r\nderive one of their trivial names of Ai, or Ay-ay.\r\n\r\nThe sloths are all inhabitants of tropical America--dwellers in the\r\ngreat forests of Guiana and Brazil.\r\n\r\nAs natural curiosities in the animal kingdom, the Armadilloes do not\r\nyield to any of the four-footed creatures, and an account of their\r\nhabits, would space permit, could not be otherwise than extremely\r\ninteresting.  They are exclusively inhabitants of America; but many\r\nspecies, both in North and South America, are found far beyond the\r\nlimits of the torrid zone.  There are a great many species known--and\r\nthese are of all sizes--from that of an ordinary rat, to the Giant\r\nTatou, which sometimes attains the enormous dimensions of a moderate\r\nsized sheep!  It may be mentioned that they are subdivided into a number\r\nof genera, as the sloths, etcetera; and here, again, without any very\r\nsufficient reason, since they all possess the scaly armour--from which\r\nthe name armadillo is derived--and their habits are nearly identical.\r\nThey dwell in burrows, which they make for themselves; in fact, they are\r\nmore than ordinarily clever at excavating, and have been blamed for\r\ncarrying their tunnels into graveyards, and feeding upon the bodies\r\nthere deposited!  Of some of the species this charge is but too true;\r\nand one would think that an animal of such habit would be regarded with\r\ndisgust.  On the contrary, the flesh of the armadillo is in much esteem\r\nas an article of food, both among the white colonists and the natives,\r\nand men and dogs are employed in many parts of South America to procure\r\nit for the table.  Several species of armadilloes possess the power of\r\nclueing themselves up, _a la hedgehog_, and thus presenting an\r\nimpenetrable front to the attacks of an enemy; while others want this\r\npower, but, in its stead, can flatten their bodies along the ground, in\r\nsuch a way that neither dog nor jaguar can set tooth upon anything\r\nsofter than their scales, and these are as impenetrable as if they were\r\nplates of steel.\r\n\r\nThe more noted species are known by different names--as the Tatou Poyou,\r\nthe Giant Tatou, the Peba, the Pichiciago, the Pichey, the Hairy Tatou,\r\nthe Mataco, the Apara, and such like designations.\r\n\r\nIt may be added, that the armadilloes dwell in districts very\r\ndissimilar.  According to the species, they inhabit low marshes, thick\r\nforests, or dry open hills; and several kinds are indigenous to the high\r\ntable-lands of the Andes.\r\n\r\nTheir usual food consists of fruits, legumes, and roots; but they are\r\nnearly all omnivorous, and will eat carrion whenever it falls in their\r\nway.\r\n\r\nTo this group belong two very singular animals, that have only of late\r\nyears become known.  These are the Mullingong--better known as the\r\nOrnithoryncus--and the Echidna, or Ant-eating Hedgehog.  Both are\r\nnatives of what may be termed the new world of Australasia.\r\n\r\nTo give an account of the peculiar conformation or appearance of the\r\nmullingong would require many pages, and only the artist can convey any\r\nidea of what the creature is like.  Suffice it to say, that it is a sort\r\nof triangular cross between a bird, a quadruped, and a fish; having the\r\nbill of a duck, the hair, skin, and legs of a quadruped, and the aquatic\r\nhabits of a fish, or rather of a seal.  In general appearance it is,\r\nperhaps, more like to a beaver than to any other animal.  It dwells upon\r\nthe banks of rivers, lakes, or marshes, burrows in the ground like a\r\nbadger, swims and dives well, and feeds chiefly on aquatic insects.\r\n\r\nThe echidna is altogether a different sort of creature, both in\r\nappearance and habits.  It is, in reality, an ant-eater, with the body\r\nof a porcupine, having a long slender snout and an extensile tongue,\r\njust like that of other ant-eaters.  It burrows in the ground, where it\r\ncan remain for a long period without food, and it is supposed to issue\r\nforth only during the season of the rains.  It also possesses the power\r\nof rolling itself into a ball, like the hedgehog--hence its name among\r\nthe colonists of Ant-eating Hedgehog; but by far the most appropriate\r\nappellation for it is the Porcupine Ant-eater, since in general\r\nappearance it is exceedingly like several species of porcupines.\r\n\r\nThe Porcupines and Hedgehogs, though usually classed elsewhere, on\r\naccount of their teeth, their food, and a few other reasons not very\r\nnatural, should certainly stand in this group of odd animals; and here\r\nlet us place them.  We have not space to say much about either of them;\r\nand can only remark of the porcupines, that there are nearly a dozen\r\nknown species inhabiting different parts of the world--as usual,\r\nseparated into a great number of genera.  Europe, Asia, Africa, the\r\nAsiatic Islands, North and South America, all have their porcupines--\r\nsome of them entirely covered with quills, others with hair intermingled\r\nwith the spines, and still others on which the spinous processes are so\r\nsmall as to be scarcely perceptible, yet all partaking of the habits and\r\ncharacter of the true porcupines.  It may be further remarked, that the\r\nAmerican porcupines are tree-climbers, and feed upon twigs and bark; in\r\nfact, lead a life very much resembling that of the sloths.\r\n\r\nThe Hedgehogs, about which so much has been said, should also go with\r\nthis group, though it is usual to place them among carnivorous animals.\r\n\r\nOf hedgehogs there are also several species, and they are found in most\r\ncountries of Europe, and in many parts of Asia and Africa.  No true\r\nhedgehog has yet been discovered in North or South America, but they\r\nhave their representatives there in other species of worm-eating\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIt would not be proper to conclude these sketches without remarking,\r\nthat there are still a few other odd animals which we have not an\r\nopportunity of introducing here.  As an instance, we may mention the\r\nlittle Daman, or Hyrax, a native of Africa and Asia Minor, and of which\r\nthere are two or three distinct species.  This is the animal over which\r\nMr Frederic Cuvier, and other learned anatomists, have raised such a\r\npaean of triumph--having discovered that, notwithstanding its great\r\nresemblance to a rabbit, the little creature was, in reality, a\r\n_rhinoceros_!\r\n\r\nM. Cuvier and his followers seem to have omitted the reflection that\r\nthis wonderful discovery very naturally suggests.  Putting it\r\ninterrogatively, we may ask, How is it that the hyrax, whose "anatomical\r\nstructure proves it to be a rhinoceros," is _not_ a rhinoceros in\r\nhabits, appearance, nor, in fact, in anything but the shape of its\r\nbones?\r\n\r\nIf, then, we were to take osteology for our guide, I fear we should\r\noften arrive at very erroneous conclusions; and were the little hyrax an\r\nextinct animal, and not known to us by actual observation, we should be\r\nled by anatomical theorists to ascribe to the timid creature a very\r\ndifferent set of manners from what it has got.\r\n\r\nDespite anatomic theories, then, we shall continue to regard the hyrax--\r\nthe coney of the Scriptures--as a _rabbit, and not a rhinoceros_!\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Quadrupeds, What They Are and Where\r\nFound, by Mayne Reid\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK QUADRUPEDS, WHAT THEY ARE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 23576.txt or 23576.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/5/7/23576/\r\n\r\nProduced by Nick Hodson of London, England\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
