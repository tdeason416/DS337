DALY_\r\n\r\n_As I write this dedication, dear Judge Daly, a flood of recollections\r\ncomes over me of unbroken friendship and great kindness on your part and\r\nthat of your wife, whose memory I venerate and cherish. This friendship\r\nhas never faltered for a moment, but has grown stronger and stronger as\r\nthe years have rolled by. Fortunate is the man who wins for himself two\r\nsuch friends! I have never ceased to remember the warm interest you and\r\nyour noble-hearted wife took from the first in my explorations in\r\nAfrica. I can only give you in return love and devotion for all the\r\nkindness I have experienced at your hands._\r\n\r\n                         _Your devoted friend,_\r\n\r\n                                        _PAUL DU CHAILLU._\r\n\r\n_September 1, 1899._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR YOUNG FOLKS:\r\n\r\nFriend Paul has led many of you into the great Equatorial Forest of\r\nAfrica. We met there many strange and wild tribes of men, and lived\r\namong cannibals and dwarfs or pygmies. We hunted together, and killed\r\nmany elephants, fierce gorillas, leopards, huge crocodiles, hippopotami,\r\nbuffalos, antelopes, strange-looking monkeys, wonderful chimpanzees of\r\ndifferent varieties,--some of them white, others yellow or black,--and\r\nmany other kinds of animals.\r\n\r\nIn this book I am going to take you to a very different part of the\r\nworld. I am going to lead you towards the far North, to "The Land of the\r\nLong Night,"--a land where during a part of the year the sun is not\r\nseen, for it does not rise above the horizon, and in some parts of the\r\ncountry does not show itself for sixty-seven days, during which time the\r\nmoon, stars, and the aurora borealis take its place.\r\n\r\n"The Land of the Long Night" is a land of darkness, of snow, of wind,\r\nand at times of intense cold; and we shall have a long journey before\r\nus, and shall have to change horses and vehicles at many post stations,\r\nand at those places we shall get meals and lodgings.\r\n\r\nWhen once in "The Land of the Long Night," we shall roam far and\r\nwide--east, west, north--over a vast trackless region, covered with deep\r\nsnow, drawn by reindeer instead of horses, and sometimes we shall walk\r\nor run with skees, which are the snowshoes of that country, and very\r\nunlike those used by our Indians.\r\n\r\nWe shall sleep on the snow in bags made of reindeer skins, follow the\r\nnomadic Laplander and his reindeer, live with him and sleep in his\r\n_k\xc3\xa5ta_ or tent. We shall hunt wolves, bears, and different kinds of\r\nfoxes and other animals, and sail and fish on the stormy Arctic seas.\r\n\r\nWe shall have plenty of fun, in spite of the snow, the terrific wind,\r\nand the cold we shall encounter; and, thanks to the houses of refuge\r\nwhich we shall find in our times of peril, we shall not perish in these\r\nArctic regions. But woe to the man who wanders in that far northern land\r\nwithout a guide or without knowing where these houses or farms of refuge\r\nare to be found, for he will surely succumb in some one of the storms\r\nthat are certain to overtake him.\r\n\r\nWe shall cross the Swedish and Norwegian mountains of the far North,\r\nwhich rise to a height of several thousand feet, and come to the\r\ndesolate shores of the Arctic Ocean, and there live among the people.\r\n\r\nIn a sunny room at the Marlborough in Broadway I have written this book.\r\nIt is a dear little room, made bright at night with electric lights, and\r\nfull of delightful reminiscences of cheerful evenings with friends, all\r\nkinds of knick-knacks, tin horns, "booby" prizes, mugs, etc.,--souvenirs\r\nof frolics at which I have had fine times. My two windows look out on\r\nthe roof of a church; it is all I can see; the noise of a wheel never\r\nreaches my ears. It is an ideal room to write books in.\r\n\r\nI am surrounded by pictures of boys and girls, and many older friends;\r\nthey look down upon me and cheer me, and when I write they all seem to\r\nsay, "Go on, Paul," and at other times, they cry, "Stop, Paul, you have\r\nwritten enough to-day; go and take a walk, go and see people and life,\r\ndine with friends; you will work much better to-morrow. \'All work and no\r\nplay makes Jack a dull boy.\' We shall be here to welcome you when you\r\ncome back."\r\n\r\nHow good it is to have friends, no matter how humble some of them are. I\r\nlove them all. No one ever has too many friends, and life without them\r\nis not worth having.\r\n\r\nNow, as I am ready to lay down my pen, I draw a long breath--"The Land\r\nof the Long Night" is ready for the printer. I am just thinking: all my\r\nbooks have been published in New York, and all but two have been\r\nwritten, in the dear old city.\r\n\r\n                         Your friend,\r\n\r\n                                        PAUL DU CHAILLU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter                                                            Page\r\n\r\n I.

I had\r\nreached that part of the highway overlooking the narrow part of the\r\nSound which separates Sweden from Denmark, and had just left the pretty\r\nlittle city of Helsingborg, and was looking at the hundreds of vessels\r\nand steamers which were moving towards the Baltic or coming out of that\r\nsea. It was a most beautiful sight.\r\n\r\nI intended to follow the road as far north as it went, and enter "The\r\nLand of the Long Night" when the sun was below the horizon for many\r\nweeks. I had plenty of time to spare, for it was the beginning of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nOn that day my horse was trotting at the usual gait of post-horses,\r\ngoing at the rate of six or seven miles an hour. He knew every stone,\r\nditch, bridge, and house on the road, for many and many a time the dear\r\nold animal had made this journey to and fro, often twice each way in a\r\nday. He had been a post-horse for over twelve years.\r\n\r\nHis master, my driver, was very kind to him. He always alighted when\r\nthere was a hill to ascend, and walked by his side, gently urging him to\r\ngo on. When the top of the hill was reached, he stopped to give the\r\nanimal time to take breath; then, before starting again, he would give\r\nhim a piece or two of black bread, sometimes a potato, which he had put\r\nin his pocket before leaving. The people of Scandinavia are always kind\r\nto their dumb animals. Believe me, dear young folks, there is something\r\nmean and cowardly about a man who is not kind to dumb creatures. Do not\r\nhave him for a friend!\r\n\r\nAs I looked at the ships sailing from the Baltic, a sudden yearning to\r\ngo home took hold of me, and I forgot all about "The Land of the Long\r\nNight." I thought of all my dear friends, of all the school girls and\r\nboys whom I knew, and I wanted to see them ever so much, even if it\r\nmight be only for a day. It would have made me so happy to look upon\r\ntheir faces once more. Sometimes one feels very lonely when away from\r\nhome, and that day I could not help it. I thought of dear Jeannie, of\r\nsweet Gertrude, and Hilda, of Marie, of Pauline, of Helen, of Laura, of\r\nBlanche, of Julia, of Melissa, of Rowena, of Beatrice, of Alice, of\r\nMaude, of Ethel, of Evelyn, of Louise, of Iphigenia, and others that\r\nwere also dear to me. Then I thought of Charles, of Arthur, of William,\r\nof Louis, of John, of Robert, of Frank, of George, of Anson, of\r\nMortimer, of Eddy, of Fred, and of many others.\r\n\r\nMany of the girls and boys call me either "Paul," "Friend Paul," or\r\n"Uncle Paul;" some of the girls call me "Cousin Paul." These are my\r\nchums, and it is lovely to have chums! I thought of the fun and good\r\ntimes I had had with all of them; and I felt on that day that I loved\r\nthem more than ever as the great ocean separated us.\r\n\r\nI thought of all the young folks whom I had talked to in the public or\r\nprivate schools in many of the States,--for if there is a thing Friend\r\nPaul likes, it is to talk to the young folks at school. As I thought of\r\nthis, it seemed as if I could see them listening to me.\r\n\r\nI suddenly became very homesick. I said to myself: "I will go to America\r\nand see my dear friends, and then return to go to \'The Land of the Long\r\nNight.\'" I could cross the Sound, go to Copenhagen,--the city was almost\r\nin sight, and a nice city it is,--and take one of the comfortable\r\nsteamers of the Thingvalla Line, now called Scandinavian-American Line,\r\nfor New York.\r\n\r\nAs I was thinking of this, it suddenly seemed to me that I heard voices\r\ncoming across the Atlantic,--voices from friends, from school girls and\r\nboys, calling: "Friend Paul, go on, go on to \'The Land of the Long\r\nNight\' first, and then come and tell us how it is there. Be of good\r\ncheer; no harm will befall you; you will be all right."\r\n\r\nFriend Paul cheered up when in imagination he had heard the voices of\r\nhis young friends urging him to go on, and he answered back: "Girls and\r\nboys, you are right. I am going to \'The Land of the Long Night\' first,\r\nand on my return I will tell you all that I have seen there."\r\n\r\nThe dear old horse did not know what I was thinking, and was trotting\r\nalong--until suddenly he made a sharp turn and entered the post station,\r\nthe end of his journey. There I changed horse and vehicle, took some\r\nrefreshment, and started again. During the afternoon, I came to the town\r\nof Landskrona. There, looking towards the Sound, I saw a steamer of the\r\nThingvalla Line gliding over the sea on its way to New York, and I said\r\naloud, "Steamer, you are not going to take me home this time. I am going\r\nto \'The Land of the Long Night\' first, to the land of snow and of gales,\r\nthe land of the bear, of the wolf, of the fox, and of the ermine.\r\nGood-bye, good-bye, dear steamer! I hope you will have a successful\r\npassage, and also that you have on board many Scandinavians going to our\r\nshores to make their home with us."\r\n\r\nI thought I again heard the same voices as before cry in response, "Good\r\nfor you, Paul, good for you!"\r\n\r\nI felt now that I was a different man. It was as if I had actually heard\r\nthe voices of the dear young people encouraging me to go forward. I\r\nsuddenly became very restless and full of energy. I wanted my horse to\r\ngo faster. The young folks wished me to go to "The Land of the Long\r\nNight." To that country I should go.\r\n\r\nFrom that day I was ready for any amount of hardships, of bumping and\r\nknocking about in sleighs. I did not care if my ears and nose were\r\nfrozen. All I wanted was to go ahead as fast as I could until I reached\r\n"The Land of the Long Night."\r\n\r\nI was in splendid condition for the journey. I had been roughing it all\r\nsummer in the mountain fastnesses of Norway. I had been living on cream,\r\nbutter, cheese, and milk, and had had bacon twice a week, on Sundays and\r\nWednesdays.\r\n\r\nThere were about one hundred and forty or fifty post stations before I\r\nreached Haparanda, the most northern town on the Gulf of Bothnia.\r\n\r\nEvery day\'s travel brought me nearer to "The Land of the Long Night,"\r\nbut it was still a very long way off. I had yet to sleep at many post\r\nstations and to change horses and vehicles many times.\r\n\r\nI entered and left many towns--Malm\xc3\xb6, Skan\xc3\xb6r, Falsterb\xc3\xb6,\r\nTrelleborg,--these last three were quaint, and the most southern towns\r\nin Sweden. How charming, clean, and neat are those little Swedish towns!\r\nI wished I could have tarried in some of them. Then I made a sweep\r\neastward, following the coast, and passed the town of Ystad, and then I\r\ngradually drove northward, for now the road skirted the shores of the\r\nBaltic. I passed Cimbrishamn, S\xc3\xb6lvesberg, Carlshamn, and Carlskrona.\r\n\r\nFrom Carlskrona the country was very pretty, and on my way to Kalmar,\r\nand further north, I could see the Island of \xc3\x96land with its numerous\r\nwindmills.\r\n\r\nThe continuous driving, often in vehicles without springs, was rather\r\nhard on my trousers, and I had not many pairs with me. In a word my\r\noutfit was very modest. To travel comfortably, one must have as little\r\nbaggage as possible; for if you have too much baggage it is as if you\r\nwere dragging a heavy log behind you; you are not your own master, all\r\nkinds of difficulties come in the way, and you have become the slave of\r\nyour own baggage. I bought clothing as I went along. I wished I could\r\nhave found some trousers lined with leather, like those used by cavalry\r\nsoldiers and by men who ride much on horseback; these would have lasted\r\na long time.\r\n\r\nThe weather was getting colder every day, winter was coming, and we had\r\nhad a few falls of snow. I passed Oscarshamn and Westervik, and at last\r\nabout the middle of November I arrived in Stockholm. But I had yet to\r\ntravel more than nine hundred miles to the north before I came to the\r\nsouthern border of "The Land of the Long Night."\r\n\r\nI had to give up my New York overcoat for warmer clothing and get a new\r\nwinter outfit. I bought a long, loose overcoat coming down to my feet.\r\nIt was lined throughout with thick, hairy wolf skin, which is said by\r\nthe people of the far North to be the warmest lining after the skin of\r\nthe reindeer. I also purchased big top-boots lined inside with furry\r\nwolf skin, and a round beaver cap with a border which, when turned down,\r\nprotected my ears and came to my eyes. I had besides a big, heavy hood,\r\nlined with fur, to be used when it was very cold. I had a pair of\r\nleather mittens lined inside with fur (mittens keep one\'s hands much\r\nwarmer than gloves, because they are not so tight and they do not impede\r\nthe circulation of the blood). The collar of my coat rose above my head\r\nand almost hid my face, and when I wore my hood only my eyes could be\r\nseen. In this winter costume I could drive all day long without feeling\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nFrom Stockholm I drove to Upsala by road--for I did not care for railway\r\ntravelling--changing horse and vehicle at every post station. When I\r\nreached Gefle winter had come on in earnest. Now all the houses in the\r\nhamlets and towns which I passed had double windows, and at the bottom,\r\nbetween the two, a layer of cotton was spread to absorb the moisture.\r\nInstead of sliding sashes, French windows opening like doors are used,\r\nand one of the panes of each is free for ventilation. The rooms were\r\nuncarpeted, just as in summer, but rugs were spread on the floors.\r\n\r\nAs I drove along it was pleasant to see at the windows, behind the panes\r\nof glass, pots filled with roses, carnations, geraniums, and other\r\nplants, all bending in the direction of the sun. The sun gave scarcely\r\nany heat, yet all the plants in a room liked to look towards the light.\r\n\r\nI was always so glad at the end of the day\'s travelling to rest at a\r\npost station, to enter the "stuga," the every-day room, where the family\r\nlives, and see the blazing open fireplace. How nice it was to jump into\r\na feather bed, and sink deep and be lost in it, and to cover myself with\r\na quilt filled with feathers or eider down!\r\n\r\nWhen I found a pleasant station I would remain there a day or two to\r\nrest, for it was hard to drive day after day, for ten, twelve, or\r\nfifteen, and sometimes eighteen hours. It was interesting to see the\r\nwhole family at their daily occupations; to see the women spin, weave,\r\nor knit; to see the men make skees, wooden shoes, etc., and the girls\r\nand boys go to school and have fun and play together, throwing snowballs\r\nat each other; making snow forts and defending them against other girls\r\nand boys that came to attack them. I wished sometimes to join in the\r\nfray, for I love fun.\r\n\r\nThe snow was deep, and the snow-ploughs, drawn by three horses, were\r\nseen pretty often on the road. The streets in the little hamlets or\r\ntowns were often blocked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "On the road were many snow-ploughs at work levelling the\r\nsnow."]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n SNOW LAND.--A GREAT SNOWSTORM.--FEARFUL ROADS.--SNOW-PLOUGHS.--LOSING\r\n     THE WAY.--INTELLIGENCE OF THE HORSES.--UPSET IN THE SNOW.--DIFFICULTY\r\n     OF RIGHTING OURSELVES.--PERSPIRING AT 23 DEGREES BELOW ZERO.--HOUSES\r\n     BURIED IN SNOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter I left the town of Gefle the blue sky became obscured by clouds, a\r\nfew flakes of snow began to fall, then more and more came down, and soon\r\nthey covered the old snow, that was already of good depth.\r\n\r\nI had never before had a post-horse that went so fast, and I wondered\r\nwhy. The horse knew, but I did not: a big snowstorm was coming! He was\r\nafraid of being caught in it, and wanted to reach his stable in time.\r\nAfter a while the snow fell so thick that I could see nothing ahead. To\r\nmake things worse it began to blow hard. Then I dropped the reins and\r\nlet the horse go as he pleased. As he knew that the snowstorm was\r\ncoming, so he would know how to get home. Suddenly he gave three or four\r\nloud neighs; this announced his arrival. Then he turned to the right and\r\nentered a yard. He had reached home!\r\n\r\nThe next morning it was still snowing; nevertheless I started. On the\r\nroad were many snow-ploughs at work levelling the snow. These ploughs\r\nwere of triangular form, made of heavy timber braced with crossbeams.\r\nThey were generally from eight to ten feet in width at the back, which\r\nwas the broadest part, and above fifteen feet long. They were drawn by\r\nfour horses and attended by two men.\r\n\r\nThe ploughs were followed by heavy rollers of wood to pack the snow.\r\n\r\nErik, my driver, said that every farmer is obliged to furnish horses to\r\nclear the road and level it after a snowstorm. The number of horses he\r\nfurnishes is regulated by the size of his farm. It is very important\r\nthat the road should be kept in good order, and the rules are strictly\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nAs we travelled along the road, it was amusing to see horses and dogs\r\nroll in the snow; they enjoyed it! The horses that we drove would often\r\ntake a nip of the snow, and the dogs that followed us did likewise.\r\n\r\nOne day when I was looking at two horses rolling in the snow near a\r\nfarmhouse, I suddenly felt a great jerk and we were pitched out\r\nheadlong! Our horse wanted to have some fun! So he fell on his side and\r\nwas about to roll over and enjoy himself, taking the sleigh with him;\r\nbut we did not see the joke. We succeeded in putting him on his legs.\r\nThe driver gave the animal a good scolding: "Shame on you, shame on\r\nyou!" he said to him. The horse listened, and seemed to understand him.\r\nI think he felt ashamed.\r\n\r\nAs I journeyed further north the snow got deeper and deeper every hour.\r\nSnow-ploughs were now drawn by five horses and generally attended by\r\nthree men.\r\n\r\nThe snowstorm still continued. It had now lasted over four days, and\r\nwith no appearance of holding up. The wind at times blew very hard.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the snowstorm I continued to travel, and had passed the\r\ntowns of S\xc3\xb6derhamn, Hudicksvall, Sundsvall, and Hern\xc3\xb6sand, with their\r\nstreets deep in snow. On the fifth day we had great difficulty in\r\ngetting along. In some places the ploughs had not passed over the road\r\nsince two days before, for we were now going through a very sparsely\r\ninhabited country. Some parts of the road were honeycombed with holes\r\nabout fifteen inches deep, made in this way: each horse that had passed\r\nstepped in the tracks of the one that had preceded him, and made the\r\nholes deeper and deeper, which made walking very difficult for the poor\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe further north I went the deeper became the snow, and travelling\r\nbecame tedious. Our sleigh tumbled on one side or the other, upsetting\r\nbefore we could say "Boo!" At each effort the poor horse made to\r\nextricate himself, we had either to get out of the sleigh or be thrown\r\nout. The poor brute would often sink to his neck, and sometimes almost\r\nto his head when he got out of the snow-plough\'s track! In order to make\r\nsome headway and to make up for the slowness of the horses and bad\r\nroads, I travelled sixteen and eighteen hours a day, and when I came to\r\na post station I was pretty tired.\r\n\r\nThe ploughs I now met were drawn by six horses and attended by four or\r\nfive men. The struggles of the poor animals as they sank continually in\r\nthe deep soft snow and tried to extricate themselves, were sometimes\r\npainful to behold.\r\n\r\nWe always had to be careful to drive in the middle of the road, where\r\nthe snow had been cleared and packed by the snow-ploughs and the\r\nrollers. Sometimes we could not tell where it was, for the land around\r\nwas deeply buried and the track of the snow-ploughs was hidden by the\r\nfresh-fallen snow.\r\n\r\nWhen my driver made a mistake and drove one way or the other outside of\r\nthe track, the first intimation we had was that of the horse sinking\r\nsuddenly, being ourselves upset or nearly so. Then we had a lot of\r\ntrouble putting him on the track again.\r\n\r\nAfter several of these mishaps, the driver would say to me: "Now I am\r\ngoing to let the horse go by himself. He is accustomed every year to go\r\nin deep snow on this road and he will know the way." "You are right," I\r\nwould reply.\r\n\r\nWhen let alone the horse would walk very slowly, and he would hesitate\r\neach time he put either his right or his left foot on the snow, to make\r\nsure he was on the right track. If he thought he was on the left of the\r\nroad, it was his left foot that came down first; if he thought he was to\r\nthe right of the road, he put his right foot down, but not until he had\r\nmade sure that he was right. If he saw that he had made a mistake, he\r\nturned quickly to one side or the other.\r\n\r\nOne day the horse suddenly dropped one leg in the soft snow, on the\r\nright side of the track; this unbalanced him and--bang! he fell on his\r\nside, taking the sleigh with him. We were pitched out, and as we got up\r\non our legs we found ourselves in snow up to our necks. Only after\r\nfrantic efforts did the horse succeed in regaining his footing.\r\n\r\nAs I looked around and saw our situation, and that our three heads were\r\njust above the snow, with the horse\'s head looking at us, his eyes\r\nseeming to say, "Are you not going to help me out of this?" I gave a\r\ngreat shout of laughter, for the sight was so funny that I forgot being\r\npitched out--and I said to the driver, "Don\'t we look funny, the horse\r\nincluded, with only our heads and shoulders above the snow!"\r\n\r\nWhat a job we had to extricate ourselves, put the poor horse on the\r\ntrack again, and afterwards right the sleigh. Then we found that the\r\nharness was broken in several places, and we had to mend it the best way\r\nwe could with numb fingers. I had stopped laughing, for there was no fun\r\nin that.\r\n\r\n"At this rate of travelling," I said to the driver, "it will take a\r\nwhole day to go three or four miles. I do not know whether our poor\r\nhorse will be able to stand it. Look at him! He looks as if he were a\r\nsmoke-stack, so much steam is rising from his body. He may become so\r\nexhausted that he will not be able to go further, and we shall have to\r\nabandon the sleigh."\r\n\r\n"It is so," coolly replied Lars the driver, and he remained silent\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nI felt sorry for the poor horse, and reproached myself for not having\r\ntarried at the last post station.\r\n\r\nThen I said to Lars, "If the horse gives out, we will try to build a\r\nsnow house for us three. You have some hay, and he will not starve. As\r\nfor ourselves, we will try to reach some farm and get some food and some\r\noats for our poor dear horse. I am very sorry we have no skees with us."\r\n\r\nThere was so much snow over the land that I thought I had come to "Snow\r\nLand." It was over twelve feet in depth; it had been snowing for six\r\nconsecutive days and nights, and it was snowing yet. I was now between\r\nthe sixty-third and sixty-fourth degrees of north latitude, and I had to\r\ntravel on the road nearly two hundred miles more before I came to the\r\nsouthern part of "The Land of the Long Night." The little town of Ume\xc3\xa5\r\nfor which I was bound was still far away. I said to myself, "I have to\r\ncross this \'Snow Land\' before I reach \'The Land of the Long Night.\' What\r\nhard work it will be!"\r\n\r\nA little further on we came to the post station--and how glad I was to\r\nspend the night there--to get into a feather bed. The following day the\r\nsnow-ploughs and the rollers were busy, and the centre of the highway\r\nwas made passable for some miles further north. So bidding good-bye to\r\nthe station master and to my driver of the day before, I started with a\r\nfine young horse and a strong young fellow for a driver.\r\n\r\nAs I looked around, I could see snow, snow, deep snow everywhere. The\r\nfences, the stone walls of the scattered farms, and the huge boulders\r\nwith which that part of the country is covered were buried out of sight;\r\nonly the tops of the birches and of the fir and pine trees could be\r\nseen. I had not met such deep snow before! I had never encountered such\r\na continuous snowstorm! "Surely," I said to myself again, as I looked\r\nover the country, "this is \'Snow Land.\'" I wondered how long it would\r\ntake to cross it. The snow was nearly fourteen feet deep on a level.\r\n\r\nI next came to a part of the country where thousands of branches of pine\r\nand fir trees had been planted in two rows to show the line of the road.\r\nI could not tell now when I was travelling over a river, a lake, on\r\nland, or over the frozen Gulf of Bothnia!\r\n\r\nAs we were passing over one of the barren districts, a swamp in summer,\r\nfull of stones and boulders, without a house in sight, I said to my\r\ndriver: "When are we coming to the next farm?"\r\n\r\n"At the rate we are going," he replied, "it will take us two hours at\r\nleast."\r\n\r\n"Then let us stop and give a little of the hay you have brought with you\r\nto the horse. After he has rested a while, we will start again."\r\n\r\nAfter the horse had eaten his hay, we started. We had not gone long,\r\nhowever, before we were upset. The horse had not kept to the road. We\r\nhad a hard time to right the sleigh and bring the horse back to firm\r\nsnow. It was such hard work that the perspiration was dripping from our\r\nfaces, though it was 23 degrees below zero.\r\n\r\n"I have had enough of this travelling," I said to the driver; "the snow\r\nis too deep and soft to go on. The snow-ploughs have not done much good\r\nhere. They evidently could not go far."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe," he replied, "that horses will be given to you at the\r\nnext post station, even if we should reach there to-day. But I am sure\r\nwe cannot do it, and we shall have to stop at the first farm we meet and\r\nask the farmer for shelter until people can travel on the road again."\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterwards I saw in the distance a little hamlet, or a number\r\nof farms close together. What a sight! Many of the small houses were\r\nburied in the snow, and only their roofs or chimneys could be seen. From\r\nsome of the chimneys smoke was curling upwards. I was delighted.\r\n\r\nEvery one was busy digging and making trenches, so that the light and\r\nair might reach the windows, or that communication could be had between\r\nthe buildings, especially those where the animals were housed. In some\r\ncases the exit had first to be made through the chimney.\r\n\r\nIt was a very strange sight indeed! and I said to myself, "Surely I am\r\nin \'Snow Land.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n HALT AT A FARMHOUSE.--MADE WELCOME.--A STRANGE-LOOKING INTERIOR.--QUEER\r\n     BEDS.--SNOWED IN.--EXIT THROUGH THE CHIMNEY.--CLEARING PATHS.--I\r\n     RESUME MY JOURNEY.--REACH HAPARANDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after we stopped at one of these farms. A trench about fifteen feet\r\ndeep had been made, leading to the door of the dwelling-house. Here\r\nlived friends of my driver. I alighted and walked through the narrow\r\ntrench and opened the storm door. In the little hall hung long coats\r\nlined with woolly sheepskin; on the floor were wooden shoes, shovels,\r\naxes, etc. A ladder stood upright against the wall.\r\n\r\nI opened the other door. As I entered I found myself in a large room. I\r\nsaluted the farmer and family. They all looked at me with astonishment,\r\nfor I was not one of the neighbors, and who could I be!\r\n\r\nThe farmer said: "What are you doing, stranger, on the highroad with\r\nsnow so deep, and when travelling is suspended, snow-ploughs abandoned,\r\nhorses belonging to them gone to the nearest farms? You cannot go\r\nfurther until the snow packs itself with its own weight, and the\r\nsnow-ploughs and rollers are able to work on the road. Did you come here\r\non skees?"\r\n\r\n"No, I drove," I replied.\r\n\r\n"Where is your horse?"\r\n\r\n"At the gate," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I am going north as far as the extremity of Northern Europe. I want to\r\nbe in that land during the time of \'The Long Night,\' when no sun is to\r\nbe seen for weeks; but I am afraid I cannot travel further for a few\r\ndays on account of the deep snow, and I shall have to wait; and as we\r\ncannot go further and reach the post station, I come to ask you if you\r\ncan give shelter to a stranger far from his country."\r\n\r\n"You are welcome," he replied; and his wife added, "We are poor people,\r\nwe have a humble home, for our farm is small, but you will have the best\r\nwe have."\r\n\r\n"I thank you ever so much," I replied.\r\n\r\nThe farmer put more wood on the fire, the sticks being placed upright,\r\nin which manner they throw out much more heat, and a sudden blaze filled\r\nthe room with a bright glow.\r\n\r\nI like these farmers\' fireplaces. They are always built of masonry in\r\none of the corners of the room. The platform is about one foot above the\r\nfloor and generally four or five feet square, with a crane to hang\r\nkettles or cooking pots on; and when only the embers remain a trap in\r\nthe chimney is closed, to prevent the heat from getting out.\r\n\r\nThe wife put the coffee kettle over the fire, and one of the daughters\r\nkept herself busy with the coffee mill.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time my driver came in and was welcomed, and they asked him\r\nabout me. When they heard I was from America they shouted, "From\r\nAmerica!" and when they had recovered from their astonishment, the\r\nhusband said, "I have a brother in America." The wife said, "I have a\r\nsister and two nieces in America," and tears came into her eyes. They\r\ndid also into mine; there was at once a bond of union between us. To\r\nthem the United States was so far away, and I was so far from home. They\r\noften thought of their folks and friends who had emigrated to our land.\r\n\r\nThe family was composed of three daughters and two sons. The girls had\r\nfair hair and large blue eyes, and were strong enough to be victorious\r\nin a wrestling contest with big boys.\r\n\r\nThe sons helped their father on the farm. The names of the girls were:\r\nEngla Matilda, Serlotta Maria, and Kajsa Maria; the mother Lovisa\r\nKristina; the father Carl; the sons were Nils and Erik.\r\n\r\nThe big room was strange-looking. In one corner was the large open\r\nfireplace. A large hand loom, with an unfinished piece of thick coarse\r\nwoollen stuff or cloth which was being woven, was in another corner.\r\nNear by were three spinning-wheels; upon one was flax and on the two\r\nothers wool. On the walls were shelves for plates, saucers, glasses,\r\nmugs, dishes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling was about eight or nine feet in height. There was an opening\r\nin it which was accessible by a ladder. I wanted very much to know what\r\nthere was above. Along the walls were several wooden benches like\r\nsofas, upon which the people sat. A large wooden table with wooden\r\nbenches and two or three wooden chairs completed the furniture. There\r\nwas a trap-door in the middle of the floor, leading into the cellar; and\r\nas this never froze, the potatoes and other vegetables, the butter and\r\ncheese, and ale were kept there.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the living-room were two doors leading to two small\r\nrooms. One had shelves for pails containing milk and the churn to make\r\nbutter with. In the other room were a number of painted chests, with the\r\ninitials of the owners upon them, and lots of dresses hanging along the\r\nwalls, and a bed.\r\n\r\nThe husband suddenly disappeared through the trap-door and soon came\r\nback with potatoes and a big piece of bacon. The sight roused my\r\nappetite. The potatoes were washed and boiled, and the pan was put over\r\nthe fire and the bacon cut into slices and fried.\r\n\r\nThe meal was put on a very clean table without tablecloth, and then the\r\ndriver and I were bidden to sit down and eat. Our coffee cups were\r\nfilled to the brim, and every two or three minutes we were urged to eat\r\nmore, to drink more coffee. How good were the potatoes! How good were\r\nthe bacon and the cheese and the butter! I thought that that meal tasted\r\nbetter than any I had eaten in my life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "The husband suddenly disappeared through the trap-door\r\nand soon came back with potatoes and a big piece of bacon."]\r\n\r\nWhen we stopped, for we had eaten to our hearts\' content, with one voice\r\nhusband and wife said: "Eat more, eat more;" and before I knew it, our\r\ntwo cups were filled for the third time, and more potatoes and bacon\r\nwere put on our plates. They all seemed so happy to see us eat with such\r\nan appetite.\r\n\r\nThe dear farmers of Norway and Sweden were always so hospitable and kind\r\nto me. Do not wonder that I love them. No one in these countries has\r\never tried to do me harm or ever robbed me of a penny.\r\n\r\nAfter our meal we stretched our legs before the open fireplace. I was\r\nmore happy than if I had been in a splendid palace. I forgot the snow\r\nand storm. How nice it was to be in front of a fireplace when the storm\r\nwas raging!\r\n\r\nThe farmer put more sticks on the fire. The room was in a perfect blaze\r\nof light. Gradually the fire died out, and when there were only embers\r\nleft he stirred them with the poker until not a particle of flame\r\nappeared, and when there was no danger of fumes he shut the trap so that\r\nno heat would escape through the chimney. The time of going to bed had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nI was wondering all the time where we were all going to sleep, for there\r\nwere no beds in sight. "Perhaps," said I to myself, "we are all going up\r\nthe ladder to sleep upstairs. Perhaps we are going to sleep on the\r\nfloor." But I did not see any mattress, sheepskins, or home-made woollen\r\nblankets anywhere--and these when together would have made a big pile.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I saw the daughters come to the bench-like sofas and pull out\r\na drawer out of each sofa. These were to be the beds. They were filled\r\nwith hay, with two sheepskins on the top to be used as sheets and\r\nblankets.\r\n\r\nThese sliding boxes could be made of different widths, according to the\r\nnumber of occupants that were to sleep in the same bed.\r\n\r\nI said to myself, "Strange-looking beds these," when one of the girls\r\nsaid, "Sometimes we can squeeze five or six into one of these beds." I\r\nwas glad I was not going to be the fifth or sixth, for we should have\r\nbeen packed like sardines or herring.\r\n\r\nWhen everything was ready the boys ascended the ladder and went to sleep\r\nupstairs. A bed was given me, and the rest of the family slept in their\r\nown, two girls sleeping in one bed. Then we bade each other good-night.\r\nHow warm and comfortable were my sheepskins!\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night I heard the howling of the wind; a terrific\r\ngale was blowing. How thankful I felt to be under shelter! Early in the\r\nmorning, while still in bed, I was startled by the shouts of one of the\r\nboys: "Father, we are snowed in! We cannot get out of the house!"\r\n\r\n"Are we snowed in?" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Yes," shouted the two boys at the same time. I jumped out of bed to\r\nfind out if it was a joke. It was true!\r\n\r\nThe boys were delighted, and said with great glee: "The wind has filled\r\nall the trenches with snow. We shall have to get out through the\r\nchimney. What fun that will be!"\r\n\r\nI thought also that it would be fun. I had never got out of a house\r\nthrough the chimney, and I was anxious now to do it, for I might never\r\nget another chance.\r\n\r\nEverybody was now out of bed. "It is good that the cellar is full of\r\npotatoes and that a sack of the Russian flour has not been touched, so\r\nwe have plenty of food," said the father. "Besides, there is bacon,\r\ncheese, and butter," said one of the girls. Another added, "We have\r\ninside firewood for three days without being obliged to go to the\r\nwoodshed."\r\n\r\nThe farmer said, "There has never been so much snow during living man\'s\r\nmemory. Old Pehr, my neighbor, whom I went to see yesterday, and who is\r\neighty-four years old, said that he never remembered such a snowstorm."\r\n\r\nI thought of the poor horse that had worked so hard to bring us here.\r\n"Boys, we must make the way clear to the stable and feed your horse and\r\nmine," I said. "Let us hurry and go out through the chimney."\r\n\r\n"They are all right," said the father; "I left so much fodder before\r\nthem that they will not starve even if we could not reach them to-day."\r\n\r\n"Dear horses, how useful to us," I said. "I often wonder that there are\r\nsome men so cruel and so hard-hearted as to beat the poor animals when\r\nthey have not strength enough to carry the heavy load put upon them, or\r\nto make them work when they are ill. It is a good thing that there are\r\nsocieties in many countries for the prevention of cruelty to horses and\r\nother animals."\r\n\r\n"It is so," said they all with one voice; "we do not know of any one\r\namong our neighbors who is unkind to his horse. We do not know what we\r\nshould do if our poor horse were ill."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said one of the girls, "when he was a colt our horse used to put\r\nhis head through the door to get pieces of potatoes and apples. We love\r\nhim!"\r\n\r\nThe ladder was fetched and put into the chimney. There was no trouble\r\nabout that, for the chimney was so wide. The shovels were brought in.\r\nThere were three of them. Then Nils ascended the ladder, and afterwards\r\ncrept to the top. This was a hard job. Erik followed, and succeeded also\r\nin reaching the roof. Then we heard voices coming down the chimney.\r\n\r\n"Father," called the boys, "tie the shovels to the cord we drop." They\r\nhad taken the precaution of carrying a cord with them. The shovels were\r\nhauled up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "The boys got hold of my hands and pulled me through."]\r\n\r\nThen my turn came to go through. I got into the chimney first, and saw\r\nthe faces of Nils and Erik peeping down. "It is all right. Come on, Herr\r\nPaul." I ascended the ladder, then crept up the rest of the chimney. The\r\nboys got hold of my hands and pulled me through. What a sight! I was\r\nblack with soot. Nils and Erik were likewise. We gave three great\r\nhurrahs. We shouted through the chimney to the folks with great glee,\r\n"Be patient, you will get out by and by."\r\n\r\nWe worked with a will, and succeeded in clearing the trench leading to\r\nthe door, and there was a great shout of joy when it opened. Then the\r\ngirls came out and joined us in making the way clear to the barn, to the\r\ntwo horses, five cows, and twelve sheep. When we opened the door of the\r\nbarn the horses neighed, the cows lowed, and the sheep baaed. It was a\r\nfine concert of voices. They were glad to see us. It was their way of\r\nbidding us welcome.\r\n\r\nReturning to the house we cleared the windows, then the well, of snow.\r\nThe well was surrounded by a mass of ice. We drew water and gave a good\r\ndrink to the horses and the other animals. The girls milked the cows,\r\nand gave fresh fodder to all.\r\n\r\nWhen our work was done we were all as hungry as the wolves are in\r\nwinter, when they have had no food for days.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the mother had prepared a big meal for us, and we\r\nentered the house. We were ready to do justice to the food. The potatoes\r\nand the bacon quickly disappeared. After the meal we cleared the other\r\nwindows of snow, and made passages to them, so that light might come\r\nthrough. It was a hard day\'s work all round!\r\n\r\nWhen supper time came we seated ourselves before a big wooden bowl of\r\nporridge called "gr\xc3\xb6d," made from barley meal. On each side were two\r\nwooden bowls filled with sour milk. We ate with wooden spoons from the\r\nsame dish. There were no plates for supper, and once in a while we took\r\na spoonful of sour milk to help the gr\xc3\xb6d go down. I always enjoy eating\r\nwith wooden or horn spoons.\r\n\r\nI went to sleep in the loft this time. I wanted to be near Nils and\r\nErik. They were fine boys, and we were friends. Did we not sleep well\r\nthat night! We did not awake until their father came to shake us.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing like shovelling snow to make one sleep," we all said,\r\nafter we awoke.\r\n\r\nThe next day the women were very busy a great part of the day. Engla\r\nspun flax on her spinning-wheel, Serlotta carded wool, and Maria wove a\r\nthick woollen cloth to be turned into garments for three new suits for\r\nher father and two brothers, while the mother knitted woollen stockings.\r\n\r\nI remained three days on this farm. During that time the snow had packed\r\nand the snow-ploughs followed by the rollers had made their reappearance\r\non the highroad. It was time for me to leave, for I was in a hurry, and\r\nI had to travel nearly nine hundred miles before I could reach Nordkyn.\r\n\r\nWhen I left I put some money into the hands of the wife, and when she\r\nfelt it in her hand she said, "No, no; to be paid for giving food and\r\nshelter to a person who is overtaken by a storm, is a shame. What would\r\nGod think of me for doing that? No, no;" she said again, with more\r\nearnestness.\r\n\r\nI succeeded at last, after much insistence, in overcoming her scruples\r\nand making her take it; and once more I was on the road leading\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nTravelling was still very difficult. I came late to a post station where\r\nI intended to spend the night, for I was very tired. The place was\r\nfilled with travellers and all the beds were taken. Men slept on\r\nbenches, on the top of the table, and on the floor. These were\r\ntravellers who had been detained on the road and were once more on their\r\nway southward.\r\n\r\nI saw a space on the floor between two men--just enough for me to get\r\nin--and I quietly stepped over three fellows who were fast asleep and\r\nmade for the empty place, and went to sleep in my fur coat.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I was once more on the long and tedious road leading\r\nnorth, towards "The Land of the Long Night." That afternoon I reached\r\nthe little town of Ume\xc3\xa5.\r\n\r\nThe days had become shorter and shorter. The sun was very low at noon\r\nand was not above the horizon more than one hour. As I travelled further\r\nnorth I was surprised to notice that the snow diminished rapidly. I had\r\nleft the great "Snow Land," or snow belt, which seemed to be between 62\r\nand 64 degrees north, behind me.\r\n\r\nAfter changing horses at several post stations I came to the little\r\ntowns of Skellefte\xc3\xa5, Pite\xc3\xa5, and Lule\xc3\xa5, and at last I reached Haparanda,\r\nsituated at the extreme northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia, at the\r\nmouth of the Torne river, the most northern town in Sweden.\r\n\r\nAt Haparanda I had driven about seven hundred and forty miles from\r\nStockholm, and over twenty-five hundred miles since I had left the\r\nmountains of Norway. I was only forty-one miles south of the Arctic\r\nCircle, which is the most southerly part of "The Land of the Long\r\nNight."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n GOOD ADVICE FROM THE PEOPLE OF HAPARANDA.--WARNED AGAINST STILL COLDER\r\n     WEATHER.--DIFFERENT COSTUME NEEDED.--DRESSED AS A LAPLANDER.--LAPP\r\n     GRASS FOR FEET PROTECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had hardly arrived in Haparanda, when the leading people of the place\r\ncame to welcome me. I was not unknown to several of them, on account of\r\nsome of my books which have been translated into Swedish; and they were\r\nmy friends at once.\r\n\r\nThey heard with astonishment that I intended to go further north. They\r\nlooked serious and remained silent for a while. "We will give you\r\nletters of introduction to our friends," they said; "but after a time\r\nyou will be too far north, where we do not know anybody. You will find\r\nonly Finlanders and Laplanders until you come to the Arctic shores of\r\nNorway."\r\n\r\nAfter saying this they began to fill their big meerschaum pipes with\r\ntobacco and lighted them, and smoke came out as if from a small funnel.\r\nThey gave puff after puff and were again silent; the wrinkles over their\r\nforeheads showed that they were thoughtful and anxious.\r\n\r\nOne friend said: "The country which lies between the head of the Gulf\r\nof Bothnia and Nordkyn, the most northern part of the mainland in\r\nEurope, is very stormy in winter, the winds blow with terrific force,\r\nand midway between the shores of the Baltic and the extremity of the\r\nland snow is also very deep. It is a roadless land."\r\n\r\nWhen I heard this, I said to myself: "Is \'The Land of the Long Night\'\r\n\'Snow Land\' as well?" Then I thought of the great "Snow Land" I had left\r\nbehind me, and how hard travelling had been, and I wondered if it would\r\nbe worse in this second "Snow Land." If it was, then I had a hard task\r\nahead of me.\r\n\r\nAnother friend said, "This big overcoat of yours will never do in the\r\ncountry you are going to. These long boots you wear will not be\r\nserviceable."\r\n\r\n"Yes," they all said together. "This costume of yours will be\r\nunmanageable on account of the wind. You cannot travel in \'The Land of\r\nthe Long Night\' dressed as you are. You must dress like a Laplander.\r\nTheirs is the only costume that can stand the weather you are to\r\nencounter, the only one in which you will be able to get into their\r\nsmall sleighs, and face the fierce wind and the intense cold."\r\n\r\n"Remember," said another of my new friends, "that you are going to\r\ntravel over a roadless country covered with snow, the reindeer will be\r\nyour horse, and you will not be able to go about without going on skees,\r\nfor at every step one sinks deep into the snow."\r\n\r\nThen another added, to reassure me: "Our country is a country of laws;\r\nwe have order, and hate lawlessness. You will feel safe among the\r\npeople. You will find where the country is uninhabited, or where the\r\nfarms are very wide apart, houses or farms of refuge where you can get\r\nfood and reindeer to take you further on. These are post stations where\r\nyou can remain until the weather is good. There you are as safe as among\r\nus."\r\n\r\nI thanked them for all the advice and information they gave me and said\r\nthat I would follow their admonition in regard to my dress. They then\r\nbade me good-night. The next day I remembered what my friends had said\r\nto me the day before, and with one of them I went to get the garments\r\nworn by the Lapps.\r\n\r\nI bought two "kaptor."[1] These are also called "pesh." They are long\r\nblouses reaching down to the knee or below, made of reindeer skins, with\r\nfur attached; with a narrow aperture for the head to pass through, and\r\nfitting closely round the neck.\r\n\r\n[1] Plural form. Singular, "kapta."\r\n\r\nOne of the kaptor was much larger than the other, for in case of intense\r\ncold one is worn beneath the other with the fur inside, and the outside\r\none with the fur outside.\r\n\r\nI got a pair of trousers made of skin from the legs of the reindeer, of\r\nwhich the fur though short is considered the warmest part of the animal,\r\nas it protects his legs, which are always in the snow. The provisions of\r\nnature are wonderful!\r\n\r\nThere are no openings to the Lapp trousers, so that no cold air can\r\nreach the body. They are fastened round the waist by a string and are\r\ntied above the ankle. There the fur is removed and the leather is made\r\nvery soft so that it may go round the shoe.\r\n\r\nI got two pairs of shoes made of the skin of the reindeer near the hoof,\r\nwith the fur outside. This part is said to be the warmest part of the\r\nwhole skin. All the Lapp shoes are sharp pointed, the point turning\r\nupward. They are bound at the seams with red flannel. The upper part\r\nfits above the ankle. They were large enough for me to wear two pairs of\r\nthick, home-knitted stockings and Lapp grass to surround the foot\r\neverywhere without pinching it. Long narrow bands of bright color are\r\nattached to them. These bands are wound around the legs above the\r\nankles, thus preventing snow and wind from penetrating. These shoes can\r\nonly be used in cold weather when the snow is crisp, and are especially\r\nadapted for skees, as they are pointed and have no heels.\r\n\r\nI procured also four pairs of mittens, one made of the skin of the\r\nreindeer near the hoof, another of wool with a sort of down, the third\r\nof cow\'s hair, and the fourth of goat\'s hair; the two latter are the\r\nwarmest, but they are very perishable.\r\n\r\nI also got two pairs of very thick home-knitted stockings. These were of\r\nwool. I succeeded in getting two other pairs made of cow\'s hair, and\r\nanother pair made of goat\'s hair, and I was especially cautioned to\r\nhandle them gently when I put them on or took them off--likewise with\r\nthe mittens of goat\'s and cow\'s hair.\r\n\r\nI also got a vest made of soft reindeer skin to put on over my\r\nunderwear, and two sets of thick underwear of homespun, for these are\r\nmuch warmer than those that are made by machinery.\r\n\r\nI added to my outfit one pair of long and another shorter pair of boots\r\nfor wet weather in the spring, when the snow is damp and watery. These\r\nboots were made of the skin of the lower part of the hind legs of\r\nreindeer, the fur being scraped off. The leather is black and it is\r\nprepared in such a way as to exclude water or moisture. They were rubbed\r\nwith a composition of reindeer fat and tar.\r\n\r\nThen I bought a square Lapp cap, the top filled with eider down. The rim\r\ncould be turned down to protect the ears and the forehead.\r\n\r\nAfter procuring my Lapp outfit, I thought I would try to dress myself in\r\nmy new garments. The friend who accompanied me said: "I will show you\r\nhow to prepare your feet before you put your shoes on. One can never be\r\ntoo careful, otherwise the feet are sure to be cold on a journey."\r\n\r\nI put on my two new pairs of hand-knitted stockings. He surrounded my\r\nfeet over the stockings with Lapp grass; then he put my shoe on most\r\ncarefully, with the lower part of the trousers inside, and then wound\r\nthe bands not too tight round my ankle, saying, "Now your feet will be\r\nwarm all day even if you spend all your time on skees. You see how\r\ncareful I have been in putting on your shoes. Dressed as you are you\r\ncan defy the cold. If you follow the advice I have given you, you will\r\nnever have cold feet no matter how long you drive or walk in the snow.\r\nBut take great care that neither shoes, nor stockings, nor grass be\r\ndamp. I think it will be well for you to let a Lapp or a Finn put your\r\nshoes on before you start on a long journey--until you can do it\r\nyourself quite well."\r\n\r\nThe "shoe grass" of which I have spoken grows in the Arctic regions in\r\npools in the summer. It is gathered in great quantity by the Laplanders\r\nand Finlanders, who dry it and keep it carefully, for it is\r\nindispensable in winter in their land of snow and cold. It has the\r\npeculiarity of retaining heat and keeping the feet warm and absorbing\r\nthe moisture. I always travelled with a good stock of that grass,\r\ntwisted and knotted together in small bundles.\r\n\r\nThen I looked at myself in the looking-glass, and for the first time saw\r\nhow I appeared in my new outfit, my Lapp costume. The frontispiece will\r\nshow you exactly how I was dressed (without a hood), for it is from a\r\nphotograph. Unfortunately, being a bachelor, I don\'t know how to take\r\ncare of things, and my costume, gloves, stockings, and mittens have been\r\neaten up by moths, and I have had to throw them away. But I appeared\r\nbefore the American Geographical Society in New York dressed in this\r\nsuit, seated in my Lapp sleigh, with a stuffed reindeer harnessed to it,\r\nand my bearskin over me.\r\n\r\nTo complete my outfit I added two large reindeer-skin bags, one larger,\r\nso that the smaller one could be put inside it without much difficulty.\r\nI was to sleep in these bags when obliged to rest out doors on the snow.\r\nOne bag was sufficient in ordinary cold weather--say 15 or 20 degrees\r\nbelow zero; the other I would use when the thermometer ranged from 25 to\r\n40 or 50 degrees below zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n WHAT THE ARCTIC CIRCLE IS.--DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON OF THE LONG\r\n     NIGHT.--REASONS FOR ITS EXISTENCE.--THE ECLIPTIC AND THE\r\n     EQUINOXES.--LENGTH OF THE LONG NIGHT AT DIFFERENT PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I was ready to go further northward beyond the Arctic Circle, and\r\nroam in "The Land of the Long Night."\r\n\r\nThe Arctic Circle is an imaginary line, just as are the Equator and the\r\ntwo Tropics, going round the earth, and begins at 66\xc2\xb0 32\' north latitude\r\nand is 1623 miles from the North Pole. It is the southernmost limit of\r\nthe region where the sun disappears in winter, under the horizon, for\r\none day.\r\n\r\nAt the North Pole on the 22nd of September the sun descends to the\r\nhorizon and then disappears till the 20th of March, when it reappears\r\nand remains in sight above the horizon until the 22nd of September. So\r\nat the pole the year is made of one day and one night. On the 22nd day\r\nof December it disappears at the Arctic Circle for one day only. The\r\nspace between the Arctic Circle and the pole is therefore called the\r\nArctic region, or the Frigid Zone. Consequently, the further one\r\nadvances to the north, the longer the duration of the night.\r\n\r\nI will tell you the causes of this phenomenon of the Long Night. The\r\nearth revolves about the sun once every year, and rotates on its axis\r\nonce in twenty-four hours, which makes what we call a day.\r\n\r\nRotate means to move round a centre; thus the daily turning of the earth\r\non its axis is a rotation. Its annual course round the sun is called a\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThe axis about which the daily rotation takes place is an imaginary\r\nstraight line passing through the centre of the earth, and its\r\nextremities are called poles, hence the names of the North and the South\r\npole. The diurnal movement is from West to East and takes place in\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe earth\'s orbit, or the path described by it in its annual revolution\r\nabout the sun, is, so to speak, a flattened circle, somewhat elongated,\r\ncalled an ellipse. The axis of the earth is not perpendicular to the\r\nplane of the orbit, which is an imaginary flat surface enclosed by the\r\nline of the earth\'s revolution, but is inclined to it at an angle of 23\xc2\xb0\r\n28\', which angle is called the obliquity of the ecliptic. The ecliptic\r\nis the path or way among the fixed stars which the earth in its orbit\r\nappears to describe to an eye placed in the sun, for the sun is the\r\nfixed centre and not the earth. The earth, therefore, in moving about\r\nthe sun, is not upright, but inclined, so that in different parts of its\r\ncourse it always presents a half, but always a different half, of its\r\nsurface to the sun.\r\n\r\nTwice in the year, 21st of March and 21st of September, the exact half\r\nof the earth along its axis is illuminated. On these dates, therefore,\r\nany point on the earth\'s surface is, during the rotation of the earth on\r\nits axis, half the time in light and half the time in darkness,--that\r\nis, day and night are twelve hours each all over the globe.\r\n\r\nThese two dates are called equinoxes, March 21st being the vernal, and\r\nSeptember 21st being the autumnal, equinox.\r\n\r\nAs the earth moves in its orbit after March 21st, the North Pole\r\ninclines more and more towards the sun, till June 21st, after which it\r\nturns away from it. On September 21st day and night are again equal all\r\nover the earth, and after this the North Pole is turned away from the\r\nsun, and does not receive its light again till the following March.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that from the autumnal to the vernal equinox the\r\nNorth Pole is in darkness and has a night of six months\' duration,\r\nduring which time the sun is not seen. Therefore, any point near the\r\npole is, during any given twenty-four hours, longer in darkness than in\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe number of days of constant darkness depends on the latitude of the\r\nobserver. At the pole the sun is not seen for six months, at the Arctic\r\nCircle it is invisible, as I have said, for only one day in December. At\r\nNorth Cape and Nordkyn the sun disappears November 18th, and is not seen\r\nagain till January 24th. That is the reason I have called the land\r\nbetween North Cape and the Arctic Circle "The Land of the Long Night."\r\n\r\nThis "Land of the Long Night" commences at Nordkyn, or the most northern\r\npoint of the continent of Europe,--or at North Cape, but five miles\r\ndistant--on the 16th of November. The whole sun appears on that day, its\r\nlower rim just touching above the horizon at noon. The next day, 17th of\r\nNovember, the lower half of the sun has disappeared, and the following\r\nday, the 18th, it sinks below the horizon and does not show itself again\r\nuntil the 24th of January--hence the night there lasts sixty-seven days\r\nof twenty-four hours each. And at the Arctic Circle the sun is only\r\ncompletely hidden on the 22nd of December.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows you the dates of the disappearance of the sun,\r\nand of its reappearance at the principal places to which we are going.\r\n\r\n              THE CONTINUOUS NIGHT\r\n\r\n _Where the sun is last seen, begins at:_\r\n\r\n         Karasjok              November 26th\r\n         Vard\xc3\xb6                          22nd\r\n         Hammerfest                     21st\r\n         North Cape or Nordkyn          18th\r\n\r\n _Where the sun is first seen again, begins at:_\r\n\r\n         Karasjok               January 16th\r\n         Vard\xc3\xb6                          20th\r\n         Hammerfest                     21st\r\n         North Cape or Nordkyn          24th\r\n\r\nI hope that I have been successful in giving you an idea of day and\r\nnight in the Frigid Zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n FINE WEATHER LEAVING HAPARANDA.--WINDSTORMS SUCCEED.--A FINLANDER\'S\r\n     FARM.--STRANGE FIREPLACE.--INTERIOR OF A COW-HOUSE.--QUEER FOOD\r\n     FOR CATTLE.--PASSING THE ARCTIC CIRCLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI left Haparanda in the beginning of January, surrounded by the friends\r\nwho had taken such an interest in me. The atmosphere was clear, and not\r\na cloud was to be seen in the pale blue sky, turning into greenish as it\r\napproached the horizon. There was not a breath of wind. Once the\r\nthermometer marked 30 degrees below zero.\r\n\r\n"Be careful," said my friends. "This is treacherous weather for ears and\r\nnoses, there is danger of their getting frozen; rub them, and also your\r\nface, now and then with snow. Keep your ears covered, and protect them\r\nwith your hood. If it becomes colder put on your mask."\r\n\r\nI thanked them for their kind advice, but replied: "No mask for me just\r\nnow, I want to breathe this pure invigorating air as much as I can. I\r\nwant it to reach my lungs."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "It was indeed, a fearful wind storm."]\r\n\r\n"Be careful in such weather," they repeated. "This is beautiful weather\r\nindeed, but sometimes it does not last long and is followed by furious\r\ngales, or great snowstorms; but we hope this fine weather will follow\r\nyou for many days. Often it lasts quite a while."\r\n\r\nThen we bade good-bye to each other. They tucked the sheepskin round me,\r\nand bade the driver to take good care of Paulus.\r\n\r\nSoon after this we were out of Haparanda and on the highroad leading to\r\nPajala, which was about one hundred and ten miles further north, there\r\nbeing ten or twelve post stations between the two places.\r\n\r\nSleighing was fine, the road had been used much, so we went on at a very\r\nfast pace. It was just the weather people, horses, dogs, and reindeer\r\nliked. I liked it also very much, for it was so exhilarating, and I felt\r\nso well and so strong. I was ready, nevertheless, for all kinds of\r\nweather, and I was fully prepared to meet great storms, for I wanted to\r\nencounter the blizzards of the Arctic regions just to find out how\r\nstrongly the wind could blow. I found out later!\r\n\r\nI changed horses at several post stations during the day, among them the\r\nstations of Korpikyla, Niemis, Ruskola, and Matarengi. I found that the\r\nFinnish language was now prevalent, Swedish being only spoken by\r\ncomparatively few people.\r\n\r\nThat day was the end of the fine weather. Towards evening the wind was\r\nblowing very hard, and it increased in strength every minute until it\r\nblew a perfect hurricane. Then what my friends had said to me came to\r\nmind. It was indeed a fearful windstorm!\r\n\r\nThe gale had become such that the horse at times did not seem to have\r\nstrength enough to pull our sleigh. The snow flew in thick cloudy masses\r\nto a great height, curling and recurling upon itself and blinding us.\r\nFortunately our robes were fastened very securely. I wore my hood, and\r\nit was so arranged that my eyes were the only part of my face that was\r\nnot covered. The wind was so powerful that our sleigh was in continual\r\ndanger of upsetting, and was only saved because it was so low.\r\n\r\nI was glad indeed when I reached the hamlet of Matarengi with its\r\nred-painted log church, two hundred years old, and separate belfry of\r\nthe same color.\r\n\r\nThe windstorm lasted three days. During that time I found that the\r\ntemperature varied from 8 to 22 degrees below zero.\r\n\r\nThen it became calm, the sky was perfectly clear, and the mercury marked\r\n40 degrees below zero. There was not a breath of wind. It was fine, and\r\nI made ready to continue my journey.\r\n\r\nWherever I changed horse and sleigh, before starting I shook hands with\r\nthe station master and his family, and after this bade good-bye to the\r\ndriver who had brought me to the place. One must not forget that little\r\npoliteness in these northern lands, otherwise the people would think you\r\nill-bred or proud and would dislike you. No man has ever made friends by\r\nbeing proud or conceited. It is, after all, very silly, and often very\r\nill-bred. I have found that one gets along much better in the world by\r\nbeing polite and obliging. It is so much easier to be pleasant than\r\nsour and gruff. In the former case you are happy; in the latter\r\ndiscontented and wretched. I always feel sorry when I meet people who\r\nare proud or conceited. Often I laugh at them in my sleeve, and when\r\nthat pride or conceit becomes overbearing I have great contempt for\r\nthem, and do not wish to have anything to do with them.\r\n\r\nI approached very fast the regions of "The Land of the Long Night." The\r\nroad was filled with freshly made, huge snowdrifts, which greatly\r\nimpeded our progress. Towards noon the wind increased again, and soon I\r\nwas in a worse gale than before. I said to myself, "Now I am indeed in\r\n\'The Land of the Wind.\'"\r\n\r\nSuddenly I saw dimly through the clouds of snow the dwellings of a farm.\r\n"Let us go there," I said to my driver, "for we cannot reach the post\r\nstation to-day." Our horse evidently thought as we did; he had made up\r\nhis mind to go no further, and preferred to be in a stable. He suddenly\r\nturned to the right, entered the yard, and stopped before the\r\ndwelling-house of the farm. I alighted. I was so dizzy from the effects\r\nof the wind that I could not walk straight, and tottered about for a\r\nminute or more. My driver was in the same condition.\r\n\r\nI entered the house and found myself in a large room, in the midst of a\r\nfamily of Finlanders, whose language is very unlike the Swedish or\r\nNorwegian. I was welcomed at once by all.\r\n\r\nI looked around, and saw a queer-looking structure, built of slabs of\r\nstone plastered over. It was about seven feet square, the inside\r\noven-like in shape. They were just lighting a fire; then the door was\r\nclosed. In one section of the structure was an open fireplace used for\r\ncooking.\r\n\r\nPoles were secured to the ceiling near the fireplace, upon which hung\r\ngarments,--stockings, shoes, boots, and other articles. In the middle of\r\nthe room was the usual trap-door leading into the cellar. There were two\r\nlarge hand looms upon which two girls were weaving. These two looms were\r\nvery old and had been several generations in the family. Three other\r\ngirls were occupied with wheels, spinning wool and flax.\r\n\r\nAlong the walls of this large room, which was about twenty feet square,\r\nwere a number of bench-like sofas, used for beds. Two or three wooden\r\nchairs, and a large wooden table surrounded by wooden benches, made up\r\nthe rest of the furniture.\r\n\r\nThe stove began to heat the room fearfully, for after the firewood had\r\nbeen reduced to charcoal, and the fumes from it were gone, the sliding\r\ntrap-door in the chimney had been closed, thus preventing the heat from\r\nescaping. The thick walls of the oven-like stove had been heated, and\r\nthrew out a great deal of heat, which to me soon became unbearable.\r\n\r\nThe farmer said to me that the walls would remain warm for two or three\r\ndays. The windows were all tight; none could be opened, and the only\r\nventilation came through the door when some one came in or went out.\r\n\r\nI went out and looked at the farm buildings while my sleigh was being\r\nmade ready. I was surprised to see the buildings of the farm and the big\r\ntimber of the log house, for I was so far north. The yard was enclosed\r\nby houses on three sides. The dwelling-house, the barn, and the\r\ncow-houses were the largest buildings. There were besides a blacksmith\r\nshop, a storehouse, and a shed for carts. All these buildings were\r\npainted red.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the yard was an old-fashioned well, with its sweep,\r\nhaving at one end a bucket and at the other a heavy stone, and\r\nsurrounded by a thick mass of ice. From the well there was a trough\r\ngoing into the cow-house, which I entered. The cattle were small and\r\nwell-shaped and in good order. The building was very low, the windows\r\nvery small and giving but little light. The floor was entirely planked\r\nover, and there were pens on each side.\r\n\r\nLooking towards the end of the building I saw a girl standing by a huge\r\niron pot, about four feet in diameter and three feet deep, encased in\r\nmasonry. She was putting coarse marsh grass into the pot, which was\r\nfilled with water made warm by a fire underneath. "Much of the grass we\r\ngather," said the farmer, "is coarse, and it is so tough that the cattle\r\ncannot eat it; so we have to prepare it in this way before we give it to\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nA number of sheep were penned in a corner. "Our three horses," said the\r\nfarmer, "have a stable for themselves." This farm was one of the good\r\nfarms, and there were a number quite as good. In some the dwellings are\r\nof two stories, but these were the great exception.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time supper had been prepared. Dry mutton as tough as\r\nleather but cut very thin, smoked reindeer meat, hard bread, butter,\r\ncheese, two wooden bowls of buttermilk, and fish were put on the table.\r\nThis was a great repast, in my honor. There was no tablecloth, no\r\nnapkin, no fork, the flat bread was used instead of plates, we had\r\nwooden spoons for the sour milk, and helped ourselves to it from the\r\ncommon dish.\r\n\r\nA little after supper came bedtime. The girls, looking at the clock,\r\nwhich marked nine, suddenly got up to make the beds ready. They pulled\r\nout the sliding boxes, in one of which three of them were to sleep. The\r\nboxes were filled with straw and hay, and had homespun blankets or\r\nsheepskins, and eider down or feather pillows. The sofa-like beds were\r\nall along the walls, for there was a large family.\r\n\r\nIt was well that I was at the farm. A more terrific windstorm than all\r\nthose I had seen before, arose during the night. In the morning the snow\r\nswirled to an immense height, hiding everything from sight; the whole\r\ncountry was enveloped in a thick cloud; the huge snowdrifts were carried\r\nhither and thither. The storm lasted two days, and after it was over the\r\nweather became calm, the temperature was 40\xc2\xb0 below zero, and when the\r\natmosphere was very clear we had about three or four hours of twilight.\r\n\r\nThen I bade farewell to the good farmer and his wife, and once more I\r\nwas on my way to "The Land of the Long Night," which was now very near.\r\n\r\nThe next day I came to a little lake the natives called Kunsijarvi, and\r\nfurther on I came to still another lake called Rukojarvi; and between\r\nthese two I had crossed the Arctic Circle. But it was January, the sun\r\nshowed itself above the horizon at noon. Near the shore of Lake\r\nRukojarvi was a solitary farm, where I stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n SKEES, OR THE QUEER SNOWSHOES OF THE NORTH.--HOW THEY ARE MADE.--LEARNING\r\n     TO USE THEM.--JOSEFF\'S INSTRUCTIONS.--HARD WORK AT FIRST.--GOING DOWN\r\n     HILL.--I BID JOSEFF GOOD-BYE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning Joseff, the owner of the farm, said to me: "Paulus,\r\nbefore you go further on your journey you must learn to go on skees;\r\notherwise you will not be able to travel, for the snow is very deep\r\nfurther north. I will teach you how to use skees, but in order to learn\r\nyou must remain with us for some time."\r\n\r\nThen pointing to the lake near by, he said, "This is the place where you\r\nare to learn. It will be easy for you to walk with them, for the surface\r\nof the lake is smooth and flat."\r\n\r\nAfter saying this, he went into one of the outer buildings of the farm\r\nand came out with several beautiful pairs of skees, and handed one of\r\nthem to me with these words: "I give them to you; when you wander\r\nfurther north and walk with them, think of me." I thanked Joseff for his\r\ngift and said: "I will always remember you, also your wife and your\r\nchildren, without these skees." Then looking at them, I added, "How\r\nbeautiful they are! How proud I shall be when I walk with them."\r\n\r\nThese skees, or snowshoes of northern Europe, are made of wood from the\r\nfir tree; at their thickest part, in the centre, they are between four\r\nand five inches in width. Here, where the foot rests, there is a piece\r\nof birch bark fastened, over which there is a loop, and through this\r\nloop the foot passes. That part of the skee under the foot is concave,\r\nand here it is thickest, so that where it supports the weight of the\r\nperson it cannot bend downward. The under part of the skee is grooved\r\nand polished, and soon becomes by use as smooth as glass. The forward\r\nend turns slightly upward, as you see by the pictures, so as to pass\r\nover the snow easily.\r\n\r\nJoseff left me, and soon came back with a good many more skees; some\r\nwere not more than six feet long; one pair was much longer than mine.\r\n\r\nAfter I had looked at them, he said, "The short ones are used in the\r\nforest, especially among the Lapps, where pine, fir, or birch trees are\r\nclose together, for there long skees cannot be used; but a heavily built\r\nman must have longer ones." Then pointing to the long pair, which were\r\nabout fourteen feet long, he said, "These long skees are used chiefly in\r\nthe province of Jemtland, which you passed on the shores of the Baltic\r\non your way here. The snow is generally very deep there, and after a\r\ngreat snow fall, when it is very soft, long skees are needed so that\r\nthey can bear up the weight of a man and not sink too deeply. Here we\r\nuse skees of about the size of the pair I gave you, sometimes a little\r\nlonger; but you are not a heavy man, so longer ones are not necessary\r\nfor you. They will be able to support your weight without going deeply\r\ninto the snow, even when it is soft."\r\n\r\nThen showing another pair, he said, "These have sealskin under them.\r\nThey are used in the spring when the snow is soft and becomes watery;\r\nthe skin prevents the snow from sticking to the skee."\r\n\r\nThe following morning we started with our skees for the lake, I carrying\r\nmine on my shoulders. When we reached the lake Joseff said, "Put your\r\nfeet under the loops, and you must manage to keep them there, just as\r\nyou would do if you had an old pair of slippers much too large for you.\r\nYou would have all the time to push your feet forward to keep them on.\r\nDo likewise with the skees. Your sharp-pointed Lapp shoes will help you\r\nto do this, as they somewhat prevent the slipping of the skee. It will\r\nbe a little difficult at first, but it will not take long for you to\r\nlearn to do this. Constant practice will be the best teacher, and you\r\nwill soon be able to walk with them."\r\n\r\nThen Joseff gave me two staves to propel myself with. At the end of each\r\nwas an iron spike, and above it a guard of wicker-work, about ten inches\r\nin diameter, to prevent the stick from sinking deeper. "These staves,"\r\nhe added, "are very useful when the snow is soft and the skees do not\r\nglide easily. Then propelling oneself with them makes one go faster.\r\nThough the snow is packed they will help you, as you are a beginner. The\r\nmost important point to learn is to keep the skees always parallel with\r\neach other; this is somewhat difficult at first. Never raise your feet\r\nor skees above the ground; make them glide on the snow; push one foot\r\nforward, then the other, just as when you walk."\r\n\r\nThen he got on his skees, and said: "Now, look at me and see how I go."\r\nI saw him gliding on the snow, pushing first one foot then the other,\r\nthe two skees running parallel with each other; and when one had a\r\ntendency to go inside or outside, he corrected the deviation at once by\r\na slight movement of his leg and foot. I noticed afterward that with\r\nmany persons the ankle was very flexible, owing to their going so much\r\non skees.\r\n\r\nAfter going some distance he returned to me, and we started slowly\r\ntogether. I pushed first one foot then the other forward, and tried to\r\ndo exactly what he had told me to do; but before I knew it the end of\r\none skee overlapped the other and stopped my advance at once.\r\nFortunately I was going slowly, otherwise I should have landed on the\r\nsnow. "The overlapping of one skee over the other is quite common with a\r\nbeginner," said my teacher to me.\r\n\r\nPutting my skees in position again, we started. This time one of my\r\nskees left me. Several times the two left me, and I found myself seated\r\non the snow every time. I made slow progress that day. At the end of the\r\nlesson Joseff said, "Do not be discouraged, Paulus, you will soon learn\r\nthe knack. I will now show you how fast a man can go on skees. Look at\r\nme." Then he started; he seemed simply to fly over the snow, and before\r\nmany minutes he was far away, almost out of sight. He was going at the\r\nrate of at least twenty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nI said to myself: "O Paul, when will you go as fast as Joseff!" I was\r\nfilled with ambition. I wanted to learn as fast as I could, and I\r\nthought I would take lessons every day.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned the perspiration was dripping from his face, though the\r\ncold was 39 degrees below zero.\r\n\r\nI spent several hours every day on the lake, learning and practising,\r\nand when Joseff had time he would come with me; and after three days I\r\nwas able to manage the skees tolerably well. I kept them in line and\r\nthey did not slip out from my feet any more. I could go several thousand\r\nyards without stopping and with no mishaps.\r\n\r\nAfter I could do this, Joseff said to me: "Paulus, you know now how to\r\ngo well on skees upon level land; now you must learn how to go down hill\r\nwith them. This is difficult, and I do not know whether in one winter\r\nyou can learn how to do it--at least so as to go down the slopes of\r\nmountains; one has to have learned that in boyhood--but I will teach you\r\nanyhow to go down hill safely."\r\n\r\nWe left the farm and went on with our skees until we came to the foot of\r\na pretty steep hill. Then Joseff said: "We will stop here, and I will\r\nteach you to go down hill."\r\n\r\nI noticed that he said this with a roguish eye, which was full of fun,\r\nand I began to suspect that things were not to go as smoothly as when I\r\nwas taught on the lake. "We cannot ascend this steep hill straight\r\nforward, for the skees would slip backward. We must ascend in zigzag,"\r\nsaid Joseff; and then with his staff he showed me how we were to go.\r\n"Follow my furrow, then it will be easier for you," said he. I found it\r\nhard enough, and slow work. When we reached the top of the hill we were\r\nvery warm, though that day it was 32 degrees below zero. I was wet with\r\nperspiration.\r\n\r\nAfter a rest, Joseff said: "Paulus, look at me." Straightening his skees\r\nand armed with his staff he leaned his body forward, and down he went,\r\nfaster than boys coasting down a very steep hill at home. It was fine,\r\nand I wished I could learn quickly and go down hill as fast as he did.\r\n\r\nWhen he had ascended the hill again, Joseff said to me: "Now, Paulus,\r\nget ready." He saw that my skees were in position, and saying, "Bend\r\nyour body far forward as you go down," he shouted "Go!" At this word I\r\nbent my body forward as he had told me, and down I went; but I got\r\nscared, as I was going very fast, and forgot to follow his advice;\r\nstraightened myself and bent backward, and before I knew it my skees\r\nslipped from my feet. I was unskeed just like a man who is unhorsed, and\r\nwas seated on the snow looking at my skees, which were going forward\r\ndown the steep hill and only stopped at its base, to the great\r\namusement of Joseff, who evidently expected something of the kind. "The\r\ntendency of a beginner," he explained, "is to bend backward, thinking\r\nthat by doing so he will be able not to go so fast; this invariably\r\nbrings about the same result, and he falls."\r\n\r\nAfter a good laugh from both of us, Joseff said: "Paulus, try again; but\r\nthis time I will teach you to go down hill in another way." He gave me\r\nhis big stick, and said, "Ride this, and rest upon it as heavily as you\r\ncan, so that a great part of your weight shall be on the end that sinks\r\ninto the snow, and before you start let the stick be in the snow about\r\nthree inches deep. Thus you will be prevented from going down too fast.\r\nDon\'t forget to start with your skees running straight along side of\r\neach other." I went down riding the stick, and reached the bottom of the\r\nhill in safety. I felt very proud of my success, but thought that if I\r\ncould ever do this like Joseff how happy I should be.\r\n\r\nThen Joseff gave me another warning. "Paulus," said he, "people must\r\nlook out carefully not to run into boulders as they go down hill, and a\r\nhill full of boulders only those who can guide their skees well can\r\nventure to go down. Avoid such hills when you are further north, for\r\notherwise you might even be killed."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Paulus, try again!"]\r\n\r\nShortly after our return to the farm the wind began again to rise, and\r\nanother terrific windstorm blew over the land. The hillocks of snow were\r\nswept from where they stood and new hillocks were made in other\r\nplaces. When I went out the wind almost took me off my feet.\r\n\r\nI found that my friends in Haparanda were right. The Lapp costume is\r\nwell adapted for cold weather. Nothing is warmer than reindeer skin, and\r\nit is convenient either when the wearer is driving in his Lapp sleigh,\r\nwalking or travelling on skees, or when breasting violent windstorms.\r\n\r\nI finally bade good-bye to Joseff, and thanked him for having taught me\r\nto go on skees. And I continued my journey northward, with a guide to\r\nshow me the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n A PRIMITIVE STEAM BATH HOUSE.--HOW THE BATH WAS PREPARED.--WHAT ARE THE\r\n     TWIGS FOR?--I ASCERTAIN.--ROLLING IN THE SNOW.--FINE EFFECT OF THE\r\n     BATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few miles further on I came to a little hamlet composed of a few\r\nfarms. The inhabitants were all Finlanders. Travelling was so bad, on\r\naccount of the big drifts of snow, that I decided to stay a few days in\r\nthe place. The following day was Saturday and the afternoon was the\r\nbeginning of Sunday, and the boys and the young men of the place said to\r\nme: "Paulus, to-day is bathing day. Every Saturday we have a bath."\r\n\r\n"All right, boys," I replied, "I will have a bath with you." Of course\r\nthey did not mean a water bath, but a steam bath.\r\n\r\nPointing to a little log building, they said, "Paulus, this is the bath\r\nhouse. Come, and we will show you how we work out a steam bath in our\r\ncountry. You see the bath house stands away from other buildings, to\r\nprevent the fire from spreading in case it should start anywhere."\r\n\r\nSo I went with them to the bath house and got in. It was dark, and no\r\nlight or air could come in except through the door. The room was about\r\nfifteen to eighteen feet long and about ten or twelve feet wide. In the\r\ncentre there was an oven-like structure, made of boulders piled upon\r\neach other without any cement whatever. Along the walls were three rows\r\nof seats, made simply from the branches of trees and rising one above\r\nthe other, just like seats at a circus, the first one being near the\r\nground. The people had brought wood beforehand. This they put into the\r\noven and set fire to it. They said to me, "We are going to keep the fire\r\nburning all the time, to heat the stones, and when they are burning hot\r\nthis afternoon we will stop the fire, the place will be cleaned, and\r\nthen we will take our bath."\r\n\r\nWe were soon obliged to go out, on account of the smoke. And the fire\r\nwas kept up all day, boys coming now and then with more firewood to add\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon I went with two women who cleaned the place\r\nthoroughly and took away the ashes, and a big vessel put next the oven\r\nwas filled with water. Slender boughs of birch trees were brought in,\r\nand I wondered why. I found out later! Finally word was sent round that\r\neverything was ready.\r\n\r\nThen my new friends said to me, "Paulus, you will undress in your room\r\nand come to the bath room with nothing on, for there is no place there\r\nto dress or to hang your clothes. We all go there naked."\r\n\r\n"But," said I, "it is 30 degrees below zero."\r\n\r\n"That is nothing," they answered, laughing. "The bath house is close\r\nby--just a stone\'s throw from your place, and you will find it warm\r\nenough there," upon which they left me to get ready themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen I was undressed I looked through the windows and saw men and boys\r\nwithout clothes on running towards the bath house, which they entered\r\nquickly and shut the door.\r\n\r\nIt did not take me much time to reach the bath house. I ran double quick\r\nto it. Oh! wasn\'t it cold on the way! But as soon as I was in I could\r\nfeel the great heat from the oven. It was so warm, and felt so good\r\nafter coming from the icy air.\r\n\r\nThen water was taken from the large vessel and thrown over the stones\r\nwith a big dipper. Steam rose at once; then more water was thrown, until\r\nthe place was full of steam. I could not stand it. It was too hot for\r\nme. "Don\'t stand up, Paulus," they said; "sit on the lower seat." Even\r\nthat was too high for me. I sat on the floor until I got accustomed to\r\nbreathing the hot air. The perspiration was fairly running down my body.\r\nMore water was poured and more steam was raised.\r\n\r\nThen one of the fellows said, "Paulus, let me give you a switching with\r\nthe birch twigs. It is fine; it brings the blood into circulation." One\r\nof the boys began to switch my back, and soon I cried, "Enough, enough,\r\nenough!" Soon all were switching one another, and the one who had\r\nswitched me said, "Paulus, give me a good switching--harder than the one\r\nI gave you." I thought mine had been strong enough; my back must have\r\nbeen as red as a boiled lobster. I followed his injunctions until he\r\nsaid it was enough.\r\n\r\nThen more steam was raised after a while, and after this was done all\r\nshouted, "Let us have another switching before we go." At last I went\r\nout with a few of the men, when, lo! they rolled over two or three times\r\nin the snow, calling out to me to do likewise; that it felt so good. I\r\ndid what they bade me to do. How nice it was! It was a delightful\r\nsensation. Then we got up and ran as fast as we could for our houses.\r\n\r\nAs we ran, they called to me, "Paulus, do not dress at once, and not\r\nbefore you have stopped perspiring." So I walked up and down in my room\r\nfor more than an hour before I dressed. After this I felt like a new\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe Finlanders do not dress like the Laplanders when they are at home;\r\nit is only when they travel that they wear the kapta or pesh. The men\r\nwear long overcoats, lined with woolly sheepskin. The women\'s dress is\r\ncomposed of a body of black cloth, with skirt of thick homespun wool.\r\nTheir long and heavy jackets are also lined with sheepskin inside, and\r\nthey wear hoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n HOW THE LAPPS AND FINNS TRAVEL.--STRANGE-LOOKING SLEIGHS.--DIFFERENT\r\n     VARIETIES.--LASSOING REINDEER.--DESCRIPTION OF THE REINDEER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving this hamlet where I had such an odd bath, I came to a farm\r\nwhere I saw sleighs the like of which I had never seen before. To many\r\nof these were harnessed reindeer with superb horns, while others were\r\nwithout animals.\r\n\r\nThese sleighs looked exactly like little tiny boats, just big enough to\r\ncarry one person and a very small amount of luggage, but not big enough\r\nfor trunks. They were all made of narrow fir-tree planks, strongly\r\nribbed inside just like boats, about seven feet long and two and\r\none-half feet in width at the end, which was the broadest part. The\r\nforward part of some was decked. They all had a strong leather ring to\r\nwhich the traces were fastened. They had holes pierced in their sides\r\nfor strings to pass through from one side to the other to keep\r\neverything fast. They had keels like sailing boats; these were very\r\nstrong and about four inches wide, and varied some in thickness or\r\nheight; many of the keels were much worn from constant use.\r\n\r\nAs I was looking at these sleighs, strange-looking people of very small\r\nstature came out of the farmhouses. These were Lapps, and they were\r\ndressed as I was. We saluted each other and began to speak together in\r\nSwedish, and they wondered where I came from.\r\n\r\nOne of them said to me, "You are looking at our sleighs as if you had\r\nnever seen such ones before."\r\n\r\n"You are right," I replied, "I have never seen such sleighs before, and\r\nif these had been on the shores of a river or lake, I should have taken\r\nthem to be boats."\r\n\r\nThen the Lapp explained: "The higher the keel is the quicker the sleigh\r\ncan go and the faster we can travel. The keel acts like a runner, and\r\nwhen the snow is well packed and crisp, the sides of the sleigh hardly\r\ntouch it; but this makes it the more difficult for a beginner to remain\r\ninside, for the sleigh rocks to and fro."\r\n\r\nThen pointing to a sleigh, he said, "This kind is called \'Kerres.\' They\r\nare used to carry merchandise or people." Then pointing to another,\r\n"This kind is called a \'Lakkek.\'" These were somewhat larger than the\r\nother, and had decks like a vessel, with a sort of hatchway. These were\r\nused as trunks; two had their decks covered with sealskin to make them\r\nmore surely water-tight.\r\n\r\n"In these," said the Lapp, "we carry our woollen clothing, our fine\r\nhandkerchiefs, our jewelry, our silver spoons, our prayer-book and\r\npsalm-book--everything that is precious. In them we also carry our\r\nprovisions, our coffee, our sugar, salt, and everything that has to be\r\nprotected against snow or dampness."\r\n\r\nAnother kind was called "Akja," especially built for fast travelling,\r\nand had keels about two and a half to three inches thick. The forward\r\npart of these was over-decked to about a third of the length, and\r\ncovered with sealskin. The decked part was a sort of box or trunk to\r\nkeep provisions or other things necessary for a journey which required\r\nto be protected. The backs of most of these were leather-cushioned.\r\n\r\nAfter I had looked carefully at all the sleighs, I went to the farmhouse\r\nwith the Lapps and was welcomed by the Finlander who owned the place.\r\nHis name was Jon. We were soon friends.\r\n\r\nThe people asked me whither I was bound, and I told them that I was\r\ngoing as far north as the Arctic Ocean, as far as Nordkyn. Then they\r\nsaid to me, "You cannot go further without learning how to drive\r\nreindeer, for you must give up horses. The snow is too deep and we do\r\nnot use dogs in our country. We will teach you how to drive reindeer and\r\nuse our sleighs; then, when you know, some of us will take you where you\r\nwant to go, either north, east, or west."\r\n\r\nI bought a very pretty sleigh with the forward part decked over, where\r\nsome of my things could be stored. The back was cushioned and covered\r\nwith sealskin made fast with broad rounded-top copper nails. This was a\r\nreally "swell" sleigh.\r\n\r\nThe next day Jon said to me, "Let us go together where my herd of\r\nreindeer is, and lasso those I want to use, for I am going to teach you\r\nmyself how to drive," adding: "I own over one thousand reindeer."\r\n\r\nHe called two other Lapps, and we put on our skees and started, and soon\r\nafter we were out of sight of the house. After an hour\'s travel we\r\nreached the reindeer. I noticed that the snow was not very deep.\r\n\r\n"In this herd I have over sixty reindeer that have been broken to\r\nharness," said Jon.\r\n\r\n"How can you find them out of such a great number?" I asked. "To me so\r\nmany of them look alike, in fact they would all look alike if it were\r\nnot that with some the horns are not as big as those of the others."\r\n\r\n"I know them all," he replied. "I could even tell the ones that are\r\nmissing."\r\n\r\nThen I remembered that I had heard that a shepherd knew every sheep of\r\nhis flock.\r\n\r\n"Stay where you are," said Jon. "Many of the reindeer are shy, and do\r\nnot come to us when we are trying to lasso them."\r\n\r\nJon and the other two Lapps let their skees slip off their feet, so that\r\nthey could have a stronger footing, looked round so as to recognize the\r\ndeer they wanted, and then with their lassos in their hands, ready to be\r\nflung, walked very carefully towards two reindeer somewhat apart from\r\nthe others. When they were near enough, some ten or fifteen yards from\r\nthem, which is about the distance one can lasso with a chance of\r\nsuccess, they stopped and threw their lassos over the horns of the\r\nanimals. One made no effort to escape, for he had been used to this for\r\nmore than five years; but the other cut up any amount of pranks, though\r\nin his efforts to get away the rope got tighter and tighter at the base\r\nof his horns.\r\n\r\nThe man had to use all his strength before the animal was subdued. Once\r\nor twice he was pulled by the reindeer and almost fell. In his efforts\r\nto get away the reindeer entangled his legs in the lasso and fell\r\npowerless. In the mean time Jon had come gently towards his reindeer and\r\nknotted the cord of the lasso round his muzzle.\r\n\r\n"We always do this," said he to me, "as a measure of precaution. When\r\nthus corded the reindeer move with far more difficulty if they wish to\r\nrun away."\r\n\r\nThe other reindeer, which fought so desperately for freedom, had only\r\nbeen used twice during the winter and was not accustomed to being\r\nlassoed.\r\n\r\nThese two animals were tied to trees, and then Jon and the Lapps went to\r\ncapture two others. Jon missed the second reindeer, a splendid bull, on\r\nthe first throw, the lasso falling on his back; but the next throw\r\ncaught him. At the same time the other man had succeeded in lassoing the\r\nfourth one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "The man had to use all his strength."]\r\n\r\nThen Jon, pointing to the second reindeer he had lassoed, said: "Paulus,\r\nI wanted this one especially for you. He is thirteen years old. He is\r\none of my favorites and has been often under harness. He does not go\r\nquite as fast as he did formerly, but he is just the reindeer for\r\nyou, for he is more easily managed than any others I own."\r\n\r\nI looked at the reindeer. I noticed that the animal had much stouter\r\nlegs than the common deer, or even than the elk, and the hoofs were\r\nparticularly large. They are smaller than our own big elks, and looked\r\nvery much like our caribou. The hair of the majority of the reindeer was\r\ngray, very coarse and thick, and almost white under the belly. Some of\r\nthe animals in the herd were white.\r\n\r\nThen we went homeward. Two or three times one of the reindeer made a\r\nlight show of resistance and had to be pulled for a minute or so, and\r\nthe wilder one was even less easy to manage; he struggled hard several\r\ntimes, and twice the Lapp who held him was almost thrown down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n HARNESSING REINDEER.--THE FIRST LESSONS IN DRIVING.--CONSTANTLY UPSET\r\n     AT FIRST.--GOING DOWN HILL WITH REINDEER.--THROWN OUT AT THE\r\n     BOTTOM.--QUEER NOISE MADE BY REINDEER HOOFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our return we tied our reindeer securely and went to a small house\r\nwhere the harness was kept. There I saw along the walls many collars,\r\nleather straps, and traces, but no bits. I thought this was singular,\r\nand I wondered how the reindeer could be driven, but I said nothing. But\r\nwhen harnesses for the reindeer were brought out I found that harnessing\r\na reindeer was very unlike harnessing a horse, and far more simple. A\r\ncollar was put on, and at the lower part of the collar a strong plaited\r\nleather trace was fastened. This passed between the reindeer\'s legs and\r\nwas made fast to the forward part of the sleigh. No bits are used. The\r\nrein (there was only one) was also of plaited leather and fastened at\r\nthe base of the horns.\r\n\r\nDuring this process the reindeer seemed very restless and several times\r\nwere on the point of running away.\r\n\r\n"The harnessing, as you see," said Jon to me, "though simple, has to be\r\ndone with great care, for no matter how well trained a reindeer is, as\r\nsoon as he is harnessed he wants to go; besides, he is easily scared\r\nwhen in harness." So while things were being made ready for the start\r\nthe reindeer were tightly held.\r\n\r\n"I will now show you how to take your place in the sleigh," said Jon.\r\nThen he sat upright at the bottom, with his legs stretched before him\r\nand his back resting against the end of the sleigh. Then he got out and\r\nsaid, "Now you get in." I found the position a very uncomfortable one;\r\nbut this is the only way one can sit in these little sleighs. And it\r\ntook me some time to get accustomed to it without getting tired, though\r\nafterwards I could sit for hours without getting out.\r\n\r\nJon handed me the rein and twisted it round my wrist, and said with a\r\nrather roguish smile: "Now, if you upset, the reindeer cannot run away\r\nwithout you! After a while he will stop when he knows you are tipped\r\nover. You will roll over several times in the snow before he stops."\r\n\r\n"All right," I replied, "there is plenty of snow, no harm can come to\r\nme. My head is safe."\r\n\r\n"Be careful, Paulus," he added; "see that your rein never touches the\r\nsnow, for if it should get under the sleigh your arm might become\r\nentangled and your wrist or shoulder be dislocated. If you upset, let\r\nthe rein go. If you want the reindeer to stop, throw the rein to the\r\nleft. If you want him to go fast, keep it on the right. Keep your rein\r\nalways loose, almost touching the snow. Have a sharp lookout about\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n"I myself will ride with my legs outside, my toes touching the snow to\r\nguide my sleigh; but you are a beginner, and you cannot do so. Never\r\nride with your legs out, for it is dangerous for a man who is not\r\naccustomed to it to ride that way. Sometimes accidents happen even among\r\nthe most expert, and some Lapps get seriously injured. Here is a stick\r\nto guide your sleigh, and to prevent your reindeer from going too fast\r\npush the stick deep into the snow. It will not be as good as feet, but\r\nit is much better than nothing.\r\n\r\n"I will take the lead, you will follow, and two Lapps will come behind\r\nto watch over you. Do not mind if you upset often; do not be\r\ndiscouraged; a beginner has to upset many times before he knows how to\r\ndrive a reindeer and keep in his sleigh."\r\n\r\nIn the mean time our reindeers had become very restive and they were\r\nheld with difficulty. Suddenly Jon gave the order to start.\r\n\r\nWe started at a furious speed, and my sleigh rocked to and fro. It was\r\nawful. I swayed first one way, then another. I knew that I could not\r\nkeep my equilibrium long without being thrown out, and I was right. Each\r\nreindeer wanted to go faster than the others; they kept on at a terrible\r\ngait. I was shot out of the sleigh, heels over head, and rolled over and\r\nover in the snow. Finally the animal stopped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I was shot out of the sleigh."]\r\n\r\nThe Lapps behind me came to the rescue. After brushing the snow from my\r\nface I got in again, and my reindeer started off at a fearful speed, and\r\nin less than thirty seconds I was once more shot out of my sleigh.\r\nThis time the rein slipped from my wrist, as I had not secured it well\r\nenough, and the animal sped away, leaving me on my back, blinded by the\r\nsnow. The Lapps went on their skees after my reindeer, which in the mean\r\ntime had stopped, and brought it back to me.\r\n\r\nThen they said to me with a laugh: "Often reindeer start that way when\r\nthey feel frisky. To-day is the right sort of weather for them. The\r\nmercury marks 40 degrees below zero. The starting is the most difficult\r\npart."\r\n\r\nI thought so! I got into my sleigh, and the animal started at a furious\r\nspeed, and once more I was shot out of the sleigh. I got up half\r\nstunned, covered with snow. Fortunately I had twisted the rein so well\r\nround my wrist this time that the reindeer could not run away without\r\nme, and he stopped after I had been dragged a few seconds.\r\n\r\nI was not disheartened--so I kept on driving and being thrown out. It\r\nhappened so often that I began to tire of counting the number of times I\r\nupset. It must have been nearly one hundred times that day. It had been\r\na very hard day\'s work for me.\r\n\r\nThe second day I took more lessons, and began to learn how to balance\r\nmyself. It is a knack, and I began to improve and had fewer upsettings.\r\nThe third day I did better. I gradually learned pretty well how to\r\nbalance myself on level ground, and did not upset any more.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days I knew how to drive reindeer on level ground, and I\r\ncould guide my sleigh with a stick as well as a sailor steers his boat\r\nwith the rudder.\r\n\r\nWhen I had reached this stage of expertness Jon said to me: "Paulus, now\r\nyou can drive in a level country, but soon you will come where there are\r\nmany steep hills, and mountains. So you must learn how to drive down\r\nsteep hills. This is often very exciting. The weather is beautiful, and\r\nthis afternoon I want you to take your first lesson going down hill. I\r\nhave sent men for a fresh set of reindeer; they will soon be back."\r\n\r\nIn the course of the afternoon the reindeer came out harnessed, and as\r\nwe were ready to start, "I will lead," said Jon, "you will follow, and\r\nanother Lapp will come third. It is far more difficult to go down hill\r\nthan to drive on a level surface. You must put your stick deep into the\r\nsnow to slacken the speed and guide your sleigh. Don\'t be frightened at\r\nthe speed, which is very great, and be careful not to be thrown out when\r\nyou reach the bottom of the hill; this is the most difficult part of\r\ndriving, for the reindeer turn sharply so as not to have the sleigh\r\nstrike their legs." At this remark I thought of my going down hill on\r\nskees. That was hard enough, and I wondered what would happen to me with\r\nthe sleigh.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the country was slightly undulating, and our reindeer\r\nfollowed each other in good order and at a short distance from one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Jon slackened the pace of his reindeer so that I should\r\novertake him. Then, when within hearing distance, he called out: "We\r\nwill soon go down a steep hill," and he started again.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly said these words when he was out of sight. I reached the\r\ncrest of the hill, then down went my reindeer at a terrible pace,\r\nrailway speed in fact, and as the animal reached the bottom of the hill\r\nhe made a sudden sharp curve. For a few seconds my body swayed from one\r\nside to the other, and before I knew it I was flung headlong out of the\r\nsleigh.\r\n\r\nThis took place in a great deal less time than I can tell it in. I had\r\nbeen thrown out with great force against the snow, face forward, and as\r\nthe snow was granulated it hurt.\r\n\r\nI had learned to be quick. I was in my sleigh in the twinkling of an eye\r\nand followed the track made by Jon, and we rode quietly on the plain.\r\nSoon Jon stopped and a moment after I joined him.\r\n\r\n"Paulus," said he, when I had caught up with him, "we must try another\r\ndescent." We ascended the bank in a zigzag way (I following his track)\r\nuntil we reached the summit. It was hard work. This hill was very long\r\nand steep. When ready Jon shouted: "Paulus, look out; we are going to\r\nhave another descent." The pace of my reindeer was tremendous as he went\r\ndown. The animal seemed to know that if he did not go fast enough the\r\nsleigh would strike against his legs as he descended the hill. Down we\r\nwent; we simply seemed to fly, and as the reindeer got to the bottom he\r\nmade the same sharp turn again, the sleigh whirled round with a great\r\njerk, and I was thrown out head over heels as before.\r\n\r\nDuring the descent, as my animal ran his hind feet threw particles of\r\ngranulated snow in my face--they were like small stones striking it with\r\ngreat force. It hurt awfully. After this I was obliged to put on my mask\r\nfor protection that day.\r\n\r\nEver since I had begun driving reindeer I had heard a noise, a sharp\r\nsound, as if sticks of wood were striking against each other, when the\r\nanimals were trotting at full speed. It occurred to me to ask what was\r\nthe cause of this curious noise. My Lapp replied, "Every time the hoof\r\nof the reindeer touches the snow it spreads wide apart, broadening in\r\nthis way and keeping the animal from sinking too deep in the snow; and\r\nwhen the foot is lifted, the two sides of the hoof are brought together\r\nagain, striking against each other and making the noise you hear."\r\n\r\nI continued to improve every day in going down hill, and succeeded at\r\nlast in keeping in by throwing my body in the opposite direction when\r\nthe reindeer made his sharp turn. This difficulty conquered, I bade Jon\r\na hearty good-bye, thanking him for his patience in teaching me, and\r\ncontinued my journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "At noon I saw the sun\'s lower rim touching the\r\nhorizon."]\r\n\r\nFrom Rukojarvi I had followed the highroad, passed the post stations of\r\nKorpilombolo with its church, Sattajarvi, and came to the hamlet of\r\nPajala, in latitude 67\xc2\xb0 10\'. The hamlet is situated near the junction of\r\nthe Torne river with the Muonio, and had a church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n THE LAST DAYS OF THE SUN.--BEGINNING OF THE LONG NIGHT.--A MIGHTY WALL\r\n     OF ICE.--THE LONG NIGHT\'S WARNING VOICE.--THE AURORA BOREALIS AND\r\n     ITS MAGNIFICENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day I left Pajala I saw the sun at noon; it was hardly above the\r\nhorizon; it had barely risen and shown itself when it was sunset and it\r\ndisappeared under the horizon.\r\n\r\nThen came a long snowstorm, and for a wonder one without a gale. After\r\nthe snowstorm the sky suddenly cleared, and at noon I saw the sun\'s\r\nlower rim touching the horizon. It was of a fiery red. Then after a\r\nwhile it disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe next day only the upper half of the sun was above the horizon at\r\nnoon, and just as the rim was ready to sink I fancied I heard the sun\r\nsay to me: "To-morrow you will not see me; then you will have entered\r\n\'The Land of the Long Night,\' and when you go further and further north\r\nyou will be in that land. Good-bye, good-bye."\r\n\r\nThen I thought I heard the "Long Night" say to me: "For one night of six\r\nmonths I rule at the North Pole. Then I am most powerful. In the course\r\nof countless years I have frozen the sea and I have built a wall of ice\r\nso thick, and so broad, and so hard, that no vessel will ever be strong\r\nenough to break through, and no man will ever reach the pole. I guard\r\nthe approach to the pole and watch carefully the wall of ice I have\r\nbuilt around it. When the sun drives me away and rules in his turn one\r\nday of six months at the pole (for the whole year is equally divided\r\nbetween us), he tries with his steady heat to destroy the wall I have\r\nbuilt. On my return I repair the damage the sun has done and make the\r\nwall as strong as it was before. I send terrific gales and mighty\r\nsnowstorms over oceans and lands, and even far to the south of my\r\ndominion, for my power is so great that it is felt beyond my realm."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause; then I thought I heard the sardonic laugh of the\r\n"Long Night." I shuddered when I remembered the words the "Long Night"\r\nhad just spoken, and the laugh had in it something sinister. I fancied I\r\nsaw the dim figure of a woman with long flowing hair standing at the\r\npole, looking towards me. She was the "Long Night." I remembered the\r\nnames of the valiant and daring commanders who had led expeditions\r\ntowards the North Pole, and had perished in their endeavors with the\r\ngallant men who had trusted and followed them.\r\n\r\nThen I thought of the brave explorers who had followed in their wake\r\nwith better fortune, for their lives had been spared, though they failed\r\nto reach the pole. The wall the "Long Night" had built could not be\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nAs these thoughts came over me, I exclaimed: "\'Long Night,\' great and\r\nterrible indeed has been the loss of life among those who have tried to\r\nreach the pole, but the ingenuity of man is great, and in spite of the\r\nice barrier thou hast built around it we have not lost hope that man by\r\nsome device of his own may yet be able to reach the pole."\r\n\r\nAfter uttering these words I imagined I heard, again coming from the far\r\nnorth, another laugh of the "Long Night." It seemed like a laugh of\r\ndefiance in response to what I had said.\r\n\r\nNear me was a forest of tall fir trees; looking up I saw the great blue\r\nof heaven studded all over with brilliant stars shining down upon the\r\nsnow-covered land where I was.\r\n\r\nThe next day the sun did not appear. I was now in "The Land of the Long\r\nNight." It was strange now to see stars all the time, and the moon in\r\nthe place of the sun. The great pines and fir trees of the forest\r\ncontrasted strongly with the snow of the land.\r\n\r\nThe sun had disappeared below the horizon, but in clear days its glow\r\ncould be seen. I could not tell the hour of the day, for the stars set\r\nand rose in continuous succession in this kingdom of the "Long Night." I\r\ndid not know when it was morning or when it was evening, but in fine\r\nweather the glow over the horizon told me when it was about noon. It was\r\nindeed a strange land; but the Lapps could tell from the stars whether\r\nit was night or day, for they were accustomed to gauge time by them\r\naccording to their height above the horizon, just as we do at home with\r\nthe sun. I had my watch, but could not look at it often, for it was\r\nunder my garments.\r\n\r\nFor many days the land was illuminated for a while every night by the\r\naurora borealis, or Northern Lights. Sometimes the aurora seemed to\r\nimitate the waves of the sea and moved like big heavy swells, changing\r\ncolors, bluish, white, violet, green, orange. These colors seemed to\r\nblend together. Then the heaving mass would become gradually intensely\r\nred. This red mass broke into fragments which scattered themselves all\r\nover the blue sky. It gave its reflection to the snow. It was the end of\r\nthe aurora or electric storm. They were never twice alike; they varied\r\nin forms and colors. The auroras are like everything in creation: on our\r\nearth there not two men or women exactly alike, there are not two leaves\r\nalike, two blades of grass, two trees, two stones alike, neither two\r\nwaves, for the sea is ever changing in its ripples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n THE SNOW GETTING DEEPER.--LAPP HOSPITALITY.--A LAPP REPAST.--COFFEE\r\n     AND TOBACCO LAPP STAPLES.--BABIES IN STRANGE CRADLES.--HOW THE\r\n     TENTS ARE MADE.--GOING TO SLEEP WITH THE MERCURY AT 39\xc2\xb0 BELOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I had left Pajala I travelled on the frozen Muonio, passed the\r\nstations of Kaunisvaara, Killangi, and Parkajoki, and came to\r\nMuonioniska. All the hamlets or farms had comfortable log buildings.\r\nSome of the dwelling-houses were quite large. Wood was not lacking and\r\nthe houses were quite warm. Forests of the fir were abundant.\r\n\r\nThe sun was now hidden below the horizon. The snow was getting deeper\r\nevery hour--and was about seven or eight feet deep on a level after\r\nbeing packed. I was coming to another great "Snow Land." From\r\nMuonioniska I travelled on between the Muonio and Ouanasjoki rivers.\r\n(Joki means river in Finnish.) I became acquainted with many nomadic\r\nLapps who wandered with their reindeer over that great snow land--among\r\nthem were two very pleasant men of the name of Pinta and Wasara, who\r\nagreed to travel with me for a while.\r\n\r\nWasara, the younger, was the son of a very rich Lapp who owned nearly\r\nten thousand reindeer, and possessed besides a good bank account.\r\n\r\nPinta was poor, the possessor of only about one hundred reindeer, which\r\npastured with those of his elder brother. Pinta was about thirty years\r\nold; Wasara about twenty-five. Both were men of splendid physique; broad\r\nshouldered with very muscular legs and arms, which were apparently as\r\nhard as wood. They had blue eyes and fair hair. One was four feet eight\r\ninches and a half in height, the other was four feet ten inches. They\r\nwere very skilful on skees; in summer they could make tremendous leaps\r\nover rivers and ditches with the long poles they carried with them, and\r\ncould drive the most intractable reindeer, which are even worse than our\r\nbroncos.\r\n\r\nWhile travelling, I drove next to the leader, for reindeer follow each\r\nother mechanically in the same furrow. The leader is the one that has\r\nthe most work; but if he follows a furrow, his reindeer gives him little\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nPinta generally took the lead, I came next, and Wasara third. Pinta and\r\nWasara had their faithful dogs with them.\r\n\r\nTravelling was fine; the snow was well packed, and so crisp that the\r\nsleighs glided over it lightly. Often we travelled at the rate of\r\nfifteen miles an hour, for our animals were strong and had not been used\r\nfor several days.\r\n\r\nHow I shouted, for I had such an exuberance of spirits. I felt so\r\nstrong and healthy. I wanted to go, to go onward, to go all the time.\r\nSometimes I felt like running, like jumping. One could not help it, for\r\nit was the atmosphere that made one feel so. I could not get tired.\r\n\r\nThe fine weather, however, lasted but a few days. Then the sky became\r\ngray, there was not a star to be seen, the wind began to rise, and snow\r\nfell. We could see nothing. Wasara thought we were near the tent of his\r\nfather, but we could not see any landmark to guide us.\r\n\r\nThe two dogs ran in every direction, to try to scent people. They seemed\r\nto know that we were looking after the tent of Wasara\'s father; but each\r\ntime they would return looking in the face of their masters silently, as\r\nif to say "We find nothing."\r\n\r\nWe were somewhat afraid of wolves, but trusted in the dogs to warn us of\r\ntheir approach. We at last concluded to stop; we kept the reindeer\r\nharnessed and stood near them. We fixed our hoods carefully over our\r\nfaces, put on our masks, and seated ourselves on the snow. Soon I heard\r\nheavy snoring--Pinta and Wasara were fast asleep, with their heads\r\ndownward and arms crossed on their breasts. The Lapps sleep often in\r\nthat way when travelling. But the weather cleared after three or four\r\nhours and we continued our journey. My two friends then knew where they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour\'s drive we saw in the midst of the snow, near a large\r\nforest of fir trees, a tent. "Here is the tent of my father," said\r\nWasara, pointing out the tent to me.\r\n\r\nWe hurried our reindeer, and as we approached the place more than a\r\ndozen Lapp dogs, wolf-like in appearance, announced our arrival by their\r\nfierce barking.\r\n\r\nWasara\'s father came outside of the tent, drove the dogs away, and told\r\nthem to be quiet. He recognized his son and bade us come in.\r\n\r\n"What a strange abode these nomadic Lapps have," I said to myself, as I\r\nlooked around inside of the tent. According to Lapp etiquette the left\r\nside of the tent was given to us, soft reindeer skins being first laid\r\non the top of branches of young birch trees that were spread on the\r\nfloor of earth, the snow having been removed where they had pitched\r\ntheir tent.\r\n\r\nThe father took his snuffbox from a small bag and offered me a pinch of\r\nsnuff. This ceremony meant that I was welcome, and I passed the snuffbox\r\nto his son who, in turn, offered a pinch of snuff to Pinta.\r\n\r\nI looked with astonishment at the people that were in the tent, and\r\neverything that surrounded me. These Lapps had blue eyes; their faces,\r\nowing to exposure to the blustering winds, were very red, but the\r\nprotected part of the skin was as white as that of the whitest people.\r\nThere were a number of women and men, several young girls and two lads.\r\nI was told that there were two men with the reindeer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "What a strange abode these nomadic Lapps have!"]\r\n\r\nThe women were all busy; one was weaving shoe-bands of bright colors,\r\nred predominating; another was just finishing a "kapta," and a third one\r\nwas putting a lining of red flannel over the seams upon a tiny pair of\r\nreindeer-skin shoes for a child; the girls were sewing some\r\nundergarments.\r\n\r\nWasara\'s father\'s first name was Pehr,--he was a fine-looking Lapp,\r\nabout seventy years old. His father was living, and was about ninety\r\nyears old. The outdoor life agrees with the Lapp. Give me the plateaus\r\nof the Arctic regions for health. There are plenty of mosquitoes in\r\nsummer, but no malaria at any time. Nor is there any sore throat there.\r\nI do not remember, indeed, ever to have heard a person cough in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe material of the tent was of very coarse woollen stuff, called\r\n"vadmal." The tent was about thirteen feet in diameter at the ground.\r\nIts frame was composed of poles fitting each other; the wood had become\r\nblack from being smoked for years. These poles are so well knitted\r\ntogether that they can resist the terrific winds which blow over the\r\nland. A cross pole high up sustained an iron chain, at the end of which\r\nis a hook to hold the kettle and cooking pot. The coarse woollen stuff\r\nwhich covered the frame was composed of two pieces that were made fast\r\nby strings. The nature of the vadmal permits the wind to go gently\r\nthrough. The entrance is by a small sliding door made of the same\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nInside, along the lower part of the tent, were boxes of different shapes\r\nand sizes, packages lying on the top of skins to prevent the wind from\r\nblowing in from the bottom; the outside was protected by snow.\r\n\r\nAs I glanced around I saw two queer-looking things, resembling in shape\r\nthe sabots or wooden shoes of the peasantry of Europe, only very much\r\nlarger, hanging near the sides. I looked in, and to my great\r\nastonishment saw a Lapp baby in each. They were Lapp cradles, called\r\n"katkem" or "komse." They were made of a single piece of wood and were\r\nabout two and a half feet long by fifteen or eighteen inches wide. In\r\none was such a sweet Lapp baby, a dear little girl, with her eyes wide\r\nopen. As I looked at her she smiled. In the other was a big fat boy,\r\nfast asleep.\r\n\r\nTwo women went out and collected a lot of snow, which they put on to\r\nmelt in a big iron pot hanging over the fire. This is the way the Lapps\r\nhave to do to procure water. When the snow had melted she put the water\r\nin a coffee kettle that had a spout. One of the women ground coffee in a\r\nmill. Then the ground coffee was put into the kettle and left to boil\r\nfor quite a while, the woman watching it, taking off the pot when it was\r\nabout to boil over, and then putting it over the fire again. The third\r\nwoman was attending to the cups and saucers. When the coffee was ready\r\nthey put in a little bit of salt to give it flavor, then set the coffee\r\nkettle on the ground and put into it a small piece of dried fishskin to\r\nclarify it and precipitate the grounds at the bottom of the kettle.\r\n\r\nWhen the coffee was ready to be poured, one of the women went out and\r\ncame back with reindeer milk which had remained frozen for over three\r\nmonths. Then the coffee was served. The wife bit several pieces of rock\r\ncandy from a big lump, to sweeten each cup of coffee, and after putting\r\nin frozen reindeer milk with a spoon, licked it with her tongue--"What\r\nis the use of being particular when one travels," I said to myself. If\r\none were, he would starve. We had silver spoons, round in shape, with\r\ntwisted handles. "These," said the father, "have been in the possession\r\nof our family for nearly two hundred years." I saw different initials\r\nand different dates from the year 1700 down.\r\n\r\nAfter coffee men, women, and the young girls filled their pipes and had\r\na good smoke. They were very much astonished when I told them I had\r\nnever smoked in my life.\r\n\r\n"There are two things we Lapps have always with us--coffee and tobacco.\r\nAfter a hard day\'s work or a long journey there is nothing so refreshing\r\nas coffee," said Pehr Wasara, smacking his lips at the very thought.\r\n\r\nWhile we were chatting, Pehr was busy cutting reindeer meat and putting\r\nthe pieces in a pot hanging over the fire which had been filled with\r\nsnow that had melted. When he had finished, he said: "By and by you will\r\nhave something to eat." I was prodigiously hungry; travelling over the\r\nsnow in a temperature between 35 and 45 degrees below zero, as I had\r\ndone for several days, gives one such a good appetite! While waiting for\r\nthe meal to be ready, I went outside the tent with my host.\r\n\r\nThe sight outside was quite as strange as the inside of the tent.\r\nNumerous Lapp sleighs were scattered here and there, skees were lying on\r\nthe ground in different directions. Quarters and other large pieces of\r\nreindeer meat, out of the reach of wolves, foxes, and dogs, were\r\nsuspended to the branches of trees. On two racks about eight feet high\r\nabove the ground were pieces of reindeer meat piled upon each other.\r\nCollars, traces, reins, everything for the harnessing of reindeer, were\r\nseen all round the tent; buckets full of frozen reindeer milk, filled\r\nlate in the autumn, were on the ground. Hanging on trees were bladders\r\nfilled with congealed milk or blood.\r\n\r\nThe sleighs were of different kinds; several were decked over and used\r\nas trunks. Others were empty. Four were filled with hoofs of the\r\nreindeer they had killed to subsist upon during the winter.\r\n\r\nSkins of wolves, of white foxes, of reindeer, were stretched on frames,\r\nso that they could not shrink. Reindeer pack-saddles, empty pails,\r\nwooden vessels, lay here and there. Fur garments and underwear were\r\nhanging to the branches of trees. It was a strange sight indeed! But a\r\nsight I met thereafter at almost every camp.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was ready we were called in. The host served the meat,\r\nwhich had been put in a large platter, in portions, guessing what would\r\nsatisfy the hunger of each person. The fattest parts, which are\r\nconsidered the most dainty, were given to me, being the guest of honor,\r\nand the meat was served to us in wooden plates. We had nothing but\r\nreindeer meat. I was getting accustomed to eat meat without bread or\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal small pieces of roots of fir trees, which are full of\r\nresin, were thrown into the fire for light. After the meal I thanked all\r\nfor it, according to the custom. Then the Lapps lighted their pipes\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nPehr Wasara employed a man and a woman servant. From their clothing you\r\ncould not tell them apart from the other people. They were treated like\r\nmembers of the family. The girl was paid three reindeer a year, the man\r\nsix.\r\n\r\n"How much can you buy a tent for?" I inquired of Pehr Wasara. "Thirty or\r\nforty dollars," he replied. "This is a great deal of money for us poor\r\nLapps." Pehr had plenty of money in the bank, but pretended poverty. I\r\nlearned also that a trained reindeer costs eight dollars.\r\n\r\nI asked many questions. How long a tent lasted? He replied: "The vadmal\r\nis very durable, and a tent lasts about twenty years, but it has to be\r\npatched very often during that time." I looked round and saw a good many\r\npatches, and I thought of the story of the knife and handle,--first the\r\nblade broke, then a new blade was put in; after this the handle broke,\r\nand a new handle was put on. I remembered that once a dear old aunt of\r\nmine said to me: "Paul, this black silk dress has lasted me twenty\r\nyears." I exclaimed, "Twenty years, aunty! Are you sure of this?" Then\r\nin the course of a few days, by indirect questions I found out that she\r\nhad had three new bodices put on at different times, and three different\r\nskirts. I thought the tent of the Lapp might be twenty years old in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal had been finished the babies were taken from their\r\ncradles, and their little beds were made afresh. The cradle bottoms were\r\ncovered with fine, soft, well-dried lichen or reindeer moss, over which\r\na little cotton sheet was spread. The babies were stark naked, and were\r\nwrapped in little sheepskins while their beds were being made. Then they\r\nwere laid in, the sheet turned down, with a coarse piece of vadmal and\r\nsheepskin over it; the whole was made fast by a cord fastened through\r\nholes on each side of the cradle and laced across.\r\n\r\nOne of the mothers said to me: "When a child is born it is the custom\r\namong Lapps to give him or her a reindeer. When baptized the sponsor,\r\ntoo, often gives a reindeer to the babe, and these animals, and the\r\nincrease thereof, become the child\'s own property."\r\n\r\nThis woman, pointing out her sister to me, observed: "When my baby had\r\nhis first teeth, my sister here presented him with a reindeer. This is a\r\ncustom among us Lapps."\r\n\r\nThen two of the men and two of the women with their dogs and their\r\nskees went to relieve the people who were watching the reindeer herd,\r\nand Pehr Wasara remarked, "My reindeer are divided in a number of\r\nherds--for they could not all pasture together. We are afraid of wolves.\r\nThese people are to remain on the watch all night."\r\n\r\nThe family was very pious; they were, like all the Lapps, Lutherans.\r\nBefore going to sleep they sang psalms and hymns, praising God for the\r\nblessings of the day.\r\n\r\nThen they dressed themselves for the night, putting on over the garments\r\nthey wore during the day a long reindeer kapta, a sort of nightshirt\r\nreaching below the feet. More reindeer skins were put over the skins on\r\nwhich we were seated. Then a big bearskin was given to me as a blanket,\r\nPehr saying, "I killed this bear myself."\r\n\r\nBefore retiring I took off my shoes, the Lapp grass, and my stockings,\r\nand hung them on the cross poles to dry. All did likewise. I carefully\r\narranged my precious Lapp grass so every vestige of dampness would be\r\nabsorbed when I should put it on again in the morning. One of the women\r\nlent me a pair of her own stockings, which she took from one of the\r\nlittle chests by her side.\r\n\r\nThe fire had gradually died out. "We seldom keep fires burning at\r\nnight," said the head of the family, "for it would be dangerous." The\r\ndogs were driven out and the door made secure, comparatively speaking.\r\nWe were all huddled close together. Then we bade each other good-night.\r\nI looked at my thermometer, it marked 39 degrees below zero inside the\r\ntent; it was 46 degrees outside and everything was perfectly still,\r\nthere was not a breath of air stirring. Through the opening in the tent\r\nfor the smoke to pass, I could see the stars twinkling in the blue sky\r\nas I lay on my back. Then putting my head under my bearskin I soon fell\r\nasleep, though some dogs succeeded in smuggling themselves in, and two\r\nor three times they awoke me by trying to get under my bearskin and lie\r\nby me. They did likewise with the other people. Once I was awakened by a\r\nbig booming sound. It was the cracking of the ice over a lake not far\r\noff from us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n TOILET WITH SNOW.--A LAPP BREAKFAST.--LAPP DOGS.--TALKS WITH MY LAPP\r\n     FRIEND ABOUT THE REINDEER.--THEIR HABITS AND VARIOUS FORMS OF\r\n     USEFULNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we awoke in the morning it was 40 degrees below zero in the tent\r\nand 48 degrees below outside. I felt like washing my face and my hands,\r\nbut melted snow was sure to turn into ice as soon as it was on my face.\r\nI did not want to wash in warm water, for it would have made my skin too\r\ntender. So I rubbed my face and hands with snow and dried them\r\nthoroughly. This was my usual morning wash when I slept out of doors.\r\n\r\nA big fire was lighted and the maidservant went to work kneading\r\ndough--yeast was not used. The loaves were baked on charcoal, as is\r\noften done among the Lapps, and at the same time coffee was made.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was composed of the dry powdered blood of reindeer, mixed\r\nwith flour, diluted in warm water and made into pancake. We had a\r\nporridge of dried reindeer\'s milk that had been stirred in warm water\r\nwith a wooden spoon. The milk of the reindeer is very rich and thick.\r\nWhen it was served to me, the wife remarked: "This food is very\r\nnutritious." We also had some reindeer meat and finished up with\r\nreindeer cheese and a cup of coffee. It was a fine breakfast. I ate\r\nheartily of everything. When it is so cold one is always hungry. After\r\nthe breakfast, all the household with the exception of the host and\r\nhostess started on their skees for the reindeer herd, which was to be\r\nremoved to some other quarters, for the moss had been more or less eaten\r\nand they were to take them to a place where the snow was not so deep.\r\nThe mothers had slung their cradles with their babies on their\r\nshoulders. Each Lapp was followed by his dog.\r\n\r\nAbout one hour after breakfast the night watch returned with their dogs.\r\nImmediately the wife gave to each a cup of coffee; then they took their\r\nbreakfast. They gave their dogs some of the powdered blood mixed with\r\nflour and warm water. The dogs relished this greatly. Then they were\r\ngiven the bones, which they had been watching with glaring eyes. They\r\nwent out with them and gnawed them until there was nothing left of them.\r\nSuch is generally the meal given to the dogs every day. Once in a while\r\nthey get a small piece of meat, which they swallow voraciously in a\r\nsingle mouthful.\r\n\r\nWhen the night watch had done eating they went to sleep; so did their\r\ndogs. These Lapp dogs are thickset. They resemble the Pomeranian breed,\r\nbut are larger; their hair is long, very thick, and bushy. Their ears\r\nstand upright; they seem to have some wolf blood in them. The tail is\r\ncurly. Pehr Wasara said to me: "Lapps could not do without their dogs.\r\nThey are faithful animals; they are our helpmates; they keep our\r\nreindeer together when we are on the march, watch them when they are\r\npasturing; they look out constantly for wolves, and warn us when they\r\nare in the neighborhood, and of their approach beforehand, and attack\r\nthem without fear. Neither are they afraid of bears. They are very\r\nbrave.\r\n\r\n"Every man, woman, manservant or maidservant and grown-up child, has his\r\nor her dog which obeys and listens to his master alone. They are never\r\nallowed to stay behind; wherever their master goes they go, and watch\r\nwith him night and day if necessary. Occasionally, for some reason\r\nunknown to us, or because the deer scent the wolves afar off, a panic\r\nseizes the herd of reindeer, and instinctively they move away. That is\r\nthe time when our dogs prove most useful and of the greatest service to\r\nus. They go around in every direction and bring the reindeer together.\r\nThey seem to know that there is some unseen danger. When the wolves come\r\ninto the herd, the dogs attack them fiercely and act with great cunning,\r\ntaking care not to be bitten by them and waiting for the opportunity to\r\nspring on the wolves."\r\n\r\nWhile Pehr was talking I wished I could see a pack of wolves attacking\r\nreindeer, to see how the dogs fight them.\r\n\r\n"Do not think," added Pehr, "that it is our inclination to be harsh\r\ntowards our dogs. We never overfeed them; it is the only way to keep\r\nthem hardy, strong, and healthy. They are not allowed to rest until\r\ntheir master or mistress has returned to the tent. Then we want them to\r\nstay out doors."\r\n\r\n"I should like very much," I said to Pehr, "to see how you break in\r\nreindeer and accustom them to harness."\r\n\r\n"Well," he replied, "you will see how we train our reindeer to draw\r\nsledges. You came just in time, for we are now training some, as we have\r\nseveral that are getting too old. The males are used as draught animals,\r\nas they are stronger than the females. When the snow is in good\r\ncondition they can draw as much as four hundred pounds, or two or three\r\nlogs of pine or fir."\r\n\r\nSo he sent two men after the reindeer. They took their lassos with them,\r\nand in less than an hour they returned with two reindeer.\r\n\r\n"The process of teaching a reindeer to draw a sleigh or carry a pack on\r\nhis back," observed Pehr, "is very tedious and very hard work. Some of\r\nthe reindeer are more difficult to teach than others, and in spite of\r\nthe best training the wild nature and restlessness of the animal shows\r\nitself not infrequently."\r\n\r\nI thought so. I remembered my first lessons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I went outside the tent with my host."]\r\n\r\n"We begin to train the reindeer," he continued, "when he is about three\r\nyears old, and he does not become a well trained animal before he is\r\nfive. When they are under training a daily lesson is given them to let\r\nthem know their masters, and also a lesson to accustom them to be\r\nlassoed, of which they are very much afraid at first. We give them salt\r\nand angelica, of which they are very fond, every day, to make them\r\ncome when they are needed, and in that case the lasso is not necessary.\r\nThey are never subjected to ill-treatment at any time; if they were we\r\ncould do nothing with them."\r\n\r\nThe work of teaching the reindeer to draw a sleigh began. Salt was first\r\ngiven to one of the deer, which he seemed to enjoy very much. Then\r\nwithout trouble a very strong leather cord with a loop was put carefully\r\nover his horns, and the loop was drawn tight at the base. The collar was\r\ncarefully put on his neck and more salt given to him. The trace attached\r\nto the sleigh was much longer than those used when driving; it was\r\nseveral yards in length, so that the sleigh could not be touched when\r\nthe animal kicked; then it was tied to the collar of the reindeer. As\r\nsoon as the animal was urged to move, and felt the weight of the sleigh,\r\nhe plunged wildly forward and kicked, then plunged first in one\r\ndirection and then in another. It was a great sight. I thought they\r\nwould never be able to break the animal in. It required all the strength\r\nof the Lapp not to be dragged by the animal. The other man, with a cord,\r\nheld the sleigh. After a few trials both man and beast were exhausted.\r\n\r\nA short rest was then taken and another trial was made. With repeated\r\nrests for the trainer and the animal, the day\'s lesson proceeded. The\r\ntrainer was in profuse perspiration, though it was 38 degrees below\r\nzero. My host said to me: "This exercise is repeated day after day until\r\nthe animal submits to it. They are in their prime at seven or eight\r\nyears and can work till the age of fifteen or seventeen years. The\r\nreason we have to wander so much with our reindeer is that we have to go\r\nwhere the snow is not so deep as in other parts, for the reindeer has to\r\ndig into the snow to find his food, the lichen, and he cannot go deeper\r\nthan three or four feet. We generally know where these places are, for\r\nthe wind, which blows every year more or less in the same direction,\r\nblows away a part of the snow. When we come to such a place we pitch our\r\ntent."\r\n\r\n"When the reindeer is left to himself can he find such a place?" I\r\ninquired. "How can the animals know that the snow is only three or four\r\nfeet deep?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know," he replied, "but the wild reindeer can find it,\r\notherwise they would starve."\r\n\r\n"How can they dig through the snow?" I asked with a smile. "They have no\r\nshovels."\r\n\r\nPehr laughed at my remark. "Their fore feet are their shovels," he\r\nreplied. "You will see for yourself how they dig the snow."\r\n\r\nI asked Pehr also about the speed of the reindeer.\r\n\r\n"The speed of the reindeer," he replied, "varies very much according to\r\nthe time of the year and the state of the snow, October, November and\r\nDecember being the months when they are the fleetest, as they are fresh\r\nfrom the summer pastures. January and February are also very good months\r\nfor them. The cold weather strengthens them, and they are not yet\r\nexhausted from digging through the snow, as they are at the end of the\r\nseason. The rapidity of their gait depends very much also on the state\r\nof the surface of the snow. If it is well packed and crisp, they go very\r\nfast. Much depends, too, upon the distance and whether the country is\r\nhilly or not, or with a long range of slopes. On the rivers, over well\r\npacked snow, and a good track that has been furrowed by previous\r\nreindeer, they can average twelve or fifteen miles an hour when in good\r\ncondition, sometimes twenty for the first hour; down a mountain slope\r\ntwenty and twenty-five. They can travel five or six hours without\r\nstopping; the first hour very rapidly, the second more slowly, and\r\ntowards the fifth and sixth hours still more slowly, perhaps not more\r\nthan eight or ten miles an hour, for by that time they require rest and\r\nfood, and we unharness them in places where the snow is not deep, and\r\nlet them get their food. Early in the winter, when they are in good\r\ncondition, one can travel with a swift bull reindeer one hundred and\r\nfifty miles in a day, and even two hundred miles if the condition of the\r\nsnow is favorable and the cold is 30 or 40 degrees below zero. The\r\ncolder the weather is the greater is the speed. Seventy or eighty miles\r\na day is a good average for a reindeer."\r\n\r\nWhen this talk was ended, Pehr Wasara said to me, "Let us take our skees\r\nand go to one of my herds near by." After a run of about two miles we\r\ncame into the midst of a herd of about three thousand reindeer. "There\r\nare more," he said with pride. "Are they not fine animals?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, they are," I replied.\r\n\r\nWhile I was looking at the magnificent horns of some of the beasts, Pehr\r\nremarked: "The horns of the males, which often weigh forty pounds,\r\nattain the full size at the age of six or seven years, those of the cow\r\nat about four years. The time the reindeer drops his horns is from March\r\nuntil May. In the adult animals they attain their full size in September\r\nor at the beginning of October. After the age of eight years the\r\nbranches gradually drop off. They are the easiest animals that man can\r\nkeep. They require no barns. They are never housed. They like cold\r\nweather and snow. Food has not to be stored for them. They will not\r\ntouch the moss that has been gathered unless brought up to do so by\r\nfarmers. They get their food themselves. We do not give them water. When\r\nthirsty they eat the snow. When our people go among them they will often\r\nnot even raise their heads, and remain quiet when we pitch our tents.\r\nOnce in a while there is so much snow in some districts that it is\r\nimpossible for reindeer to get at the moss; then the only way is to go\r\nto the lowlands, or into the forest, where the reindeer can feed on the\r\nmoss hanging from the firs or pines.\r\n\r\n"Some of the reindeer," he went on, "though trained to eat kept moss,\r\nhay, and even bread, thrive only when they are free to roam about; they\r\ncannot be kept all the time in their stables. They must wander over the\r\nsnow and eat it. Otherwise they are sure to degenerate and become\r\nuseless as draught animals."\r\n\r\n"How many reindeer," I asked, "does a family require for its support?"\r\n\r\nHe replied, "A thousand at least. A herd of two thousand to two thousand\r\nfive hundred gives from two hundred to two hundred and seventy-five,\r\nperhaps three hundred, calves a year. Sometimes we have bad years with\r\nour reindeer. Some years prove unfavorable to their increase. Some years\r\nthe snow is very deep, which prevents them from digging for food; the\r\nherd then become emaciated from their exertions and want of sufficient\r\nfood, and many die.\r\n\r\n"Some Lapps," he added, "own five or six thousand reindeer, one or two\r\namong us, eight or ten thousand. The spring is a bad time for them; the\r\nsnow melts during the day from the sun\'s heat, and a thick crust forms\r\nat night from the frost, so that their feet break through, causing\r\nlameness and disease. At that time we move them as much as we can only\r\nduring the day, but it is hard work for them to go through the soft\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n"Without the reindeer we could not exist in this northern land of snow.\r\nThe reindeer is our horse, our beast of burden. On him we feed. He gives\r\nus our clothing, our shoes, our gloves; his skin is our blanket and our\r\nbed; his sinews our thread. On the march a herd of reindeer is easily\r\nmanaged. We keep them together without much trouble, and in winter they\r\nremain where we leave them to get the moss; but if the wolves are after\r\nthem, then they flee in every direction, and many herds then become\r\nmixed together."\r\n\r\n"When your reindeer get mixed with those of other herds, how can you\r\ntell which are yours?" I inquired.\r\n\r\nPehr answered, "Every owner has his own mark branded on the ears of all\r\nhis reindeer, and no other person has the right to use the same, as this\r\nis legal proof of ownership; otherwise, when several herds were mingled\r\ntogether the separation would be impossible. The name of the owner of a\r\nherd, and each mark, have to be recorded in court like those of any\r\nowner of property."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n MOVING CAMP.--ANOTHER GREAT BLIZZARD.--A REMARKABLE SIGHT.--DEER\r\n     GETTING THEIR FOOD BY DIGGING THE SNOW.--HOW REINDEER ARE\r\n     BUTCHERED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day after our conversation about reindeer Pehr Wasara said to\r\nme: "We are going to move away our camp and take our reindeer to a new\r\npasture," an expression that struck me as somewhat singular, as the\r\ncountry lay under snow to the depth of five or six feet. "Some of us are\r\ngoing to fetch the draught animals, and I will be back in a short time."\r\nWith these words he left with some of his people.\r\n\r\nThey returned with a fine lot of trained reindeer.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time there had been a great commotion in the camp; everybody\r\nwas busy; the tent had been packed in two bundles; its frame made three\r\npackages; the frozen reindeer milk, all the provisions, meat, garments,\r\nrobes, skins,--in a word, everything they had was loaded on different\r\nsleighs and secured.\r\n\r\nThe babies were carefully fixed in their queer-looking cradles, and made\r\nquite safe against blustering winds.\r\n\r\nEverything being ready, the reindeer were harnessed and we started. Soon\r\nafter, we came to the herd which had been bunched by the Lapps, the\r\ndogs keeping them together. Then we began our march.\r\n\r\nThe herd moved in advance, in a body. Men, women and children on their\r\nskees moved after them with great rapidity, with their dogs to help them\r\nin the work of keeping the herd together. They all shouted and urged the\r\ndogs to look out, but this required, I thought, no urging, for the dogs\r\nwere on the alert and knew what to do. In the rear were three Lapps with\r\ntheir dogs driving the reindeer forward; the dogs barked behind the\r\nheels of the animals, and once in a while would bite the legs of those\r\nthat did not move fast enough.\r\n\r\nThe women worked just as hard as the men, and those who had babies\r\ncarried them in their cradles, slung on their backs, and went as fast on\r\ntheir skees as if they had been free from burdens. The babies were\r\nevidently very comfortable, for they were very quiet.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine sight to see the herd of over three thousand reindeer on\r\nthe move over the vast plain of snow. After two hours we arrived at the\r\nplace of our encampment.\r\n\r\nThe Lapps hurried the putting up of the tent. The snow had been\r\nshovelled from the place where it was to stand. They were laying the\r\nbirch twigs for a floor, and skins were put on the top of these;\r\nalongside of the tent inside boxes and firewood were placed, and outside\r\nsnow was piled along the sides, also. This was to prevent the wind\r\ncoming in. In the mean time the reindeer had been unharnessed and some\r\nof the sleighs unloaded.\r\n\r\nJust then Pehr Wasara exclaimed: "Paulus, we are going to have a great\r\nwindstorm very soon. That is the reason we are in so much of a hurry."\r\n\r\nHe was right. Soon after the wind began to rise and blew stronger and\r\nstronger, hissing and striking against the tent. In another moment we\r\nwere in the midst of a hurricane. I thought every instant that our tent\r\nwould be blown away and the woollen canvas torn to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe snow was flying thickly in the air. I said to myself: "If our tent\r\nis blown away I will get into my reindeer bags." I was astonished to see\r\nthat the tent could withstand the storm, but the frame was well knit\r\ntogether, and the woollen vadmal being porous allowed the wind to pass\r\nthrough and did not give the resistance that canvas would have done. If\r\nthe tent had been made of canvas I am sure the frame could not have\r\nwithstood the pressure and fury of the blast. The door was protected\r\nfrom the violence of the wind, which struck against the tent on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nThe reindeer had huddled close together and stood still, except that now\r\nand then those which were outside wanted to go inside and let some of\r\nthe other animals bear the brunt of the storm. I noticed that many of\r\nthe bulls formed the outer ring, thus protecting the female reindeer.\r\nThe poor fellows on the outside had a hard time of it. All the herd\r\nfaced the wind.\r\n\r\nInside the tent, when everybody was in, we were packed close together,\r\nincluding the dogs. In spite of all the drawbacks the tent was\r\ncomfortable compared with the weather outside. A blazing fire, over\r\nwhich hung a kettle full of reindeer meat, sent the smoke into our\r\nfaces; but we were thinking of the warm broth and of the good meal we\r\nwere going to have, and we laughed merrily and did not care for the\r\nstorm. The Lapps knew that the tent would stand the hurricane. The dogs\r\nwere in the way of everybody; the Lapps continually drove them out, but\r\nsoon after they were in again.\r\n\r\nHow nice the broth was when we drank it! How good the meat tasted! This\r\nwas a splendid meal.\r\n\r\nWhen it was time to go to sleep I took off my shoes and stockings, and\r\ncarefully put the Lapp grass with the stockings on my breast to dry the\r\nmoisture, for the fine snow came through the smoke hole. Then I got into\r\nmy two bags and said good-night to the family.\r\n\r\nI was bothered by the dogs during the night. They were no sooner driven\r\nout than they would come in to huddle with the people. One tried to come\r\ninto my bag and awoke me. I did not blame the poor dogs, for it was far\r\nmore comfortable inside than outside. When I awoke in the morning the\r\nweather was fine, there was no wind, and some of the Lapps took the\r\nreindeer to their new pasture.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, my host and I drove to see some of his friends who had\r\npitched their tent some forty or fifty miles from us. On our way we\r\nentered a large forest of fir trees, and soon after found ourselves in\r\nthe midst of a number of deep holes dug by reindeer in order to reach\r\nthe moss. We also saw furrows made by Lapp sleighs and tracks of skees.\r\nThe holes increased in number as we got deeper into the forest, and\r\ndriving instead of being a pleasure became a hard task. There was no\r\nmistake about that. Our little sleighs pitched forward, then side-wise,\r\nand rolled on one side or the other. I had the hardest work to keep\r\ninside. At last I was pitched into one of the holes with my sleigh\r\nalmost on top of me. This was no joke. Fortunately I had undone the\r\ntwist of my rein round my wrist, for I did not wish to be dragged\r\nagainst a tree in case I did upset. I was soon in my sleigh again,\r\nhowever, and before long Pehr Wasara said: "We shall come to the tent of\r\nmy friend very soon." He had hardly uttered these words when we heard\r\nthe fierce barking of dogs announcing our arrival. Soon after we found\r\nourselves before a tent.\r\n\r\nThese dogs were strange looking, a breed I had never seen; they had the\r\ndark color of the brown bear, and were without tails. A man came out to\r\nsilence them. He was the owner of the tent, the friend of Pehr Wasara.\r\nHe bade us in, we were made welcome, and the snuffbox was passed around.\r\nCoffee was made and served to us with true Lapp hospitality, but to my\r\ntaste it was seasoned with a little too much salt.\r\n\r\nWe had a grand time. A big kettle filled with reindeer meat was cooked,\r\nand Pehr Wasara told his friend all the news, and how his son had come\r\nwith me to see him. The place of honor was given to us in the tent; we\r\nslept well, under a lot of skins, and the next morning after breakfast\r\nwe bade our host and his family good-bye.\r\n\r\nWe had not been gone long when I saw something very strange ahead. An\r\nexclamation escaped from me. I stopped. I thought I saw the ground\r\ncovered with hares. I could see them moving. "What are such great\r\nnumbers of hares doing here?" I said to myself. They moved in such a\r\nstrange manner; they seemed to jump, or rather leap. Suddenly I saw my\r\nmistake. "These are not hares," I exclaimed; "but the tails of reindeer\r\njust above the snow. That is all I see of their bodies. The rest is\r\nhidden. They have dug the snow and are eating the moss, and their tails\r\nare in motion." I had never seen such a sight before. It was a queer\r\nlandscape; over two thousand tails shaking above the snow at about the\r\nsame time. This herd also belonged to Pehr Wasara, who was smiling all\r\nover when he saw how amazed I was at this sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "They were really working hard for their living."]\r\n\r\nThen we continued our journey, and soon found ourselves in the midst of\r\nhundreds and hundreds of reindeer of all sizes. They were just beginning\r\nto dig the snow with their fore legs. How strange was the sight! As we\r\npassed among them they were not in the least afraid of us. They were\r\nleft to themselves. There were no dogs with them, and no people to\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\nEvery reindeer was working as hard as he could, busily digging in the\r\nsnow. They were evidently hungry. I said to Pehr Wasara: "Let us stay\r\nhere a while; I want to watch the reindeer working." Pehr, who had been\r\naccustomed to see reindeer all his life, wondered at my curiosity, which\r\nseemed rather to amuse him. They dug with the right fore foot, then with\r\nthe left, rested at times, then worked again. It was hard work indeed,\r\nbut the holes got larger and larger. The bodies gradually disappeared in\r\nthe holes they made, and were partly hidden by the little mounds of snow\r\ncoming from these holes, until only the tails of many could be seen.\r\nThey had reached the moss of which they were so fond. They were really\r\nworking hard for their living.\r\n\r\nSome of the female reindeer were working with a will, while the young\r\ndoes were looking on, and when the moss had been reached the mothers\r\ncalled the calves by a peculiar grunt and let them feed by their side.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the reindeer for a while, we continued our journey and\r\nwere completely lost in the midst of deep holes made by the thousands of\r\nreindeer. Wherever we turned we discovered holes and mounds, until we\r\ncame to fresh furrows of sleighs and knew that these led to an\r\nencampment. We had succeeded in getting out of the honeycombed track\r\ninto a smooth and open region.\r\n\r\nAll at once I noticed that Pehr Wasara was going much faster than I did.\r\nI was losing ground. His reindeer seemed now to fly over the snow.\r\nSuddenly he disappeared; he was going down a hill. Now it was the turn\r\nof my reindeer to go fast. I prepared myself for the occasion, for I did\r\nnot know how steep was the descent. I said to myself, "Paul, you must\r\nnot upset; bend your body on the opposite side when the sleigh makes the\r\ncurve, and be quick when the time arrives. Do this in the nick of time."\r\n\r\nDown I went. The animal reached the bottom, and before I knew it made a\r\nsharp curve to prevent the sleigh striking his legs. I gave a shout of\r\njoy. I had not upset. I felt quite proud.\r\n\r\nAt the next hill I was more proud than ever, for Pehr Wasara upset and I\r\ndid not, but I had never seen a Lapp get quicker into a sleigh than he\r\ndid. Further on Pehr stopped and waited for me. When I came to him I\r\nfound myself on the edge of a long and very abrupt hill, and he said:\r\n"This hill is too steep, we must descend it in long zigzags, so that the\r\nsleighs may not strike the legs of our reindeer, for if we do not do\r\nthis the sleigh will go faster than the reindeer. Follow in my track,\r\nand use your stick with skill to guide the sleigh. Your reindeer will\r\nfollow mine without trouble."\r\n\r\nHill after hill was ascended and descended. Now I had got the knack. At\r\nevery sharp curve I managed to bend my body out on the other side in\r\ntime, and thus avoided being thrown out. Then we came to a forest of\r\nlarge fir trees, which surprised me, for we were in 69 degrees latitude.\r\n\r\nThe trees were very thick. Pehr Wasara alighted and led his reindeer,\r\nfor fear of striking against them, and I did likewise. It was a relief\r\nto move one\'s legs, for it is very tiresome to sit for hours with legs\r\nstretched out. Afterwards we got again into our sleighs, and at the end\r\nof a pleasant drive we reached our own tent and I was received with a\r\nhearty welcome by the family.\r\n\r\nThe next day Pehr said to me, "We are going to kill some reindeer this\r\nmorning, for the skins of the animals are at their best now and their\r\nfur is very thick. We want clothing, shoes, and gloves. With their\r\nsinews we will make our thread. We want also new reins, new traces, new\r\nlassos."\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon eight reindeer were brought before the tent. These were\r\nto be slaughtered. My host said to me: "Paulus, we are going to show you\r\nhow we slaughter our reindeer." An old bull was brought forward and one\r\nof the Lapps seized the animal by the antlers, and by a peculiar twist,\r\nwithout apparently great effort, threw him on his back. Then he thrust a\r\nlong, sharp, narrow knife deeply between his forelegs until it pierced\r\nthe heart, where he let it remain. The poor creature rose dazed, turned\r\nround upon himself twice, then tottered and fell dead.\r\n\r\nI did not like the sight, but I was studying the life of the Laplanders\r\nand I had to see everything for myself. After the blood had accumulated\r\nin the cavity of the chest it was removed and put into a bladder. The\r\nintestines were taken out and washed. The skin belonging to the forehead\r\nbetween the eyes, and from the knees to the hoofs, was cut off from the\r\nrest of the hide.\r\n\r\n"This," said Pehr Wasara, "will be for shoes and gloves;" and each piece\r\nwas stretched on wooden frames, likewise the skin of the carcass. The\r\ntongues were set aside, the host saying to me, "If it were summer we\r\nwould smoke them." The sinews were collected for thread.\r\n\r\nThe other reindeer were then butchered, and the meat placed on the racks\r\noutside of the tent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n WATCHING FOR THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE SUN.--THE UPPER RIM FIRST\r\n     VISIBLE.--THE WHOLE ORB SEEN FROM A HILL.--DAYS OF SUNSHINE AHEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nI watched the horizon every day towards noon, hoping to see the sun, for\r\nthe light was getting brighter and brighter. The glow of the hidden sun\r\nwas so great at noon that it looked as if sunrise were going to take\r\nplace. How disappointed I felt when the glow became less and less, as\r\nthe unseen sun sank lower without showing itself. Then came to my mind\r\nthe coast of New Jersey, where in the early morning I had often watched\r\nfor the appearance of the sun above the horizon, in the long glow that\r\npreceded sunrise.\r\n\r\nOne day I saw a golden thread above the snowy horizon. It was the upper\r\nrim of the sun. I watched, hoping to see the whole sun. But it was at\r\nits meridian, and in a very short time the golden thread had disappeared\r\nand the sun was on its downward course. I shouted, "Dear Sun, how much I\r\nshould like to see you. I am so tired of beholding only the stars and\r\nthe moon. I am longing for sunshine."\r\n\r\nNear by was a hill. A sudden thought came into my mind. I said to\r\nmyself, "If I ascend this hill I shall see the whole sun, as the\r\ngreater height will make up for the curvature of the earth."\r\n\r\nI ran, and soon was ascending the hill. After a while I stopped, turned\r\nround, and looked where I had seen the golden thread. I saw about half\r\nthe sun. I climbed higher as fast as I could, and when I reached the top\r\nof the hill I saw the whole sun. I shouted, "Dear Sun, I love you. I\r\nlove sunshine. Come and reign once more on this part of the earth. Come\r\nand cheer me, and drive away the \'Long Night.\'"\r\n\r\nI watched the sun until it disappeared. Oh! I wished the hill had been\r\nhigher so that I could have ascended it and kept seeing the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to the bottom of the hill I said, "I do not wonder that in\r\nancient times there were people who worshipped the sun, for without the\r\nsun we could not exist on the earth, for nothing would grow."\r\n\r\nI felt like a new being, for I had seen the sun and its sight had filled\r\nme with joy. Days of sunshine were coming, and I gave three cheers with\r\na tiger for the sun.\r\n\r\nI had had enough of the "Long Night." I wanted to see a sky without\r\nstars and also the pale moon during the day.\r\n\r\nThe following day the glow above the horizon became more brilliant, and\r\ntowards noon the sun rose slowly above the snow; but only about half of\r\nits body made its appearance. It was of a fiery red. Then it gradually\r\nsank. The third day the whole of the sun appeared above the horizon,\r\nthen in a short time sank below. As it disappeared I imagined the sun\r\nsaying to me: "Day after day I will rise higher and higher in the sky\r\nand shine a longer time. I bring with me joy and happiness. I will\r\ngradually transform \'The Land of the Long Night\' into a land of sunshine\r\nand brightness. I will bring the spring; with me flowers will appear,\r\nthe trees will be adorned with leaves, grass will grow, the land will be\r\ngreen; I will make gentle winds to blow, the rivers will be free and\r\nroll their crystal waters, the birds will come and sing. Man will be\r\nhappy and gather the harvest that grows under my rays and husband it for\r\nthe days of winter."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n WOLVES THE GREAT FOE OF THE LAPPS.--HOW THE REINDEER ARE PROTECTED\r\n     AGAINST THEM.--WATCHING FOR THE TREACHEROUS BRUTES.--STORIES OF\r\n     THEIR SAGACITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the reappearance of the sun I came to a region where the Lapps\r\namong whom I lived were in great fear of wolves, for three packs of them\r\nhad made their appearance in the forests about one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles away to the eastward, and the news had come to the people.\r\n\r\nOne day as I was in the tent watching the meal that was being cooked,\r\none of the Lapps said to me, "We dread the wolves. No animal is as\r\ncunning as a wolf when he is hungry, and the Chief of the Pack is chosen\r\nby them as their leader because he is the most cunning of them all."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean," I asked, "by the Chief of the Pack being chosen?"\r\n\r\nHe replied, "The wolves are very intelligent, and they choose their\r\nleader just as people do. They select the one among them that can lead\r\nthem where there is prey."\r\n\r\nThen he added, with a tone of sadness in his voice: "Our life is one of\r\nconstant vigilance, and old and young are continually on the lookout for\r\nwolves. We have not suffered from them for three years, but they may\r\nappear suddenly at any moment when we think they are far away. When\r\nwolves attack our herds the reindeer scatter in great fright in every\r\ndirection to long distances, and we have very hard work in bringing them\r\ntogether again. When they have once been attacked by the wolves they\r\nbecome very suspicious, and take fright easily, and at the least alarm\r\nrun away. After their flight they roam in small bodies without any one\r\nto watch over them, or dogs to look out for their enemies, and they\r\nbecome an easy prey to the wolves. Sometimes the herd is destroyed, and\r\nthe rich Lapp becomes suddenly poor. Yes," he added with flashing eyes,\r\nand in a loud tone, "the wolves are our greatest enemies. We kill them\r\nwhenever we can."\r\n\r\nHe remained thoughtful for a little while and then proceeded: "Reindeer\r\nbulls have more fight in them than the females, and sometimes fight\r\nsuccessfully one wolf; but what can they do against a pack of them? Our\r\nlife is a hard one indeed when wolves are around, for we have to be\r\nconstantly on the watch night and day. The wolves are so wary that they\r\nalways approach a reindeer or a herd of them when the wind blows from\r\nthe herd towards them, so that neither dogs nor reindeer can scent\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"I hope," I said to myself, "that I shall see bull reindeer fight some\r\nof these treacherous wolves and get the better of them; besides I will\r\nmake them taste my buckshot, and kill them before the poor reindeer is\r\noverpowered."\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation we went on our skees to scour the country for\r\nwolves, but there were none to be seen, and we returned in time for our\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nThe following day, as we stood in front of our tent watching the sun\r\nabove the horizon, we saw in the distance a black speck coming over the\r\nsnow. We watched! What could it be? The speck came nearer, and we\r\nrecognized a woman with a bludgeon coming towards us as fast as her\r\nskees could carry her. As soon as she was within hearing distance she\r\nshouted, "Wolves! Wolves!" The dreaded news had come; the wolves had\r\nmade their appearance in our district.\r\n\r\nShe stopped when she reached us, and with one voice the Lapps asked her\r\nwhen the wolves had been seen, and if they had attacked any herd. "No,"\r\nshe answered, "but they will soon do so, for the tracks of three packs\r\nhave been seen." She had hardly spoken these words when she bade us\r\ngood-bye, and was on her way to some of her family who had pitched their\r\ntent about four miles from where we were. The bludgeon she carried for\r\ndefence against the wolves.\r\n\r\nSoon every man, woman, and child of our tent were on their skees. The\r\nmen armed themselves with heavy bludgeons and guns and, followed by all\r\nthe dogs, we started for the herd, taking a lot of reindeer meat with\r\nus. Now there was to be an increased watch day and night.\r\n\r\nI followed the Lapps on my skees, and though I lagged behind, as I could\r\nnot go as fast as they did, one of the girls remained with me to show me\r\nthe way, and now and then she would stop and scan the country for\r\nwolves.\r\n\r\nI was armed with my double-barrelled shotgun loaded with buckshot. "Oh,\r\nif I could encounter the wolves," I said to myself, "what havoc I would\r\nmake amongst them."\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the herd we told those who were on the watch the news of\r\nthe appearance of wolves. Immediately preparations were made to discover\r\ntheir whereabouts.\r\n\r\nSome of the people went in different directions to reconnoitre, all\r\narmed with their heavy bludgeons. They shouted as they left: "We will\r\nshow the wolves if we meet and chase them on our skees what our\r\nbludgeons can do. We will smash their heads and break their legs."\r\n\r\nTowards dark, when they returned, they had seen no wolves nor their\r\ntracks. "The wolves are so cunning and their ways are so unknown to us\r\nthat we must be on the lookout all night," said the Lapps to me.\r\n\r\nThen we partook of our reindeer meat, which had been kept between our\r\nclothing and our chests to prevent it from freezing. It is not pleasant\r\nto eat a frozen piece of meat as hard as a rock. But I had learned not\r\nto be so very particular. Otherwise I should never have been able to\r\ntravel in the country.\r\n\r\nThe moon was on the wane. When it rose it cast its dim light upon the\r\nsnow. It was a very busy night for the Lapps, for the reindeer had to be\r\nkept together and required constant watching.\r\n\r\nThe dogs acted with great intelligence; they seemed to know that their\r\nmasters dreaded the wolves; they barked continually, and looked once in\r\na while into the distance, moving away, as if to see if they could scent\r\nthe wolves afar off.\r\n\r\nI walked with my skees slowly, looking off into the distance! Suddenly I\r\nthought I saw far away a pack of them. I drew the attention of the Lapp\r\nwho was with me to the spot; but his eyes, accustomed to scan the snow,\r\nsoon discovered what it was. He said to me: "There are no wolves there;\r\nonly the top of some branches of birch trees above the snow."\r\n\r\nAll the Laplanders, men, women, and big boys and girls, remained on\r\ntheir skees all night. The men were outside and made a circle round the\r\nherd. The second circle was made by the women; the third circle, the\r\nnearest to the reindeer, by the children. All shouted and yelled. I\r\nyelled also--I thought it was great fun! The dogs barked as they\r\nfollowed their masters or mistresses, going outside of the ring to look\r\nfor wolves. They were constantly urged; but little urging was required,\r\nfor almost all of them knew from past experience that it meant that the\r\nherd had to be protected from wolves, for they had seen them come when\r\ntheir masters were acting precisely as we were doing, and they were\r\nready for the fray.\r\n\r\nIf it had been a dark night, or if it had been snowing, we should have\r\nbeen in a bad plight; but the moon was our friend. The night passed away\r\nand the wolves had not made their appearance. When daylight came we\r\nwere all pretty tired, and we moved the reindeer nearer to the tent.\r\nThen after the coffee was made and drunk, and some reindeer meat had\r\nbeen eaten, we all huddled the best way we could into the tent, covered\r\nourselves with skins, and soon after fell asleep, leaving the care of\r\nthe reindeer to those who were on the watch and to the dogs--their\r\nuntiring and faithful friends.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke, three dogs were fast asleep near me--the dear dogs\r\nrequired rest as well as ourselves; they had worked hard for their\r\nmasters all night. I remembered the time we had had during the night,\r\nand said to myself, "Hard, indeed, is the life of the Laplander." The\r\nreindeer lay on the snow. After breakfast they were taken a short\r\ndistance to pasture, and those who had slept watched them, ready to\r\nfight the wolves if they came.\r\n\r\nThe news had spread quickly among the Lapps in the district that wolves\r\nmight make their appearance at any moment, and several families with\r\ntheir tents came to camp near us and their herds were kept near ours for\r\nmutual protection. We were numerous enough to fight a great number of\r\nhungry wolves, and the country was scoured in every direction.\r\n\r\nNumbers of juniper-brush fires were lighted at night where we had\r\ncleared away the snow to scare off the wolves.\r\n\r\nThat evening the Lapps told wolf stories. One began thus:\r\n\r\n"When wolves have lost the Chief of the Pack, they hold a council and\r\nname another Chief, who they expect will lead them safely through their\r\nwanderings and direct them when an attack is to be made. The wolves\r\nunderstand each other perfectly well, and they obey the Chief of the\r\nPack. They often speak to each other with their eyes. This appears\r\nwonderful, but it is so. But woe to the Chief when the wolves become\r\ndissatisfied with him. When they find that under his leadership they are\r\nconstantly starving, they agree among themselves to destroy him. They\r\nthen pounce upon him, kill him, and devour him. They have a way of\r\nagreeing to do this without their Chief knowing what is to happen to\r\nhim. They pass judgment upon him and sentence him to die."\r\n\r\n"Wonderful indeed," I said, "is the intelligence of the wolves, if what\r\nyou say is true."\r\n\r\n"It is true," said the narrator, and the rest with one voice confirmed\r\nhim. "Wolves are as knowing as people, and we know some of their cunning\r\nways. The Chief of the Pack must often lead the wolves on long marches,\r\nthrough forests and unbeaten tracks, over the snow to some place where\r\nhe supposes they will find prey. Besides he must not lead them into\r\nambush where they may be destroyed. The Chief must be not only cunning,\r\nbut brave also. We see them often, after they have discovered us, going\r\naway or taking another direction than the one in which they were going.\r\nIt is simply to deceive us, to make us believe that they are going\r\naway. Then they make a long detour and take our reindeer in our rear.\r\nPeople say foxes are cunning, but the cunning of a fox is nothing to\r\ncompare to the cunning of a wolf."\r\n\r\n"That is so," repeated all the Lapps.\r\n\r\nAnother man said: "When the Chief of the Pack becomes old, and is not\r\nable to lead the wolves any more, the wolves kill him and eat him. When\r\ntwo packs meet there is often a great fight between the two chiefs for\r\nthe mastery, and the defeated one runs away. Then his own pack over\r\nwhich he ruled runs after him and kills him. Then they proclaim the\r\nvictor the new Chief and the two packs join forces. Often, when the\r\nwolves make an attack, the Chief looks on with a few of his followers as\r\na reserve to see how things are going, and then rushes in with them to\r\ninsure victory."\r\n\r\nAfter this story the Lapps lighted their pipes and puffed away. Then one\r\npassed his snuffbox round, each taking a pinch of snuff. I took one, and\r\nI had immediately a fit of sneezing that lasted quite a while, to the\r\ngreat amusement of my Lapp friends. One of the latter then told the\r\nfollowing story:\r\n\r\n"Some winters ago, while a number of us were on skees on our way to\r\nchurch, which was about one hundred miles away, we saw in the distance\r\nquite a number of wolves, following the Chief of the Pack. He was easily\r\nrecognized, not only because he seemed larger than the others, but\r\nbecause he was always in the lead, and when he stopped they did\r\nlikewise. It was fortunate that we were on skees instead of in sleighs,\r\nfor the reindeer would have become unmanageable in their fright and\r\nwould certainly have been attacked by the wolves. We were armed with our\r\nbludgeons, and three of us had guns. The wolves, which had seen us, came\r\nin our direction and when at about a quarter of a mile from us stopped\r\nand suddenly held a consultation, then advanced again towards us. When\r\nthey had come within shooting distance I aimed with my gun at the Chief\r\nof the Pack, who stood by himself, and killed him. Immediately the other\r\nwolves precipitated themselves upon him and fought over his body and\r\ndevoured him. In the mean time we shot two others. Those likewise were\r\ndevoured by their comrades. It did not take the wolves much time to\r\ndevour their three companions. It was done in the twinkling of an eye.\r\nThe wolves were so voracious because they had not eaten for several\r\ndays. This is the time when they follow men and sometimes attack them\r\nwhen they are a large pack together.\r\n\r\n"The other wolves made off, cowed by the death of their three comrades,\r\nbut soon stopped and held a consultation among themselves again, and\r\nsoon we saw one among them take the lead. This was the new Chief of the\r\nPack that had been chosen by them. Then they walked towards us again,\r\nand we were ready to meet them on our skees. Our object was to kill this\r\nnew Chief of the Pack. I aimed at him and succeeded in killing him also.\r\nHe had hardly fallen when he was set upon and devoured. Now the\r\nappetite of the wolves was more or less satisfied, and after we had\r\nkilled another they fled as they saw him fall; once in a while they\r\nlooked back towards us, but having no chief they did not know what to do\r\nuntil they had chosen another--and they disappeared in the distance."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n IN SEARCH OF WOLVES.--A LARGE PACK.--THEY HOLD A CONSULTATION.--THEIR\r\n     FIERCE ATTACK ON THE REINDEER.--PURSUING THEM ON SKEES.--KILLING\r\n     THE CHIEF OF THE PACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day a great snowstorm swept over the land, and during that\r\ntime the Lapps were much in fear that prowling wolves would get into the\r\nmidst of their herds and that we should be unable to see them on account\r\nof the storm.\r\n\r\nWhen the snowstorm was over, the Lapps said to me: "We are going to\r\nscour the country for miles around and look out for wolves, for now is a\r\ngood time to hunt them because the snow is soft. They sink into it as\r\nthey run, and we can go much faster than they do on our skees, and so\r\novertake them and fell them with our bludgeons." And they asked if I\r\nwould accompany them.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied, without hesitation, and added, "I hope we shall meet\r\nwolves."\r\n\r\nThe Lapps left by twos and threes and went in different directions. One\r\nof them and myself took our way directly east.\r\n\r\nAfter travelling a few miles I espied a black speck very far away, for I\r\nam long-sighted. This at first I thought to be the top of birch trees\r\nabove the snow, as before; but I was not quite sure, and as I walked\r\nalong on my skees I kept a sharp lookout. Suddenly I thought the black\r\nspot was moving. I stopped and watched. There was no mistake, the spot\r\nwas moving. It was a large pack of wolves. And they were apparently\r\ncoming towards us. I called to my companion, and pointing to the spot\r\nsaid to him: "Look there. I think I see wolves." He looked for a while,\r\nthen with glittering eyes he said, "Paulus, you are right; they are\r\nwolves."\r\n\r\nWe stood still to watch them. The spot was getting bigger and bigger as\r\nthe wolves came nearer. They made a large pack; but they were still too\r\nfar away for us to be able to guess how many there were. I wondered if\r\nthey were coming to attack us. They certainly would if they had had no\r\nfood for several days, for hunger makes them very bold and fierce.\r\n\r\nI looked at my gun. It was all right. My pouch was filled with buckshot\r\ncartridges. My hunting knife hung by my side. My Lapp held his bludgeon\r\ntightly in his hands. No wolf could run as fast as he could when he was\r\non his skees, and he could run away from them if he was not equal to the\r\ncontest and if there were too many after him.\r\n\r\n"The wolves have perhaps scented the reindeer," said he; "they have to\r\ncome in our direction to reach the herds."\r\n\r\nNot far from where we stood was a big boulder that was not entirely\r\nburied in the snow. "Let us hide behind it, and watch," said my\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nAfter we had come to the boulder, the Lapp hid at one end of it, I at\r\nthe other. From our hiding-place we could peep out and keep a sharp\r\nlookout on the wolves.\r\n\r\nThe wolves were coming nearer and nearer. I tried to count them, and I\r\nthought there were about thirty. I soon recognized the Chief of the\r\nPack. He was bigger and appeared darker than the rest. He was walking\r\nquite ahead of all the pack. They seemed to become more cautious as they\r\nneared us. What was the reason? We held a consultation. The Lapp said,\r\n"The wind has shifted and is blowing from the wolves towards us, so they\r\ncannot scent us, and it is by mere chance they are coming in this\r\ndirection. They have evidently come from the great Finland forest east\r\nof us."\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Chief of the Pack stopped, and all the wolves stopped also.\r\nThen he advanced alone slowly while the remainder of the pack stood\r\nstill. Then the wolves came to join him. They were now evidently holding\r\na consultation, talking wolf fashion among themselves, or listening to\r\ntheir Chief, who had something to say. "What are the wolves up to?" I\r\ninquired of the Lapp.\r\n\r\n"They are planning some mischief," he replied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "The Lapp passed him like a flash and gave him a terrible\r\nblow."]\r\n\r\nThen they divided themselves into two packs, the old Chief having the\r\ngreater number of wolves with him. The new pack with its Chief turned to\r\nthe right, the ones with the old Chief remaining at the same place. I\r\nsaid to the Lapp, "How strange is the wolves\' behavior! Apparently the\r\nlong conversation they had among themselves was to arrange a plan of\r\ncampaign and to divide themselves into two packs."\r\n\r\n"That is so," replied he. "Wolves are very knowing, and by their tactics\r\nfool us very often."\r\n\r\nI replied, "We will try to fool them this time, and kill many of them.\r\nThe reindeer must be protected."\r\n\r\n"I believe," continued the Lapp, "that the new pack that has left is\r\ngoing to take our reindeer in the rear and attack them, and those which\r\nremain here are going to wait for this attack. The reindeer in their\r\nfright will run in the opposite direction and fall into the midst of\r\nthese wolves that we see, and which are waiting for them. The cunning of\r\nwolves is wonderful. When a pack attacks a herd of reindeer there are\r\nalways some of them lying in wait somewhere else.\r\n\r\n"You stay here and watch. I must go and warn our people that the wolves\r\nhave come among us. We have been expecting them every hour. It is very\r\nseldom when their tracks are seen that they do not attack our reindeer.\r\nI will return very soon."\r\n\r\n"All right," I said. I had plenty of buckshot, and with my back to the\r\nboulder I was not afraid of being attacked in the rear, and I could face\r\nthem without fear, fire at them, and kill a number of them.\r\n\r\nAfter the Lapp had gone I watched the pack carefully. The wolves stood\r\nstill for a long time. They were looking in a certain direction. I tried\r\nto find what they were looking at, but saw nothing. Suddenly they\r\nadvanced, turning away slightly from the boulder, then walked faster,\r\nheaded by the Chief of the Pack. There seemed to be great excitement\r\namong them. I looked in the direction whither they were moving, when I\r\nsaw a lot of reindeer coming towards them, pursued by wolves from behind\r\nand Lapps and dogs following them. What the Lapp had said had come to\r\npass; the wolves had attacked the reindeer in the rear, and the pack\r\nthat had stood still was ready for the fray and to attack them in front.\r\nI was also prepared for the fight--ready to kill all the wolves I could.\r\n\r\nNow I saw reindeer in every direction--wolves among them, and the Lapps\r\neverywhere, moving at great speed on their skees. They seemed to fly\r\nover the snow. Suddenly I saw one coming near a wolf which was running\r\nafter a reindeer, and passing by his side give with his bludgeon a blow\r\nthat broke the back of the beast, which gave a fearful howl. In the mean\r\ntime the Lapp wheeled round, came back, and finished him by a blow on\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nI saw further on a poor reindeer in his death struggle with two wolves\r\nthat had fastened upon his neck. Two Lapps had seen this also, and armed\r\nwith their bludgeons they came at full speed, and as quick as the flight\r\nof an arrow they passed on each side of the poor reindeer and broke the\r\nfore legs of the wolves, which fell on their backs howling. The Lapps\r\nwheeled round, returned and gave them two terrific blows on their heads,\r\nwhich stunned them; then they killed them. I had heard the sound of the\r\nblows.\r\n\r\nThe wolves had become very fierce in their attacks. I wanted to pursue\r\nthem on my skees, but unfortunately I was not skilful enough to do so.\r\nThe reindeer were fleeing, pursued by the wolves which were in their\r\nmidst. It was a fight for life. I saw four wolves attacking a bull while\r\nhe was charging one of them and had almost pierced him with his antlers.\r\nThe three other wolves sprang upon him, their big teeth in his flesh. He\r\nran with them for a while, then the noble animal fell.\r\n\r\nAnother wolf came near me and succeeded in bringing down a young\r\nreindeer that was running away with all his might. I sent a lot of\r\nbuckshot through him and killed him on the spot, but I was too late to\r\nsave the life of the poor reindeer; and in an instant the dying wolf was\r\nattacked by his voracious comrades, which precipitated themselves upon\r\nhim and tore him to pieces and devoured him. I looked at this scene with\r\nso much astonishment that I forgot to fire another shot at the wolves.\r\n\r\nSeveral wolves were killed, and at last all were put to flight. Our\r\nvictory was complete. I recognized the Chief of the Pack among the\r\nslain. What a big fellow he was! What ugly-looking teeth he had! The\r\nwolves after this attack were completely disorganized, and fled in\r\ndifferent directions.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time my Lapp, true to his word, had rejoined me. He said:\r\n"These wolves understand each other, and have agreed among themselves to\r\nmeet somewhere in the great forest east of us. They will visit us again\r\nin small packs, so we must be on the watch constantly." Then with a sigh\r\nhe said: "Now we are going to have a hard time to bring the reindeer of\r\neach owner together."\r\n\r\nThe day after the slaying of the wolves, I bade good-bye to the Lapps\r\nand once more started to wander over the great snowy waste of "The Land\r\nof the Long Night."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "It was a fight for life!"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n GREAT SKILL OF THE LAPPS WITH THEIR SKEES.--LEAPING OVER WIDE GULLIES\r\n     AND RIVERS.--PRODIGIOUS LENGTH OF THEIR LEAPS.--ACCURACY OF THEIR\r\n     COASTING.--I START THEM BY WAVING THE AMERICAN FLAG.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was once more travelling westward, and two days afterward fell in with\r\nanother company of nomadic Lapps. We became, as usual, good friends.\r\n\r\nOne day they said to me: "Paulus, the snow is in a very fine condition\r\nfor skeeing, and we are going to have some fun among ourselves, and run\r\ndown steep hills on our skees and try our skill in making leaps in the\r\nair across a chasm there is over yonder, with a river beyond, and find\r\nout who can make the longest leap and be the champion. We want you to\r\ncome with us, for there will be great fun."\r\n\r\nI replied, "I am certainly coming, for I have never seen such a game\r\nbefore, and I like fun. Yes, boys, I like fun." They laughed heartily\r\nwhen they heard me say this.\r\n\r\nWe made ready, and started on our skees, and after a run of about four\r\nmiles the Lapps stopped near the edge of a long and very steep hill, at\r\nthe foot of which was a plain.\r\n\r\nThere they said to me: "There is a wide gully, which you cannot see,\r\nbefore reaching the bottom of the hill, and further down is a river. We\r\nwill go down this hill and leap over both the gully and the river on our\r\nskees. Of course, the greater our speed, the longer the leap we make.\r\nThe danger is in not being able to reach the ledge on the other side;\r\nbut this makes the fun more exciting. It is very seldom, however, that\r\naccidents happen, for no one undertakes these dangerous leaps unless he\r\nis very sure of himself."\r\n\r\n"What happens then," I asked, "if the leap falls short?"\r\n\r\n"Then," he answered, "you may break your leg, or arm, or your neck; but\r\nI do not know of any such misfortunes happening, though we hear once in\r\na great while in the mountains of an accident which results in death.\r\nOne of the great dangers in skeeing is that of striking a boulder hidden\r\nunder the crust of snow, or of falling over an unseen precipice. When we\r\nare small children we learn to leap forward in the air and come down on\r\nour skees, beginning by making small leaps from insignificant heights,\r\nincreasing the leap gradually as we have more practice, and so becoming\r\nstronger and more agile and skilful in going down a hill."\r\n\r\nThereupon the Lapps took up their position along the brink of the hill\r\nand stood in a straight line about ten or fifteen yards from each other.\r\nIt was a fine sight. At a given signal they started on their skees,\r\nholding in one hand their sticks to be used as rudders to guide them.\r\nThey slid down at tremendous speed; suddenly I saw them fly through the\r\nair, and then land below on their skees. They had leaped over the gully.\r\nThen they continued their course faster than before, on account of the\r\nmomentum of the leap, and as they reached the bottom of the hill they\r\nmade another leap in the air, which took them over the river to the\r\nplain beyond. After going a little further, for they could not stop at\r\nonce, they came to a halt. Then returning they examined the leaps, to\r\nsee who among them had made the longest one.\r\n\r\nAfter they had ascertained who was the champion in the first contest,\r\nthey continued to ascend the hill in zigzags on their skees, and after\r\nthis tiresome task they came to where they had left me.\r\n\r\nI said to them, "Friends, I am going down the hill, for I shall then be\r\nable to see better your great leaping feats, and how wide and deep is\r\nthe space you leap over, for from the top of the hill it cannot be seen.\r\nWonderful, indeed, are your skill and daring! Such tremendous leaps as\r\nyou made can never be accomplished by man except on skees. I wish I\r\ncould have been brought up to go on skees like yourselves, from my\r\nchildhood, then I should enjoy this greatly, and compete for the\r\nchampionship. It is far better fun than skating." "Certainly," they\r\nshouted with one voice, "there is ten times more fun in skeeing than in\r\nskating. It is like all sports, the more danger there is in them the\r\ngreater are the excitement and the interest."\r\n\r\n"But," said I, "I must go down this hill in a roundabout way, for I do\r\nnot want to fall into the hollow over which you leaped."\r\n\r\n"It would not hurt you," they cried; "you would find plenty of snow at\r\nthe bottom if you should fall in." It was agreed that one of the Lapps\r\nshould go with me and show me the way through a less steep descent to\r\nthe chasm. We made the descent successfully, and came to a good position\r\nfrom which I could see the men make the great leap.\r\n\r\nLooking up, I saw all the Lapps in position ready for the descent and\r\nwaiting for the raising of the little American flag I always carried\r\nwith me,--a custom which dates from the time of my travels in Africa--as\r\nthe signal to start. As I unfolded it, I kissed it with great affection.\r\nHow beautiful the stars and stripes looked as they waved in the breeze\r\nand over the snow!\r\n\r\nAt this signal the Lapps started. Suddenly I noticed that one of\r\nthem--the last one in the row--bore down directly upon me. "Goodness!" I\r\nsaid to my companion, pointing out to him the Lapp above, "suppose this\r\nman as he comes down should happen to strike me."\r\n\r\nThe Lapp heard me with a smile, and replied: "Paulus, do not be afraid;\r\nhe will guide his skees as skilfully as a skilful boatman steers his\r\nboat. I think perhaps he intends to touch you with his hands as he\r\npasses by you, so do not be frightened; do not move an inch; he is one\r\nof the most skilful among us."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Suddenly I saw them fly through the air."]\r\n\r\nHe had hardly finished these words when the Lapp with railroad speed\r\nand dangerously close bore down upon me, and before I could realize it\r\npassed in front of me within three feet, without however touching me, as\r\nmy companion had predicted. Still it took my breath away; my heart beat\r\nso quickly. Down he went. Before I had time to recover I saw the Lapps\r\nin the air, over the chasm, then in the twinkling of an eye they had\r\nalighted on the other side. Their momentum was very great, and in less\r\nthan a minute they had leaped over the river, and continued their\r\nforward course, which they could not stop, on the plain below; then\r\nlessened their speed gradually with the help of their sticks, the ends\r\nof which were thrust deep in the snow.\r\n\r\nIt was a grand sight. As they leaped over their legs were somewhat bent,\r\nand as they struck the snow they righted themselves. While in the air\r\nthey maintained their skees parallel, as if they had been on the snow,\r\nand when they alighted the skees were on a perfect level with each\r\nother; no man seemed to be more than two or three feet ahead of another.\r\n\r\nI had followed their motions with great curiosity. They seemed to give a\r\nspring as they came near the brink of the chasm, bending their bodies\r\nforward, straightening themselves as they struck the snow, and\r\ncontinuing their way as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nOn their way back, as they neared me I shouted, "Good for you, boys!\r\nGood for you! It was splendid." I shook hands with every one of them.\r\nThey were very much excited over the sport.\r\n\r\nThe hollow over which they leaped seemed to be about ninety-five feet\r\nwide, and the place from which they sprang was about twelve or fifteen\r\nfeet above the bank on the other side. They told me that some of the\r\ngreat leaps in the country had been over one hundred and twenty-five\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible!" I exclaimed; "it seems incredible."\r\n\r\nThen the Lapp who had passed so near me said to me, "You were afraid I\r\nwould strike you on my way down. We can pass an object far below us\r\nwithin a few inches when we like. We will show you how we do by and by."\r\n\r\nThe Lapps once more ascended the hill, and I took a new position by the\r\nriver and waited for them to come down. They started in the same way as\r\nbefore and came down with very great speed, leaped over the gully, and\r\nin an instant, seemingly, they were in the air over the river--a leap of\r\nabout sixty or seventy feet.\r\n\r\nI shouted again, "Well done, boys! Well done!" I was terribly excited\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nThen they came to me and said: "Now we are going to have a new game."\r\nThey planted several sticks in the snow in different positions on the\r\ndeclivity of the hill, and said, "Paulus, we are going to show you how\r\nnear we can come to those sticks; we will almost touch them with our\r\nskees."\r\n\r\nWhen they were ready I raised my flag. They came down the hill almost\r\nwith the same rapidity as before, but pushed their guiding sticks deeper\r\ninto the snow; and most of them came within a few inches of the sticks.\r\n\r\nAfter passing one they would change their direction and move to another,\r\neither on the left or right, further down.\r\n\r\nThis terminated the day\'s sport. We returned to our encampment. I had\r\nhad a day of great delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n WE ENCOUNTER MORE WOLVES.--MY GUIDE KILLS TWO WITH HIS BLUDGEON.--A\r\n     VISITING TRIP WITH A LAPP FAMILY.--EXTRAORDINARY SPEED OF\r\n     REINDEER.--WE STRIKE A BOULDER.--LAKE GIVIJ\xc3\x84RVI.--EASTWARD AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I kept a sharp lookout over the horizon as we drove along, for I\r\nthought wolves might make their appearance again at any moment. My Lapp\r\nguide was also apprehensive.\r\n\r\nWhen we stopped for our meals he said to me, "If our reindeer scent or\r\nsee wolves, they will become uncontrollable. It will be impossible for\r\nus to stop them, and if we try to keep in our sleighs we shall be surely\r\nupset, for the animals will be so wild from fright. We had better have\r\nour skees handy, so that we can throw them out of our sleighs and then\r\njump out ourselves."\r\n\r\nThen, brandishing his bludgeon, he said fiercely, "I will make short\r\nwork of some of them. They will never run after any more reindeer."\r\n\r\nI brandished my gun, and cried, "Woe to the wolves if they come near us.\r\nI will give them enough buckshot to make them jump."\r\n\r\nWe continued our journey, the Lapp keeping close to me. Suddenly he\r\nstopped and said, "Paulus, I am going to tie your sleigh behind mine\r\nand fasten your reindeer to it. I do not know why, but I have an idea,\r\nsomehow, that there are wolves around, and I expect to see them at any\r\nmoment. At any rate it is better to be prepared for them."\r\n\r\nAfter my sleigh was attached as he had said, we resumed our journey, I,\r\nquietly seated in my sleigh, having no reindeer to drive, only using my\r\nstick as a rudder. About two hours afterwards as we skirted a forest of\r\nfir trees we suddenly saw two wolves skulking in the distance.\r\nFortunately we discovered them before the reindeer did. We threw out our\r\nskees, and then the Lapp with his bludgeon and I with my gun jumped out.\r\nWe were hardly out when our reindeer scented the wolves and plunged\r\nwildly in their efforts to escape, and we had to let them go, for we\r\ncould not hold them.\r\n\r\nThe Lapp in an instant was on his skees armed with his bludgeon. He made\r\ndirectly for the wolves at tremendous speed. He seemed to fly over the\r\nsnow, and before I knew it he had slain a wolf by giving him a mighty\r\nblow on his skull. Then like a bird of prey he made for the other wolf.\r\nThe animal stood still, ready to bite him, but the Lapp passed by him\r\nlike a flash and gave him a terrible blow on his mouth which broke his\r\nteeth. Then after he had stopped the speed of his skees, he turned back\r\nand gave him his deathblow.\r\n\r\nAfter he had taken breath, he said to me, "Paulus, wait here, for you\r\ncannot \'skee\' fast enough. I must go after our runaway reindeer and our\r\nsleighs," and off he went. He followed the tracks they had left behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI waited one hour, two hours,--I thought he would never come back.\r\nFinally I saw a little black speck over the snow. It was my Lapp, and\r\nsoon he was by my side with reindeer and sleighs.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we came to a tent, where we were kindly received, and\r\nthere we slept. The next morning the owner of the tent said to me, "The\r\nsnow is very fine for sleighing, for it is crisp and well packed. The\r\nweather is cold and travelling with reindeer could not be better, for\r\nthe animals will feel fine. Some of my people and I want to go and visit\r\nmy brother and his family. Will you come with us?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied, "I shall be very glad to go with you."\r\n\r\nA short time after this five reindeer made their appearance; they were\r\nall males, and splendid animals,--Samoyeds, the finest and largest I had\r\nthus far seen. Their antlers were superb.\r\n\r\n"These reindeer," said their owner, "are the fastest I have, and are in\r\ntheir prime for driving, for they are between six and eight years old,\r\nthe age when they are the strongest. They have not been used for two\r\nweeks, so they feel very frisky; and it being so cold they will run at a\r\nrate that will perhaps scare you, and I am sure they will go as fast as\r\nthey ever did. No reindeer that I know of can keep pace with them. I\r\nhave taken great care in training them."\r\n\r\nI was delighted at the thought of travelling with such fast animals, and\r\nI replied, "I am sure I shall enjoy the drive."\r\n\r\nThen everybody got ready for the start. My host, pointing to one of the\r\nbiggest reindeer, said to me, "This one will be yours, and you will\r\nfollow me."\r\n\r\nWe were hardly ready when the reindeer started at a furious rate and in\r\nthe wildest way. The Lapps held their reins as hard as they could and\r\nthrew themselves across their sleighs and were carried in that way for a\r\nlittle distance. It was a most ludicrous sight, the like of which I had\r\nnever seen! But they all succeeded in getting in--they were masters of\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nHow they succeeded in getting in I could not tell, it was certainly a\r\ngreat feat of gymnastics. My reindeer had started with the rest and was\r\nahead of them all, but soon the Lapps overtook me.\r\n\r\nWe went on at a tremendous rate. These were indeed the fastest reindeer\r\nI had ever travelled with. It was a good thing that I had learned how to\r\nbalance myself in those little Lapp sleighs. I did not mind any more\r\ntheir swinging to and fro. I rather liked the excitement. And it was\r\nexciting enough! We went so fast that things appeared and disappeared\r\nalmost before I had time to look at them.\r\n\r\nWe sped with such rapidity that I fancied I was travelling on the\r\nPennsylvania railroad, as I often had done on the Limited to Chicago on\r\nthe way to see my Scandinavian friends and others. I was thinking of\r\nthat splendid train with its luxurious cars--of the observation cars\r\nwith their comfortable chairs, sofas, library; of the bath room,\r\nstenographer, and barber, and polite employees, and all the comforts\r\ntravellers had. Suddenly I thought of its fine dining-room cars, and as\r\nI was hungry I imagined I was seated before one of its tables, with\r\nsnowy-white linen, and enjoying a glorious meal,--oysters, capon, roast\r\nbeef, vegetables of several kinds, and puddings and fruits; the ice\r\ncream I dismissed, for I did not feel like having any, it was so cold.\r\nThen I thought of its comfortable beds--when suddenly a tremendous\r\nbumping, which almost threw me out, reminded me that I was not on that\r\nluxurious train. I had struck a snag or boulder. This made it clear at\r\nonce that I was dreaming and was not on the Chicago Limited, but that I\r\nwas travelling in "The Land of the Long Night."\r\n\r\nThe air was so rarefied, the drive so exciting, that I shouted with all\r\nmy might, "Go on, reindeer, go on. This is fine, I never had such a\r\ndrive in my life."\r\n\r\nAfter two hours, and a drive of nearly fifty miles, we alighted before a\r\nLapp tent. The dogs, and there were many, announced our arrival by\r\nfierce barking, and the inmates of the tent came out to see who the\r\nstrangers were. They recognized my friends and received them with\r\ndemonstrations of joy, which was the more remarkable as the Lapps are\r\nfar from being demonstrative.\r\n\r\nThe next day in the afternoon we returned to our tent, the reindeer as\r\nfrisky as the day before and running as fast. I have never forgotten\r\nthose two glorious rides, and I shall remember them as long as I live.\r\n\r\nBidding my Lapp friends good-bye I came one day to Lake Givij\xc3\xa4rvi and\r\nfurther on to Lake Aitij\xc3\xa4rvi. There I saw a lonely farm with a\r\ncomfortable dwelling-house of logs. How pleasant this habitation seemed\r\nin that snow land. The smoke curling over the chimney told that there\r\nwere people there, and soon after we were in front of the house, and I\r\nentered a large room, and saw a man with long black shaggy hair tinged\r\nwith grey. His name was Adam Triump. Then a woman, his wife, came in,\r\nalso with loose shaggy black hair falling over her shoulders. My guide\r\nand I were made welcome.\r\n\r\nFrom there I travelled once more eastward, driving over the Ivalajoki,\r\nwhich falls into the Enarej\xc3\xa4rvi. If I had been travelling alone I should\r\ncertainly have perished, for I did not know where to find the people of\r\nthe thinly inhabited country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n THE LAPP HAMLET OF KAUTOKEINO.--A BATH IN A BIG IRON POT.--AN ARCTIC WAY\r\n     OF WASHING CLOTHES.--DRESS AND ORNAMENTS OF THE LAPPS.--APPEARANCE\r\n     AND HEIGHT OF THE LAPPS.--GIVIJ\xc3\x84RVI.--KARASJOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after the events I have just related to you, I found myself\r\nin the Lapp hamlet of Kautokeino, with its Lutheran church, near\r\nlatitude 69 degrees. Here and there were queer-looking storehouses which\r\nbelonged to the nomadic Lapps. I alighted before the post station, and\r\nentered the house and was welcomed by the station master. The dwelling\r\nwas composed of two rooms, one for the use of the family, the other for\r\nguests or travellers. The place was full of Lapp men and women who had\r\ncome to rest, go to church on the following Sunday, or see their\r\nchildren who were at school; or to get coffee, sugar, and other\r\nprovisions stored in their own houses.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the post station was the cow house, and between\r\nit and the house was the old-fashioned wooden-bucket well with its long,\r\nswinging pole, surrounded by a thick mass of ice made of the dripping\r\nwater from the bucket. I did not wonder when I saw the ice, for it was\r\n43 degrees below zero that day, and sometimes it is colder still.\r\n\r\nI went into the cow-house. It was, as usual, a very low building, lower\r\nthan most of those I had seen before. The two long windows admitted a\r\ndim light. At the further end was the usual big iron pot seen in almost\r\nevery cow-house, for soaking the grass in boiling water, as the coarse\r\nmarsh grass is so hard to chew that it has to be thus prepared. The\r\ndaughter of the house, a girl about twenty years old, said to me, "I am\r\ngoing to prepare a meal for the cows and the sheep."\r\n\r\nThe huge iron pot was filled with reindeer moss and grass and warm\r\nwater. "This food is for the cows and sheep," she said. "The horse is\r\nfed on fine fragrant hay, gathered during the short summer; horses will\r\nnot eat the food we give to the cows and sheep; they are very\r\nparticular."\r\n\r\nI was very much in need of a good wash and of a warm bath, for I had\r\nonly used snow to wash my hands and face for many days. As I looked at\r\nthe big iron pot I said to myself, "This pot will make a good wash-tub."\r\n\r\nI went to the mistress of the house and asked her if I could take a warm\r\nbath in the big iron pot. "Certainly," she replied. Then she called her\r\ndaughter, and both went to the cow-house. They cleaned the iron pot\r\nthoroughly; then filled it about two thirds full with water from the\r\ntrough communicating with the well, which the old station master drew\r\nfor them. They lighted a fire under the pot, and cleaned the\r\nsurroundings, and laid down a reindeer skin for my feet, and a chair for\r\nme to sit on.\r\n\r\nWhen the water was warm, and the fire under it extinguished, the wife\r\nsaid that my bath was ready.\r\n\r\nHow good I felt when I was in the big iron pot filled with warm water. I\r\ngave grunts of satisfaction. I put my head under water and thought "How\r\ngood; how good the water feels."\r\n\r\nSuddenly one of the family appeared, and before I had time to say "What\r\ndo you want?" had jumped into the water all dressed and got hold of one\r\nof my legs and rubbed it with soap. Then came the turn of the other leg,\r\nthen the body, head and all. I was rubbed with a brush as hard as if I\r\nhad been a piece of wood that had no feelings, and as if my skin had\r\nbeen the bark of a tree. Two or three times I screamed out, but my\r\nattendant only laughed. After the rubbing I was switched with birch\r\ntwigs till I fairly glowed, and then I was left alone. When I looked at\r\nmy body my skin was as red as a tomato. The blood was in full\r\ncirculation and I felt fine, for it was such a long time since I had\r\ntaken a real bath that I had almost forgotten that there was such a\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nHow nice it was to put clean underwear on. How comfortable it felt. I\r\nput on a new pair of reindeer trousers, that were lent to me and that\r\nhad never been worn before, and a new "kapta." Here was a good occasion\r\nto have my underwear washed, and my fur garments cleansed of everything,\r\nfor it was over 40 degrees below zero. This wearing of the same clothes\r\nfor a long time is the greatest hardship of travelling in winter in the\r\nArctic regions; for in the course of time obnoxious things swarm in the\r\nfur and also in the woollen underwear. When these become unendurable the\r\nfollowing way of washing has to be performed without soap or water.\r\n\r\nAfter a person has changed his fur garments and underwear, he hangs them\r\noutside when the temperature is from 20 to 50 degrees below zero. The\r\ncolder it is, the better for the clothes that are to be cleansed. These\r\nare left hanging for several days, during which time all the noxious\r\nthings are killed by the intense cold. After this the underwear and the\r\nfur garments are well shaken and beaten, and then they return from this\r\nkind of laundry clean, according to the views of the Arctic regions, and\r\nare ready to be worn again. I often had my clothing washed in that\r\nmanner, and also my sleeping-bags.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday many Lapps attended the Lutheran church from different parts\r\nof the country, coming either on skees or with their sleighs; those who\r\nlived far away starting the day before. Some had come even so far as one\r\nhundred and fifty miles. I was present at the religious services; the\r\nchurch was crowded. The clergyman was not in his clerical robes, but\r\ndressed in furs--like the rest of the congregation, for the churches are\r\nnot heated.\r\n\r\nOn my return from church, the Lapps asked me where I was going. I\r\nreplied I wanted to go as far as the land went north of me, as far as\r\nNordkyn. They all wondered why I wanted to go there. They asked me if I\r\nwas a merchant and bought fish. I told them I was not, but that I\r\ntravelled to see the country and its people. They thought I was a very\r\nstrange man, and they wondered at my ways.\r\n\r\nThis hamlet was composed of about twelve homesteads. The dwelling-houses\r\nwere built of logs, those for beasts of turf or stones. By the church\r\nwas the schoolhouse, and there was a large store very much like our\r\ncountry stores at home.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants owned about sixty cows,--such small cows! they were\r\nabout three feet in height--one hundred and seventy sheep and a few oxen\r\nas small as the cows.\r\n\r\nKautokeino was full of nomadic Lapps, and we had a good time together,\r\nfor the Lapps are very friendly and I had learned to love them. "We come\r\nhere," they said, "to meet our friends, to see our children who are in\r\nschool, to get some of the provisions kept in our storehouses and other\r\nthings we want; and we bring with us skins of reindeer and the garments\r\nand shoes that have been made in our tents."\r\n\r\nIn this church hamlet were a number of very old Lapps, men and women who\r\ncould no longer follow their reindeer and endure a hard, wandering life.\r\nThither also the sick or the lame come, to stay until they get well or\r\ndie. Two Lapps were pointed out to me who were nearly one hundred years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of these Lapp hamlets are not nomadic; they live on the\r\nproduce of their farms, the increase of their reindeer, by catching\r\nsalmon, and in employing themselves as sailors on the fishing-boats of\r\nthe Arctic Sea, which they reach by descending the rivers.\r\n\r\nThe Lapp women wore queer-fitting little caps of bright colors, and when\r\nin holiday dress wore a number of large showy silk handkerchiefs.\r\nSometimes they had as many as four, on the top of one another, over\r\ntheir fur dresses; they wore necklaces of large glass beads, round their\r\nwaists were silver belts, and their fingers were ornamented with rings.\r\nThey wore trousers of reindeer skin, as the Lapp women do universally.\r\nThe men wore peaked caps.\r\n\r\nThese people were short of stature, compactly but slightly built, with\r\nstrong limbs, their light weight allowing them to climb, jump, and run\r\nquickly. There are no heavy men with big stomachs among them. Quite a\r\nnumber of Lapps have fair hair and blue eyes. They are unlike the\r\nEsquimaux, and in a crowd at home, dressed like ourselves, would pass\r\nunnoticed. There are a number of Lapps in the North-west of our own\r\ncounty. The tallest woman that I saw was 5 feet 1/2 inch, the tallest\r\nman 5 feet 4-1/2 inches; the smallest woman 4 feet 4-1/4 inches, the\r\nsmallest man 4 feet 7 inches. There were more women averaging 4 feet 10\r\ninches than men of that size, men averaging generally above five feet.\r\n\r\nI left Kautokeino, and that same day I came to Lake Givij\xc3\xa4rvi. I had to\r\nbe told that it was a lake, for it was a continuous snow-land. Here was\r\na farm, the owner of which kept a small store and sold sugar, coffee,\r\nsalt, flour, tobacco, matches, some woollen underwear, etc., to the\r\nLapps; and bought from them skins, shoes, and gloves, in summer smoked\r\ntongue and reindeer meat, reindeer cheese, etc., and every year went\r\nwith these to some of the Norwegian towns on the Arctic Sea to sell them\r\nand buy groceries and other goods.\r\n\r\nHere I had a clean room and bed. The place was a great rendezvous for\r\nnomadic Lapps, and I found many of them. The farmer extended to them\r\nunbounded hospitality, and spread as many reindeer skins on the floor at\r\nnight as the room could hold, for them to sleep on.\r\n\r\nThe Lapps liked the place very much, and came there to rest for a few\r\ndays, bringing their food with them. Their wives and children would also\r\ncome, and were sure to be welcome at the farm. I could not drink\r\nsufficient milk or coffee, or eat enough reindeer meat, cheese, or\r\nbutter that had been churned in summer, to please the good-hearted\r\nfarmer. He wanted no pay. He even insisted on accompanying me to\r\nKarasjok.\r\n\r\nThe sleighing was fine, and the snow was six and seven feet deep on a\r\nlevel. Our arrival at Karasjok, after a hundred miles\' journey from\r\nGivij\xc3\xa4rvi, was announced by the fierce barking of the dogs of the place,\r\nand twice I was almost overtaken by one more fierce than the others.\r\n"They only bark," shouted my guide. I was now in latitude 69\xc2\xb0 35\', and\r\nwithin a few miles of the longitude of Nordkyn. The hamlet was situated\r\non the shores of the Karasjoki river. Some of the fir trees of the\r\nforests near Karasjok measured twenty inches in diameter; but once cut\r\nthey do not grow again. I saw very few young trees.\r\n\r\nThe hamlet was composed of eighteen or twenty homesteads, with about one\r\nhundred and thirty inhabitants. There were over twenty horses, besides\r\ncows, sheep, and reindeer. The horses were so plentiful because they are\r\nused to haul timber. I reflected that the horse is a wonderful animal,\r\nand can live like man in many kinds of climate.\r\n\r\nAll the houses at Karasjok were built of logs. The finest residence was\r\nthat of the merchant of the place. The Karasjok Lapps, and others in the\r\nneighborhood, were very unlike those I had seen before. They were tall;\r\nsome of them six feet in height. The women were also tall, most of them\r\nhaving dark hair. The fair complexion and blue eyes were uncommon. Men\r\nand women wore strange-looking head-dresses. The men wore square caps of\r\nred or blue flannel, filled up with eider down. The women put on a\r\nwooden framework of very peculiar shape, appearing more or less like a\r\ncasque or the helmet of a dragoon.\r\n\r\nI only stopped the night in Karasjok, and after getting new reindeer at\r\nthe post station and a new guide, started north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n LEAVE KARASJOK STILL TRAVELLING NORTHWARD.--THE RIVER TANA.--RIVER\r\n     LAPPS.--FILTHY DWELLINGS.--ON THE WAY TO NORDKYN.--THE MOST\r\n     NORTHERN LAND IN EUROPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving Karasjok I travelled northward, over the frozen Karasjoki,\r\nuntil I came to a broad stream called the Tana. As we drove on the river\r\nI saw here and there solitary farms and strange little hamlets inhabited\r\nby river Lapps.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of the river Lapps is largely salmon catching in summer.\r\nThese fish are very abundant in the rivers. Many, during the codfish\r\nseason, engage themselves as sailors on the Arctic Sea. Almost every\r\nfamily has a small farm, stocked with diminutive cows; besides they have\r\nsheep and goats. During the summer their reindeer are taken care of by\r\nthe nomadic Lapps. These reindeer have to go to the mountains near the\r\nArctic Sea, on account of the mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nNow travelling was becoming very hard,--not on account of the snow, but\r\nbecause the inhabitants and their dwellings were so dirty.\r\n\r\nBut I had one comfort. All over that far northern land I felt so safe;\r\nit never came into my head that these people would rob me, though they\r\nknew I had plenty of money with me, according to their ways of\r\nthinking, to pay for reindeer and other travelling expenses; but the\r\nFinns and the Lapps are a God-fearing people.\r\n\r\nThe first day, I came to a place occupied by a single man. The house was\r\nso filthy, and vermin apparently so plentiful, that I whispered to my\r\nLapp guide, "Let us go on." The Lapp was so tired that he looked at me\r\nwith astonishment, and seemed to say: "Are not these comfortable\r\nquarters?"\r\n\r\nWe got into our sleighs, however, and further on we stopped and tied our\r\nreindeer together. The Lapp slept in his sleigh covered with a reindeer\r\nskin, and I in my bag.\r\n\r\nThe next day we halted before a farm. It was dark. There we intended to\r\nspend the night. The people do not lock their doors, neither do they\r\nknock to obtain admittance. So we entered. The family were all in bed. A\r\nman lighted a light. Such filth I thought I had never seen. The beds\r\nwere filled with dirty hay that had been there all winter. The sheepskin\r\nblankets with the wool on were almost as black as soot. The people who\r\nslept between them were without a particle of clothes. "What a place for\r\nvermin!" I whispered to myself.\r\n\r\nAt this sight, I again said in a low voice to my Lapp, "Let us go on."\r\nHe replied, "The reindeer are hungry, and we have had no food ourselves\r\nfor long hours. Let us remain overnight and breakfast here to-morrow."\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the owner of the place got up, put on a long dirty\r\nwoolen shirt, and went with us into the next room, which was clean. I\r\ngave a sigh of relief. The wooden bed had no hay, no sheepskin blankets.\r\nThe man got for me a clean reindeer skin which he said had just come out\r\nof the open air, where it had been for several days.\r\n\r\nTo my consternation my Lapp guide offered to sleep alongside of me, and\r\nadded, "We shall be warmer if we sleep together." I was in a dilemma. I\r\ndid not want to offend him, but I told him that I always slept by\r\nmyself. Then the owner of the place spread another reindeer skin on the\r\nfloor, and my guide slept upon it.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we breakfasted on dried reindeer meat, hard bread, and\r\nmilk. After bidding our host good-bye, and thanking him for his\r\nhospitality, we continued our journey, arriving towards noon at a farm\r\nowned by a river Lapp. The farm had three buildings; only the wife and\r\ndaughter were at home. The husband was cod fishing in the Arctic Sea.\r\nThe wife told me she had been a sailor before she was married, and\r\nengaged in cod fishing.\r\n\r\nThere were on this farm three diminutive cows, an ox of the size of the\r\ncows, nine sheep, and they owned besides quite a number of reindeer. The\r\ncows were getting smaller and smaller as I went north. In the little\r\ndwelling-house was a small room for a stranger; reindeer skins made the\r\nmattress. My guide and I ate together. We had excellent coffee, smoked\r\nreindeer meat, and milk.\r\n\r\nFurther on we stopped awhile at a little farm owned by a woman and her\r\ndaughter. The mother and daughter worked as if they were men; they\r\nfished for salmon in the river in summer, mowed hay, collected reindeer\r\nmoss to feed their cows, went after wood. A faithful dog was their\r\ncompanion. At some seasons the daughter descended the river, and engaged\r\nherself as one of the crew on board of a fishing boat on the Arctic\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nResuming our journey we passed the church hamlet of Utsjoki. Near\r\nUtsjoki I met some nomadic Lapps, who had a large herd of reindeer with\r\nthem, and were willing to take me to Nordkyn. That night I slept in\r\ntheir tent. Early the next morning they lassoed some very fine reindeer,\r\nwhich had superb horns and had not been used for quite a while. I did\r\nnot care now how fast the reindeer went, for I could keep inside of my\r\nsleigh. The men said: "We will meet on the promontory Lapps with their\r\nreindeer herds, and if it is very stormy we can go into their tent."\r\n\r\nSoon after we started.\r\n\r\nThey were not mistaken in regard to the speed of their beasts. They set\r\noff at a furious pace, and it was all I could do to keep inside of my\r\nsleigh. My pride was up, and I was bound to do my utmost not to upset.\r\n\r\nWe finally reached the high promontory which divides the Laxe from the\r\nTana fjord, at the extremity of which is Nordkyn. It was blowing a gale\r\nright from the north, and we had to protect our faces with our masks.\r\nFortunately we came to a Lapp encampment, and were received with great\r\nkindness and hospitality; enjoyed a good meal of reindeer meat, and a\r\ngood sleep afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the weather was fine, and I drove on to Kjorgosk\r\nNjarg--hard name to pronounce--the most northern land in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe land\'s end was nearing, and erelong I stood on the edge of Cape\r\nNordkyn, 71\xc2\xb0 6\' 50"--the most northern end of the continent of Europe,\r\nand rising majestically over seven hundred feet above the level of the\r\nsea. Before me was the Arctic Ocean, and beyond, a long way off and\r\nunseen by me, was the impenetrable wall of ice which the Long Night had\r\nbuilt to guard the Pole.\r\n\r\nFrom there I could see North Cape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n LEAVE NORDKYN.--FRANTIC EFFORTS OF THE REINDEER TO KEEP THEIR FOOTING\r\n     ON THE ICE.--THE BEAR\'S NIGHT.--FOXES AND ERMINES.--WEIRD CRIES OF\r\n     FOXES.--BUILDING SNOW HOUSES.--SHOOTING-BOXES.--KILLING FOXES.--TRAPS\r\n     FOR ERMINES.--A SNOW OWL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNordkyn being the land\'s end, I could not go further north, so I\r\nretraced my steps southward. That afternoon we saw on the other side of\r\na frozen lakelet the tent of some nomadic Lapps, and we made\r\npreparations to cross the lake to go and see them.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in the midst of the lake the wind rose, and before we knew\r\nit the ice was left bare around us, and our reindeer could not run or\r\nwalk over it, it was so slippery. They would fall at every step they\r\nmade, making all kinds of contortions to try to stand on their legs;\r\ntheir hoofs could not possibly hold on fast to the ice. We got out of\r\nour sleighs to help them. I said to myself that reindeer ought to be\r\nshod, especially to go over the ice.\r\n\r\nIt was awful--the poor beasts made frantic efforts to get on, but could\r\nnot. I thought we should never be able to cross the lake, and that we\r\nshould be obliged to abandon the reindeer, or try to put them into our\r\nsleighs, and drag these ourselves to the shore. But we watched our\r\nopportunity, and when a layer of snow was blown in our way, we succeeded\r\nin making some headway. At last we reached the shore, after three or\r\nfour hours of hard work.\r\n\r\nThe Lapps received us very kindly.\r\n\r\nThat night I heard the weird and dismal howls of foxes. They sounded so\r\nstrange in the stillness of darkness. In the morning I asked the Lapps\r\nhow many kinds of foxes were found in the country. "There are red, blue,\r\nand black foxes," they answered. "During the Bear\'s Night or winter\r\nmonths the blue foxes and the gray hares turn white; the fur of the\r\nblack fox is tipped with white, and he is known as the silver-gray fox,\r\nthe fur thus tipped being very valuable. The ptarmigan also, a species\r\nof grouse, turns white during the Bear\'s Night."\r\n\r\nI asked the Lapps, "Why do you call the winter months the \'Bear\'s\r\nNight\'?"\r\n\r\n"Because," one replied, "in this land the bears sleep all through the\r\nwinter months."\r\n\r\n"Goodness!" I exclaimed; "then the bear has a sleep that lasts five or\r\nsix months, and even more?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," the Lapp replied.\r\n\r\n"Are there any bears here," I asked, "that are sleeping in the\r\nneighborhood?--for I should like immensely to stir one up."\r\n\r\n"There are none this year," he replied.\r\n\r\nThen I said to him, "Let us go fox hunting, for I should like to get\r\nsome white and silver-gray fox-skins. We will build a snow house for\r\nour camp to shelter ourselves." One of the Lapps, called Jakob, agreed\r\nto go with me.\r\n\r\nBesides hunting foxes, we were to trap ermines and kill white hares, for\r\nI wanted to have a rug of their skins. I remembered that I had slept\r\nbetween two rugs of white hare skins, and how beautiful, soft, and warm\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\nAfter this talk Jakob went off after reindeer, and returned with three\r\nof them. In a short time our preparations for camping were made. We took\r\nwith us our sleeping-bags, some reindeer meat, a little salt, some hard\r\nbread, a coffee kettle, coffee, a small iron pot to cook our food in,\r\ntwo wooden shovels to help us in building a snow house and clearing the\r\nground of snow, our skees, guns, and ammunition. I did not forget a\r\ncouple of wax candles, for I always carried some with me, and plenty of\r\nmatches, besides a steel and flints in case some accident should happen\r\nto our matches. We took also a few slender poles, upon which we intended\r\nto hang our meat to keep it out of reach of prowling carnivorous\r\nanimals. These carefully packed and made secure in a special sleigh, we\r\nstarted. Our sleighs glided along as if they were going on smooth ice.\r\n\r\nAfter a journey of four hours, having travelled about sixty miles, we\r\ncame to the shores of a lake, and at one end were two conical dwellings\r\nbelonging to fishing or river Lapps. The smoke curling above their tops\r\nshowed us the people were at home.\r\n\r\n"Here," said Jakob, "we will build our snow houses. I think we shall\r\nfind plenty of foxes in the neighborhood, for the country is full of\r\nptarmigans, and the foxes prey upon them."\r\n\r\nWe tied our reindeer with long ropes, so that they should have plenty of\r\nroom to dig for moss. Then we began to build our snow house. It was so\r\ncold that the snow did not hold well together, so we concluded to make\r\ntwo instead of one, just big enough for each of us to sleep in and be\r\nprotected from the great cold. It was hard work. When finished they were\r\na little over five feet and a half long and some three feet wide inside.\r\n\r\n"I like this much better than going in and sleeping in the dwellings of\r\nthe river or fishing Lapps yonder," I said to Jakob.\r\n\r\nClearing a space for our fire in front, we put up three long poles we\r\nhad carried with us, and hung our meat high up upon them, so that wolves\r\nand foxes could not get at it. Then we put our sleighs containing our\r\noutfit on the top of each other and made them fast with cords. When this\r\nwas done Jakob said: "Foxes are often very bold, and they come and\r\nrummage around the tents; and when famished they bite everything they\r\nget hold of. We shall be able to hear them from our snow houses if they\r\ntry to get into our sleighs."\r\n\r\nWe had carried with us a few sticks of dry wood to be used as firewood,\r\nbut Jakob knew the country well and that near us were some junipers, the\r\nbranches of which appeared above the snow, and he went and gathered\r\nsome of them. The wood of the juniper, though green, burns well, for it\r\nis full of resinous matter.\r\n\r\nOur camp was now ready. The day\'s work being done we lighted a fire,\r\ncooked a piece of reindeer meat for our supper, and made coffee. Jakob,\r\nas usual, had some dried fish skin with him to clarify the coffee. After\r\nour meal we went into our snow houses, and taking off my Lapp grass and\r\nstockings, I laid them inside of my kapta on my chest to dry the\r\ndampness out of them during the night. Then I got into my bag. Jakob did\r\nlikewise, and after bidding each other good-night we fell asleep. Our\r\nhouses were warm and comfortable.\r\n\r\nDuring the night we were startled by the piercing howls of foxes, and\r\nthese kept us awake for a time. How dismal those howls sounded. We had\r\nevidently come to a good place to find foxes! Jakob evidently knew what\r\nhe was about, and had brought me to the right place.\r\n\r\nWhen we awoke the weather had become colder, the thermometer marking 45\r\ndegrees below zero. After a breakfast of reindeer meat and a cup of\r\ncoffee we went to reconnoitre on our skees and saw many tracks of foxes.\r\nI was delighted at the discovery, and said to myself, "Paul, do not\r\nleave this place till you have a few fox skins." I wished all the time\r\nthat these tracks might be those of the white and silver-gray foxes, for\r\nthey were the ones I particularly wanted.\r\n\r\nOn our return the fishing Lapps from the other side of the lake came on\r\ntheir skees to pay us a visit, and invited us to come and see them.\r\nLooking at their faces I thought they had not been washed for months,\r\nfor a coat of dirt covered their skins. I looked at their fur garments\r\nwith great suspicion, and kept away from them without appearing to do\r\nso. I found it necessary to use all the tact I possessed to avoid\r\nwounding their susceptibilities.\r\n\r\nAfter their departure Jakob said: "I am going to take the reindeer to\r\nsome friends of mine who have their camp within two hours from this\r\nplace, and they will take care of them until we go back." Then he bade\r\nme good-bye, saying, "I will not be long."\r\n\r\nI watched him until I lost sight of him and of the reindeer. Then I put\r\non my skees, took my gun, and went to look for foxes, and soon came upon\r\nfresh tracks of them. Once or twice I thought I saw white foxes, but\r\nthey are difficult to see at a long distance, being of the color of the\r\nsnow, and I could not be sure. Being satisfied of their presence in our\r\nneighborhood, I returned to the camp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I advanced cautiously."]\r\n\r\nAs I came within sight of our shelter I thought I saw on the snow, near\r\none of the poles where the reindeer meat was hung, something that was\r\nnot there when I had left. It was possible that it was only the snow\r\nthat had been piled up in heaps by us. "Strange," I said to myself,\r\n"that I did not notice that this morning." I advanced cautiously, when\r\nsuddenly I discovered that what I thought so strange was three foxes,\r\nwhite ones, seated and looking up intently at the reindeer meat,\r\nprobably thinking how they might reach it. I watched them while they\r\nstood still and kept their heads up, looking at the meat. I was glad the\r\nmeat was out of their reach, otherwise we should have had no supper. I\r\nstood perfectly still and kept watching them. The three foxes did not\r\nmove. Suddenly one turned round, and when he saw me he gave the alarm to\r\nhis companions and off they ran at a great rate, and soon were out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to the camp I saw that the foxes had gone round and round\r\nthe pole, in the hope of finding a way to reach the meat. It was lucky\r\nthat they had not intelligence enough to dig the snow with their paws at\r\nthe foot of the pole to make it come down.\r\n\r\nAfter this, looking over the snow, I saw in the distance a little black\r\nspot, which grew bigger and bigger as it came nearer. I recognized Jakob\r\non his skees.\r\n\r\nSoon after he arrived in our camp I told him about the foxes. "They will\r\ncome again," he replied, "for they are hungry. Other foxes will also\r\ncome, for they will surely scent our meat."\r\n\r\nAfter a while we began to work, and built two little round enclosures of\r\nsnow, the walls about three feet high, with openings here and there to\r\nfire from, and went inside and waited for the foxes, having previously\r\nput within a short shooting distance some reindeer meat. We waited for\r\nquite a while--no foxes--when suddenly I thought I saw something moving\r\nover the snow. Looking carefully I found that they were white foxes.\r\nThey had evidently scented the meat and were approaching in that\r\ndirection, and when within shooting distance we fired and two of them\r\nfell. They were fine creatures, with soft long hair almost as white as\r\nthe snow upon which they walked. We skinned them at once, and stretched\r\ntheir skins on frames we made from branches of juniper.\r\n\r\nThe next day we built two new snow entrenchments, in the opposite\r\ndirection to the others, and when it was dark we went into them, putting\r\nreindeer meat near.\r\n\r\nWe had not to wait long. I saw something black on the snow. Certainly\r\nthe animal was not a white fox. It could not be the cub of a bear, for\r\nit was the Bear\'s Night and they were all asleep. When the animal was\r\nnear enough I fired and it fell. I ran towards it, and saw that it was a\r\nsplendid silver-gray fox. How carefully we skinned the animal!\r\n\r\nThe next day Jakob made a lot of traps for ermines. These traps are made\r\nin the following manner: A string is attached to a loop long enough for\r\nthe head of the animal to pass through. The string is fastened to a\r\nbranch, which is bent down above the place where meat is deposited, some\r\ndistance back of the loop. The ermine approaches, and in trying to reach\r\nthe meat pushes his head through the loop and pulls the string up, and\r\nthe loop tightens round the neck and strangles the animal in the air.\r\n\r\nWe scattered these traps in every direction, and caught many ermines.\r\nHow pretty is the ermine, with its short legs, white fur, and tail\r\ntipped with black! The ermine feeds much on the ptarmigans.\r\n\r\nThat day I saw perched on the low branch of a tree a beautiful snowy\r\nowl, motionless, evidently watching for something. Jakob said to me,\r\n"The owl is watching for ermines. There are plenty of these, I am sure,\r\nround here, or the owl would not be on this tree. We will set some of\r\nour traps here." The owl was big and beautiful, and I said to myself,\r\n"The ermine feeds on the ptarmigans, and the owl on the ermine." I did\r\nnot like the idea of the harmless ptarmigans being eaten by ermines and\r\nowls, so I raised my gun and knocked him over.\r\n\r\nThe foxes, after being hunted for two or three days, became very shy and\r\nit was impossible to get near them. There were a great number of\r\nptarmigans, and they were so tame that we had no difficulty in getting\r\nmany for food.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, when we fired our guns they made hardly any noise, for\r\nthe air was so rarefied. We feasted well at our camp, for we also killed\r\na number of white hares.\r\n\r\nThe white fox had become so scarce that we concluded to leave our camp\r\nfor good, and Jakob went to get our reindeer. After packing we retraced\r\nour steps towards his home, his tent on the snow.\r\n\r\nIn one place where we stopped to rest I suddenly noticed that our\r\nreindeer had got loose. I shouted to Jakob, who was quietly taking a\r\nlittle snooze on the snow, "Our reindeer are loose!"\r\n\r\nWithout saying a word, he went to his sleigh and took a lasso. The Lapps\r\nnever travel without a lasso. This reassured me. "I must be very wary,\r\nfor our reindeer are somewhat wild," Jakob said; "Paulus, follow me." So\r\nI took to my skees. As we approached the animals moved off from us. Then\r\nhe came near enough to one of them, and threw his lasso and caught him.\r\nAfter making the animal fast, he went carefully after the others and\r\nsucceeded in lassoing them.\r\n\r\n"Well done," I said to him. Then we lay on the snow, with our masks to\r\nprotect our faces, and went to sleep. After a short nap we continued our\r\nway, and finally reached Jakob\'s tent just in time for supper, and were\r\nwarmly welcomed by the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n JAKOB TALKS TO ME ABOUT BEARS.--THE BEAR\'S NIGHT.--WATCHING A BEAR\r\n     SEEKING FOR WINTER QUARTERS.--THEY ARE VERY SUSPICIOUS.--I TELL A\r\n     BEAR STORY IN MY TURN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince I had heard of the Bear\'s Night, I wanted to know more about these\r\nanimals and their habits. After our supper, I said to Jakob, "Talk about\r\nbears to me--tell me about them." "All right," he replied. "I will tell\r\nyou all I know about them."\r\n\r\n"At the end of the summer and before the first fall of snow," he began,\r\n"the bears are very fat, for they have had plenty of berries and roots\r\nto eat. They are so fat that they can stand the long fast during the\r\nBear\'s Night; but when they go out in the spring from their snow cover,\r\nthey are very lean. We dread the bear more in the spring than during any\r\npart of the summer, for he is voraciously hungry all the time and goes\r\nafter cattle, horses, sheep, or reindeer."\r\n\r\n"I do not wonder at their being hungry, for the poor bear has to make up\r\nfor his long fast," I said.\r\n\r\nJakob continued: "The bear chooses a place in which he can lie\r\ncomfortably, such as under boulders or fallen trees, where he can be\r\nprotected from the snow. He becomes suspicious after he has chosen the\r\nplace for his Winter\'s Night, and for days he walks round and round to\r\nsee that there is no danger and to make sure that no enemy can see him.\r\nHe wants to feel perfectly safe before he goes into winter quarters. By\r\nwalking round wherever the wind blows, he is sure to scent danger, and\r\nif he does he moves away and goes to seek some other place. The bear is\r\nvery wary; it is almost impossible in summer to pursue him without dogs,\r\nfor he is so quick of foot and always on the alert, that when a hunter\r\nsees one he has to be more wary than the bear to approach within\r\nshooting distance of him. When badly wounded he attacks his enemy\r\nsuddenly."\r\n\r\nAfter Jakob had done speaking, I said to him, in my turn: "Let me tell\r\nyou a bear story. One autumn day when I had crossed the mountains by the\r\ngreat Sulitelma glacier and was descending the eastern slope on my way\r\nto the Gulf of Bothnia, my Lapp guide and I saw a big brown bear in the\r\ndistance, but as it was almost dark we decided not to go after him, for\r\nthe country was very stony. We camped that day in a forest of pines, in\r\norder to be sheltered from the wind, for we were to sleep without a fire\r\nso as not to make the bear suspicious. After taking our frugal meal of\r\nhard bread and butter, my Lapp said to me, \'To-morrow we shall see the\r\nbear; it is late in the season, and I am sure that he is looking for his\r\nwinter quarters in the neighborhood, and at the first indication of a\r\nbig snowstorm he will make ready for his long sleep, for the bears know\r\nwhen a snowstorm is coming.\'\r\n\r\n"\'How can they know?\' I inquired.\r\n\r\n"\'I cannot tell you, for I do not know,\' he replied, \'for I am not a\r\nbear; but they do know. Do not the swallows and other migrating birds\r\nknow the approach of winter and then fly southward?\'\r\n\r\n"\'They do,\' I replied.\r\n\r\n"That day we were very tired, for we had been tramping all day, down and\r\nup hills and leaping over boulders which covered the country in many\r\nplaces, and the wonder to me was that we did not break our necks.\r\n\r\n"The place we had chosen for the night was by a big boulder almost as\r\nlarge as a small house. There we could be sheltered against the cold\r\nwind of the night that came through the trees. I picked out a stone for\r\na pillow, then stretched myself by the side of the boulder on thick\r\nlichen that grew over the barren soil, and made a comfortable bed. My\r\nguide did likewise. Then we bade each other good-night and soon fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n"The next morning we wandered in the neighborhood where we had seen the\r\nbear, but that day we did not find him; then we moved in the direction\r\nwhither we thought he had gone. That evening we saw another boulder some\r\ntwelve or fifteen feet high. \'This will be a fine place of shelter for\r\nthe night,\' I said to the Lapp. He replied, \'It is just the place we\r\nwant. If the wind shifts we will shift also, so as to be protected.\'\r\n\r\n"I lay flat along the boulder on the thick reindeer moss, the Lapp did\r\nlikewise, and soon after we fell asleep with the pure bracing wind of\r\nthe mountains blowing over our faces.\r\n\r\n"The next morning we saw the bear; he was a long way from us. The Lapp\r\nsaid to me, \'I think the bear expects to winter round here; we must\r\nwatch him and follow him.\' Soon after the bear disappeared.\r\n\r\n"\'Do you think he has scented us?\' I asked. \'I do not see how he could,\'\r\nmy guide replied, \'the wind is in the wrong direction for that. He has\r\ngone for some reason of his own, you may be sure. There may have been\r\npeople on the other side of the hill and he has scented them.\'\r\n\r\n"We moved all round our boulder to scan the country, but there was no\r\nbear in sight as far as our eyes could reach. After a while I noticed a\r\nsmall black spot on the top of a hill. It was the bear; he was looking\r\nall round. He then walked away and disappeared. Soon he appeared again,\r\nand we saw him walk round and round a cluster of pines. The Lapp said:\r\n\'The bear is walking, making a ring in that manner. He tries to find out\r\nif there is any danger for him, and by walking round he is sure to get\r\nthe wind, no matter from what direction it comes. Sometimes the bear\r\nwill try a number of places for several days before he selects one.\'\r\n\r\n"\'How clever the bears are to walk around in that manner,\' I said.\r\n\r\n"Suddenly the bear disappeared. \'He has scented us,\' said the Lapp, \'and\r\nI think he will never come back here. We have eaten all the food we have\r\nwith us. We shall have to feed on berries the rest of our way. This bear\r\nwill probably remain in this region and take up his winter quarters\r\naround here somewhere. I will find out where he will lie. Come to me\r\nearly in the spring, before the snow melts, and we will kill him.\'\r\n\r\n"\'All right,\' I replied; but the following spring, I regret to say, I\r\nwas travelling in another part of the country, but I heard that Bruin\r\nmet his fate at the hands of my Lapp when he aroused himself from his\r\nlong sleep and came out from under the snow."\r\n\r\nThe bears in Sweden, Norway, and Finland are very fine animals and\r\nattain great size. They vary in the color of their fur, some being\r\nalmost black, but generally they are of different shades of brown. I\r\nthink they rank in size next to the grizzly bear of the Rocky Mountains.\r\nThey are sometimes dangerous, but not so much so as the grizzly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n PREPARATIONS FOR CROSSING THE MOUNTAINS TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN.--DECIDE TO\r\n     TAKE THE TRAIL TO THE ULF FJORD.--HOUSES OF REFUGE.--A SERIES OF\r\n     TERRIFIC WINDSTORMS IN THE MOUNTAINS.--LOST.--GLOOMY REFLECTIONS.--A\r\n     HAPPY REUNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day I said to Jakob and to the Lapps, "I wish some of you to go\r\nwith me across the mountains to the shore of the Arctic Ocean. I will\r\npay you well."\r\n\r\nWe were then between the 69th and 70th degrees, north latitude, and we\r\nhad to cross the mountains at an elevation of about 5,000 feet on our\r\nway to the sea. I wanted to find out the kind of weather they had in\r\nthese high altitudes in the Arctic regions.\r\n\r\n"Some of us will go with you," they replied; and added: "There are\r\nseveral trails leading to the Arctic Ocean. We can reach the sea by\r\ngoing to the Ofoden, the Ulf, the Lyngen, the Quananger, or the Alten\r\nfjords." I took my map out. After a conference it was agreed that we\r\nshould go to the Ulf fjord.\r\n\r\nNorway is the country of fjords. A fjord is an arm of the sea, winding\r\nits way far inland in the midst of mountains. The sea is very deep,\r\noften of greater depth than the towering heights which rise abruptly\r\nfrom the shore, though these are often several thousand feet in\r\naltitude. No road can be built along many of these fjords, and boats are\r\nthe conveyances that are used to go from one place to another.\r\n\r\n"There are houses of refuge in the mountains, where we shall find\r\nshelter in case of heavy storms," said the Lapps. "If it were not for\r\nthose places of refuge people would often perish when overtaken by these\r\nstorms. Paulus, you have met great windstorms on your way here, but they\r\nare nothing to compare with the terrific winds to be met in the high\r\nmountains. Remember that we are in the month of March--the month of\r\nstorms."\r\n\r\nAs I was listening to what the Lapps said, I thought I heard, from\r\nacross the Atlantic, my young folks and friends encouraging me, crying:\r\n"Be not afraid, Paul. Go on! Go on! No harm will befall you!" I shouted\r\nback, "I am not afraid!"\r\n\r\nSo we started. First we came to a Finn hamlet, where we met a good many\r\nFinlanders and Laplanders who had arrived with their goods and a great\r\nmany sleighs and reindeer on their way to the Ulf fjord. All the animals\r\nhad been trained to eat reindeer moss gathered and stored for that\r\npurpose. We had come just in time.\r\n\r\nHere it was agreed that Jakob and the Lapps who had taken me to this\r\nplace should not go further, but that I should be taken care of by\r\nFinlanders, whose destination was the same as mine and who were on their\r\nway to the Arctic Sea. I was to go with John Puranen. John was a\r\npowerfully built man, with a very kind expression.\r\n\r\nWe were soon good friends. John and a party of friends were going with a\r\nlarge number of sleighs loaded with reindeer meat, butter, reindeer\r\ncheese, smoked tongues, skins, garments, shoes, and thousands of frozen\r\nptarmigans, to sell to the people living on the coast.\r\n\r\nThe day after our coming parties of Finlanders and Laplanders began to\r\nleave, with forty or fifty sleighs and a number of spare reindeer in\r\ncase any gave out.\r\n\r\nAs I looked over the snow, I could see the caravans following each\r\nother, in single file, and a number of dogs following their masters.\r\n\r\nThe next day we started with a large party. We all hoped for good\r\nweather. We took a good supply of reindeer moss with us.\r\n\r\nLate at night we came to the first farm of refuge found in our track.\r\nHundreds of sleighs and reindeer were outside, and when I entered the\r\nhouse more than a hundred men were sleeping on the floor. The snoring\r\nwas something terrific, and the heat and the closeness of the room were\r\nunbearable. A lighted lamp shone dimly on the slumberers.\r\n\r\nSo I thought that I would be far more comfortable sleeping outside in my\r\ntwo bags. John said that he would sleep in his bags by me--and in fact\r\nwe slept very comfortably.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "The mist was so thick that I could not see ahead."]\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke in the morning it was 42 degrees below zero. Then we\r\nwent into the house and had some coffee and reindeer meat for breakfast.\r\nAs at all the post stations, there is a tariff for everything printed on\r\nthe walls, so no overcharge is practised.\r\n\r\nMany of the people had already left; we hurried on to overtake them, and\r\nas usual went in single file.\r\n\r\nThe weather had become windy, and the wind blew stronger and stronger as\r\nwe went on, until there was hardly any snow left on the ground. It flew\r\nto a great height, and the mist was so thick that I could not see ahead.\r\nMy reindeer was going of its own accord. I trusted him to scent and\r\nfollow the other reindeer ahead of me. I hurried him on by striking\r\nslightly his right flank with my rein, hoping to overtake the people of\r\nour party.\r\n\r\nThe wind kept increasing, and seeing no one ahead or behind I became\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\nWhere were John and the other fellows? I had no provisions with me.\r\nWhere was I? Once in a while, when there was a lull that lasted about a\r\nminute, I saw nothing but huge mountains ahead of me. At sight of them I\r\nbecame more anxious than ever. I could only hear the shrieking of the\r\nwind, which at times threatened to upset me. Occasionally it blew so\r\nhard that my reindeer had to stop.\r\n\r\nMy head was entirely hidden by my mask and my hood, which had been made\r\nso secure that I felt it would stay with my head till both were blown\r\naway. Only my eyes could be seen; but the snow which kept flying in the\r\nair became as fine as flour and penetrated everywhere. It got through\r\nthe open space for my eyes, then gathered on my hair, eyelashes,\r\neyebrows, and mustache, and on my cheeks and nose; in fact, everywhere\r\non my face, and made a mask of ice.\r\n\r\nI wished I had no mustache, no eyebrows, no eyelashes, no hair--for it\r\nwas very painful every time I broke this mask of ice. It was hardly\r\nbroken when it would form again from the particles of new snow adhering\r\nto each other. When I broke it, I thought every hair would be torn from\r\nmy face. If I had not cleared it away the mask of ice would have become\r\nso thick that I would have been unable to see. I began to think that\r\nthere was no fun crossing the mountains after all, if this was the\r\nweather we were going to get all the way.\r\n\r\nAs I could not overtake the people ahead, and John was not in sight,\r\ngloomy thoughts came over me. Suppose I can find nobody, nor even a\r\nhouse of refuge, I repeated: what then? What will become of me in this\r\nterrific windstorm, in the midst of these great towering mountains that\r\nsurround me on every side? An answer to my question, as dark as my\r\nthought, said: "Starvation! Starvation! Death! Death!"\r\n\r\nSuddenly I thought I heard, through the storm, the same voice from the\r\nfriends at home shouting to me, "Be of good cheer, Paul; go on; go on!\r\nNo harm will befall you!"\r\n\r\nThese imaginary words had hardly been uttered when I said to myself,\r\n"If the worst comes to the worst, and when I am on the point of\r\nstarving, I will kill my reindeer, drink its warm blood to sustain my\r\nlife, abandon my sleigh, and depend on my skees. By that time the storm\r\nmay be over, and I may meet some of the people who were with me, or\r\nother parties who are going to the Arctic Sea."\r\n\r\nSoon after I had reached this decision, however, I saw through the mist\r\nsomething black. Was it a pack of hungry wolves? It was moving towards\r\nme. I seized my gun; but how could I shoot in such weather and be sure\r\nto kill? I did not fancy the idea of being attacked by a pack of hungry\r\nand starving wolves. At any rate, I would make a desperate effort to\r\nkill some; these would be eaten by the pack, and after they were\r\nsatisfied they would perhaps not follow me but let me alone. Perhaps I\r\nmight kill a wolf and suck his warm blood; this would avoid the need of\r\nkilling my reindeer.\r\n\r\nNo, they were not wolves, but people! I was in the midst of my friends;\r\nthey had stopped and were waiting for me.\r\n\r\nNow I felt happy. John\'s dog also felt happy for he wagged his tail and\r\nlooked at me, and John said, "Paulus, if you had been lost, my dog would\r\nhave found you."\r\n\r\nThen they exclaimed: "We would never have gone to the sea without you.\r\nWe would have wandered all over the mountains with our reindeer or on\r\nour skees to find you. But we thought your reindeer would follow our\r\ntrack, for he could scent ours, as the wind was in the right direction;\r\nand here we were waiting for you." I could hardly hear their voices,\r\nthough they surrounded me, for they were drowned in the hissing of the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nWe continued our way and came to another house of refuge, where we took\r\nshelter. There we could wait until the storm was over.\r\n\r\nIt was so nice to stretch one\'s legs and to stand up and pace the floor\r\nand bring the blood into circulation.\r\n\r\nWhat would the people do while travelling in such a climate without\r\nhouses of refuge? The place of refuge was a mountain farm; they had\r\ncows, goats, and sheep, for there were pastures near by in summer.\r\n\r\nWhen the time to sleep came I stretched myself at full length upon a\r\nreindeer skin on the floor, and fell asleep hearing the wind howling\r\nfiercely round the house.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke in the morning the storm had ceased. I washed my face and\r\nhands in water and dried them with a clean towel which the wife handed\r\nme. What a luxury!\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we bade the kind people of the house of refuge good-bye,\r\nand once more we were on our way to the Arctic Sea. We had not been two\r\nhours on the way, however, when the sky began to grow gray and\r\napparently a storm was coming; the wind increased, and flakes of snow\r\nbegan to fall; the squalls increased in force and frequency. Little did\r\nI know that these were the forerunners of a series of great windstorms\r\nthat were to take place nearly five thousand feet above the sea. In a\r\nword, I was to encounter the greatest windstorms I have ever met in my\r\nlife. The dark clouds kept flying very fast high over our heads, then at\r\ntimes seemed to be hardly above the top of the mountains. The sky became\r\nwild and peculiar. John was hurrying his reindeer as fast as he could by\r\nstriking his flanks. He evidently knew what was coming, for he was a\r\nchild of the stormy regions of the North, and knew what such a\r\nthreatening sky meant in March. The wind was increasing in force every\r\nminute, the snow flew thicker in the air. At last, when we reached the\r\nstation of refuge, John gave a great shout of satisfaction. We had come\r\njust in time. The snow was driven in thick clouds, the hills and\r\nmountains were hidden from view, and all around was nothing but a thick\r\nhaze. The fur of our garments was entirely filled with particles of\r\nsnow; we looked as if we had been rolled in a barrel of flour.\r\n\r\nI gave a great sigh of relief when we came in front of the house of\r\nrefuge. It was well that we hurried with all our might, for we would\r\nnever have reached the place at a slower speed. Then what would have\r\nbecome of John and me, and of the others!\r\n\r\nAt bedtime reindeer skins were strewn on the floor, for many had come to\r\nget shelter against the furious windstorm. Before going to sleep, we\r\ntook off our shoes, and carefully hung them with our stockings and Lapp\r\ngrass on the poles that were suspended near the ceiling. Then we bade\r\neach other good-night and thanked the farmer and his wife for their\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nThat night I dreamed that the same voices that I had heard before were\r\nsaying to me, "Go on! Go on! Friend Paul, no harm will befall you. Do\r\nnot be afraid, be valiant, as you were in Africa. Then come back and\r\ntell us what you have seen in \'The Land of the Long Night.\'" Thereupon I\r\nsaw all their faces smiling at me. I felt so happy during that sleep.\r\nBut it was nothing but a sweet dream. When I awoke there was nothing\r\nround me to remind me of my far-away friends, of the girls and boys I\r\nloved so dearly. "What makes you, Paul, so fond of a wandering life," I\r\nsaid to myself, "and of encountering such perils and hardships as you\r\nhave done all through your life, when you have so many warm friends at\r\nhome?"\r\n\r\nIn the morning, one by one, the people awoke and got up. The weather was\r\ncalm, but John said: "The weather is not to be trusted at this time of\r\nthe year on these high mountains." I had great faith in John, as a\r\nweather prophet.\r\n\r\nMost people had their provisions with them. I was to drink my coffee in\r\nthe finest cup owned by the owners of the house of refuge. "Taste some\r\nof my butter," a Finlander would say. "Taste my smoked reindeer meat,"\r\nurged a Laplander. "Help yourself to some of my cheese," said a third.\r\nIf I had eaten a little of all that was offered, I should not have been\r\nable to travel. People must not eat too much when they have plenty of\r\nexercise to perform, or hard work to do.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast John said to me: "It is wise in these mountains to\r\nprepare for all kinds of weather. It has been bad enough already, but it\r\nmay be a great deal worse, for to-day the mountains we are to cross are\r\nvery high."\r\n\r\n"Goodness gracious!" I exclaimed. "Is it possible that we can have worse\r\nweather than we have seen, John?" "Certainly," he replied. I wondered\r\nwhat sort of weather it could be!\r\n\r\nJohn attended himself to my toilet; he would not trust me. He put my\r\nstockings on, put an extra quantity of Lapp grass round them, and saw\r\nthat every part of my foot to my ankle was well protected, tied the\r\nshoes over my ankles and my reindeer-skin trousers most carefully, saw\r\nthat my belt was well fastened, that my "pesh" or fur blouse was\r\ncarefully made fast round my neck, and that my gloves were well secured\r\nto my wrists with bands used for that purpose and my hood tied tightly.\r\nWhen he had finished, he said, with a smile:\r\n\r\n"Paulus, you are ready to stand the strongest windstorm that can blow;\r\neverything on your body is made as secure as it can be!"\r\n\r\nOur reindeer being harnessed we bade good-bye to the people of the house\r\nof refuge, and a number of parties left together for self-protection.\r\n\r\nJohn was not mistaken about the weather. Three or four hours after our\r\ndeparture the wind increased, and terrific squalls followed each other\r\nand threatened to upset our sleighs. The blinding snow dust prevented my\r\nseeing my reindeer, and at times I could not even see the head of my\r\nsleigh. Night seemed to have taken the place of daylight,--a thick fog\r\ncould not have been worse. Then, to add to my discomfort, I had\r\ncontinually to break through the mask of ice, which formed again quickly\r\nafter being broken. It was of no use to look for the furrows of the\r\nsleighs that had preceded us, for their tracks were filled at once with\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nOnce more I thought I was lost, when I saw John standing still; he was\r\nwaiting for me, and attached my sleigh to his, so that the mishap of\r\nbeing parted again could not occur. When he had tied the two sleighs, he\r\nsaid: "If we are lost we will be together." Dear John, what a glorious\r\nfellow he was!\r\n\r\nI thought of what I imagined the "Long Night" had said to me after the\r\ndisappearance of the sun: "I send terrific gales and mighty snowstorms\r\nupon ocean and lands." It seemed to me that I could hear her sardonic\r\nlaugh after telling me of her power. The storm continued to increase,\r\nand swept down upon us from the higher mountain sides with a force which\r\nI had never witnessed before, though I have crossed the Atlantic more\r\nthan twenty times in winter and met with furious gales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "We remained seated on the ground, back to back."]\r\n\r\nWhen I thought that it was impossible for the wind to blow stronger, the\r\nnext squall proved that it could. Then we fell in with a number of men\r\nof the party. They had stopped; they did not dare to go further,\r\ntravelling had become impossible; before we knew it we might fall over a\r\nprecipice, or go in the wrong direction. I managed to look at my\r\nthermometer. It was 17 degrees below zero. I wished it had been forty or\r\nforty-five, for instead of a windstorm we should then have had glorious\r\nstill weather.\r\n\r\nThe wind had risen to such a pitch that no snow was left on the ground,\r\nthough in many places it must have been twenty or thirty feet deep or\r\nmore. It was all flying in the air, and though it was noon it was quite\r\ndark. We remained seated on the ground, back to back, in order to\r\nsupport each other, with our heads bent, to prevent as far as possible\r\nthe snow getting under our masks. It was a weird sight, as once in a\r\nwhile I could see dimly through the flying snow our bent, immovable\r\nbodies, with heads down. Not a man said a word; it seemed as if we were\r\nfrozen to death.\r\n\r\nThe snow was carried hither and thither, and all at once in a lull of a\r\nfew seconds fell, forming hillocks, which were in an instant destroyed\r\nand sent flying in the air. One of these hillocks settled dangerously\r\nnear us and scared us.\r\n\r\nThen one of the men suggested that we had better divide into two\r\nparties, so that in case one should be buried in the snow, the other\r\nparty could help to extricate those who were buried. This suggestion was\r\naccepted at once. As we got up several of the men were taken off their\r\nfeet, and rolled over against some sleighs, which stopped them. I was\r\nraised bodily and thrown on the ground, and carried away; but some of\r\nthe men came to my rescue and caught me. Finally we succeeded in making\r\ntwo parties; we were about fifty yards from each other and ready to help\r\none another in case of emergency.\r\n\r\nThe wind became so terrific that we had to crouch against the rocks. I\r\nthought we must be in the heart of "The Land of the Wind," and that this\r\nwas the worst country I had ever come to. I almost believed that the\r\nwind had obtained the mastery over the world, and chaos was coming\r\nagain. But after a few hours these north-west squalls gradually\r\ndiminished in intensity, and for a time the windstorm seemed to be over.\r\nThen we made preparations to continue our journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n A DANGEROUS DESCENT.--HOW TO DESCEND THE MOUNTAINS.--THE MOST PERILOUS\r\n     PORTION OF THE JOURNEY.--EXHAUSTION OF THE REINDEER.--ALL SAFE AT\r\n     THE BOTTOM.--ARRIVAL AT THE SHORE OF THE ARCTIC SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we were ready to start, John said to me: "Paulus, we are soon to come\r\nto the most dangerous part of the journey; we are to descend the western\r\nslopes of the mountains, which at times are very abrupt, to the sea. We\r\nwill go over mountain tops and descend their steep declivities. We shall\r\nhave to drive twice along the sides of deep ravines; all that are here\r\nare going together, so that we may help each other. Get into your sleigh\r\nand follow us closely. I will lead, and my brother will be behind you."\r\n\r\nWe set forth, and soon afterwards I noticed that our reindeer went much\r\nfaster than at the start. I knew by this that we were approaching the\r\nslope of a mountain. I was right. Next we came to the brink of a hill,\r\nand descended with a rapidity of at least twenty-five miles an hour. The\r\nanimals simply flew.\r\n\r\nWhen my reindeer reached the bottom of the hill he made the usual sudden\r\ncurve to the left to keep the sleigh, which had a tremendous momentum,\r\nfrom striking against his legs. I had prepared myself for the sudden\r\nmotion; I had been there before! I bent my body almost out of the sleigh\r\nin the opposite direction, and succeeded in keeping in. It was a fine\r\nsight to see sleigh after sleigh coming down the hill, but no man\r\nfollowed exactly in the track of the others, so that in case of accident\r\nthe one behind would not pitch headlong into the sleigh ahead.\r\n\r\nI thought this was lots of fun. But ascending the hill on the opposite\r\nside was no fun at all. It was indeed hard work for the reindeer and for\r\nthe men. The snow had drifted on one side of the hill and was very deep,\r\nand in many places very soft. The poor reindeer spread their hoofs as\r\nwide as they could, so as not to sink too deeply. But in many places it\r\nwas of no avail; they would sink to their flanks and even deeper; but it\r\nwas wonderful to see how quickly they sprang out.\r\n\r\nWe should never have been able to ascend the hill without going in\r\nzigzag. We had often to get out of our sleighs and take to our skees.\r\nOne Finn lent me a pair of them that were much shorter than mine, to\r\nascend the hills. I should never have been able to do it had I not\r\nfollowed the track of those ahead. Though it was 43 degrees below zero,\r\nI was in a profuse perspiration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Once in a while I gave a look towards the ugly\r\nprecipice."]\r\n\r\nAt times the poor reindeer panted; their tongues protruded. They would\r\nfall down on their backs, breathing heavily. My reindeer was so\r\nexhausted and breathed so hard, with protruding tongue and mouth wide\r\nopen, that I thought he was going to die. "Don\'t be afraid," said\r\nJohn to me with a smile, as he saw my anxious face, "reindeer often act\r\nlike this when they are exhausted; yours will soon be all right."\r\n\r\nJohn was not mistaken.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful how quickly they all recovered, and after eating plenty\r\nof snow they went on as if nothing had happened to them, until they\r\nagain became exhausted and powerless. When we reached the top of a\r\nmountain, we waited for those of our party that lagged behind. I said to\r\nJohn, "I hope we have not many more of these hills to ascend." "We have\r\nnone so steep; but, Paulus, now we have come to the most dangerous part\r\nof our whole journey; we are going to run along the brink of one of the\r\nravines of which I spoke to you. Look ahead," said he, pointing to the\r\ndeep ravine.\r\n\r\nWhen all the men of our party had arrived at the top of the hill, every\r\none began to make careful preparations for the descent, and I watched\r\nwith great earnestness what was done. Once in a while I gave a look\r\ntowards the ugly precipice. I did not like the sight a bit. The men were\r\nanxious, and showed this in the care and pains they took in testing\r\nevery plaited leather cord, and those were especially strong that were\r\nto be used for such an emergency. They knew how dangerous was the ride\r\nand that no cord must snap.\r\n\r\nA number of sleighs were lashed with mine by a very strong plaited\r\nleather cord. When John was through he said to me: "This cord cannot\r\nbreak."\r\n\r\nBehind each sleigh a reindeer was fastened, the cord being attached at\r\nthe base of his horns. John said to me: "Reindeer cannot bear to be\r\npulled quickly, and make every effort to disengage themselves, and by\r\ndoing so act as a drag." All the sleighs had been lashed together by\r\nfours, sixes, eights, or tens. We had plenty of spare reindeer with us,\r\nand at the end of each set of sleighs two or three reindeer were made\r\nfast to the last one. A man was in the front sleigh of the set to lead,\r\nand another man in the last one. John was to lead the set in which I\r\nwas, and his brother was to be in the last. As usual each man rode his\r\nsleigh with his legs outside, turned back somewhat, or reversed, with\r\nthe top of his shoes touching the snow, the feet to act as rudder.\r\n\r\nWhen I did the same a great cry went up. I heard, "No! No! Paulus, your\r\nlegs will surely be broken; put them inside your sleigh, as you have\r\nalways done!" and before I could say a word in reply John and a Finn\r\nwere by me, each taking one of my legs and putting it inside.\r\n\r\nA short time was to elapse between the start of each set of sleighs, so\r\nthat there would be no chance of their coming in contact. The signal was\r\ngiven, and one set after another started with great speed. It was one of\r\nthe grandest and most dangerous sights I had ever seen, but the Lapps\r\nand Finns were accustomed to this, for they generally went twice every\r\nwinter to the Arctic Sea with their produce for sale.\r\n\r\nThen my turn came. John started and off we went.\r\n\r\nAs the sleighs swerved in the descent the tension was very great. I said\r\nto myself, "If the cord that keeps our sleighs together breaks we shall\r\nbe pitched far below and be dashed against the rocks with incredible\r\nforce."\r\n\r\nIn the mean time every reindeer was holding back with all his power,\r\nmaking efforts to disengage himself, and by doing this acted as a brake\r\non the sleighs in front. If they had not done so the descent would have\r\nbeen impossible.\r\n\r\nWhat speed! I had never seen anything like this descent before. Here was\r\na terrifying precipice, the sloping rocks leading towards the chasm. I\r\nwas afraid the reindeer would miss their footing. I hoped that no bare\r\nice would be met. At any moment we might have been thrown out headlong.\r\nAfter we reached the dale, which closed abruptly at the head of the\r\nravine, I was breathless from excitement. I had just ended one of two of\r\nthe most exciting rides I had ever taken. We waited for those that were\r\nbehind, and when they had arrived we rested for a while.\r\n\r\nI asked John what would have happened if one of the cords had snapped.\r\nHe did not answer my question, but simply looked at me with a serious\r\nexpression. I knew what it would have meant. Death!\r\n\r\nFurther on we had another descent of the same character, but not so\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nWe were all glad when we reached the station of refuge; we were so tired\r\nfrom the excitement of the day.\r\n\r\nWe had crossed the backbone of the mountain, and had come down the\r\nwestern slope. Each stream now flowed to the Arctic Sea.\r\n\r\nThe next day we continued the descent. The day before we had come to the\r\nzone where the juniper grew; to-day we passed the birch. Then came the\r\nfir trees. Darkness overtook us, and I could not make out what sort of\r\nland it was, but soon we came to the house of a fisherman, where we all\r\nspent the night.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke in the morning and looked out I found that I was at the\r\nbottom of a great chasm with towering mountains on each side. I had\r\nnever seen the like. It seemed to me that I had come to a world unknown\r\nbefore. Looking towards the west I saw a long dark green line of water,\r\nsunk deeply into the ragged and precipitous mountains. I had come to the\r\nUlf Fjord. The water was the Arctic Sea. I was on the shores of grand\r\nold Norway.\r\n\r\nThe fjord was frozen at its inner extremity for about one mile with\r\nthick solid ice. At the inner end of every fjord there is a river,\r\nflowing through a valley, which is the continuation of the fjord;\r\nconsequently the water is only brackish and freezes more easily than\r\nsalt water. Further on the fjord is free of ice, for in this part of the\r\nworld, though so far north, the sea is made warm by the Gulf Stream, the\r\nvery same Gulf Stream that starts from West Africa and flows westward to\r\nthe coast of Brazil, then branches off northward and runs close to our\r\nAmerican shores. Without the Gulf Stream this part of Norway would be a\r\nland of ice, just as the land of North-west America is, in the same\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\nI remembered that I had sailed over the Gulf Stream waters near the\r\nAfrican coast, and it had come to meet the same stream again on that\r\nfar-away northern shore--beyond the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\nMy journey over mountains 5,000 feet high, between the 69th and 70th\r\ndegrees of north latitude, was over.\r\n\r\nI saw a vessel in the distance, and with one of the fishermen living on\r\nthis inhospitable shore we went on board. It was good luck the vessel\r\nwas going to sail north. The captain was willing to take me with him on\r\nhis voyage.\r\n\r\nI thanked John and my other travelling companions for the kindness they\r\nhad shown me. We parted with great tokens of friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n SAIL ON THE ARCTIC OCEAN.--THE BRIG _RAGNILD_.--\xc3\x86GIR AND RAN, THE GOD\r\n     AND GODDESS OF THE SEA.--THE NINE DAUGHTERS OF \xc3\x86GIR AND RAN.--GREAT\r\n     STORMS.--COMPELLED TO HEAVE TO.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I stepped on board I said farewell to my dear skees and sleigh, as\r\nthey were put into the hold. "I shall miss you very much," I said, "for\r\nwe have had happy times together." Then we sailed away. Now I have laid\r\naside my Lapp costume, and I am clad in the garb of a fisherman. I am\r\nclothed in a suit of oilskin garments, over my woollens, to protect me\r\nfrom the wet. I wear a big sou\'wester, instead of a cap, to keep the\r\nrain and the spray from running down my neck, and huge sea-boots to keep\r\nmy legs and feet dry. In these I am ready to brave the storms of the\r\nArctic Ocean. Now a boat will be my sleigh, its sail my reindeer: these\r\nwill carry me onward on the sea, as the others have done on the snow.\r\n\r\nAs I stood quietly on deck looking at the sea, the captain said to me,\r\n"For a wonder we have pleasant weather. This winter we have had nothing\r\nbut a succession of gales or terrific squalls, and what is worse,\r\nblinding snowstorms, when we could not even see each other on deck."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I am clad in the garb of a fisherman."]\r\n\r\nThe _Ragnild_--such was the name of our vessel--was a staunch Norwegian\r\nbrig that had weathered many a gale on the stormy coast of Norway and\r\nthe Arctic Sea. She was bound for the coast of Finmarken, on the east\r\nside of North Cape, to buy codfish. On board were provisions and\r\nclothing, boots, etc., for sale to the fishermen we were to meet in the\r\ncoast settlements.\r\n\r\nOur crew was composed of most sturdy seafaring men. The name of the\r\ncaptain was Ole Petersen, a real old salt who had been at sea for nearly\r\nfifty years and was part owner of the craft.\r\n\r\nJohn Andersen was the first mate; the sailors were Lars, Evert, Ivor,\r\nHakon, Pehr, and Harald. All of these men had encountered many a gale,\r\nand two had been wrecked.\r\n\r\nTowards nine o\'clock that evening, the captain and I went to our bunks,\r\nthe captain leaving the first mate and three men on the watch.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke in the morning the _Ragnild_ was rolling heavily; we were\r\nin the midst of an angry sea and of a great gale, and while I was\r\ndressing I was thrown from one side of my little stateroom to the other,\r\nand it was no fun. I came on deck, and as I looked at the big waves I\r\nsaid, "The wind and the waves are in their ugly mood." The wind howled\r\nand shrieked through the rigging, and waves were like big hills. I\r\nthought of the many wrecks of ships and boats, and of the multitude of\r\npassengers and seafaring men that have been drowned since people have\r\nsailed on the seas.\r\n\r\nThe captain murmured to me, "This is ugly weather indeed. We must employ\r\nall the skill we have to fight against the storm. Our sails are new, our\r\nrigging is strong, and our vessel is staunch, and we are all valiant men\r\non board who have gone through many such a storm before."\r\n\r\nThat morning as I watched the coast, I remembered that the Vikings\r\nbelieved and worshipped \xc3\x86gir as the god of the sea. \xc3\x86gir ruled over the\r\nsea and the wind. Ran was his wife, and she had a net in which she\r\ncaught all those who were lost at sea; her Hall was at the bottom of the\r\nocean, and there she welcomed all the shipwrecked people.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x86gir and Ran had nine daughters, and their names were emblematic of the\r\nwaves. They were called _Hefring_ the Hurling, _Hr\xc3\xb6nn_ the Towering,\r\n_Bylgja_ the Upheaving, _Bara_ the Lashing.\r\n\r\nThe five other daughters were called _Himingl\xc3\xa6fa_ the Heaven Glittering,\r\n_Bl\xc3\xb6dughadda_ the Bloody Haired, _Kolga_ the Cooling, _Unn_ the Loving,\r\n_Dufa_ the Dove.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings dreaded Hefring, Hr\xc3\xb6nn, and Bylgja when far out at sea, and\r\nBara when they were approaching the shore. These four waves are those\r\nthe mariners dread to-day.\r\n\r\nThey believed that these daughters of \xc3\x86gir and Ran were seldom partial\r\nto men, that the wind awakened them and made them angry and fierce. They\r\ncalled them "The white-hooded daughters of \xc3\x86gir and Ran." They called\r\nthe spray their hair. They believed that in calm weather they walked on\r\nthe reefs and wandered gently along the shores, and that their beds\r\nwere rocks, stone-heaps, pebbles, and sands.\r\n\r\nI had not been long on the sea before I found that I had exchanged the\r\nterrific winds of Arctic "Snow Land" for the gales of the Arctic Ocean.\r\nThe weather was fearful! Snow, sleet, hurricanes, treacherous heavy\r\nsqualls, followed each other in succession.\r\n\r\n"This is the winter weather we have here," said the captain; "we do not\r\nexpect any better at this time of the year. When there is a lull, it is\r\nonly to deceive us; then it blows harder than ever, and the snow or the\r\nsleet falls thicker than before."\r\n\r\nMy fancy recalled again to me the words of the "Long Night": "I send\r\nterrific gales and mighty snowstorms over oceans and lands."\r\n\r\nAs I looked at the ocean I saw a big towering wave rolling up towards\r\nthe stern of the ship and apparently gaining upon us. It was transparent\r\nand of a deep green color. I imagined I could see Hefring with\r\nglittering eyes, one of her arms directing the wave against us.\r\n\r\nThe men looked anxiously towards the wave, which was steadily advancing,\r\nbut our ship rode over it as if she were a gull resting on the ocean.\r\nThen the ugly wave formed a crest, curled upon itself, and with a heavy\r\nboom broke into fragments of snowy foam.\r\n\r\nI said to the men: "This wave has missed us." They answered in serious\r\nvoices, "And we must watch, for a more towering one will follow, as\r\nthere are always three of them going together, and this second one may\r\ncome and break over us."\r\n\r\nThese words were hardly uttered when I saw far off another mountainous\r\nwave rolling up. I imagined it was Hr\xc3\xb6nn. It was so high as it neared us\r\nthat we could not see the horizon beyond; it looked fierce and\r\ndangerous. Its crest gradually rose higher and higher, as if getting\r\nready to strike. Steadily Hr\xc3\xb6nn advanced. We are lost, and our ship is\r\nsure to founder if her wave breaks over our stern. The faces of the\r\ncaptain and men were serious. I said to myself: "If we get into the\r\nwhirlpool of its crest there will be no escape; we are sure to founder."\r\n\r\nThe wave broke about fifty yards before reaching us. It had become\r\nharmless, but the foaming, scattered billows enveloped the ship in their\r\nthick spray. It was a narrow escape; but we were saved thus far! Then in\r\nthe wake of the imaginary Hr\xc3\xb6nn rose another wave. I imagined Bylgja was\r\ncoming. It advanced slowly and angrily towards us, ready to sweep our\r\ndeck and to do the work the two others had tried to do and\r\nmissed--demolish our ship. It broke before reaching us with a loud boom,\r\nmaking the sea a surging sheet of foam as white as snow for a long\r\ndistance. This was a beautiful sight. We gave a great shout of joy; we\r\nhad had a narrow escape.\r\n\r\nAfter these three heavy seas came a lull. The captain said thoughtfully,\r\n"Those are the waves that disable or founder ships and send them to the\r\nbottom of the sea!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I saw a big towering wave rolling towards the stern of\r\nthe ship."]\r\n\r\nWe were indeed still in the midst of a great gale. But the captain and\r\nour crew had thus far fought against the storm successfully. I thought\r\nof the great Viking Half, and of his champions. It was their custom\r\nalways to lie before capes, never to put up a tent on board, and never\r\nto reef a sail in a storm. Half had never more than sixty men on board\r\nof his ship, nor could any one go with him who was not so hardy that he\r\nnever was afraid or changed countenance on account of his wounds. I\r\nwondered if Half and his men had ever encountered such a storm as we\r\nwere having. If so his ship must have been a staunch vessel indeed.\r\n\r\nAs the hours passed the storm continued, the Daughters of \xc3\x86gir and Ran\r\nrose again and again, trying to strike our ship; when their hoods were\r\nrent asunder, their long hair streamed on the gale.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the dark clouds were lower than usual and moved rapidly\r\nover our heads. The wind howled and hissed through the rigging. Wave\r\nafter wave struck against the ship\'s side and deluged the deck with\r\nwater. One of them took me off my feet and pitched me to the other side\r\nagainst the bulwarks, almost washing me overboard.\r\n\r\n"You had better go into the cabin," said the captain; "this is no\r\nweather for you." But I replied, "Yes, captain, it is; I want to see\r\nthis big storm with its mighty sea." I had hardly said these words when\r\nanother wave came aboard of us. Two men were nearly washed overboard;\r\nfortunately they held fast to the rigging.\r\n\r\nSoon after another big wave struck our port side, and carried away a\r\npart of our bulwarks, swamping our decks with a huge mass of water; this\r\ntime nearly washing overboard all of us who were on deck. Looking at the\r\nhavoc the wave had wrought, I remembered the saga which tells of the\r\nstorm the celebrated Viking Fridthjof encountered at sea, and which\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n"Then came a wave breaking so strongly that it carried away the gunwales\r\nand part of the bow, and flung four men overboard, who were lost.\r\n\r\n"\'Now it is likely,\' said Fridthjof, \'that some of our men will visit\r\nRan. We shall not be thought fit to go there unless we prepare ourselves\r\nwell. I think it is right that every man should carry some gold with\r\nhim!\' He cut asunder the arm ring of his sweetheart Ingibj\xc3\xb6rg, and\r\ndivided it among his men."\r\n\r\nWe had been running before the wind with all the sails we could carry\r\nsafely, so that the ship might not be overtaken and swamped. As long as\r\nthe ship can sail faster or quite as fast as the waves, it is all right;\r\nbut if the waves go faster then there is great danger that the ship will\r\nbe pooped by the sea,--that is, that the seas may come over the stern,\r\nand sweep over the deck, carrying everything away. In such a case it\r\nhappens sometimes that all those who are on deck are swept overboard.\r\n\r\nThe sea finally became so high and so threatening that the captain\r\nordered that we should heave to and wait for the storm to abate. To\r\nheave a ship to before the wind is a dangerous manoeuvre. We waited\r\nuntil three big seas had passed. There is generally a lull after that,\r\nand then is the time to bring the ship\'s head to the wind. During the\r\nevolution the ship is liable to get in the trough of the sea, when she\r\nrolls heavily, and has her deck swept by the waves. The dangerous\r\noperation in our case proved successful.\r\n\r\nWhile our ship lay to we had just sail enough to keep her head to the\r\nwind, and she rode like a big albatross on the water, drifting a little\r\nto leeward. When she was in the hollow of two waves, these seemed like\r\nmountains ready to engulf us, but we rode safely over every one. As we\r\nlay to we felt perfectly secure. Our ship did not roll as if broadside\r\nto the seas, but pitched, rising slowly, over every wave.\r\n\r\nAfter lying to for over six hours, the storm having somewhat moderated,\r\nwe sailed east towards the shore; but before the day was over we\r\nencountered a cross-sea, the waves coming in every direction and\r\nstriking against each other. The man at the helm had to watch them.\r\nEvidently there had been two or three heavy storms blowing in different\r\ndirections. A cross-sea is very dangerous, for the man at the helm never\r\nknows where the wave will strike. After a while the wind shifted and was\r\nahead, and now we had to beat against it and we sailed under close\r\nreefed sails. The wind seemed ten times stronger than before, for when a\r\nship runs before the wind, the wind is not felt so much, as it goes with\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\nAs we came to a barren island, running parallel with the main land, we\r\nsaw the angry sea lashing itself with a tremendous force against the\r\nsolid base of mountain walls, filling the air each time it struck with a\r\ndeep booming sound which seemed like the roar of cannon heard far off;\r\nthe waves, as they struck the immovable wall of rocks which stopped\r\ntheir advance, breaking into a tumultuous mass of seething billows,\r\nwhich recoiled from the barrier that opposed them and fell back into a\r\nsurging, boiling mass of white which soon after was hurled forward again\r\nby another advancing wave rushing on to meet the same fate. The whole\r\ncoast was fringed as far as the eye could see with a mass of angry white\r\nbillows. It was an awful sight.\r\n\r\nSeamen dread the coast in a storm more than they do the waves in the\r\nmiddle of the ocean. We steered for the leeward of the island, and when\r\nwe reached the sound separating it from the main land we came into\r\nsmooth water where we cast anchor. We were to remain there until the\r\nstorm abated, to give a good rest to the crew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n A DARK NIGHT AT SEA.--WAKE OF THE _RAGNILD_.--THOUSANDS OF PHOSPHORESCENT\r\n     LIGHTS.--A LIGHT AHEAD.--AN ARCTIC FAIR.--A FISHING SETTLEMENT.--HOW\r\n     THE COD ARE CURED.--FISH AND FERTILIZER FRAGRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather having moderated, we raised our anchor and with a fair wind\r\ncontinued our voyage. When the night came it was so pitch-dark that I\r\ncould not distinguish the sea from the horizon and the sky. It was\r\nimpressive. I felt so little in the immensity that surrounded our craft.\r\nOur ship, to my eyes, when compared with the size of the ocean, was not\r\nbigger than a tiny hazelnut tossed to and fro upon it.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while the crest of a wave broke into a long snowy-white line\r\nwhich appeared to be filled with a thousand lights; this effect was\r\ncaused by the infinite number of animalcul\xc3\xa6, which are struck together\r\nby the movement of the wave and give out phosphorescence. These\r\nanimalcul\xc3\xa6 are living creatures which cannot be seen without the help of\r\nthe microscope. It is wonderful that such small things can give such\r\nglowing light.\r\n\r\nThe long heavy swells, pushed by the southerly gales that had passed\r\naway, moved irresistibly on towards the North, one after another, to\r\nbreak the wall of ice the Long Night had built round the pole. What\r\nterrific booming must take place there at times, when the ice gives way,\r\nbreaks up, and rises in great ridges over the Long Wall!\r\n\r\nA light at our masthead told of our presence to the mariners of the\r\nfishing boats, or the vessels coming from far northern ports across our\r\ncourse, and warned them of danger.\r\n\r\nOur ship ploughed her way through the sea, raising a mass of foam\r\nbrilliant with globules of light. These globules swept astern along the\r\nsides of the ship, and disappeared further on. We left behind us an\r\nundulating luminous wake, resembling a long bright snake following us,\r\nwhich was gradually in the distance engulfed by the ocean. This luminous\r\ntrack seemed to be reeled off from a windlass at the stern of the ship.\r\n\r\nAs I watched this white serpentine phosphorescent pathway, I thought of\r\nthe countless wakes that had been made in like manner since vessels\r\nsailed upon the seas, on their way to different lands, for thousands of\r\nyears past, yet not one of those tracks has ever been seen again. No\r\nwonder that the Norsemen called the sea "The Hidden Path."\r\n\r\nOn deck were four men on the watch, who guarded the lives of those who\r\nhad gone below to sleep. The man at the helm watched the compass, which\r\nwas lighted by a lamp. A man at the prow was on the lookout for sudden\r\ndanger--ships, derelicts, or rocks. Another stood amidships. The first\r\nmate paced the deck, watching for any change in the wind. Suddenly the\r\nman at the prow shouted:\r\n\r\n"Light on the starboard bow!" It was the light of a ship sailing in the\r\nopposite direction towards us. In a snowstorm, in a fog, we might have\r\ncollided; then both might have gone to the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nTo the leeward of us was the barren, forbidding coast; to the windward\r\nlay rocky islands. "Dear compass," I whispered, "we trust in thee; lead\r\nus right; the night is very dark, and our eyes cannot see rocks ahead,\r\nexcept, perchance, when it is too late."\r\n\r\nSuddenly the bell struck: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,\r\neight. It was midnight--time for the watch below to relieve the one on\r\nduty, and for the captain to take the place of the mate. Every four\r\nhours this change is made. I remained on deck, for I wanted to watch\r\nthis dark night.\r\n\r\nI came on deck early the next morning, for I smothered in the close\r\nconfined cabin--I had been so accustomed to the bracing open air. As I\r\nlooked around me I saw nothing but the great horizon which surrounded\r\nus. It had seemed so near every day, as we sailed towards it, and yet,\r\nno matter how long we sailed, we never came nearer. This was because the\r\nhorizon is the boundless space in the midst of which the earth moves on\r\nits axis round the sun.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we came to a place full of people dressed in furs. They\r\nwere Laplanders and Finlanders. A great fair was taking place, and most\r\nof the people had crossed the mountains to the Arctic Sea, taking with\r\nthem for sale reindeer meat, butter, cheese, reindeer cheese made in the\r\nsummer and autumn, frozen ptarmigans, skins of reindeer, bears, foxes,\r\nermines, and other animals; ready-made clothing, gloves and shoes of\r\nreindeer skin; hoofs of reindeer, and other things. They bought salted\r\nand dried codfish, sugar, coffee, salt, and other groceries, flour, lamp\r\noil, tobacco, and things for their wives and children, and took back\r\ncash with them.\r\n\r\nAfter a short stay we raised our anchor, and continued to sail along\r\nthat bleak coast until we came to a hidden harbor, well protected by a\r\nnumber of barren islands from the storms of the Arctic Ocean, and cast\r\nanchor before a large fishing settlement. It was the beginning of April.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange place indeed. The port was filled with fishing boats.\r\nHundreds of them were drawn up on the shore, and other hundreds were at\r\nanchor. There were also a number of good-sized vessels and smaller\r\ncraft. All along the rocky shore were huge piles of codfish caught that\r\nday. The water was crowded with boats moving in every direction, loaded\r\nwith cod.\r\n\r\nAlongside the big piles of fish, men dressed in wide trousers and\r\noveralls of leather were busy preparing the codfish. Some were cutting\r\nthe heads off and throwing them into a pile, while others were opening\r\nthe fish, cleaning them, and then, after flattening them, throwing them\r\nto other men, who salted them. After this operation they were carried to\r\nthe warehouses and were ready for drying.\r\n\r\nBy some of the piles men opened and cleaned the fish and tied them\r\ntogether by twos. After this they were hung on frames or poles. In other\r\nplaces the men divided the cod in halves, taking their spines out, but\r\nkept them connected by their gills. These were also hung on the poles.\r\nWhen dry the fish is as hard as wood.\r\n\r\nThe eggs or ova were put into barrels and salted, and Captain Ole\r\nPetersen, who was with me, said to me: "Each barrel contains the ova of\r\nthree hundred cod. They are sent to Italy and France and used in the\r\nsardine fisheries of those countries." Other men were busy putting the\r\nlivers into barrels, two barrels of fat liver yielding about one barrel\r\nof brown oil. The tongues of the cod were taken out of the heads, put\r\ninto barrels and salted.\r\n\r\nI visited the warehouses, built partly on piles projecting into the sea.\r\nAlong some of these were brigs and schooners loading.\r\n\r\nWhat a sight was the inside of these warehouses! They were filled with\r\nlong deep rows of freshly salted codfish, piled higher than a man and\r\nabout the same width. These fish were to be put on board ships and\r\nlanded upon rocks, there to stay until they were dried and ready to be\r\nshipped to foreign countries. The cod is the gold of the people living\r\non this desolate land.\r\n\r\nThe country around was covered with frames upon which fish were hanging.\r\nNets and lines were seen in every direction on the rocks, left to dry or\r\nready to be mended. Wherever I turned the place was saturated with the\r\nblood of fish and offal. The sea was covered with offal; thousands of\r\ngulls were flying in every direction and feeding upon it, while great\r\nnumbers of eider ducks, as tame as farm ducks, were swimming everywhere\r\nand feeding. They were not afraid, for no one is allowed to shoot them.\r\nThe bare rocks were black with hundreds of thousands of heads of cod\r\nthat had been put there to dry.\r\n\r\nThese heads, with the bones of fish, are turned into a fertilizer, or\r\nused to feed cattle. The heads are boiled before they are given to the\r\nanimals. "Cattle and sheep feeding on dried fish heads!" I exclaimed\r\nwith astonishment to my companion, "I never heard of this before."\r\n\r\nI asked one of the merchants how he could live in such a place. "The\r\natmosphere that brings money," he replied, "never smells bad. Where\r\nthere is no smell there is no business and no money with us."\r\n\r\nGoodness gracious! what a smell there was in this fishing settlement. It\r\nwas far from pleasant, especially when compared with the pure air of the\r\nland over which I had travelled.\r\n\r\nSeveral nice houses belonged to the merchants of the place. These were\r\npainted white and were very comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe cabins of the fishermen were scattered everywhere and were all\r\nalike. They were built of logs, with roofs covered with earth. I wanted\r\nto live with the fishermen and become acquainted with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n AMONG THE FISHERMEN.--THEIR LODGINGS AND HOW THEY LOOK.--WHAT THEY HAVE\r\n     TO EAT.--AN EVENING OF TALK ABOUT COD, SALMON, AND HERRING.--THE\r\n     IMMENSE NUMBER OF FISH.--A SNORING MATCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after Captain Petersen and I entered one of the houses of the\r\nfishermen. They had just returned from their fishing. I asked them if I\r\ncould live with them for a few days. "Yes," they all replied with one\r\nvoice. They knew Captain Petersen, I was with him: that was enough for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nStrange indeed was the room. Each fisherman\'s cabin had only one. The\r\nwall was surrounded by two rows of bunks, on top of each other. The room\r\nwas arranged like the forecastle of a ship.\r\n\r\n"Where are you from?" one of the fishermen asked me.\r\n\r\n"From America," I replied.\r\n\r\n"From America!" they all exclaimed at once. "Is that possible?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is from America," said Captain Petersen.\r\n\r\n"I have a brother in America, in Minnesota," exclaimed one.\r\n\r\nA second said: "I have a sister in Dakota."\r\n\r\nA third: "I also have a brother in America; he sails on the Great\r\nLakes."\r\n\r\nFrom that moment those fishermen and I were great friends. They asked me\r\nmy name. I replied, "My name is Paul Du Chaillu."\r\n\r\n"Why!" some of the younger fishermen said, "we have read in school the\r\ntranslation of your travels in Africa. Are you really he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight men, the crews of four boats, including the captains, lived\r\ntogether. A cooking-stove was in the centre of the room; a few wooden\r\nbenches and a table composed the rest of the furniture, while a number\r\nof chests contained the garments of the men, several coffee kettles, a\r\npan and a big pot, etc.\r\n\r\nAll these twenty-eight men insisted that I should have a whole bunk to\r\nmyself--the occupant would shift and go to another fellow. I must be\r\ncomfortable, they said. I was not accustomed to living in their way.\r\n\r\nA man took his things from his bunk. He was the captain of one of the\r\nboats. He said to me: "Paul, my bunk is yours." I had to accept.\r\n\r\nWhen they had cooked their meal, they said: "Paul, eat with us simple\r\nfisher folk; we will give you the best we have; you are welcome." We had\r\nonly one dish, and it was entirely new to me.\r\n\r\nIt was what the sailors called lobscouse, a sort of pudding made of ship\r\nbiscuits, liver, and fish. I did not care much for it, but I said\r\nnothing to the fishermen. One said: "We eat this dish every day, and\r\nthat will be your food when you are with us."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" I said to myself. I remembered the elephants, the crocodiles,\r\nthe snakes, and the monkeys, etc., I had had to eat while in Africa. The\r\nmonkeys when fat were fine, and tasted so good I should have been\r\nwilling to exchange a dish of lobscouse for a monkey.\r\n\r\nAfter our meal we had coffee; each man owned his own cup. "We drink only\r\ncoffee," they said, "for no spirits are allowed to be sold here, for\r\nfear some of the men while going to sea might become drunk, and endanger\r\ntheir lives, and the lives of those that are with them."\r\n\r\nOur coffee drunk, we talked first about fish and their peculiar habits.\r\nThe names of the four captains were John Ericksen, Hakon Johansen, Ole\r\nLarsen, Harald Andersen.\r\n\r\n"Every spring," said Captain Ole, "salmon come up from the sea and\r\nascend our rivers to spawn, and in time the little ones go to sea. As\r\nthey grow up they continue to come every year to the same river where\r\nthey were born, and nobody knows where they spend the interval."\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, during which the fishermen filled their pipes, Captain\r\nEricksen said: "Every year the codfish make their appearance in winter\r\nin vast shoals and countless millions on the Lofoden Islands banks to\r\nspawn. Then they migrate further north to the coast of Finmarken, then\r\neastward as far as Russia. Then they disappear until the following\r\nwinter. No one knows where they come from or where they go."\r\n\r\nOne of the men observed: "I have been a fisherman for over forty years,\r\nand it is wonderful how regularly the cod make their appearance on the\r\nfishing banks. We depend so much on their time of coming that we leave\r\nhome every year at the same date. They must know their way in the ocean\r\nand recognize different marks on their journey, for they have to travel\r\nthousands of miles before they return to the fishing banks to spawn. The\r\ncod in their migration leave behind them a great many stragglers, which\r\nare caught all the year round. The number of cod caught on the banks of\r\nFinmarken and of the Lofoden Islands averages about forty to forty-two\r\nmillions a year, and the total catch along the coasts of Norway amounts\r\nto about fifty millions a year. The land is barren, and if it were not\r\nfor the fish we could not live in our country."\r\n\r\n"Fifty millions of cod is a great number," I observed.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied, "but these fifty millions are nothing but a small\r\nfraction compared with the great number that are not caught."\r\n\r\nAfter our talk on the cod was finished, Captain Ericksen spoke about\r\nherrings as follows: "If the number of codfish caught is great, the\r\nnumber of herring is far greater. The herrings make their appearance in\r\nimmense shoals, and it is beyond the power and calculation of man to\r\nguess their number, for their millions are countless. The migration of\r\nthe herring is often very irregular. They appear generally from January\r\nto March. The herring are known to have disappeared for years in some\r\ndistricts, then suddenly reappear."\r\n\r\n"That is strange," I said. "Can you account for that?"\r\n\r\n"No," the captain replied; "if I were a herring I probably could tell."\r\nWe all laughed when he said this.\r\n\r\nI remarked: "The number of Norwegian fishing boats is so great, how do\r\nyou know when some are missing and have foundered at sea?"\r\n\r\nCaptain Ericksen replied: "Every fishing district has its own letter on\r\neach boat belonging to it, and a number, and the name of every man\r\ncomposing its crew is registered; also his residence, the day of his\r\nbirth, etc. This is necessary, for every year some poor fisherman\'s boat\r\nis lost and the crew drowned; thus the boat and crew missing can be\r\nidentified. All the Norwegian men you see at the fisheries have\r\nhomes--humble it is true--either on the fjords, by the coast, or on some\r\nlittle islands where there are a few patches of land which they can\r\ncultivate, raise potatoes and some grain, and where there is grass\r\nenough to keep a cow or two, sometimes more, some goats, and a few sheep\r\nto give us wool.\r\n\r\n"That is the reason you see us so warmly clad. Our wives, daughters, or\r\nsisters, while we are absent from home think of us. They spin and weave\r\nthe wool from our sheep into outer garments and underwear, knit\r\nstockings for us, and with some of the money we get from our catch of\r\nfish we buy waterproof clothing. With a good part of the money we save\r\nwe buy things for our family and the provisions that we need, and put\r\nthe rest in the bank."\r\n\r\nIt was time to retire, for we had to start up at five in the morning, if\r\nthe weather permitted, for the fishing bank. It was agreed among the\r\nfishermen that I should go net-fishing in the boat owned by Captain Ole.\r\nWhat music we had during the night! All the fishermen snored. I thought\r\nI had never heard such a snoring before! I amused myself by wondering\r\nwhich one of them would have received the prize had it been a snoring\r\nmatch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n DEPARTURE FOR THE FISHING BANKS.--GREAT NUMBER OF BOATS.--MORE THAN FIVE\r\n     THOUSAND OARS FALL INTO THE WATER AT THE SAME TIME.--QUANTITIES OF\r\n     BUOYS AND GLASS BALLS.--A NOTABLE CATCH OF COD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt four o\'clock the next morning we were up. It was the dawn of the day.\r\nIt was wonderful how quickly the nights shortened. Coffee, flat bread,\r\nbutter, and cheese made our breakfast.\r\n\r\nWhen we came out almost all the boats with their full crews were ready\r\nwaiting for the hoisting of the flag at five o\'clock, which is the\r\nsignal for the start, the time changing according to the length of the\r\nday. We all had to leave together, and to return the same day. Every\r\none, including myself, was dressed in oilskin garments, sou\'wester, and\r\nhigh sea-boots. There were more than nine hundred fishing boats. As soon\r\nas the flag was hoisted over five thousand oars struck the water at the\r\nsame time, and filled the air with a deep booming sound. I had never\r\nseen so many sea boats and oars together. It was a grand sight!\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were out of the harbor the boats hoisted their sails, and\r\nsoon we were scattered in every direction, each boat going towards its\r\nbuoys. I looked at the thousands of white sails with wonder.\r\n\r\nOur fishing boat was a fine craft, forty-two feet long and about seven\r\nfeet and a half beam. The poop was decked under for a cabin, with bunks\r\nfor the men to sleep in. The rudder-like oar, several feet long, is held\r\nby the captain, who sculls and steers at the same time.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ole was a regular "old salt." Our crew was composed of Sven,\r\nHakon, Fridthjof, Ivor, Evert, Harald and Erik. Evert and Harald were\r\nlads about seventeen years old; they were learning to be hardy sailors\r\nlike their father.\r\n\r\nAfter a sail of three hours\' beating against the wind, we came to the\r\nfishing banks and towards our buoys. The water for as far as I could see\r\nwas filled with buoys and glass balls (floaters to hold the nets)\r\nenclosed in netted ropes. These glass balls were attached by a short\r\ncord to the nets to keep them floating, while stones at the bottom held\r\nthe nets stretched. It was no easy matter to sail among them.\r\n\r\nLooking at the multitudes of buoys I asked Captain Ole, "How can you\r\never find and recognize your own buoys?"\r\n\r\nHe answered smiling, "We can find our nets by the bearings, and every\r\nbuoy has its special mark of ownership. It is hard work to haul in the\r\nnets, especially when the sea is rough. Each net is one hundred and\r\ntwenty fathoms long, and about three fathoms deep;--we sailors do not\r\ncount by yards but by fathoms. Each fathom is six feet long. In our boat\r\nwe have to raise twenty-four nets tied together in fours."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "It is hard work to haul in the nets."]\r\n\r\n"I will help you all I can," I replied; "I am willing to work. I have\r\ncome to sea and I am in your boat as one of the crew, and I will try to\r\ndo my part. I hope we are going to have good luck, and that the catch of\r\ncod will be big."\r\n\r\nTo Evert and Hakon was assigned the duty of pulling in the nets. Two\r\nother men stowed the nets carefully. Near the net-reels were two men who\r\nhooked the fish as they appeared and threw them inside of the boat, and\r\nanother man and I arranged the nets. How eager we were as the nets were\r\nhauled up to peep and see how plentiful the fish were; for these\r\nrepresented money--and the poor fishermen work so hard to get a\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\nThe sea was rough and it took us about ten minutes to haul each net.\r\nAfter they were all in, we estimated that we had caught about eight\r\nhundred codfish. This was considered a very fine catch. Then a\r\nconsultation was held to decide where to re-set the nets. It was very\r\nimportant to know the direction in which the fish had gone on the banks,\r\nfor these big shoals were constantly moving as they spawned.\r\n\r\nAfter they had decided where to go our sail was hoisted, and we started\r\nfor another part of the fishing banks; in the mean time the nets were\r\ninspected and put into good order. When we reached the spot, we sounded\r\ntwice and found the sea too deep. When we found a depth of one hundred\r\nfathoms we set our nets, after which we returned home.\r\n\r\nOn our return we went on board of one of the ships, and our fish was\r\nbought by the captain at a little over eight dollars a "big\r\nhundred,"--that is, 112 cod.\r\n\r\nOn the deck of this ship were already several boat-loads of cod; the\r\nfish were cleaned, flattened, washed and salted, and laid in the hold on\r\nthe top of one another.\r\n\r\nThe captain said to me: "When I am loaded I shall sail for my farm, and\r\nthen lay the fish on the rocks to dry. I have a nice little home by the\r\nsea. I hope my boys will one of these days be sailors as I am." Then we\r\nshook hands with the captain and returned to our cabin.\r\n\r\nBefore we went to bed we learned that the catch of all the boats of the\r\nsettlement that day had been over six hundred thousand cod.\r\n\r\nThe following morning found me ready to start at the appointed time for\r\nfishing with hook and line. The departure of the boats took place in the\r\nsame manner as the day before. Our boat was not so large as the netting\r\nboat; it was not decked over.\r\n\r\nCaptain Johansen steered. The men of our crew were Mats, Pehr, Anders,\r\nOle, Knut, and Roar.\r\n\r\nCaptain Johansen had fished in the Arctic regions for forty-two\r\nconsecutive years. His face had been permanently reddened by the wind.\r\nWhenever he had a chance he had his pipe in his mouth, and he told me\r\nthat his pipe was one of his best friends.\r\n\r\nWe had a fair wind at the start and in about one hour the men came to\r\ntheir buoys. Then we lowered the sail. The sea was covered with boats;\r\nthere were nearly fifteen hundred in sight, for they had come to that\r\npart of the banks from several other fishing settlements. These boats\r\nwere manned by about eleven thousand sailors; men enough to man a big\r\nfleet of men-of-war.\r\n\r\nCaptain Johansen said: "We are going to have hard work raising our\r\nlines, but if we catch many fish the work will seem to be much lighter\r\nto us."\r\n\r\n"That is so," I said, "Captain, for when I go hunting and see no game I\r\nget tired; but if I see plenty of game, then I can tramp all day without\r\nfatigue."\r\n\r\nA large reel was placed on one side of the boat to haul in the line.\r\nBefore we began to haul the lines the captain remarked: "We attach four\r\nlines together; each line is one hundred fathoms long. The hooks are\r\ngenerally from four to six feet apart and there are about one hundred\r\nand twenty on each line. We have to pull in over twenty-four hundred\r\nfathoms or over twenty-six thousand feet of line, to which are attached\r\nabout five thousand hooks."\r\n\r\n"Indeed," I said to the captain, "it will be hard work and will take\r\nquite a while, especially if many fish are caught."\r\n\r\n"I hope, nevertheless, we shall catch many," he replied with a smile,\r\n"for most of us have a home to keep and a wife and children to clothe\r\nand feed."\r\n\r\nWe began to haul in the lines on the reel. How we watched! How deep our\r\neyes tried to see into the water! It was quite exciting. We were\r\nfortunate: a big shoal of fish had been passing on that part of the\r\nbanks, and on many a hook a cod was hanging. After we got through, we\r\npulled towards another of our buoys, passing several that belonged to\r\nother fishermen on the way.\r\n\r\nHaving pulled in about three hundred fathoms of our next line, we found\r\nthat the rest of the line had drifted into a net and some of the hooks\r\nwere caught and entangled in it, and we had a hard job to free the line.\r\n\r\nThen we rowed to a third buoy belonging to us and began hauling. Almost\r\nevery other hook had caught a fish. The faces of the fishermen were full\r\nof happiness. They felt that on that day they would have a great catch,\r\nwhen suddenly one of the men shouted, "Our line is entangled; I wonder\r\nwhether it has fouled a net or another line." But as we pulled in the\r\nline we raised another line with it not belonging to us. We had a hard\r\ntime to separate them, but after nearly half an hour\'s work succeeded in\r\ndoing so. We had caught over two hundred cod on this line.\r\n\r\nOur fourth line proved to be entangled in nets as well as also in\r\nseveral lines belonging to different owners. The untwisting was\r\nsomething awful, and it was no joke to separate them. Fortunately we\r\ncould tell to whom the lines belonged, for each one is marked from\r\ndistance to distance with the number of the boat and the letter of the\r\ndistrict from which the craft comes. The rest of the lines were so badly\r\ntangled that we concluded to cut them. Then we pulled the cut pieces\r\nwith the fish on them into our boat, intending to give them to their\r\nowners--not a difficult task, as the marks of ownership were on the\r\ntackles--and if they belonged to another settlement the fish would be\r\nsold and the money given them.\r\n\r\nCaptain Johansen and the crew thought the cod would remain two days\r\nmore. Their advance guard had passed, but a great deal of the shoal was\r\ngoing northward; and there were miles of cod still to pass over the bank\r\nupon which we fished.\r\n\r\nThe wind had been gradually rising. We had had two days of good weather,\r\nand now the sea was covered with white caps. The daughters of \xc3\x86gir and\r\nRan were all white-hooded. But as we sailed for home the wind suddenly\r\nincreased; squall after squall followed each other. We had to reef the\r\nsail; the sea at times washed over us, and the poor fishermen began to\r\nthink seriously of throwing our cargo of fish overboard, for we were\r\npretty deeply loaded, but it would have been like throwing away money,\r\nand they had worked so hard to get it.\r\n\r\nA big black cloud overspread our heads and hail fell thickly upon us,\r\nand it hurt us badly for the hailstones were hard and very big. I tried\r\nto protect my face, for my sou\'wester only protected well the back of my\r\nhead. The hail was succeeded by sleet, the rigging and mast were covered\r\nwith ice; our garments and sou\'westers were stiff, and we looked like\r\nbig icy things. The captain, looking at me with a smile,--for he saw I\r\ndid not like this sort of weather, said: "This weather is the\r\nforerunner of spring in these high latitudes; the sun is getting higher\r\nat its meridian every day."\r\n\r\nIt was dark long before we reached port, but the men knew every rock on\r\nthe coast, and yonder was the lighthouse guiding us on our way. Boat\r\nafter boat entered the harbor, and not one of them was lost.\r\n\r\nThe next day the gale was such that no boat was permitted to put out to\r\nsea. In the evening there was very little talking, and for a while no\r\none said a word; then Captain Johansen broke the silence and said:\r\n"Paul, this Arctic Ocean is the home of gales; these often bring sadness\r\nto many homes; some of us here have lost friends and relatives at sea.\r\nSome years ago a fishing fleet of eight hundred boats was caught in one\r\nof these sudden gales. After the boats had come safely into port the\r\nroll-call showed that twenty boats with their crews were missing."\r\n\r\n"How sad!" I exclaimed; and as Captain Johansen was speaking I wondered\r\nhow many people thought, when they ate fish, of the hard life of the\r\npoor and brave fishermen and of the gales they encounter.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen wanted to entertain me before we retired for the night,\r\nand Captain Larsen said, "I will tell you, Paul, about one of the great\r\nsea battles of the Vikings."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n A GREAT VIKING SEA FIGHT.--SVEIN KING OF DENMARK, OLAF KING OF SWEDEN,\r\n     ERIK JARL OF NORWAY, AGAINST KING OLAF TRYGGVASSON OF NORWAY.--THEY\r\n     LIE IN AMBUSH.--MAGNIFICENT SHIPS.--THE _LONG SERPENT_.--READY FOR\r\n     THE FIGHT.--THE ATTACK.--THE _JARN BARDI_.--DEFEAT OF OLAF\r\n     TRYGGVASSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter we had clustered round Captain Larsen, he gave three or four big\r\npuffs of his pipe and began:\r\n\r\nThe battle of Svold took place in the year one thousand. Olaf\r\nTryggvasson, King of Norway, had left Vindland in the Baltic and was on\r\nhis way back to Norway with his fleet. He was on his ship the _Ormrinn\r\nLange_ (the "Long Serpent"). Svein, the King of Denmark, Olaf King of\r\nSweden, and Erik Jarl of Norway, his enemies, lay in ambush for him\r\nunder the island of Svold with all their ships. The three chiefs landed\r\non the island. After a while they espied some ships of the fleet of\r\nOlaf. Among them was a particularly large and splendid one. Both kings\r\nsaid: "This is an exceedingly fine ship; it must be the _Long Serpent_."\r\n\r\nErik Jarl, who knew the _Long Serpent_, answered: "This is not the _Long\r\nSerpent_, which is much larger and grander, though this is a fine\r\nship."\r\n\r\nShip after ship passed by and the two kings took each of them to be the\r\n_Long Serpent_, but they received invariably the same answer from Erik\r\nJarl.\r\n\r\nThe three chiefs drew lots to know who should first attack Olaf\r\nTryggvasson\'s ship. Svein, King of Denmark, drew the lot to attack\r\nfirst; then Olaf, King of Sweden, and Erik Jarl last, if it should be\r\nfound necessary. It was agreed between the three chiefs that each should\r\nown the ships which he himself cleared of men and captured.\r\n\r\nErik Jarl\'s ship was called the _Jarn Bardi_, an iron-clad ram which had\r\nthe reputation of cleaving through every ship it attacked; there were\r\nbeaks on the top of both stem and stern, and below these were thick iron\r\nplates which covered the whole of the stem and stern all the way down to\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nWhen the chiefs had arranged their plan, they saw three very large\r\nships, and following them a fourth; they all saw a dragon-head on the\r\nstem, ornamented so that it seemed of pure gold, and it gleamed far and\r\nwide over the sea as the sun shone on it. As they looked at the ship,\r\nthey wondered greatly at its length, for the stern did not appear till\r\nlong after they had seen the prow, as the ship glided past the point of\r\nthe island slowly; then all knew that this was the _Long Serpent_--a\r\nship about three hundred and sixty feet long, with a crew of over seven\r\nhundred and fifty men.\r\n\r\nAt this sight many a man grew silent.\r\n\r\nSigvaldi Jarl, one of Olaf Tryggvasson\'s commanders, let down the sails\r\non his ship and rowed up towards the island. Thorkel Dydril on the\r\n_Tranan_ (the "Crane"), and the other ship-steerers (for the commanders\r\nwere so called), lowered their sails also and followed him. All waited\r\nfor Olaf Tryggvasson. When King Olaf saw that his men had lowered their\r\nsails and were waiting for him, he steered towards them and asked them\r\nwhy they did not go on. They told him that a host of foes was before\r\nthem and that the fleets of the allied kings lay around the point.\r\n\r\nAdvancing further the King Olaf Tryggvasson and his men saw that the sea\r\nwas covered far and wide with the warships of his foes. Thorkel Dydril,\r\na wise and valiant man, said: "Lord, here is an overwhelming force to\r\nfight against: let us hoist our sails and follow our men out to sea. We\r\ncan still do so while our foes prepare themselves for battle, for it is\r\nnot looked upon as cowardice by any one for a man to use forethought for\r\nhimself and his men." King Olaf Tryggvasson\'s men now missed the ships\r\nthat had sailed ahead.\r\n\r\nKing Olaf replied loudly: "Tie together the ships and let the men\r\nprepare for battle!" for in those days it was the custom to tie the\r\nships together. Then the commanders arranged the host.\r\n\r\nThe _Long Serpent_ was in the middle, with the _Short Serpent_ on one\r\nside and the _Crane_ on the other, and four other ships on each side of\r\nthem; but this fleet was but a small one compared with the overwhelming\r\nfleet which their enemies had.\r\n\r\nWhen Olaf saw that they began to tie together the stern of the _Long\r\nSerpent_ and of the _Short Serpent_, he called out loudly, "Bring the\r\n_Long Serpent_ forward; I will not be the hindmost of all my men in this\r\nfleet when the battle begins!"\r\n\r\nThen Ulf ("Wolf") the Red, the king\'s standard bearer, and who was also\r\nhis prow-defender, said: "If the _Long Serpent_ shall be put as much\r\nforward as it is larger and longer than other ships, the men in the bows\r\nwill have a hard time of it!"\r\n\r\nThe king cried: "I had the _Serpent_ made longer than other ships so\r\nthat it should be put forward more boldly in battle, but I did not know\r\nI had a prow-defender who was faint-hearted!"\r\n\r\nUlf replied: "Turn thou, King, no more back in defending the high deck\r\nthan I will in defending the prow!"\r\n\r\nOlaf Tryggvasson stood aloft on the high deck of the _Long Serpent_. He\r\nhad a shield, and gilt helmet, and was easily recognized. He wore a red\r\nsilk kirtle over his ring-armor.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw that the ships of his foes began to separate, and that the\r\nstandards were raised in front of each chief, he asked: "Who is the\r\nchief of that standard which is opposite us?" He was told that it was\r\nKing Svein of Denmark with the Danish ships.\r\n\r\n"What chief follows the standard which is to the right?" He was told\r\nthat it was Olaf of Sweden.\r\n\r\n"Who owns those large ships to the left of King Olaf of Sweden?"\r\n\r\n"It is Erik Jarl Hakonson," they replied.\r\n\r\nThen Svein of Denmark, Olaf of Sweden, and Erik Jarl rowed towards the\r\n_Long Serpent_.\r\n\r\nThe battle horns were blown and both sides shouted a war-cry, and soon\r\nthe combat raged fiercely,--at first with arrows from crossbows and long\r\nbows, then with spears and javelins and slings--and King Olaf\r\nTryggvasson fought most manfully. King Svein\'s men turned the prows of\r\nmany of their ships towards both sides of the _Long Serpent_. The Danes\r\nalso attacked the _Short Serpent_ and the _Crane_. The carnage was\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nKing Svein made the stoutest onset. King Olaf Tryggvasson made the\r\nbravest defence with his men, but they fell one after another. King Olaf\r\nfought almost too boldly, shooting arrows and hurling spears; he went\r\nforward in hand-to-hand fight, and cleft many a man\'s skull with his\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nThe attack proved difficult for the Danes, for the stern-defenders of\r\nthe _Long Serpent_ and of the _Short Serpent_ hooked anchors and\r\ngrappling hooks to King Svein\'s ships, and as they could strike down\r\nupon the enemy with their weapons, for they had much larger and higher\r\nboarded ships, they cleared of men all the Danish ships which they had\r\nlaid hold of. King Svein had to retreat.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Erik Jarl had come first with the _Jarn Bardi_\r\nalongside the farthest ship of Olaf Tryggvasson on one wing, cleared it,\r\nand cut it from the fastenings; he then boarded the next one, and fought\r\nuntil it was cleared of men; and as the men fell on his ship, other\r\nDanes and Swedes took their places. At last all of Olaf Tryggvasson\'s\r\nships had been cleared of men and captured except the _Long Serpent_,\r\nwhich carried all the men who were now able to fight.\r\n\r\nErik Jarl then attacked the _Long Serpent_ with five large ships; he\r\nlaid the _Jarn Bardi_ alongside, and then ensued the fiercest fight and\r\nthe most terrible hand-to-hand struggle of the day, and such a shower of\r\nweapons was poured upon the _Long Serpent_ that the men could hardly\r\nprotect themselves.\r\n\r\nKing Olaf Tryggvasson\'s men became so furious that they jumped upon the\r\ngunwales in order to reach their foes with their swords and kill them,\r\nand many went straight overboard; for out of eagerness and daring they\r\nforgot that they were not fighting on dry ground, and sank down with\r\ntheir weapons between the ships.\r\n\r\nWhen only a few men were left on the _Long Serpent_ around the mast\r\namidships, Erik Jarl boarded it with fourteen men. Then came against him\r\nKing Olaf\'s brother-in-law, Hyrning, with his followers, and between\r\nthem ensued a hard fight. It was ended by Erik Jarl\'s retreating onto\r\nthe _Bardi_, which took away the dead and the wounded, and in their\r\nstead brought fresh and rested men.\r\n\r\nWhen Erik had prepared his men, he said to Thorkel the High, a wise and\r\npowerful chief: "Often have I been in battles, and never have I before\r\nfound men equally brave and so skilled in fighting as those on the _Long\r\nSerpent_, nor have I seen a ship so hard to conquer. Now, as thou art\r\none of the wisest of men, give me the best advice thou knowest as to how\r\nthe _Long Serpent_ may be won!"\r\n\r\nThorkel replied: "I cannot give thee sure advice, but I can say what\r\nseems to me best to do. Thou must take large timbers, and let them fall\r\nfrom thy ship upon the gunwales of the _Long Serpent_, so that it will\r\ncareen; then thou wilt find it the easier to board the ship."\r\n\r\nErik Jarl did as Thorkel had told him.\r\n\r\nKing Olaf and his men defended themselves with the utmost bravery and\r\nmanliness; they slew many of their foes, both on the _Jarn Bardi_ and on\r\nother ships which lay near theirs.\r\n\r\nWhen the defenders of the _Long Serpent_ began to thin out, Erik Jarl\r\nboarded it and met with a warm reception.\r\n\r\nOlaf Tryggvasson shot at him with spears. The first flew past his right\r\nside, the second his left, and the third struck the fore part of the\r\nship above his head.\r\n\r\nThen King Olaf said: "Never before did I thus miss a man; great is the\r\nJarl\'s luck."\r\n\r\nIn a short time most of King Olaf\'s champions fell, though they were\r\nboth strong and valiant. Among them Hyrning, Thorgier, Vikar, and Ulf\r\nthe Red, and many other brave men who left a famous name behind. The\r\n_Long Serpent_ was now cleared of men and captured, but Olaf Tryggvasson\r\nwas never seen or heard of more. He probably threw himself into the sea\r\nnot to survive his defeat.\r\n\r\n"It was a grand fight, Captain Larsen!" I exclaimed, as the narrator\r\nconcluded his story. I thanked the captain, and after this we all went\r\nto our bunks to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe following day was Sunday. There was no buying or selling of fish.\r\nEvery man was shaved and wore clean linen; the church was crowded with\r\nfishermen, and the afternoon was spent in making social visits.\r\n\r\nI had fished with the four boats of our house, and now I made my\r\npreparations for sailing northward. Our catch of fish and that in\r\nseveral neighboring fishing settlements during the fishing season had\r\namounted to over twenty-two millions of cod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n SAILING ALONG THE COAST OF FINMARKEN.--HAMMERFEST, THE MOST NORTHERN\r\n     TOWN IN THE WORLD.--SCHOOLS.--FRUHOLMEN, THE MOST NORTHERN LIGHTHOUSE\r\n     IN THE WORLD.--AMONG THE SEA LAPPS.--MEN AND WOMEN SAILORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving the fishing settlement, the _Ragnild_, which I had rejoined,\r\nsailed along the rugged and dreary shore of Finmarken, the most northern\r\npart of the continent of Europe, passing now and then a solitary\r\nfisherman\'s house, or a settlement hidden from sight, though the\r\nstranger would never dream that any human being lived in this land of\r\nrocks and desolation.\r\n\r\nWe next came to Hammerfest, in 70\xc2\xb0 40\' north latitude, the most northern\r\ntown in the world. In its commodious port were English, French, Russian,\r\nGerman, Swedish, and Norwegian vessels. Hundreds of fishing boats were\r\nthere also, waiting for favorable winds to continue their voyage.\r\nSteamers were going and coming from the south.\r\n\r\nThe population was about three thousand souls. There were warehouses\r\nowned by rich merchants, a church, a comfortable hotel, good schools\r\nwhere boys and girls can learn French, English, German, Latin and\r\nGreek.\r\n\r\nThe streets were filled with snow. But though so far north there was not\r\na particle of ice in the port, on account of the warm Gulf Stream,\r\nthough sometimes the thermometer reaches 20 degrees below zero. Often\r\nduring the winter the mercury stands for consecutive days above the\r\nfreezing point.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Hammerfest we sailed towards North Cape. Suddenly I heard\r\none of the sailors on the watch shout, "Light! Light!" "What," said I,\r\n"a lighthouse so far north?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied the captain, who was standing near me; "it is the most\r\nnorthern light on the globe. It is the light on the island of Fruholmen,\r\nsituated in latitude 71\xc2\xb0 5\' north." We sailed as far as North Cape, on\r\nthe island of Mager\xc3\xb6, rising majestically to a height of nine hundred\r\nand eighty feet above the sea, and in latitude 71\xc2\xb0 10\'. At the top of\r\nthe cape there was evidently a gale, for the snow was flying to a great\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nAs we were sailing along the shore, I saw some strange-looking\r\nweather-beaten logs, covered with barnacles. The captain said to me,\r\n"Some of these logs come probably from the coast of South America, from\r\nthe Amazon and Orinoco rivers; the Gulf Stream has brought them here. It\r\nhas taken them a long time to reach this place, for they are covered\r\nwith barnacles."\r\n\r\nInstead of doubling North Cape, we sailed through the narrow Mager\xc3\xb6\r\nSound which separates the island from the mainland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "We sailed towards North Cape."]\r\n\r\nWe had hardly entered the sound when I was astonished by the view that\r\nmet my eyes, for now there were fishing settlements coming suddenly into\r\nview, with comfortable, white-painted houses, ships at anchor,\r\nglittering churches shining in the sun, and school buildings.\r\n\r\nWe sailed across the Porsanger Fjord. Far off was Nordkyn, upon the\r\nsummit of which I had stood. The coast looked dreary indeed! We sailed\r\nacross Laxe Fjord and doubled Nordkyn.\r\n\r\nThe following day we entered a fjord and came upon a number of fishing\r\nboats that were returning from the open sea. Some of these boats rowed\r\ntowards us, and soon were alongside of our craft, and we engaged in\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nThese people appeared very strange; they were dressed like the nomadic\r\nLapps, with the noteworthy exception, however, that the fur of the\r\nreindeer skin was on the _inside_ of their garments. They were Sea\r\nLapps.\r\n\r\nI looked at the crews of the boats, and was more astonished still, for\r\nsome of the boats were partly manned by women, and big girls; other\r\ncrews were entirely composed of women with a man for captain. One boat\r\nwas entirely manned by women, the captain included. I could not easily\r\ndistinguish the men from the women, for the features of the women were\r\ncoarse from exposure to the storms of the Arctic Sea. They wore reindeer\r\ntrousers like the men, as indeed do the women of the nomadic Lapps. They\r\nrowed quite as well as the men, too. They were distinguishable by their\r\nlong shaggy hair. It was of a dark chestnut, with a reddish\r\ntinge--almost black in some. They wore it hanging over their shoulders.\r\nIt was indeed a strange sight, and I looked at them with great\r\ncuriosity, for I had never seen such people before--women who were\r\nsailors, some captains of boats, going to sea and braving the storms of\r\nthe inhospitable ocean.\r\n\r\nCaptain Petersen said to me: "Almost all these sea Laplanders own their\r\ncrafts. Some of these are commanded by the husband, while the wife, the\r\ndaughters, sister or hired woman form the crew; the women are very\r\nhardy, and excellent sailors; they pull as hard as strong men, and can\r\nuse the oar as long as the men do."\r\n\r\nThe captain was right--for I could not see any difference between their\r\nrowing and that of the men as they followed us.\r\n\r\nWhen they learned that I had come to see their land and wanted to live\r\namong them, they were glad. They asked my name, and they were told that\r\nI was called Paulus.\r\n\r\nThen many of these Sea Lapps said:\r\n\r\n"Come, Paulus, and stay a few days with us; we will take good care of\r\nyou;" and pointing to a hamlet at a distance, "there we live, and soon\r\nwe shall be at home."\r\n\r\nLooking towards where they pointed, I saw smoke curling up from\r\nstrange-looking dwellings. The settlement was scattered on the brow of\r\na hill looking down upon the fjord.\r\n\r\nAs the word went round that I was coming to stay with them, the Sea\r\nLapps made haste and rowed with all their might; the women were\r\nespecially in earnest, for they wanted to prepare their houses for my\r\nreception before I landed. Soon they all were far ahead, and after they\r\nhad landed I saw them running as fast as they could towards their homes.\r\nEvidently they were going to announce my arrival to the people who had\r\nremained at home.\r\n\r\nHere I parted with the _Ragnild_, which sailed to another fjord for more\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n A SEA LAPP HAMLET.--STRANGE HOUSES.--THEIR INTERIORS.--SUMMER DRESS OF\r\n     THE SEA LAPPS.--PRIMITIVE WOODEN CART.--ANIMALS EAT RAW FISH.--I\r\n     SLEEP IN A SEA LAPP\'S HOUSE.--THEY TELL ME TO HURRY SOUTHWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I had landed, and ascended the hill towards the settlement, I found\r\nmyself in a Sea Lapp hamlet. I looked at their dwellings with great\r\ncuriosity. Some of the buildings were conical and resembled the tent of\r\nthe nomadic Lapps; but they were built of sod or turf. There were others\r\nresembling in shape log houses, with only a ground floor, built entirely\r\nof the same material. Others were partly of stone and turf. Some were\r\nentirely of stone slabs. Two houses were built of logs.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the people had changed their clothes, and wore their\r\nsummer every-day dress called _vuolpo_ (though it was still cold), ready\r\nto receive me.\r\n\r\nSome of these summer dresses were made of coarse vadmal of a gray or\r\nblackish color; others were blue. Most were in a ragged state, or\r\npatched--having when new been used as Sunday clothes. The men wore\r\nsquare caps of red or blue flannel, and the women had extraordinary\r\nlooking head-gear resembling casques of dragoons, on account of the\r\nwooden frame under the cloth. These were also red or blue.\r\n\r\n"Come in," said one of the Sea Lapps, "come into my _gamme_ (house) and\r\nsee how I live." His house was of conical shape and built of sod,\r\nsupported inside by a rough frame formed of branches of trees. A fire\r\nwas burning in the centre of the hut, the smoke escaping by an aperture\r\nabove; and upon cross poles hung shoes, boots, and clothing. This sod\r\nhut was about twelve feet high and eight feet in diameter. A large\r\nkettle hung over the fire. It was filled with seaweed, which was cooking\r\nfor the cows. I tasted it and found it very palatable and not at all\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nI was hardly in this _gamme_ when I wished myself out, but kept this to\r\nmyself, for I did not want to hurt the feelings of the poor Lapp. The\r\ninterior of the place was horribly filthy--dirty reindeer skins lay on\r\nthe ground upon old dirty dried grass. A tent of a nomadic Lapp was a\r\nmodel of cleanliness compared with this! The outside was just as bad; on\r\nthe ground lay the entrails and heads of fish, and a couple of barrels\r\nfilled with half-putrid liver which in time would make a barrel of brown\r\noil; there were a great many codfish heads drying on the rocks.\r\n\r\n"Will you stay and have a cup of coffee with us?" my host asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," added his wife, "it will not take long to make a cup of coffee."\r\n\r\n"Not to-day," I replied, "but some other time."\r\n\r\n"All right," the host said; "don\'t forget."\r\n\r\nI was glad when I got out. This abode was the _gamme_ of a poor Sea\r\nLapp, and the poorest kind of dwelling seen among them.\r\n\r\nThe next house, which was at a short distance, belonged to the captain\r\nof one of the boats which had been alongside of our ship. He and his\r\nwife were waiting for me outside and bade me come in. His house was\r\nlong, narrow, and low, and built entirely of flat stones. I entered\r\nthrough a wooden door a room built in the centre of the house. Their\r\nwinter garments hung on poles, there was a pile of firewood, and a heap\r\nof dry seaweed and reindeer moss.\r\n\r\nI followed him to the room on the left. There the family lived. The\r\nfloor of the room was covered with flat slabs; in one corner was a bed\r\non the floor, itself made of young branches of birch, kept together by\r\nlogs. The skins that made the rest of the bed were outside to be aired.\r\nThis room was about ten feet long and about ten feet wide, the whole\r\nwidth of the house, and lighted by a small window with tiny panes of\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the bed in the corner was a small cow. Such a cow! I had\r\nnever seen one so small. In the opposite corner was another one. These\r\ntwo cows were hardly three feet high, and between the two were a calf\r\nand three sheep. "These animals," said my host, "help us to keep our\r\nroom warm and comfortable during the winter months."\r\n\r\nThis was a very strange way of heating a room, I thought to myself.\r\n\r\n"Come and stay with us to-night," added the Lapp. "You will sleep\r\ncomfortably and you will not be cold."\r\n\r\nI accepted.\r\n\r\nThe furniture of the room consisted of some kettles, a coffee pot,\r\ncoffee grinder, a lamp, and a few chests. Everything, strange to say,\r\nwas very clean. The third room contained a few nets, and on the floor\r\nwere a few reindeer skins upon which slept any stranger who chanced to\r\nshare their dwelling. I was a favored guest. I was to sleep in the same\r\nroom with the host, hostess, cows and sheep. I was considered as one of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nI slept splendidly. In the morning I had water to wash my face with.\r\nThat was fine! I gave myself a good rubbing with soap, for I said,\r\n"Paul, after you leave this place it will be quite a while before you\r\nwash your face, except with snow." But I could not as successfully get\r\nrid of the odor of the stable, which clung to my clothes with a\r\npersistence that would have driven every friend I had away from me if I\r\nhad been at home.\r\n\r\nNot far from this _gamme_ was the house of another well-to-do Sea Lapp,\r\none of the rich fellows of the hamlet. His house was long and narrow,\r\none part built of logs, the remainder of layers of turf.\r\n\r\nThe wooden part was the every-day room--parlor, bedroom, kitchen. The\r\nroof was supported by poles and covered with birch bark, over which more\r\nthan a foot of earth had been placed to keep the cold out; the birch\r\nbark was used as shingles and kept the rain from dripping inside. Two\r\nlittle cows, two dwarfish oxen, eight sheep, and two goats completed the\r\nhousehold, and these were housed in the turf compartment.\r\n\r\nFurther on I passed a somewhat long and narrow house built entirely of\r\nturf, which I also visited, and as I came out of it a very strange sight\r\ngreeted me. Several people were returning with their dwarfish carts\r\nloaded with seaweed; each was drawn by a team of two wretched little\r\noxen not bigger than the cows of the place--that is, not more than three\r\nfeet in height. Some were driven by women, others by men or children.\r\n\r\nThese queer-looking small carts were of the same pattern as those used\r\nthousands of years ago. The wheels were of a solid block of wood hewn\r\nout of the trunk of fir trees, which grow on the banks of some of the\r\nfjords, though the land is so far north, owing to the effects of the\r\nGulf Stream. These wheels were of the pattern first made by man, and for\r\nthousands of years there had been no improvement; just as in some parts\r\nof the world the natives to-day still use the dug-out, or canoe made of\r\nthe trunk or bark of a tree--the primitive boat of man. The carts were\r\nloaded with seaweed, fish, or reindeer moss.\r\n\r\nI stayed here several days, and one day I went to see Ole Maja, the\r\nnabob of the place. Ole was an old Sea Lapp, who was considered very\r\nrich among his neighbors. His house was entirely built of logs, and was\r\nmuch admired by the people. The little room had two plain pine-wood\r\nbeds, a cast-iron stove (the only one in the hamlet), a clock and three\r\nwooden chairs. Everything was exceedingly clean. He belonged to the best\r\ntype of Sea Lapps.\r\n\r\nOle owned a horse, which had a special stable built of turf, and his\r\nfour cows, two oxen, and twelve sheep were kept in another building. I\r\nasked what he wanted a horse for in these high latitudes. He answered:\r\n"We use them on the frozen rivers to draw logs." "The hay I gather in\r\nsummer," he added, "is for him. Horses are very particular, they will\r\nnot eat the kind of food we give to our cattle, sheep or goats." I did\r\nnot wonder at this.\r\n\r\nI noticed, as there was no snow on the ground, that all the dwellings of\r\nthe little hamlet had small patches of land round them, which were to be\r\nplanted with potatoes when warm weather came.\r\n\r\nThose who had the best houses wanted me to stay with them, and to avoid\r\nmaking distinctions I agreed to remain with each family one day until I\r\nwent away. They seemed very much pleased.\r\n\r\nI witnessed one day the feeding of the cattle, sheep, and goats. This\r\nwas a sight! They were to be fed on that day with raw fish cut in\r\npieces, instead of boiled heads of dry cod, or boiled lichen. These\r\npieces of fish were put in large wide wooden pails, the animals were\r\ncalled, and they devoured the contents with great avidity. This amazed\r\nme greatly. Just think of cattle feeding on raw fish!\r\n\r\nOne day found me comfortably settled in a _gamme_ which belonged to\r\nMatias Laiti. The chief meal was of reindeer meat and fish,--a boiled\r\nhead of fresh cod. This is considered the sweetest and nicest part of\r\nthe fish. A great wooden bowl of milk was given to me. The milk had a\r\nqueer taste--it had a fishy taste--so had everything else, I thought. I\r\nam sure that if the cannibals that were my friends in Africa had been\r\nhere, and eaten me up, they would have found that I tasted of fish, for\r\nI had been living on fish ever so long.\r\n\r\nI kept visiting one Sea Lapp and his family after another, and had a\r\ngood time--living on fish and reindeer meat, for the Sea Lapps own\r\nreindeer which are kept for their relations or friends further in the\r\ninterior. Sea Lapps intermarry much with river Lapps, and also with\r\nnomadic Lapps. They form really one family.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning they were dressed in their best _vuolpo_ head-dresses\r\nand garments. These were red, blue and white, with red and yellow bands\r\nat the bottom of the skirt. Some had pretty belts, and wore necklaces of\r\nlarge glass beads. The women and men had combed their hair, and it was\r\nnot to be combed again for a week. They all had washed their faces and\r\nhands. One woman wore a pair of blue woollen trousers, fitting tight\r\nfrom the knees to the ankle, had put on a new pair of Lapp shoes, and\r\nwore casque-like head-gear, which was blue like her dress and had red\r\nseams. The boats were ready to be rowed across the fjord to take them to\r\nthe church, where service was held once in three weeks. They were all\r\nLutherans.\r\n\r\nThere were hardly any children in the place. The school was the other\r\nside of the fjord by the church. The children were about to return to\r\ntheir parents, for in summer there is no school. All the\r\nSwedish-Norwegian Lapps know how to read and write.\r\n\r\nOne evening as we were talking round a bright fire, one of the Lapps\r\nsaid to me, "Paulus, you have told us that you intend to travel\r\nsouthward by land. If that is so, there is no time to be lost, for the\r\nsun is getting more powerful every day, and the snow will soon be in an\r\nunfit condition for reindeer to travel on, and the ice over the rivers\r\nand lakes will break; besides you are going to have great difficulty in\r\nprocuring reindeer, for no reindeer can be had at the post stations now.\r\nYou may be detained on the way, and be obliged to wait until snow has\r\nmelted and the rivers become navigable. At this time of the year the\r\nreindeer are very feeble; it is the worst time to travel with them; they\r\nshed their coats and horns and are weak and lean from their winter\r\ndigging. During the day they feel the heat of the sun, and do not go as\r\nfast as during the winter months. So, though we love to have you stay\r\nwith us, if you want to go you had better hasten your departure. Do not\r\nforget to take with you blue or green goggles, for the glare is so\r\nintense, on account of the bright sun, you will surely become snow-blind\r\nif you have none with you. We are going to send for reindeer, and we\r\nwill give you a guide to go with you."\r\n\r\nThe long days come on with remarkable rapidity in this far North. The\r\nsun was below the horizon till the latter part of January, and now on\r\nthe 25th of April in clear weather I could read a newspaper at midnight.\r\nThere were to be no more nights. The Long Night had been driven away\r\nfrom the pole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n COMPARISON OF FINMARKEN WITH ALASKA.--THE TWO LANDS MUCH ALIKE.--WHAT\r\n     MUST BE DONE FOR ALASKA.--COLONIZATION.--IMPORTATION OF\r\n     REINDEER.--PROTECTION OF FISHERIES.--HOUSES OF REFUGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same evening (it has to be called so for the sake of distinction) I\r\nstood out on the brow of the hill, looking at the fjord and Arctic\r\nOcean. Suddenly Alaska came to my mind. I remembered all I had seen on\r\nthe coast of Finmarken, and also all I had encountered and done in "Snow\r\nLand", "The Land of the Long Night," and "The Land of the Winds," and I\r\nsaid to myself, "Why should not Alaska have its fishing towns,\r\nsettlements, and hamlets, like those of Finmarken, and become as\r\nprosperous as the country I have travelled through?" There is a\r\nwonderful similarity between these two countries; they are both exactly\r\nin the same latitudes; they have the same kind of barren coast bathed by\r\na warm stream, and both have fjords.\r\n\r\nAlaska has immense shoals of codfish and herring, besides salmon. Both\r\nhave their long nights, and then long days of Midnight Sun. We must give\r\ninducements to the people of Finmarken to come to Alaska. They will find\r\nin their new country something similar to the one they have left, they\r\nwill enjoy the same life. California and Oregon will provide the people\r\nwith flour and send them delicacies and products of their state, and\r\ntake in return the cod and herring. The southern American countries\r\nwould be a great market for their codfish.\r\n\r\nThen I thought that the only way to make Alaska prosperous eventually,\r\nis to do exactly what the Swedes and Norwegians have done for their\r\ncountry in the far North. The fisheries must be protected, and the laws\r\nregulating them must be enforced. Then, as on the Finmarken coast,\r\ntowns, hamlets, and fishing settlements will rise in the course of time,\r\nand the wealth of the people will come from the fish--their gold from\r\nthe sea. Then we shall have more American-born sailors to man our ships.\r\n\r\nSome of the barren hills of Alaska should be planted with juniper,\r\nbirch, alder, and with pine and fir and other trees growing in the high\r\naltitudes of the mountains of Scandinavia. It will take a good deal of\r\ntime, but the world was not made in one day. The Scandinavian laws\r\nregarding the cutting of trees below a certain size ought to be adopted\r\nfor Alaska.\r\n\r\nThen we must import many reindeer, and establish the same laws in regard\r\nto them and their pasture as the Swedes and Norwegians have done. A\r\ngreat many of these reindeer must be broken, and brought up to eat kept\r\nreindeer moss. Samoides and Laplanders must be induced to come to\r\nAlaska; they know how to take care of the reindeer, they are accustomed\r\nto law and order, and they are absolutely honest.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, they are honest," I said loudly without knowing it; "for\r\nthey knew I had money with me, and I have never been afraid of being\r\nrobbed or murdered. Such thoughts have never entered my head." Then I\r\nthought of the good care these kind people took of me when there was\r\ndanger in travelling.\r\n\r\nWherever there is a little good grazing land, houses and farms of\r\nrefuge, and post stations where reindeer can be procured, must be built\r\nby the government in the interior, so that people can find refuge from\r\nthe terrific storms that blow over Alaska, and I cannot realize how they\r\ncould be fiercer than those I had encountered in Finmarken. With\r\nreindeer and skees, travelling will become easy, and good distances will\r\nbe made in a short time.\r\n\r\nIn summer boat stations must be established along navigable rivers, also\r\na tariff made for distances and for food--so that there be no\r\novercharge--as is done in Sweden, Norway, and Finland.\r\n\r\nLittle hamlets with the church and the school will rise. Doctors must be\r\nsent, and paid a salary by the government; besides a fee must be given\r\nby the patient, who will then not call the doctor for a trifle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n PREPARATIONS TO LEAVE THE ARCTIC COAST.--GREAT DANGER OF ENCOUNTERING\r\n     MELTING SNOW, OR RIVERS MADE DANGEROUS BY THE ICE BREAKING.--REINDEER\r\n     COME.--FAREWELL TO THE SEA LAPPS.--I LEAVE FOR MORE SOUTHERN LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advice the Sea Lapps had given me was not to be neglected, and I at\r\nonce made hasty preparations for my journey southward. There was not one\r\nhour or one minute to be lost. I did not want to be caught in the midst\r\nof vast tracts of half-melted snow, seven, eight, or ten feet deep, with\r\nreindeer unable to travel further; or to drive over rivers and lakes\r\ncovered with treacherous ice, made the more dangerous by being hidden\r\nunder the snow--or, worst of all, to find no reindeer to carry me\r\nonward; or delayed somewhere, waiting for the snow to melt and the land\r\nto become dry and the rivers navigable, for during the time of thaw the\r\ncountry is full of bogs and swamps, and the rivers become in many places\r\nbut roaring torrents, their waters dashing against huge boulders strewn\r\nin their beds, or breaking over them in rapids and pouring cataracts.\r\n\r\nMy little sleigh, my skees, my bags, and winter outfits were landed, and\r\nwere before me. I left off my sou\'wester and oilskin garments and\r\nsea-boots, and I said to them: "We have had rough weather together on\r\nthis stormy Arctic sea. Henceforth I do not need you any more; I hope\r\nyou will keep the Sea Lapp to whom I give you as dry as you did me."\r\n\r\nThen I donned my Lapp costume once more. Now the fur shoes of winter\r\nwere unsuitable to travel with, for being porous they are only good to\r\nget over dry and crisp snow with. I had to wear henceforth the shoes or\r\nboots that are without fur and the leather of which is prepared in such\r\na manner as to be impermeable to water or damp snow. I had provided\r\nmyself with two pairs of these, while at Haparanda on my way to "The\r\nLand of the Long Night," for my return journey,--a short pair, of the\r\nshape of the winter shoes, and a pair of boots coming as high as my\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nOne of the Lapps smeared them with a preparation of tar and fat that he\r\nused for his own shoes. When they were ready he said: "Now you are all\r\nright, no dampness or water will penetrate them," and he gave me some of\r\nthe stuff to use on my journey, saying, "Rub your shoes every two days\r\nwith it." I thanked him. Then I put on a new pair of woollen socks. I\r\nsurrounded my feet with the Lapp grass, and wore my short boots.\r\n\r\nWhile turning over in my mind the mishaps that might come to me on this\r\nsouthward journey, I fancied the same friendly voices I had heard before\r\nfrom across the Atlantic called to me: "Hurry on, Friend Paul! Hurry on!\r\nfor there is danger in delay; and when your journey is finished come\r\nback to us at once."\r\n\r\n"I will hurry on," I replied aloud. "Do not be afraid. I will return at\r\nonce to our dear United States." After this I was more impatient to\r\nleave than before. I waited anxiously for the reindeer to arrive.\r\n\r\nHenceforth I shall wear only one fur garment, instead of two as I did\r\nduring my journey northward, for the weather is getting warmer every\r\nday. After I was dressed completely I looked affectionately at my little\r\nsleigh, for I remembered the many hundreds of miles we had travelled\r\ntogether, what fun I had had, and how hard it was at first to learn to\r\ndrive reindeer and to keep inside the sleigh, and all the sudden\r\nupsettings I had.\r\n\r\nThen I looked at my skees, and said: "Dear skees, we are again to tramp\r\nover the snow together. I wish I could leap over chasms with you, as the\r\nLapps do. I cannot do that; but we will walk on the snow, and go down\r\nhill riding a stick. This will be great fun for me anyhow."\r\n\r\nThen I turned to the bags, and I said: "Dear bags, I have often thought\r\nof you and how comfortable I was with you." I remembered how cosy I was\r\nwhen I slept in them on the snow. I did not mind how hard the wind blew;\r\nthe harder it blew the more comfortable I felt inside of them. Near by\r\nthem was the big brown bearskin, which was safely fastened over me in\r\nthe sleigh. I said: "Dear bearskin, I think a great deal of you also,\r\nfor you have been my friend and have kept my legs so warm when I was\r\ndriving."\r\n\r\nThe next morning to my great joy the reindeer came,--one for me, one for\r\nmy guide, and a spare one; but how differently they looked compared with\r\nthose I had in the winter. They were thin, and were changing their\r\ncoats. I did not wonder that the poor reindeer did not look frisky--they\r\nhad had to work so hard for their living, digging the snow to reach the\r\nmoss during the whole of the winter.\r\n\r\nI looked at the guide the kind Sea Lapps had provided for me. He was the\r\nman who had come with the reindeer. His name was Mikel. He was a nomadic\r\nLapp, but had come to visit his sister, who had married a Sea Lapp. He\r\nwas about four feet eight inches in height, well built, broad\r\nshouldered, nimble as a deer, about forty years old, with a face made by\r\nthe wind as red as a ripe tomato. He lived and pastured his herd of\r\nreindeer south of Karesuando.\r\n\r\nAs we were introduced to each other we shook hands, and I said, "Mikel,\r\nwe are going to be friends."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied, "we are to be friends."\r\n\r\nThen all the Sea Lapps that were round us shouted with one voice:\r\n"Paulus, we are all your friends! Mikel will take good care of you."\r\n\r\n"I will," said Mikel. "I will take good care of Paulus." "Thank you,\r\nMikel," I replied. From that moment Mikel and I became fast friends.\r\n\r\nAn hour after the arrival of the reindeer and after a hearty meal of\r\ncodfish and black bread we were ready to start.\r\n\r\nBefore seating myself in the sleigh, I turned my face towards the North\r\nPole and looked at the Arctic Ocean beyond the fjord, and shouted:\r\n"Farewell to thee! farewell, tempestuous Arctic Sea! farewell to thy\r\ngales! farewell to thy snow and sleet storms. But I am glad I have been\r\nthrough it all, for I have learned something I did not know before. I\r\nhave gained knowledge about the people and \'The Land of the Long\r\nNight.\'"\r\n\r\nOne of the Sea Lapps held my reindeer, and after I was seated another\r\ndrew my bearskin round me, and made it secure with the cord belonging to\r\nmy sleigh.\r\n\r\nWhen Mikel saw that I was ready he jumped into his sleigh and we\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, good-bye, Paulus!" shouted all the Lapps.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, good-bye, dear Sea Lapps!"--I shouted back to them, and the\r\nlast words I heard were: "Lucky journey, Paulus, come to see us again,\r\ncome to see us again."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n WE ENTER A BIRCH FOREST.--THE REINDEER ARE SOON FAGGED.--SLEEP ON THE\r\n     SNOW.--THE RAYS OF THE SUN MELT THROUGH THE SNOW.--GREAT DIFFICULTY\r\n     IN TRAVELLING.--MEET HERDS OF REINDEER.--REINDEER BULLS FIGHT EACH\r\n     OTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe entered the birch forest soon after our departure. We had great\r\ndifficulty in driving among the trees. I was glad our reindeer were not\r\nas frisky as in the earlier part of the winter. I could hardly follow\r\nthe track of Mikel, and sometimes I could not do so at all. I drove\r\nsometimes against one tree and then against another, then the boughs of\r\nthe birch would strike against my face. I had not been five minutes\r\namong the birches when I was upset.\r\n\r\nAt last, losing patience, I shouted to Mikel, "When are we to get out of\r\nthese birch trees into the open country?" He replied: "We shall reach\r\nthe river soon."\r\n\r\nThe snow was not more than three or four or five inches deep at first,\r\nbut grew gradually deeper as we moved further south. Along the coast of\r\nFinmarken the heat of the Gulf Stream prevents it from lying deep on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon we reached the Tana river, at a place called Polmak, and\r\nsped on over its snow-covered ice.\r\n\r\nSeven or eight miles was all that our reindeer could do in an hour, and\r\nduring the day we had to stop several times to give them rest.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o\'clock we stopped for the night. We spread our bags upon\r\nthe snow, but we got into one only, for two would have been too warm at\r\nthis time of the year; and as Mikel and I were ready to disappear in\r\nthem, I said "Good-night, Mikel," and he replied "Good-night, Paulus."\r\n\r\nIt snowed during the night, and when we awoke in the morning our bags\r\nwere covered with it. I did not wonder when I saw this that I had felt\r\nso warm during the night.\r\n\r\nI was the first to be up. I shook Mikel\'s bag and shouted to him, "Get\r\nup, Mikel," and as his head peeped out of his bag, I said\r\n"Good-morning," and he cried "Good-morning, Paulus." Then we took our\r\nbreakfast. The reindeer, while we were asleep, had dug through the snow\r\nto the lichen and fed, and now were quietly resting.\r\n\r\nWe were soon on the way. As the sun rose higher and higher and its rays\r\ngrew more powerful, the snow became soft, and the travelling so hard for\r\nour reindeer that we had to stop; the thermometer marked 44 degrees in\r\nthe shade and 80 degrees in the sun. There were sometimes twenty or\r\nthirty degrees\' difference of temperature during the twenty-four hours,\r\nbut the change came so slowly, hour after hour, that I did not notice\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo we had to stop travelling, and while the reindeer rested we took to\r\nour skees and went in search of game, but no foxes or wolves were to be\r\nseen. Towards four o\'clock in the afternoon the snow began to freeze\r\nagain, and we again took up our journey. Now the nights have to be\r\nturned into days, for we can only travel during the time when the sun is\r\nnot shining or has not great power.\r\n\r\nWe travelled without interruption the following day, as the sky was\r\ncloudy and the snow was hard. Towards midnight Mikel said: "Our reindeer\r\nare tired, we must rest; but we will not sleep more than three or four\r\nhours, for we must reach a station where we can procure fresh reindeer."\r\n\r\nWe unharnessed our reindeer, and tied them with long ropes. When this\r\nwas done we got into our bags and soon were fast asleep.\r\n\r\nAt about three o\'clock Mikel awoke me, saying, "Paulus, it is about time\r\nto go."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mikel," I replied, "let me sleep one hour more, for I need more\r\nsleep. I want another snooze."\r\n\r\n"There is no time to be lost," he replied; "you will have a snooze later\r\nin the day."\r\n\r\nSo I rubbed my eyes to get fully awake, and washed my face with snow,\r\nand felt ready for another start.\r\n\r\nThat morning the sky was very clear, and after a while the sun shone\r\nbrightly and the glare on the snow was so great that it would have been\r\nimpossible to travel without green or blue goggles. I had two pairs\r\nwith me, in case I should lose or break one by some accident.\r\n\r\nOn account of the strength of the sun\'s rays, which melted the snow, we\r\nhad to stop our travelling by eleven o\'clock. Our reindeer were\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nI took my short pair of skees, covered with sealskin, and went ptarmigan\r\nhunting. I killed four. The birds had already dropped many of their\r\nwhite feathers, which had been replaced by gray ones. They were getting\r\ntheir summer coats, and would soon be entirely gray.\r\n\r\nAfter killing these I went further, and saw something in the distance\r\nmoving on the snow. Soon I discovered it was a fox of a peculiar color\r\nwhich I had not seen before. I lay flat on the snow, as the animal was\r\ncoming in my direction. He was evidently hungry, and was hunting\r\nptarmigans himself. When he came within shooting distance I fired and\r\nkilled him. He was a white fox, but much of his snowy-white fur had\r\ndropped, and was replaced by bluish. I wondered if the change took place\r\nfor his own protection and advantage. When white he could not be seen so\r\neasily by the creatures upon which he preyed, and when bluish he could\r\nnot be so easily seen as if he had remained white.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned Mikel was stretched on his back on the snow with his\r\narms spread out, and was snoring like a good fellow. Oh, what a noise he\r\nmade! He had succeeded in frightening our reindeer, which had moved\r\naway as far as the rope would allow them. I did not wonder that they did\r\nnot like Mikel\'s snoring.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at Mikel I stretched myself on the snow, but quite a\r\ndistance from him, not to be disturbed by his snoring. Now we did not\r\nrequire any masks on our faces, and during the day slept without being\r\nobliged to get into our bags.\r\n\r\nSoon I fell asleep, and dreamed that I was attacked by a big pack of\r\nwolves--I jumped up and looked round, but there were no wolves. I had\r\nhad the nightmare from sleeping on my back. Mikel was still snoring, and\r\nI looked at him and thought I would let him snore a little more.\r\n\r\nTowards four o\'clock in the afternoon, as it was beginning to freeze\r\nagain and the snow was fit for travelling, I awoke him. Soon after we\r\nstarted, and we had not driven an hour when we saw a tent in the\r\ndistance and made for it. The Lapp family who owned it received us with\r\ngreat hospitality. Coffee was made and we were invited to spend the\r\nnight. I looked forward with great pleasure to the prospect of a good\r\nwarm meal of reindeer meat and good reindeer broth.\r\n\r\nThese people were great friends of Mikel, and they agreed to give us\r\nsome of their reindeer that were not as fagged out as ours. I was\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\nHow I enjoyed the warm reindeer meat and the reindeer broth! It was\r\nfine! I was so hungry. After this meal we were presented with a lot of\r\ncooked reindeer meat for our journey, and one of the Lapps was to go\r\nwith us, for he wanted to see some of his friends further south.\r\n\r\nTowards three o\'clock in the morning we started. We saw many herds of\r\nreindeer--they were moving westward towards the mountains that stretched\r\nto the Arctic Sea. It was a grand sight. I saw more than thirty thousand\r\nreindeer that day, in herds from one thousand to two or three thousand.\r\nThe Lapps on their skees, with their dogs, urged the animals onward, and\r\nthe dogs brought those which were trying to go astray, or lagged behind,\r\ninto the ranks.\r\n\r\nMany of the reindeer had already dropped their horns, and the calving\r\nseason had begun. How pretty were the tiny baby reindeer; they were put\r\non special sleighs and driven in them, their mothers following, uttering\r\na queer kind of grunt.\r\n\r\nThe baggage of the family and tents went with them, led by women who\r\ncarried their young children in their cradles slung on their backs.\r\n\r\nLate that day I saw a splendid sight, two herds were approaching each\r\nother in opposite directions. The bulls of each herd advanced to charge\r\nthe others with great fury and began a terrible fight, advancing and\r\nretreating, then charging again, butting furiously. The horns of two\r\ncombatants sometimes became entangled, and it took a long time for them\r\nto disengage themselves. Mikel said: "Sometimes they cannot be separated\r\nand have to be killed." In the mean time, the Lapps and dogs went after\r\nthem, and with great trouble they were parted and made to go to their\r\nrespective herds. I noticed, as I went further south, that the twilight\r\nwas not so bright as it was in the North--for in that northern land, the\r\ndaylight comes from the direction of the pole.\r\n\r\nThe darkest part of the day or night was somewhat after eleven o\'clock\r\nP.M., but even then I could read, and as we travelled only Jupiter and\r\nVenus looked at us--no other stars were visible, and towards half-past\r\none these two disappeared, for daylight was so strong; and when the\r\nweather was clear after that time only the pale blue sky of the North\r\nand its fleecy white clouds were to be seen above our heads. How\r\nbeautiful it was!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n VARIABLE WEATHER.--SNOWY DAYS.--AN UNINHABITED HOUSE OF REFUGE.--ANIMALS\r\n     CHANGING THE COLOR OF THEIR FUR.--MIKEL TELLS ME ABOUT A\r\n     BEAR.--KILLING THE BEAR.--HURRYING ON OVER SOFT SNOW AND FROZEN\r\n     RIVERS.--THE ICE BEGINS TO BREAK.--PASS THE ARCTIC CIRCLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnward we went, sleeping one day in the tent of a nomadic Lapp, another\r\nday in our bags, at other times in the _gamme_ of a river Lapp. The\r\nweather was very changeable; one day it was clear, the next day the sky\r\nwas gray. Snowy days were not uncommon.\r\n\r\nMidway between Nordkyn and Haparanda the snow was of great depth. Only\r\nthe tops of the birch trees could be seen, and strange to say the\r\nbranches were in bloom, for the trees felt the heat of the sun, and the\r\nsnow had prevented the freezing of the ground to a great depth. The snow\r\nmust have been eight or ten feet deep in some regions.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the summit of the plateau, the watershed that divided\r\nthe rivers falling into the Arctic Sea and the Baltic, the weather was\r\nvery stormy. Though it was the 13th of May, we met a furious snowstorm.\r\nThis was dangerous for us, and Mikel attached my sleigh to his by a long\r\nrope, so that we might not become separated. The snowstorm seemed,\r\nhowever, to give new strength to the reindeer, and they went faster than\r\nusual, and besides the cold weather we had had the two previous\r\ndays--the thermometer marking 15 to 18 degrees of frost--had evidently\r\ninvigorated them. For a while there was a lull in the storm, and we were\r\nglad when we came to a house of refuge.\r\n\r\nThe house was small and uninhabited, but clean inside. Some food was\r\nhanging from the ceiling, belonging to some Lapp or some wanderer like\r\nourselves, who had left it to have it on his return journey. The food\r\nwas sacred and safe. No one would have dared to touch it, no matter how\r\nhungry he was, for it did not belong to him, and the one who had left it\r\nperhaps depended upon it to sustain his life on his return. We peeped\r\ninto the parcel--there was some hard bread, reindeer cheese, and a\r\nsmoked reindeer tongue, a coffee kettle and some coffee, and a few small\r\npieces of wood tied together, to make a fire to cook the coffee with.\r\nThis was one of those houses of refuge used only for shelter, without\r\npeople to keep them, built especially by the government for that\r\npurpose, in case of sudden storm.\r\n\r\nAfter a while I went out for a walk on my skees, to stretch my legs, for\r\nI had been more than ten hours seated in my sleigh. I took my gun with\r\nme. Soon I spied some hares, and succeeded in killing two. These were\r\nalso changing their fur coats; much of their fur was gray, and mixed\r\nwith white; the hares were to be gray during the summer months. As white\r\nwas their protection in winter against big white owls, foxes, and other\r\nanimals, so their gray color would protect them against their enemies in\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n"Strange indeed is nature," I said to myself. "In some cases the animals\r\nchange their fur so that they can approach their prey without being\r\nseen; in other cases nature changes their fur to protect them against\r\ntheir enemies."\r\n\r\nWhen I returned I saw that Mikel had prepared our supper. He had fetched\r\nsome firewood he had in his sleigh, and a bright fire was burning under\r\nour coffee kettle. Reindeer meat, tongue, and reindeer cheese had been\r\nput on a wooden dish, and two tin cups were ready for the coffee to be\r\npoured into them. We seated ourselves cross-legged on the floor, and\r\nbegan our meal. What a nice cup of coffee we had! How deliciously it\r\ntasted! How good was our coarse hard black bread and our reindeer\r\ncheese, and smoked reindeer tongue!\r\n\r\nAfter we had drunk our coffee and eaten our supper I noticed that Mikel\r\nwas very silent and thoughtful. I wondered if he was thinking of dangers\r\nahead--of the sudden stopping of our journey,--and just as I was on the\r\npoint of asking him why he was so thoughtful he broke the silence\r\nhimself and said: "Paulus, I know where there is a big brown bear--a\r\nreal big fellow. The Bear\'s Night is not over with him yet, and he must\r\nbe still sleeping under the snow at the place where I saw him last\r\nautumn getting ready to go into his winter quarters."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say so, Mikel!" I exclaimed. "Is the bear sleeping near where\r\nwe are?"\r\n\r\n"Not so very near," he replied with a twinkle in his eye. "A few hours\r\nwill bring us to his place."\r\n\r\nHe saw by my looks that I was ready to go after the bear. It was just\r\nwhat he wished. So he continued: "Paulus, shall we go and kill the bear,\r\nbefore he awakes and goes into the mountains and forests to commit his\r\ndepredations,--for after his long fast he will be very hungry--and are\r\nyou willing to lose two or three days and run the risk of having our\r\njourney come to an end?"\r\n\r\nWhen I heard this, I forgot all about the ice cracking over the streams\r\nand lakes, about the snow melting and preventing people from travelling.\r\n"Yes, Mikel," I replied, "let us go after the bear. Afterwards we will\r\ntravel as fast as we can and take very little sleep; perhaps we shall\r\nhave luck and the weather may be colder than usual for a while."\r\n\r\n"All right," replied Mikel; "we will go after the bear."\r\n\r\n"Mikel," said I "before we stretch ourselves on the floor and go to\r\nsleep, tell me how you know that the bear is at the spot you suppose and\r\nthat he is spending his winter night there."\r\n\r\nMikel took a big pinch of snuff and replied: "Paulus, I think I am the\r\nonly one, that knows where this bear is sleeping, for I have kept it a\r\nsecret. I hope no other person knows where he is, for I want his skin.\r\nBesides I shall get a premium in money if we kill him."\r\n\r\nThen he added: "One day last fall as I was hunting for ptarmigans I saw\r\nin the distance a huge brown bear walking about and getting ready for\r\nhis winter quarters. I knew that he was seeking his winter lodgings,\r\nbecause he was going round and round a big cluster of pines before\r\nentering it. I watched! After a a while he disappeared among the pines\r\nand I saw no more of him. I knew that if he were not disturbed or\r\nfrightened away he would stay there. The bear assuredly had seen the\r\nplace during the summer and thought it was a good one for his long\r\nsleep. This bear knew that a big snowstorm was coming, and he was not\r\nmistaken, for that night snow fell very heavily and the storm lasted two\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n"The Bear\'s Night will soon be over in this region," Mikel continued,\r\n"and at any moment this bear may awaken, break through the snow that is\r\nover him, and go away. Perhaps he is already gone. At this time of the\r\nyear the slightest noise will arouse a bear, for by this time he has\r\nceased to sleep soundly."\r\n\r\nThen he added: "We have had very little sleep since we left the coast,\r\nPaulus; we need a good rest before we go after the bear."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I, "my eyes ache for want of a good long sleep."\r\n\r\nWe stretched ourselves on the earth floor, and soon after I heard the\r\nsnoring of Mikel. He was an inveterate snorer,--I thought the champion\r\nsnorer of all those I ever had met.\r\n\r\nI could not go to sleep, though I was so tired. I turned first on one\r\nside, then on the other, then lay on my back. I was much excited, for I\r\nthought of the big brown bear and of the hunt that was before us. At\r\nlast I fell asleep. Suddenly I was awakened by a shaking of Mikel, and\r\nas I opened my eyes he said, "Paulus, what is the matter? You have been\r\nshouting."\r\n\r\nI was in a profuse perspiration. I had again had nightmare from lying on\r\nmy back. I was fighting with a big bear which had seized me, and we were\r\nwrestling and I was getting the worst of it, and when ready to fall down\r\nin his grasp I had given a big scream.\r\n\r\nAfter our breakfast that morning, Mikel said: "We must go and tell some\r\nof the folks who live in a little hamlet not far from here to come with\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"What do you call not far from here?" I asked.\r\n\r\nI had begun to know what "not far" meant with the Lapps. "Two hours\'\r\ntravel, or about fifteen miles," he replied. "I have friends there."\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the little house of refuge Mikel swept the floor, and\r\nmade it as clean as we had found it--for it is the custom of the people\r\nto do this before they leave.\r\n\r\nWe then started eastward, and after two hours\' travelling we came to a\r\nfew farms and entered a house. Mikel told the people about the bear. The\r\nnews soon spread and there was much excitement. During the day\r\npreparations were made for the hunt.\r\n\r\nThe next morning men gathered, taking their guns and big long sticks,\r\nwith pikes at the ends to prod the bear with; and all the dogs of the\r\nplace followed us. Many men started on their skees, others in their\r\nsleighs. According to Mikel the bear was about thirty miles away.\r\n\r\nI was full of enthusiasm, and longed to come face to face with the big\r\nbrown bear of northern Europe.\r\n\r\nAbout three hours after, we stopped. All the people took counsel\r\ntogether and spoke in low voices. Then Mikel, pointing out to me a big\r\ncluster of trees, said, "Paulus, the bear is there."\r\n\r\nSlowly we made for the spot, and then entered the grove, and went in\r\ndifferent directions seeking for the bear\'s winter quarters. Soon after\r\nwe saw a heap of snow, or little hillock, that covered evidently some\r\nboulders piled on the top of each other or a cluster of fallen broken\r\npine trees.\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other and pointed towards the spot--we knew that the\r\nbear was under the snow there. Mikel whispered to me, "The bear sleeps\r\nunder that hillock of snow."\r\n\r\nWe surrounded the place, then on a sudden we shouted and made a terrific\r\nnoise. Two or three of the men fired their guns, the dogs barked\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "He sat on his haunches and looked at us, uttering a\r\ntremendous growl."]\r\n\r\nThen we saw the centre of the heap or hillock of snow tremble, as if\r\nsome live creature were moving slowly under it. Then the snow moved a\r\nlittle quicker. There was no mistake, the bear was awakened, had\r\nmoved, and was on the point of rising; he was listening, and getting\r\nready to come out. The noise had frightened him. The snow trembled more\r\nand more and rose higher and higher. Suddenly there was a great\r\nupheaval, and great cracks appeared in the crusted snow. Then we saw\r\npeeping out the head and back of a huge brown bear, then two legs, and\r\nfinally the whole animal.\r\n\r\nHe looked round him with amazement. He seemed to be dazed at the strange\r\nand sudden sight before him. He sat on his haunches and looked at us,\r\nuttering a tremendous growl. We could not tell whether he meant to fight\r\nor to run. The dogs barked angrily around the huge beast, but did not\r\ndare to approach near enough to attack him. In the meantime we had all\r\ndrawn together so that we could fire without danger of hitting any of\r\nour party. The bear was getting ugly, gave a series of fierce growls,\r\nand rose on his hind legs. At this moment Mikel and I fired. A grunt of\r\npain showed that the animal was hit. He ran a few steps towards us and\r\nas we got ready to fire again the big beast fell, his blood reddening\r\nthe snow.\r\n\r\nWe gathered round and looked at him. He was a huge beast, but very thin\r\nfrom his long fast, for he had been six months or more without food.\r\n\r\nAfter the killing of the bear there was no time to be lost, for we had\r\ndeviated from our course and had gone eastward into Finland. So now we\r\nhad to go westward, and after two days\' travelling we came to the river\r\nMuonio, to a Finnish hamlet called Kuttainen, not far from Karesuando.\r\n\r\nNow travelling became really dangerous. The frozen river was full of\r\ntreacherous cracks, and others were appearing all the time. Once in a\r\nwhile we came to small open spaces, where we could see the swift water\r\nof the stream rushing with great rapidity; this made me shudder. In some\r\nplaces there were large pools of water.\r\n\r\nIt was getting really warm. Some days my "pesh" was comfortable, at\r\nother times it was much too warm, the thermometer reaching 48 to 50\r\ndegrees in the shade and 86 to 88 degrees in the sun. The dripping from\r\nthe melted snow came into the river from the hills, and had succeeded in\r\nmany places in melting the ice on the banks. This travelling was no\r\njoke. I followed Mikel, and watched him constantly, fearing that his\r\nreindeer and sleigh would disappear under the ice. Travelling appeared\r\nto become more and more perilous as we followed the Muonio southward. At\r\ntimes I could hear the angry water under the ice striking against\r\nboulders, and this became quite common.\r\n\r\nAt last I shouted to Mikel, "Let us travel on the land, for surely if we\r\ndo not we shall fall through the ice and be engulfed."\r\n\r\n"We cannot," he shouted back, "the snow is too soft. Our reindeer could\r\nnot pull our sleighs. We can get along much better on the river, though\r\nthe ice is very bad. Trust in me, Paulus. I have made this journey over\r\nthe Muonio River many times before, but you must follow me very closely,\r\nfor sometimes I shall have to pass near rotten ice or open spots."\r\n\r\n"I will follow you carefully, dear Mikel. Go on! Go on!" I said.\r\n\r\nSo I followed Mikel closely, as he had bade me, but what thumps our\r\nsleighs would sometimes get on the now uneven ice of the river!\r\nFortunately they were very strongly built.\r\n\r\nWe slept at a place called Songamuodka. In the morning it snowed, but\r\nthe flakes were big and soft and melted as they fell on the old snow. I\r\nmet no more herds of reindeer, but since I had left on my journey\r\nsouthward I had seen between sixty-five and seventy thousand of them.\r\n\r\nTwo days after I saw the church spire of Pajala, rested there, and on\r\nthe 24th of May, as I was travelling on the Torne River, I passed once\r\nmore the Arctic Circle. It was raining. I was told that it was the first\r\nrain that had fallen for over seven months.\r\n\r\nHere I said good-bye to the good Mikel and thanked him cordially for the\r\ncare he had taken of me.\r\n\r\nI had now left the kingdom of the "Long Night," and the "Long Day" was\r\nto rule over the land through which we have travelled together.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear Young Folks, Friend Paul has come back, as you bade him,\r\nand I hope you have enjoyed our travelling together in "The Land of the\r\nLong Night." Good-bye. Do not forget your Friend Paul, who loves you\r\ndearly, for once he was one of the Young Folks himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Paul Du Chaillu\'s Great Work\r\n\r\n THE VIKING AGE\r\n\r\n THE EARLY HISTORY, MANNERS, &\r\n CUSTOMS OF THE ANCESTORS OF\r\n THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING NATIONS\r\n\r\n WITH 1400 ILLUSTRATIONS AND MAP\r\n 2 vols., 8vo, $7.50\r\n\r\n CHARLES SCRIBNER\'S SONS, Publishers\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNew York Tribune.\r\n\r\n"These luxuriously printed and profusely illustrated volumes embody the\r\nfullest account of our Norse ancestors extant.

Beyond all living\r\nwriters this traveller in and explorer of many countries has collected\r\nthe documents and discovered the secrets of the Norselands."\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York Times.\r\n\r\n"The reader who has begun with a blank mind closes the volume with a\r\ntolerably clear impression of a very energetic, powerful, and wealthy\r\nyoung Viking, capable of strong affections and disaffections, foremost\r\nin games and fights requiring physical force, and with a vast number of\r\nhabits and customs. It is a history that interests through its\r\nsimplicity."\r\n\r\n\r\nBoston Transcript.\r\n\r\n"For the splendor of the materials and the range and variety of the\r\ninformation imparted concerning the misty dawn of our Northern\r\ncivilization, its religious ideas, its moral conceptions, and its social\r\nconditions, \'Ivar\' will have high esteem among the growing number of\r\nstudents turning to the Northern folk-lore and chronicles for the true\r\nclassic period of our modern races."\r\n\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia Public Ledger.\r\n\r\n"He has rendered a double service, for not only does he instruct the\r\nreader in a most graphic and vivid manner, but he also develops a story\r\nof adventure and daring which will be followed with breathless\r\ninterest."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n CHARLES SCRIBNER\'S SONS, Publishers\r\n 153-157 Fifth Avenue, New York\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Note\r\n\r\nMinor spelling and typographical errors have been corrected without\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Land of the Long Night, by Paul du Chaillu\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LAND OF THE LONG NIGHT ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 22727-8.txt or 22727-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/7/2/22727/\r\n\r\nProduced by Peter Vachuska, Chuck Greif, Stephen Blundell\r\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\r\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
