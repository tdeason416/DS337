Pussy came walking along the garden-path. Harry watched her, and saw\r\nthat she did not like the damp ground.\r\n\r\n2. She jumped over the pools, and then began to run, shaking her paws\r\nas she got to the house.\r\n\r\n3. \'Now, a dog does not mind wet feet,\' Harry thought; \'he will go into\r\nthe water, but Pussy will never go into the water.\r\n\r\n4. \'She does not even use water to wash herself. Come here, Pussy! You\r\ndon\'t like to wet your nice fur, do you?\'\r\n\r\n5. As Harry was always kind to pussy, she let him pick her up and carry\r\nher into the house.\r\n\r\n6. He sat down on the rug with her, and stroked her glossy back. One of\r\nher fore-paws rested on his hand, and he began to look at it.\r\n\r\n7. \'Here are five toes,\' he said, \'but what funny toes they are!\' He\r\ngently turned the paw over, and saw the sharp nails drawn in under the\r\nfur.\r\n\r\n8. The cat knew that he would not hurt her, so she kept her claws in,\r\nand let him feel them on the outside.\r\n\r\n9. He found under the paw a soft smooth pad. \'Now I know how it is that\r\nshe can walk so softly!\' he said. \'This must help her to walk in that\r\nway.\'\r\n\r\n10. Here pussy gave a great yawn, and stretched out both her paws, claws\r\nand all. Harry saw the sharp nails like hooks, and watched them go back\r\ninto their sheaths. Then she curled herself up on his lap.\r\n\r\n11. He took hold of one of her hind-feet, and found only four toes upon\r\nit. \'I wonder if this is a mistake,\' he said, \'or if the other one is\r\nthe same.\' Yes, it was just the same: there were four toes, with a claw\r\nat the end of each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cat\'s Paw.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAT\r\n\r\nPART 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n    knives\r\n    bot\xc2\xb4-tom\r\n    should\r\n    tear\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    poured\r\n    clean\r\n    sauc\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    tongue\r\n    touch\r\n    rough\r\n    kit\xc2\xb4-chen\r\n    cous\xc2\xb4-ins\r\n    coun\xc2\xb4-tries\r\n    peo\xc2\xb4-ple\r\n    thought\r\n    be-lieve\xc2\xb4\r\n\r\n1. \'What long sharp teeth she has got!\' cried Harry, as pussy sat up\r\nand opened her mouth. \'They look like knives. There are two at the top,\r\nand two at the bottom!\r\n\r\n2. \'I should not like my finger to be in the way when you shut your\r\nmouth. Your teeth must be for tearing and cutting: I am sure you do not\r\nchew your food as I have to do.\r\n\r\n3. \'And what a way you have of drinking!\r\n\r\n\'Here, pussy, would you like some milk?\' said Harry, and getting up, he\r\npoured a little milk into a clean saucer.\r\n\r\n4. The cat ran to it, and Harry went down on the floor close by to watch\r\nher drinking it.\r\n\r\n5. He saw that pussy\'s tongue was not smooth like his own, but had tiny\r\npoints all over it. It came into his mind that she had once licked his\r\nface, and her tongue had a \'scrapy\' feeling.\r\n\r\n6. \'Do it again, pussy, dear,\' he said, but she went on lapping up the\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n\'May I touch your tongue, then, with one of my fingers?\'\r\n\r\n7. But pussy did not like this. Then Harry took a drop or two of the\r\nmilk into the palm of his hand. And when the cat had taken all she had\r\nin the saucer, she came and licked up the milk in his hand.\r\n\r\n8. She went on licking even when all was gone, and Harry was able in\r\nthis way to feel how rough her tongue was.\r\n\r\n9. Just then his mother came into the kitchen, and Harry told her what\r\nhe had been doing.\r\n\r\nShe asked:\r\n\r\n\'Have you looked at pussy\'s eyes?\'\r\n\r\n10. \'They are funny eyes,\' he said; \'they are green, but there is not\r\nmuch of them to be seen.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not just now,\' said his mother, \'but she can open them wide when she\r\nlikes. Then she can see even in the dark.\'\r\n\r\n11. \'In the dark, mother? Well, she is not a bit like me!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, she is not like you. But she has plenty of cousins. Her cousins are\r\nthe big lions and tigers, that live in hot countries, and eat sheep and\r\nhorses, and even people when they can get them.\'\r\n\r\n12. Harry thought a little, and then said: \'If I were as small as pussy\r\nis now, and if pussy were as big as I am now, I believe she would eat\r\nme!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOG.\r\n\r\n\r\n    fol\xc2\xb4-lowed\r\n    moth\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    hun\xc2\xb4-gry\r\n    lone\xc2\xb4-ly\r\n    win\xc2\xb4-dow\r\n    noise\r\n    la\xc2\xb4-zy\r\n    be-cause\xc2\xb4\r\n    watched\r\n    friend\r\n    bur\xc2\xb4-ied\r\n    e-nough\xc2\xb4\r\n    Ber\xc2\xb4-nard\r\n    shep\xc2\xb4-herd\r\n    wrong\r\n    talk\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n\r\n1. A poor lost dog followed Harry and his little sister home from\r\nschool, and tried to come into the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n2. They shut the door; but, when they opened it again, the dog was still\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n3. He looked so sad that they begged their mother to give him some food.\r\nThen they said: \'We can\'t turn him out again to be hungry and lonely!\r\nLet us keep him till some one comes for him.\' And very soon all three\r\nwere happy at play in the garden.\r\n\r\n4. The cat sat up on a window-sill, and looked at them. She did not seem\r\nto like the fun. What a noise they all made!\r\n\r\n5. \'How much nicer he is to play with than pussy!\' said Dora. \'He is not\r\nnearly so lazy as pussy.\r\n\r\n6. \'Look, he is wagging his tail with joy! Now, if pussy wags her tail,\r\nit means that she is cross. But I think I like her round face better\r\nthan his sharp one.\'\r\n\r\n7. \'I don\'t,\' said Harry. \'See how bright he is, and how he looks as if\r\nhe would like to do something for us!\'\r\n\r\n8. \'That is because we have been kind to him. Hi, good dog!\' and Dora\r\nthrew her ball to the very end of the garden, and watched her new friend\r\nrun after it.\r\n\r\n9. \'Do you think, Harry,\' she asked, \'that he would save us if we were\r\nburied in the snow?\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St Bernard Dog.]\r\n\r\n\'No, he is not a dog of that kind, and is not big enough. The big St\r\nBernard dogs save people when they are lost in the snow.\r\n\r\n10. \'But all dogs are good for something. Look at the shepherd\'s dog.\'\r\n\r\n\'What can he do?\'\r\n\r\n11. \'Oh, he is a wise fellow! He knows just where his master means the\r\nsheep to go, and, if they go the wrong way, he turns them back, and\r\nnever hurts one of them. Why, the shepherd does nothing but walk on,\r\ntelling the dog now and again what to do.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Sheep Dog.]\r\n\r\n12. Here a dog barked on the road outside, and the dog in the garden\r\npricked up his ears and barked too.\r\n\r\n\'They are talking to each other,\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERCUPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    chil\xc2\xb4-dren\r\n    flow\xc2\xb4-ers\r\n    dai\xc2\xb4-sy\r\n    chains\r\n    hun\xc2\xb4-gry\r\n    bas\xc2\xb4-ket\r\n    ought\r\n    but\xc2\xb4-ter\r\n    piec\xc2\xb4-es\r\n    hair\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    yel\xc2\xb4-low\r\n    threads\r\n    mid\xc2\xb4-dle\r\n    break\r\n    leaves\r\n    seeds\r\n\r\n1. One day the children were out in the fields, running races, picking\r\nflowers, and making daisy-chains!\r\n\r\n2. When they began to feel tired and hungry, they got milk and cake out\r\nof mother\'s basket, and had a long rest on the dry, warm grass.\r\n\r\n3. \'How these buttercups shine!\' said Dora; \'they look like gold!\'\r\n\r\n\'Gold-cups, they ought to be called, not butter-cups,\' said Harry. \'They\r\nlook like cups, don\'t they?\'\r\n\r\n4. \'But they would not hold water like real cups. Look at this one; it\r\nis in five pieces.\'\r\n\r\n5. \'Five? Oh yes! And look underneath. There is another sort of cup with\r\nfive leaves in it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Only it is not bright and golden, but green and hairy.\'\r\n\r\n6. \'Now, you found that out, and I found the five yellow leaves. It is\r\nmy turn again. I can see yellow threads standing up in a ring all round\r\nthe middle of the cup, and their tops are thick.\'\r\n\r\n7. \'It is my turn now! In the very middle there is a green heap. It\r\nlooks as if the yellow threads were taking care of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, the heap is all made up of little round things! Look, I can pull it\r\nto pieces.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Butter-cup.]\r\n\r\n8. \'So can I,\' said Harry; \'here is one, here is another! They are not\r\nround after all, do you see? Each is round at the bottom, but has a\r\nlittle bent horn at the top.\'\r\n\r\n9. \'They must be seeds. I will break one open. Oh no! Just look, there\r\nis a little ball inside. Have you found a ball in yours?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, there is a ball in every one. It must be a seed, or a little egg.\'\r\n\r\n10. \'Birds have eggs,\' said Dora, \'plants have seeds.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it is all the same thing,\' said Harry.\r\n\r\n\'I think the green thing with a horn is only a case to take care of the\r\nseed.\'\r\n\r\n11. \'All these things seem to take care of each other. First, the green\r\nleaves at the back take care of the yellow cup.\'\r\n\r\n\'And the yellow cup takes care of the yellow threads.\'\r\n\r\n\'And the yellow threads take care of the green cases.\'\r\n\r\n\'And the green cases take care of the seeds.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAISIES AND BUTTERCUPS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Daisies.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    mead\xc2\xb4-ows\r\n    stalk\r\n    cov\xc2\xb4-ered\r\n    yel\xc2\xb4-low\r\n    maid\xc2\xb4-en\r\n    light\xc2\xb4-ly\r\n    ten\xc2\xb4-der\r\n    tread\r\n    win\xc2\xb4-ter\r\n    cun\xc2\xb4-ning\r\n    dai\xc2\xb4-sy\r\n    straight\r\n    ground\r\n    chil\xc2\xb4-dren\r\n    moss\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    but\xc2\xb4-ter\r\n\r\n\r\n                    I.\r\n\r\n    1.

There was a very little field at the bottom of the garden, and father\r\nmade up his mind to grow wheat in it.\r\n\r\n2. A friend kindly lent him a horse and plough, and the soil was quickly\r\nturned over. A few days afterwards the seed was sown.\r\n\r\n3. The children helped to do this.\r\n\r\nThey got up very early one morning and went out with their father. Harry\r\nhad a bag full of wheat, and Dora had a little basket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n4. They watched what their father did, then dipped their hands into the\r\nwheat, and threw it out over the earth.\r\n\r\n5. After that, the horse came again with a harrow, to cover the seed\r\nover with soil, and it was left to grow.\r\n\r\n6. It seemed strange to think that those little hard grains would grow\r\nup to be tall plants and have other grains upon them.\r\n\r\n7. \'I hope we shall have some nice soft rain,\' said father, as they left\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n8. Many days went by, rain came again and again. There was sunshine,\r\ntoo; but sometimes the east winds blew.\r\n\r\n9. Dora and Harry went out every morning to look at the field. But they\r\nalways came in saying that there was nothing but brown earth to be seen.\r\n\r\n10. At last, one morning they came in running and jumping. \'Our wheat is\r\nup! There are tiny green leaves all over the field!\'\r\n\r\n11. After this there was always something fresh to see. The wheat-plants\r\ngrew taller, and put out long leaves.\r\n\r\n12. Dora said one day that they looked like grass, and her mother told\r\nher that wheat was a large kind of grass.\r\n\r\n\'Look at the shape of the leaves,\' she said, \'and the joints in the\r\nstems.\'\r\n\r\n13. The wheat soon grew so tall that it stood above the heads of the\r\nchildren. They used to go in among it, and make believe that they were\r\nlost in a great forest.\r\n\r\n14. One day, when they were lost like this, they saw that the tops of\r\nthe stalks had opened. Inside there were green stems with green ears\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT.\r\n\r\nPART 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n    heard\r\n    talk\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    har\xc2\xb4-vest\r\n    sup\xc2\xb4-per\r\n    seemed\r\n    sur-prise\xc2\xb4\r\n    rail\xc2\xb4-way\r\n    heav\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    truck\r\n    mean\r\n    flour\r\n    lis\xc2\xb4-ten\r\n    han\xc2\xb4-dle\r\n    min\xc2\xb4-utes\r\n    treat\r\n    tea\r\n\r\n1. Every day the ears grew larger and harder, and then they began to\r\nlook yellow.\r\n\r\n2. The children, too, heard their father and mother talking about their\r\ngolden grain, and saying it was ripe.\r\n\r\n3. At last, one very hot day, they found that the time had come to cut\r\nthe wheat. A kind friend came to help, and Harry and Dora and the new\r\ndog jumped about and ran in and out, and thought that they helped too.\r\n\r\n4. The children talked much about their harvest, and mother made them a\r\nharvest-supper. What a day it was!\r\n\r\n5. It seemed so odd to have a bin full of grain just like the grain they\r\nhad sown in the spring.\r\n\r\n6. And now there was a great surprise for them. A railway-man came with\r\na heavy box on a truck, and when the box was opened, what do you think\r\nthere was inside?\r\n\r\nA mill--a fine new wheat-mill!\r\n\r\n7. \'We do not need now to go to the miller!\' said mother, looking very\r\nglad. \'We are going to have a miller in our own house--no, two millers,\r\nI ought to say!\'\r\n\r\n8. \'Two millers!\' cried Harry.\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean Harry and me?\' asked Dora.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, my dear children, I mean you. You are going to be my dusty\r\nmillers!\r\n\r\n9. \'I will show you how much you are to grind, just a little every day.\r\nYou must put it into this big red pan, and cover it up, and when I want\r\nto bake I shall always have plenty of flour ready.\r\n\r\n10. \'And listen! You shall have a penny each every week for doing the\r\nwork.\'\r\n\r\nAt this Dora and Harry jumped for joy, clapped their hands, and ran to\r\ntheir mother to hug her.\r\n\r\n11. Then she put some of the wheat into the mill, took hold of the\r\nhandle, and made the wheel go round. Harry next took his turn, and Dora\r\nhers, and in a few minutes they found in the box below a heap of nice\r\nsoft flour.\r\n\r\n12. \'Now,\' said mother, \'let us give father a treat when he comes home!\r\nWe will make some nice cakes with this flour, and have them for tea!\r\nGrind a little more, dear millers, while I make up the fire.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLATE.\r\n\r\nPART 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n    rid\xc2\xb4-dle\r\n    ex-act\xc2\xb4-ly\r\n    guessed\r\n    won\xc2\xb4-der\r\n    bought\r\n    Sat\xc2\xb4-ur-day\r\n    sup-pose\xc2\xb4\r\n    fin\xc2\xb4-gers\r\n    met\xc2\xb4-al\r\n    smooth\r\n    re-mem\xc2\xb4-ber\r\n    piece\r\n\r\n1. \'What is the oldest thing in this room?\' asked the mother one day.\r\n\r\n\'Is this a riddle?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, not exactly.\'\r\n\r\n2. Dora guessed one thing, and Harry another, and at last they gave up\r\nguessing. \'Unless,\' said Harry, \'it is the fender, or the poker.\'\r\n\r\n3. \'It is very likely that the thing you were drawing on just now is\r\nolder than any of those.\'\r\n\r\n4. \'That slate? Why, mother!\' cried the children, opening their eyes\r\nwide with wonder, \'you bought it only last Saturday!\'\r\n\r\n\'So I did. But it was not made last Saturday.\'\r\n\r\n5. \'No, I suppose the man cut it, and made the frame, and fixed it on\r\nbefore that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps on Friday,\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n6. \'But the slate itself,\' the mother went on, \'where did that come\r\nfrom? Did the man make it?\'\r\n\r\nHarry and Dora looked well at it, turned it over, rubbed their fingers\r\non it, and said they did not know.\r\n\r\n7. \'Well, would you say it is like wood, or like stone, or is it metal\r\nlike the poker? Is it a kind of wood, do you think? Did it ever grow?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think it must be a sort of rock, or stone,\' said Harry, \'only very\r\nsmooth and thin.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'The man who worked at it before it came to the shop made it smooth\r\nand cut it thin. It was not smooth and thin at first. But you are quite\r\nright; it is a sort of stone.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Slate Quarry]\r\n\r\n9. \'It is as cold as a stone,\' said Dora, putting it against her face.\r\n\'Do you remember, Harry, how cold our hands were in winter when we did\r\nsums? Yes, and it is very hard. I am sure it is a piece of rock.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLATE.\r\n\r\nPART 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n    should\r\n    laughed\r\n    high\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    thought\r\n    laugh\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    pur\xc2\xb4-pose\r\n    prop\xc2\xb4-er-ly\r\n    please\r\n    set\xc2\xb4-tled\r\n    hap\xc2\xb4-pened\r\n    deal\r\n    dead\r\n    weighted\r\n    through\r\n    heaved\r\n    brok\xc2\xb4-en\r\n\r\n1. \'I should like to see a rock all made of slate! Have you ever seen\r\none, mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, many, dear. But there are none near.\' Then she laughed a little.\r\n\'But if you like to go just outside the door you will see rows and rows\r\nof slates.\'\r\n\r\n2. Out they ran, looked all over the ground, then at the garden-wall,\r\nthen back at their mother, who had come to the door.\r\n\r\n\'Look at the house,\' she said, \'look higher!\'\r\n\r\n3. \'Oh, we never thought of the roof,\' they cried, and ran in again\r\nlaughing. \'But those slates are not so nice and smooth as our slates.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your slates are made smooth on purpose. Besides, they are made of\r\nbetter slate--older slate. The older the slate is the better it is.\'\r\n\r\n4. \'How old?\'\r\n\r\n\'No one knows. It is a long story, and no one can tell it properly.\r\nShall I tell you as much as I know?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, do, please, mother!\' and the two settled themselves at her feet.\r\n\r\n5. \'Well,\' she began, \'once upon a time there was a great stir at the\r\nbottom of the sea. The heat and gas under the ground broke through and\r\npushed out everything that was in the way.\r\n\r\n6. \'Stones, ashes, and dust came flying up through the water, and then\r\nfell back into the water again. When all was quiet, they settled down at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, and became mud.\r\n\r\n7. \'All this happened many times, till there was a great deal of mud.\r\nThen, little by little, the mud was covered up by other things.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'What sort of things?\'\r\n\r\n\'Dead fish, perhaps, and shells, and sand and mud that had been brought\r\nby rivers into the sea. These things lay on the top of the mud and\r\nweighed it down.\r\n\r\n9. \'The heat under the bottom of the sea still kept up, and made the mud\r\nvery hot, and baked it through. At last it gave a great push, and heaved\r\nthe mud up above the water, so that it became dry land.\r\n\r\n10. \'In other ways it was made harder and harder, until it was turned\r\ninto rock. And now we call it slate. Here is a bit of your old broken\r\nslate. See if you can turn it into mud again!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHALK.\r\n\r\nPART 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n    a-cross\xc2\xb4\r\n    morn\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    chalk\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    picked\r\n    piece\r\n    teach\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    black\xc2\xb4-board\r\n    spread\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    wheat\r\n    col\xc2\xb4-ours\r\n    fetch\r\n    laughed\r\n    earth\r\n    brown\r\n    moist\r\n    through\r\n\r\n1. A few days after this, Dora and Harry were going across the fields.\r\nThey saw a horse and cart standing, and a man taking white stones out of\r\nthe cart and putting them over the ground.\r\n\r\n2. \'Why, it is Joe!\' they cried, as they came nearer. \'Good-morning,\r\nJoe. What are you doing?\'\r\n\r\n\'Chalking this bit of land, you see. You know what chalk is, do you?\'\r\n\r\n3. Harry and Dora picked up a piece or two.\r\n\r\n\'Teacher writes on the blackboard with chalk,\' they said.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, you are right. It is used for many things,\' and he went on\r\nspreading it over the field.\r\n\r\n4. \'But what is it wanted here for, Joe?\'\r\n\r\n\'No chalk, no wheat!\' said Joe.\r\n\r\n\'Father put no chalk on our field, and we had such a heap of wheat!\'\r\n\r\n5. \'Yours is good land. This up here has never been used for farming. It\r\nhad little old trees on it, you know, and they were cut down and their\r\nroots dug out of the ground; and now, look at it! It is poor soil.\'\r\n\r\n6. \'How do you know it is poor?\'\r\n\r\n\'Look at the field below, what a nice brown it is! That will grow\r\nanything, but this is all colours--black, red, yellow, and green.\r\n\r\n7. \'I have been a long way to fetch this chalk: I started off with old\r\nDobbin this morning before it was light, and got it out of the\r\nchalk-pit.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'When we were fast asleep!\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n\'Then you don\'t buy chalk at a shop?\' said Harry.\r\n\r\nJoe laughed.\r\n\r\n\'No; it comes out of the ground.\'\r\n\r\n\'This is like the slate story,\' said Dora.\r\n\r\nHarry nodded.\r\n\r\n9. \'But, Joe, I want to know how the chalk makes the ground good.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know how, but it does. If it lies here for a year or more, the\r\nearth will turn brown, and we can grow wheat in it. Besides, chalk holds\r\nwater, and so it will keep the ground moist up here.\'\r\n\r\n10. \'How?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, when it rains, the water will not run away through the earth, but\r\nwill stay in the lumps of chalk. Are you going? Good-bye, then.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHALK.\r\n\r\nPART 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \'Fizz and bubble, bubble and fizz.\']\r\n\r\n\r\n    eve\xc2\xb4-ning\r\n    brought\r\n    vin\xc2\xb4-e-gar\r\n    bub\xc2\xb4-ble\r\n    air\r\n    stirred\r\n    poured\r\n    grains\r\n    hun\xc2\xb4-dreds\r\n    smiled\r\n    crowds\r\n    threads\r\n    catch\r\n    died\r\n    dropped\r\n    mixed\r\n\r\n1. The children had much to say that evening about Joe and the field.\r\nThey had brought home a lump of chalk.\r\n\r\n2. \'I will show you something,\' said father, and he got a cup of\r\nvinegar, crushed a little of the chalk, and dropped it into the cup.\r\n\r\nFizz and bubble, bubble and fizz!\r\n\r\n3. What was going on?\r\n\r\nWhen the stir came to an end, the chalk was not there!\r\n\r\n\'Part of it has gone off in gas,\' their father said. \'The rest is lime,\r\nand it is mixed with the vinegar.\'\r\n\r\n4. \'We did not see any gas,\' said Harry.\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t see gas. It is like air. All those bubbles were made by the\r\ngas. It went out of the cup into the air.\r\n\r\n\'Now, get a cup of water. Come along! Where is your chalk?\'\r\n\r\n5. Father rubbed some of it into the water, and stirred it up. The water\r\nnow looked like milk.\r\n\r\nFather poured it into the sink, and showed Harry and Dora, at the bottom\r\nof the cup, a great many tiny grains.\r\n\r\n6. \'Those little round things,\' he said, \'are shells.\'\r\n\r\n\'Shells!\' said Dora, trying to see them better.\r\n\r\n\'Were live things ever in them?\' asked Harry, and put a finger into the\r\ncup to fish some out.\r\n\r\n7. \'Yes, long, long ago. That bit of chalk had hundreds and hundreds of\r\nshells in it. Now, mother, it is your turn! I have had mine. What do you\r\nknow about chalk?\'\r\n\r\n8. Mother smiled and began: \'There was once a very deep sea, full of\r\nlive things, little and big. And on the top of the water were crowds of\r\ntiny things in shells, that put out long arms like threads to catch\r\ntheir food.\r\n\r\n9. \'When they died they all dropped to the bottom of the sea, and lay\r\nthere. The shells were so very little that they made a sort of mud when\r\nthey were mixed with the water.\r\n\r\n\'And now the mud is dry, and we call it chalk!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    an\xc2\xb4-i-mal\r\n    noise\r\n    mouse\r\n    cheese\r\n    har\xc2\xb4-vest\r\n    stalk\r\n    should\r\n    four\r\n    tail\r\n    nib\xc2\xb4-ble\r\n    young\r\n    beasts\r\n    squeak\r\n    hours\r\n    leaves\r\n    catch\r\n\r\n1. Harry came running in one day to say that he had seen a little animal\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\n2. \'It ran so fast, I could hardly see it. I looked a long time for it,\r\nand so did Dora, but we could not find it. Now, what do you think it\r\ncould be, mother?\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n3. Then in came Dora, \'It had a long tail, and was very little, and made\r\nno noise at all.\'\r\n\r\n4. \'It may have been a mouse,\' said their mother; \'very likely it was.\'\r\n\r\n\'But mice live indoors, do they not, and eat cheese, and run about in\r\nthe walls, and make holes?\'\r\n\r\n5. \'How do you know all this?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have heard them at grandmother\'s,\' said Harry. \'Do they ever live out\r\nof doors?\'\r\n\r\n6. \'A good many do. There is a pretty little thing called a\r\nharvest-mouse. It makes a nest like a bird\'s, and hangs it up on a stalk\r\nof wheat.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Harvest Mouse and Nest.]\r\n\r\n7. \'I wish there had been one in our wheat!\' said Dora. \'I should like\r\nto see the little nest and the baby-mice peeping out. They must be very,\r\nvery small.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'Yes, the harvest-mouse is the very smallest four-footed animal we\r\nhave. Then there is a field-mouse with a long tail, and a field-mouse\r\nwith a short tail. Mr Short-tail likes to nibble at young trees.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, that is not our mouse! He had a long tail.\'\r\n\r\n9. \'And then there is a wood-mouse.\'\r\n\r\n\'Has he a short tail or long tail?\' asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\'Long. I must tell you about a man who used to go out in the night in\r\nwild places to see what birds and beasts were doing when most of us\r\nwere in bed.\r\n\r\n10. \'One of the things he found out was that field-mice could sing!\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t they squeak?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; and he often heard them go on for hours making a kind of singing.\r\n\r\n11. \'Sometimes they were close by him as he lay on the ground, and he\r\nwould put out his hand to catch one. But when he opened it again it was\r\nfull of grass or moss or leaves; and there was no mouse.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did he never catch one?\'\r\n\r\n\'Never.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIELD-MOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    tum\xc2\xb4-bles\r\n    ber\xc2\xb4-ry\r\n    brown\r\n    mer\xc2\xb4-ry\r\n    scarce\xc2\xb4-ly\r\n    weath\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    nib\xc2\xb4-bling\r\n    fruits\r\n    farm\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    stacks\r\n    treas\xc2\xb4-ure\r\n    pleas\xc2\xb4-ure\r\n    reared\xc2\xb4\r\n    un-der-neath\xc2\xb4\r\n    shad\xc2\xb4-ow\r\n    mead\xc2\xb4-ow\r\n\r\n    1.

Harry and Dora were coming home with their mother from a long walk,\r\nwhen they saw some rabbits playing about on the grass.\r\n\r\n2. They wished to stay and watch them, and the three sat down on a log a\r\nlittle way off.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, look at that one going into a hole!\' said Dora. \'See his funny\r\ntail. Why is he going into a hole?\'\r\n\r\n3. \'That is his house,\' said their mother. \'I daresay he is sleepy and\r\nwants to go to bed.\'\r\n\r\n\'He goes early, then, like the birds?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, about sunset. He gets up a little before sunrise.\r\n\r\n4. \'There goes another! They will soon all be gone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then we can look at their houses?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only at their front doors. If you were to sit quite still over there in\r\nthe day-time, you would see the rabbits popping in and out.\r\n\r\n5. \'After a time they would find out that you were their friends, and\r\nthen you would be able to watch their doings.\'\r\n\r\n6. Then mother told them more about the man who often stayed out all\r\nnight to see what animals did. \'One morning, before it was quite light,\r\nhe heard a tap-tap near him, and saw a rabbit beating on the ground with\r\nhis hind-feet close to another rabbit\'s hole.\r\n\r\n7. \'He saw him go to another hole and tap there, and then to another.\r\nSome holes he passed and did not knock at all.\r\n\r\n\'At last he had just begun tap-tapping in front of a hole, when out\r\nrushed a big rabbit. They began to fight, and they both rolled down to\r\nthe bottom of the hill.\r\n\r\n8. \'The man often saw rabbits tapping like this. Sometimes two or three\r\nwould come out to speak to the one that tapped, and they seemed to have\r\na friendly chat.\r\n\r\n9. \'There was another sound they could make with their hind-feet. If one\r\nof them made it, the others would run into their holes as fast as they\r\ncould. It meant danger.\'\r\n\r\n\'What was it like?\' asked Dora.\r\n\r\n\'_Tap-pat._\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIVY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    win\xc2\xb4-ter\r\n    vase\r\n    changed\r\n    sprays\r\n    be-tween\xc2\xb4\r\n    pur\xc2\xb4-pose\r\n    um-brel\xc2\xb4-la\r\n    mid\xc2\xb4-dle\r\n    straight\r\n    veins\r\n    flow\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    thick\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    thread\r\n    ten\xc2\xb4-der\r\n    mouth\r\n    use\xc2\xb4-ful\r\n\r\n1. Some sprigs of ivy had been standing all the winter in a vase. The\r\nwater had often been changed, and the leaves washed.\r\n\r\n2. When spring came each spray began to put out buds. The buds were not\r\nall at the ends of the sprays, but came out also close to the old\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n3. At last there was a very small bud between every old leaf and the\r\nstem. When the first bud opened into a leaf, Dora and Harry clapped\r\ntheir hands, and called every one to look.\r\n\r\n4. \'How clean and sweet it is!\' cried Dora. \'And do you see something\r\nlike wool or hair on it?\'\r\n\r\n\'How curly it is!\' said Harry. \'It is not quite open yet. Why, it is\r\nlike a hand! All the leaves look rather like hands, don\'t they? See;\r\none, two, three, four, five!\'\r\n\r\n5. \'Look at this old leaf against the light,\' said the mother; \'now you\r\ncan see the five long fingers. But people call them ribs, not fingers!\r\nThey are for the purpose of keeping the leaf spread out.\'\r\n\r\n6. \'Like the ribs of an umbrella,\' said Harry. \'They seem very strong;\r\nthe middle one, which goes up straight from the stem, is the strongest\r\nof all.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spray of Ivy.]\r\n\r\n7. Dora was holding up one spray after another to the light. \'What are\r\nall these pretty marks on the leaves, mother, lines crossing about all\r\nways?\'\r\n\r\n\'Those are veins, dear. They carry the sap that feeds the leaves.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'What is sap?\'\r\n\r\n\'The blood of plants and trees.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh,\' said Dora, \'then that is the wet that comes out when I pick a\r\nflower or cut a leaf!\r\n\r\n9. \'But look at this!\' and she held up one of the sprays.\r\n\r\nAt the end of it was a little bunch of white, curly roots. Each root was\r\nnot much thicker than a thread.\r\n\r\n10. \'Don\'t touch them,\' said the mother; \'roots are very tender things.\'\r\n\r\n\'What is the good of them?\' asked Dora.\r\n\r\n\'What is your mouth useful for?\' asked her mother.\r\n\r\n11. \'Oh, do you mean that the ivy eats and drinks?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, that is what I mean. These roots take out of the water, or out of\r\nthe earth, all sorts of things good for the food of the plant. They then\r\nsend them up into the stem and on into the leaves.\'\r\n\r\n12. \'Mother,\' said Harry, \'let us go and plant all this ivy. I am sure\r\nit wants to try the taste of the earth!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    rab\xc2\xb4-bits\r\n    shoots\r\n    ta\xc2\xb4-ble\r\n    spread\r\n    rough\r\n    heard\r\n    birch\r\n    beech\r\n    branch\xc2\xb4-es\r\n    caught\r\n    oak\r\n    found\r\n\r\n1. \'Let us go over to that log where we sat when we saw the rabbits,\'\r\nsaid Dora to Harry.\r\n\r\n2. \'All right! We can play at ship, and the grass shall be the sea.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or we can have see-saw, if we can find some wood to lay across the\r\nlog.\'\r\n\r\n3. They were soon at the log, and on it they sat down, and looked about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe log was the trunk of an old oak, and a little way off stood the\r\nstump, with many new shoots and leaves coming out all round it.\r\n\r\n4. Dora went and stood on it, and called out that she was on a hill. She\r\njumped off and on a few times, and then said it would make a good table,\r\nand they might have tea on it.\r\n\r\n5. Harry found that the stump had roots that spread out all round for a\r\nlong way.\r\n\r\n\'How thick and hard they are!\' he said; \'come and feel this one!\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It is all marked in rings.]\r\n\r\n\'It is not like the roots we saw on the ivy,\' she said. \'Now look at the\r\ntop of the stump. It is all marked in rings.\'\r\n\r\n6. \'In the very middle there is a little light spot, and then come dark\r\nrings, and then more rings outside. Father once told me these rings\r\nshowed how old the trees were. And do you see lines coming away from the\r\nmiddle?\'\r\n\r\n7. \'They look like the rays of the sun, which I draw on my slate,\' said\r\nDora. \'What a rough coat this tree had! Come and feel the outside of the\r\nlog.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is the bark! I have heard father talk about bark.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'Well, I shall call it the coat. It is the tree\'s overcoat to keep\r\nhim warm and dry. But trees do not all seem to have rough coats. Look at\r\nthat one!\' and she ran over to a little birch, and pulled off some of\r\nits thin bark.\r\n\r\n9. \'I have found a fine tree!\' cried Harry; and Dora came running to\r\nlook at it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leaves of the Beech and the Oak.]\r\n\r\n10. It was a beech, with a great round smooth trunk and long strong\r\nbranches. Harry jumped up and caught at a leaf or two, and then went to\r\npick an oak-leaf. He laid them side by side on his hand and looked at\r\nthem, and found they were not at all alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRICKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    stopped\r\n    emp\xc2\xb4-ty\r\n    mor\xc2\xb4-tar\r\n    sound\r\n    trow\xc2\xb4-el\r\n    struck\r\n    picked\r\n    size\r\n    teach\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    re\xc2\xb4-al-ly\r\n    clay\r\n    win\xc2\xb4-ter\r\n    breaks\r\n    moulds\r\n    nice\xc2\xb4-ly\r\n    ov\xc2\xb4-en\r\n\r\n1. Two men were making a wall by the road-side, and Harry and Dora\r\nstopped to look at them.\r\n\r\n2. Another man was going away with a horse and cart. The cart was empty,\r\nbut it had been full of red bricks. The men were putting these bricks on\r\nthe wall and making them fast with mortar.\r\n\r\n3. Dora liked the sound which the trowel made when it struck against the\r\nwall. Harry picked up one of the bricks and looked at it, and then Dora\r\nmust look at one too.\r\n\r\n4. They found that the bricks were light and easy to lift. They also\r\nsaw that they were all of the same size and shape, as if they had been\r\nmade, and not dug out of the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n5. They did not like to ask the men about them, and so they put the\r\nbricks down, and set off on their way home.\r\n\r\n6. As they went they met their teacher, who stopped and spoke to them,\r\nso Harry asked her to tell them what bricks really were.\r\n\r\n7. \'I wish there were a brick-field near,\' she said, \'and then we would\r\ngo and see it! But I can tell you a little about it.\r\n\r\n8. \'Bricks are made of clay, and clay is dug out of the ground. Men dig\r\nit before winter comes, and let it lie out all the winter, and the frost\r\nbreaks it up nicely for them.\r\n\r\n9. \'The next thing is to mix it well into a paste, and then it is put\r\ninto moulds.\'\r\n\r\n\'What are moulds?\' Harry asked.\r\n\r\n\'Well, these moulds are like boxes with no bottom or top.\'\r\n\r\n\'Only sides, then?\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n10. \'Yes, they have two long sides, and two short ones, and they hold\r\nthe soft, wet clay.\r\n\r\n\'You may call them clay-puddings before they are put into the hot oven.\r\nWhen they are taken out, what do you think they are? They are bricks!\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DONKEY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n    bot\xc2\xb4-tom\r\n    lane\r\n    don\xc2\xb4-key\r\n    load\r\n    fruit\r\n    this\xc2\xb4-tles\r\n    hedge\r\n    rough\r\n    ap-ple\r\n    car\xc2\xb4-rot\r\n    touch\r\n    mor\xc2\xb4-row\r\n    feast\r\n    win\xc2\xb4-dow\r\n    shag\xc2\xb4-gy\r\n    tuft\r\n\r\n1. At the bottom of the lane lived a donkey. Harry and Dora knew him\r\nwell. They often met him going to town with a load of fruit, and they\r\nsaw him in the lane every day cropping the grass and thistles by the\r\nhedge-side.\r\n\r\n2. He knew them, too, for they would stop to pat his rough sides, or\r\ngive him an apple or a carrot.\r\n\r\n3. They wondered how he could eat such prickly things as thistles. A\r\nhorse would never touch them.\r\n\r\n4. One day his master took him into the garden while he was working. He\r\nlet Neddy go up and down the paths and crop the grass, which had grown\r\nlong on the little grass-plot.\r\n\r\n5. The donkey did not once try to get at the pears and apples; he did\r\nnot even look at them.\r\n\r\n6. His master was pleased, and said to his wife: \'It is quite safe to\r\nleave the gate open, and let Neddy come into the garden when he likes. I\r\nshall be away to-morrow, but you need not look after him. He will be all\r\nright.\'\r\n\r\n7. Next day, Neddy walked into the garden, found that no one was there,\r\nand began to eat the fruit. He had a good feast before his mistress saw\r\nhim from the window.\r\n\r\n8. Then he was driven out, and the gate was shut. After that he always\r\nhad to find his dinner in the lane.\r\n\r\n9. The children saw him one day feeding with a white horse that had\r\ncome down from the farm, and they stopped to talk to them.\r\n\r\n10. Then Dora said to Harry:\r\n\r\n\'They are like each other, and yet not like! Neddy has a shaggy coat.\'\r\n\r\n\'And his mane is short, and stands up.\'\r\n\r\n\'His ears are very long.\'\r\n\r\n\'His tail is not like Snowflake\'s tail; and, see, it has a little tuft\r\nat the end of it!\'\r\n\r\n\'And Snowflake is much taller.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP.\r\n\r\n\r\n    chalk\r\n    wheth\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    earth\r\n    hedge\r\n    tear\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    swal\xc2\xb4-low\r\n    chew\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    though\r\n    re-mem\xc2\xb4-ber\r\n    for-got\xc2\xb4-ten\r\n    brought\r\n    mouth\r\n\r\n1. The next time that Dora and Harry were out, they ran up to the place\r\nwhere they had met Joe. They wished to see how the chalk was getting on,\r\nand whether the earth was brown yet.\r\n\r\n2. After that they went over a stile into a field where many sheep were\r\nfeeding. The sheep began to move away when they saw the boy and girl\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n3. Then said Harry: \'Let us try mother\'s plan of keeping quite still and\r\nletting them see that we don\'t want to hurt them.\'\r\n\r\n4. So they sat down under a hedge and looked at the sheep for a long\r\ntime, and soon one and another began to come near, eating away at the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n5. \'I like that sound of tearing off the grass, don\'t you?\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n\'Do you see they swallow it all at once?\' said Harry. \'What would\r\nmother say to us if we ate without chewing?\'\r\n\r\n6. \'There is some chewing going on, though. Look over there!\' and she\r\nshowed him some sheep that were lying down in the grass.\r\n\r\n7. \'Oh, now I know! Don\'t you remember, Dora, father told us once what\r\nthe cow does. It was that day we had tea at the farm.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'No, I don\'t remember. We saw the cows milked, and I had some new\r\nmilk in a glass. I don\'t think father told me!\'\r\n\r\n9. \'Yes, he did. You must have forgotten. He said that the cow sent her\r\nfood down into a big bag inside, and then it went into a smaller bag,\r\nwhere it was rolled up into little balls. And when the cow lay down to\r\nrest, she brought them up into her mouth and chewed them well.\'\r\n\r\n10. \'I should think the sheep must be doing the same thing. Look at this\r\nfat one close by! She is just sitting down. Now watch!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I can see her chewing! How funny it is! They all look as if they\r\nliked it, don\'t they?\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHEEP.\r\n\r\n\r\n    la\xc2\xb4-zy\r\n    pleas\xc2\xb4-ant\r\n    dai\xc2\xb4-sies\r\n    clothes\r\n    chil\xc2\xb4-ly\r\n    dew\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    scant\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    com\xc2\xb4-mon\r\n    brown\r\n    mer\xc2\xb4-ry\r\n    wool\xc2\xb4-ly\r\n    coat\r\n\r\n    1.  \'Lazy sheep, pray tell me why\r\n        In the pleasant fields you lie,\r\n        Eating grass and daisies white,\r\n        From the morning till the night?\r\n        Everything can something do;\r\n        Oh what kind of use are you?\'\r\n\r\n    2.  \'Nay, my little fellow, nay,\r\n        Do not serve me so, I pray:\r\n        Don\'t you see the wool that grows\r\n        On my back to make you clothes?\r\n        Cold and very cold you\'d be,\r\n        If you had not wool from me.\r\n\r\n    3.  \'True, it seems a pleasant thing,\r\n        To nip the daisies in the spring;\r\n        But many chilly nights I pass,\r\n        On the cold and dewy grass,\r\n        Or pick a scanty dinner where\r\n        All the common\'s brown and bare.\r\n\r\n    4.  \'Then the farmer comes at last,\r\n        When the merry spring is past,\r\n        And cuts my woolly coat away,\r\n        To warm you in the winter\'s day.\r\n        Little Master, this is why\r\n        In the pleasant fields I lie.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    white\r\n    ly\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    tur\xc2\xb4-nip\r\n    picked\r\n    win\xc2\xb4-ter\r\n    din\xc2\xb4-ner\r\n    read\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    but\xc2\xb4-ter\r\n    sor\xc2\xb4-ry\r\n    heard\r\n    peo\xc2\xb4-ple\r\n    bread\r\n    pressed\r\n    meal\r\n    mean\r\n    jok\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n\r\n1. \'What are those sheep eating over there, at the far end of the field?\r\nThere is something white all over the grass.

They found that the white things\r\nlying about on the grass were bits of turnip.\r\n\r\nHarry picked one up and looked at it. It was only a round rind: all the\r\ninside had been eaten out.\r\n\r\n3. He took it home with him to show to his mother, and she said:\r\n\r\n\'I saw some bits like this that were shooting out green leaves when\r\nspring came. They had been lying out on the ground in the winter, yet\r\nthere was so much life in them that they could grow again. But, come,\r\nwash your hands: dinner is ready, and I have something to tell you. We\r\nare going to have turnips for dinner!\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He took it home with him to show to his mother.]\r\n\r\n4. When Harry had his helping of turnips he said:\r\n\r\n\'Now I am a sheep!\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Dora, \'the sheep don\'t boil their turnips, or mash them with\r\nnice butter.\'\r\n\r\n5. \'But raw turnip is very nice,\' said her father. \'I have often eaten\r\none out in the fields. I am not at all sorry for the sheep.\'\r\n\r\n6. \'I have heard,\' said mother, \'that, when corn was very dear, people\r\nhad to use turnips in making bread. They say the bread looked good, and\r\nkept well. The water was first pressed out of the turnips, and then they\r\nwere mixed with wheat-meal.\'\r\n\r\n7. \'I wish you would make some, mother,\' said Dora, \'just for fun, to\r\nsee what it is like.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will--some day.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'What did you mean, mother,\' Harry asked, \'about water in turnips?\'\r\n\r\n\'There is a great deal of water in turnips,\' said mother.\r\n\r\n9. \'Turnips are nearly all water,\' said father.\r\n\r\n\'Now, father, you must be joking,\' cried Harry.\r\n\r\n\'No, I am not. Am I, mother?\'\r\n\r\nMother smiled, and said \'No.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN PEAS.\r\n\r\nPART 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n    peas\r\n    flow\xc2\xb4-ers\r\n    ten\xc2\xb4-drils\r\n    un-rolled\xc2\xb4\r\n    watched\r\n    thought\r\n    pur\xc2\xb4-pose\r\n    but\xc2\xb4-ter-flies\r\n    half\r\n    count\xc2\xb4-ed\r\n    true\r\n    flow\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    with\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    stayed\r\n    shin\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    touched\r\n\r\n1. Dora was alone in the garden. She had played about till she was\r\ntired, when she found herself close to the bed of peas. She had seen her\r\nfather sow the peas, and now there were tall plants with leaves and\r\nflowers and green tendrils.\r\n\r\n2. Dora unrolled one or two of these tendrils, and then watched them\r\nroll up again. She thought:\r\n\r\n\'How funny it is of the plant to put these out on purpose to take hold\r\nof the sticks! And how pretty the flowers are! They look like little\r\nwhite butterflies. I will pull one open.\'\r\n\r\n3. She picked a flower, and sat down with it on the grass. Inside of it\r\nshe found something long and green. This she opened, and saw a row of\r\ntiny green balls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pea-flower.]\r\n\r\n4. Not one of them was half as big as a pin\'s head. They were all in a\r\nrow, and Dora counted seven of them.\r\n\r\nShe picked out each one and laid them on her hand to look at.\r\n\r\n5. Then it came into her mind that these little mites of things must be\r\nbaby-peas. And she felt sorry to think what she had done, for she could\r\nnot put them back into their nest, and now they would never grow up to\r\nbe big.\r\n\r\n6. She told Harry about it next day, and he said, yes, it was very true.\r\nBut he must pull open just one flower himself and see the peas inside;\r\nand so he did. There were six peas in his flower.\r\n\r\n7. Every day after this, Dora and Harry came to look at the plants.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the flowers were very pretty. Then they began to wither.\r\nOne by one they dropped off; but the inside part of each stayed on,\r\nlooking green and shiny.\r\n\r\n8. The children called these shiny green things bags, till they heard\r\nsome one say that they were pods.\r\n\r\nSometimes they touched them. They soon began to feel the peas inside.\r\nThe pods grew larger and fatter every day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN PEAS.\r\n\r\nPART 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n    bas\xc2\xb4-ket\r\n    shell\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    bas\xc2\xb4-in\r\n    taught\r\n    won\xc2\xb4-der-ful\r\n    break\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    fair\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    hap\xc2\xb4-pens\r\n    weath\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    earth\r\n    moist\r\n    pea\r\n    su\xc2\xb4-gar\r\n    starch\r\n    earth\r\n    sun\xc2\xb4-light\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pea-pods.]\r\n\r\n1. At last, one sunny morning, mother came out with a basket and began\r\nto pick the pods. Harry and Dora wished to help her, and all three were\r\nsoon at work.\r\n\r\n2. Next, the shelling began. Mother had a basin in her lap, and the two\r\nchildren sat close to her and shelled their peas into it.\r\n\r\n3. They told her how they had shelled the baby-peas. She taught them how\r\neach plant was a living thing, and had a tiny plant inside of it, all\r\nready to come out at the right time. This was very wonderful.\r\n\r\n4. \'Did that big plant come out of one little pea?\' cried Dora.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t see a little plant inside,\' said\r\n\r\nHarry, breaking one of the peas open.\r\n\r\n5. \'Yet it is there, a fairy-plant, with a root, a stem, and two leaves.\r\nThese leaves take up nearly all the room in the green ball. How would\r\nyou like to have two or three of these peas to plant? There! I can spare\r\nyou three each from to-day\'s dinner.\'\r\n\r\n6. The children were glad to have them. \'I wish we could see them grow,\'\r\nsaid Dora. \'What happens, mother, when they are in the earth?\'\r\n\r\n7. \'Do you mean, How do they begin to grow? Well, the weather must be\r\nrather warm, and the earth moist, and the pea swells itself out till it\r\nbursts open its thin coat. The little root goes down to fasten it firmly\r\nin the ground, and to look for food. Then the little stem and the two\r\nleaves come up to get air and sunshine. That is how it begins.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'What food is there in the ground? What food do the roots find?\'\r\n\r\n\'Lime and iron\'----\r\n\r\n\'Iron!\' cried Harry.\r\n\r\n9. \'Yes, there is iron in green peas! There are sugar, too, and starch,\r\nand fat, and water, and other things. Some come out of the earth, some\r\ncome out of the air and the sunlight, and some the plant makes for\r\nitself. Oh, it is a very clever plant! But all plants are clever, I\r\nthink.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON AND METAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    pock\xc2\xb4-ets\r\n    mar\xc2\xb4-bles\r\n    wrapped\r\n    size\r\n    heav\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    weight\r\n    light\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    though\r\n    cop\xc2\xb4-per\r\n    thought\r\n    zinc\r\n    met\xc2\xb4-als\r\n    sup-pose\xc2\xb4\r\n    wheat\r\n    i\xc2\xb4-ron\r\n    ket\xc2\xb4-tle\r\n\r\n1. \'What have you in your pockets, father?\' asked Harry, pulling at\r\nthem. \'Nuts? stones? marbles?\'\r\n\r\n\'Put your hand in, and find out. Here, Dora, you can try the other\r\npocket.\'\r\n\r\n2. In went two hands, and out came little hard lumps, each wrapped in\r\npaper. The children laid them on the table in a row, and wanted to know\r\nwhat they were.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \'What have you in your pockets, father?\']\r\n\r\n3. They were not nuts, nor marbles, and not quite like stones. They were\r\nall about the same size, but one was very heavy. Harry and Dora held it\r\nin their hands to feel how heavy it was.\r\n\r\n4. \'That is a bit of lead,\' said their father. \'Which do you think is\r\nthe next in weight?\'\r\n\r\n\'This red one. It is a good deal lighter, though!\'\r\n\r\n\'That is called copper. Now, what comes next?\'\r\n\r\n5. They were not sure, but thought that iron came next, and then tin,\r\nand then zinc. Their father told them these names as they went on. He\r\ntold them also that all these things were metals, and had been dug out\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\n6. \'Suppose we make a box to keep them in?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes!\' cried both.\r\n\r\n\'And if we find any more things like these, we will put them in.\r\n\r\n7. \'Would you put in a buttercup?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no!\'\r\n\r\n\'Or a grain of wheat?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, it is not at all like these.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or a bit of slate?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think so,\' said Harry.\r\n\r\nDora was not quite sure.\r\n\r\n8. \'Yes, we will put the slate into the box. It is not a metal, but it\r\ncame out of the ground. Now, what do you say to this?\' And he pulled out\r\na lump that looked like earth and stone.\r\n\r\n9. What could this be? It was iron, just as it had come out of the\r\nground, with clay and earth about it.\r\n\r\n10. \'Once upon a time,\' said father, \'the kettle, and the poker, and the\r\nfender, all looked like this!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAIRY RING.\r\n\r\n\r\n    danc\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    fair\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    queen\r\n    sea\xc2\xb4-sons\r\n    year\r\n    cir\xc2\xb4-cle\r\n    sphere\r\n    sum\xc2\xb4-mer\r\n    glide\r\n    au\xc2\xb4-tumn\r\n    tress\xc2\xb4-es\r\n    cheeks\r\n\r\n    1.

Harry and Dora once had a great treat.\r\n\r\nThey went in the holidays to stay with an uncle and aunt who lived at a\r\ntown where needles were made. We may call it Needle-town.\r\n\r\n2. While they were there, they were taken to the mills to see the\r\nneedles made.\r\n\r\n3. The first room into which they went was very warm. It was called the\r\nwire-room. A workman who was there told them that it was filled with hot\r\nair night and day, so that no damp should come in and spoil the steel.\r\n\r\n4. All round the room coils of steel-wire were hanging. They were\r\nwrapped up in paper, but the man took some of them down and let them\r\nlook in. They saw that one coil was of very thick wire, while another\r\nwas of wire as fine as a hair.\r\n\r\n5. \'One of these coils would be more than a mile long if it were\r\nstretched out straight,\' the man told Harry. \'Would you like to take\r\nhold of this one?\'\r\n\r\nBut Harry found it too heavy, and it was hung up again on the wall.\r\n\r\n6. Then they went into another room, where a machine was cutting a coil\r\nof wire into bits.\r\n\r\n\'They are much too long for needles,\' said Dora, softly, to her uncle;\r\nbut one of the workmen heard her, and said:\r\n\r\n7. \'So they are! Each bit is going to be two needles. The two ends are\r\nto be the points, and the heads lie in the middle of the wire.\'\r\n\r\n8. But no heads were to be seen yet. And the wire was not even straight,\r\nfor it had long been rolled up in a coil. As the machine went on\r\nchopping, and the wire-strips dropped, a man picked them up and put them\r\non a shelf in a sort of oven.\r\n\r\n9. There they were kept till they were red-hot, and then they were soft\r\nenough to be made straight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEEDLES.\r\n\r\nPART 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \'Now you see the points of the needles.\']\r\n\r\n\r\n    points\r\n    heads\r\n    eyes\r\n    un\xc2\xb4-cle\r\n    block\r\n    heav\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    ham\xc2\xb4-mer\r\n    al-lowed\xc2\xb4\r\n    laugh\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    watched\r\n    piece\r\n    sharp\r\n\r\n1. The next thing that the children saw was a grindstone turning round\r\nvery, very fast.\r\n\r\n2. A man put the bits of wire into a thing which was fixed just over the\r\ngrindstone, and both ends were quickly rubbed sharp.\r\n\r\n3. \'Now you see the points of the needles,\' said the man, as the wire\r\ncame out again.\r\n\r\n\'But there are no heads yet!\' said Harry.\r\n\r\n\'And no eyes!\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n\'Well, come along to the stamping-room,\' said their uncle.\r\n\r\n4. In this room they found a block of stone that had iron on the top of\r\nit. Over it hung a heavy hammer. A man who stood there took one of the\r\nwires, put it on the block, and made the hammer come down upon it.\r\n\r\n5. The moment the hammer went up again the wire fell into a pan, and the\r\nchildren were allowed to look at it.\r\n\r\n6. Still there were no eyes or heads! All that could be seen were two\r\nlittle dents, one on each side of the middle of the wire.\r\n\r\n7. \'But, look again!\' said uncle. \'Don\'t you see a tiny dot in each\r\ndent? That is where the eye is going to be.\'\r\n\r\n8. In the next room they found a great number of boys at work.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, uncle,\' said Harry, \'do you think I could come here and help to\r\nmake needles?\'\r\n\r\n\'You would soon be tired of it,\' said his uncle, laughing.\r\n\r\n9. They went up to one of the boys, and watched him for some time. He\r\ntook some wires that had come from the stamping-room, and laid them on a\r\npiece of iron, but held the two ends in his hands.\r\n\r\n10. Then a heavy thing with two hard, sharp, steel points under it came\r\ndown on the middle part of the wires, and made two holes just where the\r\ndots had been.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\'Now we see the eyes, at last!\' cried Dora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEEDLES.\r\n\r\nPART 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n    thread\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    to-geth\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    tooth\xc2\xb4-comb\r\n    smooth\r\n    rough\r\n    edg\xc2\xb4-es\r\n    nee\xc2\xb4-dle\r\n    thought\r\n    ov\xc2\xb4-en\r\n    sec\xc2\xb4-ond\r\n    steam\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    e-nough\xc2\xb4\r\n    break\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    bench\r\n    ham\xc2\xb4-mer\r\n    straight\r\n\r\n1. They went on into another room. Here there were boys again! And what\r\nwere the boys doing? They were threading the wires together.\r\n\r\n2. When they were all strung together, they looked like a long\r\ntooth-comb. The heads were in the middle, and the points lay on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\n3. The boys took them to some of the workmen, and these men made the\r\nmiddle part quite smooth. Rough edges had been left along the tiny\r\ndents, and had to be rubbed down.\r\n\r\n4. When this was done, a man made a line along the middle of the \'comb,\'\r\nand then gently bent it backwards and forwards till it broke right in\r\nthe middle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n5. Harry and Dora were glad to see this. Each bit of wire looked like a\r\nneedle now. It had a head of its own, and an eye, and a point.\r\n\r\n6. The next thing was to make the needles hard. Dora and Harry thought\r\nthey looked quite hard already, but they did not know.\r\n\r\n7. How were they hardened? They were first laid on iron plates and put\r\ninto a kind of oven.\r\n\r\n\'This is the second baking they have had,\' said Harry.\r\n\r\nThey were kept in till they were white-hot.\r\n\r\n8. When the needles came out, they were put into cold water! What a\r\nhissing and steaming they made! But they had to lie there till they were\r\nquite cool.\r\n\r\n9. Then they were taken out and dried. The man said they were hard\r\nenough now, but something else must be done to them to make them able to\r\nbend well without breaking.\r\n\r\n10. They were put on an iron plate over a fire, and gently moved about.\r\nSome of them curled up, and had to be taken off.\r\n\r\n11. They were given to a woman, who was sitting on a bench with a little\r\nhammer in her hand and a small steel block in front of her. She laid a\r\ncurly needle on the block, and hammered it till it was straight, and\r\nthen another, and another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEEDLES.\r\n\r\nPART 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n    clean\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    piece\r\n    can\xc2\xb4-vas\r\n    soap\r\n    oil\r\n    em\xc2\xb4-er-y\r\n    pow\xc2\xb4-der\r\n    bun\xc2\xb4-dle\r\n    man\xc2\xb4-gle\r\n    a-fraid\xc2\xb4\r\n    brok\xc2\xb4-en\r\n    sec\xc2\xb4-ond\r\n    Fri\xc2\xb4-day\r\n    points\r\n    hun\xc2\xb4-gry\r\n    laugh\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n\r\n1. The cleaning of the needles came next.\r\n\r\n2. A great many were laid side by side on a piece of canvas, and covered\r\nwith paste.\r\n\r\n\'What is the paste made of?\' Harry wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\'Soft soap, my lad,\' said the workman, \'and oil, and emery-powder.\'\r\n\r\n3. He rolled them all up in the canvas, tied string round the bundle,\r\nand put it between the rollers of a thing that looked like a mangle.\r\n\r\n4. Dora and Harry opened their eyes wide. \'Think of needles being\r\nmangled! This will be something to tell mother!\'\r\n\r\n5. When the bundle was unrolled, they were afraid that the needles would\r\nbe broken. But they were all right, and they were taken out and washed\r\nin warm soap-suds.\r\n\r\n6. \'Now they must be clean!\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n\'Not yet,\' said the man; \'they have to be rolled up again with more\r\npaste, and put between those rollers again, and again, and again. It\r\ntakes eight days to clean the best needles.\r\n\r\n7. \'And it takes six days to clean the second-best,\' said the man.\r\n\r\n\'Then even the second-best won\'t be done till Friday!\' said Harry.\r\n\r\n8. \'But we can go and see some needles that have been cleaned,\' said his\r\nuncle. \'Let us go up-stairs again.\'\r\n\r\n9. And they went up into a room where many girls were sitting at a long\r\ntable with heaps of bright needles before them. They were putting them\r\nin order, side by side, heads all one way, points another.\r\n\r\nDora was sure that she could not pick them out so quickly.\r\n\r\n10. They were going on into another room to see the eyes of the needles\r\nmade smooth, when Dora said, \'Oh, uncle, I am so tired!\'\r\n\r\n\'So am I,\' said Harry, \'and hungry, too.\'\r\n\r\n11. \'Come along, then,\' said uncle, laughing. \'We all want our dinners,\r\nI think.\' He took Dora\'s hand in his, and away they went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KNIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ro\xc2\xb4-ley\r\n    po\xc2\xb4-ley\r\n    thought\r\n    morn\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    knife\r\n    least\r\n    blade\r\n    han\xc2\xb4-dle\r\n    aunt\xc2\xb4-ie\r\n    edg\xc2\xb4-es\r\n    rath\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    clock\r\n\r\n1. There was not much talking at dinner, till after the second helping\r\nof roley-poley.\r\n\r\n2. Then Dora and Harry felt happy again, and began to tell their aunt\r\nall about the needle-making. She had seen it once, but it was a long\r\ntime ago, and she thought she should like to see it again.\r\n\r\n3. \'But if I had gone this morning,\' she said, \'you would not have had\r\nyour pudding.\'\r\n\r\n\'That would have been sad,\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n4. \'What a lot of steel we have seen,\' said Harry. \'I never knew there\r\nwas so much in the world.\'\r\n\r\n5. \'You can see some on this table now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where?\'\r\n\r\n\'What have I cut the pudding with?\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\'Oh, the knife! Yes, I see; that must be steel; at least, that part of\r\nit. What do you call that part?\'\r\n\r\n\'The blade.\'\r\n\r\n6. \'And what about the handle?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know. It is yellow, and smooth, and hard.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is bone,\' said his uncle, \'part of an ox-bone. But some handles are\r\nmade of wood.\'\r\n\r\n7. \'May I look at that knife near you, auntie? I mean the clean one.\r\nThank you!\'\r\n\r\n8. Then Dora wanted one to look at too; and they felt the edges softly\r\nand found them very sharp. They looked at the blunt backs of the blades,\r\nand then tried to read the maker\'s name.\r\n\r\n9. \'There is no room to put the maker\'s name on a needle,\' said Harry.\r\n\'But how do they get it on here?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is stamped on when the blade is red-hot and rather soft.\'\r\n\r\n10. They could not make out how the handle was put on, so their aunt\r\nwent to the knife-box and got out an old knife that had lost its handle.\r\nThey saw that the blade had a long thin piece of iron at the end of it.\r\n\r\n11. \'A long hole is made inside the handle, and this iron thing is put\r\ninto it, and made fast.\'\r\n\r\nSo their uncle said, and then looked at the clock and saw that it was\r\ntime for him to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Setting out for the Farm.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    bas\xc2\xb4-ket\r\n    fetch\r\n    friends\r\n    fowls\r\n    watch\r\n    thought\r\n    charge\r\n    pair\r\n    ban\xc2\xb4-tams\r\n    know\r\n    proud\r\n    peck\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    greed\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    gray\r\n    swal\xc2\xb4-lowed\r\n    laughed\r\n\r\n1. The day after Dora and Harry came home, their mother gave them a\r\nbasket and sent them up to the farm to fetch eggs.\r\n\r\n2. Rover went with them, and all three were glad to go, for they had\r\nmany friends at the farm.\r\n\r\n3. There was the great dog, Watch, and there were the cart-horses and\r\nthe pony, the ducks and the fowls. And there were five girls and\r\nboys--Mary, Tom, Johnny, Annie, and Kate.\r\n\r\n4. When these five, and Watch, saw Harry, Dora, and Rover coming, they\r\nran down the lane to meet them. They were soon all in the farm-yard,\r\ntalking as fast as they could talk.\r\n\r\n5. Two had to tell about their visit to Needle-town, and five about the\r\ndoings at the farm, so it was some time before the eggs were thought of.\r\n\r\n6. Mary had charge of the eggs, and went every morning to look for new\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\'Since you went away,\' she said, \'I have had a pair of bantams given me,\r\nfor my very own. Here they are!\'\r\n\r\n\'What little things! and how very pretty!\' cried Dora. \'Do they know\r\nyou, Mary?\'\r\n\r\n7. \'Yes; I feed them every day. Here comes the big black hen. She has\r\nbeen laying an egg. See how proud she is! She calls out in that way to\r\nlet the rest know what she has done.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'Now she is pecking about for food,\' said Harry.\r\n\r\nTom said that fowls were always eating.\r\n\r\n\'They are greedy things,\' said Kate.\r\n\r\n9. \'Oh, look at this gray hen!\' said Harry, \'she picked up a bit of\r\nstone just now and ate it! Does she know no better?\'\r\n\r\n10. \'It is not for food,\' Mary told him; \'she takes it to grind up the\r\nhard seeds she has swallowed. They all go into a strong little bag, and\r\nthe stones rub and press on the seeds.\'\r\n\r\n11. \'I never heard of such a thing! She keeps a mill inside to grind her\r\nfood!\'\r\n\r\n12. The others laughed, and then Mary went in to get some eggs. After\r\nthe basket was filled, the two children said good-bye to their friends,\r\nand went home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPARROW.\r\n\r\n\r\n    shoots\r\n    spar\xc2\xb4-rows\r\n    steal\r\n    fruit\r\n    thou\xc2\xb4-sand\r\n    ba\xc2\xb4-bies\r\n    build\r\n    spoil\r\n    beaks\r\n    ap\xc2\xb4-ple\r\n    blos\xc2\xb4-som\r\n    fruit\r\n    clean\r\n    thirst\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    wheat\r\n    throw\r\n\r\n1. \'Mother,\' cried Harry, running in one day, \'Jack Denny says he shoots\r\nsparrows!\'\r\n\r\n\'I am very sorry to hear it. Why does he shoot them?\'\r\n\r\n\'"They steal fruit and corn," he says. He wanted me to throw stones at\r\nthem!\'\r\n\r\n2. \'Well, you can tell him about some silly men who killed the sparrows\r\nand other birds, and the next year their fruit and corn were eaten up by\r\ngrubs. Even the leaves on the trees were eaten.\'\r\n\r\n3. \'Is this true?\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite true. They had to send for little birds from other places to live\r\nin their fields and gardens. Do you know that a sparrow kills four\r\nthousand grubs in one day when her babies are in the nest?\r\n\r\n4. \'One wise man who grows fruit says that his best friends are the\r\nsparrows, and he makes holes in the garden-walls for them to build in.\r\nTheir sharp eyes see the tiny things that would spoil the fruit, and\r\ntheir sharp beaks nip them up at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n5. \'He loves to see sparrows in an apple-tree in blossom-time; he knows\r\nthey are saving the apples for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'But Jack says he has seen them pecking at fruit.\'\r\n\r\n6. \'Yes, they like fruit, just as you and I do. But there would be no\r\nfruit at all, if the birds did not eat the grubs.\r\n\r\n7. \'The man I was telling you about puts nets over his trees when the\r\nfruit begins to ripen. And I heard only the other day that it is a good\r\nplan to put pans of clean fresh water close to the trees and bushes.\r\nThen the birds will not go so often to the fruit. They are thirsty and\r\nhot, poor things!\r\n\r\n8. \'And there would be no corn, if the birds did not kill the\r\nwheat-fly\'s grubs.\'\r\n\r\n9. When Harry heard all this, he made up his mind not to throw stones at\r\nthe sparrows, as Jack wanted him to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DAY IN THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    but\xc2\xb4-ter-flies\r\n    mer\xc2\xb4-ry\r\n    gath\xc2\xb4-ered\r\n    broth\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    flow\xc2\xb4-ers\r\n    o-bliged\xc2\xb4\r\n    roamed\r\n    scoured\r\n    pleas\xc2\xb4-ant\r\n    cheese\r\n    hedge\r\n    ease\r\n    brook\xc2\xb4-let\r\n    crys\xc2\xb4-tal\r\n    thrush\r\n    mus\xc2\xb4-ic\r\n\r\n    1.

They have roamed the meadow,\r\n          They have scoured the wood,\r\n        Seeking nuts and blackberries,\r\n          For their pleasant food.\r\n        With their nuts and blackberries\r\n          And bits of bread and cheese,\r\n        On a mossy hedge-bank,\r\n          Now they take their ease.\r\n\r\n    4.  Drinking from the brooklet\r\n          \'Neath the hawthorn tree,\r\n        Clear it runs as crystal,\r\n          Fresh and bright and free.\r\n        And the thrush sings loudly\r\n          On the hawthorn spray,\r\n        And the brooklet ever\r\n          Makes music on its way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME HERBS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    stream\r\n    through\r\n    grav\xc2\xb4-el\r\n    mar\xc2\xb4-ket\r\n    tea\r\n    lett\xc2\xb4-uce\r\n    tongue\r\n    mus\xc2\xb4-tard\r\n    pow\xc2\xb4-der\r\n    sprin\xc2\xb4-kled\r\n    flan\xc2\xb4-nel\r\n    car\xc2\xb4-ried\r\n    pars\xc2\xb4-ley\r\n    thyme\r\n    herbs\r\n    sage\r\n\r\n1. A little stream ran through one of the farmer\'s fields. The water was\r\nso clear that you could see the sand and gravel at the bottom, and in it\r\nthere grew plenty of water-cress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water-cress.]\r\n\r\n2. Harry went one afternoon to help Johnny and Tom to pick it for\r\nmarket, and brought a big bunch home for tea.\r\n\r\n3. His mother had picked a lettuce from the garden, and some mustard and\r\ncress, and they were all put on one plate.\r\n\r\n\'They bite my tongue,\' said Dora, \'all but the lettuce. I like it best.\'\r\n\r\n4. \'And I like the biting,\' said Harry. \'Why is this called mustard,\r\nmother?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because the yellow mustard comes from it. The seeds are ground to\r\npowder.\'\r\n\r\n\'And we eat the leaves. It is a useful plant.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lettuce.]\r\n\r\n5. After tea, mother took some cress-seed and mustard-seed out of two\r\nlittle packets. Then she cut up one or two corks, put them into a deep\r\nplate, filled it with water, and sprinkled seed on the cork.\r\n\r\n6. \'This is for you, Harry,\' she said. \'You will soon have a little crop\r\nof mustard and cress. And here is one for Dora!\'\r\n\r\nIn Dora\'s plate she laid a bit of flannel, poured water on it, and sowed\r\nseed. The children carried off their plates to a safe place, and thought\r\nit would be fine fun to see roots and leaves come out of the tiny seeds.\r\n\r\n7. Then mother called them into the garden to see her parsley. She told\r\nthem that hares and rabbits would come a long way to feed on a\r\nparsley-bed if they could get at it.\r\n\r\n8. Close by grew mint, sage, and thyme. \'All these are herbs,\' she said.\r\n\'They are not like trees, are they?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; they have no bark, no hard wood, and they are so small.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leaves of Mint, Parsley, Thyme, and Sage.]\r\n\r\n9. Dora picked a mint-leaf, a parsley-leaf, a thyme-leaf, and a\r\nsage-leaf, and laid them side by side. She wanted to see if they were\r\nlike each other. But when she looked at them she found that they were\r\nnot alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    cof\xc2\xb4-fee\r\n    beans\r\n    kneel\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    chair\r\n    win\xc2\xb4-dow\r\n    bus\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    stock\xc2\xb4-ings\r\n    ket\xc2\xb4-tle\r\n    rat\xc2\xb4-tled\r\n    coun\xc2\xb4-try\r\n    cher\xc2\xb4-ry\r\n    to-geth\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    blos\xc2\xb4-som\r\n    cov\xc2\xb4-ered\r\n    cloths\r\n    ber\xc2\xb4-ries\r\n\r\n1. \'What is coffee, mother dear? Does it grow?\'\r\n\r\n2. It was Dora who asked this. She and Harry were putting away some\r\nthings that had come from the shop, and she was now filling a tin with\r\ncoffee-beans.\r\n\r\n3. She was kneeling on a chair by the table in the window. Her mother\r\nwas busy mending stockings, and the cat and the dog were both asleep.\r\nThe kettle was singing, and all was cosy.\r\n\r\n4. The coffee-beans rattled into the tin, and Dora picked one out and\r\nlooked at it.\r\n\r\nWhen Harry heard Dora asking about it, he also put his hand in and took\r\na coffee-bean. It smelt very nice, he thought. So did Dora.\r\n\r\n5. They found that it had a flat side and a round side.\r\n\r\n\'It humps up,\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n\'See, I can put the flat side of mine against the flat side of yours,\'\r\nsaid Harry.\r\n\r\n\'They grew like that,\' said mother.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, then, they did grow? They were alive once?\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coffee branch with Berries.]\r\n\r\n6. \'Yes; they were seeds of a plant that grows in a warm country, far\r\naway from here. They once lived inside a berry.\r\n\r\n\'The berry was red like a cherry, and the seeds inside were held\r\ntogether in a little bag.\'\r\n\r\n7. \'There must have been a flower before the berry came,\' said Harry,\r\nthinking of the pea-flower and its pod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coffee-flower.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Berry.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Seeds in Berry.]\r\n\r\n\'A very pretty white flower,\' said his mother. \'They say that a\r\ncoffee-garden looks lovely in blossom-time, just as if it were all\r\ncovered with snow.\r\n\r\n8. \'In two or three days the snow-like blossoms are gone, and the fruit\r\nis left. When it is ripe, men put cloths under the trees, and shake it\r\ndown.\'\r\n\r\n9. \'I wish I could go and help!\' said Harry. \'What comes next?\'\r\n\r\n\'They pick up the berries, dry them in the sun, and get the beans out.\r\nThen they send the beans over the sea in a ship. And here they are!\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dora and Harry tearing up the old papers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    un-hap\xc2\xb4-py\r\n    should\r\n    tea\r\n    heels\r\n    per-haps\xc2\xb4\r\n    clean\r\n    school\r\n    clean\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    hearth\r\n    laugh\r\n    jok\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    in-deed\xc2\xb4\r\n    tear\r\n    boil\r\n    through\r\n    clev\xc2\xb4-er\r\n\r\n1. \'It is such a wet day, I don\'t know what to do!\' said Harry, looking\r\nvery unhappy.\r\n\r\n2. \'Are you tired of your drawing and painting?\' asked his mother.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes! And we have played at houses, and had the bricks out on the\r\nfloor, and now there is nothing to do, and it is not nearly tea-time\r\nyet. Will you read to us, mother?\'\r\n\r\n3. \'Not just now. But if you would help me a little I should get on\r\nfaster, and then we might have a nice time before tea.\'\r\n\r\n\'Jolly!\' cried Harry; and he ran to the foot of the stairs and called\r\nDora.\r\n\r\n4. Down came Dora very fast, with her doll in her arms, and the dog at\r\nher heels.\r\n\r\n5. \'What I want you to do,\' said mother, \'is to tear up these old papers\r\nand put them into this sack. The man is coming soon to take it to the\r\npaper-mill.\'\r\n\r\n6. \'Why is it taken to the paper-mill?\' asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\'To be made over again into paper. Perhaps it will come back to us some\r\nday, all clean.\r\n\r\n7. \'Or it may be made into a newspaper, and father may bring it home in\r\nhis pocket.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or we may get it in copy-books at school.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; or it may come from the shop with rice in it.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'It may never come at all,\' said Dora. \'Perhaps it will go to some\r\nother house.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is quite likely,\' said mother, who was now cleaning the hearth.\r\n\r\n9. They went on putting the paper into the sack for a long time, and\r\nthen Harry asked:\r\n\r\n\'How was paper made before there was old paper to make it of?\'\r\n\r\n10. \'Oh, it is not made of paper only. It is made of old rags, old\r\nropes\'----\r\n\r\nHarry and Dora began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\'And straw, and wood, and a kind of grass\'----\r\n\r\n\'Now, are you joking, mother?\'\r\n\r\n11. \'No, indeed! They cut the wood and straw into tiny bits, and they\r\ncut and tear the rags and boil them.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what do they do with the grass?\'\r\n\r\n\'They cut it up, boil it, and mix clay with it. Then it is put through a\r\nvery clever machine, which makes it into paper.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FLY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n    spilt\r\n    won\xc2\xb4-der\r\n    e-nough\xc2\xb4\r\n    fel\xc2\xb4-low\r\n    thirst\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    mouth\r\n    su\xc2\xb4-gar\r\n    teeth\r\n    ceil\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    ei\xc2\xb4-ther\r\n    win\xc2\xb4-dow\r\n    pane\r\n    won\xc2\xb4-der-ful\r\n    straight\r\n    count\xc2\xb4-ed\r\n    friend\r\n\r\n1. \'Just look here, Harry!\' Dora called out.\r\n\r\nA little milk had been spilt on the table, and two flies had found it\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\'We won\'t wipe it up! Let us wait and see if they can take it all. See,\r\nit is getting less! I wonder how they do it.\'\r\n\r\n2. \'There! one fly has gone. He has had enough. But this old fellow is\r\nvery thirsty. He does not look as if he were drinking, and yet the milk\r\ngoes. That long thing must be his mouth. Is it, mother?\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Enlarged view of Head of Fly showing Trunk.]\r\n\r\n3. \'It is called his trunk. The mouth is at the end of it. He is very\r\nclever with it. Do you know that he never eats? He only drinks.\'\r\n\r\n4. \'But I have seen him eating sugar.\'\r\n\r\n\'No; I don\'t think you have. He has no teeth and no jaws. He can\'t bite\r\nanything. What he does is to wet the sugar with his mouth and melt it,\r\nand then suck it up.\'\r\n\r\n5. \'Well, that is clever! I wonder how he found out how to do it. And I\r\nknow something else that he is clever at.\'\r\n\r\n6. \'What is it, Harry?\' asked Dora.\r\n\r\n\'Something you can\'t do! He can walk on the ceiling.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t do it either,\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n\'How does he hold on, mother? We can see one up there now! He walks\r\nabout as if he were on the table.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Enlarged view of Fly\'s Foot.]\r\n\r\n7. \'He has something like gum inside his feet, and, when he wants to\r\nstand or walk upside down, he presses this out, and it helps him to\r\nstick on. Here is another fly walking up the window-pane.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have often seen flies on the window-pane.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'How wonderful it is! The glass, you see, is smooth and hard, and it\r\nstands straight up. We could not go up a hill like that, could we?\'\r\n\r\n9. They watched him go up and down, counted his six legs, and saw that\r\nhis wings were very pretty. Their mother told them a very strange thing,\r\nthat his eyes could see all ways at once!\r\n\r\n10. Then they had to say good-bye to him, for out he went into the\r\ngarden. When they turned to the table, they found that their other\r\nfriend had gone too--and so had the milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WASP.\r\n\r\n\r\n    wasp\r\n    bus\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    win\xc2\xb4-ter\r\n    ground\r\n    pass\xc2\xb4-age\r\n    loose\r\n    per-haps\xc2\xb4\r\n    fence\r\n    pow\xc2\xb4-der\r\n    spread\r\n    brown\r\n    comb\r\n    pil\xc2\xb4-lars\r\n    cell\r\n    hatched\r\n    crawl\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n\r\n1. There was a great stir at dinner one day. A wasp came in, begging for\r\nsugar and plum-tart. Harry and Dora ran this way and that.\r\n\r\n2. At last their father got the wasp out into the garden, and, when all\r\nwas quiet again, he asked if they would like to hear its story.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, father!\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n3. Harry was busy with his plums, but he nodded, as much as to say, \'I\r\nshall be glad to hear it too!\'\r\n\r\n4. So the father began:\r\n\r\n\'All last winter the wasp was asleep, but when spring came she waked up\r\nand set out to look for a home. I am not quite sure where she found it,\r\nbut it was in the ground, I think.\r\n\r\n5. \'She began to dig in the soft earth, and she dug on till she had made\r\na long passage. She had to carry out all the loose earth herself. Then\r\nshe made a little room at the end of the passage.\r\n\r\n6. \'Next she looked about for some old wood, and found it in a tree,\r\nperhaps, or post, or bit of fence. She rubbed away at it with her jaws\r\ntill she got some of it off in powder.\r\n\r\n7. \'She made this powder into a paste with a sort of gum which came out\r\nof her mouth, and off she went with it to her room.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'What did she do with it?\'\r\n\r\n\'She spread it out in sheets of thin brown paper, and with these she\r\nmade a comb like a bee\'s.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wasp\'s Nest.]\r\n\r\n\'She made paper of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Only a bee\'s is made of wax. I know that!\' said Harry.\r\n\r\n9. \'She put many layers of paper on the top to keep the rain out, and\r\npillars under it to hold it up. Then she laid an egg in each cell. When\r\nthe eggs were hatched\'----\r\n\r\n\'Little wasps came flying out,\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n\'No; little grubs came crawling out!\r\n\r\n10. \'The wasp was now more busy than ever. She fed each baby in turn,\r\nand as they all grew bigger she had to get more and more food for them.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUNFLOWER\r\n\r\n\r\n    blue\r\n    buzz\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    set\xc2\xb4-tled\r\n    watched\r\n    sun\xc2\xb4-flow-er\r\n    course\r\n    warmth\r\n    in-stead\xc2\xb4\r\n    star\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    spar-row\r\n    stopped\r\n    crowd\r\n    cush\xc2\xb4-ion\r\n    mid\xc2\xb4-dle\r\n    gar\xc2\xb4-den\r\n    know\r\n\r\n1. It was very hot, the sky was blue, and the air was full of the\r\nhumming and buzzing of bees and flies. A white butterfly flitted by, but\r\nsoon went away over the garden-wall.\r\n\r\n2. Bee after bee, and fly after fly, settled on the sunflowers and\r\nhunted for honey. Dora and Harry watched for a long time.\r\n\r\n3. \'The sunflower is like a little sun,\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n\'And it loves the sun,\' said her mother, who was snipping off dead roses\r\nclose by; \'it always turns to look at it. See, its face is towards the\r\nsun now. And if you look again before sunset you will find the flower\r\nturned to it still.\'\r\n\r\n4. \'How strange!\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sunflower.]\r\n\r\n\'And it has such a strong stalk,\' said Harry. \'You would not think that\r\nit could turn round.

Why are\r\nthere so many holes in the leaves?\'\r\n\r\n6. \'Grubs have been eating them. Our friend Mr Sparrow must have been\r\naway lately!\'\r\n\r\n7. Here mother stopped snipping at her rose-trees, and came up to one of\r\nthe sunflowers.\r\n\r\n8. \'There is something I want you to see,\' she said. \'You think this is\r\none big flower, but it is really a crowd of little flowers. Look! Can\r\nyou think of another flower that is something like it?\'\r\n\r\n9. Harry and Dora shook their heads.\r\n\r\n\'It is very small,\' mother went on, \'with a cushion in the middle like\r\nthis, and rays standing out all round like these.\'\r\n\r\n10. \'Does it grow on a tree?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'In this garden?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'In the fields?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I know!\' cried Harry. \'It is the daisy.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMERRY WORKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    wheels\r\n    bus\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    i\xc2\xb4-dle\r\n    brook\xc2\xb4-lets\r\n    ripp\xc2\xb4-ling\r\n    sky\xc2\xb4-lark\r\n    lis\xc2\xb4-ten\r\n    hon\xc2\xb4-ey\r\n    mer\xc2\xb4-ri-ly\r\n    hum\xc2\xb4-ming\r\n    e-nough\xc2\xb4\r\n    wea\xc2\xb4-ry\r\n\r\n    1.

Mother went back to her roses, and soon called for a little basket,\r\nsaying that Dora and Harry should take a few to an old woman who lived\r\nin the village.\r\n\r\n2. \'Poor granny,\' she said, \'is so fond of roses, and she can never get\r\nout now to see them. Which shall we pick for her?\'\r\n\r\n3. \'Some of these white ones,\' said Dora.\r\n\r\n\'I think she would like these red ones,\' said Harry, \'they smell so\r\nsweetly.\'\r\n\r\n4. Mother cut one or two of each, and then a moss-rose, which looked as\r\nif it had moss growing round it, and then a pink cabbage-rose.\r\n\r\n5. \'What has it to do with cabbage?\' asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\'It is only called cabbage because it is so big and round.\'\r\n\r\n6. \'I like it the best of all,\' said Dora, and stooped to smell it,\r\nputting her nose far down into the sweet, deep cup: \'it is such a nice\r\nrose!\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wild Rose.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden Rose.]\r\n\r\n7. \'Yes, I am very fond of it, and of all roses,\' said mother, looking\r\nat her bushes with a smile, \'but I almost think I like the wild ones\r\nbest. Do you know that the wild rose is the mother of all these? Once\r\nupon a time all roses were wild.\'\r\n\r\n8. Harry and Dora did not think that wild roses were very like garden\r\nroses. \'But they both have thorns,\' they said.\r\n\r\n9. \'Look at them as you go along. There are some bushes not far from the\r\nbottom of the lane, after you turn round to go to the village. I don\'t\r\nthink you will find many roses left, but you will see their fruit. They\r\nare the birds\' fruit-trees.\'\r\n\r\n10. \'What can mother mean?\' they asked as they went along.\r\n\r\nBut they soon found out. The bushes were covered with hips; some green,\r\nothers yellow, one or two quite red.\r\n\r\n11. They agreed to leave them for the birds. Dora said \'They would be\r\nsure to want them in the winter.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making the Doll\'s House.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    min\xc2\xb4-er-al\r\n    cop\xc2\xb4-per\r\n    zinc\r\n    chalk\r\n    gummed\r\n    climbed\r\n    knees\r\n    eve\xc2\xb4-nings\r\n    tools\r\n    dead\r\n    thought\r\n    oak\r\n    beech\r\n    birch\r\n    wil\xc2\xb4-low\r\n    build\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n\r\n1. The little mineral box was made, and Harry and Dora put in the lumps\r\nof lead, iron, copper, tin, zinc, chalk, and slate. Father wrote the\r\nnames on tiny slips of paper and gummed them on.\r\n\r\n2. Then he said that he was going to make Dora a doll\'s house. On\r\nhearing this, Dora first jumped about for joy, and then climbed up on\r\nher father\'s knees to kiss and hug him.\r\n\r\n3. The doll\'s house was not made all at once. It had to be done bit by\r\nbit in the evenings after father had come home from work and had his\r\ntea.\r\n\r\n4. Dora and Harry always helped him, or stood by and talked, played with\r\nbits of wood, and turned over the tools in the box.\r\n\r\n5. They said that saw-dust should be called wood-dust; and they found\r\nout that wood was called tree when it was alive, and tree was called\r\nwood when it was dead. They thought this very funny.\r\n\r\n6. They also learned that there were as many kinds of wood as there were\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\'Some wood is hard,\' said their father, \'some is half-hard, and some is\r\nsoft.\'\r\n\r\n\'Soft wood!\' cried Dora.\r\n\r\n7. \'Well, not soft like butter! But softer than oak, beech, birch, and\r\nelm\'----\r\n\r\n\'The trunk of an oak-tree is lying where the rabbits live,\' said Harry,\r\nin a great hurry. \'We often play on it. I know that it is hard. What\r\nsort of wood are you making the doll\'s house of?\'\r\n\r\n8. \'Soft wood. It is a bit of pine. So is the box that holds the\r\nminerals. I should find it hard work to cut oak.\r\n\r\n\'Now, there is one kind of wood so soft that you can bend it. It is\r\ncalled willow, and baskets are made of it.\r\n\r\n\'But oak was once used in building the great strong ships.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL.\r\n\r\nPART 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n    win\xc2\xb4-dow\r\n    shov\xc2\xb4-el\r\n    spade\r\n    coal\r\n    tum\xc2\xb4-bled\r\n    con-tent\xc2\xb4\r\n    won\xc2\xb4-der-ing\r\n    earth\r\n    cage\r\n    stretch\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    en\xc2\xb4-gine\r\n    doz\xc2\xb4-en\r\n\r\n1. \'Here comes the coal,\' said Harry, looking out of the window.\r\n\'Mother, may we help Jim to get it in? I can have the big shovel, and\r\nDora the little one. I should like to see the cart upset! What fun it\r\nwill be!\'\r\n\r\n2. Crash came the coal on the ground. Then the coal-man drew his horse\r\nand cart away, and set to work with a spade to fill the little\r\ncoal-place.\r\n\r\n3. The dog jumped, and got in every one\'s way. He wanted to help, too,\r\nbut did not know how. Dora tumbled over the heap and bumped her head, so\r\nshe thought she would be content with watching Jim and Harry. But Harry\r\nwas soon tired, and Jim was left to go on alone.\r\n\r\n4. \'Where does coal come from, Jim?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Out of the ground, my lad.\'\r\n\r\n\'Does it? Do you dig for it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t. But I know somebody who does.\'\r\n\r\n5. \'If I were to dig for it, should I find any, Jim?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not you! Why, you have to go down ever such a long way before you can\r\neven begin to dig.\'\r\n\r\n6. \'How do you get down?\'\r\n\r\n\'You go down in a thing they call a cage. You can\'t walk down, you know.\r\nIt is like going down a deep pit. They call it a mine.\'\r\n\r\n7. \'Oh, I have heard of coal-mines!\'\r\n\r\nDora was taking up one little lump of coal after another, and wondering\r\nwhy it was so shiny if it had really come out of the earth.\r\n\r\n8. Harry went on. \'How do they let the cage down? Have you ever been\r\ndown?\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coal-miners going down to work.]\r\n\r\n\'I have been down once,\' said Jim, stopping in his work and stretching\r\nhimself. \'This is the way. There is an engine at the top of the\r\nshaft\'----\r\n\r\n\'What is the shaft?\'\r\n\r\n9. \'The pit I told you about. The engine is fixed there and it lets\r\ndown the cage and pulls it up again. Half-a-dozen men or so can go in it\r\nat a time.\'\r\n\r\n\'It must be very strong.\'\r\n\r\n10. \'Yes, it is, and it has strong chains to hold it. It goes up and\r\ndown all day long, bringing up the coal.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL.\r\n\r\nPART 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n    re\xc2\xb4-al-ly\r\n    eas\xc2\xb4-i-ly\r\n    slic\xc2\xb4-es\r\n    straight\r\n    knife\r\n    be-tween\xc2\xb4\r\n    met\xc2\xb4-al\r\n    fetched\r\n    pic\xc2\xb4-tures\r\n    an\xc2\xb4-i-mal\r\n    whole\r\n    for\xc2\xb4-ests\r\n    thou\xc2\xb4-sands\r\n    piec\xc2\xb4-es\r\n    to-geth\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    puz\xc2\xb4-zles\r\n\r\n1. Next day the children asked their mother to tell them what coal\r\nreally was. Harry did not think it was a stone, because he had broken\r\ntwo or three lumps with a hammer. He found that it broke much more\r\neasily than stone.\r\n\r\n2. Besides, it did not fly all into sharp bits, but came off in slices;\r\nand he saw that it had straight lines along it. When he poked his knife\r\nin between these lines, he could take off a slice of coal at once!\r\n\r\n3. Dora did not think it was a metal, because she had learnt that iron\r\nwould melt in a fire and flow like water. \'Coal does not melt,\' she\r\nsaid, \'every one knows that!\'\r\n\r\n4. She took a small lump out of the coal-box, and Harry did the same.\r\nMother then fetched some pictures, and one or two other things, and the\r\ntalk began.\r\n\r\n5. \'It is no wonder that you can\'t guess what coal is! It does not look\r\nat all like what it was at first. It was not always in the ground; it\r\nused to live on the top and get the air and sunshine.\'\r\n\r\n6. \'It must have been alive,\' said Harry. \'Was it an animal?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then it was a plant!\' cried Dora.\r\n\r\n7. \'Well, it is all that is left of many plants and trees, whole forests\r\nof plants and trees, that grew long, long ago.\'\r\n\r\n\'Before you were born, mother?\'\r\n\r\n8. \'Yes, long before that! It was hundreds and thousands of years ago.\r\nIt was so far back that the trees were not like the trees we have now.\r\nMany of them were big ferns. Think of a fern grown up to be a tree! And\r\nmany were great horse-tails. You know what a horse-tail is?\'\r\n\r\n9. \'Oh yes,\' said Dora, \'we find them in the ditch down the lane. It is\r\nsuch fun pulling them to pieces and putting them together again--like\r\npuzzles!\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Horse-tail.]\r\n\r\n10. \'Those trees must have been very strange,\' said Harry. \'They would\r\nnot be nice to climb. But there were no boys in those days, so it did\r\nnot matter.\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    min\xc2\xb4-er-al\r\n    coal\r\n    fen\xc2\xb4-der\r\n    prop\xc2\xb4-er\r\n    walk\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    laugh\xc2\xb4-ing\r\n    grate\r\n    cru\xc2\xb4-el\r\n    Lon\xc2\xb4-don\r\n    smoke\r\n    al-read\xc2\xb4-y\r\n    flame\r\n    blaze\r\n    beast\r\n    cage\r\n    pic\xc2\xb4-tures\r\n\r\n1. \'Don\'t you think,\' said Harry, \'that a bit of coal would be a good\r\nthing for our mineral box?\'\r\n\r\n2. \'I do,\' said his father. \'Get a little lump, and put it in. And, by\r\nthe way, we want more coal on the fire. I must get some.\'\r\n\r\n3. \'How nice a fire is on a cold day!\' said Dora, sitting down on the\r\nfender, to be as near to it as she could.\r\n\r\n\'Very nice,\' said her mother, \'in its proper place--in the grate.\'\r\n\r\n4. \'Ah, we should not like it to come walking about the room!\' said\r\nHarry, laughing. \'There would soon be no room\'----\r\n\r\n\'And no house!\' said Dora, shaking her head. \'And then what should we\r\ndo?\'\r\n\r\n5. Father came back with the coal, and put some into the grate, saying:\r\n\r\n\'Fire is a good servant but a bad master. If it gets its own way it is a\r\ncruel thing. It would burn a town down. It once burned big London.\'\r\n\r\n6. Harry was looking at one of the lumps that had been put on the fire.\r\nSmoke was coming out of it already. A flame burst out in front, and soon\r\nthe whole lump was in a blaze.\r\n\r\n7. \'It seems such a pity that it should all be burned up,\' said Harry,\r\n\'when it took so long to make.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is the way of fire,\' said father, \'it eats up everything, and when\r\nit has nothing more to feed on it comes to an end--it goes out, we say.\'\r\n\r\n8. \'We don\'t want it to go out, and so we keep on feeding it,\' said\r\nmother. \'It is like a wild beast in a cage.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now look at the coal!\' said father.\r\n\r\n9. By this time the lumps were red and very hot. The children went down\r\non their knees to look for pictures in the fire. They soon saw what\r\nlooked like men and dogs, rocks, hills, and trees, and at last a great\r\ncat with red-hot eyes and a very curly tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECT LESSONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAT.                      [_Page 7._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The cat lives in and about our homes; so we call it a domestic\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n2. It belongs to the same tribe of animals as the lion and tiger. They\r\nare savage--puss is tame. Like them, it is a beast of prey--that is, it\r\ncatches and eats other animals. They cannot hear it coming with its\r\nsoft, padded feet.\r\n\r\n3. The cat leaps upon its prey. It sticks its strong, sharp claws into a\r\nmouse, and soon kills it with its sharp teeth.\r\n\r\n4. Puss is covered with fur; she has five claws on each fore-paw, and\r\nfour on each hind one. She draws them into little sheaths when not\r\nangry.\r\n\r\n5. With its rough tongue the cat can lap up milk, and also clean its\r\nfur. It likes to be clean. It opens its eyes wider in the dark, and can\r\nsee to run about at night. On each side of its head are long whiskers,\r\nwith which it feels its way.\r\n\r\n_Write and learn:_\r\n\r\nCats have--\r\n    Padded feet.\r\n    Sharp claws and teeth.\r\n    Rough tongues.\r\n    Good sight at night.\r\n\r\nCats like--\r\n    Milk.\r\n    Meat.\r\n    Mice and rats.\r\n    Birds and fish.\r\n\r\nCats are--\r\n    Domestic.\r\n    Tame.\r\n    Useful.\r\n    Cleanly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOG.                      [_Page 12._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The dog is larger and more active than the cat. It is also of more\r\nuse to man, for it guards the house, minds the sheep, and will not allow\r\nany one to harm its master.\r\n\r\n2. There are many kinds of dogs. All are of some use--from the large\r\nNewfoundland dog to the little fox-terrier.\r\n\r\n3. Dogs are like cats in some things. They have padded feet and strong\r\nclaws. But their claws are blunt. They cannot draw them into sheaths as\r\npuss does; so they make more noise in walking.\r\n\r\n4. The dog is also a beast of prey. But it is not so fierce as the wolf\r\nor the fox, which belong to the same tribe of animals. It likes meat and\r\nbones, but will also eat bread and vegetables. Its teeth are very strong\r\nand sharp.\r\n\r\n5.

The flowers are something like a cup in shape, with a little tuft of\r\ngrass-like threads standing in each one. In the green ball in the middle\r\nthere are tiny seeds from which other buttercups will grow if they fall\r\ninto the ground.\r\n\r\n3. Buttercups come in spring.

Ruts are made in the soil by a plough, and into these the seed is\r\ncast. Then the soil is covered over them by a harrow, drawn by a horse.\r\n\r\n3. Rain and warm sunshine help the grains to grow. They grow into tall,\r\njointed stems, and soon the ears of wheat appear. They are green at\r\nfirst, but the sun ripens them and turns them yellow.\r\n\r\n4. Then the wheat is cut, and the new grains are threshed out from the\r\nhusks which are called chaff. The tall stems make straw. The grains are\r\nground into flour by the miller. We use flour for making bread, cakes,\r\nand puddings.\r\n\r\n_Write and learn:_\r\n\r\nWheat is--\r\n    A grass plant.\r\n    Grown from seed.\r\n    Green at first.\r\n    Yellow when ripe.\r\n\r\nWheat has--\r\n    A tall stem.\r\n    Graceful leaves.\r\n    An ear.\r\n    Grains.\r\n\r\nWheat makes--\r\n    Flour.\r\n    Foods.\r\n    Chaff.\r\n    Straw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLATE.

It is got out in very large blocks. Sometimes gunpowder\r\nis used to crack the rocks before the blocks can be got out.\r\n\r\n2. Slate is very hard and brittle. It is used for many purposes.

The mouse gnaws through the walls and floors of our houses with its\r\nsharp, strong teeth. It makes a little nest in a hole.

The tiny harvest-mouse makes its\r\nnest on a wheat-stalk. It often does great harm to the wheat.\r\n\r\n4.

[_Page 41._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The rabbit is about the size of the cat, and is covered with short\r\nfur. It burrows a hole in the ground and makes a nest there for its\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n2. Rabbits have long ears and large eyes. They can hear a very slight\r\nsound, and can see _behind_ as well as before them.\r\n\r\n3. Their hind-legs are longer than their fore-legs; so they do not run,\r\nbut leap.\r\n\r\n4. Rabbits like to live where there is plenty of furze, which they eat\r\nfor food. They do much mischief in corn-fields by eating the young corn.\r\nThey also eat the bark off young trees, and so spoil them.\r\n\r\n_Write and learn:_\r\n\r\nRabbits have--\r\n    Long ears.\r\n    Large eyes.\r\n    Long hind-legs.\r\n    Warm fur.\r\n\r\nRabbits eat--\r\n    Grass.\r\n    Roots.\r\n    Leaves.\r\n    Bark.\r\n\r\nRabbits--\r\n    Burrow.\r\n    Make nests for their young.\r\n    Leap.\r\n    Play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIVY.                          [_Page 43._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Ivy is an evergreen, climbing plant. It grows on old walls, houses,\r\nand churches, and sometimes on trees.\r\n\r\n2. There are several kinds of ivy. The leaves of each kind are of a\r\ndifferent shape. All ivy leaves are very pretty.\r\n\r\n3. The leaves have little marks called veins, crossing them in all ways.\r\nThese veins are full of sap, or moisture, which the roots of the plant\r\nsuck up from the earth.\r\n\r\n4.

[_Page 53._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The donkey is a useful animal when well treated. It is cheaper to buy\r\nand to keep than a pony.\r\n\r\n2. The donkey has hoofs like the horse, and wears shoes. It is very\r\npatient and gentle, and can do with coarse food.\r\n\r\n3. The donkey\'s coat is rough, and its mane short. It has a black stripe\r\ndown its back and across its shoulders.

Their legs are so slender that their bodies seem almost too large for\r\nthem. The thick wool which grows upon them makes them look large.\r\n\r\n3. Sheep eat grass. They tear it off, as the cow does. They cannot bite,\r\nsince they have no front teeth in the upper jaw.\r\n\r\n4. They are very timid, gentle creatures. They do not like to be alone.\r\nThey live in flocks. They make a great noise when bleating.\r\n\r\n5. Sheep are very useful.

[_Page 59._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Turnips are grown both in fields and gardens. The tops are green. The\r\nturnip is almost round; but it tapers towards the bottom. Most of the\r\nturnip grows under ground; but we can see part of it above ground when\r\nnearly ripe.\r\n\r\n2. Turnips are good for food. Sheep and cattle are fond of them. Animals\r\neat them raw. We boil them. Raw turnips are not good for us. Pigs will\r\neat the rinds which we peel off.\r\n\r\n3.

[_Page 62._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The pea is a climbing plant. We put tall sticks in the garden for the\r\npeas to climb. They grow from seeds which are dried peas.\r\n\r\n2. As they grow, tendrils shoot out and take hold of the sticks. Pretty\r\ngreen leaves grow too. Then come the dainty white flowers.\r\n\r\n3. When the flowers wither, they leave little green pods.

[_Page 67._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Metals are made from ores which are dug out of the earth. These ores\r\nare found in many parts of the world. Iron is the most common, as well\r\nas the most useful metal.\r\n\r\n2. Many things we use are made of it. The _steel_ of which our knives,\r\ntools, and other things are made, is made from iron. Iron is largely\r\nused for making bridges, railings, fire-grates, hammers.\r\n\r\n3. Lead, copper, tin, and zinc are metals also. So are silver and gold.\r\n\r\n4. Men must dig deep down into the earth to find them. The holes and\r\npassages which they make are called mines.\r\n\r\n5. All metals are heavy.

[_Page 71._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Needles are made of steel wire. In a needle-factory there are\r\nhundreds of coils of wire. Some of the wire is thick enough for\r\ndarning-needles; some very thin for making sewing-needles.\r\n\r\n2. The wire is cut by a machine. The needles are pointed on a\r\ngrindstone. The eyes are punched by another machine. Then the needles\r\nare filed to make them smooth.\r\n\r\n3. To make them hard, the needles are made white-hot, and put into cold\r\nwater until quite cool. They are then cleaned and polished.\r\n\r\n4. They must be very dry before put into packets, or they will rust.\r\n\r\n5.

[_Page 80._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A knife is most useful for cutting. The blade is made of steel; the\r\nhandle of ivory, bone, or wood.\r\n\r\n2. The blade and handle are fastened together by a long, thin piece of\r\niron which goes into the handle. The blades have to be heated as needles\r\nare, to make them hard.\r\n\r\n3. A knife is blunt on one edge; sharp on the other. The grinder\r\nsharpens it on a huge stone which goes round and round. The blades are\r\npolished before being put into the handles, as well as after.\r\n\r\n4. There are many kinds of knives. Pocket-knives have a spring to make\r\nthem shut tightly. A table-knife is rounded at the end; the\r\ncarving-knife has a sharp pointed blade.\r\n\r\n_Write and learn:_\r\n\r\nKnives are--\r\n    Sharp.\r\n    Bright.\r\n    Useful.\r\n\r\nKnives have--\r\n    Blades.\r\n    Handles.\r\n    Springs.\r\n\r\nKnives are made--\r\n    In Sheffield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEN.                      [_Page 83._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The hen is a domestic bird. Some are white; some black; others many\r\ncolours. The hen finds much of its own food in the fields. It is fed\r\nwith barley, bread, potatoes, and other things from the house.\r\n\r\n2. The hen has a small head with eyes at the sides. Its bill is strong\r\nand sharp.\r\n\r\n3. The hen sleeps on a perch on one leg. It never falls off; its foot is\r\nmade for grasping.\r\n\r\n4. Hens are useful for the eggs they give us; and they are also good for\r\nfood. Their feathers, too, are useful.\r\n\r\n_Write and learn:_\r\n\r\nThe hen has--\r\n    A small head.\r\n    A strong bill.\r\n    A grasping foot.\r\n\r\nThe hen is--\r\n    A domestic bird.\r\n    A percher.\r\n    Useful.\r\n\r\nThe hen gives us--\r\n    Eggs.\r\n    Food.\r\n    Feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPARROW.                  [_Page 86._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The sparrow is a small bird with brown and gray feathers. It builds\r\nits nest on our houses, and sometimes in the pipes which carry the rain\r\noff the roof. A sparrow\'s nest is seldom found in a tree. It lays five\r\nor six eggs which are spotted with brown.\r\n\r\n2. Farmers often kill sparrows because they steal the corn and fruit.\r\nBut they are really good friends to the farmer. They eat the worms and\r\ngrubs, which would destroy _all_ the fruit.\r\n\r\n3. The sparrow is a very bold little bird, and is to be found in the\r\nstreets of the largest towns as well as in the country.\r\n\r\n_Write and learn:_\r\n\r\nThe sparrow has--\r\n    Brown and gray feathers.\r\n    Sharp claws.\r\n    A long tail.\r\n\r\nThe sparrow is--\r\n    Small.\r\n    Bold.\r\n    Useful.\r\n\r\nThe sparrow eats--\r\n    Grain.\r\n    Worms.\r\n    Fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBS.

We get coffee from the coffee-tree. It is an evergreen, something\r\nlike our bay-tree. It bears a pretty white flower.\r\n\r\n2. When the flower falls it leaves a red berry, something like a\r\ncherry. The two hard, oval seeds inside it are what we call coffee\r\nbeans. They are of a pale colour in the berry, but are roasted to make\r\nthem brown.\r\n\r\n3. Coffee is good to drink, but it is not so cheap as tea.

[_Page 96._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Paper is one of the most useful things we have. It is made of old\r\nrags which are torn to pieces by a machine. Lime is put in to make them\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n2. The pulp, as it is called, is then formed into sheets and pressed. It\r\nis then covered with _size_, and pressed again to make it smooth and\r\nglossy.\r\n\r\n3. Blotting-paper and other kinds not used for writing upon, are not\r\nsized. Brown paper is made of old canvas and sacking.\r\n\r\n4. Before paper was made, people used to write upon the inner bark of\r\ntrees, and the thin skins of animals made sweet and dry, and called\r\nparchment.\r\n\r\n_Write and learn:_\r\n\r\nWriting-paper is--\r\n    Smooth.\r\n    Glossy.\r\n    Fine.\r\n\r\nBlotting-paper is--\r\n    Soft.\r\n    Unglazed.\r\n    Porous.\r\n\r\nBrown paper is--\r\n    Coarse.\r\n    Strong.\r\n    Used for parcels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLY.                      [_Page 99._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The fly is a wonderful little insect. It has six legs, with such\r\ncurious feet that it can walk on the window-panes or the ceiling.\r\n\r\n2. It has a funny little round head. Its eyes stand out so that it can\r\nsee round about it. It cannot move its eyes as we do. Neither can it\r\nbite its food--it sucks it.\r\n\r\n3. The fly teases us in summer. It gets into our sugar, milk, treacle,\r\nand honey. Then it makes marks upon our windows and other things.\r\n\r\n4. Its wings are very pretty. When they get wet it cannot fly.

[_Page 102._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A wasp is a very pretty insect, black and yellow in colour. There are\r\nseveral kinds. Some burrow in the ground and make their nests there.\r\nOthers build their nests in trees.\r\n\r\n2. Wasps live together in large numbers. They are very busy. Some lay\r\neggs; some are masons, and build the nest; others are soldiers, and\r\nguard the home; whilst others carry away all the rubbish, and keep\r\neverything clean and tidy.\r\n\r\n3. The wasp\'s sting has poison in it. This is why it gives us such pain\r\nif we get stung.\r\n\r\n4. The wasp is something like the fly in shape, only much larger.

[_Page 104._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. This flower is called _sun_-flower because it always turns its face\r\nto the sun. It turns as the sun goes round.\r\n\r\n2. The sunflower grows on a strong, tall stalk. It is something like a\r\ndaisy in form.\r\n\r\n3. The deep-yellow leaves stand out in rays from the dark-coloured\r\nmiddle of the flower, which is called the _disk_. This disk is made of a\r\nlarge number of tiny flowers closely packed together.\r\n\r\n4. The seeds of this flower are large and oblong, and contain oil.\r\n\r\n5. Bees and flies visit sunflowers, to gather honey.\r\n\r\n_Write and learn:_\r\n\r\nThe sunflower has--\r\n    A strong stalk.\r\n    A large disk.\r\n    Many rays.\r\n\r\nThe sunflower--\r\n    Grows from seed.\r\n    Contains honey.\r\n    Turns to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe sunflower has--\r\n    Small flowers in its disk.\r\n    Oblong seeds.\r\n    Oily seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROSE.

Roses have thorns on their stems. Wild roses have many thorns. Wild\r\nroses are small--have only five leaves--but they are very pretty.\r\n\r\n3. When they die they leave berries, called hips, which make good food\r\nfor the birds in winter. There are seeds in them.\r\n\r\n_Write and learn:_\r\n\r\nThe rose has--\r\n    A sweet scent.\r\n    Sharp thorns on its stem.\r\n    Soft, smooth leaves.\r\n\r\nThe rose is--\r\n    Sometimes white.\r\n    Sometimes yellow.\r\n    Sometimes red.\r\n\r\nThe wild rose--\r\n    Grows in hedges.\r\n    Has five leaves.\r\n    Has berries called \'hips.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD.                         [_Page 111._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Wood seems to be almost as useful as iron. Hundreds of years ago,\r\nhouses were built of wood. All the houses in London were. There is much\r\nwood in our houses now.\r\n\r\n2. There are many kinds of wood--each comes from a different tree. Oak\r\nis a very hard wood. Pine is softer. Willow is very soft; its thin\r\nbranches will bend easily. It is used for making baskets.\r\n\r\n3. When the trunk of a tree is sawn into planks we can see the grain or\r\nmarks in it. Some are very prettily marked. Oak and walnut are.

[_Page 113._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Coal is dug out of the earth. Coal and iron are found together. But\r\ncoal is not a metal as iron is. It will not melt. We call it a mineral.\r\n\r\n2. It is found in many parts of the world. There is a very large\r\nquantity in our own country.\r\n\r\n3. It is a black, shiny, opaque, and brittle mineral.

Coals were once forests, which sank lower and lower into the earth\r\nhundreds and thousands of years ago. They became mixed with other\r\nthings, and in time were changed to coal. We can see the grain in some\r\nof the coal, as we see it in wood.\r\n\r\n_Write and learn:_\r\n\r\nCoal is--\r\n    A Mineral.\r\n    Black.\r\n    Opaque.\r\n    Brittle.\r\n\r\nCoal is--\r\n    Buried forests.\r\n    Got from mines.\r\n    Heavy.\r\n    Grained.\r\n\r\nCoal is used for--\r\n    Fuel.\r\n    Smelting metals.\r\n    Making gas.\r\n    Making tar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE.

It is so useful that we should not be able to have many things we\r\nhave, if we had no fire.\r\n\r\n3. When England was covered with forests, hundreds of years ago, people\r\nused to have fires of wood, instead of coal.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n'
