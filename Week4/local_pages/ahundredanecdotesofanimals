from some motive of revenge, killed his _cornack_, or\r\nconductor. The man\'s wife, who beheld the dreadful scene, took her two\r\nchildren, and threw them at the feet of the enraged animal, saying, "Since\r\nyou have slain my husband, take my life also, as well as that of my\r\nchildren." The elephant instantly stopped, relented, and as if stung with\r\nremorse, took up the eldest boy with his trunk, placed him on its neck,\r\nadopted him for his _cornack_, and would never afterwards allow any other\r\nperson to mount it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE II.\r\n\r\nThe Newfoundland Dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the magistrates in Harbour Grace, in Newfoundland, had an old dog\r\nof the regular web-footed species peculiar to that island, who was in the\r\nhabit of carrying a lantern before his master at night, as steadily as the\r\nmost attentive servant could do, stopping short when his master made a\r\nstop, and proceeding when he saw him disposed to follow. If his master was\r\nabsent from home, on the lantern being fixed to his mouth, and the command\r\ngiven, "Go fetch thy master," he would immediately set off and proceed\r\ndirectly to the town, which lay at the distance of more than a mile from\r\nthe place of his master\'s residence: he would then stop at the door of\r\nevery house which he knew his master was in the habit of frequenting, and\r\nlaying down his lantern, growl and strike the door, making all the noise\r\nin his power until it was opened; if his master was not there, he would\r\nproceed farther in the same manner, until he had found him. If he had\r\naccompanied him only once into a house, this was sufficient to induce him\r\nto take that house in his round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE III.\r\n\r\nStudying.\r\n\r\n\r\nA magpie, belonging to a barber at Rome, could imitate to a nicety almost\r\nevery word it heard. Some trumpets happened one day to be sounded before\r\nthe shop, and for a day or two afterwards the magpie was quite mute, and\r\nseemed pensive and melancholy. All who knew it were greatly surprised at\r\nits silence; and it was supposed that the sound of the trumpets had so\r\nstunned it, as to deprive it at once of both voice and hearing. It soon\r\nappeared, however, that this was far from being the case; for the bird had\r\nbeen all the time occupied in profound meditation, studying how to imitate\r\nthe sound of the trumpets; and when at last master of it, the magpie, to\r\nthe astonishment of all its friends, suddenly broke its long silence, by a\r\nperfect imitation of the flourish of trumpets it had heard; observing with\r\nthe greatest exactness all the repetitions, stops, and changes. The\r\nacquisition of this lesson had, however, exhausted the whole of the\r\nmagpie\'s stock of intellect; for it made it forget everything it had\r\nlearned before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE IV.\r\n\r\nA Faithful Companion.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gardener, in removing some rubbish, discovered two ground toads of an\r\nuncommon size, weighing no less than seven pounds. On finding them, he was\r\nsurprised to see that one of them got upon the back of the other, and both\r\nproceeded to move slowly on the ground towards a place of retreat; upon\r\nfurther examination he found that the one on the back of the other had\r\nreceived a severe contusion from his spade, and was rendered unable to get\r\naway, without the assistance of its companion!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE V.\r\n\r\nA False Alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago, a soldier doing duty at the castle of Cape Town, kept a\r\ntame baboon for his amusement. One evening it broke its chains unknown to\r\nhim. In the night, climbing up into the belfry, it began to play with, and\r\nring the bell. Immediately the whole place was in an uproar; some great\r\ndanger was apprehended. Many thought that the castle was on fire; others,\r\nthat an enemy had entered the bay, and the soldiers began actually to turn\r\nout, when it was discovered that the baboon had occasioned the\r\ndisturbance. On the following morning a court-martial was held, when Cape\r\njustice dictated, that whereas the baboon had unnecessarily put the castle\r\ninto alarm, the master should receive fifty lashes; the soldier, however,\r\nfound means to evade the punishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE VI.\r\n\r\nSagacious Bruin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe captain of a Greenland whaler being anxious to procure a bear, without\r\nwounding the skin, made trial of the stratagem of laying the noose of a\r\nrope in the snow, and placing a piece of meat within it. A bear ranging\r\nthe neighbouring ice was soon enticed to the spot by the smell of the\r\ndainty morsel. He perceived the bait, approached, and seized it in his\r\nmouth; but his foot at the same time, by a jerk of the rope, being\r\nentangled in the noose, he pushed it off with his paw, and deliberately\r\nretired. After having eaten the piece he had carried away with him, he\r\nreturned. The noose, with another piece of meat, being replaced, he pushed\r\nthe rope aside, and again walked triumphantly off with his capture. A\r\nthird time the noose was laid; but excited to caution by the evident\r\nobservations of the bear, the sailors buried the rope beneath the snow,\r\nand laid the bait in a deep hole dug in the centre. The bear once more\r\napproached, and the sailors were assured of their success. But bruin, more\r\nsagacious than they expected, after snuffing about the place for a few\r\nmoments, scraped the snow away with his paw, threw the rope aside, and\r\nagain escaped unhurt with his prize.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE VII.\r\n\r\nA Strange Mouser.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentleman once had in his possession a hen, which answered the purpose\r\nof a cat in destroying mice. She was constantly seen watching close to a\r\ncorn rick, and the moment a mouse appeared, she seized it in her beak, and\r\ncarried it to a meadow adjoining, where she would play with it like a\r\nyoung cat for some time, and then kill it. She has been known to catch\r\nfour or five mice a day in this manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE VIII.\r\n\r\nMaking Sure.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the war between Augustus C\xc3\xa6sar and Marc Antony, when all the world\r\nstood wondering and uncertain which way Fortune would incline herself, a\r\npoor man at Rome, in order to be prepared for making, in either event, a\r\nbold hit for his own advancement, had recourse to the following ingenious\r\nexpedient. He applied himself to the training of two crows with such\r\ndiligence, that he brought them the length of pronouncing with great\r\ndistinctness, the one a salutation to C\xc3\xa6sar, and the other a salutation to\r\nAntony. When Augustus returned conqueror, the man went out to meet him\r\nwith the crow suited to the occasion perched on his fist, and every now\r\nand then it kept exclaiming, "_Salve, C\xc3\xa6sar, Victor Imperator!_" "Hail,\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar, Conqueror and Emperor!" Augustus, greatly struck and delighted with\r\nso novel a circumstance, purchased the bird of the man for a sum which\r\nimmediately raised him into opulence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE IX.\r\n\r\nThe Power of Music.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Sunday evening, five choristers were walking on the banks of a river;\r\nafter some time, being tired with walking, they sat down on the grass, and\r\nbegan to sing an anthem. The field on which they sat was terminated at one\r\nextremity by a wood, out of which, as they were singing, they observed a\r\nhare to pass with great swiftness towards the place where they were\r\nsitting, and to stop at about twenty yards\' distance from them. She\r\nappeared highly delighted with the harmony of the music, often turning up\r\nthe side of her head to listen with more facility. As soon as the\r\nharmonious sound was over, the hare returned slowly towards the wood; when\r\nshe had nearly reached the end of the field, the choristers began the same\r\npiece again; at which the hare stopped, turned round, and came swiftly\r\nback to about the same distance as before, where she seemed to listen with\r\nrapture and delight, till they had finished the anthem, when she returned\r\nagain by a slow pace up the field, and entered the wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE X.\r\n\r\nA Conversing Parrot.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the government of Prince Maurice in Brazil, he had heard of an old\r\nparrot that was much celebrated for answering like a rational creature\r\nmany of the common questions put to it. It was at a great distance; but so\r\nmuch had been said about it that the prince\'s curiosity was roused, and he\r\ndirected it to be sent for. When it was introduced into the room where the\r\nprince was sitting, in company with several Dutchmen, it immediately\r\nexclaimed in the Brazilian language, "What a company of white men are\r\nhere!" They asked it, "Who is that man?" (pointing to the prince). The\r\nparrot answered, "Some general or other." When the attendants carried it\r\nup to him, he asked it, through the medium of an interpreter (for he was\r\nignorant of its language), "Whence do you come?" The parrot answered,\r\n"From Marignan." The prince asked, "To whom do you belong?" It answered,\r\n"To a Portuguese." He asked again, "What do you there?" It answered, "I\r\nlook after chickens." The prince laughing, exclaimed, "You look after\r\nchickens!" The parrot in answer said, "Yes, I; and I know well enough how\r\nto do it;" clucking at the same time in imitation of the noise made by the\r\nhen to call together her young.\r\n\r\nThe prince afterwards observed that although the parrot spoke in a\r\nlanguage he did not understand, yet he could not be deceived, for he had\r\nin the room both a Dutchman who spoke Brazilian, and a Brazilian who spoke\r\nDutch; that he asked them separately and privately, and both agreed\r\nexactly in their account of the parrot\'s discourse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XI.\r\n\r\nMimic.\r\n\r\n\r\nA priest once brought up an ourang-outang, which became so fond of him\r\nthat, wherever he went, it was always desirous of accompanying him.\r\nWhenever therefore he had to perform the service of his church, he was\r\nunder the necessity of shutting it up in his room. Once, however, the\r\nanimal escaped, and followed the father to the church; where silently\r\nmounting the sounding-board above the pulpit, he lay perfectly still till\r\nthe sermon commenced. He then crept to the edge, and overlooking the\r\npreacher, imitated all his gestures in so grotesque a manner, that the\r\nwhole congregation were unavoidably urged to laugh. The father, surprised\r\nand confounded at this ill-timed levity, severely rebuked his audience for\r\ntheir inattention. The reproof failed in its effect; the congregation\r\nstill laughed, and the preacher in the warmth of his zeal redoubled his\r\nvociferation and his action; these the ape imitated so exactly that the\r\ncongregation could no longer restrain themselves, but burst out into a\r\nloud and continued laughter. A friend of the preacher at length stepped up\r\nto him, and pointed out the cause of this improper conduct; and such was\r\nthe arch demeanour of the animal that it was with the utmost difficulty he\r\ncould himself command his gravity, while he ordered the servants of the\r\nchurch to take him away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XII.\r\n\r\nThe Heroism of a Hen.\r\n\r\n\r\nA contest of rather an unusual nature took place in the house of a\r\nrespectable innkeeper in Ireland. The parties concerned were, a hen of the\r\ngame species, and a rat of the middle size. The hen, in an accidental\r\nperambulation round a spacious room, accompanied by an only chicken, the\r\nsole surviving offspring of a numerous brood, was roused to madness by an\r\nunprovoked attack made by a voracious cowardly rat on her unsuspecting\r\nchirping companion. The shrieks of the beloved captive, while being\r\ndragged away by the enemy, excited every maternal feeling in the\r\naffectionate bosom of the feathered dame; she flew at the corner whence\r\nthe alarm arose, seized the lurking enemy by the neck, writhed him about\r\nthe room, put out one of his eyes in the engagement, and so fatigued her\r\nopponent by repeated attacks of spur and bill, that in the space of twelve\r\nminutes, during which time the conflict lasted, she put a final period to\r\nthe nocturnal invader\'s existence; nimbly turned round, in wild but\r\ntriumphant distraction, to her palpitating nestling, and hugged it in her\r\nvictorious bosom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XIII.\r\n\r\nThe Cat and Crows.\r\n\r\n\r\nA pair of crows once made their nest in a tree, of which there were\r\nseveral planted round the garden of a gentleman, who, in his morning\r\nwalks, was often amused by witnessing furious combats between the crows\r\nand a cat. One morning the battle raged more fiercely than usual, till at\r\nlast the cat gave way, and took shelter under a hedge, as if to wait a\r\nmore favourable opportunity of retreating into the house. The crows\r\ncontinued for a short time to make a threatening noise; but perceiving\r\nthat on the ground they could do nothing more than threaten, one of them\r\nlifted a stone from the middle of the garden, and perched with it on a\r\ntree planted in the hedge, where she sat, watching the motions of the\r\nenemy of her young. As the cat crept along under the hedge, the crow\r\naccompanied her, flying from branch to branch, and from tree to tree; and\r\nwhen at last puss ventured to quit her hiding-place, the crow, leaving the\r\ntrees and hovering over her in the air, let the stone drop from on high on\r\nher back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XIV.\r\n\r\nFilial Duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nA surgeon\'s mate on board a ship relates that while lying one evening\r\nawake he saw a rat come into his berth, and after well surveying the\r\nplace, retreat with the greatest caution and silence. Soon after it\r\nreturned, leading by the ear another rat, which it left at a small\r\ndistance from the hole which they entered. A third rat joined this kind\r\nconductor; they then foraged about, and picked up all the small scraps of\r\nbiscuit; these they carried to the second rat, which seemed blind, and\r\nremained in the spot where they had left it, nibbling such fare as its\r\ndutiful providers, whom the narrator supposes were its offspring, brought\r\nto it from the more remote parts of the floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XV.\r\n\r\nThe Dinner Bell.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is customary in large boarding-houses to announce the dinner-hour by\r\nthe sound of a bell. A cat belonging to one of these houses always\r\nhastened to the hall on hearing the bell, to get its accustomed meal; but\r\nit happened one day that she was shut up in a chamber, and it was in vain\r\nfor her that the bell had sounded. Some hours after, having been released\r\nfrom her confinement, she hastened to the hall, but found nothing left for\r\nher. The cat thus disappointed got to the bell, and sounding it,\r\nendeavoured to summon the family to a second dinner, in which she doubted\r\nnot to participate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XVI.\r\n\r\nA Singular Interposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lady had a tame bird which she was in the habit of letting out of its\r\ncage every day. One morning as it was picking crumbs of bread off the\r\ncarpet, her cat, who always before showed great kindness for the bird,\r\nseized it on a sudden, and jumped with it in her mouth upon a table. The\r\nlady was much alarmed for the fate of her favourite, but on turning about\r\ninstantly discerned the cause. The door had been left open, and a strange\r\ncat had just come into the room! After turning it out, her own cat came\r\ndown from her place of safety, and dropped the bird without having done it\r\nthe smallest injury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XVII.\r\n\r\nOdd Fraternity.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentleman travelling through Mecklenburg was witness to the following\r\ncurious circumstance in an inn at which he was staying. After dinner, the\r\nlandlord placed on the floor a large dish of soup, and gave a loud\r\nwhistle. Immediately there came into the room a mastiff, a fine Angora\r\ncat, an old raven, and a remarkably large rat with a bell about its neck.\r\nThese four animals went to the dish, and without disturbing each other,\r\nfed together; after which the dog, cat, and rat lay before the fire, while\r\nthe raven hopped about the room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XVIII.\r\n\r\nCanine Smugglers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands, they use dogs of a very large and strong breed, for\r\nthe purpose of draught. They are harnessed like horses, and chiefly\r\nemployed in drawing little carts with fish, vegetables, &c., to market.\r\nPrevious to the year 1795, such dogs were also employed in smuggling;\r\nwhich was the more easy, as they are exceedingly docile. The dogs were\r\ntrained to go backwards and forwards between two places on the frontiers,\r\nwithout any person to attend them. Being loaded with little parcels of\r\ngoods, lace, &c., like mules, they set out at midnight, and only went when\r\nit was perfectly dark. An excellent quick-scented dog always went some\r\npaces before the others, stretched out his nose towards all quarters, and\r\nwhen he scented custom-house officers, turned back, which was the signal\r\nfor immediate flight. Concealed behind bushes, or in ditches, the dogs\r\nwaited till all was safe, then proceeded on their journey, and reached at\r\nlast beyond the frontier the dwelling-house of the receiver of the goods,\r\nwho was in the secret. But here, also, the leading dog only at first\r\nshowed himself; on a certain whistle, which was a signal that all was\r\nright, they all hastened up. They were then unloaded, taken to a\r\nconvenient stable, where there was a good layer of hay, and well fed.\r\nThere they rested until midnight, and then returned in the same manner\r\nback, over the frontiers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XIX.\r\n\r\nA Canine Sheep-Stealer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA shepherd, who was hanged for sheep-stealing, used to commit his\r\ndepredations by means of his dog. When he intended to steal any sheep, he\r\ndetached the dog to perform the business. With this view, under pretence\r\nof looking at the sheep, with an intention to purchase them, he went\r\nthrough the flock with the dog at his foot, to whom he secretly gave a\r\nsignal, so as to let him know the particular sheep he wanted, perhaps to\r\nthe number of ten or twelve, out of a flock of some hundreds; he then went\r\naway, and from a distance of several miles, sent back the dog by himself\r\nin the night time, who picked out the individual sheep that had been\r\npointed out to him, separated them from the flock, and drove them before\r\nhim, frequently a distance of ten or twelve miles, till he came up with\r\nhis master, to whom he delivered up his charge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XX.\r\n\r\nThe Dog and Goose.\r\n\r\n\r\nA goose was once observed to attach itself in the strongest and most\r\naffectionate manner to the house dog, but never presumed to go into the\r\nkennel except in rainy weather; whenever the dog barked, the goose would\r\ncackle, and run at the person she supposed the dog barked at, and try to\r\nbite him by the heels. Sometimes she would attempt to feed with the dog;\r\nbut this the dog, who treated his faithful companion with indifference,\r\nwould not suffer. This bird would not go to roost with the others at\r\nnight, unless driven by main force; and when in the morning they were\r\nturned into the field, she would never stir from the yard gate, but sit\r\nthere the whole day in sight of the dog. At length orders were given that\r\nshe should no longer be molested; being thus left to herself, she ran\r\nabout the yard with him all night, and what is particularly remarkable,\r\nwhenever the dog went out of the yard and ran into the village, the goose\r\nalways accompanied him, contriving to keep up with him by the assistance\r\nof her wings, and in this way of running and flying, followed him all over\r\nthe parish. This extraordinary affection of the goose towards the dog,\r\nwhich continued till his death, two years after it was first observed, is\r\nsupposed to have originated in his having saved her from a fox, in the\r\nvery moment of distress.\r\n\r\nWhile the dog was ill, the goose never quitted him, day or night, not even\r\nto feed; and it was apprehended that she would have been starved to death\r\nhad not a pan of corn been set every day close to the kennel. At this time\r\nthe goose generally sat in the kennel, and would not suffer any one to\r\napproach it, except the person who brought the dog\'s, or her own food. The\r\nend of this faithful bird was melancholy; for when the dog died, she would\r\nstill keep possession of the kennel, and a new house dog being introduced,\r\nwhich in size and colour resembled that lately lost, the poor goose was\r\nunhappily deceived, and going into the kennel as usual, the new inhabitant\r\nseized her by the throat and killed her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXI.\r\n\r\nSabinus and his Dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the execution of Sabinus, the Roman general, who suffered death for\r\nhis attachment to the family of Germanicus, his body was exposed to the\r\npublic upon the precipice of the Gemoni\xc3\xa6, as a warning to all who should\r\ndare to befriend the house of Germanicus: no friend had courage to\r\napproach the body; one only remained true--his faithful dog. For three\r\ndays the animal continued to watch the body; his pathetic howlings\r\nawakened the sympathy of every heart. Food was brought him, which he was\r\nkindly encouraged to eat; but on taking the bread, instead of obeying the\r\nimpulse of hunger, he fondly laid it on his master\'s mouth, and renewed\r\nhis lamentations; days thus passed, nor did he for a moment quit the body.\r\n\r\nThe body was at length thrown into the Tiber, and the generous creature,\r\nstill unwilling that it should perish, leaped into the water after it, and\r\nclasping the corpse between its paws, vainly endeavoured to preserve it\r\nfrom sinking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXII.\r\n\r\nWrens Learning to Sing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA wren built her nest in a box, so situated that a family had an\r\nopportunity of observing the mother bird instructing the young ones in the\r\nart of singing peculiar to the species. She fixed herself on one side of\r\nthe opening in the box, directly before her young, and began by singing\r\nover her whole song very distinctly. One of the young then attempted to\r\nimitate her. After proceeding through a few notes, its voice broke, and it\r\nlost the tune. The mother immediately recommenced where the young one had\r\nfailed, and went very distinctly through the remainder. The young bird\r\nmade a second attempt, commencing where it had ceased before, and\r\ncontinuing the song as long as it was able; and when the note was again\r\nlost, the mother began anew where it stopped, and completed it. Then the\r\nyoung one resumed the tune and finished it. This done, the mother sang\r\nover the whole series of notes a second time with great precision; and a\r\nsecond of the young attempted to follow her. The wren pursued the same\r\ncourse with this as with the first; and so with the third and fourth. It\r\nsometimes happened that the young one would lose the tune three, four, or\r\nmore times in the same attempt; in which case the mother uniformly began\r\nwhere they ceased, and sung the remaining notes; and when each had\r\ncompleted the trial, she repeated the whole strain. Sometimes two of the\r\nyoung commenced together. The mother observed the same conduct towards\r\nthem as when one sang alone. This was repeated day after day, and several\r\ntimes in a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Dog of Montargis.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Frenchman of family and fortune, travelling alone through a forest, was\r\nmurdered and buried under a tree. His dog, an English bloodhound, would\r\nnot quit his master\'s grave, till at length, compelled by hunger, he\r\nproceeded to the house of a friend of his master\'s, and by his melancholy\r\nhowling seemed desirous of expressing the loss they had both sustained. He\r\nrepeated his cries, ran to the door, looked back to see if any one\r\nfollowed him, returned to his master\'s friend, pulled him by the sleeve,\r\nand with dumb eloquence entreated him to go with him.\r\n\r\nStruck by these actions, the company decided to follow the dog, who led\r\nthem to a tree where he began scratching the earth and howling. On\r\ndigging, the body of the unhappy man was found.\r\n\r\nSome time after, the dog accidentally met the assassin; when instantly\r\nseizing him by the throat, he was with great difficulty compelled to quit\r\nhis prey. As the dog continued to pursue and attack his master\'s murderer,\r\nalthough docile to all others, his behaviour began to attract notice and\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nAt length the affair reached the king\'s ear, who sent for the dog, who\r\nappeared extremely gentle till he saw the murderer, when he ran fiercely\r\ntowards him, growling at and attacking him as usual.\r\n\r\nThe king, struck with such a collection of circumstantial evidence,\r\ndetermined to refer the decision to the chance of battle; in other words,\r\nhe gave orders for a combat between the assassin and the dog. The lists\r\nwere appointed, and the man was allowed for his weapon a great cudgel.\r\n\r\nAn empty cask was given to the dog as a place of retreat, to enable him to\r\nrecover breath. The dog finding himself at liberty ran around his\r\nadversary, avoiding his blows, and menacing him on every side, till his\r\nstrength was exhausted; then springing forward, he gripped him by the\r\nthroat, threw him on the ground, and obliged him to confess before the\r\nking and the whole court. The assassin was afterwards convicted and\r\nbeheaded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Bear and Child.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeopold, Duke of Lorraine, had a bear called Marco, of the sagacity and\r\nsensibility of which we have the following remarkable instance. During a\r\nsevere winter, a boy, ready to perish with cold, thought proper to enter\r\nMarco\'s hut, without reflecting on the danger which he ran in exposing\r\nhimself to the mercy of the animal which occupied it. Marco, however,\r\ninstead of doing any injury to the child, took him between his paws, and\r\nwarmed him by pressing him to his breast until the next morning, when he\r\nsuffered him to depart. The boy returned in the evening to the hut, and\r\nwas received with the same affection. For several days he had no other\r\nretreat, and it added not a little to his joy, to perceive that the bear\r\nregularly reserved part of his food for him. A number of days passed in\r\nthis manner without the servants knowing anything of the circumstance. At\r\nlength, when one of them came one day to bring the bear his supper, rather\r\nlater than ordinary, he was astonished to see the animal roll his eyes in\r\na furious manner, and seeming as if he wished him to make as little noise\r\nas possible, for fear of awaking the child, whom he clasped to his breast.\r\nThe animal, though ravenous, did not appear the least moved with the food\r\nwhich was placed before him. The report of this extraordinary circumstance\r\nwas soon spread at court, and reached the ears of Leopold; who, with part\r\nof his courtiers, was desirous of being satisfied of the truth of Marco\'s\r\ngenerosity. Several of them passed the night near his hut, and beheld with\r\nastonishment that the bear never stirred as long as his guest showed an\r\ninclination to sleep. At dawn the child awoke, was very much ashamed to\r\nfind himself discovered, and, fearing that he would be punished for his\r\nrashness, begged pardon. The bear, however, caressed him, and endeavoured\r\nto prevail on him to eat what had been brought to him the evening before,\r\nwhich he did at the request of the spectators, who conducted him to the\r\nprince. Having learned the whole story, Leopold ordered care to be taken\r\nof the little boy, who would doubtless have soon made his fortune, had he\r\nnot died a short time after.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXV.\r\n\r\nThe Dolphin.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Augustus C\xc3\xa6sar there was a dolphin in the Lucrine lake,\r\nwhich formed a most romantic attachment to a poor man\'s son. The boy had\r\nto go every day from Bai\xc3\xa6 to Puteoli to school, and such were the friendly\r\nterms on which he had got with the dolphin, that he had only to wait by\r\nthe banks of the lake and cry, _Simo_, _Simo_, the name he had given to\r\nthe animal, when, lo! Simo came scudding to the shore, let fall the sharp\r\nprickles of his skin, and gently offered his back for the boy to mount\r\nupon. The boy, nothing afraid, used to mount instantly, when the dolphin,\r\nwithout either rein or spur, would speed across the sea to Puteoli, and\r\nafter landing the young scholar, wait about the vicinity till he was\r\nreturning home, when it would again perform the same sort of civil\r\nservice. The boy was not ungrateful for such extraordinary favour, and\r\nused every day to bring a good store of victuals for Simo, which the\r\nanimal would take from his hand in the most tame and kindly manner\r\nimaginable. For several years this friendly intercourse was kept up; it\r\nwas, in fact, only terminated by the death of the boy; when, as the story\r\ngoes, the dolphin was so affected at seeing him return no more, that it\r\nthrew itself on the shore, and died, _as was thought_, of very grief and\r\nsorrow!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \'BUT PAST BELIEF, A DOLPHIN\'S ARCHED BACK PRESERVED ARION\r\nFROM HIS DESTINED WRACK; SECURE HE SITS, AND WITH HARMONIOUS STRAINS\r\nREQUITES THE BEARER FOR HIS FRIENDLY PAINS.\']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXVI.\r\n\r\nThe Death of Antiochus Revenged.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Antiochus was slain in battle by Centaretrius the Galatian, the\r\nvictor exultingly leaped on the back of the fallen king\'s horse; but he\r\nhad no sooner done so, than the animal, as if sensible that it was\r\nbestrode by the slayer of his master, instantly exhibited signs of the\r\ngreatest fury, and bounding forwards to the top of a lofty rock, with a\r\nspeed which defied every attempt of Centaretrius to disengage himself,\r\nleaped with him over the precipice, at the foot of which both were found\r\ndashed to pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXVII.\r\n\r\nMice as Navigators.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there are few who would dispute the cleverness and sagacity of\r\nthe larger animals, it is doubtful if there are many who credit the mouse\r\nwith even average intelligence. The following instance may go far to raise\r\nour humble friend in the popular estimation; more especially as it has\r\nbeen vouched for by eye-witnesses. In countries where berries are but\r\nthinly dispersed, these little animals are obliged to cross rivers to make\r\ntheir distant forages. In returning with their booty to their magazines,\r\nthey are obliged to recross the stream; in doing which they show an\r\ningenuity little short of marvellous. The party, which consists of from\r\nsix to ten, select a water-lily leaf, or some other floating substance, on\r\nwhich they place the berries on a heap in the middle; then, by their\r\nunited force, bring it to the water\'s edge, and after launching it, embark\r\nand place themselves round the heap, with their heads joined over it, and\r\ntheir backs to the water. In this manner they drift down the stream, until\r\nthey reach the opposite shore, when they unload their cargo, which they\r\nstore away for the proverbial rainy day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXVIII.\r\n\r\nA Calculating Crow.\r\n\r\n\r\nA carrion crow, perceiving a brood of fourteen chickens under the care of\r\nthe parent-hen, on a lawn, picked up one; but on a young lady opening the\r\nwindow and giving an alarm, the robber dropped his prey. In the course of\r\nthe day, however, the plunderer returned, accompanied by thirteen other\r\ncrows, when every one seized his bird, and carried off the whole brood at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXIX.\r\n\r\nPorus Saved by his Elephant.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Porus, in a battle with Alexander the Great, being severely wounded,\r\nfell from the back of his elephant. The Macedonian soldiers, supposing him\r\ndead, pushed forward, in order to despoil him of his rich clothing and\r\naccoutrements; but the faithful elephant, standing over the body of its\r\nmaster, boldly repelled every one who dared to approach, and while the\r\nenemy stood at bay, took the bleeding Porus up with his trunk, and placed\r\nhim again on his back. The troops of Porus came by this time to his\r\nrelief, and the king was saved; but the elephant died of the wounds which\r\nit had received in the heroic defence of its master.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXX.\r\n\r\nDrawing Water.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago, an ass was employed at Carisbrook Castle, in the Isle of\r\nWight, in drawing water by a large wheel from a very deep well, supposed\r\nto have been sunk by the Romans. When the keeper wanted water, he would\r\nsay to the ass, "Tom, my boy, I want water; get into the wheel, my good\r\nlad;" which Thomas immediately performed with an alacrity and sagacity\r\nthat would have done credit to a nobler animal; and no doubt he knew the\r\nprecise number of times necessary for the wheel to revolve upon its axis,\r\nto complete his labour, because every time he brought the bucket to the\r\nsurface of the well, he constantly stopped and turned round his honest\r\nhead to observe the moment when his master laid hold of the bucket to draw\r\nit towards him, because he had then a nice evolution to make, either to\r\nrecede or to advance a little. It was pleasing to observe with what\r\nsteadiness and regularity the poor animal performed his labour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXXI.\r\n\r\nThe Broken Heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the French Revolution M. des R----, an ancient magistrate and most\r\nestimable man, was condemned to death on the charge of conspiracy and\r\nthrown into prison. M. des R---- had a water spaniel, which had been\r\nbrought up by him, and had never quitted him. Refused admission to the\r\nprison, he returned to his master\'s house, and found it shut; he took\r\nrefuge with a neighbour. Every day at the same hour the dog left the\r\nhouse, and went to the door of the prison. He was refused admittance, but\r\nhe constantly passed an hour before it, and then returned. His fidelity at\r\nlength won over the porter, and he was one day allowed to enter. The dog\r\nsaw his master and clung to him. The gaoler with difficulty forced him\r\naway. He came back the next morning, and every day; once each day he was\r\nadmitted. He licked the hand of his friend, looked him in the face, again\r\nlicked his hand, and went away of himself.\r\n\r\nAfter the execution, at which the dog was present, he walked by the side\r\nof the corpse to its burial-place, and after the ceremony laid himself\r\nupon the grave. There he passed the first night, the next day, and the\r\nsecond night. The neighbour in the meantime, unhappy at not seeing him,\r\ngoes in search of his friend, finds him by his master\'s grave, caresses\r\nhim, and makes him eat. An hour afterwards the dog escaped, and regained\r\nhis favourite place. Three months passed away, each morning of which he\r\ncame to seek his food, and then returned to the grave of his master; but\r\neach day he was more sad, more meagre, more languishing. He was chained\r\nup, but broke his fetters; escaped; returned to the grave, and never\r\nquitted it more. It was in vain that they tried to bring him back. They\r\ncarried him food, but he ate no longer. For hours he was seen employing\r\nhis weakened limbs in digging up the earth that separated him from his\r\nmaster. Passion gave him strength, and he gradually approached the body;\r\nat last his faithful heart gave way, and he breathed out his last gasp, as\r\nif he knew that he had found his master.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXXII.\r\n\r\nA Comedy of Quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a play exhibited at Rome, in the reign of Tiberius, there were twelve\r\nelephant performers, six males and six females, clothed in fancy costume.\r\nAfter they had, at the command of their keeper, danced and performed a\r\nthousand curious antics, a most sumptuous feast was served up for their\r\nrefreshment. The table was covered with all sorts of dainties, and golden\r\ngoblets filled with the most precious wines; and beds covered with purple\r\ncarpets were placed around for the animals to lie upon, after the manner\r\nof the Romans when feasting. On these carpets the elephants laid\r\nthemselves down, and at a given signal they reached out their trunks to\r\nthe table, and fell to eating and drinking with as much propriety as if\r\nthey had been so many honest citizens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXXIII.\r\n\r\nCunning as a Fox.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn American gentleman was in pursuit of foxes, accompanied by two\r\nbloodhounds; the dogs were soon in scent, and pursued a fox nearly two\r\nhours, when suddenly they appeared at fault. The gentleman came up with\r\nthem near a large log lying upon the ground, and felt much surprised to\r\nfind them taking a circuit of a few rods without an object, every trace of\r\nthe game seeming to have been lost, while they kept still yelping. On\r\nlooking about him, he discovered sly Reynard stretched upon the log,\r\napparently lifeless. The master made several efforts to direct the\r\nattention of his dogs towards the fox but failed; at length he approached\r\nso near the artful object of his pursuit as to see him breathe. Even then\r\nno alarm was exhibited; and the gentleman seizing a club, aimed a blow at\r\nhim, which Reynard evaded by a leap from his singular lurking-place,\r\nhaving thus for a time effectually eluded his rapacious pursuers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXXIV.\r\n\r\nMore Faithful than Favoured.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentleman once possessed a mastiff which guarded the house and yard, but\r\nhad never met with the least particular attention from his master. One\r\nnight, as his master was retiring to his chamber, attended by his\r\n_faithful_ valet, an Italian, the mastiff silently followed him upstairs,\r\nwhich he had never been known to do before, and, to his master\'s\r\nastonishment, presented himself in his bedroom. He was instantly turned\r\nout; but the poor animal began scratching violently at the door, and\r\nhowling loudly for admission. The servant was sent to drive him away;\r\nstill he returned again, and was more importunate than before to be let\r\nin. The gentleman, weary of opposition, bade the servant open the door,\r\nthat they might see what he wanted to do. This done, the dog deliberately\r\nwalked up, and crawling under the bed, laid himself down as if desirous to\r\ntake up his night\'s lodging there. To save farther trouble, the indulgence\r\nwas allowed. About midnight the chamber door opened, and a person was\r\nheard stepping across the room. The gentleman started from his sleep; the\r\ndog sprung from his covert, and seizing the unwelcome disturber, fixed him\r\nto the spot! All was dark; and the gentleman rang his bell in great\r\ntrepidation, in order to procure a light. The person who was pinned to the\r\nfloor by the courageous mastiff roared for assistance. It was found to be\r\nthe valet, who little expected such a reception. He endeavoured to\r\napologise for his intrusion, and to make the reasons which induced him to\r\ntake this step appear plausible; but the importunity of the dog, the time,\r\nthe place, the manner of the valet, all raised suspicions in his master\'s\r\nmind, and he determined to refer the investigation of the business to a\r\nmagistrate. The perfidious Italian at length confessed that it was his\r\nintention to murder his master, and then rob the house. This diabolical\r\ndesign was frustrated only by the instinctive attachment of the dog to his\r\nmaster, which seemed to have been directed on this occasion by the\r\ninterference of Providence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXXV.\r\n\r\nElephant Rope Dancing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ease with which the elephant is taught to perform the most agile and\r\ndifficult feats, forms a remarkable contrast to its huge unwieldiness of\r\nsize. Aristotle tells us that in ancient times elephants were taught by\r\ntheir keepers to throw stones at a mark, to cast up arms in the air, and\r\ncatch them again on their fall; and to dance not merely on the earth, but\r\non the rope. The first, according to Suetonius, who exhibited elephant\r\nrope dancers, was Galba at Rome. The manner of teaching them to dance on\r\nthe ground was simple enough (by the association of music and a hot\r\nfloor); but we are not informed how they were taught to skip the rope, or\r\nwhether it was the tight or the slack rope, or how high the rope might be.\r\nThe silence of history on these points is fortunate for the figurantes of\r\nthe present day; since, but for this, their fame might have been utterly\r\neclipsed. Elephants may, in the days of old Rome, have been taught to\r\ndance on the rope, but when was an elephant ever known to skip on a rope\r\nover the heads of an audience, or to caper amidst a blaze of fire fifty\r\nfeet aloft in the air? What would Aristotle have thought of his dancing\r\nelephants if he had seen some of the elephants who perform to-day?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXXVI.\r\n\r\nA Providential Safe Conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nA traveller gives a singular anecdote of a lion, which he says was related\r\nto him by very credible persons. About the year 1614 or 1615, two\r\nChristian slaves at Morocco made their escape, travelling by night, and\r\nhiding themselves in the tops of trees during the day, their Arab pursuers\r\nfrequently passing by them. One night, while pursuing their journey, they\r\nwere much astonished and alarmed to see a great lion close by them, who\r\nwalked when they walked, and stood still when they stood. Thinking this a\r\nsafe conduct sent to them by Providence, they took courage, and travelled\r\nin the daytime in company with the lion. The horsemen who had been sent in\r\npursuit came up, and would have seized upon them, but the lion interposed,\r\nand they were suffered to pass on. Every day these poor fugitives met with\r\nsome one or other of the human race who wanted to seize them, but the lion\r\nwas their protector until they reached the sea coast in safety, when he\r\nleft them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXXVII.\r\n\r\nA Generous Revenge.\r\n\r\n\r\nA young man, desirous of getting rid of his dog, took it along with him to\r\nthe river. He hired a boat, and rowing into the stream, threw the animal\r\nin. The poor creature attempted to climb up the side of the boat, but his\r\nmaster, whose intention was to drown him, constantly pushed him back with\r\nthe oar. In doing this, he fell himself into the water, and would\r\ncertainly have been drowned, had not the dog, as soon as he saw his master\r\nstruggling in the stream, suffered the boat to float away, and held him\r\nabove water till assistance arrived, and his life was saved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nAre Beasts mere Machines?\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentleman one day talking with a friend maintained that beasts were mere\r\nmachines, and had no sort of reason to direct them; and that when they\r\ncried or made a noise, it was only one of the wheels of the clock or\r\nmachine that made it. The friend, who was of a different opinion, replied,\r\n"I have now in my kitchen two turnspits, who take their turns regularly\r\nevery other day to get into the wheel; one of them, not liking his\r\nemployment, hid himself on the day that he should work, so that his\r\ncompanion was forced to mount the wheel in his stead, but crying and\r\nwagging his tail, he made a sign for those in attendance to follow him. He\r\nimmediately conducted them to a garret, where he dislodged the idle dog,\r\nand killed him immediately."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XXXIX.\r\n\r\nLong Lost Found Again.\r\n\r\n\r\nA female elephant belonging to a gentleman at Calcutta broke loose from\r\nher keeper, and was lost in the woods. The excuses which the keeper made\r\nwere not admitted. It was supposed that he had sold the elephant; his wife\r\nand family therefore were sold for slaves, and he was himself condemned to\r\nwork upon the roads. About twelve years after, this man was ordered into\r\nthe country to assist in catching wild elephants. The keeper fancied he\r\nsaw his long-lost elephant in a group that was before them. He was\r\ndetermined to go up to it; nor could the strongest representations of the\r\ndanger dissuade him from his purpose. When he approached the creature, she\r\nknew him, and giving him three salutes, by waving her trunk in the air,\r\nknelt down and received him on her back. She afterwards assisted in\r\nsecuring the other elephants, and likewise brought her three young ones.\r\nThe keeper recovered his character; and, as a recompense for his\r\nsufferings and intrepidity, had an annuity settled on him for life. This\r\nelephant was afterwards in the possession of Governor Hastings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XL.\r\n\r\nOstrich Riding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentleman tells how, during the time of his residence at Podor, a French\r\nfactory on the banks of the river Niger, there were two ostriches, though\r\nyoung, of gigantic size, which afforded him a very remarkable sight. "They\r\nwere," he says, "so tame, that two little blacks mounted both together on\r\nthe back of the largest. No sooner did he feel their weight, than he began\r\nto run as fast as possible, and carried them several times round the\r\nvillage, as it was impossible to stop him otherwise than by obstructing\r\nthe passage. This sight pleased me so much, that I wished it to be\r\nrepeated, and to try their strength, directed a full-grown negro to mount\r\nthe smallest, and two others the largest. This burthen did not seem at all\r\ndisproportionate to their strength. At first they went at a tolerably\r\nsharp trot, but when they became heated a little, they expanded their\r\nwings as though to catch the wind, and moved with such fleetness, that\r\nthey scarcely seemed to touch the ground. Most people have, at one time or\r\nanother, seen a partridge run; and consequently know that there is no man\r\nwhatever able to keep up with it; and it is easy to imagine, that if this\r\nbird had a longer step, its speed would be considerably augmented. The\r\nostrich moves like the partridge, with this advantage; and I am satisfied\r\nthat those I am speaking of would have distanced the fleetest racehorses\r\nthat were ever bred in England. It is true they would not hold out so long\r\nas a horse; but they would undoubtedly go over a given space in less time.\r\nI have frequently beheld this sight, which is capable of giving one an\r\nidea of the prodigious strength of an ostrich, and of showing what use it\r\nmight be of, had we but the method of breaking and managing it as we do a\r\nhorse."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XLI.\r\n\r\nA Choice Retaliation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA tame elephant kept by a merchant was suffered to go at large. The animal\r\nused to walk about the streets in as quiet and familiar a manner as any of\r\nthe inhabitants, and delighted much in visiting the shops, particularly\r\nthose which sold herbs and fruit, where he was well received, except by a\r\ncouple of brutal cobblers, who, without any cause, took offence at the\r\ngenerous creature, and once or twice attempted to wound his proboscis with\r\ntheir awls. The noble animal, who knew it was beneath him to crush them,\r\ndid not disdain to chastise them by other means. He filled his large trunk\r\nwith a considerable quantity of water, not of the cleanest quality, and\r\nadvancing to them as usual, covered them at once with a dirty flood. The\r\nfools were laughed at, and the punishment applauded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XLII.\r\n\r\nThe Horse and Greyhound.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious have been the opinions upon the difference of speed between a\r\nwell-bred greyhound and a racehorse if opposed to each other. Wishes had\r\nbeen frequently indulged by the sporting world that some criterion could\r\nbe adopted by which the superiority of speed could be fairly ascertained,\r\nwhen the following circumstance accidentally took place, and afforded some\r\ninformation upon what had been previously considered a matter of great\r\nuncertainty. In the month of December 1800 a match was to have been run\r\nover Doncaster racecourse for one hundred guineas, but one of the horses\r\nhaving been withdrawn, a mare started alone, that by running the ground\r\nshe might ensure the wager; when having run about one mile in the four,\r\nshe was accompanied by a greyhound, which joined her from the side of the\r\ncourse, and emulatively entering into the competition, continued to race\r\nwith the mare for the other three miles, keeping nearly head and head, and\r\naffording an excellent treat to the field by the energetic exertions of\r\neach. At passing the distance post five to four was betted in favour of\r\nthe greyhound, when parallel with the stand it was even betting, and any\r\nperson might have taken his choice from five to ten; the mare, however,\r\nhad the advantage by a head at the termination of the course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XLIII.\r\n\r\nThe Goat.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentleman who had taken an active share in the rebellion of 1715, after\r\nthe battle of Preston escaped into the West Highlands, where a lady, a\r\nnear relative, afforded him an asylum. A faithful servant conducted him to\r\nthe mouth of a cave, and furnished him with an abundant store of\r\nprovisions. The fugitive crept in at a low aperture, dragging his stores\r\nalong. When he reached a wider and loftier expanse he found some obstacle\r\nbefore him. He drew his dirk, but unwilling to strike, lest he might take\r\nthe life of a companion in seclusion, he stooped down, and discovered a\r\ngoat with her kid stretched on the ground. He soon perceived that the\r\nanimal was in great pain, and feeling her body and limbs, ascertained that\r\nher leg was fractured. He bound it up with his garter, and offered her a\r\nshare of the bread beside him; but she stretched out her tongue, as if to\r\napprise him that her mouth was parched with thirst. He gave her water,\r\nwhich she took readily, and then ate some bread. After midnight he\r\nventured out of the cave: all was still. He plucked an armful of grass and\r\ncut tender twigs, which the goat accepted with manifestations of joy and\r\nthankfulness. The prisoner derived much comfort in having a living\r\ncreature in this dungeon, and he caressed and fed her tenderly. The man\r\nwho was entrusted to bring him supplies fell sick; and when another\r\nattempted to penetrate into the cavern the goat furiously opposed him,\r\npresenting her horns in all directions, till the fugitive, hearing a\r\ndisturbance, came forward. This new attendant giving the watchword removed\r\nevery doubt of his good intentions, and the amazon of the recess obeyed\r\nher benefactor in permitting him to advance. The gentleman was convinced\r\nthat had a band of military attacked the cavern, his grateful patient\r\nwould have died in his defence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XLIV.\r\n\r\nA Mother Watching her Young.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following singular instance of the far-sighted watchfulness of the\r\nturkey-hen over her young is narrated by a French priest. "I have heard,"\r\nhe says, "a turkey-hen, when at the head of her brood, send forth the most\r\nhideous scream, without being able to perceive the cause; her young ones,\r\nhowever, immediately when the warning was given skulked under the bushes,\r\nthe grass, or whatever else seemed to offer shelter or protection. They\r\neven stretched themselves at full length on the ground, and continued\r\nmotionless as if dead. In the meantime the mother, with her eyes directed\r\nupwards, continued her cries and screaming as before. On looking up in the\r\ndirection in which she seemed to gaze I discovered a black spot just under\r\nthe clouds, but was unable at first to determine what it was; however, it\r\nsoon appeared to be a bird of prey, though at first at too great a\r\ndistance to be distinguished. I have seen one of those animals continue in\r\nthis agitated state, and her whole brood pinned down, as it were, to the\r\nground for four hours together, whilst their formidable foe has taken its\r\ncircuits, has mounted and hovered directly over their heads; at last upon\r\nhis disappearing the parent changed her note and sent forth another cry,\r\nwhich in an instant gave life to the whole trembling tribe, and they all\r\nflocked round her with expressions of pleasure, as if conscious of their\r\nhappy escape from danger."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XLV.\r\n\r\nConcerts of Animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn abbot, a man of wit, and skilled in the construction of new musical\r\ninstruments, was ordered by Louis XI., King of France, more in jest than\r\nin earnest, to procure him a concert of swines\' voices. The abbot said\r\nthat the thing could doubtless be done, but that it would take a good deal\r\nof money. The king ordered that he should have whatever he required for\r\nthe purpose. The abbot then wrought a thing as singular as ever was seen;\r\nfor out of a great number of hogs of several ages which he got together,\r\nand placed under a tent, or pavilion, covered with velvet, before which he\r\nhad a table of wood painted, with a certain number of keys, he made an\r\norganical instrument, and as he played upon the said keys with little\r\nspikes, which pricked the hogs, he made them cry in such order and\r\nconsonance, he highly delighted the king and all his company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XLVI.\r\n\r\nTravellers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn innkeeper once sent, as a present by the carrier, to a friend a dog and\r\ncat tied up in a bag, who had been companions more than ten months. A\r\nshort time after the dog and cat took their departure together and\r\nreturned to their old habitation, a distance of thirteen miles. They\r\njogged along the road side by side, and on one occasion the dog gallantly\r\ndefended his fellow-traveller from the attack of another dog they met.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XLVII.\r\n\r\nThe Watch Dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nA thief who had broken into the shop of Cellini, the Florentine artist,\r\nand was breaking open the caskets in order to come at some jewels, was\r\narrested in his progress by a dog, against whom he found it a difficult\r\nmatter to defend himself with a sword. The faithful animal ran to the room\r\nwhere the journeymen slept, but as they did not seem to hear him barking\r\nhe drew away the bedclothes, and pulling them alternately by the arms,\r\nforcibly awaked them; then barking very loud he showed the way to the\r\nthief, and went on before; but the men would not follow him, and at last\r\nlocked their door. The dog having lost all hopes of the assistance of\r\nthese men undertook the task alone, and ran downstairs; he could not find\r\nthe villain in the shop, but immediately rushing into the street came up\r\nwith him, and tearing off his cloak, would have treated him according to\r\nhis deserts if the fellow had not called to some tailors in the\r\nneighbourhood, and begged they would assist him against a mad dog; the\r\ntailors believing him came to his assistance, and compelled the poor\r\nanimal to retire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XLVIII.\r\n\r\nA Shrewd Guesser.\r\n\r\n\r\nA French officer, more remarkable for his birth and spirit than his\r\nwealth, had served the Venetian republic for some years with great valour\r\nand fidelity, but had not met with that preferment which he merited. One\r\nday he waited on a nobleman whom he had often solicited in vain, but on\r\nwhose friendship he had still some reliance. The reception he met with was\r\ncool and mortifying; the nobleman turned his back upon the necessitous\r\nveteran, and left him to find his way to the street through a suite of\r\napartments magnificently furnished. He passed them lost in thought, till,\r\ncasting his eyes on a sumptuous sideboard, where a valuable collection of\r\nVenetian glass, polished and formed in the highest degree of perfection,\r\nstood on a damask cloth as a preparation for a splendid entertainment, he\r\ntook hold of a corner of the linen, and turning to a faithful English\r\nmastiff which always accompanied him, said to the animal, in a kind of\r\nabsence of mind, "Here, my poor old friend; you see how these haughty\r\ntyrants indulge themselves, and yet how we are treated!" The poor dog\r\nlooked his master in the face, and gave tokens that he understood him. The\r\nmaster walked on, but the mastiff slackened his pace, and laying hold of\r\nthe damask cloth with his teeth, at one hearty pull brought all the glass\r\non the sideboard in shivers to the ground, thus depriving the insolent\r\nnoble of his favourite exhibition of splendour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XLIX.\r\n\r\nA Tame Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\nA well-known traveller, in a description of the Island of Tristan\r\nd\'Acunha, states that the animals found on this solitary spot were so\r\ntame, that it was necessary to clear a path through the birds which were\r\nreposing on the rocks, by kicking them aside. One species of seal did not\r\nmove at all when struck or pelted, and at length some of the company\r\namused themselves by mounting them, and riding them into the sea!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE L.\r\n\r\nAn Usurper Punished.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago a sparrow had early in spring taken possession of an old\r\nswallow\'s nest, and had laid some eggs in it, when the original builder\r\nand owner of the castle made her appearance, and claimed possession. The\r\nsparrow, firmly seated, resisted the claim of the swallow; a smart battle\r\nensued, in which the swallow was joined by its mate, and during the\r\nconflict by several of their comrades. All the efforts of the assembled\r\nswallows to dislodge the usurper were, however, unsuccessful. Finding\r\nthemselves completely foiled in this object, it would seem that they had\r\nheld a council of war to consult on ulterior measures; and the resolution\r\nthey came to shows that with no ordinary degree of ingenuity some very\r\nlofty considerations of right and justice were combined in their\r\ndeliberations. Since the sparrow could not be dispossessed of the nest,\r\nthe next question with them appears to have been, how he could be\r\notherwise punished for his unlawful occupation of a property\r\nunquestionably belonging to its original constructor. The council were\r\nunanimous in thinking that nothing short of the death of the intruder\r\ncould atone for so heinous an offence; and having so decided, they\r\nproceeded to put their sentence into execution in the following very\r\nextraordinary manner. Quitting the scene of the contest for a time, they\r\nreturned with accumulated numbers, each bearing a beak full of building\r\nmaterials; and without any further attempt to beat out the sparrow, they\r\ninstantly set to work and built up the entrance into the nest, enclosing\r\nthe sparrow within the clay tenement, and leaving her to perish in the\r\nstronghold she had so bravely defended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LI.\r\n\r\nThe Rights of Hospitality.\r\n\r\n\r\nA native Moor who went to hunt the lion, having proceeded far into a\r\nforest, happened to meet with two lion\'s whelps that came to caress him;\r\nthe hunter stopped with the little animals, and waiting for the coming of\r\nthe sire or the dam, took out his breakfast, and gave them a part. The\r\nlioness arrived unperceived by the huntsman, so that he had not time, or\r\nperhaps wanted the courage, to take to his gun. After having for some time\r\nlooked at the man that was thus feasting her young, the lioness went away,\r\nand soon after returned, bearing with her a sheep, which she came and laid\r\nat the huntsman\'s feet.\r\n\r\nThe Moor, thus become one of the family, took this occasion of making a\r\ngood meal, skinned the sheep, made a fire, and roasted a part, giving the\r\nentrails to the young. The lion in his turn came also; and, as if\r\nrespecting the rights of hospitality, showed no tokens whatever of\r\nferocity. Their guest the next day, having finished his provisions,\r\nreturned, and came to a resolution never more to kill any of those\r\nanimals, the noble generosity of which he had so fully proved. He stroked\r\nand caressed the whelps at taking leave of them, and the dam and sire\r\naccompanied him till he was safely out of the forest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LII.\r\n\r\nA Grateful Lioness.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dreadful famine raged at Buenos Ayres, yet the governor, afraid of\r\ngiving the Indians a habit of spilling Spanish blood, forbade the\r\ninhabitants on pain of death to go into the fields in search of relief,\r\nplacing soldiers at all the outlets to the country, with orders to fire\r\nupon those who should attempt to transgress his orders. A woman, however,\r\ncalled Maldonata, was artful enough to elude the vigilance of the guards,\r\nand escape. After wandering about the country for a long time, she sought\r\nfor shelter in a cavern, but she had scarcely entered it when she espied a\r\nlioness, the sight of which terrified her. She was, however, soon quieted\r\nby the caresses of the animal, who, in return for a service rendered her,\r\nshowed every sign of affection and friendliness. She never returned from\r\nsearching after her own daily subsistence without laying a portion of it\r\nat the feet of Maldonata, until her whelps being strong enough to walk\r\nabroad, she took them out with her and never returned.\r\n\r\nSome time after Maldonata fell into the hands of the Spaniards, and being\r\nbrought back to Buenos Ayres on the charge of having left the city\r\ncontrary to orders, the governor, a man of cruelty, condemned the\r\nunfortunate woman to a death which none but the most cruel tyrant could\r\nhave thought of. He ordered some soldiers to take her into the country and\r\nleave her tied to a tree, either to perish by hunger, or to be torn to\r\npieces by wild beasts, as he expected. Two days after, he sent the same\r\nsoldiers to see what was become of her; when, to their great surprise,\r\nthey found her alive and unhurt, though surrounded by lions and tigers,\r\nwhich a lioness at her feet kept at some distance. As soon as the lioness\r\nperceived the soldiers, she retired a little, and enabled them to unbind\r\nMaldonata, who related to them the history of this lioness, whom she knew\r\nto be the same she had formerly assisted in the cavern. On the soldiers\r\ntaking Maldonata away, the lioness fawned upon her as unwilling to part.\r\nThe soldiers reported what they had seen to the commander, who could not\r\nbut pardon a woman who had been so singularly protected, without appearing\r\nmore inhuman than lions themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LIII.\r\n\r\nA Good Finder.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day a tradesman, walking with a friend, offered to wager that if he\r\nwere to hide a five-shilling piece in the dust, his dog would discover and\r\nbring it to him. The wager was accepted, and the piece of money marked and\r\nsecreted. When the two had proceeded some distance, the tradesman called\r\nto his dog that he had lost something, and ordered him to seek it. The dog\r\nimmediately turned back, and his master and his companion pursued their\r\nwalk. Meanwhile a traveller, driving in a small chaise, perceived the\r\npiece of money which his horse had kicked from its hiding-place, alighted,\r\ntook it up, and drove to his inn. The dog had just reached the spot in\r\nsearch of the lost piece, when the stranger picked it up. He followed the\r\nchaise, went into the inn. Having scented out the coin in the pocket of\r\nthe traveller, he leaped up at him incessantly. Supposing him to be some\r\ndog that had lost his master, the traveller regarded his movements as\r\nmarks of fondness; and as the animal was handsome, determined to keep him.\r\nHe gave him a good supper, and on retiring took him with him to his\r\nchamber. No sooner had he pulled off his breeches than they were seized by\r\nthe dog; the owner, conceiving that he wanted to play with them, took them\r\naway. The animal began to bark at the door, which the traveller opened,\r\nthinking the dog wanted to go out. The dog snatched up the breeches and\r\naway he flew, the traveller posting after him with his nightcap on. The\r\ndog ran full speed to his master\'s house, followed by the stranger, who\r\naccused the dog of robbing him. "Sir," said the master, "my dog is a very\r\nfaithful creature; and if he ran away with your breeches, it is because\r\nyou have in them money which does not belong to you." The traveller became\r\nstill more angry. "Compose yourself, sir," rejoined the other, smiling;\r\n"without doubt there is in your purse a five-shilling piece which you\r\npicked up in the road, and which I hid knowing my dog would bring it back.\r\nThis is the cause of the robbery which he has committed upon you." The\r\nstranger acknowledged the truth of the tradesman\'s statement, delivered up\r\nthe coin, and departed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LIV.\r\n\r\nMusical Seals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeals have a very delicate sense of hearing, and are much delighted with\r\nmusic. A gentleman, in his account of a voyage to Spitzbergen, mentions\r\nthat the captain of the ship\'s son, who was fond of playing on the violin,\r\nnever failed to have a numerous auditory when in the seas frequented by\r\nthese animals; and he has seen them follow the ship for miles when any\r\nperson was playing on deck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LV.\r\n\r\nA Sly Couple.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentleman in the county of Stirling kept a greyhound and a pointer, and\r\nbeing fond of coursing, the pointer was accustomed to find the hares, and\r\nthe greyhound to catch them. When the season was over, it was found that\r\nthe dogs were in the habit of going out by themselves, and killing hares\r\nfor their own amusement. To prevent this, a large iron ring was fastened\r\nto the pointer\'s neck by a leather collar, and hung down so as to prevent\r\nthe dog from running, or jumping over dykes, &c. The animals, however,\r\ncontinued to stroll out to the fields together; and one day the gentleman,\r\nsuspecting that all was not right, resolved to watch them, and to his\r\nsurprise, found that the moment when they thought that they were\r\nunobserved, the greyhound took up the iron ring in his mouth, and carrying\r\nit, they set off to the hills, and began to search for hares as usual.\r\nThey were followed, and it was observed, that whenever the pointer scented\r\nthe hare, the ring was dropped, and the greyhound stood ready to pounce\r\nupon poor puss the moment the other drove her from her form, but that he\r\nuniformly returned to assist his companion after he had caught his prey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LVI.\r\n\r\nA Sense of Ridicule.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersons who have the management of elephants have often observed that they\r\nknow very well when any one is ridiculing them, and that they very often\r\nrevenge themselves when they have an opportunity. A painter wished to draw\r\nan elephant in the menagerie at Paris in an extraordinary attitude, which\r\nwas with his trunk lifted up, and his mouth open. An attendant on the\r\npainter, to make the elephant preserve the position, threw fruits in his\r\nmouth, and often pretended to throw them without doing so. The animal\r\nbecame irritated, and as if knowing that the painter was to blame rather\r\nthan his servant, turned to him, and dashed a quantity of water from his\r\ntrunk over the paper on which the painter was sketching his distorted\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LVII.\r\n\r\nThe Tame Sea-gull.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany years ago a gentleman had accidentally caught a sea-gull, whose wings\r\nhe cut, and put it into his garden. The bird remained in that situation\r\nfor several years, and being kindly treated, became so familiar as to come\r\nat call to be fed at the kitchen door. It was known by the name of Willie.\r\nThis bird became at last so tame that no pains were taken to preserve it,\r\nand its wings having grown to full length it flew away, joined the other\r\ngulls on the beach, and came back, from time to time, to pay a visit to\r\nthe house. When its companions left the country at the usual season,\r\nWillie accompanied them, much to the regret of the family. To their great\r\njoy, however, it returned next season; and with its usual familiarity came\r\nto its old haunt, where it was welcomed and fed very liberally. In this\r\nway it went and returned for _forty years_, without intermission, and kept\r\nup its acquaintance in the most cordial manner; for while in the country\r\nit visited them almost daily, answered to its name like any domestic\r\nanimal, and ate almost out of the hand. One year, however, very near the\r\nperiod of its final disappearance, Willie did not pay his respects to the\r\nfamily for eight or ten days after the general flock of gulls were upon\r\nthe coast, and great was the lamentation for his loss, as it was feared he\r\nwas dead; but to the surprise and joy of the family, a servant one morning\r\ncame running into the breakfast-room in ecstasy, announcing that Willie\r\nhad returned. The whole company rose from the table to welcome Willie.\r\nFood was soon supplied in abundance, and Willie with his usual frankness\r\nate of it heartily, and was as tame as any barn-yard fowl about the house.\r\nIn a year or two afterwards this grateful bird discontinued his visits for\r\never.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LVIII.\r\n\r\nMaternal Affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst a ship on a voyage of discovery to the North Pole was locked in the\r\nice, one morning the man at the masthead reported that three bears were\r\nmaking their way towards the ship. They had, no doubt, been invited by the\r\nscent of some blubber of a sea-horse which the crew was burning on the ice\r\nat the time of their approach. They proved to be a she bear and her two\r\ncubs; but the cubs were nearly as large as the dam. They ran eagerly to\r\nthe fire, and drew out part of the flesh that remained unconsumed, and ate\r\nit voraciously. The crew threw great lumps of the flesh which they had\r\nstill left upon the ice, which the old bear fetched away singly, laying\r\nevery lump before the cubs as she brought it, and dividing it, gave each a\r\nshare, reserving but a small portion to herself. As she was fetching away\r\nthe last piece, they shot both the cubs dead, and wounded the dam, but not\r\nmortally. It would have drawn tears of pity from any but the most\r\nunfeeling to have marked the affectionate concern of this poor animal in\r\nthe dying moments of her expiring young. Though sorely wounded, she\r\ncrawled to the place where they lay, carrying a lump of flesh she had just\r\nfetched away, tore it in pieces, and laid it down before them; when she\r\nsaw that they refused to eat, she laid her paws first upon one, then upon\r\nthe other, and endeavoured to raise them up, making at the same time the\r\nmost pitiable moans. Finding she could not stir them, she went off, and\r\nwhen she had got at some distance, looked back and moaned; and that not\r\navailing to entice them away, she returned, and smelling round them, began\r\nto lick their wounds. She went off a second time, and having crawled a few\r\npaces, looked again behind her, and for some time stood moaning. But her\r\ncubs not rising to follow her, she returned, and with signs of\r\ninexpressible fondness went round them, pawing them successively. Finding\r\nat last that they were cold and lifeless, she raised her head towards the\r\nship, and growled a curse upon the destroyers, which they returned with a\r\nvolley of musket-balls. She fell between her cubs, and died licking their\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LIX.\r\n\r\nThe Pig Pointer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA sow, which was a thin, long-legged animal (one of the ugliest of the New\r\nForest breed), when very young conceived so great a partiality to some\r\npointer puppies that a gamekeeper upon a neighbouring estate was breaking,\r\nthat it played, and often came to feed with them. From this circumstance\r\nit occurred to the gamekeeper that, having broken many a dog as obstinate\r\nas a pig, he would try if he could not also succeed in breaking a pig. The\r\nlittle animal would often go out with the puppies to some distance from\r\nhome; and he enticed it farther by a sort of pudding made of barley-meal,\r\nwhich he carried in one of his pockets. The other he filled with stones,\r\nwhich he threw at the pig whenever she misbehaved, as he was not able to\r\ncatch and correct her in the same manner he did his dogs. He found the\r\nanimal tractable, and soon taught her what he wished by this mode of\r\nreward and punishment. They were frequently seen out together, when the\r\nsow quartered her ground as regularly as any pointer, stood when she came\r\non game (having an excellent nose), and backed other dogs as well as he\r\never saw a pointer. When she came on the cold scent of game, she slackened\r\nher trot, and gradually dropped her ears and tail, till she was certain,\r\nand then fell down on her knees. So staunch was she, that she would\r\nfrequently remain five minutes and upwards on her point. As soon as the\r\ngame rose, she always returned to her master, grunting very loudly for her\r\nreward of pudding if it was not immediately given to her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LX.\r\n\r\nInfant Fascination.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little girl about three years of age was observed for a number of days\r\nto go to a considerable distance from the house with a piece of bread\r\nwhich she obtained from her mother. The circumstance attracted the\r\nattention of the mother, who desired her husband to follow the child, and\r\nobserve what she did with it. On coming to the child, he found her engaged\r\nin feeding several snakes, called yellow heads, a species of rattlesnake.\r\nHe immediately took her away and proceeded to the house for his gun, and\r\nreturning, killed two of them at one shot, and another a few days after.\r\nThe child called these reptiles in the manner of calling chickens; and\r\nwhen her father observed, if she continued the practice they would bite\r\nher, the child replied, "No, father, they won\'t bite me; they only eat the\r\nbread I give them."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXI.\r\n\r\nA Domesticated Seal.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentleman once succeeded in taming a seal. It appeared to possess all\r\nthe sagacity of the dog, lived in its master\'s house, and ate from his\r\nhand. He usually took it with him in his fishing excursions, upon which\r\noccasions it afforded no small entertainment. When thrown into the water,\r\nit would follow for miles the track of the boat; and although thrust back\r\nby the oars, it never relinquished its purpose. Indeed, it struggled so\r\nhard to regain its seat, that one would imagine its fondness for its\r\nmaster had entirely overcome the natural predilection for its native\r\nelement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXII.\r\n\r\nRetribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a park a fawn, drinking, was suddenly pounced upon by one of the swans,\r\nwhich pulled the animal into the water, and held it under until quite\r\ndrowned. The atrocious action was observed by the other deer in the park,\r\nand did not long go unrevenged; for shortly after this very swan, which\r\nhad hitherto never been molested by the deer, was singled out when on\r\nland, and furiously attacked by a herd, which surrounded and presently\r\nkilled the offender.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXIII.\r\n\r\nStrange Rooks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a large north of England town a pair of strange rooks, after an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to effect a lodgment in a rookery at a little\r\ndistance from the Exchange, were compelled to abandon the attempt, and to\r\ntake refuge on the spire of a building; and although constantly molested\r\nby other rooks, they built their nest on the top of the vane, and there\r\nreared a brood of young ones, undisturbed by the noise of the populace\r\nbelow them. The nest and its inmates were of course turned about by every\r\nchange of the wind. For ten years they continued to build their nest in\r\nthe same place, soon after which the spire was taken down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXIV.\r\n\r\nA Singular Foster-Mother.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn an estate in Scotland a terrier had a litter of whelps, which were\r\nimmediately taken from her and drowned. The unfortunate mother was quite\r\ndisconsolate, until, a few weeks after, she perceived a brood of\r\nducklings, which she immediately seized and carried to her lair, where she\r\nretained them, following them out and in with the greatest care, and\r\nnursing them after her own fashion, with the most affectionate anxiety.\r\nWhen the ducklings, following their natural instinct, went into the water,\r\ntheir foster-mother exhibited the utmost alarm; and as soon as they\r\nreturned to land, she snatched them up in her mouth, and ran home with\r\nthem. What adds to the singularity of this circumstance is, that the same\r\nanimal, when deprived of a litter of puppies the year preceding, seized\r\ntwo cock-chickens, which she reared with the like care she bestows upon\r\nher present family. When the young cocks began to try their voices, their\r\nfoster-mother was as much annoyed as she now seems to be by the swimming\r\nof the ducklings--and never failed to repress their attempts at crowing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXV.\r\n\r\nThe Shepherd\'s Dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Hogg, the shepherd poet, had a dog named Sirrah, who was for many\r\nyears his sole companion. He was, the shepherd says, the best dog he ever\r\nsaw, in spite of his surly manners and unprepossessing appearance. The\r\nfirst time he saw the dog, a drover was leading him by a rope, and,\r\nalthough hungry and lean, "I thought," Hogg tells us, "I discovered a sort\r\nof sullen intelligence in his face, so I gave the drover a guinea for him.\r\nI believe there never was a guinea so well laid out. He was scarcely then\r\na year old, and knew nothing of herding; but as soon as he discovered that\r\nit was his duty to do so, I can never forget with what eagerness he\r\nlearned. He would try every way till he found out what I wanted him to do;\r\nand when once I made him to understand a direction, he never forgot or\r\nmistook it again."\r\n\r\nAbout seven hundred lambs, which were at once under Mr. Hogg\'s care, broke\r\nup at midnight, and scampered off in three divisions across the hills, in\r\nspite of all that the shepherd and an assistant lad could do to keep them\r\ntogether. "Sirrah," cried the shepherd, in great affliction, "my man,\r\nthey\'re a\' awa." The night was so dark that he did not see Sirrah; but the\r\nfaithful animal had heard his master\'s words, and without more ado he set\r\noff in quest of the flock. The shepherd and his companion spent the whole\r\nnight in scouring the hills, but of neither the lambs nor Sirrah could\r\nthey obtain the slightest trace. "We had nothing for it," says the\r\nshepherd, "but to return to our master, and inform him that we had lost\r\nhis whole flock of lambs. On our way home, however, we discovered a body\r\nof lambs at the bottom of a deep ravine, and Sirrah standing in front of\r\nthem, looking all around for some relief. We concluded that it was one of\r\nthe divisions of the lambs which Sirrah had been unable to manage until he\r\ncame to that commanding situation. But what was our astonishment when we\r\ndiscovered by degrees that not one was wanting! How he had got all the\r\ndivisions collected in the dark is beyond my comprehension. I never felt\r\nso grateful to any creature below the sun as I did to my honest Sirrah\r\nthat morning."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXVI.\r\n\r\nForaging.\r\n\r\n\r\nA constable once made a complaint before a bench of London magistrates\r\nagainst a horse for stealing hay. The complainant stated that the horse\r\ncame regularly every night of its own accord, and without any attendant,\r\nto the coach-stands in St. George\'s, fully satisfied his appetite, and\r\nthen galloped away. He defied the whole of the parish officers to\r\napprehend him; for if they attempted to go near him while he was eating,\r\nhe would throw up his heels and kick at them, or run at them, and if they\r\ndid not go out of the way, he would bite them. The constable therefore\r\nthought it best to represent the case to the magistrates.\r\n\r\n_One of the Magistrates:_ "Well, Mr. Constable, if you should be annoyed\r\nagain by this animal in the execution of your duty, you may apprehend him\r\nif you can, and bring him before us to answer your complaints."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXVII.\r\n\r\nGoing to Market.\r\n\r\n\r\nA butcher and cattle dealer had a dog which he usually took with him when\r\nhe drove cattle to the market, at a town some nine miles distant from his\r\nhome, to be sold, and who displayed uncommon dexterity in managing them.\r\nAt last, so convinced was the master of the sagacity, as well as the\r\nfidelity of his dog, that he made a wager that he would entrust him with a\r\nfixed number of sheep and oxen to drive alone to market. It was stipulated\r\nthat no person should be within sight or hearing, who had the least\r\ncontrol over the dog; nor was any spectator to interfere, or be within a\r\nquarter of a mile. On the day of trial, the dog proceeded with his\r\nbusiness in the most dexterous and steady manner; and although he had\r\nfrequently to drive his charge through the herds who were grazing, yet he\r\nnever lost one, but conducting them into the very yard to which he was\r\nused to drive them when with his master, he significantly delivered them\r\nup to the person appointed to receive them, by barking at the door. What\r\nmore particularly marked the dog\'s sagacity was, that when the path the\r\nherd travelled lay through a spot where others were grazing, he would run\r\nforward, stop his own drove, and then driving the others from each side of\r\nthe path, collect his scattered charge and proceed. He was several times\r\nafterwards thus sent alone for the amusement of the curious or the\r\nconvenience of his master, and always acquitted himself in the same adroit\r\nand intelligent manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe Lion and his Keeper.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a large continental menagerie there was a lion called Danco, whose cage\r\nwas in want of some repairs. His keeper desired a carpenter to set about\r\nit, but when the workman came and saw the lion, he started back with\r\nterror. The keeper entered the animal\'s cage, and led him to the upper\r\npart of it, while the lower was refitting. He there amused himself for\r\nsome time playing with the lion, and being wearied, he soon fell asleep.\r\nThe carpenter, fully relying upon the vigilance of the keeper, pursued his\r\nwork with rapidity, and when he had finished, he called him to see what\r\nwas done. The keeper made no answer. Having repeatedly called in vain, he\r\nbegan to feel alarmed at his situation, and he determined to go to the\r\nupper part of the cage, where, looking through the railing, he saw the\r\nlion and the keeper sleeping side by side. He immediately uttered a loud\r\ncry; the lion, awakened by the noise, started up and stared at the\r\ncarpenter with an eye of fury, and then, placing his paw on the breast of\r\nhis keeper, lay down to sleep again. At length the keeper was awakened by\r\nsome of the attendants, and he did not appear in the least apprehensive on\r\naccount of the situation in which he found himself, but shook the lion by\r\nthe paw, and then gently conducted him to his former residence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXIX.\r\n\r\nImmovable Fidelity.\r\n\r\n\r\nA dog, between the breed of a mastiff and a bull-dog, belonging to a\r\nchimney-sweeper, laid, according to his master\'s orders, on a soot-bag,\r\nwhich he had placed inadvertently almost in the middle of a narrow back\r\nstreet, in a town in the south of England. A loaded cart passing by, the\r\ndriver desired the dog to move out of the way. On refusing he was scolded,\r\nthen beaten, first gently, and afterwards with the smart application of\r\nthe cart-whip; all to no purpose. The fellow, with an oath, threatened to\r\ndrive over the dog--he did so, and the faithful animal, in endeavouring to\r\narrest the progress of the wheel by biting it, was crushed to pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXX.\r\n\r\nTame Hares.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hare is scarcely a domestic animal; yet we have an account of one who\r\nwas so domesticated as to feed from the hand, lay under a chair in a\r\ncommon sitting-room, and appear in every other respect as easy and\r\ncomfortable in its situation as a lapdog. It now and then went out into\r\nthe garden, but after regaling itself with the fresh air, always returned\r\nto the house as its proper habitation. Its usual companions were a\r\ngreyhound and spaniel, with whom it spent its evenings, the whole three\r\nsporting and sleeping together on the same hearth. What makes the\r\ncircumstance more remarkable is, that the greyhound and spaniel were both\r\nso fond of hare-hunting, that they used often to go out coursing together,\r\nwithout any person accompanying them; they were like the "_sly couple_",\r\nof whose devotion to the chase an amusing instance has been already\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nA traveller once brought a young hare to such a degree of frolicsome\r\nfamiliarity, that it would run and jump about his sofa and bed; leap upon,\r\nand pat him with its fore feet; or whilst he was reading, knock the book\r\nout of his hands, as if to claim, like a fondled child, the exclusive\r\npreference of his attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXI.\r\n\r\nA Grateful Return.\r\n\r\n\r\nA favourite house-dog, left to the care of its master\'s servants, while he\r\nwas himself away, would have been starved by them if it had not had\r\nrecourse to the kitchen of a friend of its master\'s, which in better days\r\nit had occasionally visited. On the return of the master it enjoyed plenty\r\nat home, and stood in no further need of the liberality it experienced;\r\nbut still it did not forget that hospitable kitchen where it had found a\r\nresource in adversity. A few days after, the dog fell in with a duck,\r\nwhich, as he found in no private pond, he probably concluded to be no\r\nprivate property. He snatched up the duck in his teeth, carried it to the\r\nkitchen where he had been so hospitably fed, laid it at the cook\'s feet,\r\nwith many polite movements of the tail, and then scampered off with much\r\nseeming complacency at having given this testimony of his grateful sense\r\nof favours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXII.\r\n\r\nAssisting the Aged.\r\n\r\n\r\nA captain of cavalry in a French regiment mentions that a horse belonging\r\nto his company, being from age unable to eat his hay or grind his oats,\r\nwas fed for two months by two horses on his right and left, who ate with\r\nhim. These two horses, drawing the hay out of the rack, chewed it, and\r\nthen put it before the old horse, and did the same with the oats, which he\r\nwas then able to eat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXIII.\r\n\r\nOyster Opening.\r\n\r\n\r\nA well-known traveller relates a circumstance concerning the orang-otang\r\nin its wild state, which is indicative of very considerable powers, both\r\nof reflection and invention. When the fruits on the mountains are\r\nexhausted, they will frequently descend to the sea-coast, where they feed\r\non various species of shell-fish, but in particular on a large sort of\r\noyster, which commonly lies open on the shore. "Fearful," he says, "of\r\nputting in their paws, lest the oyster should close and crush them, they\r\ninsert a stone as a wedge within the shell; this prevents it from closing,\r\nand they then drag out their prey, and devour it at leisure."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXIV.\r\n\r\nSonnini and his Cat.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Sonnini, when in Egypt, had an Angora cat, of which he was extremely\r\nfond. It was entirely covered with long white silken hairs; its tail\r\nformed a magnificent plume, which the animal elevated at pleasure over its\r\nbody. Not one spot, nor a single dark shade, tarnished the dazzling white\r\nof its coat. Its nose and lips were of a delicate rose colour. Two large\r\neyes sparkled in its round head: one was of a light yellow, and the other\r\nof a fine blue.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful animal had even more loveliness of manners than grace in\r\nits attitude and movements. However ill any one used her, she never\r\nattempted to advance her claws from their sheaths. Sensible to kindness,\r\nshe licked the hand which caressed, and even that which tormented her. In\r\nSonnini\'s solitary moments, she chiefly kept by his side; she interrupted\r\nhim often in the midst of his labours or meditations, by little caresses\r\nextremely touching, and generally followed him in his walks. During his\r\nabsence she sought and called for him incessantly. She recognised his\r\nvoice at a distance, and seemed on each fresh meeting with him to feel\r\nincreased delight.\r\n\r\n"This animal," says Sonnini, "was my principal amusement for several\r\nyears. How was the expression of attachment depicted upon her countenance!\r\nHow many times have her caresses made me forget my troubles, and consoled\r\nme in my misfortunes! My beautiful and interesting companion, however, at\r\nlength perished. After several days of suffering, during which I never\r\nforsook her, her eyes, constantly fixed on me, were at length\r\nextinguished; and her loss rent my heart with sorrow."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXV.\r\n\r\nDivision of Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Alpine marmots are said to act in concert in the collection of\r\nmaterials for the construction of their habitations. Some of them, we are\r\ntold, cut the herbage, others collect it into heaps; a third set serve as\r\nwaggons to carry it to their holes; while others perform all the functions\r\nof draught horses. The manner of the latter part of the curious process is\r\nthis. The animal who is to serve as the waggon lies down on his back, and\r\nextending his four limbs as wide as he can, allows himself to be loaded\r\nwith hay; and those who are to be the draught horses trail him thus loaded\r\nby the tail, taking care not to overset him. The task of thus serving as\r\nthe vehicle being evidently the least enviable part of the business, is\r\ntaken by every one of the party in turn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXVI.\r\n\r\nCrab Fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is an instance of the extraordinary cunning manifested by\r\nthe Racoon. It is fond of crabs, and when in quest of them, will stand by\r\nthe side of a swamp, and hang its tail over into the water; the crabs,\r\nmistaking it for food, are sure to lay hold of it; and as soon as the\r\nbeast feels them pinch, he pulls them out with a sudden jerk. He then\r\ntakes them to a little distance from the water\'s edge; and in devouring\r\nthem, is careful to get them crossways in his mouth, lest he should suffer\r\nfrom their nippers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXVII.\r\n\r\nRare Honesty.\r\n\r\n\r\nA mastiff dog, who owed more to the bounty of a neighbour than to his\r\nmaster, was once locked by mistake in the well-stored pantry of his\r\nbenefactor for a whole day, where milk, butter, bread, and meat, within\r\nhis reach, were in abundance. On the return of the servant to the pantry,\r\nseeing the dog come out, and knowing the time he had been confined, she\r\ntrembled for the devastation which her negligence must have occasioned;\r\nbut on close examination, it was found that the honest creature had not\r\ntasted of anything, although, on coming out, he fell on a bone that was\r\ngiven to him, with all the voraciousness of hunger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXVIII.\r\n\r\nOf Two Evils Choosing the Least.\r\n\r\n\r\nA French dog was taught by his master to execute various commissions, and\r\namong others, to fetch him victuals from a restaurant in a basket. One\r\nevening when the dog was returning to his master thus furnished, two other\r\ndogs, attracted by the savoury smell issuing from the basket, determined\r\nto attack him. The dog put his basket on the ground, and set himself\r\ncourageously against the first that advanced against him; but while he was\r\nengaged with the one, the other ran to the basket, and began to help\r\nhimself. At length, seeing that there was no chance of beating both dogs,\r\nand saving his master\'s dinner, he threw himself between his two\r\nopponents, and without further ceremony, quickly despatched the remainder\r\nof the victuals himself, and then returned to his master with the empty\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXIX.\r\n\r\nSnake Destroyers.\r\n\r\nThe Indian ichneumon, a small creature in appearance between the weasel\r\nand the mangoose, is of infinite use to the natives from its inveterate\r\nenmity to snakes, which would otherwise render every footstep of the\r\ntraveller dangerous. This diminutive creature, on seeing a snake ever so\r\nlarge, will instantly dart on it, and seize it by the throat, provided he\r\nfinds himself in an open place, where he has an opportunity of running to\r\na certain herb, which he knows instinctively to be an antidote against the\r\npoison of the bite, if he should happen to receive one. A gentleman\r\nvisiting the island of Ceylon saw the experiment tried in a closed room,\r\nwhere the ichneumon, instead of attacking his enemy, did all in his power\r\nto avoid him. On being carried out of the house, however, and laid near\r\nhis antagonist in the plantation, he immediately darted at the snake, and\r\nsoon destroyed it. It then suddenly disappeared for a few minutes, and\r\nagain returned, as soon as it had found the herb and ate it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXX.\r\n\r\nMonkey versus Snake.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe monkeys in India, knowing by instinct the malignity of the snakes, are\r\nmost vigilant in their destruction; they seize them when asleep by the\r\nneck, and running to the nearest flat stone, grind down the head by a\r\nstrong friction on the surface, frequently looking at it, and grinning at\r\ntheir progress. When convinced that the venomous fangs are destroyed, they\r\ntoss the reptiles to their young ones to play with, and seem to rejoice in\r\nthe destruction of their common enemy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXXI.\r\n\r\nMusical Mice.\r\n\r\n\r\n"One rainy winter evening, as I was alone in my chamber," relates an\r\nAmerican gentleman, "I took up my flute and commenced playing. In a few\r\nminutes my attention was directed to a mouse that I saw creeping from a\r\nhole, and advancing to the chair in which I was sitting. I ceased playing,\r\nand it ran precipitately back to its hole; I began again shortly\r\nafterwards, and was much surprised to see it reappear, and take its old\r\nposition. The appearance of the little animal was truly delightful; it\r\ncouched itself on the floor, shut its eyes, and appeared in ecstasy; I\r\nceased playing, and it instantly disappeared again. This experiment I\r\nrepeated frequently with the same success, observing that it was always\r\ndifferently affected, as the music varied from the slow and plaintive, to\r\nthe brisk or lively. It finally went off, and all my art could not entice\r\nit to return."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXXII.\r\n\r\nSoliciting Succour.\r\n\r\n\r\nA party of a ship\'s crew being sent ashore on a part of the coast of\r\nIndia, for the purpose of cutting wood for the ship, one of the men having\r\nstrayed from the rest was greatly frightened by the appearance of a large\r\nlioness, who made towards him; but on her coming up, she lay down at his\r\nfeet, and looked very earnestly first at him, and then at a tree a short\r\ndistance off. After repeating her looks several times, she arose, and\r\nproceeded onwards to the tree, looking back several times, as if wishing\r\nthe man to follow her. At length he ventured, and coming to the tree, he\r\nperceived a huge baboon with two young cubs in her arms, which he supposed\r\nwere those of the lioness, as she couched down like a cat, and seemed to\r\neye them very steadfastly. The man being afraid to ascend the tree,\r\ndecided on cutting it down, and having his axe with him, he set actively\r\nto work, when the lioness seemed most attentive to what he was doing. When\r\nthe tree fell, she sprung upon the baboon, and after tearing him in\r\npieces, she turned round and licked the cubs for some time. She then\r\nturned to the man and fawned round him, rubbing her head against him in\r\ngreat fondness, and in token of her gratitude for the service he had done\r\nher. After this, she took the cubs away one by one, and the man returned\r\nto the ship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXXIII.\r\n\r\nA Charitable Canary.\r\n\r\n\r\nA pair of goldfinches who had the misfortune to be captured, together with\r\ntheir nest and six young ones, were placed in a double cage, with a pair\r\nof canaries, which had a brood of young; there was a division of wirework\r\nbetween the cages. At first the goldfinches seemed careless about their\r\nyoung ones; but the cock canary, attracted by their cries, forced itself\r\nthrough a flaw in the wires, and began to feed them; an operation which it\r\ncontinued regularly, until the goldfinches undertook the office\r\nthemselves, and rendered the humanity of the canary no longer necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXXIV.\r\n\r\nPugnacity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town of Bindrabund in India is in high estimation with the pious\r\nHindoos, who resort to it from the most remote parts of the empire. The\r\ntown is surrounded by groves of trees, which are the residence of\r\ninnumerable apes, whose propensity to mischief is increased by the\r\nreligious respect paid to them in honour of a divinity of the Hindoo\r\nmythology, who is represented as possessing the body of an ape. In\r\nconsequence of this superstition, such numbers of these animals are\r\nsupported by the voluntary contributions of pilgrims, that no one dares to\r\nresist or ill-treat them. Hence, access to the town is often difficult;\r\nfor should one of the apes take a dislike to any unlucky traveller, he is\r\nsure to be assailed by the whole community, who follow him with all the\r\nmissile weapons they can collect, as pieces of bamboo, stones, and dirt,\r\nmaking at the same time a most hideous howling. Of the danger attending a\r\nmeeting with enemies of this description, the following is a melancholy\r\ninstance. Two young cavalry officers, belonging to the Bengal army, having\r\noccasion to pass this way, were attacked by a body of apes, at whom one of\r\nthe gentlemen inadvertently fired. The alarm instantly drew the whole\r\nbody, with the fakeers, out of the place, with so much fury, that the\r\nofficers, though mounted upon elephants, were compelled to seek their\r\nsafety in flight; and in endeavouring to pass the Jumna, they both\r\nperished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXXV.\r\n\r\nA Carrier\'s Dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nA carrier on his way to a market town had occasion to stop at some houses\r\nby the road side, in the way of his business, leaving his cart and horse\r\nupon the public road, under the protection of a passenger and a trusty\r\ndog. Upon his return he missed a led horse, belonging to a gentleman in\r\nthe neighbourhood, which he had tied to the end of the cart, and likewise\r\none of the female passengers. On inquiry he was informed that during his\r\nabsence the female, who had been anxious to try the mettle of the pony,\r\nhad mounted it, and that the animal had set off at full speed. The carrier\r\nexpressed much anxiety for the safety of the young woman, casting at the\r\nsame time an expressive look at his dog. Oscar observed his master\'s eye,\r\nand aware of its meaning, instantly set off in pursuit of the pony, which\r\ncoming up with soon after, he made a sudden spring, seized the bridle, and\r\nheld the animal fast. Several people having observed the circumstance, and\r\nthe perilous situation of the girl, came to relieve her. Oscar, however,\r\nnotwithstanding their repeated endeavours, would not quit his hold, and\r\nthe pony was actually led into the stable with the dog, till such time as\r\nthe carrier should arrive. Upon the carrier entering the stable, Oscar\r\nwagged his tail in token of satisfaction, and immediately relinquished the\r\nbridle to his master.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXXVI.\r\n\r\nHumane Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nA large colony of rooks had resided many years in a grove on the banks of\r\na river. One serene evening the idle members amused themselves with\r\nchasing each other through endless mazes, and in their flight they made\r\nthe air sound with an infinitude of discordant noises. In the midst of\r\nthese playful exertions it unfortunately happened that one rook, by a\r\nsudden turn, struck his beak against the wing of another. The sufferer\r\ninstantly fell into the river. A general cry of distress ensued. The birds\r\nhovered with every expression of anxiety over their distressed companion.\r\n\r\nAnimated by their sympathy, and perhaps by the language of counsel known\r\nto themselves, he sprang into the air, and by one strong effort reached\r\nthe point of a rock that projected into the river. The joy became loud and\r\nuniversal; but, alas! it was soon changed into notes of lamentation, for\r\nthe poor wounded bird, in attempting to fly towards his nest, dropped\r\nagain into the river and was drowned, amid the moans of his whole\r\nfraternity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXXVII.\r\n\r\nFox Chasing.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring a fox hunt, Reynard, being hard pressed, was reduced to the\r\nnecessity of taking refuge up a chimney of a hothouse. He was followed by\r\none of the hounds, who, passing through a flue upwards of fifty feet in\r\nlength, came out at the top of the chimney, but missed Reynard in its\r\nmurky recess. By this time a number of people were collected at the top of\r\nthe chimney, who let down a terrier, who soon made him come in view,\r\nholding fast by his brush.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXXVIII.\r\n\r\nEscape of Jengis Khan.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mogul and Kalmuc Tartars attribute to the white owl the preservation\r\nof Jengis Khan, the founder of their empire; and they pay it on that\r\naccount almost divine honours. The prince, with a small army, happened to\r\nbe surprised and put to flight by his enemies. Forced to seek concealment\r\nin a coppice, an owl settled on the bush under which he was hid. At the\r\nsight of this animal the prince\'s pursuers never thought of searching the\r\nspot, conceiving it impossible that such a bird would perch where any\r\nhuman being was concealed. Jengis escaped, and ever after his countrymen\r\nheld the white owl sacred, and every one wore a plume of its feathers on\r\nhis head. The Kalmucs continue the custom to this day, at all their great\r\nfestivals; and some tribes have an idol in the form of an owl, to which\r\nthey fasten the real legs of this bird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE LXXXIX.\r\n\r\nA Refugee Squirrel.\r\n\r\n\r\nA squirrel, whose bad luck it was to be captured, was lodged for safe\r\ncustody in a trap used for taking rats alive. Here he remained for several\r\nweeks, till at length, panting for liberty, he contrived to make his\r\nescape through a window, and repaired once more to his native fields. The\r\nfamily in which he had been a sportive inmate, were not a little vexed at\r\nthe loss of their little favourite, and the servant was ordered in the\r\nevening of the same day to remove the trap, that they might no longer be\r\nreminded of their loss; but on proceeding to discharge his duty, he found\r\nto his surprise that the squirrel, all wet and ruffled by the storm, had\r\nreassumed his station, and again taken up his lodgings in a corner of the\r\ntrap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XC.\r\n\r\nRetaliation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA wild stork was brought by a farmer into his poultry yard to be the\r\ncompanion of a tame one, which he had long kept there; but the tame stork,\r\ndisliking a rival, fell upon the poor stranger, and beat him so\r\nunmercifully that he was compelled to take wing, and with some difficulty\r\nescaped. About four months afterwards, however, he returned to the poultry\r\nyard, recovered of his wounds, and attended by three other storks, who no\r\nsooner alighted, than they all together fell upon the tame stork, and\r\nkilled him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XCI.\r\n\r\nA Newsman Extraordinary.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the carriers of a large newspaper having become indisposed, his son\r\ntook his place; but not knowing the subscribers he was to supply, he took\r\nfor his guide a dog which had usually attended his father. The animal\r\ntrotted on a-head of the boy, and stopped at every door where the paper\r\nwas in use to be left, without making a single omission or mistake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XCII.\r\n\r\nThe Bear Cubs.\r\n\r\n\r\nA female bear, with two cubs, approached near a whaler, and was shot. The\r\ncubs not attempting to escape, were taken alive. These animals, though at\r\nfirst evidently very unhappy, became at length in some measure reconciled\r\nto their situation, and being tolerably tame, were allowed occasionally to\r\ngo at large about the deck. While the ship was moored to a floe, a few\r\ndays after they were taken, one of them having a rope fastened round his\r\nneck, was thrown overboard. It immediately swam to the ice, got upon it,\r\nand attempted to escape. Finding itself, however, detained by the rope, it\r\nendeavoured to disengage itself in the following ingenious way. Near the\r\nedge of the floe was a crack in the ice of considerable length, but only\r\neighteen inches or two feet wide, and three or four feet deep. To this\r\nspot the bear turned; and when, on crossing the chasm, the bight of the\r\nrope fell into it, he placed himself across the opening; then suspending\r\nhimself by his hind feet, with a leg on each side, he dropped his head and\r\nmost part of his body into the chasm; and with a foot applied to each side\r\nof the neck, attempted for some minutes to push the rope over his head.\r\nFinding this scheme ineffectual, he removed to the main ice, and running\r\nwith great impetuosity from the ship, gave a remarkable pull on the rope;\r\nthen going backward a few steps, he repeated the jerk. At length, after\r\nrepeated attempts to escape this way, every failure of which he announced\r\nby a significant growl, he yielded himself to his hard necessity, and lay\r\ndown on the ice in angry and sullen silence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XCIII.\r\n\r\nNoble Perseverance.\r\n\r\n\r\nElephants were, of old, employed in India in the launching of ships. It is\r\nrelated of one, that, being directed to force a very large vessel into the\r\nwater, the work proved superior to its strength; his master, with\r\nsarcastic tone, bid the keeper take away the lazy beast, and bring\r\nanother: the poor animal instantly repeated his efforts, fractured his\r\nskull, and died on the spot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XCIV.\r\n\r\nThe Catcher Caught.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring a sudden inundation of the Rhine, a hare, unable to escape through\r\nthe water to an eminence, climbed up a tree. One of the boatmen rowing\r\nabout to assist the unfortunate inhabitants, observing puss, rowed up to\r\nthe tree, and mounted it, eager for the game, without properly fastening\r\nhis boat. The terrified hare, on the approach of its pursuer, sprang from\r\nthe branch into the boat, which thus set in motion floated away, leaving\r\nits owner in the tree in dread of being washed away by the current. After\r\nseveral hours\' anxiety, he was perceived, and taken off by some of his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XCV.\r\n\r\nDeceiving the Fowler.\r\n\r\n\r\nA young pointer, out with his master hunting, ran on a brood of very small\r\npartridges. The old bird cried, fluttered, and ran trembling along just\r\nbefore the dog\'s nose, till she had drawn him to a considerable distance;\r\nwhen she took wing and flew farther off, but not out of the field. On this\r\nthe dog returned nearly to the place where the young ones lay concealed in\r\nthe grass; which the old bird no sooner perceived, than she flew back\r\nagain, settled first before the dog\'s nose, and a second time acted the\r\nsame part, rolling and tumbling about till she drew off his attention from\r\nthe brood, and thus succeeded in preserving them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XCVI.\r\n\r\nOld Habits.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn eminent Scotch lawyer, having cause to visit London, decided to perform\r\nthe journey on horseback in preference to posting, for this was before the\r\ndays of railways. He therefore purchased a horse before starting, and on\r\nhis arrival at the metropolis, following the usual custom, disposed of his\r\nnag, deciding to purchase another for the return journey. When he had\r\ncompleted his business, and had decided to set out for home, he went to\r\nSmithfield to purchase a horse. About dusk, a handsome horse was offered\r\nto him at so cheap a rate, that he was led to suspect the animal to be\r\nunsound; but as he could discover no blemish he became the purchaser. Next\r\nmorning he set out on his journey; his horse had excellent paces, and the\r\nfirst few miles, while the road was well frequented, our traveller spent\r\nin congratulating himself on his good fortune. On Finchley Common the\r\ntraveller met a clergyman driving a one-horse chaise. There was nobody\r\nwithin sight, and the horse by his manoeuvre plainly intimated what had\r\nbeen the profession of his former master. Instead of passing the chaise,\r\nhe laid his counter close up to it, and stopped it, having no doubt that\r\nhis rider would embrace so fair an opportunity of exercising his vocation.\r\nThe clergyman, under the same mistake, produced his purse unasked, and\r\nassured the inoffensive and surprised horseman that it was unnecessary to\r\ndraw his pistol. The traveller rallied his horse, with apologies to the\r\ngentleman, whom he had unwillingly affrighted, and pursued his journey.\r\nThe horse next made the same suspicious approach to a coach, from the\r\nwindows of which a blunderbuss was levelled, with denunciations of death\r\nand destruction to the rider, who was innocent of all offence in deed or\r\nword. In short, after his life had been once or twice endangered by the\r\nsuspicions to which his horse\'s conduct gave rise, and his liberty as\r\noften threatened by peace officers, who were disposed to apprehend him as\r\na notorious highwayman, he found himself obliged to part with the animal\r\nfor a mere trifle, and to purchase at a dearer rate a horse of less\r\nexternal figure and action, but of better moral habits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XCVII.\r\n\r\nA Philosophic Cat.\r\n\r\n\r\nA young cat, which sometimes was permitted the indulgence of taking her\r\nplace in the domestic circle, upon the carpet before the fire in the\r\nparlour, one day came in when one of the party was spinning upon a line\r\nwheel. Having never seen such a thing before, she became extremely alarmed\r\nby its appearance and motion. She couched down in an attitude of fear and\r\nof investigation; and yet at such a distance as would admit of a speedy\r\nretreat if it should prove to be alive, and an enemy. She crept slowly all\r\nalong the wheel, with her eyes steadily fixed on it, and with a very\r\nsingular expression of countenance, till at length, not being able to\r\nsatisfy herself, she retreated towards the door, impatiently waiting to\r\nmake her escape; which she did the moment it was in her power, with great\r\nprecipitation.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when she came into the room, the wheel then standing\r\nstill, she advanced courageously towards it, and after an apparently\r\ncareful examination, walking all round, ventured upon the further\r\nexperiment of endeavouring to ascertain with her paw whether there was\r\nreally anything to be apprehended from it. Still not finding any motion,\r\nour philosopher of the Newtonian school, satisfied that she had nothing to\r\nfear, seated herself quietly by the fire; and the next time she saw it in\r\nmotion, she sprang gaily forward, and enjoyed her triumph, by playing with\r\nthe object of her former terror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XCVIII.\r\n\r\nAn Ass Cast Away.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ass, belonging to a captain in the Royal Navy, then at Malta, was\r\nshipped on board a frigate, bound from Gibraltar for that island. The\r\nvessel struck on some sands off the Point de Gat, and the ass was thrown\r\noverboard, in the hope that it might possibly be able to swim to the land;\r\nof which, however, there seemed but little chance, for the sea was running\r\nso high, that a boat which left the ship was lost. A few days after, when\r\nthe gates of Gibraltar were opened in the morning, the guard were\r\nsurprised by Valiant, as the ass was called, presenting himself for\r\nadmittance. On entering, he proceeded immediately to the stable of a\r\nmerchant, which he had formerly occupied. The poor animal had not only\r\nswam safely to the shore, but without guide, compass, or travelling map,\r\nhad found his way from Point de Gat to Gibraltar, a distance of more than\r\ntwo hundred miles, through a mountainous and intricate country,\r\nintersected by streams, which he had never traversed before, and in so\r\nshort a period, that he could not have made one false turn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE XCIX.\r\n\r\nHonours Paid to Living and Departed Worth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Athens, when they had finished the temple called\r\n_Hecatompedon_, set at liberty the beasts of burden that had been chiefly\r\nemployed in that work, suffering them to pasture at large, free from any\r\nfurther service. It is said that one of these afterwards came of its own\r\naccord to work, and putting itself at the head of the labouring cattle,\r\nmarched before them to the citadel. The people were pleased with this\r\nspontaneous action, and made a decree that the animal should be kept at\r\nthe public charge as long as it lived. Many have shown particular marks of\r\nregard in burying animals which they had cherished and been fond of. The\r\ngraves of Cimon\'s mares, with which he thrice conquered at the Olympic\r\ngames, are still to be seen near his own tomb. Xanthippus, whose dog swam\r\nby the side of his galley to Salamis, when the Athenians were forced to\r\nabandon their city, afterwards buried it with great pomp upon a\r\npromontory, which to this day is called the _Dog\'s Grave_. In Pliny, we\r\nhave an amusing account of a superb funeral ceremony, which took place\r\nduring the reign of Claudius; in which the illustrious departed was no\r\nother than a crow, so celebrated for its talents and address, that it was\r\nlooked upon as a sort of public property. Its death was felt as a national\r\nloss; the man who killed it was condemned to expiate the crime with his\r\nown life; and nothing less than a public funeral could, as it was thought,\r\ndo justice to its memory. The remains of the bird were laid on a bier,\r\nwhich was borne by two slaves; musicians went before it, playing mournful\r\nairs; and an infinite number of persons, of all ages and conditions,\r\nbrought up the rear of the melancholy procession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTE C.\r\n\r\nA Child Saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nA shepherd, in one of his excursions to look after his flock, took with\r\nhim one of his children, an infant of three years old. After traversing\r\nhis pastures for some time, attended by his dog, he found it necessary to\r\nascend a summit at some distance, to obtain a more extensive view of his\r\nrange. As the ascent was too fatiguing for the child, he left him on a\r\nsmall plain at the bottom, with strict injunctions not to stir from it\r\ntill his return. Scarcely, however, had he gained the summit, when the\r\nhorizon was darkened by an impenetrable mist. The anxious father instantly\r\nhastened back to find his child; but owing to the unusual darkness, he\r\nmissed his way. After a fruitless search of many hours, he discovered that\r\nhe had reached the bottom of the valley, and was near his own cottage. To\r\nrenew the search that night was equally fruitless and dangerous; he was\r\ntherefore compelled to go home, although he had lost both his child and\r\nhis dog, who had attended him faithfully for many years. Next morning, by\r\nbreak of day, the shepherd, accompanied by a band of his neighbours, set\r\nout in search of his child; but after a day of fatigue, he was obliged to\r\nreturn home disappointed. He found that the dog which he had lost the day\r\nbefore had been to the cottage, and on receiving a piece of cake, had\r\ninstantly gone off again. For several successive days the shepherd renewed\r\nthe search, and on his return in the evening he found that the dog had\r\nbeen home, and, on receiving his usual allowance of cake, had instantly\r\ndisappeared. Struck with this singular circumstance, he remained at home\r\none day; and when the dog, as usual, departed with his piece of cake, he\r\nresolved to follow him, and find out the cause of this strange procedure.\r\nThe dog led the way to a cataract at some distance from the spot where the\r\nshepherd had left his child. Down a rugged and almost perpendicular\r\ndescent the dog began, without hesitation, to make his way, and at last\r\ndisappeared by entering into a cave, the mouth of which was almost level\r\nwith the torrent. The shepherd with difficulty followed; but, on entering\r\nthe cave, what were his emotions, when he beheld his infant eating with\r\nmuch satisfaction the cake which the dog had just brought him, while the\r\nfaithful animal stood by, eyeing his young charge with the utmost\r\ncomplacency! The child had apparently wandered to the brink of the\r\nprecipice, and then either fallen or scrambled down till he reached the\r\ncave. The dog had traced him to the spot; and afterwards prevented him\r\nfrom starving, by giving up to him his own daily allowance. He appears\r\nnever to have quitted the child by night or day, except when it was\r\nnecessary to go for food; and then he was always seen running at full\r\nspeed to and from the cottage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n     UNIFORM WITH THIS VOLUME\r\n\r\n     A Hundred Fables of \xc3\x86sop\r\n\r\n     With 101 Full-page Illustrations, Title-page, and Cover by\r\n     P.

Mr. Billinghurst lends most\r\n     comical expression to the faces of the beasts. The fox with the\r\n     grapes, the dog with the shadow, the wolf with the lamb, are their\r\n     own dumb but eloquent interpreters. We even distinguish a gleam of\r\n     profound disgust in the eye of the snake biting at the file."\r\n\r\n     #Daily News.#--"The seventeenth-century version of the fables, by Sir\r\n     Roger l\'Estrange, with its pleasant quaintness of language, lends\r\n     itself, and how delightfully, to its setting of illustration; and\r\n     it would surely be a child hard to please who would cavil at this\r\n     book."\r\n\r\n     #Daily Telegraph.#--"Mr. Percy Billinghurst\'s illustrations are most\r\n     happily conceived and executed, and Mr. Kenneth Grahame\'s preface\r\n     is amusing. But perhaps the most interesting feature of the edition\r\n     is the adoption of Sir Roger l\'Estrange\'s seventeenth-century\r\n     version. Those to whom it is new will be surprised at the charm\r\n     which his quaint and vigorous diction adds to the fables."\r\n\r\n     #Scotsman.#--"The \'Fables of \xc3\x86sop\' have seldom been printed and\r\n     adorned more handsomely.... The illustrations are full of\r\n     originality and humour."\r\n\r\n     #Spectator.#--"Mr. Billinghurst\'s full-page illustrations are well\r\n     drawn, and full of a quaint humour very appropriate to the subject.\r\n     His beasts and birds are in truth animals; but he has succeeded in\r\n     giving them strongly marked characteristic expressions.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
