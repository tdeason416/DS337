GEORGE\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITTLE JOURNEY TO PUERTO RICO\r\n\r\nDo you know what people mean when they speak of "Our New Possessions"?\r\nWhat are they? Where are they? Why are men, in the streets, in the\r\nshops, everywhere, talking about them? Why are the newspapers full of\r\narticles in regard to them? Why are our lawmakers at the capital\r\ndevoting so much time and attention to them? Can you tell?\r\n\r\nSome of these things you can easily ascertain for yourselves. Others we\r\nwill speak of here.\r\n\r\nThe new territory which has lately come into the possession of the\r\nUnited States, consists of the islands of Puerto Rico, Hawaii and the\r\nPhilippines. Cuba is not included in this list; it is soon to be an\r\nindependent country.\r\n\r\nSince Puerto Rico and these other islands have come to be parts of the\r\nUnited States, everyone is anxious to learn something more of them.\r\n\r\nThe best way to learn the geography of a country and the customs of the\r\npeople is to visit the country and see with your own eyes.\r\n\r\nThat would be a difficult thing for most of us. The next best way is to\r\nmake the journey in imagination, and that all of us can do.\r\n\r\nThe island nearest us is Puerto Rico, the most eastern island of the\r\nGreater Antilles. Let us visit that first and the other islands later\r\non.\r\n\r\nWe must find out something of the climate, however, before we start on\r\nthis journey. This may not be the right season of the year to go. We\r\nmust know, too, what kind of clothing to take with us.\r\n\r\nIn order to plan our route wisely, we must know something of the\r\ngeography of the island. We should also know the past history of Puerto\r\nRico, in order to understand the customs of the people and the\r\nconditions that exist there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION, SIZE, SURFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you will find a map of the West Indies in your atlas or geography,\r\nyou will also find Puerto Rico. It is one of the four Greater Antilles\r\nIslands, and lies east of Haiti and farthest out in the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nIt is over four hundred miles from the east coast of Cuba, one thousand\r\nmiles from Havana, and about one thousand four hundred and fifty miles\r\nfrom New York.\r\n\r\nIn size it is the smallest of the group. Its area is about three\r\nthousand five hundred and fifty square miles. Its average length is\r\nabout ninety-five miles; its average breadth about thirty-five miles.\r\n\r\nIn shape it resembles the State of Connecticut, though it is only\r\nthree-fourths the size of that State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ISLAND OF PUERTO RICO.]\r\n\r\nPuerto Rico, in English, means Rich Harbor. But Puerto Rico is not rich\r\nin harbors. There are not more than six good harbors, but it has less\r\nthan three hundred and fifty miles of coast line.\r\n\r\nThe surface of Puerto Rico is mountainous. A range of hills traverses\r\nthe island from east to west. The hills are low and their sides are\r\ncovered with vegetation. The hills are not rocky and barren, but are\r\ncultivated to their very tops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN AFTERNOON SIESTA.]\r\n\r\nThe lower valleys are rich pasture lands or cultivated plantations. The\r\nknolls have orchards of cocoanuts and other trees. Coffee, protected by\r\nthe shade of other trees, grows to the summits of the green hills. The\r\nground is covered everywhere with a thick carpeting of grass.\r\n\r\nThe soil is remarkably fertile. This is due partly to the fine climate,\r\npartly to abundant moisture. The island has many fast flowing rivers.\r\nThere are over twelve hundred of these. In the mountains are numerous\r\nsprings and water falls, but these are hidden by the overhanging giant\r\nferns and plants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIEF HISTORY OF PUERTO RICO.\r\n\r\n\r\nPuerto Rico was discovered by Christopher Columbus November 17, 1493. He\r\nmade a landing at a bay, where he found springs of pure water, which was\r\nmuch needed on his ships. This place he named Aguadilla, which means\r\n"the watering place."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PONCE DE LEON.]\r\n\r\nIn 1508 Ponce de Leon, a Spanish navigator, visited the island, and was\r\nmuch pleased with its beautiful scenery and with the hospitality of the\r\nnatives. A year or two later he returned, and founded the town of\r\nCaparra. In 1509 he founded the city of San Juan on the island that\r\nguards the entrance on the east.\r\n\r\nWhen Ponce de Leon came to the island, he found it inhabited by a happy,\r\nharmless people who received him with delight. They brought gifts to\r\nhim, and showed him and his soldiers gold, which was found in the river\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\nThe kindness of the natives was rewarded by cruelty on the part of the\r\nSpaniards. They were ruthlessly murdered or reduced to slavery, and\r\ncompelled to work in the mines. A revolution followed in which the\r\ngreater number of the natives were killed.\r\n\r\nThe severe work required of those remaining so shortened their lives\r\nthat very soon all had disappeared. Not a descendant of this race is now\r\nliving, but many curious and interesting relics, left by them, may be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nOne of these is a stone collar, shaped like a horse collar, and\r\nskillfully carved. This was placed upon the breast of the native after\r\nhis death, and was supposed to keep him from harm.\r\n\r\nPonce de Leon built for himself a castle on the point of land above the\r\nmouth of the harbor of San Juan, and here he lived until he sailed on\r\nthe voyage which resulted in the discovery of Florida.\r\n\r\nAfter his departure, Puerto Rico was left alone for a long time. After\r\nsome years, Spain sent peasants to colonize the island, and slaves were\r\nintroduced to cultivate the plantations.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the island was made a province of Spain, instead of a colony. In\r\n1873 slavery was abolished.\r\n\r\nPuerto Rico came into the possession of the United States as the result\r\nof the recent war with Spain. It was ceded to the United States Sept. 6,\r\n1898.\r\n\r\nGen. George R. Davis is now Military Governor of the island. The form of\r\ngovernment for Puerto Rico has not yet been decided upon. It is one of\r\nthe problems that Congress is now working out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE--PERPETUAL JUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPuerto Rico is a very beautiful island. Its climate and scenery attract\r\nmany visitors, and erelong it will be a popular winter resort for\r\npeople from many countries.\r\n\r\nIt has been called the land of perpetual June. Flowers bloom and plants\r\nand trees yield fruit the year round. There is no winter; but during\r\nthe season which is our winter, their skies are beautifully clear and\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nThe air is neither dry nor moist, but perfect. The nights are always\r\ncool, and the trade winds keep the hottest days from being unpleasant.\r\nThe average temperature is only 80\xc2\xb0. It is the coolest and the\r\nhealthiest place in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATHERING COFFEE IN PUERTO RICO.]\r\n\r\nThere are two seasons, the rainy and the dry. The rainy season lasts\r\nfrom July to December; the dry, from January to June. From November to\r\nJune the climate is more than usually delightful and healthful. In the\r\nsummer months it is somewhat warm, and the heat and dampness are\r\noppressive in August and September.\r\n\r\nIn September and October the rain comes in torrents, but it rains in the\r\nmountains almost every day in the year. The daily showers of the rainy\r\nseason usually come late in the afternoon, but the sky clears up with\r\nthe setting sun.\r\n\r\nThe people pay little attention to drainage or to securing a supply of\r\ngood water. As a result, fevers are common during the summer months\r\namong the people who live in crowded quarters in the city or in the\r\nmarshes.\r\n\r\nHurricanes occasionally occur between the months of July and October.\r\nThese are sometimes accompanied by earthquake shocks. People may be\r\ninjured or killed and their homes destroyed during these violent storms.\r\nPuerto Rico, however, is freer from them than other islands of the West\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nA HURRICANE.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to tell when a hurricane is approaching. The wind dies away\r\nand a deathly stillness falls over everything. Not a breath of air\r\nmoves. The leaves droop on the trees and the heat almost smothers one.\r\n\r\nThe sky becomes copper-colored, and tints everything with a ghastly hue.\r\nThe cattle and other animals seem to know that danger is near, and rush\r\nabout in a terrified way.\r\n\r\nFar out in the ocean the water is calm and smooth; but near the shore\r\nthe waves rush furiously upon the beach with a mighty roar.\r\n\r\nBy and by the wind begins to rise, just a little; first from one\r\ndirection, and then from another. This is a sign that the storm is near\r\nat hand. Very soon a fearful roar is heard, and all at once the\r\nhurricane descends upon the island.\r\n\r\nThe work of destruction begins. Trees are uprooted, growing crops are\r\nlaid waste, and houses are torn down and scattered in every direction.\r\nSometimes whole villages are destroyed and many people killed or\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nWhen the barometer tells of the approach of a storm, the people prepare\r\nfor it. They hunt some hole, cave, or cellar into which to crawl. They\r\ntake with them, when there is time to do so, a supply of cane juice and\r\nfood, to last until the storm subsides.\r\n\r\n"The people guard as much as possible from the hurricanes by building\r\ntheir houses of stone with massive walls. They provide strong bars for\r\ndoors and windows. When the barometer gives notice of the approach of a\r\nstorm, these bars are brought out, and everything is at once made fast.\r\n\r\n"Doors and window-shutters are closed, barred, and double locked, and\r\nthe town looks as if it were deserted by all human beings. The state of\r\nsuspense, while the hurricane lasts, is dreadful, for no one knows when\r\nthe house may fall and bury all beneath its ruins.\r\n\r\n"Add to this the howling of the blasts, the crash of falling trees, the\r\npiercing cries for help from the wounded and dying, and one may faintly\r\npicture the terrible scene. To venture out is almost certain death, the\r\nair is so filled with flying missiles, such as boards, bricks, tiles,\r\nstones, and branches of trees."\r\n\r\nIt is indeed fortunate that the people of Puerto Rico are largely free\r\nfrom these desolating storms. Some idea of their power for destruction\r\nmay be gathered from the pictures in our papers of Galveston, Texas,\r\nafter the recent hurricane there.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE TRIP.\r\n\r\nThe best time for us to visit Puerto Rico, then, is after the hurricane\r\nseason, in the winter. January, February, and March are the favorite\r\nmonths of travelers.\r\n\r\nBut if we wish to celebrate the four hundred and seventh anniversary of\r\nthe discovery of the island, we must go in November. It was the 17th day\r\nof this month that Columbus first visited Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nWe will need to take our thinnest clothing for use on the island, but we\r\nshould have light wraps for the cool evenings.\r\n\r\nWe should also go well provided with umbrellas, rubber overshoes, and\r\nrain coats, if we do not wish to spend many afternoons indoors.\r\n\r\nNow the best way to reach Puerto Rico is not, as many people think, from\r\nCuba. San Juan, the capital, is nearly as far from Havana as from New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nWe will take the steamer from New York that goes directly to San Juan.\r\nIf the weather is good, we may expect to make the voyage in four days.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a busy crowd it is through which we pass to the New York wharf!\r\nDozens of large ships and hundreds of small vessels and sailboats crowd\r\nthe harbor.\r\n\r\nThere is a large steamer just going out. It is loaded with hardware,\r\nkerosene, pine lumber, and codfish, and is probably bound for South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nCrowds of people are going on deck with departing friends. Many of the\r\nfriends have brought or sent flowers and steamer-letters, to be enjoyed\r\nby the travelers, during the voyage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR OCEAN STEAMER.]\r\n\r\nNow the bell sounds a warning to our visitors to say good-by. They leave\r\nthe boat, and soon we are off. As we leave the harbor we listen to the\r\nband playing "America" and the "Star Spangled Banner," and take the last\r\nglimpse of our native land which we shall have for a month.\r\n\r\nIt is not far from the dinner hour, so we now visit the dining-room for\r\nthe purpose of securing our place at the table from the head steward.\r\n\r\nWe next secure a steamer chair, and have the deck steward place it in a\r\ncomfortable, sheltered place on deck. It is well, before long, to visit\r\nour staterooms, and put our clothes and other belongings in order for\r\nthe trip.\r\n\r\nBy the time this is done dinner is announced. Somehow we do not feel\r\nvery hungry. The vessel rolls about so that we begin to feel dizzy. We\r\nthink we would rather go to bed, and we try to do so, but find it rather\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThe stewardess comes in just then, and asks if she may help us. With her\r\nassistance we climb into our berths. Rock, rock, rock! If the boat would\r\nonly be quiet one moment! We are very seasick by this time, and feel as\r\nif we never wish to eat another meal. The motion of the boat lulls us to\r\nsleep by and by, and the next thing we know it is morning.\r\n\r\nThe air in our stateroom seems close and "stuffy," so we gladly leave it\r\nand go on deck, where we remain for the rest of the day. The steward\r\nserves our meals to us here, and we spend the time in our steamer\r\nchairs, watching the white-capped waves, the sea gulls over us, and the\r\nporpoises following the boat for food.\r\n\r\nAfter the first day out we sail into smoother seas and warmer weather.\r\nWe throw aside our wraps and put on lighter clothing. We also don broad\r\nshade-hats to protect our eyes from the glare of the light upon the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA favorable wind bears us southward to the tropical sea, which many\r\npeople consider among the most beautiful things in the world.\r\n\r\nThe water of the Bahama sea is wonderful because of its clearness and\r\nits deep purple color. A cloud shadow changes the purple into emerald.\r\n\r\nLooking down into the clear depths, we see the dolphins as distinctly\r\nas the birds overhead. Shoals of flying fish dart out of the water,\r\ntheir fins serving as sails for an instant; then they drop back again.\r\n\r\nMany other new and interesting objects and scenes add to the pleasure of\r\nour voyage from the great northern metropolis to the capital of the\r\nisland in the southern seas. These we can not tell about now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN JUAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we are learning of the plant and animal life about and beneath us,\r\nthe good ship bears us swiftly on, and all too soon we are at our\r\njourney\'s end.\r\n\r\nWe seem hardly to have left the shadow of Liberty\'s towering torch in\r\nNew York harbor, before the gray walls of Morro Castle appear above the\r\nhorizon. Far out at sea, this massive stone fort with its beacon light\r\nattracts our attention.\r\n\r\nAcross the harbor entrance the white-capped waves rush furiously over\r\neach other in a mad race toward the shore. Passing through this narrow\r\nchannel, the ship glides into the harbor under the guns of the two\r\npicturesque old forts which guard it, and we get our first glimpse of\r\nSan Juan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF LIBERTY--NEW YORK HARBOR.]\r\n\r\nOur first view of this beautiful old city fills us with anticipations\r\nof pleasure. We find that the ground upon which the city lies slopes\r\nupward from the calm, broad harbor to the forts that guard its heights.\r\n\r\nHere and there a tall palm-tree rears its graceful head above the tops\r\nof the gayly colored buildings that glisten in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nOur guide tells us that San Juan is one of the most perfectly fortified\r\ncities in the world. It is easy to believe this when, from the ocean and\r\nfrom the bay, we see the massive walls and battlements of the forts that\r\nguard the north and east.\r\n\r\nWe learn that they are cut from the solid rock which crowns the crest of\r\nthe narrow peninsula. The steep walls of the vast castle of San\r\nCristobal overshadow the whole city.\r\n\r\nThe city is built on an island, connected with the mainland by a bridge.\r\n\r\nIt is surrounded by a high, thick stone wall: that is, it was once upon\r\na time; but the city is now extended far beyond the walls. Inside is the\r\ncity proper, or old San Juan. Outside are the more modern buildings and\r\nthe suburbs.\r\n\r\nSan Juan is not only the seat of government, but it is considered the\r\nfirst city of Puerto Rico in interest and in importance. Ponce, however,\r\ndisputes this claim. It has the best harbor, and the best public\r\nbuildings, churches and schools on the island.\r\n\r\nThe palace of the governor-general and the headquarters of the American\r\nadministration we find located in San Juan.\r\n\r\nOver thirty thousand people make their homes in this city, and a goodly\r\nnumber of them we find at the shore to meet our vessel. They do not wait\r\nfor us to land. They come out to meet us.\r\n\r\nDusky natives in landing boats are soon alongside, and we learn to our\r\nsurprise that our ship does not go to the dock. We are to go ashore in\r\nthese small awning-covered boats. This is a new experience for us, but\r\nit is an old Spanish custom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDING FROM OUR STEAMER AT SAN JUAN.]\r\n\r\nThe steward of the ship tells us that we may retain our rooms and use\r\nthe ship as a hotel during the stay in port, going ashore for\r\nsight-seeing when we like.\r\n\r\nWe have heard that the hotels in San Juan are very poor; but of course\r\nwe wish to see for ourselves what they are like, and so we decide to\r\ngive them a trial.\r\n\r\nWe are in no hurry to seek the hotels, however. The streets of San Juan\r\npresent so many novel sights to our wandering eyes that we wish to look\r\nabout first.\r\n\r\nSTREET SCENES.\r\n\r\nWe have been told that we could walk all over the town in an hour, and\r\nwe resolve to try it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET IN SAN JUAN.]\r\n\r\nThe streets are narrow and dark, but well paved and clean. They ought to\r\nbe clean, for they are swept by hand every day. The sidewalks are so\r\nnarrow that only two of us can walk abreast, so we take to the road.\r\nThis is used as a highway for people as well as vehicles.\r\n\r\nNaked little children of all ages and colors play about the streets and\r\non the sidewalks. Colored men and women, smoking black cigars, saunter\r\nidly about. Street venders carrying their stores upon their heads or\r\nbacks, or in large panniers upon tiny ponies, fill the air with cries\r\nannouncing their wares.\r\n\r\nJudging from the number of the venders of drinks we see on the streets,\r\nevery one in San Juan is thirsty. We are, at any rate, and very\r\ndelicious we find their ices and sherbets, their iced orange, lemon and\r\nstrawberry waters, iced cherries, milk, coffee and chocolate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DULCE (SWEETMEAT) SELLERS IN PUERTO RICO.]\r\n\r\nFruit sellers under the arcades and in stalls tempt us with their\r\nattractive wares; but the fruits are new and strange to us, and we\r\nhesitate about buying.\r\n\r\nThe hack drivers are asleep on closed carriages at the hack stand. Long\r\nlines of clumsy carts, with high wheels, rumble over the cobblestone\r\npavements with a dreadful clatter.\r\n\r\nIn the open doorways of shops we see men and women manufacturing\r\narticles for sale. Some are making chairs, some shoes, some jewelry,\r\nsome boxes, and, in one place, we see a number of workmen making\r\ncoffins.\r\n\r\nWe are interested in observing that flags of different colors are used\r\nas signs, and that the walls are painted with brilliant pictures. In the\r\nquarter near the sea, the brandy stores, built of reeds, have round them\r\nswarms of beggars of every degree.\r\n\r\nThe laundry shop we find just outside the city, beside a large creek. A\r\nlaundry not built by hands! Here women stand knee-deep in the stream,\r\nwith the hot sun beating down upon their heads. They are doing their\r\nlaundry work. The clothes are cleaned by soaking them in water and\r\npounding them with stones. We wonder if there are any buttons left on\r\nthe clothes after this treatment, and resolve not to trust our clothes\r\nto this laundry.\r\n\r\nWe note outside the city wall a broad concrete walk; along this walk\r\nseats, trees, and rude statues; and between the walk and the wall an\r\nornamental garden.\r\n\r\nHaving now taken a general stroll, we will rest up preparatory to our\r\nvisit to the points of special interest.\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF INTEREST IN SAN JUAN.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to visit the places of unusual interest about the\r\ncapital city. The most noted buildings are the governor\'s palace, the\r\ncathedral, the city hall, the arsenal, the buildings used as quarters\r\nfor the troops, the forts, the castles of Morro and San Cristobal, the\r\nhouse which Ponce de Leon built, the palace of the bishop, the theater,\r\nthe hospital, the orphan asylum, the poorhouse, the jail, the library,\r\nand the colleges.\r\n\r\nIn the heart of the town, facing the City Hall, the guide shows us a\r\npublic plaza; and under the frowning walls of San Cristobal, on the\r\noutskirts of the city, he points out another. These plazas are flat,\r\nopen spaces, paved with cement and surrounded by rows of shade trees.\r\n\r\nIn the plaza of Columbus, on the outskirts of the city, is a handsome\r\nstatue of Columbus. Facing this plaza is the grand theater.\r\n\r\nIn the cool of the evening, the people gather in these plazas, and\r\nlisten to the music of the band.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting buildings in the, city to us is the "White\r\nHouse of Ponce de Leon." It is still standing where it looked northward\r\nover the sea so long ago.\r\n\r\nOn the side toward the bay is an old wall, and beyond this is a\r\nbeautiful garden and rows of palm trees. From the windows we get a fine\r\nview of the bay.\r\n\r\nThe people of San Juan have honored its founder with a statue, which\r\nstands in the center of one of its plazas.\r\n\r\nHis remains are preserved in a leaden box in the church of Santo\r\nDomingo.\r\n\r\nWe find the famous Morro Castle to be a small military town in itself,\r\nwith houses, chapel, barracks, dungeons, water tanks, warehouses, and\r\nalso a light tower, a signal station, and a light-saving station.\r\n\r\nThis ancient fort is the beginning of the wall which surrounds the city.\r\n\r\nTHE MARKET PLACE.\r\n\r\nLook at these people coming in from the country! Our guide says they are\r\ngoing to the market place. Let us follow them and see what a Puerto\r\nRican market place is.\r\n\r\nHere it is, situated near the ocean. The court is formed with stones,\r\nand it contains booths for fruits, vegetables, and produce of all kinds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOING TO MARKET.]\r\n\r\nDear me! what a busy, noisy place! People from every race and nation\r\nseem to be gathered here. Big people, little people, babies, roosters,\r\ndogs, donkeys, horses! What talking, shouting, laughing, crying,\r\ncrowing, barking, and braying!\r\n\r\nMen are smoking, lounging about, and bragging about their game-cocks;\r\nwomen are making small purchases and gossiping with neighbors; babies\r\nare tumbling about on the ground, devouring bits of fruit that come in\r\ntheir way: but all are good-natured.\r\n\r\nEach market man or woman has a place assigned, and within this space or\r\nin a booth are piled high heaps of fruits and vegetables. And such\r\nfruits and vegetables we never in our lives beheld or even dreamed of!\r\n\r\nHeaps and heaps of golden, luscious oranges are offered us by the\r\nthousand, or two for a penny. Bananas are sold five for a cent, or a\r\nbunch of a hundred bananas for twenty-five cents. Think of it! In New\r\nYork it would cost us three to five dollars.\r\n\r\nThere are ever and ever so many kinds of fruits of which we do not even\r\nknow the name. But we make a list of those whose names we do know, and\r\nhere they are: oranges, bananas, plantains, limes, lemons, cocoanuts,\r\nbread-fruit, bread nuts, pomegranates, dates, figs, pawpaws, the\r\ntamarind, sugar apple, grosella, mammee, guava, granadilla, naseberry,\r\nalligator pears, shaddocks, and Indian plums.\r\n\r\nCould you find so many in a New York, New Orleans, Chicago, or San\r\nFrancisco market, do you think?\r\n\r\nThen here are the vegetables. They would make even a longer list, but we\r\nnote a few of those with whose names and forms we are acquainted: yams,\r\nsweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, carrots, turnips, celery, beets, egg\r\nplant, radishes, peas, beans, tomatoes, cabbage, pumpkins, cantaloupes,\r\nwatermelons, squashes, peppers, cassava, yantias, and okra.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A POULTRY DEALER.]\r\n\r\nThe people in the market, seeing that we are Americans, try to charge\r\nus many times what each article is worth. If we travel very far, we will\r\nfind that this is a custom of the people in many countries. They think\r\nall Americans are rich.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MARKET PLACE AT PONCE, PUERTO RICO.]\r\n\r\nNow this is a great mistake, and so we decline very firmly to buy\r\nanything at all. This offends the market people. They wish us to make\r\nthem an offer.\r\n\r\nThey offer us their fruits for half the first price. Again we refuse. A\r\nfourth of the original price. We shake our heads.\r\n\r\nOur guide now offers to make our purchases for us, and does so for a\r\nvery small sum. And the market people and venders are quite satisfied.\r\nIt is all they expected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMES AND HOME LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA narrow, shaded street tempts us to leave the noisy, business part of\r\nthe town and the throng that crowds these streets and plazas, and stray\r\ninto the suburbs.\r\n\r\nNo matter which way we turn, some new picture meets our eyes.\r\n\r\nWandering along, we peep into doorways, courtyards and pleasant patios.\r\nSome of the houses have crosses upon their summits, to show the devotion\r\nof the inmates to their religion.\r\n\r\nOthers have a palm branch twined among the iron bars of their balconies,\r\nor placed aloft, to protect the house from evil. This branch was one of\r\nthose blessed at the cathedral the last Palm Sunday.\r\n\r\nA piece of white paper floating from the iron railing of a balcony tells\r\nus that the house is to let. Here buildings can be rented by the day or\r\nweek, as well as by the month or year.\r\n\r\nThe dwellings and other buildings are of gray stone or brick, stuccoed\r\nover and tinted blue, yellow, drab or any other color but pink.\r\n\r\nAbout half the houses are two stories in height, the others one story;\r\nbut all are flat-roofed and without chimneys. The main or upper story\r\nhas iron balconies which project over the narrow streets and darken\r\nthem. The houses have no windows of glass, but the window openings are\r\nprovided with heavy shutters. We enter these houses through interior\r\ncourts or patios.\r\n\r\nMany of the rich Puerto Ricans have fountains, trees, and flowers in\r\nthese open central courts; a few have roof gardens. Here the family sits\r\nin the evening to catch the cool sea breezes. Others sit on their\r\nbalconies along the outside of the house, or along the inner court or\r\npatio.\r\n\r\nThe patio is the coolest place about the house during the heated hours\r\nof the day. Here the women bring their sewing or embroidery, and chat.\r\nIt is also the favorite playground of the children, and in its shade the\r\nmen of the household take their afternoon nap.\r\n\r\nThere are no yards or gardens attached to these houses. The only green\r\nspots to be found are the inner courts, the public squares or plazas,\r\nand the garden of the Governor-General\'s palace.\r\n\r\nThere is no portion of the city set aside for the rich or the poor.\r\nPeople of means, of education, and of refinement live in the upper\r\nstories. The poor live in crowded rooms and patios, and in basements or\r\nin dirty alleys.\r\n\r\nMany of the wealthy, fashionable people live in the pretty suburban\r\ntowns. Others, who are engaged in business in the cities, live over\r\ntheir stores, on the second floor.\r\n\r\nThe lower floors are occupied by servants, or poor people. To reach the\r\nupper stories of these buildings, we must pass through a crowd of\r\nchildren, dogs, and poultry in the courtyard below.\r\n\r\nUpstairs the rooms are large and the ceilings lofty. The windows reach\r\nto the floor, and the shutters are kept open to admit the air.\r\n\r\nThe homes of even the wealthy seem to us plainly furnished. There is no\r\nupholstered furniture. It is too warm for this, they tell us. But wood\r\nfurniture, wickerwork, and willow ware are used.\r\n\r\nThe floors in the best houses are tiled or are made of hard wood.\r\n\r\nCarpets are never used, but rugs are seen occasionally in the center of\r\na room.\r\n\r\nThe bedrooms are small and not well ventilated. The beds are canopied\r\nand trimmed with fine handmade lace.\r\n\r\nThe walls are usually bare; but here and there a fine painting may be\r\nseen. Giant ferns and broad-spreading palm leaves are used to festoon\r\nthe walls and arched doorways. These are cut fresh and renewed from day\r\nto day, and they make the dark, cool rooms attractive and inviting.\r\nWithin and without the house, potted tropical plants are found.\r\n\r\nPeeping into the bath room of one of these homes we see, not a bath\r\ntub, but a swimming pool large enough to accommodate a young whale.\r\n\r\nWe think this an improvement on our bath tubs at home, and of the joy it\r\nwould give the average United States boy to add such a feature to his\r\nown home.\r\n\r\nFOOD AND DRINK.\r\n\r\nFor water the people have, until quite recently, been dependent upon\r\ncisterns, in which the rain that falls upon the flat roofs is collected.\r\nThese cisterns are in the patio, or courtyard, and an open drain runs\r\nthrough the same place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BREAD SELLER.]\r\n\r\nMuch of the cooking is done here by the poorer people.\r\n\r\nIt seems to us that cooking in houses without chimneys would be rather\r\ndifficult, but then these people do not use stoves or coal. They cook\r\nover a small pot, or brazier, or furnace of charcoal.\r\n\r\nThey cook less food, too, than people who live in the North. They live\r\nlargely on fruits and vegetables and have little meat.\r\n\r\nIce is used only by the families of the wealthy, and it is impossible to\r\nkeep milk or fresh meat for any length of time. In place of ice-water\r\nthe people store water in porous jars, and in this way it is kept cool.\r\n\r\nThey prepare many refreshing drinks to be used in place of water by\r\nusing oranges, lemons, limes, cocoanuts, and the milk of almonds.\r\n\r\nThey also indulge very often in little ices, which the venders bring to\r\nthe doors many times a day.\r\n\r\nThe poorer people, who can not afford to indulge in such expensive\r\ndrinks and ices, use barley water, or water with toasted corn and sugar\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nThe people have coffee or chocolate and biscuits for the first or early\r\nbreakfast. The second breakfast is eaten between eleven and twelve\r\no\'clock, and corresponds to our lunch. Dinner is eaten at six or seven\r\no\'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nMany of the business men take the morning meal with their clerks at a\r\nlong table on a veranda, or in a room of the establishment. From three\r\nto four o\'clock in the afternoon everyone indulges in a siesta or nap.\r\n\r\nAlong the wharves and in the outskirts of the city, the houses are but\r\none story high, and many of them are built of wood. These houses have\r\nbut one window and are dark and poorly ventilated; yet they are crowded\r\nwith poor people.\r\n\r\nSome of them have patches of garden separated by rows or hedges of\r\ncactus. Here we see brown mothers sitting in the sun mending fish nets.\r\nTheir naked little children are at play near them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Puerto Rico, on a casual glance, appear to us to come from\r\nevery nation on earth. The first person you meet will be black, the next\r\nbrown, the third yellow, and the fourth white.\r\n\r\nAfter a time we are able to divide them into five classes: the upper\r\nclass of white Puerto Ricans; the lower class of whites, or peasants;\r\nthe negroes; the mixed people of negro and Indian or other blood; and\r\nthe foreigners.\r\n\r\nAmong these last are Germans, Swedes, Danes, Russians, Frenchmen,\r\ndescendants of Moorish Jews and of natives of the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nAll of these people speak Spanish, however, and have the Spanish\r\ncustoms, manners, and religion.\r\n\r\nOf the 850,000 people, less than one half are colored or of mixed blood.\r\n\r\nThe upper class of white Puerto Ricans is descended from Spanish stock,\r\nand in this class are found the wealthy planters and stock raisers, the\r\nmerchants, and the professional men.\r\n\r\nThey are a happy, good-looking, hospitable, polite, and prosperous\r\npeople. Many of them are fairly well educated.\r\n\r\nIn appearance these people resemble the Cubans, having regular features\r\nand dark hair and eyes.\r\n\r\nThe men are not large, but are well built, erect and graceful.\r\n\r\nThe women have clear complexions, delicate features, and small hands and\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nHeavy clothing is not worn. The men dress in white (light linen or\r\ncotton), and the women in cotton or other thin material.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the family are secluded very closely. They spend much of\r\ntheir time in the patios or on the balconies of their homes,\r\nembroidering, making lace, and gossiping. They care little for reading\r\nor for study.\r\n\r\nThe Puerto Rican is generous and hospitable. He tells you, as does the\r\nCuban, that his house and all it contains, his servants, his horses, his\r\npossessions, are yours to use and to have.\r\n\r\nBut of course he does not mean that you shall accept these gifts. He\r\nmeans that he expects you to use them freely so long as you are a guest\r\nin his house.\r\n\r\nBy these well-to-do people, any sort of labor is regarded as degrading\r\nand altogether out of the question; so they keep many servants. Some are\r\npaid and some receive only their board and clothes. But all are content.\r\n\r\nThe working people are of one color, a light brown, with black eyes and\r\nstraight hair. They are rather small and thin; and many of those living\r\nin the cities are ill-fed and diseased.\r\n\r\nThey are ignorant and somewhat indolent, but are gentle, quick of wit,\r\nand teachable. Though cruel to their animals, they are kind to their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThere are many beautiful girls in the lower classes as well as in the\r\nupper, and these we see on the streets and in the market places.\r\n\r\nMany of them use long scarlet shawls and wear black satin slippers on\r\ntheir bare, pretty little feet. They are as proud of their little feet\r\nas of their hands. Some of the girls in the market have hair\r\nthree-quarters the length of their body; but while it is so black and\r\nabundant, it is extremely coarse. The laboring men cut their hair short\r\nin the neck, and wear a thick bang on the forehead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BEGGAR OF PUERTO RICO.]\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the island beggars appeal to us with outstretched hand.\r\nEven the little children are taught to add their mite to the family\r\nincome by begging.\r\n\r\nIn Ponce these beggars secure a special license to pursue this\r\nprofession and have a regular system. In certain houses, on certain\r\ndays, a little table is placed in the doorway and a row of copper cents\r\nor coins upon it.\r\n\r\nThe beggars who are privileged to come to these homes, come at the right\r\ntime, take their pennies, and with a "Thank you!" shamble off.\r\n\r\nCHILD LIFE.\r\n\r\nFormerly lessons never bothered the small Puerto Rican, or indeed any\r\nother Puerto Rican child. He played "hookey" all day long, and no truant\r\nofficer disturbed him, or dragged him off to school.\r\n\r\nHe never saw a schoolhouse or the inside of a schoolroom. He never saw a\r\nbook. But, for that matter, neither did his father or mother. They can\r\nneither read nor write; nor can many of their neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe Puerto Rican city child often lives in a crowded basement, with many\r\nbrothers and sisters. The child of poor parents in the cities is not\r\nusually very clean; but then he has very few opportunities for bathing,\r\nand his only playground is the courtyard and the streets.\r\n\r\nHis little country cousins, who live where pools and streams are found,\r\nspend much of their time in the water. They find it pleasanter to paddle\r\nin cool streams, beneath overhanging tree ferns and banana trees, than\r\nto roll in the dirt.\r\n\r\nThey object, however, to wearing clothes, and are allowed to go without\r\nany until they are ten or twelve years of age. Even at this age they\r\nshed briny tears when compelled to put on one cotton garment.\r\n\r\nThese little country children learn to be helpful at a very early age.\r\nThey fish and catch crabs; weed the garden; dig potatoes; gather fruit,\r\nvegetables and coffee; and do errands.\r\n\r\nBut they have one bugaboo, and that is the wild dog. This animal is very\r\nfierce. It sometimes leaves its hiding place in the forest, with a pack\r\nof companions, and carries off sheep, pigs, and calves.\r\n\r\nIf very hungry, it may attack a child; and so the children keep a sharp\r\nlookout for it.\r\n\r\nChildren in Puerto Rico sleep on the floor or in a hammock, and they eat\r\nwhenever or wherever they can find fruit or vegetables within their\r\nreach. Sometimes they smoke, too.\r\n\r\nThey have no toys, no books, no pictures, no fine clothes or homes; yet,\r\nfor all that, they are cheerful and contented. They have little, but\r\nthey seem to want little.\r\n\r\nThe children of the wealthy and well-to-do dress and look very much like\r\nthe children in our Southern States; though the babies and very young\r\nchildren sometimes wear no clothes.\r\n\r\nThese children are sent to school, or are taught by a governess or tutor\r\nat home, until they are old enough to be sent away to school.\r\n\r\nThen they are sent to Spain, France, or the United States, to complete\r\ntheir education.\r\n\r\nThe girls study and read very little. It is not considered necessary\r\nfor them to be well educated. They are not allowed to walk about the\r\nstreets alone, but must have a servant, nurse, or attendant from the\r\ntime they leave their cradles until they are married.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION IN PUERTO RICO.\r\n\r\nNot more than one seventh of the 850,000 people in Puerto Rico can read\r\nor write. Only one child in twelve, between the ages of six and sixteen,\r\nattends school. (In 1897, of 125,000 children of school age, only about\r\n28,000 attended school--about 19,000 boys and 9,000 girls.)\r\n\r\nThe buildings used for school purposes are seldom anything more than\r\nthatched huts. Sometimes two or three rooms are given to the school in\r\nthe house where the teacher lives.\r\n\r\nMany of the country districts are without schools, and no school\r\nprivileges are provided for three fourths of the people.\r\n\r\nThe schools are of the old-fashioned, ungraded, district-school type,\r\nand are for pupils from seven to thirteen years of age.\r\n\r\nPupils are supposed to study arithmetic, geography, grammar, the history\r\nof Spain, and religion. There are few schoolbooks used. The pupils write\r\ndown what the teacher dictates, or copy what the teacher has written.\r\nThe one book they use is the one from which they learn to read.\r\n\r\nArithmetic problems are often worked out on the floor with bits of clay.\r\n\r\nThere are from fifty to one hundred and twenty-five pupils in each room,\r\nand two or three teachers. The pupils sit on long benches or on the\r\nfloor. The boys and girls have separate schools; but the white and the\r\ncolored pupils attend the same school.\r\n\r\nThe pupils are bright and quick to learn, but there is no discipline in\r\nthe schoolroom. They come and go as they please. They stay at home if\r\nthey wish, and no truant officer disturbs them.\r\n\r\nMany remain away from school because of a lack of clothing. Others\r\nremain away because they prefer to play in the streets. Their parents\r\nare careless and indifferent to the advantages of an education, and make\r\nno effort to induce their children to attend school, or to study.\r\n\r\nThis unfavorable state of things is soon to disappear. The United States\r\nis now rapidly introducing schools and capable teachers into every part\r\nof the island. The people seem very glad to take advantage of the better\r\norder of things.\r\n\r\nRELIGION.\r\n\r\nThe established church of the country is the Roman Catholic; but other\r\nreligions are tolerated, and a few Protestant churches are to be found\r\nscattered over the island.\r\n\r\nThe people seem to be little interested in religion or in their\r\nchurches, and Sunday with them is only a f\xc3\xaate day or a holiday.\r\n\r\nHOW THE PEOPLE AMUSE THEMSELVES.\r\n\r\nThe people of Puerto Rico have two hundred holidays or feast days in\r\ntheir calendar. They are always ready to welcome new ones, however, and\r\nhave within the past year added Washington\'s birthday and the Fourth of\r\nJuly to the list.\r\n\r\nLast year they celebrated the Fourth for the first time. In all the\r\ncities there were speeches in the daytime and fireworks at night. In the\r\ncountry there were races and processions in honor of the new "feast\r\nday," or holiday.\r\n\r\nThe people show their patriotism and loyalty to the flag of the United\r\nStates in many ways. They are eager and quick to adopt American manners\r\nand customs.\r\n\r\nJust before sunset, the band comes into the Plaza at Ponce and plays the\r\n"Star Spangled Banner" in front of headquarters as the American flag is\r\ndrawn down for the night.\r\n\r\nThe Puerto Ricans noticed that the American men took off their hats and\r\nstood with uncovered heads while the flag made its descent; and now\r\nthey, too, show their loyalty by doffing their hats when the flag comes\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe people of Puerto Rico are extremely fond of music. Strolling bands\r\nof guitar and mandolin players are numerous; and at evening time the air\r\nis filled with music.\r\n\r\nEach peasant makes his own guitar. It is a very curious instrument. This\r\nguitar music is usually accompanied by music from another instrument\r\ncalled a guida. This is made from the great curve-necked gourd. The\r\nmusic or sound is made by passing a piece of umbrella wire up and down a\r\nseries of notches cut from end to end on the outside curve of the gourd.\r\n\r\nThe sound produced is much like that made by rubbing together two pieces\r\nof sandpaper. We would not call it music at all, but the natives seem to\r\nlike it. No orchestra is complete without it, and one can hear the\r\nscratching of this instrument almost any time, at any home in Puerto\r\nRico.\r\n\r\nSunday is a day not of rest, but of merry making. During the early\r\nmorning hours the Puerto Ricans go to church. After church, they hurry\r\naway to the cockpit or to the bull ring in the suburbs of the town.\r\n\r\nVery early in the morning we see numbers of roosters staked out by short\r\nstrings to pegs driven in the sidewalks. These are the game-cocks which\r\nfurnish to the Puerto Rican his favorite amusement and opportunity for\r\ngambling.\r\n\r\nThey seem to realize their importance and keep up a great crowing,\r\nsending challenges of defiance back and forth to each other. Their\r\nowners take good care of them and endeavor to keep them in good\r\ncondition for fighting.\r\n\r\nIn the market places we see these fowls in wicker coops. Many venders of\r\nfood and other articles have game-cocks tied by strings to their stools\r\nand stations.\r\n\r\nWhen their owners have nothing else to do, they devote themselves to\r\ntraining these birds; or they try to find some one willing to match them\r\nin a contest.\r\n\r\nThe buildings where these fights take place are to be found in every\r\ntown and village. They are considered next in importance to the\r\ncathedral and the town hall, and more important than the schools.\r\n\r\nThe cock fights are usually held on Sundays and holidays, and last the\r\ngreater part of the day. On the day set for these fights, the birds are\r\ntaken to the arena, descriptions given and amounts wagered. One fight\r\nfollows another, and large sums of money are lost and won.\r\n\r\nBURDEN BEARING.\r\n\r\nIf a country is without good roads, it must employ human\r\nburden-carriers; and many of these we see in Puerto Rico. Men and women\r\nwalk long distances through the country bearing heavy burdens upon their\r\nheads, shoulders or backs.\r\n\r\nThe banana and plantain men carry their fruit fastened to poles. They\r\nmove along quite easily with two hundred pounds or more of fruit. On the\r\nstreet and in the market place we hear the singsong notes of the\r\nvegetable man telling us of the excellence of his wares. These he\r\ncarries on his head on an immense board, sometimes five feet long.\r\n\r\nThe dulce seller, too, carries his tray of cocoanut dulces, guava jelly\r\nand other sweets on his woolly pate; as do also the sellers of fruits,\r\nbread, cakes, bottled cocoanut milk and trinkets.\r\n\r\nThe hat weaver and the broom maker carry their wares on a shoulder pole,\r\nwith a load fastened to each end so as to balance it.\r\n\r\nThe milkman carries an open-mouthed ten-gallon milk can on his head.\r\nFrom this dangle the ladles and measures he uses.\r\n\r\nBut he does not always deliver milk in this way. Sometimes he rides up\r\nin front of the door astride his horse, and shouts "milk" at the top of\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\nOn each side of his horse are fastened milk cans, and from these cans he\r\nladles without dismounting.\r\n\r\nSometimes he drives his cows before him and milks them at his customer\'s\r\ndoor. This is the favorite method, because the milk is then sure to be\r\nsweet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PUERTO RICAN HAT WEAVER.]\r\n\r\nThis is not always the case if the milk is carried some distance in the\r\nhot sun, in uncovered tin cans.\r\n\r\nThe milkman always comes very early in the morning, and so does the\r\nbaker. If the baker is not on time, we must wait for our breakfast; for\r\nbread is not baked in the house. It is always bought.\r\n\r\nWe can hear him long before he reaches our door, for he keeps up a\r\nplaintive cry in order to attract our attention.\r\n\r\nSometimes our human bread wagon carries a great board or basket on his\r\nhead, and in this are as many as fifty loaves. (See illustration, page\r\n26).\r\n\r\nThe butcher, on horseback, brings meat hanging from hooks in frames.\r\nMuch of the poultry is brought to town in great odd wicker coops strung\r\nacross the backs of ponies. Here is a poultry vender at the street\r\ncorner, with his inverted and excited merchandise suspended by strings\r\nfrom his shoulder. (See page 22).\r\n\r\nHOW THE PEOPLE TRAVEL.\r\n\r\nPuerto Rico is a very delightful place to visit, but we do not care to\r\ngo there to live until there are better roads.\r\n\r\nThere is but one good road on the island, the one leading from San Juan\r\nto Ponce. There is only one line of street cars (in the city of\r\nMayaguez); and there are only one hundred and forty-seven miles of\r\nrailroad in the whole island.\r\n\r\nThe best roads run along the coast from town to town. There is one\r\nexception. This is the wonderful military road which connects Ponce, on\r\nthe south shore, with San Juan on the north shore. (See map, page 4).\r\n\r\nParts of the country away from the coasts are reached by bridle paths;\r\nbut the roads outside the cities and towns are impassable during the\r\nrainy season. Sometimes there is only a bridle path or trail overgrown\r\nwith tangled vegetation, and crossed by streams without bridges.\r\n\r\nThe means of transportation employed by the people are the pony carriage\r\nor surrey, the saddle horse, the ox-cart and the foot. The beast of\r\nburden is either the donkey or the pony. These animals are employed to\r\ncarry goods in packs over the trails, in place of using the wagon.\r\n\r\nThe ponies are usually small, half-starved, badly treated animals. They\r\ncarry great burdens, that look heavy enough to crush them to the ground.\r\n\r\nTheir food consists of green corn and grass. One of the commonest sights\r\non the road, street, or marketplace is the pony with his load of green\r\nfodder.\r\n\r\nThis is usually so large that it covers the animal entirely, but the\r\nmaster is always in plain view, sitting astride the moving corn-stack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PUERTO RICAN PONY LOADED.]\r\n\r\nThe planters and farmers have an odd-looking saddle, which they use on\r\nthese ponies. It is a leather pad to which are attached wicker baskets.\r\n\r\nThe well-to-do farmers who own ponies carry fruit and vegetables in\r\nthese baskets. Sometimes two hogs are brought to market in the baskets,\r\nwith all four feet tied together.\r\n\r\nWhen the farmer takes his family to market, he and his wife ride the\r\npony, and the children ride in the baskets.\r\n\r\nThe ponies also carry bales of grass, trunks, and all kinds of household\r\ngoods, and furniture.\r\n\r\nThe principal draught animals are oxen. The heavy two-wheeled ox cart\r\nis used to convey great loads of sugar, coffee, and tobacco or fruit,\r\nover the good roads.\r\n\r\nGreat, strong, patient beasts they are. They are yoked by a bar of heavy\r\nwood fastened to their horns.\r\n\r\nThey are driven, not with words or whip, but with a goad. The driver or\r\nteamster walks in front of his team and waves his arms and goad the way\r\nhe wishes them to go.\r\n\r\nIf they do not follow fast enough to please him, he urges them along by\r\nprodding them. The end of the goad is shod with a sharp spike of steel,\r\nthree inches or more long. Often we see these oxen dripping with blood,\r\nand seamed and scarred with wounds.\r\n\r\nBesides the pain of this constant goading, they suffer from flies upon\r\ntheir face, nose and eyes. Since their heads are bound, they can not\r\nshake the flies off.\r\n\r\nAll day they stand or travel in the hot sun without water or food.\r\n\r\nEven when they stop or rest, no one thinks of putting them in the shade.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the people are cruel to their animals, yet they seem not to\r\nrealize that they are doing wrong. It is a custom, that is all.\r\n\r\nIt makes us wish we might organize a society for the prevention of\r\ncruelty. It is, perhaps, the only thing that could change this custom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FARMER AND HIS HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nPuerto Rico is a country of farmers. Nearly five-sixths of the people\r\nlive in the country. Their homes are scattered along the valleys, on the\r\nhills, and even on the mountain tops; for the land is fertile\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PUERTO RICAN FARMER IN TOWN.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen the homes and home life of the people in the city. Now let\r\nus take a jaunt out into the country to see how the farmers and the\r\nplantation laborers live.\r\n\r\nHere is a farmer now, coming down the street. He is on his way to the\r\nmarket. His horse is a thin, mean-looking little beast. His produce is\r\ncarried in baskets, and his machete is sticking out of one of these.\r\n\r\nThis machete he always carries with him. He could not get along without\r\nit. It is a large, long, clumsy knife, something like a corn-cutter.\r\nSometimes he uses it to cut a way for himself and pony through the\r\nforest, or on the bridle paths overgrown with plants and vines after the\r\nrainy season.\r\n\r\nWhen he has sold his load of vegetables and fruit, we will ride out with\r\nhim to his home and visit some of the plantations.\r\n\r\nWe saw many peasant farmers and laborers in the market place, and found\r\nthem polite, shrewd, bright in conversation, but very ignorant and\r\nsomewhat indolent.\r\n\r\nThey are quite content with their way of living, and take no thought for\r\nthe future. A Puerto Rican farmer thinks himself rich and fortunate if\r\nhe owns a horse, a cow, some game-cocks, a gun and an acre of land.\r\n\r\nHe is simple in his tastes and buys little in the market. His rice\r\nflour, corn meal and coffee he has prepared at home, by pounding in\r\nwooden mortars or grinding between stones.\r\n\r\nHis patch of land he plants with corn, sweet potatoes and other\r\nvegetables. Bananas, plantains and other fruits grow wild and may be had\r\nfor the picking.\r\n\r\nHis vegetables, fruit and poultry he takes to the market and sells, but\r\nonly when compelled to do so by necessity.\r\n\r\nThis money is spent for clothing or other articles, or perhaps lost in\r\ngambling.\r\n\r\nOnly the lightest kind of clothing is necessary; for the coldest days\r\nare not so cold as our mild autumn days.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the farmer consists of a cotton jacket, white shirt and\r\ncheck pantaloons. His head is protected from the hot rays of the sun by\r\na large broad-brimmed hat. This is made from the grass which grows\r\naround his doorway. No shoes are needed.\r\n\r\nThe dress of his wife is a simple white cotton gown, and his children\r\nwear no clothes at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME OF A PEASANT FARMER OF THE BETTER CLASS.]\r\n\r\nThe houses or homes of the peasant farmers are nearly all alike. They\r\nare built in a few days, from poles and royal palm bark. They are\r\nthatched with leaves of the palm or with grass. These huts are usually\r\ndivided into two rooms.\r\n\r\nThere are no chimneys, often no windows, and but one door. A very poor\r\nhouse, you think; but then it is only intended for a shelter. It shields\r\nthem from the damp and cool winds of night and the daily rains of the\r\nrainy season. At other times they live outside.\r\n\r\nThere is no stove, and of cooking utensils there are few. The cooking is\r\ndone for the most part outside the house, when the weather is dry, on a\r\nsheet of iron or in an iron kettle. The food is served in gourd dishes\r\nand eaten with gourd spoons.\r\n\r\nDuring the rainy season the people live in great discomfort. The\r\ncooking must be done inside the hut at this time. As there is no\r\nchimney, the room is soon filled with smoke, which can only escape\r\nthrough the openings under the eaves.\r\n\r\nWould you like to see the furniture of one of these poor cabins? It\r\nconsists of a few calabash shells used for eating vessels; some rude\r\nearthen pots; a tin cup, perhaps; two or three hammocks made of the bark\r\nof the palm tree, and a machete.\r\n\r\nBunches of dried herbs and gourds dangle on the walls, but there are no\r\npictures, curtains, or ornaments of any kind.\r\n\r\nAt night the people sleep on the floor, or in hammocks. They spend much\r\nof the day also in swinging to and fro in their hammocks, smoking, and\r\nplaying on their guitars and other native musical instruments.\r\n\r\nBy the door the family dog and the naked babies tumble in the dirt.\r\nPerhaps there is a pig and some poultry; but there is sure to be a\r\ngame-cock or two.\r\n\r\nNear the house is the garden. In this are raised sweet potatoes, beans,\r\nsquashes, muskmelons, peppers, gourds, calabashes, bananas and\r\nplantains.\r\n\r\nThe farmers we see at work have their oxen harnessed to rude plows by\r\nthe horns. The ground is so rich it is not necessary to plow it very\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nAn acre of good land here will produce more vegetables and fruit than in\r\nmost other countries.\r\n\r\nRiding through the country we see plantations of coffee, sugar cane or\r\ntobacco, and also stock farms. Puerto Rico is fertile from the mountain\r\ntops to the sea. It is rich in pasture lands, shaded with groves of palm\r\ntrees, and watered by hundreds of streams.\r\n\r\nHere and there herds of horses and cattle and flocks of sheep graze on\r\nthe plains. When we approach the flocks of sheep, we discover a very\r\ncurious thing. The wool on these sheep is not at all like the wool on\r\nthe sheep raised in our own country. It is more like the hair of the\r\ngoat.\r\n\r\nCattle are highly valued by the people, not only for dairy and food\r\npurposes, but as beasts of burden and draft.\r\n\r\nOutside of the large plantations, crops are raised on a small scale; and\r\nmodern implements and machinery are almost unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MOUNTAIN VILLAGE IN PUERTO RICO.]\r\n\r\nMost of the land is divided up into very small farms or garden patches,\r\nor is taken up by groves.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the country are many little villages, shut out from\r\nthe rest of the world. We reach them by the narrow horse-trails that\r\nwind in and out among the mountains.\r\n\r\nTHE LABORER\'S HILLSIDE HOME.\r\n\r\nPerched on the hilltops and sides, shaded by banana trees, are the\r\npicturesque little huts of the laborers. Most of them pay no rent. Land\r\nowners give them small patches of ground on the hillsides, which they\r\nthemselves do not care to till, in order to have the laborers near or on\r\nthe plantations to assist in cultivating or harvesting the sugar cane,\r\ntobacco and coffee crops.\r\n\r\nHere the peasant laborers build their cabins; and, when there is no work\r\nfor them on the plantations, they tend their gardens in a haphazard way.\r\nBy working a little each day they manage to make a scant living.\r\n\r\nFive months of the year they labor for their landlords, receiving about\r\nfifty cents a day.\r\n\r\nThe laborer is often paid in plantains. Fifty plantains are a day\'s pay.\r\nOn this he feeds his family, for the plantain is the Puerto Rican\r\npeasant\'s bread.\r\n\r\nThe plantains left are taken to market and sold. One day a week is lost\r\nin this way, for the market is often twenty miles away.\r\n\r\nNear a stream on the mountain side we see a group of women. Some of them\r\nare sitting on stones by the bank; others are standing in the hot sun in\r\nmidstream, and all are washing.\r\n\r\nIt is wash day, and they have brought their clothes here to wash them.\r\nThey have no tubs, wash-boards, clothes-pins, or clothes-lines.\r\nSometimes they have no soap. In place of this, they use the seed or\r\nroots of the soapberry tree.\r\n\r\nThe soap-seed tree bears several months in the year. The seed is\r\ninclosed in a yellow skin, and is black, and about the size of a marble.\r\nThe leaf of a vine, called the soap vine is also used for the purpose of\r\nwashing clothes.\r\n\r\nThe clothes are first soaked in the stream or pond, and then spread\r\nupon a broad, smooth stone; after which they are pounded with clubs or\r\nstones. When they are clean, they are spread out upon the bushes to dry\r\nand bleach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COOKING THE EVENING MEAL.]\r\n\r\nThen the tired women rest under the trees, and chat, and perhaps smoke\r\nuntil evening. When the hot sun has gone down in the west, they make\r\ntheir damp and dry clothes up into huge bundles, lift them to their\r\nheads, and plod homeward.\r\n\r\nLet us follow them to their homes up on the mountain side. Some of the\r\nhuts are built closely together. Others are scattered about on lonely\r\nledges. Shall we go inside one of these huts? The woman who has just\r\nreturned has thrown her burden into a corner.\r\n\r\nThe fire has been carefully smoldered, and this she now blows into a\r\nflame and then proceeds to prepare the evening meal.\r\n\r\nAbout the other cottages are women squatting on their heels, gossiping\r\nwith one another. In the ditch near by little children paddle about.\r\nTheir voices are soft and pleasant, and their play merry and\r\ngood-natured. We hear no quarreling.\r\n\r\nNow their mother calls them to bring in some sticks for the fire. When\r\nthese are added to the flame, the firelight shines out in the darkness\r\nand guides the father on his homeward way.\r\n\r\nHe has been working on the coffee plantation near, and is now climbing\r\nthe narrow, winding path up the hill with his load of plantains. Perhaps\r\nthe wife will cook some for supper.\r\n\r\nThe children satisfy their hunger, and then creep into their corner or\r\nhammock and are soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\nOut in the darkness we hear the tinkle of a homemade guitar. Now\r\nanother, and then another, takes up the Spanish or Indian air. Perhaps\r\nthe beater of a drum is added to the little band of musicians which has\r\ngathered in an open space near the small village.\r\n\r\nThe natives compose much of their own music, and wild, strange melody it\r\nis. It seems to inspire one with a wish to dance. The Puerto Ricans are\r\nvery fond of this amusement, and when they hear the music of the band,\r\nthey gather around for a frolic.\r\n\r\nOnce a week, at least, they gather for a dance; and this, with their\r\ncock-fighting and gambling, is almost their only form of amusement.\r\n\r\nFew of these people can write or read. They have no books and can not\r\nafford to buy even a newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe life of the peasant in Puerto Rico, you see, is not an easy or\r\npleasant one; but he does not suffer from cold or hunger, as do the poor\r\nin northern countries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nGLIMPSES OF OTHER CITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now a very good idea of San Juan and of rural life in districts\r\nnear it.\r\n\r\nSo let us travel about the island a bit, for glimpses of other parts of\r\nthe country, and of the other important cities.\r\n\r\nThe most comfortable way to do this would be to make the voyage around\r\nthe island on board the ship, going ashore for sight-seeing when the\r\nship makes port for freight.\r\n\r\nBut this would give us no opportunity to see the interior of the island;\r\nso we make up our minds to endure poor roads in order to enjoy the mild\r\nadventures that fall to our lot (as all good travelers should do).\r\n\r\nWe decide to celebrate the seventeenth of November, the anniversary of\r\nthe discovery of the island, at the place where the ship of Columbus\r\nfirst touched land over four hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nWe find no Pullman cars on the railroad which leaves San Juan for\r\nAguadilla; but the novelty of the ride takes the place of the luxuries\r\nto which we are accustomed at home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENDING SUGAR ABROAD.]\r\n\r\nThe train goes leisurely along at the rate of sixteen miles an hour. We\r\nare glad that it goes no faster, for it gives us an opportunity to see\r\nthe beautiful country through which we are passing.\r\n\r\nThe line follows the coast most of the way. Upon one side are frequent\r\nviews of the ocean, and upon the other a constant panorama of wonderful\r\nscenery.\r\n\r\nARECIBO.\r\n\r\nA ride of four or five hours brings us to Arecibo, a town of 7,000\r\npeople, on the north coast. It is the headquarters of the sugar\r\nindustry, and the chief town of one of the most fruitful regions on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThe harbor is very poor, being little more than an open roadstead. Into\r\nthis harbor empties a small stream called the Arecibo. Goods are\r\ntransported on this river, to and from the town, in flat-bottomed boats,\r\nwith the aid of long poles and by much patient pushing.\r\n\r\nAlong the river are valuable plantations of sugar and coffee, as also\r\nfine pastures.\r\n\r\nArecibo boasts one of the most handsome and artistic plazas on the\r\nisland. These plazas are usually paved with stone and devoid of\r\nvegetation; but this one has a small park in its center, surrounding a\r\nbeautiful fountain.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral, which faces the plaza, is larger than usual, and more\r\nmodern than most of the church buildings in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHEDRAL AT ARECIBO.]\r\n\r\nAGUADILLA.\r\n\r\nAfter a night spent in Arecibo we wish to hasten on to Aguadilla, but\r\nthe railroad, we find, will not carry us so far. It ends at Camuy, a few\r\nmiles west of Arecibo. Here we take a carriage for the remainder of the\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING AND HULLING COFFEE.]\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned coaches are drawn by small ponies, and these brave\r\nlittle animals carry us up hill and down hill, through deep mud holes,\r\nover rocks, into and out of ruts, at a terrific pace.\r\n\r\nWe wonder that the carriage does not break and spill us out. The driver\r\nlashes the poor beasts until it seems as if his arms must be lame, but\r\nour protests have no effect on him.\r\n\r\nAguadilla, a quiet, peaceful little city of 5,000, lies on the western\r\ncoast. Here Columbus landed in search of water when he made his second\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nHe found a clear, rippling spring, with the water filled his casks, and\r\ncontinued on his way. On the shore stands a cross marking the spot where\r\nhis boat\'s keel touched the sand.\r\n\r\nThe town has beautiful trees, and is surrounded by choice grazing-lands.\r\nIt is noted for its fish, sugar-cane, sweet oranges, and lemons.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of sugar-cane, coffee, tobacco and cocoanuts furnishes\r\nthe industries of the neighborhood. We find the three establishments for\r\nthe preparation of coffee for market very interesting places to visit.\r\n\r\nMAYAGUEZ.\r\n\r\nLeaving Aguadilla for Mayaguez, we take the tramway which connects the\r\ntwo towns. It is the only one on the island, and the people are very\r\nproud of it. But oh, what a ridiculous little road!\r\n\r\nIt is a narrow gauge, not more than forty-seven inches wide. The cars\r\nare quite diminutive, and do not carry more than ten or twelve people.\r\nWe can ride the length of the road, about two miles, for five cents.\r\n\r\nWe see long lines of patient oxen plodding their way to the city,\r\npulling clumsy carts piled high with oranges. Mayaguez is the market to\r\nwhich the best oranges in Puerto Rico come.\r\n\r\nLarge, sweet, and luscious we find this fruit, the principal food of\r\nmany of the people.\r\n\r\nIt grows wild by the roadside, in the valleys, everywhere except on the\r\nhillsides. Such quantities of oranges! It seems as if enough of the\r\nfruit is grown in Puerto Rico to supply the whole of the United States.\r\nYet very few oranges are sent away from the island. They can not be\r\nshipped profitably until good roads are built.\r\n\r\nThe city of Mayaguez claims a population of 20,000 people. It has,\r\nprobably, 12,000 to 15,000. It is the great western shipping port, is\r\nthe third largest city, and the prettiest and most attractive city in\r\nPuerto Rico.\r\n\r\nMayaguez is very different in appearance and customs from the other\r\ncities. We can scarcely realize that we are on the same island.\r\n\r\nThe streets are macadamized, wide, shaded by trees, and lined with\r\nhandsome shops and residences. The sidewalks are narrow,--only two can\r\nwalk abreast on them.\r\n\r\nThe town is well provided with public buildings. It has also three\r\nhospitals, a home for the destitute, a public library, good waterworks,\r\nis lighted by electricity, and possesses the only street-car line on the\r\nisland. The principal plaza is a park of grand old shade trees. It\r\ncontains a majestic statue of Columbus.\r\n\r\nThe citizens are, many of them, coffee planters who have estates near\r\nthe city. Each family of the better class dwells in a home of its own,\r\ninstead of living in second stories.\r\n\r\nThe poor people of the town are not so poor, or unclean, or shiftless,\r\nas the poorer classes at the capital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VIEW IN PONCE, PUERTO RICO.]\r\n\r\nPONCE.\r\n\r\nTo reach Ponce, the next city we wish to visit, we must use carriages as\r\nwell as railways. It is on the southern side of the island.\r\n\r\nPonce is the largest city in Puerto Rico, having a population of over\r\nthirty-seven thousand people. The main part is built on a plain about\r\nthree miles from the seashore.\r\n\r\nA fine road connects it with Playa, the port, where are found a good\r\nharbor, large wharves and the more important government offices.\r\n\r\nPonce has wide, clean streets, handsome buildings, and attractive homes.\r\nMany quaint and picturesque old buildings line its avenues; but in the\r\nnewer parts of the town and in the suburbs the buildings are modern.\r\n\r\nIt has a military hospital and barracks, two other hospitals, a home for\r\nthe old and poor, gas works, and an ice machine. There are also\r\nestablishments for hulling coffee, drying coffee, distilling rum,\r\nmanufacturing carriages, and grinding sugar. (See illustrations on pages\r\n54 and 69).\r\n\r\nThe large central plaza has pretty gardens and a cathedral.\r\n\r\nThere are three manufactories of chocolate for the use of the people in\r\nthe surrounding country. Sugar, coffee, oranges, pineapples and\r\ncocoanuts are brought here to be shipped to the United States and other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nNear the city are white-gypsum quarries; also medicinal baths, to which\r\nmany invalids and travelers go.\r\n\r\nThe only Protestant church in the West Indies is the Episcopal church\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nOn the outskirts of Ponce is an old cemetery, in which many famous\r\nPuerto Ricans of an early day were buried. It is quite different from\r\nour idea of a cemetery. It is one solid mass of masonry built into the\r\nside of a hill. In this are narrow vaults, one above the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FUNERAL PROCESSION.]\r\n\r\nThe openings of these vaults look much like bakers\' ovens. The bottom\r\nvaults are used first, and when a body is laid in one of them it is\r\nsealed up and the name of the deceased graven on the outside. The next\r\nmember of the family who dies is placed in the vault above; and so on,\r\neach family having a tier of vaults.\r\n\r\nAs carriages and hearses are rare objects in Ponce, the coffin is\r\nsometimes carried on the shoulders of men. The procession is often\r\ncomposed of those attracted by curiosity, rather than the friends and\r\nrelatives of the deceased.\r\n\r\nThe people of Ponce are wide-awake, progressive and anxious to better\r\ntheir condition. They are also more hospitable and friendly than in\r\nother towns.\r\n\r\nIt was here that the American army under General Miles proceeded in\r\n1898, after landing at Guanica. The troops received a hearty welcome\r\nfrom the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe people were glad to be relieved from Spanish rule, and wished to\r\nhave their land annexed to the United States.\r\n\r\nA proclamation of welcome was issued to the soldiers, feasts were\r\nspread, and the stars and stripes floated from many house tops.\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY ROAD.\r\n\r\nNow we are ready to return to San Juan, going northward over the great\r\nmilitary road, one of the finest highways in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is macadamized, is fifty feet wide, ninety-seven miles in length, and\r\nsmooth and even as a boulevard. It crosses mountains which reach a\r\nheight of almost four thousand feet. It winds in and out among the\r\ncoffee-covered hills, giving us a fine view of the green mountains and\r\nthe deep valleys below.\r\n\r\nLooking down we see patches of sugar cane and tobacco; groves of\r\nbananas, cocoanut, and palm trees; hedges of strange growth; unknown\r\nplants and vines, and fern-covered rocks.\r\n\r\nHere and there is a rude cabin surrounded by bread-fruit and banana\r\ntrees. We pass picturesque little towns with blue and yellow houses and\r\nquaint churches, their spires towering upward. In fifteen hours we would\r\nreach San Juan, but we delay our journey in order to obtain a closer\r\nview of the scenery and of the homes of the people.\r\n\r\nMany happy hours we spend on the plantations in the country.\r\n\r\nDuring these country rides and visits we get our knowledge of the animal\r\nand plant life of the island.\r\n\r\nLet us stop, then, for a few days, at a country home by the seashore.\r\n\r\nA COUNTRY HOME.\r\n\r\nThe residence of this home we find to be of good size and divided into\r\nrooms by partitions that reach only half way up to the roof. This is to\r\ngive a free circulation of air. The house is thatched with palm leaves,\r\nand has a wide veranda running around it.\r\n\r\nMosquito curtains are used to keep out the swarms of sand flies and\r\nmosquitoes that make the night uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAll doors and windows are closed before sunset and not opened until the\r\nmoon is well up. Then large fires are lighted around the house to drive\r\nthe mosquitoes away. This is for our benefit, for the natives do not\r\nmind these insects as much as we do. But we have other midnight\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\nLarge fireflies fly in at the open windows and light up the room with\r\ntheir fairy lamps. And such wonderful fireflies, over an inch long!\r\n\r\nThe people, the children especially, are very fond of these fireflies\r\nand frequently keep little cages of them for pets. They feed them on\r\nsugar-cane juice and bathe them as if they were birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNTRY HOME OF THE BETTER CLASS.]\r\n\r\nLittle crabs rattle gaily over the floor and sometimes crawl into our\r\nshoes, where we find them in the morning; friendly but ugly lizards\r\ncroak from the walls and roof, where they pass the night hours in\r\ncatching insects.\r\n\r\nThese lizards are found in and about most of the houses and are\r\nharmless, useful little fellows. They are six or seven inches long, of a\r\npale, yellowish color, mottled with brown.\r\n\r\nInstead of taking a morning bath in our rooms, we take a dip in the warm\r\nsea water. We find it hot, even very early in the morning; and as we\r\nwalk to the shore in our bathing suits, we make a large palm leaf do\r\nduty as a sunshade.\r\n\r\nWhen we dress for breakfast we examine our clothes very closely, for the\r\ncentipedes have a disagreeable way of taking strolls over one\'s clothing\r\nand the bedding.\r\n\r\nOur breakfast consists of turtle eggs, bread fruit, plantain and\r\ncocoanut milk. Our meals are served on the veranda, and there we spend\r\nthe most of the day. Hammocks are swung from the beams, and, lying in\r\nthem, we drink in the cool sea air and feast our eyes upon the beautiful\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nIn the shallow water near the shore we find great pink conch shells. The\r\nfish in them we have made into soup for our dinner, and very good soup\r\nwe find it.\r\n\r\nSometimes we go out in the mountains with our host hunting for game, or\r\nfor mountain cabbage for our dinner. Perhaps others would like to know\r\nwhat this mountain cabbage is, and we will tell them. It is the bud of a\r\npalm tree, a part of the trunk of which, when young, is edible. When\r\ncooked, it looks like very white cabbage; but the flavor is finer and\r\nmore delicate. It is sometimes eaten raw, as a salad.\r\n\r\nThe meat for our dinner consists of fish, and the flesh of the\r\narmadillo, the agouti and the iguana.\r\n\r\nThese animals are queer looking creatures. As we wish to see them in\r\ntheir haunts in the woods and fields, we will accompany our host on some\r\nlong walks and drives, in order to find out more about them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Columbus visited the West Indies, he was delighted by the beauty in\r\nand about them. "I know not," he said, "where first to go; nor are my\r\neyes ever weary with gazing on the wonderful verdure. The singing of the\r\nbirds is such as to make one wish never to depart."\r\n\r\nThe wonderful beauty of the country of which he spoke is unchanged; but\r\nwe listen and look in vain for the singing birds. The hunter\'s gun has\r\ncaused the disappearance of large numbers of the birds. Those remaining\r\nare found only in the forests.\r\n\r\nColumbus spoke also of the flocks of parrots "whose bright wings\r\nobscured the sun"; but we seldom see the brilliant plumage of these\r\nbirds on our excursions.\r\n\r\nBIRDS.\r\n\r\nThere are said to be about one hundred and fifty kinds of birds on the\r\nisland of Puerto Rico. Among these are the mocking bird, the wild\r\ncanary, the sugar bird, the thrush, the humming bird, the owl, the hawk,\r\nthe dove, the cuckoo, the oriole, the nightingale, and the Guinea bird.\r\nDuring the migrating season, many other birds fly over from other\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nFlamingoes and other water birds are numerous on the coast.\r\n\r\nThere is a parrot market in every port, however, and this is a popular\r\nplace of resort. Here are cool trees and drinking stands, or booths,\r\nwhere cocoanut milk and cool drinks are sold.\r\n\r\nThe birds are not usually confined to cages, but are left to climb\r\nabout the booths. The natives love these birds and make great pets of\r\nthem. The birds are tame and quite accomplished in the art of begging.\r\nWhen the passer-by extends his hand, they walk into it for the sake of\r\nthe gifts which they know will come.\r\n\r\nBut the bird which is oftenest seen is the fighting or game-cock. The\r\nstreets and market places are full of these. They are the pets and often\r\nthe most valued possessions of their owners.\r\n\r\nOTHER ANIMAL LIFE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARMADILLO]\r\n\r\nThe scorpions, centipedes, wasps, sand flies, fleas and mosquitoes\r\nmanage to make things lively for us much of the time.\r\n\r\nOne enterprising and annoying insect, the chigoe, or "jigger," is able\r\nto bore a hole through the sole of a shoe and attack the foot.\r\n\r\nThere are no poisonous serpents or dangerous wild animals in the\r\ncountry; so we travel about through field and forest without fear.\r\n\r\nThe boa, which is occasionally seen, is huge and alarming in\r\nappearance; but it is looked upon as a friend rather than an enemy. It\r\nis of great service to the farmer in clearing his place of rats.\r\n\r\nThe largest native animals we find to be the armadillo, the agouti, and\r\nthe iguana.\r\n\r\nThe agouti is a little animal resembling a rabbit. It lives on vegetable\r\nfood, and finds a home in the rocky hillsides and on the borders of the\r\nwoods. As game is not plentiful, it is sometimes used for food.\r\n\r\nThe armadillo and iguana are preferred for food, however. It is not an\r\neasy matter to catch an armadillo. It has a shell on its back, and into\r\nthis it promptly retreats at the first sign of danger. It has a long,\r\npointed snout and strong, sharp claws. It can dig a hole in the ground\r\nalmost as fast as a man can dig with a pick and spade; so, when an enemy\r\nappears, it digs a hole and buries itself from sight. It is not a\r\ntroublesome animal. It lives chiefly upon beetles, grubs and worms,\r\nwhich it hunts by night.\r\n\r\nThe iguana is a lizard which feeds on fruits and vegetables. It grows to\r\nthree or four feet in length, and is an ugly looking creature. It will\r\nnot fight unless you compel it to do so. It does not live in the water,\r\nbut in trees, bushes, and in the cracks and fissures of rocks. Sometimes\r\nhunters build fires at the entrance of their hiding places and smoke\r\nthem out. The flesh, when cooked, resembles chicken or veal, and is a\r\npopular dish with the natives.\r\n\r\nBut the most delicious meat of all comes from the land crabs and the\r\ncrayfish. These are caught in great numbers when the crabs migrate from\r\nthe mountains to the coast. Once a year they make this journey, for the\r\npurpose of depositing their eggs in the sand.\r\n\r\nThe sea fisheries are important to the people of Puerto Rico. The coast\r\nwaters and fresh water streams swarm with fishes of strange shapes and\r\ngaudy colors.\r\n\r\nAmong these are the shad, sardines, Spanish mackerel, dolphins, flying\r\nfish, sting rays and sharks. The sponge, the manatee and the whale are\r\nalso found near the island.\r\n\r\nSuppose some one were to ask you to what kingdom the sponge belonged.\r\nCould you tell? Many years ago people believed that it belonged to the\r\nvegetable kingdom; but it is now known to belong to the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe animals attach themselves to rocks, shells and other hard substances\r\nbelow water.\r\n\r\nMussels, clams and sponges are cultivated to some extent. Mollusks are\r\nuseful in many other ways than as food. Their shells are used for making\r\nbuttons, parasol handles and shirt studs. Sometimes they are used for\r\nmaking roads. Many shiploads of these shells are brought to New York\r\nfrom Puerto Rico and other parts of the West Indies every year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPuerto Rico seems to us to be one big flower garden. All kinds of fruit\r\ngrow wild and most wild plants blossom and bear fruit several times a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nCultivated fruits, flowers and vegetables are planted several times a\r\nyear in order that a fresh supply may always be at hand. Flowers bloom\r\nevery month of the year, but are most plentiful in June. Ferns, in some\r\ninstances, grow to spreading trees, with graceful drooping fronds. Many\r\nplants have colored leaves which are as brilliant as the flowers\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRANCH AND FRUIT OF THE CACAO TREE.]\r\n\r\nEverywhere grow trees and shrubs valuable for their fruit or for their\r\nmedicinal qualities.\r\n\r\nThe leading crops are sugar cane, coffee and tobacco. Over one-half of\r\nthe exports consists of coffee, and a little less than one-fourth, of\r\nsugar. Cacao and fruits make a large part of the remainder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PUERTO RICAN SUGAR MILL.]\r\n\r\nRice forms the chief food of the laboring classes, and this grows, not\r\non the wet lowlands, as in our country, but on the mountain sides.\r\n\r\nBananas and plantains are two of the important food products. Next to\r\nthese, the yam and the sweet potato form the diet of the natives.\r\n\r\nAmong the fruit trees we find cocoanut palms, tamarinds, prickly pears,\r\nguavas, mangoes, bananas, oranges, limes, cacao (or cocao) trees and\r\nlemons.\r\n\r\nAmong the spices found here are the pimento, or allspice, nutmeg, clove,\r\npepper, mace, cinnamon, ginger, and vanilla.\r\n\r\nThe hills are covered with forests, which, yield valuable timber and dye\r\nwoods. Among these are mahogany, cedar, ebony, and lignum-vitae trees.\r\nLogwood and other dye materials are common.\r\n\r\nMany varieties of the palm flourish here,--the cocoanut palm producing\r\nfruit in greater abundance than in any other country of the West Indies.\r\n\r\nTHE COCOA PALM.\r\n\r\nThe most abundant cocoanut groves in the world are said to be found on\r\nPuerto Rico and the other islands of the Antilles. This tree usually\r\ngrows near the coast, for it loves the salt water; but it is sometimes\r\nfound on the hill slopes a short distance inland.\r\n\r\n"The tree grows to a height of from sixty to eighty feet, lives a\r\nhundred years, bears a hundred nuts each year, and is said to have a\r\nhundred uses for man."\r\n\r\nThe trees bear such heavy burdens of fruit that it seems impossible that\r\nso slender a trunk could hold such a weight of fruit in the air. The\r\nfruit is expensive when it comes to us, because of the difficulty in\r\nclimbing the trees, gathering the nuts, and removing from them the heavy\r\nfibrous husks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATHERING COCOANUTS.]\r\n\r\nHere is a negro gathering cocoanuts. Let us watch him. He climbs the\r\ntall tree, dragging a rope after him. About his waist is a belt in which\r\nis thrust a machete.\r\n\r\nHe hacks off a bunch of the nuts and attaches it to the end of the rope.\r\nIt is then lowered to another negro or to the ground. The nuts are in\r\nbunches of a dozen or two, and are covered with a green, smooth, shining\r\ncovering.\r\n\r\nAfter the bunches of nuts are all removed from the tree, the climber\r\nthrows down the rope and comes down hand over hand.\r\n\r\nThese nuts are so large that a single one often yields two glasses of\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nWe found that the natives made boats and furniture, as well as houses,\r\nfrom the trunk of this palm tree. They extract from its roots a remedy\r\nfor fever. The foot stalks of the leaves are made into combs. The leaves\r\nare used for thatching huts and in making baskets, mats and hats.\r\n\r\nThe fibrous material at the base of the foot stalks is used for sieves,\r\nand woven into clothing. A medicine is made from the flowers, and from\r\nthe flower-stalks palm wine is made. From the juice is made sugar and\r\nvinegar. From the fruit or nut, water, jelly and meat are obtained. Oil\r\nis extracted from the kernel; and the refuse is used for food for fowls\r\nand cattle, as well as for manure.\r\n\r\nFrom the husks ropes, brooms, brushes, and bedding are made. The shells\r\nare used as lamps, cups, spoons, and scoops.\r\n\r\nIt has been called the poor man\'s tree because it gives him food, drink,\r\nmedicine and material with which to build his home.\r\n\r\nThe tropics could not do without the palm. It is more to that region\r\nthan the pine is to the north.\r\n\r\nTHE CALABASH TREE.\r\n\r\nAnother very useful tree to the natives is the calabash, or gourd tree.\r\nIt provides him with many household utensils. In height and size it\r\nresembles an apple tree. Its leaves are wedge-shaped and its flowers are\r\nlarge, whitish and fleshy.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is something like a gourd and often a foot in diameter. The\r\nshell of the fruit is so hard that it is not easily broken by rough\r\nusage or burnt by exposure to fire. It is used instead of bottles, cups,\r\nbasins, dishes, pots and kettles, and to make musical instruments.\r\n\r\nSometimes the calabashes are polished, carved, dyed or otherwise\r\nornamented. The pulp of the fruit is used as a medicine.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAVELER\'S TREE.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious and beautiful trees on the island is the\r\ntraveler\'s tree. It is so named because it contains in its leaves and at\r\ntheir bases a large quantity of pure water.\r\n\r\nBy piercing the leaves with a spear or pike the water is drawn out, and\r\nfound cool and refreshing. It often relieves the thirst of the traveler\r\nin this warm country.\r\n\r\nBREAD FRUIT.\r\n\r\nAmong the fruit products used in large quantities are the bread-fruit\r\nand bread-nuts. These trees grow very large and have wide-spreading\r\nbranches about fifty feet from the ground.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are, very broad, and the fruit looks something like an ovoid\r\nosage orange as large as one\'s head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREADFRUIT.]\r\n\r\nThe fruit is best when picked green, and baked in an oven or in the\r\nashes, after paring away the outer skin or rind. When done it resembles\r\na browned loaf of bread. It is very good and, wholesome, too; but it\r\ntastes more like baked plantain than bread.\r\n\r\nThe bread-nuts look on the outside like the bread-fruit, but the inside\r\ncontains a great mass of closely packed nuts like large chestnuts. These\r\nare not good raw, but are fine when baked or boiled.\r\n\r\nANNOTTO.\r\n\r\nWe have often heard people speak of butter and cheese being colored, but\r\ndid not know that the dairyman was obliged to send to the West Indies\r\nfor his dye. The bush which provides it is called the annotto or\r\nannatto. It grows to the size of the quince tree. The leaves are\r\nheart-shaped; and the rosy flowers are followed by fuzzy red-and-yellow\r\npods, something like chestnut burs.\r\n\r\nThese small burs are filled with a crimson pulp containing many seeds.\r\nThis pulp is immersed in water a few weeks, strained and boiled to a\r\npaste. The paste is made into cakes and dried in the sun. Then it comes\r\nto our country and appears upon our tables in butter or cheese.\r\n\r\nCan you tell me where bay rum comes from? We have often wondered, and\r\nfind here an answer to the question. It is furnished by the bay tree,\r\nwhich grows here. The leaves are distilled and the oil extracted from\r\nthem to furnish this perfume for the bath.\r\n\r\nSPICES.\r\n\r\nSpices, in some form, are served every day upon our table; yet few of us\r\nknow where they come from, or where, how, or upon what they grow.\r\n\r\nWe have heard of the Spice Islands, perhaps, and we just take it for\r\ngranted that they all grow there. We are very much surprised, then, to\r\nfind many of the spices in Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nALLSPICE, OR PIMENTO.\r\n\r\nThe pimento spice is native to this soil. The groves of these trees are\r\nbeautiful. The trees grow to a height of thirty feet, their stems are\r\nsmooth and clean, and their leaves glossy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRANCH AND BUD OF PIMENTO (ALL-SPICE).]\r\n\r\nThe trees bear fruit when about seven years old. The berries are\r\ngathered green and dried in the sun. The branches to which the berries\r\nare attached are broken off by boys and thrown to girls and women, who\r\npick off the berries, and take them to the drying places. One tree\r\nsometimes bears a hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThe tree likes the hills and mountains along the sea, a hot climate and\r\na dry atmosphere.\r\n\r\nTHE NUTMEG TREE.\r\n\r\nThe nutmeg tree grows to a height of thirty to fifty feet. The ripe\r\nfruit looks somewhat like the apricot on the outside. It bursts in two\r\nand shows the dark nut covered with mace, a bright scarlet. This is\r\nstripped off and pressed flat. The shells are broken open when perfectly\r\ndry, and the nuts powdered with lime to prevent the attacks of worms.\r\n\r\nThe tree bears the sixth or seventh year,--the nuts becoming ripe six\r\nmonths after the flower appears. Twenty thousand nuts are sometimes\r\ngathered from one tree.\r\n\r\nOther important growths we find to be pepper, which begins to bear when\r\nfive years old and may bear for thirty years; the vanilla bean, which\r\nproves to be very profitable when properly cared for; and cacao, which\r\nrequires eight years to come to full fruitage, but is an invaluable\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nMINERALS.\r\n\r\nPuerto Rico has no mines or minerals of any consequence, except a little\r\niron. Foundries for magnetic iron have been established at Ponce, San\r\nJuan and Mayaguez.\r\n\r\nGold, silver, copper and coal are known to exist in small quantities\r\nbeneath the surface, but not in sufficient amount to be mined.\r\n\r\nThe island is well supplied with limestone, which makes an excellent\r\nbuilding material. Marble, also, is easily obtained. Along the coast are\r\noccasional marshes where salt is prepared for market.\r\n\r\nOUR JOURNEY\'S END.\r\n\r\nOur month in Puerto Rico is drawing to a close, and the good ship which\r\nis to bear us homeward is waiting in the harbor.\r\n\r\nWe make a last farewell tour of the shops in San Juan, and buy a few\r\ngifts for the friends at home: a green parrot to please sister; a\r\ntortoise-shell comb for mother; a cane for father, a native hat for\r\nbrother, and a calabash drinking bowl for the school museum.\r\n\r\nIt is with reluctant steps that we make our way to the ship. The clear\r\nsky, the perfect climate, the constant verdure, the wonderful plants and\r\ntrees, and the beautiful mountain scenery make Puerto Rico one of the\r\nmost attractive lands to be found anywhere.\r\n\r\nAlthough the roads are in a deplorable condition, a new system has been\r\nplanned, and will probably be soon completed.\r\n\r\nThough the country may lack school buildings, the cities and towns are\r\nbetter provided with other public buildings than most places of the same\r\nsize in the United States. And the eagerness with which the people seize\r\nupon the statements that their children are to be given the same\r\nopportunity for an education as children in the United States have,\r\nindicates that the schoolhouses will soon dot the island.\r\n\r\nThe streets of the smallest villages are paved, and all contain some\r\nplace of recreation and attempts at ornamentation. Each village has one\r\nor more public squares laid out with trees, walks, flowers, seats, and\r\nusually with a band stand in the center.\r\n\r\nWe do not find these improvements in all our own small towns. But the\r\npeople need better schools, more nourishing food, and improved methods\r\nof farming. Sanitary measures need to be introduced into the homes and\r\ncommunities. Harbors need to be dredged, that ships may come closer to\r\nland. The water power of many rushing streams needs to be chained and\r\nmade to generate electricity, to grind corn, to hull coffee, to cook\r\nfood, to pull cars, and to light cities.\r\n\r\nThere should also be fountains, baths, and sewers; the land in certain\r\nsections should be irrigated, and the streams should be bridged, that\r\nmeans for travel and transportation may be afforded.\r\n\r\nPerhaps all this will be done, ere we visit this island again. At any\r\nrate, we sincerely hope that this may be the beginning of a new and\r\nbetter day for Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRONOUNCING VOCABULARY.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  "Our New Possessions," by Trumbull White.

From them the child comes to feel a sympathetic interest in the\r\nways of people unlike those he knows.\r\n\r\nBy emphasizing the idea of continuity of beliefs and customs, we impress\r\nthe child with the most important lesson history and geography hold for\r\nhim,--that all countries and peoples are closely related and have mutual\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n"The acquisition of this feeling of the inter-relationship of the\r\nnations of the world, while starting the child out with a broad view of\r\nlife, will in no wise lessen his love for his own country."\r\n\r\nToo often the lonely little stranger in our midst--the foreigner--is\r\nviewed with heartless curiosity, or contempt, and subjected to ridicule.\r\nPatriotism to many a child means nothing more than a belief that our own\r\ncountry is the best, our own people the smartest, and that we can whip\r\nany and every other nation on the globe.\r\n\r\nDo the children know that the "blood that boils so hotly against other\r\ncountries is drawn from the very same sources that feed the veins of our\r\nseemingly alien neighbors"?\r\n\r\nIf any teacher imagines that her pupils have a definite idea of the\r\nmeaning of patriotism because they are able to sing "America" and the\r\n"Star-Spangled Banner," let her read Marion Hill\'s story, entitled "The\r\nStar-Spangled Banner," in McClure\'s Magazine for July (1900).\r\n\r\nTHE TRAVEL CLASS.\r\n\r\nNothing in the study of geography is more interesting or helpful to\r\npupils than the taking of imaginary journeys. It makes geography a\r\n_live_ subject.\r\n\r\nSuggest that your pupils organize a Travel Club, and that some of the\r\ntrips be personally conducted.\r\n\r\nMaps and a globe should be in constant use. The home should be the\r\nstarting point. Railroad circulars, maps, and time-cards for free\r\ndistribution will be found valuable. Pupils should be taught _how to\r\nuse_ these maps and time cards.\r\n\r\nGive pupils a choice as to routes or roads over which they are to\r\ntravel. Each pupil, however, should be able to give a reason for his\r\npreference for any particular road, and must know the number of miles\r\nand the time required for the journey. The road or route voted upon by\r\nthe majority may then be decided upon, and preparations made for the\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nFind out the best time to go to each particular country, and the reason.\r\nWhat clothes it will be best to wear and to take with one. About how\r\nmuch money it will be necessary to spend on such a trip, and when and\r\nwhere this money should be changed into the coin or currency used in the\r\ncountry we expect to visit.\r\n\r\nA _Guide_ may be appointed to obtain time-tables, maps, railroad guides,\r\nthe little books of travel, or other descriptions of routes and of the\r\nparts of the country that are to be visited. (Further suggestions in\r\nregard to these "helps" will be found elsewhere in this book.)\r\n\r\nThe principal features of the country passed through may be described,\r\nif time permits; also the more important cities. Note the population,\r\noccupations, productions, together with anything of special interest or\r\nhistorical importance associated with the city or locality.\r\n\r\nThe _Guide_ takes charge of the class in the same way that a tourist\r\nguide would do. He escorts us from the home depot to the city, state, or\r\ncountry, pointing out the route on a map suspended before the class.\r\n\r\nArriving at the city or country, he takes us to the various points of\r\ninterest, telling as much about each as he is able, and answering\r\nquestions pupils may wish to ask. If the guide can not answer all\r\nquestions, the teacher or some other member of the party may.\r\n\r\nWhen the guide has finished with a topic or section, other members of\r\nthe party may give items of interest concerning it.\r\n\r\nA different pupil may act as guide to each city or part of the country\r\nvisited, and each pupil should come to the class with a list of\r\nquestions about the places.\r\n\r\nEvery pupil in the class may take some part, either as guide, or as the\r\nclass artist, musician, librarian, historian, geographer, geologist,\r\nbotanist, zoologist, or man of letters.\r\n\r\nA _Historian_ may tell us of the history of the country, and answer all\r\nquestions of historical interest.\r\n\r\nA _Geographer_ may tell of the location on the globe, of the natural\r\nland formations of mountains, ca\xc3\xb1ons, prairies, rivers, etc., and of the\r\nclimate resulting from these. He should illustrate his remarks.\r\n\r\nA _Geologist_ may assist, and show specimens of minerals and fossils, or\r\npictures of these.\r\n\r\nA _Botanist_ may tell us of native plants, useful or ornamental, and\r\nshow pictures of these if possible. A _Zoologist_ tells of the native\r\nanimals, their habits and uses.\r\n\r\nThe geographer, geologist, botanist, and zoologist direct the work at\r\nthe sand table, and assist in reproducing the country in miniature.\r\n\r\nThe _Merchants_ and _Tradesmen_ tell us of the products for which their\r\ncountry is noted, and show samples of as many as it is possible to\r\nsecure. They also tell what they import, and why.\r\n\r\nA _Librarian_ or Correspondent may visit the library for information\r\nsought by the club. He must be able to give a list of books of travel,\r\nand be ready to read or quote extracts referring to the places visited\r\non the tour.\r\n\r\nHe or his assistant may also clip all articles of interest from papers,\r\nmagazines, and other sources, and arrange these, as well as the\r\narticles secured by other pupils, in a scrapbook, devoted to each\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe _Artist_ and his assistant may tell us about the famous artists and\r\ntheir works, if any. He may illustrate his remarks with pictures, if he\r\ncan obtain or make them.\r\n\r\nThe _Club Artist_ may also place upon the board in colored crayons the\r\nflag, the coat of arms, and the national flower of the country.\r\n\r\nA _Photographer_ may be appointed to provide or care for the photographs\r\nand pictures used in the class talks. The photographs may often be\r\nborrowed from tourists or others. Pictures may be obtained from\r\nmagazines, railroad pamphlets, the illustrated papers, or from the Perry\r\nPictures, and mounted on cardboard or arranged by the artist in a\r\nscrapbook with the name of the country on the cover.\r\n\r\nIf the members of the travel or geography class are not provided with\r\nthe "LITTLE JOURNEYS," the teacher should have at least two copies. The\r\npictures from one of these books should be removed and mounted for class\r\nuse. They may be mounted on a screen, or on cardboard, and placed about\r\nthe room or grouped in a corner. They should be allowed to remain there\r\nduring the month, that all the pupils may have an opportunity to examine\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnother pupil may collect curiosities. Many families in each\r\nneighborhood will be able to contribute some curio. Pupils in other\r\nrooms in the building will be interested in collecting and loaning\r\nmaterial for this little museum and picture gallery.\r\n\r\nCoins and stamps may be placed with this collection. Begin a stamp\r\nalbum, and collect the stamps of all the countries studied. The stamps\r\nof many countries show the heads of the rulers. One of the most\r\nattractive of these is the United States postage stamp showing "Columbus\r\nin Sight of Land."\r\n\r\nThe album should be kept on the reading table with the scrapbooks, in\r\norder that pupils may have access to it during their periods of leisure.\r\n\r\nDolls may be dressed in the national costume or to represent historical\r\npersonages.\r\n\r\nThis form of construction work may be done outside of school hours by\r\npupils under the direction of the historian and artist. The dolls, when\r\ndressed, may be made the centers of court, home, field or forest scenes\r\narranged on the sand table.\r\n\r\nA _Musician_ or musicians may tell us of the characteristic music of the\r\ncountry, and of famous singers or composers. She may also sing or play\r\nthe national song or air of the country, if there be one.\r\n\r\nThe singer should be dressed in national costume, if it is possible to\r\nsecure it, or to make it out of calico, paper, or some other cheap\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nA _Man of Letters_ may tell of the famous men and women of the country\r\nthrough which we are traveling, and may visit their homes with us. He\r\nmay call attention to the literature of the people and give selections\r\nfrom noted writers, from or about the places visited.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE TRIP.\r\n\r\nWith maps, guide-books, time-tables and notebooks before us, we look up\r\nthe steamer lines and routes and decide when, where, and how to go.\r\n(Good maps will be found in the railroad guide-books).\r\n\r\nCity newspapers publish once a week the lines of steamboats and their\r\ntimes of sailing. The steamboat agents also furnish advertising matter\r\ngiving other necessary and interesting information.\r\n\r\nWhen we have decided upon our route, we telegraph ahead for our\r\nstaterooms. Now let us plan for our baggage. What kind of a trunk must\r\nwe take? Why a steamer trunk? How large must this be? What will we do\r\nwith this trunk when we leave the boat? (We are advised to leave it and\r\npart of its contents at the ship company\'s office. They will store it\r\nuntil we are ready to take the return trip). How many pounds of baggage\r\nare we allowed on the steamer?\r\n\r\nWhat other baggage shall we take (hand bags)? Why not small trunks?\r\n(Because every pound of baggage must be paid for in some countries.)\r\nMany countries have not our convenient system of checking baggage. What\r\nelse will we need? (Traveling rugs.)\r\n\r\nWhat clothes must we take? First, we must take warm clothes for steamer\r\nwear, which may be packed away when we arrive. Then we must take\r\ntraveling suits for train wear, and thin clothing to use after arriving\r\nat our destination.\r\n\r\nWe have promised friends at home that we will inform them of our safe\r\narrival immediately. How can we do this? By mail? Is there not a quicker\r\nway? How many know of the cable? How many have ever sent a cablegram?\r\nCan we cable from Puerto Rico? How much will it cost? Our guide-books\r\ngive us all this information.\r\n\r\nWe must have guide-books, phrase books, toilet articles and writing\r\nmaterials. These should be packed in linen or canvas bags, because more\r\neasily carried about than heavy leather satchels.\r\n\r\nOur guide must be able to speak Spanish, for that is the language of the\r\nPuerto Rican people.\r\n\r\nIf one of our party acts as guide, we must be careful to select a\r\npolite, tactful, and, above all, a patient and good-natured person.\r\nWhy?--Because his patience will be severely taxed many times during this\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nArriving at the city from which we are to sail, we visit points of\r\ninterest, the docks especially, and compare our steamer with others,\r\nlearning what we can about all the ships in the harbor.\r\n\r\nIf our lesson is well planned, we can accomplish a great deal the day we\r\nsail.\r\n\r\nCLASS WORK.\r\n\r\nAfter two or three conversational lessons, let pupils begin their\r\ndiaries (composition books). In these may be written descriptions of\r\nwhat they see, hear, or read about the place being studied or visited.\r\n\r\nIn most schools will be found one or more pupils who have been upon or\r\ncrossed the ocean. Let them give both oral and written descriptions of\r\nthe voyage.\r\n\r\nIn giving accounts of these journeys, have pupils describe the incidents\r\nand details of everyday life on ship-board. They may tell of the ship,\r\nits furnishings, rigging, engines, officers and crew.\r\n\r\nLet them also describe the dining room, the meals, and the manner of\r\nserving.\r\n\r\nThey may further describe a stateroom or berth, and picture their fellow\r\npassengers in words or drawings.\r\n\r\nIt will greatly cultivate their power of expression to tell how the time\r\non board the vessel was passed, and to narrate any interesting\r\noccurrences of the voyage. They may describe the ocean by day and by\r\nnight; also its appearance in a storm.\r\n\r\nMany will be interested in descriptions of the birds that were met and\r\nof the fishes that swarmed about the ship.\r\n\r\nIf time will not permit each pupil to give oral descriptions or to write\r\ncompositions on each topic, assign a different topic to each pupil. Bind\r\nall papers together, when finished, to keep with scrap-books devoted to\r\nthe country visited.\r\n\r\nThese diaries or reproduction stories may be illustrated with pictures\r\nclipped from illustrated papers and other sources or by original\r\ndrawings.\r\n\r\nTry to secure specimens of seaweed to be exhibited to pupils during the\r\nlesson on the sea voyage. Ask pupils to secure ocean shells, sponges,\r\npictures of sea birds, and specimens or pictures of other animal and\r\nplant life in the ocean.\r\n\r\nAFTERNOONS ABROAD.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the study of a country, a topic may be assigned to\r\neach pupil, or selected by him. With this topic he is to become\r\nthoroughly familiar.\r\n\r\nIn place of the old-time review, invitations may be issued by the\r\npupils, and the results of the month\'s work be summed up in the form of\r\nan entertainment, called--\r\n\r\nAFTERNOONS OR EVENINGS ABROAD.\r\n\r\nWhen a class, club, or school has been studying a country, the work may\r\nbe brought to a close in a way that pupils and their parents and friends\r\nwill enjoy and remember, by giving _An Afternoon or Evening Abroad_.\r\n\r\nThis form of geography review would be appreciated more particularly in\r\nvillages, or in country districts, where entertainments, books,\r\npictures, and opportunities for study and social intercourse are rarer\r\nthan in cities.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of an afternoon talk or entertainment, any pictures\r\nused may be placed on the chalk tray along the blackboard, that visitors\r\nmay examine them more closely.\r\n\r\nIf the entertainment is given in the evening, the teacher may be able to\r\nuse stereopticon views.\r\n\r\nThese will prove a very great attraction to both pupils and parents, and\r\nshould be secured if possible. The lantern with oil lamp may be easily\r\noperated by the teacher while the pupils give the descriptions of the\r\npictures or give talks about the country.\r\n\r\nThe lanterns and slides may be rented for the evening or afternoon at\r\nreasonable rates, and the cost covered by an admission fee of from ten\r\nto twenty-five cents. In sending for catalogue and terms, ask for the\r\npaper used to darken windows if the lantern is to be used in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nTwo of the largest dealers in stereopticon views and lanterns are T. H.\r\nMcAllister, 49 Nassau St., New York, and the McIntosh Stereopticon Co.,\r\n35 Randolph St. Chicago.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nFor the afternoons abroad, given as geography reviews, or as a part of\r\nthe Friday afternoon exercises, invitations may be written out by the\r\npupils, or mimeographed, or hectographed, and carried to friends and\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nIf given as an evening entertainment and illustrated by stereopticon\r\nviews, handbills may be printed and circulated, at least a week\r\nbeforehand. The following form may be used:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL ENTERTAINMENT.\r\n\r\nA TRIP TO PUERTO RICO FOR TEN CENTS.\r\n\r\nYou are invited by the pupils of the _____________ school [or the\r\nmembers of the Travel Class or Club] to spend _an evening_ [_or\r\nafternoon_] _in Puerto Rico_.\r\n\r\nThe party starts promptly at 1.30 P.M. [or 8 P.M.], November 1st. Those\r\ndesiring to take this trip should secure tickets before the day of\r\nsailing, as the party is limited. Guides are furnished free.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of this entertainment are to be used in the purchase of a\r\nlibrary, and of pictures and stereopticon views for the school.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA PUERTO RICAN MARKET PLACE.\r\n\r\nDecorate the room with ferns, potted palms and other tropical plants, or\r\npictures of them. (Exact reproductions in paper or other material can\r\nnow be procured at small cost.) On one side of the room have one table\r\ndevoted to Puerto Rican curios; another to fruits and vegetables; and a\r\nthird to other products from the island. (Or fit up one end or corner as\r\na market place in San Juan or Ponce.)\r\n\r\nExplain your plan for the entertainment to your groceryman and other\r\nmerchants most convenient to your school, and enlist their aid. They\r\nwill usually be willing to lend products imported from or native to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFor a list of the fruits and vegetables to be exhibited in the market\r\nplace, see the list given when on a visit to the market place at San\r\nJuan. (See p. 22).\r\n\r\nOn the product-tables arrange pieces of sugar cane, samples of raw,\r\nloaf, granulated, and powdered sugar, and of molasses. If possible to\r\nsecure the stalks of sugar cane, have short lengths to be sold for\r\nconsumption--as in Puerto Rico. Near the table, tack up pictures of\r\nsugar plantations and mills. Have the coffee-berry and beans, ground\r\ncoffee, cups of coffee prepared as a drink, and pictures of the tree,\r\nfruit, and coffee plantations; also secure specimens of the fruit of the\r\ncacao tree, a cake of solid chocolate, chocolate candy, and a cake\r\ncontaining chocolate layers. Cups of cacao or chocolate may be prepared\r\nas a drink. Have near pictures of the cacao tree and fruit.\r\n\r\nSecure, if possible, samples of rice, allspice, nutmeg, mace, cinnamon,\r\npepper, cloves, ginger and vanilla; bottles of clove oil and bay rum;\r\npackages of the annatto and logwood dyes; sponges, tortoise-shell combs,\r\nand articles made of cedar, ebony, or mahogany, or pieces of these\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nThe tables and booths in the market places should be presided over by\r\npupils dressed as Puerto Ricans, and venders should go about the room,\r\nafter the entertainment is over, with native wares to sell.\r\n\r\nAmong these venders will be the bread man, the milk man, the fruit and\r\nvegetable man, the dulce seller, and the vender of ices.\r\n\r\nThese venders should, if possible, carry their wares as the Puerto\r\nRicans do.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTUMES.\r\n\r\nThe girls may be costumed in very simply made white dresses.\r\nHandkerchiefs may be tied about the head, for head coverings.\r\n\r\nThe boys may be dressed in loose white trousers, girdled at the waist by\r\na belt of leather, a white shirt, and a silk or cotton handkerchief\r\naround the neck.\r\n\r\nA broad brimmed hat may be worn.\r\n\r\nThe dulce seller carries guava, pieces of pineapple, preserved fruits,\r\nchocolate candy, fresh cocoanut meat, grated cocoanut, etc.\r\n\r\nThe bread vender carries small rolls on his tray. The milk man carries\r\nhis can upon his head, ready to serve milk from tin cups which are tied\r\nto the sides of the can.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFRESHMENTS.\r\n\r\nThese may be served during an intermission or at the close of the\r\nentertainment, and may consist of the national drinks, orangeade,\r\nlemonade, chocolate, coffee, cocoanut milk, and of rolls, cheese, native\r\nfruits and confectionery.\r\n\r\nThe pupils who serve these refreshments should be prepared to tell\r\nsomething of the way in which these refreshments are prepared and served\r\nin Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nOne of the favorite drinks of the people of Puerto Rico is orangeade.\r\nThis is made as we make lemonade, except that the juice of the orange is\r\nused in place of that of the lemon. In making lemonade they use limes\r\nmore frequently than lemons.\r\n\r\nCoffee and chocolate are drinks also very much in use. The chocolate is\r\nmade about the consistency of thick gruel and served with a light, thin\r\ncake.\r\n\r\nThe coffee is made very strong and only a small amount placed in the\r\ncup. The cup is then filled with boiling milk.\r\n\r\nAmong the favorite sweetmeats are the guava jelly and marmalade. The\r\njelly looks much like our currant jelly; the marmalade resembles quince\r\nmarmalade. It is usually served with cheese.\r\n\r\nSecure some of these sweetmeats for the booth or shop, and serve bits to\r\nthose who wish to buy. The small, flat boxes are the best for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nFresh cocoanut meat should be removed from the shell and divided into\r\npenny squares, that the pupils may be able to buy a bit for a penny.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AFTERNOON IN PUERTO RICO.\r\n\r\nPROGRAMME.\r\n\r\n1.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
