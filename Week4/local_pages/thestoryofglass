She did not live around because nobody\r\nwanted her, however; on the contrary, she lived around because so many\r\npeople wanted her. Both her father and mother had died when Jean was a\r\nbaby and so until she was twelve years old she had been brought up by a\r\ncousin of her mother\'s. Then the cousin had married a missionary and\r\nhad gone to teach the children in China, and China, as you will agree,\r\nwas no place for an American girl to go to school. Therefore Jean was\r\nsent to Boston and put in charge of her uncle, Mr. Robert Cabot. Uncle\r\nBob was delighted with the arrangement, for they were great friends,\r\nJean and this boy-uncle of hers.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner did she arrive in Boston and settle down to live on\r\nBeacon Hill than up rose Uncle Tom Curtis, Jean\'s other uncle, who\r\nlived in Pittsburgh. He made a dreadful fuss because Jean had gone to\r\nUncle Bob\'s to live. _He_ wanted her out in Pittsburgh, and he wrote\r\nthat Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Decker, who was his housekeeper, and had been governess\r\nto Jean\'s own mother, wanted her too.\r\n\r\nThat started Hannah, Uncle Bob\'s housekeeper.\r\n\r\n"The very idea," she said, "of that German woman thinking they want\r\nJean in Pittsburgh as much as we want her here in Boston. Didn\'t I\r\nbring up Jean\'s father, I\'d like to know; and her Uncle Bob as well? I\r\nguess I can be trusted to bring up another Cabot. It\'s ridiculous--that\'s\r\nwhat it is--perfectly _ree_-diculous!" That was Hannah\'s favorite\r\nexpression--"Ree-diculous!" "I\'d like my job," went on Hannah, "sending\r\nthat precious child to Pittsburgh where her white dresses would get all\r\ngrimed up with coal soot."\r\n\r\nBut Hannah\'s scorn of Pittsburgh did not settle the matter.\r\n\r\nInstead Mr. Carleton, Uncle Tom Curtis\'s lawyer, came to Boston as fast\r\nas he could get there and one afternoon presented himself at Uncle\r\nBob\'s house on Beacon Hill. Uncle Bob was in the library when he\r\narrived and the two men sat down before the fire, for it was a chilly\r\nday in early spring. After they had said a few pleasant things about\r\nthe weather, and Uncle Bob had inquired for Uncle Tom, they really got\r\nstarted on what they wanted to say and my--how they did talk! It was\r\nall good-natured talk, for Uncle Bob liked Uncle Tom Curtis very much;\r\nnevertheless Uncle Bob and Uncle Tom\'s lawyer did talk pretty hard and\r\npretty fast, for they had lots of things to say.\r\n\r\nAt last Uncle Bob Cabot rose from his leather chair and going to the\r\nfireplace gave the blazing logs a vicious little poke.\r\n\r\nHe was becoming nettled. Anybody could see that.\r\n\r\n"The Curtises have not a whit more title to the child than I have," he\r\nburst out. "You are a lawyer, Carleton, and you know that. I am just as\r\nmuch Jean\'s uncle as Tom Curtis is; in fact I think I am more her uncle\r\nbecause I am her father\'s own brother. I\'m a Cabot, and so is Jean. I\r\nshould think that ought to be enough. Who would she live with, if not\r\nwith the Cabots?"\r\n\r\nMr. Carleton cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n"You certainly have a strong claim to the little girl," he agreed. "But\r\nyou see my other client puts up an equally convincing story. In fact,\r\nhe uses almost your identical words. He says he is Jean\'s mother\'s own\r\nbrother, and argues no one can have a closer right than that."\r\n\r\n"But what does he know about bringing up a little girl? Isn\'t he an old\r\nbachelor?"\r\n\r\n"You are not married yourself, Mr. Cabot."\r\n\r\n"Well, no. So I\'m not. However, that\'s neither here nor there. Tom\r\nCurtis is fifty if he\'s a day. He is too old to bring up a child,\r\nCarleton."\r\n\r\n"He complains that you are only thirty, and too young."\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Cabot, who was walking excitedly about the room, turned\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n"But I have Hannah. You do not know Hannah or you would feel\r\ndifferently. It is hard to tell you what Hannah is. You just have to\r\nknow her. She is the mainspring of my household. Not only does she\r\ncook, clean, mend, and market for me; she does a score of things\r\nbesides. Why, I couldn\'t live without her. She is one of those motherly\r\nsouls whose wisdom is of the sages. She has been in our family since I\r\nwas a baby. Most of my bringing up, in fact, was due to her and," he\r\nadded whimsically, "behold the work of her hands!"\r\n\r\nMr. Carleton smiled.\r\n\r\n"I cannot deny the product is good, Mr. Cabot. But again, all these\r\narguments you put forth Mr. Tom Curtis also re\xc3\xabchoes in behalf of his\r\nGerman Fr\xc3\xa4ulein. She too has been for years in the Curtis family and\r\nbrought up their children, and Mr. Curtis feels that since she trained\r\nJean\'s mother she is eminently the person to train Jean."\r\n\r\n"Humph!"\r\n\r\n"The claims seem about equal."\r\n\r\n"No, they\'re not. That\'s where you are wrong. Allowing everything else\r\nto be equal even you must grant that there is one serious objection of\r\nwhich you have not spoken. Mr. Tom Curtis lives in _Pittsburgh_! That\r\nis enough to overthrow the whole thing. Pittsburgh! Think of bringing\r\nup a child in Pittsburgh when she could be brought up in Boston.\r\nBoston, my good man, is intellectually--well, of course I do not wish\r\nto appear prejudiced, but you will, I am sure, admit that Boston----"\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Cabot dropped helplessly into his chair, leaving the sentence\r\nunfinished. There seemed to be no words in the English language\r\nadequate to express what, in Mr. Bob Cabot\'s estimation, Boston\r\nactually was.\r\n\r\nMr. Carleton started to laugh, but after glancing furtively at Mr. Bob\r\nCabot he changed his mind and coughed instead.\r\n\r\n"We all grant Boston is without an intellectual peer," he answered with\r\na grave inclination of his head. "Even I, who was born in Indiana,\r\ngrant that, although out in my state we think we run you a close\r\nsecond. Boston moreover has a background of which we in the West cannot\r\nboast--history, you know, and all that sort of thing. It would be a\r\ngreat privilege for little Miss Jean Cabot to receive a home and an\r\neducation in Boston. There are, however, many fine things in\r\nPittsburgh; it is not all soot, or panting factories."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not. Jean\'s mother was a Pittsburgh girl, and certainly she\r\nwas a wonderful type of woman. Yet you cannot tell what result a Boston\r\nenvironment might have had on such a nature as hers. She might have\r\nbeen even nearer perfection. Yet after all she was quite fine enough\r\nfor human clay, Carleton, quite fine enough. And the little girl\r\npromises to be like her--an uncommonly sweet, gentle child, and pretty,\r\ntoo--very pretty. To send her to Pittsburgh--hang it all! Why must Tom\r\nCurtis live in Pittsburgh?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Curtis, as you seem to have forgotten, Mr. Cabot, is the owner of\r\none of the largest plate glass factories in the country. He has built\r\nup a fortune by his business and he is no more ready to hurl his life\'s\r\nwork to the winds and come to Boston to live than you are to toss aside\r\nyour own business and move to Pittsburgh. And by the way, speaking of\r\nbusiness, Mr. Cabot, if it does not seem an impertinent question, what\r\nis _your_ business?"\r\n\r\n"My business? Well, for a good many years my chief business seemed to\r\nbe getting over a bad knee I got when playing tackle on the Harvard\r\nfootball eleven. We wiped up the ground with Yale, though, so it was\r\nworth it. Of late I spend more or less time in seeing that Hannah does\r\nnot feed me too well and starve herself. Part of my business, too, is\r\nto argue with disagreeable old lawyers like yourself, Carleton." Mr.\r\nBob Cabot chuckled. "When I am not doing some of these things and have\r\nthe surplus time I am incidentally an interior decorator. Oh, I do not\r\ngo out papering and painting; oh dear, no! I just tell other people how\r\nto spend a fortune furnishing their houses. I advise brocade hangings,\r\nItalian marbles and every sort of rare and beautiful thing, and since I\r\ndo not have these luxuries to pay for I find my vocation a tremendously\r\ninteresting one."\r\n\r\n"You have set a worthy example in your own house," observed Mr.\r\nCarleton, glancing about with admiration.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve done a little--not much. I like the old landscape paper in\r\nthis library; some of my antique furniture, too, is rather nice. I\r\npicked up many of the best pieces in the South. The house itself came\r\nto me from my father, and I have altered it very little, as I was\r\nanxious to keep its old colonial atmosphere. Hannah and I live here\r\nmost peacefully with a waitress and inside man to help us. With Jean\r\nadded to the household we shall have just the touch of young life that\r\nwe need. I am very fond of children, and----"\r\n\r\n"You seem very certain that Jean is to settle with you, Mr. Cabot. Now\r\nlet me own up to something; although Mr. Tom Curtis sent me to have\r\nthis talk with you and pave the way, it chances--no, chance is not the\r\nright word--on the contrary it is an intentional fact that Mr. Tom\r\nCurtis is at this very moment here in Boston."\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Cabot started.\r\n\r\n"Tom Curtis here!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He is putting up at the University Club, and he wanted me to ask\r\nyou if you would be so good as to dine there with him to-night."\r\n\r\n"So he has come over to enter the fray himself, has he? Well, well! Why\r\ndidn\'t he come right here? Of course I\'ll join him. I always liked Tom\r\nCurtis. The only things I have against him are that he _will_ live\r\nin Pittsburgh--and that he wants Jean."\r\n\r\nMr. Carleton rose with satisfaction. At least part of his mission had\r\nbeen successfully accomplished. He could afford to overlook the slur on\r\nPittsburgh which, as it happened, was his home as well as that of Mr.\r\nTom Curtis.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll call up Mr. Curtis," he said, "and tell him he may expect\r\nyou. Will seven o\'clock be all right?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. I suppose I shall not see you again, Carleton?"\r\n\r\nMr. Carleton hesitated.\r\n\r\n"It is just possible that I may drop in on you and Mr. Curtis after\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see. A plot."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I have some business to settle with Mr. Curtis before I\r\nreturn to Pittsburgh."\r\n\r\n"Going back to that grimy coal hole, are you?" blustered Mr. Bob Cabot.\r\n"How you fellows can live there when you might spend your days in\r\nBost----"\r\n\r\nThe door slammed.\r\n\r\nMr. Carleton was gone.\r\n\r\nShrugging his shoulders Mr. Bob Cabot glanced at the clock. He had just\r\nabout time to dash off a necessary letter, dress, and get to the\r\nUniversity Club.\r\n\r\n"Hannah!" he called.\r\n\r\nA small dark-haired woman appeared in the doorway. She had sharp little\r\nblack eyes that twinkled a great deal, and she had a mouth that turned\r\nup at the corners; furthermore she had a plump figure neatly dressed in\r\ngray, and a white apron tied behind in an enormous and very spirited\r\nbow.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Bob."\r\n\r\n"Hannah, Mr. Tom Curtis is in town with a rascal of a lawyer. They have\r\ncome to see about taking Jean to live in Pittsburgh."\r\n\r\n"Pittsburgh! My soul, Mr. Bob! You\'ll not let her go, of course.\r\nPittsburgh, indeed! Don\'t we know that Boston----"\r\n\r\n"We certainly do, Hannah. Nobody knows what Boston is better than we\r\ndo. But Mr. Tom Curtis unfortunately was not born in Boston."\r\n\r\n"More\'s the pity! Still, I suppose he cannot be blamed for that. It\r\nwasn\'t really his fault."\r\n\r\nMr. Bob Cabot laughed and dropped a big, kindly hand on the shoulder of\r\nthe woman beside him.\r\n\r\n"I will try and impress upon him all that he has missed when I see him\r\nto-night. I am to dine with him at the University Club at seven."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not dining out!" ejaculated Hannah in dismay.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid so."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Bob! And fried chicken for dinner--just the way you like it,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Hannah."\r\n\r\n"And me browning all those sweet potatoes!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m lots more disappointed than you are--truly I am. It can\'t be\r\nhelped, though. Now let me finish this letter and you go and lay out my\r\ndress shirt and studs and things, or I\'ll be late."\r\n\r\nHannah darted from the room.\r\n\r\n"I made you a Brown Betty pudding, too, Mr. Bob!" she called over her\r\nshoulder. "But no matter. There is no evil without some good; your\r\ntrousers are freshly pressed and handsome as pictures--if I do say it\r\nas shouldn\'t. I\'ll lay \'em out for you, and your dinner coat as well.\r\nBut to think of that pudding! Why couldn\'t Mr. Curtis have invited you\r\nthe night the beef stew was scorched."\r\n\r\n                     *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nPromptly on the stroke of seven Uncle Bob Cabot presented himself at\r\nthe University Club, where Uncle Tom Curtis was waiting for him, and\r\nthe two men grasped hands cordially. How big Uncle Tom Curtis looked\r\nand, despite Hannah\'s remarks, how rosy and how clean! And what a nice\r\nsmile he had! The dinner was extraordinarily good. The filet was done\r\nto a turn, and there was just enough seasoning on the mushrooms. As for\r\nthe grilled potatoes, even Hannah herself couldn\'t have improved upon\r\nthem. An old Harvard "grad" came over from the next table and greeted\r\nUncle Tom Curtis, telling him he did not look a day older than when he\r\nwas in college, and in spite of his gray hairs Uncle Tom Curtis seemed\r\nto believe it. Then they talked of the last Harvard boat race; the\r\nwinning eleven; the D. K. E. with its initiation pranks; and the old\r\nprofessors. And after the other man had left the waiter brought coffee\r\nwhich was deliciously hot and cheese that was exactly ripe enough.\r\nUncle Tom Curtis seemed to have no end of stories at which Uncle Bob\r\nCabot laughed until he was very red in the face, and afterward Uncle\r\nBob told some stories and Uncle Tom Curtis sat back in his chair and\r\nlaughed and wiped his eyes and mopped his forehead. Then Uncle Bob said\r\nthat of course the Club was all very well, but he should insist on\r\nUncle Tom\'s tossing his things into his grip and coming over to Beacon\r\nHill with him to finish up his Boston visit.\r\n\r\nThey did not talk about Jean any more that night, but the next morning\r\nafter breakfast they went at the discussion and were just in the midst\r\nof it when who should walk in but Jean herself. She had been spending\r\ntwo or three days with a friend of her mother who lived in the suburbs.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Bob!" she called as she dashed her hat and muff down upon the\r\nsettle in the hall. "Uncle Bob! Oh, I had a perfectly lovely time. And\r\nwhat do you think! Mrs. Chandler has three darling Irish terrier\r\npuppies, and she is going to give me one if you are willing that I\r\nshould have it. You do like puppies, don\'t you? I know you\'d like these\r\nanyway; they are so blinky, and fat, and little."\r\n\r\nTossing her coat on top of the hat and muff she ran up the front stairs\r\nand into the library.\r\n\r\n"Why, Uncle Tom Curtis!" she cried. "Whatever brought you here?"\r\n\r\nFluttering to the big man\'s side she gave him a prodigious hug and at\r\nthe same time dropped a butterfly kiss on the top of his shiny bald\r\nhead. The next instant she was perched on the arm of Uncle Bob\'s chair,\r\neyeing her two uncles expectantly.\r\n\r\n"You both look so hot and so--well, almost cross, you know. What is the\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\n"We are talking about you, honey," ventured Uncle Bob after a short,\r\nuneasy silence.\r\n\r\n"About _me_! And it makes you look as solemn and ruffled up as this?\r\nWhatever have I done? Did Mrs. Chandler telephone you about the puppy?\r\nDon\'t worry. I do not mind if I don\'t have it--really I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"No, dear, it wasn\'t the puppy. You shall have all the puppies you want\r\nso far as I\'m concerned," Uncle Bob answered, stroking the tiny hand\r\nthat nestled in his. "No, your Uncle Tom and I were talking about where\r\nyou are to live."\r\n\r\n"But I thought I was to live here."\r\n\r\n"I thought so too," agreed Uncle Bob. "Uncle Tom, though, is not\r\nsatisfied with that arrangement. He says he wants you to come and live\r\nwith him."\r\n\r\n"But I couldn\'t leave you, Uncle Bob--you know that; at least, not for\r\nall the time. If there were only two of me and I could live with each\r\nof you how nice it would be. Of course I\'d love to be with Uncle Tom\r\nsometimes. Why couldn\'t I live with one of you part of the time and\r\nwith the other the rest of the year? I\'d rather be here in the summer,\r\nthough, I think, because it\'s near the ocean."\r\n\r\nHow simple the great tangle over which the two men had argued suddenly\r\nseemed!\r\n\r\n"Jean has settled it herself!" Uncle Tom exclaimed. "It shall be\r\nPittsburgh winters and Boston summers. I wonder we didn\'t solve it that\r\nway in the beginning."\r\n\r\nSo everybody was pleased. Even Hannah admitted that if that was the\r\nbest that could be done she would put up with it; but she made Uncle\r\nTom Curtis promise to lay in a big supply of soap.\r\n\r\n"You must scrub her face and hands three times a day, and at least once\r\nbetween meals if she is to live in Pittsburgh," remarked she. "And\r\nplease remember to have the grime soaked out of her white dresses, Mr.\r\nCurtis. Borax and a little ammonia will do it," she concluded\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n"We will wash not only the clothes in ammonia water, but Jean if you\r\nsay so, Hannah," promised Uncle Tom.\r\n\r\nAt this everybody laughed.\r\n\r\nThen by and by they had luncheon, and Uncle Tom Curtis said it was a\r\nmuch better meal than he had had at the Club the night before; and\r\nHannah said that maybe Pittsburgh was not so black as it was painted;\r\nand Uncle Bob said he\'d send the inside man to the Chandlers\' to get\r\nthe puppy that very afternoon. And he did. And the puppy came, and he\r\nwas very small, and very fat, and very wobbly. His head was much too\r\nlarge for him and so were his feet.\r\n\r\n"You must name him Beacon Hill and call him Beacon for short, Jean,"\r\nsaid Uncle Tom Curtis--which, coming from Uncle Tom Curtis, who thought\r\nthere was no place on earth like Pittsburgh, was a generous\r\ncondescension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nJEAN HAS A SURPRISE AND GIVES ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Tom Curtis returned to Pittsburgh the next day, leaving Jean and\r\nBeacon to stay with Uncle Bob until October. It was now April, and on\r\nthe Common and Public Garden the trees, which were beginning to break\r\ninto delicate foliage, were invaded by scores of scampering gray\r\nsquirrels so tame that they would eat out of one\'s hand. Often in the\r\nmorning when Jean walked to the office with Uncle Bob she would stop to\r\nfeed these hungry little creatures and also the flocks of friendly\r\npigeons clustering along the walks. Of course Beacon had to be left\r\nbehind when the family went on such strolls, for he was far too fond of\r\nchasing everything he saw; afternoon was his gala time. Then, while\r\nJean flew on roller skates along the broad asphalt Esplanade bordering\r\nthe Charles River, Beacon would race up and down dodging the skaters,\r\nplaying with the children, and nearly tripping up the throngs of\r\nnurse-maids who trundled their wee charges in the bright sunshine.\r\n\r\nHow quickly the days passed!\r\n\r\nAlready the Beacon Hill house had become a real home, and Uncle Bob\r\ndearer each moment she stayed in it.\r\n\r\n"You know, Uncle Bob, you would be really perfect if only you liked\r\ndolls and could tie hair ribbons," said Jean teasingly.\r\n\r\nUncle Bob shook his head ruefully.\r\n\r\n"I never could care for sawdust people," said he, "when there were so\r\nmany interesting real ones in the world. As for the hair ribbons,\r\nperhaps I might learn to tie those in time, although I doubt if I ever\r\ncould make as perky a bow as Hannah does. I like the _perk_ but I\r\nhaven\'t the faintest idea how to get it."\r\n\r\nJean laughed.\r\n\r\nShe and her uncle had many a joke together.\r\n\r\n"He is better at a joke than Uncle Tom is," confided Jean to Hannah.\r\n\r\nIn fact Uncle Bob joked so much that it was hard to tell when he was\r\nserious, and so one day when he came into the library where Jean was\r\nand swept all the dolls on the couch over into the corner, laughingly\r\ndemanding how Jean would like to go to Europe, she paid no attention to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Seems to me you are not a very enthusiastic or grateful young woman,"\r\nsaid he at last tweaking a curl that hung low on her cheek. "Here I am\r\ninviting you to tour the world with me and all you say is: \'I\'ll think\r\nabout it!\' How\'s that for gratitude?"\r\n\r\n"If you had any intention of taking me I might be more grateful," Jean\r\nanswered, fastening the gown of the doll she was dressing, and holding\r\nher at arm\'s length to enjoy the effect.\r\n\r\n"But I am entirely serious, my young friend; I never was more so. I am\r\nimploring you to go to Italy, for go I must, and I have no mind to\r\nleave you behind."\r\n\r\n"To Italy? To real Italy, Uncle Bob? Do you mean it?"\r\n\r\n"I surely do, dear child. Behold me, solemn as an owl. Ah, now you\r\nbegin to listen. It would serve you right if I should refuse to take\r\nsuch an ungrateful lady. What say you? Should you like to go?"\r\n\r\n"Like it! I\'d love it! I\'ve never been on an ocean trip in all my\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"You may not care to go on another after you\'ve been on this one,"\r\nchuckled Uncle Bob. "However, the fact remains that we are going. I\r\nhave charge of decorating a very beautiful house in the suburbs and I\r\nam going over to Florence to order some marble stairways and\r\nfireplaces. That is my excuse. Incidentally we can make a pleasant trip\r\nout of it and see many places besides Italy."\r\n\r\n"Could we go to Venice?" burst out Jean. "Venice is in Italy, isn\'t it?\r\nI\'d like of all places to see Venice with its water streets and its\r\ngondolas."\r\n\r\n"Yes, honey, you certainly shall see Venice and ride in all the\r\ngondolas you like."\r\n\r\n"Splendid!" cried Jean, clapping her hands. "When can we start? Let\'s\r\ngo right away," and springing up from the couch she whirled toward the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"Slowly, slowly!" protested Uncle Bob. "Come back here to me a moment,\r\nyou flyaway. Many things must be decided before we sail for Italy. In\r\nthe first place there is Hannah; what shall we do with her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Hannah must come along with us," Jean answered. "She\'ll have to.\r\nWe never could think of going to Europe and leaving good old Hannah,\r\nwho is so kind to both of us, now could we? Besides, she has to fix my\r\nhair every morning, and mend my clothes. I\'d be coming to pieces all\r\nover Europe if Hannah didn\'t go."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, that settles it. Hannah goes. I never could consent to\r\nescort a young lady who might drop to pieces at any moment and strew\r\nher belongings all along the route from Italy to Scotland. Now about\r\nEsther, the waitress. She wants to go West and visit her brother; this\r\nwill be just the chance. Suppose we tie a long string to her and let\r\nher go. Then we come to Beacon."\r\n\r\n"Beacon would go with us, of course," Jean replied quickly. "You may be\r\nsure I\'d never leave Beacon at home. I\'d rather not go myself."\r\n\r\n"But, girlie, we couldn\'t very well----"\r\n\r\n"Why, Uncle Bob! You don\'t mean to say you thought of leaving Beacon!\r\nIf you did I simply sha\'n\'t go. That\'s all there is about it. I shall\r\nnever, never be parted from Beacon--never!"\r\n\r\n"Listen, dear. Beacon wouldn\'t enjoy going. We could not get for him\r\nthe food to which he is accustomed, nor would they admit him to the\r\npicture galleries which we shall visit. I doubt if he would even care\r\nfor the gondolas."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m sure he would not like the gondolas," admitted Jean smiling\r\nfaintly, "because Hannah and I tried him on the swan-boats in the\r\nPublic Garden and he hated them; he just barked and snarled all the\r\ntime, and wriggled about so in my arms that he nearly went overboard\r\nand carried me with him."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it! That is precisely the way he would feel on shipboard.\r\nNow my plan is this. We\'ll send him out to Pittsburgh for Uncle Tom to\r\ntake care of until you get back. Then when you go out there in October\r\nyour doggie will be nicely settled in his other home and waiting for\r\nyou. In fact," confessed Uncle Bob a little sheepishly, "I wrote Uncle\r\nTom and asked how he would feel about adding a puppy to his household.\r\nThis is his answer:\r\n\r\n    "\'_European plan excellent. Send Beacon. Next best thing to\r\n    Jean._\'"\r\n\r\n"Dear Uncle Tom! He is awfully good, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is. I fancy he will decide so, too, when he finds all his sofa\r\ncushions torn, and his shoes chewed up," chuckled Uncle Bob. "Let him\r\ntake his turn at it."\r\n\r\nBeacon provided for, the remainder of the European plan seemed simple\r\nenough. To be sure there was Hannah, who at first flatly refused to be\r\nseparated from the golden dome of the State House or from the Boston\r\n"Evening Transcript." At last, however, after much persuasion she\r\nconsented to suffer these deprivations for the common good, and brought\r\nherself to purchasing the necessary clothing for Jean and herself. To\r\nthese she added French, German and Italian dictionaries because, as she\r\nexplained: "We might get lost or parted from your Uncle Bob somehow,\r\nand you never can tell what will happen in those heathen countries\r\nwhere the poor people cannot speak English. How men and women can live\r\nin places where they talk those dreadful languages and use that queer\r\nmoney when they might come over here to Boston----"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Hannah," agreed Uncle Bob, playfully urging her on.\r\n\r\n"And all that strange weather! Why, I read only the other day that in\r\nItaly they just have summer all the year round. So foolish! They never\r\nget any snow at all--think of that! It is such a slack and lazy way to\r\ndo always to be wearing one set of things and never getting out any\r\nwinter flannels. I shouldn\'t know where I was if I didn\'t chalk off the\r\nseasons by my house cleaning, preserving, getting out the furs, and\r\nputting them away. I just know those Italians live without any system.\r\nHow could they be expected to have any when it\'s summer all the time?"\r\n\r\nShe sniffed scornfully.\r\n\r\nIn fact Hannah sniffed a good many times before the great ship which\r\nwas carrying them to Naples docked beneath the shadow of Vesuvius. The\r\nstaterooms she termed little coops, and the berths nothing more nor\r\nless than shelves.\r\n\r\n"When I go to bed, Mr. Bob, I feel exactly as if I was a sheet put away\r\nin the linen closet."\r\n\r\nUncle Bob and Jean both laughed. Hannah kept them royally entertained.\r\n\r\n"As for these clocks that strike every hour but the right one--I\'ve\r\nnothing to say," she went on. "If the captain prefers to ring two when\r\nhe means nine, well and good. He runs the ship and it is his lookout,\r\nalthough I will say it is hard on the rest of us. He explains that it\r\nhas something to do with the watch--whose watch I don\'t know; his own,\r\nI suppose. Evidently he has some queer way of telling time, some theory\r\nhe is free to work out when he is here in the middle of the ocean away\r\nfrom land. Be glad, Jean, that you learned to tell time properly, and\r\nthat you live with people who are content to use the old method and do\r\nnot set themselves up to invent a system that is a puzzle to every one\r\nbut themselves."\r\n\r\nThus Hannah measured every new experience, applying to it the Beacon\r\nHill standard. If it conformed to what was done in Boston it was quite\r\ncorrect, but if it varied in the least it was condemned as\r\n"ridiculous."\r\n\r\nTo Jean, on the contrary, the voyage was one of unending delight. She\r\nproved herself an excellent sailor, and was never tired of playing\r\nshuffle-board on the deck or pacing to and fro with Uncle Bob in the\r\nfresh breeze. And when at last Gibraltar was reached and she actually\r\nbeheld the coasts of Spain, Africa and Italy, her wonder grew until she\r\nsaid she had to pinch herself to be sure she was alive and not\r\ndreaming. It was a journey of marvels.\r\n\r\n"I feel exactly as if I had gone down the rabbit hole with Alice," she\r\nexclaimed, squeezing Uncle Bob\'s arm as they were disembarking at\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\nUncle Bob was in such a hurry to reach Florence that the travelers did\r\nnot stay long in Naples--only long enough to visit the famous Aquarium\r\nwith its myriad of strange sea creatures, and to take a flying glimpse\r\nof the Museum. It was at the latter place that Jean saw the celebrated\r\nNaples Vase which, Uncle Bob told her, was found over a hundred years\r\nago in a tomb in Pompeii.\r\n\r\n"It probably was made by very skilful Grecian workmen about the year 70\r\nA. D. Think how wonderful it is that there were artists living many\r\nthousands of years ago who knew how to make such a beautiful thing.\r\nLook closely at it, Jean, for it is one of the art treasures of the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\nJean looked.\r\n\r\nThe vase, scarcely more than a foot in height, was of dark blue glass,\r\nand had upon it in white a design of delicate Grecian figures.\r\n\r\n"It was first made with a coating of white opaque glass entirely over\r\nthe blue," Uncle Bob explained. "Then the artist with extreme care and\r\nsome sharp instrument cut this beautiful picture of the harvest\r\ngatherers. Notice, too, how the pattern is repeated on the handles. It\r\nis a pity the base or foot of the vase is missing; it was probably of\r\ngold and was doubtless stolen at some time. There is now made in\r\nEngland a kind of pottery called Wedgwood, which has much this same\r\neffect although, of course, it is far less perfectly fashioned."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad I do not have this thing to dust," Hannah observed grimly.\r\n\r\n"Well you may be, Hannah," Uncle Bob retorted, "for the vase is worth\r\nthousands of dollars. There are in the world several very famous glass\r\nvases--this is one; the Auldjo Vase, also from Pompeii and now in the\r\nBritish Museum, is another; and the Portland Vase, which is there too,\r\nmakes a third. The design on the Portland Vase is considered even finer\r\nthan this. We shall see it and I will tell you its history when we get\r\nto London."\r\n\r\nWhat weren\'t they to see!\r\n\r\nJean\'s head was a jumble of fairy anticipations--of Crown Jewels,\r\npalaces, gondolas, famous pictures, and scenes of undreamed of beauty.\r\nThe Tower of London merged itself with visions of Napoleon\'s Tomb,\r\nwhile in and out of her mind flitted fragmentary pictures of Notre Dame\r\nand the Vatican. Everything seemed so old!\r\n\r\n"At first I stood with my mouth open when I was told things were built,\r\nor dug up, or made hundreds of years ago," laughed Jean. "But now I\r\nfind I am growing fussy, and unless a thing is thousands of years old\r\nit scarcely seems worth looking at. How horribly new they must think us\r\nin America! Even Bunker Hill and the State House, Hannah, are very\r\nmodern," she added teasingly.\r\n\r\n"Now, Jean, if this trip to Europe is going to make you turn up your\r\nnose at your native land the best thing you can do is to face round and\r\ngo straight back home," was Hannah\'s severe reply.\r\n\r\n"There, there, you dear old thing! Don\'t worry. I love my America, but\r\nyou should have learned by this time that I never can resist seeing you\r\nbristle. But even you, bigoted as you are, must admit that a great deal\r\nseems to have happened in the world before we on the other side of the\r\nsea were alive at all."\r\n\r\n"Much of it," observed Hannah with dignity, "was nothing to be proud\r\nof, and it\'s as well they kept it on this side of the ocean."\r\n\r\nFrom Naples Uncle Bob whirled his bewildered charges to Rome and then\r\nto Florence, and while he was busy transacting business Hannah and Jean\r\nwere put in charge of a courier and taken to see so many pictures and\r\nchurches that Hannah begged never to be shown another masterpiece or\r\nanother spire so long as she lived.\r\n\r\n"Bless your heart, Mr. Bob, if you were to lean the Sistine Madonna\r\nright up against the table in my room I wouldn\'t turn my head to look\r\nat it. And as for churches--I wouldn\'t accept Westminster Abbey as a\r\ngift. Tell \'em not to urge it on me, for I wouldn\'t take it even if I\r\ncould get it through the customs free of duty. The things I\'d like best\r\nat this very minute would be an east wind and some baked beans."\r\n\r\nBut when they reached Venice and saw their first gondola even Hannah\r\nwas forced to admit that it far outshone the Boston swan-boats. The\r\ntravelers arrived late at night, and on passing through the station\r\ncame out on a broad platform where, instead of cabs and cars,\r\nnumberless gondolas floated, illumined by twinkling lights.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" murmured Jean in a hushed whisper.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a beautiful sight. Before them a stretch of water flooded\r\nby the full moon wandered off into a multitude of tiny canals shut in\r\non either side by murky dwellings of stone or brick. In and out of\r\nthese dim little avenues plied boatmen who shouted a warning in shrill\r\nItalian as they rounded the turns.\r\n\r\nUncle Bob lost no time in summoning a gondolier, and soon the party\r\nwere being swept along by the sturdy strokes of a swarthy Venetian who,\r\nHannah declared in an undertone, looked like nothing so much as a\r\nfull-fledged brigand. She could not be persuaded to take her hand off\r\nher luggage, but sat clutching it with all her strength until she\r\narrived at the hotel. Jean, on the other hand, was too excited by the\r\nnovelty of the scene to know or care what the boatman looked like. Her\r\none fear seemed to be that if she went to bed and allowed herself to\r\nfall asleep the wonderful water streets might vanish forever. It took\r\nall Uncle Bob\'s pleading to make her close her eyes. At last, however,\r\nshe did and when she opened them in the morning her very first thought\r\nwas to fly to the window and see if the canals were still there.\r\n\r\nNo, it was not a dream!\r\n\r\nThere were the moving gondolas, the narrow water streets, and the\r\nglorious dome of Del Salute directly opposite across the sparkling\r\nexpanse of the Grand Canal.\r\n\r\nJean suppressed a cry of delight, and scurried into her clothes.\r\n\r\n"Now, Uncle Bob," she announced at breakfast, "I want to go straight\r\nout in a gondola the minute I have finished my chocolate and rolls. I\r\nthink I am pretty good to stop for them at all. I want to go and stay\r\nuntil noon. May I?"\r\n\r\n"Well, let me think a second, little girl," replied Uncle Bob. "I am\r\nafraid I must run over to the bankers\' directly after breakfast, so I\r\nwon\'t be able to start right away; I can, however, take you later."\r\nThen as he saw Jean\'s face fall he added, "You and Hannah may go early\r\nif you like and come back for me at eleven. How will that do?"\r\n\r\n"It will do beautifully only I wish you could be with us. How shall we\r\nknow how to get a boatman, or tell him where to take us? I am sure I\r\ncouldn\'t, and Hannah\'s Italian is not very good, although," with a\r\nmischievous smile, "I suppose she could use her dictionary."\r\n\r\n"I will arrange everything with a gondolier before I leave for the\r\nbankers\'," Uncle Bob answered. "Now I must be running along. Suppose\r\nthe gondola is here at half-past nine."\r\n\r\n"The earlier the better," cried Jean.\r\n\r\nPromptly at the hour set the gondola glided up to the steps of the\r\nGrand Canal Hotel where Jean and Hannah were waiting. It was an\r\nunusually beautiful gondola, with scarlet curtains and a gilded prow\r\ncarved in the shape of a woman\'s head.\r\n\r\nJean sprang forward, all eagerness, her eyes on the magic apparition.\r\nThen suddenly her foot slipped on the slime left by the tide on the\r\nmarble step, and she would have fallen into the water had not a young\r\nboy, with rare presence of mind, leaped forward and caught her.\r\n\r\nAnother moment and Hannah, white with fright, had the girl in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear child!" she wailed. "My precious lamb! Thank goodness, you\r\nare safe. Think if you\'d been drowned before you had had a chance to\r\nsee Venice at all! But you are quite safe now, honey. Don\'t be\r\nfrightened. Young man," and she turned to the boy, "that was a good\r\ndeed of yours. What is your name? But there--how silly to be asking him\r\nwhen he can\'t understand a word I\'m saying. I forgot no one could\r\nunderstand anything in this queer, upside-down town where the streets\r\nare water when they ought to be land."\r\n\r\nTo her utter astonishment, however, the boy answered in English, which,\r\nalthough slightly broken, was perfectly intelligible.\r\n\r\n"My name is Giusippe Cicone."\r\n\r\n"Say it again," demanded Hannah. "Say it more slowly."\r\n\r\n"Giusippe Cicone."\r\n\r\n"Giusippe," echoed Hannah, "Giusippe Cicone. There! Giusippe Cicone. I\r\ngot it better that time. Giusippe Cicone. Now I have it! Well, Master\r\nGiusippe Cicone, it was very good of you to save this little lady from\r\na ducking in your canal which, if I may be permitted to say so, is not\r\nas clean as it might be. We are very much obliged to you, and here is\r\nsome money to pay you for being so quick."\r\n\r\nThe boy shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I could not take money for saving the se\xc3\xb1orita from the water,"\r\nprotested he proudly. "I was glad to do it. I could not take pay."\r\n\r\n"Well, I thank you very much," Jean ventured shyly.\r\n\r\nHe helped Hannah and the girl into the waiting gondola and then stood\r\non the steps shading his eyes with his brown hand as the gondolier made\r\nhis way to the oar.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you can tell us where we can find you if we should want to see\r\nyou again," called Hannah as the distance between them widened.\r\n\r\n"Certainly. I am at Murano." He pointed across the lagoon to a distant\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n"Murano?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I work there. Every one knows me at the glass works."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "EVERY ONE KNOWS ME AT THE GLASS WORKS"]\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand and was soon lost to sight.\r\n\r\n"I do wonder who he is," speculated Jean, who had now quite recovered\r\nfrom her fright and could smile at the memory of the episode. "And how\r\nstrange that he understood English!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t call it strange," Hannah responded. "English is the only\r\nsensible language, and probably this boy realizes it. I think it speaks\r\nwell for his discrimination."\r\n\r\n"Anyway, he was a gentleman not to take the money; and yet he looked\r\npoor," reflected the girl.\r\n\r\n"One may be a gentleman despite poverty, thank goodness," Hannah said.\r\n"Your uncle will probably insist upon hunting him up and thanking him.\r\nI can\'t see, Jean, how you came to slip that way. Wasn\'t the boatman\r\nholding on to you?" and for the tenth time every detail of the disaster\r\nhad to be gone over.\r\n\r\n"Well, all I can say is that if anything had happened to you I never\r\nshould have dared show my face to your Uncle Bob. And think of your\r\nUncle Tom at home--he would have things to say! They would both blame\r\nme even if it was not my fault," sighed Hannah.\r\n\r\n"Of course it wasn\'t your fault. How could you possibly be to blame if\r\nI was so heedless as to rush ahead without looking where I was going?\r\nI\'m always doing that, Hannah; you know I am. I am always in such a\r\nhurry to enjoy the things I like that I never can wait a moment. This\r\nis a good lesson for me. I just hope the salt water won\'t spoil my new\r\ntan shoes. Come! Let us talk of something pleasanter. Isn\'t it too\r\nperfectly lovely out here? Look back at the shore and see how St.\r\nMark\'s and the Campanile stand out. I know those already, because I\r\nremember seeing pictures of them in my geography. Oh, I am so glad we\r\nare here! I am sure we shall have a wonderful time in Venice even if I\r\ndid begin by nearly drowning myself in the canal."\r\n\r\n"It is all very well to laugh about it now," Hannah answered solemnly,\r\n"but it was no laughing matter when it happened--no laughing matter!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGIUSIPPE TELLS A STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Uncle Bob heard of Jean\'s adventure he lost no time, you may be\r\nsure, in hunting up Giusippe Cicone. A note was sent to Murano asking\r\nthat the lad call at the hotel; and as the following day chanced to be\r\na festa day the glass works were closed and Giusippe presented himself\r\ndirectly after breakfast. He was neatly although poorly clothed, and\r\nhad he had no other claim to Mr. Cabot\'s good will than his frank face\r\nthat would have won him a welcome. Perhaps added to Uncle Bob\'s\r\ngratitude there was, too, a measure of the artist\'s joy in the\r\nbeautiful; for Giusippe was handsome. Thick brown hair clustered about\r\nthe well-formed head; his eyes were of soft hazel; and into his round\r\nolive cheek was steeped the rich crimson of the southern sun. More than\r\nall this, he was a well bred lad--manly, courteous, and proud. When Mr.\r\nCabot began to thank him for his service to Jean the boy made light of\r\nwhat he had done and once more refused to accept any reward.\r\n\r\nUncle Bob\'s curiosity was aroused.\r\n\r\nNever before had he met an Italian who would not take money when it was\r\noffered him.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you would be willing, young man, to tell us more about\r\nyourself," said he at last. "You work in the glass factory, you say.\r\nHave you been long there?"\r\n\r\nGiusippe smiled, showing two rows of dazzling white teeth.\r\n\r\n"So long, se\xc3\xb1or, that I cannot remember when I was not there. And\r\nbefore me was my father, and my grandfather; and before that his\r\nfather; and so on back for years and years. There was always a Cicone\r\nat Murano. For you must know, se\xc3\xb1or, that glass-making has ever been\r\nthe great art of Venice. When paintings began to take the place of the\r\nglass mosaics then came the height of fame for Venetian glass. For you\r\nwill remember that for many years before artists could paint people\r\nmade pictures out of bits of glass, and in this way represented to\r\nthose who had no books scenes from the Bible or from history. Then\r\nwonderful painters were born in Italy and they crowded out the mosaic\r\nmakers, who had previously decorated the churches, palaces, and public\r\nbuildings. The making of glass mosaics died out and it was then that\r\nthe Venetian artisans turned their attention and their skill to the\r\nmaking of other glass things--beads, mirrors, drinking cups, and\r\nornaments. In fact," went on Giusippe, "there soon became so many glass\r\nhouses in Venice that the Great Council feared a terrible fire might\r\nsweep the island, and in 1291, with the exception of a few factories\r\nfor small articles, all the glass houses were banished to the island of\r\nMurano a mile distant where, if fire came, no destruction could be done\r\nto the city of Venice itself. Those factories which were allowed to\r\nremain had to have a space of fifteen paces around them. By the decree\r\nof the Council the other glass houses were torn down."\r\n\r\n"And it was thus that your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather\r\nwas driven to Murano, was it?" queried Mr. Cabot.\r\n\r\n"Yes. He was a member of the guild of bead-makers. For you know,\r\nse\xc3\xb1or, that in those days workmen were banded together in guilds,\r\nand kept the mysteries of their trade to themselves. The precious\r\nsecret was handed down from father to son. So it was with my\r\ngreat-great-great-great-great-grandfather."\r\n\r\nGiusippe drew himself up.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it was a grand thing to be a glass-maker in those days, se\xc3\xb1or!"\r\ncontinued the boy, his eyes glowing. "The members of the guilds were so\r\nhonored in Venice that they were considered equal in birth to the\r\nnoblest families. They were gentlemen. A titled woman felt only pride\r\nin uniting herself with a glass-maker\'s family."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps that is what your great-great-great-great-great-grandmother\r\ndid," Jean said, half aloud.\r\n\r\n"Yes, se\xc3\xb1orita," was Giusippe\'s simple answer. "And they say, too, she\r\nwas beautiful. My ancestor was of the _pater-nostereri_; he was a maker\r\nof beads for rosaries. Then there were the _margaritai_, who made small\r\nbeads; and the _fuppialume_, who made large blown beads. Each man was a\r\nskilled artist, you see, and did some one special thing. The _phiolari_\r\nmade vases, cups, and glass for windows; the _cristallai_ optical\r\nglass; and the _specchiai_ mirrors. No strangers were allowed to visit\r\nthe glass works, and all apprentices must pass a rigid examination not\r\nonly as to their skill, but as to their previous personal history. In\r\n1495 the glass houses at Murano extended for a mile along a single\r\nstreet and the great furnaces roared night and day, so you can imagine\r\nhow much glass was made on the island."\r\n\r\n"My!" gasped Jean breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"Absolute loyalty to the art was demanded of every man engaged in it,"\r\nGiusippe said. "And you can see, se\xc3\xb1or, that this was necessary. Any\r\nworkman carrying the secrets elsewhere was first warned to return to\r\nVenice; then, if he refused, his nearest relative was imprisoned; if he\r\nstill refused to obey he was tracked down and killed. Often glass-makers\r\nwere found in Padua, Ravenna, and other places stabbed through the\r\nheart, and the word _Traitor_ was fastened to the dagger."\r\n\r\nJean shuddered.\r\n\r\n"Do not tremble, se\xc3\xb1orita," Giusippe said. "It was a just punishment.\r\nYou see the Council of Ten felt that the prosperity of the Venetians\r\ndepended upon keeping their art away from all the outside world which\r\nwas so eager to learn it. All knew the penalty for disloyalty. The\r\ndecree read:\r\n\r\n    "\'_If any workman conveys his art to a strange country to the\r\n    detriment of the Republic he shall be sent an order to return to\r\n    Venice. Failing to obey his nearest of kin shall be imprisoned. If\r\n    he still persists in remaining abroad and plying his art an\r\n    emissary shall be charged to kill him._\'\r\n\r\n"In this way the secrets of glass-making were kept in Venice and the\r\nRepublic soon became famous and prosperous. As the reputation of the\r\nVenetian glass-makers spread an immense trade was established. My\r\ngrandfather has often told me of the great numbers of beads which were\r\nsent everywhere throughout the East--sometimes to Africa and even to\r\nIndia. In 1764 twenty-two great furnaces were kept busy supplying the\r\nbeads that were demanded. Frequently, they say, as many as forty-four\r\nthousand barrels were turned out in a single week."\r\n\r\n"Why, I should think that everybody in the world would have been\r\ncovered with beads!" Jean exclaimed, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I can tell you something stranger than that, se\xc3\xb1orita. So popular\r\ndid Venetian glass of every variety become that a foreign prince\r\ncreated a great sensation by appearing in Paris with curls of finely\r\nspun black glass."\r\n\r\nJean and Uncle Bob laughed merrily.\r\n\r\n"I think myself he was silly," Giusippe declared, echoing their\r\namusement. "He, however, was not alone in his admiration for the\r\nbeautiful and ingenious workmanship of the people of my country, for\r\neven as far back as 1400 Richard the Second of England gave permission\r\nto our Venetian merchants to sell glass aboard their galleys, duty\r\nfree; and King Henry the Eighth owned as many as four or five hundred\r\nVenetian drinking goblets, vases, dishes, and plates, some of which,\r\nthey say, are still in the British Museum."\r\n\r\n"We must see them when we go to London, mustn\'t we, Uncle Bob?" cried\r\nJean eagerly.\r\n\r\n"We surely must. All this is very interesting, Giusippe. You do well to\r\nremember so much of your country\'s history," said Mr. Cabot.\r\n\r\n"I am proud of it, se\xc3\xb1or. Besides I have heard it many, many times. My\r\npeople were never tired of telling over and over the story of the old\r\ndays; the golden days of Venice, my father called them. The Republic\r\nmight have retained its fame much longer had not some of our countrymen\r\nbeen persuaded to go to other lands and sell their secrets for gold. It\r\nwas thus that the art of making mirrors was taken into France and\r\nGermany."\r\n\r\n"Tell us about it, Giusippe," pleaded Jean.\r\n\r\n"Why, as I think I told you, the Venetians began to make mirrors as\r\nearly as 1300. Of course, se\xc3\xb1orita, they were crude affairs--not at all\r\nlike the fine ones of to-day, but to people who had nothing better they\r\nwere marvels. And indeed they were both clever and beautiful. For you\r\nmust remember that ages ago there was no such thing as a looking-glass.\r\nMen and women could only see their reflections in streams, pools, and\r\nfountains. Then the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans began to make mirrors\r\nof burnished metal, using bits of brass or bronze often beautifully\r\ndecorated on the back with classic Grecian figures. Rich women carried\r\nsuch mirrors fastened to their girdles or sometimes instead had them\r\nfitted into small, shallow boxes of carved ivory; sometimes too the\r\nmirror was set in a case of gold, silver, enamel, or ebony with\r\nintricate decoration on the outside. That was the first of\r\nmirror-making."\r\n\r\n"How curious!"\r\n\r\n"Later the Venetians experimented and began backing pieces of glass\r\nwith mercury or tin. The surface was first covered with tinfoil and\r\nthen rubbed down until smooth; then the whole was coated with\r\nquicksilver, which formed an amalgam with the tin. It does no harm to\r\ntell you about it now, se\xc3\xb1orita," added Giusippe a little sadly, "for\r\nevery one knows. This process was slow and unsatisfactory, but it was\r\nthe best the workmen then knew. These mirrors they set in elaborate\r\nframes of glass, silver, carved wood, mother-of-pearl, coral, tarsi, or\r\ninto frames of painted wood. Some of them were sent by Venetian nobles\r\nas gifts to kings and queens of other countries; often they were\r\npurchased by royalties themselves. You can see many in the museums of\r\nFrance, Germany, or England."\r\n\r\n"We will hunt them up, Jean," Uncle Bob declared.\r\n\r\n"I\'d love to see them," replied the girl.\r\n\r\n"My father has told me that there were frequent quarrels between the\r\nglass-makers and the mirror-framers because, you see, the framers\r\nwanted to learn the secret of making the mirrors, and the mirror-makers\r\nwere jealous of the skill of the framers and feared the frame would be\r\nmore beautiful than the mirror itself and so overshadow it. Then in\r\n1600 the French stole from our people the secret of mirror-making and\r\nbegan turning out mirrors not only as good, but in some respects better\r\nthan the Venetian ones."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Giusippe, how did they steal the secret?" Jean cried. "How\r\ndreadful!"\r\n\r\n"It was through the treachery of our own countrymen, se\xc3\xb1orita,"\r\nGiusippe confessed. "Yes, sorry as I am to say so, it was our own\r\nfault. The French, you see, as well as the Venetians, had long been\r\nexperimenting with glass-making and since it was considered there, as\r\nhere, an art, many penniless Huguenot gentlemen who had lost their\r\nfortunes took it up; for one might be a glass-maker and still retain\r\nhis noble rank. Such was Bernard Palissy----"\r\n\r\n"The potter!" interrupted Jean. "I learned all about him in my\r\nhistory."\r\n\r\nGiusippe nodded.\r\n\r\n"So? Then you know how he struggled for years to solve the secret of\r\nmaking the enamel he had seen on a Saracen cup. Palissy also made some\r\nfine old stained glass, although few people seem to know this. Many\r\nanother Frenchman tried to discover the Venetian\'s great secret. They\r\nsought to bribe our people to tell the process, but without success.\r\nThen Colbert, the chief minister under Louis the Fourteenth, wrote the\r\nFrench ambassador at Venice that he must obtain for France some\r\nVenetian workmen. The ambassador was upset enough, as you may imagine,\r\nwhen he received the order. He said he could not do it. He dared not.\r\nIf found out he would be thrown into the sea."\r\n\r\n"He ought to have been!" Jean cried. "He would have deserved it."\r\n\r\n"I think so too," Uncle Bob agreed.\r\n\r\n"It would have been far better for Venice had he been drowned in the\r\nAdriatic," Giusippe answered slowly. "But he wasn\'t. Instead he began\r\ncautiously to look about. There are always in the world, se\xc3\xb1or, men who\r\nhave no pride in their fatherland and can be bought with money. The\r\nnext year the ambassador succeeded in bribing eighteen glass-makers to\r\ngo to France and make mirrors for Versailles, the palace of the French\r\nking. And no sooner had these men got well to work and passed the\r\nmystery on to the French than Colbert forbade the French people to\r\nimport any more mirrors from Venice, as mirrors could now be made at\r\nhome. Some of these early French mirrors are now in the Cluny Museum in\r\nFrance, my father told me. In consequence of the treachery of these\r\nworkmen Germany also soon learned how to make mirrors, and the fame of\r\nthe Venetian artisans declined just as the Council had predicted it\r\nwould. But it will be long before any other country can equal mine in\r\nthe making of filigree or spun glass. You will, se\xc3\xb1orita, see much of\r\nthis beautiful work while you are here in Venice."\r\n\r\n"I want to, Giusippe; and I want to get some to take home. May I, Uncle\r\nBob?"\r\n\r\nMr. Cabot nodded.\r\n\r\n"Your story is like a fairy tale, Giusippe," said he.\r\n\r\nThe boy smiled with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"It is a wonderful story to me because it is the story of my people.\r\nAnd, se\xc3\xb1or, there is much more to tell, but I must not weary you. Some\r\nof our filigree glass, it is true, became too elaborate to be\r\nbeautiful. It is simply interesting because it is wonderful that out of\r\nglass could be fashioned ships, flowers, fruits, fish, and decorations\r\nof all kinds. It shows most delicate workmanship. But the drinking\r\nglasses with their fragile stems are really beautiful; and so are the\r\nvases and tazzas from white glass with enamel work or filigree of\r\ndelicately blended colors. It was the Venetians, too, who invented\r\nengraved glass, where a design is scratched or cut into the surface\r\nwith a diamond or steel point of a file. And our mille-fiori glass,\r\nwhich came to us way back from the Egyptians, is another famous\r\nvariety. This is made from the ends of fancy colored sticks of glass\r\ncut off and arranged in a pattern. You will see it in the shops here."\r\n\r\n"I think you Venetians are wonderful!" Jean exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Ah, se\xc3\xb1orita, you have yet to see one of the finest things we have\r\ndone," was Giusippe\'s grave reply. "You have to see the San Marco with\r\nits mosaics!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, we surely want to go there," put in Mr. Cabot. "Do you think you\r\ncould be our guide, Giusippe?"\r\n\r\n"I could go to-morrow, se\xc3\xb1or; because of the festa I am free from work.\r\nI would like to show you San Marco, of all things, because I love it."\r\n\r\n"I am sure no one could do it better," replied Mr. Cabot, well pleased.\r\n"To-morrow at nine, then. We will be ready promptly. You shall tell us\r\nthe rest of your fascinating Venetian history and make Venetians of\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"I will come, se\xc3\xb1or."\r\n\r\n"You shall be paid for your time, my boy."\r\n\r\n"Alas, se\xc3\xb1or! That would spoil it all. I could not then show it to you.\r\nForgive me and do not think me ungrateful. But my San Marco is to me\r\nthe place I love. I show it to you because I love it. I have played\r\nabout it and wandered in and out its doors since I was a very little\r\nchild. I am proud that you should see it, se\xc3\xb1or."\r\n\r\n"As you will. To-morrow then."\r\n\r\n"Yes, se\xc3\xb1or."\r\n\r\nAnother moment and Giusippe was gone.\r\n\r\n"A remarkable boy! A most remarkable boy!" ejaculated Mr. Cabot. "He\r\nknows his country\'s history as I fancy few others know it. Could you\r\npass as good an examination on yours, Jean?"\r\n\r\nJean hung her head.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not."\r\n\r\n"Nor I," Uncle Bob remarked, patting her curls kindly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nUNCLE BOB ENLARGES HIS PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his promise Giusippe came promptly the next morning\r\nand the four set out for the San Marco. It was a beautiful June day.\r\nThe piazza was warm with sunshine, and as groups of tourists loitered\r\nthrough it the pigeons circled greedily about their feet begging food.\r\n\r\n"Why, Uncle Bob, these pigeons are exactly like the ones at home--just\r\nas pretty and just as hungry," Jean said.\r\n\r\n"Should you like to stop a moment and feed them, little girl?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, do! It will make Hannah think of Boston," begged Jean. "But we\r\nhave nothing to give them," she added in dismay.\r\n\r\n"I will find you something, se\xc3\xb1orita," Giusippe declared.\r\n\r\nDarting up to an old Italian who was standing near he soon returned\r\nwith a small paper cornucopia filled with grain.\r\n\r\n"The pigeons of St. Mark\'s are very tame. See!"\r\n\r\nHe put some kernels of corn on the top of his hat, and holding more in\r\nhis outstretched hands stood motionless. There was a whirr of wings,\r\nand in an instant the boy was quite hidden beneath an eager multitude\r\nof fluttering whiteness.\r\n\r\n"I never saw so many pigeons," Jean whispered. "You have many more than\r\nwe do at home."\r\n\r\n"We Venetians are very fond of the birds," was Giusippe\'s reply. "So,\r\ntoo, are the tourists who come to Venice, for they never seem to be\r\ntired of having their pictures taken surrounded by flocks of pigeons."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t this make you think of Boston Common, Hannah?" asked Uncle\r\nBob.\r\n\r\n"Yes, a little. But I should feel more as if I were in Massachusetts if\r\nthere were not such a babel of foreign tongues about me." Then turning\r\nto Giusippe she demanded: "How did you come to speak English, young\r\nman?"\r\n\r\n"I have been expecting you would ask me that," smiled Giusippe. "You\r\nsee, I have an uncle who went to America; yes, to Pennsylvania, to seek\r\nhis fortune. He stayed there five years and in that time he learned to\r\nspeak English well. When he came back he taught me all he knew. Then he\r\nreturned with his wife to the United States, and I got books and\r\nstudied. When they found at Murano that I could speak English they\r\noften called on me to show tourists over the glass works. In this way I\r\npicked up many words and their pronunciation. Since then I have found\r\nthat I could sometimes serve as interpreter for English or American\r\ntravelers if I watched for the chance. I was eager for such\r\nopportunities, for it gave me practice, and I often learned new words."\r\n\r\n"And why are you so anxious to learn English, Giusippe?" Jean\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\n"I hope, se\xc3\xb1orita, to go some day to the United States. My uncle told\r\nme what a wonderful country it is, and I desire to see it. Perhaps in\r\nthat beautiful great land where everything is in abundance I might grow\r\nrich. I now have nothing to keep me here; my parents are dead and I\r\nhave no other kinsmen. I want to join my uncle in Pennsylvania as soon\r\nas I have enough money. Part of my passage I have already saved."\r\n\r\n"Why, Giusippe!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, se\xc3\xb1orita, I am in earnest. It is lonely here in Venice now that I\r\nhave no people. And Murano is not what it was in the golden days of my\r\nancestors. I am sure I could find work in your country if I should go\r\nthere. Do you not think I could, se\xc3\xb1or?" He turned to Mr. Cabot.\r\n\r\n"It is possible," was Uncle Bob\'s thoughtful answer. "Especially since\r\nyou speak English so well. What sort of thing would you like to do?"\r\n\r\n"I know my trade of glass-making," was Giusippe\'s modest answer. "I\r\nknow, too, much of coloring stained glass and of mosaic making. These\r\nthings I have known from my babyhood up. There must be such work for\r\npersons going to the United States. Perhaps my uncle, who is in\r\nPittsburgh with a large glass company, could get me something to do\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Pittsburgh!" exclaimed the other three in a breath.\r\n\r\n"Yes. My uncle is with the company of a Se\xc3\xb1or Thomas Curtis, who has\r\nbeen very kind to him."\r\n\r\n"Uncle Tom! It\'s Uncle Tom!" Jean cried, laying her hand impulsively on\r\nhis arm. "Mr. Curtis is my uncle, Giusippe. Did you ever hear anything\r\nso wonderful!"\r\n\r\n"It certainly is a strange coincidence," agreed Mr. Cabot. "But why did\r\nyour uncle come back, Giusippe, after he once got over there?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, it was this way. He went first alone, expecting when he had enough\r\nmoney to send it back so that the young girl he loved could follow him,\r\nand they could be married. But when at last he had the money saved her\r\nparents became sick. They were old people. She could not leave them to\r\ndie here alone, se\xc3\xb1or. Therefore she refused to go to America, and so\r\nmuch did my uncle love Anita that he would not stay there without her.\r\nBack he came and worked once more at Murano. Then the father and mother\r\ndied, and my uncle and Anita were married and went to the United\r\nStates. They wanted to take me, but I pretended that I would rather\r\nremain here. This I did because I feared that if I went with them and\r\ndid not find work I might be a burden. All this was several years ago.\r\nMy uncle is now a superintendent in one of the Curtis glass factories,\r\nand is happy and prosperous. Still, there are children, and I could not\r\nlet him pay my fare to America. As I said, it will not take me much\r\nlonger to save the rest of my passage money. Then I shall go and\r\nperhaps become rich. Who knows, se\xc3\xb1or!" Giusippe broke into a ringing\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nMr. Cabot made no reply.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking.\r\n\r\nFearing that he had offended, Giusippe changed the subject.\r\n\r\n"But I weary you with my affairs, se\xc3\xb1or. Pardon. Shall we go on to St.\r\nMark\'s?"\r\n\r\nIt was but a few steps across the piazza, and they were soon inside the\r\nchurch. Then for the first time Mr. Cabot spoke.\r\n\r\n"This church, Jean," said he, "is the link between the old art of the\r\nMohammedans and the Gothic art of the Christian era. It was planned as\r\na Byzantine church, and in it one can see many things suggesting St.\r\nSofia\'s at Constantinople. When St. Mark\'s at Alexandria was destroyed\r\nby the Mohammedans many of its treasures fell into the hands of the\r\nDoge of Venice, who promptly proclaimed St. Mark the new patron saint\r\nin place of St. Theodore and set about building a cathedral in which to\r\nput all the beautiful things he had acquired. Some parts of this\r\nancient cathedral remain, but most of the church was built by Doge\r\nContarini between 1063 and 1071. To the next Doge, Domenico Selvo, fell\r\nthe task of decorating it. You see, over here the building of churches\r\ntakes longer than it does at home."\r\n\r\n"I should think it did," answered Jean. "Why, we think it is awful if\r\nour churches are not all done in two years."\r\n\r\nGiusippe smiled.\r\n\r\n"Ah, we build not that way here, se\xc3\xb1orita," he said. "Three centuries\r\ndid our people spend in building into St. Mark\'s the marble carvings\r\nbrought from the East; erecting the altars; and adorning the walls.\r\nThese mosaics alone it took workmen two hundred and fifty years to\r\nfashion. Venice was a rich Republic, you see, and could well afford to\r\nput into this cathedral the money she might have spent on war. Above\r\nthe slabs of marble are the mosaics, se\xc3\xb1orita. So it was in St. Sofia,\r\nmy father told me; the slabs of marble near the ground and the\r\ndecoration above. This whole cathedral of ours is covered on all the\r\nwalls with mosaics--pictures made from bits of glass put together to\r\nform scenes from the Bible or from history. Even the most ignorant\r\npeople who had had no schooling could read such stories, could they\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\nJean nodded.\r\n\r\nShe was dazzled by the beauty of the place--by the soft light; the\r\nwalls rich in gold and color; by the many wonderful things there were\r\nto be seen. She was interested, too, in the smoothly worn, uneven floor\r\nwhich showed where the piles beneath the church had settled.\r\n\r\n"Mosaic makers, you know, Jean, began crude attempts at making pictures\r\nin glass thousands of years ago, for glass-making was familiar to the\r\nEgyptians as well as to the Phoenicans and Syrians. The Greeks and\r\nRomans, too, were great glass-makers. So glass-making came down through\r\nthe ages. The Byzantine churches usually were lighted by a row of tiny\r\nglass windows round the base of the dome. Some of this ancient glass\r\nstill remains in St. Sofia. The common way of making such windows was\r\nto cut a design in a slab of marble or plaster, and then insert small\r\npieces of colored glass. Sometimes, too, a pattern for wall decoration\r\nwas worked out by sticking fragments of glass into soft stucco. So the\r\nfirst mosaic work began. We can see some of it in the museums of\r\nEngland."\r\n\r\n"There seems to be a great deal to see in those London museums, Uncle\r\nBob," Jean gasped.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid you will be more convinced of that fact than ever when you\r\nget there," chuckled Uncle Bob. "But to return to Giusippe\'s mosaics.\r\nYou may remember, perhaps, that when the Mohammedans invaded\r\nConstantinople and found how important a part the glass-makers played\r\nin decorating the churches, they at once handed the artisans over to\r\nthe caliphs, that they might be set to work adorning their mosques. Now\r\nthe Mohammedans believed it a crime to make a copy of either man or\r\nwoman in a picture, a carving, or a statue. It was punishable to pay\r\nreverence to sacred figures; therefore all decoration in their churches\r\ntook the form of flowers, fruit, or conventional designs. So no great\r\nmosaic pictures with figures such as these were made. Between the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries Damascus became the center of\r\nglass-making, and there are in existence in some of the museums old\r\nArab lamps which hung in the mosques with inscriptions from the Koran\r\nengraved upon them. It is Giusippe\'s St. Mark\'s which revived the art\r\nof mosaic making, and served as the bridge between those Pagan days and\r\nthe days when with Christianity the arts revived and mosaic makers\r\nbegan to represent in glass figures of Christ and the saints."\r\n\r\n"And then the painters came, as Giusippe has said," put in Jean.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the great artists were born, and from that time pictures on\r\ncanvas instead of pictures of glass decorated the churches. But the\r\nmosaic makers did an important service to art, for it was they who\r\nindirectly gave to the world the idea of making stained-glass windows.\r\nAnd in Venice those who ceased to make mosaics made instead the\r\nbeautiful Venetian glass of which Giusippe has told us."\r\n\r\n"And are there no mosaics made now, Uncle Bob?" asked Jean.\r\n\r\n"Yes. When in 1858 it became necessary to restore some of the mosaics\r\nin St. Mark\'s, a descendant of one of the old Murano glass workers\r\nnamed Radi, together with a Dr. Salviati, started a factory on the\r\nGrand Canal, where they gradually revived some of the past glory of\r\nVenice. They copied the old time glass products, making Arab lamps such\r\nas hung in the mosques; cameo work similar to the Naples and Portland\r\nvases; and pictures in mosaic. It was they who did The Last Supper for\r\nWestminster Abbey, and the mosaics for Albert Memorial Hall in London."\r\n\r\n"But Salviati\'s mosaics were not like those here, se\xc3\xb1or," put in\r\nGiusippe, "because the San Marco mosaics were constructed upon the\r\nwalls, small cubes of glass being pressed into the moist cement to make\r\nthe picture. This gave a rough, irregular surface which artists say is\r\nfar more artistic than is Salviati\'s smooth, glassy work. When Salviati\r\nsent mosaics away he made them here, and then backed them with cement\r\nso they could be placed on a slab of solid material and transported\r\ngreat distances from Venice. His pictures, it is true, were far more\r\nperfectly done than were the old mosaics--too perfectly, I have heard\r\nglass experts say."\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly they are right, Giusippe, for the roughness in the ancient\r\nmosaics would, of course, break up the great plain surfaces and make\r\nthem more interesting. But Salviati did Venice a service, nevertheless,\r\nin reviving the art. And there is, too, another virtue about mosaics,\r\nand that is that they will endure far longer than paintings. Had it not\r\nbeen for the foresight of Pope Urban, who between 1600 and 1700 had\r\nmany of the famous pictures of the Vatican copied in mosaic, these\r\nmasterpieces would have been lost to the world."\r\n\r\n"I have been told that the church in Ravenna has some fine mosaics, but\r\nI never have seen them," Giusippe ventured.\r\n\r\n"I have. They are beautiful, and I hope you may see them some time.\r\nThen there are others scattered through the various churches of Sicily\r\nand Rome; and there are also many beautiful inlays of mosaic decorating\r\nthe old churches and palaces of European cities. When we visit\r\nWestminster Abbey, Jean, I must show you the crude early mosaic work on\r\nthe tomb of Edward the Confessor. It is very curious, for it is made of\r\npieces of colored glass set in grooves of marble."\r\n\r\n"How much you are to see, se\xc3\xb1orita," observed Giusippe wistfully.\r\n\r\nMr. Cabot fixed his eyes attentively on the boy.\r\n\r\n"Should you, too, like to see all these wonders, Giusippe?" he asked\r\nhalf playfully and half in earnest.\r\n\r\nBut Giusippe, who did not catch the banter in his tone, answered\r\nseriously:\r\n\r\n"Should I? Ah, se\xc3\xb1or, it is not for me to envy or be unhappy about that\r\nwhich I may not have. Some day, perhaps, when I have made my fortune in\r\nyour country I can return to the old world and see its marvels. I must\r\nhave a little patience, that is all."\r\n\r\nThe mingling of sadness and longing in the reply touched Uncle Bob;\r\nJean and the young Venetian chattered on, but Mr. Cabot walked silently\r\nahead, deep in thought.\r\n\r\n"Did I understand you to say, Giusippe," he asked at last turning\r\nabruptly, "that you have no relatives in Venice?"\r\n\r\n"None in all the world with the exception of the uncle in America of\r\nwhom I told you, se\xc3\xb1or."\r\n\r\nAgain there was a pause.\r\n\r\n"Suppose I were to take you with us."\r\n\r\n"What, se\xc3\xb1or?"\r\n\r\n"Take you with us now, when we leave Venice."\r\n\r\n"I do not understand."\r\n\r\n"Suppose I asked you to go with us to France and England, and then\r\nacross to America."\r\n\r\n"But I have not enough money, se\xc3\xb1or."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t much, either," Mr. Cabot answered, smiling kindly into the\r\nboy\'s puzzled eyes. "Still, I think I could get together a sufficient\r\nsum to pay your way until you got to the United States and found work."\r\n\r\n"To go--to go with you now, do you mean, se\xc3\xb1or?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. We leave Venice next week for France. You see, I like you,\r\nGiusippe; we all do. And in addition to that you have done us a\r\nservice. But more than anything else I feel that, once started, you are\r\ncapable of making your way and doing well in life; all you need is a\r\nchance. I have perfect faith that if I took you to America you would\r\nmake good. It would cost very little more were you to join us, and no\r\ndoubt you could help in many little ways during the trip. Do you speak\r\nFrench at all?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, some; but more German. It is nothing. Many travelers come to\r\nVenice, and one must talk to them. Then, too, here it is not unusual to\r\nspeak several languages, because the countries lie near together, and\r\nthe people come and go from place to place. With you it is different; a\r\nmighty sea divides you from the rest of the world."\r\n\r\n"Despite all your excuses for us, Giusippe, it is quite true that we\r\nAmericans are as a rule pitiably ignorant about languages. Here is this\r\nboy, Jean, who knows not only his mother tongue but French, German and\r\nEnglish besides. Isn\'t that a rebuke to us, with our fine schools and\r\nour college educations? It makes me ashamed of myself. Do you, little\r\ngirl, try and do better than I have. Well, young man, what do you say\r\nto my proposition? Will you come with us to America?"\r\n\r\n"Se\xc3\xb1or! Oh, se\xc3\xb1or! How can I ever----"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, that settles it," interrupted Mr. Cabot, cutting him\r\nshort. "I will arrange everything. But there is just one condition to\r\nbe made, my youthful Venetian patriot. If by chance we see any of those\r\nold mirrors made by the early Frenchmen who stole your art from Murano\r\nyou are not to smash them. Remember!"\r\n\r\nGiusippe laughed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nGIUSIPPE ENCOUNTERS AN OLD FRIEND\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely a reality to Jean, to Hannah, or to Giusippe himself\r\nwhen Uncle Bob actually set forth for France with the young Venetian as\r\na member of the party. Yet every one was pleased: Hannah because she\r\nwould not now need her foreign dictionaries; Jean because it was jolly\r\nto have a companion her own age; and Giusippe because he felt that at\r\nlast he had friends who were to guide for him the future which had\r\nloomed so darkly and so vaguely before him. Not a full week of the trip\r\nto Paris had passed before Mr. Cabot declared that how he had\r\npreviously got on without that boy he did not understand. Giusippe had\r\nsuch a wonderful way of making himself useful; not only did he see what\r\nneeded to be done, but he was quick to do it.\r\n\r\n"His enthusiasm alone is worth the money I am paying for his railroad\r\nfares and hotel bills!" ejaculated Uncle Bob to Hannah.\r\n\r\nThere certainly never was such a boy to take in everything around him,\r\nand to remember what he saw. With mind alert for all that was to be\r\nlearned he tagged along at Mr. Cabot\'s heels drinking in and storing\r\naway every scrap of history and of beauty which came across his path.\r\nAnd in Paris he found much of both. The Invalides with the tomb of\r\nNapoleon; Notre Dame with its odd gargoyles; the Arc de Triomphe; the\r\nBois; and the Champs-Elysees shaded by pink horse-chestnut trees--all\r\nthese sights were new and marvelous to the Italian lad. But it was\r\nVersailles with its gardens that charmed him and Jean most.\r\n\r\nThe travelers arrived there on a Sunday, when the fountains were\r\nplaying, flowers blooming everywhere, and a gay crowd of sightseers\r\nthronging the walks. It was like fairy-land. The great Neptune fountain\r\nsent into the air a sheet of spray which was quickly caught up by the\r\nsunlight and transformed into a misty rainbow. Within the palace, amid\r\nold tapestries of battles and hunting scenes, and surrounded by\r\npaintings and statues, were the famous early French mirrors of which\r\nGiusippe had previously spoken.\r\n\r\nMr. Cabot pointed them out, half playfully, half seriously.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps on further consideration I will leave them," returned the boy,\r\nfalling in with the spirit of the elder man\'s mood. "They seem to fit\r\nthe spaces, and I doubt if even our Venetian mirrors could look better\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"I think it might be just as well," answered Mr. Cabot. "Besides, you\r\nmust remember that those mirrors were not the only sort of glass the\r\nFrench made. There were many enamel workers at Proven\xc3\xa7e as early as\r\n1520, and later much cast glass instead of that which is blown came\r\nfrom France. In fact, up to a hundred years ago the French held the\r\nplate glass monopoly. Then England took up glass-making and cut into\r\nthe French market--the same old story of stealing the trade, you see.\r\nIn addition to other varieties of glass-making some of the finest and\r\nmost interesting of the old stained glass was made by the French\r\npeople, and can now be seen in the church of St. Denis, just out of\r\nParis, and at Sainte Chapelle which is within the city itself.\r\nFortunately the glass at St. Denis escaped the fury of the French\r\nrevolutionists, as it might not have done had it not been at a little\r\ndistance from Paris. There is also glass of much the same sort at\r\nPoitiers, Bourges, and Rheims. Amiens, too, has wonderful glass\r\nwindows. I hope before we leave for home we shall have a peep at some\r\nif not all of these."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t much beautiful French glass now made at Nancy, Mr. Cabot?"\r\nGiusippe inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes, some of the finest comes from there."\r\n\r\n"But didn\'t any other people beside the Venetians and the French make\r\nglass, Uncle Bob?" asked Jean, much interested.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. Almost every European nation has tried its hand at\r\nglass-making. It is curious, too, to notice how each differs from the\r\nothers. The Bohemians, for instance, were famous glass-makers, and\r\ntheir work, which primarily imitated that of the Venetians, is known\r\nthe world over."\r\n\r\n"What sort of glass is it? Could I tell it if I should see it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, for one thing they make beautiful wine glasses and goblets,\r\nhaving stems of enclosed white and colored enamel tubes twisted\r\ntogether with transparent glass, which look as if they had delicate\r\nthreads of color running through them. Then the Bohemians and the\r\nAustrians make many great beakers or drinking glasses, steins, and\r\nbowls with decorative coats of arms upon them in gold or in colored\r\nenamel."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have seen things like that," Jean replied.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we have some of those ornamental goblets at home in the\r\ndining-room. They are very rich and handsome. Beside these varieties\r\nthe Bohemians have of late revived the making of old white opaque glass\r\nwith colored enamel figures on it. But engraved glass is one of the\r\nkinds for which Bohemia is chiefly celebrated. Even very skilful glass\r\nengravers can be had there for little money. They cut fine, delicate\r\ndesigns upon the glass with a lathe. Some of this is white, but much of\r\nit is of deep red or blue with the pattern engraved on it in white.\r\nSuch glass is made in two layers, the outer one being cut away so to\r\nleave the design upon the surface underneath."\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t it the Bohemians who invented cut glass?" Giusippe asked.\r\n\r\n"No. Sometimes people say so, but this is not true. The fact is that\r\nthere chanced to be a glass cutter so skilful that he was appointed\r\nlapidary to Rudolph the Second; he had a workshop at Prague, but though\r\nhe did some very wonderful glass cutting, which gained him much fame,\r\nhe did not invent the art. It was, by the way, one of his workmen who\r\nlater migrated to Nuremburg and carried the secret of glass-cutting to\r\nGermany."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it queer how one country learned of another?" reflected Jean.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and it is especially interesting when we see how hard each tried\r\nnot to teach his neighbor anything. There always was somebody, just as\r\nthere always is now, who could not keep still and went and told," Mr.\r\nCabot said. "And while we are speaking of the different kinds of glass\r\nwe must not forget to mention the dark red ruby glass perfected in 1680\r\nby Kunckel, the director of the Potsdam glass works, for it is a very\r\ningenious invention. The deep color is obtained by putting a thin layer\r\nof gold between the white glass and the coating of red."\r\n\r\n"What else did the Germans make?" queried Giusippe.\r\n\r\n"Well, the Germans, like the other nations, turned out glass which was\r\nsuggestive of their people. And that, by the by, is a fact you must\r\nnotice when seeing the work of so many different countries. Observe how\r\nthe art of each reflects the characteristics of those who made it.\r\nItaly gave us fragile, dainty glass famous for its airy beauty and\r\ndelicacy; Germany, on the other hand, fashions a far more massive,\r\nrough, and heavier product--large flasks, steins and goblets, some of\r\nwhich are even clumsy; all are substantial and useful, however, and\r\nhave the big cordial spirit of fellowship so characteristic of the\r\nGerman people. These glasses are decorated in large flat designs less\r\nchoice, perhaps, than are the Bohemian. The shape of the German goblets\r\nand drinking glasses differs, too, from those made in Italy. They are\r\nless graceful, less dainty. Instead you will find throughout Germany\r\ntall cylindrical shafts, tankards, and steins adorned with massive\r\neagles or colored coats of arms; often, moreover, both the Bohemians\r\nand the Germans use pictorial designs showing processions of soldiers,\r\nbattle scenes, or cavalry charges such as would appeal to nations whose\r\nmilitary life has long been one of the leading interests of their\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Mr. Cabot," inquired Giusippe eagerly, "did you ever see one\r\nof the German puzzle cups?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, several of them. In the British Museum there are several of the\r\nwindmill variety."\r\n\r\n"What is a puzzle cup, Uncle Bob?" demanded Jean.\r\n\r\n"Why, a puzzle or wager cup, as they are sometimes called, was an\r\ningenious invention of the Germans during their early days of\r\nglass-making. The kind I speak of is a large inverted goblet which has\r\non top a small silver windmill. The wager was to set the fans\r\nrevolving, turn the glass right side up, and then fill and drain it\r\nbefore the mill stopped turning. Such wagers were very popular in those\r\nolden days and are interesting as relics of a medi\xc3\xa6val and far-away\r\nperiod in history."\r\n\r\nSo intently had Mr. Cabot and the others been talking that they had\r\nstopped in the center of the room and it was while they were standing\r\nthere that a party of tourists entered from the hallway. Foremost among\r\nthem was an American girl who carried in her hand a much worn Baedeker.\r\nAs her eye swept over the tapestries covering the walls her glance fell\r\nupon Giusippe.\r\n\r\nInstantly she started and with parted lips stepped forward; then she\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n"It cannot be!" Mr. Cabot heard her murmur.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, however, Giusippe had seen her.\r\n\r\n"The beautiful se\xc3\xb1orita!" he cried. "My lady of Venice!"\r\n\r\nHe was beside her in an instant.\r\n\r\n"Giusippe! Giusippe!" exclaimed the girl. "Can it really be you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, se\xc3\xb1orita! It is I. Ah, that I should see you again! What a\r\njoy it is. Surely four or five years must have passed since first you\r\ncame to paint in Venice."\r\n\r\n"Fully that, my little Giusippe. It is five years this June. You have a\r\ngood memory."\r\n\r\n"How could I forget you, se\xc3\xb1orita; and the pictures, and your kindness!\r\nBut I have left Venice, you see. Yes. Even now I am on my way to\r\nAmerica."\r\n\r\n"To America? Oh, Giusippe, Giusippe! And that is why you have discarded\r\nyour faded blouse, and the red tie which you wore knotted round your\r\nthroat. Alas! I am almost sorry. And yet you look very nice," she added\r\nkindly. "But to leave Venice!"\r\n\r\n"It is best," Giusippe explained gently. "I have my way to make, and I\r\ncan do it better in your country, my se\xc3\xb1orita."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps. Still, I am sorry to have you leave your home. It is like\r\ntaking sea shells away from the sands of the shore."\r\n\r\n"And yet you would want me to be a man and succeed in life. Think how\r\nyou yourself worked for success."\r\n\r\n"I know. And it was you who brought it to me, Giusippe. The portrait I\r\npainted of you was exhibited in America and when I later sold it to an\r\nart dealer there it brought me a little fortune; but the fame it\r\nbrought was best of all." The girl put her hand softly on the lad\'s\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"Oh, se\xc3\xb1orita, how glad I am!"\r\n\r\n"I had a feeling that you would bring me luck the morning when I first\r\nsaw you in the square near St. Mark\'s. Do you remember? And how you\r\nstood watching me paint? Do you recall how we got to talking and how I\r\nasked if I might do the portrait of you? You laughed when I suggested\r\nit! And then you came to the hotel evenings when you were free, and I\r\nsketched in the picture. It seems but yesterday. In the meantime you\r\nentertained me by telling me of Venice and its history. What a little\r\nfellow you were to know so much!" The girl smiled down at him. "And now\r\nlet me hear of yourself. What of your parents?"\r\n\r\n"Alas, se\xc3\xb1orita, they have died. I am now quite alone in the world. It\r\nis for that that I felt I must leave Venice. It is sad to be alone,\r\nse\xc3\xb1orita."\r\n\r\n"So it is, Giusippe. No one knows that better than I." Impulsively she\r\nslipped a hand into the small Venetian\'s. "But I must not take you from\r\nyour friends. See, we have kept them waiting a long time."\r\n\r\n"I want you to meet them, se\xc3\xb1orita. They are from your country, and\r\nthey have been kind to me."\r\n\r\n"Then surely I must meet them."\r\n\r\nWith a shy gesture the boy led her forward.\r\n\r\n"Miss Cartright is from New York, Mr. Cabot," said Giusippe simply.\r\n"Long ago when I was a little lad I knew her in Venice, and she was\r\ngood to me and to my parents."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I KNEW HER IN VENICE"]\r\n\r\n"It was five years ago," added Miss Cartright. "I went there to paint."\r\n\r\n"And little Giusippe, perhaps, made your stay as delightful as he has\r\nmade ours," Mr. Cabot said.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I was all by myself, and knew no one in Venice. Furthermore, I\r\nspoke only a word or two of Italian. Giusippe was a great comfort. He\r\nkept me from being lonesome."\r\n\r\n"And you are now staying in Paris?" questioned Mr. Cabot.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have been here with friends studying for nearly a year; but I\r\nam soon to return home. And now, before I leave you, I want to hear all\r\nabout Giusippe\'s plans. What is he to do?"\r\n\r\nLittle by little the story was told. Mr. Cabot began it and continued\r\nit until Giusippe, who thought him too modest, finished the tale.\r\n\r\n"You see, se\xc3\xb1orita, Mr. Cabot, Miss Jean, and good Hannah will not\r\nthemselves tell you how kind they have been, so I myself must tell it,"\r\nsaid the boy. "And now I go with them to find a position in America\r\nthat by hard work I may some time be able to repay them for their\r\ngoodness to me."\r\n\r\nMiss Cartright nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nAt last she said:\r\n\r\n"If you should come to New York I want to see you, Giusippe. There\r\nmight be something I could do to help you. Anyway, I should want to\r\nhave a glimpse of you. And if you do not come and Mr. Cabot does,\r\nperhaps, since he knows how fond of you I am and how much I am\r\ninterested in your welfare, he will come and tell me how you are\r\ngetting on."\r\n\r\nShe drew from her purse a card which she handed to the lad.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I\'d better take it, Giusippe," Mr. Cabot said in a low tone.\r\n"It might get lost."\r\n\r\nThen there was a confusion of farewells, and the girl rejoined her\r\nfriends, who had gone through into the next room.\r\n\r\nIt was not until she was well out of ear-shot that any one spoke. Then\r\nJean, who had been silent throughout the entire interview, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Oh, isn\'t she beautiful! Isn\'t she the very loveliest lady you ever\r\nsaw, Giusippe?"\r\n\r\nAnd Giusippe, answering in voluble English mixed with Italian, extolled\r\nnot only the fairness but the goodness of his goddess.\r\n\r\nEven Hannah agreed that the American girl was charming, but regretted\r\nthat she had not come from Boston instead of New York.\r\n\r\nUncle Bob alone was silent. Turning the white card in his fingers he\r\nstood absently looking at the door through which Miss Ethel Cartright\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nUNCLE BOB AS STORY TELLER\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Bob and his party remained in France several weeks, and during\r\nthat time visited the old French cathedrals with their interesting\r\nwindows; and saw in the Louvre much glass of early French make as well\r\nas many beautiful Venetian mirrors with all sorts of unique histories.\r\nOne mirror was that famous seventeenth century possession of Marie de\r\nMedici, a looking-glass set in a frame which represented a fortune of\r\nover thirty thousand dollars. This mirror was of rock crystal combined\r\nwith cut and polished agates, and around it was a network of enameled\r\ngold. Outside this inner frame was a larger one formed entirely of\r\nprecious stones. Three large emeralds as well as smaller diamonds and\r\nrubies adorned it.\r\n\r\n"Probably," said Mr. Cabot, "this is but one of many such examples of\r\nancient luxury. Unfortunately, however, most of these extravagant\r\naffairs have been melted up by avaricious monarchs who coveted the gems\r\nand gold. Such ornate mirrors are a relic of the Renaissance when each\r\nobject made was considered an art work on which every means of\r\nenrichment was lavished. I do not know that I think it any handsomer\r\nthan are the simpler mirrors with their Venetian frames of exquisitely\r\ncarved wood, of which there are many fine specimens in the Louvre."\r\n\r\n"Is the mirror that was given by the Republic of Venice to Henry the\r\nThird in the Louvre?" asked Giusippe.\r\n\r\n"No, that is in the Cluny Museum. You have heard of it, then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; often in Venice. I have seen pictures of it, too," Giusippe\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"We must see it before we leave France," declared Mr. Cabot. "It was,\r\nas you already know, presented to Henry the Third on his return from\r\nPoland. It is set in a wonderfully designed frame of colored and white\r\nbeveled glass, and the decoration is of alternating fleur-de-lis and\r\npalm leaves, which are fastened to the frame by a series of screws. It\r\nis quite a different sort of mirror from that of Marie de Medici."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see it," Jean said.\r\n\r\n"You certainly shall."\r\n\r\nHow rich France was in beautiful things! One never could see them all.\r\n\r\nOne of the sights that especially interested Jean and Hannah was the\r\nimitation gems displayed in the Paris jewelry shops. These exquisite\r\nstones, Uncle Bob told them, were made in laboratories by workmen so\r\nskilful that only an expert could distinguish the manufactured gems\r\nfrom the real, the stones conforming to almost every test applied to\r\ngenuine jewels. They were not manufactured, however, for the purpose of\r\ndeceiving people, but rather to be sold to those who either could not\r\nafford valuable stones or did not wish the care of them. The imitation\r\npearls were especially fine, and by no means cheap either, as Hannah\r\nsoon found out when she attempted to purchase a small string.\r\n\r\nBut many as were the wonderful sights in France, the continent had soon\r\nto be left behind, and almost before the travelers realized it the\r\nChannel had been crossed and they stood upon English soil. As Uncle\r\nBob\'s time was limited they went direct to London, and when once there\r\none of the first things that Giusippe wished to see were the mosaics in\r\nSt. Paul\'s Cathedral of which he had heard so much. So they set out. On\r\nreaching the church Giusippe regarded it with awe. How unlike it was to\r\nhis well loved St. Mark\'s. And yet how beautiful!\r\n\r\n"These mosaics, like the ones we shall see at the Houses of Parliament,\r\nwere not first made and then put up on the walls as were those such as\r\nSalviati and other Venetians shipped from Venice," explained Mr. Cabot.\r\n"No, these were made directly upon the walls, the pieces of glass being\r\npressed into prepared areas of cement spread thickly upon the brickwork\r\nof the building. The designs are simple, large and effective figures\r\nbeing preferred to smaller and more intricate patterns. Millions of\r\npieces have been used to make the pictures, and if you will notice\r\ncarefully you will see that they have the rough surface which catches\r\nthe light as do all the early Venetian mosaics."\r\n\r\nGiusippe nodded.\r\n\r\n"There must also be some fine old glass windows in London," he\r\nspeculated. "Aren\'t there, Mr. Cabot?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, some varieties that you did not have in Venice, too," declared\r\nUncle Bob. "You see other people did invent something, Giusippe. Here\r\nin England in some of the older houses there are windows made of tiny\r\npieces of white glass leaded together; people were not able at that\r\ntime to get large sheets of glass such as we now use, and I am not sure\r\nthat these windows made of small leaded panes were not prettier. Then\r\nyou will find other windows made from what we call bull\'s eye glass.\r\nThese bull\'s eyes were the centers or waste from large discs of crown\r\nglass after all the big pieces possible had been cut away. As most\r\nglass comes now in sheets crown glass is little made, and therefore we\r\nfind bull\'s eyes rare unless manufactured expressly to imitate the\r\nantique roundels."\r\n\r\n"Of course there is lots of old stained glass in England, isn\'t there,\r\nUncle Bob?" Jean ventured.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. I am sorry to say, however, that much of it has been\r\ndestroyed before the public realized its value. At Salisbury Cathedral,\r\nfor instance, some of the fine old glass was taken down and beaten to\r\npieces in order that the lead might be used. At Oxford rare Gothic\r\nwindows were removed and broken up to give room for the more modern\r\nwork of the Renaissance. But you will still find at Canterbury and in\r\nmany other of the English churches stained glass which has escaped\r\ndestruction and come down to us through hundreds of years. And speaking\r\nof how such things have been preserved I must tell you the wonderful\r\nstory of the east window in St. Margaret\'s Chapel at Westminster."\r\n\r\n"Oh, do tell us!" begged Jean. "I love stories."\r\n\r\n"This story is almost like a fairy tale, when one considers that it is\r\nthe history of such a fragile thing as a glass window," Mr. Cabot\r\nbegan. "This window of which I am telling you was Flemish in design,\r\nand is said to have been ordered by Ferdinand and Isabella when their\r\ndaughter Catherine was engaged to Arthur, the Prince of Wales. But for\r\nsome reason it was not delivered, and a Dutch magistrate later decided\r\nto present it to King Henry the Seventh. Unfortunately the king died\r\nbefore the gift arrived and it came into the hands of the Abbot of\r\nWaltham. Now these were very troublous times for a stained glass window\r\nto be traveling about the land; Cromwell was in power and his followers\r\nbelieved it right to destroy everything which existed merely because of\r\nits beauty. So the old abbot was afraid his treasure would be wrecked,\r\nand to insure its safety he buried it."\r\n\r\n"How funny!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"What happened then?"\r\n\r\n"After the Restoration one of the loyal generals of the Crown had the\r\nwindow dug up and placed in a chapel on his estate. But the house\r\nchanged hands and as its new owner did not like the window he offered\r\nit to Wadham College. The college authorities, alas, did not care for\r\nit, so it remained cased up for many years. Then by and by along came\r\nan Englishman who had the courage to buy it and have it set up in his\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"Was that the end of it?" queried Giusippe.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed. This person died, and his son took down the stained glass\r\nheirloom and in 1758 sold it to a committee which was at that time busy\r\ndecorating St. Margaret\'s Chapel. Here at last it was set up and here\r\none cannot but hope it will remain. Certainly it has earned a long\r\nrest."\r\n\r\n"Shouldn\'t you think it would have been broken in all that time?"\r\nejaculated Jean.\r\n\r\n"One would certainly have thought so," Uncle Bob agreed. "It seemed to\r\npossess a charmed life. Most of that early glass was made by Flemish\r\nrefugees who had fled to England to escape religious persecution. Some\r\nwas designed for English monasteries. Houses, you know, did not have\r\nglass windows at that time but depended for protection upon oiled paper\r\nand skins. Glass was considered a luxury, and it was many, many years\r\nbefore window glass or table glass was in use. Rich English families\r\nbought glass dishes from galleys which, as Giusippe has told us, came\r\nladen from Venice. Sometimes this Venetian glass was mounted in gold or\r\nsilver. There was, it is true, a little glass of English make, but no\r\none thought it worth using; in fact when the stained glass windows were\r\nput into Beauchamp Chapel at Warwick it was expressly stated that no\r\nEnglish glass was to be used."\r\n\r\n"How did glass ever come to be made here, then?" inquired Jean.\r\n\r\n"Well, in time more Flemish Protestants fled to England and began\r\nmaking stained glass at London, Stourbridge, and Newcastle-on-Tyne. In\r\n1589 there were fifteen glass-houses in England. Then, because so much\r\nwood had been used in the iron foundries, the supply became exhausted\r\nand sea or pit coal had to be used instead. People were forced to try,\r\nin consequence, a different kind of melting pot for their glass and a\r\nnew mixture of material; in this way they stumbled upon a heavy,\r\nbrilliant, white crystal metal which the French called \'the most\r\nbeautiful glassy substance known.\' It was the pure white flint, or\r\ncrystal glass, for which England has since become famous. Immediately\r\nit began to be used for all sorts of things. In 1637 the Duke of\r\nBuckingham had flint glass windows for his coach, and he had some\r\nVenetian workmen make mirrors out of it. So it went. A great many more\r\nmirrors were made, great pier glasses with beveled edges. It is said\r\nthat some of those very mirrors are even now at Hampton Court. In the\r\ncourse of time the English became more and more skilful at\r\nglass-making, and when Queen Victoria came to the throne they were\r\nmanufacturing enormous cut glass ornaments and bowls, and decorating\r\ntheir palaces and theaters with glass chandeliers which had myriads of\r\nheavy, sparkling prisms dangling from them. You will remember that in\r\nVenice you saw some glass chandeliers; and you may recall how\r\ndelicately fashioned they were and how their twisted branches were\r\ncovered with glass flowers in the center of which candles could be set.\r\nBut the English chandeliers were far more massive affairs than those.\r\nAnd no sooner did English workmen find what they could do with this new\r\nmaterial than they went mad over glass-making. Why, in 1851 they\r\nactually built for the first International Exhibit a Crystal Palace\r\nwith a big glass fountain in it. Its builder was James Paxton, and he\r\nwas knighted for doing it."\r\n\r\n"I should think he deserved to be!" Jean said. "Who ever would have\r\nthought of making a palace of glass!"\r\n\r\n"This one attracted much attention, I assure you," said Uncle Bob.\r\n"Later it was reconstructed at Sydenham and to this day there it\r\nstands. England now makes the finest crystal glass of any country in\r\nthe world; but to-morrow I intend to take you to the British Museum and\r\nshow you that in spite of all that European nations have done there\r\nwere other very skilful glass-makers in the world before any of them\r\nmade glass at all."\r\n\r\n"Before the time of the Greeks and Romans--before the people who made\r\nthe Naples Vase?" Jean asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, centuries before."\r\n\r\n"Who were they?" demanded both Jean and Giusippe in the same breath.\r\n\r\n"The Egyptians first; and after them the Phoenicians and Syrians. All\r\nthese peoples lived where they could easily get plenty of the fine\r\nwhite sand necessary for glass-making. In some of the old tombs glass\r\nbeads, cups, drinking-vessels, and curiously shaped vials have been\r\nfound, many of them very beautiful in color. Some of this color is due\r\nto the action of the soil and the atmosphere, for science tells us that\r\nafter glass has been buried in the earth many centuries and is then\r\nexposed to the air it begins to decay and its color often changes. We\r\nhave in our museums many pieces of ancient glass which have changed\r\ncolor in this way and have become far more beautiful than they\r\noriginally were. How these races that lived in the remote ages found\r\nout how to make glass no one knows; but certain it is that the\r\nEgyptians could fashion imitation gems, crude mosaics and various glass\r\nvessels. Later the Phoenicians improved the art and afterward, as you\r\nhave seen, the Greeks and Romans took it up. There is a strange tale of\r\nhow, during the reign of Tiberius, a glass-maker discovered how to make\r\na kind of glass which would not break. It was a sort of malleable\r\nglass."\r\n\r\n"Oh, tell us about it, please, Uncle Bob."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, if you would like to hear. This glass-maker made a cup for\r\nthe Emperor and tried a long time to get an audience at which to\r\npresent his new invention. Then at last the chance came, and thinking\r\nto make himself famous the artisan contrived, as he passed the flagon\r\nto his sovereign, to drop it on the marble floor. Of course every one\r\nthought the glass was broken, and that is precisely what the\r\nglass-maker wanted them to think. He picked it up, smoothed out with\r\nhis hammer the dent made in its side, and passed it once more expecting\r\nto receive praise for his wonderful deed. Tiberius eyed him silently.\r\nThen he asked; \'Does any one else know how to make glass like this?\'\r\n\r\n"\'No one,\' answered the glass-maker.\r\n\r\n"\'Off with his head at once!\' cried the enraged monarch. \'If glass\r\ndishes and flasks do not break they will soon become as valuable as my\r\ngold and silver ones!\'\r\n\r\n"Despite his protests the poor glass-maker was dragged off and\r\nbeheaded. The rulers of those days were not very fair-minded, you see."\r\n\r\nWith so many interesting stories, and so many things to see, you may be\r\nsure that neither Jean nor Giusippe found sightseeing dull. And the\r\nnext day Uncle Bob was as good as his word, and took the young people\r\nto the British Museum, where he showed them some of the old Egyptian\r\nand Gr\xc3\xa6co-Syrian glass. There were little vases, cups, and flasks of\r\nwonderful iridescent color, as well as many glass beads that had been\r\nfound upon Egyptian mummies.\r\n\r\n"Now, Uncle Bob," Jean said, after they had looked at these strange old\r\nbits of glass for some time, "you must take us to see the Portland\r\nVase. You promised you would, you know."\r\n\r\n"Sure enough; so I did. I should have forgotten it, too, had you not\r\nmentioned it."\r\n\r\nAccordingly they hunted up the Gold Room where the vase stood.\r\n\r\nJean was very proud that she was able to point it out before she had\r\nbeen told which one it was.\r\n\r\n"You see," explained she shyly, "it is so much like the Naples Vase\r\nthat I recognized it right off."\r\n\r\nIt was indeed of the same dark blue transparent glass, and had on it\r\nthe same sort of delicate white cameo figures.\r\n\r\n"This vase," Mr. Cabot said, "was found about the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century enclosed in a marble sarcophagus in an underground\r\nchamber which was located two and a half miles out of Rome. It was\r\ntaken to the Barbarini Palace, but later the princess of that noble\r\nfamily, wishing to raise money, sold it to Sir William Hamilton, who\r\nchanced to be at that time the English ambassador to Naples. From him\r\nit passed to the Duchess of Portland, and at her death was sold at\r\nauction to the new Duke of Portland. That is the way it got its name.\r\nNow the Duke, desirous of putting his precious purchase in a safe\r\nplace, and also wishing to allow others to enjoy it, lent it to the\r\nBritish Museum. Imagine his horror and that of the Museum authorities\r\nwhen in 1845 a lunatic named Lloyd, who saw it, viciously smashed it to\r\npieces."\r\n\r\nHis hearers gasped.\r\n\r\n"To see it you would not dream that it had ever been broken, would you?\r\nYes, it has been so carefully mended that no one could tell the\r\ndifference. It was this vase which the English potter, Wedgwood,\r\ncoveted so intensely that he bid a thousand pounds for it; the Duke of\r\nPortland outbid him by just twenty-nine pounds. He was, however, a\r\ngenerous man, and when at last the vase was his he allowed Wedgwood to\r\ncopy it. This took a year\'s time, and even then the copy was far less\r\nbeautiful than was the original. Many copies of it have been made\r\nsince, but never has any one succeeded in making anything to equal the\r\nvase itself. You will see copies of it in almost all our American\r\nmuseums."\r\n\r\n"I mean to see when I get home if there is a copy of it in Boston,"\r\nJean remarked.\r\n\r\n"You will find one at the Art Museum. And now while we are here there\r\nis still that other famous vase which I mentioned once before and which\r\nI should like to have you see. It is not, perhaps, as fine as the\r\nNaples or the Portland, but it is nevertheless one celebrated the world\r\nover. Like the Naples Vase it came from Pompeii, and like the Portland\r\nVase it has been skilfully mended. It is called the Auldjo Vase."\r\n\r\nUncle Bob was not long in finding where this treasure stood. It was\r\nsmall--not more than nine inches in height, and like the other two was\r\nof the familiar blue transparent glass with a white cameo design cut\r\nupon it. Instead of having a Grecian decoration, however, the pattern\r\nwas of vines, leaves, and clusters of grapes.\r\n\r\n"The Portland Vase, as I have already told you, was perfect when it was\r\nunearthed," Mr. Cabot said. "And the Naples Vase you will remember was\r\nalso whole except that its base, or foot, which was probably of gold,\r\nwas missing. But the Auldjo Vase was in pieces, and it was only a\r\nsingle one of these fragments that was bequeathed to the British Museum\r\nby Miss Auldjo. Now when the Museum committee saw this single piece\r\nnothing would do but they must have the others. They therefore bought\r\nthe rest, had the vase mended, and set it up here where people can see\r\nit. It cost a great deal of money to purchase it."\r\n\r\n"I think it is splendid of museums and of rich people to buy such\r\nthings and put them where every one can look at them!" exclaimed Jean.\r\n"None of us could afford to and if those who owned them just kept them\r\nin their own houses we should never see them at all."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Remember that, too, in this day when there are so many persons\r\nwho begrudge the rich their fortunes. Remember if there were not\r\nindividuals in the world who possessed fortunes the poor would have far\r\nless opportunity to see art treasures of every sort. And that is one\r\nway in which those who are rich and generous can serve their country.\r\nThere are many different methods of being a good citizen, you see."\r\n\r\nMr. Cabot took out his watch and glanced at it thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"I think we shall have time to see just one thing more, and then we\r\nmust go back to the hotel. We have examined all kinds of glass\r\nobjects--so many, in fact, that it would seem as if there was no other\r\npurpose for which glass could be used. And yet I can show you something\r\nof which, I will wager, you have not thought."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" questioned the two young people breathlessly.\r\n\r\nFull of curiosity, Uncle Bob led them through several corridors until\r\nhe came to a large room that they had not visited. He conducted them to\r\nits farther end and paused before a large sand glass.\r\n\r\n"Before the days of clocks and watches," he began, "such glasses as\r\nthese were much in use for telling the time. Throughout the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries they had them in almost all the churches,\r\nthat the officiating clergyman might be able to measure the length of\r\nhis sermon."\r\n\r\nJean laughed.\r\n\r\n"I wish they had them now," she declared mischievously.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes I do," smiled Uncle Bob. "It is said the glasses were\r\noriginally invented in Egypt. Wherever they came from, they certainly\r\nwere a great convenience to those who had no other means of telling the\r\ntime. Charlemagne, I have read, had a sand glass so large that it\r\nneeded to be turned only once in twelve hours. Fancy how large it must\r\nhave been. At the South Kensington Museum is a set of four large sand\r\nglasses evidently made to go together. Of course you have seen, even in\r\nour day, hour, quarter-hour, and minute glasses."\r\n\r\n"I used to practice by an hour glass," Jean replied quickly. "At least\r\nit was a quarter-of-an-hour glass, and I had to turn it four times."\r\n\r\n"It would be strange not to have clocks and watches, wouldn\'t it?"\r\nreflected Giusippe as they walked back to the hotel.\r\n\r\n"I guess it would!" Hannah returned emphatically. "The meals would\r\nnever be on time."\r\n\r\n"One advantage in that, my good Hannah, would be that nobody would ever\r\nbe scolded because he was late," retorted Mr. Cabot humorously.\r\n\r\nThe three weeks allotted for the London visit passed only too quickly,\r\nand surprisingly soon came the day when the travelers found themselves\r\naboard ship and homeward bound.\r\n\r\nPerhaps after all they were not altogether sorry, for despite the\r\nmarvels of the old world there is no place like home. Hannah was eager\r\nto open the Boston house and air it; Jean rejoiced that each throb of\r\nthe engine brought her nearer to her beloved doggie; Uncle Bob\'s\r\nfingers itched to be setting in place the Italian marbles he had\r\nordered for the new house; and Giusippe waited almost with bated breath\r\nfor his first sight of America, the country of his dreams.\r\n\r\nBut a great surprise was in store for every one of these persons as the\r\nmighty steamer left her moorings and put out of Liverpool harbor.\r\n\r\nAcross the deck came a vision, an apparition so unexpected that Jean\r\nand Giusippe cried out, and even Uncle Bob muttered to himself\r\nsomething which nobody could hear. The figure was that of a girl--a\r\ngirl with wind-tossed hair who, with head thrown back, stopped a moment\r\nand looked full into the sunset.\r\n\r\nIt was Miss Ethel Cartright of New York, Giusippe\'s beautiful lady of\r\nVenice!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nAMERICA ONCE MORE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voyage from Liverpool to Boston was thoroughly interesting to\r\nGiusippe. In the first place there was the wonder of the great blue\r\nsea--a sea so vast that the Italian boy, who had never before ventured\r\nbeyond the canals of the Adriatic, was bewildered when day after day\r\nthe giant ship plowed onward and still, despite her speed, failed to\r\nreach the land. Sunlight flooded the water, twilight settled into\r\ndarkness, and yet on every hand tossed that mighty expanse of waves.\r\nWould a haven ever be reached, the lad asked himself; and how, amid\r\nthat pathless ocean, could the captain be so sure that eventually he\r\nwould make the port for which he was aiming? It was all wonderful.\r\n\r\nFortunately the crossing was a smooth one, and accordingly every moment\r\nof the voyage was a delight. What happy days our travelers passed\r\ntogether! Miss Cartright was the jolliest of companions. She dressed\r\ndolls for Jean--dressed them in such gowns as never were seen, dainty\r\nFrench little frocks which converted the plainest china creature into a\r\nwee Parisian; she read aloud; she told stories; she played games.\r\nHannah surrendered unconditionally when, one morning after they had\r\nbeen comparing notes on housekeeping, the fact leaked out that Miss\r\nCartright\'s mother had been a New Englander. That was enough!\r\n\r\n"She has had the proper sort of bringing up," remarked Hannah, with a\r\nsigh of satisfaction. "She knows exactly how to pack away blankets and\r\nhow to clean house as it should be done. She is a very unusual young\r\nwoman!"\r\n\r\nComing from Hannah such praise was phenomenal.\r\n\r\nMr. Cabot seemed to think, too, that Miss Cartright possessed many\r\nvirtues.\r\n\r\nAt any rate he enjoyed talking with her, and every evening when the\r\nfull moon touched with iridescent beauty the wide, pulsing sea he would\r\ntuck the girl into her steamer chair and the two would stay up on deck\r\nuntil the clear golden ball of light had climbed high into the heaven.\r\n\r\nSo passed the voyage.\r\n\r\nThen as America came nearer Giusippe witnessed all the strange sights\r\nthat heralded the approach to the new continent; he saw the lights\r\ndotting the coast; he watched steamers which were outward bound for the\r\nold world he had left behind; he strained his eyes to catch, through a\r\ntelescope, the murky outlines of the land.\r\n\r\n"Here is still another use to which glass is put, Giusippe," said Mr.\r\nCabot indicating with a gesture the red flash-light of a beacon far\r\nagainst the horizon. "Without the powerful reflectors, lenses, and\r\nprisms which are in use in our lighthouses many a vessel would be\r\nwrecked. For not only must a lighthouse have a strong light; it must\r\nalso have a means of throwing that light out, and thereby increasing\r\nits effectiveness. Scientists have discovered just how to arrange\r\nprisms, lenses, and reflectors so the light will travel to the farthest\r\npossible distance. At Navasink, on the highlands south of New York\r\nharbor, stands the most powerful coast light in the United States. It\r\nequals about sixty million candle-power, and its beam can be seen\r\nseventy nautical miles away. The carrying of the light to such a\r\ntremendous distance is due to the strong reflectors employed in\r\nconjunction with the light itself. The largest lens, however, under\r\ncontrol of the United States is on the headlands of the Hawaiian\r\nIslands. This is eight and three-quarters feet in diameter and is made\r\nfrom the most carefully polished glass. And by the way, among other\r\nuses that science makes of glass are telescopes, microscopes, and\r\nfield-glasses, which are all constructed from flawlessly ground lenses.\r\nOften it takes a whole year, and sometimes even longer, to polish a\r\nlarge telescope lens. Without this magnifying agency we should have no\r\nastronomy, and fewer scientific discoveries than we now have. The\r\nglasses people wear all have to be ground and polished in much the same\r\nfashion; opera glasses, magic lanterns, and every contrivance for\r\nbringing distant objects nearer or making them larger are dependent for\r\ntheir power upon glass lenses."\r\n\r\n"Even when making glass I never dreamed it could be used for so many\r\ndifferent purposes," answered Giusippe.\r\n\r\n"I wish we had counted up, as we went along, how many things it is used\r\nfor," Jean put in.\r\n\r\n"We might have done so, only I am afraid you would have become very\r\ntired had we attempted it," laughed Uncle Bob. "In addition to optical\r\nglass there are still other branches of science that could not go on\r\nwithout glass in its various forms. Take, for instance, electricity. It\r\nwould not be safe to employ this strange force without the protection\r\nof glass barriers to hedge in its dangerous current. Glass, as you\r\nprobably know, is a non-conductor of electricity, and whenever we wish\r\nto confine its power and prevent it from doing harm we place a layer of\r\nglass between it and the thing to be protected. The glass checks the\r\nprogress of the current. In all chemical laboratories, too, no end of\r\nglass test-tubes, thermometers, and crucibles are in demand for\r\nfurthering research work. Science would be greatly hampered in its\r\nusefulness had it not recourse to glass in its manifold forms."\r\n\r\n"What a wonderful material it is!" ejaculated Jean. "I never shall see\r\nanything made of glass again without thinking of all it does for us."\r\n\r\n"Be grateful, too, Jean, to the men who have discovered how to use it,"\r\nreplied Mr. Cabot gravely. "Certainly our mariners many a time owe\r\ntheir safety to just such warning beacons as the one ahead. We must ask\r\nthe captain what light that is. Just think--to-morrow morning we shall\r\nwake up in Boston harbor and be at home again."\r\n\r\nA hush fell on the party.\r\n\r\n"I shall be dreadfully sorry to have Miss Cartright leave us and go to\r\nNew York; sha\'n\'t you, Uncle Bob?" said Jean at last, slipping her hand\r\ninto that of the older woman who stood beside her. "Wouldn\'t it be\r\nnice, Miss Cartright, if you lived in Boston? Then I\'d see you all the\r\ntime--at least I would when I wasn\'t in Pittsburgh, and then Uncle Bob\r\ncould see you, and that would be almost as good."\r\n\r\n"Almost," echoed Uncle Bob.\r\n\r\n"But you are coming to New York to see me some time, Jean dear," the\r\ngirl said with her eyes far on the horizon. "You know your uncle has\r\npromised that when you go to Pittsburgh both you and Giusippe are to\r\nstop and visit me for a few days."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have not forgotten; it will be lovely, too," replied Jean.\r\n"Still that is not like having you live where you can dress dolls all\r\nthe time. Why don\'t you move to Boston? I am sure you would like it. We\r\nhave the loveliest squirrels on the Common!"\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed.\r\n\r\n"I have been trying to tell Miss Cartright what a very nice place\r\nBoston is to live in," added Mr. Cabot softly.\r\n\r\n"Well, we all will keep on telling her, and then maybe she\'ll be\r\nconvinced," Jean declared.\r\n\r\nSo they parted for the night.\r\n\r\nWith the morning came the bustle and confusion of landing. Much of\r\nUncle Bob\'s time was taken up with the inspection of trunks, and with\r\nhelping Giusippe sign papers and answer the questions necessary for his\r\nadmission to the United States. Then came the parting. They bade a\r\nhurried good-bye to Miss Cartright, whom Uncle Bob was to put aboard\r\nthe New York train, and into a cab bundled Hannah, Giusippe, and Jean,\r\nin which equipage, almost smothered in luggage, they were rolled off to\r\nBeacon Hill.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed Giusippe\'s interest in these first glimpses of the\r\nnew country to which he had come. For the next few weeks he went about\r\nas if in a trance, struggling to adjust himself to life in an American\r\ncity. How different it was from his beloved Venice! How sharp the\r\nSeptember days with their early frost! How he missed the golden warmth\r\nof the sunny Adriatic and the familiar sights of home! During his\r\njourney through France and England the constant change of travel had\r\ncarried with it sufficient excitement to keep him from being homesick;\r\nbut now that he was settled for a time in Boston he got his first taste\r\nof what life in the United States was to be like. Not that he was\r\ndisappointed; it was only that he felt such a stranger to all about\r\nhim. The automobiles, subways, elevated roads, all confused his brain,\r\nand the dusty streets made his throat smart with dryness.\r\n\r\nDaily, however, he became more and more accustomed to his surroundings,\r\nand when at last he ventured out alone and discovered that he could\r\nfind his way back again his courage rose. Then he began going on\r\nerrands for Hannah, and was proud and glad to be of use. He accompanied\r\nUncle Bob to his office and arrived home alone in safety. Gradually the\r\nstrangeness of his new home wore away. Every novel sight he beheld,\r\nevery custom which was surprising to him, everything that he did not\r\nunderstand he asked a score of questions about. It was _why_, _why_,\r\n_why_, from morning until night. His questions, fortunately, were\r\nintelligent ones, and as he remembered with accuracy the answers given\r\nhim and applied the knowledge thus gained to future conditions he made\r\namazing headway in becoming Americanized. He got books and read them;\r\nhe visited the churches, Library, and Art Museum. And when he saw how\r\nmuch of its beauty the New World had borrowed from the Old he no longer\r\nfelt cut off from his Italian home.\r\n\r\nUncle Bob, in the meantime, had been forced to plunge so deeply into\r\nbusiness that he had had little opportunity to aid his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 in these\r\nexplorations. But one Saturday noon he came home and announced that he\r\nwas to treat himself to a half holiday.\r\n\r\n"I am not going back to the office to-day," he declared. "Instead I\r\nintend to carry off you two young persons and show you something very\r\nbeautiful, the like of which you will see nowhere else in all the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" cried Jean and Giusippe.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m not telling. Just you be ready directly after luncheon to go\r\nwith me to Cambridge."\r\n\r\n"Cambridge! Oh, I know. It is the University, Mr. Cabot. It is\r\nHarvard!" exclaimed Giusippe, very proud of his knowledge.\r\n\r\n"Not quite," Mr. Cabot said, shaking his head, "although, being a\r\nHarvard man, I naturally feel that the equal of my Alma Mater cannot be\r\nfound elsewhere. But you are on the right track. It is something which\r\nis out at Harvard. Guess again."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," confessed Giusippe.\r\n\r\n"Well, you may be excused because you have not been in this country\r\nlong enough to be acquainted with all its marvels. But Jean should\r\nknow. Where are you, young lady? You at least should be able to tell\r\nwhat treasures America possesses."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I can\'t."\r\n\r\n"Then we must excuse you also; you are so young. I see plainly that we\r\nmust appeal to Hannah. She who is ever extolling Boston can of course\r\ntell us what it is that Harvard University possesses which is\r\nunsurpassed in any other part of the world."\r\n\r\nHannah looked chagrined.\r\n\r\n"You do not know?" went on Uncle Bob teasingly. "Oh, for shame! And you\r\nsuch an ardent Bostonian! Well, so far as I can see there is nothing\r\nfor it but for me to take you all three to Cambridge as fast as ever we\r\ncan get there. Such ignorance is deplorable."\r\n\r\nYou may be very sure that during the ride out from the city every means\r\nwas employed to get Uncle Bob to tell what particular wonder he was to\r\ndisplay. At last, driven to desperation by Jean\'s persistent questions,\r\nhe answered:\r\n\r\n"I will tell you just one fact. The things we are going to see are made\r\nof glass."\r\n\r\n"Glass! But we have already seen everything that ever could be made\r\nfrom glass, Uncle Bob," cried Jean in dismay.\r\n\r\n"No, we haven\'t."\r\n\r\n"Is it stained glass windows?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Mosaics?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"A telescope?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"What is it, Uncle Bob?"\r\n\r\n"Never you mind. You would never guess if you guessed a lifetime. You\r\nbetter give it up," was Mr. Cabot\'s smiling answer.\r\n\r\nCambridge was soon reached, and after a walk through the College Yard\r\nthat Giusippe might have a peep at Holworthy, where Uncle Bob had spent\r\nhis student days, the sightseers entered a quiet old brick building and\r\nwere led by Mr. Cabot into a room where stood case after case of\r\nblooming flowers. There were garden blossoms of every variety, wild\r\nflowers, tropical plants, all fresh and green as if growing. And yet\r\nthey were not growing; instead they lay singly or in clusters, each\r\nbloom as perfect as if just cut from the stalk.\r\n\r\n"How beautiful! Oh, Uncle Bob, it is like a big greenhouse!" exclaimed\r\nJean.\r\n\r\n"This is what I brought you to see."\r\n\r\n"But you said we were coming to see something made of glass," objected\r\nGiusippe.\r\n\r\n"You did say so, Uncle Bob."\r\n\r\n"Behold, even as I said!"\r\n\r\n"Bu-u-t, these flowers are not glass. What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, my unbelieving friends, glass is precisely what they\r\nare made of. Every blossom, every leaf, every bud, every seed here is\r\nthe work of an expert glass-maker."\r\n\r\nMr. Cabot watched their faces, enjoying their incredulity.\r\n\r\n"_Glass_!"\r\n\r\n"Even so. Shall I tell you about it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes! Yes!"\r\n\r\n"This collection of flowers is called the Ware Collection, the name\r\nbeing bestowed out of compliment to Mrs. and Miss Ware, who generously\r\ndonated much of the money for which to pay for it. Sometimes, too, it\r\nis known as the Blaschka Collection of Glass Flower Models, for the\r\nmaking was done by Leopold Blaschka and his son Rudolph, both of whom\r\nwere Bohemians. It happened that several years ago Harvard University\r\nwished to equip its Botanical Department with flower specimens which\r\nmight be used for study by the students. The question at once arose how\r\nthis was to be done. Real flowers would of course fade, and wax flowers\r\nwould melt or break. What could be used? There seemed to be no such\r\nthing as imperishable flowers."\r\n\r\nMr. Cabot paused a moment while the others waited expectantly.\r\n\r\n"There were, however, in the Zo\xc3\xb6logical Department some wonderfully\r\naccurate glass models of animals made by a Bohemian scientist named\r\nBlaschka, who was a rather remarkable combination of scholar and\r\nglass-maker. Accordingly when it became necessary to have fadeless\r\nflowers one of the professors wondered if this same Bohemian could not\r\nreproduce them. So he set out for Blaschka\'s home at Hosterwirtz, near\r\nDresden, to see."\r\n\r\n"Did he have to go way to Germany to find out?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, because in the first place he did not know that Blaschka could\r\nmake flowers at all; and if he could he was not certain that he could\r\nmake them perfectly enough to render them satisfactory for such a\r\npurpose. So he traveled to Germany and found the house where lived the\r\nfamous glass-maker; and it was while waiting alone in the parlor that\r\nhe saw on a shelf a vase containing what seemed to be a very beautiful\r\nfresh orchid."\r\n\r\n"It was made of glass!" Jean declared, leaping at the truth.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and it was so perfect that the Harvard professor could hardly\r\nbelieve his eyes. At that moment the scientist entered. He confessed\r\nthat he had made the flower for his wife; indeed, he had made many\r\nglass orchids--one collection of some sixty varieties which had been\r\nordered by Prince Camille de Rohan, but which had later been destroyed\r\nwhen the Natural History Museum at Li\xc3\xa8ge had been burned. Since then,\r\nBlaschka explained, he had given all his attention to making models of\r\nanimals. He said that his son Rudolph helped him, and that they two\r\nalone knew how the work was done. It was their knowledge of zo\xc3\xb6logy and\r\nof botany added to their skill at glass-making which enabled them to\r\nturn out such correct copies of real objects."\r\n\r\n"Of course the Harvard professor was delighted," Jean ventured.\r\n\r\n"Indeed he was! Before he left he won a promise from Blaschka and his\r\nson to send to Cambridge a few flowers to serve as specimens of what\r\nthey could do. Now you may fancy the rage of the Harvard authorities\r\nwhen on the arrival of the cases of flowers they found that almost all\r\nof them had been broken to bits in the New York Custom House. There\r\nwas, however, enough left of the consignment to give to the Cambridge\r\nprofessors the assurance that the two Bohemians were well equal to the\r\ntask demanded of them. Those who saw the shattered blossoms were most\r\nenthusiastic, and Mrs. Ware and her daughter told the authorities to\r\norder a limited number as a gift to the University. This second lot\r\ncame safely and were so beautiful that Harvard at once arranged that\r\nthe two Blaschkas send over to America all the flowers they could make\r\nfor the next ten years."\r\n\r\n"My!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that seems a great many, doesn\'t it?" Mr. Cabot assented, nodding\r\nto Jean. "But after all, it was not so tremendous as it sounds. You see\r\nHarvard needed a copy of every American flower, plant, and fruit. The\r\nmaking of them would take a great deal of time. Of course unless the\r\ncollection was complete it would be of little use to students. So the\r\nBlaschkas began their work, and for a few years averaged a hundred sets\r\nof flowers a year. Then the father died and Rudolph was left to finish\r\nthe work alone. You remember I told you that in true medi\xc3\xa6val fashion\r\nthey had kept the secret of their art to themselves; as a consequence\r\nthere now was no one to aid the son in his undertaking. Twice he came\r\nto our country to get copies of flowers from which to work, toiling\r\nbravely on in order to finish the task his father had begun. He said he\r\nconsidered it a sort of monument or memorial to the elder man\'s genius.\r\nThere you have the story," concluded Mr. Cabot. "No other such\r\ncollection exists anywhere else in the world. Even with a microscope it\r\nis impossible to distinguish between the real flower and the glass\r\ncopy."\r\n\r\n"How were they made?" Giusippe demanded. "Was the glass blown?"\r\n\r\n"No; the flowers were modeled. That is all I can tell you. The brittle\r\nglass was in some way made plastic so it could be shaped by hand or by\r\ninstruments. Some of the coloring was put on while the material was\r\nhot; some while it was cooling; and some after it was cold. It all\r\ndepended upon the result desired. But one thing is evident--the\r\nBlaschkas worked very quickly and with marvelous scientific accuracy."\r\n\r\n"It is simply wonderful," said Giusippe. "Even at Murano there is\r\nnothing to equal this."\r\n\r\n"I thought you, who knew so much of glass-making, would appreciate what\r\nsuch a collection represents in knowledge, toil, and skill. Furthermore\r\nit is beautiful, and for that reason alone is well worth seeing,"\r\nanswered Mr. Cabot.\r\n\r\n"It is wonderful!" repeated the Italian lad.\r\n\r\nAll the way home the young Venetian was peculiarly silent. His national\r\npride had received a blow. Bohemia had surpassed Venice at its own\r\ntrade, the art of glass-making!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nJEAN THREATENS TO STEAL GIUSIPPE\'S TRADE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the next morning while Mr. Cabot and Giusippe were still\r\ndiscussing the Blaschka glass flowers that the Italian lad remarked:\r\n\r\n"I have wondered and wondered ever since we went out to Harvard how\r\nthose fragile flower models were annealed without breaking. It must\r\nhave been very difficult."\r\n\r\n"What is annealing?" inquired Jean, holding at arm\'s length a doll\'s\r\nhat and straightening a feather at one side of it.\r\n\r\n"Annealing? Why, the gradual cooling of the glass after it has been\r\nheated."\r\n\r\n"What do they heat it for?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know how glass is made?" Giusippe asked in surprise.\r\n\r\nJean shook her head.\r\n\r\n"No. How should I?"\r\n\r\n"Why--but I thought every one knew that!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why. How could a girl know about the work you men do\r\nunless you take the trouble to tell her?" Jean dimpled. "All through\r\nEurope you and Uncle Bob have talked glass, glass, glass--nothing but\r\nglass, and as you both seemed to understand what you were talking about\r\nI did not like to interrupt and ask questions; but I had no more idea\r\nthan the man in the moon what you meant sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say you know nothing at all about the process of\r\nglass-making, Jean?" asked Mr. Cabot.\r\n\r\n"Not a thing."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, well! You have been a very patient little lady, that is\r\nall I can say. Giusippe and I have been both rude and remiss, haven\'t\r\nwe, Giusippe? I thought of course you understood; and yet it is not at\r\nall strange that you did not. As you say, how could you? Why didn\'t you\r\nask us, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I didn\'t like to. I hate to seem stupid and be a bother."\r\n\r\n"You are neither of those things, dear child. Is she, Giusippe?"\r\n\r\n"I should say not."\r\n\r\n"Well then, if it is all the same to you, I do wish somebody would tell\r\nme whether glass is dug up out of the earth or is made of things mixed\r\ntogether like a pudding," said Jean.\r\n\r\nBoth Giusippe and Uncle Bob laughed.\r\n\r\n"The pudding idea is the nearer correct. Glass is made from ingredients\r\nwhich are mixed together, boiled, baked, and set away to cool. Isn\'t\r\nthat about it, Giusippe?"\r\n\r\nGiusippe nodded.\r\n\r\n"I think the best remedy we can administer to this young lady, as well\r\nas the most fitting penance for our own discourtesy to her, is to\r\nescort her through a glass factory and let her, with her own eyes,\r\nbehold the process. What do you say, Giusippe?"\r\n\r\n"A capital idea, se\xc3\xb1or. Then I, too, should have the chance to visit an\r\nAmerican factory and compare the process you use here with our Italian\r\nmethod. I should like it above everything else."\r\n\r\n"That is precisely what we will do then," declared Mr. Cabot. "On my\r\nfirst leisure day we will go, and in the meantime I will hunt up the\r\nlocation of the most satisfactory and nearest glass works."\r\n\r\nNot more than a week passed before Uncle Bob fulfilled his promise.\r\n\r\n"Make yourselves ready, oh ye glass-makers," said he one morning at\r\nbreakfast. "I find after telephoning to the office that I am not needed\r\nto-day; therefore, the moment we have swallowed these estimable griddle\r\ncakes of Hannah\'s we will hie us forth to instruct Jean in the art of\r\nmanufacturing vases, bottles, tumblers and the various sorts of\r\nglassware."\r\n\r\nThe two young people greeted the suggestion with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"Can you really get away to-day, Uncle Bob?" cried Jean. "What fun\r\nwe\'ll have!"\r\n\r\n"I think it will be fun. We must, however, make Giusippe captain of the\r\nexpedition for he is the one who really knows glass-making from\r\nbeginning to end, and can answer all our questions."\r\n\r\n"I think I might in Murano," returned the Venetian modestly, "but that\r\nis no sign that I can do it here; your process may differ from the one\r\nwe use at home."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do not believe so--at least, not in essentials," Mr. Cabot\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nSo they started out, and before they had proceeded any distance at all\r\nthey got into a spirited debate over the tiny lights of glass set in\r\nthe top of the electric car. The panes were of ground glass dotted with\r\nan all-over pattern of small stars which had been left transparent.\r\n\r\n"How did they make the stars on that glass?" was Jean\'s innocent\r\nquestion. "Did they scratch off the thick surface and leave the design\r\nof clear glass?"\r\n\r\n"No indeed," Mr. Cabot replied. "On the contrary they started with the\r\nstars and then made the background cloudy."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t see how they could."\r\n\r\n"Do you, Giusippe?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid not, se\xc3\xb1or."\r\n\r\n"Good! At last there is one fact about glass-making that I can impart\r\nto you. This sort of glass is known as sand-blast glass, and the art of\r\nmaking it, they say, chanced to be discovered near the seashore. It was\r\nfound that when the strong winds rose and blew the sand against glass\r\nwindow-panes of the houses the small particles, being sharp, cut into\r\nthe glass surface, and before long wore it to a cloudy white through\r\nwhich it was impossible to see out. Often the glass fronts of\r\nlighthouses were injured in this way and the lights dimmed. Finally\r\nsome man came along who said: \'See here! Why not turn this grinding\r\neffect of the sand to some purpose? Why not apply it to transparent\r\nglass and make it frosted so one can get light but not see through it?\r\nOften such glass would be a convenience.\' Therefore this inventor set\r\nhis brain to the task. Strong currents or streams of sand were directed\r\nagainst a clear glass surface with such force that they cut and ground\r\nit until it was no longer transparent. They called the product thus\r\nmade sand-blast glass. Later they improved upon it by laying a stencil\r\nover it so that a desired design was covered and remained protected\r\nfrom the sand blast. The result was a pattern such as you see--clear\r\nfigures set in a background of clouded glass."\r\n\r\n"How interesting!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, isn\'t it? As is true of so many other of our most clever\r\ninventions nature first showed man the path. Ground glass in its\r\nmodified forms is used for many purposes now; and yet I venture to say\r\nfew persons know how it came to be discovered."\r\n\r\nJust at this point the car stopped with a sudden jerk, and beckoning\r\nJean and Giusippe to follow, Mr. Cabot got out and entered a large\r\nbrick building that stood close at hand. Evidently he was expected, for\r\na man came forward to greet him.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cabot?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I received your note this morning, so I brought my young charges\r\nout at once. It is very good of you to allow us to go through the\r\nfactory."\r\n\r\n"We are always glad to see visitors. I will put you in the hands of one\r\nof our foremen who will take you about and tell you everything you may\r\nwant to know."\r\n\r\nHe touched a bell.\r\n\r\n"Show Mr. Cabot and his friends down-stairs," said he to the boy who\r\nanswered his call, "and introduce them to Mr. Wyman. Tell him he is to\r\nconduct them over the works."\r\n\r\nMr. Wyman welcomed them cordially.\r\n\r\n"We see many visitors here, sir," said he, "and are always glad to have\r\nthem come. Although glass-making is an old story to us scarce a day\r\npasses that some one does not visit us to whom the process is entirely\r\nnew; and it certainly is interesting if a person has never seen it.\r\nSuppose we begin at the very beginning. In this bin, or trough, you\r\nwill see the mixture or batch of which the glass is made. It is\r\ncomposed of red lead and the finest of white beach sand. The lead is\r\nwhat gives the inside of the trough its vermilion color. The sand comes\r\nfrom abroad, and before it can be used it must be sifted and sifted\r\nthrough a series of closely woven cloths until it is smooth and fine as\r\npowder. Before we put the mixture into the melting pots we heat it to a\r\ngiven temperature so that it will be less likely to chill the clay pots\r\nand break them."\r\n\r\n"Do you really make glass by melting up that stuff?" asked Jean\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\nThe man smiled.\r\n\r\n"But isn\'t it all red?"\r\n\r\n"The red comes out in the melting. We have to be very careful, however,\r\nin weighing out the ingredients, for much of our success depends on the\r\naccurate proportions of the materials combined in the batch. Of course\r\nthe chemical composition differs some for different sorts of glass. It\r\nall depends on what kind of glass is to be made. Then too the\r\nconditions of the furnaces vary at times, the draughts being better at\r\nsome seasons than at others. We take a test or proof of every fresh\r\nmelt, and you would be surprised to see how little these differ.\r\nCareful mixing of the raw materials is the first important item of\r\nsuccessful glass-making; the second is the fusion by heat of the\r\nmaterials."\r\n\r\n"The batch is next melted, Jean," explained Giusippe, as they followed\r\nMr. Wyman into the great brick-paved room where the furnaces were.\r\n\r\nHere indeed was a picturesque scene. Numberless men were hurrying\r\nhither and thither, some whirling in the air glowing masses of molten\r\nglass; others standing before the furnace doors gathering balls of it\r\non the end of long iron blow-pipes which were from six to nine feet in\r\nlength. Everybody was scurrying. As soon as a ball of red-hot glass had\r\nbeen collected on the end of a blow-pipe it was rushed off to the\r\nblower before it cooled. In and out of the throng of moving workmen\r\nyoung boys, or carriers, swung along bearing to the annealing ovens on\r\ncharred wooden trays or forks newly completed vases or pitchers.\r\n\r\nJean glanced about, fascinated by the bustling crowd.\r\n\r\n"Here are the furnaces," the foreman said. "Each one has twelve\r\nopenings and is built with a low dome to keep in the heat. The flues or\r\nchimneys are in the sides of the furnace. Within, and just beneath the\r\nopenings or working-holes, stand the great clay pots of molten batch.\r\nThese pots are made for us from New Jersey clay; formerly we used to\r\nmake them ourselves, but it was a great deal of trouble, and we now\r\nfind it simpler to buy them. They vary in cost from thirty to\r\nseventy-five dollars, according to their size."\r\n\r\n"And they are liable to break the first time they are used," whispered\r\nGiusippe in a jesting undertone.\r\n\r\nMr. Wyman caught his words.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you know something of glass-making then, my young man?"\r\n\r\n"A little."\r\n\r\n"The pots are, as you say, a great lottery. Sometimes one will be in\r\nconstant use three months or longer, and do good service; on the other\r\nhand a pot may break the first time using and let all the melt into the\r\nfurnace. Then we have a lively time, I can tell you, ladling it out,\r\nand taking care in the meantime that none of the other pots are upset."\r\n\r\nGiusippe nodded appreciatively.\r\n\r\nMany a day just such a catastrophe had occurred when he had been\r\nworking; vividly he recalled how all the men had been forced to come to\r\nthe rescue.\r\n\r\n"Are the pots filled to the top with batch?" asked Mr. Cabot.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we charge them pretty solid; but the raw material loses bulk in\r\nmelting, so they have to be filled in as the melt settles. At the end\r\nof ten or twelve hours we have a refilling or _topping out_, as we\r\ncall it; usually this is enough. The first fill must become fluid and\r\nits gases must escape before any more material is added; we also have\r\nto be sure when we put the pots in the furnace that the temperature is\r\nhigh enough to melt the batch immediately, or the glass will go bad."\r\n\r\n"What do you use for fuel?"\r\n\r\n"Crude oil. In the West they can get natural gas, and there they often\r\nmelt the batch in tanks instead of pots. But we find crude oil quite\r\nsatisfactory. You can readily understand that we cannot burn any fuel\r\nthat gives off a waste product such as coal dust or cinders, because if\r\nwe did such matter would get into the melt and speck the glass, causing\r\nit to be imperfect. Much of the work done by the earliest glass-makers\r\nwas specked in this way, and in fact the genuineness of old glass is\r\nsometimes determined from these very imperfections."\r\n\r\n"I see," Mr. Cabot nodded.\r\n\r\n"After the melt is in a fluid state it throws to the top, provided the\r\nheat is sufficient, many impurities such as bubbles and scum. These\r\nare, of course, skimmed off--a process called plaining. Afterward the\r\nhot material has to be cooled before it can be worked, and reduced\r\nfrom fluid to a thicker consistency. This we call _standing off_ or\r\n_fining_."\r\n\r\n"How long does it take to melt the batch and get it ready to use?"\r\n\r\n"About three days. We run a relay of furnaces--three of them--and plan\r\nso that a melt will be ready to be worked every other day; in that way\r\nwe keep plenty of usable material on hand."\r\n\r\n"And then?"\r\n\r\n"Then we are ready to go ahead and blow it. We make nothing but the\r\nbetter grades of blown glass here; that is, no window glass or cheap\r\npressed ware. Of course there are some patterns, such as fluted designs\r\nand their like, which cannot be entirely fashioned by the blower;\r\ntherefore these are first blown as nearly the required size as possible\r\nand are then made into the desired form by shutting them inside iron\r\nmoulds and squeezing them into the proper shape. You shall see it done\r\nlater on."\r\n\r\nHe now led them up to where a gatherer stood at one of the\r\nworking-holes of the furnace.\r\n\r\n"This man," explained Mr. Wyman, "is collecting on his blow-pipe enough\r\nglass to make a pitcher. He uses his judgment as to the amount\r\nnecessary, but so often has he estimated it that he seldom gets either\r\ntoo much or too little. He will next carry it to the blower, who will\r\nblow it into a long, pear-shaped cylinder the size he wants the pitcher\r\nto be."\r\n\r\nThey followed, and with much interest watched a great Swede fill his\r\nlungs and blow into the smaller end of the iron pipe with all his\r\nstrength; immediately the ball of soft, red-hot glass began to take\r\nform. With incredible speed the blower flattened its base upon a marver\r\nor table topped with sheet iron. A short iron rod or pontil was next\r\nfastened to the middle of the bottom of the pitcher in order that the\r\nblower might hold it, and after this had been done the blow-pipe was\r\ndetached. The glass-maker sat in a sort of backless chair which had\r\nlong, flat, metal-covered arms at either side, and as he worked he\r\nrolled the rod with its plastic material back and forth along one of\r\nthese iron arms to shape it. He then took his shears and, making an\r\nincision at the middle of the back of the jug, he began to cut the top\r\ninto the shape he wanted it, depending entirely on his eye for the\r\noutline. Then quick as a flash he seized a bit of round metal not\r\nunlike a beet in shape and, pressing it inside the soft glass, made the\r\ndepression for the nose. All this was done in much less time than it\r\ntakes to tell it. A small boy, or carrier, now bobbed up at just the\r\nproper moment and taking the pitcher on his wooden fork carried it off\r\nto a small furnace where it was reheated at the opening or "glory\r\nhole." This little furnace, Mr. Wyman said, was used only for the\r\npurpose of softening glass objects which became chilled in the modeling\r\nand began to be hard and less pliable. As soon as the boy brought the\r\npitcher back another lad, as if calculating by magic the precise moment\r\nat which to appear, approached with a small mass of molten glass at the\r\nend of his gathering-iron. This he stuck firmly against the pitcher at\r\nthe correct spot to form the base of the handle; the modeler snipped\r\noff with his shears as much of the soft glass as he thought necessary,\r\nturned it up, and in the twinkling of an eye fastened the upper end of\r\nthe handle in place. Then he surveyed his handiwork an instant to make\r\nsure that it was symmetrical, straightened it just a shade with his\r\nbattledore of charred wood, and passed it over to the carrier, who bore\r\nit off to be baked.\r\n\r\n"Why do they use so much charred wood for the shaping?" inquired Jean.\r\n\r\n"Metal things are liable to mark the glass, leaving upon it a print,\r\nscratch, or other imperfection; charred wood, when worn down, is\r\nabsolutely smooth and cannot mar the material."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I see. And where have they taken the pitcher now?"\r\n\r\n"We will follow it," replied the foreman.\r\n\r\nEscorting them across the room he showed them a low oven or kiln. The\r\ndoor of it was open, and inside they could see all sorts of glassware\r\nwhich had just been finished.\r\n\r\n"Here is where your pitcher will remain for the next three days," said\r\nhe. "We build a fire, put the completed glass in the oven, and leave it\r\nthere until the fire goes out and the oven gradually cools; we call the\r\nprocess annealing. It prevents the glass from breaking when exposed to\r\nfriction or to the atmosphere. Glass is very brittle, and extremely\r\nsensitive to heat and cold. If it were not annealed it would not be\r\nstrong, and would snap to pieces the moment it came in contact with the\r\nouter air. Now it is very difficult to anneal glass, the trouble being\r\nthat all hollow ware is one temperature on the inside and another on\r\nthe outside. Hence, when heated, the inside takes longer to cool. Any\r\ncurrent of cold air that strikes it will fracture it. So, as you can\r\nreadily see, an annealing kiln or oven must be arranged in such a way\r\nthat it will allow the two surfaces to cool simultaneously."\r\n\r\n"I think I understand," answered Jean. "And you say these things must\r\nstay in the kiln about three days?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the kiln takes about that time. It is a slow process, because we\r\nhave practically no way of regulating its heat. A lehr does the work\r\nmuch quicker. Over here you will see one. It is a long arch or oven\r\nopen at both ends. The glassware travels in iron pans along a moving\r\nsurface from the hot oven, or receiving end, to the cool, or\r\ndischarging end. The temperature of the lehr can be scientifically\r\ntested and regulated, and this is very necessary, because the heavy\r\nglass intended for cutting can stand a greater heat than can ordinary\r\nhollow ware such as vials and table glass. We regulate the oven\r\naccording to what we are annealing in it. It does not take so long to\r\nanneal glass in a lehr as in a kiln, and therefore in many factories\r\nonly lehrs are used. If you will come around to the cool end you can\r\nsee some of the finished pieces being taken out. Each object is made by\r\na certain set or gang of workmen--a shop, we call it. The work of each\r\nshop when taken from the lehr is put in a box by itself and is then\r\ncounted up, and the men paid according to the number of perfect objects\r\nfinished. It is piece work. For instance, one shop makes only pitchers,\r\nanother wine-glasses, another vases, and so on. Every group has its\r\nspecialty, and each workman in the team understands exactly what his\r\npart is in the whole. The common interest of turning out as many\r\nperfect pieces as possible spurs each man to work as rapidly, well, and\r\nhelpfully as he can."\r\n\r\n"Just like a football squad, Uncle Bob," laughed Jean.\r\n\r\n"Exactly," nodded Mr. Wyman. "After the finished glass is taken from\r\nthe kiln or lehr it goes to the examining room, where girls dip it in\r\nclear water and hold it to the light to test it for imperfections; then\r\nit is sorted, packed, and shipped."\r\n\r\n"And vases, sugar-bowls, tumblers, and most of the hollow glassware is\r\nmade in the same way?" inquired Mr. Cabot.\r\n\r\n"Yes, practically so. The general scheme is the same. As I told you,\r\nthere are some difficult designs which must be squeezed into shape in\r\nmoulds. These are of iron, and for the convenience of the blowers are\r\nset in holes in the floor. They are made in two parts joined by a\r\nhinge. The molten glass is blown to the approximate size and then a boy\r\nshuts it inside the mould and the blower blows into it until it has\r\nentirely filled out the mould in which it is confined. When released it\r\nis shaped to the form required."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "IT IS SHAPED TO THE FORM REQUIRED"]\r\n\r\n"But doesn\'t it stick to the mould?"\r\n\r\n"Seldom. The moulds are painted over on the inside with a preparation\r\nwhich prevents the glass from sticking."\r\n\r\n"Do you cut any glass here?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. Cut glass is made from the heavier crystal variety. The\r\ndesign is roughly outlined upon it in white and then the cutter places\r\nthe part to be cut against an emery-wheel, which grinds out the grooves\r\nand figures and makes the pattern. Just above each cutter\'s revolving\r\nwheel is suspended a funnel of wet sand, and this drops at intervals\r\nupon the turning disc and cools it; otherwise it would become so hot\r\nfrom the friction that it could not be used. After the design has been\r\ncut on the emery-wheel all its rough edges are smoothed off on a stone\r\nof much finer grain. I can show you our glass cutters at work if you\r\nwould care to see them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, do let\'s see them, Uncle Bob," begged Jean.\r\n\r\n"All right; but only for a few moments. We have already taken too much\r\nof Mr. Wyman\'s time, I fear. And besides, I must be back in town for\r\nluncheon," answered Mr. Cabot.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they went on into the next room, where Jean became so\r\nfascinated by the whirring wheels and the men whose steady hands guided\r\nthem that it was with difficulty she could be persuaded to leave and\r\nstart for home.\r\n\r\n"Do you think, little lady, that when you get back to Boston you can\r\nmix up some glass for us and bake it in Hannah\'s oven?" questioned\r\nUncle Bob of her when they were at last in the car.\r\n\r\n"I am not sure," replied the girl with a bright smile. "But certainly I\r\nhave a much clearer idea how to do it than I had before I went out to\r\nthe factory. In future when you and Giusippe talk glass-making I can at\r\nleast be a bit more intelligent. I think, too, I appreciate now how\r\nwonderful it was that the Egyptians, Persians, and Syrians discovered\r\nin those far-off days how to make glass. I am not at all sure,\r\nGiusippe, that when we go to Pittsburgh I shall not steal your trade\r\nand apply to Uncle Tom for a place in his factory."\r\n\r\nMr. Cabot pinched her cheek playfully.\r\n\r\n"I guess you\'d better stick to dressing dolls," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nA REUNION\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length all too soon for Uncle Bob and Hannah, and indeed far sooner\r\nthan Jean and Giusippe had realized, October came, and the time for\r\nstarting for Pittsburgh was at hand. To the young people their\r\ndeparture was not without its anticipations. Jean longed to see Beacon\r\nand Uncle Tom, and Giusippe burned with eagerness to take up the\r\nposition his uncle had secured for him at Mr. Curtis\'s factory.\r\n\r\n"How odd it is, Giusippe," Jean mused one day, "that we each have an\r\nuncle waiting for us. And besides that you have an aunt, too, haven\'t\r\nyou? I wish I had. I\'d love to have an aunt! As it is I have only\r\nBeacon."\r\n\r\n"Maybe you\'ll have one some day," was Giusippe\'s vaguely consoling\r\nanswer. "But anyway I shouldn\'t think you would care much. You have\r\nMiss Cartright, and she is almost as good as an aunt."\r\n\r\n"I suppose she is something like one," admitted Jean, "only, you see,\r\nshe doesn\'t live where I do, so I can\'t see her very often. Of course\r\nshe has sent me nice letters since she got home to New York and\r\nsometimes she writes Uncle Bob, too; but it isn\'t really like seeing\r\nher. When I think that the day after to-morrow she is to meet us in New\r\nYork it seems too good to be true. Won\'t it be fun? I love Miss\r\nCartright! Do you suppose she looks just the same as she did when she\r\nwas with us on the steamer?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. Your uncle said she did when he saw her in New York."\r\n\r\n"I know it. He has had lots of chances to see her because he has been\r\nover there so many times on business trips. I wish we had. But we shall\r\nsee her now, anyway. Oh, I am so glad!" Jean whirled enthusiastically\r\nround the room. "I think we are to have a pretty nice visit in New York\r\nif we do all the things Uncle Bob is planning to. He says he is going\r\nto take us to the studio of one of his friends and show us how stained\r\nglass windows are made. I shall like to see that, sha\'n\'t you?"\r\n\r\nSo the boy and girl chattered on little dreaming, in the delight of the\r\npleasures in store for them, how lonely at heart were Mr. Cabot and\r\npoor Hannah.\r\n\r\n"If it wasn\'t that Jean is coming back in the spring I should be\r\ncompletely inconsolable," lamented Hannah. "I cannot bear to part with\r\nthe child. But she will surely be back again, won\'t she, Mr. Bob? There\r\nwon\'t be any other plan made? You\'ll certainly insist that Mr. Curtis\r\nsend her home to us in May, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"There, there, Hannah, dry your eyes. Of course Jean will be back. I\r\nhave no more mind to lose her than you have. No one knows how I love\r\nthat child! I\'d no more let her leave my home than I would cut off my\r\nright hand," was Mr. Cabot\'s vehement reply.\r\n\r\n"The boy is a splendid fellow, too," Hannah went on. "He has the\r\nmakings of a fine man, Mr. Bob."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Giusippe is a very unusual lad. As time goes on I am more and\r\nmore convinced that we made no mistake in bringing him to America. I am\r\nsure that we are adding a good citizen to the country. I have a feeling\r\nthat Mr. Curtis will be much interested in him."\r\n\r\n"I wish he\'d be sufficiently interested to adopt him and send Jean home\r\nto us," suggested Hannah, smoothing out the edge of an apron she was\r\nhemming.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid such a scheme as that would be too good to be true,"\r\nlaughed Mr. Cabot. "If, however, he helps place Giusippe in a fine\r\nbusiness position I shall be satisfied. That is all I shall ask."\r\n\r\nNevertheless, brave as Uncle Bob tried to be, he was very solemn the\r\nmorning he saw the trunks brought down-stairs and strapped on the back\r\nof the waiting cab.\r\n\r\n"Cheer up, Hannah!" he called from the sidewalk. "Why, bless my soul,\r\nif you\'re not crying! Come, come, this will never do! May will be here\r\nbefore you know it, and the child will be back again. She is only going\r\non a visit--remember that. Her home is here. Say good-bye to Hannah,\r\nyou young scamps. She somehow seems to have the notion you are never to\r\nreturn. Tell her she is not to get off so easily. Before many moons she\r\nwill find you two in the pantry raiding the cookie jar just as you\r\nrobbed it yesterday--you bandits!"\r\n\r\nAnd so with a gaiety he did not feel Mr. Cabot hustled his charges into\r\nthe carriage and slammed the door.\r\n\r\nThe trip to New York was a blur of new impressions and the city itself,\r\nwhen they reached it, another blur--a confusion of madly rushing\r\nthrongs; giant sky-scrapers; racing taxicabs; and clanging bells. To\r\nthe children it seemed a maelstrom of horror. Their one thought was to\r\nget safely out of the crowd, have something to eat, and go to bed. But\r\nwith the morning light New York took on quite a different aspect. It\r\nproved to be not such a bad place after all. The solitary fact that it\r\nharbored Miss Cartright was quite enough to redeem it in their eyes.\r\nThen there was so much to see which was new and strange! Directly after\r\nbreakfast Uncle Bob took them out for a stroll and after a walk in the\r\nbrisk air he led them into Tiffany\'s.\r\n\r\n"While we have time and are right here I want to show you one of the\r\nmost wonderful glass products of America," said he. "It is called\r\nFavril glass and is made at Coronna, Long Island. Just how, I do not\r\nknow. The process is a secret one. You remember, don\'t you, the\r\nmarvelous iridescent colors of the ancient Egyptian glass we saw in the\r\nBritish Museum? And you recall how exquisite was the turquoise glaze on\r\nsome of the old pieces? Well, the Tiffany people have tried to imitate\r\nthat, and so well have they succeeded that they have received many\r\nmedals in recognition of their skill. Museums all over the world from\r\nTokio to Christiania have purchased collections of the glass that it\r\nmay be exhibited and enjoyed by young and old. I am going to show you\r\nsome of it now."\r\n\r\nUp in an elevator they sped, and alighting at one of the upper floors\r\nUncle Bob led the way into a room rich with silken hangings and rare\r\noriental rugs; all about this room were vases, plates, lamp-shades, and\r\nornaments of beautiful hues. There were great golden glass bowls\r\nglinting with elusive lights of violet, blue, and yellow; there were\r\nvases opalescent with burning flecks of orange and copper; there were\r\ngreen glass plates and globes which shaded into tones of blue as\r\ndelicate as mother-of-pearl.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" sighed Jean rapturously, "I never saw anything so lovely! Look at\r\nthese plates, Uncle Bob, do look at them. How ever did they get the\r\ncolor? It is like a sunset."\r\n\r\n"The Tiffanys, like Blaschka the flower modeler, are not telling the\r\nworld how they get their results. Rest assured, however, many and many\r\nhours must have been spent in experiments before such artistic products\r\ncould be obtained."\r\n\r\n"Think of the struggles with color and with firing," Giusippe murmured.\r\n\r\n"And the pieces that must have been spoiled!" put in Jean.\r\n\r\n"But think of the triumph of at last taking from the lehrs such gems as\r\nthese! The results which air, soil, and age have by chance produced in\r\nthe ancient Egyptian and Gr\xc3\xa6co-Syrian glass the Tiffanys have created\r\nin a modern ware. It is a great achievement, and a royal contribution\r\nto the art of the world."\r\n\r\nThe children would have been glad to linger for a much longer time in\r\nthe vast shop had not the chime of a clock warned them that the noon\r\nhour, when they were to meet Miss Cartright, was approaching. She had\r\npromised to lunch with them all at the Holland House.\r\n\r\nYes, she looked just the same, "only prettier," Jean whispered to\r\nGiusippe. Certainly there was an added glow of beauty on her cheek and\r\na new sweetness in her smile. How glad she was to see them! And how\r\nglad, glad, glad they were to see her. Miraculously from somewhere\r\nUncle Bob produced a great bunch of violets which she fastened in her\r\ngown and then amid a confusion of merry chatter and laughter they went\r\nin to luncheon.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a royal luncheon!\r\n\r\nUncle Bob seemed inclined to order everything on the menu, and it was\r\nnot until Miss Cartright protested that not only the young people but\r\nshe herself would be ill, that he was to be stayed. And what a joke it\r\nwas when the waiter bent down and asked her if both her son and\r\ndaughter would take some of the hot chocolate!\r\n\r\nOh, it was a jolly luncheon!\r\n\r\nAnd after it was finished and they all had declared that not until next\r\nThanksgiving could they think of eating anything more, off they shot in\r\na taxicab to the studio of Uncle Bob\'s friend, Mr. Norcross, who had\r\npromised over the telephone to show them the window he was making for a\r\nchurch in Chicago.\r\n\r\nThey found the studio at the top of one of New York\'s high buildings,\r\nand it was flooded with light from the west and south; on one side of\r\nthe room was an open space large enough to allow an immense stained\r\nglass window to be set up.\r\n\r\nMr. Norcross, who was an old college friend of Uncle Bob\'s, greeted\r\nthem cordially and when Miss Cartright remarked on the airiness of his\r\nworkshop he answered:\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have plenty of air up here; of course I enjoy it, too. But air,\r\nafter all, is not the important factor which I consider. My stock in\r\ntrade is light. Without it I could do nothing. Through the medium of\r\nstrong sunlight I must test my work, for stained glass is beautiful\r\nchiefly as the light plays through it. It is not a tapestry nor a\r\npicture--it is primarily a window. Its colors must be rich in the light\r\nbut not glaring; and its design must be so thoughtfully executed that\r\nthe telling figures will stand forth when there is a strong sunset, for\r\ninstance, behind them."\r\n\r\n"Of course, then, you must take care that the colors you use do not\r\nprove too powerful and overshadow your central figures," said Miss\r\nCartright.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you paint?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but not as I want to," was the wistful answer. "I do portraits.\r\nSo I can readily see that your problem is a unique, and far more\r\ndifficult one than mine. I have only a changeless color scheme to\r\nconsider, while your colors shift with every cloud that passes across\r\nthe sky."\r\n\r\nMr. Norcross nodded with pleasure at her instant appreciation of his\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever seen stained glass in the making?" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Neither have any of the rest of us, Norcross," put in Mr. Cabot. "That\r\nis what we came for. I have been toting these two youthful friends of\r\nmine all over the world and together we have investigated almost every\r\nknown form of glass, from the Naples Vase down to an American lamp\r\nchimney."\r\n\r\nMr. Norcross smiled.\r\n\r\n"So you see," Uncle Bob went on, "I wanted them to witness this phase\r\nof glass-making."\r\n\r\n"They certainly shall. How did you chance to be so interested in the\r\nmaking of glass?" inquired the artist, turning to Giusippe.\r\n\r\n"I am a Venetian, se\xc3\xb1or. For over six generations my people have been\r\nat Murano."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then, what wonder! And that accounts for your own personal color\r\nscheme."\r\n\r\nThe artist let his eyes dwell upon the Italian\'s face intently: then\r\nglanced at Miss Cartright.\r\n\r\n"I did a portrait of Giusippe," she responded quietly, "when I was in\r\nVenice a few years ago. He did not look so much like an American then."\r\n\r\n"Modern clothing certainly does take the picturesqueness out of some of\r\nus," answered Mr. Cabot.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Giusippe had wandered off to the distant side of the\r\nstudio and now stood before a large glass panel calling excitedly:\r\n\r\n"Is this the window you are making, se\xc3\xb1or? How beautiful! The violet\r\nlight behind the woman\'s head, and that yellow glow on her hair--it is\r\nwonderful! And her white drapery against the background of green!"\r\n\r\nMr. Norcross came to his side, flushing with gratification.\r\n\r\n"The mellow tones playing on her hair were hard to get. I spent a lot\r\nof time working at them. It isn\'t easy to get the results one wants\r\nwhen making stained glass."\r\n\r\n"What did you do first, Mr. Norcross, when you began the window?" asked\r\nJean timidly.\r\n\r\n"I will show you every step I have taken in doing it if you would like\r\nto follow the process. In the first place I went to Chicago and studied\r\nthe light and the setting which it was to have. Then I made this small\r\nwater-color design and submitted it for approval to the persons who\r\nwere ordering the window. The drawing accepted, I set about making a\r\nfull-sized cartoon which I sketched in with charcoal on this heavy\r\npaper; the black lines represent the leading and the horizontal\r\nstay-bars necessary to hold the glass in place. After that I sliced up\r\nmy cartoon into a multitude of small pieces from which the glass could\r\nbe cut and the lead lines decided upon. All this done I went to work\r\nplanning my color scheme--thinking out what dominating colors I would\r\nuse and where I would place my high lights."\r\n\r\n"And then you were ready for your glass?" inquired Mr. Cabot.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Now selecting the glass is not alone a matter of color; it is\r\nalso a problem of thickness. Sometimes a variation in tone can be\r\nobtained merely by using a bit of heavier glass in some one spot. Again\r\nthe effect must be obtained by the use of paint."\r\n\r\n"What kind of glass do you use, Mr. Norcross?" Giusippe questioned.\r\n\r\n"What we call bottle, or Norman, glass. We get it from England, and\r\nstrangely enough there is a heavy duty on it in its raw state. One can\r\nimport a whole window free of duty because it is listed as an art work;\r\nbut the glass out of which an art work is to be constructed costs a\r\nvery high price. Odd, isn\'t it? As soon as I reach the point of using\r\nglass I arrange it on a large plate glass easel, using wax in the\r\nspaces where the lead is to go. Then I experiment and experiment with\r\nmy colors. You probably know that in making modern stained glass a\r\ngreat deal of paint is used in order to get shading and degrees of\r\ncolor. It was toward the end of the thirteenth century that the old\r\nglass-makers began to introduce the use of paint into their windows.\r\nFirst came the grisaille glass, as it was called, where instead of\r\nstrong reds and blues most of the window was in white painted with\r\nscroll work in which a few bits of brilliant stained glass were set\r\nlike jewels. Then with the fourteenth century came those elaborate\r\npainted canopies and borders within which were the main figures of the\r\nwindow in stained glass. From that time on the combination of stained\r\nand painted glass was used. Accordingly we all work by that method now.\r\nSo, as I say, I paint in my glass and afterward it has to be fired, all\r\nthe small pieces being laid out on heavy sheets of steel covered with\r\nplaster of paris."\r\n\r\n"Do your colors always come out as you mean to have them?" inquired\r\nGiusippe, his eyes on the artist\'s face.\r\n\r\nMr. Norcross shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"You know, don\'t you, how the firing often changes the tone, and how\r\nyou frequently get a color you neither intended nor desired. That is\r\none of the tribulations of stained glass making. Another is when the\r\ncutters must trim down the glass and put the lead in place. You may not\r\nrealize that there are three widths of lead from which to select; it is\r\nnot always easy to choose for every part of the design the thickness\r\nwhich will look the best. For instance, sometimes the leading will be\r\ntoo strong and overwhelm the picture; again it will be too weak and\r\nrender the window characterless."\r\n\r\n"It must be a fascinating puzzle to work out," mused Miss Cartright.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but it is also a great test of the patience."\r\n\r\n"Were the old glass windows made in this same way, do you suppose?"\r\nasked Jean after a pause.\r\n\r\n"I presume the old glass-makers worked along the same general plan,\r\nalthough they may not have followed exactly the present-day methods;\r\ncertain it is, however, that they knew all the many tricks or devices\r\nfor getting color effects--knew them far better than we do now. And\r\nthey put endless time and thought into their work, no artist feeling it\r\nbeneath his dignity to follow the humblest detail of his conception. He\r\nwatched over his art-child until it got to be full-grown. This is the\r\nonly way to get fine results. For, you see, there is no set rule for a\r\nglass designer to apply. Each window presents a fresh problem in the\r\nmanagement of light and color. There is no branch of art more elusive\r\nor more difficult than this. I must be able to construct a window which\r\nwill be satisfactory as a flat piece of decoration; it must be\r\nsufficiently interesting to give pleasure even when it stands in a dim\r\nlight. Then presto--the sun moves round, and my window is transformed!\r\nAnd in the flood of light that passes through it I must still be able\r\nto find it beautiful."\r\n\r\n"I think that I should like to learn to make stained glass," declared\r\nGiusippe, who had become so absorbed that he had moved close beside Mr.\r\nNorcross.\r\n\r\n"Would you?"\r\n\r\nThe artist smiled down kindly at him. "In your country you have many a\r\nfine example of glass. France, too, is rich in rose windows which are\r\nthe despair of our modern craftsmen. But we glass-makers are working\r\nhard and earnestly, and who knows but in time we may give to the world\r\nsuch glass as is at Rheims, Tours, Amiens, and Chartres."\r\n\r\n"What sort of paint do you use?" asked Mr. Cabot as he took up a brush\r\nand idly examined it in his fingers.\r\n\r\n"A kind of opaque enamel containing fusible material which is melted by\r\nheat and thereafter adheres to the surface of the glass. It must,\r\nhowever, be used carefully, as it possesses so much body that too much\r\nof it will obscure the light--the thing a stained glass window should\r\nnever do. We should have many more successful windows if the people\r\nmaking them would only bear in mind that a window is not a picture, and\r\nshould not be treated as one. For my part, I make my window a window. I\r\njoin the pieces of glass frankly together, not trying to conceal the\r\nlead that holds them. I cannot say that I get the results either with\r\ncolors or lights that I want to get; but I am trying, with the old\r\nmasters as my ideal."\r\n\r\n"Certainly you are a long way on the road if you can turn out a window\r\nas beautiful as this one promises to be. None of us reaches the ideal,\r\nMr. Norcross, but in the past is the inspiration that what man has done\r\nman can do. Perhaps not now, but in the future," Miss Cartright said\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n"I wish I might try stained glass making," Giusippe said again.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps some time you will, my boy," answered Mr. Norcross, "and\r\nperhaps, too, your generation may succeed where mine has failed, and\r\ngive to the world another Renaissance. Remember, all the great deeds\r\nhaven\'t been done yet."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTWO UNCLES AND A NEW HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Tom Curtis arrived in New York toward the end of the children\'s\r\nvisit, good-byes were said to Miss Cartright and to Uncle Bob, and\r\nwithin the space of a day Jean and Giusippe were amid new surroundings.\r\nHere was quite a different type of city from Boston--a city with many\r\nbeautiful buildings, fine residences, and a swarm of great factories\r\nwhich belched black smoke up into the blue of the sky. Here, too, were\r\nGiusippe\'s aunt and uncle with a hearty welcome for him; and here,\r\nfurthermore, was the new position which the boy had so eagerly craved\r\nin the glass works. The place given Giusippe, however, did not prove to\r\nbe the one his uncle had secured for him after all; for during the\r\njourney from New York Uncle Tom Curtis had had an opportunity to study\r\nthe young Italian, and the result of this better acquaintance turned\r\nout to be exactly what Uncle Bob Cabot had predicted; Uncle Tom became\r\ntremendously interested in the Venetian, and before they arrived at\r\nPittsburgh had decided to put him in quite a different part of the\r\nworks from that which he had at first intended.\r\n\r\n"Your nephew has splendid stuff in him," explained Mr. Curtis to\r\nGiusippe\'s uncle. "I mean to start him further up the ladder than most\r\nof the boys who come here. We will give him every chance to rise and\r\nwe\'ll see what use he makes of the opportunity. He is a very\r\ninteresting lad."\r\n\r\nAccordingly, while Jean struggled with French, algebra, drawing,\r\nhistory, and literature at the new school in which Uncle Tom had\r\nentered her and while she and Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Decker had many a combat with\r\nGerman, Giusippe began wrestling with the problems of plate glass\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nThe factory was an immense one, covering a vast area in the\r\nmanufacturing district of the city; it was a long way from the\r\nresidential section where Jean lived, and as the boy and girl had\r\nbecome great chums they at first missed each other very much. Soon,\r\nhowever, the rush of work filled in the gaps of loneliness. Each was\r\nfar too busy to lament the other, and since Uncle Tom invented all\r\nsorts of attractive plans whereby they could be together on Saturday\r\nafternoons and Sundays the weeks flew swiftly along. There were motor\r\ntrips, visits to the museums and churches of the city, and long walks\r\nwith Beacon wriggling to escape from the leash which reined him in.\r\n\r\nUncle Tom\'s home was much more formal than Uncle Bob\'s. It stood, one\r\nof a row of tall gray stone houses, fronting a broad avenue on which\r\nthere was a great deal of driving. It had a large library and a still\r\nlarger dining-room in which Jean playfully protested she knew she\r\nshould get lost. But stately as the dwelling was it was not so big and\r\nformidable after all if once you got upstairs; on the second floor were\r\nUncle Tom\'s rooms and a dainty little bedroom, study, and bath for\r\nJean. On the floor above a room was set apart for Giusippe, so that he\r\nmight stay at the house whenever he chose. Saturday nights and Sundays\r\nhe always spent at Uncle Tom\'s; the rest of the time he lived with his\r\nuncle and aunt.\r\n\r\nTo Giusippe it was good to be once more with his kin and talk in his\r\nnative language; and yet such a transformation had a few months in the\r\nUnited States made in him that he found that he was less and less\r\nanxious to remain an Italian and more and more eager to become an\r\nAmerican. His uncle, who had made but a poor success of life in Venice,\r\nand who had secured in his foster country prosperity and happiness,\r\ndeclared there was no land like it. He missed, it is true, the warm,\r\nrich beauty of his birthplace beyond the seas, and many a time talked\r\nof it to his wife and Giusippe; but the lure of the great throbbing\r\nAmerican city gripped him with its fascination. It presented endless\r\nopportunity--the chance to learn, to possess, to win out.\r\n\r\n"If you have brains and use them, if you are not afraid of hard work,\r\nthere is no limit to what a man may do and become over here," he told\r\nGiusippe. "That is why I like it, and why I never shall go back to\r\nItaly. Just you jump in, youngster, and don\'t you worry but you\'ll\r\nbring up somewhere in the end."\r\n\r\nThere was no need to urge a lad of Giusippe\'s make-up to "jump in"; on\r\nthe contrary it might, perhaps, have been wiser advice to caution him\r\nnot to take his new work too hard. He toiled early and late, never\r\nsparing himself, never thinking of fatigue. Physically he was a rugged\r\nboy, and to this power was linked the determination to make good.\r\nBefore he had been a month in the glass house he was recognized by all\r\nthe men as one who would make of each task merely a stepping-stone to\r\nsomething higher. His uncle was congratulated right and left on having\r\nsuch a nephew, and very proud indeed he was of Giusippe.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Uncle Tom Curtis, although apparently busy with more\r\nimportant matters, kept his eyes and ears open. Frequent reports\r\nconcerning his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 reached him in his far-away office at the other\r\nend of the works. Indeed the boy would have been not a little surprised\r\nhad he known how very well informed about his progress the head of the\r\nfirm really was. But Uncle Tom never said much. He did, however, write\r\nUncle Bob that to bring home a penniless Italian as a souvenir of\r\nVenice was not such a crazy scheme after all as he had at first\r\nsupposed it. From Uncle Tom this was rare praise, a complete\r\nvindication, in fact. Uncle Bob chuckled over the letter and showed it\r\nto Hannah, who rubbed her hands and declared things were working out\r\nnicely.\r\n\r\n"Some day, Giusippe," remarked Uncle Tom one evening after dinner, when\r\ntogether with the young people he was sitting within the crimson glow\r\nof the library lamp, "I propose you take Jean through the works. It is\r\nridiculous that a niece of mine should acquaint herself with the\r\nhistory of the glass of all the past ages and never go through her own\r\nuncle\'s factory. What do you say, missy? Would you like to go?"\r\n\r\n"Of course, Uncle Tom, I\'d love to. I wrote Uncle Bob only the other\r\nday that I wanted dreadfully to see how plate glass was made and hoped\r\nsome time you\'d take me. I didn\'t like to ask you for fear you were too\r\nbusy."\r\n\r\n"I have been a little rushed, I\'ll admit. We business men," he slapped\r\nGiusippe on the shoulder, "live in a good deal of a whirl--eh,\r\nGiusippe?"\r\n\r\n"I know you do, sir."\r\n\r\n"And you? You have nothing to do, I suppose. It chances that I have\r\nheard to the contrary, my lad. You\'ve put in some mighty good work\r\nsince you came here, and I am much gratified by the spirit you\'ve\r\nshown."\r\n\r\nGiusippe glowed. It was not a common thing for Mr. Curtis to commend.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know, sir, that you----"\r\n\r\n"Knew what you were doing? Didn\'t any one ever tell you that I have a\r\nsearch-light and a telescope in my office?" Uncle Tom laughed. "Oh, I\r\nkeep track of things even if I do seem to be otherwise occupied. So\r\nlook out for yourself! Beware! My eyes may be upon you almost any\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"I am not afraid, sir," smiled the boy.\r\n\r\n"And you have no cause to be, either, my lad," was Uncle Tom\'s serious\r\nrejoinder. "Now you and Jean fix up some date to see the works. Why not\r\nto-morrow? It is Saturday, and she will not be at school."\r\n\r\n"But I work Saturday mornings, Mr. Curtis."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t somebody else do your work for you?"\r\n\r\n"I have never asked that."\r\n\r\n"Well, I will. We\'ll arrange it. Let us say to-morrow then. Take Jean\r\nand explain things to her. You can do it, can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I think so. Most of the process I understand now, and if there is\r\nanything that I need help about I can ask."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. Just go ahead and complete the girl\'s education in\r\nglass-making so she can write her Boston uncle that she is now\r\nqualified to superintend any glass works that may require her\r\noversight."\r\n\r\nJean laughed merrily.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I should be rather a poor superintendent, Uncle Tom," said\r\nshe. "There seems to be such a lot to know about glass."\r\n\r\n"There is," agreed Mr. Curtis. "Sometimes I feel as if about everything\r\nin the world was made of it. Of course you\'ve seen the ink erasers made\r\nof a cluster of fine glass fibres. Oh, yes; they have them. And the\r\naigrettes made in the same way and used in ladies\' bonnets. Then there\r\nare those beautiful brocades having fine threads of spun glass woven\r\ninto them in place of gold and silver; it was a Toledo firm, by the\r\nway, that presented to the Infanta Eulalie of Spain a dress of satin\r\nand glass woven together. To-day came an order from California for\r\nglass to serve yet another purpose; you could never guess what. The\r\npeople out there want some of our heaviest polished plate to make the\r\nbottoms of boats."\r\n\r\n"Of boats!"\r\n\r\n"Boats," repeated Uncle Tom, nodding.\r\n\r\n"But--but why make a glass-bottomed boat?"\r\n\r\n"Well, in California, Florida, and many other warm climates boats with\r\nbottoms of glass are much in use. Sightseers go out to where the water\r\nis clear and by looking down through the transparent bottom of the boat\r\nthey can see, as they go along, the wonderful plant and animal life of\r\nthe ocean. Such reptiles, such fish, such seaweeds as there are! I have\r\nheard that it is as interesting as moving pictures, and quite as\r\nthrilling, too."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to do it," said Giusippe.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t," declared Jean with a shudder. "I hate things that\r\nwrithe, and squirm, and wriggle. Imagine being so near those hideous\r\ncreatures! Why, if I once should see them I should never dare to go in\r\nbathing again. I\'d rather not know what\'s in the sea."\r\n\r\n"There is something in that, little lady," Uncle Tom answered, slipping\r\none of his big hands over the two tiny ones in the girl\'s lap.\r\n"Giusippe and I will keep the sea monsters out of your path, then; and\r\nthe land monsters, too, if we can. Now it is time you children got to\r\nbed, for to-morrow you must make an early start. You\'d better telephone\r\nyour aunt or uncle that you are going to stay here to-night, Giusippe.\r\nIf you do not work to-morrow you will not need to get to the factory\r\nuntil Jean and I do; it will be much simpler for you to remain here and\r\ngo down with us in the car. I\'ll call up your boss and explain matters.\r\nGood-night, both of you. Now scamper! I want to read my paper."\r\n\r\n                     *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Curtis family was promptly astir, and after\r\nbreakfast Uncle Tom with his two charges rolled off to the factory in\r\nthe big red limousine.\r\n\r\n"Your superintendent says you are welcome to the morning off,\r\nGiusippe," Mr. Curtis remarked as they sped along. "But he did have the\r\ngrace to say he should miss you. Now it seems to me that if you are to\r\ngive Jean a clear idea of what we do at the works you better begin with\r\nthe sheet glass department. That will interest her, I am sure; later\r\nyou can show her where you yourself work."\r\n\r\nThe car pulled up at Mr. Curtis\'s office, and they all got out.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye! Good luck to you," he called as the boy and girl started\r\noff.\r\n\r\nJean waved her hand.\r\n\r\n"We will be back here and ready to go home with you, Uncle Tom, at one\r\no\'clock," she called over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n"We won\'t be late, sir."\r\n\r\n"See that you\'re not. I shall be hungry and shall not want to wait. I\r\nguess you\'ll have an appetite, too, by that time."\r\n\r\n"Is sheet glass blown, Giusippe?" inquired Jean, as they went across\r\nthe yard. "I hate to ask stupid questions, but you see I do not know\r\nanything about it."\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t a stupid question. Quite the contrary. Yes, sheet glass is\r\nblown. You shall see it done, too."\r\n\r\n"But I do not understand how they can get it flattened out, if they\r\nblow it."\r\n\r\n"You will."\r\n\r\nThe boy led the way through a low arched door.\r\n\r\nBefore the furnaces within the great room a number of glass-blowers\r\nwere at work. They stood upon wooden stagings, each one of which was\r\nbuilt over a well or pit in the floor, and was just opposite an opening\r\nin the furnace.\r\n\r\n"Each of these men has a work-hole of the furnace to himself, so that\r\nhe may heat his material any time he needs to do so. The staging gives\r\nhim room to swing his heavy mass of glass as he blows it, and the pit\r\nin the floor, which is about ten feet deep, furnishes space for the big\r\ncylinder to run out, or grow longer, as he blows. The gathering for\r\nsheet glass is done much as was that for the smaller pieces. The\r\ngatherer collects a lump on his pipe, cools it a little, and collects\r\nmore until he has enough. He then rests it on one of those wooden\r\nblocks such as you see over there; the block is hollowed out so to let\r\nthe blower expand the glass to the diameter he wants it."\r\n\r\n"But I should think the block would burn when the hot glass is forced\r\ninside it."\r\n\r\n"It would if it were not first sprinkled with water. Sometimes hollow\r\nmetal blocks are used instead. In that case water passes through to\r\nkeep them cool, and they are dusted over with charcoal to keep them\r\nfrom sticking, and from scratching the glass. After a sufficiently\r\nlarge mass of glass has been gathered and reheated to a workable\r\ncondition the blower begins his task. First he swings the great red-hot\r\nlump about so that it will get longer. His aim is to make a long\r\ncylinder and into it he must blow constantly in order to keep it full\r\nof air. Watch that man now at work. See how deft he is, and how strong.\r\nThe even thickness of the glass, and the uniformity of its size, depend\r\nentirely upon his skill. If he finds the cylinder running out too fast,\r\nor in other words getting too long, he shifts it up over his head,\r\nalways taking care, however, to keep it upright."\r\n\r\nJean watched.\r\n\r\nHow rapidly the man worked with the great mass on his blow-pipe! Now he\r\nblew it far down into the pit beneath, where it hung like a mighty,\r\nelongated soap-bubble; now he swung it to and fro; now lifted it above\r\nhis head. And all the time he was blowing into it blasts of air from\r\nhis powerful lungs.\r\n\r\n"The cylinder doesn\'t seem to get any bigger round," observed Jean at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n"No. Its diameter was fixed at the beginning by the wooden block. That\r\nsettles its size once and for all; it is the length and thickness of\r\nthe cylinder which are governed by the blower. Do you realize how\r\nstrong a man has to be to wield such a weight as that lump of metal? It\r\nis no easy matter. Luckily he can suspend it against that wooden rest\r\nif he gets too tired. In England they use a sort of iron frame called\r\nan _Iron Man_ to relieve the blower of the weight of the glass and\r\nthe device was also used at one time in Belgium; but the Belgian\r\nworkmen gradually did away with it."\r\n\r\nFor a long time the two children stood there fascinated by the skill of\r\nthe blowers.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we go on now and see the rest of the process," suggested\r\nGiusippe, a little unwillingly. "I could watch these men all day, but\r\nwe have much to do, and if we do not hurry we shall not get through."\r\n\r\nThe next step in the work was opening out the cylinders, and this was\r\ndone in two ways. The end of those made of thinner glass was put into\r\nthe furnace while at the same time air was forced inside through the\r\nblow-pipe. As a result the air expanded by the heat of the fire, and\r\nburst open the cylinder at its hottest or weakest end. By placing this\r\nopening downward it was widened to the diameter necessary. The\r\ncylinders of thicker glass were opened by fastening to one end a lump\r\nof hot metal, thereby weakening them at this point. When the air was\r\nforced in by the blower it burst open the mass and the break thus made\r\nwas enlarged by cutting it round with the scissors.\r\n\r\n"Now come on, Jean, and see them flatten it out," said Giusippe.\r\n\r\nUpon a wooden rest or chevalet the cylinder was now laid and detached\r\nfrom the pipe by placing a bit of cold steel against the part of the\r\nglass that still clung to the blow-pipe. At once the neck of the glass,\r\nwhich was hot, contracted at the touch of the cold metal and broke away\r\nfrom the pipe. The small end was then taken off by winding round it a\r\nthread of hot glass, and afterward applying cold iron or steel at any\r\npoint the thread had covered.\r\n\r\n"The cylinder is now finished at top and bottom and is ready to be\r\nsplit up the side," said Giusippe. "This they do with a rule and a\r\ndiamond point mounted in a long handle. The diamond point is drawn\r\nalong the inside of the cylinder and opens it out flat. If there are\r\nany imperfections in the glass the cutter plans to have them come as\r\nnear the edge of this opening as possible so there will be little\r\nwaste."\r\n\r\nJean nodded.\r\n\r\n"Now, as you will see, the glass is ready for the flattener. First he\r\nwarms it in the flue of his furnace and then, using his croppie or\r\niron, he puts it on the flattening-stone; if you look carefully you\r\nwill see that the top of this stone is covered with a large sheet of\r\nglass. In the heat of the furnace the cylinder with the split uppermost\r\nsoon opens out and falls back in a wavy mass. See?"\r\n\r\nJean watched intently as the great roll of glass unfolded and spread\r\ninto billows. The moment it was fairly open the flattener took his\r\npolissoir, a rod of iron with a block of wood at one end, and began\r\nsmoothing out the uneven sheet of glass into a flat surface. At times\r\nhe had to rub it with all his strength to straighten it. This done the\r\nflattening-stone was moved on wheels to a cooler part of the furnace\r\nand the sheet of glass upon it was transferred to a cooling-stone. When\r\nstiff enough it was taken off and placed either flat or on edge in a\r\nrack with other sheets.\r\n\r\nSo the process went on.\r\n\r\nCylinder after cylinder was blown, opened up, flattened, and annealed.\r\nSo quickly did the single sheets of glass cool that it was not much\r\nmore than half an hour from the time they entered the flattening kiln\r\nbefore they came out thoroughly annealed. They were then carried to the\r\nwarehouse for inspection and the especially fine ones were selected to\r\nbe polished into patent glass. The sheets were rated as bests, seconds,\r\nthirds, and fourths, and their average size was 48 x 34 or 36 inches,\r\nalthough the foreman said that sometimes sheets as large as 82 x 42 or\r\n75 x 50 had been made. These, however, were exceedingly difficult to\r\nhandle, as they were in constant danger of being broken. The mass of\r\nglass was also very heavy for the blower to wield.\r\n\r\n"The great advantage of sheet glass over crown glass is that it can be\r\nmade in large pieces. Of course it is not as brilliant as crown, but it\r\nis much more useful," added the workman.\r\n\r\n"What is crown glass?" whispered Jean to Giusippe.\r\n\r\n"It is a variety of glass manufactured by another process," was the\r\nreply. "We do not make it here. Do you remember the bull\'s eye glass\r\nwindows we saw in England? Well, each of those bull\'s eyes came from\r\nthe center of a sheet of crown glass just where a lump of hot glass was\r\nattached so the blower could whirl or spin it from the middle and make\r\nit into a flat disc. But, as you can readily understand, a sheet of\r\nglass with this mark or defect right in the center will never cut to\r\nadvantage, and therefore only comparatively small pieces can be got out\r\nof it; there is much waste. Yet, as the man says, it has a wonderfully\r\nbrilliant surface. Now I am not going to let you stay here any longer\r\nor we shall not have time to see the part of the factory where I am\r\nworking. I\'m in the plate glass department, and I intend to drag you\r\noff to the casting hall this very moment."\r\n\r\nJean laughed.\r\n\r\n"Before you go, though, you must understand that plate glass is quite a\r\ndifferent thing from these others. It is not blown at all. Instead the\r\nmelt is poured out on an iron table just as molasses candy is turned\r\nout of a pan to cool. You\'ll see how it is done."\r\n\r\nThey crossed the yard and entered another part of the works; Giusippe\r\ngave the foreman a word of greeting as they went in.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the great room were the annealing ovens, and down the\r\ncenter of the hall on a track moved a casting table which rolled along\r\non wheels. The pots of molten glass or metal were first taken from the\r\nfurnaces and carried on trucks to this casting table. Here they were\r\nlifted by a crane, suspended above the table, and then tilted over, and\r\nthe glass poured out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THE MELT IS POURED OUT ON AN IRON TABLE"]\r\n\r\n"For all the world like a pan of fudge!" declared Jean.\r\n\r\nGiusippe laughed.\r\n\r\n"I guess you would find it the stickiest, heaviest fudge you ever tried\r\nto manage," said he.\r\n\r\nThe instant the mass of soft metal was on the table a roller of\r\ncast-iron was passed very swiftly back and forth over it, spreading it\r\nto uniform thickness, and at the same time flattening it.\r\n\r\n"The thickness of the glass is gauged by the strips of iron on which\r\nthe roller moves," explained Giusippe to Jean. "These can be adjusted\r\nto any thickness. Notice how rapidly the men have to work. The glass\r\nmust be finished while it is hot, or there will be flaws in it. It is a\r\nrushing job, I can tell you."\r\n\r\n"But--but you don\'t call this stuff plate glass, do you?" inquired the\r\ngirl in dismay. "It does not look like it--at least not like any I ever\r\nsaw used as shop windows or for mirrors."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is not done yet. But it is what we call rough plate. That\'s the\r\nkind that is used where light and not transparency is needed. You often\r\nsee it in office doors or in skylights of buildings. To get the\r\nbeautiful polished plate glass that you are talking about this rough\r\nplate must be polished over and over again. But before it can be\r\npolished it must first be annealed as rough plate. It goes into the\r\nannealing ovens right from this table and comes out all irregular--full\r\nof pits and imperfections. No matter how flat the casting table is, or\r\nhow much care is taken, the surface of the glass after annealing is\r\nalways bad. If it is to be made into polished plate it must be ground\r\ndown first with sand and water; then ground smoother still with a\r\ncoarse kind of emery stone and water; next ground again with water and\r\npowdered emery stone. After that comes the smoothing process done with\r\na finer sort of emery and water. Last of all the sheet is bedded, as we\r\ncall it, and each side is polished with rouge, or red oxide, between\r\nmoving pads of felt."\r\n\r\n"Goodness!" ejaculated Jean. "Do you mean to say they have to go\r\nthrough all that with every sheet of plate glass?"\r\n\r\n"Every sheet of _polished_ plate," corrected Giusippe. "Rough plate\r\ndoes not need to be polished or ground down much. It is made merely for\r\nuse and not for beauty. Sometimes to add strength, and help support the\r\nweight of large sheets, wire netting is embedded in them. Wired glass\r\nlike this was the invention of an American named Schuman and it is used\r\na great deal; the wire not only relieves the weight of the glass but\r\nserves the double purpose of holding the pieces should any break off\r\nand start to fall. Often, too, insurance companies specify that it\r\nshall be used as a matter of fire protection."\r\n\r\n"But I should think if plate glass--I mean polished plate," Jean\r\nhurriedly corrected her error, "has to be ground down so much there\r\nwouldn\'t be anything left of it. It must come out dreadfully thin."\r\n\r\n"The casters have to consider that and allow for it," answered the\r\nItalian. "They expect part of the glass will have to be ground away, so\r\nthey cast it thicker in the first place. A large, perfect sheet of\r\npolished plate is quite an achievement. From beginning to end it\r\nrequires the greatest care, and if spoiled it is a big loss not only in\r\nactual labor but because of the amount of material required to make it.\r\nEven at the very last it may be injured in the warehouse either by\r\nscratching or breaking. It is there that it is cut in the size pieces\r\ndesired."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"With a rule and diamond point just such as is used for cutting sheet\r\nglass. The surface is scratched to give the line of fracture and then\r\nit is split evenly."\r\n\r\n"I should hate to have the responsibility of cutting or handling it\r\nwhen it is all done," Jean observed with a little shiver.\r\n\r\n"Well you might. Only men of the greatest skill and experience are\r\nallowed to touch the big, heavy sheets. The risk is too great. They\r\nturn only the best workmen into the plate glass department."\r\n\r\n"But you work here, don\'t you, Giusippe?"\r\n\r\n"I? Oh, I--I\'m just learning," was the boy\'s modest reply.\r\n\r\n"You seem to have learned pretty well," said a voice at his elbow.\r\n\r\nTurning the lad was astonished to find Mr. Curtis standing just behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"I must own up to being an eavesdropper," laughed the older man. "I\r\ncouldn\'t resist knowing whether you were instructing Jean as she should\r\nbe instructed, Giusippe. Don\'t worry. I have no fault to find. I\r\ncouldn\'t have explained it better myself. You shall have your diploma\r\non plate glass making any time you want it."\r\n\r\nThen as the superintendent advanced to speak to him, Mr. Curtis added:\r\n\r\n"You had given your pupil a good bringing up, Mr. Hines. He does you\r\ncredit."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nJEAN\'S TELEGRAM AND WHAT IT SAID\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter in Pittsburgh passed rapidly. For Jean it was a happy year\r\ndespite much hard work at school, German lessons with Fr\xc3\xa4ulein, and\r\nlong hours of piano practising. It seemed as if the scales and finger\r\nexercises were endless and sometimes the girl wondered which had the\r\nmore miserable fate--she who was forced to drum the same old things\r\nover and over, or poor Uncle Tom who had to listen when she was doing\r\nit. And yet as she looked back over her busy days she realized that she\r\nneither studied nor practised all the time. No, there was many a good\r\ntime interspersed in her routine. For example, there was the\r\nShakespeare play at the school, a performance of "As You Like It," in\r\nwhich Jean herself took the part of "Rosalind." This was an excitement\r\nindeed! Uncle Tom became so interested that he got out his book and\r\nspent several evenings coaching the leading lady, as he called the\r\ngirl; one night he even went so far as to impersonate "Orlando," and he\r\nand Jean gave a dress rehearsal in the library, greatly to Giusippe\'s\r\ndelight and amusement. This set them all to reading Shakespeare aloud,\r\nand going to a number of presentations of the dramas then being given\r\nin the city. To the young people all this was new and wonderful, for up\r\nto the present they had been little to the theater.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Giusippe was also having his struggles. It was a\r\nrushing season at the factory, there being many large orders to fill;\r\nthe mill hummed night and day and in consequence the scores of\r\nglass-makers looked happy and prosperous. No one was out of employment\r\nor on half pay, and none of the workmen dreaded Christmas because there\r\nwas nothing to put in the kiddies\' stockings.\r\n\r\nWith Christmas came Uncle Bob and oh, what a holiday there was then!\r\nWas ever a Christmas tree so beautiful, or a Christmas dinner so\r\ndelicious? Giusippe brought his aunt and uncle to the great house, and\r\nin the evening there was a dance for Jean and some of her school\r\nfriends. Uncle Bob, who was in the gayest of spirits, danced with all\r\nthe girls; introduced everybody to everybody; and brought heaping\r\nplates of salad to the dancers. There seemed to be nothing he could not\r\ndo from putting up Christmas greens to playing the piano until the\r\nbelated musicians arrived. The party could never had been given without\r\nhim, that was certain. It was a Christmas long to be remembered!\r\n\r\nAnd when he left the next morning it was with the understanding that\r\nJean should return to Boston the first of May. Uncle Tom looked pretty\r\ngrave when he was reminded that the days of his niece\'s stay with him\r\nwere numbered; and it was amusing to hear him use the very arguments\r\nthat Uncle Bob had voiced when Jean had left Boston for Pittsburgh\r\nmonths before.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t as if the child was never coming back," he told Giusippe.\r\n"Her home is here; she is only going to Boston for her vacation. We\r\nshould be selfish indeed to grudge her a few weeks at the seashore.\r\nPittsburgh is rather warm in summer."\r\n\r\nThus Uncle Tom consoled himself, and as the days flew past tried to put\r\nout of his mind the inevitable day of parting.\r\n\r\nThen came May and with it a very unexpected happening. Jean\'s trunk was\r\npacked, and she was all ready to leave for the East, when Uncle Tom was\r\ntaken sick.\r\n\r\n"I doubt if it is anything but overwork and fatigue," said the doctor.\r\n"Mr. Curtis has, I find, been carrying a great deal of care this\r\nwinter. It is good to do a rushing business, of course, but when one\r\nhas to rush along with it the wear and tear on the nerves is pretty\r\nsevere."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think he will be ill long, do you?" questioned Jean\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell. Such cases are uncertain. He just needs rest--to give\r\nup work for a while and stay at home. Recreation, diversion,\r\namusement--that\'s what he wants. Read to him; motor with him; walk with\r\nhim; keep him entertained. Things like that will do far more good than\r\nmedicine."\r\n\r\n"But--but--I\'m--I\'m going away to-morrow for the rest of the summer,"\r\nstammered Jean.\r\n\r\n"Away? Humph! That\'s unfortunate."\r\n\r\n"Why, you don\'t really think I am any use here, do you? Enough use to\r\nremain, I mean," the girl inquired in surprise. "Uncle Tom doesn\'t--you\r\ndon\'t mean that he _needs_ me; that I could do good by staying?"\r\n\r\nA flush overspread her face. That any one should need her! And most of\r\nall such a big strong man as Uncle Tom. The idea was unbelievable.\r\nHitherto life had been a matter of what others should do for her. She\r\nhad been a child with no obligations save to do as she was told. Her\r\ntwo uncles whom she loved so much had discussed her fate and decided\r\nbetween them what her course should be. Now, all at once, there was no\r\npilot at the wheel. The directing of the ship fell to her guidance. In\r\nthe space of those few moments, as if by a miracle, Jean Cabot ceased\r\nto be a child and became a woman.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Curtis is very fond of you, isn\'t he?" asked the physician. "He\r\nwill miss you if you are not here, I am afraid. Who else is there in\r\nthe house to be a companion for him?"\r\n\r\n"No one but Fr\xc3\xa4ulein, and of course she is getting older and is not\r\nvery strong."\r\n\r\n"Unfortunate!" repeated the doctor.\r\n\r\n"It is not at all necessary for me to go to-morrow," Jean said quickly.\r\n"I can postpone it and stay here just as well as not, and I think it\r\nwould be much better if I did." She spoke with deepening conviction.\r\n"I\'ll telegraph my uncle in Boston and explain to him that I cannot\r\nleave just now."\r\n\r\nWhat a deal of dignity stole into that single word "cannot."\r\n\r\nAt last there was a duty to fulfil toward some one else--some one who\r\nreally needed her. Jean repeated the amazing fact over and over to\r\nherself. She had a place to fill. She and Uncle Tom had reversed their\r\nobligations; he was now the weak one, she the strong.\r\n\r\nWith a happy heart the girl went back up-stairs.\r\n\r\nUncle Tom was lying very still in bed, his face turned away from the\r\ndoor; but he heard her light step and put out his hand.\r\n\r\n"My little girl," he whispered.\r\n\r\nJean slipped her soft palm into his.\r\n\r\n"Did I wake you?"\r\n\r\n"No, dear. I was not asleep. I cannot sleep these days. Last night I\r\nheard the clock strike almost every hour. It has been so right along. I\r\ncannot recall when I have had a full night\'s rest. No sooner do I go to\r\nbed than my mind travels like a whirlwind over everything I\'ve done\r\nthrough the day. There is no peace, no stopping it."\r\n\r\n"We will stop it, dear. Don\'t worry, Uncle Tom. The doctor says you are\r\njust a little tired, and he is going to give you some medicine that\r\nwill help you to feel better. Then you are to stay at home and rest for\r\na while. To-morrow you shall have your breakfast in bed and later, when\r\nit is sunny and warm, I shall take you for a nice motor ride."\r\n\r\n"But--but you forget, girlie, that to-morrow you won\'t be here."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes I shall. I\'m going to stay. There is no law against my\r\nchanging my mind and not going to Boston, is there?"\r\n\r\nJean smiled down at him.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve wired Uncle Bob that I am going to postpone my visit," she added.\r\n\r\nA light came into the man\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"Did the doctor----?"\r\n\r\n"No, he didn\'t. I decided it myself. Do you suppose for a moment I\'d\r\nleave you just when you are going to be here at home and have some time\r\nto entertain me? Indeed, no! Lately you\'ve been so busy that you\r\ncouldn\'t take me anywhere. Now you are to desert the office and be\r\nunder my orders for a while. Oh, we\'ll do lots of nice things. We\'ll go\r\noff in the motor and see all sorts of places I\'ve wanted to see; and\r\nwe\'ll walk; and we\'ll read some of those books we have been trying to\r\nget time to read together. We shall have great fun."\r\n\r\nMr. Curtis looked keenly at the girl for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," he remarked at last, "it won\'t make much difference to Uncle\r\nBob if you do postpone your visit for a week or two."\r\n\r\n"I am sure it won\'t."\r\n\r\nThere was a deep sigh of satisfaction from the invalid.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you\'ve decided to stay, little girl. Somehow it would be\r\nabout the last straw to have you leave now. I\'d miss you in any case,\r\nof course; but if I have got to be home here and round the house it\r\ndoes not seem as if I could stand it to have you gone."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t think of going and leaving you, dear. Put your mind at\r\nrest. I intend to stay right here until you are quite well again."\r\n\r\nShe bent down and gently kissed her uncle\'s forehead.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if that kiss smoothed every wrinkle of worry from the\r\nman\'s brow.\r\n\r\nQuietly Jean tiptoed across the room and drew down the shade; then she\r\ndropped into a chair beside the bed and took up a book. For some time\r\nshe sat very still, her eyes intent upon the page. Then at last she\r\nglanced up. Uncle Tom\'s head had fallen back on the pillows and for the\r\nfirst time in many days he slept.\r\n\r\n                     *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nSo did Jean Cabot find her summer planned for her. Instead of joining\r\nUncle Bob and enjoying months of bathing and sailing on the North Shore\r\nshe helped nurse Uncle Tom Curtis back to health. For the breakdown\r\nproved to be of much longer duration than any of them had foreseen. The\r\nexhausted system was slow in reacting and it was weeks before the\r\nturning point toward recovery was reached. During those tedious hours\r\nof waiting Jean was the sole person who could bring a smile to the sick\r\nman\'s face or rouse in him a shadow of interest in what was going on\r\nabout him. "Her price was above rubies," the doctor said. She was\r\nbetter than sunshine or fresh air; she was, in fact, the only hope of\r\nbringing the invalid back to his normal self.\r\n\r\nAnd when those grim days passed and Uncle Tom began to be better, how\r\nhe clung to the girl--clung to her with an affection which neither of\r\nthem had felt before. It was the realization of his dependence that\r\nmade Jean send to Uncle Bob that letter, the last lines of which read:\r\n\r\n    "I feel more strongly than I can tell you, dear Uncle Bob, that\r\n    for the present my place is here. Uncle Tom needs me and cannot do\r\n    without me. You have Hannah to help you keep house and you can get\r\n    on; but he has nobody but me. When he is quite strong again I will\r\n    come to Boston, but until I do I am sure you\'ll understand that\r\n    although I cannot be with you, I love you just the same.\r\n\r\n    "Jean."\r\n\r\nA reply came back by wire.\r\n\r\n"Goodness!" exclaimed Jean as she opened the long telegram. "I hope\r\nnothing is the matter. Uncle Bob never sends telegrams. He must have\r\nbeen reckless to spend his money on such a long message as this."\r\n\r\n    "You are doing just right. Stay as long as needed, but remember\r\n    Boston home waits whenever you wish to come. Hannah has proved\r\n    inadequate housekeeper. Have new one. Miss Cartright and I were\r\n    married in New York to-day.\r\n\r\n    "Uncle Bob."\r\n\r\nJean\'s reading stopped with a jerk. She was speechless. So great was\r\nher joy, her surprise, that not a word would come to her tongue.\r\n\r\nThen Uncle Tom remarked dryly:\r\n\r\n"I guess your Uncle Bob was a bit reckless about the time he sent that\r\nwire. The only wonder is the telegram wasn\'t twice as long."\r\n\r\nGiusippe was the next to find his voice.\r\n\r\n"Well!" he ejaculated. "And we never even dreamed it! At last, Jean,\r\nyou\'ve got your wish. Your good fairy has given you an _aunt_!"\r\n\r\n"And such an aunt!" Jean added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nJEAN AND GIUSIPPE EACH FIND A NICHE IN LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring Uncle Tom\'s illness and slow recovery Giusippe became the\r\nmessenger between Mr. Curtis\'s residence and his office. It was,\r\nhowever, weeks before there was any link connecting the two. But as\r\nhealth returned there came to the invalid a gradual revival of interest\r\nin affairs at the glass works. Nevertheless the doctor was a cautious\r\nman and at first permitted only the slightest allusions to be made to\r\nbusiness. Later, as strength increased, Mr. Curtis was allowed to look\r\nover at home mail, papers, and specifications and put his signature to\r\na few important documents, and since Giusippe was almost constantly at\r\nthe house what was more natural than that he should become the\r\ngo-between? Mr. Curtis dropped into explaining to the boy from time to\r\ntime many confidential matters and directing him as to what he wished\r\ndone regarding them. The young Italian, as his employer soon found, was\r\nquick to grasp a situation and could be relied upon to fulfil\r\ninstructions to the letter and without blundering. Such a person was of\r\ninestimable value during those days of convalescence.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that Giusippe spent less and less of his time in his\r\nown department in the glass works and more and more in Mr. Curtis\'s\r\nprivate office. Before long, boy though he was, he had quite a complete\r\ncomprehension of the older man\'s affairs and proved himself most useful\r\nto the head of the firm who was fighting his way back to health. It was\r\nso easy to say:\r\n\r\n"Regarding this letter, I wish, Giusippe, you would see that such and\r\nsuch a reply is sent. Look it over yourself before it goes out to be\r\nsure that the stenographer has correctly caught my idea."\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n"Go and tell Levin of the sheet glass department that I want these\r\norders filled before any others are shipped. Attend to it yourself,\r\nand make certain he clearly understands."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I WANT THESE ORDERS FILLED"]\r\n\r\nTo drop any portion of the detail of his mighty business upon younger\r\nshoulders, or in fact upon any shoulders at all was a thing which, but\r\na short time before, Mr. Curtis would have considered impossible. But\r\nnow, to his surprise, he found himself actually doing it to an amazing\r\nextent, and discovered that no calamity resulted in consequence. On the\r\ncontrary it was a positive relief to have a bright, strong, eager boy\r\nlift a part of the burden which had become so heavy for the older man\r\nto bear alone. For Giusippe possessed that rare gift seldom found in\r\nthe young and often lacking, even, in elder persons--he could hold his\r\ntongue. He never prattled of Mr. Curtis\'s affairs; never boasted of his\r\nknowledge of the innermost workings of the firm. He did as he was told,\r\ngave his opinion when asked, and kept whatever information was doled\r\nout to him entirely to himself.\r\n\r\nHence it followed naturally that when Uncle Tom began going to the\r\nworks for a few hours each day he took Giusippe with him, and when he\r\ncame home left the boy to see carried out the instructions he gave.\r\nSlowly the office force began to defer to the youthful Italian.\r\n\r\n"Did Mr. Curtis say anything about this matter or that?"\r\n\r\n"Was such and such a price the one Mr. Curtis wished quoted?"\r\n\r\nHaving discussed many of these very matters with his employer Giusippe\r\nwas usually ready with an answer or he could get one. For it was he\r\nalone who was sure to receive a telephone reply from the Curtis\r\nresidence; he was the only one who knew at just what time of day Mr.\r\nCurtis could be reached, and whether he was well enough that morning to\r\nbe disturbed. Men desiring interviews with the head of the firm soon\r\nfound themselves inquiring for Mr. Cicone and asking him if possible to\r\narrange things so they could have a few words with Mr. Curtis. Giusippe\r\nwas the recognized buffer, the go-between who guarded the capitalist\r\nfrom annoyance and intrusion of every sort.\r\n\r\n"You talk with this fellow, Giusippe," Mr. Curtis would often say.\r\n"Tell him--well, you know--get him out of the office. You can do it\r\npolitely. Tell him I\'ll give him a hundred dollars toward his hospital,\r\nbut keep him out of my way."\r\n\r\nThen Giusippe would laugh.\r\n\r\nHe had begun to understand that the life of a rich man was no easy one.\r\n\r\nScores of persons came to see Mr. Curtis: persons applying for business\r\npositions; persons begging money for various good causes; customers;\r\nsalesmen; men wanting newspaper interviews. From morning until night\r\nthe throng filed in and out of the office. Up to the present Mr. Curtis\r\nhad been content to remain in the security of his inner domain and rely\r\non his stenographer to fill many of the gaps. But with illness a change\r\nhad come and it was to Giusippe that most of these duties fell.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, strangely enough, nothing had been further from the older\r\nman\'s original plan than to transform this foreign-born lad into his\r\nprivate secretary. But so it came about.\r\n\r\n"I seem to just need you all the time, Giusippe," he declared one day.\r\n"When you leave the house and return to your uncle\'s I am always\r\ndiscovering something I meant to ask you and having to send the car\r\nafter you; and the moment you go back to your own job in the casting\r\ndepartment, without fail some matter comes up and you have to be\r\ntelephoned for. It is no use to try to get on without you. I need you\r\nall the time. I need you here at home and I need you at the office."\r\n\r\nGiusippe smiled.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad if I can be of help to you, sir."\r\n\r\n"You are of help; you are more than that--you are---- See here, what do\r\nyou say to throwing up your position at the works and coming into my\r\nprivate office as my--well, as my general utility man? I\'ve never had a\r\nsecretary--I\'ve never wanted one; and if I had I never before have seen\r\nthe chap I\'d trust with the job. But you are different. You\'re one of\r\nthe family, to begin with. Moreover, you\'ve proved that you can be\r\ntrusted, and that you have some common sense. What would you take to\r\nmove into your room up-stairs for good and all, and live here where I\r\ncan get hold of you when I want you? Are you so wedded to your aunt and\r\nuncle or to your work in the factory that you would be unwilling to\r\nmake the change?"\r\n\r\nA flush suffused the boy\'s face.\r\n\r\n"If you really think that I could do for you what you want done, Mr.\r\nCurtis----"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think, I know!"\r\n\r\n"Then I\'d like to come, sir."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right! It will be a weight off my mind. The doctor says that\r\nfor some months I must still go easy. You can save both my time and my\r\nstrength. I like you and I believe you like me; that is half the battle\r\nin working with any one. We will send to your uncle\'s for your trunk\r\nand whatever else you have."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t much else but some books," answered Giusippe. "I have been\r\nbuying a few from time to time as I could afford them."\r\n\r\n"Box them up and send them over. Send everything. This is to be your\r\nfuture home, you understand. And by the by, we\'ll give you that other\r\nroom adjoining your bedroom. You will need a bit more space. I will\r\nhave a desk and some book-shelves put in there."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll call that settled, then. It is going to be very helpful to have\r\nyou right here on the spot. It is the person who aims to be of service\r\nwho is really valuable in the world. Look at Jean. In her way she has\r\nbeen doing the same thing that you have. When she found I was in a hole\r\nand needed her she gave up her vacation in the East without a murmur. I\r\nsha\'n\'t forget it, either. Come in, missy. I\'m talking about you."\r\n\r\nJean, who had paused on the threshold of the room, entered smiling.\r\n\r\n"You caught me at just the right moment, little lady. I was slandering\r\nyou," went on Mr. Curtis. "I was saying to Giusippe that I never again\r\ncan get on without you two young persons. Why, this old house was quiet\r\nas the grave before you came into it. I cannot imagine how I ever\r\nexisted here alone all these years. The piano wasn\'t opened from one\r\nend of the year to the other, and when I unlocked the door and came in\r\nthere wasn\'t a single sound anywhere. As I look back on it I guess I\r\nspent about all my time at the Club. But since you came it has been\r\ndifferent. I\'ve liked it a whole lot better, too. Now I feel as if I\r\nreally had a home."\r\n\r\nJean bent down and kissed him.\r\n\r\n"When I get older," she said, "I mean that you shall have even a nicer\r\nhome. Fr\xc3\xa4ulein will be an old lady soon, Uncle Tom, and will not be\r\nable to take care of things as she does now. Then I\'m going to ask her\r\nto teach me to market and to keep house. If you are to make Giusippe\r\nyour secretary it is only fair that you should give me a position, too.\r\nI\'ll be your housekeeper. You\'ll see what a good one I shall make after\r\nI\'ve learned how. I should love to do it. A girl--a really, truly girl,\r\nUncle Tom, can\'t help wanting to keep house for somebody."\r\n\r\n"No more she can, dear, and she ought to want to, too. It is her work\r\nin the world to be a homemaker--the one who touches with comfort and\r\nwith beauty the lives of those about her. You shall be housekeeper for\r\nGiusippe and me, little girl, and shall make out of these four walls a\r\nreal home. That is what your new Aunt Ethel is to do for your Uncle\r\nBob."\r\n\r\n"I know it," answered Jean softly. "Even Uncle Bob couldn\'t get on\r\nwithout some one to look after him, could he?"\r\n\r\n"No," answered Mr. Curtis, "and it is fortunate he has found some one\r\nif you are to be my housekeeper. If he makes any trouble we\'ll just\r\nremind him that it was only your summers that you were to spend with\r\nhim. Your winters belong to me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe he will quarrel about it," was Jean\'s answer. "He\r\nwon\'t need me now, and he will understand that you do."\r\n\r\n"I sure do," replied Uncle Tom, drawing the girl to his side. "I need\r\nboth of you--my boy and my girl."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stories in this series are:\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF COTTON\r\nTHE STORY OF GOLD AND SILVER\r\nTHE STORY OF LUMBER\r\nTHE STORY OF WOOL\r\nTHE STORY OF IRON\r\nTHE STORY OF LEATHER\r\nTHE STORY OF GLASS\r\nTHE STORY OF SUGAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Story of Glass, by Sara Ware Bassett\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STORY OF GLASS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 20698-8.txt or 20698-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/6/9/20698/\r\n\r\nProduced by Sigal Alon, La Monte H.P.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
