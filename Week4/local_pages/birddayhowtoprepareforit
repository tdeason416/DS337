Their descriptions of the appearance and habits of\r\nthe birds they had observed were given with evident pleasure. They had\r\na strong desire to tell what they had seen, not in the spirit of\r\nrivalry, but with the wish of adding to the knowledge of a subject in\r\nwhich all were equally interested.\r\n\r\nIt was thought that this work would be done with even more\r\neffectiveness if a day were appointed to be celebrated as "Bird Day."\r\nWith the hope of making a memorable occasion of the day for those\r\ntaking part in it, several of the noted friends of birds were asked to\r\nwrite something to the children, and to give their opinion of the\r\nintroduction of "Bird Day" into the schools.\r\n\r\nSecretary J. Sterling Morton, the father of "Arbor Day," responded\r\nwith the following earnest letter, which was at once given to the\r\npublic through Washington dispatches, and later was sent out from the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, in circular No. 17:--\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., April 23, 1894.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. BABCOCK, SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS, OIL CITY, PA.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_,--Your proposition to establish a "Bird Day" on\r\n     the same general plan as "Arbor Day," has my cordial\r\n     approval.\r\n\r\n     Such a movement can hardly fail to promote the development\r\n     of a healthy public sentiment toward our native birds,\r\n     favoring their preservation and increase. If directed toward\r\n     this end, and not to the encouragement of the importation of\r\n     foreign species, it is sure to meet the approval of the\r\n     American people.\r\n\r\n     It is a melancholy fact that among the enemies of our birds\r\n     two of the most destructive and relentless are our women and\r\n     our boys. The love of feather ornamentation so heartlessly\r\n     persisted in by thousands of women, and the mania for\r\n     collecting eggs and killing birds so deeply rooted in our\r\n     boys, are legacies of barbarism inherited from our savage\r\n     ancestry. The number of beautiful and useful birds annually\r\n     slaughtered for bonnet trimmings runs up into the hundreds\r\n     of thousands, and threatens, if it has not already\r\n     accomplished, the extermination of some of the rarer\r\n     species. The insidious egg-hunting and pea-shooting\r\n     proclivities of the small boy are hardly less widespread and\r\n     destructive. It matters little which of the two agencies is\r\n     the more fatal, since neither is productive of any good. One\r\n     looks to the gratification of a shallow vanity, the other to\r\n     the gratification of a cruel instinct and an expenditure of\r\n     boyish energy that might be profitably diverted into other\r\n     channels. The evil is one against which legislation can be\r\n     only palliative and of local efficiency. Public sentiment,\r\n     on the other hand, if properly fostered in the schools,\r\n     would gain force with the growth and development of our boys\r\n     and girls, and would become a hundredfold more potent than\r\n     any law enacted by the State or Congress. I believe such a\r\n     sentiment can be developed, so strong and so universal that\r\n     a respectable woman will be ashamed to be seen with the wing\r\n     of a wild bird on her bonnet, and an honest boy will be\r\n     ashamed to own that he ever robbed a nest or wantonly took\r\n     the life of a bird.\r\n\r\n     Birds are of inestimable value to mankind. Without their\r\n     unremitting services our gardens and fields would be laid\r\n     waste by insect pests. But we owe them a greater debt even\r\n     than this, for the study of birds tends to develop some of\r\n     the best attributes and impulses of our natures. Among them\r\n     we find examples of generosity, unselfish devotion, of the\r\n     love of mother for offspring, and other estimable qualities.\r\n     Their industry, patience, and ingenuity excite our\r\n     admiration; their songs inspire us with a love of music and\r\n     poetry; their beautiful plumages and graceful manners appeal\r\n     to our \xc3\xa6sthetic sense; their long migrations to distant\r\n     lands stimulate our imaginations and tempt us to inquire\r\n     into the causes of these periodic movements; and finally,\r\n     the endless modifications of form and habits by which they\r\n     are enabled to live under most diverse conditions of food\r\n     and climate--on land and at sea--invite the student of\r\n     nature into inexhaustible fields of pleasurable research.\r\n\r\n     The cause of bird protection is one that appeals to the best\r\n     side of our natures. Let us yield to the appeal. Let us have\r\n     a Bird Day--a day set apart from all the other days of the\r\n     year to tell the children about the birds. But we must not\r\n     stop here. We should strive continually to develop and\r\n     intensify the sentiment of bird protection, not alone for\r\n     the sake of preserving the birds, but also for the sake of\r\n     replacing as far as possible the barbaric impulses inherent\r\n     in child nature by the nobler impulses and aspirations that\r\n     should characterize advanced civilization.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nJ. STERLING MORTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of Agriculture._\r\n\r\nOther friends of the birds responded cordially to the request, as will\r\nbe seen by the following letters:--\r\n\r\nWEST PARK, N. Y., April 22, 1894.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_,--In response to yours of the seventeenth, I\r\n     enclose a few notes about birds to be read upon your "Bird\r\n     Day"--just an item or two to stimulate the curiosity of the\r\n     young people. The idea is a good one, and I hope you may\r\n     succeed in starting a movement that may extend to all the\r\n     schools of the country.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\nJOHN BURROUGHS.\r\n\r\n628 HANCOCK STREET, BROOKLYN, N. Y., April 25, 1894.\r\n\r\nMR. C. A. BABCOCK.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_,--Yours of the nineteenth is received. I am\r\n     delighted to know that your school children are to have a\r\n     "Bird Day." I wish I could be there to tell them something\r\n     of the delight of getting acquainted with their little\r\n     brothers in feathers; how much more interesting they are\r\n     when alive and doing all sorts of quaint and charming things\r\n     than when dead and made into "skins" or stuffed; and how\r\n     much greater is the pleasure of watching them to see how\r\n     they live, where they get their dinner, how they take care\r\n     of themselves, than of killing them, or hurting them, or\r\n     even just driving them away. If the boys and girls only try\r\n     keeping still and watching birds to see what they will do, I\r\n     am sure no boy will ever again want to throw a stone at one,\r\n     and no girl ever to have a dead bird on her hat.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\nOLIVE THORNE MILLER.\r\n\r\nCLINTON, April 30, 1894.\r\n\r\n     _My Dear Sir_,--It strikes me that your idea is a\r\n     particularly happy one. Should you institute a "Bird Day,"\r\n     the feathered tribe ought to furnish music for the occasion.\r\n     A chorus of robins and thrushes and a few other songsters\r\n     would be more appropriate than an orchestra. With thanks for\r\n     your cordial good wishes, I am,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\nCLINTON SCOLLARD.\r\n\r\nFrom the Department of Public Instruction of Pennsylvania this\r\nencouraging letter was received:--\r\n\r\nHARRISBURG, April 27, 1894.\r\n\r\nSUPERINTENDENT C. A. BABCOCK.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_,--In your plan to inaugurate a "Bird Day" you\r\n     have struck a capital idea. When in the name of agriculture\r\n     a scalp act can be passed resulting in a year and a half in\r\n     the payment of $75,000 by the county treasuries of\r\n     Pennsylvania for the destruction of birds that were\r\n     subsequently proved to belong to the feathered friends of\r\n     the farmer, it is high time to make our pupils acquainted\r\n     with the habits and ways of the feathered tribes. Some birds\r\n     remain with us the whole year, others are summer sojourners,\r\n     still others are only transient visitors. How much of the\r\n     beauty of our environment is lost by those who never listen\r\n     to the music of the birds and never see the richness of\r\n     their plumage!\r\n\r\n     May success attend you in carrying out your new idea of a\r\n     "Bird Day."\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\nNATHAN C. SCHAEFFER,\r\n\r\n_Superintendent of Public Instruction_.\r\n\r\nBradford Torrey gives an additional title to the day, showing his\r\nappreciation of it:--\r\n\r\nWELLESLEY HILLS, MASS., April 21, 1894.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Mr. Babcock_,--Your young people are to be\r\n     congratulated. "Bird Day" is something new to me--a new\r\n     saints\' day in my calendar, so to speak. The thought is so\r\n     pleasing to me that I wish you had given me its date, so\r\n     that in spirit I might observe it with you. Tell your pupils\r\n     that to cultivate an acquaintance with things out of\r\n     doors--flowers, trees, rocks, but especially animate\r\n     creatures, and best of all, birds--is one of the surest ways\r\n     of laying up happiness for themselves; and laying up\r\n     happiness is even better than laying up money, though I am\r\n     so old-fashioned a body and so true a Yankee as to believe\r\n     in that also.\r\n\r\n     All the naturalists I have known have been men of sunny\r\n     temper. Let your boys and girls cultivate their eyes and\r\n     ears, and their hearts and minds as well, by the study of\r\n     living birds, their comings and goings, their songs and\r\n     their ways; let them learn to find out things for\r\n     themselves; to know the difference between guess-work and\r\n     knowledge; and they will thank you as long as they live for\r\n     having encouraged them in so good a cause. With all good\r\n     wishes for the success of your first "Bird Day"--and many to\r\n     come after it,\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\nBRADFORD TORREY.\r\n\r\nThe first observance of "Bird Day," May 4, 1894, is briefly set forth\r\nin the following paragraph from the _New England Journal of\r\nEducation_:--\r\n\r\n     The day was observed in the Oil City schools with a degree\r\n     of enthusiasm which was good to see. The amount of\r\n     information about birds that was collected by the children\r\n     was simply amazing. Original compositions were read,\r\n     informal discussions were held, talks by teachers were\r\n     given, and the birds in literature were not forgotten or\r\n     overlooked. The interest was not confined to the children,\r\n     one gentleman surprising the classes in which his children\r\n     celebrated the day by presenting to them artistic programs\r\n     of the exercises.\r\n\r\n     It seems to those interested that the idea simply needs to\r\n     be made known to meet with a warm welcome, akin to that with\r\n     which we greet our first robin or song sparrow in the\r\n     spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably few people understand the value of birds or comprehend how\r\nclosely and yet how extensively their lives are interwoven with other\r\nforms of life. The general sentiment in regard to them, at the best,\r\nhas been that they are harmless, even interesting and beautiful\r\ncreatures; but the idea that they are one of the most important\r\nclasses of creation, a class upon which the existence of many other\r\nclasses depends, has never been widely prevalent. Suppose we were\r\nasked which is of more use to man, the fishes of our waters or the\r\nbirds of our forests and fields? Many of us would unhesitatingly\r\nanswer in favor of the fishes.\r\n\r\nIf all of these denizens of the rivers, lakes, and seas should be\r\ndestroyed, it would be a stupendous calamity. Mankind would\r\nuniversally deplore it; and if the nations of the world should, at any\r\ntime, become convinced that such a thing might occur, how quickly they\r\nwould take all possible means to prevent it! All civilized people now\r\nhave laws to preserve this food supply and are making expensive and\r\nlaborious efforts to increase it. Any one who should destroy thousands\r\nof tons of these edible swimmers, simply for their heads and tails, or\r\nfins and scales, would be regarded as a dangerous person. But if our\r\nsupposition were realized, if every fin and gill were to disappear\r\nfrom the waters of the globe, what would be the result? A misfortune,\r\ntruly, for the fins represent a large part of the world\'s supply of\r\nfood, and this loss would be felt more deeply as time went on, because\r\nthe ocean will not raise its rent, however crowded may be the\r\npopulation of its shores. The effort to secure the fish might be\r\napplied, however, in other directions and be equally remunerative.\r\nHarvest would still follow seedtime; the gold of autumn still reward\r\nthe shallow mines of spring.\r\n\r\nBut suppose we were forced to the dreadful alternative of choosing\r\nbetween the birds and the quadrupeds, again, the most of us would\r\nprobably decide against the birds. If the four-footed beasts should\r\ndisappear from the earth, it would be a much greater disaster than the\r\ndestruction of the fishes. A much larger fraction of the food supply\r\nwould be lost; while many of these animals contribute to man\'s comfort\r\nand necessities in almost innumerable ways. Most nations have learned\r\nto cherish their friends with hoofs and horns, and even some of those\r\nwith claws. Cruelty to animals is now generally forbidden by law; and\r\ntheir wanton destruction would be regarded with horror. No one would\r\nbe permitted to slaughter large numbers of them because he might wish\r\nto sell their horns or ears or the tips of their tails.\r\n\r\nBy the departure of the quadrupeds the life of man would be rendered\r\nmuch more difficult, but would still be possible. From fish and fowl\r\nhe could obtain a supply of meat limited in variety, yet sufficient\r\nfor his needs. The treasures of the vegetable world would still be\r\nhis, though he would miss the help of his animal allies in securing\r\nthem; but his ingenuity would help him to supply this loss, in part,\r\nat least.\r\n\r\nConsider now what would be the effect of the total destruction of\r\nbirds. Birds are nature\'s check to the amazing power of insects to\r\nincrease. If insect life were allowed free course, it would soon\r\noverpower vegetation; and plant life--and, therefore, animal life,\r\nincluding that of man--would be impossible upon this globe. This is an\r\nastounding conclusion, but it is sustained by the judgment of every\r\nman of science who has investigated the subject. How long could the\r\nravages of insects be stayed were the birds gone? We should have to\r\ndepend upon a few predaceous beetles, the bats, and upon the sprayers\r\nand squirtguns which throw insecticides. Think of the \xc3\xa6sthetic loss in\r\nsubstituting these agencies for the "sweet spirits" of the wood and\r\nfield! Besides not being musical or charming in action, they would\r\nnot prove efficient. Birds are therefore essential to the life of man.\r\n\r\nTheir preservation is not merely a matter of sentiment, or of\r\neducation in that high and fine feeling, kindness to all living\r\nthings. It has a utilitarian side of vast extent, as broad as our\r\nboundless fields and our orchards\' sweep. The birds are nature\'s\r\nguarantee that the reign of the crawlers and spinners shall not become\r\nuniversal. The "plague of locusts" shall be upon those who sin against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom almost all sections of the country comes the plaint that the song\r\nbirds are fast disappearing. Less and less numerous are the yearly\r\nvisitations of the thrushes, warblers, song sparrows, orioles, and the\r\nothers whose habits have been so delightful and whose music has been\r\nso cheering to their open-eyed and open-hearted friends. Many, who\r\nwhen listening to the hymn-like cadences of the wood thrush have felt\r\nthat the place was holy ground, are now keenly regretting that this\r\nvesper song is so rare; the honest sweetness of the song sparrow\r\nmingles with the coarser sounds less often in the accustomed places.\r\nNot many now find "the meadows spattered all over with music" by the\r\nbobolink, as Thoreau did.\r\n\r\nJohn Burroughs says that the bluebird is almost extinct in his section\r\nof country. The writer, though a frequent visitor to the fields and\r\nwoods, has succeeded in seeing only one pair of these beautiful birds\r\nin two seasons, where they were abundant a few years ago, when almost\r\nevery orchard bore a good crop of them. A friend who is a good\r\nobserver has had the same experience. A careful exploration of the\r\ncountry within a radius of five miles resulted in the discovery of\r\nonly two pairs of bobolinks, having their nests luckily in the same\r\nfield. The males sang together in friendly rivalry. The sparkling,\r\ntinkling notes seemed to come in a rippling tumble, two or three at a\r\ntime, from each throat. Each started his song with his feet barely\r\ntouching his perch, his body quivering, his wings half extended, as if\r\nhe were almost supported by the upward flow of his melody. After\r\ncircular flights he alighted first upon one frail, swinging perch,\r\nthen upon another, the wonderful sounds not ceasing, as if he were\r\ntracing magic rings of song round his home, and making them thick in\r\nplaces. It was a musical embodiment of the love of life and of its\r\njoyousness.\r\n\r\nThe brown thrush is also absent from places where once there were\r\nmany. A farmer in this neighborhood states that a few years ago the\r\ntreetops near his house seemed to be filled with these fine singers.\r\nNow he hears only one or two during the season. Last May the writer\r\nfound three nests at least a mile apart, but they were destroyed\r\nbefore the time of hatching, and the birds went about silent as if\r\nbrooding upon their trouble. It is doubtful if they will build next\r\nseason in that vicinity. No doubt the clearing away of the forests and\r\nthe settling up of the country are responsible for the scarcity of the\r\nbirds in part, but only in part. If they were let alone, many of the\r\nmost interesting and useful birds would build near even our city\r\nhomes, and our gardens and fields would again become populous with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe wearing of feathers and the skins of birds for ornament is the\r\nchief cause of the final flight of many of our songsters. It is stated\r\nthat a London dealer received at one time more than thirty thousand\r\ndead humming birds. Not only brightly colored birds, but any small\r\nbirds, by means of dyes, may come at last to such base uses. It is\r\nestimated by some of the Audubon societies that ten million birds were\r\nused in this country in one season. All these bodies, which are used\r\nto make "beauty much more beauteous seem," are steeped in arsenical\r\nsolutions to prevent their becoming as offensive to the nostrils of\r\ntheir wearers as they are to the eyes of bird lovers.\r\n\r\nThe use of dead birds for adornment is a constant object lesson in\r\ncruelty, a declaration louder than any words that a bird\'s life is not\r\nto be respected. It is currently reported that a million bobolinks\r\nwere destroyed in Pennsylvania alone last year to satisfy the demand\r\nof the milliners. If this "garniture of death" is in good taste, then\r\nour North American Indian in his war paint and feathers was far ahead\r\nof his time.\r\n\r\nLet us hope that some oracle of fashion will decree that if the\r\nremains of animals must be used for adornment, the skins of mice and\r\nrats shall be offered up. Their office seems to be principally that of\r\nscavengers, and their gradual but certain extinction would not matter\r\nif the Christian nations should become, _pari passu_, more cleanly.\r\nThe squirrel could also be used effectively, mounted as if half\r\nflying, with his hind feet fastened to the velvet pedestal, or sitting\r\nupon his haunches with a nut between his fore paws. The squirrel\'s\r\nmain concern seems to be to prevent the undue extension of the\r\nnut-bearing trees--an office man has already well taken upon\r\nhimself--and besides, he destroys fruit, injures trees, and is a great\r\nenemy of birds. His gradual extinction would be tolerated by a\r\ncivilized nation.\r\n\r\nAll these things may take the hues of the rainbow and are capable of\r\ninfinite variety of arrangement. There certainly seems to be no good\r\nreason why in a few years some combination of them may not be\r\nconsidered as effective as a row of dead humming birds. The world may\r\nbe saved in this way from presenting a spectacle that should excite\r\nthe pity of gods and men--the spectacle of the destruction of one of\r\nthe most beautiful, the most harmless, and the most useful classes of\r\ncreation, at the command of the senseless whims of fashion.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the sportsmen\'s guns and the small boys\' slings and\r\nshooters of various sorts are constantly bringing down numbers of the\r\nfeathered songsters. In many parts of our country men and boys roam\r\nthe fields, shooting at every bird they see, and their action is\r\ntacitly approved by the community. This survival of the barbarous\r\ninstinct to kill is condoned as "sport." If these people were to spend\r\nthis time in following the birds with opera glass and notebook to\r\nstudy them, they might not be so readily understood--they might even\r\nbe taken for mild lunatics, so utterly is public sentiment perverted\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nA little consideration shows this destruction to be more disastrous\r\nthan at first appears. According to the latest biological science,\r\nevery species of animals must have long ago reached the limit beyond\r\nwhich it could not greatly increase its numbers. However great its\r\ntendency to increase might be, its natural obstacles and enemies\r\nwould increase in like proportions till at last the two would balance\r\neach other, and there could be no further increase in the number of\r\nindividuals of that species. All classes of animals in a state of\r\nnature must have reached this balanced condition generations ago. This\r\nis true of the birds. Their natural enemies are capable of preventing\r\ntheir increase; that is, they can and do destroy every year as many as\r\nare hatched that year. Now if man be added as a new destructive\r\nagency, the old enemies, being still able to destroy as many as\r\nbefore, will soon sweep them out of existence. Warnings have been sent\r\nout by the United States Department of Biology that several species of\r\nbirds are already close to extinction. We know that this is true of\r\nthe passenger pigeon. This bird used to come North in flocks so\r\nextensive as sometimes to obscure the sun, like a large, thick cloud.\r\nNow they come no more. Italy is practically songless, we are told.\r\n\r\nIf man would right the wrong that he has done, he must not only stop\r\ndestroying the birds, but he must take all possible means to preserve\r\nthem and to protect them from their natural foes.\r\n\r\nLaws for bird protection have been passed in many of our states; but\r\nthese have been found effective only where they were not needed. They\r\nare, however, right, and will help in the development of correct\r\nsentiment. What is most needed is knowledge of the birds themselves,\r\ntheir modes of life, their curious ways, and their relations to the\r\nscheme of things. To know a bird is to love him. Birds are beautiful\r\nand interesting objects of study, and make appeals to children that\r\nare responded to with delight.\r\n\r\nChildren love intensely the forms of nature--the clouds, the trees,\r\nthe flowers, the animals--all of the great beautiful world outside of\r\nthemselves, and it is their impulse to become acquainted with this\r\nworld; for this they feel enthusiasm and love. Marjorie Fleming, the\r\nlittle playmate of Scott, who at the age of six could recite passages\r\nfrom Shakespeare and Burns so that the great bard would sob like a\r\nchild or shout with laughter, may be taken as the universal voice of\r\nchildhood. She writes in her diary, "I am going to a delightful place\r\nwhere there is ducks, cocks, hens, bubblejacks, two dogs, two cats and\r\nswine which is delightful." In another place she says, "Braehead is\r\nextremely pleasant to me by the company of swine, geese, cocks, etc.,\r\nand they are the delight of my soul."\r\n\r\nThe waste of time in our public schools has been commented upon and\r\nsome of the causes have been pointed out; but is not the chief reason\r\nthe fact that much of the work of the school is unrelated to the world\r\nof the child? At least the child does not see the connection. He\r\nleaves at the threshold the things which he loves and desires\r\nintensely to investigate, and begins his intellectual development with\r\nabstractions, with "the three R\'s." It is said that teachers cannot\r\nsucceed unless they love their work. How can we expect children to\r\nsucceed and not waste time, not become disheartened at work that, so\r\nfar as they can discover, has little more relation to their interests\r\nthan to the mountains of the moon?\r\n\r\nWe look to nature study to supply the missing links between the\r\nchild\'s life and his school work; to afford opportunities for the\r\ninterested observation of things, and to furnish a strong impulse\r\ntoward expression. It has been well said that the best result of the\r\nprimary schools is the power to use correctly one\'s own language. The\r\nchief obstacle in the development of this power is the want of an\r\nimpulse to express. What can afford a stronger tendency to describe\r\nthan the attempt to report observations that have been made with\r\ninterest, even with delight?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nPLAN OF STUDY\r\n\r\n\r\nBegin as soon after the first of January as possible. Assign two\r\nperiods a week of from ten to twenty minutes each for bird study in\r\nthe school. Continue the work during these periods until after the\r\ncelebration of Bird Day in May.\r\n\r\nIf no other bird is to be found, the English sparrow will answer.\r\nPlace the following questions upon the blackboard:--\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH SPARROW\r\n\r\n     How long is this bird from the tip of its beak to the end of\r\n     its tail?\r\n\r\n     What is the color of its head? Of its throat? Of its breast?\r\n     Of the underparts of its body? Of its back? Of its wings?\r\n\r\n     What is the length, shape, and color of its bill?\r\n\r\n     What is the color of its legs and feet? How many toes upon\r\n     each foot, and which way do they point? Does it walk, hop,\r\n     or run upon the ground? Is its tail square, or notched? Is\r\n     its flight even and steady, or bounding? What is the\r\n     difference in appearance between the male and female?\r\n\r\nThe children should be directed to answer these questions from their\r\nown observation, at the next period of study. For the lowest grades\r\ntwo or three questions will be enough for the first attempt, and even\r\nthen the variety of answers will be surprising.\r\n\r\nNo other questions should be taken until the first are answered\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\nThe teacher should have an opera glass or a small field glass with\r\nwhich to make her own observations. It is obvious that the more\r\nglasses there are among the children, the better. It is advisable for\r\nthe teacher to make short excursions with the children to the streets\r\nto assist them in answering these questions. These can be made at the\r\nclose of school. As a preparation, have some crumbs or seeds scattered\r\nwhere the birds have been seen.\r\n\r\nContinue work with these questions until each one can give a\r\nreasonably accurate description of the appearance of the bird and of\r\nits movements. Have the older pupils write this. It will make a good\r\nlanguage lesson.\r\n\r\nThe next questions should have reference to the life and\r\ncharacteristics of the bird. What does it eat? Put out crumbs or\r\nscraps of meat and see if the bird will eat them. What sounds does the\r\nbird make? Does it sing? Imitate as many of its sounds as you can.\r\nDetermine from its actions what its disposition is. For example--Is it\r\ncourageous? Is it quarrelsome? Is it inclined to fight? Is it selfish?\r\n\r\nFrequently a single incident in a bird\'s life will furnish an answer\r\nto several of these questions. Two sparrows were seen attempting to\r\ntake possession of the same straw. Each held firmly to his end of the\r\nstraw. A regular tug of war ensued. They pulled one another about for\r\nsome time on the top of an awning, and finally, becoming tired of\r\nthis, they dropped the straw and furiously attacked each other. They\r\nfought with beak and claw, paying no attention to the spectators, and\r\nfell exhausted to the sidewalk, where they lay upon their backs until\r\nable to hop slowly away from each other. It was some little time\r\nbefore they recovered strength to fly in opposite directions,\r\nconquering and unconquered.\r\n\r\nEarly in March advise the children to watch the direction of the\r\nsparrows\' flight. They will discover that some of them are carrying\r\nstraws or feathers or other material for nest building. Notice the\r\nposition and style of these nests. Those built early in the season are\r\nalways in protected places, under the eaves of houses or in holes in\r\ntrees or in bird boxes. Some of those built later are in exposed\r\nplaces, clumsy affairs, but well thatched with straw, having an\r\nentrance on one side. This nest building may be watched during the\r\nentire season, for the English sparrow raises more broods than any\r\nother of our birds.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of the actions which indicate any of a bird\'s\r\ncharacteristics is a valuable part of the study on account of its\r\nexercise of the imagination and the reason.\r\n\r\nA plan similar to the foregoing should be followed with each bird that\r\nis studied. With almost all other birds the study will be far more\r\ninteresting. The English sparrow may be considered as the A B C of\r\nbirds in his appearance and in the kind of life he leads. He is\r\ntherefore a good subject to begin with. But even he will be found to\r\nexhibit unexpected individuality.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days of this study, or at least before the spring birds\r\nbegin to arrive, direct the children to try the following experiments.\r\nScatter crumbs where they may be seen from the windows. Nail cups in\r\nthe trees containing sugar and water, and others containing seeds.\r\nNail up a bone or two, and a piece of suet as large as your two hands.\r\nThis last will be relished by the birds, for it provides the kind of\r\nfood most needed in cold weather.\r\n\r\nWatch carefully the birds that are attracted by the food. After\r\nfeeding awhile they will become quite tame and may be closely\r\napproached. Write a description of each bird upon the plan used for\r\nthe English sparrow. Encourage the children to add any observations of\r\ntheir own which throw light upon the habits and character of the\r\nbirds, since one object of this study is the development of right\r\nfeeling toward them.\r\n\r\nAmong the first to arrive will probably be the blue jay, chickadee, or\r\nblack-capped titmouse, and one or more of the woodpeckers. These all\r\nshow individual character and are well worth studying.\r\n\r\nThe blue jay by his striking appearance and outlandish voice\r\nchallenges attention. He will be found to possess some gentlemanly\r\ntraits. To illustrate, a number of blue jays were seen taking turns,\r\nwaiting in line, to feed upon a bone where there was room for only\r\none at a time. There was no scramble, no hurrying of the one who was\r\neating. The blue jay is a most devoted parent, though not considered a\r\ngood citizen by other birds. Contrary to the usual belief, he has a\r\nbeautiful song. It is sweet and low and almost as varied as the\r\ncatbird\'s, and can be heard only a short distance. It has a\r\nreminiscent character, as if he were thinking of past joys.\r\n\r\nThe black-capped titmouse or the chickadee is noticeable for his\r\nsprightliness and cheeriness, and for his trim, tailor-made\r\nappearance. Emerson\'s poem worthily celebrates his brave spirit. He\r\nflits around a limb and clings to it with his head up or down, with\r\nhis feet up or down, as if his movements were not physical exertions,\r\nbut mental efforts. His simple little song rings out at all hours of\r\nthe coldest day.\r\n\r\nThe woodpecker gives himself freely to study. One winter we frequently\r\ncounted from twelve to fourteen children standing under the tree on\r\nwhich a little sapsucker was at work. The upturned faces of the\r\nchildren did not disturb him at all, although he was only a little\r\nabove their heads. He drilled away as if his work in the world was the\r\nwork which must be done. A downy woodpecker with a slightly wounded\r\nwing was brought into one of our schoolrooms, where he lived\r\ncontentedly for several days, pecking a dead treetop, which the boys\r\nbrought in for him after a good deal of thought and several\r\nexcursions. The only food he seemed to like was sweetened water,\r\nalthough the children brought him a great variety to choose from. No\r\nvisitor to a schoolroom ever produced a better effect. His presence,\r\ninstead of interfering with the regular order, pleased the children,\r\nand they did their work even better than usual. When his wing was\r\nhealed he was dismissed from school through the window, and his flight\r\nto a neighboring treetop was anxiously watched.\r\n\r\nUpon many other occasions wounded birds have been brought into our\r\nschools. Some recovered and others died, but each visit was an epoch\r\nin the life of the school.\r\n\r\nThe other birds most likely to visit this feast during January are the\r\nflicker, crow, purple finch, song sparrow, white-breasted nuthatch,\r\nsnow-flake; American crossbill, white-throated sparrow, tree sparrow,\r\njunco, winter wren, golden-crowned kinglet, brown creeper, and even\r\nthe solitary robin. The sparrow hawk and the sharp-shinned hawk may\r\nvisit the vicinity to feed upon the other feeders. On the first of\r\nJanuary I saw a sparrow hawk sitting on the spire of a church in the\r\nheart of a city of eighteen thousand people. After selecting a victim\r\nfrom the sparrows on the street below, he calmly spread his wings and\r\npounced upon him, or with no effort at concealment chased the bird\r\nwhose flight was nearest.\r\n\r\nA female sparrow hawk wintered in the eaves of an apartment house in\r\nMorningside Park, New York City. English sparrow was its principal\r\ndiet, and every morning and afternoon an observer might have seen the\r\nhawk soar to the park grounds on its hunting trips.\r\n\r\nA few years ago a sharp-shinned hawk visited our yard. Apparently he\r\nlived upon the sparrows there for several days. There was no skill in\r\nhis hunting or effort to take the game unawares. When he wanted a bird\r\nhe simply left his perch and captured it by speed of wing. His ease of\r\nflight was remarkable; as a little boy said, "He just opened his wings\r\nand sailed away." He stayed until the sparrows left the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAs the season advances the birds will come in greater numbers. On the\r\nfirst of April a little girl in one of our schools had identified and\r\ndescribed seventeen different species of birds which she had seen in\r\nher yard. The same child fed a family of chipping sparrows; they\r\nbecame so tame that they would come to meet her when she came with\r\ncrumbs, and would pick them up even when they dropped close to her\r\nfeet. The next year this family evidently came again and raised\r\nanother brood and brought them along to be fed, for seven and\r\nsometimes eight would come when she called. The English sparrow came\r\nalso, and the little maid drove them away without the chippies being\r\ndisturbed. A boy from one of our schools was even more fortunate. In\r\nhis yard were a number of trees in which ample provision had been made\r\nfor the birds. Late in April, with other kinds a pair of scarlet\r\ntanagers and a pair of rose-breasted grosbeaks visited the trees.\r\nThese stayed and soon seemed to feel quite at home. To the great\r\ndelight of their neighbors, the house-dwellers, they built their\r\nnests, the grosbeaks in a tree near one side of the porch, the\r\ntanagers in one near the opposite side. They became so friendly that\r\nsometimes when the boy came out upon the porch and played softly on a\r\nmouth organ, the grosbeak\'s silvery warble and the tanager\'s loud,\r\nclear voice joined him.\r\n\r\nBrief written descriptions should be made by the pupils, similar to\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n     BLUEBIRD.--Length, six and a half inches; extent of wings,\r\n     about twelve inches; color, back, azure blue; throat,\r\n     breast, and sides, dull crimson; underpart, white; bill and\r\n     legs, blackish; eye, brown; arrives early in March; leaves\r\n     in late November. Song, soft and pleasing warble; sings both\r\n     in flight and at rest; nests in holes of trees or posts, or\r\n     in bird houses.\r\n\r\n     CHICKADEE.--Length, about five and a half inches; extent of\r\n     wings, about eight inches; legs, bluish gray; bill, black;\r\n     back, brownish gray; throat, chin, and top of head, black;\r\n     sides of head, white; underparts, whitish; wing and tail\r\n     feathers margined with white; nests in holes in trees and\r\n     stumps. The common name arises from their familiar note of\r\n     "chic-a-dee-dee."\r\n\r\n     CATBIRD.--Length, nine inches; extent of wings, eleven and a\r\n     half inches; bill and feet, black; eye, brown; color, slate\r\n     color, somewhat lighter beneath; top of head and tail,\r\n     black; reddish under the wings; arrives in May, leaves in\r\n     October; nests in bushes; lives in gardens and woodside\r\n     thickets; has a sharp cry not unlike the mewing of a cat,\r\n     but is a gifted songster.\r\n\r\n     MEADOW LARK.--Length, about ten and a half inches; extent of\r\n     wings, about sixteen and a half inches; female is smaller;\r\n     body, thick and stout; legs, large; hind toe reaches out\r\n     beyond the tail, its claw twice as long as the middle one;\r\n     bill, brown, lighter at the base, dark towards the point;\r\n     feet and legs, light brown; throat, breast, and edge of\r\n     wing, bright yellow; breast with a large black crescent;\r\n     nests on the ground in the open field; clumsy in flight and\r\n     in walking; song, a plaintive whistle; arrives in March,\r\n     leaves in October.\r\n\r\n     BARN SWALLOW.--Length, six and three fourths inches; spread\r\n     of wings, twelve and a half inches; bill, black; legs and\r\n     feet, light brown; color, upper parts glossy steel blue;\r\n     tail, very deeply forked, outer tail feathers much longer\r\n     and narrower than the others; forehead, chin, and throat,\r\n     deep chestnut; rest of the underparts lighter; nests usually\r\n     in barns.\r\n\r\n     WOOD THRUSH.--Length, eight inches; spread of wings,\r\n     thirteen inches; legs and feet, flesh-colored; bill,\r\n     blackish, lighter at base; upper parts cinnamon brown,\r\n     brightest on top of the head, and shading into olive near\r\n     the tail; lower parts white and marked with roundish, dusky\r\n     spots; arrives the first of May, leaves in October. Song\r\n     consists of sweet, ringing, bell-like notes.\r\n\r\nLater these outlines should be expanded into free descriptions,\r\ncontaining all that the pupil has learned about the bird, his habits,\r\nhis character, and his life.\r\n\r\nEach school should aim to possess a bird manual, for the\r\nidentification of the species. The following are recommended as\r\nsufficient for the purpose: "Birds of the United States," by A. C.\r\nApgar; "Birds of Eastern North America," by Frank M. Chapman; "Bird\r\nCraft," by Mabel Osgood Wright; "Birds of Pennsylvania," second\r\nedition, by Warren (this may possibly be obtained at second-hand\r\nbookstores); "Our Common Birds and How to Know Them," by Grant. The\r\nreport of your own state upon birds, if there is one, will also\r\nfurnish valuable information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nFURTHER SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nDirect the children to put up boxes for martins, bluebirds, and wrens.\r\nThese may be also put up around the schoolhouses, if fortunately there\r\nis a yard with trees. Boxes for the martins should be large,\r\ncontaining fifteen or more compartments, each ten inches high by eight\r\nwide and eight deep, and each having a separate entrance. The martin\r\nbox or house should be placed twenty feet from the ground, upon the\r\ntop of a strong post or platform sustained by four smaller posts. If\r\nvines are planted at the foot of the supports, they will be ornamental\r\nand will make the houses more attractive to the birds. The English\r\nsparrows will occupy these compartments; but if the martins conclude\r\nto take possession they will push out the sparrows and their\r\nbelongings without assistance. Every spring I am amused in watching\r\nthe summary process of ejectment which the martins serve upon the\r\nsparrows that have taken possession of their houses. In the morning\r\nthe sparrows may be in undisturbed possession, but by afternoon the\r\nmartins occupy their old quarters, having pushed out the nests of the\r\nsparrows with their eggs or young.\r\n\r\nThe boxes for bluebirds and wrens should be smaller and have only one\r\ncompartment. They should be nailed in the tops of trees. If the\r\nEnglish sparrows build in them their nests should be broken up; and\r\nthis repeatedly, so long as they persist in building. If this is not\r\ndone the wrens and bluebirds will not come. They are incapable of\r\ncoping with the sparrows.\r\n\r\nNote when the different birds arrive in the spring, making in this way\r\na bird calendar.\r\n\r\nNotice also when the birds gather together into flocks in the late\r\nsummer or autumn, preparatory to taking their leave. The last bird of\r\nhis kind to leave should be as carefully noted as the first to arrive\r\nin your calendar. Distinguish carefully the birds of passage that stop\r\nonly a short time to rest on their journeys north and south, and those\r\nthat stay and help to make the summer.\r\n\r\nYou will need to make frequent excursions afield, always taking your\r\nnotebook. Take first a small area and master the birds in that; then\r\ngradually extend your territory. You can take no more healthful or\r\nhappy exercise. It will greatly increase the interest of children in\r\nall their school duties if their teachers make occasional bird\r\njourneys with them. Limit the size of the party to that number which\r\nwill keep still as a mouse while in bird-land. Encourage the children\r\nalso to make frequent excursions by themselves, in parties of three or\r\nfour. Instruct them to have the sun at their backs and to carry if\r\npossible one glass with each party. Reports of these excursions can be\r\nmade in school, while particular attention should be given to the\r\nexchange of the knowledge of bird haunts. This can be done during the\r\nperiod devoted to bird study.\r\n\r\nDirect the party of excursionists to observe the same birds, notebook\r\nin hand, and let each one immediately put down what he actually sees.\r\nAfterward compare results. In this way improvement will be made in\r\nrapidity and accuracy of observing.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways by which birds may be closely approached. The first\r\nis to go to some locality where birds have been seen and to stand or\r\nsit in perfect quiet and wait for them to come. We have known some of\r\nthe shyest wood birds to come within a few feet of the motionless\r\nobserver. It is not an uncommon thing for one who waits to be able to\r\nlook directly into the eyes of the American redstart, the\r\nchestnut-sided and golden-winged warbler, the wood thrush, catbird,\r\nand of almost any other of the birds.\r\n\r\nIf one can imitate the owl and make a fair "hoot," otherwise keeping\r\nstill, he may attract many birds that will feel bound to settle the\r\nquestion of his identity. A young friend of mine, by a good imitation\r\nof a blue jay\'s quack, finds many little woods\' folks peering at him\r\nfrom the trees which he might not otherwise see. The "smack" which is\r\nproduced by violently kissing the back of the closed fingers will call\r\nmany birds from their hiding places, especially during the nesting\r\nseason. The sound is similar to that of a bird in distress.\r\n\r\nThe second method is to follow a bird very quietly and slowly, being\r\ncareful not to make any motions which would startle him. In this way a\r\nshore lark has been followed all over a field, the observer gradually\r\ncoming near enough to the bird to see what he was doing, and to watch\r\nhis movements as he pulled the larv\xc3\xa6 of beetles out of the ground,\r\ncracked their cases, and ate the contents. All birds that feed in the\r\nfields, the meadow larks, the plovers, and the sparrows, may be\r\nstudied in the same way.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly thought to be difficult to get close to the veery. On\r\none occasion, while the writer and a companion were resting from a\r\nlong ramble, the air was suddenly suffused with the songs of veeries.\r\nThe music seemed to fill the woods, as an organ seems to fill the\r\nchurch with sound. It was weird and suggestive and never to be\r\nforgotten. The still, deep woods seemed like enchanted ground where\r\nnothing evil could come. After some search we saw one of the birds in\r\na tree not far from us. As we approached him he flew to another tree.\r\nWe humbly followed on foot from tree to tree, when to our surprise he\r\nstopped on a low tree on the outskirts of the wood and allowed us to\r\ncome almost within reach of him, and to stand wonder-stricken while he\r\nsang in answer to his companions. We stayed for twenty minutes\r\nmotionless. It was difficult to believe that this bird was singing.\r\nHis notes had a ventriloquous effect, his beak was scarcely parted,\r\nand it was only by the trembling of the feathers of his throat that we\r\nwere sure the song came from him. Since this time we have frequently\r\nfound the veeries; in fact one locality is known to us as Veeryville.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to live in the country in order to be a bird\r\nstudent and to carry out the suggestions here given. All the large\r\ncities have parks where birds may be observed and be encouraged to\r\nbecome friendly to the observer. Central Park in New York is the home\r\nof a great variety of birds. Bronx Park is said to be a paradise for\r\nthem. On Boston Common most of the birds which come to that latitude\r\nhave been seen. There is no city so poor that it cannot boast of a few\r\nbirds in its vicinity.\r\n\r\nGreat interest and delight may be added to the study of birds by the\r\nuse of the camera. If the teacher or one of the older pupils is so\r\nfortunate as to have a kodak and will take it when visiting the woods,\r\nor will focus it upon birds in the dooryard, the pictures may possess\r\nmuch value. To attempt to "take" a bird in flight is, of course, a\r\ndifficult matter, though it may be done; but birds upon the nest,\r\nbirds feeding their young, or in the trees above the nest, evidently\r\nprotecting it, have been successfully taken. Birds\' nests with the\r\neggs in make most fascinating pictures. At an entertainment given by\r\nthe Pennsylvania Audubon Society in Philadelphia in December, 1898,\r\nthe audience with one accord cheered the picture of a nest which was\r\nthrown upon a screen.\r\n\r\nWork of this kind is especially adapted for high schools, and there\r\nare sure to be several painstaking amateurs among the pupils. To\r\npossess genuine value from the point of view of the naturalist, the\r\npictures should not be touched up, no matter how much artistic beauty\r\nmight thus be given to them; they should be entirely true to nature.\r\n\r\nOn no account should children be encouraged to make collections of\r\nbirds or of eggs. The only objection the author has felt to the very\r\nfine bird manuals before the public is that they contain minute\r\ndirections for the preparation of dead birds for purposes of mounting\r\nand preservation, and also for the collection and preservation of\r\nbirds\' eggs. If this were to cause the school children of the country\r\nto set out to make collections of birds and of eggs in order to study\r\nthem, the study would better be omitted. Nothing more deadly than an\r\nopera glass should be aimed at a bird for a generation. The utility\r\nof a collection is not so great; a dead bird\'s plumage is not as\r\nbeautiful as in life, and he loses every attitude and movement which\r\nmakes him an individual. A corpse is not a bird. Persons who can\r\nidentify birds by one glimpse of them through the trees, or by a few\r\nnotes of their song, or by their flight are frequently at a loss to\r\nidentify the same birds when they are dead, unless they are familiar\r\nwith the dead birds.\r\n\r\nThe only collection the children should be encouraged to make is that\r\nof nests after the birds are through with them; and especially of\r\nnests with whose family history they are acquainted. These may be\r\nbrought into the schoolroom. In one of our school yards the children\r\ndiscovered a pair of red-eyed vireos building. The nest was so\r\nsituated that it could be seen from one of the upper schoolroom\r\nwindows. After the young had left, the nest was taken down, and to the\r\npleasure which the children had enjoyed in watching its builders and\r\ntheir family was added another. They found in the bottom of the nest\r\nlittle bits of the papers they had used in school with their letters\r\nand figures upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR WRITTEN WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nHave the children give anecdotes about birds that they have observed.\r\nLet them describe actions which they saw them perform, paying\r\nparticular attention to the ways of birds in eating. For example,\r\nsparrows were observed carrying hard crusts of bread to a little pool\r\nof water, formed in a dent in a tin roof, to soften before attempting\r\nto eat them. Day after day crusts were put out, and the water was\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\n_Written descriptions of birds feeding their young._--Young birds live\r\nentirely upon insect life. It has been computed that a bird during the\r\nfirst few weeks of its life consumes nearly one and one half times its\r\nweight of insects daily. Note the amazing amount of insect life that\r\nwill be destroyed by the birds of a neighborhood in a single season.\r\nGive, if possible, illustrations from your own observation. A robin\r\nwas noticed feeding one of its young, which sat on a limb with its\r\nmouth open, crying for more, except when it was stopped with food. The\r\nparent came with her beak filled with worms twenty-seven times in less\r\nthan as many minutes, and then left her child seemingly as hungry as\r\never, for he complained and hopped along the limb, keeping a sharp\r\nlookout for several minutes. That chick must have been as full of\r\nworms as a fisherman\'s bait-box. Picture the condition of our lawns,\r\ngardens, and groves if all the birds were suddenly banished and the\r\ninsects held full sway. In this connection, the writer should study\r\nand make quotations or abstracts from "The Birds of Killingworth," by\r\nLongfellow.\r\n\r\nIn a recent lecture, Prof. Witmer Stone, of Philadelphia, cited many\r\nfacts to show that birds are nature\'s great check on the excess of\r\ninsects, and that they keep the balance between plants and insect\r\nlife. Ten thousand caterpillars, it has been estimated, could destroy\r\nevery blade of grass on an acre of cultivated ground. In thirty days\r\nfrom the time it is hatched an ordinary caterpillar increases 10,000\r\ntimes in bulk, and the food it lives and grows on is vegetable. The\r\ninsect population of a single cherry tree infested with aphides was\r\ncalculated by a prominent entomologist at no less than twelve million.\r\nThe bird population of cultivated country districts has been estimated\r\nat from seven hundred to one thousand per square mile. This is small\r\ncompared with the number of insects, yet as each bird consumes\r\nhundreds of insects every day, the latter are prevented from becoming\r\nthe scourge they would be but for their feathered enemies.\r\n\r\nMr. E. H. Forbush, Ornithologist of the Board of Agriculture of\r\nMassachusetts, states that the stomachs of four chickadees contained\r\n1,028 eggs of the cankerworm. The stomachs of four other birds of the\r\nsame species contained about 600 eggs and 105 female moths of the\r\ncankerworm. The average number of eggs found in twenty of these moths\r\nwas 185; and as it is estimated that a chickadee may eat thirty female\r\ncankerworm moths per day during the twenty-five days which these moths\r\ncrawl up trees, it follows that in this period each chickadee would\r\ndestroy 138,750 eggs of this noxious insect.\r\n\r\nA pamphlet issued by the Department of Agriculture of the United\r\nStates says that the cuckoo, which is common in all the Eastern\r\nStates, has been conclusively shown to be much given to eating\r\ncaterpillars, and, unlike most birds, does not reject those that are\r\ncovered with hair. In fact, cuckoos eat so many hairy caterpillars\r\nthat the hairs pierce the inner lining of their stomach and remain\r\nthere, so that when the stomach is opened and turned inside out, it\r\nappears to be lined with a thin coating of hair. This bird also eats\r\nbeetles, grasshoppers, sawflies, and spiders. It turns out from the\r\ninvestigations of the department that the suspicion with which all\r\nfarmers look upon woodpeckers is undeserved by that bird. These birds\r\nrarely leave an important mark upon a healthy tree, but when a tree\r\nis affected by wood-boring larv\xc3\xa6 the insects are accurately located,\r\ndislodged, and devoured. In case the holes from which the borers are\r\ntaken are afterward occupied and enlarged by colonies of ants, these\r\nants are drawn out and eaten. Woodpeckers are great conservators of\r\nforests, and to them more than to any other agency is due the\r\npreservation of timber from hordes of destructive insects.\r\n\r\nThe department defends the much-abused crow and states that he is not\r\nby any means the enemy of the farmer, in which r\xc3\xb4le he is generally\r\nrepresented. The pamphlet shows that he is known to eat frogs, toads,\r\nsalamanders, and some small snakes, and that he devours May beetles,\r\nJune bugs, grasshoppers, and a large variety of other destructive\r\ninsects. It is admitted that he does some damage to sprouting corn,\r\nbut this can be prevented by tarring the seed, which not only saves\r\nthe corn, but forces the crow to turn his attention to insects.\r\n\r\n_Insects injurious to vegetation._--Essays may be written describing\r\nsome of the insects injurious to fruit trees; also the birds that feed\r\nlargely upon these insects--the warblers, thrushes, orioles, wrens,\r\nwoodpeckers, vireos, and others. Tell, if possible, from your own\r\nobservation, of their curious, but effective, ways of finding their\r\nfood. Describe how the birds inspect the trees, limb by limb and bud\r\nby bud, in their eager search for the eggs, larv\xc3\xa6, and mature forms of\r\ninsects. Note, especially, the oriole as he runs spirally round a\r\nbranch to the very tip, then back to the trunk, treating branch after\r\nbranch in the same way, till the whole tree has been thoroughly\r\nsearched, almost every bud having been in the focus of those bright\r\neyes. It is hard to describe which is the more beautiful--their\r\nbrilliant, flaming colors or their bugle-like bursts of music. Is the\r\nwoodpecker\'s drumming, and apparent listening with the side of his\r\nhead turned to the tree, all for fun, and nothing for reward?\r\n\r\n_Birds that feed upon the potato beetle._--The grosbeaks and the\r\ntanagers. Describe these. Why are these and other brightly colored\r\nbirds so shy? What has been the effect of the extensive killing of\r\nthem for ornament, and the equally cruel practice of securing their\r\nyoung to be kept in cages? Note how much more attractive our fields\r\nand gardens would be if these beautiful beings were common in them,\r\nand by their quaint ways were "teaching us manners."\r\n\r\n_Personations of birds._--Ask the children to write "personations" of\r\nbirds, as if the writer were the bird. Give them the following\r\ndirections: Write in the first person. Describe yourself as accurately\r\nas you are able, without telling your name. Tell of your habits and\r\nmanner of life, your summer and winter homes, your home cares--your\r\nnest building, your parental joys and anxieties, the enemies you have\r\nto avoid. Mention at some length the trouble you take to give your\r\nlittle ones a good start in life, and to enable them to earn their own\r\nliving. Describe your songs, and try to indicate why they differ, and\r\nwhat you mean by each one. Try to present a somewhat complete picture\r\nof the bird and its life, from the bird\'s point of view. At the close\r\nof your personation the hearers may vote upon the name of the bird\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nA family of birds may also be described, as if they were persons,--and\r\nare they not? A very fine model of this kind of work is "Our New\r\nNeighbors at Ponkapog," by T. B. Aldrich.\r\n\r\nHave essays written upon the following subjects:--\r\n\r\n     Are there birds that do not sing?\r\n\r\n     What is the attitude of other birds to the owl?\r\n\r\n     Is any country too cold, or any too warm, for birds?\r\n\r\n     Have birds individuality?\r\n\r\n     What is the largest bird of North America?\r\n\r\n     The smallest?\r\n\r\n     What laws has your state made about birds?\r\n\r\n     Ought the "government to own" the birds? (That is, make laws\r\n     for their protection.)\r\n\r\n     Is the blue jay wicked?\r\n\r\n     What birds walk?\r\n\r\n     Do birds travel at night, during their migrations?\r\n\r\nBeginning in March, note for several days the different kinds of birds\r\nyou see, which were not seen the day before. Make at least two\r\nobservations daily, one in the morning and one after school. When is\r\nthe greater number of new birds seen, in the morning or in the\r\nafternoon? Or, if you live in a comparatively quiet neighborhood, even\r\nin a large city, go out at night and listen for bird sounds in the\r\nair. You need not go far to make this trial--your own back door "opens\r\ninto all outdoors."\r\n\r\n     What states have established a Bird Day by law?\r\n\r\n     Is woman cruel or only thoughtless?\r\n\r\n     Do robins raise more than one brood in a season? If so, do\r\n     they use the same nest twice? If they raise two broods, what\r\n     becomes of the first, while the mother is sitting upon the\r\n     eggs for the second?\r\n\r\nWatch for a robin leading out his family. Notice the feeding, after\r\nthe birds are large enough to run and fly fairly well. The young birds\r\nare placed apart, and kept apart by the parent, who visits each one in\r\nturn, and rebukes any who tries to be piggish, sometimes rapping it\r\nwith his bill when it runs out of turn. Notice this parent teaching\r\nthe young to sing. It is a very interesting sight.\r\n\r\n     What birds have you heard sing at night?\r\n\r\nMore birds sing at night than is commonly supposed. The female robin\r\ncalls to her mate frequently during the night, and he responds with a\r\nsong. The catbird also sings at night. Last May one was heard to sing\r\nthree nights in succession from eleven o\'clock until daylight in\r\nresponse to little complaining calls from his mate. The song sparrow,\r\nwarblers, and many other birds sing at night. Their songs at these\r\ntimes sound as if the bird were sleepy and reluctant to sing, or as if\r\nhe were startled and were hurrying through the performance. Make a\r\nnote of songs heard at night and try to determine the cause. Learn to\r\ndistinguish the call of the female from the song of the male.\r\n\r\n_The kinds of nests._--What birds are weavers? What ones are masons or\r\nplasterers? What ones are tailors, in the construction of their nests?\r\n\r\nFind a pair of birds engaged in nest building; robins may generally be\r\nfound. Learn to distinguish the male from the female in appearance, as\r\nwell as voice. Notice what materials they are using. Which bird takes\r\nthe lead in building? What does the other bird do? Does he ever carry\r\nmaterial, or does he simply act as escort? Does he ever protect his\r\nmate from other birds?\r\n\r\nWrite this out, carefully drawing your conclusions from your own\r\nobservations. After the young birds have left the nest and have no\r\nfurther use for it, you may take the nest and examine it closely. You\r\nwill find that while there is a similarity in the nests of the same\r\nkind of birds, they differ considerably in the materials of which they\r\nare composed. For example, the typical robin\'s nest consists of straws\r\nand hairs plastered together with mud and lined with some soft\r\nmaterial, but others have been found made entirely of raveled rope;\r\nothers of carpet rags. The bird evidently is not guided in this matter\r\nby blind instinct, but uses its reason in adapting materials that are\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\nIf you are fortunate you may find a pair of orioles building their\r\nnest. Place some bright-colored yarn or string in pieces of convenient\r\nlength where the birds will see them. Some of them are almost sure to\r\nbe woven into the nest. The oriole\'s nest may be attached to a limb by\r\ntwo or more cords; if it is, notice how it is prevented from swinging\r\nby side ropes. You will find it guyed against the prevailing winds.\r\nThe oriole frequently ties several twigs together, and so uses these\r\nto suspend his nest. Notice the nest pouch; those built near houses\r\nare quite shallow; those near forests are much deeper. Can you tell\r\nwhy?\r\n\r\n_The wings of birds._--Describe the different kinds, as short and\r\nround, or long and slender, and the effect of the wing-shape upon the\r\nbird\'s motion in the air. Describe the flights of different birds.\r\n\r\n_Songs of birds._--Write the syllables which seem to you to express\r\nthe different songs of birds. Notice the different songs of the same\r\nbird. A song sparrow was observed to have twelve different songs. He\r\nsang each one several times over, as if each song had a number of\r\nverses. Then changing his position, he would sing another. To most\r\nears the robin\'s song is always the same, but close attention\r\ndiscovers that there are variations. Many birds are genuine musicians\r\nand compose as they sing, not having formal songs.\r\n\r\n_Free description of birds._--Write description of some bird of your\r\nacquaintance, noting the following:--\r\n\r\n_Its appearance._--Color, gait, flight, size from tip of beak to end\r\nof tail, spread of wings.\r\n\r\n_Its common name._--Why given?\r\n\r\n_Time of arrival and departure._\r\n\r\n_Character._--Is it trustful, or shy and retiring?\r\n\r\n_Song._--Season when song is most frequent, also times of day. Does it\r\nconsist of many or only a few notes? Is it cheery, like the robin\'s,\r\nor tuneful, like the thrush\'s, or rollicking and rapturous, like the\r\nbobolink\'s, or a Romanza, like the catbird\'s? Notice the different\r\nemotion sounds, the notes of fear, of parental or conjugal reprimand,\r\nof joy, of anger, of deep sorrow, made by the bird at times.\r\n\r\n_Food._--Insects (kinds), seeds, fruit, etc.\r\n\r\n_Nest._--Where placed, how made?\r\n\r\n_Incidents._--From the writer\'s knowledge of the bird.\r\n\r\n_This bird in literature._--What writers have described, what poets\r\nhave immortalized him? How did they characterize him?\r\n\r\nSome of the following books are almost indispensable to one who wishes\r\nto know the birds:--\r\n\r\n"Wake Robin," John Burroughs; "Birds and Poets," John Burroughs; "The\r\nBirds and Seasons of New England," Wilson Flagg; "Upland and Meadow,"\r\nCharles C. Abbott; "Bird Ways," Olive Thorne Miller; "Birds through an\r\nOpera Glass," Florence A. Merriam; "Birds in the Bush," Bradford\r\nTorrey; "The Birds About Us," Charles C. Abbott; "From Blomidon to\r\nSmoky," Frank Bolles.\r\n\r\nRecent magazines should be searched and the current ones scrutinized\r\nfor articles by any of the above-named writers.\r\n\r\n_Destruction of birds._--Find out how many birds are annually\r\nslaughtered in the United States, and for what purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the American Ornithologist Union published in 1886,\r\nit was estimated that about five million birds were annually required\r\nto fill the demand for the ornamentation of the hats of the American\r\nwomen. In 1896 it was estimated that the number thus used was ten\r\nmillion. "The slaughter is not confined to song-birds; everything that\r\nwears feathers is a target for the bird butcher. The destruction of\r\n40,000 terns in a single season on Cape Cod, a million rail and reed\r\nbirds (bobolinks) killed in a single month near Philadelphia, are\r\nfacts that may well furnish food for reflection. The swamps and\r\nmarshes of Florida are well known to have become depopulated of their\r\negrets and herons, while the state at large has been for years a\r\nfavorite slaughter ground of the milliners\' emissaries." An article in\r\n_Forest and Stream_, speaking of the destruction of birds on Long\r\nIsland, states that during a short period of four months 20,000 were\r\nsupplied to the New York dealers from a single village.\r\n\r\nThe Audubon Society of Massachusetts has looked up the figures and\r\nreports that "it is proved that into England alone between 25,000,000\r\nand 30,000,000 birds are imported yearly, and that for Europe the\r\nnumber reaches 150,000,000. Hence, the fashionable craze has annually\r\ndemanded between 200,000,000 and 300,000,000 birds. From the East\r\nIndies alone a dealer in London received 400,000 humming birds, 6,000\r\nbirds of paradise, and 400,000 miscellaneous birds. In an auction\r\nroom, also in London, within four months, over 800,000 East and West\r\nIndian and Brazilian bird skins, besides thousands of pheasants and\r\nbirds of paradise, were put up for sale."\r\n\r\nThis demand for birds has been going on for a quarter of a century,\r\nand billions of rich-plumaged creatures have been slaughtered to meet\r\nit, and several of the feathered tribes have been exterminated.\r\n\r\nWrite to the following for literature upon the destruction of birds:--\r\n\r\nHumane Education Committee, 61 Westminster Street, Providence, R. I.;\r\nGeorge T. Angell, Boston, Mass.; Secretary of the Massachusetts\r\nAudubon Society, Boston, Mass.; Secretary of the New York Audubon\r\nSociety at New York; Secretary of the Department of Agriculture,\r\nWashington, D. C.; Secretary of the Audubon Society of Pennsylvania at\r\nPhiladelphia; also write to the Department of Agriculture of your own\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nPROGRAMS FOR BIRD DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nA Bird Day exercise, in order to have much value educationally, should\r\nbe largely the result of the pupils\' previous work, and should not be\r\nthe mere repetition of a prepared program taken verbatim from some\r\npaper or leaflet. It is, of course, better to have the pupils recite\r\nthis leaflet or list of statements than it would be to have it ground\r\nout of a phonograph. The program should be prepared by the pupils\r\nunder direction of the teacher.\r\n\r\nThe following general suggestions are offered:--\r\n\r\n1. For the first observance of this day by a school it would be well\r\nto have some pupil read Senator Hoar\'s petition of the birds to the\r\nLegislature of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nPETITION OF THE BIRDS\r\n\r\n_Written by Senator Hoar to the Massachusetts Legislature_\r\n\r\nThe petition which was instrumental in getting the Massachusetts law\r\npassed, prohibiting the wearing of song and insectivorous birds on\r\nwomen\'s hats, was written by Senator Hoar. The petition read as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     To the Great and General Court of the Commonwealth of\r\n     Massachusetts: We, the song birds of Massachusetts and their\r\n     playfellows, make this our humble petition. We know more\r\n     about you than you think we do. We know how good you are. We\r\n     have hopped about the roofs and looked in at your windows of\r\n     the houses you have built for poor and sick and hungry\r\n     people, and little lame and deaf and blind children. We have\r\n     built our nests in the trees and sung many a song as we flew\r\n     about the gardens and parks you have made so beautiful for\r\n     your children, especially your poor children to play in.\r\n     Every year we fly a great way over the country, keeping all\r\n     the time where the sun is bright and warm. And we know that\r\n     whenever you do anything the other people all over this\r\n     great land between the seas and the Great Lakes find it out,\r\n     and pretty soon will try to do the same. We know. We know.\r\n\r\n     We are Americans just the same as you are. Some of us, like\r\n     you, came across the great sea. But most of the birds like\r\n     us have lived here a long while; and the birds like us\r\n     welcomed your fathers when they came here many, many years\r\n     ago. Our fathers and mothers have always done their best to\r\n     please your fathers and mothers.\r\n\r\n     Now we have a sad story to tell you. Thoughtless or bad\r\n     people are trying to destroy us. They kill us because our\r\n     feathers are beautiful. Even pretty and sweet girls, who we\r\n     should think would be our best friends, kill our brothers\r\n     and children so that they may wear our plumage on their\r\n     hats. Sometimes people kill us for mere wantonness. Cruel\r\n     boys destroy our nests and steal our eggs and our young\r\n     ones. People with guns and snares lie in wait to kill us; as\r\n     if the place for a bird were not in the sky, alive, but in a\r\n     shop window or in a glass case. If this goes on much longer\r\n     all our song birds will be gone. Already we are told in some\r\n     other countries that used to be full of birds, they are now\r\n     almost gone. Even the nightingales are being killed in\r\n     Italy.\r\n\r\n     Now we humbly pray that you will stop all this and will save\r\n     us from this sad fate. You have already made a law that no\r\n     one shall kill a harmless song bird or destroy our nests or\r\n     our eggs. Will you please make another one that no one shall\r\n     wear our feathers, so that no one shall kill us to get them?\r\n     We want them all ourselves. Your pretty girls are pretty\r\n     enough without them. We are told that it is as easy for you\r\n     to do it as for a blackbird to whistle.\r\n\r\n     If you will, we know how to pay you a hundred times over. We\r\n     will teach your children to keep themselves clean and neat.\r\n     We will show them how to live together in peace and love and\r\n     to agree as we do in our nests. We will build pretty houses\r\n     which you will like to see. We will play about your garden\r\n     and flower beds--ourselves like flowers on wings, without\r\n     any cost to you. We will destroy the wicked insects and\r\n     worms that spoil your cherries and currants and plums and\r\n     apples and roses. We will give you our best songs, and make\r\n     the spring more beautiful and the summer sweeter to you.\r\n     Every June morning when you go out into the field, oriole\r\n     and bluebird and blackbird and bobolink will fly after you\r\n     and make the day more delightful to you. And when you go\r\n     home tired after sundown, vesper sparrow will tell you how\r\n     grateful we are. When you sit down on your porch after dark,\r\n     fifebird and hermit thrush and wood thrush will sing to you;\r\n     and even whip-poor-will will cheer you up a little. We know\r\n     where we are safe. In a little while all the birds will come\r\n     to live in Massachusetts again, and everybody who loves\r\n     music will like to make a summer home with you.\r\n\r\nThe signers are:--\r\n\r\nBrown Thrasher,\r\nRobert o\' Lincoln,\r\nHermit Thrush,\r\nVesper Sparrow,\r\nRobin Redbreast,\r\nSong Sparrow,\r\nScarlet Tanager,\r\nSummer Redbird,\r\nBlue Heron,\r\nHumming Bird,\r\nYellowbird,\r\nWhip-poor-will,\r\nWater Wagtail,\r\nWoodpecker,\r\nPigeon Woodpecker,\r\nIndigo Bird,\r\nYellowthroat,\r\nWilson\'s Thrush,\r\nChickadee,\r\nKingbird,\r\nSwallow,\r\nCedar Bird,\r\nCowbird,\r\nMartin,\r\nVeery,\r\nChewink,\r\nVireo,\r\nOriole,\r\nBlackbird,\r\nFifebird,\r\nWren,\r\nLinnet,\r\nPewee,\r\nPhoebe,\r\nYoke Bird,\r\nLark,\r\nSandpiper.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the result of this petition was the passage of\r\na law by the Legislature of Massachusetts forbidding the wearing of\r\nparts of wild birds. A bill forbidding the transportation of feathers\r\nor the skins of birds from one state to another was also introduced by\r\nSenator Hoar in the United States Senate.\r\n\r\n2. At this first exercise it would be well to have read "Our New\r\nNeighbors at Ponkapog," by T. B. Aldrich.\r\n\r\n3. The best essays that have been written by the pupils during their\r\npreliminary study may be given. If the school has not made this\r\npreliminary study, select subjects and have essays written according\r\nto the directions already given, allowing as much time as possible for\r\noriginal observations.\r\n\r\n4. Have recitations from the poets. These will add a peculiar charm to\r\nthe occasion. A short list of suitable poems will be given. Many\r\nothers may be found in a book called "Voices of the Speechless,"\r\npublished by Houghton, Mifflin & Co.\r\n\r\nThe works of John Burroughs, Bradford Torrey, Maurice Thompson, Mrs.\r\nOlive Thorne Miller, and Dr. C. C. Abbott abound in passages which are\r\nexcellent for recitation. It is surprising how familiar the best-known\r\nnovelists have been and are with birds. In appreciation of them they\r\nare second only to the poets. Charles Reade\'s description of the\r\nlark\'s song in the mines of Australia, in "Never Too Late to Mend," is\r\nan inspiring recitation.\r\n\r\n5. Short quotations from well known authors should be given, if\r\npossible, by every pupil in the school. We give a few taken almost at\r\nrandom:--\r\n\r\n     Away over the hayfield the lark floated in the blue, making\r\n     the air quiver with his singing; the robin, perched on a\r\n     fence, looked at us saucily and piped a few notes by way of\r\n     remark; the blackbird was heard, flute-throated, down in the\r\n     hollow recesses of the wood; and the thrush, in a holly tree\r\n     by the wayside, sang out his sweet, clear song that seemed\r\n     to rise in strength as the wind awoke a sudden rustling\r\n     through the long woods of birch and oak.--WILLIAM BLACK, in\r\n     _Adventures of a Phaeton_.\r\n\r\n     We seemed to hear all the sounds within a great compass--in\r\n     the hedges and in the roadside trees, far away in woods or\r\n     hidden up in the level grayness of the clouds: twi, twi,\r\n     trrrr-weet!--droom, droom, phloee!--tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck,\r\n     feer!--that was the silvery chorus from thousands of\r\n     throats. It seemed to us that all the fields and hedges had\r\n     but one voice, and that it was clear and sweet and\r\n     piercing.--WILLIAM BLACK, _Ibid._\r\n\r\n     Silvia could hear the twittering of the young starlings in\r\n     their nests as their parents went and came carrying food,\r\n     and the loud and joyful "tirr-a-wee, tirr-a-wee, prooit,\r\n     tweet!" of the thrushes, and the low currooing of the wood\r\n     pigeon, and the soft call of the cuckoo, that seemed to come\r\n     in whenever an interval of silence fitted. The swallows\r\n     dipped and flashed and circled over the bosom of the lake.\r\n     There were blackbirds eagerly but cautiously at work, with\r\n     their spasmodic trippings, on the lawn. A robin perched on\r\n     the iron railing eyed her curiously and seemed more disposed\r\n     to approach than to retreat.--WILLIAM BLACK, in _Green\r\n     Pastures and Piccadilly_.\r\n\r\n     A jay fled screaming through the wood, just one brief\r\n     glimpse of brilliant blue being visible.--WILLIAM BLACK,\r\n     _Ibid._\r\n\r\n     And as they came near to one dark patch of shrubbery, lo!\r\n     the strange silence was burst asunder by the rich, full song\r\n     of a nightingale.--WILLIAM BLACK, _Ibid._\r\n\r\n     A sudden sound sprang into the night, flooding all its\r\n     darkness with its rich and piercing melody--a joyous, clear,\r\n     full-throated note, deep-gurgling now, and again rising with\r\n     thrills and tremors into bursts of far-reaching silver song\r\n     that seemed to shake the hollow air. A single nightingale\r\n     had filled the woods with life. We cared no more for those\r\n     distant and silent stars. It was enough to sit here in the\r\n     gracious quiet and listen to the eager tremulous outpouring\r\n     of this honeyed sound.--WILLIAM BLACK, in _Strange\r\n     Adventures of a House-Boat_.\r\n\r\n     Shoot and eat my birds! The next step beyond, and one would\r\n     hanker after Jenny Lind or Miss Kellogg.--HENRY WARD\r\n     BEECHER.\r\n\r\n     There on the very topmost twig, that rises and falls with\r\n     willowy motion, sits that ridiculous, sweet-singing\r\n     bobolink, singing as a Roman candle fizzes, showers of\r\n     sparkling notes.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\nThis poet affirms that our bobolink is superior to the nightingale:--\r\n\r\n    Bobolink, that in the meadow,\r\n    Or beneath the orchard\'s shadow,\r\n    Keepest up a constant rattle\r\n    Joyous as my children\'s prattle,\r\n    Welcome to the North again,\r\n    Welcome to mine ear thy strain,\r\n    Welcome to mine eye the sight\r\n    Of thy buff, thy black and white.\r\n    Brighter plumes may greet the sun\r\n    By the banks of Amazon;\r\n    Sweeter tones may weave the spell\r\n    Of enchanting Philomel;\r\n    But the tropic bird would fail,\r\n    And the English nightingale,\r\n    If we should compare their worth\r\n    With thine endless, gushing mirth.\r\n\r\n--THOMAS HILL.\r\n\r\n     The mocking bird is a singer that has suffered much from its\r\n     powers of mimicry. On ordinary occasions, and especially in\r\n     the daytime, it insists on playing the harlequin. But when\r\n     free in its own favorite haunts at night, it has a song, or\r\n     rather songs, which are not only purely original, but are\r\n     also more beautiful than any other bird music whatsoever.\r\n     Once I listened to a mocking bird singing the livelong\r\n     spring night, under the full moon, in a magnolia tree; and I\r\n     do not think I shall ever forget its song.\r\n\r\n     The great tree was bathed in a flood of shining silver; I\r\n     could see each twig, and mark every action of the singer,\r\n     who was pouring forth such a rapture of ringing melody as I\r\n     have never listened to before or since. Sometimes he would\r\n     perch motionless for many minutes, his body quivering and\r\n     thrilling with the outpour of music. Then he would drop\r\n     softly from twig to twig till the lowest limb was reached,\r\n     when he would rise, fluttering and leaping through the\r\n     branches, his song never ceasing for an instant until he\r\n     reached the summit of the tree and launched into the warm\r\n     scent-laden air, floating in spirals, with outspread wings,\r\n     until, as if spent, he sank gently back into the tree and\r\n     down through the branches, while his song rose into an\r\n     ecstasy of ardor and passion. His voice rang like a\r\n     clarionet in rich, full tones, and his execution covered the\r\n     widest possible compass; theme followed theme, a torrent of\r\n     music, a swelling tide of harmony, in which scarcely any two\r\n     bars were alike. I stayed till midnight listening to him; he\r\n     was singing when I went to sleep; he was still singing when\r\n     I woke a couple of hours later; he sang through the livelong\r\n     night.--THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n     Amid the thunders of Sinai God uttered the rights of cattle,\r\n     and said that they should have a Sabbath. "Thou shalt not do\r\n     any work, thou, nor thy cattle." He declared with infinite\r\n     emphasis that the ox on the threshing-floor should have the\r\n     privilege of eating some of the grain as he trod it out, and\r\n     muzzling was forbidden. If young birds were taken from the\r\n     nest for food, the despoiler\'s life depended on the mother\r\n     going free. God would not let the mother-bird suffer in one\r\n     day the loss of her young and her own liberty. And he who\r\n     regarded in olden time the conduct of man toward the brutes,\r\n     to-day looks down from heaven and is interested in every\r\n     minnow that swims the stream, and every rook that cleaves\r\n     the air.--DEWITT TALMAGE, D.D.\r\n\r\n     And how refreshing is the sight of the birdless bonnet! The\r\n     face beneath, no matter how plain it may be, seems to\r\n     possess a gentle charm. She might have had birds, this\r\n     woman, for they are cheap enough and plentiful enough,\r\n     heaven knows; but she has them not, therefore she must wear\r\n     within things infinitely precious, namely, good sense, good\r\n     taste, good feeling. Does any woman imagine these withered\r\n     corpses (cured with arsenic), which she loves to carry\r\n     about, are beautiful? Not so; the birds lost their beauty\r\n     with their lives.--CELIA THAXTER.\r\n\r\n     I walked up my garden path as I was coming home from\r\n     shooting. My dog ran on before me; suddenly he went slower\r\n     and crept carefully forward as if he scented game. I looked\r\n     along the path and perceived a young sparrow, with its downy\r\n     head and yellow bill. It had fallen from a nest (the wind\r\n     was blowing hard through the young birch trees beside the\r\n     path) and was sprawling motionless, helpless, on the ground,\r\n     with its little wings outspread. My dog crept softly up to\r\n     it, when suddenly an old black-breasted sparrow threw\r\n     himself down from a neighboring tree and let himself fall\r\n     like a stone directly under the dog\'s nose, and, with\r\n     ruffled feathers, sprang with a terrified twitter several\r\n     times against his open, threatening mouth. He had flown down\r\n     to protect his young at the sacrifice of himself. His little\r\n     body trembled all over, his cry was hoarse, he was\r\n     frightened to death; but he sacrificed himself. My dog must\r\n     have seemed to him a gigantic monster, but for all that, he\r\n     could not stay on his high, safe branch. A power stronger\r\n     than himself drove him down. My dog stopped and drew back;\r\n     it seemed as if he, too, respected this power. I hastened to\r\n     call back the amazed dog, and reverently withdrew. Yes,\r\n     don\'t laugh; I felt a reverence for this little hero of a\r\n     bird, with his paternal love.\r\n\r\n     Love, thought I, is mightier than death and the fear of\r\n     death; love alone inspires and is the life of all.--IVAN\r\n     TOURGUENEFF.\r\n\r\n     The first sparrow of spring! The year beginning with younger\r\n     hope than ever! The faint, silvery warblings heard over the\r\n     partially bare and moist fields from the bluebird, the song\r\n     sparrow, and the redwing, as if the last flakes of winter\r\n     tinkled as they fell!--H. D. THOREAU.\r\n\r\n     I heard a robin in the distance, the first I had heard for\r\n     many a thousand years, methought, whose note I shall not\r\n     forget for many a thousand more,--the same sweet, powerful\r\n     song as of yore.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n     Walden is melting apace. A great field of ice has cracked\r\n     off from the main body. I hear a song sparrow from the\r\n     bushes on the shore,--_olit, olit, olit--chip, chip, chip,\r\n     che char--che wis, wis, wis_. He, too, is helping to crack\r\n     the ice.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n     The bluebird carries the sky on his back.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n6. One of the most interesting features of a Bird Day program will be\r\nthe personations of birds.\r\n\r\nThe following was given by a boy in the seventh grade:--\r\n\r\n     One day in February a gentleman and his wife stopped beside\r\n     the wall of old Fort Marion, in St. Augustine, to listen to\r\n     my song. The sun was shining brightly, and little white\r\n     flowers were blooming in the green turf about the old fort.\r\n     It was not time yet to build my nest, so I had nothing to do\r\n     but sing and get my food and travel a little every day\r\n     toward my Northern home.\r\n\r\n     I am about as large as a robin, and although there is\r\n     nothing brilliant in my plumage I am not a homely bird. I\r\n     like the songs of other birds and sometimes sing them. I\r\n     frequently sing like my cousins, the catbirds and robins and\r\n     thrushes. But I have my own song, which is unlike all the\r\n     others. My mate and I build a large nest of small sticks,\r\n     pieces of string, cotton, and weeds, in thick bushes or low\r\n     trees. We have five eggs that are greenish blue and spotted\r\n     with brown. We eat many beetles, larv\xc3\xa6, and many kinds of\r\n     insects which we find feeding upon plants. The worst enemy\r\n     we have is man. He steals our children almost before we have\r\n     taught them to sing, and puts them in cages. He is a\r\n     monster.\r\n\r\n     Many poems have been written about me. One of the finest is\r\n     by Sidney Lanier, in which he calls me "yon trim Shakespeare\r\n     on the tree."\r\n\r\n     Any one who has heard my song can never forget me.\r\n\r\n     What is my name?\r\n\r\n7. Bird facts and proverbs form a valuable part of a program and may\r\nbe given by some of the children. Let the pupils search for them and\r\nbring some similar to these:--\r\n\r\n     Birds flock together in hard times.\r\n\r\n     A bird in the bush is worth two in the hand.\r\n\r\n     The American robin is not the same bird as the English.\r\n\r\n     The bluebird and robin may be harbingers of spring, but the\r\n     swallow is the harbinger of summer.\r\n\r\n     The dandelion tells me to look for the swallow; the\r\n     dog-toothed violet when to expect the wood thrush.--JOHN\r\n     BURROUGHS.\r\n\r\n     It is not thought that any one bird spends the year in one\r\n     locality, but that all birds migrate, if only within a\r\n     limited range.\r\n\r\n     A loon was caught, by a set line for fishing, sixty-five\r\n     feet below the surface of a lake in New York, having dived\r\n     to that depth for a fish.\r\n\r\n     The wood pewee, like its relative, the phoebe, feeds\r\n     largely on the family of flies to which the house fly\r\n     belongs.\r\n\r\n     The birds of prey, the majority of which labor night and day\r\n     to destroy the enemies of the husbandman, are unceasingly\r\n     persecuted.\r\n\r\n     Seventy-five per cent of the food of the downy woodpecker is\r\n     insects.\r\n\r\n     The cow blackbird lays its eggs in other birds\' nests, one\r\n     in a nest. What happens afterwards?\r\n\r\n     Why should not a man love a bird? If the palm of one could\r\n     clasp the pinion of the other, there would come together two\r\n     of the greatest implements God and nature have ever given\r\n     any two creatures to explore the world with, and when two\r\n     bipeds gaze at each other, eye to eye, the intelligence in\r\n     the one might well take off its hat to the subtle instincts\r\n     in the other.--JAMES NEWTON BASKETT.\r\n\r\n     A bird on the bonnet means so much less bread on the table.\r\n     A bird in the orchard is a sort of scavenger and pomologist\r\n     combined, and does his share in giving you a dish of fruit\r\n     for dinner. The scarlet tanager looks like a living ruby in\r\n     a green tree; but--I speak bluntly--it looks like a chunk of\r\n     gore on a woman\'s bonnet. In behalf of good taste and the\r\n     birds, I enter my protest against this barbarous\r\n     Custom.--LEANDER T. KEYSER.\r\n\r\n    What does it cost, this garniture of death?\r\n      It costs the life which God alone can give;\r\n    It costs dull silence, where was music\'s breath;\r\n      It costs dead joy, that foolish pride may live.\r\n    Ah, life, and joy, and song, depend upon it,\r\n    Are costly trimmings for a woman\'s bonnet.\r\n\r\n--MAY RILEY SMITH.\r\n\r\nThe program may be diversified by songs about birds. Many suitable for\r\nthis occasion will be found in a collection called "Songs of Happy\r\nLife," made by Sarah J. Eddy. It is published by the Nature Study\r\nPublishing Company, of Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE POETS AND THE BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\n"The birds are the poets\' own," says Burroughs. How could it be\r\notherwise? The bird, with his large brain, quick circulation, and high\r\ntemperature, is possessed of a tropical, ecstatic soul that blossoms\r\ninto music as naturally as a bulb bursts into bloom and fragrance. He\r\nis a creature of marvelous inheritance. Poetry is a true bird-land,\r\nwhere you shall hear the birds as often as in any meadow or orchard on\r\na May morning. All poets have been their lovers, from the psalmist of\r\nold, who knew "all the birds of the mountains," to our own Lowell with\r\nhis "Gladness on wings--the bobolink is here."\r\n\r\nThe poets, who voice our deepest thoughts, have studied birds with the\r\nutmost care. It is astonishing to note the mention made of them in the\r\npages of Browning, Tennyson, and in fact of every great maker of\r\nverse. Not merely as adjuncts of the landscape are they mentioned, but\r\nwith intensity of feeling, as in William Watson\'s poem on his recovery\r\nfrom temporary loss of mind--one of the most pathetic poems ever\r\nwritten--where he thanks the Heavenly Power for letting him feel once\r\nagain at home in nature and again related to the birds and to human\r\nlife. Dr. Van Dyke\'s wish that, when his twilight hour is come, he\r\n"may hear the wood note of the veery" finds response in the heart of\r\nevery one who has listened to that song. Frequently the poet seems to\r\nhave entered into the life of the bird and to have found his inner\r\nsecret, as Keats in the "Ode to a Nightingale":--\r\n\r\n    Immortal bird, thou wast not born for death,\r\n    No hungry generations tread thee down.\r\n\r\nSometimes the words seem to have caught the rhythm and ripple of the\r\nsong, as in Browning\'s reference to the thrush:--\r\n\r\n    The wise thrush, he sings each song twice over,\r\n    Lest you think he never could recapture\r\n    That first fine careless rapture.\r\n\r\nOr the bird\'s voice may be so suggestive as to lead the seer to the\r\nvery limits of thought and aspiration, like Shelley\'s "Skylark." As we\r\nneed the help of the naturalists, who see more accurately than we, we\r\nalso need the assistance of the poet\'s clearer vision, with its wider\r\nand deeper sweep. How completely Sidney Lanier summed up the mocking\r\nbird! and how much more pleasing is the bird in the tree because of\r\nthe bird in the poem:--\r\n\r\n    Superb and sole, upon a plum\xc3\xa8d spray\r\n    That o\'er the general leafage boldly grew,\r\n    He summed the woods in song; or typic drew\r\n    The watch of hungry hawks, the lone dismay\r\n    Of languid doves when long their lovers stray,\r\n    And all birds\' passion plays that sprinkle dew\r\n    At morn in brake or bosky avenue.\r\n    Whate\'er birds did or dreamed, this bird could say.\r\n    Then down he shot, bounced airily along\r\n    The sward, twitched in a grasshopper, made song\r\n    Midflight, perched, prinked, and to his art again.\r\n    Sweet science, this large riddle read me plain:--\r\n    How may the death of that dull insect be\r\n    The life of yon trim Shakespeare on the tree?\r\n\r\nRecitations from the poets should be a prominent feature of Bird Day\r\nexercises. Readings and studies of poems about birds may be very\r\nprofitably made a part of the literary work of the year.\r\n\r\nThe following poems are suitable for recitation and study:--\r\n\r\n"The Birds\' Orchestra," Celia Thaxter; "The Robin," Celia Thaxter;\r\n"The Song Sparrow," Celia Thaxter; "The Blackbird," Alice Cary; "The\r\nRaven\'s Shadow," William Watson; "On Seeing a Wild Bird," Alice Cary;\r\n"What Sees the Owl?"

The scattered interests of the\r\nchildren would thus be brought together, and fused into a large and\r\ncompact enthusiasm, which would become the common property of all.\r\nZeal in a genuine cause is more contagious than a bad habit.\r\n\r\nThe first Bird Day in the schools was celebrated on the first Friday\r\nin May, 1894. This is as good a date as any for the sections not in\r\nthe extreme North or South.\r\n\r\nIt would better come a little after the birds begin to arrive. The\r\nafternoon session will be found sufficient to devote to the special\r\nexercises. The date should be announced some time beforehand, so that\r\nthe children may prepare for it. They will not only prepare\r\nthemselves, but will have the whole community aroused by the sharp\r\npoints of their inquisitorial weapons. Exercises should be held in all\r\ngrades, from the primary to the high school.\r\n\r\nWe quote the following from circular No. 17 sent out by the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture:--\r\n\r\nOBJECT OF BIRD DAY\r\n\r\n     From all sides come reports of a decrease in native birds,\r\n     due to the clearing of the forests, draining of the swamps,\r\n     and cultivation of lands, but especially to the increasing\r\n     slaughter of birds for game, the demand for feathers to\r\n     supply the millinery trade, and the breaking up of nests to\r\n     gratify the egg-collecting proclivities of small boys. An\r\n     attempt has been made to restrict these latter causes by\r\n     legislation. Nearly every State and Territory has passed\r\n     game laws, and several States have statutes protecting\r\n     insectivorous birds. Such laws are frequently changed and\r\n     cannot be expected to accomplish much unless supported by\r\n     popular sentiment in favor of bird protection. This object\r\n     can only be attained by demonstrating to the people the\r\n     value of birds, and how can it be accomplished better than\r\n     through the medium of the schools?\r\n\r\n     Briefly stated, the object of Bird Day is to diffuse\r\n     knowledge concerning our native birds and to arouse a more\r\n     general interest in bird protection. As such it should\r\n     appeal not only to ornithologists, sportsmen, and farmers,\r\n     who have a practical interest in the preservation of birds,\r\n     but also to the general public, who would soon appreciate\r\n     the loss if the common songsters were exterminated.\r\n\r\n     It is time to give more intelligent attention to the birds\r\n     and appreciate their value. Many schools already have\r\n     courses in natural history or nature study, and such a day\r\n     would add zest to the regular studies, encourage the pupils\r\n     to observe carefully, and give them something to look\r\n     forward to and work for. In the words of the originator of\r\n     the day, "the general observance of a Bird Day in our\r\n     schools would probably do more to open thousands of young\r\n     minds to the reception of bird lore than anything else that\r\n     can be devised." The first thing is to interest the scholars\r\n     in birds in general and particularly in those of their own\r\n     locality. Good lists of birds have been prepared for several\r\n     of the States, and popular books and articles on ornithology\r\n     are within the reach of every one. But the instruction\r\n     should not be limited to books; the children should be\r\n     encouraged to observe the birds in the field, to study their\r\n     habits and migrations, their nests and food, and should be\r\n     taught to respect the laws protecting game and song birds.\r\n\r\nVALUE OF BIRD DAY\r\n\r\n     When the question of introducing Arbor Day into the schools\r\n     was brought before the National Educational Association in\r\n     February, 1884, the objection was made that the subject was\r\n     out of place in the schools. The value of the innovation\r\n     could not be appreciated by those who did not see the\r\n     practical bearing of the subject on an ordinary school\r\n     course. But at the next meeting of the Association the\r\n     question was again brought up and unanimously adopted--to\r\n     the mutual benefit of the schools and of practical forestry.\r\n     With the advent of more progressive ideas concerning\r\n     education there is a demand for instruction in subjects\r\n     which a few years ago would have been considered out of\r\n     place, or of no special value. If the main object of our\r\n     educational system is to prepare boys and girls for the\r\n     intelligent performance of the duties and labors of life,\r\n     why should not some attention be given to the study of\r\n     nature, particularly in rural schools where the farmers of\r\n     the next generation are now being educated?\r\n\r\n     The study of birds may be taken up in several ways and for\r\n     different purposes; it may be made to furnish simply a\r\n     course in mental training or to assist the pupil in\r\n     acquiring habits of accurate observation; it may be taken up\r\n     alone or combined with composition, drawing, geography, or\r\n     literature. But it has also an economic side which may\r\n     appeal to those who demand purely practical studies in\r\n     schools. Economic ornithology has been defined as the "study\r\n     of birds from the standpoint of dollars and cents." It\r\n     treats of the direct relations of birds to man, showing\r\n     which species are beneficial and which injurious, teaching\r\n     the agriculturist how to protect his feathered friends and\r\n     guard against the attacks of his foes. This is a subject in\r\n     which we are only just beginning to acquire exact knowledge,\r\n     but it is none the less deserving of a place in our\r\n     educational system on this account. Its practical value is\r\n     recognized both by individual States and by the National\r\n     Government, which appropriate considerable sums of money for\r\n     investigations of value to agriculture. Much good work has\r\n     been done by some of the experiment stations and State\r\n     boards of agriculture, particularly in Illinois, Indiana,\r\n     Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania. In the\r\n     United States Department of Agriculture, the Division of\r\n     Biological Survey (formerly the Division of Ornithology)\r\n     devotes much attention to the collection of data respecting\r\n     the geographic distribution, migration, and food of birds,\r\n     and to the publication and diffusion of information\r\n     concerning species which are beneficial or injurious to\r\n     agriculture. Some of the results of these investigations are\r\n     of general interest, and could be used in courses of\r\n     instruction in even the lower schools. Such facts would thus\r\n     reach a larger number of persons than is now possible, and\r\n     would be made more generally available to those interested\r\n     in them.\r\n\r\n     If illustrations of the practical value of a knowledge of\r\n     zo\xc3\xb6logy are necessary they can easily be given. It has been\r\n     estimated recently that the forests and streams of Maine are\r\n     worth more than its agricultural resources. If this is so,\r\n     is it not equally as important to teach the best means of\r\n     preserving the timber, the game, and the fish, as it is to\r\n     teach students how to develop the agricultural wealth of the\r\n     State? In 1885 Pennsylvania passed its famous "scalp act,"\r\n     and in less than two years expended between $75,000 and\r\n     $100,000 in an attempt to rid the State of animals and birds\r\n     supposed to be injurious. A large part of the money was\r\n     spent for killing hawks and owls, most of which belonged to\r\n     species which were afterwards shown to be actually\r\n     beneficial. Not only was money thrown away in a useless war\r\n     against noxious animals, but the State actually paid for the\r\n     destruction of birds of inestimable value to its farmers.\r\n     During the last five or six years two States have been\r\n     engaged in an unsuccessful attempt to exterminate English\r\n     sparrows by paying bounties for their heads. Michigan and\r\n     Illinois have each spent more than $50,000; but, although\r\n     millions of sparrows have been killed, the decrease in\r\n     numbers is hardly perceptible. A more general knowledge of\r\n     the habits of the English sparrow at the time the bird was\r\n     first introduced into the United States would not only have\r\n     saved this outlay of over $100,000, but would also have\r\n     saved many other States from loss due to depredations by\r\n     sparrows.\r\n\r\n     Is it not worth while to do something to protect the birds\r\n     and prevent their destruction before it is too late? A\r\n     powerful influence for good can be exerted by the schools if\r\n     the teachers will only interest themselves in the movement,\r\n     and the benefit that will result to the pupils could hardly\r\n     be attained in any other way at so small an expenditure of\r\n     time. If it is deemed unwise to establish another holiday,\r\n     or it may seem too much to devote one day in the year to the\r\n     study of birds, the exercises of Bird Day might be combined\r\n     with those of Arbor Day.\r\n\r\n     It is believed that Bird Day can be adopted with profit by\r\n     schools of all grades, and the subject is recommended to the\r\n     thoughtful attention of teachers and school superintendents\r\n     throughout the country, in the hope that they will co\xc3\xb6perate\r\n     with other agencies now at work to prevent the destruction\r\n     of our native birds.\r\n\r\nT. S. PALMER,\r\n\r\n_Acting Chief of Division_.\r\n\r\nApproved:\r\n\r\nCHAS. W. DABNEY, JR.,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., July 2, 1896.\r\n\r\nThe results of Bird Day are noticeable in the schools in which it has\r\nbeen observed. The spirit of the schools has become fresher and\r\nbrighter. There has been more marked improvement in the composition\r\nwork and in the language of the pupils. Most of the children know the\r\nnames of many of our birds and considerable of their ways of life, and\r\nwish to know more, and are their warm friends and protectors. The old\r\nrelations between the small boy and the birds have been entirely\r\nchanged. The birds themselves have been affected. They have become\r\nmuch more numerous. Many that were formerly rare visitants now nest\r\nfreely in the shade trees of the city; for example, the orioles, the\r\ngrosbeaks, the scarlet tanagers, and even the wood thrushes, and their\r\nnests are about as safe as the other homes. The children say that the\r\nbirds know about Bird Day, and have come to help it along.\r\n\r\nThe correlation of the public library and the public schools is\r\nassured in those towns where Bird Day has been introduced. If there\r\nwere no other result of this new day, the demand for healthful\r\nliterature would be enough. The call for Burroughs and Bradford\r\nTorrey, Olive Thorne Miller, and the other writers of our out-of-doors\r\nliterature is so great as to attract attention in the libraries. In\r\nfact, in one the writer knows well there is a constant and steady\r\ndemand, particularly from the boys. Frank Bolles is a great favorite\r\nwith them. The excursions to the woods have a new and \xc3\xa6sthetic\r\ninterest. What would Emerson have thought when he wrote that matchless\r\nbit--\r\n\r\n    Hast thou named all the birds, without a gun?\r\n    Loved the wood-rose and left it on its stalk?\r\n\r\nif he had known that the boys of another generation would be able to\r\nanswer as he would have liked to have them!\r\n\r\nThe effect upon teachers is not less marked. The trip to the woods in\r\nthe early morning and at sunset, sometimes with the children and\r\nsometimes in parties by themselves, has resulted in physical and\r\nmental good. A new and charming relation has sprung up between\r\nteachers and children. The tie of community of interests is a strong\r\none. A taste in common is always conducive to friendship.\r\n\r\nThe surprising thing about this new departure in nature study is that\r\nonce taken up it will never be abandoned. There is something\r\nfascinating in it. One may love trees and flowers, but their processes\r\nand habits of growth are in a way unrelated to us; but our "little\r\nbrothers in feathers" are kin to us in their hopes and fears.\r\n\r\n"When I think," said a bright woman the other day, "that this summer I\r\nhave learned to know by plumage and by song twenty birds, and when I\r\nrealize the delight the knowledge has given me, I feel as if I ought\r\nto go out as a missionary to the heathen women in my neighborhood."\r\nShe did not exaggerate the feeling of every bird lover. So much is\r\nlost to life and good cheer by this ignorance.\r\n\r\nNow that the Bird Day idea is being taken up and spread by the United\r\nStates Government in the interests of economy, it will do much to\r\nsweeten the lives of the coming generation. The natural impulse to\r\nlove and watch the birds will be encouraged instead of being\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\n    Hast thou named all the birds, without a gun?\r\n    Loved the wood-rose, and left it on its stalk?\r\n    O, be my friend, and teach me to be thine!\r\n\r\n--EMERSON.\r\n\r\n    No longer now the winged inhabitants\r\n    That in the woods their sweet lives sing away,\r\n    Flee from the form of man, but gather round,\r\n    And prune their feathers on the hands\r\n    Which little children stretch in friendly sport\r\n    Towards these dreadless partners of their play.\r\n\r\n--_Extract from_ SHELLEY\'S _Queen Mab_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nNOTES ON REPRESENTATIVE BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKINGBIRD (_Tyrannus tyrannus_)\r\n\r\nCALLED ALSO BEE BIRD, BEE MARTIN, AND TYRANT FLYCATCHER\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, about eight and one-half inches; spread of wings, fourteen and\r\none-half inches. The upper parts of body are a blackish ash; top of\r\nhead, black; crown with a concealed patch of orange red; lower parts\r\npure white, tinged with pale bluish ash on the sides of the throat and\r\nacross the breast; sides of the breast and under the wings rather\r\nlighter than the back; the wings dark brown, darkest towards the ends\r\nof the quills; upper surface of the tail glossy black, the feathers\r\ntipped with white.\r\n\r\nThis bird is a common summer resident of the Middle States, where it\r\nusually arrives the last of April. The name _tyrannus_ given to it is\r\ndescriptive of the character of the male, since during the breeding\r\nseason he is anxious to attack everything wearing feathers. His\r\nparticular aversion is hawks and crows, which he assails by mounting\r\nabove his adversary and making repeated and violent assaults upon his\r\nhead. He will even drive the eagle from his vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe farmer could have no better protection for his corn fields than\r\nthe near-by nest of a pair of kingbirds. They eat some honeybees, but\r\nfor every bee thus taken they destroy ten noxious insects. They can be\r\neasily frightened away from the vicinity of the hives without being\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nThe kingbird\'s nest is made of slender twigs, weed stalks, and\r\ngrasses, and is placed among the branches of trees, fifteen to\r\ntwenty-five feet from the ground. There are usually four or five eggs,\r\nwhite, spotted with brown. They have generally two broods a year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KINGBIRD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLICKER (_Colaptes auratus_)\r\n\r\nCALLED ALSO YELLOW-HAMMER, PIGEON WOODPECKER, HITTOCK, AND YUCKER\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, twelve and one-half inches; extent, about twelve inches. The\r\nback and wings above are of a dark umber, cross marked with streaks of\r\nblack; parts surrounding the eyes, a bright cinnamon color; upper part\r\nof head, dark gray; strip of black on each side of the throat about\r\none inch long; a narrow crescent-shaped spot of a vivid red upon the\r\nback of the head. The breast is ornamented with a broad crescent of\r\nblack; under parts of the body, white, tinged with yellow, and having\r\nmany round spots of black; the lower side of the wing and tail, a\r\nbeautiful golden yellow; the rump, white.\r\n\r\nThis bird may be easily distinguished by the white rump and the bright\r\nyellow under the wings seen in flight.\r\n\r\nIts food consists largely of wood lice, ants, of which it is very\r\nfond, and of other insects which it finds upon the ground or upon\r\ntrees. The female differs from the male in appearance, the black\r\nstrips upon the sides of the throat being very indistinct or wanting\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nThe flicker\'s nest, like those of other woodpeckers, may be found in\r\nmaples, oaks, apple trees, and occasionally pines or birches. They are\r\nmore frequently built in clusters of trees than in exposed places, and\r\nfrom ten to thirty feet from the ground. The male has been noticed\r\ncoming to the ground and throwing chips about, so that the\r\nnest-building might not be observed. The eggs are plain white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLICKER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED-HEADED WOODPECKER (_Melanerpes erythrocephalus_)\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, nine and one-half inches; extent, eighteen inches. The head\r\nand neck are crimson; a narrow crescent of black on the upper part of\r\nthe breast; back, outer part of the wings, and tail, black glossed\r\nwith blue; rump, lower part of the back, inner part of the wings, and\r\nthe whole under parts, from the breast downwards, white; legs and\r\nfeet, bluish green; claws, light blue. Like all woodpeckers, the tail\r\nfeathers are sharp and stiff and help the bird to sustain itself upon\r\nthe tree. It can strike hard blows with its bill, and drill into the\r\nhardest wood with rapidity and apparent ease. It will locate\r\naccurately the position of a grub or an insect that is within the wood\r\nof a tree, drill a hole to the inmate, and pull it out with its long,\r\nsticky tongue. The female is like the male in appearance, except that\r\nher colors are somewhat fainter. Woodpeckers as a class are\r\nbeneficial, and do much to preserve trees from destructive insects.\r\n\r\nThe red-headed woodpecker builds its nest at the bottom of a tunnel in\r\na tree, dug by other birds, or adapted to use from an already existing\r\ncavity. The nest is a mere heap of soft, decaying wood, more attention\r\nbeing paid by the bird to securing protection against rain than in\r\nhaving the nest clean and nice. The eggs are white, speckled with\r\nreddish brown, and are usually six in number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED-HEADED WOODPECKER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE JAY (_Cyanocitta cristata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, twelve inches; extent, seventeen inches. The head is crested;\r\ncrest and upper back are a light purplish blue; wings and tail, bright\r\nblue; a collar of black proceeds from the hind part of the head,\r\ngracefully curving down each side of the neck to the upper part of the\r\nbreast, where it forms a crescent; the chin, throat, and under parts\r\nare white or slightly tinged with blue; the tail is long and composed\r\nof twelve feathers marked with cross curves of black, each feather\r\nbeing tipped with white, except the two middle ones, which are a dark\r\npurple at the ends. The legs and bill are black.\r\n\r\nThe nest of the blue jay is large and clumsily made, and is placed\r\nhigh in the branches of tall trees, the cedar being preferred. It is\r\nlined with fine, fibrous roots. The eggs are four or five in number,\r\nof a dull olive, spotted with brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLUE JAY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOBOLINK (_Dolichonyx oryzivorus_)\r\n\r\nCALLED ALSO RICEBIRD, REEDBIRD, AND BOBLINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, seven and one-fourth inches; extent, twelve and one-fourth\r\ninches. The female is a little smaller than the male. The male has the\r\ntop and sides of the head and under parts black; large yellowish patch\r\non the back of the neck; middle of back is streaked with buff; lower\r\npart of the back and upper tail feathers, grayish white; wings and\r\ntail, black; the bill is short, conical, and is blue black. The tail\r\nfeathers are sharp-pointed and stiff like a woodpecker\'s. The female\r\nhas the upper parts olive buff streaked with black; yellowish beneath;\r\ntwo stripes on the top of head; wings and tail, brownish; tail\r\nfeathers with pointed tips. In the autumn the male puts on a dress\r\nsimilar to that of the female, the colors being a little more\r\npronounced.\r\n\r\nThe nest is built on the ground, of grasses. It contains from four to\r\nseven grayish eggs, spotted with blotches of brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOBOLINK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED-WINGED BLACKBIRD (_Agelaius phoeniceus_)\r\n\r\nCALLED ALSO AMERICAN REDWING, MARSH BLACKBIRD, AND SWAMP BLACKBIRD\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, nine and one-half inches; spread of wings, fifteen and\r\none-fourth inches. The male is of a uniform black, which glistens in\r\nthe sunshine; shoulders bright scarlet bordered with brownish yellow;\r\nbill, legs, and feet black. The female is smaller than the male, and\r\ndiffers greatly from him in appearance. She is dark brown above,\r\nstreaked with lighter and darker shades; below, gray streaked with\r\nbrown; throat and edge of wing tinged with pink or yellow, but mostly\r\npink in the summer. The young male at first resembles the female, but\r\nmay soon be recognized by black feathers appearing in patches.\r\n\r\nThe nests, which are composed chiefly of coarse grasses lined with\r\nfiner grass, are built upon the ground or in low bushes. Those built\r\nin bushes are compact, the others are generally loosely made. The eggs\r\nnumber four to six, spotted and lined with black and brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEADOW LARK (_Sturnella magna_)\r\n\r\nCALLED ALSO FIELD LARK\r\n\r\n\r\nLength of male, ten and one-half inches; spread of wings, sixteen\r\ninches. The female is smaller. The feathers above are dark brown, with\r\ntransverse dark brown bars across the wings and tail; the outer tail\r\nfeathers, white; the throat, breast, under parts and edge of wing,\r\nbright yellow. A yellow spot extends from the nostril to the eye. The\r\nbreast has a large black crescent, the points of which reach halfway\r\nup the neck; hind toes long, its claws twice as long as the middle\r\none. The female is like the male, but duller in color.\r\n\r\nTheir food is various forms of insects, beetles, grasshoppers,\r\ncutworms, larv\xc3\xa6, sometimes varied by the seeds of grasses and weeds,\r\nwild cherries, and berries.\r\n\r\nThe nest is built upon the ground, of dried grasses, carefully\r\nconcealed in tufts of grass. The eggs are oval, usually five in\r\nnumber; they are white, dotted with reddish brown. Both sexes engage\r\nin building the nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEADOW LARK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE ORIOLE (_Icterus galbula_)\r\n\r\nCALLED ALSO GOLDEN ROBIN, FIREBIRD, AND HANGBIRD\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, about eight inches; extent, twelve and one-half inches. The\r\nhead, throat, and upper part of the back are black; the lower part of\r\nthe back, the breast, and forward part of the wing are a brilliant\r\norange. The base of the middle tail feathers is orange, the ends\r\nblack; all the others are orange, with a black band in the middle. The\r\nfemale is smaller, and colors are not so bright.\r\n\r\nThe nest is composed of various materials, such as grasses, plant\r\nfibers, hairs, strings, which are capable of being interwoven. It is\r\nsuspended near the end of a limb. The eggs are commonly five in\r\nnumber. They are whitish and variously marked with black and brown\r\nspots and lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BALTIMORE ORIOLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG SPARROW (_Melospiza fasciata_)\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, a little over six inches; extent, about eight and one-half\r\ninches. General color of the upper parts brown streaked with black,\r\ngray, and different shades of brown; no white wing bars; the crown\r\ndull brown, with a faint grayish line in the middle; white line over\r\nthe eye; under parts whitish with numerous dark brown streaks on the\r\nneck, breast, and sides; a conspicuous black spot in the middle of the\r\nbreast; bill, legs, and feet are brownish. The female is the same as\r\nthe male.\r\n\r\nThe nest is composed of grasses, lined with finer grass. It is built\r\nin a low bush or on the ground. The eggs vary greatly both in size and\r\nin markings. They are generally five in number, and are greenish or\r\nbluish white, variously spotted with brown. These birds raise two and\r\nsometimes three broods.\r\n\r\nNot to know the song sparrow is to miss one of the delights of\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SONG SPARROW]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDFINCH (_Spinus tristis_)\r\n\r\nCALLED ALSO YELLOWBIRD, THISTLE-BIRD, AND WILD CANARY\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, five and one-fourth inches; extent, nearly nine inches. The\r\nback and under parts are bright yellow; wings and crown cap, black;\r\ntips of the wing and tail feathers, white on their inner webs. The\r\nmale in autumn loses his black cap, and his bright yellow parts change\r\nto a dull brownish yellow similar to the female; the wings and tail,\r\nhowever, remain darker and the white markings are more noticeable than\r\nthose of the female. The female has no black cap; the wings and tail\r\nare dusky, marked with white as in the male; lower parts, yellowish\r\ngray; upper parts inclining to olive.\r\n\r\nThe nest is cup-shaped, composed of plant fibers, lined with downy\r\nsubstances. The eggs are usually five in number, white or faintly\r\nbluish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLDFINCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK (_Habia Ludoviciana_)\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, eight inches; extent, thirteen inches. Back, throat, and head\r\nare black; breast and under wings, rose-red; wings, black; rump, white\r\ntipped with black. The female is about the same size as the male. Her\r\nupper parts are brown, margined with buff and pale brown, with whitish\r\nline over the eye; wings and tail, dark gray; feathers of the fore\r\nwing tipped with white; under parts yellowish, streaked with brown.\r\n\r\nThe nest is a thin, flat structure made of dried grasses and small\r\ntwigs. The eggs are greenish white with brown spots; they are usually\r\nfour in number. These birds are said to be great destroyers of potato\r\nbugs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCEDAR BIRD (_Ampelis cedrorum_)\r\n\r\nCALLED ALSO CHERRY BIRD, AMERICAN WAXWING, AND CANADIAN ROBIN\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, seven and one-fourth inches; extent, about twelve inches. The\r\nhead is crested; general color, grayish brown; forehead, chin, and a\r\nline through the eye, black; tail and wings, gray; tail tipped with\r\nyellow; some of the shorter wing feathers are tipped with small oblong\r\nbeads of red, resembling sealing wax.\r\n\r\nThese birds are fond of cherries and berries. The fruit grower can\r\nprotect his interests by planting some choke cherries, mulberries, and\r\nmountain ash trees at the edges of his orchard. Cedar birds destroy\r\ngreat quantities of insects, and are entitled to a part of the fruit\r\nwhich they have helped to save.\r\n\r\nThe nest is large and loosely made of strips of bark, leaves, grasses,\r\nsometimes of mud, lined with finer materials. The eggs are usually\r\nfive in number, dull gray spotted with black and brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CEDAR BIRD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN THRUSH (_Harporhynchus rufus_)\r\n\r\nCALLED ALSO BROWN THRASHER\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, eleven and one-fourth inches; extent, thirteen inches; tail,\r\nfive and one-half inches long. The iris is yellow; upper parts,\r\nreddish or cinnamon brown; lower parts, white; feathers of middle wing\r\nedged with white; the breast and sides strongly spotted with dark\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nThe nest is a carelessly made, bulky affair, composed of rootlets,\r\nstrips of bark, twigs, leaves, and other material. It is generally\r\npoorly concealed in some low tree or even in the corner of a fence.\r\nFor this reason it is frequently broken up. The eggs, four or five in\r\nnumber, are brownish mottled with darker brown. During the nesting\r\nseason the bird at morning and in the afternoon ascends to the tops of\r\ntrees and pours forth his wonderful song. He has even been thought to\r\nbe "showing off," for he will sing almost as long as any one will stay\r\nto listen; but he is probably attracting attention to himself in order\r\nto detract it from his nest, which is always somewhere within the\r\ncircle of his song.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROWN THRUSH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICKADEE (_Parus atricapillus_)\r\n\r\nCALLED ALSO BLACKCAP TITMOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, five and one-half inches; extent, eight inches. The general\r\ncolor of back is ashy; the top of head, throat, and chin black; no\r\ncrest; under parts, whitish with buff on the sides; wing and tail\r\nfeathers edged with white; legs, bluish gray; bill, black. The song of\r\nthis bird is an oft-repeated _chick-a-dee_, from which it takes its\r\nname. Its call consists of two high notes, the first one a third above\r\nthe second, which may be easily imitated, and the bird attracted to\r\nthe vicinity of the person answering his call.\r\n\r\nIts nest is made of grasses and feathers, placed in a hole in a stump\r\nor tree; frequently in the deserted cavity made by a woodpecker. The\r\neggs, six or seven, are white, spotted with brown about the larger\r\nend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHICKADEE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATBIRD (_Galeoscoptes Carolinensis_)\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, nine inches; extent, eleven and one-half inches. The general\r\ncolor is dark slate, somewhat lighter beneath; top of the head and\r\ntail, black; under side of tail near the base, chestnut; bill and\r\nfeet, black; eye, brown. The female is like the male, but smaller. As\r\na musician, this bird closely approaches the brown thrush. There are\r\ngreat differences in individual singers.\r\n\r\nThe nest is bulky, composed of twigs, rootlets, dead leaves, strips of\r\nbark, etc. Strips of grapevine bark are quite commonly used, some\r\nnests being constructed almost wholly of this material. The eggs are\r\ngenerally four in number and of a greenish blue, unmarked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATBIRD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUEBIRD (_Sialia sialis_)\r\n\r\n\r\nLength, six and one-half inches; extent, twelve and one-half inches.\r\nThe upper parts, wings, and tail are bright blue; sides of the head\r\nand upper part of chin also blue; throat, breast, and sides, reddish\r\nbrown; abdomen and under side of tail, white; legs and bill, blackish;\r\neye, brown. The female is similarly marked, but the colors are duller.\r\n\r\nThe bluebird\'s song is a continued pleasing, rich warble.\r\n\r\nThe nest is loosely built of grasses, feathers, and soft material, in\r\nholes of trees, in hollows of posts, or in bird boxes. The eggs are\r\nlight blue and are four or five in number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLUEBIRD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bird Day; How to prepare for it, by \r\nCharles Almanzo Babcock\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BIRD DAY; HOW TO PREPARE FOR IT ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 21266-8.txt or 21266-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/2/6/21266/\r\n\r\nProduced by Bryan Ness, Sankar Viswanathan, and the Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This\r\nfile was produced from images generously made available\r\nby the Library of Congress)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
