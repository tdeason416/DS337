ELSON AND CHRISTINE M. KECK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is based on the belief that an efficient reader for the\r\nfifth grade must score high when tested on five fundamental features:\r\nquality of literature; variety of literature; organization of\r\nliterature; quantity of literature; and definite helps sufficient to\r\nmake the text a genuine tool for classroom use.\r\n\r\nQuality Literature:\r\n\r\nFirst among these features is the essential that the foundation of the\r\nbook must be the acknowledged masterpieces of American and British\r\nauthors. American boys and girls may be depended upon to read current\r\nmagazines and newspapers, but if they are ever to have their taste and\r\njudgment of literary values enriched by familiarity with the classics\r\nof our literature, the schools must provide the opportunity. This\r\nideal does not mean the exclusion of well established present-day\r\nwriters, but it does mean that the core of the school reader should be\r\nthe rich literary heritage that has won recognition for its enduring\r\nvalue. Moreover, these masterpieces must come to the pupil in complete\r\nunits, not in mere excerpts or garbled "cross-sections"; for the pupil\r\nin his school life should gain some real literary possessions.\r\n\r\nA study of the contents of The Elson Readers, Book Five, will show how\r\nconsistently its authors have based the book on this sound test of\r\nquality. The works of the acknowledged "makers" of our literature have\r\nbeen abundantly drawn upon to furnish a foundation of great stories\r\nand poems, gripping in interest and well within the powers of\r\nchild-appreciation in this grade.\r\n\r\nVariety of Literature:\r\n\r\nVariety is fundamental to a well-rounded course of reading. If the\r\nschool reader is to provide for all the purposes that a collection\r\nof literature for this grade should serve, it must contain material\r\ncovering at least the following types: (1) literature representing\r\nboth British and American authors; (2) some of the best modern poetry\r\nand prose as well as the literature of the past; (3) important race\r\nstories--great epics--and world-stories of adventure; (4) patriotic\r\nliterature, rich in ideals of home and country, loyalty and service,\r\nthrift, cooperation, and citizenship--ideals of which American\r\nchildren gained, during the World War, a new conception that the\r\nschool reader should perpetuate; (5) literature suited to festival\r\noccasions, particularly those celebrated in the schools: Armistice\r\nDay, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas, Arbor Day and Bird Day,\r\nanniversaries of the birthdays of Lincoln and Washington, as well as\r\nof Longfellow and other great American authors; (6) literature of the\r\nseasons, Nature, and out-of-door life; (7) literature of humor that\r\nwill enliven the reading and cultivate the power to discriminate\r\nbetween wholesome humor--an essential part of life--and crude humor,\r\nso prevalent in the pupil\'s outside reading; (8) adventure stories\r\nboth imaginative and real; (9) literature suited to dramatization,\r\nproviding real project material.\r\n\r\nThis book offers a well-rounded course of reading covering all the\r\ntypes mentioned above. Especially by means of groups of stories and\r\npoems that portray love of home and its festivals, love of our free\r\ncountry and its flag, and unselfish service to others, this book makes\r\na stirring appeal to good citizenship. Moreover, it will be noted that\r\nwholesome ethical ideals pervade the literature throughout.\r\n\r\nOrganization of Literature:\r\n\r\nThe literature of a school reader, if it is to do effective work, must\r\nbe purposefully organized. Sound organization groups into related\r\nunits the various selections that center about a common theme. This\r\narrangement enables the pupil to see the larger dominant ideas of the\r\nbook as a whole, instead of looking upon it as a confused scrapbook\r\nof miscellaneous selections. Such arrangement also fosters literary\r\ncomparison by bringing together selections having a common theme or\r\nauthorship.\r\n\r\nThis book has been so organized as to fulfill these purposes. There\r\nare three main Parts, each distinguished by unity of theme or\r\nauthorship. Part I, leading from a wholesome appreciation of Nature,\r\nparticularly in its American setting, centers mainly about the\r\nimportant themes of patriotism, service, and good citizenship; Part II\r\nintroduces some of the great tales that typify our love of stirring\r\ndeeds; Part III presents some of our greatest American authors at\r\nsufficient length to make them stand out to the pupil. Through these\r\ngrouped selections, together with the accompanying biographies, pupils\r\nmay come to be familiar with and love some of the great company of\r\nwriters that have made the name of America known in the world of\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nAttention is called to three special features that keep the dominant\r\ntheme of each Part clearly in the foreground: (1) "A Forward Look" and\r\n"A Backward Look" for each main division and important subdivisions\r\nemphasize the larger theme, and show how each selection contributes to\r\nthe group-idea (see pages 19, 56, etc.); (2) the Notes and Questions\r\nfrequently call the pupil\'s attention to the relation the selection\r\nbears to the main thought (see pages 39, 75, etc.); (3) the three main\r\ndivisions, and the subordinate groups within each main unit, are made\r\nto stand out clearly by illustrations that typify the theme (see\r\npages 18, 21, etc.) and by topical headings that enable the pupil to\r\nvisualize the group-units. By these three means the organization of\r\nthe book is emphasized, and fundamental ideals are kept dominant.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuality of Literature:\r\n\r\nObviously, a book that is to supply the pupil with a year\'s course in\r\nliterature must be a generous volume. Variety is impossible without\r\nquantity, especially where literary wholes rather than mere\r\nfragmentary excerpts are offered. Particularly is this true when\r\ncomplete units are included not only for intensive study, but also for\r\nextensive reading--longer units, of the so-called "paper classics"\r\ntype, to be read mainly for the story-element. In bulk such units\r\nshould be as large as the pupil can control readily in rapid silent\r\nreading, a kind of reading that increases the power to enjoy with\r\nintelligence a magazine or a book.\r\n\r\nThe Elson Readers, Book Five, is a generous volume in provision for\r\nthese needs. Its inclusiveness makes possible a proper balance between\r\nprose and poetry, between long and short selections, and between\r\nmaterial for intensive and extensive reading.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinite Helps:\r\n\r\nIf the pupil is to gain the full benefit from his reading, certain\r\ndefinite helps must be provided. An efficient reader must score a high\r\ntest not only on the fundamentals of quality, variety, organization\r\nand quantity of literature, but also on its fitness as a tool for\r\nclassroom use. The effectiveness of this Reader as such a tool may be\r\nindicated by the following distinguishing features:\r\n\r\n(1) A distinctive introduction, "The Crystal Glass" (see page 13),\r\ngives the pupil an illuminating interpretation of the organization and\r\nliterary content of the volume.\r\n\r\n(2) Definite suggestions for developing speed and concentration in\r\nsilent reading. (See pages 21, 30, 34, 163, etc.)\r\n\r\n(3) A comprehensive Glossary (pages 399-418) contains the words\r\nand phrases that offer valuable vocabulary training, either of\r\npronunciation or meaning. The teacher is free to use the Glossary\r\naccording to the needs of her particular class, but suggestive type\r\nwords and phrases are listed under Notes and Questions.\r\n\r\n(4) A complete program of study, "How to Gain the Full Benefit from\r\nYour Reading" (pages 28, 29), gives a concise explanation of the\r\nvarious helps found in the book.\r\n\r\n(5) The helps to study are more than mere notes; they aid in making\r\nsignificant the larger purposes of the literature. These "Notes and\r\nQuestions" include:\r\n\r\n  (a) Biographies of the authors, that supply data for interpreting the\r\n  stories and poems; particularly helpful are those of Part III;\r\n\r\n  (b) Historical settings, wherever they are necessary to the\r\n  intelligent understanding of the selection (see pages 94, 105, etc.);\r\n\r\n  (c) Questions and suggestions that present clearly the main idea,\r\n  stimulate original discussion and comparison, and bring out modern\r\n  parallels to the situations found in the selections;\r\n\r\n  (d) Words of everyday use frequently mispronounced, listed, for study\r\n  under "Discussion" (see page 29, etc.);\r\n\r\n  (e) Phrases that offer idiomatic difficulty; for convenience in\r\n  locating these phrases the page and line numbers are indicated;\r\n\r\n  (f) Projects, individual and social.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR AN ORDER OF READING\r\nTHE CRYSTAL GLASS\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nNATURE--HUMOR--HOME AND COUNTRY\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD OF NATURE\r\n\r\nA Forward Look\r\n\r\nANIMALS\r\n\r\nTurk, The Faithful Dog          Samuel White Baker\r\nOur Uninvited Guest             Ernest Harold Baynes\r\nHunting The American Buffalo    Theodore Roosevelt\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS AND THEIR SONGS\r\n\r\nThe Birds And I         Liberty H.

Such an arrangement enables the pupil to see the dominant\r\nideas of the book as a whole. This purpose is further aided by A\r\nForward Look, or introduction, and A Backward Look, or review, for\r\neach main group. The book, therefore, emphasizes certain fundamental\r\nideals, making them stand out clearly in the mind of the pupil. This\r\nresult can best be accomplished by reading all the selections of a\r\ngroup in the order given, before taking up those of a different\r\ngroup. The order of the groups, however, may be varied to suit school\r\nconditions or preferences.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that selections particularly suited to the\r\ncelebration of special days will be read in connection with such\r\nfestival occasions. For example, "The First Thanksgiving Day," page\r\n92, will be read immediately before the Thanksgiving holiday, even if\r\nthe class at that particular time is in the midst of some other\r\nmain part of the Reader. Before assigning a selection out of order,\r\nhowever, the teacher should scrutinize the notes and questions, to\r\nmake certain that no references are made within these notes to a\r\ndiscussion in A Forward Look or to other selections in the group\r\nthat pupils have not yet read. In case such references are found\r\nthe teacher may well conduct a brief class discussion to make these\r\nquestions significant to the pupils.\r\n\r\nIt is the belief of the authors that the longer selections, such as\r\nthose found in Part II, should be read silently and reported on in\r\nclass. In this way the monotony incident to the reading of such\r\nselections aloud in class will be avoided. However, the class will\r\nwish to read aloud certain passages from these longer units because of\r\ntheir beauty, their dramatic quality, or the forceful way in which\r\nthe author has expressed his thoughts. Class readings are frequently\r\nsuggested for this purpose. In this way reading aloud is given\r\npurposefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRYSTAL GLASS\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, as the fairy tale has it, there was a mighty\r\nmagician named Merlin. He was the teacher of the young Prince Arthur,\r\nwho was one day to become the British King. Merlin was old and\r\nwise, and he had the power of prophecy. One of his most wonderful\r\npossessions was a magic glass, a globe of crystal, into which one\r\nmight gaze and see distant places as if they were near at hand, and\r\nsee the events of past and future as if they were happening right\r\nbefore his eyes.\r\n\r\nNo one knows now the whereabouts of this wonder-working crystal, or\r\nwhat was its appearance. Very likely it seemed ordinary enough, though\r\na glass of curious shape. Only those who knew how to use it could\r\nlearn its secrets; for all others it had no power. But the magic that\r\nonce lay in it has been given to certain books, which, like Merlin\'s\r\nglobe, are filled with mysterious power. Such a book you now hold in\r\nyour hands. If you do not understand how to use it, it will tell you\r\nnothing. But if you have this understanding, you have only to look\r\nwithin these pages, and past and present and future will be unfolded\r\nto your gaze.\r\n\r\nHere is what you will find if you use this book as a Merlin\'s glass\r\nwherein to see the wonders which lie concealed within it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you will see the world of animals and birds and flowers\r\nand times and seasons--the world of Nature. There is a story about a\r\nlittle girl who wanted to see the King to ask of him a favor. But no\r\none could see him unless he was accompanied by some friends, for the\r\nKing would not trust anyone unless he had proved himself friendly so\r\nthat people loved to be with him. Now this little girl was very poor,\r\nand she had no friends. She wandered alone in the forest, and cried\r\nbecause she had no friends. Just at this time she came into the\r\nknowledge of a wonderful secret by which she could understand the\r\nlanguage of the birds and of all the shy animals of the forest, and as\r\nsoon as she could understand them and talk with them, they loved\r\nher, and the forest was no longer a lonely place but was filled with\r\nfriends. Some of these friends went with her to the King\'s palace, and\r\nshe now had no difficulty. She knew the language of those who lived in\r\nthe forest, and she was no longer poor and lonely. So in the pages\r\nof this book you will learn of the lives of faithful dogs and huge\r\nbuffaloes, and the brown thrush will sing for you a song full of\r\nmeaning. The modest violet, the jack-in-the-pulpit, even the four-leaf\r\nclovers will tell you stories about the forest and the field, so that\r\nwherever you walk you will be surrounded by your friends. The magic\r\nglass of Merlin will unseal for you this world of Nature.\r\n\r\nMerlin\'s globe also enables you to look into the past and live in\r\nit as if it were the present. You will take part in the first\r\nThanksgiving Day. You will learn why the flag of our country is called\r\nOld Glory. You will look in upon the boy Lincoln, tired after his\r\nhard day\'s work on the farm, reading by the open fire in his father\'s\r\ncabin. You will see the young Washington bravely helping General\r\nBraddock to save his soldiers. So the magic glass of reading will make\r\nthe early history of our country real to you, and the past will no\r\nlonger be the past but a part of your present life.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to live for a time in the fairy realm, where there are\r\nburied treasure chests or magic lamps and rings, or if you would like\r\nto make a journey to far-off lands where are many wonders, you have\r\nonly to look in this magic glass, and in a twinkling you are whisked\r\naway. You find yourself in a strange country where men and women wear\r\ncurious, flowing garments of many colors, where trees and animals are\r\nunfamiliar, and where queer buildings with many towers attract your\r\ndelighted eyes. The narrow streets are filled with strange life. You\r\nsee a boy with eyes that seem to be looking on strange things. He is\r\ntalking with an evil-looking man who bends over him, pointing down the\r\nstreet and out into the open country at the other end of the town. And\r\npresently the boy goes with the stranger, and you follow, for it is\r\nAladdin and the magician, and you wish to know the adventure that is\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Ali Baba and the cave of buried treasure and the forty\r\nthieves and Morgiana, the shrewd slave-girl, and the jars of oil\r\nwill all appear in the magic glass, and another series of marvelous\r\nadventures will be disclosed to you. And then again, you come to a\r\nrich man\'s home, and before it, gazing enviously at it, is a poor\r\ntramp. Go up the steps with him and look upon the feast within the\r\nhouse. There is a queer table filled with food of strange form. And\r\nthere is the rich man, Sindbad the Sailor, and you may listen if you\r\nwill to his stories of travel to marvelous lands. Thus you travel\r\nto the mysterious East, without effort. You take part in wonderful\r\nadventures, without danger. Your magic glass is the window through\r\nwhich a world of fairy magic gleams vividly.\r\n\r\nAt another time you look, and the glass shows an English scene. It is\r\nthe greenwood, somewhat out from London. Never were trees so green, or\r\nflowers so fresh and gay, or birds so filled with joy. You listen, and\r\na gay fellow sings,\r\n\r\n    "Under the greenwood tree\r\n    Who loves to lie with me,\r\n    And tune his merry note\r\n    Unto the sweet bird\'s throat,\r\n\r\n    "Come hither! come hither! come hither!\r\n    Here shall he see\r\n    No enemy\r\n    But winter and rough weather."\r\n\r\nPresently you hear the sound of a horn deep in the forest, to be\r\nfollowed soon by the coming of a merry crowd. Here is the prince\r\nof outlaws, clad in Lincoln green and followed by a score of lusty\r\nfellows, and at once there are songs, wrestling matches, and merry\r\njests, till your heart is filled with joy. Little John, and the\r\nSheriff of Nottingham, and Friar Tuck, and Robin Hood, and last of\r\nall, the King himself--these are the actors in the play that you see\r\nthrough your magic glass. And so it goes through all these stories of\r\nadventure--they become a part of your experience, and you live more\r\nlives than one. Last of all, your magic glass, which is this book, and\r\nwhich is always ready to do you service when you call upon it, will\r\nintroduce you to a group of great Americans who long ago learned these\r\nsecrets and wrote down what they themselves had seen. A patriot who\r\nhelped to make our America will tell you several stories of his\r\nchildhood. A Nature-loving poet will tell you about flowers and birds.\r\nAnother poet will furnish stories about merry times on the farm. A\r\nthird will tell you legends of the Indians. Once more the world of\r\nNature, the world of adventure, and the world of history and legend\r\nwill open before you, but this time you will learn something also of\r\nthe men who have lived in our America and have written about it in\r\nsuch way as to show us that, after all, we need no marvelous Eastern\r\ncountry or desert islands--there is adventure enough and to spare all\r\nabout us, if we have eyes to see.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the greatest charm of all. It is good to know about this\r\nmagic glass of reading, so that we shall never want for the joy it\r\ncan bring. But while we use it, we shall find our sight made pure and\r\nstrong, so that when we no longer have the crystal globe, we can walk\r\nin field and wood, and along our streets, and see, wondering, the\r\nbeauty of the world in which we live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nNATURE--HUMOR--HOME AND COUNTRY\r\n\r\nBetter--a thousand times better--than all the material wealth the\r\nworld can give is the love for the best books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD OF NATURE\r\n\r\nA FORWARD LOOK\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we have eyes to see, the world of Nature is a fairyland. Further\r\non in this book you will read how Aladdin--a boy who was led by a\r\nmagician to a cave in which were all kinds of wonderful objects--came\r\nupon a garden underground wherein grew trees filled with extraordinary\r\nfruit. "Each tree bore fruit of a different color," we are told: "The\r\nwhite were pearls; the sparkling were diamonds; the deep red were\r\nrubies; the green, emeralds; the blue, turquoises."\r\n\r\nNow with this compare a story about a great American author, Ralph\r\nWaldo Emerson. Emerson loved all the forms of Nature. He wrote of\r\nthe bee, of the wild flowers, of the storm, of the snowbird, and of\r\nrunning waters. And in talking of the magic of a river he reminds us\r\nof Aladdin\'s fairy fruits:\r\n\r\n    "I see thy brimming, eddying stream\r\n    And thy enchantment,\r\n    For thou changest every rock in thy bed\r\n    Into a gem.\r\n    All is opal and agate,\r\n    And at will thou pavest with diamonds."\r\n\r\nNow we may suppose that Aladdin often waded through the brook and\r\nnoticed the shining pebbles and heard the tinkling music of the water\r\nas it rippled over stones in the stream. He noticed the pebbles, but\r\ndid not look at them. He heard the murmur of the waters, but he did\r\nnot listen. But when the magician uttered his magic words, and the\r\nearth opened, and Aladdin saw a little ladder leading down into a deep\r\ncave, and in that cave found curious trees bearing curious fruits, he\r\nwas so surprised that he looked more closely, and all that he saw was\r\nfull of wonder. Now the poet is like the magician. His words open the\r\ndoor of enchantment for us if we care to enter.\r\n\r\nFor the poets have been lovers of Nature, and they help us to see\r\nthe beauty that lies about us. One of them calls the stars "the\r\nforget-me-nots of the angels." Another writes of the song of the brook\r\nas it goes dancing and singing down into the river, until we hear the\r\nmusic of the waters in the melody of the poet\'s verse. Through such\r\nstories and poems of animals and birds and flowers and of the seasons\r\nof the year as you will find in the following pages, your magic glass\r\nof reading will open up the fairyland of Nature.\r\n\r\nFor magic wonders are not limited to the fairylands that we read about\r\nin the Arabian Nights or in the tales of Cinderella or of the Sleeping\r\nBeauty. There is the enchantment which put the princess and all her\r\nhousehold to sleep for a hundred years until the prince came to\r\nrelease them. There is also the enchantment of the frost, that stills\r\nall the life of brook and lake and river, and holds the outdoor world\r\nin deep sleep until the breath of spring comes and releases the\r\nprisoners. There is the enchantment which Aladdin controlled by his\r\nlamp and his ring, so that at his bidding giant figures appeared to do\r\nhis will; there is also the enchantment of the snow, of the fire,\r\nof the lightning, of the storm; or there is the equally marvelous\r\nenchantment by which the rose unfolds from the bud, the apple grows\r\nfrom the blossom, and the robin from the tiny blue egg. Only we must\r\nsee and listen when the magicians lead us to the fairy world of\r\nNature. Aladdin had passed the entrance to the magic cave a hundred\r\ntimes and had seen nothing. So men pass the fields and see nothing but\r\nthe corn and the wheat and the cotton, and in the autumn they see the\r\nharvesters gathering the crops of the fields. But the poet looks on\r\nthese same fields and gathers another crop from them, and this he puts\r\ninto a song, and this song opens for us the world of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nTURK, THE FAITHFUL\r\n\r\nSamuel White Baker\r\n\r\n\r\nTURK\'S FAILURE\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy, my grandfather frequently told a story concerning a\r\ndog which he knew, as an example of true fidelity. This animal was\r\na mastiff that belonged to a friend, Mr. Prideaux, to whom it was a\r\nconstant companion. Whenever Mr. Prideaux went out for a walk, Turk\r\nwas sure to be near his heels. Street dogs would bark and snarl at the\r\ngiant as his massive form attracted their attention, but Turk seldom\r\nnoticed them. At night he slept outside his master\'s door, and no\r\nsentry could be more alert upon his watch than the faithful dog.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. Prideaux had a dinner party. The dog Turk was present, and\r\nstretched his huge form upon the hearthrug. It was a cold night in\r\nwinter, and Mr. Prideaux\'s friends after dinner began to discuss the\r\nsubject of dogs. Almost every person had an anecdote to relate, and\r\nmy own grandfather, being present, had no doubt added his mite to the\r\ncollection, when Turk suddenly awoke from a sound sleep, and having\r\nstretched himself, walked up to his master\'s side and rested his large\r\nhead upon the table. "Ha, ha, Turk!" exclaimed Mr. Prideaux, "you\r\nmust have heard our arguments about the dogs, so you have put in an\r\nappearance."\r\n\r\n"And a magnificent animal he is!" remarked my grandfather; "but\r\nalthough a mastiff is the largest of dogs, I do not think it is as\r\nsensible as many others."\r\n\r\n"As a rule you are right," replied his master, "because they are\r\ngenerally chained up as watch-dogs, and have not the intimate\r\nassociation with human beings which is so great an advantage to\r\nhouse-dogs; but Turk has been my constant companion from the first\r\nmonth of his life, and his intelligence is very remarkable. He\r\nunderstands most things that I say, if they are connected with\r\nhimself; he will often lie upon the rug with his large eyes fixed upon\r\nme, and he will frequently become aware that I wish to go out; at such\r\ntimes he will fetch my hat, cane, or gloves, whichever may be at hand,\r\nand wait for me at the front door. He will take a letter to several\r\nhouses of my acquaintance, and wait for a reply; and he can perform a\r\nvariety of actions that would imply a share of reason seldom possessed\r\nby other dogs."\r\n\r\nA smile upon several faces was at once noticed by Mr. Prideaux, who\r\nimmediately took a guinea from his pocket, and said to his dog, "Here,\r\nTurk! They won\'t believe in you! Take this guinea to No.--Street, to\r\nMr.--, and bring me a receipt."\r\n\r\nThe dog wagged his huge tail with pleasure, and the guinea having been\r\nplaced in his mouth, he hastened toward the door; this being opened,\r\nhe was admitted through the front entrance to the street. It was a\r\nmiserable night.\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing the sleet and rain against the windows, and the\r\ngutters were running with muddy water; nevertheless, Turk had started\r\nupon his mission in the howling gale, while the front door was once\r\nmore closed against the blast.\r\n\r\nThe party were comfortably seated around the fire, much interested in\r\nthe success or failure of the dog\'s adventure.\r\n\r\n"How long will it be before we may expect Turk\'s return?" inquired a\r\nguest.\r\n\r\n"The house to which I have sent him is about a mile and a half\r\ndistant; therefore, if there is no delay when he barks for admission\r\nat the door, and my friend is not absent from home, he should return\r\nin about three-quarters of an hour with a receipt. If, on the other\r\nhand, he cannot gain admission, he may wait for any length of time,"\r\nreplied his master.\r\n\r\nSome among the company supported the dog\'s chances of success, while\r\nothers were against him. The evening wore away; the allotted time\r\nwas exceeded, and a whole hour had passed, but no dog had returned.\r\nNevertheless, his master was still hopeful.\r\n\r\n"I must tell you," said Mr. Prideaux, "that Turk frequently carries\r\nnotes for me, and as he knows the house well, he certainly will not\r\nmake a mistake; perhaps my friend may be dining out, in which case,\r\nTurk will probably wait for a longer time."\r\n\r\nTwo hours passed; the storm was raging. Mr. Prideaux himself went to\r\nthe front door, which flew open before a fierce gust the instant\r\nthat the lock was turned. The gutters were clogged with masses of\r\nhalf-melted snow. "Poor Turk!" muttered his master, "this is indeed\r\na wretched night for you. Perhaps they have kept you in the warm\r\nkitchen, and will not allow you to return in such fearful weather."\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Prideaux returned to his guests, he could not conceal his\r\ndisappointment. "Ha!" exclaimed one, "with a guinea in his mouth, he\r\nhas probably gone into some house of entertainment where dogs are\r\nsupplied with dinner and a warm bed, instead of shivering in a\r\nwinter\'s gale!" Jokes were made at the absent dog\'s expense, but his\r\nmaster was anxious and annoyed. Poor Turk\'s reputation had suffered\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\nIt was long past midnight; the guests had departed, the storm was\r\nraging, and violent gusts occasionally shook the house. Mr. Prideaux\r\nwas alone in his study, and he poked the fire until it blazed and\r\nroared up the chimney. "What can have become of that dog?" exclaimed\r\nhis master to himself, now really anxious; "I hope they kept him; most\r\nlikely they would not send him back upon such a dreadful night."\r\n\r\nMr. Prideaux\'s study was close to the front door, and his attention\r\nwas suddenly directed to a violent shaking and scratching. In an\r\ninstant he ran into the hall and unlocked the entrance door. A mass of\r\nfilth and mud entered. This was Turk!\r\n\r\nThe dog was shivering with wet and cold. His usually clean coat was\r\nthick with mire, as though he had been dragged through deep mud.\r\nHe wagged his tail when he heard his master\'s voice, but appeared\r\ndejected and ill. The dog was taken downstairs, and immediately placed\r\nin a large tub of hot water, in which he was accustomed to be bathed.\r\nIt was now discovered that in addition to mud and dirt, which almost\r\nconcealed his coat, he was besmeared with blood! Mr. Prideaux sponged\r\nhis favorite with warm water, and, to his surprise, he saw wounds of a\r\nserious nature; the dog\'s throat was badly torn, his back and breast\r\nwere deeply bitten, and there could be no doubt that he had been\r\nworried by a pack of dogs.\r\n\r\nHe was now washed clean, and was being rubbed dry with a thick towel\r\nwhile he stood upon a blanket before the fire. "Why, Turk, old boy,\r\nwhat has been the matter? Tell us all about it, poor old man!"\r\nexclaimed his master.\r\n\r\nThe dog was now thoroughly warmed and he panted with the heat of\r\nthe kitchen fire; he opened his mouth, and the guinea which he had\r\nreceived in trust dropped on the kitchen floor!\r\n\r\n"There is some mystery in this," said Mr. Prideaux, "which I will try\r\nto discover tomorrow. He has been set upon by strange dogs, and rather\r\nthan lose the guinea, he has allowed himself to be half killed without\r\nonce opening his mouth in self-defense! Poor Turk!" continued his\r\nmaster, "you must have lost your way old man, in the darkness and\r\nstorm; most likely confused after the unequal fight. What an example\r\nyou have given us in being faithful to a trust!"\r\n\r\nTurk was wonderfully better after his warm bath. He lapped up a large\r\nbowl of good thick soup mixed with bread, and in half an hour was\r\ncomfortably asleep upon his thick rug by his master\'s bedroom door.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY EXPLAINED\r\n\r\nUpon the following morning the storm had cleared away, and a bright\r\nsky had succeeded to the gloom of the preceding night. Immediately\r\nafter breakfast Mr. Prideaux, accompanied by his dog (which was,\r\nalthough rather stiff, not much the worse for the rough treatment he\r\nhad received), started for a walk toward the house to which he had\r\ndirected Turk upon the previous evening. He was anxious to discover\r\nwhether his friend had been absent, as he believed that the dog might\r\nhave been waiting for admittance, and had been perhaps attacked by\r\nsome dogs in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe master and Turk had walked for nearly a mile, and had just turned\r\nthe corner of a street, when, as they passed a butcher\'s shop, a large\r\nbrindled mastiff rushed from the shop-door and flew at Turk.\r\n\r\n"Call your dog off!" shouted Mr. Prideaux to the butcher, who watched\r\nthe attack with impudent satisfaction. "Call him off, or my dog will\r\nkill him!" continued Mr. Prideaux.\r\n\r\nThe usually docile Turk had rushed to meet his assailant with a fury\r\nthat was extraordinary. With a growl like that of a lion he quickly\r\nseized his foe by the throat, and in a fierce struggle of only a few\r\nseconds he threw the brindled dog upon his back. It was in vain that\r\nMr. Prideaux tried to call him off; he never for an instant relaxed\r\nhis hold, but with the strength of a wild beast of prey Turk shook the\r\nhead of the butcher\'s dog to the right and left. The butcher attempted\r\nto interfere and lashed him with a huge whip. "Stand clear! fair play!\r\nDon\'t you strike my dog!" shouted Mr. Prideaux. "Your dog was the\r\nfirst to attack!" Mr. Prideaux seized Turk by his collar, while the\r\nbutcher was endeavoring to release his dog from the deadly grip. At\r\nlength Mr. Prideaux\'s voice and action appeared for a moment to create\r\na calm, and he held back his dog. Turk\'s flanks were heaving with\r\nthe intense exertion and excitement of the fight, and he strained\r\nto escape from his master\'s hold to attack once more his enemy. At\r\nlength, by kind words and the caress of the well-known hand, his fury\r\nwas calmed down.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s the most curious adventure I\'ve ever had with a dog!"\r\nexclaimed the butcher who was now completely crestfallen. "Why, that\'s\r\nthe very dog! That\'s the very dog that came by my shop late last night\r\nin the howling storm, and my dog Tiger went at him and tousled him\r\nup completely. I never saw such a cowardly cur; he wouldn\'t show any\r\nfight, although he was pretty near as big as a donkey; and there my\r\ndog Tiger nearly ate half of him, and dragged the other half about\r\nthe gutter, till he looked more like an old door-mat than dog; and I\r\nthought he must have killed him; and here he comes out as fresh as\r\npaint today."\r\n\r\n"What do you say?" asked Mr. Prideaux. "Was it your dog that worried\r\nmy poor dog last night when he was upon a message of trust? My friend,\r\nlet me inform you of the fact that my dog had a guinea in his mouth to\r\ncarry to my friend, and rather than drop it, he allowed himself to be\r\nhalf killed by your savage Tiger. Today he has proved his courage,\r\nand your dog has discovered his mistake. This is the guinea that he\r\ndropped from his mouth when he returned to me after midnight, beaten\r\nand distressed!" said Mr. Prideaux, much excited. "Here, Turk, old\r\nboy, take the guinea again, and come along with me! You have had your\r\nrevenge, and have given us all a lesson." His master gave him the\r\nguinea in his mouth, and they continued their walk.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, upon Mr. Prideaux\'s arrival at his friend\'s house, that\r\nTurk had never been there; probably after his defeat he had become so\r\nconfused that he lost his way in the heavy storm, and had at length\r\nregained the road home some time after midnight, in the condition\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Gain the Full Benefit from Your Reading\r\n\r\nThe reading of this story, besides giving you pleasure, has no doubt\r\ngiven you a new idea of the faithfulness often shown by dogs. But if\r\nyou are to get the full benefit from any story or poem in this Reader,\r\nyou will need to pause long enough to notice certain things that will\r\ngive you a better understanding of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crystal Glass, A Forward Look, and A Backward Look.\r\n\r\nFirst, you should read and discuss in class "The Crystal Glass" and\r\nstudy the Table of Contents, to gain a general idea of the book as a\r\nwhole. Next, you should notice that each story and poem is a part of\r\nsome special group that treats of some one big idea--such as Nature,\r\nHome and Country, etc. Each selection will have a fuller meaning for\r\nyou if you understand how it helps to bring out the big idea of this\r\ngroup. Before reading the stories in any group you should read and\r\ndiscuss in class the "Forward Look" (see page 19) that precedes them.\r\nAnd after you have read all the selections in a group, you will enjoy\r\na pleasant class period discussing the "Backward Look"--taking stock,\r\nas it were, of the joy and benefit gained from your reading.\r\n\r\nIn addition, each selection is followed by Notes and Questions that\r\ncontain some or all of the following features: Biography. First, it is\r\nalways desirable to learn something about the author. When you read,\r\nfor example, that Samuel White Baker gave the best years of his\r\nlife to a study of animals, you feel that his story of the dog\'s\r\nfaithfulness is well worth reading. Discussion. Next, if you will read\r\nthe story so carefully that you can answer the questions given under\r\nthe topic Discussion, you will probably find it easier to understand\r\ncertain incidents. For example, you hear much about the word "service"\r\nin the different wars in which American soldiers have served their\r\ncountry so nobly. But perhaps when you think of the answer to the\r\nthird question you will see more clearly than before that "service"\r\nand "faithfulness" are qualities that are shown not only on the\r\nbattlefield but in humble walks of life--sometimes even by animals.\r\nGlossary. One of the benefits that should result from reading is the\r\nlearning of new words. At the end of the Discussion you will find\r\na list of words, the meaning of which you are to look up in the\r\nGlossary, and a second list that you should find out how to pronounce.\r\nMany of these words you may feel certain you know how to pronounce\r\ncorrectly. But perhaps you have been mispronouncing some of them. Look\r\nup in the glossary the words listed under question 9, and you may find\r\nthat you have been mispronouncing calm, hearth, or extraordinary. When\r\nyou are looking up words in the pronunciation lists, be sure that you\r\nunderstand the meaning, also. Besides the individual words that you do\r\nnot understand, you will sometimes read a phrase, or group of words,\r\nused in some special sense. The most striking are listed under the\r\ntopic Phrases for Study. Look them up in the Glossary, for you will\r\noften find the hardest passage of the reading lesson made easy by the\r\nexplanation of a single phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nBiography.

If a children\'s vote had been taken for the most popular\r\nanimal in the county, I believe that Jimmy would have been unanimously\r\nelected. If the grown people had held the election, however, it\r\nis certain that there would have been some votes against him. For\r\nexample, when Mr. W--, one of our neighbors, came home very late one\r\nnight, got into bed in the dark, and unwittingly kicked a bear cub\r\nthat had climbed in at a window earlier in the evening, of course he\r\nhad his toes nipped. That man would never have voted for Jimmy.\r\n\r\nNeither would the farmer\'s wife he met one evening coming from the\r\nbarn with a pail of new milk. The weather was warm, Jimmy was thirsty,\r\nand he was particularly fond of new milk. So he stood on his hind\r\nlegs, threw his arms around the pail, and sucked up half the contents\r\nbefore the good woman had recovered from her astonishment. But with\r\nthe children he was a great favorite. He was one of them, and they\r\nunderstood him. Like them he was full of fun and mischief, and he\r\nwould play as long as anyone cared to play with him.\r\n\r\nOne Christmas we gave a children\'s party, and perhaps a score of girls\r\nand boys came to spend the evening. As it was not possible to make\r\nJimmy understand about the party, he went to bed early, as usual, and\r\nwas asleep in his own den under the porch long before the first guests\r\narrived. He was not forgotten by his little friends, however, and\r\n"Where\'s Jimmy?" was the first question asked by almost every child as\r\nhe came in. But there was so much to chatter about, and there were so\r\nmany games to play, that absent comrades--even Jimmy--were soon out\r\nof mind.\r\n\r\nAt last supper was ready, and all the children trooped into the\r\ndining-room and took their places at the long table.\r\n\r\nFor a little while everyone was so busy that there was little to be\r\nheard except the clatter of forks and spoons and plates. I stood at\r\nthe end of the room, enjoying the fun. For the moment, my eyes were on\r\na small boy who seemed to be enjoying himself even more than the\r\nrest. He was making more noise than anyone else, and at the same time\r\nperforming remarkable sleight-of-mouth tricks with a large piece of\r\ncake and a plate of ice cream. Suddenly, I saw his face change. His\r\nlaugh was cut in two, his smile faded, the remains of the cake fell to\r\nhis plate, and a spoonful of ice cream, on its way to his open mouth,\r\nremained suspended in the air. He was facing a window, and as I\r\nfollowed his gaze, I saw a hairy black face, with a tawny muzzle and\r\na pair of small shining black eyes, looking eagerly into the room. It\r\nwas the bear cub, whose slumbers had been disturbed by the noise, and\r\nwho had come to see what it was all about.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the room was in an uproar. All the children left the\r\ntable at once, and crowded around the window yelling--"Jimmy!" "It\'s\r\nJimmy!" "Let him in!" "Don\'t you do it!" "Keep him out!" "Open the\r\nwindow!" "Give him some cake!" One little boy, with a piece of cake in\r\nhis hand, raised the window just a little. That was enough for Jimmy;\r\nhe thrust his strong muzzle under the sash, raised it with one jerk of\r\nhis head, and came tumbling into the room. How those children yelled\r\nand scattered! While they all thought it good fun to have the cub\r\nat the party, none of them knew just what he would do, and some;\r\nespecially among the younger ones, were decidedly nervous. A small\r\ngirl hid behind the window curtains, two little boys scurried upstairs\r\nand peeped through the banisters, and another, by means of a chair,\r\nscrambled to the top of a sideboard. But Jimmy had his own ideas about\r\na party. His first interest was in the supper table. Standing up on\r\nhis hind legs, he placed his forepaws on the cloth. Just in front of\r\nhim was a plate with some apple jelly on it. One sweep of his long\r\ntongue and the plate was almost as clean as if it had been washed.\r\nA dish of blancmange was the next to be gobbled up, and then a boy\r\nrather bolder than the rest made an attempt to save the cake. He\r\nseized the intruder by the skin of his neck, but except for a loud,\r\ngrumbling protest, the bear paid no attention to him. He walked right\r\nalong, pulling the boy with him, and one slice of cake after another\r\ndisappeared down the black throat. The little girl behind the\r\ncurtains, seeing that Jimmy did not intend to hurt anyone, came from\r\nher hiding place to try to help the boy who was holding him. Now\r\nthis little girl had been eating strawberry jam, and as little girls\r\nsometimes do, had left some of it on her lips. The moment she touched\r\nhim, Jimmy turned, and seeing and smelling the jam, he caught the\r\nchild in his short forearms, and in spite of her screams, licked her\r\nface all over before letting her go. Then he reached for the sugar\r\nbasin, lifted it from the table with his paws, and sat down on his\r\nhaunches to devour the contents.\r\n\r\nBy this time the children who had been nervous were quite at their\r\nease again, and gathered round to see him eat the sugar. In a few\r\nmoments he had satisfied his hunger, and was ready to play. First of\r\nall he acted as if he had lost his wits; or as if he wanted to "show\r\noff," which is about the same thing. He rolled over on his back,\r\nturned somersaults, and batted the chairs and the table legs with\r\nhis paws. The children got down on the floor to romp with him, and\r\ntogether they had a merry time.\r\n\r\nWhen they were all upon their feet again, Jimmy arose and stood\r\nperfectly straight on his hind legs. Then he picked out a girl about\r\nhis own height and took a step toward her, raising his paws as though\r\ninviting her to a boxing match. The girl accepted the challenge, and\r\nas she was strong, she held her own very well for a time. But as Jimmy\r\nwarmed up to his work, he became very rough and swung his heavy paws\r\nas hard as he could. At last he gave his playmate a stinging slap on\r\nthe side of her face, and she decided not to play any more. And as I\r\nthought that Jimmy had had about enough fun for one evening, I opened\r\nthe door, and he galloped off to his den under the porch.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nBiography.

Thither I went and hunted faithfully;\r\nthere was plenty of game of other kinds, but of bison not a trace did\r\nwe see. Nevertheless, a few days later that same year I came across\r\nthese great wild cattle at a time when I had no idea of seeing them.\r\n\r\nIt was, as nearly as we could tell, in Idaho, just south of the\r\nMontana boundary line, and some twenty-five miles west of the line of\r\nWyoming. We were camped high among the mountains, with a small pack\r\ntrain. On the day in question we had gone out to find moose, but had\r\nseen no sign of them, and had then begun to climb over the higher\r\npeaks with an idea of getting sheep. The old hunter who was with me\r\nwas, very fortunately, suffering from rheumatism, and he therefore\r\ncarried a long staff instead of his rifle; I say fortunately, for if\r\nhe had carried his rifle, it would have been impossible to stop his\r\nfiring at such game as bison, nor would he have spared the cows and\r\ncalves.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the afternoon we crossed a low, rocky ridge, and\r\nsaw at our feet a basin, or round valley, of singular beauty. Its\r\nwalls were formed by steep mountains. At its upper end lay a small\r\nlake, bordered on one side by a meadow of emerald green. The lake\'s\r\nother side marked the edge of the frowning pine forest which filled\r\nthe rest of the valley. Beyond the lake the ground rose in a pass much\r\nfrequented by game in bygone days, their trails lying along it in\r\nthick zigzags, each gradually fading out after a few hundred yards,\r\nand then starting again in a little different place, as game trails so\r\noften seem to do.\r\n\r\nWe bent our steps toward these trails, and no sooner had we reached\r\nthe first than the old hunter bent over it with a sharp exclamation of\r\nwonder. There in the dust, apparently but a few hours old, were the\r\nhoof-marks of a small band of bison. They were headed toward the lake.\r\nThere had been half a dozen animals in the party; one a big bull, and\r\ntwo calves.\r\n\r\nWe immediately turned and followed the trail. It led down to the\r\nlittle lake, where the beasts had spread and grazed on the tender,\r\ngreen blades, and had drunk their fill. The footprints then came\r\ntogether again, showing where the animals had gathered and walked off\r\nin single file to the forest. Evidently they had come to the pool in\r\nthe early morning, and after drinking and feeding had moved into the\r\nforest to find some spot for their noontide rest.\r\n\r\nIt was a very still day, and there were nearly three hours of daylight\r\nleft. Without a word my silent companion, who had been scanning the\r\nwhole country with hawk-eyed eagerness, took the trail, motioning\r\nme to follow. In a moment we entered the woods, breathing a sigh of\r\nrelief as we did so; for while in the meadow we could never tell that\r\nthe buffalo might not see us, if they happened to be lying in some\r\nplace with a commanding lookout.\r\n\r\nIt was not very long before we struck the day-beds, which were made\r\non a knoll, where the forest was open, and where there was much down\r\ntimber. After leaving the day-beds the animals had at first fed\r\nseparately around the grassy base and sides of the knoll, and had then\r\nmade off in their usual single file, going straight to a small pool in\r\nthe forest. After drinking they had left this pool and traveled down\r\ntoward the mouth of the basin, the trail leading along the sides of\r\nthe steep hill, which were dotted by open glades. Here we moved with\r\ncaution, for the sign had grown very fresh, and the animals had once\r\nmore scattered and begun feeding. When the trail led across the\r\nglades, we usually skirted them so as to keep in the timber.\r\n\r\nAt last, on nearing the edge of one of these glades, we saw a movement\r\namong the young trees on the other side, not fifty yards away. Peering\r\nthrough some thick evergreen bushes, we speedily made out three bison,\r\na cow, a calf, and a yearling, grazing greedily on the other side of\r\nthe glade. Soon another cow and calf stepped out after them. I did not\r\nwish to shoot, waiting for the appearance of the big bull which I knew\r\nwas accompanying them.\r\n\r\nSo for several minutes I watched the great, clumsy, shaggy beasts, as\r\nthey grazed in the open glade. Mixed with the eager excitement of\r\nthe hunter was a certain half-melancholy feeling as I gazed on these\r\nbison, themselves part of the last remnant of a nearly vanished race.\r\nFew, indeed, are the men who now have, or evermore shall have, the\r\nchance of seeing the mightiest of American beasts in all his wild\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\nAt last, when I had begun to grow very anxious lest the others should\r\ntake alarm, the bull likewise appeared on the edge of the glade, and\r\nstood with outstretched head, scratching his throat against a young\r\ntree, which shook violently. I aimed low, behind his shoulder, and\r\npulled the trigger. At the crack of the rifle all the bison turned\r\nand raced off at headlong speed. The fringe of young pines beyond and\r\nbelow the glade cracked and swayed as if a whirlwind were passing,\r\nand in another moment the bison reached the top of a steep incline,\r\nthickly strewn with boulders and dead reckless speed; the timber. Down\r\nthis they plunged with surefootedness was a marvel. A column of dust\r\nobscured their passage, and under its cover they disappeared in the\r\nforest; but the trail of the bull was marked by splashes of frothy\r\nblood, and we followed it at a trot. Fifty yards beyond the border\r\nof the forest we found the black body stretched motionless. He was a\r\nsplendid old bull, still in his full vigor, with large, sharp horns,\r\nand heavy mane and glossy coat; and I felt the most exulting pride as\r\nI handled and examined him; for I had procured a trophy such as can\r\nfall henceforth to few hunters indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography.

Bailey\r\n\r\n\r\nThe springtime belongs to the birds and me. We own it. We know when\r\nthe mayflowers and the buttercups bloom. We know when the first frogs\r\npeep. We watch the awakening of the woods. We are wet by the warm\r\nApril showers. We go where we will, and we are companions. Every tree\r\nand brook and blade of grass is ours; and our hearts are full of song.\r\n\r\nThere are boys who kill the birds, and girls who want to catch them\r\nand put them into cages, and there are others who steal their eggs.\r\nThe birds are not partners with them; they are only servants. Birds,\r\nlike people, sing for their friends, not for their masters. I am sure\r\nthat one cannot think much of the springtime and the flowers if his\r\nheart is always set upon killing or catching something. We are happy\r\nwhen we are free, and so are the birds.\r\n\r\nThe birds and I get acquainted all over again every spring. They have\r\nseen strange lands in the winter, and all the brooks and woods have\r\nbeen covered with snow. So we run and romp together, and find all the\r\nnooks and crannies which we had half-forgotten since October. The\r\nbirds remember the old places. The wrens pull the sticks from the old\r\nhollow rail and seem to be wild with joy to see the place again. They\r\nmust be the same wrens that were here last year, for strangers could\r\nnot make so much fuss over an old rail. The bluebirds and wrens look\r\ninto every crack and corner for a place in which to build, and the\r\nrobins and chirping-sparrows explore every tree in the old orchard.\r\n\r\nIf the birds want to live with us, we should encourage them. The first\r\nthing to do is to leave them alone. Let them be as free from danger\r\nand fear as you and I. Take the hammer off the old gun, give pussy so\r\nmuch to eat that she will not care to hunt for birds, and keep away\r\nthe boys who steal eggs and who carry sling-shots and throw stones.\r\nPlant trees and bushes about the borders of the place, and let some of\r\nthem, at least, grow into tangles; then, even in the back yard, the\r\nwary catbird may make its home.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nBiography.

Several interesting persons\r\nwill appear and will show you that a small part of the joy of reading\r\nconsists in the merry tales that you may find in books. One of the\r\nEnglish poets somewhere calls upon the spirits of fun and joy, a\r\ncheerful nymph and her companions, to drive dull care away. This poet,\r\nJohn Milton by name, wrote many poems and prose works on very serious\r\nmatters. He lived in a serious time, the time when many Englishmen\r\nwere leaving their native country and emigrating to America in order\r\nthat they might find a freedom that was denied to them at home.\r\n\r\nBut even under these circumstances, sympathizing with those who went\r\ninto exile for freedom, and studying night and day how he could\r\nhimself advance the cause of liberty, John Milton was too great a man\r\nto believe that life is altogether serious and earnest. Humor and\r\njesting and wholesome fun have a part in every life; they are no more\r\nto be neglected than the spices in a Thanksgiving pie. So the poet\r\ncalled upon the cheerful nymph and her attendants to help him see the\r\nbrighter side of life; the fun that there is in foolishness, and the\r\nhealth that comes with a hearty laugh. Here is what he wrote:\r\n\r\n    "Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee\r\n    Jest and youthful Jollity,\r\n\r\n    Come, and trip it, as you go,\r\n    On the light, fantastic toe."\r\n\r\nNow let us imagine that we, also, are inviting these kindly spirits of\r\nMirth. Our lives are serious, too. We have arithmetic to learn, or\r\nwe have a composition to write. People expect us to do all sorts of\r\nthings that take our time, and of course we want to do these things.\r\nBut here comes Laughter holding both his sides, a fat old gentleman\r\nwho makes you feel merry the moment you set eyes on him. And Father\r\nLaughter first introduces the Baron Munchausen, who will tell some\r\nof his marvelous experiences. We are not compelled to believe all of\r\nthem. Perhaps Father Laughter wanted to take a sly dig or two at the\r\nyarns some travelers tell when they get home. By this means the story\r\nillustrates one of the great sources of humor--monstrous exaggeration.\r\nIt also shows what a foolish thing it is to be a boaster. Most people,\r\nat one time or another, are tempted to brag about their deeds, their\r\npossessions, or their smartness. If they would only think of Baron\r\nMunchausen, they would flee from this temptation.\r\n\r\nAfter this comes a story about the blind men and the elephant. Here\r\nFather Laughter gets his way with you by making you see how absurd\r\nwere the guesses about the elephant made by men who knew only the\r\nanimal\'s trunk, or his tusks, or his tail. And here, too, after you\r\nhave laughed heartily at the foolish fellows who were so positive that\r\nthey knew everything when they knew nothing, you begin to see the\r\ndanger in what are called "snap judgments." "Look at these ridiculous\r\nfellows," says Father Laughter, "and consider how silly it is to jump\r\nto a conclusion unless you have all the facts."\r\n\r\nYou will agree that Father Laughter\'s next performer, Darius Green, is\r\nespecially interesting in these days when men fly across the Atlantic\r\nor from New York to San Francisco. Darius seems to have been the first\r\n"bird-man," and though he was absurd enough, he reminds one of the\r\nfact that many useful inventions that now add to our comfort were\r\nprepared for by men who seemed to their friends and acquaintances\r\ncrazy enough.\r\n\r\nBut this is introduction a-plenty; there\'s really no need to keep you\r\nany longer from getting acquainted with Father Laughter and the antics\r\nhe likes to play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN\r\n\r\nR. E. Raspe\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Savage Boar\r\n\r\nBaron Munchausen had feasted his friends right well, and after supper\r\nhe leaned back in his chair and said, "So you want me to tell you of\r\nmy adventures in the past." His guests eagerly urged him on, and he\r\nbegan his story.\r\n\r\nOnce, when I was returning from a hunt, with an empty gun (having used\r\nall my ammunition), a raging wild boar rushed at me. Well, you know\r\nhow unpleasant such an encounter may be, so I am sure none of you will\r\nthink me a coward for hastily climbing the nearest tree; it was a\r\nyoung birch which could hardly bear my weight. The boar made a dash\r\nfor the tree, but was a moment too late, for I had just drawn my legs\r\nout of his reach. But so violent was his rush that his tusks went\r\nthrough the trunk of the tree and projected an inch through the other\r\nside. I slid down the tree, picked up a stone the size of my fist, and\r\nriveted down the projecting points of the tusks. You can imagine what\r\na narrow escape I had when I tell you that the beast weighed five\r\ntons--a good deal for a wild boar."\r\n\r\n\r\nA Narrow Escape\r\n\r\n"At another time, when I was hunting in Ceylon, I was terrified to see\r\na gigantic lion approaching, with the evident intention of devouring\r\nme. My gun was only loaded with bird-shot, and I had no other about\r\nme. The savage animal shook his head several times, uttered a loud\r\nroar, and prepared to spring. I turned to flee, and--my flesh creeps\r\neven now at the recollection of it--there, on the bank of a river that\r\nlay behind me, was a huge crocodile with his terrible jaws open ready\r\nto swallow me!\r\n\r\n"Imagine, gentlemen, the horror of my situation--before me the lion,\r\nbehind me the crocodile, on my left a rushing torrent, and on the\r\nright an abyss full of poisonous snakes! I gave myself up for lost,\r\nand fell to the ground in an almost fainting condition, expecting\r\nnothing better than to meet with a horrible death from one or the\r\nother of these terrible animals.\r\n\r\n"After waiting a few seconds I heard a violent noise, different from\r\nany that had fallen on my ears before. I ventured to raise my head,\r\nand what do you think had happened?\r\n\r\n"The lion had, in his eagerness, jumped clean over me into the\r\ncrocodile\'s jaws; the head of the one stuck in the throat of the\r\nother, and they were struggling to free themselves. I quickly sprang\r\nto my feet, drew out my hunting-knife, and with one blow severed the\r\nlion\'s head. Then, with the butt-end of my gun, I rammed the head\r\nfarther into the throat of the crocodile, and destroyed him by\r\nsuffocation. The hide of the crocodile, which was exactly forty\r\nfeet in length, I had stuffed, and it now forms one of the chief\r\nattractions in the museum at Amsterdam, where the superintendent\r\nrelates the story to all spectators, with harrowing additions.\r\n\r\n"One of these is that the lion jumped right through the crocodile,\r\nbut as soon as the head appeared, Monsieur the Famous Baron (as he is\r\npleased to call me) cut it off, and three feet of the crocodile\'s tail\r\nas well, whereupon the crocodile turned round, snatched the knife out\r\nof my hand, and swallowed it so greedily that it pierced his heart and\r\nkilled him!\r\n\r\n"I need not tell you how annoyed I was by these exaggerations. In\r\nthis age of doubt people who do not know me might possibly be led to\r\ndisbelieve the real facts when they are mixed up with such absurd\r\ninventions.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE BARON SAVED GIBRALTAR\r\n\r\n\r\n"Some years later I made a voyage to Gibraltar to visit my old friend,\r\nGeneral Elliott. He received me with joy and took me for a stroll\r\nalong the ramparts to examine the operations of the enemy. I had\r\nbrought with me an excellent telescope, which I had purchased in Rome.\r\nLooking through it, I saw that the enemy were about to discharge a\r\nthirty-six pound cannon at the very spot where we were standing. I\r\nrushed toward our nearest cannon, a forty-eight pounder, and placed it\r\nexactly facing that of the enemy. I watched carefully till I saw the\r\nSpanish gunner apply a match to the touchhole, and then I, too, gave\r\nthe word \'Fire.\'\r\n\r\n"Both reports rang out at the same instant, and the two cannon balls\r\nmet halfway with amazing force. Ours, being the heavier, caused the\r\nenemy\'s ball to recoil with such violence as to kill the man who had\r\ndischarged it; it then passed through the masts of three ships which\r\nlay in a line behind each other, and flew across the Straits of\r\nGibraltar some miles into Africa. Our own ball, after repelling the\r\nother, proceeded on its way, dismounted the very cannon which had just\r\nbeen used against us, and forced it into the hold of the ship, where\r\nit fell with so much force as to break its way through the bottom.\r\nThe ship immediately filled and sank, with about a thousand Spanish\r\nsailors and a large number of soldiers on board, who were all drowned.\r\n\r\n"You can see for yourselves that this strange tale must be true,\r\nhowever improbable it sounds, or else how could it possibly have\r\nhappened?"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nA long time ago a book called The Travels of Baron Munchausen was\r\nwritten by Rudolph Erich Raspe.

Green;\r\n    The son of a farmer--age fourteen.\r\n    His body was long and lank and lean--\r\n    Just right for flying, as will be seen;\r\n    He had two eyes, each bright as a bean,\r\n    And a freckled nose that grew between,\r\n    A little awry--for I must mention\r\n    That he had riveted his attention\r\n    Upon his wonderful invention,\r\n    Twisting his tongue as he twisted the strings,\r\n    Working his face as he worked the wings,\r\n    Arid with every turn of gimlet and screw\r\n    Turning and screwing his mouth round, too,\r\n    Till his nose seemed bent\r\n    To catch the scent,\r\n    Around some corner, of new-baked pies,\r\n    And his wrinkled cheeks and his squinting eyes\r\n    Grew puckered into a queer grimace,\r\n    That made him look very droll in the face,\r\n    And also very wise.\r\n\r\n    And wise he must have been, to do more\r\n    Than ever a genius did before,\r\n    Excepting Daedalus of yore\r\n    And his son Icarus, who wore\r\n    Upon their backs\r\n    Those wings of wax\r\n    He had read of in the old almanacs.\r\n    Darius was clearly of the opinion\r\n    That the air is also man\'s dominion,\r\n    And that, with paddle or fin or pinion,\r\n    We soon or late\r\n    Shall navigate\r\n    The azure as now we sail the sea.\r\n    The thing looks simple enough to me;\r\n    And if you doubt it,\r\n    Hear how Darius reasoned about it.\r\n\r\n    "Birds can fly,\r\n    An\' why can\'t I?\r\n    Must we give in,"\r\n    Says he with a grin,\r\n    "\'T the bluebird an\' phoebe\r\n    Are smarter\'n we be?\r\n    Jest fold our hands an\' see the swaller\r\n    An\' blackbird an\' catbird beat us holler?\r\n    Does the leetle, chatterin\', sassy wren,\r\n    No bigger\'n my thumb, know more than men\r\n    Jest show me that!\r\n    Er prove\'t the bat\r\n    Has got more brains than\'s in my hat,\r\n    An\' I\'ll back down, an\' not till then!"\r\n\r\n    He argued further: "Ner I can\'t see\r\n    What\'s th\' use o\' wings to a bumblebee,\r\n    Fer to git a livin\' with, more\'n to me;\r\n    Ain\'t my business\r\n    Importanter\'n his\'n is?\r\n    That Icarus\r\n    Was a silly cuss--\r\n    Him an\' his daddy, Daedalus.\r\n    They might \'a\' knowed wings made o\' wax\r\n    Wouldn\'t stan\' sun-heat an\' hard whacks;\r\n    I\'ll make mine o\' luther,\r\n    Er suthin\' er other."\r\n\r\n    And he said to himself, as he tinkered and planned:\r\n    "But I ain\'t goin\' to show my hand\r\n    To mummies that never can understand\r\n    The fust idee that\'s big an\' grand.\r\n    They\'d \'a\' laft an\' made fun\r\n    O\' Creation itself afore \'twas done!"\r\n    So he kept his secret from all the rest,\r\n    Safely buttoned within his vest;\r\n    And in the loft above the shed\r\n    Himself he locks, With thimble and thread\r\n    And wax and hammer and buckles and screws,\r\n    And all such things as geniuses use;\r\n    Two bats for patterns, curious fellows!\r\n    A charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows;\r\n    An old hoop-skirt or two, as Well as\r\n    Some wire and several old umbrellas;\r\n    A carriage-cover, for tail and wings;\r\n    A piece of harness; and straps and strings;\r\n    And a big strong box,\r\n    In which he locks\r\n    These and a hundred other things.\r\n\r\n    His grinning brothers, Reuben and Burke\r\n    And Nathan and Jotham and Solomon, lurk\r\n    Around the corner to see him work--\r\n    Sitting cross-legged, like a Turk,\r\n    Drawing the waxed end through with a jerk,\r\n    And boring the holes with a comical quirk\r\n    Of his wise old head, and a knowing smirk.\r\n    But vainly they mounted each other\'s backs,\r\n    And poked through knot-holes and pried through cracks;\r\n    With wood from the pile and straw from the stacks\r\n    He plugged the knot-holes and calked the cracks;\r\n    And a bucket of water, which one would think;\r\n    He had brought up into the loft to drink\r\n    When he chanced to be dry,\r\n    Stood always nigh,\r\n    For Darius was sly!\r\n    And whenever at work he happened to spy\r\n    At chink or crevice a blinking eye,\r\n    He let a dipper of water fly.\r\n    "Take that! an\' ef ever ye get a peep,\r\n    Guess ye\'ll ketch a weasel asleep!"\r\n    And he sings as he locks\r\n    His big strong box:\r\n    "The weasel\'s head is small an\' trim,\r\n    An\' he is leetle an\' long an\' slim,\r\n    An\' quick of motion an\' nimble of limb,\r\n    An\' ef yeou\'ll be\r\n    Advised by me,\r\n    Keep wide awake when ye\'re ketchin\' him!"\r\n\r\n    So day after day\r\n    He stitched and tinkered and hammered\r\n    Till at last \'twas done--\r\n    The greatest invention under the sun!\r\n    "An\' now," says Darius, "hooray fer some fun!"\r\n\r\n    \'Twas the Fourth of July,\r\n    And the weather was dry,\r\n    And not a cloud was on all the sky\r\n    Save a few light fleeces, which here and there.\r\n    Half mist, half air,\r\n    Like foam on the ocean went floating by;\r\n    Just as lovely a morning as ever was seen\r\n    For a nice little trip in a flying-machine.\r\n\r\n    Thought cunning Darius: "Now I shan\'t go\r\n    Along \'ith the fellers to see the show.\r\n    I\'ll say I\'ve got sich a terrible cough!\r\n    An\' then, when the folks \'ave all gone off,\r\n    I\'ll hev full swing\r\n    For to try the thing,\r\n    An\' practyse a leetle on the wing."\r\n\r\n    "Ain\'t goin\' to see the celebration?"\r\n    Says Brother Nate.  "No; botheration!\r\n    I\'ve got sich a cold--a toothache--I--\r\n    My gracious!--feel\'s though I should fly!"\r\n\r\n    Said Jotham, "Sho!\r\n    Guess ye better go."\r\n    But Darius said, "No!\r\n    Shouldn\'t wonder \'f yeou might see me, though,\r\n    \'Long \'bout noon, ef I git red\r\n    O\' this jumpin\', thumpin\' pain \'n my head."\r\n\r\n    For all the while to himself he said:\r\n    "I\'ll tell ye what!\r\n    I\'ll fly a few times around the lot,\r\n    To see how \'t seems; then soon\'s I\'ve got\r\n    The hang o\' the thing, ez likely\'s not,\r\n    I\'ll astonish the nation,\r\n    And all creation,\r\n    By flyin\' over the celebration!\r\n    Over their heads I\'ll sail like an eagle;\r\n    I\'ll balance myself on my wings like a sea-gull;\r\n    I\'ll dance on the chimbleys; I\'ll stan\' on the steeple;\r\n    I\'ll flop up to winders an\' scare the people!\r\n\r\n    I\'ll light on the libbe\'ty-pole, an\' crow;\r\n    An\' I\'ll say to the gawpin\' fools below,\r\n    \'What world\'s this \'ere\r\n    That I\'ve come near?\'\r\n    Fer I\'ll make \'em believe I\'m a chap f\'m the moon!\r\n    An\' I\'ll try a race \'ith their ol\' bulloon."\r\n    He crept from his bed;\r\n    And, seeing the others were gone, he said,\r\n    "I\'m a gittin\' over the cold \'n my head."\r\n    And away he sped\r\n    To open the wonderful box in the shed.\r\n\r\n    His brothers had walked but a little way\r\n    When Jotham to Nathan chanced to say,\r\n    "What on airth is he up to, hey?"\r\n    "Don\'o\'--the\' \'s suthin\' er other to pay,\r\n    Er he wouldn\'t \'a\' stayed to hum today."\r\n    Says Burke, "His toothache\'s all \'n his eye!\r\n    He never\'d miss a Fo\'th-o\'-July\r\n    Ef he hedn\'t got some machine to try.\r\n    Le\'s hurry back an\' hide in the barn,\r\n    An\' pay him fer tellin\' us that yarn!"\r\n    "Agreed!"  Through the orchard they creep back,\r\n    Along by the fences, behind the stack,\r\n    And one by one, through a hole in the wall,\r\n    In under the dusty barn they crawl,\r\n    Dressed in their Sunday garments all;\r\n    And a very astonishing sight was that,\r\n    When each in his cobwebbed coat and hat\r\n    Came up through the floor like an ancient rat\r\n    And there they hid;\r\n    And Reuben slid\r\n    The fastenings back, and the door undid.\r\n    "Keep dark!" said he,\r\n    "While I squint an\' see what the\' is to see."\r\n\r\n    As knights of old put on their mail--\r\n    From head to foot\r\n    An iron suit,\r\n    Iron jacket and iron boot,\r\n    Iron breeches, and on the head\r\n    No hat, but an iron pot instead,\r\n    And under the chin the bail\r\n    (I believe they called the thing a helm);\r\n    And the lid they carried they called a shield;\r\n    And, thus accoutered, they took the field,\r\n    Sallying forth to overwhelm\r\n    The dragons and pagans that plagued the realm--\r\n    So this modern knight\r\n    Prepared for flight,\r\n    Put on his wings and strapped them tight;\r\n    Jointed and jaunty, strong and light;\r\n    Buckled them fast to shoulder and hip--\r\n    Ten feet they measured from tip to tip!\r\n    And a helm had he, but that he wore,\r\n    Not on his head like those of yore,\r\n    But more like the helm of a ship.\r\n\r\n    "Hush!"  Reuben said,\r\n    "He\'s up in the shed!\r\n    He\'s opened the winder--I see his head!\r\n    He stretches it out,\r\n    An\' pokes it about,\r\n    Lookin\' to see \'f the coast is clear,\r\n    An\' nobody near;\r\n    Guess he don\'o\' who\'s hid in here!\r\n    He\'s riggin\' a spring-board over the sill!\r\n    Stop laffin\', Solomon!

Upon his crown,\r\n    In the midst of the barnyard, he came down,\r\n    In a wonderful whirl of tangled strings,\r\n    Broken braces and broken springs,\r\n    Broken tail and broken wings,\r\n    Shooting-stars, and various things!\r\n    Away with a bellow fled the calf,\r\n    And what was that?  Did the gosling laugh?\r\n    \'Tis a merry roar\r\n    From the old barn-door,\r\n    And he hears the voice of Jotham crying,\r\n    "Say, D\'rius! how de yeou like flyin\'?"\r\n    Slowly, ruefully, where he lay,\r\n    Darius just turned and looked that way,\r\n    As he stanched his sorrowful nose with his cuff.\r\n    "Wal, I like flyin\' well enough,"\r\n    He said; "but the\' ain\'t sich a thunderin\' sight\r\n    O\' fun in \'t when ye come to light."\r\n\r\n\r\n    MORAL\r\n\r\n    I just have room for the moral here,\r\n    And this is the moral: Stick to your sphere.\r\n    Or if you insist, as you have the right,\r\n    On spreading your wings for a loftier flight,\r\n    The moral is: Take care how you light.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nBiography.

L. DODGSON ("Lewis Carroll") Christ Church,\r\nOxford October 13, 1875\r\n\r\nMy Dear Gertrude:\r\n\r\nI never give birthday presents, but you see I do sometimes write a\r\nbirthday letter; so, as I\'ve just arrived here, I am writing this to\r\nwish you many and many a happy return of your birthday tomorrow. I\r\nwill drink your health, if only I can remember, and if you don\'t\r\nmind--but perhaps you object? You see, if I were to sit by you at\r\nbreakfast, and to drink your tea, you wouldn\'t like that, would you?\r\nYou would say "Boo! hoo! Here\'s Mr. Dodgson\'s drunk all my tea, and I\r\nhaven\'t any left!" So I am very much afraid, next time Sybil looks for\r\nyou, she\'ll find you sitting by the sad sea-wave, and crying "Boo!\r\nhoo! Here\'s Mr. Dodgson has drunk my health, and I haven\'t got any\r\nleft!" And how it will puzzle Dr. Maund, when he is sent for to see\r\nyou! "My dear Madam, I\'m very sorry to say your little girl has got no\r\nhealth at all! I never saw such a thing in my life!" "Oh, I can easily\r\nexplain it!" your mother will say. "You see she would go and make\r\nfriends with a strange gentleman, and yesterday he drank her health!"\r\n"Well, Mrs. Chataway," he will say, "the only way to cure her is to\r\nwait till his next birthday, and then for her to drink his health."\r\n\r\nAnd then we shall have changed healths. I wonder how you\'ll like mine!\r\nOh, Gertrude, I wish you wouldn\'t talk such nonsense!\r\n\r\nYour loving friend,\r\n\r\nLEWIS CARROLL\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898), better known by his\r\npen name, "Lewis Carroll," was an English author. He was the son of\r\na clergyman. For four years he attended the famous school at Rugby,\r\nafter which he entered college at Oxford. He became an excellent\r\nscholar and mathematician and was appointed a lecturer on mathematics\r\nat Oxford University, a position that he held for many years. His keen\r\nsympathy with the imagination of children and their sense of fun led\r\nhim to tell of the adventures of Alice, in a book called Alice\'s\r\nAdventures in Wonderland. This book made Lewis Carroll\'s name famous.\r\nHis delightful humor is well illustrated in his letter of "Birthday\r\nGreetings" to Gertrude Chataway.\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1. What is usually meant by "drink your health"? 2. What\r\nplay on the meaning of these words gives a humorous turn to them? 3.\r\nWhat remedy does the author suggest the doctor will prescribe for\r\nGertrude? 4. What does the author call this humor? 5.

"I\'ve done for that Moon."\r\n\r\n    He turned in his bed; she was there again.\r\n    On high in the sky,\r\n    With her one ghost eye,\r\n    The Moon shone white and alive and plain.\r\n    Said the Wind, "I will blow you out again."\r\n\r\n    The Wind blew hard, and the Moon grew dim.\r\n    "With my sledge and my wedge\r\n    I have knocked off her edge.\r\n    If only I blow right fierce and grim,\r\n    The creature will soon be dimmer than dim."\r\n\r\n    He blew and he blew, and she thinned to a thread.\r\n    "One puff more\'s enough\r\n    To blow her to snuff!\r\n    One good puff more where the last was bred,\r\n    And glimmer, glimmer glum will go the thread."\r\n\r\n    He blew a great blast, and the thread was gone;\r\n    In the air nowhere\r\n    Was a moonbeam bare;\r\n    Far off and harmless the shy stars shone;\r\n    Sure and certain the Moon was gone!\r\n\r\n    The Wind he took to his revels once more:\r\n    On down, in town,\r\n    Like a merry-mad clown,\r\n    He leaped and hallooed with whistle and roar--\r\n    "What\'s that?"  The glimmering thread once more.\r\n\r\n    He flew in a rage--he danced and blew;\r\n    But in vain was the pain\r\n    Of his bursting brain;\r\n    For still the broader the moon-scrap grew,\r\n    The broader he swelled his big cheeks and blew.\r\n\r\n    Slowly she grew--till she filled the night,\r\n    And shone on her throne\r\n    In the sky alone,\r\n    A matchless, wonderful, silvery light,\r\n    Radiant and lovely, the queen of the night.\r\n\r\n    Said the Wind: "What a marvel of power am I\r\n    With my breath, good faith,\r\n    I blew her to death--\r\n    First blew her away right out of the sky--\r\n    Then blew her in; what a strength am I!"\r\n\r\n    But the Moon she knew nothing about the affair,\r\n    For, high in the sky,\r\n    With her one white eye,\r\n    Motionless, miles above the air,\r\n    She had never heard the great Wind blare.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nBiography.

An interesting anecdote is told of\r\nAbraham Lincoln that shows how he would have answered this question.\r\nOne day when the Civil War was at its height, President Lincoln opened\r\nhis cabinet meeting by saying, "Gentlemen, I am going to read you\r\nsomething that will make you laugh." He then read a chapter from a\r\nhumorous book, laughing heartily as he read. When he saw that none\r\nof the members of his cabinet joined in the laughter, he said with a\r\nsigh, "Gentlemen, why don\'t you laugh? With the fearful strain that is\r\nput on me day and night, if I did not laugh once in a while I should\r\ndie; and you need this medicine as much as I do," What did you read\r\nin the Forward Look on page 57 about another serious-minded man who\r\nbelieved that wholesome humor is a "medicine"?\r\n\r\nWhich selection in this group gave you the heartiest laugh? Often\r\nsome sensible truth is taught through a little nonsense; of which\r\nselections is this particularly true? It is interesting to stop for a\r\nmoment and think just why certain stories make us laugh. One story is\r\nhumorous because of its wild exaggeration; another because it makes us\r\nsee how ridiculous it is to be a boaster or to be conceited or to jump\r\nat conclusions; and still another because it has an interesting little\r\nplay upon words. What is the source of humor in "The Savage Boar"; "A\r\nNarrow Escape"; "How the Baron Saved Gibraltar"; "The Blind Men and\r\nthe Elephant"; "Birthday Greetings"; "The Wind and the Moon"?\r\n\r\nHow does the present-day newspaper furnish fun for its readers? Which\r\nnewspaper cartoons do you look at regularly, and which are your\r\nfavorites? Bring to class examples of cartoons, and then divide the\r\ncollection into three groups--those that you think drive home a truth;\r\nthose that you think are funny and clever; and those that you think\r\nare merely silly. Prepare an exhibit for "Cartoon Day" in your school,\r\nselecting the material from these examples.

He saw how men from other countries looked\r\nupon their homelands with pride and affection, and how his countrymen\r\nloved America better even than their lives. He came to be known as\r\n"the man without a country," and he lived a wretched and lonely life.\r\nAt last he came to the hour of death, and he wrote these words for all\r\nAmericans to think about if the temptation should ever come to speak\r\nscornfully of their country:\r\n\r\n"If you are ever tempted to say a word or to do a thing that shall put\r\na bar between you and your country, pray God in his mercy to take you\r\nthat instant home to his own heaven. Stick by your family, boy; forget\r\nyou have a self, while you do everything for them. Think of your home,\r\nboy; write and send, and talk about it. Let it be nearer and nearer to\r\nyour thoughts, the farther you have to travel from it; and rush back\r\nto it when you are free. And for your country, boy"--and the words\r\nrattled in his throat--"and for that flag"--and he pointed to the\r\nship--"never dream a dream but of serving her as she bids you, though\r\nthe service carry you through a thousand hells. No matter what happens\r\nto you, no matter who flatters you or who abuses you, never look to\r\nanother flag, never let a night pass but you pray God to bless that\r\nflag. Remember, boy, that behind all these men you have to do with,\r\nbehind officers, and government, and people even, there is the Country\r\nHerself, your Country, and that you belong to Her as you belong to\r\nyour mother. Stand by Her, boy, as you would stand by your mother."\r\n\r\nSuch was the dying message of "the man without a country" to the\r\nAmericans of his time; such is his message to us. When we were at\r\nwar, it was to be expected that all men would answer the call of\r\npatriotism. But now that peace has come, it is not so easy to forget\r\nself in a loyalty to our country and its flag. It is easy to be on\r\nguard when we know that an armed enemy is close by; it is not easy\r\nwhen the enemy is hidden, and the guns are silent. These hidden\r\nenemies of our country do not fight in armies; they are the bad\r\ncitizens who are scattered about; often you do not realize who they\r\nare.\r\n\r\nGenerally these bad citizens, who are enemies of our country, possess\r\none or all of the following characteristics:\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they have no love for home and its festivals. Now,\r\nour nation is a collection of homes. The government was formed to\r\nprotect these homes. The good citizen is a lover of his native soil,\r\na lover of his home, a lover of Thanksgiving and Independence Day and\r\nChristmas. These festivals bind men more closely together, make them\r\none, join them to their native land. But there are many bad citizens,\r\nenemies of America, who seek to destroy these influences that lead\r\nmen to work together to make the community a better place in which to\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nSecond, the history of the United States, the stories of the founding\r\nof our nation, the stories about our flag and its defenders, have no\r\ninterest for these bad citizens. You remember how mother used to tell\r\nyou stories about when she was a little girl, and how these stories\r\nmade you love her the more. It is the same with the stories about\r\nthe days when our country was young: how the young George Washington\r\nshowed the kind of man he was, or how the young Abraham Lincoln\r\nstruggled to fit himself to become a leader of men. Through these\r\nstories we learn what the flag really means and what it has cost, and\r\nwe love our country as we love our mother. But the enemy, the bad\r\ncitizen, laughs at these things. He just thinks of himself. He thinks\r\nhe has a right to do as he likes because this is, he says, "a free\r\ncountry." He doesn\'t think that he owes anything to Washington and\r\nJefferson and Lincoln, or to those who kept the flag at the masthead\r\nwhen it was in peril.\r\n\r\nAnd the third test of a man\'s loyalty to our country is met only if\r\nhe has the true feeling of democracy in his heart. This feeling of\r\ndemocracy means service, willingness to help others. The man or woman\r\nwho thinks only of his own good time or his own fortune is a bad\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nYou see, it is this way. In olden times men had no part in the\r\ngovernment unless they were born into a high place in society. The\r\nordinary man did as he was told, went to the wars at the king\'s\r\npleasure, and paid taxes that often took all he could save. He had\r\nlittle opportunity to make money or collect property. If he did, very\r\nprobably the king would hear of it and would take away from him all\r\nthat he had saved. But America was founded with a different idea of\r\nthese matters. Here men got together and set up the kind of government\r\nthey wished. They taxed themselves in order to support this\r\ngovernment. They worked together to drive away hostile Indians, to\r\nkill wild beasts, to conquer the forests, to plant their crops, to\r\nmake their lives safe and happy. In this cooperation, or working\r\ntogether, in government and in all the ways of living we find the\r\nspirit of democracy.\r\n\r\nThis spirit has made America what it is today. It has opened up farms,\r\nbuilt railways and ships and great industries, built also mighty\r\ncities, and made laws for the protection of property and life. All\r\nthis men have done through the cooperation that means democracy.\r\n\r\nIf any man thinks that this freedom gives him the right to trample on\r\nothers, he is no better than one of the wicked kings of former times.\r\nIf he thinks that under this freedom he may devote himself wholly to\r\nthe selfish gain of wealth without giving a share of his money, his\r\ntime, and his skill to making his community a better place to live\r\nin and his nation stronger and more secure, he cheats his fellows,\r\nbecause he takes, without making any return, the blessings that the\r\nfounders and defenders of the Republic established with their lives.\r\n\r\nIn the old stories the youth who was ready to be made a knight had to\r\ndo certain things. He had to take the vow of knighthood, that he would\r\nlead a pure and blameless life. He had to render a service to someone\r\nin distress. And he had to watch, his arms beside him, through a\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nYou boys and girls, lovers of America, her defenders if need be, her\r\nguardians in the years to come, must also watch by your arms. These\r\narms are not guns and bayonets; they belong to your heart and mind.\r\nThey are three in number: the love of home, the inheritance of\r\nfreedom, and the will to work with others. The first is a foundation\r\nto make strong your heart; the second is a bulwark to make safe your\r\nlife; the third is a sword wherewith to slay the enemies of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThis foundation in the love of home, this bulwark of our inheritance\r\nof freedom, and this sword of unselfish service are subjects often\r\ndealt with by great writers. In the pages that follow you will find\r\npieces selected in order to bring out these ideas. You should read\r\neach of these selections not only for itself but also as a member of\r\nthe group to which it belongs; and you should try to get the central\r\nidea that unites all the pieces that make up the group. Thus, little\r\nby little, you will come to see how your joy in Thanksgiving, the\r\nthrill that Old Glory can give you, and the service that you can\r\nrender to someone else, are all related to each other. To defend home\r\nand country by being a good citizen is to be your mission in life. It\r\nis more important than a successful career, or than great personal\r\nhappiness. For both your career and your happiness will depend upon\r\nthe way in which you, and the other boys and girls of America,\r\nthousands upon thousands, keep watch by these arms, keep faith with\r\nhome and country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME AND ITS FESTIVALS\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME, SWEET HOME\r\n\r\nJohn Howard Payne\r\n\r\n    \'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam\r\n    Be it ever so humble, there\'s no place like home!\r\n    A charm from the sky seems to hallow us there,\r\n    Which, seek through the world, is ne\'er met with elsewhere.\r\n    Home, Home, sweet, sweet Home!\r\n    There\'s no place like Home! there\'s no place like Home!\r\n\r\n    An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain;\r\n    Oh! give me my lonely thatched cottage again!\r\n    The birds, singing gayly, that came at my call--\r\n    Give me them--and the peace of mind dearer than all!\r\n    Home, Home, sweet, sweet Home!\r\n    There\'s no place like Home! there\'s no place like Home!\r\n\r\n    How sweet \'tis to sit \'neath a fond father\'s smile,\r\n    And the cares of a mother to soothe and beguile!\r\n    Let others delight mid new pleasures to roam,\r\n    But give me, oh, give me, the pleasures of home!\r\n    Home, Home, sweet, sweet Home!\r\n    There\'s no place like Home! there\'s no place like Home!\r\n\r\n    To thee I\'ll return, overburdened with care;\r\n    The heart\'s dearest solace will smile on me there;\r\n    No more from that cottage again will I roam;\r\n    Be it ever so humble, there\'s no place like home.\r\n    Home, Home, sweet, sweet Home!\r\n    There\'s no place like Home! there\'s no place like Home!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nBiography.

"The First Thanksgiving Day" gives a good picture of the\r\nlife in the old Pilgrim days.\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrims landed at Plymouth December 21, 1620. During the long,\r\nhard winter fifty-one of the one hundred Pilgrims died, among them\r\nbeing Rose Standish, wife of Captain Miles Standish. As soon as spring\r\ncame, the colonists planted their fields, and by the end of summer a\r\nplentiful harvest was gathered in. When provisions and fuel had\r\nbeen laid in for the winter, Governor Bradford appointed a day of\r\nthanksgiving. Venison, wild fowl, and fish were easy to obtain. We\r\nare told, "there was great store of wild turkeys, of which they took\r\nmany."

NICHOLAS\r\n\r\nCLEMENT C. MOORE\r\n\r\n    \'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house\r\n    Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.\r\n    The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,\r\n    In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there\r\n    The children were nestled all snug in their beds,\r\n    While visions of sugarplums danced through their heads;\r\n    And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,\r\n    Had just settled our brains for a long winter\'s nap--\r\n\r\n    When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,\r\n    I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.\r\n    Away to the window I flew like a flash,\r\n    Tore open the shutters, and threw up the sash;\r\n    The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow\r\n    Gave a luster of midday to objects below;\r\n    When what to my wondering eyes should appear\r\n    But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,\r\n    With a little old driver, so lively and quick,\r\n    I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.\r\n    More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,\r\n    And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:\r\n    "Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!\r\n    On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!--\r\n    To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall,\r\n    Now, dash away, dash away, dash away, all!"\r\n    As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,\r\n    When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,\r\n    So, up to the housetop the coursers they flew,\r\n    With a sleigh full of toys--and St. Nicholas, too.\r\n    And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof\r\n    The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.\r\n    As I drew in my head, and was turning around,\r\n    Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound;\r\n    He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,\r\n    And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.\r\n    A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,\r\n    And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.\r\n    His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!\r\n    His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;\r\n    His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,\r\n    And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.\r\n    The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,\r\n    And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.\r\n    He had a broad face, and a little round belly\r\n    That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.\r\n    He was chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf;\r\n    And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.\r\n    A wink of his eye and a twist of his head\r\n    Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.\r\n    He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,\r\n    And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,\r\n    And laying his finger aside of his nose,\r\n    And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.\r\n    He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,\r\n    And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.\r\n    But I heard him exclaim, ere they drove out of sight,\r\n    "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night."\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nBiography.

If he be\r\nin a foreign land, the flag is companionship and country itself, with\r\nall its endearments. Its highest beauty is in what it symbolizes. It\r\nis because it represents all, that all gaze at it with delight and\r\nreverence.\r\n\r\nIt is a piece of bunting lifted in the air; but it speaks sublimely,\r\nand every part has a voice. Its stripes of alternate red and white\r\nproclaim the original union of thirteen states to maintain the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. Its stars of white on a field of blue\r\nproclaim that union of states constituting our national constellation,\r\nwhich receives a new star with every new state. The two together\r\nsignify union past and present.\r\n\r\nThe very colors have a language which was officially recognized by our\r\nfathers. White is for purity, red for valor, blue for justice; and all\r\ntogether, bunting, stripes, stars, and colors, blazing in the sky,\r\nmake the flag of our country to be cherished by all our hearts, to be\r\nupheld by all our hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nBiography.

His patriotic poem, "The\r\nStar-Spangled Banner," which has become a national song, made him\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nThe incidents referred to in this poem occurred during the War of\r\n1812. In August, 1814, a strong force of British entered Washington\r\nand burned the Capitol, the White House, and many other public\r\nbuildings. On September 13, the British admiral moved his fleet into\r\nposition to attack Fort McHenry, near Baltimore. The bombardment of\r\nthe fort lasted all night, but the fort was so bravely defended that\r\nthe flag was still floating over it when morning came.\r\n\r\nJust before the bombardment began, Francis Scott Key was sent to the\r\nadmiral\'s frigate to arrange for an exchange of prisoners, and was\r\ntold to wait until the bombardment was over. All night he watched\r\nthe fort, and by the first rays of morning light he saw he Stars\r\nand Stripes still waving.

BROOKS\r\n\r\nThe future president of the United States was eight years old when\r\nhe spent the winter with his father, mother, and sister in the\r\n"half-faced camp" on Little Pigeon Creek. It was indeed rough living\r\nin the Lincoln home on Little Pigeon Creek. When he was "good and\r\nready," the father, Thomas Lincoln, set about building a better\r\nshelter for his family than the forlorn "half-faced camp." The new\r\nbuilding was not such a great improvement, but it was more like a\r\nhouse. It was a rough cabin of logs, without door, window, or floor.\r\nBut it seemed so much better than the shanty in which they had been\r\nliving that Abraham felt quite princely.\r\n\r\nHis life was lonely enough in that wilderness; but, before many\r\nmonths, he had company. His Uncle and Aunt Sparrow and his boy\r\ncousin, Dennis Hanks came from Kentucky to try their luck in Indiana.\r\nAbraham\'s father gave them the old "half-faced camp" as a home, and so\r\nthe Lincolns had near neighbors.\r\n\r\nBut before the winter set in, there came sad days to both houses. A\r\nterrible sickness--what we call an epidemic--visited that section of\r\nIndiana. Many people died from it, and among these were first, Uncle\r\nand Aunt Sparrow, and then Mrs. Lincoln, the mother of Abraham.\r\n\r\nIt was a poor kind of housekeeping they had in that shiftless home on\r\nLittle Pigeon Creek after the mother of the home had been taken away.\r\nSarah, the eldest child, was only twelve; Abraham was but ten, and\r\nlittle Dennis Hanks was eight. Sarah tried to keep house; and her\r\nfather, in his careless way, tried to help her. But about all they\r\ncould do was to keep from going hungry. Deer-meat broiled on the coals\r\nof the wood-fire, ash-cakes made of cornmeal, with now and then a slab\r\nof pork, was their only bill of fare. About all the pleasure Abraham\r\nfound when he was not trying to keep from being cold and hungry, was\r\nin his books.\r\n\r\nHow many do you think he had? Just three: the Bible, Aesop\'s Fables,\r\nand The Pilgrim\'s Progress. Think of that, you boys and girls who have\r\nmore books than you can read, and for whom the printing presses are\r\nalways hard at work. The boy knew these three books almost by heart.\r\nHe could repeat whole chapters of the Bible, many parts of The\r\nPilgrim\'s Progress, and every one of Aesop\'s Fables; and he never\r\nforgot them.\r\n\r\nThomas Lincoln knew that the uncomfortable state of affairs in his log\r\ncabin could not long continue, or his home, such as it was, would go\r\nto ruin. So one day he bade the children good-by and told them he was\r\ngoing back to Kentucky on a visit. He was away for three weeks; but\r\nwhen he returned from his Kentucky visit in December, 1819, he\r\nbrought back a new wife to look after his home and be a mother to his\r\nmotherless children.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln seemed to take an especial liking to the little\r\nten-year-old Abraham. She saw something in the boy that made her feel\r\nsure that a little guidance would do wonders for him. Having first\r\nmade him clean and comfortable, she next made him intelligent, bright,\r\nand good. She managed to send him to school for a few months. The\r\nlittle log schoolhouse, close to the meeting-house, to which the\r\ntraveling schoolmaster would come to give four weeks\' schooling, was\r\nscarcely high enough for a man to stand straight in; it had holes for\r\nwindows and greased paper to take the place of glass. But in such a\r\nplace Abraham Lincoln "got his schooling" for a few weeks only in\r\n"reading, writing, and ciphering"; here he was again and again head of\r\nhis class; and here he "spelled down" all the big boys and girls in\r\nthe exciting contests called "spelling matches."\r\n\r\nHe became a great reader. He read every book and newspaper he could\r\nget hold of, and if he came across anything in his reading that he\r\nwished to remember, he would copy it on a shingle, because writing\r\npaper was scarce, and either learn it by heart or hide the shingle\r\naway until he could get some paper to copy it on.\r\n\r\nLamps and candles were almost unknown in his home, and Abraham, flat\r\non his stomach, would often do his reading, writing, and ciphering in\r\nthe firelight, as it flashed and flickered on the big hearth of his\r\nlog-cabin home.\r\n\r\nOne day Abraham found that a man for whom he sometimes worked owned a\r\ncopy of Weems\'s Life of Washington. This was a famous book in its day.\r\nAbraham borrowed it at once. When he was not reading it, he put it\r\naway on a shelf--a clapboard resting on wooden pins. There was a big\r\ncrack between the log behind the shelf, and one rainy day the Life of\r\nWashington fell into the crack and was soaked almost into pulp. Young\r\nAbraham went at once to the owner of the book and, after telling him\r\nof the accident promised to "work the book out."\r\n\r\nThe old farmer kept him so strictly to his promise that he made him\r\n"pull fodder" for the cattle three days as payment for the book. And\r\nthat is the way that Abraham Lincoln bought his first book. For he\r\ndried the Life of Washington and put it in his "library." What boy or\r\ngirl of today would like to buy books at such a price?\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography. Elbridge S. Brooks (1846-1902) was a native of\r\nMassachusetts.

BROOKS\r\n\r\nThe King of England and his advisers determined to make a stand in\r\nAmerica against the French. So they sent over two regiments of British\r\ntroops under command of a brave soldier whose name was Braddock, and\r\ntold him to get what help he could in Virginia and drive out the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nGeneral Braddock came to Virginia with his splendid-looking fighting\r\nmen. When he had studied the situation there, one of the first things\r\nhe did was to ask Colonel George Washington of Mount Vernon to come\r\nwith him as one of his chief assistants. Washington at once accepted.\r\nHe saw that now the King of England "meant business," and that if\r\nGeneral Braddock were as wise as he was brave, the trouble in the Ohio\r\ncountry might be speedily ended and the French driven out.\r\n\r\nBut when he had joined General Braddock, he discovered that that brave\r\nbut obstinate leader thought that battles were to be fought in America\r\njust the same as in Europe, and that soldiers could be marched against\r\nsuch forest-fighters as the French and Indians as if they were going\r\non a parade. Washington did all he could to advise caution. It was of\r\nno use, however. General Braddock said that he was a soldier and knew\r\nhow to fight, and that he did not wish for any advice from these\r\nAmericans who had never seen a real battle.\r\n\r\nAt last everything was ready, and in July, 1755, the army, led by\r\nGeneral Braddock, marched off to attack Fort Duquesne, which the\r\nFrench had built at Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nWashington had worked so hard to get things ready that he was sick in\r\nbed with fever when the soldiers started; but, without waiting to get\r\nwell, he hurried after them and caught up with them on the ninth of\r\nJuly, at a ford on the Monongahela, fifteen miles from Fort Duquesne.\r\n\r\nThe British troops, in full uniform, and in regular order as if they\r\nwere to drill before the King, marched straight on in splendid array.\r\nWashington thought it the most beautiful show he had ever seen; but\r\nhe said to the general: "Do not let the soldiers march into the woods\r\nlike that. The Frenchmen and the Indians may even now be hiding behind\r\nthe trees ready to shoot us down. Let me send some men ahead to\r\nsee where they are, and let some of our Virginians who are used to\r\nfighting in the forest go before to clear them away." But General\r\nBraddock told him to mind his own business, and marched on as\r\ngallantly as ever.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, just as they reached a narrow part of the road, where the\r\nwoods were all about them, the Frenchmen and Indians who were waiting\r\nfor them behind the great trees and underbrush opened fire upon the\r\nBritish troops, and there came just such a dreadful time as Washington\r\nhad feared. But even now Braddock would not give in. His soldiers\r\nmust fight as they had been drilled to fight in Europe; and when\r\nthe Virginians who were with him tried to fight as they had been\r\naccustomed to, he called them cowards and ordered them to form in\r\nline.\r\n\r\nIt was all over very soon. The British soldiers, fired upon from\r\nall sides and scarcely able to see where their enemies were, became\r\nfrightened, huddled together, and made all the better marks for the\r\nbullets of the French and Indians hiding among the trees and bushes.\r\nThen General Braddock fell from his horse, mortally wounded; his\r\nsplendidly-drilled redcoats broke into panic, turned, and ran away;\r\nand only the coolness of Washington and the Virginia forest-fighters\r\nwho were with him saved the entire army from being cut to pieces.\r\n\r\nWashington fought like a hero. Two horses that he rode were killed\r\nwhile he kept in the saddle; his coat was shot through and through,\r\nand it seemed as if he would be killed any moment. But he kept on\r\nfighting, caring nothing for danger. He tried to turn back the fleeing\r\nBritish troops; he tried to bring back the cannon, and, when the\r\ngunners ran away, he leaped from his horse and aimed and fired the\r\ncannon himself. Then with his Virginians, that Braddock had so\r\ndespised as soldiers, he protected the rear of the retreating army,\r\ncarried off the dying general and, cool and collected in the midst of\r\nall the terrible things that were happening, saved the British army\r\nfrom slaughter, buried poor General Braddock in the Virginia woods,\r\nand finally brought back to the settlements what was left of that\r\nsplendid army of the King. He was the only man in all that time of\r\ndisaster who came out of the fight with glory and renown.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

I want you to go,\r\n    While there is light to see,\r\n    To the hut of the blind old man who lives\r\n    Across the dike, for me;\r\n    And take these cakes I made for him--\r\n    They are hot and smoking yet;\r\n    You have time enough to go and come\r\n    Before the sun is set."\r\n\r\n    And Peter left the brother\r\n    With whom all day he had played,\r\n    And the sister who had watched their sports\r\n    In the willow\'s tender shade;\r\n    And told them they\'d see him back before\r\n    They saw a star in sight,\r\n    Though he wouldn\'t be afraid to go\r\n    In the very darkest night!\r\n    For he was a brave, bright fellow\r\n    With eye and conscience clear;\r\n    He could do whatever a boy might do,\r\n    And he had not learned to fear.\r\n\r\n    And now with his face all glowing\r\n    And eyes as bright as the day\r\n    With the thoughts of his pleasant errand,\r\n    He trudged along the way;\r\n    And soon his joyous prattle\r\n    Made glad a lonesome place--\r\n    Alas! if only the blind old man\r\n    Could have seen that happy face!\r\n    Yet he somehow caught the brightness\r\n    Which his voice and presence lent;\r\n    And he felt the sunshine come and go\r\n    As Peter came and went.\r\n\r\n    And now as the day was sinking,\r\n    And the winds began to rise,\r\n    The mother looked from her door again,\r\n    Shading her anxious eyes,\r\n    And saw the shadows deepen\r\n    And birds to their homes come back,\r\n    But never a sign of Peter\r\n    Along the level track.\r\n    But she said: "He will come at morning,\r\n    So I need not fret or grieve--\r\n    Though it isn\'t like my boy at all\r\n    To stay without my leave."\r\n\r\n    But where was the child delaying?\r\n    On the homeward way was he;\r\n    And across the dike while the sun was up\r\n    An hour above the sea;\r\n    He was stopping now to gather flowers,\r\n    Now listening to the sound,\r\n    As the angry waters dashed themselves\r\n    Against their narrow bound.\r\n    "Ah! well for us," said Peter,\r\n    "That the gates are good and strong,\r\n    And my father tends them carefully,\r\n    Or they would not hold you long!\r\n    You\'re a wicked sea," said Peter;\r\n    "I know why you fret and chafe;\r\n    You would like to spoil our land and homes;\r\n    But our sluices keep you safe."\r\n\r\n    But hark! through the noise of waters\r\n    Comes a low, clear, trickling sound;\r\n    And the child\'s face pales with terror,\r\n    And his blossoms drop to the ground.\r\n    He is up the bank in a moment\r\n    And, stealing through the sand\r\n    He sees a stream not yet so large\r\n    As his slender childish hand.\r\n    \'Tis a leak in the dike!  He is but a boy,\r\n    Unused to fearful scenes;\r\n    But, young as he is, he has learned to know\r\n    The dreadful thing that means.\r\n\r\n    A leak in the dike!  The stoutest heart\r\n    Grows faint that cry to hear.\r\n    And the bravest man in all the land\r\n    Turns white with mortal fear,\r\n    For he knows the smallest leak may grow\r\n    To a flood in a single night;\r\n    And he knows the strength of the cruel sea\r\n    When loosed in its angry might.\r\n\r\n    And the boy! he has seen the danger\r\n    And, shouting a wild alarm,\r\n    He forces back the weight of the sea\r\n    With the strength of his single arm!\r\n    He listens for the joyful sound\r\n    Of a footstep passing nigh;\r\n    And lays his ear to the ground, to catch\r\n    The answer to his cry.\r\n    And he hears the rough winds blowing,\r\n    And the waters rise and fall,\r\n    But never an answer comes to him\r\n    Save the echo of his call.\r\n\r\n    So, faintly calling and crying\r\n    Till the sun is under the sea,\r\n    Crying and moaning till the stars\r\n    Come out for company,\r\n    He thinks of his brother and sister,\r\n    Asleep in their safe warm bed;\r\n    He thinks of his father and mother,\r\n    Of himself as dying--and dead;\r\n    And of how, when the night is over,\r\n    They must come and find him at last;\r\n    But he never thinks he can leave the place\r\n    Where duty holds him fast.\r\n\r\n    The good dame in the cottage\r\n    Is up and astir with the light,\r\n    For the thought of her little Peter\r\n    Has been with her all the night.\r\n    And now she watches the pathway,\r\n    As yester eve she had done;\r\n    But what does she see so strange and black\r\n    Against the rising sun?\r\n    Her neighbors are bearing between them\r\n    Something straight to her door;\r\n    Her child is coming home, but not\r\n    As he ever came before!\r\n\r\n    "He is dead!" she cries; "thy darling!"\r\n    And the startled father hears,\r\n    And comes and looks the way she looks,\r\n    And fears the thing she fears;\r\n    Till a glad shout from the bearers\r\n    Thrills the stricken man and wife--\r\n    "Give thanks, for your son has saved our land,\r\n    And God has saved his life!"\r\n    So, there in the morning sunshine\r\n    They knelt about the boy;\r\n    And every head was bared and bent\r\n    In tearful, reverent joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nBiography.

A mile away to\r\nthe west stood a low stone house, and immediately in front of us\r\nopened a half-section of unfenced sod. To the north, as far as I could\r\nsee, the land billowed like a russet ocean, with scarcely a roof to\r\nfleck its lonely spread. I cannot say that I liked or disliked it. I\r\nmerely marveled at it; and while I wandered about the yard, the hired\r\nman scorched some cornmeal mush in a skillet, and this, with some\r\nbutter and gingerbread, made up my first breakfast in Mitchell County.\r\n\r\nFor a few days my brother and I had little to do other than to\r\nkeep the cattle from straying, and we used our leisure in becoming\r\nacquainted with the region round about.\r\n\r\nTo the south the sections were nearly all settled upon, for in that\r\ndirection lay the county town; but to the north and on into Minnesota\r\nrolled the unplowed sod, the feeding ground of the cattle, the home of\r\nfoxes and wolves, and to the west, just beyond the highest ridges, we\r\nloved to think the bison might still be seen.\r\n\r\nThe cabin on this rented farm was a mere shanty, a shell of pine\r\nboards, which needed reinforcing to make it habitable, and one day my\r\nfather said, "Well, Hamlin, I guess you\'ll have to run the plow-team\r\nthis fall. I must help neighbor Button reinforce the house, and I\r\ncan\'t afford to hire another man."\r\n\r\nThis seemed a fine commission for a lad of ten, and I drove my horses\r\ninto the field that first morning with a manly pride which added\r\nan inch to my stature. I took my initial "round" at a "land" which\r\nstretched from one side of the quarter section to the other, in\r\nconfident mood. I was grown up!\r\n\r\nBut alas! My sense of elation did not last long. To guide a team for\r\na few minutes as an experiment was one thing--to plow all day like a\r\nhired hand was another. It was not a chore; it was a job. It meant\r\nmoving to and fro hour after hour, day after day, with no one to\r\ntalk to but the horses. It meant trudging eight or nine miles in the\r\nforenoon and as many more in the afternoon, with less than an hour off\r\nat noon. It meant dragging the heavy implement around the corners, and\r\nit meant also many shipwrecks; for the thick, wet stubble often threw\r\nthe share completely out of the ground, making it necessary for me to\r\nhalt the team and jerk the heavy plow backward for a new start.\r\n\r\nAlthough strong and active, I was rather short, even for a\r\nten-year-old, and to reach the plow handles I was obliged to lift my\r\nhands above my shoulders; and so with the guiding lines crossed over\r\nmy back and my worn straw hat bobbing just above the cross-brace I\r\nmust have made a comical figure. At any rate nothing like it had been\r\nseen in the neighborhood; and the people on the road to town, looking\r\nacross the field, laughed and called to me, and neighbor Button said\r\nto my father in my hearing, "That chap\'s too young to run a plow," a\r\njudgment which pleased and flattered me greatly.\r\n\r\nHarriet cheered me by running out occasionally to meet me as I turned\r\nthe nearest corner, and sometimes Frank consented to go all the way\r\naround, chatting breathlessly as he trotted along behind. At other\r\ntimes he brought me a cookie and a glass of milk, a deed which helped\r\nto shorten the forenoon. And yet plowing became tedious.\r\n\r\nThe flies were savage, especially in the middle of the day, and the\r\nhorses, tortured by their lances, drove badly, twisting and turning in\r\ntheir rage. Their tails were continually getting over the lines,\r\nand in stopping to kick their tormentors they often got astride the\r\ntraces, and in other ways made trouble for me. Only in the early\r\nmorning or when the sun sank low at night were they able to move\r\nquietly along their way.\r\n\r\nThe soil was the kind my father had been seeking, a smooth, dark,\r\nsandy loam, which made it possible for a lad to do the work of a man.\r\nOften the share would go the entire "round" without striking a root or\r\na pebble as big as a walnut, the steel running steadily with a crisp,\r\ncrunching, ripping sound which I rather liked to hear. In truth, the\r\nwork would have been quite tolerable had it not been so long drawn\r\nout. Ten hours of it, even on a fine day, made about twice too many\r\nfor a boy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I cheered myself in every imaginable way. I whistled. I\r\nsang. I studied the clouds. I gnawed the beautiful red skin from the\r\nseed vessels which hung upon the wild rose bushes, and I counted the\r\nprairie chickens as they began to come together in winter flocks,\r\nrunning through the stubble in search of food. I stopped now and again\r\nto examine the lizards unhoused by the share, and I measured the\r\nlittle granaries of wheat which the mice and gophers had deposited\r\ndeep under the ground, storehouses which the plow had violated. My\r\neyes dwelt enviously upon the sailing hawk and on the passing of\r\nducks. The occasional shadowy figure of a prairie wolf made me wish\r\nfor Uncle David and his rifle.\r\n\r\nOn certain days nothing could cheer me. When the bitter wind blew from\r\nthe north, and the sky was filled with wild geese racing southward\r\nwith swiftly-hurrying clouds, winter seemed about to spring upon me.\r\nThe horses\' tails streamed in the wind. Flurries of snow covered me\r\nwith clinging flakes, and the mud "gummed" my boots and trouser\r\nlegs, clogging my steps. At such times I suffered from cold and\r\nloneliness--all sense of being a man evaporated. I was just a little\r\nboy, longing for the leisure of boyhood.\r\n\r\nDay after day, through the month of October and deep into November,\r\nI followed that team, turning over two acres of stubble each day. I\r\nwould not believe this without proof, but it is true! At last it grew\r\nso cold that in the early morning everything was white with frost,\r\nand I was obliged to put one hand in my pocket to keep it warm, while\r\nholding the plow with the other; but I didn\'t mind this so much, for\r\nit hinted at the close of autumn. I\'ve no doubt facing the wind in\r\nthis way was excellent discipline, but I didn\'t think it necessary\r\nthen, and my heart was sometimes bitter and rebellious.\r\n\r\nMy father did not intend to be severe. As he had always been an\r\nearly riser and a busy toiler, it seemed perfectly natural and good\r\ndiscipline that his sons should also plow and husk corn at ten years\r\nof age. He often told of beginning life as a "bound boy" at nine, and\r\nthese stories helped me to perform my own tasks without whining.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a morning when by striking my heel upon the ground\r\nI convinced my boss that the soil was frozen. "All right," he said;\r\n"you may lay off this forenoon."\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nBiography. Hamlin Garland (1860-1940) was born in Wisconsin. His\r\nfather was a farmer-pioneer, who was always eager to be on the border\r\nline of the farming country; consequently, he moved from Wisconsin to\r\nMinnesota, from Minnesota to Iowa, and from Iowa to Dakota. The hope\r\nof cheaper land, better soil, and bigger crops led him on. When Hamlin\r\nGarland turned his attention to literature, he decided to write\r\ntruthfully of the western farmer\'s life and its great hardships in\r\npioneer days, as well as its hopes and joys. In A Son of the Middle\r\nBorder, an autobiography, from which "My Boyhood on the Prairie" is\r\ntaken, he has given a most interesting record of experiences in the\r\ndevelopment of the Middle West. Mitchell County, where this scene is\r\nlaid, is in Iowa.\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1. Describe the boy\'s new home. 2. What work did the boy\r\nhave to do? 3. In what spirit did he start the plowing? 4.

Now the chances are strong that he\r\nwon\'t be much of a man unless he is a good deal of a boy. He must not\r\nbe a coward or a weakling, a bully, a shirk, or a prig. He must work\r\nhard and play hard. He must be clean-minded and clean lived, and able\r\nto hold his own against all comers. It is only on these conditions\r\nthat he will grow into the kind of American man of whom America can be\r\nreally proud.\r\n\r\nNo boy can afford to neglect his work, and, with a boy, work as a\r\nrule means study. A boy should work, and should work hard, at his\r\nlessons--in the first place, for the sake of what he will learn, and\r\nin the next place, for the sake of the effect upon his own character\r\nof resolutely settling down to learn it. Shiftlessness, slackness,\r\nindifference in studying are almost certain to mean inability to get\r\non in other walks of life. I do not believe in mischief-doing in\r\nschool hours, or in the kind of animal spirits that results in making\r\nbad scholars; and I believe that those boys who take part in rough,\r\nhard play outside of school will not find any need for horseplay in\r\nschool. While they study they should study just as hard as they play\r\nfootball. It is wise to obey the homely old adage, "Work while you\r\nwork; play while you play."\r\n\r\nA boy needs both physical and moral courage. Neither can take the\r\nplace of the other. A coward who will take a blow without returning\r\nit is a contemptible creature; but, after all, he is hardly as\r\ncontemptible as the boy who dares not stand up for what he deems right\r\nagainst the sneers of his companions who are themselves wrong. There\r\nis no need to be a prig. There is no need for a boy to preach\r\nabout his own conduct and virtue. If he does, he will make himself\r\nridiculous. But there is need that he should practice decency; that he\r\nshould be clean and straight, honest and truthful, gentle and tender,\r\nas well as brave.\r\n\r\nThe boy can best become a good man by being a good boy--not a\r\ngoody-goody boy, but just a plain good boy. "Good," in the largest\r\nsense, should include whatever is fine, straightforward, clean, brave,\r\nand manly. The best boys I know--the best men I know--are good at\r\ntheir studies or their business, fearless and stalwart, hated and\r\nfeared by all that is wicked, incapable of submitting to wrong-doing,\r\nand equally incapable of being aught but tender to the weak and\r\nhelpless. A healthy-minded boy should feel hearty contempt for the\r\ncoward, and even more hearty indignation for the boy who bullies girls\r\nor small boys, or tortures animals.\r\n\r\nOf course the effect that a thoroughly manly, thoroughly straight and\r\nupright boy can have upon the companions of his own age, and upon\r\nthose who are younger, is incalculable. He cannot do good work if he\r\nis not strong and does not try with his whole heart and soul to count\r\nin any contest; and his strength will be a curse to himself and to\r\neveryone else if he does not have thorough command over himself and\r\nover his own evil passions, and if he does not use his strength on the\r\nside of decency, justice, and fair dealing.\r\n\r\nIn short, in life, as in a football game, the principle to follow is:\r\nHit the line hard; don\'t foul and don\'t shirk, but hit the line hard!\r\n--Abridged.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nFor Biography, see page 37.

The poems about home might be called\r\nmemory-pictures of home; why do you think older people remember with\r\nso much fondness their childhood homes? Imagine yourself telling\r\nyour grandchildren about the home of your youth and about your home\r\npleasures; what things would you mention? Why is it a good thing for a\r\nnation to have its people love their homes and the festival days like\r\nChristmas and Thanksgiving?\r\n\r\nAnd now a turn of the Crystal Glass reveals a glorious flag, floating\r\nprotectingly over us. How you love to look upon its starry folds; when\r\nstatesmen and poets tell you of the meaning of Old Glory you realize\r\nthat there is good reason for your pride and your love. What did\r\nCharles Sumner tell you about the meaning of the stars and the stripes\r\nand the colors of the Flag? What did James Whitcomb Riley tell you\r\nabout how Old Glow got its name? What were the circumstances under\r\nwhich Francis Scott Key wrote "The Star-Spangled Banner"? What are\r\nsome of the things you can do to show your respect for the Flag? What\r\nare some of the things you remember about Lincoln\'s boyhood? How\r\ndoes his method of memorizing com-pare with yours? The young George\r\nWashington showed remarkable bravery as Braddock\'s chief assistant;\r\nwhat other fine quality did he show? How may these stories about\r\nWashington and Lincoln help you to be a worthy citizen of the country\r\nthey helped to found and preserve?\r\n\r\nWe admire all people who are helpful to others, but when in giving\r\nservice, some forget about themselves and even sacrifice themselves\r\nfor others, we regard these as heroes. Peter, in "The Leak in the\r\nDike," and the boy in "Somebody\'s Mother" forgot about themselves in\r\ntheir service to others; one disregarded danger to himself, and\r\nthe other the possible jeers of his playmates; do you know of any\r\ninstances of service in your school? It is fine to serve obediently\r\nunder the command of superiors as did the young Casabianca, but it is\r\neven finer to think quickly in an emergency and to do what should be\r\ndone when there is no one at hand to give orders. Who gave Peter his\r\norders? Tubal Cain belongs to a group of men who have served their\r\nfellow men by useful inventions; mention some other inventors and tell\r\nhow they have helped mankind. Hamlin Garland gave you a glimpse of\r\nthe pioneer\'s service to our country; what names of pioneers in your\r\nlocality are honored for their service in the early days? What ideas\r\nof being useful home-members did you get from Hamlin Garland and\r\nTheodore Roosevelt? How does the habit of being useful in the home\r\nfit one for being a good citizen? American boys and girls have many\r\nopportunities for service in the home, in the school, and in their\r\nother relations; have you done any piece of service, in an organized\r\nway, in your school? Does your school belong to the Junior Red Cross,\r\nand does it try\' to follow the motto, "Go forth to serve"?\r\n\r\nWhen you look back upon all that you have read of home and country,\r\nyou no doubt come to the conclusion that "the man without a country"\r\nsummed it all up when he said, "Stick to your family...

Trees are for Ali Baba\r\nto hide in; beefsteaks are to throw down into the Valley of Diamonds\r\nthat the precious stones may stick to them and be carried by the\r\neagles to their nests, whence the traders, with loud cries, will scare\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCHARLES DICKENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORIES OF ADVENTURE\r\n\r\nA FORWARD LOOK\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen something out of the ordinary happens to you, you call it an\r\nadventure. Perhaps you came very near getting drowned in the swimming\r\npool, or you found a purse with some money and some queer treasures in\r\nit, or you met a very curious old man, or you caught a rabbit after an\r\nexciting chase, or you went on a long journey and saw many wonderful\r\nthings. If you have had such an experience, you like to tell about it\r\nto your friends, and if you have not, you like to hear the stories\r\ntold by people who have had some thrilling adventure of their own.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times to the present the man who has had some\r\nunusual experience to tell about has been a favorite. We are eager to\r\nhear such stories; they make life seem more interesting and varied.\r\nNowadays we read such stories in books and magazines; we are not\r\ndependent upon hearing them from the lips of those who have lived\r\nlives of adventure. But centuries ago, before there were books and\r\nnewspapers, when any journey away from home, even for a few miles, was\r\nfilled with peril, the traveler who could tell of marvelous things, or\r\nthe weaver of tales who had a vivid imagination so that he could tell\r\nabout things that seemed really true, found eager hearers. Among the\r\nFrench, stories about Roland, the wonderful knight who fought in the\r\nwars of the Emperor Charlemagne, were known by every boy and girl. The\r\nEnglish had King Arthur, and Saint George, and Robin Hood.\r\n\r\nBesides these legends about a national hero, there are many\r\ncollections of stories that have grown up among the common people.\r\nOne of the oldest of these collections of tales is that known as the\r\nArabian Nights. For hundreds of years these stories were told in the\r\ntents of the desert or in the gay bazaars of the cities of the East.\r\nAbout the time of the discovery of America they were written down and\r\nbecame known as the Arabian Nights Entertainment, or the tales of a\r\nthousand and one nights. We are told that there was once a cruel King\r\nwho planned to slay all the women in his kingdom. His wife determined\r\nto tell him such wonderful stories that he would give up his cruel\r\npurpose. So she told him of enchanted gardens, of caves filled with\r\ntreasure, of palaces built in a night, and of many other things. He\r\nwas so eager to hear these stories that a thousand and one nights\r\npassed before he could escape from the spell that she laid upon him.\r\nBy this time he was so much in love with her that he withdrew his\r\nwicked order. You may see how marvelous were these tales by reading\r\nthe stories of Aladdin, of Ali Baba, and of Sindbad the Sailor.\r\nPerhaps when you have finished them you will not wonder that the King\r\nfound the thousand and one nights so happy that he lost his desire to\r\ncarry out his cruel purpose.\r\n\r\nNext, you are introduced to one of the most popular of English heroes,\r\nRobin Hood. Many old ballads and tales, older than the first American\r\ncolony, have come down to us with these stories of the famous outlaw.\r\nThe stories are very different from those of the Arabian Nights. They\r\nhave no treasure caves or magic lamps or voyages to strange countries\r\nin them. They tell of contests in archery, for which the English were\r\nfamous; of wrestling and swimming matches; of outlaws and dwellers in\r\nthe greenwood. Because he was their champion against unjust taxation\r\nand oppressive laws, Robin Hood was the idol of the common people.\r\nThey made up games about him, in which old and young took part.\r\nWandering minstrels sang about him. "Lincoln green," the color of the\r\nclothing worn by Robin and his followers, was a favorite with all\r\nforesters. Why Robin was so loved you may determine for yourselves by\r\nreading the stories of Robin Hood given in the pages that follow.\r\n\r\nIn Gulliver\'s Travels we pass from stories like the Arabian Nights\r\nand "Robin Hood," which grew up among the common people, to a story\r\ncomposed by a single author who wrote out his material and then had it\r\nprinted in order that all might enjoy it. We do not know who wrote the\r\nstory of Ali Baba or the adventures of Robin Hood, but we know all\r\nabout Jonathan Swift, the great English writer who tells us the story\r\nof Gulliver\'s adventures among the little people, or Lilliputians.\r\nGulliver also had wonderful experiences among a race of giants, and in\r\na land where the citizens were horses that were more intelligent than\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nSomewhat different from all the other tales in this part of our book\r\nis the story of Robinson Crusoe, written by Daniel Defoe about two\r\nhundred years ago and here condensed for your enjoyment. There was, in\r\nDefoe\'s time, a sailor, Alexander Selkirk by name, who was left by his\r\nshipmates on an island and who lived by himself for four years before\r\nhe attracted the attention of a passing ship. This suggested the idea\r\nof Robinson Crusoe to Defoe, but he has greatly expanded the story.\r\nCrusoe lived on his lonely island for twenty-seven years. During this\r\ntime he learned how to make tools, to build his house, to cultivate\r\nhis farm, to prepare to defend himself against an enemy\'s attack, and\r\nto civilize barbarous people.\r\n\r\nIn its original form each of the stories in this group makes a\r\ngood-sized book. While some incidents and many details have been\r\nomitted here in order to shorten and simplify the stories, the main\r\nplot and all the most interesting incidents are given.\r\n\r\nThe world is full of stories of adventure; these are only samples of\r\nthe joyful experiences that you may have through your power to read.\r\nAnd you boys and girls are more fortunate than those who lived in the\r\ntime of Aladdin, or even those who lived in the time of Robin Hood or\r\nRobinson Crusoe, for they had no books at all, or only a few, and\r\nif they had any, these books were poorly printed, with very ugly\r\nillustrations, not at all like the wonderful books that you may have\r\nat will.\r\n\r\nBut of all the stories that might have been selected, the ones placed\r\nbefore you have been chosen for two reasons. First of all, they are\r\ninteresting, and are to be read for pure enjoyment. And next, these\r\nstories leave with you certain ideas that are well worth while.\r\nAladdin and Ali Baba, the heroes of the Arabian Nights stories, who\r\nbecame rich through their strange adventures, helped their neighbors\r\nwith their wealth. Robin Hood, too, helped the poor oppressed people\r\nof his time, though he did many things that would be wrong today.\r\nRobinson Crusoe\'s lonely life on a desert island shows us how much we\r\ndepend upon the work of those about us. And Captain Gulliver, in the\r\nmidst of his wonderful adventures, always kept in mind the ideas of\r\njustice and honor.\r\n\r\nSo in all these stories there is a sense of justice and\r\nresponsibility. Nowadays--at least in America--men are free. Buried\r\ntreasure is as hard to find as ever, but it can be found. The man who\r\nworks hard, who seizes opportunities, who builds up a business or runs\r\na farm, can find his treasure. The government will protect him; we\r\nno longer need to use the methods of Robin Hood to get justice. The\r\nimportant question is whether the Ali Babas and Aladdins of our day\r\nwill feel just such responsibility to others as you find recorded in\r\nthese stories, and whether the desire to help the unfortunate is as\r\nstrong in our free America as it was in the heart of Robin Hood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORIES FROM THE ARABIAN NIGHTS\r\n\r\nALADDIN, OR THE WONDERFUL LAMP\r\n\r\n(Ed.--This story, in it\'s original, uncondensed version, in addition\r\nto many others, can be found at the web site http://www.gutenberg.org,\r\nsearching in the index for the title Arabian Nights.)\r\n\r\nAladdin was the son of Mustapha, a poor tailor in one of the rich\r\nprovinces of China. When the boy was old enough to learn a trade, his\r\nfather took him into his own workshop. But Aladdin, being but an idle\r\nfellow, loved play more than work, and spent his days playing in the\r\npublic streets with other boys as idle as himself.\r\n\r\nHis father died while he was yet very young; but Aladdin still\r\ncontinued his foolish ways, and his mother was forced to spin cotton\r\nnight and day in order to keep herself and her boy.\r\n\r\nWhen Aladdin was about fifteen years old, he was one day playing in\r\nthe streets with some of his companions. A stranger who was going\r\nby stopped and looked at him. This stranger was a famous African\r\nmagician, who, having need of the help of some ignorant person, no\r\nsooner beheld Aladdin than he knew by his whole manner and appearance\r\nthat he was a person of small prudence and very fit to be made a tool\r\nof. The magician inquired of some persons standing near, the name and\r\ncharacter of Aladdin, and the answers proved to him that he had judged\r\nrightly of the boy. The stranger, pressing in among the crowd of lads,\r\nclapped his hand on Aladdin\'s shoulder, and said, "My good lad, are\r\nyou not the son of Mustapha, the tailor?" "Yes, sir," said Aladdin;\r\n"but my father has been dead this long time."\r\n\r\n"Alas!" cried he, "what unhappy news! I am your father\'s brother,\r\nchild. I have been many years abroad; and now that I have come home\r\nin the hope of seeing him, you tell me he is dead!" And all the while\r\ntears ran down the stranger\'s cheeks, and his bosom heaved with sighs.\r\nThen, pulling out a purse, he gave Aladdin two pieces of gold, saying,\r\n"Take this, my boy, to your mother. Tell her that I will come and see\r\nher tonight, and sup with her." Pleased with the money, Aladdin ran\r\nhome to his mother. "Mother," said he, "have I an uncle?" His mother\r\ntold him he had not, whereupon Aladdin pulled out his gold and told\r\nher that a man who said he was his father\'s brother was coming to sup\r\nwith her that very evening. Full of bewilderment, the good woman\r\nset out for the market, where she bought provisions, and was busy\r\npreparing the supper when the magician knocked at the door. He\r\nentered, followed by a porter who brought all kinds of delicious\r\nfruits and sweetmeats for their dessert.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they sat down to supper, he gave Aladdin\'s mother an\r\naccount of his travels, saying that for forty years he had been away\r\nfrom home, in order to see the wonders of distant countries. Then,\r\nturning toward Aladdin, he asked his name. "I am called Aladdin," said\r\nhe. "Well, Aladdin," said the magician, "what business do you follow?"\r\n\r\nAt this question Aladdin hung down his head, and was not a little\r\nabashed when his mother made answer: "Aladdin is an idle fellow; his\r\nfather strove all he could to teach him his trade, but could not\r\nsucceed; and since his death, in spite of all I can say to him, he\r\ndoes nothing but idle away his time in the streets, so that I despair\r\nof his ever coming to any good." With these words the poor woman burst\r\ninto tears, and the magician, turning to Aladdin, said: "This is not\r\nwell, nephew; you must think of helping yourself and getting your\r\nlivelihood. I will help you as far as I may. What think you--shall\r\nI take a shop and furnish it for you?" Aladdin was overjoyed at the\r\nidea, for he thought there was very little labor in keeping a shop,\r\nand he told his uncle this would suit him better than anything else.\r\n\r\n"I will take you with me tomorrow," said the magician, "clothe you as\r\nhandsomely as the best merchants in the city, and then we will open a\r\nshop."\r\n\r\nAladdin\'s mother thanked him very heartily and begged Aladdin to\r\nbehave so as to prove himself worthy of the good fortune promised by\r\nhis kind uncle.\r\n\r\nNext day the stranger called for Aladdin as he had promised, and led\r\nhim to a merchant\'s, where clothes for all sorts of people were sold.\r\nThen he caused Aladdin to try on the handsomest suits, and choosing\r\nthe one Aladdin preferred he paid the merchant for it at once. The\r\npretended uncle then took Aladdin to visit the bazaars, the khans\r\nwhere the foreign merchants were, and the most splendid mosques, and\r\ngave him a merry feast in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Aladdin got up and dressed himself very early, so\r\nimpatient was he to see his uncle. Presently he saw him coming, and\r\nran to meet him. The magician greeted him very kindly. "Come, my good\r\nboy," he said with a smile; "I will today show you some very fine\r\nthings."\r\n\r\nHe then led him through some beautiful gardens with great houses\r\nstanding in the midst of them. Aladdin did nothing but exclaim at\r\ntheir beauty, and so his uncle by degrees led him on farther and\r\nfarther into the country. "We shall now," said he to Aladdin, "go no\r\nfarther, for I shall here show you some extraordinary wonders that no\r\none besides yourself will ever have seen. I am now going to strike a\r\nlight, and do you, in the meantime, collect all the dry sticks and\r\nleaves that you can find, in order to make a fire."\r\n\r\nThere were so many pieces of dry sticks scattered about this place\r\nthat Aladdin collected more than enough by the time his uncle had\r\nstruck a light. The magician then set them on fire, and as soon as\r\nthey were in a blaze he threw a certain perfume, that he had ready in\r\nhis hand, upon them. A dense smoke arose, while the magician spoke\r\nsome mysterious words. At the same instant the ground shook slightly,\r\nand, opening in the spot where they stood, showed a square stone about\r\na foot and a half across, with a brass ring in the center.\r\n\r\nAladdin was frightened out of his wits, and was about to run away,\r\nwhen the magician suddenly gave him a box on the ear so violent as to\r\nbeat him down and very nearly to knock some of his teeth out. Poor\r\nAladdin, with tears in his eyes and trembling in every limb, got up.\r\n"My dear uncle," he cried, "what have I done to deserve so severe a\r\nblow?" "I have good reasons for it," replied the magician. "Do you but\r\nobey me, and you will not repent of it. Underneath that stone is a\r\ngreat hidden treasure, which will make you richer than many kings if\r\nyou will be attentive to what I shall say to you."\r\n\r\nAladdin had now got the better of his fright. "Well," said he, "what\r\nmust I do? Tell me; I am ready to obey you in everything!" "Well\r\nsaid!" replied the magician; "come to me, then; take hold of this\r\nring, and lift up the stone."\r\n\r\nTo Aladdin\'s surprise the stone was raised without any trouble, and\r\nthen he could see a small opening three or four feet deep, at the\r\nbottom of which was a little door, with steps to go down still lower.\r\n"You must now," said the magician, "go down into this cavern, and when\r\nyou have come to the bottom of the steps, you will see an open door\r\nwhich leads into three great halls. In each of these you will see, on\r\nboth sides of you, four bronze vases as large as tubs, full of gold\r\nand silver, but you must not touch any of it.\r\n\r\n"When you get to the first hall, bind your robe around you. Then go\r\nto the second without stopping, and thence in the same manner to the\r\nthird. Above all, be very particular not to go near the walls or even\r\nto touch them with your robe; for if any part of your dress should\r\nchance to touch them, your instant death will be the consequence. At\r\nthe far end of the third hall there is a door which leads to a garden\r\nplanted with beautiful trees, all of which are full of fruit. Go\r\nstraight forward, and follow a path which you will see. This will\r\nbring you to the bottom of a flight of fifty steps, at the top of\r\nwhich there is a terrace.\r\n\r\n"There you will see a niche and in it a lighted lamp. Take the lamp\r\nand extinguish it. Then throw out the wick and the liquid that is\r\nwithin, and put the lamp in your bosom. If you should wish very much\r\nto gather any of the fruit in the garden, you may do so; and there is\r\nnothing to prevent your taking as much as you please."\r\n\r\nWhen the magician had given these directions to Aladdin, he took off\r\na ring which he had on one of his fingers and put it on his pretended\r\nnephew, telling him at the same time that it was to secure him against\r\nevery evil that might otherwise happen to him. "Go, my child," he\r\nsaid; "descend boldly; we shall now both of us become immensely rich\r\nfor the rest of our lives."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALADDIN FINDS THE WONDERFUL LAMP\r\n\r\nAladdin jumped willingly into the opening and went down to the bottom\r\nof the steps. He found the three halls exactly as the magician had\r\nsaid. These he passed through with the greatest care, keeping in mind\r\nhis uncle\'s warning. He went on to the garden, and mounted to the\r\nterrace without stopping. There in a niche was the lamp, which he\r\nseized, and after he had thrown out the oil which it contained, he put\r\nit in his bosom.\r\n\r\nThis done, he returned to the garden. The trees here were all full of\r\nthe most extraordinary fruit. Never before had he seen fruits of\r\nso many different colors. The white were pearls; the sparkling and\r\ntransparent Were diamonds; the deep red were rubies; the paler, a\r\nparticular sort of ruby called balas; the green, emeralds; the\r\nblue, turquoises; the violet, amethysts; those tinged with yellow,\r\nsapphires. All were of the largest size, and finer than were ever seen\r\nbefore in the whole world. Aladdin was not yet of an age to know their\r\nvalue, and thought they were all only pieces of colored glass.\r\n\r\nHowever, the variety, brilliancy, and extraordinary size of each sort\r\ntempted him to gather some of each; and he took so many of every color\r\nthat he filled both his pockets, as well as the two new purses the\r\nmagician had bought for him at the time he made him a present of his\r\nnew suit. Since his pockets were already full, he fastened the two\r\npurses on each side of his girdle, and also wrapped some of the gems\r\nin its folds, as it was of silk and made very full. In this manner\r\nhe carried his treasures so that they could not fall out. He did not\r\nforget to fill even his bosom quite full, between his robe and his\r\nshirt.\r\n\r\nLaden in this manner with the most immense treasure, though ignorant\r\nof its value, Aladdin made haste through the three halls, in order\r\nthat he might not make his uncle wait too long. Having passed through\r\nthem with the same caution as before, he began to ascend the steps\r\nhe had come down, and reached the entrance of the cave, where the\r\nmagician was impatiently waiting.\r\n\r\nWhen Aladdin saw his uncle, he called to him, "Help me up!" "My dear\r\nboy," replied the magician, "you had better first give me the lamp,\r\nas that will only hinder you." "It is not at all in my way," said\r\nAladdin, "and I will give it to you when I am out." The magician still\r\npersevered in wishing to get the lamp before he helped Aladdin out of\r\nthe cave; but the boy had so covered it with the fruit of the trees\r\nthat he absolutely refused to give it. The wicked magician was in the\r\ngreatest despair at the obstinate resistance the boy made, and fell\r\ninto the most violent rage. He then threw some perfume on the fire,\r\nand had hardly spoken two magic words, before the stone, which served\r\nto shut up the entrance to the cavern, returned of its own accord to\r\nthe place, with all the earth over it, exactly in the same state as it\r\nwas when the magician and Aladdin first arrived there.\r\n\r\nWhen Aladdin found himself buried alive, he called aloud a thousand\r\ntimes to his uncle, telling him he was ready to give him the lamp.\r\nBut all his cries were useless, and, having no other means of making\r\nhimself heard, he remained in perfect darkness.\r\n\r\nFinally he went down to the bottom of the stairs, intending to go\r\ntoward the light in the garden, where he had been before. But the\r\nwails, which had been opened by enchantment, were now shut by the same\r\nmeans. The poor boy felt all around him several times, but could not\r\ndiscover the least opening. He then redoubled his cries and tears, and\r\nsat down upon the step of his dungeon, without the least hope of ever\r\nseeing the light of day again.\r\n\r\nFor two days Aladdin remained in this state, without either eating\r\nor drinking. On the third day, feeling that his death was near, he\r\nclasped his hands in prayer and said in a loud tone of voice, "There\r\nis no strength or power but in the great and high Heavens." In this\r\nact of joining his hands he happened, without thinking of it, to rub\r\nthe ring which the magician had put upon his finger.\r\n\r\nInstantly a Genius of enormous figure and horrid countenance rose out\r\nof the earth. This Genius, who was so extremely tall that his head\r\ntouched the roof, addressed these words to Aladdin: "What do you wish?\r\nI am ready to obey you as your slave, both I and the other slaves of\r\nthe ring." Weak and terrified, and scarcely daring to hope, Aladdin\r\ncried, "Whoever you are, take me, if you are able, out of this place!"\r\nNo sooner had his lips formed the words than he found himself on the\r\noutside of the cave, at the very spot where the magician had left him.\r\nAlmost unable to believe his good fortune, he arose trembling, and\r\nseeing the city in the distance, made his way back by the same road\r\nover which he had come. Such a long weary road he found it to his\r\nmother\'s door that when he reached it he was fainting from hunger and\r\nfatigue:\r\n\r\nHis mother, whose heart had been almost broken by his long absence,\r\nreceived him joyfully and refreshed him with food. When he had\r\nregained his strength, he told her all, and showed her the lamp and\r\nthe colored fruits and the wonderful ring on his finger. His mother\r\nthought little of the jewels, as she was quite ignorant of their\r\nvalue; so Aladdin put them all behind one of the cushions of the sofa\r\non which they were sitting.\r\n\r\nNext morning when Aladdin awoke, his first thought was that he was\r\nvery hungry and would like some breakfast. "Alas, my child," said his\r\nmother, "I have not a morsel of bread to give you. Last night you ate\r\nall the food in the house. However, I have a little cotton of my own\r\nspinning. I will go and sell it, and buy something for our dinner."\r\n"Keep your cotton, mother, for another time," said Aladdin, "and give\r\nme the lamp which I brought with me yesterday. I will go and sell\r\nthat, and the money will serve us for breakfast and dinner too;\r\nperhaps also for supper."\r\n\r\nAladdin\'s mother took the lamp from the place where she had put it.\r\n"Here it is," she said to her son; "but it is very dirty; if I were to\r\nclean it a little, perhaps it might sell for something more." She then\r\ntook some water and a little fine sand with which to clean it. But she\r\nhad scarcely begun to rub the lamp, when a hideous and gigantic Genius\r\nrose out of the ground before her, and cried with a voice as loud as\r\nthunder, "What do you wish? I am ready to obey you as your slave, both\r\nI and the other slaves of the lamp."\r\n\r\nAladdin\'s mother was much terrified; but Aladdin, who had seen the\r\nGenius in the cavern, did not lose his presence of mind. Seizing the\r\nlamp, he answered in a firm voice, "I am hungry; bring me something to\r\neat." The Genius disappeared, and returned a moment later with a large\r\nsilver basin, which he carried on his head. In it were twelve covered\r\ndishes of the same material, filled with the most delicious meats, and\r\nsix loaves as white as snow upon as many plates, and in his hand he\r\ncarried two silver cups. All these the Genius placed upon the table,\r\nand instantly vanished. When Aladdin\'s mother had recovered from her\r\nfright, they both sat down to their meal, in the greatest delight\r\nimaginable, for never before had they eaten such delicate meats or\r\nseen such splendid dishes.\r\n\r\nThe remains of this feast provided them with food for some days, and\r\nwhen it was all gone, Aladdin sold the silver dishes one by one for\r\ntheir support. In this way they lived happily for several years, for\r\nAladdin had been sobered by his adventure, and now behaved with the\r\ngreatest wisdom and prudence. He took care to visit the principal\r\nshops and public places, speaking only with wise and prudent persons;\r\nand in this way he gathered much wisdom, and grew to be a courteous\r\nand handsome youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALADDIN WEDS THE PRINCESS\r\n\r\nOne day Aladdin told his mother that he intended to ask the Sultan to\r\ngive him his daughter in marriage. "Truly, my son," said his mother,\r\n"you seem to have forgotten that your father was but a poor tailor;\r\nand indeed I do not know who will dare to go and speak to the Sultan\r\nabout it." "You yourself must," said he, decidedly. "I!" cried his\r\nmother, in the greatest surprise; "I go to the Sultan! Not I, indeed;\r\nI will take care that I am not joined to such folly. You know very\r\nwell that no one can make any demand of the Sultan without bringing a\r\nrich present, and where shall such poor folk as we find one?"\r\n\r\nThereupon Aladdin told his mother that while talking with the\r\nmerchants in the bazaar he had learned to know the value of their\r\ngems, and for a long time he had known that nothing which the\r\nmerchants had in their shops was half so fine as those jewels he had\r\nbrought home from the enchanted cave. So his mother took them from\r\nthe drawer where they had been hidden and put them in a dish of fine\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\nAladdin\'s mother, now sure that such a gift was one that could not\r\nfail to please the Sultan, at last agreed to do everything her son\r\nwished. She took the porcelain dish with its precious contents and\r\nfolded it up in a very fine linen cloth. She then took another, less\r\nfine, and tied the four corners of it together, that she might carry\r\nit without trouble. This done, she took the road toward the palace of\r\nthe Sultan.\r\n\r\nTrembling, she told the Sultan of her son\'s boldness, and begged his\r\nmercy for Aladdin and for herself. The Sultan heard her kindly; then\r\nbefore giving any answer to her request, he asked her what she had\r\nwith her so carefully tied up in a linen cloth. Aladdin\'s mother\r\nunfolded the cloths and humbly laid the jewels before him.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to express the surprise which this monarch felt when\r\nhe saw before him such a quantity of the most precious, perfect, and\r\nbrilliant jewels, the size of which was greater than any he had ever\r\nseen before. For some moments he gazed at them, speechless. Then he\r\ntook the present from the hand of Aladdin\'s mother, and exclaimed, in\r\na transport of joy. "Ah! how very beautiful, how very wonderful they\r\nare!"\r\n\r\nThen turning to his grand vizier, he showed him the gems and talked\r\nprivately to him for some minutes. At last he said to Aladdin\'s\r\nmother: "My good woman, I will indeed make your son happy by marrying\r\nhim to the Princess, my daughter, as soon as he shall send me forty\r\nlarge basins of massive gold, quite full of the same varieties of\r\nprecious stones which you have already presented me with, brought by\r\nan equal number of black slaves, each of whom shall be led by a white\r\nslave, young, well-made, handsome, and richly-dressed. These are\r\nthe conditions upon which I am ready to give him the Princess, my\r\ndaughter. Go, my good woman, and I will wait till you bring me his\r\nanswer."\r\n\r\nFull of disappointment, Aladdin\'s mother made her way home, and told\r\nher son the Sultan\'s strange wish. But Aladdin only smiled, and when\r\nhis mother had gone out, he took the lamp and rubbed it. Instantly the\r\nGenius appeared, and Aladdin commanded him to lose no time in bringing\r\nthe present which the Sultan had wished for. The Genius only said that\r\nhis commands should be at once obeyed, and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time the Genius returned with forty black slaves, each\r\ncarrying upon his head a large golden basin of great weight, full of\r\npearls, diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, quite as fine as the jewels\r\nthat Aladdin\'s mother had given the Sultan. Each basin was covered\r\nwith a cloth of silver, embroidered with flowers of gold. There were\r\nalso forty white slaves, as Aladdin had commanded. All these slaves\r\nwith their golden basins entirely filled the house, which was but\r\nsmall, as well as the court in front and the garden behind it.\r\n\r\nAladdin\'s mother now came back and almost fainted when she saw this\r\ngreat crowd and all its magnificence. Aladdin desired her at once to\r\nfollow the procession of slaves to the palace, and present to the\r\nSultan the dowry of the Princess.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of the Sultan at the sight of all these riches is\r\nhardly to be imagined. After gazing upon the slaves with their shining\r\nheaps of jewels, he said to Aladdin\'s mother, "Go, my good woman, and\r\ntell your son that I am waiting with open arms to embrace him!"\r\n\r\nAladdin was so delighted with this news that he could hardly answer\r\nhis mother, and, hastening to his chamber, he shut the door. Once more\r\nhe summoned the Genius, who brought to him garments that shone like\r\nthe sun. The Genius also brought him a splendid charger and twenty\r\nslaves to march on either side of him on the way to the Sultan\'s\r\npalace, all holding purses of gold to scatter among the people.\r\n\r\nIf there had been a crowd before, there was ten times as great a one\r\nnow to watch Aladdin as he rode to the Sultan\'s palace, and to pick\r\nup the gold pieces which were showered by his slaves as he went. The\r\nSultan came down from his throne to greet him, and all was feasting\r\nand joy in the palace.\r\n\r\nAfter the feast the judge drew up a contract of marriage between\r\nAladdin and the beautiful Princess. As soon as this was done, the\r\nSultan asked Aladdin if he wished to remain in the palace and complete\r\nall the ceremonies that day. "Sire," he replied, "however impatient I\r\nmay be to have entire possession of all your majesty\'s bounties, I beg\r\nyou to permit me to wait until I shall have built a palace to receive\r\nthe Princess in, that shall be worthy of her; and for this purpose I\r\nrequest that you will have the goodness to point out a suitable place\r\nfor it near your own, that I may always be ready to pay my court to\r\nyour majesty. I will then neglect nothing to get it finished with all\r\npossible diligence."\r\n\r\n"My son," answered the Sultan, "take the open space before my palace;\r\nbut remember that, to have my happiness complete, I cannot see you\r\nunited too soon to my daughter." Having said this, he again embraced\r\nAladdin, who now took leave of the Sultan as if he had been brought up\r\nand had spent all his life at court.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Aladdin reached home, he again summoned the Genius and\r\ncommanded him to build instantly the most gorgeous palace ever seen,\r\non the spot of ground given by the Sultan. Early the next morning the\r\nGenius appeared. "Sir," said he, "your palace is finished; see if it\r\nis as you wish."\r\n\r\nWords cannot paint the astonishment of the Sultan and all his\r\nhousehold at seeing this gorgeous palace shining in the place which\r\nonly the day before had been empty and bare. The Princess, too,\r\nrejoiced much at the sight. Her marriage with Aladdin was held the\r\nsame day, and their happiness was the greatest that heart could wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALADDIN LOSES AND REGAINS THE LAMP\r\n\r\nFor some months they lived thus, Aladdin showing great kindness to\r\nthe poor, and pleasing all by his generosity. About this time his old\r\nenemy, the African magician, found out by some of his magic arts that\r\nAladdin was alive and enormously rich, instead of being, as he had\r\nsupposed, dead in the enchanted cave. He was filled with rage, and,\r\nvowing to destroy Aladdin, he immediately set out for China. There he\r\nlearned that Aladdin had gone hunting, and was not expected home for\r\nthree or four days.\r\n\r\nThe magician bought a dozen shining new lamps, put them in a basket,\r\nand set out for Aladdin\'s palace. As he came near it he cried, "Who\r\nwill change old lamps for new?"\r\n\r\nWhen he came under the Princess\'s windows, one of her slaves said,\r\n"Come, let us see if the old fool means what he says; there is an ugly\r\nold lamp lying on the cornice of the hall of four-and-twenty windows;\r\nwe will put a new one in its place, if the old fellow is really in\r\nearnest." The Princess having given permission, one of the slaves took\r\nthe lamp to the magician, who willingly gave her the best he had among\r\nhis new ones.\r\n\r\nAs soon as night arrived, the magician summoned the Genius of the lamp\r\nand commanded him to transport him, the palace, and the Princess to\r\nthe remotest corner of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe confusion and grief of the Sultan were terrible when he found the\r\npalace vanished and his daughter lost. The people ran in fear through\r\nthe streets, and the soldiers were sent in search of Aladdin, who had\r\nnot yet returned.\r\n\r\nAladdin was soon found and dragged before the Sultan like a criminal.\r\nHe would have been beheaded had not the Sultan been afraid to enrage\r\nthe people. "Go, wretch!" cried the Sultan; "I grant thee thy life;\r\nbut if ever thou appearest before me again, death shall overtake thee,\r\nunless in forty days thou bringest me tidings of my daughter."\r\n\r\nAladdin, wretched and downfallen, left the palace, not knowing whither\r\nto turn his steps. At length he stopped at a brook to bathe his eyes,\r\nwhich smarted with the tears he had shed. As he stooped, his foot\r\nslipped, and, catching hold of a piece of rock to save himself from\r\nfalling, he pressed the magician\'s ring, which he still wore on his\r\nfinger, and the Genius of the ring appeared before him, saying "What\r\nwould you have?" "Oh; Genius," cried Aladdin, "bring my palace back\r\nwithout delay."\r\n\r\n"What you command," replied the Genius, "is not in my power; you must\r\ncall the Genius of the lamp."\r\n\r\n"Then I command you," said Aladdin, "to transport me to the place\r\nwhere now it stands." Instantly Aladdin found himself beside his own\r\npalace, which stood in a meadow not far from a strange city; and the\r\nPrincess was then walking in her own chamber, weeping for her loss.\r\nHappening to come near to the window, she saw Aladdin under it. And\r\nmaking a sign to him to keep silence, she sent a slave to bring him\r\nin. The Princess and her husband having kissed each other and shed\r\nmany tears, Aladdin said, "Tell me, my Princess, what has become of an\r\nold lamp which I left on the cornice of the hall of four-and-twenty\r\nwindows?"\r\n\r\nThe Princess then told how her slave had exchanged it for a new one,\r\nand said that the tyrant in whose power she was, always carried that\r\nvery lamp in his bosom. Aladdin was then sure that this person was no\r\nother than his old enemy, the African magician.\r\n\r\nAfter talking a long while, they hit upon a plan for getting back\r\nthe lamp. Aladdin went into the city in the disguise of a slave, and\r\nbought a powder. Then the Princess invited the magician to sup with\r\nher. As she had never before shown him the least kindness, he was\r\ndelighted and came. While they were at table, she ordered a slave to\r\nbring two cups of wine, one of which she had prepared by mixing in the\r\npowder. After pretending to taste the one she held in her hand, she\r\nasked the magician to change cups, as was the custom in China. He\r\njoyfully seized the goblet, and drinking it all at a draft, fell\r\nsenseless on the floor.\r\n\r\nAladdin was at hand to snatch the lamp from his bosom. Hastily rubbing\r\nit, he summoned the Genius, who instantly transported the palace and\r\nall it contained back to the place whence they had come.\r\n\r\nSome hours after, the Sultan, who had risen at break of day to mourn\r\nfor his daughter, went to the window to look at the spot which he\r\nexpected to see empty and vacant, and there to his unspeakable joy he\r\nsaw Aladdin\'s palace shining in its place. He summoned his guards and\r\nhastened to embrace his daughter; and during a whole week nothing was\r\nheard but the sound of drums, trumpets, and cymbals, and there were\r\nall kinds of music and feasting, in honor of Aladdin\'s return with the\r\nPrincess.\r\n\r\nSome time after this, the Sultan died, and Aladdin and the Princess\r\nascended the throne. They reigned together many years and left many\r\nnoble sons and daughters at their death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestions for Silent Reading\r\n\r\nSome stories and poems must be read thoughtfully in order to gain the\r\nauthor\'s full meaning; such reading cannot be done rapidly. In other\r\nselections, the meaning can be grasped easily, and the reading can be\r\nrapid; in such cases we read mainly for the story, holding in mind the\r\nvarious incidents as the plot unfolds. Throughout this book certain\r\nstories, particularly those of Part II, may well be read silently and\r\nreported on in class: The following suggestions will help you to gain\r\npower in silent reading:\r\n\r\n(a) Time yourself by the clock as you read each story suggested for\r\nsilent reading; what was your reading speed per page? (b) Test your\r\nability to get the thought quickly from the printed page (1) by noting\r\nhow many of the questions that develop the main thoughts, under\r\nDiscussion, you can answer after one reading, and (2) by telling the\r\nsubstance of the story from an outline. Sometimes this guiding outline\r\nis prepared for you, as in question 19, below; sometimes you are asked\r\nto prepare it. This outline may also be used at the close of the\r\nlesson as a guide in retelling the story. You may have to read parts\r\nof the story again to be able to answer all these questions and to\r\ngive the substance of the story fully. Notice that the rapid silent\r\nreaders in your class generally gain and retain more facts than\r\nthe slow readers do. Try steadily to increase your speed in silent\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nTo supplement and give balance to the lessons in silent reading,\r\ncertain passages notable for their beauty, their force, or their\r\ndramatic quality, are listed, under Class readings, to be read aloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

Ali Baba, on the other hand, had a\r\nwife no better off than himself, and lived in a very poor house. He\r\nsupported his family by cutting wood in the forest, and carrying it on\r\nhis asses to sell about the town.\r\n\r\nOne day Ali Baba went to the forest, and had very nearly finished\r\ncutting as much wood as his asses could carry, when he saw high in the\r\nair a thick cloud of dust, which seemed to be coming toward him.\r\nHe gazed at it for a long time, until he saw a company of men on\r\nhorseback, riding so fast that they were almost hidden by the dust.\r\n\r\nAlthough that part of the country was not often troubled by robbers,\r\nAli Baba thought that these horsemen looked like evil men. Therefore,\r\nwithout thinking at all what might become of his asses, his first and\r\nonly care was to save himself. So he climbed up quickly into a large\r\ntree, the branches of which spread out so close and thick that from\r\nthe midst of them he could see everything that passed, without being\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe robbers rode swiftly up to this very tree, and there alighted. Ali\r\nBaba counted forty of them, and saw that each horseman took the bridle\r\noff his horse and hung over its head a bag filled with barley. Then\r\nthey took their traveling bags, which were so heavy that Ali Baba\r\nthought they must be filled with gold and silver.\r\n\r\nWith his bag on his shoulder, the Captain of the thieves came close to\r\nthe rock, at the very spot where the tree grew in which Ali Baba had\r\nhidden himself. After the rascal had made his way through the shrubs\r\nthat grew there, he cried out, "Open Sesame!" so that Ali Baba\r\ndistinctly heard the words. No sooner were they spoken than a door\r\nopened in the rock. The Captain and all his men passed quickly in, and\r\nthe door closed again.\r\n\r\nThere they stayed for a long time. Ali Baba was compelled to wait in\r\nthe tree with patience, as he was afraid some of them might come out\r\nif he left his hiding-place. At length the door opened, and the forty\r\nthieves came out. After he had seen all the troop pass out before him,\r\nthe Captain exclaimed, "Shut Sesame!" Each man then bridled his horse,\r\nand mounted. When the Captain saw that all were ready, he put himself\r\nat their head, and they rode off as they had come.\r\n\r\nAli Baba did not come down from the tree at once, because he thought\r\nthey might have forgotten something, and be obliged to come back, and\r\nthat he should thus be caught. He watched them as long as he could;\r\nnor did he leave the tree for a long time after he had lost sight of\r\nthem. Then, recalling the words the Captain had used to open and shut\r\nthe door, he made his way through the bushes to it, and called out,\r\n"Open Sesame!" Instantly the door flew wide open!\r\n\r\nAli Baba expected to find only a dark cave, and was very much\r\nastonished at seeing a fine large chamber, dug out of the rock, and\r\nhigher than a man could reach. It received its light from a hole in\r\nthe top of the rock. In it were piled all sorts of rare fruits, bales\r\nof rich merchandise, silk stuffs and brocades, and great heaps of\r\nmoney, both silver and gold, some loose, some in large leather bags.\r\nThe sight of alt these things almost took Ali Baba\'s breath away.\r\n\r\nBut he did not hesitate long as to what he should do. He went boldly\r\ninto the cave, and as soon as he was there, the door shut; but since\r\nhe knew the secret by which to open it, this gave him no fear. Leaving\r\nthe silver, he turned to the gold which was in the bags, and when he\r\nhad gathered enough for loading his three asses, he brought them to\r\nthe rock, loaded them, and so covered the sacks of gold over with wood\r\nthat no one could suspect anything. This done, he went to the door,\r\nand had no sooner said the words, "Shut Sesame," than it closed.\r\n\r\nAnd now Ali Baba took the road to the town; and when he got home, he\r\ndrove his asses into the yard and shut the gate with great care. He\r\nthrew off the wood that hid the gold and carried the bags into the\r\nhouse, where he laid them down in a row before his wife, who was\r\nsitting upon a couch.\r\n\r\nWhen he had told the whole story of the cave and the forty thieves, he\r\nemptied the sacks, making one great heap of gold that quite dazzled\r\nhis wife\'s eyes. His wife began to rejoice in this good fortune, and\r\nwas going to count over the money that lay before her, piece by piece.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do?" said he. "Why, you would never finish\r\ncounting them. I will dig a pit to bury it in; we have no time to\r\nlose."\r\n\r\n"It is right, though," replied the wife, "that we should know about\r\nhow much there may be. I will go and borrow a small grain-measure, and\r\nwhile you are digging the pit, I will find how much there is."\r\n\r\nSo the wife of Ali Baba set off and went to her brother-in-law,\r\nCassim, who lived a short way from her house. Cassim was away from\r\nhome, so she begged his wife to lend her a measure for a few minutes.\r\n"That I will with pleasure," said Cassim\'s wife. She went to seek a\r\nmeasure, but knowing how poor Ali Baba was, she was curious to know\r\nwhat sort of grain his wife wanted to measure; so she put some tallow\r\non the bottom of the measure in such a way that no one would notice\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe wife of Ali Baba returned home, and placing the measure on the\r\nheap of gold, filled it over and over again, till she had measured the\r\nwhole. Ali Baba by this time had dug the pit for it, and while he\r\nwas burying the gold, his wife went back with the measure to her\r\nsister-in-law, but without noticing that a piece of gold had stuck to\r\nthe bottom of it.\r\n\r\nThe wife of Ali Baba had scarcely turned her back, when Cassim\'s wife\r\nlooked at the bottom of the measure, and was astonished to see a piece\r\nof gold sticking to it. "What!" said she, "Ali Baba measures his gold!\r\nWhere can the wretch have got it?" When her husband Cassim came home,\r\nshe said to him, "Cassim, you think you are rich, but Ali Baba must\r\nhave far more wealth than you; he does not count his gold as you do;\r\nhe measures it." Then she showed him the piece of money she had found\r\nsticking to the bottom of the measure--a coin so ancient that the name\r\nof the prince engraved on it was unknown to her.\r\n\r\nFar from feeling glad at the good fortune which his brother had met\r\nwith, Cassim grew so jealous of Ali Baba that he passed almost the\r\nwhole night without closing his eyes. The next morning before sunrise\r\nhe went to him. "Ali Baba," said he, harshly, "you pretend to be poor\r\nand miserable and a beggar, and yet you measure your money"--here\r\nCassim showed him the piece Of gold his wife had given him. "How many\r\npieces," added he, "have you like this, that my wife found sticking to\r\nthe bottom of the measure yesterday?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASSIM VISITS THE CAVE\r\n\r\nFrom this speech Ali Baba knew that Cassim, and his wife also, must\r\nsuspect what had happened. So, without showing the least sign of\r\nsurprise, he told Cassim by what chance he had found the retreat\'\r\nof the thieves, and where it was; and offered, if he would keep the\r\nsecret, to share the treasure with him.\r\n\r\n"This I certainly expect," replied Cassim in a haughty tone;\r\n"otherwise I will inform the police of it." Ali Baba, led rather by\r\nhis good nature than by fear, told him all, even to the words he must\r\npronounce, both on entering the cave and on quitting it. Cassim made\r\nno further inquiries of Ali Baba; he left him, determined to seize the\r\nwhole treasure, and set off the next morning before break of day with\r\nten mules laden with large hampers which he proposed to fill. He took\r\nthe road which Ali Baba had pointed out, and arrived at the rock and\r\nthe tree; on looking for the door, he soon discovered it. When he\r\ncried, "Open Sesame!" the door obeyed; he entered, and it closed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nGreedy as Cassim was, he could have passed the whole day in feasting\r\nhis eyes with the sight of so much gold; but he remembered that he had\r\ncome to take away as much as he could; he therefore filled his sacks,\r\nand coming to the door, he found that he had forgotten the secret\r\nwords, and instead of saying, "Open Sesame" he said, "Open Barley." So\r\nthe door, instead of flying open, remained closed. He named various\r\nother kinds of grain; all but the right one were called upon, and\r\nstill the door did not move.\r\n\r\nThe thieves returned to their cave toward noon; and when they were\r\nwithin a short distance of it, and saw the mules belonging to Cassim\r\nladen with hampers, standing about the rock, they were a good deal\r\nsurprised. They drove away the ten mules, which took to flight in\r\nthe forest. Then the Captain and his men, with their sabers in their\r\nhands, went toward the door and said, "Open Sesame!" At once it flew\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nCassim, who from the inside of the cave heard the horses trampling\r\non the ground, did not doubt that the thieves had come, and that his\r\ndeath was near. Resolved, however, on one effort to escape and reach\r\nsome place of safety, he placed himself near the door ready to run out\r\nas soon as it should open. The word "Sesame" was scarcely pronounced\r\nwhen it opened, and he rushed out with such violence that he threw\r\nthe Captain to the ground. He could not, however, escape the other\r\nthieves, who slew him on the spot.\r\n\r\nOn entering the cave the thieves found, near the door, the sacks which\r\nCassim had filled, but they could not imagine how he had been able to\r\nget in.\r\n\r\nThe wife of Cassim, in the meantime, was in the greatest uneasiness\r\nwhen night came and her husband did not return. After waiting as long\r\nas she could, she went in the utmost alarm to Ali Baba, and said to\r\nhim, "Brother, I believe you know that Cassim has gone to the forest;\r\nhe has not yet come back, although it is almost morning. I fear some\r\naccident may have befallen him."\r\n\r\nAli Baba did not wait for entreaties to go and seek for Cassim. He\r\nimmediately set off with his three asses, and went to the forest. As\r\nhe drew near the rock, he was astonished to see that blood had been\r\nshed near the cave. When he reached the door, he said, "Open Sesame!"\r\nand it opened.\r\n\r\nHe was shocked to see his brother\'s body in the cave. He decided to\r\ncarry it home, and placed it on one of his asses, covering it with\r\nsticks to conceal it. The other two asses he quickly loaded with sacks\r\nof gold, putting wood over them as before. Then, commanding the door\r\nto close, he took the road to the city, waiting in the forest till\r\nnightfall, that he might return without being observed. When he got\r\nhome, he left the two asses that were laden with gold for his wife to\r\nunload; and having told her what had happened, he led the other ass to\r\nhis sister-in-law\'s. Ali Baba knocked at the door, which was opened\r\nto him by Morgiana, who was a female slave, clever, and full of\r\ninvention. "Morgiana," said he, "the first thing I have to ask you is\r\nto keep a deep secret! This packet contains the body of your master,\r\nand we must bury him as if he had died a natural death. Let me speak\r\nto your mistress, and hearken what I say to her."\r\n\r\nMorgiana went to call her mistress, and Ali Baba then told her\r\nall that had happened before his arrival with the body of Cassim.\r\n"Sister," added he, "here is a sad affliction for you, but we must\r\ncontrive to bury my brother as if he had died a natural death; and\r\nthen we shall be glad to offer you a shelter under our own roof."\r\n\r\nThe widow of Cassim reflected that she could not do better than\r\nconsent. She therefore wiped away her tears, and suppressed her\r\nmournful cries, and thereby showed Ali Baba that she accepted his\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nAli Baba left her in this frame of mind, and Morgiana went out with\r\nhim to an apothecary\'s there. She knocked at the shop door, and when\r\nit was opened, asked for a particular kind of lozenge of great effect\r\nin dangerous illness. The apothecary gave her the lozenge, asking who\r\nwas ill in her master\'s family. "Ah!" exclaimed she with a deep sigh,\r\n"it is my worthy master, Cassim himself. He can neither speak nor\r\neat!"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as Ali Baba and his wife were seen going backwards and\r\nforwards to the house of Cassim, in the course of the day, no one was\r\nsurprised on hearing in the evening the piercing cries of his widow\r\nand Morgiana, which announced his death.\r\n\r\nAnd so the body of Cassim was prepared for its burial, which took\r\nplace the next day, attended by Ali Baba and Morgiana.\r\n\r\nAs for his widow, she remained at home to lament and weep with her\r\nneighbors, who, according to the usual custom, repaired to her house\r\nduring the ceremony of the burial, and joining their cries to hers,\r\nfilled the air with sounds of woe. Thus the manner of Cassim\'s death\r\nwas so well hidden that no one in the city knew anything about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROBBERS SEEK REVENGE ON ALI BABA\r\n\r\nBut let us now leave Ali Baba and Morgiana, and return to the forty\r\nthieves. When they came back to their cave, they found the body of\r\nCassim gone, and with it much of their treasure. "We are discovered,"\r\nsaid the Captain, "and we shall be lost if we are not very careful.\r\nAll that we can at present tell is that the man whom we killed in the\r\nCave knew the secret of opening the door. But he was not the only one;\r\nanother must have found it out too. Having slain one, we must not let\r\nthe other escape. Well, the first thing to be done is that one of you\r\nshould go to the city in the dress of a traveler, and try to learn who\r\nthe man we killed was."\r\n\r\nThe thief who agreed to carry out this plan, having disguised himself\r\nso that no one could have told who he was, set off at night, and\r\nentered the city just at dawn. By asking questions in the town he\r\ndiscovered that a body had been prepared for burial at a certain\r\nhouse. Having found the house, the thief marked the door with chalk\r\nand returned to the forest.\r\n\r\nVery soon after this, Morgiana had occasion to go out, and saw the\r\nmark which the thief had made on the door of Ali Baba\'s house. "What\r\ncan this mark mean?" thought she; "has anyone a spite against my\r\nmaster, or has it been done only for fun? In any ease, it will be well\r\nto guard against the worst that may happen." She therefore took some\r\nchalk, and as several of the doors, both above and below her master\'s,\r\nwere alike, she marked them in the same manner, and then went in\r\nwithout saying anything of what she had done either to her master or\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nThe thief in the meantime arrived at the forest, and related the\r\nsuccess of his journey. They all listened to him with great delight,\r\nand the Captain, after praising him, said, "Comrades, we have no time\r\nto lose; let us arm ourselves and depart, and when we have entered the\r\ncity, which we had best do separately, let us all meet in the great\r\nsquare, and I will go and find out the house with the chalk mark."\r\nThus the thieves \'went in small parties of two or three to the city\r\nwithout causing any suspicion. The thief who had been there in the\r\nmorning then led the Captain to the street in which he had marked the\r\nhouse of Ali Baba.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the first house that had been marked by Morgiana, he\r\npointed it out, saying that was the one. But as they continued walking\r\non, the Captain saw that the next door was marked in the same manner.\r\nAt this the thief was quite confused, and knew not what to say; for\r\nthey found four or five doors more with the same mark.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, who was in great anger, returned to the square, and told\r\nthe first of his men whom he met to tell the rest that they had lost\r\ntheir labor, and that nothing remained but to return to the forest.\r\n\r\nWhen they had reached the forest, the Captain declared the mistaken\r\nthief deserving of death, and he was at once killed by his companions.\r\n\r\nNext day another thief, in spite of this, determined to succeed where\r\nthe other had failed. He went to the city, found the house, and marked\r\nthe door of it with red. But, a short time after. Morgiana; vent out\r\nand saw the red mark and did not fail to make a similar red mark on\r\nthe neighboring doors.\r\n\r\nThe thief when he returned to the forest boasted of his success, and\r\nthe Captain and the rest repaired to the city with as much care as\r\nbefore, and the Captain and his guide went immediately to the street\r\nwhere Ali Baba resided; but the same thing occurred as before.\r\n\r\nThus they were obliged to return again to the forest disappointed. The\r\nsecond thief was put to death as a punishment for deceiving them.\r\n\r\nNext time the Captain himself went to the city, and found the house of\r\nAli Baba. But not choosing to amuse himself by making marks on it, he\r\nexamined it so well, not only by looking at it. But by passing before\r\nit several times, that at last he was certain he could not mistake it.\r\n\r\nThereupon he returned to the forest, and told the thieves he had\r\nmade sure of the house, and had made a plan such that at last he was\r\ncertain he could not mistake it. And first he ordered them to divide\r\ninto small parties, and go into the neighboring towns and villages and\r\nbuy nineteen mules and thirty-eight large leather jars to carry oil,\r\none of which must be full, and all the others empty.\r\n\r\nIn the course of two or three days the thieves returned, and the\r\nCaptain made one of his men enter each jar, armed as he thought\r\nnecessary. Then he closed the jars as if each were full of oil,\r\nleaving, however, a small slit open to admit air.\r\n\r\nThings being thus disposed, the mules were laden with the thirty-seven\r\nthieves, each concealed in a jar, and the jar that was filled with\r\noil; whereupon the Captain took the road to the city at the hour that\r\nhad been agreed, and arrived about an hour after sunset. He went\r\nstraight to the house of Ali Baba, where he found Ali Baba at the\r\ndoor, enjoying the fresh air after supper. "Sir," said he, "I have\r\nbrought oil from a great distance to sell tomorrow at the market, and\r\nI do not know where to go to pass the night; if it would not occasion\r\nyou much trouble, do me the favor to take me in."\r\n\r\nAlthough Ali Baba had seen, in the forest, the man who now spoke to\r\nhim and had even heard his voice, yet he had no idea that this was the\r\nCaptain of the forty robbers, disguised as an oil merchant. "You are\r\nwelcome," said he, and took him into the house, and his mules into the\r\nstable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OIL MERCHANT IN THE HOME OF ALI BABA\r\n\r\nAli Baba, having told Morgiana to see that his guest wanted nothing,\r\nadded, "Tomorrow before daybreak I shall go to the bath. Make me some\r\ngood broth to take when I return." After giving these orders, he went\r\nto bed. In the meantime the Captain of the thieves, on leaving the\r\nstable, went to give his people orders what to do. Beginning with the\r\nfirst jar, and going through the whole number, he said to each, "When\r\nI shall throw some pebbles from my chamber, do not fail to rip open\r\nthe jar from top to bottom with the knife you have, and to come out; I\r\nshall be with you soon after." The knives he spoke of were sharpened\r\nfor the purpose. This done, he returned, and Morgiana took a light,\r\nand led him to his chamber. Not to cause any suspicion, he put out the\r\nlight and lay down in his clothes, to be ready to rise as soon as he\r\nhad taken his first sleep.\r\n\r\nMorgiana did not forget Ali Baba\'s orders; she prepared his linen for\r\nthe bath and gave it to Abdalla, Ali Baba\'s slave, who had not yet\r\ngone to bed. Then she put the pot on the fire to make the broth, but\r\nwhile she was skimming it. The lamp went out. There was no more oil\r\nin the house, and she had no candle. She did not know what to do. She\r\nwanted a light to see to skim the pot, and mentioned it to Abdalla.\r\n"Take some oil," said he, "out of one of the jars in the court."\r\n\r\nMorgiana accordingly took the oil-can and went into the court. As she\r\ndrew near the first jar, the thief who was concealed within said in a\r\nlow voice, "Is it time?"\r\n\r\nAny other slave except Morgiana, in the first moment of surprise at\r\nfinding a man in the jar instead of some oil, would have made a great\r\nuproar. But Morgiana collected her thoughts, and without showing any\r\nemotion assumed the voice of the Captain, and answered, "Not yet,\r\nbut presently." She approached the next jar, and the others in turn,\r\nmaking the same answer to the same question, till she came to the\r\nlast, which was full of oil.\r\n\r\nMorgiana by this means discovered that her master, who supposed he was\r\ngiving a night\'s lodging to an oil merchant only, had afforded shelter\r\nto thirty-eight robbers, including the pretended merchant, their\r\nCaptain. She quickly filled her oil-can from the last jar, and\r\nreturned to the kitchen; and after having put some oil in her lamp and\r\nlighted it, she took a large kettle, and went again into the court to\r\nfill it with oil from the jar. This done, she brought it back again,\r\nput it over the tire, and made a great blaze under it with a quantity\r\nof wood; for the sooner the oil boiled, the sooner her plan would be\r\ncarried out. At length the oil boiled. She then took the kettle and\r\npoured into each jar, from the first to the last, enough boiling oil\r\nto kill the robbers.\r\n\r\nThis being done without any noise, she returned to the kitchen with\r\nthe empty kettle, and shut the door. She put out the large fire she\r\nhad made up for this purpose, and left only enough to finish boiling\r\nthe broth for Ali Baba. She then blew out the lamp and remained\r\nperfectly silent, determined not to go to bed until she had watched\r\nwhat would happen, from a window which overlooked the court.\r\n\r\nMorgiana had waited scarcely a quarter of an hour, when the Captain of\r\nthe robbers awoke. He got up, and opening the window, looked out. All\r\nwas dark and silent; he gave the signal by throwing the pebbles, many\r\nof which fell on the jars, as the sound plainly proved. He listened,\r\nbut heard nothing that could lead him to suppose his men obeyed the\r\nsummons. He became uneasy at this delay, and threw some pebbles down a\r\nsecond time, and even a third. They all struck the jars, yet nothing\r\nmoved, and he became frightened.\r\n\r\nHe went down into the court in the utmost alarm; and going up to the\r\nfirst jar, he was going to ask if the robber contained in it was\r\nasleep. As soon as he drew near, he smelled a strong scent of hot and\r\nburning oil coming out of the jar. From this he feared that his wicked\r\nplan had failed. He went to the next jar, and to each in turn, and\r\ndiscovered that all his men were dead. Terrified at this, he jumped\r\nover the garden-gate, and going from one garden to another by getting\r\nover the walls, he made his escape. Before daybreak Ali Baba, followed\r\nby his slave, went out and repaired to the bath, totally ignorant of\r\nthe surprising events that had taken place in his house during his\r\nsleep. Morgiana had not thought it necessary to wake him, particularly\r\nas she had no time to lose, while she was engaged in her perilous\r\nenterprise, and it was useless to disturb him after she had averted\r\nthe danger.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned from the bath, the sun being risen, Ali Baba was\r\nsurprised to see the jars of oil still in their places; he inquired\r\nthe reason of Morgiana, who let him in, and who had left everything as\r\nit was, in order to show it to him.\r\n\r\n"My good master," said Morgiana to Ali Baba\'s question, "may God\r\npreserve you and all your family. You will soon know the reason,\r\nif you will take the trouble to come with me." Ali Baba followed\r\nMorgiana, and when she had shut the door, she took him to the first\r\njar and bade him look in and see if it contained oil. He did as she\r\ndesired; and seeing a man in the jar, he hastily drew back and uttered\r\na cry of surprise. "Do not be afraid," said she; "the man you see\r\nthere will not do you any harm; he will never hurt either you or\r\nanyone else again, for he is now a corpse."\r\n\r\n"Morgiana!" exclaimed Ali Baba, "what does all this mean? You explain\r\nthis mystery." "I will explain it," replied Morgiana, "but pray be\r\ncautious, and do not awaken the curiosity of your neighbors to learn\r\nwhat it is of the utmost importance that you should keep secret and\r\nconcealed. Look first at all the other jars."\r\n\r\nAli Baba examined all the rest of the jars, one after the other, from\r\nthe first till he came to the last, which contained the oil, and\r\nhe noticed that its oil was nearly all gone. This done, he stood,\r\nsometimes casting his eyes on Morgiana, then looking at the jars, yet\r\nwithout speaking a word, so great was his surprise. At length he said,\r\n"And what has become of the merchant?"\r\n\r\n"The merchant," replied Morgiana, "is just as much a merchant as I am.\r\nI can tell you who he is."\r\n\r\nShe then described the marks made upon the door, and the way in which\r\nshe had copied them, adding: "You see this is a plot contrived by\r\nthe thieves of the forest, whose troop, I know not how, seems to be\r\ndiminished by two. But be that as it may, it is now reduced to three\r\nat most. This proves that they are determined on your death, and you\r\nwill do right to be on your guard against them, so long as you are\r\ncertain that even one of the robbers remains."\r\n\r\nAli Baba, full of gratitude for all he owed her, replied, "I will\r\nreward you as you deserve, before I die. I owe my life to you, and\r\nfrom this moment I give you your liberty, and wilt soon do still more\r\nfor you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORGIANA\'S GREAT COURAGE AND REWARD\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Captain of the forty thieves had returned to the forest\r\nfull of rage, and determined to revenge himself on Ali Baba.\r\n\r\nNext morning he awoke at an early hour, put on a merchant\'s dress,\r\nand returned to the city, where he took a lodging in a khan. Then he\r\nbought a horse, which he made use of to convey to his lodging several\r\nkinds of rich stuffs and fine linens, bringing them from the forest at\r\nvarious times. In order to dispose of these wares, he took a shop,\r\nand established himself in it. This shop was exactly opposite to that\r\nwhich had been Cassim\'s, and was now occupied by the son of Ali Baba.\r\n\r\nThe Captain of the thieves, who had taken the name of Cogia Houssam,\r\nsoon succeeded in making friends with the son of Ali Baba, who was\r\nyoung and good-natured. He often invited the youth to sup with him,\r\nand made him rich gifts.\r\n\r\nWhen Ali Baba heard of it, he resolved to make a return for this\r\nkindness, to Cogia Houssam, little thinking that the pretended\r\nmerchant was really the Captain of the thieves. So one day he asked\r\nCogia Houssam to do him the honor of supping and spending the evening\r\nat his house. "Sir," replied Cogia, "I am grateful for your kindness,\r\nbut I must beg you to excuse me, and for a reason which I am sure you\r\nwill think sufficient. It is this: I never eat of any dish that has\r\nsalt in it; judge, then, of the figure I should make at your table."\r\n"If this be your only reason," replied Ali Baba, "it need not prevent\r\nyour coming to supper with me. The bread which is eaten in my house\r\ndoes not contain any salt; and as for the meat and other dishes, I\r\npromise you there shall be none in those which are served before you."\r\n\r\nSo Ali Baba went into the kitchen, and desired Morgiana not to put\r\nany salt in the meat she was going to serve for supper, and also to\r\nprepare two or three dishes of those that he had ordered, without any\r\nsalt. Morgiana obeyed, though much against her will; and she felt some\r\ncuriosity to see this man who did not eat salt. When she had finished,\r\nand Abdalla had prepared the table, she helped him in carrying the\r\ndishes. On looking at Cogia Houssam, she instantly recognized the\r\nCaptain of the robbers, in spite of his disguise; and looking at him\r\nmore closely, she saw that he had a dagger hidden under his dress. "I\r\nam no longer surprised," said she to herself, "that this villain will\r\nnot eat salt with my master; he is his enemy, and means to murder him!\r\nBut I wilt prevent the villain!"\r\n\r\nWhen the supper was ended, the Captain of the thieves thought that the\r\ntime for revenging himself on Ali Baba had come. "I will make them\r\nboth drink much wine," thought he, "and then the son, against whom I\r\nbear no malice, will not prevent my plunging my dagger into the heart\r\nof his father, and I shall escape by way of the garden, as I did\r\nbefore, while the cook and the slave are at their supper in the\r\nkitchen."\r\n\r\nInstead, however, of going to supper, Morgiana did not allow him time\r\nto carry out his wicked plans. She dressed herself as a dancer, put\r\non a headdress suitable to that character, and wore round her waist a\r\nfancy girdle of gilt, to which she fastened a dagger, made of the same\r\nmetal. Her face was hidden by a very handsome mask. When she had so\r\ndisguised herself, she said to Abdalla, "Take your tabor, and let us\r\ngo and entertain our master\'s guest, who is the friend of his son, as\r\nwe do sometimes by our performances."\r\n\r\nAbdalla took his tabor and began to play, as he walked before\r\nMorgiana, and entered the room. Morgiana followed him, making a low\r\ncurtsy, and performed several dances, with equal grace and agility. At\r\nlength she drew out the dagger, and dancing with it in her hand, she\r\nsurpassed all she had yet done, by her light movements and high leaps;\r\nsometimes presenting the dagger as if to strike, and at others holding\r\nit to her own bosom, as if to stab herself. At length, as if out\r\nof breath, she took the tabor from Abdalla with her left hand, and\r\nholding the dagger in her right, she held out the tabor to Ali Baba,\r\nwho threw a piece of gold into it. Morgiana then held the tabor out to\r\nhis son, who did the same. Cogia Houssam, who saw that she was coming\r\nto him next, had already taken his purse from his bosom, and was\r\nputting his hand in it, when Morgiana, with great courage, suddenly\r\nplunged the dagger into his heart.\r\n\r\nAli Baba and his son, terrified at this action, uttered a loud cry:\r\n"Wretch!" exclaimed Ali Baba, "what hast thou done? Thou hast ruined\r\nme and my family forever."\r\n\r\n"What I have done," replied Morgiana, "is not for your ruin, but for\r\nyour safety." Then opening Cogia Houssam\'s robe to show Ali Baba the\r\nponiard which was concealed under it, "See," continued she, "the cruel\r\nenemy you had to deal with; examine him, and you will recognize the\r\npretended oil-merchant and the Captain of the forty thieves! Do\r\nyou now see why he refused to eat salt with you? Can you require a\r\nstronger proof of his treachery?"\r\n\r\nAli Baba, who now saw all that he owed to Morgiana for having thus\r\nsaved his life a second time, cried, "Morgiana, I gave you your\r\nliberty, and at the same time promised to do more for you at some\r\nfuture time. This time has come, and I present you to my son as his\r\nwife." A few days after, Ali Baba had the marriage of his son and\r\nMorgiana celebrated with great feasting.\r\n\r\nAfter the marriage, Ali Baba decided to visit again the cave of the\r\nforty thieves. On reaching it he repeated the word, "Open Sesame." At\r\nonce the door opened, and he entered the cave, and found that no one\r\nhad been in it from the time that Cogia Houssam had opened his shop\r\nin the city. He therefore knew that the whole troop of thieves was\r\nkilled, and that he was the only person in the world who knew the\r\nsecret of the cave.\r\n\r\nFrom that time Ali Baba and his son, whom he took to the cave and\r\ntaught the secret of how to enter it, enjoyed its riches with\r\nmoderation and lived in great happiness and comfort to the end of\r\ntheir long lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

One day he was carrying a heavy burden\r\nfrom one end of the town to the other; being weary, he took off his\r\nload and sat upon it, near a large mansion.\r\n\r\nHe knew not who owned the mansion; but he went to the servants and\r\nasked the name of the master. "How," replied one of them, "do you live\r\nin Baghdad, and know not that this is the house of Sindbad the sailor,\r\nthat famous voyager, who has sailed round the world?"\r\n\r\nThe porter said, loud enough to be heard, "Almighty Creator of all\r\nthings, consider the difference between Sindbad and me! I work\r\nfaithfully every day and suffer hardships, and can scarcely get barley\r\nbread for myself and family, while happy Sindbad spends riches and\r\nleads a life of continual pleasure. What has he done to obtain a lot\r\nso agreeable? And what have I done to deserve one so wretched?"\r\n\r\nWhile the porter was thus complaining, a servant came out of the house\r\nand said to him, "Sindbad, my master, wishes to speak to you. Come\r\nin."\r\n\r\nThe servants took him into a great hall, where a number of people sat\r\naround a table covered with all sorts of savory dishes. At the upper\r\nend was a tall, grave gentleman, with a long white beard, and behind\r\nhim stood a number of officers and servants, all ready to attend his\r\npleasure. This person was Sindbad. Hindbad, whose fear was increased\r\nat the sight of so many people and of so great a feast, saluted the\r\ncompany tremblingly. Sindbad bade him draw near, and seating him at\r\nhis right hand, served him himself.\r\n\r\nNow, Sindbad had heard the porter complain, and this it was that led\r\nhim to have the man brought in. When the repast was over, Sindbad\r\nspoke to Hindbad, asked his name and business, and said: "I wish to\r\nhear from your own mouth what it was you said in the street."\r\n\r\nHindbad replied, "My lord, I confess that my weariness put me out\r\nof humor, and made me utter some foolish words, which I beg you to\r\npardon." "Do not think I am so unjust," resumed Sindbad, "as to blame\r\nyou. But you are mistaken about me, and I wish to set you right. You\r\nthink that I have gained without labor and trouble the ease and plenty\r\nwhich I now enjoy. But make no mistake; I did not reach this happy\r\ncondition without suffering for several years more trouble of body and\r\nmind than can well be imagined. Yes, gentlemen," he added, speaking\r\nto the whole company, "I assure you that my sufferings have been so\r\nextraordinary that they would make the greatest miser lose his love\r\nof riches; and I will, with your leave, tell of the dangers I have\r\novercome, which I think will not be uninteresting to you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SAILOR\r\n\r\nHe then told the following story:\r\n\r\nMy father was a wealthy merchant, much respected by everyone. He left\r\nme a large fortune, which I wasted in wild living. I then remembered\r\nSolomon\'s saying, "A good name is better than precious ointment," and\r\nresolved to walk in my father\'s ways. I therefore made arrangements to\r\ngo on a voyage with some merchants.\r\n\r\nAfter touching at many places where we sold or exchanged goods, we\r\nwere becalmed near a small island which looked like a green meadow.\r\nThe captain permitted some of us to land, but while we were eating and\r\ndrinking, the island began to shake, and he called to us to return to\r\nthe ship. What we thought was an island was really the back of a sea\r\nmonster. I had just time to catch hold of a piece of wood, when the\r\nisland disappeared into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe captain, thinking I was drowned, resolved to make use of a\r\nfavorable gale, which had just risen, to continue his voyage. I was\r\ntossed by the waves all that day and night, but the next day I was\r\nthrown upon an island. I was very feeble, but I crept along and found\r\na spring of water, which did much to restore my strength.\r\n\r\nAfter this I went farther into the island and saw a man watching some\r\nhorses that were feeding near by. He was much surprised to see me and\r\ntook me to a cave where there were several other men. They told me\r\nthey were grooms of the Maharaja, ruler of the island, and that every\r\nyear they brought his horses to this uninhabited place for pasturage.\r\n\r\nNext morning they returned to the capital of the island, taking me\r\nwith them. They presented me to the Maharaja, who ordered his people\r\nto care for me. The capital has a fine harbor, where ships arrive\r\ndaily from all parts of the world, and I hoped soon to have a chance\r\nto return to Baghdad.\r\n\r\nOne day the ship arrived in which I had sailed from home. I went to\r\nthe captain and asked for my goods. "I am Sindbad," I said, "and those\r\nbales marked with his name are mine." At first the captain did not\r\nknow me, but after looking at me closely, he cried, "Heaven be praised\r\nfor your happy escape. These are your goods; take them and do what you\r\nplease with them."\r\n\r\nI made a present of my choicest goods to the Maharaja, who asked me\r\nhow I came by such rarities. When I told him, he was much pleased and\r\ngave me many valuable things in return. After exchanging my goods for\r\naloes, sandalwood, camphor, nutmegs, cloves, pepper, and ginger, I\r\nsailed for home and at last reached Baghdad with goods worth one\r\nhundred thousand sequins.\r\n\r\nSindbad stopped here and ordered the musicians to proceed with their\r\nconcert. When it was evening, Sindbad gave the porter a purse of one\r\nhundred sequins and told him to come back the next day to hear more of\r\nhis adventures.\r\n\r\nHindbad put on his best robe the next day and returned to the\r\nbountiful traveler, who welcomed him heartily. When all the guests\r\nhad arrived, dinner was served and continued a long time. When it was\r\nended, Sindbad said, "Gentlemen, hear now the adventures of my second\r\nvoyage. They deserve your attention even more than those of the\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SAILOR\r\n\r\nI planned, after my first voyage, to spend the rest of my days at\r\nBaghdad, but I grew weary of an idle life, and put to sea a second\r\ntime, with merchants I knew to be honorable. We embarked on board a\r\ngood ship and set sail. We traded from island to island, and exchanged\r\ngoods with great profit.\r\n\r\nOne day we landed on an island covered with fruit-trees, but we could\r\nsee neither man nor animal. We walked in the meadows and along the\r\nstreams that watered them. While some gathered flowers and others\r\nfruits, I took my wine and provisions and sat down near a stream\r\nbetween two high trees, which formed a thick shade. I made a good\r\nmeal, and afterwards fell asleep. I cannot tell how long I slept, but\r\nwhen I awoke, the ship was gone.\r\n\r\nIn this sad condition, I was ready to die with grief. I was sorry that\r\nI had not been satisfied with the profits of my first voyage, that\r\nmight have been enough for me all my life. But my repentance came too\r\nlate. At last I took courage and, not knowing what to do, climbed to\r\nthe top of a lofty tree and looked about on all sides to see if I\r\ncould discover anything that could give me hope. Toward the sea I\r\ncould see nothing but sky and water; but looking over the land, I\r\nbeheld something white, and, coming down, I took what provisions I had\r\nleft and went toward it, the distance being so great that I could not\r\ntell what it was.\r\n\r\nAs I came nearer, I thought it was a white dome, of great height and\r\nsize; and when I came up to it, I touched it and found it to be very\r\nsmooth. I went around to see if it was open on any side, but saw it\r\nwas not, and that there was no climbing up to the top, as it was so\r\nsmooth. It was at least fifty paces around.\r\n\r\nBy this time the sun was about to set, and all of a sudden the sky\r\nbecame as dark as if it had been covered with a thick cloud. I was\r\nmuch astonished at this sudden darkness, but much more when I found it\r\nwas caused by a bird of monstrous size, that came flying toward me. I\r\nremembered that I had often heard sailors speak of a wonderful bird\r\ncalled the roc, and saw that the great dome which I so much admired\r\nmust be its egg. The bird alighted, and sat over the egg.\r\n\r\nAs I saw it coming, I crept close to the egg, so that I had before me\r\none of the legs of the bird, which was as big as the trunk of a tree.\r\nI tied myself strongly to it with my turban, hoping that the roc next\r\nmorning would carry me out of this desert island.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the night in this condition, the bird flew away as soon\r\nas it was daylight, and carried me so high that I could not see the\r\nearth; it afterwards descended so swiftly that I lost my senses. But\r\nwhen I found myself on the ground, I speedily untied the knot, and had\r\nscarcely done so when the roc, having taken up a serpent in its bill,\r\nflew away.\r\n\r\nThe spot where it left me was surrounded by mountains that seemed\r\nto reach above the clouds, and so steep that there was no chance of\r\ngetting out of the valley. When I compared this place with the desert\r\nisland from which the roc had brought me, I found that I had gained\r\nnothing by the change.\r\n\r\nAs I walked through this valley, I saw it was strewn with diamonds,\r\nsome of which were of a surprising size. I had never believed what I\r\nhad heard sailors tell of the valley of diamonds, and of the tricks\r\nused by merchants to obtain jewels from that place; but now I found\r\nthat they had stated nothing but the truth. For the fact is that the\r\nmerchants come to this valley when the eagles have young ones, and\r\nthrow great joints of meat into the valley; the diamonds, upon whose\r\npoints they fall, stick to them; the eagles pounce upon those pieces\r\nof meat and carry them to their nests on the rocks to feed their\r\nyoung; the merchants at this time run to the nests, drive off the\r\neagles, and take away the diamonds that stick to the meat.\r\n\r\nI had thought the valley must surely be my grave, but now I took\r\ncourage and began to plan a way to escape. Collecting the largest\r\ndiamonds and putting them into the leather bag in which I used to\r\ncarry my provisions, I took the largest of the pieces of meat, tied it\r\nclose around me, and then lay down upon the ground, face downwards,\r\nthe bag of diamonds being made fast to my girdle. I had scarcely\r\nplaced myself in this position when one of the eagles, having taken me\r\nup with the piece of meat to which I was fastened, carried me to his\r\nnest on the top of the mountain. The merchants frightened the eagles,\r\nand when they had forced them to quit their prey, one of them came\r\nto the nest where I was. He was much alarmed when he saw me; but,\r\nrecovering himself, instead of asking how I came thither, began to\r\nquarrel with me, and asked why I stole his goods.\r\n\r\n"You will treat me," replied I, "with more politeness when you know me\r\nbetter. Do not be uneasy; I have diamonds enough for you and myself,\r\nmore than all the other merchants together. Whatever they have they\r\nowe to chance, but I selected for myself in the bottom of the valley\r\nthose which you see in this bag."\r\n\r\nI had scarcely done speaking when the other merchants came crowding\r\nabout us, much astonished to see me, but more surprised when I told\r\nthem my story.\r\n\r\nThey took me to their camp, and there, when I opened my bag, they were\r\nsurprised at the beauty of my diamonds, and confessed that they had\r\nnever seen any of such size and perfection.\r\n\r\nI prayed the merchant who owned the nest to which I had been carried,\r\nfor every merchant had his own nest, to take as many for his share as\r\nhe pleased. He, however, took only one, and that, too, the least of\r\nthem; and when I pressed him to take more, he said, "No, I am very\r\nwell satisfied with this gem, which is valuable enough to save me the\r\ntrouble of making any more voyages, and will bring as great a fortune\r\nas I desire."\r\n\r\nThe merchants had thrown their pieces of meat into the valley for\r\nseveral days; and each of them being satisfied with the diamonds\r\nthat had fallen to his lot, we left the place and traveled near high\r\nmountains, where there were serpents of great length, which we had the\r\nfortune to escape.\r\n\r\nWe took shipping at the first port we reached, and touched at the isle\r\nof Roha, where the trees grow that yield camphor.\r\n\r\nI pass over many other things peculiar to this island, lest I should\r\nweary you. Here I exchanged some of my diamonds for merchandise. From\r\nhere we went to other islands, and at last, having touched at several\r\ntrading towns of the continent, we landed at Bussorah, and from there\r\nI proceeded to Baghdad. There I gave presents to the poor, and lived\r\nhonorably upon the vast riches I had gained with so many terrible\r\nhardships and so many great perils. Thus Sindbad ended the story of\r\nthe second voyage, gave Hindbad another hundred sequins, and invited\r\nhim to come the next day to hear more of his adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SAILOR\r\n\r\nOn the third day the porter again repaired to the house in which he\r\nhad heard such wonderful tales. After the dinner was finished, the\r\nhost began once more to tell of his travels.\r\n\r\nI soon grew weary of a life of idleness and embarked with some\r\nmerchants on another long voyage. One day we were overtaken by a\r\nstorm, which drove us out of our course, and we were obliged to cast\r\nanchor near an island. As soon as we landed, we were surrounded by\r\nsavage dwarfs, who took possession of our ship and sailed away. Left\r\nwithout means of escape from the island, we determined to explore it,\r\nin hope of finding food and shelter.\r\n\r\nWe had not advanced far, however, when we discovered that this island\r\nwas inhabited by giants, more savage than the dwarfs who had first\r\nattacked us. We knew that we could not remain on the island, and so we\r\nwent back to the shore and planned how we might escape.\r\n\r\nWhen night came, we made rafts, each large enough to carry three men,\r\nand as soon as it was light we put to sea with all the speed we could.\r\nThe giants saw us as we pushed out and, rushing down to the water\'s\r\nedge, threw great stones, which sank all the rafts except the one upon\r\nwhich I was.\r\n\r\nAll that day and night we were tossed by the waves, but the next\r\nmorning we were thrown upon an island, where we found delicious fruit\r\nwhich satisfied our hunger. Beautiful as this island was, we found\r\nourselves in danger as great as any we had escaped. My two companions\r\nwere killed by serpents, and I was almost in despair, when I saw a\r\nship in the distance. By shouting and waving my turban I attracted the\r\nattention of the crew, and a boat was sent for me.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I saw the captain, I knew him to be the man who, in my\r\nsecond voyage, had left me on the island. "Captain," said I, "I am\r\nSindbad, whom you left on the island."\r\n\r\n"Heaven be praised," said the captain; "I am glad that my careless act\r\ndid not cause your death. These are your goods, which I always took\r\ncare to preserve."\r\n\r\nWe continued at sea for some time and touched at many islands, where I\r\ntraded for cloves, cinnamon, and other spices. At last I returned to\r\nBaghdad with so much wealth that I knew not its value. I gave a great\r\ndeal to the poor and bought another estate.\r\n\r\nThus Sindbad finished the story of his third voyage. He gave another\r\nhundred sequins to Hindbad and invited him to dinner the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SAILOR\r\n\r\nAfter dinner on the fourth day the merchant once more began to tell of\r\nhis adventures.\r\n\r\nAfter I had rested from the dangers of my third voyage, my love for\r\ntrade and adventure again took hold of me. I provided a stock of goods\r\nand started on another voyage. We had sailed a great way, when we were\r\novertaken by a storm, and the ship was wrecked. I clung to a plank and\r\nwas carried by the current to an island; here I found fruit and spring\r\nwater, which saved my life. The next day I started to explore the\r\nisland and, seeing some huts, I went toward them. The people who lived\r\nin these huts were savages, and they took me prisoner. I was in such\r\nfear of them that I could not eat, and at last I became sick.\r\n\r\nAfter that they did not watch me so closely, and I found a chance to\r\nescape. I traveled seven days, living upon coconuts, which served me\r\nfor food and drink. On the eighth day I met some people gathering\r\npepper, and I told them my story. They treated me with great kindness\r\nand took me with them when they sailed home.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in their own country they presented me to their King, who\r\ncommanded his people to take care of me, and soon I was looked upon\r\nas a native rather than a stranger. I was not, however, satisfied\r\nto remain away from my own home and planned to escape and return to\r\nBaghdad.\r\n\r\nOne day I saw a ship approaching the place where I was. I called\r\nto the crew, and they quickly sent a boat and took me on board. We\r\nstopped at several islands and collected great stores of costly goods.\r\nAfter we had finished our traffic, we put to sea again and at last\r\narrived at Baghdad. I gave large sums to the poor and enjoyed myself\r\nwith my friends in feasts and amusements.\r\n\r\nHere Sindbad made a present of one hundred sequins to Hindbad, whom he\r\nrequested to return the next day to dine with him and hear the story\r\nof his fifth voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SAILOR\r\n\r\nThe story of the fifth day was as follows:\r\n\r\nAll the misfortunes I had undergone could not cure me of my desire to\r\nmake new voyages. I therefore had a ship built and, taking with me\r\nseveral merchants, I started on my fifth voyage.\r\n\r\nWe touched at a desert island, where we found a roc\'s egg. We could\r\nsee that the young bird had begun to break the shell with his beak.\r\nThe merchants who were with me broke the shell with hatchets and\r\nkilled the young roc. Scarcely had they done this when the parent\r\nbirds flew down with a frightful noise. We hurried to the ship and set\r\nsail as speedily as possible. But the great birds followed us, each\r\ncarrying a rock between its claws. When they came directly over our\r\nship, they let the rocks fall, and the ship was crushed and most of\r\nthe passengers killed. I caught hold of a piece of the wreck and swam\r\nto an island. Here I found fruit and streams of fresh, pure water.\r\nAfter resting and eating some of the fruit, I determined to find out\r\nwho lived upon the island.\r\n\r\nI had not walked far, when I saw an old man sitting on the bank of a\r\nstream. He made signs to me to carry him over the brook, and as he\r\nseemed very weak, I took him upon my back and carried him across. When\r\nwe reached the other side, the old man threw his legs around my neck\r\nand squeezed my throat until I fainted. But he kept his seat and\r\nkicked me to make me stand up. He made me carry him all that day, and\r\nat night lay down with me, still holding fast to my neck.\r\n\r\nThis continued for some time, and I grew weaker every day. One day,\r\nfeeling sure that I could not escape, he began to laugh and sing and\r\nmove around on my back. This was my opportunity, and, using all my\r\nstrength, I threw him to the ground, where he lay motionless.\r\n\r\nFeeling very thankful at my escape, I went down to the beach and saw a\r\nship at anchor there. The crew were very much surprised when I told my\r\nadventure. "You are the first," they said, "who ever escaped from the\r\nold man of the sea after falling into his power."\r\n\r\nWe soon put out to sea and after a few days arrived at a great city.\r\nOne of the merchants invited me to go with him and others to gather\r\ncoconuts. The trunks of the coconut trees were lofty and very smooth,\r\nand I saw many apes among the branches. It was not possible to climb\r\nthe trees, but the merchants, by throwing stones, provoked the apes\r\nto throw the coconuts at us, and by this trick we collected enough\r\ncoconuts to load our ship.\r\n\r\nWe then set sail and touched at other islands, where I exchanged\r\nmy coconuts for pepper and wood of aloes. I also hired divers, who\r\nbrought me up pearls that were very large and perfect. When I returned\r\nto Baghdad, I made vast sums from my pepper, precious woods, and\r\npearls. I gave the tenth of my gains to charity, as I had done on my\r\nreturn from other voyages.\r\n\r\nSindbad here ordered one hundred sequins to be given to Hindbad and\r\nrequested him to dine with him the next day to hear the account of his\r\nnext voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SAILOR\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was finished on the sixth day, Sindbad spoke as follows:\r\n\r\nAfter a year\'s rest I prepared for a sixth voyage, notwithstanding the\r\nentreaties of my friends, who did all in their power to keep me at\r\nhome. I traveled through several provinces of Persia and the Indies,\r\nand then embarked on a long voyage, in the course of which the ship\r\nwas carried by a rapid current to the foot of a high mountain, where\r\nshe struck and went to pieces.\r\n\r\nWe managed to save most of our provisions and our goods, but it was\r\nimpossible to climb the mountain or to escape by the sea. We were\r\nobliged to remain upon the strip of shore between the mountain and the\r\nsea. At last our provisions were exhausted, and my companions died,\r\none after the other. Then I determined to try once more to find a way\r\nof escape.\r\n\r\nA river ran from the sea into a dark cavern under an archway of rock.\r\nI said to myself, "If I make a raft and float with the current, it\r\nwill doubtless carry me to some inhabited country." I made a very\r\nsolid raft and loaded it with bales of rich goods from the wreck,\r\nand rubies, emeralds, and other precious stones which covered the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I entered the cavern, I found myself in darkness and I\r\nfloated on, I knew not where. I must have fallen asleep, for when I\r\nopened my eyes I was on the bank of a river, and a great many people\r\nwere around me. They spoke to me, but I did not understand their\r\nlanguage. I was so full of joy at my escape from death that I said\r\naloud in Arabic, "Close thine eyes, and while thou art asleep, Heaven\r\nwill change thy evil fortune into good fortune."\r\n\r\nOne of the men, who understood Arabic, said, "Brother, we are\r\ninhabitants of this country and water our fields from this river. We\r\nsaw your raft, and one of us swam out and brought it here. Pray tell\r\nus your history." After they had given me food, I told them my story,\r\nand then they took me to their King. I told the King my adventures;\r\nand when my raft was brought in, I showed him my rich goods and\r\nprecious stones. I saw that my jewels pleased him, and I said, "Sire,\r\nI am at your Majesty\'s service, and all that I have is yours." He\r\nanswered, with a smile, "Sindbad, I will take nothing from you; far\r\nfrom lessening your wealth, I mean to increase it."\r\n\r\nI prayed the King to allow me to return to my own country, and he\r\ngranted me permission in the most honorable manner. He gave me a rich\r\npresent and a letter for the Commander of the Faithful, our sovereign,\r\nsaying to me, "I pray you, give this present and this letter to the\r\nCaliph Harun-al-Rashid."\r\n\r\nThe letter was written on the skin of a certain animal of great value,\r\nvery scarce, and of a yellowish color. The characters of this letter\r\nwere of azure, and the contents as follows:\r\n\r\n"The King of the Indies, before whom march one hundred elephants, who\r\nlives in a palace that shines with one hundred thousand rubies, and\r\nwho has in his treasury twenty thousand crowns enriched with diamonds,\r\nto Caliph Harun-al-Rashid "Though the present we send you be small,\r\nreceive it, however, as a brother and a friend, in consideration of\r\nthe hearty friendship which we bear for you, and of which we are\r\nwilling to give you proof. We send you this letter as from one brother\r\nto another. Farewell."\r\n\r\nThe present consisted of one single ruby made into a cup, about half\r\na foot high and an inch thick, filled with round pearls large and\r\nbeautiful; the skin of a serpent, whose scales were as bright as an\r\nordinary piece of gold, and had the power to preserve from sickness\r\nthose who lay upon it; quantities of the best wood of aloes and\r\ncamphor; and, lastly, a wonderful robe covered with jewels of great\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe ship set sail, and after a successful voyage we landed at\r\nBussorah, and from there I went to the city of Baghdad, where the\r\nfirst thing I did was to go to the palace of the Caliph.\r\n\r\nTaking the King\'s letter, I presented myself at the gate of the\r\nCommander of the Faithful and was conducted to the throne of the\r\nCaliph. I presented the letter and gift. When he had finished reading,\r\nhe asked me if that ruler were really as rich as he represented\r\nhimself in his letter.\r\n\r\nI said, "Commander of the Faithful, I can assure your Majesty he does\r\nnot stretch the truth. I bear him witness. Nothing is more worthy of\r\nadmiration than the splendor of his palace. When the King appears in\r\npublic, he has a throne fixed on the back of an elephant, and rides\r\nbetwixt two ranks of his ministers and favorites, and other people of\r\nhis court. Before him, upon the same elephant, an officer carries a\r\ngolden lance in his hand, and behind him there is another who strands\r\nwith a rod of gold, on the top of which is an emerald half a foot long\r\nand an inch thick. "He is attended by one thousand men, clad in cloth\r\nof gold, and mounted on elephants richly decked. The officer who is\r\nbefore him cries from time to time, in a loud voice, \'Behold the great\r\nmonarch, the powerful Sultan of the Indies, the monarch greater than\r\nSolomon and the powerful Maharaja. After he has pronounced these\r\nwords, the officer behind the throne cries in his turn, \'This monarch,\r\nso great and so powerful, must die, must die, must die.\' And the\r\nofficer before replies, \'Praise be to Him alone who liveth forever and\r\never.\'"\r\n\r\nThe Caliph was much pleased with my account, and sent me home with a\r\nrich present.\r\n\r\nHere Sindbad commanded another hundred sequins to be paid to Hindbad,\r\nand begged his return on the morrow to hear of his last voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SAILOR\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day, after dinner, Sindbad told the story of his last\r\nvoyage:\r\n\r\nOn my return home from my sixth voyage, I had entirely given up all\r\nthoughts of again going to sea; for, not only did my age now\r\nrequire rest, but I was resolved to run no more such risks as I had\r\nencountered, so that I thought of nothing but to pass the rest of my\r\ndays in peace.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, an officer of the Caliph inquired for me. "The\r\nCaliph," said he, "has sent me to tell you that he must speak with\r\nyou." I followed the officer to the palace, where, being presented to\r\nthe Caliph, I saluted him, throwing myself at his feet.\r\n\r\n"Sindbad," said he to me, "I stand in need of your service; you must\r\ncarry my answer and present to the King of the Indies."\r\n\r\nThis command of the Caliph was to me like a clap of thunder.\r\n"Commander of the Faithful," I replied, "I am ready to do whatever\r\nyour Majesty shall think fit to command; but I beg you most humbly to\r\nconsider what I have undergone. I have also made a vow never to leave\r\nBaghdad."\r\n\r\nThe Caliph insisted, and I finally told him that I was willing to\r\nobey. He was pleased, and gave me one thousand sequins for the\r\nexpenses of my journey.\r\n\r\nI prepared for my departure in a few days. As soon as the Caliph\'s\r\nletter and present were delivered to me, I went to Bussorah, where I\r\nembarked, and had a safe voyage. Having arrived at the capital of the\r\nIndies, I was shown to the palace with much pomp, when I prostrated\r\nmyself on the ground before the King.\r\n\r\n"Sindbad," said the King, "you are welcome; I have many times thought\r\nof you; I bless the day on which I see you once more." I thanked him\r\nfor his kindness, and delivered the gifts from my master.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph\'s present was a complete suit of cloth of gold, fifty robes\r\nof rich stuff, a hundred of white cloth, the finest of Cairo, Suez,\r\nand Alexandria; a vessel of agate, more broad than deep, an inch\r\nthick, and half a foot long, the bottom of which was carved to\r\nrepresent a man with one knee on the ground, who held a bow and arrow,\r\nready to discharge at a lion. He sent him also a rich tablet, which,\r\naccording to tradition, had belonged to the great Solomon.\r\n\r\nThe King of the Indies was highly gratified at the Caliph\'s mark of\r\nfriendship. A little time after this I asked leave to depart, and with\r\nmuch difficulty obtained it. The King, when he dismissed me, made me\r\na very splendid present. I embarked for Baghdad, but had not the good\r\nfortune to arrive there so speedily as I had hoped. Three or four days\r\nafter my departure we were attacked by pirates, who seized upon our\r\nship, because it was not a vessel of war. Some of the crew fought\r\nback, which cost them their lives. But myself and the rest, who were\r\nnot so rash, the pirates saved, and carried into a distant island,\r\nwhere they sold us.\r\n\r\nI fell into the hands of a rich merchant, who, as soon as he bought\r\nme, took me to his house, treated me well, and clad me handsomely as\r\na slave. Some days after, he asked me if I understood any trade. I\r\nanswered that I was no mechanic, but a merchant, and that the pirates\r\nwho sold me had robbed me of all I had.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," he said, "can you shoot with a bow?" I answered that the\r\nbow was one of my exercises in my youth.\r\n\r\nThen my master told me to climb into a tree and shoot at the elephants\r\nas they passed and let him know as soon as I killed one, in order that\r\nhe might get the tusks. I hid as he told me, and as I was successful\r\nthe first day, he sent me day after day, for two months.\r\n\r\nOne morning the elephants surrounded my tree, and the largest pulled\r\nup the tree with his trunk and threw it on the ground. Then, picking\r\nme up, he laid me on his back and carried me to a hill almost covered\r\nwith the bones and tusks of elephants. I knew that this must be the\r\nburial place of the elephants and they had brought me here to show me\r\nthat I could get vast quantities of ivory without killing any more\r\nelephants.\r\n\r\nI went back to the city and told my master all that had happened.\r\nHe was overjoyed at my escape from death and the riches which I had\r\nobtained for him. As a reward for my services he set me free and\r\npromised to send me home as soon as the trade winds brought the ships\r\nfor ivory.\r\n\r\nA ship arrived at last, and my master loaded one half of it with ivory\r\nfor me. When we reached a port on the mainland, I landed my ivory and\r\nset out for home with a caravan of merchants. I was a long time on the\r\njourney, but was happy in thinking that I had nothing to fear from\r\nthe sea or from pirates. At last I arrived at Baghdad, and the Caliph\r\nloaded me with honors and rich presents.\r\n\r\nSindbad here finished the story of his seventh and last voyage. Then\r\naddressing himself to Hindbad, he said, "Well, friend, did you ever\r\nhear of any person who had suffered as much as I have?"\r\n\r\nHindbad kissed Sindbad\'s hand and said, "Sir, my afflictions are not\r\nto be compared with yours. You not only deserve a quiet life, but are\r\nworthy of all the riches you possess. May you live happily for a long\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nSindbad ordered him to be paid another hundred sequins and told him to\r\ngive up carrying burdens and to eat henceforth at his table, for he\r\nwished him to remember that he would always have a friend in Sindbad\r\nthe Sailor.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

Pilgrims going to some holy shrine passed along, merchants\r\ntaking their wares to Court, Abbots and Bishops ambling by on palfreys\r\nto bear their part in the King\'s Council, and, more frequently still,\r\na solitary Knight, seeking adventures.\r\n\r\nBesides the broad roads there were small tracks and little green\r\npaths, and these led to clumps of low huts, where dwelt the peasants,\r\ncharcoal-burners, and plowmen, while here and there some larger\r\nclearing than usual told that the house of a yeoman was near.\r\n\r\nNow and then as you passed through the forest you might ride by a\r\nsplendid abbey, and catch a glimpse of monks in long black or white\r\ngowns, fishing in the streams and rivers that abound in this part of\r\nEngland, or casting nets in the fish ponds which were in the midst\r\nof the abbey gardens. Or you might chance to see a castle with round\r\nturrets and high battlements, circled by strong walls, and protected\r\nby a moat full of water.\r\n\r\nThis was the sort of England into which the famous Robin Hood was\r\nborn. We know very little about him, who he was, or where he lived,\r\nexcept that for some reason he had offended the King, who had declared\r\nhim an outlaw, so that any man might kill him and never pay a penalty\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nBut, outlaw or not, the poor people loved him and looked on him as\r\ntheir friend, and many a stout fellow came to join him, and led a\r\nmerry life in the greenwood, with moss and fern for bed, and for meat\r\nthe King\'s deer, which it was death to slay.\r\n\r\nPeasants of all sorts, tillers of the land, yeomen, and, as some say,\r\nKnights, went on their ways freely, for of them Robin took no toll;\r\nbut rich men with moneybags well filled trembled as they drew near to\r\nSherwood Forest--who was to know whether behind every tree there did\r\nnot lurk Robin Hood or some of his men?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF LITTLE JOHN\r\n\r\nOne day Robin was walking alone in the wood, and reached a river which\r\nwas spanned by a very narrow bridge, over which one man only could\r\npass. In the middle stood a stranger, and Robin bade him go back and\r\nlet him go over. "I am no man of yours," was all the answer Robin got,\r\nand in anger he drew his bow and fitted an arrow to it.\r\n\r\n"Would you shoot a man who has no arms but a staff?" asked the\r\nstranger in scorn; and with shame Robin laid down his bow, and\r\nunbuckled an oaken stick at his side. "We will fight till one of us\r\nfalls into the water," he said; and fight they did, till the stranger\r\nplanted a blow so well that Robin rolled over into the river.\r\n\r\n"You are a brave soul," said he, when he had waded to land; and he\r\nblew a blast with his horn which brought fifty good fellows, clad in\r\ngreen, to the little bridge. "Have you fallen into the river, that\r\nyour clothes are wet?" asked one; and Robin made answer, "No, but this\r\nstranger, fighting on the bridge, got the better of me and tumbled me\r\ninto the stream."\r\n\r\nAt this the foresters seized the stranger and would have ducked him,\r\nhad not their leader bade them stop and begged the stranger to stay\r\nwith them and make one of themselves. "Here is my hand," replied the\r\nstranger, "and my heart with it. My name, if you would know it, is\r\nJohn Little."\r\n\r\n"That must be altered," cried Will Scarlett; "we will call a feast,\r\nand henceforth, because he is full seven feet tall and round the waist\r\nat least an ell, he shall be called Little John."\r\n\r\nAnd thus it was done; but at the feast Little John, who always liked\r\nto know exactly what work he had to do, put some questions to Robin\r\nHood. "Before I join hands with you, tell me first what sort of life\r\nthis is you lead. How am I to know whose goods I shall take, and\r\nwhose I shall leave? Whom shall I beat, and whom shall I refrain from\r\nbeating?"\r\n\r\nAnd Robin answered: "Look that you harm not any tiller of the ground,\r\nnor any yeoman of the greenwood--no, nor any knight or squire, unless\r\nyou have heard him ill spoken of. But if rich men with moneybags come\r\nyour way, see that you spoil THEM, and mark that you always hold in\r\nyour mind the High Sheriff of Nottingham."\r\n\r\nThis being settled, Robin Hood declared Little John to be second in\r\ncommand to himself among the brotherhood of the forest, and the\r\nnew outlaw never forgot to hold in his mind the High Sheriff of\r\nNottingham, who was the bitterest enemy the foresters had.\r\n\r\nRobin Hood, however, had no liking for a company of idle men about\r\nhim, so he at once sent off Little John and Will Scarlett to the great\r\nroad known as Wafting Street with orders to hide among the trees and\r\nwait till some adventure might come to them. If they took captive Earl\r\nor Baron, Abbot or Knight, he was to be brought unharmed back to Robin\r\nHood.\r\n\r\nBut all along Wafting Street the road was bare; white and hard it lay\r\nin the sun, without the tiniest cloud of dust to show that a rich\r\ncompany might be coming; east and west the land lay still.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE JOHN\'S FIRST ADVENTURE\r\n\r\nAt length, just where a side path turned into the broad highway, there\r\nrode a Knight, and a sorrier man than he never sat a horse on a summer\r\nday. One foot only was in the stirrup; the other hung carelessly by\r\nhis side. His head was bowed, the reins dropped loose, and his horse\r\nwent on as he would. At so sad a sight the hearts of the outlaws were\r\nfilled with pity, and Little John fell on his knees and bade the\r\nKnight welcome in the name of his master. "Who is your master?" asked\r\nthe Knight.\r\n\r\n"Robin Hood," answered Little John.\r\n\r\n"I have heard much good of him," replied the Knight, "and will go with\r\nyou gladly."\r\n\r\nThen they all set off together, tears running down the Knight\'s cheeks\r\nas he rode. But he said nothing; neither was anything said to him. And\r\nin this wise they came to Robin Hood.\r\n\r\n"Welcome, Sir Knight," cried he, "and thrice welcome, for I waited to\r\nbreak my fast till you or some other had come to me." "God save you,\r\ngood Robin," answered the Knight; and after they had washed themselves\r\nin the stream, they sat down to dine off bread and wine, with flesh of\r\nthe King\'s deer, and swans and pheasants. "Such a dinner have I not\r\nhad for three weeks and more," said the Knight.\r\n\r\n"And if I ever come again this way, good Robin, I will give you as\r\nfine a dinner as you have given me."\r\n\r\n"I thank you," replied Robin; "my dinner is always welcome; still, I\r\nam none so greedy but I can wait for it. But before you go, pay me, I\r\npray you, for the food which you have had. It was never the custom for\r\na yeoman to pay for a Knight."\r\n\r\n"My bag is empty," said the Knight, "save for ten shillings only."\r\n\r\n"Go, Little John, and look in his wallet," said Robin, "and, Sir\r\nKnight, if in truth you have no more, not one penny will I take; nay,\r\nI will give you all that you shall need."\r\n\r\nSo Little John spread out the Knight\'s mantle, and opened the bag, and\r\ntherein lay ten shillings and naught besides.\r\n\r\n"What tidings, Little John?" cried his master.\r\n\r\n"Sir, the Knight speaks truly," said Little John.\r\n\r\n"Then fill a cup of the best wine and tell me Sir Knight, whether it\r\nis your own ill doings which have brought you to this sorry pass."\r\n\r\n"For a hundred years my fathers have dwelt in the forest," answered\r\nthe Knight, "and four hundred pounds might they spend yearly. But\r\nwithin two years misfortune has befallen me, and my wife and children\r\nalso."\r\n\r\n"How did this evil come to pass?" asked Robin.\r\n\r\n"Through my own folly," answered the Knight, "and because of the great\r\nlove I bore my son, who would never be guided of my counsel, and slew,\r\nere he was twenty years old, a Knight of Lancaster and his squire. For\r\ntheir deaths I had to pay a large sum, which I could not raise without\r\ngiving my lands in pledge to a rich man at York. If I cannot give him\r\nthe money by a certain day, they will be lost to me forever."\r\n\r\n"What is the sum?" asked Robin. "Tell me truly."\r\n\r\n"It is four hundred pounds," said the Knight.\r\n\r\n"And what will you do if you lose your lands?" asked Robin again.\r\n\r\n"Hie myself over the sea," said the Knight, "and bid farewell to my\r\nfriends and country. There is no better way open to me."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, tears fell from his eyes, and he turned to depart.\r\n\r\n"Good day, my friend," he said to Robin; "I cannot pay you what I\r\nshould--" But Robin held him fast. "Where are your friends?" asked he.\r\n\r\n"Sir, they have all forsaken me, since I became poor, and they turn\r\naway their heads if we meet upon the road, though when I was rich they\r\nwere ever in my castle."\r\n\r\nWhen Little John and Will Scarlett and the rest heard this, they wept\r\nfor very shame and fury, and Robin bade them fill a cup of the best\r\nwine and give it to the Knight.\r\n\r\n"Have you no one who would stay surety for you?" said he.\r\n\r\n"None," answered the Knight; "there is no one who will stay surety for\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"You speak well," said Robin, "and you, Little John, go to my treasure\r\nchest, and bring me thence four hundred pounds. And be sure you count\r\nit truly."\r\n\r\nSo Little John went, and Will Scarlett, and they brought back the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Little John, when Robin had counted it and found it no\r\nmore and no less, "look at his clothes, how thin they are! You have\r\nstores of garments, green and scarlet, in your coffers--no merchant in\r\nEngland can boast the like. I will measure some out with my bow." And\r\nthus he did.\r\n\r\n"Master," spoke Little John again, "there is still something else. You\r\nmust give him a horse, that he may go as beseems his quality to York."\r\n\r\n"Take the gray horse," said Robin, "and put a new saddle on it, and\r\ntake likewise a good palfrey and a pair of boots, with gilt Spurs on\r\nthem. And as it would be a shame for a Knight to ride by himself on\r\nthis errand, I will lend you Little John as squire--perchance he may\r\nstand you in yeoman\'s stead."\r\n\r\n"When shall we meet again?" asked the Knight.\r\n\r\n"This day twelve months," said Robin, "under the greenwood tree."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHT WINS BACK HIS LANDS\r\n\r\nThen the Knight rode on his way, with Little John behind him, and as\r\nhe went he thought of Robin Hood and his men, and blessed them for the\r\ngoodness they had shown toward him.\r\n\r\n"Tomorrow," he said to Little John, "I must be in the city of York,\r\nfor if I am so much as a day late, my lands are lost forever; and\r\nthough I were to bring the money, I should not be allowed to redeem\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nNow the man who had lent the money, as well as the Knight, had been\r\ncounting the days, and the next day he said to his friends, "This\r\nday year there came a Knight and borrowed of me four hundred pounds,\r\ngiving his lands as surety. If he come not to pay his debt before\r\nmidnight, they will be mine forever."\r\n\r\n"It is full early yet," said one; "he may still be coming."\r\n\r\n"He is far beyond the sea and suffers from hunger and cold," said the\r\nrich man. "How is he to get here?"\r\n\r\n"It were a shame," said another, "for you to take his lands. And you\r\ndo him much wrong if you drive such a hard bargain."\r\n\r\n"He is dead or hanged," said a third, "and you will have his lands."\r\n\r\nSo they went to the High Justiciar, whose duty it would be to declare\r\nthe Knight\'s lands forfeited if he did not pay the money.\r\n\r\n"If he come not this day," cried the rich man, rubbing his hands, "the\r\nlands will be mine."\r\n\r\n"He will not come," said the Justiciar, but he knew not that the\r\nKnight was already at the outer gate, and Little John with him.\r\n\r\n"Welcome, Sir Knight," said the porter. "The horse that you ride is\r\nthe noblest that ever I saw. Let me lead it and the steed of your\r\ncompanion to the stable, that they may have food and rest."\r\n\r\n"They shall not pass these gates," answered the Knight sternly, and he\r\nentered the hall alone.\r\n\r\n"I have come back, my lord," he said, kneeling down before the rich\r\nman, who had just returned from court. "Have you brought my money?"\r\n\r\n"I have come to pray you to give me more time," said the Knight.\r\n\r\n"The day was fixed and cannot be gainsaid," answered the Justiciar,\r\nwho was sitting at meat with others in the hall.\r\n\r\nThe Knight begged the Justiciar to be his friend and help him, but he\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\n"Give me one more chance to get the money and free my lands," prayed\r\nthe Knight. "I will serve you day and night till I have four hundred\r\npounds to redeem them." But the rich man only vowed that the money\r\nmust be paid that day or the lands be forfeited.\r\n\r\nThen the Knight stood up straight and tall.\r\n\r\n"You are not courteous," he said, "to make a Knight kneel so long. But\r\nit is well to prove one\'s friends against the hour of need."\r\n\r\nThen he looked the rich man full in the face, and the man felt uneasy\r\nand hated the Knight more than ever. "Out of my hall, false Knight,"\r\nhe cried, pretending to a courage he did not feel.\r\n\r\nBut the Knight answered him, "Never was I false, and that I have shown\r\nin jousts and in tourneys."\r\n\r\n"Give him two hundred pounds more," said the Justiciar to the rich\r\nman, "and keep the lands yourself."\r\n\r\n"No," cried the Knight, "not if you offered me a thousand pounds would\r\nI do it. No one here shall be heir of mine." Then he strode up to a\r\ntable and emptied out four hundred pounds. "Take your gold which you\r\nlent to me a year agone," he said. "Had you but received me civilly, I\r\nwould have paid you something more."\r\n\r\nThen he passed out of the hall singing merrily and rode back to his\r\nhouse, where his wife met him at the gate.\r\n\r\nHe went forth full merrily singing, As men have told in tale; His lady\r\nmet him at the gate, At home in Wierysdale.\r\n\r\n"Welcome, my lord," said his lady; "Sir, lost is all your good." "Be\r\nmerry, dame," said the Knight, "And pray for Robin Hood."\r\n\r\nThen he told how Robin Hood had befriended him, and how he had\r\nredeemed his lands, and finished his tale by praising the outlaw. "But\r\nfor his kindness," he said, "we had been beggars."\r\n\r\nAfter this the Knight dwelt at home, looking after his lands and\r\nsaving his money carefully, till the four hundred pounds lay ready for\r\nRobin Hood. Then he bought a hundred bows and a hundred arrows, and\r\nevery arrow was an ell long, and had a head of silver and peacock\'s\r\nfeathers. And clothing himself in white and red, and with a hundred\r\nmen in his train, he set off to Sherwood Forest.\r\n\r\nOn the way he passed an open space near a bridge where there was a\r\nwrestling, and the Knight stopped and looked, for he himself had taken\r\nmany a prize in that sport. Here the prizes were such as to fill any\r\nman with envy: a fine horse, saddled and bridled, a great white bull,\r\na pair of gloves, and a ring of bright, red gold.\r\n\r\nThere was not a yeoman present who did not hope to win one of them.\r\nBut when the wrestling was over, the yeoman who had beaten them all\r\nwas a man who kept apart from his fellows and was said to think much\r\nof himself.\r\n\r\nTherefore the men grudged him his skill, and set upon him with blows,\r\nand would have killed him had not the Knight, for love of Robin Hood,\r\ntaken pity on him, while his followers fought with the crowd, and\r\nwould not suffer them to touch the prizes a better man had won.\r\n\r\nWhen the wrestling was finished, the Knight rode on, and there under\r\nthe greenwood tree, in the place appointed, he found Robin and his\r\nmerry men waiting for him, according to the tryst that they had fixed\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n    "God save thee, Robin Hood,\r\n    And all this company."\r\n    "Welcome be thou, gentle Knight,\r\n    And right welcome to me.\r\n\r\n    "Hast thou thy land again?" said Robin;\r\n    "Truth then tell thou me."\r\n    "Yea, \'fore God," said the Knight,\r\n    "And for it thank I God and thee.\r\n\r\n    "Have here four hundred pounds,\r\n    The which you lent to me;\r\n    And here are also twenty marks\r\n    For your courtesie."\r\n\r\nBut Robin would not take the money. A miracle had happened, he said,\r\nand it had been paid to him, and shame would it be for him to take it\r\ntwice over.\r\n\r\nThen he noticed for the first time the bows and arrows which the\r\nKnight had brought, and asked what they were. "A poor present to you,"\r\nanswered the Knight; and Robin, who would not be outdone, sent Little\r\nJohn once more to his treasury, and bade him bring forth four hundred\r\npounds, which were given to the Knight.\r\n\r\nAfter that they parted, in much love; and Robin prayed the Knight if\r\nhe were in any strait to let him know at the greenwood tree, and while\r\nthere was any gold there he should have it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW LITTLE JOHN BECAME THE SHERIFF\'S SERVANT\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the High Sheriff of Nottingham proclaimed a great\r\nshooting-match in a broad open space, and Little John was minded to\r\ntry his skill with the rest. He rode through the forest, whistling\r\ngaily to himself, for well he knew that not one of Robin Hood\'s men\r\ncould send an arrow as straight as he, and he felt little fear of\r\nanyone else.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the trysting place, he found a large company\r\nassembled, the Sheriff with them, and the rules of the match were read\r\nout: where they were to stand, how far the mark was to be, and that\r\nthree tries should be given to every man.\r\n\r\nSome of the shooters shot near the mark; some of them even touched it;\r\nbut none but Little John split the slender wand of willow with every\r\narrow that flew from his bow.\r\n\r\nAt this sight the Sheriff of Nottingham swore that Little John was the\r\nbest archer that ever he had seen, and asked him who he was and where\r\nhe was born, and vowed that if he would enter his service he would\r\ngive twenty marks a year to so good a bowman.\r\n\r\nLittle John, who did not wish to confess that he was one of Robin\r\nHood\'s men and an outlaw, said his name was Reynold Greenleaf, and\r\nthat he was in the service of a Knight, whose leave he must get before\r\nhe became the servant of any man.\r\n\r\nThis was given heartily by the Knight whose lands had been saved by\r\nthe kindness of Robin Hood, and Little John bound himself to the\r\nSheriff for the space of twelve months, and was given a good white\r\nhorse to ride on whenever he went abroad. But for all that, he did not\r\nlike his bargain, and made up his mind to do the Sheriff, who was\r\nhated of the outlaws, all the mischief he could.\r\n\r\nHis chance came on a Wednesday, when the Sheriff always went hunting,\r\nand Little John lay in bed till noon, or till he grew hungry. Then he\r\ngot up and told the steward that he wanted some dinner. The steward\r\nanswered that he should have nothing till the Sheriff came home; so\r\nLittle John grumbled and left him, and sought out the butler.\r\n\r\nHere he was no more successful than before; the butler just went to\r\nthe buttery door and locked it, and told Little John that he would\r\nhave to make himself happy till his lord returned.\r\n\r\nRude words mattered nothing to Little John, who was not, accustomed to\r\nbe balked by trifles; so he gave a mighty kick, which burst open the\r\ndoor, and then ate and drank as much as he would, and when he had\r\nfinished all there was in the buttery, he went down into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nNow the Sheriff\'s cook was a strong man and a bold one, and had no\r\nmind to let another man play the king in his kitchen; so he gave\r\nLittle John three smart blows, which were returned heartily. "Thou art\r\na brave man and hardy," said Little John, "and a good fighter withal.\r\nI have a sword; take you another, and let us see which is the better\r\nman of us twain."\r\n\r\nThe cook did as he was bid, and for two hours they fought, neither of\r\nthem harming the other. "Fellow," said Little John at last, "you are\r\none of the best swordsmen that I ever saw--and if you could shoot as\r\nwell with the bow, I would take you back to the merry greenwood, and\r\nRobin Hood would give you twenty marks a year and two changes of\r\nclothing."\r\n\r\n"Put up your sword," said the cook, "and I will go with you. But first\r\nwe will have some food in my kitchen, and carry off a little of the\r\ngold and silver that is in the Sheriff\'s treasure house."\r\n\r\nThey ate and drank till they wanted no more, and they broke the locks\r\nof the treasure house, and took of the silver as much as they could\r\ncarry, and of the gold, three hundred pounds and more, and departed\r\nunseen by anyone to Robin in the forest.\r\n\r\n"Welcome! welcome!" cried Robin, when he saw them; "a welcome, too,\r\nto the fair yeoman you bring with you. What tidings from Nottingham,\r\nLittle John?"\r\n\r\n"The proud Sheriff greets you, and sends you by my hand his cook and\r\nhis silver vessels, and three hundred pounds and three also."\r\n\r\nRobin shook his head, for he knew better than to believe Little John\'s\r\ntale. "It was never by his good will that you brought such treasure to\r\nme," he answered; and Little John, fearing that he might be ordered to\r\ntake it back again, slipped away into the forest to carry out a plan\r\nthat had just come into his head.\r\n\r\nHe ran straight on for five miles, till he came up with the Sheriff,\r\nwho was still hunting, and flung himself on his knees before him.\r\n\r\n"Reynold Greenleaf," cried the Sheriff, "what are you doing here, and\r\nwhere have you been?"\r\n\r\n"I have been in the forest, where I saw a fair hart of a green color,\r\nand seven score deer feeding hard by."\r\n\r\n"That sight would I see too," said the Sheriff.\r\n\r\n"Then follow me," answered Little John, and he ran back the way he\r\ncame, the Sheriff following on horseback, till they turned a corner of\r\nthe forest, and found themselves in Robin Hood\'s presence. "Sir, here\r\nis the master hart," said Little John.\r\n\r\nStill stood the proud Sheriff; A sorry man was he. "Woe be to you,\r\nReynold Greenleaf; Thou hast betrayed me!"\r\n\r\n"It was not my fault," answered Little John, "but the fault of your\r\nservants, master; for they would not give me my dinner." So he went\r\naway to see to the supper.\r\n\r\nIt was spread under the greenwood tree, and they sat down to it,\r\nhungry men all. But when the Sheriff saw himself served from his own\r\ndishes, his appetite went from him.\r\n\r\n"Take heart, man," said Robin Hood, "and think not we will poison you.\r\nFor charity\'s sake, and for the love of Little John, your life shall\r\nbe granted you. Only for twelve months you shall dwell with me, and\r\nlearn what it is to be an outlaw."\r\n\r\nTo the Sheriff this punishment was worse to bear than the loss of\r\ngold, or silver dishes, and earnestly he begged Robin Hood to set him\r\nfree, vowing he would prove himself the best friend that ever the\r\nforesters had.\r\n\r\nNeither Robin nor any of his men believed him; but he swore that he\r\nwould never seek to do them harm, and that if he found any of them in\r\nevil plight he would deliver them out of it. With that Robin let him\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ROBIN MET FRIAR TUCK\r\n\r\nIn many ways life in the forest was dull in the winter, and often the\r\ndays passed slowly; but in summer, when the leaves were green, and\r\nflowers and ferns covered all the woodland, Robin Hood and his men\r\nwould come out of their warm resting places, like the rabbits and the\r\nsquirrels, and would play, too. Races they ran to stretch their legs,\r\nor leaping matches were arranged, or they would shoot at a mark.\r\nAnything was pleasant when the grass was soft once more under their\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n"Who of you can kill a hart five hundred paces off?" So said Robin to\r\nhis men one bright May morning; and they went into the wood and tried\r\ntheir skill, and in the end it was Little John who brought down the\r\nhart, to the great joy of Robin Hood.\r\n\r\n"I would ride my horse a hundred miles to find one who could match\r\nwith thee," he said to Little John; and Will Scarlett, who was perhaps\r\nrather jealous of this mighty deed, answered, with a laugh, "There\r\nlives a friar in Fountains Abbey who would beat both him and you."\r\n\r\nNow Robin Hood did not like to be told that any man could shoot better\r\nthan himself or his foresters; so he swore lustily that he would\r\nneither eat nor drink till he had seen that friar. Leaving his men\r\nwhere they were, he put on a coat of mail and a steel cap, took his\r\nshield and sword, slung his bow over his shoulder, and filled his\r\nquiver with arrows. Thus armed, he set forth to Fountains Dale.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the river a friar was walking, armed like Robin, but\r\nwithout a bow. At this sight Robin jumped from his horse, which he\r\ntied to a thorn, and called to the friar to carry him over the water,\r\nor it would cost him his life.\r\n\r\nThe friar said nothing, but hoisted Robin on his broad back and\r\nmarched into the river. Not a word was spoken till they reached the\r\nother side, when Robin leaped, lightly down, and was going on his way.\r\nThen the friar stopped him. "Not so fast, my fine fellow," said he.\r\n"It is my turn now, and you shall take me across the river, or woe\r\nwill betide you."\r\n\r\nSo Robin carried him, and when they had reached the side from which\r\nthey had started, he set down the friar and jumped for the second\r\ntime on his back, and bade him take him whence he had come. The friar\r\nstrode into the stream with his burden, but as soon as they got to the\r\nmiddle he bent his head, and Robin fell into the water. "Now you can\r\nsink or swim, as you like," said the friar, as he stood and laughed.\r\n\r\nRobin Hood swam to a bush of golden broom, and pulled himself out of\r\nthe water; and while the friar was scrambling out, Robin fitted an\r\narrow to his bow and let fly at him. But the friar quickly held up his\r\nshield, and the arrow fell harmless.\r\n\r\n"Shoot on, my fine fellow; shoot on all day if you like," shouted the\r\nfriar; and Robin shot till his arrows were gone, but always missed his\r\nmark. Then they took their swords, and at four of the afternoon they\r\nwere still fighting.\r\n\r\nBy this time Robin\'s strength was wearing, and he felt he could not\r\nfight much more. "A boon, a boon!" cried he. "Let me but blow three\r\nblasts on my horn, and I will thank you on my bended knees for it."\r\n\r\nThe friar told him to blow as many blasts as he liked, and in an\r\ninstant the forest echoed with his horn; it was but a few minutes\r\nbefore half a hundred yeomen were racing over the lea. The friar\r\nstared when he saw them; then, turning to Robin, he begged of him a\r\nboon also; and leave being granted, he gave three whistles, which were\r\nfollowed by the noise of a great crashing through the trees, as fifty\r\ngreat dogs bounded toward him.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a dog for each of your men," said the friar, "and I myself for\r\nyou"; but the dogs did not listen to his words, for two of them rushed\r\nat Robin and tore his mantle of Lincoln green from off his back. His\r\nmen were kept busy defending themselves, for every arrow shot at a dog\r\nwas caught and held in the creature\'s mouth.\r\n\r\nRobin\'s men were not used to fight with dogs, and felt they were\r\ngetting beaten. At last Little John bade the friar call off his dogs,\r\nand as he did not do so, he let fly some arrows, which this time left\r\nhalf a dozen dead on the ground.\r\n\r\n"Hold, hold, my good fellow," said the friar, "till your master and I\r\ncan come to a bargain"; and when the bargain was made, this was how\r\nit ran: that the friar was to forswear Fountains Abbey and join\r\nRobin Hood, and that he should be paid a golden noble every Sunday\r\nthroughout the year, besides a change of clothes on each holy day.\r\n\r\nThis Friar had kept Fountains Dale Seven long years or more; There was\r\nneither Knight, nor Lord, nor Earl Could make him yield before.\r\n\r\nBut now he became one of the most famous members of Robin Hood\'s men\r\nunder the name of Friar Tuck.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ROBIN HOOD AND LITTLE JOHN FELL OUT\r\n\r\nOne Whitsunday morning, when the sun was shining and the birds\r\nsinging, Robin Hood called to Little John to come with him into\r\nNottingham to church. As was their custom, they took their bows, and\r\non the way Little John proposed that they should shoot a match, with a\r\npenny for a wager.\r\n\r\nRobin, who held that he shot better than any Other man living, laughed\r\nin scorn, and told Little John that he should have three tries to his\r\nmaster\'s one, which John without more ado accepted.\r\n\r\nBut Robin soon repented both of his offer and his scorn, for Little\r\nJohn speedily won five shillings, whereat Robin became angry and smote\r\nLittle John with his hand. Little John was not the man to bear being\r\ntreated so, and he told Robin roundly that he would never more own him\r\nfor master, and straightway turned back into the wood.\r\n\r\nAt this, Robin was ashamed of what he had done, but his pride would\r\nnot suffer him to say so; and he continued his way to Nottingham, and\r\nentered the Church of St. Mary, not without secret fears, for the\r\nSheriff of the town was ever his enemy. However, there he was, and\r\nthere he meant to stay.\r\n\r\nHe knelt down in the sight of all the people; but none knew him save\r\none man only, and he stole out of church and ran to the Sheriff and\r\nbade him come quickly and take his foe.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff was not slow to do what he was bidden, and, calling his\r\nmen to follow him, he marched to the church. The noise they made in\r\nentering caused Robin to look round. "Alas, alas," he said to himself,\r\n"now miss I Little John."\r\n\r\nBut he drew his two-handed sword and laid about him in such wise that\r\ntwelve of the Sheriff\'s men lay dead before him. Then Robin found\r\nhimself face to face with the Sheriff, and gave him a fierce blow; but\r\nhis sword broke on the Sheriff\'s head, and he had shot away all his\r\narrows. So the men closed round him and bound his arms.\r\n\r\nIll news travels fast, and not many hours had passed before the\r\nforesters heard that their master was in prison. They wept and moaned\r\nand wrung their hands, and seemed to have gone suddenly mad, till\r\nLittle John bade them pluck up their hearts and help him deal with the\r\nSheriff.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Little John hid himself and waited with a comrade\r\ntill he saw a messenger riding along the road, carrying letters from\r\nthe Sheriff to the King, telling him of the capture of Robin Hood.\r\n\r\n"Whence come you?" asked Little John, going up to the messenger, "and\r\ncan you give us tidings of an outlaw named Robin Hood, who was taken\r\nprisoner yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"You may thank me that he is taken," said the rider, "for I laid hands\r\non him."\r\n\r\n"I thank you so much that I and my friend will bear you company," said\r\nLittle John, "for in this forest are many wild men who own Robin Hood\r\nfor leader, and you ride along this road at the peril of your life."\r\n\r\nThey went on together, talking the while, when suddenly Little John\r\nseized the horse by the head and pulled down the rider.\r\n\r\n"He was my master," said Little John, "That you have brought to bale;\r\nNever shall you come at the King For to tell him that tale."\r\n\r\nThen taking the letters, Little John carried them to the King.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the palace in the presence of the King, Little\r\nJohn and his companion fell on their knees and held out the letters.\r\n"God save you, my liege lord," they said, and the King unfolded the\r\nletters and read them.\r\n\r\nThen he handed his own seal to Little John and ordered him to bear it\r\nto the Sheriff and bid him without delay bring Robin Hood unhurt into\r\nhis presence. "There never was yeoman in Merry England that I longed\r\nso sore to see," he said.\r\n\r\nThe King also ordered his treasurer to give the messengers twenty\r\npounds each, and made them yeomen of the crown.\r\n\r\nLittle John took the King\'s seal to the Sheriff, who made him and his\r\ncompanion welcome because they came from the King. He set a feast for\r\nthem, and after he had eaten he fell asleep. Then the two outlaws\r\nstole softly to the prison. They overpowered the guard and, taking the\r\nkeys, hunted through the cells until they found Robin Hood. Little\r\nJohn whispered to his master to follow him, and they crept along till\r\nthey reached the lowest part of the city wall, from which they jumped\r\nand were safe and free.\r\n\r\n"Now, farewell," said Little John; "I have done you a good turn for an\r\nill." "Not so," answered Robin Hood; "I make you master of my men and\r\nme." But Little John would hear nothing of it. "I only wish to be your\r\ncomrade, and thus it shall be," he replied.\r\n\r\n"Little John has beguiled us both," said the King, when he heard of\r\nthe adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE KING VISITED ROBIN HOOD\r\n\r\nNow the King had no mind that Robin Hood should do as he willed, and\r\ncalled his Knights to follow him to Nottingham, where they would lay\r\nplans how best to take captive the outlaw. Here they heard sad tales\r\nof Robin\'s misdoings, and how of the many herds of wild deer that had\r\nroamed the forest, in some places scarce one deer remained. This was\r\nthe work of Robin Hood and his merry men, on whom the King swore\r\nvengeance with a great oath.\r\n\r\n"I would I had this Robin Hood in my hands," cried he, "and an end\r\nshould soon be put to his doings." So spake the King; but an old\r\nKnight, full of days and wisdom, answered him and warned him that the\r\ntask of taking Robin Hood would be a sore one, and best let alone. The\r\nKing, who had seen the vanity of his hot words the moment that he had\r\nuttered them, listened to the old man and resolved to bide his time\r\nuntil perchance some day Robin should fall into his power.\r\n\r\nAll this time, and for six weeks later that he dwelt in Nottingham,\r\nthe King could hear nothing of Robin, who seemed to have vanished\r\ninto the earth with his merry men, though one by one the deer were\r\nvanishing, too. At last one day a forester came to the King and told\r\nhim that if he would see Robin he must come with him and take five of\r\nhis best Knights. The King eagerly sprang up to do his bidding, and\r\nthe six men, clad in monks\' clothes, mounted their palfreys and rode\r\nmerrily along, the King wearing an Abbot\'s broad hat over his crown,\r\nand singing as he passed through the greenwood. Suddenly at the turn\r\nof a path Robin and his archers appeared before them.\r\n\r\n"By your leave, Sir Abbot," said Robin, seizing the King\'s bridle,\r\n"you will stay a while with us. Know that we are yeomen, who live upon\r\nthe King\'s deer, and other food have we none. Now you have abbeys and\r\nchurches, and gold in plenty; therefore give us some of it, in the\r\nname of holy charity."\r\n\r\n"I have no more than forty pounds with me," answered the King, "but\r\nsorry I am it is not a hundred, for you should have it all."\r\n\r\nSo Robin took the forty pounds, and gave half to his men, and then\r\ntold the King he might go on his way. "I thank you," said the King,\r\n"but I would have you know that our liege lord has bid me bear you his\r\nseal and pray you to come to Nottingham."\r\n\r\nAt this message Robin bent his knee.\r\n\r\n    "I love no man in all the world\r\n    So well as I do my King,"\r\n\r\nhe cried, "and Sir Abbot, for thy tidings, which fill my heart with\r\njoy, today thou shalt dine with me, for love of my King."\r\n\r\nThen he led the King into an open place, and Robin took a horn and\r\nblew it loud, and at its blast seven score of young men came speedily\r\nto do his will.\r\n\r\n"They are quicker to do his bidding than my men are to do mine," said\r\nthe King to himself.\r\n\r\nSpeedily the foresters set out the dinner, roasts of venison and\r\nloaves of white bread, and Robin and Little John served the King.\r\n"Make good cheer," said Robin, "Abbot, for charity, and then you shall\r\nsee what sort of life we lead, so that you may tell our King."\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished eating, the archers took their bows and hung\r\nrose-garlands up with a string, and every man was to shoot through the\r\ngarland. If he failed, he should have a buffet on the head from Robin.\r\n\r\nGood bowmen as they were, few managed to stand the test. Little John\r\nand Will Scarlett and Much all shot wide of the mark, and at length no\r\none was left in but Robin himself and Gilbert of the Wide Hand. Then\r\nRobin fired his last bolt, and it fell three fingers from the garland.\r\n"Master," said Gilbert, "you have lost; stand forth and take your\r\npunishment, as was agreed."\r\n\r\n"I will take it," answered Robin, "but, Sir Abbot, I pray you that I\r\nmay suffer it at your hands."\r\n\r\nThe King hesitated. "It does not become me," he said, "to smite such\r\na stout yeoman"; but Robin bade him smite on and spare him not; so he\r\nturned up his sleeve, and gave Robin such a lusty buffet on the head\r\nthat he lost his feet and rolled upon the ground.\r\n\r\n"There is pith in your arm," said Robin. "Come, shoot a main with me."\r\nAnd the King took up a bow, and in so doing his hat fell back, and\r\nRobin saw his face.\r\n\r\n"My lord the King of England, now I know you well," cried he; and he\r\nfell on his knees, and all the outlaws with him. "Mercy I ask, my lord\r\nthe King, for all my brave foresters and me."\r\n\r\n"Mercy I grant," then said the King; "and therefore I came hither, to\r\nbid you and your men leave the greenwood and dwell in my Court with\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"So shall it be," answered Robin; "I and my men will come to your\r\nCourt, and see how your service liketh us."\r\n\r\n\r\nROBIN AT COURT\r\n\r\n"Have you any green cloth," asked the King, "that you could sell to\r\nme?" and Robin brought out thirty yards and more, and clad the King\r\nand his men in coats of Lincoln green. "Now we will all ride to\r\nNottingham," said he, and they went merrily, shooting by the way.\r\n\r\nThe people of Nottingham saw them coming and trembled as they watched\r\nthe dark mass of Lincoln green drawing near over the fields. "I fear\r\nlest our King be slain," whispered one to another; "and if Robin Hood\r\ngets into the town, there is not one of us whose life is safe"; and\r\nevery man, woman, and child made ready to flee.\r\n\r\nThe King laughed out when he saw their fright, and called them back.\r\nRight glad were they to hear his voice, and they feasted and made\r\nmerry. A few days later the King returned to London, and Robin dwelt\r\nin his Court for twelve months. By that time he had spent a hundred\r\npounds, for he gave largely to the Knights and squires he met, and\r\ngreat renown he had for his open-handedness. But his men, who had been\r\nborn under the shadow of the forest, could not live amid streets and\r\nhouses. One by one they slipped away, till only Little John and Will\r\nScarlett were left. Then Robin himself grew homesick, and at the\r\nsight of some young men shooting he thought upon the time when he was\r\naccounted the best archer in all England, and went straightway to the\r\nKing and begged for leave to go on a pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n"I may not say you nay," answered the King; "seven nights you may be\r\ngone and no more." And Robin thanked him, and that evening set out for\r\nthe greenwood. It was early morning when he reached it at last, and\r\nlistened thirstily to the notes of singing birds, great and small.\r\n\r\n"It seems long since I was here," he said to himself; "it would give\r\nme great joy if I could bring down a deer once more"; and he shot a\r\ngreat hart, and blew his horn, and all the outlaws of the forest came\r\nflocking round him. "Welcome," they said, "our dear master, back to\r\nthe greenwood tree"; and they threw off their caps and fell on their\r\nknees before him in delight at his return.\r\n\r\nNaught that the King could say would tempt Robin Hood back again, and\r\nhe dwelt in the greenwood for two and twenty years after he had run\r\naway from Court. And he was ever a faithful friend, kind to the poor,\r\nand gentle to all women.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nHistorical Note. When William the Conqueror became King of England he\r\ndestroyed many villages and towns to make royal forests in which he\r\nmight enjoy his favorite sport of hunting. The most famous of the\r\nhunting grounds was in Hampshire and was called the New Forest.\r\nHundreds of poor people were driven from their homes and left\r\nshelterless that this hunting park might be made. In order to keep up\r\nthese hunting grounds, William and the Kings who followed him made\r\nvery severe laws for the protection of the deer. The temptation to\r\nshoot these deer must have been very strong, especially to men living\r\nnear the forest, for the English at that time excelled all other\r\nnations in the use of the long bow. In consequence of this, many men\r\nkilled the King\'s deer, and fled to the woods to escape punishment.\r\nThere they formed into bands and, knowing the forests so well, were\r\nsafe from the King\'s officers. Among these outlaws were many brave and\r\nskillful archers, but none was ever more famous than the hero of this\r\nstory, Robin Hood.\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

I went\r\nto college at Cambridge, where I studied hard, for I knew my father\r\nwas not rich enough to keep me when I should become a man, and that I\r\nmust be able to earn my own living.\r\n\r\nI decided to be a doctor, but as I had always longed to travel, I\r\nlearned to be a good sailor as well. When I had succeeded in becoming\r\nboth doctor and sailor, I married, and with my wife\'s consent I became\r\nsurgeon upon a ship and made many voyages. One of these voyages was\r\nwith Captain Prichard, master of a vessel called the Antelope, bound\r\nfor the South Sea. We set sail from Bristol and started upon our\r\njourney very fairly, until there came a violent storm that drove our\r\nship near an island called Van Diemen\'s Land. The Antelope was driven\r\nagainst a rock, which wrecked and split the vessel in half.\r\n\r\nSix of the sailors and myself let down one of the small boats, and,\r\ngetting into it, rowed away from the ruined vessel and the dangerous\r\nrock. We rowed until we were so tired we could no longer hold the\r\noars; then we were obliged to allow our boat to go as the waves\r\ncarried it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came another violent gust of wind from the north, and\r\nour small boat was at once overturned. I do not know what became of my\r\nunfortunate companions, but I fear all must have been drowned. I was\r\na good swimmer, and I swam for my life. I went the best way I could,\r\npushed forward by wind and tide. Sometimes I let my legs drop to see\r\nif my feet touched the bottom, and when I was almost overcome and\r\nfainting, I found to my great joy that I was out of the deep water and\r\nable to walk.\r\n\r\nBy this time the storm was over. I walked about a mile, until I\r\nreached the shore, and when I stood upon land I could not see a sign\r\nof any houses or people. I felt very weak and tired; so I lay down\r\nupon the grass, which was very short and soft; and soon fell into a\r\nsound sleep.\r\n\r\nI must have slept all that night, for when I awoke, it was bright\r\ndaylight. I tried to rise, but found I was not able even to move.\r\nI had been lying upon my back, and I found my arms and legs were\r\nstrongly fastened on each side to the ground; and that my hair, which\r\nwas long and thick, was also tied to the ground. I felt several\r\nslender threads over my body. Fastened in this way, I could only look\r\nupwards, and, as the sun came out and shone in my eyes, this was very\r\nuncomfortable. I heard a queer noise about me, but could see nothing\r\nexcept the sky.\r\n\r\nIn a little while I felt something alive moving on my left leg; this\r\nthing came gently forward over my breast and almost up to my chin.\r\nBending my eyes downward as much as I could, I saw a tiny human\r\ncreature, not more than six inches high, with a tiny bow and arrow in\r\nhis hands. While I gazed in astonishment, forty more of the same kind\r\nfollowed the first. I called out so loud in my amazement that they all\r\nran back in a fright, and I felt them leaping from my sides to the\r\nground. However, they soon returned, and one of them came up so far\r\nas to get a full sight of my face. As he looked at me, he held up his\r\nhands and cried out in a shrill but distinct voice, "Hekinah degul!"\r\nOf course I did not understand what this meant, but from the tone in\r\nwhich it was said I thought it must express admiration for me.\r\n\r\nAll this time I lay in great uneasiness. At length I struggled to get\r\nloose, and managed to break the strings and pull up the pegs that\r\nfastened my left arm to the ground. Then with a violent tug that\r\ncaused me much pain I broke the strings that tied down my hair on the\r\nleft side, and was then able to turn my head a trifle.\r\n\r\nThe little people all ran off before I could seize them, and there\r\nwas a great deal of shouting in very shrill voices. Then in about an\r\ninstant I felt quite a hundred arrows shot on my left hand, which\r\npricked me like so many needles. Besides this, another hundred were\r\nshot into the air and fell all over my body, and some upon my face.\r\n\r\nWhen this shower of arrows was over, I lay groaning with the pain and\r\ncovering my face with my free hand. I had only just done so in time,\r\nfor immediately another and larger shower fell upon me, and some of\r\nthe little people tried to stick their spears into my sides; but\r\nluckily I had a leather waistcoat on, which the tiny spears could not\r\npierce.\r\n\r\nAfter this, I thought I had better lie still and remain very quiet\r\ntill night came. Then I hoped this odd army would leave me and I\r\nshould be able to set myself free. I was not at all afraid of any\r\nnumber of such small people, once I had the use of my limbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nGULLIVER IS VISITED BY THE EMPEROR\r\n\r\nWhen they saw I was quiet, they stopped shooting arrows; and, as I\r\nwas almost starving, I tried to show them I wanted food by putting my\r\nfinger to my mouth, and looking beseechingly at them, praying them to\r\ngive me something to eat.\r\n\r\nSoon several ladders were put against my sides. Upon these about a\r\nhundred of the people mounted and walked toward my mouth, carrying\r\nbaskets full of meat. This meat was in the same shape as shoulders,\r\nlegs, and loins of mutton, but smaller than the wings of a lark. It\r\nwas all well dressed and cooked, and I ate two or three joints at a\r\nmouthful and took three loaves at a time, which were no bigger than\r\nbullets. The little people gave the food to me as fast as they could,\r\nand showed much wonder at the greatness of my appetite.\r\n\r\nI must confess I was tempted to pick up those who were running over\r\nmy body and throw them to the ground. But remembering the shower of\r\narrows and the food they had given me, I felt I was bound in honor not\r\nto do them harm. I could not help thinking these tiny creatures were\r\nplucky and brave, that they should dare to walk over such a giant as\r\nI must seem to them, although one of my hands was free to seize upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAfter a time there came before me no less a personage than his\r\nImperial Majesty, the Emperor of these odd little people. His Majesty\r\nmounted my right leg and advanced forward to my face, followed by a\r\ndozen of his courtiers.\r\n\r\nAs he stood looking at my face, he spoke for about ten minutes without\r\nany sign of anger, but very gravely and sternly, and often pointing in\r\nfront of him, toward, as I afterwards found, the capital city.\r\n\r\nTo this city the people agreed I was to be carried, and it lay about\r\nhalf a mile off. I made signs to the Emperor that I wanted to be freed\r\nfrom the cords that bound me to the earth, and allowed to rise. But\r\nalthough he understood me well enough, his Majesty shook his head and\r\nshowed me I must be carried as a prisoner. However, he made other\r\nsigns that told me I should have meat and drink, and was not to be\r\nill-treated. After this the Emperor and his train got off my body and\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nSoon after, I felt a great number of people at my left side; and they\r\nloosened the cords that held me, and so let me turn a little upon my\r\nright and get more ease in my uncomfortable position.\r\n\r\nThen they put some sweet-smelling ointment upon my face and hands,\r\nwhich soon removed the smart of the arrows. Being thus refreshed, I\r\nagain fell into a deep sleep, which lasted some hours.\r\n\r\nThese little people were very clever at making all kinds of machines\r\nand engines for carrying heavy weights. They built their ships and\r\nmen-of-war, which were about the length of a large dining-table, in\r\nthe woods where the timber grew, and then carried them to the sea upon\r\nthe machines they made.\r\n\r\nThey now set to work to prepare the greatest engine they had, which\r\nwas a frame of wood, raised three inches from the ground, and about as\r\nlong as one of our bedsteads and nearly as wide across. Five hundred\r\ncarpenters and engineers got this machine into readiness to carry me\r\nto the city. There was loud shouting, as it was brought up to my side;\r\nand then came the chief difficulty, which was how to lift me on to it.\r\n\r\nEighty poles were driven into the ground, each pole about as tall as\r\nan ordinary ruler. Then the workmen bound my neck, hands, body, and\r\nlegs in bandages, and to these bandages they fixed hooks with the\r\nstrongest cords fastened to them. Nine hundred of the strongest men\r\nthen drew up these cords by pulleys attached to the poles, and thus in\r\nabout three hours I was raised and slung upon the machine, and there\r\ntied fast. Fifteen hundred of the Emperor\'s largest horses, each about\r\nfour inches and a half high, were used to draw me on the machine, to\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nWhen at last we arrived at the city gates, the Emperor and all his\r\ncourt came out to meet us. At the place where we stopped there stood\r\na very old temple, which was the largest in the whole kingdom. The\r\npeople no longer used it to worship in, and it had been emptied of\r\nall its furniture and ornaments. It was in this building the Emperor\r\ndecided I should live. The great gate was about four feet high and two\r\nfeet wide, and I could easily creep through it. Upon each side of the\r\ngate was a small window, just six inches from the ground. To one of\r\nthese windows the Emperor\'s smith fixed ninety-one chains, like those\r\nwe use as watch chains in England, and these chains were locked to my\r\nleft leg by thirty-six padlocks. Just in front of the temple there was\r\na turret five feet high, and the Emperor and his principal nobles got\r\nupon the top of this turret to be able to look at me as I lay.\r\n\r\nSo many people crowded from the city to see me, and all mounted upon\r\nmy body by the help of ladders, that at last the Emperor gave an order\r\nthat no one else must do so, on penalty of death. For this I was very\r\nglad, as I was becoming quite worn out.\r\n\r\nWhen the workmen found it was impossible for me to break my chains\r\nand get free, they cut all the strings that bound me, and I rose up\r\nfeeling very strange and sad.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of the people at seeing me rise was truly great. The\r\nchains that held my left leg were two yards long, and that allowed me\r\nto walk backwards and forwards, and also to creep into the temple and\r\nlie down.\r\n\r\n\r\nGULLIVER IS KEPT A PRISONER AT THE CAPITAL\r\n\r\nWhen I found myself on my feet, I looked about at the surrounding\r\ncountry. It seemed like one big garden, and the fields, which were\r\nabout the size of an ordinary room, appeared like so many beds of\r\nflowers. Then there were the little patches of trees, which made the\r\nwoods of this tiny country, and the tallest tree among them was not\r\nmuch higher than an Englishman. The little city itself looked like the\r\npainted scene in a theater.\r\n\r\nAs I was extremely tired, I did not stay long to look, but crept into\r\nmy house and shut the door after me. When I had rested, I came out\r\nagain and stepped backward and forward as far as my chains allowed.\r\nThen the Emperor began to ride up to me; but upon seeing me, the horse\r\ntook fright and nearly threw its rider, which was no wonder, as the\r\npoor animal must have thought I was a moving mountain. The prince was\r\nan excellent horseman and kept his seat well, while his attendants ran\r\nto assist him. Then his Majesty got off his horse and walked up to me\r\nand seemed to look at me with great admiration, but did not come near\r\nenough for me to touch him. He ordered his cooks to bring me more\r\nfood and drink, and they brought me the food put into carriages upon\r\nwheels, which they pushed forward until I could reach them. I very\r\nsoon emptied the carriages.\r\n\r\nThe Empress and the young princes, with many other nobles and ladies,\r\nall came and gathered round the Emperor and watched me while I ate.\r\nHis Majesty was taller than any of the others; that is to say, he\r\nstood about the breadth of my nail above the heads of his people. He\r\nwas handsome and well made and had an air of great dignity. I heard\r\nthat he had reigned seven years, and had been victorious, and that he\r\nwas much respected.\r\n\r\nHis dress was very plain, except that he had on his head a light\r\nhelmet made of gold and adorned with jewels and with a plume upon it.\r\nHe now held his drawn sword in his hand, to defend himself if I should\r\nhappen to break loose. This sword was about three inches long, and the\r\nhilt and case of it were gold, enriched with diamonds.\r\n\r\nAfter about two hours the court went away, and I was left with a guard\r\nof soldiers to keep the people from crowding round me. This guard was\r\nnecessary, for one of the men had the impudence to shoot an arrow\r\nat me as I sat upon the ground, and it nearly hit my eye. Then the\r\nsoldiers ordered the man to be seized and bound and given into my\r\nhands to punish. I took him up and made a face as if I were going\r\nto eat him. The poor little fellow screamed terribly, and even the\r\nsoldiers looked very much alarmed when I took out my penknife.\r\n\r\nHowever, I soon put an end to their fears, for I cut the strings that\r\nbound my captive and set him gently upon the ground and let him run\r\naway. I saw that all the soldiers and people were delighted at this\r\nmark of my mercy and gentleness; and I afterwards heard they told the\r\nEmperor about it, and he was very pleased with me.\r\n\r\nWhen night came, I crept into my shelter again and lay upon the ground\r\nto sleep. The next day the Emperor gave orders for a bed to be made\r\nfor me. The workmen brought six hundred beds to my house in carriages,\r\nand sewed them all together to make one large enough for me to lie\r\nupon. They did the same with sheets and blankets, and at the end of\r\ntwo weeks\' labor my bed was ready for me.\r\n\r\nAs the news of my arrival spread over the kingdom, it brought numbers\r\nof people to see me. The villages were almost emptied, and those men\r\nand women who should have been at work came to the city to gaze at me.\r\nAt last the Emperor gave orders that all who had seen me once were to\r\ngo to their homes immediately, and not come near me again without his\r\nMajesty\'s permission.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and his court met together to talk over what could be done\r\nwith me, which seemed a very difficult question. They were afraid I\r\nmight break my chains and do them harm; then they were afraid that I\r\nwould eat so much that it would cause a famine in the land and there\r\nwould be no food left for them. Luckily for me, his Majesty remembered\r\nthe kind way I had treated the man who shot the arrow at me, and\r\nbecause of my good behavior he allowed me to live. Orders were given\r\nfor each of the villages round the city to send in every morning six\r\ncows and forty sheep for my meals, and also bread and wine, for all of\r\nwhich the Emperor paid.\r\n\r\nI was also given six hundred little men as my servants, and these\r\nbuilt their tents upon each side of my door. Then three hundred\r\ntailors set to work to make me a suit of clothes like those worn in\r\nthat country, and six of the most learned men taught me to speak the\r\nlanguage. Lastly, the Emperor\'s horses and those of the nobles and\r\nsoldiers were ridden and exercised before me, until they became quite\r\nused to seeing me and would trot quietly past.\r\n\r\n\r\nGULLIVER IS GIVEN HIS LIBERTY\r\n\r\nMy quiet and good behavior so pleased the Emperor and his court that I\r\nbegan to hope he would soon give me my liberty. I did all I could to\r\nmake the people like me and lose their fear of me. I would lie down\r\nand let five or six of them dance upon my hand, and at last the boys\r\nand girls even dared to come and play at hide-and-seek in my hair.\r\n\r\nThere was one general, named Skyresh, who was my enemy. I had not\r\ngiven him any cause to dislike me, but he did, and it was he who tried\r\nto persuade the Emperor not to give me my liberty. However, I implored\r\nhis Majesty so often to set me free that at last he promised to do so,\r\nbut he first made me swear to certain conditions which were to be read\r\nto me. These conditions were as follows:\r\n\r\n"His Majesty, the mighty Emperor of Lilliput, proposes to the\r\nMan-Mountain the following articles, which he must swear to perform:\r\n\r\n"First. The Man-Mountain shall not depart from our country without our\r\npermission.\r\n\r\n"Second. He shall not enter our chief city without our express\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\n"Third. He shall walk only along the principal roads, and not over our\r\nmeadows and fields of corn.\r\n\r\n"Fourth. As he walks he must take the greatest care not to trample\r\nupon any of our subjects, or their horses and carriages, and he must\r\nnot take any into his hands without their consent.\r\n\r\n"Fifth. If we desire to send a message anywhere, very quickly, the\r\nMan-Mountain shall be obliged to carry the messenger and his horse in\r\nhis pocket and return with them safe to our court.\r\n\r\n"Sixth. He must promise not to join the army of our enemies in the\r\nisland of Blefuscu, and he must do his utmost to destroy their fleet\r\nof ships, which is now preparing to attack us.\r\n\r\n"Seventh. The Man-Mountain shall always be ready to help our workmen\r\nin lifting heavy weights.\r\n\r\n"Eighth. He must walk all round our island and then tell us how many\r\nsteps round it measures.\r\n\r\n"Lastly. The Man-Mountain shall have a daily allowance of food\r\nsufficient for 1724 of our subjects.\r\n\r\n"All of these conditions he must take a solemn oath to keep. Then he\r\nshall be allowed his liberty."\r\n\r\nI swore to keep these promises, and my chains were at once unlocked\r\nand I was at full liberty. I expressed my gratitude by casting myself\r\nat the Emperor\'s feet, but he graciously commanded me to rise, telling\r\nme he hoped I would prove a useful servant and deserve all the favors\r\nhe had conferred upon me.\r\n\r\nOne morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty, the\r\nprincipal noble who managed the Emperor\'s private affairs, and whose\r\nname was Reldresal, came to my house, attended by only one servant.\r\nHe asked to speak to me privately, and I readily consented, as he had\r\nalways shown me much kindness. I offered to lie down so that he could\r\nspeak into my ear, but he chose to let me hold him in my hand during\r\nour conversation.\r\n\r\nHe told me that the island of Lilliput was threatened with invasion by\r\nan army from the island of Blefuscu, which was the next island, and\r\none almost as large and powerful as Lilliput itself. These two islands\r\nand their Emperors had for some time been engaged in a most obstinate\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nReldresal told me that his Majesty had just heard that the\r\nBlefuscudians had got together a large fleet of warships and were\r\npreparing to invade Lilliput. His Majesty said he placed great trust\r\nin my power to help them in this trouble, and had commanded his\r\nofficer to lay the case before me.\r\n\r\nI told Reldresal to present my humble duty to the Emperor and tell him\r\nI thought it would hardly be fair for me, as I was a foreigner, to\r\ninterfere between the two islands. But I said I was quite ready, even\r\nat the risk of my life, to defend his Majesty\'s state and person\r\nagainst all invaders.\r\n\r\nThe island of Blefuscu was separated from Lilliput by a channel eight\r\nhundred yards wide. I had not yet seen it, but after hearing that the\r\nEmperor of Blefuscu had a fleet of ships upon the water, I kept from\r\ngoing near the coast, as I did not want to be noticed by the enemy.\r\nThe Blefuscudians did not know of my presence in Lilliput. I told his\r\nMajesty, the Emperor of Lilliput, that I had a plan by which I could\r\nseize all the enemy\'s ships.\r\n\r\n\r\nGULLIVER CAPTURES THE BLEFUSCUDIAN FLEET\r\n\r\nI had asked the most clever seamen upon the island how deep the\r\nchannel was, and they told me that in the middle it was about six feet\r\ndeep, and at the sides it was only four feet. I then walked toward the\r\ncoast and lay down behind a hillock; here I took out my telescope and\r\nlooked at the enemy\'s fleet. It consisted of fifty men-of-war and a\r\ngreat number of smaller vessels. I hurried back to my house and gave\r\norders for a quantity of the strongest rope and bars of iron. The\r\nEmperor said all my orders were to be carried out. The rope that was\r\nbrought me was only as thick as our packing thread, and the iron bars\r\nwere the length and size of a knitting-needle. I twisted three lengths\r\nof the rope together to make it stronger, and three of the iron bars\r\nin the same way. I turned up the ends of the bars to form a hook. I\r\nfixed fifty hooks to as many pieces of rope, and then I took them all\r\ndown to the coast.\r\n\r\nHere I took off my shoes and stockings and coat, and walked into the\r\nsea. I waded until I came to the middle of the channel, and, the water\r\nbeing deep there, I was obliged to swim about thirty yards. After this\r\nI waded again, and in less than half an hour I arrived at the fleet of\r\nthe enemy. The Blefuscudians were so frightened when they saw me that\r\nthey leaped out of their ships and swam to shore.\r\n\r\nI then took my hooks and ropes and fastened a hook to the end of each\r\nvessel. Then I tied all the ropes together. While I was doing this,\r\nthe enemy discharged several thousand arrows at me from the shore, and\r\nmany of the arrows stuck in my face and hands. This hurt me very much,\r\nand prevented my working quickly. My worst fear was for my eyes, which\r\nwould certainly have been put out by arrows had I not thought of my\r\nspectacles. These I fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and,\r\nthus protected, I went boldly on, while the arrows struck my glasses\r\nwithout even cracking them.\r\n\r\nWhen I had fastened all my hooks, I took the knot of ropes in my hands\r\nand began to pull. But I could not move a single ship, for they were\r\nall held fast by their anchors. Therefore I let go the cord, and,\r\ntaking my knife from my pocket, I cut the cables that held the\r\nanchors, at the same time receiving about two hundred arrows from\r\nthe enemy, in my face and hands. After this, I once more grasped the\r\nropes, and, with the greatest ease, I pulled fifty of their largest\r\nvessels after me. The Blefuscudians were confounded with astonishment.\r\nThey had seen me cut the cables, but thought I only meant to let the\r\nships run adrift; but when they saw me walking off with almost all of\r\nthe fleet, they set up a tremendous scream of grief and despair.\r\n\r\nWhen I had got out of danger, I stopped to pick out the arrows that\r\nwere stuck in my hands and face, and I rubbed on some of the ointment\r\nthe Lilliputians had given me. Then I took off my spectacles and waded\r\non with my cargo. As the tide was then fallen, I did not need to swim\r\nthrough the middle, but was able to walk right into the royal port of\r\nLilliput.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and all his court stood upon the shore, watching for my\r\nreturn. They saw the ships coming over the water, in the form of a\r\ngreat half-moon, and soon I was able to make the Emperor hear my\r\nvoice. Holding up my rope, I cried aloud, "Long live the most glorious\r\nEmperor of Lilliput!"\r\n\r\nHis Majesty received me with great joy and honor, and made me a lord\r\nof the island upon the spot.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor then wished me to try to bring all the rest of the enemy\'s\r\nships to Lilliput. And he talked of taking the whole island of\r\nBlefuscu, and reigning over it himself. I did not think this at all\r\nfair, but very selfish and greedy of his Majesty. I tried to tell him\r\nso as politely as I could, and said I could not help to bring a free\r\nand brave people into slavery. My bold speech made the Emperor very\r\nangry indeed, and he never forgave me. But most of his best nobles\r\nthought the same as I did, although they dared not say so openly.\r\n\r\nFrom this time his Majesty and some of his court began to bear me\r\nill-will, which nearly ended in my death. I considered this very mean\r\nof the Emperor, after my helping him as I did; but like many other\r\npeople, he became ungrateful when he found he could not get all he\r\nwanted. About three weeks after this the Emperor of Blefuscu sent\r\nmessengers with humble offers to make peace; to this the Lilliputians\r\nagreed, upon certain terms.\r\n\r\nThe messengers consisted of six nobles with a train of five hundred\r\nmen. They were all very grandly and magnificently dressed. After they\r\nhad spoken to our Emperor, they expressed a wish to come to visit me.\r\nIt seems they were told I had been their friend when the Emperor asked\r\nme to help him take Blefuscu, and they came to thank me for my justice\r\nand generosity. They invited me to visit their island, where I should\r\nreceive every kindness and hospitality. I thanked their lordships very\r\nmuch, and said I should be pleased to come and pay my respects to the\r\nEmperor of Blefuscu before I returned to my own country.\r\n\r\nSo the next time I saw our Emperor I begged his permission to go to\r\nBlefuscu, which he was gracious enough to grant me, although in a very\r\ncold manner. I afterwards heard that my request displeased him, and he\r\ndid not like my making friends of the Blefuscudians.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INHABITANTS OF LILLIPUT--THEIR LAWS AND CUSTOMS\r\n\r\nI am now going to say a few words about the Lilliputians and their\r\nlaws and customs.\r\n\r\nThese little people are generally about six inches high, their horses\r\nand oxen between four and five inches, their sheep an inch and a half,\r\nand their geese about the size of a sparrow. One day I watched a cook\r\npulling the feathers off a lark, which was no bigger than a fly.\r\n\r\nSome of their laws are very unlike our English ones, but they are very\r\njust all the same. If a man accuses another of any crime, and it\r\nis proved that he has told a lie and the man is innocent, then the\r\naccuser is severely punished, and the innocent man is rewarded for all\r\nthe injustice and pain he has suffered. This keeps people from being\r\nso ready to tell tales about others.\r\n\r\nThen deceit and cunning are considered greater crimes than stealing in\r\nLilliput, for the people say that a man can take means to protect his\r\ngoods and money, but he cannot prevent another man\'s deceiving him.\r\nAnd so, if any man makes a promise of importance to another and\r\nthen breaks it, he is severely punished. Also, if he has any money\r\nbelonging to another and has promised to take care of it, and then\r\nloses it through carelessness or spends any upon himself, he is\r\nguilty of a crime. Another law is that not only the guilty should be\r\npunished, but that the innocent shall be rewarded. So that whoever\r\nshall behave himself well and keep the laws of his country for a whole\r\nyear, shall receive a sum of money and a favor from the Emperor.\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor has some special favor to confer, or position to\r\noffer, he does not choose the most clever or learned man to give it\r\nto, but picks out the one who has been the best behaved and who is the\r\nbravest and truest among his subjects.\r\n\r\nIngratitude among the Lilliputians is considered a capital crime, and\r\nanyone who returns evil for good is judged not fit to live.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that the Emperor and his people did not keep these\r\ngood laws as they should have done, for if they had, his Majesty would\r\nnever have treated me so badly after I had done my best to help him.\r\n\r\nIn Lilliput there are large public schools to which parents are bound\r\nto send their children. Here they are educated and fitted for some\r\nposition in life, for no one is allowed to be idle.\r\n\r\nAll the children are brought up very well indeed, and taught to be\r\nhonorable, courageous, and truthful men and women.\r\n\r\nThe nurses are forbidden to tell the children foolish or frightening\r\nstories, and if they are found to do so, they are soundly whipped and\r\nsent to a most lonely part of the country.\r\n\r\nAnd now I will give a further account of my own way of living among\r\nthese strange little people.\r\n\r\nI had made myself a table and chair, as large as I could get out of\r\nthe biggest tree in the royal park. Two hundred sewing women were\r\nemployed to make my shirts and the linen for my bed and table. They\r\ngot the strongest and coarsest linen the island could produce, and\r\neven then they were obliged to sew several folds together to make it\r\nstrong enough for my use. The sewing women took my measure as I lay\r\nupon the ground, one standing at my neck and another at my leg, with a\r\nstrong cord that each held, one at one end and one at the other.\r\n\r\nOne clever woman fitted me for a shirt by simply taking the width of\r\nmy right thumb, for she said that twice round the thumb is once round\r\nthe wrist, and twice round the wrist is once round the neck, and twice\r\nround the neck is once round the waist. By this means she was able to\r\nfit me exactly.\r\n\r\nThe three hundred tailors who were employed to make my clothes had\r\nanother way of measuring me. I knelt down, and they raised a ladder\r\nfrom the ground to my neck; upon this ladder one man mounted, and let\r\nfall a cord from my collar to the floor, which was the length for my\r\ncoat. My waist and arms I measured myself. As the largest piece of\r\ncloth made in the island was only about the size of a yard of wide\r\nribbon, my clothes looked like a patchwork quilt; only, the cloth was\r\nall of the same color.\r\n\r\nI had three hundred cooks to prepare my food, and each one cooked me\r\ntwo dishes. When I was ready for my meal, I took up twenty waiters in\r\nmy hand and placed them upon the table; a hundred more attended on the\r\nground, carrying the dishes. The waiters upon the table drew these\r\nthings up by cords, as we might draw a bucket from a well.\r\n\r\nOne joint of meat generally made a mouthful for me, but once I\r\nactually had a sirloin of beef so large that I was forced to make\r\nthree bites of it. I never had another as big. The geese and turkeys\r\nalso only made a mouthful, and of the small fowl I could take up\r\ntwenty at a time on my fork.\r\n\r\n\r\nGULLIVER ESCAPES TO BLEFUSCU\r\n\r\nI must now tell my reader of a great plot that had been formed against\r\nme in the island of Lilliput.\r\n\r\nI was preparing to pay my promised visit to the Emperor of Blefuscu,\r\nwhen one day a Lilliputian noble called at my house privately, and at\r\nnight; and without sending in his name, he asked me to allow him to\r\ncome in and speak to me.\r\n\r\nI went out and picked up his lordship and brought him on to my table.\r\nThen I fastened the door of my house and sat down in front of the\r\nnoble. As I saw he looked very anxious and troubled, I asked him if\r\nanything was the matter. At that he begged me to listen to him with\r\npatience, as he had much to tell me that concerned my life and honor.\r\nI replied that I was all eagerness to hear him, and this is what he\r\ntold me:\r\n\r\n"You must know," said he, "that his Majesty has lately had many\r\nprivate meetings with his nobles about yourself. And two days ago he\r\nformed a plan that will do you great injury. You know that Skyresh has\r\nalways been your mortal enemy; and his hatred grew even more when\r\nyou so successfully won the ships of the Blefuscudians. He was very\r\njealous, and considered you had taken away some of the glory that\r\nought to have been his, as an admiral of his Majesty. This lord, with\r\nsome others who dislike you, has prepared a charge against you of\r\ntreason and other crimes. Now, because I consider this to be unjust\r\ntreatment, and because you have always shown me kindness and courtesy,\r\nI have risked my life to come here tonight to warn you.\r\n\r\n"Skyresh and the other nobles insisted that you should be put to\r\ndeath, and that in the most cruel way: either by setting fire to your\r\nhouse while you slept, or by having you shot with poisoned arrows by\r\ntwenty thousand men. But his Majesty could not be persuaded to do\r\nthis cruelty, and decided to spare your life. Then Reldresal, who has\r\nalways been your true friend, was asked by the Emperor to give his\r\nopinion, which he accordingly did.\r\n\r\n"He allowed your crimes to be very great, but said that he considered\r\nmercy ought to be shown you in return for the services you had\r\nrendered the Empire. He advised his Majesty to spare your life, but\r\nhave both your eyes put out. By this means justice would be satisfied,\r\nand the loss of your eyes would not take from your bodily strength, so\r\nthat you could still be useful to us. This proposal of Reldresal was\r\nnot at all approved by the other lords. Skyresh flew into a great\r\npassion, and said he wondered Reldresal could dare to wish to save\r\nthe life of a traitor. He again accused you of being a traitor, and\r\ninsisted that you should be put to death.\r\n\r\n"Still his Majesty refused to consent to your death, but said that,\r\nas the court did not consider putting out your eyes was sufficient\r\npunishment for your crimes, some other must be thought of.\r\n\r\n"Then Reldresal again spoke, saying that, as it cost so much to feed\r\nyou, another way of punishing you would be to give you less and less\r\nto eat, until you were gradually starved to death.\r\n\r\n"This proposal was agreed upon, but it was decided to keep the plan of\r\nstarving you a great secret. In three days from now Reldresal will be\r\nsent here to read these accusations I have now told to you, and to\r\ntell you that his Majesty condemns you to the loss of your eyes.\r\nTwenty of his Majesty\'s surgeons will attend in order to perform the\r\noperation, which will be done by shooting very sharp pointed arrows\r\ninto the balls of your eyes as you lie upon the ground.\r\n\r\n"I have now told you all that will happen to you, and must leave you\r\nto act as you think best. As no one must know I have been here with\r\nyou now, I must hasten back to the court as secretly as I can."\r\n\r\nThis his lordship immediately did, leaving me in much doubt and\r\ntrouble. Knowing the good and just laws of the island of Lilliput,\r\nI was much shocked and astonished to find the Emperor could so far\r\nforget them as to condemn an innocent man to so brutal a punishment. I\r\ntried to think what I had better do to save myself. My first idea was\r\nto wait quietly and go through with my trial. Then I could plead my\r\ninnocence and try to obtain mercy. But, upon second thoughts, I saw\r\nthat this was a dangerous, almost a hopeless, plan, as my enemies at\r\ncourt were so bitter against me.\r\n\r\nThen I almost made up my mind to use my own strength, for while I had\r\nliberty I knew that I could easily overcome all the Lilliputians and\r\nknock the city to pieces with stones. But I put the idea away as\r\nunfair and dishonorable, because I had given my oath not to harm the\r\nisland and its inhabitants. And even though the Emperor was so unjust\r\nand cruel to me, I did not consider that his conduct freed me from the\r\npromise I had made.\r\n\r\nAt last I formed a plan by which I hoped to save my eyesight and my\r\nliberty, and, as things proved, it was a very fortunate plan for me.\r\nAs I had obtained the Emperor\'s permission to visit the island of\r\nBlefuscu, I at once made preparations to go there. I sent a letter to\r\nReldresal telling him I intended to visit Blefuscu, according to the\r\npermission I had obtained from his Majesty, and that I was starts g\r\nthat morning. By wading and swimming I crossed the channel and reached\r\nthe port of Blefuscu.\r\n\r\nI found the people there had long expected me, and they appeared very\r\npleased to see me. They lent me two guides to show me the way to the\r\ncapital city. These men I held in my hands, while they directed me\r\nwhich way to take. Having arrived at the city gate, I put them down\r\nand desired them to tell his Majesty, the Emperor of Blefuscu, that I\r\nwas awaiting his commands.\r\n\r\nI had an answer in about an hour, which was that his Majesty and the\r\nroyal family were coming out to receive me.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and his train then rode out of the palace, and the Empress\r\nand her ladies also drove up in coaches. They did not seem at all\r\nfrightened at seeing me. I lay upon the ground to kiss his Majesty\'s\r\nand the Empress\'s hands. I told his Majesty I had come according to my\r\npromise and with the consent of the Emperor of Lilliput, and that\r\nI considered it a great honor to receive the welcome I did. I also\r\nbegged to offer his Majesty any service I could render him.\r\n\r\nI was treated with much kindness and generosity while at Blefuscu; but\r\nas there was no place large enough for me to get into, I had to be\r\nwithout house and bed. So I was forced to sleep upon the ground,\r\nwrapped in my cloak.\r\n\r\n\r\nGULLIVER RETURNS TO ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThree days after my arrival at Blefuscu I was walking along the coast,\r\nwhen I suddenly caught sight of some object in the sea that looked\r\nlike a boat overturned. I pulled off my shoes and stockings, and waded\r\nout into the water. As I drew near the object, I could plainly see\r\nthat it was a big boat, which, I suppose, must have been driven there\r\nby some tempest. Having made this discovery, I hastened back to shore\r\nand went to the city to beg his Majesty to lend me twenty of his\r\ntallest ships, and three thousand sailors, under the command of an\r\nadmiral.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor gave his consent, and the fleet of ships sailed to the\r\nplace where I had discovered the boat. I again waded into the water,\r\nand found that the tide had driven the boat still nearer the shore.\r\nThe sailors in the ships were all provided with cord, which I had\r\ntwisted together and made strong. I walked as near the boat as I\r\ncould, then swam up to it. The sailors threw me the end of the\r\ncord, which I fastened to part of the boat and the other end to a\r\nman-of-war. Then, getting behind the boat, I swam and pushed it as\r\nbest I could with one hand until I had got it out of the deep water.\r\nBeing then able to walk, I rested a few minutes, and then, taking\r\nsome other ropes, I fastened all of them to the boat and they to\r\nthe vessels the Emperor had lent me. Then the sailors pulled, and I\r\nshoved, and, the wind being favorable, we arrived at the shore of\r\nBlefuscu, dragging the boat with us. With the help of two thousand\r\nmen, with ropes and engines, I was able to turn the boat upon the\r\nright side, and found it was in quite good condition.\r\n\r\nAfter this I worked hard for many days making paddles for my boat,\r\nand getting it ready to go to sea in. The people of Blefuscu came and\r\ngazed in wonder and astonishment at so immense a vessel. I told the\r\nEmperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way to carry\r\nme to some place from which I might be able to return to my native\r\nland. And I begged his Majesty to allow me to have materials with\r\nwhich to fit it up, and also to give me his gracious permission to\r\ndepart when it was ready. This his Majesty most kindly granted me.\r\n\r\nFive hundred workmen were employed to make two sails for my boat,\r\nunder my directions. This had to be done by sewing together thirteen\'\r\nfolds of their strongest linen. Then I made rope by twisting together\r\ntwenty or thirty lengths of the stoutest cord upon the island. After a\r\nlong search by the seashore I discovered a large stone, which had\r\nto serve me for an anchor. I used the fat of three hundred cows for\r\ngreasing my boat. Then I set to work and cut down some of the largest\r\ntrees to make into oars and masts. His Majesty\'s carpenters helped me\r\ngreatly in smoothing them after I had cut them into shape.\r\n\r\nIn about a month all was ready, and I sent to tell his Majesty I was\r\ngoing to take my leave.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and royal family came out of the palace and allowed me\r\nto kiss their hands. His Majesty presented me with fifty purses\r\ncontaining two hundred pieces of gold hands. I told his Majesty I had\r\ncome according to my promise and with the consent of the Emperor\r\nof Lilliput, and that I considered it a great honor to receive the\r\nwelcome I did. I also begged to offer his Majesty any service I could\r\nrender him.\r\n\r\nI was treated with much kindness and generosity while at Blefuscu; but\r\nas there was no place large enough for me to get into, I had to be\r\nwithout house and bed. So I was forced to sleep upon the ground,\r\nwrapped in my cloak.\r\n\r\n\r\nGULLIVER RETURNS TO ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThree days after my arrival at Blefuscu I was walking along the coast,\r\nwhen I suddenly caught sight of some object in the sea that looked\r\nlike a boat overturned. I pulled off my shoes and stockings, and waded\r\nout into the water. As I drew near the object, I could plainly see\r\nthat it was a big boat, which, I suppose, must have been driven there\r\nby some tempest. Having made this discovery, I hastened back to shore\r\nand went to the city to beg his Majesty to lend me twenty of his\r\ntallest ships, and three thousand sailors, under the command of an\r\nadmiral.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor gave his consent, and the fleet of ships sailed to the\r\nplace where I had discovered the boat. I again waded into the water,\r\nand found that the tide had driven the boat still nearer the shore.\r\nThe sailors in the ships were all provided with cord, which I had\r\ntwisted together and made strong. I walked as near the boat as I\r\ncould, then swam up to it. The sailors threw me the end of the\r\ncord, which I fastened to part of the boat and the other end to a\r\nman-of-war. Then, getting behind the boat, I swam and pushed it as\r\nbest I could with one hand until I had got it out of the deep water.\r\nBeing then able to walk, I rested a few minutes, and then, taking\r\nsome other ropes, I fastened all of them to the boat and they to\r\nthe vessels the Emperor had lent me. Then the sailors pulled, and I\r\nshoved, and, the wind being favorable, we arrived at the shore of\r\nBlefuscu, dragging the boat with us. With the help of two thousand\r\nmen, with ropes and engines, I was able to turn the boat upon the\r\nright side, and found it was in quite good condition.\r\n\r\nAfter this I worked hard for many days making paddles for my boat,\r\nand getting it ready to go to sea in. The people of Blefuscu came and\r\ngazed in wonder and astonishment at so immense a vessel. I told the\r\nEmperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way to carry\r\nme to some place from which I might be able to return to my native\r\nland. And I begged his Majesty to allow me to have materials with\r\nwhich to fit it up, and also to give me his gracious permission to\r\ndepart when it was ready. This his Majesty most kindly granted me.\r\n\r\nFive hundred workmen were employed to make two sails for my boat,\r\nunder my directions. This had to be done by sewing together thirteen\'\r\nfolds of their strongest linen. Then I made rope by twisting together\r\ntwenty or thirty lengths of the stoutest cord upon the island. After a\r\nlong search by the seashore I discovered a large stone, which had\r\nto serve me for an anchor. I used the fat of three hundred cows for\r\ngreasing my boat. Then I set to work and cut down some of the largest\r\ntrees to make into oars and masts. His Majesty\'s carpenters helped me\r\ngreatly in smoothing them after I had cut them into shape.\r\n\r\nIn about a month all was ready, and I sent to tell his Majesty I was\r\ngoing to take my leave.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and royal family came out of the palace and allowed me\r\nto kiss their hands.

From the\r\ntime that I was quite a young child I had felt a great wish to spend\r\nmy life at sea, and as I grew, so did this taste grow more and more\r\nstrong; till at last on September first, 1651, I ran away from my\r\nschool and home, and found my way on foot to Hull, where I soon got a\r\nplace on board a ship.\r\n\r\nNever did any young adventurer\'s misfortunes begin sooner or continue\r\nlonger than mine, for when we were far out at sea, some Turks in a\r\nsmall ship came on our track in full chase. After a long pursuit our\r\nvessel was captured, and all on board were taken as slaves.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the Turks took me as his prize to a port which was held\r\nby the Moors. There I remained in slavery for several years, and\r\nbitterly did I repent my rash act in leaving my good parents in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAt length I found an opportunity to escape to a vessel that was\r\npassing by, and was kindly received by the captain, who proved to be\r\nan English sailor bound on a voyage of trade.\r\n\r\nI had not been aboard more than twelve days when a high wind took us\r\noff, we knew not where. All at once there was a cry of "Land!" and the\r\nship struck on a bank of sand, in which she sank so deep that we could\r\nnot get her off. At last we found that we must make up our minds to\r\nleave her and get to shore as well as we could. There had been a boat\r\nat her stern, but we found it had been torn off by the force of the\r\nwaves. One small boat was still left on the ship\'s side, so we got\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nThere we were, all of us, on the wild sea. The heart of s each now\r\ngrew faint, our cheeks were pale, and our eyes were dim, for there was\r\nbut one hope, and that was to find some bay, and so get in the lee of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThe sea grew more and more rough, and its white foam would curl and\r\nboil till at last the waves in their wild sport burst on the boat\'s\r\nside, and we were all thrown out.\r\n\r\nI could swim well, but the force of the waves made me lose my breath\r\ntoo much to do so. At length one large wave took me to the shore and\r\nleft me high and dry, though half dead with fear. I got on my feet and\r\nmade the best of my way for the land; but just then the curve of a\r\nhuge wave rose up as high as a hill, and this I had no strength to\r\nkeep from, so it took me back to the sea. I did my best to float on\r\nthe top, and held my breath to do so. The next wave was quite as high,\r\nand shut me up in its bulk. I held my hands down tight to my sides,\r\nand then my head shot out at the top of the waves. This gave me\r\nbreath, and soon my feet felt the ground.\r\n\r\nI stood quite still for a short time, to let the sea run back from me,\r\nand then I set off with all my might to the shore, but yet the waves\r\ncaught me, and twice more did they take me back, and twice more land\r\nme on the shore. I thought the last wave would have been the death\r\nof me, for it drove me on a piece of rock, and with such force as to\r\nleave me in a kind of swoon. I soon regained my senses and got up to\r\nthe cliffs close to the shore, where I found some grass out of the\r\nreach of the sea. There I sat down, safe on land at last.\r\n\r\nI felt so wrapped in joy that all I could do was to walk up and down\r\nthe coast, now lift up my hands, now fold them on my breast and thank\r\nGod for all that he had done for me, when the rest of the men were\r\nlost. I now cast my eyes round me, to find out what kind of place it\r\nwas that I had been thus thrown in, like a bird in a storm. Then all\r\nthe glee I felt at first left me; for I was wet and cold, and had no\r\ndry clothes to put on, no food to eat, and not a friend to help me.\r\n\r\nI feared that there might be wild beasts here, and I had no gun to\r\nshoot them with, or to keep me from their jaws. I had but a knife and\r\na pipe.\r\n\r\nIt now grew dark; and where was I to go for the night? I thought the\r\ntop of some high tree would be a good place to keep me out of harm\'s\r\nway; and that there I might sit and think of death, for, as yet, I had\r\nno hope of life.\r\n\r\nWell, I went to my tree and made a kind of nest to sleep in. Then I\r\ncut a stick to keep off beasts of prey, in case any should come, and\r\n-fell asleep just as if the branch I lay on had been a bed of down.\r\n\r\nWhen I woke up, it was broad day; the sky too was clear and the sea\r\ncalm. But I saw from the top of the tree that in the night the ship\r\nhad left the bank of sand, and lay but a mile from me. I soon threw\r\noff my clothes, took to the sea, and swam up to the wreck. But how was\r\nI to get on deck? I had gone twice around the ship, when a piece of\r\nrope caught my eye, which hung down from her side so low that at first\r\nthe waves hid it. By the help of this rope I got on board.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW I MADE AND USED A RAFT\r\n\r\nI found that there was a bulge in the ship, and that she had sprung\r\na leak. You may be sure that my first thought was to look around for\r\nsome food, and I soon made my way to the bin where the bread was kept,\r\nand ate some of it as I went to and fro, for there was no time to\r\nlose. What I stood most in need of was a boat to take the goods to\r\nshore. But it was vain to wish for that which could not be had; and as\r\nthere were some spare yards in the ship, two or three large planks,\r\nand a mast or two; I fell to work with these to make a raft.\r\n\r\nI put four spars side by side, and laid short bits of plank on them,\r\ncrossways, to make my raft strong. Though these planks would bear my\r\nown weight, they were too slight to bear much of my freight. So I took\r\na saw, which was on board, and cut a mast in three lengths, and these\r\ngave great strength to the raft. I found some bread and rice, a Dutch\r\ncheese, and some dry goat\'s flesh.\r\n\r\nMy next task was to screen my goods from the spray of the sea; and\r\nthis did not take long, for there were three large chests on board\r\nwhich held all, and these I put on the raft.\r\n\r\n"See, here is a prize!" said I, out loud (though there was none to\r\nhear me); "now I shall not starve." For I found four large guns. But\r\nhow was my raft to be got to land? I had no sail, no oars; and a gust\r\nof wind would make all my store slide off. Yet there were three things\r\nwhich I was glad of a calm sea, a tide which set in to the shore, and\r\na slight breeze to blow me there.\r\n\r\nI had the good luck to find some oars in a part of the ship in which I\r\nhad made no search till now. With these I put to sea, and for half a\r\nmile my raft went well; but soon I found it driven to one side. At\r\nlength I saw a creek, up which, with some toil, I took my raft.\r\n\r\nI saw that there were birds on the isle, and I shot one of them. Mine\r\nmust have been the first gun that had been heard there since the world\r\nwas made; for, at the sound of it, whole flocks of birds flew up, with\r\nloud cries, from all parts of the wood. The shape of the beak of the\r\none I shot was like that of a hawk, but the claws were not so large.\r\n\r\nI now went back to my raft to land my stores, and this took up the\r\nrest of the day: What to do at night I knew not, nor where to find a\r\nsafe place to land my stores on. I did not like to lie down on the\r\nground, for fear of beasts of prey, as well as snakes; but there was\r\nno cause for these fears, as I have since found. I put the chests and\r\nboards round me as well as I could, and made a kind of hut for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAs there was still a great store of things left in the ship which\r\nwould be of use to me, I thought that I ought to bring them to land at\r\nonce; for I knew that the first storm would break up the ship. So I\r\nwent on board, and took good care this time not to load my raft too\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nThe first thing sought for was the tool chest; and in it were some\r\nbags of nails, spikes, saws, knives, and such things; but best of all,\r\nI found a stone to grind my tools on. There were two or three flasks,\r\nsome large bags of shot, and a roll of lead; but this last I had not\r\nthe strength to hoist up to the ship\'s side, so as to get it on my\r\nraft. There were some spare sails too, which I brought to shore.\r\n\r\nNow that I had two freights of goods on hand, I made a tent with the\r\nship\'s sails, to stow them in, and cut the poles for it from the wood.\r\nI now took all the things out of the casks and chests and put the\r\ncasks in piles round the tent to give it strength; and when this was\r\ndone, I shut up the door with the boards, spread on the ground one of\r\nthe beds which I had brought from the ship, laid two guns close to my\r\nhead and went to bed for the first time. I slept all night, for I was\r\nmuch in need of rest.\r\n\r\nThe next day I was sad and sick at heart, for I felt how dull it was\r\nto be thus cut off from all the rest of the world! I had no great wish\r\nfor work; but there was too much to be done for me to dwell long on my\r\nsad lot. Each day, as it came, I went off to the wreck to fetch more\r\nthings; and I brought back as much as the raft would hold.\r\n\r\nThe last time I went to the wreck the wind blew so hard that I made\r\nup my mind to go on board next time at low tide. I found some tea and\r\nsome gold coin; but as to the gold, it made me laugh to look at it.\r\n"O drug!" said I, "thou art of no use to me! I care not to save thee.\r\nStay where thou art till the ship goes down; then go thou with it!"\r\nStill, I thought I might just as well take it; so I put it in a piece\r\nof the sail and threw it on deck, that I might place it on the raft.\r\nBy-and-by the wind blew from the shore, so I had to hurry back with\r\nall speed; for I knew that at the turn of the tide I should find it\r\nhard work to get to land at all. But in spite of the high wind I came\r\nto my home all safe. At dawn I put my head out and cast my eyes on the\r\nsea, when lo! no ship was there!. This great change in the face of\r\nthings, and the loss of such a friend, quite struck me down. Yet I was\r\nglad to think that I had brought to shore all that could be of use to\r\nme. I had now to look out for some spot where I could make my home.\r\nHalfway up the hill there was a small plain, four or five score feet\r\nlong and twice as broad; and as it had a full view of the sea, I\r\nthought that it would be a good place for my house.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW I MADE MYSELF A HOME ON THE ISLAND\r\n\r\nI first dug a trench round a space which took in twelve yards; and in\r\nthis I drove two rows of stakes, till they stood firm like piles, five\r\nand a half feet from the ground. I made the stakes close and tight\r\nwith bits of rope and put small sticks on the top of them in the shape\r\nof spikes. This made so strong a fence that no man or beast could get\r\nin. The door of my house was on top, and I had to climb up to it by\r\nsteps, which I took in with me, so that no one else might come up by\r\nthe same way. Close to the back of the house stood a sand rock, in\r\nwhich I made a cave, and laid all the earth that I had dug out of it\r\nround my house, to the height of a foot and a half. I had to go out\r\nonce a day in search of food. The first time, I saw some, goats, but\r\nthey were too shy to let me get near them. At first I thought that for\r\nthe lack of pen and ink I should lose all note of time; so I made a\r\nlarge post, in the shape of a cross, on which I cut these words: "I\r\ncame on shore here on the thirtieth of September, 1659." On the side\r\nof this post I made a notch each day, and this I kept up till the\r\nlast. I have not yet said a word of my four pets, which were two cats,\r\na dog, and a parrot. You may guess how fond I was of them, for they\r\nwere all the friends left to me. I brought the dog and two cats from\r\nthe ship. The dog would fetch things for me at all times, and by his\r\nbark, his whine, his growl, and his tricks, he would all but talk to\r\nme; yet he could not give me thought for thought. If I could but have\r\nhad someone near me to find fault with, or to find fault with me, what\r\na treat it would have been!\r\n\r\nI was a long way out of the course of ships; and oh! how dull it was\r\nto be cast on this lone spot with no one to love, no one to make me\r\nlaugh, no one to make me weep, no one to make me think.. It was dull\r\nto roam day by day from the wood to the shore, and from the shore back\r\nto the wood, and feed on my own thoughts all the while.\r\n\r\nSo much for the sad view of my case; but like most things, it had a\r\nbright side as well as a dark one. For here was I safe on land, while\r\nall the rest of the ship\'s crew were lost. True, I was cast on a rough\r\nand rude part of the globe, but there were no beasts of prey on it to\r\nkill or hurt me. God had sent the ship so near to me that I had got\r\nfrom it all things to meet my wants for the rest of my days. Let life\r\nbe what it might, there was surely much to thank God for. And I soon\r\ngave up all dull thoughts, and did not so much as look out for a sail.\r\n\r\nMy goods from the wreck remained in the cave for more than ten months;\r\nI decided then that it was time to put them right, as they took up all\r\nthe space and left me no room to turn in; so I made my small cave a\r\nlarge one, and dug it out a long way back in the sand rock.\r\n\r\nThen I brought the mouth of the cave up to my fence, and so made a\r\nback way to my house. This done, I put shelves on each side to hold my\r\ngoods, which made the cave look like a shop full of stores. To make\r\nthese shelves was a very difficult task and took a long time; for to\r\nmake a board I was forced to cut down a whole tree, chop away with my\r\nax till one side was flat, and then cut at the other side till the\r\nboard was thin enough, when I smoothed it with my adz. But, in this\r\nway, out of each tree I would get only one plank. I made for myself\r\nalso a table and a chair, and finally got my castle, as I called it,\r\nin good order.\r\n\r\nI usually rose early and worked till noon, when I ate my meal; then I\r\nwent out with my gun, after which I worked once more till the sun had\r\nset; and then to bed. It took me more than a week to change the shape\r\nand size of my cave. Unfortunately, I made it far too large, for,\r\nlater on, the earth fell in from the roof; and had I been in it when\r\nthis took place, I should have lost my life. I had now to set up posts\r\nin my cave, with planks on the top of them, so as to make a roof of\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW I SUPPLIED MY NEEDS\r\n\r\n\r\nI had to go to bed at dusk, till I made a lamp of goat\'s fat, which I\r\nput in a clay dish; and this, with a piece of hemp for a wick, made\r\na good light. As I had found a, use for the bag which had held the\r\nfowls\' food on board ship, I shook out from it the husks of grain.\r\nThis was just at the time when the great rains fell, and in the course\r\nof a month, blades of rice and barley sprang up. As time went by, and\r\nthe grain was ripe, I kept it, and took care to sow it each year; but\r\nI could not boast of a crop of grain for three years.\r\n\r\nI knew that tools would be my first want and that I should have to\r\ngrind mine on the stone, as they were blunt and worn with use. But as\r\nit took both hands to hold the tool, I could not turn the stone; so I\r\nmade a wheel by which I could move it with my foot. This was no small\r\ntask, but I took great pains with it, and at length it was done.\r\n\r\nI had now been in the isle twelve months, and I thought it was time to\r\ngo all round it in search of its woods, springs, and creeks. So I set\r\noff, and brought back with me limes and grapes in their prime, large\r\nand ripe. I had hung the grapes in the sun to dry, and in a few days\'\r\ntime went to fetch them, that I might lay up a store. The vale on the\r\nbanks of which they grew was fresh and green, and a clear, bright\r\nstream ran through it, which gave so great a charm to the spot as to\r\nmake me wish to live there.\r\n\r\nBut there was no view of the sea from this vale, while from my house\r\nno ships could come on my side of the isle and not be seen by me; yet\r\nthe cool, soft banks were so sweet and new to me that much of my time\r\nwas spent there.\r\n\r\nIn the first of the three years in which I had grown barley, I had\r\nsown it too late; in the next it was spoiled by the drought; but the\r\nthird year\'s crop had sprung up well.\r\n\r\nFew of us think of the cost at which a loaf of bread is made. Of\r\ncourse, there was no plow here to turn up the earth, and no spade to\r\ndig it with, so I made one with wood; but this was soon worn out, and\r\nfor want of a rake I made use of the bough of a tree. When I had got\r\nthe grain home, I had to thresh it, part the grain from the chaff, and\r\nstore it up. Then came the want of sieves to clean it, of a mill to\r\ngrind it, and of yeast to make bread of it.\r\n\r\nIf I could have found a large stone, slightly hollow on top, I might,\r\nby pounding the grain on it with another round stone, have made very\r\ngood meal. But all the stones I could find were too soft; and in the\r\nend I had to make a sort of mill of hard wood, in which I burned a\r\nhollow place, and in that pounded the grain into\' meal with a heavy\r\nstick.\r\n\r\nBaking I did by building a big fire, raking away the ashes, and\r\nputting the dough on the hot place, covered with a kind of basin made\r\nof clay, over which \'I had heaped the red ashes.\r\n\r\nThus my bread was made, though I had no tools; and no one could say\r\nthat I did not earn it by the sweat of my brow. When the rain kept me\r\nindoors, it was good fun to teach my pet bird Poll to talk; but so\r\nmute were all things round me that the sound of my own voice made me\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nMy chief wants now were jars, pots, cups, and plates, but I knew not\r\nhow I could make them. At last I went in search of clay, and found a\r\nbank of it a mile from my house; but it was quite a joke to see the\r\nqueer shapes and forms that I made out of it. For some of my pots and\r\njars were too weak to bear their own weight; and they would fall out\r\nhere, and in there, in all sorts of ways; while some, when they were\r\nput in the sun to bake, would crack with the heat of its rays. You may\r\nguess what my joy was when at last a pot was made which would stand\r\nthe fire, so that I could boil the meat for broth!\r\n\r\nThe next thing to turn my thoughts to was the ship\'s boat, which lay\r\non the high ridge of sand, where it had been thrust by the storm which\r\nhad cast me on these shores. But it lay with the keel to the sky, so\r\nI had to dig the sand from it and turn it up with the help of a pole.\r\nWhen I had done this, I found it was all in vain, for I had not the\r\nstrength to launch it. So all I could do now was to make a boat of\r\nless size out of a tree; and I found one that was just fit for it,\r\nwhich grew not far from the shore, but I could no more stir this than\r\nI could the ship\'s boat.\r\n\r\n"Well," thought I, "I must give up the boat, and with it all my hopes\r\nof leaving the isle. But I have this to think of: I am lord of the\r\nwhole isle; in fact, a king. I have wood with which I might build a\r\nfleet, and grapes, if not grain, to freight it with, though all my\r\nwealth is but a few gold coins." For these I had no sort of use, and\r\ncould have found it in my heart to give them all for a peck of peas\r\nand some ink, which last I stood much in need of. But it was best to\r\ndwell more on what I had than on what I had not.\r\n\r\nI now must needs try once more to build a boat, but this time it was\r\nto have a mast, for which the ship\'s sails would be of great use. I\r\nmade a deck at each end to keep out the spray of the sea, a bin for my\r\nfood, and a rest for my gun, with a flap to screen it from the wet.\r\nMore than all, the boat was one of such a size that I could launch it.\r\n\r\nMy first cruise was up and down the creek, but soon I got bold, and\r\nmade the whole round of my isle. I took with me bread, cakes, a pot of\r\nrice, half a goat, and two greatcoats, one of which was to lie on, and\r\none to put on at night. I set sail in the sixth year of my reign. On\r\nthe east side of the isle there was a large ridge of rocks which lay\r\ntwo miles from the shore, and a shoal of sand lay for half a mile from\r\nthe rocks to the beach. To get round this point I had to sail a great\r\nway out to sea; and here I all but lost my life.\r\n\r\nBut I got back to my home at last. On my way there, quite worn out\r\nwith the toils of the boat, I lay down in the shade to rest my limbs,\r\nand slept. But judge, if you can what a start I gave when a voice woke\r\nme out of my sleep, and spoke my name three times! A voice in this\r\nwild place!, To call me by name, too! Then the voice said, "Robin!\r\nRobin Crusoe! Where are you? Where have you been? How came you here?"\r\nBut now I saw it all; for at the top of the hedge sat Poll, who did\r\nbut say the words she had been taught by me.\r\n\r\nI now went in search of some goats, and laid snares for them, with\r\nrice for a bait. I had set the traps in the night, and found they had\r\nstood, though the bait was all gone. So I thought of a new way to take\r\nthem, which was to make a pit and lay sticks and grass on it so as to\r\nhide it; and in this way I caught an old goat and some kids. But the\r\nold goat was much too fierce for me, soy I let him go.\r\n\r\nI brought all the young ones home, and let them fast a long time, till\r\nat last they fed from my hand and were quite tame. I kept them in a\r\nkind of park, in which there were trees to screen them from the sun.\r\nAt first my park was half a mile round; but it struck me that, in so\r\ngreat a space, the kids would soon get as wild as if they had the\r\nrange of the whole vale, and that it would be as well to give them\r\nless room; so I had to make a hedge, which took me three months to\r\nplant. My park held a flock of twelve goats, and in two years time\r\nthere were more than two score.\r\n\r\nMy dog sat at meals with me, and one cat on each side of me, on\r\nstools, and we had Poll to talk to us. Now for a word or two as to the\r\ndress in which I made a tour round the isle. I could but think how\r\ndroll it would look in the streets of the town in which I was born.\r\n\r\nI usually wore a high cap of goatskin, with a long flap that hung down\r\nto keep the sun and rain from my neck, a coat made from the skin of a\r\ngoat, too, the skirts of which came down to my hips, and the same on\r\nmy legs, with no shoes, but flaps of the fur round my shins. I had a\r\nbroad belt of the same around my waist, which drew on with two thongs;\r\nand from it, on my right side; hung a saw and an ax; and on my left\r\nside a pouch for the shot. My beard had not been cut since I came\r\nhere. But no more need be said of my looks, for there were few to see\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW I DISCOVERED A FOOTPRINT AND SAVED FRIDAY\r\n\r\nA strange sight was now in store for me, which was to change the whole\r\ncourse of my life in the isle.\r\n\r\nOne day at noon, while on a stroll down to a part of the shore that\r\nwas new to me, what should I see on the sand but the print of a man\'s\r\nfoot! I felt as if I were bound by a spell, and could not stir from\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by I stole a look around me, but no one was in sight. What\r\ncould this mean? I went three or four times to look at it. There it\r\nwas-the print of a man\'s foot: toes, heel, and all the parts of a\r\nfoot. How could it have come there?\r\n\r\nMy head swam with fear; and as I left the spot, I made two or three\r\nsteps, and then took a look around me; then two steps more, and did\r\nthe same thing. I took fright at the stump of an old tree, and ran to\r\nmy house, as if for my life. How could aught in the shape of a man\r\ncome to that shore, and I not know it? Where was the ship that brought\r\nhim? Then a vague dread took hold of my mind, that some man, or set of\r\nmen, had found me out; and it might be that they meant to kill me, or\r\nrob me of all I had.\r\n\r\nFear kept me indoors for three days, till the want of food drove me\r\nout. At last I was so bold as to go down to the coast to look once\r\nmore at the print of the foot, to see if it was the same shape as my\r\nown. I found it was not so large by a great deal; so it was clear that\r\nit was not one of my own footprints and that there were men in the\r\nisle.\r\n\r\nOne day as I went from the hill to the coast, a scene lay in front of\r\nme which made me sick at heart. The spot was spread with the bones of\r\nmen. There was a round place dug in the earth, where a fire had been\r\nmade, and here some men had come to feast. Now that I had seen this\r\nsight, I knew not how to act; I kept close to my home, and would\r\nscarce stir from it save to milk my flock of goats.\r\n\r\nA few days later I was struck by the sight of some smoke, which came\r\nfrom a fire no more than two miles off. From this time I lost all my\r\npeace of mind. Day and night a dread would haunt me that the men who\r\nhad made this fire would find me out. I went home and drew up my\r\nsteps, but first I made all things round me look wild and rude. To\r\nload my gun was the next thing to do; and I thought it would be best\r\nto stay at home and hide.\r\n\r\nBut this was not to be borne long. I had no spy to send out, and all I\r\ncould do was to get to the top of the hill and keep a good lookout.\r\nAt last, through my glass, I could see a group of wild men join in a\r\ndance round their fire. As soon as they stopped, I took two guns and\r\nslung a sword on my side; then with all speed I set off to the top of\r\nthe hill, once more to have a good view.\r\n\r\nThis time I made up my mind to go up to the men, but not with a view\r\nto kill them, for I felt that it would be wrong to do so. With a heavy\r\nload of arms it took me two hours to reach the spot where the fire\r\nwas; and by the time I got there the men had all gone; but I saw them\r\nin four boats out at sea.\r\n\r\nDown on the shore there was a proof of what the work of these men had\r\nbeen. The signs of their feast made me sick at heart, and I shut my\r\neyes. I durst not fire my gun when I went out for food on that side of\r\nthe isle, lest there should be some of the men left, who might hear\r\nit, and so find me out.\r\n\r\nFrom this time all went well with me for two years; but it was not to\r\nlast. One day, as I stood on the hill, I saw six boats on the shore.\r\nWhat could this mean? Where were the men who had brought them? And\r\nwhat had they come for? I saw through my glass that there were a score\r\nand a half at least on the east side of the isle. They had meat on the\r\nfire, round which I could see them dance. They then took a man from\r\none of the boats, who was bound hand and foot; but when they loosed\r\nhis bonds, he set off as fast as his feet would take him, and in a\r\nstraight line to my house.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, when I saw all the rest of the men run to catch\r\nhim, my hair stood on end with fright. In the creek he swam like a\r\nfish, and the plunge which he took brought him through it in a few\r\nstrokes. All the men now gave up the chase but two, and they swam\r\nthrough the creek, but by no means so fast as the slave had done.\r\n\r\nNow, I thought, was the time to help the poor man, and my heart told\r\nme it would be right to do so. I ran down my steps with my two guns,\r\nand went with all speed up the hill, and then down by a short cut to\r\nmeet them.\r\n\r\nI gave a sign to the poor slave to come to me, and at the same time\r\nwent up to meet the two men who were in chase of him. I made a rush at\r\nthe first of these, to knock him down with the stock of my gun, and he\r\nfell. I saw the one who was left aim at me with his bow; so, to save\r\nmy life, I aimed carefully and shot him dead.\r\n\r\nThe smoke and noise from my gun gave the poor slave who had been bound\r\nsuch a shock that he stood still on the spot, as if he had been in a\r\ntrance. I gave a loud shout for him to come to me, and I took care to\r\nshow him that I was a friend, and made all the signs I could think\r\nof to coax him up to me. At length he came, knelt down to kiss the\r\nground, and then took hold of my foot and set it on his head. All this\r\nmeant that he was my slave; and I bade him rise and made much of him.\r\n\r\nI did not like to take my slave to my house, or to my cave; so I threw\r\ndown some straw from the rice plant for him to sleep on, and gave him\r\nsome bread and a bunch of dry grapes to eat. He was a fine man, with\r\nstraight, strong limbs, tall and young. His hair was thick, like wool,\r\nand black. His head was large and high, and he had bright black eyes.\r\nHe was of a dark-brown hue; his face was round and his nose small, but\r\nnot flat; he had a good mouth with thin lips, with which he could give\r\na soft smile; and his teeth were as white as snow.\r\n\r\nToward evening I had been out to milk my goats, and when he saw me, he\r\nran to me and lay down-on the ground to show me his thanks. He then\r\nput his head on the ground and set my foot on his head, as he had done\r\nat first. He took all the means he could think of to let me know\r\nthat he would serve me all his life; and I gave a sign to make him\r\nunderstand that I thought well of him.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to think of some name to call him by. I chose that\r\nof the sixth day of the week, Friday, as he came to me on that day. I\r\ntook care not to lose sight of him all that night. When the sun rose,\r\nwe event up to the top of the hill to look out for the men; but as we\r\ncould not see them or their boats, it was clear that they had left the\r\nisle.\r\n\r\nI now set to work to make my man a cap of hare\'s skin, and gave him a\r\ngoat\'s skin to wear round his waist. It was a great source of pride to\r\nhim to find that his clothes were as good as my own.\r\n\r\nAt night I kept my guns, swords, and bow close to my side; but there\r\nwas no need for this, as my slave was, in sooth, most true to me. He\r\ndid all that he was set to do, with his whole heart in the work; and I\r\nknew that he would lay down his life to save mine. What could a man do\r\nmore than that? And oh, the joy to have him here to cheer me in this\r\nlone isle!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW FRIDAY LEARNED MY WAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nI did my best to teach him, so like a child he was, to do and feel all\r\nthat was right. I found him apt and full of fun; and he took great\r\npains to understand and learn all that I could tell him.\r\n\r\nOne day I sent him to beat out and sift some grain. I let him see me\r\nmake the bread, and he soon did all the work. I felt quite a love for\r\nhis true, warm heart, and he soon learned to talk to me. One day I\r\nsaid, "Do the men of your tribe win in fight?" He told me, with a\r\nsmile, that they did. "Well, then," said I, "how came they to let\r\ntheir foes take you?"\r\n\r\n"They run one, two, three, and make go in the boat that time."\r\n\r\n"Well, and what do the men do with those they take?"\r\n\r\n"Eat them all up."\r\n\r\nThis was not good news for me, but I went on, and said, "Where do they\r\ntake them?"\r\n\r\n"Go to next place where they think."\r\n\r\n"Do they come here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, they come here, come else place, too."\r\n\r\n"Have you been here with them twice?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, come there."\r\n\r\nHe meant the northwest side of the isle, so to this spot I took him\r\nthe next day. He knew the place, and told me he was there once, and\r\nwith him twelve men. To let me know this, he placed twelve stones all\r\nin a row, and made me count them.\r\n\r\n"Are not the boats lost on your shore now and then?"\r\n\r\nHe said that there was no fear, and that no boats were lost. He told\r\nme that up a great way by the moon--that is, where the moon then came\r\nup--there dwelt a tribe of white men like me, with beards. I felt sure\r\nthat they must have come from Spain, to work the gold mines. I put\r\nthis to him: "Could I go from this isle and join those men?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, you may go in two boats."\r\n\r\nIt was hard to see how one man could go in two boats, but what he\r\nmeant was a boat twice as large as my own.\r\n\r\nTo please my poor slave, I gave him a sketch of my whole life; I told\r\nhim where I was born and where I spent my days when a child. He was\r\nglad to hear tales of the land of my birth, and of the trade which we\r\nkept up, in ships, with all parts of the known world. I gave him a\r\nknife and a belt, which made him dance with joy.\r\n\r\nOne day as we stood on the top of the hill at the east side of the\r\nisle, I saw him fix his eyes on the mainland, and stand for a long\r\ntime gazing at it; then jump and sing, and call out to me.\r\n\r\n"What do you see?" said I.\r\n\r\n"O joy!" said he, with a fierce glee in his eyes, "O glad! There see\r\nmy land!"\r\n\r\nWhy did he strain his eyes to stare at this land as if he had a wish\r\nto be there? It put fears in my mind which made me feel far less at my\r\nease with him. Thought I, if he should go back to his home, he will\r\nthink no more of what I have taught him and done for him. He will be\r\nsure to tell the rest of his tribe all my ways, and come back with, it\r\nmay be, scores of them, and kill me, and then dance round me, as they\r\ndid round the men, the last time they came on my isle.\r\n\r\nBut these were all false fears, though they found a place in my mind\r\nfor a long while; and I was not so kind to him now as I had been. From\r\nthis time I made it a rule, day by day, to find out if there were\r\ngrounds for my fears or not. I said, "Do you wish to be once more in\r\nyour own land?"\r\n\r\n"Yes! I be much O glad to be at my own land."\r\n\r\n"What would you do there? Would you turn wild, and be as you were?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, I would tell them to be good, tell them eat bread, grain,\r\nmilk, no eat man more!"\r\n\r\n"Why, they would kill you!"\r\n\r\n"No, no, they no kill; they love learn."\r\n\r\nHe then told me that some white men who had come on their shores in a\r\nboat had taught them a great deal.\r\n\r\n"Then will you go back to your land with me?"\r\n\r\nHe said he could not swim so far, so I told him he should help me to\r\nbuild a boat to go in. Then he said, "If you go, I go."\r\n\r\n"I go? Why, they would eat me!"\r\n\r\n"No, me make them much love you."\r\n\r\nThen he told me, as well as he could, how kind they had been to some\r\nwhite men. I brought out the large boat to hear what he thought of it,\r\nbut he said it was too small. We then went to look at the old ship\'s\r\nboat, which, as it had been in the sun for years, was not at all in a\r\nsound state. The poor man made sure that it would do. But how were we\r\nto know this? I told him we should build a boat as large as that, and\r\nthat he should go home in it. He spoke not a word, but was grave and\r\nsad.\r\n\r\n"What ails you?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Why you grieve mad with your man?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? I am not cross with you."\r\n\r\n"No cross? No cross with me? Why send your man home to his own land,\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"Did you not tell me you would like to go back?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, we both there; no wish self there, if you not there!"\r\n\r\n"And what should I do there?"\r\n\r\n"You do great deal much good! You teach wild men be good men."\r\n\r\nWe soon set to work to make a boat that would take us both. The first\r\nthing was to look out for some large tree that grew near the shore, so\r\nthat we could launch our boat when it was made. My slave\'s plan was to\r\nburn the wood to make it the right shape; but as mine was to hew it, I\r\nset him to work with my tools, and in two months\' time we had made a\r\ngood, strong boat; but it took a long while to get her down to the\r\nshore and float her.\r\n\r\nFriday had the whole charge of her; and, large as she was, he made her\r\nmove with ease, and said, "Me think she go there well, though great\r\nblow wind!" He did not know that I meant to make a mast and sail. I\r\ncut down a young fir tree for the mast, and then I set to work at the\r\nsail. It made me laugh to see my man stand and stare, when he came to\r\nwatch me sail the boat. But he soon gave a jump, a laugh, and a clap\r\nof the hands when for the first time he saw the sail jib and fall, now\r\non this side, now on that.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to do was to stow our boat up in the creek, where we\r\ndug a small dock; and when the tide was low, we made a dam to keep out\r\nthe sea. The time of year had now come for us to set sail, so we got\r\nout all our stores to put them into the boat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH SHIP AND HOW I SAILED FOR HOME\r\n\r\nI was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man Friday came\r\nrunning in to me and called aloud, "Master, master, they are come,\r\nthey are come!" I jumped up and went out, as soon as I could get my\r\nclothes on, through my little grove, which, by the way, was by this\r\ntime grown to be a very thick wood. I went without my arms, which was\r\nnot my custom; but I was surprised when, turning my eyes to the sea, I\r\nsaw a boat at about a league and a half distance, standing in for the\r\nshore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind\r\nblowing pretty fair to bring them in; also I saw that they did not\r\ncome from that side which the shore lay on, but from the south end of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nUpon this I hastily called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for we\r\ndid not know yet whether they were friends or enemies. In the next\r\nplace, I went in to fetch my glass, to see what I could make of them;\r\nand, having climbed up to the top of the hill, I saw a ship lying at\r\nanchor, at about two leagues from me, but not above a league and a\r\nhalf from the shore. It seemed to be an English ship, and the boat\r\nlooked like an English longboat.\r\n\r\nThey ran their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from\r\nme; which was very happy for me, else they would have landed just at\r\nmy door, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me out of my caste,\r\nand perhaps have plundered me of all I had. When they were on shore,\r\nI saw they were Englishmen; there were, in all, eleven men, whereof\r\nthree of them I found were unarmed, and, as I thought, bound; and when\r\nthe first four or five of them had jumped on shore, they took those\r\nthree out of the boat as prisoners; one of the three I could see using\r\nthe gestures of entreaty and despair; the other two, I could see,\r\nlifted up their hands and appeared concerned, but not to such a degree\r\nas the first.\r\n\r\nI was shocked and terrified at the sight of all this and knew not what\r\nthe meaning of it could be. Friday called out to me in English, as\r\nwell as he could, "O master! you see English mans eat prisoner as well\r\nas savage mans." "Why, Friday," said I, "do you think they are going\r\nto eat them, then?" "Yes," said Friday, "they will eat them." "No,\r\nno," said I, "Friday, I am afraid they will murder them indeed; but\r\nyou may be sure they will not eat them."\r\n\r\nI expected every minute to see the three prisoners killed, so I fitted\r\nmyself up for a battle, though with much caution, knowing that I had\r\nto do with another kind of enemy than if I were fighting savages.\r\nI ordered Friday also to load himself with arms. I took myself two\r\nfowling pieces, and I gave him two muskets. My figure was very fierce;\r\nI had my goatskin coat on, with the great cap, a naked sword, two\r\npistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was my design not to make any attempt till it was dark; but about\r\ntwo o\'clock, being the heat of the day, I found, in short, they had\r\nall gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought, had all lain\r\ndown to sleep. The three poor, distressed men, too anxious for their\r\ncondition to get any sleep, had, however, sat down under the shelter\r\nof a great tree.\r\n\r\nI resolved to discover myself to them, and learn something of their\r\ncondition; immediately I marched toward them, my man Friday at a good\r\ndistance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making\r\nquite so staring a specter-like figure as I did. I came as near them\r\nundiscovered as I could, and then, before any of them saw me, I called\r\naloud to them in Spanish, "Who are ye, sirs?"\r\n\r\nThey gave a start at my voice and at my strange dress, and made a move\r\nas if they would flee from me. I said, ``Do not fear me, for it may be\r\nthat you have a friend at hand, though you do not think it." "He must\r\nbe sent from the sky, then," said one of them with a grave look; and\r\nhe took off his hat to me at the same time. "All help is from thence,\r\nsir," I said. "But what can I do to aid you? You look as if you had\r\nsome load of grief on your breast. A moment ago I saw one of the men\r\nlift his sword as if to kill you."\r\n\r\nThe tears ran down the poor man\'s face as he said, "Is this a god, or\r\nis it but a man?" "Have no doubt on that score, sir," said I, "for a\r\ngod would not have come with a dress like this. No, do not fear-nor\r\nraise your hopes too high; for you see but a man, yet one who will do\r\nall he can to help you. Your speech shows me that you come from the\r\nsame land as I do. I will do all I can to serve you. Tell me your\r\ncase."\r\n\r\n"Our case, sir, is too long to tell you while they who would kill us\r\nare so near. My name is Paul. To be short, sir, my crew have thrust me\r\nout of my ship, which you see out there, and have left me here to die.\r\nIt was as much as I could do to make them sheathe their swords, which\r\nyou saw were drawn to slay me. They have set me down in this isle with\r\nthese two men, my friend here, and the ship\'s mate."\r\n\r\n"Where have they gone?" said I.\r\n\r\n"There, in the wood close by. I fear they may have seen and heard us.\r\nIf they have, they will be sure to kill us all."\r\n\r\n"Have they firearms?"\r\n\r\n"They have four guns, one of which is in the boat."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, leave all to me!"\r\n\r\n"There are two of the men," said he, "who are worse than the rest. All\r\nbut these I feel sure would go back to work the ship."\r\n\r\nI thought it was best to speak out to Paul at once, and\r\n\r\nI said, "Now if I save your life, there are two things which you must\r\ndo."\r\n\r\nBut he read my thoughts, and said, "If you save my life, you shall do\r\nas you like with me and my ship, and take her where you please."\r\n\r\nI saw that the two men, in whose charge the boat had been left, had\r\ncome on shore; so the first thing I did was to send Friday to fetch\r\nfrom it the oars, the sail, and the gun. And now the ship might be\r\nsaid to be in our hands. When the time came for the men to go back to\r\nthe ship, they were in a great rage; for, as the boat had now no sail\r\nor oars, they knew not how to get out to their ship.\r\n\r\nWe heard them say that it was a strange sort of isle, for sprites had\r\ncome to the boat, to take off the sails and oars. W e could see them\r\nrun to and fro, with great rage; then go and sit in the boat to rest,\r\nand then come on shore once more. When they drew near to us, Paul and\r\nFriday would fain have had me fall on them at once. But my wish was to\r\nspare them, and kill as few as possible. I told two of my men to creep\r\non their hands and knees close to the ground so that they might not be\r\nseen, and when they got \'up to the men, not to fire till I gave the\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThey had not stood thus long when three of the crew came up to us.\r\nTill now we had but heard their voices, but when they came so near as\r\nto be seen, Paul and Friday shot at them. Two of the men fell dead,\r\nand they were the worst of the crew, and the third ran off. At the\r\nsound of the guns I came up, but it was so dark that the men could not\r\ntell if there were three of us or three score.\r\n\r\nIt fell out just as I wished, for I heard the men ask: "To whom must\r\nwe yield, and where are they?" Friday told them that Paul was there\r\nwith the king of the isle, who had brought with him a crowd of men!\r\nAt this, one of the crew said: "If Paul will spare our lives, we will\r\nyield." "Then," said Friday, "you shall know the king\'s will." Then\r\nPaul said to them: "You know my voice; if you lay down your arms, the\r\nking will spare your lives."\r\n\r\nThey fell on their knees to beg the same of me. I took good care that\r\nthey did not see me, but I gave them my word that they should all\r\nlive, that I should take four of them to work the ship, and that the\r\nrest would be bound hand and foot for the good faith of the four. This\r\nwas to show them what a stern king I was.\r\n\r\nOf course I soon set them free, and I put them in a way to take my\r\nplace on the isle. I told them of all my ways, taught them how to mind\r\nthe goats, how to work the farm, and how to make the bread. I gave\r\nthem a house to live in, firearms, tools and my two tame cats-in fact,\r\nall that I owned but Poll and my gold.\r\n\r\nAs I sat on the top of the hill, Paul came up to me. He held out his\r\nhand to point to the ship, and with much warmth took me to his arms\r\nand said: "My dear friend, there is your ship! For this vessel is all\r\nyours, and all that is in her, and so are all of us."\r\n\r\nI made ready to go on board the ship, but told the captain I would\r\nstay that night to get my things in shape, and asked him to go on\r\nboard in the meantime and keep things right on the ship.\r\n\r\nI cast my eyes to the ship, which rode half a mile off the shore, at\r\nthe mouth of the creek, and near the place where I had brought my raft\r\nto the land. Yes, there she stood, the ship that was to set me free\r\nand to take hie where I might choose to go. She set her sails to the\r\nwind, and her flags threw out their gay stripes in the breeze. Such a\r\nsight was too much for me, and I fell down faint with joy.\r\n\r\nFriday and Paul then went on board the ship, and Paul took charge of\r\nher once more. We did not start that night, but at noon the next day I\r\nleft the isle-that lone isle, where I had spent so great a part of my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhen I took leave of this island, I carried on board a great goatskin\r\ncap I had made, and my parrot; also the money which had lain by me so\r\nlong useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly\r\npass for gold till it had been a little rubbed and handled. And thus I\r\nleft the island, the nineteenth of December, as I found by the ship\'s\r\naccount, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it seven-and-twenty\r\nyears, two months, and nineteen days. In this vessel, after a long\r\nvoyage, I arrived in England the eleventh of June, in the year 1687.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nBiography. Daniel Defoe (1659-1731), an English author, was born in\r\nLondon. He was well educated and devoted himself chiefly to writing.\r\nHe was active in political life, and many of his early pamphlets were\r\nattacks upon the government. Robinson Crusoe, his greatest story, is\r\na world classic. It is founded mainly on the adventures of Alexander\r\nSelkirk, who told Defoe about his own experiences as a castaway on\r\nan island. Defoe tells his story in simple, direct language, with\r\nfrequent use of details and illustrations.\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1. Why was an ocean voyage so difficult and dangerous at\r\nthe time when Robinson Crusoe was written? 2. Find the lines that\r\ndescribe what you think was the most difficult work undertaken by\r\nRobinson Crusoe. 3. What under king required the most perseverance?\r\nFind lines that show this. 4. At what time did Crusoe show the\r\ngreatest courage? Find lines that seem to yore to prove your answer is\r\ncorrect. 5. What was the greatest disappointment that he had to bear\r\nwhile on the island? 6. What do you think was the greatest happiness\r\nhe had? 7. Find lines that tell how Robinson Crusoe studied to make\r\nsomething which was very necessary to him. 8. Mention something he\r\nmade that you have tried to make. 9. How did your result compare with\r\nhis? What reason can you give for this? 10. This story shows how\r\ndependent we are upon the tools, the inventions, and the means of\r\nprotection that men have devised for making life happy. Crusoe had to\r\nmake for himself under great difficulties things that we think nothing\r\nof. Show from the story how dependent we are upon the cooperation and\r\nassistance of others. Imagine the cooperation that has been necessary\r\nto give you milk, oranges or bananas, sugar for your dessert, meat for\r\nyour dinner. What has been done to give you the stove on which your\r\ndinner is cooked, the fuel that it burns, the light that you use at\r\nnight, the telephone that you use? Crusoe had to get along without\r\nsuch assistance. Do you owe anything, any return service, for what\r\nyou receive and use? If Crusoe\'s hut had taken fire, what would have\r\nhappened? What would happen if your home should catch fire? Who would\r\npay for the help given you? If Crusoe had been attacked by robbers,\r\nwhat would have happened? What keeps you safe at night? If Crusoe had\r\nwished to go on a long journey, what would have been necessary? Who\r\nwould help you if you had to take such a journey? 12. Tell a story\r\nabout your debt to someone for an invention or discovery that makes\r\nyour life pleasanter or safer. Tell a story about your debt for the\r\nsugar you use for your desert. Tell a story to illustrate what the\r\ngovernment does for you. 13. Class readings: Select passages to be\r\nread aloud in class. 14. Outline for testing silent reading. Tell the\r\nstory briefly in your own words, using the topic headings given in\r\nthe book. 15. You will enjoy seeing the pictures in the edition of\r\nRobinson Crusoe that is illustrated by N. C. Wyeth. 16. Find in the\r\nGlossary the meaning of: stern; bulge; spikes; adz; limes; mute;\r\nleague; thong; fowling; piece. 17. Pronounce: pursuit; swoon;\r\nspars; drought;; sieve; launch; cruise; shoal; tour; jib; gesture;\r\nformidable; sheathe; sprites.\r\n\r\nPhrases for Study lee of the land, in sooth, spare yards, I found him\r\napt, O drug, standing in for the shore, give me thought for thought,\r\nappeared concerned, whole round of my isle, discover myself to them,\r\nbound by a spell, specter-like figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORIES OF ADVENTURE\r\n\r\nA BACKWARD LOOK\r\n\r\nNow that you have read all of these tales of adventure, perhaps some\r\nevening you will curl up in that big chair in a cozy place and will\r\nclose your eyes and dream a dream. And in that dream you will see-who\r\nknows? Ali Baba and Aladdin in their queer dress, and Sindbad, the\r\nrich old sailor, and Captain Lemuel Gulliver, and Robin Hood in his\r\nLincoln green, and Robinson Crusoe with his man Friday. All of them\r\nwill sit down near you, between you and the fire perhaps, and they\r\nwill talk to each other about the meaning of all the perils and\r\nsuccesses that life brought them. And you will doubtless get the\r\nidea from them all that every man, rich or poor, ought to feel some\r\nresponsibility to others. Ali Baba and Aladdin and Sindbad will tell\r\nthe company, there in the firelight before your very eyes, how they\r\nfelt that they owed something to\' others because of the wealth they\r\nhad, gained. Aladdin became a serious and public-spirited man, though\r\nas a boy he had been of little worth. Ali Baba and Sindbad helped\r\nothers and did many good deeds.\r\n\r\nThen Robin Hood will join in the conversation. He lived in a time, as\r\nyou can see from his story, when the poor not only had no chance but\r\nwere oppressed. Robin tried to do away with some of this injustice.\r\nHe was an outlaw; he did many things that it would not be right to\r\ndo today; but he did these things in order to help people who were\r\nwretched and who had no chance.\r\n\r\nAnd next, Robinson Crusoe has a word to say. His experience, he tells\r\nus, showed him how much we depend on each other. If a man is suddenly\r\ncut off from his fellows, has to get his own food or starve, build his\r\nown house with his own rude tools or freeze, he finds out how much he\r\nowes to the cooperation of thousands of other people.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, Captain Gulliver, who has been listening quietly for a\r\nlong time, knocks the ashes from his pipe as he gets up to go, and\r\nsays: "You know, it all comes down to this: can a man or a nation\r\nstand being rich and strong? You know those Lilliputians, when they\r\nconquered the people of Blefuscu, wanted right away to annex the lands\r\nof their enemies. They had no right to the lands; they had enough of\r\ntheir own; if I had let them do what they planned, they would have\r\nmade many people very miserable, But the moment they saw a chance to\r\ngrab something, they wanted to go right after it.. And it makes me\r\nwonder about this America that is so much discussed just now. In my\r\nday we scarcely knew there was such a country, but you know how strong\r\nand prosperous the Americans are, and what a war they can fight, and\r\nhow many rich men they have. They seem to me to have found that lamp\r\nand ring that friend Aladdin once had; everything they touch seems to\r\nturn to gold, and they can build a city over night. I just wonder what\r\nthey will do with all this power?"\r\n\r\nAnd they all shake their heads, as if to say that they wonder, too.\r\nAnd the fire has grown lower and lower, so that you can hardly see the\r\nstrange forms.--And then father calls to you to wake up and get your\r\nlesson or go to bed, and they all vanish at the sound of that voice.\r\n\r\nHow would you answer Captain Gulliver\'s question about America? What\r\ndid America do with its power in the World War? What good American\r\ncitizens that you know of have used their wealth to found libraries,\r\nhospitals, parks, and other public benefits? Show that boys and girls\r\njoin together in teamwork for the good of all by organizing clubs,\r\nBoy Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, Junior Red Cross, etc. Mention kinds of\r\nservice these organizations give for the good of all. Show that each\r\nof the six stories in Part II has the two values mentioned in the\r\nfirst paragraph on page 146. Which story did you enjoy most? Which\r\ngave you the most worth-while ideas? What gains have you made in your\r\nability to read silently with speed and understanding?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT AMERICAN AUTHORS\r\n\r\nA man lives in the last half of life on the memory of things read in\r\nthe first half of life.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT AMERICAN AUTHORS\r\n\r\nA FORWARD LOOK\r\n\r\nWhen Mother used to tell you a story about when she was a little girl,\r\nyou were interested only in the story and in the pictures her words\r\ncalled up in your mind. Suppose some older person had been listening\r\nwhile she told one of these tales, and had been interested not alone\r\nin the adventure that she was telling about, as you were, but in the\r\nway in which she told it. This person, your uncle, let\'s say, would\r\nnotice how Mother planned her story so as to keep the very most\r\nexciting thing to the last, and how you grew more and more excited\r\nabout it, and how your eyes shone, and her eyes too, and how without\r\nknowing it she was letting him see what kind of people they were\r\nin her story, and what kind of little girl she was-very brave,\r\nyou know-and when at the end you drew a long breath and had that\r\ndelightful little thrill that you always have at the end of a\r\nperfectly wonderful story-after all this, suppose your uncle should\r\nlook at Mother in a funny kind of way and should say, "Bless me, Sis,\r\nI had no idea you were an author."\r\n\r\nWhat would you say? Mother an author? Why, an author is a person who\r\nwrites big books in words that no one can understand, but Mother,\r\nshe-why, she is Mother!\r\n\r\nYet your uncle is right. Mother is an author when she thinks back over\r\nher life and picks out something that is interesting, and then tells\r\nit in her very most interesting way to please you. If she would only\r\nwrite out that story, and a printer would print it in a book, and in\r\nthe front of the book you should read "When I Was a Little Girl." By\r\nMother"-that would be a Book, and Mother would be a real author.\r\n\r\nNow long, long ago, there weren\'t any books. When Mother told you a\r\nstory, if you had lived then, you would remember it and would tell\r\nit to other people, and after you grew up you would tell it to your\r\nchildren, and when they had grown up, they would tell it to your\r\ngrandchildren, and so on and on. Who wrote Cinderella, or Sleeping\r\nBeauty, or the Three Bears? You don\'t know. Nobody knows. They just\r\nhappened. They were told by mothers to their children and so on and\r\nso on, and after centuries, perhaps, when printing had been invented,\r\nsome printer man thought, like your uncle, that here was a story that\r\nought to be printed and so he made a book of it. But he didn\'t claim\r\nto be the author of it, for he was not.\r\n\r\nSo, some of the stories you have read in this book do not have any\r\nauthor\'s name attached to them. And even if they did, you were not\r\nthinking, while you were reading, about the man who wrote them. You\r\njust thought of the story and whether you liked it or not. Yet no\r\nsmall part of the advantage that you enjoy because you live now,\r\ninstead of in the days when there were no books, lies in the fact that\r\nyou can become acquainted with the men and women who have written the\r\nstories and poems that you read.\r\n\r\nLet\'s put it this way. In those old days that we have been speaking\r\nabout, you would have had to depend upon your Mother, or some other\r\nmother, or some village weaver of tales, for your stories. But they\r\nwere busy, and you couldn\'t get enough stories to satisfy your\r\nappetite. Then one-time, let\'s say, a strange, wandering fellow came\r\nto your village. And he had yards and yards of the most wonderful\r\nstories to tell. And he went home with you, let\'s say, and stayed\r\nthere, and did nothing but tell you stories whenever you wanted them,\r\nfirst thing in the morning, and after school, and bedtime, and all.\r\nAnd he was never too busy. And you learned to know him, what an\r\ninteresting man he was, and what fine eyes he had, and what a smile\r\nthat made you smile back before he said a word, and how he loved Truth\r\nand hated lies, and loved Honor and hated shameful things. He was your\r\nauthor, your book, your book of books. And he was as dear to you, in\r\nhimself, as his stories were.\r\n\r\nNow you can have just such a friend, no, you can have a whole company\r\nof just such friends, for yourself. How? In books, of course. Only\r\nthey won\'t be merely books; they will be friends. Washington Irving,\r\nteller of wonderful stories, and Robert Louis Stevenson are there,\r\nin those books, and you can learn them as well as their stories. And\r\nHenry W. Longfellow, writer of stories in verse; and John G. Whittier,\r\nwriter of poems about barefoot boys and corn huskings; and Benjamin\r\nFranklin, a kindly philosopher-there, that word is too hard for you,\r\nbut it just slipped out, and so you will have to be told that a\r\nphilosopher is a person who thinks about life and its meaning.\r\n\r\nThat\'s what all authors are, in a way. That\'s what makes them authors.\r\nThey don\'t just eat and sleep and do their work, whatever it is-they\r\nthink about life. And what they see and think they set down for you.\r\nTo know them is to know delightful friends who will tell you what\r\neverything means and will answer all your questions.\r\n\r\nThere they are, on your bookshelf. They won\'t speak to you unless you\r\nspeak first. If you want to do something else and don\'t wish to be\r\nbothered, they won\'t bother you. But when you want to talk with them,\r\nthey are ready. Call upon them often, and you will learn one of the\r\nblessedest things about life, the companionship of boobs.\r\n\r\nSome of them, men of our own America, are to be introduced to you in\r\nthe following pages. From now on you are to do three things. First,\r\nyou are to listen and enjoy when they tell you what they have to say.\r\nNext, you are to begin to do just what your uncle was doing when he\r\nlistened to Mother telling you that story-you are to see that there is\r\na way to tell something that is good, and that if one has learned this\r\nway, like Mother, he is an author. And last, you are to find that\r\nthese authors are real persons whom you can learn to know. Then you\r\nwill love them, just as you love Mother, not alone for what they say,\r\nbut for what they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin (1706-1790) was born in Boston in the early colonial\r\ndays. While still a boy, he learned the printer\'s trade, but,\r\nhaving difficulty with his brother, for whom he worked, he went\r\nto Philadelphia,-where later he became owner and editor of the\r\nPhiladelphia Gazette, the city\'s leading newspaper. Later he\r\nestablished another periodical, called Poor Richard\'s Almanac.\r\n\r\nFranklin was greatly interested in the study of science. He "snatched\r\nlightning from the skies" by the use of a key and a kite with a silk\r\nstring. This experiment led to his invention of the lightning rod,\r\nwhich was soon placed on public and private buildings not only in\r\nAmerica but also in England and France. He invented the "Franklin\r\nStove," which is still in use in some places. This is an open stove\r\nmade in such a way as to economize heat and save fuel. Franklin\r\ninvented a street lamp which was used for lighting the streets of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nFranklin was big-hearted and wished to be of real service to his\r\nfellow-citizens. He organized a debating club, a night watch, a\r\nvolunteer fire company, a street-cleaning department, and a public\r\nlibrary-the first of its kind in America.\r\n\r\nHis-services to the new government that the Americans were just\r\nsetting up were equally noteworthy. He went to England to represent\r\nthe colonies and did all that he could to patch up the quarrel between\r\nthe colonies and the mother country. When all these attempts failed,\r\nhe gave himself heart and soul to the business of making a new\r\ngovernment. He was one of the signers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Later, as a special minister to France he delighted\r\nFrenchmen by his humor and his common sense, and he even succeeded\r\nin securing the promise of the French government to acknowledge the\r\nindependence of the colonies and to send ships and men to their\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to a friend in 1779, Franklin tells the story, "The\r\nWhistle." "An Ax to Grind" is from his autobiography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHISTLE\r\n\r\nWhen I was a child seven years old, my friends on a holiday filled my\r\npocket with coppers. I went directly to a shop where they sold toys\r\nfor children, and, being charmed with the sound of a whistle that I\r\nmet by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered and\r\ngave all my money for one. I then ran home and went whistling all\r\nover the house, much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing all the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nMy brothers and sisters and cousins, understanding the bargain I had\r\nmade, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth;\r\nput me in mind what good things I might have bought with the rest of\r\nthe money; and laughed at me so much for my folly that I cried with\r\nvexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle\r\ngave me pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was afterwards of use to me, the impression continuing\r\non my mind; so that often when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary\r\nthing, I said to myself, "Don\'t give too much for the whistle";\' and I\r\nsaved my money.\r\n\r\nAs I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, I\r\nthought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for the whistle.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw one too ambitious of court favor, sacrificing his time in\r\nattendance on levees-his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps\r\nhis friends, to attain it-I have said to myself, "This man gives too\r\nmuch for his whistle."\r\n\r\nWhen I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employing himself\r\nin political bustles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by\r\nthat neglect, "He pays indeed," said I, "too much for his whistle."\r\n\r\nIf I knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living, all\r\nthe pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his fellow\r\ncitizens, and the joys of benevolent friendship, for the sake of\r\naccumulating wealth, "Poor man," said I, "you pay too much for your\r\nwhistle."\r\n\r\nWhen I met with a man of pleasure, sacrificing every laudable\r\nimprovement of the mind or of his fortune to mere corporeal\r\nsensations, and ruining his health in their pursuit, "Mistaken man,"\r\nsaid I, "you are providing pain for yourself instead of pleasure; you\r\ngive too much for your whistle."\r\n\r\nIf I see one fond of appearance, or fine clothes, fine houses, fine\r\nfurniture, fine equipages, all above his fortune, for which he\r\ncontracts debts and ends his career in a prison, "Alas!" say I, "he\r\nhas paid dear, very dear, for his whistle."\r\n\r\nIn short, I conceive that a great part of the miseries of mankind are\r\nbrought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value\r\nof things, and by their giving too much for their whistles.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1. Why did Franklin say that lie paid too much for his\r\nwhistle\' 2. How was this incident of use to him afterwards? 3. How\r\ndoes it apply to a man too fond of popularity? To the miser?

"My pretty boy,"\r\nsaid he, "has your father a grindstone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said I.\r\n\r\n"You are a fine little fellow!" said he. "Will you, let me grind my ax\r\non it?"\r\n\r\nPleased with the compliment of "fine little fellow," "Oh, yes, sir," I\r\nanswered. "It is down in the shop."\r\n\r\n"And will you, my man," said he, patting me on the head, "get me a\r\nlittle hot water?"\r\n\r\nHow could I refuse? I ran, and soon brought a kettleful.\r\n\r\n"How old are you-and what\'s your name?" continued he, without waiting\r\nfor a reply. "I\'m sure you are one of the finest lads that I have ever\r\nseen. Will you just turn a few minutes for me?"\r\n\r\nTickled with the flattery, like a little fool, I went to work, and\r\nbitterly did I rue the day. It was a new ax, and I toiled and tugged\r\ntill I was almost tired to death. The school bell rang, and I could\r\nnot get away. My hands were blistered, and the ax was not half ground.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, it was sharpened, and the man turned to me with,\r\n"Now, you little rascal, you\'ve played truant! Scud to school, or\r\nyou\'ll rue it!"\r\n\r\n"Alas!" thought I, "it was hard enough to turn a grindstone this cold\r\nday, but now to be called a little rascal is too much." It sank deep\r\ninto my mind, and often have I thought of it since.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

Pronounce:\r\naccosted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT\r\n\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant (1794-1878) was born in the rugged hill country\r\nof western Massachusetts. From infancy he showed remarkable powers of\r\nmind. He could read by the time he was two years old, wrote verses\r\nat nine, and when scarcely eighteen wrote his most noted poem,\r\n"Thanatopsis," now one of the world\'s classics. He had a wonderful\r\nmemory, and it is said he could repeat "by heart" every poem he had\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nBryant removed to New York, where in 1825 he became editor of the\r\nEvening Post. Through the remainder of--his long life he devoted his\r\nenergy and great gifts to building up one of the most forceful of\r\nAmerican newspapers, but he found time also to study Nature and to\r\nwrite so many poems that we now think of him as a poet, not as an\r\neditor. He was also a student, and we are indebted to him for some\r\nexcellent translations from old authors. And, finally, he was a\r\npublic-spirited American, interested in all matters that have to do\r\nwith the honor of our country. Imagine yourself in New York City\r\nduring the latter part of the last century. If you were walking up\r\nBroadway almost any morning, your attention would be attracted to a\r\nvenerable looking man, with heavy, flowing, snow-white hair and beard,\r\nwhom you would be quite likely to meet swinging along at a vigorous\r\npace. You would not need to be told that this man is our first\r\nAmerican poet, with whose verses you are already familiar; and you\r\nwould probably know, too, that he is also the editor of the Evening\r\nPost and that, although now past eighty, he is on his way to his\r\noffice, walking from his home some two miles away, as he has done,\r\nrain or shine, for over half a century.\r\n\r\nThis great man was not too busy with affairs, or too learned, to look\r\nfor the joy that comes from companionship with Nature. Like Irving he\r\nchose American subjects taken from his own surroundings: the scenes\r\nof his boyhood, the flowers, birds, and hills of his old New England\r\nhome. He found pleasure in the simplest things, and he wrote about\r\nthis pleasure in the simplest way. In this simplicity and the variety\r\nof his interests his wealth consisted; a treasure that made rich not\r\nonly the poet who possessed it but all Americans, to whom he left his\r\nlife and works for an inheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW VIOLET\r\n\r\n    When beechen buds begin to swell,\r\n    And woods the bluebird\'s warble know,\r\n    The yellow violet\'s modest bell\r\n    Peeps from the last year\'s leaves below.\r\n\r\n    Ere russet fields their green resume,\r\n    Sweet flower, I love, in forest bare,\r\n    To meet thee, when thy faint perfume;\r\n    Alone is in the virgin air.\r\n\r\n    Of all her train, the hands of Spring\r\n    First plant thee in the watery mold;\r\n    And I have seen thee blossoming\r\n    Beside the snow-bank\'s edges cold.\r\n\r\n    Thy parent sun, who bade thee view\r\n    dale-skies, and chilling moisture sip,\r\n    Has bathed thee in his own bright hue,\r\n    And streaked with jet thy glowing lip.\r\n\r\n    Yet slight thy form, and low thy seat,\r\n    And earthward bent thy gentle eye,\r\n    Unapt the passing view to meet,\r\n    When loftier flowers are flaunting nigh.\r\n\r\n    Oft, in the sunless April day,\r\n    Thy early smile has stayed my walk,\r\n    But \'midst the gorgeous blooms of May\r\n    I passed thee on thy humble stalk.\r\n\r\nSo they who climb to wealth forget The friends in darker fortunes\r\ntried. I copied them--but I regret That I should ape the ways of\r\npride.\r\n\r\nAnd when again the genial hour Awakes the painted tribes of light,\r\nI\'ll not o\'erlook the modest flower That made the weds of April\r\nbright.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

He had\r\nvery little opportunity for education beyond what the district school\r\nafforded, for his parents were too poor to send him away to school.\r\nHis two years\' attendance at Haverhill Academy was paid for by his own\r\nwork at making ladies\' slippers for twenty-five cents a pair. He began\r\nwriting verses almost as soon as he learned to write at all, but his\r\nfather discouraged this ambition as frivolous, saying it would never\r\ngive him bread. His family were Quakers, sturdy of stature as of\r\ncharacter. He is called "The Quaker Poet."\r\n\r\nWhittier led the life of a New England farm boy, used to hard work\r\nand few pleasures. His library consisted of practically one book, the\r\nfamily Bible. Later, a copy of Burns\'s poems was loaned to him by\r\nthe district schoolmaster. Like Burns he had great sympathy with the\r\nhumble and the poor. In his poems. Whittier described the scenes and\r\ntold the legends of his own locality. Home Ballads and Songs of Labor,\r\nin which "The Huskers" and "The Corn-Song" appear, are among his most\r\nwidely read books. They picture country life and the scenes of the\r\nsimple occupations common in his part of the country. Whittier was\r\nintensely patriotic and religious by nature. His happiness lay in his\r\nassociation with his friends, with children, animals, and the outdoor\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn these respects he was like Bryant, a man who found pleasure in\r\nsimple things. Like Bryant, also, he was interested in public affairs.\r\nAny injustice to the poor he opposed passionately. He wrote many poems\r\nin protest against slavery. He wrote, also, ballads of early New\r\nEngland history, and some of our most beautiful religious poetry comes\r\nfrom his pen. His life was less filled with business cares than that\r\nof Bryant, but it was equally full of interests that made him happy\r\nand source of help and joy to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUSKERS\r\n\r\nIt was late in mild October, and the long autumnal rain Had left the\r\nsummer harvest-fields all green with grass again; The first sharp\r\nfrosts had fallen, leaving all the woodlands gay With the hues of\r\nsummer\'s rainbow or the meadow flowers of May.\r\n\r\nThrough a thin, dry mist, that morning, the sun rose broad and red; At\r\nfirst a rayless disk of fire, he brightened as he sped; Yet even his\r\nnoontide glory fell chastened and subdued On the cornfields and the\r\norchards and softly pictured wood.\r\n\r\nAnd all that quiet afternoon, slow sloping to the night, He wove with\r\ngolden shuttle the haze with yellow light; Slanting through the tented\r\nbeeches, he glorified the hill; And, beneath it, pond and meadow lay\r\nbrighter, greener still.\r\n\r\nAnd shouting boys in woodland haunts caught glimpses of that sky,\r\nFlecked by the many-tinted leaves, and laughed, they knew not why; And\r\nschoolgirls, gay with aster-flowers, beside the meadow brooks, Mingled\r\nthe glow of autumn with the sunshine of sweet looks.\r\n\r\nFrom spire and barn looked westerly the patient weathercocks; But even\r\nthe birches on the hill stood motionless as rocks. No sound was in the\r\nwoodlands save the squirrel\'s dropping shell, And the yellow leaves\r\namong the boughs, low rustling as they fell.\r\n\r\nThe summer grains were harvested; the stubble-fields lay dry, Where\r\nJune winds rolled, in light and shade, the pale green waves of rye;\r\nBut still, on gentle hill-slopes, in valleys fringed with wood,\r\nungathered, bleaching in the sun, the heavy corn crop stood.\r\n\r\nBent low by autumn\'s wind and rain, through husks that, dry and sear,\r\nUnfolded from their ripened charge, shone out the yellow ear; Beneath,\r\nthe turnip lay concealed in many a verdant fold, And glistened in the\r\nslanting light the pumpkin\'s sphere of gold.\r\n\r\nThere wrought the busy harvester, and many a creaking wain Bore slowly\r\nto the long barn-floor its load of husk and grain; Till broad and red,\r\nas when he rose, the sun sank down at last, And like a merry guest\'s\r\nfarewell the day in brightness passed.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! as through the western pines, on meadow, stream, and pond,\r\nFlamed the red radiance of a sky set all afire beyond, Slowly o\'er\r\nthe eastern sea-bluffs a milder glory shone, And the sunset and the\r\nmoonrise were mingled into one!\r\n\r\nAs thus into the quiet night the twilight lapsed away, And deeper in\r\nthe brightening moon the tranquil shadows lay, From many a brown old\r\nfarmhouse and hamlet without name, Their milking and their home-tasks\r\ndone, the merry huskers came.\r\n\r\nSwung o\'er the heaped-up harvest, from pitchforks in the mow, Shone\r\ndimly down the lanterns on the pleasant scene below, The glowing pile\r\nof husks behind, the golden ears before, And laughing eyes and busy\r\nhands and brown cheeks glimmering o\'er.\r\n\r\nHalf hidden in a quiet nook, serene of look and heart, Talking their\r\nold times over, the old men sat apart; While up and down the unhusked\r\npile, or nestling in its shade, At hide-and-seek, with laugh and\r\nshout, the happy children played.\r\n\r\nUrged by the good host\'s daughter, a maiden young and fair, Lifting to\r\nlight her sweet blue eyes and pride of soft brown hair, The master of\r\nthe village school, sleek of hair and smooth of tongue, To the quaint\r\ntune of some old psalm, a husking-ballad sung.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

He led a happy\r\nlife, rambling in his boyhood about every nook and corner of the city\r\nand the adjacent woods, which at that time were not very far to seek.\r\nNew York, called New Amsterdam in early colonial times, was then the\r\ncapital of the country, and here the boy grew up happy, seeing many\r\nsides of American life, both in the city and country.\r\n\r\nManhattan Island and the region about it, with its commanding position\r\nat the entrance to a great inland waterway, was from the first a\r\nprize for which the nations from across the sea had contended. Such\r\na mingling of different people must give rise to interesting\r\nexperiences, and when someone appears who can put the story of those\r\nevents into a pleasing sketch, then we begin to have real literature:\r\nIrving had not only the experience and observation, but the ability\r\n\'to express what he had seen and felt. Therefore, when he grew to\r\nmanhood and gave his sketches of this region to the world, we had our\r\nfirst real American literature.\r\n\r\nIrving is best known as a humorist and a charming storyteller, but he\r\nhas also written serious and tender works. His life of Washington is a\r\ntribute of loving reverence to the great American for whom he was named.\r\nAs a boy, Irving was of a rather mischievous turn, a trait which perhaps\r\nhelped to make him the "first American humorist." Indeed, it has been\r\nsaid that "before Irving there was no laughter in the land." He is called\r\nthe "Father of American Literature," and also the "gentle humorist."\r\n"Capturing the Wild Horse" is taken from A Tour of the Prairies, and\r\n"The Adventure of the Mason" from The Alhambra.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURING THE WILD HORSE\r\n\r\nWe left the buffalo camp about eight o\'clock and had a toilsome march\r\nof two hours over ridges of hills covered with a ragged forest of\r\nscrub-oaks and broken by deep gullies. Among the oaks I observed many\r\nof the most diminutive size, some not above a foot high, yet bearing\r\nabundance of small acorns.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o\'clock in the morning we came to where this line of rugged\r\nhills swept down into a valley, through which flowed the north fork of\r\nthe Red River. A beautiful meadow about half a mile wide, colored with\r\nyellow autumnal flowers, stretched for two or three miles along the\r\nfoot of the hills, bordered on the opposite side by the river, whose\r\nbank was fringed with cottonwood trees.\r\n\r\nThe meadow was finely diversified by groves and clumps of trees, so\r\nhappily arranged that they seemed as if set out by the hand of art. As\r\nwe cast our eyes over this fresh and delightful valley, we saw a troop\r\nof wild horses quietly grazing on a green lawn about a mile distant\r\nto our right, while to our left, at nearly the same distance, were\r\nseveral buffaloes--some feeding, others reposing and ruminating among\r\nthe high, rich herbage under the shade of a clump of cottonwood trees.\r\nThe whole had the appearance of a broad, beautiful tract of pasture\r\nland on the estate of some gentleman farmer, with his cattle grazing\r\nabout the lawns and meadows. A council of war was now held, and it was\r\ndetermined to profit by the present favorable opportunity and try our\r\nhand at the grand hunting-maneuver which is called "ringing the wild\r\nhorse." This requires a large party of horsemen, well mounted.\r\n\r\nThey extend themselves in each direction, singly, at certain\r\ndistances apart, and gradually form a ring of two or three miles in\r\ncircumference, so as to surround the game. This has to be done\r\nwith extreme care, for the wild horse is the most readily alarmed\r\ninhabitant of the prairie, and can scent a hunter at a great distance,\r\nif to windward.\r\n\r\nThe ring being formed, two or three ride toward the horses, which\r\nstart off in an opposite direction. Whenever they approach the bounds\r\nof the ring, however, a huntsman presents himself and turns them from\r\ntheir course. In this way they are checked and driven back at every\r\npoint, and kept galloping round and round this magic circle, until,\r\nbeing completely tired down, it is easy for the hunters to ride up\r\nbeside them and throw the lariat over their heads. The prime horses of\r\nmost speed and courage, however, are apt to break through and escape,\r\nso that in general it is the second-rate horses that are taken.\r\n\r\nPreparations were now made for a hunt of this kind. The packhorses\r\nwere taken into the woods and firmly tied to trees, lest in a rush of\r\nthe wild horses they should break away with them. Twenty-five men were\r\nthen sent, under the command of a lieutenant, to steal along the edge\r\nof the valley within the strip of wood that skirted the hills. They\r\nwere to station themselves about fifty yards apart, within the edge of\r\nthe woods, and not advance or show themselves until the horses dashed\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five men were sent across the valley to steal in like manner\r\nalong the river bank that bordered the opposite side, and to station\r\nthemselves among the trees. A third party of about the same number was\r\nto form a line stretching across the lower part of the valley, so as\r\nto connect the two wings. Beatte and our other half-breed; Antoine,\r\ntogether with the ever-officious Tonish, were to make a circuit\r\nthrough the woods, so as to get to the upper part of the valley in the\r\nrear of the horses, and to drive them forward into the kind of sack\r\nthat we had formed, while the two wings should join behind them and\r\nmake a complete circle.\r\n\r\nThe flanking parties were quietly extending themselves, out of sight,\r\non each side of the valley, and the rest were stretching themselves\r\nlike the links of a chain across it, when the wild horses gave signs\r\nthat they scented an enemy--snuffing the air, snorting, and looking\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nAt length they pranced off slowly toward the river and disappeared\r\nbehind a green bank. Here, had the rules of the chase been observed,\r\nthey would have been quietly checked and turned back by the advance of\r\na hunter from among the trees; unluckily, however, we had our wildfire\r\nJack-o\'-lantern little Frenchman to deal with.\r\n\r\nInstead of keeping quietly up the right side of the valley to get\r\nabove the horses, the moment he saw them move toward the river he\r\nbroke out of the thicket of woods and dashed furiously across the\r\nplain in pursuit of them, being, mounted on one of the led horses\r\nbelonging to the Count. This put an end to all system. The half-breeds\r\nand half a score of rangers joined in the chase.\r\n\r\nAway they all went over the green bank; in a moment or two the wild\r\nhorses reappeared and came thundering down the valley, with Frenchman,\r\nhalf-breeds, and rangers galloping and yelling like mad behind them.\r\nIt was in vain that the line drawn across the valley attempted to\r\ncheck and turn back the fugitives. They were too hotly pressed by\r\ntheir pursuers; in their panic they dashed through the line and\r\nclattered down the plain.\r\n\r\nThe whole troop joined in the headlong chase-some of the rangers\r\nwithout hats or caps, their hair flying about their ears; others with\r\nhandkerchiefs tied round their heads. The buffaloes, which had been\r\ncalmly ruminating among the herbage, heaved up their huge forms, gazed\r\nfor a moment with astonishment at the tempest that came scouring down\r\nthe meadow, then turned and took to heavy-rolling flight. They were\r\nsoon overtaken; the mixed throng were pressed together by the sides of\r\nthe valley, and away they went, pell-mell, hurry-scurry, wild buffalo,\r\nwild horse, wild huntsman, with clang and clatter, and whoop and\r\nhalloo, that made the forests ring.\r\n\r\nAt length the buffaloes turned into a green brake on the river bank,\r\nwhile the horses dashed up a narrow defile of the hills, with their\r\npursuers close at their heels. Beatte passed several of them, having\r\nfixed his eye upon a fine Pawnee horse that had his ears slit, and\r\nsaddle marks upon his back. He pressed him gallantly, but lost him in\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\nAmong the wild horses was a fine black mare. In scrambling up the\r\ndefile she tripped and fell. A young ranger sprang from his horse and\r\nseized her by the mane and muzzle. Another ranger dismounted and came\r\nto his assistance. The mare struggled fiercely, kicking and biting,\r\nand striking with her forefeet; but a noose was slipped over her head,\r\nand her struggles were in vain. It was some time, however, before she\r\ngave over rearing and plunging, and lashing out with her feet on\r\nevery side. The two rangers then led her along the valley by two long\r\nlariats, which enabled them to keep at a sufficient distance on each\r\nside to be out of the reach of her hoofs; and whenever she struck out\r\nin one direction, she was jerked in the other. In this way her spirit\r\nwas gradually subdued.\r\n\r\nAs to little Tonish, who had marred the whole scene by his rashness,\r\nhe had been more successful than he deserved, having managed to catch\r\na beautiful cream-colored colt about seven months old, which had not\r\nstrength to keep up with its companions. The little Frenchman was\r\nbeside himself with joy. It was amusing to see him with his prize. The\r\ncolt would rear and kick and struggle to get free, when Tonish would\r\ntake him about the neck, wrestle with him, jump on his back, and cut\r\nas many antics as a monkey with a kitten.\r\n\r\nNothing surprised me more, however, than to see how soon these poor\r\nanimals, thus taken from the unbounded freedom of the prairie, yielded\r\nto the control of man.

One night he was\r\nroused from his first sleep by a knocking at his door. He opened it\r\nand beheld before him a tall stranger.\r\n\r\n"Hark ye, honest friend!" said the stranger; "I have observed that you\r\nare a good Christian and one to be trusted. Will you undertake a job\r\nthis very night?"\r\n\r\n"With all my heart, Senor, on condition that I am paid accordingly."\r\n\r\n"That you shall be; but you must suffer yourself to be blindfolded."\r\n\r\nTo this the mason made no objection. So, being hoodwinked, he was led\r\nby the stranger through various rough lanes and winding passages until\r\nthey stopped before the portal of a house. The stranger then applied a\r\nkey, turned a creaking lock, and opened what sounded like a ponderous\r\ndoor. They entered; the door was closed and bolted, and the mason\r\nwas conducted through an echoing corridor and a spacious hall to an\r\ninterior part of the building. Here the bandage was removed from his\r\neyes, and he found himself in a court dimly lighted by a single lamp.\r\nIn the center was the dry basin of an old fountain, under which the\r\nstranger requested him to form a small vault, bricks and mortar being\r\nat hand for the purpose. He worked all night, but without finishing\r\nthe job. Just before daybreak the stranger put a piece of gold into\r\nhis hand, and having again blindfolded him, conducted him back to his\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\n"Are you willing," said he, "to return and complete your work?"\r\n\r\n"Gladly, Senor, provided I am so well paid."\r\n\r\n"Well then, tomorrow at midnight I will call again."\r\n\r\nHe did so, and the vault was completed.\r\n\r\n"Now," said the stranger, "you must help me to bring forth the bodies\r\nthat are to be buried in this vault."\r\n\r\nThe poor mason\'s hair rose on his head at these words; he followed the\r\nstranger with trembling steps into a retired chamber of the mansion,\r\nexpecting to behold some ghastly spectacle of death, but was relieved\r\non seeing three or four jars standing in one corner. They were full of\r\nmoney, and it was with great labor that he and the stranger carried\r\nthem forth and consigned them to their tomb.\r\n\r\nThe vault was then closed, the pavement replaced, and all traces of\r\nthe work were obliterated. The mason was again hoodwinked and led\r\nforth by a route different from that by which he had come. After they\r\nhad wandered for a long time through a maze of lanes and alleys, they\r\nhalted.\r\n\r\nThe stranger then put two pieces of gold into his hand. "Wait here,"\r\nsaid he, "until you hear the cathedral bell toll. If you uncover your\r\neyes before that time, evil will befall you." So saying, he departed.\r\nThe mason waited faithfully, amusing himself by weighing the gold\r\npieces in his hand and clinking them against each other. The moment\r\nthe cathedral bell rang its peals he uncovered his eyes and found\r\nhimself on the banks of the Xenil; whence he made the best of his way\r\nhome and reveled with his family for a whole fortnight on the profits\r\nof his two nights\' work; after which he was as poor as ever.\r\n\r\nHe continued to work a little and pray a good deal and keep saints\'\r\ndays and holidays from year to year, while his family grew up gaunt\r\nand ragged as a crew of gypsies. As he was seated one evening at the\r\ndoor of his hovel, he was accosted by a rich old curmudgeon who was\r\nnoted for owning many houses and being a griping landlord. The man of\r\nmoney eyed him for a moment from beneath a pair of anxious, shaggy\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"I am told, friend, that you are very poor."\r\n\r\n"There is no denying the fact, Senor--it speaks for itself."\r\n\r\n"I presume then that you will be glad of a job and will work cheap?"\r\n\r\n"As cheap, my master, as any mason in Granada."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I want. I have an old house fallen into decay, which\r\ncosts me more money than it is worth to keep in repair, for nobody\r\nwill live in it. So I must patch it up and keep it together at as\r\nsmall expense as possible."\r\n\r\nThe mason was accordingly conducted to a large deserted house that\r\nseemed going to ruin. Passing through several empty halls and\r\nchambers, he entered an inner court, where his eye was caught by an\r\nold fountain. He paused for a moment, for a dreamy recollection of\r\nthe place came over him. "Pray," said he, "who occupied this house\r\nformerly?"\r\n\r\n"A pest upon him!" cried the landlord; "it was an old miserly fellow\r\nwho cared for nobody but himself. He was said to be immensely rich.\r\nHe died suddenly, and nothing could they find but a few ducats in a\r\nleathern purse. The worst luck has fallen on me, for since his death\r\nthe old fellow continues to occupy my house without paying rent. The\r\npeople pretend to hear the clinking of gold all night in the chamber\r\nwhere the old fellow slept, as if he were counting over his money,\r\nand sometimes a groaning and moaning about the court. Whether true or\r\nfalse, these stories have brought a bad name on my house, and not a\r\ntenant will remain in it."\r\n\r\n"Enough," said the mason sturdily; "let me live in your house\r\nrent-free until some better tenant appears, and I will put it in\r\nrepair and quiet the troubled spirit that disturbs it. I am a good\r\nChristian and a poor man and am not to be daunted by the Devil\r\nhimself, even though he should come in the shape of a big bag of\r\nmoney!"\r\n\r\nThe offer of the mason was gladly accepted. He moved with his family\r\ninto the house, and fulfilled all of his engagements. By little and\r\nlittle he restored it to its former state; the clinking of gold was no\r\nmore heard at night in the chamber of the defunct tenant, but began\r\nto be heard by day in the pocket of the living mason. In a word, he\r\nincreased rapidly in wealth, to the admiration of all his neighbors,\r\nand became one of the richest men in Granada. He gave large sums to\r\nthe Church--by way, no doubt, of satisfying his conscience--and never\r\nrevealed the secret of the vault until on his deathbed to his son and\r\nheir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

His Hiawatha is a\r\nnational poem that records the picturesque traditions of the American\r\nIndian. Its charm and melody are the delight of all children, and\r\nin years to come, when the race which it describes has utterly\r\ndisappeared, we shall value at even higher worth these stories of the\r\nromantic past of America and of the brave people who inhabited these\r\nmountains and plains before the white man came.\r\n\r\nBesides Indian stories, Longfellow wrote many narratives in verse\r\ndealing with old legends of America. "The Skeleton in Armor" is an\r\nexample of the legends about European explorers who came here before\r\nthe days of Columbus. Evangehne and The Courtship of Miles Standish\r\nare longer poems which find their subjects in early colonial history.\r\nHe wrote also of legends of Europe, and was well acquainted with\r\nstories and romances of older civilizations than ours. Equally\r\nwell-known poems, of a different type, are those in which household\r\njoys and sorrows give the theme. Longfellow is the poet of the\r\nhome-life, of simple hopes, of true religious faith. His spirit was\r\nthe Spirit of a child, affectionate, loyal, eager for romance and\r\nknightly adventure. He is the "Children\'s Poet," as the poem "The\r\nChildren\'s Hour" helps to show. There were sorrows as well as joys\r\nin his life, and this is why we go to him in trouble and why so many\r\npeople know his poems by heart. Sorrow never took away his faith or\r\nmade him bitter. He is genial and kindly, the friend--of all Americans\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nTHE ARROW AND THE SONG\r\n\r\n    I shot an arrow into the air;\r\n    It Fell to earth, I knew not where;\r\n    For, so swiftly it flew, the sight\r\n    Could not follow it in its flight.\r\n\r\n    I breathed a Song into the air;\r\n    It fell to earth, I knew not where;\r\n    For who has sight so keen and strong\r\n    That it can follow the flight of Song?\r\n\r\n    Long, long afterwards, in an oak\r\n    I found the arrow, still unbroke;\r\n    And the song, from beginning to end,\r\n    I found again in the heart of a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion: 1.

The Indians, like all other races of men, have such songs.\r\nLongfellow studied the Indian legends and put them into English verse\r\nso that all of us may enjoy them. Such a poem, which is really a\r\ncollection of ballads or songs about heroes and about the beliefs and\r\nsuperstitions of a race, is often called an epic. Notice that the poet\r\ntells you that these stories in verse have the odors of the forest,\r\nthe curling smoke of wigwams; the rushing of great rivers, and the\r\nroar of mountain thunder. This means that such stories are very\r\nclosely connected with the simple life of a simple people--there is\r\nmuch of their thought about Nature, much of their love of the land\r\nwhere they live. Next, notice that he got his knowledge of these songs\r\nfrom a "sweet singer," a minstrel. All simple tribes have had such\r\nsingers, who went about from place to place telling in verse what\r\nthe people wanted to hear. There were no books, both boys and girls\r\nlearned their stories from older people, or from wandering singers.\r\nNext, you observe that the theme of the stories is the life of\r\nHiawatha, their great hero. So the Greeks had stories about their hero\r\nUlysses, the early English about Beowulf and King Arthur, the French\r\nabout Roland. Every great race honors the memory of a hero who lived\r\nwhen the race was young. Many stories cluster about the name of this\r\nhero, and poets and minstrels love to sing, and the people to hear,\r\nabout these great characters. Finally, notice at the end of the\r\npoet\'s Introduction, two things: First, Hiawatha lived and toiled and\r\nsuffered that the tribes might prosper, that he might advance his\r\npeople-thus an epic poem deals with the founding of a people or race.\r\nSecond, you notice that there is much about God and Nature in the\r\npoem-the simple religious faith of the people. The hero, his deeds\r\nthat helped his people, the religion of the tribes-these are the\r\nsubjects. Find illustrations of these things as you read.\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

The Naked Bear will get thee!"\r\n    Lulled him into slumber, singing,\r\n    "Ewa-yea! my little owlet!\r\n    Who is this that lights the wigwam,\r\n    With his great eyes lights the wigwam?\r\n    Ewa-yea! my little owlet!"\r\n\r\n    Many things Nokomis taught him\r\n    Of the stars that shine in heaven;\r\n    Showed the broad, white road in heaven,\r\n    Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows,\r\n    Running straight across the heavens,\r\n    Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows.\r\n\r\n    At the door on summer evenings\r\n    Sat the little Hiawatha;\r\n    Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,\r\n    Heard the lapping of the water,\r\n    Sounds of music, words of wonder;\r\n    "Minne-wawa!" said the pine-trees,\r\n    "Mudway-aushka! said the water.\r\n\r\n    Saw the firefly, Wah-wah-taysee,\r\n    Flitting through the dusk of evening,\r\n    With the twinkle of its candle\r\n    Lighting up the brakes and bushes;\r\n    And he sang the song of children,\r\n    Sang the song Nokomis taught him:\r\n\r\n    "Wah-wah-taysee, little firefly,\r\n    Little, flitting, white-fire insect,\r\n    Little, dancing, white-fire creature,\r\n    Light me with your little candle,\r\n    Ere upon my bed I lay me,\r\n    Ere in sleep I close my eyelids!"\r\n\r\n    Saw the moon rise from the water\r\n    Rippling, rounding from the water;\r\n    Saw the flecks and shadows on it;\r\n    Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis?"\r\n    And the good Nokomis answered\r\n    "Once a warrior, very angry,\r\n    Seized his grandmother, and threw her\r\n    Up into the sky at midnight;\r\n    Right against the moon he threw her;\r\n    Tis her body that you see there."\r\n\r\n    Saw the rainbow in the heaven,\r\n    In the eastern sky, the rainbow;\r\n    Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis?"\r\n    And the good Nokomis answered:\r\n    "\'Tis the heaven of flowers you see there.\r\n    All the wild-flowers of the forest,\r\n    All the lilies of the prairie,\r\n    When on earth they fade and perish,\r\n    Blossom in that heaven above us."\r\n\r\n    When he heard the owls at midnight,\r\n    Hooting, laughing in the forest,\r\n    "What is that?" he cried in terror;\r\n    "What is that," he said, "Nokomis?"\r\n    And the good Nokomis answered:\r\n    "That is but the owl and owlet,\r\n    Talking in their native language,\r\n    Talking, scolding at each other."\r\n\r\n    Then the little Hiawatha\r\n    Learned of every bird its language,\r\n    Learned their names and all their secrets--\r\n    How they built their nests in summer,\r\n    Where they hid themselves in winter--\r\n    Talked with them whene\'er he met them,\r\n    Called them "Hiawatha\'s Chickens."\r\n\r\n    Of all beasts he learned the language,\r\n    Learned their names and all their secrets--\r\n    How the beavers built their lodges,\r\n    Where the squirrels hid their acorns,\r\n    How the reindeer ran so swiftly,\r\n    Why the rabbit was so timid;\r\n    Talked with them whene\'er he met then,\r\n    Called them "Hiawatha\'s Brothers."\r\n\r\n    Then Iagoo, the great boaster,\r\n    He the marvelous story-teller,\r\n    He the traveler and the talker,\r\n    He the friend of old Nokomis,\r\n    Made a bow for Hiawatha;\r\n    From a branch of ash he made it,\r\n    From an oak-bough made the arrows.\r\n    Tipped with flint, and winged with feathers,\r\n    And the cord he made of deerskin.\r\n\r\n    Then he said to Hiawatha:\r\n    "Go, my son, into the forest,\r\n    Where the red deer herd together;\r\n    Kill for us a famous roebuck,\r\n    Kill for us a deer with antlers!"\r\n\r\n    Forth into the forest straightway\r\n    All alone walked Hiawatha\r\n    Proudly, with his bow and arrows;\r\n    And the birds sang round him, o\'er him,\r\n    "Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!",\r\n    Sang the robin, the Opechee,\r\n    Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,\r\n    "Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"\r\n\r\n    Up the oak-tree, close beside him,\r\n    Sprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo,\r\n    In and out among the branches,\r\n    Coughed and chattered from the oak-tree,\r\n    Laughed, and said between his laughing;\r\n    "Do not shoot-me, Hiawatha!"\r\n\r\n    And the rabbit from his pathway\r\n    Leaped aside, and at a distance\r\n    Sat erect upon his haunches,\r\n    Half in fear and half in frolic,\r\n    Saying to the little hunter,\r\n    "Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"\r\n\r\n    But he heeded not, nor heard them,\r\n    For his thoughts were with the red deer;\r\n    On their tracks his eyes were fastened,\r\n    Leading downward to the river,\r\n    To the ford across the river;\r\n    And as one in slumber walked he.\r\n\r\n    Hidden in the alder-bushes,\r\n    There he waited till the deer came,\r\n    Till he saw two antlers lifted,\r\n    Saw two eyes look from the thicket,\r\n    Saw two nostrils point to windward,\r\n    And a deer came down the pathway,\r\n    Flecked with leafy light and shadow.\r\n    His heart within him fluttered,\r\n    Trembled like the leaves above him,\r\n    Like the birch-leaf palpitated,\r\n    As the deer came down the pathway.\r\n\r\n    Then, upon one knee uprising,\r\n    Hiawatha aimed an arrow;\r\n    Scarce a twig moved with his motion,\r\n    Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled,\r\n    But the wary roebuck started,\r\n    Stamped with all his hoofs together,\r\n    Listened with one foot uplifted,\r\n    Leaped as if to meet the arrow,\r\n    Ah! the singing, fatal arrow;\r\n    Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him!\r\n\r\n    Dead he lay there in the forest,\r\n    By the ford across the river;\r\n    Beat his timid heart no longer.\r\n    But the heart of Hiawatha\r\n    Throbbed and shouted and exulted,\r\n    As he bore the red deer homeward;\r\n    And WOO and Nokomis coming with applauses.\r\n\r\n    From the red deer\'s hide Nokomis\r\n    Made a cloak for Hiawatha;\r\n    From the red deer\'s flesh Nokomis\r\n    Made a banquet in his honor.\r\n    All the village came and feasted;\r\n    All the guests praised Hiawatha,\r\n    Called him Strong-Heart, Soan-ge-taha!\r\n    Called him Loon-Heart, Mahn-go-taysee!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

Bound to him in closest union,\r\n    And to whom he gave the right hand\r\n    Of his heart, in joy and sorrow:\r\n    Chibiabos, the musician,\r\n    And the very strong man, Kwasind.\r\n\r\n    Most beloved by Hiawatha\r\n    Was the gentle Chibiabos,\r\n    We the best of all musicians,\r\n    He the sweetest of all singers.\r\n    Beautiful and childlike was he,\r\n    Brave as man is, soft as woman,\r\n    Pliant as a wand of willow,\r\n    Stately as a deer with antlers.\r\n\r\n    When he sang, the village listened;\r\n    All the warriors gathered round him,\r\n    All the women came to hear him;\r\n    Now he stirred their souls to passion,\r\n    Now he melted them to pity.\r\n\r\n    From the hollow reeds he fashioned\r\n    Flutes so musical and mellow\r\n    That the brook, the Sebowisha,\r\n    Ceased to murmur in the woodland,\r\n    That the wood-birds ceased from singing,\r\n    And the squirrel, Adjidaumo,\r\n    Ceased his chatter in the oak-tree,\r\n    Ceased his chatter in the oak-tree,\r\n    And the rabbit, the Wabasso,\r\n    Sat upright to look and listen.\r\n\r\n    Yes, the brook, the Sebowisha,\r\n    Pausing, said, "O Chibiabos,\r\n    Teach my waves to flow in music,\r\n    Softly as your words in singing!"\r\n\r\n    Yes, the bluebird, the Owaissa,\r\n    Envious, said, "O Chibiabos,\r\n    Teach me tones as wild and wayward,\r\n    Teach me songs as full of frenzy!"\r\n\r\n    Yes, the robin, the Opechee,\r\n    Joyous, said, "O Chibiabos,\r\n    Teach me tunes as sweet and tender,\r\n    Teach me songs as full of gladness!"\r\n\r\n    And the whippoorwill, Wawonaissa,\r\n    Sobbing, said, "O Chibiabos,\r\n    Teach me tones as melancholy,\r\n    Teach me songs as full of sadness!"\r\n\r\n    All the many sounds of nature\r\n    Borrowed sweetness from his singing;\r\n    All the hearts of men were softened\r\n    By the pathos of his music;\r\n    For he sang of peace and freedom,\r\n    Sang of beauty, love, and longing;\r\n    Sang of death, and life undying\r\n    In the Islands of the Blessed,\r\n    In the kingdom of Pond,\r\n    In the land of the Hereafter.\r\n\r\n    Very dear to Hiawatha\r\n    Was the gentle Chibiabos.\r\n    He the best of all musicians,\r\n    He the sweetest of all singers;\r\n    For his gentleness he loved him,\r\n    And the magic of his singing.\r\n\r\n    Dear, too, unto Hiawatha\r\n    Was the very strong man, Kwasind,\r\n    He the strongest of all mortals,\r\n    He the mightiest among many;\r\n    For his very strength he loved him,\r\n    For his strength allied to goodness.\r\n\r\n    Idle in his youth was Kwasind,\r\n    Very listless, dull, and dreamy,\r\n    Never played with other children,\r\n    Never fished and never hunted;\r\n    Not like other children was he.\r\n\r\n    "Lazy Kwasind!" said his mother,\r\n    "In my work you never help me!\r\n    In the summer you are roaming\r\n    Idly in the fields and forests;\r\n    In the winter you are cowering\r\n    O\'er the firebrands in the wigwam!\r\n    In the coldest days of winter\r\n    I must break the ice for fishing;\r\n    With my nets you never help me!\r\n    At the door--my nets are hanging,\r\n    Dripping, freezing with the water;\r\n    Go and wring them, Yenadizze!\r\n    Go and dry them in the sunshine!"\r\n\r\n    Slowly, from the ashes, Kwasind\r\n    Rose, but made no angry answer;\r\n    From the lodge went forth in silence,\r\n    Took the nets, that hung together,\r\n    Dripping, freezing at the doorway;\r\n    Like a wisp of straw he wrung them,\r\n    Like a wisp of straw he broke them,\r\n    Could not wring them without breaking,\r\n    Such the strength was in his fingers.\r\n\r\n    "Lazy Kwasind!" said his father,\r\n    "In the hunt you never help me;\r\n    Every bow you touch is broken,\r\n    Snapped asunder every arrow;\r\n    Yet come with me to the forest,\r\n    You shall bring the hunting homeward."\r\n\r\n    Down a narrow pass they wandered,\r\n    Where a brooklet led them onward,\r\n    Where the trail of deer and bison\r\n    Marked the soft mud on the margin,\r\n    Till they found all further passage\r\n    Shut against them, barred securely\r\n    By the trunks of trees uprooted,\r\n    Lying lengthwise, lying crosswise,\r\n    And forbidding further passage.\r\n\r\n    "We must go back," said the old man;\r\n    "O\'er these logs we cannot clamber;\r\n    Not a woodchuck could get through them,\r\n    Not a squirrel clamber o\'er them!"\r\n    And straightway his pipe he lighted,\r\n    And sat down to smoke and ponder.\r\n    But before his pipe was finished,\r\n    Lo! the path was cleared before him;\r\n    All the trunks had Kwasind lifted;\r\n    To the right hand, to the left hand,\r\n    Shot the pine-trees swift as arrows;\r\n    Hurled the cedars light as lances.\r\n\r\n    "Lazy Kwasind!" said the young men,\r\n    As they sported in the meadow;\r\n    "Why stand idly looking at us,\r\n    Leaning on the rock behind you?\r\n    Come and wrestle with the others;\r\n    Let us pitch the quoit together!"\r\n\r\n    Lazy Kwasind made no answer,\r\n    To their challenge made no answer,\r\n    Only rose, and, slowly turning,\r\n    Seized the huge rock in his fingers,\r\n    Tore it from its deep foundation,\r\n    Poised it in the air a moment,\r\n    Pitched it sheer into the river,\r\n    Sheer into the swift Pauwating,\r\n    Where it still is seen in summer.\r\n\r\n    Once as down that foaming river,\r\n    Down the rapids of Pauwating,\r\n    Kwasind sailed with his companions,\r\n    In the stream he saw a beaver,\r\n    Saw Ahmeek, the King of Beavers,\r\n    Struggling with the rushing currents,\r\n    Rising, sinking in the water.\r\n\r\n    Without speaking, without pausing,\r\n    Kwasind leaped into the river,\r\n    Plunged beneath the bubbling surface,\r\n    Through the whirlpools chased the beaver,\r\n    Followed him among the islands,\r\n    Stayed so long beneath the water\r\n    That his terrified companions\r\n    Cried, "Alas! good-by to Kwasind!\r\n    We shall never more see Kwasind!"\r\n    But he reappeared triumphant,\r\n    And upon his shining shoulders\r\n    Brought the beaver, dead and dripping,\r\n    Brought the King of all the Beavers.\r\n\r\n    And these two, as I have told you,\r\n    Were the friends of Hiawatha,\r\n    Chibiabos, the musician,\r\n    And the very strong man, Kwasind;\r\n    Long they lived in peace together,\r\n    Spake with naked hearts together,\r\n    Pondering much and much contriving\r\n    How the tribes of men might prosper.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

yellow bark, O Birch Tree!\r\n    Growing by the rushing river,\r\n    Tall and stately in the valley!\r\n    I a light canoe will build me,\r\n    Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing,\r\n    That shall float upon the river,\r\n    Like a yellow leaf in autumn,\r\n    Like a yellow water-lily!\r\n\r\n    "Lay aside your cloak, O Birch-Tree!\r\n    Lay aside your white-skin wrapper,\r\n    For the summer-time is coming,\r\n    And the sun is warm in heaven,\r\n    And you need no white-skin wrapper!"\r\n    Thus aloud cried Hiawatha.\r\n\r\n    And the tree with all its branches\r\n    Rustled in the breeze of morning,\r\n    Saying, with a sigh of patience,\r\n    "Take my cloak, O Hiawatha!"\r\n\r\n    With his knife the tree he girdled,\r\n    Just beneath its lowest branches;\r\n    Just above the roots he cut it,\r\n    Till the sap came oozing outward;\r\n    Down the trunk, from top to bottom,\r\n    Sheer he cleft the bark asunder;\r\n    With a wooden wedge he raised it,\r\n    Stripped it from the trunk unbroken.\r\n\r\n    "Give me of your boughs, O Cedar!\r\n    Of your strong and pliant branches,\r\n    My canoe to make more steady,\r\n    Make more strong and firm beneath me!"\r\n    Through the summit of the Cedar\r\n    Went a sound, a cry of horror,\r\n    Went a murmur of resistance;\r\n    But it whispered, bending downward,\r\n    "Take my boughs, O Hiawatha!"\r\n\r\n    Down he hewed the boughs of cedar,\r\n    Shaped them straightway to a framework;\r\n    Like two bows he formed and shaped them,\r\n    Like two bended bows together.\r\n\r\n    "Give me of your roots, O Tamarack!\r\n    Of your fibrous roots, O Larch-Tree!\r\n    My canoe to bind together,\r\n    So to bind the ends together\r\n    That the water may not enter,\r\n    That the river may not wet me!"\r\n\r\n    And the Larch, with all its fibers,\r\n    Shivered in the air of morning,\r\n    Touched his forehead with its tassels,\r\n    Said, with one long sigh of sorrow,\r\n    "Take them all, O Hiawatha!"\r\n\r\n    From the earth he tore the fibers,\r\n    Tore the tough roots of the Larch-Tree,\r\n    Closely sewed the bark together,\r\n    Bound it closely to the framework.\r\n\r\n    "Give me of your balm, O Fir-Tree!\r\n    Of your balsam and your resin,\r\n    So to close the seams together\r\n    That the water may not enter,\r\n    That the river may not wet me!"\r\n\r\n    And the Fir-Tree, tall and somber,\r\n    Sobbed through all its robes of darkness,\r\n    Rattled like a shore with pebbles,\r\n    Answered wailing, answered weeping,\r\n    "Take my balm, 0 Hiawatha!"\r\n\r\n    And he took the tears of balsam,\r\n    Took the resin of the Fir-Tree,\r\n    Smeared therewith each seam and fissure,\r\n    Made each crevice safe from water.\r\n\r\n    "Give me of your quills, O Hedgehog!\r\n    All your quills, O Kagh, the Hedgehog!\r\n    I will make a necklace of them,\r\n    Make a girdle for my beauty,\r\n    And two stars to deck her bosom!"\r\n\r\n    From a hollow tree the hedgehog,\r\n    With his sleepy eyes looked at him,\r\n    Shot his shining quills, like arrows\r\n    Saying, with a drowsy murmur,\r\n    Through the tangle of his whiskers,\r\n    "Take my quills, O Hiawatha!"\r\n\r\n    From the ground the quills he gathered,\r\n    All the little shining arrows;\r\n    Stained them red and blue and yellow,\r\n    With the juice of roots and berries;\r\n    Into his canoe he wrought them,\r\n    Round its waist a shining girdle,\r\n    Round its bows a gleaming necklace,\r\n    On its breast two stars resplendent.\r\n\r\n    Thus the Birch-Canoe was builded\r\n    In the valley, by the river,\r\n    In the bosom of the forest;\r\n    And the forest\'s life was in it--\r\n    All its mystery and its magic,\r\n    All the lightness of the birch-tree,\r\n    All the toughness of the cedar,\r\n    All the larch\'s supple sinews;\r\n    And it floated on the river\r\n    Like a yellow leaf in autumn,\r\n    Like a yellow water-lily.\r\n\r\n    Paddles none had Hiawatha;\r\n    Paddles none he had or needed,\r\n    For his thoughts as paddles served him,\r\n    And his wishes served to guide him;\r\n    Swift or slow at will he glided,\r\n    Veered to right or left at pleasure.\r\n\r\n    Then he called aloud to Kwasind,\r\n    To his friend, the strong man, Kwasind,\r\n    Saying, "Help me clear this river\r\n    Of its sunken logs and sandbars."\r\n\r\n    Straight into the river Kwasind\r\n    Plunged as if he were an otter,\r\n    Dived as if he were a beaver,\r\n    Stood up to his waist in water,\r\n    To his armpits in the river,\r\n    Swam and shouted in the river,\r\n    Tugged at sunken logs and branches;\r\n    With his hands he scooped the sandbars,\r\n    With his feet the ooze and tangle.\r\n\r\n    And thus sailed my Hiawatha\r\n    Down the rushing Taquamenaw,\r\n    Sailed through all its bends and windings,\r\n    Sailed through all its deeps and shallows,\r\n    While his friend, the strong man, Kwasind,\r\n    Swam the deeps, the shallows waded.\r\n\r\n    Up and down the river went they,\r\n    In and out among its

is woman\r\n    Though she bends him, she obeys him,\r\n    Though she draws him, yet she follows--\r\n    Useless each without the other!"\r\n\r\n    Thus the youthful Hiawatha\r\n    Said within himself and pondered\r\n    Much perplexed by various feelings--\r\n    Listless, longing, hoping, fearing,\r\n    Dreaming still of Minnehaha,\r\n    Of the lovely Laughing Water,\r\n    In the Land of the Dacotahs.\r\n\r\n    "Wed a maiden of your people,"\r\n    Warning said the old Nokomis;\r\n    "Go not eastward, go not westward,\r\n    For a stranger, whom we know not!\r\n    Like a fire upon the hearthstone\r\n    Is a neighbor\'s homely daughter;\r\n    Like the starlight or the moonlight\r\n    Is the handsomest of strangers!"\r\n\r\n    Thus dissuading spake Nokomis,\r\n    And my Hiawatha answered\r\n    Only this: "Dear old Nokomis,\r\n    Very pleasant is the firelight,\r\n    But I like the starlight better,\r\n    Better do I like the moonlight!"\r\n\r\n    Gravely then said old Nokomis:\r\n    "Bring not here an idle maiden,\r\n    Bring not here a useless woman,\r\n    Hands unskillful, feet unwilling;\r\n    Bring a wife with nimble fingers,\r\n\r\n    Heart and hand that move together,\r\n    Feet that run on willing errands!"\r\n\r\n    Smiling answered Hiawatha:\r\n    "In the Land of the Dacotahs\r\n    Lives the Arrow-maker\'s daughter,\r\n    Minnehaha, Laughing Water,\r\n    Handsomest of all the women.\r\n    I will bring her to your wigwam;\r\n    She shall run upon your errands,\r\n    Be your starlight, moonlight, firelight,\r\n    Be the sunlight of my people!"\r\n\r\n    Still dissuading, said Nokomis:\r\n    "Bring not to my lodge a stranger\r\n    From the Land of the Dacotahs!\r\n    Very fierce are the Dacotahs.\r\n    Often is there war between us;\r\n    There are feuds yet unforgotten,\r\n    Wounds that ache and still may open!"\r\n\r\n    Laughing answered Hiawatha:\r\n    "For that reason, if no other,\r\n    Would I wed the fair Dacotah,\r\n    That our tribes might be united,\r\n    That old feuds might be forgotten,\r\n    And old wounds be healed forever!"\r\n\r\n    Thus departed Hiawatha\r\n    To the land of the Dacotahs,\r\n    To the land of handsome women,\r\n    Striding over moor and meadow,\r\n    Through interminable forests,\r\n    Through uninterrupted silence.\r\n\r\n    With his moccasins of magic,\r\n    At each stride a mile he measured;\r\n    Yet the way seemed long before him,\r\n    And his heart outran his footsteps;\r\n    And he journeyed without resting,\r\n    Till he heard the cataract\'s laughter,\r\n    Heard the Falls of Minnehaha\r\n    Calling to him through the silence.\r\n\r\n    "Pleasant is the sound!" he murmured,\r\n    "Pleasant is the voice that calls me!"\r\n    On the outskirts of the forest,\r\n    \'Twixt the shadow and the sunshine,\r\n    Herds of fallow deer were feeding,\r\n    But they saw not Hiawatha;\r\n    To his bow he whispered, "Fail not!"\r\n    To his arrow whispered, "Swerve not!"\r\n    Sent it singing on its errand,\r\n    To the red heart of the roebuck;\r\n    Threw the deer across his shoulder\r\n    And sped forward without pausing.\r\n\r\n    At the doorway of his wigwam\r\n    Sat the ancient Arrow-maker,\r\n    In the land of the Dacotahs,\r\n    Making arrow-heads of jasper,\r\n    Arrow-heads of chalcedony.\r\n    At his side, in all her beauty,\r\n    Sat the lovely Minnehaha,\r\n    Sat his daughter, Laughing Water,\r\n    Plaiting mats of flags and rushes;\r\n    Of the past the old man\'s thoughts were,\r\n    And the maiden\'s of the future.\r\n\r\n    He was thinking, as he sat there,\r\n    Of the days when with such arrows\r\n    He had struck the deer and bison,\r\n    On the Muskoday, the meadow;\r\n    Shot the wild goose, flying southward,\r\n    On the wing, the clamorous Wawa;\r\n    Thinking of the great war-parties,\r\n    How they came to buy his arrows,\r\n    Could not fight without his arrows.\r\n\r\n    She was thinking of a hunter,\r\n    From another tribe and country,\r\n    Young and tall and very handsome,\r\n    Who one morning, in the springtime,\r\n    Came to buy her father\'s arrows,\r\n    Sat and rested in the wigwam,\r\n    Lingered long about the doorway,\r\n    Looking back as he departed.\r\n    She had heard her father praise him,\r\n    Praise his courage and his wisdom;\r\n    Would he come again for arrows\r\n    To the Falls of Minnehaha?\r\n    On the mat her hands lay idle,\r\n    And her eyes were very dreamy.\r\n\r\n    Through their thoughts they heard a footstep,\r\n    Heard a rustling in the branches,\r\n    And with glowing cheek and forehead,\r\n    With the deer upon his shoulders,\r\n    Suddenly from out the woodlands\r\n    Hiawatha stood before them.\r\n\r\n    Straight the ancient Arrow-maker\r\n    Looked up gravely from his labor,\r\n    Laid aside the unfinished arrow,\r\n    Bade him enter at the doorway,\r\n    Saying, as he rose to meet him,\r\n    "Hiawatha, you are welcome!"\r\n\r\n    At the feet of Laughing Water\r\n    Hiawatha laid his burden,\r\n    Threw the red deer from his shoulders;\r\n    And the maiden looked up at him,\r\n    Looked up from her mat of rushes,\r\n    Said with gentle look and accent,\r\n    "You are welcome, Hiawatha!"\r\n    Very spacious was the wigwam,\r\n    Made of deerskin dressed and whitened,\r\n    With the gods of the Dacotahs\r\n    Drawn and painted on its curtains;\r\n    And so tall the doorway, hardly\r\n    Hiawatha stooped to enter,\r\n    Hardly touched his eagle-feathers\r\n    As he entered at the doorway.\r\n\r\n    Then up rose the Laughing Water;\r\n    From the ground fair Minnehaha\r\n    Laid aside her mat unfinished,\r\n    Brought forth food and set before them,\r\n    Water brought them from the brooklet,\r\n    Gave them food in earthen vessels,\r\n    Gave them drink in bowls of basswood,\r\n    Listened while the guest was speaking,\r\n    Listened while her father answered.\r\n    But not once her lips she opened,\r\n    Not a single word she uttered.\r\n\r\n    Yes, as in a dream she listened\r\n    To the words of Hiawatha,\r\n    As he talked of old Nokomis,\r\n    Who had nursed him in his childhood,\r\n    As he told of his companions, Chibiabos,\r\n    the musician, And the very strong man,\r\n    Kwasind, And of happiness and plenty In\r\n    the land of the Ojibways,\r\n\r\n    In the pleasant land and peaceful.\r\n    "After many years of warfare,\r\n    Many years of strife and bloodshed,\r\n    There is peace between the Ojibways\r\n    And the tribe of the Dacotahs."\r\n    Thus continued Hiawatha,\r\n    And then added, speaking slowly,\r\n    "That this peace may last forever,\r\n    And our hands be clasped more closely,\r\n    And our hearts be more united,\r\n    Give me as my wife this maiden,\r\n    Minnehaha, Laughing Water,\r\n    Loveliest of Dacotah women!"\r\n\r\n    And the ancient Arrow-maker\r\n    Paused a moment ere he answered,\r\n    Smoked a little while in silence,\r\n    Looked at Hiawatha proudly,\r\n    Fondly looked at Laughing Water,\r\n    And made answer very gravely:\r\n    "Yes, if Minnehaha wishes;\r\n    Let your heart speak, Minnehaha!"\r\n\r\n    And the lovely Laughing Water\r\n    Seemed more lovely, as she stood there,\r\n    Neither willing nor reluctant,\r\n    As she went to Hiawatha,\r\n    Softly took the seat beside him,\r\n    While she said, and blushed to say it,\r\n    "I will follow you, my husband!"\r\n\r\n    This was Hiawatha\'s wooing!\r\n    Thus it was he won the daughter\r\n    Of the ancient Arrow-maker,\r\n    In the land of the Dacotahs!\r\n\r\n    From the wigwam he departed,\r\n    Leading with him Laughing Water;\r\n    Hand in hand they went together,\r\n    Through the woodland and the meadow,\r\n    Left the old man standing lonely\r\n    At the doorway of his wigwam,\r\n    Heard the Falls of Minnehaha\r\n    Calling to them from the distance,\r\n    Crying to them from afar off,\r\n    "Fare thee well, O Minnehaha!"\r\n    And the ancient Arrow-maker\r\n    Turned again unto his labor,\r\n    Sat down by his sunny doorway,\r\n    Murmuring to himself, and saying:\r\n    "Thus it is our daughters leave us,\r\n    Those we love, and those who love us!\r\n    Just when they have learned to help us,\r\n    When we are old and lean upon them,\r\n    Comes a youth with flaunting feathers,\r\n    With his flute of reeds, a stranger,\r\n    Wanders piping through the village,\r\n    Beckons to the fairest maiden,\r\n    And she follows where he leads her,\r\n    Leaving all things for the stranger!"\r\n\r\n    Pleasant was the journey homeward,\r\n    Through interminable forests,\r\n    Over meadow, over mountain,\r\n    Over river, hill, and hollow.\r\n    Short it seemed to Hiawatha,\r\n    Though they journeyed very slowly,\r\n    Though his pace he checked and slackened\r\n    To the steps of Laughing Water.\r\n    Over wide and rushing rivers\r\n    In his arms he bore the maiden;\r\n\r\n    Light he thought her as a feather,\r\n    As the plume upon his head-gear;\r\n    Cleared the tangled pathway for her,\r\n    Bent aside the swaying branches,\r\n    Made at night a lodge of branches,\r\n    And a bed with boughs of hemlock,\r\n    And a fire before the doorway\r\n    With the dry cones of the pine-tree.\r\n\r\n    All the traveling winds went with them,\r\n    O\'er the meadow, through the forest;\r\n    All the stars of night looked at them,\r\n    Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber;\r\n    From his ambush in the oak-tree\r\n    Peeped the squirrel, Adjidaumo,\r\n    Watched with eager eyes the lovers;\r\n    And the rabbit, the Wabasso,\r\n    Scampered from the path before them,\r\n    Peering, peeping from his burrow,\r\n    Sat erect upon his haunches,\r\n    Watched with curious eyes the lovers.\r\n\r\n    Pleasant was the journey homeward!\r\n    All the birds sang loud and sweetly\r\n    Songs of happiness and heart\'s-ease;\r\n    Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,\r\n    "Happy are you, Hiawatha,\r\n    Having such a wife to love you!"\r\n    Sang the robin, the Opechee,\r\n    "Happy are you; Laughing Water,\r\n    Having such a noble husband!"\r\n\r\n    From the sky the sun benignant\r\n    Looked upon them through the branches,\r\n    Saying to them, "O my children,\r\n    Love is sunshine, hate is shadow;\r\n    Life is checkered shade and sunshine;\r\n    Rule by love, O Hiawatha!"\r\n    From the sky the moon looked at them,\r\n    Filled the lodge with mystic splendors,\r\n    Whispered to them, "O my children,\r\n    Day is restless, night is quiet,\r\n    Man imperious, woman feeble;\r\n    Half is mine, although I follow;\r\n    Rule by patience, Laughing Water!"\r\n    Thus it was they journeyed homeward;\r\n    Thus it was that Hiawatha\r\n    To the lodge of old Nokomis\r\n    Brought the moonlight, starlight, firelight,\r\n    Brought the sunshine of his people,\r\n    Minnehaha, Laughing Water,\r\n    Handsomest of all the women\r\n    In the land of the Dacotahs,\r\n    In the land of handsome women.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

He was graduated\r\nfrom Bowdoin College in the class with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\r\n\r\nWhen a mere boy, Nathaniel was crippled by an accident in playing\r\nball. This led him to a life of quiet and to the companionship of\r\nbooks. His vivid imagination made him fond of inventing stories for\r\nthe entertainment of his friends. When he began to think of a career\r\nit was quite natural that he should turn to literature, and that in\r\nlooking about him for material he should-choose his subjects-as Irving\r\ndid-from those stirring scenes of which he had an intimate, almost\r\npersonal, knowledge many of them of his native town, Salem.\r\n\r\nHawthorne pictured New England as Irving did New Amsterdam. He\r\npopularized New England history in the form of stories for children,\r\none of which, Grandfather\'s Chair, contains "The Boston Tea Party." He\r\nwrote a book, The House of the Seven Gables, about the house in which\r\nhe lived for many years. Soon after he wrote this tale, he wrote The\r\nWonder-Book, a volume of stories about Greek gods and heroes, from\r\nwhich "The Paradise of Children" and "The Golden Touch" are taken.\r\nPerhaps the best known of all Hawthorne\'s works is the volume called\r\nTwice-Told Tales. In this book he collected a large number of legends\r\nabout colonial life in New England and retold them in such a way as to\r\ngive us one of the best pictures of early American life that we have.\r\nSome of them deal with actual events; others are based on legendary\r\nmatter. But all of them do for early New England life what\r\nLongfellow\'s Hiawatha does for the Indian legends: they preserve the\r\nstories and also the spirit of early times. Like Longfellow, Hawthorne\r\nwas a lover of romance and of the early history of our country. He w\r\nwrote in prose, not verse, but is prose is as careful and artistic as\r\nLongfellow\'s verse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARADISE OF CHILDREN\r\n\r\nPANDORA AND THE GREAT BOX\r\n\r\n\r\nLong, long ago, when this old world was in its tender infancy, there\r\nwas a child named Epimetheus who never had either father or mother;\r\nand that he might not be lonely, another child, fatherless and\r\nmotherless like himself, was sent from a far country to live with him\r\nand be his playfellow and helpmate. Her name was Pandora.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that Pandora saw when she entered the cottage where\r\nEpimetheus dwelt was a great box. And almost the first question which\r\nshe put to him, after crossing the threshold, was this:\r\n\r\n"Epimetheus, what have you in that box?"\r\n\r\n"My dear little Pandora," answered Epimetheus, "that is a secret, and\r\nyou must be kind enough not to ask any questions about it. The box\r\nwas left here to be kept safely, and I do not myself know what it\r\ncontains."\r\n\r\n"But who gave it to you?" asked Pandora. "And where did it come from?"\r\n"That is a secret, too," replied Epimetheus.\r\n\r\n"How provoking!" exclaimed Pandora, pouting her lip. "I wish the great\r\nugly box were out of the way!"\r\n\r\n"O come, don\'t think of it any more," cried Epimetheus. "Let us run\r\nout of doors, and have some nice play with the other children."\r\n\r\nIt is thousands of years since Epimetheus and Pandora were alive; and\r\nthe world nowadays is a very different sort of thing from what it was\r\nin their time. Then, everybody was a child. They needed no fathers and\r\nmothers to take care of the children; because there was no danger or\r\ntrouble of any kind, and there were no clothes to be mended, and there\r\nwas always plenty to eat and drink.\r\n\r\nWhenever a child wanted his dinner, he found it growing on a tree; and\r\nif he looked at the tree in the morning, he could see the blossom\r\nof that night\'s supper; or at eventide he saw the tender bud of\r\ntomorrow\'s breakfast. It was a very pleasant life indeed. No labor to\r\nbe done, no tasks to s be studied; nothing but sports and dances and\r\nsweet voices of children talking, or caroling like birds, or gushing\r\nout in merry laughter, throughout the livelong day.\r\n\r\nWhat was most wonderful of all, the children never quarreled among\r\nthemselves; neither had they any crying fits; nor since time first\r\nbegan had a single one of these little mortals ever gone apart into\r\na corner and sulked. O what a good time was that to be alive in! The\r\ntruth is, those ugly little winged monsters called Troubles, which are\r\nnow almost as numerous as mosquitoes, had never yet been seen on the\r\nearth. It is probable that the very greatest disquietude which a child\r\nhad ever felt was Pandora\'s vexation at not being able to discover the\r\nsecret of the mysterious box.\r\n\r\nThis was at first only the faint shadow of a Trouble; but every day\r\nit grew more and-more real, until before a great while the cottage\r\nof Epimetheus and Pandora was less sunshiny than those of the other\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n"Whence can the box have come?" Pandora continually kept saying to\r\nherself and to Epimetheus. "And can be inside of it?"\r\n\r\n"Always talking about this box!" said Epimetheus at last; for he had\r\ngrown extremely tired of the subject. "I wish, dear Pandora, you would\r\ntry to talk of something else. Come, let us go and gather some ripe\r\nfigs, and eat them under the trees for our supper. And I know a vine\r\nthat has the sweetest and juiciest grapes you ever tasted." "Always\r\ntalking about grapes and figs!" cried Pandora, pettishly.\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said Epimetheus, who was a very good-tempered child,\r\nlike many children in those days, "let us run out and have a merry\r\ntime with our playmates."\r\n\r\n"I am tired of merry times, and don\'t care if I never have any more!"\r\nanswered our pettish little Pandora. "And, besides, I never do have\r\nany. This ugly box! I am so taken up with thinking about it all the\r\ntime. I insist upon your telling me what is inside of it."\r\n\r\n"As I have already said fifty times over, I do not know!" replied\r\nEpimetheus, getting a little vexed. "How, then, can I tell you what is\r\ninside?"\r\n\r\n"You might open it," said Pandora, looking sideways at Epimetheus,\r\n"and then we could see for ourselves!"\r\n\r\n"Pandora, what are you thinking of?" exclaimed Epimetheus.\r\n\r\nAnd his face expressed so much horror at the idea of looking into a\r\nbox which had been given to him on the condition of his never opening\r\nit, that Pandora thought it best not to suggest it any more. Still,\r\nhowever, she could not help thinking and talking about the box.\r\n\r\n"At least," said she, "you can tell me how it came here."\r\n\r\n"It was left at the door," replied Epimetheus, "just before you came,\r\nby a person who looked very smiling and intelligent, and who could\r\nhardly forbear laughing as he put it down. He was dressed in an odd\r\nkind of cloak, and had on a cap that seemed to be made partly of\r\nfeathers, so that it looked almost as if it had wings."\r\n\r\n"What sort of staff had he?" asked Pandora.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the most curious staff you ever saw!" cried Epimetheus. "It was\r\nlike two serpents twisting around a stick, and was carved so naturally\r\nthat I at first thought the serpents were alive."\r\n\r\n"I know him," said Pandora thoughtfully. "Nobody else has such a\r\nstaff. It was Quicksilver; and he brought me hither, as well as the\r\nbox. No doubt he intended it for me; and most probably it contains\r\npretty dresses for me to wear, or toys for you and me to play with, or\r\nsomething very 5 nice for us both to eat!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so," answered Epimetheus, turning away. "But, until\r\nQuicksilver comes back and tells us so, we have neither of us any\r\nright to lift the lid of the box."\r\n\r\n"What a dull boy he is!" muttered Pandora, as Epimetheus left the\r\ncottage. "I do wish he had a little more enterprise!"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KNOT OF GOLDEN CORD\r\n\r\nFor the first time since her arrival Epimetheus had gone out without\r\nasking Pandora to accompany him. He went to gather figs and grapes for\r\nhimself, or to seek whatever amusement he could find in other society\r\nthan his little playfellow\'s. He was tired to death of hearing about\r\nthe box, and heartily wished that Quicksilver, or whatever was the\r\nmessenger\'s name, had left it at some other child\'s door where Pandora\r\nwould never have set eyes on it.\r\n\r\nSo perseveringly as she did babble about this one thing! The box, the\r\nbox, and nothing but the box! It seemed as if the box were bewitched,\r\nand as if the cottage were not big enough to hold it without Pandora\'s\r\ncontinually stumbling over it and making Epimetheus stumble over it\r\nlikewise, and bruising all four of their shins.\r\n\r\nWell, it was really hard that poor Epimetheus should have a box in his\r\nears from morning till night; especially as the little people of the\r\nearth were so unaccustomed to vexations in those happy days that they\r\nknew not how to deal with them. Thus a small vexation made as much\r\ndisturbance then as a far bigger one would in our own times.\r\n\r\nAfter Epimetheus was gone, Pandora stood gazing at the box. She had\r\ncalled it ugly above a hundred times; but in spite of all that she\r\nhad said against it, it was positively a very handsome article of\r\nfurniture, and would have been quite an ornament to any room in which\r\nit should be placed. It was made of a beautiful kind of wood with\r\ndark and rich veins spreading over its surface, which was so highly\r\npolished that little Pandora could see her face in it. As the child\r\nhad no other looking-glass, it is odd that she did not value the box\r\nmerely on this account.\r\n\r\nThe edges and corners of the box were carved with most wonderful\r\nskill. Around the margin there were figures of graceful men and women,\r\nand the prettiest children ever seen, reclining or sporting amid a\r\nprofusion of flowers and foliage; and these various objects were so\r\nfinely represented, and were wrought together in such harmony, that\r\nflowers, foliage, and human beings seemed to combine into a wreath\r\nof mingled beauty. But here and there, peeping forth from behind the\r\ncarved foliage, Pandora once or twice fancied she saw a face not so\r\nlovely, or something or other that was disagreeable, and which stole\r\nthe beauty out of all, the rest. Nevertheless, on looking more closely\r\nand touching the spot with her finger, she could discover nothing of\r\nthe kind. Some face that was really beautiful had been made to look\r\nugly by her catching a sideways glimpse at it.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful face of all was done in what is called high relief,\r\nin the center of the lid. There was nothing else save the dark, smooth\r\nrichness of the polished wood, and this one face in the center, with a\r\ngarland of flowers about its brow. Pandora had looked at this face a\r\ngreat many times, and imagined that the mouth could smile if it liked,\r\nor be grave when it chose, the same as any living mouth. The features,\r\nindeed, all wore a very lively and rather mischievous expression,\r\nwhich looked almost as if it needs must burst out of the carved lips\r\nand utter itself in words.\r\n\r\nHad the mouth spoken, it would probably have been something like this:\r\n\r\n"Do not be afraid, Pandora! What harm can there be in opening the box?\r\nNever mind that poor, simple Epimetheus! You are wiser than he, and\r\nhave ten times as much spirit. Open the box, and see if you do not\r\nfind something very pretty!" The box, I had almost forgotten to say,\r\nwas fastened, not by a lock or by any other such contrivance, but by a\r\nvery fine knot of gold cord. There appeared to be no end to this knot,\r\nand no beginning. Never was a knot so cunningly twisted, nor with so\r\nmany ins and outs, which roguishly defied the skillfulest fingers to\r\ndisentangle them. And yet, by the very difficulty that there was in\r\nit, Pandora was the more tempted to examine the knot, and just see how\r\nit was made. Two or three times already she had stooped over the box,\r\nand taken the knot between her thumb and forefinger, but without\r\npositively trying to undo it.\r\n\r\n"I really believe," said she to herself, that I begin to see how it\r\nwas done. Nay, perhaps I could tie it up again after undoing it. There\r\ncould be no harm in that, surely. Even Epimetheus would not blame me\r\nfor that. I need not open the box, and should not, of course, without\r\nthe foolish boy\'s consent, even if the knot were untied." It might\r\nhave been better for Pandora if she had had a little work to do,\r\nor anything to employ her mind upon, so as not to be so constantly\r\nthinking of this one subject. But children led so easy a life before\r\nany Troubles came into the world that they find really a great deal\r\ntoo much leisure. They could not be forever playing at hide-and-seek\r\namong the flower-shrubs, or at blind-man\'s buff with garlands over\r\ntheir eyes, or at whatever other games has been found out while Mother\r\nEarth was in her babyhood.\r\n\r\nWhen life is all sport, toil is the real play. There was absolutely\r\nnothing to do. A little sweeping and dusting about the cottage, I\r\nsuppose, and the gathering of fresh flowers (which were only too\r\nabundant everywhere), and arranging them in vases--and poor little\r\nPandora\'s day\'s work was over. And then, for the rest of the day,\r\nthere was the box!\r\n\r\nAfter all, I am not quite sure that the box was not a blessing to her\r\nin its way. It supplied her with so many ideas to think of, and to\r\ntalk about, whenever she had anybody to listen! When she was in good\r\nhumor, she could admire the bright polish of its sides and the rich\r\nborder of beautiful faces and foliage that ran all around it. Or, if\r\nshe chanced to be ill-tempered, she could give it a push, or kick it\r\nwith her naughty little foot. And many a kick did the box (but it was\r\na mischievous box, as we shall see, and deserved all it got) many a\r\nkick did it receive. But certain it is, if it had not been for the\r\nbox, our active-minded little Pandora would not have known half so\r\nwell how to spend her time as she now did.\r\n\r\nGUESSING WHAT WAS IN THE BOX\r\n\r\nFor it was really an endless employment to guess what was inside. What\r\ncould it be, indeed? Just imagine, my little hearers, how busy your\r\nwits would be if there were a great box in the house, which, as you\r\nmight have reason to suppose, contained something new and pretty for\r\nyour Christmas or New Year\'s gifts. Do you think that you should be\r\nless curious than Pandora? If you were left alone with the box, might\r\nyou not feel a little tempted to lift the lid? But you would not do\r\nit. Oh, fie! No, no! Only, if you thought there were toys in it, it\r\nwould be so very hard to let slip an opportunity of taking just one\r\npeep!\r\n\r\nI know not whether Pandora expected any toys; for none had yet begun\r\nto be made, probably, in those days, when the world itself was one\r\ngreat plaything for the children that dwelt upon it. But Pandora was\r\nconvinced that there was something very beautiful and valuable in the\r\nbox; and therefore she felt just as anxious to take a peep as any of\r\nthese little girls here around me would have felt. And, possibly,\r\na little more so; but of that I am not quite so certain. On this\r\nparticular day, however, which we have so long been talking about, her\r\ncuriosity grew so much greater than it usually was that at last she\r\napproached the box. She was more than half determined to open, it, if\r\nshe could. Ah, naughty Pandora! First, however, she tried to lift it.\r\nIt was heavy; much too heavy for the slender strength of a child like\r\nPandora. She raised one end of the box a few inches from the floor,\r\nand let it fall again with a pretty loud thump. A moment afterwards\r\nshe almost fancied that she heard something stir inside the box. She\r\napplied her ear as closely as possible and listened. Positively, there\r\ndid seem to be a kind of stifled murmur within. Or was it merely the\r\nsinging in Pandora\'s ear\'s. Or could it be the beating of her heart?\r\nThe child could not quite satisfy herself whether she had heard\r\nanything or no. But, at all events, her curiosity was stronger than\r\never, As she drew back her head, her eyes fell upon the knot of gold\r\ncord.\r\n\r\n"It must have been a very ingenious person who tied this knot," said\r\nPandora to herself. "But I think 1 could untie it, nevertheless. I am\r\nresolved, at least, to find the two ends of the cord."\r\n\r\nSo she took the golden knot in her fingers and pried into it as\r\nsharply as she could. Almost without intending it, or quite knowing\r\nwhat she was about, she was soon busily engaged in attempting to undo\r\nit. Meanwhile, the bright sunshine came through the open window; as\r\ndid likewise the merry voices of the children, playing at a distance,\r\nand perhaps the voice of Epimetheus among them.\r\n\r\nPandora stopped to listen. What a beautiful day it was! Would it not\r\nbe wise if she were to let the trouble some knot alone and think no\r\nmore about the box, but run and join her little playfellows and be\r\nhappy?\r\n\r\nAll this time, however, her fingers were busy with the knot; and\r\nhappening to glance at the face on the lid of the enchanted box, she\r\nseemed to see it slyly grinning at her.\r\n\r\n"That face looks very mischievous," thought Pandora. "I wonder whether\r\nit smiles because I am doing wrong! I have the greatest mind in the\r\nworld to run away!"\r\n\r\nBut just then, by the merest accident, she gave the knot a kind of\r\ntwist, which produced a wonderful result. The gold cord united itself,\r\nas if by magic, arid left the box without a fastening.\r\n\r\n"This is the strangest thing I ever knew!" said Pandora. "What will\r\nEpimetheus say? And how can I possibly tie it up again?" She made one\r\nor two attempts to restore the knot, but soon found it quite beyond\r\nher skill. It had untied itself so suddenly that she could not in the\r\nleast remember how the strings had been doubled onto one another; and\r\nwhen she tried to recollect the shape and appearance of the knot, it\r\nseemed to have gone entirely out of her mind. Nothing was to be done\r\ntherefore, but to let the box remain as it was until Epimetheus should\r\ncome in.\r\n\r\n"But," said Pandora, "when he finds the knot untied, he will know that\r\nI have done it. How shall I make him believe that I have not looked\r\ninto the box?"\r\n\r\nAnd then the thought came into her naughty little heart, that, since\r\nshe would be suspected of having looked into the box, she might just\r\nas well do so at once. O very naughty and very foolish Pandora! You\r\nshould have thought only of doing what was right and of leaving undone\r\nwhat was wrong, and not of what your playfellow Epimetheus would have\r\nsaid or believed. And so perhaps she might if the enchanted face on\r\nthe lid of the box had not looked so bewitchingly persuasive at her,\r\nand if she had not seemed to hear, more distinctly than before, the\r\nmurmur of small voices within. She could not tell whether it was fancy\r\nor no; but there was quite a little tumult of whispers in her\r\near--or else it was her curiosity that whispered: "Let us out, dear\r\nPandora--pray let us out! We will be such nice, pretty playfellows for\r\nyou! Only let us out!"\r\n\r\n"What can it be?" thought Pandora, "Is there something alive in the\r\nbox? Well!--yes!--I am resolved to take just one peep! Only one peep;\r\nand then lid shall be shut down as safely as ever. There cannot\r\npossibly be any harm in just one little peep!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TROUBLES CAME INTO THE WORLD\r\n\r\nBut it is now time for us to see what Epimetheus was doing.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time since his little Playmate had come to dwell\r\nwith him that he had attempted to enjoy any pleasure in which she did\r\nnot partake. But nothing went right; nor was he nearly so happy as\r\non other days. He could not find a sweat grape or a ripe fig (if\r\nEpimetheus had a fault, it was a little too much fondness for figs);\r\nor, if ripe at all, they were overripe, and so sweet as to be\r\ndistasteful. There was no mirth in his heart, such as usually made\r\nhis voice gush out, of Its own accord, and swell the merriment of his\r\ncompanions. In short, he grew so uneasy and discontented that other\r\nchildren could not imagine what was the matter with Epimetheus.\r\nNeither did he himself know what ailed him, any better then they did.\r\n\r\nFor you must recollect that, at the time we are speaking of, it was\r\neverybody\'s nature and common habit to be happy. The world had not\r\nyet learned to be otherwise. Not a single soul or body, since these\r\nchildren were first sent to enjoy it themselves on the beautiful\r\nearth, had ever been sick or out-of-sorts.\r\n\r\nAt length, discovering that, somehow or other, he put a stop to all\r\nthe play, Epimetheus judged it best to go back to Pandora, who was\r\nin a humor better suited to his own. But, with a hope of giving her\r\npleasure, he gathered flowers and made them into a wreath, which he\r\nmeant to put upon her head. The flowers were very lovely--roses and\r\nlilies and orange-blossoms, and a great many more, which left a trail\r\nof fragrance behind, as Epimetheus carried them along, and wreath was\r\nput together with as much skill as could be expected of a boy. The\r\nfingers of little girls, it has always appeared to me, are the fittest\r\nto twine flower-wreaths; but boys could de it in those days rather\r\nbetter than they can now.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must mention that a great black cloud had been gathering\r\nin the sky for some time past, although it had not yet overspread the\r\nsun. But, just as Epimetheus reached the cottage-door, this cloud\r\nbegan to cut off the sunshine, and thus to make a sudden and sad\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nHe entered softly; for he meant, if possible, to steal behind Pandora\r\nand fling a wreath of flowers over her head before she should be\r\naware of his approach. But, as it happened, there was no need of his\r\ntreading so very lightly. He might have trod as heavily as he pleased,\r\nas heavily as a grown man--as heavily, I was going to say, as an\r\nelephant--without much probability of Pandora\'s hearing his footsteps.\r\nShe was too intent upon her purpose. At the moment of this entering\r\nthe cottage the naughty box, I had almost forgotten to say, was\r\nfastened, not by a lock or by any other such contrivance, but by a\r\nvery fine knot of gold cord. There appeared to be no end to this knot,\r\nand no beginning. Never was a knot so cunningly twisted, nor with so\r\nmany ins and outs, which roguishly defied the skillfulest fingers to\r\ndisentangle them. And yet, by the very difficulty that there was in\r\nit, Pandora was the more tempted to examine the knot, and just see how\r\nit was made. Two or three times already she had stooped over the box,\r\nand taken the knot between her thumb and forefinger, but without\r\npositively trying to undo it.\r\n\r\n"I really believe," said she to herself, that I begin to see how it\r\nwas done. Nay, perhaps I could tie it up again after undoing it. There\r\ncould be no harm in that, surely. Even Epimetheus would not blame me\r\nfor that. I need not open the box, and should not, of course, without\r\nthe foolish boy\'s consent, even if the knot were untied."\r\n\r\nIt might have been better for Pandora if she had had a little work to\r\ndo, or anything to employ her mind upon, so as not to be so constantly\r\nthinking of this one subject. But children led so easy a life before\r\nany Troubles came into the world that they find really a great deal\r\ntoo much leisure. They could not be forever playing at hide-and-seek\r\namong the flower-shrubs, or at blind-man\'s buff with garlands over\r\ntheir eyes, or at whatever other games has been found out while Mother\r\nEarth was in her babyhood.\r\n\r\nWhen life is all sport, toil is the real play. There was absolutely\r\nnothing to do. A little sweeping and dusting about the cottage, I\r\nsuppose, and the gathering of fresh flowers (which were only too\r\nabundant everywhere), and arranging them in vases--and poor little\r\nPandora\'s day\'s work was over. And then, for the rest of the day,\r\nthere was the box!\r\n\r\nAfter all. I am not quite sure that the box was not a blessing to her\r\nin its way. It supplied her with so many ideas to think of, and to\r\ntalk about, whenever she had anybody to listen! When she was in good\r\nhumor, she could admire the bright polish of its sides and the rich\r\nborder of beautiful faces and foliage that ran all around it. Or, if\r\nshe chanced to be ill-tempered, she could give it a push, or kick it\r\nwith her naughty little foot. And many a kick did the box (but it was\r\na mischievous box, as we shall see, and deserved all it got) many a\r\nkick did it receive. But certain it is, if it had not been for the\r\nbox, our active-minded little Pandora would not have known half so\r\nwell how to spend her time as she now did.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUESSING WHAT WAS IN THE BOX\r\n\r\nFor it was really an endless employment to guess what was inside. What\r\ncould it be, indeed? Just imagine, my little hearers, how busy your\r\nwits would be if there were a great box in the house, which, as you\r\nmight have reason to suppose, contained something new and pretty for\r\nyour Christmas or New Year\'s gifts. Do you think that you should be\r\nless curious than Pandora? If you were left alone with the box, might\r\nyou not feel a little tempted to lift the lid? But you would not do\r\nit. Oh, fie! No, no!

But Pandora was\r\nconvinced that there was something very beautiful and valuable in the\r\nbox; and therefore she felt just as anxious to take a peep as any\r\nof these little girls here around me would have felt. For it was\r\nimpossible, as you will easily guess, that the two children should\r\nkeep the ugly swarm in their own little cottage. On the contrary, the\r\nfirst thing that they did was to fling open the doors and windows in\r\nhope of getting rid of them; and, sure enough, away flew the winged\r\nTroubles all abroad, and so pestered and tormented the small people,\r\neverywhere about, that none of them so much as smiled for many days\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nAnd, what was very singular, all the flowers and dewy blossoms on\r\nearth, not one of which had hitherto faded, now began to droop and\r\nshed their leaves, after a day or two. The children, moreover, who\r\nbefore seemed immortal in their childhood, now grew older, day by day,\r\nand came soon to be youths and maidens, and men and women by-and-by,\r\nand aged people, before they dreamed of such a thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HOPE DOES FOR US\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the naughty Pandora and hardly less naughty Epimetheus\r\nremained in their cottage. Both of them had been grievously stung,\r\nand were in a good deal of pain, which, seemed the more adorable\r\nintolerable to them, because it was the very first pain that had\r\never been felt since the world began. Of course they were entirely\r\nunaccustomed to it, and could have no idea what it meant. Besides all\r\nthis, they were in exceedingly bad humor, both with themselves and\r\nwith one another. In order to indulge it to the utmost, Epimetheus sat\r\ndown sullenly in a corner with his back toward Pandora; while Pandora\r\nflung herself upon the floor and rested her head on the fatal box. She\r\nwas crying bitterly, and sobbing as if her heart would break.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was gentle little tap on the inside of the lid.\r\n\r\n"What can that be?" cried Pandora, lifting her head.\r\n\r\nBut either Epimetheus had not heard the tap, or was too much out of\r\nhumor to notice it. At any rate, he made no answer.\r\n\r\n"You are very unkind," said Pandora, sobbing anew, "not to speak to\r\nme!"\r\n\r\nAgain the tap! It sounded like the tiny knuckles of a fairy\'s hand,\r\nknocking lightly and playfully on the inside of the box.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" asked Pandora, with a little of her former curiosity.\r\n"Who are you, inside of this naughty box?"\r\n\r\nA sweet little voice spoke from within: "Only lift the lid, and you\r\nshall see."\r\n\r\n"No, no," answered Pandora, again beginning to sob, "I have had enough\r\nof lifting the lid! You are inside of the box, naughty creature, and\r\nthere you shall stay! There are plenty of your ugly brothers and\r\nsisters already flying about the world. You need never think that I\r\nshall be so foolish as to let you out!"\r\n\r\nShe looked toward Epimetheus as she spoke, perhaps expecting that he\r\nwould commend her for her wisdom. But the sullen boy only muttered\r\nthat she was wise a little too late.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said the sweet little voice again. "You had much better let me\r\nout. I am not like those naughty creatures that have stings in their\r\ntails. They are no brothers and sisters of mine, as you would see at\r\nonce, if you were only to get a glimpse of me. Come, come, my pretty\r\nPandora! I am sure you will let me out!"\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, there was a kind of cheerful witchery in the tone that\r\nmade it almost impossible to refuse anything which this little voice\r\nasked. Pandora\'s heart had grown lighter at every word that came from\r\nwithin the box. Epimetheus, too, though still in the corner, had\r\nturned half round, and seemed to be in rather better spirits than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"My dear Epimetheus," cried Pandora, "have you heard this little\r\nvoice?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure I have," answered he, but in no very good humor as\r\nyes. "And what of it?"\r\n\r\n"Shall I lift the lid again?" asked Pandora.\r\n\r\n"Just as you please," said Epimetheus. "You have done so much mischief\r\nalready that perhaps you may as well do a little more. One other\r\nTrouble, in such a swarm as you have set adrift about the world, can\r\nmake no very great difference."\r\n\r\n"You might speak a little more kindly!" murmured Pandora, wiping her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Ah, naughty boy!" cried the little voice within the box, in an arch\r\nand laughing tone. "He knows he is longing to see me. Come, my dear\r\nPandora, lift up the lid. I am in a great hurry to comfort you. Only\r\nlet me have some fresh air, and you shall soon see that matters are\r\nnot quite so dismal as you think them!"\r\n\r\n"Epimetheus," exclaimed Pandora, "come what may, I am resolved to open\r\nthe box!"\r\n\r\n"And, as the lid seems very heavy," cried Epimetheus, running across\r\nthe room, "I will help you!"\r\n\r\nSo, with one consent, the children again lifted the lid. Out flew\r\na sunny and smiling little personage, and hovered about the room,\r\nthrowing a light wherever she went. Have you never made the sunshine\r\ndance into dark corners by reflecting it from a bit of looking-glass?\r\nWell, so looked the winged cheerfulness of this fairy-like stranger\r\namid the gloom of the cottage. She flew to Epimetheus and laid the\r\nleast touch of her finger on the inflamed spot where the Trouble had\r\nstung him, and immediately the anguish of it was gone. Then she kissed\r\nPandora on the forehead, and her hurt was cured likewise.\r\n\r\nAfter performing these good offices, the bright stranger fluttered\r\nsportively over the children\'s heads, and looked so sweetly at them\r\nthat they both began to think it not so very much amiss to have opened\r\nthe box, since, otherwise, their cheery guest must have been kept a\r\nprisoner among those naughty imps with stings in their tails.\r\n\r\n"Pray, who are you, beautiful creature?" inquired Pandora.\r\n\r\n"I am to be called Hope!" answered the sunshiny figure. "And because\r\nI am such a cheery little body, I was packed into the box, to make\r\namends to the human race for that swarm of ugly Troubles, which was\r\ndestined to be let loose among them. Never fear! We shall do pretty\r\nwell in spite of them all."\r\n\r\n"Your wings are colored like the rainbow!" exclaimed Pandora. "How\r\nvery beautiful!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, they are like the rainbow," said Hope, "because, glad as my\r\nnature is, I am partly made of tears as well as smiles."\r\n\r\n"And will you stay with us," asked Epimetheus, "for ever and ever?"\r\n\r\n"As long as you need me," said Hope, with her pleasant smile, "and\r\nthat will be as long as you live in the world. I promise never to\r\nleave you. There may be times and seasons, now and then, when you will\r\nthink that I have utterly vanished. But again, and again, and again,\r\nwhen perhaps you least dream of it, you shall see the glimmer of my\r\nwings on the ceiling of your cottage. Yes, my dear children, and\r\nI know something very good and beautiful that is to be Given you\r\nhereafter!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, tell us," they exclaimed; "tell us what it is!"\r\n\r\n"Do not ask me," replied Hope, patting her finger on her rosy mouth.\r\n"But do not despair, even if it should never happen while you live on\r\nthis earth. Trust in my promise, for it is true."\r\n\r\n"We do trust you!" cried Epimetheus and Pandora, both in one breath.\r\n\r\nAnd so they did; and not only they, but so has everybody trusted Hope,\r\nthat has since been alive. And, to tell You the truth, I cannot help\r\nbeing glad (though to be sure It was an uncommonly naughty thing for\r\nher to do) but I Cannot help being glad that our foolish Pandora\r\npeeped into the box. No doubt--no doubt--the Troubles are still flying\r\nabout the world, and have increased in numbers, rather than lessened,\r\nand are a very ugly set of imps, and carry most venomous stings in\r\ntheir tails. I have felt them already, and expect to feel them more\r\nas I grow older. But then that lovely and lightsome little figure of\r\nHope! What in the world could we do without her? Hope spiritualizes\r\nthe earth; Hope makes it always new; and, even in the earth\xc2\x92s best and\r\nbrightest aspect, Hope shows it to be only the shadow of an infinite\r\nbliss hereafter!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

THE GOLDEN TOUCH\r\n\r\nKING MIDAS AND HIS LOVE FOR GOLD\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there lived a very rich man, and a King besides,\r\nwhose name was Midas; and he had a little daughter, whom nobody but\r\nmyself ever heard of, and whose name I either never knew, or have\r\nentirely forgotten. So, because I love odd name for little girls, I\r\nchoose to call her Marygold.\r\n\r\nThis King Midas was fonder of gold than of anything else in the world.\r\nHe valued his royal crown chiefly because it was composed of that\r\nprecious metal. If he loved anything better, or half so well, it\r\nwas the one little maiden who played so merrily around her father\'s\r\nfootstool. But the more Midas loved his daughter, the more did he\r\ndesire and seek for wealth. He thought, foolish man, that the best\r\nthing he could possibly do for his dear child would be to give her the\r\nimmensest pile of yellow, glistening coin that had ever been heaped\r\ntogether since the world was make. Thus, he gave all his thoughts and\r\nall his time to this one Purpose. If ever he happened to gaze for an\r\ninstant at the gold-tinted clouds of sunset, he wished that they were\r\nreal gold and that they could be squeezed safely into his strong box.\r\nWhen little Marygold ran to meet him, with a bunch of buttercups and\r\ndandelions, he used to say, "Pooh, pooh, child! If these flowers were\r\na golden as they look, they would be worth the plucking!"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in his earlier days, before he was so entirely possessed of\r\nthis insane desire for riches, King Midas had shown a great taste\r\nfor flowers. He had planted a garden, in which grew the biggest and\r\nbeautifulest and sweetest roses that any mortal ever saw or smelled.\r\nThese roses were still growing in the garden, as large, as lovely, and\r\nas fragrant as when Midas used to pass whole hours in gazing at the\r\nand inhaling their perfume. But now, if he looked at them at all, it\r\nwas only to calculate how much the garden would be worth if each of\r\nthe many rose-petals were a thin plate of gold.\r\n\r\nAt length (as people always grow more and more foolish, unless they\r\ntake care to grow wiser and wiser) Midas had got to be so exceedingly\r\nunreasonable that he could scarcely bear to see or touch any object\r\nthat was not gold. He made it his custom, therefore, to pass a large\r\nportion of every day in a dark and dreary apartment, underground, at\r\nthe basement of the palace. It was here that he kept his wealth. To\r\nthis dismal hole "for it was little better than a dungeon" Midas betook\r\nhimself whenever he wanted to be particularly happy. Here, after\r\ncarefully locking the door, he would take a bag of gold coin, or\r\na gold cup as big as a washbowl, or a heavy golden bar, or a\r\npeck-measure of gold-dust, and bring them from the obscure corners of\r\nthe room into the one bright and narrow sunbeam that fell from the\r\ndungeon-like window. He valued the sunbeam for no other reason but\r\nthat his treasure would not shine without its help. And then would he\r\nreckon over the coins in the bag; toss up the bar, and catch it as it\r\ncame down; sift the gold-dust through his fingers; look at the funny\r\nimage of his own face, as reflected in the polished surface of the\r\ncup; and whisper to himself, "O Midas, rich King Midas, what a happy\r\nman art thou!"\r\n\r\nMidas was enjoying himself in his treasure-room one Day as usual, when\r\nhe saw a shadow fall over the heaps of Gold; and, looking suddenly up,\r\nwhat should he behold but The figure of a strange, standing in the\r\nbright and narrow Sunbeam! It was a young man with a cheerful and\r\nruddy face. Whether it was that the imagination of King Midas threw a\r\nyellow tinge over everything, or whatever the cause might be, he could\r\nnot help fancying that the smile with which the stranger regarded him\r\nhad a kind of golden radiance in it.\r\n\r\nAs Midas knew that he had carefully turned the key in The lock, and\r\nthat no mortal strength could possibly break Into his treasure-room,\r\nhe of course concluded that his Visitor must be something more than\r\nmortal. It is no matter about telling you who he was. In those days,\r\nwhen the earth was comparatively a new affair, it was supposed to be\r\noften the resort of beings who had extraordinary powers, and who used\r\nto interest themselves in the joys and sorrows of men, women, and\r\nchildren, half playfully and half seriously, Midas had met such\r\nbeings before now, and was not sorry to meet one of them again. The\r\nstranger\'s manner, indeed, was so good-humored and kindly that it\r\nwould have been unreasonable to suspect him of intending any mischief.\r\nIt was far more probable that he came to do Midas a favor. And what\r\ncould that favor be, unless to multiply his heaps of treasure?\r\n\r\nThe stranger gazed about the room; and when his bright smile had\r\nglistened upon all the golden objects that were there, he turned again\r\nto Midas.\r\n\r\n"You are a wealthy man, friend Midas!" he observed. "I doubt whether\r\nany other four walls on earth contain so much gold as you have piled\r\nup in this room."\r\n\r\n"I have done pretty well pretty well," answered Midas, in a\r\ndiscontented tone. "But, after all, it is but a trifle, when you\r\nconsider that it has taken me my whole life to get it together. If one\r\ncould live a thousand years, he might have time to grow rich!"\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed the stranger. "Then you are not satisfied?" Midas\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n"And pray what would satisfy you?" asked the stranger. "Merely for the\r\ncuriosity of the thing I should be glad to know."\r\n\r\nMidas paused and meditated. He had a feeling that his stranger, with\r\nsuch a golden luster in his good-humored smile, had come hither with\r\nboth the power and the purpose of gratifying his utmost wishes. Now,\r\ntherefore, was the fortunate moment when he had but to speak and\r\nobtain whatever possible, or seemingly impossible, thing it might\r\ncome into his head to ask. So he thought and thought and thought,\r\nand heaped up one golden mountain upon another in this imagination,\r\nwithout being able to imagine them big enough. At last, a bright idea\r\noccurred to King Midas. It seemed really as bright as the glistening\r\nmetal which he loved so much.\r\n\r\nRaising his head, he looked the lustrous stranger in the face.\r\n\r\n"Well, Midas," observed his visitor. "I see that you have at length\r\nhit upon something that will satisfy you. Tell me your wish."\r\n\r\n"It is only this," Replied Midas. "I am weary of collecting my\r\ntreasures with so much trouble, and beholding the heap so small after\r\nI have done my best. I wish everything that I touch to be changed to\r\ngold!"\r\n\r\nThe stranger\'s smile grew so very broad that it seemed to fill the\r\nroom like an outburst of the sun gleaming into a shadowy dell where\r\nthe yellow autumnal leaves--for so looked the lumps and particles of\r\ngold--lie strewn in the glow of light.\r\n\r\n"The Golden Touch!" exclaimed he. "You certainly deserve credit,\r\nfriend Midas, for striking out so brilliant an idea. But are you quite\r\nsure that this will satisfy you?"\r\n\r\n"How could it fail?" said Midas.\r\n\r\n"And will you never regret the possession of it?"\r\n\r\n"What could induce me?" asked Midas. "I ask nothing else to render me\r\nperfectly happy."\r\n\r\n"Be it as you wish, then," replied the stranger, waving his hand in\r\ntoken of farewell. "Tomorrow, at sunrise, you will find yourself\r\ngifted with the Golden touch."\r\n\r\nThe figure of the stranger then became exceedingly bright, and Midas\r\nwas forced to close his eyes. On opening them again he beheld only one\r\nyellow sunbeam in the room, and, all around him, the glistening of the\r\nprecious metal which he had spent his life in hoarding up.\r\n\r\nWhether Midas slept as usual that night, the story does not say.\r\nAsleep or awake, however, his mind was probably in the state of a\r\nchild\'s to whom a beautiful new plaything has been promised in the\r\nmorning. At any rate, day had hardly peeped over the hills when King\r\nMidas was broad awake, and stretching his arms out of bed, began to\r\ntouch the objects that were within reach. He was anxious to prove\r\nwhether the Golden Touch had really come, according to the stranger\'s\r\npromise. So he laid his finger on a chair by the bedside, and on\r\nvarious other things, but was grievously disappointed to perceive that\r\nthey remained of exactly the same substance as before.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIFT OF THE GOLDEN TOUCH\r\n\r\nAll this while, it was only the gray of the morning, with but a streak\r\nof brightness along the edge of the sky, where Midas could not see it.\r\nHe lay in a very unhappy mood, regretting the downfall of his hopes,\r\nand kept growing sadder and sadder, until the earliest sunbeam shone\r\nthrough the window and gilded the ceiling over his head. It seemed\r\nto Midas that this bright yellow sunbeam was reflected in rather a\r\nsingular way on the white covering of the bed. Looking more closely,\r\nwhat was his astonishment and delight, when he found that this linen\r\nfabric wad been changed to what seemed a woven texture of the purest\r\nand brightest gold! The Golden Touch had come to him with the first\r\nsunbeam!\r\n\r\nMidas started up, in a kind of joyful frenzy, and ran about the room\r\ngrasping at everything that happened to be in his way. He seized one\r\nof the bed-posts, and it became immediately a fluted golden pillar. He\r\npulled aside a window-curtain in order to admit a clear spectacle of\r\nthe wonders which he was performing; and the tassel grew heavy in his\r\nhand--a mass of gold. He took up a book from the table. At this first\r\ntouch, it assumed the appearance of such a splendidly-bound and\r\ngilt-edged volume as one often meets with nowadays; but, on running\r\nhis fingers through the leaves, behold! It was a bundle of thin golden\r\nplates, in which all the wisdom of the book had grown in distinct.\r\nHe hurriedly put on his clothes, and was delighted to ace himself in\r\nmagnificent suit of gold cloth, which retained its flexibility and\r\nsoftness, although it burdened him a little with its weight.\r\n\r\nWise King Midas was so excited by his good fortune that the palace\r\nseemed not sufficiently spacious to contain him. He therefore went\r\ndownstairs and smiled on observing that the balustrade of the\r\nstaircase became a bar of burnished gold as his hand passed over it in\r\nthe descent. He lifted the door latch (it was brass only a moment ago,\r\nbut golden when his fingers quitted it) and went into the garden.\r\nHere, as it happened, he found a great number of beautiful roses in\r\nfull bloom, and others in all the stages of lovely bud and blossom.\r\nVery delicious was their fragrance in the morning breeze. Their\r\ndelicate blush was one of the fairest sights in the world--so gentle,\r\nso modest, and so full of erect composure did these roses seem to be.\r\n\r\nBut Midas knew a way to make them far more precious, according to his\r\nway of thinking, than roses had ever been before. So he took great\r\npains in going from bush to bush, and exercised his magic touch most\r\nfreely; until every individual flower and bud, and even the worms at\r\nthe heart of some of them, were changed to gold. By the time this good\r\nwork was completed, King Midas was called to breakfast; and, as the\r\nmorning air had given him an excellent appetite, he made haste back to\r\nthe palace.\r\n\r\nWhat was usually a king\'s breakfast, in the days of Midas, I really do\r\nnot know, and cannot stop now to find out. To the best of my belief,\r\nhowever, on this particular morning, the breakfast consisted of hot\r\ncakes, some nice little brook-trout, roasted potatoes, fresh boiled\r\neggs, and coffee, for King Midas himself, and a bowl of bread and milk\r\nfor his daughter Marygold. At all events, this is a breakfast fit to\r\nbe set before a king; and, whether he had it or not, King Midas could\r\nnot have had a better.\r\n\r\nLittle Marygold had not yet made her appearance. Her father ordered\r\nher to be called, and, seating himself at table, awaited the child\'s\r\ncoming, in order to begin his own breakfast. To do Midas justice, he\r\nreally loved his daughter, and loved her so much the more this morning\r\non account of the good fortune which had befallen him. It was not\r\na great while before he heard her coming along the passage crying\r\nbitterly. This circumstance surprised him, because Marygold was one of\r\nthe cheerfulest little people whom you would see in a summer day, and\r\nhardly shed a thimbleful of tears in a twelvemonth. When Midas heard\r\nher sobs, he determined to put little Marygold into better spirits by\r\nan agreeable surprise; so, leaning across the table, he touched his\r\ndaughter\'s bowl (which was a china one, with pretty figures all around\r\nit) and turned it to gleaming gold.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Marygold slowly and sadly opened the door, and showed\r\nherself with her apron at her eyes, still sobbing as if her heart\r\nwould break.\r\n\r\n"How now, my little lady!" cried Midas. "Pray what is the matter with\r\nyou this bright morning?"\r\n\r\nMarygold, without taking the apron from her eyes, held out her hand,\r\nin which was one of the roses which Midas had so recently changed.\r\n\r\n"Beautiful!" exclaimed her father. "And what is there in this\r\nmagnificent golden rose to make you cry?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, dear father!" answered the child, as well as her sobs would let\r\nher, "it is not beautiful, but the ugliest flower that ever grew! As\r\nsoon as I was dressed, I ran into the garden to gather some roses\r\nfor you, because I know you like them, and like them the better when\r\ngathered by your little daughter. But, O dear, dear me! What do you\r\nthink has happened? Such a misfortune! All the beautiful roses, that\r\nsmelled so sweet and had so many lovely blushes, are blighted and\r\nspoiled! They are grown quite yellow, as you see this one, and have no\r\nlonger any fragrance! What can have been the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Pooh, my dear little girl, pray don\'t cry about it!" said Midas, who\r\nwas ashamed to confess that he himself had wrought the change which so\r\ngreatly afflicted her. "Sit down and eat your bread and milk! You will\r\nfind it easy enough to exchange a golden rose like that (which will\r\nlast hundreds of years) for an ordinary one, which would wither in a\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care for such roses as this!" cried Marygold. "It has no\r\nsmell, and hard petals prick my nose!"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING\'S BREAKFAST OF GOLD\r\n\r\nThe child now sat down to table, but was so occupied with her grief\r\nfor the blighted roses that she did not even notice the wonderful\r\nchange of her china bowl. Perhaps this was all the better; for\r\nMarygold was accustomed to take pleasure in looking at the queer\r\nfigures and strange trees and houses that were painted on the outside\r\nof the bowl; and those ornaments were now entirely lost in the yellow\r\nhue of the metal.\r\n\r\nMidas, meanwhile, had poured out a cup of coffee; and, as a matter of\r\ncourse, the coffee-pot, whatever metal it may have been when he took\r\nit up, was gold when he set it down. He thought to himself that it\r\nwas rather an extravagant style of splendor, in a king of his simple\r\nhabits, to breakfast off a service of gold, and began to be puzzled\r\nwith the difficulty of keeping his treasures safe. The cupboard and\r\nthe kitchen would no longer be a safe place of deposit for articles so\r\nvaluable as golden bowls and coffee-pots.\r\n\r\nAmid these thoughts, he lifted a spoonful of coffee to his lips, and\r\nsipping it, was astonished to perceive that, the instant his lips\r\ntouched the liquid, it became molten gold, and, the next moment,\r\nhardened into a lump!\r\n\r\n"Ha!" exclaimed Midas, rather aghast.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, father?" asked little Marygold, gazing at him,\r\nwith tears still standing in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, child, nothing!" said Midas. "Eat your bread and milk before\r\nit gets quite cold."\r\n\r\nHe took one of the nice little trout on his plate, and, by way of\r\nexperiment, touched its tail with his finger. To his horror, it was\r\nimmediately changed from an admirably-fried brook-trout into a gold\r\nfish, though not one of those goldfish which people often keep in\r\nglass globes, as ornaments for the parlor. No; but it was really a\r\nmetallic fish, and looked as if it had been very cunningly made by the\r\nnicest goldsmith in the world. Its little bones were now golden wires;\r\nits fins and tail were thin plates of gold; and there were the marks\r\nof the fork in it, and all the delicate, frothy appearance of a nicely\r\nfried fish, exactly imitated in metal. A very pretty piece of work, as\r\nyou may suppose; only King Midas just at the that moment would much\r\nrather have had a real trout in his dish than his elaborate and\r\nvaluable imitation of one.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite see," thought he to himself, "how I am to get any\r\nbreakfast!"\r\n\r\nHe took one of the smoking hot cakes, and had scarcely broken it,\r\nwhen, to his cruel mortification, though a moment before it had been\r\nof the whitest wheat, it assumed the yellow hue of Indian meal. To say\r\nthe truth, if it had really been a hot Indian cake, Midas would have\r\nprized it a good deal more than he now did, when its solidity and\r\nincreased weight made him know too well that it was old. Almost\r\nin despair, he helped himself to a boiled egg, which immediately\r\nunderwent a change similar to that of the trout and the cake. The egg,\r\nindeed, might have been mistaken for one of those which the famous\r\ngoose, in the story-book, was in the habit of laying; but King Midas\r\nwas the only goose that had had anything to do with the matter.\r\n\r\n"Well, this is a puzzle!" thought he, leaning back in his chair, and\r\nlooking quite enviously at little Marygold, who was now eating her\r\nbread and milk with great satisfaction. "Such a costly breakfast, and\r\nnothing that can be eaten!"\r\n\r\nHoping that, by dint of great quickness, he might avoid what he now\r\nfelt to be a considerable inconvenience, King Midas next snatched a\r\nhot potato, and attempted to cram It into his mouth and swallow it in\r\nhurry. But the Golden Touch was too nimble for him. He found his mouth\r\nfull, not of mealy potato, but of solid metal, which so burned his tongue\r\nthat he roared aloud, and, jumping up from the table, began to dance\r\nand stamp about the room, both with pain and affright.\r\n\r\n"Father, dear father!" cried little Marygold, who was a very\r\naffectionate child, "pray, what is the matter? Have you burned your\r\nmouth?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, dear child," groaned Midas, dolefully, "I don\'t know what is to\r\nbecome of your poor father!"\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, my dear little folks, did you ever hear of such a pitiable\r\ncase in all your lives? Here was literally the richest breakfast that\r\ncould be set before a king, and its very richness made it absolutely\r\ngood for nothing. The poorest laborer, sitting down to his crust of\r\nbread and cup of water, was far better off than King Midas, whose\r\ndelicate food was really worth its weight in gold. And what was to be\r\ndone? Already, at breakfast, Midas was very hungry. Would he be less\r\nso by dinner-time? And how ravenous would be his appetite for supper,\r\nwhich must undoubtedly consist of the same sort of indigestible dishes\r\nas those now before him! How many days, think you, would he survive\r\nthe fate of this rich fare?\r\n\r\nThese thoughts so troubled wise King Midas that he began to doubt\r\nwhether, after all, riches are the one desirable thing in the world;\r\nor even the most desirable. But this was only a passing thought. So\r\npleased was Midas with the glitter of the yellow metal that he\r\nwould still have refused to give up the Golden Touch for so small a\r\nconsideration as a breakfast. Just imagine what a price for one meal\'s\r\nvictuals! It would have been the same as paying millions and millions\r\nof money (and as many millions more as would take forever to reckon\r\nup) for some fried trout, an egg, a potato, a hot cake, and a cup of\r\ncoffee!\r\n\r\n"It would be quite too dear," thought Midas.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, so great was his hunger and perplexity of this\r\nsituation, that he again groaned aloud, and very grievously too. Our\r\npretty Marygold could endure it no longer. She sat a moment gazing at\r\nher father, and trying, with all the might of her little wits, to find\r\nout what was the matter with him. Then, with a sweet and sorrowful\r\nimpulse to comfort him, she started from the chair, and running to\r\nMidas, threw her arms affectionately about his knees. He bent down\r\nand kissed her. He felt that his little daughter\'s love was worth a\r\nthousand times more than he had gained by the Golden Touch.\r\n\r\n"My precious, precious Marygold!" cried he.\r\n\r\nBut Marygold made no answer.\r\n\r\nAlas, what had he done? How fatal was the gift which the stranger\r\ngave! The moment the lips of Midas touched Marygold\'s forehead, a\r\nchange had taken place. Her sweet, rosy face, so full of affection as\r\nit had been, assumed a glittering yellow color, with yellow tear-drops\r\nhardening on her cheeks. Her beautiful brown ringlets took the same\r\ntint. Her soft and tender little form grew hard and stiff within her\r\nfather\'s encircling arms. O terrible misfortune! The victim of his\r\ngreat desire for wealth, little Marygold was human child no longer,\r\nbut a golden statue!\r\n\r\nYes, there she was, with the questioning look of love, grief, and\r\npity, hardened into her face. It was the prettiest and most woeful\r\nsight that ever mortal saw. All the features and tokens of Marygold\r\nwere there; even the beloved little dimple remained in her golden\r\nchin. But, the more perfect was the resemblance, the greater was the\r\nfather\'s agony at beholding this golden image, which was all that\r\nwas left him of a daughter. It had been a favorite phrase of Midas,\r\nwhenever he felt particularly fond of the child, to say that she was\r\nworth her weight in gold. And how the phrase had become literally true.\r\nAnd now, at last, when it was too late, he felt how infinitely a warm\r\nand tender heart that loved him exceeded in value all the wealth that\r\ncould be piled up betwixt the earth and sky!\r\n\r\nIt would be too sad a story if I were to tell you how Midas, in the\r\nfullness of all his gratified desires, began to Wring his hands and\r\nbemoan himself; and how he could neither bear to look at Marygold, nor\r\nyet to look away from her.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT KING MIDAS LEARNED\r\n\r\nWhile he was in this despair, he suddenly beheld a stranger, standing\r\nnear the door. Midas bent down his head, without speaking; for he\r\nrecognized the same figure which had appeared to him the day before in\r\nthe treasure-room, and had bestowed on him this unlucky power of the\r\nGolden Touch. The stranger\'s countenance still wore a smile, which\r\nSeemed to shed a yellow luster all about the room, and Gleamed on\r\nlittle Marygold\'s image, and on the other Objects that had been\r\nchanged by the touch of Midas.\r\n\r\n"Well, friend Midas," said the stranger, "pray how do you succeed with\r\nthe Golden Touch?"\r\n\r\nMidas shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I am very miserable," said he.\r\n\r\n"Very miserable, indeed!" exclaimed the stranger. "And how happens\r\nthat? Have I not faithfully kept my promise with you? Have you not\r\neverything that your heart desired?"\r\n\r\n"Gold is not everything," answered Midas. "And I have lost all that my\r\nheart really cared for."\r\n\r\n"Ah! So you have made a discovery since yesterday?" observed the\r\nstranger. "Let us see, then. Which of these two things do you think\r\nis really worth the more--the gift of the Golden Touch, or one cup of\r\nclear cold water?"\r\n\r\n"O blessed water!" exclaimed Midas. "It will never moisten my parched\r\nthroat again!"\r\n\r\n"The Golden Touch," continued the stranger, "or a crust of bread?"\r\n\r\n"A piece of bread," answered Midas, "is worth all the gold on earth!"\r\n\r\n"The Golden Touch," asked the stranger, "or your own little Marygold,\r\nwarm, soft, and loving, as she was an hour ago?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my child, my dear child, my dear child!" cried poor Midas,\r\nwringing his hands. "I would not have given that one small dimple in\r\nher chin for the power of changing his whole big earth into a solid\r\nlump of gold!"\r\n\r\n"You are wiser than you were, King Midas!" said the stranger, looking\r\nseriously at him. "Your own heart, I perceive, has not been entirely\r\nchanged from flesh to gold. Were it so, your ease would indeed be\r\ndesperate. But you appear to be still capable of understanding that\r\nthe commonest things, such as lie within everybody\'s grasp, are more\r\nvaluable than the riches which so many mortals sigh and struggle\r\nafter. Tell me, now, do you sincerely desire to rid yourself of this\r\nGolden Touch?"\r\n\r\n"It is hateful to me!" replied Midas.\r\n\r\nA fly settled on his nose, but immediately fell to the Floor; for it,\r\nto had become gold. Midas shuddered.\r\n\r\n"Go, then," said the stranger, "and plunge into the river that glides\r\npast the bottom of the your garden. Take likewise a vase of the same\r\nwater, and sprinkle it over any object that you may desire to change\r\nback again from gold into its former substance. If you do this in\r\nearnestness and sincerity, it may possibly repair the mischief which\r\nyour avarice has occasioned."\r\n\r\nKing Midas bowed low; and when he lifted his head, The lustrous\r\nstranger had vanished.\r\n\r\nYou will easily believe that Midas lost no time in snatching up a\r\ngreat earthen pitcher (but, alas! It was no longer earthen after he\r\ntouched it) and hastening to the riverside. As he scampered along, and\r\nforced his way through the shrubbery, it was positively marvelous to\r\nsee how the foliage turned yellow behind him, as if the autumn had\r\nbeen there, and nowhere else. On reaching the river\'s brink, he\r\nplunged headlong in, without waiting so much as to pull off his shoes.\r\n\r\n"Poof! Poof! Poof!" snorted King Midas, as his head emerged out of the\r\nwater. "Well, this is really a refreshing bath, and I think it must\r\nhave quite washed away the Golden Touch. And now for filling my\r\npitcher!"\r\n\r\nAs he dipped the pitcher into the water, it gladdened his very heart\r\nto see it change from gold into the same good, honest earthen vessel\r\nwhich it had been before he touched it. He was conscious, also, of a\r\nchange within himself. A cold, hard, and heavy weight seemed to have\r\ngone out of his bosom. No doubt his heart had been gradually losing\r\nits human substance, and changing itself into dull metal, but had now\r\nsoftened back again into flesh. Seeing a violet that grew on the bank\r\nof the river, Midas touched it with his finger, and was overjoyed to\r\nfind that the delicate flower retained its purple hue, instead of\r\nundergoing a yellow blight. The curse of the Golden Touch had,\r\ntherefore, really been removed from him.\r\n\r\nKing Midas hastened back to the palace; and, I suppose, the servants\r\nknew not what to make of it when they saw their royal master so\r\ncarefully bringing home an earthen pitcher of water. But that water,\r\nwhich was to undo all the mischief that his folly had wrought, was\r\nmore precious to Midas than an ocean of molten gold could have been.\r\nThe first thing he did, as you nee hardly be told, was to sprinkle it\r\nby handfuls over the golden figure of little Marygold.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did it fall on her than you would have laughed to see how\r\nthe rosy color came back to the dear child\'s cheek!--and how she began\r\nto sneeze and splutter!--and how astonished she was to find herself\r\ndripping wet, and her father still throwing more water over her!\r\n\r\n"Pray, do not, dear father!" cried she. "See how you have wet my nice\r\nfrock, which I put on only this morning!"\r\n\r\nFor Marygold did not know that she had been a little golden statue;\r\nnor could she remember anything that had happened since the moment\r\nwhen she ran, with outstretched arms, to comfort poor King Midas.\r\n\r\nHer father did not think it necessary to tell his beloved child how\r\nvery foolish he had been, but contented himself with showing how much\r\nwiser he had now grown. For this purpose he led little Marygold into\r\nthe garden, where he sprinkled all the remainder of the water over\r\nthe rosebushes recovered their beautiful bloom. There were two\r\ncircumstances, however, which, as long as he lived, used to put King\r\nMidas in mind of the Golden Touch. One was that the sands of the river\r\nsparkled like gold; the other that little Marygold\'s hair had now a\r\ngolden tinge, which he had never observed in it before she had been\r\nchanged by the effect of his kiss. This change of hue was really an\r\nimprovement, and made Marygold\'s hair richer than in her babyhood.\r\n\r\nWhen King Midas had grown quite an old man, and used to trot\r\nMarygold\'s children on his knee, he was fond of telling them this\r\nmarvelous story, pretty much as I have now told it to your. And then\r\nwould he stroke their glossy ringlets, and tell them that their hair,\r\nlikewise, had a rich shade of gold, which they had inherited from\r\ntheir mother.\r\n\r\n"And to tell you the truth, my precious little folks," quoth King\r\nMidas, diligently trotting the children all the while, "ever since\r\nthat morning I have hated the very sight of all other gold save\r\nthis!"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nDiscussion. 1.

Through its power the great\r\nheroes of all ages--Joseph, Beowulf, Sigurd, Robin Hood, and our own\r\nWashington, Lincoln, and Roosevelt--become your companions.\r\n\r\nSomeone has said that the pen is mightier than the sword, which is\r\nanother way of saying that great books have had more to do in shaping\r\nthe lives and fortunes of men than bloody battles. The group of\r\nauthors whose stories and poems you have just been reading is a\r\ncompany of friends whose thoughts about Nature, or about life and its\r\nmeaning, have been a power in making America what it is today.\r\n\r\nAcquaintance with these friends has been made easy for you; you have\r\nhad placed before you their pictures and interesting facts about their\r\nlives, and best of all, you have been able to hear them tell their own\r\nthoughts. What authors are in this group? Which of them did you learn\r\nto know in Book IV and which were new to you in this book? Close\r\nyour eyes and see whether your "inward eye" can picture the faces of\r\nFranklin, Bryant, Whittier, Irving, Longfellow, Hawthorne. Make one\r\ninteresting statement concerning each author and his works. Quote\r\nlines from poems by Bryant, Whittier, and Longfellow. Make from memory\r\na list of title of stories or poems you have read from each of these\r\nsix American authors.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin founded the first public library in America; the\r\npicture on page 18 shows you what a library must have been like in\r\nthe old Greek days, and page 288 pictures a view of the Congressional\r\nLibrary at Washington, the home of the complete works of all our\r\nAmerican authors. The building is considered one of the most beautiful\r\nin the world; report to the class some interesting facts about this\r\nlibrary that you have learned from someone who has seen it.\r\n\r\nIn the last paragraph of the Forward Look, you are asked to notice the\r\nway in which authors tell what they have to say. When Franklin was a\r\nyoung boy he was not at all satisfied with his way of writing, so\r\nhe sat himself the task of noticing carefully how a certain English\r\nwriter, whom he admired very much, expressed himself, and tried to\r\npattern after him. Notice how Franklin made the story "An Ax to Grind"\r\nseem very real by using direct quotations; where else has he used\r\ndirect quotations with the same result?\r\n\r\nNotice the way Hawthorne added interest to his stories: (a) by touches\r\nof fancy; (b) by delicate humor; (c) by apt descriptions. Point out\r\nexamples of each of these qualities in "The Paradise of Children."\r\nMake a similar showing for "The Golden Touch." Compare the two stories\r\nin regard to each of These qualities.\r\n\r\nTurn to the pictures on pages 282, 297, 302, 321, and 309, and see\r\nwhether you are able to tell what selection each panel-picture\r\nillustrates. You have read many stories in this book that show how\r\nfine a thing it is to serve, and so it seems fitting to have on the\r\ncover at your reader a picture of Hiawatha, who\r\n\r\n"Lived and toiled, so I suffered, That the tribes of men might\r\nprosper, That he might advance his people!"\r\n\r\nMake a list of the stories you have read in this book that tell about\r\nservice. Read the lines in "The White-man\'s foot" that describe "the\r\ngreat canoe with pinions," which you see in the picture on the outside\r\ncover of this book.

Thus, we usually do not\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nWe are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance\r\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\r\nPlease be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,\r\neven years after the official publication date.\r\n\r\nPlease note neither this listing nor its contents are final til\r\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\r\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at\r\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\r\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\r\nand editing by those who wish to do so.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web sites at:\r\nhttp://gutenberg.net or\r\nhttp://promo.net/pg\r\n\r\nThese Web sites include award-winning information about Project\r\nGutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new\r\neBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).\r\n\r\n\r\nThose of you who want to download any eBook before announcement\r\ncan get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is\r\nalso a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the\r\nindexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an\r\nannouncement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or\r\nftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03\r\n\r\nOr /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90\r\n\r\nJust search by the first five letters of the filename you want,\r\nas it appears in our Newsletters.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\r\n\r\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\r\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\r\nto get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\r\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our\r\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value\r\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\r\nmillion dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text\r\nfiles per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+\r\nWe are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002\r\nIf they reach just 1-2% of the world\'s population then the total\r\nwill reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year\'s end.\r\n\r\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!\r\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\r\nwhich is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.\r\n\r\nHere is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):\r\n\r\neBooks Year Month\r\n\r\n    1  1971 July\r\n   10  1991 January\r\n  100  1994 January\r\n 1000  1997 August\r\n 1500  1998 October\r\n 2000  1999 December\r\n 2500  2000 December\r\n 3000  2001 November\r\n 4000  2001 October/November\r\n 6000  2002 December*\r\n 9000  2003 November*\r\n10000  2004 January*\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created\r\nto secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.\r\n\r\nWe need your donations more than ever!\r\n\r\nAs of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people\r\nand organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,\r\nDelaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,\r\nMichigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New\r\nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,\r\nOklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South\r\nDakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West\r\nVirginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\r\n\r\nWe have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones\r\nthat have responded.\r\n\r\nAs the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list\r\nwill be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.\r\nPlease feel free to ask to check the status of your state.\r\n\r\nIn answer to various questions we have received on this:\r\n\r\nWe are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally\r\nrequest donations in all 50 states.
