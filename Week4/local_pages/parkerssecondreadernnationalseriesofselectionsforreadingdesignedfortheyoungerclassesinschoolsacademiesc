Words are but sounds, by which ideas should be conveyed; and\r\nwritten language is of little use, if it convey but sound alone. Great\r\npains have therefore been taken to exclude from this volume what the\r\nyoung scholar cannot understand, while, at the same time, it has been\r\nthe aim of the author to avoid a puerile style, by which the early\r\nintellect is kept down, and its exertions are repressed. In every step\r\nand stage of its progress, the maxim "_Excelsior_" should be the aim of\r\nthe youthful mind; and the hand of the teacher should be extended, not\r\nto _lift it up_, but only to _assist it in its endeavors to raise\r\nitself_. All of the labor must not be done by the teacher, nor by books.\r\n_They_ are of use only in exciting the mind to act for itself. They may,\r\nindeed, act as pioneers, but the pupil must not be _carried_ in their\r\narms; he must perform the march himself. And herein lies the great\r\ndifficulty of the teacher\'s task: on the one hand, to avoid the evil of\r\nleaving too little to be done by the scholar; and, on the other, to be\r\ncareful that he be not required to do too much. Real difficulties should\r\nbe lightened, but some labor should be permitted to remain. To make such\r\nlabor attractive, and easily endured without discouragement, is the task\r\nwhich best shows the tact and skill of the teacher. If this volume be\r\nfound useful in aiding the teacher, by doing all that should be required\r\n_from the book_, the design of the author will be accomplished.\r\n\r\n                                             R.G.P.\r\n\r\n    _Kneeland Place_, }\r\n    _May, 1851._      }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The Poetical Extracts are designated by Italic Letters_]\r\n\r\nLesson                                                           Page\r\n Preface                                                            v\r\n 1.

I present to you, my little friend, a new book, to assist you in\r\nlearning to read. I do not intend that it shall be a book full of hard\r\nwords, which you do not understand.\r\n\r\n2. I do not think it proper to require children to read what they cannot\r\nunderstand. I shall, therefore, show you how you may understand what is\r\nin this book, and how you may be able, with very little assistance from\r\nyour teacher, to read all the hard words, not only in this book, but\r\nalso in any book which you may hereafter take up.\r\n\r\n3. But first let me repeat to you a saying, which, when I was a little\r\nboy, and went to school, my teacher used to repeat to me. He said that\r\nany one might lead a horse to the water, but no one could make him\r\ndrink. The horse must do that himself. He must open his own mouth, and\r\ndraw in the water, and swallow it, himself.\r\n\r\n4. And so it is with anything which I wish to teach you. I can tell you\r\nmany things which it will be useful for you to know, but I cannot open\r\nyour ears and make you hear me. I cannot turn your eyes so that they\r\nwill look at me when I am talking to you, that you may listen to me.\r\nThat, you must do yourself; and if you do not do it, nothing that I can\r\nsay to you, or do for you, will do you any good.\r\n\r\n5. Many little boys and girls, when their teacher is talking to them,\r\nare in the habit of staring about the school-room, or looking at their\r\nfellow-pupils, or, perhaps, slyly talking to them or laughing with them,\r\nwhen they ought to be listening to what their teacher is saying.\r\n\r\n6. Others, perhaps, may appear to be looking at their teacher, while, at\r\nthe same time, they are thinking about tops and marbles, or kites and\r\ndolls, and other play-things, and have no more idea of what their\r\nteacher is saying to them than if he were not in the room.\r\n\r\n7. Now, here is a little picture, from which I wish to teach you a very\r\nimportant lesson. The picture represents a nest, with four little birds\r\nin it. The mother bird has just been out to get some food for them. The\r\nlittle birds, as soon as their mother returns, begin to open their\r\nmouths wide, and the mother drops some food from her bill into the mouth\r\nof each one; and in this manner they are all fed, until they are old\r\nenough to go abroad and find food for themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n8. Now, what would these little birds do, if, when their mother brings\r\nthem their food, they should keep their mouths all shut, or, perhaps, be\r\nfeeling of one another with their little bills, or crowding each other\r\nout of the nest?\r\n\r\n9. You know that they would have to go without their food; for their\r\nmother would not open their mouths for them, nor could she swallow\r\ntheir food for them. They must do that for themselves, or they must\r\nstarve.\r\n\r\n10. Now, in the same manner that little birds open their mouths to\r\nreceive the food which their mother brings to them, little boys and\r\ngirls should have their ears open to hear what their teachers say to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n11. The little birds, as you see in the picture, have very large mouths,\r\nand they keep them wide open to receive all the food that their mother\r\ndrops; so that none of their food ever falls into the nest, but all goes\r\ninto their mouths, and they swallow it, and it nourishes them, and makes\r\nthem grow.\r\n\r\n12. So, also, little boys and girls should try to catch, in their ears,\r\neverything that their teacher says to them, and keep it in their minds,\r\nand be able to recollect it, by often thinking about it; and thus they\r\nwill grow wise and learned, and be able to teach other little boys and\r\ngirls, of their own, when they themselves grow up.\r\n\r\n13. Now, my little friend, please to open your eyes and see what I have\r\nput into this book for you, and open your ears to hear what your kind\r\nteacher has to say to you, that your minds may grow, and that you may\r\nbecome wise and good children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I told you, in the last lesson, that I would teach you how to\r\nunderstand what is in this book, and how to read the hard words that you\r\nmay find in this or in any other book.\r\n\r\n2. Now, before you can understand them, you must be able to read them;\r\nand in order that you may understand how to read them, you must take the\r\nwords to pieces; that is, take a few of the letters at a time, and see\r\nwhether you can read a part of the word first, and then another part,\r\nuntil you have read the whole of it in parts, and then you can put the\r\nparts together, and thus read the whole word.\r\n\r\n3. Now, in order that you may understand what I mean, I will explain it\r\nto you by taking a long word to pieces, and letting you read a part of\r\nit at a time, until you have learned how to read the whole word.\r\n\r\n4. In the next line, you may read the parts of the word all separated:\r\n\r\n    Ab      ra      ca      dab     ra.\r\n\r\nNow you have read the parts of the word ab-ra-ca-dab-ra all separated,\r\nyou can read them very easily together, so as to make one word, and the\r\nword will be Abracadabra.\r\n\r\n5. This long and hard word was the name of a false god, that was\r\nworshiped many hundreds of years ago, by a people who did not know the\r\ntrue God, whom we worship; and they very foolishly supposed that by\r\nwearing this name, written on paper, in a certain manner, it would cure\r\nthem of many diseases.\r\n\r\n6. Here are a few more long and hard words, divided in the same manner,\r\nwhich you may first read by syllables, that is, one syllable at a time:\r\n\r\nVal  e     tu    di    na\xc2\xb4    ri    an.\r\nIn   de    fat   i     ga     bil\xc2\xb4  i    ty.\r\nHy   po    chon  dri\xc2\xb4  a      cal.\r\nMe   temp  sy    cho\xc2\xb4  sis.\r\nHal  lu    ci    na\xc2\xb4   tion.\r\nZo   o     no\xc2\xb4   mi    a.\r\nSes  qui   pe    dal\xc2\xb4  i      ty.\r\n\r\n7. You may now read these long words as they are here presented, without\r\na division of the syllables, as follows: valetudinarian,\r\nindefatigability, hypochondriacal, metempsychosis, hallucination,\r\nzoonomia, sesquipedality.\r\n\r\n8. Now, you see that words which look hard, and which you find difficult\r\nto read, can be easily read, if you take the pains to divide them into\r\nparts or syllables, and not try to read the whole word at once.\r\n\r\n9. I now propose to relate to you a little story which I read when I was\r\na little boy, and which I think will make you remember what I have just\r\ntold you about reading hard words, by first taking them to pieces, and\r\nreading a part of them at a time.\r\n\r\n10. A father, who was dying, called his seven sons around his bed, and\r\nshowed them a bundle of small sticks tied together, and asked each one\r\nto try to break all the sticks at once, without untying the bundle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n11. Each of the sons took the bundle of sticks, and putting it across\r\nhis knee, tried with all his strength to break it; but not one of them\r\ncould break the sticks, or even bend them, while they were tied\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n12. The father then directed his oldest son to untie the bundle, and to\r\nbreak each stick separately. As soon as the bundle was untied, each of\r\nthe sons took the sticks separately, and found that they could easily\r\nbreak every one of them, and scatter them, in small pieces, all about\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n13. "Now," said the father, "I wish you, my dear sons, to learn a lesson\r\nfrom these sticks. So long as you are all united in love and friendship,\r\nyou need fear little from any enemies; but, if you quarrel among\r\nyourselves, and do not keep together, you see by these little sticks how\r\neasily your enemies may put you down separately."\r\n\r\n14. Now, this was a very wise father, and he taught his sons a very\r\nuseful lesson with this bundle of sticks. I also wish to teach you, my\r\nlittle friend, whoever you are, that are reading this book, another\r\nuseful lesson from the same story.\r\n\r\n15. Hard words, especially long ones, will be difficult to you to read,\r\nunless, like the sons in the story, you untie the bundle; that is, until\r\nyou take the long words apart, and read one part or syllable at a time.\r\nThus you may learn what is meant by that wise saying, "_Divide and\r\nconquer_."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON III.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I have another lesson to teach you from the same story of the old man\r\nand the bundle of sticks, which I think will be very useful to you, and\r\nwill make your lessons very much easier to you.\r\n\r\n2. Whenever you have a lesson to learn, do not look at it all at once,\r\nand say, I cannot learn this long lesson; but divide it into small\r\nparts, and say to yourself, I will try to learn this first little part,\r\nand after I have learned that, I will rest two or three minutes, and\r\nthen I will learn another little part, and then rest again a few\r\nminutes, and then I will learn another.\r\n\r\n3. I think that in this way you will find study is not so hard a thing\r\nas it seemed to you at first, and you will have another explanation of\r\nthat wise saying, _Divide and conquer_.\r\n\r\n4. I will now tell you another story that I read when I was a little\r\nboy. It was called a fable. But before I tell you the story, I must\r\ntell you what a fable is.\r\n\r\n5. A fable is a story which is not true. But, although it is not a true\r\nstory, it is a very useful one, because it always teaches us a good\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\n6. In many fables, birds and beasts are represented as speaking. Now,\r\nyou know that birds and beasts cannot talk, and therefore the story, or\r\nfable, which tells us that birds and beasts, and other things, that are\r\nnot alive, do talk, cannot be true.\r\n\r\n7. But I have told you, that although fables are not true stories, they\r\nare very useful to us, because they teach us a useful lesson. This\r\nlesson that they teach is called the _moral_ of the fable; and that is\r\nalways the best fable that has the best moral to it, or, in other words,\r\nthat teaches us the best lesson.\r\n\r\n8. The story, or the fable, that I promised to tell you, is in the next\r\nlesson, and I wish you, when you read it, to see whether you can find\r\nout what the lesson, or moral, is which it teaches; and whether it is at\r\nall like the story of the father and the bundle of sticks, that I told\r\nyou in the last lesson. While you read it, be very careful that you do\r\nnot pass over any word the meaning of which you do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON IV.\r\n\r\n_The Discontented Pendulum._--JANE TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. An old clock, that had stood for fifty years in a farmer\'s kitchen,\r\nwithout giving its owner any cause of complaint, early one summer\'s\r\nmorning, before the family was stirring, suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\n2. Upon this, the dial-plate (if we may credit the fable) changed\r\ncountenance with alarm; the hands made a vain effort to continue their\r\ncourse; the wheels remained motionless with surprise; the weights hung\r\nspeechless;--each member felt disposed to lay the blame on the others.\r\n\r\n3. At length the dial instituted a formal inquiry as to the cause of\r\nthe stagnation, when hands, wheels, weights, with one voice, protested\r\ntheir innocence.\r\n\r\n4. But now a faint tick was heard below from the pendulum, who thus\r\nspoke:--"I confess myself to be the sole cause of the present stoppage;\r\nand I am willing, for the general satisfaction, to assign my reasons.\r\nThe truth is, that I am tired of ticking."\r\n\r\n5. Upon hearing this, the old clock became so enraged, that it was on\r\nthe very point of _striking_. "Lazy wire!" exclaimed the dial-plate,\r\nholding up its hands.\r\n\r\n6. "Very good!" replied the pendulum; "it is vastly easy for you,\r\nMistress Dial, who have always, as everybody knows, set yourself up\r\nabove me,--it is vastly easy for you, I say, to accuse other people of\r\nlaziness! You, who have had nothing to do, all the days of your life,\r\nbut to stare people in the face, and to amuse yourself with watching all\r\nthat goes on in the kitchen!\r\n\r\n7. "Think, I beseech you, how you would like to be shut up for life in\r\nthis dark closet, and to wag backwards and forwards, year after year, as\r\nI do."\r\n\r\n8. "As to that," said the dial, "is there not a window in your house, on\r\npurpose for you to look through?"--"For all that," resumed the\r\npendulum, "it is very dark here; and although there is a window, I dare\r\nnot stop, even for an instant, to look out at it.\r\n\r\n9. "Besides, I am really tired of my way of life; and, if you wish, I\'ll\r\ntell you how I took this disgust at my employment. I happened this\r\nmorning to be calculating how many times I should have to tick in the\r\ncourse of only the next twenty-four hours; perhaps some of you, above\r\nthere, can give me the exact sum."\r\n\r\n10. The minute-hand, being _quick_ at figures, presently replied,\r\n"Eighty-six thousand four hundred times."\r\n\r\n11. "Exactly so," replied the pendulum; "well, I appeal to you all, if\r\nthe very thought of this was not enough to fatigue one; and when I began\r\nto multiply the strokes of one day by those of months and years, really,\r\nit is no wonder if I felt discouraged at the prospect: so, after a great\r\ndeal of reasoning and hesitation, thinks I to myself, I\'ll stop."\r\n\r\n12. The dial could scarcely keep its countenance during this harangue;\r\nbut, resuming its gravity, thus replied: "Dear Mr. Pendulum, I am really\r\nastonished that such a useful, industrious person as yourself, should\r\nhave been overcome by this sudden action.\r\n\r\n13. "It is true, you have done a great deal of work in your time; so\r\nhave we all, and are likely to do; which, although it may fatigue us to\r\n_think_ of, the question is, whether it will fatigue us to _do_. Would\r\nyou now do me the favor to give about half a dozen strokes, to\r\nillustrate my argument?"\r\n\r\n14. The pendulum complied, and ticked six times in its usual pace.\r\n"Now," resumed the dial, "may I be allowed to inquire if that exertion\r\nwas at all fatiguing or disagreeable to you?"\r\n\r\n15. "Not in the least," replied the pendulum; "it is not of six strokes\r\nthat I complain, nor of sixty, but of _millions_."\r\n\r\n16. "Very good," replied the dial; "but recollect, that though you may\r\n_think_ of a million strokes in an instant, you are required to\r\n_execute_ but one; and that, however often you may hereafter have to\r\nswing, a moment will always be given you to swing in."\r\n\r\n17. "That consideration staggers me, I confess," said the\r\npendulum.--"Then I hope," resumed the dial-plate, "we shall all\r\nimmediately return to our duty; for the maids will lie in bed, if we\r\nstand idling thus."\r\n\r\n18. Upon this, the weights, who had never been accused of _light_\r\nconduct, used all their influence in urging him to proceed; when, as\r\nwith one consent, the wheels began to turn, the hands began to move, the\r\npendulum began to swing, and, to its credit, ticked as loud as ever;\r\nwhile a red beam of the rising sun, that streamed through a hole in the\r\nkitchen window, shining full upon the dial-plate, it brightened up, as\r\nif nothing had been the matter.\r\n\r\n19. When the farmer came down to breakfast that morning, upon looking at\r\nthe clock, he declared that his watch had gained half an hour in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON V.\r\n\r\n_Address of the Author to the Pupil,--continued from Lesson 3d._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The fable of the old clock, which has just been read, is intended to\r\nteach us a lesson, or moral, and that is, that whenever we have anything\r\nto do, whether it be a long lesson or a piece of hard work, we must not\r\nthink of it all at once, but divide the labor, and thus conquer the\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n2. The pendulum was discouraged when it thought that it had to tick\r\neighty-six thousand four hundred times in twenty-four hours; but when\r\nthe dial asked it to tick half a dozen times only, the pendulum\r\nconfessed that it was not fatiguing or disagreeable to do so.\r\n\r\n3. It was only by thinking what a large number of times it had to tick\r\nin twenty-four hours, that it became fatigued.\r\n\r\n4. Now, suppose that a little boy, or a little girl, has a hard lesson\r\nto learn, and, instead of sitting down quietly and trying to learn a\r\nlittle of it at a time, and after that a little more, until it is all\r\nlearned, should begin to cry, and say I cannot learn all of this lesson,\r\nit is too long, or too hard, and I never can get it, that little boy, or\r\ngirl, would act just as the pendulum did when it complained of the hard\r\nwork it had to do.\r\n\r\n5. But the teacher says to the little boy, Come, my dear, read over the\r\nfirst sentence of your lesson to me six times. The little boy reads the\r\nfirst sentence six times, and confesses to his teacher that it was not\r\nvery hard work to do so.\r\n\r\n6. The teacher then asks him to read it over six times more; and the\r\nlittle boy finds that, before he has read it to his teacher so often as\r\nthe six times more, he can say it without his book before him.\r\n\r\n7. In this way, that little boy will find, that it is not, after all,\r\nso hard work to get what he calls a hard lesson; because all that he has\r\nto do, is to read a small portion of the lesson at a time, and to repeat\r\nthe reading of that small portion until he can repeat it without the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n8. When he has done this, he can take another small portion of the\r\nlesson, and do the same with that, until, by degrees, he has learnt the\r\nwhole lesson; and then he will feel happy, because he knows that his\r\nteacher, and his parents, will be pleased with him.\r\n\r\n9. But some pupils say to themselves, when they have a lesson to learn,\r\nI do not want to study this lesson now; I will study it by and by, or\r\nto-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n10. But, by and by, and when to-morrow comes, they feel no more disposed\r\nto study their lesson than they did when the lesson was first given to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n11. Now, my little friend, if you wish your time at school to pass\r\npleasantly, do not say to yourself, I will get my lesson by and by, or\r\nto-morrow, but set yourself about it immediately, learn it as quickly as\r\nyou can, and I will assure you will not only make your teachers and your\r\nparents happier, but you will be much happier yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VI.\r\n\r\n_The Author to the Pupil._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In the first lesson, I told you that I would show you how to\r\nunderstand what is in this book; and how you may, with very little\r\nassistance from your teacher, be able to read all the hard words that\r\nyou find in any book.\r\n\r\n2. Many little boys and girls are very fond of running out of their\r\nplaces in school, and going up to their teachers with a great many\r\nunnecessary questions. This always troubles the teacher, and prevents\r\nhis going through with all his business in time to dismiss you at the\r\nusual hour.\r\n\r\n3. Whenever you meet with any real difficulty, that you cannot overcome\r\nyourself without his assistance, you should watch for an opportunity\r\nwhen he is at leisure, and endeavor to attract his attention quietly,\r\nand without noise and bustle, so that your fellow-pupils may not be\r\ndisturbed, and then respectfully and modestly ask him to assist you.\r\n\r\n4. But if you are noisy and troublesome, and run up to him frequently\r\nwith questions that, with a little thought, you could easily answer\r\nyourself, he will not be pleased with you, but will think that you wish\r\nto make trouble; and, perhaps, will appear unkind to you.\r\n\r\n5. I will now endeavor to show you how you may understand what is in\r\nyour book, so that you will have no need to be troublesome to your\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\n6. In the first place, then, always endeavor to understand every line\r\nthat you read; try to find out what it means, and, if there is any word\r\nthat you have never seen or heard of before, look out the word in a\r\ndictionary, and see what the meaning of the word is; and then read the\r\nline over again, and see whether you can tell what the whole line means,\r\nwhen you have found out the meaning of the strange word.\r\n\r\n7. Now, as you can understand everything best when you have an example,\r\nI will give you one, as follows. In the tenth chapter of the Acts of the\r\nApostles, at the first verse, there are these words:\r\n\r\n     1. "There was a certain man in Cesarea, called\r\n     Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian\r\n     band,\r\n\r\n     2. "A devout man, and one that feared God with all his\r\n     house, and gave much alms to the people, and prayed to\r\n     God always."\r\n\r\n8. I suppose you know what most of the words in these verses mean,\r\nexcept the word _centurion_ in the first verse, and the word _alms_ in\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\n9. Now, if you look for the word _centurion_ in the dictionary, it will\r\ntell you that _centurion_ means a military officer, who commanded a\r\nhundred men. Thus you find that Cornelius was a soldier; and not only\r\nthat he was a soldier, but that he was an officer, that commanded\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n10. Again, if you look for the word _alms_ in your dictionary, you will\r\nfind that it means money given to the poor; and thus you find that\r\nCornelius was a very good man, and not only prayed to God, but also gave\r\nmuch money to assist the poor.\r\n\r\n11. You see, then, how useful a book a dictionary is at school, and how\r\nimportant it is that you should have one. If your parents cannot give\r\nyou a very good one, any one is better than none.\r\n\r\n12. But if you have no dictionary, or if you cannot find the word you\r\nwish to find in the dictionary, you must then wait for a convenient time\r\nto ask your teacher, and he will always be pleased to find that you are\r\ntrying to understand the words in your lesson.\r\n\r\n13. If you have a dictionary, and do not know how to find out the words\r\nin it, ask your teacher to show you; and when he has showed you how to\r\nuse it, be sure never to pass over a single word without knowing what it\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VII.\r\n\r\n_How to find out the Meaning of Words._--ORIGINAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. Many years ago, when I lived in a small town, near the Merrimac\r\nriver, a little Spanish girl came to board in the same house.\r\n\r\n2. She could speak very well in her own language; but the people in her\r\ncountry speak a language very different from ours: and when she first\r\nbegan to speak, she heard nothing but Spanish words; and she learned no\r\nother.\r\n\r\n3. She could not speak a word of English, and did not understand a word\r\nthat was spoken to her by any of the family.\r\n\r\n4. Her parents were very rich, but they placed her in the family, that\r\nshe might learn to speak English.\r\n\r\n5. She had no dictionary to turn to, to look out the meaning of words;\r\nand if she was hungry, she could not ask for bread, and if she was\r\nthirsty, she could not ask for water, nor milk, nor tea, for she did not\r\nknow the meaning of either of the words, _water_, _tea_, nor _milk_.\r\n\r\n6. Perhaps you would be puzzled to tell how she could learn to speak\r\nEnglish, if she had no one to teach her, and had no dictionary to inform\r\nher about the words.\r\n\r\n7. But it was not many days before she could say "_bread_," if she was\r\nhungry, and "_water_," if she wanted to drink; and I was very much\r\nsurprised to find how soon it was, at the dinner-table, she could ask\r\nfor meat, or potato, or pudding; and, at tea-time, for tea, or milk, or\r\nsugar, or butter, or bread.\r\n\r\n8. I have no doubt that you would like to know how this little Spanish\r\ngirl learned to speak all of these words. I do not intend to tell you\r\nquite yet, but I think you will find out yourself, if you will read the\r\nnext lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VIII.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. About twenty years ago, I was very ill, and, for a long time, my\r\nfriends thought I never should recover.\r\n\r\n2. By the very attentive care of my physician, and by the devoted\r\nattention of my wife, I unexpectedly grew better; and the doctor said\r\nthat I must take a voyage for the recovery of my health.\r\n\r\n3. A kind friend, who was going to the West Indies, in a vessel of his\r\nown, very generously offered to take me with him, and I gratefully\r\naccepted the offer.\r\n\r\n4. We sailed from Boston early one morning, and were soon out of sight\r\nof the land. I was quite ill during the voyage; but fortunately the\r\nvoyage was a short one, and we reached the place of our destination on\r\nthe fourteenth day after we sailed.\r\n\r\n5. The island, where we landed, was a beautiful spot; and lemons,\r\noranges, pine-apples, and many other delicious fruits, were growing out\r\nin the open air.\r\n\r\n6. The people who lived on this island did not speak the English\r\nlanguage; and the family with whom I was to reside could speak only in\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\n7. I observed, at dinner-time, that some of the persons at the table\r\nheld out their tumblers to the servant, and said something which sounded\r\nto me like _O_.\r\n\r\n8. I often heard this word; and every time it was spoken, _water_ was\r\nbrought, or poured out, or something was done with _water_.\r\n\r\n9. I then made up my mind that this word that I thought was O meant\r\nwater; and I found out afterwards that I was right, except that I did\r\nnot spell it right.\r\n\r\n10. This I discovered by means of the Bible, from which the family used\r\nto read.\r\n\r\n11. It was a very large one, with very large letters; and as I was very\r\nfond of hearing them read, and of looking over the book while some one\r\nwas reading aloud, I noticed that whenever the reader came to the\r\nletters e, a, u, he called them O; and thus I found out that water, in\r\ntheir language, was called O, but was spelt e, a, u.\r\n\r\n12. In the same manner, I found out the words, or names, which they gave\r\nto bread, and sugar, and butter, and meat, and figs, and oranges, and\r\nlemons, and pine-apples.\r\n\r\n13. And now, perhaps, you may be able to find out how the little Spanish\r\ngirl, mentioned in the last lesson, learned the meaning of English words\r\nthat she had never heard until she came to live in the family where\r\nnothing but English was spoken.\r\n\r\n14. She was obliged to listen, when any one spoke, and watch to see what\r\nwas wanted; and in the same manner in which I found out the meaning of\r\nO, and what to call bread, and sugar, and butter, and meat, and figs,\r\nand oranges, and other fruits, she learned to call things by their\r\nEnglish names.\r\n\r\n15. But, in order to do this, she was obliged to listen very\r\nattentively, to try to remember every new name that she learned; and, by\r\nso doing, in less than a year she could talk almost as plainly as any\r\none in the house.\r\n\r\n16. It was very easy for her to learn the names of things, because she\r\nheard them spoken very often. Such words as _chair_, _table_, _water_,\r\n_sugar_, _cake_, _potato_, _pudding_, and other words which are the\r\nnames of things she could see, she learned very quickly.\r\n\r\n17. But such words as _come_ and _go_, or _run_ and _walk_, and the\r\nlittle words _to_ and _from_, and _over_ and _under_, or such words as\r\n_quickly_ and _slowly_, and many other words of the same kind, she could\r\nnot learn so easily.\r\n\r\n18. In the next lesson perhaps you will find out how she learned the\r\nmeaning of these words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON IX.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. There was a small family living very near to your residence, my young\r\nfriends who are reading this lesson, consisting of the father, the\r\nmother, and four young children.\r\n\r\n2. The oldest was a boy of twelve years old, the next was a little girl\r\nof about eight, the third was another pretty little girl of six, and the\r\nyoungest was an infant boy, only nine months old.\r\n\r\n3. As you may well suppose, the baby, as he was called, was the delight,\r\nnot only of the father and the mother, but also of his elder brother and\r\nhis two sisters.\r\n\r\n4. The oldest brother had a dog whose name was Guido,--an Italian name,\r\nwhich is pronounced as if it were spelt Gwe\xc2\xb4do.\r\n\r\n5. The dog had learned to love the dear little baby as much as the rest\r\nof the family; and very often, when he was lying on the floor, the baby\r\nwould pull his tail, or his ears, or put his little hand into the\r\ncreature\'s mouth, and Guido would play as gently with him as if he knew\r\nthat the baby was a very tender little thing, and could not bear any\r\nrough treatment.\r\n\r\n6. Nothing pleased the whole family, and Guido among the rest, so much,\r\nas to hear the baby try to say _papa_, and _mamma_, and _bub_, and\r\n_sis_; for he could not say _brother_, nor _sister_, nor pronounce any\r\nother words plainly.\r\n\r\n7. The youngest sister was very fond of making him say these words; and\r\nevery time the little creature repeated them to her, she would throw her\r\narms around his little neck, and hug and kiss him with all the\r\naffectionate love her little heart could express.\r\n\r\n8. She often used to dress her little doll as prettily as she knew how;\r\ntying its frock on one day with a pretty blue ribbon, and on another\r\nwith a red one; for she had noticed, that whenever the doll was newly\r\ndressed, the dear little baby would look very steadily at it, and hold\r\nout its little arms towards it; and then she would carry it to her\r\nlittle brother, and say to him, "Dolly,--pretty dolly,--bub want to see\r\ndolly?"\r\n\r\n9. One day she had dressed her doll in a very bright new dress, with\r\nvery gay ribbons, and was carrying it towards her father to show it to\r\nhim, when suddenly she heard the baby cry out, "Dolly!"\r\n\r\n10. She immediately ran with delight to her little brother, holding up\r\nthe doll in its new shining dress, and repeated her usual words,\r\n"Dolly,--bub want dolly?"\r\n\r\n11. The baby, delighted, looked up in its mother\'s face, and laughed,\r\nand crowed, and giggled, and in its delight again repeated the word\r\n"Dolly!"\r\n\r\n12. Pleased with her success, the little sister was unwearied in her\r\nefforts to make her little brother repeat other words; and day by day\r\nshe was gratified to find the list of words which he lisped was growing\r\nin length.\r\n\r\n13. By the unwearied endeavors of father, mother, brother and sisters,\r\nthis pretty little baby, by the time that it was three years old, could\r\nspeak plainly anything that was repeated to him, and had learned the\r\nnames of almost everything that he saw about the house, the yard, and\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n14. But it was observed that Guido, the dog, although he could not speak\r\na word, had also learned the names of many things; and when George, the\r\noldest son, told him to go and bring his ball to him, Guido would wag\r\nhis tail, and go up into George\'s chamber, and look about the room until\r\nhe had found the ball; and then he would run down the stairs, and\r\ndropping the ball at his young master\'s feet, look up in his face,\r\nexpecting that George would throw it down for him to catch again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n15. The baby, however, learnt words and names much faster than Guido;\r\nfor although Guido knew as much as any dog knows, yet dogs are different\r\ncreatures from children, and cannot learn so much nor so fast as\r\nchildren can, because it has not pleased God to give them the same\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n16. Now, perhaps you may wish to know who this interesting family were\r\nof whom I have been speaking; and you will probably be surprised to\r\nlearn, that all I have told you about this little baby is true of every\r\nlittle baby, and that the manner that every infant is taught to speak is\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n17. It is the same manner as that in which the little Spanish girl,\r\nmentioned in the seventh lesson, was taught to speak the English\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON X.\r\n\r\n_Words._--ORIGINAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I told you, in the last lesson, how an infant child first learned to\r\nspeak, when it was taught by its father and mother, and brother and\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\n2. I intend to show you, in this lesson, how the little child learned\r\nthe meaning of a great many words himself, without the assistance of any\r\none else.\r\n\r\n3. He was very fond of Guido, the dog, and watched everything he did,\r\nespecially when his brother George was playing with him.\r\n\r\n4. When George called Guido, and said to the dog, "_Come here_, Guido,"\r\nthe little boy could not help noticing that Guido _went to_ George.\r\n\r\n5. When George\'s father or mother called George, and said, "Come here,\r\nGeorge," the little child saw that George _went to_ his father, or his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n6. Now, nobody told the little child what George, or his father, or his\r\nmother, meant by the word _come_; but he always saw, that when any one\r\nsaid to another, "_Come_," that the one who was spoken to always _moved\r\ntowards_ the person who called him, and in this way the little child\r\nfound out what his father or his mother meant by the word _come_.\r\n\r\n7. It was in this way, my young friend who are reading this lesson, that\r\nyou, yourself, learned the meaning of most of the words that you know.\r\n\r\n8. When you were a little child, like the infant of whom I have been\r\nspeaking, you knew no more about words, or about speaking, than he did.\r\n\r\n9. But, by hearing others speak and use words, you learned to use them\r\nyourself; and there is no word ever used, either in books or anywhere\r\nelse, that you cannot find out its meaning, provided that you hear it\r\nused frequently, and by different persons.\r\n\r\n10. I will now give you an example, to show you what I mean. I will give\r\nyou a word that you probably never heard of before; and although I shall\r\nnot tell you what the word means, I think you will find it out yourself,\r\nbefore you have read many more lines of this lesson.\r\n\r\n11. The word _hippoi_ is the word that I shall choose, because I know\r\nthat you do not know the meaning of it; but I wish you to read the\r\nfollowing sentences in which the word is used, and I think that you will\r\nfind out what _hippoi_ means, before you have read them all.\r\n\r\n12. In California, and in Mexico, and in most parts of South America,\r\nthere are many wild _hippoi_, which feed on the grass that grows wild\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n13. The Indians hunt the _hippoi_; and when they catch them, they tame\r\nthem, and put bridles on their heads, and bits in their mouths, and\r\nsaddles on their backs, and ride on them.\r\n\r\n14. A carriage, with four white _hippoi_, has just passed by the window,\r\nand one of the _hippoi_ has dropped his shoe. The coachman must take him\r\nto the blacksmith, to have the shoe put on.\r\n\r\n15. The noise which _hippoi_ make is a very strange noise, and when\r\nthey make it they are said to neigh (_pronounced na_).\r\n\r\n16. The hoofs of cows and goats and sheep and deer are cloven; that is,\r\nthey are split into two parts; but the hoofs of _hippoi_ are not split\r\nor cloven, and for that reason they are called whole-hoofed animals.\r\n\r\n17. My father has in his barn four _hippoi_. One of them is red, and has\r\na short tail; another is white, with a few dark hairs in his mane, or\r\nlong hair on the top of his neck; the third is gray, with dark spots on\r\nhis body; and the fourth is perfectly black, and has a very long tail,\r\nwhich reaches almost to the ground.\r\n\r\n18. Now, from these sentences, I think you will see that _hippoi_ does\r\nnot mean cows, or goats, or sheep, or deer; and I do not think it\r\nnecessary to tell you anything more about it, except that it is a word\r\nthat was spoken by the Corinthians and the Colossians and the Ephesians,\r\nthe people to whom St. Paul addressed those epistles or letters in the\r\nBible called by their names.\r\n\r\n19. When you have read this lesson, your teacher will probably ask you\r\nwhat the word _hippoi_ means; and I hope you will be able to tell him\r\nthat _hippoi_ means----[here put in the English word for _hippoi_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XI.\r\n\r\n_Definitions._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In the last lesson, I gave you a word which you had not seen before,\r\nto find out the meaning of it, without looking in a dictionary.\r\n\r\n2. I told you, in a former lesson, how the little Spanish girl found out\r\nthe meaning of words which she did not know; and afterwards informed you\r\nhow the infant child was taught to speak.\r\n\r\n3. Now, I doubt not that you can speak a great many words, and know what\r\nthey mean when you use them; but I do not think that you ever thought\r\nmuch about the way in which you learned them.\r\n\r\n4. Perhaps you will be surprised to hear that everybody learns to talk\r\nand to use words in the same way that the little Spanish girl and the\r\nlittle infant learned them; that is, by hearing others use them in\r\ndifferent ways, just as the word _hippoi_ was used in the last lesson.\r\n\r\n5. Nobody ever told you, probably, the meaning of a great many words\r\nthat you know; and yet you know them full as well, and perhaps better,\r\nthan if any one had told you about them.\r\n\r\n6. Perhaps you have a brother whose name is John, or George, or James,\r\nor a sister whose name is Mary, or Jane, or Ann, or Lucy. You have\r\nalways heard them called by these names, ever since you, or they, were\r\nquite young; and have noticed that when John was called, that the one\r\nwhose name is John would answer; and as each one answered when spoken\r\nto, you learnt which was John, and which was Mary, and which was Lucy.\r\n\r\n7. So also, when a certain animal, having two large horns and a long\r\ntail, and which is milked every night and morning, passed by, you heard\r\nsome one say _cow_; and in this way you learned what the word _cow_\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n8. So also, when water falls from the sky in drops, little children hear\r\npeople say it rains; and thus they find out what _rain_, means.\r\n\r\n9. Now, when anybody asks you what any word means, although you know it\r\nvery well, yet it is a very hard thing to tell what it means,--that is,\r\nto give a definition of it,--as you will see by the little story I am\r\nabout to tell you.\r\n\r\n10. A teacher, who was very anxious to make his scholars understand\r\ntheir lessons, once told them he had a very hard question he wished to\r\nask them, and that he would let the one who answered the question best\r\ntake the head of the class.\r\n\r\n11. This teacher never allowed any of his pupils to speak to him without\r\nfirst raising his right hand above his head, to signify that the child\r\nhad something to say; and when any child raised his hand in this way, if\r\nhe was not busy, he called upon the child to say what he wished.\r\n\r\n12. In this way he prevented the children from troubling him when he was\r\nbusy; and in this way he also prevented them from interrupting each\r\nother, as would be the case if several of them should speak at once.\r\n\r\n13. On the day of which I am about to speak, he said to them, Now,\r\nchildren, I have a very hard question to ask you, that does not require\r\nyou to study, but only to think about it, in order to answer it well;\r\nand the one who gives me the best answer shall go to the head of the\r\nclass. The question is this: _What is a bird?_\r\n\r\n14. Before they heard the question, they looked very sober, and thought\r\ntheir master intended to puzzle them, or to give them a long sentence to\r\ncommit to memory. But as soon as they heard the question, they began to\r\nsmile among themselves, and wonder how their teacher should call that a\r\nhard question.\r\n\r\n15. A dozen hands were immediately raised, to signify that so many of\r\nthe children were ready to answer it.\r\n\r\n16. Well, John, said the teacher, your hand is up; can you tell me _what\r\na bird is_?\r\n\r\n17. John immediately rose, and standing on the right-hand side of his\r\nseat, said, A bird is a thing that has two legs.\r\n\r\n18. Well, said the teacher, suppose some one should saw off two of the\r\nlegs of my chair; it would then be a thing that has two legs; but it\r\nwould not be a bird, would it? You see, then, that your answer is not\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n19. I will not mention the names of the other children who raised their\r\nhands; but I will tell you what the answers were which some of them made\r\nto the questions, and what the teacher said about each of their answers.\r\n\r\n20. One of the children said that a bird is an _animal_ with two legs.\r\nBut, said the teacher, all little boys and girls, and all men and women,\r\nare animals with two legs; but they are not birds.\r\n\r\n21. Another child said that a bird is an animal that has wings. But the\r\nteacher said there are some fishes that have wings, and that fishes are\r\nnot birds.\r\n\r\n22. A bright little girl then modestly rose and said, A bird is an\r\nanimal that has legs and wings, and that flies. The teacher smiled upon\r\nher very kindly, and told her that it is true that a bird has legs and\r\nwings, and that it flies; but, said he, there is another animal, also,\r\nthat has legs and wings, and that flies very fast in the air. It is\r\ncalled a _bat_. It flies only in the night; but it has no feathers, and\r\ntherefore is not a bird.\r\n\r\n23. Upon hearing this, another bright-eyed child very timidly rose and\r\nsaid, A bird is an animal that has legs, wings and feathers. Very well,\r\nsaid the teacher; but can you not think of anything else that a bird\r\nhas, which other creatures have not?\r\n\r\n24. The children looked at one another, wondering what their teacher\r\ncould mean; and no one could think what to say, until the teacher said\r\nto them, Think a moment, and try to tell me how a bird\'s mouth looks.\r\nLook first at my mouth. You see I have two lips, and these two lips form\r\nmy mouth. Now, tell me whether a bird has two lips; and if he has not,\r\nwhat he has instead of lips.\r\n\r\n25. One of the children immediately arose and said, that a bird has no\r\nlips, but he has a bill; and that bill opens as the lips of a man do,\r\nand forms the mouth of the bird.\r\n\r\n26. Yes, said the teacher; and now listen to me while I tell you the\r\nthings you should always mention, when you are asked what a bird is,--\r\n\r\n    First, A bird is an animal.\r\n    Secondly, It has two legs.\r\n    Thirdly, It has two wings.\r\n    Fourthly, It has feathers.\r\n    Fifthly, It has a hard, glossy bill.\r\n\r\n27. And now, said the teacher, you see that I was right when I told you\r\nthat I had a hard question to ask you, when I asked What is a bird?\r\n\r\n28. Now, if you will join all of these things which belong to a bird in\r\nthe description which you give in answer to my question, What is a bird,\r\nyou will then give a correct definition of a bird,--that is, you will\r\ntell exactly what a bird is, and no more, and no less.\r\n\r\n29. A bird is an animal covered with feathers, having two legs, two\r\nwings, and a hard, glossy bill.\r\n\r\n30. When you are asked what anything is, recollect what I have told you\r\nabout a bird, and try to recall everything that you ever knew about the\r\nthing, and in this way you will be able to give a satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\n31. This will also teach you to think, and that is one of the most\r\nimportant objects for which you go to school. It will enable you also to\r\nunderstand what you read; and you can always read those things best\r\nwhich you understand well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XII.\r\n\r\n_Reading and Spelling._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Another important thing for which you go to school is to learn how to\r\nspell. It is not always very easy to spell, because there are so many\r\ndifferent ways in which the same letters are pronounced in different\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n2. That you may understand what I mean, I shall give an example, to show\r\nyou how many different ways the same letters are pronounced in different\r\nwords; and also another example, to show you how many different ways\r\nthere are of spelling the same syllable.\r\n\r\n3. To show you, first, in how many different ways the same letters are\r\npronounced in different words, I shall take the letters o, u, g, h.\r\n\r\n4. The letters _o, u, g, h_, are sounded or pronounced like the letter\r\n_o_ alone, in the word _though_. The letters _o, u, g, h_, are\r\npronounced like _uf_, in the word _tough_.\r\n\r\n5. In the word _cough_, the letters _o, u, g, h_, are pronounced like\r\n_off_. In the words _slough_ and _plough_, the letters _o, u, g, h_, are\r\npronounced like _ow_; and in the word _through_, they are pronounced\r\nlike _ew_, or like _u_.\r\n\r\n6. In the word _hiccough_ the letters _ough_ are pronounced like\r\n_up_--and in the word _lough_, the letters are pronounced like _lok_.\r\n\r\n7. There are many words which end with a sound like _shun_; and this\r\nsyllable is spelled in many different ways, as you will see in the\r\nfollowing example.\r\n\r\n8. In the words _ocean_, _motion_, _mansion_, _physician_, _halcyon_,\r\n_Parnassian_, _Christian_, and many other such words, the last syllable\r\nis pronounced as if it were spelled _shun_.\r\n\r\n9. You see, then, that in some words a syllable sounding very much like\r\n_shun_ is spelled\r\n\r\n                          _cean_, as in ocean;\r\n    in some it is spelled _tion_, as in nation;\r\n    in some it is spelled _sion_, as in mansion;\r\n    in some it is spelled _cian_, as in physician;\r\n    in some it is spelled _cyon_, as in halcyon;\r\n    in some it is spelled _sian_, as in Parnassian.\r\n\r\n10. It is such things as these which make both reading and spelling very\r\nhard lessons for young children. If they think of them all at once, as\r\nthe pendulum did of the eighty-six thousand times that it had to swing\r\nin twenty-four hours, it is no wonder if they feel discouraged, and say,\r\nI can\'t get these hard lessons.\r\n\r\n11. But you must recollect that, as the pendulum, every time it had to\r\nswing, had a moment given it to swing in, so you also have a moment\r\ngiven you to learn everything in; and if you get a little at a time, you\r\nwill, in the end, finish it all, if it be ever so large.\r\n\r\n12. You have seen the workman engaged in building a brick house. He\r\ntakes one brick at a time, and lays it on the mortar, smoothing the\r\nmortar with his trowel; and then he takes another brick, and another,\r\nuntil he has made a long row for the side of the house.\r\n\r\n13. He then takes another brick, and lays that on the first row; and\r\ncontinues laying brick after brick, until the house gradually rises to\r\nits proper height.\r\n\r\n14. Now, if the workman had said that he could never lay so many bricks,\r\nthe house would never have been built; but he knew that, although he\r\ncould lay but one brick at a time, yet, by continuing to lay them, one\r\nby one, the house would at last be finished.\r\n\r\n15. There are some children, who live as much as a mile, or a half of a\r\nmile, from the school-house. If these children were told that they must\r\nstep forward with first one foot and then the other, and must take three\r\nor four thousand steps, before they could reach the school-house, they\r\nwould probably be very much discouraged, every morning, before they set\r\nout, and would say to their mothers, Mother, I can\'t go to school,--it\r\nis so far; I must put out one foot, and drag the other after it, three\r\nthousand times, before I can get there.\r\n\r\n16. You see, then, that although it may appear to be a very hard thing\r\nto learn to read and to spell so many words as there are in large books,\r\nyet you are required to learn but a few of them at a time; and if there\r\nwere twice as many as there are, you will learn them all, in time.\r\n\r\n17. I shall tell you a story, in the next lesson, to show you how\r\nimportant it is to know how to spell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIII.\r\n\r\n_Importance of Learning to Spell._--ORIGINAL VERSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A rich man, whose education had been neglected in early life, and who\r\nwas, of course, very ignorant of many things which even little boys and\r\ngirls among us now-a-days know very well, lived in a large house, with\r\nvery handsome furniture in it.\r\n\r\n2. He kept a carriage, and many servants, some of whom were very much\r\nbetter educated than he was himself.\r\n\r\n3. This rich man had been invited out many times to dine with his\r\nneighbors; and he observed that at the dinners to which he was invited\r\nthere were turkeys, and ducks, and chickens, as well as partridges, and\r\nquails, and woodcocks, together with salmon, and trout, and\r\npickerel,--with roasted beef, and lamb, and mutton, and pork.\r\n\r\n4. But he noticed that every one seemed to be more fond of chickens than\r\nanything else, but that they also ate of the ducks and the turkeys.\r\n\r\n5. He, one day, determined to invite his friends to dine with him, in\r\nreturn for their civilities in inviting him; and he made up his mind to\r\nhave an abundance of those things, in particular, of which he had\r\nobserved his friends to be most fond.\r\n\r\n6. He accordingly sent his servant to market, to buy his dinner; and,\r\nfor fear the servant should make any mistake, he wrote his directions on\r\npaper, and, giving the paper, with some money, to the servant, he sent\r\nhim to the market.\r\n\r\n7. The servant took the paper and the money, and set off. Just before he\r\nreached the market, he opened the paper, to see what his master had\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n8. But his master wrote so very badly, it took him a long time to find\r\nout what was written on the paper; but, at last, he contrived to make\r\nit out, as follows:\r\n\r\n9. "Dukes would be preferred to Turks; but Chittens would be better than\r\neither."\r\n\r\n10. What his master meant by dukes, and turks, and chittens, he could\r\nnot guess. No such things were for sale at the market, and he did not\r\ndare to return home without buying something.\r\n\r\n11. As he could find nothing like dukes nor turks, he happened to see a\r\npoor woman carrying home a basket full of kittens. This was the most\r\nlike _chittens_ of anything he could find; and not being able to get\r\nwhat his master had written for, he thought his master meant kittens. He\r\ntherefore bought the basket of kittens, and carried them home for his\r\nmaster\'s dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIV.\r\n\r\n_Demos\'thenes._--ORIGINAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. There lived, a great many years ago, in Athens, one of the most\r\nrenowned cities of Greece, a very celebrated orator, whose name was\r\nDemos\'thenes.\r\n\r\n2. But you will not understand what an _orator_ is, until you are told\r\nthat it means a person who speaks before a large number of people, to\r\npersuade them what to do, or to give them information, or good advice.\r\n\r\n3. Thus, when a minister or clergyman preaches a good sermon, and speaks\r\nin such a manner as to please all who hear him, convincing them of their\r\nduty, and persuading them to do it, he is called an orator.\r\n\r\n4. Demos\'thenes was not a clergyman, or minister, but he spoke before\r\nlarge assemblies of the Athenians, and they were very much delighted to\r\nhear him. Whenever it was known that he intended to speak in public,\r\nevery one was anxious to hear him.\r\n\r\n5. Now, I wish to show you how hard he worked, and what he did, to\r\nbecome a great orator.\r\n\r\n6. In the first place, then, he had a very weak voice, and could not\r\nspeak loud enough to be heard by a large assembly; and, besides this, he\r\nwas very much troubled with shortness of breath. These were very great\r\ndiscouragements, and had he not labored very hard to overcome them, he\r\nnever could have succeeded.\r\n\r\n7. To cure his shortness of breath, he used to go up and down stairs\r\nvery frequently, and run up steep and uneven places; and to strengthen\r\nhis voice, he often went to the sea-shore, when the waves were very\r\nnoisy and violent, and talked aloud to them, so that he could hear his\r\nown voice above the noise of the waters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n8. He could not speak the letter _r_ plainly, but pronounced it very\r\nmuch as you have heard some little boys and girls pronounce it, when\r\nthey say a _wed wose_ for a _red rose_, or a _wipe cherwy_ instead of a\r\n_ripe cherry_.\r\n\r\n9. Besides this, he stammered, or stuttered, very badly. To cure himself\r\nof these faults in speaking, he used to fill his mouth full of pebbles,\r\nand try to speak with them in his mouth.\r\n\r\n10. He had a habit, also, of making up faces, when he was trying to\r\nspeak hard words; and, in order to cure himself of this, he used to\r\npractice speaking before a looking-glass, that he might see himself,\r\nand try to correct the habit.\r\n\r\n11. To break himself of a habit he had of shrugging up his shoulders,\r\nand making himself appear hump-backed, he hung up a sword over his back,\r\nso that it might prick him, with its sharp point, whenever he did so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n12. He shut himself up in a cave under ground, and, in order to confine\r\nhimself there to his studies, he shaved the hair off of one half of his\r\nhead, so that he might be ashamed to go out among men.\r\n\r\n13. It was in this way that this great man overcame all of his\r\ndifficulties, and, at last, became one of the greatest orators that have\r\never lived.\r\n\r\n14. Now, whenever you have a hard lesson to read, or to study, think of\r\nDemos\'thenes, and recollect how he overcame all his difficulties, and I\r\nthink you will find that you have few things to do so hard as these\r\nthings which he did.\r\n\r\n15. When your teacher requests you to put out your voice and speak loud,\r\nremember what Demos\'thenes used to do to strengthen his voice, and you\r\nwill find very little trouble in speaking loudly enough to be heard, if\r\nyou will only try.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XV.\r\n\r\n_Hard Words._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In one of the former lessons, you were taught how to read long and\r\nhard words, by taking them to pieces, and reading a part of a word at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n2. I promised you also that this book should not be filled with hard\r\nwords; but I did not promise that there should be no hard words in it.\r\n\r\n3. Having taught you how to read hard words, I propose, in this lesson,\r\nto give you a few long words to read,--not for the purpose of\r\nunderstanding what they mean, but only to make you able to read such\r\nwords, when you find them in any other book.\r\n\r\n4. The best way of getting rid of all difficulties, is to learn how to\r\novercome them, and master them; for they cease to be difficulties, when\r\nyou have overcome them.\r\n\r\n5. Demos\'thenes, as I told you in the last lesson, had a very hard task\r\nto perform, before he became a great orator. You, also, can become a\r\ngood scholar, if you will take pains to study your lessons, and learn\r\nthem well.\r\n\r\n6. Before you read any lesson to your teacher from this book, it is\r\nexpected that you will study it over, and find out all the most\r\ndifficult words, so that you may read them right off to him, without\r\nstopping to find them out, while he is waiting to hear you read them.\r\n\r\n7. Now, here I shall place a few hard words for you to study over, to\r\nread to your teacher when you read this lesson to him; and he will\r\nprobably require every one in your class to read them all aloud to him.\r\n\r\n8. I wish you not to go up to your teacher to ask him to assist you,\r\nuntil you have tried yourself to read them, and find that you cannot.\r\n\r\n9. There are some words that are not pronounced as they are spelt, as I\r\nhave taught you in a former lesson.\r\n\r\n10. Such a word as _phthisic_, which is pronounced as if it were spelled\r\n_tis\xc2\xb4ic_, I dare say would puzzle you, if you had never seen it before;\r\nbut before you go up to your teacher, to ask him any questions, you\r\nshould read over the whole of your lesson, and perhaps you will find, in\r\nthe lesson itself, something that will explain what puzzled you; and\r\nthus you could find it out from your book, without troubling your\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\n11. Here are some of the long words I wish you to read.\r\n\r\n12. Organization, Theoretical, Metaphysical, Metempsychosis,\r\nMultitudinous, Arithmetician, Metaphysician, Hyperbolical.\r\n\r\n13. Apotheosis, Indefeasible, Feasibility, Supersaturated, Prolongation,\r\nMeridional, Ferruginous, Fastidiousness.\r\n\r\n14. Haberdashery, Fuliginous, Exhalation, Prematurely, Depreciation,\r\nAppreciability, Resuscitate, Surreptitious, Interlocutory.\r\n\r\n15. Sometimes the letters _a e_, and _o e_, are printed together, like\r\none letter, as in the words C\xc3\xa6sar, Coelebs, and then the syllable is\r\npronounced as if it were spelled with _e_ alone, as in the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n16. Di\xc3\xa6resis, Aph\xc3\xa6resis, OEcumenical, \xc3\x86thiop, Subpoena,\r\nEncyclop\xc3\xa6dia, Phoenix, Phoebus, \xc3\x86olus.\r\n\r\n17. When there are two little dots over one of the letters, they are\r\nboth to be sounded, as in the word A\xc3\xabrial, which is pronounced\r\na-e-ri-al.\r\n\r\n18. The letter _c_ is one which puzzles many young persons who are\r\nlearning to read, because it is sometimes pronounced like _k_, as in the\r\nword _can_, and sometimes like _s_, as in the word _cent_; and they do\r\nnot know when to pronounce it like _k_, and when to sound it like _s_.\r\n\r\n19. But if you will recollect that _c_ is sounded like _k_ when it\r\nstands before the letters _a_, _o_, or _u_, and that it is sounded like\r\n_s_ before the letters _e_, _i_, and _y_, you will have very little\r\ntrouble in reading words that have the letter _c_ in them.\r\n\r\n20. So also the letter _g_ has two sounds, called the hard sound, and\r\nthe soft sound. The hard sound is the sound given to it in the word\r\n_gone_; the soft sound is that which is heard in the word _gentle_.\r\n\r\n21. The same rule which you have just learnt with regard to the letter\r\n_c_ applies to the letter _g_. It has its hard sound before _a_, _o_,\r\nand _u_, and its soft sound before _e_, _i_, and _y_.\r\n\r\n22. There are, it is true, some words where this rule is not applied;\r\nbut these words are very few, so that you may safely follow this rule in\r\nmost words.\r\n\r\n23. The letters _ph_ are sounded like _f_. The letters _ch_ are sounded\r\nsometimes like _k_, as in the words _loch_ and _monarch_, and sometimes\r\nlike _sh_, as in the words _chaise_ and _charade_; and they have\r\nsometimes a sound which cannot be represented by any other letters, as\r\nin the words _charm_ and _chance_.\r\n\r\n24. I suppose that you have probably learned most of these things which\r\nI have now told you in your spelling-book; but I have repeated them in\r\nthis book, because I have so often found that little boys and girls are\r\nvery apt to forget what they have learned.\r\n\r\n25. If you recollect them all, it will do you no harm to read them\r\nagain, but it will impress them more deeply on your memory. But if you\r\nhave forgotten them, this little book will recall them to your mind, so\r\nthat you will never forget them.\r\n\r\n26. I recollect, when I was a little boy, that the letter _y_ used to\r\ntrouble me very much when it began a word, and was not followed by one\r\nof the letters which are called vowels, namely, _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_.\r\nI knew how to pronounce _ya_, _ye_, _yi_, _yo_, _yu_; but one day, when\r\nI was studying a lesson in geography, I saw a word which was spelt _Y,\r\np, r, e, s_, which puzzled me very much.\r\n\r\n27. I knew that the letters _p, r, e, s_, would spell _pres_, but I did\r\nnot know what to call the _y_. After studying it a long time, I found\r\nthat the letter _y_, in that word and some others, was to be pronounced\r\nlike the long _e_, and that the word was pronounced _Epres_, though it\r\nwas spelled _Y, p, r, e, s_.\r\n\r\n28. Perhaps you will be able, when you grow up, to write a book; and to\r\ntell little boys and girls who go to school, when you have grown up, how\r\nto read hard words, better than I have told you.\r\n\r\n29. If you wish to do so, you must try to recollect what puzzles you\r\nmost now, and then you will be able to inform them how to get over their\r\ndifficulties and troubles at school; and when they grow up, I have no\r\ndoubt that they will feel very grateful to you for the assistance you\r\nhave given them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVI.\r\n\r\n_Fire,[A]--a Conversation between a Mother and her little Daughter._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Mother dear, you told me, the other day, that nobody knows\r\nwhat _light_ is, except the Great Creator. Now, can you tell me _what\r\nfire is_?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ I fear, my child, that you have asked another question which I\r\ncannot directly answer. What fire is, is known only by its effects.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ And what are its effects, mother?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Some of its effects are as well known to you, my dear, as they\r\nare to me; and I shall, in the first place, call to your recollection\r\nwhat you yourself know about _fire_, before I attempt to give you any\r\nfurther information in relation to it.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, mother, I am sure I do not know what fire is.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ No, Caroline, I know that you do not know what fire is;\r\nneither do I, nor does any one, except the Great Creator himself. This\r\nis one of his secrets, which, in his wisdom, he reserves for himself.\r\n\r\nBut you certainly know some of the effects of fire. For instance, you\r\nknow that when you have been out into the cold, you wish, on your\r\nreturn, to go to the fire. Now, can you tell me what you go to the fire\r\nfor?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, certainly, mother; I go to the fire to warm myself.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ And how does the fire warm you, my dear?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, it sends out its heat, mother; and I hold out my hands\r\nto it, and feel the heat.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ And where does the heat come from, Caroline?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, the heat comes from the fire, mother.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Then, my dear, you know at least one of the effects of fire.\r\nIt produces, or rather sends out, heat.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ But does not the fire make the heat, mother?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ If you had a little bird, or a mouse, in a cage, and should\r\nopen the door and let it out, should you say that you _made_ the little\r\nbird, or the mouse?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Say that I made them, mother?--why, no; certainly not. I\r\nonly let them go free. God made them. You told me that God made all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Neither did the fire make the heat. It only made it free,\r\nsomewhat in the same manner that you would make the bird or the mouse\r\nfree, by opening the door of the cage.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, mother, is heat kept in cages, like birds or mice?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ No, my dear, not exactly in cages, like birds or mice; but a\r\ngreat deal closer, in a different kind of cage.\r\n\r\n_Daughter_ Why, mother, what sort of a cage can heat be kept in?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ I must answer your question, Caroline, by asking you another.\r\nWhen Alice makes her fire in the kitchen, how does she make it?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ She takes some wood, or some coal, and puts under it some\r\npine wood, which she calls kindling, and some shavings, and then takes a\r\nmatch and sets the shavings on fire, and very soon the fire is made.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ But does she not first do something to the match?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ O, yes; I forgot to say that she lights the match first, and\r\nthen sets fire to the shavings with the lighted match.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ But how does she light the match, my dear?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, mother, have you never seen her? She rubs one end of\r\nthe match on the box, where there is a little piece of sand-paper, and\r\nthat sets the match on fire.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Is there any fire in the sand-paper, Caroline?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, no, mother; certainly not.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Was there any fire in the match, before she lighted it?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, no, mother; if there had been, she would have had no\r\nneed to light it.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ You see, then, that fire came when she rubbed the match\r\nagainst the sand-paper; and that the fire was not in the sand-paper, nor\r\nin the match.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Yes, mother, but I did not see where it came from.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ I am going to explain that to you, my dear, in the next\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[A] This lesson, together with the two following lessons, is\r\ntaken from a little book, called "Juvenile Philosophy," published by\r\nMessrs. A.S. Barnes & Co., 51 John-street, New York. It consists of nine\r\nconversations, between a little girl and her mother, on the subjects,\r\nRain, Color, Vision or Sight, the Eye, Light, Fire, Heat and Wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVII.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Did you ever see a person rub his hands together, when he was\r\ncold?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ O yes, mother, a great many times. I have seen father come\r\nin from the cold, and rub his hands together, and afterwards hold them\r\nto the fire and rub them again, and then they get warm.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ And now, Caroline, take your hand and rub it quickly backwards\r\nand forwards, over that woolen table-cloth, on the table in the corner\r\nof the room, and tell me whether that will make your hand warm.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ O, yes, dear mother; I feel it grow warmer, the faster I rub\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Here are two small pieces of wood. Touch them to your cheek,\r\nand tell me whether they feel warm now.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ They do not feel warm, nor cold, mother.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Now rub them together quickly a little while, and then touch\r\nthem to your cheek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R]\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ O, dear, mother! they are so hot that they almost burnt my\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Yes, Caroline; and do you not recollect, when you read\r\nRobinson Crusoe, that his man Friday made a fire by rubbing two pieces\r\nof wood together?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ O, yes, dear mother; and I have often wondered why Alice\r\ncould not light her lire and the lamp in the same manner, without those\r\nmatches, which have so offensive a smell.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ It is very hard work, my dear, to obtain fire by rubbing two\r\npieces of wood together; and it would take too long a time to do it. The\r\ntwo pieces of wood would grow warm by a very little rubbing; but in\r\norder to make them take fire, they must be rubbed together a great\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ But, mother, if it takes so long a time to get fire by\r\nrubbing two pieces of wood together, why can Alice set the match on fire\r\nso easily by rubbing it once on the sand-paper?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ That is what I am about to explain to you, my dear. Here, take\r\nthis piece of paper and hold it up to the lamp.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ It has taken fire, mother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L]\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Now take this piece of pine wood, and hold that up to the lamp\r\nin the same manner, and see whether that will take fire too.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Yes, mother, it has taken fire; but I had to hold it up to\r\nthe lamp much longer than I did the paper.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Now take this piece of hard wood, and do the same with that.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ The hard wood takes longer still to catch fire, mother.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Yes, my child. And now I am going to make the hard wood take\r\nfire more quickly than the paper did.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Dear mother, how can you do it?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ I am going to show you, my dear. Here is a small phial, which\r\ncontains something that looks like water. It is spirits of turpentine. I\r\nshall dip the point of the piece of hard wood into the phial, and take\r\nup a little of the spirits of turpentine. Now, Caroline, touch the point\r\nof the hard wood with the turpentine on it to the flame.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, mother, it caught fire as soon as I touched the flame\r\nwith it!\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Yes, certainly; and you now see that some things, like the\r\nspirits of turpentine and the paper, take fire very readily, and others\r\ntake fire with more difficulty.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Yes, mother; but when Alice drew the match across the\r\nsand-paper, there was no flame nor fire to touch it to. How, then, could\r\nit take fire?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Hold this piece of paper up to the blaze of the lamp, my dear,\r\nbut be careful not to touch the fire or flame of the lamp; only hold it\r\nclose to the blaze.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, mother, it has taken fire!\r\n\r\n_Mother._ You see, then, that a thing will sometimes take fire when it\r\ndoes not touch the fire.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Yes, mother; but I do not understand where the fire comes\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ The fire comes from the heat, my dear. Now, you know that heat\r\nis produced by rubbing two things together; and that some things, like\r\nthe spirits of turpentine, take fire very easily, or with very little\r\nheat; and others, like the hard wood, require to be heated some\r\ntime,--or, in other words, require much heat,--to make them take fire,\r\nor to burn. Some things require only as much heat to make them take fire\r\nas can be obtained by rubbing them together very quickly, like the wood\r\nwhich Robinson Crusoe\'s man Friday used.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ But, mother, the match is made of wood,--why does that take\r\nfire so easily?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ It is true, Caroline, that the match is made of wood; but it\r\nhas something at the end of it, which takes fire much more easily than\r\nthe spirits of turpentine. Indeed, so easily does it take fire, that it\r\nrequires only so much heat to set it on fire as can be obtained by\r\ndrawing the match once across the sand-paper.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ But, mother, matches do not always take fire. I have seen\r\nAlice rub several across the sand-paper, before she could set one on\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ That is true, and the reason of this is, that the matches are\r\nnot all well made. Now, if I should take several pieces of hard wood and\r\ntie them together, and dip their ends into the spirits of turpentine,\r\nwhat would happen, if the ends of some of the pieces did not touch the\r\nspirits of turpentine, because I had not tied them together with their\r\npoints all even?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, mother, some of them would take fire easily, because\r\nthe points had the spirits of turpentine on them; while those which did\r\nnot touch the spirits could not be lighted so easily.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ So it is, my dear, with the matches. They are all dipped into\r\nthe substance which takes fire so easily; but some of the ends do not\r\nreach the substance, and do not become coated with it, and therefore\r\nthey will not light more easily than the pine wood of which they are\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVIII.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, concluded._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Well, mother, I understand, now, how the match is set on\r\nfire. It is rubbed on the sand-paper, and that produces heat, and the\r\nheat sets the match on fire. But I always thought that fire makes heat,\r\nand not that heat makes fire.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Heat does not always make fire, Caroline; for, if it did,\r\neverything would be on fire.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Everything on fire, mother! why, what do you mean?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ I mean, my dear, that everything contains heat.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Everything contains heat, mother, did you say? Why, then, is\r\nnot everything warm? Some things, mother, are very cold; as ice, and\r\nsnow, and that marble slab.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Yes, my child, everything contains heat, as I shall presently\r\nshow you. When Alice goes to make a fire in a cold day, she does not\r\ncarry the heat with her, and put it into the fire, nor into the wood,\r\nnor the coal, does she?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, no, to be sure not, mother.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ And the heat that comes from the fire, after it is made, does\r\nnot come in at the windows, nor down the chimney, does it?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, no, mother; it feels cold at the windows, and cold air\r\ncomes down the chimney.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ But, after the fire is made, we feel much heat coming from the\r\nfire, do we not?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, yes, mother; that is what the fire is made for. We feel\r\ncold, and we want a fire to make us warm; and when the fire is made, it\r\nsends out heat, and makes us warm.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Well, now, where can the heat come from? You know what fire is\r\nmade from, do you not?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Certainly, mother; the fire is made of wood, or of coal.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ But is the wood or the coal warm before the fire is made?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ No, mother, the wood and the coal come from the cold\r\nwood-house, or the cellar, and they are both very cold.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ And yet, the wood and the coal become very hot when they are\r\non fire.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ O yes, mother, so hot that we cannot touch them with our\r\nhands, and we have to take the shovel or the tongs to move them.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ And do they burn the shovel and the tongs, my dear?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ Why, no, mother; if they did, the shovel and the tongs would\r\nbe of little use in stirring the fire.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Can you think of any reason why they do not burn the shovel\r\nand the tongs?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ You told me, mother, that some things require a very little\r\nheat to set them on fire, and that other things require a great deal. I\r\nsuppose that there was not heat enough to set them on fire; and if there\r\nhad been, they would not burn, because they are made of iron.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ You are partly right, my dear, and partly wrong. They would\r\nnot burn, because there was not heat enough in the fire to burn them.\r\nBut there are very few things, and in fact it may be doubted whether\r\nthere is anything, which will not burn, when sufficient heat is applied.\r\nBut let us return to the fire: you say the heat does not come from the\r\nwindows nor from the chimney, and you say, also, that the wood and the\r\ncoal are both cold. Now, where can the heat come from?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ I am sure I cannot tell, mother; will you please to tell me?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ You recollect that I told you that the rubbing of the match on\r\nthe sand-paper produces a little heat, which caused the match to burn.\r\nThe match was then applied to the shavings, and, as it was burning, gave\r\nout heat enough to set the shavings on fire; the shavings produced heat\r\nenough to set the pine wood, or kindling, on fire, and then the pine\r\nwood, or kindling, produced more heat, and set the wood and coal on\r\nfire. Now, there was nothing to produce the heat but the match, the\r\nshavings, the wood and the coal; and _the heat must have been in them_.\r\nThe fire only served to set it free, and let it come out of the match,\r\nthe wood, and the coal.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ But, mother, how did the heat get into the wood and coal?\r\n\r\n_Mother._ It is not known, my dear, how the heat _got into_ the wood and\r\ncoal, any more than how the fruit gets on to a tree. We say that it\r\ngrows on the tree; but what growing is, and how it is caused, are among\r\nthe secrets of God.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ If the heat is in the wood and the coal, mother, why do we\r\nnot feel it in them? They both feel cold. I cannot perceive any heat in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ The heat is in the wood and the coal, although you do not see\r\nit. Do you see any smoke in the wood and the coal, my dear?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ No, mother, I do not.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Did you never see a stick of wood fall on the hearth from the\r\nkitchen fire, and see the smoke coming from it?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ O yes, mother, very often; and the smoke goes all over the\r\nroom, and into my eyes, and makes the tears come into my eyes.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ And can you see the smoke in the wood before the wood is put\r\non the fire?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ No, mother, I am sure I cannot.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ But you are sure that the smoke comes from the wood, are you\r\nnot?\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ O yes, mother; I see it coming right out of the wood.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Then, my dear, I suppose you know that if there is something\r\nin the wood and coal, which you call _smoke_, although you cannot see\r\nit until it comes out, you can easily conceive how another thing, which\r\nwe call _heat_, can be in the wood and coal, which we cannot perceive\r\nuntil it is made to come out.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ O yes, mother; how wonderful it is!\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Yes, my dear, all the works of God are wonderful; and what is\r\nvery surprising is, that many of his most wonderful works are so common,\r\nso continually before our eyes, that we do not deem them wonderful until\r\nwe have been made to think much about them, by talking about them, as\r\nyou and I have talked about the rain, and the clouds, and light, and its\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\n_Daughter._ I have been thinking, mother, about Alice and the fire. You\r\ntold me that the fire did not _make_ the heat, any more than I _make_\r\nthe little mouse or the bird when I open the cage door and let them out.\r\nI see now how it is. Alice brings the wood and the coal into the kitchen\r\nfireplace, and the match lets the heat out of the shavings, and the\r\nshavings let it out of the wood and the coal, until we get heat enough\r\nto make us warm.\r\n\r\n_Mother._ Yes, my dear; and there is no more heat in the room after the\r\nfire is made than there was before,--only, before the fire was made,\r\nthe heat was hid, and we could not perceive it; but when the fire is\r\nmade, it makes the heat come out, and makes it free, just as I make the\r\nlittle bird free, by opening his cage door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIX.\r\n\r\n_The Lark and her Young Ones._--Altered from \xc3\x86SOP.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A lark having built her nest in a corn-field, the corn grew ripe\r\nbefore the young ones were able to fly. Fearing that the reapers would\r\ncome to cut down the corn before she had provided a safe place for her\r\nlittle ones, she directed them every day, when she went out to obtain\r\ntheir food, to listen to what the farmers should say about reaping the\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\n2. The little birds promised their mother that they would listen very\r\nattentively, and inform her of every word they should hear.\r\n\r\n3. She then went abroad; and on her return, the little birds said to\r\ntheir mother, Mother, you must take us away from here; for while you\r\nwere gone we heard the farmer tell his sons to go and ask some of his\r\nneighbors to come to-morrow morning early, and help them cut down the\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\n4. Is that what he said? asked their mother. Yes, mother, said the\r\nlittle birds; and we are very much afraid that you cannot find a safe\r\nplace for us before the farmer and his neighbors begin to cut down the\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\n5. Do not be afraid, my children, said the lark; if the former depends\r\non his neighbors to do his work for him, we shall be safe where we are.\r\nSo lie down in the nest, and give yourselves no uneasiness.\r\n\r\n6. The next day, when the mother went out for food, she directed the\r\nlittle ones again to listen, and to tell her all that they should hear.\r\n\r\n7. In the evening, when she returned, the little ones told her that the\r\nfarmer\'s neighbors did not come to assist him on that day; and that the\r\nfarmer had told his sons to go and request his friends and relations to\r\ncome and assist him to cut down the corn, early in the next day morning.\r\n\r\n8. I think, my children, said the lark, we shall still be safe here; and\r\nwe will, therefore, feel no anxiety or concern to-night.\r\n\r\n9. On the third day, the mother again charged the young larks to give\r\nher a faithful report of what was done and said, while she was absent.\r\n\r\n10. When the old lark returned that evening, the little larks told her\r\nthat the farmer had been there, with his sons, early in the morning;\r\nbut, as his friends and relations had not come to assist him, he had\r\ndirected his sons to bring some sharp sickles early in the next morning,\r\nand that, with their assistance, he should reap the corn himself.\r\n\r\n11. Ah! said the mother, did he say so? Then it is time for us to\r\nprepare to be gone; for when a man begins to think seriously of doing\r\nhis work himself, there is some prospect that it will be done; but if he\r\ndepends on his friends, his neighbors, or his relations, no one can tell\r\nwhen his work will be done.\r\n\r\n12. Now, this little story is called a Fable. It cannot be true, because\r\nbirds do not and cannot speak.\r\n\r\n13. But, although it is not true, it is a very useful little story,\r\nbecause it teaches us a valuable lesson: and that is, that it is best to\r\ndo our own work ourselves, rather than to depend upon others to do it\r\nfor us; for, if we depend upon them, they may disappoint us, but\r\nwhatever we determine to do for ourselves, we can easily accomplish, if\r\nwe go right to work about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XX.\r\n\r\n_Dogs._--ORIGINAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I never knew a little boy that was not fond of a dog, and I have\r\nnever seen many dogs which were not fond of little children.\r\n\r\n2. It is not safe for little children to touch every strange dog that\r\nthey see, because some dogs are naturally rather cross, and may possibly\r\nbite any one who touches them, when they do not know the persons.\r\n\r\n3. But when a dog knows any one, and sees that his master is fond of\r\nthat person, he will let such a person play with him. He is always\r\npleased with any attentions that his master\'s friends bestow on him.\r\n\r\n4. Large dogs are generally more gentle than small ones, and seldom bark\r\nso much as the little ones do. They are also more easily taught to carry\r\nbundles and baskets, and draw little carriages for children to ride in.\r\n\r\n5. Some people are very much afraid of dogs, because they sometimes run\r\nmad. The bite of a mad dog produces a very dreadful disease, called\r\n_Hydropho\'bia_.\r\n\r\n6. This is a long and hard word, and means _a fear of water_. It is\r\ncalled by that name because the person who has the disease cannot bear\r\nto touch or to see water.\r\n\r\n7. Dogs that are mad cannot bear to see water. They run from it with\r\ndreadful cries, and seem to be in very great distress.\r\n\r\n8. Whenever, therefore, a dog will drink water, it is a pretty sure sign\r\nthat he is not mad.\r\n\r\n9. This dreadful disease very seldom affects dogs that are properly\r\nsupplied with water.\r\n\r\n10. Dogs require a great deal of water. They do not always want much at\r\na time, and it is seldom that they drink much. But whoever keeps a dog\r\nought always to keep water in such a place that the dog may go to it to\r\ndrink, whenever he requires it.\r\n\r\n11. A dog is a very affectionate animal, and he will permit his master,\r\nand his master\'s children and friends, to do a great many things to him,\r\nwhich he would perhaps bite others for doing.\r\n\r\n12. There are many very interesting stories told of dogs, which show\r\ntheir love and fidelity to their masters, which you can read in a book\r\ncalled "Anecdotes of Dogs."\r\n\r\n13. But there are a few little stories about dogs that I know, which I\r\nwill tell you, that are not contained in that book. I know these\r\nstories to be true.\r\n\r\n14. My son had a dog, whose name was Guido. He was very fond of playing\r\nin the street with the boys, early in the morning, before they went to\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n15. Guido was always very impatient to get out into the street in the\r\nmorning, to join the boys in their sports; and all the boys in the\r\nstreet were very fond of him.\r\n\r\n16. He used to wake very early, and go into the parlor, and seat himself\r\nin a chair by the window, to look out for the boys; and as soon as he\r\nsaw a boy in the street, he would cry and whine until the servant opened\r\nthe door for him to go out.\r\n\r\n17. One very cold morning, when the frost was on the glass, so that he\r\ncould not see out into the street, he applied his warm tongue to the\r\nglass, and licking from it the frost, attempted to look out.\r\n\r\n18. But the spot which he had made clear being only large enough to\r\nadmit one of his eyes, he immediately made another, just like it, in the\r\nsame manner, for the other eye, by which he was enabled to enjoy the\r\nsight as usual. In the next lesson, I will tell you some other little\r\nstories of Guido, and another dog, whose name was Don, that belonged to\r\nmy daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXI.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, concluded._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. One day I went to take a walk, with a friend of mine, in the country;\r\nand Don, the dog I mentioned in the last lesson, followed us.\r\n\r\n2. We walked to a little grove about a mile from my house, to see the\r\ngrave of a beautiful little child, that was buried on the summit of a\r\nlittle hill, covered with pines, spruce and other evergreens.\r\n\r\n3. While we were admiring the beauty of the spot, Don was running about\r\nthe grove; and I completely lost sight of him, and supposed that he had\r\nreturned home.\r\n\r\n4. But presently I saw him at a distance, barking up a tree at a\r\nsquirrel that had escaped from him.\r\n\r\n5. As I turned to go home, I said to my friend, You see Don is away, and\r\ndoes not see me. I am going to drop my handkerchief here, and send him\r\nafter it.\r\n\r\n6. We had got half way home, when presently Don came bounding along, and\r\nvery shortly came up to us.\r\n\r\n7. As soon as he came up to me, I stopped, and feeling in my\r\ncoat-pocket, said to him,--Don, I have lost my pocket-handkerchief,--go\r\nfind it.\r\n\r\n8. I had scarcely uttered the words before he was off. He was gone only\r\ntwo or three minutes, and then, returning with my handkerchief in his\r\nmouth, he dropped it at my feet.\r\n\r\n9. Guido, the other dog, was very fond of going into the water himself;\r\nbut he never would allow any one else to go in.\r\n\r\n10. The reason was this. My little son George was one day looking over\r\ninto the water, to watch the eels that were gliding through the water\r\nbelow, and losing his balance, he fell into the water.\r\n\r\n11. No one was near except Guido, and he immediately jumped in after\r\nGeorge, and, with great labor, brought him on shore, and saved him from\r\ndrowning.\r\n\r\n12. Ever since that time, Guido has been very unwilling to let any one\r\ngo near the water. It seemed as if he had reasoned about it, and said to\r\nhimself, It is hard work to drag a boy out of the water, but it is much\r\neasier to keep him from going in.\r\n\r\n13. Guido was not a very large dog. He was of the breed, or kind, named\r\nSpaniel; so called because that kind of dog originally came from\r\nHispaniola. He had long ears, curling hair, a long bushy tail, and\r\nwebbed feet, like all dogs that are fond of the water.\r\n\r\n14. Webbed feet are those in which the toes are not separated, but seem\r\nto be joined together by a thin substance, like thick skin, which\r\nenables them to swim more easily.\r\n\r\n15. Don was a very large dog, of the Newfoundland species, a kind which\r\nis remarkable for its beauty and intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXII.\r\n\r\n_Frogs and Toads._--BIGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Frogs and toads resemble one another in figure, but custom and\r\nprejudice have taught us to make a very different estimate of their\r\nproperties: the first is considered as perfectly harmless, while the\r\nlatter is supposed to be poisonous.\r\n\r\n2. In this respect, the toad has been treated with great injustice: it\r\nis a torpid, harmless animal, that passes the greatest part of the\r\nwinter in sleep.\r\n\r\n3. Astonishing stories have been told of toads found in the center of\r\nsolid blocks of stone, and other similar situations, without the least\r\ntrace of the way by which they entered, and without any possibility of\r\ntheir finding any kind of nutriment.\r\n\r\n4. Toads, as well as frogs, are of a variety of species; and in the\r\ntropical climates they grow to an enormous size. It is very probable\r\nthat they contribute to clear both the land and the water of many\r\nnoxious reptiles of a diminutive size, which might prove exceedingly\r\nhurtful to man.\r\n\r\n5. The toad, however, is one of the most inoffensive of all animals. We\r\nhave even heard that it has sometimes been successfully applied for the\r\ncure of the cancer, the most dreadful, and one of the most fatal, of\r\nhuman evils.\r\n\r\n6. Mr. Pennant has related some interesting particulars respecting a\r\ntoad which was perfectly domesticated, and continued in the same spot\r\nfor upwards of thirty-six years.\r\n\r\n7. It frequented the steps before the hall-door of a gentleman\'s house\r\nin Devonshire; and, from receiving a regular supply of food, it became\r\nso tame as always to crawl out of its hole in an evening, when a candle\r\nwas brought, and look up, as if expecting to be carried into the house.\r\n\r\n8. A reptile so generally detested being taken into favor, excited the\r\ncuriosity of every visitant; and even ladies so far conquered their\r\nnatural horror and disgust as to request to see it fed. It seemed\r\nparticularly fond of flesh maggots, which were kept for it in bran.\r\n\r\n9. When these were laid upon a table, it would follow them, and, at a\r\ncertain distance, would fix its eyes and remain motionless for a little\r\nwhile, as if preparing for the stroke, which was always instantaneous.\r\n\r\n10. It threw out its tongue to a great distance, when the insect stuck\r\nby the glutinous matter to its lip, and was swallowed with inconceivable\r\nquickness.\r\n\r\n11. After living under the protection of its benefactor upwards of\r\nthirty-six years, it was one day attacked by a tame raven, which wounded\r\nit so severely that it died shortly afterward.\r\n\r\n12. The erroneous opinion of toads containing and ejecting poison has\r\ncaused many cruelties to be exercised upon this harmless, and\r\nundoubtedly useful tribe. Toads have been inhumanly treated, merely\r\nbecause they are ugly; and frogs have been abused, because they are like\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n13. But, we are to observe, that our ideas of beauty and deformity, of\r\nwhich some arise from natural antipathies implanted in us for wise and\r\ngood purposes, and others from custom and caprice, are of a relative\r\nnature, and peculiar to ourselves.\r\n\r\n14. None of these relative distinctions, of great and small, beautiful\r\nor ugly, exist in the all-comprising view of the Creator of the\r\nuniverse: in his eyes, the toad is as pleasing an object as the\r\ncanary-bird, or the bulfinch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIII.\r\n\r\n_Maida, the Scotch Greyhound._--Altered from BINGLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. A hound is a dog with long, smooth, hanging ears, and long limbs,\r\nthat enable him to run very swiftly. The greyhound is not so called on\r\naccount of his color, but from a word which denotes his Grecian origin.\r\n\r\n2. The Scotch greyhound is a larger and more powerful animal than the\r\ncommon greyhound; and its hair, instead of being sleek and smooth, is\r\nlong, stiff and bristly. It can endure great fatigue.\r\n\r\n3. It was this dog that the Highland chieftains, in Scotland, used in\r\nformer times, in their grand hunting-parties.\r\n\r\n4. Sir Walter Scott had a very fine dog of this kind, which was given to\r\nhim by his friend Macdonnel of Glengarry, the chief of one of the\r\nHighland clans. His name was Maida.\r\n\r\n5. He was one of the finest dogs of the kind ever seen in Scotland, not\r\nonly on account of his beauty and dignified appearance, but also from\r\nhis extraordinary size and strength.\r\n\r\n6. He was so remarkable in his appearance, that whenever his master\r\nbrought him to the city of Edinburgh, great crowds of people collected\r\ntogether to see him.\r\n\r\n7. When Sir Walter happened to travel through a strange town, Maida was\r\nusually surrounded by crowds of people, whose curiosity he indulged with\r\ngreat patience, until it began to be troublesome, and then he gave a\r\nsingle short bark, as a signal that they must trouble him no more.\r\n\r\n8. Nothing could exceed the fidelity, obedience and attachment, of this\r\ndog to his master, whom he seldom quitted, and on whom he was a\r\nconstant attendant, when traveling.\r\n\r\n9. Maida was a remarkably high-spirited and beautiful dog, with long\r\nblack ears, cheeks, back, and sides. The tip of his tail was white. His\r\nmuzzle, neck, throat, breast, belly and legs, were also white.\r\n\r\n10. The hair on his whole body and limbs was rough and shaggy, and\r\nparticularly so on the neck, throat, and breast: that on the ridge of\r\nthe neck he used to raise, like a lion\'s mane, when excited to anger.\r\n\r\n11. His disposition was gentle and peaceable, both to men and animals;\r\nbut he showed marked symptoms of anger to ill-dressed or\r\nblackguard-looking people, whom he always regarded with a suspicious\r\neye, and whose motions he watched with the most scrupulous jealousy.\r\n\r\n12. This fine dog probably brought on himself premature old age, by the\r\nexcessive fatigue and exercise to which his natural ardor incited him;\r\nfor he had the greatest pleasure in accompanying the common greyhounds;\r\nand although, from his great size and strength, he was not at all\r\nadapted for coursing, he not unfrequently turned and even ran down\r\nhares.\r\n\r\n13. Sir Walter used to give an amusing account of an incident which\r\nbefell Maida in one of his chases. "I was once riding over a field on\r\nwhich the reapers were at work, the stooks, or bundles of grain, being\r\nplaced behind them, as is usual.\r\n\r\n14. "Maida, having found a hare, began to chase her, to the great\r\namusement of the spectators, as the hare turned very often and very\r\nswiftly among the stooks. At length, being hard pressed, she fairly\r\nbolted into one of them.\r\n\r\n15. "Maida went in headlong after her, and the stook began to be much\r\nagitated in various directions; at length the sheaves tumbled down, and\r\nthe hare and the dog, terrified alike at their overthrow, ran different\r\nways, to the great amusement of the spectators."\r\n\r\n16. Among several peculiarities which Maida possessed, one was a strong\r\naversion to artists, arising from the frequent restraints he was\r\nsubjected to in having his portrait taken, on account of his majestic\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n17. The instant he saw a pencil and paper produced, he prepared to beat\r\na retreat; and, if forced to remain, he exhibited the strongest marks of\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\n18. Maida\'s bark was deep and hollow. Sometimes he amused himself with\r\nhowling in a very tiresome way. When he was very fond of his friends,\r\nhe used to grin, tucking up his whole lips and showing all his teeth;\r\nbut this was only when he was particularly disposed to recommend\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n19. Maida lies buried at the gate of Abbotsford, Sir Walter\'s country\r\nseat, which he long protected; a grave-stone is placed over him, on\r\nwhich is carved the figure of a dog. It bears the following inscription,\r\nas it was translated by Sir Walter:\r\n\r\n    "Beneath the sculptured form which late you wore,\r\n     Sleep soundly, Maida, at your master\'s door."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIV.\r\n\r\n_Gelert._--BINGLEY, altered.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I have one more story to tell you about the Highland greyhound. It is\r\nan old Welsh story, and shows how extremely dangerous it is to indulge\r\nin anger and resentment.\r\n\r\n2. In a village at the foot of Snowden, a mountain in Wales, there is a\r\ntradition that Llewellyn (_pronounced_ Lewel\xc2\xb4lin), son-in-law to King\r\nJohn, had a residence in that neighborhood.\r\n\r\n3. The king, it is said, had presented him with one of the finest\r\ngreyhounds in England, named Gelert. In the year 1205, Llewellyn, one\r\nday, on going out to hunt, called all his dogs together; but his\r\nfavorite greyhound was missing, and nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\n4. He blew his horn as a signal for the chase, and still Gelert came\r\nnot. Llewellyn was much disconcerted at the heedlessness of his\r\nfavorite, but at length pursued the chase without him. For want of\r\nGelert, the sport was limited; and getting tired, Llewellyn returned\r\nhome at an early hour, when the first object that presented itself to\r\nhim, at his castle gate, was Gelert, who bounded, with his usual\r\ntransport, to meet his master, having his lips besmeared with blood.\r\n\r\n5. Llewellyn gazed with surprise at the unusual appearance of his dog.\r\nOn going into the apartment where he had left his infant son and heir\r\nasleep, he found the bed-clothes all in confusion, the cover rent, and\r\nstained with blood.\r\n\r\n6. He called on his child, but no answer was made, from which he hastily\r\nconcluded that the dog must have devoured him; and, giving vent to his\r\nrage, plunged his sword to the hilt in Gelert\'s side.\r\n\r\n7. The noble animal fell at his feet, uttering a dying yell, which\r\nawoke the infant, who was sleeping beneath a mingled heap of the\r\nbed-clothes, while beneath the bed lay a great wolf covered with gore,\r\nwhich the faithful and gallant hound had destroyed.\r\n\r\n8. Llewellyn, smitten with sorrow and remorse for the rash and frantic\r\ndeed which had deprived him of so faithful an animal, caused an elegant\r\nmarble monument, with an appropriate inscription, to be erected over the\r\nspot where Gelert was buried, to commemorate his fidelity and unhappy\r\nfate. The place, to this day, is called Beth-Gelert, or The Grave of the\r\nGreyhound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXV.\r\n\r\n_Knock Again._--CHILD\'S COMPANION.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I remember having been sent, when I was a very little boy, with a\r\nmessage from my father to a particular friend of his, who resided in the\r\nsuburbs of the town in which my parents then lived.\r\n\r\n2. This gentleman occupied an old-fashioned house, the door of which was\r\napproached by a broad flight of stone steps of a semi-circular form. The\r\nbrass knocker was an object of much interest to me, in those days; for\r\nthe whim of the maker had led him to give it the shape of an elephant\'s\r\nhead, the trunk of the animal being the movable portion.\r\n\r\n3. Away, then, I scampered, in great haste; and having reached the\r\nhouse, ran up the stone steps as usual; and, seizing the elephant\'s\r\ntrunk, made the house re\xc3\xabcho to my knocking. No answer was returned.\r\n\r\n4. At this my astonishment was considerable, as the servants, in the\r\ntimes I write of, were more alert and attentive than they are at\r\npresent. However, I knocked a second time. Still no one came.\r\n\r\n5. At this I was much more surprised. I looked at the house. It\r\npresented no appearance of a desertion. Some of the windows were open to\r\nadmit the fresh air, for it was summer; others of them were closed. But\r\nall had the aspect of an inhabited dwelling.\r\n\r\n6. I was greatly perplexed; and looked around, to see if any one was\r\nnear who could advise me how to act. Immediately a venerable old\r\ngentleman, whom I had never seen before, came across the way, and,\r\nlooking kindly in my face, advised me to knock again.\r\n\r\n7. I did so without a moment\'s hesitation, and presently the door was\r\nopened, so that I had an opportunity of delivering my message. I\r\nafterward learned that the servants had been engaged in removing a heavy\r\npiece of furniture from one part of the house to the other; an operation\r\nwhich required their united strength, and prevented them from opening\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXVI.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. As I was tripping lightly homeward, I passed the kind old gentleman,\r\nabout half way down the street. He took me gently by the arm; and,\r\nretaining his hold, began to address me thus, as we walked on together:\r\n\r\n2. "The incident, my little friend, which has just occurred, may be of\r\nsome use to you in after life, if it be suitably improved. Young people\r\nare usually very enthusiastic in all their undertakings, and in the same\r\nproportion are very easily discouraged.\r\n\r\n3. "Learn, then, from what has taken place this morning, to persevere in\r\nthe business which you have commenced, provided it be laudable in\r\nitself; and, ten to one, you will succeed. If you do not at first\r\nobtain what you aim at, _knock again_. A door may be opened when you\r\nleast expect it.\r\n\r\n4. "In entering on the practice of a profession, engaging in trade, or\r\nwhat is usually called settling in the world, young people often meet\r\nwith great disappointments.\r\n\r\n5. "Friends, whom they naturally expected to employ them, not\r\nunfrequently prefer others in the same line; and even professors of\r\nreligion do not seem to consider it a duty to promote the temporal\r\ninterest of their brethren in the Lord.\r\n\r\n6. "Nevertheless, industry, sobriety, and patience, are usually\r\naccompanied by the Divine blessing. Should you therefore, my little\r\nfriend, ever experience disappointments of this kind, think of the brass\r\nknocker; _knock again_; be sober, be diligent, and your labors will be\r\nblessed.\r\n\r\n7. "In the pursuit of philosophy many difficulties are encountered.\r\nThese the student must expect to meet; but he must not relinquish the\r\ninvestigation of truth, because it seems to elude his search. He may\r\nknock at the gate of science, and apparently without being heard. But\r\nlet him _knock again_, and he will find an entrance."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXVII.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, concluded._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. "Do you ever pray to God? I hope and trust you do. God commands and\r\nencourages us to pray to him. But he does not always answer our prayers\r\nat the time, or in the way, we expect.\r\n\r\n2. "What then? We know that he hears them. We know that he is a gracious\r\nGod, a reconciled Father in Christ. Let us _knock again_. Let us ask in\r\nfaith, and, if what we ask be pleasing in his sight, he will grant it in\r\nhis own good time.\r\n\r\n3. "You know who it was that said, \'Ask, and it shall be given you;\r\nseek, and ye shall find; _knock_, and it shall be opened unto you: for\r\nevery one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to\r\nhim that _knocketh_, it shall be opened.\'\r\n\r\n4. "Once more: our progress in the Divine life, even after we have\r\nwholly given ourselves to the Lord, does not always equal our wishes or\r\nexpectations. We find much indwelling sin, much remaining corruption, to\r\nstruggle with.\r\n\r\n5. "But let us not despond. The grace of our Lord is sufficient for us,\r\nand his strength is made perfect in our weakness. Let us _knock again_.\r\n\r\n6. "Let us continue, with humble confidence, to do what we know to be\r\npleasing in our Master\'s sight. Let us work out our own salvation, with\r\nfear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in us both to will and to\r\ndo of his good pleasure."\r\n\r\n7. We had now reached the gate of my father\'s garden; and the good old\r\ngentleman, taking me kindly by the hand, bid me try to remember what he\r\nhad said. He then went his way, and I saw him no more.\r\n\r\n8. I afterward endeavored to find out who he was; but I did not succeed.\r\nHis advice, however, sunk deep into my mind, and has often been of\r\nsingular value to me since.\r\n\r\n9. My disposition is naturally sanguine, and my disappointments\r\nproportionably acute. But, upon calling to mind the old mansion, the\r\nbrass knocker, and my venerable counselor, I have frequently been led to\r\n_knock again_, when I might otherwise have sat down in despondency.\r\n\r\n10. I hope that many of my readers will derive similar benefit from the\r\nperusal of this little history; for the sole end of its publication will\r\nbe answered, if the young persons under whose eyes it may come be\r\ninduced, at every season of doubt and perplexity, in the exercise of\r\nsimple confidence in God, to _knock again_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXVIII\r\n\r\n_Make Good Use of your Time._--EMMA C. EMBURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "To everything there is a season, and a time for every\r\npurpose under heaven."]\r\n\r\n1. "My dear Anna," said Mrs. Elmore, as she bade her little girl\r\nfarewell, "I shall be absent ten days; and as you have already had so\r\nmany lessons from me respecting the manner of distributing your hours of\r\namusement and study, I will only say to you, now, \'_Make good use of\r\nyour time_.\'"\r\n\r\n2. Anna\'s eyes filled with tears as the carriage drove off, and she felt\r\nvery lonely when she returned to the parlor without her mother. She\r\nthought over her mother\'s parting words, until she felt quite proud of\r\nthe confidence reposed in her, and resolved not to abuse it by neglect.\r\n\r\n3. She accordingly took her books and sat down to her studies, as\r\nattentively as if her mother had been waiting to hear her recitation.\r\n\r\n4. Anna was an affectionate, intelligent child. She would have made any\r\nsacrifices to please her mother, and she really loved her studies; but\r\nher one great fault was a disposition to loiter away time.\r\n\r\n5. This her mother well knew; and after trying admonition, until she\r\nalmost feared she was increasing the evil by allowing Anna to depend too\r\nmuch upon her guidance, she determined to test the effect of leaving her\r\nto her own responsibility.\r\n\r\n6. For an hour after her mother\'s departure, Anna sat in close attention\r\nto her studies. All at once, she started up. "I am so hungry," said she,\r\n"I must go to Betty for some luncheon;--but stop--I will finish my\r\nexercise first."\r\n\r\n7. She wrote a line or two; then throwing down her pen, petulantly\r\nexclaimed, "There! I have made two mistakes, because I was in such a\r\nhurry;--I will not finish it till I come back."\r\n\r\n8. So away ran the little girl to her old nurse, and the next half-hour\r\nwas spent in satisfying her hunger. As she was returning, with laggard\r\nstep, she happened to spy, from the window, a beautiful butterfly\r\nfluttering about the rose-bushes in the garden; and, quite forgetting\r\nher unfinished exercise, away she flew in chase of the butterfly.\r\n\r\n9. But, agile as were her movements, the insect was too nimble for her;\r\nand after an hour\'s race beneath the burning sun, she returned, flushed\r\nand overheated, without having succeeded in its capture.\r\n\r\n10. Again she applied herself to her books; but study was not so easy\r\nnow as it would have been a little earlier. Anna was too tired to apply\r\nher mind to her lessons; and after loitering a while over her desk, she\r\nthrew herself on the sofa, and fell into a sound sleep, from which she\r\nwas only awakened by a summons to dinner.\r\n\r\n11. After dinner, Betty proposed taking her out to walk; and though\r\nconscious that she had not performed half her duties, she had not\r\nresolution enough to refuse to go. Tying on her bonnet, she took a\r\nlittle basket on her arm, and set out with Betty to gather\r\nwild-flowers.\r\n\r\n12. When they reached the woods, Betty sought out a mossy seat under an\r\nold tree, and, taking her work from her pocket, began to sew as\r\nindustriously as if she had been at home.\r\n\r\n13. "O Betty!" exclaimed Anna, "how can you sit and sew, when there are\r\nso many pleasant sights and sounds around you?"\r\n\r\n14. "I can hear the pleasant sounds, my child, without looking round to\r\nsee where they come from," replied Betty; "and as for the pretty sights,\r\nthough I can enjoy them as much as any one, I cannot neglect my work for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n15. "I promised your mother to have these shirts finished when she came\r\nhome, and I mean to do so."--"Dear me!" said the little girl, "I wish I\r\nhad brought my book, and I might have studied my lesson here."\r\n\r\n16. "No, no, Anna," said the old woman; "little girls can\'t study in the\r\nwoods, with the birds singing and the grasshoppers chirping around them.\r\nBetter attend to your books in-doors."\r\n\r\n17. Betty continued her sewing; and towards sunset, when they arose to\r\nreturn, she had stitched a collar and a pair of wristbands, while Anna\r\nhad filled her basket with flowers.\r\n\r\n18. As they approached the village, Betty called at a poor cottage, to\r\ninquire after a sick child, and Anna was shocked at the poverty and\r\nwretchedness of the inmates. The little children were only half clothed,\r\ntheir faces were covered with dirt, and their rough locks seemed to bid\r\ndefiance to the comb.\r\n\r\n19. Pitying the condition of the poor little girls, Anna determined to\r\nprovide them with some better clothing; and she returned home full of\r\nbenevolent projects.\r\n\r\n20. The next morning, as soon as she rose, she began to look over her\r\nwardrobe; and selecting three frocks which she had outgrown, she carried\r\nthem to Betty, to alter for Mrs. Wilson\'s children.\r\n\r\n21. "I shall do no such thing," said Betty; "Mrs. Wilson\'s children are\r\nnot suffering for clothes; the weather is warm, and they are as well\r\nclad as they will be the day after they are dressed up in your finery.\r\n\r\n22. "Mrs. Wilson is an untidy, slovenly woman; and though your mother\r\ncharged me to look after her sick baby, she did not tell me to furnish\r\nnew clothes for the other dirty little brats!"\r\n\r\n23. "Well, Betty, if you don\'t choose to do it, I\'ll try it\r\nmyself."--"Pretty work you\'ll make of it, to be sure! you will just cut\r\nthe frocks to pieces, and then they will fit nobody."\r\n\r\n24. "Well, I am determined to fix them for those poor little ragged\r\nchildren," said Anna; "and if you will not help me, I will get Kitty the\r\nchambermaid to do it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIX.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Anna found a very good assistant in the warm-hearted, thoughtless\r\nIrish girl. Kitty cut out the frocks, and Anna sat herself down to make\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n2. She found it rather tedious work, and, if she had not been afraid of\r\nBetty\'s ridicule, she would have been tempted to throw her task aside;\r\nbut as Kitty promised to help her, as soon as her household duties were\r\ncompleted, Anna determined to persevere.\r\n\r\n3. When night came, she had finished one frock, and begun another; so\r\nshe went to bed quite happy, forgetting that, in her benevolent zeal,\r\nshe had neglected her studies and her music, as well as her mother\'s\r\nplants and her own Canary-bird.\r\n\r\n4. The next day, she again went to work at the frocks, and, with Kitty\'s\r\nassistance, they were completed before tea-time. Never was a child\r\nhappier than Anna, when she saw the three little frocks spread out upon\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\n5. A degree of self-satisfaction was mingled with her benevolence, and\r\nshe began to think how pleased her mother would be to learn how hard she\r\nhad worked in the cause of charity. She ran off for Betty to take her\r\ndown to Mrs. Wilson\'s cottage; but she found Betty in no humor to\r\ngratify her.\r\n\r\n6. "I\'ll have nothing to do with it!" said the old woman. "Kitty helped\r\nyou to spoil your pretty frocks, and she may help you dress the dirty\r\nchildren;--they will look fine, to be sure, in your French calico\r\ndresses!"\r\n\r\n7. Anna was too happy to mind Betty\'s scolding; so away she flew to find\r\nKitty, and they set off together for Mrs. Wilson\'s cottage. When they\r\narrived there, they found the children by the edge of the pond making\r\ndirt pies, while their faces and hands bore testimony to their industry.\r\n\r\n8. Kitty stripped and washed them, though nothing but the bribe of a new\r\nfrock could have induced them to submit to so unusual an operation. Anna\r\nalmost danced with pleasure, when she beheld their clean faces,\r\nwell-combed locks, and new dresses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n9. Her mother had now been three days gone, and Anna felt that she had\r\nnot quite fulfilled her trust. But she satisfied herself with the\r\nthought that two days had been devoted to a charitable purpose, and she\r\nwas sure her mother would think that she had made good use of that\r\nportion of her time.\r\n\r\n10. The fourth day, she determined to make amends for past neglect, by\r\nstudying double lessons. She went to her room and locked the door,\r\nresolving to perform all her duties on that day, at least.\r\n\r\n11. She had scarcely commenced her studies, however, when she\r\nrecollected that she had not watered her mother\'s plants since she had\r\nbeen gone. She threw down her books, and running into the garden, sought\r\nher little watering-pot; but it was not to be found.\r\n\r\n12. She was sure she had put it either in the summer-house, or the\r\ntool-house, or under the piazza, or somewhere. After spending half an\r\nhour in search of it, she remembered that she had left it under the\r\ngreat elm-tree, in the field.\r\n\r\n13. By this time, the sun was shining with full vigor upon the delicate\r\nplants; and, forgetting her mother\'s caution to water them only in the\r\nshade, she overwhelmed the parched leaves with a deluge of water, and\r\nwent off quite content.\r\n\r\n14. She then thought of her bird; and on examining his cage, found that\r\nhe could reach neither the seed nor the water. So she replenished his\r\ncups, decorated his cage with fresh chickweed, treated him to a lump of\r\nsugar, and played with him until she had loitered away the best part of\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n15. Immediately after dinner, a little friend came to see her, and the\r\nrest of the day was consumed in dressing dolls, or arranging her\r\nbaby-house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXX.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, concluded._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. On the fifth day, she summoned courage enough to persevere, and\r\nactually performed every task with attention.\r\n\r\n2. In the afternoon, Betty took her out to walk, and Anna coaxed her\r\ninto a visit to Mrs. Wilson\'s cottage. What was her indignation, as she\r\napproached the house, to see the children again playing on the margin of\r\nthe duck-pond!\r\n\r\n3. As soon as they saw her, they ran to hide themselves, but not until\r\nshe had observed that their new frocks were as dirty, and almost as\r\nragged, as the old ones. Betty did not fail to make Anna fully sensible\r\nof her own superior wisdom.\r\n\r\n4. "I told you so, child," said she; "I told you it was all nonsense to\r\ntry to dress up those dirty creatures; much good you have done, to be\r\nsure!" Anna almost cried with vexation, as she thought of all the time\r\nand labor she had wasted upon her benevolent task, and she walked home\r\nwith a heavy heart.\r\n\r\n5. The next morning, she had scarcely risen from the breakfast-table,\r\nwhen Kitty came to show her a beautiful little ship, which, her\r\nbrother, who was a sailor, had made for her, as a token of remembrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n6. Anna was delighted with it; nothing could be more beautiful than its\r\ngraceful form, its delicate rigging and snowy sails. She begged to have\r\nit set on her table, that she might see it while she was studying, and\r\nthe good-natured Kitty left it with her.\r\n\r\n7. But in vain the heedless child tried to study; her eyes and thoughts\r\nwandered perpetually to the pretty toy before her. "How I should like to\r\nsee it sail!" said she to herself. The more she looked at it, the more\r\nanxious she became to see it in the water.\r\n\r\n8. At length, taking it carefully up, she stole down stairs, and hurried\r\nacross the garden to a little brook in the adjacent field. Here she\r\nlaunched her tiny bark; but it had scarcely touched the water, when it\r\nturned over on its side. She then recollected that she had once heard\r\nher father speak of the manner of ballasting a ship; so she hastened to\r\ngather a quantity of small stones, with which she filled the little\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\n9. Again she intrusted her ship to the crystal streamlet; but, alas! the\r\nweight of the stones carried it straight to the bottom. There it lay in\r\nthe pebbly channel, with the clear waters rippling above it, and the\r\nlittle girl stood aghast upon the brink.\r\n\r\n10. She bared her arm, and attempted to reach it, but without success.\r\nAt length, while making a desperate effort to regain it, she lost her\r\nbalance, and fell into the water.\r\n\r\n11. Fortunately, the water was not deep, and she soon scrambled out\r\nagain; but she was thoroughly wet, and, having been very warm before the\r\naccident, she was now chilled to the heart.\r\n\r\n12. Grasping the little ship, the cause of all the mischief, she hurried\r\nhome, and creeping softly into the kitchen, sought her friend Kitty, to\r\nscreen her from Betty\'s anger. By this time she was shivering with a\r\nviolent ague, and Kitty carried her immediately to Betty.\r\n\r\n13. Poor Anna! she was now obliged to be put to bed, and to take some\r\nof Betty\'s bitter herb tea, seasoned too with scolding, and all kinds of\r\nevil predictions. She felt very unhappy, and cried sadly; but\r\nrepentance, in this case, came too late.\r\n\r\n14. Her head began to ache dreadfully; her skin was parched with fever,\r\nand before the next morning she was very ill. She had taken a violent\r\ncold, which brought on an attack of scarlet fever; and when Mrs. Elmore\r\nreturned, she found her little daughter stretched on a bed of sickness.\r\n\r\n15. How did that fond mother tremble, as she watched by the bedside of\r\nher darling child, uncertain whether she would ever again lift up her\r\nhead from her uneasy pillow!\r\n\r\n16. Anna did not know her mother in the delirium of fever, and her\r\nmelancholy cry of "Mother! mother! come back!--I will never be so bad\r\nagain!" wrung Mrs. Elmore\'s heart.\r\n\r\n17. For three weeks Anna lay between life and death; and when she was at\r\nlength pronounced out of danger, she was as helpless as an infant.\r\n\r\n18. One day, as she sat propped up by pillows, she told her mother all\r\nthat had passed during her absence, and awaited her decision respecting\r\nthe use she had made of her time.\r\n\r\n19. "My dear child," said Mrs. Elinore, "I trust the past will afford a\r\nlesson you will never forget. So far from having made good use of your\r\ntime, you have done harm in everything you have undertaken.\r\n\r\n20. "Your attempts at study, instead of affording you any real\r\ninstruction, have only given you habits of inattention, which you will\r\nfind very difficult to overcome; for your eyes have wandered over the\r\npage, while your thoughts have been with the fool\'s, to the ends of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n21. "Your irregular care of my plants, which you thought would serve\r\ninstead of habitual attention, has been the means of destroying them as\r\neffectually as if you had allowed them to perish from total neglect.\r\n\r\n22. "Your injudicious benevolence to the Wilsons served only to make the\r\nchildren envious of each other, without giving them habits of neatness,\r\nwhich are essential to the well-being of such a family; while it had a\r\nworse effect upon yourself, because it not only wasted your precious\r\ntime, but excited in you a feeling of vanity, on account of what you\r\nconsidered a good action.\r\n\r\n23. "If, instead of trusting so boldly to your good resolutions, you had\r\nentered upon your duties with an humble mind, and resolved to _try_ to\r\ndo right,--if you had apportioned your time with some degree of\r\nregularity,--you might have performed all that was required of you,\r\nenjoyed all your amusements, and gratified every kindly feeling, without\r\na single self-reproach.\r\n\r\n24. "As it is, you feel sensible of having failed in everything,--of\r\nhaving exposed yourself to great peril, and subjected your mother to\r\ngreat anxiety, simply from your disposition to loiter, when you should\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n25. "I trust that, in the solitude of your sick chamber, \'the still\r\nsmall voice\' of your many wasted hours has made itself heard, and that\r\nhereafter you will not so utterly fail to make good use of your time."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXI.\r\n\r\n_Verse, or Poetry._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. All the lessons in this book which you have thus far read have been\r\nin prose. I intend to give you some lessons in verse, or, as it is\r\nsometimes, but improperly called, poetry.\r\n\r\n2. There is a great deal of difference between verse and poetry; but as\r\nthis book is intended for those who are not quite old enough to\r\nunderstand all these differences, I shall not attempt at present to\r\npoint them out to you.\r\n\r\n3. But I wish you first to understand the difference, which you can see\r\nwith your eye, between prose and verse. The lines of verse often end in\r\nwhat are called _rhymes_. Thus, if one line ends with the word _found_,\r\nthe next line ends with a word which sounds very much like it, as\r\n_ground, round, bound, sound, hound, wound_.\r\n\r\n4. These are called _rhymes_. Here are a few such lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT OF TIME.\r\n\r\n    "Defer not till to-morrow to be wise;\r\n     To-morrow\'s sun to thee may never rise."\r\n\r\n\r\nBEST USE OF MONEY.\r\n\r\n    "When wealth to virtuous hands is given,\r\n     It blesses like the dew of Heaven;\r\n     Like Heaven, it hears the orphan\'s cries,\r\n     And wipes the tears from widow\'s eyes."\r\n\r\n5. Sometimes the rhymes occur in alternate lines; that is, two lines\r\ncome together which are not rhymes, and are followed by two lines to\r\nmake rhymes to both, as follows:\r\n\r\n    "Let the sweet work of prayer and praise\r\n       Employ our youngest breath;\r\n     Thus we\'re prepared for longer days,\r\n       Or fit for early death."\r\n\r\n6. There are some kinds of verses that do not rhyme. These are called\r\n_blank_ verse. Here is an example of blank verse:\r\n\r\n        "Mark well, my child, he said; this little stream\r\n    Shall teach thee charity. It is a source\r\n    I never knew to fail: directed thus\r\n    Be that soft stream, the fountain of thy heart.\r\n    For, oh! my much-loved child, I trust thy heart\r\n    Has those affections that shall bless thyself;\r\n    And, flowing softly like this little rill,\r\n    Cheer all that droop. The good man did not err."\r\n\r\n7. Now, there are several things that I wish you to notice in these\r\nlines. In the first place, if you will count the syllables, you will\r\nfind that there are exactly ten syllables in each line; and it is always\r\nthe case, that in verse it is necessary that there should be a certain\r\nnumber of syllables of a certain kind.\r\n\r\n8. What that number is, I cannot now explain to you; but you will be\r\nable to understand from a book called a grammar, which you will probably\r\nstudy at some future time, if you do not study it now. It is contained\r\nin that part of grammar called Prosody.\r\n\r\n9. The next thing I wish you to notice is, that every line of verse\r\nalways begins with a capital letter.\r\n\r\n10. And thirdly you will notice, that the lines of verse are more\r\nregular in their sound than lines of prose. They have a kind of musical\r\nsound about them, which you very rarely hear, except in verse.\r\n\r\n11. And fourthly you will notice, that some of the words are shortened\r\nby leaving out a letter, and putting in its place a mark called an\r\n_apostrophe_, which looks just like a comma, only it is placed higher up\r\nin the line, as in the following line:\r\n\r\n    "Thus we\'re prepared for longer days."\r\n\r\n12. In this line, if the words were written out at full length, with all\r\ntheir letters in them, the line would stand as follows:\r\n\r\n    "Thus we are prepared for longer days."\r\n\r\n13. But this would destroy what is called the _measure_ of the line, by\r\nputting too many syllables into it; and therefore the words _we are_ are\r\nshortened, so as to be read as one syllable, and the line is to be read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    "Thus weer prepared for longer days."\r\n\r\n14. The next difference I shall point out to you between prose and\r\nverse, is that in verse the words are placed in a different order from\r\nwhat they would be in prose; as you will notice in the following lines:\r\n\r\n    "When all thy mercies, oh my God!\r\n       My rising soul surveys,\r\n     Transported with the view, I\'m lost\r\n       In wonder, love and praise."\r\n\r\n15. Now, if these lines were written in prose, the words would stand in\r\nthe following order: "O my God! when my rising soul surveys all thy\r\nmercies, I\'m transported with the view of them, and lost in wonder, love\r\nand praise."\r\n\r\n16. And now that I have explained to you a few of the points in which\r\nverse differs from prose, I will only add, that when you read verse, you\r\nmust not stop at the end of every line, unless there is a pause or mark\r\nthere; and that you must avoid reading it as if you were singing it to a\r\ntune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXII.\r\n\r\n_God Present Everywhere._\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Thou, Lord, by strictest search hast known\r\n    My rising up and lying down;\r\n    My secret thoughts are known to thee,\r\n    Known long before conceived by me.\r\n\r\n    2. Surrounded by thy power I stand,\r\n    On every side I find thy hand:\r\n    O skill for human reach too high!\r\n    Too dazzling bright for mortal eye!\r\n\r\n    3. From thy all-seeing Spirit, Lord,\r\n    What hiding-place does earth afford?\r\n    O where can I thy influence shun,\r\n    Or whither from thy presence run?\r\n\r\n    4. If up to heaven I take my flight,\r\n    \'Tis there thou dwell\'st enthroned in light;\r\n    If to the world unseen, my God,\r\n    There also hast thou thine abode.\r\n\r\n    5. If I the morning\'s wings could gain,\r\n    And fly beyond the western main;\r\n    E\'en there, in earth\'s remotest land,\r\n    I still should find thy guiding hand.\r\n\r\n    6. Or, should I try to shun thy sight\r\n    Beneath the sable wings of night;\r\n    One glance from thee, one piercing ray,\r\n    Would kindle darkness into day.\r\n\r\n    7. The veil of night is no disguise,\r\n    No screen from thy all-searching eyes;\r\n    Through midnight shades thou find\'st thy way,\r\n    As in the blazing noon, of day.\r\n\r\n    8. Thou know\'st the texture of my heart,\r\n    My reins, and every vital part:\r\n    I\'ll praise thee, from whose hands I came\r\n    A work of such a wondrous frame.\r\n\r\n    9. Let me acknowledge too, O God,\r\n    That since this maze of life I trod,\r\n    Thy thoughts of love to me surmount\r\n    The power of numbers to recount.\r\n\r\n    10. Search, try, O God, my thoughts and heart,\r\n    If mischief lurk in any part;\r\n    Correct me where I go astray,\r\n    And guide me in thy perfect way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIII.\r\n\r\n_Devotion._\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. While thee I seek, protecting Power,\r\n    Be my vain wishes stilled;\r\n    And may this consecrated hour\r\n    With better hopes be filled.\r\n\r\n    2. Thy love the power of thought stowed,\r\n    To thee my thoughts would soar:\r\n    Thy mercy o\'er my life has flowed,\r\n    That mercy I adore.\r\n\r\n    3. In each event of life, how clear\r\n    Thy ruling hand I see!\r\n    Each blessing to my soul more dear,\r\n    Because conferred by thee.\r\n\r\n    4. In every joy that crowns my days,\r\n    In every pain I bear,\r\n    My heart shall find delight in praise,\r\n    Or seek relief in prayer.\r\n\r\n    5. When gladness wings my favored hour,\r\n    Thy love my thoughts shall fill;\r\n    Resigned, when storms of sorrow lower,\r\n    My soul shall meet thy will.\r\n\r\n    6. My lifted eye, without a tear,\r\n    The gathering storm shall see;\r\n    My steadfast heart shall know no fear--\r\n    That heart will rest on thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIV.\r\n\r\n_The Gardener and the Hog._--GAY.\r\n\r\n    1. A gardener, of peculiar taste,\r\n    On a young hog his favor placed,\r\n    Who fed not with the common herd,--\r\n    His tray was to the hall preferred;\r\n    He wallowed underneath the board,\r\n    Or in his master\'s chamber snored,\r\n    Who fondly stroked him every day,\r\n    And taught him all the puppy\'s play.\r\n\r\n    2. Where\'er he went, the grunting friend\r\n    Ne\'er failed his pleasure to attend.\r\n    As on a time the loving pair\r\n    Walked forth to tend the garden\'s care,\r\n    The master thus addressed the swine:\r\n\r\n    3. "My house, my garden, all is thine:\r\n    On turnips feast whene\'er you please,\r\n    And riot in my beans and peas;\r\n    If the potato\'s taste delights,\r\n    Or the red carrot\'s sweet invites,\r\n    Indulge thy morn and evening hours,\r\n    But let due care regard my flowers;\r\n    My tulips are my garden\'s pride--\r\n    What vast expense these beds supplied!"\r\n\r\n    4. The hog, by chance, one morning roamed\r\n    Where with new ale the vessels foamed;\r\n    He munches now the steaming grains,\r\n    Now with full swill the liquor drains;\r\n    Intoxicating fumes arise,\r\n    He reels, he rolls his winking eyes;\r\n    Then, staggering, through the garden scours,\r\n    And treads down painted ranks of flowers;\r\n    With delving snout he turns the soil,\r\n    And cools his palate with the spoil.\r\n\r\n    5. The master came,--the ruin spied.\r\n    "Villain, suspend thy rage!" he cried:\r\n    "Hast then, thou most ungrateful sot,\r\n    My charge, my only charge, forgot?\r\n    What, all my flowers?" No more he said;\r\n    But gazed, and sighed, and hung his head.\r\n\r\n    6. The hog, with stuttering speech, returns:--\r\n    "Explain, sir, why your anger burns;\r\n    See there, untouched, your tulips strown,\r\n    For I devoured the roots alone!"\r\n\r\n    7. At this the gardener\'s passion grows;\r\n    From oaths and threats he fell to blows;\r\n    The stubborn brute the blows sustains,\r\n    Assaults his leg, and tears the veins.\r\n    Ah! foolish swain, too late you find\r\n    That sties were for such friends designed!\r\n\r\n    8. Homeward he limps with painful pace,\r\n    Reflecting thus on past disgrace:\r\n    Who cherishes a brutal mate,\r\n    Shall mourn the folly soon or late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXV.\r\n\r\n_The Hare and many Friends._--GAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. A hare, who, in a civil way,\r\n    Complied with everything, like Gay,\r\n    Was known by all the bestial train\r\n    Who haunt the wood, or graze the plain.\r\n    Her care was never to offend,\r\n    And every creature was her friend.\r\n\r\n    2. As forth she went, at early dawn,\r\n    To taste the dew-besprinkled lawn,\r\n    Behind she hears the hunter\'s cries,\r\n    And from the deep-mouthed thunder flies.\r\n\r\n    3. She starts, she stops, she pants for breath;\r\n    She hears the near advance of death;\r\n    She doubles to mislead the hound,\r\n    And measures back her mazy round;\r\n    Till, fainting in the public way,\r\n    Half dead with fear, she gasping lay.\r\n\r\n    4. What transport in her bosom grew,\r\n    When first the horse appeared in view!\r\n    "Let me," says she, "your back ascend,\r\n    And owe my safety to a friend.\r\n    You know my feet betray my flight,--\r\n    To friendship every burden\'s light."\r\n\r\n    5. The horse replied:--"Poor honest puss,\r\n    It grieves my heart to see thee thus.\r\n    Be comforted,--relief is near;\r\n    For all your friends are in the rear."\r\n\r\n    6. She next the stately bull implored;\r\n    And thus replied the mighty lord:--\r\n    "Since every beast alive can tell\r\n    That I sincerely wish you well,\r\n    I may, without offense, pretend\r\n    To take the freedom of a friend.\r\n    Love calls me hence; a favorite cow\r\n    Expects me near yon barley-mow;\r\n    And when a lady\'s in the case,\r\n    You know all other things give place.\r\n    To leave you thus might seem unkind;\r\n    But see,--the goat is just behind."\r\n\r\n    7. The goat remarked her pulse was high,\r\n    Her languid head, her heavy eye,--\r\n    "My back," says he, "may do you harm;\r\n    The sheep\'s at hand, and wool is warm."\r\n\r\n    8. The sheep was feeble, and complained\r\n    His sides a load of wool sustained:\r\n    Said he was slow, confessed his fears;\r\n    For hounds eat sheep, as well as hares.\r\n\r\n    9. She now the trotting calf addressed,\r\n    To save from death a friend distressed.\r\n    "Shall I," says he, "of tender age,\r\n    In this important care engage?\r\n    Older and abler passed you by;\r\n    How strong are those! how weak am I!\r\n\r\n    10. "Should I presume to bear you hence,\r\n    Those friends of mine may take offense.\r\n    Excuse me, then,--you know my heart;\r\n    But dearest friends, alas! must part.\r\n    How shall we all lament! Adieu!\r\n    For see,--the hounds are just in view."\r\n\r\n    11. \'Tis thus in friendships; who depend\r\n    On many, rarely find a friend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVI.\r\n\r\n_Maxims._--SELECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever delay until to-morrow what you can do to-day.\r\n\r\nNever trouble others for what you can do yourself.\r\n\r\nNever spend your money before you have it.\r\n\r\nNever buy what you do not want, because it is cheap.\r\n\r\nPride costs more than hunger, thirst, or cold.\r\n\r\nWe never repent of having eaten too little.\r\n\r\nNothing is troublesome that we do willingly.\r\n\r\nHow much pains have those evils cost us which never happened!\r\n\r\nTake things always by their smooth handle.\r\n\r\nWhen angry, count ten before you speak; if very angry, a hundred.\r\n\r\nHear as little as possible spoken against others; and believe nothing of\r\nthe kind, until you are absolutely forced to believe it.\r\n\r\nAlways believe that if you heard what may be said on the other side of\r\nthe question, a very different account of the matter might be given.\r\n\r\nDo to others what you would have them do to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVII.\r\n\r\n_How to be Happy._--CHILD AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Every child must have observed how much happier and more beloved some\r\nchildren are than others. There are some children whom you always love\r\nto be with. They are happy themselves, and they make you happy.\r\n\r\n2. There are others, whose society you always avoid. The very expression\r\nof their countenances produces unpleasant feelings. They seem to have no\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n3. No person can be happy without friends. The heart is formed for love,\r\nand cannot be happy without the opportunity of giving and receiving\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n4. But you cannot receive affection, unless you will also give it. You\r\ncannot find others to love you, unless you will also love them. Love is\r\nonly to be obtained by giving love in return. Hence the importance of\r\ncultivating a cheerful and obliging disposition. You cannot be happy\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\n5. I have sometimes heard a girl say, "I know that I am very unpopular\r\nat school." Now, this is a plain confession that she is very disobliging\r\nand unamiable in her disposition.\r\n\r\n6. If your companions do not love you, it is your own fault. They cannot\r\nhelp loving you, if you will be kind and friendly. If you are not loved,\r\nit is a good evidence that you do not deserve to be loved. It is true,\r\nthat a sense of duty may, at times, render it necessary for you to do\r\nthat which will be displeasing to your companions.\r\n\r\n7. But, if it is seen that you have a noble spirit, that you are above\r\nselfishness, that you are willing to make sacrifices of your own\r\npersonal convenience to promote the happiness of your associates, you\r\nwill never be in want of friends.\r\n\r\n8. You must not regard it as your _misfortune_ that others do not love\r\nyou, but your _fault_. It is not beauty, it is not wealth, that will\r\ngive you friends. Your heart must glow with kindness, if you would\r\nattract to yourself the esteem and affection of those by whom you are\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\n9. You are little aware how much the happiness of your whole life\r\ndepends upon the cultivation of an affectionate and obliging\r\ndisposition. If you will adopt the resolution that you will confer\r\nfavors whenever you have an opportunity, you will certainly be\r\nsurrounded by ardent friends.\r\n\r\n10. Begin upon this principle in childhood, and act upon it through\r\nlife, and you will make yourself happy, and promote the happiness of all\r\nwithin your influence.\r\n\r\n11. You go to school on a cold winter morning. A bright fire is blazing\r\nupon the hearth, surrounded with boys struggling to get near it to warm\r\nthemselves. After you get slightly warmed, another school-mate comes in,\r\nsuffering with cold. "Here, James," you pleasantly call out to him, "I\r\nam almost warm; you may have my place."\r\n\r\n12. As you slip aside to allow him to take your place at the fire, will\r\nhe not feel that you are kind? The worst dispositioned boy in the world\r\ncannot help admiring such generosity.\r\n\r\n13. And even though he be so ungrateful as to be unwilling to return the\r\nfavor, you may depend upon it that he will be your friend as far as he\r\nis capable of friendship. If you will habitually act upon this\r\nprinciple, you will never want friends.\r\n\r\n14. Suppose, some day, you were out with your companions, playing ball.\r\nAfter you had been playing for some time, another boy comes along. He\r\ncannot be chosen upon either side, for there is no one to match him.\r\n"Henry," you say, "you may take my place a little while, and I will\r\nrest."\r\n\r\n15. You throw yourself down upon the grass, while Henry, fresh and\r\nvigorous, takes your bat and engages in the game. He knows that you gave\r\nup to accommodate him; and how can he help liking you for it?\r\n\r\n16. The fact is, that neither man nor child can cultivate such a spirit\r\nof generosity and kindness, without attracting affection and esteem.\r\n\r\n17. Look and see which of your companions have the most friends, and you\r\nwill find that they are those who have this noble spirit,--who are\r\nwilling to deny themselves, that they may make their associates happy.\r\n\r\n18. This is not peculiar to childhood. It is the same in all periods of\r\nlife. There is but one way to make friends; and that is, by being\r\nfriendly to others.\r\n\r\n19. Perhaps some child, who reads this, feels conscious of being\r\ndisliked, and yet desires to have the affection of his companions. You\r\nask me what you shall do. I will tell you.\r\n\r\n20. I will give you an infallible rule. Do all in your power to make\r\nothers happy. Be willing to make sacrifices of your own convenience,\r\nthat you may promote the happiness of others.\r\n\r\n21. This is the way to make friends, and the only way. When you are\r\nplaying with your brothers and sisters at home, be always ready to give\r\nthem more than their share of privileges.\r\n\r\n22. Manifest an obliging disposition, and they cannot but regard you\r\nwith affection. In all your intercourse with others, at home or abroad,\r\nlet these feelings influence you, and you will receive a rich reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n_Obedience and Disobedience._--CHILD\'S COMPANION.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. You have never disobeyed your parents, or your teachers, or any who\r\nhave been placed in authority over you, without being uncomfortable and\r\nunhappy! Obedience, in a child, is one of the most necessary qualities;\r\nfor it protects him from all the evils of his want of experience, and\r\ngives him the benefit of the experience of others.\r\n\r\n2. One fine summer\'s day, I went to spend an afternoon at a house in\r\nthe country, where some young people were enjoying a holiday.\r\n\r\n3. They were running cheerfully up and down a meadow, covered over with\r\nyellow crocuses, and other flowers; and I looked on them with delight,\r\nwhile they gamboled and made posies, as they felt disposed.\r\n\r\n    "Here sister with sister roamed over the mead,\r\n       And brother plucked flow\'rets with brother;\r\n     And playmates with playmates ran on with such speed\r\n       That the one tumbled over the other."\r\n\r\n4. Now, they all had been told to keep away from the ditch at the bottom\r\nof the field; but, notwithstanding this injunction, one little urchin,\r\nof the name of Jarvis, seeing a flower in the hedge on the opposite\r\nbank, which he wished to gather, crept nearer and nearer to the ditch.\r\n\r\n5. The closer he got to the flower, the more beautiful it appeared to\r\nbe, and the stronger the temptation became to pluck it.\r\n\r\n6. Now, what right had he to put himself in the way of temptation? The\r\nfield, as I said before, was covered over with flowers; and that in the\r\nhedge was no better than the rest, only it was a forbidden flower, and\r\nwhen anything is forbidden it becomes, on that very account, a greater\r\ntemptation to a disobedient heart.\r\n\r\n7. Jarvis had gathered a whole handful of flowers before he saw the one\r\ngrowing in the hedge; but he threw all these away, so much was his mind\r\nset on getting the one which he wanted.\r\n\r\n8. Unluckily for him, in getting down the bank, his foot slipped, and\r\ndown he rolled into a bed of stinging nettles, at the bottom of the\r\nditch, which fortunately happened to have in it but little water.\r\n\r\n9. Jarvis screamed out with might and main, as he lay on his back; for,\r\nwhichever way he turned, his cheeks and his fingers brushed against the\r\nnettles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n10. His cries soon brought his companions around him; but, as they were\r\nall young, they knew not how to render him assistance, on account of\r\nthe stinging nettles, and the depth of the ditch.\r\n\r\n11. I ran to the spot, and pulled up Master Jarvis in a pretty pickle,\r\nhis jacket and trowsers plastered with mud, and his hands and face\r\ncovered with blotches.\r\n\r\n12. Here was the fruit of disobedience! And as it was with Jarvis, so\r\nwill it be with every one who acts disobediently.\r\n\r\n13. Whenever you feel a temptation to disobey God; to disobey his holy\r\nword; to disobey the admonitions of your own conscience; to disobey your\r\nparents, your teachers, or any in authority over you,--be sure that a\r\npunishment awaits you, if you do not resist it.\r\n\r\n14. As you are not able to resist it in your own strength, ask God\'s\r\nassistance for Christ\'s sake, and it will not be withheld. Now, remember\r\nJarvis, and the bed of stinging nettles!\r\n\r\n15. The Bible tells us very plainly how much God sets his face against\r\ndisobedience. "The children of Israel walked forty years in the\r\nwilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of\r\nEgypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord."\r\n\r\n16. "Let no man deceive you with vain words: for, because of these\r\nthings cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience." Nor\r\nis it disobedience to God that is alone hateful in his sight; for\r\ndisobedience to parents is spoken of as an evil thing, too.\r\n\r\n17. "The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his\r\nmother, the ravens of the valley shall pluck it out, and the young\r\neagles shall eat it."\r\n\r\n18. But I cannot bear to think that you are disobedient! I would rather\r\nconsider you obedient in all things, and encourage you in holding on\r\nyour way, obeying the will of God, and the word of all in authority over\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n    "The Lord rules over sea and land,\r\n       And blest indeed are they\r\n     Who all his counsels understand,\r\n       And his commands obey."\r\n\r\n19. I have often been struck with the simplicity with which some\r\nchildren obey their parents. This tractable disposition is very amiable\r\nin a child.\r\n\r\n20. It was no longer ago than last week, that, in crossing a field, I\r\novertook three children: one, a little girl of about five years old, was\r\non the foot-path, and, just as I came up, her brother called her to him,\r\nwhere he was in the field.\r\n\r\n21. "No, William," said the little maid; "my mother told me not to go\r\noff the foot-path, and it would be very wicked to disobey my mother."\r\n\r\n22. I caught the little creature up in my arms; and having a small neat\r\nbook in my pocket, suitable for a child, I gave it to her, and told her\r\nto remember that the reason why I gave it was, that she had been\r\nobedient to her mother.\r\n\r\n    "Though cares on cares in parent hearts be piled,\r\n     Great is that blessing--an obedient child!"\r\n\r\n23. Without obedience there can be no order. The man must obey his\r\nmaster, the maid her mistress, and the scholar his teacher. If you\r\nattend a Sunday-school, whatever class you are in, be obedient to your\r\ninstructors, or you will make but little progress. By obedience you will\r\nlearn faster, secure the respect of those about you, and set a proper\r\nexample to those younger than yourself.\r\n\r\n24. If you are in a place of work, be obedient to your employer. Those\r\nmake the best masters and mistresses who have been the most obedient\r\nservants; for the discharge of one duty disposes us to perform another.\r\n\r\n25. The best way to qualify yourselves to act well when grown up, is to\r\nact well while you are children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIX.\r\n\r\n_Obstinacy._--LESSONS WITHOUT BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. There is a certain fault which almost all children have in a greater\r\nor less degree. It is called by different names; sometimes it is termed\r\nwilfulness, sometimes pertinacity, and sometimes it receives the still\r\nharsher name of obstinacy.\r\n\r\n2. Almost all our faults are owing to the perversion or abuse of\r\npropensities originally good; and perseverance, when carried too far, or\r\nexpended upon unworthy objects, becomes a troublesome infirmity.\r\n\r\n3. Louisa and Emily had both something of this infirmity, but differing\r\nboth in degree and in its mode of operation.\r\n\r\n4. What are called _little things_ did not trouble Emily at all; and, on\r\nthe contrary, they troubled Louisa very much.\r\n\r\n5. But, when anything did seem peculiarly desirable to Emily,--when she\r\nset her heart upon having her own way,--she carried her perseverance to\r\na degree which deserved to be called obstinacy.\r\n\r\n6. She could _give up_, as children term it, with less effort, and more\r\ngrace, than most others; but if anything determined her not to give up,\r\nshe was immovable.\r\n\r\n7. "You are almost always in the right," my daughter, her father once\r\nsaid to her, "and Heaven preserve you from error; for when you once fall\r\ninto it, you will be too apt to persevere."\r\n\r\n8. It happened, at one time, that she and Louisa were having some nice\r\nsun-bonnets made. Emily went for them at the time when they were to be\r\nfinished, and finding only one completed, immediately appropriated it to\r\nherself, because she was really in greater need of it than Louisa, who\r\nhad one that answered her purpose very well.\r\n\r\n9. Louisa resented this, because that, being the eldest, she considered\r\nherself as having the first right; but Emily could not be persuaded to\r\ngive up, although Louisa\'s equanimity was very much disturbed on that\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n10. If it had been proposed to her beforehand to let Louisa have the\r\nbonnet voluntarily, she would not have hesitated, for she was not\r\nselfish; but when Louisa claimed it as a right, she resisted.\r\n\r\n11. Her mother afterwards told her that she should always avoid\r\nirritating the peculiar humors of her companions. "You," said she,\r\n"would not have minded waiting for the other bonnet a day or two, but to\r\nLouisa it was quite a serious evil."\r\n\r\n12. And here let me remark upon the proneness which all children have to\r\nmagnify the importance of little things. A strife often arises among\r\nthem, about just nothing at all, from a mere spirit of competition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n13. One says, "This is my seat." Another, who would not else have\r\nthought of desiring that particular seat, immediately regards it in the\r\nlight of a prize, and exclaims, "No, I meant to have that seat; and I\r\nhad it just before you took it."\r\n\r\n14. Half a dozen claimants will appear directly, and perhaps get into a\r\nserious quarrel; whereas, had the reply been, in the first instance,\r\n"Very well, let it be your seat," there would have been an end to the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n15. But to return to Louisa. She magnified a thousand little things, of\r\nevery day occurrence, in such a manner as proved a very serious\r\ninconvenience to herself.\r\n\r\n16. She wished to have her potato sliced, but never mashed. She could\r\nnot bear to see a door open a single moment; and, even if she were at\r\nher meals, and the closet door happened to stand ajar, she would jump up\r\nand fly to shut it, with the speed of lightning.\r\n\r\n17. She could not _endure_ the feeling of gloves; nor could she any\r\nbetter endure to have her hat tied. Her aunt bore with all these follies\r\na while, and then deliberately resolved to counteract them.\r\n\r\n18. Louisa at first thought this was very hard and unreasonable. "Why\r\ncan\'t I have my potato sliced, Aunt Cleaveland?" said she; "what hurt\r\ncan it do? And why can\'t I shut the door when it is open? is there any\r\nharm in that?"\r\n\r\n19. "Not at all, my dear, in the thing itself," Mrs. Cleaveland replied;\r\n"but there is a great deal of evil in having your tranquillity disturbed\r\nby things of such small moment.\r\n\r\n20. "If you allow yourself to be distressed by trifles now, how will you\r\nbear the real trials of life, which you must inevitably sustain, sooner\r\nor later?\r\n\r\n21. "By and by, you will find out that your suffering from these sources\r\nis all imaginary, and then you will thank me for having restrained you.\r\n\r\n22. "Now, here is this nice dish of mashed potatoes, which we have every\r\nday. If such a little hungry girl as you are, since you have breathed\r\nour healthy mountain air, cannot eat it, and with relish too, I am\r\ngreatly mistaken; and, in process of time, I have no doubt you will\r\ncease to observe whether the door is open or shut."\r\n\r\n23. On the first day of trial, Louisa just tasted the potato, and left\r\nthe whole of it upon her plate. Her aunt took no notice of this. The\r\nnext day, Louisa came in to dinner after a long walk, and was very\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\n24. There was but one dish of meat upon the table, and it was of a kind\r\nwhich she did not much like; so, forgetting all her repugnance to mashed\r\npotato, she ate it very heartily.\r\n\r\n25. Mrs. Cleaveland, however, forbore to take any notice of this change;\r\nand it was not until after several weeks had elapsed, and Louisa had\r\nceased to think of the distinction between sliced potato and mashed\r\npotato, that her aunt reminded her of the importance which she had\r\nformerly attached to the former.\r\n\r\n26. "Now, my dear Louisa," said Mrs. Cleaveland, "since you find the\r\ntask is not so very difficult as you apprehended, promise me that you\r\nwill try to cure yourself of all these little infirmities; for such I\r\nmust term them.\r\n\r\n27. "There is so much real suffering in life, that it is a pity to have\r\nany which is merely imaginary; and though, while you are a little girl,\r\nliving with indulgent friends, your whims might all be gratified, a\r\nconstant and uniform regard to them will be impossible by and by, when\r\nyou are old enough to mingle with the world."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XL.\r\n\r\n_King Edward and his Bible._--MRS. L.H. SIGOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I will tell you a little story about a young and good king. He was\r\nking of England more than two hundred and eighty years ago. His name was\r\nEdward, and, because there had been five kings before him of the name of\r\nEdward, he was called Edward the Sixth.\r\n\r\n2. He was only nine years old when he began to reign. He was early\r\ntaught to be good, by pious teachers, and he loved to do what they told\r\nhim would please God. He had a great reverence for the Bible, which he\r\nknew contained the words of his Father in heaven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n3. Once, when he was quite a young child, he was playing with some\r\nchildren about his own age. He wished much to reach something which was\r\nabove his head. To assist him, they laid a large, thick book in a chair,\r\nfor him to step on. Just as he was putting his foot upon it, he\r\ndiscovered it to be the Bible.\r\n\r\n4. Drawing back, he took it in his arms, kissed it, and returned it to\r\nits place. Turning to his little playmates, he said, with a serious\r\nface,--"Shall I dare to tread under my feet that which God has\r\ncommanded me to keep in my heart?"\r\n\r\n5. This pious king never forgot his prayers. Though the people with whom\r\nhe lived were continually anxious to amuse him, and show him some new\r\nthing, they never could induce him to omit his daily devotions.\r\n\r\n6. One day he heard that one of his teachers was sick. Immediately, he\r\nretired to pray for him. Coming from his prayers, he said, with a\r\ncheerful countenance, "I think there is hope that he will recover. I\r\nhave this morning earnestly begged of God to spare him to us."\r\n\r\n7. After his teacher became well, he was told of this; and he very much\r\nloved the young king for remembering him in his prayers.\r\n\r\n8. Edward the Sixth died when he was sixteen years old. He was beloved\r\nby all, for his goodness and piety. His mind was calm and serene in his\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\n9. If you are not tired of my story, I will tell you part of a prayer\r\nwhich he used often to say, when on his dying bed.\r\n\r\n10. "My Lord God, if thou wilt deliver me from this miserable life, take\r\nme among thy chosen. Yet not my will, but thy will, be done. Lord, I\r\ncommit my spirit unto thee. Thou knowest how happy it were for me to be\r\nwith thee. Yet, if thou shouldst send me life and health, grant that I\r\nmay truly serve thee."\r\n\r\n11. Children, you should do like King Edward, reverence your Bible, and\r\nlove to pray to God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLI.\r\n\r\n_What does it Mean to be Tempted._--M.H., IN THE ROSE-BUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. "Mother," said little Frank, "I wish you would tell me what it means\r\nto be tempted. I heard you say, the other day, that people are tempted\r\nto do many wicked things;--pray tell me, mother, if such a little boy as\r\nI am is ever tempted?"\r\n\r\n2. "Yes, my child, every day you live; and when I have told you what\r\ntemptation is, I think you will confess that you have not only been\r\ntempted, but often yielded to temptation.\r\n\r\n3. "To be tempted, means to be drawn by the offer of present pleasure to\r\ndo what is wrong. There are many kinds of temptation, and I think you\r\nwill understand me better if I give you an instance.\r\n\r\n4. "You know, my dear Frank, that both your father and I have forbidden\r\nyour going to the pond where your cousin Henry was drowned, because we\r\nthink it very dangerous for you to venture there. But you also know that\r\nthe other day you went, and suffered severely afterward for your\r\ndisobedience."\r\n\r\n5. "Yes, mother," said Frank; "but then I should not have gone, if\r\nWilliam Brown had not showed me his pretty ship, just as I was coming\r\nout of school, and asked me to go see him launch it; and oh, mother, if\r\nyou had only seen it!\r\n\r\n6. "It had masts and sails, just like a _real_ ship; and on the deck a\r\nlittle man, which William called the captain. And then, when it was on\r\nthe water, it sailed along so sweetly!--the pond was as smooth as a\r\nlooking-glass, so that we could see two little ships all the time.\r\n\r\n7. "I didn\'t think of disobeying you, mother; I only thought of the\r\npretty ship, and that there could be no harm in seeing William sail\r\nit."--"The harm, my dear son (as you call it)," said his mother, "was\r\nnot in sailing the boat,--this is an innocent pleasure in itself; but it\r\nwas doing it after it had been forbidden by your parents, that made it\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n8. "The temptation to disobedience came in the form of a little ship.\r\nYou were drawn by it to the pond, the forbidden spot. You saw it sail\r\ngayly off, and stood on the bank delighted."\r\n\r\n9. "But, mother," interrupted Frank, "I shouldn\'t have got into the\r\nwater and muddied my clothes, if the little ship hadn\'t got tangled in\r\nthe weeds; and the boys all shouted, Clear her! Clear her! and I\r\ncouldn\'t help stepping in, I was so near; and my foot slipped, and I\r\nfell in."\r\n\r\n10. "Yes," said his mother, "and but for assistance of your\r\nplay-fellows, you might have been drowned. But God, whose eye was upon\r\nyou all the while, saw fit to spare you; and how thankful you ought to\r\nbe that he did not take you away in your disobedience!\r\n\r\n11. "You now see how you were tempted, first to go with William Brown to\r\nthe pond, and then to step into the water; which shows how one\r\ntemptation leads to another. But did not something within you, my son,\r\ntell you, while there, that you were doing wrong to disobey your\r\nparents?"\r\n\r\n12. "No, mother; I do not recollect that it did. I\'m sure I did not\r\nthink a word about it till I was alone in bed, and was asking my\r\nheavenly Father to take care of me. Then something seemed to say,\r\n\'Frank, you have done wrong to-day.\'\r\n\r\n13. "And I felt how wicked I had been, and could not ask God to forgive\r\nme till I had confessed all to you. I knew you were away when I came\r\nhome, and I thought you hadn\'t returned.\r\n\r\n14. "I was so unhappy that I called Betsy, and told her how I felt. She\r\ntold me it was an accident, and no matter at all; that she had taken\r\ncare of my clothes, and she believed you would never know anything about\r\nit.\r\n\r\n15. "But all this was no comfort to me; the something within would not\r\nbe quiet. If it had spoken to me in the same way when I first saw the\r\nlittle ship, I think I should not have gone to the pond."\r\n\r\n16. "Frank," said his mother, "this something within, which is\r\nconscience, did then speak, but you did not listen to its voice. The\r\nvoice of temptation was louder, and you obeyed it, just as you followed\r\nsome noisy boys, the other day, though I was calling to you, \'Frank,\r\ncome back.\'\r\n\r\n17. "I spoke louder than usual, and at any other time you would have\r\nheard my voice; but you were too much attracted by the boys to listen to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n18. "Temptation makes us deaf to the voice within; and yielding to\r\ntemptation, as you see, my son, leads us into sin; and this is why we\r\npray, in the Lord\'s prayer, \'Lead us not into temptation, but deliver\r\nus from evil,\' which is sin, for there is no greater evil than sin.\r\n\r\n19. "It is to keep us from this great evil that God has given us this\r\nvoice within, to warn us not to follow temptation, though the sin appear\r\nbut a trifling one, and though it hold out the promise of pleasure, as\r\nthe little ship did."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLII.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. "I will name some of the temptations to which little boys are a good\r\ndeal exposed, and yield to without thinking, and sometimes without\r\nknowing to what they may lead.\r\n\r\n2. "Sometimes the temptation to steal comes in the form of some\r\nbeautiful fruit; perhaps in his father\'s garden, which he has been\r\nforbidden to touch; or perhaps in an orchard far from the eye of the\r\nowner, where he might take it without fear of being seen; and he says to\r\nhimself, \'No one will ever know it; I will take only a few.\'\r\n\r\n3. "But does he forget that the eye of God is upon him, and does he not\r\nhear the voice of conscience saying, \'Thou shalt not steal!\' He would\r\nshudder to be called a thief; but taking what does not belong to us, be\r\nit ever so small a thing, is stealing.\r\n\r\n4. "And when detected, he is tempted to lie, to conceal his fault and\r\navoid punishment; and here again we see how one sin leads to another.\r\nThe temptations to cruelty are many. Sometimes they appear in the form\r\nof a bird\'s nest, placed by a fond and loving mother on the high bough\r\nof a tree, to secure her young brood from danger.\r\n\r\n5. "The boy, in his rambles in the woods, sees the nest, climbs the\r\ntree, and, though the little birds are too feeble to fly, and the\r\nanxious mother flutters round, as if to entreat the cruel boy to spare\r\nher little ones, he is unmindful of her tenderness, and, thinking only\r\nof his prize, bears it off to his companions, who enjoy it with him.\r\n\r\n6. "Here is a sinful feeling indulged, which, if not subdued, may lead\r\nto murder. I wish you to remember, my dear boy, that it is by allowing\r\nourselves to commit little sins that we become great sinners.\r\n\r\n7. "You would be frightened if you could have placed before you a\r\npicture of the course of sin. You would exclaim, What a monster!--he\r\nmust never come near me,--it is dangerous even to look on him! Let me\r\nentreat you, then, my son, to guard against temptation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n8. "If you say to temptation, as you would to a wicked companion, who\r\nhad often led you into mischief, \'Go away; I do not like your company,\'\r\ntemptation, though for a while it may plead to be indulged, will soon do\r\nas the wicked companion would, if often sent away with such a reproof,\r\ndiscontinue to come; or, if found in your company, will not harm you;\r\nfor conscience, like a good friend, will be ever near; and your blessed\r\nSaviour, who has promised to help those who are tempted, will assist you\r\nto overcome temptation.\r\n\r\n9. "I hope now you understand what it means to be tempted."--"I think I\r\ndo, mother," said Frank, "and I thank you for telling me so much about\r\ntemptation. I shall never again repeat the Lord\'s prayer without\r\nthinking what it means, and I hope God will keep me from the great evil\r\nof sin." He then kissed his mother, and she promised to tell him, some\r\nother time, how we are tempted by sinful thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLIII.\r\n\r\n_The same, subject, continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. It was not long after Frank had the conversation with his mother upon\r\nthe temptation to sinful actions, that he claimed her promise to tell\r\nhim how we may be tempted to sinful thoughts.\r\n\r\n2. It was Sunday evening. Frank and his mother were sitting alone\r\ntogether at a window which opened upon a flower-garden, rich in the hues\r\nwith which God has seen fit to adorn this beautiful part of creation.\r\n\r\n3. "You have been at church to-day, my son," said his mother; "and to my\r\neye you did nothing offensive, for you sat still during the sermon, and\r\nappeared engaged with your book during the prayers.\r\n\r\n4. "I saw only the _outward_ part; but remember there was an eye of\r\ninfinite purity looking upon your heart, and seeing the thoughts that\r\nwere passing there. You only can tell if they were fit to meet that\r\neye."\r\n\r\n5. Frank looked down; for, like most children, he was not apt to examine\r\neither his thoughts or motives, but was well satisfied if he gained the\r\napprobation of his parents.\r\n\r\n6. His mother, seeing he was struggling to disclose something, said,\r\n"You are an honest boy, Frank, and do not, I trust, wish to conceal the\r\ntruth from your mother. If you have received my approbation for correct\r\nconduct, you certainly cannot enjoy it, if you feel that it is not\r\ndeserved."\r\n\r\n7. "That is what troubles me, mother," said Frank; "for, while I was\r\nsitting so still, and you thought I was attending to the sermon, I was\r\nall the while watching a pretty little dog, that was running from pew to\r\npew, trying to find his master; and when he got on the pulpit step, and\r\nrolled off, I came so near laughing that I was obliged to put my\r\nhandkerchief to my mouth, and make believe to cough.\r\n\r\n8. "I kept my eye upon him till church was done, and thought, if I could\r\nsee him at the door, I would try to make him follow me home, and keep\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n9. "I feel now, mother, that all this was very wrong, and that these\r\nnaughty thoughts tempted me to break God\'s holy Sabbath."\r\n\r\n10. "I am glad you feel this, my son; for, besides being sinful to\r\ndesire to have the little dog, which was coveting what belonged to\r\nanother, the time and place in which you indulged the thought was the\r\nbreaking of that commandment which says, \'Remember the Sabbath day, to\r\nkeep it holy.\'"\r\n\r\n11. "But, mother," asked Frank, impatiently, "how shall I keep these\r\nthoughts out? They come before I know it. Sometimes a boy has a new suit\r\nof clothes on, and I cannot help looking at him; and sometimes the\r\ngirls will play with their gloves, and tie and untie their bonnets; and\r\nsometimes the little children get to sleep, and I can\'t help watching\r\nthem, to see if they will not slip off the seat.\r\n\r\n12. "I think, mother, if we did not sit in the gallery, I shouldn\'t see\r\nso many things to tempt me to wicked thoughts in church."\r\n\r\n13. "If I really believed this myself, Frank, I should think it\r\nimportant to change our seat: but the mischief does not lie here; it is\r\nin your heart.\r\n\r\n14. "If this were right, and you really loved God and his service, the\r\nthought of his presence would keep out these troublesome intruders; not\r\naltogether, my son, for the best of people are sometimes subject to\r\nwandering thoughts; but it is a temptation which they overcome, by\r\nturning their attention immediately to the services, and by taking their\r\neyes from the object that drew away their thoughts from God."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLIV.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, concluded._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. "If some great king, who loved his people, and was continually giving\r\nthem some good things, should appoint a day when he would meet his\r\nsubjects, rich and poor, young and old, and should declare to them how\r\nthey may best please him; and a person should be appointed to read to\r\nthem, from a book he had himself written, directions for their conduct;\r\nand that, as a reward for obedience, should promise they should be\r\nadmitted to his palace, where nothing that could trouble them should\r\never be allowed to enter--"\r\n\r\n2. "Why, mother," exclaimed Frank, "I should so admire to see a king,\r\nthat I should be willing to do everything he required; and should be\r\nafraid, all the time, of doing something he did not like, while in his\r\npresence. I should keep looking at him all the time, to see if he were\r\npleased;--but go on, mother."\r\n\r\n3. "Well, my son, suppose this great person, who is also good, should\r\nkeep a book in which he noted down all your actions, and even looks;\r\nand, on a certain day which he had appointed, and which was known to\r\nhimself, should call together a great multitude of people, his friends\r\nand yours, and should read to them all that he had written there,--do\r\nyou think you would be careless or indifferent what was written against\r\nyour name?"\r\n\r\n4. "O no, mother! I should be so anxious that I should want to hide\r\nmyself, for fear something should be read that I should be ashamed\r\nof,--something very bad. But, mother, no king ever did this, that you\r\nknow of. If he did, pray tell me more about him; and if his subjects\r\nwere not all good and obedient."\r\n\r\n5. "I have heard of a king, my son, who has done more than this; but not\r\nan earthly king. Earthly kings are limited in their power; for they are\r\nbut men. But the king of whom I speak is the Lord of the whole earth."\r\n\r\n6. "Do you mean God, mother?"--"I do, my son. You have told me how you\r\nshould behave in the presence of an earthly king on the day he should\r\nappoint to meet his people; and would you treat with less reverence and\r\nrespect him who is the King of kings and Lord of lords?\r\n\r\n7. "Can you, on entering his house, say, \'The Lord is in his holy\r\ntemple,\' and feel no desire to meet him there; but allow any trifle that\r\nmeets your eye to carry your thoughts away? Do you, when his holy book\r\nis read, feel no desire to hear the directions he has given to lead you\r\nto your heavenly home?\r\n\r\n8. "And when the petitions are sent up imploring his blessings, and\r\nasking his forgiveness, have you none to offer? Are you so blest as to\r\nhave nothing to ask, and so good as to need no forgiveness?\r\n\r\n9. "O my son, be careful how you neglect these gracious privileges! And\r\nwhen his ministers, whom he has appointed to declare his will,--to\r\ninstruct you out of his word,--preach to you from the sacred pulpit,\r\nwill you turn a deaf ear, and lose their instructions, and at the same\r\ntime displease your heavenly Father?\r\n\r\n10. "This great and powerful king is also your father and friend. He\r\nloves you more than any earthly friend. He is willing to hear all your\r\npetitions, and is even more ready to give than we are to ask. He has\r\nappointed one day in seven in which to meet us, and this is the Sabbath,\r\nabout the keeping of which we are now talking.\r\n\r\n11. "And he has also appointed a day in which he will judge the world,\r\nfrom the book which he has kept of our accounts.\r\n\r\n12. "On that day there will be assembled a great multitude, which no man\r\ncan number, out of every kindred and tongue; great and small, good and\r\nbad. You and I will be there, my son.\r\n\r\n13. "There will be the minister and his people, the Sunday-school\r\nteacher and his scholars, all to receive either the sentence, \'Come, ye\r\nblessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the\r\nfoundation of the world,\' or, \'Depart from me, ye cursed, into\r\neverlasting punishment.\'"\r\n\r\n14. Frank was moved by this representation of the consequences of his\r\nneglect of the duties he owed his heavenly Father, and said, "O, how sad\r\nit would be, how dreadful, if, on that day I should be sent to dwell\r\nforever where God is not, and where you and father are not!"\r\n\r\n15. "Dreadful, indeed, my son, would be such a separation; and when you\r\nthink of this, let it make you more earnest to serve and please God; for\r\nJesus Christ, who came upon earth once to die for us all, and will come\r\nagain to judge the earth, has gone to prepare mansions in heaven for\r\nthose who love him, that they may dwell with him forever in perfect\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n16. "Let us now, my son, pray to our heavenly Father to prepare us for\r\nthis blessedness, that where he is, there we may be also." Frank and his\r\nmother knelt together, and offered up the following prayer:--\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAYER FOR GOOD THOUGHTS.\r\n\r\n17. Almighty and most merciful Father! teach us thy will, that we may\r\nknow how to please thee. Put good thoughts into our hearts, and right\r\nwords into our lips, that our services may be such as thou wilt please\r\nto accept.\r\n\r\n18. Forgive, we pray thee, the sins we have committed this day, in\r\nthought, word, or deed, and make us truly sorry on account of them. Help\r\nus to love thee more, and serve thee better, for the time to come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n19. Bless all our friends, and make them thy friends. Make us a\r\nhousehold serving thee, that after this life is over, we may all meet in\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n20. O then, great Shepherd, who neither slumberest nor sleepest, take us\r\nunder thy protection this night; and when the cheerful light of day\r\nagain returns, lead us forth in thy fold, and keep us from every\r\ntemptation that will draw us away from thee.\r\n\r\n21. May our peaceful slumbers remind us of the sleep of death; and, on\r\nthe morning of the resurrection, wilt thou clothe us in the\r\nrighteousness of Christ, and receive us to dwell with him in life\r\neverlasting! Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLV.\r\n\r\n_Mary Dow._--H.F. GOULD.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. "Come in, little stranger," I said,\r\n    As she tapped at my half-opened door,\r\n    While the blanket pinned over her head\r\n    Just reached to the basket she bore.\r\n\r\n    2. A look full of innocence fell\r\n    From her modest and pretty blue eye,\r\n    As she said, "I have matches to sell,\r\n    And hope you are willing to buy.\r\n\r\n    3. "A penny a bunch is the price;\r\n    I think you\'ll not find it too much;\r\n    They\'re tied up so even and nice,\r\n    And ready to light with a touch."\r\n\r\n    4. I asked, "What\'s your name, little girl?"\r\n    "\'Tis Mary," said she,--"Mary Dow,"\r\n    And carelessly tossed off a curl,\r\n    That played o\'er her delicate brow.\r\n\r\n    5. "My father was lost in the deep,--\r\n    The ship never got to the shore;\r\n    And mother is sad, and will weep,\r\n    When she hears the wind blow and sea roar.\r\n\r\n    6. "She sits there at home, without food,\r\n    Beside our poor sick Willie\'s bed;\r\n    She paid all her money for wood,\r\n    And so I sell matches for bread.\r\n\r\n    7. "For every time that she tries\r\n    Some things she\'d be paid for to make,\r\n    And lays down the baby, it cries,\r\n    And that makes my sick brother wake.\r\n\r\n    8. "I\'d go to the yard and get chips,\r\n    But, then, it would make me too sad,\r\n    To see men there building the ships,\r\n    And think they had made one so bad.\r\n\r\n    9. "I\'ve one other gown, and, with care,\r\n    We think it may decently pass,\r\n    With my bonnet that\'s put by to wear\r\n    To meeting and Sunday-school class.\r\n\r\n    10. "I love to go there, where I\'m taught,\r\n    Of One who\'s so wise and so good,\r\n    He knows every action and thought,\r\n    And gives e\'en the raven his food.\r\n\r\n    11. "For He, I am sure, who can take\r\n    Such fatherly care of a bird,\r\n    Will never forget or forsake\r\n    The children who trust to his word.\r\n\r\n    12. "And now, if I only can sell\r\n    The matches I brought out to-day,\r\n    I think I shall do very well,\r\n    And mother\'ll rejoice at the pay."\r\n\r\n    13. "Fly home, little bird," then I thought,\r\n    "Fly home, full of joy, to your nest!"\r\n    For I took all the matches she brought,\r\n    And Mary may tell you the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLVI.\r\n\r\n_It Snows._--H.F. GOULD.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. It snows! it snows! from out the sky,\r\n    The feathered flakes, how fast they fly!\r\n    Like little birds, that don\'t know why\r\n    They\'re on the chase, from place to place,\r\n    While neither can the other trace.\r\n    It snows! it snows! a merry play\r\n    Is o\'er us, on this heavy day!\r\n\r\n    2. As dancers in an airy hall,\r\n    That hasn\'t room to hold them all,\r\n    While some keep up and others fall,\r\n    The atoms shift; then, thick and swift,\r\n    They drive along to form the drift,\r\n    That, weaving up, so dazzling white,\r\n    Is rising like a wall of light.\r\n\r\n    3. But now the wind comes whistling loud,\r\n    To snatch and waft it, as a cloud,\r\n    Or giant phantom in a shroud;\r\n    It spreads, it curls, it mounts and whirls,\r\n    At length a mighty wing unfurls,\r\n    And then, away! but where, none knows,\r\n    Or ever will.--It snows! it snows!\r\n\r\n    4. To-morrow will the storm be done;\r\n    Then out will come the golden sun,\r\n    And we shall see, upon the run\r\n    Before his beams, in sparkling streams,\r\n    What now a curtain o\'er him seems.\r\n    And thus with life it ever goes,\r\n    \'Tis shade and shine!--It snows! it snows!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLVII.\r\n\r\n_The Dissatisfied Angler Boy._--H.F. GOULD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    1. I\'m sorry they let me go down to the brook,\r\n    I\'m sorry they gave me the line and the hook,\r\n    And I wish I had stayed at home with my book.\r\n    I\'m sure \'twas no pleasure to see\r\n    That poor, little, harmless, suffering thing,\r\n    Silently writhe at the end of the string;\r\n    Or to hold the pole, while I felt him swing\r\n    In torture, and all for me!\r\n\r\n    2. \'Twas a beautiful speckled and glossy trout,\r\n    And when from the water I drew him out\r\n    On the grassy bank, as he floundered about,\r\n    It made me shivering cold,\r\n    To think I had caused so much needless pain;\r\n    And I tried to relieve him, but all in vain;\r\n    O! never, as long as I live, again\r\n    May I such a sight behold!\r\n\r\n    3. O, what would I give once more to see\r\n    The brisk little swimmer alive and free,\r\n    And darting about, as he used to be,\r\n    Unhurt, in his native brook!\r\n    \'Tis strange how people can love to play,\r\n    By taking innocent lives away;\r\n    I wish I had stayed at home to-day,\r\n    With sister, and read my book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLVIII.\r\n\r\n_The Violet: a Fable._--CHILDREN\'S MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Down in a humble dell\r\n    A modest violet chanced to dwell\r\n    Remote from gayer flowers;\r\n    Its days were passed in simple ease,\r\n    It sipped the dew and kissed the breeze,\r\n    Nor thought of happier hours.\r\n\r\n    2. Long lived it in this quiet way,\r\n    Till, on a hot and sultry day\r\n    About the midst of June,\r\n    It chanced to spy a lady fair,\r\n    All dressed in satins rich and rare,\r\n    Come walking by, at noon.\r\n\r\n    3. And thus the silly flower began:--\r\n    "I much should like to live with man,\r\n    And other flowers to see;--\r\n    Why is it (for I cannot tell)\r\n    That I forever here should dwell,\r\n    Where there is none but me?"\r\n\r\n    4. While thus it spoke, the lady stopped\r\n    To pick up something she had dropped,\r\n    And there the flower she spied;\r\n    And soon she plucked it from its bed,\r\n    Just shook the dew-drop from its head,\r\n    And placed it at her side.\r\n\r\n    5. Soon at the lady\'s splendid home\r\n    The violet found that she was come,\r\n    For all was bright and gay:\r\n    And then upon the mantel-shelf,\r\n    With many a flower beside herself,\r\n    Was placed, without delay.\r\n\r\n    6. And oh, how glad and proud was she\r\n    In such a splendid place to be!--\r\n    But short was her delight;\r\n    For rose and lily turned away,\r\n    And would not deign a word to say\r\n    To such a country wight.\r\n\r\n    7. She passed the day in much disgrace,\r\n    And wished that she might change her place,\r\n    And be at home again:\r\n    She sighed for her own mossy bed,\r\n    Where she might rest her aching head;\r\n    But now to wish were vain.\r\n\r\n    8. Next morn, the housemaid, passing by,\r\n    Just chanced the little flower to spy,\r\n    And then, without delay,\r\n    She rudely seized its tender stalk,\r\n    And threw it in the gravel walk,\r\n    And left it to decay.\r\n\r\n    9. And thus it mourned,--"O silly flower,\r\n    To wish to leave its native bower!\r\n    Was it for this I sighed?\r\n    O, had I more contented been,\r\n    And lived unnoticed and unseen,\r\n    I might not thus have died!"\r\n\r\n    10. Nor let this lesson be forgot:\r\n    Remain contented with the lot\r\n    That Providence decrees.\r\n    Contentment is a richer gem\r\n    Than sparkles in a diadem,\r\n    And gives us greater ease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLIX.\r\n\r\n_Captain John Smith._--JUVENILE MISCELLANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The adventures of this singular man are so various, and so very\r\nextraordinary, that the detail of them seems more like romance than true\r\nhistory. He was born in Lincolnshire, England, and was left an orphan at\r\nan early age.\r\n\r\n2. His love of adventure displayed itself while he was yet a school-boy.\r\nHe sold his satchel, books and clothes, and went over to France, without\r\nthe knowledge of his guardians.\r\n\r\n3. Afterward, he served as a soldier in the Netherlands for several\r\nyears. At the end of his campaign, he returned to England, where he\r\nrecovered a small portion of the estate left him by his deceased father.\r\n\r\n4. This money enabled him to resume his travels under more favorable\r\nauspices, at the age of seventeen. He again went to France, and embarked\r\nat Marseilles (_pronounced_ Mar-sales\xc2\xb4), with some pious pilgrims,\r\nbound to Italy.\r\n\r\n5. During this voyage a violent tempest threatened destruction to the\r\nvessel; and poor Smith being the suspected cause of the impending danger\r\nwas thrown, without mercy, into the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n6. He saved himself by his great expertness in swimming; and soon after\r\nwent on board another vessel, bound to Alexandria, where he entered into\r\nthe service of the Emperor of Austria, against the Turks.\r\n\r\n7. His bravery, and great ingenuity in all the stratagems of war, soon\r\nmade him famous, and obtained for him the command of two hundred and\r\nfifty horsemen.\r\n\r\n8. At the siege of Regal, the Ottomans sent a challenge, purporting that\r\nLord Turbisha, to amuse the ladies, would fight with any captain among\r\nthe Austrian troops. Smith accepted the challenge.\r\n\r\n9. Flags of truce were exchanged between the two armies, and crowds of\r\nfair dames and fearless men assembled to witness the combat. Lord\r\nTurbisha entered the field well mounted and armed.\r\n\r\n10. On his shoulders were fixed two large wings made of eagles\'\r\nfeathers, set in silver, and richly ornamented with gold and precious\r\nstones. A janizary, or Turkish soldier, bore his lance before him, and\r\nanother followed, leading a horse superbly caparisoned.\r\n\r\n11. Smith came upon the ground with less parade. A flourish of trumpets\r\npreceded him, and his lance was supported by a single page.\r\n\r\n12. The Turk fell at the first charge, and Smith returned to his army in\r\ntriumph. This so enraged one of the friends of the slain that he sent a\r\nchallenge to Smith, offering him his head, his horse and his armor, if\r\nhe dared come and take them.\r\n\r\n13. The challenge was accepted, and the combatants came upon the ground\r\nwith nearly the same ceremony and splendor. Their lances broke at the\r\nfirst charge, without doing injury to either; but, at the second onset,\r\nthe Turk was wounded, thrown from his horse, and killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON L.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Christian army were at this time anxious to finish erecting some\r\nfortifications, and were very willing to amuse their enemies in this\r\nway. They therefore persuaded Captain Smith to send a challenge in his\r\nturn, offering his head, in payment for the two he had won, to any one\r\nwho had skill and strength enough to take it.\r\n\r\n2. The offer was accepted; and a third Turk tried his fortune with the\r\nbold adventurer. This time Captain Smith was nearly unhorsed; but, by\r\nhis dexterity and judgment, he recovered himself, and soon returned to\r\nthe camp victorious.\r\n\r\n3. These warlike deeds met with much applause; and the prince gave him a\r\ncoat of arms, signed with the royal seal, representing three Turk\'s\r\nheads on a white field.\r\n\r\n4. Not long after this, Captain Smith was left wounded on the field of\r\nbattle,--was taken prisoner by the Turks,--and sent as a slave to a\r\nnoble lady in the interior of the country.\r\n\r\n5. He could speak Italian well, and his fair mistress was very fond of\r\nthat language. She listened to accounts of his bravery, his adventures,\r\nand his misfortunes, with deepening interest; and finally sent him to\r\nher brother, a powerful bashaw, with a request that he should be treated\r\nwith much kindness.\r\n\r\n6. The proud officer was angry that his sister should trouble herself\r\nabout a vile European slave; and, instead of attending to her request,\r\nhe caused him to be loaded with irons, and abused in the most shameful\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n7. During the long and tedious period of his slavery, he suffered as\r\nmuch as it is possible for man to endure; but at length he killed his\r\ntyrannical master, and, with great peril, escaped through the deserts\r\ninto Russia.\r\n\r\n8. His romantic genius would not long allow him to remain easy. He could\r\nnot be happy unless he was engaged in daring and adventurous actions. He\r\nno sooner heard of an expedition to Virginia, under the command of\r\nChristopher Newport, than he resolved to join it.\r\n\r\n9. He arrived in this country with the first emigrants, who settled in\r\nJamestown, April 26, 1607. It is said this infant settlement must have\r\nperished, had it not been for the courage and ingenuity of Captain\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n10. Once they were all nearly dying with hunger, and the savages utterly\r\nrefused to sell them any food. In this extremity, Smith stole the Indian\r\nidol, Okee, which was made of skins stuffed with moss, and would not\r\nreturn it until the Indians sold them as much corn as they wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LI.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The colony were once in imminent danger of losing their brave and\r\nintelligent friend. While exploring the source of the Chickahominy\r\nriver, he imprudently left his companions, and, while alone, was seen\r\nand pursued by a party of savages. He retreated fighting, killed three\r\nIndians with his own hand, and probably would have regained his boat in\r\nsafety, had he not accidentally plunged into a miry hole, from which he\r\ncould not extricate himself.\r\n\r\n2. By this accident, he was taken prisoner; and the Indians would have\r\ntortured him, and put him to death, according to their cruel customs,\r\nhad not his ever-ready wit come to his aid.\r\n\r\n3. He showed them a small ivory compass, which he had with him, and, by\r\nsigns, explained many wonderful things to them, till his enemies were\r\ninspired with a most profound respect, and resolved not to kill the\r\nextraordinary man without consulting their chief.\r\n\r\n4. He was, accordingly, brought into the presence of the king, Powhatan,\r\nwho received him in a robe of raccoon skins, and seated on a kind of\r\nthrone, with two beautiful young daughters at his side. After a long\r\nconsultation, he was condemned to die.\r\n\r\n5. Two large stones were brought, his head laid upon one of them, and\r\nthe war-clubs raised to strike the deadly blow. At this moment,\r\nPocahontas, the king\'s favorite daughter, sprang forward, threw herself\r\nbetween him and the executioners, and by her entreaties saved his life.\r\n\r\n6. Powhatan promised him that he should return to Jamestown, if the\r\nEnglish would give him a certain quantity of ammunition and trinkets.\r\nSmith agreed to obtain them, provided a messenger would carry a leaf to\r\nhis companions. On this leaf he briefly stated what must be sent.\r\n\r\n7. Powhatan had never heard of writing;--he laughed at the idea that a\r\nleaf could speak, and regarded the whole as an imposition on the part of\r\nthe prisoner.\r\n\r\n8. When, however, the messenger returned with the promised ransom, he\r\nregarded Smith as nothing less than a wizard, and gladly allowed him to\r\ndepart. It seemed to be the fate of this singular man to excite a\r\npowerful interest wherever he went.\r\n\r\n9. Pocahontas had such a deep attachment for him, that, in 1609, when\r\nonly fourteen years old, she stole away from her tribe, and, during a\r\nmost dreary night, walked to Jamestown, to tell him that her father had\r\nformed the design of cutting off the whole English settlement.\r\n\r\n10. Thus she a second time saved his life, at the hazard of her own.\r\nThis charming Indian girl did not meet with all the gratitude she\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\n11. Before 1612, Captain Smith received a wound, which made it necessary\r\nfor him to go to England, for surgical aid; and after his departure a\r\ncopper kettle was offered to any Indian who would bring Pocahontas to\r\nthe English settlement.\r\n\r\n12. She was, accordingly, stolen from her father, and carried prisoner\r\nto Jamestown. Powhatan offered five hundred bushels of corn as a ransom\r\nfor his darling child.\r\n\r\n13. Before the negotiation was finished, an Englishman of good\r\ncharacter, by the name of Thomas Rolfe, became attached to Pocahontas,\r\nand they were soon after married, with the king\'s consent.\r\n\r\n14. This event secured peace to the English for many years. The Indian\r\nbride became a Christian, and was baptized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LII.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, concluded._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In 1616, Pocahontas went to England with her husband,--was introduced\r\nat court, and received great attention.\r\n\r\n2. King James is said to have been very indignant that any of his\r\nsubjects should have dared to marry a princess; but Captain Smith has\r\nbeen accused, perhaps falsely, of being sufficiently cold and selfish to\r\nblush for his acquaintance with the generous North American savage.\r\n\r\n3. Pocahontas never returned to her native country. She died at\r\nGravesend, in 1617, just as she was about to embark for America.\r\n\r\n4. She left one son, Thomas Rolfe; and from his daughter are descended\r\nseveral people of high rank in Virginia, among whom was the celebrated\r\nJohn Randolph of Roanoke.\r\n\r\n5. Smith had many adventures, after his wound obliged him to leave\r\nJamestown. He visited this country again; made a voyage to the Summer\r\nIsles; fought with pirates; joined the French against the Spaniards; and\r\nwas adrift, in a little boat, alone, on the stormy sea, during a night\r\nso tempestuous that thirteen French ships were wrecked, near the Isle\r\nof Re; yet he was saved.\r\n\r\n6. He died in London, in 1631, in the fifty-second year of his age,\r\nafter having published his singular adventures in Europe, Asia, Africa,\r\nand America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LIII.\r\n\r\n_John Ledyard._--JUVENILE MISCELLANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Few men have done so much, in a short life, as John Ledyard. When he\r\nwas a mere boy, he built a canoe with his own hands, and descended\r\nConnecticut river alone and unassisted.\r\n\r\n2. He enlisted as a soldier, at Gibraltar; and afterwards, in the humble\r\ncharacter of corporal of the marines, he sailed round the world with the\r\ncelebrated Captain Cook.\r\n\r\n3. After his return to England, he formed the bold design of traversing\r\nthe northern parts of Europe and Asia, crossing Behring\'s Straits, and\r\nexamining the whole of North America, from east to west.\r\n\r\n4. Sir Joseph Banks, famous for his generosity to men of enterprise,\r\nfurnished him with money for the undertaking. He expended nearly all of\r\nit in purchasing sea stores; and these, most unluckily, were all seized\r\nby a custom-house officer, on account of some articles which the English\r\nlaw forbade to be exported.\r\n\r\n5. Poor Ledyard was now left in utter poverty; but he was a resolute\r\nman, and he would not be discouraged. With only ten guineas in his\r\npurse, he attempted to _walk_ over the greater part of three continents.\r\n\r\n6. He walked through Denmark and Sweden, and attempted to cross the\r\ngreat Gulf of Bothnia, on his way to Siberia; but when he reached the\r\nmiddle of that inland sea, he found the water was not frozen, and he was\r\nobliged to foot it back to Stockholm.\r\n\r\n7. He then traveled round the head of the gulf, and descended to St.\r\nPetersburg. Here he was soon discovered to be a man of talents and\r\nactivity; and though he was without money, and absolutely destitute of\r\nstockings and shoes, he was treated with great attention.\r\n\r\n8. The Portuguese ambassador invited him to dine, and was so much\r\npleased with him, that he used his influence to obtain for him a free\r\npassage in the government wagons, then going to Irkutsk, in Siberia, at\r\nthe command of the Empress Katharine.\r\n\r\n9. He went from this place to Yakutz, and there awaited the opening of\r\nthe spring, full of the animating hope of soon completing his wearisome\r\njourney. But misfortune seemed to follow him wherever he went.\r\n\r\n10. The empress could not believe that any man in his senses was\r\ntraveling through the ice and snows of uncivilized Siberia, merely for\r\nthe sake of seeing the country and the people.\r\n\r\n11. She imagined that he was an English spy, sent there merely for the\r\npurpose of prying into the state of her empire and her government. She\r\ntherefore employed two Russian soldiers to seize him, and convey him out\r\nof her dominions.\r\n\r\n12. Taken, he knew not why, and obliged to go off without his clothes,\r\nhis money, or his papers, he was seated in one of the strange-looking\r\nsledges used in those northern deserts, and carried through Tartary and\r\nWhite Russia, to the frontiers of Poland.\r\n\r\n13. Covered with dirty rags, worn out with hardships, sick almost unto\r\ndeath, without friends and without money, he begged his way to\r\nKonigsberg, in Prussia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LIV.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, concluded._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In this hour of deep distress, he found a person willing to take his\r\ndraft for five guineas on the Royal Society of England. With this\r\nassistance, he arrived in the land of our forefathers.\r\n\r\n2. He immediately applied to his ever-ready friend, Sir Joseph Banks,\r\nfor employment. Sir Joseph, knowing that nothing suited him better than\r\nperilous adventures, told him that a company had just been formed, for\r\nthe purpose of penetrating into the interior of Africa, and discovering\r\nthe source of the river Niger.\r\n\r\n3. Burning sands, savage negroes, venomous serpents, all the frightful\r\nanimals of the torrid zone, could not alarm the intrepid soul of\r\nLedyard. He immediately expressed his desire to go.\r\n\r\n4. When the map was spread before him, and his dangerous journey pointed\r\nout, he promptly exclaimed, "I will go to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n5. The gentleman smiled at his eagerness, and gladly intrusted him with\r\nan expedition in which suffering and peril were certain, and success\r\nextremely doubtful. He left London on the 30th of June, 1788, and\r\narrived in Grand Cairo on the 19th of August.\r\n\r\n6. There he spent his time to great advantage, in searching for and\r\ndeciphering the various wonders of that ancient and once learned land.\r\n\r\n7. His letters from Egypt were delightful. They showed much enthusiasm,\r\nunited with the most patient and laborious exertion. The company formed\r\ngreat hopes concerning his discoveries in Senaar, and awaited letters\r\nfrom that country with much anxiety.\r\n\r\n8. But, alas! he never reached there. He was seized with a violent\r\nillness at Cairo; died, and was decently buried beside the English who\r\nhad ended their days in that celebrated city.\r\n\r\n9. We should never read accounts of great or good men without learning\r\nsome profitable lesson. If we cannot, like Ledyard, defend Gibraltar,\r\nsail round the world with Captain Cook, project trading voyages to the\r\nnorth-west coast, study Egyptian hieroglyph\xc2\xb4ics, and traverse the dreary\r\nnorthern zone on foot,--we can, at least, learn from him the important\r\nlesson of _perseverance_.\r\n\r\n10. The boy who perseveringly pores over a hard lesson, and who will not\r\ngive up an intricate problem until he has studied it out, forms a\r\nhabit, which, in after life, will make him a great man; and he who\r\nresolutely struggles against his own indolence, violent temper, or any\r\nother bad propensity, will most assuredly be a good one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LV.\r\n\r\n_Learning to Work._--ORIGINAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A few years ago, several little volumes were published, called "_The\r\nRollo Books_," which are full of interesting stories about a little boy\r\nof that name. They were written by a gentleman whose name is Abbott.\r\n\r\n2. They are not only interesting, but also very instructive books; and\r\nno little boy or girl can read them, without learning many very useful\r\nlessons from them. They are not only useful to young persons, but their\r\nparents, also, have derived many useful hints from them, in the\r\nmanagement of their children.\r\n\r\n3. The following little story is taken from one of them, called "_Rollo\r\nat Work_;" and I hope that my little friends who read this story at\r\nschool will also read it at home to their parents, because it will be\r\nboth interesting and useful to them.\r\n\r\n4. The story begins, by telling us that Rollo\'s father had set him at\r\nwork in the barn, with a box full of nails, directing him to pick them\r\nall over, and to put all those that were alike by themselves.\r\n\r\n5. Rollo began very willingly at first, but soon grew tired of the work,\r\nand left it unfinished. The remainder of the story will be found in the\r\nfollowing lessons, in Mr. Abbott\'s own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LVI.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, continued._--ABBOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. That evening, when Rollo was just going to bed, his father took him\r\nup in his lap, and told him he had concluded what to do.\r\n\r\n2. "You see it is very necessary," said he, "that you should have the\r\npower of confining yourself steadily and patiently to a single\r\nemployment, even if it does not amuse you.\r\n\r\n3. "I have to do that, and all people have to do it; and you must learn\r\nto do it, or you will grow up indolent and useless. You cannot do it\r\nnow, it is very plain.\r\n\r\n4. "If I set you to doing anything, you go on as long as the novelty and\r\nthe amusement last; and then your patience is gone, and you contrive\r\nevery possible excuse for getting away from your task.\r\n\r\n5. "Now, I am going to give you one hour\'s work to do, every forenoon\r\nand afternoon. I shall give you such things to do as are perfectly plain\r\nand easy, so that you will have no excuse for neglecting your work, or\r\nleaving it.\r\n\r\n6. "But yet I shall choose such things as will afford you no amusement;\r\nfor my wish is that you should learn to work, not play."\r\n\r\n7. "But, father," said Rollo, "you told me there was pleasure in work,\r\nthe other day. But how can there be any pleasure in it, if you choose\r\nsuch things as have no amusement in them, at all?"\r\n\r\n8. "The pleasure of working," said his father, "is not the fun of doing\r\namusing things, but the satisfaction and solid happiness of being\r\nfaithful in duty, and accomplishing some useful purpose.\r\n\r\n9. "For example, if I were to lose my pocket-book on the road, and\r\nshould tell you to walk back a mile, and look carefully all the way,\r\nuntil you found it, and if you did it faithfully and carefully, you\r\nwould find a kind of satisfaction in doing it; and when you found the\r\npocket-book, and brought it back to me, you would enjoy a high degree\r\nof happiness. Should not you?"\r\n\r\n10. "Why, yes, sir, I should," said Rollo.--"And, yet, there would be no\r\namusement in it. You might, perhaps, the next day, go over the same\r\nroad, catching butterflies; that would be amusement. Now, the pleasure\r\nyou would enjoy in looking for the pocket-book would be the solid\r\nsatisfaction of useful work.\r\n\r\n11. "The pleasure of catching butterflies would be the amusement of\r\nplay. Now, the difficulty is, with you, that you have scarcely any idea,\r\nyet, of the first.\r\n\r\n12. "You are all the time looking for the other; that is, the amusement.\r\nYou begin to work, when I give you anything to do; but if you do not\r\nfind amusement in it, you soon give it up. But if you would only\r\npersevere, you would find, at length, a solid satisfaction, that would\r\nbe worth a great deal more."\r\n\r\n13. Rollo sat still, and listened; but his father saw, from his looks,\r\nthat he was not much interested in what he was saying; and he perceived\r\nthat it was not at all probable that so small a boy could be reasoned\r\ninto liking work.\r\n\r\n14. In fact, it was rather hard for Rollo to understand all that his\r\nfather said; and still harder for him to feel the force of it. He began\r\nto grow sleepy, and so his father let him go to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LVII.\r\n\r\n_The same subject, concluded._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. The next day, his father gave him his work. He was to begin at ten\r\no\'clock, and work till eleven, gathering beans in the garden.\r\n\r\n2. His father went out with him, and waited to see how long it took him\r\nto gather half a pint, and then calculated how many he could gather in\r\nan hour, if he was industrious. Rollo knew that if he failed now he\r\nshould be punished in some way, although his father did not say anything\r\nabout punishment.\r\n\r\n3. When he was set at work, the day before, about the nails, he was\r\nmaking an experiment, as it were, and he did not expect to be actually\r\npunished, if he failed; but now he knew that he was under orders, and\r\nmust obey.\r\n\r\n4. So he worked very diligently, and when his father came out, at the\r\nend of the hour, he found that Rollo had got rather more beans than he\r\nhad expected. Rollo was much gratified to see his father pleased; and he\r\ncarried in his large basket full of beans to show his mother, with great\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n5. Then he went to play, and enjoyed himself very highly. The next\r\nmorning, his father said to him,--"Well, Rollo, you did very well\r\nyesterday; but doing right once is a very different thing from forming a\r\nhabit of doing right. I can hardly expect you will succeed as well\r\nto-day; or, if you should to-day, that you will to-morrow."\r\n\r\n6. Rollo thought he should. His work was to pick up all the loose stones\r\nin the road, and carry them, in a basket, to a great heap of stones\r\nbehind the barn.\r\n\r\n7. But he was not quite faithful. His father observed him playing\r\nseveral times. He did not speak to him, however, until the hour was\r\nover; and then he called him in.\r\n\r\n8. "Rollo," said he, "you have failed to-day. You have not been very\r\nidle, but have not been industrious; and the punishment which I have\r\nconcluded to try first is, to give you only bread and water for dinner."\r\n\r\n9. So, when dinner-time came, and the family sat down to the good\r\nbeef-steak and apple-pie which was upon the table, Rollo knew that he\r\nwas not to come. He felt very unhappy, but he did not cry.\r\n\r\n10. His father called him, and cut off a good slice of bread, and put\r\ninto his hands, and told him he might go and eat it on the steps of the\r\nback door. "If you should be thirsty," he added, "you may ask Mary to\r\ngive you some water."\r\n\r\n11. Rollo took the bread, and went out, and took his solitary seat on\r\nthe stone step leading into the back yard; and, in spite of all his\r\nefforts to prevent it, the tears would come into his eyes.\r\n\r\n12. He thought of his guilt in disobeying his father, and he felt\r\nunhappy to think that his father and mother were seated together at\r\ntheir pleasant table, and that he could not come, because he had been an\r\nundutiful son. He determined that he would never be unfaithful in his\r\nwork again.\r\n\r\n13. He went on, after this, several days, very well. His father gave him\r\nvarious kinds of work to do, and he began, at last, to find a\r\nconsiderable degree of satisfaction in doing it.\r\n\r\n14. He found, particularly, that he enjoyed himself a great deal more\r\nafter his work than before; and, whenever he saw what he had done, it\r\ngave him pleasure.\r\n\r\n15. After he had picked up the loose stones before the house, for\r\ninstance, he drove his hoop about there with unusual satisfaction;\r\nenjoying the neat and tidy appearance of the road much more than he\r\nwould have done, if Jonas had cleared it. In fact, in the course of a\r\nmonth, Rollo became quite a faithful and efficient little workman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LVIII.\r\n\r\n_The Comma._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMA is a mark like this =,=\r\n\r\nWhen you come to a comma in reading, you must generally make a short\r\npause. Sometimes you must use the falling inflection of the voice, when\r\nyou come to a comma; and sometimes you must keep your voice suspended,\r\nas if some one had stopped you before you had read all that you\r\nintended. The general rule, when you come to a comma, is, to stop just\r\nlong enough to count one.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nDiligence, industry, and proper improvement of time, are material duties\r\nof the young.\r\n\r\nHe is generous, just, charitable, and humane.\r\n\r\nBy wisdom, by art, by the united strength of a civil community, men have\r\nbeen enabled to subdue the whole race of lions, bears, and serpents.\r\n\r\n     [Sometimes a comma must be read like a question.]\r\n\r\nDo you pretend to sit as high in school as Anthony?

not to set off the beauty of\r\nyour person, but to declare the sobriety of your mind; that your outward\r\ngarb may resemble the inward plainness and simplicity of your heart.\r\n\r\nIn meat and drink, observe the rules of Christian temperance and\r\nsobriety; consider your body only as the servant and minister of your\r\nsoul; and only so nourish it, as it may best perform an humble and\r\nobedient service.\r\n\r\nCondescend to all the weakness and infirmities of your fellow-creatures;\r\ncover their frailties; love their excellences; encourage their virtues;\r\nrelieve their wants; rejoice in their prosperity; compassionate their\r\ndistress; receive their friendship; overlook their unkindness; forgive\r\ntheir malice; be a servant of servants; and condescend to do the lowest\r\noffices for the lowest of mankind.\r\n\r\n     [The semicolon is sometimes used for a question, and\r\n     sometimes as an exclamation.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nHast thou not set at defiance my authority; violated the public peace,\r\nand passed thy life in injuring the persons and properties of thy\r\nfellow-subjects?\r\n\r\nO, it was impious; it was unmanly; it was poor and pitiful!\r\n\r\nHave not you too gone about the earth like an evil genius; blasting the\r\nfair fruits of peace and industry; plundering, ravaging, killing,\r\nwithout law, without justice, merely to gratify an insatiable lust for\r\ndominion?\r\n\r\nWhat a glorious monument of human invention, that has thus triumphed\r\nover wind and wave; has brought the ends of the earth in communion; has\r\nestablished an interchange of blessings, pouring into the sterile\r\nregions of the north all the luxuries of the south; diffused the light\r\nof knowledge and the charities of cultivated life; and has thus bound\r\ntogether those scattered portions of the human race, between which\r\nNature seemed to have thrown an insurmountable barrier!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LX.\r\n\r\n_The Colon._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLON consists of two periods placed one above the other, thus =:=\r\n\r\nSometimes the passage ending with a colon is to be read with the voice\r\nsuspended; but it should generally be read with the falling inflection\r\nof the voice.\r\n\r\nThe general rule, when you come to a colon, is to stop just long enough\r\nto count three; or three times as long as you are directed to pause at a\r\ncomma.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nLaw and order are forgotten: violence and rapine are abroad: the golden\r\ncords of society are loosed.\r\n\r\nThe temples are profaned: the soldier\'s curse resounds in the house of\r\nGod: the marble pavement is trampled by iron hoofs: horses neigh beside\r\nthe altar.\r\n\r\nBlue wreaths of smoke ascend through the trees, and betray the\r\nhalf-hidden cottage: the eye contemplates well-thatched ricks, and barns\r\nbursting with plenty: the peasant laughs at the approach of winter.\r\n\r\n     [The following passages ending with a colon are to be\r\n     read with the voice suspended:]\r\n\r\nDo not flatter yourselves with the hope of perfect happiness: there is\r\nno such thing in the world.\r\n\r\nA boy at school is by no means at liberty to read what books he pleases:\r\nhe must give attention to those which contain his lessons; so that, when\r\nhe is called upon to recite, he may be ready, fluent, and accurate, in\r\nrepeating the portion assigned him.\r\n\r\nAs we perceive the shadow to have moved along the dial, but did not\r\nperceive its moving; and it appears that the grass has grown, though\r\nnobody ever saw it grow: so the advances we make in knowledge, as they\r\nconsist of such minute steps, are perceivable only by the distance gone\r\nover.\r\n\r\nWhen the proud steed shall know why man restrains his fiery course, or\r\ndrives him o\'er the plains; when the dull ox, why now he breaks the\r\nclod, is now a victim, and now Egypt\'s god: then shall man\'s pride and\r\ndullness comprehend his actions\', passions\', being\'s use and end.\r\n\r\nJehovah, God of hosts, hath sworn, saying: Surely, as I have devised, so\r\nshall it be; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand.\r\n\r\nGeorge, you must not laugh at me; I will not bear it. You forget what\r\nyou are about when you ridicule me: I know more than you do about the\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\nI never heard a word about it before, said George, yesterday: who told\r\nyou about it, Charles?\r\n\r\nI never heard one word of it before, said my uncle Toby, hastily: how\r\ncame he there, Trim?\r\n\r\nThou shalt pronounce this parable upon the King of Babylon; and shalt\r\nsay: How hath the oppressor ceased?\r\n\r\nIt is not only in the sacred fane that homage should be paid to the Most\r\nHigh: there is a temple, one not made with hands; the vaulted firmament:\r\nfar in the woods, almost beyond the sound of city-chime, at intervals\r\nheard through the breezeless air.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: List of textbooks]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Notes:\r\n\r\nTo retain the flavor of this schoolbook, the Transcriber has left all\r\ngrammar errors in tact.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
