Of this collection that\r\ncan properly be claimed. For a decade NORMAL INSTRUCTOR-PRIMARY PLANS\r\nhas carried monthly a page entitled "Poems Our Readers Have Asked For."\r\nThe interest in this page has been, and is, phenomenal. Occasionally\r\nspace considerations or copyright restrictions have prevented compliance\r\nwith requests, but so far as practicable poems asked for have been\r\nprinted. Because it has become impossible to furnish many of the earlier\r\nissues of the magazine, the publishers decided to select the poems most\r\noften requested and, carefully revising these for possible errors, to\r\ninclude them in the present collection. In some cases the desired poems\r\nare old favorite dramatic recitations, but many of them are poems that\r\nare required or recommended for memorizing in state courses of study.\r\nThis latter feature will of itself make the book extremely valuable to\r\nteachers throughout the country. We are glad to offer here certain\r\npoems, often requested, but too long for insertion on our magazine\r\nPoetry Page. We are pleased also to be able to include a number of\r\npopular copyright poems. Special permission to use these has been\r\ngranted through arrangement with the authorized publishers, whose\r\ncourtesy is acknowledged below in detail:\r\n\r\nTHE BOBBS-MERRILL COMPANY--_The Raggedy Man_, from "The Biographical\r\nEdition of the Complete Works of James Whitcomb Riley," copyright 1918.\r\n\r\nCHARLES SCRIBNER\'S SONS--_Seein\' Things_ and _Little Boy Blue_, by\r\nEugene Field; _Gradatim_ and _Give Us Men_, from "The Poetical Works of\r\nJ.G.

My Captain!\r\n\r\n(_This poem was written in memory of Abraham Lincoln._)\r\n\r\n\r\nO Captain! My Captain! our fearful trip is done,\r\nThe ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won;\r\nThe port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,\r\nWhile follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;\r\n  But, O heart! heart! heart!\r\n      O the bleeding drops of red,\r\n  Where on the deck my Captain lies,\r\n      Fallen, cold and dead.\r\n\r\nO Captain! My Captain! rise up and hear the bells;\r\nRise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills,\r\nFor you bouquets and ribboned wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding,\r\nFor you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;\r\n  Here Captain! dear father!\r\n      This arm beneath your head!\r\n  It is some dream that on the deck\r\n     You\'ve fallen cold and dead.\r\n\r\nMy Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;\r\nMy father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse or will;\r\nThe ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;\r\nFrom fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;\r\n  Exult, O shores! and ring, O bells!\r\n      But I, with mournful tread,\r\n  Walk the deck my Captain lies,\r\n      Fallen, cold and dead.\r\n\r\n    _Walt Whitman._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Poet\'s Prophecy\r\n\r\n\r\nFor I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,\r\nSaw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;\r\nSaw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,\r\nPilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales;\r\nHeard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained a ghastly dew\r\nFrom the nations\' airy navies grappling in the central blue;\r\nFar along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,\r\nWith the standards of the peoples plunging through the thunderstorm;\r\nTill the war-drum throbb\'d no longer, and the battleflags were furl\'d\r\nIn the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.\r\nThere the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,\r\nAnd the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.\r\n\r\n    _Tennyson, "Locksley Hall," 1842._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Landing of the Pilgrims\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breaking waves dashed high\r\n  On a stern and rock-bound coast,\r\nAnd the woods against a stormy sky\r\n  Their giant branches tossed;\r\n\r\nAnd the heavy night hung dark\r\n  The hills and waters o\'er,\r\nWhen a band of exiles moored their bark\r\n  On the wild New England shore.\r\n\r\nNot as the conqueror comes,\r\n  They, the true-hearted, came,--\r\nNot with the roll of the stirring drums,\r\n  And the trumpet that sings of fame;\r\n\r\nNot as the flying come,\r\n  In silence and in fear;\r\nThey shook the depths of the desert\'s gloom\r\n  With their hymns of lofty cheer.\r\n\r\nAmidst the storms they sang;\r\n  And the stars heard, and the sea;\r\nAnd the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang\r\n  To the anthem of the free.\r\n\r\nThe ocean eagle soared\r\n  From his nest by the white wave\'s foam;\r\nAnd the rocking pines of the forest roared--\r\n  This was their welcome home!\r\n\r\nThere were men with hoary hair\r\n  Amidst that pilgrim band:\r\nWhy had they come to wither there\r\n  Away from their childhood\'s land?\r\n\r\nThere was woman\'s fearless eye,\r\n  Lit by her deep love\'s truth;\r\nThere was manhood\'s brow serenely high,\r\n  And the fiery heart of youth.\r\n\r\nWhat sought they thus afar?\r\n  Bright jewels of the mine?\r\nThe wealth of seas, the spoils of war?--\r\n  They sought a faith\'s pure shrine.\r\n\r\nAy, call it holy ground,--\r\n  The soil where first they trod!\r\nThey have left unstained what there they found--\r\n  Freedom to worship God!\r\n\r\n    _Felicia Hemans._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBobby Shaftoe\r\n\r\n\r\n"Marie, will you marry me?\r\nFor you know how I love thee!\r\nTell me, darling, will you be\r\n  The wife of Bobby Shaftoe?"\r\n\r\n"Bobby, pray don\'t ask me more,\r\nFor you\'ve asked me twice before;\r\nLet us be good friends, no more,\r\n  No more, Bobby Shaftoe."\r\n\r\n"If you will not marry me,\r\nI will go away to sea;\r\nAnd you ne\'er again shall be\r\n  A friend of Bobby Shaftoe."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you will not go away\r\nFor you\'ve said so twice to-day.\r\nStop! He\'s gone! Dear Bobby, stay!\r\n  Dearest Bobby Shaftoe!\r\n\r\n"Bobby Shaftoe\'s gone to sea,\r\nSilver buckles on his knee,\r\nBut he\'ll come back and marry me,\r\n  Pretty Bobby Shaftoe.\r\n\r\n"He will soon come back to me,\r\nAnd how happy I shall be,\r\nHe\'ll come back and marry me,\r\n  Dearest Bobby Shaftoe."\r\n\r\n"Bobby Shaftoe\'s lost at sea,\r\nHe cannot come back to thee.\r\nAnd you ne\'er again will see\r\n  Your dear Bobby Shaftoe.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we sadly mourn for thee,\r\nAnd regret we ne\'er shall see\r\nOur friend Bobby, true and free,\r\n  Dearest Bobby Shaftoe."\r\n\r\n"Bobby Shaftoe\'s lost at sea.\r\nAnd can ne\'er come back to me,\r\nBut I\'ll ever faithful be,\r\n  True to Bobby Shaftoe."\r\n\r\n"Darling, I\'ve come home from sea,\r\nI\'ve come back to marry thee,\r\nFor I know you\'re true to me,\r\n  True to Bobby Shaftoe."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I always cared for thee,\r\nAnd now you\'ve come back to me,\r\nAnd we will always happy be,\r\n  Dearest Bobby Shaftoe."\r\n\r\n"Bobby Shaftoe\'s come from sea,\r\nAnd we will united be,\r\nHeart and hand in unity,\r\n  Mr. and Mrs. Shaftoe."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Overworked Elocutionist\r\n\r\n(Or "ROBERT REESE")\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce there was a little boy\r\n  Whose name was Robert Reese,\r\nAnd every Friday afternoon\r\n  He had to speak a piece.\r\n\r\nSo many poems thus he learned\r\n  That soon he had a store\r\nOf recitations in his head\r\n  And still kept learning more.\r\n\r\nNow this it is what happened:\r\n  He was called upon one week\r\nAnd totally forgot the piece\r\n  He was about to speak.\r\n\r\nHis brain he vainly cudgeled\r\n  But no word was in his head,\r\nAnd so he spoke at random,\r\n  And this is what he said;\r\n\r\nMy beautiful, my beautiful,\r\n  Who standest proudly by,\r\nIt was the schooner Hesperus\r\n  The breaking waves dashed high.\r\n\r\nWhy is the Forum crowded?\r\n  What means this stir in Rome?\r\nUnder a spreading chestnut tree\r\n  There is no place like home.\r\n\r\nWhen Freedom from her mountain height\r\n  Cried, "Twinkle, little star,"\r\nShoot if you must this old gray head,\r\n  King Henry of Navarre.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re waking, call me early\r\n  To be or not to be,\r\nCurfew must not ring to-night,\r\n  Oh, woodman, spare that tree.\r\n\r\nCharge, Chester, Charge!

Herschell._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKentucky Belle\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer of \'sixty-three, sir, and Conrad was gone away--\r\nGone to the county-town, sir, to sell our first load of hay--\r\nWe lived in the log house yonder, poor as ever you\'ve seen;\r\nRoschen there was a baby, and I was only nineteen.\r\n\r\nConrad, he took the oxen, but he left Kentucky Belle.\r\nHow much we thought of Kentuck, I couldn\'t begin to tell--\r\nCame from the Blue-Grass country; my father gave her to me\r\nWhen I rode north with Conrad, away from the Tennessee.\r\n\r\nConrad lived in Ohio--a German he is, you know--\r\nThe house stood in broad cornfields, stretching on, row after row.\r\nThe old folks made me welcome; they were kind as kind could be;\r\nBut I kept longing, longing, for the hills of the Tennessee.\r\n\r\nOh, for a sight of water, the shadowed slope of a hill!\r\nClouds that hang on the summit, a wind that never is still!\r\nBut the level land went stretching away to meet the sky--\r\nNever a rise, from north to south, to rest the weary eye!\r\n\r\nFrom east to west, no river to shine out under the moon,\r\nNothing to make a shadow in the yellow afternoon:\r\nOnly the breathless sunshine, as I looked out, all forlorn;\r\nOnly the rustle, rustle, as I walked among the corn.\r\n\r\nWhen I fell sick with pining, we didn\'t wait any more,\r\nBut moved away from the cornlands, out to this river shore--\r\nThe Tuscarawas it\'s called, sir--off there\'s a hill, you see--\r\nAnd now I\'ve grown to like it next best to the Tennessee.\r\n\r\nI was at work that morning. Some one came riding like mad\r\nOver the bridge and up the road--Farmer Rouf\'s little lad.\r\nBareback he rode; he had no hat; he hardly stopped to say,\r\n"Morgan\'s men are coming, Frau; they\'re galloping on this way.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sent to warn the neighbors. He isn\'t a mile behind;\r\nHe sweeps up all the horses--every horse that he can find.\r\nMorgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan\'s terrible men,\r\nWith bowie knives and pistols, are galloping up the glen!"\r\n\r\nThe lad rode down the valley, and I stood still at the door;\r\nThe baby laughed and prattled, playing with spools on the floor;\r\nKentuck was out in the pasture; Conrad, my man, was gone.\r\nNearer, nearer, Morgan\'s men were galloping, galloping on!\r\n\r\nSudden I picked up baby, and ran to the pasture bar.\r\n"Kentuck!" I called--"Kentucky!" She knew me ever so far!\r\nI led her down the gully that turns off there to the right,\r\nAnd tied her to the bushes; her head was just out of sight.\r\n\r\nAs I ran back to the log house, at once there came a sound--\r\nThe ring of hoofs, galloping hoofs, trembling over the ground--\r\nComing into the turnpike out from the White Woman Glen--\r\nMorgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan\'s terrible men.\r\n\r\nAs near they drew and nearer, my heart beat fast in alarm;\r\nBut still I stood in the doorway with baby on my arm.\r\nThey came, they passed; with spur and whip in haste they sped along--\r\nMorgan, Morgan the raider, and his band, six hundred strong.\r\n\r\nWeary they looked and jaded, riding through night and through day;\r\nPushing on east to the river, many long miles away,\r\nTo the border strip where Virginia runs up into the West,\r\nAnd fording the Upper Ohio before they could stop to rest.\r\n\r\nOn like the wind they hurried, and Morgan rode in advance;\r\nBright were his eyes like live coals, as he gave me a sideways glance.\r\nAnd I was just breathing freely, after my choking pain,\r\nWhen the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein.\r\n\r\nFrightened I was to death, sir; I scarce dared look in his face,\r\nAs he asked for a drink of water, and glanced around the place.\r\nI gave him a cup, and he smiled--\'twas only a boy, you see;\r\nFaint and worn, with dim blue eyes; and he\'d sailed on the Tennessee.\r\n\r\nOnly sixteen he was, sir--a fond mother\'s only son--\r\nOff and away with Morgan before his life had begun!\r\nThe damp drops stood on his temples; drawn was the boyish mouth;\r\nAnd I thought me of the mother waiting down in the South.\r\n\r\nOh! pluck was he to the backbone, and clear grit through and through;\r\nBoasted and bragged like a trooper; but the big words wouldn\'t do;--\r\nThe boy was dying, sir, dying as plain as plain could be,\r\nWorn out by his ride with Morgan up from the Tennessee.\r\n\r\nBut when I told the laddie that I too was from the South,\r\nWater came in his dim eyes, and quivers around his mouth.\r\n"Do you know the Blue-Grass country?" he wistful began to say;\r\nThen swayed like a willow sapling, and fainted dead away.\r\n\r\nI had him into the log house, and worked and brought him to;\r\nI fed him, and I coaxed him, as I thought his mother\'d do;\r\nAnd when the lad got better, and the noise in his head was gone,\r\nMorgan\'s men--were miles; away, galloping, galloping on.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I must go," he muttered; "I must be up and away!\r\nMorgan--Morgan is waiting for me; Oh, what will Morgan say?"\r\nBut I heard a sound of tramping and kept him back from the door--\r\nThe ringing sound of horses\' hoofs that I had heard before.\r\n\r\nAnd on, on, came the soldiers--the Michigan cavalry--\r\nAnd fast they rode, and black they looked, galloping rapidly,--\r\nThey had followed hard on Morgan\'s track; they had followed day and night;\r\nBut of Morgan and Morgan\'s raiders they had never caught a sight.\r\n\r\nAnd rich Ohio sat startled through all those summer days;\r\nFor strange, wild men were galloping over her broad highways--\r\nNow here, now there, now seen, now gone, now north, now east, now west,\r\nThrough river-valleys and cornland farms, sweeping away her best.\r\n\r\nA bold ride and a long ride; but they were taken at last.\r\nThey almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast;\r\nBut the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the ford,\r\nAnd Morgan, Morgan the raider, laid down his terrible sword.\r\n\r\nWell, I kept the boy till evening--kept him against his will--\r\nBut he was too weak to follow, and sat there pale and still.\r\nWhen it was cool and dusky--you\'ll wonder to hear me tell--\r\nBut I stole down to that gully, and brought up Kentucky Belle.\r\n\r\nI kissed the star on her forehead--my pretty gentle lass--\r\nBut I knew that she\'d be happy back in the old Blue-Grass.\r\nA suit of clothes of Conrad\'s, with all the money I had,\r\nAnd Kentuck, pretty Kentuck, I gave to the worn-out lad.\r\n\r\nI guided him to the southward as well as I know how;\r\nThe boy rode off with many thanks, and many a backward bow;\r\nAnd then the glow it faded, and my heart began to swell,\r\nAs down the glen away she went, my lost Kentucky Belle!\r\n\r\nWhen Conrad came in the evening, the moon was shining high;\r\nBaby and I were both crying--I couldn\'t tell him why--\r\nBut a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the wall,\r\nAnd a thin old horse, with drooping head, stood in Kentucky\'s stall.\r\n\r\nWell, he was kind, and never once said a hard word to me;\r\nHe knew I couldn\'t help it--\'twas all for the Tennessee,\r\nBut, after the war was over, just think what came to pass--\r\nA letter, sir; and the two were safe back in the old Blue-Grass.\r\n\r\nThe lad had got across the border, riding Kentucky Belle;\r\nAnd Kentuck, she was thriving, and fat, and hearty, and well;\r\nHe cared for her, and kept her, nor touched her with whip or spur.\r\nAh! we\'ve had many horses since, but never a horse like her!\r\n\r\n    _Constance F. Woolson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Inventor\'s Wife\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember it all so very well, the first of my married life,\r\n  That I can\'t believe it was years ago--it doesn\'t seem true at all;\r\nWhy, I just can see the little church where they made us man and wife,\r\n  And the merry glow of the first wood-fire that danced on our cottage\r\n          wall.\r\n\r\n_We were happy?_ Yes; and we prospered, too; the house belonged\r\n          to Joe,\r\n  And then, he worked in the planing mill, and drew the best of pay;\r\nAnd our cup was full when Joey came,--our baby-boy, you know;\r\n  So, all went well till that mill burned down and the owner moved away.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t long till Joe found work, but \'twas never quite the same,--\r\n  Never steady, with smaller pay; so to make the two ends meet\r\nHe fell to inventin\' some machine--I don\'t recall the name,\r\n  But he\'d sit for hours in his little shop that opens toward the\r\n          street,--\r\n\r\nSit for hours, bent over his work, his tools all strewn about.\r\n  I used to want to go in there to dust and sweep the floor,\r\nBut \'twas just as if \'twas the parson there, writing his sermon out;\r\n  Even the baby--bless the child!--learned never to slam that door!\r\n\r\nPeople called him a clever man, and folks from the city came\r\n  To look at his new invention and wish my Joe success;\r\nAnd Joe would say, "Little woman,"--for that was my old pet-name,--\r\n  "If my plan succeeds, you shall have a coach and pair, and a fine silk\r\n          dress!"\r\n\r\nI didn\'t want \'em, the grand new things, but it made the big tears start\r\n  To see my Joe with his restless eyes, his fingers worn away\r\nTo the skin and bone, for he wouldn\'t eat; and it almost broke my heart\r\n  When he tossed at night from side to side, till the dawning of the day.\r\n\r\nOf course, with it all he lost his place. I couldn\'t blame the man,\r\n  The foreman there at the factory, for losing faith in Joe,\r\nFor his mind was never upon his work, but on some invention-plan,\r\n  As with folded arms and his head bent down he wandered to and fro.\r\n\r\nYet, he kept on workin\' at various things, till our little money went\r\n  For wheels and screws and metal casts and things I had never seen;\r\nAnd I ceased to ask, "Any pay, my dear?" with the answer, "Not a cent!"\r\n  When his lock and his patent-saw had failed, he clung to that great\r\n          machine.\r\n\r\nI remember one special thing that year. He had bought some costly tool,\r\n  When we wanted our boy to learn to read--he was five years old, you\r\n          know;\r\nHe went to his class with cold, bare feet, till at last he came from\r\n          school\r\n  And gravely said, "Don\'t send me back; the children tease me so!"\r\n\r\nI hadn\'t the heart to cross the child, so, while I sat and sewed\r\n  He would rock his little sister in the cradle at my side;\r\nAnd when the struggle was hardest and I felt keen hunger\'s goad\r\n  Driving me almost to despair--the little baby died.\r\n\r\nHer father came to the cradle-side, as she lay, so small and white;\r\n  "Maggie," he said, "I have killed this child, and now I am killing you!\r\nI swear by heaven, I will give it up!" Yet, like a thief, that night\r\n  He stole to the shop and worked; his brow all wet with a clammy dew.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell how I lived that week, my little boy and I,\r\n  Too proud to beg; too weak to work; and the weather cold and wild.\r\nI can only think of one dark night when the rain poured from the sky,\r\n  And the wind went wailing round the house, like the ghost of my buried\r\n          child.\r\n\r\nJoe still toiled in the little shop. Somebody clicked the gate;\r\n  A neighbor-lad brought in the mail and laid it on the floor,\r\nBut I sat half-stunned by my heavy grief crouched over the empty grate,\r\n  Till I heard--the crack of a pistol-shot; and I sprang to the workshop\r\n          door.\r\n\r\nThat door was locked and the bolt shut fast. I could not cry, nor speak,\r\n  But I snatched my boy from the corner there, sick with a sudden dread,\r\nAnd carried him out through the garden plot, forgetting my arms were weak,\r\n  Forgetting the rainy torrent that beat on my bare young head;\r\n\r\nThe front door yielded to my touch. I staggered faintly in,\r\n  Fearing--_what_? He stood unharmed, though the wall showed a\r\n          jagged hole.\r\nIn his trembling hand, his aim had failed, and the great and deadly sin\r\n  Of his own life\'s blood was not yet laid on the poor man\'s tortured soul.\r\n\r\nBut the pistol held another charge, I knew; and like something mad\r\n  I shook my fist in my poor man\'s face, and shrieked at him, fierce and\r\n          wild,\r\n"How can you dare to rob us so?"--and I seized the little lad;\r\n  "How can you dare to rob your wife and your little helpless child?"\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, he bowed his head, while from his nerveless hand\r\n  That hung so limp, I almost feared to see the pistol fall.\r\n"Maggie," he said in a low, low voice, "you see me as I stand\r\n  A hopeless man. My plan has failed. That letter tells you all."\r\n\r\nThen for a moment the house was still as ever the house of death;\r\n  Only the drip of the rain outside, for the storm was almost o\'er;\r\nBut no;--there followed another sound, and I started, caught my breath;\r\n  As a stalwart man with a heavy step came in at the open door.\r\n\r\nI shall always think him an angel sent from heaven in a human guise;\r\n  He must have guessed our awful state; he couldn\'t help but see\r\nThere was something wrong; but never a word, never a look in his eyes\r\n  Told what he thought, as in kindly way he talked to Joe and me.\r\n\r\nHe was come from a thriving city firm, and they\'d sent him here to say\r\n  That _one_ of Joe\'s inventions was a great, successful thing;\r\nAnd which do you think? His window-catch that he\'d tinkered up one day;\r\n  And we were to have a good per cent on the sum that each would bring.\r\n\r\nAnd then the pleasant stranger went, and we wakened as from a dream.\r\n  My man bent down his head and said, "Little woman, you\'ve saved my life!"\r\nThe worn look gone from his dear gray eyes, and in its place, a gleam\r\n  From the sun that has shone so brightly since, on Joe and his happy\r\n          wife!\r\n\r\n    _Jeannie Pendleton Ewing._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Glasses\r\n\r\n\r\nThere sat two glasses filled to the brim\r\nOn a rich man\'s table, rim to rim,\r\nOne was ruddy and red as blood,\r\nAnd one was clear as the crystal flood.\r\n\r\nSaid the Glass of Wine to his paler brother:\r\n"Let us tell tales of the past to each other;\r\nI can tell of banquet and revel and mirth,\r\nWhere I was king, for I ruled in might;\r\nFor the proudest and grandest souls of earth\r\nFell under my touch, as though struck with blight.\r\nFrom the heads of kings I have torn the crown;\r\nFrom the heights of fame I have hurled men down.\r\nI have blasted many an honored name;\r\nI have taken virtue and given shame;\r\nI have tempted youth with a sip, a taste,\r\nThat has made his future a barren waste.\r\nFar greater than any king am I,\r\nOr than any army beneath the sky.\r\nI have made the arm of the driver fail,\r\nAnd sent the train from the iron rail.\r\nI have made good ships go down at sea.\r\nAnd the shrieks of the lost were sweet to me.\r\nFame, strength, wealth, genius before me fall;\r\nAnd my might and power are over all!\r\nHo, ho, pale brother," said the Wine,\r\n"Can you boast of deeds as great as mine?"\r\n\r\nSaid the Water Glass: "I cannot boast\r\nOf a king dethroned, or a murdered host;\r\nBut I can tell of hearts that were sad,\r\nBy my crystal drops made bright and glad;\r\nOf thirsts I have quenched and brows I have laved,\r\nOf hands I have cooled, and souls I have saved.\r\nI have leaped through the valley, dashed down the mountain,\r\nSlipped from the sunshine, and dripped from the fountain,\r\nI have burst my cloud-fetters, and dropped from the sky,\r\nAnd everywhere gladdened the prospect and eye;\r\nI have eased the hot forehead of fever and pain,\r\nI have made the parched meadows grow fertile with grain.\r\nI can tell of the powerful wheel of the mill,\r\nThat ground out the flour, and turned at my will.\r\nI can tell of manhood debased by you\r\nThat I have uplifted and crowned anew;\r\nI cheer, I help, I strengthen and aid,\r\nI gladden the heart of man and maid;\r\nI set the wine-chained captive free,\r\nAnd all are better for knowing me."\r\n\r\nThese are the tales they told each other,\r\nThe Glass of Wine, and its paler brother,\r\nAs they sat together, filled to the brim,\r\nOn a rich man\'s table, rim to rim.\r\n\r\n    _Ella Wheeler Wilcox._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln\r\n\r\n(_Written after Lincoln\'s death by Tom Taylor, famous cartoonist of the\r\nLondon "Punch."_)\r\n\r\n\r\n_You_ lay a wreath on murdered Lincoln\'s bier!\r\n  _You_, who with mocking pencil wont to trace,\r\nBroad for the

rear anew,\r\nBetween the mourners at his head and feet--\r\n  Say, scurril jester, is there room for you?\r\n\r\nYes, he had lived to shame me from my sneer--\r\n  To lame my pencil and confute my pen--\r\nTo make me own this hind, of princes peer,\r\n  This rail-splitter, a true-born king of men.\r\n\r\nMy shallow judgment I had learned to rue,\r\n  Noting how to occasion\'s height he rose;\r\nHow his quaint wit made home-truth seem more true,\r\n  How, iron-like, his temper grew by blows;\r\n\r\nHow humble, yet how hopeful he could be;\r\n  How in good fortune and in ill the same;\r\nNor bitter in success, nor boastful he,\r\n  Thirsty for gold, nor feverish for fame.\r\n\r\nHe went about his work--such work as few\r\n  Ever had laid on head, and heart, and hand--\r\nAs one who knows where there\'s a task to do,\r\n  Man\'s honest will must Heaven\'s good grace command;\r\n\r\nWho trusts the strength will with the burden grow,\r\n  That God makes instruments to work His will,\r\nIf but that will we can arrive to know,\r\n  Nor tamper with the weights of good and ill.\r\n\r\nSo he went forth to battle, on the side\r\n  That he felt clear was Liberty\'s and Right\'s,\r\nAs in his peasant boyhood he had plied\r\n  His warfare with rude nature\'s thwarting mights;--\r\n\r\nThe uncleared forest, the unbroken soil,\r\n  The iron bark that turns the lumberer\'s axe,\r\nThe rapid, that o\'erbears the boatman\'s toil,\r\n  The prairie, hiding the mazed wanderer\'s tracks,\r\n\r\nThe ambushed Indian and the prowling bear--\r\n  Such were the needs that helped his youth to train:\r\nRough culture--but such trees large fruit may bear,\r\n  If but their stocks be of right girth and grain.\r\n\r\nSo he grew up, a destined work to do,\r\n  And lived to do it: four long, suffering years\r\nIll-fate, ill-feeling, ill-report, lived through,\r\n  And then he heard the hisses change to cheers,\r\n\r\nThe taunts to tribute, the abuse to praise,\r\n  And took both with the same unwavering mood;\r\nTill, as he came on light, from darkling days,\r\n  And seemed to touch the goal from where he stood,\r\n\r\nA felon hand, between the goal and him,\r\n  Beached from behind his back, a trigger prest--\r\nAnd those perplexed and patient eyes were dim,\r\n  Those gaunt, long-laboring limbs were laid to rest!\r\n\r\nThe words of mercy were upon his lips,\r\n  Forgiveness in his heart and on his pen,\r\nWhen this vile murderer brought swift eclipse\r\n  To thoughts of peace on earth, goodwill to men.\r\n\r\nThe Old World and the New, from sea to sea,\r\n  Utter one voice of sympathy and shame!\r\nSore heart, so stopped when it at last beat high;\r\n  Sad life, cut short as its triumph came!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Clock on the Stairs\r\n\r\n\r\nSomewhat back from the village street\r\nStands the old-fashioned country-seat;\r\nAcross its antique portico\r\nTall poplar trees their shadows throw;\r\nAnd, from its station in the hall,\r\nAn ancient timepiece says to all,\r\n       "Forever--never!\r\n        Never--forever!"\r\n\r\nHalf-way up the stairs it stands,\r\nAnd points and beckons with its hands,\r\nFrom its case of massive oak,\r\nLike a monk who, under his cloak,\r\nCrosses himself, and sighs, alas!\r\nWith sorrowful voice to all who pass,\r\n       "Forever--never!\r\n        Never--forever!"\r\n\r\nBy day its voice is low and light;\r\nBut in the silent dead of night,\r\nDistinct as a passing footstep\'s fall,\r\nIt echoes along the vacant hall,\r\nAlong the ceiling, along the floor,\r\nAnd seems to say at each chamber door,\r\n       "Forever--never!\r\n        Never--forever!"\r\n\r\nThrough days of sorrow and of mirth,\r\nThrough days of death and days of birth,\r\nThrough every swift vicissitude\r\nOf changeful time, unchanged it has stood,\r\nAnd as if, like God, it all things saw,\r\nIt calmly repeats those words of awe,\r\n       "Forever--never!\r\n        Never--forever!"\r\n\r\nIn that mansion used to be\r\nFree-hearted Hospitality;\r\nHis great fires up the chimney roared;\r\nThe stranger feasted at his board;\r\nBut, like the skeleton at the feast,\r\nThat warning timepiece never ceased,--\r\n       "Forever--never!\r\n        Never--forever!"\r\n\r\nThere groups of merry children played;\r\nThere youths and maidens dreaming strayed;\r\nOh, precious hours! oh, golden prime\r\nAnd affluence of love and time!\r\nEven as a miser counts his gold,\r\nThose hours the ancient timepiece told,--\r\n       "Forever--never!\r\n        Never--forever!"\r\n\r\nFrom that chamber, clothed in white,\r\nThe bride came forth on her wedding night;\r\nThere, in that silent room below,\r\nThe dead lay, in his shroud of snow;\r\nAnd, in the hush that followed the prayer,\r\nWas heard the old clock on the stair,--\r\n       "Forever--never!\r\n        Never--forever!"\r\n\r\nAll are scattered, now, and fled,--\r\nSome are married, some are dead;\r\nAnd when I ask, with throbs of pain,\r\n"Ah! when shall they all meet again?"\r\nAs in the days long since gone by,\r\nThe ancient timepiece makes reply,--\r\n       "Forever--never!\r\n        Never-forever!"\r\n\r\nNever here, forever there,\r\nWhere all parting, pain, and care,\r\nAnd death, and time, shall disappear,--\r\nForever there, but never here!\r\nThe horologe of Eternity\r\nSayeth this incessantly,--\r\n       "Forever--never!\r\n        Never--forever!"\r\n\r\n    _H.W.

Toot-ee! Tudie, tudie! Tu!"\r\n\r\nSix-five, A.M. there\'s a local comes,\r\nMakes up at Bristol, runnin\' east;\r\nAn\' the way her whistle sings and hums\r\nIs a livin\' caution to man and beast.\r\nEvery one knows who Jack White calls,--\r\nLittle Lou Woodbury, down by the falls;\r\nSummer or Winter, always the same,\r\nShe hears her lover callin\' her name--\r\n"Lou-ie! Lou-ie! Lou-iee!"\r\n\r\nBut at one fifty-one, old Sixty-four--\r\nBoston express, runs east, clear through--\r\nDrowns her rattle and rumble and roar\r\nWith the softest whistle that ever blew.\r\nAn\' away on the furthest edge of town\r\nSweet Sue Winthrop\'s eyes of brown\r\nShine like the starlight, bright and clear,\r\nWhen she hears the whistle of Abel Gear,\r\n"You-oo! Su-u-u-u-u-e!"\r\n\r\nAlong at midnight a freight comes in,\r\nLeaves Berlin sometime--I don\'t know when;\r\nBut it rumbles along with a fearful din\r\nTill it reaches the Y-switch there and then\r\nThe clearest notes of the softest bell\r\nThat out of a brazen goblet fell\r\nWake Nellie Minton out of her dreams;\r\nTo her like a wedding-bell it seems--\r\n"Nell, Nell, Nell! Nell, Nell, Nell!"\r\n\r\nTom Willson rides on the right-hand side,\r\nGivin\' her steam at every stride;\r\nAn\' he touches the whistle, low an\' clear,\r\nFor Lulu Gray on the hill, to hear--\r\n"Lu-Lu! Loo-Loo! Loo-oo!"\r\n\r\nSo it goes all day an\' all night\r\nTill the old folks have voted the thing a bore;\r\nOld maids and bachelors say it ain\'t right\r\nFor folks to do courtin\' with such a roar.\r\nBut the engineers their kisses will blow\r\nFrom a whistle valve to the girls they know,\r\nAn\' stokers the name of their sweethearts tell;\r\nWith the "Too-too-too" and the swinging bell.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _R.J.

No, never! flash her eyes with sudden light,\r\nAs she springs and grasps it firmly--"Curfew shall not ring to-night!"\r\n\r\nOut she swung--far out; the city seemed a speck of light below,\r\nThere \'twixt heaven and earth suspended as the bell swung to and fro;\r\nAnd the sexton at the bell-rope, old and deaf, heard not the bell,\r\nSadly thought, "That twilight curfew rang young Basil\'s funeral knell."\r\nStill the maiden clung more firmly, and with trembling lips so white,\r\nSaid, to hush her heart\'s wild throbbing: "Curfew shall not ring to-night."\r\n\r\nIt was o\'er; the bell ceased swaying, and the maiden stepped once more\r\nFirmly on the dark old ladder where, for hundred years before\r\nHuman foot had not been planted.

The vision raised its head,\r\nAnd, with a look made all of sweet accord,\r\nAnswered, "The names of those who love the Lord."\r\n"And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not so,"\r\nReplied the angel.--Abou spoke more low,\r\nBut cheerily still; and said, "I pray thee, then,\r\nWrite me as one that loves his fellow-men."\r\n\r\nThe angel wrote, and vanished.

When you have done\r\n  With woods and cornfields and grazing herds,\r\nA lady, the loveliest ever the sun\r\nLooked down upon you must paint for me:\r\nOh, if I could only make you see\r\n  The clear blue eyes, the tender smile,\r\nThe sovereign sweetness, the gentle grace,\r\nThe woman\'s soul, and the angel\'s face\r\n  That are beaming on me all the while,\r\n  I need not speak these foolish words:\r\n  Yet one word tells you all I would say,--\r\nShe is my mother: you will agree\r\n  That all the rest may be thrown away.\r\n\r\nTwo little urchins at her knee\r\nYou must paint, sir: one like me,--\r\n    The other with a clearer brow,\r\n  And the light of his adventurous eyes\r\n  Flashing with boldest enterprise:\r\nAt ten years old he went to sea,--\r\n    God knoweth if he be living now;\r\n  He sailed in the good ship "Commodore,"--\r\nNobody ever crossed her track\r\nTo bring us news, and she never came back.\r\n  Ah, it is twenty long years and more\r\nSince that old ship went out of the bay\r\n  With my great-hearted brother on her deck:\r\n  I watched him till he shrank to a speck,\r\nAnd his face was toward me all the way.\r\nBright his hair was, a golden brown,\r\n  The time we stood at our mother\'s knee:\r\nThat beauteous head, if it did go down,\r\n  Carried sunshine into the sea!\r\n\r\nOut in the fields one summer night\r\n  We were together, half afraid\r\n  Of the corn-leaves\' rustling, and of the shade\r\n    Of the high hills, stretching so still and far,--\r\nLoitering till after the low little light\r\n  Of the candle shone through the open door,\r\nAnd over the hay-stack\'s pointed top,\r\nAll of a tremble and ready to drop,\r\n    The first half-hoar, the great yellow star,\r\n  That we, with staring, ignorant eyes,\r\nHad often and often watched to see\r\n  Propped and held in its place in the skies\r\nBy the fork of a tall red mulberry-tree,\r\n  Which close in the edge of our flax-field grew,--\r\nDead at the top, just one branch full\r\nOf leaves, notched round, and lined with wool,\r\n  From which it tenderly shook the dew\r\nOver our heads, when we came to play\r\nIn its hand-breadth of shadow, day after day.\r\n  Afraid to go home, sir; for one of us bore\r\nA nest full of speckled and thin-shelled eggs,--\r\nThe other, a bird, held fast by the legs,\r\nNot so big as a straw of wheat:\r\nThe berries we gave her she wouldn\'t eat,\r\nBut cried and cried, till we held her bill,\r\nSo slim and shining, to keep her still.\r\n\r\nAt last we stood at our mother\'s knee.\r\n  Do you think, sir, if you try,\r\n  You can paint the look of a lie?\r\n  If you can, pray have the grace\r\n  To put it solely in the face\r\nOf the urchin that is likest me:\r\n    I think \'twas solely mine, indeed:\r\n  But that\'s no matter,--paint it so;\r\n    The eyes of our mother--(take good heed)--\r\nLooking not on the nestful of eggs,\r\nNor the fluttering bird, held so fast by the legs,\r\nBut straight through our faces down to our lies,\r\nAnd, oh, with such injured, reproachful surprise!\r\nI felt my heart bleed where that glance went, as though\r\nA sharp blade struck through it.\r\n\r\nYou, sir, know\r\nThat you on the canvas are to repeat\r\nThings that are fairest, things most sweet,--\r\nWoods and cornfields and mulberry-tree,--\r\nThe mother,--the lads, with their bird at her knee:\r\n  But, oh, that look of reproachful woe!\r\nHigh as the heavens your name I\'ll shout,\r\nIf you paint me the picture, and leave that out.\r\n\r\n    _Alice Cary._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Won the War?\r\n\r\n\r\n        Who won the war?\r\n\'T was little Belgium stemmed the tide\r\nOf ruthless hordes who thought to ride\r\nHer borders through and prostrate France\r\nEre yet she\'d time to raise her lance.\r\n        \'T was plucky Belgium.\r\n\r\n        Who won the war?\r\nItalia broke the galling chain\r\nWhich bound her to the guilty twain;\r\nThen fought \'gainst odds till one of these\r\nLay prone and shattered at her knees.\r\n        \'T was gallant Italy.\r\n\r\n        Who won the war?\r\nOld England\'s watch dogs of the main\r\nTheir vigil kept, and not in vain;\r\nFor not a ship their wrath dared brave\r\nSave those which skulked beneath the wave.\r\n        \'T was mighty England.\r\n\r\n        Who won the war?\r\n\'T was France who wrote in noble rage\r\nThe grandest words on history\'s page,\r\n"They shall not pass"--the devilish Hun;\r\nAnd he could never pass Verdun.\r\n        \'T was sturdy France.\r\n\r\n        Who won the war?\r\nIn darkest hour there rose a cry,\r\n"Liberty, sweet Liberty, thou shalt not die!"\r\nThank God!

if left on the field he dies."\r\n\r\nThen all the blood that was in me  surged up to my aching brow,\r\nAnd my heart leaped up like a ball in my throat--I can feel it even now,\r\nAnd I said I would bring that boy from the field, if God would spare my\r\n     breath,\r\nIf all the guns in Mission Ridge should thunder the threat of death.\r\n\r\nI crept and crept up the ghastly ridge, by the wounded and the dead,\r\nWith the moans of my comrades right and left, behind me and yet ahead,\r\nTill I came to the form of our Drummer Boy, in his blouse of dusty blue,\r\nWith his face to the foe, \'neath the enemy\'s guns, where the blast of\r\n     the battle blew.\r\n\r\nAnd his gaze as he met my own just there would have melted a heart of\r\n     stone,\r\nAs he tried like a wounded bird to rise, and placed his hand in my own;\r\nAnd he said in a voice half smothered, though its whispering thrills\r\n     me yet,\r\n"I think in a moment more that I would have stood on that parapet.\r\n\r\n"But now I nevermore will climb, and, Sergeant, when you see\r\nThe men go up those breastworks there, just stop and waken me;\r\nFor though I cannot make the charge  and join the cheers that rise,\r\nI may forget my pain to see the old flag kiss the skies."\r\n\r\nWell, it was hard to treat him so, his poor limb shattered sore,\r\nBut I raised him on my shoulder and to the surgeon bore;\r\nAnd the boys who saw us coming each gave a shout of joy,\r\nAnd uttered fervent prayers for him, our valiant Drummer Boy.\r\n\r\nWhen sped the news that "Fighting Joe" had saved the Union right,\r\nWith his legions fresh from Lookout; and that Thomas massed his might\r\nAnd forced the rebel center; and our cheering ran like wild;\r\nAnd Sherman\'s heart was happy as the heart of a little child;\r\n\r\nWhen Grant from his lofty outlook saw our flags by the hundred fly\r\nAlong the slopes of Mission Ridge, where\'er he cast his eye;\r\nAnd when we heard the thrilling news of the mighty battle done,\r\nThe fearful contest ended, and the glorious victory won;\r\n\r\nThen his bright black eyes so yearning grew strangely rapt and wide,\r\nAnd in that hour of conquest our little hero died.\r\nBut ever in our hearts he dwells, with a grace that ne\'er is old,\r\nFor him the heart to duty wed can nevermore grow cold!\r\n\r\nAnd when they tell of heroes, and the laurels they have won,\r\nOf the scars they are doomed to carry, of the deeds that they have done;\r\nOf the horror to be biding among the ghastly dead,\r\nThe gory sod beneath them, the bursting shell o\'erhead,\r\n\r\nMy heart goes back to Mission Ridge and the Drummer Boy who lay\r\nWith his face to the foe, \'neath the enemy\'s guns, in the charge of\r\n     that terrible day;\r\nAnd I say that the land that bears such sons is crowned and dowered\r\n     with all\r\nThe dear God giveth nations to stay them lest they fall.\r\n\r\nOh, glory of Mission Ridge, stream on, like the roseate light of morn,\r\nOn the sons that now are living, on the sons that are yet unborn!\r\nAnd cheers for our comrades living, and tears as they pass away!\r\nAnd three times three for the Drummer Boy who fought at the front that\r\n     day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf--\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you can keep your head when all about you\r\n  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;\r\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\r\n  But make allowance for their doubting too;\r\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\r\n  Or being lied about don\'t deal in lies,\r\nOr being hated don\'t give way to hating,\r\n  And yet don\'t look too good, nor talk too wise;\r\n\r\nIf you can dream and not make dreams your master;\r\n  If you can think and not make thoughts your aim;\r\nIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\r\n  And treat those two impostors just the same;\r\nIf you can bear to hear the truth you\'ve spoken\r\n  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\r\nOr watch the things you gave your life to broken,\r\n  And stoop and build \'em up with worn-out tools;\r\n\r\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings\r\n  And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss.\r\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\r\n  And never breathe a word about your loss;\r\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\r\n  To serve your turn long after they are gone,\r\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you\r\n  Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"\r\n\r\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\r\n  Or walk with Kings nor lose the common touch;\r\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;\r\n  If all men count with you, but none too much;\r\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\r\n  With sixty seconds\' worth of distance run,\r\nYours is the Earth and everything that\'s in it,\r\n  And--which is more--you\'ll be a Man, my son!\r\n\r\n    _Rudyard Kipling._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Table\r\n\r\n\r\nSome boys are mad when comp\'ny comes to stay for meals. They hate\r\nTo have the other people eat while boys must wait and wait,\r\nBut I\'ve about made up my mind I\'m different from the rest,\r\nFor as for me, I b\'lieve I like the second table best.\r\n\r\nTo eat along with comp\'ny is so trying, for it\'s tough\r\nTo sit and watch the victuals when you dassent touch the stuff.\r\nYou see your father serving out the dark meat and the light\r\nUntil a boy is sure he\'ll starve before he gets a bite.\r\n\r\nAnd when, he asks you what you\'ll have,--you\'ve heard it all before,--\r\nYou know you\'ll get just what you get and won\'t get nothing more;\r\nFor, when you want another piece, your mother winks her eye,\r\nAnd so you say, "I\'ve plenty, thanks!" and tell a whopping lie.\r\n\r\nWhen comp\'ny is a-watching you, you\'ve got to be polite,\r\nAnd eat your victuals with a fork and take a little bite.\r\nYou can\'t have nothing till you\'re asked and, \'cause a boy is small,\r\nFolks think he isn\'t hungry, and he\'s never asked at all.\r\n\r\nSince I can first remember I\'ve been told that when the cake\r\nIs passed around, the proper thing is for a boy to take\r\nThe piece that\'s nearest to him, and so all I ever got,\r\nWhen comp\'ny\'s been to our house, was the smallest in the lot.\r\n\r\nIt worries boys like everything to have the comp\'ny stay\r\nA-setting round the table, like they couldn\'t get away.\r\nBut when they\'ve gone, and left the whole big shooting match to me,\r\nSay! ain\'t it fun to just wade in and help myself? Oh, gee!\r\n\r\nWith no one round to notice what you\'re doing--bet your life!--\r\nBoys don\'t use forks to eat with when they\'d rather use a knife,\r\nNor take such little bites as when they\'re eating with the rest\r\nAnd so, for lots of things, I like the second table best\r\n\r\n    _Nixon Waterman._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Children\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the lessons and tasks are all ended,\r\n  And the school for the day is dismissed,\r\nAnd the little ones gather around me,\r\n  To bid me good night and be kissed;\r\nOh, the little white arms that encircle\r\n  My neck in their tender embrace!\r\nOh, the smiles that are halos of heaven,\r\n  Shedding sunshine of love on my face!\r\n\r\nAnd when they are gone, I sit dreaming\r\n  Of my childhood, too lovely to last;\r\nOf love that my heart will remember\r\n  When it wakes to the pulse of the past,\r\nEre the world and its wickedness made me\r\n  A partner of sorrow and sin,--\r\nWhen the glory of God was about me,\r\n  And the glory of gladness within.\r\n\r\nAll my heart grows weak as a woman\'s\r\n  And the fountains of feeling will flow,\r\nWhen I think of the paths steep and stony,\r\n  Where the feet of the dear ones must go;\r\nOf the mountains of sin hanging o\'er them,\r\n  Of the tempest of Fate blowing wild;\r\nOh, there\'s nothing on earth half so holy\r\n  As the innocent heart of a child!\r\n\r\nThey are idols of hearts and of households;\r\n  They are angels of God in disguise;\r\nHis sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,\r\n  His glory still gleams in their eyes;\r\nOh, these truants from home and from heaven,--\r\n  They have made me more manly and mild;\r\nAnd I know now how Jesus could liken\r\n  The kingdom of God to a child!\r\n\r\nI ask not a life for the dear ones\r\n  All radiant, as others have done,\r\nBut that life may have just enough shadow\r\n  To temper the glare of the sun;\r\nI would pray God to guard them from evil,\r\n  But my prayer would bound back to myself;\r\nAh! a seraph may pray for a sinner,\r\n  But a sinner must pray for himself.\r\n\r\nThe twig is so easily bended,\r\n  I have banished the rule and the rod;\r\nI have taught them the goodness of knowledge,\r\n  They have taught me the goodness of God.\r\nMy heart is the dungeon of darkness,\r\n  Where I shut them for breaking a rule;\r\nMy frown is sufficient correction;\r\n  My love is the law of the school.\r\n\r\nI shall leave the old house in the autumn,\r\n  To traverse its threshold no more;\r\nAh! how shall I sigh for the dear ones\r\n  That meet me each morn at the door!\r\nI shall miss the "good nights" and the kisses,\r\n  And the gush of their innocent glee.\r\nThe group on its green, and the flowers\r\n  That are brought every morning to me.\r\n\r\nI shall miss them at morn and at even,\r\n  Their song in the school and the street;\r\nI shall miss the low hum of their voices,\r\n  And the tread of their delicate feet.\r\nWhen the lessons of life are all ended,\r\n  And death says, "The school is dismissed!"\r\nMay the little ones gather around me\r\n  To bid me good night and be kissed!\r\n\r\n    _Charles M.

Moore._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Mission\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you cannot on the ocean\r\n  Sail among the swiftest fleet,\r\nRocking on the highest billows,\r\n  Laughing at the storms you meet,\r\nYou can stand among the sailors,\r\n  Anchored yet within the bay,\r\nYou can lend a hand to help them,\r\n  As they launch their boats away.\r\n\r\nIf you are too weak to journey\r\n  Up the mountain steep and high,\r\nYou can stand within the valley,\r\n  While the multitudes go by;\r\nYou can chant in happy measure,\r\n  As they slowly pass along;\r\nThough they may forget the singer,\r\n  They will not forget the song.\r\n\r\nIf you have not gold and silver\r\n  Ever ready to command,\r\nIf you cannot towards the needy\r\n  Reach an ever-open hand,\r\nYou can visit the afflicted,\r\n  O\'er the erring you can weep,\r\nYou can be a true disciple,\r\n  Sitting at the Savior\'s feet.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot in the conflict,\r\n  Prove yourself a soldier true,\r\nIf where fire and smoke are thickest,\r\n  There\'s no work for you to do,\r\nWhen the battle-field is silent,\r\n  You can go with careful tread,\r\nYou can bear away the wounded,\r\n  You can cover up the dead.\r\n\r\nDo not then stand idly waiting\r\n  For some greater work to do,\r\nFortune is a lazy goddess,\r\n  She will never come to you.\r\nGo and toil in any vineyard,\r\n  Do not fear to do or dare,\r\nIf you want a field of labor,\r\n  You can find it anywhere.\r\n\r\n    _Ellen H.

That, I could not understand.\r\nI heard it at first indistinctly, like the rolling of some muffled drum,\r\nThen nearer and nearer it came to me, till it made my very ears hum;\r\nWhat is this light that surrounds me and seems to set fire to my brain?\r\nWhat whistle\'s that, yelling so shrill? Ah! I know now; it\'s the train.\r\n\r\nWe often stand facing some danger, and seem to take root to the place;\r\nSo I stood--with this demon before me, its heated breath scorching my\r\n     face;\r\nIts headlight made day of the darkness, and glared like the eyes of\r\n     some witch,--\r\nThe train was almost upon me before I remembered the switch.\r\nI sprang to it, seizing it wildly, the train dashing fast down the track;\r\nThe switch resisted my efforts, some devil seemed holding it back;\r\nOn, on came the fiery-eyed monster, and shot by my face like a flash;\r\nI swooned to the earth the next moment, and knew nothing after the crash.\r\n\r\nHow long I lay there unconscious \'twas impossible for me to tell;\r\nMy stupor was almost a heaven, my waking almost a hell,--\r\nFor then I heard the piteous moaning and shrieking of husbands and wives,\r\nAnd I thought of the day we all shrink from, when I must account for\r\n     their lives;\r\nMothers rushed by me like maniacs, their eyes glaring madly and wild;\r\nFathers, losing their courage, gave way to their grief like a child;\r\nChildren searching for parents, I noticed, as by me they sped,\r\nAnd lips, that could form naught but "Mamma," were calling for one\r\n     perhaps dead.\r\n\r\nMy mind was made up in a moment, the river should hide me away,\r\nWhen, under the still burning rafters I suddenly noticed there lay\r\nA little white hand; she who owned it was doubtless an object of love\r\nTo one whom her loss would drive frantic, though she guarded him now\r\n     from above;\r\nI tenderly lifted the rafters and quietly laid them one side;\r\nHow little she thought of her journey when she left for this dark, fatal\r\n     ride!\r\nI lifted the last log from off her, and while searching for some spark\r\n     of life,\r\nTurned her little face up in the starlight, and recognized--Maggie, my\r\n     wife!\r\n\r\nO Lord! my scourge is a hard one, at a blow thou hast shattered my pride;\r\nMy life will be one endless nightmare, with Maggie away from my side.\r\nHow often I\'d sat down and pictured the scenes in our long, happy life;\r\nHow I\'d strive through all my lifetime, to build up a home for my wife;\r\nHow people would envy us always in our cozy and neat little nest;\r\nHow I should do all the labor, and Maggie should all the day rest;\r\nHow one of God\'s blessings might cheer us, how some day I perhaps should\r\n     be rich:--\r\nBut all of my dreams had been shattered, while I lay there asleep at the\r\n     switch!\r\n\r\nI fancied I stood on my trial, the jury and judge I could see;\r\nAnd every eye in the court room was steadily fixed upon me;\r\nAnd fingers were pointed in scorn, till I felt my face blushing blood-red,\r\nAnd the next thing I heard were the words, "Hanged by the neck until\r\n     dead."\r\nThen I felt myself pulled once again, and my hand caught tight hold of a\r\n     dress,\r\nAnd I heard, "What\'s the matter, dear Jim? You\'ve had a bad nightmare, I\r\n     guess!"\r\nAnd there stood Maggie, my wife, with never a scar from the ditch,\r\nI\'d been taking a nap in my bed, and had not been "asleep at the switch."\r\n\r\n    _George Hoey._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach in His Own Tongue\r\n\r\n\r\nA fire-mist and a planet,\r\n  A crystal and a cell,\r\nA jellyfish and a saurian,\r\n  And caves where the cavemen dwell;\r\nThen a sense of law and beauty,\r\n  And a face turned from the clod,--\r\nSome call it Evolution,\r\n  And others call it God.\r\n\r\nA haze in the far horizon,\r\n  The infinite, tender sky;\r\nThe ripe, rich tints of the cornfields,\r\n  And the wild geese sailing high;\r\nAnd all over upland and lowland\r\n  The charm of the goldenrod,--\r\nSome of us call it Nature,\r\n  And others call it God.\r\n\r\nLike tides on a crescent sea-beach,\r\n  When the moon is new and thin,\r\nInto our hearts high yearnings\r\n  Come welling and surging in,--\r\nCome from the mystic ocean.\r\n  Whose rim no foot has trod,--\r\nSome of us call it Longing,\r\n  And others call it God.\r\n\r\nA picket frozen on duty,\r\n  A mother starved for her brood,\r\nSocrates drinking the hemlock,\r\n  And Jesus on the rood;\r\nThe millions who, humble and nameless,\r\n  The straight, hard pathway trod,--\r\nSome call it Consecration,\r\n  And others call it God.\r\n\r\n    _William Herbert Carruth._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Cyrus Laid the Cable\r\n\r\n\r\nCome, listen all unto my song;\r\n  It is no silly fable;\r\n\'Tis all about the mighty cord\r\n  They call the Atlantic Cable.\r\n\r\nBold Cyrus Field he said, says he,\r\n  I have a pretty notion\r\nThat I can run the telegraph\r\n  Across the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThen all the people laughed, and said\r\n  They\'d like to see him do it;\r\nHe might get half-seas over, but\r\n  He never could go through it;\r\n\r\nTo carry out his foolish plan\r\n  He never would be able;\r\nHe might as well go hang himself\r\n  With his Atlantic Cable.\r\n\r\nBut Cyrus was a valiant man,\r\n  A fellow of decision;\r\nAnd heeded not their mocking words,\r\n  Their laughter and derision.\r\n\r\nTwice did his bravest efforts fail,\r\n  And yet his mind was stable;\r\nHe wa\'n\'t the man to break his heart\r\n  Because he broke his cable.\r\n\r\n"Once more, my gallant boys!" he cried;\r\n  "_Three times!_--you know the fable,--\r\n(_I\'ll make it thirty_," muttered he,\r\n  "But I will lay this cable!")\r\n\r\nOnce more they tried--hurrah! hurrah!\r\n  What means this great commotion?\r\nThe Lord be praised! the cable\'s laid\r\n  Across the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nLoud ring the bells,--for, flashing through\r\n  Six hundred leagues of water,\r\nOld Mother England\'s benison\r\n  Salutes her eldest daughter.\r\n\r\nO\'er all the land the tidings speed,\r\n  And soon, in every nation,\r\nThey\'ll hear about the cable with\r\n  Profoundest admiration!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd may we honor evermore\r\n  The manly, bold, and stable;\r\nAnd tell our sons, to make them brave,\r\n  How Cyrus laid the cable.\r\n\r\n    _John G.

shall sit in a golden chair;\r\nThey shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comet\'s hair;\r\nThey shall find real saints to draw from--Magdalene, Peter and Paul;\r\nThey shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all.\r\n\r\nAnd only the Master shall praise us, and only the Master shall blame;\r\nAnd no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame;\r\nBut

Heaven\r\n\r\n\r\nYou\'re surprised that I ever should say so?\r\n  Just wait till the reason I\'ve given\r\nWhy I say I sha\'n\'t care for the music,\r\n  Unless there is whistling in heaven.\r\nThen you\'ll think it no very great wonder,\r\n  Nor so strange, nor so bold a conceit,\r\nThat unless there\'s a boy there a-whistling,\r\n  Its music will not be complete.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the autumn of \'40;\r\n  We had come from our far Eastern home\r\nJust in season to build us a cabin,\r\n  Ere the cold of the winter should come;\r\nAnd we lived all the while in our wagon\r\n  That husband was clearing the place\r\nWhere the house was to stand; and the clearing\r\n  And building it took many days.\r\n\r\nSo that our heads were scarce sheltered\r\n  In under its roof when our store\r\nOf provisions was almost exhausted,\r\n  And husband must journey for more;\r\nAnd the nearest place where he could get them\r\n  Was yet such a distance away,\r\nThat it forced him from home to be absent\r\n  At least a whole night and a day.\r\n\r\nYou see, we\'d but two or three neighbors,\r\n  And the nearest was more than a mile;\r\nAnd we hadn\'t found time yet to know them,\r\n  For we had been busy the while.\r\nAnd the man who had helped at the raising\r\n  Just staid till the job was well done;\r\nAnd as soon as his money was paid him\r\n  Had shouldered his axe and had gone.\r\n\r\nWell, husband just kissed me and started--\r\n  I could scarcely suppress a deep groan\r\nAt the thought of remaining with baby\r\n  So long in the house alone;\r\nFor, my dear, I was childish and timid,\r\n  And braver ones might well have feared,\r\nFor the wild wolf was often heard howling.\r\n  And savages sometimes appeared.\r\n\r\nBut I smothered my grief and my terror\r\n  Till husband was off on his ride,\r\nAnd then in my arms I took Josey,\r\n  And all the day long sat and cried,\r\nAs I thought of the long, dreary hours\r\n  When the darkness of night should fall,\r\nAnd I was so utterly helpless,\r\n  With no one in reach of my call.\r\n\r\nAnd when the night came with its terrors,\r\n  To hide ev\'ry ray of light,\r\nI hung up a quilt by the window,\r\n  And, almost dead with affright,\r\nI kneeled by the side of the cradle,\r\n  Scarce daring to draw a full breath,\r\nLest the baby should wake, and its crying\r\n  Should bring us a horrible death.\r\n\r\nThere I knelt until late in the evening\r\n  And scarcely an inch had I stirred,\r\nWhen suddenly, far in the distance,\r\n  A sound as of whistling I heard.\r\nI started up dreadfully frightened,\r\n  For fear \'twas an Indian\'s call;\r\nAnd then very soon I remembered\r\n  The red man ne\'er whistles at all.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was sure \'twas a white man,\r\n  I thought, were he coming for ill,\r\nHe\'d surely approach with more caution--\r\n  Would come without warning, and still.\r\nThen the sound, coming nearer and nearer,\r\n  Took the form of a tune light and gay,\r\nAnd I knew I needn\'t fear evil\r\n  From one who could whistle that way.\r\n\r\nVery soon I heard footsteps approaching,\r\n  Then came a peculiar dull thump,\r\nAs if some one was heavily striking\r\n  An ax in the top of a stump;\r\nAnd then, in another brief moment,\r\n  There came a light tap on the door,\r\nWhen quickly I undid the fast\'ning,\r\n  And in stepped a boy, and before\r\n\r\nThere was either a question or answer\r\n  Or either had time to speak,\r\nI just threw my glad arms around him,\r\n  And gave him a kiss on the cheek.\r\nThen I started back, scared at my boldness.\r\n  But he only smiled at my fright,\r\nAs he said, "I\'m your neighbor\'s boy, Ellick,\r\n  Come to tarry with you through the night.\r\n\r\n"We saw your husband go eastward,\r\n  And made up our minds where he\'d gone,\r\nAnd I said to the rest of our people,\r\n  \'That woman is there all alone,\r\nAnd I venture she\'s awfully lonesome,\r\n  And though she may have no great fear,\r\nI think she would feel a bit safer\r\n  If only a boy were but near.\'\r\n\r\n"So, taking my axe on my shoulder,\r\n  For fear that a savage might stray\r\nAcross my path and need scalping,\r\n  I started right down this way;\r\nAnd coming in sight of the cabin,\r\n  And thinking to save you alarm,\r\nI whistled a tune, just to show you\r\n  I didn\'t intend any harm.\r\n\r\n"And so here I am, at your service;\r\n  But if you don\'t want me to stay,\r\nWhy, all you need do is to say so,\r\n  And should\'ring my axe, I\'ll away."\r\nI dropped in a chair and near fainted,\r\n  Just at thought of his leaving me then,\r\nAnd his eye gave a knowing bright twinkle\r\n  As he said, "I guess I\'ll remain."\r\n\r\nAnd then I just sat there and told him\r\n  How terribly frightened I\'d been,\r\nHow his face was to me the most welcome\r\n  Of any I ever had seen;\r\nAnd then I lay down with the baby,\r\n  And slept all the blessed night through,\r\nFor I felt I was safe from all danger\r\n  Near so brave a young fellow, and true.\r\n\r\nSo now, my dear friend, do you wonder,\r\n  Since such a good reason I\'ve given,\r\nWhy I say I sha\'n\'t care for the music,\r\n  Unless there is whistling in heaven?\r\nYes, often I\'ve said so in earnest,\r\n  And now what I\'ve said I repeat,\r\nThat unless there\'s a boy there a-whistling,\r\n  Its music will not be complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSleep, Baby, Sleep\r\n\r\n\r\n      Sleep, baby, sleep!\r\nThy father\'s watching the sheep,\r\nThy mother\'s shaking the dreamland tree,\r\nAnd down drops a little dream for thee.\r\n      Sleep, baby, sleep!\r\n\r\n      Sleep, baby, sleep!\r\nThe large stars are the sheep,\r\nThe little stars are the lambs, I guess,\r\nThe bright moon is the shepherdess.\r\n      Sleep, baby, sleep!\r\n\r\n      Sleep, baby, sleep!\r\nThy Savior loves His sheep;\r\nHe is the Lamb of God on high\r\nWho for our sakes came down to die.\r\n      Sleep, baby, sleep!\r\n\r\n    _Elizabeth Prentiss._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lost Chord\r\n\r\n\r\nSeated one day at the organ,\r\n  I was weary and ill at ease,\r\nAnd my fingers wandered idly\r\n  Over the noisy keys.\r\n\r\nI do not know what I was playing,\r\n  Or what I was dreaming then;\r\nBut I struck one chord of music,\r\n  Like the sound of a great Amen.\r\n\r\nIt flooded the crimson twilight,\r\n  Like the close of an angel\'s psalm;\r\nAnd it lay on my fevered spirit\r\n  With a touch of infinite calm.\r\n\r\nIt quieted pain and sorrow,\r\n  Like love overcoming strife;\r\nIt seemed the harmonious echo\r\n  From our discordant life.\r\n\r\nIt linked all perplexing meanings\r\n  Into one perfect peace,\r\nAnd trembled away into silence\r\n  As if it were loth to cease.\r\n\r\nI have sought, but I seek it vainly,\r\n  That one lost chord divine,\r\nThat came from the soul of the organ,\r\n  And entered into mine.\r\n\r\nIt may be that Death\'s bright angel\r\n  Will speak in that chord again;\r\nIt may be that only in Heaven\r\n  I shall hear that grand Amen.\r\n\r\n    _Adelaide A. Procter._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Children\'s Hour\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the dark and the daylight,\r\n  When the night is beginning to lower,\r\nComes a pause in the day\'s occupations,\r\n  That is known as the Children\'s Hour.\r\n\r\nI hear in the chamber above me\r\n  The patter of little feet,\r\nThe sound of a door that is opened,\r\n  And voices soft and sweet.\r\n\r\nFrom my study I see in the lamplight,\r\n  Descending the broad hall stair,\r\nGrave Alice, and laughing Allegra,\r\n  And Edith with golden hair.\r\n\r\nA whisper, and then a silence:\r\n  Yet I know by their merry eyes\r\nThey are plotting and planning together\r\n  To take me by surprise.\r\n\r\nA sudden rush from the stairway,\r\n  A sudden raid from the hall!\r\nBy three doors left unguarded\r\n  They enter my castle wall!\r\n\r\nThey climb up into my turret\r\n  O\'er the arms and back of my chair;\r\nIf I try to escape, they surround me;\r\n  They seem to be everywhere.\r\n\r\nThey almost devour me with kisses,\r\n  Their arms about me entwine,\r\nTill I think of the Bishop of Bingen\r\n  In his Mouse-tower on the Rhine!\r\n\r\nDo you think, O blue-eyed banditti,\r\n  Because you have scaled the wall,\r\nSuch an old mustache as I am\r\n  Is not a match for you all!\r\n\r\nI have you fast in my fortress,\r\n  And will not let you depart,\r\nBut put you down into the dungeon\r\n  In the round-tower of my heart.\r\n\r\nAnd there will I keep you forever,\r\n  Yes, forever and a day,\r\nTill the walls shall crumble to ruin,\r\n  And moulder in dust away!\r\n\r\n    _Henry W.

Now tell me that."\r\n"There is," said he, "and take from me a quiet little tip--\r\nTo go from here to Morrow is a fourteen-hour trip.\r\nThe train that goes to Morrow leaves to-day eight-thirty-five;\r\nHalf after ten to-morrow is the time it should arrive.\r\nNow if from here to Morrow is a fourteen-hour jump,\r\nCan you go to-day to Morrow and come back to-day, you chump?"\r\n\r\nSaid I, "I want to go to Morrow; can I go to-day\r\nAnd get to Morrow by to-night, if there is no delay?"\r\n"Well, well," said he, "explain to me and I\'ve no more to say;\r\nCan you go anywhere to-morrow and come back from there to-day?"\r\nFor if to-day you\'d get to Morrow, surely you\'ll agree\r\nYou should have started not to-day, but yesterday, you see.\r\nSo if you start to Morrow, leaving here to-day, you\'re flat,\r\nYou won\'t get to Morrow till the day that follows that.\r\n\r\n"Now if you start to-day to Morrow, it\'s a cinch you\'ll land\r\nTo-morrow into Morrow, not to-day, you understand.\r\nFor the train to-day to Morrow, if the schedule is right,\r\nWill get you into Morrow by about to-morrow night."\r\nSaid I, "I guess you know it all, but kindly let me say,\r\nHow can I go to Morrow, if I leave the town to-day?"\r\nSaid he, "You cannot go to Morrow any more to-day,\r\nFor the train that goes to Morrow is a mile upon its way."\r\n\r\n\r\nFINALE\r\n\r\nI was so disappointed I was mad enough to swear;\r\nThe train had gone to Morrow and had left me standing there.\r\nThe man was right in telling me I was a howling jay;\r\nI didn\'t go to Morrow, so I guess I\'ll go to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOut in the Fields\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little cares that fretted me,\r\n  I lost them yesterday\r\nAmong the fields above the seas,\r\n  Among the winds at play;\r\nAmong the lowing of the herds,\r\n  The rustling of the trees,\r\nAmong the singing of the birds,\r\n  The humming of the bees.\r\n\r\nThe foolish fears of what might happen,--\r\n  I cast them all away\r\nAmong the clover-scented grass,\r\n   Among the new-mown hay;\r\nAmong the husking of the corn,\r\n  Where drowsy poppies nod,\r\nWhere ill thoughts die and good are born,\r\n  Out in the fields with God.\r\n\r\n    _Elizabeth Barrett Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bluebird\'s Song\r\n\r\n\r\nI know the song that the bluebird is singing,\r\nOut in the apple tree where he is swinging.\r\nBrave little fellow! the skies may be dreary--\r\nNothing cares he while his heart is so cheery.\r\n\r\nHark! how the music leaps out from his throat!\r\nHark! was there ever so merry a note?\r\nListen a while, and you\'ll hear what he\'s saying,\r\nUp in the apple tree swinging and swaying.\r\n\r\n"Dear little blossoms down under the snow,\r\nYou must be weary of winter I know.\r\nListen, I\'ll sing you a message of cheer!\r\nSummer is coming! and springtime is here!\r\n\r\n"Little white snowdrop! I pray you arise;\r\nBright yellow crocus! please open your eyes;\r\nSweet little violets, hid from the cold,\r\nPut on your mantles of purple and gold;\r\nDaffodils! Daffodils! say, do you hear?--\r\nSummer is coming, and springtime is here!"\r\n\r\n    _Emily Huntington Miller._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Main Truck, or a Leap for Life\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Ironsides at anchor lay,\r\n  In the harbor of Mahon;\r\nA dead calm rested on the bay,--\r\n  The waves to sleep had gone;\r\nWhen little Hal, the Captain\'s son,\r\n  A lad both brave and good,\r\nIn sport, up shroud and rigging ran,\r\n  And on the main truck stood!\r\n\r\nA shudder shot through every vein,--\r\n  All eyes were turned on high!\r\nThere stood the boy, with dizzy brain,\r\n  Between the sea and sky;\r\nNo hold had he above, below;\r\n  Alone he stood in air:\r\nTo that far height none dared to go,--\r\n  No aid could reach him there.\r\n\r\nWe gazed, but not a man could speak,--\r\n  With horror all aghast,--\r\nIn groups, with pallid brow and cheek,--\r\n  We watched the quivering mast.\r\nThe atmosphere grew thick and hot,\r\n  And of a lurid hue;--\r\nAs riveted unto the spot,\r\n  Stood officers and crew.\r\n\r\nThe father came on deck:--he gasped,\r\n  "Oh, God; thy will be done!"\r\nThen suddenly a rifle grasped,\r\n  And aimed it at his son.\r\n"Jump, far out, boy, into the wave!\r\n  Jump, or I fire," he said;\r\n"That only chance your life can save;\r\n  Jump, jump, boy!" He obeyed.\r\n\r\nHe sunk,--he rose,--he lived,--he moved,--\r\n  And for the ship struck out.\r\nOn board we hailed the lad beloved,\r\n  With many a manly shout.\r\nHis father drew, in silent joy,\r\n  Those wet arms round his neck,\r\nAnd folded to his heart his boy,--\r\n  Then fainted on the deck.\r\n\r\n    _Morris._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arrow and the Song\r\n\r\n\r\nI shot an arrow into the air,\r\nIt fell to earth, I knew not where;\r\nFor, so swiftly it flew, the sight\r\nCould not follow it in its flight.\r\n\r\nI breathed a song into the air,\r\nIt fell to earth, I knew not where;\r\nFor who has sight so keen and strong,\r\nThat it can follow the flight of song?\r\n\r\nLong, long afterward, in an oak\r\nI found the arrow, still unbroke;\r\nAnd the song, from beginning to end,\r\nI found again in the heart of a friend.\r\n\r\n    _H.W. Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Green Mountain Justice\r\n\r\n\r\n"The snow is deep," the Justice said;\r\n"There\'s mighty mischief overhead."\r\n"High talk, indeed!" his wife exclaimed;\r\n"What, sir! shall Providence be blamed?"\r\nThe Justice, laughing, said, "Oh no!\r\nI only meant the loads of snow\r\nUpon the roofs. The barn is weak;\r\nI greatly fear the roof will break.\r\nSo hand me up the spade, my dear,\r\nI\'ll mount the barn, the roof to clear."\r\n"No!" said the wife; "the barn is high,\r\nAnd if you slip, and fall, and die,\r\nHow will my living be secured?--\r\nStephen, your life is not insured.\r\nBut tie a rope your waist around,\r\nAnd it will hold you safe and sound."\r\n"I will," said he. "Now for the roof--\r\nAll snugly tied, and danger-proof!\r\nExcelsior! Excel--But no!\r\nThe rope is not secured below!"\r\nSaid Rachel, "Climb, the end to throw\r\nAcross the top, and I will go\r\nAnd tie that end around my waist."\r\n"Well, every woman to her taste;\r\nYou always would be tightly laced.\r\nRachel, when you became my bride,\r\nI thought the knot securely tied;\r\nBut lest the bond should break in twain,\r\nI\'ll have it fastened once again."\r\nBelow the arm-pits tied around,\r\nShe takes her station on the ground,\r\nWhile on the roof, beyond the ridge,\r\nHe shovels clear the lower edge.\r\nBut, sad mischance! the loosened snow\r\nComes sliding down, to plunge below.\r\nAnd as he tumbles with the slide,\r\nUp Rachel goes on t\'other side.\r\nJust half-way down the Justice hung;\r\nJust half-way up the woman swung.\r\n"Good land o\' Goshen!" shouted she;\r\n"Why, do you see it?" answered he.\r\n\r\nThe couple, dangling in the breeze,\r\nLike turkeys hung outside to freeze,\r\nAt their rope\'s end and wits\' end, too,\r\nShout back and forth what best to do.\r\nCried Stephen, "Take it coolly, wife;\r\nAll have their ups and downs in life."\r\nQuoth Rachel, "What a pity \'tis\r\nTo joke at such a thing as this!\r\nA man whose wife is being hung\r\nShould know enough to hold his tongue."\r\n"Now, Rachel, as I look below,\r\nI see a tempting heap of snow.\r\nSuppose, my dear, I take my knife,\r\nAnd cut the rope to save my life?"\r\nShe shouted, "Don\'t! \'twould be my death--\r\nI see some pointed stones beneath.\r\nA better way would be to call,\r\nWith all our might, for Phebe Hall."\r\n"Agreed!" he roared. First he, then she\r\nGave tongue; "O Phebe! Phebe! _Phe-e-be_ Hall!" in tones both fine\r\n     and coarse.\r\nEnough to make a drover hoarse.\r\n\r\nNow Phebe, over at the farm,\r\nWas sitting, sewing, snug and warm;\r\nBut hearing, as she thought, her name,\r\nSprang up, and to the rescue came;\r\nBeheld the scene, and thus she thought:\r\n"If now a kitchen chair were brought,\r\nAnd I could reach the lady\'s foot,\r\nI\'d draw her downward by the boot,\r\nThen cut the rope, and let him go;\r\nHe cannot miss the pile of snow."\r\nHe sees her moving toward his wife.\r\nArmed with a chair and carving-knife,\r\nAnd, ere he is aware, perceives\r\nHis head ascending to the eaves;\r\nAnd, guessing what the two are at,\r\nScreams from beneath the roof, "Stop that!\r\nYou make me fall too far, by half!"\r\nBut Phebe answers, with a laugh,\r\n"Please tell a body by what right\r\nYou\'ve brought your wife to such a plight!"\r\nAnd then, with well-directed blows,\r\nShe cuts the rope and down he goes.\r\nThe wife untied, they walk around\r\nWhen lo! no Stephen can be found.\r\nThey call in vain, run to and fro;\r\nThey look around, above, below;\r\nNo trace or token can they see,\r\nAnd deeper grows the mystery.\r\nThen Rachel\'s heart within her sank;\r\nBut, glancing at the snowy bank,\r\nShe caught a little gleam of hope,--\r\nA gentle movement of the rope.\r\nThey scrape away a little snow;\r\nWhat\'s this? A hat! Ah! he\'s below;\r\nThen upward heaves the snowy pile,\r\nAnd forth he stalks in tragic style,\r\nUnhurt, and with a roguish smile;\r\nAnd Rachel sees, with glad surprise,\r\nThe missing found, the fallen rise.\r\n\r\n    _Rev. Henry Reeves._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJane Conquest\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the time of Christmas\r\n  (Not many months ago),\r\n    When the sky was black\r\n    With wrath and rack,\r\n  And the earth was white with snow,\r\nWhen loudly rang the tumult\r\n  Of winds and waves of strife,\r\n    In her home by the sea,\r\n    With her babe on her knee,\r\n  Sat Harry Conquest\'s wife.\r\n\r\nAnd he was on the ocean,\r\n  Although she knew not where,\r\n    For never a lip\r\n    Could tell of the ship,\r\n  To lighten her heart\'s despair.\r\nAnd her babe was fading and dying;\r\n  The pulse in the tiny wrist\r\n    Was all but still,\r\n    And the brow was chill,\r\n  And pale as the white sea mist.\r\n\r\nJane Conquest\'s heart was hopeless;\r\n  She could only weep and pray\r\n    That the Shepherd mild\r\n    Would take her child\r\n  Without a pain away.\r\nThe night was dark and darker,\r\n  And the storm grew stronger still,\r\n    And buried in deep\r\n    And dreamless sleep\r\n  Lay the hamlet under the hill.\r\n\r\nThe fire was dead on the hearthstone\r\n  Within Jane Conquest\'s room,\r\n    And still sat she,\r\n    With her babe on her knee,\r\n  At prayer amid the gloom.\r\nWhen, borne above the tempest,\r\n  A sound fell on her ear,\r\n    Thrilling her through,\r\n    For well she knew\r\n  \'Twas the voice of mortal fear.\r\n\r\nAnd a light leaped in at the lattice,\r\n  Sudden and swift and red;\r\n    Crimsoning all,\r\n    The whited wall,\r\n  And the floor, and the roof o\'erhead.\r\nFor one brief moment, heedless\r\n  Of the babe upon her knee,\r\n    With the frenzied start\r\n    Of a frightened heart,\r\n  Upon her feet rose she.\r\n\r\nAnd through the quaint old casement\r\n  She looks upon the sea;\r\n    Thank God that the sight\r\n    She saw that night\r\n  So rare a sight should be!\r\nHemmed in by many a billow\r\n  With mad and foaming lip,\r\n    A mile from shore,\r\n    Or hardly more,\r\n  She saw a gallant ship.\r\n\r\nAnd to her horror she beheld it\r\n  Aflame from stem to stern;\r\n    For there seemed no speck\r\n    On all that wreck\r\n  Where the fierce fire did not burn;\r\nTill the night was like a sunset,\r\n  And the sea like a sea of blood,\r\n    And the rocks and shore\r\n    Were bathed all o\'er\r\n  And drenched with the gory flood.\r\n\r\nShe looked and looked, till the terror\r\n  Went creeping through every limb;\r\n    And her breath came quick,\r\n    And her heart grew sick,\r\n  And her sight grew dizzy and dim;\r\nAnd her lips had lost their utterance,\r\n  For she tried but could not speak;\r\n    And her feelings found\r\n    No channel of sound\r\n  In prayer, or sob, or shriek.\r\n\r\nOnce more that cry of anguish\r\n  Thrilled through the tempest\'s strife,\r\n    And it stirred again\r\n    In heart and brain\r\n  The active thinking life;\r\nAnd the light of an inspiration\r\n  Leaped to her brightened eye,\r\n    And on lip and brow\r\n    Was written now\r\n  A purpose pure and high.\r\n\r\nSwiftly she turns, and softly\r\n  She crosses the chamber floor,\r\n    And faltering not,\r\n    In his tiny cot\r\n  She laid the babe she bore.\r\nAnd then with a holy impulse,\r\n  She sank to her knees, and made\r\n    A lowly prayer,\r\n    In the silence there,\r\n  And this was the prayer she prayed:\r\n\r\n"O Christ, who didst bear the scourging,\r\n  And who now dost wear the crown,\r\n    I at Thy feet,\r\n    O True and Sweet,\r\n  Would lay my burden down.\r\nThou bad\'st me love and cherish\r\n  The babe Thou gavest me,\r\n    And I have kept\r\n    Thy word, nor stept\r\n  Aside from following Thee.\r\n\r\n"And lo! my boy is dying!\r\n  And vain is all my care;\r\n    And my burden\'s weight\r\n    Is very great,\r\n  Yea, greater than I can bear!\r\nO Lord, Thou know\'st what peril\r\n  Doth threat these poor men\'s lives,\r\n    And I, a woman,\r\n    Most weak and human,\r\n  Do plead for their waiting wives.\r\n\r\n"Thou canst not let them perish;\r\n  Up, Lord, in Thy strength, and save\r\n    From the scorching breath\r\n    Of this terrible death\r\n  On this cruel winter wave.\r\nTake Thou my babe and watch it,\r\n  No care is like to Thine;\r\n    And let Thy power\r\n    In this perilous hour\r\n  Supply what lack is mine."\r\n\r\nAnd so her prayer she ended,\r\n  And rising to her feet,\r\n    Gave one long look\r\n    At the cradle nook\r\n  Where the child\'s faint pulses beat;\r\nAnd then with softest footsteps\r\n  Retrod the chamber floor,\r\n    And noiselessly groped\r\n    For the latch, and oped,\r\n  And crossed the cottage door.\r\n\r\nAnd through the tempest bravely\r\n  Jane Conquest fought her way,\r\n    By snowy deep\r\n    And slippery steep\r\n  To where her duty lay.\r\nAnd she journeyed onward, breathless,\r\n  And weary and sore and faint,\r\n    Yet forward pressed\r\n    With the strength, and the zest,\r\n  And the ardor of a saint.\r\n\r\nSolemn, and weird, and lonely\r\n  Amid its countless graves,\r\n    Stood the old gray church\r\n    On its tall rock perch,\r\n  Secure from the sea and its waves;\r\nAnd beneath its sacred shadow\r\n  Lay the hamlet safe and still;\r\n    For however the sea\r\n    And the wind might be,\r\n  There was quiet under the hill.\r\n\r\nJane Conquest reached the churchyard,\r\n  And stood by the old church door,\r\n    But the oak was tough\r\n    And had bolts enough,\r\n  And her strength was frail and poor;\r\nSo she crept through a narrow window,\r\n  And climbed the belfry stair,\r\n    And grasped the rope,\r\n    Sole cord of hope,\r\n  For the mariners in despair.\r\n\r\nAnd the wild wind helped her bravely,\r\n  And she wrought with an earnest will,\r\n    And the clamorous bell\r\n    Spoke out right well\r\n  To the hamlet under the hill.\r\nAnd it roused the slumbering fishers,\r\n  Nor its warning task gave o\'er\r\n    Till a hundred fleet\r\n    And eager feet\r\n  Were hurrying to the shore.\r\n\r\nAnd then it ceased its ringing,\r\n  For the woman\'s work was done,\r\n    And many a boat\r\n    That was now afloat\r\n  Showed man\'s work had begun.\r\nBut the ringer in the belfry\r\n  Lay motionless and cold,\r\n    With the cord of hope.\r\n    The church-bell rope,\r\n  Still in her frozen hold.\r\n\r\nHow long she lay it boots not,\r\n  But she woke from her swoon at last\r\n    In her own bright room.\r\n    To find the gloom,\r\n  And the grief, and the peril past,\r\nWith the sense of joy within her,\r\n  And the Christ\'s sweet presence near;\r\n    And friends around,\r\n    And the cooing sound\r\n  Of her babe\'s voice in her ear.\r\n\r\nAnd they told her all the story,\r\n  How a brave and gallant few\r\n    O\'ercame each check,\r\n    And reached the wreck,\r\n  And saved the hopeless crew.\r\nAnd how the curious sexton\r\n  Had climbed the belfry stair,\r\n    And of his fright\r\n    When, cold and white,\r\n  He found her lying there;\r\n\r\nAnd how, when they had borne her\r\n  Back to her home again,\r\n    The child she left\r\n    With a heart bereft\r\n  Of hope, and weary with pain,\r\nWas found within his cradle\r\n  In a quiet slumber laid;\r\n    With a peaceful smile\r\n    On his lips the while,\r\n  And the wasting sickness stayed.\r\n\r\nAnd she said "Twas the Christ who watched it,\r\n  And brought it safely through";\r\n    And she praised His truth\r\n    And His tender ruth\r\n  Who had saved her darling too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNathan Hale\r\n\r\n\r\nTo drum beat and heart beat,\r\n  A soldier marches by,\r\nThere is color in his cheek,\r\n  There is courage in his eye;\r\nYet to drum beat and heart beat,\r\n  In a moment he must die.\r\n\r\nBy starlight and moonlight,\r\n  He seeks the Britons\' camp;\r\nHe hears the rustling flag,\r\n  And the armed sentry\'s tramp;\r\nAnd the starlight and moonlight\r\n  His silent wanderings lamp.\r\n\r\nWith a slow tread and still tread,\r\n  He scans the tented line,\r\nAnd he counts the battery guns\r\n  By the gaunt and shadowy pine,\r\nAnd his slow tread and still tread\r\n  Gives no warning sign.\r\n\r\nThe dark wave, the plumed wave,\r\n  It meets his eager glance;\r\nAnd it sparkles \'neath the stars,\r\n  Like the glimmer of a lance--\r\nA dark wave, a plumed wave,\r\n  On an emerald expanse.\r\n\r\nA sharp clang, a steel clang,\r\n  And terror in the sound!\r\nFor the sentry, falcon-eyed,\r\n  In the camp a spy has found;\r\nWith a sharp clang, a steel clang,\r\n  The patriot is bound.\r\n\r\nWith calm brow, steady brow,\r\n  He listens to his doom.\r\nIn his look there is no fear,\r\n  Nor a shadow trace of gloom,\r\nBut with calm brow, steady brow,\r\n  He robes him for the tomb.\r\n\r\nIn the long night, the still night,\r\n  He kneels upon the sod;\r\nAnd the brutal guards withhold\r\n  E\'en the solemn word of God!\r\nIn the long night, the still night,\r\n  He walks where Christ hath trod.\r\n\r\n\'Neath the blue morn, the sunny morn,\r\n  He dies upon the tree;\r\nAnd he mourns that he can give\r\n  But one life for liberty;\r\nAnd in the blue morn, the sunny morn\r\n  His spent wings are free.\r\n\r\nBut his last words, his message words,\r\n  They burn, lest friendly eye\r\nShould read how proud and calm\r\n  A patriot could die.\r\nWith his last words, his dying words,\r\n  A soldier\'s battle cry.\r\n\r\nFrom Fame-leaf and

Finch._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lips That Touch Liquor Must Never Touch Mine\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are coming to woo me, but not as of yore,\r\nWhen I hastened to welcome your ring at the door;\r\nFor I trusted that he who stood waiting me then,\r\nWas the brightest, the truest, the noblest of men.\r\nYour lips on my own when they printed "Farewell,"\r\nHad never been soiled by "the beverage of hell";\r\nBut they come to me now with the bacchanal sign,\r\nAnd the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine.\r\n\r\nI think of that night in the garden alone,\r\nWhen in whispers you told me your heart was my own,\r\nThat your love in the future should faithfully be\r\nUnshared by another, kept only for me.\r\nOh, sweet to my soul is the memory still\r\nOf the lips which met mine, when they murmured "I will";\r\nBut now to their pressure no more they incline,\r\nFor the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine!\r\n\r\nO John! how it crushed me, when first in your face\r\nThe pen of the "Rum Fiend" had written "disgrace";\r\nAnd turned me in silence and tears from that breath\r\nAll poisoned and foul from the chalice of death.\r\nIt scattered the hopes I had treasured to last;\r\nIt darkened the future and clouded the past;\r\nIt shattered my idol, and ruined the shrine,\r\nFor the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine.\r\n\r\nI loved you--Oh, dearer than language can tell,\r\nAnd you saw it, you proved it, you knew it too well!\r\nBut the man of my love was far other than he\r\nWho now from the "Tap-room" comes reeling to me;\r\nIn manhood and honor so noble and right--\r\nHis heart was so true, and his genius so bright--\r\nAnd his soul was unstained, unpolluted by wine;\r\nBut the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine.\r\n\r\nYou promised reform, but I trusted in vain;\r\nYour pledge was but made to be broken again:\r\nAnd the lover so false to his promises now,\r\nWill not, as a husband, be true to his vow.\r\nThe word must be spoken that bids you depart--\r\nThough the effort to speak it should shatter my heart--\r\nThough in silence, with blighted affection, I pine,\r\nYet the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine!\r\n\r\nIf one spark in your bosom of virtue remain,\r\nGo fan it with prayer till it kindle again;\r\nResolved, with "God helping," in future to be\r\nFrom wine and its follies unshackled and free!\r\nAnd when you have conquered this foe of your soul,--\r\nIn manhood and honor beyond his control--\r\nThis heart will again beat responsive to thine,\r\nAnd the lips free from liquor be welcome to mine.\r\n\r\n    _George W. Young._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Perfect Day\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you come to the end of a perfect day\r\n  And you sit alone with your thought\r\nWhile the chimes ring out with a carol gay\r\n  For the joy that the day has brought,\r\nDo you think what the end of a perfect day\r\n  Can mean to a tired heart?\r\nWhen the sun goes down with a flaming ray\r\n  And the dear friends have to part?\r\n\r\nWell, this is the end of a perfect day,\r\n  Near the end of a journey, too;\r\nBut it leaves a thought that is big and strong,\r\n  With a wish that is kind and true;\r\nFor mem\'ry has painted this perfect day\r\n  With colors that never fade,\r\nAnd we find, at the end of a perfect day,\r\n  The soul of a friend we\'ve made.\r\n\r\n    _Carrie Jacobs Bond._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kate Ketchem_\r\n\r\n\r\nKate Ketchem on a winter\'s night\r\nWent to a party dressed in white.\r\nHer chignon in a net of gold,\r\nWas about as large as they ever sold.\r\nGayly she went, because her "pap"\r\nWas supposed to be a rich old chap.\r\n\r\nBut when by chance her glances fell\r\nOn a friend who had lately married well,\r\nHer spirits sunk, and a vague unrest\r\nAnd a nameless longing filled her breast--\r\nA wish she wouldn\'t have had made known,\r\nTo have an establishment of her own.\r\n\r\nTom Fudge came slowly through the throng,\r\nWith chestnut hair, worn pretty long.\r\nHe saw Kate Ketchem in the crowd,\r\nAnd knowing her slightly, stopped and bowed;\r\nThen asked her to give him a single flower,\r\nSaying he\'d think it a priceless dower.\r\n\r\nOut from those with which she was decked,\r\nShe took the poorest she could select.\r\nAnd blushed as she gave it, looking down\r\nTo call attention to her gown.\r\n"Thanks," said Fudge, and he thought how dear\r\nFlowers must be at that time of year.\r\n\r\nThen several charming remarks he made,\r\nAsked if she sang, or danced, or played;\r\nAnd being exhausted, inquired whether\r\nShe thought it was going to be pleasant weather.\r\nAnd Kate displayed her "jewelry,"\r\nAnd dropped her lashes becomingly;\r\nAnd listened, with no attempt to disguise\r\nThe admiration in her eyes.\r\nAt last, like one who has nothing to say,\r\nHe turned around and walked away.\r\n\r\nKate Ketchem smiled, and said, "You bet.\r\nI\'ll catch that Fudge and his money yet.\r\nHe\'s rich enough to keep me in clothes,\r\nAnd I think I could manage him as I chose.\r\nHe could aid my father as well as not,\r\nAnd buy my brother a splendid yacht.\r\nMy mother for money should never fret,\r\nAnd all it cried for the baby should get;\r\nAnd after that, with what he could spare,\r\nI\'d make a show at a charity fair."\r\n\r\nTom Fudge looked back as he crossed the sill,\r\nAnd saw Kate Ketchem standing still.\r\n"A girl more suited to my mind\r\nIt isn\'t an easy thing to find;\r\nAnd every thing that she has to wear\r\nProves her as rich as she is fair.\r\nWould she were mine, and I to-day\r\nHad the old man\'s cash my debts to pay!\r\nNo creditors with a long account,\r\nNo tradesmen wanting \'that little amount\';\r\nBut all my scores paid up when due\r\nBy a father-in-law as rich as a Jew!"\r\n\r\nBut he thought of her brother, not worth a straw,\r\nAnd her mother, that would be his, in law;\r\nSo, undecided, he walked along,\r\nAnd Kate was left alone in the throng.\r\nBut a lawyer smiled, whom he sought by stealth,\r\nTo ascertain old Ketchem\'s wealth;\r\nAnd as for Kate, she schemed and planned\r\nTill one of the dancers claimed her hand.\r\n\r\nHe married her for her father\'s cash;\r\nShe married him to cut a dash,\r\nBut as to paying his debts, do you know,\r\nThe father couldn\'t see it so;\r\nAnd at hints for help, Kate\'s hazel eyes\r\nLooked out in their innocent surprise.\r\nAnd when Tom thought of the way he had wed\r\nHe longed for a single life instead,\r\nAnd closed his eyes in a sulky mood,\r\nRegretting the days of his bachelorhood;\r\nAnd said, in a sort of reckless vein,\r\n"I\'d like to see her catch me again,\r\nIf I were free, as on that night\r\nWhen I saw Kate Ketchem dressed in white!"\r\n\r\nShe wedded him to be rich and gay;\r\nBut husband and children didn\'t pay,\r\nHe wasn\'t the prize she hoped to draw,\r\nAnd wouldn\'t live with his mother-in-law.\r\nAnd oft when she had to coax and pout\r\nIn order to get him to take her out,\r\nShe thought how very attentive and bright\r\nHe seemed at the party that winter\'s night;\r\nOf his laugh, as soft as a breeze of the south,\r\n(\'Twas now on the other side of his mouth);\r\nHow he praised her dress and gems in his talk,\r\nAs he took a careful account of stock.\r\n\r\nSometimes she hated the very walls--\r\nHated her friends, her dinners, and calls;\r\nTill her weak affection, to hatred turned,\r\nLike a dying tallow-candle burned.\r\nAnd for him who sat there, her peace to mar,\r\nSmoking his everlasting cigar--\r\nHe wasn\'t the man she thought she saw,\r\nAnd grief was duty, and hate was law.\r\nSo she took up her burden with a groan,\r\nSaying only, "I might have known!"\r\n\r\nAlas for Kate! and alas for Fudge!\r\nThough I do not owe them any grudge;\r\nAnd alas for any who find to their shame\r\nThat two can play at their little game!\r\nFor of all hard things to bear and grin,\r\nThe hardest is knowing you\'re taken in.\r\nAh, well! as a general thing, we fret\r\nAbout the one we didn\'t get;\r\nBut I think we needn\'t make a fuss,\r\nIf the one we don\'t want didn\'t get us.\r\n\r\n    _Phoebe

on!\'"\r\n\r\n"My men grow mutinous day by day;\r\n  My men grow ghastly wan and weak."\r\nThe stout mate thought of home; a spray\r\n  Of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek,\r\n"What shall I say,

blow,\r\n  Until at last the blanched mate said:\r\n"Why, now not even God would know\r\n  Should I and all my men fall dead.\r\nThese very winds forget their way,\r\n  For God from these dread seas is gone.\r\nNow speak, brave Adm\'r\'l, speak and say--"\r\n  He said: "Sail on! Sail on! and on!"\r\n\r\nThey sailed. They sailed. Then spake the mate:\r\n  "This mad sea shows his teeth tonight.\r\nHe curls his lips, he lies in wait\r\n  With lifted teeth, as if to bite!\r\nBrave Adm\'r\'l, say but one good word:\r\n  What shall we do when hope is gone?\r\nThe words leapt like a leaping sword;\r\n  "Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!"\r\n\r\nThen, pale and worn, he kept his deck,\r\n  And peered through darkness.

where the sun\'s a little brighter,\r\nWhere the snow that falls is a trifle whiter,\r\nWhere the bonds of home are a wee bit tighter,\r\n  That\'s where the West begins.\r\n\r\nOut where the skies are a trifle bluer,\r\nOut where friendship\'s a little truer,\r\n  That\'s where the West begins.\r\nOut where a fresher breeze is blowing,\r\nWhere there is laughter in every streamlet flowing,\r\nWhere there\'s more of reaping and less of sowing,\r\n  That\'s where the West begins.\r\n\r\nOut where the world is in the making,\r\nWhere fewer hearts with despair are aching;\r\n  That\'s where the West begins.\r\nWhere there is more of singing and less of sighing,\r\nWhere there is more of giving and less of buying,\r\nAnd a man makes friends without half trying--\r\n  That\'s

weavers on the other side of the sea.\r\nAbove their heads the pattern hangs, they study it with care,\r\nThe while their fingers deftly move, their eyes are fastened there.\r\n\r\nThey tell this curious thing, besides, of the patient, plodding weaver:\r\nHe works on the wrong side evermore, but works for the right side ever.\r\nIt is only when the weaving stops, and the web is loosed and turned,\r\nThat he sees his real handiwork--that his marvelous skill is learned.\r\n\r\nAh, the sight of its delicate beauty, how it pays him for all his cost!\r\nNo rarer, daintier work than his was ever done by the frost.\r\nThen the master bringeth him golden hire, and giveth him praise as well,\r\nAnd how happy the heart of the weaver is, no tongue but his can tell.\r\n\r\nThe years of man are the looms of God, let down from the place of the sun,\r\nWherein we are weaving ever, till the mystic web is done.\r\nWeaving blindly but weaving surely each for himself his fate--\r\nWe may not see how the right side looks, we can only weave and wait.\r\n\r\nBut, looking above for the pattern, no weaver hath to fear;\r\nOnly let him look clear into heaven, the Perfect Pattern is there.\r\nIf he keeps the face of the Savior forever and always in sight\r\nHis toil shall be sweeter than honey, his weaving sure to be right.\r\n\r\nAnd when the work is ended, and the web is turned and shown,\r\nHe shall hear the voice of the Master, it shall say unto him, "Well done!"\r\nAnd the white-winged Angels of Heaven, to bear him shall come down;\r\nAnd God shall give him gold for his hire--not a coin--but a glowing crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Teacher Gets Cross\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the teacher gets cross, and her blue eyes gets black,\r\nAnd the pencil comes down on the desk with a whack,\r\nWe chillen all sit up straight in a line,\r\nAs if we had rulers instead of a spine,\r\nAnd it\'s scary to cough, and it a\'n\'t safe to grin,\r\nWhen the teacher gets cross, and the dimples goes in.\r\n\r\nWhen the teacher gets cross, the tables get mixed,\r\nThe ones and the twos begins to play tricks.\r\nThe pluses and minuses is just little smears,\r\nWhen the cry babies cry their slates full of tears,\r\nAnd the figgers won\'t add,--but just act up like sin,\r\nWhen the teacher gets cross, and the dimples goes in.\r\n\r\nWhen the teacher gets cross, the reading gets bad.\r\nThe lines jingle round till the\' chillen is sad.\r\nAnd Billy boy puffs and gets red in the face,\r\nAs if he and the lesson were running a race,\r\nUntil she hollers out, "Next!" as sharp as a pin,\r\nWhen the teacher gets cross, and the dimples goes in.\r\n\r\nWhen the teacher gets good, her smile is so bright,\r\nThat the tables gets straight, and the reading gets right.\r\nThe pluses and minuses comes trooping along,\r\nAnd the figgers add up and stop being wrong,\r\nAnd we chillen would like, but we dassent, to shout,\r\nWhen the teacher gets good, and the dimples comes out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecessional\r\n\r\n\r\nGod of our fathers, known of old,\r\n  Lord of our far-flung battle line,\r\nBeneath whose awful Hand we hold\r\n  Dominion over palm and pine--\r\nLord

humble and a contrite heart.\r\nLord God of Hosts, be with us yet,\r\nLest we forget--lest we forget!\r\n\r\nFar-called, our navies melt away;\r\n  On dune and headland sinks the fire:\r\nLo, all our pomp of yesterday\r\n  Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!\r\nJudge of the Nations, spare us yet,\r\nLest we forget--lest we forget!\r\n\r\nIf, drunk with sight of power, we loose\r\n  Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe--\r\nSuch boasting as the Gentiles use,\r\n  Or lesser breeds without the Law--\r\nLord God of Hosts, be with us yet,\r\nLest we forget--lest we forget!\r\n\r\nFor heathen heart that puts her trust\r\n  In reeking tube and iron shard,\r\nAll valiant dust that builds on dust,\r\n  And guarding, calls not Thee to guard,\r\nFor frantic boast and foolish word,\r\nThy Mercy on Thy People, Lord!\r\n\r\n                               Amen.\r\n\r\n    _Rudyard Kipling._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eternal Goodness\r\n\r\n\r\nO Friends! with whom my feet have trod\r\n  The quiet aisles

fears a doubt as wrong.\r\n\r\nBut still my human hands are weak\r\n  To hold your iron creeds:\r\nAgainst the words ye bid me speak\r\n  My heart within me pleads.\r\n\r\nWho fathoms the Eternal

I know;\r\nToo dark ye cannot paint the sin,\r\n  Too small the merit show.\r\n\r\nI bow my forehead to the dust,\r\n  I veil mine eyes for shame,\r\nAnd urge, in trembling self-distrust,\r\n  A prayer without a claim.\r\n\r\nI see the wrong that round me lies,\r\n  I feel the guilt within;\r\nI hear, with groan and travail-cries,\r\n  The world confess its sin.\r\n\r\nYet, in the maddening maze of things,\r\n  And tossed by storm and flood,\r\nTo one fixed stake my spirit clings;\r\n  I know that God is good!\r\n\r\nNot mine to look where cherubim\r\n  And seraphs may not see,\r\nBut nothing can be good in Him\r\n  Which evil is in me.\r\n\r\nThe wrong that pains my soul below\r\n  I dare not throne above;\r\nI know not of His hate,--I know\r\n  His goodness and His love.\r\n\r\nI dimly guess from blessings known\r\n  Of greater out of sight,\r\nAnd, with the chastened Psalmist, own\r\n  His judgments too are right.\r\n\r\nI long for household voices gone,\r\n  For vanished smiles I long,\r\nBut God hath led my dear ones on,\r\n  And he can do no wrong.\r\n\r\nI know not what the future hath\r\n  Of marvel or surprise,\r\nAssured alone that life and death\r\n  His mercy underlies.\r\n\r\nAnd if my heart and flesh are weak\r\n  To bear an untried pain,\r\nThe bruised reed He will not break,\r\n  But strengthen and sustain.\r\n\r\nNo offering of my own I have,\r\n  Nor works my faith to prove;\r\nI can but give the gifts He gave,\r\n  And plead His love for love.\r\n\r\nAnd so beside the Silent Sea,\r\n  I wait the muffled oar;\r\nNo harm from Him can come to me\r\n  On ocean or on shore.\r\n\r\nI know not where His islands lift\r\n  Their fronded palms in air;\r\nI only know I cannot drift\r\n  Beyond His love and care.\r\n\r\nO brothers! if my faith is vain,\r\n  If hopes like these betray,\r\nPray for me that my feet may gain\r\n  The sure and safer way.\r\n\r\nAnd Thou, O Lord! by whom are seen\r\n  Thy creatures as they be,\r\nForgive me if too close I lean\r\n  My human heart on Thee!\r\n\r\n    _John G.

He, the bold rider,\r\n  Custer, our hero, the first in the fight,\r\nCharming the bullets of yore to fly wider,\r\n  Shunning our battle-king\'s ringlets of light!\r\nDead! our young chieftain, and dead all forsaken!\r\n  No one to tell us the way of his fall!\r\nSlain in the desert, and never to waken,\r\n  Never, not even to victory\'s call!\r\n\r\nComrades, he\'s gone! but ye need not be grieving;\r\n  No, may my death be like his when I die!\r\nNo regrets wasted on words I am leaving,\r\n  Falling with brave men, and face to the sky.\r\nDeath\'s but a journey, the greatest must take it:\r\n  Fame is eternal, and better than all;\r\nGold though the bowl be, \'tis fate that must break it,\r\n  Glory can hallow the fragments that fall.\r\n\r\nProud for his fame that last day that he met them!\r\n  All the night long he had been on their track,\r\nScorning their traps and the men that had set them,\r\n  Wild for a charge that should never give back.\r\nThere, on the hilltop he halted and saw them--\r\n  Lodges all loosened and ready to fly;\r\nHurrying scouts with the tidings to awe them,\r\n  Told of his coming before he was nigh.\r\n\r\nAll the wide valley was full of their forces,\r\n  Gathered to cover the lodges\' retreat,--\r\nWarriors running in haste to their horses,\r\n  Thousands of enemies close to his feet!\r\nDown in the valleys the ages had hollowed,\r\n  There lay the Sitting Bull\'s camp for a prey!\r\nNumbers! What recked he? What recked those who followed?\r\n  Men who had fought ten to one ere that day?\r\n\r\nOut swept the squadrons, the fated three hundred,\r\n  Into the battle-line steady and full;\r\nThen down the hillside exultingly thundered\r\n  Into the hordes of the Old Sitting Bull!\r\nWild Ogalallah, Arapahoe, Cheyenne,\r\n  Wild Horse\'s braves, and the rest of their crew,\r\nShrank from that charge like a herd from a lion.\r\n  Then closed around the great hell of wild Sioux.\r\n\r\nRight to their center he charged, and then, facing--\r\n  Hark to those yells and around them, Oh, see!\r\nOver the hilltops the devils come racing,\r\n  Coming as fast as the waves of the sea!\r\nRed was the circle of fire about them,\r\n  No hope of victory, no ray of light,\r\nShot through that terrible black cloud about them,\r\n  Brooding in death over Custer\'s last fight.\r\n\r\nTHEN DID HE BLENCH? Did he die like a craven,\r\n  Begging those torturing fiends for his life?\r\nWas there a soldier who carried the Seven\r\n  Flinched like a coward or fled from the strife?\r\nNo, by the blood of our Custer, no quailing!\r\n  There in the midst of the devils they close,\r\nHemmed in by thousands, but ever assailing,\r\n  Fighting like tigers, all bayed amid foes!\r\n\r\nThicker and thicker the bullets came singing;\r\n  Down go the horses and riders and all;\r\nSwiftly the warriors round them were ringing,\r\n  Circling like buzzards awaiting their fall.\r\nSee the wild steeds of the mountain and prairie,\r\n  Savage eyes gleaming from forests of mane;\r\nQuivering lances with pennons so airy;\r\n  War-painted warriors charging amain.\r\n\r\nBackward again and again they were driven,\r\n  Shrinking to close with the lost little band;\r\nNever a cap that had worn the bright Seven\r\n  Bowed till its wearer was dead on the strand.\r\nCloser and closer the death-circle growing,\r\n  Even the leader\'s voice, clarion clear,\r\nRang out his words of encouragement glowing,\r\n  "We can but die once, boys, but SELL YOUR LIVES DEAR!"\r\n\r\nDearly they sold them, like Berserkers raging,\r\n  Facing the death that encircled them round;\r\nDeath\'s bitter pangs by their vengeance assuaging,\r\n  Marking their tracks by their dead on the ground.\r\nComrades, our children shall yet tell their story,--\r\n  Custer\'s last charge on the Old Sitting Bull;\r\nAnd ages shall swear that the cup of his glory\r\n  Needed but that death to render it full.\r\n\r\n  _Frederick Whitttaker._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Boy and His Stomach\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\'s the matter, stummick?

for,\r\nAnd what was his job to do.\r\n\r\nEvery one of you won the war,\r\nObedient, unwearied, unknown,\r\nDung in the trenches, drift on the shore,\r\nDust to the world\'s end blown;\r\nEvery one of you, steady and true,\r\nYou and you and you--\r\nDown in the pit or up in the blue,\r\nWhether you crawled or sailed or flew,\r\nWhether your closest comrade knew\r\nOr you bore the brunt alone--\r\n\r\nAll of you, all of you, name after name,\r\nJones and Robinson, Smith and Brown,\r\nYou from the piping prairie town,\r\nYou from the Fundy fogs that came,\r\nYou from the city\'s roaring blocks,\r\nYou from the bleak New England rocks\r\nWith the shingled roof in the apple boughs,\r\nYou from the brown adobe house--\r\nYou from the Rockies, you from the Coast,\r\nYou from the burning frontier-post\r\nAnd you from the Klondyke\'s frozen flanks,\r\nYou from the cedar-swamps, you from the pine,\r\nYou from the cotton and you from the vine,\r\nYou from the rice and the sugar-brakes,\r\nYou from the Rivers and you from the Lakes,\r\nYou from the Creeks and you from the Licks\r\nAnd you from the brown bayou--\r\nYou and you and you--\r\nYou from the pulpit, you from the mine,\r\nYou from the factories, you from the banks,\r\nCloser and closer, ranks on ranks,\r\nAirplanes and cannon, and rifles and tanks,\r\nSmith and Robinson, Brown and Jones,\r\nRuddy faces or bleaching bones,\r\nAfter the turmoil and blood and pain\r\nSwinging home to the folks again\r\nOr sleeping alone in the fine French rain--\r\nEvery one of you won the war.\r\n\r\nEvery one of you won the war--\r\nYou and you and you--\r\nPressing and pouring forth, more and more,\r\nToiling and straining from shore to shore\r\nTo reach the flaming edge of the dark\r\nWhere man in his millions went up like a spark,\r\nYou, in your thousands and millions coming,\r\nAll the sea ploughed with you, all the air humming,\r\nAll the land loud with you,\r\nAll our hearts proud with you,\r\nAll our souls bowed with the awe of your coming!\r\n\r\nWhere\'s the Arch high enough,\r\nLads, to receive you,\r\nWhere\'s the eye dry enough,\r\nDears, to perceive you,\r\nWhen at last and at last in your glory you come,\r\nTramping home?\r\n\r\nEvery one of you won the war,\r\nYou and you and you--\r\nYou that carry an unscathed head,\r\nYou that halt with a broken tread,\r\nAnd oh, most of all, you Dead, you Dead!\r\nLift up the Gates for these that are last,\r\nThat are last in the great Procession.\r\nLet the living pour in, take possession,\r\nFlood back to the city, the ranch, the farm,\r\nThe church and the college and mill,\r\nBack to the office, the store, the exchange,\r\nBack to the wife with the babe on her arm,\r\nBack to the mother that waits on the sill,\r\nAnd the supper that\'s hot on the range.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when the last of them all are by,\r\nBe the Gates lifted up on high\r\n  To let those Others in,\r\nThose Others, their brothers, that softly tread,\r\nThat come so thick, yet take no ground,\r\nThat are so many, yet make no sound,\r\nOur Dead, our Dead, our Dead!\r\n\r\nO silent and secretly-moving throng,\r\nIn your fifty thousand strong,\r\nComing at dusk when the wreaths have dropt,\r\nAnd streets are empty, and music stopt,\r\nSilently coming to hearts that wait\r\nDumb in the door and dumb at the gate,\r\nAnd hear your step and fly to your call--\r\nEvery one of you won the war,\r\nBut you, you Dead, most of all!\r\n\r\n_Edith Wharton (Copyright 1919 by Charles Scrihner\'s, Sons)._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Snow-fall\r\n\r\n\r\nThe snow had begun in the gloaming,\r\n  And busily all the night\r\nHad been heaping field and highway\r\n  With a silence deep and white.\r\n\r\nEvery pine and fir and hemlock\r\n  Wore ermine too dear for an earl,\r\nAnd the poorest twig on the elm tree\r\n  Was ridged inch-deep with pearl.\r\n\r\nFrom sheds new-roofed with Carrara\r\n  Came Chanticleer\'s muffled crow,\r\nThe stiff rails were softened to swan\'s-down,\r\n  And still fluttered down the snow.\r\n\r\nI stood and watched by the window\r\n  The noiseless work of the sky,\r\nAnd the sudden flurries of snow-birds,\r\n  Like brown leaves whirling by.\r\n\r\nI thought of a mound in sweet Auburn\r\n  Where a little headstone stood;\r\nHow the flakes were folding it gently,\r\n  As did robins the babes in the wood.\r\n\r\nUp spoke our own little Mabel,\r\n  Saying, "Father, who makes it snow?"\r\nAnd I told of the good All-father\r\n  Who cares for us here below.\r\n\r\nAgain I looked at the snow-fall,\r\n  And thought of the leaden sky\r\nThat arched o\'er our first great sorrow,\r\n  When that mound was heaped so high.\r\n\r\nI remembered the gradual patience\r\n  That fell from that cloud like snow,\r\nFlake by flake, healing and hiding\r\n  The scar of our deep-plunged woe.\r\n\r\nAnd again to the child I whispered,\r\n  "The snow that husheth all,\r\nDarling, the merciful Father\r\n  Alone can make it fall!"\r\n\r\nThen, with eyes that saw not, I kissed her;\r\n  And she, kissing back, could not know\r\nThat _my_ kiss was given to her sister,\r\n  Folded close under deepening snow.\r\n\r\n    _James Russell Lowell._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Concord Hymn\r\n\r\n_Sung at the completion of the Concord Monument, April 19, 1836_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the rude bridge that arched the flood,\r\n  Their flag to April\'s breeze unfurled,\r\nHere once the embattled farmers stood,\r\n  And fired the shot heard round the world.\r\n\r\nThe foe long since in silence slept;\r\n  Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;\r\nAnd Time the ruined bridge has swept\r\n  Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.\r\n\r\nOn this green bank, by this soft stream,\r\n  We set to-day a votive stone,\r\nThat memory may their deed redeem,\r\n  When, like our sires, our sons are gone.\r\n\r\nSpirit, that made these heroes dare\r\n  To die, to leave their children free,\r\nBid Time and Nature gently spare\r\n  The shaft we raise to them and thee.\r\n\r\n    _Ralph Waldo Emerson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCasey at the Bat\r\n\r\n\r\nIt looked extremely rocky for the Mudville nine that day;\r\nThe score stood two to four with but an inning left to play;\r\nSo, when Cooney died at second, and Burrows did the same,\r\nA pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game.\r\n\r\nA straggling few got up to go, leaving there the rest,\r\nWith that hope which springs eternal within the human breast,\r\nFor they thought: "If only Casey could get a whack at that,"\r\nThey\'d put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.\r\n\r\nBut Flynn preceded Casey, and likewise so did Blake,\r\nAnd the former was a puddin\', and the latter was a fake;\r\nSo on that stricken multitude a deathlike silence sat.\r\nFor there seemed but little chance of Casey\'s getting to the bat,\r\n\r\nBut Flynn let drive a "single," to the wonderment of all,\r\nAnd the much-despised Blakey "tore the cover off the ball";\r\nAnd when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred,\r\nThere was Blakey safe at second, and Flynn a-huggin\' third.\r\n\r\nThen, from the gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell,\r\nIt rumbled in the mountain-tops, it rattled in the dell;\r\nIt struck upon the hillside and rebounded on the flat;\r\nFor Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.\r\n\r\nThere was ease in Casey\'s manner as he stepped into his place,\r\nThere was pride in Casey\'s bearing, and a smile on Casey\'s face.\r\nAnd when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,\r\nNo stranger in the crowd could doubt \'twas Casey at the bat.\r\n\r\nTen thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt,\r\nFive thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;\r\nThen while the New York pitcher ground the ball into his hip,\r\nDefiance gleamed in Casey\'s eye, a sneer curled Casey\'s lip.\r\n\r\nAnd now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,\r\nAnd Casey stood a-watching it in  haughty grandeur there.\r\nClose by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped--\r\n"That ain\'t my style," said Casey. "Strike one," the umpire said.\r\n\r\nFrom the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,\r\nLike the beating of great storm waves on a stern and distant shore.\r\n"Kill him! Kill the umpire!" shouted someone on the stand.\r\nAnd it\'s likely they\'d have killed him had not Casey raised a hand.\r\n\r\nWith a smile of Christian charity great Casey\'s visage shone;\r\nHe stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;\r\nHe signaled to Sir Timothy, once more the spheroid flew;\r\nBut Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, "Strike two."\r\n\r\n"Fraud," cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered "Fraud!"\r\nBut one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.\r\nThey saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,\r\nAnd they knew that Casey wouldn\'t let that ball go by again.\r\n\r\nThe sneer is gone from Casey\'s lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;\r\nHe pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;\r\nAnd now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,\r\nAnd now the air is shattered by the force of Casey\'s blow.\r\n\r\nOh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;\r\nThe band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;\r\nAnd somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout:\r\nBut there is no joy in Mudville--mighty Casey has struck out.\r\n\r\n    _Phineas Thayer._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCasey\'s Revenge\r\n\r\n_(Being a reply to "Casey at the Bat.")_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were saddened hearts in Mudville for a week or even more;\r\nThere were muttered oaths and curses--every fan in town was sore.\r\n"Just think," said one, "how soft it looked with Casey at the bat!\r\nAnd then to think he\'d go and spring a bush league trick like that."\r\n\r\nAll his past fame was forgotten; he was now a hopeless "shine."\r\nThey called him "Strike-out Casey" from the mayor down the line.\r\nAnd as he came to bat each day his bosom heaved a sigh,\r\nWhile a look of hopeless fury shone in mighty Casey\'s eye.\r\n\r\nThe lane is long, someone has said, that never turns again,\r\nAnd Fate, though fickle, often gives another chance to men.\r\nAnd Casey smiled--his rugged face no longer wore a frown;\r\nThe pitcher who had started all the trouble came to town.\r\n\r\nAll Mudville has assembled; ten thousand fans had come\r\nTo see the twirler who had put big Casey on the bum;\r\nAnd when he stepped into the box the multitude went wild.\r\nHe doffed his cap in proud disdain--but Casey only smiled.\r\n\r\n"Play ball!" the umpire\'s voice rang out, and then the game began;\r\nBut in that throng of thousands there was not a single fan\r\nWho thought that Mudville had a chance; and with the setting sun\r\nTheir hopes sank low--the rival team was leading "four to one."\r\n\r\nThe last half of the ninth came round, with no change in the score;\r\nBut when the first man up hit safe the crowd began to roar.\r\nThe din increased, the echo of ten thousand shouts was heard\r\nWhen the pitcher hit the second and gave "four balls" to the third.\r\n\r\nThree men on base--nobody out--three runs to tie the game!\r\nA triple meant the highest niche in Mudville\'s hall of fame.\r\nBut here the rally ended and the gloom was deep as night\r\nWhen the fourth one "fouled to catcher," and the fifth "flew out to right."\r\n\r\nA dismal groan in chorus came--a scowl was on each face--\r\nWhen Casey walked up, bat in hand, and slowly took his place;\r\nHis bloodshot eyes in fury gleamed; his teeth were clinched in hate;\r\nHe gave his cap a vicious hook and pounded on the plate.\r\n\r\nBut fame is fleeting as the wind, and glory fades away;\r\nThere were no wild and woolly cheers, no glad acclaim this day.\r\nThey hissed and groaned and hooted as they clamored, "Strike him out!"\r\nBut Casey gave no outward sign that he had heard the shout.\r\n\r\nThe pitcher smiled and cut one loose; across the plate it spread;\r\nAnother hiss, another groan--"Strike one!" the umpire said.\r\nZip! Like a shot, the second curve broke just below his knee--\r\n"Strike two!" the umpire roared aloud; but Casey made no plea.\r\n\r\nNo roasting for the umpire now--his was an easy lot.\r\nBut here the pitcher twirled again--was that a rifle shot?\r\nA whack; a crack; and out through space the leather pellet flew--\r\nA blot against the distant sky, a speck against the blue.\r\n\r\nAbove the fence in center field, in rapid whirling flight\r\nThe sphere sailed on; the blot grew dim and then was lost to sight.\r\nTen thousand hats were thrown in air, ten thousand threw a fit;\r\nBut no one ever found the ball that mighty Casey hit!\r\n\r\nOh, somewhere in this favored land dark clouds may hide the sun,\r\nAnd somewhere bands no longer play and children have no fun;\r\nAnd somewhere over blighted lives there hangs a heavy pall,\r\nBut Mudville hearts are happy now--for Casey hit the ball!\r\n\r\n    _James Wilson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRock Me to Sleep\r\n\r\n\r\nBackward, turn backward, O time, in your flight,\r\nMake me a child again just for tonight!\r\nMother, come back from the echoless shore,\r\nTake me again to your heart as of yore;\r\nKiss from my forehead the furrows of care,\r\nSmooth the few silver threads out of my hair;\r\nOver my slumbers your loving watch keep;--\r\nRock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.\r\n\r\nBackward, flow backward, O tide of the years!\r\nI am so weary of toil and of tears,--\r\nToil without recompense, tears all in vain,--\r\nTake them, and give me my childhood again!\r\nI have grown weary of dust and decay,--\r\nWeary of flinging my soul-wealth away;\r\nWeary of sowing for others to reap;--\r\nRock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.\r\n\r\nTired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,\r\nMother, O mother, my heart calls for you!\r\nMany a summer the grass has grown green,\r\nBlossomed and faded, our faces between;\r\nYet with strong yearning and passionate pain\r\nLong I to-night for your presence again.\r\nCome from the silence so long and so deep;--\r\nRock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.\r\n\r\nOver my heart, in the days that are flown,\r\nNo love like mother-love ever has shone;\r\nNo other worship abides and endures--\r\nFaithful, unselfish and patient, like yours;\r\nNone like a mother can charm away pain\r\nFrom the sick soul and the world-weary brain.\r\nSlumber\'s soft calms o\'er my heavy lids creep;--\r\nRock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.\r\n\r\nCome, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,\r\nFall on your shoulders again as of old;\r\nLet it drop over my forehead to-night,\r\nShading my faint eyes away from the light;\r\nFor with its sunny-edged shadows once more\r\nHaply will throng the sweet visions of yore;\r\nLovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep;--\r\nRock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.\r\n\r\nMother, dear mother, the years have been long\r\nSince I last listened your lullaby song;\r\nSing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem\r\nWomanhood\'s years have been only a dream.\r\nClasped to your breast in a loving embrace,\r\nWith your light lashes just sweeping my face,\r\nNever hereafter to wake or to weep;--\r\nRock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.\r\n\r\n    _Elizabeth Akers Allen._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Answer to "Rock Me to Sleep"\r\n\r\n\r\nMy child, ah, my child; thou art weary to-night,\r\nThy spirit is sad, and dim is the light;\r\nThou wouldst call me back from the echoless shore\r\nTo the trials of life, to thy heart as of yore;\r\nThou longest again for my fond loving care,\r\nFor my kiss on thy cheek, for my hand on thy hair;\r\nBut angels around thee their loving watch keep,\r\nAnd angels, my darling, will rock thee to sleep.\r\n\r\n"Backward?"

Back we swept,\r\n  And when the bugle said,\r\n"Up, charge again!" no man was there\r\n  But hung his dogged head.\r\n"We\'ve no one left to lead us now,"\r\n  The sullen soldiers said.\r\n\r\nJust then before the laggard line\r\n  The colonel\'s horse we spied--\r\nBay Billy, with his trappings on,\r\n  His nostrils swelling wide,\r\nAs though still on his gallant back\r\n  The master sat astride.\r\n\r\nRight royally he took the place\r\n  That was of old his wont,\r\nAnd with a neigh that seemed to say,\r\n  Above the battle\'s brunt,\r\n"How can the Twenty-second charge\r\n  If I am not in front?"\r\n\r\nLike statues rooted there we stood,\r\n  And gazed a little space;\r\nAbove that floating mane we missed\r\n  The dear familiar face,\r\nBut we saw Bay Billy\'s eye of fire,\r\n  And it gave us heart of grace.\r\n\r\nNo bugle-call could rouse us all\r\n  As that brave sight had done.\r\nDown all the battered line we felt\r\n  A lightning impulse run.\r\nUp, up the hill we followed Bill,--\r\n  And we captured every gun!\r\n\r\nAnd when upon the conquered height\r\n  Died out the battle\'s hum,\r\nVainly \'mid living and the dead\r\n  We sought our leader dumb.\r\nIt seemed as if a spectre steed\r\n  To win that day had come.\r\n\r\nAnd then the dusk and dew of night\r\n  Fell softly o\'er the plain,\r\nAs though o\'er man\'s dread work of death\r\n  The angels wept again,\r\nAnd drew night\'s curtain gently round\r\n  A thousand beds of pain.\r\n\r\nAll night the surgeons\' torches went\r\n  The ghastly rows between,--\r\nAll night with solemn step I paced\r\n  The torn and bloody green.\r\nBut who that fought in the big war\r\n  Such dread sights have not seen?\r\n\r\nAt last the morning broke. The lark\r\n  Sang in the merry skies,\r\nAs if to e\'en the sleepers there\r\n  It said "Awake, arise!"\r\nThough naught but that last trump of all\r\n  Could ope their heavy eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd then once more, with banners gay,\r\n  Stretched out the long brigade.\r\nTrimly upon the furrowed field\r\n  The troops stood on parade,\r\nAnd bravely \'mid the ranks were closed\r\n  The gaps the fight had made.\r\n\r\nNot half the Twenty-second\'s men\r\n  Were in their place that morn;\r\nAnd Corporal Dick, who yester-noon\r\n  Stood six brave fellows on,\r\nNow touched my elbow in the ranks,\r\n  For all between were gone.\r\n\r\nAh! who forgets that weary hour\r\n  When, as with misty eyes,\r\nTo call the old familiar roll\r\n  The solemn sergeant tries,--\r\nOne feels that thumping of the heart\r\n  As no prompt voice replies.\r\n\r\nAnd as in faltering tone and slow\r\n  The last few names were said,\r\nAcross the field some missing horse\r\n  Toiled up with weary tread.\r\nIt caught the sergeant\'s eye, and quick\r\n  Bay Billy\'s name he read.\r\n\r\nYes! there the old bay hero stood,\r\n  All safe from battle\'s harms,\r\nAnd ere an order could be heard,\r\n  Or the bugle\'s quick alarms,\r\nDown all the front, from end to end,\r\n  The troops presented arms!\r\n\r\nNot all the shoulder-straps on earth\r\n  Could still our mighty cheer;\r\nAnd ever from that famous day,\r\n  When rang the roll-call clear,\r\nBay Billy\'s name was read, and then\r\n  The whole line answered, "Here!"\r\n\r\n    _Frank H. Gassaway._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Legend of the Organ-Builder\r\n\r\n\r\nDay by day the Organ-builder in his lonely chamber wrought;\r\nDay by day the soft air trembled to the music of his thought;\r\nTill at last the work was ended; and no organ voice so grand\r\nEver yet had soared responsive to the master\'s magic hand.\r\n\r\nAy, so rarely was it builded that whenever groom and bride,\r\nWho, in God\'s sight were well-pleasing, in the church stood side by side,\r\nWithout touch or breath the organ of itself began to play,\r\nAnd the very airs of heaven through the soft gloom seemed to stray.\r\n\r\nHe was young, the Organ-builder, and o\'er all the land his fame\r\nRan with fleet and eager footsteps, like a swiftly rushing flame.\r\nAll the maidens heard the story; all the maidens blushed and smiled,\r\nBy his youth and wondrous beauty and his great renown beguiled.\r\n\r\nSo he sought and won the fairest, and the wedding-day was set\r\nHappy day--the brightest jewel in the glad year\'s coronet!\r\nBut when they the portal entered, he forgot his lovely bride--\r\nForgot his love, forgot his God, and his heart swelled high with pride.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" thought he, "how great a master am I! When the organ plays,\r\nHow the vast cathedral-arches will re-echo with my praise!"\r\nUp the aisle the gay procession moved. The altar shone afar,\r\nWith every candle gleaming through soft shadows like a star.\r\n\r\nBut he listened, listened, listened, with no thought of love or prayer,\r\nFor the swelling notes of triumph from his organ standing there.\r\nAll was silent. Nothing heard he save the priest\'s low monotone,\r\nAnd the bride\'s robe trailing softly o\'er the floor of fretted stone.\r\n\r\nThen his lips grew white with anger. Surely God was pleased with him,\r\nWho had built the wondrous organ for His temple vast and dim!\r\nWhose the fault then? Hers--the maiden standing meekly at his side!\r\nFlamed his jealous rage, maintaining she was false to him--his bride.\r\n\r\nVain were all her protestations, vain her innocence and truth;\r\nOn that very night he left her to her anguish and her ruth.\r\nFar he wandered to a country wherein no man knew his name:\r\nFor ten weary years he dwelt there, nursing still his wrath and shame.\r\n\r\nThen his haughty heart grew softer, and he thought by night and day\r\nOf the bride he had deserted, till he hardly dared to pray;\r\nThought of her, a spotless maiden, fair and beautiful and good;\r\nThought of his relentless anger, that had cursed her womanhood;\r\n\r\nTill his yearning grief and penitence at last were all complete,\r\nAnd he longed, with bitter longing, just to fall down at her feet.\r\nAh! how throbbed his heart when, after many a weary day and night,\r\nRose his native towers before him, with the sunset glow alight!\r\n\r\nThrough the gates into the city on he pressed with eager tread;\r\nThere he met a long procession--mourners following the dead.\r\n"Now why weep ye so, good people? And whom bury ye today?\r\nWhy do yonder sorrowing maidens scatter flowers along the way?\r\n\r\n"Has some saint gone up to heaven?" "Yes," they answered, weeping sore;\r\n"For the Organ-builder\'s saintly wife our eyes shall see no more;\r\nAnd because her days were given to the service of God\'s poor,\r\nFrom His church we mean to bury her. See! yonder is the door."\r\n\r\nNo one knew him; no one wondered when he cried out, white with pain;\r\nNo one questioned when, with pallid lips, he poured his tears like rain.\r\n"\'Tis someone she has comforted, who mourns with us," they said,\r\nAs he made his way unchallenged, and bore the coffin\'s head;\r\n\r\nBore it through the open portal, bore it up the echoing aisle,\r\nLet it down before the altar, where the lights burned clear the while.\r\nWhen, oh, hark; the wondrous organ of itself began to play\r\nStrains of rare, unearthly sweetness never heard until that day!\r\n\r\nAll the vaulted arches rang with music sweet and clear;\r\nAll the air was filled with glory, as of angels hovering near;\r\nAnd ere yet the strain was ended, he who bore the coffin\'s head,\r\nWith the smile of one forgiven, gently sank beside it--dead.\r\n\r\nThey who raised the body knew him, and they laid him by his bride;\r\nDown the aisle and o\'er the threshold they were carried, side by side;\r\nWhile the organ played a dirge that no man ever heard before,\r\nAnd then softly sank to silence--silence kept forevermore.\r\n\r\n    _Julia C.

Halt; and tell\r\n  A fellow just a thing or two;\r\nYou\'ve had a furlough, been to see\r\n  How all the folks in Jersey do.\r\nIt\'s months ago since I was there--\r\n  I, and a bullet from Fair Oaks.\r\nWhen you were home, old comrade, say,\r\n  Did you see any of our folks?\r\n\r\n"You did?

No? A funeral? Who?\r\n  Who, Harry? how you shake and stare!\r\nAll well, you say, and all were out.\r\n  What ails you, Hal? Is this a hoax?\r\nWhy don\'t you tell me like a man:\r\n  What is the matter with our folks?"\r\n\r\n"I said all well, old comrade, true;\r\n  I say all well, for He knows best\r\nWho takes the young ones in his arms,\r\n  Before the sun goes to the west.\r\nThe axe-man Death deals right and left,\r\n  And flowers fall as well as oaks;\r\nAnd so--\r\n         Fair Annie blooms no more!\r\n  And that\'s the matter with your folks.\r\n\r\n"See, this long curl was kept for you;\r\n  And this white blossom from her breast;\r\nAnd here--your sister Bessie wrote\r\n  A letter telling all the rest.\r\nBear up, old friend."\r\n                      Nobody speaks;\r\n  Only the old camp-raven croaks,\r\nAnd soldiers whisper, "Boys, be still;\r\n  There\'s some bad news from Granger\'s folks."\r\n\r\nHe turns his back--the only foe\r\n  That ever saw it--on this grief,\r\nAnd, as men will, keeps down the tears\r\n  Kind nature sends to woe\'s relief.\r\nThen answers he: "Ah, Hal, I\'ll try;\r\n  But in my throat there\'s something chokes,\r\nBecause, you see, I\'ve thought so long\r\n  To count her in among our folks.\r\n\r\n"I s\'pose she must be happy now,\r\n  But still I will keep thinking, too,\r\nI could have kept all trouble off,\r\n  By being tender, kind and true.\r\nBut maybe not.\r\n               She\'s safe up there,\r\n  And when the Hand deals other strokes,\r\nShe\'ll stand by Heaven\'s gate, I know,\r\n  And wait to welcome in our folks."\r\n\r\n    _Ethel Lynn Beers._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Face upon the Floor\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Twas a balmy summer evening, and a goodly crowd was there,\r\nWhich well-nigh filled Joe\'s bar-room on the corner of the square;\r\nAnd as songs and witty stories came through the open door,\r\nA vagabond crept slowly in and posed upon the floor.\r\n\r\n"Where did it come from?" someone said. "The wind has blown it in."\r\n"What does it want?" another cried. "Some whisky, rum or gin?"\r\n"Here, Toby, seek him, if your stomach\'s equal to the work--\r\nI wouldn\'t touch him with a fork, he\'s as filthy as a Turk."\r\n\r\nThis badinage the poor wretch took with stoical, good grace;\r\nIn fact, he smiled as though he thought he\'d struck the proper place.\r\n"Come, boys, I know there\'s kindly hearts among so good a crowd--\r\nTo be in such good company would make a deacon proud.\r\n\r\n"Give me a drink--that\'s what I want--I\'m out of funds, you know;\r\nWhen I had cash to treat the gang, this hand was never slow.\r\nWhat? You laugh as though you thought this pocket never held a sou;\r\nI once was fixed as well, my boys, as any one of you.\r\n\r\n"There, thanks; that\'s braced me nicely; God bless you one and all;\r\nNext time I pass this good saloon, I\'ll make another call.\r\n_Give you a song?_ No, I can\'t do that, my singing days are past;\r\nMy voice is cracked, my throat\'s worn out, and my lungs are going fast.\r\n\r\n"Say! give me another whisky, and I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do--\r\nI\'ll tell you a funny story, and a fact, I promise, too.\r\nThat I was ever a decent man, not one of you would think;\r\nBut I was, some four or five years back. Say, give me another drink.\r\n\r\n"Fill her up, Joe, I want to put some life into my frame--\r\nSuch little drinks, to a bum like me, are miserably tame;\r\nFive fingers--there, that\'s the scheme--and corking whisky, too.\r\nWell, here\'s luck, boys; and landlord, my best regards to you.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve treated me pretty kindly, and I\'d like to tell you how\r\nI came to be the dirty sot you see before you now.\r\nAs I told you, once I was a man, with muscle, frame and health,\r\nAnd but for a blunder, ought to have made considerable wealth.\r\n\r\n"I was a painter--not one that daubed on bricks and wood,\r\nBut an artist, and, for my age, was rated pretty good.\r\nI worked hard at my canvas, and was bidding fair to rise,\r\nFor gradually I saw the star of fame before my eyes.\r\n\r\n"I made a picture, perhaps you\'ve seen, \'tis called the \'Chase of Fame.\'\r\nIt brought me fifteen hundred pounds, and added to my name.\r\nAnd then I met a woman--now comes the funny part--\r\nWith eyes that petrified my brain and sunk into my heart.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you laugh? \'Tis funny that the vagabond you see\r\nCould ever love a woman, and expect her love for me;\r\nBut \'twas so, and for a month or two her smiles were freely given,\r\nAnd when her loving lips touched mine it carried me to heaven.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see a woman for whom your soul you\'d give,\r\nWith a form like the Milo Venus, too beautiful to live;\r\nWith eyes that would beat the Koh-i-noor, and a wealth of chestnut hair?\r\nIf so, \'twas she, for there never was another half so fair.\r\n\r\n"I was working on a portrait, one afternoon in May,\r\nOf a fair-haired boy, a friend of mine, who lived across the way;\r\nAnd Madeline admired it, and, much to my surprise,\r\nSaid that she\'d like to know the man that had such dreamy eyes.\r\n\r\n"It didn\'t take long to know him, and before the month had flown,\r\nMy friend had stolen my darling, and I was left alone;\r\nAnd ere a year of misery had passed above my head,\r\nThe jewel I had treasured so had tarnished, and was dead.\r\n\r\n"That\'s why I took to drink, boys. Why, I never saw you smile,--\r\nI thought you\'d be amused, and laughing all the while.\r\nWhy, what\'s the mattter, friend? There\'s a teardrop in your eye,\r\nCome, laugh, like me; \'tis only babes and women that should cry.\r\n\r\n"Say, boys, if you give me just another whisky, I\'ll be glad,\r\nAnd I\'ll draw right here a picture of the face that drove me mad.\r\nGive me that piece of chalk with which you mark the baseball score--\r\nYou shall see the lovely Madeline upon the bar-room floor."\r\n\r\nAnother drink, and, with chalk in hand, the vagabond began\r\nTo sketch a face that well might buy the soul of any man.\r\nThen as he placed another lock upon the shapely head,\r\nWith a fearful shriek, he leaped, and fell across the picture dead.\r\n\r\n    _H. Antoine D\'Arcy._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Calf Path\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day through the primeval wood,\r\nA calf walked home, as good calves should;\r\nBut made a trail all bent askew,\r\nA crooked trail, as all calves do.\r\nSince then three hundred years have fled,\r\nAnd, I infer, the calf is dead.\r\n\r\nBut still he left behind his trail,\r\nAnd thereby hangs a moral tale.\r\nThe trail was taken up next day\r\nBy a lone dog that passed that way,\r\nAnd then the wise bell-wether sheep\r\nPursued the trail o\'er vale and steep,\r\nAnd drew the flock behind him, too,\r\nAs good bell-wethers always do.\r\nAnd from that day, o\'er hill and glade,\r\nThrough those old woods a path was made.\r\n\r\nAnd many men wound in and out,\r\nAnd turned and dodged and bent about,\r\nAnd uttered words of righteous wrath\r\nBecause \'twas such a crooked path:\r\nBut still they followed--do not laugh--\r\nThe first migrations of that calf,\r\nAnd through this winding woodway stalked\r\nBecause he wabbled when he walked.\r\n\r\nThis forest path became a lane,\r\nThat bent and turned and turned again;\r\nThis crooked path became a road.\r\nWhere many a poor horse, with his load,\r\nToiled on beneath the burning sun,\r\nAnd traveled some three miles in one.\r\nAnd thus a century and a half\r\nThey trod the footsteps of that calf.\r\n\r\nThe years passed on in swiftness fleet,\r\nThe road became a village street;\r\nAnd this, before men were aware,\r\nA city\'s crowded thoroughfare.\r\nAnd soon the central street was this\r\nOf a renowned metropolis.\r\nAnd men two centuries and a half\r\nTrod in the footsteps of that calf!\r\n\r\nEach day a hundred thousand rout\r\nFollowed the zigzag calf about;\r\nAnd o\'er his crooked journey went\r\nThe traffic of a continent.\r\nA hundred thousand men were led\r\nBy a calf near three centuries dead.\r\nThey followed still his crooked way\r\nAnd lost one hundred years a day;\r\nFor thus such reverence is lent\r\nTo well-established precedent.\r\n\r\nA moral lesson this might teach\r\nWere I ordained and called to preach;\r\nFor men are prone to go it blind,\r\nAlong the calf-paths of the mind,\r\nAnd work away from sun to sun\r\nTo do what other men have done.\r\nThey follow in the beaten track,\r\nAnd out and in, and forth and back,\r\nAnd still their devious course pursue,\r\nTo keep the path that others do.\r\nBut how the wise wood-gods must laugh,\r\nWho saw the first primeval calf;\r\nAh, many things this tale might teach--\r\nBut I am not ordained to preach.\r\n\r\n    _Sam Walter Foss._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ride of Jennie M\'Neal\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Revere was a rider bold--\r\nWell has his valorous deed been told;\r\nSheridan\'s ride was a glorious one--\r\nOften it has been dwelt upon;\r\nBut why should men do all the deeds\r\nOn which the love of a patriot feeds?\r\nHearken to me, while I reveal\r\nThe dashing ride of Jennie M\'Neal.\r\n\r\nOn a spot as pretty as might be found\r\nIn the dangerous length of the Neutral Ground,\r\nIn a cottage, cozy, and all their own,\r\nShe and her mother lived alone.\r\nSafe were the two, with their frugal store,\r\nFrom all of the many who passed their door;\r\nFor Jennie\'s mother was strange to fears,\r\nAnd Jennie was large for fifteen years;\r\nWith vim her eyes were glistening,\r\nHer hair was the hue of a blackbird\'s wing;\r\nAnd while the friends who knew her well\r\nThe sweetness of her heart could tell,\r\nA gun that hung on the kitchen wall\r\nLooked solemnly quick to heed her call;\r\nAnd they who were evil-minded knew\r\nHer nerve was strong and her aim was true.\r\nSo all kind words and acts did deal\r\nTo generous, black-eyed Jennie M\'Neal.\r\n\r\nOne night, when the sun had crept to bed,\r\nAnd rain-clouds lingered overhead,\r\nAnd sent their surly drops for proof\r\nTo drum a tune on the cottage roof,\r\nClose after a knock at the outer door\r\nThere entered a dozen dragoons or more.\r\nTheir red coats, stained by the muddy road,\r\nThat they were British soldiers showed;\r\nThe captain his hostess bent to greet,\r\nSaying, "Madam, please give us a bit to eat;\r\nWe will pay you well, and, if may be,\r\nThis bright-eyed girl for pouring our tea;\r\nThen we must dash ten miles ahead,\r\nTo catch a rebel colonel abed.\r\nHe is visiting home, as doth appear;\r\nWe will make his pleasure cost him dear."\r\nAnd they fell on the hasty supper with zeal,\r\nClose-watched the while by Jennie M\'Neal.\r\n\r\nFor the gray-haired colonel they hovered near\r\nHad been her true friend, kind and dear;\r\nAnd oft, in her younger days, had he\r\nRight proudly perched her upon his knee,\r\nAnd told her stories many a one\r\nConcerning the French war lately done.\r\nAnd oft together the two friends were,\r\nAnd many the arts he had taught to her;\r\nShe had hunted by his fatherly side,\r\nHe had shown her how to fence and ride;\r\nAnd once had said, "The time may be,\r\nYour skill and courage may stand by me."\r\nSo sorrow for him she could but feel,\r\nBrave, grateful-hearted Jennie M\'Neal.\r\n\r\nWith never a thought or a moment more,\r\nBare-headed she slipped from the cottage door,\r\nRan out where the horses were left to feed,\r\nUnhitched and mounted the captain\'s steed,\r\nAnd down the hilly and rock-strewn way\r\nShe urged the fiery horse of gray.\r\nAround her slender and cloakless form\r\nPattered and moaned the ceaseless storm;\r\nSecure and tight a gloveless hand\r\nGrasped the reins with stern command;\r\nAnd full and black her long hair streamed,\r\nWhenever the ragged lightning gleamed.\r\nAnd on she rushed for the colonel\'s weal,\r\nBrave, lioness-hearted Jennie M\'Neal.\r\n\r\nHark! from the hills, a moment mute,\r\nCame a clatter of hoofs in hot pursuit;\r\nAnd a cry from the foremost trooper said,\r\n"Halt! or your blood be on your head";\r\nShe heeded it not, and not in vain\r\nShe lashed the horse with the bridle-rein.\r\n\r\nSo into the night the gray horse strode;\r\nHis shoes hewed fire from the rocky road;\r\nAnd the high-born courage that never dies\r\nFlashed from his rider\'s coal-black eyes.\r\nThe pebbles flew from the fearful race:\r\nThe raindrops grasped at her glowing face.\r\n"On, on, brave beast!" with loud appeal,\r\nCried eager, resolute Jennie M\'Neal.\r\n\r\n"Halt!" once more came the voice of dread;\r\n"Halt! or your blood be on your head!"\r\nThen, no one answering to the calls,\r\nSped after her a volley of balls.\r\nThey passed her in her rapid flight,\r\nThey screamed to her left, they screamed to her right;\r\nBut, rushing still o\'er the slippery track,\r\nShe sent no token of answer back,\r\nExcept a silvery laughter-peal,\r\nBrave, merry-hearted Jennie M\'Neal.\r\n\r\nSo on she rushed, at her own good will,\r\nThrough wood and valley, o\'er plain and hill;\r\nThe gray horse did his duty well,\r\nTill all at once he stumbled and fell,\r\nHimself escaping the nets of harm,\r\nBut flinging the girl with a broken arm.\r\nStill undismayed by the numbing pain,\r\nShe clung to the horse\'s bridle-rein\r\nAnd gently bidding him to stand,\r\nPetted him with her able hand;\r\nThen sprung again to the saddle bow,\r\nAnd shouted, "One more trial now!"\r\nAs if ashamed of the heedless fall,\r\nHe gathered his strength once more for all,\r\nAnd, galloping down a hillside steep,\r\nGained on the troopers at every leap;\r\nNo more the high-bred steed did reel,\r\nBut ran his best for Jennie M\'Neal.\r\n\r\nThey were a furlong behind, or more,\r\nWhen the girl burst through the colonel\'s door,\r\nHer poor arm helpless hanging with pain,\r\nAnd she all drabbled and drenched with rain,\r\nBut her cheeks as red as fire-brands are,\r\nAnd her eyes as bright as a blazing star,\r\nAnd shouted, "Quick! be quick, I say!\r\nThey come! they come! Away! away!"\r\nThen, sunk on the rude white floor of deal,\r\nPoor, brave, exhausted Jennie M\'Neal.\r\n\r\nThe startled colonel sprung, and pressed\r\nThe wife and children to his breast,\r\nAnd turned away from his fireside bright,\r\nAnd glided into the stormy night;\r\nThen soon and safely made his way\r\nTo where the patriot army lay.\r\nBut first he bent in the dim firelight,\r\nAnd kissed the forehead broad and white,\r\nAnd blessed the girl who had ridden so well\r\nTo keep him out of a prison-cell.\r\nThe girl roused up at the martial din,\r\nJust as the troopers came rushing in,\r\nAnd laughed, e\'en in the midst of a moan,\r\nSaying, "Good sirs, your bird has flown.\r\n\'Tis I who have scared him from his nest;\r\nSo deal with me now as you think best."\r\nBut the grand young captain bowed, and said,\r\n"Never you hold a moment\'s dread.\r\nOf womankind I must crown you queen;\r\nSo brave a girl I have never seen.\r\nWear this gold ring as your valor\'s due;\r\nAnd when peace comes I will come for you."\r\nBut Jennie\'s face an arch smile wore,\r\nAs she said, "There\'s a lad in Putnam\'s corps,\r\nWho told me the same, long time ago;\r\nYou two would never agree, I know.\r\nI promised my love to be as true as steel,"\r\nSaid good, sure-hearted Jennie M\'Neal.\r\n\r\n    _Will Carleton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hand That Rules the World\r\n\r\n\r\nThey say that man is mighty, he governs land and sea;\r\nHe wields a mighty scepter o\'er lesser powers that be;\r\nBy a mightier power and stronger, man from his throne is hurled,\r\nAnd the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world.\r\n\r\nBlessings on the hand of woman!

Step in; \'tis a cheerless place,\r\nBut you\'re heartily welcome all the same; to be poor is no disgrace.\r\nHave I been here long? Oh, yes, sir! \'tis thirty winters gone\r\nSince poor Jim took to crooked ways and left me all alone!\r\nJim was my son, and a likelier lad you\'d never wish to see,\r\nTill evil counsels won his heart and led him away from me.\r\n\r\n\'Tis the old, sad, pitiful story, sir, of the devil\'s winding stair,\r\nAnd men go down--and down--and down--to blackness and despair;\r\nTossing about like wrecks at sea, with helm and anchor lost,\r\nOn and on, through the surging waves, nor caring to count the cost;\r\nI doubt sometimes if the Savior sees, He seems so far away,\r\nHow the souls He loved and died for, are drifting--drifting astray!\r\n\r\nIndeed,\'tis little wonder, sir, if woman shrinks and cries\r\nWhen the life-blood on Rum\'s altar spilled is calling to the skies;\r\nSmall wonder if her own heart feels each sacrificial blow,\r\nFor isn\'t each life a part of hers? each pain her hurt and woe?\r\nRead all the records of crime and shame--\'tis bitterly, sadly true;\r\nWhere manliness and honor die, there some woman\'s heart dies, too.\r\n\r\nI often think, when I hear folks talk so prettily and so fine\r\nOf "alcohol as needful food"; of the "moderate use of wine";\r\nHow "the world couldn\'t do without it, there was clearly no other way\r\nBut for a man to drink, or let it alone, as his own strong will might say";\r\nThat "to use it, but not abuse it, was the proper thing to do,"\r\nHow I wish they\'d let old Poorhouse Nan preach her little sermon, too!\r\n\r\nI would give them scenes in a woman\'s life that would make their\r\n          pulses stir,\r\nFor I was a drunkard\'s child and wife--aye, a drunkard\'s mother, sir!\r\nI would tell of childish terrors, of childish tears and pain.\r\nOf cruel blows from a father\'s hand when rum had crazed his brain;\r\nHe always said he could drink his fill, or let it alone as well;\r\nPerhaps he might, he was killed one night in a brawl--in a grog-shop hell!\r\n\r\nI would tell of years of loveless toil the drunkard\'s child had passed,\r\nWith just one gleam of sunshine, too beautiful to last.\r\nWhen I married Tom I thought for sure I had nothing more to fear,\r\nThat life would come all right at last; the world seemed full of cheer.\r\nBut he took to moderate drinking--he allowed \'twas a harmless thing,\r\nSo the arrow sped, and my bird of Hope came down with a broken wing.\r\n\r\nTom was only a moderate drinker; ah, sir, do you bear in mind\r\nHow the plodding tortoise in the race left the leaping hare behind?\r\n\'Twas because he held right on and on, steady and true, if slow,\r\nAnd that\'s the way, I\'m thinking, that the moderate drinkers go!\r\nStep over step--day after day--with sleepless, tireless pace,\r\nWhile the toper sometimes looks behind and tarries in the race!\r\n\r\nAh, heavily in the well-worn path poor Tom walked day by day,\r\nFor my heart-strings clung about his feet and tangled up the way;\r\nThe days were dark, and friends were gone, and life dragged on full slow,\r\nAnd children came, like reapers, and to a harvest of want and woe!\r\nTwo of them died, and I was glad when they lay before me dead;\r\nI had grown so weary of their cries--their pitiful cries for bread.\r\n\r\nThere came a time when my heart was stone; I could neither hope nor pray;\r\nPoor Tom lay out in the Potter\'s Field, and my boy had gone astray;\r\nMy boy who\'d been my idol, while, like hound athirst for blood,\r\nBetween my breaking heart and him the liquor seller stood,\r\nAnd lured him on with pleasant words, his pleasures and his wine;\r\nAh, God have pity on other hearts as bruised and hurt as mine.\r\n\r\nThere were whispers of evil-doing, of dishonor, and of shame,\r\nThat I cannot bear to think of now, and would not dare to name!\r\nThere was hiding away from the light of day, there was creeping about at\r\n     night,\r\nA hurried word of parting--then a criminal\'s stealthy flight!\r\nHis lips were white with remorse and fright when he gave me a good-by kiss;\r\nAnd I\'ve never seen my poor lost boy from that black day to this.\r\n\r\nAh, none but a mother can tell you, sir, how a mother\'s heart will ache,\r\nWith the sorrow that comes of a sinning child, with grief for a lost one\'s\r\n     sake,\r\nWhen she knows the feet she trained to walk have gone so far astray,\r\nAnd the lips grown bold with curses that she taught to sing and pray;\r\nA child may fear--a wife may weep, but of all sad things, none other\r\nSeems half so sorrowful to me as being a drunkard\'s mother.\r\n\r\nThey tell me that down in the vilest dens of the city\'s crime and murk,\r\nThere are men with the hearts of angels, doing the angels\' work;\r\nThat they win back the lost and the straying, that they help the weak to\r\n     stand,\r\nBy the wonderful power of loving words--and the help of God\'s right hand!\r\nAnd often and often, the dear Lord knows, I\'ve knelt and prayed to Him,\r\nThat somewhere, somehow, \'twould happen that they\'d find and save my Jim!\r\n\r\nYou\'ll say \'tis a poor old woman\'s whim; but when I prayed last night,\r\nRight over yon eastern window there shone a wonderful light!\r\n(Leastways it looked that way to me) and out of the light there fell\r\nThe softest voice I had ever heard: it rung like a silver bell;\r\nAnd these were the words, "The prodigal turns, so tired by want and sin,\r\nHe seeks his father\'s open door--he weeps--and enters in."\r\n\r\nWhy, sir, you\'re crying as hard as I; what--is it really done?\r\nHave the loving voice and the Helping Hand brought back my wandering son?\r\nDid you kiss me and call me "Mother"--and hold me to your breast,\r\nOr is it one of the taunting dreams that come to mock my rest?\r\nNo--no! thank God, \'tis a dream come true! I can die, for He\'s saved\r\n          my boy!\r\nAnd the poor old heart that had lived on grief was broken at last by joy!\r\n\r\n    _Lucy M.

and we things that are now,\r\nWho walk on the turf that lies over their brow,\r\nWho make in their dwellings a transient abode\r\nMeet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road.\r\n\r\nYea, hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain,\r\nAre mingled together in sunshine and rain;\r\nAnd the smile, and the tear, and the song and the dirge\r\nStill follow each other like surge upon surge.\r\n\r\n\'Tis the wink of an eye, \'tis the draught of a breath\r\nFrom the blossoms of health to the paleness of death;\r\nFrom the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud--\r\nOh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud!\r\n\r\n    _William Knox._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow He Saved St. Michael\'s\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Twas long ago--ere ever the signal gun\r\nThat blazed before Fort Sumter had wakened the North as one;\r\nLong ere the wondrous pillar of battle-cloud and fire\r\nHad marked where the unchained millions marched on to their heart\'s desire.\r\nOn roofs and glittering turrets, that night, as the sun went down,\r\nThe mellow glow of the twilight shone like a jeweled crown,\r\nAnd, bathed in the living glory, as the people lifted their eyes,\r\nThey saw the pride of the city, the spire of St. Michael\'s rise\r\nHigh over the lesser steeples, tipped with a golden ball\r\nThat hung like a radiant planet caught in its earthward fall;\r\nFirst glimpse of home to the sailor who made the harbor round,\r\nAnd last slow-fading vision dear to the outward bound.\r\nThe gently gathering shadows shut out the waning light;\r\nThe children prayed at their bedsides as they were wont each night;\r\nThe noise of buyer and seller from the busy mart was gone,\r\nAnd in dreams of a peaceful morrow the city slumbered on.\r\n\r\nBut another light than sunrise aroused the sleeping street,\r\nFor a cry was heard at midnight, and the rush of trampling feet;\r\nMen stared in each other\'s faces, thro\' mingled fire and smoke,\r\nWhile the frantic bells went clashing clamorous, stroke on stroke.\r\nBy the glare of her blazing roof-tree the houseless mother fled,\r\nWith the babe she pressed to her bosom shrieking in nameless dread;\r\nWhile the fire-king\'s wild battalions scaled wall and cap-stone high,\r\nAnd painted their glaring banners against an inky sky.\r\nFrom the death that raged behind them, and the crush of ruin loud,\r\nTo the great square of the city, were driven the surging crowd,\r\nWhere yet firm in all the tumult, unscathed by the fiery flood,\r\nWith its heavenward pointing finger the church of St. Michael\'s stood.\r\n\r\nBut e\'en as they gazed upon it there rose a sudden wail,\r\nA cry of horror blended with the roaring of the gale,\r\nOn whose scorching wings updriven, a single flaming brand,\r\nAloft on the towering steeple clung like a bloody hand,\r\n"Will it fade?" the whisper trembled from a thousand whitening lips;\r\nFar out on the lurid harbor they watched it from the ships.\r\nA baleful gleam, that brighter and ever brighter shone,\r\nLike a flickering, trembling will-o\'-the-wisp to a steady beacon grown.\r\n"Uncounted gold shall be given to the man whose brave right hand,\r\nFor the love of the periled city, plucks down yon burning brand!"\r\nSo cried the Mayor of Charleston, that all the people heard,\r\nBut they looked each one at his fellow, and no man spoke a word,\r\nWho is it leans from the belfry, with face upturned to the sky--\r\nClings to a column and measures the dizzy spire with his eye?\r\nWill he dare it, the hero undaunted, that terrible, sickening height,\r\nOr will the hot blood of his courage freeze in his veins at the sight?\r\nBut see! he has stepped on the railing, he climbs with his feet and his\r\n     hands,\r\nAnd firm on a narrow projection, with the belfry beneath him, he stands!\r\nNow once, and once only, they cheer him--a single tempestuous breath,\r\nAnd there falls on the multitude gazing a hush like the stillness of death.\r\n\r\nSlow, steadily mounting, unheeding aught save the goal of the fire,\r\nStill higher and higher, an atom, he moves on the face of the spire:\r\nHe stops! Will he fall? Lo! for answer, a gleam like a meteor\'s track,\r\nAnd, hurled on the stones of the pavement, the red brand lies shattered and\r\n     black!\r\nOnce more the shouts of the people have rent the quivering air;\r\nAt the church door mayor and council wait with their feet on the stair,\r\nAnd the eager throng behind them press for a touch of his hand--\r\nThe unknown savior whose daring could compass a deed so grand.\r\n\r\nBut why does a sudden tremor seize on them as they gaze?\r\nAnd what meaneth that stifled murmur of wonder and amaze?\r\nHe stood in the gate of the temple he had periled his life to save,\r\nAnd the face of the unknown hero was the sable face of a slave!\r\nWith folded arms he was speaking in tones that were clear, not loud,\r\nAnd his eyes, ablaze in their sockets, burnt into the eyes of the crowd.\r\n"Ye may keep your gold, I scorn it! but answer me, ye who can,\r\nIf the deed I have done before you be not the deed of a _man?_"\r\n\r\nHe stepped but a short space backward, and from all the women and men\r\nThere were only sobs for answer, and the mayor called for a pen,\r\nAnd the great seal of the city, that he might read who ran,\r\nAnd the slave who saved St. Michael\'s went out from its door a man.\r\n\r\n    _Mary A.P. Stansbury._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBingen on the Rhine\r\n\r\n\r\nA soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,\r\nThere was lack of woman\'s nursing, there was dearth of woman\'s tears;\r\nBut a comrade stood beside him, while his life-blood ebbed away,\r\nAnd bent, with pitying glances, to hear what he might say.\r\nThe dying soldier faltered, as he took that comrade\'s hand,\r\nAnd he said, "I never more shall see my own, my native land;\r\nTake a message, and a token, to some distant friends of mine,\r\nFor I was born at Bingen--at Bingen on the Rhine!\r\n\r\n"Tell my brothers and companions, when they meet and crowd around\r\nTo hear my mournful story in the pleasant vineyard ground,\r\nThat we fought the battle bravely, and when the day was done,\r\nFull many a corpse lay ghastly pale, beneath the setting sun.\r\nAnd \'midst the dead and dying, were some grown old in wars,\r\nThe death-wound on their gallant breasts the last of many scars:\r\nBut some were young--and suddenly beheld life\'s morn decline;\r\nAnd one had come from Bingen--fair Bingen on the Rhine!\r\n\r\n"Tell my mother that her other sons shall comfort her old age,\r\nAnd I was aye a truant bird, that thought his home a cage:\r\nFor my father was a soldier, and even as a child\r\nMy heart leaped forth to hear him tell of struggles fierce and wild;\r\nAnd when he died, and left us to divide his scanty hoard,\r\nI let them take whate\'er they would, but kept my father\'s sword,\r\nAnd with boyish love I hung it where the bright light used to shine,\r\nOn the cottage-wall at Bingen--calm Bingen on the Rhine!\r\n\r\n"Tell my sister not to weep for me, and sob with drooping head,\r\nWhen the troops are marching home again with glad and gallant tread;\r\nBut to look upon them proudly, with a calm and steadfast eye,\r\nFor her brother was a soldier too, and not afraid to die.\r\nAnd if a comrade seek her love, I ask her in my name\r\nTo listen to him kindly, without regret or shame;\r\nAnd to hang the old sword in its place (my father\'s sword and mine),\r\nFor the honor of old Bingen--dear Bingen on the Rhine!\r\n\r\n"There\'s another--not a sister; in the happy days gone by,\r\nYou\'d have known her by the merriment that sparkled in her eye;\r\nToo innocent for coquetry--too fond for idle scorning--\r\nOh, friend! I fear the lightest heart makes sometimes heaviest mourning;\r\nTell her the last night of my life (for ere the moon be risen\r\nMy body will be out of pain--my soul be out of prison),\r\nI dreamed I stood with her, and saw the yellow sunlight shine\r\nOn the vine-clad hills of Bingen--fair Bingen on the Rhine!\r\n\r\n"I saw the blue Rhine sweep along--I heard, or seemed to hear.\r\nThe German songs we used to sing, in chorus sweet and clear;\r\nAnd down the pleasant river, and up the slanting hill,\r\nThe echoing chorus sounded, through the evening calm and still;\r\nAnd her glad blue eyes were on me as we passed with friendly talk\r\nDown many a path beloved of yore, and well-remembered walk,\r\nAnd her little hand lay lightly, confidingly in mine:\r\nBut we\'ll meet no more at Bingen--loved Bingen on the Rhine!"\r\n\r\nHis voice grew faint and hoarser,--his grasp was childish weak,--\r\nHis eyes put on a dying look,--he sighed and ceased to speak;\r\nHis comrade bent to lift him, but the spark of life had fled,--\r\nThe soldier of the Legion, in a foreign land--was dead!\r\nAnd the soft moon rose up slowly, and calmly she looked down\r\nOn the red sand of the battle-field, with bloody corpses strown;\r\nYea, calmly on that dreadful scene her pale light seemed to shine\r\nAs it shone on distant Bingen--fair Bingen on the Rhine!\r\n\r\n    _Caroline Norton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollege Oil Cans\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a board of bright mosaic wrought in many a quaint design,\r\nGleam a brace of silver goblets wreathed with flowers and filled with wine.\r\nRound the board a group is seated; here and there are threads of white\r\nWhich their dark locks lately welcomed; but they\'re only boys tonight.\r\nSome whose words have thrilled the senate, some who win the critic\'s\r\n     praise--\r\nAll are "chums" to-night, with voices redolent of college days.\r\n\r\n"Boys," said one, "do you remember that old joke--about the wine--\r\nHow we used to fill our oil cans and repair to \'No. 9\'?\r\nBut at last the old professor--never long was he outdone--\r\nOpened up our shining oil cans and demolished all our fun!"\r\nIn the laugh that rings so gayly through the richly curtained room,\r\nJoin they all, save one; Why is it? Does he see the waxen bloom\r\nTremble in its vase of silver? Does he see the ruddy wine\r\nShiver in its crystal goblet, or do those grave eyes divine\r\nSomething sadder yet? He pauses till their mirth has died away,\r\nThen in measured tones speaks gravely:\r\n"Boys, a story, if I may, I will tell you, though it may not merit\r\n     worthily your praise,\r\nIt is bitter fruitage ripened from our pranks of college days,"\r\n\r\nEagerly they claim the story, for they know the LL.D.\r\nWith his flexible voice would garnish any tale, whate\'er it be.\r\n\r\n"Just a year ago to-night, boys, I was in my room alone,\r\nAt the San Francisco L---- House, when I heard a plaintive moan\r\nSounding from the room adjoining. Hoping to give some relief\r\nTo the suffering one, I entered; but it thrilled my heart with grief\r\nJust to see that wreck of manhood--bloated face, disheveled hair--\r\nWildly tossing, ever moaning, while his thin hands beat the air.\r\nBroken prayers, vile oaths and curses filled the air as I drew near;\r\nThen in faint and piteous accents, these words I could plainly hear:\r\n\'Give me one more chance--one only--let me see my little Belle--\r\nThen I\'ll follow where they lead me, be it to the depths of hell!\'\r\nWhen he saw me he grew calmer, started strangely--looked me o\'er--\r\nOh, the glory of expression! I had seen those eyes before!\r\nYes, I knew him; it was Horace, he who won the college prize;\r\nNaught remained of his proud beauty but the splendor of his eyes.\r\nHe whom we were all so proud of, lay there in the fading light.\r\nIf my years should number fourscore, I shall ne\'er forget that sight.\r\nAnd he knew me--called me \'Albert,\' ere a single word I\'d said--\r\nWe were comrades in the old days; I sat down beside the bed.\r\n\r\n"Horace seemed to grow more quiet, but he would not go to sleep;\r\nHe kept talking of our boyhood while my hand he still would keep\r\nIn his own so white and wasted, and with burning eyes would gaze\r\nOn my face, still talking feebly of the dear old college days.\r\n\'Ah,\' he said, \'life held such promise; but, alas! I am to-day\r\nBut a poor degraded outcast--hopes, ambition swept away,\r\nAnd it dates back to those oil cans that we filled in greatest glee.\r\nLittle did I think in those days what the harvest now would be!\'\r\n\r\n"For a moment he was silent, then a cry whose anguish yet\r\nWrings my heart, burst from his white lips, though his teeth were tightly\r\n     set,\r\nAnd with sudden strength he started--sprang from my detaining arm,\r\nShrieking wildly, \'Curse the demons; do they think to do me harm?\r\nBack! I say, ye forked-tongued serpents reeking with the filth of hell!\r\nDon\'t ye see I have her with me--my poor sainted little Belle?\'\r\n\r\n"When I\'d soothed him into quiet, with a trembling arm he drew\r\nMy head down, \'Oh, Al,\' he whispered, \'such remorse you never knew.\'\r\nAnd again I tried to soothe him, but my eyes o\'erbrimmed with tears;\r\nHis were dry and clear, as brilliant as they were in college years.\r\nAll the flush had left his features, he lay white as marble now;\r\nTenderly I smoothed his pillow, wiped the moisture from his brow.\r\nThough I begged him to be quiet, he would talk of those old days,\r\nBrokenly at times, but always of \'the boys\' with loving praise.\r\n\r\n"Once I asked him of Lorena--the sweet girl whom he had wed--\r\nYou remember Rena Barstow. When I asked if she were dead,\r\n\'No,\' he said, his poor voice faltering, \'she is far beyond the Rhine,\r\nBut I wish, to God, it were so, and I still might call her mine.\r\nShe\'s divorced--she\'s mine no longer,\' here his voice grew weak and hoarse\r\n\'But although I am a drunkard, _I have one they can\'t divorce_.\r\nI\'ve a little girl in heaven, playing round the Savior\'s knee,\r\nAlways patient and so faithful that at last she died for me.\r\n\r\n"\'I had drank so much, so often, that my brain was going wild;\r\nEvery one had lost hope in me but my faithful little child.\r\nShe would say, "Now stop, dear papa, for I know you can stop _now_."\r\nI would promise, kiss my darling, and the next day break my vow.\r\nSo it went until one Christmas, dark and stormy, cold and drear;\r\nOut I started, just as usual, for the cursed rum shop near,\r\nAnd my darling followed after, in the storm of rain and sleet,\r\nWith no covering wrapped about her, naught but slippers on her feet;\r\nNo one knew it, no one missed her, till there came with solemn tread,\r\nStern-faced men unto our dwelling, bringing back our darling--_dead!_\r\nThey had found her cold and lifeless, like, they said, an angel fair,\r\nLeaning \'gainst the grog shop window--oh, she thought that _I was there!_\r\nThen he raised his arms toward heaven, called aloud unto the dead,\r\nFor his mind again was wandering: \'Belle, my precious Belle!\' he said,\r\n\'Papa\'s treasure--papa\'s darling! oh, my baby--did--you--come\r\nAll the way--alone--my darling--just to lead--poor--papa--home?\'\r\nAnd he surely had an answer, for a silence o\'er him fell.\r\nAnd I sat alone and lonely--death had come with little Belle."\r\n\r\nSilence in that princely parlor--head of every guest is bowed.\r\nThey still see the red wine sparkle, but \'tis through a misty cloud.\r\nSaid the host at last, arising, "I have scorned the pledge to sign,\r\nLaughed at temperance all my life long. Never more shall drop of wine\r\nTouch my lips. The fruit _was_ bitter, boys; \'twas I proposed it first--\r\nThat foul joke from which poor Horace ever bore a life accurst!\r\nLet us pledge ourselves to-night, boys, never more by word, or deed,\r\nIn our own fair homes, or elsewhere, help to plant the poison seed."\r\n\r\nSilence once again, but only for a moment\'s space, and then,\r\nIn one voice they all responded with a low and firm "Amen."\r\n\r\n    _Will Victor McGuire._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGod\'s Judgment on a Wicked Bishop\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer and autumn had been so wet,\r\nThat in winter the corn was growing yet.\r\n\'Twas a piteous sight to see all round\r\nThe grain lie rotting on the ground.\r\n\r\nEvery day the starving poor\r\nCrowded round Bishop Hatto\'s door,\r\nFor he had a plentiful last year\'s store,\r\nAnd all the neighborhood could tell\r\nHis granaries were furnish\'d well.\r\n\r\nAt last Bishop Hatto appointed a day\r\nTo quiet the poor without delay;\r\nHe bade them to his great barn repair,\r\nAnd they should have food for the winter there.\r\n\r\nRejoiced the tidings good to hear,\r\nThe poor folk flock\'d from far and near;\r\nThe great barn was full as it could hold\r\nOf women and children, and young and old.\r\n\r\nThen, when he saw it could hold no more,\r\nBishop Hatto he made fast the door,\r\nAnd while for mercy on Christ they call,\r\nHe set fire to the barn and burnt them all.\r\n\r\n"I\' faith, \'tis an excellent bonfire!" quoth he,\r\n"And the country is greatly obliged to me\r\nFor ridding it, in these times forlorn,\r\nOf rats that only consume the corn."\r\n\r\nSo then to his palace returned he,\r\nAnd he sat down to supper merrily,\r\nAnd he slept that night like an innocent man;\r\nBut Bishop Hatto never slept again.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, as he enter\'d the hall\r\nWhere his picture hung against the wall,\r\nA sweat like death all over him came,\r\nFor the rats had eaten it out of the frame.\r\n\r\nAs he look\'d, there came a man from his farm,\r\nHe had a countenance white with alarm:\r\n"My lord, I open\'d your granaries this morn,\r\nAnd the rats had eaten all your corn."\r\n\r\nAnother came running presently,\r\nAnd he was pale as pale could be.\r\n"Fly, my lord bishop, fly!" quoth he,\r\n"Ten thousand rats are coming this way,\r\nThe Lord forgive you for yesterday!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go to my tower on the Rhine," replied he;\r\n"\'Tis the safest place in Germany;\r\nThe walls are high, and the shores are steep\r\nAnd the stream is strong, and the water deep."\r\n\r\nBishop Hatto fearfully hasten\'d away,\r\nAnd he cross\'d the Rhine without delay,\r\nAnd reach\'d his tower and barr\'d with care\r\nAll the windows, doors, and loopholes there.\r\n\r\nHe laid him down and closed his eyes,\r\nBut soon a scream made him arise;\r\nHe started, and saw two eyes of flame\r\nOn his pillow, from whence the screaming came.\r\n\r\nHe listen\'d and look\'d,--it was only the cat,\r\nBut the bishop he grew more fearful for that,\r\nFor she sat screaming, mad with fear\r\nAt the army of rats that were drawing near.\r\n\r\nFor they have swum over the river so deep,\r\nAnd they have climb\'d the shores so steep,\r\nAnd up the tower their way is bent,\r\nTo do the work for which they were sent.\r\n\r\nThey are not to be told by the dozen or score;\r\nBy thousands they come, and by myriads and more;\r\nSuch numbers had never been heard of before,\r\nSuch a judgment had never been witness\'d of yore. |\r\n\r\nDown on his knees the bishop fell,\r\nAnd faster and faster his beads did he tell,\r\nAs louder and louder, drawing near,\r\nThe gnawing of their teeth he could hear.\r\n\r\nAnd in at the windows and in at the door,\r\nAnd through the walls helter-skelter they pour;\r\nAnd down from the ceiling and up through the floor,\r\n\r\nFrom the right and the left, from behind and before,\r\nFrom within and without, from above and below,--\r\nAnd all at once to the bishop they go.\r\n\r\nThey have whetted their teeth against the stones,\r\nAnd now they pick the bishop\'s bones;\r\nThey gnaw\'d the flesh from every limb,\r\nFor they were sent to do judgment on him!\r\n\r\n    _Robert Southey._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last Hymn\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sabbath day was ending in a village by the sea,\r\nThe uttered benediction touched the people tenderly,\r\nAnd they rose to face the sunset in the glowing, lighted west,\r\nAnd then hastened to their dwellings for God\'s blessed boon of rest.\r\n\r\nBat they looked across the waters, and a storm was raging there;\r\nA fierce spirit moved above them--the wild spirit of the air--\r\nAnd it lashed and shook and tore them till they thundered, groaned and\r\n     boomed,\r\nAnd, alas! for any vessel in their yawning gulfs entombed.\r\n\r\nVery anxious were the people on that rocky coast of Wales,\r\nLest the dawn of coming morrow should be telling awful tales,\r\nWhen the sea had spent its passion and should cast upon the shore\r\nBits of wreck and swollen victims as it had done heretofore.\r\n\r\nWith the rough winds blowing round her, a brave woman strained her eyes,\r\nAs she saw along the billows a large vessel fall and rise.\r\nOh, it did not need a prophet to tell what the end must be,\r\nFor no ship could ride in safety near that shore on such a sea!\r\n\r\nThen the pitying people hurried from their homes and thronged the beach.\r\nOh, for power to cross the waters and the perishing to reach!\r\nHelpless hands were wrung in terror, tender hearts grew cold with dread,\r\nAnd the ship, urged by the tempest, to the fatal rock-shore sped.\r\n\r\n"She\'s parted in the middle! Oh, the half of her goes down!"\r\n"God have mercy! Is his heaven far to seek for those who drown?"\r\nLo! when next the white, shocked faces looked with terror on the sea,\r\nOnly one last clinging figure on a spar was seen to be.\r\n\r\nNearer to the trembling watchers came the wreck tossed by the wave,\r\nAnd the man still clung and floated, though no power on earth could save.\r\n"Could we send him a short message? Here\'s a trumpet. Shout away!"\r\n\'Twas the preacher\'s hand that took it, and he wondered what to say.\r\n\r\nAny memory of his sermon? Firstly? Secondly? Ah, no!\r\nThere was but one thing to utter in that awful hour of woe.\r\nSo he shouted through the trumpet, "Look to Jesus!\r\nCan you hear?" And "Aye, aye, sir," rang the answer o\'er the waters loud\r\n          and clear.\r\n\r\nThen they listened,--"He is singing, \'Jesus, lover of my soul.\'"\r\nAnd the winds brought back the echo, "While the nearer waters roll."\r\nStrange, indeed, it was to hear him,--"Till the storm of life is past,"\r\nSinging bravely o\'er the waters, "Oh, receive my soul at last!"\r\n\r\nHe could have no other refuge,--"Hangs my helpless soul on thee."\r\n"Leave, ah! leave me not"--the singer dropped at last into the sea.\r\nAnd the watchers, looking homeward, through their eyes by tears made dim,\r\nSaid, "He passed to be with Jesus in the singing of that hymn."\r\n\r\n    _Marianne Faringham._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fence or an Ambulance\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed,\r\n  Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant;\r\nBut over its terrible edge there had slipped\r\n  A duke and full many a peasant.\r\nSo the people said something would have to be done,\r\n  But their projects did not at all tally;\r\nSome said, "Put a fence around the edge of the cliff,"\r\n  Some, "An ambulance down in the valley."\r\n\r\nBut the cry for the ambulance carried the day,\r\n  For it spread through the neighboring city;\r\nA fence may be useful or not, it is true,\r\n  But each heart became brimful of pity\r\nFor those who slipped over that dangerous cliff;\r\n  And the dwellers in highway and alley\r\nGave pounds or gave pence, not to put up a fence,\r\n  But an ambulance down in the valley.\r\n\r\n"For the cliff is all right, if you\'re careful," they said,\r\n  "And, if folks even slip and are dropping,\r\nIt isn\'t the slipping that hurts them so much,\r\n  As the shock down below when they\'re stopping."\r\nSo day after day, as these mishaps occurred,\r\n  Quick forth would these rescuers sally\r\nTo pick up the victims who fell off the cliff,\r\n  With their ambulance down in the valley.\r\n\r\nThen an old sage remarked: "It\'s a marvel to me\r\n  That people give far more attention\r\nTo repairing results than to stopping the cause,\r\n  When they\'d much better aim at prevention.\r\nLet us stop at its source all this mischief," cried he,\r\n  "Come, neighbors and friends, let us rally,\r\nIf the cliff we will fence, we might almost dispense\r\n  With the ambulance down in the valley."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s a fanatic," the others rejoined,\r\n  "Dispense with the ambulance? Never.\r\nHe\'d dispense with all charities, too, if he could;\r\n  No! No! We\'ll support them forever.\r\nAren\'t we picking up folks just as fast as they fall?\r\n  And shall this man dictate to us? Shall he?\r\nWhy should people of sense stop to put up a fence,\r\n  While the ambulance works in the valley?"\r\n\r\nBut a sensible few, who are practical too,\r\n  Will not bear with such nonsense much longer;\r\nThey believe that prevention is better than cure,\r\n  And their party will soon be the stronger.\r\nEncourage them then, with your purse, voice, and pen,\r\n  And while other philanthropists dally,\r\nThey will scorn all pretense and put up a stout fence\r\n  On the cliff that hangs over the valley.\r\n\r\nBetter guide well the young than reclaim them when old,\r\n  For the voice of true wisdom is calling,\r\n"To rescue the fallen is good, but \'tis best\r\n  To prevent other people from falling."\r\nBetter close up the source of temptation and crime,\r\n  Than deliver from dungeon or galley;\r\nBetter put a strong fence \'round the top of the cliff\r\n  Than an ambulance down in the valley."\r\n\r\n    _Joseph Malins._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Smack in School\r\n\r\n\r\nA district school, not far away,\r\n\'Mid Berkshire hills, one winter\'s day,\r\nWas humming with its wonted noise\r\nOf three-score mingled girls and boys;\r\nSome few upon their tasks intent,\r\nBut more on furtive mischief bent.\r\nThe while the master\'s downward look\r\nWas fastened on a copy-book;\r\nWhen suddenly, behind his back,\r\nRose sharp and clear a rousing smack!\r\nAs \'twere a battery of bliss\r\nLet off in one tremendous kiss!\r\n"What\'s that?" the startled master cries;\r\n"That, thir," a little imp replies,\r\n"Wath William Willith, if you pleathe,\r\nI thaw him kith Thuthanna Peathe!"\r\nWith frown to make a statue thrill,\r\nThe master thundered, "Hither, Will!"\r\nLike wretch o\'ertaken in his track\r\nWith stolen chattels on his back,\r\nWill hung his head in fear and shame,\r\nAnd to the awful presence came,--\r\nA great, green, bashful simpleton,\r\nThe butt of all good-natured fun,\r\nWith smile suppressed, and birch upraised\r\nThe threatener faltered, "I\'m amazed\r\nThat you, my biggest pupil, should\r\nBe guilty of an act so rude--\r\nBefore the whole set school to boot--\r\nWhat evil genius put you to \'t?"\r\n"\'Twas she, herself, sir," sobbed the lad;\r\n"I did not mean to be so bad;\r\nBut when Susanna shook her curls,\r\nAnd whispered I was \'fraid of girls,\r\nAnd dursn\'t kiss a baby\'s doll,\r\nI couldn\'t stand it, sir, at all,\r\nBut up and kissed her on the spot!\r\nI know--boo-hoo--I ought to not,\r\nBut, somehow, from her looks--boo-hoo--\r\nI thought she kind o\' wished me to!"\r\n\r\n    _William Pitt Palmer._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Woman\'s Question\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you know you have asked for the costliest thing\r\n  Ever made by the Hand above--\r\nA woman\'s heart and a woman\'s life,\r\n  And a woman\'s wonderful love?\r\n\r\nDo you know you have asked for this priceless thing\r\n  As a child might ask for a toy;\r\nDemanding what others have died to win,\r\n  With the reckless dash of a boy?\r\n\r\nYou have written my lesson of duty out,\r\n  Man-like you have questioned me--\r\nNow stand at the bar of my woman\'s soul,\r\n  Until I shall question thee.\r\n\r\nYou require your mutton shall always be hot,\r\n  Your socks and your shirts shall be whole.\r\nI require your heart to be true as God\'s stars,\r\n  And pure as heaven your soul.\r\n\r\nYou require a cook for your mutton and beef;\r\n  I require a far better thing--\r\nA seamstress you\'re wanting for stockings and shirts--\r\n  I look for a man and a king.\r\n\r\nA king for a beautiful realm called home,\r\n  And a man that the Maker, God,\r\nShall look upon as He did the first,\r\n  And say, "It is very good."\r\n\r\nI am fair and young, but the rose will fade\r\n  From my soft, young cheek one day--\r\nWill you love then, \'mid the falling leaves,\r\n  As you did \'mid the bloom of May?\r\n\r\nIs your heart an ocean so strong and deep\r\n  I may launch my all on its tide?\r\nA loving woman finds heaven or hell\r\n  On the day she is made a bride.\r\n\r\nI require all things that are grand and true,\r\n  All things that a man should be;\r\nIf you give this all, I would stake my life\r\n  To be all you demand of me.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot do this, a laundress and cook\r\n  You can hire with little to pay;\r\nBut a woman\'s heart and a woman\'s life\r\n  Are not to be won that way.\r\n\r\n    _Lena Lathrop._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLasca\r\n\r\n\r\nI want free life and I want fresh air;\r\nAnd I sigh for the canter after the cattle,\r\nThe crack of the whips like shots in battle,\r\nThe mellay of horns, and hoofs, and heads\r\nThat wars, and wrangles, and scatters, and spreads;\r\nThe green beneath and the blue above,\r\nAnd dash and danger, and life and love;\r\nAnd Lasca!\r\n           Lasca used to ride\r\nOn a mouse-gray mustang, close to my side,\r\nWith blue _serape_ and bright-belled spur;\r\nI laughed with joy as I looked at her!\r\nLittle knew she of books or creeds;\r\nAn _Ave Maria_ sufficed her needs;\r\nLittle she cared, save to be by my side,\r\nTo ride with me, and ever to ride,\r\nFrom San Saba\'s shore to Lavaca\'s tide.\r\nShe was as bold as the billows that beat,\r\nShe was as wild as the breezes that blow;\r\nFrom her little head to her little feet\r\nShe was swayed, in her suppleness, to and fro\r\nBy each gust of passion; a sapling pine,\r\nThat grows on the edge of a Kansas bluff\r\nAnd wars with the wind when the weather is rough,\r\nIs like this Lasca, this love of mine.\r\nShe would hunger that I might eat,\r\nWould take the bitter and leave me the sweet;\r\nBut once, when I made her jealous for fun,\r\nAt something I\'d whispered, or looked, or done,\r\nOne Sunday, in San Antonio,\r\nTo a glorious girl on the Alamo,\r\nShe drew from her girdle a dear little dagger,\r\nAnd--sting of a wasp!--it made me stagger!\r\nAn inch to the left or an inch to the right,\r\nAnd I shouldn\'t be maundering here to-night;\r\nBut she sobbed, and, sobbing, so swiftly bound\r\nHer torn _rebosa_ about the wound\r\nThat I quite forgave her. Scratches don\'t count\r\n  In Texas, down by the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nHer eye was brown,--a deep, deep brown;\r\nHer hair was darker than her eye;\r\nAnd something in her smile and frown,\r\nCurled crimson lip, and instep high,\r\nShowed that there ran in each blue vein,\r\nMixed with the milder Aztec strain,\r\nThe vigorous vintage of old Spain.\r\nShe was alive in every limb\r\n  With feeling, to the finger tips;\r\nAnd when the sun is like a fire,\r\nAnd sky one shining, soft sapphire,\r\n  One does not drink in little sips.\r\n\r\nThe air was heavy, the night was hot,\r\nI sat by her side, and forgot--forgot;\r\nForgot the herd that were taking their rest;\r\nForgot that the air was close opprest;\r\nThat the Texas norther comes sudden and soon,\r\nIn the dead of night or the blaze of noon;\r\nThat once let the herd at its breath take fright,\r\nThat nothing on earth can stop the flight;\r\nAnd woe to the rider, and woe to the steed,\r\nWho falls in front of their mad stampede!\r\nWas that thunder? No, by the Lord!\r\nI sprang to my saddle without a word,\r\nOne foot on mine, and she clung behind.\r\nAway on a hot chase down the wind!\r\nBut never was fox-hunt half so hard,\r\nAnd never was steed so little spared,\r\nFor we rode for our lives. You shall hear how we fared\r\n  In Texas, down by the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nThe mustang flew, and we urged him on;\r\nThere was one chance left, and you have but one;\r\nHalt, jump to the ground, and shoot your horse;\r\nCrouch under his carcass, and take your chance;\r\nAnd if the steers, in their frantic course,\r\nDon\'t batter you both to pieces at once,\r\nYou may thank your star; if not, good-by\r\nTo the quickening kiss and the long-drawn sigh,\r\nAnd the open air and the open sky,\r\n  In Texas, down by the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nThe cattle gained on us, and just as I felt\r\nFor my old six-shooter, behind in my belt,\r\nDown came the mustang, and down came we,\r\nClinging together, and--what was the rest?\r\nA body that spread itself on my breast,\r\nTwo arms that shielded my dizzy head,\r\nTwo lips that hard on my lips were pressed;\r\nThen came thunder in my ears,\r\nAs over us surged the sea of steers,\r\nBlows that beat blood into my eyes,\r\nAnd when I could rise,\r\nLasca was dead!\r\n\r\nI gouged out a grave a few feet deep,\r\nAnd there in Earth\'s arms I laid her to sleep!\r\nAnd there she is lying, and no one knows,\r\nAnd the summer shines and the winter snows;\r\nFor many a day the flowers have spread\r\nA pall of petals over her head;\r\nAnd the little gray hawk hangs aloft in the air,\r\nAnd the sly coyote trots here and there,\r\nAnd the black snake glides, and glitters, and slides\r\nInto the rift in a cotton-wood tree;\r\nAnd the buzzard sails on,\r\nAnd comes and is gone,\r\nStately and still like a ship at sea;\r\nAnd I wonder why I do not care\r\nFor the things that are like the things that were.\r\nDoes half my heart lie buried there\r\n  In Texas, down by the Rio Grande?\r\n\r\n    _Frank Desprez._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the Hill to the Poor-House\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the hill to the poor-house I\'m trudgin\' my weary way--\r\nI, a woman of seventy, and only a trifle gray--\r\nI, who am smart an\' chipper, for all the years I\'ve told,\r\nAs many another woman that\'s only half as old.\r\n\r\nOver the hill to the poor-house--I can\'t quite make it clear!\r\nOver the hill to the poor-house-it seems so horrid queer!\r\nMany a step I\'ve taken a-toiling to and fro,\r\nBut this is a sort of journey I never thought to go.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of heapin\' on me a pauper\'s shame?\r\nAm I lazy or crazy? Am I blind or lame?\r\nTrue, I am not so supple, nor yet so awful stout;\r\nBut charity ain\'t no favor, if one can live without.\r\n\r\nI am willin\' and anxious an\' ready any day\r\nTo work for a decent livin\', an\' pay my honest way;\r\nFor I can earn my victuals, an\' more too, I\'ll be bound,\r\nIf anybody only is willin\' to have me round.\r\n\r\nOnce I was young an\' han\'some--I was upon my soul--\r\nOnce my cheeks was roses, my eyes as black as coal;\r\nAnd I can\'t remember, in them days, of hearin\' people say,\r\nFor any kind of a reason, that I was in their way.\r\n\r\n\'Tain\'t no use of boastin\', or talkin\' over-free,\r\nBut many a house an\' home was open then to me;\r\nMany a han\'some offer I had from likely men,\r\nAnd nobody ever hinted that I was a burden then.\r\n\r\nAnd when to John I was married, sure he was good and smart,\r\nBut he and all the neighbors would own I done my part;\r\nFor life was all before me, an\' I was young an\' strong,\r\nAnd I worked the best that I could in tryin\' to get along.\r\n\r\nAnd so we worked together: and life was hard, but gay,\r\nWith now and then a baby for to cheer us on our way;\r\nTill we had half a dozen, an\' all growed clean an\' neat,\r\nAn\' went to school like others, an\' had enough to eat.\r\n\r\nSo we worked for the childr\'n, and raised \'em every one,\r\nWorked for \'em summer and winter just as we ought to\'ve done;\r\nOnly, perhaps, we humored \'em, which some good folks condemn--\r\nBut every couple\'s childr\'n\'s a heap the best to them.\r\n\r\nStrange how much we think of our blessed little ones!\r\nI\'d have died for my daughters, I\'d have died for my sons;\r\nAnd God he made that rule of love; but when we\'re old and gray,\r\nI\'ve noticed it sometimes, somehow, fails to work the other way.\r\n\r\nStrange, another thing: when our boys an\' girls was grown,\r\nAnd when, exceptin\' Charley, they\'d left us there alone;\r\nWhen John he nearer an\' nearer come, an\' dearer seemed to be,\r\nThe Lord of Hosts he come one day, an\' took him away from me.\r\n\r\nStill I was bound to struggle, an\' never to cringe or fall--\r\nStill I worked for Charley, for Charley was now my all;\r\nAnd Charley was pretty good to me, with scarce a word or frown,\r\nTill at last he went a-courtin\', and brought a wife from town.\r\n\r\nShe was somewhat dressy, an\' hadn\'t a pleasant smile--\r\nShe was quite conceity, and carried a heap o\' style;\r\nBut if ever I tried to be friends, I did with her, I know;\r\nBut she was hard and proud, an\' I couldn\'t make it go.\r\n\r\nShe had an edication, an\' that was good for her;\r\nBut when she twitted me on mine, \'twas carryin\' things too fur;\r\nAn\' I told her once, \'fore company (an\' it almost made her sick),\r\nThat I never swallowed a grammar, or eat a \'rithmetic.\r\n\r\nSo \'twas only a few days before the thing was done--\r\nThey was a family of themselves, and I another one;\r\nAnd a very little cottage one family will do,\r\nBut I never have seen a house that was big enough for two.\r\n\r\nAn\' I never could speak to suit her, never could please her eye,\r\nAn\' it made me independent, an\' then I didn\'t try;\r\nBut I was terribly staggered, an\' felt it like a blow,\r\nWhen Charley turn\'d agin me, an\' told me I could go.\r\n\r\nI went to live with Susan, but Susan\'s house was small,\r\nAnd she was always a-hintin\' how snug it was for us all;\r\nAnd what with her husband\'s sisters, and what with childr\'n three,\r\n\'Twas easy to discover that there wasn\'t room for me.\r\n\r\nAn\' then I went to Thomas, the oldest son I\'ve got,\r\nFor Thomas\'s buildings\'d cover the half of an acre lot;\r\nBut all the childr\'n was on me--I couldn\'t stand their sauce--\r\nAnd Thomas said I needn\'t think I was comin\' there to boss.\r\n\r\nAn\' then I wrote Rebecca, my girl who lives out West,\r\nAnd to Isaac, not far from her--some twenty miles, at best;\r\nAnd one of \'em said \'twas too warm there for any one so old,\r\nAnd t\'other had an opinion the climate was too cold.\r\n\r\nSo they have shirked and slighted me, an\' shifted me about--\r\nSo they have well-nigh soured me, an\' wore my old heart out;\r\nBut still I\'ve borne up pretty well, an\' wasn\'t much put down,\r\nTill Charley went to the poor-master, an\' put me on the town.\r\n\r\nOver the hill to the poor-house--my childr\'n dear, good-by!\r\nMany a night I\'ve watched you when only God was nigh;\r\nAnd God\'ll judge between us; but I will always pray\r\nThat you shall never suffer the half I do to-day.\r\n\r\n    _Will Carleton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Flag\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Freedom from her mountain height\r\n  Unfurled her standard to the air,\r\nShe tore the azure robe of night,\r\n  And set the stars of glory there.\r\nShe mingled with its gorgeous dyes\r\nThe milky baldric of the skies,\r\nAnd striped its pure celestial white\r\nWith streakings of the morning light;\r\nThen from his mansion in the sun\r\nShe called her eagle bearer down,\r\nAnd gave into his mighty hand\r\nThe symbol of her chosen land.\r\n\r\nMajestic monarch of the cloud,\r\n  Who rear\'st aloft thy regal form,\r\nTo hear the tempest trumpings loud\r\nAnd see the lightning lances driven,\r\n  When strive the warriors of the storm,\r\nAnd rolls the thunder-drum of heaven,\r\nChild of the sun! to thee \'tis given\r\n  To guard the banner of the free,\r\nTo hover in the sulphur smoke,\r\nTo ward away the battle stroke,\r\nAnd bid its blendings shine afar,\r\nLike rainbows on the cloud of War,\r\n  The harbingers of victory!\r\n\r\nFlag of the brave! thy folds shall fly,\r\nThe sign of hope and triumph high,\r\nWhen speaks the signal trumpet tone,\r\nAnd the long line comes gleaming on.\r\nEre yet the lifeblood, warm and wet,\r\nHas dimmed the glistening bayonet,\r\nEach soldier eye shall brightly turn\r\nTo where thy sky-born glories burn,\r\nAnd, as his springing steps advance,\r\nCatch war and vengeance from the glance.\r\n\r\nAnd when the cannon-mouthings loud\r\nHeave in wild wreaths the battle shroud,\r\nAnd gory sabres rise and fall\r\nLike shoots of flame on midnight\'s pall,\r\n  Then shall thy meteor glances glow,\r\nAnd cowering foes shall shrink beneath\r\n  Each gallant arm that strikes below\r\nThat lovely messenger of death.\r\n\r\nFlag of the seas! on ocean wave\r\nThy stars shall glitter o\'er the brave;\r\nWhen death, careering on the gale,\r\nSweeps darkly \'round the bellied sail,\r\nAnd frighted waves rush wildly back\r\nBefore the broadside\'s reeling rack,\r\nEach dying wanderer of the sea\r\nShall look at once to heaven and thee,\r\nAnd smile to see thy splendors fly\r\nIn triumph o\'er his closing eye.\r\n\r\nFlag of the free heart\'s hope and home!\r\n  By angel hands to valor given;\r\nThy stars have lit the welkin dome,\r\n  And all thy hues were born in heaven.\r\nForever float that standard sheet!\r\n  Where breathes the foe but falls before us,\r\nWith Freedom\'s soil beneath our feet,\r\n  And Freedom\'s banner streaming o\'er us?\r\n\r\n    _Joseph Rodman Drake._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGolden Keys\r\n\r\n\r\nA bunch of golden keys is mine\r\nTo make each day with gladness shine.\r\n\r\n"Good morning!" that\'s the golden key\r\nThat unlocks every door for me.\r\n\r\nWhen evening comes, "Good night!"

On the death of a\r\nmember of the family, the bees were at once informed of the event, and\r\ntheir hives dressed in mourning. This ceremonial was supposed to be\r\nnecessary to prevent the swarms from leaving their hives and seeking a\r\nnew home.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the place; right over the hill\r\n  Runs the path I took;\r\nYou can see the gap in the old wall still.\r\n  And the stepping-stones in the shallow brook.\r\n\r\nThere is the house, with the gate red-barred,\r\n  And the poplars tall;\r\nAnd the barn\'s brown length, and the cattle-yard,\r\n  And the white horns tossing above the wall.\r\n\r\nThere are the beehives ranged in the sun;\r\n  And down by the brink\r\nOf the brook are her poor flowers, weed-o\'errun,\r\n  Pansy and daffodil, rose and pink.\r\n\r\nA year has gone, as the tortoise goes,\r\n  Heavy and slow;\r\nAnd the same rose blows, and the same sun glows,\r\n  And the same brook sings of a year ago.\r\n\r\nThere\'s the same sweet clover-smell in the breeze;\r\n  And the June sun warm\r\nTangles his wings of fire in the trees,\r\n  Setting, as then, over Fernside farm.\r\n\r\nI mind me how with a lover\'s care\r\n  From my Sunday coat\r\nI brushed off the burs, and smoothed my hair,\r\n  And cooled at the brookside my brow and throat.\r\n\r\nSince we parted, a month had passed,--\r\n  To love, a year;\r\nDown through the beeches I looked at last\r\n  On the little red gate and the well-sweep near.\r\n\r\nI can see it all now,--the slantwise rain\r\n  Of light through the leaves,\r\nThe sundown\'s blaze on her window-pane,\r\n  The bloom of her roses under the eaves.\r\n\r\nJust the same as a month before,--\r\n  The house and the trees,\r\nThe barn\'s brown gable, the vine by the door,--\r\n  Nothing changed but the hives of bees.\r\n\r\nBefore them, under the garden wall,\r\n  Forward and back,\r\nWent drearily singing the chore-girl small,\r\n  Draping each hive with a shred of black.\r\n\r\nTrembling, I listened; the summer sun\r\n  Had the chill of snow;\r\nFor I knew she was telling the bees of one\r\n  Gone on the journey we all must go!\r\n\r\nThen I said to myself, "My Mary weeps\r\n  For the dead to-day:\r\nHaply her blind grandsire sleeps\r\n  The fret and pain of his age away."\r\n\r\nBut her dog whined low; on the doorway sill,\r\n  With his cane to his chin,\r\nThe old man sat; and the chore-girl still\r\n  Sung to the bees stealing out and in.\r\n\r\nAnd the song she was singing ever since\r\n  In my ear sounds on:--\r\n"Stay at home, pretty bees, fly not hence!\r\n  Mistress Mary is dead and gone!"\r\n\r\n    _John G. Whittier._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Not Understood"\r\n\r\n\r\nNot understood, we move along asunder,\r\n  Our paths grow wider as the seasons creep\r\nAlong the years. We marvel and we wonder,\r\n  Why life is life, and then we fall asleep,\r\n        Not understood.\r\n\r\nNot understood, we gather false impressions,\r\n  And hug them closer as the years go by,\r\nTill virtues often seem to us transgressions;\r\n  And thus men rise and fall and live and die,\r\n        Not understood.\r\n\r\nNot understood, poor souls with stunted visions\r\n  Often measure giants by their narrow gauge;\r\nThe poisoned shafts of falsehood and derision\r\n  Are oft impelled \'gainst those who mould the age,\r\n        Not understood.\r\n\r\nNot understood, the secret springs of action\r\n  Which lie beneath the surface and the show\r\nAre disregarded; with self-satisfaction\r\n  We judge our neighbors, and they often go\r\n        Not understood.\r\n\r\nNot understood, how trifles often change us--\r\n  The thoughtless sentence or the fancied slight--\r\nDestroy long years of friendship and estrange us,\r\n  And on our souls there falls a freezing blight--\r\n        Not understood.\r\n\r\nNot understood, how many hearts are aching\r\n  For lack of sympathy! Ah! day by day\r\nHow many cheerless, lonely hearts are breaking,\r\n  How many noble spirits pass away\r\n        Not understood.\r\n\r\nO God! that men would see a little clearer,\r\n  Or judge less hardly when they cannot see!\r\nO God! that men would draw a little nearer\r\n  To one another! They\'d be nearer Thee,\r\n        And understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomebody\'s Mother\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woman was old, and ragged, and gray,\r\nAnd bent with the chill of a winter\'s day;\r\nThe streets were white with a recent snow,\r\nAnd the woman\'s feet with age were slow.\r\n\r\nAt the crowded crossing she waited long,\r\nJostled aside by the careless throng\r\nOf human beings who passed her by,\r\nUnheeding the glance of her anxious eye.\r\n\r\nDown the street with laughter and shout,\r\nGlad in the freedom of "school let out,"\r\nCome happy boys, like a flock of sheep,\r\nHailing the snow piled white and deep;\r\nPast the woman, so old and gray,\r\nHastened the children on their way.\r\n\r\nNone offered a helping hand to her,\r\nSo weak and timid, afraid to stir,\r\nLest the carriage wheels or the horses\' feet\r\nShould trample her down in the slippery street.\r\n\r\nAt last came out of the merry troop\r\nThe gayest boy of all the group;\r\nHe paused beside her, and whispered low,\r\n"I\'ll help you across, if you wish to go."\r\n\r\nHer aged hand on his strong young arm\r\nShe placed, and so without hurt or harm,\r\nHe guided the trembling feet along,\r\nProud that his own were young and strong;\r\nThen back again to his friends he went,\r\nHis young heart happy and well content.\r\n\r\n"She\'s somebody\'s mother, boys, you know,\r\nFor all she\'s aged, and poor, and slow;\r\nAnd some one, some time, may lend a hand\r\nTo help my mother--you understand?--\r\nIf ever she\'s poor, and old, and gray,\r\nAnd her own dear boy is far away."\r\n\r\n"Somebody\'s mother" bowed low her head,\r\nIn her home that \'night, and the prayer she said\r\nWas: "God, be kind to that noble boy,\r\nWho is somebody\'s son, and pride and joy."\r\n\r\nFaint was the voice, and worn and weak,\r\nBut the Father hears when His children speak;\r\nAngels caught the faltering word,\r\nAnd "Somebody\'s Mother\'s" prayer was heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a Waterfowl\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whither, midst falling dew,\r\nWhile glow the heavens with the last steps of day,\r\nFar, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue\r\n  Thy solitary way?\r\n\r\n  Vainly the fowler\'s eye\r\nMight mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,\r\nAs, darkly seen against the crimson sky,\r\n  Thy figure floats along.\r\n\r\n  Seek\'st thou the plashy brink\r\nOf weedy lake, or marge of river wide,\r\nOr where the rocking billows rise and sink\r\n  On the chafed ocean-side?\r\n\r\n  There is a Power whose care\r\nTeaches thy way along that pathless coast--\r\nThe desert and illimitable air--\r\n  Lone wandering, but not lost.\r\n\r\n  All day thy wings have fanned,\r\nAt that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere;\r\nYet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,\r\n  Though the dark night is near.\r\n\r\n  And soon that toil shall end;\r\nSoon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,\r\nAnd scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,\r\n  Soon, o\'er thy sheltered nest.\r\n\r\n  Thou\'rt gone, the abyss of heaven\r\nHath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart\r\nDeeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,\r\n  And shall not soon depart.\r\n\r\n  He who, from zone to zone,\r\nGuides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,\r\nIn the long way that I must tread alone,\r\n  Will lead my steps aright.\r\n\r\n    _William Cullen Bryant._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Mother\r\n\r\n\r\nWho fed me from her gentle breast\r\nAnd hushed me in her arms to rest,\r\nAnd on my cheek sweet kisses prest?\r\n                        My mother.\r\n\r\nWhen sleep forsook my open eye,\r\nWho was it sung sweet lullaby\r\nAnd rocked me that I should not cry?\r\n                        My mother.\r\n\r\nWho sat and watched my infant head\r\nWhen sleeping in my cradle bed,\r\nAnd tears of sweet affection shed?\r\n                        My mother.\r\n\r\nWhen pain and sickness made me cry,\r\nWho gazed upon my heavy eye,\r\nAnd wept, for fear that I should die?\r\n                        My mother.\r\n\r\nWho ran to help me when I fell\r\nAnd would some pretty story tell,\r\nOr kiss the part to make it well?\r\n                        My mother.\r\n\r\nWho taught my infant lips to pray,\r\nTo love God\'s holy word and day,\r\nAnd walk in wisdom\'s pleasant way?\r\n                        My mother.\r\n\r\nAnd can I ever cease to be\r\nAffectionate and kind to thee\r\nWho wast so very kind to me,--\r\n                        My mother.\r\n\r\nOh, no, the thought I cannot bear;\r\nAnd if God please my life to spare\r\nI hope I shall reward thy care,\r\n                        My mother.\r\n\r\nWhen thou art feeble, old and gray,\r\nMy healthy arms shall be thy stay,\r\nAnd I will soothe thy pains away,\r\n                        My mother.\r\n\r\nAnd when I see thee hang thy head,\r\n\'Twill be my turn to watch thy bed,\r\nAnd tears of sweet affection shed,--\r\n                        My mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Walrus and the Carpenter\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining on the sea,\r\n  Shining with all his might:\r\nHe did his very best to make\r\n  The billows smooth and bright--\r\nAnd this was odd, because it was\r\n  The middle of the night.\r\n\r\nThe moon was shining sulkily,\r\n  Because she thought the sun\r\nHad got no business to be there\r\n  After the day was done--\r\n"It\'s very rude of him," she said,\r\n  "To come and spoil the fun!"\r\n\r\nThe sea was wet as wet could be,\r\n  The sands were dry as dry.\r\nYou could not see a cloud, because\r\n  No cloud was in the sky:\r\nNo birds were flying overhead--\r\n  There were no birds to fly.\r\n\r\nThe Walrus and the Carpenter\r\n  Were walking close at hand:\r\nThey wept like anything to see\r\n  Such quantities of sand:\r\n"If this were only cleared away,"\r\n  They said, "it would be grand!"\r\n\r\n"If seven maids with seven mops\r\n  Swept it for half a year,\r\nDo you suppose," the Walrus said,\r\n  "That they could get it clear?"\r\n"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,\r\n  And shed a bitter tear.\r\n\r\n"O Oysters, come and walk with us!"\r\n  The Walrus did beseech.\r\n"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,\r\n  Along the briny beach:\r\nWe cannot do with more than four,\r\n  To give a hand to each."\r\n\r\nThe eldest Oyster looked at him,\r\n  But never a word he said:\r\nThe eldest Oyster winked his eye,\r\n  And shook his heavy head--\r\nMeaning to say he did not choose\r\n  To leave the oyster-bed.\r\n\r\nBut four young Oysters hurried up,\r\n  All eager for the treat:\r\nTheir coats were brushed, their faces washed,\r\n  Their shoes were clean and neat--\r\nAnd this was odd, because, you know,\r\n  They hadn\'t any feet.\r\n\r\nFour other Oysters followed them,\r\n  And yet another four;\r\nAnd thick and fast they came at last,\r\n  And more, and more, and more--\r\nAll hopping through the frothy waves,\r\n  And scrambling to the shore.\r\n\r\nThe Walrus and the Carpenter\r\n  Walked on a mile or so,\r\nAnd then they rested on a rock\r\n  Conveniently low:\r\nAnd all the little Oysters stood\r\n  And waited in a row.\r\n\r\n"The time has come," the Walrus said,\r\n  "To talk of many things:\r\nOf shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--\r\n  Of cabbages and kings--\r\nAnd why the sea is boiling hot--\r\n  And whether pigs have wings."\r\n\r\n"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,\r\n  "Before we have our chat;\r\nFor some of us are out of breath,\r\n  And all of us are fat!"\r\n"No hurry!" said the Carpenter.\r\n  They thanked him much for that.\r\n\r\n"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,\r\n  "Is what we chiefly need:\r\nPepper and vinegar besides\r\n  Are very good indeed--\r\nNow, if you\'re ready, Oysters dear,\r\n  We can begin to feed."\r\n\r\n"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,\r\n  Turning a little blue.\r\n"After such kindness, that would be\r\n  A dismal thing to do!"\r\n"The night is fine," the Walrus said,\r\n  "Do you admire the view?\r\n\r\n"It was so kind of you to come!\r\n  And you are very nice!"\r\nThe Carpenter said nothing but\r\n  "Cut us another slice.\r\nI wish you were not quite so deaf--\r\n  I\'ve had to ask you twice!"\r\n\r\n"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,\r\n  "To play them such a trick.\r\nAfter we\'ve brought them out so far,\r\n  And made them trot so quick!"\r\nThe Carpenter said nothing but\r\n  "The butter\'s spread too thick!"\r\n\r\n"I weep for you," the Walrus said;\r\n  "I deeply sympathize."\r\nWith sobs and tears he sorted out\r\n  Those of the largest size,\r\nHolding his pocket-handkerchief\r\n  Before his streaming eyes.\r\n\r\n"O Oysters," said the Carpenter,\r\n  "You\'ve had a pleasant run!\r\nShall we be trotting home again?"\r\n  But answer came there none--\r\nAnd this was scarcely odd, because\r\n  They\'d eaten every one.\r\n\r\n    _Lewis Carroll._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Teacher\'s Dream\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weary teacher sat alone\r\n  While twilight gathered on:\r\nAnd not a sound was heard around,--\r\n  The boys and girls were gone.\r\n\r\nThe weary teacher sat alone;\r\n  Unnerved and pale was he;\r\nBowed \'neath a yoke of care, he spoke\r\n  In sad soliloquy:\r\n\r\n"Another round, another round\r\n  Of labor thrown away,\r\nAnother chain of toil and pain\r\n  Dragged through a tedious day.\r\n\r\n"Of no avail is constant zeal,\r\n  Love\'s sacrifice is lost.\r\nThe hopes of morn, so golden, turn,\r\n  Each evening, into dross.\r\n\r\n"I squander on a barren field\r\n  My strength, my life, my all:\r\nThe seeds I sow will never grow,--\r\n  They perish where they fall."\r\n\r\nHe sighed, and low upon his hands\r\n  His aching brow he pressed;\r\nAnd o\'er his frame ere long there came\r\n  A soothing sense of rest.\r\n\r\nAnd then he lifted up his face,\r\n  But started back aghast,--\r\nThe room, by strange and sudden change,\r\n  Assumed proportions vast.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a Senate-hall, and one\r\n  Addressed a listening throng;\r\nEach burning word all bosoms stirred,\r\n  Applause rose loud and long.\r\n\r\nThe \'wildered teacher thought he knew\r\n  The speaker\'s voice and look,\r\n"And for his name," said he, "the same\r\n  Is in my record book."\r\n\r\nThe stately Senate-hall dissolved,\r\n  A church rose in its place,\r\nWherein there stood a man of God,\r\n  Dispensing words of grace.\r\n\r\nAnd though he spoke in solemn tone,\r\n  And though his hair was gray,\r\nThe teacher\'s thought was strangely wrought--\r\n  "I whipped that boy to-day."\r\n\r\nThe church, a phantom, vanished soon;\r\n  What saw the teacher then?\r\nIn classic gloom of alcoved room\r\n  An author plied his pen.\r\n\r\n"My idlest lad!" the teacher said,\r\n  Filled with a new surprise;\r\n"Shall I behold his name enrolled\r\n  Among the great and wise?"\r\n\r\nThe vision of a cottage home\r\n  The teacher now descried;\r\nA mother\'s face illumed the place\r\n  Her influence sanctified.\r\n\r\n"A miracle! a miracle!\r\n  This matron, well I know,\r\nWas but a wild and careless child,\r\n  Not half an hour ago.\r\n\r\n"And when she to her children speaks\r\n  Of duty\'s golden rule,\r\nHer lips repeat in accents sweet,\r\n  My words to her at school."\r\n\r\nThe scene was changed again, and lo!\r\n  The schoolhouse rude and old;\r\nUpon the wall did darkness fall,\r\n  The evening air was cold.\r\n\r\n"A dream!" the sleeper, waking, said,\r\n  Then paced along the floor,\r\nAnd, whistling slow and soft and low,\r\n  He locked the schoolhouse door.\r\n\r\nAnd, walking home, his heart was full\r\n  Of peace and trust and praise;\r\nAnd singing slow and soft and low,\r\n  Said, "After many days."\r\n\r\n    _W.H. Venable._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Legend of Bregenz\r\n\r\n\r\nGirt round with rugged mountains, the fair Lake Constance lies;\r\nIn her blue heart reflected shine back the starry skies;\r\nAnd watching each white cloudlet float silently and slow,\r\nYou think a piece of heaven lies on our earth below!\r\n\r\nMidnight is there: and silence, enthroned in heaven, looks down\r\nUpon her own calm mirror, upon a sleeping town:\r\nFor Bregenz, that quaint city upon the Tyrol shore,\r\nHas stood above Lake Constance a thousand years and more.\r\n\r\nHer battlement and towers, from off their rocky steep,\r\nHave cast their trembling shadow for ages on the deep;\r\nMountain, and lake, and valley, a sacred legend know,\r\nOf how the town was saved, one night three hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nFar from her home and kindred, a Tyrol maid had fled,\r\nTo serve in the Swiss valleys, and toil for daily bread;\r\nAnd every year that fleeted so silently and fast,\r\nSeemed to bear farther from her the memory of the past.\r\n\r\nShe served kind, gentle masters, nor asked for rest or change;\r\nHer friends seemed no more new ones, their speech seemed no more strange;\r\nAnd when she led her cattle to pasture every day,\r\nShe ceased to look and wonder on which side Bregenz lay.\r\n\r\nShe spoke no more of Bregenz, with longing and with tears;\r\nHer Tyrol home seemed faded in a deep mist of years;\r\nShe heeded not the rumors of Austrian war and strife;\r\nEach day she rose, contented, to the calm toils of life.\r\n\r\nYet when her master\'s children would clustering round her stand,\r\nShe sang them ancient ballads of her own native land;\r\nAnd when at morn and evening she knelt before God\'s throne,\r\nThe accents of her childhood rose to her lips alone.\r\n\r\nAnd so she dwelt: the valley more peaceful year by year;\r\nWhen suddenly strange portents of some great deed seemed near.\r\nThe golden corn was bending upon its fragile stock,\r\nWhile farmers, heedless of their fields, paced up and down in talk.\r\n\r\nThe men seemed stern and altered, with looks cast on the ground;\r\nWith anxious faces, one by one, the women gathered round;\r\nAll talk of flax, or spinning, or work, was put away;\r\nThe very children seemed afraid to go alone to play.\r\n\r\nOne day, out in the meadow with strangers from the town,\r\nSome secret plan discussing, the men walked up and down,\r\nYet now and then seemed watching a strange uncertain, gleam,\r\nThat looked like lances \'mid the trees that stood below the stream.\r\n\r\nAt eve they all assembled, then care and doubt were fled;\r\nWith jovial laugh they feasted; the board was nobly spread.\r\nThe elder of the village rose up, his glass in hand,\r\nAnd cried, "We drink the downfall of an accursed land!\r\n\r\n"The night is growing darker,--ere one more day is flown,\r\nBregenz, our foeman\'s stronghold, Bregenz shall be our own!"\r\nThe women shrank in terror, (yet Pride, too, had her part,)\r\nBut one poor Tyrol maiden felt death within her heart.\r\n\r\nBefore her stood fair Bregenz, once more her towers arose;\r\nWhat were the friends beside her? Only her country\'s foes!\r\nThe faces of her kinsfolk, the days of childhood flown,\r\nThe echoes of her mountains, reclaimed her as their own!\r\n\r\nNothing she heard around her, (though shouts rang forth again,)\r\nGone were the green Swiss valleys, the pasture, and the plain;\r\nBefore her eyes one vision, and in her heart one cry,\r\nThat said, "Go forth, save Bregenz, and then, if need be, die!"\r\n\r\nWith trembling haste and breathless, with noiseless step, she sped;\r\nHorses and weary cattle were standing in the shed;\r\nShe loosed the strong white charger, that fed from out her hand,\r\nShe mounted, and she turned his head towards her native land.\r\n\r\nOut--out into the darkness--faster, and still more fast;\r\nThe smooth grass flies behind her, the chestnut wood is past;\r\nShe looks up; clouds are heavy: Why is her steed so slow?--\r\nScarcely the wind beside them can pass them as they go.\r\n\r\n"Faster!" she cries. "Oh, faster!" Eleven the church-bells chime;\r\n"O God," she cries, "help Bregenz, and bring me there in time!"\r\nBut louder than bells\' ringing, or lowing of the kine,\r\nGrows nearer in the midnight the rushing of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nShall not the roaring waters their headlong gallop check?\r\nThe steed draws back in terror, she leans upon his neck\r\nTo watch the flowing darkness,--the bank is high and steep;\r\nOne pause--he staggers forward, and plunges in the deep.\r\n\r\nShe strives to pierce the blackness, and looser throws the rein;\r\nHer steed must breast the waters that dash above his mane.\r\nHow gallantly, how nobly, he struggles through the foam,\r\nAnd see--in the far distance shine out the lights of home!\r\n\r\nUp the steep bank he bears her, and now they rush again\r\nToward the heights of Bregenz, that tower above the plain.\r\nThey reach the gate of Bregenz, just as the midnight rings,\r\nAnd out come serf and soldier to meet the news she brings.\r\n\r\nBregenz is saved! Ere daylight her battlements are manned;\r\nDefiance greets the army that marches on the land.\r\nAnd if to deeds heroic should endless fame be paid,\r\nBregenz does well to honor the noble Tyrol maid.\r\n\r\nThree hundred years are vanished, and yet upon the hill\r\nAn old stone gateway rises, to do her honor still.\r\nAnd there, when Bregenz women sit spinning in the shade,\r\nThey see in quaint old carving the charger and the maid.\r\n\r\nAnd when, to guard old Bregenz, by gateway, street, and tower,\r\nThe warder paces all night long, and calls each passing hour:\r\n"Nine," "ten," "eleven," he cries aloud, and then (O crown of fame!)\r\nWhen midnight pauses in the skies he calls the maiden\'s name!\r\n\r\n    _Adelaide A.

The man, he is not found\r\nTo marry such a worthless wench, these seven leagues around."\r\nBut Brier-Rose, she laughed and she trilled a merry lay:\r\n"Perhaps he\'ll come, my mother dear, from eight leagues away."\r\n\r\nThe good-wife with a "humph" and a sigh forsook the battle,\r\nAnd flung her pots and pails about with much vindictive rattle;\r\n"O Lord, what sin did I commit in youthful days, and wild,\r\nThat thou hast punished me in age with such a wayward child?"\r\n\r\nUp stole the girl on tiptoe, so that none her step could hear,\r\nAnd laughing pressed an airy kiss behind the good-wife\'s ear.\r\nAnd she, as e\'er relenting, sighed: "Oh, Heaven only knows\r\nWhatever will become of you, my naughty Brier-Rose!"\r\n\r\nThe sun was high and summer sounds were teeming in the air;\r\nThe clank of scythes, the cricket\'s whir, and swelling woodnotes rare,\r\nFrom fields and copse and meadow; and through the open door\r\nSweet, fragrant whiffs of new-mown hay the idle breezes bore.\r\n\r\nThen Brier-Rose grew pensive, like a bird of thoughtful mien,\r\nWhose little life has problems among the branches green.\r\nShe heard the river brawling where the tide was swift and strong,\r\nShe heard the summer singing its strange, alluring song.\r\n\r\nAnd out she skipped the meadows o\'er and gazed into the sky;\r\nHer heart o\'erbrimmed with gladness, she scarce herself knew why,\r\nAnd to a merry tune she hummed, "Oh, Heaven only knows\r\nWhatever will become of the naughty Brier-Rose!"\r\n\r\nWhene\'er a thrifty matron this idle maid espied,\r\nShe shook her head in warning, and scarce her wrath could hide;\r\nFor girls were made for housewives, for spinning-wheel and loom,\r\nAnd not to drink the sunshine and wild flower\'s sweet perfume.\r\n\r\nAnd oft the maidens cried, when the Brier-Rose went by,\r\n"You cannot knit a stocking, and you cannot make a pie."\r\nBut Brier-Rose, as was her wont, she cocked her curly head:\r\n"But I can sing a pretty song," full merrily she said.\r\n\r\nAnd oft the young lads shouted, when they saw the maid at play:\r\n"Ho, good-for-nothing Brier-Rose, how do you do to-day?"\r\nThen she shook her tiny fist; to her cheeks the color flew:\r\n"However much you coax me, I\'ll _never_ dance with you."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus flew the years light winged over Brier-Rose\'s head,\r\nTill she was twenty summers old and yet remained unwed.\r\nAnd all the parish wondered: "The Lord Almighty knows\r\nWhatever will become of that naughty Brier-Rose!"\r\n\r\nAnd while they wondered came the spring a-dancing o\'er the hills;\r\nHer breath was warmer than of yore, and all the mountain rills,\r\nWith their tinkling and their rippling and their rushing, filled the air,\r\nAnd the misty sounds of water forth-welling everywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd in the valley\'s depth, like a lusty beast of prey,\r\nThe river leaped and roared aloud and tossed its mane of spray;\r\nThen hushed again its voice to a softly plashing croon,\r\nAs dark it rolled beneath the sun and white beneath the moon.\r\n\r\nIt was a merry sight to see the lumber as it whirled\r\nAdown the tawny eddies that hissed and seethed and swirled,\r\nNow shooting through the rapids and, with a reeling swing,\r\nInto the foam-crests diving like an animated thing.\r\n\r\nBut in the narrows of the rocks, where o\'er a steep incline\r\nThe waters plunged, and wreathed in foam the dark boughs of the pine,\r\nThe lads kept watch with shout and song, and sent each straggling beam\r\nA-spinning down the rapids, lest it should lock the stream.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd yet--methinks I hear it now--wild voices in the night,\r\nA rush of feet, a dog\'s harsh bark, a torch\'s flaring light,\r\nAnd wandering gusts of dampness, and round us far and nigh,\r\nA throbbing boom of water like a pulse-beat in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe dawn just pierced the pallid east with spears of gold and red.\r\nAs we, with boat-hooks in our hands, toward the narrows sped.\r\nAnd terror smote us; for we heard the mighty tree-tops sway,\r\nAnd thunder, as of chariots, and hissing showers of spray.\r\n\r\n"Now, lads," the sheriff shouted, "you are strong, like Norway\'s rock:\r\nA hundred crowns I give to him who breaks the lumber lock!\r\nFor if another hour go by, the angry waters\' spoil\r\nOur homes will be, and fields, and our weary years of toil."\r\n\r\nWe looked each at the other; each hoped his neighbor would\r\nBrave death and danger for his home, as valiant Norsemen should.\r\nBut at our feet the brawling tide expanded like a lake,\r\nAnd whirling beams came shooting on, and made the firm rock quake.\r\n\r\n"Two hundred crowns!" the sheriff cried, and breathless stood the crowd.\r\n"Two hundred crowns, my bonny lads!" in anxious tones and loud.\r\nBut not a man came forward, and no one spoke or stirred,\r\nAnd nothing save the thunder of the cataract was heard.\r\n\r\nBut as with trembling hands and with fainting hearts we stood,\r\nWe spied a little curly head emerging from the wood.\r\nWe heard a little snatch of a merry little song,\r\nAnd saw the dainty Brier-Rose come dancing through the throng.\r\n\r\nAn angry murmur rose from the people round about.\r\n"Fling her into the river," we heard the matrons shout;\r\n"Chase her away, the silly thing; for God himself scarce knows\r\nWhy ever he created that worthless Brier-Rose."\r\n\r\nSweet Brier-Rose, she heard their cries; a little pensive smile\r\nAcross her fair face flitted that might a stone beguile;\r\nAnd then she gave her pretty head a roguish little cock:\r\n"Hand me a boat-hook, lads," she said; "I think I\'ll break the lock."\r\n\r\nDerisive shouts of laughter broke from throats of young and old:\r\n"Ho! good-for-nothing Brier-Rose, your tongue was ever bold."\r\nAnd, mockingly, a boat-hook into her hands was flung,\r\nWhen, lo! into the river\'s midst with daring leaps she sprung!\r\n\r\nWe saw her dimly through a mist of dense and blinding spray;\r\nFrom beam to beam she skipped, like a water-sprite at play.\r\nAnd now and then faint gleams we caught of color through the mist:\r\nA crimson waist, a golden head, a little dainty wrist.\r\n\r\nIn terror pressed the people to the margin of the hill,\r\nA hundred breaths were bated, a hundred hearts stood still.\r\nFor, hark! from out the rapids came a strange and creaking sound,\r\nAnd then a crash of thunder which shook the very ground.\r\n\r\nThe waters hurled the lumber mass down o\'er the rocky steep.\r\nWe heard a muffled rumbling and a rolling in the deep;\r\nWe saw a tiny form which the torrent swiftly bore\r\nAnd flung into the wild abyss, where it was seen no more.\r\n\r\nAh, little naughty Brier-Rose, thou couldst not weave nor spin;\r\nYet thou couldst do a nobler deed than all thy mocking kin;\r\nFor thou hadst courage e\'en to die, and by thy death to save\r\nA thousand farms and lives from the fury of the wave.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the adage lives, in the valley of thy birth,\r\nWhen wayward children spend their days in heedless play and mirth,\r\nOft mothers say, half smiling, half sighing, "Heaven knows\r\nWhatever will become of the naughty Brier-Rose!"\r\n\r\n    _Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Robert of Sicily\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane\r\nAnd Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,\r\nAppareled in magnificent attire\r\nWith retinue of many a knight and squire,\r\nOn St. John\'s eve, at vespers, proudly sat\r\nAnd heard the priests chant the Magnificat.\r\nAnd as he listened, o\'er and o\'er again\r\nRepeated, like a burden or refrain,\r\nHe caught the words, _"Deposuit potentes\r\nDe sede, et exaltavit humiles"_;\r\nAnd slowly lifting up his kingly head,\r\nHe to a learned clerk beside him said,\r\n"What mean those words?" The clerk made answer meet,\r\n"He has put down the mighty from their seat,\r\nAnd has exalted them of low degree."\r\nThereat King Robert muttered scornfully,\r\n"\'Tis well that such seditious words are sung\r\nOnly by priests, and in the Latin tongue;\r\nFor unto priests, and people be it known,\r\nThere is no power can push me from my throne,"\r\nAnd leaning back he yawned and fell asleep,\r\nLulled by the chant monotonous and deep.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, it was already night;\r\nThe church was empty, and there was no light,\r\nSave where the lamps, that glimmered few and faint,\r\nLighted a little space before some saint.\r\nHe started from his seat and gazed around,\r\nBut saw no living thing and heard no sound.\r\nHe groped towards the door, but it was locked;\r\nHe cried aloud, and listened, and then knocked,\r\nAnd uttered awful threatenings and complaints,\r\nAnd imprecations upon men and saints.\r\nThe sounds re-echoed from the roof and walls\r\nAs if dead priests were laughing in their stalls.\r\n\r\nAt length the sexton, hearing from without\r\nThe tumult of the knocking and the shout,\r\nAnd thinking thieves were in the house of prayer,\r\nCame with his lantern, asking "Who is there?"\r\nHalf choked with rage, King Robert fiercely said,\r\n"Open; \'tis I, the king! Art thou afraid?"\r\nThe frightened sexton, muttering with a curse,\r\n"This is some drunken vagabond, or worse!"\r\nTurned the great key and flung the portal wide;\r\nA man rushed by him at a single stride,\r\nHaggard, half-naked, without hat or cloak,\r\nWho neither turned, nor looked at him, nor spoke,\r\nBut leaped into the blackness of the night,\r\nAnd vanished like a spectre from his sight.\r\n\r\nRobert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane\r\nAnd Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,\r\nDespoiled of his magnificent attire,\r\nBare-headed, breathless, and besprent with mire,\r\nWith sense of wrong and outrage desperate,\r\nStrode on and thundered at the palace gate;\r\nRushed through the court-yard, thrusting in his rage\r\nTo right and left each seneschal and page,\r\nAnd hurried up the broad and sounding stair,\r\nHis white face ghastly in the torches\' glare.\r\nFrom hall to hall he passed with breathless speed;\r\nVoices and cries he heard, but did not heed,\r\nUntil at last he reached the banquet-room,\r\nBlazing with light, and breathing with perfume.\r\n\r\nThere on the dais sat another king,\r\nWearing his robes, his crown, his signet ring--\r\nKing Robert\'s self in features, form, and height,\r\nBut all transfigured with angelic light!\r\nIt was an angel; and his presence there\r\nWith a divine effulgence filled the air,\r\nAn exaltation, piercing the disguise,\r\nThough none the hidden angel recognize.\r\n\r\nA moment speechless, motionless, amazed,\r\nThe throneless monarch on the angel gazed,\r\nWho met his look of anger and surprise\r\nWith the divine compassion of his eyes!\r\nThen said, "Who art thou, and why com\'st thou here?"\r\nTo which King Robert answered with a sneer,\r\n"I am the king, and come to claim my own\r\nFrom an impostor, who usurps my throne!"\r\nAnd suddenly, at these audacious words,\r\nUp sprang the angry guests, and drew their swords;\r\nThe angel answered with unruffled brow,\r\n"Nay, not the king, but the king\'s jester; thou\r\nHenceforth shalt wear the bells and scalloped cape\r\nAnd for thy counselor shalt lead an ape;\r\nThou shalt obey my servants when they call,\r\nAnd wait upon my henchmen in the hall!"\r\n\r\nDeaf to King Robert\'s threats and cries and prayers,\r\nThey thrust him from the hall and down the stairs;\r\nA group of tittering pages ran before,\r\nAnd as they opened wide the folding door,\r\nHis heart failed, for he heard, with strange alarms,\r\nThe boisterous laughter of the men-at-arms,\r\nAnd all the vaulted chamber roar and ring\r\nWith the mock plaudits of "Long live the king!"\r\n\r\nNext morning, waking with the day\'s first beam,\r\nHe said within himself, "It was a dream!"\r\nBut the straw rustled as he turned his head,\r\nThere were the cap and bells beside his bed;\r\nAround him rose the bare, discolored walls,\r\nClose by, the steeds were champing in their stalls,\r\nAnd in the corner, a revolting shape,\r\nShivering and chattering, sat the wretched ape.\r\nIt was no dream; the world he loved so much\r\nHad turned to dust and ashes at his touch!\r\n\r\nDays came and went; and now returned again\r\nTo Sicily the old Saturnian reign;\r\nUnder the angel\'s governance benign\r\nThe happy island danced with corn and wine,\r\nAnd deep within the mountain\'s burning breast\r\nEnceladus, the giant, was at rest.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile King Robert yielded to his fate,\r\nSullen and silent and disconsolate.\r\nDressed in the motley garb that jesters wear,\r\nWith look bewildered, and a vacant stare,\r\nClose shaven above the ears, as monks are shorn,\r\nBy courtiers mocked, by pages laughed to scorn,\r\nHis only friend the ape, his only food\r\nWhat others left--he still was unsubdued.\r\nAnd when the angel met him on his way,\r\nAnd half in earnest, half in jest, would say,\r\nSternly, though tenderly, that he might feel\r\nThe velvet scabbard held a sword of steel,\r\n"Art thou the king?" the passion of his woe\r\nBurst from him in resistless overflow.\r\nAnd lifting high his forehead, he would fling\r\nThe haughty answer back, "I am, I am the king!"\r\n\r\nAlmost three years were ended, when there came\r\nAmbassadors of great repute and name\r\nFrom Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,\r\nUnto King Robert, saying that Pope Urbane\r\nBy letter summoned them forthwith to come\r\nOn Holy Thursday to his City of Rome.\r\nThe angel with great joy received his guests,\r\nAnd gave them presents of embroidered vests,\r\nAnd velvet mantles with rich ermine lined,\r\nAnd rings and jewels of the rarest kind.\r\nThen he departed with them o\'er the sea\r\nInto the lovely land of Italy,\r\nWhose loveliness was more resplendent made\r\nBy the mere passing of that cavalcade\r\nWith plumes, and cloaks, and housings, and the stir\r\nOf jeweled bridle and of golden spur.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! among the menials, in mock state,\r\nUpon a piebald steed, with shambling gait,\r\nHis cloak of foxtails flapping in the wind,\r\nThe solemn ape demurely perched behind,\r\nKing Robert rode, making huge merriment\r\nIn all the country towns through which they went.\r\n\r\nThe Pope received them with great pomp, and blare\r\nOf bannered trumpets, on St. Peter\'s Square,\r\nGiving his benediction and embrace,\r\nFervent, and full of apostolic grace.\r\nWhile with congratulations and with prayers\r\nHe entertained the angel unawares,\r\nRobert, the jester, bursting through the crowd,\r\nInto their presence rushed, and cried aloud:\r\n"I am the king! Look and behold in me\r\nRobert, your brother, King of Sicily!\r\nThis man, who wears my semblance to your eyes,\r\nIs an impostor in a king\'s disguise.\r\nDo you not know me? Does no voice within\r\nAnswer my cry, and say we are akin?"\r\nThe Pope in silence, but with troubled mien,\r\nGazed at the angel\'s countenance serene;\r\nThe Emperor, laughing, said, "It is strange sport\r\nTo keep a mad man for thy fool at court!"\r\nAnd the poor, baffled jester, in disgrace\r\nWas hustled back among the populace.\r\n\r\nIn solemn state the holy week went by,\r\nAnd Easter Sunday gleamed upon the sky;\r\nThe presence of the angel, with its light,\r\nBefore the sun rose, made the city bright,\r\nAnd with new fervor filled the hearts of men,\r\nWho felt that Christ indeed had risen again.\r\nEven the jester, on his bed of straw,\r\nWith haggard eyes the unwonted splendor saw;\r\nHe felt within a power unfelt before,\r\nAnd kneeling humbly on his chamber floor,\r\nHe heard the rustling garments of the Lord\r\nSweep through the silent air, ascending heavenward.\r\n\r\nAnd now the visit ending, and once more\r\nValmond returning to the Danube\'s shore,\r\nHomeward the angel journeyed, and again\r\nThe land was made resplendent with his train,\r\nFlashing along the towns of Italy\r\nUnto Salerno, and from thence by sea.\r\nAnd when once more within Palermo\'s wall,\r\nAnd, seated on the throne in his great hall,\r\nHe heard the Angelus from convent towers,\r\nAs if the better world conversed with ours,\r\nHe beckoned to King Robert to draw nigher,\r\nAnd with a gesture bade the rest retire.\r\nAnd when they were alone, the angel said,\r\n"Art thou the king?" Then, bowing down his head,\r\nKing Robert crossed both hands upon his breast,\r\nAnd meekly answered him, "Thou knowest best!\r\nMy sins as scarlet are; let me go hence,\r\nAnd in some cloister\'s school of penitence,\r\nAcross those stones that pave the way to heaven\r\nWalk barefoot till my guilty soul be shriven!"\r\n\r\nThe angel smiled, and from his radiant face\r\nA holy light illumined all the place,\r\nAnd through the open window, loud and clear,\r\nThey heard the monks chant in the chapel near,\r\nAbove the stir and tumult of the street,\r\n"He has put down the mighty from their seat,\r\nAnd has exalted them of low degree!"\r\nAnd through the chant a second melody\r\nRose like the throbbing of a single string:\r\n"I am an angel, and thou art the king!"\r\n\r\nKing Robert, who was standing near the throne,\r\nLifted his eyes, and lo! he was alone!\r\nBut all appareled as in days of old,\r\nWith ermined mantle and with cloth of gold;\r\nAnd when his courtiers came they found him there,\r\nKneeling upon the floor, absorbed in silent prayer.\r\n\r\n    _H.W. Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Huskers\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late in mild October, and the long autumnal rain\r\nHad left the summer harvest-fields all green with grass again;\r\nThe first sharp frosts had fallen, leaving all the woodlands gay\r\nWith the hues of summer\'s rainbow, or the meadow-flowers of May.\r\n\r\nThrough a thin, dry mist, that morning, the sun rose broad and red,\r\nAt first a rayless disk of fire, he brightened as he sped;\r\nYet, even his noontide glory fell chastened and subdued,\r\nOn the cornfields and the orchards, and softly pictured wood.\r\n\r\nAnd all that quiet afternoon, slow sloping to the night,\r\nHe wove with golden shuttle the haze with yellow light;\r\nSlanting through the painted beeches, he glorified the hill;\r\nAnd beneath it, pond and meadow lay brighter, greener still.\r\n\r\nAnd shouting boys in woodland haunts caught glimpses of that sky,\r\nFlecked by the many-tinted leaves, and laughed, they knew not why;\r\nAnd schoolgirls, gay with aster-flowers, beside the meadow brooks,\r\nMingled the glow of autumn with the sunshine of sweet looks.\r\n\r\nFrom spire and ball looked westerly the patient weathercock,\r\nBut even the birches on the hill stood motionless as rocks.\r\nNo sound was in the woodlands, save the squirrel\'s dropping shell,\r\nAnd the yellow leaves among the boughs, low rustling as they fell.\r\n\r\nThe summer grains were harvested; the stubble-fields lay dry,\r\nWhere June winds rolled, in light and shade, the pale green waves of rye;\r\nBut still, on gentle hill-slopes, in valleys fringed with wood,\r\nUngathered, bleaching in the sun, the heavy corn crop stood.\r\n\r\nBent low, by autumn\'s wind and rain, through husks that, dry and sere,\r\nUnfolded by their ripened charge, shone out the yellow ear;\r\nBeneath, the turnip lay concealed, in many a verdant fold,\r\nAnd glistened in the slanting light the pumpkin\'s sphere of gold.\r\n\r\nThere wrought the busy harvesters; and many a creaking wain\r\nBore slowly to the long barn-floor its load of husk and grain;\r\nTill broad and red, as when he rose, the sun sank down, at last,\r\nAnd like a merry guest\'s farewell, the day in brightness passed.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! as through the western pines on meadow, stream, and pond,\r\nFlamed the red radiance of a sky, set all afire beyond,\r\nSlowly o\'er the eastern sea-bluffs a milder glory shone,\r\nAnd the sunset and the moonrise were mingled into one!\r\n\r\nAs thus into the quiet night the twilight lapsed away,\r\nAnd deeper in the brightening moon the tranquil shadows lay;\r\nFrom many a brown old farm-house, and hamlet without name,\r\nTheir milking and their home-tasks done, the merry huskers came.\r\n\r\nSwung o\'er the heaped-up harvest, from pitchforks in the mow,\r\nShone dimly down the lanterns on the pleasant scene below;\r\nThe growing pile of husks behind, the golden ears before,\r\nAnd laughing eyes and busy hands and brown cheeks glimmering o\'er.\r\n\r\nHalf hidden in a quiet nook, serene of look and heart,\r\nTalking their old times over, the old men sat apart;\r\nWhile, up and down the unhusked pile, or nestling in its shade,\r\nAt hide-and-seek, with laugh and shout, the happy children played.\r\n\r\nUrged by the good host\'s daughter, a maiden young and fair,\r\nLifting to light her sweet blue eyes and pride of soft brown hair,\r\nThe master of the village school, sleek of hair and smooth of tongue,\r\nTo the quaint tune of some old psalm, a husking-ballad sung.\r\n\r\n    _John G. Whittier._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDarius Green and His Flying Machine\r\n\r\n\r\nIf ever there lived a Yankee lad,\r\nWise or otherwise, good or bad,\r\nWho, seeing the birds fly, didn\'t jump\r\nWith flapping arms from stake or stump,\r\n      Or, spreading the tail\r\n      Of his coat for a sail,\r\nTake a soaring leap from post or rail,\r\n      And wonder why\r\n      He couldn\'t fly,\r\nAnd flap and flutter and wish and try--\r\nIf ever you knew a country dunce\r\nWho didn\'t try that as often as once,\r\nAll I can say is, that\'s a sign\r\nHe never would do for a hero of mine.\r\n\r\nAn aspiring genius was D. Green:\r\nThe son of a farmer,--age fourteen;\r\nHis body was long and lank and lean,--\r\nJust right for flying, as will be seen;\r\nHe had two eyes, each bright as a bean,\r\nAnd a freckled nose that grew between,\r\nA little awry,--for I must mention\r\nThat he had riveted his attention\r\nUpon his wonderful invention,\r\nTwisting his tongue as he twisted the strings,\r\nWorking his face as he worked the wings,\r\nAnd with every turn of gimlet and screw\r\nTurning and screwing his mouth round, too,\r\n      Till his nose seemed bent\r\n      To catch the scent,\r\nAround some corner, of new-baked pies,\r\nAnd his wrinkled cheeks and his squinting eyes\r\nGrew puckered into a queer grimace,\r\nThat made him look very droll in the face,\r\n      And also very wise.\r\n\r\nAnd wise he must have been, to do more\r\nThan ever a genius did before,\r\nExcepting Daedalus of yore\r\nAnd his son Icarus, who wore\r\n      Upon their backs\r\n      Those wings of wax\r\nHe had read of in the old almanacs.\r\nDarius was clearly of the opinion\r\nThat the air is also man\'s dominion,\r\nAnd that, with paddle or fin or pinion,\r\n      We soon or late\r\n      Shall navigate\r\nThe azure as now we sail the sea.\r\nThe thing looks simple enough to me;\r\n      And if you doubt it,\r\nHear how Darius reasoned about it.\r\n\r\n      "Birds can fly,\r\n      An\' why can\'t I?\r\n      Must we give in,"\r\n      Says he with a grin,\r\n      "\'T the bluebird an\' phoebe\r\n      Are smarter\'n we be?\r\nJest fold our hands an\' see the swaller,\r\nAn\' blackbird an\' catbird beat us holler?\r\nDoes the leetle, chatterin\', sassy wren,\r\nNo bigger\'n my thumb, know more than men?\r\n      Jest show me that!\r\n      Er prove \'t the bat\r\nHas got more brains than\'s in my hat,\r\nAn\' I\'ll back down, an\' not till then!"\r\n\r\nHe argued further: "Ner I can\'t see\r\nWhat\'s ta\' use o\' wings to a bumblebee,\r\nFer to git a livin\' with, more\'n to me;--\r\n      Ain\'t my business\r\n      Important\'s his\'n is?\r\n      That Icarus\r\n      Was a silly cuss,--\r\nHim an\' his daddy Daedalus.\r\nThey might \'a\' knowed wings made o\' wax\r\nWouldn\'t stan\' sun-heat an\' hard whacks.\r\n      I\'ll make mine o\' luther,\r\n      Er suthin\' er other."\r\n\r\nAnd he said to himself, as he tinkered and planned:\r\n"But I ain\'t goin\' to show my hand\r\nTo mummies that never can understand\r\nThe fust idee that\'s big an\' grand.\r\n      They\'d \'a\' laft an\' made fun\r\nO\' Creation itself afore\'t was done!"\r\nSo he kept his secret from all the rest\r\nSafely buttoned within his vest;\r\nAnd in the loft above the shed\r\nHimself he locks, with thimble and thread\r\nAnd wax and hammer and buckles and screws,\r\nAnd all such things as geniuses use;--\r\nTwo bats for patterns, curious fellows!\r\nA charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows;\r\nAn old hoop-skirt or two, as well as\r\nSome wire and several old umbrellas;\r\nA carriage-cover, for tail and wings;\r\nA piece of harness; and straps and strings;\r\n      And a big strong boxs\r\n      In which he locks\r\nThese and a hundred other things.\r\n\r\nHis grinning brothers, Reuben and Burke\r\nAnd Nathan and Jotham and Solomon, lurk\r\nAround the corner to see him work,--\r\nSitting cross-legged, like a Turk,\r\nDrawing the waxed end through with a jerk,\r\nAnd boring the holes with a comical quirk\r\nOf his wise old head, and a knowing smirk.\r\nBut vainly they mounted each other\'s backs,\r\nAnd poked through knot-holes and pried through cracks;\r\nWith wood from the pile and straw from the stacks\r\nHe plugged the knot-holes and calked the cracks;\r\nAnd a bucket of water, which one would think\r\nHe had brought up into the loft to drink\r\n      When he chanced to be dry,\r\n      Stood always nigh,\r\n      For Darius was sly!\r\nAnd whenever at work he happened to spy\r\nAt chink or crevice a blinking eye,\r\nHe let a dipper of water fly.\r\n"Take that! an\' ef ever ye get a peep,\r\nGuess ye\'ll ketch a weasel asleep!"\r\n      And he sings as he locks\r\n      His big strong box:--\r\n\r\n"The weasel\'s head is small an\' trim,\r\nAn\' he is leetle an\' long an\' slim,\r\nAn\' quick of motion an\' nimble of limb,\r\n      An\' ef yeou\'ll be\r\n      Advised by me\r\nKeep wide awake when ye\'re ketchin\' him!"\r\n      So day after day\r\nHe stitched and tinkered and hammered away,\r\n      Till at last \'twas done,--\r\nThe greatest invention under the sun!\r\n"An\' now," says Darius, "hooray fer some fun!"\r\n\r\n      \'Twas the Fourth of July,\r\n      And the weather was dry,\r\nAnd not a cloud was on all the sky,\r\nSave a few light fleeces, which here and there,\r\n      Half mist, half air,\r\nLike foam on the ocean went floating by:\r\nJust as lovely a morning as ever was seen\r\nFor a nice little trip in a flying-machine.\r\n\r\nThought cunning Darius: "Now I sha\'n\'t go\r\nAlong \'ith the fellers to see the show.\r\nI\'ll say I\'ve got sich a terrible cough!\r\nAn\' then, when the folks \'ave all gone off\r\n      I\'ll hev full swing\r\n      For to try the thing,\r\nAn\' practyse a leetle on the wing."\r\n"Ain\'t goin\' to see the celebration?"\r\nSays Brother Nate. "No; botheration!\r\nI\'ve got sich a cold--a toothache--I--\r\nMy gracious!--feel\'s though I should fly!"\r\n\r\n      Said Jotham, "Sho!\r\n      Guess ye better go."\r\n      But Darius said, "No!\r\nShouldn\'t wonder \'f yeou might see me, though,\r\n\'Long \'bout noon, ef I git red\r\nO\' this jumpin\', thumpin\' pain \'n my head."\r\nFor all the while to himself he said:--\r\n      "I\'ll tell ye what!\r\nI\'ll fly a few times around the lot,\r\nTo see how \'t seems, then soon\'s I\'ve got\r\nThe hang o\' the thing, ez likely\'s not,\r\n      I\'ll astonish the nation,\r\n      And all creation,\r\nBy flyin\' over the celebration!\r\nOver their heads I\'ll sail like an eagle;\r\nI\'ll balance myself on my wings like a sea-gull;\r\nI\'ll dance on the chimbleys; I\'ll stan\' on the steeple;\r\nI\'ll flop up to winders an\' scare the people!\r\nI\'ll light on the libbe\'ty-pole, an\' crow;\r\nAn\' I\'ll say to the gawpin\' fools below,\r\n      \'What world\'s this \'ere\r\n      That I\'ve come near?\'\r\nFer I\'ll make \'em believe I\'m a chap f\'m the moon!\r\nAn\' I\'ll try a race \'ith their ol\' bulloon."\r\n      He crept from his bed;\r\nAnd, seeing the others were gone, he said,\r\nI\'m a-gittin\' over the cold \'n my head."\r\n      And away he sped,\r\nTo open the wonderful box in the shed.\r\n\r\nHis brothers had walked but a little way\r\nWhen Jotham to Nathan chanced to say,\r\n"What on airth is he up to, hey?"\r\n"Don\'o,--the\' \'s suthin\' er other to pay,\r\nEr he wouldn\'t \'a\' stayed to hum to-day."\r\nSays Burke, "His toothache\'s all \'n his eye!\r\n_He_ never\'d miss a Fo\'th-o\'-July,\r\nEf he hedn\'t some machine to try.\r\nLe\'s hurry back and hide in the barn,\r\nAn\' pay him fer tellin\' us that yarn!"\r\n"Agreed!" Through the orchard they creep back,\r\nAlong by the fences, behind the stack,\r\nAnd one by one, through a hole in the wall,\r\nIn under the dusty barn they crawl,\r\nDressed in their Sunday garments all;\r\nAnd a very astonishing sight was that,\r\nWhen each in his cobwebbed coat and hat\r\nCame up through the floor like an ancient rat.\r\n    And there they hid;\r\n    And Reuben slid\r\nThe fastenings back, and the door undid.\r\n    "Keep dark!" said he,\r\n"While I squint an\' see what the\' is to see."\r\n\r\nAs knights of old put on their mail,--\r\n    From head to foot\r\n    An iron suit,\r\nIron jacket and iron boot,\r\nIron breeches, and on the head\r\nNo hat, but an iron pot instead,\r\n    And under the chin the bail,--\r\nI believe they called the thing a helm;\r\nAnd the lid they carried they called a shield;\r\nAnd, thus accoutred, they took the field,\r\n    Sallying forth to overwhelm\r\nThe dragons and pagans that plagued the realm:--\r\n    So this modern knight\r\n    Prepared for flight,\r\nPut on his wings and strapped them tight;\r\nJointed and jaunty, strong and light;\r\nBuckled them fast to shoulder and hip,--\r\nTen feet they measured from tip to tip!\r\nAnd a helm had he, but that he wore,\r\nNot on his head like those of yore,\r\n    But more like the helm of a ship.\r\n\r\n    "Hush!" Reuben said,\r\n    "He\'s up in the shed!\r\nHe\'s opened the winder,--I see his head!\r\n    He stretches it out,\r\n    An\' pokes it about,\r\nLookin\' to see \'f the coast is clear,\r\n    An\' nobody near;--\r\nGuess he don\'o\' who\'s hid in here!\r\nHe\'s riggin\' a spring-board over the sill!\r\nStop laffin\', Solomon! Burke, keep still!\r\nHe\'s a climbin\' out now--of all the things!\r\nWhat\'s he got on? I van, it\'s wings!\r\nAn\' that t\'other thing? I vum, it\'s a tail!\r\nAn\' there he sets like a hawk on a rail!\r\nSteppin\' careful, he travels the length\r\nOf his spring-board, and teeters to try its strength.\r\nNow he stretches his wings, like a monstrous bat;\r\nPeeks over his shoulder, this way an\' that,\r\nFer to see \'f the\' \'s anyone passin\' by;\r\nBut the\' \'s on\'y a ca\'f an\' a goslin\' nigh.\r\n_They_ turn up at him a wonderin\' eye,\r\nTo see--The dragon! he\'s goin\' to fly!\r\nAway he goes! Jimmmy! what a jump!\r\n      Flop-flop-an\' plump\r\n      To the ground with a thump!\r\nFlutt\'rin an\' flound\'rin\', all in a lump!"\r\n\r\nAs a demon is hurled by an angel\'s spear,\r\nHeels over head, to his proper sphere,--\r\nHeels over head, and head over heels,\r\nDizzily down the abyss he wheels,--\r\nSo fell Darius. Upon his crown,\r\nIn the midst of the barnyard, he came down,\r\nIn a wonderful whirl of tangled strings,\r\nBroken braces and broken springs,\r\nBroken tail and broken wings,\r\nShooting-stars, and various things!\r\nAway with a bellow fled the calf,\r\nAnd what was that? Did the gosling laugh?\r\n      \'Tis a merry roar\r\n      From the old barn-door,\r\nAnd he hears the voice of Jotham crying,\r\n"Say, D\'rius! how de yeou like flyin\'?\r\nSlowly, ruefully, where he lay,\r\nDarius just turned and looked that way,\r\nAs he stanched his sorrowful nose with his cuff.\r\n"Wall, I like flyin\' well enough,"\r\nHe said; "but the\' ain\'t sich a thunder-in\' sight\r\nO\' fun in \'t when ye come to light."\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL\r\n\r\nI just have room for the moral here:\r\nAnd this is the moral,--Stick to your sphere.\r\nOr if you insist, as you have the right,\r\nOn spreading your wings for a loftier flight,\r\nThe moral is,--Take care how you light.\r\n\r\n    _John T. Trowbridge._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong of the Shirt\r\n\r\n\r\nWith fingers weary and worn,\r\n  With eyelids heavy and red,\r\nA woman sat, in unwomanly rags,\r\n  Plying her needle and thread--\r\nStitch! stitch! stitch!\r\n  In poverty, hunger and dirt,\r\nAnd still with a voice of dolorous pitch\r\n  She sang the "Song of the Shirt!"\r\n\r\n"Work! work! work!\r\n  While the cock is crowing aloof!\r\nAnd work--work--work,\r\n  Till the stars shine through the roof!\r\nIt\'s oh! to be a slave\r\n  Along with the barbarous Turk,\r\nWhere a woman has never a soul to save,\r\n   If this is Christian work!\r\n\r\n"Work--work--work,\r\n  Till the brain begins to swim;\r\nWork--work--work,\r\n  Till the eyes are heavy and dim!\r\nSeam, and gusset, and band,\r\n  Band, and gusset, and seam,\r\nTill over the buttons I fall asleep,\r\n  And sew them on in a dream!\r\n\r\n"O men, with sisters dear!\r\n  O men, with mothers and wives!\r\nIt is not linen you\'re wearing out,\r\n  But human creatures\' lives!\r\nStitch--stitch--stitch!\r\n  In poverty, hunger, and dirt,--\r\nSewing at once, with a double thread,\r\n  A shroud as well as a shirt!\r\n\r\n"But why do I talk of Death,--\r\n  That phantom of grisly bone?\r\nI hardly fear his terrible shape,\r\n  It seems so like my own,--\r\nIt seems so like my own,\r\n  Because of the fasts I keep;\r\nO God! that bread should be so dear,\r\n  And flesh and blood so cheap!\r\n\r\n"Work! work! work!\r\n  My labor never flags;\r\nAnd what are its wages? A bed of straw,\r\n  A crust of bread--and rags,\r\nThat shattered roof--this naked floor--\r\n  A table--a broken chair--\r\nAnd a wall so blank, my shadow I thank\r\n  For sometimes falling there!\r\n\r\n"Work--work--work!\r\n  From weary chime to chime!\r\nWork--work--work\r\n  As prisoners work for crime!\r\nBand, and gusset, and seam,\r\n  Seam, and gusset, and band,--\r\nTill the heart is sick and the brain benumbed,\r\n  As well as the weary hand.\r\n\r\n"Work--work--work!\r\n  In the dull December light!\r\nAnd Work--work--work!\r\n  When the weather is warm, and bright!\r\nWhile underneath the eaves\r\n  The brooding swallows cling,\r\nAs if to show me their sunny backs,\r\n  And twit me with the spring.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but to breathe the breath\r\n  Of the cowslip and primrose sweet,--\r\nWith the sky above my head,\r\n  And the grass beneath my feet!\r\nFor only one short hour\r\n  To feel as I used to feel,\r\nBefore I knew the woes of want\r\n  And the walk that costs a meal!\r\n\r\n"Oh, but for one short hour,--\r\n  A respite, however brief!\r\nNo blessed leisure for love or hope,\r\n  But only time for grief!\r\nA little weeping would ease my heart;\r\n  But in their briny bed\r\nMy tears must stop, for every drop\r\n  Hinders needle and thread!"\r\n\r\nWith fingers weary and worn,\r\n  With eyelids heavy and red,\r\nA woman sat, in unwomanly rags,\r\n  Plying her needle and thread,--\r\nStitch! stitch! stitch!\r\n  In poverty, hunger and dirt;\r\nAnd still with a voice of dolorous pitch--\r\nWould that its tone could reach the rich!--\r\n  She sang this "Song of the Shirt."\r\n\r\n    _Thomas Hood._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas Everywhere\r\n\r\n\r\nEverywhere, everywhere, Christmas to-night!\r\nChristmas in lands of the

showers for the thirsting flowers,\r\n  From the seas and the streams;\r\nI bear light shade for the leaves when laid\r\n  In their noon-day dreams.\r\nFrom my wings are shaken the dews that waken\r\n  The sweet buds every one,\r\nWhen rocked to rest on their mother\'s breast,\r\n  As she dances about the sun.\r\nI wield the flail of the lashing hail,\r\n  And whiten the green plains under,\r\nAnd then again I dissolve it in rain,\r\n  And laugh as I pass in thunder.\r\n\r\nI sift the snow on the mountains below,\r\n  And their great pines groan aghast;\r\nAnd all the night \'tis my pillow white,\r\n  While I sleep in the arms of the blast.\r\nSublime on the towers of my skyey bowers,\r\n  Lightning my pilot sits,\r\nIn a cavern under is fettered the thunder,\r\n  It struggles and howls at fits;\r\nOver earth and ocean, with gentle motion,\r\n  This pilot is guiding me,\r\nLured by the love of the genii that move\r\n  In the depths of the purple sea;\r\nOver the rills, and the crags, and the hills,\r\n  Over the lakes and the plains,\r\nWherever he dream, under mountain or stream,\r\n  The Spirit he loves remains;\r\nAnd I all the while bask in heaven\'s blue smile,\r\n  Whilst he is dissolving in rains.\r\n\r\nThe sanguine sunrise, with his meteor eyes,\r\n  And his burning plumes outspread,\r\nLeaps on the back of my sailing rack,\r\n  When the morning star shines dead;\r\nAs on the jag of a mountain crag,\r\n  Which an earthquake rocks and swings,\r\nAn eagle alit one moment may sit\r\n  In the light of its golden wings.\r\nAnd when sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,\r\n  Its ardors of rest and of love,\r\nAnd the crimson pall of eve may fall\r\n  From the depth of heaven above,\r\nWith wings folded I rest, on mine airy nest,\r\n  As still as a brooding dove.\r\n\r\nThat orbed maiden, with white fire laden,\r\n  Whom mortals call the moon,\r\nGlides glimmering o\'er my fleece-like floor,\r\n  By the midnight breezes strewn;\r\nAnd wherever the beat of her unseen feet,\r\n  Which only the angels hear,\r\nMay have broken the woof of my tent\'s thin roof,\r\n  The stars peep behind her and peer;\r\nAnd I laugh to see them whirl and flee,\r\n  Like a swarm of golden bees,\r\nWhen I widen the rent in my windbuilt tent,\r\n  Till the calm rivers, lakes, and seas,\r\nLike strips of the sky fallen thro\' me on high,\r\n  Are each paved with the moon and these.\r\n\r\nI bind the sun\'s throne with a burning zone,\r\n  And the moon\'s with a girdle of pearl;\r\nThe volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim,\r\n  When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.\r\nFrom cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,\r\n  Over a torrent sea,\r\nSunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof,\r\n  The mountains its columns be.\r\nThe triumphal arch thro\' which I march,\r\n  With hurricane, fire, and snow,\r\nWhen the powers of the air are chained to my chair,\r\n  Is the million-colored bow;\r\nThe sphere-fire above its soft colors wove,\r\n  Whilst the moist earth was laughing below.\r\n\r\nI am the daughter of earth and water,\r\n  And the nursling of the sky;\r\nI pass thro\' the pores of the ocean and shores;\r\n  I change, but I cannot die.\r\nFor after the rain, when, with never a stain\r\n  The pavilion of heaven is bare,\r\nAnd the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams\r\n  Build up the blue dome of air,\r\nI silently laugh at my own cenotaph,\r\n  And out of the caverns of rain,\r\nLike a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,\r\n  I arise and unbuild it again,\r\n\r\n    _Percy Bysshe Shelley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a Skylark\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hail to thee, blithe spirit!\r\n    Bird thou never wert,\r\n  That from heaven, or near it,\r\n    Pourest thy full heart\r\nIn profuse strains of unpremeditated art.\r\n\r\n  Higher still and higher\r\n    From the earth thou springest\r\n  Like a cloud of fire;\r\n    The blue deep thou wingest,\r\nAnd singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.\r\n\r\n  In the golden lightning\r\n    of the sunken sun,\r\n  O\'er which clouds are bright\'ning,\r\n    Thou dost float and run,\r\nLike an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.\r\n\r\n  The pale purple even\r\n    Melts around thy flight;\r\n  Like a star of heaven,\r\n    In the broad daylight\r\nThou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight:\r\n\r\n  Keen as are the arrows\r\n    Of that silver sphere\r\n  Whose intense lamp narrows\r\n    In the white dawn clear.\r\nUntil we hardly see, we feel, that it is there.\r\n\r\n  All the earth and air\r\n    With thy voice is loud,\r\n  As, when night is bare,\r\n    From one lonely cloud\r\nThe moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflowed.\r\n\r\n  What thou art we know not;\r\n    What is most like thee?\r\n  From rainbow clouds there flow not\r\n    Drops so bright to see,\r\nAs from thy presence showers a rain of melody:--\r\n\r\n  Like a poet hidden\r\n    In the light of thought,\r\n  Singing hymns unbidden,\r\n    Till the world is wrought\r\nTo sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:\r\n\r\n  Like a high-born maiden\r\n    In a palace-tower,\r\n  Soothing her love-laden\r\n    Soul in secret hour\r\nWith music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:\r\n\r\n  Like a glow-worm golden\r\n    In a dell of dew,\r\n  Scattering unbeholden\r\n    Its aerial hue\r\nAmong the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:\r\n\r\n  Like a rose embowered\r\n    In its own green leaves,\r\n  By warm winds deflowered,\r\n    Till the scent it gives\r\nMakes faint with too much sweet these heavy-winged thieves:\r\n\r\n  Sound of vernal showers\r\n    On the twinkling grass,\r\n  Rain-awakened flowers,\r\n    All that ever was\r\nJoyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass.\r\n\r\n  Teach us, sprite or bird,\r\n    What sweet thoughts are thine:\r\n  I have never heard\r\n    Praise of love or wine\r\nThat panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.\r\n\r\n  Chorus Hymeneal,\r\n    Or triumphal chaunt,\r\n  Matched with thine would be all\r\n    But an empty vaunt,\r\nA thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.\r\n\r\n  What objects are the fountains\r\n    Of thy happy strain?\r\n  What fields, or waves, or mountains?\r\n    What shapes of sky or plain?\r\nWhat love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?\r\n\r\n  With thy clear keen joyance\r\n    Languor cannot be:\r\n  Shadow of annoyance\r\n    Never came near thee:\r\nThou lovest: but ne\'er knew love\'s sad satiety.\r\n\r\n  Waking or asleep,\r\n    Thou of death must deem\r\n  Things more true and deep\r\n    Than we mortals dream,\r\nOr how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?\r\n\r\n  We look before and after\r\n    And pine for what is not:\r\n  Our sincerest laughter\r\n    With some pain is fraught;\r\nOur sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.\r\n\r\n  Yet if we could scorn\r\n    Hate, and pride, and fear;\r\n  If we were things born\r\n    Not to a shed a tear,\r\nI know not how thy joy we ever should come near.\r\n\r\n  Better than all measures\r\n    Of delightful sound,\r\n  Better than all treasures\r\n    That in books are found.\r\nThy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!\r\n\r\n  Teach me half the gladness\r\n    That thy brain must know,\r\n  Such harmonious madness\r\n    From my lips would flow,\r\nThe world should listen then, as I am listening now,\r\n\r\n    _Percy Bysshe Shelley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Brook\r\n\r\n\r\nI come from haunts of coot and hern,\r\nI make a sudden sally,\r\nAnd sparkle out among the fern,\r\nTo bicker down a valley.\r\n\r\nBy thirty hills I hurry down,\r\nOr slip between the ridges,\r\nBy twenty thorps, a little town,\r\nAnd half a hundred bridges.\r\n\r\nTill last by Philip\'s farm I flow\r\nTo join the brimming river,\r\nFor men may come and men may go,\r\nBut I go on forever.\r\n\r\nI chatter over stony ways,\r\nIn little sharps and trebles,\r\nI bubble into eddying bays,\r\nI babble on the pebbles.\r\n\r\nWith many a curve my banks I fret\r\nBy many a field and fallow,\r\nAnd many a fairy foreland set\r\nWith willow-weed and mallow.\r\n\r\nI chatter, chatter as I flow\r\nTo join the brimming river,\r\nFor men may come and men may go,\r\nBut I go on forever.\r\n\r\nI wind about, and in and out,\r\nWith here a blossom sailing,\r\nAnd here and there a lusty trout,\r\nAnd here and there a grayling,\r\n\r\nAnd here and there a foamy flake\r\nUpon me as I travel\r\nWith many a silvery waterbreak\r\nAbove the golden gravel,\r\n\r\nAnd draw them all along, and flow\r\nTo join the brimming river,\r\nFor men may come and men may go,\r\nBut I go on forever.\r\n\r\nI steal by lawns and grassy plots,\r\nI slide by hazel covers;\r\nI move the sweet forget-me-nots\r\nThat grow for happy lovers.\r\n\r\nI slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,\r\nAmong my skimming swallows;\r\nI make the netted sunbeam dance\r\nAgainst my sandy shallows.\r\n\r\nI murmur under moon and stars,\r\nIn brambly wildernesses;\r\nI linger by my shingly bars;\r\nI loiter round my cresses;\r\n\r\nAnd out again I curve and flow\r\nTo join the brimming river,\r\nFor men may come and men may go,\r\nBut I go on forever.\r\n\r\n    _Alfred, Lord Tennyson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune\r\n\r\n(_From "The Vision of Sir Launfal"_)\r\n\r\n\r\nNo price is set on the lavish summer,\r\nJune may be had by the poorest comer.\r\n\r\nAnd what is so rare as a day in June?\r\n  Then, if ever, come perfect days;\r\nThen Heaven tries earth if it be in tune,\r\n  And over it softly her warm ear lays;\r\nWhether we look, or whether we listen,\r\nWe hear life murmur, or see it glisten;\r\nEvery clod feels a stir of might,\r\n  An instinct within it that reaches and towers,\r\nAnd, groping blindly above it for light,\r\n  Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers;\r\nThe flush of life may well be seen\r\n  Thrilling back over hills and valleys;\r\nThe cowslip startles in meadows green,\r\n  The buttercup catches the sun in its chalice,\r\nAnd there\'s never a leaf nor a blade too mean\r\n  To be some happy creature\'s palace;\r\nThe little bird sits at his door in the sun,\r\n  Atilt like a blossom among the leaves,\r\nAnd lets his illumined being o\'errun\r\n  With the deluge of summer it receives;\r\nHis mate feels the eggs beneath her wings,\r\nAnd the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings;\r\nHe sings to the wide world, and she to her nest,--\r\nIn the nice ear of Nature, which song is the best?\r\n\r\nNow is the high-tide of the year,\r\n  And whatever of life hath ebbed away\r\nComes flooding back, with a ripply cheer,\r\n  Into every bare inlet and creek and bay;\r\nNow the heart is so full that a drop overfills it,\r\nWe are happy now because God wills it;\r\nNo matter how barren the past may have been,\r\n\'T is enough for us now that the leaves are green;\r\nWe sit in the warm shade and feel right well\r\nHow the sap creeps up and the blossoms swell;\r\nWe may shut our eyes, but we cannot help knowing\r\nThat skies are clear and grass is growing;\r\nThe breeze comes whispering in our ear,\r\nThat dandelions are blossoming near,\r\n  That maize has sprouted, that streams are flowing,\r\nThat the river is bluer than the sky,\r\nThat the robin is plastering his house hard by;\r\nAnd if the breeze kept the good news back,\r\nFor other couriers we should not lack;\r\n  We could guess it all by yon heifer\'s lowing,--\r\nAnd hark! how clear bold chanticleer,\r\nWarmed with the new wine of the year,\r\n  Tells all in his lusty crowing!\r\n\r\nJoy comes, grief goes, we know not how;\r\nEverything is happy now,\r\n  Everything is upward striving;\r\n\'T is as easy now for the heart to be true\r\nAs for grass to be green or skies to be blue,--\r\n  \'T is the natural way of living.\r\nWho knows whither the clouds have fled?\r\n  In the unscarred heaven they leave no wake,\r\nAnd the eyes forget the tears they have shed,\r\n  The heart forgets its sorrow and ache;\r\nThe soul partakes the season\'s youth,\r\n  And the sulphurous rifts of passion and woe\r\nLie deep \'neath a silence pure and smooth,\r\n  Like burnt-out craters healed with snow.\r\n\r\n    _James Russell Lowell._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Planting of the Apple-Tree\r\n\r\n\r\n  Come, let us plant the apple-tree.\r\nCleave the tough greensward with the spade;\r\nWide let its hollow bed be made;\r\nThere gently lay the roots, and there\r\nSift the dark mould with kindly care.\r\n  And press it o\'er them tenderly,\r\nAs round the sleeping infant\'s feet\r\nWe softly fold the cradle-sheet;\r\n  So plant we the apple tree.\r\n\r\n  What plant we in this apple-tree?\r\nBuds, which the breath of summer days\r\nShall lengthen into leafy sprays;\r\nBoughs where the thrush with crimson breast\r\nShall haunt, and sing, and hide her nest;\r\n  We plant, upon the sunny lea,\r\nA shadow for the noontide hour,\r\nA shelter from the summer shower,\r\n  When we plant the apple-tree.\r\n\r\n  What plant we in this apple-tree?\r\nSweets for a hundred flowery springs,\r\nTo load the May-wind\'s restless wings,\r\nWhen, from the orchard row, he pours\r\nIts fragrance through our open doors;\r\n  A world of blossoms for the bee,\r\nFlowers for the sick girl\'s silent room,\r\nFor the glad infant sprigs of bloom,\r\n  We plant with the apple-tree.\r\n\r\n  What plant we in this apple-tree?\r\nFruits that shall swell in sunny June,\r\nAnd redden in the August noon,\r\nAnd drop, when gentle airs come by,\r\nThat fan the blue September sky.\r\n  While children come, with cries of glee,\r\nAnd seek them where the fragrant grass\r\nBetrays their bed to those who pass,\r\n  At the foot of the apple tree.\r\n\r\n  And when, above this apple tree,\r\nThe winter stars are quivering bright,\r\nAnd winds go howling through the night,\r\nGirls, whose young eyes o\'erflow with mirth,\r\nShall peel its fruit by cottage hearth,\r\n  And guests in prouder homes shall see,\r\nHeaped with the grape of Cintra\'s vine,\r\nAnd golden orange of the Line,\r\n  The fruit of the apple-tree.\r\n\r\n  The fruitage of this apple-tree\r\nWinds, and our flag of stripe and star\r\nShall bear to coasts that lie afar,\r\nWhere men shall wonder at the view,\r\nAnd ask in what fair groves they grew;\r\n  And sojourners beyond the sea\r\nShall think of childhood\'s careless day\r\nAnd long, long hours of summer play,\r\n  In the shade of the apple-tree.\r\n\r\nEach year shall give this apple-tree\r\nA broader flush of roseate bloom,\r\nA deeper maze of verdurous gloom,\r\nAnd loosen, when the frost-clouds lower,\r\nThe crisp brown leaves in thicker shower.\r\n  The years shall come and pass, but we\r\nShall hear no longer, where we lie,\r\nThe summer\'s songs, the autumn\'s sigh,\r\n  In the boughs of the apple-tree.\r\n\r\n  And time shall waste this apple tree.\r\nOh, when its aged branches throw\r\nThin shadows on the ground below,\r\nShall fraud and force and iron will\r\nOppress the weak and helpless still?\r\n  What shall the tasks of mercy be,\r\nAmid the toils, the strifes, the tears\r\nOf those who live when length of years\r\n  Is wasting this apple-tree?\r\n\r\n  "Who planted this old apple-tree?"\r\nThe children of that distant day\r\nThus to some aged man shall say;\r\nAnd, gazing on its mossy stem,\r\nThe gray-haired man shall answer them:\r\n  "A poet of the land was he,\r\nBorn in the rude but good old times;\r\n\'Tis said he made some quaint old rhymes\r\n  On planting the apple-tree."\r\n\r\n    _William Cullen Bryant._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacter of the Happy Warrior\r\n\r\n\r\nWho is the happy Warrior? Who is he\r\nThat every man in arms should wish to be?\r\n--It is the generous Spirit, who, when brought\r\nAmong the tasks of real life, hath wrought\r\nUpon the plan that pleased his boyish thought:\r\nWhose high endeavors are an inward light\r\nThat makes the path before him always bright:\r\nWho, with a natural instinct to discern\r\nWhat knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn;\r\nAbides by this resolve, and stops not there,\r\nBut makes his moral being his prime care;\r\nWho, doomed to go in company with Pain,\r\nAnd Fear, and Bloodshed, miserable train!\r\nTurns his necessity to glorious gain;\r\nIn face of these doth exercise a power\r\nWhich is our human nature\'s highest dower;\r\nControls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves\r\nOf their bad influence, and their good receives:\r\nBy objects, which might force the soul to abate\r\nHer feeling, rendered more compassionate;\r\nIs placable--because occasions rise\r\nSo often that demand such sacrifice;\r\nMore skillful in self-knowledge, even more pure,\r\nAs tempted more; more able to endure,\r\nAs more exposed to suffering and distress;\r\nThence also, more alive to tenderness.\r\n--\'Tis he whose law is reason; who depends\r\nUpon that law as on the best of friends;\r\nWhence, in a state where men are tempted still\r\nTo evil for a guard against worse ill,\r\nAnd what in quality or act is best\r\nDoth seldom on a right foundation rest,\r\nHe labors good on good to fix, and owes\r\nTo virtue every triumph that he knows:\r\n--Who, if he rise to station of command,\r\nRises by open means; and there will stand\r\nOn honorable terms, or else retire,\r\nAnd in himself possess his own desire;\r\nWho comprehends his trust, and to the same\r\nKeeps faithful with a singleness of aim;\r\nAnd therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait\r\nFor wealth, or honors, or for worldly state;\r\nWhom they must follow; on whose head must fall,\r\nLike showers of manna, if they come at all;\r\nWhose powers shed round him in the common strife,\r\nOr mild concerns of ordinary life,\r\nA constant influence, a peculiar grace;\r\nBut who, if he be called upon to face\r\nSome awful moment to which Heaven has joined\r\nGreat issues, good or bad for human kind,\r\nIs happy as a Lover; and attired\r\nWith sudden brightness, like a Man inspired;\r\nAnd, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law\r\nIn calmness made, and sees what he foresaw;\r\nOr if an unexpected call succeed,\r\nCome when it will, is equal to the need:\r\n--He who, though thus endued as with a sense\r\nAnd faculty for storm and turbulence,\r\nIs yet a Soul whose master-bias leans\r\nTo homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes;\r\nSweet images! which, wheresoe\'er he be,\r\nAre at his heart; and such fidelity\r\nIt is his darling passion to approve;\r\nMore brave for this, that he hath much to love:--\r\n\'Tis, finally, the Man who lifted high,\r\nConspicuous object in a Nation\'s eye,\r\nOr left unthought-of in obscurity,--\r\nWho, with a toward or untoward lot,\r\nProsperous or adverse, to his wish or not--\r\nPlays, in the many games of life, that one\r\nWhere what he most doth value must be won:\r\nWhom neither shape of danger can dismay,\r\nNor thought of tender happiness betray;\r\nWho, not content that former worth stand fast,\r\nLooks forward, persevering to the last,\r\nFrom well to better, daily self-surpast:\r\nWho, whether praise of him must walk the earth\r\nForever, and to noble deeds give birth,\r\nOr he must fall, to sleep without his fame,\r\nAnd leave a dead unprofitable name--\r\nFinds comfort in himself and in his cause;\r\nAnd, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws\r\nHis breath in confidence of Heaven\'s applause:\r\nThis is the happy Warrior; this is He\r\nThat every Man in arms should wish to be.\r\n\r\n    _William Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Charge of the Light Brigade\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf a league, half a league,\r\n  Half a league onward,\r\nAll in the valley of Death\r\n  Rode the six hundred.\r\n"Forward, the Light Brigade!\r\nCharge for the guns," he said:\r\nInto the valley of Death\r\n  Rode the six hundred.\r\n\r\n"Forward, the Light Brigade!"\r\nWas there a man dismay\'d?\r\nNot tho\' the soldier knew\r\n  Some one had blunder\'d:\r\nTheirs not to make reply,\r\nTheirs not to reason why,\r\nTheirs but to do and die:\r\nInto the valley of Death\r\n  Rode the six hundred.\r\n\r\nCannon to right of them,\r\nCannon to left of them,\r\nCannon in front of them\r\n  Volley\'d and thunder\'d;\r\nStorm\'d at with shot and shell,\r\nBoldly they rode and well,\r\nInto the jaws of Death,\r\nInto the mouth of Hell\r\n  Rode the six hundred,\r\n\r\nFlash\'d all their sabres bare,\r\nFlash\'d as they turn\'d in air,\r\nSabring the gunners there,\r\nCharging an army, while\r\n  All the world wonder\'d:\r\nPlung\'d in the battery-smoke\r\nRight thro\' the line they broke;\r\nCossack and Russian\r\nReel\'d from the sabre-stroke\r\n  Shatter\'d and sunder\'d.\r\nThen they rode back, but not,--\r\n  Not the six hundred.\r\n\r\nCannon to right of them,\r\nCannon to left of them,\r\nCannon behind them\r\n  Volley\'d and thunder\'d;\r\nStorm\'d at with shot and shell,\r\nWhile horse and hero fell,\r\nThey that had fought so well\r\nCame thro\' the jaws of Death,\r\nBack from the mouth of Hell,\r\nAll that was left of them,\r\n  Left of six hundred.\r\n\r\nWhen can their glory fade?\r\nO the wild charge they made!\r\n  All the world wonder\'d.\r\nHonor the charge they made!\r\nHonor the Light Brigade,\r\n  Noble six hundred!\r\n\r\n    _Alfred, Lord Tennyson._.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSheridan\'s Ride\r\n\r\nOctober 19, 1864\r\n\r\n\r\nUp from the South at break of day,\r\nBringing to Winchester fresh dismay,\r\nThe affrighted air with a shudder bore,\r\nLike a herald in haste, to the chieftain\'s door,\r\nThe terrible grumble, and rumble, and roar,\r\nTelling the battle was on once more,\r\nAnd Sheridan--twenty miles away.\r\n\r\nAnd wider still those billows of war\r\nThundered along the horizon\'s bar;\r\nAnd louder yet into Winchester rolled\r\nThe roar of that red sea uncontrolled,\r\nMaking the blood of the listener cold\r\nAs he thought of the stake in that fiery fray,\r\nAnd Sheridan--twenty miles away.\r\n\r\nBut there is a road from Winchester town,\r\nA good broad highway leading down;\r\nAnd there, through the flush of the morning light,\r\nA steed, as black as the steeds of night,\r\nWas seen to pass, as with eagle flight;\r\nAs if he knew the terrible need,\r\nHe stretched away with the utmost speed;\r\nHills rose and fell--but his heart was gay,\r\nWith Sheridan fifteen miles away.\r\n\r\nStill sprung from those swift hoofs, thundering South,\r\nThe dust, like smoke from the cannon\'s mouth;\r\nOr the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster,\r\nForeboding to foemen the doom of disaster.\r\nThe heart of the steed and the heart of the master\r\nWere beating like prisoners assaulting their walls,\r\nImpatient to be where the battle-field calls;\r\nEvery nerve of the charger was strained to full play,\r\nWith Sheridan only ten miles away.\r\n\r\nUnder his spurning feet the road\r\nLike an arrowy Alpine river flowed,\r\nAnd the landscape sped away behind\r\nLike an ocean flying before the wind;\r\nAnd the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire,\r\nSwept on, with his wild eyes full of fire.\r\nBut lo! he is nearing his heart\'s desire--\r\nHe is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray,\r\nWith Sheridan only five miles away.\r\n\r\nThe first that the General saw were the groups\r\nOf stragglers, and then the retreating troops.\r\nWhat was done? what to do? a glance told him both,\r\nThen striking his spurs, with a terrible oath,\r\nHe dashed down the line \'mid a storm of huzzas,\r\nAnd the wave of retreat checked its course there, because\r\nThe sight of the master compelled it to pause.\r\nWith foam and with dust the black charger was gray;\r\nBy the flash of his eye and the red nostril\'s play\r\nHe seemed to the whole great army to say,\r\n"I have brought you Sheridan all the way\r\nFrom Winchester down to save the day!"\r\n\r\nHurrah, hurrah for Sheridan!\r\nHurrah, hurrah for horse and man!\r\nAnd when their statues are placed on high,\r\nUnder the dome of the Union sky--\r\nThe American soldier\'s Temple of Fame--\r\nThere, with the glorious General\'s name,\r\nBe it said in letters both bold and bright:\r\n  "Here is the steed that saved the day,\r\nBy carrying Sheridan into the fight,\r\n  From Winchester--twenty miles away!"\r\n\r\n    _Thomas Buchanan Read._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO Little Town of Bethlehem\r\n\r\n\r\nO little town of Bethlehem,\r\n  How still we see thee lie!\r\nAbove thy deep and dreamless sleep\r\n  The silent stars go by;\r\nYet in thy dark streets shineth\r\n  The everlasting Light;\r\nThe hopes and fears of all the years\r\n  Are met in thee to-night.\r\n\r\nFor Christ is born of Mary,\r\n  And, gathered all above,\r\nWhile mortals sleep, the angels keep\r\n  Their watch of wondering love.\r\nO morning stars, together\r\n  Proclaim the holy birth!\r\nAnd praises sing to God the King,\r\n  And peace to men on earth.\r\n\r\nHow silently, how silently,\r\n  The wondrous gift is given!\r\nSo God imparts to human hearts\r\n  The blessings of His heaven.\r\nNo ear may hear His coming,\r\n  But in this world of sin,\r\nWhere meek souls will receive Him still,\r\n  The dear Christ enters in.\r\n\r\nO holy Child of Bethlehem!\r\n  Descend to us, we pray;\r\nCast out our sin, and enter in,\r\n  Be born in us to-day.\r\nWe hear the Christmas angels\r\n  The great glad tidings tell;\r\nOh, come to us, abide with us,\r\n  Our Lord Emmanuel!\r\n\r\n    _Phillips Brooks._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chambered Nautilus\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,\r\n  Sails the unshadowed main,--\r\n  The venturous bark that flings\r\nOn the sweet summer wind its purpled wings\r\nIn gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,\r\n  And coral reefs lie bare,\r\nWhere the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.\r\n\r\nIts webs of living gauze no more unfurl;\r\n  Wrecked is the ship of pearl!\r\n  And every chambered cell,\r\nWhere its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,\r\nAs the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,\r\n  Before thee lies revealed,--\r\nIts irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!\r\n\r\nYear after year beheld the silent toil\r\n  That spread his lustrous coil;\r\n  Still, as the spiral grew,\r\nHe left the past year\'s dwelling for the new,\r\nStole with soft step its shining archway through,\r\n  Built up its idle door,\r\nStretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.\r\n\r\nThanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,\r\n  Child of the wandering sea,\r\n  Cast from her lap, forlorn!\r\nFrom thy dead lips a clearer note is born\r\nThan ever Triton blew from wreathed horn!\r\n  While on mine ear it rings,\r\nThrough the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:--\r\n\r\nBuild thee more stately mansions, O my soul,\r\n  As the swift seasons roll!\r\n  Leave thy low-vaulted past!\r\nLet each new temple, nobler than the last,\r\nShut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,\r\n  Till thou at length art free,\r\nLeaving thine outgrown shell by life\'s unresting sea!\r\n\r\n    _Oliver Wendell Holmes._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNobility\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue worth is in _being_, not _seeming_,--\r\n  In doing, each day that goes by,\r\nSome little good--not in dreaming\r\n  Of great things to do by and by.\r\nFor whatever men say in their blindness,\r\n  And spite of the fancies of youth,\r\nThere\'s nothing so kingly as kindness,\r\n  And nothing so royal as truth.\r\n\r\nWe get back our mete as we measure--\r\n  We cannot do wrong and feel right,\r\nNor can we give pain and gain pleasure,\r\n  For justice avenges each slight.\r\nThe air for the wing of the sparrow,\r\n  The bush for the robin and wren,\r\nBut alway the path that is narrow\r\n  And straight, for the children of men.\r\n\r\n\'Tis not in the pages of story\r\n  The heart of its ills to beguile,\r\nThough he who makes courtship to glory\r\n  Gives all that he hath for her smile.\r\nFor when from her heights he has won her,\r\n  Alas! it is only to prove\r\nThat nothing\'s so sacred as honor,\r\n  And nothing so loyal as love!\r\n\r\nWe cannot make bargains for blisses,\r\n  Nor catch them like fishes in nets;\r\nAnd sometimes the thing our life misses\r\n  Helps more than the thing which it gets.\r\nFor good lieth not in pursuing,\r\n  Nor gaining of great nor of small,\r\nBut just in the doing, and doing\r\n  As we would be done by, is all.\r\n\r\nThrough envy, through malice, through hating,\r\n  Against the world, early and late,\r\nNo jot of our courage abating--\r\n  Our part is to work and to wait.\r\nAnd slight is the sting of his trouble\r\n  Whose winnings are less than his worth;\r\nFor he who is honest is noble,\r\n  Whatever his fortunes or birth.\r\n\r\n    _Alice Cary._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wind\r\n\r\n\r\nWho has seen the wind?\r\n  Neither I nor you:\r\nBut when the leaves hang trembling,\r\n  The wind is passing through.\r\n\r\nWho has seen the wind?\r\n  Neither you nor I:\r\nBut when the trees bow down their heads,\r\n  The wind is passing by.\r\n\r\n    _Christina G.

O Pussy, my love!\r\n  What a beautiful Pussy you are,--\r\n                You are,\r\n  What a beautiful Pussy you are!"\r\n\r\nPussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl!\r\n  How wonderful sweet you sing!\r\nOh, let us be married,--too long we have tarried,--\r\n  But what shall we do for a ring?"\r\nThey sailed away for a year and a day\r\n  To the land where the Bong-tree grows,\r\nAnd there in a wood, a piggy-wig stood\r\n  With a ring in the end of his nose,--\r\n                His nose,\r\n  With a ring in the end of his nose.\r\n\r\n"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling\r\n  Your ring?" Said the Piggy, "I will."\r\nSo they took it away, and were married next day\r\n  By the turkey who lives on the hill.\r\nThey dined upon mince and slices of quince\r\n  Which they ate with a runcible spoon,\r\nAnd hand in hand on the edge of the sand\r\n  They danced by the light of the moon,--\r\n                 The moon,\r\n  They danced by the light of the moon.\r\n\r\n    _Edward Lear._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frost\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frost looked forth one still, clear night,\r\nAnd whispered, "Now I shall be out of sight;\r\nSo through the valley and over the height\r\n  In silence I\'ll take my way.\r\nI will not go on like that blustering train,\r\nThe wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,\r\nThat make so much bustle and noise in vain,\r\n  But I\'ll be as busy as they!"\r\n\r\nSo he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest;\r\nHe lit on the trees, and their boughs he drest\r\nIn diamond beads--and over the breast\r\n  Of the quivering lake he spread\r\nA coat of mail, that it need not fear\r\nThe downward point of many a spear\r\nThat he hung on its margin, far and near,\r\n  Where a rock could rear its head.\r\n\r\nHe went to the windows of those who slept,\r\nAnd over each pane like a fairy crept;\r\nWherever he breathed, wherever he stepped,\r\n  By the light of the morn were seen\r\nMost beautiful things; there were flowers and trees;\r\nThere were bevies of birds and swarms of bees;\r\nThere were cities with temples and towers; and these\r\n  All pictured in silver sheen!\r\n\r\nBut he did one thing that was hardly fair,--\r\nHe peeped in the cupboard, and finding there\r\nThat all had forgotten for him to prepare,\r\n  "Now, just to set them a-thinking,\r\nI\'ll bite this basket of fruit," said he;\r\n"This costly pitcher I\'ll burst in three;\r\nAnd the glass of water they\'ve left for me\r\n  Shall \'tchick!\' to tell them I\'m drinking!"\r\n\r\n    _Hannah F.

But Patience, to prevent\r\n  That murmur, soon replies, "God doth not need\r\nEither man\'s work or His own gifts. Who best\r\nBear His mild yoke, they serve Him best.

It is the hour of fate,\r\n  And they who follow me reach every state\r\nMortals desire, and conquer every foe\r\n  Save death; but those who doubt or hesitate,\r\nCondemned to failure, penury and woe,\r\n  Seek me in vain and uselessly implore--\r\n  I answer not, and I return no more.\r\n\r\n    _John J.

Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Brown Thrush\r\n\r\n\r\nThere\'s a merry brown thrush sitting up in the tree,\r\nHe\'s singing to me! He\'s singing to me!\r\nAnd what does he say, little girl, little boy?\r\n"Oh, the world\'s running over with joy!\r\n  Don\'t you hear? don\'t you see?\r\n  Hush! Look! In my tree,\r\nI\'m as happy as happy can be!"\r\n\r\nAnd the brown thrush keeps singing, "A nest do you see,\r\nAnd five eggs hid by me in the juniper tree?\r\nDon\'t meddle! don\'t touch! little girl, little boy,\r\nOr the world will lose some of its joy!\r\n  Now I\'m glad! now I\'m free!\r\n  And I always shall be,\r\nIf you never bring sorrow to me."\r\n\r\nSo the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree,\r\nTo you and to me, to you and to me;\r\nAnd he sings all the day, little girl, little boy,\r\n"Oh, the world\'s running over with joy;\r\n  But long it won\'t be,\r\n  Don\'t you know? don\'t you see?\r\nUnless we are as good as can be!"\r\n\r\n    _Lucy Larcom._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Quality of Mercy\r\n\r\n(_From, "The Merchant of Venice"_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quality of mercy is not strain\'d.\r\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\r\nUpon the place beneath. It is twice bless\'d:\r\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\r\n\'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\r\nThe throned monarch better than his crown.\r\nHis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\r\nThe attribute to awe and majesty,\r\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\r\nBut mercy is above this sceptred sway;\r\nIt is enthroned in the hearts of kings;\r\nIt is an attribute to God himself;\r\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest God\'s\r\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\r\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,\r\nThat, in the course of justice, none of us\r\nShould see salvation: we do pray for mercy;\r\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\r\nThe deeds of mercy.\r\n\r\n    _William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon\'t Give Up\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\'ve tried and have not won,\r\n  Never stop for crying;\r\nAll\'s that\'s great and good is done\r\n  Just by patient trying.\r\n\r\nThough young birds, in flying, fall,\r\n  Still their wings grow stronger;\r\nAnd the next time they can keep\r\n  Up a little longer.\r\n\r\nThough the sturdy oak has known\r\n  Many a blast that bowed her,\r\nShe has risen again, and grown\r\n  Loftier and prouder.\r\n\r\nIf by easy work you beat,\r\n  Who the more will prize you?\r\nGaining victory from defeat,--\r\n  That\'s the test that tries you!\r\n\r\n    _Phoebe Cary._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncident of the French Camp\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know we French stormed Ratisbon:\r\n  A mile or so away\r\nOn a little mound, Napoleon\r\n  Stood on our storming-day;\r\nWith neck out-thrust, you fancy how,\r\n  Legs wide, arms locked behind,\r\nAs if to balance the prone brow,\r\n  Oppressive with its mind.\r\nJust as perhaps he mused, "My plans\r\n  That soar, to earth may fall,\r\nLet once my army-leader Lannes\r\n  Waver at yonder wall,"--\r\nOut \'twixt the battery-smokes there flew\r\n  A rider, bound on bound\r\nFull-galloping; nor bridle drew\r\n  Until he reached the mound.\r\n\r\nThen off there flung in smiling joy,\r\n  And held himself erect\r\nBy just his horse\'s mane, a boy:\r\n  You hardly could suspect--\r\n(So tight he kept his lips compressed,\r\n  Scarce any blood came through)\r\nYou looked twice ere you saw his breast\r\n  Was all but shot in two.\r\n\r\n"Well," cried he, "Emperor, by God\'s grace\r\n  We\'ve got you Ratisbon!\r\nThe Marshall\'s in the market-place,\r\n  And you\'ll be there anon\r\nTo see your flag-bird flap his vans\r\n  Where I, to heart\'s desire,\r\nPerched him!" The chief\'s eye flashed; his plans\r\n  Soared up again like fire.\r\n\r\nThe chief\'s eye flashed; but presently\r\n  Softened itself, as sheathes\r\nA film the mother-eagle\'s eye\r\n  When her bruised eaglet breathes;\r\n"You\'re wounded!" "Nay," his soldier\'s pride\r\nTouched to the quick, he said:\r\n  "I\'m killed, Sire!" And his chief beside,\r\n  Smiling, the boy fell dead.\r\n\r\n    _Robert Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bugle Song\r\n\r\n(_From "The Princess"_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe splendor falls on castle walls\r\n    And snowy summits old in story:\r\n  The long light shakes across the lakes,\r\n    And the wild cataract leaps in glory.\r\nBlow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\r\nBlow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\r\n\r\n  O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,\r\n    And thinner, clearer, farther going!\r\n  O sweet and far from cliff and scar[A]\r\n    The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!\r\nBlow, let us hear the purple glens replying:\r\nBlow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\r\n\r\n  O love, they die in yon rich sky,\r\n    They faint on hill or field or river:\r\n  Our echoes roll from soul to soul,\r\n    And grow for ever and for ever.\r\nBlow bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\r\nAnd answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.\r\n\r\n    _Alfred, Lord Tennyson._\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Scar, a deep bank.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Child\'s Thought of God\r\n\r\n\r\nThey say that God lives very high;\r\n  But if you look above the pines\r\nYou cannot see our God; and why?\r\n\r\nAnd if you dig down in the mines,\r\n  You never see him in the gold,\r\nThough from Him all that\'s glory shines.\r\n\r\nGod is so good, He wears a fold\r\n  Of heaven and earth across His face,\r\nLike secrets kept for love untold.\r\n\r\nBut still I feel that His embrace\r\n  Slides down by thrills through all things made,\r\nThrough sight and sound of every place;\r\n\r\nAs if my tender mother laid\r\n  On my shut lips her kisses\' pressure,\r\nHalf waking me at night, and said,\r\n  "Who kissed you through the dark, dear guesser?"\r\n\r\n    _Elizabeth Barrett Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blue and The Gray\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the flow of the inland river,\r\n  Where the fleets of iron have fled,\r\nWhere the blades of grave grass quiver,\r\n  Asleep are the ranks of the dead;\r\n    Under the sod and the dew,\r\n      Waiting the judgment day--\r\n    Under the one, the Blue;\r\n      Under the other, the Gray.\r\n\r\nThese in the robings of glory,\r\n  Those in the gloom of defeat,\r\nAll, with the battle blood gory,\r\n  In the dusk of eternity meet;\r\n    Under the sod and the dew,--\r\n      Waiting the judgment day--\r\n    Under the laurel, the Blue;\r\n      Under the willow, the Gray.\r\n\r\nFrom the silence of sorrowful hours\r\n  The desolate mourners go,\r\nLovingly laden with flowers\r\n  Alike for the friend and the foe;\r\n    Under the sod and the dew,\r\n      Waiting the judgment day--\r\n    Under the roses, the Blue;\r\n      Under the lilies, the Gray.\r\n\r\nSo with an equal splendor\r\n  The morning sun-rays fall,\r\nWith a touch impartially tender,\r\n  On the blossoms blooming for all;\r\n    Under the sod and the dew,\r\n      Waiting the judgment day--\r\n    \'Broidered with gold, the Blue;\r\n      Mellowed with gold, the Gray.\r\n\r\nSo, when the summer calleth,\r\n  On forest and field of grain\r\nWith an equal murmur falleth\r\n  The cooling drip of the rain;\r\n    Under the sod and the dew,\r\n      Waiting the judgment day--\r\n    Wet with the rain, the Blue;\r\n      Wet with the rain, the Gray.\r\n\r\nSadly, but not with upbraiding,\r\n  The generous deed was done;\r\nIn the storm of the years that are fading.\r\n  No braver battle was won;\r\n    Under the sod and the dew,\r\n      Waiting the judgment day--\r\n    Under the blossoms, the Blue;\r\n      Under the garlands, the Gray.\r\n\r\nNo more shall the war-cry sever,\r\n  Or the winding rivers be red;\r\nThey banish our anger forever\r\n  When they laurel the graves of our dead!\r\n    Under the sod and the dew,\r\n      Waiting the judgment day--\r\n    Love and tears for the Blue;\r\n      Tears and love for the Gray.\r\n\r\n    _Francis Miles Finch._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood Night and Good Morning\r\n\r\n\r\nA fair little girl sat under a tree,\r\nSewing as long as her eyes could see,\r\nThen smoothed her work, and folded it right,\r\nAnd said, "Dear work, good night, good night!"\r\n\r\nSuch a number of rooks came over her head,\r\nCrying "Caw, caw," on their way to bed;\r\nShe said, as she watched their curious flight,\r\n"Little black things, good night, good night!"\r\n\r\nThe horses neighed, and the oxen lowed,\r\nThe sheep\'s "bleat, bleat" came over the road,\r\nAnd all seemed to say, with a quiet delight,\r\n"Good little girl, good night, good night!"\r\n\r\nShe did not say to the sun "Good night,"\r\nTho\' she saw him there like a ball of light;\r\nFor she knew he had God\'s own time to keep\r\nAll over the world, and never could sleep.\r\n\r\nThe tall pink foxglove bowed his head,\r\nThe violets curtseyed and went to bed;\r\nAnd good little Lucy tied up her hair,\r\nAnd said, on her knees, her favorite prayer.\r\n\r\nAnd, while on her pillow she softly lay,\r\nShe knew nothing more till again it was day;\r\nAnd all things said to the beautiful sun,\r\n"Good morning, good morning, our work is begun!"\r\n\r\n    _Lord Houghton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Moon\r\n\r\n\r\n"Lady Moon, Lady Moon, where are you roving?"\r\n    "Over the sea."\r\n"Lady Moon, Lady Moon, whom are you loving?"\r\n    "All that love me."\r\n\r\n"Are you not tired with rolling and never\r\n    Resting to sleep?\r\nWhy look so pale and so sad, as for ever\r\n    Wishing to weep?"\r\n\r\n"Ask me not this, little child, if you love me;\r\n    You are too bold\r\nI must obey my dear Father above me,\r\n    And do as I\'m told."\r\n\r\n"Lady Moon, Lady Moon, where are you roving?"\r\n    "Over the sea."\r\n"Lady Moon, Lady Moon, whom are you loving?"\r\n    "All that love me."\r\n\r\n    _Lord Houghton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBreathes There the Man With Soul So Dead?\r\n\r\n_(From "The Lay of the Last Minstrel")_\r\n\r\n\r\nBreathes there the man with soul so dead\r\nWho never to himself hath said,\r\n  This is my own, my native land?\r\nWhose heart hath ne\'er within him burned,\r\nAs home his footsteps he hath turned\r\n  From wandering on a foreign strand?\r\nIf such there breathe, go, mark him well;\r\nFor him no minstrel raptures swell;\r\nHigh though his titles, proud his name,\r\nBoundless his wealth as wish can claim,--\r\nDespite those titles, power, and pelf,\r\nThe wretch, concentred all in self,\r\nLiving, shall forfeit fair renown,\r\nAnd, doubly dying, shall go down\r\nTo the vile dust from whence he sprung,\r\nUnwept, unhonored and unsung.\r\n\r\n    _Sir Walter Scott._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPippa\'s Song\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year\'s at the spring,\r\nAnd day\'s at the morn;\r\nMorning\'s at seven;\r\nThe hillside\'s dew-pearled;\r\nThe lark\'s on the wing;\r\nThe snail\'s on the thorn;\r\nGod\'s in His heaven--\r\nAll\'s right with the world!\r\n\r\n    _Robert Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\r\n\r\n\r\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star;\r\nHow I wonder what you are!\r\nUp above the world so high,\r\nLike a diamond in the sky.\r\n\r\nWhen the glorious sun is set,\r\nWhen the grass with dew is wet,\r\nThen you show your little light,\r\nTwinkle, twinkle, all the night.\r\n\r\nIn the dark blue sky you keep,\r\nAnd often through my curtains peep;\r\nFor you never shut your eye\r\nTill the sun is in the sky.\r\n\r\nAs your bright and tiny spark\r\nLights the traveler in the dark,\r\nThough I know not what you are,\r\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star.\r\n\r\n    _Jane Taylor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrossing the Bar\r\n\r\n\r\nSunset and evening star,\r\n  And one clear call for me!\r\nAnd may there be no moaning of the bar,\r\n  When I put out to sea,\r\n\r\nBut such a tide as moving seems asleep,\r\n  Too full for sound and foam,\r\nWhen that which drew from out the boundless deep\r\n  Turns again home.\r\n\r\nTwilight and evening bell,\r\n  And after that the dark!\r\nAnd may there be no sadness of farewell,\r\n  When I embark;\r\n\r\nFor tho\' from out our bourne of Time and Place\r\n  The flood may bear me far,\r\nI hope to see my Pilot face to face\r\n  When I have crost the bar.\r\n\r\n    _Alfred, Lord Tennyson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tree\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tree\'s early leaf buds were bursting their brown;\r\n"Shall I take them away?" said the Frost, sweeping down.\r\n  "No, leave them alone\r\n  Till the blossoms have grown,"\r\nPrayed the Tree, while he trembled from rootlet to crown.\r\n\r\nThe Tree bore his blossoms, and all the birds sung:\r\n"Shall I take them away?" said the Wind, as he swung,\r\n  "No, leave them alone\r\n  Till the blossoms have grown,"\r\nSaid the Tree, while his leaflets quivering hung.\r\n\r\nThe Tree bore his fruit in the midsummer glow:\r\nSaid the child, "May I gather thy berries now?"\r\n  "Yes, all thou canst see:\r\n  Take them; all are for thee,"\r\nSaid the Tree, while he bent down his laden boughs low.\r\n\r\n    _Bjorrstjerne Bjornson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fountain\r\n\r\n\r\nInto the sunshine,\r\n  Full of the light,\r\nLeaping and flashing\r\n  From morn till night;\r\n\r\nInto the moonlight,\r\n  Whiter than snow,\r\nWaving so flower-like\r\n  When the winds blow;\r\n\r\nInto the starlight\r\n  Rushing in spray,\r\nHappy at midnight,\r\n  Happy by day;\r\n\r\nEver in motion,\r\n  Blithesome and cheery,\r\nStill climbing heavenward,\r\n  Never aweary;\r\n\r\nGlad of all weathers,\r\n  Still seeming best,\r\nUpward or downward,\r\n  Motion thy rest;\r\n\r\nFull of a nature\r\n  Nothing can tame,\r\nChanged every moment,\r\n  Ever the same;\r\n\r\nCeaseless aspiring,\r\n  Ceaseless content,\r\nDarkness or sunshine\r\n  Thy element;\r\n\r\nGlorious fountain,\r\n  Let my heart be\r\nFresh, changeful, constant,\r\n  Upward, like thee!\r\n\r\n    _James Russell Lowell._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Leak in the Dike\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good dame looked from her cottage\r\n  At the close of the pleasant day,\r\nAnd cheerily called to her little son,\r\n  Outside the door at play:\r\n"Come, Peter, come! I want you to go,\r\n  While there is light to see.\r\nTo the hut of the blind old man who lives\r\n  Across the dike, for me;\r\nAnd take these cakes I made for him--\r\n  They are hot and smoking yet;\r\nYou have time enough to go and come\r\n  Before the sun is set."\r\n\r\nThen the good-wife turned to her labor,\r\n  Humming a simple song,\r\nAnd thought of her husband, working hard\r\n  At the sluices all day long;\r\nAnd set the turf a-blazing,\r\n  And brought the coarse black bread,\r\nThat he might find a fire at night\r\n  And find the table spread.\r\n\r\nAnd Peter left the brother\r\n  With whom all day he had played,\r\nAnd the sister who had watched their sports\r\n  In the willow\'s tender shade;\r\nAnd told them they\'d see him back before\r\n  They saw a star in sight,\r\nThough he wouldn\'t be afraid to go\r\n  In the very darkest night!\r\nFor he was a brave, bright fellow,\r\n  With eye and conscience clear;\r\nHe could do whatever a boy might do,\r\n  And he had not learned to fear.\r\nWhy, he wouldn\'t have robbed a bird\'s nest,\r\n  Nor brought a stork to harm,\r\nThough never a law in Holland\r\n  Had stood to stay his arm!\r\n\r\nAnd now with his face all glowing,\r\n  And eyes as bright as the day\r\nWith the thoughts of his pleasant errand,\r\n  He trudged along the way;\r\nAnd soon his joyous prattle\r\n  Made glad a lonesome place--\r\nAlas! if only the blind old man,\r\n  Could have seen that happy face!\r\nYet he somehow caught the brightness\r\n  Which his voice and presence lent;\r\nAnd he felt the sunshine come and go\r\n  As Peter came and went.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the day was sinking,\r\n  And the winds began to rise,\r\nThe mother looked from her door again,\r\n  Shading her anxious eyes,\r\nAnd saw the shadows deepen\r\n  And birds to their homes come back,\r\nBut never a sign of Peter\r\n  Along the level track.\r\nBut she said, "He will come at morning,\r\nSo I need not fret nor grieve--\r\nThough it isn\'t like my boy at all\r\n  To stay without my leave."\r\n\r\nBut where was the child delaying?\r\n  On the homeward way was he,\r\nAcross the dike while the sun was up\r\n  An hour above the sea.\r\nHe was stopping now to gather flowers,\r\n  Now listening to the sound,\r\nAs the angry waters dashed themselves\r\n  Against their narrow bound.\r\n"Ah! well for us," said Peter,\r\n  "That the gates are good and strong,\r\nAnd my father tends them carefully,\r\n  Or they would not hold you long!\r\nYou\'re a wicked sea," said Peter,"\r\n  "I know why you fret and chafe;\r\nYou would like to spoil our lands and homes,\r\n  But our sluices keep you safe!\r\n\r\nBut hark! Through the noise of waters\r\n  Comes a low, clear, trickling sound;\r\nAnd the child\'s face pales with terror,\r\n  And his blossoms drop to the ground,\r\nHe is up the bank in a moment,\r\n  And, stealing through the sand,\r\nHe sees a stream not yet so large\r\n  As his slender, childish hand.\r\n\'Tis a leak in the dike! He is but a boy,\r\n  Unused to fearful scenes;\r\nBut, young as he is, he has learned to know\r\n  The dreadful thing that means.\r\nA leak in the dike! The stoutest heart\r\n  Grows faint that cry to hear,\r\nAnd the bravest man in all the land\r\n  Turns white with mortal fear;\r\nFor he knows the smallest leak may grow\r\n  To a flood in a single night;\r\nAnd he knows the strength of the cruel sea\r\n  When loosed in its angry might.\r\n\r\nAnd the boy! He has seen the danger\r\n  And shouting a wild alarm,\r\nHe forces back the weight of the sea\r\n  With the strength of his single arm!\r\nHe listens for the joyful sound\r\n  Of a footstep passing nigh;\r\nAnd lays his ear to the ground, to catch\r\n  The answer to his cry.\r\nAnd he hears the rough winds blowing,\r\n  And the waters rise and fall,\r\nBut never an answer comes to him\r\n  Save the echo of his call.\r\n\r\nHe sees no hope, no succor,\r\n  His feeble voice is lost;\r\nYet what shall he do but watch and wait,\r\n  Though he perish at his post!\r\nSo, faintly calling and crying\r\n  Till the sun is under the sea;\r\nCrying and moaning till the stars\r\n  Come out for company;\r\nHe thinks of his brother and sister,\r\n  Asleep in their safe warm bed;\r\nHe thinks of his father and mother,\r\n  Of himself as dying--and dead;\r\nAnd of how, when the night is over,\r\n  They must come and find him at last;\r\nBut he never thinks he can leave the place\r\n  Where duty holds him fast.\r\n\r\nThe good dame in the cottage\r\n  Is up and astir with the light,\r\nFor the thought of her little Peter\r\n  Has been with her all night.\r\nAnd now she watches the pathway,\r\n  As yester eve she had done;\r\nBut what does she see so strange and black\r\n  Against the rising sun?\r\nHer neighbors are bearing between them\r\n  Something straight to her door;\r\nHer child is coming home, but not\r\n  As he ever came before!\r\n\r\n"He is dead!" she cries, "my darling!"\r\n  And the startled father hears.\r\nAnd comes and looks the way she looks,\r\n  And fears the thing she fears;\r\nTill a glad shout from the bearers\r\n  Thrills the stricken man and wife--\r\n"Give thanks, for your son, has saved our land,\r\n  And God has saved his life!"\r\nSo, there in the morning sunshine\r\n  They knelt about the boy;\r\nAnd every head was bared and bent\r\n  In tearful, reverent joy.\r\n\r\n\'Tis many a year since then, but still,\r\n  When the sea roars like a flood,\r\nTheir boys are taught what a boy can do\r\n  Who is brave and true and good;\r\nFor every man in that country\r\n  Takes his son by the hand,\r\nAnd tells him of little Peter\r\n  Whose courage saved the land.\r\nThey have many a valiant hero\r\n  Remembered through the years;\r\nBut never one whose name so oft\r\n  Is named with loving tears;\r\nAnd his deed shall be sung by the cradle,\r\n  And told to the child on the knee,\r\nSo long as the dikes of Holland\r\n  Divide the land from the sea!\r\n\r\n    _Phoebe Cary._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert of Lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\nMerrily swinging on briar and weed,\r\n  Near to the nest of his little dame,\r\nOver the mountain-side or mead,\r\n  Robert of Lincoln is telling his name:\r\n      Bob-o\'-link, bob-o\'-link,\r\n      Spink, spank, spink;\r\nSnug and safe is that nest of ours,\r\nHidden among the summer flowers.\r\n                  Chee, chee, chee.\r\n\r\nRobert of Lincoln is gaily drest,\r\n  Wearing a bright black wedding coat;\r\nWhite are his shoulders and white his crest,\r\n  Hear him call in his merry note:\r\n      Bob-o\'-link, bob-o\'-link,\r\n      Spink, spank, spink;\r\nLook, what a nice new coat is mine,\r\nSure there was never a bird so fine.\r\n                  Chee, chee, chee.\r\n\r\nRobert of Lincoln\'s Quaker wife,\r\n  Pretty and quiet, with plain brown wings,\r\nPassing at home a patient life,\r\n  Broods in the grass while her husband sings:\r\n      Bob-o\'-link, bob-o\'-link,\r\n      Spink, spank, spink;\r\nBrood, kind creature;

Rossetti._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-day\r\n\r\n\r\nHere hath been dawning another blue day:\r\nThink, wilt thou let it slip useless away?\r\nOut of Eternity this new day was born;\r\nInto Eternity, at night, will return.\r\nBehold it aforetime no eye ever did;\r\nSo soon it forever from all eyes is hid.\r\nHere hath been dawning another blue day:\r\nThink, wilt thou let it slip useless away?\r\n\r\n    _Thomas Carlyle._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wind and the Moon\r\n\r\n\r\nSaid the Wind to the Moon, "I will blow you out.\r\n        You stare\r\n        In the air\r\n    Like a ghost in a chair,\r\nAlways looking what I am about;\r\nI hate to be watched--I will blow you out."\r\n\r\nThe Wind blew hard, and out went the Moon.\r\n        So deep,\r\n        On a heap\r\n    Of clouds, to sleep,\r\nDown lay the Wind, and slumbered soon--\r\nMuttering low, "I\'ve done for that Moon."\r\n\r\nHe turned in his bed; she was there again!\r\n        On high\r\n        In the sky\r\n    With her one clear eye,\r\nThe Moon shone white and alive and plain.\r\nSaid the Wind--"I will blow you out again."\r\n\r\nThe Wind blew hard, and the Moon grew dim.\r\n        "With my sledge\r\n        And my wedge\r\n    I have knocked off her edge!\r\nIf only I blow right fierce and grim,\r\nThe creature will soon be dimmer than dim."\r\n\r\nHe blew and blew, and she thinned to a thread.\r\n        "One puff\r\n        More\'s enough\r\n    To blow her to snuff!\r\nOne good puff more where the last was bred,\r\nAnd glimmer, glimmer, glum will go the thread!"\r\n\r\nHe blew a great blast, and the thread was gone;\r\n        In the air\r\n        Nowhere\r\n    Was a moonbeam bare;\r\nFar off and harmless the shy stars shone;\r\nSure and certain the Moon was gone.\r\n\r\nThe Wind, he took to his revels once more;\r\n        On down\r\n        In town,\r\n    Like a merry-mad clown,\r\nHe leaped and halloed with whistle and roar,\r\n"What\'s that?" The glimmering thread once more!\r\n\r\nHe flew in a rage--he danced and blew;\r\n        But in vain\r\n        Was the pain\r\n    Of his bursting brain;\r\nFor still the broader the Moon-scrap grew,\r\nThe broader he swelled his big cheeks and blew.\r\n\r\nSlowly she grew--till she filled the night,\r\n        And shone\r\n        On her throne\r\n    In the sky alone,\r\nA matchless, wonderful, silvery light,\r\nRadiant and lovely, the Queen of the Night.\r\n\r\nSaid the Wind--"What a marvel of power am I!\r\n        With my breath,\r\n        Good faith!\r\n    I blew her to death--\r\nFirst blew her away right out of the sky--\r\nThen blew her in; what a strength have I!"\r\n\r\nBut the Moon, she knew nothing about the affair,\r\n        For, high\r\n        In the sky,\r\n    With her one white eye\r\nMotionless, miles above the air,\r\nShe had never heard the great Wind blare.\r\n\r\n    _George Macdonald._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Little Plant\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the heart of a seed,\r\n  Buried deep, so deep,\r\nA dear little plant\r\n  Lay fast asleep!\r\n\r\n"Wake!" said the sunshine,\r\n  "And creep to the light!"\r\n"Wake!" said the voice\r\n  Of the raindrop bright.\r\n\r\nThe little plant heard\r\n  And it rose to see\r\nWhat the wonderful\r\n  Outside world might be.\r\n\r\n    _Kate L. Brown._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Revere\'s Ride\r\n\r\n\r\nListen, my children, and you shall hear\r\nOf the midnight ride of Paul Revere,\r\nOn the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;\r\nHardly a man is now alive\r\nWho remembers that famous day and year.\r\n\r\nHe said to his friend, "If the British march\r\n  By land or sea from the town tonight,\r\nHang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch\r\n  Of the North Church tower, as a signal light,--\r\nOne, if by land, and two, if by sea;\r\nAnd I on the opposite shore will be,\r\nReady to ride and spread the alarm\r\nThrough every Middlesex village and farm,\r\nFor the country folk to be up and to arm."\r\n\r\nThen he said, "Good-night"; and with muffled oar\r\nSilently rowed to the Charlestown shore,\r\nJust as the moon rose over the bay,\r\nWhere, swinging wide at her moorings, lay\r\nThe Somerset, British man-of-war,\r\nA phantom ship, with each mast and spar\r\nAcross the moon like a prison bar,\r\nAnd a huge black hulk, that was magnified\r\nBy its own reflection in the tide.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, his friend through alley and street\r\n  Wanders and watches with eager ears,\r\n  Till, in the silence around him, he hears\r\n    The muster of men at the barrack door,\r\nThe sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,\r\n  And the measured tread of the grenadiers\r\n    Marching down to their boats on the shore.\r\n\r\nThen he climbed to the tower of the old North Church,\r\n  By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,\r\n  To the belfry chamber overhead,\r\nAnd startled the pigeons from their perch\r\nOn the sombre rafters, that round him made\r\nMasses and moving shapes of shade;\r\nBy the trembling ladder, steep and tall,\r\nTo the highest window in the wall,\r\n  Where he paused to listen, and look down\r\n  A moment on the roofs of the town,\r\nAnd the moonlight flowing over all.\r\n\r\nBeneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead\r\n  In their night encampment on the hill,\r\n  Wrapped in silence so deep and still\r\nThat he could hear, like a sentinel\'s tread,\r\nThe watchful night wind, as it went,\r\nCreeping along from tent to tent,\r\n  And seeming to whisper, "All is well!"\r\n  A moment only he feels the spell\r\nOf the place and hour, and the secret dread\r\nOf the lonely belfry and the dead,\r\nFor suddenly all his thoughts are bent\r\nOn a shadowy something far away,\r\nWhere the river widens to meet the bay,\r\nA line of black, that bends and floats\r\nOn the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,\r\nBooted and spurred, with a heavy stride\r\n  On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.\r\nNow he patted his horse\'s side,\r\n  Now gazed on the landscape far and near,\r\nThen impetuous stamped the earth,\r\nAnd turned and tightened his saddle girth;\r\nBut mostly he watched with eager search\r\nThe belfry tower of the old North Church,\r\nAs it rose above the graves on the hill,\r\nLonely and spectral, and sombre and still.\r\nAnd lo! as he looks, on the belfry\'s height\r\nA glimmer, and then a gleam of light!\r\n  He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,\r\nBut lingers and gazes, till full on his sight\r\n  A second lamp in the belfry burns.\r\n\r\nA harry of hoofs in a village street,\r\n  A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,\r\n  And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark\r\nStruck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;\r\n  That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,\r\n  The fate of a nation was riding that night;\r\n  And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,\r\nKindled the land into flame with its heat.\r\nHe has left the village and mounted the steep,\r\nAnd beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,\r\n  Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;\r\nAnd under the alders, that skirt its edge,\r\nNow soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,\r\n  Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.\r\n\r\nIt was twelve by the village clock\r\n  When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.\r\nHe heard the crowing of the cock,\r\nAnd the barking of the farmer\'s dog,\r\nAnd felt the damp of the river fog,\r\n  That rises after the sun goes down.\r\n\r\nIt was one by the village clock\r\nWhen he galloped into Lexington,\r\nHe saw the gilded weathercock\r\nSwim in the moonlight as he passed,\r\n  And the meeting house windows, blank and bare,\r\n  Gaze at him with a spectral glare\r\nAs if they already stood aghast\r\n  At the bloody work they would look upon.\r\n\r\nIt was two by the village clock\r\n  When he came to the bridge in Concord town.\r\nHe heard the bleating of the flock,\r\nAnd the twittering of birds among the trees,\r\nAnd felt the breath of the morning breeze\r\n  Blowing over the meadows brown.\r\nAnd one was safe and asleep in his bed\r\n  Who at the bridge would be first to fall,\r\nWho that day would be lying dead,\r\n  Pierced by a British musket ball.\r\n\r\nYou know the rest. In the books you have read\r\nHow the British regulars fired and fled--\r\nHow the farmers gave them ball for ball,\r\nFrom behind each fence and farmyard wall,\r\nChasing the red coats down the lane,\r\nThen crossing the fields to emerge again\r\nUnder the trees at the turn of the road,\r\nAnd only pausing to fire and load.\r\n\r\nSo through the night rode Paul Revere;\r\n  And so through the night went his cry of alarm\r\nTo every Middlesex village and farm--\r\nA cry of defiance, and not of fear--\r\nA voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,\r\nAnd a word that shall echo forever-more;\r\nFor borne on the night wind of the past,\r\nThrough all our history to the last,\r\nIn the hour of darkness and peril and need,\r\n  The people will waken and listen to hear\r\nThe hurrying hoof beats of that steed,\r\n  And the midnight message of Paul Revere.\r\n\r\n    _Henry W. Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Flanders Fields\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Flanders fields the poppies grow\r\nBetween the crosses, row on row,\r\nThat mark our place; and in the sky\r\nThe larks, still bravely singing, fly,\r\nScarce heard amid the guns below.\r\n\r\nWe are the dead. Short days ago\r\nWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\r\nLoved and were loved; and now we lie\r\n    In Flanders fields.\r\n\r\nTake up our quarrel with the foe!\r\nTo you, from failing hands, we throw\r\nThe torch. Be yours to hold it high!\r\nIf ye break faith with us who die,\r\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies blow\r\n    In Flanders fields.\r\n\r\n_John McCrae._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Flanders Fields: An Answer\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Flanders fields the cannon boom\r\nAnd fitful flashes light the gloom,\r\nWhile up above, like eagles, fly\r\nThe fierce destroyers of the sky;\r\nWith stains the earth wherein you lie\r\nIs redder than the poppy bloom,\r\n    In Flanders fields.\r\n\r\nSleep on, ye brave. The shrieking shell,\r\nThe quaking trench, the startled yell,\r\nThe fury of the battle hell\r\nShall wake you not; for all is well.\r\nSleep peacefully; for all is well.\r\n\r\nYour flaming torch aloft we bear,\r\nWith burning heart an oath we swear\r\nTo keep the faith, to fight it through,\r\nTo crush the foe, or sleep with you\r\n    In Flanders fields.\r\n\r\n_C.B. Galbreath._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Boy Blue\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little toy dog is covered with dust,\r\n  But sturdy and stanch he stands;\r\nAnd the little toy soldier is red with rust,\r\n  And his musket moulds in his hands.\r\nTime was when the little toy dog was new\r\n  And the soldier was passing fair,\r\nAnd that was the time when our Little Boy Blue\r\n  Kissed them and put them there.\r\n\r\n"Now, don\'t you go till I come," he said,\r\n  "And don\'t you make any noise!"\r\nSo toddling off to his trundle-bed\r\n  He dreamt of the pretty toys.\r\nAnd as he was dreaming, an angel song\r\n  Awakened our Little Boy Blue,--\r\nOh, the years are many, the years are long,\r\n  But the little toy friends are true.\r\n\r\nAy, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand,\r\n  Each in the same old place,\r\nAwaiting the touch of a little hand,\r\n  The smile of a little face.\r\nAnd they wonder, as waiting these long years through,\r\n  In the dust of that little chair,\r\nWhat has become of our little Boy Blue\r\n  Since he kissed them and put them there.\r\n\r\n    _Eugene Field._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanatopsis\r\n\r\n\r\nTo him who in the love of Nature holds\r\nCommunion with her visible forms, she speaks\r\nA various language; for his gayer hours\r\nShe has a voice of gladness, and a smile\r\nAnd eloquence of beauty, and she glides\r\nInto his darker musings with a mild\r\nAnd healing sympathy, that steals away\r\nTheir sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts\r\nOf the last bitter hoar come like a blight\r\nOver thy spirit, and sad images\r\nOf the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,\r\nAnd breathless darkness, and the narrow house,\r\nMake thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;--\r\nGo forth, under the open sky, and list\r\nTo Nature\'s teachings, while from all around--\r\nEarth and her waters, and the depths of air,--\r\nComes a still voice--Yet a few days, and thee\r\nThe all-beholding sun shall see no more\r\nIn all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,\r\nWhere thy pale form was laid with many tears.\r\nNor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist\r\nThy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim\r\nThy growth, to be resolved to earth again,\r\nAnd, lost each human trace, surrendering up\r\nThine individual being, shalt thou go\r\nTo mix forever with the elements,\r\nTo be a brother to the insensible rock\r\nAnd to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain\r\nTurns with his share, and treads upon. The oak\r\nShall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.\r\nYet not to thine eternal resting-place\r\nShalt thou retire alone--nor couldst thou wish\r\nCouch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down\r\nWith patriarchs of the infant world--with kings.\r\nThe powerful of the earth--the wise, the good,\r\nFair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,\r\nAll in one mighty sepulchre. The hills,\r\nRock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun,--the vales\r\nStretching in pensive quietness between;\r\nThe venerable woods--rivers that move\r\nIn majesty, and the complaining brooks\r\nThat make the meadows green; and, poured round all,\r\nOld ocean\'s gray and melancholy waste,--\r\nAre but the solemn decorations all\r\nOf the great tomb of man. The golden sun,\r\nThe planets, all the infinite host of heaven,\r\nAre shining on the sad abodes of death,\r\nThrough the still lapse of ages. All that tread\r\nThe globe are but a handful to the tribes\r\nThat slumber in its bosom. Take the wings\r\nOf morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,\r\nOr lose thyself in the continuous woods\r\nWhere rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,\r\nSave his own dashings--yet, the dead are there;\r\nAnd millions in those solitudes, since first\r\nThe flight of years began, have laid them down\r\nIn their last sleep--the dead reign there alone.\r\nSo shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw\r\nIn silence from the living, and no friend\r\nTake note of thy departure? All that breathe\r\nWill share thy destiny. The gay will laugh\r\nWhen thou art gone, the solemn brood of care\r\nPlod on, and each one as before will chase\r\nHis favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave\r\nTheir mirth and their employments, and shall come\r\nAnd make their bed with thee. As the long train\r\nOf ages glide away, the sons of men,--\r\nThe youth in life\'s green spring, and he who goes\r\nIn the full strength of years, matron, and maid,\r\nAnd the sweet babe, and the gray-headed man,--\r\nShall one by one be gathered to thy side,\r\nBy those who in their turn shall follow them.\r\n\r\nSo live, that when thy summons comes to join\r\nThe innumerable caravan which moves\r\nTo the pale realms of shade, where each shall take\r\nHis chamber in the silent halls of death,\r\nThou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,\r\nScourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed\r\nBy an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave\r\nLike one who wraps the drapery of his couch\r\nAbout him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\r\n\r\n    _William Cullen Bryant._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Settler\'s Story\r\n\r\n\r\nIt ain\'t the funniest thing a man can do--\r\nExisting in a country when it\'s new;\r\nNature, who moved in first--a good long while--\r\nHas things already somewhat her own style,\r\nAnd she don\'t want her woodland splendors battered,\r\nHer rustic furniture broke up and scattered,\r\nHer paintings, which long years ago were done\r\nBy that old splendid artist-king, the sun,\r\nTorn down and dragged in civilization\'s gutter,\r\nOr sold to purchase settlers\' bread and butter.\r\nShe don\'t want things exposed from porch to closet,\r\nAnd so she kind o\' nags the man who does it.\r\nShe carries in her pockets bags of seeds,\r\nAs general agent of the thriftiest weeds;\r\nShe sends her blackbirds, in the early morn,\r\nTo superintend his fields of planted corn;\r\nShe gives him rain past any duck\'s desire--\r\nThen maybe several weeks of quiet fire;\r\nShe sails mosquitoes--leeches perched on wings--\r\nTo poison him with blood-devouring stings;\r\nShe loves her ague-muscle to display,\r\nAnd shake him up--say every other day;\r\nWith, thoughtful, conscientious care she makes\r\nThose travelin\' poison-bottles, rattlesnakes;\r\nShe finds time, \'mongst her other family cares,\r\nTo keep in stock good wild-cats, wolves, and bears.\r\n\r\nWell, when I first infested this retreat,\r\nThings to my view looked frightful incomplete;\r\nBut I had come with heart-thrift in my song,\r\nAnd brought my wife and plunder right along;\r\nI hadn\'t a round trip ticket to go back,\r\nAnd if I had there wasn\'t no railroad track;\r\nAnd drivin\' East was what I couldn\'t endure:\r\nI hadn\'t started on a circular tour.\r\n\r\nMy girl-wife was as brave as she was good,\r\nAnd helped me every blessed way she could;\r\nShe seemed to take to every rough old tree,\r\nAs sing\'lar as when first she took to me.\r\nShe kep\' our little log-house neat as wax,\r\nAnd once I caught her fooling with my axe.\r\nShe learned a hundred masculine things to do:\r\nShe aimed a shot-gun pretty middlin\' true,\r\nAlthough in spite of my express desire,\r\nShe always shut her eyes before she\'d fire.\r\nShe hadn\'t the muscle (though she _had_ the heart)\r\nIn out-door work to take an active part;\r\nThough in our firm of Duty and Endeavor\r\nShe wasn\'t no silent partner whatsoever.\r\nWhen I was logging, burning, choppin\' wood,\r\nShe\'d linger round and help me all she could,\r\nAnd keep me fresh-ambitious all the while,\r\nAnd lifted tons just with her voice and smile.\r\nWith no desire my glory for to rob,\r\nShe used to stan\' around and boss the job;\r\nAnd when first-class success my hands befell,\r\nWould proudly say, "_We_ did that pretty well!"\r\nShe _was_ delicious, both to hear and see--\r\nThat pretty wife-girl that kep\' house for me.\r\n\r\nWell, neighborhoods meant counties in those days;\r\nThe roads didn\'t have accommodating ways;\r\nAnd maybe weeks would pass before she\'d see--\r\nAnd much less talk with--any one but me.\r\nThe Indians sometimes showed their sun-baked faces,\r\nBut they didn\'t teem with conversational graces;\r\nSome ideas from the birds and trees she stole,\r\nBut \'twasn\'t like talking with a human soul;\r\nAnd finally I thought that I could trace\r\nA half heart-hunger peering from her face.\r\nThen she would drive it back and shut the door;\r\nOf course that only made me see it more.\r\n\'Twas hard to see her give her life to mine,\r\nMaking a steady effort not to pine;\r\n\'Twas hard to hear that laugh bloom out each minute,\r\nAnd recognize the seeds of sorrow in it.\r\nNo misery makes a close observer mourn\r\nLike hopeless grief with hopeful courage borne;\r\nThere\'s nothing sets the sympathies to paining\r\nLike a complaining woman uncomplaining.\r\nIt always draws my breath out into sighs\r\nTo see a brave look in a woman\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nWell, she went on, as plucky as could be,\r\nFighting the foe she thought I did not see,\r\nAnd using her heart-horticultural powers\r\nTo turn that forest to a bed of flowers.\r\nYou cannot check an unadmitted sigh,\r\nAnd so I had to soothe her on the sly,\r\nAnd secretly to help her draw her load;\r\nAnd soon it came to be an up-hill road.\r\nHard work bears hard upon the average pulse,\r\nEven with satisfactory results;\r\nBut when effects are scarce, the heavy strain\r\nFalls dead and solid on the heart and brain.\r\nAnd when we\'re bothered, it will oft occur\r\nWe seek blame-timber; and I lit on her;\r\nAnd looked at her with daily lessening favor,\r\nFor what I knew she couldn\'t help, to save her.\r\nAnd Discord, when he once had called and seen us,\r\nCame round quite often, and edged in between us.\r\n\r\nOne night, when I came home unusual late,\r\nToo hungry and too tired to feel first-rate,\r\nHer supper struck me wrong (though I\'ll allow\r\nShe hadn\'t much to strike with, anyhow);\r\nAnd when I went to milk the cows, and found\r\nThey\'d wandered from their usual feeding ground,\r\nAnd maybe\'d left a few long miles behind \'em,\r\nWhich I must copy, if I meant to find \'em,\r\nFlash-quick the stay-chains of my temper broke,\r\nAnd in a, trice these hot words I had spoke:\r\n"You ought to\'ve kept the animals in view,\r\nAnd drove \'em in; you\'d nothing else to do.\r\nThe heft of all our life on me must fall;\r\nYou just lie round and let me do it all."\r\n\r\nThat speech--it hadn\'t been gone a half a minute\r\nBefore I saw the cold black poison in it;\r\nAnd I\'d have given all I had, and more,\r\nTo\'ve only safely got it back in-door.\r\nI\'m now what most folks "well-to-do" would call\r\nI feel to-day as if I\'d give it all,\r\nProvided I through fifty years might reach\r\nAnd kill and bury that half-minute speech.\r\n\r\nShe handed back no words, as I could hear;\r\nShe didn\'t frown; she didn\'t shed a tear;\r\nHalf proud, half crushed, she stood and looked me o\'er,\r\nLike some one she had never seen before!\r\nBut such a sudden anguish-lit surprise\r\nI never viewed before in human eyes.\r\n(I\'ve seen it oft enough since in a dream;\r\nIt sometimes wakes me like a midnight scream.)\r\n\r\nNext morning, when, stone-faced, but heavy-hearted,\r\nWith dinner pail and sharpened axe I started\r\nAway for my day\'s work--she watched the door.\r\nAnd followed me half way to it or more;\r\nAnd I was just a-turning round at this,\r\nAnd asking for my usual good-by kiss;\r\nBut on her lip I saw a proudish curve,\r\nAnd in her eye a shadow of reserve;\r\nAnd she had shown--perhaps half unawares--\r\nSome little independent breakfast airs;\r\nAnd so the usual parting didn\'t occur,\r\nAlthough her eyes invited me to her!\r\nOr rather half invited me, for she\r\nDidn\'t advertise to furnish kisses free;\r\nYou always had--that is, I had--to pay\r\nFull market price, and go more\'n half the way.\r\nSo, with a short "Good-by," I shut the door,\r\nAnd left her as I never had before.\r\nBut when at noon my lunch I came to eat.\r\nPut up by her so delicately neat--\r\nChoicer, somewhat, than yesterday\'s had been,\r\nAnd some fresh, sweet-eyed pansies she\'d put in--\r\n"Tender and pleasant thoughts," I knew they meant--\r\nIt seemed as if her kiss with me she\'d sent;\r\nThen I became once more her humble lover,\r\nAnd said, "To-night I\'ll ask forgiveness of her."\r\n\r\nI went home over-early on that eve,\r\nHaving contrived to make myself believe,\r\nBy various signs I kind o\' knew and guessed,\r\nA thunder-storm was coming from the west.\r\n(\'Tis strange, when one sly reason fills the heart,\r\nHow many honest ones will take its part:\r\nA dozen first-class reasons said \'twas right\r\nThat I should strike home early on that night.)\r\n\r\nHalf out of breath, the cabin door I swung,\r\nWith tender heart-words trembling on my tongue;\r\nBut all within looked desolate and bare:\r\nMy house had lost its soul,--she was not there!\r\nA penciled note was on the table spread,\r\nAnd these are something like the words it said:\r\n"The cows have strayed away again, I fear;\r\nI watched them pretty close; don\'t scold me, dear.\r\nAnd where they are, I think I nearly know:\r\nI heard the bell not very long ago....\r\nI\'ve hunted for them all the afternoon;\r\nI\'ll try once more--I think I\'ll find them soon.\r\nDear, if a burden I have been to you,\r\nAnd haven\'t helped you as I ought to do.\r\nLet old-time memories my forgiveness plead;\r\nI\'ve tried to do my best--I have indeed.\r\nDarling, piece out with love the strength I lack,\r\nAnd have kind words for me when I get back."\r\n\r\nScarce did I give this letter sight and tongue--\r\nSome swift-blown rain-drops to the window clung,\r\nAnd from the clouds a rough, deep growl proceeded:\r\nMy thunder-storm had come, now \'twasn\'t needed.\r\nI rushed out-door. The air was stained with black:\r\nNight had come early, on the storm-cloud\'s back:\r\nAnd everything kept dimming to the sight,\r\nSave when the clouds threw their electric light;\r\nWhen for a flash, so clean-cut was the view,\r\nI\'d think I saw her--knowing \'twas not true.\r\nThrough my small clearing dashed wide sheets of spray,\r\nAs if the ocean waves had lost their way;\r\nScarcely a pause the thunder-battle made,\r\nIn the bold clamor of its cannonade.\r\nAnd she, while I was sheltered, dry, and warm,\r\nWas somewhere in the clutches of this storm!\r\nShe who, when storm-frights found her at her best,\r\nHad always hid her white face on my breast!\r\n\r\nMy dog, who\'d skirmished round me all the day,\r\nNow crouched and whimpering, in a corner lay;\r\nI dragged him by the collar to the wall,\r\nI pressed his quivering muzzle to a shawl--\r\n"Track her, old boy!" I shouted; and he whined,\r\nMatched eyes with me, as if to read my mind,\r\nThen with a yell went tearing through the wood,\r\nI followed him, as faithful as I could.\r\nNo pleasure-trip was that, through flood and flame;\r\nWe raced with death: we hunted noble game.\r\nAll night we dragged the woods without avail;\r\nThe ground got drenched--we could not keep the trail,\r\nThree times again my cabin home I found,\r\nHalf hoping she might be there, safe and sound;\r\nBut each time \'twas an unavailing care:\r\nMy house had lost its soul; she was not there!\r\n\r\nWhen, climbing--the wet trees, next morning-sun.\r\nLaughed at the ruin that the night had done,\r\nBleeding and drenched, by toil and sorrow bent,\r\nBack to what used to be my home I went.\r\nBut as I neared our little clearing-ground--\r\nListen!--I heard the cow-bell\'s tinkling sound.\r\nThe cabin door was just a bit ajar;\r\nIt gleamed upon my glad eyes like a star,\r\n"Brave heart," I said, "for such a fragile form!\r\nShe made them guide her homeward through the storm!"\r\nSuch pangs of joy I never felt before.\r\n"You\'ve come!" I shouted and rushed through the door.\r\n\r\nYes, she had come--and gone again. She lay\r\nWith all her young life crushed and wrenched away--\r\nLay, the heart-ruins of oar home among,\r\nNot far from where I killed her with my tongue.\r\nThe rain-drops glittered \'mid her hair\'s long strands,\r\nThe forest thorns had torn her feet and hands,\r\nAnd \'midst the tears--brave tears--that one could trace\r\nUpon the pale but sweetly resolute face,\r\nI once again the mournful words could read,\r\n"I have tried to do my best--I have, indeed."\r\n\r\nAnd now I\'m mostly done; my story\'s o\'er;\r\nPart of it never breathed the air before.\r\n\'Tisn\'t over-usual, it must be allowed,\r\nTo volunteer heart-history to a crowd,\r\nAnd scatter \'mongst them confidential tears,\r\nBut you\'ll protect an old man with his years;\r\nAnd wheresoe\'er this story\'s voice can reach,\r\nThis is the sermon I would have it preach:\r\n\r\nBoys flying kites haul in their white-winged birds:\r\nYou can\'t do that way when you\'re flying words.\r\n"Careful with fire," is good advice we know:\r\n"Careful with words," is ten times doubly so.\r\nThoughts unexpressed may sometimes fall back dead,\r\nBut God himself can\'t kill them when they\'re said!\r\nYon have my life-grief: do not think a minute\r\n\'Twas told to take up time. There\'s business in it.\r\nIt sheds advice: whoe\'er will take and live it,\r\nIs welcome to the pain it cost to give it.\r\n\r\n    _Will Carleton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeein\' Things\r\n\r\n\r\nI ain\'t afeard uv snakes, or toads, or bugs, or worms, or mice,\r\nAn\' things \'at girls are skeered uv I think are awful nice!\r\nI\'m pretty brave, I guess; an\' yet I hate to go to bed,\r\nFor, when I\'m tucked up warm an\' snug an\' when my prayers are said,\r\nMother tells me "Happy dreams!" and takes away the light,\r\nAn\' leaves me lying all alone an\' seein\' things at night!\r\n\r\nSometimes they\'re in the corner, sometimes they\'re by the door,\r\nSometimes they\'re all a-standin\' in the middle uv the floor;\r\nSometimes they are a-sittin\' down, sometimes they\'re walkin\' round\r\nSo softly an\' so creepylike they never make a sound!\r\nSometimes they are as black as ink, an\' other times they\'re white--\r\nBut the color ain\'t no difference when you see things at night!\r\n\r\nOnce, when I licked a feller \'at had just moved on our street,\r\nAn\' father sent me up to bed without a bite to eat,\r\nI woke up in the dark an\' saw things standin\' in a row,\r\nA-lookin\' at me cross-eyed an\' p\'intin\' at me--so!\r\nOh, my! I was so skeered that time I never slep\' a mite--\r\nIt\'s almost alluz when I\'m bad I see things at night!\r\n\r\nLucky thing I ain\'t a girl, or I\'d be skeered to death!\r\nBein\' I\'m a boy, I duck my head an\' hold my breath;\r\nAn\' I am, oh! so sorry I\'m a naughty boy, an\' then\r\nI promise to be better an\' I say my prayers again!\r\nGran\'ma tells me that\'s the only way to make it right\r\nWhen a feller has been wicked an\' sees things at night!\r\n\r\nAn\' so, when other naughty boys would coax me into sin,\r\nI try to skwush the Tempter\'s voice \'at urges me within;\r\nAn\' when they\'s pie for supper, or cakes \'at\'s big an\' nice,\r\nI want to--but I do not pass my plate f\'r them things twice!\r\nNo, ruther let Starvation wipe me slowly out o\' sight\r\nThan I should keep a-livin\' on an\' seein\' things at night!\r\n\r\n    _Eugene Field._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Raggedy Man\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, The Raggedy Man!

Whittier._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSister and I\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were hunting for wintergreen berries,\r\n  One May-day, long gone by,\r\nOut on the rocky cliff\'s edge,\r\n  Little sister and I.\r\nSister had hair like the sunbeams;\r\n  Black as a crow\'s wing, mine;\r\nSister had blue, dove\'s eyes;\r\n  Wicked, black eyes are mine.\r\nWhy, see how my eyes are faded--\r\n  And my hair, it is white as snow!\r\nAnd thin, too! don\'t you see it is?\r\n  I tear it sometimes; so!\r\nThere, don\'t hold my hands, Maggie,\r\n  I don\'t feel like tearing it now;\r\nBut--where was I in my story?\r\n  Oh, I was telling you how\r\nWe were looking for wintergreen berries;\r\n  \'Twas one bright morning in May,\r\nAnd the moss-grown rocks were slippery\r\n  With the rains of yesterday.\r\nBut I was cross that morning,\r\n  Though the sun shone ever so bright--\r\nAnd when sister found the most berries,\r\n  I was angry enough to fight!\r\nAnd when she laughed at my pouting--\r\n  We were little things, you know--\r\nI clinched my little fist up tight,\r\n  And struck her the biggest blow!\r\nI struck her--I tell you--I struck her,\r\n  And she fell right over below--\r\nThere, there, Maggie, I won\'t rave now;\r\n  You needn\'t hold me so--\r\nShe went right over, I tell you,\r\n  Down, down to the depths below!\r\n\'Tis deep and dark and horrid\r\n  There where the waters flow!\r\nShe fell right over, moaning,\r\n  "Bessie, oh, Bessie!" so sad,\r\nThat, when I looked down affrighted,\r\n  It drove me _mad--mad_!\r\nOnly her golden hair streaming\r\n  Out on the rippling wave,\r\nOnly her little hand reaching\r\n  Up, for someone to save;\r\nAnd she sank down in the darkness,\r\n  I never saw her again,\r\nAnd this is a chaos of blackness\r\n  And darkness and grief since then.\r\nNo more playing together\r\n  Down on the pebbly strand;\r\nNor building our dolls stone castles\r\n  With halls and parlors grand;\r\nNo more fishing with bent pins,\r\n  In the little brook\'s clear waves;\r\nNo more holding funerals\r\n  O\'er dead canaries\' graves;\r\nNo more walking together\r\n  To the log schoolhouse each morn;\r\nNo more vexing the master\r\n  With putting his rules to scorn;\r\nNo more feeding of white lambs\r\n  With milk from the foaming pail;\r\nNo more playing "see-saw"\r\n  Over the fence of rail;\r\nNo more telling of stories\r\n  After we\'ve gone to bed;\r\nNor talking of ghosts and goblins\r\n  Till we fairly shiver with dread;\r\nNo more whispering fearfully\r\n  And hugging each other tight,\r\nWhen the shutters shake and the dogs howl\r\n  In the middle of the night;\r\nNo more saying "Our Father,"\r\n  Kneeling by mother\'s knee--\r\nFor, Maggie, I _struck_ sister!\r\n  And mother is dead, you see.\r\nMaggie, sister\'s an angel,\r\n  Isn\'t she? Isn\'t it true?\r\nFor angels have golden tresses\r\n  And eyes like sister\'s, blue?\r\nNow _my_ hair isn\'t golden,\r\n  My eyes aren\'t blue, you see--\r\nNow tell me, Maggie, if I were to die,\r\n  Could they make an angel of me?\r\nYou say, "Oh, yes"; you think so?\r\n  Well, then, when I come to die,\r\nWe\'ll play up there, in God\'s garden--\r\n  We\'ll play there, sister and I.\r\nNow, Maggie, you needn\'t eye me\r\n  Because I\'m talking so queer;\r\nBecause I\'m talking so strangely;\r\n  You needn\'t have the least fear,\r\nSomehow I\'m feeling to-night, Maggie,\r\n  As I never felt before--\r\nI\'m sure, I\'m sure of it, Maggie,\r\n  I never shall rave any more.\r\nMaggie, you know how these long years\r\n  I\'ve heard her calling, so sad,\r\n"Bessie, oh, Bessie!" so mournful?\r\n  It always drives me _mad_!\r\nHow the winter wind shrieks down the chimney,\r\n  "Bessie, oh, Bessie!" oh! oh!\r\nHow the south wind wails at the casement,\r\n  "Bessie, oh, Bessie!" so low,\r\nBut most of all when the May-days\r\n  Come back, with the flowers and the sun,\r\nHow the night-bird, singing, all lonely,\r\n  "Bessie, oh, Bessie!" doth moan;\r\nYou know how it sets me raving--\r\n  For _she_ moaned, "_Oh, Bessie!_" just so,\r\nThat time I _struck_ little sister,\r\n  On the May-day long ago!\r\nNow, Maggie, I\'ve something to tell you--\r\n  You know May-day is here--\r\nWell, this very morning, at sunrise,\r\n  The robins chirped "Bessie!" so clear--\r\nAll day long the wee birds singing,\r\n  Perched on the garden wall,\r\nCalled "Bessie, oh, Bessie!" so sweetly,\r\n  I couldn\'t feel sorry at all.\r\nNow, Maggie, I\'ve something to tell you--\r\n  Let me lean up to you close--\r\nDo you see how the sunset has flooded\r\n  The heavens with yellow and rose?\r\nDo you see o\'er the gilded cloud mountains\r\n  Sister\'s golden hair streaming out?\r\nDo you see her little hand beckoning?\r\n  Do you hear her little voice calling out\r\n"Bessie, oh, Bessie!" so gladly,\r\n  "Bessie, oh, Bessie! Come, haste"?\r\nYes, sister, I\'m coming; I\'m coming,\r\n  To play in God\'s garden at last!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Poems Teachers Ask For, by Various\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 18909.txt or 18909.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/9/0/18909/\r\n\r\nProduced by Charles Aldarondo and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
