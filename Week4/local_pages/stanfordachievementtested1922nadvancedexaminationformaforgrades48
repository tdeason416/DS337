The robin lays four or five blue eggs. The dove lays two\r\n   white eggs. The sparrow lays six or eight speckled eggs. If we should\r\n   find a nest with four blue eggs in it, we could be pretty sure that it\r\n   was the nest of a............. rather than of a............. or dove.\r\n\r\n 9 Once there lived on a mountain near a village an immense giant whose\r\n   cruelty kept the people of the village in great terror.

One person called Jack\r\n   must climb a tree and hang by his arms from a low bough.

If\r\n   Jack can see or guess who did it, he may drop down, and the guilty\r\n   person takes his place. Otherwise he has to............. there for\r\n   another turn and sing out, "Alas, alack, another whack."

Often it\r\n   saves one from disappointment or failure. Occasionally, however, one\r\n   finds a person so extremely.................. that his will is\r\n   paralyzed and he is totally unable to set about any new undertaking.\r\n   Too much.................. is indeed often.................. than too\r\n   little.\r\n\r\n23 A whale is not a fish, even though it does live in water. A fish has no\r\n   lungs, is cold-blooded, and absorbs oxygen from the water through its\r\n   gills; but a whale is warm-blooded and has a genuine set of lungs. In\r\n   consequence, in bodily structure the is.................. like a\r\n   shark, which is a true fish, than it is like a horse.\r\n\r\n24 The brook on our farm has many whims. It ripples over bright and shiny\r\n   rocks, and falls into a placid little pool so clear that I can see the\r\n   pebbles on the bottom and can see myself down there, too.

The ambitious person may\r\n   think that he merely thirsts to "do something" or "be somebody" but\r\n   really what he craves is to figure potently in the minds of others, to\r\n   be greatly loved, admired, or feared. To reap a success which no one\r\n   .................. does not satisfy the yearnings of the\r\n   .................. individual.\r\n\r\n26 Washington was a very silent man. Of no man in the world\'s history do\r\n   we have so few sayings of a personal kind. As for talking about\r\n   himself, that was something in which he almost never indulged. Yet it\r\n   would be a great error to interpret his.................. as an\r\n   indication that he was in any sense cold or unfeeling.\r\n\r\n27 As a rule, it is more economical to remember things by associating them\r\n   clearly and vigorously than by going through many repetitions of them.\r\n   Thus, a clear understanding of the causes for the Democratic victory in\r\n   the national election in 1916 will be.................. effective in\r\n   remembering the fact than a dozen.................. of the statement\r\n   "Woodrow Wilson was elected in 1916."\r\n\r\n28 Fundamentally, education depends upon the capacity of a person to\r\n   profit by past experiences. Past situations modify present and future\r\n   adjustments. Education in its broadest sense means acquiring\r\n   experiences that serve to.................. existing inherited or\r\n   acquired tendencies of behavior.\r\n\r\n29 "Na\xc3\xafve" and "unsophisticated" are frequently confused. The former\r\n   suggests a type of behavior which is artless, spontaneous, and free\r\n   from the restraints of custom. The latter implies fully as great lack\r\n   of knowledge of social usage, and, in addition, conduct which is\r\n   primitive and perchance inelegant. Thus, the.................. youth\r\n   was the first to enter the car, and his.................. little\r\n   sister warmly kissed him in the presence of the king. We may also say\r\n   that a country boy is.................. with respect to city life and\r\n   customs.\r\n\r\n                     _Test 1.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
