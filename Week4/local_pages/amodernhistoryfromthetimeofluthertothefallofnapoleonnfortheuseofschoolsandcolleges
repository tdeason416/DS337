I have simply attempted to condense the great and varied\r\nsubjects which are presented, so as to furnish a connected narrative\r\nof what is most vital in the history of the last three hundred years,\r\navoiding both minute details and elaborate disquisitions. It has been\r\nmy aim to write a book, which should be neither a chronological table\r\nnor a philosophical treatise, but a work adapted to the wants of young\r\npeople in the various stages of education, and which, it is hoped,\r\nwill also prove interesting to those of maturer age; who have not the\r\nleisure to read extensive works, and yet who wish to understand the\r\nconnection of great events since the Protestant Reformation. Those\r\ncharacters, institutions, reforms, and agitations, which have had the\r\ngreatest influence in advancing society, only have been described, and\r\nthese not to the extent which will satisfy the learned or the curious.\r\nDates and names, battles and sieges, have not been disregarded; but\r\nmore attention has been given to those ideas and to those men by whose\r\ninfluence and agency great changes have taken place. In a work so\r\nlimited, and yet so varied, marginal references to original\r\nauthorities have not been deemed necessary; but a list of standard and\r\naccessible authors is furnished, at the close of each chapter, which\r\nthe young student, seeking more minute information, can easily\r\nconsult. A continuation of this History to the present time might seem\r\ndesirable; but it would be difficult to condense the complicated\r\nevents of the last thirty years into less than another volume. Instead\r\nof an unsatisfactory compend, especially of subjects concerning which\r\nthere are great differences of opinion, and considerable warmth of\r\nfeeling, useful tables of important events are furnished in the\r\nAppendix. I have only to add, that if I have succeeded in remedying,\r\nin some measure, the defects of those dry compendiums, which are used\r\nfor want of living histories; if I have combined what is instructive\r\nwith what is entertaining; and especially if I shall impress the\r\ncommon mind, even to a feeble degree, with those great moral truths\r\nwhich history ought to teach, I shall feel that my agreeable labor is\r\nnot without its reward.\r\n\r\n                                        J.

It was a period very fruitful in great men\r\nand great events, and, though stormy and turbulent, was favorable to\r\nexperiments and reforms. The nations of Europe seem to have been\r\nsuddenly aroused from a state of torpor and rest, and to have put\r\nforth new energies in every department of life. The material and the\r\npolitical, the moral and the social condition of society was subject\r\nto powerful agitations, and passed through important changes.\r\n\r\nGreat _discoveries and inventions_ had been made. The use of movable\r\ntypes, first ascribed to a German, of Mentz, by the name of Gutenberg,\r\nin 1441, and to Peter Schoeffer, in 1444, changed the whole system of\r\nbook-making, and vastly increased the circulation of the Scriptures,\r\nthe Greek and Latin classics, and all other valuable works, which, by\r\nthe industry of the monkish copyist, had been preserved from the\r\nravages of time and barbarism. Gunpowder, whose explosive power had\r\nbeen perceived by Roger Bacon as early as 1280, though it was not used\r\non the field of battle until 1346, had completely changed the art of\r\nwar and had greatly contributed to undermine the feudal system. The\r\npolarity of the magnet, also discovered in the middle ages, and not\r\npractically applied to the mariner\'s compass until 1403, had led to\r\nthe greatest event of the fifteenth century--the discovery of America\r\nby Christopher Columbus, in 1492. The impulse given to commerce by\r\nthis and other discoveries of unknown continents and oceans, by the\r\nPortuguese, the Spaniards, the Dutch, the English, and the French,\r\ncannot be here enlarged on. America revealed to the astonished\r\nEuropean her riches in gold and silver; and Indian spices, and silks,\r\nand drugs, were imported, through new channels, into all the countries\r\ninhabited by the Teutonic races. Mercantile wealth, with all its\r\nrefinements, acquired new importance in the eyes of the nations. The\r\nworld opened towards the east and the west. The horizon of knowledge\r\nextended. Popular delusions were dispelled. Liberality of mind was\r\nacquired. The material prosperity of the western nations was\r\nincreased. Tastes became more refined, and social intercourse more\r\ncheerful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revival of the Arts.]\r\n\r\nArt, in all its departments, was every where revived at this epoch.\r\nHouses became more comfortable, and churches more splendid. The\r\nutensils of husbandry and of cookery were improved. Linen and woollen\r\nmanufactures supplanted the coarser fabrics of the dark ages. Music\r\nbecame more elaborate, and the present system of notation was adopted.\r\nThe genius of the sculptor again gave life and beauty to a marble\r\nblock, and painting was carried to greater perfection than by the\r\nancient Greeks and Romans. Florence, Venice, Milan, and Rome became\r\nseats of various schools of this beautiful art, of which Michael\r\nAngelo, Correggio, the Carracci, and Raphael were the most celebrated\r\nmasters, all of whom were distinguished for peculiar excellences,\r\nnever since surpassed, or even equalled. The Flemish artists were\r\nscarcely behind the Italian; and Rubens, of Antwerp, may well rank\r\nwith Correggio and Titian. To Raphael, however, the world has, as yet,\r\nfurnished no parallel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of Feudalism.]\r\n\r\n_The political and social structure_ of society changed. The crusades,\r\nlong before, had given a shock to the political importance of the\r\nfeudal aristocracy, and reviving commerce and art had shaken the\r\nsystem to its foundations. The Flemish weavers had arisen, and a\r\nmercantile class had clamored for new privileges. In the struggle of\r\nclasses, and in the misfortunes of nobles, monarchs had perceived the\r\nadvantages they might gain, and fortunate circumstances enabled them\r\nto raise absolute thrones, and restore a central power, always so\r\nnecessary to the cause of civilization. Feudalism had answered many\r\nuseful ends in the dark ages. It had secured a reciprocity of duties\r\nbetween a lord and his vassal; it had restored loyalty, truth, and\r\nfidelity among semi-barbarians; it had favored the cultivation of the\r\nsoil; it had raised up a hardy rural population; it had promoted\r\nchivalry, and had introduced into Europe the modern gentleman; it had\r\nennobled friendship, and spread the graces of urbanity and gentleness\r\namong rough and turbulent warriors. But it had, also, like all human\r\ninstitutions, become corrupt, and failed to answer the ends for which\r\nit was instituted. It had become an oppressive social despotism; it\r\nhad widened the distinction between the noble and ignoble classes; it\r\nhad produced selfishness and arrogance among the nobles, and a mean\r\nand cringing sycophancy among the people; it had perpetuated\r\nprivileges, among the aristocracy, exceedingly unjust, and ruinous to\r\nthe general welfare of society. It therefore fell before the advancing\r\nspirit of the age, and monarchies and republics were erected on its\r\nruins. The people, as well as monarchs, had learned the secret of\r\ntheir power. They learned that, by combining their power, they could\r\nsuccessfully resist their enemies. The principle of association was\r\nlearned. Combinations of masses took place. Free cities were\r\nmultiplied. A population of artificers, and small merchants, and free\r\nfarmers arose. They discussed their privileges, and asserted their\r\nindependence. Political liberty was born, and its invaluable blessings\r\nwere conceived, if they were not realized.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of Scholasticism.]\r\n\r\n_And the intellectual state_ of Europe received an impulse as marked\r\nand beneficent as the physical and social. The scholastic philosophy,\r\nwith its dry and technical logic, its abstruse formulas, and its\r\nsubtle refinements, ceased to satisfy the wants of the human mind, now\r\ncraving light and absolute knowledge in all departments of science and\r\nphilosophy. Like feudalism, it had once been useful; but like that\r\ninstitution, it had also become corrupted, and an object of sarcasm\r\nand mockery. It had trained the European mind for the discoveries of\r\nthe sixteenth century; it had raised up an inquisitive spirit, and had\r\nled to profound reflections on the existence of God, on his attributes\r\nand will, on the nature of the soul, on the faculties of the mind and\r\non the practical duties of life. But this philosophy became pedantic\r\nand cold; covered, as with a funereal shade, the higher pursuits of\r\nlife; and diverted attention from what was practical and useful. That\r\nearnest spirit, which raised up Luther and Bacon, demanded, of the\r\ngreat masters of thought, something which the people could understand,\r\nand something which would do them good.\r\n\r\nIn poetry, the insipid and immoral songs of the Proven\xc3\xa7al bards gave\r\nplace to the immortal productions of the great creators of the\r\nEuropean languages. Dante led the way in Italy, and gave to the world\r\nthe "Divine Comedy"--a masterpiece of human genius, which raised him\r\nto the rank of Homer and Virgil. Petrarch followed in his steps, and,\r\nif not as profound or original as Dante, yet is unequalled as an\r\n"enthusiastic songster of ideal love." He also gave a great impulse to\r\ncivilization by his labors in collecting and collating manuscripts.\r\nBoccaccio also lent his aid in the revival of literature, and wrote a\r\nseries of witty, though objectionable stories, from which the English\r\nChaucer borrowed the notion of his "Canterbury Tales." Chaucer is the\r\nfather of English poetry, and kindled a love of literature among his\r\nisolated countrymen; and was one of the few men who, in the evening of\r\nhis days, looked upon the world without austerity, and expressed\r\nhimself with all the vivacity of youthful feeling.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ecclesiastical Corruptions.]\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the leading events and circumstances which gave a\r\nnew life to European society, and created a desire for better days.\r\nAll of these causes of improvement acted and reacted on each other in\r\nvarious ways, and prepared the way to new and great developments of\r\naction and passion. These new energies were, however, unfortunately\r\nchecked by a combination of evils which had arisen in the dark ages,\r\nand which required to be subverted before any great progress could be\r\nreasonably expected. These evils were most remarkable in the church\r\nitself and almost extinguished the light which Christ and his apostles\r\nhad kindled. The church looked with an evil eye on many of the\r\ngreatest improvements and agitations of the age, and attempted to\r\nsuppress the spirit of insurrection which had arisen against the\r\nabuses and follies of past ages. Great ideas were ridiculed, and\r\ndaring spirits were crushed. There were many good men in the church\r\nwho saw and who lamented prevailing corruptions, but their voice was\r\noverwhelmed by the clamors of interested partisans, or silenced by the\r\nauthority of the popes. The character of the popes themselves was not\r\nwhat was expected of the heads of the visible church, or what was\r\nfrequently exhibited in those ignorant and superstitious times, when\r\nthe papacy fulfilled, in the opinion of many enlightened Protestants,\r\na benevolent mission. None had the disinterestedness of Gregory\xc2\xa0I., or\r\nthe talents of Gregory\xc2\xa0VII. There had been a time when the great\r\ncentral spiritual monarchy of Rome had been exercised for the peace\r\nand tranquillity of Europe, when it was uniformly opposed to slavery\r\nand war, and when it was a mild and paternal government, which\r\nprotected innocence and weakness, while it punished injustice and\r\ncrime. The time was, when popes had been elevated for their piety and\r\nlearning, and when they lived as saints and died as martyrs. But that\r\ntime had passed. The Roman church did not keep up with the spirit or\r\nthe wants of the age, and moreover did not reform itself from vices\r\nwhich had been overlooked in ages of ignorance and superstition. In\r\nthe fifteenth century, many great abuses scandalized a body of men who\r\nshould have been the lights of the world; and the sacred pontiffs\r\nthemselves set examples of unusual depravity. Julius\xc2\xa0II. marched at\r\nthe head of armies. Alexander\xc2\xa0VI. secured his election by bribery, and\r\nreigned by extortion. He poisoned his own cardinals, and bestowed on\r\nhis son C\xc3\xa6sar Borgia--an incarnated demon--the highest dignities and\r\nrewards. It was common for the popes to sell the highest offices in\r\nthe church for money, to place boys on episcopal thrones, to absolve\r\nthe most heinous and scandalous crimes for gold, to encourage the\r\nmassacre of heretics, and to disgrace themselves by infamous vices.\r\nAnd a general laxity of morals existed among all orders of the clergy.\r\nThey were ignorant, debauched, and ambitious. The monks were\r\nexceedingly numerous; had ceased to be men of prayer and\r\ncontemplation, as in the days of Benedict and Bernard; and might be\r\nseen frequenting places of demoralizing excitement, devoted to\r\npleasure, and enriched by inglorious gains.\r\n\r\nBut the evils which the church encouraged were more dangerous than the\r\nvices of its members. These evils were inherent in the papal system,\r\nand were hard to be subverted. There were corruptions of doctrine, and\r\ncorruptions in the government and customs of the church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Papal Infallibility.]\r\n\r\nThere generally prevailed, throughout Christendom, the belief in papal\r\ninfallibility, which notion subverted the doctrines of the Bible, and\r\nplaced its truths, at least, on a level with the authority of the\r\nschoolmen. It favored the various usurpations of the popes, and\r\nstrengthened the bonds of spiritual despotism.\r\n\r\nThe popes also claimed a control over secular princes, as well as the\r\nsupremacy of the church. Hildebrand was content with riveting the\r\nchains of universal spiritual authority, the evil and absurdity of\r\nwhich cannot well be exaggerated; but his more ambitious successors\r\nsought to reduce the kings of the earth to perfect vassalage, and,\r\nwhen in danger of having their monstrous usurpations torn from them,\r\nwere ready to fill the world with discord and war.\r\n\r\nBut the worldly popes of the fifteenth century also aspired to be\r\ntemporal princes. They established the most elegant court in Europe;\r\nthey supported large armies; they sought to restore the splendor of\r\nimperial Rome; they became ambitious of founding great families; they\r\nenriched their nephews and relations at the sacrifice of the best\r\ninterests of their church; they affected great state and dignity; they\r\nbuilt gorgeous palaces; they ornamented their capital with pictures\r\nand statues.\r\n\r\nThe territories of Rome were, however, small. The lawful revenues of\r\nthe popes were insufficient to gratify their extravagance and pomp.\r\nBut money, nevertheless, they must have. In order to raise it, they\r\nresorted to extortion and corruption. They imposed taxes on\r\nChristendom, direct and indirect. These were felt as an intolerable\r\nburden; but such was the superstition of the times, that they were\r\nsuccessfully raised. But even these were insufficient to gratify papal\r\navarice and rapacity. They then resorted, in their necessities, to the\r\nmeanest acts, imposed on the simplicity of their subjects, and finally\r\nadopted the most infamous custom which ever disgraced the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sale of Indulgences.]\r\n\r\nThey pardoned sins for money--granted sales of indulgences for crime.\r\nA regular scale for absolution was graded. A proclamation was made\r\nevery fifty, and finally every twenty-five years, of a year of\r\njubilee, when plenary remission of all sin was promised to those who\r\nshould make a pilgrimage to Rome. And so great was the influx of\r\nstrangers, and consequently of wealth, to Rome, that, on one occasion,\r\nit was collected into piles by rakes. It is computed that two hundred\r\nthousand deluded persons visited the city in a single month. But the\r\nvast sums they brought to Rome, and the still greater sums which were\r\nobtained by the sale of indulgences, and by various taxations, were\r\nall squandered in ornamenting the city, and in supporting a luxurious\r\ncourt, profligate cardinals, and superfluous ministers of a corrupted\r\nreligion. Then was erected the splendid church of St. Peter, more\r\nafter the style of Grecian temples, than after the model of the Gothic\r\ncathedrals of York and Cologne. Glorious was that monument of reviving\r\nart; wonderful was its lofty dome; but the vast sums required to build\r\nit opened the eyes of Christendom to the extravagance and presumption\r\nof the popes; and this splendid trophy of their glory also became the\r\nemblem of their broken power. Their palaces and temples made an\r\nimposing show, but detracted from their real strength, which consisted\r\nin the affections of their spiritual subjects. Their outward grandeur,\r\nlike the mechanical agencies which kings employ, was but a poor\r\nsubstitute for the invisible power of love,--in all ages, and among\r\nall people, "that cheap defence" which supports thrones and kingdoms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Corruptions of the Church.]\r\n\r\nAnother great evil was, the prevalence of an idolatrous spirit. In the\r\nchurches and chapels, and even in private families, were innumerable\r\nimages of saints, pictures of the Virgin, relics, crucifixes, &c.,\r\ndesigned at first to kindle a spirit of devotion among the rude and\r\nuneducated, but gradually becoming objects of real adoration.\r\nIntercessions were supposed to be made by the Virgin Mary, and by\r\nfavorite saints, more efficacious with Deity than the penitence and\r\nprayers of the erring and sinful themselves. The influence of this\r\nveneration for martyrs and saints was degrading to the mind, and\r\nbecame a very lucrative source of profit to the priests, who peddled\r\nthe bones and relics of saints as they did indulgences, and who\r\ninvented innumerable lies to attest the genuineness and antiquity of\r\nthe objects they sold, all of which were parts of the great system of\r\nfraud and avarice which the church permitted.\r\n\r\nAgain; the public worship of God was in a language the people could\r\nnot understand, but rendered impressive by the gorgeous dresses of the\r\npriests, and the magnificence of the altar, and the images and vessels\r\nof silver and gold, reflecting their splendor, by the light of wax\r\ncandles, on the sombre pillars, roofs, and windows of the Gothic\r\nchurch, and the effect heightened by exciting music, and other appeals\r\nto the taste or imagination, rather than to the reason and the heart.\r\nThe sermons of the clergy were frivolous, and ill adapted to the\r\nspiritual wants of the people. "Men went to the Vatican," says the\r\nlearned and philosophical Ranke, "not to pray, but to contemplate the\r\nBelvidere Apollo. They disgraced the most solemn festivals by open\r\nprofanations. The clergy, in their services, sought the means of\r\nexciting laughter. One would mock the cuckoo, and another recite\r\nindecent stories about St. Peter." Luther, when he visited Italy, was\r\nextremely shocked at the infidel spirit which prevailed among the\r\nclergy, who were hostile to the circulation of the Scriptures, and who\r\nencouraged persecutions and inquisitions. This was the age when the\r\ndreadful tribunal of the Inquisition flourished, although its chief\r\nenormities were perpetrated in Spain and Portugal. It never had an\r\nexistence in England, and but little influence in France and Germany.\r\nBut if the Church did not resort, in all countries, to that dread\r\ntribunal which subjected youth, beauty, and innocence to the\r\ninquisitorial vengeance of narrow-minded Dominican monks, still she\r\nwas hostile to free inquiry, and to all efforts made to emancipate the\r\nreason of men.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of religious persecution, which inflamed the Roman Church\r\nto punish all dissenters from the doctrine and abuses she promulgated,\r\ncan never be questioned. The Waldenses and Albigenses had suffered, in\r\ndarker times, almost incredible hardships and miseries--had been\r\nalmost annihilated by the dreadful crusade which was carried on\r\nagainst them, so that two hundred thousand had perished for supposed\r\nheresy. But reference is not now made to this wholesale massacre, but\r\nto those instances of individual persecution which showed the extreme\r\njealousy and hatred of Rome of all new opinions. John Huss and Jerome\r\nof Prague were publicly burned for attempting to reform the church,\r\nand even Savonarola, who did not deny the authority of the popes, was\r\ncondemned to the flames for denouncing the vices of his age, rather\r\nthan the evils of the church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Necessity for Reform.]\r\n\r\nThese multiplied evils, which checked the spirit of improvement,\r\ncalled loudly for reform. Councils were assembled for the purpose; but\r\ncouncils supported, rather than diminished, the evils of which even\r\nprinces complained. The reform was not destined to come from\r\ndignitaries in the church or state; not from bishops, nor\r\nphilosophers, nor kings, but from an obscure teacher of divinity in a\r\nGerman university, whom the genius of a reviving and awakened age had\r\nsummoned into the field of revolutionary warfare. It was reserved for\r\nMartin Luther to commence the first successful rebellion against the\r\ndespotism of Rome, and to give the greatest impulse to freedom of\r\nthought, and a general spirit of reform, which ten centuries had seen.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent event in modern times is unquestionably the\r\nProtestant Reformation, and it was by far the most momentous in its\r\nresults. It gave rise, directly or indirectly, to the great wars of\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as well as to those rival\r\nsects which agitated the theological world. It is connected with the\r\nenterprises of great monarchs, with the struggle of the Huguenots and\r\nPuritans, with the diffusion of knowledge, and with the progress of\r\ncivil and religious liberty in Europe. An event, therefore, of such\r\ninterest and magnitude, may well be adopted as a starting point in\r\nmodern history, and will, accordingly, be the first subject of\r\nespecial notice. History is ever most impressive and philosophical\r\nwhen great changes and revolutions are traced to the agency of great\r\nspiritual ideas. Moreover, modern history is so complicated, that it\r\nis difficult to unravel it except by tracing the agency of great\r\ncauses, rather than by detailing the fortunes of kings and nobles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\xc2\xa0II.\r\n\r\nMARTIN LUTHER AND HIS ASSOCIATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Early Life of Luther.]\r\n\r\nMartin Luther was born the 10th of November, 1483, at Eisleben, in\r\nSaxony. His father was a miner, of Mansfield, and his ancestors were\r\npeasants, who lived near the summit of the Thuringian Forest. His\r\nearly years were spent at Mansfield, in extreme poverty, and he earned\r\nhis bread by singing hymns before the houses of the village. At the\r\nage of fifteen, he went to Eisenach, to a high school, and at eighteen\r\nentered the university of Erfurt, where he made considerable progress\r\nin the sciences then usually taught, which, however, were confined\r\nchiefly to the scholastic philosophy. He did not know either Greek or\r\nHebrew, but read the Bible in Latin. In 1505, he took his degree of\r\nbachelor of arts, and, shortly after, his religious struggles\r\ncommenced. He had witnessed a fearful tempest, which alarmed him,\r\nwhile on a visit at his father\'s house, and he was also much depressed\r\nby the death of an intimate friend. In that age, the serious and the\r\nmelancholy generally sought monastic retreats, and Luther, thirsty\r\nafter divine knowledge, and anxious to save his soul, resolved to\r\nforsake the world, and become a monk. He entered an Augustinian\r\nmonastery at Erfurt, soon after obtaining his first degree. But the\r\nduties and studies of monastic life did not give his troubled soul the\r\nrepose he sought. He submitted to all the irksome labors which the\r\nmonks imposed; he studied the fathers and the schoolmen; he practised\r\nthe most painful austerities, and fastings, and self-lacerations:\r\nstill he was troubled with religious fears. His brethren encouraged\r\nhis good works, but his perplexities and doubts remained. In this\r\nstate of mind, he was found by Staupitz, vicar-general of the order,\r\nwho was visiting Erfurt, in his tour of inspection, with a view to\r\ncorrect the bad morals of the monasteries. He sympathized with Luther\r\nin his religious feelings, treated him with great kindness, and\r\nrecommended the reading of the Scriptures, and also the works of St.\r\nAugustine whose theological views he himself had embraced. Although\r\nSt. Augustine was a great oracle in the Roman church, still, his\r\ndoctrines pertaining to personal salvation differed in spirit from\r\nthose which were encouraged by the Roman Catholic divines generally,\r\nwho attached less importance to justification by faith than did the\r\nvenerated bishop of Hyppo. In that age of abuses, great importance was\r\nattached, by the church, to austerities, penance, and absolutions for\r\nmoney. But Luther, deeply imbued with the spirit of Augustine, at\r\nlength found light, and repose, and joy, in the doctrine of\r\njustification by faith alone. This became more and more the idea of\r\nhis life, especially at this time. The firmness of his convictions on\r\nthis point became extraordinary, and his spiritual gladness now\r\nequalled his former depression and anxiety. He was soon to find a\r\nsphere for the development of his views.\r\n\r\nLuther was consecrated as a priest in 1507, and in 1508 he was invited\r\nby Frederic, Elector of Saxony, to become a professor in the new\r\nuniversity which he had established at Wittemberg. He was now\r\ntwenty-five years of age, and the fact, that he should have been\r\nselected, at that early age, to teach dialectics, is a strong argument\r\nin favor of his attainments and genius.\r\n\r\nHe now began to apply himself to the study of the Greek and Hebrew,\r\nand delivered lectures on biblical theology; and his novel method, and\r\ngreat enthusiasm, attracted a crowd of students. But his sermons were\r\nmore striking even than his lectures, and he was invited, by the\r\ncouncil of Wittemberg, to be the preacher for the city. His eloquence,\r\nhis learning, and his zeal, now attracted considerable attention, and\r\nthe elector himself visited Wittemberg to hear him preach.\r\n\r\nIn 1512, he was sent on an embassy to Rome, and, while in Italy,\r\nobtained useful knowledge of the actual state of the hierarchy, and of\r\nmorals and religion. Julius\xc2\xa0II., a warlike pontiff, sat on the throne\r\nof St. Peter; and the "Eternal City" was the scene of folly,\r\ndissipation, and clerical extortion. Luther returned to Germany\r\ncompletely disgusted with every thing he had seen--the levity and\r\nfrivolity of the clergy, and the ignorance and vices of the people. He\r\nwas too earnest in his religious views and feelings to take much\r\ninterest in the works of art, or the pleasures, which occupied the\r\nattention of the Italians; and the impression of the general iniquity\r\nand corruption of Rome never passed away, and probably gave a new\r\ndirection to his thoughts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Luther\'s Early Religious Struggles.]\r\n\r\nOn his return, in 1512, he was made doctor of divinity, then a great\r\ndistinction, and renewed his lectures in the university with great\r\nardor. He gave a new impulse to the studies, and a new form to the\r\nopinions of both professors and students. Lupinus and Carlstadt, his\r\ncolleagues, were converts to his views. All within his sphere were\r\ncontrolled by his commanding genius, and extraordinary force of\r\ncharacter. He commenced war upon the schoolmen, and was peculiarly\r\nhostile to Thomas Aquinas, whom he accused of Pelagianism. He also\r\nattacked Aristotle, the great idol of the schools, and overwhelmed\r\nscholasticism with sarcasm and mockery.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things when the preachers of indulgences, whom\r\nLeo\xc2\xa0X. had encouraged, in order to raise money for St. Peter\'s Church,\r\narrived in the country round the Elbe. They had already spread over\r\nGermany, Switzerland, and France. Their luxury and extravagance were\r\nonly equalled by their presumption and insolence. All sorts of crime\r\nwere pardoned by these people for money. Among the most remarkable of\r\nthese religious swindlers and peddlers was Tetzel. He was a friar of\r\nthe Dominicans, apostolical commissioner, inquisitor, and bachelor of\r\ntheology. He united profligate morals with great pretensions to\r\nsanctity; was somewhat eloquent, so far as a sonorous voice was\r\nconcerned, and was very bold and haughty, as vulgar men, raised to\r\neminence and power, are apt to be. But his peculiarity consisted in\r\nthe audacity of his pretensions, and his readiness in inventing\r\nstories to please the people, ever captivated by rhetoric and\r\nanecdote. "Indulgences," said he, "are the most precious and sublime\r\nof God\'s gifts." "I would not exchange my privileges for those of St.\r\nPeter in heaven; for I have saved more souls, with my indulgences,\r\nthan he, with his sermons." "There is no sin so great that the\r\nindulgence cannot remit it: even repentance is not necessary:\r\nindulgences save not the living alone,--they save the dead." "The very\r\nmoment that the money clinks against the bottom of this chest, the\r\nsoul escapes from purgatory, and flies to heaven." "And do you know\r\nwhy our Lord distributes so rich a grace? The dilapidated Church of\r\nSt. Peter and St. Paul is to be restored, which contains the bodies of\r\nthose holy apostles, and which are now trodden, dishonored, and\r\npolluted."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ninety-Five Propositions.]\r\n\r\nTetzel found but few sufficiently enlightened to resist him, and he\r\nobtained great sums from the credulous people. This abomination\r\nexcited Luther\'s intensest detestation; and he accordingly wrote\r\nninety-five propositions, and nailed them, in 1517, to the gates of\r\nthe church, in which he denounced the traffic in indulgences, and\r\ntraced the doctrine of absolution to the usurped power of the pope. He\r\ndenied the value of his absolution, and maintained that the divine\r\nfavor would only be granted on the condition of repentance and faith.\r\n\r\nIn these celebrated propositions, he struck at the root of scholastic\r\nabsurdities, and also of papal pretensions. The spirit which they\r\nbreathed was bold, intrepid, and magnanimous. They electrified\r\nGermany, and gave a shock to the whole papal edifice. They had both a\r\nreligious and a political bearing; religious, in reference to the\r\ngrounds of justification, and political, in opening men\'s eyes to the\r\nunjust and ruinous extortions of Rome.\r\n\r\nAmong those who perceived with great clearness the political tendency\r\nof these propositions, and rejoiced in it, was the elector of Saxony\r\nhimself, the most powerful prince of the empire, who had long been\r\nvexed, in view of the vast sums which had been drained from his\r\nsubjects. He also lamented the corruptions of the church, and probably\r\nsympathized with the theological opinions of Luther. He accordingly\r\nprotected the bold professor, although he did not openly encourage\r\nhim, or form an alliance with him. He let things take their course.\r\nWell did Frederic deserve the epithet of _Wise_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Erasmus--Melancthon.]\r\n\r\nThere was another great man who rejoiced in the appearance of Luther\'s\r\ntheses; and this was Erasmus, the greatest scholar of his age, the\r\nautocrat of letters, and, at that time, living in Basle. He was born\r\nin Rotterdam, in 1467, of poor parents, but early attracted notice for\r\nhis attainments, and early emancipated himself from the trammels of\r\nscholasticism, which he hated and despised as cordially as Luther\r\nhimself. He also attacked, with elegant sarcasm the absurdities of his\r\nage, both in literature and morals. He denounced the sins and follies\r\nof the monks, and spoke of the necessity of reform. But his\r\ndistinguishing excellence was his literary talent and taste. He was a\r\ngreat Greek scholar, and published a critical edition of the\r\nTestament, which he accompanied with a Latin translation. In this, he\r\nrendered great service to the reformers, especially to Luther. His\r\nfascinating style and extensive erudition gave him great literary\r\nfame. But he was timid, conservative, and vain; and sought to be\r\npopular, except among the monks, whom he uniformly ridiculed. One\r\ndoctor hated him so cordially, that he had his picture hung up in his\r\nstudy, that he might spit in his face as often as he pleased. So far\r\nas Luther opposed monkery and despotism, his sympathies were with him.\r\nBut he did not desire a radical reformation, as Luther did, and always\r\nshunned danger and obloquy. He dreaded an insurrection among the\r\npeople, and any thing which looked either revolutionary or fanatical.\r\nLuther, therefore, much as he was gratified by his favor at first,\r\nsoon learned to distrust him; and finally these two great men were\r\nunfriendly to each other.\r\n\r\nMelancthon was too prominent an actor in the great drama about to be\r\nperformed, to be omitted in this sketch of great men who were on the\r\nside of reform. He was born in 1497, and was, therefore, fourteen\r\nyears younger than Luther. He was educated under the auspices of the\r\ncelebrated Greek scholar Reuchlin, who was also a relative. At twelve,\r\nhe was sent to the university of Heidelberg; at fourteen, was made\r\nbachelor of arts; and at seventeen, doctor of philosophy. He began to\r\nlecture publicly at the age of seventeen; and, for his extraordinary\r\nattainments, was invited to Wittemberg, as professor of ancient\r\nlanguages, at the age of twenty-one. He arrived there in 1518, and\r\nimmediately fell under the influence of Luther, who, however,\r\nacknowledged his classical attainments. He was considered a prodigy;\r\nwas remarkably young looking, and so boyish, that the grave professors\r\nconceived but little hope of him at first. But, when he delivered his\r\ninaugural oration in Latin, all were astonished; and their prejudices\r\nwere removed. Luther himself was enthusiastic in his praises, and a\r\nfriendship commenced between them, which was never weakened by a\r\nquarrel. The mildness and gentleness of Philip Melancthon strongly\r\ncontrasted with the boldness, energy, and tumultuous passions of\r\nLuther. The former was the more learned and elegant; the latter was\r\nthe superior genius--a genius for commanding men, and guiding great\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Melancthon--Leo\xc2\xa0X.]\r\n\r\nBut there was another great personage, who now viewed the movement of\r\nLuther with any thing but indifference; and this was Leo\xc2\xa0X., the\r\nreigning pope when the theses were published. He belonged to the\r\nillustrious family of the Medici, and was chosen cardinal at the age\r\nof thirteen. He was the most elegant and accomplished of all the\r\npopes, patronized art and literature, and ornamented his capital with\r\npalaces, churches, and statues. But with his sympathy for intellectual\r\nexcellence, he was prodigal, luxurious, and worldly. Indeed, his\r\nspirit was almost infidel. He was more ambitious for temporal than\r\nspiritual power; and, when he commenced his reign, the papal\r\npossessions were more extensive and flourishing, than at any previous\r\nperiod. His leading error was, his recklessness in the imposition of\r\ntaxes, even on the clergy themselves, by which he lost their\r\nconfidence and regard. With a very fine mind, he was, nevertheless,\r\nquite unfitted for his station and his times.\r\n\r\nThus far, he had allowed the outcry which Luther had raised against\r\nindulgences to take its course, and even disregarded the theses, which\r\nhe supposed originated in a monkish squabble. But the Emperor\r\nMaximilian was alarmed, and wrote to the pope an account of Luther\'s\r\ndifferences with Tetzel. Frederic of Saxony had also written to his\r\nholiness, to palliate the conduct of Luther.\r\n\r\nWhen such powerful princes became interested, Leo was startled. He\r\nsummoned Luther to Rome, to be tried by Prierias. Luther, not daring\r\nto refuse, and not willing to obey, wrote to his friend Spalatin to\r\nuse his influence with the elector to have his cause tried in Germany;\r\nand the pope, willing to please Frederic, appointed De Vio, his\r\nlegate, to investigate the matter. Luther accordingly set out for\r\nAugsburg, in obedience to the summons of De Vio, although dissuaded by\r\nmany of his friends. He had several interviews with the legate, by\r\nwhom he was treated with courtesy and urbanity, and by whom he was\r\ndissuaded from his present courses. But all the persuasion and\r\nargument of the cardinal legate were without effect on the mind of\r\nLuther, whose convictions were not to be put aside by either kindness\r\nor craft. De Vio had hoped that he could induce Luther to retract;\r\nbut, when he found him fixed in his resolutions, he changed his tone,\r\nand resorted to threats. Luther then made up his mind to leave\r\nAugsburg; and, appealing to the decision of the sovereign pontiff,\r\nwhose authority he had not yet openly defied, he fled from the city,\r\nand returned to Wittemberg, being countenanced by the elector, to whom\r\nhe also addressed letters. His life was safe so long as Frederic\r\nprotected him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Leipsic Disputation.]\r\n\r\nThe next event in the progress of Luther was the Leipsic disputation,\r\nJune, 1519. The pope seemed willing to make one more effort to\r\nconvince Luther, before he proceeded to more violent courses. There\r\nwas then at his court a noble Saxon, Charles Miltitz, whose talents\r\nand insinuating address secured him the high office of chamberlain to\r\nthe pope. He accordingly was sent into his native country, with the\r\ndignity of legate, to remove the difficulties which De Vio had\r\nattempted. He tried persuasion and flattery, and treated the reformer\r\nwith great civility. But Luther still persisted in refusing to\r\nretract, and the matter was referred to the elector archbishop of\r\nTr\xc3\xa8ves.\r\n\r\nWhile the controversy was pending, Dr. Eck, of the university of\r\nIngolstadt, a man of great scholastic ingenuity and attainment, and\r\nproud of the prizes of eight universities, challenged the professors\r\nof Wittemberg to a public controversy on Grace and Free Will. He\r\nregarded a disputation with the eye of a practised fencer, and sought\r\nthe means of extending his fame over North Germany. Leipsic was the\r\nappointed arena, and thither resorted the noble and the learned of\r\nSaxony. Eck was among the first who arrived, and, soon after, came\r\nCarlstadt, Luther, and Melancthon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Principles of the Leipsic Disputation.]\r\n\r\nThe place for the combat was a hall in the royal palace of Duke\r\nGeorge, cousin to the elector Frederic, which was arranged and\r\nornamented with great care, and which was honored by the presence of\r\nthe duke, and of the chief divines and nobles of Northern Germany.\r\nCarlstadt opened the debate, which did not excite much interest until\r\nLuther\'s turn came, the antagonist whom Eck was most desirous to meet,\r\nand whose rising fame he hoped to crush by a brilliant victory. Ranke\r\nthus describes Luther\'s person at this time. "He was of the middle\r\nsize, and so thin as to be mere skin and bone. He possessed neither\r\nthe thundering voice, nor the ready memory, nor the skill and\r\ndexterity, of his distinguished antagonist. But he stood in the prime\r\nof manhood and in the fulness of his strength. His voice was melodious\r\nand clear; he was perfectly versed in the Bible, and its aptest\r\nsentences presented themselves unbidden to his mind; above all, he\r\ninspired an irresistible conviction that he sought the truth. He was\r\nalways cheerful at home, and a joyous, jocose companion at table; he\r\neven, on this grave occasion, ascended the platform with a nosegay in\r\nhis hand; but, when there, he displayed the intrepid and\r\nself-forgetting earnestness arising from the depth of a conviction,\r\nuntil now, unfathomed, even by himself. He drew forth new thoughts,\r\nand placed them in the fire of the battle, with a determination that\r\nknew no fear and no personal regard. His features bore the traces of\r\nthe storms that had passed over his soul, and of the courage with\r\nwhich he was prepared to encounter those which yet awaited him. His\r\nwhole aspect evinced profound thought, joyousness of temper, and\r\nconfidence in the future. The battle immediately commenced on the\r\nquestion of the authority of the papacy, which, at once intelligible\r\nand important, riveted universal attention." Eck, with great erudition\r\nand masterly logic, supported the claim of the pope, from the decrees\r\nof councils, the opinions of scholastics, and even from those\r\ncelebrated words of Christ to Peter--"Thou art Peter, and on this rock\r\nwill I build my church," &c. Luther took higher and bolder ground,\r\ndenied the infallibility of councils, and appealed to Scripture as the\r\nultimate authority. Eck had probably the advantage over his\r\nantagonist, so far as dialectics were concerned, being a more able\r\ndisputant; but Luther set at defiance mere scholastic logic, and\r\nappealed to an authority which dialectics could not reach. The victory\r\nwas claimed by both parties; but the result was, that Luther no longer\r\nacknowledged the authority of the Roman church, and acknowledged none\r\nbut the Scriptures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rights of Private Judgment.]\r\n\r\nThe Leipsic disputation was the grand intellectual contest of the\r\nReformation, and developed its great idea--the only great principle,\r\naround which all sects and parties among the Protestants rally. This\r\nis the idea, that _the Scriptures are the only ultimate grounds of\r\nauthority in religion, and that, moreover, every man has a right to\r\ninterpret them for himself_. The rights of private judgment--that\r\nreligion is a matter between the individual soul and God, and that\r\nevery man is answerable to his own conscience alone how he interprets\r\nScripture--these constitute the great Protestant platform. Different\r\nsects have different views respecting justification, but all profess\r\nto trace them to the Scriptures. Luther\'s views were similar to those\r\nof St. Augustine--that "man could be justified by faith alone," which\r\nwas _his_ great theological doctrine--a doctrine adopted by many who\r\nnever left the communion of the Church of Rome, before and since his\r\nday, and a doctrine which characterized the early reformers, Zwingle,\r\nCalvin, Knox, Cranmer, and the Puritans generally. It is as absurd to\r\nsay that Luther\'s animating principle in religion was not this\r\ndoctrine, as it is unphilosophical to make the reformation consist\r\nmerely in its recognition. After Luther\'s convictions were settled on\r\nthis point, and he had generally and openly declared them, the main\r\ncontest of his life was against the papacy, which he viewed as the\r\npredicted Antichrist--the "scarlet mother of abominations." It is not\r\nthe object of the writer of this History to defend or oppose Luther\'s\r\nviews, or argue any cause whatever, but simply to place facts in their\r\ntrue light, which is, to state them candidly.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Leipsic controversy brought out the great principle of\r\nthe Reformation, Luther\'s views, both respecting the true doctrines\r\nand polity of the church, were not, on all points, yet developed, and\r\nwere only gradually unfolded, as he gained knowledge and light. It was\r\nno trifling matter, even to deny the supremacy of the Roman church in\r\nmatters of faith. He was thus placed in the position of Huss and\r\nJerome, and other reformers, who had been destroyed, with scarcely an\r\nexception. He thus was brought in direct conflict with the pope, with\r\nthe great dignitaries of the church, with the universities, and with\r\nthe whole scholastic literature. He had to expect the violent\r\nopposition and vengeance of the pope, of the monks, of the great\r\necclesiastical dignitaries, of the most distinguished scholars, and of\r\nthose secular princes who were friendly to Rome. He had none to\r\nprotect him but a prince of the empire, powerful, indeed, and wise,\r\nbut old and wavering. There were but few to uphold and defend him--the\r\nsatirical Erasmus, who was called a second Lucian, the feeble\r\nStaupitz, the fanatical Carlstadt, and the inexperienced Melancthon.\r\nThe worldly-minded, the learned, the powerful, and the conservative\r\nclasses were his natural enemies. But he had reason and Scripture on\r\nhis side, and he appealed to their great and final verdict. He had\r\nsingular faith in the power of truth, and the gracious protection of\r\nGod Almighty. Reposing on the greatness of his cause, and the\r\nprovidence of the omnipotent Protector, he was ready to defy all the\r\narts, and theories, and malice of man. His weapon was truth. For truth\r\nhe fought, and for truth he was ready to die. The sophistries of the\r\nschools he despised; they had distorted and mystified the truth. And\r\nhe knew them well, for he had been trained in the severest dialectics\r\nof his time, and, though he despised them, he knew how to use them.\r\nThe simple word of God, directed to the reason and conscience of men,\r\nseemed alone worthy of his regard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Luther\'s Elements of Greatness.]\r\n\r\nBut, beside Scripture and unperverted reason, he had another element\r\nof power. He was master of the sympathies and passions of the people.\r\nHis father was a toiling miner. His grandfather was a peasant. He had\r\nbeen trained to penury; he had associated with the poor; he was a man\r\nof the people; he was their natural friend. He saw and lamented their\r\nburdens, and rose up for their deliverance. And the people\r\ndistinguished their true friend, from their false friends. They saw\r\nthe sincerity, earnestness, and labors of the new apostle of liberty,\r\nand believed in him, and made an idol of him. They would protect him,\r\nand honor him, and obey him, and believe what he taught them, for he\r\nwas their friend, whom God had raised up to take off their burdens,\r\nand point a way to heaven, without the intercession of priests, or\r\nindulgences, or penance. Their friend was to expose the corruptions of\r\nthe clergy, and to give battle to the great arch enemy who built St.\r\nPeter\'s Church from their hard-earned pittances. A spirit from heaven\r\nenlightened those to whom Luther preached, and they rallied around his\r\nstandard, and swore never to separate, until the great enemies of the\r\npoor and the oppressed were rendered powerless. And their sympathies\r\nwere needed, and best services, too; for the great man of the age--the\r\nincarnated spirit of liberty--was in danger.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excommunication of Luther.]\r\n\r\nThe pope, hitherto mild, persuasive, and undecided, now arose in the\r\nmajesty of his mighty name, and, as the successor of St. Peter, hurled\r\nthose weapons which had been thunderbolts in the hands of the\r\nGregories and the Innocents. From his papal throne, and with all the\r\nsolemnity of God\'s appointed vicegerent, he denounced the daring monk\r\nof Wittemberg, and sentenced him to the wrath of God, and to the\r\npenalty of eternal fire. Luther was excommunicated by a papal bull,\r\nand his writings were condemned as heretical and damnable.\r\n\r\nThis was a dreadful sentence. Few had ever resisted it successfully,\r\neven monarchs themselves. Excommunication was still a fearful weapon,\r\nand used only in desperate circumstances. It was used only as the last\r\nresort; for frequency would destroy its power. In the middle ages,\r\nthis weapon was omnipotent; and the middle ages had but just passed\r\naway. No one could stand before that awful anathema which consigned\r\nhim to the wrath of incensed and implacable Deity. Much as some\r\nprofessed to despise the sentence, still, when inflicted, it could not\r\nbe borne, especially if accompanied with an interdict. Children were\r\nleft unburied. The churches were closed. The rites of religion were\r\nsuspended. A funereal shade was spread over society. The fears of hell\r\nhaunted every imagination. No reason was strong enough to resist the\r\nsentence. No arm was sufficiently powerful to remove the curse. It\r\nhung over a guilty land. It doomed the unhappy offender, who was\r\ncursed, wherever he went, and in whatever work he was engaged.\r\n\r\nBut Luther was strong enough to resist it, and to despise it. He saw\r\nit was an imposition, which only barbarous and ignorant ages had\r\npermitted. Moreover, he perceived that there was now no alternative\r\nbut victory or death; that, in the great contest in which he was\r\nengaged, retreat was infamy. Nor did he wish to retreat. He was\r\nfighting for oppressed humanity, and death even, in such a cause, was\r\nglory. He understood fully the nature and the consequence of the\r\nstruggle. He perceived the greatness of the odds against him, in a\r\nworldly point of view. No man but a Luther would have been equal to\r\nit; no man, before him, ever had successfully rebelled against the\r\npope. It is only in view of this circumstance, that his intrepidity\r\ncan be appreciated.\r\n\r\nWhat did the Saxon monk do, when the papal bull was published? He\r\nassembled the professors and students of the university, declared his\r\nsolemn protest against the pope as Antichrist, and marched in\r\nprocession to the gates of the Castle of Wittemberg, and there made a\r\nbonfire, and cast into it the bull which condemned him, the canon law,\r\nand some writings of the schoolmen, and then re\xc3\xabntered the city,\r\nbreathing defiance against the whole power of the pope, glowing in the\r\nconsciousness that the battle had commenced, to last as long as life,\r\nand perfectly secure that the victory would finally be on the side of\r\ntruth. This was in 1520, on the 10th of December.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the whole nation was necessarily drawn to this open\r\nresistance; and the sympathy of the free thinking, the earnest, and\r\nthe religious, was expressed for him. Never was popular interest more\r\nabsorbing, in respect to his opinions, his fortunes, and his fate. The\r\nspirit of innovation became contagious, and pervaded the German mind.\r\nIt demanded the serious attention of the emperor himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Diet of Worms.]\r\n\r\nA great Diet of the empire was convened at Worms, and thither Luther\r\nwas summoned by the temporal power. He had a safe-conduct, which even\r\nso powerful a prince as Charles\xc2\xa0V. durst not violate. In April, 1521,\r\nthe reformer appeared before the collected dignitaries of the German\r\nempire, both spiritual and temporal, and was called upon to recant his\r\nopinions as heretical in the eyes of the church, and dangerous to the\r\npeace of the empire. Before the most august assembly in the world,\r\nwithout a trace of embarrassment, he made his defence, and refused to\r\nrecant. "Unless," said he, "my errors can be demonstrated by texts\r\nfrom Scripture, I will not and cannot recant; for it is not safe for a\r\nman to go against his conscience. Here I am. I can do no otherwise.\r\nGod help me! Amen."\r\n\r\nThis declaration satisfied his friends, though it did not satisfy the\r\nmembers of the diet. Luther was permitted to retire. He had gained the\r\nconfidence of the nation. From that time, he was its idol, and the\r\nacknowledged leader of the greatest insurrection of human intelligence\r\nwhich modern times have seen. The great principles of the reformation\r\nwere declared. The great hero of the Reformation had planted his cause\r\nupon a rock. And yet his labors had but just commenced. Henceforth,\r\nhis life was toil and vexation. New difficulties continually arose.\r\nNew questions had to be continually settled. Luther, by his letters,\r\nwas every where. He commenced the translation of the Scriptures; he\r\nwrote endless controversial tracts; his correspondence was\r\nunparalleled; his efforts as a preacher were prodigious. But he was\r\nequal to it all; was wonderfully adapted to his age and circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Imprisonment at Wartburg.]\r\n\r\nAbout this time commenced his voluntary imprisonment at Wartburg,\r\namong the Thuringian forests: he being probably conducted thither by\r\nthe orders of the elector of Saxony. Here he was out of sight, but not\r\nout of mind; and his retirement, under the disguise of a knight, gave\r\nhim leisure for literary labor. In the old Castle of Wartburg, a great\r\npart of the Scriptures was translated into that beautiful and simple\r\nversion, which is still the standard of the German language.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carlstadt.]\r\n\r\nWhile Luther was translating the Scriptures, in his retreat,\r\nWittemberg was the scene of new commotions, pregnant with great\r\nresults. There were many of the more zealous converts to the reformed\r\ndoctrines, headed by Carlstadt, dean of the faculty of theology, who\r\nwere not content with the progress which had been made, and who\r\ndesired more sweeping and radical changes. Such a party ever exists in\r\nall reforms; for there are some persons who are always inclined to\r\nultra and extravagant courses. Carlstadt was a type of such men. He\r\nwas learned, sincere, and amiable, but did not know where to stop; and\r\nthe experiment was now to be tried, whether it was possible to\r\nintroduce a necessary reform, without annihilating also all the\r\nresults of the labors of preceding generations. Carlstadt\'s mind was\r\nnot well balanced, and to him the reformation was only a half measure,\r\nand a useless movement, unless all the external observances of\r\nreligion and the whole economy of the church were destroyed. He\r\nabolished, or desired to abolish, all priestly garments, all fasts and\r\nholydays, all pictures in the churches, and all emblematical\r\nceremonies of every kind. He insisted upon closing all places of\r\npublic amusement, the abolition of all religious communities, and the\r\ndivision of their possessions among the poor. He maintained that there\r\nwas no need of learning, or of academic studies, and even went into\r\nthe houses of the peasantry to seek explanation of difficult passages\r\nof Scripture. For such innovations, the age was certainly not\r\nprepared, even had they been founded on reason; and the conservative\r\nmind of Luther was shocked at extravagances which served to disgust\r\nthe whole Christian world, and jeopardize the cause in which he had\r\nembarked. So, against the entreaties of the elector, and in spite of\r\nthe ban of the empire, he returned to Wittemberg, a small city, it was\r\ntrue, but a place to which had congregated the flower of the German\r\nyouth. He resolved to oppose the movements of Carlstadt, even though\r\nopposition should destroy his influence. Especially did he declare\r\nagainst all violent measures to which the ultra reformers were\r\ninclined, knowing full well, that, if his cause were sullied with\r\nviolence or fanaticism, all Christendom would unite to suppress it.\r\nHis sermons are, at this time, (1522,) pervaded with a profound and\r\nconservative spirit, and also a spirit of conciliation and love,\r\ncalculated to calm passions, and carry conviction to excited minds.\r\nHis moderate counsels prevailed, the tumults were hushed, and order\r\nwas restored. Carlstadt was silenced for a time; but a mind like his\r\ncould not rest, especially on points where he had truth on his side.\r\nOne of these was, in reference to the presence of Christ\'s body in the\r\nEucharist, which Carlstadt totally denied. He taught "that the Lord\'s\r\nsupper was purely symbolic, and was simply a pledge to believers of\r\ntheir redemption." But Luther saw, in every attempt to exhibit the\r\nsymbolical import of the supper, only the danger of weakening the\r\nauthority of Scripture, which was his stronghold, and became\r\nexceedingly tenacious on that point; carried his views to the extreme\r\nof literal interpretation, and never could emancipate himself from the\r\ndoctrines of Rome respecting the eucharist. Carlstadt, finding himself\r\npersecuted at Wittemberg left the city, and, as soon as he was\r\nreleased from the presence of Luther, began to revive his former zeal\r\nagainst images also, and was the promoter of great disturbances. He at\r\nlast sought refuge in Strasburg, and sacrificed fame, and friends, and\r\nbread to his honest convictions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thomas M\xc3\xbcnzer.]\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, the views of Carlstadt found advocates, and his\r\nextravagances were copied with still greater zeal. Many pretended to\r\nspecial divine illumination--the great central principle of all\r\nfanaticism. Among these was Thomas M\xc3\xbcnzer, of Zwickau, mystical,\r\nignorant, and conceited, but sincere and simple hearted. "Luther,"\r\nsaid he, "has liberated men\'s consciences from the papal yoke, but has\r\nnot led them in spirit towards God." Considering himself as called\r\nupon by a special revelation to bring men into greater spiritual\r\nliberty, he went about inflaming the popular mind, and raising\r\ndiscontents, and even inciting to a revolt. Religion now became\r\nmingled with politics, and social and political evils were violently\r\nresisted, under the garb of religion. An insurrection at last arose in\r\nthe districts of the Black Forest, (1524,) near the sources of the\r\nDanube, and spread from Suabia to the Rhine provinces, until it became\r\nexceedingly formidable. Then commenced what is called the "peasants\'\r\nwar," which was only ended by the slaughter of fifty thousand people.\r\nAs the causes of this war, after all, were chiefly political, the\r\ndetails belong to our chapter on political history. For this\r\ninsurrection of the peasantry, however, Luther expressed great\r\ndetestation; although he availed himself of it to lecture the princes\r\nof Germany on their duties as civil rulers.\r\n\r\nThe peasant war was scarcely ended, when Luther married Catharine\r\nBora; and, as she was a nun, and he was a monk, the marriage gave\r\nuniversal scandal. But this marriage, which proved happy, was the\r\nsignal of new reforms. Luther now emancipated himself from his\r\nmonastic fetters, and lifted up his voice against the whole monastic\r\nsystem. Eight years had elapsed since he preached against indulgences.\r\nDuring these eight years, reform had been gradual, and had now\r\nadvanced to the extreme limit it ever reached during the life of the\r\nreformer.\r\n\r\nBut, in another quarter, it sprang up with new force, and was carried\r\nto an extent not favored in Germany. It was in Switzerland that the\r\ngreatest approximation was made to the forms, if not to the spirit, of\r\nprimitive Christianity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ulric Zwingle.]\r\n\r\nThe great hero of this Swiss movement was Ulric Zwingle, the most\r\ninteresting of all the reformers. He was born in 1484, and educated\r\namid the mountains of his picturesque country, and, like Erasmus,\r\nReuchlin, Luther, and Melancthon, had no aristocratic claims, except\r\nto the nobility of nature. But, though poor, he was well educated, and\r\nwas a master of the scholastic philosophy and of all the learning of\r\nhis age. Like Luther, he was passionately fond of music, and played\r\nthe lute, the harp, the violin, the flute and the dulcimer. There was\r\nno more joyous spirit in all Switzerland than his. Every one loved his\r\nsociety, and honored his attainments, and admired his genius. Like\r\nLuther and Erasmus, he was disgusted with scholasticism, and regretted\r\nthe time he had devoted to its study. He was ordained in 1506, by the\r\nbishop of Constance, and was settled in Zurich in 1518. At first, his\r\nlife did not differ from that which the clergy generally led, being\r\none of dissipation and pleasure. But he was studious, and became well\r\nacquainted with the fathers, and with the original Greek. Only\r\ngradually did light dawn upon him, and this in consequence of his\r\nstudy of the Scriptures, not in consequence of Luther\'s preaching. He\r\nhad no tempests to withstand, such as shook the soul of the Saxon\r\nmonk. Nor had he ever devoted himself with the same ardor to the\r\nestablished church. Nor was he so much interested on doctrinal points\r\nof faith. But he saw with equal clearness the corruptions of the\r\nchurch, and preached with equal zeal against indulgences and the\r\nusurpations of the popes. The reformation of morals was the great aim\r\nof his life. His preaching was practical and simple, and his doctrine\r\nwas, that "religion consisted in trust in God, loving God, and\r\ninnocence of life." Moreover, he took a deep interest in the political\r\nrelations of his country, and was an enthusiast in liberty as well as\r\nin religion. To him the town of Zurich was indebted for its\r\nemancipation from the episcopal government of Constance, and also for\r\na reformation in all the externals of the church. He inspired the\r\ncitizens with that positive spirit of Protestantism, which afterwards\r\ncharacterized Calvin and the Puritans. He was too radical a reformer\r\nto suit Luther, although he sympathized with most of his theological\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Controversy between Luther and Zwingle.]\r\n\r\nOn one point, however, they differed; and this difference led to an\r\nacrimonious contest, quite disgraceful to Luther, and the greatest\r\nblot on his character, inasmuch as it developed, to an extraordinary\r\ndegree, both obstinacy and dogmatism, and showed that he could not\r\nbear contradiction or opposition. The quarrel arose from a difference\r\nof views respecting the Lord\'s supper, Luther maintaining not exactly\r\nthe Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, but something\r\napproximating to it--even the omnipresence of Christ\'s body in the\r\nsacred elements. He relinquished the doctrine of the continually\r\nrepeated miracle, but substituted a universal miracle, wrought once\r\nfor all. In his tenacity to the opinions of the schoolmen on this\r\npoint, we see his conservative spirit; for he did not deny tradition,\r\nunless it was expressly contradicted by Scripture. He would have\r\nmaintained the whole structure of the Latin church, had it not been\r\ndisfigured by modern additions, plainly at variance with the\r\nScriptures; and so profoundly was he attached to the traditions of the\r\nchurch, and to the whole church establishment, that he only\r\nemancipated himself by violent inward storms. But Zwingle had not this\r\nlively conception of the universal church, and was more radical in his\r\nsympathies. He took Carlstadt\'s view of the supper, that it was merely\r\nsymbolic. Still he shrunk from a rupture with Luther, which, however,\r\nwas unavoidable, considering Luther\'s views of the subject and his\r\ncast of mind. Luther rejected all offers of conciliation, and, as he\r\nconsidered it essential to salvation to believe in the real presence\r\nof Christ in the sacrament, he refused to acknowledge Zwingle as a\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nZwingle, nevertheless, continued his reforms, and sought to restore,\r\nwhat he conceived to be, the earliest forms in which Christianity had\r\nmanifested itself. He designed to restore a worship purely spiritual.\r\nHe rejected all rites and ceremonies, not expressly enjoined in the\r\nBible. Luther insisted in retaining all that was not expressly\r\nforbidden. And this was the main point of distinction between them and\r\ntheir adherents.\r\n\r\nBut Zwingle contemplated political, as well as religious, changes,\r\nand, as early as 1527, two years before his conference with Luther at\r\nMarburg, had projected a league of all the reformers against the\r\npolitical authorities which opposed their progress. He combated the\r\nabuses of the state, as well as of the church. This opposition created\r\ngreat enemies against him among the cantons, with their different\r\ngovernments and alliances. He also secured enthusiastic friends, and,\r\nin all the cantons, there was a strong democratic party opposed to the\r\nexisting oligarchies, which party, in Berne and Basle, St. Gall,\r\nZurich, Appenzell, Schaffhausen, and Glarus, obtained the ascendency.\r\nThis led to tumults and violence, and finally to civil war between the\r\ndifferent cantons, those which adhered to the old faith being assisted\r\nby Austria. Lucerne, Uri Schwytz, Zug, Unterwalden took the lead\r\nagainst the reformed cantons, the foremost of which was Zurich, where\r\nZwingle lived. Zurich was attacked. Zwingle, from impulses of\r\npatriotism and courage, issued forth from his house, and joined the\r\nstandard of his countrymen, not as a chaplain, but as an armed\r\nwarrior. This was his mistake. "They who take the sword shall perish\r\nwith the sword." The intrepid and enlightened reformer was slain in\r\n1531, and, with his death, expired the hopes of his party. The\r\nrestoration of the Roman Catholic religion immediately commenced in\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nLuther, more wise than Zwingle, inasmuch as he abstained from\r\npolitics, continued his labors in Germany. And they were immense. The\r\nburdens of his country rested on his shoulders. He was the dictator of\r\nthe reformed party, and his word was received as law. Moreover, the\r\nparty continually increased, and, from the support it received from\r\nsome of the most powerful of the German princes, it became formidable,\r\neven in a political point of view. Nearly one half of Germany embraced\r\nthe reformed faith.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diet of Augsburg.]\r\n\r\nThe illustrious Charles\xc2\xa0V. had now, for some time, been emperor, and,\r\nin the prosecution of his conquests, found it necessary to secure the\r\nsupport of united Germany, especially since Germany was now invaded by\r\nthe Turks. In order to secure this support, he found it necessary to\r\nmake concessions in religion to his Protestant subjects. At the diet\r\nof Augsburg, (1530,) where there was the most brilliant assemblage of\r\nprinces which had been for a long time seen in Germany, the celebrated\r\nconfession of the faith of the Protestants was read. It was written by\r\nMelancthon, in both Latin and German, on the basis of the articles of\r\nTorgau, which Luther had prepared. The style was Melancthon\'s; the\r\nmatter was Luther\'s. It was comprised in twenty-eight articles, of\r\nwhich twenty-one pertained to the faith of the Protestants--the name\r\nthey assumed at the second diet of Spires, in 1529--and the remaining\r\nseven recounted the errors and abuses of Rome. It was subscribed by\r\nthe Elector of Saxony, the Marquis of Brandenburg, the Duke of\r\nLunenburg, the Landgrave of Hesse, the Prince of Anhalt, and the\r\ndeputies of the imperial cities Nuremberg and Reutlingen. But the\r\nCatholics had the ascendency in the diet, and the "Confession of\r\nAugsburg" was condemned. But the emperor did not venture on any\r\ndecisive measures for the extirpation of the "heresy." He threatened\r\nand published edicts, but his menaces had but little force.\r\nNevertheless, the Protestant princes assembled, first at Smalcalde,\r\nand afterwards at Frankfort, for an alliance of mutual defence,--the\r\nfirst effective union of free princes and states against their\r\noppressors in modern Europe,--and laid the foundation of liberty of\r\nconscience. Hostilities, however, did not commence, since the emperor\r\nwas desirous of uniting Germany against the Turks; and he therefore\r\nrecalled his edicts of Worms and Augsburg against the Protestants, and\r\nmade important concessions, and promised them undisturbed enjoyment of\r\ntheir religion. This was a great triumph to the Protestants, and as\r\ngreat a shock to the Papal power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: League of Smalcalde.]\r\n\r\nThe Confession of Augsburg and the League of Smalcalde form an\r\nimportant era of Protestantism, since, by these, the reformed faith\r\nreceived its definite form, and was moreover guaranteed. The work for\r\nwhich Luther had been raised up was now, in the main, accomplished.\r\nHis great message had been delivered and heard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death and Character of Luther.]\r\n\r\nAfter the confirmation of his cause, his life was perplexed and\r\nanxious. He had not anticipated those civil commotions which he now\r\nsaw, sooner or later, were inevitable. With the increase of his party\r\nwas the decline of spirituality. Political considerations, also, with\r\nmany, were more prominent than moral. Religion and politics were\r\nmingled together, not soon to be separated in the progress of reform.\r\nMoreover, the reformers differed upon many points among themselves.\r\nThere was a lamentable want of harmony between the Germans and the\r\nSwiss. Luther had quarrelled with nearly every prominent person with\r\nwhom he had been associated, except Melancthon, who yielded to him\r\nimplicit obedience. But, above all, the Anabaptist disorders, which he\r\ndetested, and which distracted the whole bishopric of M\xc3\xbcnster,\r\noppressed and mortified him. Worn out with cares, labors, and\r\nvexations, which ever have disturbed the peace and alloyed the\r\nhappiness of great heroes, and from which no greatness is exempt, he\r\ndied at Eisleben, in 1545, while on a visit to his native place in\r\nolder to reconcile dissensions between the counts of Mansfeldt.\r\n\r\nLuther\'s name is still reverenced in Germany, and, throughout all\r\nProtestant countries, he is regarded as the greatest man connected\r\nwith the history of the church since the apostolic age. Others have\r\nbeen greater geniuses, others more learned, others more devout, and\r\nothers more amiable and interesting; but none ever evinced greater\r\nintrepidity, or combined greater qualities of mind and heart. He had\r\nhis faults: he was irritable, dogmatic, and abusive in his\r\ncontroversial writings. He had no toleration for those who differed\r\nfrom him--the fault of the age. But he was genial, joyous, friendly,\r\nand disinterested. His labors were gigantic; his sincerity\r\nunimpeached; his piety enlightened; his zeal unquenchable.\r\nCircumstances and the new ideas of his age, favored him, but he made\r\nhimself master of those circumstances and ideas, and, what is more,\r\nworked out ideas of his own, which were in harmony with Christianity.\r\nThe Reformation would have happened had there been no Luther, though\r\nat a less favorable time; but, of all the men of his age that the\r\nReformation could least spare, Martin Luther stands pre\xc3\xabminent. As the\r\ngreatest of reformers, his name will be ever honored.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--The attention of the student is directed only\r\n     to the most prominent and valuable works which treat of\r\n     Luther and the Protestant reformation.

As\r\nhereditary sovereign of Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and the Tyrol, he\r\nhad absolute authority in his feudal provinces; while, as an elected\r\nemperor, he had an indirect influence over Saxony, the Palatinate, the\r\nthree archbishoprics of Tr\xc3\xa8ves, Mentz, and Cologne, and some\r\nBurgundian territories.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spain and France in the Fifteenth Century.]\r\n\r\nBut the most powerful monarchy, at this time, was probably that of\r\nFrance; and its capital was the finest city in Europe, and the resort\r\nof the learned and elegant from all parts of Christendom. All\r\nstrangers extolled the splendor of the court, the wealth of the\r\nnobles, and the fame of the university. The power of the monarch was\r\nnearly absolute, and a considerable standing army, even then, was\r\nready to obey his commands.\r\n\r\nSpain, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, was ruled by\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, who, by their marriage, had united the crowns\r\nof Castile and Arragon. The conquest of Granada and the discovery of\r\nAmerica had added greatly to the political importance of Spain, and\r\nlaid the foundation of its future greatness under Philip\xc2\xa0II.\r\n\r\nEngland, from its insular position, had not so much influence in\r\nEuropean politics as the other powers to which allusion has been made,\r\nbut it was, nevertheless, a flourishing and united kingdom.\r\nHenry\xc2\xa0VII., the founder of the house of Tudor, sat on the throne, and\r\nwas successful in suppressing the power of the feudal nobility, and in\r\nincreasing the royal authority. Kings, in the fifteenth century, were\r\nthe best protectors of the people, and aided them in their struggles\r\nagainst their feudal oppressors. England, however, had made but little\r\nadvance in commerce or manufactures, and the people were still rude\r\nand ignorant. The clergy, as in other countries, were the most\r\nintelligent and wealthy portion of the population, and, consequently,\r\nthe most influential, although disgraced by many vices.\r\n\r\nItaly then, as now, was divided into many independent states, and\r\ndistracted by civil and religious dissensions. The duchy of Milan was\r\nruled by Ludovico Moro, son of the celebrated Francis Sforza. Naples,\r\ncalled a kingdom, had just been conquered by the French. Florence was\r\nunder the sway of the Medici. Venice, whose commercial importance had\r\nbegun to decline, was controlled by an oligarchy of nobles. The chair\r\nof St. Peter was filled by pope Alexander\xc2\xa0VI., a pontiff who has\r\nobtained an infamous immortality by the vices of debauchery, cruelty,\r\nand treachery. The papacy was probably in its most corrupt state, and\r\nthose who had the control of its immense patronage, disregarded the\r\nloud call for reformation which was raised in every corner of\r\nChristendom. The popes were intent upon securing temporal as well as\r\nspiritual power, and levied oppressive taxes on both their spiritual\r\nand temporal subjects.\r\n\r\nThe great northern kingdoms of Europe, which are now so\r\nconsiderable,--Russia, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway,--did not, at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century, attract much attention. They were\r\nplunged in barbarism and despotism, and the light of science or\r\nreligion rarely penetrated into the interior. The monarchs were\r\nsensual and cruel, the nobles profligate and rapacious, the clergy\r\nignorant and corrupt, and the people degraded, and yet insensible to\r\ntheir degradation, with no aspirations for freedom and no appreciation\r\nof the benefits of civilization. Such heroes as Peter and Gustavus\r\nAdolphus had not yet appeared. Nor were these northern nations\r\ndestined to be immediately benefited by the impulse which the\r\nreformation gave, with the exception of Sweden, then the most powerful\r\nof these kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThe Greek empire became extinct when Constantinople was taken by the\r\nTurks, in 1453. On its ruins, the Ottoman power was raised. At the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century, the Turkish arms were very powerful,\r\nand Europe again trembled before the Moslems. Greece and the whole of\r\nWestern Asia were obedient to the sultan. But his power did not reach\r\nits culminating point until a century afterwards.\r\n\r\nSuch were the various states of Europe when the Reformation broke out.\r\nMaximilian was emperor of Germany, and Charles\xc2\xa0V. had just inherited,\r\nfrom his father, Philip the Fair, who had married a daughter of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, the kingdom of Spain, in addition to the\r\ndominion of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nBy the death of Maximilian, in 1519, the youthful sovereign of Spain\r\nand the Netherlands came into possession of the Austrian dominions;\r\nand the electors, shortly after, chose him emperor of Germany.\r\n\r\nHe was born at Ghent, A. D. 1500, and was educated with great care. He\r\nearly displayed his love of government, and, at fifteen, was present\r\nat the deliberations of the cabinet. But he had no taste for learning,\r\nand gave but few marks of that genius which he afterwards evinced. He\r\nwas much attached to his Flemish subjects, and, during the first year\r\nof his reign, gave great offence to the grandees of Spain and the\r\nnobles of Germany by his marked partiality for those men who had been\r\nhis early companions.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to trace, in the career of Charles\xc2\xa0V., any powerful\r\nmotives of conduct, separate from the desire of aggrandizement. The\r\ninterests of the church, with which he was identified, and the true\r\nwelfare of his subjects, were, at different times, sacrificed to his\r\nambition. Had there been no powerful monarchs on the other thrones of\r\nEurope, his dreams of power might possibly have been realized. But at\r\nthis period there happened to be a constellation of princes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wars between Charles and Francis.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest of these, and the chief rival through life of Charles,\r\nwas Francis\xc2\xa0I. of France. He had even anticipated an election to the\r\nimperial crown, which would have made him more powerful than even\r\nCharles himself. The electors feared both, and chose Frederic of\r\nSaxony; but he declined the dangerous post. Charles, as Archduke of\r\nAustria, had such great and obvious claims, that they could not be\r\ndisregarded. He was therefore the fortunate candidate. But his\r\nelection was a great disappointment to Francis, and he could not\r\nconceal his mortification. Peace could not long subsist between two\r\nenvious and ambitious princes. Francis was nearly of the same age as\r\nCharles, had inherited nearly despotic power, was free from financial\r\nembarrassments, and ruled over an united and loyal people. He was\r\ntherefore no contemptible match for Charles. In addition, he\r\nstrengthened himself by alliances with the Swiss and Venetians.\r\nCharles sought the favor of the pope and Henry\xc2\xa0VIII. of England. The\r\nreal causes of war were mutual jealousies, and passion for military\r\nglory. The assigned causes were, that Charles did not respect the\r\nclaims of Francis as king of Naples; and, on the other hand, that\r\nFrancis had seized the duchy of Milan, which was a fief of the empire,\r\nand also retained the duchy of Burgundy, the patrimonial inheritance\r\nof the emperor.\r\n\r\nThe political history of Europe, for nearly half a century, is a\r\nrecord of the wars between these powerful princes, of their mutual\r\ndisasters, disappointments, and successes. Other contests were\r\ninvolved in these, and there were also some which arose from causes\r\nindependent of mutual jealousy, such as the revolt of the Spanish\r\ngrandees, of the peasants in Germany, and of the invasion of the\r\nempire by the Turks. During the reign of Charles, was also the\r\ndivision of the princes of Germany, on grounds of religion--the\r\nfoundation of the contest which, after the death of Charles, convulsed\r\nGermany for thirty years. But the Thirty Years\' War was a religious\r\nwar--was one of the political consequences of the Reformation. The\r\nwars between Charles and Francis were purely wars of military\r\nambition. Charles had greater territories and larger armies; but\r\nFrancis had more money, and more absolute control over his forces.\r\nCharles\'s power was checked in Spain by the free spirit of the Cortes,\r\nand in Germany by the independence of the princes, and by the\r\nembarrassing questions which arose out of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to read the various wars between Charles and his\r\nrival. Each of them gained, at different times, great successes, and\r\neach experienced, in turn, the most humiliating reverses. Francis was\r\neven taken prisoner at the battle of Pavia, in 1525, and confined in a\r\nfortress at Madrid, until he promised to the victors the complete\r\ndismemberment of France--an extorted promise he never meant to keep.\r\nNo sooner had he recovered his liberty, than he violated all his\r\noaths, and Europe was again the scene of fresh hostilities. The\r\npassion of revenge was now added to that of ambition, and, as the pope\r\nhad favored the cause of Francis, the generals of Charles invaded\r\nItaly. Rome was taken and sacked by the constable Bourbon, a French\r\nnoble whom Francis had slighted, and cruelties and outrages were\r\nperpetrated by the imperial forces which never disgraced Alaric or\r\nAttila.\r\n\r\nCharles affected to be filled with grief in view of the victories of\r\nhis generals, and pretended that they acted without his orders. He\r\nemployed every artifice to deceive indignant Christendom, and\r\nappointed prayers and processions throughout Spain for the recovery of\r\nthe pope\'s liberty, which one stroke of his pen could have secured.\r\nThus it was, that the most Catholic and bigoted prince in Europe\r\nseized the pope\'s person, and sacked his city, at the very time when\r\nLuther was prosecuting his reform. And this fact shows how much more\r\npowerfully the emperor was influenced by political, than by religious\r\nconsiderations. It also shows the providence of God in permitting the\r\nonly men, who could have arrested the reformation, to spend their\r\nstrength in battling each other, rather than the heresy which they\r\ndeplored. Had Charles been less powerful and ambitious, he probably\r\nwould have contented himself in punishing heretics, and in uniting\r\nwith his natural ally, the pope, in suppressing every insurrection\r\nwhich had for its object the rights of conscience and the enjoyment of\r\npopular liberty.\r\n\r\nThe war was continued for two years longer between Francis and\r\nCharles, with great acrimony, but with various success, both parties\r\nbeing, at one time, strengthened by alliances, and then again weakened\r\nby desertions. At last, both parties were exhausted, and were willing\r\nto accede to terms which they had previously rejected with disdain.\r\nFrancis was the most weakened and disheartened, but Charles was the\r\nmost perplexed. The troubles growing out of the Reformation demanded\r\nhis attention, and the Turks, at this period a powerful nation, were\r\nabout invading Austria. The Spaniards murmured at the unusual length\r\nof the war, and money was with difficulty obtained.\r\n\r\nHence the peace of Cambray, August 5, 1529; which was very\r\nadvantageous to Charles, in consequence of the impulsive character of\r\nFrancis, and his impatience to recover his children, whom he had\r\nsurrendered to Charles in order to recover his liberty. He agreed to\r\npay two millions of crowns for the ransom of his sons, and renounce\r\nhis pretensions in the Low Countries and Italy. He, moreover, lost\r\nreputation, and the confidence of Europe, by the abandonment of his\r\nallies. Charles remained the arbiter of Italy, and was attentive to\r\nthe interests of all who adhered to him. With less _chivalry_ than his\r\nrival, he had infinitely more _honor_. Cold, sagacious, selfish, and\r\nambitious, he was, however, just, and kept his word. He combined\r\nqualities we often see in selfish men--a sort of legal and technical\r\nregard to the letter of the law, with the constant violation of its\r\nspirit. A Shylock might not enter a false charge upon his books, while\r\nhe would adhere to a most extortionate bargain.\r\n\r\nCharles, after the treaty of Cambray was signed, visited Italy with\r\nall the pomp of a conqueror. At Genoa, he honored Doria with many\r\nmarks of distinction, and bestowed upon the republic new privileges.\r\nHe settled all his difficulties with Milan, Venice, and Florence, and\r\nre\xc3\xabstablished the authority of the Medici. He was then crowned by the\r\npope, whom he had trampled on, as King of Lombardy and Emperor of the\r\nRomans, and hastened into Germany, which imperatively required his\r\npresence, both on account of dissensions among the princes, which the\r\nreformation caused, and the invasion of Austria by three hundred\r\nthousand Turks. He resolved to recover the old prerogatives of the\r\nemperor of Germany, and crush those opinions which were undermining\r\nhis authority, as well as the power of Rome, with which his own was\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diet of Spires.]\r\n\r\nA Diet of the empire was accordingly summoned at Spires, in order to\r\ntake into consideration the state of religion, the main cause of all\r\nthe disturbances in Germany. It met on the 15th of March, 1529, and\r\nthe greatest address was required to prevent a civil war. All that\r\nCharles could obtain from the assembled princes was, the promise to\r\nprevent any further innovations. A decree to that effect was passed,\r\nagainst which, however, the followers of Luther protested, the most\r\npowerful of whom were the Elector of Saxony, the Marquis of\r\nBrandenburg, the Landgrave of Hesse, the Duke of Lunenburg, the Prince\r\nof Anhalt, and the deputies of fourteen imperial cities. This protest\r\ngave to them the name of _Protestants_--a name ever since retained.\r\nSoon after, the diet assembled at Augsburg, when the articles of faith\r\namong the Protestants were read,--known as the Confession of\r\nAugsburg,--which, however, the emperor opposed. In consequence of his\r\ndecree, the Protestant princes entered into a league at Smalcalde,\r\n(December 22, 1530,) to support one another, and defend their\r\nreligion. Circumstances continually occurred to convince Charles, that\r\nthe extirpation of heresy by the sword was impossible in Germany, and\r\nmoreover, he saw it was for his interest--to which his eye was\r\npeculiarly open--to unite all the German provinces in a vigorous\r\nconfederation. Accordingly after many difficulties, and with great\r\nreluctance, terms of pacification were agreed upon at Nuremburg,\r\n(1531,) and ratified in the diet at Ratisbon, shortly after, by which\r\nit was agreed that no person should be molested in his religion, and\r\nthat the Protestants, on their part, should assist the emperor in\r\nresisting the invasion of the Turks. The Germans, with their customary\r\ngood faith, furnished all the assistance they promised, and one of the\r\nbest armies ever raised in Germany, amounting to ninety thousand foot,\r\nand thirty thousand horse, took the field, commanded by the emperor in\r\nperson. But the campaign ended without any memorable event, both\r\nparties having erred from excessive caution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hostilities between Charles and Francis.]\r\n\r\nFrancis soon availed himself of the difficulties and dangers of his\r\nrival, formed an alliance with the Turks, put forth his old claims,\r\ncourted the favor of the German Protestants, and renewed hostilities.\r\nHe marched towards Italy, and took possession of the dominions of the\r\nduke of Savoy, whom the emperor, at this juncture, was unable to\r\nassist, on account of his African expedition against the pirate\r\nBarbarossa. This noted corsair had built up a great power in Tunis and\r\nAlgiers, and committed shameful ravages on all Christian nations.\r\nCharles landed in Africa with thirty thousand men, took the fortress\r\nof Goletta, defeated the pirate\'s army, captured his capital, and\r\nrestored the exiled Moorish king to his throne. In the midst of these\r\nvictories Francis invaded Savoy. Charles was terribly indignant, and\r\nloaded his rival with such violent invectives that Francis challenged\r\nhim to single combat. The challenge was accepted, but the duel was\r\nnever fought. Charles, in his turn, invaded France, with a large army,\r\nfor that age--forty thousand foot and ten thousand horse; but the\r\nexpedition was unfortunate. Francis acted on the defensive with\r\nadmirable skill, and was fortunate in his general Montmorency, who\r\nseemed possessed with the spirit of a Fabius. The emperor, at last,\r\nwas compelled to return ingloriously, having lost half of his army\r\nwithout having gained a single important advantage. The joy of\r\nFrancis, however, was embittered by the death of the dauphin,\r\nattributed by some to the infamous Catharine de Medicis, wife of the\r\nDuke of Orleans, in order to secure the crown to her husband. War did\r\nnot end with the retreat of Charles, but was continued, with great\r\npersonal animosity, until mutual exhaustion led to a truce for ten\r\nyears, concluded at Nice, in 1538. Both parties had exerted their\r\nutmost strength, and neither had obtained any signal advantage.\r\nNotwithstanding their open and secret enmity, they had an interview\r\nshortly after the truce, in which both vied with each other in\r\nexpressions of esteem and friendship, and in the exhibition of\r\nchivalrous courtesies--a miserable mockery, as shown by the violation\r\nof the terms of the truce, and the renewal of hostilities in 1541.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: African Wars.]\r\n\r\nThese were, doubtless, facilitated by Charles\'s unfortunate expedition\r\nagainst Algiers in 1541, by which he gained nothing but disgrace. His\r\narmy was wasted by famine and disease, and a tempest destroyed his\r\nfleet. All the complicated miseries which war produces were endured by\r\nhis unfortunate troops, but a small portion of whom ever returned.\r\nFrancis, taking advantage of these misfortunes, made immense military\r\npreparations, formed a league with the Sultan Solyman, and brought\r\nfive armies into the field. He assumed the offensive, and invaded the\r\nNetherlands, but obtained no laurels. Charles formed a league with\r\nHenry\xc2\xa0VIII., and the war raged, with various success, without either\r\nparty obtaining any signal advantage, for three years, when a peace\r\nwas concluded at Crespy, in 1544. Charles, being in the heart of\r\nFrance with an invading army, had the apparent advantage but the\r\ndifficulty of retreating out of France in case of disaster, and the\r\ntroubles in Germany, forced him to suspend his military operations.\r\nThe pope, also, was offended because he had conceded so much to the\r\nProtestants, and the Turks pressed him on the side of Hungary.\r\nMoreover, he was afflicted with the gout, which indisposed him for\r\ncomplicated enterprises. In view of these things, he made peace with\r\nFrancis, formed a strong alliance with the pope, and resolved to\r\nextirpate the Protestant religion, which was the cause of so many\r\ninsurrections in Germany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Council of Trent.]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the pope resolved to assemble the famous Council of\r\nTrent, the legality of which the Protestants denied. It met in\r\nDecember, 1545, and was the last general council which the popes ever\r\nassembled. It met with a view of healing the dissensions of the\r\nchurch, and confirming the authority of the pope. The princes of\r\nEurope hoped that important reforms would have been made; but nothing\r\nof consequence was done, and the attention of the divines was directed\r\nto dogmas rather than morals. The great number of Italian bishops\r\nenabled the pope to have every thing his own way, in spite of the\r\nremonstrance of the German, Spanish, and French prelates, and the\r\nambassadors of the different monarchs, who also had seats in the\r\ncouncil. The decrees of this council, respecting articles of faith,\r\nare considered as a final authority by the Roman church. It denounced\r\nthe reform of Luther, and confirmed the various ecclesiastical\r\nusurpations which had rendered the reformation necessary. It lasted\r\ntwenty-two years, at different intervals, during the pontificate of\r\nfive popes. The Jesuits, just rising into notice, had considerable\r\ninfluence in the council, in consequence of the learning and ability\r\nof their representatives, and especially of Laynez, the general of the\r\norder. The Dominicans and Franciscans manifested their accustomed\r\nanimosities and rivalries, and questions were continually proposed and\r\nagitated, which divided the assembly. The French bishops, headed by\r\nthe Cardinal of Lorraine, were opposed to the high pretensions of the\r\nItalians, especially of Cardinal Morone, the papal legate; but, by\r\nartifice and management, the more strenuous adherents of the pope\r\nattained their ends.\r\n\r\nAbout the time the council assembled, died three distinguished\r\npersons--Henry\xc2\xa0VIII. of England, Francis\xc2\xa0I., and Luther. Charles\xc2\xa0V.\r\nwas freed from his great rival, and from the only private person in\r\nhis dominions he had reason to fear. He now, in good earnest, turned\r\nhis attention to the internal state of his empire, and resolved to\r\ncrush the Reformation, and, by force, if it were necessary. He\r\ncommenced by endeavoring to amuse and deceive the Protestants, and\r\nevinced that profound dissimulation, which was one of his\r\ncharacteristics. He formed a strict alliance with the pope, made a\r\ntruce with Solyman, and won over to his side Maurice and other German\r\nprinces. His military preparations and his intrigues alarmed the\r\nProtestants, and they prepared themselves for resistance. Religious\r\nzeal seconded their military ardor. One of the largest armies, which\r\nhad been raised in Europe for a century, took the field, and Charles,\r\nshut up in Ratisbon, was in no condition to fight. Unfortunately for\r\nthe Protestants, they negotiated instead of acting. The emperor was in\r\ntheir power, but he was one of those few persons who remained haughty\r\nand inflexible in the midst of calamities. He pronounced the ban of\r\nthe empire against the Protestant princes, who were no match for a man\r\nwho had spent his life in the field: they acted without concert, and\r\ncommitted many errors. Their forces decreased, while those of the\r\nemperor increased by large additions from Italy and Flanders. Instead\r\nof decisive action, the Protestants dallied and procrastinated,\r\nunwilling to make peace, and unwilling to face their sovereign. Their\r\narmy melted away, and nothing of importance was effected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treachery of Maurice.]\r\n\r\nMaurice, cousin to the Elector of Saxony, with a baseness to which\r\nhistory scarcely affords a parallel, deserted his allies, and joined\r\nthe emperor, purely from ambitious motives, and invaded the\r\nterritories of his kinsman with twelve thousand men. The confederates\r\nmade overtures of peace, which being rejected, they separated, and\r\nmost of them submitted to the emperor. He treated them with\r\nhaughtiness and rigor, imposed on them most humiliating terms, forced\r\nthem to renounce the league of Smalcalde, to give up their military\r\nstores, to admit garrisons into their cities, and to pay large\r\ncontributions in money.\r\n\r\nThe Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse, however held out;\r\nand such was the condition of the emperor, that he could not\r\nimmediately attack them. But the death of Francis gave him leisure to\r\ninvade Saxony, and the elector was defeated at the battle of\r\nMuhlhausen, (1547,) and taken prisoner. The captive prince approached\r\nthe victor without sullenness or pride. "The fortune of war," said he,\r\n"has made me your prisoner, most gracious emperor, and I hope to be\r\ntreated ----" Here Charles interrupted him--"And am I, at last,\r\nacknowledged to be emperor? Charles of Ghent was the only title you\r\nlately allowed me. You shall be treated as you deserve." At these\r\nwords he turned his back upon him with a haughty air.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Captivity of the Landgrave of Hesse.]\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate prince was closely guarded by Spanish soldiers, and\r\nbrought to a trial before a court martial, at which presided the\r\ninfamous Duke of Alva, afterwards celebrated for his cruelties in\r\nHolland. He was convicted of treason and rebellion, and sentenced to\r\ndeath--a sentence which no court martial had a right to inflict on the\r\nfirst prince of the empire. He was treated with ignominious harshness,\r\nwhich he bore with great magnanimity, but finally made a treaty with\r\nthe emperor, by which, for the preservation of his life, he\r\nrelinquished his kingdom to Maurice.\r\n\r\nThe landgrave was not strong enough to resist the power of Charles,\r\nafter all his enemies were subdued, and he made his submission, though\r\nCharles extorted the most rigorous conditions, he being required to\r\nsurrender his person, abandon the league of Smalcalde, implore pardon\r\non his knees, demolish his fortifications, and pay an enormous fine.\r\nIn short, it was an unconditional submission. Beside infinite\r\nmortifications, he was detained a prisoner, which, on Charles\'s part,\r\nwas but injury added to insult--an act of fraud and injustice which\r\ninspired the prince, and the Protestants, generally, with unbounded\r\nindignation. The Elector of Brandenburg and Maurice in vain solicited\r\nfor his liberty, and showed the infamy to which he would be exposed if\r\nhe detained the landgrave a prisoner. But the emperor listened to\r\ntheir remonstrances with the most provoking coolness, and showed very\r\nplainly that he was resolved to crush all rebellion, suppress\r\nProtestantism, and raise up an absolute throne in Germany, to the\r\nsubversion of its ancient constitution.\r\n\r\nTo all appearances, his triumph was complete. His great rival was\r\ndead; his enemies were subdued and humiliated; Luther\'s voice was\r\nhushed; and immense contributions filled the imperial treasury. He now\r\nbegan to realize the dreams of his life. He was unquestionably, at\r\nthat time, the most absolute and powerful prince Europe has ever seen\r\nsince Charlemagne, with the exception of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nBut what an impressive moral does the history of human greatness\r\nconvey! The hour of triumph is often but the harbinger of defeat and\r\nshame. "Pride goeth before destruction." Charles\xc2\xa0V., with all his\r\npolicy and experience, overreached himself. The failure of his\r\nambitious projects and the restoration of Protestantism, were brought\r\nabout by instruments the least anticipated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Heroism of Maurice..]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Misfortunes of Charles..]\r\n\r\nThe cause of Protestantism and the liberties of Germany were\r\nendangered by the treachery of Maurice, who received, as his reward,\r\nthe great electorate of Saxony. He had climbed to the summit of glory\r\nand power. Who would suppose that this traitor prince would desert the\r\nemperor, who had so splendidly rewarded his services, and return to\r\nthe rescue of those princes whom he had so basely betrayed? But who\r\ncan thread the labyrinth of an intriguing and selfish heart? Who can\r\ncalculate the movements of an unprincipled and restless politician?\r\nMaurice, at length, awoke to the perception of the real condition of\r\nhis country. He saw its liberties being overturned by the most\r\nambitious man whom ten centuries had produced. He saw the cause, which\r\nhis convictions told him was the true one, in danger of being wrecked.\r\nHe was, moreover, wounded by the pride, coldness, and undisguised\r\nselfishness of the emperor. He was indignant that the landgrave, his\r\nfather-in-law, should be retained a prisoner, against all the laws of\r\nhonor and of justice. He resolved to come to the rescue of his\r\ncountry. He formed his plans with the greatest coolness, and exercised\r\na power of dissimulation that has no parallel in history. But his\r\naddress was even greater than his hypocrisy. He gained the confidence\r\nof the Protestants, without losing that of the emperor. He even\r\nobtained the command of an army which Charles sent to reduce the\r\nrebellious city of Magdeburg, and, while he was besieging the city, he\r\nwas negotiating with the generals who defended it for a general union\r\nagainst the emperor. Magdeburg surrendered in 1551. Its chieftains\r\nwere secretly assured that the terms of capitulation should not be\r\nobserved. His next point was, to keep the army together until his\r\nschemes were ripened, and then to arrest the emperor, whose thoughts\r\nnow centred on the council of Trent. So he proposed sending Protestant\r\ndivines to the council, but delayed their departure by endless\r\nnegotiations about the terms of a safe conduct. He, moreover, formed a\r\nsecret treaty with Henry\xc2\xa0II., the successor of Francis, whose\r\nanimosity against Charles was as intense as was that of his father.\r\nWhen his preparations were completed, he joined his army in Thuringia,\r\nand took the field against the emperor, who had no suspicion of his\r\ndesigns, and who blindly trusted to him, deeming it impossible that a\r\nman, whom he had so honored and rewarded, could turn against him.\r\nMarch 18, 1552, Maurice published his manifesto, justifying his\r\nconduct; and his reasons were, to secure the Protestant religion, to\r\nmaintain the constitution of the empire, and deliver the Landgrave of\r\nHesse from bondage. He was powerfully supported by the French king,\r\nand, with a rapidly increasing army, marched towards Innspruck, where\r\nthe emperor was quartered. The emperor was thunderstruck when he heard\r\nthe tidings of his desertion, and was in no condition to resist him.\r\nHe endeavored to gain time by negotiations, but these were without\r\neffect. Maurice, at the head of a large army, advanced rapidly into\r\nUpper Germany. Castles and cities surrendered as he advanced, and so\r\nrapid was his progress, that he came near taking the emperor captive.\r\nCharles was obliged to fly, in the middle of the night, and to travel\r\non a litter by torchlight, amid the passes of the Alps. He scarcely\r\nleft Innspruck before Maurice entered it--but too late to gain the\r\nprize he sought. The emperor rallied his armies, and a vigorous war\r\nwas carried on between the contending parties, to the advantage of the\r\nProtestants. The emperor, after a while, was obliged to make peace\r\nwith them, for his Spanish subjects were disgusted with the war, his\r\nfunds were exhausted, his forces dispersed, and his territories\r\nthreatened by the French. On the 2d of August, 1552, was concluded the\r\npeace of Passau, which secured the return of the landgrave to his\r\ndominions, the freedom of religion to the Protestants, and the\r\npreservation of the German constitution. The sanguine hopes of the\r\nemperor were dispelled, and all his ambitious schemes defeated, and he\r\nleft to meditate, in the intervals of the pains which he suffered from\r\nthe gout, on the instability of all greatness, and the vanity of human\r\nlife. Maurice was now extolled as extravagantly as he had been before\r\ndenounced, and his treachery justified, even by grave divines. But\r\nwhat is most singular in the whole affair, was, that the French king,\r\nwhile persecuting Protestants at home, should protect them abroad. But\r\nthis conduct may confirm, in a signal manner, the great truth of\r\nhistory, that God regulates the caprice of human passions, and makes\r\nthem subservient to the accomplishment of his own purposes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Passau.]\r\n\r\nThe labors and perplexities of Charles\xc2\xa0V. were not diminished by the\r\ntreaty of Passau. He continued his hostilities against the French and\r\nagainst the Turks. He was obliged to raise the siege of Metz, which\r\nwas gallantly defended by the Duke of Guise. To his calamities in\r\nFrance, were added others in Italy. Sienna revolted against his\r\ngovernment, and Naples was threatened by the Turks. The imperialists\r\nwere unsuccessful in Italy and in Hungary, and the Archduke Ferdinand\r\nwas obliged to abandon Transylvania. But war was carried on in the Low\r\nCountries with considerable vigor.\r\n\r\nCharles, whose only passion was the aggrandizement of his house, now\r\nprojected a marriage of his son, Philip, with Mary, queen of England.\r\nThe queen, dazzled by the prospect of marrying the heir of the\r\ngreatest monarch in Europe, and eager to secure his powerful aid to\r\nre\xc3\xabstablish Catholicism in England, listened to his proposal, although\r\nit was disliked by the nation. In spite of the remonstrance of the\r\nhouse of commons, the marriage treaty was concluded, and the marriage\r\ncelebrated, (1554.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Charles\xc2\xa0V.]\r\n\r\nSoon after, Charles formed the extraordinary resolution of resigning\r\nhis dominions to his son, and of retiring to a quiet retreat.\r\nDiocletian is the only instance of a prince, capable of holding the\r\nreins of government, who had adopted a similar course. All Europe was\r\nastonished at the resolution of Charles, and all historians of the\r\nperiod have moralized on the event. But it ceases to be mysterious,\r\nwhen we remember that Charles was no nearer the accomplishment of the\r\nends which animated his existence, than he was thirty years before;\r\nthat he was disgusted and wearied with the world; that he suffered\r\nseverely from the gout, which, at times, incapacitated him for the\r\ngovernment of his extensive dominions. It was never his habit to\r\nintrust others with duties and labors which he could perform himself,\r\nand he felt that his empire needed a more powerful protector than his\r\ninfirmities permitted him to be. He was grown prematurely old, he felt\r\nhis declining health; longed for repose, and sought religious\r\nconsolation. Of all his vast possessions, he only reserved an annual\r\npension of one hundred thousand crowns; resigning Spain and the Low\r\nCountries into the hands of Philip, and the empire of Germany to his\r\nbrother Ferdinand, who had already been elected as King of the Romans.\r\nHe then set out for his retreat in Spain, which was the monastery of\r\nSt. Justus, near Placentia, situated in a lovely vale, surrounded with\r\nlofty trees, watered by a small brook, and rendered attractive by the\r\nfertility of the soil, and the delightful temperature of the climate.\r\nHere he spent his last days in agricultural improvements and religious\r\nexercises, apparently regardless of that noisy world which he had\r\ndeserted forever, and indifferent to those political storms which his\r\nrestless ambition had raised. Here his grandeur and his worldly hopes\r\nwere buried in preparing himself for the future world. He lived with\r\ngreat simplicity, for two years after his retreat, and died (1558,)\r\nfrom the effects of the gout, which, added to his great labors, had\r\nshattered his constitution. He was not what the world would call a\r\ngreat genius, like Napoleon; but he was a man of great sagacity,\r\nuntiring industry, and respectable attainments. He was cautious, cold,\r\nand selfish; had but little faith in human virtue, and was a slave, in\r\nhis latter days, to superstition. He was neither affable nor\r\ncourteous, but was sincere in his attachments, and munificent in\r\nrewarding his generals and friends. He was not envious nor cruel, but\r\ninordinately ambitious, and intent on aggrandizing his family. This\r\nwas his characteristic defect, and this, in a man so prominent and so\r\nfavored by circumstances, was enough to keep Europe in a turmoil for\r\nnearly half a century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Robertson\'s History of Charles\xc2\xa0V.

The monotonous, and\r\nalmost exclusive, record of royal pleasures and pursuits shows in how\r\nlittle consideration the people were held. They struggled, and toiled,\r\nand murmured as they do now. They probably had the same joys and\r\nsorrows as in our times. But, in these times, they have considerable\r\ninfluence on the government, the religion, the literature, and the\r\nsocial life of nations. In the sixteenth century, this influence was\r\nnot so apparent; but power of all kinds seemed to emanate from kings\r\nand nobles; at least from wealthy and cultivated classes. When this is\r\nthe case, when kings give a law to society, history is not\r\nunphilosophical which recognizes chiefly their enterprises and ideas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of Absolute Monarchy.]\r\n\r\nThe rise of absolute monarchy on the ruins of feudal states is one of\r\nthe chief features of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. There was\r\nevery where a strong tendency to centralization. Provinces, before\r\nindependent, were controlled by a central government. Standing armies\r\ntook the place of feudal armies. Kings took away from nobles the right\r\nto coin money, administer justice, and impose taxes. The power of the\r\ncrown became supreme and unlimited.\r\n\r\nBut some monarchs were more independent than others, in proportion as\r\nthe power of nobles was suppressed, or, as the cities sided with the\r\ncentral government, or, as provinces were connected and bound\r\ntogether. The power of Charles\xc2\xa0V. was somewhat limited, in Spain, by\r\nthe free spirit of the Cortes, and, in Germany, by the independence of\r\nthe princes of the empire. But, in France and England, the king was\r\nmore absolute, although he did not rule over so great extent of\r\nterritory as did the emperor of Germany; and this is one reason why\r\nFrancis\xc2\xa0I. proved so strong an antagonist to his more powerful rival.\r\n\r\nThe history of France, during the reign of this monarch, is also the\r\nhistory of Charles\xc2\xa0V., since they were both engaged in the same wars;\r\nwhich wars have already been alluded to. Both of these monarchs failed\r\nin the objects of their existence. If Charles did not realize his\r\ndream of universal empire, neither did Francis leave his kingdom, at\r\nhis death, in a more prosperous state than he found it.\r\n\r\nFrancis\xc2\xa0I. was succeeded by his son Henry\xc2\xa0II., a warlike prince, but\r\ndestitute of prudence, and under the control of women. His policy,\r\nhowever, was substantially that of his father, and he continued\r\nhostilities against the emperor of Germany, till his resignation. He\r\nwas a bitter persecutor of the Protestants, and the seeds of\r\nsubsequent civil wars were sown by his zeal. He was removed from his\r\nthrone prematurely, being killed at a tournament, in 1559, soon after\r\nthe death of Charles\xc2\xa0V. Tournaments ceased with his death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry\xc2\xa0VIII.]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Henry\xc2\xa0VIII., the other great contemporary of Charles\xc2\xa0V.,\r\nmerits a larger notice, not only because his reign was the\r\ncommencement of a new era in England, but, also, because the affairs,\r\nwhich engaged his attention, are not much connected with continental\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nHe ascended the throne in the year 1509, in his eighteenth year,\r\nwithout opposition, and amid the universal joy of the nation; for his\r\nmanners were easy and frank, his disposition was cheerful, and his\r\nperson was handsome. He had made respectable literary attainments, and\r\nhe gave promise of considerable abilities. He was married, soon after\r\nhis accession, to Catharine, daughter of the King of Spain, and the\r\nfirst years of his reign were happy, both to himself and to his\r\nsubjects. He had a well-filled treasury, which his father had amassed\r\nwith great care, a devoted people and an obedient parliament. All\r\ncircumstances seemed to conspire to strengthen his power, and to make\r\nhim the arbiter of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut this state did not last long. The young king was resolved to make\r\nwar on France, but was diverted from his aim by troubles in Scotland,\r\ngrowing out of his own rapacity--a trait which ever peculiarly\r\ndistinguished him. These troubles resulted in a war with the Scots,\r\nwho were defeated at the memorable battle of Flodden Field, which Sir\r\nWalter Scott, in his Marmion, has immortalized. The Scotch commanders,\r\nLenox and Argyle, both perished, as well as the valiant King James\r\nhimself. There is scarcely an illustrious Scotch family who had not an\r\nancestor slain on that fatal day, September 9, 1513. But the victory\r\nwas dearly bought, and Surrey, the English general, afterwards Duke of\r\nNorfolk, was unable to pursue his advantages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of Cardinal Wolsey.]\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the celebrated Cardinal Wolsey began to act a\r\nconspicuous part in English affairs. His father was a butcher of\r\nIpswich; but was able to give his son a good education. He studied at\r\nOxford, was soon distinguished for his attainments, and became tutor\r\nto the sons of the Marquis of Dorset. The marquis gave him the rich\r\nliving of Limington; but the young parson, with his restless ambition,\r\nand love of excitement and pleasure, was soon wearied of a country\r\nlife. He left his parish to become domestic chaplain to the treasurer\r\nof Calais. This post introduced him to Fox, bishop of Winchester, who\r\nshared with the Earl of Surrey the highest favors of royalty. The\r\nminister and diplomatist, finding in the young man learning, tact,\r\nvivacity, and talent for business, introduced him to the king, hoping\r\nthat he would prove an agreeable companion for Henry, and a useful\r\ntool for himself. But those who are able to manage other people\'s\r\nbusiness, generally are able to manage their own. The tool of Fox\r\nlooked after his own interest chiefly. He supplanted his master in the\r\nloyal favor, and soon acquired more favor and influence at court than\r\nany of the ministers or favorites. Though twenty years older than\r\nHenry, he adapted himself to all his tastes, flattered his vanity and\r\npassions, and became his bosom friend. He gossiped with him about\r\nThomas Aquinas, the Indies, and affairs of gallantry. He was a great\r\nrefiner of sensual pleasures, had a passion for magnificence and\r\ndisplay, and a real genius for court entertainments. He could eat and\r\ndrink with the gayest courtiers, sing merry songs, and join in the\r\ndance. He was blunt and frank in his manners; but these only concealed\r\ncraft and cunning. "It is art to conceal art," and Wolsey was a master\r\nof all the tricks of dissimulation. He rose rapidly after he had once\r\ngained the heart of the king. He became successively dean of York,\r\npapal legate, cardinal, bishop of Lincoln, archbishop of York, and\r\nlord chancellor. He also obtained the administration and the\r\ntemporalities of the rich abbey of St. Albans, and of the bishoprics\r\nof Bath and Wells, Durham and Winchester. By these gifts, his revenues\r\nalmost equalled those of the crown; and he squandered them in a style\r\nof unparalleled extravagance. He dressed in purple and gold, supported\r\na train of eight hundred persons, and built Hampton Court. He was the\r\nchannel through which the royal favors flowed. But he made a good\r\nchancellor, dispensed justice, repressed the power of the nobles,\r\nencouraged and rewarded literary men, and endowed colleges. He was the\r\nmost magnificent and the most powerful subject that England has ever\r\nseen. Even nobles were proud to join his train of dependants. There\r\nwas nothing sordid or vulgar, however, in all his ostentation. Henry\r\ntook pleasure in his pomp, for it was a reflection of the greatness of\r\nhis own majesty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magnificence of Henry\xc2\xa0VIII.]\r\n\r\nThe first years of the reign of Henry\xc2\xa0VIII., after the battle of\r\nFlodden Field, were spent in pleasure, and in great public displays of\r\nmagnificence, which charmed the people, and made him a popular idol.\r\nAmong these, the interview of the king with Francis\xc2\xa0I. is the most\r\nnoted, on the 4th of June, 1520; the most gorgeous pageant of the\r\nsixteenth century, designed by Wolsey, who had a genius for such\r\nthings. The monarchs met in a beautiful valley, where jousts and\r\ntournaments were held, and where was exhibited all the magnificence\r\nwhich the united resources of France and England could command. The\r\ninterview was sought by Francis to win, through Wolsey, the favor of\r\nthe king, and to counterbalance the advantages which it was supposed\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0V. had gained on a previous visit to the king at Dover.\r\n\r\nThe getting up of the "Field of the Cloth of Gold" created some\r\nmurmurs among the English nobility, many of whom were injured by the\r\nexpensive tastes of Wolsey. Among these was the Duke of Buckingham,\r\nhereditary high constable of England, and connected with the royal\r\nhouse of the Plantagenets. Henry, from motives of jealousy, both on\r\naccount of his birth and fortune, had long singled him out as his\r\nvictim. He was, also, obnoxious to Wolsey, since he would not flatter\r\nhis pride, and he had, moreover, insulted him. It is very easy for a\r\nking to find a pretence for committing a crime; and Buckingham was\r\narrested, tried, and executed, for making traitorous prophecies. His\r\nreal crime was in being more powerful than it suited the policy of the\r\nking. With the death of Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, in 1521,\r\ncommenced the bloody cruelty of Henry\xc2\xa0VIII.\r\n\r\nSoon after the death of Buckingham, the king made himself notorious\r\nfor his theological writings against Luther, whose doctrines he\r\ndetested. He ever had a taste for theological disputation, and a love\r\nof the schoolmen. His tracts against Luther, very respectable for\r\ntalent and learning, though disgraced by coarse and vulgar\r\nvituperation, secured for him the favor of the pope, who bestowed upon\r\nhim the title of "Defender of the Faith;" and a strong alliance\r\nexisted between them until the divorce of Queen Catharine.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties and delays, attending this act of cruelty and\r\ninjustice, constitute no small part of the domestic history of England\r\nduring the reign of Henry\xc2\xa0VIII. Any event, which furnishes subjects of\r\nuniversal gossip and discussion, is ever worthy of historical notice,\r\ninasmuch as it shows prevailing opinions and tastes.\r\n\r\nQueen Catharine, daughter of Ferdinand, King of Spain, was eight years\r\nolder than her husband, whom she married in the first year of his\r\nreign. She had been previously married to his brother Arthur, who died\r\nof the plague in 1502. For several years after her marriage with\r\nHenry\xc2\xa0VIII., her domestic happiness was a subject of remark; and the\r\nemperor, Charles\xc2\xa0V., congratulated her on her brilliant fortune. She\r\nwas beautiful, sincere, accomplished; religious, and disinterested,\r\nand every way calculated to secure, as she had won, the king\'s\r\naffections.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anne Boleyn.]\r\n\r\nBut among her maids of honor there was one peculiarly accomplished and\r\nfascinating, to whom the king transferred his affections with unwonted\r\nvehemence. This was Anne Boleyn, daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, who,\r\nfrom his great wealth, married Elizabeth Howard, daughter of the first\r\nduke of Norfolk. This noble alliance brought Sir Thomas Boleyn into\r\nclose connection with royalty, and led to the appointment of his\r\ndaughter to the high post which she held at the court of Queen\r\nCatharine. It is probable that the king suppressed his passion for\r\nsome time; and it would have been longer concealed, even from its\r\nobject, had not his jealousy been excited by her attachment to Percy,\r\nson of the Earl of Northumberland. The king at last made known his\r\npassion; but the daughter of the Howards was too proud, or too\r\npolitic, or too high principled, to listen to his overtures. It was\r\nonly _as queen of England_, that she would return the passion of her\r\nroyal lover. Moreover, she resolved to be revenged on the all-powerful\r\ncardinal, for assisting in her separation from Percy, whom she loved\r\nwith romantic attachment. The king waited four years, but Anne\r\nremained inflexibly virtuous. He then meditated the divorce from\r\nCatharine, as the only way to accomplish the object which now seemed\r\nto animate his existence. He confided the matter to his favorite\r\nminister; but Wolsey was thunderstruck at the disclosure, and remained\r\nwith him four hours on his knees, to dissuade him from a step which\r\nhe justly regarded as madness. Here Wolsey appears as an honest man\r\nand a true friend; but royal infatuation knows neither wisdom,\r\njustice, nor humanity. Wolsey, as a man of the world, here made a\r\nblunder, and departed from the policy he had hitherto pursued--that of\r\nflattering the humors of his absolute master. Wolsey, however,\r\nrecommended the king to consult the divines; for Henry pretended that,\r\nafter nearly twenty years of married life, he had conscientious\r\nscruples about the lawfulness of his marriage. The learned English\r\ndoctors were afraid to pronounce their opinions, and suggested a\r\nreference to the fathers. But the king was not content with their\r\nauthority; he appealed to the pope, and to the decisions of half of\r\nthe universities of Europe. It seems very singular that a sovereign so\r\nunprincipled, unscrupulous, and passionate, and yet so absolute and\r\npowerful as was Henry, should have wasted his time and money in\r\nseeking countenance to an act on which he was fully determined, and\r\nwhich countenance he never could reasonably hope to secure. But his\r\ncharacter was made up of contradictions. His caprice, violence, and\r\nwant of good faith, were strangely blended with superstition and\r\nreverence for the authority of the church. His temper urged him to the\r\nmost rigorous measure of injustice; and his injustice produced no\r\nshame, although he was restrained somewhat by the opinions of the very\r\nmen whom he did not hesitate to murder.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Queen Catharine.]\r\n\r\nQueen Catharine, besides being a virtuous and excellent woman, was\r\npowerfully allied, and was a zealous Catholic. Her repudiation,\r\ntherefore, could not take place without offending the very persons\r\nwhose favor the king was most anxious to conciliate especially the\r\nEmperor Charles, her nephew, and the pope, and all the high\r\ndignitaries and adherents of the church. Even Wolsey could not in\r\nhonor favor the divorce, although it was his policy to do so. In\r\nconsequence of his intrigues, and the scandal and offence so\r\noutrageous an act as the divorce of Catharine must necessarily produce\r\nthroughout the civilized world, Henry long delayed to bring the matter\r\nto a crisis, being afraid of a war with Charles\xc2\xa0V., and of the\r\nanathemas of the pope. Moreover, he hoped to gain him over, for the\r\npope had sent Cardinal Campeggio to London, to hold, with his legate\r\nWolsey, a court to hear the case. But it was the farthest from his\r\nintention to grant the divorce, for the pope was more afraid of\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0V. than he was of Henry\xc2\xa0VIII.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disgrace and Death of Wolsey.]\r\n\r\nThe court settled nothing, and the king\'s wrath now turned towards\r\nWolsey, whom he suspected of secretly thwarting his measures. The\r\naccomplished courtier, so long accustomed to the smiles and favors of\r\nroyalty, could not bear his disgrace with dignity. The proudest man in\r\nEngland became, all at once, the meanest. He wept, he cringed, he lost\r\nhis spirits; he surrendered his palace, his treasures, his honors, and\r\nhis offices, into the hands of him who gave them to him, without a\r\nsingle expostulation: wrote most abject letters to "his most gracious,\r\nmost merciful, and most pious sovereign lord;" and died of a broken\r\nheart on his way to a prison and the scaffold. "Had I but served my\r\nGod as diligently as I have served the king, he would not have given\r\nme over in my gray hairs"--these were the words of the dying cardinal;\r\nhis sad confessions on experiencing the vanity of human life. But the\r\nvindictive prince suffered no word of sorrow or regret to escape him,\r\nwhen he heard of the death of his prime minister, and his intimate\r\nfriend for twenty years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More--Cranmer--Cromwell.]\r\n\r\nShortly after the disgrace of Wolsey, which happened nearly a year\r\nbefore his death, (1529,) three remarkable men began to figure in\r\nEnglish politics and history. These were Sir Thomas More, Thomas\r\nCranmer, and Thomas Cromwell. More was the most accomplished, most\r\nlearned, and most enlightened of the three. He was a Catholic, but\r\nvery exemplary in his life, and charitable in his views. In moral\r\nelevation of character, and beautiful serenity of soul, the annals of\r\nthe great men of his country furnish no superior. His extensive\r\nerudition and moral integrity alone secured him the official station\r\nwhich Wolsey held as lord chancellor. He was always the intimate\r\nfriend of the king, and his conversation, so enlivened by wit, and so\r\nrich and varied in matter, caused his society to be universally\r\nsought. He discharged his duties with singular conscientiousness and\r\nability; and no one ever had cause to complain that justice was not\r\nrendered him.\r\n\r\nCranmer\'s elevation was owing to a fortunate circumstance,\r\nnotwithstanding his exalted merit. He happened to say, while tutor to\r\na gentleman of the name of Cressy, in the hearing of Dr. Gardiner,\r\nthen secretary to Henry, that the proper way to settle the difficulty\r\nabout the divorce was, to appeal to learned men, who would settle the\r\nmatter on the sole authority of the Bible, without reference to the\r\npope. This remark was reported to the king, and Cranmer was sent to\r\nreside with the father of Anne Boleyn, and was employed in writing a\r\ntreatise to support his opinion. His ability led to further honors,\r\nuntil, on the death of Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, he was\r\nappointed to the vacant see, the first office in dignity and\r\nimportance in the kingdom, and from which no king, however absolute,\r\ncould eject him, except by the loss of life. We shall see that, in all\r\nmatters of religion, Cranmer was the ruling spirit in England until\r\nthe accession of Mary.\r\n\r\nCromwell\'s origin was even more obscure than that of Wolsey\'s; but he\r\nreceived his education at one of the universities. We first hear of\r\nhim as a clerk in an English factory at Antwerp, then as a soldier in\r\nthe army of the Constable Bourbon when it sacked Rome, then as a clerk\r\nin a mercantile house in Venice, and then again as a lawyer in\r\nEngland, where he attracted the attention of Wolsey, who made him his\r\nsolicitor, and employed him in the dissolution of monasteries. He then\r\nbecame a member of the house of commons, where his address and\r\nbusiness talents were conspicuous. He was well received at court, and\r\nconfirmed in the stewardship of the monasteries, after the disgrace of\r\nhis master. His office brought him often into personal conference with\r\nthe king; and, at one of these, he recommended him to deny the\r\nauthority of the pope altogether, and declare himself supreme head of\r\nthe church. The boldness of this advice was congenial to the temper of\r\nthe king, worried by the opposition of Rome to his intended divorce,\r\nand Cromwell became a member of the privy council. His fortune was\r\nthus made by his seasonable advice. All who opposed the king were sure\r\nto fall, and all who favored him were sure to rise, as must ever be\r\nthe case in an absolute monarchy, where the king is the centre and the\r\nfountain of all honor and dignity.\r\n\r\nWith such ministers as Cranmer and Cromwell, the measures of Henry\r\nwere now prompt and bold. Queen Catharine was soon disposed of; she\r\nwas divorced and disgraced, and Anne Boleyn was elevated to her\r\nthrone, (1533.) The anathemas of the pope and the outcry of all Europe\r\nfollowed. Sir Thomas More resigned the seals, and retired to poverty\r\nand solitude. But he was not permitted to enjoy his retirement long.\r\nRefusing to take the oath of supremacy to Henry, as head of the church\r\nas well as of the state, he was executed, with other illustrious\r\nCatholics. The execution of More was the most cruel and uncalled-for\r\nact of the whole reign, and entailed on its author the execrations of\r\nall the learned and virtuous men in Europe, most of whom appreciated\r\nthe transcendent excellences of the murdered chancellor, the author of\r\nthe Utopia, and the Boethius of his age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quarrel with the Pope.]\r\n\r\nThe fulminations of the pope only excited Henry to more decided\r\nopposition. The parliament, controlled by Cromwell, acknowledged him\r\nas the supreme head of the Church of England, and the separation from\r\nRome was final and irrevocable. The tenths were annexed to the crown,\r\nand the bishops took a new oath of supremacy.\r\n\r\nThe independence of the Church of England, effected in 1535, was\r\nfollowed by important consequences, and was the first step to the\r\nreformation, afterwards perfected by Edward\xc2\xa0VI. But as the first acts\r\nof the reformation were prompted by political considerations, the\r\nreformers in England, during the reign of Henry\xc2\xa0VIII., should be\r\nconsidered chiefly in a political point of view. The separation from\r\nRome, during the reign of this prince, was not followed by the\r\nabolition of the Roman Catholic worship, nor any of the rites and\r\nceremonies of that church. Nor was religious toleration secured. Every\r\nthing was subservient to the royal conscience, and a secular, instead\r\nof an ecclesiastical pope, still reigned in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abolition of Monasteries.]\r\n\r\nHenry soon found that his new position, as head of the English Church,\r\nimposed new duties and cares: he therefore established a separate\r\ndepartment for the conduct of ecclesiastical affairs, over which he\r\nplaced the unscrupulous, but energetic Cromwell--a fit minister to\r\nsuch a monarch. A layman, who hated the clergy, and who looked solely\r\nto the pecuniary interests of his master, was thus placed over the\r\nhighest prelates of the church. But Cromwell, in consulting the\r\npecuniary interests of the king, also had an eye to the political\r\ninterests of the kingdom. He was a sagacious and practical man of the\r\nworld, and was disgusted with the vices of the clergy, and especially\r\nwith the custom of sending money to Rome, in the shape of annates and\r\ntaxes. This evil he remedied, which tended greatly to enrich the\r\ncountry, for the popes at this time were peculiarly extortionate. He\r\nthen turned his attention to the reform of the whole monastic\r\ninstitution, but with an eye also to its entire destruction. Cromwell\r\nhated the monks. They were lazy, ignorant, and debauched. They were a\r\ngreat burden on the people, and were as insolent and proud as they\r\nwere idle and profligate. The country swarmed with them. The roads,\r\ntaverns, and the houses of the credulous were infested with them.\r\nCranmer, who sympathized with the German reformers, hated them on\r\nreligious grounds, and readily co\xc3\xb6perated with Cromwell; while the\r\nking, whose extortion and rapacity knew no bounds, listened, with\r\nglistening eye, to the suggestions of his two favorite ministers. The\r\nnation was suddenly astounded with the intelligence that parliament\r\nhad passed a bill, giving to the king and his heirs all the monastic\r\nestablishments in the kingdom, which did not exceed two hundred pounds\r\na year. Three hundred and eighty thus fell at a blow, whereby the king\r\nwas enriched by thirty-two thousand pounds a year, and one hundred\r\nthousand pounds ready money--an immense sum in that age. By this\r\nspoliation, perhaps called for, but exceedingly unjust and harsh, and\r\nin violation of all the rights of property, thousands were reduced to\r\nbeggary and misery, while there was scarcely an eminent man in the\r\nkingdom who did not come in for a share of the plunder. Vast grants of\r\nlands were bestowed by the king on his favorites and courtiers, in\r\norder to appease the nation; and thus the foundations of many of the\r\ngreat estates of the English nobility were laid. The spoliations,\r\nhowever, led to many serious riots and insurrections, especially in\r\nLincolnshire. At one place there were forty thousand rebels under\r\narms; but they were easily suppressed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suppression of Monasteries.]\r\n\r\nThe rapacious king was not satisfied with the plunder he had secured,\r\nand, in 1539, the final suppression of all the monasteries in England\r\nwas decreed. Then followed the seizure of all the church property in\r\nEngland connected with monasteries--shrines, relics, gold and silver\r\nvessels of immense value and rarity, lands, and churches. Canterbury,\r\nBath, Merton, Stratford, Bury St. Edmonds, Glastonbury, and St.\r\nAlbans, suffered most, and many of those beautiful monuments of Gothic\r\narchitecture were levelled with the dust. Their destruction deprived\r\nthe people of many physical accommodations, for they had been\r\nhospitals and caravansaries, as well as "cages of unclean birds."\r\nNeither the church nor the universities profited much from the\r\nconfiscation of so much property, and only six new bishoprics were\r\nformed, and only fourteen abbeys were converted into cathedrals and\r\ncollegiate churches. The king and the nobles were the only gainers by\r\nthe spoil; the people obtained no advantage in that age, although they\r\nhave in succeeding ages.\r\n\r\nAfter renouncing the pope\'s supremacy, and suppressing the\r\nmonasteries, where were collected the treasures of the middle ages,\r\none would naturally suppose that the king would have gone farther, and\r\nchanged the religion of his people. But Henry hated Luther and his\r\ndoctrines, and did not hate the pope, or the religion of which he was\r\nthe sovereign pontiff. He loved gold and new wives better than the\r\ninterests of the Catholic church. Reform proceeded no farther in his\r\nreign; while, on the other hand, he caused a decree to pass both\r\nhouses of his timid, complying parliament, by which the doctrines of\r\ntransubstantiation, the communion of one kind, the celibacy of the\r\nclergy, masses, and auricular confession, were established; and any\r\ndeparture from, or denial of, these subjected the offender to the\r\npunishment of death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Execution of Anne Boleyn.]\r\n\r\nBut Henry had new domestic difficulties long before the suppression of\r\nmonasteries--the great political act of Thomas Cromwell. His new wife,\r\nAnne Boleyn, was suspected of the crime of inconstancy, and at the\r\nvery time when she had reached the summit of power, and the\r\ngratification of all worldly wishes. She had been very vain, and fond\r\nof display and of ornaments; but the latter years of her life were\r\nmarked by her munificence, and attachment to the reform doctrines. But\r\nher power ceased almost as soon as she became queen. She could win,\r\nbut she could not retain, the affections of her royal husband. His\r\npassion subsided into languor, and ended in disgust. The beauty of\r\nAnne Boleyn was soon forgotten when Jane Seymour, her maid of honor,\r\nattracted the attention of Henry. To make this lady his wife now\r\nbecame the object of his life, and this could only be effected by the\r\ndivorce of his queen, who gave occasion for scandal by the levity and\r\nfreedom of her manners. Henry believed every insinuation against her,\r\nbecause he wished to believe her guilty. There was but a step between\r\nthe belief of guilt and the resolution to destroy her. She was\r\ncommitted to the Tower, impeached, brought to trial, condemned without\r\nevidence, and executed without remorse. Even Cranmer, whom she had\r\nhonored and befriended, dared not defend her, although he must have\r\nbelieved in her innocence. He knew the temper of the master whom he\r\nserved too well to risk much in her defence. She was the first woman\r\nwho had been beheaded in the annals of England. Not one of the\r\nPlantagenet kings ever murdered a woman. But the age of chivalry was\r\npast, and the sentiments it encouraged found no response in the bosom\r\nof such a sensual and vindictive monarch as was Henry\xc2\xa0VIII.\r\n\r\nThe very day after the execution of that accomplished lady, for whose\r\nsake the king had squandered the treasures of his kingdom, and had\r\nkept Christendom in a ferment, he married Jane Seymour, "the fairest,\r\ndiscreetest, and most meritorious of all his wives," as the historians\r\nsay, yet a woman who did not hesitate to steal the affections of Henry\r\nand receive his addresses, while his queen was devoted to her husband.\r\nBut Anne Boleyn had done so before her, and suffered a natural\r\nretribution.\r\n\r\nJane Seymour lived only eighteen months after her marriage, and died\r\ntwo days after giving birth to a son, afterwards Edward\xc2\xa0VI. She was\r\none of those passive women who make neither friends nor enemies. She\r\nindulged in no wit or repartee, like her brilliant but less beautiful\r\npredecessor, and she passed her regal life without uttering a sentence\r\nor a sentiment which has been deemed worthy of preservation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anne of Cleves--Catharine Howard.]\r\n\r\nShe had been dead about a month, when the king looked round for\r\nanother wife, and besought Francis\xc2\xa0I. to send the most beautiful\r\nladies of his kingdom to Calais, that he might there inspect them, and\r\nselect one according to his taste. But this Oriental notion was not\r\nindulged by the French king, who had more taste and delicacy; and\r\nHenry remained without a wife for more than two years, the princesses\r\nof Europe not being very eager to put themselves in the power of this\r\nroyal Bluebeard. At last, at the suggestion of Cromwell, he was\r\naffianced to Anne, daughter of the Duke of Cleves, whose home was on\r\nthe banks of the Rhine, in the city of Dusseldorf.\r\n\r\nThe king no sooner set his eyes on her than he was disappointed and\r\ndisgusted, and gave vent to his feelings before Cromwell, calling her\r\na "great Flanders mare." Nevertheless, he consummated his marriage,\r\nalthough his disgust constantly increased. This mistake of Cromwell\r\nwas fatal to his ambitious hopes. The king vented on him all the\r\ndispleasure which had been gathering in his embittered soul.\r\nCromwell\'s doom was sealed. He had offended an absolute monarch. He\r\nwas accused of heresy and treason,--the common accusations in that age\r\nagainst men devoted to destruction,--tried by a servile board of\r\njudges, condemned, and judicially murdered, in 1540. In his\r\nmisfortunes, he showed no more fortitude than Wolsey. The atmosphere\r\nof a court is fatal to all moral elevation.\r\n\r\nBut, before his execution, Anne of Cleves, a virtuous and worthy\r\nwoman, was divorced, and Catharine Howard, granddaughter of the victor\r\nof Flodden Field, became queen of England. The king now fancied that\r\nhis domestic felicity was complete; but, soon after his marriage, it\r\nwas discovered that his wife had formerly led a dissolute life, and\r\nhad been unfaithful also to her royal master. When the proofs of her\r\nincontinence were presented to him, he burst into a flood of tears;\r\nbut soon his natural ferocity returned, and his guilty wife expiated\r\nher crime by death on the scaffold, in 1542.\r\n\r\nHenry\'s sixth and last wife was Catharine Parr, relict of Lord\r\nLatimer, a woman of great sagacity, prudence, and good sense. She\r\nfavored the reformers, but had sufficient address to keep her opinions\r\nfrom the king, who would have executed her, had he suspected her real\r\nviews. She survived her husband, who died four years after her\r\nmarriage, in 1547.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Last Days of Henry.]\r\n\r\nThe last years of any tyrant are always melancholy, and those of Henry\r\nwere embittered by jealousies and domestic troubles. His finances were\r\nderanged, his treasury exhausted, and his subjects discontented. He\r\nwas often at war with the Scots, and different continental powers. He\r\nadded religious persecution to his other bad traits, and executed, for\r\ntheir opinions, some of the best people in the kingdom. His father had\r\nleft him the richest sovereign of Europe, and he had seized the abbey\r\nlands, and extorted heavy sums from his oppressed people; and yet he\r\nwas poor. All his wishes were apparently gratified; and yet he was the\r\nmost miserable man in his dominions. He exhausted all the sources of\r\npleasure, and nothing remained but satiety and disgust. His mind and\r\nhis body were alike diseased. His inordinate gluttony made him most\r\ninconveniently corpulent, and produced ulcers and the gout. It was\r\ndangerous to approach this "corrupt mass of dying tyranny." It was\r\nimpossible to please him, and the least contradiction drove him into\r\nfits of madness and frenzy.\r\n\r\nIn his latter days, he ordered, in a fit of jealousy, the execution of\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk, the first nobleman of the kingdom, who had given\r\noffence to the Earl of Hertford, uncle to the young prince of Wales,\r\nand the founder of the greatness of the Seymours. But the tyrant died\r\nbefore the sentence was carried into effect, much to the joy of the\r\ngood people of England, whom he had robbed and massacred. Several\r\nthousands perished by the axe of the executioner during his\r\ndisgraceful reign, and some of them were the lights of the age, and\r\nthe glory of their country.\r\n\r\nTyrannical as was Henry\xc2\xa0VIII., still he ever ruled by the laws. He did\r\nnot abolish parliament, or retrench its privileges. The parliament\r\nauthorized all his taxes, and gave sanction to all his violent\r\nmeasures. The parliament was his supple instrument; still, had the\r\nparliament resisted his will, doubtless he would have dissolved it, as\r\ndid the Stuart princes. But it was not, in his reign, prepared for\r\nresistance, and the king had every thing after his own way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Henry\xc2\xa0VIII.]\r\n\r\nBy nature, he was amiable, generous, and munificent. But his temper\r\nwas spoiled by self-indulgence and incessant flattery. The moroseness\r\nhe exhibited in his latter days was partly the effect of physical\r\ndisease, brought about, indeed, by intemperance and gluttony. He was\r\nfaithful to his wives, so long as he lived with them; and, while he\r\ndoted on them, listened to their advice. But few of his advisers dared\r\ntell him the truth; and Cranmer himself can never be exculpated from\r\nflattering his perverted conscience. No one had the courage to tell\r\nhim he was dying but one of the nobles of the court. He died, in great\r\nagony, June, 1547, in the thirty-eighth year of his reign, and the\r\nfifty-sixth of his age, and was buried, with great pomp, in St. George\r\nChapel, Windsor Castle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--The best English histories of the reign of\r\n     Henry\xc2\xa0VIII. are the standard ones of Hume and Lingard.

AND MARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War with Scotland.]\r\n\r\nHenry\xc2\xa0VIII. was succeeded by his son, Edward\xc2\xa0VI., a boy of nine years\r\nof age, learned, pious, and precocious. Still he was a boy; and, as\r\nsuch, was a king but in name. The history of his reign is the history\r\nof the acts of his ministers.\r\n\r\nThe late king left a will, appointing sixteen persons, mostly members\r\nof his council, to be guardians of his son, and rulers of the nation\r\nduring his minority. The Earl of Hertford, being uncle of the king,\r\nwas unanimously named protector.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the council did was to look after themselves, that is,\r\nto give themselves titles and revenues. Hertford became Duke of\r\nSomerset; Essex, Marquis of Northampton; Lisle, Earl of Warwick; the\r\nChancellor Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. At the head of these\r\nnobles was Somerset. He was a Protestant, and therefore prosecuted\r\nthose reforms which Cranmer had before projected. Cranmer, as member\r\nof the council, archbishop of Canterbury, and friend of Somerset, had\r\nample scope to prosecute his measures.\r\n\r\nThe history of this reign is not important in a political point of\r\nview, and relates chiefly to the completion of the reformation, and to\r\nthe squabbles and jealousies of the great lords who formed the council\r\nof regency.\r\n\r\nThe most important event, of a political character, was a war with\r\nScotland, growing out of the attempts of the late king to unite both\r\nnations under one government. In consequence, Scotland was invaded by\r\nthe Duke of Somerset, at the head of eighteen thousand men. A great\r\nbattle was fought, in which ten thousand of the Scots were slain. But\r\nthe protector was compelled to return to England, without following up\r\nthe fruits of victory, in consequence of cabals at court. His brother,\r\nLord Seymour, a man of reckless ambition, had married the queen\r\ndowager, and openly aspired to the government of the kingdom. He\r\nendeavored to seduce the youthful king, and he had provided arms for\r\nten thousand men.\r\n\r\nThe protector sought to win his brother from his treasonable designs\r\nby kindness and favors; but, all his measures proving ineffectual, he\r\nwas arrested, tried, and executed, for high treason.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rebellions and Discontents.]\r\n\r\nBut Somerset had a more dangerous enemy than his brother; and this was\r\nthe Earl of Warwick, who obtained great popularity by his suppression\r\nof a dangerous insurrection, the greatest the country had witnessed\r\nsince Jack Cade\'s rebellion, one hundred years before. The discontent\r\nof the people appears to have arisen from their actual suffering. Coin\r\nhad depreciated, without a corresponding rise of wages, and labor was\r\ncheap, because tillage lands were converted to pasturage. The popular\r\ndiscontent was aggravated by the changes which the reformers\r\nintroduced, and which the peasantry were the last to appreciate. The\r\npriests and ejected monks increased the discontent, until it broke out\r\ninto a flame.\r\n\r\nThe protector made himself unpopular with the council by a law which\r\nhe caused to be passed against enclosures; and, as he lost influence,\r\nhis great rival, Warwick, gained power. Somerset, at last, was obliged\r\nto resign his protectorship; and Warwick, who had suppressed the\r\nrebellion, formed the chief of a new council of regency. He was a man\r\nof greater talents than Somerset, and equal ambition, and more fitted\r\nfor stormy times.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his power was established, and the country was at peace,\r\nand he had gained friends, he began to execute those projects of\r\nambition which he had long formed. The earldom of Northumberland\r\nhaving reverted to the crown, Warwick aspired to the extinct title and\r\nthe estates, and procured for himself a grant of the same, with the\r\ntitle of duke. But there still remained a bar to his elevation; and\r\nthis was the opposition of the Duke of Somerset, who, though disgraced\r\nand unpopular, was still powerful. It is unfortunate to be in the way\r\nof a great man\'s career, and Somerset paid the penalty of his\r\nopposition--the common fate of unsuccessful rivals in unsettled times.\r\nHe was accused of treason, condemned, and executed, (1552.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rivalry of the Great Nobles.]\r\n\r\nNorthumberland, as the new dictator, seemed to have attained the\r\nhighest elevation to which a subject could aspire. In rank, power, and\r\nproperty, he was second only to the royal family, but his ambition\r\nknew no bounds, and he began his intrigues to induce the young king,\r\nwhose health was rapidly failing, and who was zealously attached to\r\nProtestantism, to set aside the succession of his sister Mary to the\r\nthrone, really in view of the danger to which the reformers would be\r\nsubjected, but under pretence of her declared illegitimacy, which\r\nwould also set aside the claims of the Princess Elizabeth. Mary, Queen\r\nof Scots, was to be set aside on the ground of the will of the late\r\nking, and the succession would therefore devolve on the Lady Jane\r\nGrey, granddaughter of the Duke of Suffolk and of the French queen,\r\nwhom he hoped to unite in marriage with his son. This was a\r\ndeeply-laid scheme, and came near being successful, since Edward\r\nlistened to it with pleasure. Northumberland then sought to gain over\r\nthe judges and other persons of distinction, and succeeded by bribery\r\nand intimidation. At this juncture, the young king died, possessed of\r\nall the accomplishments which could grace a youth of sixteen, but\r\nstill a tool in the hands of his ministers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious Reforms.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the political movements of this reign--memorable for the\r\nrivalries of the great nobles. But it is chiefly distinguished for the\r\nchanges which were made in the church establishment, and the\r\nintroduction of the principles of the continental reformers. No\r\nchanges of importance were ever made beyond what Cranmer and his\r\nassociates effected. Indeed, all that an absolute monarch could do,\r\nwas done, and done with prudence, sagacity, and moderation. The people\r\nquietly--except in some rural districts--acquiesced in the change.\r\nMost of the clergy took the new oath of allegiance to Edward\xc2\xa0VI., as\r\nsupreme head of the church; and very few suffered from religious\r\npersecution. There is no period in English history when such important\r\nchanges were made, with so little bloodshed. Cranmer always watched\r\nthe temper of the nation, and did nothing without great caution. Still\r\na great change was effected--no less than a complete change from\r\nRomanism to Protestantism. But it was not so radical a reform as the\r\nPuritans subsequently desired, since the hierarchy and a liturgy, and\r\nclerical badges and dresses, were retained. It was the fortune of\r\nCranmer, during the six years of Edward\'s reign, to effect the two\r\ngreat objects of which the English church has ever since been\r\nproud--the removal of Roman abuses, and the establishment of the creed\r\nof Luther and Calvin; and this without sweeping away the union of\r\nchurch and state, which, indeed, was more intimate than before the\r\nreformation. The papal power was completely subverted. Nothing more\r\nremained to be done by Cranmer. He had compiled the Book of Common\r\nPrayer, abolished the old Latin service, the worship of images, the\r\nceremony of the mass, and auricular confessions. He turned the altars\r\ninto communion tables, set up the singing of psalms in the service,\r\ncaused the communion to be administered in both kinds to the laity,\r\nadded the litany to the ritual, prepared a book of homilies for the\r\nclergy, invited learned men to settle in England, and magnificently\r\nendowed schools and universities.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation is divested of much interest, since it was the work of\r\n_authority_, rather than the result of _popular convictions_. But\r\nCranmer won immortal honor for his skilful management, and for making\r\nno more changes than he could sustain. A large part of the English\r\nnation still regard his works as perfect, and are sincerely and\r\nenthusiastically attached to the form which he gave to his church.\r\n\r\nThe hopes of his party were suddenly dispelled by the death of the\r\namiable prince whom he controlled, 6th of July, 1553. The succession\r\nto the throne fell to the Princess Mary, or, as princesses were then\r\ncalled, the _Lady_ Mary; nor could all the arts of Northumberland\r\nexclude her from the enjoyment of her rights. This ambitious nobleman\r\ncontrived to keep the death of Edward\xc2\xa0VI. a secret two days, and\r\nsecure from the Mayor and Alderman of London a promise to respect the\r\nwill of the late king. In consequence, the Lady Jane Grey was\r\nproclaimed Queen of England. "So far was she from any desire of this\r\nadvancement, that she began to act her part of royalty with many\r\ntears, thus plainly showing to those who had access to her, that she\r\nwas forced by her relations and friends to this high, but dangerous\r\npost." She was accomplished, beautiful, and amiable, devoted to her\r\nyoung husband, and very fond of Plato, whom she read in the original.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Execution of Northumberland.]\r\n\r\nBut Mary\'s friends exerted themselves, and her cause--the cause of\r\nlegitimacy, rather than that of Catholicism--gained ground.\r\nNorthumberland was unequal to this crisis, and he was very feebly\r\nsustained. His forces were suppressed, his schemes failed, and his\r\nhopes fled. From rebellion, to the scaffold, there is but a step; and\r\nthis great nobleman suffered the fate of Somerset, his former rival.\r\nHis execution confirms one of the most striking facts in the history\r\nof absolute monarchies, when the idea of legitimacy is firmly\r\nimpressed on the national mind; and that is, that no subject, or\r\nconfederacy of subjects, however powerful, stand much chance in\r\nresisting the claims or the will of a legitimate prince. A nod or a\r\nword, from such a king, can consign the greatest noble to hopeless\r\nimpotence. And he can do this from the mighty and mysterious force of\r\nideas alone. Neither king nor parliament can ever resist the\r\nomnipotence of popular ideas. When ideas establish despots on their\r\nthrones, they are safe. When ideas demand their dethronement, no\r\nforces can long sustain them. The age of Queen Mary was the period of\r\nthe most unchecked absolutism in England. Mary was apparently a\r\npowerless woman when Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed queen by the party\r\nof Northumberland, and still she had but to signify her intentions to\r\nclaim her rights, and the nation was prostrate at her feet. The\r\nProtestant party dreaded her accession; but loyalty was a stronger\r\nprinciple than even Protestantism, and she was soon firmly established\r\nin the absolute throne of Henry\xc2\xa0VIII.\r\n\r\nThen almost immediately followed a total change in the administration,\r\nwhich affected both the political and religious state of the country.\r\nThose who had languished in confinement, on account of their religion,\r\nobtained their liberty, and were elevated to power. Gardiner, Bonner,\r\nand other Catholic bishops, were restored to their sees, while\r\nCranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper Coverdale, and other eminent\r\nProtestants, were imprisoned. All the statutes of Edward\xc2\xa0VI.\r\npertaining to religion were repealed, and the queen sent assurances to\r\nthe pope of her allegiance to his see. Cardinal Pole, descended from\r\nthe royal family of England, and a man of great probity, moderation,\r\nand worth, was sent as legate of the pope. Gardiner, Bishop of\r\nWinchester, was made lord chancellor, and became the prime minister.\r\nHe and his associates recommended violent councils; and a reign,\r\nunparalleled in England for religious persecution, commenced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marriage of the Queen.]\r\n\r\nSoon after the queen\'s accession, she married Philip, son of the\r\nEmperor Charles, and heir of the Spanish monarchy. This marriage,\r\nbrought about by the intrigues of the emperor, and favored by the\r\nCatholic party, was quite acceptable to Mary, whose issue would\r\ninherit the thrones of Spain and England. But ambitious matches are\r\nseldom happy, especially when the wife is much older than the husband,\r\nas was the fact in this instance. Mary, however, was attached to\r\nPhilip, although he treated her with great indifference.\r\n\r\nThis Spanish match, the most brilliant of that age, failed, however,\r\nto satisfy the English, who had no notion of becoming the subjects of\r\nthe King of Spain. In consequence of this disaffection, a rebellion\r\nbroke out, in which Sir Thomas Wyatt was the most conspicuous, and in\r\nwhich the Duke of Suffolk, and even the Lady Jane and her husband,\r\nwere implicated, though unjustly. The rebellion was easily suppressed,\r\nand the leaders sent to the Tower. Then followed one of the most\r\nmelancholy executions of this reign--that of the Lady Jane Grey, who\r\nhad been reprieved three months before. The queen urged the plea of\r\nself-defence, and the safety of the realm--the same that Queen\r\nElizabeth, in after times, made in reference to the Queen of the\r\nScots. Her unfortunate fate excited great popular compassion, and she\r\nsuffered with a martyr\'s constancy, and also her husband--two\r\nillustrious victims, sacrificed in consequence of the ambition of\r\ntheir relatives, and the jealousy of the queen. The Duke of Suffolk,\r\nthe father of Lady Jane, was also executed, and deserved his fate,\r\naccording to the ideas of his age. The Princess Elizabeth expected\r\nalso to be sacrificed, both because she was a Protestant and the next\r\nheiress to the throne. But she carefully avoided giving any offence,\r\nand managed with such consummate prudence, that she was preserved for\r\nthe future glory and welfare of the realm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious Persecution.]\r\n\r\nThe year 1555 opened gloomily for the Protestants. The prisons were\r\nall crowded with the victims of religious persecution, and bigoted\r\ninquisitors had only to prepare their fagots and stakes. Over a\r\nthousand ministers were ejected from their livings, and such as\r\nescaped further persecution fled to the continent. No fewer than two\r\nhundred and eighty-eight persons, among whom were five bishops,\r\ntwenty-one clergymen, fifty-five women, and four children, were burned\r\nfor religious opinions, besides many thousands who suffered various\r\nother forms of persecution. The constancy of Ridley, Latimer, and\r\nHooper has immortalized their names on the list of illustrious\r\nmartyrs: but the greatest of all the victims was Cranmer, Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury. The most artful and insinuating promises were held out\r\nto him, to induce him to retract. Life and dignities were promised\r\nhim, if he would consent to betray his cause. In an evil hour, he\r\nyielded to the temptation, and consented to sell his soul. Timid,\r\nheartbroken, and old, the love of life and the fear of death were\r\nstronger than the voice of conscience and his duty to his God. But,\r\nwhen he found he was mocked, he came to himself, and suffered\r\npatiently and heroically. His death was glorious, as his life was\r\nuseful; and the sincerity of his repentance redeemed his memory from\r\nshame. Cranmer may be considered as the great author of the English\r\nReformation, and one of the most worthy and enlightened men of his\r\nage; but he was timid, politic, and time-serving. The Reformation\r\nproduced no perfect characters in any country. Some great defect\r\nblemished the lives of all the illustrious men who have justly earned\r\nimperishable glory. But the character of such men as Cranmer, and\r\nRidley, and Latimer, present an interesting contrast to those of\r\nGardiner and Bonner. The former did show, however, some lenity in the\r\nlatter years of this reign of Mary; but the latter, the Bishop of\r\nLondon, gloated to the last in the blood which he caused to be shed.\r\nHe even whipped the Protestant prisoners with his own hands, and once\r\npulled out the beard of an heretical weaver, and held his finger in\r\nthe flame of a candle, till the veins shrunk and burnt, that he might\r\nrealize what the pain of burning was. So blind and cruel is religious\r\nintolerance.\r\n\r\nBut Providence ordered that the religious persecution, which is\r\nattributed to Mary, but which, in strict justice, should be ascribed\r\nto her counsellors and ministers, should prepare the way for a popular\r\nand a spiritual movement in the subsequent reign. The fires of\r\nSmithfield, and the cruelties of the pillory and the prison, opened\r\nthe eyes of the nation to the spirit of the old religion, and also\r\ncaused the flight of many distinguished men to Frankfort and Geneva,\r\nwhere they learned the principles of both religious and civil liberty.\r\n"The blood of martyrs proved the seed of the church"--a sublime truth,\r\nrevealed to Cranmer and Ridley amid the fires which consumed their\r\nvenerable bodies; and not to them merely, but to all who witnessed\r\ntheir serenity, and heard their shouts of triumph when this mortal\r\npassed to immortality. Heretics increased with the progress of\r\npersecution, and firm conviction took the place of a blind confession\r\nof dogmas. "It was not," says Milman, "until Christ was lain in his\r\nrock-hewn sepulchre, that the history of Christianity commenced." We\r\nmight add, it was not until the fires of Smithfield were lighted, that\r\ngreat spiritual ideas took hold of the popular mind, and the intense\r\nreligious earnestness appeared which has so often characterized the\r\nEnglish nation. The progress which man makes is generally seen through\r\ndisaster, suffering, and sorrow. This is one of the fundamental truths\r\nwhich history teaches.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Mary.]\r\n\r\nThe last years of the reign of Mary were miserable to herself, and\r\ndisastrous to the nation. Her royal husband did not return her warm\r\naffections, and left England forever. She embarked in a ruinous war\r\nwith France, and gained nothing but disgrace. Her health failed, and\r\nher disposition became gloomy. She continued, to the last, most\r\nintolerant in her religious opinions, and thought more of restoring\r\nRomanism, than of promoting the interests of her kingdom. Her heart\r\nwas bruised and broken, and her life was a succession of sorrows. It\r\nis fashionable to call this unfortunate queen the "bloody Mary," and\r\nnot allow her a single virtue; but she was affectionate, sincere,\r\nhigh-minded, and shrunk from the dissimulation and intrigue which\r\ncharacterized "the virgin queen"--the name given to her masculine but\r\nenergetic successor. Mary was capable of the warmest friendship; was\r\nattentive and considerate to her servants, charitable to the poor, and\r\nsympathetic with the unfortunate, when not blinded by her religious\r\nprejudices. She had many accomplishments, and a very severe taste, and\r\nwas not addicted to oaths, as was Queen Elizabeth and her royal\r\nfather. She was, however, a bigoted Catholic; and how could partisan\r\nhistorians see or acknowledge her merits?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accession of Elizabeth.]\r\n\r\nBut her reign was disastrous, and the nation hailed with enthusiasm\r\nthe accession of Elizabeth, on the 17th of November, 1558. With her\r\nreign commences a new epoch, even in the history of Europe. Who does\r\nnot talk of the Elizabethan era, when Protestantism was established in\r\nEngland, when illustrious poets and philosophers adorned the\r\nliterature of the country, when commerce and arts received a great\r\nimpulse, when the colonies in North America were settled, and when a\r\nconstellation of great statesmen raised England to a pitch of glory\r\nnot before attained?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--See Hume\'s, and Lingard\'s, and other standard\r\n     Histories of England; Miss Strickland\'s Lives of the Queens\r\n     of England; Burnet\'s History of the Reformation; Life of\r\n     Cranmer; Fox\'s Book of Martyrs. These works contain all the\r\n     easily-accessible information respecting the reigns of\r\n     Edward and Mary, which is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\xc2\xa0VI.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH.\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Henry\xc2\xa0VIII., by Anne Boleyn, was in her\r\ntwenty-sixth year when she ascended the throne. She was crowned the\r\n15th of June, 1559, and soon assembled her parliament and selected her\r\nministers. After establishing her own legitimacy, she set about\r\nsettling the affairs of the church, but only restored the Protestant\r\nreligion as Cranmer had left it. Indeed, she ever retained a fondness\r\nfor ceremonial, and abhorred a reform spirit among the people. She\r\ninsisted on her supremacy, as head of the church, and on conformity\r\nwith her royal conscience. But she was not severe on the Catholics,\r\nand even the gluttonous and vindictive Bonner was permitted to end his\r\ndays in peace.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Protestant religion was established, the queen turned\r\nher attention towards Scotland, from which much trouble was expected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mary, Queen of Scots.]\r\n\r\nScotland was then governed by Mary, daughter of James\xc2\xa0V., and had\r\nsucceeded her father while a mere infant, eight days after her birth,\r\n(1542.) In 1558, she married the dauphin, afterwards King of France,\r\nby which marriage she was Queen of France as well as of Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Knox.]\r\n\r\nAccording to every canonical law of the Roman church, the claim of\r\nMary Stuart to the English throne was preferable to that of her cousin\r\nElizabeth. Her uncles, the Guises, represented that Anne Boleyn\'s\r\nmarriage had never been lawful, and that Elizabeth was therefore\r\nillegitimate. In an evil hour, she and her husband quartered the arms\r\nof England with their own, and assumed the titles of King and Queen of\r\nScotland and England. And Elizabeth\'s indignation was further excited\r\nby the insult which the pope had inflicted, in declaring her birth\r\nillegitimate. She, therefore, resolved to gratify, at once, both her\r\nambition and her vengeance, encouraged by her ministers, who wished to\r\nadvance the Protestant interest in the kingdom. Accordingly,\r\nElizabeth, with consummate art, undermined the authority of Mary in\r\nScotland, now distracted by religious as well as civil commotions.\r\nMary was a Catholic, and had a perfect abhorrence and disgust of the\r\nopinions and customs of the reformers, especially of John Knox, whose\r\ninfluence in Scotland was almost druidical. The Catholics resolved to\r\npunish with fire and sword, while the Protestants were equally intent\r\non defending themselves with the sword. And it so happened that some\r\nof the most powerful of the nobility were arrayed on the side of\r\nProtestantism. But the Scotch reformers were animated with a zeal\r\nunknown to Cranmer and his associates. The leaders had been trained at\r\nGeneva, under the guidance of Calvin, and had imbibed his opinions,\r\nand were, therefore, resolved to carry the work of reform after the\r\nmodel of the Genevan church. Accordingly, those pictures, and statues,\r\nand ornaments, and painted glass, and cathedrals, which Cranmer\r\nspared, were furiously destroyed by the Scotch reformers, who\r\nconsidered them as parts of an idolatrous worship. The antipathy to\r\nbishops and clerical vestments was equally strong, and a sweeping\r\nreform was carried on under the dictatorship of Knox. Elizabeth had no\r\nmore sympathy with this bold, but uncouth, reformer and his movements,\r\nthan had Mary herself, and never could forgive him for his book,\r\nwritten at Geneva, aimed against female government, called the "First\r\nBlast of a Trumpet against the monstrous Regiment of Women." But Knox\r\ncared not for either the English or the Scottish queens, and zealously\r\nand fearlessly prosecuted his work, and gained over to his side the\r\nmoral strength of the kingdom. Of course, a Catholic queen resolved to\r\nsuppress his doctrines; but nearly the whole Scottish nobility rallied\r\naround his standard, marching with the Bible in one hand, and the\r\nsword in the other. The queen brought in troops from France to support\r\nher insulted and tottering government, which only increased the zeal\r\nof the Protestant party, headed by the Earls of Argyle, Arran, Morton,\r\nand Glencairn, and James Stuart, Prior of St. Andrews, who styled\r\nthemselves "Lords of the Congregation." A civil war now raged in\r\nScotland, between the queen regent, who wished to suppress the\r\nnational independence, and extinguish the Protestant religion, and the\r\nProtestants, who comprised a great part of the nation, and who were\r\nresolved on the utter extirpation of Romanism and the limitation of\r\nthe regal power. The Lords of the Congregation implored the aid of\r\nEngland, which Elizabeth was ready to grant, both from political and\r\nreligious motives. The Protestant cause was in the ascendant, when the\r\nqueen regent died, in 1560. The same year died Francis II., of France;\r\nand Mary, now a widow, resolved to return to her own kingdom. She\r\nlanded at Leith, August, 1561, and was received with the grandest\r\ndemonstration of joy. For a time, affairs were tolerably tranquil,\r\nMary having intrusted the great Protestant nobles with power. She was\r\ngreatly annoyed, however, by Knox, who did not treat her with the\r\nrespect due to a queen, and who called her Jezebel; but the reformer\r\nescaped punishment on account of his great power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marriage of Mary--Darnley.]\r\n\r\nIn 1565, Mary married her cousin, Lord Darnley, son of the Earl of\r\nLennox,--a match exceedingly distasteful to Elizabeth, who was ever\r\njealous of Mary, especially in matrimonial matters, since the Scottish\r\nqueen had not renounced her pretensions to the throne of her\r\ngrandfather, Henry\xc2\xa0VII. The character of Elizabeth now appears in its\r\nworst light; and meanness and jealousy took the place of that\r\nmagnanimity which her admirers have ascribed to her. She fomented\r\ndisturbances in Scotland, and incited the queen\'s natural brother, the\r\nPrior of St. Andrews, now Earl of Murray, to rebellion, with the\r\nexpectation of obtaining the government of the country. He formed a\r\nconspiracy to seize the persons of Mary and her husband. The plot was\r\ndiscovered, and Murray fled to England; but it was still unremittingly\r\npursued, till at length it was accomplished.\r\n\r\nDarnley, the consort of Mary, was a man of low tastes, profligate\r\nhabits, and shallow understanding. Such a man could not long retain\r\nthe affections of the most accomplished woman of her age, accustomed\r\nto flattery, and bent on pursuing her own pleasure, at any cost.\r\nDisgust and coldness therefore took place. Darnley, enraged at this\r\nincreasing coldness, was taught to believe that he was supplanted in\r\nthe queen\'s affections by an Italian favorite, the musician Rizzio,\r\nwhom Mary had made her secretary. He therefore signed a bond, with\r\ncertain lords, for the murder of the Italian, who seems to have been a\r\nman of no character. One evening, as the queen was at supper, in her\r\nprivate apartment, with the countess of Argyle and Rizzio, the Earl of\r\nMorton, with one hundred and sixty men, took possession of the palace\r\nof Holyrood, while Darnley himself showed the way to a band of\r\nruffians to the royal presence. Rizzio was barbarously murdered in the\r\npresence of the queen, who endeavored to protect him.\r\n\r\nDarnley, in thus perpetrating this shocking murder, was but the tool\r\nof some of the great lords, who wished to make him hateful to the\r\nqueen, and to the nation, and thus prepare the way for his own\r\nexecution. And they succeeded. A plot was contrived for the murder of\r\nDarnley, of which Murray was probably the author. Shortly after, the\r\nhouse, in which he slept, was blown up by gunpowder, in the middle of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bothwell--Civil War in Scotland.]\r\n\r\nThe public voice imputed to the Earl of Bothwell, a great favorite of\r\nthe queen, the murder of Darnley. Nor did the queen herself escape\r\nsuspicion. "But no inquiry or research," says Scott, "has ever been\r\nable to bring us either to that clear opinion upon the guilt of Mary\r\nwhich is expressed by many authors, or guide us to that triumphant\r\nconclusion in favor of her innocence of all accession, direct or\r\ntacit, to the death of her husband, which others have maintained with\r\nthe same obstinacy." But whatever doubt exists as to the queen\'s\r\nguilt, there is none respecting her ministers--Maitland, Huntley,\r\nMorton, and Argyle. Still they offered a reward of two thousand pounds\r\nfor the discovery of the murderers. The public voice accused Bothwell\r\nas the principal: and yet the ministers associated with him, and the\r\nqueen, entirely exculpated him. He was brought to a trial, on the\r\nformal accusation of the Earl of Lennox, in the city of Edinburgh,\r\nwhich he was permitted to obtain possession of. In a place guarded by\r\nhis own followers, it was not safe for any witnesses to appear against\r\nhim, and he was therefore acquitted, though the whole nation believed\r\nhim guilty.\r\n\r\nMary was rash enough to marry, shortly after, the man whom public\r\nopinion pronounced to be the murderer of her husband; and Murray, her\r\nbrother, was so ambitious and treacherous, as to favor the marriage,\r\nwith the hope that the unpopularity of the act would lead to the\r\ndestruction of the queen, and place him at the helm of state. No\r\nsooner was Mary married to Bothwell, than Murray and other lords threw\r\noff the mask, pretended to be terribly indignant, took up arms against\r\nthe queen, with the view of making her prisoner, and with the pretence\r\nof delivering her from her husband. Bothwell escaped to Norway, and\r\nthe queen surrendered herself, at Carberry Hill, to the insurgent\r\narmy, the chiefs of which instantly assumed the reins of government,\r\nand confined the queen in the castle of Lochleven, and treated her\r\nwith excessive harshness. Shortly after, (1567,) she resigned her\r\ncrown to her infant son, and Murray, the prime mover of so many\r\ndisturbances, became regent of the kingdom. Murray was a zealous\r\nProtestant, and had the support of Knox in all his measures, and the\r\ncountenance of the English ministry. Abating his intrigue and\r\nambition, he was a most estimable man, and deserved the affections of\r\nthe nation, which he retained until his death. M\'Crie, in his Life of\r\nKnox, represents him as a model of Christian virtue and integrity, and\r\nevery way worthy of the place he held in the affections of his party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Captivity of Queen Mary.]\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate queen suffered great unkindness in her lonely\r\nconfinement, and Knox, with the more zealous of his party, clamored\r\nfor her death, as an adulteress and a murderer. She succeeded in\r\nescaping from her prison, raised an army, marched against the regent,\r\nwas defeated at the battle of Langside, fled to England, and became,\r\nMay, 1568, the prisoner-guest of her envious rival. Elizabeth obtained\r\nthe object of her desires. But the captivity of Mary, confined in\r\nTutbury Castle, against all the laws of hospitality and justice, gave\r\nrise to incessant disturbances, both in England and Scotland, until\r\nher execution, in 1587. And these form no inconsiderable part of the\r\nhistory of England for seventeen years. Scotland was the scene of\r\nanarchy, growing out of the contentions and jealousies of rival\r\nchieftains, who stooped to every crime that appeared to facilitate\r\ntheir objects. In 1570, the regent Murray was assassinated. He was\r\nsucceeded by his enemy, the Earl of Lennox, who, in his turn, was shot\r\nby an assassin. The Earl of Mar succeeded him, but lived only a year.\r\nMorton became regent, the reward of his many crimes but retribution at\r\nlast overtook him, being executed when James assumed the sovereignty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Execution of Mary.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the unfortunate Mary pined in hopeless captivity. It was\r\nnatural for her to seek release, and also for her friends to help her.\r\nAmong her friends was the Duke of Norfolk, the first nobleman in\r\nEngland, and a zealous Catholic. He aspired to her hand; but Elizabeth\r\nchose to consider his courtship as a treasonable act, and Norfolk was\r\narrested. On being afterwards released, he plotted for the liberation\r\nof Mary, and his intrigues brought him to the block. The unfortunate\r\ncaptive, wearied and impatient, naturally sought the assistance of\r\nforeign powers. She had her agents in Rome, France, Spain, and the Low\r\nCountries. The Catholics in England espoused her cause, and a\r\nconspiracy was formed to deliver her, assassinate Elizabeth, and\r\nrestore the Catholic religion. From the fact that Mary was privy to\r\nthat part of it which concerned her own deliverance, she was brought\r\nto trial as a criminal, found guilty by a court incompetent to sit on\r\nher case, and executed without remorse, 8th February, 1587.\r\n\r\nFew persons have excited more commiseration than this unfortunate\r\nqueen, both on account of her exalted rank, and her splendid\r\nintellectual accomplishments. Whatever obloquy she merited for her\r\nacts as queen of Scotland, no one can blame her for meditating escape\r\nfrom the power of her zealous but more fortunate rival; and her\r\nexecution is the greatest blot in the character of the queen of\r\nEngland, at this time in the zenith of her glory.\r\n\r\nNext to the troubles with Scotland growing out of the interference of\r\nElizabeth, the great political events of the reign were the long and\r\nprotracted war with Spain, and the Irish rebellion. Both of these\r\nevents were important.\r\n\r\nSpain was at this time governed by Philip\xc2\xa0II., son of the emperor\r\nCharles, one of the most bigoted Catholics of the age, and allied with\r\nCatharine de Medicis of France for the entire suppression of\r\nProtestantism. She incited her son Charles\xc2\xa0IX. to the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew, and Philip established the inquisition in Flanders. This\r\nmeasure provoked an insurrection, to suppress which the Duke of Alva,\r\none of the most celebrated of the generals of Charles\xc2\xa0V., was sent\r\ninto the Netherlands with a large army, and almost unlimited powers.\r\nThe cruelties of Alva were unparalleled. In six years, eighteen\r\nthousand persons perished by the hands of the executioner, and Alva\r\ncounted on the entire suppression of Protestantism by the mere force\r\nof armies. He could count the physical resources of the people, but he\r\ncould not estimate the degree of their resistance when animated by the\r\nspirit of liberty or religion. Providence, too, takes care of those\r\nwho strive to take care of themselves. A great leader appeared among\r\nthe suffering Hollanders, almost driven to despair--the celebrated\r\nWilliam of Nassau, Prince of Orange. He appeared as the champion of\r\nthe oppressed and insulted people; they rallied around his standard,\r\nfought with desperate bravery, opened the dikes upon their cultivated\r\nfields, expelled their invaders, and laid the foundation of their\r\nliberties. But they could not have withstood the gigantic power of the\r\nSpanish monarchy, then in the fulness of its strength, and the most\r\npowerful in Europe, had it not been for aid rendered by Elizabeth. She\r\ncompassionated their sufferings, and had respect for their cause. She\r\nentered into an alliance, defensive and offensive, and the Netherlands\r\nbecame the great theatre of war, even after they had thrown off the\r\nSpanish yoke. Although the United Provinces in the end obtained their\r\nliberty, they suffered incredible hardships, and lost some of the\r\nfinest of their cities, Antwerp among the rest, long the rival of\r\nAmsterdam, and the scene of Rubens\'s labors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military Preparations of Philip\xc2\xa0II.]\r\n\r\nThe assistance which Elizabeth rendered to the Hollanders, of course,\r\nprovoked the resentment of Philip\xc2\xa0II., and this was increased by the\r\nlegalized piracies of Sir Francis Drake, in the West Indies, and on\r\nthe coasts of South America. This commander, in time of peace,\r\ninsisted on a right to visit those ports which the Spaniards had\r\nclosed, which, by the law of nations, is piracy. Philip, according to\r\nall political maxims, was forced to declare war with England, and he\r\nmade immense preparations to subdue it. But the preparations of\r\nElizabeth to resist the powerful monarch were also great, and Drake\r\nperformed brilliant exploits on the sea, among other things,\r\ndestroying one hundred ships in the Bay of Cadiz, and taking immense\r\nspoil. The preparations of the Spanish monarch were made on such a\r\ngigantic scale, that Elizabeth summoned a great council of war to meet\r\nthe emergency, at which the all-accomplished Sir Walter Raleigh took a\r\nleading part. His advice was to meet the Spaniards on the sea.\r\nAlthough the royal navy consisted, at this time, of only thirty-six\r\nsail, such vigorous measures were prosecuted, that one hundred and\r\nninety-one ships were collected, manned by seventeen thousand four\r\nhundred seamen. The merchants of London granted thirty ships and ten\r\nthousand men, and all England was aroused to meet the expected danger.\r\nNever was patriotism more signally evinced, never were more decisive\r\nproofs given of the popularity of a sovereign. Indeed, Elizabeth was\r\nalways popular with the nation; and with all her ceremony, and state,\r\nand rudeness to the commons, and with all their apparent servility,\r\nshe never violated the laws, or irritated the people by oppressive\r\nexactions. Many acts of the Tudor princes seem to indicate the reign\r\nof despotism in England, but this despotism was never grievous, and\r\nhad all the benignity of a paternal government. Capricious and\r\narbitrary as Elizabeth was, in regard to some unfortunate individuals\r\nwho provoked her hatred or her jealousy, still she ever sedulously\r\nguarded the interests of the nation, and listened to the counsel of\r\npatriotic and able ministers. When England was threatened with a\r\nSpanish invasion, there was not a corner of the land which did not\r\nrise to protect a beloved sovereign; nor was there a single spot,\r\nwhere a landing might be effected, around which an army of twenty\r\nthousand could not be rallied in forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish Armada.]\r\n\r\nBut Philip, nevertheless, expected the complete conquest of England;\r\nand, as his "Invincible Armada" of one hundred and thirty ships, left\r\nthe mouth of the Tagus, commanded by Medina Sidonia, and manned by the\r\nnoblest troops of Spain, he fancied his hour of triumph was at hand.\r\nBut his hopes proved dreams, like most of the ambitious designs of\r\nmen. The armada met with nothing but misfortunes, both from battle and\r\nfrom storms. Only fifty ships returned to Spain. An immense booty was\r\ndivided among the English sailors, and Elizabeth sent, in her turn, a\r\nlarge fleet to Spain, the following year, (1589,) under the command of\r\nDrake, which, after burning a few towns, returned ingloriously to\r\nEngland, with a loss of ten thousand men. The war was continued with\r\nvarious success till 1598, when a peace was negotiated. The same year,\r\ndied Philip\xc2\xa0II., and Lord Burleigh, who, for forty years, directed the\r\ncouncils of Elizabeth, and to whose voice she ever listened, even when\r\nopposed by such favorites as Leicester and Essex. Burleigh was not a\r\ngreat genius, but was a man admirably adapted to his station and his\r\ntimes,--was cool, sagacious, politic, and pacific, skilful in the\r\ndetails of business competent to advise, but not aspiring to command.\r\nHe was splendidly rewarded for his services, and left behind him three\r\nhundred distinct landed estates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irish Rebellion.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the attention of the queen was directed to the affairs of\r\nIreland, which had been conquered by Henry\xc2\xa0II. in the year 1170, but\r\nover which only an imperfect sovereignty had been exercised. The Irish\r\nprinces and nobles, divided among themselves, paid the exterior marks\r\nof obedience, but kept the country in a constant state of\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nThe impolitic and romantic projects of the English princes for\r\nsubduing France, prevented a due attention to Ireland, ever miserably\r\ngoverned. Elizabeth was the first of the English sovereigns to\r\nperceive the political importance of this island, and the necessity\r\nfor the establishment of law and order. Besides furnishing governors\r\nof great capacity, she founded the university of Dublin, and attempted\r\nto civilize the half-barbarous people. Unfortunately, she also sought\r\nto make them Protestants, against their will, which laid the\r\nfoundation of many subsequent troubles, not yet removed. A spirit of\r\ndiscontent pervaded the country, and the people were ready for\r\nrebellion. Hugh O\'Neale, the head of a powerful clan, and who had been\r\nraised to the dignity of Earl of Tyrone, yet attached to the barbarous\r\nlicense in which he had been early trained, fomented the popular\r\ndiscontents, and excited a dangerous rebellion. Hostilities, of the\r\nmost sanguinary character, commenced. The queen sent over her\r\nfavorite, the Earl of Essex, with an army of twenty thousand men, to\r\ncrush the rebellion. He was a brave commander, but was totally\r\nunacquainted with the country and the people he was expected to\r\nsubdue, and was, consequently, unsuccessful. But his successor, Lord\r\nMountjoy, succeeded in restoring the queen\'s authority, though at the\r\ncost of four millions and a half, an immense sum in that age, while\r\npoor Ireland was devastated with fire and sword, and suffered every\r\naggravation of accumulated calamities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earl of Essex.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Essex, who had returned to England against the queen\'s\r\norders, was treated with coldness, deprived of his employments, and\r\nsentenced to be confined. This was more than the haughty favorite\r\ncould bear, accustomed as he had been to royal favor. At first, he\r\nacquiesced in his punishment, with every mark of penitence, and\r\nElizabeth was beginning to relax in her severity for she never\r\nintended to ruin him; but he soon gave vent to his violent temper,\r\nindulged in great liberties of speech, and threw off all appearance of\r\nduty and respect. He even engaged in treasonable designs, encouraged\r\nRoman Catholics at his house, and corresponded with James\xc2\xa0VI. of\r\nScotland about his succession. His proceedings were discovered, and he\r\nwas summoned before the privy council. Instead of obedience, he armed\r\nhimself and his followers, and, in conjunction with some discontented\r\nnobles, and about three hundred gentlemen, attempted to excite an\r\ninsurrection in London, where he was very popular with the citizens.\r\nHe was captured and committed to the Tower, with the Earl of\r\nSouthampton. These rash but brave noblemen were tried by their peers,\r\nand condemned as guilty of high treason. In this trial, the celebrated\r\nBacon appeared against his old patron, and likened him to the Duke of\r\nGuise. The great lawyer Coke, who was attorney-general, compared him\r\nto Catiline.\r\n\r\nEssex disdained to sue the queen for a pardon, and was privately\r\nbeheaded in the Tower. He merited his fate, if the offence of which he\r\nwas guilty deserved such a punishment. It is impossible not to be\r\ninterested in the fate of a man so brave, high-spirited, and generous,\r\nthe idol of the people, and the victor in so many enterprises. Some\r\nhistorians maintain that Elizabeth relented, and would have saved her\r\nfavorite, had he only implored her clemency; but this statement is\r\ndenied by others; nor have we any evidence to believe that Essex,\r\ncaught with arms against the sovereign who had honored him, could have\r\naverted his fate.\r\n\r\nElizabeth may have wept for the death of the nobleman she had loved.\r\nIt is certain that, after his death, she never regained her spirits,\r\nand that a deep melancholy was visible in her countenance. All her\r\nactions showed a deeply-settled inward grief, and that she longed for\r\ndeath, having tasted the unsubstantial nature of human greatness. She\r\nsurvived the execution of Essex two years, but lived long enough to\r\nsee the neglect into which she was every day falling, and to feel\r\nthat, in spite of all her glory and power, she was not exempted from\r\ndrinking the cup of bitterness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Elizabeth.]\r\n\r\nWhatever unamiable qualities she evinced as a woman, in spite of her\r\nvanity, and jealousy, and imperious temper, her reign was one of the\r\nmost glorious in the annals of her country. The policy of Burleigh was\r\nthe policy of Sir Robert Walpole--that of peace, and a desire to\r\nincrease the resources of the kingdom. Her taxes were never\r\noppressive, and were raised without murmur; the people were loyal and\r\ncontented; the Protestant religion was established on a firm\r\nfoundation; and a constellation of great men shed around her throne\r\nthe bright rays of immortal genius.\r\n\r\nThe most unhappy peculiarity of her reign was the persecution of the\r\nNon-conformists, which, if not sanguinary, was irritating and severe.\r\nFor some time after the accession of Elizabeth, the Puritans were\r\npermitted to indulge in their peculiarities, without being excluded\r\nfrom the established church; but when Elizabeth felt herself secure,\r\nthen they were obliged to conform, or suffered imprisonment, fines,\r\nand other punishments. The original difficulty was their repugnance to\r\nthe surplice, and to some few forms of worship, which gradually\r\nextended to an opposition to the order of bishops; to the temporal\r\ndignities of the church; to the various titles of the hierarchy; to\r\nthe jurisdiction of the spiritual courts; to the promiscuous access of\r\nall persons to the communion table; to the liturgy; to the observance\r\nof holydays; to the cathedral worship; to the use of organs; to the\r\npresentation of living by patrons; and finally, to some of the\r\ndoctrines of the established church. The separation of the Puritans\r\nfrom the Episcopal church, took place in 1566; and, from that time to\r\nthe death of Elizabeth, they enjoyed no peace, although they sought\r\nredress in the most respectful manner, and raised no opposition to the\r\nroyal authority. Thousands were ejected from their livings, and\r\notherwise punished, for not conforming to the royal conscience. But\r\npersecution and penal laws fanned a fanatical spirit, which, in the\r\nreign of Charles, burst out into a destructive flame, and spread\r\ndevastation and ruin through all parts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIf the queen and her ministers did not understand the principles of\r\nreligious toleration, they pursued a much more enlightened policy in\r\nregard to all financial and political subjects, than during any former\r\nreign. The commercial importance of England received a new impulse.\r\nThe reign of Henry\xc2\xa0VIII. was a reign of spoliation. The king was\r\nenriched beyond all former precedent, but his riches did not keep pace\r\nwith his spendthrift habits. The value of the abbey lands which Henry\r\nseized amounted, a century after his death, to six million pounds. The\r\nlands of the abbey of St. Alban\'s alone rented for two hundred\r\nthousand pounds. The king debased the coin, confiscated chapels and\r\ncolleges, as well as monasteries, and raised money by embargoes,\r\nmonopolies, and compulsory loans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Improvements Made in the Reign of Elizabeth.]\r\n\r\nBut Elizabeth, instead of contracting debts, paid off the old ones,\r\nrestored the coin to its purity, and was content with an annual\r\nrevenue of five hundred thousand pounds, even at a time when the\r\nrebellion in Ireland cost her four hundred thousand pounds. Her\r\nfrugality equalled the rapacity of her father, and she was extravagant\r\nonly in dress, and on great occasions of public rejoicings. But her\r\neconomy was a small matter compared with the wise laws which were\r\npassed respecting the trade of the country, by which commercial\r\nindustry began to characterize the people. Improvements in navigation\r\nfollowed, and also maritime discoveries and colonial settlements. Sir\r\nFrancis Drake circumnavigated the globe, and the East India Company\r\nwas formed. Under the auspices of Sir Walter Raleigh, Virginia was\r\ndiscovered and colonized. Unfortunately, also, the African slave trade\r\ncommenced--a traffic which has been productive of more human misery,\r\nand led to more disastrous political evils, than can be traced to any\r\nother event in the history of modern times.\r\n\r\nDuring this reign, the houses of the people became more comfortable;\r\nchimneys began to be used; pewter dishes took the place of wooden\r\ntrenchers, and wheat was substituted for rye and barley; linen and\r\nwoollen cloth was manufactured; salads, cabbages, gooseberries,\r\napricots, pippins, currants, cherries, plums, carnations, and the\r\ndamask rose were cultivated, for the first time. But the great glory\r\nof this reign was the revival of literature and science. Raleigh, "the\r\nsoldier, the sailor, the scholar, the philosopher, the poet, the\r\norator, the historian, the courtier," then, adorned the court, and the\r\nprince of poets, the immortal Shakspeare, then wrote those plays,\r\nwhich, for moral wisdom and knowledge of the human soul, appear to us\r\nalmost to be dictated by the voice of inspiration. The prince of\r\nphilosophers too, the great miner and sapper of the false systems of\r\nthe middle ages, Francis Bacon, then commenced his career, and Spenser\r\ndedicated to Elizabeth his "Fairy Queen," one of the most truly\r\npoetical compositions that genius ever produced. The age produced also\r\ngreat divines; but these did not occupy so prominent a place in the\r\nnation\'s eye as during the succeeding reigns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reflections.]\r\n\r\nWhile the virgin queen was exercising so benign an influence on the\r\nEnglish nation, great events, though not disconnected with English\r\npolitics, were taking place on the continent. The most remarkable of\r\nthese was the persecution of the Huguenots. The rise and fortunes of\r\nthis sect, during the reigns of Henry\xc2\xa0II., Francis\xc2\xa0II., Charles\xc2\xa0IX.,\r\nHenry III., and Henry\xc2\xa0IV., now demand our attention. If a newspaper\r\nhad, in that age, been conducted upon the principles it now is, the\r\nsufferings of the Huguenots would always be noticed. It is our\r\nprovince to describe just what a modern newspaper would have alluded\r\nto, had it been printed three hundred years ago. It would not have\r\nbeen filled with genealogies of kings, but with descriptions of great\r\npopular movements. And this is history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--For the history of this reign, see Hume,\r\n     Lingard, and Hallam; Miss Strickland\'s Queens of England;\r\n     Life of Mary, Queen of Scots; M\'Crie\'s Life of Knox;\r\n     Robertson\'s History of Scotland; Macaulay\'s Essay on Nares\'s\r\n     Life of Burleigh; Life of Sir Walter Raleigh; Neale\'s\r\n     History of the Puritans.

The\r\nHuguenotic contest, then, is a great historical subject, and will be\r\npresented in connection with the history of France, until the death of\r\nHenry\xc2\xa0IV., the greatest of the French monarchs, and long the\r\nillustrious head of the Protestant party.\r\n\r\nThe reform doctrines first began to spread in France during the reign\r\nof Francis\xc2\xa0I. As early as 1523, he became a persecutor, and burned\r\nmany at the stake, among whom the descendants of the Waldenses were\r\nthe most numerous. In 1540, sentence was pronounced against them by\r\nthe parliament of Aix. Their doctrines were the same in substance as\r\nthose of the Swiss reformers.\r\n\r\nWhile this persecution was raging, John Calvin fled from France to\r\nFerrara, from which city he proceeded to Geneva. This was in the year\r\n1536, when his theological career commenced by the publication of his\r\nInstitutes, which were dedicated to Francis\xc2\xa0I., one of the most\r\nmasterly theological works ever written, although compended from the\r\nwritings of Augustine. The Institutes of Calvin, the great text-book\r\nof the Swiss and French reformers, were distasteful to the French\r\nking, and he gave fresh order for the persecution of the Protestants.\r\nNotwithstanding the hostility of Francis, the new doctrines spread,\r\nand were embraced by some of the most distinguished of the French\r\nnobility. The violence of persecution was not much arrested during the\r\nreign of Henry\xc2\xa0II., and, through the influence of the Cardinal of\r\nLorraine, the inquisition was established in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catharine de Medicis.]\r\n\r\nThe wife of Henry\xc2\xa0II. was the celebrated Catharine de Medicis; and she\r\nwas bitterly opposed to the reform doctrines, and incited her husband\r\nto the most cruel atrocities. Francis\xc2\xa0II. continued the persecution,\r\nand his mother, Catharine, became virtually the ruler of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe power of the queen mother was much increased when Francis\xc2\xa0II.\r\ndied, and when his brother, Charles\xc2\xa0IX., a boy of nine years of age,\r\nsucceeded to the French crown. She exercised her power by the most\r\nunsparing religious persecution recorded in the history of modern\r\nEurope. There had been some hope that Protestantism would be\r\nestablished in France; but it did not succeed, owing to the violence\r\nof the persecution. It made, however, a desperate struggle before it\r\nwas overcome.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Catholic party were the queen regent, the Cardinal\r\nof Lorraine, the Duke of Guise, his brother, and the Constable\r\nMontmorency. They had the support of the priesthood, of the Spaniards,\r\nand a great majority of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants were headed by the King of Navarre, father of\r\nHenry\xc2\xa0IV., the Prince of Cond\xc3\xa9, his brother, and Admiral Coligny; and\r\nthey had the sympathy of the university, the parliaments, and the\r\nProtestants of Germany and England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil War in France.]\r\n\r\nBetween these parties a struggle lasted for forty years, with various\r\nsuccess. Persecution provoked resistance, but resistance did not lead\r\nto liberty. Civil war in France did not secure the object sought.\r\nStill the Protestants had hope, and, as they could always assemble a\r\nlarge army, they maintained their ground. Their conduct was not marked\r\nby the religious earnestness which characterized the Puritans, or by\r\nthe same strength of religious principle. Moreover, political motives\r\nwere mingled with religious. The contest was a struggle for the\r\nascendency of rival chiefs, as well as for the establishment of\r\nreformed doctrines. The Bourbons hated the Guises, and the Guises\r\nresolved to destroy the Bourbons. In the course of their rivalry and\r\nwarfare, the Duke of Guise was assassinated, and the King of Navarre,\r\nas well as the Prince of Cond\xc3\xa9, were killed.\r\n\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0IX. was fourteen years of age when the young king of\r\nNavarre,--at that time sixteen years of age,--and his cousin, the\r\nPrince of Cond\xc3\xa9, became the acknowledged heads of the Protestant\r\nparty. Their education was learned in the camp and the field of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0IX., under the influence of his hateful mother, finding that\r\ncivil war only destroyed the resources of the country, without\r\nweakening the Protestants, made peace, but formed a plan for their\r\nextermination by treachery. In order to cover his designs he gave his\r\nsister, Margaret de Valois, in marriage to the King of Navarre, first\r\nprince of the blood, then nineteen years of age. Admiral Coligny was\r\ninvited to Paris, and treated with distinguished courtesy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacre of St. Bartholomew.]\r\n\r\nIt was during the festivities which succeeded the marriage of the King\r\nof Navarre that Coligny was murdered, and the signal for the horrid\r\nslaughter of St. Bartholomew was given. At midnight, August 23, 1572,\r\nthe great bell at the Hotel de Ville began to toll; torches were\r\nplaced in the windows, chains were drawn across the streets, and armed\r\nbodies collected around the hotels. The doors of the houses were\r\nbroken open, and neither age, condition, nor sex was spared, of such\r\nas were not distinguished by a white cross in the hat. The massacre at\r\nParis was followed by one equally brutal in the provinces. Seventy\r\nthousand people were slain in cold blood. The King of Navarre and the\r\nPrince of Cond\xc3\xa9 only escaped in consequence of their relationship with\r\nthe king, and by renouncing the Protestant religion.\r\n\r\nMost of the European courts expressed their detestation of this\r\nfoulest crime in the history of religious bigotry; but the pope went\r\nin grand procession to his cathedral, and ordered a _Te Deum_ to be\r\nsung in commemoration of an event which steeped his cause in infamy to\r\nthe end of time.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants, though nearly exterminated, again rallied, and the\r\nKing of Navarre and his cousin the Prince of Cond\xc3\xa9 escaped, renounced\r\nthe religion which had been forced on them by fear of death, and\r\nprosecuted a bloody civil war, with the firm resolution of never\r\nabandoning it until religious liberty was guarantied.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Charles\xc2\xa0IX. died, as it was supposed, by poison. His last\r\nhours were wretched, and his remorse for the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew filled his soul with agony. He beheld spectres, and\r\ndreamed horrid dreams; his imagination constantly saw heaps of livid\r\nbodies, and his ears were assailed with imaginary groans. He became\r\nmelancholy and ferocious, while his kingdom became the prey of\r\nfactions and insurrections. But he was a timid and irresolute king,\r\nand was but the tool of his infamous mother, the grand patroness of\r\nassassins, against whom, on his death bed, he cautioned the king of\r\nNavarre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry\xc2\xa0III.--Henry\xc2\xa0IV.]\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by his brother, the King of Poland, under the title\r\nof Henry\xc2\xa0III. The persecutions of the Huguenots were renewed, and the\r\nold scenes of treachery, assassination, and war were acted over again.\r\nThe cause of religion was lost sight of in the labyrinth of\r\ncontentions, jealousies, and plots. Intrigues and factions were\r\nendless. Nearly all the leaders, on both sides, perished by the sword\r\nor the dagger. The Prince of Cond\xc3\xa9, the Duke of Guise, and his\r\nbrother, the Cardinal of Lorraine, were assassinated. Shortly after,\r\ndied the chief mover of all the troubles, Catharine de Medicis, a\r\nwoman of talents and persuasive eloquence, but of most unprincipled\r\nambition, perfidious, cruel, and dissolute. She encouraged the\r\nlicentiousness of the court, and even the worst vices of her sons,\r\nthat she might make them subservient to her designs. All her passions\r\nwere subordinate to her calculations of policy, and every womanly\r\nvirtue was suppressed by the desire of wielding a government which she\r\nusurped.\r\n\r\nHenry\xc2\xa0III. soon followed her to the grave, being, in turn,\r\nassassinated by a religious fanatic. His death (1589) secured the\r\nthrone to the king of Navarre, who took the title of Henry\xc2\xa0IV.\r\n\r\nHenry\xc2\xa0IV., the first of the Bourbon line, was descended from Robert,\r\nthe sixth son of St. Louis, who had married the daughter and heiress\r\nof John of Burgundy and Agnes of Bourbon. He was thirty-six years of\r\nage when he became king, and had passed through great experiences and\r\nmany sorrows. Thus far he had contended for Protestant opinions, and\r\nwas the acknowledged leader of the Protestant party in France. But a\r\nlife of contention and bloodshed, and the new career opened to him as\r\nking of France, cooled his religious ardor, and he did not hesitate to\r\naccept the condition which the French nobles imposed, before they\r\nwould take the oaths of allegiance. This was, that he should abjure\r\nProtestantism. "My kingdom," said he, "is well worth a mass." It will\r\nbe ever laid to his reproach, by the Protestants, that he renounced\r\nhis religion for worldly elevation. Nor is it easy to exculpate him on\r\nthe highest principles of moral integrity. But there were many\r\npalliations for his conduct, which it is not now easy to appreciate.\r\nIt is well known that the illustrious Sully, his prime minister, and,\r\nthrough life, a zealous Protestant, approved of his course. It was\r\ncertainly clear that, without becoming a Catholic, he never could\r\npeaceably enjoy his crown, and France would be rent, for another\r\ngeneration, by those civil wars which none lamented more than Henry\r\nhimself. Besides, four fifths of the population were Catholics, and\r\nthe Protestants could not reasonably expect to gain the ascendency.\r\nAll they could expect was religious toleration, and this Henry was\r\nwilling to grant. It should also be considered that the king, though\r\nhe professed the reform doctrines, was never what may be called a\r\nreligious man, being devoted to pleasure, and to schemes of ambition.\r\nIt is true he understood and consulted the interests of his kingdom,\r\nand strove to make his subjects happy. Herein consists his excellence.\r\nAs a magnanimous, liberal-minded, and enterprising man, he surpassed\r\nall the French kings. But it is ridiculous to call him a religious\r\nman, or even strongly fixed in his religious opinions. "Do you," said\r\nthe king to a great Protestant divine, "believe that a man may be\r\nsaved by the Catholic religion?" "Undoubtedly," replied the clergyman,\r\n"if his life and heart be holy." "Then," said the king, "prudence\r\ndictates that I embrace the Catholic religion, and not yours; for, in\r\nthat case, according to both Catholics and Protestants, I may be\r\nsaved; but, if I embrace your religion, I shall not be saved,\r\naccording to the Catholics."\r\n\r\nBut the king\'s conversion to Catholicism did not immediately result in\r\nthe tranquillity of the distracted country. The Catholics would not\r\nbelieve in his sincerity, and many battles had to be fought before he\r\nwas in peaceable enjoyment of his throne. But there is nothing so\r\nhateful as civil war, especially to the inhabitants of great cities;\r\nand Paris, at last, and the chief places in the kingdom, acknowledged\r\nhis sway. The king of Spain, the great Catholic prelates, and the\r\npope, finally perceived how hopeless was the struggle against a man of\r\ngreat military experience, with a devoted army and an enthusiastic\r\ncapital on his side.\r\n\r\nThe peace of Verviens, in 1598, left the king without foreign or\r\ndomestic enemies. From that period to his death, his life was devoted\r\nto the welfare of his country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edict of Nantes.]\r\n\r\nHis first act was the celebrated Edict of Nantes, by which the\r\nHuguenots had quiet and undisturbed residence, the free exercise of\r\ntheir religion, and public worship, except in the court, the army, and\r\nwithin five leagues of Paris. They were eligible to all offices, civil\r\nand military; and all public prosecutions, on account of religion,\r\nwere dropped. This edict also promulgated a general amnesty for\r\npolitical offences, and restored property and titles, as before the\r\nwar; but the Protestants were prohibited from printing controversial\r\nbooks, and were compelled to pay tithes to the established clergy.\r\n\r\nHenry\xc2\xa0IV., considering the obstacles with which he had to contend, was\r\nthe greatest general of the age; but it is his efforts in civilization\r\nwhich entitle him to his epithet of _Great_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Improvements during the Reign of Henry\xc2\xa0IV.]\r\n\r\nThe first thing which demanded his attention, as a civil ruler, was\r\nthe settlement of the finances--ever the leading cause of troubles\r\nwith the French government. These were intrusted to the care of Rosny,\r\nafterward Duke of Sully, the most able and upright of all French\r\nfinanciers--a man of remarkable probity and elevation of sentiment. He\r\never continued to be the minister and the confidant of the king, and\r\nmaintained his position without subserviency or flattery, almost the\r\nonly man on the records of history who could tell, with impunity,\r\nwholesome truths to an absolute monarch. So wise were his financial\r\narrangements, that a debt of three hundred million of livres was paid\r\noff in eight years. In five years, the taxes were reduced one half,\r\nthe crown lands redeemed, the arsenals stored, the fortifications\r\nrebuilt, churches erected, canals dug, and improvements made in every\r\npart of the kingdom. On the death of the king, he had in his treasury\r\nnearly fifty millions of livres. Under the direction of this able\r\nminister, the laws were enforced, robbery and vagrancy were nearly\r\nstopped, and agriculture received a great impulse. But economy was the\r\norder of the day. The king himself set an illustrious example, and\r\neven dressed in gray cloth, with a doublet of taffeta, without\r\nembroidery, dispensed with all superfluity at his table, and dismissed\r\nall useless servants.\r\n\r\nThe management and economy of the king enabled him to make great\r\nimprovements, besides settling the deranged finances of the kingdom.\r\nHe built innumerable churches, bridges, convents, hospitals,\r\nfortresses, and ships. Some of the finest palaces which adorn Paris\r\nwere erected by him. He was also the patron of learning, the benefits\r\nof which he appreciated. He himself was well acquainted with the\r\nwritings of the ancients. He was particularly fond of the society of\r\nthe learned, with whom he conversed with freedom and affability. He\r\nincreased the libraries, opened public schools, and invited\r\ndistinguished foreigners to Paris, and rewarded them with stipends.\r\nLipsius, Scaliger, and De Thou, were the ornaments of his court.\r\n\r\nAnd his tender regard to the happiness and welfare of his subjects was\r\nas marked as his generous appreciation of literature and science. It\r\nwas his ambition to be the father of his people; and his memorable\r\nsaying, "Yes, I will so manage matters that the poorest peasant in my\r\nkingdom may eat meat each day in the week, and, moreover, be enabled\r\nto put a fowl in the pot on a Sunday," has alone embalmed his memory\r\nin the affections of the French nation, who, of all their monarchs,\r\nare most partial to Henry\xc2\xa0IV.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peace Scheme of Henry\xc2\xa0IV.]\r\n\r\nBut this excellent king was also a philanthropist, and cherished the\r\nmost enlightened views as to those subjects on which rests the\r\nhappiness of nations. Though a warrior, the preservation of a lasting\r\npeace was the great idea of his life. He was even visionary in his\r\nprojects to do good; for he imagined it was possible to convince\r\nmonarchs that they ought to prefer purity, peace, and benevolence, to\r\nambition and war. Hence, he proposed to establish a Congress of\r\nNations, chosen from the various states of Europe, to whom all\r\ninternational difficulties should be referred, with power to settle\r\nthem--a very desirable object, the most so conceivable; for war is the\r\ngreatest of all national calamities and crimes. The scheme of the\r\nenlightened Henry, however, did not attract much attention; and, even\r\nhad it been encouraged, would have been set aside in the next\r\ngeneration. What would such men as Frederic the Great, or Marlborough,\r\nor Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., or Napoleon have cared for such an object? But Henry,\r\nin his scheme, also had in view the regulation of such forces as the\r\nEuropean monarchs should sustain, and this arose from his desire to\r\npreserve the "Balance of Power"--the great object of European\r\npoliticians in these latter times.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Henry\xc2\xa0IV.]\r\n\r\nBut Henry was not permitted, by Providence, to prosecute his\r\nbenevolent designs. He was assassinated by a man whom he had never\r\ninjured--by the most unscrupulous of all misguided men--a religious\r\nbigot. The Jesuit Ravaillac, in a mood, as it is to be hoped,\r\nbordering on madness, perpetrated the foul deed. But Henry only\r\nsuffered the fate of nearly all the distinguished actors in those\r\ncivil and religious contentions which desolated France for forty\r\nyears. He died in 1610, at the age of fifty-seven, having reigned\r\ntwenty-one years, nine of which were spent in uninterrupted warfare.\r\n\r\nBy his death the kingdom was thrown into deep and undissembled\r\nmourning. Many fell speechless in the streets when the intelligence of\r\nhis assassination was known; others died from excess of grief. All\r\nfelt that they had lost more than a father, and nothing was\r\nanticipated but storms and commotions.\r\n\r\nHe left no children by his wife, Margaret de Valois, who proved\r\ninconstant, and from whom he was separated. By his second wife, Mary\r\nde Medicis, he had three children, the oldest of whom was a child when\r\nhe ascended the throne, by the title of Louis\xc2\xa0XIII. His daughter,\r\nHenrietta, married Charles\xc2\xa0I. of England.\r\n\r\nThough great advances were made in France during this reign, it was\r\nstill far from that state of civilization which it attained a century\r\nafterwards. It contained about fifteen million of inhabitants, and\r\nParis about one hundred and fifty thousand. The nobles were numerous\r\nand powerful, and engrossed the wealth of the nation. The people were\r\nnot exactly slaves, but were reduced to great dependence, were\r\nuneducated, degraded, and enjoyed but few political or social\r\nprivileges. They were oppressed by the government, by the nobles, and\r\nby the clergy.\r\n\r\nThe highest official dignitary was the constable, the second the\r\nkeeper of the seals, the third the chamberlain, then the six or eight\r\nmarshals, then the secretary of state, then gentlemen of the\r\nhousehold, and military commanders. The king was nearly absolute. The\r\nparliament was a judicial tribunal, which did not enact laws, but\r\nwhich registered the edicts of the king.\r\n\r\nCommerce and manufactures were extremely limited, and far from\r\nflourishing; and the arts were in an infant state. Architecture, the\r\nonly art in which half-civilized nations have excelled, was the most\r\nadvanced, and was displayed in the churches and royal palaces. Paris\r\nwas crowded with uncomfortable houses, and the narrow streets were\r\nfavorable to tumult as well as pestilence. Tapestry was the most\r\ncommon and the most expensive of the arts, and the hangings, in a\r\nsingle room, often reached a sum which would be equal, in these times,\r\nto one hundred thousand dollars. The floors of the palaces were spread\r\nwith Turkey carpets. Chairs were used only in kings\' palaces, and\r\ncarriages were but just introduced, and were clumsy and awkward. Mules\r\nwere chiefly used in travelling, the horses being reserved for war.\r\nDress, especially of females, was gorgeous and extravagant; false\r\nhair, masks, trailed petticoats, and cork heels ten inches high, were\r\nsome of the peculiarities. The French then, as now, were fond of the\r\npleasures of the table, and the hour for dinner was eleven o\'clock.\r\nMorals were extremely low, and gaming was a universal passion, in\r\nwhich Henry\xc2\xa0IV. himself extravagantly indulged. The advice of\r\nCatharine de Medicis to her son Charles\xc2\xa0IX. showed her knowledge of\r\nthe French character, even as it exists now: "Twice a week give public\r\nassemblies, for the specific secret of the French government is, to\r\nkeep the people always cheerful; for they are so restless you must\r\noccupy them, during peace, either with business or amusement, or else\r\nthey will involve you in trouble."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: France at the Death of Henry\xc2\xa0IV.]\r\n\r\nSuch was France, at the death of Henry\xc2\xa0IV., 1610, one of the largest\r\nand most powerful of the European kingdoms, though far from the\r\ngreatness it was destined afterwards to attain.\r\n\r\nA more powerful monarchy, at this period, was Spain. As this kingdom\r\nwas then in the zenith of its power and glory, we will take a brief\r\nsurvey of it during the reign of Philip\xc2\xa0II., the successor of\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0V., a person to whom we have often referred. With his reign\r\nare closely connected the struggles of the Hollanders to secure their\r\ncivil and religious independence. The Low Countries were provinces of\r\nSpain, and therefore to be considered in connection with Spanish\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--For a knowledge of France during the reign of\r\n     Henry\xc2\xa0IV., see James\'s History of Henry\xc2\xa0IV.; James\'s Life of\r\n     Cond\xc3\xa9; History of the Huguenots. Rankin\'s and Crowe\'s\r\n     Histories of France are the best in English, but far\r\n     inferior to Sismondi\'s, Millot\'s, and Lacretelle\'s. Sully\'s\r\n     Memoirs throw considerable light on this period, and Dumas\'s\r\n     Margaret de Valois may be read with profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\xc2\xa0VIII.\r\n\r\nPHILIP\xc2\xa0II. AND THE AUSTRIAN PRINCES OF SPAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bigotry of Philip\xc2\xa0II.]\r\n\r\nSpain cannot be said to have been a powerful state until the reign of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella; when the crowns of Castile and Arragon were\r\nunited, and when the discoveries of Columbus added a new world to\r\ntheir extensive territories. Nor, during the reign of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, was the power of the crown as absolute as during the sway of\r\nthe Austrian princes. The nobles were animated by a bold and free\r\nspirit, and the clergy dared to resist the encroachments of royalty,\r\nand even the usurpations of Rome. Charles\xc2\xa0V. succeeded in suppressing\r\nthe power of the nobles, and all insurrections of the people, and laid\r\nthe foundation for the power of his gloomy son, Philip\xc2\xa0II. With Philip\r\ncommenced the grandeur of the Spanish monarchy. By him, also, were\r\nsown the seeds of its subsequent decay. Under him, the inquisition was\r\ndisgraced by ten thousand enormities, Holland was overrun by the Duke\r\nof Alva, and America conquered by Cortes and Pizarro. It was he who\r\nbuilt the gorgeous palaces of Spain, and who, with his Invincible\r\nArmada, meditated the conquest of England. The wealth of the Indies\r\nflowed into the royal treasury, and also enriched all orders and\r\nclasses. Silver and gold became as plenty at Madrid as in old times at\r\nJerusalem under the reign of Solomon. But Philip was a different\r\nprince from Solomon. His talents and attainments were respectable, but\r\nhe had a jealous and selfish disposition, and exerted all the energies\r\nof his mind, and all the resources of his kingdom, to crush the\r\nProtestant religion and the liberties of Europe.\r\n\r\nAmong the first acts of his reign was the effort to extinguish\r\nProtestantism in the Netherlands, an assemblage of seigniories, under\r\nvarious titles, subject to his authority. The opinions of Luther and\r\nCalvin made great progress in this country, and Philip, in order to\r\nrepress them, created new bishops, and established the Inquisition.\r\nThe people protested, and these protests were considered as\r\nrebellious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt of the Netherlands.]\r\n\r\nAt the head of the nobility was William, the Prince of Orange, on whom\r\nPhilip had conferred the government of Holland, Zealand, Friesland,\r\nand Utrecht, provinces of the Netherlands. He was a haughty but\r\nresolute and courageous character, and had adopted the opinions of\r\nCalvin, for which he lost the confidence of Philip. In the prospect of\r\ndestruction, he embraced the resolution of delivering his country from\r\nthe yoke of a merciless and bigoted master. Having reduced the most\r\nimportant garrisons of Holland and Zealand, he was proclaimed\r\nstadtholder, and openly threw off his allegiance to Spain.\r\nHostilities, of course, commenced. Alva, the general of Philip, took\r\nthe old city of Haerlem, and put fifteen hundred to the sword, among\r\nwhom were all the magistrates, and all the Protestant clergy.\r\n\r\nDon John, Archduke of Austria, and the brother of Philip, succeeded\r\nthe Duke of Alva, during whose administration the seven United\r\nProvinces formed themselves into a confederation, and chose the Prince\r\nof Orange to be the general of their armies, admiral of their fleets,\r\nand chief magistrate, by the title of _stadtholder_. But William was\r\nsoon after assassinated by a wretch who had been bribed by the\r\nexasperated Philip, and Maurice, his son, received his title,\r\ndignities, and power. His military talents, as the antagonist of the\r\nDuke of Parma, lieutenant to Philip, in the Netherlands, secured him a\r\nhigh place in the estimation of warriors. To protect this prince and\r\nthe infant republic of Holland, Queen Elizabeth sent four thousand men\r\nunder the Earl of Leicester, her favorite; and, with this assistance,\r\nthe Hollanders maintained their ground against the most powerful\r\nmonarch in Europe, as has been already mentioned in the chapter on\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nAfter the loss of the Netherlands, the next great event of his reign\r\nwas the acquisition of Portugal, to which he laid claim on the death\r\nof Don Henry, in 1581. There were several other claimants, but Philip,\r\nwith an army of twenty thousand, was stronger than any of the others.\r\nHe gained a decisive victory over Don Antonio, uncle to the last\r\nmonarch, and was crowned at Lisbon without opposition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt of the Moriscoes.]\r\n\r\nThe revolt of the Moriscoes occupies a prominent place in the annals\r\nof this reign. They were Christianized Moors, but, at heart,\r\nMohammedans. A decree had been published that their children should\r\nfrequent the Christian church, that the Arabic should no longer be\r\nused in writing, that both men and women should wear the Spanish\r\ncostume, that they no longer should receive Mohammedan names, or marry\r\nwithout permission. The Moriscoes contended that no particular dress\r\ninvolved religious opinions, that the women used the veil according to\r\ntheir notions of modesty, that the use of their own language was no\r\nsin, and that baths were used, not from religious motives, but for the\r\nsake of cleanliness. These expostulations were, however, without\r\neffect. Nothing could move the bigoted king. So revolt followed\r\ncruelty and oppression. Great excesses were committed by both parties,\r\nand most horrible barbarities were exhibited. The atrocious nature of\r\ncivil war is ever the same, and presents nearly the same undeviating\r\npicture of misery and crime. But in this war there was something\r\nfiendish. A clergyman was roasted over a brazier, and the women,\r\nwearied with his protracted death, despatched him with their needles\r\nand knives. The rebels ridiculed the sacrifice of the mass by\r\nslaughtering a pig on the high altar of a church. These insults were\r\nretaliated with that cruelty which Spanish bigotry and malice know so\r\nwell how to inflict. Thousands of defenceless women and children were\r\nmurdered in violation of the most solemn treaties. The whole Moorish\r\npopulation was finally exterminated, and Granada, with its beautiful\r\nmountains and fertile valleys, was made a desert. No less than six\r\nhundred thousand were driven to Africa--an act of great impolicy,\r\nsince the Moriscoes were the most ingenious and industrious part of\r\nthe population; and their exile contributed to undermine that national\r\nprosperity in which, at that day, every Spaniard gloried. But\r\ndestruction ever succeeds pride: infatuation and blindness are the\r\nattendants of despotism.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the Spanish Armada, and the losses which the\r\nSpaniards suffered from Sir Francis Drake and Admiral Hawkins, have\r\nalready been mentioned. But the pride of Philip was mortified, rather\r\nthan that his power was diminished. His ambition received a check, and\r\nhe found it impossible to conquer England. His finances, too, became\r\nderanged; still he remained the absolute master of the richest kingdom\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Causes of Decline of the Spanish Monarchy.]\r\n\r\nThe decline of the Spanish monarchy dates from his death which took\r\nplace in his magnificent palace of the Escurial, in 1598. Under his\r\nson Philip\xc2\xa0III., decline became very marked, and future ruin could be\r\npredicted.\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of the decline of prosperity was the great\r\nincrease of the clergy, and the extent of their wealth. In the Spanish\r\ndominions, which included Spain, Naples, Milan, Parma, Sicily,\r\nSardinia, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the Indies, there were\r\nfifty-four archbishops, six hundred and eighty-four bishops, seven\r\nthousand hospitals, one hundred thousand abbeys and nunneries, six\r\nhundred thousand monks, and three hundred and ten thousand secular\r\npriests--a priest to every ten families. Almost every village had a\r\nmonastery. The diocese of Seville had fourteen thousand priests,\r\nnearly the present number of all the clergy of the establishment in\r\nEngland. The cathedral of Seville gave support and occupation to one\r\nhundred priests.\r\n\r\nAnd this numerous clergy usurped the power and dignities of the state.\r\nThey also encouraged that frightful inquisition, the very name of\r\nwhich conjures up the most horrid images of death and torture. This\r\ninstitution, committed to the care of Dominican monks, was instituted\r\nto put down heresy; that is, every thing in poetry, philosophy, or\r\nreligion, which was distasteful to the despots of the human mind. The\r\ninquisitors had power to apprehend people even suspected of heresy,\r\nand, on the testimony of two witnesses, could condemn them to torture,\r\nimprisonment, and death. Resistance was vain; complaint was ruin.\r\nArrests took place suddenly and secretly. Nor had the prisoner a\r\nknowledge of his accusers, or of the crimes of which he was accused.\r\nThe most delicate maidens, as well as men of hoary hairs and known\r\nintegrity, were subjected to every outrage that human nature could\r\nbear, or satanic ingenuity inflict. Should the jailer take compassion,\r\nand bestow a few crumbs of bread or drops of water, he would be\r\npunished as the greatest of traitors. Even nobles were not exempted\r\nfrom the supervision of this court, which was established in every\r\nvillage and town in Portugal and Spain, and which, in the single city\r\nof Toledo, condemned, in one year, seventeen thousand people. This\r\ninstitution was tolerated by the king, since he knew very well that\r\nthere ever exists an intimate union between absolutism in religion and\r\nabsolutism in government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Increase of Gold and Silver.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of the Spanish Monarchy.]\r\n\r\nBesides the spiritual despotism which the clergy of Spain exercised\r\nover a deluded people, but a people naturally of fine elements of\r\ncharacter, the sudden increase of gold and silver led to luxury,\r\nidleness, and degeneracy. Money being abundant, in consequence of the\r\ngold and silver mines of America, the people neglected the cultivation\r\nof those things which money could procure. Then followed a great rise\r\nin the prices of all kinds of provision and clothing. Houses, lands,\r\nand manufactures also soon rose in value. Hence money was delusive,\r\nsince, with ten times the increase of specie, there was a\r\ncorresponding decrease in those necessaries of life which gold and\r\nsilver would purchase. Silver and gold are only the medium of trade,\r\nnot the basis of wealth. The real prosperity of a country depends upon\r\nthe amount of productive industry. If diamonds were as numerous as\r\ncrystals, they would be worth no more than crystals. The sudden influx\r\nof the precious metals into Spain doubtless gave a temporary wealth to\r\nthe kingdom; but when habits of industry were lost, and the culture of\r\nthe soil was neglected, the gold and silver of the Spaniards were\r\nexchanged for the productive industry of other nations. The Dutch and\r\nthe English, whose manufactures and commerce were in a healthy state,\r\nbecame enriched at their expense. With the loss of substantial wealth,\r\nthat is, industry and economy, the Spaniards lost elevation of\r\nsentiment, became cold and proud, followed frivolous pleasures and\r\namusements, and acquired habits which were ruinous. Plays, pantomimes,\r\nand bull-fights now amused the lazy and pleasure-seeking nation, while\r\nthe profligacy of the court had no parallel in Europe, with the\r\nexception of that of France. The country became exhausted by war. The\r\nfinances were deranged, and province after province rebelled. Every\r\nwhere were military reverses, and a decrease of population. Taxes, in\r\nthe mean while, increased, and a burdened people lamented in vain\r\ntheir misfortune and decline. The reign of Philip\xc2\xa0IV. was the most\r\ndisastrous in the annals of the country. The Catalan insurrection, the\r\nloss of Jamaica, the Low Countries, and Portugal, were the results of\r\nhis misrule and imbecility. So rapidly did Spain degenerate, that,\r\nupon the close of the Austrian dynasty, with all the natural\r\nadvantages of the country, the best harbors and sea-coast in Europe,\r\nthe richest soil, and the finest climate, and with the possession of\r\nthe Indies also, the people were the poorest, the most ignorant, and\r\nthe most helpless in Europe. The death of Charles\xc2\xa0II., a miserable,\r\nafflicted, superstitious, priest-ridden monarch, left Spain without a\r\nking, and the vacant throne became the prize of any monarch in Europe\r\nwho could raise and send across the Pyrenees the largest army. It fell\r\ninto the power of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., and the Bourbon princes have ever since\r\nin vain attempted the restoration of the broken monarchy to its former\r\nglory. But, alas, Spain has, since the spoliation of the Mexicans and\r\nPeruvians, only a melancholy history--a history of crime, bigotry,\r\nanarchy, and poverty. The Spaniards committed awful crimes in their\r\nlust for gold and silver. "They had their request," but God, in his\r\nretributive justice, "sent leanness into their souls."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     For the history of Spain during the Austrian princes, see a\r\n     history in Lardner\'s Encyclopedia; Watson\'s Life of\r\n     Philip\xc2\xa0II.; James\'s Foreign Statesmen; Schiller\'s Revolt of\r\n     the Netherlands; Russell\'s Modern Europe; Prescott\'s\r\n     Conquest of Mexico and Peru.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\xc2\xa0IX.\r\n\r\nTHE JESUITS, AND THE PAPAL POWER IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman Power in the Seventeenth Century.]\r\n\r\nDuring the period we have just been considering, the most marked\r\npeculiarity was, the struggle between Protestantism and Romanism. It\r\nis true that objects of personal ambition also occupied the minds of\r\nprinces, and many great events occurred, which were not connected with\r\nthe struggles for religious liberty and light. But the great feature\r\nof the age was the insurrection of human intelligence. There was a\r\nspirit of innovation, which nothing could suppress, and this was\r\ndirected, in the main, to matters of religion. The conflict was not\r\nbetween church and state, but between two great factions in each. "No\r\nman asked whether another belonged to the same country as himself, but\r\nwhether he belonged to the same sect." Luther, Calvin, Zwingle, Knox,\r\nCranmer, and Bacon were the great pioneers in this march of\r\ninnovation. They wished to explode the ideas of the middle ages, in\r\nphilosophy and in religion. They made war upon the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, as the great supporter and defender of old ideas. They\r\nrenounced her authority. She summoned her friends and vassals, rallied\r\nall her forces, and, with desperate energy, resolved to put down the\r\nspirit of reform. The struggles of the Protestants in England,\r\nGermany, France, and the Netherlands, alike manifested the same\r\nspirit, were produced by the same causes, and brought forth the same\r\nresults. The insurrection was not suppressed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of the Jesuits.]\r\n\r\nThe hostile movements of Rome, for a while, were carried on by armies,\r\nmassacres, assassinations, and inquisitions. The duke of Alva\'s\r\ncruelties in the Netherlands, St. Bartholomew\'s massacre in France,\r\ninquisitorial tortures in Spain, and Smithfield burnings in England,\r\nillustrate this assertion. But more subtle and artful agents were\r\nrequired, especially since violence had failed. Men of simple lives,\r\nof undoubted piety, of earnest zeal, and singular disinterestedness to\r\ntheir cause, arose, and did what the sword and the stake could not\r\ndo,--revived Catholicism, and caused a reaction to Protestantism\r\nitself. These men were Jesuits, the most faithful, intrepid, and\r\nsuccessful soldiers that ever enlisted under the banners of Rome. The\r\nrise and fortunes of this order of monks form one of the most\r\nimportant and interesting chapters in the history of the human race.\r\nTheir victories, and the spirit which achieved them, are well worth\r\nour notice. In considering them, it must be borne in mind, that the\r\nJesuits have exhibited traits so dissimilar and contradictory, that it\r\nis difficult to form a just judgment. While they were achieving their\r\nvictories, they appeared in a totally different light from what\r\ndistinguished them when they reposed on their laurels. In short, the\r\n_earlier_ and the _latter_ Jesuits were entirely different in their\r\nmoral and social aspects, although they had the same external\r\norganization. The principles of their system were always the same. The\r\nmen who defended them, at first, were marked by great virtues, but\r\nafterwards were deformed by equally as great vices. It was in the\r\nearly days of Jesuitism that the events we have recorded took place.\r\nHence our notice, at present, will be confined to the Jesuits when\r\nthey were worthy of respect, and, in some things, even of admiration.\r\nTheir courage, fidelity, zeal, learning, and intrepidity for half a\r\ncentury, have not been exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the order was Ignatius Loyola, a Spanish gentleman of\r\nnoble birth, who first appeared as a soldier at the siege of\r\nPampeluna, where he was wounded, about the time that Luther was\r\nwriting his theses, and disputing about indulgences. He amused\r\nhimself, on his sick bed, by reading the lives of the saints. His\r\nenthusiastic mind was affected, and he resolved to pass from worldly\r\nto spiritual knighthood. He became a saint, after the notions of the\r\nage; that is, he fasted, wore sackcloth, lived on roots and herbs,\r\npractised austerities, retired to lonely places, and spent his time in\r\ncontemplation and prayer. The people were attracted by his sanctity,\r\nand followed him in crowds. His heart burned to convert heretics; and,\r\nto prepare himself for his mission, he went to the universities, and\r\ndevoted himself to study. There he made some distinguished converts,\r\nall of whom afterwards became famous. In his narrow cell, at Paris, he\r\ninduced Francis Xavier, Faber, Laynez Bobadilla, and Rodriguez to\r\nembrace his views, and to form themselves into an association, for the\r\nconversion of the world. On the summit of Montmartre, these six young\r\nmen, on one star-lit night, took the usual monastic vows of _poverty_,\r\n_chastity_, and _obedience_, and solemnly devoted themselves to their\r\nnew mission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rapid Spread of the Jesuit Order.]\r\n\r\nThey then went to Rome, to induce the pope to constitute them a new\r\nmissionary order. But they were ridiculed as fanatics. Moreover, for\r\nseveral centuries, there had been great opposition in Rome against the\r\ninstitution of new monastic orders. It was thought that there were\r\norders enough; that the old should be reformed, not new ones created.\r\nEven St. Dominic and St. Francis had great difficulty in getting their\r\norders instituted. But Loyola and his companions made extraordinary\r\noffers. They professed their willingness to go wherever the pope\r\nshould send them, among Turks, heathens, or heretics, instantly,\r\nwithout condition, or reward.\r\n\r\nHow could the pope refuse to license them? His empire was in danger;\r\nLuther was in the midst of his victories; the power of ideas and truth\r\nwas shaking to its centre the pontifical throne; all the old orders\r\nhad become degenerate and inefficient, and the pope did not know where\r\nto look for efficient support. The venerable Benedictines were\r\nrevelling in the wealth of their splendid abbeys, while the Dominicans\r\nand the Franciscans had become itinerant vagabonds, peddling relics\r\nand indulgences, and forgetful of those stern duties and virtues which\r\noriginally characterized them. All the monks were inexhaustible\r\nsubjects of sarcasm and mockery. They even made scholasticism\r\nridiculous, and the papal dogmas contemptible. Erasmus laughed at\r\nthem, and Luther mocked them. They were sensual, lazy, ignorant, and\r\ncorrupt. The pope did not want such soldiers. But the followers of\r\nLoyola were full of ardor, talent, and zeal; willing to do any thing\r\nfor a sinking cause; able to do any thing, so far as human will can\r\navail. And they did not disappoint the pope. Great additions were\r\nmade. They increased with marvellous rapidity. The zealous, devout,\r\nand energetic, throughout all ranks in the Catholic church, joined\r\nthem. They spread into all lands. They became the confessors of kings,\r\nthe teachers of youth, the most popular preachers, the most successful\r\nmissionaries. In sixteen years after the scene of Montmartre, Loyola\r\nhad established his society in the affections and confidence of\r\nCatholic Europe, against the voice of universities, the fears of\r\nmonarchs, and the jealousy of the other monastic orders. In sixteen\r\nyears, from the condition of a ridiculed fanatic, whose voice,\r\nhowever, would have been disregarded a century earlier or later, he\r\nbecame one of the most powerful dignitaries of the church, influencing\r\nthe councils of the Vatican, moving the minds of kings, controlling\r\nthe souls of a numerous fraternity, and making his power felt, even in\r\nthe courts of Japan and China. Before he died, his spiritual sons had\r\nplanted their missionary stations amid Peruvian mines, amid the marts\r\nof the African slave trade, in the islands of the Indian Ocean, and in\r\nthe cities of Japan and China. Nay, his followers had secured the most\r\nimportant chairs in the universities of Europe, and had become\r\nconfessors to the most powerful monarchs, teachers in the best schools\r\nof Christendom, and preachers in its principal pulpits. They had\r\nbecome an organization, instinct with life, endued with energy and\r\nwill, and forming a body which could outwatch Argus with his hundred\r\neyes, and outwork Briareus with his hundred arms. It had forty\r\nthousand eyes open upon every cabinet and private family in Europe,\r\nand forty thousand arms extended over the necks of both sovereigns and\r\npeople. It had become a mighty power in the world, inseparably\r\nconnected with the education and the religion of the age, the prime\r\nmover of all political affairs, the grand prop of absolute monarchies,\r\nthe last hope of the papal hierarchy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rapid Spread of the Jesuits.]\r\n\r\nThe sudden growth and enormous resources of the "Society of Jesus"\r\nimpress us with feelings of amazement and awe. We almost attribute\r\nthem to the agency of mysterious powers, and forget the operations of\r\nnatural causes. The history of society shows that no body of men ever\r\nobtained a wide-spread ascendency, except by the exercise of\r\nremarkable qualities of mind and heart. And this is the reason why the\r\nJesuits prospered. When Catholic Europe saw young men, born to fortune\r\nand honors, voluntarily surrendering their rank and goods, devoting\r\nthemselves to religious duties, spending their days in hospitals and\r\nschools, wandering, as missionaries, into the most unknown and\r\ndangerous parts of the world, exciting the young to study, making\r\ngreat attainments in all departments of literature and science, and\r\nshedding a light, wherever they went, by their genius and\r\ndisinterestedness, it was natural that they would be received as\r\npreachers, teachers, and confessors. That they were characterized,\r\nduring the first fifty years, by such excellencies, has never been\r\ndenied. The Jesuit missionary called forth the praises of Baxter, and\r\nthe panegyric of Leibnitz. He went forth, without fear, to encounter\r\nthe most dreaded dangers. Martyrdom was nothing to him, for he knew\r\nthat the altar, which might stream with his blood, would, in after\r\ntimes, be a cherished monument of his fame, and an impressive emblem\r\nof the power of his religion. Francis Xavier, one of the first\r\nconverts of Loyola, a Spaniard of rank, traversed a tract of more than\r\ntwice the circumference of the globe, preaching, disputing, and\r\nbaptizing, until seventy thousand converts attested the fruits of his\r\nmission. In perils, fastings, and fatigues, was the life of this\r\nremarkable man passed, to convert the heathen world; and his labors\r\nhave never been equalled, as a missionary, except by the apostle Paul.\r\nBut China and Japan were not the only scenes of the enterprises of\r\nJesuit missionaries. As early as 1634, they penetrated into Canada,\r\nand, shortly after to the sources of the Mississippi and the prairies\r\nof Illinois. "My companion," said the fearless Marquette, "is an envoy\r\nof France, to discover new countries; but I am an ambassador of God,\r\nto enlighten them with the gospel." But of all the missions of the\r\nJesuits, those in Paraguay were the most successful. They there\r\ngathered together, in _reductions_, or villages, three hundred\r\nthousand Indians, and these were bound together by a common interest,\r\nwere controlled by a paternal authority, taught useful arts, and\r\ntrained to enjoy the blessings of civilization. On the distant banks\r\nof the La Plata, while the Spanish colonists were hunting the Mexicans\r\nand Peruvians with bloodhounds, or the English slave traders were\r\nconsigning to eternal bondage the unhappy Africans, the Jesuits were\r\nrealizing the ideal paradise of More--a Utopia, where no murders or\r\nrobberies were committed, and where the blessed flowers of peace and\r\nharmony bloomed in a garden of almost primeval loveliness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extraordinary Virtues of the Older Jesuits.]\r\n\r\nIn that age, the Jesuit excelled in any work to which he devoted his\r\nattention. He was not only an intrepid missionary, but a most\r\nsuccessful teacher. Into the work of education he entered heart and\r\nsoul. He taught gratuitously, without any crabbed harshness, and with\r\na view to gain the heart. He entered into the feelings of his pupils,\r\nand taught them to subdue their tempers, and avoid quarrels and oaths.\r\nHe excited them to enthusiasm, perceived their merits, and rewarded\r\nthe successful with presents and favors. Hence the schools of the\r\nJesuits were the best in Europe, and were highly praised even by the\r\nProtestants. The Jesuits were even more popular as preachers than they\r\nwere as teachers; and they were equally prized as confessors. They\r\nwere so successful and so respected, that they soon obtained an\r\nascendency in Europe. Veneration secured wealth, and their\r\nestablishments gradually became magnificently endowed. But all their\r\ninfluence was directed to one single end--to the building up of the\r\npower of the popes, whose obedient servants they were. Can we wonder\r\nthat Catholicism should revive?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Constitution of the Jesuits.]\r\n\r\nAgain, their constitution was wonderful, and admirably adapted to the\r\nends they had in view. Their vows were indeed substantially the same\r\nas those of other monks, but there was among them a more practical\r\nspirit of obedience. All the members were controlled by a single\r\nwill--all were passive, instruments in the hands of the general of the\r\norder. He appointed presidents of colleges and of religious houses;\r\nadmitted, dismissed, dispensed, and punished at his pleasure. His\r\npower was irresponsible, and for life. From his will there was no\r\nappeal. There were among them many gradations in rank, but each\r\ngradation was a gradation in slavery. The Jesuit was bound to obey\r\neven his own servant, if required by a superior. Obedience was the\r\nsoul of the institution, absolute, unconditional, and unreserved--even\r\nthe submission of the will, to the entire abnegation of self. The\r\nJesuit gloried in being made a puppet, a piece of machinery, like a\r\nsoldier, if the loss of his intellectual independence would advance\r\nthe interests of his order. The _esprit de corps_ was perfectly\r\nwonderful, and this spirit was one secret of the disinterestedness of\r\nthe body. "_Ad majorem Dei gloriam,_" was the motto emblazoned on\r\ntheir standards, and written on their hearts; but this glory of God\r\nwas synonymous with the ascendency of their association.\r\n\r\nThe unconditional obedience to a single will, which is the genius of\r\nJesuitism, while it signally advanced the interests of the body, and\r\nof the pope, to whom they were devoted, still led to the most\r\ndetestable and resistless spiritual despotism ever exercised by man.\r\nThe Jesuit, especially when obscure and humble, was a tool, rather\r\nthan an intriguer. He was bound hand and foot by the orders of his\r\nsuperiors, and they alone were responsible for his actions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Degeneracy of the Jesuits.]\r\n\r\nWe can easily see how the extraordinary virtues and attainments of the\r\nearly Jesuits, and the wonderful mechanism of their system, would\r\npromote the growth of the order and the interests of Rome, before the\r\nsuspicions of good people would be aroused. It was a long time after\r\ntheir piety had passed to fraud, their simplicity to cunning, their\r\npoverty to wealth, their humility to pride, and their indifference to\r\nthe world to cabals, intrigues, and crimes, before the change was\r\nfelt. And, moreover, it was more than a century before the fruits of\r\nthe system were fully reaped. With all the excellences of their\r\nschools and missions, dangerous notions and customs were taught in\r\nthem, which gradually destroyed their efficacy. A bad system often\r\nworks well for a while, but always carries the seeds of decay and\r\nruin. It was so with the institution of Loyola, in spite of the\r\nenthusiasm and sincerity of the early members, and the masterly wisdom\r\ndisplayed by the founders. In after times, evils were perceived, which\r\nhad, at first, escaped the eye. It was seen that the system of\r\neducation, though specious, and, in many respects, excellent, was\r\ncalculated to narrow the mind, while it filled it with knowledge.\r\nYoung men, in their colleges, were taught blindly to follow a rigid\r\nmechanical code; they were closely watched; all books were taken from\r\nthem of a liberal tendency; mutilated editions of such as could not be\r\ndenied only were allowed; truths of great importance were concealed or\r\nglossed over; exploded errors were revived, and studies recommended\r\nwhich had no reference to the discussion of abstract questions on\r\ngovernment or religion. And the boys were made spies on each other,\r\ntheir spirits were broken, and their tastes perverted. The Jesuits\r\nsought to guard the avenues to thought, not to open them, were jealous\r\nof all independence of mind, and never sought to go beyond their age,\r\nor base any movement on ideal standards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evils in the Jesuit System.]\r\n\r\nAgain, as preachers, though popular and eloquent, they devoted their\r\ntalents to convert men to the _Roman church_ rather than to _God_.\r\nThey were bigoted sectarians; strove to make men Catholics rather than\r\nChristians. As missionaries, they were content with a mere nominal\r\nconversion. They gave men the crucifix, but not the Bible, and even\r\npermitted their converts to retain many of their ancient superstitions\r\nand prejudices. And thus they usurped the authority of native rulers,\r\nand sought to impose on China and Japan their despotic yoke. They\r\ngreatly enriched themselves in consequence of the credulity of the\r\nnatives, whom they flattered, and wielded an unlawful power. And this\r\nis one reason why they were expelled, and why they made no permanent\r\nconquests among the millions they converted in Japan. They wished not\r\nonly to subjugate the European, but the Asiatic mind. Europe did not\r\npresent a field sufficiently extensive for their cupidity and\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nFinally, as confessors, they were peculiarly indulgent to those who\r\nsought absolution, provided their submission was complete. Then it was\r\nseen what an easy thing it was to bear the yoke of Christ. The\r\noffender was told that sin consisted in wilfulness, and wilfulness in\r\nthe perfect knowledge of the nature of sin, according to which\r\ndoctrine blindness and passion were sufficient exculpations. They\r\ninvented the doctrine of mental reservation, on which Pascal was so\r\nsevere. Perjury was allowable, if the perjured were inwardly\r\ndetermined not to swear. A man might fight a duel, if in danger of\r\nbeing stigmatized as a coward; he might betray his friend, if he could\r\nthus benefit his party. The Jesuits invented a system of casuistry\r\nwhich confused all established ideas of moral obligation. They\r\ntolerated, and some of them justified, crimes, if the same could be\r\nmade subservient to the apparent interests of the church. Their\r\nprinciple was to do evil that good might come. Above all, they\r\nconformed to the inclinations of the great, especially to those of\r\nabsolute princes, on whom they imposed no painful penance, or austere\r\ndevotion. Their sympathies always were with absolutism, in all its\r\nforms and they were the chosen and trusted agents of the despots of\r\nmankind, until even the eyes of Europe were open to their vast\r\nambition, which sought to erect an independent empire within the\r\nlimits of despotism itself. But the corruptions of the Jesuits, their\r\nsystem of casuistry, their lax morality, their disgraceful intrigues,\r\ntheir unprincipled rapacity, do not belong to the age we have now been\r\nconsidering. These fruits of a bad system had not then been matured;\r\nand the infancy of the society was as beautiful as its latter days\r\nwere disgraceful and fearful. In a future chapter, we shall glance at\r\nthe decline and fall of this celebrated institution--the best adapted\r\nto its proposed ends of any system ever devised by the craft and\r\nwisdom of man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Popes in the Seventeenth Century.]\r\n\r\nThe great patrons of the Jesuits--the popes and their empire in the\r\nsixteenth century, after the death of Luther--demand some notice. The\r\nCatholic church, in this century, was remarkable for the reformation\r\nit attempted within its own body, and for the zeal, and ability, and\r\nvirtue, which marked the character of many of the popes themselves.\r\nHad it not been for this counter reformation, Protestantism would have\r\nobtained a great ascendency in Europe. But the Protestants were\r\ndivided among themselves, while the Catholics were united, and\r\nanimated with singular zeal. They put forth their utmost energies to\r\nreconquer what they had lost. They did not succeed in this, but they\r\nsecured the ascendency, on the whole, of the Catholic cause in Europe.\r\nFor this ascendency the popes are indebted to the Jesuits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nepotism of the Popes.]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the sixteenth century, the popes possessed a\r\nwell-situated, rich, and beautiful province. All writers celebrated\r\nits fertility. Scarcely a foot of land remained uncultivated. Corn was\r\nexported, and the ports were filled with ships. The people were\r\ncourageous, and had great talents for business. The middle classes\r\nwere peaceful and contented, but the nobles, who held in their hands\r\nthe municipal authority, were turbulent, rapacious, and indifferent to\r\nintellectual culture. The popes were generally virtuous characters,\r\nand munificent patrons of genius. Gregory\xc2\xa0XIII. kept a list of men in\r\nevery country who were likely to acquit themselves as bishops, and\r\nexhibited the greatest caution in appointing them. Sixtus\xc2\xa0V., whose\r\nfather was an humble gardener, encouraged agriculture and\r\nmanufactures, husbanded the resources of the state, and filled Rome\r\nwith statues. He raised the obelisk in front of St. Peter\'s, and\r\ncompleted the dome of the Cathedral. Clement\xc2\xa0VIII. celebrated the mass\r\nhimself, and scrupulously devoted himself to religious duties. He was\r\ncareless of the pleasures which formerly characterized the popes, and\r\nadmitted every day twelve poor persons to dine with him. Paul\xc2\xa0V. had\r\nequal talents and greater authority, but was bigoted and cold.\r\nGregory\xc2\xa0XIV. had all the severity of an ancient monk. The only\r\nreligious peculiarity of the popes, at the latter end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, which we unhesitatingly condemn, was, their religious\r\nintolerance. But they saw that their empire would pass away, unless\r\nthey used vigorous and desperate measures to retain it. During this\r\nperiod, the great victories of the Jesuits, the establishment of their\r\ncolleges, and the splendid endowments of their churches took place.\r\nGregory\xc2\xa0XV. built, at his own cost, the celebrated church of St.\r\nIgnatius, at Rome, and instituted the Propaganda, a missionary\r\ninstitution, under the control of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rome in the Seventeenth Century.]\r\n\r\nThe popes, whether good or bad, did not relinquish their nepotism in\r\nthis century, in consequence of which great families arose with every\r\npope, and supplanted the old aristocracy. The Barberini family, in one\r\npontificate, amassed one hundred and five millions of scudi--as great\r\na fortune as that left by Mazarin. But they, enriched under\r\nUrban\xc2\xa0VII., had to flee from Rome under Innocent\xc2\xa0X. Jealousy and\r\ncontention divided and distracted all the noble families, who vied\r\nwith each other in titles and pomp, ceremony and pride. The ladies of\r\nthe Savelli family never quitted their palace walls, except in closely\r\nveiled carriages. The Visconti decorated their walls with the\r\nportraits of the popes of their line. The Gaetana dwelt with pride on\r\nthe memory of Boniface\xc2\xa0VIII. The Colonna and Orsini boasted that for\r\ncenturies no peace had been concluded in Christendom, in which they\r\nhad not been expressly included. But these old families had become\r\ngradually impoverished, and yielded, in wealth and power, though not\r\nin pride and dignity, to the Cesarini, Borghesi, Aldobrandini,\r\nLudovisi, Giustiniani, Chigi, and the Barberini. All these families,\r\nfrom which popes had sprung, had splendid palaces, villas, pictures,\r\nlibraries, and statues; and they contributed to make Rome the centre\r\nof attraction for the elegant and the literary throughout Europe. It\r\nwas still the moral and social centre of Christendom. It was a place\r\nto which all strangers resorted, and from which all intrigues sprung.\r\nIt was the scene of pleasure, gayety, and grandeur. And the splendid\r\nfabric, which was erected in the "ages of faith," in spite of all the\r\ncalamities and ravages of time, remained still beautiful and\r\nattractive. Since the first secession, in the sixteenth century, Rome\r\nhas lost none of her adherents, and those, who remained faithful, have\r\nbecome the more enthusiastic in their idolatry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Ranke\'s History of the Popes.

They were, on the other hand,\r\ncontinued with still greater acrimony. Protestantism had been\r\nsuppressed in France, but not in Holland or Germany. In England, the\r\nstruggle was to continue, not between the Catholics and Protestants,\r\nbut between different parties among the Protestants themselves. In\r\nGermany, a long and devastating war of thirty years was to be carried\r\non before even religious liberty could be guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThis struggle is the most prominent event of the seventeenth century\r\nbefore the English Revolution, and was attended with the most\r\nimportant religious and political consequences. The event itself was\r\none of the chief political consequences of the Reformation. Indeed,\r\nall the events of this period either originated in, or became mixed up\r\nwith, questions of religion.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first agitation of the reform doctrines, the house of\r\nAustria devoted against their adherents the whole of its immense\r\npolitical power. Charles\xc2\xa0V. resolved to suppress Protestantism, and\r\nwould have perhaps succeeded, had it not been for the various wars\r\nwhich distracted his attention, and for the decided stand which the\r\nProtestant princes of Germany took respecting Luther and his\r\ndoctrines. As early as 1530, was formed the league of Smalcalde,\r\nheaded by the elector of Saxony, the most powerful of the German\r\nprinces, next to the archduke of Austria. The princes who formed this\r\nleague, resolved to secure to their subjects the free exercise of\r\ntheir religion, in spite of all opposition from the Catholic powers.\r\nBut hostilities did not commence until after Luther had breathed his\r\nlast. The Catholics gained a great victory at the battle of M\xc3\xbchlberg,\r\nwhen the Elector of Saxony was taken prisoner. With the treaty of\r\nSmalcalde, the freedom of Germany seemed prostrate forever, and the\r\npower of Austria reached its meridian. But the cause of liberty\r\nrevived under Maurice of Saxony, once its formidable enemy. All the\r\nfruits of victory were lost again in the congress of Passau, and the\r\ndiet of Augsburg, when an equitable peace seemed guaranteed to the\r\nProtestants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diet of Augsburg.]\r\n\r\nThe diet of Augsburg, 1555, the year of the resignation of Charles\xc2\xa0V.,\r\ndivided Germany into two great political and religious parties, and\r\nrecognized the independence of each. The Protestants were no longer\r\nlooked upon as rebels, but as men who had a right to worship God as\r\nthey pleased. Still, in reality, all that the Lutherans gained was\r\ntoleration, not equality. The concessions of the Catholics were made\r\nto necessity, not to justice. Hence, the treaty of Augsburg proved\r\nonly a truce, not a lasting peace. The boundaries of both parties were\r\nmarked out by the sword, and by the sword only were they to be\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nFor a while, however, peace was preserved, and might have continued\r\nlonger, had it not been for the dissensions of Protestants among\r\nthemselves, caused by the followers of Calvin and Luther. The\r\nLutherans would not include the Calvinists in their communion, and the\r\nCalvinists would not accede to the Lutheran church. During these\r\ndissensions, the Jesuits sowed tares, and the Protestants lost the\r\nchance of establishing their perfect equality with the Catholics.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the bitterness and jealousy which existed between\r\nsects and parties, still the peace of Germany, in a political sense,\r\nwas preserved during the reign of Ferdinand, the founder of the German\r\nbranch of the house of Austria, and who succeeded his brother\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0V. On his death, in 1564, his son Maximilian\xc2\xa0II., was chosen\r\nemperor, and during his reign, and until his death, in 1576, Germany\r\nenjoyed tranquillity. His successor was his son Rodolph, a weak\r\nprince, and incapable of uniting the various territories which were\r\nhereditary in his family--Austria, Hungary, Transylvania, Bohemia,\r\nMoravia, and Styria. There were troubles in each of these provinces,\r\nand one after another revolted, until Rodolph was left with but the\r\nempty title of emperor. But these provinces acknowledged the sway of\r\nhis brother Matthias, who had delivered them from the Turks, and had\r\ngranted the Protestants liberty of conscience. The emperor was weak\r\nenough to confirm his brother in his usurpation. In 1612, he died, and\r\nMatthias mounted the imperial throne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commencement of the Thirty Years War.]\r\n\r\nIt was during the reign of this prince, that the Thirty Years\' War\r\ncommenced. In proportion as the reformed religion gained ground in\r\nHungary and Bohemia,--two provinces very difficult to rule,--the\r\nProtestant princes of the empire became desirous of securing and\r\nextending their privileges. Their demands were refused, and they\r\nentered into a new confederacy, called the _Evangelical Union_. This\r\nassociation was opposed by another, called the _Catholic League_. The\r\nformer was supported by Holland, England, and Henry IV., of France.\r\nThe humiliation of Austria was the great object of Henry in supporting\r\nthe Protestant princes of Germany, and he assembled an army of forty\r\nthousand men, which he designed to head himself. But, just as his\r\npreparations were completed, he was assassinated, and his death and\r\nthe dissensions in the Austrian family prevented the war breaking out\r\nwith the fury which afterwards characterized it.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Matthias died in 1618, and was succeeded by his cousin\r\nFerdinand, Duke of Styria, who was an inveterate enemy to the\r\nProtestant cause. His first care was to suppress the insurrection of\r\nthe Protestants, which, just before his accession had broken out in\r\nBohemia, under the celebrated Count Mansfeldt. The Bohemians renounced\r\nallegiance to Ferdinand\xc2\xa0II., and chose Frederic\xc2\xa0V., elector palatine,\r\nfor their king. Frederic unwisely accepted the crown, which confirmed\r\nthe quarrel between Ferdinand and the Bohemians. Frederic was seconded\r\nby all the Protestant princes, except the Elector of Saxony, by two\r\nthousand four hundred English volunteers, and by eight thousand troops\r\nfrom the United Provinces. But Ferdinand, assisted by the king of\r\nSpain and all the Catholic princes, was more than a match for\r\nFrederic, who wasted his time and strength in vain displays of\r\nsovereignty. Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria, commanded the forces of the\r\nCatholics, who, with twenty-five thousand troops from the Low\r\nCountries, invaded Bohemia. The Bohemian forces did not amount to\r\nthirty thousand, but they intrenched themselves near Prague, where\r\nthey were attacked (1620) and routed, with immense slaughter. The\r\nbattle of Prague decided the fate of Bohemia, put Frederic in\r\npossession of all his dominions, and invested him with an authority\r\nequal to what any of his predecessors had enjoyed. All his wishes were\r\ngratified, and, had he been wise, he might have maintained his\r\nascendency in Germany. But he was blinded by his success, and, from a\r\nrebellion in Bohemia, the war extended through Germany, and afterwards\r\nthroughout Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Emperor Frederic.]\r\n\r\nThe emperor had regained his dominions by the victorious arms of\r\nMaximilian, Duke of Bavaria. To compensate him, without detriment to\r\nhimself, he resolved to bestow upon him the dominions of the Count\r\nPalatine of the Rhine, who had injudiciously accepted the crown of\r\nBohemia. Frederic must be totally ruined. He was put under the ban of\r\nthe empire, and his territories were devastated by the Spanish general\r\nSpinola, with an army of twenty-five thousand men.\r\n\r\nApparently there was no hope for Frederic, or the Protestant cause.\r\nThe only Protestant princes capable of arresting the Austrian\r\nencroachments were the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg. But the\r\nformer, John George, preferred the aggrandizement of his house to the\r\nemancipation of his country, and tamely witnessed the victories of the\r\nemperor, without raising an arm for the relief of the Protestants, of\r\nwhom he was the acknowledged head. George William of Brandenburg was\r\nstill more shamefully fettered by the fear of Austria, and of losing\r\nhis dominions; and he, too, cautiously avoided committing himself to\r\neither party.\r\n\r\nBut while these two great princes ingloriously abandoned Frederic to\r\nhis fate, a single soldier of fortune, whose only treasure was his\r\nsword, Ernest Count Mansfield, dared, in the Bohemian town of Pilsen,\r\nto defy the whole power of Austria. Undismayed by the reverses of the\r\nelector palatine, he succeeded in enlisting an army of twenty thousand\r\nmen. With such an army, the cause of Frederic was not irretrievably\r\nlost. New prospects began to open, and his misfortunes raised up\r\nunexpected friends. James of England opened his treasures, and\r\nChristian of Denmark offered his powerful support. Mansfeldt was also\r\njoined by the Margrave of Baden. The courage of the count palatine\r\nrevived, and he labored assiduously to arouse his Protestant brethren.\r\nMeanwhile, the generals of the emperor were on the alert, and the\r\nrising hopes of Frederic were dissipated by the victories of Tilly.\r\nThe count palatine was again driven from his hereditary dominions, and\r\nsought refuge in Holland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Count Wallenstein.]\r\n\r\nBut, though the emperor was successful, his finances were exhausted,\r\nand he was disagreeably dependent on Bavaria. Under his circumstances,\r\nnothing was more welcome than the proposal of Wallenstein, an\r\nexperienced officer, and the richest nobleman in Bohemia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Wallenstein.]\r\n\r\nHe offered, at his own expense, and that of his friends, to raise,\r\nclothe, and maintain an army for the emperor, if he were allowed to\r\naugment it to fifty thousand men. His project was ridiculed as\r\nvisionary; but the offer was too valuable to be rejected. In a few\r\nmonths, he had collected an army of thirty thousand. His reputation,\r\nthe prospect of promotion, and the hope of plunder, attracted\r\nadventurers from all parts of Germany. Knowing that so large a body\r\ncould not be held together without great resources, and having none of\r\nhis own, he marched his troops into the most fertile territories,\r\nwhich had not yet suffered from the war, where they subsisted by\r\ncontributions and plunder, as obnoxious to their friends as they were\r\nto their enemies. Nothing shows the weakness of the imperial power,\r\nwith all its apparent strength, and the barbarous notions and customs\r\nof the country, more than this grant to Wallenstein. And, with all his\r\nheroism and success, he cannot now be viewed in any other light than\r\nas a licensed robber. He was virtually at the head of a troop of\r\nbanditti, who fought for the sake of plunder, and who would join any\r\nside which would present the greatest hopes of gain. The genius of\r\nSchiller, both in his dramas and histories, has immortalized the name\r\nof this unprincipled hero, and has excited a strange interest in his\r\nperson, his family, and his fortunes. He is represented as "born to\r\ncommand. His acute eye distinguished at a glance, from among the\r\nmultitude, such as were competent, and he assigned to each his proper\r\nplace. His praise, from being rarely bestowed, animated and brought\r\ninto full operation every faculty; while his steady, reserved, and\r\nearnest demeanor secured obedience and discipline. His very appearance\r\nexcited awe and reverence; his figure was proud, lofty, and warlike,\r\nwhile his bright, piercing eye expressed profundity of thought,\r\ncombined with gravity and mystery. His favorite study was that of the\r\nstars, and his most intimate friend was an Italian astrologer. He had\r\na fondness for pomp and extravagance. He maintained sixty pages; his\r\nante-chamber was guarded by fifty life-guards, and his table never\r\nconsisted of less than one hundred covers. Six barons and as many\r\nknights were in constant attendance on his person. He never smiled,\r\nand the coldness of his temperament was proof against sensual\r\nseductions. Ever occupied with grand schemes, he despised those\r\namusements in which so many waste their lives. Terror was the talisman\r\nwith which he worked: extreme in his punishments as in his rewards, he\r\nknew how to keep alive the zeal of his followers, while no general of\r\nancient or modern times could boast of being obeyed with equal\r\nalacrity. Submission to his will was more prized by him than bravery,\r\nand he kept up the obedience of his troops by capricious orders. He\r\nwas a man of large stature, thin, of a sallow complexion, with short,\r\nred hair, and small, sparkling eyes. A gloomy and forbidding\r\nseriousness sat upon his brow, and his munificent presents alone\r\nretained the trembling crowd of his dependants."\r\n\r\nSuch was this enterprising nobleman, to whom the emperor Ferdinand\r\ncommitted so great authority. And the success of Wallenstein\r\napparently justified the course of the emperor. The greater his\r\nextortions, and the greater his rewards, the greater was the concourse\r\nto his standard. Such is human nature. It is said that, in seven\r\nyears, Wallenstein exacted not less than sixty millions of dollars\r\nfrom one half of Germany--an incredible sum, when the expenditure of\r\nthe government of England, at this time, was less than two million\r\npounds a year. His armies flourished, while the states through which\r\nthey passed were ruined. What cared he for the curses of the people,\r\nor the complaints of princes, so long as his army adored him? It was\r\nhis object to humble all the princes of the empire, and make himself\r\nso necessary to the emperor that he would gradually sink to become his\r\ntool. He already was created Duke of Friedland, and generalissimo of\r\nthe imperial armies. Nor had his victorious career met with any severe\r\ncheck, but uninterrupted success seemed to promise the realization of\r\nhis vast ambition. Germany lay bleeding at his feet, helpless and\r\nindignant.\r\n\r\nBut the greatness and the insolence of Wallenstein raised up enemies\r\nagainst him in all parts of the empire. Fear and jealousy increased\r\nthe opposition, even in the ranks of the Catholics. His dismissal was\r\ndemanded by the whole college of electors, and even by Spain.\r\nMaximilian, Duke of Bavaria, felt himself eclipsed by the successful\r\ngeneral, and was at the head of the cabals against him.\r\n\r\nThe emperor felt, at this crisis, as Ganganelli did when compelled to\r\ndisband the Jesuits, that he was parting with the man to whom he owed\r\nall his supremacy. Long was he undecided whether or not he would make\r\nthe sacrifice. But all Germany was clamorous, and the disgrace of\r\nWallenstein was ordained.\r\n\r\nWould the ambitious chieftain, at the head of one hundred thousand\r\ndevoted soldiers, regard the commands of the emperor? He made up his\r\nmind to obey, looking to the future for revenge, and feeling that he\r\ncould afford to wait for it. Seni had read in the stars that glorious\r\nprospects still awaited him. Wallenstein retired to his estates in\r\nBohemia, but maintained the pomp and splendor of a prince of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gustavus Adolphus.]\r\n\r\nScarcely had he retired from the command of the army before his\r\nservices were again demanded. One hero produces another. A Wellington\r\nis ever found to oppose a Napoleon. Providence raised up a friend to\r\nGermany, in its distress, in the person of Gustavus Adolphus, King of\r\nSweden. It was not for personal aggrandizement that he lent his\r\npowerful arm to the Protestant princes, who, thus far, had vainly\r\nstruggled against Maximilian, Tilly, and Wallenstein. Zeal for\r\nProtestantism, added to strong provocations, induced him to land in\r\nGermany with fifteen thousand men--a small body to oppose the\r\nvictorious troops of the emperor, but they were brave and highly\r\ndisciplined, and devoted to their royal master. He himself was\r\nindisputably the greatest general of the age, and had the full\r\nconfidence of the Protestant princes, who were ready to rally the\r\nmoment he obtained any signal advantage. Henceforth, Gustavus Adolphus\r\nwas the hero of the war. He was more than a hero; he was a Christian,\r\nregardful of the morals of his soldiers, and devoted to the interests\r\nof spiritual religion. He was frugal, yet generous, serene in the\r\ngreatest danger; and magnanimous beyond all precedent in the history\r\nof kings. On the 20th of May, 1630, taking his daughter Christiana in\r\nhis arms, then only four years of age, he presented her to the states\r\nas their future sovereign, and made his farewell address. "Not\r\nlightly, not wantonly," said he, "am I about to involve myself and you\r\nin this new and dangerous war. God is my witness that I do not fight\r\nto gratify my own ambition; but the emperor has wronged me, has\r\nsupported my enemies, persecuted my friends, trampled my religion in\r\nthe dust, and even stretched forth his revengeful arm against my\r\ncrown. The oppressed states of Germany call loudly for aid, which, by\r\nGod\'s help, we will give them.\r\n\r\n"I am fully sensible of the dangers to which my life will be exposed.\r\nI have never yet shrunk from them, nor is it likely that I shall\r\nalways escape them. Hitherto, Providence has protected me; but I shall\r\nat last fall in defence of my country and my faith. I commend you to\r\nthe protection of Heaven. Be just, conscientious, and upright, and we\r\nshall meet again in eternity. For the prosperity of all my subjects, I\r\noffer my warmest prayer to Heaven; and bid you all a sincere--it may\r\nbe an eternal--farewell."\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely landed in Germany before his victorious career began.\r\nFrance concluded a treaty with him, and he advanced against Tilly, who\r\nnow headed the imperial armies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loss of Magdeburg.]\r\n\r\nThe tardiness of the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg in rendering\r\nassistance caused the loss of Magdeburg, the most important fortress\r\nof the Protestants. It was taken by assault, even while Gustavus was\r\nadvancing to its relief. No pen can paint, and no imagination can\r\nconceive, the horrors which were perpetrated by the imperial soldiers\r\nin the sack of that unfortunate place. Neither childhood nor helpless\r\nage--neither youth, beauty, sex, nor rank could disarm the fury of the\r\nconquerors. No situation or retreat was sacred. In a single church\r\nfifty-three women were beheaded. The Croats amused themselves with\r\nthrowing children into the flames. Pappenheim\'s Walloons stabbed\r\ninfants at the breast. The city was reduced to ashes, and thirty\r\nthousand of the inhabitants were slain.\r\n\r\nBut the loss of this important city was soon compensated by the battle\r\nof Leipsic, 1630, which the King of Sweden gained over the imperial\r\nforces, and in which the Elector of Saxony at last rendered valuable\r\naid. The rout of Tilly, hitherto victorious, was complete, and he\r\nhimself escaped only by chance. Saxony was freed from the enemy, while\r\nBohemia, Moravia, Austria, and Hungary, were stripped of their\r\ndefenders. Ferdinand was no longer secure in his capital; the freedom\r\nof Germany was secured. Gustavus was every where hailed as a\r\ndeliverer, and admiration for his genius was only equalled by the\r\nadmiration of his virtues. He rapidly regained all that the\r\nProtestants had lost, and the fruits of twelve years of war were\r\nsnatched away from the emperor. Tilly was soon after killed, and all\r\nthings indicated the complete triumph of the Protestants.\r\n\r\nIt was now the turn of Ferdinand to tremble. The only person who could\r\nsave him was dismissed and disgraced. Tilly was dead. Munich and\r\nPrague were in the hands of the Protestants, while the king of Sweden\r\ntraversed Germany as a conqueror, law giver, and judge. No fortress\r\nwas inaccessible; no river checked his victorious career. The Swedish\r\nstandards were planted in Bavaria, Bohemia, the Palatinate, Saxony,\r\nand along the banks of the Rhine. Meanwhile the Turks were preparing\r\nto attack Hungary, and a dangerous insurrection threatened his own\r\ncapital. None came to his assistance in the hour of peril. On all\r\nsides, he was surrounded by hostile armies, while his own forces were\r\ndispirited and treacherous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wallenstein Reinstated in Power.]\r\n\r\nFrom such a hopeless state he was rescued by the man whom he had\r\ninjured, but not until he had himself to beg his assistance.\r\nWallenstein was in retirement, and secretly rejoiced in the victories\r\nof the Swedish king, knowing full well that the emperor would soon be\r\ncompelled to summon him again to command his armies. Now he could\r\ndictate his terms. Now he could humiliate his sovereign, and at the\r\nsame time obtain all the power his ambition craved. He declined\r\nentering his service unless he had the unlimited command of all the\r\narmies of Austria and Spain. No commission in the army was to be\r\ngranted by the emperor, without his own approval. He demanded the\r\nordinary pay, and an imperial hereditary estate. In short, he demanded\r\nsovereign authority; and with such humiliating terms the emperor, in\r\nhis necessities, was obliged to comply.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Gustavus Adolphus.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner did he raise his standard, than it was resorted to by the\r\nunprincipled, the rapacious, and the needy from all parts of the\r\nempire. But Wallenstein now resolved to pursue, exclusively, his own\r\nselfish interests, and directed all his aims to independent\r\nsovereignty. When his forces were united with those of Maximilian, he\r\nfound himself at the head of sixty thousand men. Then really commenced\r\nthe severity of the contest, for Wallenstein was now stronger than\r\nGustavus. Nevertheless, the heroic Swede offered to give his rival\r\nbattle at Nuremburg, which was declined. He then attacked his camp,\r\nbut was repulsed with loss. At last, the two generals met on the\r\nplains of Lutzen, in Saxony, 1632. During the whole course of the war,\r\ntwo such generals had not been pitted against each other, nor had so\r\nmuch been staked on the chance of a battle. Victory declared for the\r\ntroops of Gustavus, but the heroic leader himself was killed, in the\r\nfulness of his glory. It was his fortune to die with an untarnished\r\nfame. "By an untimely death," says Schiller, "his protecting genius\r\nrescued him from the inevitable fate of man--that of forgetting\r\nmoderation in the intoxication of success, and justice in the\r\nplenitude of power. It may be doubted whether, had he lived longer, he\r\nwould still have deserved the tears which Germany shed over his grave,\r\nor maintained his title to the admiration with which posterity regards\r\nhim,--as the first and only just conqueror that the world has\r\nproduced. But it was no longer the benefactor of Germany who fell at\r\nLutzen; the beneficent part of his career Gustavus Adolphus had\r\nalready terminated; and now the greatest service which he could render\r\nto the liberties of Germany was--to die. The all-engrossing power of\r\nan individual was at an end; the equivocal assistance of an\r\nover-powerful protector gave place to a more noble self-exertion on\r\nthe part of the estates; and those who formerly were the mere\r\ninstruments of his aggrandizement, now began to work for themselves.\r\nThe ambition of the Swedish monarch aspired, unquestionably, to\r\nestablish a power within Germany inconsistent with the liberties of\r\nthe estates. His aim was the imperial crown; and this dignity,\r\nsupported by his power, would be liable to more abuse than had ever\r\nbeen feared from the house of Austria. His sudden disappearance\r\nsecured the liberties of Germany, and saved his own reputation, while\r\nit probably spared him the mortification of seeing his own allies in\r\narms against him, and all the fruits of his victories torn from him by\r\na disadvantageous peace."\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Lutzen we almost lose sight of Wallenstein, and no\r\nvictories were commensurate with his reputation and abilities. He\r\ncontinued inactive in Bohemia, while all Europe was awaiting the\r\nexploits which should efface the remembrance of his defeat. He\r\nexhausted the imperial provinces by enormous contributions, and his\r\nwhole conduct seems singular and treacherous. His enemies at the\r\nimperial court now renewed their intrigues, and his conduct was\r\nreviewed with the most malicious criticism. But he possessed too great\r\npower to be openly assailed by the emperor, and measures were\r\nconcerted to remove him by treachery. Wallenstein obtained notice of\r\nthe designs against him, and now, too late, resolved on an open\r\nrevolt. But he was betrayed, and his own generals, on whom he counted,\r\ndeserted him, so soon as the emperor dared to deprive him of his\r\ncommand. But he was only removed by assassination, and just at the\r\nmoment when he deemed himself secure against the whole power of the\r\nemperor. No man, however great, can stand before an authority which is\r\nuniversally deemed legitimate, however reduced and weakened that\r\nauthority may be. In times of anarchy and revolution, there is\r\nconfusion in men\'s minds respecting the persons in whom legitimate\r\nauthority should be lodged, and this is the only reason why rebellion\r\nis ever successful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assassination of Wallenstein.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Westphalia.]\r\n\r\nThe death of Wallenstein, in 1634, did not terminate the war. It raged\r\neleven years longer, with various success, and involved the other\r\nEuropean powers. France was then governed by Cardinal Richelieu, who,\r\nnotwithstanding his Catholicism, lent assistance to the Protestants,\r\nwith a view of reducing the power of Austria. Indeed, the war had\r\ndestroyed the sentiments which produced it, and political motives\r\nbecame stronger than religious. Oxenstiern and Richelieu became the\r\nmaster spirits of the contest, and, in the recesses of their cabinets,\r\nregulated the campaigns of their generals. Battles were lost and won\r\non both sides, and innumerable intrigues were plotted by interested\r\nstatesmen. After all parties had exhausted their resources, and\r\nGermany was deluged with the blood of Spaniards, Hollanders,\r\nFrenchmen, Swedes, besides that of her own sons, the peace of\r\nWestphalia was concluded, (1648,)--the most important treaty in the\r\nhistory of Europe. All the princes and states of the empire were\r\nre\xc3\xabstablished in the lands, rights, and prerogatives which they\r\nenjoyed before the troubles in Bohemia, in 1619. The religious\r\nliberties of the Lutherans and Calvinists were guaranteed, and it was\r\nstipulated that the Imperial Chamber should consist of twenty-four\r\nProtestant members and twenty-six Catholic, and that the emperor\r\nshould receive six Protestants into the Aulic Council, the highest\r\njudicial tribunal in the empire. This peace is the foundation of the\r\nwhole system of modern European politics, of all modern treaties, of\r\nthat which is called the freedom of Germany, and of a sort of balance\r\nof power among all the countries of Western Europe. Dearly was it\r\npurchased, by the perfect exhaustion of national energies, and the\r\ndemoralizing sentiments which one of the longest and bloodiest wars in\r\nhuman history inevitably introduced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Schiller\'s History of the Thirty Years\' War.\r\n     Russell\'s Modern Europe.

The energetic genius of Cardinal\r\nRichelieu, during the whole period of the thirty years\' war, affected\r\nthe councils of all the different courts of Europe. He was\r\nindisputably the greatest statesman of his age and nation. To him\r\nFrance is chiefly indebted for the ascendency she enjoyed in the\r\nseventeenth century. Had Henry\xc2\xa0IV. lived to the age of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV.,\r\nFrance would probably have been permanently greater, although the\r\npower of the king might not have been so absolute.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regency of Mary de Medicis.]\r\n\r\nWhen Henry\xc2\xa0IV. died, he left his kingdom to his son Louis\xc2\xa0XIII., a\r\nchild nine years of age. The first thing to be done was the\r\nappointment of a regent. The Parliament of Paris, in whom this right\r\nseems to have been vested, nominated the queen mother, Mary de\r\nMedicis, and the young king, in a bed of justice,--the greatest of the\r\nroyal prerogatives,--confirmed his mother in the regency. Her regency\r\nwas any thing but favorable to the interests of the kingdom. The\r\npolicy of the late king was disregarded, and a new course of measures\r\nwas adopted. Sully, through whose counsels the reign of Henry\xc2\xa0IV. had\r\nbeen so beneficent, was dismissed. The queen regent had no sympathy\r\nwith his views. Neither the corrupt court nor the powerful aristocracy\r\ncared any thing for the interests of the people, for the improvement\r\nof agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, for the regulation of the\r\nfinances, or for increasing the productive industry of the country, on\r\nwhich its material prosperity ever depends. The greedy courtiers\r\nobtained from a lavish queen the treasures which the wise care of\r\nHenry had amassed, and which he thoughtlessly bestowed in order to\r\nsecure their fidelity. The foreign policy also was changed, and a\r\nstrong alliance was made with the pope, with Spain, and with the\r\nJesuits.\r\n\r\nOn the retirement of the able and incorruptible Sully, favorites of no\r\ntalent or worth arose to power. Concini, an Italian, controlled the\r\nqueen regent, and through him all her favors flowed. He was succeeded\r\nby Luynes, a mere falconer, who made himself agreeable to the young\r\nking, and usurped the power of Concini, when the king attained his\r\nmajority. He became constable of France, the highest officer in the\r\nrealm, and surpassed all the old nobility in arrogance and cupidity.\r\nHis mismanagement and selfishness led to an insurrection of some of\r\nthe great nobles among whom were Cond\xc3\xa9 and D\'\xc3\x89pernon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of Cardinal de Richelieu.]\r\n\r\nWhile the kingdom was thus convulsed with civil war, and in every way\r\nmismanaged, Richelieu, Bishop of Lu\xc3\xa7on, appeared upon the stage. He\r\nwas a man of high birth, was made doctor of the Sorbonne at the age of\r\ntwenty-two, and, before he was twenty-five, a bishop. During the\r\nascendency of Mancini, he attracted the attention of the queen, and\r\nwas selected as secretary of state. Soon after the death of Luynes, he\r\nobtained a cardinal\'s hat, and a seat in the council. The moment he\r\nspoke, his genius predominated, and the monarch, with all his pride,\r\nbowed to the ascendency of intellect, and yielded, with a good grace,\r\nto a man whom it was impolitic to resist.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, in 1622, the reins of empire were in the hands of a\r\nmaster, and the king himself, were it not for the splendor of his\r\ncourt, would have disappeared from the eye, both of statesmen and\r\nhistorians. The reign of anarchy, for a quarter of a century, at\r\nleast, was over, and the way was prepared for the aggrandizement of\r\nthe French monarchy. When Richelieu came into power, universal\r\ndisorder prevailed. The finances were deranged, the Huguenots were\r\ntroublesome, and the nobles were rebellious. Such was the internal\r\nstate of France,--weakened, distracted, and anarchical. She had lost\r\nher position among the great powers, and Austria threatened to\r\noverturn the political relations of all the states of Europe. Austria,\r\nin the early part of the seventeenth century, was, unquestionably, the\r\nleading power in Christendom, and her ascendency boded no good to the\r\nliberties which men were beginning to assert.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suppression of the Huguenots.]\r\n\r\nThree great objects animated the genius of Richelieu, and in the\r\nattainment of these he was successful. These were, the suppression of\r\nthe Huguenots, as a powerful party, the humiliation of the great\r\nbarons, and the reduction of the power of Austria. For these objects\r\nhe perseveringly contended for twenty years; and his struggles and\r\nintrigues to secure these ends constitute the history of France during\r\nthe reign of Louis\xc2\xa0XIII. And they affected not only France, but the\r\nwhole continent. His policy was to preserve peace with England and\r\nSpain,--the hereditary enemies of France,--with Sweden, and with the\r\nProtestants of Germany, even while he suppressed their religion within\r\nhis own realm. It was the true policy of England to prevent the ruin\r\nof the Huguenots in France, as before she had aided the Protestants in\r\nHolland. But, unfortunately, England was then ruled by James and\r\nCharles, and they were controlled by profligate ministers, who were\r\nthe tools of the crafty cardinal. A feeble assistance was rendered by\r\nJames, but it availed nothing.\r\n\r\nIn order to annihilate the political power of the Huguenots,--for\r\nRichelieu cared more for this than for their religious opinions,--it\r\nwas necessary that he should possess himself of the city of La\r\nRochelle, on the Bay of Biscay, a strong fortress, which had resisted,\r\nduring the reign of Charles\xc2\xa0IX., the whole power of the Catholics, and\r\nwhich continued to be the stronghold of the Huguenots. Here they could\r\nalways retire and be safe, in times of danger. It was strongly\r\nfortified by sea, as well as by land; and only a vigorous blockade\r\ncould exclude provisions and military stores from the people. But\r\nEngland was mistress of the ocean, and supplies from her would always\r\nrelieve the besieged.\r\n\r\nAfter ineffectual but vigorous attempts to take the city by land,\r\nRichelieu determined to shut up its harbor, first by stakes, and then\r\nby a boom. Both of these measures failed. But the military genius of\r\nthe cardinal was equal to his talents as a statesman. He remembered\r\nwhat Alexander did at the siege of Tyre. So, with a volume of Quintus\r\nCurtius in his hand, he projected and finished a mole, half a mile in\r\nlength, across a gulf, into which the tide flowed. In some places, it\r\nwas eight hundred and forty feet below the surface of the water, and\r\nsixty feet in breadth. At first, the besieged laughed at an attempt so\r\ngigantic and difficult. But the work steadily progressed, and the city\r\nwas finally cut off from communication with the sea. The besieged,\r\nwasted by famine, surrendered; the fortifications were destroyed, the\r\ntown lost its independence, and the power of the Huguenots was broken\r\nforever. But no vengeance was taken on the heroic citizens, and they\r\nwere even permitted to enjoy their religion. Fifteen thousand,\r\nhowever, perished at this memorable siege.\r\n\r\nThe next object of Richelieu was the humiliation of Austria. But the\r\ndetail of his military operations would be complicated and tedious,\r\nsince no grand and decisive battles were fought by his generals, and\r\nno able commanders appeared. Turenne and Cond\xc3\xa9 belonged to the next\r\nage. The military operations consisted in frontier skirmishes, idle\r\nsieges, and fitful expeditions, in which, however, the cardinal had\r\nthe advantage, and by which he gained, since he could better afford to\r\npay for them. War is always ruinously expensive, and that party\r\ngenerally is successful which can the longer furnish resources. It is\r\na proof that religious bigotry did not mainly influence him, since he\r\nsupported the Protestant party. All motives of a religious kind were\r\nabsorbed in his prevailing passion to aggrandize the French monarchy.\r\nHad it not been for the intrigues and forces of Richelieu, the peace\r\nof Westphalia might not have been secured, and Austria might again\r\nhave overturned the "Balance of Power."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Depression of the Great Nobles.]\r\n\r\nThe third great aim of the minister, and the one which he most\r\nsystematically pursued to the close of his life, was the depression of\r\nthe nobles, whose power was dangerously exercised. They had almost\r\nfeudal privileges, were enormously wealthy, numerous, corrupt, and\r\ndissolute. His efforts to suppress their power raised up numerous\r\nconspiracies.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest was one supported by the queen mother and Gaston,\r\nDuke of Orleans, brother to the king, and presumptive heir to the\r\nthrone. Connected with this conspiracy were the Dukes of Bourbon and\r\nVendome, the Prince de Chalais, and several others of the highest\r\nrank. It was intended to assassinate the cardinal and seize the reins\r\nof government. But he got timely notice of the plot, informed the\r\nking, and guarded himself. The conspirators were too formidable to be\r\npunished in a body; so he dissembled and resolved to cut them off in\r\ndetail. He moreover threatened the king with resignation, and\r\nfrightened him by predicting a civil war. In consequence, the king\r\ngave orders to arrest his brothers, the Dukes of Bourbon and Vendome,\r\nwhile the Prince of Chalais was executed. The Duke of Orleans, on the\r\nconfession of Chalais, fled from the kingdom. The queen mother was\r\narrested, Bassompierre was imprisoned in the Bastile, and the Duke of\r\nGuise sent on a pilgrimage to Rome. The powerful D\'\xc3\x89pernon sued for\r\npardon.\r\n\r\nStill Richelieu was not satisfied. He resolved to humble the\r\nparliament, because it had opposed an ordinance of the king declaring\r\nthe partisans of the Duke of Orleans guilty of treason. It had rightly\r\nargued that such a condemnation could not be issued without a trial.\r\n"But," said the artful minister to the weak-minded king, "to refuse to\r\nverify a declaration which you yourself announced to the members of\r\nparliament, is to doubt your authority." An extraordinary council was\r\nconvened, and the parliament, which was simply a court of judges, was\r\nsummoned to the royal presence. They went in solemn procession,\r\ncarrying with them the record which showed their refusal to register\r\nthe edict. The king received them with stately pomp. They were\r\nrequired to kneel in his presence, and their decree was taken from the\r\nrecord and torn in pieces before their eyes, and the leading members\r\nwere suspended and banished.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Aids, by whom the money edicts were registered, also\r\nshowed opposition. The members left the court when the next edict was\r\nto be registered. But they were suspended, until they humbly came to\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n"All the malcontents, the queen, the prince, the nobles, the\r\nparliament, and the Court of Aids hoped for the support of the people,\r\nand all were disappointed." And this is the reason why they failed and\r\nRichelieu triumphed. There never have been, among the French,\r\ndisinterestedness and union in the cause of liberty, which never can\r\nbe gained without perseverance and self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe next usurpation of Richelieu was the erection of a new tribunal\r\nfor trying state criminals, in which no record of its proceedings\r\nshould be preserved, and the members of which should be selected by\r\nhimself. This court was worse than that of the Star Chamber.\r\n\r\nRichelieu showed a still more culpable disregard of the forms of\r\njustice in the trial of Marshal Marrillac, charged with crimes in the\r\nconduct of the army. He was brought before a commission, and not\r\nbefore his peers, condemned, and executed.\r\n\r\nIn view of this judicial murder, the nobles, generally, were filled\r\nwith indignation and alarm. They now saw that the minister aimed at\r\nthe complete humiliation of their order, and therefore made another\r\neffort to resist the cardinal. At the head of this conspiracy was the\r\nDuke of Montmorency, admiral and constable of France, one of the most\r\npowerful nobles in the kingdom. He was governor of Provence, and\r\ndeeply resented the insult offered to his rank in the condemnation of\r\nMarrillac. He moreover felt indignant that the king\'s brother should\r\nbe driven into exile by the hostility of a priest. He therefore joined\r\nhis forces with those of the Duke of Orleans, was defeated, tried, and\r\nexecuted for rebellion, against the entreaty and intercession of the\r\nmost powerful families.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Power of Richelieu.]\r\n\r\nThe cardinal minister was now triumphant over all his enemies. He had\r\ndestroyed the political power of the Huguenots, extended the boundary\r\nof France, and decimated the nobles. He now turned his attention to\r\nthe internal administration of the kingdom. He created a national\r\nnavy, protected commerce and industry, rewarded genius, and formed the\r\nFrench Academy. He attained a greater pitch of greatness than any\r\nsubject ever before or since enjoyed in his country, greater even than\r\nwas possessed by Wolsey. Wolsey, powerful as he was, lived, like a\r\nTurkish vizier, in constant fear of his capricious master. But\r\nRichelieu controlled the king himself. Louis\xc2\xa0XIII. feared him, and\r\nfelt that he could not reign without him. He did not love the\r\ncardinal, and was often tempted to dismiss him, but could never summon\r\nsufficient resolution. Richelieu was more powerful than the queen\r\nmother, the brothers of the king, the royal mistresses, or even all\r\nunited, since he obtained an ascendency over all, doomed the queen\r\nmother to languish in exile at Cologne, and compelled the duke of\r\nOrleans to succumb to him. He was chief of three of the principal\r\nmonastic orders, and possessed enormous wealth. He erected a palace as\r\ngrand as Hampton Court, and appeared in public with great pomp and\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Richelieu.]\r\n\r\nBut an end came to his greatness. In 1642, a mortal malady wasted him\r\naway; he summoned to his death bed his royal master; recommended\r\nMazarin as his successor; and died like a man who knew no remorse, in\r\nthe fifty-eighth year of his age, and the eighteenth of his reign as\r\nminister. He was eloquent, but his words served only to disguise his\r\nsentiments; he was direct and frank in his speech, and yet a perfect\r\nmaster of the art of dissimulation; he could not be imposed upon, and\r\nyet was passionately fond of flattery, which he liked in such large\r\ndoses that it seemed hyperbolical; he was not learned, yet appreciated\r\nlearning in others, and magnificently rewarded it; he was fond of\r\npleasure, and easily fascinated by women, and yet was cold, politic,\r\nimplacable, and cruel. But he was a great statesman, and aimed to\r\nsuppress anarchy and preserve law. In view of his labors to preserve\r\norder, we may almost excuse his severity. "Placed," says Montr\xc3\xa9sor, as\r\nquoted by Miss Pardoe, "at an equal distance between Louis\xc2\xa0IX., whose\r\naim was to abolish feudality, and the national convention, whose\r\nattempt was to crush aristocracy, he appeared, like them, to have\r\nreceived a mission of blood from heaven." The high nobility, repulsed\r\nunder Louis\xc2\xa0XI. and Francis\xc2\xa0I., almost entirely succumbed under\r\nRichelieu, preparing, by its overthrow, the calm, unitarian, and\r\ndespotic reign of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., who looked around him in vain for a\r\ngreat noble, and found only courtiers. The great rebellion, which, for\r\nnearly two centuries, agitated France, almost entirely disappeared\r\nunder the ministry of the cardinal. The Guises, who had touched with\r\ntheir hand the sceptre of Henry\xc2\xa0III., the Cond\xc3\xa9s, who had placed their\r\nfoot on the steps of the throne of Henry\xc2\xa0IV., and Gaston, who had\r\ntried upon his brow the crown of Louis\xc2\xa0XIII.,--all returned, at the\r\nvoice of the minister, if not into nothingness, at least into\r\nimpotency. All who struggled against the iron will, enclosed in that\r\nfeeble body, were broken like glass. And all the struggle which\r\nRichelieu sustained, he did not sustain for his own sake, but for that\r\nof France. All the enemies, against whom he contended, were not his\r\nenemies merely, but those of the kingdom. If he clung tenaciously by\r\nthe side of a king, whom he compelled to live a melancholy, unhappy,\r\nand isolated life, whom he deprived successively of his friends, of\r\nhis mistresses, and of his family, as a tree is stripped of its\r\nleaves, of its branches, and of its bark, it was because friends,\r\nmistresses, and family exhausted the sap of the expiring royalty,\r\nwhich had need of all its egotism to prevent it from perishing. For it\r\nwas not intestinal struggles merely,--there was also foreign war,\r\nwhich had connected itself fatally with them. All those great nobles\r\nwhom he decimated, all those princes of the blood whom he exiled, were\r\ninviting foreigners to France; and these foreigners, answering eagerly\r\nto the summons, were entering the country on three different\r\nsides,--the English by Guienne, the Spaniards by Roussillon, and the\r\nAustrians by Artois.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of Richelieu\'s Policy.]\r\n\r\n"He repulsed the English by driving them to the Isle of R\xc3\xa9, and by\r\nbesieging La Rochelle; the Spaniards, by creating beside them the new\r\nkingdom of Portugal; and the imperialists, by detaching Bavaria from\r\nits alliance, by suspending their treaty with Denmark, and by sowing\r\ndissensions in the Catholic league. His measures were cruel, but not\r\nuncalled for. Chalais fell, but he had conspired with Lorraine and\r\nSpain; Montmorency fell, but he had entered France with arms in his\r\nhand; Cinq-Mars fell, but he had invited foreigners into the kingdom.\r\nBred a simple priest, he became not only a great statesman, but a\r\ngreat general. And when La Rochelle fell before those measures to\r\nwhich Schomberg and Bassompierre were compelled to bow, he said to the\r\nking, \'Sire, I am no prophet, but I assure your majesty that if you\r\nwill condescend to act as I advise you, you will pacificate Italy in\r\nthe month of May, subjugate Languedoc in the month of July, and be on\r\nyour return in the month of August.\' And each of these prophecies he\r\naccomplished in its time and place, and in such wise that, from that\r\nmoment, Louis\xc2\xa0XIII. vowed to follow forever the counsels of a man by\r\nwhich he had so well profited. Finally, he died, as Montesquieu\r\nasserts, after having made the monarch enact the secondary character\r\nin the monarchy, but the first in Europe; after having abased the\r\nking, but after having made his reign illustrious; and after having\r\nmowed down rebellion so close to the soil, that the descendants of\r\nthose who had composed the league could only form the Fronde, as,\r\nafter the reign of Napoleon, the successors of the La Vend\xc3\xa9e of \'93\r\ncould only execute the Vend\xc3\xa9e of \'32."\r\n\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XIII. did not long survive this greatest of ministers. Naturally\r\nweak, he was still weaker by disease. He was reduced to skin and bone.\r\nIn this state, he called a council, nominated his queen, Anne of\r\nAustria, regent, during the minority of his son Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., then four\r\nyears of age, and shortly after died, in 1643.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Richelieu\'s Policy.]\r\n\r\nMazarin, the new minister, followed out the policy of Richelieu. The\r\nwar with Austria and Spain was continued, which was closed, on the\r\nSpanish side, by the victory of Rocroi, in 1643, obtained by the\r\nPrince of Cond\xc3\xa9, and in which battle twenty-three thousand Frenchmen\r\ncompletely routed twenty-six thousand Spaniards, killing eight\r\nthousand, and taking six thousand prisoners--one of the bloodiest\r\nbattles ever fought. The great Cond\xc3\xa9 here obtained those laurels which\r\nsubsequent disgrace could never take away. The war on the side of\r\nGermany was closed, in 1648, by the peace of Westphalia. Turenne first\r\nappeared in the latter campaign of this long war, but gained no signal\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nCardinal Mazarin, a subtle and intriguing Italian, while he pursued\r\nthe policy of Richelieu, had not his genius or success. He was soon\r\ninvolved in domestic troubles. The aristocracy rebelled. Had they been\r\nunited, they would have succeeded; but their rivalries, jealousies,\r\nand squabbles divided their strength and distracted their councils.\r\nTheir cause was lost, and Mazarin triumphed, more from their divisions\r\nthan from his own strength.\r\n\r\nHe first had to oppose a clique of young nobles, full of arrogance and\r\nself-conceit, but scions of the greatest families. They hoped to\r\nrecover the ancient ascendency of their houses. The chief of these\r\nwere the Dukes of Beaufort, \xc3\x89pernon, and Guise. They made use, as\r\ntheir tool, of Madame Chevreuse, the confidential friend of the queen\r\nregent. And she demanded of the minister that posts of honor and power\r\nshould be given to her friends, which would secure that independence\r\nwhich Richelieu had spent his life in restraining. Mazarin tried to\r\namuse her, but, she being inexorable, he was obliged to break with\r\nher, and a conspiracy was the result, which, however, was easily\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cardinal de Retz.]\r\n\r\nBut a more formidable enemy appeared in the person of De Retz,\r\ncoadjutor archbishop of Paris, and afterwards cardinal, a man of\r\nboundless intrigue, unconquerable ambition, and restless discontent.\r\nTo detail his plots and intrigues, would be to describe a labyrinth.\r\nHe succeeded, however, in keeping the country in perpetual turmoil,\r\nnow inflaming the minds of the people, then exciting insurrections\r\namong the nobles, and then, again, encouraging the parliaments in\r\nresistance. He never appeared as an actor, but every movement was\r\ndirected by his genius. He did not escape suspicion, but committed no\r\novert acts by which he could be punished. He and the celebrated\r\nDuchess de Longueville, a woman who had as great a talent for intrigue\r\nas himself, were the life and soul of the Fronde--a civil war which\r\nended only in the re\xc3\xabstablishment of the monarchy on a firmer\r\nfoundation. As the Fronde had been commenced by a troop of urchins,\r\nwho, at the same time, amused themselves with slings, the wits of the\r\ncourt called the insurgents _frondeurs_, or slingers, insinuating that\r\ntheir force was trifling, and their aim mischief.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prince of Cond\xc3\xa9.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Frondeurs kept France in a state of anarchy for six\r\nyears, and they were headed by some of the most powerful nobles, and\r\neven supported by the Parliament of Paris. The people, too, were on\r\nthe side of the rebels, since they were ground down by taxation, and\r\nhoped to gain a relief from their troubles. But the rebels took the\r\nside of the oppressed only for their private advantage, and the\r\nparliament itself lacked the perseverance and intrepidity necessary to\r\nsecure its liberty. The civil war of the Fronde, though headed by\r\ndiscontented nobles, and animated by the intrigues of a turbulent\r\necclesiastic, was really the contest between the parliament and the\r\narbitrary power of the government. And the insurrection would have\r\nbeen fearful and successful, had the people been firm or the nobles\r\nfaithful to the cause they defended. But the English Revolution, then\r\nin progress, and in which a king had been executed, shocked the lovers\r\nof constitutional liberty in France, and reacted then, even as the\r\nFrench Revolution afterwards reacted on the English mind. Moreover,\r\nthe excesses which the people perpetrated at Paris, alarmed the\r\nparliament and the nobles who were allied with it, while it urged on\r\nthe ministers to desperate courses. The prince of Cond\xc3\xa9, whose\r\nvictories had given him an immortality, dallied with both parties, as\r\nhis interests served. Allied with the court, he could overpower the\r\ninsurgents; but allied with the insurgents, he could control the\r\ncourt. Sometimes he sided with the minister and sometimes with the\r\ninsurgents, but in neither case unless he exercised a power and\r\nenjoyed a remuneration dangerous in any government. Both parties were\r\njealous of him, both feared him, both hated him, both insulted him, and\r\nboth courted him. At one time, he headed the royal troops to attack\r\nParis, which was generally in the hands of the people and of\r\nparliament; and then, at another, he fought like a tiger to defend\r\nhimself in Paris against the royal troops. He had no sympathy with\r\neither the parliament or the people, while he fought for them; and he\r\nvenerated the throne, while he rebelled against it. His name was Louis\r\nde Bourbon, and he was a prince of the blood. He contended against the\r\ncrown only to wrest from it the ancient power of the great nobles; and\r\nto gain this object, he thought to make the parliament and the\r\nParisian mob his tools. The parliament, sincerely devoted to liberty,\r\nthought to make the nobles its tools, and only leagued with them to\r\nsecure their services. The crafty Mazarin quietly beheld these\r\ndissensions, and was sure of ultimate success, even though at one time\r\nbanished to Cologne. And, like a reed, he was ever ready to bend to\r\ndifficulties he could not control. But he stooped to conquer. He at\r\nlast got the Prince of Cond\xc3\xa9, his brother the Prince of Conti, and the\r\nDuke of Longueville, in his power. When the Duke of Orleans heard of\r\nit, he said, "He has taken a good haul in the net; he has taken a\r\nlion, a fox, and a monkey." But the princes escaped from the net, and,\r\nleagued with Turenne, Bouillon, La Rochefoucault, and other great\r\nnobles reached Paris, and were received with acclamations of joy by\r\nthe misguided people. Then, again, they obtained the ascendant. But\r\nthe ascendency was no sooner gained than the victors quarrelled with\r\nthemselves, and with the parliament, for whose cause they professed to\r\ncontend. It was in their power, when united, to have deprived the\r\nqueen regent of her authority, and to have established constitutional\r\nliberty in France. But they would not unite. There was no spirit of\r\ndisinterestedness, nor of patriotism, nor public virtue, without which\r\nliberty is impossible, even though there were forces enough to batter\r\ndown Mount Atlas. Cond\xc3\xa9, the victor, suffered himself to be again\r\nbribed by the court. He would not persevere in his alliance with\r\neither nobles or the parliament. He did not unite with the nobles\r\nbecause he felt that he was a prince. He did not continue with the\r\nparliament, because he had no sympathy with freedom. The cause of the\r\nnobles was lost for want of mutual confidence; that of the parliament\r\nfor lack of the spirit of perseverance. The parliament, at length,\r\ngrew weary of war and of popular commotions, and submitted to the\r\ncourt. All parties hated and distrusted each other, more than they did\r\nthe iron despotism of Mazarin. The power of insurgent nobles declined.\r\nDe Retz, the arch intriguer, was driven from Paris. The Duchess de\r\nLongueville sought refuge in the vale of Port Royal; and, in the\r\nJansenist doctrines, sought that happiness which earthly grandeur\r\ncould not secure. Cond\xc3\xa9 quitted Paris to join the Spanish armies. The\r\nrest of the rebellious nobles made humble submission. The people found\r\nthey had nothing to gain from any dominant party, and resigned\r\nthemselves to another long period of political and social slavery. The\r\nmagistrates abandoned, in despair and disgust, their high claims to\r\npolitical rights, while the young king, on his bed of justice, decreed\r\nthat parliament should no more presume to discuss or meddle with state\r\naffairs. The submissive parliament registered, without a murmur, the\r\nedict which gave a finishing stroke to its liberties. The Fronde war\r\nwas a complete failure, because all parties usurped powers which did\r\nnot belong to them, and were jealous of the rights of each other. The\r\nnobles wished to control the king, and the magistracy put itself\r\nforward to represent the commons, when the states general alone was\r\nthe ancient and true representative of the nation, and the body to\r\nwhich it should have appealed. The Fronde rebellion was a failure,\r\nbecause it did not consult constitutional forms, because it formed\r\nunnatural alliances, and because it did not throw itself upon the\r\nforce of immortal principles, but sought to support itself by mere\r\nphysical strength rather than by moral power, which alone is the\r\nsecret and the glory of all great internal changes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Power of Mazarin.]\r\n\r\nThe return of Cardinal Mazarin to power, as the minister of\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XIV., was the era of his grandeur. His first care was to restore\r\nthe public finances; his second was to secure his personal\r\naggrandizement. He obtained all the power which Richelieu had enjoyed,\r\nand reproved the king, and such a king as Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., as he would a\r\nschoolboy. He enriched and elevated his relatives, married them into\r\nthe first families of France; and amassed a fortune of two hundred\r\nmillions of livres, the largest perhaps that any subject has secured\r\nin modern times. He even aspired to the popedom; but this greatest of\r\nall human dignities, he was not permitted to obtain. A fatal malady\r\nseized him, and the physicians told him he had not two months to live.\r\nSome days after, he was seen in his dressing-gown, among his pictures,\r\nof which he was extravagantly fond, and exclaimed, "Must I quit all\r\nthese? Look at that Correggio, this Venus of Titian, this incomparable\r\ndeluge of Carracci. Farewell, dear pictures, that I have loved so\r\ndearly, and that have cost me so much."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Mazarin.]\r\n\r\nThe minister lingered awhile, and amused his last hours with cards. He\r\nexpired in 1661; and no minister after him was intrusted with such\r\ngreat power. He died unlamented, even by his sovereign, whose throne\r\nhe had preserved, and whose fortune he had repaired. He had great\r\ntalents of conversation, was witty, artful, and polite. He completed\r\nthe work which Richelieu began; and, at his death, his master was the\r\nmost absolute monarch that ever reigned in France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. et son Si\xc3\xa8cle.

AND CHARLES\xc2\xa0I.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Protestants in Germany were struggling for religious\r\nliberty, and the Parliaments of France for political privileges, there\r\nwas a contest going on in England for the attainment of the same great\r\nends. With the accession of James\xc2\xa0I. a new era commences in English\r\nhistory, marked by the growing importance of the House of Commons, and\r\ntheir struggles for civil and religious liberty. The Commons had not\r\nbeen entirely silent during the long reign of Elizabeth, but members\r\nof them occasionally dared to assert those rights of which Englishmen\r\nare proud. The queen was particularly sensitive to any thing which\r\npertained to her prerogative, and generally sent to the Tower any man\r\nwho boldly expressed his opinion on subjects which she deemed that she\r\nand her ministers alone had the right to discuss. These forbidden\r\nsubjects were those which pertained to the management of religion, to\r\nher particular courts, and to her succession to the crown. She never\r\nmade an attack on what she conceived to be the constitution, but only\r\nzealously defended what she considered as her own rights. And she was\r\never sufficiently wise to yield a point to the commons, after she had\r\nasserted her power, so that concession, on her part, had all the\r\nappearance of bestowing a favor. She never pushed matters to\r\nextremity, but gave way in good time. And in this policy she showed\r\ngreat wisdom; so that, in spite of all her crimes and caprices, she\r\never retained the affections of the English people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accession of James\xc2\xa0I.]\r\n\r\nThe son of her rival Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, ascended the throne,\r\n(1603,) under the title of _James\xc2\xa0I._, and was the first of the Stuart\r\nkings. He had been king of Scotland under the title of _James\xc2\xa0VI._,\r\nand had there many difficulties to contend with, chiefly in\r\nconsequence of the turbulence of the nobles, and the bigotry of the\r\nreformers. He was eager to take possession of his English inheritance,\r\nbut was so poor that he could not begin his journey until Cecil sent\r\nhim the money. He was crowned, with great ceremony, in Westminster\r\nAbbey, on the 25th of June.\r\n\r\nThe first acts of his reign were unpopular; and it was subsequently\r\ndisgraced by a continual succession of political blunders. To detail\r\nthese, or to mention all the acts of this king, or the events of his\r\ninglorious reign would fill a volume larger than this History.\r\nMoreover, from this period, modern history becomes very complicated\r\nand voluminous, and all that can be attempted in this work is, an\r\nallusion to the principal events.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Genius of the Reign of James.]\r\n\r\nThe genius of this reign is the contest between _royal prerogative and\r\npopular freedom_. The proceedings in parliament were characterized by\r\na spirit of boldness and resistance never before manifested, while the\r\nspeeches and acts of the king were marked by an obstinate and stupid\r\npertinacity to those privileges which absolute kings extorted from\r\ntheir subjects in former ages of despotism and darkness. The boldness\r\nof the Commons and the bigotry of the king led to incessant\r\ndisagreement and discontent; and, finally, under Charles\xc2\xa0I., to open\r\nrupture, revolution, and strife.\r\n\r\nThe progress of this insurrection and contest furnishes one of the\r\nmost important and instructive chapters in the history of society and\r\nthe young student cannot make himself too familiar with details, of\r\nwhich our limits forbid a description.\r\n\r\nThe great Puritan contest here begins, destined not to be closed until\r\nafter two revolutions, and nearly a century of anxiety, suffering, and\r\nstrife. Providence raised up, during the whole of the Stuart dynasty,\r\ngreat patriots and statesmen, who had an eye to perceive the true\r\ninterests and rights of the people, and a heart and a hand to defend\r\nthem. No period and no nation have ever been more fertile in great men\r\nthan England was from the accession of James\xc2\xa0I. to the abdication of\r\nJames\xc2\xa0II., a period of eighty-five years. Shakspeare, Raleigh, Coke,\r\nBacon, Cecil, Selden, Pym, Wentworth, Hollis, Leighton, Taylor,\r\nBaxter, Howe, Cromwell, Hampden, Blake, Vane, Milton, Clarendon,\r\nBurnet, Shaftesbury, are some of the luminaries which have shed a\r\nlight down to our own times, and will continue to shine through all\r\nfuture ages. They were not all contemporaneous, but they all took\r\npart, more or less, on one side or the other, in the great contest of\r\nthe seventeenth century. Whether statesmen, warriors, poets, or\r\ndivines, they alike made their age an epoch, and their little island\r\nthe moral centre of the world.\r\n\r\nBut we must first allude to some of the events of the reign of\r\nJames\xc2\xa0I., before the struggle between prerogative and liberty\r\nattracted the attention of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conspiracy of Sir Walter Raleigh.]\r\n\r\nOne of the first was the conspiracy against the king, in which Lord\r\nCobham and Sir Walter Raleigh were engaged. We lament that so great a\r\nfavorite with all readers as Sir Walter Raleigh, so universal a\r\ngenius, a man so learned, accomplished, and brave, should have even\r\nbeen suspected of a treasonable project, and without the excuse of\r\nsome traitors, that they wished to deliver their country from tyranny.\r\nBut there is no perfection in man. Sir Walter was restless and\r\nambitious, and had an eye mainly to his own advantage. His wit,\r\ngallantry, and chivalry were doubtless very pleasing qualities in a\r\ncourtier, but are not the best qualities of a patriot. He was\r\ndisappointed because he could not keep pace with Cecil in the favor of\r\nhis sovereign, and because the king took away the monopolies he had\r\nenjoyed. Hence, in conjunction with other disappointed politicians, he\r\nwas accused of an attempt to seize the king\'s person, to change the\r\nministry, and to place the Lady Arabella Stuart on the throne. Against\r\nRaleigh appeared no less a person than the great Coke, who prosecuted\r\nhim with such vehemence that Raleigh was found guilty, and condemned\r\nto death. But the proofs of his guilt are not so clear as the evidence\r\nof his ambition; and much must be attributed to party animosity.\r\nThough condemned, he was not executed; but lived to write many more\r\nbooks, and make many more voyages, to the great delight both of the\r\ncultivated and the adventurous. That there was a plot to seize the\r\nking is clear, and the conspirators were detected and executed.\r\nRaleigh was suspected of this, and perhaps was privy to it; but the\r\nproofs of his crime were not apparent, except to the judges, and to\r\nthe attorney-general, Coke, who compared the different plots to\r\nSamson\'s foxes, joined in the tails, though their heads were\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gunpowder Plot.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persecution of the Catholics.]\r\n\r\nThe most memorable event at this time in the domestic history of the\r\nkingdom was the Gunpowder Plot, planned by Catesby and other\r\ndisappointed and desperate Catholics for the murder of the king, and\r\nthe destruction of both houses of parliament. Knowing the sympathies\r\nof James for their religion, the Catholics had expected toleration, at\r\nleast. But when persecution continued against them, some reckless and\r\nunprincipled men united in a design to blow up the parliament. Percy,\r\na relation of the Earl of Northumberland, was concerned in the plot,\r\nand many of the other conspirators were men of good families and\r\nfortunes, but were implacable bigots. They hired a cellar, under the\r\nparliament house, which had been used for coals; and there they\r\ndeposited thirty-one barrels of gunpowder, waiting several months for\r\na favorable time to perpetrate one of the most horrid crimes ever\r\nprojected. It was resolved that Guy Fawkes, one of the number, should\r\nset fire to the train. They were all ready, and the 5th of November,\r\n1605, was at hand, the day to which parliament was prorogued; but\r\nPercy was anxious to save _his_ kinsman from the impending ruin, Sir\r\nEverard Digby wished to warn some of _his_ friends, and Tresham was\r\nresolved to give _his_ brother-in-law, Lord Mounteagle, a caution. It\r\nseems that this peer received a letter so peculiar, that he carried it\r\nto Cecil, who showed it to the king, and the king detected or\r\nsuspected a plot. The result was, that the cellar was explored by the\r\nlord chamberlain, and Guy Fawkes himself was found, with all the\r\nmaterials for striking a light, near the vault in which the coal and\r\nthe gunpowder were deposited. He was seized, interrogated, tortured,\r\nand imprisoned; but the wretch would not reveal the names of his\r\nassociates, although he gloried in the crime he was about to commit,\r\nand alleged, as his excuse, that violent diseases required desperate\r\nremedies, the maxim of the Jesuits. But most of the conspirators\r\nrevealed their guilt by flight. They might have escaped, had they fled\r\nfrom the kingdom; but they hastened only into the country to collect\r\ntheir friends, and head an insurrection, which, of course, was easily\r\nsuppressed. The leaders in this plot were captured and executed, and\r\nrichly deserved their fate, although it was clear that they were\r\ninfatuated. But in all crime there is infatuation. It was suspected\r\nthat the Jesuits were at the bottom of the conspiracy; and the whole\r\nCatholic population suffered reproach from the blindness and folly of\r\na few bigots, from whom no sect or party ever yet has been free. But\r\nthere is no evidence that any of the Catholic clergy were even privy\r\nto the intended crime, which was known only to the absolute plotters.\r\nSome Jesuits were indeed suspected, arrested, tortured, and executed;\r\nbut no evidence of guilt was brought against them sufficient to\r\nconvict them. But their acquittal was impossible in such a state of\r\nnational alarm and horror. Nothing ever made a more lasting and\r\nprofound impression on the English mind than this intended crime; and\r\nit strengthened the prejudices against the Catholics even more than\r\nthe persecutions under Queen Mary. Had the crime been consummated, it\r\nwould only have proved a blunder. It would have shocked and irritated\r\nthe nation beyond all self-control; and it is probable that the whole\r\nCatholic population would have been assassinated, or hunted out, as\r\nvictims for the scaffold, in every corner of England. It proved,\r\nhowever, a great misfortune, and the severest blow Catholicism ever\r\nreceived in England. Thus God overrules all human wickedness. There\r\nwas one person who suffered, in consequence of the excited suspicions\r\nof the nation, whose fate we cannot but compassionate; and this person\r\nwas the Earl of Northumberland, who was sentenced to pay a fine of\r\nthirty thousand pounds, to be deprived of all his offices, and to be\r\nimprisoned in the Tower for life, and simply because he was the head\r\nof the Catholic party, and a promoter of toleration. Indeed, penal\r\nstatutes against the Catholics were fearfully multiplied. No Catholic\r\nwas permitted to appear at court, or live in London, or within ten\r\nmiles of it, or remove, on any occasion, more than five miles from his\r\nhome, without especial license. No Catholic recusant was permitted to\r\npractise surgery, physic, or law; to act as judge, clerk, or officer\r\nof any court or corporation; or perform the office of administrator,\r\nexecutor, or guardian. Every Catholic who refused to have his child\r\nbaptized by a Protestant, was obliged to pay, for each omission, one\r\nhundred pounds. Every person keeping a Catholic servant, was compelled\r\nto pay ten pounds a month to government. Moreover, every recusant was\r\noutlawed; his house might be broken open; his books and furniture\r\ndestroyed; and his horses and arms taken from him. Such was the severe\r\ntreatment with which the Catholics, even those who were good citizens,\r\nwere treated by our fathers in England; and this persecution was\r\ndefended by some of the greatest jurists, divines, and statesmen which\r\nEngland has produced. And yet some maintain that there has been no\r\nprogress in society, except in material civilization!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset.]\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiarities of the reign of James was, the ascendency\r\nwhich favorites obtained over him, so often the mark of a weak and\r\nvacillating mind. Henry\xc2\xa0VIII. and Elizabeth had their favorites; but\r\nthey were ministers of the royal will. Moreover, they, like Wolsey,\r\nCromwell, Burleigh, and Essex, were great men, and worthy of the trust\r\nreposed in them. But James, with all his kingcraft and statecraft,\r\nwith all his ostentation and boasts of knowledge and of sagacity,\r\nreposed his confidence in such a man as Villiers, Duke of Buckingham.\r\nIt is true he also had great men to serve him; Cecil was his\r\nsecretary, Bacon was his chancellor, and Coke was his chief justice.\r\nBut Carr and Villiers rose above them all in dignity and honor, and\r\nwere the companions and confidential agents of their royal master.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greatness and Fall of Somerset.]\r\n\r\nRobert Carr was a Scottish gentleman, poor and cunning, who had early\r\nbeen taught that personal beauty, gay dress, and lively manners, would\r\nmake his fortune at court. He first attracted the attention of the\r\nking at a tilting match, at which he was the esquire to Lord Dingwall.\r\nIn presenting his lord\'s shield to the king, his horse fell and threw\r\nhim at James\'s feet. His leg was broken, but his fortune was made.\r\nJames, struck with his beauty and youth, and moved by the accident,\r\nsent his own surgeon to him, visited him himself, and even taught him\r\nLatin, seeing that the scholastic part of his education had been\r\nneglected. Indeed, James would have made a much better schoolmaster\r\nthan king; and his pedantry and conceit were beyond all bounds, so\r\nthat Bacon styled him, either in irony or sycophancy, "the Solomon of\r\nthe age." Carr now became the pet of the learned monarch. He was\r\nknighted, rich presents were bestowed on him, all bowed down to him as\r\nthey would have done to a royal mistress; and Cecil and Suffolk vied\r\nwith each other in their attempts to secure the favor of his friends.\r\nHe gradually eclipsed every great noble at court, was created Viscount\r\nRochester, received the Order of the Garter, and, when Cecil, then\r\nEarl of Salisbury, died, received the post of the Earl of Suffolk as\r\nlord chamberlain, he taking Cecil\'s place as treasurer. Rochester, in\r\neffect, became prime minister, as Cecil had been. He was then created\r\nEarl of Somerset, in order that he might marry the Countess of Essex,\r\nthe most beautiful and fascinating woman at the English court. She was\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Suffolk, and granddaughter of the old Duke of\r\nNorfolk, executed in 1572, and, consequently, belonged to the first\r\nfamily in the realm. She was married to Essex at the age of thirteen,\r\nbut treated him with contempt and coldness, being already enamored of\r\nthe handsome favorite. That she might marry Carr she obtained a\r\ndivorce from her husband on the most frivolous grounds, and through\r\nthe favor of the king, who would do any thing for the man he delighted\r\nto honor. She succeeded in obtaining her end, and caused the ruin of\r\nall who opposed her wishes. But she proved a beautiful demon, a\r\nfascinating fury, as might be expected from such an unprincipled\r\nwoman, although ennobled by "the blood of all the Howards." Her reign\r\nlasted, however, only during the ascendency of her husband. For a\r\ntime, "glorious days were succeeded by as glorious nights, when masks\r\nand dancings had a continual motion, and when banquetings rapt up the\r\nspirit of the sacred king, and kept it from descending to earthly\r\nthings." But whatever royal favor stamps, royal favor, like fashion,\r\nleaves. Carr was supplanted by Villiers, and his doom was sealed. For\r\nthe murder of his old friend Sir Thomas Overbury, who died in the\r\nTower, as it was then supposed by poison, he and his countess were\r\ntried, found guilty, and disgraced. But he was not executed, and,\r\nafter a few years\' imprisonment, retired to the country, with his\r\nlady, to reproach and hate each other. Their only child, the Lady Anna\r\nCarr, a woman of great honor and virtue, married the first duke of\r\nBedford, and was the mother of Lord Russell who died on the scaffold,\r\na martyr to liberty, in the reign of Charles\xc2\xa0II. The origin of the\r\nnoble families of England is curious. Some few are descended from\r\nsuccessful Norman chieftains, who came over with William the\r\nConqueror, and whose merit was in their sword. Others are the\r\ndescendants of those who, as courtiers, statesmen, or warriors,\r\nobtained great position, power, and wealth, during former reigns. Many\r\nowe their greatness to the fact that they are the offspring of the\r\nillegitimate children of kings, or the descendants of the ignoble\r\nminions of kings. Some few are enrolled in the peerage on account of\r\ntheir great wealth; and a still smaller number for the eminent\r\nservices they have rendered their country like Wellington, Brougham,\r\nor Ellenborough. A vast majority can boast only the merit or the\r\nsuccessful baseness of their ancestors. But all of them are\r\ninterlinked by marriages, and therefore share together the glory or\r\nthe shame of their progenitors, so far as glory and shame can be\r\ntransmitted from father to son, independently of all individual virtue\r\nor vice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duke of Buckingham.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Bacon.]\r\n\r\nCarr was succeeded in the royal favor by Villiers, and he, more\r\nfortunate, ever retained the ascendency over the mind and heart of\r\nJames, as well as of his son Charles\xc2\xa0I. George Villiers owed his\r\nfortune, not to his birth or talents, but to his fine clothes, his\r\nParisian manners, smooth face, tall figure, and bland smiles. He\r\nbecame cup-bearer, then knight, then gentleman of the privy council,\r\nthen earl, then marquis, and finally duke of Buckingham, lord high\r\nadmiral, warden of the Cinque Ports, high steward of Westminster,\r\nconstable of Windsor Castle, and chief justice in eyre of the parks\r\nand forests. "The doting and gloating king" had taught Somerset Latin;\r\nhe attempted to teach Buckingham divinity, and called him ever by the\r\nname of "Steenie." And never was there such a mixture of finery,\r\neffeminacy, insolence, and sycophancy in any royal minion before or\r\nsince. Beau Brummell never equalled him in dress, Wolsey in\r\nmagnificence, Mazarin in peculation, Walpole in corruption, Jeffries\r\nin insolence, or Norfolk in pride. He was the constant companion of\r\nthe king, to whose vices he pandered, and through him the royal favor\r\nflowed. But no rewards, or favors, or greatness satisfied him; not so\r\nmuch because he was ambitious, as because, like a spoiled child, he\r\ndid not appreciate the magnitude of the gifts which were bestowed on\r\nhim. Nor did he ever know his place; but made love to the queen of\r\nFrance herself, when he was sent on an embassy. He trampled on the\r\nconstitution, subverted the laws, ground down the people by taxes, and\r\ntaught the king to disregard the affections of his subjects, and to\r\nview them as his slaves. But such a triumph of iniquity could not be\r\nendured; and Buckingham was finally assassinated, after he had gained\r\nan elevation higher than any English subject ever before attained,\r\nexcept Wolsey, and without the exercise of any qualities which\r\nentitled him to a higher position than a master of ceremonies at a\r\nfashionable ball. It is easy to conceive that such a minion should\r\narrive at power under such a monarch as James; but how can we\r\nunderstand that such a man as Lord Bacon, the chancellor, the\r\nphilosopher, the statesman, the man of learning, genius, and wisdom,\r\nshould have bowed down to the dust, in vile subserviency, to this\r\ninfamous favorite of the king. Surely, what lessons of the frailty of\r\nhuman nature does the reign of James teach us! The most melancholy\r\ninstance of all the singular cases of human inconsistency, at this\r\ntime, is the conduct of the great Bacon himself, who reached the\r\nzenith of his power during this reign. It is not the receiving of a\r\nbribe, while exercising the highest judicial authority in the land, on\r\nwhich alone his shame rests, but his insolent conduct to his\r\ninferiors, his acquiescence in wrong, his base and unmanly sycophancy,\r\nhis ingratitude to his friends and patrons, his intense selfishness\r\nand unscrupulous ambition while climbing to power, and, above all, his\r\nwillingness to be the tool of a despot who trampled on the rights and\r\nliberties which God had given him to guard; and this in an age of\r\nlight, of awakened intelligence, when even his crabbed rival Coke was\r\nseeking to explode the abuses of the Dark Ages. But "the difference\r\nbetween the soaring angel and the creeping snake, was but a type of\r\nthe difference between Bacon the philosopher and Bacon the\r\nattorney-general, Bacon seeking for truth and Bacon seeking for the\r\nSeals." As the author of the Novum Organum, as the pioneer of modern\r\nscience, as the calm and patient investigator of nature\'s laws, as the\r\nminer and sapper of the old false systems of philosophy which enslaved\r\nthe human mind, as the writer for future generations, he has received,\r\nas he has deserved, all the glory which admiring and grateful millions\r\ncan bestow, of his own nation, and of all nations. No name in British\r\nannals is more illustrious than his, and none which is shaded with\r\nmore lasting shame. Pope alone would have given him an immortality as\r\nthe "wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind." The only defence for the\r\npolitical baseness of Bacon--and this is insufficient--is, that all\r\nwere base around him. The years when he was in power are among the\r\ndarkest and most disgraceful in English history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trial and Execution of Raleigh.]\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to the reign of favorites; but this was but a\r\nsmall part of the evils of the times. Every thing abroad and at home\r\nwas mismanaged. Patents of monopolies were multiplied; the most\r\ngrievous exactions were made; indefensible executions were ordered;\r\nthe laws were perverted; justice was sold; and an ignominious war was\r\nclosed by a still more ignominious peace. The execution of Raleigh was\r\na disgrace to the king, the court, and the nation, because the manner\r\nof it was so cowardly and cruel. He had been convicted, in the early\r\npart of the reign, of treason, and committed to the Tower. There he\r\nlanguished twelve years, amusing himself by writing a universal\r\nhistory, and in seeking the elixir of life; for, in the mysteries of\r\nchemistry, and in the mazes of historical lore, as in the intrigues of\r\ncourts, and dangers of camps, he was equally at home.\r\n\r\nHe was released from his prison in order to take command of an\r\nadventurous expedition to Guiana in quest of gold. In a former voyage\r\nhe had visited the banks of the Oronoco in quest of the city of Manoa,\r\nwhere precious stones and gold existed in exhaustless treasures. That\r\nEl Dorado he could not find; but now, in prison, he proposed to\r\nSecretary Winwood an expedition to secure what he had before sought in\r\nvain. The king wavered a while between his cupidity and fear; for,\r\nwhile he longed for gold, as the traveller does for water on the\r\ndesert of Sahara, he was afraid of giving offence to the Spanish\r\nambassador. But his cupidity was the stronger feeling, and Raleigh was\r\nsent with fourteen ships to the coasts of South America. The\r\nexpedition was in every respect unfortunate to Raleigh and to the\r\nking. The gallant commander lost his private fortune and a promising\r\nson, the Spaniards attacked his armament, his troops mutinied and\r\ndeserted, and he returned to England, with a sullied fame, to meet a\r\ndisappointed sovereign and implacable enemies. In such times, failure\r\nis tantamount to crime, and Raleigh was tried for offences he never\r\ncommitted. The most glaring injustice, harshness, and sophistry were\r\nresorted to, even by Bacon; but still Raleigh triumphantly defended\r\nhimself. But no innocence or eloquence could save him; and he was\r\nexecuted on the sentence which had been pronounced against him for\r\ntreason fifteen years before. To such meanness and cowardice did his\r\nenemies resort to rid the world of a universal genius, whose crime--if\r\ncrime he ever committed--had long been consigned to oblivion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Encroachments of James.]\r\n\r\nBut we cannot longer dwell on the lives of eminent individuals during\r\nthe reign of James. However interesting may be the details of their\r\nfortunes, their history dwindles into insignificance when compared\r\nwith the great public injuries which an infatuated monarch inflicted.\r\nNot cruel in his temper, not stained by personal crimes, quite learned\r\nin Greek and Latin, but weak and ignorant of his duties as a king, he\r\nwas inclined to trespass on the rights of his subjects. As has been\r\nalready remarked, the genius of his reign was the contest between\r\nprerogative and liberty. The Commons did not acquiesce in his\r\nmeasures, or yield to his wishes, as they did during the reign of\r\nElizabeth. He had a notion that the duty of a king was to command, and\r\nthat of the subject was to obey, in all things; that kings ruled by\r\ndivine right, and were raised by the Almighty above all law. But such\r\nnotions were not approved by a parliament which swarmed with Puritans,\r\nand who were not careful to conceal their views from the king. They\r\ninsisted on their privileges as tenaciously as the king insisted on\r\nhis prerogative, and often came into collision with him. And they\r\ninstituted an inquiry into monopolies, and attacked the monstrous\r\nabuses of purveyance, and the incidents of feudal tenure, by which,\r\namong other things, the king became guardian to wards, and received\r\nthe profits of their estates during their minority. These feudal\r\nclaims, by which the king, in part, received his revenue, were every\r\nyear becoming less valuable to the crown, and more offensive to the\r\npeople. The king, at length, was willing to compound, and make a\r\nbargain with the Commons, by which he was to receive two hundred\r\nthousand pounds a year, instead of the privileges of wardship, and\r\nother feudal rights. But his necessities required additional grants,\r\nwhich the Commons were unwilling to bestow; and the king then resorted\r\nto the sale of monopolies and even peerages, sent the more turbulent\r\nof the Commons to prison, and frequently dissolved parliament. He was\r\nresolved to tax the people if supplies were not granted him, while the\r\nCommons maintained that no taxation could be allowed without their\r\nconsent. Moreover, the Commons refused to grant such supplies as the\r\nking fancied he needed, unless certain grievances were redressed,\r\namong which was the High Commission Court, an arbitrary tribunal,\r\nwhich fined and imprisoned without appeal. But James, though pressed\r\nfor money, stood firm to his notions of prerogative, and supplied his\r\nmost urgent necessities by illegal means. People were dragged to the\r\nStar Chamber, on all kinds of accusations, that they might be\r\nsentenced to pay enormous fines; new privileges and monopolies were\r\ninvented, and new dignities created. Baronets, who are hereditary\r\nknights, were instituted, and baronetcies were sold for one thousand\r\npounds each.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quarrel between James and Parliament.]\r\n\r\nBut the monopolies which the king granted, in order to raise money,\r\ndid not inflame the Commons so much as the projected marriage between\r\nthe prince of Wales and the infanta of Spain. James flattered himself\r\nthat this Spanish match, to arrange which he had sent Buckingham to\r\nthe court of Madrid, would procure the restitution of the Palatinate\r\nto the elector, who had been driven from his throne. But the Commons\r\nthought differently. They, as well as the people generally, were\r\nindignant in view of the inactivity of the government in not sending\r\naid to the distressed Protestants of Germany; and the loss of the\r\nPalatinate was regarded as a national calamity. They saw no good which\r\nwould accrue from an alliance with the enemies and persecutors of\r\nthese Protestants; but, on the other hand, much evil. As the\r\nconstitutional guardians, therefore, of the public welfare and\r\nliberty, they framed a remonstrance to the king, representing the\r\novergrown power of Austria as dangerous to the liberties of Europe,\r\nand entreated his majesty to take up arms against Spain, which was\r\nallied with Austria, and by whose wealth Austrian armies were\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\nJames was inflamed with indignation at this remonstrance, which\r\nmilitated against all his maxims of government; and he forthwith wrote\r\na letter to the speaker of the House of Commons, commanding him to\r\nadmonish the members "not to presume to meddle with matters of state\r\nwhich were beyond their capacity, and especially not to touch on his\r\nson\'s marriage." The Commons, not dismayed, and conscious of strength,\r\nsent up a new remonstrance in which they affirmed that they _were_\r\nentitled to interpose with their counsel in all matters of state, and\r\nthat entire freedom of speech was their ancient and undoubted right,\r\ntransmitted from their ancestors. The king, in reply, told the\r\nCommons, that "their remonstrance was more like a denunciation of war,\r\nthan an address of dutiful subjects, and that their pretension to\r\ninquire into state affairs was a plenipotence to which none of their\r\nancestors, even during the weakest reigns, had ever dared to aspire."\r\nHe farther insinuated that their privileges were derived from royal\r\nfavor. On this, the Commons framed another protest,--that the\r\nliberties, franchises, privileges, and jurisdictions of parliament are\r\nthe ancient and undoubted birthright of Englishmen, and that every\r\nmember has the right of freedom of speech. This protest they entered\r\nupon their journals, upon which James lost all temper, ordered the\r\nclerk to bring him the journals, erased the protestation with his own\r\nhand, in presence of the judges and the council, and then dissolved\r\nthe parliament.\r\n\r\nNothing else of note occurred in this reign, except the prosecution of\r\nthe Spanish match, which was so odious to the nation that Buckingham,\r\nto preserve his popularity, broke off the negotiations, and by a\r\nsystem of treachery and duplicity as hateful as were his original\r\nefforts to promote the match. War with Spain was the result of the\r\ninsult offered to the infanta and the court. An alliance was now made\r\nwith France, and Prince Charles married Henrietta Maria, daughter of\r\nHenry\xc2\xa0IV. The Commons then granted abundant supplies for war, to\r\nrecover the Palatinate; and liberty of conscience was granted by the\r\nmonarch, on the demands of Richelieu, to the Catholics--so long and,\r\nperseveringly oppressed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of James\xc2\xa0I.]\r\n\r\nShortly after, (March 27, 1625,) King James died at Theobalds, his\r\nfavorite palace, from a disease produced by anxiety, gluttony, and\r\nsweet wines, after a reign in England of twenty-two years; and his\r\nson, Charles\xc2\xa0I., before the breath was out of his body, was proclaimed\r\nking in his stead.\r\n\r\nThe course pursued by James\xc2\xa0I. was adopted by his son; and, as their\r\nreigns were memorable for the same struggle, we shall consider them\r\ntogether until revolution gave the victory to the advocates of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0I. was twenty-five years of age when he began his reign. In a\r\nmoral and social point of view he was a more respectable man than his\r\nfather, but had the same absurd notions of the royal prerogative, the\r\nsame contempt of the people, the same dislike of constitutional\r\nliberty, and the same resolution of maintaining the absolute power of\r\nthe crown, at any cost. He was moreover, perplexed by the same\r\nembarrassments, was involved in debt, had great necessities, and was\r\ndependent on the House of Commons for aid to prosecute his wars and\r\nsupport the dignity of the crown. But he did not consider the changing\r\ncircumstances and spirit of the age, and the hostile and turbulent\r\nnature of his people. He increased, rather than diminished, the odious\r\nmonopolies which irritated the nation during the reign of his father;\r\nhe clung to all the old feudal privileges; he retained the detestable\r\nand frivolous Buckingham as his chief minister; and, when Buckingham\r\nwas assassinated, he chose others even more tyrannical and\r\nunscrupulous; he insisted on taxing the people without their consent,\r\nthrew contempt on parliament, and drove the nation to rebellion. In\r\nall his political acts he was infatuated, after making every allowance\r\nfor the imperfections of human nature. A wiser man would have seen the\r\nrising storm, and might possibly have averted it. But Charles never\r\ndreamed of it, until it burst in all its fury on his devoted head, and\r\nconsigned him to the martyr\'s grave. We pity his fate, but lament\r\nstill more his blindness. And so great was this blindness, that it\r\nalmost seems as if Providence had marked him out to be a victim on the\r\naltar of human progress.\r\n\r\nWith the reign of Charles commences unquestionably the most exciting\r\nperiod of English history, and a period to which historians have given\r\nmore attention than to any other great historical era, the French\r\nRevolution alone excepted. The attempt to describe the leading events\r\nin this exciting age and reign would be, in this connection, absurd;\r\nand yet some notice of them cannot be avoided.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Struggle of Classes.]\r\n\r\nFor more than ten centuries, great struggles have been going on in\r\nsociety between the dominant orders and sects. The victories gained by\r\nthe oppressed millions, over their different masters, constitute what\r\nis called the Progress of Society. Defenders of the people have\r\noccasionally arisen from orders to which they did not belong. When,\r\nthen, any great order defended the cause of the people against the\r\ntyranny and selfishness of another order, then the people have\r\nadvanced a step in civil and social freedom.\r\n\r\nWhen Feudalism weighed fearfully upon the people, "the clergy sought,\r\non their behalf, a little reason, justice, and humanity, and the poor\r\nman had no other asylum than the churches, no other protectors than\r\nthe priests; and, as the priests offered food to the moral nature of\r\nman, they acquired a great ascendency, and the preponderance passed\r\nfrom the nobles to the clergy." By the aid of the church, royalty also\r\nrose above feudalism, and aided the popular cause.\r\n\r\nThe church, having gained the ascendency, sought then to enslave the\r\nkings of the earth. But royalty, borrowing help from humiliated nobles\r\nand from the people, became the dominant power in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of Popular Power.]\r\n\r\nIn these struggles between nobles and the clergy, and between the\r\nclergy and kings, the people had acquired political importance. They\r\nhad obtained a knowledge of their rights and of their strength; and\r\nthey were determined to maintain them. They liked not the tyranny of\r\neither nobles, priests, or kings; but they bent all their energies to\r\nsuppress the power of the latter, since the two former had been\r\nalready humiliated.\r\n\r\nThe struggle of the people against royalty is pre\xc3\xabminently the genius\r\nof the English Revolution. It is to be doubted whether any king could\r\nhave resisted the storm of popular fury which hurled Charles from his\r\nthrone. But no king could have managed worse than he, no king could be\r\nmore unfortunately and unpropitiously placed; and his own imprudence\r\nand folly hastened the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons, which had acquired great strength, spirit, and\r\npopularity during the reign of James, fully perceived the difficulties\r\nand necessities of Charles, but made no adequate or generous effort to\r\nrelieve him from them. Some of the more turbulent rejoiced in them.\r\nThey knew that kings, like other men, were selfish, and that it was\r\nnot natural for people to part with their privileges and power without\r\na struggle, even though this power was injurious to the interests of\r\nsociety. In the Middle Ages, barons, bishops, and popes had fought\r\ndesperately in the struggle of classes; and it was only from their\r\nnecessities that either kings or people had obtained what they\r\ndemanded. King Charles, no more than Pope Boniface\xc2\xa0VIII., would\r\nsurrender, as a boon to man, without compulsion, his supposed\r\nomnipotence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quarrel between the King and the Commons.]\r\n\r\nThe king ascended his throne burdened by the debts of his father, and\r\nby an expensive war, which the Commons incited, but would not pay for.\r\nThey granted him, to meet his difficulties and maintain his honor, the\r\npaltry sum of one hundred and forty thousand pounds, and the duties of\r\ntonnage and poundage, not for life, as was customary, but for a year.\r\nNothing could be more provoking to a young king. Of course, the money\r\nwas soon spent, and the king wanted more, and had a right to expect\r\nmore. But, if the Commons granted what the king required, he would be\r\nmade independent of them, and he would rule tyrannically, as the kings\r\nof England did before him. So they resolved not to grant necessary\r\nsupplies to carry on the government, unless the king would part with\r\nthe prerogatives of an absolute prince, and those old feudal\r\nprivileges which were an abomination in the eyes of the people.\r\nCharles was not the man to make such a bargain. Few kings, in his age,\r\nwould have seen its necessity. But necessity there was. Civil war was\r\ninevitable, without a compromise, provided both parties were resolved\r\non maintaining their ground. But Charles fancied that the Commons\r\ncould be browbeaten and intimidated into submission; and, moreover, in\r\ncase he was brought into collision with his subjects, he fancied that\r\nhe was stronger than they, and could put down the spirit of\r\nresistance. In both of these suppositions he was wrong. The Commons\r\nwere firm, and were stronger than he was, because they had the\r\nsympathy of the people. They believed conscientiously, especially the\r\nPuritans, that he was wrong; that God gave him no divine right to\r\nenslave them, and that they were entitled, by the eternal principles\r\nof justice, and by the spirit of the constitution, to civil and\r\nreligious liberty, in the highest sense of that term. They believed\r\nthat their rights were inalienable and absolute; that, among them,\r\nthey could not be taxed without their own consent; and that their\r\nconstitutional guardians, the Commons, should be unrestricted in\r\ndebate. These notions of the people were _ideas_. On ideas all\r\ngovernments rest. No throne could stand a day unless the people felt\r\nthey owed it their allegiance. When the main support of the throne of\r\nCharles was withdrawn, the support of popular ideas, and this support\r\ngiven to the House of Commons, at issue with the sovereign, what could\r\nhe do? What could Louis\xc2\xa0XVI. do one hundred and fifty years\r\nafterwards? What could Louis Philippe do in our times? A king, without\r\nthe loyalty of the people, is a phantom, a mockery, and a delusion,\r\nunless he have physical force to sustain him; and even then armies\r\nwill rebel, if they feel they are not bound to obey, and if it is not\r\nfor their interest to obey.\r\n\r\nNow Charles had neither _loyalty_ nor _force_ to hold him on his\r\nthrone. The agitations of an age of unprecedented boldness in\r\nspeculations destroyed the former; the House of Commons would not\r\ngrant supplies to secure the latter. And they would not grant\r\nsupplies, because they loved themselves and the cause of the people\r\nbetter than they loved their king. In short, it was only by his\r\nconcessions that they would supply his necessities. He would not make\r\nthe concessions, and the contest soon ended in an appeal to arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Counsellors of Charles.]\r\n\r\nBut Charles was not without friends, and some of his advisers were men\r\nof sagacity and talent. It is true they did not fully appreciate the\r\nweakness of the king, or the strength of his enemies; but they saw his\r\ndistress, and tried to remove it. They, very naturally in such an age,\r\nrecommended violent courses--to grant new monopolies, to extort fines,\r\nto exercise all his feudal privileges, to pawn the crown jewels, even,\r\nin order to raise money; for money, at all events, he must have. They\r\nadvised him to arrest turbulent and incendiary members of the Commons,\r\nto prorogue and dissolve parliaments, to raise forced loans, to impose\r\nnew duties, to shut up ports, to levy fresh taxes, and to raise armies\r\nfriendly to his cause. In short, they recommended unconstitutional\r\nmeasures--measures which both they and the king knew to be\r\nunconstitutional, but which they justified on the ground of necessity.\r\nAnd the king, in his perplexity, did what his ministers advised. But\r\nevery person who was sent to the Tower, every new tax, every sentence\r\nof the Star Chamber, every seizure of property, every arbitrary\r\ncommand, every violation of the liberties of the people, raised up new\r\nenemies to the king, and inflamed the people with new discontents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Buckingham--Petition of Right.]\r\n\r\nAt first the Commons felt that they could obtain what they wanted--a\r\nredress of grievances, if the king\'s favorite adviser and minister\r\nwere removed. Besides, they all hated Buckingham--peers, commons, and\r\npeople,--and all sought his downfall. He had no friends among the\r\npeople, as Essex had in the time of Elizabeth. His extravagance, pomp,\r\nand insolence disgusted all orders; and his reign seemed to be an\r\ninsult to the nation. Even the people regarded him as an upstart,\r\nsetting himself above the old nobility, and enriching himself by royal\r\ndomains, worth two hundred eighty-four thousand three hundred and\r\nninety-five pounds. So the Commons violently attacked his\r\nadministration, and impeached him. But he was shielded by the king,\r\nand even appointed to command an expedition to relieve La Rochelle,\r\nthen besieged by Richelieu. But he was stabbed by a religious fanatic,\r\nby the name of Felton, as he was about to embark at Portsmouth. His\r\nbody was removed to London, and he was buried with great state in\r\nWestminster Abbey, much lamented by the king, who lost his early\r\nfriend, one of the worst ministers, but not the worst man, which that\r\nage despised, (1628.)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the indignant Commons persevered with their work. They\r\npassed what is called the "Petition of Right,"--a string of\r\nresolutions which asserted that no freeman ought to be detained in\r\nprison, without being brought to trial, and that no taxes could be\r\nlawfully levied, without consent of the Commons--the two great pillars\r\nof the English constitution, yet truths involved in political\r\ndifficulty, especially in cases of rebellion. The personal liberty of\r\nthe subject is a great point indeed; and the act of _habeas corpus_,\r\npassed in later times, is a great step in popular freedom; but, if\r\nnever to be suspended, no government could guard against conspiracy in\r\nrevolutionary times.\r\n\r\nThe Petition of Right, however, obtained the king\'s assent, though\r\nunwillingly, grudgingly, and insincerely given; and the Commons,\r\ngratified for once, voted to the king supplies.\r\n\r\nBut Charles had no notion of keeping his word, and soon resorted to\r\nunconstitutional measures, as before. But he felt the need of able\r\ncounsellors. His "dear Steenie" was dead, and he knew not in whom to\r\nrepose confidence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Earl of Strafford.]\r\n\r\nThe demon of despotism raised up an agent in the person of Thomas\r\nWentworth, a man of wealth, talents, energy, and indomitable courage;\r\na man who had, in the early part of his career, defended the cause of\r\nliberty; who had even suffered imprisonment sooner than contribute to\r\nan unlawful loan, and in whom the hopes of the liberal party were\r\nplaced. But he was bribed. His patriotism was not equal to his\r\nambition. Seduced by a peerage, and by the love of power, he went over\r\nto the side of the king, and defended his arbitrary rule as zealously\r\nas he had before advocated the cause of constitutional liberty. He was\r\ncreated Viscount Wentworth, and afterwards earl of Strafford--the most\r\nprominent man of the royalist party, and the greatest traitor to the\r\ncause of liberty which England had ever known. His picture, as painted\r\nby Vandyke, and hung up in the princely hall of his descendant, Earl\r\nFitzwilliam, is a faithful portrait of what history represents him--a\r\ncold, dark, repulsive, unscrupulous tyrant, with an eye capable of\r\nreading the secrets of the soul, a brow lowering with care and\r\nthought, and a lip compressed with determination, and twisted into\r\ncontempt of mankind. If Wentworth did not love his countrymen, he\r\nloved to rule over them: and he gained his end, and continued the\r\nprime minister of absolutism until an insulted nation rose in their\r\nmight, and placed his head upon the block.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Hampden.]\r\n\r\nUnder the rule of this minister, whom every one feared, the Puritans\r\nevery where fled, preferring the deserts of America, with freedom, to\r\nthe fair lands of England, with liberty trodden under foot. The reigns\r\nof both James and Charles are memorable for the resistance and despair\r\nof this intrepid and religious sect, in which were enrolled some of\r\nthe finest minds and most intelligent patriots of the country. Pym,\r\nCromwell, Hazelrig, and even Hampden, are said to have actually\r\nembarked; but Providence detained them in England, they having a\r\nmission of blood to perform there. In another chapter, the Puritans,\r\ntheir struggles, and principles, will be more fully presented; and we\r\ntherefore, in this connection, abstain from further notice. It may,\r\nhowever, be remarked, that they were the most inflexible enemies of\r\nthe king, and were determined to give him and his minister no rest\r\nuntil all their ends were gained. They hated Archbishop Laud even more\r\nintensely than they hated Wentworth; and Laud, if possible, was a\r\ngreater foe to religious and civil liberty. Strafford and Laud are\r\ngenerally coupled together in the description of the abuses of\r\narbitrary power. The churchman, however, was honest and sincere, only\r\nhis views were narrow and his temper irritable. His vices were those\r\nof the bigot--such as disgraced St. Dominic or Torquemada, but faults\r\nwhich he deemed excellencies. He was an enthusiast in high churchism\r\nand toryism; and his zeal in defence of royal prerogative and the\r\ndivine rights of bishops has won for him the panegyrics of his\r\nfriends, as well as the curses of his enemies. For Strafford, too,\r\nthere is admiration, but only for his talents, his courage, his\r\nstrength--the qualities which one might see in Milton\'s Satan, or in\r\nCarlyle\'s picture gallery of heroes.\r\n\r\nWhile the king and his minister were raising forced loans and\r\ncontributions, sending members of the House of Commons to the Tower,\r\nfining, imprisoning, and mutilating the Puritans, a new imposition\r\ncalled out the energies of a great patriot and a great man, John\r\nHampden--a fit antagonist of the haughty Wentworth. This new exaction\r\nwas a tax called _ship money_.\r\n\r\nIt was devised by Chief Justice Finch and Attorney-General Noy, two\r\nsubordinate, but unscrupulous tools of despotism, and designed to\r\nextort money from the inland counties, as well as from the cities, for\r\nfurnishing ships--a demand that Elizabeth did not make, in all her\r\npower, even when threatened by the Spanish Armada. Clarendon even\r\nadmits that this tax was not for the support of the navy, "but for a\r\nspring and magazine which should have no bottom, and for an\r\neverlasting supply on all occasions." And this the nation completely\r\nunderstood, and resolved desperately to resist.\r\n\r\nHampden, though a wealthy man, refused to pay the share assessed on\r\nhim, which was only twenty shillings, deeming it an illegal tax. He\r\nwas proceeded against by the crown lawyers. Hampden appealed to a\r\ndecision of the judges in regard to the legality of the tax, and the\r\nking permitted the question to be settled by the laws. The trial\r\nlasted thirteen days, but ended in the condemnation of Hampden, who\r\nhad shown great moderation, as well as courage, and had won the favor\r\nof the people. It was shortly after this that Hampden, as some\r\nhistorians assert, resolved to leave England with his cousin Oliver\r\nCromwell. But the king prevented the ships, in which they and other\r\nemigrants had embarked, from sailing. Hampden was reserved for new\r\ntrials and new labors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insurrection in Scotland.]\r\n\r\nAbout a month after Hampden\'s condemnation, an insurrection broke out\r\nin Scotland, which hastened the crisis of revolution. It was produced\r\nby the attempt of Archbishop Laud to impose the English liturgy on the\r\nScottish nation, and supplant Presbyterianism by Episcopacy. The\r\nrevolutions in Scotland, from the time of Knox, had been popular; not\r\nproduced by great men, but by the diffusion of great ideas. The people\r\nbelieved in the spiritual independence of their church, and not in the\r\nsupremacy of a king. The instant, therefore, that the Episcopal\r\nworship was introduced, by authority, in the cathedral of Edinburgh,\r\nthere was an insurrection, which rapidly spread through all parts of\r\nthe country. An immense multitude came to Edinburgh to protest against\r\nthe innovation, and crowded all the houses, streets, and halls of the\r\ncity. The king ordered the petitioners home, without answering their\r\ncomplaints. They obeyed the injunction, but soon returned in greater\r\nnumbers. An organization of resistance was made, and a provisional\r\ngovernment appointed. All classes joined the insurgents, who, menaced,\r\nbut united, at last bound themselves, by a solemn league and covenant,\r\nnot to separate until their rights and liberties were secured. A vast\r\nmajority of all the population of Scotland--gentlemen, clergy,\r\ncitizens, and laborers, men, women, and children--assembled in the\r\nchurch, and swore fealty to the covenant. Force, of course, was\r\nnecessary to reduce the rebels, and civil war commenced in Scotland.\r\nBut war increased the necessities of the king, and he was compelled to\r\nmake peace with the insurgent army.\r\n\r\nEleven years had now elapsed since the dissolution of the last\r\nparliament, during which the king had attempted to rule without one,\r\nand had resorted to all the expedients that the ingenuity of the crown\r\nlawyers could suggest, in order to extort money. Imposts fallen into\r\ndesuetude, monopolies abandoned by Elizabeth, royal forests extended\r\nbeyond the limits they had in feudal times, fines past all endurance,\r\nconfiscations without end, imprisonments, tortures, and\r\nexecutions,--all marked these eleven years. The sum for fines alone,\r\nin this period, amounted to more than two hundred thousand pounds. The\r\nforest of Rockingham was enlarged from six to sixty miles in circuit,\r\nand the earl of Salisbury was fined twenty thousand pounds for\r\nencroaching upon it. Individuals and companies had monopolies of salt,\r\nsoap, coals, iron, wine, leather, starch, feathers, tobacco, beer,\r\ndistilled liquors, herrings, butter, potash, linen cloth, rags, hops,\r\ngunpowder, and divers other articles, which, of course, deranged the\r\nwhole trade of the country. Prynne was fined ten thousand pounds, and\r\nhad his ears cut off, and his nose slit, for writing an offensive\r\nbook; and his sufferings were not greater than what divers others\r\nexperienced for vindicating the cause of truth and liberty.\r\n\r\nAt last, the king\'s necessities compelled him to summon another\r\nparliament. He had exhausted every expedient to raise money. His army\r\nclamored for pay; and he was overburdened with debts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Long Parliament.]\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of April, 1640, the new parliament met. It knew its\r\nstrength, and was determined now, more than ever, to exercise it. It\r\nimmediately took the power into its own hands, and from remonstrances\r\nand petitions it proceeded to actual hostilities; from the\r\ndenunciation of injustice and illegality, it proceeded to trample on\r\nthe constitution itself. It is true that the members were irritated\r\nand threatened, and some of their number had been seized and\r\nimprisoned. It is true that the king continued his courses, and was\r\nresolved on enforcing his measures by violence. The struggle became\r\none of desperation on both sides--a struggle for ascendency--and not\r\nfor rights.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the House of Commons was the impeachment of\r\nStrafford. He had been just summoned from Ireland, where, as lord\r\nlieutenant, he had exercised almost regal power and regal audacity; he\r\nhad been summoned by his perplexed and desponding master to assist him\r\nby his counsels. Reluctantly he obeyed, foreseeing the storm. He had\r\nscarcely arrived in London when the intrepid Pym accused him of high\r\ntreason. The Lords accepted the accusation, and the imperious minister\r\nwas committed to the Tower.\r\n\r\nThe impeachment of Laud soon followed; but he was too sincere in his\r\ntyranny to understand why he should be committed. Nor was he feared,\r\nas Strafford was, against whom the vengeance of the parliament was\r\nespecially directed. A secret committee, invested with immense powers,\r\nwas commissioned to scrutinize his whole life, and his destruction was\r\nresolved upon. On the 22d of March his trial began, and lasted\r\nseventeen days, during which time, unaided, he defended himself\r\nagainst thirteen accusers, with consummate ability. Indeed, he had\r\nstudied his charges and despised his adversaries. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, he would have been acquitted, for there was not\r\nsufficient evidence to convict him of high treason; but an\r\nunscrupulous and infuriated body of men were thirsting for his blood,\r\nand it was proposed to convict him by bill of attainder; that is, by\r\nact of parliament, on its own paramount authority, with or without the\r\nlaw. The bill passed, in spite of justice, in spite of the eloquence\r\nof the attainted earl. He was condemned, and remanded to the Tower.\r\n\r\nHad the king been strong he would have saved his minister; had he been\r\nmagnanimous, he would have stood by him to the last. But he had\r\nneither the power to save him, nor the will to make adequate\r\nsacrifices. He feebly interposed, but finally yielded, and gave his\r\nconsent to the execution of the main agent of all his aggressions on\r\nthe constitution he had sworn to maintain. Strafford deserved his\r\nfate, although the manner of his execution was not according to law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rebellion of Ireland.]\r\n\r\nA few months after the execution of Strafford, an event occurred which\r\nproved exceedingly unfortunate to the royal cause; and this was the\r\nrebellion of Ireland, and the massacre of the Protestant population,\r\ncaused, primarily, by the oppressive government of England, and the\r\nharsh and severe measures of the late lord lieutenant. In the course\r\nof a few weeks, the English and Scottish colonies seemed almost\r\nuprooted; one of the most frightful butcheries was committed that ever\r\noccurred. The Protestants exaggerated their loss; but it is probable\r\nthat at least fifty thousand were massacred. The local government of\r\nDublin was paralyzed. The English nation was filled with deadly and\r\nimplacable hostility, not against the Irish merely, but against the\r\nCatholics every where. It was supposed that there was a general\r\nconspiracy among the Catholics to destroy the whole nation; and it was\r\nwhispered that the queen herself had aided the revolted Irish. The\r\nmost vigorous measures were adopted to raise money and troops for\r\nIreland. The Commons took occasion of the general spirit of discontent\r\nand insurrection to prepare a grand remonstrance on the evils of the\r\nkingdom, which were traced to a "coalition of Papists, Arminian\r\nbishops and clergymen, and evil courtiers and counsellors." The\r\nCommons recited all the evils of the last sixteen years, and declared\r\nthe necessity of taking away the root of them, which was the arbitrary\r\npower of the sovereign. The king, in reply, told the Commons that\r\ntheir remonstrance was unparliamentary; that he could not understand\r\nwhat they meant by a wicked party; that bishops were entitled to their\r\nvotes in parliament; and that, as to the removal of evil counsellors,\r\nthey must name whom they were. The remonstrance was printed and\r\ncirculated by the Commons, which was of more effect than an army could\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\nThus were affairs rapidly reaching a crisis, when the attempt to seize\r\nfive of the most refractory and able members of parliament consummated\r\nit. The members were Hollis, Hazelrig, Pym, Hampden, and Strode; and\r\nthey were accused of high treason. This movement of the king was one\r\nof the greatest blunders and one of the most unconstitutional acts he\r\never committed. The Commons refused to surrender their members; and\r\nthen the king went down to the house, with an armed force, to seize\r\nthem. But Pym and others got intelligence of the design of Charles,\r\nand had time to withdraw before he arrived. "The baffled tyrant\r\nreturned to Whitehall with his company of bravoes," while the city of\r\nLondon sheltered Hampden and his friends. The shops were shut, the\r\nstreets were filled with crowds, and the greatest excitement\r\nprevailed. The friends of Charles, who were inclined to constitutional\r\nmeasures, were filled with shame. It was now feared that the king\r\nwould not respect his word or the constitution, and, with all his\r\npromises, was still bent on tyrannical courses. All classes, but\r\nbigoted royalists, now felt that something must be done promptly, or\r\nthat their liberties would be subverted.\r\n\r\nThen it was, and not till then, that the Commons openly defied him,\r\nwhile the king remained in his palace, humbled, dismayed, and\r\nbewildered, "feeling," says Clarendon, "the trouble and agony which\r\nusually attend generous minds upon their having committed errors;" or,\r\nas Macaulay says, "the despicable repentance which attends the\r\nbungling villain, who, having attempted to commit a crime, finds that\r\nhe has only committed a folly."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of the King from London.]\r\n\r\nIn a few days, the king fled from Whitehall, which he was never\r\ndestined to see again till he was led through it to the scaffold. He\r\nwent into the country to raise forces to control the parliament, and\r\nthe parliament made vigorous measures to put itself and the kingdom in\r\na state of resistance. On the 23d of April, the king, with three\r\nhundred horse, advanced to Hull, and were refused admission by the\r\ngovernor. This was tantamount to a declaration of war. It was so\r\nconsidered. Thirty-two Lords, and sixty members of the Commons\r\ndeparted for York to join the king. The parliament decreed an army,\r\nand civil war began.\r\n\r\nBefore this can be traced we must consider the Puritans, which is\r\nnecessary in order fully to appreciate the Revolution. The reign of\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0I. was now virtually ended, and that of the Parliament and\r\nCromwell had begun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of the Puritans.]\r\n\r\nDissensions among the Protestants themselves did not occur until the\r\nreign of Elizabeth, and were first caused by difficulties about a\r\nclerical dress, which again led to the advocacy of simpler forms of\r\nworship, stricter rules of life, more definite forms of faith, and\r\nmore democratic principles of government, both ecclesiastical and\r\ncivil. The first promoters of these opinions were the foreign divines\r\nwho came from Geneva, at the invitation of Cranmer, of whom Peter\r\nMartyr, Martin Bucer, John \xc3\xa0 Lasco, were the most distinguished. Some\r\nEnglishmen, also, who had been travelling on the continent, brought\r\nwith them the doctrines of Calvin. Among these was Hooper, who, on\r\nbeing nominated to the bishopric of Gloucester, refused to submit to\r\nthe appointed form of consecration and admission. He objected to what\r\nhe called the _Aaronical_ habits--the square cap, tippet, and\r\nsurplice, worn by bishops. But dissent became more marked and\r\ndetermined when the exiles returned to England, on the accession of\r\nElizabeth, and who were for advancing the reformation according to\r\ntheir own standard. The queen and her advisers, generally, were\r\ncontent with King Edward\'s liturgy; but the majority of the exiles\r\ndesired the simpler services of Geneva. The new bishops, most of whom\r\nhad been their companions abroad, endeavored to soften them for the\r\npresent, declaring that they would use all their influence at court to\r\nsecure them indulgence. The queen herself connived at non-conformity,\r\nuntil her government was established, but then firmly declared that\r\nshe had fixed her standard, and insisted on her subjects conforming to\r\nit. The bishops, seeing this, changed their conduct, explained away\r\ntheir promises, and became severe towards their dissenting brethren.\r\n\r\nThe standard of the queen was the Thirty-Nine Articles. She admitted\r\nthat the Scriptures were the sole rule of faith, but declared that\r\nindividuals must interpret Scripture as expounded in the articles and\r\nformularies of the English church, in violation of the great principle\r\nof Protestantism, which even the Puritans themselves did not fully\r\nrecognize--the right and the duty of every individual to interpret\r\nScripture himself, whether his interpretation interfered with the\r\nEstablished Church or not.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Original Difficulties and Differences.]\r\n\r\nThe first dissenters did not claim this right, but only urged that\r\ncertain points, about which they felt scruples, should be left as\r\nmatters indifferent. On all essential points, they, as well as the\r\nstrictest conformists, believed in the necessity of a uniformity of\r\npublic worship, and of using the sword of the magistrate in defence of\r\ntheir doctrines. The standard of conformity, according to the bishops,\r\nwas the queen\'s supremacy and the laws of the land; according to the\r\nPuritans, the decrees of provincial and national synods.\r\n\r\nAt first, many of the Puritans overcame their scruples so far as to\r\ncomply with the required oath and accept livings in the Establishment.\r\nBut they indulged in many irregularities, which, during the first year\r\nof the reign of Elizabeth, were winked at by the authorities. "Some\r\nperformed," says an old author, "divine service in the chancel, others\r\nin the body of the church; some in a seat made in the church; some in\r\na pulpit, with their faces to the people; some keeping precisely to\r\nthe order of the book; some intermix psalms in metre; some say with a\r\nsurplice, and others without one. The table stands in the body of the\r\nchurch in some places, in others it stands in the chancel; in some\r\nplaces the table stands altarwise, distant from the wall a yard, in\r\nothers in the middle of the chancel, north and south. Some administer\r\nthe communion with surplice and cap, some with a surplice alone,\r\nothers with none; some with chalice, others with a communion cup,\r\nothers with a common cup; some with unleavened bread, and some with\r\nleavened; some receive kneeling, others standing, others sitting; some\r\nbaptize in a font, some in a basin; some sign with the sign of the\r\ncross, other sign not; some minister with a surplice, others without;\r\nsome with a square cap, others with a round cap; some with a button\r\ncap, and some with a hat, some in scholar\'s clothes, some in common\r\nclothes."\r\n\r\nThese differences in public worship, which, by many, were considered\r\nas indifferent matters, and by others were unduly magnified, seem to\r\nhave constituted the chief peculiarity of the early Puritans. In\r\nregard to the queen\'s supremacy, the union of church and state, the\r\nnecessity of supporting religion by law, and articles of theological\r\nbelief, there was no disagreement. Most of the non-conformists were\r\nmen of learning and piety, and among the ornaments of the church.\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan bishop, at this time, was Parker, a great stickler\r\nfor the forms of the church, and very intolerant in all his opinions.\r\nHe and others of the bishops had been appointed as commissioners to\r\ninvestigate the causes of dissent, and to suspend all who refused to\r\nconform to the rubric of the church. Hence arose the famous Court of\r\nthe Ecclesiastical Commission, so much abused during the reigns of\r\nJames and Charles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persecution during the Reign of Elizabeth.]\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of Parker, great numbers were suspended from their\r\nlivings for non-conformity, and sent to wander in a state of\r\ndestitution. Among these were some of the most learned men in the\r\nchurch. They had no means of defence or livelihood, and resorted to\r\nthe press in order to vindicate their opinions. For this they were\r\neven more harshly dealt with; an order was issued from the Star\r\nChamber, that no person should print a book against the queen\'s\r\ninjunctions, upon the penalty of fines and imprisonment; and authority\r\nwas given to church-wardens to search all suspected places where books\r\nmight be concealed. Great multitudes suffered in consequence of these\r\ntyrannical laws.\r\n\r\nBut the non-conformists were further molested. They were forbidden to\r\nassemble together to read the Scriptures and pray, but were required\r\nto attend regularly the churches of the Establishment, on penalty of\r\nheavy fines for neglect.\r\n\r\nAt length, worried, disgusted, and irritated, they resolved upon\r\nsetting up the Genevan service, and upon withdrawing entirely from the\r\nChurch of England. The separation, once made, (1566,) became wider and\r\nwider, and the Puritans soon after opposed the claims of bishops as a\r\nsuperior order of the clergy. They were opposed to the temporal\r\ndignities annexed to the episcopal office to the titles and office of\r\narchdeacons, deans, and chapters; to the jurisdiction of spiritual\r\ncourts; to the promiscuous access of all persons to the communion; to\r\nthe liturgy; to the prohibition, in the public service of prayer, by\r\nthe clergyman himself; to the use of godfathers and godmothers; to the\r\ncustom of confirmation; to the cathedral worship and organs; to\r\npluralities and non-residency; to the observance of Lent and of the\r\nholy days; and to the appointment of ministers by the crown, bishops,\r\nor lay patrons, instead of election by the people.\r\n\r\nThe schism was now complete, and had grown out of such small\r\ndifferences as refusing to bow at the name of Jesus, and to use the\r\ncross in baptism.\r\n\r\nIn our times, the Puritans would have been permitted to worship God in\r\ntheir own way, but they were not thus allowed in the time of\r\nElizabeth. Religious toleration was not then understood or practised;\r\nand it was the fault of the age, since the Puritans themselves, when\r\nthey obtained the power, persecuted with great severity the Quakers\r\nand the Catholics. But, during the whole reign of Elizabeth,\r\nespecially the life of Archbishop Parker, they were in a minority, and\r\nsuffered--as minorities ever have suffered--all the miseries which\r\nunreasonable majorities could inflict.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Archbishops Grindal and Whitgift.]\r\n\r\nArchbishop Grindal, who succeeded Parker in 1575, recommended milder\r\nmeasures to the queen; but she had no charity for those who denied the\r\nsupremacy of her royal conscience.\r\n\r\nGrindal was succeeded, in 1583, by Dr. Whitgift, the antagonist of the\r\nlearned Dr. Cartwright, and he proved a ruler of the church according\r\nto her majesty\'s mind. He commenced a most violent crusade against the\r\nnon-conformists, and was so harsh, cruel, and unreasonable, that\r\nCecil--Lord Burleigh--was obliged to remonstrate, being much more\r\nenlightened than the prelate. "I have read over," said he, "your\r\ntwenty-four articles, and I find them so curiously penned, that I\r\nthink that the Spanish Inquisition used not so many questions to\r\nentrap the priests." Nevertheless fines, imprisonment, and the gibbet\r\ncontinued to do their work in the vain attempt to put down opinions,\r\ntill within four or five years of the queen\'s death when there was a\r\ncessation of persecution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persecution under James.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Puritans in Exile.]\r\n\r\nBut the Scottish Solomon, as James was called, renewed the severity\r\nwhich Elizabeth found it wise to remit. Hitherto, the Puritans had\r\nbeen chiefly Presbyterians; but now the Independents arose, who\r\ncarried their views still further, even to wildness and radicalism.\r\nThey were stricter Calvinists, and inclined to republican views of\r\ncivil government. Consequently, they were still more odious than were\r\nthe Presbyterians to an arbitrary government. They were now persecuted\r\nfor their doctrines of faith, as well as for their forms of worship.\r\nThe Church of England retained the thirty-nine articles; but many of\r\nher leading clergy sympathized with the views of Arminius, and among\r\nthem was the primate himself. So strictly were Arminian doctrines\r\ncherished, that no person under a dean was permitted to discourse on\r\npredestination, election, reprobation, efficacy, or universality of\r\nGod\'s grace. And the king himself would hear no doctrines preached,\r\nexcept those he had condemned at the synod of Dort. But this act was\r\naimed against the Puritans, who, of all parties, were fond of\r\npreaching on what was called "the Five Points of Calvinism." But they\r\npaid dearly for their independence. James absolutely detested them,\r\nregarded them as a sect insufferable in a well-governed commonwealth,\r\nand punished them with the greatest severity. Their theological\r\ndoctrines, their notions of church government, and, above all, their\r\nspirit of democratic liberty, were odious and repulsive. Archbishop\r\nBancroft, who succeeded Whitgift in 1604, went beyond all his\r\npredecessors in bigotry, but had not their commanding intellects. His\r\nmeasures were so injudicious, so vexatious, so annoying, so severe,\r\nand so cruel, that the Puritans became, if possible, still more\r\nestranged. With the popular discontents, and with the progress of\r\npersecution, their numbers increased, both in Scotland and England.\r\nWith the increase of Puritanism was also a corresponding change in the\r\nChurch of England, since ceremony and forms increased almost to a\r\nrevival of Catholicism. And this reaction towards Rome, favored by the\r\ncourt, incensed still more the Puritans, and led to language\r\nunnecessarily violent and abusive on their side. Their controversial\r\ntracts were pervaded with a spirit of bitterness and treason which, in\r\nthe opinion of James, fully justified the imprisonments, fines, and\r\nmutilations which his minister inflicted. The Puritans, in despair,\r\nfled to Holland, and from thence to New England, to establish, amid\r\nits barren hills and desolate forests, that worship which alone they\r\nthought would be acceptable to God. Persecution elevated them, and\r\nnone can deny that they were characterized by moral virtues and a\r\nspirit of liberty which no people ever before or since exhibited.\r\nAlmost their only fault was intolerance respecting the opinions and\r\npleasures of many good people who did not join their ranks.\r\n\r\nJames\'s death did not remit their sufferings; but, by this time, they\r\nhad so multiplied that they became a party too formidable to be\r\ncrushed. The High Commission Court and the Star Chamber still filled\r\nthe prisons and pillories with victims; but every sentence of these\r\ncourts fanned the flame of discontent, and hastened the catastrophe\r\nwhich was rapidly approaching. The volcano, over whose fearful brink\r\nthe royal family and the haughty hierarchy were standing, was now\r\nsending forth those frightful noises which indicated approaching\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nDuring the years that Charles dispensed with the parliaments, when\r\nLaud was both minister and archbishop, the persecution reached its\r\nheight, and also popular discontent. During this period, the greatest\r\nemigration was made to New England, and even Hampden and Cromwell\r\ncontemplated joining their brethren in America. Arianism and Popery\r\nadvanced with Puritanism, and all parties prepared for the approaching\r\ncontest. The advocates of royal usurpation became more unreasonable,\r\nthe friends of popular liberty became more violent. Those who had the\r\npower, exercised it without reflection. The history of the times is\r\nsimply this--despotism striving to put Puritanism and liberty beneath\r\nits feet, and Puritanism aiming to subvert the crown.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest commotions were in Scotland, where the people were\r\ngenerally Presbyterians; and it was the zeal of Archbishop Laud in\r\nsuppressing these, and attempting to change the religion of the land,\r\nwhich precipitated the ruin of Charles\xc2\xa0I.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Troubles in Scotland.]\r\n\r\nEver since the time of Knox, Scotland had been the scene of violent\r\nreligious animosities. In that country, the reformation, from the\r\nfirst, had been a popular movement. It was so impetuous, and decided\r\nunder the guidance of the uncompromising Knox, that even before the\r\ndethronement of Mary, it was complete. In the year 1592, through the\r\ninfluence of Andrew Melville, the Presbyterian government was fairly\r\nestablished, and King James is said to have thus expressed himself: "I\r\npraise God that I was born in the time of the light of the gospel, and\r\nin such a place as to be king of the purest kirk in the world." The\r\nChurch of Scotland, however, had severe struggles from the period of\r\nits institution, 1560, to the year 1584, when the papal influence was\r\nfinally destroyed by the expulsion of the earl of Arran from the\r\ncouncils of the young king. Nor did these struggles end even there.\r\nJames, perceiving that Episcopacy was much more consonant with\r\nmonarchy than Presbyterianism, attempted to remodel the Scottish\r\nchurch on the English basis, which attempt resulted in discontent and\r\nrebellion. James, however, succeeded in reducing to contempt the\r\ngeneral assemblies of the Presbyterian church, and in confirming\r\nArchbishop Spotswood in the chief administration of ecclesiastical\r\naffairs, which, it must be confessed, were regulated with great\r\nprudence and moderation.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles came to the throne, he complained of the laxity of the\r\nScotch primate, and sent him a set of rules by which he was to\r\nregulate his conduct. Charles also added new dignities to his see, and\r\nordained that he, as primate, should take precedence over all the\r\ntemporal lords, which irritated the proud Scotch nobility. He moreover\r\ncontemplated the recovery of tithes and church lands for the benefit\r\nof the Episcopal government, and the imposition of a liturgy on the\r\nScotch nation, a great majority of whom were Presbyterians. This was\r\nthe darling scheme of Laud, who believed that there could scarcely be\r\nsalvation out of his church, and which church he strove to make as\r\nmuch like the Catholic as possible, and yet maintain independence of\r\nthe pope. But nothing was absolutely done towards changing the\r\nreligion of Scotland until Charles came down to Edinburgh (1633) to be\r\ncrowned, when a liturgy was prepared for the Scotch nation, subjected\r\nto the revision of Laud, but which was not submitted to or seen by,\r\nthe General Assembly, or any convocation of ministers in Scotland.\r\nNothing could be more ill timed or ill judged than this conflict with\r\nthe religious prejudices of a people zealously attached to their own\r\nforms of worship. The clergy united with the aristocracy, and both\r\nwith the people, in denouncing the conduct of the king and his\r\nministers as tyrannical and unjust. The canons, especially, which Laud\r\nhad prepared, were, in the eyes of the Scotch, puerile and\r\nsuperstitious; they could not conceive why a Protestant prelate should\r\nmake so much account of the position of the font or of the communion\r\ntable, turned into an altar. Indeed, his liturgy was not much other\r\nthan an English translation of the Roman Missal, and excited the\r\ndetestation of all classes. Yet it was resolved to introduce it into\r\nthe churches, and the day was fixed for its introduction, which was\r\nEaster Sunday, 1637. But such a ferment was produced, that the\r\nexperiment was put off to Sunday, 23d of July. On that day, the\r\narchbishops and bishops, lords of session, and magistrates were all\r\npresent, by command, in the Church of St. Giles. But no sooner had the\r\ndean opened the service book, and begun to read out of it, than the\r\npeople, who had assembled in great crowds, began to fill the church\r\nwith uproar. The bishop of Edinburgh, who was to preach, stepped into\r\nthe pulpit, and attempted to appease the tumultuous people. But this\r\nincreased the tumult, when an old woman, seizing a stool, hurled it at\r\nthe bishop\'s head. Sticks, stones, and dirt followed the stool, with\r\nloud cries of "Down with the priest of Baal!" "A pape, a pape!"\r\n"Antichrist!" "Pull him down!" This was the beginning of the\r\ninsurrection, which spread from city to village, until all Scotland\r\nwas in arms, and Episcopacy, as an established religion, was\r\nsubverted. In February, 1638, the covenant was drawn up in Edinburgh,\r\nand was subscribed to by all classes, in all parts of Scotland; and,\r\nin November, the General Assembly met in Glasgow, the first that had\r\nbeen called for twenty years, and Presbyterianism was re\xc3\xabstablished in\r\nthe kingdom, if not legally, yet in reality.\r\n\r\nFrom the day on which the Convocation opened, until the conquest of\r\nthe country by Cromwell, the Kirk reigned supreme, there being no\r\npower in the government, or in the country, able or disposed to resist\r\nor question its authority. This was the golden age of Presbyterianism,\r\nwhen the clergy enjoyed autocratic power --a sort of Druidical\r\nascendency over the minds and consciences of the people, in affairs\r\ntemporal as well as spiritual.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peculiarities of Puritanism in England.]\r\n\r\nPuritanism did not pervade the English, as it did the Scotch mind,\r\nalthough it soon obtained an ascendency. Most of the great political\r\nchieftains who controlled the House of Commons, and who clamored for\r\nthe death of Strafford and Laud, were Puritans. But they were not all\r\nPresbyterians. In England, after the flight of the king from\r\nWhitehall, the Independents attracted notice, and eventually seized\r\nthe reins of government. Cromwell was an Independent.\r\n\r\nThe difference between these two sects was chiefly in their views\r\nabout government, civil and ecclesiastical. Both Presbyterians and\r\nIndependents were rigid Calvinists, practised a severe morality, were\r\nopposed to gay amusements, disliked organs and ceremonies, strictly\r\nobserved the Sabbath, and attached great importance to the close\r\nobservance of the Mosaic ritual. The Presbyterians were not behind the\r\nEpiscopalians in hatred of sects and a free press. They had their\r\nmodel of worship, and declared it to be of divine origin. They looked\r\nupon schism as the parent of licentiousness, insisted on entire\r\nuniformity, maintained the divine right of the clergy to the\r\nmanagement of ecclesiastical affairs, and claimed the sword of the\r\nmagistrate to punish schismatics and heretics. They believed in the\r\nunion of church and state, but would give the clergy the ascendency\r\nthey possessed in the Middle Ages. They did not desire the entire\r\nprostration of royal authority, but only aimed to limit and curtail\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Independents wished a total disruption of church and state, and\r\ndisliked synods almost as much as they did bishops. They believed that\r\nevery congregation was a distinct church, and had a right to elect the\r\npastor. They preferred the greatest variety of sects to the ascendency\r\nof any one, by means of the civil sword. They rejected all spiritual\r\ncourts, and claimed the right of each church to reject, punish, or\r\nreceive members. In politics, they wished a total overthrow of the\r\ngovernment--monarchy, aristocracy, and prelacy; and were averse to any\r\npeace which did not secure complete toleration of opinions, and the\r\ncomplete subversion of the established order of things.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conflicts among the Puritans.]\r\n\r\nBetween the Presbyterians and the Independents, therefore, there could\r\nnot be any lasting sympathy or alliance. They only united to crush the\r\ncommon foe; and, when Charles was beheaded, and Cromwell installed in\r\npower, they turned their arms against each other.\r\n\r\nThe great religious contest, after the rise of Cromwell, was not\r\nbetween the Puritans and the Episcopalians, but between the different\r\nsects of Puritans themselves. At first, the Independents harmonized\r\nwith the Presbyterians. Their theological and ethical opinions were\r\nthe same, and both cordially hated and despised the government of the\r\nStuarts. But when the Presbyterians obtained the ascendency, the\r\nIndependents were grieved and enraged to discover that religious\r\ntoleration was stigmatized as the parent of all heresy and schism.\r\nWhile in power, the Presbyterians shackled the press, and their\r\nintolerance brought out John Milton\'s famous tract on the liberty of\r\nunlicensed printing--one of the most masterly arguments which the\r\nadvocates of freedom have ever made. The idea that any dominant\r\nreligious sect should be incorporated with the political power, was\r\nthe fatal error of Presbyterianism, and raised up enemies against it,\r\nafter the royal power was suppressed. Cromwell was persuaded that the\r\ncause of religious liberty would be lost unless Presbyterianism, as\r\nwell as Episcopacy, was disconnected with the state; and hence one\r\ngreat reason of his assuming the dictatorship. And he granted a more\r\nextended toleration than had before been known in England, although it\r\nwas not perfect. The Catholics and the Quakers were not partakers of\r\nthe boon which he gave to his country; so hard is it for men to learn\r\nthe rights of others, when they have power in their own hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of the Puritans.]\r\n\r\nThe Restoration was a victory over both the Independents and the\r\ngeneral swarm of sectaries which an age of unparalleled religious\r\nexcitement had produced. It is difficult to conceive of the intensity\r\nof the passions which inflamed all parties of religious disputants.\r\nBut if the Puritan contest developed fanatical zeal, it also brought\r\nout the highest qualities of mind and heart which any age has\r\nwitnessed. With all the faults and weaknesses of the Puritans, there\r\nnever lived a better class of men,--men of more elevated piety, more\r\nenlarged views, or greater disinterestedness, patriotism, and moral\r\nworth. They made sacrifices which our age can scarcely appreciate, and\r\nhad difficulties to contend with which were unparalleled in the\r\nhistory of reform. They made blunders which approximated to crimes,\r\nbut they made them in their inexperience and zeal to promote the cause\r\nof religion and liberty. They were conscientious men--men who acted\r\nfrom the fear of God, and with a view to promote the highest welfare\r\nof future generations. They launched their bark boldly upon an unknown\r\nsea, and heroically endured its dangers and sufferings, with a view of\r\nconferring immortal blessings on their children and country. More\r\nprudent men would have avoided the perils of an unknown navigation;\r\nbut, by such men, a great experiment for humanity would not have been\r\ntried. It may have failed, but the world has learned immortal wisdom\r\nfrom the failure. But the Puritans were not mere adventurers or\r\nmartyrs. They have done something of lasting benefit to mankind, and\r\nthey have done this by the power of faith, and by loyalty to their\r\nconsciences, perverted as they were in some respects. The Puritans\r\nwere not agreeable companions to the idle, luxurious, or frivolous;\r\nthey were rigid ever, to austerity; their expressions degenerated into\r\ncant, and they were hostile to many innocent amusements. But these\r\nwere peculiarities which furnished subjects of ridicule merely, and\r\ndid not disgrace or degrade them. These were a small offset to their\r\nmoral wisdom, their firm endurance, their elevation of sentiment,\r\ntheir love of liberty, and their fear of God. Such are the men whom\r\nProvidence ordains to give impulse to society, and effect great and\r\nuseful reforms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now return to consider the changes which they attempted in\r\ngovernment. The civil war, of which Cromwell was the hero, now claims\r\nour attention.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the governor of Hull to admit the king was virtually\r\nthe declaration of war, for which both parties had vigorously\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nThe standard of the king was first raised in Nottingham, while the\r\nhead-quarters of the parliamentarians were in London. The first action\r\nof any note was the battle of Edge Hill, (October 23, 1642,) but was\r\nundecisive. Indeed, both parties hesitated to plunge into desperate\r\nwar, at least until, by skirmishings and military manoeuvres, they\r\nwere better prepared for it.\r\n\r\nThe forces of the belligerents, at this period, were nearly equal but\r\nthe parliamentarians had the ablest leaders. It was the misfortune of\r\nthe king to have no man of commanding talents, as his counsellor,\r\nafter the arrest of Strafford. Hyde, afterwards lord chancellor, and\r\nEarl of Clarendon, was the ablest of the royalist party. Falkland and\r\nCulpeper were also eminent men; but neither of them was the equal of\r\nPym or Hampden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Hampden.]\r\n\r\nThe latter was doubtless the ablest man in England at this time, and\r\nthe only one who could have saved it from the evils which afterwards\r\nafflicted it. On him the hopes and affections of the nation centred.\r\nHe was great in council and great in debate. He was the acknowledged\r\nleader of the House of Commons. He was eloquent, honest, unwearied,\r\nsagacious, and prudent. "Never had a man inspired a nation with\r\ngreater confidence: the more moderate had faith in his wisdom; the\r\nmore violent in his devoted patriotism; the more honest in his\r\nuprightness; the more intriguing in his talents." He spared neither\r\nhis fortune nor his person, as soon as hostilities were inevitable. He\r\nsubscribed two thousand pounds to the public cause, took a colonel\'s\r\ncommission, and raised a regiment of infantry, so well known during\r\nthe war for its green uniform, and the celebrated motto of its\r\nintrepid leader,--"_Vestigia nulla retrorsum_." He possessed the\r\ntalents of a great statesman and a great general, and all the united\r\nqualities requisite for the crisis in which he appeared--"the valor\r\nand energy of Cromwell, the discernment and eloquence of Vane, the\r\nhumanity and moderation of Manchester, the stern integrity of Hale,\r\nthe ardent public spirit of Sydney. Others could conquer; he alone\r\ncould reconcile. A heart as bold as his brought up the cuirassiers who\r\nturned the tide of battle on Marston Moor. As skilful an eye as his\r\nwatched the Scottish army descending from the heights over Dunbar. But\r\nit was when, to the sullen tyranny of Laud and Charles, had succeeded\r\nthe fierce conflict of sects and factions, ambitious of ascendency,\r\nand burning for revenge; it was when the vices and ignorance, which\r\nthe old tyranny had generated, threatened the new freedom with\r\ndestruction, that England missed that sobriety, that self-command,\r\nthat perfect soundness of judgment, that perfect rectitude of\r\nintention, to which the history of revolutions furnishes no parallel,\r\nor furnishes a parallel in Washington alone."[1]\r\n\r\n               [Footnote 1: Macaulay.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oliver Cromwell.]\r\n\r\nThis great man was removed by Providence from the scene of violence\r\nand faction at an early period of the contest. He was mortally wounded\r\nin one of those skirmishes in which the detachments of both armies had\r\nthus far engaged, and which made the campaigns of 1642-3 so undecided,\r\nso tedious, and so irritating--campaigns in which the generals of both\r\narmies reaped no laurels, and which created the necessity for a\r\ngreater genius than had thus far appeared. That genius was Oliver\r\nCromwell. At the battle of Edge Hill he was only captain of a troop of\r\nhorse, and at the death of his cousin Hampden, he was only colonel. He\r\nwas indeed a member of the Long Parliament, as was Hampden, and had\r\nsecured the attention of the members in spite of his slovenly\r\nappearance and his incoherent, though earnest speeches. Under his\r\nrough and clownish exterior, his talents were not perceived, except by\r\ntwo or three penetrating intellects; but they were shortly to appear,\r\nand to be developed, not in the House of Commons, but on the field of\r\nbattle. The rise of Oliver Cromwell can scarcely be dated until the\r\ndeath of John Hampden; nor were the eyes of the nation fixed on him,\r\nas their deliverer, until some time after. The Earl of Essex was still\r\nthe commander of the forces, while the Earl of Bedford, Lord\r\nManchester, Lord Fairfax, Skippon, Sir William Waller, Leslie, and\r\nothers held high posts. Cromwell was still a subordinate; but genius\r\nbreaks through all obstacles, and overleaps all boundaries. The time\r\nhad not yet come for the exercise of his great military talents. The\r\nperiod of negotiation had not fully passed, and the king, at his\r\nhead-quarters at Oxford, "that seat of pure, unspotted loyalty," still\r\nhoped to amuse the parliament, gain time, and finally overwhelm its\r\nforces. Prince Rupert--brave, ardent, reckless, unprincipled--still\r\nravaged the country without reaping any permanent advantage. The\r\nparliament was perplexed and the people were disappointed. On the\r\nwhole, the king\'s forces were in the ascendant, and were augmenting;\r\nwhile plots and insurrections were constantly revealing to the\r\nparliamentarians the dangers which threatened them. Had not an able\r\nleader, at this crisis, appeared among the insurgents, or had an able\r\ngeneral been given to Charles, it is probable that the king would have\r\nsecured his ends; for popular enthusiasm without the organization\r\nwhich a master spirit alone can form, soon burns itself out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The King at Oxford.]\r\n\r\nThe state of the contending parties, from the battle of Edge Hill, for\r\nnearly two years, was very singular and very complicated. The king\r\nremained at Oxford, distracted by opposing counsels, and perplexed by\r\nvarious difficulties. The head-quarters of his enemies, at London,\r\nwere no less the seat of intrigues and party animosities. The\r\nPresbyterians were the most powerful, and were nearly as distrustful\r\nof the Independents as they were of the king, and feared a victory\r\nover the king nearly as much as they did a defeat by him, and the\r\ndissensions among the various sects and leaders were no secret in the\r\nroyalist camp, and doubtless encouraged Charles in his endless\r\nintrigues and dissimulations. But he was not equal to decisive\r\nmeasures, and without them, in revolutionary times, any party must be\r\nruined. While he was meditating and scheming, he heard the news of an\r\nalliance between Scotland and the parliament, in which the\r\nPresbyterian interest was in the ascendency. This was the first great\r\nblow he received since the commencement of the war, and the united\r\nforces of his enemies now resolved upon more vigorous measures.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the campaign, the parliament had five armies--that\r\nof the Scots, of twenty-one thousand; that of Essex, ten thousand five\r\nhundred; that of Waller, five thousand one hundred; that of\r\nManchester, fourteen thousand; and that of Fairfax, five thousand five\r\nhundred--in all, about fifty-six thousand men, of whom the committee\r\nof the two kingdoms had the entire disposal. In May, Essex and Waller\r\ninvested Oxford, while Fairfax, Manchester, and the Scots met under\r\nthe walls of York. Thus these two great royalist cities were attacked\r\nat once by all the forces of parliament. Charles, invested by a\r\nstronger force, and being deprived of the assistance of the princes,\r\nRupert and Maurice, his nephews, who were absent on their marauding\r\nexpeditions, escaped from Oxford, and proceeded towards Exeter. In the\r\nmean time, he ordered Prince Rupert to advance to the relief of York,\r\nwhich was defended by the marquis of Newcastle. The united royalist\r\narmy now amounted to twenty-six thousand men, with a numerous and well\r\nappointed cavalry; and this great force obliged the armies of the\r\nparliament to raise the siege of York. Had Rupert been contented with\r\nthis success, and intrenched himself in the strongest city of the\r\nnorth of England, he and Newcastle might have maintained their ground;\r\nbut Rupert, against the advice of Newcastle, resolved on an engagement\r\nwith the parliamentary generals, who had retreated to Marston Moor, on\r\nthe banks of the Ouse, five miles from the city.\r\n\r\nThe next day after the relief of York was fought the famous battle of\r\nMarston Moor, (July 2, 1644,) the bloodiest in the war, which resulted\r\nin the entire discomfiture of the royalist forces, and the ruin of the\r\nroyal interests at the north. York was captured in a few days. Rupert\r\nretreated to Lancashire to recruit his army, and Newcastle, disgusted\r\nwith Rupert, and with the turn affairs had taken, withdrew beyond\r\nseas. The Scots soon stormed the town of Newcastle, and the whole\r\nnorth of England fell into the hands of the victors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cromwell after the Battle.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enthusiasm of the Independents.]\r\n\r\nThis great battle was decided by the ability of Cromwell, now\r\nlieutenant-general in the army of the parliament. He had distinguished\r\nhimself in all subordinate stations, in the field of battle, in\r\nraising forces, and in councils of war, for which he had been promoted\r\nto serve as second under the Earl of Manchester. But his remarkable\r\nmilitary genius was not apparent to the parliament until the battle of\r\nMarston Moor, and on him the eyes of the nation now began to be\r\ncentred. He was now forty-five years of age, in the vigor of his\r\nmanhood, burning with religious enthusiasm, and eager to deliver his\r\ncountry from the tyranny of Charles\xc2\xa0I., and of all kings. He was an\r\nIndependent and a radical, opposed to the Episcopalians, to the\r\nPresbyterians, to the Scots, to all moderate men, to all moderate\r\nmeasures, to all jurisdiction in matters of religion, and to all\r\nauthority in political affairs, which did not directly emanate from\r\nthe people, who were called upon to regulate themselves by their\r\nindividual reason. He was the idol of the Independent party, which now\r\nbegan to gain the ascendency in that stormy crisis. For three years,\r\nthe Presbyterians had been in the ascendant, but had not realized the\r\nhopes or expectations of the enthusiastic advocates of freedom. By\r\nturns imperious and wavering, fanatical and moderate, they sought to\r\ncurtail and humble the king, not to ruin him; to depress Episcopacy,\r\nbut to establish another religion by the sword of the magistrate.\r\nTheir leaders were timid, insincere, and disunited; few among them had\r\ndefinite views respecting the future government of the realm: and they\r\ngradually lost the confidence of the nation. But the Independents\r\nreposed fearlessly on the greatness and grandeur of their abstract\r\nprinciples, and pronounced, without a scruple, those potent words\r\nwhich kindled a popular enthusiasm--equality of rights, the just\r\ndistribution of property, and the removal of all abuses. Above all,\r\nthey were enthusiasts in religion, as well as in liberty, and devoutly\r\nattached to the doctrines of Calvin. They abominated all pleasures and\r\npursuits which diverted their minds from the contemplation of God, or\r\nthe reality of a future state. Cromwell himself lived in the ecstasy\r\nof religious excitement. His language was the language of the Bible,\r\nand its solemn truths were not dogmas, but convictions to his ardent\r\nmind. In the ardor of his zeal and the frenzy of his hopes, he fondly\r\nfancied that the people of England were to rise in simultaneous\r\nconfederation, shake off all the old shackles of priests and kings,\r\nand be governed in all their actions, by the principles of the Bible.\r\nA sort of Jewish theocracy was to be restored on earth, and he was to\r\nbe the organ of the divine will, as was Joshua of old, when he led the\r\nIsraelites against the pagan inhabitants of the promised land. Up to\r\nthis time, no inconsistencies disgraced him. His prayers and his\r\nexhortations were in accordance with his actions, and the most\r\nscrutinizing malignity could attribute nothing to him but sincerity\r\nand ardor in the cause which he had so warmly espoused. As magistrate,\r\nas member of parliament, as farmer, or as general, he slighted no\r\nreligious duties, and was devoted to the apparent interests of\r\nEngland. Such a man, so fervent, enthusiastic, honest, patriotic, and\r\nable, of course was pointed out as a future leader, especially when\r\nhis great military talents were observed at Marston Moor. From the\r\nmemorable 2d of July he became the most marked and influential man in\r\nEngland. Hampden had offered up his life as a martyr, and Pym, the\r\ngreat lawyer and statesman, had died from exhaustion. Essex had won no\r\nvictory commensurate with the public expectations, and Waller lost his\r\narmy by desertions and indecisive measures. Both Essex and Manchester,\r\nwith their large estates, their aristocratic connections, and their\r\nPresbyterian sympathies, were afraid of treating the king too well.\r\nThe battle of Newbury, which shortly after was gained by the\r\nparliamentarians, was without decisive results, in consequence of the\r\nindecision of Manchester. The parliament and the nation looked for\r\nanother leader, who would pursue his advantages, and adopt more\r\nvigorous measures. At this point, the Presbyterians would have made\r\npeace with the king, who still continued his insincere negotiations;\r\nbut it was too late. The Independents had gained the ascendency, and\r\ntheir voice was for war--no more dallying, no more treaties, no more\r\nhalf measures, but uncompromising war. It was plain that either the\r\nking or the Independents must be the absolute rulers of England.\r\n\r\nThen was passed (April 3, 1645) the famous Self-Denying Ordinance, by\r\nwhich all members of parliament were excluded from command in the\r\narmy, an act designed to get rid of Essex and Manchester, and prepare\r\nthe way for the elevation of Cromwell. Sir Thomas Fairfax was\r\nappointed to the supreme command, and Cromwell was despatched into the\r\ninland counties to raise recruits. But it was soon obvious that the\r\narmy could do nothing without him, although it was remodelled and\r\nre\xc3\xabnforced; and even Fairfax and his officers petitioned parliament\r\nthat Cromwell might be appointed lieutenant-general again, and\r\ncommander-in-chief of the horse; which request was granted, and\r\nCromwell rejoined the army, of which he was its hope and idol.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Naseby.]\r\n\r\nHe joined it in time to win the most decisive battle of the war, the\r\nbattle of Naseby, June 14, 1645. The forces of both armies were nearly\r\nbalanced, and the royalists were commanded by the king in person,\r\nassisted by his ablest generals. But the rout of the king\'s forces was\r\ncomplete, his fortunes were prostrated, and he was driven, with the\r\nremnants of his army, from one part of the kingdom to the other, while\r\nthe victorious parliamentarians were filled with exultation and joy.\r\nCromwell, however, was modest and composed, and ascribed the victory\r\nto the God of battles, whose servant, he fancied, he pre\xc3\xabminently was.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Success of the Parliamentary Army.]\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary army continued its successes. Montrose gained the\r\nbattle of Alford; Bridgewater surrendered to Fairfax; Glasgow and\r\nEdinburgh surrendered to Montrose; Prince Rupert was driven from\r\nBristol, and, as the king thought, most disgracefully, which\r\nmisfortune gave new joy to the parliament, and caused new\r\nthanksgivings from Cromwell, who gained the victory. From Bristol, the\r\narmy turned southward, and encountered what royalist force there was\r\nin that quarter, stormed Bridgewater, drove the royalist generals into\r\nCornwall, took Winchester, battered down Basing House, rich in\r\nprovisions, ammunition, and silver plate, and completely prostrated\r\nall the hopes of the king in the south of England. Charles fled from\r\nOxford, secretly, to join the Scottish army.\r\n\r\nBy the 24th of June, 1646, all the garrisons of England and Wales,\r\nexcept those in the north, were in the hands of the parliament. In\r\nJuly, the parliament sent their final propositions to the king at\r\nNewcastle, which were extremely humiliating, and which he rejected.\r\nNegotiations were then entered into between the parliament and the\r\nScots, which were long protracted, but which finally ended in an\r\nagreement, by the Scots, to surrender the king to the parliament, for\r\nthe payment of their dues. They accordingly marched home with an\r\ninstalment of two hundred thousand pounds, and the king was given up,\r\nnot to the Independents, but to the Commissioners of parliament, in\r\nwhich body the Presbyterian interest predominated.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, (January, 1647,) Cromwell, rather than the king, was\r\nin danger of losing his head. The Presbyterians, who did not wish to\r\nabolish royalty, but establish uniformity with their mode of worship,\r\nbegan to be extremely jealous of the Independents, who were bent on\r\nmore complete toleration of opinions, and who aimed at a total\r\noverthrow of many of the old institutions of the country. So soon as\r\nthe king was humbled, and in their hands, it was proposed to disband\r\nthe army which had gloriously finished the war, and which was chiefly\r\ncomposed of the Independents, and to create a new one on a\r\nPresbyterian model. The excuse was, that the contest was ended, while,\r\nindeed, the royalists were rather dispersed and humbled, than subdued.\r\nIt was voted that, in the reduced army, no one should have, except\r\nFairfax, a higher rank than colonel, a measure aimed directly at\r\nCromwell, now both feared and distrusted by the Presbyterians. But the\r\narmy refused to be disbanded without payment of its arrears, and,\r\nmoreover, marched upon London, in spite of the vote of the parliament\r\nthat it should not come within twenty-five miles. Several irritating\r\nresolutions were passed by the parliament, which only had the effect\r\nof uniting the army more strongly together, in resistance against\r\nparliament, as well as against the king. The Lords and Commons then\r\nvoted that the king should be brought nearer London, and new\r\nnegotiations opened with him, which were prevented from being carried\r\ninto effect by the seizure of the king at Holmby House, by Cornet\r\nJoyce, with a strong party of horse belonging to Whalley\'s regiment,\r\nprobably at the instigation of Cromwell and Ireton. His majesty was\r\nnow in the hands of the army, his worst enemy, and, though treated\r\nwith respect and deference, was really guarded closely, and watched by\r\nthe Independent generals. The same day, Cromwell left London in haste,\r\nand joined the army, knowing full well that he was in imminent danger\r\nof arrest. He was cordially received, and forthwith the army resolved\r\nnot to disband until all the national grievances were redressed, thus\r\nsetting itself up virtually against all the constituted authorities.\r\nFairfax, Cromwell, Ireton, and Hammond, with other high officers, then\r\nwaited on the king, and protested that they had nothing to do with the\r\nseizure of his person, and even invited him to return to Holmby House.\r\nBut the king never liked the Presbyterians, and was willing to remain\r\nwith the army instead, especially since he was permitted to have\r\nEpiscopal chaplains, and to see whomsoever he pleased.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seizure of the King.]\r\n\r\nThe generals of the army were not content with the seizure of his\r\nmajesty\'s person, but now caused eleven of the most obnoxious of the\r\nPresbyterian leaders of parliament to be accused, upon which they hid\r\nthemselves, while the army advanced towards London. The parliament, at\r\nfirst, made a show of resistance, but soon abandoned its course, and\r\nnow voted that the army should be treated with more respect and care.\r\nIt was evident now to all persons where the seat of power rested.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the king was removed from Newmarket to Kingston,\r\nfrom Hatfield to Woburn Abbey, and thence to Windsor Castle, which was\r\nthe scene of new intrigues and negotiations on his part, and on the\r\npart of parliament, and even on the part of Cromwell. This was the\r\nlast chance the king had. Had he cordially sided now with either the\r\nPresbyterians or the Independents, his subsequent misfortunes might\r\nhave been averted. But he hated both parties, and trifled with both,\r\nand hoped to conquer both. He was unable to see the crisis of his\r\naffairs, or to adapt himself to it. He was incapable of fair dealing\r\nwith any party. His duplicity and dissimulation were fully made known\r\nto Cromwell and Ireton by a letter of the king to his wife, which they\r\nintercepted; and they made up their minds to more decided courses. The\r\nking was more closely guarded; the army marched to the immediate\r\nvicinity of London; a committee of safety was named, and parliament\r\nwas intimidated into the passing of a resolution, by which the city of\r\nLondon and the Tower were intrusted to Fairfax and Cromwell. The\r\nPresbyterian party was forever depressed, its leading members fled to\r\nFrance, and the army had every thing after its own way. Parliament\r\nstill was ostensibly the supreme power in the land; but it was\r\nentirely controlled by the Independent leaders and generals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Triumph of the Independents.]\r\n\r\nThe victorious Independents then made their celebrated proposals to\r\nthe king, as the Presbyterians had done before them; only the\r\nconditions which the former imposed were more liberal, and would have\r\ngranted to the king powers almost as great as are now exercised by the\r\nsovereign. But he would not accept them, and continued to play his\r\ngame of kingcraft.\r\n\r\nShortly after, the king contrived to escape from Windsor to the Isle\r\nof Wight, with the connivance of Cromwell. At Carisbrook Castle, where\r\nhe quartered himself, he was more closely guarded than before. Seeing\r\nthis, he renewed his negotiations with the Scots, and attempted to\r\nescape. But escape was impossible. He was now in the hands of men who\r\naimed at his life. A strong party in the army, called the _Levellers_,\r\nopenly advocated his execution, and the establishment of a republic;\r\nand parliament itself resolved to have no further treaty with him. His\r\nonly hope was now from the Scots, and they prepared to rescue him.\r\n\r\nAlthough the government of the country was now virtually in the hands\r\nof the Independents and of the army, the state of affairs was\r\nextremely critical, and none other than Cromwell could have extricated\r\nthe dominant party from the difficulties. In one quarter was an\r\nimprisoned and intriguing king in league with the Scots, while the\r\nroyalist party was waiting for the first reverse to rise up again with\r\nnew strength in various parts of the land. Indeed, there were several\r\ninsurrections, which required all the vigor of Cromwell to suppress.\r\nThe city of London, which held the purse-strings, was at heart\r\nPresbyterian, and was extremely dissatisfied with the course affairs\r\nwere taking. Then, again, there was a large, headstrong, levelling,\r\nmutineer party in the army, which clamored for violent courses, which\r\nat that time would have ruined every thing. Finally, the Scotch\r\nparliament had voted to raise a force of forty thousand men, to invade\r\nEngland and rescue the king. Cromwell, before he could settle the\r\npeace of the country, must overcome all these difficulties. Who, but\r\nhe, could have triumphed over so many obstacles, and such apparent\r\nanarchy?\r\n\r\nThe first thing Cromwell did was to restore order in England; and\r\ntherefore he obtained leave to march against the rebels, who had\r\narisen in various parts of the country. Scarcely were these subdued,\r\nbefore he heard of the advance of the Scottish army, under the Duke of\r\nHamilton. A second civil war now commenced, and all parties witnessed\r\nthe result with fearful anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe army of Hamilton was not as large as he had hoped. Still he had\r\nfifteen thousand men, and crossed the borders, while Cromwell was\r\nbesieging Pembroke, in a distant part of the kingdom. But Pembroke\r\nsoon surrendered; and Cromwell advanced, by rapid marches, against the\r\nScottish army, more than twice as large as his own. The hostile forces\r\nmet in Lancashire. Hamilton was successively defeated at Preston,\r\nWigan, and Warrington. Hamilton was taken prisoner at Uttoxeter,\r\nAugust 25, 1648, and his invading army was completely annihilated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cromwell Invades Scotland.]\r\n\r\nCromwell then resolved to invade, in his turn, Scotland itself, and,\r\nby a series of military actions, to give to the army a still greater\r\nascendency. He was welcomed at Edinburgh by the Duke of Argyle, the\r\nhead of an opposing faction, and was styled "the Preserver of\r\nScotland." That country was indeed rent with most unhappy divisions,\r\nwhich Lieutenant-General Cromwell remedied in the best way he could;\r\nand then he rapidly retraced his steps, to compose greater\r\ndifficulties at home. In his absence, the Presbyterians had rallied,\r\nand were again negotiating with the king on the Isle of Wight, while\r\nCromwell was openly denounced in the House of Lords as ambitious,\r\ntreacherous, and perfidious. Fairfax, his superior in command, but\r\ninferior in influence, was subduing the rebel royalists, who made a\r\nfirm resistance at Colchester, and all the various parties were\r\nsending their remonstrances to parliament.\r\n\r\nAmong these was a remarkable one from the regiments of Ireton,\r\nIngoldsby, Fleetwood, Whalley, and Overton, which imputed to\r\nparliament the neglect of the affairs of the realm, called upon it to\r\nproclaim the sovereignty of the people and the election of a supreme\r\nmagistrate, and threatened to take matters into their own hands. This\r\nwas in November, 1646; but, long before this, a republican government\r\nwas contemplated, although the leaders of the army had not joined in\r\nwith the hue and cry which the fanatical Levellers had made.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seizure of the King a Second Time.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the storm which the petition from the army had raised,\r\nthe news arrived that the king had been seized a second time, and had\r\nbeen carried a prisoner to Hurst Castle, on the coast opposite the\r\nisland, where he was closely confined by command of the army.\r\nParliament was justly indignant, and the debate relative to peace was\r\nresumed with redoubled earnestness. It is probable that, at this\r\ncrisis, so irritated was parliament against the army, peace would have\r\nbeen made with the king, and the Independent party suppressed, had not\r\nmost decisive measures been taken by the army. A rupture between the\r\nparliament and the army was inevitable. But Cromwell and the army\r\nchiefs had resolved upon their courses. The mighty stream of\r\nrevolution could no longer be checked. Twenty thousand men had vowed\r\nthat parliament should be purged. On the morning of December 6,\r\nColonel Pride and Colonel Rich, with troops, surrounded the House of\r\nCommons; and, as the members were going into the house, the most\r\nobnoxious were seized and sent to prison, among whom were Primrose,\r\nwho had lost his ears in his contest against the crown, Waller,\r\nHarley, Walker, and various other men, who had distinguished\r\nthemselves as advocates of constitutional liberty. None now remained\r\nin the House of Commons but some forty Independents, who were the\r\ntools of the army, and who voted to Cromwell their hearty thanks. "The\r\nminority had now become a majority,"--which is not unusual in\r\nrevolutionary times,--and proceeded to the work, in good earnest,\r\nwhich he had long contemplated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trial of the King.]\r\n\r\nThis was the trial of the king, whose apartments at Whitehall were now\r\noccupied by his victorious general, and whose treasures were now\r\nlavished on his triumphant soldiers.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of December, 1648, in the middle of the night, the\r\ndrawbridge of the Castle of Hurst was lowered, and a troop of horse\r\nentered the yard. Two days after, the king was removed to Windsor. On\r\nthe 23d, the Commons voted that he should be brought to trial. On the\r\n20th of January, Charles Stuart, King of England, was brought before\r\nthe Court of High Commission, in Westminster Hall, and placed at the\r\nbar, to be tried by this self-constituted body for his life. In the\r\nindictment, he was charged with being a tyrant, traitor, and murderer.\r\nTo such an indictment, and before such a body, the dignified but\r\nunfortunate successor of William the Conqueror demurred. He refused to\r\nacknowledge the jurisdiction of the court. But the solemn mockery of\r\nthe trial proceeded nevertheless, and on the 27th, sentence of death\r\nwas pronounced upon the prisoner--that prisoner the King of England, a\r\nfew years before the absolute ruler of the state. On January 30, the\r\nbloody sentence was executed, and the soul of the murdered king\r\nascended to that God who pardons those who put their trust in him, in\r\nspite of all their mistakes, errors, and delusions. The career of\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0I. is the most melancholy in English history. That he was\r\ntyrannical, that he disregarded the laws by which he swore to rule,\r\nthat he was narrow, and bigoted, that he was deceitful in his\r\npromises, that he was bent on overturning the liberties of England,\r\nand did not comprehend the wants and circumstances of his times, can\r\nscarcely be questioned. But that he was sincere in his religion,\r\nupright in his private life, of respectable talents, and good\r\nintentions, must also be admitted. His execution, or rather his\r\nmartyrdom, made a deep and melancholy impression in all Christian\r\ncountries, and was the great blunder which the republicans made--a\r\nblunder which Hampden would have avoided. His death, however, removed\r\nfrom England a most dangerous intriguer, and, for a while, cemented\r\nthe power of Cromwell and his party, who now had undisputed ascendency\r\nin the government of the realm. Charles\'s exactions and tyranny\r\nprovoked the resistance of parliament, and the indignation of the\r\npeople, then intensely excited in discussing the abstract principles\r\nof civil and religious liberty. The resistance of parliament created\r\nthe necessity of an army, and the indignation of the people filled it\r\nwith enthusiasts. The army flushed with success, forgot its relations\r\nand duties, and usurped the government it had destroyed, and a\r\nmilitary dictatorship, the almost inevitable result of revolution,\r\nthough under the name of a republic, succeeded to the despotism of the\r\nStuart kings. This republic, therefore, next claims attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--The standard Histories of England.

On the 6th of February, the House of Peers was decreed\r\nuseless and dangerous, and was also dispensed with. On the next day,\r\nroyalty was formally abolished. The supreme executive power was vested\r\nin a council of state of forty members, the president of which was\r\nBradshaw, the relative and friend of Milton, who employed his immortal\r\ngenius in advocating the new government. The army remained under the\r\ncommand of Fairfax and Cromwell; the navy was controlled by a board of\r\nadmiralty, headed by Sir Harry Vane. A greater toleration of religion\r\nwas proclaimed than had ever been known before, much to the annoyance\r\nof the Presbyterians, who were additionally vexed that the state was\r\nseparated entirely from the church.\r\n\r\nThe Independents pursued their victory with considerable moderation,\r\nand only the Duke of Hamilton, and Lords Holland and Capel, were\r\nexecuted for treason, while a few others were shut up in the Tower.\r\nNever was so mighty a revolution accomplished with so little\r\nbloodshed. But it required all the wisdom and vigor of Fairfax and\r\nCromwell to repress the ultra radical spirit which had crept into\r\nseveral detachments of the army, and to baffle the movements which the\r\nScots were making in favor of Charles Stuart, who had already been\r\nproclaimed king by the parliament of Scotland, and in Ireland by the\r\nMarquis of Ormond.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Storming of Drogheda and Wexford.]\r\n\r\nThe insurrection in Ireland first required the notice of the new\r\nEnglish government. Cromwell accepted the conduct of the war, and the\r\noffice of lord lieutenant. Dublin and Derry were the only places which\r\nheld out for the parliament. All other parts of the country were in a\r\nstate of insurrection. On the 15th of August, Cromwell and his\r\nson-in-law, Ireton, landed near Dublin with an army of six thousand\r\nfoot and three thousand horse only; but it was an army of Ironsides\r\nand Titans. In six months, the complete reconquest of the country was\r\neffected. The policy of the conqueror was severe and questionable; but\r\nit was successful. In the hope of bringing the war to a speedy\r\ntermination, Cromwell proceeded in such a way as to bring terror to\r\nhis name, and curses on his memory. Drogheda and Wexford were not only\r\ntaken by storm, but nearly the whole garrison, of more than five\r\nthousand men, were barbarously put to the sword. The Irish quailed\r\nbefore such a victor, and town after town hastened to make peace.\r\nCromwell\'s excuse for his undeniable cruelties was, the necessity of\r\nthe case, of which we may reasonably suppose him to be a judge.\r\nScotland was in array, and English affairs, scarcely settled, demanded\r\nhis presence in London. An imperfect conquest, on the principles of\r\nRousseau\'s philanthropy, did not suit the taste or the notions of\r\nCromwell. If he had consumed a few more months than he actually\r\nemployed, either in treaty-making with a deceitful though oppressed\r\npeople, or in battles on the principles of the military science then\r\nin vogue, the cause of Independency would have been lost; and that\r\ncause, associated with that of liberty, in the eyes of Cromwell, was\r\nof more value than the whole Irish nation, or any other nation.\r\nCromwell was a devotee to a cause. Principles, with him, were every\r\nthing; men were nothing in comparison. To advance the principles for\r\nwhich he fought, he scrupled to use no means or instruments. In this\r\nhe may have erred. But this policy was the secret of his success. We\r\ncannot justify his cruelties in war, because it is hard to justify the\r\nwar itself. But if we acknowledge its necessity, we should remember\r\nthat such a master of war as was Cromwell knew his circumstances\r\nbetter than we do or can know. To his immortal glory it can be said\r\nthat he never inflicted cruelty when he deemed it unnecessary; that he\r\nnever fought for the love of fighting; and that he stopped fighting\r\nwhen the cause for which he fought was won. And this is more than can\r\nbe said of most conquerors, even of those imbued with sentimental\r\nhorror of bloodshed. Our world is full of cant. Cromwell\'s language\r\nsometimes sounds like it, especially when he speaks of the "hand of\r\nthe Lord" in "these mighty changes," who "breaketh the enemies of his\r\nchurch in pieces."\r\n\r\nWhen the conquest of Ireland was completed, Cromwell hastened to\r\nLondon to receive the thanks of parliament and the acclamations of the\r\npeople; and then he hurried to Scotland to do battle with the Scots,\r\nwho had made a treaty with the king, and were resolved to establish\r\nPresbyterianism and royalty. Cromwell now superseded Fairfax, and was\r\ncreated captain-general of the forces of the commonwealth. Cromwell\r\npassed the borders, reached Edinburgh without molestation, and then\r\nadvanced on the Scotch army of twenty-seven thousand men, under\r\nLesley, at Dunbar, where was fought a most desperate battle, but which\r\nCromwell gained with marvellous intrepidity and skill. Three thousand\r\nmen were killed, and ten thousand taken prisoners, and the hopes of\r\nthe Scots blasted. The lord-general made a halt, and the whole army\r\nsang the one hundred and seventeenth psalm, and then advanced upon the\r\ncapital, which opened its gates. Glasgow followed the example; the\r\nwhole south of Scotland submitted; while the king fled towards the\r\nHighlands, but soon rallied, and even took the bold resolution of\r\nmarching into England, while Cromwell was besieging Perth. Charles\r\nreached Worcester before he was overtaken, established himself with\r\nsixteen thousand men, but was attacked by Cromwell, was defeated, and\r\nwith difficulty fled. He reached France, however, and quietly rested\r\nuntil he was brought back by General Monk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Worcester.]\r\n\r\nWith the battle of Worcester, September 3, 1651, which Cromwell called\r\nhis "crowning mercy," ended his military life. From that day to the\r\ntime when be became protector, the most noticeable point in his\r\nhistory is his conduct towards the parliament. And this conduct is the\r\nmost objectionable part of his life and character; for in this he\r\nviolated the very principles he originally professed, and committed\r\nthe same usurpations which he condemned in Charles\xc2\xa0I. Here he was not\r\ntrue to himself or his cause. Here he laid himself open to the censure\r\nof all posterity; and although he had great excuses, and his course\r\nhas many palliations, still it would seem a mockery of all moral\r\ndistinctions not to condemn in him what we would condemn in another,\r\nor what Cromwell himself condemned in the murdered king. It is true he\r\ndid not, at once, turn usurper, not until circumstances seemed to\r\nwarrant the usurpation--the utter impossibility of governing England,\r\nexcept by exercising the rights and privileges of an absolute monarch.\r\nOn the principles of expediency, he has been vindicated, and will be\r\nvindicated, so long as his cause is advocated by partisan historians,\r\nor expediency itself is advocated as a rule of life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Policy of Cromwell.]\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Worcester, Cromwell lost, in a measure, his\r\ndemocratic sympathies, and naturally, in view of the great excesses of\r\nthe party with which he had been identified. That he desired the\r\npublic good we cannot reasonably doubt; and he adapted himself to\r\nthose circumstances which seemed to advance it, and which a spirit of\r\nwild democratic license assuredly did not. So far as it contributed to\r\noverturn the throne of the Stuarts, and the whole system of public\r\nabuses, civil and ecclesiastical, Cromwell favored it. But no further.\r\nWhen it seemed subversive of law and order, the grand ends of all\r\ncivil governments, then he opposed it. And in this he showed that he\r\nwas much more conservative in his spirit than has often been supposed;\r\nand, in this conservatism he resembled Luther and other great\r\nreformers, who were not unreflecting incendiaries, as is sometimes\r\nthought--men who destroy, but do not reconstruct. Luther, at heart,\r\nwas a conservative, and never sought a change to which he was not led\r\nby strong inward tempests--forced to make it by the voice of his\r\nconscience, which he ever obeyed, and loyalty to which so remarkably\r\ncharacterized the early reformers, and no class of men more than the\r\nPuritans. Cromwell abhorred the government of Charles, because it was\r\nnot a government which respected justice, and which set at defiance\r\nthe higher laws of God. It was not because Charles violated the\r\nconstitution, it was because he violated truth and equity, and the\r\nnation\'s good, that he opposed him. Cromwell usurped his prerogatives,\r\nand violated the English constitution; but he did not transgress those\r\ngreat primal principles of truth, for which constitutions are made. He\r\nlooked beyond constitutions to abstract laws of justice; and it never\r\ncan be laid to his charge that he slighted these, or proved a weak or\r\nwicked ruler. He quarrelled with parliament, because the parliament\r\nwished to perpetuate its existence unlawfully and meanly, and was\r\nmoreover unwilling and unable to cope with many difficulties which\r\nconstantly arose. It may be supposed that Cromwell may thus have\r\nthought: "I will not support the parliament, for it will not maintain\r\nlaw; it will not legislate wisely or beneficently; it seeks its own,\r\nnot the nation\'s good. And therefore I take away its existence, and\r\nrule myself; for I have the fear of God before my eyes, and am\r\ndetermined to rule by his laws, and to advance his glory." Deluded he\r\nwas; blinded by ambition he may have been but he sought to elevate his\r\ncountry; and his efforts in her behalf are appreciated and praised by\r\nthe very men who are most severe on his undoubted usurpation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rump Parliament.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dispersion of the Parliament.]\r\n\r\nShortly after the Long Parliament was purged, at the instigation of\r\nCromwell, and had become the Rump Parliament, as it was derisively\r\ncalled, it appointed a committee to take into consideration the time\r\nwhen their powers should cease. But the battle of Worcester was fought\r\nbefore any thing was done, except to determine that future parliaments\r\nshould consist of four hundred members, and that the existing members\r\nshould be returned, in the next parliament, for the places they then\r\nrepresented. At length, in December, 1651, it was decided, through the\r\nurgent entreaties of Cromwell, but only by a small majority, that the\r\npresent parliament should cease in November, 1654. Thus it was obvious\r\nto Cromwell that the parliament, reduced as it was, and composed of\r\nIndependents, was jealous of him, and also was aiming to perpetuate\r\nits own existence, against all the principles of a representative\r\ngovernment. Such are men, so greedy of power themselves, so censorious\r\nin regard to the violation of justice by others, so blind to the\r\nviolation of justice by themselves. Cromwell was not the man to permit\r\nthe usurpation of power by a body of forty or sixty Independents,\r\nhowever willing he was to assume it himself. Beside, the Rump\r\nParliament was inefficient, and did not consult the interests of the\r\ncountry. There was general complaint. But none complained more\r\nbitterly than Cromwell himself. Meeting Whitelock, who then held the\r\ngreat seal, he said that the "army was beginning to have a strange\r\ndistaste against them; that their pride, and ambition, and\r\nself-seeking; their engrossing all places of honor and profit to\r\nthemselves and their friends; their daily breaking into new and\r\nviolent parties; their delays of business, and design to perpetuate\r\nthemselves, and continue the power in their own hands; their meddling\r\nin private matters between party and party, their injustice and\r\npartiality; the scandalous lives of some of them, do give too much\r\nground for people to open their mouths against them; and unless there\r\nbe some power to check them, it will be impossible to prevent our\r\nruin." These things Whitelock admitted, but did not see how they could\r\nbe removed since both he and Cromwell held their commissions from this\r\nsame parliament, which was the supreme authority. But Cromwell thought\r\nthere was nothing to hope, and every thing to fear, from such a body\r\nof men; that they would destroy what the Lord had done. "We all forget\r\nGod," said he, "and God will forget us. He will give us up to\r\nconfusion, and these men will help it on, if left to themselves." Then\r\nhe asked the great lawyer and chancellor, "What if a man should take\r\nupon himself to be king?"--evidently having in view the regal power.\r\nBut Whitelock presented such powerful reasons against it, that\r\nCromwell gave up the idea, though he was resolved to destroy the\r\nparliament. He then held repeated conferences with the officers of the\r\narmy, who sympathized with him, and who supported him. At last, while\r\nparliament was about to pass an obnoxious bill, Cromwell hurried to\r\nthe House, taking with him a file of musketeers, having resolved what\r\nhe would do. These he left in the lobby, and, taking his seat,\r\nlistened a while to the discussion, and then rose, and addressed the\r\nHouse. Waxing warm, he told them, in violent language, "that they were\r\ndeniers of justice, were oppressive, profane men, were planning to\r\nbring in Presbyterians, and would lose no time in destroying the cause\r\nthey had deserted." Sir Harry Vane and Sir Peter Wentworth rose to\r\nremonstrate, but Cromwell, leaving his seat, walked up and down the\r\nfloor, with his hat on, reproached the different members, who again\r\nremonstrated. But Cromwell, raising his voice, exclaimed, "You are no\r\nparliament. Get you gone. Give way to honester men." Then, stamping\r\nwith his feet, the door opened, and the musketeers entered, and the\r\nmembers were dispersed, after giving vent to their feelings in the\r\nlanguage of reproach. Most of them wore swords, but none offered\r\nresistance to the man they feared, and tamely departed.\r\n\r\nThus was the constitution utterly subverted, and parliament, as well\r\nas the throne, destroyed. Cromwell published, the next day, a\r\nvindication of his conduct, setting forth the incapacity, selfishness\r\nand corruption of the parliament, in which were some of the best men\r\nEngland ever had, including Sir Harry Vane, Algernon Sydney, and Sir\r\nPeter Wentworth.\r\n\r\nHis next step was to order the continuance of all the courts of\r\njustice, as before, and summon a new parliament, the members of which\r\nwere nominated by himself and his council of officers. The army, with\r\nCromwell at the head, was now the supreme authority.\r\n\r\nThe new parliament, composed of one hundred and twenty persons,\r\nassembled on the 4th of July, when Cromwell explained the reason of\r\nhis conduct, and set forth the mercies of the Lord to England. This\r\nparliament was not constitutional, since it was not elected by the\r\npeople of England, but by Cromwell, and therefore would be likely to\r\nbe his tool. But had the elections been left free, the Presbyterians\r\nwould have been returned as the largest party, and they would have\r\nruined the cause which Cromwell and the Independents sought to\r\nsupport. In revolutions, there cannot be pursued half measures.\r\nRevolutions are the contest between parties. The strongest party gains\r\nthe ascendency, and keeps it if it can--never by old, constituted\r\nlaws. In the English Revolution the Independents gained this\r\nascendency by their valor, enthusiasm, and wisdom. And their great\r\nrepresentative ruled in their name.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cromwell Assumes the Protectorship.]\r\n\r\nThe new members of parliament reappointed the old Council of State, at\r\nthe head of which was Cromwell, abolished the High Court of Chancery,\r\nnominated commissioners to preside in courts of justice, and proceeded\r\nto other sweeping changes, which alarmed their great nominator, who\r\ninduced them to dissolve themselves and surrender their trust into his\r\nhands, under the title of Lord Protector of England, Scotland, and\r\nIreland. On the 16th of December, he was installed in his great\r\noffice, with considerable pomp, in the Court of Chancery, and the new\r\nconstitution was read, which invested him with all the powers of a\r\nking. It, however, ordained that he should rule with the aid of a\r\nparliament, which should have all the functions and powers of the old\r\nparliaments, should be assembled within five months, should last three\r\nyears, and should consist of four hundred and sixty members. It\r\nprovided for the maintenance of the army and navy, of which the\r\nprotector was the head, and decided that the great officers of state\r\nshould be chosen by approbation of parliament. Religious toleration\r\nwas proclaimed, and provision made for the support of the clergy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Dutch War.]\r\n\r\nThus was the constitution of the nation changed, and a republic\r\nsubstituted for a monarchy, at the head of which was the ablest man of\r\nhis age. And there was need of all his abilities. England then was\r\nengaged in war with the Dutch, and the internal state of the nation\r\ndemanded the attention of a vigorous mind and a still more vigorous\r\narm.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch war was prosecuted with great vigor, and was signalized by\r\nthe naval victories of Blake, Dean, and Monk over the celebrated Van\r\nTromp and De Ruyter, the Dutch admirals. The war was caused by the\r\ncommercial jealousies of the two nations, and by the unwillingness of\r\nthe Prince of Orange, who had married a daughter of Charles\xc2\xa0I., to\r\nacknowledge the ambassador of the new English republic. But the\r\nsuperiority which the English sailors evinced, soon taught the Dutch\r\nhow dangerous it was to provoke a nation which should be its ally on\r\nall grounds of national policy, and peace was therefore honorably\r\nsecured after a most successful war.\r\n\r\nThe war being ended, the protector had more leisure to attend to\r\nbusiness at home. Sir Matthew Hale was made chief justice, and\r\nThurloe, secretary of state; disorganizers were punished; an\r\ninsurrection in Scotland was quelled by General Monk; and order and\r\nlaw were restored.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the new parliament, the first which had been freely elected\r\nfor fourteen years, soon manifested a spirit of opposition to\r\nCromwell, deferred to vote him supplies, and annoyed him all in its\r\npower. Still he permitted the members to discuss trifling subjects and\r\nwaste their time for five months; but, at the earliest time the new\r\nconstitution would allow, he summoned them to the Painted Chamber,\r\nmade them a long speech, reminded them of their neglect in attending\r\nto the interests of the nation, while disputing about abstract\r\nquestions, even while it was beset with dangers and difficulties, and\r\nthen dissolved them, (January 22, 1656.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cromwell Rules without a Parliament.]\r\n\r\nFor the next eighteen months, he ruled without a parliament and found\r\nno difficulty in raising supplies, and supporting his now unlimited\r\npower. During this time, he suppressed a dangerous insurrection in\r\nEngland itself, and carried on a successful and brilliant war against\r\nSpain, a power which he hated with all the capacity of hatred of which\r\nhis nation has shown itself occasionally so capable. In the naval war\r\nwith Spain, Blake was again the hero. During the contest the rich\r\nisland of Jamaica was conquered from the Spanish, a possession which\r\nEngland has ever since greatly valued.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by his successes, Cromwell now called a third parliament,\r\nwhich he opened the 17th of September, 1656, after ejecting one\r\nhundred of the members, on account of their political sentiments. The\r\nnew House voted for the prosecution of the Spanish war, granted ample\r\nsupplies, and offered to Cromwell the title of king. But his council\r\nviolently opposed it, and Cromwell found it expedient to relinquish\r\nthis object of his heart. But his protectorate was continued to him,\r\nand he was empowered to nominate his successor.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, however, the spirit of the new parliament was\r\nmanifested, not only by violent opposition to the protector, but in\r\nacts which would, if carried out, have subverted the government again,\r\nand have plunged England in anarchy. It was plain that the protector\r\ncould not rule with a real representation of the nation. So he\r\ndissolved it; and thus ended the last effort of Cromwell to rule with\r\na parliament; or, as his advocates say, to restore the constitution of\r\nhis country. It was plain that there was too much party animosity and\r\nparty ambition to permit the protector, shackled by the law, to carry\r\nout his designs of order and good government. Self-preservation\r\ncompelled him to be suspicious and despotic, and also to prohibit the\r\nexercise of the Catholic worship, and to curtail the religious rights\r\nof the Quakers, Socinians, and Jews. The continual plottings and\r\npolitical disaffections of these parties forced him to rule on a\r\nsystem to which he was not at first inclined. England was not yet\r\nprepared for the civil and religious liberty at which the advocates of\r\nrevolution had at first aimed.\r\n\r\nSo Cromwell now resolved to rule alone. And he ruled well. His armies\r\nwere victorious on the continent, and England was respected abroad,\r\nand prospered at home. The most able and upright men were appointed to\r\noffice. The chairs of the universities were filled with illustrious\r\nscholars, and the bench adorned with learned and honest judges. He\r\ndefended the great interests of Protestantism on the Continent, and\r\nformed alliances which contributed to the political and commercial\r\ngreatness of his country. He generously assisted the persecuted\r\nProtestants in the valleys of Piedmont, and refused to make treaties\r\nwith hostile powers unless the religious liberties of the Protestants\r\nwere respected. He lived at Hampton Court, the old palace of Cardinal\r\nWolsey, in simple and sober dignity; nor was debauchery or riot seen\r\nat his court. He lived simply and unostentatiously, and to the last\r\npreserved the form, and perhaps the spirit, of his early piety. He\r\nsurrounded himself with learned men, and patronized poets and\r\nscholars. Milton was his familiar guest, and the youthful Dryden was\r\nnot excluded from his table. An outward morality, at least, was\r\ngenerally observed, and the strictest discipline was kept at his\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nHad Cromwell\'s life been prolonged to threescore and ten, the history\r\nof England might have been different for the next two hundred years.\r\nBut such was not his fortune. Providence removed him from the scene of\r\nhis conflicts and his heroism not long after the dissolution of his\r\nlast parliament. The death of a favorite daughter preyed upon his\r\nmind, and the cares of government undermined his constitution. He died\r\non the 3d of September, 1658, the anniversary of his great battles of\r\nWorcester and Dunbar, in the sixtieth year of his age.\r\n\r\nTwo or three nights before he died, he was heard to ejaculate the\r\nfollowing prayer, in the anticipation of his speedy departure; "Lord,\r\nthough I am a miserable and wretched creature, I am in covenant with\r\nthee, through thy grace; and I may, I will come to thee, for thy\r\npeople. Thou hast made me, though very unworthy, a mean instrument to\r\ndo them good, and Thee service; and many of them have set too high\r\nvalue upon me, though others wish and would be glad of my death. Lord,\r\nhowever Thou disposest of me, continue and go on to do good to them.\r\nGive them consistency of judgment, one heart, and mutual love; and,\r\nwith the work of reformation, go on to deliver them, and make the name\r\nof Christ glorious in the world. Teach those who look too much on thy\r\ninstrument to depend more upon Thyself. Pardon such as desire to\r\ntrample upon the dust of a poor worm, for they are Thy people too. And\r\npardon the folly of this short prayer, even for Jesus Christ\'s sake.\r\nAnd give me a good night, if it be Thy pleasure. Amen."\r\n\r\nThus closed the career of Oliver Cromwell, the most remarkable man in\r\nthe list of England\'s heroes. His motives and his honesty have often\r\nbeen impeached, and sometimes by the most excellent and\r\ndiscriminating, but oftener by heated partisans, who had no sympathy\r\nwith his reforms or opinions. His genius, however, has never been\r\nquestioned, nor his extraordinary talent, for governing a nation in\r\nthe most eventful period of its history. And there is a large class,\r\nand that class an increasing one, not confined to Independents or\r\nrepublicans, who look upon him as one habitually governed by a stern\r\nsense of duty, as a man who feared God and regarded justice, as a man\r\nsincerely devoted to the best interests of his country, and deserving\r\nof the highest praises of all enlightened critics. No man has ever\r\nbeen more extravagantly eulogized, or been the subject of more\r\nunsparing abuse and more cordial detestation. Some are incapable of\r\nviewing him in any other light than as a profound hypocrite and\r\nambitious despot, while others see in him nothing but the saint and\r\nunspotted ruler. He had his defects; for human nature, in all\r\ninstances, is weak; but in spite of these, and of many and great\r\ninconsistencies, from which no sophistry can clear him, his great and\r\nvaried excellences will ever entitle him to the rank accorded to him\r\nby such writers as Vaughan and Carlyle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regal Government Restored.]\r\n\r\nWith the death of Cromwell virtually ended the republic. "Puritanism\r\nwithout its king, is kingless, anarchic, falls into dislocation,\r\nstaggers, and plunges into even deeper anarchy." His son Richard,\r\naccording to his will, was proclaimed protector in his stead. But his\r\nreign was short. Petitions poured in from every quarter for the\r\nrestoration of parliament. It was restored, and also with it royalty\r\nitself. General Monk advanced with his army from Scotland, and\r\nquartered in London. In May, 1660, Charles\xc2\xa0II. was proclaimed king at\r\nthe gates of Westminster Hall. The experiment of a republic had been\r\ntried, and failed. Puritanism veiled its face. It was no longer the\r\nspirit of the nation. A great reaction commenced. Royalty, with new\r\nbut disguised despotism, resumed its sway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Carlyle\'s, Dr. Vaughan\'s, and D\'Aubign\xc3\xa9\'s Life\r\n     of Cromwell.

On the 25th of\r\nMay, 1660, he landed near Dover, with his two brothers, the Dukes of\r\nYork and Gloucester. On the 29th of May, he made his triumphal entry\r\ninto London. It was his birthday, he was thirty years of age, and in\r\nthe full maturity of manly beauty, while his gracious manners and\r\ncaptivating speech made him the favorite of the people, as well as of\r\nthe old nobility. The season was full of charms, and the spirits of\r\nall classes were buoyant with hope. Every thing conspired to give a\r\nglow to the popular enthusiasm. A long line of illustrious monarchs\r\nwas restored. The hateful fires of religious fanaticism were\r\napparently extinguished. An accomplished sovereign, disciplined in the\r\nschool of adversity, of brilliant talents, amiable temper, fascinating\r\nmanners, and singular experiences, had returned to the throne of his\r\nancestors, and had sworn to rule by the laws, to forget old offences,\r\nand promote liberty of conscience. No longer should there be a\r\ngovernment of soldiers, nor the rule of a man hostile to those\r\npleasures and opinions which had ever been dear to the English people.\r\nWith the return of the exiled prince, should also return joy, peace,\r\nand prosperity. For seventeen years, there had been violent political\r\nand social animosities, war, tyranny, social restraints, and religious\r\nfanaticism. But order and law were now to be re\xc3\xabstablished, and the\r\nreign of cant and hypocrisy was now to end. Justice and mercy were to\r\nmeet together in the person of a king who was represented to have all\r\nthe virtues and none of the vices of his station and his times. So\r\npeople reasoned and felt, of all classes and conditions. And why\r\nshould they not rejoice in the restoration of such blessings? The ways\r\nwere strewn with flowers, the bells sent forth a merry peal, the\r\nstreets were hung with tapestries; while aldermen with their heavy\r\nchains, nobles in their robes of pomp, ladies with their silks and\r\nsatins, and waving handkerchiefs, filling all the balconies and\r\nwindows; musicians, dancers, and exulting crowds,--all welcomed the\r\nreturn of Charles. Never was there so great a jubilee in London; and\r\nnever did monarch receive such addresses of flattery and loyalty.\r\n"Dread monarch," said the Earl of Manchester, in the House of Lords,\r\n"I offer no flattering titles. You are the desire of three kingdoms,\r\nthe strength and stay of the tribes of the people." "Most royal\r\nsovereign," said one of the deputations, "the hearts of all are filled\r\nwith veneration for you, confidence in you, longings for you. All\r\ndegrees, and ages, and sexes, high, low, rich and poor, men, women,\r\nand children, join in sending up to Heaven one prayer, \'Long live King\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0II.;\' so that the English air is not susceptible of any other\r\nsound, bells, bonfires, peals of ordnance, shouts, and acclamations of\r\nthe people bear no other moral; nor can his majesty conceive with what\r\njoy, what cheerfulness, what lettings out of the soul, what\r\nexpressions of transported minds, a stupendous concourse of people\r\nattended the proclamation of their most potent, most mighty, and most\r\nundoubted king." Such was the adulatory language addressed by the\r\nEnglish people to the son of the king they had murdered, and to a man\r\nnoted for every frivolity and vice that could degrade a sovereign.\r\nWhat are we to think of that public joy, and public sycophancy, after\r\nso many years of hard fighting for civil and religious liberty? For\r\nwhat were the battles of Naseby and Worcester? For what the Solemn\r\nLeague and Covenant? For what the trial and execution of Charles\xc2\xa0I.?\r\nFor what the elevation of Cromwell? Alas! for what were all the\r\nexperiments and sufferings of twenty years, the breaking up of old and\r\nmighty customs, and twenty years of blood, usurpation, and change?\r\nWhat were the benefits of the Revolution? Or, had it no benefits? How\r\nhappened it that a whole nation should simultaneously rise and expel\r\ntheir monarch from a throne which his ancestors had enjoyed for six\r\nhundred years, and then, in so short a time, have elevated to this old\r\nthrone, which was supposed to be subverted forever, the son of their\r\ninsulted, humiliated, and murdered king? and this without bloodshed,\r\nwith every demonstration of national rejoicings, and with every\r\nexternal mark of repentance for their past conduct. Charles, too, was\r\nrestored without any of those limitations by which the nation sought\r\nto curtail the power of his father. The nation surrendered to him more\r\nabsolute power than the most ambitious kings, since the reign of John,\r\nhad ever claimed,--more than he ever dared to expect. How shall we\r\nexplain these things? And what is the moral which they teach?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reaction to Revolutionary Principles.]\r\n\r\nOne fact is obvious,--that a great reaction had taken place in the\r\nnational mind as to revolutionary principles. It is evident that a\r\ngreat disgust for the government of Cromwell had succeeded the\r\nantipathy to the royal government of Charles. All classes as ardently\r\ndesired the restoration, as they had before favored the rebellion.\r\nEven the old parliamentarians hailed the return of Charles,\r\nnotwithstanding it was admitted that the protectorate was a vigorous\r\nadministration; that law and order were enforced; that religious\r\nliberty was proclaimed; that the rights of conscience were respected;\r\nthat literature and science were encouraged; that the morals of the\r\npeople were purified; that the ordinances of religion were observed;\r\nthat vice and folly were discouraged; that justice was ably\r\nadministered; that peace and plenty were enjoyed; that prosperity\r\nattended the English arms abroad; and that the nation was as much\r\nrespected abroad as it was prosperous at home. These things were\r\nadmitted by the very people who rejoiced in the restoration. And yet,\r\nin spite of all these substantial blessings, the reign of Cromwell was\r\nodious. Why was this?\r\n\r\nIt can only be explained on the supposition that there were\r\n_unendurable evils_ connected with the administration of Cromwell,\r\nwhich more than balanced the benefits he conferred; or, that\r\nexpectations were held out by Charles of national benefits greater\r\nthan those conferred by the republic; or, that the nation had so\r\nretrograded in elevation of sentiment as to be unable to appreciate\r\nthe excellences of Cromwell\'s administration.\r\n\r\nThere is much to support all of these suppositions. In regard to the\r\nevils connected with the republic, it is certain that a large standing\r\narmy was supported, and was necessary to uphold the government of the\r\nprotector, in order to give to it efficiency and character. This army\r\nwas expensive, and the people felt the burden. They always complain\r\nunder taxation, whether necessary or not. Taxes ever make any\r\ngovernment unpopular, and made the administration of Cromwell\r\nespecially so. And the army showed the existence of a military\r\ndespotism, which, however imperatively called for, or rendered\r\nunavoidable by revolution, was still a hateful fact. The English never\r\nhave liked the principle of a military despotism. And it was a bitter\r\nreflection to feel that so much blood and treasure had been expended\r\nto get rid of the arbitrary rule of the Stuarts, only to introduce a\r\nstill more expensive and arbitrary government, under the name of a\r\nrepublic. Moreover, the eyes of the people were opened to the moral\r\ncorruptions incident to the support of a large army, without which the\r\npower of Cromwell would have been unsubstantial. He may originally\r\nhave desired to establish his power on a civil basis, rather than a\r\nmilitary one; but his desires were not realized. The parliaments which\r\nhe assembled were unpractical and disorderly. He was forced to rule\r\nwithout them. But the nation could not forget this great insult to\r\ntheir liberties, and to those privileges which had ever been dear to\r\nthem. The preponderance of the civil power has, for several centuries,\r\ncharacterized the government; and no blessings were sufficiently great\r\nto balance the evil, in the eye of an Englishman, of the preponderance\r\nof a military government, neither the excellence of Cromwell\'s life,\r\nnor the glory and greatness to which he raised the nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excellences in Charles\'s Government.]\r\n\r\nAgain, much was expected of Charles\xc2\xa0II., and there was much in his\r\ncharacter and early administration to produce content. His manners\r\nwere agreeable. He had no personal antipathies or jealousies. He\r\nselected, at first, the wisest and best of all parties to be his\r\ncounsellors and ministers. He seemed to forget old offences. He was\r\nfond of pleasure; was good-natured and affable. He summoned a free\r\nparliament. His interests were made to appear identical with those of\r\nthe people. He promised to rule by the laws. He did not openly\r\ninfringe on the constitution. And he restored, what has ever been so\r\ndear to the great body of the nation, the Episcopal Church in all its\r\nbeauty and grandeur, while he did not recommence the persecution of\r\nPuritans until some time had elapsed from his restoration. Above all,\r\nhe disbanded the army, which was always distasteful to the\r\npeople,--odious, onerous, and oppressive. The civil power again\r\ntriumphed over that of the military, and circumstances existed which\r\nrendered the subversion of liberty very difficult. Many adverse events\r\ntranspired during his unfortunate and disgraceful reign; but these, in\r\nthe early part of it, had not, of course, been anticipated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Failure of the Puritan Experiment.]\r\n\r\nThere is also force in the third supposition, that the nation had\r\nretrograded in moral elevation. All writers speak of a strong reaction\r\nto the religious fervor of the early revolutionists. The moral\r\ninfluence of the army had proved destructive to the habits and\r\nsentiments of the people. A strong love of pleasure and demoralizing\r\namusements existed, when Charles was recalled. A general laxity of\r\nmorals was lamented by the wisest and best of the nation. The\r\nreligious convictions of enthusiasts survived their sympathies.\r\nHypocrisy and cant succeeded fervor and honesty. Infidelity lurked in\r\nmany a bosom in which devotional ardor had once warmly burned.\r\nDistrust of all philanthropy and all human virtue was as marked, as\r\nfaith in the same previously had been. The ordinances of religion\r\nbecame irksome, and it was remembered with bitterness that the\r\nPuritans, in the days of their ascendency, had cruelly proscribed the\r\nmost favorite pleasures and time-honored festivals of old England. But\r\nthe love of them returned with redoubled vigor. May-poles,\r\nwrestling-matches, bear-baitings, puppet-shows, bowls, horse-racing,\r\nbetting, rope-dancing, romping under the mistletoe on Christmas,\r\neating boars\' heads, attending the theatres, health-drinking,--all\r\nthese old-fashioned ways, in which the English sought merriment, were\r\nrestored. The evil was chiefly in the excess to which these pleasures\r\nwere carried; and every thing, which bore any resemblance to the\r\nPuritans, was ridiculed and despised. The nation, as a nation, did not\r\nlove Puritanism, or any thing pertaining to it, after the deep\r\nreligious excitement had passed away. The people were ashamed of\r\nprayer-meetings, of speaking through their noses, of wearing their\r\nhair straight, of having their garments cut primly, of calling their\r\nchildren by the name of Moses, Joshua, Jeremiah, Obadiah, &c.; and, in\r\nshort, of all customs and opinions peculiar to the Extreme Puritans.\r\nSo general was the disgust of Puritanism, so eager were all to indulge\r\nin the pleasures that had been forbidden under the reign of Cromwell,\r\nso sick were they of the very name of republicanism, that Puritanism\r\nmay be said to have proved, in England, a signal failure.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the reasons of popular acclamation on the\r\nrestoration of Charles\xc2\xa0II., and which we cannot consider entirely\r\nwithout force. A state of mind existed in England as favorable to the\r\nencroachments of royalty, as, twenty years before, it had been\r\nunfavorable.\r\n\r\nCharles was not a high-minded, or honest, or patriotic king; and\r\ntherefore we might naturally expect the growth of absolutism during\r\nhis reign. The progress of absolutism is, indeed, one of its features.\r\nThis, for a time, demands our notice.\r\n\r\nOn the restoration of Charles\xc2\xa0II., his subjects made no particular\r\nstipulations respecting their liberties, which were incautiously\r\nintrusted to his hands. But, at first, he did not seem inclined to\r\ngrasp at greater powers than what the constitution allowed him. He had\r\nthe right to appoint the great officers of state, the privilege of\r\nveto on legislative enactments, the control of the army and navy, the\r\nregulation of all foreign intercourse, and the right of making peace\r\nand war. But the constitution did not allow him to rule without a\r\nparliament, or to raise taxes without its consent. The parliament\r\nmight grant or withhold supplies at pleasure, and all money bills\r\noriginated and were discussed in the House of Commons alone. These\r\nwere the great principles of the English constitution, which Charles\r\nswore to maintain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Repeal of the Triennial Bill.]\r\n\r\nThe first form in which the encroaching temper of the king was\r\nmanifested was, in causing the Triennial Bill to be repealed. This was\r\nindeed done by the parliament, but through the royal influence. This\r\nbill was not that a parliament should be assembled every three years,\r\nbut that the interval between one session and another should not\r\nexceed that period. But this wise law, which had passed by acclamation\r\nduring the reign of Charles\xc2\xa0I., and for which even Clarendon had\r\nvoted, was regarded by Charles\xc2\xa0II. as subversive of the liberty of his\r\ncrown; and a supple, degenerate and sycophantic parliament gratified\r\nhis wishes.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time was passed the Corporation Act, which enjoined all\r\nmagistrates, and persons of trust in corporations, to swear that they\r\nbelieved it unlawful, under any pretence whatever to take arms against\r\nthe king. The Presbyterians refused to take this oath; and they were\r\ntherefore excluded from offices of dignity and trust. The act bore\r\nhard upon all bodies of Dissenters and Roman Catholics, the former of\r\nwhom were most cruelly persecuted in this reign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Secret Alliance with Louis\xc2\xa0XIV.]\r\n\r\nThe next most noticeable effort of Charles to extend his power\r\nindependently of the law, was his secret alliance with Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. This\r\nwas not known to the nation, and even but to few of his ministers, and\r\nwas the most disgraceful act of his reign. For the miserable stipend\r\nof two hundred thousand pounds a year, he was ready to compromise the\r\ninterests of the kingdom, and make himself the slave of the most\r\nambitious sovereign in Europe. He became a pensioner of France, and\r\nyet did not feel his disgrace. Clarendon, attached as he was to\r\nmonarchy, and to the house of Stuart, could not join him in his base\r\nintrigues; and therefore lost, as was to be expected, the royal favor.\r\nHe had been the companion and counsellor of Charles in the days of his\r\nexile; he had attempted to enkindle in his mind the desire of great\r\ndeeds and virtues; he had faithfully served him as chancellor and\r\nprime minister; he was impartial and incorruptible; he was as much\r\nattached to Episcopacy, as he was to monarchy; he had even advised\r\nCharles to rule without a parliament; and yet he was disgraced because\r\nhe would not comply with all the wishes of his unscrupulous master.\r\nBut Clarendon was, nevertheless, unpopular with the nation. He had\r\nadvised Charles to sell Dunkirk, the proudest trophy of the\r\nRevolution, and had built for himself a splendid palace, on the site\r\nof the present Clarendon Hotel, in Albemarle Street, which the people\r\ncalled _Dunkirk House_. He was proud, ostentatious, and dictatorial,\r\nand was bitterly hostile to all democratic influences. He was too good\r\nfor one party, and not good enough for the other, and therefore fell\r\nto the ground; but he retired, if not with dignity, at least with\r\nsafety. He retreated to the Continent, and there wrote his celebrated\r\nhistory of the Great Rebellion, a partial and bitter history, yet a\r\nvaluable record of the great events of the age of revolution which he\r\nhad witnessed and detested.\r\n\r\nCharles received the bribe of two hundred thousand pounds from the\r\nFrench king, with the hope of being made independent of his\r\nparliament, and with the condition of assisting Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. in his\r\naggressive wars on the liberties of Europe, especially those of\r\nHolland. He was, at heart an absolutist, and rejoiced in the victories\r\nof the "Grand Monarch." But this supply was scarcely sufficient even\r\nfor his pleasures, much less to support the ordinary pomp of a\r\nmonarchy, and the civil and military powers of the state. So he had to\r\nresort to other means.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Venality and Sycophancy of Parliament.]\r\n\r\nIt happened, fortunately for his encroachments, but unfortunately for\r\nthe nation, that the English parliament, at that period, was more\r\ncorrupt, venal, base, and sycophantic than at any period under the\r\nTudor kings, or at any subsequent period under the Hanoverian princes.\r\nThe House of Commons made no indignant resistance; it sent up but few\r\nspirited remonstrances; but tamely acquiesced in the measures of\r\nCharles and his ministers. Its members were bought and sold with\r\nunblushing facility, and even were corrupted by the agents of the\r\nFrench king. One member received six thousand pounds for his vote.\r\nTwenty-nine of the members received from five hundred to twelve\r\nhundred pounds a year. Charles\xc2\xa0I. attempted to rule by opposition to\r\nthe parliament; Charles\xc2\xa0II. by corrupting it. Hence it was nearly\r\nsilent in view of his arbitrary spirit, his repeated encroachments,\r\nand his worthless public character.\r\n\r\nAmong his worst acts was his shutting up the Exchequer, where the\r\nbankers and merchants had been in the habit of depositing money on the\r\nsecurity of the funds, receiving a large interest of from eight to ten\r\nper cent. By closing the Exchequer, the bankers, unable to draw out\r\ntheir money, stopped payment; and a universal panic was the\r\nconsequence, during which many great failures happened. By this base\r\nviolation of the public faith, Charles obtained one million three\r\nhundred thousand pounds. But it undermined his popularity more than\r\nany of his acts, since he touched the pockets of the people. The\r\nodium, however, fell chiefly on his ministers, especially those who\r\nreceived the name of the _Cabal_, from the fact that the initials of\r\ntheir names spelt that odious term of reproach, not unmerited in their\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThese five ministers were Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and\r\nLauderdale, and they were the great instruments of his tyranny. None\r\nof them had the talents or audacity of Strafford, or the narrowness\r\nand bigotry of Laud; but their counsels were injurious to the nation.\r\n\r\nClifford and Arlington were tolerably respectable but indifferent to\r\nthe glory and shame of their country; while Buckingham, Ashley, and\r\nLauderdale were profligate, unprincipled, and dishonest to a great\r\ndegree. They aided Charles to corrupt the parliament and deceive the\r\nnation. They removed all restraints on his will, and pandered to his\r\ndepraved tastes. It was by their suggestion that the king shut up the\r\nExchequer. They also favored restrictions on the press.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Restrictions on the Press.]\r\n\r\nThese restrictions were another abomination in the reign of Charles,\r\nbut one ever peculiar to a despotic government. No book could be\r\nprinted out of London, York, or the Universities. But these were not\r\nmade wholly with a view of shackling the mind, but to prevent those\r\nlibels and lampoons which made the government ridiculous in the eyes\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nNothing caused more popular indignation, during this reign, than the\r\nForfeiture of the Corporation of the City of London. The power of the\r\ndemocracy resided, at this time, with the corporations, and as long as\r\nthey were actuated by the spirit of liberty, there was no prospect of\r\nobtaining a parliament entirely subservient to the king. It was\r\ndetermined to take away their charters; and the infamous Judge\r\nJeffreys was found a most subservient tool of royalty in undermining\r\nthe liberties of the country. The corporation of London, however,\r\nreceived back its charter, after having yielded to the king the right\r\nof conferring the appointments of mayor, recorder, and sheriffs.\r\n\r\nAmong other infringements on the constitution was the fining of jurors\r\nwhen they refused to act according to the direction of the judges.\r\nJuries were constantly intimidated, and their privileges were\r\nabridged. A new parliament, moreover, was not convoked after three\r\nyears had elapsed from the dissolution of the old one, which\r\ninfringement was the more reprehensible, since the king had nothing to\r\nfear from the new House of Commons, the members of which vied with\r\neach other in a base compliancy with the royal will.\r\n\r\nBut their sycophancy was nothing compared with what the bishops and\r\nclergy of the Established Church generally evinced. Absolute\r\nnon-resistance was inculcated from the pulpits, and the doctrine\r\nridiculed that power emanated from the people. The divine rights of\r\nkings, and the divine ordination of absolute power were the themes of\r\ndivines, while Oxford proclaimed doctrines worthy of Mariana and the\r\nJesuits.\r\n\r\nThus various influences contributed to make Charles\xc2\xa0II. absolute in\r\nEngland--the Courts of Justice, the Parliaments, the Universities, and\r\nthe Church of England. Had he been as ambitious as he was fond of\r\npleasure, as capable of ruling as he was capable of telling stories at\r\nthe dinner table, he would, like Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., have reared an absolute\r\nthrone in England. But he was too easy, too careless, too fond of\r\npleasure to concentrate his thoughts on devising means to enslave his\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Habeas Corpus Act.]\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that all his subjects were\r\nindifferent to his encroachments, in spite of the great reaction which\r\nhad succeeded to liberal sentiments. Before he died, the spirit of\r\nresistance was beginning to be seen, and some checks to royal power\r\nwere imposed by parliament itself. The Habeas Corpus Act, the most\r\nimportant since the declaration of Magna Charta, was passed, and\r\nthrough the influence of one of his former ministers, Ashley, now\r\nbecome Earl of Shaftesbury, who took the popular side, after having\r\nserved all sides, but always with a view of advancing his own\r\ninterests, a man of great versatility of genius, of great sagacity,\r\nand of varied learning. Had Charles continued much longer on the\r\nthrone, it cannot be doubted that the nation would have been finally\r\naroused to resist his spirit of encroachment, for the principles of\r\nliberty had not been proclaimed in vain.\r\n\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0II. was a tyrant, and one of the worst kings that ever sat on\r\nthe English throne. His leading defect was want of earnestness of\r\ncharacter, which made him indifferent to the welfare of his country.\r\nEngland, during his reign, was reduced to comparative insignificance\r\nin the eyes of foreigners, and was neither feared nor respected. Her\r\nking was neither a powerful friend nor an implacable enemy, and left\r\nthe Continental Powers to pursue their own ends unmolested and\r\nunrebuked. Most of the administrations of the English kings are\r\ninterlinked with the whole system of European politics. But the reign\r\nof Charles is chiefly interesting in relation to the domestic history\r\nof England. This history is chiefly the cabals of ministers, the\r\nintrigues of the court, the pleasures and follies of the king, the\r\nattacks he made on the constitution without any direct warfare with\r\nhis parliament and the system of religious persecution, which was most\r\nintolerant.\r\n\r\nThe king was at heart a Catholic; and yet the persecution of the\r\nCatholics is one of the most signal events of the times. We can\r\nscarcely conceive, in this age, of the spirit of distrust and fear\r\nwhich pervaded the national mind in reference to the Catholics. Every\r\ncalumny was believed. Every trifling offence was exaggerated, and by\r\nnearly all classes in the community, by the Episcopalians, as well as\r\nby the Presbyterians and the Independents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Titus Oates.]\r\n\r\nThe most memorable of all the delusions and slanders of the times was\r\nproduced by the perjuries of an unprincipled wretch called Titus\r\nOates, who took advantage of the general infatuation to advance his\r\nindividual interests. Like an artful politician, he had only to appeal\r\nto a dominant passion or prejudice, and he was sure of making his\r\nfortune. Like a cunning, popular orator, he had only to inflame the\r\npassions of the people, and he would pass as a genius and a prophet.\r\nFew are so abstractedly and coldly intellectual as not to be mainly\r\ngoverned by their tastes or passions. Even men of strong intellect\r\nhave frequently strong prejudices, and one has only to make himself\r\nmaster of these, in order to lead those who are infinitely their\r\nsuperiors. There is no proof that all who persecuted the Catholics in\r\nCharles\'s time were either weak or ignorant. But there is evidence of\r\nunbounded animosity, a traditional hatred, not much diminished since\r\nthe Gunpowder Plot of Guy Fawkes. The whole nation was ready to\r\nbelieve any thing against the Catholics, and especially against their\r\nchurch, which was supposed to be persecuting and diabolical in all its\r\nprinciples and in all its practice. In this state of the popular mind,\r\nOates made his hideous revelations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oates\'s Revelations.]\r\n\r\nHe was a broken-down clergyman of the Established Church, and had lost\r\ncaste for disgraceful irregularities. But he professed to hate the\r\nCatholics, and such a virtue secured him friends. Among these was the\r\nRev. Dr. Tonge, a man very weak, very credulous, and full of fears\r\nrespecting the intrigues of the Catholics but honest in his fears.\r\nOates went to this clergyman, and a plan was concerted between them,\r\nby which Oates should get a knowledge of the supposed intrigues of the\r\nChurch of Rome. He professed himself a Catholic, went to the\r\nContinent, and entered a Catholic seminary, but was soon discharged\r\nfor his scandalous irregularities. But he had been a Catholic long\r\nenough for his purposes. He returned to London, and revealed his\r\npretended discoveries, among which he declared that the Jesuits had\r\nundertaken to restore the Catholic religion in England by force; that\r\nthey were resolved to take the king\'s life, and had actually offered a\r\nbribe of fifteen thousand pounds to the queen\'s physician; that they\r\nhad planned to burn London, and to set fire to all the shipping in the\r\nThames; that they were plotting to make a general massacre of the\r\nProtestants; that a French army was about to invade England; and that\r\nall the horrors of St. Bartholomew were to be again acted over!\r\nRidiculous as were these assertions, they were believed, and without a\r\nparticle of evidence; so great was the national infatuation. The king\r\nand the Duke of York both pronounced the whole matter a forgery, and\r\nlaughed at the credulity of the people, but had not sufficient\r\ngenerosity to prevent the triumph of the libellers. But Oates\'s\r\ntestimony was not enough to convict any one, the law requiring two\r\nwitnesses. But, in such a corrupt age, false witnesses could easily be\r\nprocured. An infamous wretch, by the name of Bedloe, was bribed, a man\r\nwho had been imprisoned in Newgate for swindling. Others equally\r\nunscrupulous were soon added to the list of informers, and no\r\ncalumnies, however gross and absurd, prevented the people from\r\nbelieving them.\r\n\r\nIt happened that a man, by the name of Coleman, was suspected of\r\nintrigues. His papers were searched, and some passages in them,\r\nunfortunately, seemed to confirm the statements of Oates. To impartial\r\neyes, these papers simply indicated a desire and a hope that the\r\nCatholic religion would be re\xc3\xabstablished, in view of the predilections\r\nof Charles and James, and the general posture of affairs, just as some\r\nenthusiastic Jesuit missionary in the valley of the Mississippi may be\r\nsupposed to write to his superior that America is on the eve of\r\nconversion to Catholicism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Penal Laws against Catholics.]\r\n\r\nBut the general ferment was still more increased by the disappearance\r\nof an eminent justice of the peace, who had taken the depositions of\r\nOates against Coleman. Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey was found dead, and\r\nwith every mark of violence, in a field near London, and was probably\r\nmurdered by some fanatical persons in the communion of the Church of\r\nRome. But if so, the murder was a great blunder. It was worse than a\r\ncrime. The whole community were mad with rage and fear. The old penal\r\nlaws were strictly enforced against the Catholics. The jails were\r\nfilled with victims. London wore the appearance of a besieged city.\r\nThe houses of the Catholics were every where searched, and two\r\nthousand of them imprisoned. Posts were planted in the street, that\r\nchains might be thrown across them on the first alarm. The military,\r\nthe train bands, and the volunteers were called out. Forty thousand\r\nmen were kept under guard during the night. Numerous patrols paraded\r\nthe streets. The gates of the Palace were closed, and the guards of\r\nthe city were doubled. Oates was pronounced to be the savior of his\r\ncountry, lodged at Whitehall and pensioned with twelve hundred pounds\r\na year.\r\n\r\nThen flowed more innocent blood than had been shed for a long period.\r\nCatholics who were noble, and Catholics who were obscure, were alike\r\njudicially murdered; and the courts of justice, instead of being\r\nplaces of refuge, were disgraced by the foulest abominations. Every\r\nday new witnesses were produced of crimes which never happened, and\r\nnew victims were offered up to appease the wrath of a prejudiced\r\npeople. Among these victims of popular frenzy was the Earl of\r\nStafford, a venerable and venerated nobleman of sixty-nine years of\r\nage, against whom sufficient evidence was not found to convict him;\r\nand whose only crime was in being at the head of the Catholic party.\r\nYet he was found guilty by the House of Peers, fifty-five out of\r\neighty-six having voted for his execution. He died on the scaffold,\r\nbut with the greatest serenity, forgiving his persecutors, and\r\ncompassionating their delusions. A future generation, during the reign\r\nof George\xc2\xa0IV., however, reversed his attainder, and did justice to his\r\nmemory, and restored his descendants to their rank and fortune.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persecution of Dissenters.]\r\n\r\nIf no other illustrious victims suffered, persecution was nevertheless\r\ndirected into other channels. Parliament passed an act that no person\r\nshould sit in either House, unless he had previously taken the oath of\r\nallegiance and supremacy, and subscribed to the declaration that the\r\nworship of the Church of Rome was idolatrous. Catholics were disabled\r\nfrom prosecuting a suit in any court of law, from receiving any\r\nlegacy, and from acting as executors or administrators of estates.\r\nThis horrid bill, which outlawed the whole Catholic population, had\r\nrepeatedly miscarried, but, under influence of the panic which Oates\r\nand his confederates created, was now triumphantly passed. Charles\r\nhimself gave his royal assent because he was afraid to stem the\r\ntorrent of popular infatuation. And the English nation permitted one\r\nhundred and thirty years to elapse before the civil disabilities of\r\nthe Catholics were removed, and then only by the most strenuous\r\nexertions of such a statesman as Sir Robert Peel.\r\n\r\nIt is some satisfaction to know that justice at last overtook the\r\nchief authors of this diabolical infatuation. During the reign of\r\nJames\xc2\xa0II., Oates and others were punished as they deserved. Oates\'s\r\ncredit gradually passed away. He was fined, imprisoned, and whipped at\r\nthe pillory until life itself had nearly fled. He died unlamented and\r\ndetested, leaving behind him, to all posterity an infamous notoriety.\r\n\r\nBut the sufferings of the Catholics, during this reign, were more than\r\nexceeded by the sufferings of Dissenters, who were cruelly persecuted.\r\nAll the various sects of the Protestants were odious and ridiculous in\r\nthe eyes of the king. They were regarded as hostile in their\r\nsympathies, and treasonable in their designs. They were fined,\r\nimprisoned, mutilated, and whipped. An Act of Uniformity was passed,\r\nwhich restored the old penal laws of Elizabeth, and which subjected\r\nall to their penalty who did not use the Book of Common Prayer, and\r\nadhere strictly to the ritual of the Church of England. The\r\noligarchical power of the bishops was restored, and two thousand\r\nministers were driven from their livings, and compelled to seek a\r\nprecarious support. Many other acts of flagrant injustice were passed\r\nby a subservient parliament, and cruelly carried into execution by\r\nunfeeling judges. But the religious persecution of dissenters was not\r\nconsummated until the reign of James under whose favor or direction\r\nthe inhuman Jeffreys inflicted the most atrocious crimes which have\r\never been committed under the sanction of the law. But these will be\r\nmore appropriately noticed under the reign of James\xc2\xa0II. Charles was\r\nnot so cruel in his temper, or bigoted in his sentiments, as his\r\nbrother James. He was rather a Gallio than a persecutor. He would\r\npermit any thing rather than suffer himself to be interrupted in his\r\npleasures. He was governed by his favorites and his women. He had not\r\nsufficient moral elevation to be earnest in any thing, even to be a\r\nbigot in religion. He vacillated between the infidelity of Hobbes and\r\nthe superstitions of Rome. He lived a scoffer, and died a Catholic.\r\nHis temper was easy, but so easy as not to prevent the persecution and\r\nruin of his best supporters, when they had become odious to the\r\nnation. If he was incapable of enmity, he was also incapable of\r\nfriendship. If he hated no one with long-continued malignity, it was\r\nonly because it was too much trouble to hate perseveringly. But he\r\nloved with no more constancy than he hated. He had no patriotism, and\r\nno appreciation of moral excellence. He would rather see half of the\r\nmerchants of London ruined, and half of the Dissenters immured in\r\ngloomy prisons, than lose two hours of inglorious dalliance with one\r\nof his numerous concubines. A more contemptible prince never sat on\r\nthe English throne, or one whose whole reign was disgraced by a more\r\nconstant succession of political blunders and social crimes. And yet\r\nhe never fully lost his popularity, nor was his reign felt to be as\r\nburdensome as was that of the protector, Cromwell, thus showing how\r\nlittle the moral excellence of rulers is ordinarily appreciated or\r\nvalued by a wilful or blinded generation. We love not the rebukers of\r\nour sins, or the opposers of our pleasures. We love those who prophesy\r\nsmooth things, and "cry peace, when there is no peace." Such is man in\r\nhis weakness and his degeneracy; and only an omnipotent power can\r\nchange this ordinary temper of the devotees to pleasure and inglorious\r\ngains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Execution of Russell and Sydney.]\r\n\r\nAmong the saddest events during the reign of Charles, were the\r\nexecutions of Lord Russell and Algernon Sydney. They were concerned,\r\nwith a few other great men, in a conspiracy, which had for its object\r\nthe restoration of greater liberty. They contemplated an insurrection,\r\nknown by the name of the _Rye House Plot_; but it was discovered, and\r\nRussell and Sydney became martyrs. The former was the son of the Earl\r\nof Bedford, and the latter was the brother of the Earl of Leicester.\r\nRussell was a devoted Churchman, of pure morals, and greatly beloved\r\nby the people. Sydney was a strenuous republican, and was opposed to\r\nany particular form of church government. He thought that religion\r\nshould be like a divine philosophy in the mind, and had great\r\nveneration for the doctrines of Plato. Nothing could save these\r\nillustrious men. The Duke of York and Jeffreys declared that, if they\r\nwere not executed, there would be no safety for themselves. They both\r\nsuffered with great intrepidity, and the friends of liberty have ever\r\nsince cherished their memory with peculiar fondness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manners and Customs of England.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Milton--Dryden.]\r\n\r\nMr. Macaulay, in his recent History, has presented the manners and\r\ncustoms of England during the disgraceful reign of Charles\xc2\xa0II. It is\r\nimpossible, in this brief survey, to allude to all those customs; but\r\nwe direct particularly the attention of readers to them, as described\r\nin his third chapter, from which it would appear, that a most manifest\r\nand most glorious progress has been made since that period in all the\r\narts of civilization, both useful and ornamental. In those times,\r\ntravelling was difficult and slow, from the badness of the roads and\r\nthe imperfections of the carriages. Highwaymen were secreted along the\r\nthoroughfares, and, in mounted troops, defied the law, and distressed\r\nthe whole travelling community. The transmission of letters by post\r\nwas tardy and unfrequent, and the scandal of coffee-houses supplied\r\nthe greatest want and the greatest luxury of modern times, the\r\nnewspaper. There was great scarcity of books in the country places,\r\nand the only press in England north of the Trent seems to have been at\r\nYork. Literature was but feebly cultivated by country squires or\r\ncountry parsons, and female education was disgracefully neglected. Few\r\nrich men had libraries as large or valuable as are now common to\r\nshopkeepers and mechanics; while the literary stores of a lady of the\r\nmanor were confined chiefly to the prayer-book and the receipt-book.\r\nAnd those works which were produced or read were disgraced by\r\nlicentious ribaldry, which had succeeded religious austerity. The\r\ndrama was the only department of literature which compensated authors,\r\nand this was scandalous in the extreme. We cannot turn over the pages\r\nof one of the popular dramatists of the age without being shocked by\r\nthe most culpable indecency. Even Dryden was no exception to the rule;\r\nand his poetry, some of which is the most beautiful in the language,\r\ncan hardly be put into the hands of the young without danger of\r\ncorrupting them. Poets and all literary men lived by the bounty of the\r\nrich and great, and prospered only as they pandered to depraved\r\npassions. Many, of great intellectual excellence, died from want and\r\nmortification; so that the poverty and distress of literary men became\r\nproverbial, and all worldly-wise people shunned contact with them as\r\nexpensive and degrading. They were hunted from cocklofts to cellars by\r\nthe minions of the law, and the foulest jails were often their only\r\nresting-place. The restoration of Charles proved unfortunate to one\r\ngreat and immortal genius, whom no temptations could assail, and no\r\nrewards could bribe. He "possessed his soul in patience," and "soared\r\nabove the Aonian mount," amid general levity and profligacy. Had he\r\nwritten for a pure, classic, and learned age, he could not have\r\nwritten with greater moral beauty. But he lived when no moral\r\nexcellence was appreciated, and his claims on the gratitude of the\r\nworld are beyond all estimation, when we remember that he wrote with\r\nthe full consciousness, like the great Bacon, that his works would\r\nonly be valued or read by future generations. Milton was, indeed,\r\nunmolested; but he was sadly neglected in his blindness and in his\r\ngreatness. But, like all the great teachers of the world, he was\r\nsustained by something higher than earthly applause, and labored, like\r\nan immortal artist, from the love which his labor excited,--labored to\r\nrealize the work of art which his imagination had conceived, as well\r\nas to propagate ideas and sentiments which should tend to elevate\r\nmankind. Dryden was his contemporary, but obtained a greater homage,\r\nnot because he was more worthy, but because he adapted his genius to\r\nthe taste of a frivolous and corrupt people. He afterwards wrote more\r\nunexceptionably, composed lyrics instead of farces, and satires\r\ninstead of plays. In his latter days, he could afford to write in a\r\npurer style; and, as he became independent, he reared the\r\nsuperstructure of his glorious fame. But Dryden spent the best parts\r\nof his life as a panderer to the vices of the town, and was an idol\r\nchiefly, in Wills\'s Coffee House, of lampooners, and idlers, and\r\nscandal-mongers. Nor were there many people, in the church or in the\r\nstate, sufficiently influential and noble to stem the torrent. The\r\ncity clergy were the most respectable, and the pulpits of London were\r\noccupied with twelve men who afterwards became bishops, and who are\r\namong the great ornaments of the sacred literature of their country.\r\nSherlock, Tillotson, Wake, Collier, Burnet, Stillingfleet, Patrick,\r\nFowler, Sharp, Tennison, and Beveridge made the Established Church\r\nrespected in the town; but the country clergy, as a whole, were\r\nignorant and depressed. Not one living in fifty enabled the incumbent\r\nto bring up a family comfortably or respectably. The clergyman was\r\ndisdained even by the county attorney, was hardly tolerated at the\r\ntable of his patron, and could scarcely marry beyond the rank of a\r\ncook or housekeeper. And his poverty and bondage continued so long\r\nthat, in the times of Swift, the parson was a byword and a jest among\r\nthe various servants in the households of the great. Still there were\r\neminent clergymen amid the general depression of their order, both in\r\nand out of the Established Church. Besides the London preachers were\r\nmany connected with the Universities and Cathedrals; and there were\r\nsome distinguished Dissenters, among whom Baxter, Howe, and Alleine if\r\nthere were no others, would alone have made the name of Puritan\r\nrespectable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condition of the People.]\r\n\r\nThe saddest fact, in connection with the internal history of England,\r\nat this time, was the condition of the people. They had small wages,\r\nand many privations. They had no social rank, and were disgraced by\r\nmany vices. They were ignorant and brutal. The wages of laborers only\r\naveraged four shillings a week, while those of mechanics were not\r\nequal to what some ordinarily earn, in this country and in these\r\ntimes, in a single day. Both peasants, and artisans were not only ill\r\npaid, but ill used, and they died, miserably and prematurely, from\r\nfamine and disease. Nor did sympathy exist for the misfortunes of the\r\npoor. There were no institutions of public philanthropy. Jails were\r\nunvisited by the ministers of mercy, and the abodes of poverty were\r\nleft by a careless generation to be dens of infamy and crime. Such was\r\nEngland two hundred years ago; and there is no delusion more\r\nunwarranted by sober facts than that which supposes that those former\r\ntimes were better than our own, in any thing which abridges the labors\r\nor alleviates the miseries of mankind. "It is now the fashion to place\r\nthe golden age of England in times when noblemen were destitute of\r\ncomforts the want of which would be intolerable to a modern footman;\r\nwhen farmers and shopkeepers breakfasted on loaves the very sight of\r\nwhich would raise a riot in a modern workhouse, when men died faster\r\nin the purest country air than they now die in the most pestilential\r\nlanes of our towns; and when men died faster in the lanes of our towns\r\nthan they now die on the coast of Guinea. But we too shall, in our\r\nturn, be outstripped, and, in our turn, envied. There is constant\r\nimprovement, as there also is constant discontent; and future\r\ngenerations may talk of the reign of Queen Victoria as a time when\r\nEngland was truly merry England, when all classes were bound together\r\nby brotherly sympathy, when the rich did not grind the faces of the\r\npoor, and when the poor did not envy the splendor of the rich."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Of all the works which have yet appeared,\r\n     respecting this interesting epoch, the new History of\r\n     Macaulay is the most brilliant and instructive. Indeed, the\r\n     student scarcely needs any other history, in spite of\r\n     Macaulay\'s Whig doctrines. He may sacrifice something to\r\n     effect; and he may give us pictures, instead of philosophy;\r\n     but, nevertheless, his book has transcendent merit, and will\r\n     be read, by all classes, so long as English history is\r\n     prized. Mackintosh\'s fragment, on the same period, is more\r\n     philosophical, and possesses very great merits. Lingard\'s\r\n     History is very valuable on this reign, and should be\r\n     consulted. Hume, also, will never cease to please. Burnet is\r\n     a prejudiced historian, but his work is an authority. The\r\n     lives of Milton, Dryden, and Clarendon should also be read\r\n     in this connection. Hallam has but treated the\r\n     constitutional history of these times. See also Temple\'s\r\n     Works; the Life of William Lord Russell; Rapin\'s History.\r\n     Pepys, Dalrymple, Rymeri Foedera, the Commons\' Journal, and\r\n     the Howell State Trials are not easily accessible, and not\r\n     necessary, except to the historian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\xc2\xa0XV.\r\n\r\nREIGN OF JAMES\xc2\xa0II.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accession of James\xc2\xa0II.]\r\n\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0II. died on the 6th of February, 1685, and his brother, the\r\nDuke of York, ascended his throne, without opposition, under the title\r\nof _James\xc2\xa0II._ As is usual with princes, on their accession, he made\r\nmany promises of ruling by the laws, and of defending the liberties of\r\nthe nation. And he commenced his administration under good auspices.\r\nThe country was at peace, he was not unpopular, and all classes and\r\nparties readily acquiesced in his government.\r\n\r\nHe retained all the great officers who had served under his brother\r\nthat he could trust; and Rochester became prime minister, Sunderland\r\nkept possession of the Seals, and Godolphin was made lord chamberlain.\r\nHe did not dismiss Halifax, Ormond, or Guildford, although he disliked\r\nand distrusted them, but abridged their powers, and mortified them by\r\nneglect.\r\n\r\nThe Commons voted him one million two hundred thousand pounds, and the\r\nScottish parliament added twenty-five thousand pounds more, and the\r\nCustoms for life. But this sum he did not deem sufficient for his\r\nwants, and therefore, like his brother, applied for aid to Louis\xc2\xa0XIV.,\r\nand consented to become his pensioner and vassal, and for the paltry\r\nsum of two hundred thousand pounds. James received the money with\r\ntears of gratitude, hoping by this infamous pension to rule the nation\r\nwithout a parliament. It was not, of course, known to the nation, or\r\neven to his ministers, generally.\r\n\r\nHe was scarcely crowned before England was invaded by the Duke of\r\nMonmouth, natural son of Charles\xc2\xa0II., and Scotland by the Duke of\r\nArgyle, with a view of ejecting James from the throne.\r\n\r\nBoth these noblemen were exiles in Holland, and both were justly\r\nobnoxious to the government for their treasonable intentions and acts.\r\nArgyle was loath to engage in an enterprise so desperate as the\r\nconquest of England; but he was an enthusiast, was at the head of the\r\nmost powerful of the Scottish clans, the Campbells, and he hoped for a\r\ngeneral rising throughout Scotland, to put down what was regarded as\r\nidolatry, and to strike a blow for liberty and the Kirk.\r\n\r\nHaving concerted his measures with Monmouth, he set sail from Holland,\r\nthe 2d of May, 1685, in spite of all the efforts of the English\r\nminister, and landed at Kirkwall, one of the Orkney Islands. But his\r\nobjects were well known, and the whole militia of the land were put\r\nunder arms to resist him. He, however, collected a force of two\r\nthousand five hundred Highlanders, and marched towards Glasgow; but he\r\nwas miserably betrayed and deserted. His forces were dispersed, and he\r\nhimself was seized while attempting to escape in disguise, brought to\r\nEdinburgh, and beheaded. His followers were treated with great\r\nharshness, but the rebellion was completely suppressed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monmouth Lands in England.]\r\n\r\nMonmouth had agreed to sail in six days from the departure of Argyle;\r\nbut he lingered at Brussels, loath to part from a beautiful mistress,\r\nthe Lady Henrietta Wentworth. It was a month before he set sail from\r\nthe Texel, with about eighty officers and one hundred and fifty\r\nfollowers--a small force to overturn the throne. But he relied on his\r\npopularity with the people, and on a false and exaggerated account of\r\nthe unpopularity of James. He landed at Lyme, in Dorsetshire, about\r\nthe middle of June, and forthwith issued a flaming proclamation,\r\ninviting all to join his standard, as a deliverer from the cruel\r\ndespotism of a Catholic prince, whom he accused of every crime--of the\r\nburning of London, of the Popish Plot, of the condemnation of Russell\r\nand Sydney, of poisoning the late king, and of infringements on the\r\nconstitution. In this declaration, falsehood was mingled with truth,\r\nbut well adapted to inflame the passions of the people. He was\r\nsupported by many who firmly believed that his mother, Lucy Walters,\r\nwas the lawful wife of Charles\xc2\xa0II. He, of course, claimed the English\r\nthrone, but professed to waive his rights until they should be settled\r\nby a parliament. The adventurer grossly misunderstood the temper of\r\nthe people, and the extent to which his claims were recognized. He was\r\nunprovided with money, with generals, and with troops. He collected a\r\nfew regiments from the common people, and advanced to Somersetshire.\r\nAt Taunton his reception was flattering. All classes welcomed him as a\r\ndeliverer from Heaven, and the poor rent the air with acclamations and\r\nshouts. His path was strewed with flowers, and the windows were\r\ncrowded with ladies, who waved their handkerchiefs, and even waited\r\nupon him with a large deputation. Twenty-six lovely maidens presented\r\nthe handsome son of Charles\xc2\xa0II. with standards and a Bible, which he\r\nkissed, and promised to defend.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Sedgemoor.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Monmouth.]\r\n\r\nBut all this enthusiasm was soon to end. The Duke of Albemarle--the\r\nson of General Monk, who restored Charles\xc2\xa0II.--advanced against him\r\nwith the militia of the country, and Monmouth was supported only by\r\nthe vulgar, the weak, and the credulous. Not a single nobleman joined\r\nhis standard, and but few of the gentry. He made innumerable blunders.\r\nHe lost time by vain attempts to drill the peasants and farmers who\r\nfollowed his fortunes. He slowly advanced to the west of England,\r\nwhere he hoped to be joined by the body of the people. But all men of\r\nstation and influence stood aloof. Discouraged and dismayed, he\r\nreached Wells, and pushed forward to capture Bristol, then the second\r\ncity in the kingdom. He was again disappointed. He was forced, from\r\nunexpected calamities, to abandon the enterprise. He then turned his\r\neye to Wilts; but when he arrived at the borders of the county, he\r\nfound that none of the bodies on which he had calculated had made\r\ntheir appearance. At Phillips Norton was a slight skirmish, which\r\nended favorably to Monmouth, in which the young Duke of Grafton,\r\nnatural son of Charles\xc2\xa0II., distinguished himself against his half\r\nbrother; but Monmouth was discouraged, and fell back to Bridgewater.\r\nMeanwhile the royal army approached, and encamped at Sedgemoor. Here\r\nwas fought a decisive battle, which was fatal to the rebels, "the last\r\ndeserving the name of _battle_, that has been fought on English\r\nground." Monmouth, when all was lost, fled from the field, and\r\nhastened to the British Channel, hoping to gain the Continent. He was\r\nfound near the New Forest, hidden in a ditch, exhausted by hunger and\r\nfatigue. He was sent, under a strong guard, to Ringwood; and all that\r\nwas left him was, to prepare to meet the death of a rebel. But he\r\nclung to life, so justly forfeited, with singular tenacity. He\r\nabjectly and meanly sued for pardon from that inexorable tyrant who\r\nnever forgot or forgave the slightest resistance from a friend, when\r\neven that resistance was lawful, much less rebellion from a man he\r\nboth hated and despised. He was transferred to London, lodged in the\r\nTower, and executed in a bungling manner by "Jack Ketch"--the name\r\ngiven for several centuries to the public executioner. He was buried\r\nunder St. Peter\'s Chapel, in the Tower, where reposed the headless\r\nbodies of so many noted saints and political martyrs--the great\r\nSomerset, and the still greater Northumberland, the two Earls of\r\nEssex, and the fourth Duke of Norfolk, and other great men who figured\r\nin the reigns of the Plantagenets and the Tudors.\r\n\r\nMonmouth\'s rebellion was completely suppressed, and a most signal\r\nvengeance was inflicted on all who were concerned in it. No mercy was\r\nshown, on the part of government, to any party or person.\r\n\r\nOf the agents of James in punishing all concerned in the rebellion,\r\nthere were two, pre\xc3\xabminently, whose names are consigned to an infamous\r\nimmortality. The records of English history contain no two names so\r\nloathsome and hateful as Colonel Kirke and Judge Jeffreys.\r\n\r\nThe former was left, by Feversham, in command of the royal forces at\r\nBridgewater, after the battle of Sedgemoor. He had already gained an\r\nunenviable notoriety, as governor of Tangier, where he displayed the\r\nworst vices of a tyrant and a sensualist; and his regiment had\r\nimitated him in his disgraceful brutality. But this leader and these\r\ntroops were now let loose on the people of Somersetshire. One hundred\r\ncaptives were put to death during the week which succeeded the battle.\r\nHis irregular butcheries, however, were not according to the taste of\r\nthe king. A more systematic slaughter, under the sanctions of the law,\r\nwas devised, and Jeffreys was sent into the Western Circuit, to try\r\nthe numerous persons who were immured in the jails of the western\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nSir George Jeffreys, Chief Justice of the Court of the King\'s Bench,\r\nwas not deficient in talent, but was constitutionally the victim of\r\nviolent passions. He first attracted notice as an insolent barrister\r\nat the Old Bailey Court, who had a rare tact in cross-examining\r\ncriminals and browbeating witnesses. According to Macaulay, "impudence\r\nand ferocity sat upon his brow, while all tenderness for the feelings\r\nof others, all self-respect, all sense of the becoming, were\r\nobliterated from his mind. He acquired a boundless command of the\r\nrhetoric in which the vulgar express hatred and contempt. The\r\nprofusion of his maledictions could hardly be rivalled in the Fish\r\nMarket or Bear Garden. His yell of fury sounded, as one who often\r\nheard it said, like the thunder of the judgment day. He early became\r\ncommon serjeant, and then recorder of London. As soon as he obtained\r\nall the city could give, he made haste to sell his forehead of brass\r\nand his tongue of venom to the court." He was just the man whom\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0II. wanted as a tool. He was made chief justice of the highest\r\ncourt of criminal law in the realm, and discharged its duties entirely\r\nto the satisfaction of a king resolved on the subjection of the\r\nEnglish nation. His violence, at all times, was frightful; but when he\r\nwas drunk, it was terrific: and he was generally intoxicated. His\r\nfirst exploit was the judicial murder of Algernon Sydney. On the death\r\nof Charles, he obtained from James a peerage, and a seat in the\r\nCabinet, a signal mark of royal approbation. In prospect of yet\r\ngreater honors, he was ready to do whatever James required. James\r\nwished the most summary vengeance inflicted on the rebels, and\r\nJeffreys, with his tiger ferocity, was ready to execute his will.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brutality of Jeffreys.]\r\n\r\nNothing is more memorable than those "bloody assizes" which he held in\r\nthose counties through which Monmouth had passed. Nothing is\r\nremembered with more execration. Nothing ever equalled the brutal\r\ncruelty of the judge. His fury seemed to be directed with peculiar\r\nviolence upon the Dissenters. "Show me," said he, "a Presbyterian, and\r\nI will show thee a lying knave. Presbyterianism has all manner of\r\nvillany in it. There is not one of those lying, snivelling, canting\r\nPresbyterians, but, one way or another, has had a hand in the\r\nrebellion." He sentenced nearly all who were accused, to be hanged or\r\nburned; and the excess of his barbarities called forth pity and\r\nindignation even from devoted loyalists. He boasted that he had hanged\r\nmore traitors than all his predecessors together since the Conquest.\r\nOn a single circuit, he hanged three hundred and fifty; some of these\r\nwere people of great worth, and many of them were innocent; while many\r\nwhom he spared from an ignominious death, were sentenced to the most\r\ncruel punishments--to the lash of the pillory, to imprisonment in the\r\nfoulest jails, to mutilation, to banishment, and to heavy fines.\r\n\r\nKing James watched the conduct of the inhuman Jeffreys with delight,\r\nand rewarded him with the Great Seal. The Old Bailey lawyer had now\r\nclimbed to the greatest height to which a subject could aspire. He was\r\nLord Chancellor of England--the confidential friend and agent of the\r\nking, and his unscrupulous instrument in imposing the yoke of bondage\r\non an insulted nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persecution of the Dissenters.]\r\n\r\nAt this period, the condition of the Puritans was deplorable. At no\r\nprevious time was persecution more inveterate, not even under the\r\nadministration of Laud and Strafford. The persecution commenced soon\r\nafter the restoration of Charles\xc2\xa0II., and increased in malignity until\r\nthe elevation of Jeffreys to the chancellorship. The sufferings of no\r\nclass of sectaries bore any proportion to theirs. They found it\r\ndifficult to meet together for prayer or exhortation even in the\r\nsmallest assemblies. Their ministers were introduced in disguise.\r\nTheir houses were searched. They were fined, imprisoned, and banished.\r\nAmong the ministers who were deprived of their livings, were Gilpin,\r\nBates, Howe, Owen, Baxter, Calamy, Poole, Charnock, and Flavel, who\r\nstill, after a lapse of one hundred and fifty years, enjoy a\r\nwide-spread reputation as standard writers on theological subjects.\r\nThese great lights of the seventeenth century were doomed to privation\r\nand poverty, with thousands of their brethren, most of whom had been\r\neducated at the Universities, and were among the best men in the\r\nkingdom. All the Stuart kings hated the Dissenters, but none hated\r\nthem more than Charles\xc2\xa0II. and James\xc2\xa0II. Under their sanction,\r\ncomplying parliaments passed repeated acts of injustice and cruelty.\r\nThe laws which were enacted during Queen Elizabeth\'s reign were\r\nre\xc3\xabnacted and enforced. The Act of Uniformity, in one day, ejected two\r\nthousand ministers from their parishes, because they refused to\r\nconform to the standard of the Established Church. The Conventicle Act\r\nordained that if any person, above sixteen years of age, should be\r\npresent at any religious meeting, in any other manner than allowed by\r\nthe Church of England, he should suffer three months\' imprisonment, or\r\npay a fine of five pounds, that six months imprisonment and ten pounds\r\nfine should be inflicted as a penalty for the second offence, and\r\nbanishment for the third. Married women taken at "conventicles," were\r\nsentenced to twelve months\' imprisonment. It is calculated that\r\ntwenty-five thousand Dissenters were immured in gloomy prisons, and\r\nthat four thousand of the sect of the Quakers died during their\r\nimprisonment in consequence of the filth and malaria of the jails,\r\nadded to cruel treatment.\r\n\r\nAmong the illustrious men who suffered most unjustly, was Richard\r\nBaxter, the glory of the Presbyterian party. He was minister at\r\nKidderminster, where he was content to labor in an humble sphere,\r\nhaving refused a bishopric. He had written one hundred and forty-five\r\ndistinct treatises, in two hundred volumes, which were characterized\r\nfor learning and talent. But neither his age, nor piety, nor\r\ncommanding virtues could screen him from the cruelties of Jeffreys;\r\nand, in fifteen years, he was five times imprisoned. His sufferings\r\ndrew tears from Sir Matthew Hale, with whose friendship he had been\r\nhonored. "But he who had enjoyed the confidence of the best of judges,\r\nwas cruelly insulted by the worst." When he wished to plead his cause,\r\nthe drunken chief justice replied, "O Richard, Richard, thou art an\r\nold fellow and an old knave. Thou hast written books enough to load a\r\ncart, every one of which is as full of sedition as an egg is full of\r\nmeat. I know that thou hast a mighty party, and I see a great many of\r\nthe brotherhood in corners, and a doctor of divinity at your elbow;\r\nbut, by the grace of God, I will crush you all."\r\n\r\nEntirely a different man was John Bunyan, not so influential or\r\nlearned, but equally worthy. He belonged to the sect of the Baptists,\r\nand stands at the head of all unlettered men of genius--the most\r\nsuccessful writer of allegory that any age has seen. The Pilgrim\'s\r\nProgress is the most popular religious work ever published, full of\r\ngenius and beauty, and a complete exhibition of the Calvinistic\r\ntheology, and the experiences of the Christian life. This book shows\r\nthe triumph of genius over learning, and the people\'s appreciation of\r\nexalted merit. Its author, an illiterate tinker, a travelling\r\npreacher, who spent the best part of his life between the houses of\r\nthe poor and the county jails, the object of reproach and ignominy,\r\nnow, however, takes a proud place, in the world\'s estimation, with the\r\nmaster minds of all nations--with Dante, Shakspeare, and Milton. He\r\nhas arisen above the prejudices of the great and fashionable; and the\r\nlearned and aristocratic Southey has sought to be the biographer of\r\nhis sorrows and the expounder of his visions. The proud bishops who\r\ndisdained him, the haughty judges who condemned him, are now chiefly\r\nknown as his persecutors, while he continues to be more honored and\r\nextolled with every succeeding generation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: George Fox.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persecution of the Quakers.]\r\n\r\nAnother illustrious victim of religious persecution in that age,\r\nillustrious in our eyes, but ignoble in the eyes of his\r\ncontemporaries, was George Fox, the founder of the sect of the\r\nQuakers. He, like Bunyan, was of humble birth and imperfect education.\r\nLike him, he derived his knowledge from communion with his own\r\nsoul--from inward experiences--from religious contemplations. He was a\r\nman of vigorous intellect, and capable of intense intellectual action.\r\nHis first studies were the mysteries of theology--the great questions\r\nrespecting duty and destiny; and these agitated his earnest mind\r\nalmost to despair. In his anxiety, he sought consolation from the\r\nclergy, but they did not remove the burdens of his soul. Like an old\r\nSyriac monk, he sought the fields and unfrequented solitudes, where he\r\ngave loose to his imagination, and where celestial beings came to\r\ncomfort him. He despised alike the reasonings of philosophers, the\r\ndogmas of divines, and the disputes of wrangling sectarians. He rose\r\nabove all their prejudices, and sought light and truth from original\r\nsources. His peace was based on the conviction that God\'s Holy Spirit\r\nspoke directly to his soul; and this was above reason, above\r\nauthority, a surer guide than any outward or written revelation. While\r\nthis divine voice was above the Scriptures, it never conflicted with\r\nthem, for they were revealed also to inspired men. Hence the\r\nScriptures were not to be disdained, but were to be a guide, and\r\nliterally to be obeyed. He would not swear, or fight, to save his\r\nlife, nor to save a world, because he was directly commanded to\r\nabstain from swearing and fighting. He abhorred all principles of\r\nexpediency, and would do right, or what the inspired voice within him\r\nassured him to be right, regardless of all consequences and all\r\ntribulations. He believed in the power of justice to protect itself,\r\nand reposed on the moral dignity of virtue. Love, to his mind, was an\r\nomnipotent weapon. He disdained force to accomplish important ends,\r\nand sought no control over government, except by intelligence. He\r\nbelieved that ideas and truth alone were at the basis of all great and\r\npermanent revolutions; these he was ever ready to declare; these were\r\nsure to produce, in the end, all needed reforms; these would be\r\nrevealed to the earnest inquirer. He disliked all forms and pompous\r\nceremonials in the worship of God, for they seemed useless and\r\nidolatrous. God was a Spirit, and to be worshipped in spirit and in\r\ntruth. And set singing was to be dispensed with, like set forms of\r\nprayer, and only edifying as prompted by the Spirit. He even objected\r\nto splendid places for the worship of God, and dispensed with\r\nsteeples, and bells, and organs. The sacraments, too, were needless,\r\nbeing mere symbols, or shadows of better things, not obligatory, but\r\nto be put on the same footing as those Jewish ceremonies which the\r\nSavior abrogated. The mind of Fox discarded all aids to devotion, all\r\ntitles of honor, all distinctions which arose in pride and egotism.\r\nHypocrisy he abhorred with his whole soul. It was the vice of the\r\nPharisees, on whom Christ denounced the severest judgments. He, too,\r\nwould denounce it with the most unsparing severity, whenever he\r\nfancied he detected it in rulers, or in venerated dignitaries of the\r\nchurch, or in the customs of conventional life. He sought simplicity\r\nand sincerity in all their forms. Truth alone should be his polar\r\nstar, and this would be revealed by the "inner light," the peculiar\r\ngenius of his whole system, which, if it led to many new views of duty\r\nand holiness, yet was the cause of many delusions, and the parent of\r\nconceit and spiritual pride--the grand peculiarity of fanaticism in\r\nall ages and countries. What so fruitful a source of error as the\r\nnotion of special divine illumination?\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Fox and his followers were persecuted, for they set at\r\nnought the wisdom of the world and the customs and laws of ages. They\r\nshocked all conservative minds; all rulers and dignitaries; all men\r\nattached to systems; all syllogistic reasoners and dialectical\r\ntheologians; all fashionable and worldly people; all sects and parties\r\nattached to creeds and forms. Neither their inoffensive lives, nor\r\ntheir doctrine of non-resistance, nor their elevated spiritualism\r\ncould screen them from the wrath of judges, bishops, and legislators.\r\nThey were imprisoned, fined, whipped, and lacerated without mercy. But\r\nthey endured their afflictions with patience, and never lost their\r\nfaith in truth, or their trust in God. Generally, they belonged to the\r\nhumbler classes, although some men illustrious for birth and wealth\r\njoined their persecuted ranks, the most influential of whom was\r\nWilliam Penn, who lived to be their intercessor and protector, and the\r\nglorious founder and legislator of one of the most flourishing and\r\nvirtuous colonies that, in those days of tribulation, settled in the\r\nwilderness of North America; a colony of men who were true to their\r\nenlightened principles, and who were saved from the murderous tomahawk\r\nof the Indian, when all other settlements were scenes of cruelty and\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\nJames had now suppressed rebellion; he had filled the Dissenters with\r\nfear; and he met with no resistance from his parliaments. The judges\r\nand the bishops were ready to co\xc3\xb6perate with his ministers in imposing\r\na despotic yoke. All officers of the crown were dismissed the moment\r\nthey dissented from his policy, or protested against his acts. Even\r\njudges were removed to make way for the most unscrupulous of tools.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Despotic Power of James.]\r\n\r\nHis power, to all appearance, was consolidated; and he now began,\r\nwithout disguise, to advance the two great objects which were dearest\r\nto his heart--the restoration of the Catholic religion, and the\r\nimposition of a despotic yoke. He wished to be, like Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., a\r\ndespotic and absolute prince; and, to secure this end, he was ready to\r\nviolate the constitution of his country. The three inglorious years of\r\nhis reign were a succession of encroachments and usurpations.\r\n\r\nIndeed, among his first acts was the collection of the revenue without\r\nan act of parliament. To cover this stretch of arbitrary power, the\r\ncourt procured addresses from public bodies, in which the king was\r\nthanked for the royal care he extended to the customs and excise.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect the Catholics, who had been persecuted under the\r\nlast reign, he was obliged to show regard to other persecuted bodies.\r\nSo he issued a warrant, releasing from confinement all who were\r\nimprisoned for conscience\' sake. Had he simply desired universal\r\ntoleration, this act would merit our highest praises; but it was soon\r\nevident that he wished to elevate the Catholics at the expense of all\r\nthe rest. James was a sincere but bigoted devotee to the Church of\r\nRome, and all things were deemed lawful, if he could but advance the\r\ninterests of a party, to which nearly the whole nation was bitterly\r\nopposed. Roman Catholics were proscribed by the laws. The Test Act\r\nexcluded from civil and military office all who dissented from the\r\nEstablished Church. The laws were unjust, but still they were the laws\r\nwhich James had sworn to obey. Had he scrupulously observed them, and\r\nkept his faith, there can be no doubt that they would, in good time\r\nhave been modified.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Favor Extended to Catholics.]\r\n\r\nBut James would not wait for constitutional measures. He resolved to\r\nelevate Catholics to the highest offices of both the state and the\r\nchurch, and this in defiance of the laws and of the wishes of a great\r\nmajority of the nation. He accordingly gave commissions to Catholics\r\nto serve as officers in the army; he made Catholics his confidential\r\nadvisers; he introduced Jesuits into London; he received a Papal\r\nnuncio, and he offered the livings of the Church of England to needy\r\nCatholic adventurers. He sought, by threats and artifices, to secure\r\nthe repeal of the Test Act, by which Catholics were excluded from\r\noffice. Halifax, the ablest of his ministers, remonstrated, and he was\r\nturned out of his employments. But he formed the soul and the centre\r\nof an opposition, which finally drove the king from his throne. He\r\nunited with Devonshire and other Whig nobles, and their influence was\r\nsufficient to defeat many cherished objects of the king. When\r\nopposition appeared, however, in parliament, it was prorogued or\r\ndissolved, and the old courses of the Stuart kings were resorted to.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: High Commission Court.]\r\n\r\nAmong his various acts of infringement, which gave great scandal, even\r\nin those degenerate times, was the abuse of the dispensing power--a\r\nprerogative he had inherited, but which had never been strictly\r\ndefined. By means of this, he intended to admit Catholics to all\r\noffices in the realm. He began by granting to the whole Roman Catholic\r\nbody a dispensation from all the statutes which imposed penalties and\r\ntests. A general indulgence was proclaimed, and the courts of law were\r\ncompelled to acknowledge that the right of dispensing had not been\r\ninfringed. Four of the judges refused to accede to what was plainly\r\nillegal. They were dismissed; for, at that time, even judges held\r\noffice during the pleasure of the king, and not, as in these times,\r\nfor life. They had not the independence which has ever been so\r\nrequisite for the bench. Nor would all his counsellors and ministers\r\naccede to his design, and those who were refractory were turned out.\r\nAs soon as a servile bench of judges recognized this outrage on the\r\nconstitution, four Catholic noblemen were admitted as privy\r\ncounsellors, and some clergymen, converted to Romanism, were permitted\r\nto hold their livings. James even bestowed the deanery of Christ\r\nChurch, one of the highest dignities in the University of Oxford, on a\r\nnotorious Catholic, and threatened to do at Cambridge what had been\r\ndone at Oxford. The bishopric of Oxford was bestowed upon Parker, who\r\nwas more Catholic than Protestant, and that of Chester was given to a\r\nsycophant of no character. James made no secret of his intentions to\r\nrestore the Catholic religion, and systematically labored to destroy\r\nthe Established Church. In order to effect this, he created a\r\ntribunal, which not materially differed from the celebrated High\r\nCommission Court of Elizabeth, and to break up which was one great\r\nobject of the revolutionists who brought Charles\xc2\xa0I. to the block--the\r\nmost odious court ever established by royal despotism in England. The\r\nmembers of this High Commission Court, which James instituted to try\r\nall ecclesiastical cases, were, with one or two exceptions,\r\nnotoriously the most venal and tyrannical of all his agents--Jeffreys,\r\nthe Chancellor; Crewe, Bishop of Durham; Sprat, Bishop of Rochester;\r\nthe Earl of Rochester, Lord Treasurer; Sunderland, the Lord President;\r\nand Herbert, Chief Justice of the King\'s Bench. This court summoned\r\nCompton, the Bishop of London, to its tribunal, because he had not\r\nsuspended Dr. Sharp, one of the clergy of London, when requested to do\r\nso by the king--a man who had committed no crime, but simply\r\ndischarged his duty with fidelity. The bishop was suspended from his\r\nspiritual functions, and the charge of his diocese was committed to\r\ntwo of his judges. But this court, not content with depriving numerous\r\nclergymen of their spiritual functions, because they would not betray\r\ntheir own church, went so far as to sit in judgment on the two\r\ngreatest corporations in the land,--the Universities of Oxford and\r\nCambridge,--institutions which had ever befriended the Stuart kings in\r\ntheir crimes and misfortunes. James was infatuated enough to quarrel\r\nwith these great bodies, because they would not approve of his\r\nmeasures to overturn the church with which they were connected, and\r\nwhich it was their duty and interest to uphold. The king had commanded\r\nCambridge to bestow the degree of master of arts on a Benedictine\r\nmonk, which was against the laws of the University and of parliament.\r\nThe University refused to act against the law, and, in consequence,\r\nthe vice-chancellor and the senate, which consisted of doctors and\r\nmasters, were summoned to the Court of High Commission. The\r\nvice-chancellor, Pechell, was deprived of his office and emoluments,\r\nwhich were of the nature of freehold property. But this was not the\r\nworst act of the infatuated monarch. He insisted on imposing a Roman\r\nCatholic in the presidential chair of Magdalen College, one of the\r\nrichest and most venerable of the University of Oxford, against even\r\nthe friendly remonstrances of his best friends, even of his Catholic\r\ncounsellors, and not only against the advice of his friends, but\r\nagainst all the laws of the land and of the rights of the University;\r\nfor the proposed president, Farmer, was a Catholic, and was not a\r\nfellow of the college, and therefore especially disqualified. He was\r\nalso a man of depraved morals. The fellows refused to elect Farmer,\r\nand chose John Hough instead. They were accordingly cited to the\r\ninfamous court of which Jeffreys was the presiding and controlling\r\ngenius. Their election was set aside, but Farmer was not confirmed,\r\nbeing too vile even for Jeffreys to sustain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quarrel with the Universities.]\r\n\r\nThe king was exceedingly enraged at the opposition he received from\r\nthe University. He resolved to visit it. On his arrival, he summoned\r\nthe fellows of Magdalen College, and commanded them to obey him in the\r\nmatter of a president. They still held out in opposition, and the\r\nking, mortified and enraged, quitted Oxford to resort to bolder\r\nmeasures. A special commission was instituted. Hough was forcibly\r\nejected, and the Bishop of Oxford installed, against the voice of all\r\nthe fellows but two. But the blinded king was not yet content. The\r\nfellows were expelled from the University by a royal edict, and the\r\nhigh commissioner pronounced the ejected fellows incapable of ever\r\nholding any church preferment.\r\n\r\nBut these severities were blunders, and produced a different effect\r\nfrom what was anticipated. The nation was indignant; the Universities\r\nlost all reverence; the clergy, in a body, were alienated; and the\r\nwhole aristocracy were filled with defiance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magdalen College.]\r\n\r\nBut the king, nevertheless, for a time, prevailed against all\r\nopposition; and, now that the fellows of Magdalen College were\r\nexpelled, he turned it into a Popish seminary, admitted in one day\r\ntwelve Roman Catholics as fellows, and appointed a Roman Catholic\r\nbishop to preside over them. This last insult was felt to the\r\nextremities of the kingdom; and bitter resentment took the place of\r\nformer loyalty. James was now regarded, by his old friends even, as a\r\ntyrant, and as a man destined to destruction. And, indeed, he seemed\r\nlike one completely infatuated, bent on the ruin of that church which\r\neven James\xc2\xa0I. and the other Stuart kings regarded as the surest and\r\nfirmest pillar of the throne.\r\n\r\nThe bishops of the English Church had in times past, as well as the\r\nUniversities, inculcated the doctrine of passive obedience; and\r\noppression must be very grievous indeed which would induce them to\r\noppose the royal will. But James had completely alienated them, and\r\nthey, reluctantly, at last, threw themselves into the ranks of\r\nopposition. Had they remained true to him, he might still have held\r\nhis sceptre; but it was impossible that any body of men could longer\r\nbear his injustice and tyranny.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prosecution of the Seven Bishops.]\r\n\r\nFrom motives as impossible to fathom, as it is difficult to account\r\nfor the actions of a madman, he ordered that the Declaration of\r\nIndulgence, an unconstitutional act, should be read publicly from all\r\nthe pulpits in the kingdom. The London clergy, the most respectable\r\nand influential in the realm, made up their minds to disregard the\r\norder, and the bishops sustained them in their refusal. The archbishop\r\nand six bishops accordingly signed a petition to the king, which\r\nembodied the views of the London clergy. It was presented to the\r\ntyrant, by the prelates in a body, at his palace. He chose to consider\r\nit as a treasonable and libellous act--as nothing short of rebellion.\r\nThe conduct of the prelates was generally and enthusiastically\r\napproved by the nation, and especially by the Dissenters, who now\r\nunited with the members of the Established Church. James had recently\r\ncourted the Dissenters, not wishing to oppose too many enemies at a\r\ntime. He had conferred on them many indulgences, and had elevated some\r\nof them to high positions, with the hope that they would unite with\r\nhim in breaking down the Establishment. But while some of the more\r\nfanatical were gained over, the great body were not so easily\r\ndeceived. They knew well enough that, after crushing the Church of\r\nEngland, he would crush them. And they hated Catholicism and tyranny\r\nmore than they did Episcopacy, in spite of their many persecutions.\r\nSome of the more eminent of the Dissenters took a noble stand, and\r\ntheir conduct was fully appreciated by the Established clergy. For the\r\nfirst time, since the accession of Elizabeth, the Dissenters and the\r\nEpiscopalians treated each other with that courtesy and forbearance\r\nwhich enlightened charity demands. The fear of a common enemy united\r\nthem. But time, also, had, at length, removed many of their mutual\r\nasperities.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the vexation of James when he found that not only\r\nthe clergy had disobeyed his orders, but that the Seven Bishops were\r\nsustained by the nation. When this was discovered, he should have\r\nyielded, as Elizabeth would have done. But he was a Stuart. He was a\r\nbigoted, and self-willed, and infatuated monarch, marked out most\r\nclearly by Providence for destruction. He resolved to prosecute the\r\nbishops for a libel, and their trial and acquittal are among the most\r\ninteresting events of an inglorious reign. They were tried at the\r\nCourt of the King\'s Bench. The most eminent lawyers in the realm were\r\nemployed as their counsel, and all the arts of tyranny were resorted\r\nto by the servile judges who tried them. But the jury rendered a\r\nverdict of acquittal, and never, within man\'s memory, were such shouts\r\nand tears of joy manifested by the people. Even the soldiers, whom the\r\nking had ordered to Hounslow Heath to overawe London, partook of the\r\nenthusiasm and triumph of the people. All classes were united in\r\nexpressions of joy that the tyrant for once was baffled. The king was\r\nindeed signally defeated; but his defeat did not teach him wisdom. It\r\nonly made him the more resolved to crush the liberties of the Church,\r\nand the liberties of the nation. But it also arrayed against him all\r\nclasses and all parties of Protestants, who now began to form\r\nalliances, and devise measures to hurl him from his throne. Even the\r\nvery courts which James had instituted to crush liberty proved\r\nrefractory. Sprat, the servile Bishop of Rochester, sent him his\r\nresignation as one of the Lord Commissioners. The very meanness of his\r\nspirit and laxity of his principles made his defection peculiarly\r\nalarming, and the unblushing Jeffreys now began to tremble. The Court\r\nof High Commission shrunk from a conflict with the Established Church,\r\nespecially when its odious character was loudly denounced by all\r\nclasses in the kingdom--even by some of the agents of tyranny itself.\r\nThe most unscrupulous slaves of power showed signs of uneasiness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tyranny and Infatuation of James.]\r\n\r\nBut James resolved to persevere. The sanction of a parliament was\r\nnecessary to his system, but the sanction of a free parliament it was\r\nimpossible to obtain. He resolved to bring together, by corruption and\r\nintimidation, by violent exertions of prerogative, by fraudulent\r\ndistortions of law, an assembly which might call itself a parliament,\r\nand might be willing to register any edict he proposed. And,\r\naccordingly, every placeman, from the highest to the lowest, was made\r\nto understand that he must support the throne or lose his office. He\r\nset himself vigorously to pack a parliament. A committee of seven\r\nprivy counsellors sat at Whitehall for the purpose of regulating the\r\nmunicipal corporations. Father Petre was made a privy councillor.\r\nCommittees, after the model of the one at Whitehall, were established\r\nin all parts of the realm. The lord lieutenants received written\r\norders to go down to their respective counties, and superintend the\r\nwork of corruption and fraud. But half of them refused to perform the\r\nignominious work, and were immediately dismissed from their posts,\r\nwhich were posts of great honor and consideration. Among these were\r\nthe great Earls of Oxford, Shrewsbury, Dorset, Pembroke, Rutland,\r\nBridgewater, Thanet, Northampton, Abingdon, and Gainsborough, whose\r\nfamilies were of high antiquity, wealth, and political influence. Nor\r\ncould those nobles, who consented to conform to the wishes and orders\r\nof the king, make any progress in their counties, on account of the\r\ngeneral opposition of the gentry. The county squires, as a body, stood\r\nout in fierce resistance. They refused to send up any men to\r\nparliament who would vote away the liberties and interests of the\r\nnation. The justices and deputy lieutenants declared that they would\r\nsustain, at all hazard, the Protestant religion. And these persons\r\nwere not odious republicans, but zealous royalists, now firmly united\r\nand resolved to oppose unlawful acts, though commanded by the king.\r\n\r\nJames and his ministers next resolved to take away the power of the\r\nmunicipal corporations. The boroughs were required to surrender their\r\ncharters. But a great majority firmly refused to part with their\r\nprivileges. They were prosecuted and intimidated, but still they held\r\nout. Oxford, by a vote of eighty to two, voted to defend its\r\nfranchises. Other towns did the same. Meanwhile, all the public\r\ndepartments were subjected to a strict inquisition, and all, who would\r\nnot support the policy of the king, were turned out of office, and\r\namong them were some who had been heretofore the zealous servants of\r\nthe crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Organized Opposition.]\r\n\r\nIt was now full time for the organization of a powerful confederacy\r\nagainst the king. It was obvious, to men of all parties, and all\r\nranks, that he meditated the complete subversion of English liberties.\r\nThe fundamental laws of the kingdom had been systematically violated.\r\nThe power of dispensing with acts of parliament had been strained, so\r\nthat the king had usurped nearly all legislative authority. The courts\r\nof justice had been filled with unscrupulous judges, who were ready to\r\nobey all the king\'s injunctions, whether legal or illegal. Roman\r\nCatholics had been elevated to places of dignity in the Established\r\nChurch. An infamous and tyrannical Court of High Commission had been\r\ncreated; persons, who could not legally set foot in England, had been\r\nplaced at the head of colleges, and had taken their seat at the royal\r\ncouncil-board. Lord lieutenants of counties, and other servants of the\r\ncrown, had been dismissed for refusing to obey illegal commands; the\r\nfranchises of almost every borough had been invaded; the courts of\r\njustice were venal and corrupt; an army of Irish Catholics, whom the\r\nnation abhorred, had been brought over to England; even the sacred\r\nright of petition was disregarded, and respectful petitioners were\r\ntreated as criminals; and a free parliament was prevented from\r\nassembling.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, and in view of these unquestioned facts, a\r\ngreat conspiracy was set on foot to dethrone the king and overturn the\r\nhateful dynasty.\r\n\r\nAmong the conspirators were some of the English nobles, the chief of\r\nwhom was the Earl of Devonshire, and one of the leaders of the Whig\r\nparty. Shrewsbury and Danby also joined them, the latter nobleman\r\nhaving been one of the most zealous advocates of the doctrine of\r\npassive obedience which many of the High Churchmen and Tories had\r\ndefended in the reign of Charles\xc2\xa0II. It was under his administration,\r\nas prime minister, that a law had been proposed to parliament to\r\nexclude all persons from office who refused to take an oath, declaring\r\nthat they thought resistance in all cases unlawful. Compton, the\r\nBishop of London, who had been insolently treated by the court, joined\r\nthe conspirators, whose designs were communicated to the Prince of\r\nOrange by Edward Russell and Henry Sydney, brothers of those two great\r\npolitical martyrs who had been executed in the last reign. The Prince\r\nof Orange, who had married a daughter of James\xc2\xa0II., agreed to invade\r\nEngland with a well-appointed army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William, Prince of Orange.]\r\n\r\nWilliam of Orange was doubtless the greatest statesman and warrior of\r\nhis age, and one of the ablest men who ever wore a crown. He was at\r\nthe head of the great Protestant party in Europe, and was the\r\ninveterate foe of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. When a youth, his country had been\r\ninvaded by Louis, and desolated and abandoned to pillage and cruelty.\r\nIt was amid unexampled calamities, when the population were every\r\nwhere flying before triumphant armies, and the dikes of Holland had\r\nbeen opened for the ravages of the sea in order to avoid the more\r\ncruel ravages of war, that William was called to be at the head of\r\naffairs. He had scarcely emerged from boyhood; but his boyhood was\r\npassed in scenes of danger and trial, and his extraordinary talents\r\nwere most precociously developed. His tastes were warlike; but he was\r\na warrior who fought, not for the love of fighting, not for military\r\nglory, but to rescue his country from a degrading yoke, and to secure\r\nthe liberties of Europe from the encroachments of a most ambitious\r\nmonarch. Zeal for those liberties was the animating principle of his\r\nexistence; and this led him to oppose so perseveringly the policy and\r\nenterprises of the French king, even to the disadvantage of his native\r\ncountry and the country which adopted him.\r\n\r\nWilliam was ambitious, and did not disdain the overtures which the\r\ndiscontented nobles of England made to him. Besides, his wife, the\r\nPrincess Mary, was presumptive heir to the crown before the birth of\r\nthe Prince of Wales. The eyes of the English nation had long been\r\nfixed upon him as their deliverer from the tyranny of James. He was a\r\nsincere Protestant, a bold and enterprising genius, and a consummate\r\nstatesman. But he delayed taking any decisive measures until affairs\r\nwere ripe for his projects--until the misgovernment and encroachments\r\nof James drove the nation to the borders of frenzy. He then obtained\r\nthe consent of the States General for the meditated invasion of\r\nEngland, and made immense preparations, which, however, were carefully\r\nconcealed from the spies and agents of James. They did not escape,\r\nhowever, the scrutinizing and jealous eye of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., who\r\nremonstrated with James on his blindness and self-confidence, and\r\noffered to lend him assistance. But the infatuated monarch would not\r\nbelieve his danger, and rejected the proffered aid of Louis with a\r\nspirit which ill accorded with his former servility and dependence.\r\nNor was he aroused to a sense of his danger until the Declaration of\r\nWilliam appeared, setting forth the tyrannical acts of James, and\r\nsupposed to be written by Bishop Burnet, the intimate friend of the\r\nPrince of Orange. Then he made haste to fit out a fleet; and thirty\r\nships of the line were put under the command of Lord Dartmouth. An\r\narmy of forty thousand men--the largest that any king of England had\r\never commanded--was also sent to the seaboard; a force more than\r\nsufficient to repel a Dutch invasion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Critical Condition of James.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the king made great concessions. He abolished the\r\nCourt of High Commission. He restored the charter of the city of\r\nLondon. He permitted the Bishop of Winchester, as visitor of Magdalen\r\nCollege, to make any reforms he pleased. He would not, however, part\r\nwith an iota of his dispensing power, and still hoped to rout William,\r\nand change the religion of his country. But all his concessions were\r\ntoo late. Whigs and Tories, Dissenters and Churchmen, were ready to\r\nwelcome their Dutch deliverer. Nor had James any friends on whom he\r\ncould rely. His prime minister, Sunderland, was in treaty with the\r\nconspirators, and waiting to betray him. Churchill, who held one of\r\nthe highest commissions in the army, and who was under great\r\nobligations to the king, was ready to join the standard of William.\r\nJeffreys, the lord chancellor, was indeed true in his allegiance, but\r\nhis crimes were past all forgiveness by the nation; and even had he\r\nrebelled,--and he was base enough to do so,--his services would have\r\nbeen spurned by William and all his adherents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Invasion of England by William.]\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of October, 1688, the armament of William put to sea; but\r\nthe ships had scarcely gained half the distance to England when they\r\nwere dispersed and driven back to Holland by a violent tempest. The\r\nhopes of James revived; but they were soon dissipated. The fleet of\r\nWilliam, on the 1st of November, again put to sea. It was composed of\r\nmore than six hundred vessels, five hundred of which were men of war,\r\nand they were favored by auspicious gales. The same winds which\r\nfavored the Dutch ships retarded the fleet of Dartmouth. On the 5th of\r\nNovember, the troops of William disembarked at Brixham, near Torbay in\r\nDevonshire, without opposition. On the 6th, he advanced to Newton\r\nAbbot, and, on the 9th, reached Exeter. He was cordially received, and\r\nmagnificently entertained. He and his lieutenant-general, Marshal\r\nSchomberg, one of the greatest commanders in Europe, entered Exeter\r\ntogether in the grand military procession, which was like a Roman\r\ntriumph. Near him also was Bentinck, his intimate friend and\r\ncounsellor, the founder of a great ducal family. The procession\r\nmarched to the splendid Cathedral, the _Te Deum_ was sung, and Burnet\r\npreached a sermon.\r\n\r\nThus far all things had been favorable, and William was fairly\r\nestablished on English ground. Still his affairs were precarious, and\r\nJames\'s condition not utterly hopeless or desperate. In spite of the\r\nunpopularity of the king, his numerous encroachments, and his\r\ndisaffected army, the enterprise of William was hazardous. He was an\r\ninvader, and the slightest repulse would have been dangerous to his\r\ninterests. James was yet a king, and had the control of the army, the\r\nnavy, and the treasury. He was a legitimate king, whose claims were\r\nundisputed. And he was the father of a son, and that son,\r\nnotwithstanding the efforts of the Protestants to represent him as a\r\nfalse heir, was indeed the Prince of Wales. William had no claim to\r\nthe throne so long as that prince was living. Nor had the nobles and\r\ngentry flocked to his standard as he had anticipated. It was nearly a\r\nweek before a single person of rank or consequence joined him.\r\nDevonshire was in Derbyshire, and Churchill had still the confidence\r\nof his sovereign. The forces of the king were greatly superior to his\r\nown. And James had it in his power to make concessions which would\r\nhave satisfied a great part of the nation.\r\n\r\nBut William had not miscalculated. He had profoundly studied the\r\ncharacter of James, and the temper of the English. He knew that a\r\nfatal blindness and obstinacy had been sent upon him, and that he\r\nnever would relinquish his darling scheme of changing the religion of\r\nthe nation; and he knew that the nation would never acquiesce in that\r\nchange; that Popery was hateful in their sight. He also trusted to his\r\nown good sword, and to fortunate circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of the King.]\r\n\r\nAnd he was not long doomed to suspense, which is generally so\r\ndifficult to bear. In a few days, Lord Cornbury, colonel of a\r\nregiment, and son of the Earl of Clarendon, and therefore a relative\r\nof James himself, deserted. Soon several disaffected nobles joined him\r\nin Exeter. Churchill soon followed, the first general officer that\r\never in England abandoned his colors. The Earl of Bath, who commanded\r\nat Plymouth, placed himself, in a few days, at the prince\'s disposal,\r\nwith the fortress which he was intrusted to guard. His army swelled in\r\nnumbers and importance. Devonshire raised the standard of rebellion at\r\nChatsworth. London was in a ferment. James was with his army at\r\nSalisbury, but gave the order to retreat, not daring to face the\r\ngreatest captain in Europe. Soon after, he sent away the queen and the\r\nPrince of Wales to France, and made preparations for his own\r\nignominious flight--the very thing his enemies desired, for his life\r\nwas in no danger, and his affairs even then might have been\r\ncompromised, in spite of the rapid defection of his friends, and the\r\nadvance of William, with daily augmenting forces, upon London. On the\r\n11th of December, the king fled from London, with the intention of\r\nembarking at Sheerness, and was detained by the fishermen of the\r\ncoast; but, by an order from the Lords, was set at liberty, and\r\nreturned to the capital. William, nearly at the same time, reached\r\nLondon, and took up his quarters at St. James\'s Palace. It is needless\r\nto add, that the population of the city were friendly to his cause,\r\nand that he was now virtually the king of England. It is a\r\nsatisfaction also to add, that the most infamous instrument of royal\r\ntyranny was seized in the act of flight, at Wapping, in the mean\r\ndisguise of a sailor. He was discovered by the horrible fierceness of\r\nhis countenance. Jeffreys was committed to the Tower; and the Tower\r\nscreened him from a worse calamity, for the mob would have torn him in\r\npieces. Catholic priests were also arrested, and their chapels and\r\nhouses destroyed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile parliament assembled and deliberated on the state of\r\naffairs. Many propositions were made and rejected. The king fled a\r\nsecond time, and the throne was declared vacant. But the crown was not\r\nimmediately offered to the Prince of Orange, although addresses were\r\nmade to him as a national benefactor. Many were in favor of a regency.\r\nAnother party was for placing the Princess Mary on the throne, and\r\ngiving to William, during her life, the title of king, and such a\r\nshare of the administration as she chose to give him.\r\n\r\nBut William had risked every thing for a throne, and nothing less than\r\nthe crown of England would now content him. He gave the convention to\r\nunderstand that, much as he esteemed his wife, he would never accept a\r\nsubordinate and precarious place in her government; "that he would not\r\nsubmit to be tied to the apron-strings of the best of wives;" that,\r\nunless he were offered the crown for life, he should return to\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nIt was accordingly settled by parliament that he should hold the regal\r\ndignity conjointly with his wife, but that the whole power of the\r\ngovernment should be placed in his hands. And the Princess Mary\r\nwillingly acceded, being devoted to her husband, and unambitious for\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consummation of the Revolution.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Declaration of Rights.]\r\n\r\nThus was consummated the English Revolution of 1688, bloodless, but\r\nglorious. A tyrant was ejected from an absolute throne, and a noble\r\nand magnanimous prince reigned in his stead, after having taken an\r\noath to observe the laws of the realm--an oath which he never\r\nviolated. Of all revolutions, this proved the most beneficent. It\r\nclosed the long struggle of one hundred and fifty years. Royal\r\nprerogative bowed before the will of the people, and true religious\r\nand civil liberty commenced its reign. The Prince of Orange was called\r\nto the throne by the voice of the nation, as set forth in an\r\ninstrument known as the Declaration of Rights. This celebrated act of\r\nsettlement recapitulated the crimes and errors of James, and merely\r\nasserted the ancient rights and liberties of England--that the\r\ndispensing power had no legal existence; that no money could be raised\r\nwithout grant of parliament; and that no army could be kept up in time\r\nof peace without its consent; and it also asserted the right of\r\npetition, the right of electors to choose their representatives\r\nfreely, the right of parliament to freedom of debate, and the right of\r\nthe nation to a pure and merciful administration of justice. No new\r\nrights were put forth, but simply the old ones were re\xc3\xabstablished.\r\nWilliam accepted the crown on the conditions proposed, and swore to\r\nrule by the laws. "Not a single flower of the crown," says Macaulay,\r\n"was touched. Not a single new right was given to the people. The\r\nDeclaration of Rights, although it made nothing law which was not law\r\nbefore, contained the germ of the law which gave religious freedom to\r\nthe Dissenters; of the law which secured the independence of judges;\r\nof the law which limited the duration of parliaments; of the law which\r\nplaced the liberty of the press under the protection of juries; of the\r\nlaw which abolished the sacramental test; of the law which relieved\r\nthe Roman Catholics from civil disabilities; of the law which reformed\r\nthe representative system; of every good law which has been passed\r\nduring one hundred and sixty years; of every good law which may\r\nhereafter, in the course of ages, be found necessary to promote the\r\npublic weal, and satisfy the demands of public opinion."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Macaulay\'s, Hume\'s, Hallam\'s, and Lingard\'s\r\n     Histories of England.

Indeed, his reign forms an\r\nepoch of itself, not so much from any impulse he gave to liberty or\r\ncivilization, but because, for more than half a century, he was the\r\ncentral mover of European politics. His reign commemorates the triumph\r\nin France, of despotic principles, the complete suppression of popular\r\ninterests, and almost the absorption of national interests in his own\r\npersonal aggrandizement. It commemorates the ascendency of fashion,\r\nand the great refinement of material life. The camp and the court of\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XIV. ingulphed all that is interesting in the history of France\r\nduring the greater part of the seventeenth century. He reigned\r\nseventy-two years, and, in his various wars, a million of men are\r\nsupposed to have fallen victims to his vain-glorious ambition. His\r\npalaces consumed the treasures which his wars spared. He was viewed as\r\na sun of glory and power, in the light of which all other lights were\r\ndim. Philosophers, poets, prelates, generals, and statesmen, during\r\nhis reign, were regarded only as his satellites. He was the central\r\norb around which every other light revolved, and to contribute to his\r\nglory all were supposed to be born. He was, most emphatically, the\r\nstate. He was France. A man, therefore, who, in the eye of\r\ncontemporaries, was so grand, so rich, so powerful, and so absolute,\r\nclaims a special notice. It is the province of history to record great\r\ninfluences, whether they come from the people, from great popular\r\nideas, from literature and science, or from a single man. The lives of\r\nindividuals are comparatively insignificant in the history of the\r\nUnited States; but the lives of such men as C\xc3\xa6sar, Cromwell, and\r\nNapoleon, furnish very great subjects for the pen of the philosophical\r\nhistorian, since great controlling influences emanated from them,\r\nrather than from the people whom they ruled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Power and Resources.]\r\n\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XIV. was not a great general, like Henry\xc2\xa0IV., nor a great\r\nstatesman, like William\xc2\xa0III., nor a philosopher, like Frederic the\r\nGreat, nor a universal genius, like Napoleon; but his reign filled the\r\neyes of contemporaries, and circumstances combined to make him the\r\nabsolute master of a great empire. Moreover, he had sufficient talent\r\nand ambition to make use of fortunate opportunities, and of the\r\nresources of his kingdom, for his own aggrandizement. But France,\r\nnevertheless, was sacrificed. The French Revolution was as much the\r\neffect of his vanity and egotism, as his own power was the fruit of\r\nthe policy of Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin. By their labors in the\r\ncause of absolutism, he came in possession of armies and treasures.\r\nBut armies and treasures were expended in objects of vain ambition,\r\nfor the gratification of selfish pleasures, for expensive pageants,\r\nand for gorgeous palaces. These finally embarrassed the nation, and\r\nground it down to the earth by the load of taxation, and maddened it\r\nby the prospect of ruin, by the poverty and degradation of the people,\r\nand, at the same time, by the extravagance and insolence of an\r\noverbearing aristocracy. The aristocracy formed the glory and pride of\r\nthe throne and both nobles and the throne fell, and great was the fall\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nOur notice of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. begins, not with his birth, but at the time\r\nwhen he resolved to be his own prime minister, on the death of\r\nCardinal Mazarin, (1661.)\r\n\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XIV. was then twenty-three years of age--frank, beautiful,\r\nimperious, and ambitious. His education had been neglected, but his\r\npride and selfishness had been stimulated. During his minority, he had\r\nbeen straitened for money by the avaricious cardinal; but avaricious\r\nfor his youthful master, since, at his death, besides his private\r\nfortune, which amounted to two hundred millions of livres, he left\r\nfifteen millions of livres, not specified in his will, which, of\r\ncourse, the king seized, and thus became the richest monarch of\r\nEurope. He was married, shortly before the death of Mazarin, to the\r\nInfanta Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip\xc2\xa0IV., King of Spain. But,\r\nlong before his marriage, he had become attached to Mary de Mancini,\r\nniece of Mazarin, who returned his love with passionate ardor. She\r\nafterwards married Prince Colonna, a Roman noble, and lived a most\r\nabandoned life.\r\n\r\nThe enormous wealth left by Cardinal Mazarin was, doubtless, one\r\nmotive which induced Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., though only a young man of\r\ntwenty-three, to be his own prime minister. Henceforth, to his death,\r\nall his ministers made their regular reports to him, and none were\r\npermitted to go beyond the limits which he prescribed to them.\r\n\r\nHe accepted, at first, the ministers whom the dying cardinal had\r\nrecommended. The most prominent of these were Le Tellier, De Lionne,\r\nand Fouquet. The last was intrusted with the public chest, who found\r\nthe means to supply the dissipated young monarch with all the money he\r\ndesired for the indulgence of his expensive tastes and ruinous\r\npleasures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Habits and Pleasures of Louis.]\r\n\r\nThe thoughts and time of the king, from the death of Mazarin, for six\r\nor seven years, were chiefly occupied with his pleasures. It was then\r\nthat the court of France was so debauched, splendid, and far-famed. It\r\nwas during this time that the king was ruled by La Valli\xc3\xa8re, one of\r\nthe most noted of all his favorites, a woman of considerable beauty\r\nand taste, and not so unprincipled as royal favorites generally have\r\nbeen. She was created a duchess, and her children were legitimatized,\r\nand also became dukes and princes. Of these the king was very fond,\r\nand his love for them survived the love for their unfortunate mother,\r\nwho, though beautiful and affectionate, was not sufficiently\r\nintellectual to retain the affections with which she inspired the most\r\nselfish monarch of his age. She was supplanted in the king\'s\r\naffections by Madame de Montespan, an imperious beauty, whose\r\nextravagances and follies shocked and astonished even the most\r\nlicentious court in Europe; and La Valli\xc3\xa8re, broken-hearted,\r\ndisconsolate, and mortified, sought the shelter of a Carmelite\r\nconvent, in which she dragged out thirty-six melancholy and dreary\r\nyears, amid the most rigorous severities of self-inflicted penance, in\r\nthe anxious hope of that heavenly mansion where her sins would be no\r\nlonger remembered, and where the weary would be at rest.\r\n\r\nIt was during these years of extravagance and pleasure that Versailles\r\nattracted the admiring gaze of Christendom, the most gorgeous palace\r\nwhich the world has seen since the fall of Babylon. Amid its gardens\r\nand groves, its parks and marble halls, did the modern Nebuchadnezzar\r\nrevel in a pomp and grandeur unparalleled in the history of Europe,\r\nsurrounded by eminent prelates, poets, philosophers, and statesmen,\r\nand all that rank and beauty had ennobled throughout his vast\r\ndominions. Intoxicated by their united flatteries, by all the incense\r\nwhich sycophancy, carried to a science, could burn before him, he\r\nalmost fancied himself a deity, and gave no bounds to his\r\nself-indulgence, his vanity, and his pride. Every thing was\r\nsubordinate to his pleasure and his egotism--an egotism alike\r\nregardless of the tears of discarded favorites, and the groans of his\r\noverburdened subjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Military Ambition.]\r\n\r\nBut Louis, at last, palled with pleasure, was aroused from the\r\nfestivities of Versailles by dreams of military ambition. He knew\r\nnothing of war, of its dangers, its reverses, or of its ruinous\r\nexpenses; but he fancied it would be a beautiful sport for a wealthy\r\nand absolute monarch to engage in the costly game. He cast his eyes on\r\nHolland, a state extremely weak in land forces, and resolved to add it\r\nto the great kingdom over which he ruled.\r\n\r\nThe only power capable of rendering effectual assistance to Holland,\r\nwhen menaced by Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., was England; but England was ruled by\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0II., and all he cared for were his pleasures and independence\r\nfrom parliamentary control. The French king easily induced him to\r\nbreak his alliance with the Dutch by a timely bribe, while, at the\r\nsame time, he insured the neutrality of Spain, by inflaming the\r\nhereditary prejudices of the Spanish court against the Low Countries.\r\n\r\nWar, therefore, without even a decent pretence, and without\r\nprovocation, was declared against Holland, with a view of annexing the\r\nLow Countries to France.\r\n\r\nBefore the Dutch were able to prepare for resistance, Louis\xc2\xa0XIV.\r\nappeared on the banks of the Rhine with an army of one hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand, marshalled by such able generals as Luxembourg,\r\nCond\xc3\xa9, and Turenne. The king commanded in person, and with all the\r\npomp of an ancient Persian monarch, surrounded with women and nobles.\r\nWithout any adequate force to resist him, his march could not but be\r\ntriumphant. He crossed the Rhine,--an exploit much celebrated, by his\r\nflatterers, though nothing at all extraordinary,--and, in the course\r\nof a few weeks, nearly all the United Provinces had surrendered to the\r\nroyal victor. The reduction of Holland and Zealand alone was necessary\r\nto crown his enterprise with complete success. But he wasted time in\r\nvain parade at Utrecht, where he held his court, and where his\r\nsplendid army revelled in pleasure and pomp. Amsterdam alone, amid the\r\ngeneral despondency and consternation which the French inundation\r\nproduced, was true to herself, and to the liberties of Holland; and\r\nthis was chiefly by means of the gallant efforts of the Prince of\r\nOrange.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William, Prince of Orange.]\r\n\r\nAt this time, (1672,) he was twenty-two years of age, and had received\r\nan excellent education, and shown considerable military abilities. In\r\nconsequence of his precocity of talent, his unquestioned patriotism,\r\nand the great services which his family had rendered to the state, he\r\nwas appointed commander-in-chief of the forces of the republic, and\r\nwas encouraged to aspire to the office of stadtholder, the highest in\r\nthe commonwealth. And his power was much increased after the massacre\r\nof the De Witts--the innocent victims of popular jealousy, who, though\r\npatriotic and illustrious, inclined to a different policy than what\r\nthe Orange party advocated. William advised the States to reject with\r\nscorn the humiliating terms of peace which Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. offered, and to\r\nmake any sacrifice in defence of their very last ditch. The heroic\r\nspirit which animated his bosom he communicated to his countrymen, on\r\nthe borders of despair, and in the prospect of national ruin; and so\r\ngreat was the popular enthusiasm, that preparations were made for\r\nfifty thousand families to fly to the Dutch possessions in the East\r\nIndies, and establish there a new empire, in case they were\r\noverwhelmed by their triumphant enemy.\r\n\r\nNever, in the history of war, were such energies put forth as by the\r\nHollanders in the hour of their extremity. They opened their dikes,\r\nand overflowed their villages and their farms. They rallied around the\r\nstandard of their heroic leader, who, with twenty-two thousand men,\r\nkept the vast armies of Cond\xc3\xa9 and Turenne at bay. Providence, too,\r\nassisted men who were willing to help themselves. The fleets of their\r\nenemies were dispersed by storms, and their armies were driven back by\r\nthe timely inundation.\r\n\r\nThe heroism of William called forth universal admiration. Louis\r\nattempted to bribe him, and offered him the sovereignty of Holland,\r\nwhich offer he unhesitatingly rejected. He had seen the lowest point\r\nin the depression of his country, and was confident of ultimate\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of Holland was unexpected, and Louis, wearied with the\r\ncampaign, retired to Versailles, to be fed with the incense of his\r\nflatterers, and to publish the manifestoes of his glory and success.\r\n\r\nThe states of Europe, jealous of the encroachments of Louis, at last\r\nresolved to come to the assistance of the struggling republic of\r\nHolland. Charles\xc2\xa0II. ingloriously sided with the great despot of\r\nEurope; but the Emperor of Germany, the Elector of Brandenburg, and\r\nthe King of Spain declared war against France. Moreover, the Dutch\r\ngained some signal naval battles. The celebrated admirals De Ruyter\r\nand Van Tromp redeemed the ancient glories of the Dutch flag. The\r\nFrench were nearly driven out of Holland; and Charles\xc2\xa0II., in spite of\r\nhis secret treaties with Louis, was compelled to make peace with the\r\nlittle state which had hitherto defied him in the plenitude of his\r\npower.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second Invasion of Holland.]\r\n\r\nBut the ambitious King of France was determined not to be baffled in\r\nhis scheme, since he had all the mighty resources of his kingdom at\r\nhis entire disposal, and was burning with the passion of military\r\naggrandizement. So he recommenced preparations for the conquest of\r\nHolland on a greater scale than ever, and assembled four immense\r\narmies. Cond\xc3\xa9 led one against Flanders, and fought a bloody but\r\nindecisive battle with the Prince of Orange, in which twelve thousand\r\nmen were killed on each side. Turenne commanded another on the side of\r\nGermany, and possessed himself of the Palatinate, gained several\r\nbrilliant successes, but disgraced them by needless cruelties.\r\nManheim, and numerous towns and villages, were burnt, and the country\r\nlaid waste and desolate. The elector was so overcome with indignation,\r\nthat he challenged the French general to single combat, which the\r\ngreat marshal declined.\r\n\r\nLouis himself headed a third army, and invaded Franche Comt\xc3\xa9, which he\r\nsubdued in six weeks. The fourth army was sent to the frontiers of\r\nRoussillon, but effected nothing of importance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dutch War.]\r\n\r\nThis great war was prosecuted for four years longer, in which the\r\ncontending parties obtained various success. The only decisive effect\r\nof the contest was to reduce the strength of all the contending\r\npowers. Some great battles were fought, but Holland still held out\r\nwith inferior forces. Louis lost the great Turenne, who was killed on\r\nthe eve of a battle with the celebrated Montecuculi, who commanded the\r\nGerman armies; but, in a succeeding campaign, this loss was\r\ncompensated by the surrender of Valenciennes, by the victories of\r\nLuxembourg over the Prince of Orange, and by another treaty of peace\r\nwith Charles\xc2\xa0II.\r\n\r\nAt last, all the contending parties were exhausted, and Louis was\r\nwilling to make terms of peace. He had not reduced Holland, but, on\r\naccount of his vast resources, he had obtained considerable\r\nadvantages. The treaty of Nimeguen, in 1678, secured to him Franche\r\nComt\xc3\xa9, which he had twice conquered, and several important cities and\r\nfortresses in Flanders. He considerably extended his dominions, in\r\nspite of a powerful confederacy, and only retreated from the field of\r\ntriumph to meditate more gigantic enterprises.\r\n\r\nFor nine years, Europe enjoyed a respite from the horrors of war,\r\nduring which Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. acted like a universal monarch. During these\r\nnine years, he indulged in his passion of palace building, and\r\nsurrounded himself with every pleasure which could intoxicate a mind\r\non which, already, had been exhausted all the arts of flattery, and\r\nall the resources of wealth.\r\n\r\nThe man to whom Louis was most indebted for the means to prosecute his\r\nvictories and build his palaces, was Colbert, minister of finance, who\r\nsucceeded Fouquet. France was indebted to this able and patriotic\r\nminister for her richest manufactures of silks, laces, tapestries, and\r\ncarpets, and for various internal improvements. He founded the Gobelin\r\ntapestries; erected the Royal Library, the colonnade of the Louvre,\r\nthe Royal Observatory, the Hotel of the Invalids, and the palaces of\r\nthe Tuileries, Vincennes, Meudon, and Versailles. He encouraged all\r\nforms of industry, and protected the Huguenots. But his great services\r\nwere not fully appreciated by the king, and he was obnoxious to the\r\nnobility, who envied his eminence, and to the people, because he\r\ndesired the prosperity of France more than the gratification of their\r\npleasures. He was succeeded by Louvois, who long retained a great\r\nascendency by obsequious attention to all the king\'s wishes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame Montespan.]\r\n\r\nAt this period, the reigning favorite at court was Madame de\r\nMontespan--the most infamous and unprincipled, but most witty and\r\nbrilliant of all the king\'s mistresses, and the haughtiest woman of\r\nher age. Her tastes were expensive, and her habits extravagant and\r\nluxurious. On her the sovereign showered diamonds and rubies. He could\r\nrefuse her nothing. She received so much from him, that she could\r\nafford to endow a convent--the mere building of which cost one million\r\neight hundred thousand livres. Her children were legitimatized, and\r\ndeclared princes of the blood. Through her the royal favors flowed.\r\nAmbassadors, ministers, and even prelates, paid their court to her. On\r\nher the reproofs of Bossuet fell without effect. Secure in her\r\nascendency over the mind of Louis, she triumphed over his court, and\r\ninsulted the nation. But, at last, he grew weary of her, although she\r\nremained at court eighteen years, and she was dismissed from\r\nVersailles, on a pension of a sum equal to six hundred thousand\r\ndollars a year. She lived twenty-two years after her exile from court,\r\nand in great splendor, sometimes hoping to regain the ascendency she\r\nhad once enjoyed, and at others in those rigorous penances which her\r\nchurch inflicts as the expiation for sin. To the last, however, she\r\nwas haughty and imperious, and kept up the vain etiquette of a court.\r\nHer husband, whom she had abandoned, and to whom, after her disgrace,\r\nshe sought to be reconciled, never would hear her name mentioned; and\r\nthe king, whom, for nearly twenty years, she had enthralled, heard of\r\nher death with indifference, as he was starting for a hunting\r\nexcursion. "Ah, indeed," said Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., "so the marchioness is dead!\r\nI should have thought that she would have lasted longer. Are you\r\nready, M. de la Rochefoucauld? I have no doubt that, after this last\r\nshower, the scent will lie well for the dogs. Let us be off at once."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Maintenon.]\r\n\r\nAs the Marchioness de Montespan lost her power over the royal egotist,\r\nMadame de Maintenon gained hers. She was the wife of the poet Scarron,\r\nand was first known to the king as the governess of the children of\r\nMontespan. She was an estimable woman on the whole, very intellectual,\r\nvery proper, very artful, and very ambitious. No person ever had so\r\ngreat an influence over Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. as she; and hers was the ascendency\r\nof a strong mind over a weak one. She endeavored to make peace at\r\ncourt, and to dissuade the king from those vices to which he had so\r\nlong been addicted. And she partially reclaimed him, although, while\r\nher counsels were still regarded, Louis was enslaved by Madame de\r\nFontanges--a luxurious beauty, whom he made a duchess, and on whom he\r\nsquandered the revenues of a province. But her reign was short. Mere\r\nphysical charms must soon yield to the superior power of intellect and\r\nwit, and, after her death, the reign of Madame de Maintenon was\r\ncomplete. As the king could not live without her, and as she refused\r\nto follow the footsteps of her predecessors, the king made her his\r\nwife. And she was worthy of his choice; and her influence was, on the\r\nwhole, good, although she befriended the Jesuits, and prompted the\r\nking to many acts of religious intolerance. It was chiefly through her\r\ninfluence, added to that of the Jesuits, that the king revoked the\r\nedict of Nantes, and its revocation was attended by great sufferings\r\nand privations among the persecuted Huguenots. He had, on ascending\r\nthe throne, in 1643, confirmed the privileges of the Protestants; but,\r\ngradually, he worried them by exactions and restraints, and, finally,\r\nin 1685, by the revocation of the edict which Henry\xc2\xa0IV. had passed, he\r\nwithdrew his protection, and subjected them to a more bitter\r\npersecution than at any preceding period. All the Protestant ministers\r\nwere banished, or sent to the galleys, and the children of Protestants\r\nwere taken from their parents, and committed to the care of their\r\nnearest Catholic relations, or such persons as judges appointed. All\r\nthe terrors of military execution, all the artifices of priestcraft,\r\nwere put forth to make converts and such as relapsed were subjected to\r\ncruel torments. A twentieth part of them were executed, and the\r\nremainder hunted from place to place. By these cruelties, France was\r\ndeprived of nearly six hundred thousand of the best people in the\r\nland--a great misfortune, since they contributed, in their dispersion\r\nand exile, to enrich, by their agriculture and manufactures, the\r\ncountries to which they fled.\r\n\r\nFrom this period of his reign to his death, Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. was a religious\r\nbigot, and the interests of the Roman Church, next to the triumph of\r\nabsolutism, became the great desire of his life. He was punctual and\r\nrigid in the outward ceremonials of his religion, and professed to\r\nregret the follies and vices of his early life. Through the influence\r\nof his confessor, the Jesuit La Chaise, and his wife, Madame de\r\nMaintenon, he sent away Montespan from his court, and discouraged\r\nthose gayeties for which it had once been distinguished. But he was\r\nalways fond of ceremony of all kinds, and the etiquette of his court\r\nwas most irksome and oppressive, and wearied Madame de Maintenon\r\nherself, and caused her to exclaim, in a letter to her brother, "Save\r\nthose who fill the highest stations, I know of none more unfortunate\r\nthan those who envy them."\r\n\r\nThe favorite minister of the king at this time was Louvois, a very\r\nable but extremely prodigal man, who plunged Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. into\r\ninnumerable expenses, and encouraged his taste both for palaces and\r\nwar. It was probably through his intrigues, in order to make himself\r\nnecessary to the king, that a general war again broke out in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: League of Augsburg.]\r\n\r\nIn 1687 was formed the famous League of Augsburg, by which the leading\r\nprinces of Europe united in a great confederacy to suppress the power\r\nand encroachments of the French king. Louvois intrigued to secure the\r\nelection of the Cardinal de Furstemberg to the archbishopric of\r\nCologne, in opposition to the interests of Bavaria, the natural ally\r\nof France, conscious that, by so doing, he must provoke hostilities.\r\nBut this act was only the occasion, not the cause, of war. Louis had\r\nenraged the Protestant world by his persecution of the Huguenots. He\r\nhad insulted even the pope himself by sending an ambassador to Rome,\r\nwith guards and armed attendants equal to an army, in order to enforce\r\nsome privileges which it was not for the interest or the dignity of\r\nthe pope to grant; he had encouraged the invasion of Germany by the\r\nTurks; he had seized Strasburg, the capital of Alsace; he bombarded\r\nGenoa, because they sold powder to the Algerines, and compelled the\r\ndoge to visit him as a suppliant; he laid siege to some cities which\r\nbelonged to Spain; and he prepared to annex the Low Countries to his\r\ndominions. Indeed, he treated all other powers as if he were the\r\nabsolute monarch of Europe, and fear and jealousy united them against\r\nthem. Germany, Spain, and Holland, and afterwards England, Denmark,\r\nSweden, and Savoy, co\xc3\xb6perated together to crush the common enemy of\r\nEuropean liberties.\r\n\r\nLouis made enormous exertions to resist this powerful confederacy.\r\nFour hundred thousand men were sent into the field, divided into four\r\narmies. Two of these were sent into Flanders, one into Catalonia, and\r\none into Germany, which laid waste the Palatinate with fire and sword.\r\nLouvois gave the order, and Louis sanctioned it, which was executed\r\nwith such unsparing cruelty that all Europe was filled with\r\nindignation and defiance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposing Armies and Generals.]\r\n\r\nThe forces of Louis were immense, but those of the allies were\r\ngreater. The Spaniards, Dutch, and English, had an army of fifty\r\nthousand men in Flanders, eleven thousand of whom were commanded by\r\nthe Earl of Marlborough. The Germans sent three more armies into the\r\nfield; one commanded by the Elector of Bavaria, on the Upper Rhine;\r\nanother by the Duke of Lorraine, on the Middle Rhine; and a third by\r\nthe Elector of Brandenburg, on the Lower Rhine; and these, in the\r\nfirst campaign, obtained signal successes. The next year, the Duke of\r\nSavoy joined the allies, whose army was commanded by Victor Amadeus;\r\nbut he was beaten by Marshal Catinat, one of the most distinguished of\r\nthe French generals. Luxembourg also was successful in Flanders, and\r\ngained the great battle of Charleroi over the Germans and Dutch: The\r\ncombined fleet of the English and Dutch was also defeated by the\r\nFrench at the battle of Beachy Head. In the next campaign, Prince\r\nEugene and the Duke of Schomberg distinguished themselves in checking\r\nthe victorious career of Catinat; but nothing of importance was\r\neffected. The following spring, William\xc2\xa0III. and Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., the two\r\ngreat heads of the contending parties, took the field themselves; and\r\nLouis, with the aid of Luxembourg, took Namur, in spite of the efforts\r\nof William to succor it. Some other successes were gained by the\r\nFrench, and Louis retired to Versailles to celebrate the victories of\r\nhis generals. The next campaign witnessed another splendid victory\r\nover William and the allies, by Luxembourg, at Neerwinden, when twelve\r\nthousand men were killed; and also another, by Catinat, at Marsaglia,\r\nin Italy, over the Duke of Savoy. The military glory of Louis was now\r\nat its height; but, in the campaign of 1694-95, he met with great\r\nreverses. Luxembourg, the greatest of his generals, died. The allies\r\nretook Huy and Namur, and the French king, exhausted by the long war,\r\nwas forced to make peace. The treaty of Ryswick, in 1697, secured the\r\ntranquillity of Europe for four years--long enough only for the\r\ncontending parties to recover their energies, and prepare for a more\r\ndesperate contest. Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., however, now acted on the defensive.\r\nThe allied powers were resolved on his complete humiliation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War of the Spanish Succession.]\r\n\r\nWar broke out again in 1701, and in consequence of the accession of\r\nPhilip\xc2\xa0V., grandson of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., to the throne of Spain. This great\r\nwar of the Spanish Succession, during which Marlborough so greatly\r\ndistinguished himself, claims a few explanatory remarks.\r\n\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0II., King of Spain, and the last of the line of the Austrian\r\nprinces, being without an heir, and about to die, selected as his\r\nsuccessor Leopold of Bavaria, a boy five years of age, whose\r\ngrandmother was Maria Theresa. But there were also two other\r\nclaimants--the Duke of Anjou, grandson of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., whose claim\r\nrested in being the grandson of Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip\xc2\xa0IV.,\r\nand sister of Charles\xc2\xa0II., and the Emperor of Germany, whose mother\r\nwas the daughter of Philip\xc2\xa0III. The various European states looked\r\nwith extreme jealousy on the claims of the Emperor of Germany and the\r\nDuke of Anjou, because they feared that the balance of power would be\r\nseriously disturbed if either an Austrian or a Bourbon prince became\r\nKing of Spain. They, therefore, generally supported the claims of the\r\nBavarian prince, especially England and Holland.\r\n\r\nBut the Prince of Bavaria suddenly died, as it was supposed by poison,\r\nand Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. so successfully intrigued, that his grandson was\r\nnominated by the Spanish monarch as heir to his throne. This incensed\r\nLeopold\xc2\xa0II. of Germany, and especially William\xc2\xa0III., who was resolved\r\nthat the house of Bourbon should be no further aggrandized.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of the Duke of Anjou to the Spanish throne, in 1701,\r\na grand alliance was formed, headed by the Emperor of Germany and the\r\nKing of England, to dethrone him. Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. long hesitated between\r\nhis ambition and the interests of his kingdom; but ambition triumphed.\r\nHe well knew that he could only secure a crown to his grandson by a\r\ndesperate contest with indignant Europe. Austria, Holland, Savoy, and\r\nEngland were arrayed against France. And this war of the Spanish\r\nSuccession was the longest, the bloodiest, and the most disastrous war\r\nin which Louis was ever engaged. It commenced the last year of the\r\nreign of William\xc2\xa0III., and lasted thirteen years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duke of Marlborough.]\r\n\r\nThe great hero of this war was doubtless the Duke of Marlborough,\r\nalthough Prince Eugene gained with him as imperishable glories as war\r\ncan bestow. John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, cannot be said to be\r\none of those geniuses who have impressed their minds on nations and\r\ncenturies; but he was a man who gave great lustre to the British name,\r\nand who attained to a higher pitch of military fame than any general\r\nwhom England has produced since Oliver Cromwell, with the exception of\r\nWellington.\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1650, of respectable parents, and was page of honor to\r\nthe Duke of York, afterwards James\xc2\xa0II. While a mere boy, his bent of\r\nmind was discernible, and he solicited and obtained from the duke an\r\nensign\'s commission, and rapidly passed through the military grades of\r\nlieutenant, captain, major, and colonel. During the infamous alliance\r\nbetween Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. and Charles\xc2\xa0II., he served under Marshal Turenne,\r\nand learned from him the art of war. But he also distinguished himself\r\nas a diplomatic agent of Charles\xc2\xa0II., in his intrigues with Holland\r\nand France. Before the accession of James\xc2\xa0II., he was created a\r\nScottish peer, by the title of Baron Churchill. He followed his royal\r\npatron in his various peregrinations, and, when he succeeded to the\r\nEnglish throne, he was raised to an English peerage. But Marlborough\r\ndeserted his patron on the landing of William\xc2\xa0III., and was made a\r\nmember of his Privy Council, and lord of the bed-chamber. Two days\r\nbefore the coronation of William, he was made Earl of Marlborough; but\r\nwas not intrusted with as high military command as his genius and\r\nservices merited, William being apparently jealous of his fame. On the\r\naccession of Anne, he was sent to the Continent with the supreme\r\ncommand of the English armies in the war with Louis about the Spanish\r\nSuccession. His services in the campaign of 1702 secured a dukedom,\r\nand deservedly, for he contended against great obstacles--against the\r\nobstinacy and stupidity of the Dutch deputies; against the timidity of\r\nthe English government at home; and against the veteran armies of\r\nLouis, led on by the celebrated Villars. But neither the campaigns of\r\n1702 or 1703 were marked by any decisive battles. In 1704 was fought\r\nthe celebrated battle of Blenheim, by which the French power was\r\ncrippled, and the hopes of Louis prostrated.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1703 closed disastrously for the allies. Europe was\r\nnever in greater peril. Bavaria united with France and Spain to crush\r\nAustria. The Austrians had only twenty thousand men, while the\r\nBavarians had forty-five thousand men in the centre of Germany, and\r\nMarshal Tallard was posted, with forty-five thousand men, on the Upper\r\nRhine. Marshal Villeroy opposed Marlborough in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Blenheim.]\r\n\r\nBut Marlborough conceived the bold project of marching his troops to\r\nthe banks of the Danube, and there uniting with the Imperialists under\r\nPrince Eugene, to cut off the forces of the enemy before they could\r\nunite. So he left the Dutch to defend themselves against Villeroy,\r\nrapidly ascended the Rhine, before any of the enemy dreamed of his\r\ndesigns. From Mentz, he proceeded with forty thousand men to\r\nHeidelberg, and from Heidelberg to Donauworth, on the Danube, where\r\nhis troops, which had effected a junction with the Austrians and\r\nPrussians, successfully engaged the Bavarians. But the Bavarians and\r\nthe French also succeeded in uniting their forces; and both parties\r\nprepared for a desperate conflict. There were about eighty thousand\r\nmen on each side. The French and Bavarians were strongly intrenched at\r\nthe village of Blenheim; and Marlborough, against the advice of most\r\nof his generals, resolved to attack their fortified camp before it was\r\nre\xc3\xabnforced by a large detachment of troops which Villeroy had sent. "I\r\nknow the danger," said Marlborough; "but a battle is absolutely\r\nnecessary." He was victorious. Forty thousand of the enemy were killed\r\nor taken prisoners; Tallard himself was taken, and every trophy was\r\nsecured which marks a decisive victory. By his great victory, the\r\nEmperor of Austria was relieved from his fears, the Hungarians were\r\noverawed, Bavaria fell under the sway of the emperor, and the armies\r\nof Louis were dejected and discouraged. Marlborough marched back again\r\nto Holland without interruption, was made a prince of the empire, and\r\nreceived pensions and lands from the English government, which made\r\nhim one of the richest and greatest of the English nobility. The\r\npalace of Blenheim was built, and he received the praises and plaudits\r\nof the civilized world.\r\n\r\nThe French were hardly able to cope with Marlborough during the next\r\ncampaign, but rallied in 1706, during which year the great battle of\r\nRamillies was fought, and won by Marlborough. The conquest of Brabant,\r\nand the greater part of Spanish Flanders, resulted from this victory;\r\nand Louis, crippled and humiliated, made overtures of peace. Though\r\nequitable, they were rejected; the allies having resolved that no\r\npeace should be made with the house of Bourbon while a prince of that\r\nhouse continued to sit upon the throne of Spain. Louis appealed now,\r\nin his distress, to the national honor, sent his plate to the mint,\r\nand resolved, in his turn, to contend, to the last extremity, with his\r\nenemies, whom success had intoxicated.\r\n\r\nThe English, not content with opposing Louis in the Netherlands and in\r\nGermany, sent their armies into Spain, also, who, united with the\r\nAustrians, overran the country, and nearly completed its conquest. One\r\nof the most gallant and memorable exploits of the war was the siege\r\nand capture of Barcelona by the Earl of Peterborough, the city having\r\nmade one of the noblest and most desperate defences since the siege of\r\nNumantia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exertions and Necessities of Louis.]\r\n\r\nThe exertions of Louis were equal to his necessities; and, in 1707, he\r\nwas able to send large armies into the field. None of his generals\r\nwere able to resist the Duke of Marlborough, who gained new victories,\r\nand took important cities; but, in Spain, the English met with\r\nreverses. In 1708, Louis again offered terms of peace, which were\r\nagain rejected. His country was impoverished, his resources were\r\nexhausted, and a famine carried away his subjects. He agreed to yield\r\nthe whole Spanish monarchy to the house of Austria, without any\r\nequivalent; to cede to the emperor his conquests on the Rhine, and to\r\nthe Dutch the great cities which Marlborough had taken; to acknowledge\r\nthe Elector of Brandenburg as King of Prussia, and Anne as Queen of\r\nEngland; to remove the Pretender from his dominions; to acknowledge\r\nthe succession of the house of Hanover; to restore every thing\r\nrequired by the Duke of Savoy; and agree to the cessions made to the\r\nKing of Portugal.\r\n\r\nAnd yet these conditions, so honorable and advantageous to the allies,\r\nwere rejected, chiefly through the influence of Marlborough, Eugene,\r\nand the pensionary Heinsius, who acted from entirely selfish motives.\r\nLouis was not permitted to cherish the most remote hope of peace\r\nwithout surrendering the strongest cities of his dominions as pledges\r\nfor the entire evacuation of the Spanish monarchy by his grandson.\r\nThis he would not agree to. He threw himself, in his distress, upon\r\nthe loyalty of his people. Their pride and honor were excited; and, in\r\nspite of all their misfortunes, they prepared to make new efforts.\r\nAgain were the French defeated at the great battle of Malplaquet, when\r\nninety thousand men contended on each side; and again did Louis sue\r\nfor peace. Again were his overtures rejected, and again did he rally\r\nhis exhausted nation. Some victories in Spain were obtained over the\r\nconfederates; but the allies gradually were hemming him around, and\r\nthe king-hunt was nearly up, when unexpected dissensions among the\r\nallies relieved him of his enemies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Utrecht.]\r\n\r\nThese dissensions were the struggles between the Whigs and Tories in\r\nEngland; the former maintaining that no peace should be made; the\r\nlatter, that the war had been carried far enough, and was prolonged\r\nonly to gratify the ambition of Marlborough. The great general, in\r\nconsequence, lost popularity; and the Tories succeeded in securing a\r\npeace, just as Louis was on the verge of ruin. Another campaign, had\r\nthe allies been united, would probably have enabled Marlborough to\r\npenetrate to Paris. That was his aim; that was the aim of his party.\r\nBut the nation was weary of war, and at last made peace with Louis. By\r\nthe treaty of Utrecht, (1713,) Philip\xc2\xa0V. resumed the throne of Spain,\r\nbut was compelled to yield his rights to the crown of France in case\r\nof the death of a sickly infant, the great-grandson of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., who\r\nwas heir apparent to the throne; but, in other respects, the terms\r\nwere not more favorable than what Louis had offered in 1706, and very\r\ninadequate to the expenses of the war. The allies should have yielded\r\nto the overtures of Louis before, or should have persevered. But party\r\nspirit, and division in the English cabinet and parliament, prevented\r\nthe consummation which the Whigs desired, and Louis was saved from\r\nfurther humiliation and losses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Last Days of Louis.]\r\n\r\nBut his power was broken. He was no longer the autocrat of Europe, but\r\na miserable old man, who had lived to see irreparable calamities\r\nindicted on his nation, and calamities in consequence of his ambition.\r\nHis latter years were melancholy. He survived his son and his\r\ngrandson. He saw himself an object of reproach, of ridicule, and of\r\ncompassion. He sought the religious consolation of his church, but was\r\nthe victim of miserable superstition, and a tool of the Jesuits. He\r\nwas ruled by his wife, the widow of the poet Scarron, whom his\r\nchildren refused to honor. His last days were imbittered by\r\ndisappointments and mortifications, disasters in war, and domestic\r\nafflictions. No man ever, for a while, enjoyed a prouder pre\xc3\xabminence.\r\nNo man ever drank deeper of the bitter cup of disappointed ambition\r\nand alienated affections. No man ever more fully realized the vanity\r\nof this world. None of the courtiers, by whom he was surrounded, he\r\ncould trust, and all his experiences led to a disbelief in human\r\nvirtue. He saw, with shame, that his palaces, his wars, and his\r\npleasures, had consumed the resources of the nation, and had sowed the\r\nseeds of a fearful revolution. He lost his spirits; his temper became\r\nsoured; mistrust and suspicion preyed upon his mind. His love of pomp\r\nsurvived all his other weaknesses, and his court, to the last, was\r\nmost rigid in its wearisome formalities. But the pageantry of\r\nVersailles was a poor antidote to the sorrows which bowed his head to\r\nthe ground, except on those great public occasions when his pride\r\ntriumphed over his grief. Every day, in his last years, something\r\noccurred to wound his vanity, and alienate him from all the world but\r\nMadame de Maintenon, the only being whom he fully trusted, and who did\r\nnot deceive him. Indeed, the humiliated monarch was an object of pity\r\nas well as of reproach, and his death was a relief to himself, as well\r\nas to his family. He died in 1715, two years after the peace of\r\nUtrecht, not much regretted by the nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Character.]\r\n\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XIV. cannot be numbered among the monsters of the human race who\r\nhave worn the purple of royalty. His chief and worst vice was egotism,\r\nwhich was born with him, which was cultivated by all the influences of\r\nhis education, and by all the circumstances of his position. This\r\nabsorbing egotism made him insensible to the miseries he inflicted,\r\nand cherished in his soul the notion that France was created for him\r\nalone. His mistresses, his friends, his wives, his children, his\r\ncourt, and the whole nation, were viewed only as the instruments of\r\nhis pride and pleasure. All his crimes and blunders proceeded from his\r\nextraordinary selfishness. If we could look on him without this moral\r\ntaint, which corrupted and disgraced him, we should see an indulgent\r\nfather and a generous friend. He attended zealously to the duties of\r\nhis station, and sought not to shake off his responsibilities. He\r\nloved pleasure, but, in its pursuit, he did not forget the affairs of\r\nthe realm. He rewarded literature, and appreciated merit. He honored\r\nthe institutions of religion, and, in his latter days, was devoted to\r\nits duties, so far as he understood them. He has been foolishly\r\npanegyrized, and as foolishly censured. Still his reign was baneful,\r\non the whole, especially to the interests of enlightened Christianity\r\nand to popular liberty. He was a bigoted Catholic, and sought to\r\nerect, on the ruins of states and empires, an absolute and universal\r\nthrone. He failed; and instead of bequeathing to his successors the\r\npower which he enjoyed, he left them vast debts, a distracted empire,\r\nand a discontented people. He bequeathed to France the revolution\r\nwhich hurled her monarch from his throne, but which was overruled for\r\nher ultimate good.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. et son Si\xc3\xa8cle.

It may have too\r\n     much gossip for what is called the "dignity of history;" but\r\n     that fault, if fault it be, has been made by Macaulay also,\r\n     and has been condemned, not unfrequently, by those most\r\n     incapable of appreciating philosophical history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\xc2\xa0XVII.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM AND MARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William and Mary.]\r\n\r\nFrom Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. we turn to consider the reign of his illustrious\r\nrival, William\xc2\xa0III., King of England, who enjoyed the throne\r\nconjointly with Mary, daughter of James\xc2\xa0II.\r\n\r\nThe early life and struggles of this heroic prince have been already\r\nalluded to, in the two previous chapters, and will not be further\r\ndiscussed. On the 12th day of February, 1689, he arrived at Whitehall,\r\nthe favorite palace of the Stuart kings, and, on the 11th of April, he\r\nand Mary were crowned in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nTheir reign is chiefly memorable for the war with Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., the\r\nrebellion in Ireland, fomented by the intrigues of James\xc2\xa0II., and for\r\nthe discussion of several great questions pertaining to the liberties\r\nand the prosperity of the English nation, questions in relation to the\r\ncivil list, the Place Bill, the Triennial Bill, the liberty of the\r\npress, a standing army, the responsibility of ministers, the veto of\r\nthe crown, the administration of Ireland, the East India Company, the\r\nBank of England, and the funded debt. These topics make the domestic\r\nhistory of the country, especially in a constitutional point of view,\r\nextremely important.\r\n\r\nThe great struggle with Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. has already received all the notice\r\nwhich the limits of this work will allow, in which it was made to\r\nappear that, if Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. was the greater king, William\xc2\xa0III. was the\r\ngreater man; and, although his military enterprises were, in one\r\nsense, unsuccessful, since he did not triumph in splendid victories,\r\nstill he opposed successfully what would have been, without his\r\nheroism, an overwhelming torrent of invasion and conquest, in\r\nconsequence of vastly superior forces. The French king was eventually\r\nhumbled, and the liberties of continental Europe were preserved.\r\n\r\nUnder the wise, tolerant, and liberal administration of William, the\r\nBritish empire was preserved from disunion, and invaluable liberties\r\nand privileges were guaranteed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irish Rebellion.]\r\n\r\nScarcely was he seated on the throne, which his wife inherited from\r\nthe proud descendants of the Norman Conqueror, when a rebellion in\r\nIreland broke out, and demanded his presence in that distracted and\r\nunfortunate country.\r\n\r\nThe Irish people, being Roman Catholics, had sympathized with\r\nJames\xc2\xa0II. in all his troubles, and were resolved to defend his cause\r\nagainst a Calvinistic king. In a short time after his establishment at\r\nSt. Germain\'s, through the bounty of the French king, he began to\r\nintrigue with the disaffected Irish chieftains. The most noted of\r\nthese was Tyrconnel, who contrived to deprive the Protestants of Lord\r\nMountjoy, their most trusted and able leader, by sending him on a\r\nmission to James\xc2\xa0II., by whose influence he was confined, on his\r\narrival at Paris, in the Bastile. Tyrconnel then proceeded to disarm\r\nthe Protestants, and recruit the Catholic army, which was raised in\r\ntwo months to a force of forty thousand men, burning to revenge their\r\npast injuries, and recover their ancient possessions and privileges.\r\nJames\xc2\xa0II. was invited by the army to take possession of his throne. He\r\naccepted the invitation, and, early in 1689, made his triumphal entry\r\ninto Dublin, and was received with a pomp and homage equal to his\r\ndignity. But James did not go to Ireland merely to enjoy the homage\r\nand plaudits of the Irish people, but to defend the last foothold\r\nwhich he retained as King of England, trusting that success in Ireland\r\nwould eventually restore to him the throne of his ancestors. And he\r\nwas cordially, but not powerfully, supported by the French king, who\r\nwas at war with England, and who justly regarded Ireland as the most\r\nassailable part of the British empire.\r\n\r\nThe Irish parliament, in the interest of James, passed an act of\r\nattainder against all Protestants who had assisted William, among whom\r\nwere two archbishops, one duke, seventeen earls, eighteen barons, and\r\neighty-three clergymen. By another act, Ireland was made independent\r\nof England. The Protestants were every where despoiled and insulted.\r\n\r\nBut James was unequal to the task he had assumed, incapable either of\r\npreserving Ireland or retaking England. He was irresolute and\r\nundecided. He could not manage an Irish House of Commons any better\r\nthan he could an English one. He debased the coin, and resorted to\r\nirritating measures to raise money.\r\n\r\nAt last he concluded to subdue the Protestants in Ulster, and advanced\r\nto lay siege to Londonderry, upon which depended the fate of the north\r\nof Ireland. It was bravely defended by the inhabitants, and finally\r\nrelieved by the troops sent over from England under the command of\r\nKirke--the same who inflicted the cruelties in the west of England\r\nunder James\xc2\xa0II. But William wanted able officers, and he took them\r\nindiscriminately from all parties. Nine thousand people miserably\r\nperished by famine and disease in the town, before the siege was\r\nraised, one of the most memorable in the annals of war.\r\n\r\nUlster was now safe, and the discomfiture of James was rapidly\r\neffected. Old Marshal Schomberg was sent into Ireland with sixteen\r\nthousand veteran troops, and, shortly after, William himself (June 14,\r\n1690) landed at Carrickfergus, near Belfast, with additional men, who\r\nswelled the Protestant army to forty thousand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King James in Ireland.]\r\n\r\nThe contending forces advanced to the conflict, and on the 1st of July\r\nwas fought the battle of the Boyne, in which Schomberg was killed, but\r\nwhich resulted in the defeat of the troops of James\xc2\xa0II. The\r\ndiscomfited king fled to Dublin, but quitted it as soon as he had\r\nentered it, and embarked hastily at Waterford for France, leaving the\r\nEarl of Tyrconnel to contend with vastly superior forces, and to make\r\nthe best terms in his power.\r\n\r\nThe country was speedily subdued, and all the important cities and\r\nfortresses, one after the other, surrendered to the king. Limerick\r\nheld out the longest, and made an obstinate resistance, but finally\r\nyielded to the conqueror; and with its surrender terminated the final\r\nefforts of the old Irish inhabitants to regain the freedom which they\r\nhad lost. Four thousand persons were outlawed, and their possessions\r\nconfiscated. Indeed, at different times, the whole country has been\r\nconfiscated, with the exception of the possessions of a few families\r\nof English blood. In the reign of James\xc2\xa0I., the whole province of\r\nUlster, containing three millions of acres, was divided among the new\r\ninhabitants. At the restoration, eight millions of acres, and, after\r\nthe surrender of Limerick, one million more of acres, were\r\nconfiscated. During the reign of William and Mary, the Catholic Irish\r\nwere treated with extreme rigor, and Ireland became a field for\r\nplace-hunters. All important or lucrative offices in the church, the\r\nstate, and the army, were filled with the needy dependants of the\r\ngreat Whig families. Injustice to the nation was constantly exercised,\r\nand penal laws were imposed by the English parliament, and in\r\nreference to matters which before came under the jurisdiction of the\r\nIrish parliament. But, with all these rigorous measures, Ireland was\r\nstill ruled with more mildness than at any previous period in its\r\nhistory, and no great disturbance again occurred until the reign of\r\nGeorge\xc2\xa0III.\r\n\r\nBut the reign of William\xc2\xa0III., however beneficial to the liberties of\r\nEngland and of Europe, was far from peaceful. Apart from his great\r\nstruggle with the French king, his comfort and his composure of mind\r\nwere continually disturbed by domestic embarrassments, arising from\r\nthe jealousies between the Whigs and Tories, the intrigues of\r\nstatesmen with the exiled family, and discussions in parliament in\r\nreference to those great questions which attended the settlement of\r\nthe constitution. A bill was passed, called the _Place Bill_,\r\nexcluding all officers of the crown from the House of Commons, which\r\nshowed the jealousy of the people respecting royal encroachments. A\r\nlaw also was passed, called the _Triennial Bill_, which limited the\r\nduration of parliament to three years, but which, in a subsequent\r\nreign, was repealed, and one substituted which extended the duration\r\nof a parliament to seven years. An important bill was also passed\r\nwhich regulated trials in case of treason, in which the prisoner was\r\nfurnished with a copy of the indictment, with the names and residences\r\nof jurors, with the privilege of peremptory challenge, and with full\r\ndefence of counsel. This bill guaranteed new privileges and rights to\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Freedom of the Press.]\r\n\r\nThe great question pertaining to the Liberty of the Press was\r\ndiscussed at this time--one of the most vital questions which affect\r\nthe stability of government on the one side, and the liberties of the\r\npeople on the other. So desirable have all governments deemed the\r\ncontrol of the press by themselves, that parliament, when it abolished\r\nthe Star Chamber, in the reign of Charles\xc2\xa0I., still assumed its powers\r\nrespecting the licensing of books. Various modifications were, from\r\ntime to time, made in the laws pertaining to licensing books, until,\r\nin the reign of William, the liberty of the press was established\r\nnearly upon its present basis.\r\n\r\nWilliam, in general, was in favor of those movements which proved\r\nbeneficial in after times, or which the wisdom of a subsequent age saw\r\nfit to adopt. Among these was the union of England and Scotland, which\r\nhe recommended. Under his auspices, the affairs of the East India\r\nCompany were considered and new charters granted; the Bank of England\r\nwas erected; benevolent action for the suppression of vice and for the\r\namelioration of the condition of the poor took place; the coinage was\r\nadjusted and financial experiments were made.\r\n\r\nThe crown, on the whole, lost power during this reign, which was\r\ntransferred to the House of Commons. The Commons acquired the complete\r\ncontrol of the purse, which is considered paramount to all other\r\nauthority. Prior to the Revolution, the supply for the public service\r\nwas placed at the disposal of the sovereign, but the definite sum of\r\nseven hundred thousand pounds, yearly, was placed at the disposal of\r\nWilliam, to defray the expense of the civil list and his other\r\nexpenses, while the other contingent expenses of government, including\r\nthose for the support of the army and navy, were annually appropriated\r\nby the Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Act of Settlement--Death of William\xc2\xa0III.]\r\n\r\nThe most important legislative act of this reign was the Act of\r\nSettlement, March 12, 1701, which provided that England should be\r\nfreed from the obligation of engaging in any war for the defence of\r\nthe foreign dominions of the king; that all succeeding kings must be\r\nof the communion of the Church of England; that no succeeding king\r\nshould go out of the British dominions without consent of parliament;\r\nthat no person in office, or pensioner, should be a member of the\r\nCommons; that the religious liberties of the people should be further\r\nsecured; that the judges should hold office during good behavior, and\r\nhave their salaries ascertained; and that the succession to the throne\r\nshould be confined to Protestant princes.\r\n\r\nKing William reigned in England thirteen years, with much ability, and\r\nsagacity, and prudence, and never attempted to subvert the\r\nconstitution, for which his memory is dear to the English people. But\r\nmost of his time, as king, was occupied in directing warlike\r\noperations on the Continent, and in which he showed a great jealousy\r\nof the genius of Marlborough, whose merits he nevertheless finally\r\nadmitted. He died March 8, 1702, and was buried in the sepulchre of\r\nthe kings of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of William.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the animosity of different parties against\r\nWilliam\xc2\xa0III., public opinion now generally awards to him, considering\r\nthe difficulties with which he had to contend, the first place among\r\nthe English kings. He had many enemies and many defects. The Jacobites\r\nhated him because "he upset their theory of the divine rights of\r\nkings; the High Churchmen because he was indifferent to the forms of\r\nchurch government; the Tories because he favored the Whigs; and the\r\nRepublicans because he did not again try the hopeless experiment of a\r\nrepublic." He was not a popular idol, in spite of his great services\r\nand great qualities, because he was cold, reserved, and unyielding;\r\nbecause he disdained to flatter, and loved his native better than his\r\nadopted country. But his faults were chiefly offences against good\r\nmanners, and against the prejudices of the nation. He distrusted human\r\nnature, and disdained human sympathy. He was ambitious, and his\r\nambition was allied with selfishness. He permitted the slaughter of\r\nthe De Witts, and never gave Marlborough a command worthy of his\r\ntalents. He had no taste for literature, wit, or the fine arts. His\r\nfavorite tastes were hunting, gardening and upholstery. That he was,\r\nhowever, capable of friendship, is attested by his long and devoted\r\nattachment to Bentinck, whom he created Earl of Portland, and\r\nsplendidly rewarded with rich and extensive manors in every part of\r\nthe land. His reserve and coldness may in part be traced to his\r\nprofound knowledge of mankind, whom he feared to trust. But if he was\r\nnot beloved by the nation, he secured their eternal respect by being\r\nthe first to solve the problem of constitutional monarchy, and by\r\nsuccessfully ruling, at a very critical period, the Dutch, the\r\nEnglish, the Scotch, and the Irish, who had all separate interests and\r\njealousies; by yielding, when in possession of great power, to\r\nrestraints he did not like; and by undermining the intrigues and power\r\nof so mighty an enemy of European liberties as Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. His heroism\r\nshone brilliantly in defeat and disaster, and his courage and exertion\r\nnever flagged when all Europe desponded, and when he himself labored\r\nunder all the pains and lassitude of protracted disease. He died\r\nserenely, but hiding from his attendants, as he did all his days, the\r\nprofoundest impressions which agitated his earnest and heroic soul.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Isaac Newton and John Locke.]\r\n\r\nAmong the great men whom he encouraged and rewarded, may be mentioned\r\nthe historian Burnet, whom he made Bishop of Salisbury, and Tillotson\r\nand Tennison, whom he elevated to archiepiscopal thrones. Dr. South\r\nand Dr. Bentley also adorned this age of eminent divines. The great\r\npoets of the period were Prior, Dryden, Swift, and Pope, who, however,\r\nare numbered more frequently among the wits of the reign of Anne.\r\nRobert Boyle distinguished himself for experiments in natural science,\r\nand zeal for Christian knowledge; and Christopher Wren for his genius\r\nin architectural art. But the two great lights of this reign were,\r\ndoubtless, Sir Isaac Newton and John Locke, to whom the realm of\r\nnatural and intellectual philosophy is more indebted than to any other\r\nmen of genius from the time of Bacon. The discoveries of Newton are\r\nscarcely without a parallel, and he is generally regarded as the\r\ngreatest mathematical intellect that England has produced. To him the\r\nworld is indebted for the binomial theorem, discovered at the age of\r\ntwenty-two; for the invention of fluxions; for the demonstration of\r\nthe law of gravitation; and for the discovery of the different\r\nrefrangibility of rays of light. His treatise on Optics and his\r\n_Principia_, in which he brought to light the new theory of the\r\nuniverse, place him at the head of modern philosophers--on a high\r\nvantage ground, to which none have been elevated, of his age, with the\r\nexception of Leibnitz and Galileo. But his greatest glory was his\r\nmodesty, and the splendid tribute he rendered to the truths of\r\nChristianity, whose importance and sublime beauty he was ever most\r\nproud to acknowledge in an age of levity and indifference.\r\n\r\nJohn Locke is a name which almost exclusively belongs to the reign of\r\nWilliam\xc2\xa0III., and he will also ever be honorably mentioned in the\r\nconstellation of the very great geniuses and Christians of the world.\r\nHis treatises on Religious Toleration are the most masterly ever\r\nwritten, while his Essay on the Human Understanding is a great system\r\nof truth, as complete, original, and logical, in the department of\r\nmental science, as was the system of Calvin in the realm of theology.\r\nLocke\'s Essay has had its enemies and detractors, and, while many\r\neminent men have dissented from it, it nevertheless remains, one of\r\nthe most enduring and proudest monuments of the immortal and\r\never-expanding intellect of man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anne.]\r\n\r\nOn the death of William\xc2\xa0III., (1702,) the Princess Anne, daughter of\r\nJames\xc2\xa0II., peaceably ascended the throne. She was thirty-seven years\r\nof age, a woman of great weaknesses, and possessing but few\r\ninteresting qualities. Nevertheless, her reign is radiant with the\r\nglory of military successes, and adorned with every grace of fancy,\r\nwit, and style in literature. The personal talent and exclusive\r\nambition of William suppressed the national genius; but the incapacity\r\nof Anne gave scope for the commanding abilities of Marlborough in the\r\nfield, and Godolphin in the cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe memorable events connected with her reign of twelve years, were,\r\nthe war of the Spanish succession, in which Marlborough humbled the\r\npride of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV.; the struggles of the Whigs and Tories; the union\r\nof Scotland with England; the discussion and settlement of great\r\nquestions pertaining to the constitution, and the security of the\r\nProtestant religion; and the impulse which literature received from\r\nthe constellation of learned men who were patronized by the\r\ngovernment, and who filled an unusual place in public estimation.\r\n\r\nIn a political point of view, this reign is but the continuation of\r\nthe reign of William, since the same objects were pursued, the same\r\npolicy was adopted, and the same great characters were intrusted with\r\npower. The animating object of William\'s life was the suppression of\r\nthe power of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV.; and this object was never lost sight of by\r\nthe English government under the reign of Anne.\r\n\r\nHence the great political event of the reign was the war of the\r\nSpanish succession, which, however, pertains to the reign of Louis as\r\nwell as to that of Anne. It was during this war that the great battles\r\nof Blenheim, Ramillies, and Malplaquet attested the genius of the\r\ngreatest military commander that England had ever sent into the field.\r\nIt was this war which exhausted the energies and resources of all the\r\ncontending states of Europe, and created a necessity for many years of\r\nslumbering repose. It was this war which completed the humiliation of\r\na monarch who aspired to the sovereignty of Europe, which preserved\r\nthe balance of power, and secured the liberties of Europe. Yet it was\r\na war which laid the foundation of the national debt, inflamed the\r\nEnglish mind with a mad passion for military glory, which demoralized\r\nthe nation, and fostered those international jealousies and enmities\r\nwhich are still a subject of reproach to the two most powerful states\r\nof Europe. This war made England a more prominent actor on the arena\r\nof European strife, and perhaps contributed to her political\r\naggrandizement. The greatness of the British empire begins to date\r\nfrom this period, although this greatness is more to be traced to\r\ncolonial possessions, manufactures, and commercial wealth, than to the\r\nvictories of Marlborough.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duke of Marlborough.]\r\n\r\nIt will ever remain an open question whether or not it was wise in the\r\nEnglish nation to continue so long the struggle with Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. In a\r\nfinancial and material point of view, the war proved disastrous. But\r\nit is difficult to measure the real greatness of a country, and solid\r\nand enduring blessings, by pounds, shillings, and pence. All such\r\ncalculations, however statistically startling, are erroneous and\r\ndeceptive. The real strength of nations consists in loyalty,\r\npatriotism, and public spirit; and no sacrifices can be too great to\r\nsecure these unbought blessings--"this cheap defence." If the\r\nvictories of Marlborough secured these, gave dignity to the British\r\nname, and an honorable and lofty self-respect to the English people,\r\nthey were not dearly purchased. But the settlement of these questions\r\ncannot be easily made.\r\n\r\nAs to the remarkable genius of the great man who infused courage into\r\nthe English mind, there can be no question. Marlborough, in spite of\r\nhis many faults, his selfishness and parsimony, his ambition and\r\nduplicity, will ever enjoy an enviable fame. He was not so great a\r\nmoral hero as William, nor did he contend against such superior forces\r\nas the royal hero. But he was a great hero, nevertheless. His glory\r\nwas reached by no sudden indulgence of fortune, by no fortunate\r\nmovements, by no accidental circumstances. His fame was progressive.\r\nHe never made a great mistake; he never lost the soundness of his\r\njudgment. No success unduly elated him, and no reverses discouraged\r\nhim. He never forgot the interests of the nation in his own personal\r\nannoyances or enmities. He was magnanimously indulgent to those Dutch\r\ndeputies who thwarted his measures, criticized his plans, and lectured\r\nhim on the art of war. The glory of his country was the prevailing\r\ndesire of his soul. He was as great in diplomacy and statesmanship as\r\non the field of Blenheim. He ever sacrificed his feelings as a\r\nvictorious general to his duty as a subject. His sagacity was only\r\nequalled by his prudence and patience, and these contributed, as well\r\nas his personal bravery, to his splendid successes, which secured for\r\nhim magnificent rewards--palaces and parks, peerages, and a nation\'s\r\ngratitude and praise.\r\n\r\nBut there is a limit to all human glory. Marlborough was undermined by\r\nhis political enemies, and he himself lost the confidence of the queen\r\nwhom he had served, partly by his own imperious conduct, and partly\r\nfrom the overbearing insolence of his wife. From the height of popular\r\nfavor, he descended to the depth of popular hatred. He was held up, by\r\nthe sarcasm of the writers whom he despised, to derision and obloquy;\r\nwas accused of insolence, cruelty, ambition, extortion, and avarice,\r\ndischarged from his high offices, and obliged to seek safety by exile.\r\nHe never regained the confidence of the nation, although, when he\r\ndied, parliament decreed him a splendid funeral, and a grave in\r\nWestminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Marlborough.]\r\n\r\nIn private life, he was amiable and kind; was patient under\r\ncontradiction, and placid in manners; had great self-possession, and\r\nextraordinary dignity. His person was beautiful, and his address\r\ncommanding. He was feared as a general, but loved as a man. He never\r\nlost his affections for his home, and loved to idolatry his imperious\r\nwife, his equal, if not superior, in the knowledge of human nature.\r\nThese qualities as a man, a general, and a statesman, in spite of his\r\ndefects, have immortalized his name, and he will, for a long time to\r\ncome, be called, and called with justice, the _great_ Duke of\r\nMarlborough.\r\n\r\nScarcely less than he, was Lord Godolphin, the able prime minister of\r\nAnne, with whom Marlborough was united by family ties, by friendship,\r\nby official relations, and by interest. He was a Tory by profession,\r\nbut a Whig in his policy. He rose with Marlborough, and fell with him,\r\nbeing an unflinching advocate for the prosecution of the war to the\r\nutmost limits, for which his government was distasteful to the Tories.\r\nHis life was not stainless; but, in an age of corruption, he ably\r\nadministered the treasury department, and had control of unbounded\r\nwealth, without becoming rich--the highest praise which can ever be\r\nawarded to a minister of finance. It was only through the co\xc3\xb6peration\r\nof this sagacious and far-sighted statesman that Marlborough himself\r\nwas enabled to prosecute his brilliant military career.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Whigs and Tories.]\r\n\r\nIt was during his administration that party animosity was at its\r\nheight--the great struggle which has been going on, in England, for\r\nnearly two hundred years, between the Whigs and Tories. These names\r\noriginated in the reign of Charles\xc2\xa0II., and were terms of reproach.\r\nThe court party reproached their antagonists with their affinity to\r\nthe fanatical conventiclers in Scotland, who were known by the name of\r\nthe _Whigs_; and the country party pretended to find a resemblance\r\nbetween the courtiers and the Popish banditti of Ireland, to whom the\r\nappellation of _Tory_ was affixed. The High Church party and the\r\nadvocates of absolutism belonged to the Tories; the more liberal party\r\nand the advocates of constitutional reform, to the Whigs. The former\r\nwere conservative, the latter professed a sympathy with improvements.\r\nBut the leaders of both parties were among the greatest nobles in the\r\nrealm, and probably cared less for any great innovation than they did\r\nfor themselves. These two great parties, in the progress of society,\r\nhave changed their views, and the opinions once held by the Whigs were\r\nafterwards adopted by the Tories. On the whole, the Whigs were in\r\nadvance in liberality of mind, and in enlightened plans of government.\r\nBut both parties, in England, have ever been aristocratic, and both\r\nhave felt nearly an equal disgust of popular influences. Charles and\r\nJames sympathized with the Tories more than with the Whigs; but\r\nWilliam\xc2\xa0III. was supported by the Whigs, who had the ascendency in his\r\nreign. Queen Anne was a Tory, as was to be expected from a princess of\r\nthe house of Stuart; but, in the early part of her reign, was obliged\r\nto yield to the supremacy of the Whigs. The advocates for war were\r\nWhigs, and those who desired peace were Tories. The Whigs looked to\r\nthe future glory of the country; the Tories, to the expenses which war\r\ncreated. The Tories at last got the ascendency, and expelled\r\nGodolphin, Marlborough, and Sunderland from power.\r\n\r\nOf the Tory leaders, Harley, (Earl of Oxford,) St. John, (Lord\r\nBolingbroke,) the Duke of Buckingham, and the Duke of Ormond, the Earl\r\nof Rochester, and Lord Dartmouth, were the most prominent, but this\r\nTory party was itself divided, in consequence of jealousies between\r\nthe chiefs, the intrigues of Harley, and the measureless ambition of\r\nBolingbroke. Under the ascendency of the Tories the treaty of Utrecht\r\nwas made, now generally condemned by historians of both Whig and Tory\r\npolitics. It was disproportioned to the success of the war, although\r\nit secured the ends of the grand alliance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Henry Sacheverell.]\r\n\r\nOne of the causes which led to the overthrow of the Whigs was the\r\nimpeachment and trial of Dr. Henry Sacheverell, an event which excited\r\nintense interest at the time, and, though insignificant in itself,\r\ntouched some vital principles of the constitution.\r\n\r\nThis divine was a man of mean capacity, and of little reputation for\r\nlearning or virtue. He had been, during the reign of William, an\r\noutrageous Whig; but, finding his services disregarded, he became a\r\nviolent Tory. By a sort of plausible effrontery and scurrilous\r\nrhetoric, he obtained the applause of the people, and the valuable\r\nliving of St. Saviour, Southwark. The audacity of his railings against\r\nthe late king and the revolution at last attracted the notice of\r\ngovernment; and for two sermons which he printed, and in which he\r\ninculcated, without measure, the doctrine of passive obedience,\r\nconsigned Dissenters to eternal damnation, and abused the great\r\nprinciple of religious toleration, he was formally impeached. All\r\nEngland was excited by the trial. The queen herself privately\r\nattended, to encourage a man who was persecuted for his loyalty, and\r\npersecuted for defending his church. The finest orators and lawyers of\r\nthe day put forth all their energies. Bishop Atterbury wrote for\r\nSacheverell his defence, which was endorsed by a conclave of High\r\nChurch divines. The result of the trial was the condemnation of the\r\ndoctor, and with it the fall of his adversaries. He was suspended for\r\nthree years, but his defeat was a triumph. He was received, in college\r\nhalls and private mansions, with the pomp of a sovereign and the\r\nreverence of a saint. His sentence made his enemies unpopular. The\r\ngreat body of the English nation, wedded to High Church principles,\r\ntook sides in his favor. But the arguments of his accusers developed\r\nsome great principles--led to the assertion of the doctrines of\r\ntoleration; for, if passive obedience to the rulers of the state and\r\nchurch were obligatory, then all Dissenters might be curbed and\r\nsuppressed. The Whig managers of the trial, by opposing the bigoted\r\nChurchmen, aided the cause of dissent, justified the revolution, and\r\nupheld the conquest by William\xc2\xa0III. And their speeches are upon\r\nrecord, that they asserted the great principles of civil and religious\r\nliberty, in the face of all the authority, dignity, and wisdom of the\r\nrealm. It is true they lost as a party, on account of the bigotry of\r\nthe times; but they furnished another pillar to uphold the\r\nconstitution, and adduced new and powerful arguments in support of\r\nconstitutional liberty. The country gained, if they, as a party, lost;\r\nand though Sacheverell was lauded by his church, his conviction was a\r\ntriumph to the friends of freedom. Good resulted in many other ways.\r\nPolitical leaders learned moral wisdom; they saw the folly of\r\npersecuting men for libels, when such men had the sympathy of the\r\npeople; that such persecutions were undignified, and that, while they\r\ngained their end, they lost more by victory than by defeat. The trial\r\nof Sacheverell, while it brought to view more clearly some great\r\nconstitutional truths, also more effectually advanced the liberty of\r\nthe press; for, surely, restriction on the press is a worse evil, than\r\nthe violence and vituperation of occasional libels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Union of Scotland and England.]\r\n\r\nThe great domestic event of this reign was doubtless the union of\r\nScotland and England; a consummation of lasting peace between the two\r\ncountries, which William\xc2\xa0III. had proposed. Nothing could be more\r\nbeneficent for both the countries; and the only wonder is, that it was\r\nnot done before, when James\xc2\xa0II. ascended the English throne; and\r\nnothing then, perhaps, prevented it, but the bitter jealousy which had\r\nso long existed between these countries; a jealousy, dislike, and\r\nprejudice which have hardly yet passed away.\r\n\r\nScotland, until the reign of James\xc2\xa0II., was theoretically and\r\npractically independent of England, but was not so fortunately placed,\r\nas the latter country, for the development of energies. The country\r\nwas smaller, more barren, and less cultivated. The people were less\r\ncivilized; and had less influence on the political welfare of the\r\nstate. The aristocracy were more powerful, and were more jealous of\r\nroyal authority. There were constant feuds and jealousies between\r\ndominant classes, which checked the growth in political importance,\r\nwealth, and civilization. But the people were more generally imbued\r\nwith the ultra principles of the Reformation, were more religious, and\r\ncherished a peculiar attachment to the Presbyterian form of church\r\ngovernment, and a peculiar hatred of every thing which resembled Roman\r\nCatholicism. They were, moreover, distinguished for patriotism, and\r\nhad great jealousy of English influences.\r\n\r\nJames\xc2\xa0II. was the legitimate King of Scotland, as well as of England;\r\nbut he soon acquired a greater love for England, than he retained for\r\nhis native country; and England being the greater country, the\r\ninterests of Scotland were frequently sacrificed to those of England.\r\n\r\nQueen Anne, as the daughter of James\xc2\xa0II., was also the legitimate\r\nsovereign of Scotland; and, on her decease, the Scotch were not bound\r\nto acknowledge the Elector of Hanover as their legitimate king.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duke of Hamilton.]\r\n\r\nMany ardent and patriotic Scotchmen, including the Duke of Hamilton\r\nand Fletcher of Saltoun, deemed it a favorable time to assert, on the\r\ndeath of Queen Anne, their national independence, since the English\r\ngovernment was neither just nor generous to the lesser country.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, there were many obstacles to a permanent\r\nunion, and it was more bitterly opposed in Scotland than in England.\r\nThe more patriotic desired complete independence. Many were jealous of\r\nthe superior prosperity of England. The people in the Highlands and\r\nthe north of Scotland were Jacobinical in their principles, and were\r\nattached to the Stuart dynasty. The Presbyterians feared the influence\r\nof English Episcopacy, and Scottish peers deprecated a servile\r\ndependence on the parliament of England.\r\n\r\nBut the English government, on the whole, much as it hated Scotch\r\nPresbyterianism and Scotch influence, desired a union, in order to\r\nsecure the peaceful succession of the house of Hanover, for the north\r\nof Scotland was favorable to the Stuarts, and without a union, English\r\nliberties would be endangered by Jacobinical intrigues. English\r\nstatesmen felt this, and used every measure to secure this end.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch were overreached. Force, bribery, and corruption were\r\nresorted to. The Duke of Hamilton proved a traitor, and the union was\r\neffected--a union exceedingly important to the peace of both\r\ncountries, but especially desirable to England. Important concessions\r\nwere made by the English, to which they were driven only by fear. They\r\nmight have ruled Scotland as they did Ireland, but for the intrepidity\r\nand firmness of the Scotch, who while negotiations were pending,\r\npassed the famous Act of Security, by which the Scottish parliament\r\ndecreed the succession in Scotland, on the death of the queen, open\r\nand elective; the independence and power of parliaments; freedom in\r\ntrade and commerce; and the liberty of Scotland to engage or not in\r\nthe English continental wars. The English parliament retaliated,\r\nindeed, by an act restricting the trade of Scotland, and declaring\r\nScotchmen aliens throughout the English dominions. But the conflicts\r\nbetween the Whigs and Tories induced government to repeal the act; and\r\nthe commissioners for the union secured their end.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed, in the famous treaty they at last effected, that the\r\ntwo kingdoms of England and Scotland be united into one, by the name\r\nof _Great Britain_.\r\n\r\nThat the succession to the United Kingdom shall remain to the Princess\r\nSophia, Duchess Dowager of Hanover, and the heirs of her body, being\r\nProtestants; and that all Papists, and persons marrying Papists, shall\r\nbe excluded from, and be forever incapable of inheriting, the crown of\r\nGreat Britain;\r\n\r\nThat the whole people of Great Britain shall be represented by one\r\nparliament, in which sixteen peers and forty-five commoners, chosen\r\nfor Scotland, should sit and vote;\r\n\r\nThat the subjects of the United Kingdom shall enjoy an entire freedom\r\nand intercourse of trade and navigation, and reciprocal communication\r\nof all other rights, privileges, and advantages belonging to the\r\nsubjects of either kingdom;\r\n\r\nThat the laws, in regard to public rights and civil government, shall\r\nbe the same in both countries, but that no alteration shall be made in\r\nthe laws respecting private rights, unless for the evident utility of\r\nthe subjects residing in Scotland;\r\n\r\nThat the Court of Session, and all other courts of judicature in\r\nScotland, remain as before the union, subject, however, to such\r\nregulations as may be made by the parliament of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBeside these permanent regulations, a sum of three hundred and\r\nninety-eight thousand pounds was granted to Scotland, as an equivalent\r\nto the augmentation of the customs and excise.\r\n\r\nBy this treaty, the Scotch became identified with the English in\r\ninterest. They lost their independence; but they gained security and\r\npeace; and rose in wealth and consequence. The nation moreover, was\r\nburdened by the growth of the national debt. The advantage was mutual,\r\nbut England gained the greater advantage by shifting a portion of her\r\nburdens on Scotland, by securing the hardy people of that noble\r\ncountry to fight her battles, and by converting a nation of enemies\r\ninto a nation of friends.\r\n\r\nWe come now to glance at those illustrious men who adorned the\r\nliterature of England in this brilliant age, celebrated for political\r\nas well as literary writings.\r\n\r\nOf these, Addison, Swift, Bolingbroke, Bentley, Warburton, Arbuthnot,\r\nGay, Pope, Tickell, Halifax, Parnell, Rowe, Prior, Congreve, Steele,\r\nand Berkeley, were the most distinguished. Dryden belonged to the\r\npreceding age; to the period of license and gayety--the greatest but\r\nmost immoral of all the great poets of England, from the time of\r\nMilton to that of Pope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wits of Queen Anne\'s Reign.]\r\n\r\nThe wits of Queen Anne\'s reign were political writers as well as\r\npoets, and their services were sought for and paid by the great\r\nstatesmen of the times, chiefly of the Tory party. Marlborough\r\nneglected the poets, and they contributed to undermine his power.\r\n\r\nOf these wits the most distinguished and respectable was Addison, born\r\n1672. He was well educated, and distinguished himself at Oxford, and\r\nwas a fellow of Magdalen College. His early verses, which would now be\r\npronounced very inferior, however attracted the notice of Dryden, then\r\nthe great autocrat of letters, and the oracle of the literary clubs.\r\nAt the age of twenty-seven, Addison was provided with a pension from\r\nthe Whig government, and set out on his travels. He was afterwards\r\nmade secretary to Lord Halifax, and elected a member of the House of\r\nCommons, but was never able to make a speech. He, however, made up for\r\nhis failure as an orator by his power as a writer, being a perfect\r\nmaster of elegant satire. He was also charming in private\r\nconversation, and his society was much sought by eminent statesmen,\r\nscholars, and noblemen. In 1708, he became secretary for Ireland, and,\r\nwhile he resided at Dublin, wrote those delightful papers on which his\r\nfame chiefly rests. Not as the author of Rosamond, nor of Latin\r\nverses, nor of the treatise on Medals, nor of Letters from Italy, nor\r\nof the tragedy of Cato, would he now be known to us. His glory is\r\nderived from the Tatler and Spectator--an entirely new species of\r\nwriting in his age, original, simple, and beautiful, but chiefly\r\nmarked for polished and elegant satire against the follies and bad\r\ntaste of his age. Moreover, his numbers of the Spectator are\r\ndistinguished for elevation of sentiment, and moral purity, without\r\nharshness, and without misanthropy. He wrote three sevenths of that\r\nimmortal production, and on every variety of subject, without any\r\nattempt to be eloquent or _intense_, without pedantry and without\r\naffectation. The success of the work was immense, and every one who\r\ncould afford it, had it served on the breakfast table with the tea and\r\ntoast. It was the general subject of conversation in all polite\r\ncircles, and did much to improve the taste and reform the morals of\r\nthe age. There was nothing which he so severely ridiculed as the show\r\nof learning without the reality, coxcombry in conversation,\r\nextravagance in dress, female flirts and butterflies, gay and\r\nfashionable women, and all false modesty and affectation. But he\r\nblamed without bitterness, and reformed without exhortation, while he\r\nexalted what was simple, and painted in most beautiful colors the\r\nvirtues of contentment, simplicity, sincerity, and cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nHis latter days were imbittered by party animosity, and the malignant\r\nstings of literary rivals. Nor was he happy in his domestic life,\r\nhaving married a proud countess, who did not appreciate his genius. He\r\nalso became addicted to intemperate habits. Still he was ever honored\r\nand respected, and, when he died, was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Swift.]\r\n\r\nNext to Addison in fame, and superior in genius, was Swift, born in\r\nIreland, in 1677, educated at Dublin, and patronized by Sir William\r\nTemple. He was rewarded, finally, with the deanery of St. Patrick\'s.\r\nHe was very useful to his party by his political writings; but his\r\nfame rests chiefly on his poetry, and his Gulliver\'s Travels, marked\r\nand disgraced by his savage sarcasm on woman, and his vilification of\r\nhuman nature. He was a great master of venomous satire. He spared\r\nneither friends nor enemies. He was ambitious, misanthropic and\r\nselfish. His treatment of woman was disgraceful and heartless in the\r\nextreme. But he was witty, learned, and natural. He was never known to\r\nlaugh, while he convulsed the circles into which he was thrown. He was\r\nrough to his servants, insolent to inferiors, and sycophantic to men\r\nof rank. His distinguishing power was his unsparing and unscrupulous\r\nsarcasm and his invective was as dreadful as the personal ridicule of\r\nVoltaire. As a poet he was respectable, and as a writer he was\r\noriginal. He was indifferent to literary fame, and never attempted any\r\nhigher style of composition than that in which he could excel. His\r\nlast days were miserable, and he lingered a long while in hopeless and\r\nmelancholy idiocy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pope--Bolingbroke--Gay--Prior.]\r\n\r\nPope properly belongs to a succeeding age, though his first writings\r\nattracted considerable attention during the life of Addison, who first\r\nraised him from obscurity. He is the greatest, after Dryden, of all\r\nthe second class poets of his country. His Rape of the Lock, the most\r\noriginal of his poems, established his fame. But his greatest works\r\nwere the translations of the Iliad and Odyssey, the Dunciad, and his\r\nEssay on Man. He was well paid for his labors, and lived in a\r\nbeautiful villa at Twickenham, the friend of Bolingbroke, and the\r\ngreatest literary star of his age. But he was bitter and satirical,\r\nirritable, parsimonious, and vain. As a versifier, he has never been\r\nequalled. He died in 1744, in the Romish faith, beloved but by few,\r\nand disliked by the world generally.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Writers of the Age of Queen Anne.]\r\n\r\nBolingbroke was not a poet, but a man of vast genius, a great\r\nstatesman, and a great writer on history and political philosophy, a\r\nman of most fascinating manners and conversation, brilliant, witty,\r\nand learned, but unprincipled and intriguing, the great leader of the\r\nTory party. Gay, as a poet, was respectable, but poor, unfortunate, a\r\nhanger on of great people, and miserably paid for his sycophancy. His\r\nfame rests on his Fables and his Beggar\'s Opera. Prior first made\r\nhimself distinguished by his satire called A City Mouse and a Country\r\nMouse, aimed against Dryden. He was well rewarded by government, and\r\nwas sent as minister to Paris. Like most of the wits of his time, he\r\nwas convivial, and not always particular in the choice of his\r\nassociates. Humor was the natural turn of his mind. Steele was editor\r\nof the Spectator and wrote some excellent papers, although vastly\r\ninferior to Addison\'s. He is the father of the periodical essay, was a\r\nman of fashion and pleasure, and had great experience in the follies\r\nand vanities of the world. It is doubtful whether the writings of the\r\ngreat men who adorned the age of Anne will ever regain the ascendency\r\nthey once enjoyed, since they have all been surpassed in succeeding\r\ntimes. They had not the fire, enthusiasm, or genius which satisfies\r\nthe wants of the present generation. As poets, they had no greatness\r\nof fancy; and as philosophers, they were cold and superficial. Nor did\r\nthey write for the people, but for the great, with whom they sought to\r\nassociate, by whose praises they were consoled, and by whose bread\r\nthey were sustained. They wrote for a class, and that class alone,\r\nthat chiefly seeks to avoid ridicule and abstain from absurdity, that\r\nnever attempts the sublime, and never sinks to the ridiculous; a class\r\nkeen of observation, fond of the satirical, and indifferent to all\r\ninstitutions and enterprises which have for their object the elevation\r\nof the masses, or the triumph of the abstract principles of truth and\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Lord Mahon\'s History of England, which\r\n     commences with the peace of Utrecht, is one of the most\r\n     useful and interesting works which have lately appeared.\r\n     Smollett\'s continuation of Hume should be consulted,\r\n     although the author was greater as a novelist than as an\r\n     historian.

The political importance of Russia was not appreciated at the\r\nclose of the seventeenth century, until the great resources of the\r\ncountry were brought to the view of Europe by the extraordinary genius\r\nof Peter the Great.\r\n\r\nThe history of Russia, before the reign of this great prince, has not\r\nexcited much interest, and is not particularly eventful or important.\r\nThe Russians are descended from the ancient Sclavonic race, supposed\r\nto be much inferior to the Germanic or Teutonic tribes, to whom most\r\nof the civilized nations of Europe trace their origin.\r\n\r\nThe first great event in Russian history is the nominal conversion of\r\na powerful king to Christianity, in the tenth century, named Vladimir,\r\nwhose reign was a mixture of cruelty, licentiousness, and heroism.\r\nSeeing the necessity of some generally recognized religion, he sent\r\nten of his most distinguished men into all the various countries then\r\nknown, to examine their religious systems. Being semi-barbarians, they\r\nwere disposed to recommend that form which had the most imposing\r\nceremonial, and appealed most forcibly to the senses. The\r\ncommissioners came to Mecca, but soon left with contempt, since\r\nMohammedanism then made too great demands upon the powers of\r\nself-control, and prohibited the use of many things to which the\r\nbarbarians were attached. They were no better pleased with the\r\nManichean philosophy, which then extensively prevailed in the East;\r\nfor this involved the settlement of abstract ideas, for which\r\nbarbarians had no relish. They disliked Roman Catholicism, on account\r\nof the arrogant claims of the pope. Judaism was spurned, because it\r\nhad no country, and its professors were scattered over the face of the\r\nearth. But the lofty minarets of St. Sophia, and the extravagant\r\nmagnificence of the Greek worship, filled the commissioners with\r\nadmiration; and they easily induced Vladimir to adopt the forms of the\r\nGreek Church; which has ever since been the established religion of\r\nRussia. But Christianity, in its corrupted form, failed to destroy,\r\nand scarcely alleviated, the traits of barbarous life. Old\r\nsuperstitions and vices prevailed; nor were the Russian territories on\r\nan equality with the Gothic kingdoms of Europe, in manners, arts\r\nlearning, laws, or piety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tartar Conquest.]\r\n\r\nWhen Genghis Khan, with his Tartar hordes, overran the world Russia\r\nwas subdued, and Tartar princes took possession of the throne of the\r\nancient czars. But the Russian princes, in the thirteenth century,\r\nrecovered their ancient power. Alexander Nevsky performed exploits of\r\ngreat brilliancy; gained important victories over Danes, Swedes,\r\nLithuanians, and Teutonic knights; and greatly enlarged the boundaries\r\nof his kingdom. In the fourteenth century, Moscow became a powerful\r\ncity, to which was transferred the seat of government, which before\r\nwas Novgorod. Under the successor of Ivan Kalita, the manners, laws,\r\nand institutions of the Russians became fixed, and the absolute power\r\nof the czars was established. Under Ivan\xc2\xa0III., who ascended the\r\nMuscovite throne in 1462, the Tartar rule was exterminated, and the\r\nvarious provinces and principalities, of which Russia was composed,\r\nwere brought under a central government. The Kremlin, with its mighty\r\ntowers and imposing minarets, arose in all the grandeur of Eastern art\r\nand barbaric strength. The mines of the country were worked, the roads\r\ncleared of banditti, and a code of laws established. The veil which\r\nconcealed Russia from the rest of Europe was rent. An army of three\r\nhundred thousand men was enlisted, Siberia was discovered, the\r\nprinting press introduced, and civilization commenced. But the czar\r\nwas, nevertheless, a brutal tyrant and an abandoned libertine, who\r\nmassacred his son, executed his nobles, and destroyed his cities.\r\n\r\nHis successors were disgraced by every crime which degrades humanity;\r\nand the whole population remained in rudeness and barbarism,\r\nsuperstition and ignorance. The clergy wielded enormous power; which,\r\nhowever, was rendered subservient to the interests of absolutism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accession of Peter the Great.]\r\n\r\nSuch was Russia, when Peter, the son of Alexis Michaelovitz, ascended\r\nthe throne, in 1682--a boy, ten years of age. He early exhibited great\r\nsagacity and talent, but was addicted to gross pleasures. These,\r\nstrangely, did not enervate him, or prevent him from making\r\nconsiderable attainments. But he was most distinguished for a military\r\nspirit, which was treated with contempt by the Regent Sophia, daughter\r\nof Alexis by a first marriage. As soon, however, as her eyes were open\r\nto his varied studies and his ambitious spirit, she became jealous,\r\nand attempted to secure his assassination. In this she failed, and the\r\nyouthful sovereign reigned supreme in Moscow, at the age of seventeen.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did he assume the reins of empire, than his genius blazed\r\nforth with singular brilliancy, and the rapid development of his\r\npowers was a subject of universal wonder. Full of courage and energy,\r\nhe found nothing too arduous for him to undertake; and he soon\r\nconceived the vast project of changing the whole system of his\r\ngovernment, and reforming the manners of his subjects.\r\n\r\nHe first directed his attention to the art of war, and resolved to\r\nincrease the military strength of his empire. With the aid of Le Fort,\r\na Swiss adventurer, and Gordon, a Scotch officer, he instituted,\r\ngradually, a standing army of twenty thousand men, officered, armed,\r\nand disciplined after the European model; cut off the long beards of\r\nthe soldiers, took away their robes, and changed their Asiatic dress.\r\n\r\nHe then conceived the idea of a navy, which may be traced to his love\r\nof sailing in a boat, which he had learned to navigate himself. He\r\nstudied assiduously the art of ship-building, and soon laid the\r\nfoundation of a navy.\r\n\r\nHis enterprising and innovating spirit created, as it was to be\r\nexpected, considerable disaffection among the partisans of the old\r\n_r\xc3\xa9gime_--the old officers of the army, and the nobles, stripped of\r\nmany of their privileges. A rebellion was the consequence; which,\r\nhowever, was soon suppressed, and the conspirators were executed with\r\nunsparing cruelty.\r\n\r\nHe then came to the singular resolution of visiting foreign countries,\r\nin order to acquire useful information, both in respect to the arts of\r\ngovernment and the arts of civilization. Many amusing incidents are\r\nrecorded of him in his travels. He journeyed incognito; clambered up\r\nthe sides of ships, ascended the rigging, and descended into the hold;\r\nhe hired himself out as a workman in Holland, lived on the wretched\r\nstipend which he earned as a ship-carpenter, and mastered all the\r\ndetails of ship-building. From Holland he went to England, where he\r\nwas received with great honor by William\xc2\xa0III.; studied the state of\r\nmanufactures and trades, and sought to gain knowledge on all common\r\nsubjects. From England he went to Austria, intending to go afterwards\r\nto Italy; but he was compelled to return home, on account of a\r\nrebellion of the old military guard, called the _Strelitz_, who were\r\npeculiarly disaffected. But he easily suppressed the discontents, and\r\npunished the old soldiers with unsparing rigor. He even executed\r\nthirty with his own hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peter\'s Reforms.]\r\n\r\nHe then turned himself, in good earnest, to the work of reform. His\r\npassions were military, and he longed to conquer kingdoms and cities.\r\nBut he saw no probability of success, unless he could first civilize\r\nhis subjects, and teach the soldiers the great improvements in the art\r\nof war. In order to conquer, he resolved first to reform his nation.\r\nHis desires were selfish, but happened to be directed into channels\r\nwhich benefited his country. Like Napoleon, his ruling passion was\r\nthat of the aggrandizement of himself and nation. But Providence\r\ndesigned that his passions should be made subservient to the welfare\r\nof his race. It is to his glory that he had enlargement of mind\r\nsufficient to perceive the true sources of national prosperity. To\r\nsecure this, therefore, became the aim of his life. He became a\r\nreformer; but a reformer, like Hildebrand, of the despotic school.\r\n\r\nThe first object of all despots is the improvement of the military\r\nforce. To effect this, he abolished the old privileges of the\r\nsoldiers, disbanded them, and drafted them into the new regiments,\r\nwhich he had organized on the European plan.\r\n\r\nHe found more difficulty in changing the dress of the people, who,\r\ngenerally, wore the long Asiatic robe, and the Tartar beard; and such\r\nwas the opposition made by the people, that he was obliged to\r\ncompromise the matter, and compelled all who would wear beards and\r\nrobes to pay a heavy tax, except priests and peasants: having granted\r\nthe indulgence to priests on account of the ceremonial of their\r\nworship, and to peasants in order to render their costume ignominious.\r\n\r\nHis next important measure was the toleration of all religions, and\r\nall sects, with the exception of the Jesuits, whom he hated and\r\nfeared. He caused the Bible to be translated into the Sclavonic\r\nlanguage; founded a school for the marine, and also institutions for\r\nthe encouragement of literature and art. He abolished the old and\r\nodious laws of marriage, by which women had no liberty in the choice\r\nof husbands. He suppressed all useless monasteries; taxed the clergy\r\nas well as the laity; humiliated the patriarch, and assumed many of\r\nhis powers. He improved the administration of justice, mitigated laws\r\nin relation to woman, and raised her social rank. He established\r\npost-offices, boards of trade, a vigorous police, hospitals and\r\nalmshouses. He humbled the nobility, and abolished many of their\r\nprivileges; for which the people honored him, and looked upon him as\r\ntheir benefactor.\r\n\r\nHaving organized his army, and effected social reforms, he turned his\r\nattention to war and national aggrandizement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His War with Charles\xc2\xa0XII.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles\xc2\xa0XII.]\r\n\r\nHis first war was with Sweden, then the most powerful of the northern\r\nstates, and ruled by Charles\xc2\xa0XII., who, at the age of eighteen, had\r\njust ascended the throne. The _cause_ of the war was the desire of\r\naggrandizement on the part of the czar; the _pretence_ was, the\r\nrestitution of some lands which Sweden had obtained from Denmark\r\nand Poland. Taking advantage of the defenceless state of\r\nSweden,--attacked, at that time, by Denmark on the one side, and by\r\nPoland on the other,--Peter invaded the territories of Charles with an\r\narmy of sixty thousand men, and laid siege to Narva. The Swedish\r\nforces were only twenty thousand; but they were veterans, and they\r\nwere headed by a hero. Notwithstanding the great disproportion between\r\nthe contending parties, the Russians were defeated, although attacked\r\nin their intrenchments, and all the artillery fell into the hands of\r\nthe Swedes. The victory at Narva settled the fame of Charles, but\r\nintoxicated his mind, and led to a presumptuous self-confidence; while\r\nthe defeat of Peter did not discourage him, but braced him to make\r\nstill greater exertions--one of the numerous instances, so often seen\r\nin human life, where defeat is better than victory. But the czar was\r\nconscious of his strength, and also of his weakness. He knew he had\r\nunlimited resources, but that his troops were inexperienced; and he\r\nmade up his mind for disasters at the beginning, in the hope of\r\nvictory in the end. "I know very well," said he, "that the Swedes will\r\nhave the advantage over us for a considerable time; but they will\r\nteach us, at length, to beat them." The Swede, on the other hand, was\r\nintoxicated with victory, and acquired that fatal presumption which\r\nfinally proved disastrous to himself and to his country. He despised\r\nhis adversary; while Peter, without overrating his victorious enemy,\r\nwas led to put forth new energies, and develop the great resources of\r\nhis nation. He was sure of final success; and he who can be sustained\r\nby the consciousness of ultimate triumph, can ever afford to wait. It\r\nis the spirit which sustains the martyr. It constitutes the\r\ndistinguishing element of enthusiasm and exalted heroism.\r\n\r\nBut Peter not only made new military preparations, but prosecuted his\r\nschemes of internal improvement, and projected, after his unfortunate\r\ndefeat at Narva, the union, by a canal, of the Baltic and Caspian\r\nSeas. About this time, he introduced into Russia flocks of Saxony\r\nsheep, erected linen and paper manufactories, built hospitals, and\r\ninvited skilful mechanics, of all trades, to settle in his kingdom.\r\nBut Charles thought only of war and glory, and did not reconstruct or\r\nreproduce. He pursued his military career by invading Poland, then\r\nruled by the Elector of Saxony; while Peter turned his attention to\r\nthe organization of new armies, melting bells into cannon,\r\nconstructing fleets, and attending to all the complicated cares of a\r\nmighty nation with the most minute assiduity. He drew plans of\r\nfortresses, projected military reforms, and inspired his soldiers with\r\nhis own enthusiasm. And his energy and perseverance were soon\r\nrewarded. He captured Marianburgh, a strong city on the confines of\r\nLivonia and Ingria, and among the captives was a young peasant girl,\r\nwho eventually became the Empress Catharine, and to whose counsels\r\nPeter was much indebted for his great success.\r\n\r\nShe was the daughter of a poor woman of Livonia; lost her mother at\r\nthe age of three years; and, at that early age, attracted the notice\r\nof the parish clerk, a Lutheran clergyman: was brought up with his own\r\ndaughters, and married a young sergeant of the army, who was killed in\r\nthe capture of the city. She interested the Russian general, by her\r\nintense grief and great beauty; was taken into his family, and, soon\r\nafter, won the favor of Prince Menzikoff, the prime minister of the\r\nczar; became mistress of his palace; there beheld Peter himself,\r\ncaptivated him, and was married to him,--at first privately, and\r\nafterwards publicly. Her rise, from so obscure a position, in a\r\ndistant country town, to be the wife of the absolute monarch of an\r\nempire of thirty-three millions of people, is the most extraordinary\r\nin the history of the world. When she enslaved the czar by the power\r\nof her charms, she was only seventeen years of age; two years after\r\nthe foundations of St. Petersburg were laid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Building of St. Petersburg.]\r\n\r\nThe building of this great northern capital was as extraordinary as\r\nthe other great acts of this monarch. Amid the marshes, at the mouth\r\nof the Neva, a rival city to the ancient metropolis of the empire\r\narose in five months. But one hundred thousand people perished during\r\nthe first year, in consequence of the severity of their labors, and\r\nthe pestilential air of the place. The new city was an object of as\r\ngreat disgust to the nobles of Russia and the inhabitants of the older\r\ncities, as it was the delight and pride of the czar, who made it the\r\ncapital of his vast dominions. And the city was scarcely built, before\r\nits great commercial advantages were appreciated; and vessels from all\r\nparts of the world, freighted with the various treasures of its\r\ndifferent kingdoms and countries, appeared in the harbor of Cronstadt.\r\n\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0XII. looked with contempt on the Herculean labors of his rival\r\nto civilize and enrich his country, and remarked "that the czar might\r\namuse himself as he saw fit in building a city, but that he should\r\nsoon take it from him, and set fire to his wooden house;" a bombastic\r\nboast, which, like most boasting, came most signally to nought.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New War with Sweden.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, success now turned in favor of Peter, whose forces had been\r\nconstantly increasing, while those of Charles had been decreasing.\r\nCity after city fell into the hands of Peter, and whole provinces were\r\nconquered from Sweden. Soon all Ingria was added to the empire of the\r\nczar, the government of which was intrusted to Menzikoff, a man of\r\nextraordinary abilities raised from obscurity, as a seller of pies in\r\nthe streets of Moscow to be a prince of the empire. His elevation was\r\na great mortification to the old and proud nobility. But Peter not\r\nonly endeavored to reward and appropriate merit, but to humble the old\r\naristocracy, who were averse to his improvements. And Peter was as\r\ncold and haughty to them, as he was free and companionable with his\r\nmeanest soldiers. All great despots are indifferent to grades of rank,\r\nwhen their own elevation is above envy or the reach of ambition. The\r\nreward of merit by the czar, if it alienated the affections of his\r\nnobles, increased the veneration and enthusiasm of the people, who\r\nare, after all, the great permanent foundation on which absolute power\r\nrests; illustrated by the empire of the popes, as well as the\r\ndespotism of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nWhile Peter contended, with various success, with the armies of\r\nSweden, he succeeded in embroiling Sweden in a war with Poland, and in\r\ndiverting Charles from the invasion of Russia. Had Charles, at first,\r\nand perseveringly, concentrated all his strength in an invasion of\r\nRussia, he might have changed the politics of Europe. But he was\r\ninduced to invade Poland, and soon drove the luxurious and cowardly\r\nmonarch from his capital and throne, and then turned towards Russia,\r\nto play the part of Alexander. But he did not find a Darius in the\r\nczar, who was ready to meet him, at the head of immense armies.\r\n\r\nThe Russian forces amounted to one hundred thousand men; the Swedish\r\nto eighty thousand, and they were veterans. Peter did not venture to\r\nrisk the fate of his empire, by a pitched battle, with such an army of\r\nvictorious troops. So he attempted a stratagem, and succeeded. He\r\ndecoyed the Swedes into a barren and wasted territory; and Charles,\r\ninstead of marching to Moscow, as he ought to have done, followed his\r\nexpected prey where he could get no provisions for his men, or forage\r\nfor his horses. Exhausted by fatigue and famine, his troops drooped in\r\nthe pursuit, and even suffered themselves to be diverted into still\r\nmore barren sections. Under these circumstances, they were defeated in\r\na disastrous battle. Charles, struck with madness, refused to retreat.\r\nDisasters multiplied. The victorious Russians hung upon his rear. The\r\nCossacks cut off his stragglers. The army of eighty thousand melted\r\naway to twenty-five thousand. Still the infatuated Swede dreamed of\r\nvictory, and expected to see the troops of his enemy desert. The\r\nwinter set in with its northern severity, and reduced still further\r\nhis famished troops. He lost time by marches and counter-marches,\r\nwithout guides, and in the midst of a hostile population. At last he\r\nreached Pultowa, a village on the banks of the Vorskla. Peter hastened\r\nto meet him, with an army of sixty thousand, and one of the bloodiest\r\nbattles in the history of war was fought. The Swedes performed\r\nmiracles of valor. But valor could do nothing against overwhelming\r\nstrength. A disastrous defeat was the result, and Charles, with a few\r\nregiments, escaped to Turkey.\r\n\r\nHad the battle of Pultowa been decided differently; had Charles\r\nconquered instead of Peter, or had Peter lost his life, the empire of\r\nRussia would probably have been replunged into its original barbarism,\r\nand the balance of power, in Europe, been changed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War with the Turks.]\r\n\r\nBut Providence, which ordained the civilization of Russia, also\r\nordained that the triumphant czar should not be unduly aggrandized,\r\nand should himself learn lessons of humility. The Turks, in\r\nconsequence of the intrigues of Charles, and their hereditary\r\njealousy, made war upon Peter, and advanced against him with an army\r\nof two hundred and fifty thousand men. His own army was composed of\r\nonly forty thousand. He was also indiscreet, and soon found himself in\r\nthe condition of Charles at Pultowa. On the banks of the Pruth, in\r\nMoldavia, he was surrounded by the whole Turkish force, and famine or\r\nsurrender seemed inevitable. It was in this desperate and deplorable\r\ncondition that he was rescued by the Czarina Catharine, by whose\r\naddress a treaty was made with his victorious enemy, and Peter was\r\nallowed to retire with his army. Charles\xc2\xa0XII. was indignant beyond\r\nmeasure with the Turkish general, for granting such easy conditions,\r\nwhen he had the czar in his power; and to his reproaches the vizier of\r\nthe sultan replied, "I have a right to make peace or war; and our law\r\ncommands us to grant peace to our enemies, when they implore our\r\nclemency." Charles replied with an insult; and, though a fugitive in\r\nthe Turkish camp, he threw himself on a sofa, contemptuously cast his\r\neye on all present, stretched out his leg, and entangled his spur in\r\nthe vizier\'s robe; which insult the magnanimous Turk affected to\r\nconsider an accident.\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of Peter on the banks of the Pruth, he devoted\r\nhimself with renewed energy to the improvement of his country. He\r\nembellished St. Petersburg, his new capital, with palaces, churches,\r\nand arsenals. He increased his army and navy, strengthened himself by\r\nnew victories, and became gradually master of both sides of the Gulf\r\nof Finland, by which his vast empire was protected from invasion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peter Makes a Second Tour.]\r\n\r\nHe now reached the exalted height to which he had long aspired. He\r\nassumed the title of _emperor_, and his title was universally\r\nacknowledged. He then meditated a second tour of Europe, with a view\r\nto study the political constitutions of the various states. Thirteen\r\nyears had elapsed, since, as a young enthusiast, he had visited\r\nAmsterdam and London. He now travelled, a second time, with the\r\nadditional glory of a great name, and in the full maturity of his\r\nmind. He visited Hamburg, Stockholm, Lubec, Amsterdam, and Paris. At\r\nthis latter place he was much noticed. Wherever he went, his course\r\nwas a triumphal procession. But he disdained flattery, and was wearied\r\nwith pompous ceremonies. He could not be flattered out of his\r\nsimplicity, or the zeal of acquiring useful knowledge. He visited all\r\nthe works of art, and was particularly struck with the Gobelin\r\ntapestries and the tomb of Richelieu. "Great man," said he,\r\napostrophizing his image, "I would give half of my kingdom to learn of\r\nthee how to govern the other half." His residence in Paris inspired\r\nall classes with profound respect; and from Paris he went to Berlin.\r\nThere he found sympathy with Frederic William, whose tastes and\r\ncharacter somewhat resembled his own; and from him he learned many\r\nuseful notions in the art of government. But he was suddenly recalled\r\nfrom Berlin by the bad conduct of his son Alexis, who was the heir to\r\nhis throne. He was tried, condemned, disgraced, humiliated, and\r\ndisinherited. He probably would have been executed by his hard and\r\nrigorous father, had he not died in prison. He was hostile to his\r\nfather\'s plans of reform, and indecently expressed a wish for his\r\ndeath. The conduct of Peter towards him is generally considered harsh\r\nand unfeeling; but it has many palliations, if the good of his\r\nsubjects and the peace of the realm are more to be desired than the\r\nlife of an ignominious prince.\r\n\r\nPeter prosecuted his wars and his reforms. The treaty of Neustadt\r\nsecured to Russia, after twenty years of unbroken war, a vast increase\r\nof territory, and placed her at the head of the northern powers. The\r\nemperor also enriched his country by opening new branches of trade,\r\nconstructing canals, rewarding industry, suppressing gambling and\r\nmendicity, introducing iron and steel manufacture, building cities,\r\nand establishing a vigorous police.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elevation of Catharine.]\r\n\r\nAfter having settled the finances and trade of his empire, subdued his\r\nenemies at home and abroad, and compelled all the nobles and clergy to\r\nswear fealty to the person whom he should select as his successor, he\r\nappointed his wife, Catharine; and she was solemnly crowned empress in\r\n1724, he himself, at her inauguration, walking on foot, as captain of\r\nher guard. He could not have made a better choice, as she was, in all\r\nsubstantial respects, worthy of the exalted position to which she was\r\nraised.\r\n\r\nIn about a year after, he died, leaving behind him his principles and\r\na mighty name. Other kings have been greater generals; but few have\r\nderived from war greater success. Some have commanded larger armies;\r\nbut he created those which he commanded. Many have destroyed; but he\r\nreconstructed. He was a despot, but ruled for the benefit of his\r\ncountry. He was disgraced by violent passions, his cruelty was\r\nsanguinary, and his tastes were brutal; but his passions did not\r\ndestroy his judgment, nor his appetites make him luxurious. He was\r\nincessantly active and vigilant, his prejudices were few, and his\r\nviews tolerant and enlightened. He was only cruel when his authority\r\nwas impeached. His best portraiture is in his acts. He found a country\r\nsemi-barbarous, convulsed by disorders, a prey to petty tyrannies,\r\nweak from disunion, and trembling before powerful neighbors. He left\r\nit a first-class power, freed in a measure from its barbarous customs,\r\nimproved in social life, in arts, in science, and, perhaps, in morals.\r\nHe left a large and disciplined army, a considerable navy, and\r\nnumerous institutions for the civilization of the people. He left\r\nmore--the moral effect of a great example, of a man in the possession\r\nof unbounded riches and power, making great personal sacrifices to\r\nimprove himself in the art of governing for the welfare of the\r\nmillions over whom he was called to rule. These virtues and these acts\r\nhave justly won for him the title of Peter the _Great_--a title which\r\nthe world has bestowed upon but few of the great heroes of ancient or\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early History of Sweden.]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Charles\xc2\xa0XII. is intimately connected with that of Peter\r\nthe Great; these monarchs being contemporaries and rivals, both\r\nreigning in northern countries of great extent and comparative\r\nbarbarism. The reign of Peter was not so exclusively military as that\r\nof Charles, with whom war was a passion and a profession. The interest\r\nattached to Charles arises more from his eccentricities and brilliant\r\nmilitary qualities, than from any extraordinary greatness of mind or\r\nheart. He was barbarous in his manners, and savage in his resentments;\r\na stranger to the pleasures of society, obstinate, revengeful,\r\nunsympathetic, and indifferent to friendship and hatred. But he was\r\nbrave, temperate, generous, intrepid in danger, and firm in\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nBefore his singular career can be presented, attention must be\r\ndirected to the country over which he reigned, and which will be\r\nnoticed in connection with Denmark; these two countries forming a\r\ngreater part of the ancient Scandinavia, from which our Teutonic\r\nancestors migrated, the land of Odin, and Frea, and Thor, those\r\nhalf-fabulous deities, concerning whom there are still divided\r\nopinions; some supposing that they were heroes, and others,\r\nimpersonations of virtues, or elements and wonders of nature.\r\nThe mythology of Greece does not more fully abound with gods and\r\ngoddesses, than that of the old Scandinavia with rude deities,--dwarfs,\r\nand elfs, and mountain spirits. It was in these northern regions that\r\nthe Normans acquired their wild enthusiasm, their supernatural daring,\r\nand their magnificent superstitions. It was from these regions that\r\nthe Saxons brought their love of liberty, their spirit of enterprise,\r\nand their restless passion for the sea. The ancient Scandinavians were\r\nheroic, adventurous, and chivalrous robbers, holding their women in\r\ngreat respect, and profoundly reverential in their notions of a\r\nsupreme power. They were poor in silver, in gold, in the fruits of the\r\nearth, in luxuries, and in palaces, but rich in poetic sentiments and\r\nin religious ideas. Their chief vices were those of gluttony and\r\nintemperance, and their great pleasures were those of hunting and\r\ngambling.\r\n\r\nFabulous as are most of their legends as to descent, still Scandinavia\r\nwas probably peopled with hardy races before authentic history\r\ncommences. Under different names, and at different times, they invaded\r\nthe Roman empire. In the fifth century, they had settled in its\r\ndesolated provinces--the Saxons in England, the Goths in Spain and\r\nItaly, the Vandals in Africa, the Burgundians in France, and the\r\nLombards in Italy.\r\n\r\nAmong the most celebrated of these northern Teutonic nations were the\r\npirates who invaded England and France, under the name of _Northmen_.\r\nThey came from Denmark, and some of their chieftains won a great name\r\nin their generation, such as Harold, Canute, Sweyn, and Rollo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Introduction of Christianity.]\r\n\r\nChristianity was probably planted in Sweden about the middle of the\r\nninth century. St. Anscar, a Westphalian monk, was the first\r\nsuccessful missionary, and he was made Archbishop of Hamburg, and\r\nprimate of the north.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the Swedes and Danes resembles that of England\r\nunder the Saxon princes, and they were disgraced by the same great\r\nnational vices. During the Middle Ages, no great character appeared\r\nworthy of especial notice. Some of the more powerful kings, such as\r\nValdemar\xc2\xa0I. and\xc2\xa0II., and Canute\xc2\xa0VI., had quarrels with the Emperors of\r\nGermany, and invaded some provinces of their empire. Some of these\r\nprinces were warriors, some cruel tyrants, none very powerful, and all\r\ncharacterized by the vices of their age--treachery, hypocrisy, murder,\r\ndrunkenness, and brutal revenge.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful of these kings was Christian\xc2\xa0I., who founded the\r\ndynasty of Oldenburgh, and who united under his sway the kingdoms of\r\nDenmark, Sweden, and Norway. He reigned from 1448 to 1481; and in his\r\nfamily the crown of Sweden remained until the revolution effected by\r\nGustavus Vasa, in 1525, and by which revolution Sweden was made\r\nindependent of Denmark.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gustavus Vasa.]\r\n\r\nGustavus Vasa was a nobleman descended from the ancient kings of\r\nSweden, and who, from the oppression to which his country was\r\nsubjected by Christian and the Archbishop of Upsal, was forced to seek\r\nrefuge amid the forests of Dalecarlia. When Stockholm was pillaged and\r\nher noblest citizens massacred by the cruel tyrant of the country,\r\nGustavus headed an insurrection, defeated the king\'s forces, and was\r\nmade king himself by the Diet. He, perceiving that the Catholic clergy\r\nwere opposed to the liberties and the great interests of his country,\r\nseized their fortresses and lands, became a convert to the doctrine of\r\nthe reformers, and introduced Lutheranism into the kingdom, which has\r\never since been the established religion of Sweden. He was despotic in\r\nhis government, but ruled for the good of his subjects, and was\r\ndistinguished for many noble qualities.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Gustavus Adolphus was his descendant, and was more\r\nabsolute and powerful than even Gustavus Vasa. But he is chiefly\r\nmemorable as the great hero of the Thirty Years\' War, and as the\r\ngreatest general of his age. Under his sway, Sweden was the most\r\npowerful of the northern kingdoms.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by his daughter Christina, a woman of most\r\nextraordinary qualities; a woman of genius, of taste, and of culture;\r\na woman who, at twenty-seven, became wearied of the world, and of the\r\nenjoyment of unlimited power, and who changed her religion, retired\r\nfrom her country, and abdicated her throne, that she might,\r\nunmolested, enjoy the elegant pleasures of Rome, and be solaced by the\r\nliterature, religion, and art of that splendid capital. It was in the\r\nsociety of men of genius that she spent most of her time, and was the\r\nlife of the most intellectual circle which then existed in Europe.\r\n\r\nShe was succeeded by her cousin, who was elected King of Sweden, by\r\nthe title of _Charles Gustavus\xc2\xa0X._, and he was succeeded by Charles\r\nXI., the father of Charles\xc2\xa0XII.\r\n\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0XII. was fifteen years of age when he came to the throne, in\r\nthe year 1697, and found his country strong in resources, and his army\r\nthe best disciplined in Europe. His territories were one third larger\r\nthan those of France when ruled by Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., though not so thickly\r\npopulated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Days of Charles\xc2\xa0XII.]\r\n\r\nThe young monarch, at first, gave but few indications of the\r\nremarkable qualities which afterwards distinguished him. He was idle,\r\ndissipated, haughty, and luxurious. When he came to the council\r\nchamber, he was absent and indifferent, and generally sat with both\r\nlegs thrown across the table.\r\n\r\nBut his lethargy and indifference did not last long. Three great\r\nmonarchs had conspired to ruin him, and dismember his kingdom. These\r\nwere the Czar Peter, Frederic\xc2\xa0IV. of Denmark, and Frederic Augustus,\r\nKing of Poland, and also Elector of Saxony; and their hostile armies\r\nwere on the point of invading his country.\r\n\r\nThe greatness of the danger brought to light his great qualities. He\r\nvigorously prepared for war. His whole character changed. Quintus\r\nCurtius became his text-book, and Alexander his model. He spent no\r\ntime in sports or magnificence. He clothed himself like a common\r\nsoldier, whose hardships he resolved henceforth to share. He forswore\r\nthe society and the influence of woman. He relinquished wine and all\r\nthe pleasures of the table. Love of glory became his passion, and\r\ncontinued through life; and this ever afterwards made him insensible\r\nto reproach, danger, toil, fear, hunger, and pain. Never was a more\r\ncomplete change effected in a man\'s moral character; and never was an\r\nimproved moral character consecrated to a worse end. He was not\r\ndevoted to the true interests of his country, but to a selfish, base,\r\nand vain passion for military fame.\r\n\r\nBut his conduct, at first, called forth universal admiration. His\r\nglorious and successful defence against enemies apparently\r\noverwhelming gave him a great military reputation, and secured for him\r\nthe sympathies of Christendom. Had he died when he had repelled the\r\nRussian, the Danish, and the Polish armies, he would have secured as\r\nhonorable an immortality as that of Gustavus Adolphus. But he was not\r\npermitted to die prematurely, as was his great ancestor. He lived long\r\nenough to become intoxicated with success, to make great political\r\nblunders, and to suffer the most fatal and mortifying misfortunes.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of his military career was beautifully heroic.\r\n"Gentlemen," said the young monarch of eighteen to his counsellors,\r\nwhen he meditated desperate resistance, "I am resolved never to begin\r\nan unjust war, and never to finish a just one but with the destruction\r\nof my enemies."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles\'s Heroism.]\r\n\r\nIn six weeks he finished, after he had begun, the Danish war having\r\ncompletely humbled his enemy, and succored his brother-in-law, the\r\nDuke of Holstein.\r\n\r\nHis conflict with Peter has been presented, when with twenty thousand\r\nmen he attacked and defeated sixty thousand Russians in their\r\nintrenchments, took one hundred and fifty pieces of cannon, and killed\r\neighteen thousand men. The victory of Narva astonished all Europe, and\r\nwas the most brilliant which had then been gained in the annals of\r\nmodern warfare.\r\n\r\nCharles was equally successful against Frederic Augustus. He routed\r\nhis Saxon troops, and then resolved to dethrone him, as King of\r\nPoland. And he succeeded so far as to induce the Polish Diet to\r\nproclaim the throne vacant. Augustus was obliged to fly, and\r\nStanislaus Leczinski was chosen king in his stead, at the nomination\r\nof the Swedish conqueror. The country was subjugated, and Frederic\r\nAugustus became a fugitive.\r\n\r\nBut Charles was not satisfied with expelling him from Poland. He\r\nresolved to attack him also in Saxony itself. Saxony was then, next to\r\nAustria, the most powerful of the German states. Nevertheless, Saxony\r\ncould not arrest the victorious career of Charles. The Saxons fled as\r\nhe approached. He penetrated to the heart of the electorate, and the\r\nunfortunate Frederic Augustus was obliged to sue for peace, which was\r\nonly granted on the most humiliating terms; which were, that the\r\nelector should acknowledge Stanislaus as king of Poland; that he\r\nshould break all his treaties with Russia, and should deliver to the\r\nKing of Sweden all the men who had deserted from his army. The humbled\r\nelector sought a personal interview with Charles, after he had signed\r\nthe conditions of peace, with the hope of securing better terms. He\r\nfound Charles in his jack boots, with a piece of black taffeta round\r\nhis neck for a cravat, and clothed in a coarse blue coat with brass\r\nbuttons. His conversation turned wholly on his jack boots; and this\r\ntrifling subject was the only one on which he would deign to converse\r\nwith one of the most accomplished monarchs of his age.\r\n\r\nCharles had now humbled and defeated all his enemies. He should now\r\nhave returned to Sweden, and have cultivated the arts of peace. But\r\npeace and civilization were far from his thoughts. The subjugation of\r\nall the northern powers became the dream of his life. He invaded\r\nRussia, resolved on driving Peter from his throne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Misfortunes.]\r\n\r\nHe was eminently successful in defensive war, and eminently\r\nunsuccessful in aggressive war. Providence benevolently but singularly\r\ncomes to the aid of all his children in distress and despair. Men are\r\ngloriously strong in defending their rights; but weak, in all their\r\nstrength, when they assail the rights of others. So signal is this\r\nfact, that it blazes upon all the pages of history, and is illustrated\r\nin common life as well as in the affairs of nations.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles turned as an assailant of the rights of his enemies, his\r\nunfortunate reverses commenced. At the head of forty-three thousand\r\nveterans, loaded with the spoils of Poland and Saxony, he commenced\r\nhis march towards Russia. He had another army in Poland of twenty\r\nthousand, and another in Finland of fifteen thousand. With these he\r\nexpected to dethrone the czar.\r\n\r\nHis mistakes and infatuation have been noticed, and his final defeat\r\nat Pultowa, a village at the eastern extremity of the Ukraine. This\r\nbattle was more decisive than that of Narva; for in the latter the\r\ncareer of Peter was only arrested, but in the former the strength of\r\nCharles was annihilated. And so would have been his hopes, had he been\r\nan ordinary man. But he was a madman, and still dreamed of victory,\r\nwith only eighteen hundred men to follow his fortunes into Turkey,\r\nwhich country he succeeded in reaching.\r\n\r\nHis conduct in Turkey was infamous and extraordinary. No reasonings\r\ncan explain it. It was both ridiculous and provoking. At first, he\r\nemployed himself in fomenting quarrels, and devising schemes to embark\r\nthe sultan in his cause. Vizier after vizier was flattered and\r\nassailed. He rejected every overture for his peaceable return. He\r\nlingered five years in endless intrigues and negotiations, in order to\r\nrealize the great dream of his life--the dethronement of the czar. He\r\nlived recklessly on the bounty of the sultan, taking no hints that\r\neven imperial hospitality might be abused and exhausted. At last, his\r\ninflexible obstinacy and dangerous intrigues so disgusted his generous\r\nhost, that he was urged to return, with the offer of a suitable\r\nescort, and a large sum of money. He accepted and spent the twelve\r\nhundred purses, and still refused to return. The displeasure of the\r\nSultan Achmet was now fairly excited. It was resolved upon by the\r\nPorte that he should be removed by force, since he would not be\r\npersuaded. But Charles resisted the troops of the sultan who were\r\nordered to remove him. With sixty servants he desperately defended\r\nhimself against an army of janizaries, and killed twenty of them with\r\nhis own hand; and it was not until completely overwhelmed and\r\nprostrated that he hurled his sword into the air. He was now a\r\nprisoner of war, and not a guest; but still he was treated with the\r\ncourtesy and dignity due to a king, and conducted in a chariot covered\r\nwith gold and scarlet to Adrianople. From thence he was removed to\r\nDemotica, where he renewed his intrigues, and zealously kept his bed,\r\nunder pretence of sickness, for ten months.\r\n\r\nWhile he remained in captivity, Frederic Augustus recovered the crown\r\nof Poland, King Stanislaus was taken by the Turks, and Peter continued\r\nhis conquest of Ingria, Livonia, and Finland, provinces belonging to\r\nSweden. The King of Prussia also invaded Pomerania, and Frederic\xc2\xa0IV.\r\nof Denmark claimed Bremen, Holstein, and Scania. The Swedes were\r\ndivested of all their conquests, and one hundred and fifty thousand of\r\nthem became prisoners in foreign lands.\r\n\r\nSuch were the reverses of a man who had resolved to play the part of\r\nAlexander, but who, so long as he contented himself with defending his\r\ncountry against superior forces, was successful, and won a fame so\r\ngreat, that his misfortunes could never reduce him to contempt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles\'s Return to Sweden.]\r\n\r\nWhen all was lost, he signified to the Turkish vizier his desire to\r\nreturn to Sweden. The vizier neglected no means to rid his master of\r\nso troublesome a person. Charles returned to his country impoverished,\r\nbut not discouraged. The charm of his name was broken. His soldiers\r\nwere as brave and devoted as ever, but his resources were exhausted.\r\nHe succeeded, however, in raising thirty-five thousand men, in order\r\nto continue his desperate game of conquest, not of defence. Europe\r\nbeheld the extraordinary spectacle of this infatuated hero passing, in\r\nthe depth of a northern winter, over the frozen hills and ice-bound\r\nrocks of Norway, with his devoted army, in order to conquer that\r\nhyperborean region. So inured was he to cold and fatigue, that he\r\nslept in the open air on a bed of straw, covered only with his cloak,\r\nwhile his soldiers dropped down dead at their posts from cold. In the\r\nmonth of December, 1718, he commenced the siege of Fredericshall, a\r\nplace of great strength and importance, but, having exposed himself\r\nunnecessarily, was killed by a ball from the fortress. Many, however,\r\nsuppose that he was assassinated by his own officers who were wearied\r\nwith endless war, from which they saw nothing but disaster to their\r\nexhausted country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Death.]\r\n\r\nHis death was considered as a signal for the general cessation of\r\narms; but Sweden never recovered from the mad enterprises of\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0XII. It has never since been a first class power. The national\r\nfinances were disordered, the population decimated, and the provinces\r\ndismembered. Peter the Great gained what his rival lost. We cannot but\r\ncompassionate a nation that has the misfortune to be ruled by such an\r\nabsolute and infatuated monarch as was Charles\xc2\xa0XII. He did nothing for\r\nthe civilization of his subjects, or to ameliorate the evils he\r\ncaused. He was, like Alaric or Attila, a scourge of the Almighty, sent\r\non earth for some mysterious purpose, to desolate and to destroy. But\r\nhe died unlamented and unhonored. No great warrior in modern times has\r\nreceived so little sympathy from historians, since he was not exalted\r\nby any great moral qualities of affection or generosity, and\r\nunscrupulously sacrificed both friends and enemies to gratify a\r\nselfish and a depraved passion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Voltaire\'s History of Russia, a very attractive\r\n     book, on account of its lively style.

She\r\nwas succeeded by George\xc2\xa0I., Elector of Hanover. He was grandson of\r\nElizabeth, only daughter of James\xc2\xa0I., who had married Frederic, the\r\nKing of Bohemia. He was fifty-four years of age when he ascended the\r\nEnglish throne, and imperfectly understood the language of the nation\r\nwhom he was called upon to govern.\r\n\r\nGeorge\xc2\xa0I. was not a sovereign who materially affected the interests or\r\ndestiny of England; nor was he one of those interesting characters\r\nthat historians love to delineate. It is generally admitted that he\r\nwas respectable, prudent, judicious, and moral; amiable in his temper,\r\nsincere in his intercourse, and simple in his habits,--qualities which\r\ncommand respect, but not those which dazzle the people. It is supposed\r\nthat he tolerably understood the English Constitution, and was willing\r\nto be fettered by the restraints which the parliaments imposed. He\r\nsupported the Whigs,--the dominant party of the time,--and sympathized\r\nwith liberal principles, so far as a monarch can be supposed to\r\nadvance the interests of the people, and the power of a class ever\r\nhostile to the prerogatives of royalty. He acquiesced in the rule of\r\nhis ministers--just what was expected of him, and just what was wanted\r\nof him; and became--what every King of England, when popular, has\r\nsince been--the gilded puppet of a powerful aristocracy. His social\r\nand constitutional influence was not, indeed, annihilated; he had the\r\nchoice of ministers, and collected around his throne the great and\r\nproud, who looked to him as the fountain of all honor and dignity.\r\nBut, still, from the accession of the house of Hanover the political\r\nhistory of England is a history of the acts of parliaments, and of\r\nthose ministers who represented the dominant parties of the nation.\r\nFew nobles were as great as some under the Tudor and Stuart princes;\r\nbut the power of the aristocracy, as a class, was increased. From the\r\ntime of George\xc2\xa0I. to Queen Victoria, the ascendency of the parliaments\r\nhas been most marked composed chiefly of nobles, great landed\r\nproprietors, and gigantic commercial monopolists. The people have not\r\nbeen, indeed, unheard or unrepresented; but, literally speaking, have\r\nhad but a feeble influence, compared with the aristocracy. Parliaments\r\nand ministers, therefore, may be not unjustly said to be the\r\nrepresentatives of the aristocracy--of the wise, the mighty, and the\r\nnoble.\r\n\r\nWhen power passes from kings to nobles, then the acts of nobles\r\nconstitute the genius of political history, as fully as the acts of\r\nkings constitute history when kings are absolute, and the acts of the\r\npeople constitute history where the people are all-powerful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Robert Walpole.]\r\n\r\nA notice, therefore, of that great minister who headed the Whig party\r\nof aristocrats, and who, as their organ, swayed the councils of\r\nEngland for nearly forty years, demands our attention. His political\r\ncareer commenced during the reign of Anne, and continued during the\r\nreign of George\xc2\xa0I., and part of the reign of George\xc2\xa0II. George\xc2\xa0I., as\r\na man or as a king, dwindled into insignificance, when compared with\r\nhis prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole. And he is great, chiefly, as\r\nthe representative of the Whigs; that is, of the dominant party of\r\nrich and great men who sat in parliament; a party of politicians who\r\nprofessed more liberal principles than the Tories, but who were\r\nequally aristocratic in the social sympathies, and powerful from\r\naristocratic connections. What did the great Dukes of Devonshire or\r\nBedford care for the poor people, who, politically, composed no part\r\nof the nation? But they were Whigs, and King George himself was a\r\nWhig.\r\n\r\nSir Robert belonged to an ancient, wealthy, and honorable family; was\r\nborn 1676, and received his first degree at King\'s College, Cambridge,\r\nin 1700. He entered parliament almost immediately after, became an\r\nactive member, sat on several committees, and soon distinguished\r\nhimself for his industry and ability. He was not eloquent, but\r\nacquired considerable skill as a debater. In 1705, Lord Godolphin, the\r\nprime minister of Anne, made him one of the council to Prince George\r\nof Denmark; in 1706, Marlborough selected him as secretary of war; in\r\n1709, he was made treasurer of the navy; and in 1710, he was the\r\nacknowledged leader of the House of Commons. He lost office, however,\r\nwhen the Whigs lost power, in 1710; was subjected to cruel political\r\npersecution, and even impeached, and imprisoned in the Tower. This\r\nperiod is memorable for the intense bitterness and severe conflicts\r\nbetween the Whigs and Tories; not so much on account of difference of\r\nopinion on great political principles, as the struggle for the\r\npossession of place and power.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of George\xc2\xa0I., Walpole became paymaster of the forces,\r\none of the most lucrative offices in the kingdom. Townshend was made\r\nsecretary of state. The other great official dignitaries were the\r\nLords Cowper, Marlborough, Wharton, Sunderland, Devonshire, Oxford, and\r\nSomerset; but Townshend and Walpole were the most influential. They\r\nimpeached their great political enemies, Ormond and Bolingbroke, the\r\nmost distinguished leaders of the Tory party. Bolingbroke, in genius\r\nand learning, had no equal in parliament, and was a rival of Walpole\r\nat Eton.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pretender.]\r\n\r\nThe first event of importance, under the new ministry, was the\r\ninvasion of Great Britain by the Pretender--the Prince James Frederic\r\nEdward Stuart, only son of James\xc2\xa0II. His early days were spent at St.\r\nGermain\'s, the palace which the dethroned monarch enjoyed by the\r\nhospitality of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. He was educated under influences entirely\r\nunfavorable to the recovery of his natural inheritance, and was a\r\ndevotee to the pope and the interests of absolutism. But he had his\r\nadherents, who were called _Jacobites_, and who were chiefly to be\r\nfound in the Highlands of Scotland. In 1705, an unsuccessful effort\r\nhad been made to regain the throne of his father, but the disasters\r\nattending it prevented him from milking any renewed effort until the\r\ndeath of Anne.\r\n\r\nWhen she died, many discontented Tories fanned the spirit of\r\nrebellion; and Bishop Atterbury, a distinguished divine, advocated the\r\nclaims of the Pretender. Scotland was ripe for revolt. Alarming riots\r\ntook place in England. William\xc2\xa0III. was burned in effigy at\r\nSmithfield. The Oxford students pulled down a Presbyterian\r\nmeeting-house, and the sprig of oak was publicly displayed on the 29th\r\nof May. The Earl of Mar hurried into Scotland to fan the spirit of\r\ninsurrection; while the gifted, brilliant, and banished Bolingbroke\r\njoined the standard of the chevalier. The venerable and popular Duke\r\nof Ormond also assisted him with his counsels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Invasion of Scotland.]\r\n\r\nAdvised by these great nobles, assisted by the King of France, and\r\nflattered by the Jacobite faction, the Pretender made preparations to\r\nrecover his rights. His prospects were apparently better than were\r\nthose of William, when he landed in England. The Earl of Mar was at\r\nthe head of ten thousand men; but the chevalier was no general, and\r\nwas unequal to his circumstances. When he landed in Scotland, he\r\nsurrendered himself to melancholy and inaction. His sadness and\r\npusillanimity dispirited his devoted band of followers. He retreated\r\nbefore inferior forces, and finally fled from the country which he had\r\ninvaded. The French king was obliged to desert his cause, and the\r\nPretender retreated to Italy, and died at the advanced age of\r\nseventy-nine, after witnessing the defeat of his son, Charles Edward,\r\nwhose romantic career and misfortunes cannot now be mentioned. By the\r\nflight of the Pretender from Scotland, in 1715, the insurrection was\r\neasily suppressed, and the country was not molested by the intrigues\r\nof the Stuart princes for thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe year which followed the invasion of Scotland was signalized by the\r\npassage of a great bill in parliament, which is one of the most\r\nimportant events in parliamentary history. In 1716, the famous\r\nSeptennial Act, which prolonged parliament from three to seven years,\r\nwas passed. So many evils, practically, resulted from frequent\r\nelections, that the Whigs resolved to make a change; and the change\r\ncontributed greatly to the tranquillity of the country, and the\r\nestablishment of the House of Brunswick. The duration of the English\r\nparliament has ever since, constitutionally, been extended to seven\r\nyears, but the average duration of parliaments has been six years--the\r\nterm of office of the senators of the United States.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the Septennial Act, the efforts of Walpole were\r\ndirected to a reduction of the national debt. He was then secretary of\r\nthe treasury. But before he could complete his financial reforms, he\r\nwas driven from office by the cabals of his colleagues, and the\r\ninfluence of the king\'s German favorites and mistresses. The Earl of\r\nSunderland, who had married a daughter of the Duke of Marlborough, was\r\nat the head of the cabal party, and was much endeared to the Whigs by\r\nhis steady attachment to their principles. He had expected, and\r\nprobably deserved, to be placed at the head of the administration.\r\nWhen disappointed, he bent all his energies to undermine Townsend and\r\nWalpole, and succeeded for a while. But Walpole\'s opposition to the\r\nnew administration was so powerful, that it did not last long.\r\nSunderland had persuaded the king to renounce his constitutional\r\nprerogative of creating peers; and a bill, called the _Peerage Bill_,\r\nwas proposed, which limited the House of Lords to its actual existing\r\nnumber, the tendency of which was to increase the power and rank of\r\nthe existing peers, and to raise an eternal bar to the aspirations of\r\nall commoners to the peerage, and thus widen the gulf between the\r\naristocracy and the people. Walpole presented these consequences so\r\nforcibly, and showed so clearly that the proposed bill would diminish\r\nthe consequence of the landed gentry, and prove a grave to honorable\r\nmerit, that the Commons were alarmed, and rejected the bill by a large\r\nand triumphant majority of two hundred and sixty-nine to one hundred\r\nand seventy-seven.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of this bill, and the great financial embarrassments of the\r\ncountry, led to the restoration of Walpole to office. His genius was\r\neminently financial, and his talents were precisely those which have\r\never since been required of a minister--those which characterized Sir\r\nRobert Peel and William Pitt. The great problem of any government is,\r\nhow to raise money for its great necessities; and the more complicated\r\nthe relations of society are, the more difficult becomes the problem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The South Sea Bubble.]\r\n\r\nAt that period, the English nation were intoxicated and led astray by\r\none of those great commercial delusions which so often take place in\r\nall civilized countries. No mania ever was more marked, more\r\nuniversal, and more fatal than that of the South Sea Company. The\r\nbubble had turned the heads of politicians, merchants, and farmers;\r\nall classes, who had money to invest, took stock in the South Sea\r\nCompany. The delusion, however, passed away; England was left on the\r\nbrink of bankruptcy, and a master financier was demanded by the\r\nnation, to extricate it from the effects of folly and madness. All\r\neyes looked to Sir Robert Walpole, and he did all that financial skill\r\ncould do, to repair the evils which speculation and gambling had\r\ncaused.\r\n\r\nThe desire for sudden wealth is one of the most common passions of our\r\nnature, and has given rise to more delusions than religious\r\nfanaticism, or passion for military glory. The South Sea bubble was\r\nkindred to that of John Law, who was the author of the Mississippi\r\nScheme, which nearly ruined France in the reign of Louis\xc2\xa0XV., and\r\nwhich was encouraged by the Duke of Orleans, as a means of paying off\r\nthe national debt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The South Sea Company.]\r\n\r\nThe wars of England had created a national debt, under the\r\nadministration of Godolphin and Marlborough; but which was not so\r\nlarge but that hopes were entertained of redeeming it. Walpole\r\nproposed to pay it off by a sinking fund; but this idea, not very\r\npopular, was abandoned. It was then the custom for government to\r\nborrow of corporations, rather than of bankers, because the science of\r\nbrokerage was not then understood, and because no individuals were\r\nsufficiently rich to aid materially an embarrassed administration. As\r\na remuneration, companies were indulged with certain commercial\r\nadvantages. As these advantages enabled companies to become rich, the\r\nnation always found it easy to borrow. During the war of the Spanish\r\nSuccession, the prime minister, Harley, afterwards Earl of Oxford, in\r\norder to raise money, projected the South Sea Company. This was in\r\n1710, and the public debt was ten million pounds sterling, thought at\r\nthat time to be insupportable. The interest on that debt was six per\r\ncent. In order to liquidate the debt, Oxford made the duties on wines,\r\ntobacco, India goods, silks, and a few other articles, permanent. And,\r\nto allure the public creditor, great advantages were given to the new\r\ncompany, and money was borrowed of it at five per cent. This gain of\r\none per cent., by money borrowed from the company, was to constitute a\r\nsinking fund to pay the debt.\r\n\r\nBut the necessities of the nation increased so rapidly, that a leading\r\npolitician of the day, Sir John Blount, proposed that the South Sea\r\nCompany should become the sole national creditor, and should loan to\r\nthe government new sums, at an interest of four per cent. New\r\nmonopolies were to be given to the company; and it, on the other hand,\r\noffered to give a bonus of three million pounds to the government. The\r\nBank of England, jealous of the proposal, offered five millions. The\r\ndirectors of the company then bid seven millions for a charter, nearly\r\nenough to pay off the whole redeemable debt of the nation; which,\r\nhowever, could not be redeemed, so long as there were, in addition,\r\nirredeemable annuities to the amount of eight hundred thousand pounds\r\nyearly. It became, therefore, an object of the government to get rid,\r\nin the first place, of these irredeemable annuities; and this could be\r\neffected, if the national creditor could be induced to accept of\r\nshares in the South Sea Company, instead of his irredeemable\r\nannuities, or, as they are now variously called, consols, stocks, and\r\nnational funds. The capital was not desired; only the interest on\r\ncapital. So many monopolies and advantages were granted to the\r\ncompany, that the stock rose, and the national creditor was willing to\r\npart with his annuities for stock in the company. The offer was,\r\ntherefore, accepted, and the government got rid of irredeemable\r\nannuities, and obtained seven millions besides, but became debtor to\r\nthe company. A company which could apparently afford to pay so large a\r\nbonus to government for its charter, and loan such large sums as the\r\nnation needed, in addition, at four per cent., was supposed to be\r\nmaking most enormous profits. Its stock rose rapidly in value. The\r\nnational creditor hastened to get rid of irredeemable annuities--a\r\nnational stock which paid five per cent.--in order to buy shares which\r\nmight pay ten per cent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition of Walpole.]\r\n\r\nWalpole, then paymaster of the forces, opposed the scheme of Blount\r\nwith all his might, showed that the acceptance of the company\'s\r\nproposal would countenance stockjobbing, would divert industry from\r\nits customary channels, and would hold out a dangerous lure to the\r\nunsuspecting to part with real for imaginary property. He showed the\r\nmisery and confusion which existed in France from the adoption of\r\nsimilar measures, and proved that the whole success of the scheme must\r\ndepend on the rise of the company\'s stock; that, if there were no\r\nrise, the company could not afford the bonus, and would fail, and the\r\nobligation of the nation remain as before. But his reasonings were of\r\nno avail. All classes were infatuated. All people speculated in the\r\nSouth Sea stock. And, for a while, all people rejoiced; for, as long\r\nas the stock continued to rise, all people were gainers.\r\n\r\nAnd the stock rose rapidly. It soon reached three hundred per cent.\r\nabove the original par value, and this in consequence of the promise\r\nof great dividends. All hastened to buy such lucrative property. The\r\npublic creditor willingly gave up three hundred pounds of irredeemable\r\nstock for one hundred pounds of the company\'s stock.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mania for Speculation.]\r\n\r\nAnd this would have been well, had there been a moral certainty of the\r\nstockholder receiving a dividend of twenty per cent. But there was not\r\nthis certainty, nor even a chance of it. Still, in consequence of the\r\ngreat dividends promised, even as high as fifty per cent., the stock\r\ngradually rose to one thousand per cent. Such was the general mania.\r\nAnd such was the extent of it, that thirty-seven millions of pounds\r\nsterling were subscribed on the company\'s books.\r\n\r\nAnd the rage for speculation extended to all other kinds of property;\r\nand all sorts of companies were formed, some of the shares of which\r\nwere at a premium of two thousand per cent. There were companies\r\nformed for fisheries, companies for making salt, for making oil, for\r\nsmelting metals, for improving the breed of horses, for the planting\r\nof madder, for building ships against pirates, for the importation of\r\njackasses, for fattening hogs, for wheels of perpetual motion, for\r\ninsuring masters against losses from servants. There was one company\r\nfor carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but no one knew for\r\nwhat. The subscriber, by paying two guineas as a deposit, was to have\r\none hundred pounds per annum for every hundred subscribed. It was\r\ndeclared, that, in a month, the particulars were to be laid open, and\r\nthe remainder of the subscription money was then to be paid.\r\nNotwithstanding this barefaced, swindling scheme, two thousand pounds\r\nwere received one morning as a deposit. The next day, the proprietor\r\nwas not to be found.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to stop these absurd speculations, and yet to monopolize\r\nall the gambling in the kingdom, the directors of the South Sea\r\nCompany obtained an act from parliament, empowering them to prosecute\r\nall the various bubble companies that were projected. In a few days,\r\nall these bubbles burst. None were found to be buyers. Stock fell to\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bursting of the South Sea Bubble.]\r\n\r\nBut the South Sea Company made a blunder. The moral effect of the\r\nbursting of so many bubbles was to open the eyes of the nation to the\r\ngreatest bubble of all. The credit of the South Sea Company declined.\r\nStocks fell from one thousand per cent to two hundred in a few days.\r\nAll wanted to sell, nobody to buy. Bankers and merchants failed, and\r\nnobles and country gentlemen became impoverished.\r\n\r\nIn this general distress, Walpole was summoned to power, in older to\r\nextricate the nation, on the eve of bankruptcy. He proposed a plan,\r\nwhich was adopted, and which saved the credit of the nation. He\r\ningrafted nine millions of the South Sea stock into the Bank of\r\nEngland, and nine millions more into the East India Company; and\r\ngovernment gave up the seven millions of bonus which the company had\r\npromised.\r\n\r\nBy this assistance, the company was able to fulfil its engagements,\r\nalthough all who purchased stock when it had arisen beyond one hundred\r\nper cent. of its original value, lost money. It is strange that the\r\nstock, after all, remained at a premium of one hundred per cent.; of\r\ncourse, the original proprietors gained one hundred per cent., and\r\nthose who paid one hundred per cent. premium lost nothing. But these\r\nconstituted a small fraction of the people who had speculated, and who\r\npaid from one hundred to nine hundred per cent. premium. Government,\r\ntoo, gained by reducing interest on irredeemable bonds from five to\r\nfour per cent., although it lost the promised bonus of seven millions.\r\n\r\nThe South Sea bubble did not destroy the rage for speculation,\r\nalthough it taught many useful truths--that national prosperity is not\r\nadvanced by stockjobbing; that financiers, however great their genius,\r\ngenerally overreach themselves; that great dividends are connected\r\nwith great risk; that circumstances beyond human control will defeat\r\nthe best-laid plan; that it is better to repose upon the operation of\r\nthe ordinary laws of trade; and that nothing but strict integrity and\r\nindustry will succeed in the end. From the time of Sir Robert Walpole,\r\nmoney has seldom been worth, in England, over five per cent., and\r\nlarger dividends on vested property have generally been succeeded by\r\nheavy losses, however plausible the promises and clear the statements\r\nof stockjobbers and speculators.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enlightened Policy of Walpole.]\r\n\r\nAfter the explosion of the South Sea Company, Walpole became possessed\r\nof almost unlimited power. And one of the first objects to which he\r\ndirected attention, after settling the finances, was the removal of\r\npetty restrictions on commerce. He abolished the export duties on one\r\nhundred and six articles of British manufacture, and allowed\r\nthirty-eight articles of raw material to be imported duty free. This\r\nregulation was made to facilitate trade with the colonies, and prevent\r\nthem from manufacturing; and this regulation accomplished the end\r\ndesired. Both England and the colonies were enriched. It was doubtless\r\nthe true policy of British statesmen then, as now, to advance the\r\ncommercial, manufacturing, and agricultural interests of Great\r\nBritain, rather than meddle with foreign wars, or seek glory on the\r\nfield of battle. The principles of Sir Robert Walpole were essentially\r\npacific; and under his administration, England made a great advance in\r\nsubstantial prosperity. In this policy he surpassed all the statesmen\r\nwho preceded or succeeded him, and this constituted his glory and\r\noriginality.\r\n\r\nBut liberal and enlightened as was the general course of Walpole, he\r\nstill made blunders, and showed occasional illiberality. He caused a\r\nfine of one hundred thousand pounds to be inflicted on the Catholics,\r\non the plea that they were a disaffected body. He persecuted Bishop\r\nAtterbury, and permitted Bolingbroke, with his restless spirit of\r\nintrigue, to return to his country, and to be reinstated in his\r\nproperty and titles. He flattered the Duchess of Kendall, the mistress\r\nof the king, and stooped to all the arts of corruption and bribery.\r\nThere never was a period of greater political corruption than during\r\nthe administration of this minister. Sycophancy, meanness, and\r\nhypocrisy were resorted to by the statesmen of the age, who generally\r\nsought their own interests rather than the welfare of the nation.\r\nThere were, however, exceptions. Townsend, the great rival and\r\ncoadjutor of Walpole, retired from office with an unsullied fame for\r\nintegrity and disinterestedness; and Walpole, while he bribed others,\r\ndid not enrich himself.\r\n\r\nKing George\xc2\xa0I. died on the 11th of June, 1727, suddenly, by apoplexy,\r\nand was succeeded by his son George\xc2\xa0II., a man who resembled his\r\nfather in disposition and character, and was superior to him in\r\nknowledge of the English constitution, though both were inclined to\r\nsteer the British bark by the Hanoverian rudder. Like his father, he\r\nwas reserved, phlegmatic, cautious, sincere, fond of business,\r\neconomical, and attached to Whig principles. He was fortunate in his\r\nwife, Queen Caroline, one of the most excellent women of the age,\r\nlearned, religious, charitable, and sensible; the patroness of divines\r\nand scholars; fond of discussion on metaphysical subjects, and a\r\ncorrespondent of the distinguished Leibnitz.\r\n\r\nThe new king disliked Walpole, but could not do without him, and\r\ntherefore continued him in office. Indeed, the king had the sense to\r\nperceive that England was to be governed only by the man in whom the\r\nnation had confidence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: East India Company.]\r\n\r\nIn 1730, Walpole rechartered the East India Company, the most gigantic\r\nmonopoly in the history of nations. As early as 1599, an association\r\nhad been formed in England for trade to the East Indies. This\r\nassociation was made in consequence of the Dutch and Portuguese\r\nsettlements and enterprises, which aroused the commercial jealousy of\r\nEngland. The capital was sixty-eight thousand pounds. In 1600, Queen\r\nElizabeth gave the company a royal charter. By this charter, the\r\ncompany obtained the right of purchasing land, without limit, in\r\nIndia, and the monopoly of the trade for fifteen years. But the\r\ncompany contended with many obstacles. The first voyage was made by\r\nfour ships and one pinnace, having on board twenty-eight thousand\r\npounds in bullion, and seven thousand pounds in merchandise, such as\r\ntin, cutlery, and glass.\r\n\r\nDuring the civil wars, the company\'s affairs were embarrassed, owing\r\nto the unsettled state of England. On the accession of Charles\xc2\xa0II.,\r\nthe company obtained a new charter, which not only confirmed the old\r\nprivileges, but gave it the power of making peace and war with the\r\nnative princes of India. The capital stock was increased to one\r\nmillion five hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nMuch opposition was made by Bolingbroke and the Tories to the\r\nrecharter of this institution; but the ministry carried their point,\r\nand a new charter was granted on the condition of the company paying\r\nto government two hundred thousand pounds, and reducing the interest\r\nof the government debts one per cent. per annum. By this time, the\r\ncompany, although it had not greatly enlarged its jurisdiction in\r\nIndia, had accumulated great wealth. Its powers and possessions will\r\nbe more fully treated when the victories of Clive shall be presented.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the Duke of Newcastle came into the cabinet whose\r\nfuture administration will form the subject of a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resignation of Townsend.]\r\n\r\nIn 1730 also occurred the disagreement between Walpole and Lord\r\nTownsend, which ended in the resignation of the latter, a man whose\r\nimpetuous and frank temper ill fitted him to work with so cautious and\r\nnon-committal a statesman as his powerful rival. He passed the evening\r\nof his days in rural pursuits and agricultural experiments, keeping\r\nopen house, devoting himself to his family and friends, never\r\nhankering after the power he had lost, never even revisiting London,\r\nand finding his richest solace in literature and simple agricultural\r\npleasures--the pattern of a lofty and cultivated nobleman.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of Townsend enabled Walpole to take more part in\r\nforeign negotiations; and he exerted his talents, like Fleury in\r\nFrance, to preserve the peace of Europe. The peace policy of Walpole\r\nentitles him to the gratitude of his country. More than any other man\r\nof his age, he apprehended the true glory and interests of nations.\r\nHad Walpole paid as much attention to the intellectual improvement of\r\nhis countrymen, as he did to the refinements of material life and to\r\nphysical progress, he would have merited still higher praises. But he\r\ndespised learning, and neglected literary men. And they turned against\r\nhim and his administration, and, by their sarcasm and invective, did\r\nmuch to undermine his power. Pope, Swift, and Gay might have lent him\r\npowerful aid by their satirical pen; but he passed them by with\r\ncontemptuous indifference, and they gave to Bolingbroke what they\r\nwithheld from Walpole.\r\n\r\nNext to the pacific policy of the minister, the most noticeable\r\npeculiarity of his administration was his zeal to improve the\r\nfinances. He opposed speculations, and sought a permanent revenue from\r\nfixed principles. He regarded the national debt as a great burden, and\r\nstrove to abolish it; and, when that was found to be impracticable,\r\nsought to prevent its further accumulation. He was not, indeed, always\r\ntrue to his policy; but he pursued it on the whole, consistently. He\r\nfavored the agricultural interests, and was inclined to raise the\r\nnecessary revenue by a tax on articles used, rather than by direct\r\ntaxation on property or income, or articles imported. Hence he is the\r\nfather of the excise scheme--a scheme still adopted in England, but\r\nwhich would be intolerable in this country. In this scheme, his grand\r\nobject was to ease the landed proprietor, and to prevent smuggling, by\r\nmaking smuggling no object. But the opposition to the Excise Bill was\r\nso great that Sir Robert abandoned it; and this relinquishment of his\r\nfavorite scheme is one of the most striking peculiarities of his\r\nadministration. He never pushed matters to extremity. He ever yielded\r\nto popular clamor. He perceived that an armed force would be necessary\r\nin order to collect the excise, and preferred to yield his cherished\r\nmeasures to run the danger of incurring greater evils than financial\r\nembarrassments. His spirit of conciliation, often exercised in the\r\nplenitude of power, prolonged his reign. This policy was the result of\r\nimmense experience and practical knowledge of human nature, of which\r\nhe was a great master.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unpopularity of Walpole.]\r\n\r\nBut Sir Robert was not allowed to pursue to the end his pacific, any\r\nmore than his financial policy. The clamors of interested merchants,\r\nthe violence of party spirit, and the dreams of heroic grandeur on the\r\npart of politicians, overcame the repugnance of the minister, and\r\nplunged England in a disastrous Spanish war; and a war soon succeeded\r\nby that of the Austrian Succession, in which Maria Theresa was the\r\ninjured, and Frederic the Great the offending party. But this war,\r\nwhich was carried on chiefly during the subsequent administration,\r\nwill be hereafter alluded to.\r\n\r\nAlthough Walpole was opposed by some of the ablest men in England--by\r\nPulteney, Sir William Windham, and the Lords Chesterfield, Carteret,\r\nand Bolingbroke, his power was almost absolute from 1730 to 1740. His\r\nmost powerful assistance was derived from Mr. Yorke, afterwards the\r\nLord Chancellor Hardwicke, one of the greatest lawyers that England\r\nhas produced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of his Power.]\r\n\r\nIn 1740, his power began to decline, and rapidly waned. He lost a\r\npowerful friend and protector by the death of Queen Caroline, whose\r\nintercessions with the king were ever listened to with respectful\r\nconsideration. But he had almost insurmountable obstacles to contend\r\nwith--the distrust of the king, the bitter hatred of the Prince of\r\nWales, the violent opposition of the leading statesmen in parliament,\r\nand universal envy. Moreover, he had grown careless and secure. He\r\nfancied that no one could rule England but himself. But hatred,\r\nopposition, envy, and unsuccessful military operations, forced him\r\nfrom his place. No shipwrecked pilot ever clung to the rudder of a\r\nsinking ship with more desperate tenacity than did this once powerful\r\nminister to the helm of state. And he did not relinquish it until he\r\nwas driven from it by the desertion of all his friends, and the\r\ngeneral clamor of the people. The king, however, appreciated the value\r\nof his services, and created him Earl of Orford, a dignity which had\r\nbeen offered him before, but which, with self-controlling policy, he\r\nhad unhesitatingly declined. Like Sir Robert Peel in later times, he\r\ndid not wish to be buried in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nHis retirement (1742) amid the beeches and oaks of his country seat\r\nwas irksome and insipid. He had no taste for history, or science, or\r\nelegant literature, or quiet pleasures. His tumultuous public life had\r\nengendered other tastes. "I wish," said he to a friend, "I took as\r\nmuch delight in reading as you do. It would alleviate my tedious\r\nhours." But the fallen minister, though uneasy and restless, was not\r\nbitter or severe. He retained his good humor to the last, and to the\r\nlast discharged all the rites of an elegant hospitality. Said his\r\nenemy, Pope,--\r\n\r\n "Seen him I have, but in his happier hour\r\n  Of social pleasure--ill exchanged for power;\r\n  Seen him, uncumbered by the venal tribe,\r\n  Smile without art, and win without a bribe."\r\n\r\nHe had the habit of "laughing the heart\'s laugh," which it is only in\r\nthe power of noble natures to exercise. His manners were winning, his\r\nconversation frank, and his ordinary intercourse divested of vanity\r\nand pomp. He had many warm personal friends, and did not enrich\r\nhimself, as Marlborough did, while he enriched those who served him.\r\nHe kept a public table at Houghton, to which all gentlemen in the\r\ncountry had free access. He was fond of hunting and country sports,\r\nand had more taste for pictures than for books. He was not what would\r\nbe called a man of genius or erudition, but had a sound judgment,\r\ngreat sagacity, wonderful self-command, and undoubted patriotism. As a\r\nwise and successful ruler, he will long be held in respect, though he\r\nwill never secure veneration.\r\n\r\nIt was during the latter years of the administration of Walpole that\r\nEngland was electrified by the preaching of Whitefield and Wesley, and\r\nthe sect of the Methodists arose, which has exercised a powerful\r\ninfluence on the morals, religion, and social life of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Wesley.]\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley, who may rank with Augustine, Pelagius, Calvin, Arminius,\r\nor Jansen, as the founder of a sect, was demanded by the age in which\r\nhe lived. Never, since the Reformation, was the state of religion so\r\ncold in England. The Established Church had triumphed over all her\r\nenemies. Puritanism had ceased to become offensive, and had even\r\nbecome respectable. The age of fox-hunting parsons had commenced, and\r\nthe clergy were the dependants of great families, easy in their\r\nmanners, and fond of the pleasures of the table. They were not\r\nexpected to be very great scholars, or very grave companions. If they\r\nread the service with propriety, did not scandalize their cause by\r\ngross indulgences, and did not meddle with the two exciting subjects\r\nof all ages,--politics and religion,--they were sure of peace and\r\nplenty. But their churches were comparatively deserted, and infidel\r\nopinions had been long undermining respect for the institutions and\r\nministers of religion. Swearing and drunkenness were fashionable vices\r\namong the higher classes, while low pleasures and lamentable ignorance\r\ncharacterized the people. The dissenting sects were more religious,\r\nbut were formal and cold. Their ministers preached, too often, a mere\r\ntechnical divinity, or a lax system of ethics. The Independents were\r\ninclined to a frigid Arminianism, and the Presbyterians were passing\r\nthrough the change from ultra Calvinism to Arianism and Socinianism.\r\n\r\nThe reformation was not destined to come from Dissenters, but from the\r\nbosom of the Established Church, a reformation which bore the same\r\nrelation to Protestantism as that effected by St. Francis bore to\r\nRoman Catholicism in the thirteenth century; a reformation among the\r\npoorer classes, who did not wish to be separated from the Church\r\nEstablishment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Life of Wesley.]\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley belonged to a good family, his father being a respectable\r\nclergyman in a market town. He was born in 1703, was educated at\r\nOxford, and for the church. At the age of twenty, he received orders\r\nfrom the Bishop of Oxford, and was, shortly after, chosen fellow of\r\nLincoln College, and then Greek lecturer.\r\n\r\nWhile at Oxford, he and his brother Charles, who was also a fellow and\r\na fine scholar, excited the ridicule of the University for the\r\nstrictness of their lives, and their methodical way of living, which\r\ncaused their companions to give them the name of _Methodists_. Two\r\nother young men joined them--James Hervey, author of the Meditations,\r\nand George Whitefield. The fraternity at length numbered fifteen young\r\nmen, the members of which met frequently for religious purposes,\r\nvisited prisons and the sick, fasted zealously on Wednesdays and\r\nFridays, and bound themselves by rules, which, in many respects,\r\nresembled those which Ignatius Loyola imposed on his followers. The\r\nImitation of Christ, by A Kempis, and Taylor\'s Holy Living, were their\r\ngrand text-books, both of which were studied for their devotional\r\nspirit. But the Holy Living was the favorite book of Wesley, who did\r\nnot fully approve of the rigid asceticism of the venerable mystic of\r\nthe Middle Ages. The writings of William Law, also, had great\r\ninfluence on the mind of Wesley; but his religious views were not\r\nmatured until after his return from Georgia, where he had labored as a\r\nmissionary, under the auspices of Oglethorpe. The Moravians, whom he\r\nmet with both in America and Germany, completed the work which Taylor\r\nhad begun; and from their beautiful establishments he also learned\r\nmany principles of that wonderful system of government which he so\r\nsuccessfully introduced among his followers.\r\n\r\nWesley continued his labors with earnestness; but these were also\r\nattended with some extravagances, which Dr. Potter, the worthy Bishop\r\nof London, and other Churchmen, could not understand. And though he\r\npreached with great popular acceptance, and gained wonderful eclat,\r\nthough he was much noticed in society and even dined with the king at\r\nHampton Court, and with the Prince of Wales at St. James\'s, still the\r\nchurches were gradually shut against him. When Whitefield returned\r\nfrom Georgia, having succeeded Wesley as a missionary in that colony,\r\nand finding so much opposition from the dignitaries of the Church,\r\nalthough neither he nor Wesley had seceded from the Church; and, above\r\nall, excited by the popular favor he received,--for the churches would\r\nnot hold half who flocked to hear him preach,--he resolved to address\r\nthe people in the open air. The excitement he produced was\r\nunparalleled. Near Bristol, he sometimes assembled as many as twenty\r\nthousand. But they were chiefly the colliers, drawn forth from their\r\nsubterranean working places. But his eloquence had equal fascination\r\nfor the people of London and the vicinity. In Moorfields, on\r\nKennington Common, and on Blackheath, he sometimes drew a crowd of\r\nforty thousand people, all of whom could hear his voice. He could draw\r\ntears from Hume, and money from Dr. Franklin. He could convulse a\r\ncongregation with terror, and then inspire them with the brightest\r\nhopes. He was a greater artist than Bossuet or Bourdaloue. He never\r\nlost his self-possession, or hesitated for appropriate language. But\r\nhis great power was in his thorough earnestness, and almost inspired\r\nenthusiasm. No one doubted his sincerity, and all were impressed with\r\nthe spirituality and reality of the great truths which he presented.\r\nAnd wonderful results followed from his preaching, and from that of\r\nhis brethren. A great religious revival spread over England,\r\nespecially among the middle and lower classes, the effects of which\r\nlast to this day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Whitefield.]\r\n\r\nWhitefield was not so learned, or intellectual as Wesley. He was not\r\nso great a genius. But he had more eloquence, and more warmth of\r\ndisposition. Wesley was a system maker, a metaphysician, a logician.\r\nHe was also profoundly versed in the knowledge of human nature, and\r\ncuriously adapted his system to the wants and circumstances of that\r\nclass of people over whom he had the greatest power. Both Wesley and\r\nWhitefield were demanded by their times, and only such men as they\r\nwere could have succeeded. They were reproached for their\r\nextravagances, and for a zeal which was confounded with fanaticism;\r\nbut, had they been more proper, more prudent, more yielding to the\r\nprejudices of the great, they would not have effected so much good for\r\ntheir country. So with Luther. Had he possessed a severer taste, had\r\nhe been more of a gentleman, or more of a philosopher, or even more\r\nhumble, he would not so signally have succeeded. Germany, and the\r\ncircumstances of the age, required a rough, practical, bold, impetuous\r\nreformer to lead a movement against dignitaries and venerable\r\ncorruptions. England, in the eighteenth century, needed a man to\r\narouse the common people to a sense of their spiritual condition; a\r\nman who would not be trammelled by his church; who would not be\r\ngoverned by the principles of expediency; who would trust in God, and\r\nlabor under peculiar discouragement and self-denial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Institution of Wesley.]\r\n\r\nWesley was like Luther in another respect. He quarrelled with those\r\nwho would not conform to all his views, whether they had been friends\r\nor foes. He had been attracted by the Moravians. Their simplicity,\r\nfervor, and sedateness had won his regard. But when the Moravians\r\nmaintained that there was delusion in those ravings which Wesley\r\nconsidered as the work of grace, when they asserted that sin would\r\nremain with even regenerated man until death, and that it was in vain\r\nto expect the purification of the soul by works of self-denial, Wesley\r\nopposed them, and slandered them. He also entered the lists against\r\nhis friend and fellow-laborer, Whitefield. The latter did not agree\r\nwith him respecting perfection, nor election, nor predestination; and,\r\nwhen this disagreement had become fixed, an alienation took place,\r\nsucceeded by actual bitterness and hostility. Wesley, however, in his\r\nlatter days, manifested greater charity and liberality, and was a\r\nmodel of patience and gentleness. He became finally reconciled to\r\nWhitefield, and the union continued until the death of the latter, at\r\nNewburyport, in 1770.\r\n\r\nThe greatness of Wesley consisted in devising that wonderful church\r\npolity which still governs the powerful and numerous sect which he\r\nfounded. It is from the system of the Methodists, rather than from\r\ntheir theological opinions, that their society spread so rapidly over\r\nGreat Britain and America, and which numbered at his death,\r\nseventy-one thousand persons in England, and forty-eight thousand in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nAnd yet his institution was not wholly a matter of calculation, but\r\nwas gradually developed as circumstances arose. When contributions\r\nwere made towards building a meeting-house in Bristol, it was observed\r\nthat most of the brethren were poor, and could afford but little. Then\r\nsaid one of the number, "Put eleven of the poorest with me, and if\r\nthey give any thing, it is well. I will call on each of them weekly,\r\nand if they give nothing, I will give for them as well as for myself."\r\nThis suggested the idea of a system of supervision. In the course of\r\nthe weekly calls, the persons who had undertaken for a class\r\ndiscovered some irregularities among those for whose contributions\r\nthey were responsible, and reported them to Wesley. He saw, at once,\r\nthe advantage to be derived from such an arrangement. It was what he\r\nhad long desired. He called together the leaders, and desired that\r\neach should make a particular inquiry into the behavior of all under\r\ntheir respective supervision. They did so. The custom was embraced by\r\nthe whole body, and became fundamental. But it was soon found to be\r\ninconvenient to visit each person separately in his own house weekly,\r\nand then it was determined that all the members of the class should\r\nassemble together weekly, when quarrels could be made up, and where\r\nthey might be mutually profited by each other\'s prayers and\r\nexhortations. Thus the system of classes and class-leaders arose,\r\nwhich bears the same relation to the society at large that town\r\nmeetings do to the state or general government in the American\r\ndemocracy--which, as it is known, constitute the genius of our\r\npolitical institutions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Itinerancy.]\r\n\r\nItinerancy also forms another great feature of Methodism; and this\r\nresulted from accident. But it is the prerogative and peculiarity of\r\ngenius to take advantage of accidents and circumstances. It cannot\r\ncreate them. Wesley had no church; but, being an ordained clergyman of\r\nthe Establishment, and a fellow of a college beside, he had the right\r\nto preach in any pulpit, and in any diocese. But the pulpits were\r\nclosed against him, in consequence of his peculiarities; so he\r\npreached wherever he could collect a congregation. Itinerancy and\r\npopularity gave him notoriety, and flattered ambition, of which he was\r\nnot wholly divested. He and his brethren wandered into every section\r\nof England, from the Northumbrian moorlands to the innermost depths of\r\nthe Cornish mines, in the most tumultuous cities and in the most\r\nunfrequented hamlets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Great Influence and Power of Wesley.]\r\n\r\nAs he was the father of the sect, all appointments were made by him,\r\nand, as he deserved respect and influence, the same became unbounded.\r\nWhen power was vested to an unlimited extent in his hands, and when\r\nthe society had become numerous and scattered over a great extent of\r\nterritory, he divided England into circuits, and each circuit had a\r\ncertain number of ministers appointed to it. But he held out no\r\nworldly rewards as lures. The conditions which he imposed were hard.\r\nThe clergy were to labor with patience and assiduity on a mean\r\npittance, with no hope of wealth or ease. Rewards were to be given\r\nthem by no earthly judge. The only recompense for toil and hunger was\r\nthat of the original apostles--the approval of their consciences and\r\nthe favor of Heaven.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the overbearing intolerance and despotism of the people,\r\nthe chapels were not owned by the congregation nor even vested in\r\ntrustees, but placed at the absolute disposal of Mr. Wesley and the\r\nconference.\r\n\r\nIf the rule of Wesley was not in accordance with democratic\r\nprinciples, still its perpetuation in the most zealous of democratic\r\ncommunities, and its escape, thus far, from the ordinary fate of all\r\nhuman institutions,--that of corruption and decay,--shows its\r\nremarkable wisdom, and also the great virtue of those who have\r\nadministered the affairs of the society. It effected, especially in\r\nEngland,--what the Established Church and the various form of\r\nDissenters could not do,--the religious renovation of the lower\r\nclasses; it met their wants; it stimulated their enthusiasm. And while\r\nMethodism promoted union and piety among the people, especially those\r\nwho were ignorant and poor, it did not undermine their loyalty or\r\nattachment to the political institutions of the country. Other\r\nDissenters were often hostile to the government, and have been\r\nimpatient under the evils which have afflicted England; but the\r\nMethodists, taught subordination to superiors and rulers, and have\r\never been patient, peaceful, and quiet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Lord Mahon\'s History should be particularly\r\n     read; also Coxe\'s Memoirs of Walpole.

It is, therefore, time to consider the history of\r\ncolonization, both in the East and West, and not only by the English,\r\nbut by the Spaniards, the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the French.\r\n\r\nThe first settlements in the new world by Europeans, and their\r\nconquests in the unknown regions of the old, were made chiefly in view\r\nof commercial advantages. The love of money, that root of all evil,\r\nwas overruled by Providence in the discovery of new worlds, and the\r\ndiffusion of European civilization in countries inhabited by savages,\r\nor worn-out Oriental races. But the mere ignoble love of gain was not\r\nthe only motive which incited the Europeans to navigate unknown oceans\r\nand colonize new continents. There was also another, and this was the\r\nspirit of enterprise, which magically aroused the European mind in the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Marco Polo, when he visited the\r\nEast; the Portuguese, when they doubled the Cape of Good Hope;\r\nColumbus, when he discovered America; and Magellan, when he entered\r\nthe South Sea, were moved by curiosity and love of science, more than\r\nby love of gold. But the vast wealth, which the newly-discovered\r\ncountries revealed, stimulated, in the breasts of the excited\r\nEuropeans, the powerful passions of ambition and avarice; and the\r\nneedy and grasping governments of Spain, Portugal, Holland, France,\r\nand England patronized adventurers to the new El Dorado, and furnished\r\nthem with ships and stores, in the hope of receiving a share of the\r\nprofits of their expedition. And they were not disappointed. Although\r\nmany disasters happened to the early navigators, still country after\r\ncountry was added to the possessions of European kings, and vast sums\r\nof gold and silver were melted into European coin. No conquests were\r\never more sudden, and brilliant than those of Cortez and Pizarro, nor\r\ndid wealth ever before so suddenly enrich the civilized world. But\r\nsudden and unlawful gains produced their natural fruit. All the worst\r\nevils which flow from extravagance, extortion, and pride prevailed in\r\nthe old world and the new; and those advantages and possessions, which\r\nhad been gained by enterprise, were turned into a curse, for no wealth\r\ncan balance the vices of avarice, injustice, and cruelty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish Conquests and Settlements.]\r\n\r\nThe most important of all the early settlements of America were made\r\nby the Spaniards. Their conquests were the most brilliant, and proved\r\nthe most worthless. The spirit which led to their conquests and\r\ncolonization was essentially that of avarice and ambition. It must,\r\nhowever, be admitted that religious zeal, in some instances, was the\r\nanimating principle of the adventurers and of those that patronized\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe first colony was established in Hispaniola, or, as it was\r\nafterwards called, St. Domingo, a short time after the discovery of\r\nAmerica by Columbus. The mines of the island were, at that period,\r\nvery productive, and the aggressive Spaniards soon compelled the\r\nunhappy natives to labor in them, under their governor, Juan Ponce de\r\nLeon. But Hispaniola was not sufficiently large or productive to\r\nsatisfy the cupidity of the governor, and Porto Rico was conquered and\r\nenslaved. Cuba also, in a few years, was added to the dominions of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nAt length, the Spaniards, who had explored the coasts of the Main\r\nland, prepared to invade and conquer the populous territories of\r\nMontezuma, Emperor of Mexico. The people whom he governed had attained\r\na considerable degree of civilization, having a regular government, a\r\nsystem of laws, and an established priesthood. They were not ignorant\r\nof the means of recording great events, and possessed considerable\r\nskill in many useful and ornamental arts. They were rich in gold and\r\nsilver, and their cities were ornamented with palaces and gardens. But\r\ntheir riches were irresistible objects of desire to the European\r\nadventurers, and, therefore, proved their misfortune. The story of\r\ntheir conquest by Fernando Cortez need not here be told; familiarized\r\nas are all readers and students with the exquisite and artistic\r\nnarrative of the great American historian, whose work and whose fame\r\ncan only perish with the language itself.\r\n\r\nAbout ten years after the conquest of Mexico, Pizarro landed in Peru,\r\nwhich country was soon added to the dominions of Philip\xc2\xa0II. And the\r\ngovernment of that country was even more oppressive and unjust than\r\nthat of Mexico. All Indians between the ages of fifteen and fifty were\r\ncompelled to work in the mines; and so dreadful was the forced labor,\r\nthat four out of five of those who worked in them were supposed to\r\nperish annually. There was no limit to Spanish rapacity and cruelty,\r\nand it was exercised over all the other countries which were\r\nsubdued--Chili, Florida, and the West India Islands.\r\n\r\nEnormous and unparalleled quantities of the precious metals were sent\r\nto Spain from the countries of the new world. But, from the first\r\ndiscovery of Peru and Mexico, the mother country declined in wealth\r\nand political importance. With the increase of gold, the price of\r\nlabor and of provision, and of all articles of manufacturing industry,\r\nalso increased, and nearly in the same ratio. The Spaniards were\r\ninsensible to this truth, and, instead of cultivating the soil or\r\nengaging in manufactures, were contented with the gold which came from\r\nthe colonies. This, for a while, enriched them; but it was soon\r\nscattered over all Christendom, and was exchanged for the necessities\r\nof life. Industry and art declined, and those countries alone were the\r\ngainers which produced those articles which Spain was obliged to\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Portuguese Discoveries.]\r\n\r\nPortugal soon rivalled Spain in the extent and richness of colonial\r\npossessions. Brazil was discovered in 1501, and, in about half a\r\ncentury after, was colonized. The native Brazilians, inferior in\r\ncivilization to the Mexicans and Peruvians, were still less able than\r\nthey to resist the arms of the Europeans. They were gradually subdued,\r\nand their beautiful and fertile country came into possession of the\r\nvictors. But the Portuguese also extended their empire in the East, as\r\nwell as in the West. After the discovery of a passage round the Cape\r\nof Good Hope by Vasco de Gama, the early navigators sought simply to\r\nbe enriched by commerce with the Indies. They found powerful rivals in\r\nthe Arabs, who had heretofore monopolized the trade. In order to\r\nsecure their commerce, and also to protect themselves against their\r\nrivals and enemies, the Portuguese, under the guidance of Albuquerque,\r\nprocured a grant of land in India, from one of the native princes.\r\nSoon after, Goa was reduced, and became the seat of government; and\r\nterritorial acquisition commenced, which, having been continued nearly\r\nthree centuries by the various European powers, is still progressive.\r\nIn about sixty years, the Portuguese had established a great empire in\r\nthe East, which included the coasts and islands of the Persian Gulf,\r\nthe whole Malabar and Coromandel coasts, the city of Malacca, and\r\nnumerous islands of the Indian Ocean. They had effected a settlement\r\nin China, obtained a free trade with the empire of Japan, and received\r\ntribute from the rich Islands of Ceylon, Java, and Sumatra.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Portuguese Settlements.]\r\n\r\nThe same moral effects happened to Portugal, from the possession of\r\nthe Indies, that the conquests of Cortez and Pizarro produced on\r\nSpain. Goa was the most depraved spot in the world: and the vices\r\nwhich wealth engendered, wherever the Europeans formed a settlement,\r\ncan now scarcely be believed. When Portugal fell under the dominion of\r\nPhilip\xc2\xa0II., the ruin of her settlements commenced. They were\r\nsupplanted by the Dutch, who were more moral, more united and\r\nenterprising, though they provoked, by their arrogance and injustice,\r\nthe hostility of the Eastern princes.\r\n\r\nThe conquests and settlements of the Dutch rapidly succeeded those of\r\nthe Portuguese. In 1595, Cornelius Houtman sailed, with a\r\nwell-provided fleet, for the land of gems and spices. A company was\r\nsoon incorporated, in Holland, for managing the Indian trade.\r\nSettlements were first made in the Moluccas Islands, which soon\r\nextended to the possession of the Island of Java, and to the complete\r\nmonopoly of the spice trade. The Dutch then gained possession of the\r\nIsland of Ceylon, which they retained until it was wrested from them\r\nby the English. But their empire was only maintained at a vast expense\r\nof blood and treasure; nor were they any exception to the other\r\nEuropean colonists and adventurers, in the indulgence of all those\r\nvices which degrade our nature.\r\n\r\nNeither the French nor the English made any important conquests in the\r\nEast, when compared with those of the Portuguese and Dutch. Nor did\r\ntheir acquisitions in America equal those of the Spaniards. But they\r\nwere more important in their ultimate results.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early English Enterprise.]\r\n\r\nEnglish enterprise was manifested shortly after the first voyage of\r\nColumbus. Henry\xc2\xa0VII. was sufficiently enlightened, envious, and\r\navaricious, to listen to the proposals of a Venetian, resident in\r\nBristol, by the name of Cabot; and, in 1495, he commissioned him to\r\nsail under the banner of England, to take possession of any new\r\ncountries he might discover. Accordingly, in about two years after,\r\nCabot, with his second son, Sebastian, embarked at Bristol, in one of\r\nthe king\'s ships, attended by four smaller vessels, equipped by the\r\nmerchants of that enterprising city.\r\n\r\nImpressed with the idea of Columbus, and other early navigators, that\r\nthe West India Islands were not far from the Indian continent, he\r\nconcluded that, if he steered in a more northerly direction, he should\r\nreach India by a shorter course than that pursued by the great\r\ndiscoverer. Accordingly, sailing in that course, he discovered\r\nNewfoundland and Prince Edwards\', and, soon after, the coast of North\r\nAmerica, along which he sailed, from Labrador to Virginia. But,\r\ndisappointed in not finding a westerly passage to India, he returned\r\nto England, without attempting, either by settlement or conquest, to\r\ngain a footing on the great continent which the English were the\r\nsecond to visit, of all the European nations.\r\n\r\nEngland was prevented, by various circumstances, from deriving\r\nimmediate advantage from the discovery. The unsettled state of the\r\ncountry; the distractions arising from the civil wars, and afterwards\r\nfrom the Reformation; the poverty of the people, and the sordid nature\r\nof the king,--were unfavorable to settlements which promised no\r\nimmediate advantage; and it was not until the reign of Elizabeth that\r\nany deliberate plans were made for the colonization of North America.\r\nThe voyages of Frobisher and Drake had aroused a spirit of adventure,\r\nif they had not gratified the thirst for gold.\r\n\r\nAmong those who felt an intense interest in the new world, was Sir\r\nHumphrey Gilbert, a man of enlarged views and intrepid boldness. He\r\nsecured from Elizabeth (1578) a liberal patent, and sailed, with a\r\nconsiderable body of adventurers, for the new world. But he took a too\r\nnortherly direction, and his largest vessel was shipwrecked on the\r\ncoast of Cape Breton. The enterprise from various causes, completely\r\nfailed, and the intrepid navigator lost his life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Walter Raleigh.]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the times raised up, however, a greater genius, and a\r\nmore accomplished adventurer, and no less a personage than Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh,--the favorite of the queen; one of the greatest scholars and\r\nthe most elegant courtier of the age; a soldier, a philosopher, and a\r\nstatesman. He obtained a patent, substantially the same as that which\r\nhad been bestowed on Gilbert. In 1584, Raleigh despatched two small\r\nexploring vessels, under the command of Amidas and Barlow, which\r\nseasonably arrived off the coast of North Carolina. From the favorable\r\nreport of the country and the people, a larger fleet, of seven ships,\r\nwas despatched to America, commanded by Sir Richard Grenville. But he\r\nwas diverted from his course by the prevailing passion for predatory\r\nenterprise, and hence only landed one hundred and eight men at\r\nRoanoke, (1585.) The government of this feeble band was intrusted to\r\nCaptain Lane. But the passion for gold led to a misunderstanding with\r\nthe natives. The colony became enfeebled and reduced, and the\r\nadventurers returned to England, (1586,) bringing with them some\r\nknowledge of the country, and also that singular weed, which rapidly\r\nenslaved the courtiers of Queen Elizabeth, and which soon became one\r\nof the great staple commodities in the trade of the civilized world.\r\nModern science has proved it to be a poison, and modern philanthropy\r\nhas lifted up its warning voice against the use of it. But when have\r\nmen, in their degeneracy, been governed by their reason? What logic\r\ncan break the power of habit, or counteract the seductive influences\r\nof those excitements which fill the mind with visionary hopes, and\r\nlull a tumultuous spirit into the repose of pleasant dreams and\r\noblivious joys? Sir Walter Raleigh, to his shame or his misfortune,\r\nwas among the first to patronize a custom which has proved more\r\ninjurious to civilized nations than even the use of opium itself,\r\nbecause it is more universal and more insidious.\r\n\r\nBut smoking was simply an amusement with him. He soon turned his\r\nthoughts to the re\xc3\xabstablishment of his colony. Even before the return\r\nof the company under Lane, Sir Richard Grenville had visited the\r\nRoanoke, with the necessary stores. But he arrived too late; the\r\ncolony was abandoned.\r\n\r\nBut nothing could abate the zeal of the most enterprising genius of\r\nthe age. In 1587, he despatched three more ships, under the command of\r\nCaptain White, who founded the city of Raleigh. But no better success\r\nattended the new band of colonists. White sailed for England, to\r\nsecure new supplies; and, when he returned, he found no traces of the\r\ncolony he had planted; and no subsequent ingenuity or labor has been\r\nable to discover the slightest vestige.\r\n\r\nThe patience of Raleigh was not wasted; but new objects occupied his\r\nmind, and he parted with his patent, which made him the proprietary of\r\na great part of the Southern States. Nor were there any new attempts\r\nat colonization until 1606, in the reign of James.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: London Company Incorporated.]\r\n\r\nThrough the influence of Sir Ferdinand Gorges, a man of great wealth;\r\nSir John Popham, lord chief justice of England; Richard Hakluyt, the\r\nhistorian; Bartholomew Gosnold, the navigator, and John Smith, the\r\nenthusiastic adventurer,--King James\xc2\xa0I. granted a royal charter to two\r\nrival companies, for the colonization of America. The first was\r\ncomposed of noblemen, gentlemen, and merchants, in and about London,\r\nwho had an exclusive right to occupy regions from thirty-four to\r\nthirty-eight degrees of north latitude. The other company, composed of\r\ngentlemen and merchants in the west of England, had assigned to them\r\nthe territory between forty-one and forty-five degrees. But only the\r\nfirst company succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe territory, appropriated to the London or southern colony,\r\npreserved the name which had been bestowed upon it during the reign of\r\nElizabeth,--Virginia. The colonists were authorized to transport, free\r\nof the custom-house, for the term of seven years, what arms and\r\nprovisions they required; and their children were permitted to enjoy\r\nthe same privileges and liberties, in the American settlements, that\r\nEnglishmen had at home. They had the right to search for mines, to\r\ncoin money, and, for twenty-one years, to impose duties, on vessels\r\ntrading to their harbors, for the benefit of the colony. But, after\r\nthis period, the duty was to be taken for the king, who also preserved\r\na control over both the councils established for the government of the\r\ncolony,--the one in England itself, and the other in Virginia; a\r\ncontrol inconsistent with those liberties which the colonists\r\nsubsequently asserted and secured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hardships of the Virginia Colony.]\r\n\r\nThe London Company promptly applied themselves to the settlement of\r\ntheir territories; and, on the 19th of December, 1606, a squadron of\r\nthree small vessels set sail for the new world; and, on May 13, 1607,\r\na company of one hundred and five men, without families, disembarked\r\nat Jamestown. This was the first permanent settlement in America by\r\nthe English. But great misfortunes afflicted them. Before September,\r\none half of the colonists had perished, and the other half were\r\nsuffering from famine, dissension, and fear. The president, Wingfield,\r\nattempted to embezzle the public stores, and escape to the West\r\nIndies. He was supplanted in his command by Ratcliffe, a man without\r\ncapacity. But a deliverer was raised up in the person of Captain John\r\nSmith, who extricated the suffering and discontented band from the\r\nevils which impended. He had been a traveller and a warrior; had\r\nvisited France, Italy, and Egypt; fought in Holland and Hungary; was\r\ntaken a prisoner of war in Wallachia, and sent as a slave to\r\nConstantinople. Removed to a fortress in the Crimea, and subjected to\r\nthe hardest tasks, he yet contrived to escape, and, after many perils,\r\nreached his native country. But greater hardships and dangers awaited\r\nhim in the new world, to which he was impelled by his adventurous\r\ncuriosity. He was surprised and taken by a party of hostile Indians,\r\nwhen on a tour of exploration, and would have been murdered, had it\r\nnot been for his remarkable presence of mind and singular sagacity,\r\nunited with the intercession of the famous Pocahontas, daughter of a\r\ngreat Indian chief, from whom some of the best families in Virginia\r\nare descended. It would be pleasant to detail the romantic incidents\r\nof this brief captivity; but our limits forbid. Smith, when he\r\nreturned to Jamestown, found his company reduced to forty men, and\r\nthey were discouraged and disheartened. Moreover, they were a\r\ndifferent class of men from those who colonized New England. They were\r\ngentlemen adventurers connected with aristocratic families, were\r\ngreedy for gold, and had neither the fortitude nor the habits\r\nrequisite for success. They were not accustomed to labor, at least\r\nwith the axe and plough. Smith earnestly wrote to the council of the\r\ncompany in England, to send carpenters, husbandmen, gardeners,\r\nfishermen, and blacksmiths, instead of "vagabond gentlemen and\r\ngoldsmiths." But he had to organize a colony with such materials as\r\navarice or adventurous curiosity had sent to America. And, in spite of\r\ndissensions and natural indolence, he succeeded in placing it on a\r\nfirm foundation; surveyed the Chesapeake Bay to the Susquehannah, and\r\nexplored the inlets of the majestic Potomac. But he was not permitted\r\nto complete the work which he had so beneficently begun. His\r\nadministration was unacceptable to the company in England, who cared\r\nvery little for the welfare of the infant colony, and only sought a\r\nprofitable investment of their capital. They were disappointed that\r\nmines of gold and silver had not been discovered, and that they\r\nthemselves had not become enriched. Even the substantial welfare of\r\nthe colony displeased them; for this diverted attention from the\r\npursuit of mineral wealth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New Charter of the London Company.]\r\n\r\nThe original patentees, therefore, sought to strengthen themselves by\r\nnew associates and a new charter. And a new charter was accordingly\r\ngranted to twenty-one peers, ninety-eight knights, and a great number\r\nof doctors, esquires, gentlemen, and merchants. The bounds of the\r\ncolony were enlarged, the council and offices in Virginia abolished,\r\nand the company in England empowered to nominate all officers in the\r\ncolony. Lord Delaware was appointed governor and captain-general of\r\nthe company, and a squadron of nine ships, with five hundred emigrants\r\nwere sent to Virginia. But these emigrants consisted, for the most\r\npart, of profligate young men, whom their aristocratic friends sent\r\naway to screen themselves from shame; broken down gentlemen, too lazy\r\nto work; and infamous dependants on powerful families. They threw the\r\nwhole colony into confusion, and provoked, by their aggression and\r\nfolly, the animosities of the Indians, whom Smith had appeased. The\r\nsettlement at Jamestown was abandoned to famine and confusion, and\r\nwould have been deserted had it not been for the timely arrival of\r\nLord Delaware, with ample supplies and new recruits. His\r\nadministration was wise and efficient, and he succeeded in restoring\r\norder, if he did not secure the wealth which was anticipated.\r\n\r\nIn 1612, the company obtained a third patent, by which all the islands\r\nwithin three hundred leagues of the Virginia shore were granted to the\r\npatentees, and by which a portion of the power heretofore vested in\r\nthe council was transferred to the whole company. The political rights\r\nof the colonists remained the same but they acquired gradually peace\r\nand tranquillity. Tobacco was extensively cultivated, and proved a\r\nmore fruitful source of wealth than mines of silver or gold.\r\n\r\nThe jealousy of arbitrary power, and impatience of liberty among the\r\nnew settlers, induced the Governor of Virginia, in 1619, to reinstate\r\nthem in the full possession of the rights of Englishmen; and he\r\naccordingly convoked a Provincial Assembly, the first ever held in\r\nAmerica, which consisted of the governor, the council, and a number of\r\nburgesses, elected by the eleven existing boroughs of the colony. The\r\ndeliberation and laws of this infant legislature were transmitted to\r\nEngland for approval; and so wise and judicious were these, that the\r\ncompany, soon after, approved and ratified the platform of what\r\ngradually ripened into the American representative system.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rapid Colonization.]\r\n\r\nThe guarantee of political rights led to a rapid colonization. "Men\r\nwere now willing to regard Virginia as their home. They fell to\r\nbuilding houses and planting corn." Women were induced to leave the\r\nparent country to become the wives of adventurous planters; and,\r\nduring the space of three years, thirty-five hundred persons, of both\r\nsexes, found their way to Virginia. In the year 1620, a Dutch ship,\r\nfrom the coast of Guinea, arrived in James River, and landed twenty\r\nnegroes for sale; and, as they were found more capable of enduring\r\nfatigue, in a southern climate, than the Europeans, they were\r\ncontinually imported, until a large proportion of the inhabitants of\r\nVirginia was composed of slaves. Thus was introduced, at this early\r\nperiod, that lasting system of injustice and cruelty which has proved\r\nalready an immeasurable misfortune to the country, as well as a\r\ndisgrace to the institutions of republican liberty, but which is\r\nlamented, in many instances, by no class with more sincerity than by\r\nthose who live by the produce of slave labor itself.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding year, which witnessed the importation of negroes,\r\nbeheld the cultivation of tobacco, which before the introduction of\r\ncotton, was the great staple of southern produce.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indian Warfare.]\r\n\r\nIn 1622, the long-suppressed enmity of the Indians broke out in a\r\nsavage attempt to murder the whole colony. A plot had been formed by\r\nwhich all the English settlements were to be attacked on the same day,\r\nand at the same hour. The conspiracy was betrayed by a friendly\r\nIndian, but not in time to prevent a fearful massacre of three hundred\r\nand forty-seven persons, among whom were some of the wealthiest and\r\nmost respectable inhabitants. Then followed all the evils of an Indian\r\nwar, and the settlements were reduced from eighty to eight\r\nplantations; and it was not until after a protracted struggle that the\r\ncolonists regained their prosperity.\r\n\r\nScarcely had hostilities with the Indians commenced, before\r\ndissensions among the company in England led to a quarrel with the\r\nking, and a final abrogation of their charter. The company was too\r\nlarge and too democratic. The members were dissatisfied that so little\r\ngain had been derived from the colony; and moreover they made their\r\ncourts or convocations, when they assembled to discuss colonial\r\nmatters, the scene of angry political debate. There was a court party\r\nand a country party, each inflamed with violent political animosities.\r\nThe country party was the stronger, and soon excited the jealousy of\r\nthe arbitrary monarch, who looked upon their meetings "as but a\r\nseminary to a seditious parliament." A royal board of commissioners\r\nwere appointed to examine the affairs of the company, who reported\r\nunfavorably; and the king therefore ordered the company to surrender\r\nits charter. The company refused to obey an arbitrary mandate; but\r\nupon its refusal, the king ordered a writ of _quo warranto_ to be\r\nissued, and the Court of the King\'s Bench decided, of course, in favor\r\nof the crown. The company was accordingly dissolved. But the\r\ndissolution, though arbitrary, operated beneficially on the colony. Of\r\nall cramping institutions, a sovereign company of merchants is the\r\nmost so, since they seek simply commercial gain, without any reference\r\nto the political, moral, or social improvement of the people whom they\r\nseek to control.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Governor Harvey.]\r\n\r\nBefore King James had completed his scheme for the government of the\r\ncolony, he died; and Charles\xc2\xa0I. pursued the same arbitrary policy\r\nwhich his father contemplated. He instituted a government which\r\ncombined the unlimited prerogative of an absolute prince with the\r\nnarrow and selfish maxims of a mercantile corporation. He monopolized\r\nthe profits of its trade, and empowered the new governor, whom he\r\nappointed, to exercise his authority with the most undisguised\r\nusurpation of those rights which the colonists had heretofore enjoyed.\r\nHarvey\'s disposition was congenial with the rapacious and cruel system\r\nwhich he pursued, and he acted more like the satrap of an Eastern\r\nprince than the representative of a constitutional monarch. The\r\ncolonists remonstrated and complained; but their appeals to the mercy\r\nand justice of the king were disregarded, and Harvey continued his\r\ncourse of insolence and tyranny until that famous parliament was\r\nassembled which rebelled against the folly and government of Charles.\r\nIn 1641, a new and upright governor, Sir William Berkeley, was sent to\r\nVirginia, and the old provincial liberties were restored. In the\r\ncontest between the king and parliament Virginia espoused the royal\r\ncause. When the parliament had triumphed over the king, Virginia was\r\nmade to feel the force of republican displeasure, and oppressive\r\nrestrictions were placed upon the trade of the colony, which were the\r\nmore provoking in view of the indulgence which the New England\r\ncolonies received from the protector. A revolt ensued, and Sir William\r\nBerkeley was forced from his retirement, and made to assume the\r\ngovernment of the rebellious province. Cromwell, fortunately for\r\nVirginia, but unfortunately for the world, died before the rebellion,\r\ncould be suppressed; and when Charles\xc2\xa0II. was restored, Virginia\r\njoyfully returned to her allegiance. The supremacy of the Church of\r\nEngland was established by law, stipends were allowed to her\r\nministers, and no clergymen were permitted to exercise their functions\r\nbut such as held to the supremacy of the Church of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arbitrary Policy of Charles\xc2\xa0II.]\r\n\r\nBut Charles\xc2\xa0II. was as incapable as his father of pursuing a generous\r\nand just policy to the colonies; and parliament itself looked upon the\r\ncolonies as a source of profit to the nation, rather than as a part of\r\nthe nation. No sooner was Charles seated on the throne, than\r\nparliament imposed a duty of five per cent. on all merchandise\r\nexported from, or imported into, any of the dominions belonging to the\r\ncrown; and the famous Navigation Act was passed, which ordained that\r\nno commodities should be imported into any of the British settlements\r\nbut in vessels built in England or in her colonies; and that no sugar,\r\ntobacco, cotton, wool, indigo and some other articles produced in the\r\ncolonies, should be shipped from them to any other country but\r\nEngland. As a compensation, the colonies were permitted the exclusive\r\ncultivation of tobacco. The parliament, soon after, in 1663, passed\r\nadditional restrictions; and, advancing, step by step, gradually\r\nsubjected the colonies to a most oppressive dependence on the mother\r\ncountry, and even went so far as to regulate the trade of the several\r\ncolonies with each other. This system of monopoly and exclusion, of\r\ncourse, produced indignation and disgust, and sowed the seeds of\r\nultimate rebellion. Indian hostilities were added to provincial\r\ndiscontent, and even the horrors of civil war disturbed the prosperity\r\nof the colony. An ambitious and unprincipled adventurer, by the name\r\nof Bacon, succeeded in fomenting dissension, and in successfully\r\nresisting the power of the governor. Providence arrested the career of\r\nthe rebel in the moment of his triumph; and his sickness and death\r\nfortunately dissipated the tempest which threatened to be fatal to the\r\npeace and welfare of Virginia. Berkeley, on the suppression of the\r\nrebellion, punished the offenders with a severity which ill accorded\r\nwith his lenient and pacific character. His course did not please the\r\ngovernment in England, and he was superseded by Colonel Jeffries. But\r\nhe died before his successor arrived. A succession of governors\r\nadministered the colony as their disposition prompted, some of whom\r\nwere wise and able, and others tyrannical and rapacious.\r\n\r\nThe English revolution of 1688 produced also a change in the\r\nadministration of the colony. Its dependence on the personal character\r\nof the sovereign was abolished, and its chartered liberties were\r\nprotected. The king continued to appoint the royal governor, and the\r\nparliament continued to oppress the trade of the colonists; but they,\r\non the whole, enjoyed the rights of freemen, and rapidly advanced in\r\nwealth and prosperity. On the accession of William and Mary, the\r\ncolony contained fifty thousand inhabitants and forty-eight parishes;\r\nand, in 1676, the customs on tobacco alone were collected in England\r\nto the amount of one hundred and thirty-five thousand pounds. The\r\npeople generally belonged to the Episcopal Church, and the clergy each\r\nreceived, in every parish, a house and glebe, together with sixteen\r\nthousand pounds of tobacco. The people were characterized for\r\nhospitality and urbanity, but were reproached for the indolence which\r\na residence in scattered villages, a hot climate, and negro slavery\r\nmust almost inevitably lead to. Literature, that solace of the refined\r\nand luxurious in the European world, was but imperfectly cultivated;\r\nnor was religion, in its stern and lofty developments, the animating\r\nprinciple of life, as in the New England settlements. But the people\r\nof Virginia were richer, more cultivated, and more aristocratic than\r\nthe Puritans, more refined in manners, and more pleasing as\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Settlement of New England.]\r\n\r\nThe settlements in New England were made by a very different class of\r\nmen from those who colonized Virginia. They were not adventurers in\r\nquest of gain; they were not broken-down gentlemen of aristocratic\r\nconnections; they were not the profligate and dissolute members of\r\npowerful families. They were Puritans, they belonged to the middle\r\nranks of society; they were men of stern and lofty virtue, of\r\ninvincible energy, and hard and iron wills; they detested both the\r\ncivil and religious despotism of their times, and desired, above all\r\nworldly consideration, the liberty of worshipping God according to the\r\ndictates of their consciences. They were chiefly Independents and\r\nCalvinists, among whom religion was a life, and not a dogma. They\r\nsought savage wilds, not for gain, not for ease, not for\r\naggrandizement, but for liberty of conscience; and, for the sake of\r\nthat inestimable privilege, they were ready to forego all the comforts\r\nand elegances of civilized life, and cheerfully meet all the dangers\r\nand make all the sacrifices which a residence among savage Indians,\r\nand in a cold and inhospitable climate, necessarily incurred.\r\n\r\nThe efforts at colonization attempted by the company in the west of\r\nEngland, to which allusion has been made, signally failed. God did not\r\ndesign that New England should be settled by a band of commercial\r\nadventurers. A colony was permanently planted at Plymouth, within the\r\nlimits of the corporation, of forty persons, to whom James had granted\r\nenormous powers, and a belt of country from the fortieth to the\r\nforty-eighth degree of north latitude in width, and from the Atlantic\r\nto the Pacific in length.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrival of the Mayflower.]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of August, 1620, the Mayflower and the Speedwell, freighted\r\nwith the first Puritan colony, set sail from Southampton. It composed\r\na band of religious and devoted men, with their wives and children,\r\nwho had previously sought shelter in Holland for the enjoyment of\r\ntheir religious opinions. The smaller vessel, after a trial on the\r\nAtlantic, was found incompetent to the voyage, and was abandoned. The\r\nmore timid were allowed to disembark at old Plymouth. One hundred and\r\none resolute souls again set sail in the Mayflower, for the unknown\r\nwilderness, with all its countless dangers and miseries. No common\r\nworldly interest could have sustained their souls. The first\r\nadventurers embarked for Virginia, without women or children; but the\r\nPuritans made preparation for a permanent residence. Providence,\r\nagainst their design, guided their little vessel to the desolate\r\nshores of the most barren part of Massachusetts. On the 9th of\r\nNovember, it was safely moored in the harbor of Cape Cod. On the 11th,\r\nthe colonists solemnly bound themselves into a body politic, and chose\r\nJohn Carver for their governor. On the 11th of December, (O. S.,)\r\nafter protracted perils and sufferings, this little company landed on\r\nPlymouth Rock. Before the opening spring, more than half the colony\r\nhad perished from privation, fatigue, and suffering, among whom was\r\nthe governor himself. In the autumn, their numbers were recruited; but\r\nall the miseries of famine remained. They lived together as a\r\ncommunity; but, for three or four months together, they had no corn\r\nwhatever. In the spring of 1623, each family planted for itself, and\r\nland was assigned to each person in perpetual fee. The needy and\r\ndefenceless colonists were fortunately preserved from the hostility of\r\nthe natives, since a famine had swept away the more dangerous of their\r\nsavage neighbors; nor did hostilities commence for several years. God\r\nprotected the Pilgrims, in their weakness, from the murderous\r\ntomahawk, and from the perils of the wilderness. They suffered, but\r\nthey existed. Their numbers slowly increased, but they were all\r\nPuritans,--were just the men to colonize the land, and lay the\r\nfoundation of a great empire. From the beginning, a strict democracy\r\nexisted, and all enjoyed ample exemption from the trammels of\r\narbitrary power. No king took cognizance of their existence, or\r\nimposed upon them a despotic governor. They appointed their own\r\nrulers, and those rulers governed in the fear of God. Township\r\nindependence existed from the first; and this is the nursery and the\r\ngenius of American institutions. The Plymouth colony was a\r\nself-constituted democracy; but it was composed of Englishmen, who\r\nloved their native land, and, while they sought unrestrained freedom,\r\ndid not disdain dependence on the mother country, and a proper\r\nconnection with the English government. They could not obtain a royal\r\ncharter from the king; but the Grand Council of Plymouth--a new\r\ncompany, to which James had given the privileges of the old\r\none--granted all the privileges which the colonists desired. They were\r\ntoo insignificant to attract much attention from the government, or\r\nexcite the jealousy of a great corporation.\r\n\r\nUnobtrusive and unfettered, the colony slowly spread. But wherever it\r\nspread, it took root. It was a tree which Providence planted for all\r\ngenerations. It was established upon a rock. It was a branch of the\r\ntrue church, which was destined to defy storms and changes, because\r\nits strength was in the Lord.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Settlement of New Hampshire.]\r\n\r\nBut all parts of New England were not, at first, settled by Puritan\r\nPilgrims, or from motives of religion merely. The council of Plymouth\r\nissued grants of domains to various adventurers, who were animated by\r\nthe spirit of gain. John Mason received a patent for what is now the\r\nstate of New Hampshire. Portsmouth and Dover had an existence as early\r\nas 1623. Gorges obtained a grant of the whole district between the\r\nPiscataqua and the Kennebec. Saco, in 1636, contained one hundred and\r\nfifty people. But the settlements in New Hampshire and Maine, having\r\ndisappointed the expectations of the patentees in regard to emolument\r\nand profit, were not very flourishing.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, a new company of Puritans was formed for the\r\nsettlement of the country around Boston. The company obtained a royal\r\ncharter, (1629,) which constituted them a body politic, by the name of\r\nthe _Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay_. It conferred on\r\nthe colonists the rights of English subjects, although it did not\r\ntechnically concede freedom of religious worship, or the privilege of\r\nself-government. The main body of the colonists settled in Salem. They\r\nwere a band of devout and lofty characters; Calvinists in their\r\nreligious creed, and republicans in their political opinions. Strict\r\nindependency was the basis and the genius of their church. It was\r\nself-constituted, and all its officers were elected by the members.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constitution of the Colony.]\r\n\r\nThe charter of the company had been granted to a corporation\r\nconsisting chiefly of merchants resident in London, and was more\r\nliberal than could have been expected from so bigoted and zealous a\r\nking as Charles\xc2\xa0I. If it did not directly concede the rights of\r\nconscience, it seemed to be silent respecting them; and the colonists\r\nwere left to the unrestricted enjoyment of their religious and civil\r\nliberties. The intolerance and rigor of Archbishop Laud caused this\r\nnew colony to be rapidly settled; and, as many distinguished men\r\ndesired to emigrate, they sought and secured, from the company in\r\nEngland, a transfer of all the powers of government to the actual\r\nsettlers in America. By this singular transaction, the municipal\r\nrights and privileges of the colonists were established on a firm\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nIn 1630, not far from fifteen hundred persons, with Winthrop as their\r\nleader and governor, emigrated to the new world, and settled first in\r\nCharlestown, and afterwards in Boston. In accordance with the charter\r\nwhich gave them such unexpected privileges, a General Court was\r\nassembled, to settle the government. But the privilege of the elective\r\nfranchise was given only to the members of the church, and each church\r\nwas formed after the model of the one in Salem. It cannot be said that\r\na strict democracy was established, since church membership was the\r\ncondition of the full enjoyment of political rights. But if the\r\nconstitution was somewhat aristocratic and exclusive, aristocracy was\r\nnot based on wealth or intellect. The Calvinists of Massachusetts\r\nrecognized a government of the elect,--a sort of theocracy, in which\r\nonly the religious, or those who professed to be so, and were admitted\r\nto be so, had a right to rule. This was the notion of Cromwell\r\nhimself, the great idol and representative of the Independents, who\r\nfancied that the government of England should be intrusted only to\r\nthose who were capable of saving England, and were worthy to rule\r\nEngland. As his party constituted, in his eyes, this elect body, and\r\nwas, in reality, the best party,--composed of men who feared God, and\r\nwere willing to be ruled by his laws,--therefore his party, as he\r\nsupposed, had a right to overturn thrones, and establish a new\r\ntheocracy on earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Doctrines of the Puritans.]\r\n\r\nThis notion was a delusion in England, and proved fatal to all those\r\nwho were blinded by it. Not so in America. Amid the unbroken forests\r\nof New England, a colony of men was planted who generally recognized\r\nthe principles of Cromwell; and one of the best governments the world\r\nhas seen controlled the turbulent, rewarded the upright, and protected\r\nthe rights and property of all classes with almost paternal fidelity\r\nand justice. The colony, however,--such is the weakness of man, such\r\nthe degeneracy of his nature,--was doomed to dissension. Bigotry, from\r\nwhich no communities or individuals are fully free, drove some of the\r\nbest men from the limits of the colony. Roger Williams, a minister in\r\nSalem, and one of the most worthy and enlightened men of his age,\r\nsought shelter from the persecution of his brethren amid the wilds on\r\nNarragansett Bay. In June, 1636, the lawgiver of Rhode Island, with\r\nfive companions, embarked in an Indian canoe, and, sailing down the\r\nriver, landed near a spring, on a sheltered spot, which he called\r\n_Providence_. He was gradually joined by others, who sympathized with\r\nhis tolerant spirit and enlightened views, and the colony of Rhode\r\nIsland became an asylum for the persecuted for many years. And there\r\nwere many such. The Puritans were too earnest to live in harmony with\r\nthose who differed from them on great religious questions; and a\r\ndifference of views must have been expected among men so intellectual,\r\nso acute, and so fearless in speculation. How could dissenters from\r\nprevailing opinions fail to arise?--mystics, fanatics, and heretics?\r\nThe idea of special divine illumination--ever the prevailing source of\r\nfanaticism, in all ages and countries--led astray some; and the desire\r\nfor greater spiritual liberty animated others. Anne Hutchinson adopted\r\nsubstantially the doctrine of George Fox, that the spirit of God\r\nilluminates believers, independently of his written word; and she\r\ncommunicated her views to many others, who became, like her, arrogant\r\nand conceited, in spite of their many excellent qualities. Harry Vane,\r\nthe governor, was among the number. But there was no reasoning with\r\nfanatics, who fancied themselves especially inspired; and, as they\r\ndisturbed the peace of the colony, the leaders were expelled. Vane\r\nhimself returned to England, to mingle in scenes more congenial with\r\nhis excellent but excitable temper. In England, this illustrious\r\nfriend of Milton greatly distinguished himself for his efforts in the\r\ncause of liberty, and ever remained its consistent advocate; opposing\r\nequally the tyranny of the king, and the encroachments of those who\r\noverturned his throne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pequod War.]\r\n\r\nConnecticut, though assigned to a company in England, was early\r\ncolonized by a detachment of Pilgrims from Massachusetts. In 1635,\r\nsettlements were made at Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield. The\r\nfollowing year, the excellent and illustrious Hooker led a company of\r\none hundred persons through the forests to the delightful banks of the\r\nConnecticut, whose rich alluvial soil promised an easier support than\r\nthe hard and stony land in the vicinity of Boston. They were scarcely\r\nsettled before the Pequod war commenced, which involved all the\r\ncolonies in a desperate and bloody contest with the Indians. But the\r\nPequods were no match for Europeans, especially without firearms; and,\r\nin 1637, the tribe was nearly annihilated. The energy and severity\r\nexercised by the colonists, fighting for their homes, struck awe in\r\nthe minds of the savages; and it was long before they had the courage\r\nto rally a second time. The Puritans had the spirit of Cromwell, and\r\nnever hesitated to act with intrepid boldness and courage, when the\r\nnecessity was laid upon them. They were no advocates of half measures.\r\nTheir subsequent security and growth are, in no slight degree, to be\r\ntraced to these rigorous measures,--measures which, in these times,\r\nare sometimes denounced as too severe, but the wisdom of which can\r\nscarcely be questioned when the results are considered. All the great\r\nmasters of war, and of war with barbarians, have pursued a policy of\r\nunmitigated severity; and when a temporizing or timid course has been\r\nadopted with men incapable of being governed by reason, and animated\r\nby savage passions, that course has failed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Union of the New England Colonies.]\r\n\r\nAfter the various colonies were well established in New England, and\r\nmore than twenty thousand had emigrated from the mother country, they\r\nwere no longer regarded with benevolent interest by the king or his\r\nministers. The Grand Council of Plymouth surrendered its charter to\r\nthe king, and a writ of _quo warranto_ was issued against the\r\nMassachusetts colony. But the Puritans refused to surrender their\r\ncharter, and prepared for resistance against the malignant scheme of\r\nStrafford and Laud. Before they could be carried into execution, the\r\nstruggle between the king and the Long Parliament had commenced. The\r\nless resistance was forgotten in the greater. The colonies escaped the\r\nvengeance of a bigoted government. When the parliament triumphed, they\r\nwere especially favored, and gradually acquired wealth and power. The\r\ndifferent colonies formed a confederation to protect themselves\r\nagainst the Dutch and French on the one side, and the Indians on the\r\nother. And this happily continued for half a century, and was\r\nproductive of very important results. But the several colonies\r\ncontinued to make laws for their own people, to repress anarchy, and\r\nfavor the cause of religion and unity. They did not always exhibit a\r\nliberal and enlightened policy. They destroyed witches; persecuted the\r\nBaptists and Quakers, and excluded them from their settlements. But,\r\nwith the exception of religious persecution, their legislation was\r\nwise, and their general conduct was virtuous. They encouraged schools,\r\nand founded the University of Cambridge. They preserved the various\r\npeculiarities of Puritanism in regard to amusements, to the observance\r\nof the Sabbath, and to antipathy to any thing which reminded them of\r\nRome, or even of the Church of England. But Puritanism was not an\r\nodious crust, a form, a dogma. It was a life, a reality; and was not\r\nunfavorable to the development of the most beautiful virtues of\r\ncharity and benevolence, in a certain sphere. It was not a mere\r\ntraditional Puritanism, which clings with disgusting tenacity to a\r\nform, when the spirit of love has departed; but it was a harmonious\r\ndevelopment of living virtues, which sympathized with education, with\r\nfreedom, and with progress; which united men together by the bond of\r\nChristian love, and incited them to deeds of active benevolence and\r\nintrepid moral heroism. Nor did the Puritan Pilgrims persecute those\r\nwho did not harmonize with them in order to punish them, but simply to\r\nprotect themselves, and to preserve in their midst, and in their\r\noriginal purity, those institutions and those rights, for the\r\npossession of which they left their beloved native land for a savage\r\nwilderness, with its countless perils and miseries. But their\r\nhardships and afflictions were not of long continuance. With energy,\r\nindustry, frugality, and love, they soon obtained security, comfort,\r\nand health. And it is no vain and idle imagination which assigns to\r\nthose years, which succeeded the successful planting of the colony,\r\nthe period of the greatest happiness and virtue which New England has\r\never enjoyed.\r\n\r\nEqually fortunate with the Puritans were those interesting people who\r\nsettled Pennsylvania. If the Quakers were persecuted in the mother\r\ncountry and in New England, they found a shelter on the banks of the\r\nDelaware. There they obtained and enjoyed that freedom of religious\r\nworship which had been denied to the great founder of the sect, and\r\nwhich had even been withheld from them by men who had struggled with\r\nthem for the attainment of this exalted privilege.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William Penn.]\r\n\r\nIn 1677, the Quakers obtained a charter which recognized the principle\r\nof democratic equality in the settlements in West Jersey; and in 1680,\r\nWilliam Penn received from the king, who was indebted to his father, a\r\ngrant of an extensive territory, which was called _Pennsylvania_, of\r\nwhich he was constituted absolute proprietary. He also received a\r\nliberal charter, and gave his people privileges and a code of laws\r\nwhich exceeded in liberality any that had as yet been bestowed on any\r\ncommunity. In 1682 he landed at Newcastle, and, soon after, at his new\r\ncity on the banks of the Delaware, under the shelter of a large,\r\nspreading elm, made his immortal treaty with the Indians. He\r\nproclaimed to the Indian, heretofore deemed a foe never to be\r\nappeased, the principles of love which animated Fox, and which "Mary\r\nFisher had borne to the Grand Turk." "We meet," said the lawgiver, "on\r\nthe broad pathway of good faith and good will. No advantage shall be\r\ntaken on either side, but all shall be openness and love. I will not\r\ncall you children, for parents sometimes chide their children too\r\nseverely; nor brothers only, for brothers differ. The friendship\r\nbetween me and you I will not compare to a chain, for that the rains\r\nmight rust, or the felling tree might break. We are the same as if one\r\nman\'s body were to be divided into two parts; we are all one flesh and\r\nblood."\r\n\r\nSuch were the sublime doctrines which the illustrious founder of\r\nPennsylvania declared to the Indians, and which he made the basis of\r\nhis government, and the rule of his intercourse with his own people\r\nand with savage tribes. These doctrines were already instilled into\r\nthe minds of the settlers, and they also found a response in the souls\r\nof the Indians. The sons of the wilderness long cherished the\r\nrecollection of the covenant, and never forgot its principles. While\r\nall the other settlements of the Europeans were suffering from the\r\nhostility of the red man, Pennsylvania alone enjoyed repose. "Not a\r\ndrop of Quaker blood was ever shed by an Indian."\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn, although the absolute proprietor of a tract of country\r\nwhich was nearly equal in extent to England, sought no revenue and no\r\narbitrary power. He gave to the settlers the right to choose their own\r\nmagistrates, from the highest to the lowest, and only reserved to\r\nhimself the power to veto the bills of the council--the privilege\r\nwhich our democracies still allow to their governors.\r\n\r\nSuch a colony as he instituted could not but prosper. Its rising\r\nglories were proclaimed in every country of Europe, and the needy and\r\ndistressed of all countries sought this realized Utopia. In two years\r\nafter Philadelphia was settled, it contained six hundred houses. Peace\r\nwas uninterrupted, and the settlement spread more rapidly than in any\r\nother part of North America.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey, Maryland, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, were all\r\ncolonized by the English, shortly after the settlement of Virginia and\r\nNew England, either by emigration from England, or from the other\r\ncolonies. But there was nothing in their early history sufficiently\r\nmarked to warrant a more extended sketch. In general, the Southern\r\nStates were colonized by men who had not the religious elevation of\r\nthe Puritans, nor the living charity of the Quakers. But their\r\ncharacters improved by encountering the evils to which they were\r\nsubjected, and they became gradually imbued with those principles\r\nwhich in after times secured independence and union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Settlement of New York.]\r\n\r\nThe settlement of New York, however, merits a passing notice, since it\r\nwas colonized by emigrants from Holland, which was by far the most\r\nflourishing commercial state of Europe in the seventeenth century. The\r\nHudson River had been discovered (1609) by an Englishman, whose name\r\nit bears, but who was in the service of the Dutch East India Company.\r\nThe right of possession of the country around it was therefore claimed\r\nby the United Provinces, and an association of Dutch merchants fitted\r\nout a ship to trade with the Indians. In 1614, a rude fort was erected\r\non Manhattan Island, and, the next year, the settlement at Albany\r\ncommenced, chiefly with a view of trading with the Indians. In 1623,\r\nNew Amsterdam, now New York, was built for the purpose of\r\ncolonization, and extensive territories were appropriated by the Dutch\r\nfor the rising colony. This appropriation involved them in constant\r\ncontention with the English, as well as with the Indians; nor was\r\nthere the enjoyment of political privileges by the people, as in the\r\nNew England colonies. The settlements resembled lordships in the\r\nNetherlands, and every one who planted a colony of fifty souls,\r\npossessed the absolute property of the lands he colonized, and became\r\n_Patroon_, or Lord of the Manor. Very little attention was given to\r\neducation, and the colonists were not permitted to make cotton,\r\nwoollen, or linen cloth, for fear of injury to the monopolists of the\r\nDutch manufactures. The province had no popular freedom, and no public\r\nspirit. The poor were numerous, and the people were disinclined to\r\nmake proper provision for their own protection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conquest of New Netherlands.]\r\n\r\nBut the colony of the New Netherlands was not destined to remain under\r\nthe government of the Dutch West India Company. It was conquered by\r\nthe English in 1664, and the conquerors promised security to the\r\ncustoms, the religion, the institutions, and the possessions of the\r\nDutch; and this promise was observed. In 1673, the colony was\r\nreconquered, but finally, in 1674, was ceded to the English, and the\r\nbrother of Charles\xc2\xa0II. resumed his possession and government of New\r\nYork, and delegated his power to Colonel Nichols, who ruled with\r\nwisdom and humanity. But the old Dutch Governor Stuyvesant remained in\r\nthe city over which he had so honorably presided, and prolonged the\r\nempire of Dutch manners, if not of Dutch arms. The banks of the Hudson\r\ncontinued also to be peopled by the countrymen of the original\r\ncolonists, who long preserved the language, customs, and religion of\r\nHolland. New York, nevertheless, was a royal province, and the\r\nadministration was frequently intrusted to rapacious, unprincipled,\r\nand arbitrary governors.\r\n\r\nThus were the various states which border on the Atlantic Ocean\r\ncolonized, in which English laws, institutions, and language were\r\ndestined to be perpetuated. In 1688, the various colonies, of which\r\nthere were twelve, contained about two hundred thousand inhabitants;\r\nand all of these were Protestants; all cherished the principles of\r\ncivil and religious liberty, and sought, by industry, frugality and\r\npatience, to secure independence and prosperity. From that period to\r\nthis, no nation has grown more rapidly; no one has ever developed more\r\nsurprising energies; no one has ever enjoyed greater social,\r\npolitical, and religious privileges.\r\n\r\nBut the shores of North America were not colonized merely by the\r\nEnglish. On the banks of the St. Lawrence and Mississippi another body\r\nof colonists arrived, and introduced customs and institutions equally\r\nforeign to those of the English and Spaniards. The French settlements\r\nin Canada and Louisiana are now to be considered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discovery of the St. Lawrence.]\r\n\r\nWithin seven years from the discovery of the continent, the fisheries\r\nof Newfoundland were known to French adventurers. The St. Lawrence was\r\nexplored in 1506, and plans of colonization were formed in 1518. In\r\n1534, James Cartier, a native of St. Malo, sailed up the River St.\r\nLawrence; but the severity of the climate in winter prevented an\r\nimmediate settlement. It was not until 1603 that any permanent\r\ncolonization was commenced. Quebec was then selected by Samuel\r\nChamplain, the father of the French settlements in Canada, as the site\r\nfor a fort. In 1604, a charter was given, by Henry\xc2\xa0IV., to an eminent\r\nCalvinist, De Monts, which gave him the sovereignty of Acadia, a tract\r\nembraced between the fortieth and forty-sixth degrees of north\r\nlatitude. The Huguenot emigrants were to enjoy their religion, the\r\nmonopoly of the fur trade, and the exclusive control of the soil. They\r\narrived at Nova Scotia the same year, and settled in Port Royal.\r\n\r\nIn 1608, Quebec was settled by Champlain, who aimed at the glory of\r\nfounding a state; and in 1627 he succeeded in establishing the\r\nauthority of the French on the banks of the St. Lawrence. But\r\nChamplain was also a zealous Catholic, and esteemed the salvation of a\r\nsoul more than the conquest of a kingdom. He therefore selected\r\nFranciscan monks to effect the conversion of the Indians. But they\r\nwere soon supplanted by the Jesuits, who, patronized by the government\r\nin France, soon made the new world the scene of their strange\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jesuit Missionaries.]\r\n\r\nAt no period and in no country were Jesuit missionaries more untiring\r\nlaborers than amid the forests of North America. With the crucifix in\r\ntheir hands, they wandered about with savage tribes, and by\r\nunparalleled labors of charity and benevolence, sought to convert them\r\nto the Christianity of Rome. As early as 1635, a college and a\r\nhospital were founded, by munificent patrons in France, for the\r\nbenefit of all the tribes of red men from the waters of Lake Superior\r\nto the shores of the Kennebec. In 1641 Montreal, intended as a general\r\nrendezvous for converted Indians was occupied, and soon became the\r\nmost important station in Canada, next to the fortress of Quebec.\r\nBefore Eliot had preached to the Indians around Boston, the intrepid\r\nmissionaries of the Jesuits had explored the shores of Lake Superior,\r\nhad penetrated to the Falls of St. Mary\'s, and had visited the\r\nChippeways, the Hurons, the Iroquois, and the Mohawks. Soon after,\r\nthey approached the Dutch settlements on the Hudson, explored the\r\nsources of the Mississippi, examined its various tributary streams,\r\nand floated down its mighty waters to its mouth. The missionaries\r\nclaimed the territories on the Gulf of Mexico for the king of France,\r\nand in 1684, Louisiana was colonized by Frenchmen. The indefatigable\r\nLa Salle, after having explored the Mississippi, from the Falls of St.\r\nAnthony to the sea, was assassinated by one of his envious followers,\r\nbut not until he had earned the immortal fame of being the father of\r\nwestern colonization.\r\n\r\nThus were the North American settlements effected. In 1688, England\r\npossessed those colonies which border on the Atlantic Ocean, from\r\nMaine to Georgia. The French possessed Nova Scotia, Canada, Louisiana,\r\nand claimed the countries bordering on the Mississippi and its\r\nbranches, from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Superior, and also the\r\nterritories around the great lakes.\r\n\r\nA mutual jealousy, as was to be expected, sprung up between France and\r\nEngland respecting their colonial possessions. Both kingdoms aimed at\r\nthe sovereignty of North America. The French were entitled, perhaps,\r\nby right of discovery, to the greater extent of territory; but their\r\ncolonies were very unequal to those of the English in respect to\r\nnumbers, and still more so in moral elevation and intellectual\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nBut Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., then in the height of his power, meditated the\r\ncomplete subjection of the English settlements. The French allied\r\nthemselves with the Indians, and savage wars were the result. The\r\nMohawks and other tribes, encouraged by the French, committed fearful\r\nmassacres at Deerfield and Haverhill, and the English settlers were\r\nkept in a state of constant alarm and fear. By the treaty of Utrecht,\r\nin 1713, the colonists obtained peace and considerable accession of\r\nterritory. In 1720, John Law proposed his celebrated financial scheme\r\nto the prince regent of France, and the Mississippi Company was\r\nchartered, and Louisiana colonized. Much profit was expected to be\r\nderived from this company. It will be seen, in another chapter, how\r\nmiserably it failed. It was based on wrong foundations, and the\r\nproject of deriving wealth from the colonies came to nought; nor did\r\nit result in a rapid colonization.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prosperity of the English Colonies.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the English colonies advanced in wealth, numbers, and\r\npolitical importance, and attracted the notice of the English\r\ngovernment. Sir Robert Walpole, in 1711, was solicited to tax the\r\ncolonies; but he nobly rejected the proposal. He encouraged trade to\r\nthe utmost latitude, and tribute was only levied by means of\r\nconsumption of British manufactures. But restrictions were\r\nsubsequently imposed on colonial enterprise, which led to collisions\r\nbetween the colonies and the mother country. The Southern colonies\r\nwere more favored than the Northern, but all of them were regarded\r\nwith the view of promoting the peculiar interests of Great Britain.\r\nOther subjects of dispute also arose; but, nevertheless, the colonies,\r\nespecially those of New England, made rapid strides. There was a\r\ngeneral diffusion of knowledge, the laws were well observed, and the\r\nministers of religion were an honor to their sacred calling. The earth\r\nwas subdued, and replenished with a hardy and religious set of men.\r\nSentiments of patriotism and independence were ardently cherished. The\r\npeople were trained to protect themselves; and, in their town\r\nmeetings, learned to discuss political questions, and to understand\r\npolitical rights. Some ecclesiastical controversies disturbed the\r\npeace of parishes and communities, but did not retard the general\r\nprosperity. Some great lights also appeared. David Brainerd performed\r\nlabors of disinterestedness and enlightened piety, which have never\r\nbeen surpassed, and never equalled, even in zeal and activity, except\r\nby those of the earlier Jesuits. Jonathan Edwards stamped his genius\r\non the whole character of New England theology, and won the highest\r\nhonor as a metaphysician, even from European admirers. His treatise on\r\nthe Freedom of the Will has secured the praises of philosophers and\r\ndivines of all sects and parties from Hume to Chalmers, and can "never\r\nbe attentively perused without a sentiment of admiration at the\r\nstrength and stretch of the human understanding." Benjamin Franklin\r\nalso had arisen: he had not, at this early epoch, distinguished\r\nhimself for philosophical discoveries; but he had attracted attention\r\nas the editor of a newspaper, in which he fearlessly defended freedom\r\nof speech and the great rights of the people. But greater than\r\nFranklin, greater than any hero which modern history has commemorated,\r\nwas that young Virginia planter, who was then watching, with great\r\nsolicitude, the interests and glory of his country, and preparing\r\nhimself for the great conflicts which have given him immortality.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the colonies, and their great importance in the eyes of\r\nthe Europeans, had now provoked the jealousy of the two leading powers\r\nof Europe, and the colonial struggle between England and France began.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Encroachments.]\r\n\r\nThe French claimed the right of erecting a chain of fortresses along\r\nthe Ohio and the Mississippi, with a view to connect Canada with\r\nLouisiana, and thus obtain a monopoly of the fur trade with the\r\nIndians, and secure the possession of the finest part of the American\r\ncontinent. But these designs were displeasing to the English\r\ncolonists, who had already extended their settlements far into the\r\ninterior. The English ministry was also indignant in view of these\r\nmovements, by which the colonies were completely surrounded by\r\nmilitary posts. England protested; but the French artfully protracted\r\nnegotiations until the fortifications were completed.\r\n\r\nIt was to protest against the erection of these fortresses that George\r\nWashington, then twenty-three years of age, was sent by the colony of\r\nVirginia to the banks of the Ohio. That journey through the trackless\r\nwilderness, attended but by one person, in no slight degree marked him\r\nout, and prepared him for his subsequently great career.\r\n\r\nWhile the disputes about the forts were carried on between the\r\ncabinets of France and England, the French prosecuted their\r\nencroachments in America with great boldness, which doubtless hastened\r\nthe rupture between the two countries. Orders were sent to the\r\ncolonies to drive the French from their usurpations in Nova Scotia,\r\nand from their fortified posts upon the Ohio. Then commenced that\r\ngreat war, which resulted in the loss of the French possessions in\r\nAmerica. But this war was also allied with the contests which grew out\r\nof the Austrian Succession, and therefore will be presented in a\r\nseparate chapter on the Pelham administration, during which the Seven\r\nYears\' War, in the latter years of the reign of George\xc2\xa0II., commenced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: European Settlements in the East.]\r\n\r\nBut the colonial jealousy between England and France existed not\r\nmerely in view of the North American colonies, but also those in the\r\nEast Indies; and these must be alluded to in order to form a general\r\nidea of European colonization, and of the causes which led to the\r\nmercantile importance of Great Britain, as well as to the great wars\r\nwhich desolated the various European nations.\r\n\r\nFrom the difficulties in the American colonies, we turn to those,\r\ntherefore, which existed in the opposite quarter of the globe. Even to\r\nthose old countries had European armies penetrated; even there\r\nEuropean cupidity and enterprise were exercised.\r\n\r\nAs late as 1742, the territories of the English in India scarcely\r\nextended beyond the precincts of the towns in which were located the\r\nEast India Company\'s servants. The first English settlement of\r\nimportance was on the Island of Java; but, in 1658, a grant of land\r\nwas obtained on the Coromandel coast, near Madras, where was erected\r\nthe strong fortress of St. George. In 1668, the Island of Bombay was\r\nceded by the crown of Portugal to Charles\xc2\xa0II., and appointed the\r\ncapital of the British settlements in India. In 1698, the English had\r\na settlement on the Hooghly, which afterwards became the metropolis of\r\nBritish power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Settlements in India.]\r\n\r\nBut the Dutch, and Portuguese, and French had also colonies in India\r\nfor purposes of trade. Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. established a company, in imitation\r\nof the English, which sought a settlement on the Hooghly. The French\r\ncompany also had built a fort on the coast of the Carnatic, about\r\neighty miles south of Madras, called Pondicherry, and had colonized\r\ntwo fertile islands in the Indian Ocean, which they called the Isle of\r\nFrance and the Isle of Bourbon. The possessions of the French were\r\ncontrolled by two presidencies, one on the Isle of France, and the\r\nother at Pondicherry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: La Bourdonnais and Dupleix.]\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out between England and France, in 1744, these two\r\nFrench presidencies were ruled by two men of superior genius,--La\r\nBourdonnais and Dupleix,--both of them men of great experience in\r\nIndian affairs, and both devoted to the interests of the company, so\r\nfar as their own personal ambition would permit. When Commodore\r\nBurnet, with an English squadron, was sent into the Indian seas, La\r\nBourdonnais succeeded in fitting out an expedition to oppose it, and\r\neven contemplated the capture of Madras. No decisive action was fought\r\nat sea; but the French governor succeeded in taking Madras. This\r\nsuccess displeased the Nabob of the Carnatic, and he sent a letter to\r\nDupleix, and complained of the aggression of his countrymen in\r\nattacking a place under his protection. Dupleix, envious of the fame\r\nof La Bourdonnais, and not pleased with the terms of capitulation, as\r\nbeing too favorable to the English, claimed the right of annulling the\r\nconquest, since Madras, when taken, would fall under his own\r\npresidency.\r\n\r\nThe contentions between these two Frenchmen prevented La Bourdonnais\r\nfrom following up the advantage of his victory, and he failed in his\r\nattempts to engage the English fleet, and, in consequence, returned to\r\nFrance, and died from the effects of an unjust imprisonment in the\r\nBastile.\r\n\r\nDupleix, after the departure of La Bourdonnais, brought the principal\r\ninhabitants of Madras to Pondicherry. But some of them contrived to\r\nescape. Among them was the celebrated Clive, then a clerk in a\r\nmercantile house. He entered as an ensign into the company\'s service,\r\nand soon found occasion to distinguish himself.\r\n\r\nBut Dupleix, master of Madras, now formed the scheme of founding an\r\nIndian empire, and of expelling the English from the Carnatic. And\r\nIndia was in a state to favor his enterprises. The empire of the Great\r\nMogul, whose capital was Delhi, was tottering from decay. It had been,\r\nin the sixteenth century, the most powerful empire in the world. The\r\nmagnificence of his palaces astonished even Europeans accustomed to\r\nthe splendor of Paris and Versailles. His viceroys ruled over\r\nprovinces larger and richer than either France or England. And even\r\nthe lieutenants of these viceroys frequently aspired to independence.\r\n\r\nThe Nabob of Arcot was one of these latter princes. He hated the\r\nFrench, and befriended the English. On the death of the Viceroy of the\r\nDeccan, to whom he was subject, in 1748, Dupleix conceived his\r\ngigantic scheme of conquest. To the throne of this viceroy there were\r\nseveral claimants, two of whom applied to the French for assistance.\r\nThis was what the Frenchman desired, and he allied himself with the\r\npretenders. With the assistance of the French, Mirzappa Juy obtained\r\nthe viceroyalty. Dupleix was splendidly rewarded, and was intrusted\r\nwith the command of seven thousand Indian cavalry, and received a\r\npresent of two hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThe only place on the Carnatic which remained in possession of the\r\nrightful viceroy was Trichinopoly, and this was soon invested by the\r\nFrench and Indian forces.\r\n\r\nTo raise this siege, and turn the tide of French conquest, became the\r\nobject of Clive, then twenty-five years of age. He represented to his\r\nsuperior the importance of this post, and also of striking a decisive\r\nblow. He suggested the plan of an attack on Arcot itself, the\r\nresidence of the nabob. His project was approved, and he was placed at\r\nthe head of a force of three hundred sepoys and two hundred\r\nEnglishmen. The city was taken by surprise, and its capture induced\r\nthe nabob to relinquish the siege of Trichinopoly in order to retake\r\nhis capital. But Clive so intrenched his followers, that they\r\nsuccessfully defended the place after exhibiting prodigies of valor.\r\nThe fortune of war turned to the side of the gallant Englishman, and\r\nDupleix, who was no general, retreated before the victors. Clive\r\nobtained the command of Fort St. David, an important fortress near\r\nMadras, and soon controlled the Carnatic.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the settlements on the Hooghly were plundered by\r\nSuraj-w Dowlah, Viceroy of Bengal. Bengal was the most fertile and\r\npopulous province of the empire of the Great Mogul. It was watered by\r\nthe Ganges, the sacred river of India, and its cities were\r\nsurprisingly rich. Its capital was Moorshedabad, a city nearly as\r\nlarge as London; and here the young viceroy lived in luxury and\r\neffeminacy, and indulged in every species of cruelty and folly. He\r\nhated the English of Calcutta, and longed to plunder them. He\r\naccordingly seized the infant city, and shut up one hundred and forty\r\nof the colonists in a dungeon of the fort, a room twenty feet by\r\nfourteen, with only two small windows; and in a few hours, one hundred\r\nand seventeen of the English died. The horrors of that night have been\r\nsplendidly painted by Macaulay in his essay on Clive, and the place of\r\ntorment, called the _Black Hole of Calcutta_, is synonymous with\r\nsuffering and misery. Clive resolved to avenge this insult to his\r\ncountrymen. An expedition was fitted out at Madras to punish the\r\ninhuman nabob, consisting of nine hundred Europeans and fifteen\r\nhundred sepoys. It was a small force, but proved sufficient. Calcutta\r\nwas recovered and the army of the nabob was routed. Clive intrigued\r\nwith the enemies of the despot in his own city; and, by means of\r\nunparalleled treachery, dissimulation, art, and violence, Suraj-w\r\nDowlah was deposed, and Meer Jaffier, one of the conspirators, was\r\nmade nabob in his place. In return for the services of Clive, the new\r\nviceroy splendidly rewarded him. A hundred boats conveyed the\r\ntreasures of Bengal down the river to Calcutta. Clive himself, who had\r\nwalked between heaps of gold and silver, crowned with diamonds and\r\nrubies, condescended to receive a present of three hundred thousand\r\npounds. His moderation has been commended by his biographers in not\r\nasking for a million.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Meer Jaffier was, of course, displeasing to the\r\nimbecile Emperor of India, and a large army was sent to dethrone him.\r\nThe nabob appealed, in his necessity, to his allies, the English, and,\r\nwith the powerful assistance of the Europeans, the forces of the\r\nsuccessor of the great Aurungzebe were signally routed. But the great\r\nsums he was obliged to bestow on his allies, and the encroaching\r\nspirit which they manifested, changed his friendship into enmity. He\r\nplotted with the Dutch and the French to overturn the power of the\r\nEnglish. Clive divined his object, and Meer Jaffier was deposed in his\r\nturn. The Viceroy of Bengal was but the tool of his English\r\nprotectors, and British power was firmly planted in the centre of\r\nIndia. Calcutta became the capital of a great empire, and the East\r\nIndia Company, a mere assemblage of merchants and stockjobbers, by\r\ntheir system of perfidy, craft and violence, became the rulers and\r\ndisposers of provinces which Alexander had coveted in vain. The\r\nservants of this company made their fortunes, and untold wealth was\r\ntransported to England. Clive obtained a fortune of forty thousand\r\npounds a year, an Irish peerage, and a seat in the House of Commons.\r\nHe became an object of popular idolatry, courted by ministers, and\r\nextolled by Pitt. He was several times appointed governor-general of\r\nthe country he had conquered, and to him England is indebted for the\r\nfoundation of her power in India. But his fame and fortune finally\r\nexcited the jealousy of his countrymen, and he was made to bear the\r\nsins of the company which he had enriched. The malignity with which he\r\nwas pursued, and the disease which he acquired in India, operated\r\nunfortunately on a temper naturally irritable; his reason became\r\noverpowered, and he died, in 1774, by his own hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conquest of India.]\r\n\r\nThe subsequent career of Hastings, and final conquest of India, form\r\npart of the political history of England itself, during those\r\nadministrations which yet remain to be described. The colonization of\r\nAmerica and the East Indies now became involved with the politics of\r\nrival statesmen; and its history can only be appreciated by\r\nconsidering those acts and principles which marked the career of the\r\nNewcastles and the Pitts. The administration of the Pelhams,\r\ntherefore, next claims attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--The best histories pertaining to the conquests\r\n     of the Spaniards are undoubtedly those of Mr. Prescott.\r\n     Irving\'s Columbus should also be consulted.

And he was equal to the task, ruling, on the whole,\r\nbeneficently, promoting peace, regulating the finances, and\r\nencouraging those great branches of industry which lie at the\r\nfoundation of English wealth and power. But the intrigues of rival\r\npoliticians, and the natural desire of change, which all parties feel\r\nafter a long repose, plunged the nation into war, and forced the able\r\nminister to retire. The opposition, headed by the Prince of Wales,\r\nsupported by such able statesmen as Bolingbroke, Carteret,\r\nChesterfield, Pulteney, Windham, and Pitt, and sustained by the\r\nwritings of those great literary geniuses whom Walpole disdained and\r\nneglected, compelled George\xc2\xa0II., at last, to part with a man who had\r\nconquered his narrow prejudices.\r\n\r\nBut the Tories did not come into power on the retirement of Walpole.\r\nHis old confederates remained at the head of affairs, and Carteret,\r\nafterwards Lord Granville, the most brilliant man of his age, became\r\nthe leading minister. But even he, so great in debate, and so\r\ndistinguished for varied attainments, did not long retain his place.\r\nNone of the abuses which existed under the former administration were\r\nremoved; and moreover the war which the nation had clamored for, had\r\nproved disastrous. He also had to bear the consequences of Walpole\'s\r\ntemporizing policy which could no longer be averted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pelhams.]\r\n\r\nThe new ministry was headed by Henry Pelham, as first lord of the\r\ntreasury and chancellor of the exchequer, and by the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, as principal secretary of state. These two men formed,\r\nalso, a coalition with the leading members of both houses of\r\nparliament, Tories as well as Whigs; and, for the first time since the\r\naccession of the Stuarts, there was no opposition. This great\r\ncoalition was called the "Broad Bottom," and comprehended the Duke of\r\nBedford, the Earls of Chesterfield and Harrington, Lords Lyttleton and\r\nHardwicke, Sir Henry Cotton, Mr Doddington, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Fox, and Mr.\r\nMurray. The three latter statesmen were not then formidable.\r\n\r\nThe Pelhams were descended from one of the oldest, proudest and\r\nrichest families in England, and had an immense parliamentary\r\ninfluence from their aristocratic connections, their wealth, and their\r\nexperience. They were not remarkable for genius so much as for\r\nsagacity, tact, and intrigue. They were extremely ambitious, and fond\r\nof place and power. They ruled England as the representatives of the\r\naristocracy--the last administration which was able to defy the\r\nnational will. After their fall, the people had a greater voice in the\r\nappointment of ministers. Pitt and Fox were commoners in a different\r\nsense from what Walpole was, and represented that class which has ever\r\nsince ruled England,--not nobles, not the democracy, but a class\r\nbetween them, composed of the gentry, landed proprietors, lawyers,\r\nmerchants, manufacturers, men of leisure, and their dependants.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the Pelhams is chiefly memorable for the Scotch\r\nrebellion of 1745, and for the great European war which grew out of\r\ncolonial and commercial ambition, and the encroachments of Frederic\r\nthe Great.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pretender Charles Edward Stuart.]\r\n\r\nThe Scotch rebellion was produced by the attempts of the young\r\nPretender, Charles Edward Louis Philip Casimir Stuart, to regain the\r\nthrone of his ancestors. His adventures have the interest of romance,\r\nand have generally excited popular sympathy. He was born at Rome in\r\n1720; served, at the age of fifteen, under the Duke of Berwick, in\r\nSpain, and, at the age of twenty, received overtures from some\r\ndiscontented people of Scotland to head an insurrection. There was, at\r\nthis time, great public distress, and George\xc2\xa0II. was exceedingly\r\nunpopular. The Jacobites were powerful, and thousands wished for a\r\nchange, including many persons of rank and influence.\r\n\r\nWith only seven followers, in a small vessel, he landed on one of the\r\nWestern Islands, 18th of July, 1745. Even had the promises which had\r\nbeen made to him by France, or by people in Scotland, been fulfilled,\r\nhis enterprise would have been most hazardous. But, without money,\r\nmen, or arms, his hopes were desperate. Still he cherished that\r\npresumptuous self-confidence which so often passes for bravery, and\r\nsucceeded better than could have been anticipated. Several chieftains\r\nof the Highland clans joined his standard, and he had the faculty of\r\ngaining the hearts of his followers. At Borrodaile occurred his first\r\ninterview with the chivalrous Donald Cameron of Lochiel, who was\r\nperfectly persuaded of the desperate character of his enterprise, but\r\nnevertheless aided it with generous self-devotion.\r\n\r\nThe standard of Charles Edward was raised at Glenfinnan, on the 19th\r\nof August, and a little band of seven hundred adventurers and\r\nenthusiastic Highlanders resolved on the conquest of England! Never\r\nwas devotion to an unfortunate cause more romantic and sincere. Never\r\nwere energies more generously made, or more miserably directed. But\r\nthe first gush of enthusiasm and bravery was attended with success,\r\nand the Pretender soon found himself at the head of fifteen hundred\r\nmen, and on his way to Edinburgh, marching among people friendly to\r\nhis cause, whom he endeared by every attention and gentlemanly\r\nartifice. The simple people of the north of Scotland were won by his\r\nsmiles and courtesy, and were astonished at the exertions which the\r\nyoung prince made, and the fatigues he was able to endure.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of September, Charles had reached Linlithgow, only sixteen\r\nmiles from Edinburgh, where he was magnificently entertained in the\r\nancient and favorite palace of the kings of Scotland. Two days after,\r\nhe made his triumphal entry into the capital of his ancestors, the\r\nplace being unprepared for resistance. Colonel Gardiner, with his\r\nregiment of dragoons, was faithful to his trust, and the magistrates\r\nof Edinburgh did all in their power to prevent the surrender of the\r\ncity. But the great body of the citizens preferred to trust to the\r\nclemency of Charles, than run the risk of defence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surrender of Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nThus, without military stores, or pecuniary resources, or powerful\r\nfriends, simply by the power of persuasion, the Pretender, in the\r\nshort space of two months from his landing in Scotland, quietly took\r\npossession of the most powerful city of the north. The Jacobites put\r\nno restraint to their idolatrous homage, and the ladies welcomed the\r\nyoung and handsome chevalier with extravagant adulation. Even the\r\nWhigs pitied him, and permitted him to enjoy his brief hour of\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nAt Edinburgh, Charles received considerable re\xc3\xabnforcement, and took\r\nfrom the city one thousand stand of arms. He gave his followers but\r\nlittle time for repose, and soon advanced against the royal army\r\ncommanded by Sir John Cope. The two armies met at Preston Pans, and\r\nwere of nearly equal force. The attack was made by the invader, and\r\nwas impetuous and unlooked for. Nothing could stand before the\r\nenthusiasm and valor of the Highlanders, and in five minutes the rout\r\ncommenced, and a great slaughter of the regular army occurred. Among\r\nthose who fell was the distinguished Colonel Gardiner, an old veteran,\r\nwho refused to fly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Success of the Pretender.]\r\n\r\nCharles followed up his victory with moderation, and soon was master\r\nof all Scotland. He indulged his taste for festivities, at Holyrood,\r\nfor a while, and neglected no means to conciliate the Scotch. He\r\nflattered their prejudices, gave balls and banquets, made love to\r\ntheir most beautiful women, and denied no one access to his presence.\r\nPoets sang his praises, and women extolled his heroism and beauty. The\r\nlight, the gay, the romantic, and the adventurous were on his side;\r\nbut the substantial and wealthy classes were against him, for they\r\nknew he must be conquered in the end.\r\n\r\nStill his success had been remarkable, and for it he was indebted to\r\nthe Highlanders, who did not wish to make him king of England, but\r\nonly king of Scotland. But Charles deceived them. He wanted the\r\nsceptre of George\xc2\xa0II.; and when he commenced his march into England,\r\ntheir spirits flagged, and his cause became hopeless. There was one\r\nclass of men who were inflexibly hostile to him--the Presbyterian\r\nministers. They looked upon him, from the first, with coldness and\r\nharshness, and distrusted both his religion and sincerity. On them all\r\nhis arts, and flattery, and graces were lost; and they represented the\r\nsubstantial part of the Scottish nation. It is extremely doubtful\r\nwhether Charles could ever have held Edinburgh, even if English armies\r\nhad not been sent against him.\r\n\r\nBut Charles had played a desperate game from the beginning, for the\r\nsmall chance of winning a splendid prize. He, therefore, after resting\r\nhis troops, and collecting all the force he could, turned his face to\r\nEngland at the head of five thousand men, well armed and well clothed,\r\nbut discontented and dispirited. They had never contemplated the\r\ninvasion of England, but only the recovery of the ancient independence\r\nof Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Retreat of the Pretender.]\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of November, the Pretender set foot upon English soil, and\r\nentered Carlisle in triumph. But his forces, instead of increasing,\r\ndiminished, and no popular enthusiasm supported the courage of his\r\ntroops. But he advanced towards the south, and reached Derby\r\nunmolested on the 4th of December. There he learned that the royal\r\narmy, headed by the Duke of Cumberland, with twelve thousand veterans,\r\nwas advancing rapidly against him.\r\n\r\nHis followers clamored to return, and refused to advance another step.\r\nThey now fully perceived that success was not only hopeless, but that\r\nvictory would be of no advantage to them; that they would be\r\nsacrificed by a man who only aimed at the conquest of England.\r\n\r\nCharles was well aware of the desperate nature of the contest, but had\r\nno desire to retreat. His situation was not worse than what it had\r\nbeen when he landed on the Hebrides. Having penetrated to within one\r\nhundred and twenty miles of London, against the expectations of every\r\none, why should he not persevere? Some unlooked-for success, some\r\nlucky incidents, might restore him to the throne of his grandfather.\r\nBesides, a French army of ten thousand was about to land in England.\r\nThe Duke of Norfolk, the first nobleman in the country, was ready to\r\ndeclare in his favor. London was in commotion. A chance remained.\r\n\r\nBut his followers thought only of their homes, and Charles was obliged\r\nto yield to an irresistible necessity. Like Richard Coeur de Lion\r\nafter the surrender of Acre, he was compelled to return, without\r\nrealizing the fruit of bravery and success. Like the lion-hearted\r\nking, pensive and sad, sullen and miserable, he gave the order to\r\nretreat. His spirits, hitherto buoyant and gladsome, now fell, and\r\ndespondency and despair succeeded vivacity and hope. He abandoned\r\nhimself to grief and vexation, lingered behind his retreating army,\r\nand was reckless of his men and of their welfare. And well he may have\r\nbeen depressed. The motto of Hampden, "_Vestigia nulla retrorsum_,"\r\nhad also governed him. But others would not be animated by it, and he\r\nwas ruined.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Culloden.]\r\n\r\nBut his miserable and dejected army succeeded in reaching their native\r\nsoil, although pursued by the cavalry of two powerful armies, in the\r\nmidst of a hostile population, and amid great sufferings from hunger\r\nand fatigue. On the 26th of December, he entered Glasgow, levied a\r\ncontribution on the people, and prepared himself for his final battle.\r\nHe retreated to the Highlands, and spent the winter in recruiting his\r\ntroops, and in taking fortresses. On the 15th of April, 1746, he drew\r\nup his army on the moor of Culloden, near Inverness, with the\r\ndesperate resolution of attacking, with vastly inferior forces, the\r\nDuke of Cumberland, intrenched nine miles distant. The design was\r\nfoolish and unfortunate. It was early discovered; and the fresh troops\r\nof the royal duke attacked the dispirited, scattered, and wearied\r\nfollowers of Charles Edward before they could form themselves in\r\nbattle array. They defended themselves with valor. But what is valor\r\nagainst overwhelming force? The army of Charles was totally routed,\r\nand his hopes were blasted forever.\r\n\r\nThe most horrid barbarities and cruelties were inflicted by the\r\nvictors. The wounded were left to die. The castles of rebel chieftains\r\nwere razed to the ground. Herds and flocks were driven away, and the\r\npeople left to perish with hunger. Some of the captives were sent to\r\nBarbadoes, others were imprisoned, and many were shot. A reward of\r\nthirty thousand pounds was placed on the head of the Pretender; but he\r\nnevertheless escaped. After wandering a while as a fugitive,\r\ndisguised, wearied, and miserable, hunted from fortress to fortress,\r\nand from island to island, he succeeded, by means of the unparalleled\r\nloyalty and fidelity of his few Highland followers, in securing a\r\nvessel, and in escaping to France. His adventures among the Western\r\nIslands, especially those which happened while wandering, in the\r\ndisguise of a female servant, with Flora Macdonald, are highly\r\nromantic and wonderful. Equally wonderful is the fact that, of the\r\nmany to whom his secret was intrusted, not one was disposed to betray\r\nhim, even in view of so splendid a bribe as thirty thousand pounds.\r\nBut this fact, though surprising, is not inconceivable. Had Washington\r\nbeen unfortunate in his contest with the mother country, and had he\r\nwandered as a fugitive amid the mountains of Vermont, would not many\r\nAmericans have shielded him, even in view of a reward of one hundred\r\nthousand pounds?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Latter Days of the Pretender.]\r\n\r\nThe latter days of the Pretender were spent in Rome and Florence. He\r\nmarried a Polish princess, and assumed the title of _Duke of Albany_.\r\nHe never relinquished the hope of securing the English crown, and\r\nalways retained his politeness and grace of manner. But he became an\r\nobject of pity, not merely from his poverty and misfortunes, but also\r\nfrom the vice of intemperance, which he acquired in Scotland. He died\r\nof apoplexy, in 1788, and left no legitimate issue. The last male heir\r\nof the house of Stuart was the Cardinal of York, who died in 1807, and\r\nwho was buried in St. Peter\'s Cathedral; over whose mortal remains was\r\nerected a marble monument, by Canova, through the munificence of\r\nGeorge\xc2\xa0IV., to whom the cardinal had left the crown jewels which\r\nJames\xc2\xa0II. had carried with him to France. This monument bears the\r\nnames of James\xc2\xa0III., Charles\xc2\xa0III., and Henry\xc2\xa0IX., kings of England;\r\ntitles never admitted by the English. With the battle of Culloden\r\nexpired the hopes of the Catholics and Jacobites to restore\r\nCatholicism and the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nThe great European war, which was begun by Sir Robert Walpole, not\r\nlong before his retirement, was another great event which happened\r\nduring the administration of the Pelhams, and with which their\r\nadministration was connected. The Spanish war was followed by the war\r\nof the Austrian Succession.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maria Theresa.]\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa, Queen of Hungary, ascended the oldest and proudest\r\nthrone of Europe,--that of Germany,--amid a host of claimants. The\r\nElector of Bavaria laid claim to her hereditary dominions in Bohemia;\r\nthe King of Sardinia made pretension to the duchy of Milan; while the\r\nKings of Poland, Spain, France, and Prussia disputed with her her\r\nrights to the whole Austrian succession. Never were acts of gross\r\ninjustice meditated with greater audacity. Just as the young and\r\nbeautiful princess ascended the throne of Charlemagne, amid\r\nembarrassments and perplexities,--such as an exhausted treasury, a\r\nsmall army, a general scarcity, threatened hostilities with the Turks,\r\nand absolute war with France,--the new king of Prussia, Frederic,\r\nsurnamed the Great, availing himself of her distresses, seized one of\r\nthe finest provinces of her empire. The first notice which the queen\r\nhad of the seizure of Silesia, was an insulting speech from the\r\nPrussian ambassador. "I come," said he, "with safety for the house of\r\nAustria on the one hand, and the imperial crown for your royal\r\nhighness on the other. The troops of my master are at the service of\r\nthe queen, and cannot fail of being acceptable, at a time when she is\r\nin want of both. And as the king, my master, from the situation of his\r\ndominions, will be exposed to great danger from this alliance with the\r\nQueen of Hungary, it is hoped that, as an indemnification, the queen\r\nwill not offer him less than the whole duchy of Silesia."\r\n\r\nThe queen, of course, was indignant in view of this cool piece of\r\nvillany, and prepared to resist. War with all the continental powers\r\nwas the result. France joined the coalition to deprive the queen of\r\nher empire. Two French armies invaded Germany. The Elector of Bavaria\r\nmarched, with a hostile army, to within eight miles of Vienna. The\r\nKing of Prussia made himself master of Silesia. Abandoned by all her\r\nallies,--without an army, or ministers, or money,--the queen fled to\r\nHungary, her hereditary dominions, and threw herself on the generosity\r\nof her subjects. She invoked the states of the Diet, and, clad in deep\r\nmourning, with the crown of St. Stephen on her head, and a cimeter at\r\nher side, she traversed the hall in which her nobles were assembled,\r\nand addressed them, in the immortal language of Rome, respecting her\r\nwrongs and her distresses. Her faithful subjects responded to her\r\ncall; and youth, beauty, and rank, in distress, obtained their natural\r\ntriumph. "A thousand swords leaped from their scabbards," and the old\r\nhall rung with the cry, "We will die for our queen, Maria Theresa."\r\nTears started from the eyes of the queen, whom misfortunes and insult\r\ncould not bend, and called forth, even more than her words, the\r\nenthusiasm of her subjects.\r\n\r\nIt was in defence of this injured and noble queen that the English\r\nparliament voted supplies and raised armies. This was the war which\r\ncharacterized the Pelham administration, and to which Walpole was\r\nopposed. But it will be further presented, when allusion is made to\r\nFrederic the Great.\r\n\r\nFrance no sooner formed an alliance with Prussia, against Austria,\r\nthan the "balance of power" seemed to be disturbed. To restore this\r\nbalance, and preserve Austria, was the aim of England. To the desire\r\nto preserve this power may be traced most of the wars of the\r\neighteenth century. The idea of a balance of power was the leading\r\nprinciple which animated all the diplomatic transactions of Europe for\r\nmore than a century.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Breslau, (1742,) Maria Theresa yielded up to Frederic\r\nthe province of Silesia, and Europe might have remained at peace. But\r\nas England and France were both involved in the contest, their old\r\nspirit of rivalry returned; and, from auxiliaries, they became\r\nprincipals in the war, and soon renewed it. The theatre of strife was\r\nchanged from Germany to Holland, and the arms of France were\r\ntriumphant. The Duke of Cumberland was routed by Marshal Saxe at the\r\ngreat battle of Fontenoy; and this battle restored peace, for a while,\r\nto Germany. The Grand Duke of Tuscany, husband of Maria Theresa, was\r\nelected Emperor of Germany, and assumed the title of Francis\xc2\xa0I.\r\n\r\nBut it was easier to restore tranquillity to Germany, than peace\r\nbetween England and France; both powers panting for military glory,\r\nand burning with mutual jealousy. The peace of Aix la Chapelle, in\r\n1748, was a truce rather than a treaty; and France and England soon\r\nfound occasion to plunge into new hostilities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Louisburg.]\r\n\r\nDuring the war of the Austrian Succession, hostilities had not been\r\nconfined to the continent of Europe. As colonial jealousy was one of\r\nthe animating principles of two of the leading powers in the contest,\r\nthe warfare extended to the colonies themselves. A body of French,\r\nfrom Cape Breton, surprised the little English garrison of Canseau,\r\ndestroyed the fort and fishery, and removed eighty men, as prisoners\r\nof war, to Louisburg--the strongest fortress, next to Quebec, in\r\nFrench America. These men were afterwards sent to Boston, on parole,\r\nand, while there, communicated to Governor Shirley the state of the\r\nfortress in which they had been confined. Shirley resolved to capture\r\nit, and the legislature of Massachusetts voted supplies for the\r\nexpedition. All the New England colonies sent volunteers; and the\r\nunited forces, of about four thousand men were put under the command\r\nof William Pepperell, a merchant at Kittery Point, near Portsmouth.\r\nThe principal part of the forces was composed of fishermen; but they\r\nwere Yankees. Amid the fogs of April, this little army, rich in\r\nexpedients, set sail to take a fortress which five hundred men could\r\ndefend against five thousand. But they were successful, aided by an\r\nEnglish fleet; and, after a siege of three months, Louisburg\r\nsurrendered, (1745)--justly deemed the greatest achievement of the\r\nwhole war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Great Colonial Contest.]\r\n\r\nBut the French did not relinquish their hopes of gaining an ascendency\r\non the American continent, and prosecuted their labors of erecting on\r\nthe Ohio their chain of fortifications, to connect Canada with\r\nLouisiana. The erection of these forts was no small cause of the\r\nbreaking out of fresh hostilities. When the contest was renewed\r\nbetween Maria Theresa and Frederic the Great, and the famous Seven\r\nYears\' War began, the English resolved to conquer all the French\r\npossessions in America.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting, however, for directions from England, Governor\r\nDinwiddie, of Virginia, raised a regiment of troops, of which George\r\nWashington was made lieutenant-colonel, and with which he marched\r\nacross the wilderness to attack Fort Du Quesne, now Pittsburg, at the\r\njunction of the Alleghany and Monongahela Rivers.\r\n\r\nThat unsuccessful expedition was the commencement of the great\r\ncolonial contest in which Canada was conquered. Early in 1755, General\r\nBraddock was sent to America to commence offensive operations. The\r\ncolonies co\xc3\xb6perated, and three expeditions were planned; one to attack\r\nFort Du Quesne, a second to attack Fort Niagara, and a third to attack\r\nCrown Point. The first was to be composed of British troops, under\r\nBraddock, the second of American, under Governor Shirley, and the\r\nthird of militia of the northern colonies.\r\n\r\nThe expedition against Fort Du Quesne was a memorable failure.\r\nBraddock was a brave man, but unfitted for his work, Hyde Park having\r\nhitherto been the only field of his military operations. Moreover,\r\nwith that presumption and audacity which then characterized his\r\ncountrymen, he affected sovereign contempt for his American\r\nassociates, and would listen to no advice. Unacquainted with Indian\r\nwarfare, and ignorant of the country, he yet pressed towards the\r\ninterior, until, within ten miles of Fort Du Quesne, he was surprised\r\nby a body of French and Indians, and taken in an ambuscade. Instant\r\nretreat might still have saved him; but he was too proud not to fight\r\naccording to rule; and he fell mortally wounded. Washington was the\r\nonly mounted officer that escaped being killed or wounded. By his\r\nprudent and skilful management, he saved half of his men, who formed\r\nafter the battle, and effected a retreat.\r\n\r\nThe other two expeditions also failed, chiefly through want of union\r\nbetween the provincial governor and the provincial assemblies, and\r\nalso from the moral effects of the defeat of Braddock. Moreover, the\r\ncolonies perfectly understood that they were fighting, not for\r\nliberty, but for the glory and ambition of the mother country, and\r\ntherefore did not exhibit the ardor they evinced in the revolutionary\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nBut the failure of these expeditions contributed to make the ministry\r\nof the Duke of Newcastle unpopular. Other mistakes were also made in\r\nthe old world. The conduct of Admiral Byng in the Mediterranean\r\nexcited popular clamor. The repeated disappointments and miscarriages,\r\nthe delay of armaments, the neglect of opportunities, the absurd\r\ndisposition of fleets, were numbered among the misfortunes which\r\nresulted from a weak and incapable ministry. Stronger men were\r\ndemanded by the indignant voice of the nation, and the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, first lord of the treasury, since the death of his brother,\r\nwas obliged to call Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge--the two most popular\r\ncommoners of England--into the cabinet. But the new administration did\r\nnot work harmoniously. It was an emblem of that image which\r\nNebuchadnezzar beheld in a vision, with a head of gold, and legs of\r\niron, and feet of clay. Pitt and Legge were obliged by their colleague\r\nto resign. But their removal incensed the whole nation, and so great\r\nwas the clamor, that the king was compelled to reinstate the popular\r\nidols--the only men capable of managing affairs at that crisis. Pitt\r\nbecame secretary of state, and Legge chancellor of the exchequer. The\r\nDuke of Newcastle, after being at the head of administration ten\r\nyears, was, reluctantly, compelled to resign. The Duke of Devonshire\r\nbecame nominally the premier, but Pitt was the ruling spirit in the\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of the Duke of Newcastle.]\r\n\r\nThe character of the Duke of Newcastle is thus sketched by Horace\r\nWalpole; "He had no pride, but infinite self-love. Jealousy was the\r\ngreat source of all his faults. There was no expense to which he was\r\naddicted but generosity. His houses, gardens, table, and equipage,\r\nswallowed immense sums, and the sums he owed were only exceeded by\r\nthose he wasted. He loved business immoderately, but was always doing\r\nit; he never did it. His speeches were copious in words, but empty and\r\nunmeaning, his professions extravagant, and his curiosity insatiable.\r\nHe was a secretary of state without intelligence, a duke without\r\nmoney, a man of infinite intrigue without secrecy, and a minister\r\nhated by all parties, without being turned out by either." "All able\r\nmen," adds Macaulay, "ridiculed him as a dunce, a driveller, a child\r\nwho never knew his own mind an hour together; and yet he overreached\r\nthem all."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unpopularity of the Pelhams.]\r\n\r\nThe Pelham administration cannot, on the whole, be called fortunate,\r\nnor, on the other hand, a disgraceful one. The Pelhams "showed\r\nthemselves," says Smyth, "friendly to the principles of mild\r\ngovernment." With all their faults, they were tolerant, peaceful,\r\nprudent; they had the merit of respecting public opinion; and though\r\nthey were not fitted to advance the prosperity of their country by any\r\nexertions of political genius, they were not blind to such\r\nopportunities as fairly presented themselves. But they were not fitted\r\nfor the stormy times in which they lived, and quietly yielded to the\r\ngenius of a man whom they did not like, and whom the king absolutely\r\nhated. George\xc2\xa0II., against his will, was obliged to intrust the helm\r\nof state to the only man in the nation capable of holding it.\r\n\r\nThe administration of William Pitt is emphatically the history of the\r\ncivilized world, during a period of almost universal war. It was for\r\nhis talents as a war minister that he was placed at the head of the\r\ngovernment, and his policy, like that of his greater son, in a still\r\nmore stormy epoch, was essentially warlike. In the eyes of his\r\ncontemporaries, his administration was brilliant and successful, and\r\nhe undoubtedly raised England to a high pitch of military glory; but\r\nglory, alas! most dearly purchased, since it led to the imposition of\r\ntaxes beyond a parallel, and the vast increase of the national debt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of William Pitt.]\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1708, of good family, his grandfather having been\r\ngovernor of Madras, and the purchaser of the celebrated diamond which\r\nbears his name, and which was sold to the regent of France for one\r\nhundred and thirty-five thousand pounds. William Pitt was sent to\r\nOxford at the age of seventeen, and at twenty-seven, became a member\r\nof parliament. From the first, he was heard with attention, and, when\r\nyears and experience had given him wisdom and power, his eloquence was\r\noverwhelming. No one ever equalled him in brilliant invective and\r\nscorching sarcasm. He had not the skill of Fox in debate, nor was he a\r\ngreat reasoner, like Murray; he did not talk philosophy, like Burke,\r\nnor was he master of details, like his son; but he had an air of\r\nsincerity, a vehemence of feeling, an intense enthusiasm, and a moral\r\nelevation of sentiment, which bore every thing away before him.\r\n\r\nWhen Walpole was driven from power, Pitt exerted his eloquence in\r\nbehalf of the Pelham government. Being personally obnoxious to the\r\nking, he obtained no office. But he was not a man to be amused by\r\npromises long, and, as he would not render his indispensable services\r\nwithout a reward, he was made paymaster of the forces--a lucrative\r\noffice, but one which did not give him a seat in the cabinet. This\r\noffice he retained for eight years, which were years of peace. But\r\nwhen the horizon was overclouded by the death of Henry Pelham, in\r\n1754, and difficulties arose between France and England respecting\r\nNorth America and the East Indies; when disasters in war tarnished the\r\nglory of the British arms, and the Duke of Newcastle showed his\r\nincapacity to meet the national crisis, Pitt commenced a furious\r\nopposition. Of course he was dismissed from office. But the Duke of\r\nNewcastle could not do without him, and the king was obliged to call\r\nhim into the cabinet as secretary of state, in 1756. But the\r\nadministration did not work. The king opposed the views of Pitt, and\r\nhe was compelled to resign. Then followed disasters and mistakes. The\r\nresignation of the Duke of Newcastle became an imperative necessity.\r\nDespondency and gloom hung over the nation, and he was left without\r\nefficient aid in the House of Commons. Nothing was left to the king\r\nbut to call in the aid of the man he hated; and Pitt, as well as\r\nLegge, were again reinstated, the Duke of Devonshire remaining\r\nnominally at the head of the administration.\r\n\r\nBut this administration only lasted five months, during which Admiral\r\nByng was executed, and the Seven Years\' War, of which Frederic of\r\nPrussia was the hero, fairly commenced. In 1757, Pitt and his\r\ncolleague were again dismissed. But never was popular resentment more\r\nfierce and terrible. Again was the king obliged to bend to the "great\r\ncommoner." An arrangement was made, and a coalition formed. Pitt\r\nbecame secretary of state, and virtual premier, but the Duke of\r\nNewcastle came in as first lord of the treasury. But Pitt selected the\r\ncabinet. His brother-in-law, Lord Temple, was made keeper of the privy\r\nseal, and Lord Grenville was made treasurer of the navy; Fox became\r\npaymaster of the forces; the Duke of Bedford received the lord\r\nlieutenancy of Ireland; Hardwicke, the greatest lawyer of his age\r\nbecame lord chancellor; Legge, the ablest financier, was made\r\nchancellor of the exchequer. Murray, a little while before, had been\r\nelevated to the bench, as Lord Mansfield. There was scarcely an\r\neminent man in the House of Commons who was not made a member of the\r\nadministration. All the talent of the nation was laid at the feet of\r\nPitt, and he had the supreme direction of the army and of foreign\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThen truly commenced the brilliant career of Pitt. He immediately\r\nprosecuted hostilities with great boldness, and on a gigantic scale.\r\nImmense armies were raised and sent to all parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brilliant Military Successes.]\r\n\r\nBut nothing raised the reputation of Pitt so highly as military\r\noperations in America. He planned, immediately on his assumption of\r\nsupreme power as virtual dictator of England, three great\r\nexpeditions--one against Louisburg, a second against Ticonderoga, and\r\na third against Fort Du Quesne. Two of these were attended with\r\ntriumphant success, (1758.)\r\n\r\nLouisburg, which had been surrendered to France by the treaty of Aix\r\nla Chapelle, was reduced by General Amherst, though only with a force\r\nof fourteen thousand men.\r\n\r\nGeneral Forbes marched, with eight thousand men, against Fort Du\r\nQuesne; but it was abandoned by the enemy before he reached it.\r\n\r\nTiconderoga was not, however, taken, although the expedition was\r\nconducted by General Abercrombie, with a force of sixteen thousand\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThus nearly the largest military force ever known at one time in\r\nAmerica was employed nearly a century ago, by William Pitt, composed\r\nof fifty thousand men, of whom twenty-two thousand were regular\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military Successes in America.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1759 was attended with greater results than even that\r\nof the preceding year. General Amherst succeeded Abercrombie, and the\r\nplan for the reduction of Canada was intrusted to him for execution.\r\nThree great expeditions were projected: one was to be commanded by\r\nGeneral Wolfe, who had distinguished himself at the siege of\r\nLouisburg, and who had orders from the war secretary to ascend the St.\r\nLawrence, escorted by the fleet, and lay siege to Quebec. The second\r\narmy, of twelve thousand men, under General Amherst, was ordered to\r\nreduce Ticonderoga and Crown Point, cross Lake Champlain, and proceed\r\nalong the River Richelieu to the banks of the St. Lawrence, join\r\nGeneral Wolfe, and assist in the reduction of Quebec. The third army\r\nwas sent to Fort Niagara, the most important post in French America,\r\nsince it commanded the lakes, and overawed the whole country of the\r\nSix Nations. After the reduction of this fort, the army was ordered\r\ndown the St. Lawrence to besiege Montreal.\r\n\r\nThat this project was magnificent, and showed the comprehensive\r\nmilitary genius of Pitt, cannot be doubted. But that it was easy of\r\nexecution may well be questioned, when it is remembered that the\r\nnavigation of the St. Lawrence was difficult and dangerous; that the\r\nfortifications and strength of Quebec were unrivalled in the new\r\nworld; that the French troops between Montreal and Quebec numbered\r\nnine thousand men, besides Indians, commanded, too, by so great a\r\ngeneral as Montcalm. Still all of these expeditions were successful.\r\nQuebec and Niagara were taken, and Crown Point and Ticonderoga were\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of the enterprise was the capture of Quebec,\r\nwhich was one of the most brilliant military exploits ever performed,\r\nand which raised the English general to the very summit of military\r\nfame. He was disappointed in the expected co\xc3\xb6peration of General\r\nAmherst, and he had to take one of the strongest fortresses in the\r\nworld, defended by troops superior in number to his own. He succeeded\r\nin climbing the almost perpendicular rock on which the fortress was\r\nbuilt, and in overcoming a superior force. Wolfe died in the attack,\r\nbut lived long enough to hear of the flight of the enemy. Nothing\r\ncould exceed the tumultuous joy in England with which the news of the\r\nfall of Quebec was received; nothing could surpass the interest with\r\nwhich the distant expedition was viewed; and the depression of the\r\nFrench was equal to the enthusiasm of the English. Wolfe gained an\r\nimmortal name, and a monument was erected to him in Westminster Abbey.\r\nBut Pitt reaped the solid and substantial advantages which resulted\r\nfrom the conquest of Canada, which soon followed the reduction of\r\nQuebec. He became the nation\'s idol, and was left to prosecute the\r\nvarious wars in which England was engaged, in his own way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victories of Clive in India.]\r\n\r\nWhile the English armies, under the direction of Pitt, were wresting\r\nfrom the French nearly all their possessions in America, Clive was\r\nadding a new empire to the vast dominions of Great Britain. India was\r\nconquered, and the British power firmly planted in the East. Moreover,\r\nthe English allies on the continent--the Prussians--obtained great\r\nvictories, which will be alluded to in the chapter on Frederic the\r\nGreat. On all sides the English were triumphant, and were intoxicated\r\nwith joy. The stocks rose, and the bells rang almost an incessant peal\r\nfor victories.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these public rejoicings, King George\xc2\xa0II. died. He was\r\na sovereign who never secured the affections of the nation, whose\r\ninterests he sacrificed to those of his German electorate, "He had\r\nneither the qualities which make libertinism attractive nor the\r\nqualities which make dulness respectable. He had been a bad son, and\r\nhe made a worse father. Not one magnanimous action is recorded of him,\r\nbut many meannesses. But his judgment was sound, his habits\r\neconomical, and his spirit bold. These qualities prevented him from\r\nbeing despised, if they did not make him honored."\r\n\r\nHis grandson, George\xc2\xa0III., entered upon his long reign, October, 1760,\r\nin the twenty-third year of his age, and was universally admitted to\r\nbe the most powerful monarch in Christendom--or, rather, the monarch\r\nof the most powerful kingdom. He, or, rather, his ministers, resolved\r\nto prosecute the war with vigor, and parliament voted liberal\r\nsupplies. The object of Pitt was the humiliation of both France and\r\nAustria, and also the protection of Prussia, struggling against almost\r\noverwhelming forces. He secured his object by administering to the\r\nnation those draughts of flattery and military glory which intoxicated\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resignation of Pitt.]\r\n\r\nHowever sincere the motives and brilliant the genius of the minister,\r\nit was impossible that a practical nation should not awake from the\r\ndelusion, which he so powerfully contributed to produce. People at\r\nlast inquired "why England was to become a party in a dispute between\r\ntwo German powers, and why were the best English regiments fighting on\r\nthe Maine?" What was it to the busy shopkeeper of London that the\r\nTower guns were discharged, and the streets illuminated, if he were to\r\nbe additionally taxed? Statesmen began to calculate the enormous sums\r\nwhich had been wasted in an expensive war, where nothing had been\r\ngained but glory. Besides, jealousies and enmities sprung up against\r\nPitt. Some were offended by his haughtiness, and others were estranged\r\nby his withering invective. And his enemies were numerous and\r\npowerful. Even the cabinet ministers, who were his friends, turned\r\nagainst him. He wished to declare war against Spain, while the nation\r\nwas bleeding at every pore. But the cabinet could not be persuaded of\r\nthe necessity of the war, and Pitt, of course, resigned. But it was\r\ninevitable, and took place under his successor. Pitt left the helm of\r\nstate with honor. He received a pension of three thousand pounds a\r\nyear, and his wife was made a baroness.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Bute succeeded him as premier, and was the first Tory\r\nminister since the accession of the house of Hanover. His watchword\r\nwas _prerogative_. The sovereign should no longer be a gilded puppet,\r\nbut a real king--an impossible thing in England. But his schemes\r\npleased the king, and Oxford University, and Dr. Johnson; while his\r\nadministration was assailed with a host of libels from Wilkes,\r\nChurchill, and other kindred firebrands.\r\n\r\nHis main act was the peace he secured to Europe. The Whigs railed at\r\nit then, and rail at it now; and Macaulay falls in with the\r\nlamentation of his party, and regrets that no better terms should have\r\nbeen made. But what can satisfy the ambition of England? The peace of\r\nParis, in 1763, stipulated that Canada, with the Island of St. John,\r\nand Cape Breton, and all that part of Louisiana which lies east of the\r\nMississippi, except New Orleans, should be ceded to Great Britain, and\r\nthat the fortifications of Dunkirk should be destroyed; that Spain\r\nshould relinquish her claim to fish on the Banks of Newfoundland,\r\nshould permit the English to cut mahogany on the shores of Honduras\r\nBay, and cede Florida and Minorca to Great Britain. In return for\r\nthese things, the French were permitted to fish on the Banks of\r\nNewfoundland, and the Islands of Martinique, Guadaloupe, Belleisle,\r\nand St. Lucia were restored to them, and Cuba was restored to Spain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peace of Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe peace of Paris, in 1763, constitutes an epoch; and we hence turn\r\nto survey the condition of France since the death of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., and\r\nalso other continental powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Archdeacon Coxe\'s History of the Pelham\r\n     Administration.

But he was a\r\nchild, only five years of age, on the death of his great grandfather,\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XIV.; and, even after he came to his majority, he was ruled by\r\nhis ministers and his mistresses. He was not, like Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., the\r\nlife and the centre of all great movements in his country. He was an\r\nautomaton, a pageant; not because the constitution imposed checks on\r\nhis power, but because he was weak and vacillating. He, therefore,\r\nperforming no great part in history, is only to be alluded to, and\r\nattention should be mainly directed to his ministers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regency of the Duke of Orleans.]\r\n\r\nDuring the minority of the king, the reins of government were held by\r\nthe Duke of Orleans, as regent, and who, in case of the king\'s death,\r\nwould be the next king, being grand-nephew of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. The\r\nadministration of the Duke of Orleans is nearly contemporaneous with\r\nthat of Sir Robert Walpole. The most pressing subject which demanded\r\nthe attention of the regent, was that of the finances. The late king\r\nhad left a debt of one thousand millions of livres--an enormous sum in\r\nthat age. To get rid of this burden, the Duke of St. Simon proposed a\r\nbankruptcy. "This," said he, "would fall chiefly on the commercial and\r\nmoneyed classes, who were not to be feared or pitied; and would,\r\nmoreover, be not only a relief to the state, but a salutary warning to\r\nthe ignoble classes not to lend their money." This speech illustrates\r\nthe feelings and opinions of the aristocratic class in France, at that\r\ntime. But the minister of finance would not run the risk of incurring\r\nthe popular odium which such a measure would have produced, and he\r\nproposed calling together the States General. The regent duke,\r\nhowever, would not hear of that measure, and yet did not feel inclined\r\nto follow fully the advice of St. Simon. He therefore compromised the\r\nmatter, and resolved to rob the national creditor. He established a\r\ncommission to verify the bills of the public creditors, and, if their\r\naccounts did not prove satisfactory, to cancel them entirely. Three\r\nhundred and fifty millions of livres--equal, probably, to three\r\nhundred millions of dollars in this age--were thus swept away. But it\r\nwas resolved not only to refuse to pay just debts, but to make people\r\nrepay the gains which they had made. Those who had loaned money to the\r\nstate, or had farmed the revenues, were flung into prison, and\r\nthreatened with confiscation of their goods, and even death,--treated\r\nas Jews were treated in the Dark Ages,--unless they redeemed\r\nthemselves by purchasing a pardon. Never before did men suffer such a\r\npenalty for having befriended an embarrassed state. To this injustice\r\nand cruelty the magistracy winked. But, in addition to this, the coin\r\nwas debased to such an extent, that seventy-two millions of livres\r\nwere thus added to the treasury. Yet even these gains were not enough\r\nto satisfy a profligate government. There still continued a constant\r\npressure. The national debt had increased even to fifteen hundred\r\nmillions of livres, or almost seventy millions sterling--equivalent to\r\nwhat would now be equal to at least one thousand millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Law.]\r\n\r\nTo get rid of this debt, the regent listened to the schemes of the\r\ncelebrated John Law, a Scotch adventurer and financier, who had\r\nestablished a bank, had grown rich, and was reputed to be a wonderful\r\npolitical economist.\r\n\r\nLaw proposed, in substance, to increase the paper currency of the\r\ncountry, and thus supersede the necessity for the use of the precious\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nThe regent, moreover, having great faith in Law\'s abilities, and in\r\nhis wealth, converted his private bank into a royal one--made it, in\r\nshort, the Bank of France. This bank was then allied with the two\r\ngreat commercial companies of the time--the East India and the\r\nMississippi. Great privileges were bestowed on each. The latter had\r\nthe exclusive monopoly of the trade with Louisiana, and all the\r\ncountries on the Mississippi River, and also of the fur trade in\r\nCanada. Louisiana was then supposed to be rich in gold mines, and\r\ngreat delusions arose from the popular notion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mississippi Company.]\r\n\r\nThe capital of this gigantic corporation was fixed at one hundred\r\nmillions and Law, who was made director-general, aimed to make the\r\nnotes of the company preferable to specie, which, however could\r\nlawfully be demanded for the notes. So it was settled that the shares\r\nof the company could only be purchased by the paper of the bank. As\r\nextravagant hopes of gain were cherished respecting the company, its\r\nshares were in great demand. And, as only Law\'s bank bills could\r\npurchase the shares, the gold and silver of the realm flowed into\r\nLaw\'s bank. Law and the regent had, therefore, the fabrication of both\r\nshares and bank bills to an indefinite amount.\r\n\r\nThe national creditor was also paid in the notes of the bank, and, as\r\nunbounded confidence existed, both in the genius of Law and in the\r\nprofits of the Mississippi Company,--as the shares were constantly in\r\ndemand, and were rising in value,--the creditor was satisfied. In a\r\nshort time, one half of the national debt was transferred. Government\r\nowed the bank, and not the individuals and corporations from whom\r\nloans had been originally obtained. These individuals, instead of\r\ngovernment scrip, had shares in the Mississippi Company.\r\n\r\nAnd all would have been well, had the company\'s shares been valuable,\r\nor had they retained their credit, or even had but a small part of the\r\nnational debt been transferred. But the people did not know the real\r\nissues of the bank, and so long as new shares could be created and\r\nsold to pay the interest, the company\'s credit was good. For a while\r\nthe delusion lasted. Law was regarded as a great national benefactor.\r\nHis house was thronged with dukes and princes. He became\r\ncontroller-general of the finances--virtually prime minister. His fame\r\nextended far and wide. Honors were showered upon him from every\r\nquarter. He was elected a member of the French Academy. His schemes\r\nseemed to rain upon Paris a golden shower. He had freed the state from\r\nembarrassments, and he had, apparently, made every body rich, and no\r\none poor. He was a deity, as beneficent as he was powerful. He became\r\nhimself the richest man in Europe. Every body was intoxicated. The\r\ngolden age had come. Paris was crowded with strangers from all parts\r\nof the world. Five hundred thousand strangers expended their fortunes,\r\nin hope of making greater ones. Twelve hundred new coaches were set up\r\nin the city. Lodgings could scarcely be had for money. The highest\r\nprice was paid for provisions. Widow ladies, clergymen, and noblemen\r\ndeserted London to speculate in stocks at Paris. Nothing was seen but\r\nnew equipages, new houses, new apparel, new furniture. Nothing was\r\nfelt but universal exhilaration. Every man seemed to have made his\r\nfortune. The stocks rose every day. The higher they rose, the more new\r\nstock was created. At last, the shares of the company rose from one\r\nhundred to twelve hundred per cent., and three hundred millions were\r\ncreated, which were nominally worth, in 1719, three thousand six\r\nhundred millions of livres--one hundred and eighty times the amount of\r\nall the gold and silver in Europe at that time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popular Delusion.]\r\n\r\nIn this public delusion, the directors were wise enough to convert\r\n_their_ shares into silver and gold. A great part of the current coin\r\nin the kingdom was locked up in the houses or banks of a few\r\nstockjobbers and speculators.\r\n\r\nBut the scarcity of gold and silver was felt, people\'s eyes were\r\nopened, and the bubble burst, but not until half of the national debt\r\nhad been paid off by this swindling transaction.\r\n\r\nThe nation was furious. A panic spread among all classes; the bank had\r\nno money with which to redeem its notes; the shares fell almost to\r\nnothing; and universal bankruptcy took place. Those who, a few days\r\nbefore, fancied themselves rich, now found themselves poor. Property\r\nof all kinds fell to less than its original value. Houses, horses,\r\ncarriages, upholstery, every thing, declined in price. All were\r\nsellers, and few were purchasers.\r\n\r\nBut popular execration and vengeance pursued the financier who had\r\ndeceived the nation. He was forced to fly from Paris. His whole\r\nproperty was confiscated, and he was reduced to indigence and\r\ncontempt. When his scheme was first suggested to the regent, he was\r\nworth three millions of livres. He had better remained a private\r\nbanker.\r\n\r\nThe bursting of the Mississippi bubble, of course, inflamed the nation\r\nagainst the government, and the Duke of Orleans was execrated, for his\r\nagency in the business had all the appearance of a fraud. But he was\r\nprobably deluded with others, and hoped to free the country from its\r\nburdens. The great blunder was in the over-issue of notes when there\r\nwas no money to redeem them.\r\n\r\nNor could any management have prevented the catastrophe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fatal Effects of the Delusion.]\r\n\r\nIt was not possible that the shares of the company should advance so\r\ngreatly, and the public not perceive that they had advanced beyond\r\ntheir value; it was not possible, that, while paper money so vastly\r\nincreased in quantity, the numerical prices of all other things should\r\nnot increase also, and that foreigners who sold their manufactures to\r\nthe French should not turn their paper into gold, and carry it out of\r\nthe kingdom; it was not possible that the disappearance of the coin\r\nshould not create alarm, notwithstanding the edicts of the regent, and\r\nthe reasonings of Law; it was not possible that annuitants should not\r\ndiscover that their old incomes were now insufficient and less\r\nvaluable, as the medium in which they were paid was less valuable; it\r\nwas not possible that the small part of society which may be called\r\nthe sober and reasoning part, should not be so struck with the sudden\r\nfortunes and extravagant enthusiasm which prevailed, as not to doubt\r\nof the solidity of a system, unphilosophical in itself, and which,\r\nafter all, had to depend on the profits of a commercial company, the\r\ngood faith of the regent, and the skill of Law; it was impossible, on\r\nthese and other accounts, but that gold and silver should be at last\r\npreferred to paper notes, of whatever description or promise. These\r\nwere inevitable consequences. Hence the failure of the scheme of Law,\r\nand the ruin of all who embarked in it, owing to a change in public\r\nopinion as to the probable success of the scheme, and, secondly, the\r\nover-issue of money.\r\n\r\nBy this great folly, four hundred thousand families were ruined, or\r\ngreatly reduced; but the government got rid of about eight hundred\r\nmillions of debts. The sufferings of the people, with such a\r\ngovernment, did not, however, create great solicitude; the same old\r\ncourse of folly and extravagance was pursued by the court.\r\n\r\nNor was there a change for the better when Louis\xc2\xa0XV. attained his\r\nmajority. His vices and follies exceeded all that had ever been\r\ndisplayed before. The support of his mistresses alone was enough to\r\nembarrass the nation. Their waste and extravagance almost exceeded\r\nbelief. Who has not heard of the disgraceful and disgusting iniquities\r\nof Pompadour and Du Barry?\r\n\r\nThe regency of the Duke of Orleans occupied the first eight years of\r\nthe reign of Louis\xc2\xa0XV. The prime minister of the regent was Dubois, at\r\nfirst his tutor, and afterwards Archbishop of Cambray. He was rewarded\r\nwith a cardinal\'s hat for the service he rendered to the Jesuits in\r\ntheir quarrel with the Jansenists, but was a man of unprincipled\r\ncharacter; a fit minister to a prince who pretended to be too\r\nintellectual to worship God, and who copied Henry\xc2\xa0IV. only in his\r\nlicentiousness.\r\n\r\nThe first minister of Louis\xc2\xa0XV., after he assumed himself the reins of\r\ngovernment, was the Duke of Bourbon, lineal heir of the house of\r\nCond\xc3\xa9, and first prince of the blood. But he was a man of no\r\ncharacter, and his short administration was signalized by no important\r\nevent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Administration of Cardinal Fleury.]\r\n\r\nCardinal Fleury succeeded the Duke of Bourbon as prime minister. He\r\nhad been preceptor of the king, and was superior to all the intrigues\r\nof the court; a man of great timidity, but also a man of great\r\nprobity, gentleness, and benignity. Fortunately, he was intrusted with\r\npower at a period of great domestic tranquillity, and his\r\nadministration was, like that of Walpole, pacific. He projected,\r\nhowever, no schemes of useful reform, and made no improvements in laws\r\nor finance. But he ruled despotically, and with good intentions, from\r\n1726 to 1743.\r\n\r\nThe most considerable subject of interest connected with his peaceful\r\nadministration, was the quarrel between the Jesuits and the\r\nJansenists. Fleury took the side of the former, although he was never\r\nan active partisan; and he was induced to support the Jesuits for the\r\nsake of securing the cardinal\'s hat--the highest honor, next to that\r\nof the tiara, which could be conferred on an ecclesiastic. The Jesuits\r\nupheld the crumbling power of the popes, and the popes rewarded the\r\nadvocates of that body of men, who were their ablest supporters.\r\n\r\nThe Jansenist controversy is too important to be passed over with a\r\nmere allusion. It was the great event in the history of Catholic\r\nEurope during the seventeenth century. It involved principles of great\r\ntheological, and even political interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cornelius Jansen.]\r\n\r\nThe Jansenist controversy grew out of the long-disputed questions\r\npertaining to grace and free will--questions which were agitated with\r\ngreat spirit and acrimony in the seventeenth century as they had\r\npreviously been centuries before by Augustine and Pelagius. The\r\nJesuits had never agreed with the great oracle of the Western church\r\nin his views on certain points, and it was their aim to show the\r\nabsolute freedom of the human will--that it had a self-determining\r\npower, a perfect liberty to act or not to act. Molina, a Spanish\r\nJesuit, had been a great defender of this ancient Pelagianism, and his\r\nviews were opposed by the Dominicans, and the controversy was carried\r\ninto all the universities of Europe. The Council of Trent was too wise\r\nto meddle with this difficult question; but angry theologians would\r\nnot let it rest, and it was discussed with peculiar fervor in the\r\nCatholic University of Louvaine. Among the doctors who there\r\ndistinguished themselves in reviving the great contest of the fifth\r\nand sixth centuries, were Cornelius Jansen of Holland, and Jean de\r\nVerger of Gascony. Both these doctors hated the Jesuits, and lamented\r\nthe dangerous doctrines which they defended, and advocated the views\r\nof Augustine and the Calvinists. Jansen became professor of divinity\r\nin the university, and then Bishop of Ypres. After an uninterrupted\r\nstudy of twenty years, he produced his celebrated book called\r\n_Augustinus_, in which he set forth the servitude of the will, and the\r\nnecessity of divine grace to break the bondage, which, however, he\r\nmaintained, like Calvin, is imparted only to a few, and in pursuance\r\nof a decree existing in the divine mind before the creation of our\r\nspecies. But Jansen died before the book was finished, and two years\r\nelapsed before it was published, but, when published, it was the\r\nsignal for a contest which distracted Europe for seventy years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: St. Cyran--Arnauld--Le Maitre.]\r\n\r\nWhile Jansen was preparing this work, his early companion and friend,\r\nDe Verger, a man of family and rank, had become abbot of the monastery\r\nof St. Cyran in Paris, and had formed, in the centre of that gay city,\r\na learned and ascetic hermitage. This was during the reign of\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XIII. His reputation, as a scholar and a saint, attracted the\r\nattention of Richelieu, and his services were solicited by that able\r\nminister. But neither rewards, nor flatteries, nor applause had power\r\nover the mind of St. Cyran, as he was now called. The cardinal hated\r\nand feared a man whom he could not bribe or win, and soon found means\r\nto quarrel with him, and sent him to the gloomy fortress of Vincennes.\r\nBut there, in his prison, he devoted himself, with renewed ardor, to\r\nhis studies and duties, subduing his appetites and passions by an\r\nasceticism which even his church did not require, and devoting all his\r\nthoughts and words to the service of God. Like Calvin and Augustine,\r\nhe had so profound a conception of the necessity of an inward change,\r\nthat he made grace precede repentance. A man so serene in trial, so\r\nhumble in spirit, so natural and childlike in ordinary life, and yet\r\nso distinguished for talents and erudition, could not help exciting\r\nadmiration, and making illustrious proselytes. Among them was Arnauld\r\nD\'Antilly, the intimate friend of Richelieu and Anne of Austria; Le\r\nMaitre, the most eloquent lawyer and advocate in France; and Angelique\r\nArnauld, the abbess of Port Royal. This last was one of the most\r\ndistinguished ladies of her age, noble by birth, and still more noble\r\nby her beautiful qualities of mind and heart. She had been made abbess\r\nof her Cistercian convent at the age of eleven years, and at that time\r\nwas gay, social, and light-hearted. The preaching of a Capuchin friar\r\nhad turned her thoughts to the future world, and she closed the gates\r\nof her beautiful abbey, in the vale of Chevreuse, against all\r\nstrangers, and devoted herself to the ascetic duties which her church\r\nand age accounted most meritorious. She soon after made the\r\nacquaintance of St. Cyran, and he imbued her mind with the principles\r\nof the Augustinian theology. When imprisoned at Vincennes, he was\r\nstill the spiritual father of Port Royal. Amid this famous retreat\r\nwere collected the greatest scholars and the greatest saints of the\r\nseventeenth century--Antoine Le Maitre, De Lericourt, Le Maitre de\r\nSaci, Antoine Arnauld, and Pascal himself. Le Maitre de Saci gave to\r\nthe world the best translation of the Bible in French; Arnauld wrote\r\none hundred volumes of controversy, and, among them, a noted satire on\r\nthe Jesuits, which did them infinite harm; while Pascal, besides his\r\nwonderful mathematical attainments, and his various meditative works,\r\nis immortalized for his Provincial Letters, written in the purest\r\nFrench, and with matchless power and beauty. This work, directed\r\nagainst the Jesuits, is an inimitable model of elegant irony, and the\r\nmost effective sarcasm probably ever elaborated by man. In the vale of\r\nPort Royal also dwelt Tillemont, the great ecclesiastical historian;\r\nFontaine and Racine, who were controlled by the spirit of Arnauld, as\r\nwell as the Prince of Conti, and the Duke of Liancourt. There resided,\r\nunder the name of _Le Merrier_, and in the humble occupation of a\r\ngardener, one of the proudest nobles of the French court; and there,\r\ntoo, dwelt the celebrated Duchess of Longueville, sister of the Prince\r\nof Cond\xc3\xa9, the life of the Fronde, the idol of the Parisian mob, and the\r\nonce gay patroness of the proudest festivities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Labors of the Port Royalists.]\r\n\r\nBut it is the labors of these saints, scholars, and nobles to repress\r\nthe dangerous influence of the Jesuits for which they were most\r\ndistinguished. The Jansenists of Port Royal did not deny the authority\r\nof the pope, nor the great institutions of the papacy. They sought\r\nchiefly, in their controversy with the Jesuits, to enforce the\r\ndoctrines of Augustine respecting justification. But their efforts\r\nwere not agreeable to the popes, nor to the doctors of the Sorbonne,\r\nwho had no sympathy with their religious life, and detested their bold\r\nspirit of inquiry. The doctors of the Sorbonne, accordingly, extracted\r\nfrom the book of Jansen five propositions which they deemed heretical,\r\nand urged the pope to condemn them. The Port Royalists admitted that\r\nthese five propositions were indefensible if they were declared\r\nheretical by the sovereign pontiff, but denied that they were actually\r\nto be found in the book of Jansen. They did not quarrel with the pope\r\non grounds of faith. They recognized his infallibility in matters of\r\nreligion, but not in matters of fact. The pope, not wishing to push\r\nthings to extremity, which never was the policy of Rome, pretended to\r\nbe satisfied. But the Jesuits would not let him rest, and insisted on\r\nthe condemnation of the Jansenist opinions. The case was brought\r\nbefore a great council of French bishops and doctors, and Arnauld, the\r\ngreat champion of the Jansenists, was voted guilty of heresy for\r\ndenying that the five propositions which the pope condemned were\r\nactually in the book of Jansen. The pope, moreover, was induced to\r\nissue a formula of an oath, to which all who wished to enjoy any\r\noffice in the church were obliged to subscribe, and which affirmed\r\nthat the five condemned propositions were actually to be found in\r\nJansen\'s book. This act of the pope was justly regarded by the\r\nJansenists as intolerably despotic, and many of the most respectable\r\nof the French clergy sided with them in opinion. All France now became\r\ninterested in the controversy, and it soon led to great commotions.\r\nThe Jansenists then contended that the pope might err in questions of\r\nfact, and that, therefore, they were not under an obligation to\r\nsubscribe to the required oath. The Jesuits, on the other hand,\r\nmaintained the pope\'s infallibility in matters of fact, as well as in\r\ndoctrine; and, as they had the most powerful adherents, the Jansenists\r\nwere bitterly persecuted. But, as twenty-two bishops were found to\r\ntake their side, the matter was hushed up for a while. For ten years\r\nmore, the Port Royalists had peace and protection, chiefly through the\r\ngreat influence of the Duchess of Longueville; but, on her death,\r\npersecution returned. Arnauld was obliged to fly to the Netherlands,\r\nand the beautiful abbey of Port Royal was despoiled of its lands and\r\nprivileges. Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. had ever hated its inmates, being ruled by\r\nMadame de Maintenon, who, in turn, was a tool of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nBut the demolition of the abbey, the spoliation of its lands, and the\r\ndispersion of those who sought its retreat, did not stop the\r\ncontroversy. Pascal continued it, and wrote his Provincial Letters,\r\nwhich had a wonderful effect in making the Jesuits both ridiculous and\r\nhateful. That book was the severest blow this body of ambitious and\r\nartful casuists ever received.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Principles of Jansenism.]\r\n\r\nNor was the Jansenist controversy merely a discussion of grace and\r\nfree will. The principles of Jansenism, when carried out, tended to\r\nsecure independence to the national church, and to free the\r\nconsciences of men from the horrible power of their spiritual\r\nconfessors. Jansenism was a timid protest against spiritual tyranny, a\r\nmild kind of Puritanism, which found sympathy with many people in\r\nFrance. The Parliament of Paris caught the spirit of freedom, and\r\nprotected the Jansenists and those who sympathized with them. It so\r\nhappened that a certain bishop published a charge to his clergy which\r\nwas strongly imbued with the independent doctrines of the Jansenists.\r\nHe was tried and condemned by a provincial council, and banished by\r\nthe government. The Parliament of Paris, as the guardian of the law,\r\ntook up the quarrel, and Cardinal Fleury was obliged to resort to a\r\n_Bed of Justice_ in order to secure the registry of a decree. A Bed of\r\nJustice was the personal appearance of the sovereign in the supreme\r\njudicial tribunal of the nation, and his command to the members of it\r\nto obey his injunctions was the last resort of absolute power. The\r\nparliament, of course, obeyed, but protested the next day, and drew up\r\nresolutions which declared the temporal power to be independent of the\r\nspiritual. It then proceeded to Meudon, one of the royal palaces, to\r\nlay its remonstrance before the king; and Louis\xc2\xa0XV., indignant and\r\nastonished, refused to see the members. The original controversy was\r\nforgotten, and the cause of the parliament, which was the cause of\r\nliberty, became the cause of the nation. The resistance of the\r\nparliament was technically unsuccessful, yet, nevertheless, sowed the\r\nseeds of popular discontent, and contributed to that great\r\ninsurrection which finally overturned the throne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Functions of the Parliament.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bull Unigenitus.]\r\n\r\nIt may be asked how the Parliament of Paris became a judicial\r\ntribunal, rather than a legislative assembly, as in England. When the\r\nJustinian code was introduced into French jurisprudence, in the latter\r\npart of the Middle Ages, the old feudal and clerical judges--the\r\nbarons and bishops--were incapable of expounding it, and a new class\r\nof men arose--the lawyers, whose exclusive business it was to study\r\nthe laws. Being best acquainted with them, they entered upon the\r\nfunctions of judges, and the secular and clerical lords yielded to\r\ntheir opinions. The great barons, however, still continued to sit in\r\nthe judicial tribunals, although ignorant of the new jurisprudence;\r\nand their decisions were directed by the opinions of the lawyers who\r\nhad obtained a seat in their body, as is the case at present in the\r\nEnglish House of Lords when it sits as a judicial body. The necessity\r\nof providing some permanent repository for the royal edicts, induced\r\nthe kings of France to enroll them in the journals of the courts of\r\nparliament, being the highest judicial tribunal; and the members of\r\nthese courts gradually availed themselves of this custom to dispute\r\nthe legality of any edict which had not been thus registered. As the\r\ninfluence of the States General declined, the power of the parliament\r\nincreased. The encroachments of the papacy first engaged its\r\nattention, and then the management of the finances by the ministers of\r\nFrancis\xc2\xa0I. called forth remonstrances. During the war of the Fronde,\r\nthe parliament absolutely refused to register the royal decrees. But\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XIV. was sufficiently powerful to suppress the spirit of\r\nindependence, and accordingly entered the court, during the first\r\nyears of his reign, with a whip in his hand, and compelled it to\r\nregister his edicts. Nor did any murmur afterwards escape the body,\r\nuntil, at the close of his reign the members opposed the bull\r\n_Unigenitus_--that which condemned the Jansenists--as an infringement\r\nof the liberties of the Gallican Church. And no sooner had the great\r\nmonarch died, than, contrary to his will, they vested the regency in\r\nthe hands of the Duke of Orleans. Then freedom of expostulation\r\nrespecting the ruinous schemes of Law induced him to banish them, and\r\nthey only obtained their recall by degrading concessions. Their next\r\nopposition was during the administration of Fleury. The minister of\r\nfinance made an attempt to inquire into the wealth of the clergy,\r\nwhich raised the jealousy of the order; and the clergy, in order to\r\ndivert the attention of the court, revived the opposition of the\r\nparliament to the bull _Unigenitus_. It was resolved by the clergy to\r\ndemand confessional notes from dying persons, and that these notes\r\nshould be signed by priests adhering to the bull, before extreme\r\nunction should be given. The Archbishop of Paris, at the head of the\r\nFrench clergy, was opposed by the parliament, and this high judicial\r\ncourt imprisoned such of the clergy as refused to administer the\r\nsacraments. The king, under the guidance of Fleury, forbade the\r\nparliament to take cognizance of ecclesiastical proceedings, and to\r\nsuspend its prosecutions. Instead of acquiescing, the parliament\r\npresented new remonstrances, and the members refused to attend to any\r\nother functions, and resolved that they could not obey this injunction\r\nwithout violating their consciences. They cited the Bishop of Orleans\r\nbefore their tribunal, and ordered all his writings, which denied the\r\njurisdiction of the court, to be publicly burnt by the executioner. By\r\naid of the military, the parliament enforced the administration of the\r\nsacraments, and became so interested in the controversy as to neglect\r\nother official duties. The king, indignant, again banished the\r\nmembers, with the exception of four, whom he imprisoned. And, in order\r\nnot to impede the administration of justice, the king established\r\nanother tribunal for the prosecution of civil suits. But the lawyers,\r\nsympathizing with the parliament, refused to plead before the new\r\ncourt. This resolute conduct, and other evils happening at the time,\r\ninduced the king to yield, in order to conciliate the people, and the\r\nparliament was recalled. This was a popular triumph, and the\r\narchbishop was banished in his turn. Shortly after, Cardinal Fleury\r\ndied, and a new policy was adopted. The quarrel of the parliament and\r\nthe clergy was forgotten in a still greater quarrel between the king\r\nand the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Fleury, like that of Walpole, was pacific; and yet, like\r\nhim, he was forced into a war against his own convictions. And success\r\nattended the arms of France, in the colonial struggle with England,\r\nuntil Pitt took the helm of state.\r\n\r\nUntil the death of Fleury, in 1743, who administered affairs with\r\nwisdom, moderation, and incorruptible integrity, he was beloved, if he\r\nwas not venerated. But after this event, a great change took place in\r\nhis character and measures, and the reign of mistresses commenced, and\r\nto an extent unparalleled in the history of Europe. Louis\xc2\xa0XIV.\r\nbestowed the revenue of the state on unworthy favorites, yet never\r\nallowed them to govern the nation; but Louis\xc2\xa0XV. intrusted the most\r\nimportant state matters to their direction, and the profoundest state\r\nsecrets to their keeping.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Pompadour.]\r\n\r\nAmong these mistresses, Madame de Pompadour was the most noted; a\r\nwoman of talent, but abominably unprincipled. Ambition was her\r\nmaster-passion, and her _boudoir_ was the council chamber of the royal\r\nministers. Most of the great men of France paid court to her, and to\r\nneglect her was social ruin. Even Voltaire praised her beauty, and\r\nMontesquieu flattered her intellect. And her extravagance was equal to\r\nher audacity. She insisted on drawing bills on the treasury without\r\nspecifying the service. The comptroller-general was in despair, and\r\nthe state was involved in inextricable embarrassments.\r\n\r\nIt was through her influence that the Duke de Choiseul was made the\r\nsuccessor of Fleury. He was not deficient in talent, but his\r\nadministration proved unfortunate. Under his rule, Louis lost the\r\nCanadas, and France plunged into a contest with Frederic the Great.\r\nThe Seven Years\' War, which occurred during his administration, had\r\nmade the age an epoch; but as this is to be considered in the chapter\r\non Frederic\xc2\xa0III., no notice of it will be taken in this connection.\r\n\r\nThe most memorable event which arose out of the policy and conduct of\r\nChoiseul was the fall of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Jesuits.]\r\n\r\nTheir arts and influence had obtained from the pope the bull\r\n_Unigenitus_, designed to suppress their enemies, the Jansenists; and\r\nthe king, governed by Fleury, had taken their side.\r\n\r\nBut they were so unwise as to quarrel with the powerful mistress of\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XV. They despised her, and defied her hatred. Indeed, the\r\nJesuits had climbed to so great a height that they were scornful of\r\npopular clamor, and even of regal distrust. But there is no man, and\r\nno body of men, who can venture to provoke enmity with impunity; and\r\ndestruction often comes from a source the least suspected, and\r\napparently the least to be feared. Who could have supposed that the\r\nruin of this powerful body, which had reigned so proudly in\r\nChristendom for a century; which had imposed its Briareus\'s arms on\r\nthe necks of princes; which had its confessors in the courts of the\r\nmost absolute monarchs; which, with its hundred eyes, had penetrated\r\nthe secrets of all the cabinets of Europe; and which had succeeded in\r\nsuppressing in so many places every insurrection of human\r\nintelligence, in spite of the fears of kings, the jealousy of the\r\nother monastic orders, and the inveterate animosity of philosophers\r\nand statesmen,--would receive a fatal wound from the hands of a woman,\r\nwho scandalized by her vices even the depraved court of an enervated\r\nprince? But so it was. Madame de Pompadour hated the Jesuits because\r\nthey attempted to undermine her influence with the king. And she\r\nincited the prime minister, whom she had raised by her arts to power,\r\nto unite with Pombal in Portugal, in order to effect their ruin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exposure of the Jesuits.]\r\n\r\nIn no country was the power of the Jesuits more irresistible than in\r\nPortugal. There their ascendency was complete. But the prime minister\r\nof Joseph\xc2\xa0I., the Marquis of Pombal, a man of great energy, had been\r\ninsulted by a lady of the highest rank, and he swore revenge. An\r\nopportunity was soon afforded. The king happened to be fired at and\r\nwounded in his palace by some unknown enemy. The blow was aimed at the\r\nobjects of the minister\'s vengeance--the Marchioness of Tavora, her\r\nhusband, her family, and her friends the Jesuits. And royal vengeance\r\nfollowed, not merely on an illustrious family, but on those persons\r\nwhom this family befriended. The Jesuits were expelled in the most\r\nsummary manner from the kingdom. The Duke de Choiseul and Madame\r\nPompadour hailed their misfortunes with delight, and watched their\r\nopportunity for revenge. This was afforded by the failure of La\r\nValette, the head of the Jesuits at Martinique. It must be borne in\r\nmind that the Jesuits had embarked in commercial enterprises, while\r\nthey were officiating as missionaries. La Valette aimed to monopolize,\r\nfor his order, the trade with the West Indies, which commercial\r\nambition excited the jealousy of mercantile classes in France, and\r\nthey threw difficulties in his way. And it so happened that some of\r\nhis most valuable ships were taken and plundered by the English\r\ncruisers, which calamity, happening at a time of embarrassment, caused\r\nhis bills to be protested, and his bankers to stop payment. They,\r\nindignant, accused the Jesuits, as a body, of peculation and fraud,\r\nand demanded repayment from the order. Had the Jesuits been wise, they\r\nwould have satisfied the ruined bankers. But who is wise on the brink\r\nof destruction? _"Quem deus vult perdere, prius dementat."_ The\r\nJesuits refused to sacrifice La Valette to the interests of their\r\norder, which course would have been in accordance with their general\r\npolicy. The matter was carried before the Parliament of Paris, and the\r\nwhole nation was interested in its result. It was decided by this\r\nsupreme judicial tribunal, that the Jesuits were responsible for the\r\ndebts of La Valette. But the commercial injury was weak in comparison\r\nwith the moral. In the course of legal proceedings, the books and rule\r\nof the Jesuits were demanded--that mysterious rule which had never\r\nbeen exposed to the public eye, and which had been so carefully\r\nguarded. When this rule was produced, all minor questions vanished;\r\nmistresses, bankruptcies, politics, finances, wars,--all became\r\ninsignificant, compared with those questions which affected the\r\nposition and welfare of the society. Pascal became a popular idol, and\r\n"Tartuffe grew pale before Escobar." The reports of the trial lay on\r\nevery toilet table, and persons of both sexes, and of all ages and\r\nconditions, read with avidity the writings of the casuists. Nothing\r\nwas talked about but "probability," "surrender of conscience," and\r\n"mental reservations." Philosophers grew jealous of the absorbing\r\ninterest with which every thing pertaining to the _r\xc3\xa9gime_ of the\r\nJesuits was read, and of the growing popularity of the Jansenists, who\r\nhad exposed it. "What," said Voltaire, "will it profit us to be\r\ndelivered from the foxes, if we are to be given up to the wolves?" But\r\nthe philosopher had been among the first to raise the cry of alarm\r\nagainst the Jesuits, and it was no easy thing to allay the storm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Expulsion from France.]\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits, in their distress, had only one friend sufficiently\r\npowerful to protect them, and he was the king. He had been their best\r\nfriend, and he still wished to come to their rescue. He had been\r\ntaught to honor them, and he had learned to fear them. He stood in\r\nfear of assassination, and dreaded a rupture with so powerful and\r\nunscrupulous a body. And his resistance to the prosecution would have\r\nbeen insurmountable, had it not been for the capriciousness of his\r\ntemper, which more than balanced his superstitious fears. His minister\r\nand his mistress circumvented him. They represented that, as the\r\nparliament and the nation were both aroused against the Jesuits, his\r\nresistance would necessarily provoke a new Fronde. Nothing he dreaded\r\nso much as civil war. The wavering monarch, placed in the painful\r\nnecessity of choosing, as he supposed, between a war and the ruin of\r\nhis best friends, yielded to the solicitations of his artful advisers.\r\nBut he yielded with a moderation which did him honor. He would not\r\nconsent to the expulsion of the Jesuits until efforts had been made to\r\nsecure their reform. He accordingly caused letters to be written to\r\nRome, demanding an immediate attention to the subject. Choiseul\r\nhimself prepared the scheme of reformation. But the Jesuits would not\r\nhear of any retrenchment of their power or privileges. "Let us remain\r\nas we are, or let us exist no longer," was their reply. The\r\nparliament, the people, the minister, and the mistress renewed their\r\nclamors. The parliament decreed that the constitution of the society\r\nwas an encroachment on the royal authority, and the king was obliged\r\nto yield. The members of the society were forbidden to wear the habit\r\nof the society, or to enjoy any clerical office or dignity. Their\r\ncolleges were closed, their order was dissolved, and they were\r\nexpelled from the kingdom with rigor and severity, in spite of the\r\nwishes of the king and many entreaties and tears from the zealous\r\nadvocates of Catholicism, and even of religious education.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suppression in Spain.]\r\n\r\nBut the Jesuits were too powerful, even in their misfortunes, to be\r\npersecuted without the effort to annihilate them. Having secured their\r\nexpulsion from France and Portugal, Choiseul and Pombal turned their\r\nattention to Spain, and so successfully intrigued, so artfully wrought\r\non the jealousy and fears of Charles\xc2\xa0III., that this weak prince\r\nfollowed the example of Joseph\xc2\xa0I. and Louis\xc2\xa0XV. But the king and his\r\nminister D\'Aranda, however, prosecuted their investigations with the\r\nutmost secrecy--did not even tell their allies of their movements. Of\r\ncourse, the Jesuits feared nothing from the king of Spain. But when\r\nhis measures were completed, an edict was suddenly declared, decreeing\r\nthe suppression of the order in the land of Inquisitions. The decree\r\ncame like a thunderbolt, but was instantly executed. "On the same day,\r\n2d April, 1767, and at the same hour, in Spain, in Africa, in Asia, in\r\nAmerica, and in all the islands belonging to the Spanish monarchy, the\r\nalcaldes of the towns opened their despatches from Madrid, by which\r\nthey were ordered, on pain of the severest penalties, immediately to\r\nenter the establishments of the Jesuits, to seize their persons, expel\r\nthem from their convents, and transport them, within twenty-four\r\nhours, to such places as were designated. Nor were the Jesuits\r\npermitted to carry away their money or their papers. Only a purse, a\r\nbreviary, and some apparel were given them."\r\n\r\nThe government feared a popular insurrection from an excitement so\r\nsudden, and a persecution so dreadful, and therefore issued express\r\nprohibition to all the ecclesiastical authorities to prevent any\r\nallusion to the event from the pulpit. All classes were required to\r\nmaintain absolute silence, and any controversy, or criticism, or\r\nremark was regarded as high treason. Such is despotism. Such is\r\nreligious persecution, when fear, as well as hatred, prompts to\r\ninjustice and cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits, in their misfortunes, managed with consummate craft.\r\nTheir policy was to appear in the light of victims of persecution.\r\nThere was to them no medium between reigning as despots or dying as\r\nmartyrs. Mediocrity would have degraded them. Ricci, the general of\r\nthe order, would not permit them to land in Italy, to which country\r\nthey were sent by the king of Spain. Six thousand priests, in misery\r\nand poverty, were sent adrift upon the Mediterranean, and after six\r\nmonths of vicissitude, suffering, and despair, they found a miserable\r\nrefuge on the Island of Corsica.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pope Clement\xc2\xa0XIV.]\r\n\r\nSoon after, the pope, their most powerful protector, died. A\r\nsuccessor was to be appointed. But France, Spain, and Portugal, bent\r\non the complete suppression of the Jesuits, resolved that no pope\r\nshould be elected who would not favor their end. A cardinal was\r\nfound,--Ganganelli,--who promised the ambassadors that, if elected\r\npope, he would abolish the order. They, accordingly, intrigued to\r\nsecure his election. The Jesuits, also, strained every nerve, and put\r\nforth marvellous talent and art, to secure a pope who would _protect\r\nthem_. But the ambassadors of the allied powers overreached even the\r\nJesuits. Ganganelli was the plainest, and, apparently, the most\r\nunambitious of men. His father had been a peasant; but, by the force\r\nof talent and learning, he had arisen, from the condition of his\r\nfather, to be a Roman cardinal. Under the garb of a saint, he aspired\r\nto the tiara. There was only one condition of success; and that was,\r\nto destroy the best supporters of that fearful absolutism which had so\r\nlong enslaved the world. The sacrifice was tremendous; but it was\r\nmade, and he became a pope. Then commenced in his soul the awful\r\nstruggle. Should he fulfil his pledge, and jeopardize his cause and\r\nthrone, and be branded, by the zealots of his church, with eternal\r\ninfamy? or should he break his word, and array against himself, with\r\nawful enmity, the great monarchs of Europe, and perhaps lose the\r\nallegiance of their subjects to him as the supreme head of the\r\nCatholic Church? The decision was the hardest which mortal man had\r\never been required to make. Whatever course he pursued was full of\r\ndanger and disgrace. Poor Ganganelli! he had better remained a\r\ncowherd, a simple priest, a bishop, a cardinal,--any thing,--rather\r\nthan to have been made a pope! But such was his ambition, and he was\r\nobliged to reap its penalty. Long did the afflicted pontiff delay to\r\nfulfil his pledge; long did he practise all the arts of dissimulation,\r\nof which he was such a master. He delayed, he flattered, he entreated,\r\nhe coaxed. But the monarchs called peremptorily for the fulfilment of\r\nhis pledge, and all Europe now understood the nature of the contest.\r\nIt was between the Jesuits and the monarchs of Europe. Ganganelli was\r\ncompelled to give his decision. His health declined, his spirits\r\nforsook him, his natural gayety fled. He courted solitude, he wept, he\r\nprayed. But he must, nevertheless, decide. The Jesuits threatened\r\nassassination, and exposed, with bitter eloquence, the ruin of his\r\nchurch, if he yielded her privileges to kings. And kings threatened\r\nsecession from Rome, deposition--ten thousand calamities. His agony\r\nbecame insupportable; but delay was no longer possible. He decided to\r\nsuppress the order of the Jesuits; and sixty-nine colleges were\r\nclosed, their missions were broken up, their churches were given to\r\ntheir rivals, and twenty-two thousand priests were left without\r\norganization, wealth, or power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Ganganelli.]\r\n\r\nTheir revenge was not an idle threat. One day, the pope, on arising\r\nfrom table, felt an internal shock, followed by great cold. Gradually\r\nhe lost his voice and strength. His blood became corrupted; and his\r\nmoral system gave way with the physical. He knew that he was\r\ndoomed--that he was poisoned--that he must die. The fear of hell was\r\nnow added to his other torments. "_Compulsus, feci, compulsus,\r\nfeci!_"--"O, mercy, mercy, I have been compelled!" he cried, and\r\ndied--died by that slow but sure poison, such as old Alexander\xc2\xa0VI.\r\nknew so well how to administer to his victims when he sought their\r\nwealth. Pope Clement\xc2\xa0XIV. inflicted, it was supposed, a mortal wound\r\nupon his church and upon her best friends. He, indeed, reaped the\r\npenalty of ambition; but the cause which he represented did not\r\nperish, nor will it lose vitality so long as the principle of evil on\r\nearth is destined to contend with the principle of good. On the\r\nrestoration of the Bourbons, the order of the Jesuits was restored;\r\nand their flaming sword, with its double edge, was again felt in every\r\ncorner of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Louis\xc2\xa0XV.]\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits, on their expulsion, found shelter in Prussia, and\r\nprotection from the royal infidel who had been the friend of Voltaire.\r\nA schism between the crowned heads of Europe and infidel philosophers\r\nhad taken place. Frederic, who had sympathized with their bitter\r\nmockery, at last perceived the tendency of their writings; that men\r\nwho assailed obedience to divine laws would not long respect the\r\ninstitutions and governments which mankind had recognized. He\r\nperceived, too, the natural union of absolutism in the church with\r\nabsolutism in the state, and came to the rescue of the great,\r\nunchanged, unchangeable, and ever-consistent advocates of despotism.\r\nThe frivolous Choiseul, the extravagant Pompadour, and the debauched\r\nSardanapalus of his age, did not perceive the truth which the King of\r\nPrussia recognized in his latter days. Nor would it have availed any\r\nthing, if they had been gifted with the clear insight of Frederic the\r\nGreat. The stream, on whose curious banks the great and the noble of\r\nFrance had been amusing themselves, soon swelled into an overwhelming\r\ntorrent. That devastating torrent was the French Revolution, whose\r\nawful swell was first perceived during the latter years of Louis\xc2\xa0XV.\r\nHe himself caught glimpses of the future; but, with the egotism of a\r\nBourbon, he remarked "that the throne would last during his time."\r\nSoon after this heartless speech was made, he was stricken with the\r\nsmall-pox, and died 1774, after a long and inglorious reign. He was\r\ndeserted in his last hours, and his disgusting and loathsome remains\r\nwere huddled into their last abode by the workmen of his palace.\r\n\r\nBefore the reign of Louis\xc2\xa0XVI. can be described, it is necessary to\r\nglance at the career of Frederic the Great, and the condition of the\r\nvarious European states, at a period contemporary with the Seven\r\nYears\' War--the great war of the eighteenth century, before the\r\nbreaking out of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--For a general view of the reign of Louis\xc2\xa0XV.,\r\n     see the histories of Lacretelle, Voltaire, and Crowe.

His singular character extorts\r\nour admiration, while it calls forth our aversion, admiration for his\r\ngreat abilities, sagacity, and self-reliance, and disgust for his\r\ncruelties, his malice, his suspicions, and his tricks. He had no faith\r\nin virtue or disinterestedness, and trusted only to mechanical\r\nagencies--to the power of armies--to the principle of fear. He was not\r\nindifferent to literature, or the improvement of his nation; but war\r\nwas alike his absorbing passion and his highest glory. Peter the Great\r\nwas half a barbarian, and Charles\xc2\xa0XII. half a madman; but Frederic was\r\nneither barbarous in his tastes, nor wild in his schemes. Louis\xc2\xa0XIV.\r\nplunged his nation in war from puerile egotism, and William\xc2\xa0III.\r\nfought for the great cause of religious and civil liberty; but\r\nFrederic, from the excitement which war produced, and the restless\r\nambition of plundering what was not his own.\r\n\r\nHe was born in the royal palace of Berlin, in 1712--ten years after\r\nPrussia had become a kingdom, and in the lifetime of his grandfather,\r\nFrederic\xc2\xa0I. The fortunes of his family were made by his\r\ngreat-grandfather, called the _Great Elector_, of the house of\r\nHohenzollern. He could not make Brandenburg a fertile province; so he\r\nturned it into a military state. He was wise, benignant, and\r\nuniversally beloved. But few of his amiable qualities were inherited\r\nby his great-grandson. Frederic\xc2\xa0II. resembled more his whimsical and\r\ntyrannical father, Frederic William, who beat his children without a\r\ncause, and sent his subjects to prison from mere caprice. When his\r\nambassador, in London, was allowed only one thousand pounds a year, he\r\ngave a bounty of thirteen hundred pounds to a tall Irishman, to join\r\nhis famous body-guard, a regiment of men who were each over six feet\r\nhigh. He would kick women in the streets, abuse clergymen for looking\r\non the soldiers, and insult his son\'s tutor for teaching him Latin.\r\nBut, abating his coarseness, his brutality, and his cruelty, he was a\r\nChristian, after a certain model. He had respect for the institutions\r\nof religion, denounced all amusements as sinful, and read a sermon\r\naloud, every afternoon, to his family. His son perceived his\r\ninconsistencies, and grew up an infidel. There was no sympathy between\r\nfather and son, and the father even hated the heir of his house and\r\nthrone. The young prince was kept on bread and water; his most\r\nmoderate wishes were disregarded; he was surrounded with spies; he was\r\ncruelly beaten and imprisoned, and abused as a monster and a heathen.\r\nThe cruel treatment which the prince received induced him to fly; his\r\nflight was discovered; he was brought back to Berlin, condemned to\r\ndeath as a deserter and only saved from the fate of a malefactor by\r\nthe intercession of half of the crowned heads of Europe. A hollow\r\nreconciliation was effected; and the prince was permitted, at last, to\r\nretire to one of the royal palaces, where he amused himself with\r\nbooks, billiards, balls, and banquets. He opened a correspondence with\r\nVoltaire, and became an ardent admirer of his opinions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accession of Frederic the Great.]\r\n\r\nIn 1740, the old king died, and Frederic\xc2\xa0II. mounted an absolute\r\nthrone. He found a well filled treasury, and a splendidly disciplined\r\narmy. His customary pleasures were abandoned, and dreams of glory\r\nfilled his ambitious soul.\r\n\r\nScarcely was he seated on his throne before military aggrandizement\r\nbecame the animating principle of his life.\r\n\r\nHis first war was the conquest of Silesia, one of the richest\r\nprovinces of the Austrian empire. It belonged to Maria Theresa, Queen\r\nof Hungary and Bohemia, daughter of the late emperor of Germany, whose\r\nsuccession was guaranteed by virtue of the Pragmatic Sanction--a law\r\nwhich the Emperor Charles passed respecting his daughter\'s claim, and\r\nwhich claim was recognized by the old king of Prussia, and ratified by\r\nall the leading powers of Europe. Without a declaration of war,\r\nwithout complaints, without a cause, scarcely without a pretext, from\r\nthe mere lust of dominion, Frederic commenced hostilities, in the\r\ndepth of winter, when invasion was unexpected, and when the garrisons\r\nwere defenceless. Without a battle, one of the oldest provinces of\r\nAustria was seized, and the royal robber returned in triumph to his\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nSuch an outrage and crime astonished and alarmed the whole civilized\r\nworld, and Europe armed itself to revenge and assist the unfortunate\r\nqueen, whose empire was threatened with complete dismemberment.\r\nFrederic was alarmed, and a hollow peace was made. But, in two years,\r\nthe war again broke out. To recover Silesia and to humble Frederic was\r\nthe aim of Maria Theresa. She succeeded in securing the co\xc3\xb6peration of\r\nRussia, France, Sweden, and Saxony. No one doubted of the ruin of the\r\nhouse of Brandenburg. Six hundred thousand men were arrayed to crush\r\nan upstart monarchy, and an unprincipled king, who had trampled on all\r\nthe laws of nations and all the principles of justice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Seven Years\' War.]\r\n\r\nThe resistance of Frederic to these immense forces constitutes the\r\ncelebrated _Seven Years\' War_--the most gigantic war which Europe had\r\nseen, from the Reformation to the French Revolution. This contest\r\nbegan during the latter years of George\xc2\xa0II., and was connected with\r\nthe colonial wars of Great Britain and France, during which Wolfe was\r\nkilled and the Canadas were gained. This war called out all the\r\nenergies of the elder Pitt, and placed Great Britain on the exalted\r\nheight which it has since retained.\r\n\r\nFrederic was not so blinded as not to perceive the extent of his\r\ndangers; and his successful resistance to the armies which his own\r\noffensive war had raised up against him, has given him his claims to\r\nthe epithet of _Great_. Although he provoked the war, his successful\r\ndefence of his country placed him on the very highest pinnacle of\r\nmilitary fame. He would gladly have been relieved from the contest,\r\nbut it was inevitable; and when the tempest burst upon his head, he\r\nshowed all the qualities of exalted heroism.\r\n\r\nGreat and overwhelming odds were arrayed against him. But he himself\r\nhad some great advantages. He was absolute master of his army, of his\r\ntreasury, and of his territories. The lives and property of his\r\nsubjects were at his disposal; his subjects were brave and loyal; he\r\nwas popular with the people, and was sustained by the enthusiasm of\r\nthe nation; his army was well disciplined; he had no sea-coast to\r\ndefend, and he could concentrate all his forces upon any point he\r\npleased, in a short time.\r\n\r\nHis only hope was in energetic measures. He therefore invaded Saxony,\r\nat once, with sixty thousand men. His aim was to seize the state\r\npapers at Dresden, which contained the proofs of the confederation.\r\nThese were found and published, which showed that now, at least, he\r\nacted on the defensive.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1756 commenced, and the first great battle was won by\r\nthe Prussians. By the victory of Lowositz, Frederic was in a better\r\ncondition to contend with Austria. By this he got possession of\r\nSaxony.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1757 was commenced under great solicitude. Five\r\nhundred thousand men were arrayed against two hundred thousand. Near\r\nPrague, Frederic obtained a victory, but lost twelve thousand men. He\r\nthen invested Prague. General Daun, with a superior army, advanced to\r\nits relief. Another bloody battle was fought, and lost by the Prussian\r\nking. This seemed to be a fatal stroke. At the outset, as it were, of\r\nthe war, he had received a check. The soldiers\' confidence was\r\nweakened. Malevolent sarcasm pointed out mistakes. The siege of Prague\r\nwas raised, and Bohemia was abandoned. A French army, at the same\r\ntime, invaded Germany; and Frederic heard also of the death of his\r\nmother--the only person whom he loved. His spirits fell, and he became\r\nhaggard and miserable.\r\n\r\nThe only thing for him to do now was, to protect Saxony, and secure\r\nthat conquest--no very easy task. His dominions were now assailed by a\r\nFrench, a Swedish, and a Russian army. His capital was in the hands of\r\nthe Croatians, and he was opposed by superior Austrian forces. No\r\nwonder that he was oppressed with melancholy, and saw only the ruin of\r\nhis house. On one thing, however, he was resolved--never to be taken\r\nalive. So he provided himself with poison, which he ever carried about\r\nhis person.\r\n\r\nThe heroic career of Frederic dates from this hour of misfortune and\r\ntrial. Indeed, the heroism of all great men commences in perplexity,\r\ndifficulty, and danger. Success is glorious; but success is obtained\r\nonly through struggle. Frederic\'s career is a splendid example of that\r\nheroism which rises above danger, and extricates a man from\r\ndifficulties when his cause is desperate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Rossbach.]\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia first marched against the French. The two armies\r\nmet at Rossbach. The number of the French was double that of the\r\nPrussians; but the Prussians were better disciplined, and were\r\ncommanded by an abler general. The French, however felt secure of\r\nvictory; but they were defeated: seven thousand men were taken\r\nprisoners, together with their guns, ammunition, parrots, hair powder,\r\nand pomatum. The victory of Rossbach won for Frederic a great name,\r\nand diffused universal joy among the English and Prussians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Leuthen.]\r\n\r\nAfter a brief rest, he turned his face towards Silesia, which had\r\nagain fallen into the hands of the Austrians. It was for this province\r\nthat he provoked the hostilities of Europe; and pride, as well as\r\ninterest, induced him to bend all his energies to regain it. Prince\r\nCharles of Lorraine commanded the forces of Maria Theresa, which\r\nnumbered eighty thousand men. Frederic could only array against him an\r\narmy of thirty thousand. And yet, in spite of the disparity of forces,\r\nand his desperate condition, he resolved to attack the enemy. His\r\ngenerals remonstrated; but the hero gave full permission to all to\r\nretire, if they pleased. None were found to shun the danger. Frederic,\r\nlike Napoleon, had the talent of exciting the enthusiasm of his\r\ntroops. He both encouraged and threatened them. He declared that any\r\ncavalry regiment which did not, on being ordered, burst impetuously on\r\nthe foe, should after the battle, be dismounted, and converted into a\r\ngarrison regiment. But he had no reason to complain. On the 5th of\r\nDecember, the day of the ever-memorable battle of Leuthen, he selected\r\nan officer with fifty men as his body-guard. "I shall," said he,\r\n"expose myself much to-day; you are not to leave me for an instant: if\r\nI fall, cover me quickly with a mantle, place me in a wagon and tell\r\nthe fact to no one. The battle cannot be avoided, and must be won."\r\nAnd he obtained a glorious victory. The Austrian general abandoned a\r\nstrong position, because he deemed it beneath his dignity to contend\r\nwith an inferior force in a fortified camp. His imprudence lost him\r\nthe battle. According to Napoleon, it was a masterpiece on the part of\r\nthe victor, and placed him in the first rank of generals. Twenty\r\nthousand Austrians were either killed or taken. Breslau opened its\r\ngates to the Prussians, and Silesia was reconquered. The king\'s fame\r\nfilled the world. Pictures of him were hung in almost every house. The\r\nenthusiasm of Germany was not surpassed by that of England. London was\r\nilluminated; the gay scions of aristocracy proposed to the Prussian\r\nking to leave their country and join his army; an annual subsidy of\r\nseven hundred thousand pounds was granted by government. The battle of\r\nLeuthen was the most brilliant in Prussian annals; out the battle of\r\nRossbach, over the French, was attended by greater moral results. It\r\nshowed, for the first time for several centuries, that the Germans\r\nwere really a great people, and were a match for the French, hitherto\r\ndeemed invincible.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1758, Frederic was ready for a new campaign,\r\nwhich was soon signalized by a great victory over the Russians, at\r\nZorndorff. It was as brilliant and decisive as the battles of Rossbach\r\nand Leuthen. A force of thirty-two thousand men defeated an army of\r\nfifty-two thousand. Twenty-two thousand Russians lay dead on the\r\nfield. This victory placed Frederic at the zenith of military fame. In\r\nless than a year, he had defeated three great armies; in less than a\r\nyear, and when nearly driven to despair,--when his cause seemed\r\nhopeless, and his enemies were rejoicing in their strength,--he\r\nsuccessively triumphed over the French, the Austrians, and the\r\nRussians; the three most powerful nations on the continent of Europe.\r\nAnd his moderation after victory was as marked as his self-reliance\r\nafter defeat. At this period, he stood out, to the wondering and\r\nadmiring eyes of the world, as the greatest hero and general of modern\r\ntimes. But, after this, his career was more checkered, and he was\r\nstill in danger of being overwhelmed by his powerful enemies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Dresden.]\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the campaign of 1758 was spent in driving the\r\nAustrians from Silesia, and in capturing Dresden. No capital in Europe\r\nhas suffered more in war than this elegant and polished city. It has\r\nbeen often besieged and taken, but the victors have always spared its\r\nfamous picture gallery--the finest collection of the works of the old\r\nmasters, probably, in existence.\r\n\r\nBut Frederic was now assailed by a new enemy, Pope Benedict\xc2\xa0XIV. He\r\nsent a consecrated sword, a hat of crimson velvet, and a dove of\r\npearls,--"the mystic symbol of the divine Comforter,"--to Marshal\r\nDaun, the ablest of the Austrian generals, and the conqueror at Kolin\r\nand Hochkirchen. It was the rarest of the papal gifts, and had been\r\nonly bestowed, in the course of six centuries, on Godfrey of Bouillon,\r\nby Urban\xc2\xa0II., when he took Jerusalem; on Alva, after his massacres in\r\nHolland; and on Sobieski, after his deliverance of Vienna, when\r\nbesieged by the Turks. It had never been conferred, except for the\r\ndefence of the "Holy Catholic Church." But this greatest of papal\r\ngifts made no impression on the age which read Montesquieu and\r\nVoltaire. A flood of satirical pamphlets inundated Christendom, and\r\nthe world laughed at the impotent weapons which had once been\r\nthunderbolts in the hands of Hildebrand or Innocent\xc2\xa0III.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reverses of Frederic.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth year of the war proved disastrous to Frederic. He did not\r\nlose military reputation, but he lost his cities and armies. The\r\nforces of his enemies were nearly overwhelming. The Austrians invaded\r\nSaxony, and menaced Silesia, while the Russians gained a victory over\r\nthe Prussians at Kunersdorf, and killed eighteen thousand men. The\r\nRussians did not improve this great victory over Frederic, which\r\nnearly drove him to despair. But he rallied, and was again defeated in\r\nthree disastrous battles. In his distress, he fed his troops on\r\npotatoes and rye bread, took from the peasant his last horse, debased\r\nhis coin, and left his civil functionaries unpaid.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1760 was, at first, unfavorable to the Prussians.\r\nFrederic had only ninety thousand men, and his enemies had two hundred\r\nthousand, in the field. He was therefore obliged to maintain the\r\ndefensive. But still disasters thickened. General Loudon obtained a\r\ngreat victory over his general, Fouqu\xc3\xa9, in Silesia. Instead of being\r\ndiscouraged by this new defeat, he formed the extraordinary resolution\r\nof wresting Dresden from the hands of the Austrians. But he pretended\r\nto retreat from Saxony, and advance to Silesia. General Daun was\r\ndeceived, and decoyed from Saxony in pursuit of him. As soon as\r\nFrederic had retired a considerable distance from Dresden, he\r\nreturned, and bombarded it. But he did not succeed in taking it, and\r\nwas forced to retreat to Silesia. It was there his good fortune to\r\ngain a victory over the Austrians, and prevent their junction with the\r\nRussians. At Torgau, he again defeated an army of sixty-four thousand\r\nof the enemy, with a force of only forty-four thousand. This closed\r\nthe campaign, and the position of the parties was nearly the same as\r\nat the commencement of it. The heart of Frederic was now ulcerated\r\nwith bitterness in view of the perseverance of his enemies, who were\r\nresolved to crush him. He should, however, have remembered that he had\r\nprovoked their implacable resentment, by the commission of a great\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nAlthough Frederic, by rare heroism, had maintained his ground, still\r\nhis resources were now nearly exhausted, and he began to look around,\r\nin vain, for a new supply of men, horses, and provisions. The circle\r\nwhich his enemies had drawn around him was obviously becoming smaller.\r\nIn a little while, to all appearance, he would be crushed by\r\noverwhelming forces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continued Disasters.]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the campaign in 1761 was opened; but no\r\nevent of importance occurred until nearly the close of the year. On\r\nthe whole, it was disastrous to Prussia. Half of Silesia was taken by\r\nthe Austrians, and the Russian generals were successful in Pomerania.\r\nAnd a still greater misfortune happened to Frederic in consequence of\r\nthe resignation of Pitt, who had ever been his firmest ally, and had\r\ngranted him large subsidies, when he was most in need of them. On the\r\nretirement of the English minister, these subsidies were withdrawn,\r\nand the party which had thwarted William\xc2\xa0III., which had persecuted\r\nMarlborough, and had given up the Catalans, came into power--the\r\nTories. "It was indifferent to them whether the house of Hohenstaufen\r\nor Hohenzollern should be dominant in Germany." But Pitt and the Whigs\r\nargued that no sacrifice would be too great to preserve the balance of\r\npower. The defection of England, however, filled the mind of Frederic\r\nwith implacable hatred, and he never could bear to hear even the name\r\nof England mentioned. The defection of this great ally made his\r\naffairs desperate; and no one, taking a dispassionate view of the\r\ncontending parties, could doubt but that the ruin of the Prussian king\r\nwas inevitable. Maria Theresa was so confident of success, that she\r\ndisbanded twenty thousand of her troops.\r\n\r\nBut Providence had ordered otherwise. A great and unexpected change\r\ncame over the fortunes of Frederic. His heroism was now to be\r\nrewarded--not the vulgar heroism which makes a sudden effort, and\r\ngains a single battle, but that well-sustained heroism which strives\r\nin the midst of defeat, and continues to hope when even noble hearts\r\nare sinking in despair. On the 5th of January, 1762, Elizabeth, the\r\nempress of Russia, died; and her successor, Peter\xc2\xa0III., who was an\r\nadmirer of Frederic, and even a personal friend, returned the Prussian\r\nprisoners, withdrew his troops from the Prussian territories, dressed\r\nhimself in a Prussian uniform, and wore the black eagle of Prussia on\r\nhis breast. He even sent fifteen thousand troops to re\xc3\xabnforce the army\r\nof Frederic.\r\n\r\nEngland and France had long been wearied of this war, and formed a\r\nseparate treaty for themselves. Prussia and Austria were therefore\r\nleft to combat each other. If Austria, assisted by France and Russia,\r\ncould not regain Silesia and ruin Prussia, it certainly was not strong\r\nenough to conquer Frederic single-handed. The proud Maria Theresa was\r\ncompelled to make peace with that heroic but unprincipled robber, who\r\nhad seized one of the finest provinces of the Austrian empire. In\r\nFebruary, the treaty of Hubertsburg was signed, by which Frederic\r\nretained his spoil. He, in comparison with the other belligerent\r\nparties was the gainer. But no acquisition of territory could\r\ncompensate for those seven years of toil, expense, and death. After\r\nsix years, he entered his capital in triumph; but he beheld every\r\nwhere the melancholy marks of devastation and suffering. The fields\r\nwere untilled, houses had been sacked, population had declined, and\r\nfamine and disease had spread a funereal shade over the dwellings of\r\nthe poor. He had escaped death, but one sixth of the whole male\r\npopulation of Prussia had been killed, and untold millions of property\r\nhad been destroyed. In some districts, no laborers but women were seen\r\nin the fields, and fifteen thousand houses had been burnt in his own\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exhaustion of Prussia by the War.]\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable that no national debt was incurred by the king\r\nof Prussia, in spite of all his necessities. He always, in the worst\r\nof times, had a year\'s revenue in advance; and, at the close of the\r\nwar, to show the world that he was not then impoverished, he built a\r\nsplendid palace at Potsdam, which nearly equalled the magnificence of\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\nBut he also did all in his power to alleviate the distress which his\r\nwars had caused. Silesia received three millions of thalers, and\r\nPomerania two millions. Fourteen thousand houses were rebuilt;\r\ntreasury notes, which had depreciated, were redeemed; officers who had\r\ndistinguished themselves were rewarded; and the widows and children of\r\nthose who had fallen were pensioned.\r\n\r\nThe possession of Silesia did not, indeed, compensate for the Seven\r\nYears\' War; but the struggles which the brave Prussians made for their\r\nnational independence, when assailed on all sides by powerful enemies,\r\nwere not made in vain. Had they not been made, worse evils would have\r\nhappened. Prussia would not have held her place in the scale of\r\nnations, and the people would have fallen in self-respect. It was\r\nwrong in Frederic to seize the possession of another. In so doing, he\r\nwas in no respect better than a robber: and he paid a penalty for his\r\ncrime. But he also fought in self-defence. This defence was honorable\r\nand glorious, and this entitles him to the name of _Great_.\r\n\r\nAfter the peace of Hubertsburg, in 1763, Prussia, for a time, enjoyed\r\nrepose, and the king devoted himself to the improvement of his\r\ncountry. But the army received his greatest consideration, and a peace\r\nestablishment of one hundred and sixty thousand men was maintained; an\r\nimmense force for so small a kingdom, but deemed necessary in such\r\nunsettled times. Frederic amused himself in building palaces, in\r\nwriting books, and corresponding with literary friends. But schemes of\r\nambition were, after all, paramount in his mind.\r\n\r\nThe Seven Years\' War had scarcely closed before the partition of\r\nPoland was effected, the greatest political crime of that age, for\r\nwhich the king of Prussia was chiefly responsible.\r\n\r\nThe Bavarian war was the next great political event of importance\r\nwhich occurred during the reign of Frederic. The emperor of Germany\r\nformed a project for the dismemberment of the electorate of Bavaria.\r\nThe liberties of the Germanic body were in danger, and Frederic came\r\nto the rescue. On this occasion, he was the opposer of lawless\r\nambition. In 1778, he took the field with a powerful army; but no\r\naction ensued. The Austrian court found it expedient to abandon the\r\ndesign, and the peace of Teschen prevented another fearful contest.\r\nThe two last public acts of Frederic were the establishment, in 1785,\r\nof the Germanic Union for preserving the constitution of the empire,\r\nand a treaty of amity and commerce, in 1786, with the United States of\r\nAmerica, which was a model of liberal policy respecting the rights of\r\nindependent nations, both in peace and war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Frederic.]\r\n\r\nHe died on the 17th of August, 1786, in the seventy-fifth year of his\r\nage, and the forty-seventh of his reign. On the whole, he was one of\r\nthe most remarkable men of his age, and had a great influence on the\r\ncondition of his country.\r\n\r\nHis distinguishing peculiarity was his admiration of, and devotion to,\r\nthe military profession, which he unduly exalted. An ensign in his\r\narmy ranked higher than a counsellor of legation or a professor of\r\nphilosophy. His ordinary mode of life was simple and unostentatious,\r\nand his favorite residence was the palace of Sans Souci, at Potsdam.\r\nHe was very fond of music, and of the society of literary men; but he\r\nmortified them by his patronizing arrogance, and worried them by his\r\npractical jokes. His favorite literary companions were infidel\r\nphilosophers, and Voltaire received from him marks of the highest\r\ndistinction. But the king of letters could not live with the despot\r\nwho solicited his society, and an implacable hatred succeeded\r\nfamiliarity and friendship. The king had considerable literary\r\nreputation, and was the author of several works. He was much admired\r\nby his soldiers, and permitted in them uncommon familiarity. He was\r\never free from repulsive formality and bolstered dignity. He was\r\nindustrious, frugal, and vigilant. Nothing escaped his eye, and he\r\nattended to the details of his administration. He was probably the\r\nmost indefatigable sovereign that ever existed, but displayed more\r\npersonal ability than enlarged wisdom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Frederic.]\r\n\r\nBut able and successful as he was as a ruler, he was one of those men\r\nfor whom it is impossible to entertain a profound respect. He was\r\ncruel, selfish, and parsimonious. He was prodigal of the blood of his\r\nsubjects, and ungenerous in his treatment of those who had sacrificed\r\nevery thing for his sake. He ruled by fear rather than by love. He\r\nintroduced into every department the precision of a rigid military\r\ndiscipline, and had no faith in any power but that of mechanical\r\nagencies. He quarrelled with his best friends, and seemed to enjoy the\r\nmiseries he inflicted. He was contemptuous of woman, and disdainful of\r\nChristianity. His egotism was not redeemed by politeness or\r\naffability, and he made no efforts to disguise his unmitigated\r\nselfishness and heartless injustice. He had no loftiness of character,\r\nand no appreciation of elevation of sentiment in others. He worshipped\r\nonly himself and rewarded those only who advanced his ambitious\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--The Posthumous Works of Frederic\xc2\xa0II.

The part which Maria Theresa took in\r\nthe Seven Years\' War has been often alluded to and it is not necessary\r\nto recapitulate the causes or events of that war. She and\r\nCatharine\xc2\xa0II. were also implicated with Frederic in the partition of\r\nPoland. The misfortunes of that unhappy country will be separately\r\nconsidered. In alluding to Maria Theresa, we cannot but review the\r\nhistory of that great empire over which she ruled, the most powerful\r\nof the German states. The power of Austria, at different times since\r\nthe death of the Emperor Charles\xc2\xa0V., threatened the liberties of\r\nEurope; and, to prevent her ascendency, the kings of France, England,\r\nand Prussia have expended the treasure and wasted the blood of their\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Germanic Constitution.]\r\n\r\nBy the peace of Westphalia, in 1648, at the close of the Thirty Years\'\r\nWar, the constitution of Germany was established upon a firm basis.\r\nThe religious differences between the Catholics and the Protestants\r\nwere settled, and religious toleration secured in all the states of\r\nthe empire. It was settled that no decree of the Diet was to pass\r\nwithout a majority of suffrages, and that the Imperial Chamber and the\r\nAulic Council should be composed of a due proportion of Catholics and\r\nProtestants. The former was instituted by the Emperor Maximilian\xc2\xa0I.,\r\nin 1495, at the Diet of Worms, and was a judicial tribunal, and the\r\nhighest court of appeal. It consisted of seventeen judges nominated by\r\nthe emperor, and took cognizance of Austrian affairs chiefly. The\r\nAulic Council was also judicial, and was composed of eighteen persons\r\nand attended chiefly to business connected with the empire. The\r\nmembers of these two great judicial tribunals were Catholics; and\r\nthere were also frequent disputes between them as to their respective\r\njurisdictions. It was ordained by the treaty of Westphalia that a\r\nperfect equality should be observed in the appointment of the members\r\nof these two important courts; but, in fact, twenty-four Protestants\r\nand twenty-six Catholics were appointed to the Imperial Chamber. The\r\nvarious states had the right of presenting members, according to\r\npolitical importance. The Aulic Council was composed of six\r\nProtestants and twelve Catholics, and was a tribunal to settle\r\ndifficulties between the various states of which Germany was composed.\r\n\r\nThese states were nearly independent of each other, but united under\r\none common head. Each state had its own peculiar government, which was\r\ngenerally monarchical, and regulated its own coinage, police, and\r\nadministration of justice. Each kingdom, electorate, principality, and\r\nimperial city, which were included in the states of Germany, had the\r\nright to make war, form alliances, conclude peace, and send\r\nambassadors to foreign courts.\r\n\r\nThe Diet of the empire consisted of representatives of each of the\r\nstates, appointed by the princes themselves, and took cognizance of\r\nmatters of common interest, such as regulations respecting commerce,\r\nthe license of books, and the military force which each state was\r\nrequired to furnish.\r\n\r\nThe emperor had power, in some respects, over all these states; but it\r\nwas chiefly confined to his hereditary dominions. He could not\r\nexercise any despotic control over the various princes of the empire;\r\nbut, as hereditary sovereign of Austria, Styria, Moravia, Bohemia,\r\nHungary, and the Tyrol, he was the most powerful prince in Europe\r\nuntil the aggrandisement of Louis\xc2\xa0XIV.\r\n\r\nFerdinand\xc2\xa0III. was emperor of Germany at the peace of Westphalia; but\r\nhe did not long survive it. He died in 1657, and his son Leopold\r\nsucceeded him as sovereign of all the Austrian dominions. He had not\r\ncompleted his eighteenth year, but nevertheless was, five months\r\nafter, elected Emperor of Germany by the Electoral Diet.\r\n\r\nGreat events occurred during the reign of Leopold\xc2\xa0I.--the Turkish war,\r\nthe invasion of the Netherlands by Louis\xc2\xa0XIV., the heroic struggles of\r\nthe Prince of Orange, the French invasion of the Palatinate, the\r\naccession of a Bourbon prince to the throne of Spain, the discontents\r\nof Hungary, and the victories of Marlborough and Eugene. Most of these\r\nhave been already alluded to, especially in the chapter on Louis\xc2\xa0XIV.,\r\nand, therefore, will not be further discussed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Hungarian War.]\r\n\r\nThe most important event connected with Austrian affairs, as distinct\r\nfrom those of France, England, and Holland, was the Hungarian war.\r\nHungary was not a province of Austria, but was a distinct state. In\r\n1526, the crowns of the two kingdoms were united, like those of\r\nEngland and Hanover under George\xc2\xa0I. But the Hungarians were always\r\nimpatient of the rule of the Emperor of Germany, and, in the space of\r\na century, arose five times in defence of their liberties.\r\n\r\nIn 1667, one of these insurrections took place, occasioned by the\r\naggressive policy and government of Leopold. The Hungarians conspired\r\nto secure their liberties, but in vain. So soon as the emperor was\r\naware of the conspiracy of his Hungarian subjects, he adopted vigorous\r\nmeasures, quartered thirty thousand additional troops in Hungary,\r\nloaded the people with taxes, occupied the principal fortresses,\r\nbanished the chiefs, and changed the constitution of the country. He\r\nalso attempted to suppress Protestantism, and committed all the\r\nexcesses of a military despotism. These accumulated oppressions drove\r\na brave but turbulent people to despair, and both Catholics and\r\nProtestants united for their common safety. The insurgents were\r\nassisted by the Prince of Transylvania, and were supplied with money\r\nand provisions by the French. They also found a noble defender in\r\nEmeric Tekeli, a young Hungarian noble, who hated Austria as intensely\r\nas Hannibal hated Rome, and who, at the head of twenty thousand men,\r\ndefended his country against the emperor. Moreover, he successfully\r\nintrigued with the Turks, who invaded Hungary with two hundred\r\nthousand men, and advanced to lay siege to Vienna. This immense army\r\nwas defeated by John Sobieski, to whom Leopold appealed in his\r\nnecessities, and the Turks were driven out of Hungary. Tekeli was\r\ngradually insulated from those who had formed the great support of his\r\ncause, and, in consequence of jealousies which Leopold had fomented\r\nbetween him and the Turks, was arrested and sent in chains to\r\nConstantinople. New victories followed the imperial army, and Leopold\r\nsucceeded in making the crown of Hungary, hitherto elective,\r\nhereditary in his family. He instituted in the conquered country a\r\nhorrible inquisitorial tribunal, and perpetrated cruelties which\r\nscarcely find a parallel in the proscriptions of Marius and Sylla. His\r\nson Joseph, at the age of ten, was crowned king of Hungary with great\r\nmagnificence, and with the usual solemnities.\r\n\r\nWhen the Hungarian difficulties were settled, Leopold had more leisure\r\nto prosecute his war with the Turks, in which he gained signal\r\nsuccesses. The Ottoman Porte was humbled and crippled, and a great\r\nsource of discontent to the Christian powers of Europe was removed. By\r\nthe peace of Carlovitz, (1697,) Leopold secured Hungary and Sclavonia,\r\nwhich had been so long occupied by the Turks, and consolidated his\r\nempire by the acquisition of Transylvania.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Emperor Joseph.]\r\n\r\nLeopold\xc2\xa0I. lived only to witness the splendid victories of Marlborough\r\nand Eugene, by which the power of his great rival, Louis, was\r\neffectually reduced. He died in 1705, having reigned forty-six years;\r\nthe longest reign in the Austrian annals, except that of Frederic\xc2\xa0III.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of great private virtues; pure in his morals, faithful to\r\nhis wife, a good father, and a kind master. He was minute in his\r\ndevotions, unbounded in his charities, and cultivated in his taste.\r\nBut he was reserved, cold, and phlegmatic. His jealousy of Sobieski\r\nwas unworthy of his station, and his severities in Hungary made him\r\nthe object of execration. He was narrow, bigoted, and selfish. But he\r\nlived in an age of great activity, and his reign forms an era in the\r\nmilitary and civil institutions of his country. The artillery had been\r\ngradually lightened, and received most of the improvements which at\r\npresent are continued. Bayonets had been added to muskets, and the use\r\nof pikes abandoned. Armies were increased from twenty or thirty\r\nthousand men to one hundred thousand, more systematically formed. A\r\npolice was established in the cities, and these were lighted and\r\npaved. Jurisprudence was improved, and numerous grievances were\r\nredressed.\r\n\r\nLeopold was succeeded by his eldest son, Joseph, who had an energetic\r\nand aspiring mind. His reign is memorable for the continuation of the\r\ngreat War of the Spanish Succession, signalized by the victories of\r\nMarlborough and Eugene, the humiliation of the French, and the career\r\nof Charles\xc2\xa0XII. of Sweden. He also restored Bohemia to its electoral\r\nrights, rewarded the elector palatine with the honors and territories\r\nwrested from his family by the Thirty Years\' War, and confirmed the\r\nhouse of Hanover in the possession of the ninth electorate. He had\r\nnearly restored tranquillity to his country, when he died (1711) of\r\nthe small-pox--a victim to the ignorance of his physicians. He was a\r\nlover and patron of the arts, and spoke several languages with\r\nelegance and fluency. But he had the usual faults of absolute princes;\r\nwas prodigal in his expenditures, irascible in his temper, fond of\r\npageants and pleasure, and enslaved by women.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accession of Maria Theresa.]\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by his brother, the Archduke Charles, under the title\r\nof Charles\xc2\xa0VI. Soon after his accession, the tranquillity of Europe\r\nwas established by the peace of Utrecht, and Austria once more became\r\nthe preponderating power in Europe. But Charles\xc2\xa0VI. was not capable of\r\nappreciating the greatness of his position, or the true sources of\r\nnational power. He, however, devoted himself zealously to the affairs\r\nof his empire, and effected some useful reforms. As he had no male\r\nissue, he had drawn up a solemn law, called the _Pragmatic Sanction_,\r\naccording to which he transferred to his daughter, Maria Theresa, his\r\nvast hereditary possessions. He found great difficulty in securing the\r\nassent of the European powers to this law; but, after a while, he\r\neffected his object. On his death, (1740,) Maria Theresa succeeded to\r\nall the dominions of the house of Austria.\r\n\r\nNo princess ever ascended a throne under circumstances of greater\r\nperil, or in a situation which demanded greater energy and fortitude.\r\nHer army had dwindled to thirty thousand; her treasury contained only\r\none hundred thousand florins; a general scarcity of provisions\r\ndistressed the people, and the vintage was cut off by the frost.\r\n\r\nUnder all these embarrassing circumstances, the Elector of Bavaria\r\nlaid claim to her territory, and Frederic\xc2\xa0II. marched into Silesia. It\r\nhas been already stated that England sympathized with her troubles,\r\nand lent a generous aid. Her appeal to her Hungarian subjects, and the\r\nenthusiasm they manifested in her cause, have also been described. The\r\nboldness of Frederic and the distress of Maria Theresa drew upon them\r\nthe eyes of all Europe. Hostilities were prosecuted four years, which\r\nresulted in the acquisition of Silesia by the King of Prussia. The\r\npeace of Dresden (1745) gave a respite to Germany, and Frederic and\r\nMaria Theresa prepared for new conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe Seven Years\' War has been briefly described, in connection with\r\nthe reign of Frederic, and need not be further discussed. The war was\r\nonly closed by the exhaustion of all the parties engaged in it.\r\n\r\nIn 1736, Maria Theresa was married to Francis Stephen, Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany, and he was elected (1745) Emperor of Germany, under the title\r\nof _Francis\xc2\xa0I._ He died soon after the peace of Hubertsburg was\r\nsigned, and his son Joseph succeeded to the throne of the empire, and\r\nwas co-regent, as his father had been, with Maria Theresa. But the\r\nempress queen continued to be the real, as she was the legitimate,\r\nsovereign of Austria, and took an active part in all the affairs of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maria Theresa Institutes Reforms.]\r\n\r\nWhen the tranquillity of her kingdom was restored, she founded various\r\ncolleges, reformed the public schools, promoted agriculture and\r\ninstituted many beneficial regulations for the prosperity of her\r\nsubjects. She reformed the church, diminished the number of\r\nsuperfluous clergy, suppressed the Inquisition and the Jesuits, and\r\nformed a system of military economy which surpassed the boasted\r\narrangements of Frederic\xc2\xa0II. "She combined private economy with public\r\nliberality, dignity with condescension, elevation of soul with\r\nhumility of spirit, and the virtues of domestic life with the splendid\r\nqualities which grace a throne." Her death, in 1780, was felt as a\r\ngeneral loss to the people, who adored her; and her reign is\r\nconsidered as one of the most illustrious in Austrian annals.\r\n\r\nHer reign was, however, sullied by the partition of Poland, in which\r\nshe was concerned with Frederic the Great and Catharine\xc2\xa0II. Before\r\nthis is treated, we will consider the reign of the Russian empress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reign of Catharine\xc2\xa0II., like that of Maria Theresa, is interlinked\r\nwith that of Frederic. But some remarks concerning her predecessors,\r\nafter the death of Peter the Great, are first necessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Successors of Peter the Great.]\r\n\r\nCatharine, the wife of Peter, was crowned empress before his death.\r\nThe first years of her reign were agreeable to the people, because she\r\ndiminished the taxes, and introduced a mild policy in the government\r\nof her subjects. She intrusted to Prince Menzikoff an important share\r\nin the government of the realm.\r\n\r\nBut Catharine, who, during the reign of Peter\xc2\xa0I., had displayed so\r\nmuch enterprise and intrepidity, very soon disdained business, and\r\nabandoned herself to luxury and pleasure. She died in 1727, and\r\nPeter\xc2\xa0II. ascended her throne, chiefly in consequence of the intrigues\r\nof Menzikoff, who, like Richelieu, wished to make the emperor his\r\npuppet.\r\n\r\nPeter\xc2\xa0II. was only thirteen years of age when he became emperor. He\r\nwas the son of Alexis, and, consequently, grandson of Peter\xc2\xa0I. His\r\nyouth did not permit him to assume the reins of government, and every\r\nthing was committed to the care of Menzikoff, who reigned, for a time,\r\nwith absolute power. But he, at last, incurred the displeasure of his\r\nyouthful master, and was exiled to Siberia. But Peter\xc2\xa0II. did not long\r\nsurvive the disgrace of his minister. He died of the small-pox, in\r\n1730.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Anne, Duchess of Holstein, and eldest daughter of\r\nCatharine\xc2\xa0I. But she lived but a few months after her accession to the\r\nthrone, and the Princess Elizabeth succeeded her.\r\n\r\nThe Empress Elizabeth resembled her mother, the beautiful Catharine,\r\nbut was voluptuous and weak. She abandoned herself to puerile\r\namusements and degrading follies. And she was as superstitious as she\r\nwas debauched. She would continue whole hours on her knees before an\r\nimage, to which she spoke, and which she ever consulted; and then\r\nwould turn from bigotry to infamous sensuality. She hated\r\nFrederic\xc2\xa0II., and assisted Maria Theresa in her struggles. Russia\r\ngained no advantage from the Seven Years\' War, except that of\r\naccustoming the Russians to the tactics of modern warfare. She died in\r\n1762, and was succeeded by the Grand Duke Peter Fedorowitz, son of the\r\nDuke of Holstein and Anne, daughter of Peter\xc2\xa0I. He assumed the title\r\nof Peter\xc2\xa0III.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murder of Peter\xc2\xa0III.]\r\n\r\nPeter\xc2\xa0III. was a weak prince, but disposed to be beneficent. One of\r\nhis first acts was to recall the numerous exiles whom the jealousy of\r\nElizabeth had consigned to the deserts of Siberia. Among them was\r\nBiren, the haughty lover and barbarous minister of the Empress Anne\r\nand Marshal Munich, a veteran of eighty-two years of age. Peter also\r\nabolished the Inquisition, established by Alexis Michaelowitz, and\r\npromoted commerce, the arts, and sciences. He attempted to imitate the\r\nking of Prussia, for whom he had an extravagant admiration. He set at\r\nliberty the Prussian prisoners, and made peace with Frederic\xc2\xa0II. He\r\nhad a great respect for Germany, but despised the country over which\r\nhe was called to reign. But his partiality for the Germans, and his\r\nnumerous reforms, alienated the affections of his subjects, and he was\r\nnot sufficiently able to curb the spirit of discontent. He imitated\r\nhis immediate predecessors in the vices of drunkenness and sensuality,\r\nand was guilty of great imprudences. He reigned but a few months,\r\nbeing dethroned and murdered. His wife, the Empress Catharine, was the\r\nchief of the conspirators; and she was urged to the bloody act by her\r\nown desperate circumstances. She was obnoxious to her husband, who\r\nprobably would have destroyed her, had his life been prolonged. She,\r\nin view of his hostility, and prompted by an infernal ambition, sought\r\nto dethrone her husband. She was assisted by some of the most powerful\r\nnobles, and gained over most of the regiments of the imperial guard.\r\nThe Archbishop of Novgorod and the clergy were friendly to her,\r\nbecause they detested the reforms which Peter had attempted to make.\r\nCatharine became mistress of St. Petersburg, and caused herself to be\r\ncrowned Empress of Russia, in one of the principal churches. Peter had\r\ntimely notice of the revolt, but not the energy to suppress it. He\r\nlistened to the entreaties of women, rather than to the counsels of\r\nthose veteran generals who still supported his throne. He was timid,\r\nirresolute, and vacillating. He was doomed. He was a weak and\r\ninfatuated prince, and nothing could save him. He surrendered himself\r\ninto the hands of Catharine, abdicated his empire, and, shortly after,\r\ndied of poison. His wife seated herself, without further opposition,\r\non his throne; and the principal nobles of the empire, the army, and\r\nthe clergy, took the oath of allegiance, and the monarchs of Europe\r\nacknowledged her as the absolute sovereign of Russia. In 1763, she was\r\nfirmly established in the power which had been before wielded by\r\nCatharine\xc2\xa0I. She had dethroned an imbecile prince, whom she abhorred;\r\nbut the revolution was accomplished without bloodshed, and resulted in\r\nthe prosperity of Russia.\r\n\r\nCatharine was a woman of great moral defects; but she had many\r\nexcellences to counterbalance them; and her rule was, on the whole,\r\nable and beneficent. She was no sooner established in the power which\r\nshe had usurped, than she directed attention to the affairs of her\r\nempire, and sought to remedy the great evils which existed. She\r\ndevoted herself to business, advanced commerce and the arts, regulated\r\nthe finances, improved the jurisprudence of the realm, patronized all\r\nworks of internal improvement, rewarded eminent merit, encouraged\r\neducation, and exercised a liberal and enlightened policy in her\r\nintercourse with foreign powers. After engaging in business with her\r\nministers, she would converse with scholars and philosophers. With\r\nsome she studied politics, and with others literature. She tolerated\r\nall religions, abolished odious courts, and enacted mild laws. She\r\nheld out great inducements for foreigners to settle in Russia, and\r\nfounded colleges and hospitals in all parts of her empire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assassination of Ivan.]\r\n\r\nBeneficent as her reforms were, she nevertheless committed some great\r\npolitical crimes. One of these was the assassination of the dethroned\r\nIvan, the great-grandson of the Czar Ivan Alexejewitsch, who was\r\nbrother of Peter the Great. On the death of the Empress Anne, in 1731,\r\nhe had been proclaimed emperor: but when Elizabeth was placed upon the\r\nthrone, the infant was confined in the fortress of Schlussenburg. Here\r\nhe was so closely guarded and confined, that he was never allowed\r\naccess to the open air or the light of day. On the accession of\r\nCatharine, he was twenty-three years of age, and was extremely\r\nignorant and weak. But a conspiracy was formed to liberate him, and\r\nplace him on the throne. The attempt proved abortive, and the prince\r\nperished by the sword of his jailers, who were splendidly rewarded for\r\ntheir infamous services.\r\n\r\nHer scheme of foreign aggrandizement, and especially her interference\r\nin the affairs of Poland, caused the Ottoman Porte to declare war\r\nagainst her, which war proved disastrous to Turkey, and contributed to\r\naggrandize the empire of Russia. The Turks lost several battles on the\r\nPruth, Dniester, and Danube; the provinces of Wallachia, and Moldavia,\r\nand Bessarabia submitted to the Russian arms; while a great naval\r\nvictory, in the Mediterranean, was gained by Alexis Orloff, whose\r\nshare in the late revolution had raised him from the rank of a simple\r\nsoldier to that of a general of the empire, and a favorite of the\r\nempress. The naval defeat of the Turks at Tschesm\xc3\xa9, by Orloff and\r\nElphinstone, was one of the most signal of that age, and greatly\r\nweakened the power of Turkey. The war was not terminated until 1774,\r\nwhen the Turks were compelled to make peace, by the conditions of\r\nwhich, Russia obtained a large accession of territory, a great sum of\r\nmoney, the free navigation of the Black Sea, and a passage through the\r\nDardanelles.\r\n\r\nIn 1772 occurred the partition of Poland between Austria, Prussia, and\r\nRussia. Catharine and Frederic\xc2\xa0II. were the chief authors of this\r\ngreat political crime, which will be treated in the notice on Poland.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Catharine was not signalized by any other great political\r\nevents which affected materially the interests of Europe, except the\r\ncontinuation of the war with the Turks, which broke out again in 1778,\r\nand which was concluded in 1792, by the treaty of Jassy. In this war,\r\nPrince Potemkin, the favorite and prime minister of Catharine, greatly\r\ndistinguished himself; also General Suwarrow, afterwards noted for his\r\nPolish campaigns. In this war Russia lost two hundred thousand men,\r\nand the Turks three hundred and thirty thousand, besides expending two\r\nhundred and fifty millions of piasters. The most important political\r\nconsequence was the aggrandizement of Russia, whose dominion was\r\nestablished on the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Catharine.]\r\n\r\nCatharine, having acquired, either by arms or intrigues, almost half\r\nof Poland, the Crimea, and a part of the frontiers of Turkey, then\r\nturned her arms against Persia. But she died before she could realize\r\nher dreams of conquest. At her death, she was the most powerful\r\nsovereign that ever reigned in Russia. She was succeeded by her son,\r\nPaul\xc2\xa0I., (1796,) and her remains were deposited by the side of her\r\nmurdered husband, while his chief murderers, Alexis Orloff and Prince\r\nBaratinski, were ordered to stand at her funeral, on each side of his\r\ncoffin as chief mourners.\r\n\r\nCatharine, though a woman of great energy and talent, was ruled by\r\nfavorites; the most distinguished of whom were Gregory Orloff and\r\nPrince Potemkin. The former was a man of brutal manners and surprising\r\naudacity; the latter was more civilized, but was a man disgraced, like\r\nOrloff, by every vice. His memory, however, is still cherished in\r\nRussia on account of his military successes. He received more honors\r\nand rewards from his sovereign than is recorded of any favorite and\r\nminister of modern times. His power was equal to what Richelieu\r\nenjoyed, and his fortune was nearly as great as Mazarin\'s. He was\r\nknight of the principal orders of Prussia, Sweden, Poland, and Russia,\r\nfield-marshal, commander-in-chief of the Russian armies, high admiral\r\nof the fleets, great hetman of the Cossacks, and chamberlain of the\r\nempress. He received from her a fortune of fifty millions of roubles;\r\nequal to nearly twenty-five millions of dollars. The Orloffs received\r\nalso about seventeen millions in lands, and palaces, and money, with\r\nforty-five thousand peasants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her Character.]\r\n\r\nCatharine had two passions which never left her but with her last\r\nbreath--the love of the other sex, which degenerated into the most\r\nunbounded licentiousness, and the love of glory, which sunk into\r\nvanity. She expended ninety millions of roubles on her favorites, the\r\nnumber of which is almost incredible; and she was induced to engage in\r\nwars, which increased the burdens of her subjects.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of these two passions, her character is interesting\r\nand commanding. Her reign was splendid, and her court magnificent. Her\r\ninstitutions and monuments were to Russia what the magnificence of\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XIV. was to France. She was active and regular in her habits;\r\nwas never hurried away by anger, and was never a prey to dejection;\r\ncaprice and ill humor were never perceived in her conduct; she was\r\nhumorous, gay, and affable; she appreciated literature, and encouraged\r\ngood institutions; and, with all her faults, obtained the love and\r\nreverence of her subjects. She had not the virtues of Maria Theresa,\r\nbut had, perhaps, greater energy of character. Her foulest act was her\r\npart in the dismemberment of Poland, which now claims a notice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--For the reign of Maria Theresa, see Archdeacon\r\n     Coxe\'s Memoirs of the House of Austria, which is the most\r\n     interesting and complete.

Its ancient constitution has\r\nbeen completely subverted, and its extensive provinces are now annexed\r\nto the territories of Russia, Austria, and Prussia. The greatness of\r\nthe national calamities has excited the sympathy of Christian nations,\r\nand its unfortunate fate is generally lamented.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, Poland was a greater state than Russia, and\r\nwas the most powerful of the northern kingdoms of Europe. The Poles,\r\nas a nation, are not, however, of very ancient date. Prior to the\r\nninth century, they were split up into numerous tribes, independent of\r\neach other, and governed by their respective chieftains. Christianity\r\nwas introduced in the tenth century, and the earliest records of the\r\npeople were preserved by the monks. We know but little, with\r\ncertainty, until the time of Piast, who united the various states, and\r\nwhose descendants reigned until 1386, when the dynasty of the\r\nJagellons commenced, and continued till 1572. Under the princes of\r\nthis line, the government was arbitrary and oppressive. War was the\r\ngreat business and amusement of the princes, and success in it brought\r\nthe highest honors. The kings were, however, weak, cruel, and\r\ncapricious, ignorant, fierce, and indolent. The records of their\r\nreigns are the records of drunkenness, extortion, cruelty, lust, and\r\nviolence--the common history of all barbarous kings. There were some\r\nof the Polish princes who were benignant and merciful, but the great\r\nmajority of them, like the Merovingian and Carlovingian princes of the\r\nDark Ages, were unfit to reign, were the slaves of superstition, and\r\nthe tools of designing priests. There is a melancholy gloom hanging\r\nover the annals of the Middle Ages, especially in reference to kings.\r\nAnd yet their reigns, though stained by revolting crimes, generally\r\nwere to be preferred to the anarchy of an interregnum, or the\r\novergrown power of nobles.\r\n\r\nThe brightest period in the history of Poland was during the reigns of\r\nthe Jagellon princes, especially when Casimir\xc2\xa0I. held the sceptre of\r\nempire. During his reign, Lithuania, which then comprised Hungary,\r\nBohemia, and Silesia, was added to his kingdom. The university of\r\nCracow was founded, and Poland was the great resort of the Jews, to\r\nwhom were committed the trade and commerce of the land. But the rigors\r\nof the feudal system, and the vast preponderance of the aristocracy,\r\nproved unfortunate for the prosperity of the kingdom. What in England\r\nwas the foundation of constitutional liberty, proved in Poland to be\r\nsubversive of all order and good government. In England, the\r\nrepresentative of the nation was made an instrument in the hands of\r\nthe king of humbling the great nobility. Absolutism was established\r\nupon the ruins of feudalism. But, in Poland, the Diet of the nation\r\ncontrolled the king, and, as the representatives of the nobility\r\nalone, perpetuated the worst evils of the feudal system.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Crown of Poland Made Elective.]\r\n\r\nWhen Sigismund\xc2\xa0II., the last male heir of the house of Jagellon, died,\r\nin 1572, the nobles were sufficiently powerful to make the crown\r\nelective. From this period we date the decline of Poland. The\r\nReformation, so beneficent in its effects, did not spread to this\r\nSclavonic country; and the barbarism of the Middle Ages received no\r\ncheck. On the death of Sigismund, the nobles would not permit the new\r\nsovereign to be elected by the Diet, but only by the whole body of the\r\nnobility. The plain of Praga was the place selected for the election;\r\nand, at the time appointed, such a vast number of nobles arrived, that\r\nthe plain, of twelve miles in circumference, was scarcely large enough\r\nto contain them and their retinues. There never was such a sight seen\r\nsince the crusaders were marshalled on the field of Chalcedon, for all\r\nthe nobles were gorgeously apparelled, and decked with ermine, gold,\r\nand jewels. The Polish horseman frequently invests half his fortune in\r\nhis horse and dress. In the centre of the field was the tent of the\r\nlate king, capable of accommodating eight thousand men. The candidates\r\nfor the crown were Ernest Archduke of Austria; the Czar of Russia; a\r\nSwedish prince, and Henry of Valois, Duke of Anjou, and brother of\r\nCharles\xc2\xa0IX., king of France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Election of Henry, Duke of Anjou.]\r\n\r\nThe first candidate was rejected because the house of Austria was\r\nodious to the Polish nobles; the second, on account of his arrogance;\r\nand the third, because he was not powerful enough to bring advantage\r\nto the republic. The choice fell on the Duke of Anjou; and he, for the\r\ntitle of a king, agreed to the ignominious conditions which the Poles\r\nproposed, viz., that he should not attempt to influence the election\r\nof his successors, or assume the title of heir of the monarchy, or\r\ndeclare war without the consent of the Diet, or impose taxes of any\r\ndescription, or have power to appoint his ambassadors, or any\r\nforeigner to a benefice in the church; that he should convoke the Diet\r\nevery two years; and that he should not marry without its permission.\r\nHe also was required to furnish four thousand French troops, in case\r\nof war; to apply annually, for the sole benefit of the Polish state, a\r\nconsiderable part of his hereditary revenues; to pay the debts of the\r\ncrown; and to educate, at his own expense, at Paris or Cracow, one\r\nhundred Polish nobles. He had scarcely been crowned when his brother\r\ndied, and he was called to the throne of France. But he found it\r\ndifficult to escape from his kingdom, the government of which he found\r\nto be burdensome and vexatious. No criminal ever longed to escape from\r\na prison, more than this prince to break the fetters which bound him\r\nto his imperious subjects. He resolved to run away; concealed his\r\nintentions with great address; gave a great ball at his palace; and in\r\nthe midst of the festivities, set out with full speed towards Silesia.\r\nHe was pursued, but reached the territories of the emperor of Germany\r\nbefore he was overtaken. He reached Paris in safety, and was soon\r\nafter crowned as king of France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sobieski Assists the Emperor Leopold.]\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Stephen, Duke of Transylvania; and he, again, by\r\nSigismund, Prince of Sweden. The two sons of Sigismund, successively,\r\nwere elected kings of Poland, the last of whom, John\xc2\xa0II., was\r\nembroiled in constant war. It was during his disastrous reign that\r\nJohn Sobieski, with ten thousand Poles, defeated eighty thousand\r\nCossacks, the hereditary enemies of Poland. On the death of Michael,\r\nwho had succeeded John\xc2\xa0II., Sobieski was elected king, and he assumed\r\nthe title of _John III._ He was a native noble, and was chosen for his\r\nmilitary talents and successes. Indeed, Poland needed a strong arm to\r\ndefend her. Her decline had already commenced, and Sobieski himself\r\ncould not avert the ruin which impended. For some time, Poland enjoyed\r\ncessation from war, and the energies of the monarch were directed to\r\nrepair the evils which had disgraced his country. But before he could\r\nprosecute successfully any useful reforms, the war between the Turks\r\nand the eastern powers of Europe broke out, and Vienna was besieged by\r\nan overwhelming army of two hundred thousand Mohammedans. The city was\r\nbravely defended, but its capture seemed inevitable. The emperor of\r\nGermany, Leopold, in his despair, implored the aid of Sobieski. He was\r\ninvested with the command of the allied armies of Austrians,\r\nBavarians, Saxons, and Poles, amounting to seventy thousand men. With\r\nthis force he advanced to relieve Vienna. He did not hesitate to\r\nattack the vast forces encamped beneath the walls of the Austrian\r\ncapital, and obtained one of the most signal victories in the history\r\nof war. Immense treasures fell into his hands, and Vienna and\r\nChristendom were saved.\r\n\r\nBut the mean-spirited emperor treated his deliverer with arrogance and\r\nchilling coldness. No gratitude was exhibited or felt. But the pope\r\nsent him the rarest of his gifts--"the dove of pearls." Sobieski, in\r\nspite of the ingratitude of Leopold, pursued his victories over the\r\nTurks; and, like Charles Martel, ten centuries before, freed Europe\r\nfrom the danger of a Mohammedan yoke. But he saved a serpent, when\r\nabout to be crushed, which turned and stung him for his kindness. The\r\ndismemberment of his country soon followed the deliverance of Vienna.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded, in 1696, by Frederic Augustus, Elector of Saxony,\r\nwhose reign was a constant succession of disasters. During his reign,\r\nPoland was invaded and conquered by Charles\xc2\xa0XII. of Sweden. He was\r\nsucceeded by his son, Frederic Augustus\xc2\xa0II., the most beautiful,\r\nextravagant, luxurious, and licentious monarch of his age. But he was\r\na man of elegant tastes, and he filled Dresden with pictures and works\r\nof art, which are still the admiration of travellers. His reign, as\r\nking of Poland, was exceedingly disastrous. Muscovite and Prussian\r\narmies traversed the plains of Poland at pleasure, and extorted\r\nwhatever they pleased. Faction was opposed by faction in the field and\r\nin the Diet. The national assembly was dissolved by the _veto_, the\r\nlaws were disregarded, and brute force prevailed on every side. The\r\nmiserable peasants in vain besought the protection of their brutal yet\r\npowerless lords. Bands of robbers infested the roads, and hunger\r\ninvaded the cottages. The country rapidly declined in wealth,\r\npopulation, and public spirit.\r\n\r\nUnder the reign of Stanislaus\xc2\xa0II., who succeeded Frederic\r\nAugustus\xc2\xa0II., in 1764, the ambassadors of Prussia, Austria, and\r\nRussia, informed the miserable king that, in order to prevent further\r\nbloodshed, and restore peace to Poland, the three powers had\r\ndetermined to insist upon their claims to some of the provinces of the\r\nkingdom. This barefaced and iniquitous scheme for the dismemberment of\r\nPoland originated with Frederic the Great. So soon as the close of the\r\nSeven Years\' War allowed him repose, he turned his eyes to Poland,\r\nwith a view of seizing one of her richest provinces. Territories\r\ninhabited by four million eight hundred thousand people, were divided\r\nbetween Frederic, Maria Theresa, and Catharine\xc2\xa0II. There were no\r\nscruples of conscience in the breast of Frederic, or of Catharine, a\r\nwoman of masculine energy, but disgraceful morals. The conscience of\r\nMaria Theresa, however, long resisted. "The fear of hell," said she,\r\n"restrains me from seizing another\'s possessions;" but sophistry was\r\nbrought to bear upon her mind, and the lust of dominion asserted its\r\npowerful sway. This crime was regarded with detestation by the other\r\npowers of Europe; but they were too much occupied with their own\r\ntroubles to interfere, except by expostulation. England was disturbed\r\nby difficulties in the colonies, and France was distracted by\r\nrevolutionary tumults.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Liberum Veto.]\r\n\r\nStanislaus, robbed of one third of his dominions, now directed his\r\nattention to those reforms which had been so long imperatively needed.\r\nHe intrusted to the celebrated Zamoyski the task of revising the\r\nconstitution. The patriotic chancellor recommended the abolition of\r\nthe "liberum veto," a fatal privilege, by which any one of the armed\r\nequestrians, who assembled on the plain of Praga to elect a king, or\r\ndeliberate on state affairs, had power to nullify the most important\r\nacts, and even to dissolve the assembly. A single word, pronounced in\r\nthe vehemence of domestic strife, or by the influence of external\r\ncorruption, could plunge the nation into a lethargic sleep. And\r\nfaction went so far as often to lead to the dissolution of the\r\nassembly. The treasury, the army, the civil authority then fell into a\r\nstate of anarchy. Zamoyski also recommended the emancipation of serfs,\r\nthe encouragement of commerce, the elevation of the trading classes,\r\nand the abolition of the fatal custom of electing a king. But the\r\nPolish nobles, infatuated and doomed, opposed these wholesome reforms.\r\nThey even had the madness to invoke the aid of the Empress Catharine\r\nto protect them in their ancient privileges. She sent an army into\r\nPoland, and great disturbances resulted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fall of Poland.]\r\n\r\nToo late, at last, the nobles perceived their folly, and adopted some\r\nof the proposed reforms. But these reforms gave a new pretence to the\r\nallied powers for a second dismemberment. An army of one hundred\r\nthousand men invaded Poland, to effect a new partition. The unhappy\r\ncountry, without fortified towns or mountains, abandoned by all the\r\nworld, distracted by divisions, and destitute of fortresses and\r\nmilitary stores, was crushed by the power of gigantic enemies. There\r\nwere patriotism and bravery left, but no union or organized strength.\r\nThe patriots made a desperate struggle under Kosciusko, a Lithuanian\r\nnoble, but were forced to yield to inevitable necessity. Warsaw for a\r\ntime held out against fifty thousand men; but the Polish hero was\r\ndefeated in a decisive engagement, and unfortunately taken prisoner.\r\nHis countrymen still rallied, and another bloody battle was fought at\r\nPraga, opposite Warsaw, on the other side of the Vistula, and ten\r\nthousand were slain; Praga was reduced to a heap of ruins; and twelve\r\nthousand citizens were slaughtered in cold blood. Warsaw soon after\r\nsurrendered, Stanislaus was sent as a captive to Russia, and the final\r\npartition of the kingdom was made.\r\n\r\n"Sarmatia fell," but not "unwept," or "without a crime." "She fell,"\r\nsays Alison, "a victim of her own dissensions, of the chimera of\r\nequality falsely pursued, and the rigor of aristocracy unceasingly\r\nmaintained. The eldest born of the European family was the first to\r\nperish, because she had thwarted all the ends of the social union;\r\nbecause she united the turbulence of democratic to the exclusion of\r\naristocratic societies; because she had the vacillation of a republic\r\nwithout its energy, and the oppression of a monarchy without its\r\nstability. The Poles obstinately refused to march with other nations\r\nin the only road to civilization; they had valor, but it could not\r\nenforce obedience to the laws; it could not preserve domestic\r\ntranquillity; it could not restrain the violence of petty feuds and\r\nintestine commotions; it could not preserve the proud nobles from\r\nunbounded dissipation and corruption; it could not prevent foreign\r\npowers from interfering in the affairs of the kingdom; it could not\r\ndissolve the union of these powers with discontented parties at home;\r\nit could not inspire the slowly-moving machine of government with\r\nvigor, when the humblest partisan, corrupted with foreign money, could\r\narrest it with a word; it could not avert the entrance of foreign\r\narmies to support the factious and rebellious; it could not uphold, in\r\na divided country, the national independence against the combined\r\neffects of foreign and domestic treason; finally, it could not effect\r\nimpossibilities, nor turn aside the destroying sword which had so long\r\nimpended over it."\r\n\r\nBut this great crime was attended with retribution. Prussia, in her\r\nefforts to destroy Poland, paralyzed her armies on the Rhine. Suwarrow\r\nentered Warsaw when its spires were reddened by the fires of Praga;\r\nbut the sack of the fallen capital was forgotten in the conflagration\r\nof Moscow. The remains of the soldiers of Kosciusko sought a refuge in\r\nrepublican France, and served with distinction, in the armies of\r\nNapoleon, against the powers that had dismembered their country.\r\n\r\nThe ruin of Poland, as an independent state, was not fully\r\naccomplished until the year 1832, when it was incorporated into the\r\ngreat empire of Russia. But the history of the late revolution, with\r\nall its melancholy results, cannot be well presented in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Fletcher\'s History of Poland.

Nothing, in the history of society, is more marvellous than the\r\nrise of Mohammedan kingdoms. The victories of the Saracens and Turks\r\nwere rapid and complete; and in the tenth century, they were the most\r\nsuccessful warriors on the globe, and threatened to subvert the world.\r\nThey had planted the standard of the Prophet on the walls of Eastern\r\ncapitals, and had extended their conquests to India on the east, and\r\nto Spain on the west. Powerful Mohammedan states had arisen in Asia,\r\nAfrica, and Europe, and the Crusaders alone arrested the progress of\r\nthese triumphant armies. The enthusiasm which the doctrines of\r\nMohammed had kindled, cannot easily be explained; but it was fresh,\r\nimpetuous, and self-sacrificing. Successive armies of Mohammedan\r\ninvaders overwhelmed the ancient realms of civilization, and reduced\r\nthe people whom they conquered and converted to a despotic yoke. But\r\nsuccess enervated the victorious conquerors of the East, the empire of\r\nthe Caliphs was broken up, and great changes took place even in those\r\nlands where the doctrines of the Koran prevailed. Mohammed perpetuated\r\na religion, but not an empire. Different Saracenic chieftains revolted\r\nfrom the "Father of the Faithful," and established separate kingdoms,\r\nor viceroyalties, nearly independent of the acknowledged successors of\r\nMohammed. The Saracenic empire was early dismembered, and the sultans\r\nof Egypt, Spain, and Syria contested for pre\xc3\xabminence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of the Turks.]\r\n\r\nBut a new power arose on the ruins of the Saracen empire, and became\r\nthe enthusiastic defenders of the religion of Islam. The Turks were an\r\nobscure tribe of barbarians when Bagdad was the seat of a powerful\r\nmonarchy. Their origin has been traced to the wilds of Scythia; but\r\nthey early deserted their native forests in search of more fruitful\r\nregions. When Apulia and Sicily were subdued by the Norman pirates, a\r\nswarm of these Scythian shepherds settled in Armenia, probably in the\r\nninth century, and, by their valor and simplicity, soon became a\r\npowerful tribe. Not long after they were settled in their new abode,\r\nthe Sultan of Persia invoked their aid to assist him in his wars\r\nagainst the Caliph of Bagdad, his great rival. The Turks complied with\r\nhis request, and their arms were successful. The sultan then refused\r\nto part with such useful auxiliaries, and moreover, fearing their\r\nstrength, designed to employ them in his wars against the Hindoos, and\r\nto shut them up in the centre of his dominions. The Turkmans rebelled,\r\nwithdrew into a mountainous part of the country, became robbers, and\r\ndevastated the adjacent countries. The band of robbers gradually\r\nswelled into a powerful army, gained a great victory over the troops\r\nof the Sultan Mohammed, and placed their chieftain upon the Persian\r\nthrone, (1038.) According to Gibbon, the new monarch was chosen by\r\nlot, and Seljuk had the fortune to win the prize of conquest, and\r\nbecame the founder of the dynasty of the Shepherd kings. During the\r\nreign of his grandson Togrul, the ancient Persian princes were\r\nexpelled, and the Turks embraced the religion of the conquered. In\r\n1055, the Turkish sultan delivered the Caliph of Bagdad from the arms\r\nof the Caliph of Egypt, who disputed with him the title of _Commander\r\nof the Faithful_. For this service he was magnificently rewarded by\r\nthe grateful successor of the Prophet, who, at that time, banqueted in\r\nhis palace at Bagdad--a venerable phantom of power. The victorious\r\nsultan was publicly commissioned as lieutenant of the caliph, and he\r\nwas virtually seated on the throne of the Abbassides. Shortly after,\r\nthe Turkish conqueror invaded the falling empire of the Greeks, and\r\nits Asiatic provinces were irretrievably lost. In the latter part of\r\nthe eleventh century, the Turkish power was established in Asia Minor,\r\nand Jerusalem itself had fallen into the hands of the sultan. He\r\nexacted two pieces of gold from the Christian pilgrim, and treated\r\nhim, moreover, with greater cruelty than the Saracens had ever\r\nexercised. The extortion and oppression of the Turkish masters of the\r\nSacred City led to the Crusades and the final possession of Western\r\nAsia by the followers of the Prophet. The Turkish power constantly\r\nincreased with the decline of the Saracenic and Greek empires, but the\r\nSeljukian dynasty, like that of Abbassides at Bagdad, at last run out,\r\nand Othman, a soldier of fortune, became sultan of the Turks. He is\r\nregarded as the founder of the Ottoman empire, and under his reign,\r\nfrom 1299 to 1326, the Moslems made rapid strides in the progress of\r\naggrandizement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turkish Conquerors.]\r\n\r\nOrkham, his son, instituted the force of the Janizaries, completed the\r\nconquest of Bithynia, and laid the foundation of Turkish power in\r\nEurope. Under his successor, Amurath\xc2\xa0I., Adrianople became the capital\r\nof the Ottoman empire, and the rival of Constantinople. Bajazet\r\nsucceeded Amurath, and his conquests extended from the Euphrates to\r\nthe Danube. In 1396, he defeated, at Nicopolis, a confederate army of\r\none hundred thousand Christians; and, in the intoxication of victory,\r\ndeclared that he would feed his horse with a bushel of oats on the\r\naltar of St. Peter, at Rome. Had it not been for the victories of\r\nTamerlane, Constantinople, which contained within its walls the feeble\r\nfragments of a great empire, would also have fallen into his hands. He\r\nwas unsuccessful in his war with the great conqueror of Asia, and was\r\ndefeated at the battle of Angora, (1402,) and taken captive, and\r\ncarried to Samarcand, by Tamerlane, in an iron cage.\r\n\r\nThe great Bajazet died in captivity, and Mohammed\xc2\xa0I. succeeded to his\r\nthrone. He restored, on a firmer basis, the fabric of the Ottoman\r\nmonarchy, and devoted himself to the arts of peace. His successor,\r\nAmurath\xc2\xa0II., continued hostilities with the Greeks, and laid siege to\r\nConstantinople. But this magnificent city, the last monument of Roman\r\ngreatness, resisted the Turkish arms only for a while. In 1453, it\r\nfell before an irresistible force of three hundred thousand men,\r\nsupported by a fleet of three hundred sail. The Emperor Constantine\r\nsucceeded in maintaining a siege of fifty-three days; and the religion\r\nand empire of the Christians were trodden to the dust by the Moslem\r\nconquerors. The city was sacked, the people were enslaved, and the\r\nChurch of St. Sophia was despoiled of the oblations of ages, and\r\nconverted into a Mohammedan mosque. One hundred and twenty thousand\r\nmanuscripts perished in the sack of Constantinople, and the palaces\r\nand treasure of the Greeks were transferred to semi-barbarians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Progress of the Turks.]\r\n\r\nFrom that time, the Byzantine capital became the seat of the Ottoman\r\nempire; and, for more than two centuries, Turkish armies excited the\r\nfears and disturbed the peace of the world. They gradually subdued and\r\nannexed Macedonia, the Peloponnesus, Epirus, Bulgaria, Servia, Bosnia,\r\nArmenia, Cyprus, Syria, Egypt, India, Tunis, Algiers, Media,\r\nMesopotamia, and a part of Hungary, to the dominions of the sultan. In\r\nthe sixteenth century, the Ottoman empire was the most powerful in the\r\nworld. Nor should we be surprised, in view of the great success of the\r\nTurks, when we remember their singular bravery, their absorbing\r\nambition, their almost incredible obedience to the commands of the\r\nsultan, and the unity which pervaded the national councils. They also\r\nfought to extend their religion, to which they were blind devotees.\r\nAfter the capture of Constantinople, a succession of great princes sat\r\non the most absolute throne known in modern times; men disgraced by\r\nmany crimes, but still singularly adapted to extend their dominion.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the Turks justly alarmed the Emperor Charles\xc2\xa0V., and\r\nhe exerted all his energies to unite the German princes against them,\r\nbut unsuccessfully. The Sultan Solyman, called the _Magnificent_,\r\nmaintained his supremacy over Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia,\r\nravaged Hungary, wrested Rhodes from the Knights of St. John,\r\nconquered the whole of Arabia, and attacked the Portuguese dominion in\r\nIndia. He raised the Turkish empire to the highest pitch of its\r\ngreatness, and died while besieging Sigeth, as he was completing the\r\nconquest of Hungary. His empire was one vast camp, and his decrees\r\nwere dated from the imperial stirrup. The iron sceptre which he and\r\nhis successors wielded was imbrued in blood; and discipline alone was\r\nthe politics of his soldiers, and rapine their resources.\r\n\r\nSelim\xc2\xa0II. succeeded Solyman, and set the ruinous example of not going\r\nhimself to the wars, and of carrying them on by his lieutenants. His\r\nson, Murad\xc2\xa0III., penetrated into Russia and Poland, and made war on\r\nthe Emperor of Germany. Mohammed\xc2\xa0III., who died in 1604, murdered all\r\nhis brothers, nineteen in number, and executed his own son. It was\r\nusual, when an emperor mounted the throne, for him to put to death his\r\nbrothers and nephews. Indeed, the characters of the sultans were\r\nmarked by unusual ferocity and jealousy, and they were unscrupulous in\r\nthe means they took to advance their power. The world has never seen\r\nmore suspicious tyrants; and it ever must excite our wonder that they\r\nwere so unhesitatingly obeyed. But they were, however, sometimes\r\ndethroned by the Janizaries, who constituted a sort of imperial guard.\r\nOsman\xc2\xa0II., fearing their power, and disgusted with their degeneracy,\r\nresolved to destroy them, as dangerous to the state. But his design\r\nwas discovered, and he himself lost his life, (1622.) Several monsters\r\nof tyranny and iniquity succeeded him, whose reigns were disgraced by\r\nevery excess of debauchery and cruelty. Their subjects, however, had\r\nnot, as yet, lost vigor, temperance, and ambition, and still continued\r\nto furnish troops unexampled for discipline and bravery, and bent on\r\nconquest and dominion.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish power received no great checks until the reign of\r\nMohammed\xc2\xa0IV., during which Sobieski defeated an immense army, which\r\nhad laid siege to Vienna. By the peace of Carlovitz, in 1699,\r\nTransylvania was ceded to the Emperor of Germany, and a barrier was\r\nraised against Mohammedan invasion.\r\n\r\nThe Russians, from the time of Peter the Great, looked with great\r\njealousy on the power of the sultan, and several wars were the result.\r\nNo Russian sovereign desired the humiliation of the Porte more than\r\nCatharine\xc2\xa0II. A bloody contest ensued, signalized by the victories of\r\nGalitzin, Suwarrow, Romanzoff, and Orloff, by which Turkey became a\r\nsecond class power, no longer feared by the European states.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of Turkish Power.]\r\n\r\nFrom the peace of Carlovitz, the decline of the Ottoman empire has\r\nbeen gradual, but marked, owing to the indifference of the Turks to\r\nall modern improvements, and a sluggish, conservative policy, hostile\r\nto progress, and sceptical of civilization. The Turks have ever been\r\nbigoted Mohammedans, and hostile to European influences. The Oriental\r\ndress has been preserved in Constantinople, and all the manners and\r\ncustoms of the people are similar to what they were in Asia several\r\ncenturies ago.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turkish Institutions.]\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiarities of the Turkish government, in the most\r\nflourishing period of its history, was the institution of the\r\nJanizaries--a guard of soldiers, to whom was intrusted the\r\nguardianship of the sultan, and the protection of his capital. When\r\nwarlike and able princes were seated on the throne, this institution\r\nproved a great support to the government; but when the reins were held\r\nby effeminate princes, the Janizaries, like the Pr\xc3\xa6torian Guards of\r\nRome, acquired an undue ascendency, and even deposed the monarchs whom\r\nthey were bound to obey. They were insolent, extortionate, and\r\nextravagant, and became a great burden to the state. At first they\r\nwere brave and resolute; but they gradually lost their skill and their\r\ncourage, were uniformly beaten in the later wars with the Russians,\r\nand retained nothing of the soldier but the name. Mahmoud\xc2\xa0II., in our\r\nown time, succeeded in dissolving this dangerous body, and in\r\nintroducing European tactics into his army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turkish Character.]\r\n\r\nThe Turkish institutions have reference chiefly to the military\r\ncharacter of the nation. All Mussulmans, in the eye of the law, are\r\nsoldiers, to whom the extension of the empire and the propagation of\r\ntheir faith were the avowed objects of warfare. They may be regarded,\r\nwherever they have conquered, as military colonists, exercising great\r\ntyranny, and treating all vanquished subjects with contempt. The\r\ngovernment has ever been a pure despotism, and both the executive and\r\nlegislative authorities have been vested in the sultan. He is the sole\r\nfountain of honor; for, in Turkey, birth confers no privilege. His\r\nactions are regarded as prescribed by an inevitable fate, and his\r\nsubjects suffer with resignation. The evils of despotism are\r\naggravated by the ignorance and effeminacy of those to whom power is\r\nintrusted, although the grand vizier, who is the prime minister of the\r\nempire, is generally a man of great experience and talent. All the\r\nlaws of the country are founded upon the precepts of the Koran, the\r\nexample of Mohammed, the precepts of the four first caliphs, and the\r\ndecision of learned doctors upon disputed cases. Justice is\r\nadministered promptly, but without much regard to equity or mercy; and\r\nthe course of the grand vizier is generally marked with blood. The\r\ncharacter of the people partakes of the nature of their government,\r\nreligion, and climate. They are arrogant, ignorant, and austere;\r\npassing from devotion to obscenity; fastidiously abstemious in some\r\nthings, and grossly sensual in others. They have cherished the virtues\r\nof hospitality, and are fond of conversation but their domestic life\r\nis spent in voluptuous idleness, and is dull and insipid compared with\r\nthat of Europeans. But the Turks have degenerated. In the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries, they were simple, brave, and religious. They\r\nfounded an immense empire on the ruins of Asiatic monarchies, and\r\nfilled the world with the terror of their arms. For two hundred years\r\ntheir power has been retrograding, and there is much reason now to\r\nbelieve that a total eclipse of their glory is soon to take place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--See Knolle\'s History of Turkey.

TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF WILLIAM PITT.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat subjects were discussed in England, and great events happened in\r\nAmerica, during the latter years of the reigns of Frederic\xc2\xa0II.,\r\nCatharine\xc2\xa0II., and Maria Theresa. These now demand attention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military Successes in America.]\r\n\r\nGeorge\xc2\xa0III. ascended the throne of Great Britain at a period of\r\nunparalleled prosperity, when the English arms were victorious in all\r\nparts of the world, and when commerce and the arts had greatly\r\nenriched his country and strengthened its political importance. By the\r\npeace of Paris, (1763,) the dominions of George\xc2\xa0III. were enlarged,\r\nand the country over which he reigned was the most powerful in Europe.\r\n\r\nMr. George Grenville succeeded the Earl of Bute as the prime minister\r\nof the king, and he was chiefly assisted by the Earls of Egremont and\r\nHalifax. His administration was signalized by the prosecution of\r\nWilkes, and by schemes for the taxation of the American colonies.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkes was a member of parliament, but a man of ruined fortunes\r\nand profligate morals. As his circumstances were desperate, he applied\r\nto the ministry for some post of emolument; but his application was\r\nrejected. Failure enraged him, and he swore revenge, and resolved to\r\nlibel the ministers, under the pretext of exercising the liberty of\r\nthe press. He was editor of the North Briton, a periodical publication\r\nof some talent, but more bitterness. In the forty-fifth number, he\r\nassailed the king, charging him with a direct falsehood. The charge\r\nshould have been dismissed with contempt; for it was against the\r\ndignity of the government to refute an infamous slander. But, in an\r\nevil hour, it was thought expedient to vindicate the honor of the\r\nsovereign; and a warrant was therefore issued against the editor,\r\npublisher, and printer of the publication. The officers of the law\r\nentered Wilkes\'s house late one evening, seized his papers, and\r\ncommitted him to the Tower. He sued out a writ of habeas corpus, in\r\nconsequence of which he was brought up to Westminster Hall. Being a\r\nmember of parliament, and a man of considerable abilities and\r\ninfluence, his case attracted attention. The judges decided that his\r\narrest was illegal, since a member of parliament could not be\r\nimprisoned except for treason, felony, or breach of the peace. He had\r\nnot committed any of these crimes, for a libel had only a _tendency_\r\nto disturb the peace. Still, had he been a private person, his\r\nimprisonment would have been legal; but being unconstitutional, he was\r\ndischarged. Lord Chief Justice Pratt gained great popularity by his\r\ncharge in favor of the liberation of Wilkes, and ever nobly defended\r\nconstitutional liberty. He is better known as Lord Camden, the able\r\nlord chancellor and statesman during a succeeding administration, and\r\none of the greatest lawyers England has produced, ranking with Lord\r\nHardwicke, Lord Ellenborough, and Lord Eldon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prosecution of Wilkes.]\r\n\r\nAfter the discharge of Wilkes, the attorney-general was then ordered\r\nto commence a state prosecution, and he was arraigned at the bar of\r\nthe House of Commons. It was voted, by a great majority, that the\r\nforty-fifth number of the North Briton was a scandalous and seditious\r\nlibel, and tending to excite traitorous insurrections. It was further\r\nvoted that the paper should be burned by the common hangman. Wilkes\r\nthen complained to the House of a breach of privilege, which\r\ncomplaint, being regular, was considered. But the Commons decided that\r\nthe privilege of parliament does not extend to a libel, which\r\nresolution was against the decision of the Court of Common Pleas, and\r\nthe precedents upon record in their own journals. However scandalous\r\nand vulgar the vituperation of Wilkes, and especially disgraceful in a\r\nmember of parliament, still his prosecution was an attack on the\r\nconstitution. Wilkes was arrested on what is called a _general\r\nwarrant_, which, if often resorted to, would be fatal to the liberties\r\nof the people. Many, who strongly disliked the libeller, still\r\ndefended him in this instance, among whom were Pitt, Beckford, Legge,\r\nYorke, and Sir George Saville. But party spirit and detestation of\r\nWilkes triumphed over the constitution, and the liberties of members\r\nof parliament were abridged even by themselves. But Wilkes was not\r\ndiscouraged, and immediately brought an action, in Westminster Hall,\r\nagainst the Earl of Halifax, the secretary of state, for seizing his\r\npapers, and, after a hearing of fifteen hours, before Lord Chief\r\nJustice Pratt and a special jury, obtained a verdict in his favor of\r\none thousand pounds damages and costs.\r\n\r\nWhile the Commons were prosecuting Wilkes for a libel, the Lords also\r\ncontinued the prosecution. Wilkes, in conjunction with Potter, a\r\ndissipated son of Archbishop Potter, during some of their bacchanalian\r\nrevels, had written a blasphemous and obscene poem, after the model of\r\nPope\'s Essay on Man, called _An Essay on Woman_. The satire was not\r\npublished, but a few copies of it were printed privately for the\r\nauthors. Lord Sandwich had contrived to secure a copy of it, and read\r\nit before the House; and the Lords, indignant and disgusted, voted an\r\naddress to the king to institute a prosecution against the author. The\r\nLords, by so doing, departed from the dignity of their order, and\r\ntheir ordinary functions, and their persecution served to strengthen,\r\ninstead of weaken, the cause of Wilkes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Churchill.]\r\n\r\nAssociated with him, in his writings and his revels, was the poet\r\nChurchill, a clergyman of the Establishment, but as open a contemner\r\nof decency as Wilkes himself. For some years, his poetry had proved as\r\nbad as his sermons, his time being spent in low dissipation. An\r\nill-natured criticism on his writings called forth his energies, and\r\nhe started, all at once, a giant in numbers, with all the fire of\r\nDryden and all the harmony of Pope. Imagination, wit, strength, and\r\nsense, were crowded into his compositions; but he was careless of both\r\nmatter and manner, and wrote just what came in his way. "This\r\nbacchanalian priest," says Horace Walpole, "now mouthing patriotism,\r\nand now venting libertinism, the scourge of bad men, and scarce better\r\nthan the worst, debauching wives, and protecting his gown by the\r\nweight of his fist, engaged with Wilkes in his war on the Scots, and\r\nset himself up as the Hercules that was to cleanse the state and\r\npunish its oppressors. And true it is, the storm that saved us was\r\nraised in taverns and night-cellars; so much more effectual were the\r\norgies of Churchill and Wilkes than the dagger of Cato and Brutus.\r\nEarl Temple joined them in mischief and dissipation, and whispered\r\nwhere they might find torches, though he took care never to be seen to\r\nlight one himself. This triumvirate has even made me reflect that\r\nnations are most commonly saved by the worst men in them. The virtuous\r\nare too scrupulous to go the lengths which are necessary to rouse the\r\npeople against their tyrants."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grafton\'s Administration.]\r\n\r\nThe ferment created by the prosecution of Wilkes led to the\r\nresignation of Mr. Grenville, in 1765, and the Marquis of Rockingham\r\nsucceeded him as head of the administration. He continued, however,\r\nthe prosecution. He retained his place but a few months, and was\r\nsucceeded by the Duke of Grafton, the object of such virulent\r\ninvective in the Letters of Junius, a work without elevation of\r\nsentiment, without any appeal to generous principle, without\r\nrecognition of the eternal laws of justice, and without truthfulness,\r\nand yet a work which produced a great sensation, and is to this day\r\nregarded as a masterpiece of savage and unscrupulous sarcasm. The Duke\r\nof Grafton had the same views as his predecessor respecting Wilkes,\r\nwho had the audacity, notwithstanding the sentence of outlawry which\r\nhad been passed against him, to return from Paris, to which he had,\r\nfor a time, retired, and to appear publicly at Guildhall, and offer\r\nhimself as a candidate for the city of London. He was contemptuously\r\nrejected, but succeeded in being elected as member for Middlesex\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkes, however, recognizing the outlawry that had been passed\r\nagainst him, surrendered himself to the jurisdiction of the Court of\r\nthe King\'s Bench, which was then presided over by Lord Mansfield. This\r\ngreat lawyer and jurist confirmed the verdicts against him, and\r\nsentenced him to pay a fine of one thousand pounds, to suffer two\r\nyears\' imprisonment, and to find security for good behavior for seven\r\nyears. This sentence was odious and severe, and the more unjustifiable\r\nin view of the arbitrary and unprecedented alteration of the records\r\non the very night preceding the trial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popularity of Wilkes.]\r\n\r\nThe multitude, enraged, rescued their idol from the officers of the\r\nlaw, as they were conducting him to prison, and carried him with\r\ntriumph through the city; but, through his entreaties, they were\r\nprevailed upon to abstain from further acts of outrage. Mr. Wilkes\r\nagain surrendered himself, and was confined in prison. When the\r\nCommons met, Wilkes was again expelled, in order to satisfy the\r\nvengeance of the court. But the electors of Middlesex again returned\r\nhim to parliament, and the Commons voted that, being once expelled, he\r\nwas incapable of sitting, even if elected, in the same parliament. The\r\nelectors of Middlesex, equally determined with the Commons, chose him,\r\nfor a third time, their representative; and the election, for the\r\nthird time, was declared void by the commons. In order to terminate\r\nthe contest, Colonel Lutterell, a member of the House, vacated his\r\nseat, and offered himself a candidate for Middlesex. He received two\r\nhundred and ninety-six votes, and Wilkes twelve hundred and\r\nforty-three, but Lutterell was declared duly elected by the Commons,\r\nand took his seat for Middlesex.\r\n\r\nThis decision threw the whole nation into a ferment, and was plainly\r\nan outrage on the freedom of elections; and it was so considered by\r\nsome of the most eminent men in England, even by those who despised\r\nthe character of Wilkes. Lord Chatham, from his seat, declared "that\r\nthe laws were despised, trampled upon, destroyed; those laws which had\r\nbeen made by the stern virtues of our ancestors, those iron barons of\r\nold, to whose spirit in the hour of contest, and to whose fortitude in\r\nthe triumph of victory, the silken barons of this day owe all their\r\nhonors and security."\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkes subsequently triumphed; the Commons grew weary of a contest\r\nwhich brought no advantage and much ignominy, and the prosecution was\r\ndropped; but not until the subject of it had been made Lord Mayor of\r\nLondon. From 1768 to 1772, he was the sole unrivalled political idol\r\nof the people, who lavished on him all in their power to bestow. They\r\nsubscribed twenty thousand pounds for the payment of his debts,\r\nbesides gifts of plate, wine, and household goods. Every wall bore his\r\nname and every window his picture. In china, bronze, or marble, he\r\nstood upon the chimney-pieces of half the houses in London, and he\r\nswung from the sign-board of every village, and every great road in\r\nthe environs of the metropolis. In 1770 he was discharged from his\r\nimprisonment, in 1771 was permitted to take his seat, and elected\r\nmayor. From 1776, his popularity declined, and he became involved in\r\npecuniary difficulties. He, however, emerged from them, and enjoyed a\r\nquiet office until his death (1797.) He was a patriot from accident,\r\nand not from principle, and corrupt in his morals; but he was a\r\ngentleman of elegant manners and cultivated taste. He was the most\r\npopular political character ever known in England; and his name, at\r\none time, was sufficient to blow up the flames of sedition, and excite\r\nthe lower orders to acts of violence bordering on madness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Taxation of the Colonies.]\r\n\r\nDuring his prosecution, important events occurred, of greater moment\r\nto the world. The disputes about the taxation of America led to the\r\nestablishment of a new republic, whose extent and grandeur have never\r\nbeen equalled, and whose future greatness cannot well be exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThese disputes commenced during the administration of George\r\nGrenville. The proposal to tax the American colonies had been before\r\nproposed to Sir Robert Walpole, but this prudent and sagacious\r\nminister dared not run the risk. Mr. Grenville was not, however,\r\ndaunted by the difficulties and dangers which the more able Walpole\r\nregarded. In order to lighten the burden which resulted from the\r\nruinous wars of Pitt, the minister proposed to raise a revenue from\r\nthe colonies. The project pleased the house, and the Stamp Duties were\r\nimposed. It is true that the tax was a light one, and was so regarded\r\nby Mr. Grenville; but he intended it as a precedent; he was resolved\r\nto raise a revenue from the colonies sufficiently great to lighten the\r\npublic burden. He regarded the colonists as subjects of the King of\r\nGreat Britain, in every sense of the word; and, since they received\r\nprotection from the government, they were bound to contribute to its\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indignation of the Colonies.]\r\n\r\nBut the colonists, now scattered along the coast from Maine to\r\nGeorgia, took other views. They maintained that, though subject in\r\nsome degree to English legislation, they could not be taxed, any more\r\nthan other subjects of Great Britain, without their consent. They were\r\nwilling to be ruled in accordance with those royal charters which had,\r\nat different times, been given them. They were even willing to assist\r\nthe mother country, which they loved and revered, and with which were\r\nconnected their brightest and most cherished associations, in\r\nexpelling its enemies from adjoining territories, and to fight battles\r\nin its defence. They were willing to receive the literature, the\r\nreligion, the fashions, and the opinions of their brethren in England.\r\nBut they looked upon the soil which they cultivated in the wilderness\r\nwith so many difficulties, hardships, and dangers, as their own, and\r\nbelieved that they were bound to raise taxes only to defend the soil,\r\nand promote good government, religion, and morality in their midst.\r\nBut they could not understand why they were bound to pay taxes to\r\nsupport English wars on the continent of Europe. It was for their\r\nchildren, and for the sacred privilege of religious liberty, that they\r\nhad originally left the mother country. It was only for themselves and\r\ntheir children that they felt bound to labor. They sought no political\r\ninfluence in England. They did not wish to control elections, or\r\nregulate the finances, or interfere with the projects of military\r\naggrandizement. They were not represented in the English parliament,\r\nand they composed, politically speaking, no part of the English\r\nnation. Great, therefore, was their indignation, when they learned\r\nthat the English government was interfering with their chartered\r\nrights, and designed to raise a revenue from them to lighten taxes at\r\nhome, merely to support the government in foolish wars. If they could\r\nbe taxed, without their consent, in any thing, they could be taxed\r\nwithout limit; and they would be in danger of becoming mere slaves of\r\nthe mother country, and be bound to labor for English aggrandizement.\r\nOn one point they insisted with peculiar earnestness--that taxation,\r\nin a free country, without a representation of interests in\r\nparliament, was an outrage. It was on account of this arbitrary\r\ntaxation that Charles\xc2\xa0I. lost his crown, and the second revolution was\r\neffected, which placed the house of Hanover on the throne. The\r\ncolonies felt that, if the subjects of the king at home were justified\r\nin resisting unlawful taxes, they surely, on another continent, and\r\nwithout a representation, had a right to do so also; that, if they\r\nwere to be taxed without their consent, they would be in a worse\r\ncondition than even the people of Ireland; would be in the condition\r\nof a conquered people, without the protection which even a conquered\r\ncountry enjoyed. Hence they remonstrated, and prepared themselves for\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Stamp Act.]\r\n\r\nThe English government was so blinded as not to perceive or feel the\r\nforce of the reasoning of the colonists, and obstinately resolved to\r\nresort to measures which, with a free and spirited people, must\r\nnecessarily lead to violence and strife. The House of Commons would\r\nnot even hear the reports of the colonial agents, but proceeded, with\r\nstrange infatuation and obstinate bigotry, to impose the Stamp Act,\r\n(1765.) There were some, however, who perceived its folly and\r\ninjustice. General Conway protested against the assumed right of the\r\ngovernment, and Colonel Barr\xc3\xa9, a speaker of great eminence, exclaimed,\r\nin reply to the speech of Charles Townshend, who styled the colonies\r\n"children planted by our care, and nourished by our indulgence,"--"They\r\nplanted by your care!--No! your oppressions planted them in America;\r\nthey fled from your tyranny to a then uncultivated wilderness, exposed\r\nto all the hardships to which human nature is liable! They nourished\r\nby your indulgence!--No! they grew by your neglect; your _care_ of\r\nthem was displayed in sending persons to govern them who were the\r\ndeputies of deputies of ministers--men whose behavior, on many\r\noccasions, has caused the blood of those sons of liberty to recoil\r\nwithin them; men who have been promoted to the highest seats of\r\njustice in a foreign country, in order to escape being brought to the\r\nbar of a court of justice in their own." Mr. Pitt opposed the fatal\r\npolicy of Grenville with singular eloquence; by arguments which went\r\nbeyond acts of parliament; by an appeal to the natural reason; and by\r\nrecognition of the great, inalienable principles of liberty. He\r\nmaintained that the House had _no right_ to lay an internal tax upon\r\nAmerica, _that country not being represented_. Burke, too, then a new\r\nspeaker, raised his voice against the folly and injustice of taxing\r\nthe colonies; but it was in vain. The commons were bent on imposing\r\nthe Stamp Act.\r\n\r\nBut the passage of this act created great disturbances in America, and\r\nwas every where regarded as the beginning of great calamities.\r\nThroughout the colonies there was a general combination to resist the\r\nstamp duty; and it was resolved to purchase no English manufactures,\r\nand to prevent the adoption of stamped paper.\r\n\r\nSuch violent and unexpected opposition embarrassed the English\r\nministry; which, in addition to the difficulties attending the\r\nprosecution of Wilkes, led to the retirement of Grenville, who was\r\nsucceeded by the Marquis of Rockingham. During his short\r\nadministration, the Stamp Act was repealed, although the Commons still\r\ninsisted on their right to tax America. The joy which this repeal\r\ncreated in the colonies was unbounded; and the speech of Pitt, who\r\nproposed the repeal, and defended it with unprecedented eloquence, was\r\nevery where read with enthusiasm, and served to strengthen the\r\nconviction, among the leading men in the colonies, that their cause\r\nwas right. Lord Rockingham did not long remain at the head of the\r\ngovernment, and was succeeded by the Duke of Grafton; although Mr.\r\nPitt, recently created Earl of Chatham, was virtually the prime\r\nminister. Lord Rockingham retired from office with a high character\r\nfor pure and disinterested patriotism, and without securing place,\r\npension, or reversion, to himself or to any of his adherents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Chatham.]\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Lord Chatham to the peerage destroyed his popularity\r\nand weakened his power. No man ever made a greater mistake than he did\r\nin consenting to an apparent elevation. He had long been known and\r\ndesignated as the _Great Commoner_. The people were proud of him and,\r\nas a commoner, he could have ruled the nation, in spite of all\r\nopposition. No other man could have averted the national calamities.\r\nBut, as a peer, he no longer belonged to the people, and the people\r\nlost confidence in him, and abandoned him. What he gained in dignity\r\nhe lost in power and popularity. The people now compared him with Lord\r\nBath, and he became the object of universal calumny.\r\n\r\nAnd Chatham felt the change which had taken place in the nation. He\r\nhad ever loved and courted popularity, and that was the source of his\r\npower. He now lost his spirits, and interested himself but little in\r\npublic affairs. He relapsed into a state of indolence and apathy. He\r\nremained only the shadow of a mighty name; and, sequestered in the\r\ngroves of his family residence, ceased to be mentioned by the public.\r\nHe became melancholy, nervous, and unfit for business. Nor could he be\r\ninduced to attend a cabinet council, even on the most pressing\r\noccasions. He pretended to be ill, and would not hold conference with\r\nhis colleagues. Nor did he have the influence with the king which he\r\nhad a right to expect. Being no longer beloved by the people, he was\r\nno longer feared by the king. He was like Samson when deprived of his\r\nlocks--without strength; for his strength lay in the confidence and\r\naffections of the nation. He opposed his colleagues in their\r\nresolution to impose new taxes on America, but his counsels were\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nThese taxes were in the shape of duties on glass, paper, lead, and\r\npainters\' colors, from which no considerable revenue could be gained,\r\nand much discontent would inevitably result. When the news of this new\r\ntaxation reached the colonies, it destroyed all the cheerfulness which\r\nthe repeal of the Stamp Act had caused. Sullenness and gloom returned.\r\nTrust in parliament was diminished. New combinations of opposition\r\nwere organized, and the newspapers teemed with invective.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these disturbances, Lord Chatham resigned the Privy\r\nSeal, the office he had selected, and retired from the administration,\r\n(1768.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Administration of Lord North.]\r\n\r\nIn 1770, the Duke of Grafton also resigned his office as first lord of\r\nthe treasury, chiefly in consequence of the increasing difficulties\r\nwith America; and Lord North, who had been two years chancellor of the\r\nexchequer, took his place. He was an amiable and accomplished\r\nnobleman, and had many personal friends, and few personal enemies; but\r\nhe was unfit to manage the helm of state in the approaching storm.\r\n\r\nIt was his misfortune to be minister in the most unsettled and\r\nrevolutionary times, and to misunderstand not merely the spirit of the\r\nage, but the character and circumstances of the American colonies.\r\nGeorge\xc2\xa0III., with singular obstinacy and blindness, sustained the\r\nminister against all opposition; and under his administration the\r\nAmerican war was carried on, which ended so disastrously to the mother\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAs this great and eventful war will be the subject of the next\r\nchapter, the remaining events of interest, connected with the domestic\r\nhistory of England, will be first presented.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these were the discontents of the Irish.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1762, associations of the peasantry were formed with a\r\nview to political reforms and changes, and these popular\r\ndemonstrations of the discontented have ever since marked the history\r\nof the Irish nation--ever poor, ever oppressed, ever on the eve of\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Functions of the Parliament.]\r\n\r\nThe first circumstance, however, after the accession of George\xc2\xa0III.,\r\nwhich claims particular notice, was the passing of the Octennial Bill,\r\nin 1788. The Irish parliament, unlike the English, continued in\r\nexistence during the life of the sovereign. In 1761, an attempt had\r\nbeen made by the patriotic party to limit its duration, and to place\r\nit upon the same footing as the parliament of England; but this did\r\nnot succeed. Lord Townshend, at this period, was lord lieutenant, and\r\nit was the great object of his government to break the power of the\r\nIrish aristocracy, and to take out of their hands the distribution of\r\npensions and places, which hitherto had, from motives of policy, been\r\nallowed them. He succeeded in his object, though by unjustifiable\r\nmeans, and the British government became the source of all honor and\r\nemolument. During his administration, some disturbances broke out in\r\nUlster, in consequence of the system which then prevailed of letting\r\nland on fines. As a great majority of the peasantry and small farmers\r\nwere unable to pay these fines, and were consequently deprived of\r\ntheir farms, they became desperate, and committed violent outrages on\r\nthose who had taken their lands. Government was obliged to resort to\r\nmilitary force, and many distressed people were driven to America for\r\nsubsistence. To Ireland there appeared no chance of breaking the\r\nthraldom which England in other respects also exercised, when the\r\nAmerican war broke out. This immediately changed the language and\r\ncurrent of the British government in reference to Ireland; proposals\r\nwere made favorable to Irish commerce; and some penal statutes against\r\nCatholics were annulled. Still the patriots of Ireland aimed at much\r\ngreater privileges than had as yet been granted, and the means to\r\nsecure these were apparent. England had drawn from Ireland nearly all\r\nthe regular forces, in order to send them to America, and the\r\nsea-coast of Ireland was exposed to invasion. In consequence of the\r\ndefenceless state of the country, the inhabitants of the town of\r\nBelfast, in 1779, entered into armed associations to defend themselves\r\nin case of necessity. This gave rise to a system of volunteers, which\r\nsoon was extended over the island. The Irish now began to feel their\r\nstrength; and even Lord North admitted, in the House of Commons, the\r\nnecessity of granting to them still greater privileges, and carried a\r\nbill through parliament, which removed some grievous commercial\r\nrestrictions. But the Irish looked to greater objects, and especially\r\nsince Lord North, in order to carry his bill, represented it as a boon\r\nresumable at pleasure, rather than as a right to which the Irish were\r\nproperly entitled. This bill, therefore, instead of quieting the\r\npatriots, led to a desire for an independent parliament of their own.\r\nA union was formed of volunteers to secure this end, not composed of\r\nthe ignorant peasantry, but of all classes, at the head of which was\r\nthe Duke of Leinster himself. In 1781, this association of volunteers\r\nhad a force of fifty thousand disciplined men; and it moreover formed\r\ncommittees of correspondence, which naturally alarmed the British\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThese and other disturbances, added to the disasters in America,\r\ninduced the House of Commons to pass censure on Lord North and his\r\ncolleague, as incapable of managing the helm of state. The king,\r\ntherefore, was compelled to dismiss his ministers, whose\r\nadministration had proved the most disastrous in British annals. Lord\r\nNorth, however, had uncommon difficulties to contend with, and might\r\nhave governed the nation with honor in ordinary times. He resigned in\r\n1782, four years after the death of Chatham, and the Marquis of\r\nBuckingham, a second time, was placed at the head of the government.\r\nMr. Fox and Mr. Burke also obtained places, and the Whigs were once\r\nmore triumphant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irish Discontents.]\r\n\r\nThe attention of the new ministry was imperatively demanded by the\r\ndiscontents in Ireland, and important concessions were made. Mr.\r\nGrattan moved an address to the king, which was unanimously carried in\r\nboth Houses, in which it was declared that "the crown of Ireland was\r\ninseparably annexed to the crown of Great Britain; but that the\r\nkingdom of Ireland was a distinct kingdom, with a parliament of her\r\nown, the sole legislature thereof; that in this right they conceived\r\nthe very essence of their liberty to exist; that in behalf of all the\r\npeople of Ireland, they claimed this as their birthright, and could\r\nnot relinquish it but with their lives; that they had a high\r\nveneration for the British character; and that, in sharing the freedom\r\nof England, it was their determination to share also her fate, and to\r\nstand and fall with the British nation." The new lord lieutenant, the\r\nDuke of Portland, assured the Irish parliament that the British\r\nlegislature had resolved to remove the cause of discontent, and a law\r\nwas actually passed which placed the Irish parliament on the same\r\nfooting as that of England. Acts were also passed for the right of\r\nhabeas corpus, and for the independence of the judges.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers, having accomplished the objects which they originally\r\ncontemplated, did not, however, disband, but now directed their\r\nefforts to a reform in parliament. But the House of Commons rejected\r\nthe proposition offered by Mr. Flood, and the convention, appointed by\r\nthe volunteers, indefinitely adjourned without persevering, as it\r\nshould have done. The volunteer system soon after declined.\r\n\r\nThe cause of parliamentary reform, though no longer supported by the\r\nvolunteers in their associate character, was not deserted by the\r\npeople, or by their advocates in parliament. Among these advocates was\r\nWilliam Pitt himself. But in 1783, he became prime minister, and\r\nchanged his opinions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protestant Association.]\r\n\r\nBut before the administration of Pitt can be presented, an event in\r\nthe domestic history of England must be alluded to, which took place\r\nduring the administration of Lord North. This was the Protestant\r\nAssociation, headed by Lord George Gordon, and the riots to which it\r\nled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord George Gordon\'s Riots.]\r\n\r\nIn 1780, parliament had passed an act relieving Roman Catholics from\r\nsome of the heavy penalties inflicted on them in the preceding\r\ncentury. It relieved bishops, priests, and schoolmasters from\r\nprosecution and imprisonment, gave security to the rights of\r\ninheritance, and permission to purchase lands on fee simple. This act\r\nof toleration was generally opposed in England; but the fanatical\r\nspirit of Presbyterianism in Scotland was excited in view of this\r\nreasonable indulgence, to a large body of men, of the rights of\r\nconscience and civil liberty. On the bare rumor of the intended\r\nindulgence, great tumults took place in Edinburgh and Glasgow; the\r\nRoman Catholic chapel was destroyed, and the houses of the principal\r\nCatholics were attacked and plundered. Nor did the magistracy check or\r\npunish these disorders with any spirit, but secretly favored the\r\nrioters. Encouraged by the indifference of the magistrates, the\r\nfanatics formed themselves into a society called the _Protestant\r\nAssociation_, to oppose any remission of the present unjust laws; and\r\nof this association Lord George Gordon was chosen president. He was\r\nthe son of the Duke of Gordon, belonging to one of the most ancient of\r\nthe Scottish nobility, but a man in the highest degree wild and\r\nfanatical. He was also a member of parliament, and opposed the views\r\nof the most enlightened statesmen of his time, and with an\r\nextravagance which led to the belief that he was insane. He\r\ncalumniated the king, defied the parliament, and boasted of the number\r\nof his adherents. He pretended that he had, in Scotland, one hundred\r\nand sixty thousand men at his command, who would cut off the king\'s\r\nhead, if he did not keep his coronation oath. The enthusiasm of the\r\nScotch soon spread to the English; and, throughout the country,\r\nassociations were affiliated with the parent societies in London and\r\nEdinburgh, of both of which Lord Gordon was president. At Coachmakers\'\r\nHall he assembled his adherents; and, in an incendiary harangue,\r\ninflamed the minds of an immense audience in regard to the Church of\r\nRome, with the usual invectives respecting its idolatry and\r\ncorruption. He urged them to violent courses, as the only way to stop\r\nthe torrent of Catholicism which was desolating the land. Soon after,\r\nthis association assembled at St. George\'s Fields, to the astonishing\r\nnumber of fifty thousand people, marshalled in separate bands, with\r\nblue cockades; and this immense rabble proceeded through the city of\r\nLondon to the House of Parliament, preceded by a man carrying a\r\npetition signed by twelve hundred thousand names. The rabble took\r\npossession of the lobby of the house, making the old palace ring with\r\ntheir passionate cries of "No popery! no popery!" This mob was\r\nharangued by Lord Gordon himself, in the lobby of the house, while the\r\nmatter was discussed among the members. The military were drawn out,\r\nand the mob was dispersed for a time, but soon assembled again, and\r\nbecame still more alarming. Houses were plundered, churches were\r\nentered, and the city set on fire in thirty-six different places. The\r\npeople were obliged to chalk on their houses "No popery," and pay\r\ncontributions to prevent their being sacked. The prisons were emptied\r\nof both felons and debtors. Lord Mansfield\'s splendid residence was\r\ndestroyed, together with his pictures, furniture, and invaluable law\r\nlibrary. Martial law was finally proclaimed--the last resort in cases\r\nof rebellion, and never resorted to but in extreme cases; and the\r\nmilitary did what magistrates could not do--restored order and law.\r\nHad not the city been decreed to be in a state of rebellion, the\r\nrioters would have taken the bank, which they had already attacked.\r\nFive hundred persons were killed in the riot, and Lord George Gordon\r\nwas committed to the Tower. He, however, escaped conviction, through\r\nthe extraordinary talents of his counsel, Mr. Erskine and Mr. Kenyon;\r\nbut one hundred others were capitally convicted. This disgraceful riot\r\nopened the eyes of the people to the horrors of popular insurrection,\r\nand perhaps prevented a revolution in England, when other questions,\r\nof more practical importance, agitated the nation.\r\n\r\nBut no reform of importance took place until the administration of\r\nWilliam Pitt. Mr. Burke attempted to secure some economical\r\nretrenchments, which were strongly opposed. But what was a\r\nretrenchment of two hundred thousand pounds a year, when compared with\r\nthe vast expenditures of the British armies in America and in India?\r\nBut though the reforms which Burke projected were not radical or\r\nimportant, they contributed to raise his popularity with the people,\r\nwho were more annoyed by the useless offices connected with the king\'s\r\nhousehold, than by the expenditure of millions in war. At first, his\r\nscheme received considerable attention, and the members listened to\r\nhis propositions so long as they were abstract and general. But when\r\nhe proceeded to specific reforms, they no longer regarded his voice,\r\nand he was obliged to abandon his task as hopeless. William Pitt made\r\nhis first speech in the debate which Burke had excited, and argued in\r\nfavor of retrenchment with the eloquence of his father, but with more\r\nmethod and clearness. The bill was lost, but Burke finally succeeded\r\nin carrying his measures; and the offices of the master of the\r\nharriers, the master of the staghounds, the clerk of the green cloth,\r\nand some other unimportant sinecures, were abolished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliamentary Reforms.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reform Questions.]\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at that great representative reform which afterwards\r\nconvulsed the nation, was made by William Pitt. He brought forward two\r\nresolutions, to prevent bribery at elections, and secure a more\r\nequitable representation. But he did not succeed; and Pitt himself,\r\nwhen his cause was advocated by men of a different spirit,--men\r\ninflamed by revolutionary principles,--changed his course, and opposed\r\nparliamentary reform with more ardor than he had at first advocated\r\nit. But parliamentary reform did not become an object of absorbing\r\ninterest until the times of Henry Brougham and Lord John Russell.\r\n\r\nNo other great events were sufficiently prominent to be here alluded\r\nto, until the ministry of William Pitt.

Its importance was not fully appreciated when it took\r\nplace, but still excited a great interest throughout the civilized\r\nworld. It was the main subject which engrossed the attention and\r\ncalled out the energies of British statesmen, during the\r\nadministration of Lord North. In America, of course, all other\r\nsubjects were trivial in comparison with it. The contest is memorable\r\nfor the struggles of heroes, for the development of unknown energies,\r\nfor the establishment of a new western empire, for the triumph of the\r\ncause of liberty, and for the moral effects which resulted, even in\r\nother countries, from the examples of patriots who preferred the glory\r\nand honor of their country to their own aggrandizement.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the struggle have been already alluded to in the\r\nselfishness and folly of British statesmen, who sought to relieve the\r\nburdens of the English people by taxing the colonies. The colonies\r\nwere doubtless regarded by the British parliament without proper\r\naffection or consideration; somewhat in the light of a conquered\r\nnation, from which England might derive mercantile advantage. The\r\ncolonies were not ruled in a spirit of conciliation, nor were the\r\nAmerican people fully appreciated. Some, perhaps, like Chatham and\r\nBurke, may have known the virtues and the power of the colonial\r\npopulation, and may have had some glimpse of the glory and greatness\r\nto which America was destined. But they composed but a small minority\r\nof the nation, and their advice and remonstrances were generally\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Causes of the Revolution.]\r\n\r\nSerious disturbances did not take place until Lord North commenced his\r\nunfortunate administration, (1770.) Although the colonies were then\r\nresolved not to submit to unlawful taxation, and to an oppressive\r\ngovernment, independence was not contemplated. Conciliatory measures,\r\nif they had been at that time adopted, probably would have deferred\r\nthe Revolution. But the contest must have occurred, at a later date;\r\nfor nothing, in the ordinary course of events, could have prevented\r\nthe ultimate independence of the colonies. Their rapid growth, the\r\nextent of the country in which settlements were made, its distance\r\nfrom England, the spirit of liberty which animated the people, their\r\ngeneral impatience under foreign restraint, and the splendid prospects\r\nof future greatness which were open to their eyes, must have led to a\r\nrupture with the mother country at no distant time.\r\n\r\nThe colonies, at the commencement of their difficulties, may have\r\nexaggerated their means of resistance, but not their future greatness.\r\nAll of them, from New Hampshire to Georgia, were animated by a spirit\r\nof liberty which no misfortunes could crush. A large majority of the\r\npeople were willing to incur the dangers incident to revolution, not\r\nfor themselves merely, but for the sake of their posterity, and for\r\nthe sacred cause of liberty. They felt that their cause was just, and\r\nthat Providence would protect and aid them in their defence.\r\n\r\nA minute detail of the events of the American Revolution, of course,\r\ncannot be expected in a history like this. Only the more prominent\r\nevents can be alluded to. The student is supposed to be familiar with\r\nthe details of the conflict, which are to be read in the works of\r\nnumerous American authors.\r\n\r\nLord North, at the commencement of his administration, repealed the\r\nobnoxious duties which had been imposed in 1767, but still retained\r\nthe duty on tea, with a view chiefly to assert the supremacy of Great\r\nBritain, and her right to tax the colonies. This course of the\r\nminister cannot be regarded in any other light than that of the\r\nblindest infatuation.\r\n\r\nThe imposition of the port duties, by Grenville, had fomented\r\ninnumerable disturbances, and had led to universal discussion as to\r\nthe nature and extent of parliamentary power. A distinction, at first,\r\nhad been admitted between internal and external taxes; but it was soon\r\nasserted that Great Britain had no right to tax the colonies, either\r\ninternally or externally. It was stated that the colonies had received\r\ncharters, under the great seal, which had given them all the rights\r\nand privileges of Englishmen at home and therefore that they could not\r\nbe taxed, except by their own consent; that this consent had never\r\nbeen asked or granted; that they were unrepresented in the imperial\r\nparliament; and that the taxes which had been imposed by their own\r\nrespective legislatures were, in many instances, greater than what\r\nwere paid by the people of England--taxes too, incurred, to a great\r\ndegree, to preserve the jurisdiction of Great Britain on the American\r\ncontinent. The colonies were every where exceedingly indignant with\r\nthe course the mother country had pursued with reference to them.\r\nPatrick Henry, a Virginian, supported the cause of liberty with\r\nunrivalled eloquence and power, as did John Adams, Josiah Quincy, Jr.,\r\nJames Otis, and other patriots in Massachusetts. Riots took place in\r\nBoston, Newport, and New York, and assemblies of citizens in various\r\nparts expressed an indignant and revolutionary spirit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Riots and Disturbances.]\r\n\r\nThe residence of the military at Boston was, moreover, the occasion of\r\nperpetual tumult. The people abused the soldiers, vilified them in\r\nnewspapers, and insulted them in the street. Mutual animosity was the\r\nresult. Rancor and insults produced riot, and the troops fired upon\r\nthe people. So great was the disturbances, that the governor was\r\nreluctantly obliged to remove the military from the town. The General\r\nCourt was then removed to Cambridge, but refused to enter upon\r\nbusiness unless it were convened in Boston. Fresh disturbances\r\nfollowed. The governor quarrelled with the legislature, and a complete\r\nanarchy began to prevail. The public mind was inflamed by effigies,\r\npaintings, and incendiary articles in the newspapers. The parliament\r\nwas represented as corrupt, the ministry as venal, the king as a\r\ntyrant, and England itself as a rotten, old, aristocratic structure,\r\ncrumbling to pieces. The tide was so overwhelming in favor of\r\nresistance, that even moderate men were borne along in the current;\r\nand those who kept aloof from the excitement were stigmatized as timid\r\nand selfish, and the enemies of their country. The courts of justice\r\nwere virtually silenced, since juries disregarded the charges of the\r\njudges. Libels were unnoticed, and the rioters were unpunished.\r\nSmuggling was carried on to a great extent, and revenue officers were\r\ninsulted in the discharge of their duties. Obnoxious persons were\r\ntarred and feathered, and exposed to public derision and scorn. In\r\nProvidence, they burnt the revenue cutter, and committees were formed\r\nin the principal towns who fanned the flame of sedition. The committee\r\nin Boston, in 1773, framed a celebrated document, called the _Bill of\r\nRights_, in which the authority of parliament to legislate for the\r\ncolonies, in any respect, was denied, and in which the salaries\r\ndecreed by the crown to the governor and judges were considered as a\r\nsystematic attempt to enslave the land.\r\n\r\nThe public discontents were further inflamed by the information which\r\nDr. Franklin, then in London, afforded the colonies, and the advice he\r\ngave them to persevere, assuring them that, if they were firm, they\r\nhad nothing to apprehend. Moreover, he got into his possession a copy\r\nof the letters of Governor Hutchinson to the ministry, which he\r\ntransmitted to the colonies, and which by them were made public. These\r\nletters were considered by the legislature of Massachusetts as unjust\r\nand libellous, and his recall was demanded. Resolutions, of an\r\noffensive character to the English, were every where passed, and all\r\nthings indicated an approaching storm. The crisis was at hand. The\r\noutrage, in Boston harbor, of throwing overboard three hundred and\r\nforty-two chests of tea, which the East India Company had sent to\r\nAmerica, consummated the difficulties, and induced the government to\r\nresort to more coercive measures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duty on Tea.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the power of Lord North to terminate the difficulties with\r\nthe colonies when the East India Company urged him to repeal the duty\r\nof threepence per pound on tea, and offered to pay sixpence per pound\r\nin lieu of it, as export duty, if permitted to import it into the\r\ncolonies duty free. The company was induced to make this proposition\r\nin view of the great accumulation of tea in England; but the\r\ngovernment, more solicitous about the right than the revenue, would\r\nnot consent. The colonists were equally determined to resist taxation,\r\nnot on account of immediate burdens, but upon principle, and therefore\r\nresolved to prevent the landing of the tea. A multitude rushed to the\r\nwharf, and twenty persons, disguised as Indians, went on board the\r\nships laden with it, staved the chests, and threw their contents into\r\nthe sea. In New York and Philadelphia, as no persons could be found\r\nwho would venture to receive the tea sent to those ports, the ships\r\nladen with it returned to England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Port of Boston Closed.]\r\n\r\nThe ministers of the crown were especially indignant with the province\r\nof Massachusetts, which had always been foremost in resistance, and\r\nthe scene of the greatest disorders, and therefore resolved to block\r\nup the port of Boston. Accordingly, in 1774 they introduced a bill to\r\ndiscontinue the lading and shipping of goods, wares, and merchandise\r\nat Boston, and to remove the custom-house to Salem. The bill received\r\nthe general approbation of the House, and passed by a great majority.\r\n\r\nNo measure could possibly have been more impolitic. A large force\r\nshould have been immediately sent to the colonies, to coerce them,\r\nbefore they had time to organize sufficient force to resist the mother\r\ncountry, or conciliatory measures should have been adopted. But the\r\nHouse was angry and infatuated, and the voice of wisdom was\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nSoon after, Lord North introduced another bill for the better\r\ngovernment of the provinces, which went to subvert the charter of the\r\ncolony, and to violate all the principles of liberty and justice. By\r\nthis bill, the nomination of counsellors, judges, sheriffs, and\r\nmagistrates of all kinds, was vested in the crown; and these were also\r\nremovable at pleasure. The ministers, in advocating the bill, urged\r\nthe ground of necessity, the universal spirit of disaffection, which\r\nbordered on actual rebellion. The bill was carried, by a majority of\r\ntwo hundred and thirty-nine against sixty-four voices, May 2, 1774.\r\n\r\nThe next step of the minister was to bring in a bill which provided\r\nthat, in case any person was indicted in Massachusetts for a capital\r\noffence, and that, if it should appear that a fair trial could not be\r\nhad in the province, the prisoner might be sent to any other colony,\r\nor even to Great Britain itself, to be tried. This was insult added to\r\ninjury, and met with vigorous resistance even in parliament itself.\r\nBut it nevertheless passed through both Houses.\r\n\r\nWhen intelligence arrived concerning it, and of the other bills, a\r\nfire was kindled in the colonies not easily to be extinguished. There\r\nwas scarcely a place which did not convene its assembly. Popular\r\norators, in the public halls and in the churches, every where inflamed\r\nthe people by incendiary discourses; organizations were made to\r\nabstain from all commerce with the mother country; and measures were\r\nadopted to assemble a General Congress, to take into consideration the\r\nstate of the country. People began to talk of defending their rights\r\nby the sword. Every where was heard the sound of the drum and the\r\nfife. All were fired by the spirit of liberty. Associations were\r\nformed for the purchase of arms and ammunition. Addresses were printed\r\nand circulated calling on the people to arm themselves, and resist\r\nunlawful encroachment. All proceedings in the courts of justice were\r\nsuspended. Jurors refused to take their oaths; the reign of law\r\nceased, and that of violence commenced. Governor Gage, who had\r\nsucceeded Hutchinson, fortified Boston Neck, and cut off the\r\ncommunication of the town with the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meeting of Congress.]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the Continental Congress met at Philadelphia, in\r\nwhich all the colonies were represented but Georgia. Congress passed\r\nresolutions approving the course of Massachusetts, and also a bill\r\ncalled a _Declaration of Rights_. It sent an address to the king,\r\nframed with great ability, in which it discussed the rights of the\r\ncolonies, complained of the mismanagement of ministers, and besought a\r\nredress of the public evils.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Speech of Burke.]\r\n\r\nBut this congress was considered by the government of Great Britain as\r\nan illegal body, and its petition was disregarded. But the ministers\r\nno longer regarded the difficulties as trifling, and sought to remedy\r\nthem, though not in the right way. The more profound of the English\r\nstatesmen fully perceived the danger and importance of the crisis, and\r\nmany of them took the side of liberty. Dean Tucker, who foresaw a long\r\nwar, with all its expenses, urged, in a masterly treatise, the\r\nnecessity of giving the Americans, at once, the liberty they sought.\r\nOthers, who overrated the importance of the colonies in a mercantile\r\nview, wished to retain them, but to adopt conciliatory measures. Lord\r\nChatham put forth all the eloquence of which he was such a master, to\r\narouse the ministers. He besought them to withdraw the troops from\r\nBoston. He showed the folly of metaphysical refinements about the\r\nright of taxation when a continent was in arms. He spoke of the means\r\nof enforcing thraldom as inefficient and ridiculous. Lord Camden\r\nsustained Chatham in the House of Lords, and declared, not as a\r\nphilosopher, but as a constitutional lawyer, that England had no right\r\nto tax America. Mr. Burke moved a conciliatory measure in the House of\r\nCommons, fraught with wisdom and knowledge. "My hold of the colonies,"\r\nsaid this great oracle of moral wisdom, "is the close affection which\r\ngrows from the common names, from the kindred blood, from similar\r\nprivileges, and from equal protection. These are the ties which,\r\nthough light as air, are as strong as links of iron. Let the colonies\r\nalways keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your\r\ngovernment; they will cling and grapple with you, and no power under\r\nheaven will be able to tear them from their allegiance. But let it\r\nonce be understood that your government may be one thing, and their\r\nprivileges another, then the cement is gone, and every thing hastens\r\nto dissolution. It is the love of the people, it is their attachment\r\nto your government from the sense in the deep stake they have in such\r\nglorious institutions, which gives you your army and navy, and infuses\r\ninto both that liberal obedience without which your army would be but\r\na base rabble, and your navy nothing but rotten timber." But this\r\nelevated and sublime wisdom was regarded as a philosophical\r\nabstraction, as a vain and impractical view of political affairs, well\r\nenough for a writer on the "sublime and beautiful," but absurd in a\r\nBritish statesman. Colonel Barr\xc3\xa9 and Fox supported Burke; but their\r\neloquence had not much effect on the Commons, and the ministry was\r\nsupported in their measures. The colonies were declared to be in a\r\nstate of rebellion, and measures were adopted to crush them.\r\n\r\nTo declare the colonies in a state of rebellion was, in fact, to\r\ndeclare war. And this was perfectly understood by the popular leaders\r\nwho fanned the spirit of resistance. All ideas of reconciliation now\r\nbecame chimerical. Necessity stimulated the timid, and vengeance\r\nexcited the bold. It was felt that the people were now to choose\r\nbetween liberty and slavery, and slavery was, of course, regarded as\r\nworse than death. "We must look back," said the popular orators, "no\r\nmore! We must conquer or die! We are placed between altars smoking\r\nwith the most grateful incense of glory and gratitude on the one part,\r\nand blocks and dungeons on the other. Let each, then, rise and gird\r\nhimself for the conflict. The dearest interests of the world command\r\nit; our most holy religion requires it. Let us banish fear, and\r\nremember that fortune smiles only on the brave."\r\n\r\nSuch was the general state of feeling; and there only needed a spark\r\nto kindle a conflagration. That spark was kindled at Lexington.\r\nGeneral Gage, the governor, having learned that military stores and\r\narms were deposited at Concord, resolved to seize them. His design was\r\nsuspected, and the people prepared to resist his orders. The alarm\r\nbells were rung, and the cannons were fired. The provincial militia\r\nassembled, and the English retreated to Lexington. That village\r\nwitnessed the commencement of a long and sanguinary war. The tide of\r\nrevolution could no longer be repressed. The colonies were now\r\nresolved to achieve their independence.\r\n\r\nThe Continental Congress met on the 10th of May, 1775, shortly after\r\nthe first blood had been shed at Lexington, and immediately proceeded\r\nto raise an army, establish a paper currency, and to dissolve the\r\ncompact between Great Britain and the Massachusetts colony. John\r\nHancock was chosen president of the assembly, and George Washington\r\ncommander-in-chief of the continental army. He accepted the\r\nappointment with a modesty only equalled by his merit, and soon after\r\ndeparted for the seat of war. For his associates, Congress appointed\r\nArtemas Ward, Charles Lee, Philip Schuyler, and Israel Putnam as\r\nmajor-generals, and Seth Pomeroy, Richard Montgomery, David Wooster,\r\nWilliam Heath, Joseph Spencer, John Thomas, John Sullivan, and\r\nNathanael Greene as brigadiers. Horatio Gates received the appointment\r\nof adjutant-general, with the rank of brigadier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Bunker Hill.]\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of June was fought the battle of Bunker Hill, which proved\r\nthe bravery of the Americans, and which was followed by great moral\r\nresults. But the Americans unfortunately lost, in this battle, Dr.\r\nWarren, who had espoused the cause of revolution with the same spirit\r\nthat Hampden did in England, and whom he resembled in genius,\r\npatriotism, and character. He had been chosen major-general four days\r\nbefore his death, but fought at Bunker Hill as a simple volunteer. On\r\nthe 2d of July, Washington took command of the army, and established\r\nhis head-quarters at Cambridge. The American army amounted to\r\nseventeen thousand men, of whom twenty-five hundred were unfit for\r\nduty. They were assembled on the spur of the occasion, and had but few\r\ntents and stores, no clothing, no military chest and no general\r\norganization. They were collected from the various provinces and were\r\ngoverned by their own militia laws. Of this material he constructed\r\nthe first continental army, and under innumerable vexations and\r\ndifficulties. No man was ever placed in a more embarrassing situation.\r\nHis troops were raw and undisciplined; and the members of the\r\nContinental Congress, from whom he received his commission, were not\r\nunited among themselves. He had all the responsibility of the war, and\r\nyet had not sufficient means to prosecute it with the vigor which the\r\ncolonies probably anticipated. His success, in the end, _was_ glorious\r\nand unequivocal; but none other than he could have secured it, and not\r\nhe, even, unless he had been sustained by a loftiness of character\r\nalmost preternatural.\r\n\r\nThe English forces, at this time, were centred in Boston under the\r\ncommand of General Gage, and were greatly inferior in point of numbers\r\nto the American troops who surrounded them. But the troops of Gage\r\nwere regulars and veterans, and were among the best in the English\r\narmy. He was recalled in order to give information to the government\r\nin reference to the battle of Bunker Hill, and was succeeded in\r\nOctober by General Howe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Montgomery.]\r\n\r\nThe first campaign of the war was signalized by the invasion of Canada\r\nby the American troops, with the hope of wresting that province from\r\nthe English, which was not only disaffected, but which was defended by\r\nan inconsiderable force. General Montgomery, with an army of three\r\nthousand, advanced to Montreal, which surrendered. The fortresses of\r\nCrown Point and Ticonderoga had already been taken by Colonel Ethan\r\nAllen. But the person who most distinguished himself in this\r\nunfortunate expedition was Colonel Benedict Arnold, who, with a\r\ndetachment of one thousand men, penetrated through the forests,\r\nswamps, and mountains of Maine, beyond the sources of the Kennebec\r\nand, in six weeks from his departure at Boston, arrived on the plains\r\nof Canada, opposite Quebec. He there effected a junction with the\r\ntroops of Montgomery, and made an assault on the strongest fortress in\r\nAmerica, defended by sixteen hundred men. The attack was unsuccessful,\r\nand Montgomery was killed. Arnold did not retire from the province,\r\nbut remained encamped upon the Heights of Abraham. This enterprise,\r\nthough a failure, was not without great moral results, since it showed\r\nto the English government the singular bravery and intrepidity of the\r\nnation it had undertaken to coerce.\r\n\r\nThe ministry then resolved upon vigorous measures, and, finding a\r\ndifficulty in raising men, applied to the Landgrave of Hesse for\r\nseventeen thousand mercenaries. These, added to twenty-five thousand\r\nmen enlisted in England, and the troops already sent to America,\r\nconstituted a force of fifty-five thousand men--deemed amply\r\nsufficient to reduce the rebellious colonies. But these were not sent\r\nto America until the next year.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, General Howe was encamped in Boston with a force,\r\nincluding seamen, of eleven thousand men, and General Washington, with\r\nan army of twenty-eight thousand, including militia, was determined to\r\nattack him. In February, 1776, he took possession of Dorchester\r\nHeights, which command the harbor. General Howe found it expedient to\r\nevacuate Boston, and sailed for Halifax with his army, and Washington\r\nrepaired to Philadelphia to deliberate with Congress.\r\n\r\nBut Howe retired from Boston only to occupy New York; and when his\r\narrangements were completed, he landed at Staten Island, waiting for\r\nthe arrival of his brother, Lord Howe, with the expected\r\nreinforcements. By the middle of August they had all arrived, and his\r\nunited forces amounted to twenty-four thousand men. Washington\'s army,\r\nthough it nominally numbered twenty thousand five hundred, still was\r\ncomposed of only about eleven thousand effective men, and these\r\nimperfectly provided with arms and ammunition. Nevertheless,\r\nWashington gave battle to the English; but the result was disastrous\r\nto the Americans, owing to the disproportion of the forces engaged.\r\nGeneral Howe took possession of Long Island, the Americans evacuated\r\nNew York, and, shortly after, the city fell into the hands of the\r\nEnglish. Washington, with his diminished army, posted himself at\r\nHaerlem Heights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Declaration of American Independence.]\r\n\r\nBut before the victory of Howe on Long Island was obtained, Congress\r\nhad declared the Independence of the American States, (4th July,\r\n1776.) This Declaration of Independence took the English nation by\r\nsurprise, and firmly united it against the colonies. It was received\r\nby the Americans, in every section of the country, with unbounded\r\nenthusiasm. Reconciliation was now impossible, and both countries were\r\narrayed against each other in fierce antagonism.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the campaign of 1776 was occupied by the belligerents\r\nin skirmishing, engagements, marchings and countermarchings, in the\r\nstates of New York and New Jersey. The latter state was overrun by the\r\nEnglish army, and success, on either side, was indecisive. Forts\r\nWashington and Lee were captured. General Lee was taken prisoner. The\r\ncapture of Lee, however, was not so great a calamity as it, at first,\r\nseemed; for, though a man of genius and military experience, his\r\nambition, vanity, and love of glory would probably have led to an\r\nopposition to his superior officer, and to Congress itself. To\r\ncompensate for the disasters in New Jersey, Washington, invested with\r\nnew and extraordinary power by Congress, gained the battles of\r\nPrinceton and Trenton, which were not only brilliant victories, but\r\nwere attended by great moral effects, and showed the difficulty of\r\nsubduing a people determined to be free. "Every one applauded the\r\nfirmness, the prudence, and the bravery of Washington. All declared\r\nhim to be the savior of his country; all proclaimed him equal to the\r\nmost renowned commanders of antiquity, and especially distinguished\r\nhim by the name of the _American Fabius_."\r\n\r\nThe greatness of Washington was seen, not so much by his victories at\r\nPrinceton and Trenton, or by his masterly retreat before superior\r\nforces, as by his admirable prudence and patience during the\r\nsucceeding winter. He had, for several months, a force which scarcely\r\nexceeded fifteen hundred men, and these suffered all manner of\r\nhardships and privations. After the first gush of enthusiasm had\r\npassed, it was found exceedingly difficult to enlist men, and still\r\nmore difficult to pay those who had enlisted. Congress, composed of\r\ngreat men, and of undoubted patriotism, on the whole, harmonized with\r\nthe commander-in-chief, whom, for six months, it invested with almost\r\ndictatorial power; still there were some of its members who did not\r\nfully appreciate the character or condition of Washington, and threw\r\ngreat difficulties in his way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commissioners Sent to France.]\r\n\r\nCongress about this time sent commissioners to France to solicit money\r\nand arms. These commissioners were Dr. Franklin, Silas Deane, and\r\nArthur Lee. They were not immediately successful; for the French king,\r\ndoubtful of the result of the struggle, did not wish to incur\r\nprematurely the hostility of Great Britain; but they induced many to\r\njoin the American cause, and among others, the young Marquis de La\r\nFayette, who arrived in America in the spring of 1777, and proved a\r\nmost efficient general, and secured the confidence and love of the\r\nnation he assisted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Burgoyne.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1777 was marked by the evacuation of the Jerseys by\r\nthe English, by the battles of Bennington and Brandywine, by the\r\ncapture of Philadelphia, and the surrender of Burgoyne. Success, on\r\nthe whole, was in favor of the Americans. They suffered a check at\r\nBrandywine, and lost the most considerable city in the Union at that\r\ntime. But these disasters were more than compensated by the victory at\r\nBennington and the capture of Burgoyne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moral Effects of Burgoyne\'s Capture.]\r\n\r\nThis indeed was the great event of the campaign. Burgoyne was a member\r\nof parliament, and superseded General Carleton in the command of the\r\nnorthern army--an injudicious appointment, but made by the minister in\r\norder to carry his measures more easily through the House of Commons.\r\nThe troops under his command amounted to over seven thousand veterans,\r\nbesides a corps of artillery. He set out from St. John\'s, the 16th of\r\nJune, and advanced to Ticonderoga, which he invested. The American\r\nforces, under General Schuyler, destined to oppose this royal army,\r\nand to defend Ticonderoga, were altogether insufficient, being not\r\nover five thousand men. The fortress was therefore abandoned, and the\r\nBritish general advanced to the Hudson, hoping to open a communication\r\nbetween it and Lake Champlain, and thus completely surround New\r\nEngland, and isolate it from the rest of the country. But the delays\r\nattending the march of the English army through the forests enabled\r\nthe Americans to rally. The defeat of Colonel Baum at Bennington, by\r\nColonel Stark, added to the embarrassments of Burgoyne, who now was\r\nstraitened for provisions; nevertheless, he continued his march,\r\nhoping to reach Albany unmolested. But the Americans, commanded by\r\nGeneral Gates, who had superseded Schuyler, were strongly intrenched\r\nat the principal passes on his route, and had fortified the high\r\ngrounds. The army of Burgoyne was moreover attacked by the Americans\r\nat Stillwater, and he was forced to retreat to Saratoga. His army was\r\nnow reduced to five thousand men; he had only three days\' provisions;\r\nall the passes were filled by the enemy, and he was completely\r\nsurrounded by fifteen thousand men. Under these circumstances, he was\r\nforced to surrender. His troops laid down their arms, but were allowed\r\nto embark at Boston for Europe. The Americans, by this victory,\r\nacquired forty-two pieces of brass artillery, four thousand six\r\nhundred muskets, and an immense quantity of military stores. This\r\nsurrender of Burgoyne was the greatest disaster which the British\r\ntroops had thus far experienced, and raised the spirits of the\r\nAmericans to the highest pitch. Indeed, this surrender decided the\r\nfate of the war, for it proved the impossibility of conquering the\r\nAmericans. It showed that they fought under infinitely greater\r\nadvantages, since it was in their power always to decline a battle,\r\nand to choose their ground. It showed that the country presented\r\ndifficulties which were insurmountable. It mattered but little that\r\ncities were taken, when the great body of the people resided in the\r\ncountry, and were willing to make sacrifices, and were commanded by\r\nsuch generals as Washington, Gates, Greene, Putnam, and Lee. The\r\nEnglish ministry ought to have seen the nature of the contest; but a\r\nstrange infatuation blinded the nation. There were some, however, whom\r\nno national pride could blind. Lord Chatham was one of these men. "No\r\nman," said this veteran statesman, "thinks more highly of the virtues\r\nand valor of British troops than I do. I know that they can achieve\r\nany thing except impossibilities. But the conquest of America is an\r\nimpossibility."\r\n\r\nThere was one nation in Europe who viewed the contest with different\r\neyes. This nation was France, then on the eve of revolution itself,\r\nand burning with enthusiastic love of the principles on which American\r\nindependence was declared. The French government may not have admired\r\nthe American cause, but it hated England so intensely, that it was\r\nresolved to acknowledge the independence of America, and aid the\r\ncountry with its forces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrival of La Fayette.]\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the war, the American Congress had sent\r\ncommissioners to France, in order to obtain assistance. In consequence\r\nof their representations, La Fayette, then a young man of nineteen\r\nyears of age, freighted a ship at his own expense, and joined the\r\nAmerican standard. Congress, in consideration of his illustrious rank\r\nand singular enthusiasm, gave him a commission of major-general. And\r\ngloriously did he fulfil the great expectations which were formed of\r\nhim; richly did he deserve the gratitude and praise of all the friends\r\nof liberty.\r\n\r\nLa Fayette embarked in the American cause as a volunteer. The court of\r\nFrance, in the early period of the contest, did not think it expedient\r\nopenly to countenance the revolution. But, after the surrender of\r\nBurgoyne, and it was evident that the United States would succeed in\r\nsecuring their independence, then it was acknowledged, and substantial\r\naid was rendered.\r\n\r\nThe winter which succeeded the surrender of Burgoyne is memorable for\r\nthe sufferings of the American army encamped at Valley Forge, about\r\ntwenty miles from Philadelphia. The army was miserably supplied with\r\nprovisions and clothing, and strong discontent appeared in various\r\nquarters. Out of eleven thousand eight hundred men, nearly three\r\nthousand were barefooted and otherwise naked. But the sufferings\r\nof the army were not the only causes of solicitude to the\r\ncommander-in-chief, on whom chiefly rested the responsibility of the\r\nwar. The officers were discontented, and were not prepared, any more\r\nthan the privates, to make permanent sacrifices. They were obliged to\r\nbreak in upon their private property, and were without any prospect of\r\nfuture relief. Washington was willing to make any sacrifices himself,\r\nand refused any payment for his own expenses; but, while he exhibited\r\nthe rarest magnanimity, he did not expect it from others, and urged\r\nCongress to provide for the future pay of the officers, when the war\r\nshould close. He looked upon human nature as it was, not as he wished\r\nit to be, and recognized the principles of self-interest as well as\r\nthose of patriotism. It was his firm conviction that a long and\r\nlasting war could not, even in those times, be sustained by the\r\nprinciple of patriotism alone, but required, in addition, the prospect\r\nof interest, or some reward. The members of Congress did not all agree\r\nwith him in his views, and expected that officers would make greater\r\nsacrifices than private citizens, but, after a while, the plan of\r\nhalf-pay for life, as Washington proposed, was adopted by a small\r\nmajority, though afterwards changed to half-pay for seven years. There\r\nwas also a prejudice in many minds against a standing army, besides\r\nthe jealousies and antipathies which existed between different\r\nsections of the Union. But Washington, with his rare practical good\r\nsense, combated these, as well as the fears of the timid and the\r\nschemes of the selfish. The history of the Revolution impresses us\r\nwith the greatness and bravery of the American nation; and every\r\nAmerican should feel proud of his ancestors for the efforts they made,\r\nunder so many discouragements, to secure their liberties; but it would\r\nbe a mistake to suppose that nothing but exalted heroism was\r\nexhibited. Human nature showed its degeneracy in the camp and on the\r\nfield of battle, among heroes and among patriots. The perfection of\r\ncharacter, so far as man is ever perfect, was exhibited indeed, by\r\nWashington, but by Washington alone.\r\n\r\nThe army remained at Valley Forge till June, 1778. In the mean time,\r\nLord North made another ineffectual effort to procure reconciliation.\r\nBut he was too late. His offers might have been accepted at the\r\ncommencement of the contest; but nothing short of complete\r\nindependence would now satisfy the Americans, and this North was not\r\nwilling to concede. Accordingly, new measures of coercion were\r\nresorted to by the minister, although the British forces in America\r\nwere upwards of thirty-three thousand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evacuation of Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of June, Sir Henry Clinton, who had succeeded Sir William\r\nHowe in command of the British forces, evacuated Philadelphia, the\r\npossession of which had proved of no service to the English, except as\r\nwinter quarters for the troops. It was his object to proceed to New\r\nYork, for which place he marched with his army, having sent his heavy\r\nbaggage by water. The Americans, with superior forces, hung upon his\r\nrear, and sought an engagement. An indecisive one occurred at\r\nMonmouth, during which General Lee disregarded the orders of his\r\nsuperior in command, and was suspended for twelve months. There never\r\nwas perfect harmony between Washington and Lee; and the aid of the\r\nlatter, though a brave and experienced officer, was easily dispensed\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nNo action of importance occurred during this campaign, and it was\r\nchiefly signalized by the arrival of the Count d\'Estaing, with twelve\r\nships of the line and four frigates, to assist the Americans. But, in\r\nconsequence of disagreements and mistakes, this large armament failed\r\nto engage the English naval forces.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1779 was not more decisive than that of the preceding\r\nyear. Military operations were chiefly confined to the southern\r\nsections of the country, in which the English generally gained the\r\nadvantage, having superior forces. They overran the country, inflamed\r\nthe hostility of the Indians, and destroyed considerable property. But\r\nthey gained no important victory, and it was obvious to all parties\r\nthat conquest was impossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treason of Arnold.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1780 is memorable for the desertion of General Arnold.\r\nThough not attended by important political results, it produced an\r\nintense excitement. He was intrusted with the care of the fortress of\r\nWest Point, which commanded the Hudson River; but, dissatisfied,\r\nextravagant, and unprincipled, he thought to mend his broken fortunes\r\nby surrendering it to the British, who occupied New York. His treason\r\nwas discovered when his schemes were on the point of being\r\naccomplished; but he contrived to escape, and was made a\r\nbrigadier-general in the service of the enemy. Public execration\r\nloaded his name with ignominy, and posterity has not reversed the\r\nverdict of his indignant countrymen. His disgrace and ruin were\r\nprimarily caused by his extravagance and his mortified pride.\r\nWashington fully understood his want of moral principle, but continued\r\nto intrust him with power, in view of the great services he had\r\nrendered his country, and his unquestioned bravery and military\r\ntalents. After his defection, the American commander-in-chief was\r\nnever known to intrust an important office to a man in whose virtue he\r\nhad not implicit faith. The fate of Major Andr\xc3\xa9, who negotiated the\r\ntreason with Arnold, and who was taken as a spy, was much lamented by\r\nthe English Neither his family, nor rank, nor accomplishments, nor\r\nvirtues nor the intercession of Sir Henry Clinton, could save him from\r\nmilitary execution, according to the established laws of war.\r\nWashington has been blamed for not exercising more forbearance in the\r\ncase of so illustrious a prisoner; but the American general never\r\ndeparted from the rigid justice which he deemed it his duty to pursue.\r\n\r\nDuring this year, the American currency had singularly depreciated, so\r\nthat forty dollars were worth only one in specie--a fact which shows\r\nthe embarrassments of the country, and the difficulty of supporting\r\nthe army. But the prospects of ultimate success enabled Congress, at\r\nlength, to negotiate loans, and the army was kept together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.]\r\n\r\nThe great event in the campaign of 1781 was the surrender of Lord\r\nCornwallis, at Yorktown, which decided the fate of the war. Lord\r\nCornwallis, who was an able commander, had been successful at the\r\nsouth, although vigorously and skilfully opposed by General La\r\nFayette. But he had at last to contend with the main body of the\r\nAmerican army, and French forces in addition, so that the combined\r\narmies amounted to over twelve thousand men. He was compelled to\r\nsurrender to superior forces; and seven thousand prisoners, with all\r\ntheir baggage and stores, fell into the hands of the victors, 19th of\r\nOctober, 1781. This great event diffused universal joy throughout\r\nAmerica, and a corresponding depression among the English people.\r\n\r\nAfter this capitulation, the conviction was general that the war would\r\nsoon be terminated. General La Fayette obtained leave to return to\r\nFrance, and the recruiting service languished. The war nevertheless,\r\nwas continued until 1783; without, however, being signalized by any\r\ngreat events. On the 30th of November, 1782, preliminary articles of\r\npeace were signed at Paris, by which Great Britain acknowledged the\r\nindependence of the United States, and by which the whole country\r\nsouth of the lakes and east of the Mississippi was ceded to them, and\r\nthe right of fishing on the Banks of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of November, 1783, the British troops evacuated New York;\r\nand, shortly after, the American army was disbanded. The 4th of\r\nDecember, Washington made his farewell address to his officers; and,\r\non the 23d of December, he resigned his commission into the hands of\r\nthe body from which he received it, and retired to private life;\r\nhaving discharged the great trust reposed in him in a manner which\r\nsecured the gratitude of his country and which will probably win the\r\nplaudits of all future generations.\r\n\r\nThe results of the Revolutionary War can only be described by\r\nenumerating the progressive steps of American aggrandizement from that\r\ntime to this, and by speculating on the future destinies of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race on the American continent. The success which attended\r\nthis long war is in part to be traced to the talents and matchless\r\nwisdom and integrity of the commander-in-chief; to the intrepid\r\ncourage and virtues of the armies he directed; to the self-confidence\r\nand inexperience of the English generals; to the difficulties\r\nnecessarily attending the conquest of forests, and swamps, and\r\nscattered towns; to the assistance of the French nation; and, above\r\nall, to the superintending providence of God, who designed to rescue\r\nthe sons of the Pilgrims from foreign oppression, and, in spite of\r\ntheir many faults, to make them a great and glorious nation, in which\r\nreligious and civil liberty should be perpetuated, and all men left\r\nfree to pursue their own means of happiness, and develop the\r\ninexhaustible resources of a great and boundless empire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resignation of Lord North.]\r\n\r\nThe English nation acquiesced in an event which all felt to be\r\ninevitable; but Lord North was compelled to resign, and a change of\r\nmeasures was pursued. It is now time to contemplate English affairs,\r\nuntil the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--The books written on the American Revolution\r\n     are very numerous, an index to which may be seen in Botta\'s\r\n     History, as well as in the writings of those who have\r\n     treated of this great event. Sparks\'s Life and\r\n     Correspondence of Washington is doubtless the most valuable\r\n     work which has yet appeared since Marshall wrote the Life of\r\n     Washington. Guizot\'s Essay on Washington is exceedingly\r\n     able; nor do I know any author who has so profoundly\r\n     analyzed the character and greatness of the American hero.\r\n     Botta\'s History of the Revolution is a popular but\r\n     superficial and overlauded book. Mr. Hale\'s History of the\r\n     United States is admirably adapted to the purpose for which\r\n     it is designed, and is the best compendium of American\r\n     history.

The greatness of military\r\noperations, the magnitude of reforms, and the great number of\r\nillustrious statesmen and men of genius, make the period, when Pitt\r\nmanaged the helm of state, full of interest and grandeur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Life of Pitt.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Pitt, second son of the first Earl of Chatham, entered public\r\nlife at a very early age, and was prime minister of George\xc2\xa0III. at a\r\nperiod of life when most men are just completing a professional\r\neducation. He was a person of extraordinary precocity. He entered\r\nCambridge University at the age of fourteen, and at that period was a\r\nfinished Greek and Latin scholar. He spent no idle hours, and evinced\r\nbut little pleasure in the sports common to boys of his age. He was as\r\nsuccessful in mastering mathematics as the languages, and was an\r\nadmirer of the profoundest treatises of intellectual philosophy. He\r\nexcelled in every branch of knowledge to which he directed his\r\nattention. In 1780, at the age of twenty-one, he became a resident in\r\nLincoln\'s Inn, entered parliament the succeeding spring, and\r\nimmediately assumed an active part. His first speech astonished all\r\nwho heard him, notwithstanding that great expectations were formed\r\nconcerning his power. He was made chancellor of the exchequer at the\r\nage of twenty-three, and at a time when it required a finance minister\r\nof the greatest experience. Nor would the Commons have acquiesced in\r\nhis appointment to so important a post, in so critical a state of the\r\nnation, had not great confidence existed as to his abilities. From his\r\nfirst appearance, Pitt took a commanding position as a parliamentary\r\norator; nor, as such, has he ever, on the whole, been surpassed. His\r\npeculiar talents fitted him for the highest post in the gift of his\r\nsovereign, and the circumstances of the times, in addition, were such\r\nas were calculated to develop all the energies and talents he\r\npossessed. He was not the most commanding intellect of his age, but he\r\nwas, unquestionably, the greatest orator that England has produced,\r\nand exercised, to the close of his career, in spite of the opposition\r\nof such men as Burke, Fox, and Sheridan, an overwhelming parliamentary\r\ninfluence. He was a prodigy; as great in debate, and in executive\r\npower, as Napoleon was in the field, Bacon in philosophy, or\r\nShakspeare in poetry. It is difficult for us to conceive how a young\r\nman, just emerging from college halls, should be able to answer the\r\ndifficult questions of veteran statesmen who had been all their lives\r\nopposing the principles he advanced, and to assume at once the powers\r\nwith which his father was intrusted only at a mature period of life.\r\nPitt was almost beyond envy, and the proud nobles and princely\r\ncapitalists of the richest, proudest, and most conservative country in\r\nthe world, surrendered to him the guardianship of their liberties with\r\nno more fear or distrust than the hereditary bondmen of Turkey or\r\nRussia would have shown in hailing the accession of a new emperor. He\r\nwas born to command, one of nature\'s despots, and he assumed the reins\r\nof government with a perfect consciousness of his abilities to rule.\r\n\r\nHe was only twenty-four years of age when he began to reign; for, as\r\nprime minister of George\xc2\xa0III., he was, during his continuance in\r\noffice, the absolute ruler of the British empire. He had, virtually,\r\nthe nomination of his colleagues, and, through them, the direction of\r\nall executive affairs. He was controlled by the legislature only, and\r\nparliament was subservient to his will. What a proud position for a\r\nyoung man to occupy! A commoner, with a limited fortune, to give laws\r\nto a vast empire, and to have a proud nobility obedient to his will;\r\nand all this by the force of talents alone--talents which extorted\r\nadmiration and respect. He selected Lord Thurlow as chancellor, Lord\r\nGower as president of the council, the Duke of Richmond as lord privy\r\nseal, Lords Carmarthen and Sydney as secretaries of state, and Lord\r\nHowe as first lord of the admiralty. These were his chief associates\r\nin resisting a powerful opposition, and in regulating the affairs of a\r\nvast empire--the concerns of India, the national debt, the necessary\r\ntaxation, domestic tranquillity, and intercourse with foreign powers.\r\nBut he deserved the confidence of his sovereign and of the nation, and\r\nthey sustained him in his extraordinary embarrassments and\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Policy of Pitt.]\r\n\r\nThe policy of the administration is not here to be discussed; but it\r\nwas the one pursued, in the main, by his father, and one which\r\ngratified the national pride. The time has not yet come for us to\r\ndecide, with certainty, on the wisdom of his course. He was the\r\nadvocate of measures which had for their object national\r\naggrandizement. He was the strenuous defender of war, and he would\r\noppose Napoleon and all the world to secure pre\xc3\xabminence to Great\r\nBritain. He believed that glory was better than money; he thought that\r\nan overwhelming debt was a less evil than national disgrace; he\r\nexaggerated the resources and strength of his country, and believed\r\nthat it was destined to give laws to the world; he underrated the\r\nabilities of other nations to make great advances in mechanical skill\r\nand manufacturing enterprise; he supposed that English manufactures\r\nwould be purchased forever by the rest of the world, and therefore\r\nthat England, in spite of the debt, would make all nations contribute\r\nto her glory and wealth. It was to him a matter of indifference how\r\nheavily the people were taxed to pay the interest on a fictitious\r\ndebt, provided that, by their commerce and manufactures, they could\r\nfind abundant means to pay this interest. And so long as England could\r\nfind a market for her wares, the nation would not suffer from\r\ntaxation. His error was in supposing that England, forever, would\r\nmanufacture for the world; that English skill was superior to the\r\nskill of all other nations; that there was a superiority in the very\r\nnature of an Englishman which would enable him, in any country, or\r\nunder any circumstances, to overcome all competitors and rivals. Such\r\nviews were grateful to his nation; and he, by continually flattering\r\nthe national vanity, and ringing the changes on glory and patriotism,\r\ninduced it to follow courses which may one day result in overwhelming\r\ncalamities. Self-exaggeration is as fatal to a nation as it is to an\r\nindividual, and constitutes that pride which precedes destruction. But\r\nthe mere debt of England, being owed to herself, and not to another\r\nnation, is not so alarming as it is sometimes supposed. The worst\r\nconsequence, in a commercial point of view, is national bankruptcy;\r\nbut if England becomes bankrupt, her factories, her palaces, her\r\nwarehouses, and her ships remain. These are not destroyed. Substantial\r\nwealth does not fly from the island, but merely passes from the hands\r\nof capitalists to the people. The policy of Pitt has merely enriched\r\nthe few at the expense of the many--has confirmed the power of the\r\naristocracy. When manufacturers can no longer compete with those of\r\nother countries, upon such unequal terms as are rendered necessary in\r\nconsequence of unparalleled taxation to support the public creditors,\r\nthen the public creditors must suffer rather than the manufacturer\r\nhimself. The manufacturer must live. This class composes a great part\r\nof the nation. The people must be fed, and they will be fed; and they\r\ncan be fed as cheaply as in any country, were it not for taxes. The\r\npolicy of Pitt, during the period of commercial prosperity, tended,\r\nindeed, to strengthen the power of the aristocracy--that class to\r\nwhich he belonged, and to which the House of Commons, who sustained\r\nhim, belonged. But it was suicidal, as is the policy of all selfish\r\nmen; and ultimately must tend to revolutionary measures, even though\r\nthose measures may not be carried by massacres and blazing thrones.\r\n\r\nBut we must hasten to consider the leading events which characterized\r\nthe administration of William Pitt. These were the troubles in\r\nIreland, parliamentary reforms, the aggrandizement of the East India\r\nCompany, the trial of Hastings, debates on the slave trade, and the\r\nwar with France in consequence of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulties with Ireland.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The United Irishmen.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulties with Ireland did not become alarming until the French\r\nRevolution had created a spirit of discontent and agitation in all\r\nparts of Great Britain. Soon after his accession to power, Mr. Flood,\r\na distinguished member of the Irish House of Commons, brought in a\r\nbill of parliamentary reform, which, after a long debate, was\r\nnegatived. Though his measure was defeated in the House, its advocates\r\nout of doors were not cast down, but took measures to form a national\r\ncongress, for the amelioration of the evils which existed. A large\r\ndelegation of the people actually met at Dublin, and petitioned\r\nparliament for the redress of grievances. Mr. Pitt considered the\r\nmatter with proper attention, and labored to free the commerce of\r\nIreland from the restraints under which it labored. But, in so doing,\r\nhe excited the jealousy of British merchants and manufacturers, and\r\nthey induced him to remodel his propositions for the relief of\r\nIreland, which were then adopted. Tranquillity was restored until the\r\nyear 1791, when there appeared at Belfast the plan of an association,\r\nunder the name of the _United Irishmen_, whose object was a radical\r\nreform of all the evils which had existed in Ireland since its\r\nconnection with England. This association soon extended throughout the\r\nisland, and numbered an immense body of both Protestants and Catholics\r\nwho were disaffected with the government. In consequence of the\r\ndisaffections, especially among the Catholics, the English ministry\r\nmade many concessions, and the legislature allowed Catholics to\r\npractice law, to intermarry with Protestants, and to obtain an\r\nunrestrained education. But parliament also took measures to prevent\r\nthe assembling of any convention of the people, and augmented the\r\nmilitia in case of disturbance. But disturbances took place, and the\r\nUnited Irishmen began to contemplate an entire separation from\r\nEngland, and other treasonable designs. In consequence of these\r\ncommotions, the Habeas Corpus Act was suspended, and a military\r\ngovernment was enforced with all its rigor. The United Irish pretended\r\nto submit, but laid still deeper schemes, and extended their\r\naffiliations. In May, 1797, the number of men enrolled by the union in\r\nUlster alone was one hundred thousand, and their organization was\r\nperfect. The French government was aware of the union, which gradually\r\nnumbered five hundred thousand men, and promised it assistance. The\r\nIrish, however, relied chiefly upon themselves, and prepared to resist\r\nthe English government, which was resolved on pursuing the most\r\nvigorous measures. A large military force was sent to Ireland, and\r\nseveral ringleaders of the contemplated insurrection were arrested.\r\n\r\nBut the timely discovery of the conspiracy prevented one of the most\r\nbloody contests which ever happened in Ireland. Nevertheless, the\r\ninsurrection broke out in some places, and in the county of Wexford\r\nwas really formidable. The rebels numbered twenty thousand men. They\r\ngot possession of Wexford, and committed great barbarities; but they\r\nwere finally subdued by Lord Cornwallis. Had the French co\xc3\xb6perated, as\r\nthey had promised, with a force of fifteen thousand, it is not\r\nimprobable that Ireland would have been wrested from England. But the\r\nFrench had as much as they could do, at this time, to take care of\r\nthemselves; and Ireland was again subjected to greater oppressions\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nThe Irish parliament had hitherto been a mere body of perpetual\r\ndictators. By the Octennial Bill, this oligarchy was disbanded, and\r\nthe House of Commons wore something of the appearance of a\r\nconstitutional assembly, and there were found in it some men of\r\nintegrity and sagacity. Ireland also had her advocates in the British\r\nsenate; but whenever the people or the parliament gained a victory\r\nover the viceroy, some accident or blunder deprived the nation of\r\nreaping the fruits. The Commons became again corrupted, and the\r\nindependence which Ireland obtained ceased to have a value. The\r\ncorrupted Commons basely surrendered all that had been obtained. In\r\nvain the eloquence of Curran and Grattan. The Irish nation, without\r\npublic virtue, a prey to faction, and a scene of corruption, became at\r\nlast powerless and politically helpless. The rebellion of 1798 was a\r\nmere peasants\' war, without intelligence to guide, or experience to\r\ncounsel. It therefore miserably failed, but did not fail until fifty\r\nthousand rebels and twenty thousand royalists had perished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Union of England and Ireland.]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1800, the union of Ireland and England was effected, on the\r\nsame basis as that between England and Scotland in the time of Anne.\r\nIt was warmly opposed by some of the more patriotic of the Irish\r\nstatesmen, and only carried by corruption and bribery. By this union,\r\nforeign legislation took the place of the guidance of those best\r\nqualified to know the national grievances; the Irish members became,\r\nin the British senate, merely the tools of the administration.\r\nAbsenteeism was nearly doubled, and the national importance nearly\r\nannihilated in a political point of view. But, on the other hand, an\r\noligarchal tyranny was broken, and the bond of union which bound the\r\ncountries was strengthened, and the nation subsided into a greater\r\nstate of tranquillity. Twenty-eight peers and one hundred commoners\r\nwere admitted into the English parliament.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the suppression of the rebellion of 1798, only five\r\nyears elapsed before another one was contemplated--the result of\r\nrepublican principles, and of national grievances. The leaders were\r\nRobert Emmet and Thomas Russell. But their treasonable designs were\r\nmiserably supported by their countrymen, and they were able to make\r\nbut a feeble effort, which immediately failed. These men were\r\narrested, tried, and executed. The speech of Emmet, before his\r\nexecution, has been much admired for its spirit of patriotism and\r\npensive eloquence. His grand mistake consisted in overrating the\r\nstrength of democratic influences, and in supposing that, by violent\r\nmeasures, he could overturn a strong military government. The Irish\r\nwere not prepared for freedom, still less republican freedom. There\r\nwas not sufficient concert, or patriotism, or intelligence, to secure\r\npopular liberty, and the antipathy between the Catholic and Protestant\r\npopulation was too deeply seated and too malignant to hope,\r\nreasonably, for a lasting union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condition of Ireland.]\r\n\r\nAll the measures which have been adopted for the independence and\r\nelevation of Ireland have failed, and the country is still in as\r\nlamentable a state as ever. It presents a grand enigma and mystery to\r\nthe politician. All the skill of statesmen is baffled in devising\r\nmeans for the tranquillity and improvement of that unhappy and\r\nunfortunate country. The more privileges the people gain, and the\r\ngreater assistance they receive, the more unreasonable appear to be\r\ntheir demands, and the more extravagant their expectations. Still,\r\nthere are great and shameful evils, which ought to be remedied. There\r\nare nearly five millions of acres of waste land in the country,\r\ncapable of the highest cultivation. The soil is inexhaustibly rich,\r\nthe climate is most delightful, and the natural advantages for\r\nagriculture and commerce unprecedented. Still the Irish remain\r\noppressed and poor; enslaved by their priests, and ground down to the\r\nearth by exacting landlords and a hostile government. There is no real\r\nunion between England and Ireland, no sympathy between the different\r\nclasses, and an implacable animosity between the Protestant and\r\nCatholic population. The northern and Protestant part of the island is\r\nthe most flourishing; but Ireland, in any light it may be viewed, is\r\nthe most miserable country, with all the gifts of nature, the worst\r\ngoverned, and the most afflicted, in Christendom; and no human\r\nsagacity or wisdom has yet been able to devise a remedy for the\r\ninnumerable evils which prevail. The permanent causes of the\r\ndegradation of the Irish peasantry, in their own country, have been\r\nvariously attributed to the Roman Catholic priesthood, to the tyranny\r\nof the government, to the system by which the lands are leased and\r\ncultivated, and to the natural elements of the Irish character. These,\r\nunited, may have produced the effects which all philanthropists\r\ndeplore; but no one cause, in particular, can account for so fine a\r\nnation sinking into such poverty and wretchedness, especially when it\r\nis considered that the same idle and miserable peasantry, when\r\ntransplanted to America, exhibit very different dispositions and\r\ntastes, and develop traits of character which command respect and\r\nsecure prosperity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliamentary Reform.]\r\n\r\nThe first plan for parliamentary reform was brought forward by Pitt in\r\n1782, before he was prime minister, in consequence of a large number\r\nof the House representing no important interests, and dependent on the\r\nminister. But his motion was successfully opposed. In May, 1783, he\r\nbrought in another bill to add one hundred members to the House of\r\nCommons, and to abolish a proportionate number of the small and\r\nobnoxious boroughs. This plan, though supported by Fox, was negatived\r\nby a great majority. In 1785, he made a third attempt to secure a\r\nreform of parliament, and again failed; and with this last attempt\r\nended all his efforts for this object. So persuaded was he of the\r\nimpracticability of the measure, that he even uniformly opposed the\r\nobject when attempted by others. Moreover, he changed his opinions\r\nwhen he perceived the full connection and bearing of the subject with\r\nother agitating questions. He was desirous of a reform, if it could be\r\nobtained without mischief; but when it became a democratic measure, he\r\nopposed it with all his might. Indeed, he avowed that he preferred to\r\nhave parliament remain as it was, forever, rather than risk any\r\nprospects of reform when the country was so deeply agitated by\r\nrevolutionary discussions. Mr. Pitt perfectly understood that those\r\npersons who were most eager for parliamentary reform, desired the\r\noverthrow of the existing institutions of the land, or, at least, such\r\nas were inconsistent with the hereditary succession to the throne,\r\nhereditary titles, and the whole system of entailed estates. Mr. Pitt,\r\nas he grew older, more powerful, and more experienced, became more\r\naristocratic and conservative; feared to touch any of the old supports\r\nof the constitution for fear of producing a revolution--an evil which,\r\nof all evils, he most abhorred. Mr. Burke, though opposed to the\r\nminister, here defended him, and made an eloquent speech against\r\nrevolutionary measures. Nor can we wonder at the change of opinion,\r\nwhich Mr. Pitt and others admitted, when it is considered that the\r\nadvocates of parliamentary reform also were associated with men of\r\ninfidel and dangerous principles. Thomas Paine was one of the apostles\r\nof liberty in that age, and his writings had a very great and very\r\npernicious influence on the people at large. It is very singular, but\r\nnevertheless true, that some of the most useful reforms have been\r\nprojected by men of infidel principles, and infidelity and\r\nrevolutionary excess have generally been closely connected.\r\n\r\nBut the reform question did not deeply agitate the people of England\r\nuntil a much later period. One of the most exciting events, in the\r\ndomestic history of England during the administration of Pitt, was the\r\ntrial of Hastings and the difficulties which grew out of the\r\naggrandizement of the East India Company.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Warren Hastings.]\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on colonization, allusion was made to Indian affairs\r\nuntil the close of the administration of Lord Clive. Warren Hastings\r\ncontinued the encroachments and conquests which Clive had so\r\nsuccessfully begun. He went to India in 1750, at the age of seventeen,\r\nas a clerk in the service of the company. It was then merely a\r\ncommercial corporation. His talents and sagacity insured his\r\nprosperity. He gradually was promoted, and, in 1772, was appointed\r\nhead of the government in Bengal. But the governor was not then, as he\r\nnow is, nearly absolute, and he had only one vote in the council which\r\nrepresented the company at Calcutta. He was therefore frequently\r\noverruled, and his power was crippled. But he contrived to make\r\nimportant changes, and abolished the office of the minister to whom\r\nwas delegated the collection of the revenue and the general regulation\r\nof internal affairs--an office which had been always held by a native.\r\nHastings transferred the internal administration to the servants of\r\nthe company, and in various other ways improved the finances of the\r\ncompany, the members of which were indifferent, comparatively, to the\r\ncondition of the people of India, provided that they themselves were\r\nenriched. To enrich the company and extend its possessions, even at\r\nthe expense of justice and humanity, became the object of the\r\ngovernor-general. He succeeded; but success brought upon him the\r\nimprecations of the natives and the indignant rebukes of his own\r\ncountrymen. In less than two years after he had assumed the\r\ngovernment, he added four hundred thousand pounds to the annual income\r\nof the company, besides nearly a million in ready money. But the\r\nadministration of Hastings cannot be detailed. We can only notice that\r\npart of it which led to his trial in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War with Hyder Ali.]\r\n\r\nThe great event which marked his government was the war with Hyder\r\nAli, the Mohammedan sovereign of Mysore. The province of Bengal and\r\nthe Carnatic had been, for some time, under the protection of the\r\nEnglish. Adjoining the Carnatic, in the centre of the peninsula, were\r\nthe dominions of Hyder Ali. Had Hastings been governor of Madras, he\r\nwould have conciliated him, or vigorously encountered him as an enemy.\r\nBut the authorities at Madras had done neither. They provoked him to\r\nhostilities, and, with an army of ninety thousand men, he invaded the\r\nCarnatic. British India was on the verge of ruin. Hyder Ali was every\r\nwhere triumphant, and only a few fortified places remained to the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nHastings, when he heard of the calamity, instantly adopted the most\r\nvigorous measures. He settled his difficulties with the Mahrattas; he\r\nsuspended the incapable governor of Fort George, and sent Sir Eyre\r\nCoote to oppose the great Mohammedan prince who threatened to subvert\r\nthe English power in India.\r\n\r\nBut Hastings had not the money which was necessary to carry on an\r\nexpensive war with the most formidable enemy the English ever\r\nencountered in the East. He therefore resolved to plunder the richest\r\nand most sacred city of India--Benares. It was the seat of Indian\r\nlearning and devotion, and contained five hundred thousand people. Its\r\ntemple, as seen from the Ganges, was the most imposing in the Eastern\r\nworld, while its bazaars were filled with the most valuable and rare\r\nof Indian commodities; with the muslins of Bengal, the shawls of\r\nCashmere, the sabres of Oude, and the silks of its own looms.\r\n\r\nThis rich capital was governed by a prince nominally subject to the\r\nGreat Mogul, but who was dependent on the Nabob of Oude, a large\r\nprovince north of the Ganges, near the Himmaleh Mountains. Benares and\r\nits territories, being oppressed by the Nabob of Oude, sought the\r\nprotection of the British. Their protection was, of course, readily\r\nextended; but it was fatal to the independence of Benares. The\r\nalliance with the English was like the protection Rome extended to\r\nGreece when threatened by Asia, and which ended in the subjection of\r\nboth Greece and Asia. The Rajah of Benares became the vassal of the\r\ncompany, and therefore was obliged to furnish money for the protection\r\nhe enjoyed.\r\n\r\nBut the tribute which the Rajah of Benares paid did not satisfy\r\nHastings. He exacted still greater sums, which led to an insurrection\r\nand ultimate conquest. The fair domains of Cheyte Sing, the lord of\r\nBenares, were added to the dominions of the company together with an\r\nincreased revenue of two hundred thousand pounds a year. The treasure\r\nof the rajah amounted to two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and\r\nthis was divided as prize money among the English.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Robbery of the Princesses of Oude.]\r\n\r\nThe rapacious governor-general did not obtain the treasure which he\r\nexpected to find at Benares, and then resolved to rob the Princesses\r\nof Oude, who had been left with immense treasures on the death of\r\nSuraj-w Dowlah, the nabob vizier of the Grand Mogul. The only pretext\r\nwhich Hastings could find was, that the insurrection at Benares had\r\nproduced disturbances at Oude, and which disturbances were imputed to\r\nthe princesses. Great barbarities were inflicted in order to secure\r\nthese treasures; but the robbers were successful, and immense sums\r\nflowed into the treasury of the company. By these iniquities, the\r\ngovernor found means to conduct the war in the Carnatic successfully,\r\nand a treaty was concluded with Tippoo, the son of Hyder Ali, by which\r\nthe company reigned without a rival on the great Indian peninsula.\r\n\r\nWhen peace was restored to India, and the company\'s servants had\r\naccumulated immense fortunes, Hastings returned to England. But the\r\niniquities he had practised excited great indignation among those\r\nstatesmen who regarded justice and humanity as better supports to a\r\ngovernment than violence and rapine.\r\n\r\nForemost among these patriots was Edmund Burke. He had long been a\r\nmember of the select committee to investigate Indian affairs, and he\r\nhad bestowed great attention to them, and fully understood the course\r\nwhich Hastings had pursued.\r\n\r\nThrough his influence, an inquiry into the conduct of the late\r\ngovernor-general was instituted, and he was accordingly impeached at\r\nthe bar of the House of Lords. Mr. Pitt permitted matters to take\r\ntheir natural course; but the king, the Lord Chancellor Thurlow, the\r\nministers generally, and the directors of the East India Company\r\nespoused his cause. They regarded him as a very great man, whose rule\r\nhad been glorious to the nation, in spite of the mistakes and\r\ncruelties which marked his government. He had added an empire to the\r\nBritish crown, educed order out of anarchy, and organized a system of\r\nadministration which, in its essential features, has remained to this\r\ntime. He enriched the company, while he did not enrich himself; for he\r\neasily might have accumulated a fortune of three millions of pounds.\r\nAnd he moreover contrived, in spite of his extortions and conquests,\r\nto secure the respect of the native population, whose national and\r\nreligious prejudices he endeavored not to shock. "These things\r\ninspired good will. At the same time, his constant success, and the\r\nmanner in which he extricated himself from every difficulty, made him\r\nan object of superstitious admiration; and the more than regal\r\nsplendor which he sometimes displayed, dazzled a people who have much\r\nin common with children. Even now, after the lapse of more than fifty\r\nyears, the natives of India still talk of him as the greatest of the\r\nEnglish, and nurses sing children to sleep with a gingling ballad\r\nabout the fleet horses and richly-caparisoned elephants of Sahib\r\nWarren Hostein."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prosecution of Hastings.]\r\n\r\nBut neither the admiration of the people of the East for the splendid\r\nabilities of Hastings, nor the gratitude of a company of merchants,\r\nnor the powerful friends he had in the English parliament, could\r\nscreen him from the malignant hatred of Francis, or the purer\r\nindignation of Burke. The zeal which the latter evinced in his\r\nprosecution has never been equalled, and all his energies, for years,\r\nwere devoted to the exposure of a person whom he regarded as "a\r\ndelinquent of the first magnitude." "He had just as lively an idea of\r\nthe insurrection at Benares as of Lord George Gordon\'s riots, and of\r\nthe execution of Nuncomar as of the execution of Dr. Dodd." Burke was\r\nassisted in his vehement prosecution by Charles James Fox, the\r\ngreatest debater ever known in the House of Commons, but a man vastly\r\ninferior to himself in moral elevation, in general knowledge, in power\r\nof fancy, and in profound wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe trial was at Westminster Hall, the hall which had witnessed the\r\ninauguration of thirty kings, and the trials of accused nobles since\r\nthe time of William Rufus. And he was a culprit not unworthy of that\r\ngreat tribunal before which he was summoned--"a tribunal which had\r\npronounced sentence on Strafford, and pardon on Somers"--the tribunal\r\nbefore which royalty itself had been called to account. Hastings had\r\nruled, with absolute sway, a country which was more populous and more\r\nextensive than any of the kingdoms of Europe, and had gained a fame\r\nwhich was bounded only by the unknown countries of the globe. He was\r\ndefended by three men who subsequently became the three highest judges\r\nof the land, and he was encouraged by the appearance and sympathetic\r\nsmiles of the highest nobles of the realm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edmund Burke.]\r\n\r\nBut greater than all were the mighty statesmen who conducted the\r\nprosecution. First among them in character and genius was Edmund\r\nBurke, who, from the time that he first spoke in the House of Commons,\r\nin 1766, had been a prominent member, and had, at length, secured\r\ngreater fame than any of his contemporaries, Pitt alone excepted, not\r\nmerely as an orator, but as an enlightened statesman, a philosopher,\r\nand a philanthropist. He excelled all the great men with whom he was\r\nassociated, in the variety of his powers; he was a poet even while a\r\nboy; a penetrating philosopher, critic, and historian before the age\r\nof thirty; a statesman of unrivalled moral wisdom; an orator whose\r\nspeeches have been read with increasing admiration in every succeeding\r\nage; a judge of the fine arts to whose opinions Reynolds submitted;\r\nand a writer on various subjects, in which he displayed not only vast\r\nknowledge, but which he treated in a style of matchless beauty and\r\nforce. All the great men of his age--Johnson, Reynolds, Goldsmith,\r\nGarrick, Pitt, Fox, Sheridan, Windham, North, Thurlow, Parr--scholars,\r\ncritics, divines, and statesmen--bore testimony to his commanding\r\ngenius and his singular moral worth, to his hatred of vice, and his\r\npassionate love of virtue. But these great and varied excellences,\r\nwhich secured him the veneration of the finest minds in Europe, were\r\nnot fully appreciated by his own nation, which was astonished rather\r\nthan governed by his prophetic wisdom. But Burke was remarkable, not\r\nmerely for his knowledge, eloquence, and genius but also for an\r\nunblemished private life, for the habitual exercise of all those\r\nvirtues, and the free expression of all those noble sentiments which\r\nonly have marked exalted Christian characters. In his political\r\nprinciples, he was a conservative, and preferred to base his views on\r\nhistory and experience, rather than to try experiments, especially\r\nwhen these were advocated by men whose moral character or infidel\r\nsentiments excited his distrust or aversion. He did not shut his eyes\r\nto abuse, but aimed to mend deliberately and cautiously. His\r\nadmonition to his country respecting America corresponded with his\r\ngeneral sentiments. "Talk not of your abstract rights of government; I\r\nhate the very sound of them; follow experience and common sense." He\r\nbelieved that love was better than force, and that the strength of any\r\ngovernment consisted in the affections of the people. And these he\r\never strove to retain, and for these he was willing to relinquish\r\nmomentary gain and selfish aggrandizement. He advocated concession to\r\nthe Irish legislature; justice and security to the people of India;\r\nliberty of conscience to Dissenters; relief to small debtors; the\r\nsuppression of general warrants; the extension of the power of juries;\r\nfreedom of the press; retrenchment in the public expenditures; the\r\nremoval of commercial restrictions; and the abolition of the slave\r\ntrade. He had a great contempt for "mechanical politicians," and\r\n"pedler principles." And he lived long enough to see the fulfilment of\r\nhis political prophecies, and the horrors of that dreadful revolution\r\nwhich he had predicted and disliked, not because the principles which\r\nthe French apostles of liberty advocated, were not abstractedly true,\r\nbut because they were connected with excesses, and an infidel\r\nrecklessness in the violation of established social rights, which\r\nalarmed and disgusted him. He died in 1797, in the sixty-eighth year\r\nof his age, beloved and honored by the good and great in all Christian\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles James Fox.]\r\n\r\nNext to Burke, among the prosecutors of Hastings, for greatness and\r\npopularity, was Charles James Fox; inferior to Burke in knowledge,\r\nimagination, and moral power, but superior in all the arts of debate,\r\nthe most logical and accomplished forensic orator which that age of\r\norators produced. His father, Lord Holland, had been the rival of the\r\ngreat Chatham, and he himself was opposed, nearly the whole of his\r\npublic life, to the younger Pitt. His political principles were like\r\nthose of Burke until the French Revolution, whose principles he at\r\nfirst admired. He was emphatically the man of the people, easy of\r\naccess, social in his habits, free in his intercourse, without reserve\r\nor haughtiness, generous, magnanimous, and conciliatory. He was\r\nunsurpassed for logical acuteness, and for bursts of overpowering\r\npassion. He reached high political station, although his habits were\r\nsuch as destroyed, in many respects, the respect of those great men\r\nwith whom he was associated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Richard Brinsley Sheridan.]\r\n\r\nRichard Brinsley Sheridan, another of the public accusers of Hastings,\r\nwas a different man from either Burke or Fox. He was born in Ireland,\r\nbut was educated at Harrow, and first distinguished himself by writing\r\nplays. In 1776, on the retirement of Garrick, he became manager of\r\nDrury Lane Theatre; and shortly after appeared the School for Scandal,\r\nwhich placed him on the summit of dramatic fame. In 1780, he entered\r\nparliament, and, when Hastings was impeached, was in the height of his\r\nreputation, both as a writer and orator. His power consisted in\r\nbrilliant declamation and sparkling wit, and his speech in relation to\r\nthe Princesses of Oude produced an impression almost without a\r\nparallel in ancient or modern times. Mr. Burke\'s admiration was\r\nsincere and unbounded, but Fox thought it too florid and rhetorical.\r\nHis fame now rests on his dramas. But his life was the shipwreck of\r\ngenius, in consequence of his extravagance, his recklessness in\r\nincurring debts, and his dissipated habits, which disorganized his\r\nmoral character and undermined the friendships which his brilliant\r\ntalents at first secured to him.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the indignation which these illustrious orators\r\nexcited against Hastings, he was nevertheless acquitted, after a trial\r\nwhich lasted eight years, in consequence of the change of public\r\nopinion; and, above all, in view of the great services which he had\r\nreally rendered to his country. The expenses of the trial nearly\r\nruined him; but the East India Company granted him an annual income of\r\nfour thousand pounds, which he spent in ornamenting and enriching\r\nDaylesford, the seat which had once belonged to his family, and which\r\nhe purchased after his return from India.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bill for the Regulation of India.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Warren Hastings was eventually acquitted by the House of\r\nLords, still his long and protracted trial brought to light many evils\r\nconnected with the government of India; and, in 1784, acts were passed\r\nwhich gave the nation a more direct control over the East India\r\nCompany--the most gigantic monopoly the world has ever seen. That a\r\ncompany of merchants in Leadenhall Street should exercise an unlimited\r\npower over an empire larger than the whole of Europe with the\r\nexception of Russia, and sacrifice the interests of humanity to base\r\npecuniary considerations, at length aroused the English nation.\r\nAccordingly, Mr. Pitt brought in a bill, which passed both Houses,\r\nwhich provided that the affairs of the company should be partly\r\nmanaged by a Board of Control, partly by the Court of Directors, and\r\npartly by a general meeting of the stockholders of the company. The\r\nBoard of Control was intrusted to five privy counsellors, one of whom\r\nwas secretary of state. It was afterwards composed of a president,\r\nsuch members of the privy council as the king should select, and a\r\nsecretary. This board superintends and regulates all civil, military,\r\nand revenue officers, and political negotiations, and all general\r\ndespatches. The Board of Directors, composed of twenty-four men, six\r\nof whom are annually elected, has the nomination of the\r\ngovernor-general, and the appointment of all civil and military\r\nofficers. These two boards operate as a check against each other.\r\n\r\nThe first governor-general, by the new constitution, was Lord\r\nCornwallis, a nobleman of great military experience and elevated moral\r\nworth; a man who was intrusted with great power, even after his\r\nmisfortunes in America, and a man who richly deserved the confidence\r\nreposed in him. Still, he was seldom fortunate. He made blunders in\r\nIndia as well as in America. He did not fully understand the\r\ninstitutions of India, or the genius of the people. He was soon called\r\nto embark in the contests which divided the different native princes,\r\nand with the usual result. The simple principle of English territorial\r\nacquisition is, in defending the cause of the feebler party. The\r\nstronger party was then conquered, and became a province of the East\r\nIndia Company, while the weaker remained under English protection,\r\nuntil, by oppression, injustice, and rapacity on the part of the\r\nprotectors, it was driven to rebellion, and then subdued.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Cornwallis was sent to India, in 1786, the East India\r\nCompany had obtained possession of Bengal, a part of Bahar, the\r\nBenares district of Allahabad, part of Orissa, the Circars, Bombay,\r\nand the Jaghire of the Carnatic--a district of one hundred miles along\r\nthe coast. The other great Indian powers, unconquered by the English,\r\nwere the Mahrattas, who occupied the centre of India, from Delhi to\r\nthe Krishna, and from the Bay of Bengal to the Arabian Sea; also,\r\nGolconda, the western parts of the Carnatic, Mysore, Oude, and the\r\ncountry of the Sikhs. Of the potentates who ruled over these extensive\r\nprovinces, the Sultan of Mysore, Tippoo Saib, was the most powerful,\r\nalthough the Mahrattas country was the largest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War with Tippoo Saib.]\r\n\r\nThe hostility of Tippoo, who inherited his father\'s prejudices against\r\nthe English, excited the suspicions of Lord Cornwallis, and a\r\ndesperate war was the result, in which the sultan showed the most\r\ndaring courage. In 1792, the English general invested the formidable\r\nfortress of Seringapatam, with sixteen thousand Europeans and thirty\r\nthousand sepoys, and with the usual success. Tippoo, after the loss of\r\nthis strong fort, and of twenty-three thousand of his troops, made\r\npeace with Lord Cornwallis, by the payment of four millions of pounds,\r\nand the surrender of half his dominions. Lord Cornwallis, after the\r\nclose of this war, returned home, and was succeeded by Sir John Shore;\r\nand he by Marquis Wellesley, (1798,) under whose administration the\r\nwar with Tippoo was renewed, in consequence of the intrigues of the\r\nsultan with the French at Pondicherry, to regain his dominions. The\r\nSultan of Mysore, was again defeated, and slain; the dynasty of Hyder\r\nAli ceased to reign, and the East India Company took possession of the\r\nwhole southern peninsula. A subsequent war with the Mahratta powers\r\ncompletely established the British supremacy in India. Delhi, the\r\ncapital of the Great Mogul, fell into the hands of the English, and\r\nthe emperor himself became a stipendiary of a company of merchants.\r\nThe conquest of the country of the Mahrattas was indeed successful,\r\nbut was attended by vast expenses, which entailed a debt on the\r\ncompany of about nineteen millions of pounds. The brilliant successes\r\nof Wellesley, however, were not appreciated by the Board of Directors,\r\nwho wanted dividends rather than glory, and he was recalled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conquest of India.]\r\n\r\nThere were no new conquests until 1817, under the government of the\r\nEarl of Moira, afterwards Marquis of Hastings. He made war on the\r\nPindarries, who were bands of freebooters in Central India. They were\r\nassisted by several native powers, which induced the governor-general\r\nto demand considerable cessions of territory. In 1819, the British\r\neffected a settlement at Singapore by which a lucrative commerce was\r\nsecured to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nLord Hastings was succeeded by the Earl of Amherst, under whose\r\nadministration the Burmese war commenced, and by which large\r\nterritories, between Bengal and China, were added to the British\r\nempire, (1826.)\r\n\r\nOn the overthrow of the Mogul empire, the kingdom of the Sikhs, in the\r\nnorthern part of India, and that of the Affghans, lying west of the\r\nIndus, arose in importance--kingdoms formerly subject to Persia. The\r\nformer, with all its dependent provinces, has recently been conquered,\r\nand annexed to the overgrown dominions of the Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, the charter of the East India Company expired, and a total\r\nchange of system was the result. The company was deprived of its\r\nexclusive right of trade, the commerce with India and China was freely\r\nopened to all the world, and the possessions and rights of the company\r\nwere ceded to the nation for an annual annuity of six hundred and\r\nthirty thousand pounds. The political government of India, however,\r\nwas continued to the company until 1853.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consequences of the Conquest.]\r\n\r\nThus has England come in possession of one of the oldest and most\r\npowerful of the Oriental empires, containing a population of one\r\nhundred and thirty millions of people, speaking various languages, and\r\nwedded irrecoverably to different social and religious institutions.\r\nThe conquest of India is complete, and there is not a valuable office\r\nin the whole country which is not held by an Englishman. The native\r\nand hereditary princes of provinces, separately larger and more\r\npopulous than Great Britain itself, are divested of all but the shadow\r\nof power, and receive stipends from the East India Company. The\r\nEmperor of Delhi, the Nabobs of Bengal and the Carnatic, the Rajahs of\r\nTanjore and Benares, and the Princes of the house of Tippoo, and other\r\nprinces, receive, indeed, an annual support of over a million\r\nsterling; but their power has passed away. An empire two thousand\r\nmiles from east to west, and eighteen hundred from north to south, and\r\ncontaining more square miles than a territory larger than all the\r\nStates between the Mississippi and the Atlantic Ocean, has fallen into\r\nthe hands of the Anglo-Saxon race. It is true that a considerable part\r\nof Hindostan is nominally held by subsidiary allies, under the\r\nprotection of the British government; but the moment that these\r\ndependent princes cease to be useful, this protection will be\r\nwithdrawn. There can be no reasonable doubt that the English rule is\r\nbeneficent in many important respects. Order and law are better\r\nobserved than formerly under the Mohammedan dynasty; but no\r\ncompensation is sufficient, in the eyes of the venerable Brahmin, for\r\ninterference in the laws and religion of the country. India has been\r\nrobbed by the armies of European merchants, and is only held in\r\nbondage by an overwhelming military force, which must be felt as\r\nburdensome and expensive when the plundered country shall no longer\r\nsatisfy the avarice of commercial corporations. But that day may be\r\nremote. Calcutta now rivals in splendor and importance the old capital\r\nof the Great Mogul. The palace of the governor-general is larger than\r\nWindsor Castle or Buckingham Palace; the stupendous fortifications of\r\nFort William rival the fortress of Gibraltar; the Anglo-Indian army\r\namounts to two hundred thousand men; while the provinces of India are\r\ntaxed, directly or indirectly, to an amount exceeding eighteen\r\nmillions of pounds per annum. It is idle to speculate on the destinies\r\nof India, or the duration of the English power. The future is ever\r\nfull of gloom, when scarcely any thing is noticeable but injustice and\r\noppression on the part of rulers, and poverty and degradation among\r\nthe governed. It is too much to suppose that one hundred and eighty\r\nmillions of the human race can be permanently governed by a power on\r\nthe opposite side of the globe, and where there never can exist any\r\nunion or sympathy between the nation that rules and the nations that\r\nare ruled, in any religious, social, or political institution; and\r\nwhen all that is dear to the heart of man, and all that is consecrated\r\nby the traditions of ages, are made to subserve the interests of a\r\nmercantile state.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to hasten to the consideration of the remaining\r\nsubjects connected with the administration of William Pitt.\r\n\r\nThe agitations of moral reformers are among the most prominent and\r\ninteresting. The efforts of benevolent statesmen and philanthropists\r\nto abolish the slave trade produced a great excitement throughout\r\nChristendom, and were followed by great results.\r\n\r\nIn 1787, William Wilberforce, who represented the great county of\r\nYork, brought forward, in the House of Commons, a motion for the\r\nabolition of the slave trade. The first public movements to put a stop\r\nto this infamous traffic were made by the Quakers in the Southern\r\nStates of America, who presented petitions for that purpose to their\r\nrespective legislatures. Their brethren in England followed their\r\nexample, and presented similar petitions to the House of Commons. A\r\nsociety was formed, and a considerable sum was raised to collect\r\ninformation relative to the traffic, and to support the expense of\r\napplication to parliament. A great resistance was expected and made,\r\nchiefly by merchants and planters. Mr. Wilberforce interested himself\r\ngreatly in this investigation, and in May brought the matter before\r\nparliament, and supported his motion with overwhelming arguments and\r\neloquence. Mr. Fox, Mr. Burke, Mr. William Smith, and Mr. Whitbread\r\nsupported Mr. Wilberforce. Mr. Pitt defended the cause of abolition\r\nwith great eloquence and power; but the House was not then in favor of\r\nimmediate abolition, nor was it carried until Mr. Fox and his friends\r\ncame into power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War with France.]\r\n\r\nThe war with France, in consequence of the progress of the revolution,\r\nis too great a subject to be treated except in a chapter by itself.\r\nMr. Pitt abstained from all warlike demonstrations until the internal\r\ntranquillity of England itself was affected by the propagation of\r\nrevolutionary principles. But when, added to these, it was feared that\r\nthe French were resolved to extend their empire, and overturn the\r\nbalance of power, and encroach on the liberties of England, then Pitt,\r\nsustained by an overwhelming majority in parliament, declared war upon\r\nFrance, (1793.) The advocates of the French Revolution, however, take\r\ndifferent views, and attribute the rise and career of Napoleon to the\r\njealousy and encroachments of England herself, as well as of Austria\r\nand Prussia. Whether the general European war might not have been\r\naverted, is a point which merits inquiry, and on which British\r\nstatesmen are not yet agreed. But the connection of England with this\r\ngreat war will be presented in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt continued to manage the helm of state until 1806; but all his\r\nenergies were directed to the prosecution of the war, and no other\r\nevents of importance took place during his administration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Policy of Pitt.]\r\n\r\nHis genius most signally was displayed in his financial skill in\r\nextricating his nation from the great embarrassments which resulted\r\nfrom the American war, and in providing the means to prosecute still\r\nmore expensive campaigns against Napoleon and his generals. He also\r\nhad unrivalled talent in managing the House of Commons against one of\r\nthe most powerful oppositions ever known, and in a period of great\r\npublic excitements. He was always ready in debate, and always retained\r\nthe confidence of the nation. He is probably the greatest of the\r\nEnglish statesmen, so far as talents are concerned, and so far as he\r\nrepresented the ideas and sentiments of his age. But it is a question\r\nwhich will long perplex philosophers whether he was the wisest of that\r\ngreat constellation of geniuses who enlightened his brilliant age. To\r\nhim may be ascribed the great increase of the national debt. If taxes\r\nare the greatest calamity which can afflict a nation, then Pitt has\r\nentailed a burden of misery which will call forth eternal curses on\r\nhis name, in spite of all the brilliancy of his splendid\r\nadministration. But if the glory and welfare of nations consist in\r\nother things--in independence, patriotism, and rational liberty; if it\r\nwas desirable, above all material considerations, to check the current\r\nof revolutionary excess, and oppose the career of a man who aimed to\r\nbring all the kings and nations of Europe under the yoke of an\r\nabsolute military despotism, and rear a universal empire on the ruins\r\nof ancient monarchies and states,--then Pitt and his government should\r\nbe contemplated in a different light.\r\n\r\nThat mighty contest which developed the energies of this great\r\nstatesman, as well as the genius of a still more remarkable man,\r\ntherefore claims our attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Tomline\'s Life of Pitt.

The wars which\r\ngrew out of the Revolution in France were conducted on a scale of much\r\ngreater magnitude, and embroiled all the nations of Europe. A greater\r\nexpenditure of energies took place than from any contest in the annals\r\nof civilized nations. Nor has any contest ever before developed so\r\ngreat military genius. Napoleon stands at the head of his profession,\r\nby general consent; and it is probable that his fame will increase,\r\nrather than diminish, with advancing generations.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe, in a few pages, the great and varied\r\nevents connected with the French Revolution, or even allude to all the\r\nprominent ones. The causes of this great movement are even more\r\ninteresting than the developments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Causes of the French Revolution.]\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked, could Louis\xc2\xa0XVI. have prevented the\r\ncatastrophe which overturned his throne? He might, perhaps, have\r\ndelayed it; but it was an inevitable event, and would have happened,\r\nsooner or later. There were evils in the government of France, and in\r\nthe condition of the people, so overwhelming and melancholy, that they\r\nwould have produced an outbreak. Had Richelieu never been minister;\r\nhad the Fronde never taken place; had Louis\xc2\xa0XIV. and\xc2\xa0XV. never\r\nreigned; had there been no such women as disgraced the court of France\r\nin the eighteenth century; had there been no tyrannical kings, no\r\noppressive nobles, no grievous taxes, no national embarrassments, no\r\nluxurious courts, no infidel writings, and no discontented\r\npeople,--then Louis\xc2\xa0XVI. might have reigned at Versailles, as\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XV. had done before him. But the accumulated grievances of two\r\ncenturies called imperatively for redress, and nothing short of a\r\nrevolution could have removed them.\r\n\r\nNow, what were those evils and those circumstances which, of\r\nnecessity, produced the most violent revolutionary storm in the annals\r\nof the world? The causes of the French revolution may be generalized\r\nunder five heads: First, the influence of the writings of infidel\r\nphilosophers; second, the diffusion of the ideas of popular rights;\r\nthird, the burdens of the people, which made these abstract ideas of\r\nright a mockery; fourth, the absurd infatuation of the court and\r\nnobles; fifth, the derangement of the finances, which clogged the\r\nwheels of government, and led to the assembling of the States General.\r\nThere were also other causes: but the above mentioned are the most\r\nprominent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Helvetius--Voltaire.]\r\n\r\nOf those philosophers whose writings contributed to produce this\r\nrevolution, there were four who exerted a remarkable influence. These\r\nwere Helvetius, Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot.\r\n\r\nHelvetius was a man of station and wealth, and published, in 1758, a\r\nbook, in which he carried out the principles of Condillac and of other\r\nphilosophers of the sensational, or, as it is sometimes called, the\r\nsensuous school. He boldly advocated a system of undisguised\r\nselfishness. He maintained that man owed his superiority over the\r\nlower animals to the superior organization of the body. Proceeding\r\nfrom this point, he asserted, further, that every faculty and emotion\r\nare derived from sensation; that all minds are originally equal; that\r\npleasure is the only good, and self-interest the only ground of\r\nmorality. The materialism of Helvetius was the mere revival of pagan\r\nEpicurianism; but it was popular, and his work, called _De l\'Esprit_,\r\nmade a great sensation. It was congenial with the taste of a court and\r\na generation that tolerated Madame de Pompadour. But the Parliament of\r\nParis condemned it, and pronounced it derogatory to human nature,\r\ninasmuch as it confined our faculties to animal sensibility, and\r\ndestroyed the distinctions between virtue and vice.\r\n\r\nHis fame was eclipsed by the brilliant career of Voltaire, who\r\nexercised a greater influence on his age than any other man. He is the\r\ngreat apostle of French infidelity, and the great oracle of the\r\nsuperficial thinkers of his nation and age. He was born in 1694, and\r\nearly appeared upon the stage. He was a favorite at Versailles, and a\r\ncompanion of Frederic the Great--as great an egotist as he, though his\r\negotism was displayed in a different way. He was an aristocrat, made\r\nfor courts, and not for the people, with whom he had no sympathy,\r\nalthough the tendency of his writings was democratic. In all his\r\nsatirical sallies, he professed to respect authority. But he was never\r\nin earnest, was sceptical, insincere, and superficial. It would not be\r\nrendering him justice to deny that he had great genius. But his genius\r\nwas to please, to amuse a vain-glorious people, to turn every thing\r\ninto ridicule, to pull down, and substitute nothing instead. He was a\r\nmodern Lucian, and his satirical mockery destroyed reverence for God\r\nand truth. He despised and defied the future, and the future has\r\nrendered a verdict which can never be reversed--that he was vain,\r\nselfish, shallow, and cold, without faith in any spiritual influence\r\nto change the world. But he had a keen perception of what was false,\r\nwith all his superficial criticism, a perception of what is now called\r\n_humbug_; and it cannot be denied that, in a certain sense, he had a\r\nlove of truth, but not of truth in its highest development, not of the\r\npositive, the affirmative, the real. Negation and denial suited him\r\nbetter, and suited the age in which he lived better; hence he was a\r\n"representative man," was an exponent of his age, and led the age. He\r\nhated the Jesuits, but chiefly because they advocated a blind\r\nauthority; and he strove to crush Christianity, because its professors\r\nso often were a disgrace to it, while its best members were martyrs\r\nand victims. Voltaire did not, like Helvetius, propose any new system\r\nof philosophy, but strove to make all systems absurd. He set the ball\r\nof Atheism in motion, and others followed in a bolder track: pushed\r\nout, not his principles, for he had none, but his spirit, into the\r\nextreme of mockery and negation. And such a course unsettled the\r\npopular faith, both in religion and laws, and made men indifferent to\r\nthe future, and to their moral obligations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rousseau.]\r\n\r\nQuite a different man was Rousseau. He was not a mocker, or a\r\nleveller, or a satirist, or an atheist. He resembled Voltaire only in\r\none respect--in egotism. He was not so learned as Voltaire, did not\r\nwrite so much, was not so highly honored or esteemed. But he had more\r\ngenius, and exercised a greater influence on posterity. His influence\r\nwas more subtle and more dangerous, for he led astray people of\r\ngenerous impulses and enthusiastic dispositions, with but little\r\nintelligence or experience. He abounded in extravagant admiration of\r\nunsophisticated nature, professed to love the simple and earnest,\r\naffected extraordinary friendship and sympathy, and was most\r\nenthusiastic in his rhapsodies of sentimental love. Voltaire had no\r\ncant, but Rousseau was full of it. Voltaire was the father of Danton,\r\nbut Rousseau of Robespierre, that sentimental murderer who as a judge,\r\nwas too conscientious to hang a criminal, but sufficiently\r\nunscrupulous to destroy a king. The absurdities of Rousseau can be\r\ndetected in the ravings of the ultra Transcendentalists, in the\r\nextravagance of Fourierism, in the mock philanthropy of such apostles\r\nof light as Eugene Sue and Louis Blanc. The whole mental and physical\r\nconstitution of Rousseau was diseased, and his actions were strangely\r\ninconsistent with his sentiments. He gave the kiss of friendship, and\r\nit proved the token of treachery; he expatiated on simplicity and\r\nearnestness in most bewitching language, but was a hypocrite, seducer,\r\nand liar. He was always breathing the raptures of affection, yet never\r\nsucceeded in keeping a friend; he was always denouncing the\r\nselfishness and vanity of the world, and yet was miserable without its\r\nrewards and praises; no man was more dependent on society, yet no man\r\never professed to hold it in deeper contempt; no man ever had a\r\nprouder spirit, yet no man ever affected a more abject humility. He\r\ndilated, with apparent rapture, on disinterested love, and yet left\r\nhis own children to cold neglect and poverty. He poisoned the weak and\r\nthe susceptible by pouring out streams of passion in eloquent and\r\nexciting language, under the pretence of unburdening his own soul and\r\nrevealing his own sorrows. He was always talking about philanthropy\r\nand generosity, and yet seldom bestowed a charity. No man was ever\r\nmore eloquent in paradox, or sublime in absurdity. He spent his life\r\nin gilding what is corrupt, and glossing over what is impure. The\r\ngreat moral effect of his writings was to make men commit crimes under\r\nthe name of patriotism, and permit them to indulge in selfish passion\r\nunder the name of love.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diderot.]\r\n\r\nBut more powerful than either of these false prophets and guides, in\r\nimmediate influence, was Diderot; and with him the whole school of\r\nbold and avowed infidels, who united open atheism with a fierce\r\ndemocracy. The Encyclopedists professed to know every thing, to\r\nexplain every thing, and to teach every thing, they discovered that\r\nthere was no God, and taught that truth was a delusion, and virtue but\r\na name. They were learned in mathematical, statistical, and physical\r\nscience, but threw contempt on elevated moral wisdom, on the lessons\r\nof experience, and the eternal truths of divine revelation. They\r\nadvocated changes, experiments, fomentations, and impracticable\r\nreforms. They preached a gospel of social rights, inflamed the people\r\nwith disgust of their condition, and with the belief that wisdom and\r\nvirtue resided, in the greatest perfection, with congregated masses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Influence of the Philosophers.]\r\n\r\nThey incessantly boasted of the greatness of philosophy, and the\r\nobsolete character of Christianity. They believed that successive\r\ndevelopments of human nature, without the aid of influences foreign to\r\nitself, would gradually raise society to a state of perfection. What\r\nthey could not explain by their logical formularies, they utterly\r\ndiscarded. They denied the reality of a God in heaven, and talked\r\nabout the divinity of man on earth, especially when associated masses\r\nof the ignorant and brutal asserted what they conceived to be their\r\nrights. They made truth to reside, in its greatest lustre, with\r\npassionate majorities; and virtue, in its purest radiance, with felons\r\nand vagabonds, if affiliated into a great association. They flattered\r\nthe people that they were wiser and better than any classes above\r\nthem, that rulers were tyrants, the clergy were hypocrites, the\r\noracles of former days mere fools and liars. To sum up, in few words,\r\nthe French Encyclopedists, "they made Nature, in her outward\r\nmanifestations, to be the foundation of all great researches, man to\r\nbe but a mass of organization, mind the development of our sensations,\r\nmorality to consist in self-interest, and God to be but the diseased\r\nfiction of an unenlightened age. The whole intellect, being\r\nconcentrated on the outward and material, gave rise, perhaps, to some\r\nimprovements in physical science; but religion was disowned, morality\r\ndegraded, and man made to be but the feeble link in the great chain of\r\nevents by which Nature is inevitably accomplishing her blind designs."\r\nFrom such influences, what could we expect but infidelity, madness,\r\nanarchy, and crimes?\r\n\r\nThe second cause of the French revolution was the diffusion of the\r\nideas of democratic liberty. Rousseau was a republican in his\r\npolitics, as he was a sentimentalist in religion. Thomas Paine\'s Age\r\nof Reason had a great influence on the French mind, as it also had on\r\nthe English and American. Moreover, the apostles of liberty in France\r\nwere much excited in view of the success of the American Revolution,\r\nand fancied that the words "popular liberty," "sovereignty of the\r\npeople," the "rights of man," "liberty and equality," meant the same\r\nin America as they did when pronounced by a Parisian mob. The French\r\npeople were unduly flattered, and made to believe, by the demagogues,\r\nthat they were philosophers, and that they were as fit for liberty as\r\nthe American nation itself. Moreover, it must be confessed that the\r\npeople had really made considerable advances, and discovered that\r\nthere was no right or justice in the oppressions under which they\r\ngroaned. The exhortations of popular leaders and the example of\r\nAmerican patriots prepared the people to make a desperate effort to\r\nshake off their fetters. What were rights, in the abstract, if they\r\nwere to be ground down to the dust? What a mockery was the watchword\r\nof liberty and equality, if they were obliged to submit to a despotism\r\nwhich they knew to be, in the highest degree, oppressive and\r\ntyrannical?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sufferings of the People.]\r\n\r\nHence the real and physical evils which the people of France endured,\r\nhad no small effect in producing the revolution. Abstract ideas\r\nprepared the way, and sustained the souls of the oppressed; but the\r\nabsolute burdens which they bore aroused them to resistance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Degradation of the People.]\r\n\r\nThese evils were so great, that general discontent prevailed among the\r\nmiddle and lower classes through the kingdom. The agricultural\r\npopulation was fettered by game laws and odious privileges to the\r\naristocracy. "Game of the most destructive kind, such as wild boars\r\nand herds of deer, were permitted to go at large through spacious\r\ndistricts, in order that the nobles might hunt as in a savage\r\nwilderness." Numerous edicts prohibited weeding, lest young partridges\r\nshould be disturbed, and mowing of hay even, lest their eggs should be\r\ndestroyed. Complaints for the infraction of these edicts were carried\r\nbefore courts where every species of oppression and fraud prevailed.\r\nFines were imposed at every change of property and at every sale. The\r\npeople were compelled to grind their corn at their landlord\'s mill, to\r\npress their grapes in his press, and bake their bread in his oven. In\r\nconsequence of these feudal laws and customs, the people were very\r\npoor, their houses dark and comfortless, their dress ragged and\r\nmiserable, their food coarse and scanty. Not half of the enormous\r\ntaxes which they paid reached the royal treasury, or even the pockets\r\nof the great proprietors. Officers were indefinitely multiplied. The\r\ngoverning classes looked upon the people only to be robbed. Their cry\r\nwas unheard in the courts of justice, while the tear of sorrow was\r\nunnoticed amid the pageantry of the great, whose extravagance,\r\ninsolence, and pride were only surpassed by the misery and degradation\r\nof those unfortunate beings on whose toils they lived. Justice was\r\nbought and sold like any other commodity, and the decisions of judges\r\nwere influenced by the magnitude of the bribes which were offered\r\nthem. Besides feudal taxes, the clergy imposed additional burdens, and\r\nswarmed wherever there was plunder to be obtained. The people were so\r\nextravagantly taxed that it was no object to be frugal or industrious.\r\nEvery thing beyond the merest necessaries of life was seized by\r\nvarious tax-gatherers. In England, severe as is taxation, three\r\nfourths of the produce of the land go to the farmer, while in France\r\nonly one twelfth went to the poor peasant. Two thirds of his earnings\r\nwent to the king. Nor was there any appeal from this excessive\r\ntaxation, which ground down the middle and lower classes, while the\r\nclergy and the nobles were entirely exempted themselves. Nor did the\r\nrich proprietor live upon his estates. He was a non-resident, and\r\nsquandered in the cities the money which was extorted from his\r\ndependents. He took no interest in the condition of the peasantry,\r\nwith whom he was not united by any common ties. Added to this\r\noppression, the landlord was cruel, haughty, and selfish; and he\r\nirritated by his insolence as well as oppressed by his injustice. All\r\nsituations in the army, the navy, the church, the court, the bench,\r\nand in diplomacy were exclusively filled by the aristocracy, of whom\r\nthere were one hundred and fifty thousand people--a class insolent,\r\nhaughty, effeminate, untaxed; who disdained useful employments, who\r\nsought to live by the labor of others, and who regarded those by whose\r\ntoils they were enabled to lead lives of dissipation and pleasure, as\r\nignoble minions, who were unworthy of a better destiny, and unfit to\r\nenjoy those rights which God designed should be possessed by the whole\r\nhuman race.\r\n\r\nThe privileges and pursuits of the aristocratic class, from the king\r\nto a lieutenant in his army, were another cause of revolution.\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XV. squandered twenty million pounds sterling in pleasures too\r\nignominious to be even named in the public accounts, and enjoyed\r\nalmost absolute power. He could send any one in his dominions to rot\r\nin an ignominious prison, without a hearing or a trial. The odious\r\n_lettre de cachet_ could consign the most powerful noble to a dungeon,\r\nand all were sent to prison who were offensive to government. The\r\nking\'s mistresses sometimes had the power of sending their enemies to\r\nprison without consulting the king. The lives and property of the\r\npeople were at his absolute disposal, and he did not scruple to\r\nexercise his power with thoughtless, and sometimes inhuman cruelty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Derangement of Finances.]\r\n\r\nBut these evils would have ended only in disaffection, and hatred, and\r\nunsuccessful resistance, had not the royal finances been deranged. So\r\nlong as the king and his ministers could obtain money, there was no\r\nimmediate danger of revolution. So long as he could pay the army, it\r\nwould, if decently treated, support an absolute throne.\r\n\r\nBut the king at last found it difficult to raise a sufficient revenue\r\nfor his pleasures and his wars. The annual deficit was one hundred and\r\nninety million of francs a year. The greater the deficit, the greater\r\nwas the taxation, which, of course, increased the popular discontent.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things when Louis\xc2\xa0XVI. ascended the throne of\r\nHugh Capet, (1774,) in his twentieth year, having married, four years\r\nbefore, Marie Antoinette, daughter of Maria Theresa, empress of\r\nAustria. He was grandson of Louis\xc2\xa0XV., who bequeathed to him a debt of\r\nfour thousand millions of livres.\r\n\r\nThe new king was amiable and moral, and would have ruled France in\r\npeaceful times, but was unequal to a revolutionary crisis. "Of all the\r\nmonarchs," says Alison, "of the Capetian line, he was the least able\r\nto stem, and yet the least likely to provoke, a revolution. The people\r\nwere tired of the arbitrary powers of their monarch, and he was\r\ndisposed to abandon them; they were provoked at the expensive\r\ncorruptions of the court, and he was both innocent in his manners, and\r\nunexpensive in his habits; they demanded reformation in the\r\nadministration of affairs, and he placed his chief glory in yielding\r\nto the public voice. His reign, from his accession to the throne to\r\nthe meeting of the States General, was nothing but a series of\r\nameliorations, without calming the public effervescence. He had the\r\nmisfortune to wish sincerely for the public good, without possessing\r\nthe firmness necessary to secure it; and with truth it may be said\r\nthat reforms were more fatal to him than the continuance of abuses\r\nwould have been to another sovereign."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maurepas--Turgot--Malesherbes.]\r\n\r\nHe made choice of Maurepas as his prime minister, an old courtier\r\nwithout talent, and who was far from comprehending the spirit of the\r\nnation or the genius of the times. He accustomed the king to half\r\nmeasures, and pursued a temporizing policy, ill adapted to\r\nrevolutionary times. The discontents of the people induced the king to\r\ndismiss him, and Turgot, for whom the people clamored, became prime\r\nminister. He was an honest man, and contemplated important reforms,\r\neven to the abolition of feudal privileges and the odious _lettres de\r\ncachet_, which were of course opposed by the old nobility, and were\r\nnot particularly agreeable to the sovereign himself.\r\n\r\nMalesherbes, a lawyer who adopted the views of Turgot, succeeded him,\r\nand, had he been permitted, would have restored the rights of the\r\npeople, and suppressed the _lettres de cachet_, re\xc3\xabnacted the Edict of\r\nNantes, and secured the liberty of the press. But he was not equal to\r\nthe crisis, with all his integrity and just views, and Necker became\r\nfinancial minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Necker--Calonne.]\r\n\r\nHe was a native of Geneva, a successful banker, and a man who had won\r\nthe confidence of the nation. He found means to restore the finances,\r\nand to defray the expenses of the American war. But he was equally\r\nopposed by the nobles, who wanted no radical reform, and he was not a\r\nman of sufficient talent to stem the current of revolution. Financial\r\nskill was certainly desirable, but no financiering could save the\r\nFrench nation on the eve of bankruptcy with such vast expenditures as\r\nthen were deemed necessary. The nobles indeed admitted the extent of\r\nthe evils which existed, and descanted, on their hunting parties, in a\r\nstrain of mock philanthropy, but would submit to no sacrifices\r\nthemselves, and Necker was compelled to resign.\r\n\r\nM. de Calonne took his place; a man of ready invention, unscrupulous,\r\nwitty, and brilliant. Self-confident and full of promises, he\r\nsucceeded in imparting a gleam of sunshine, and pursued a plan\r\ndirectly the opposite to that adopted by Necker. He encouraged the\r\nextravagance of the court, derided the future, and warded off pressing\r\ndebts by contracting new ones. He pleased all classes by his\r\ncaptivating manners, brilliant conversation, and elegant dress. The\r\nking, furnished with what money he wanted, forgot the burdens of the\r\npeople, and the minister went on recklessly contracting new loans, and\r\nstudiously concealing from the public the extent of the annual\r\ndeficit.\r\n\r\nBut such a policy could not long be adopted successfully, and the\r\npeople were overwhelmed with amazement when it finally appeared that,\r\nsince the retirement of Necker in 1781, Calonne had added sixteen\r\nhundred and forty-six millions of francs to the public debt. National\r\nbankruptcy stared every body in the face. It was necessary that an\r\nextraordinary movement should be made; and Calonne recommended the\r\nassembling of the Notables, a body composed chiefly of the nobility,\r\nclergy, and magistracy, with the hope that these aristocrats would\r\nconsent to their own taxation.\r\n\r\nHe was miserably mistaken. The Notables met, (1787,) the first time\r\nsince the reign of Henry\xc2\xa0IV., and demanded the dismissal of the\r\nminister, who was succeeded by Brienne, Archbishop of Toulouse.\r\n\r\nHe was a weak man, and owed his elevation to his influence with women.\r\nHe won the queen by his pleasing conversation, but had no solid\r\nacquirements. Occupying one of the highest positions in his church, he\r\nyet threw himself into the arms of atheistical philosophers. A man so\r\ninconsistent and so light was not fit for his place.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Notables agreed to what they had refused to Calonne. They\r\nconsented to a land tax, to the stamp duty, to provincial assemblies,\r\nand to the suppression of the gratuitous service of vassals. These\r\nwere popular measures, but were insufficient. Brienne was under the\r\nnecessity of proposing the imposition of new taxes. But the Parliament\r\nof Paris refused to register the edict. A struggle between the king\r\nand the parliament resulted; and the king, in order to secure the\r\nregistration of new taxes, resorted to the _bed of justice_--the last\r\nstretch of his royal power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: States General.]\r\n\r\nDuring one of the meetings of the parliament, when the abuses and\r\nprodigality of the court were denounced, a member, punning upon the\r\nword _\xc3\xa9tats_, (statements,) exclaimed, "It is not statements but\r\nStates General that we want."\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, nothing was thought of or talked about but the\r\nassembling of the States General; to which the minister, from his\r\nincreasing embarrassments, consented. Moreover, the court hoped, in\r\nview of the continued opposition of the parliament, that the Tiers\r\n\xc3\x89tat would defend the throne against the legal aristocracy.\r\n\r\nAll classes formed great and extravagant expectations from the\r\nassembling of the States General, and all were doomed to\r\ndisappointment, but none more than those who had most vehemently and\r\nenthusiastically called for its convocation.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Toulouse soon after retired, unable to stem the\r\nrevolutionary current. But he contrived to make his own fortune, by\r\nsecuring benefices to the amount of eight hundred thousand francs, the\r\narchbishopric of Sens, and a cardinal\'s hat. At his recommendation\r\nNecker was recalled.\r\n\r\nOn Necker\'s return, he found only two hundred and fifty thousand\r\nfrancs in the royal treasury; but the funds immediately rose, thirty\r\nper cent., and he was able to secure the loans necessary to carry on\r\nthe government, rich capitalists fearing that absolute ruin would\r\nresult unless they came to his assistance.\r\n\r\nThen followed discussions in reference to the Tiers \xc3\x89tat, as to what\r\nthe third estate really represented, and as to the number of deputies\r\nwho should be called to the assembly of the States General. "The Tiers\r\n\xc3\x89tat," said the Abb\xc3\xa9 Si\xc3\xa8yes, in an able pamphlet, "is the French\r\nnation, _minus_ the noblesse and the clergy."\r\n\r\nIt was at last decided that the assembly should be at least one\r\nthousand, and that the number of deputies should equal the\r\nrepresentatives of the nobles and clergy. The elections, were\r\ncarelessly conducted, and all persons, decently dressed, were allowed\r\nto vote. Upwards of three millions of electors determined the choice\r\nof deputies. Necker conceded too much, and opened the flood-gates of\r\nrevolution. He had no conception of the storm, which was to overwhelm\r\nthe throne.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of May, 1789, that famous Assembly, which it was hoped\r\nwould restore prosperity to France, met with great pomp in the\r\ncathedral church of Notre Dame, and the Bishop of Nancy delivered the\r\nsermon, and, the next day, the assembly was opened in the hall\r\nprepared for the occasion. The king was seated on a magnificent\r\nthrone, the nobles and the clergy on both sides of the hall, and the\r\nthird estate at the farther end. Louis\xc2\xa0XVI. pronounced a speech full\r\nof disinterested sentiments, and Necker read a report in reference to\r\nthe state of the finances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tiers \xc3\x89tat.]\r\n\r\nThe next day, the deputies of the Tiers \xc3\x89tat were directed to the\r\nplace allotted to them, which was the common hall. The nobles and\r\nclergy repaired to a separate hall. It was their intention, especially\r\nin view of the great number of the deputies, to deliberate in distinct\r\nhalls. But the deputies insisted upon the three orders deliberating\r\ntogether in the same room. Angry discussions and conferences took\r\nplace. But there was not sufficient union between the nobles and the\r\nclergy, or sufficient energy on the part of the court. There happened\r\nalso to be some bold and revolutionary spirits among the deputies, and\r\nthey finally resolved, by a majority of four hundred and ninety-one to\r\nninety, to assume the title of _National Assembly_, and invited the\r\nmembers of the other chamber to join them. They erected themselves\r\ninto a sovereign power, like the Long Parliament of Charles\xc2\xa0I.,\r\ndisregarding both the throne and the nobility.\r\n\r\nSome of the most resolute of the nobles urged the king to adopt\r\nvigorous measures against the usurpation of the third estate; but he\r\nwas timid and irresolute.\r\n\r\nThe man who had, at that time, the greatest influence in the National\r\nAssembly was Mirabeau, a man of noble birth, but who had warmly\r\nespoused the popular side. He was disagreeable in his features,\r\nlicentious in his habits, and a bankrupt in reputation, but a man of\r\ncommanding air, of great abilities, and unrivalled eloquence. His\r\npicture has been best painted by Carlyle, both in his essays and his\r\nhistory of the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly contained many great men, who would never have\r\nbeen heard of in quiet times; some of great virtues and abilities, and\r\nothers of the most violent revolutionary principles. There were also\r\nsome of the nobility, who joined them, not anticipating the evils\r\nwhich were to come. Among them were the Dukes of Orleans,\r\nRochefoucault, and Liancourt, Count Lally Tollendal, the two brothers\r\nLameth, Clermont Tonnerre, and the Marquis de La Fayette, all of whom\r\nwere guillotined or exiled during the revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commotions.]\r\n\r\nThe discussions in the Assembly did not equal the tumults of the\r\npeople. All classes were intoxicated with excitement, and believed\r\nthat a new era was to take place on earth; that all the evils which\r\nafflicted society were to be removed, and a state of unbounded\r\nliberty, plenty, and prosperity, was about to take place.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the popular ferments, the regiment of guards,\r\ncomprising three thousand six hundred men, revolted: immense bodies of\r\nworkmen assembled together, and gave vent to the most inflammatory\r\nlanguage; the Hotel of the Invalids was captured; fifty thousand pikes\r\nwere forged and distributed among the people; the Bastile was stormed;\r\nand military massacres commenced. Soon after, the tricolored cockade\r\nwas adopted, the French guards were suppressed by the Assembly, the\r\nking and his family were brought to Paris by a mob, and the Club of\r\nthe Jacobins was established. Before the year 1789 was ended, the\r\nNational Assembly was the supreme power in France, and the king had\r\nbecome a shadow and a mockery; or, rather, it should be said that\r\nthere was no authority in France but what emanated from the people,\r\nand no power remained to suppress popular excesses and insurrections.\r\nThe Assembly published proclamations against acts of violence; but it\r\nwas committed in a contest with the crown and aristocracy, and\r\nespoused the popular side. A famine, added to other horrors, set in at\r\nParis; and the farmers, fearing that their grain would be seized, no\r\nlonger brought it to market. Manufactures of all kinds were suspended,\r\nand the public property was confiscated to supply the immediate wants\r\nof a starving and infuriated people. A state was rapidly hastening to\r\nuniversal violence, crime, misery, and despair.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rule of the People.]\r\n\r\nThe year 1790 opened gloomily, and no one could tell when the\r\nagitating spirit would cease, or how far it would be carried, for the\r\nmob of Paris was rapidly engrossing the power of the state. One of the\r\nfirst measures of the Assembly was to divest the provinces of France\r\nof their ancient privileges, since they were jealous of the\r\nsovereignty exercised by the Assembly, and to divide the kingdom into\r\neighty-four new departments, nearly equal in extent and population. A\r\ncriminal tribunal was established for each department and a civil\r\ncourt for each of the districts into which the department was divided.\r\nThe various officers and magistrates were elected by the people, and\r\nthe qualification for voting was a contribution to the amount of three\r\ndays\' labor. By this great stop, the whole civil force in the kingdom\r\nwas placed at the disposal of the lower classes. They had the\r\nnomination of the municipality, and the control of the military, and\r\nthe appointment of judges, deputies, and officers of the National\r\nGuard. Forty-eight thousand communes, or municipalities, exercised all\r\nthe rights of sovereignty, and hardly any appointment was left to the\r\ncrown. A complete democratic constitution was made, which subverted\r\nthe ancient divisions of the kingdom, and all those prejudices and\r\ninterests which had been nursed for centuries. The great extension of\r\nthe electoral franchise introduced into the Assembly a class of men\r\nwho were prepared to make the most impracticable changes, and commit\r\nthe most violent excesses.\r\n\r\nThe next great object of the Assembly was the regulation of the\r\nfinances. Further taxation was impossible, and the public necessities\r\nwere great. The revenue had almost failed, and the national debt had\r\nalarmingly increased,--twelve hundred millions in less than three\r\nyears. The capitalists would advance nothing, and voluntary\r\ncontributions had produced but a momentary relief. Under these\r\ncircumstances, the spoliation of the church was resolved, and\r\nTalleyrand, Bishop of Autun, was the first to propose the confiscation\r\nof the property of his order. The temptation was irresistible to an\r\ninfidel and revolutionary assembly; for the church owned nearly one\r\nhalf of the whole landed property of the kingdom. Several thousand\r\nmillions of francs were confiscated, and the revenues of the clergy\r\nreduced to one fifth of their former amount.\r\n\r\nThis violent measure led to another. There was no money to pay for the\r\ngreat estates which the Assembly wished to sell. The municipalities of\r\nthe large cities became the purchasers, and gave promissory notes to\r\nthe public creditors until payment should be made; supposing that\r\nindividuals would buy in small portions. Sales not being effected by\r\nthe municipalities, as was expected and payment becoming due, recourse\r\nwas had to government bills. Thus arose the system of _Assignats_,\r\nwhich were issued to a great amount on the security of the church\r\nlands, and which resulted in a paper circulation, and the\r\nestablishment of a vast body of small landholders, whose property\r\nsprung out of the revolution, and whose interests were identified with\r\nit. The relief, however great, was momentary. New issues were made at\r\nevery crisis, until the over issue alarmed the reflecting portion of\r\nthe community, and assignats depreciated to a mere nominal value. At\r\nthe close of the year, the credit of the nation was destroyed, and the\r\nprecious metals were withdrawn, in a great measure, from circulation.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the assembly abolished all titles of nobility, changed the\r\nwhole judicial system, declared its right to make peace and war, and\r\nestablished the National Guard, by which three hundred thousand men\r\nwere enrolled in support of revolutionary measures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: National Federation.]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of July, the anniversary of the capture of the Bastile,\r\nwas the celebrated National Federation, when four hundred thousand\r\npersons repaired to the Champ de Mars, to witness the king, his\r\nministers, the assembly, and the public functionaries, take the oath\r\nto the new constitution; the greatest mockery of the whole revolution,\r\nalthough a scene of unparalleled splendor.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the year, an extensive emigration of the nobles\r\ntook place; a great blunder on their part, since their estates were\r\nimmediately confiscated, and since the forces left to support the\r\nthrone were much diminished. The departure of so many distinguished\r\npersons, however, displeased the Assembly, and proposals were made to\r\nprevent it. But Mirabeau, who, until this time, had supported the\r\npopular side, now joined the throne, and endeavored to save it. His\r\npopularity was on the decline, when a natural death relieved him from\r\na probable execution. He had contributed to raise the storm, but he\r\nhad not the power to allay it. He exerted his splendid abilities to\r\narrest the revolution, whose consequences, at last, he plainly\r\nperceived. But in vain. His death, however, was felt as a public\r\ncalamity, and all Paris assembled to see his remains deposited, with\r\nextraordinary pomp, in the Pantheon, by the side of Des Cartes. Had he\r\nlived, he might possibly have saved the lives of the king and queen,\r\nbut he could not have prevented the revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of the King.]\r\n\r\nSoon after, the royal family, perceiving, too late, that they were\r\nmere prisoners in the Tuileries, undertook to escape, and fly to\r\nCoblentz, where the great body of emigrants resided. The unfortunate\r\nking contrived to reach Varennes, was recognized, and brought back to\r\nParis. But the National Assembly made a blunder in not permitting him\r\nto escape; for it had only to declare the throne vacant by his\r\ndesertion, and proceed to institute a republican government. The crime\r\nof regicide might have been avoided, and further revolutionary\r\nexcesses prevented. But his return increased the popular ferments, and\r\nthe clubs demanded his head. He was suspended from his functions, and\r\na guard placed over his person.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of September, 1791, the Constituent Assembly dissolved\r\nitself; having, during the three years of its existence enacted\r\nthirteen hundred and nine laws and decrees relative to the general\r\nadministration of the state. It is impossible, even now, to settle the\r\nquestion whether it did good or ill, on the whole; but it certainly\r\nremoved many great and glaring evils, and enacted many wise laws. It\r\nabolished torture, the _lettres de cachet_, the most oppressive\r\nduties, the privileges of the nobility, and feudal burdens. It\r\nestablished a uniform system of jurisprudence, the National Guards,\r\nand an equal system of finance. "It opened the army to men of merit,\r\nand divided the landed property of the aristocracy among the laboring\r\nclasses; which, though a violation of the rights of property, enabled\r\nthe nation to bear the burdens which were subsequently imposed, and to\r\nprosper under the evils connected with national bankruptcy,\r\ndepreciated assignats, the Reign of Terror, the conscription of\r\nNapoleon, and the subjugation of Europe."\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Assembly, composed of inexperienced men,--country\r\nattorneys and clerks for the most part, among whom there were not\r\nfifty persons possessed of one hundred pounds a year,--took the place\r\nof the Constituent Assembly, and opened its sittings on the 1st of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nIn the first assembly there was a large party attached to royal and\r\naristocratical interests, and many men of great experience and\r\ntalents. But in the second nearly all were in favor of revolutionary\r\nprinciples. They only differed in regard to the extent to which\r\nrevolution should be carried.\r\n\r\nThe members of the right were called the _Feuillants_, from the club\r\nwhich formed the centre of their power, and were friends of the\r\nconstitution, or the limited monarchy which the Constituent Assembly\r\nhad established. The national guard, the magistrates, and all the\r\nconstituted authorities, were the supporters of this party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Girondists and the Jacobins.]\r\n\r\nThe _Girondists_, comprehending the more respectable of the\r\nrepublicans, and wishing to found the state on the model of antiquity,\r\nformed a second party, among whom were numbered the ablest men in the\r\nassembly. Brissot, Vergniaud, Condorcet, Guadet, and Isnard, were\r\namong the leading members.\r\n\r\nThere was also a third party, headed by Chabot, Bazin, and Merlin,\r\nwhich was supported by the clubs of the _Jacobins_ and the\r\n_Cordeliers_. The great oracles of the Jacobins were Robespierre,\r\nVarennes, and Collot d\'Herbois; while the leaders of the Cordeliers\r\nwere Danton and Desmoulins. Robespierre was excluded, as were others\r\nof the last assembly, from the new one, by a sort of self-denying\r\nordinance which he himself had proposed. His influence, at that time,\r\nwas immense, from the extravagance of his opinions, the vehemence of\r\nhis language, and the reputation he had acquired for integrity.\r\n\r\nBetween these three parties there were violent contentions, and the\r\nstruggle for ascendency soon commenced, to end in the complete triumph\r\nof the Jacobinical revolutionists.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the restrictions imposed on the king, who still\r\nenjoyed the shadow of authority, the extent of popular excesses, and\r\nthe diffusion of revolutionary principles, induced the leading\r\nmonarchs of Europe to confederate together, in order to suppress\r\ndisturbances in France. In July, the Emperor Leopold appealed to the\r\nsovereigns of Europe to unite for the deliverance of Louis\xc2\xa0XVI.\r\nAustria collected her troops, the emigrants at Coblentz made warlike\r\ndemonstrations, and preparations were made for a contest, which,\r\nbefore it was finished, proved the most bloody and extensive which has\r\ndesolated the world since the fall of the Roman empire.\r\n\r\nThe Constituent Assembly rejected with disdain the dictation of the\r\nvarious European powers; and the new ministry, of which Dumourier and\r\nRoland were the most prominent members, prepared for war. All classes\r\nin France were anxious for it, and war was soon declared. On the 25th\r\nof July, the Duke of Brunswick, with an army of one hundred and\r\nforty-eight thousand Prussians, Austrians, and Hessians, entered the\r\nFrench territory. The spirit of resistance animated all classes, and\r\nthe ardor of the multitude was without a parallel. The manifesto of\r\nthe allied powers indicated the dispositions of the court and\r\nemigrants. Revolt against the throne now seemed necessary, in order to\r\nsecure the liberty of the people, who now had no choice between\r\nvictory and death. On the 25th of July, the Marseillais arrived in\r\nParis, and augmented the strength and confidence of the insurgents.\r\nPopular commotions increased, and the clubs became unmanageable. On\r\nthe 10th of August, the tocsin sounded, the _g\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9rale_ beat in every\r\nquarter of Paris, and that famous insurrection took place which\r\noverturned the throne. The Hotel de Ville was seized by the\r\ninsurgents, the Tuileries was stormed, and the Swiss guards were\r\nmassacred. The last chance for the king to regain his power was lost,\r\nand Paris was in the hands of an infuriated mob.\r\n\r\nThe confinement of the king in the Temple, the departure of the\r\nforeign ambassadors, the flight of emigrants, the confiscation of\r\ntheir estates, the massacres in the prisons, the sack of palaces, the\r\nfall and flight of La Fayette, and the dissolution of the Legislative\r\nAssembly, rapidly succeeded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The National Convention.]\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of September, the National Convention was opened, and was\r\ncomposed of the most violent advocates of revolution. It was ruled by\r\nthose popular orators who had the greatest influence in the clubs. The\r\nmost influential of these leaders were Danton, Marat, and Robespierre.\r\nDanton was the hero of the late insurrection; was a lawyer, a man of\r\nbrutal courage, the slave of sensual passions, and the idol of the\r\nParisian mob. He was made minister of justice, and was the author of\r\nthe subsequent massacres in the prisons. But, with all his ferocity,\r\nhe was lenient to individuals, and recommended humanity after the\r\nperiod of danger had passed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marat--Danton--Robespierre.]\r\n\r\nMarat was a journalist, president of the Jacobin Club, a member of the\r\nconvention, and a violent advocate of revolutionary excesses. His\r\nbloody career was prematurely cut off by the hand of a heroine,\r\nCharlotte Corday, who offered up her own life to rid the country of\r\nthe greatest monster which the annals of crime have consigned to an\r\ninfamous immortality.\r\n\r\nRobespierre was a sentimentalist, and concealed, under the mask of\r\npatriotism and philanthropy, an insatiable ambition, inordinate\r\nvanity, and implacable revenge. He was above the passion of money,\r\nand, when he had at his disposal the lives and fortunes of his\r\ncountrymen, lived upon a few francs a day. It is the fashion to deny\r\nto him any extraordinary talent; but that he was a man of domineering\r\nwill, of invincible courage, and austere enthusiasm appears from\r\nnearly all the actions of his hateful career.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of the awful massacre in the prisons, where more\r\nthan five thousand perished to appease the infatuated vengeance of the\r\nParisian mob, that the National Convention commenced its sittings.\r\n\r\nIts first measure was, to abolish the monarchy, and proclaim a\r\nrepublic; the next, to issue new assignats. The two preceding\r\nassemblies had authorized the fabrication of twenty-seven hundred\r\nmillions of francs, and the Convention added millions more on the\r\nsecurity of the national domains. On the 7th of November, the trial of\r\nthe king was decreed; and, on the 11th of December, his examination\r\ncommenced. On his appearance at the bar of the Convention, the\r\npresident, Barrere, said, "Louis, the French nation accuses you; you\r\nare about to hear the charges that are to be preferred. Louis, be\r\nseated."\r\n\r\nThe charges consisted of the whole crimes of the revolution, to which\r\nhe replied with dignity, simplicity, and directness. He was defended,\r\nin the mock trial, by Des\xc3\xa8ze, Tronchet, and Malesherbes; but his blood\r\nwas demanded, and the assembly unanimously pronounced the condemnation\r\nof their king. That seven hundred men, with all the natural\r\ndifferences of opinion, could be found to do this, shows the excess of\r\nrevolutionary madness. On the 20th of January, Santerre appeared in\r\nthe royal prison, and read the sentence of death; and only three days\r\nwere allowed the king to prepare for the last hour of anguish. On the\r\n24th of January, he mounted the scaffold erected between the garden of\r\nthe Tuileries and the Champs \xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es, and the fatal axe separated his\r\nhead from his body. His remains were buried in the ancient cemetery of\r\nthe Madeleine, over which Napoleon commenced, after the battle of\r\nJena, a splendid temple of glory, but which was not finished until the\r\nrestoration of the Bourbons, who converted it into the beautiful\r\nchurch which bears the name of the ancient cemetery. The spot where\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XVI. offered up his life, in expiation of the crimes of his\r\nancestors, is now marked by the colossal obelisk of red granite, which\r\nthe French government, in 1831, brought from Egypt, a monument which\r\nhas witnessed the march of Cambyses, and may survive the glory of the\r\nFrench nation itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General War.]\r\n\r\nThe martyrdom of Louis\xc2\xa0XVI. was the signal for a general war. All the\r\npowers of Europe united to suppress the power and the principles of\r\nthe French revolutionists. The Convention, after declaring war against\r\nEngland, Holland, Spain, Austria, Prussia, Portugal, the Two Sicilies,\r\nthe Roman States, Sardinia, and Piedmont,--all of which had combined\r\ntogether,--ordered a levy of three hundred thousand men, instituted a\r\nmilitary tribunal, and imposed a forced loan on the rich of one\r\nthousand millions, and prepared to defend the principles of liberty\r\nand the soil of France. The enthusiasm of the French was unparalleled,\r\nand the energies put forth were most remarkable. Patriotism and\r\nmilitary ardor were combined, and measures such as only extraordinary\r\nnecessities require were unhesitatingly adopted.\r\n\r\nA Committee of Public Safety was appointed, and the dictatorship of\r\nDanton, Marat, and Robespierre commenced, marked by great horrors and\r\nbarbarities, but signalized by wonderful successes in war, and by\r\nexertions which, under common circumstances, would be scarcely\r\ncredited.\r\n\r\nThis committee was composed of twenty-five persons at first, and\r\ntwelve afterwards; but Robespierre and Marat were the leading members.\r\nThe committee assigned to ruling Jacobins the different departments of\r\nthe government. St. Just was intrusted with the duty of denouncing its\r\nenemies; Couthon for bringing forward its general measures; Billaud\r\nVarennes and Collot d\'Herbois with the management of departments;\r\nCarnot was made minister of war; and Robespierre general dictator.\r\nThis committee, though required to report to the Convention, as the\r\nsupreme authority, had really all the power of government. "It named\r\nand dismissed generals, judges, and juries; brought forward all\r\npublic measures in the Convention; ruled provinces and armies;\r\ncontrolled the Revolutionary Tribunal; and made requisitions of men\r\nand money; and appointed revolutionary committees, which sprung up in\r\nevery part of the kingdom to the frightful number of fifty thousand.\r\nIt was the object of the Committee of Public Safety to destroy all who\r\nopposed the spirit of the most violent revolutionary measures. Marat\r\ndeclared that two hundred and sixty thousand heads must fall before\r\nfreedom was secure; the revolutionary committees discovered that seven\r\nhundred thousand persons must be sacrificed."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reign of Terror.]\r\n\r\nThen commenced the Reign of Terror, when all the prisons of France\r\nwere filled with victims, who were generally the most worthy people in\r\nthe community, and whose only crime was in being obnoxious to the\r\nreigning powers. Those who were suspected fled, if possible, but were\r\ngenerally unable to carry away their property. Millions of property\r\nwas confiscated; the prisons were crowded with the rich, the elegant,\r\nand the cultivated classes; thousands were guillotined; and universal\r\nanarchy and fear reigned without a parallel. Deputies, even those who\r\nhad been most instrumental in bringing on the Revolution, were\r\nsacrificed by the triumphant Jacobins. Women and retired citizens were\r\nnot permitted to escape their fear and vengeance. Marie Antoinette,\r\nand the Princess Elizabeth, and Madame Roland, were among the first\r\nvictims. Then followed the executions of Bailly, Mayor of Paris;\r\nBarnave, one of the most eloquent and upright members of the\r\nConstituent Assembly; Dupont Dutertre, one of the ministers of\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XVI.; Lavoisier, the chemist; Condorcet, the philosopher;\r\nGeneral Custine; and General Houchard; all of whom had been the allies\r\nof the present dominant party. The Duke of Orleans, called _\xc3\x89galit\xc3\xa9_,\r\nwho had supported the revolt of the 10th of August, and had voted for\r\nthe execution of the king, shared the fate of Louis\xc2\xa0XVI. He was the\r\nfather of Louis Philippe, and, of all the victims of the revolution,\r\ndied the least lamented.\r\n\r\nThe "Decemvirs" had now destroyed the most illustrious advocates of\r\nconstitutional monarchy and of republican liberty. The slaughter of\r\ntheir old friends now followed. The first victim was Danton himself,\r\nwho had used his influence to put a stop to the bloody executions\r\nwhich then disgraced the country, and had recognized the existence of\r\na God and the rights of humanity. For such sentiments he was denounced\r\nand executed, together with Camille Desmoulins, and Lacroix, who\r\nperished because they were less wicked than their associates. Finally,\r\nthe anarchists themselves fell before the storm which they had raised,\r\nand Hebert, Gobet, Clootz, and Vincent died amid the shouts of general\r\nexecration. The Committee of Public Safety had now all things in their\r\nown way, and, in their iron hands, order resumed its sway from the\r\ninfluence of terror. "The history of the world has no parallel to the\r\nhorrors of that long night of suffering, because it has no parallel to\r\nthe guilt which preceded it; tyranny never assumed so hideous a form,\r\nbecause licentiousness never required so severe a punishment."\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Public Safety, now confident of its strength, decreed\r\nthe disbanding of the revolutionary army, raised to overawe the\r\ncapital, and the dissolution of all the popular societies which did\r\nnot depend on the Jacobin Club, and devoted all their energies to\r\nestablish their power. But death was the means which they took to\r\nsecure it, and two hundred thousand victims filled the prisons of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Robespierre.]\r\n\r\nAt last, fear united the members of the Convention, and they resolved\r\nto free the country of the great tyrant who aimed at the suppression\r\nof all power but his own. "Do not flatter yourselves," said Tallien to\r\nthe Girondists, "that he will spare you, for you have committed an\r\nunpardonable offence in being freemen." "Do you still live?" said he\r\nto the Jacobins; "in a few days, he will have your heads if you do not\r\ntake his." All parties in the assembly resolved to overthrow their\r\ncommon enemy. Robespierre, the chief actor of the bloody tragedy,\r\nDumas, the president of the Revolutionary Tribunal, Henriot, the\r\ncommander of the National Guard, Couthon and St. Just, the tools of\r\nthe tyrant, were denounced, condemned, and executed. The last hours of\r\nRobespierre were horrible beyond description. When he was led to\r\nexecution, the blood flowed from his broken jaw, his face was deadly\r\npale, and he uttered yells of agony, which filled all hearts with\r\nterror. But one woman, nevertheless, penetrated the crowd which\r\nsurrounded him, exclaiming, "Murderer of my kindred! your agony fills\r\nme with joy; descend to hell, covered with the curses of every mother\r\nin France."\r\n\r\nThus terminated the Reign of Terror, during which, nearly nineteen\r\nthousand persons were guillotined; and among these were over two\r\nthousand nobles and one thousand priests, besides immense numbers of\r\nother persons, by war or the axe, in other parts of France.\r\n\r\nBut vigorous measures had been adopted to carry on the war against\r\nunited Christendom. No less than two hundred and eighty thousand men\r\nwere in the field, on the part of the allies, from Basle to Dunkirk.\r\nToulon and Lyons had raised the standard of revolt, Mayence gave the\r\ninvaders a passage into the heart of the kingdom, while sixty thousand\r\ninsurgents in La Vend\xc3\xa9e threatened to encamp under the walls of Paris.\r\nBut under the exertions of the Committee, and especially of Carnot,\r\nthe minister of war, still greater numbers were placed under arms,\r\nFrance was turned into an immense workshop of military preparations,\r\nand the whole property of the state, by means of confiscations and\r\nassignats, put at the disposal of the government. The immense debts of\r\nthe government were paid in paper money, while conscription filled the\r\nranks with all the youth of the state. Added to all this force which\r\nthe government had at its disposal, it must be remembered that the\r\narmy was burning with enthusiastic dreams of liberty, and of\r\npatriotism, and of glory. No wonder that such a nation of soldiers and\r\nenthusiasts should have been able to resist the armies of united\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New Constitution.]\r\n\r\nOn the death of Robespierre, (July, 1794,) a great reaction succeeded\r\nthe Reign of Terror. His old associates and tools were executed or\r\ntransported, the club of the Jacobins was closed, the Revolutionary\r\nTribunals were suppressed, the rebellious faubourgs were subdued, the\r\nNational Guard was reorganized, and a new constitution was formed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Directory.]\r\n\r\nThe constitution of 1798, framed under different influences,\r\nestablished the legislative power among two councils,--that of the\r\n_Five Hundred_, and that of the _Ancients_. The former was intrusted\r\nwith the power of originating laws; the latter had the power to reject\r\nor pass them. The executive power was intrusted to five persons,\r\ncalled _Directors_, who were nominated by the Council of Five Hundred,\r\nand approved by that of the Ancients. Each individual was to be\r\npresident by rotation during three months, and a new director was to\r\nbe chosen every year. The Directory had the entire disposal of the\r\narmy, the finances, the appointment of public functionaries, and the\r\nmanagement of public negotiations.\r\n\r\nBut there were found powerful enemies to the new constitution. Paris\r\nwas again agitated. The National Guard took part with the disaffected,\r\nand the Convention, threatened and perplexed, summoned to its aid a\r\nbody of five thousand regular troops. The National Guard mustered in\r\ngreat strength, to the number of thirty thousand men, and resolved to\r\noverawe the Convention, which was likened to the Long Parliament in\r\nthe times of Cromwell. The Convention intrusted Barras with its\r\ndefence, and he demanded, as his second in command, a young officer of\r\nartillery who had distinguished himself at the siege of Toulon. By his\r\nadvice, a powerful train of artillery was brought to Paris by a\r\nlieutenant called _Murat_. On the 4th of October, 1795, the whole\r\nneighborhood of the Tuileries resembled an intrenched camp. The\r\ncommander of the Convention then waited the attack of the insurgents,\r\nand the action soon commenced. Thirty thousand men surrounded the\r\nlittle army of six thousand, who defended the Convention and the cause\r\nof order and law. Victory inclined to the regular troops, who had the\r\nassistance of artillery, and, above all, who were animated by the\r\nspirit of their intrepid leader--_Napoleon Bonaparte_. The insurgents\r\nwere not a rabble, but the flower of French citizens; but they were\r\nforced to yield to superior military skill, and the reign of the\r\nmilitary commenced.\r\n\r\nThus closed what is technically called the French Revolution; the most\r\nawful political hurricane in the annals of modern civilized nations.\r\nIt closed, nominally, with the accession of the Directory to power,\r\nbut really with the accession of Napoleon; for, shortly after, his\r\nvictories filled the eyes of the French nation, and astonished the\r\nwhole world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reflections.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to pronounce on the effects of this great Revolution,\r\nsince a sufficient time has not yet elapsed for us to form healthy\r\njudgments. We are accustomed to associate with some of the actors\r\nevery thing that is vile and monstrous in human nature. But\r\nunmitigated monsters rarely appear on earth. The same men who excite\r\nour detestation, had they lived in quiet times might have been\r\nrespected. Even Robespierre might have retained an honorable name to\r\nhis death, as an upright judge. But the French mind was deranged. New\r\nideas had turned the brains of enthusiasts. The triumph of the\r\nabstract principles of justice seemed more desirable than the\r\npreservation of human life. The sense of injury and wrong was too\r\nvivid to allow heated partisans to make allowances for the common\r\ninfirmities of man. The enthusiasts in liberty could not see in\r\nLouis\xc2\xa0XVI. any thing but the emblem of tyranny in the worst form. They\r\nfancied that they could regenerate society by their gospel of social\r\nrights, and they overvalued the virtues of the people. But, above all,\r\nthey over-estimated themselves, and placed too light a value on the\r\nimperishable principles of revealed religion; a religion which enjoins\r\npatience and humility, as well as encourages the spirit of liberty and\r\nprogress. But whatever may have been their blunders and crimes, and\r\nhowever marked the providence of God in overruling them for the\r\nultimate good of Europe, still, all contemplative men behold in the\r\nRevolution the retributive justice of the Almighty, in humiliating a\r\nproud family of princes, and punishing a vain and oppressive nobility\r\nfor the evils they had inflicted on society.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--Alison\'s History of the French Revolution,\r\n     marked by his English prejudices, heavy in style, and\r\n     inaccurate in many of his facts, yet lofty, temperate, and\r\n     profound. Thiers\'s History is more lively, and takes\r\n     different views. Carlyle\'s work is extremely able, but the\r\n     most difficult to read of all his works, in consequence of\r\n     his affected and abominable style. Lamartine\'s History of\r\n     the Girondists is sentimental, but pleasing and instructive.\r\n     Mignet\'s History is also a standard. Lacretelle\'s Histoire\r\n     de France, and the Memoirs of Mirabeau, Necker, and\r\n     Robespierre should be read. Carlyle\'s Essays on Mirabeau and\r\n     Danton are extremely able. Burke\'s Reflections should be\r\n     read by all who wish to have the most vivid conception of\r\n     the horrors of the awful event which he deprecated. The\r\n     Annual Register should be consulted. For a general list of\r\n     authors who have written on this period, see Alison\'s index\r\n     of writers, prefixed to his great work, but which are too\r\n     numerous to be mentioned here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON BONAPARTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon Bonaparte.]\r\n\r\nMr. Alison has found it necessary to devote ten large octavo volumes\r\nto the life and times of Napoleon Bonaparte; nor can the varied events\r\nconnected with his brilliant career be satisfactorily described in\r\nfewer volumes. The limits of this work will not, however, permit a\r\nnotice extending beyond a few pages. Who, then, even among those for\r\nwhom this History is especially designed, will be satisfied with our\r\nbrief review? But only a brief allusion to very great events can be\r\nmade; for it is preposterous to attempt to condense the life of the\r\ngreatest actor on the stage of real tragedy in a single chapter. And\r\nyet there is a uniformity in nearly all of the scenes in which he\r\nappears. The history of war is ever the same--the exhibition of\r\nexcited passions, of restless ambition, of dazzling spectacles of\r\nstrife, pomp, and glory. Pillage, oppression, misery, crime, despair,\r\nruin, and death--such are the evils necessarily attendant on all war,\r\neven glorious war, when men fight for their homes, for their altars,\r\nor for great ideas. The details of war are exciting, but painful. We\r\nare most powerfully reminded of our degeneracy, of our misfortunes, of\r\nthe Great Destroyer. The "Angel Death" appears before us, in grim\r\nterrors, punishing men for crimes. But while war is so awful, and\r\nattended with all the evils of which we can conceive, or which it is\r\nthe doom of man to suffer, yet warriors are not necessarily the\r\nenemies of mankind. They are the instruments of the Almighty to\r\nscourge a wicked world, or to bring, out of disaster and suffering,\r\ngreat and permanent blessings to the human race.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Napoleon.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon is contemplated by historians in both those lights. The\r\nEnglish look upon him, generally, as an ambitious usurper, who aimed\r\nto erect a universal empire upon universal ruin; as an Alexander, a\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar, an Attila, a Charles\xc2\xa0XII. The French nation regard him almost\r\nas a deity, as a messenger of good, as a great conqueror, who fought\r\nfor light and freedom. But he was not the worst or the best of\r\nwarriors. His extraordinary and astonishing energies were called into\r\nexercise by the circumstances of the times; and he, taking advantage\r\nof both ideas and circumstances, attempted to rear a majestic throne,\r\nand advance the glory of the country, of which he made himself the\r\nabsolute ruler. His nature was not sanguinary, or cruel, or\r\nrevengeful; but few conquerors have ever committed crimes on a greater\r\nscale, or were more unscrupulous in using any means, lawful or\r\nunlawful, to accomplish a great end. Napoleon had enlightened views,\r\nand wished to advance the real interests of the French nation, but not\r\nuntil he had climbed to the summit of power, and realized all those\r\ndreams which a most inordinate ambition had excited. He doubtless\r\nrescued his country from the dangers which menaced it from foreign\r\ninvasion; but his conquests and his designs led to still greater\r\ncombinations, and these, demanding for their support the united\r\nenergies of Christendom, deluged the world with blood. Napoleon, to an\r\nextraordinary degree, realized the objects to which he had aspired;\r\nbut these were not long enjoyed, and he was hurled from his throne of\r\ngrandeur and of victory, to impress the world, which he mocked and\r\ndespised, of the vanity of military glory and the dear-earned trophies\r\nof the battle field. No man was ever permitted by Providence to\r\naccomplish so much mischief, and yet never mortal had more admirers\r\nthan he, and never were the opinions of the wise more divided in\r\nregard to the effects of his wars. A painful and sad recital may be\r\nmade of the desolations he caused, so that Alaric, in comparison,\r\nwould seem but a common robber, while, at the same time, a glorious\r\neulogium might be justly made of the many benefits he conferred upon\r\nmankind. The good and the evil are ever combined in all great\r\ncharacters; but the evil and the good are combined in him in such vast\r\nproportions, that he seems either a monster of iniquity, or an object\r\nof endless admiration. There are some characters which the eye of the\r\nmind can survey at once, as the natural eye can take in the\r\nproportions of a small but singular edifice; but Napoleon was a genius\r\nand an actor of such wonderful greatness and majesty, both from his\r\nnatural talents and the great events which he controlled, that he\r\nrises before us, when we contemplate him, like some vast pyramid or\r\nsome majestic cathedral, which the eye can survey only in details. Our\r\nage is not sufficiently removed from the times in which he lived, we\r\nare too near the object of vision, to pronounce upon the general\r\neffect of his character, and only prejudiced or vain persons would\r\nattempt to do so. He must remain for generations simply an object of\r\nawe, of wonder, of dread, of admiration, of hatred, or of love.\r\n\r\nNor can we condense the events of his life any more than we can\r\nanalyze his character and motives. We do not yet know their relative\r\nimportance. In the progress of ages, some of them will stand out more\r\nbeautiful and more remarkable, and some will be entirely lost sight\r\nof. Thousands of books will waste away as completely as if they were\r\nburned, like the Alexandrian library; and a future age may know no\r\nmore of the details of Napoleon\'s battles than we now know of\r\nAlexander\'s marches. But the main facts can never be lost; something\r\nwill remain, enough to "point a moral or adorn a tale." The object of\r\nall historical knowledge is moral wisdom, and this we may learn from\r\nnarratives as brief as the stories of Joseph and Daniel, or the\r\naccounts which Tacitus has left us of the lives of the Roman tyrants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Days of Napoleon.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte was born in Corsica, the 15th of August, 1769, of\r\nrespectable parents, and was early sent to a royal military school at\r\nBrienne. He was not distinguished for any attainments, except in\r\nmathematics; he was studious, reserved, and cold; he also exhibited an\r\ninflexible will, the great distinguishing quality of his mind. At the\r\nage of fourteen, in view of superior attainments, he was removed to\r\nthe military school at Paris, and, at the age of seventeen, received\r\nhis commission as second lieutenant in a regiment of artillery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Services to the Republic.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution broke out, Toulon, one of the arsenals of France,\r\ntook a more decided part in favor of the king and the constitution\r\nthan either Marseilles or Lyons, and invited the support of the\r\nEnglish and Spanish squadrons. The Committee of Public Safety\r\nresolved to subdue the city; and Bonaparte, even at that time a\r\nbrigadier-general, with the command of the artillery at the siege,\r\nrecommended a course which led to the capture of that important place.\r\n\r\nFor his distinguished services and talents, he was appointed second in\r\ncommand, by the National Convention, when that body was threatened and\r\noverawed by the rebellious National Guard. He saved the state and\r\ndefended the constitutional authorities, for which service he was\r\nappointed second in command of the great army of the interior, and\r\nthen general-in-chief in the place of Barras, who found his new office\r\nas director incompatible with the duties of a general.\r\n\r\nThe other directors who now enjoyed the supreme command were Reubel,\r\nLar\xc3\xa9veill\xc3\xa8re-L\xc3\xa9peaux, Le Tourneur, and Carnot. Si\xc3\xa8yes, a man of great\r\ngenius, had been elected, but had declined. Among these five men,\r\nCarnot was the only man of genius, and it was through his exertions\r\nthat France, under the Committee of Public Safety, had been saved from\r\nthe torrent of invasion. But Barras, though inferior to Carnot in\r\ngenius, had even greater influence, and it was through his favor that\r\nBonaparte received his appointments. That a young man of twenty-five\r\nshould have the command of the army of the interior, is as remarkable\r\nas the victories which subsequently showed that his elevation was not\r\nthe work of chance, but of a providential hand.\r\n\r\nThe acknowledged favorite of Barras was a young widow, by birth a\r\nCreole of the West Indies, whose husband, a general in the army of the\r\nRhine, had been guillotined during the Reign of Terror. Her name was\r\nJosephine Beauharnois; and, as a woman of sense, of warm affections,\r\nand of rare accomplishments, she won the heart of Bonaparte, and was\r\nmarried to him, March 9, 1796. Her dowry was the command of the army\r\nof Italy, which, through her influence, the young general received.\r\n\r\nThen commenced his brilliant military career. United with Josephine,\r\nwhom he loved, he rose in rank and power.\r\n\r\nThe army which Bonaparte commanded was composed of forty-two thousand\r\nmen, while the forces of the Italian states numbered one hundred and\r\nsixty thousand, and could with ease be increased to three hundred\r\nthousand. But Italian soldiers had never been able to contend with\r\neither Austrian or French, and Bonaparte felt sure of victory. His\r\nsoldiers were young men, inured to danger and toil; and among his\r\nofficers were Berthier, Massena, Marmont, Augereau, Serrurier,\r\nJoubert, Lannes, and Murat. They were not then all generals, but they\r\nbecame afterwards marshals of France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Italian Campaign.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1796, in Italy, was successful beyond precedent in the\r\nhistory of war; and the battles of Montenotte, Millesimo, and Dego,\r\nthe passage of the bridge of Lodi, the siege of Mantua, and the\r\nvictories at Castiglione, Caldiero, Arcola, Rivoli, and Mantua,\r\nextended the fame of Bonaparte throughout the world. The Austrian\r\narmies were every where defeated, and Italy was subjected to the rule\r\nof the French. "With the French invasion commenced tyranny under the\r\nname of liberty, rapine under the name of generosity, the stripping of\r\nchurches, the robbing of hospitals, the levelling of the palaces of\r\nthe great, and the destruction of the cottages of the poor; all that\r\nmilitary license has of most terrible, all that despotic authority has\r\nof most oppressive."\r\n\r\nWhile Bonaparte was subduing Italy, the French under Moreau were\r\ncontending, on the Rhine, with the Austrians under the Archduke\r\nCharles. Several great battles were fought, and masterly retreats were\r\nmade, but without decisive results.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that England, France, and the other contending\r\npowers, were able at this time to commence the contest, much more so\r\nto continue it for more than twenty years. The French Directory, on\r\nits accession to power, found the finances in a state of inextricable\r\nconfusion. Assignats had fallen to almost nothing, and taxes were\r\ncollected with such difficulty, that there were arrears to the amount\r\nof fifteen hundred millions of francs. The armies were destitute and\r\nill paid, the artillery without horses, and the infantry depressed by\r\nsuffering and defeat. In England, the government of Pitt was violently\r\nassailed for carrying on a war against a country which sought simply\r\nto revolutionize her own institutions, and which all the armies of\r\nEurope had thus far failed to subdue. Mr. Fox, and others in the\r\nopposition, urged the folly of continuing a contest which had already\r\nadded one hundred millions of pounds to the national debt, and at a\r\ntime when French armies were preparing to invade Italy; but Pitt\r\nargued that the French must be nearly exhausted by their great\r\nexertions, and would soon be unable to continue the warfare. The\r\nnation, generally, took this latter view of the case, and parliament\r\nvoted immense supplies.\r\n\r\nThe year 1797 opened gloomily for England. The French had gained\r\nimmense successes. Bonaparte had subdued Italy, Hoche had suppressed\r\nthe rebellion in La Vend\xc3\xa9e, Austria was preparing to defend her last\r\nbarriers in the passes of the Alps, Holland was virtually incorporated\r\nwith Republican France, Spain had also joined its forces, and the\r\nwhole continent was arrayed against Great Britain. England had\r\ninterfered in a contest in which she was not concerned, and was forced\r\nto reap the penalty. The funds fell from ninety-eight to fifty-one,\r\nand petitions for a change of ministers were sent to the king from\r\nalmost every city of note in the kingdom. The Bank of England stopped\r\npayment in specie, and the country was overburdened by taxation.\r\nNevertheless, parliament voted new supplies, and made immense\r\npreparations, especially for the increase of the navy. One hundred and\r\ntwenty-four ships of the line, one hundred and eighty frigates, and\r\none hundred and eighty-four sloops, were put in commission, and sent\r\nto the various quarters of the globe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of St. Vincent.]\r\n\r\nSoon after occurred the memorable mutiny in the English fleet, which\r\nproduced the utmost alarm; but it was finally suppressed by the\r\nvigorous measures which the government adopted, and the happy union of\r\nfirmness and humanity, justice and concession which Mr. Pitt\r\nexercised. The mutiny was entirely disconnected with France, and\r\nresulted from the real grievances which existed in the navy;\r\ngrievances which, to the glory of Pitt, were candidly considered and\r\npromptly redressed. The temporary disgrace which resulted to the navy\r\nby this mutiny was soon, however, wiped away by the battle of Cape St.\r\nVincent, in which Admiral Jervis, seconded by Nelson and Collingwood,\r\nwith fifteen ships of the line and six frigates, defeated a Spanish\r\nfleet of twenty-seven ships of the line and twelve frigates. This\r\nimportant naval victory delivered England from all fears of invasion,\r\nand inspired courage into the hearts of the nation, groaning under the\r\nheavy taxes which the war increased. Before the season closed, the\r\nDutch fleet, of fifteen ships of the line and eleven frigates, was\r\ndefeated by an English one, under Admiral Duncan, consisting of\r\nsixteen ships of the line and three frigates. The battles of\r\nCamperdown and Cape St. Vincent, in which the genius of Duncan and\r\nNelson were signally exhibited, were among the most important fought\r\nat sea during the war, and diffused unexampled joy throughout Great\r\nBritain. The victors were all rewarded. Jervis became Earl St.\r\nVincent, Admiral Duncan became a viscount, and Commodore Nelson became\r\na baronet. Soon after the bonfires and illuminations for these\r\nvictories were ended, Mr. Burke died urging, as his end approached,\r\nthe ministry to persevere in the great struggle to which the nation\r\nwas committed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conquest of Venice by Napoleon.]\r\n\r\nWhile the English were victorious on the water, the French obtained\r\nnew triumphs on the land. In twenty days after the opening of the\r\ncampaign of 1797, Bonaparte had driven the Archduke Charles, with an\r\narmy equal to his own, over the Julian Alps, and occupied Carniola,\r\nCarinthia, Trieste, Fiume, and the Italian Tyrol, while a force of\r\nforty-five thousand men, flushed with victory, was on the northern\r\ndeclivity of the Alps, within fifty leagues of Vienna. In the midst of\r\nthese successes, an insurrection broke out in the Venetian\r\nterritories; and, as Bonaparte was not supported, as he expected, by\r\nthe Armies of the Rhine, and partly in consequence of the jealousy of\r\nthe Directory, he resolved to forego all thoughts of dictating peace\r\nunder the walls of Vienna, and contented himself with making as\r\nadvantageous terms as possible with the Austrian government. Bonaparte\r\naccomplished his object, and directed his attention to the subjugation\r\nof Venice, no longer the "Queen of the Adriatic, throned on her\r\nhundred isles," but degenerate, weakened, and divided. Bonaparte\r\nacted, in his treaty with Austria, with great injustice to Venice, and\r\nalso encouraged the insurrection of the people in her territories. And\r\nwhen the Venetian government attempted to suppress rebellion in its\r\nown provinces, Bonaparte affected great indignation, and soon found\r\nmeans to break off all negotiations. The Venetian senate made every\r\neffort to avert the storm, but in vain. Bonaparte declared war against\r\nVenice, and her fall soon after resulted. The French seized all the\r\ntreasure they could find, and obliged the ruined capital to furnish\r\nheavy contributions, and surrender its choicest works of art. Soon\r\nafter, the youthful conqueror established himself in the beautiful\r\nchateau of Montebello near Milan, and there dictated peace to the\r\nassembled ambassadors of Germany, Rome, Genoa, Venice, Naples,\r\nPiedmont, and the Swiss republic. The treaty of Campo Formio exhibited\r\nboth the strength and the perfidy of Bonaparte, especially in\r\nreference to Venice, which was disgracefully despoiled to pay the\r\nexpenses of the Italian wars. Among other things, the splendid bronze\r\nhorses, which, for six hundred years, had stood over the portico of\r\nthe church of St. Mark, to commemorate the capture of Constantinople\r\nby the Venetian crusaders, and which had originally been brought from\r\nCorinth to Rome by ancient conquerors, were removed to Paris to\r\ndecorate the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nBonaparte\'s journey from Italy to Paris, after Venice, with its\r\nbeautiful provinces, was surrendered to Austria, was a triumphal\r\nprocession. The enthusiasm of the Parisians was boundless; the public\r\ncuriosity to see him indescribable. But he lived in a quiet manner,\r\nand assumed the dress of a member of the Institute, being lately\r\nelected. Great _f\xc3\xaates_ were given to his honor, and his victories were\r\nmagnified.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Invasion of Egypt.]\r\n\r\nBut he was not content with repose or adulation. His ambitious soul\r\npanted for new conquests, and he conceived the scheme of his Egyptian\r\ninvasion, veiled indeed from the eyes of the world by a pretended\r\nattack on England herself. He was invested, with great pomp, by the\r\nDirectory, with the command of the army of England, but easily induced\r\nthe government to sanction the invasion of Egypt. It is not probable\r\nthat Bonaparte seriously contemplated the conquest of England, knowing\r\nthe difficulty of supporting and recruiting his army, even if he\r\nsucceeded in landing his forces. He probably designed to divert the\r\nattention of the English from his projected enterprise.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, Bonaparte (9th May) embarked at Toulon in a fleet\r\nof thirteen ships of the line, fourteen frigates, seventy-two brigs,\r\nand four hundred transports, containing thirty-six thousand soldiers\r\nand ten thousand sailors. He was joined by reinforcements at Genoa,\r\nAjaccio, Civita Castellana, and on the 10th of June arrived at Malta,\r\nwhich capitulated without firing a shot; proceeded on his voyage,\r\nsucceeded in escaping the squadron of Nelson, and on the 1st of July\r\nreached Alexandria. He was vigorously opposed by the Mamelukes, who\r\nwere the actual rulers of the country, but advanced in spite of them\r\nto Cairo, and marched along the banks of the Nile. Near the Pyramids,\r\na great battle took place, and the Mamelukes were signally defeated,\r\nand the fate of Egypt was sealed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Acre.]\r\n\r\nBut Nelson got intelligence of Bonaparte\'s movements, and resolved to\r\n"gain a peerage, or a grave in Westminster Abbey." Then succeeded the\r\nbattle of the Nile, and the victory of Nelson, one of the most\r\nbrilliant but bloody actions in the history of naval warfare. Nelson\r\nwas wounded, but gained a peerage and magnificent presents. The battle\r\nwas a mortal stroke to the French army, and made the conquest of Egypt\r\nuseless. Bonaparte found his army exiled, and himself destined to\r\nhopeless struggles with Oriental powers. But he made gigantic efforts,\r\nin order to secure the means of support, to prosecute scientific\r\nresearches, and to complete the conquest of the country. He crossed\r\nthe desert which separates Africa from Asia, with his army, which did\r\nnot exceed sixteen thousand men, invaded Syria, stormed Jaffa,\r\nmassacred its garrison, since he could not afford to support the\r\nprisoners,--a most barbarous measure, and not to be excused even in\r\nview of the policy of the act,--and then advanced to Acre. Its\r\nmemorable siege in the time of the Crusades should have deterred\r\nBonaparte from the attempt to subdue it with his little army in the\r\nmidst of a hostile population. But he made the attack. The fortress,\r\nsuccored by Sir Sidney Smith, successfully resisted the impetuosity of\r\nhis troops, and they were compelled to retire with the loss of three\r\nthousand men. His discomfited army retreated to Egypt, and suffered\r\nall the accumulated miseries which fatigue, heat, thirst, plague, and\r\nfamine could inflict. He, however, amidst all these calamities, added\r\nto discontents among the troops, won the great battle of Aboukir, and\r\nimmediately after, leaving the army under the command of Kleber,\r\nreturned to Alexandria, and secretly set sail for France, accompanied\r\nby Berthier, Lannes, Murat, Marmont, and other generals. He succeeded\r\nin escaping the English cruisers, and, on the 8th of October, 1799,\r\nlanded in France.\r\n\r\nBonaparte, had he not been arrested at Acre by Sir Sidney Smith,\r\nprobably would have conquered Asia Minor, and established an Oriental\r\nempire; but such a conquest would not have been permanent. More\r\nbrilliant victories were in reserve for him than conquering troops of\r\nhalf-civilized Turks and Arabs.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of Bonaparte in Egypt, the French Directory became\r\nunpopular, and the national finances more embarrassed than ever. But\r\nSwitzerland was invaded and conquered--an outrage which showed the\r\nambitious designs of the government more than any previous attack\r\nwhich it had made on the liberties of Europe. The Papal States were\r\nnext seized, the venerable pontiff was subjected to cruel indignities,\r\nand the treasures and monuments of Rome were again despoiled. "The\r\nVatican was stripped to its naked walls, and the immortal frescoes of\r\nRaphael and Michael Angelo alone remained in solitary beauty amidst\r\nthe general desolation." The King of Sardinia was driven from his\r\ndominions, and Naples yielded to the tricolored flag. Immense military\r\ncontributions were levied in all these unfortunate states, and all\r\nthat was beautiful in art was transported to Paris.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reverses of the French.]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the spirits of the English were revived by the\r\nvictories of Nelson, and greater preparations than ever were made to\r\nresist the general, who now plainly aimed at the conquest of Europe.\r\nEngland, Austria, and Russia combined against France and her armies\r\nmet with reverses in Italy and on the Rhine. Suwarrow, with a large\r\narmy of Russians united with Austrians gained considerable success,\r\nand General Moreau was obliged to retreat before him. Serrurier\r\nsurrendered with seven thousand men, and Suwarrow entered Milan in\r\ntriumph, with sixty thousand troops. Turin shared the fate of Milan,\r\nand Piedmont and Lombardy were overrun by the allies. The republicans\r\nwere expelled from Naples. Mantua fell, and Suwarrow marched with his\r\nconquering legions into Switzerland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon First Consul.]\r\n\r\nThese disasters happened while Bonaparte was in Egypt; and his return\r\nto France was hailed with universal joy. His victories in Egypt had\r\nprepared the way for a most enthusiastic reception, and for his\r\nassumption of the sovereign power. All the generals then in Paris paid\r\ntheir court to him, and his saloon, in his humble dwelling in the Rue\r\nChantereine, resembled the court of a monarch. Lannes, Murat,\r\nBerthier, Jourdan, Augereau, Macdonald, Bournonville, Leclerc,\r\nLefebvre, and Marmont, afterwards so illustrious as the marshals of\r\nthe emperor, offered him the military dictatorship, while Si\xc3\xa8yes,\r\nTalleyrand, and R\xc3\xa9gnier, the great civil leaders, concurred to place\r\nhim at the head of affairs. He himself withdrew from the gaze of the\r\npeople, affected great simplicity, and associated chiefly with men\r\ndistinguished for literary and scientific attainments. But he secretly\r\nintrigued with Si\xc3\xa8yes and with his generals. Three of the Directory\r\nsent in their resignations, and Napoleon assumed the reins of\r\ngovernment under the title of _First Consul_, and was associated with\r\nSi\xc3\xa8yes and Roger Ducos. The legislative branches of the government\r\nresisted, but the Council of Five Hundred was powerless before the\r\nbayonets of the military. A new revolution was effected, and despotic\r\npower in the hands of a military chieftain commenced. He, however,\r\nsignalized himself by the clemency he showed in the moment of victory,\r\nand the principles of humanity, even in the government of a military\r\ndespot, triumphed over the principles of cruelty. Bonaparte chose able\r\nmen to assist him in the government. Talleyrand was made minister of\r\nforeign affairs. Fouch\xc3\xa9 retained his portfolio of police, and the\r\ncelebrated La Place was made minister of the interior. On the 24th of\r\nDecember, 1799, the new constitution was proclaimed; and, shortly\r\nafter, Si\xc3\xa8yes and Roger Ducos withdrew from the consulate, and gave\r\nplace to Cambac\xc3\xa8res and Lebrun, who were in the interests of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe first step of the first consul was to offer peace to Great\r\nBritain; and he wrote a letter to the king, couched in his peculiar\r\nstyle of mock philanthropy and benevolence, in which he spoke of peace\r\nas the first necessity and truest glory of nations! Lord Grenville,\r\nminister of foreign affairs, replied in a long letter, in which he\r\nlaid upon France the blame of the war, in consequence of her\r\nrevolutionary principles and aggressive spirit, and refused to make\r\npeace while the causes of difficulty remained; in other words, until\r\nthe Bourbon dynasty was restored. The Commons supported the government\r\nby a large majority, and all parties prepared for a still more\r\ndesperate conflict. Napoleon was obliged to fight, and probably\r\ndesired to fight, feeling that his power and the greatness of his\r\ncountry would depend upon the victories he might gain; that so long as\r\nthe _\xc3\xa9clat_ of his government continued, his government would be\r\nstrong. Mr. Pitt was probably right in his opinion that no peace could\r\nbe lasting with a revolutionary power, and that every successive peace\r\nwould only pave the way for fresh aggressions. Bonaparte could only\r\nfulfil what he called his destiny, by continual agitation; and this\r\nwas well understood by himself and by his enemies. The contest had\r\nbecome one of life and death; and both parties resolved that no peace\r\nshould be made until one or the other was effectually conquered The\r\nland forces of Great Britain, at the commencement of the year 1800,\r\namounted to one hundred and sixty-eight thousand men, exclusive of\r\neighty thousand militia, while one hundred and twenty thousand seamen\r\nand marines were voted. The ships in commission were no less than five\r\nhundred, including one hundred and twenty-four of the line. The\r\ncharter of the Bank of England was renewed, and the union with Ireland\r\neffected. The various German states made still greater exertions, and\r\nagreed to raise a contingent force of three hundred thousand men. They\r\nwere greatly assisted in this measure by subsidies from Great Britain.\r\nAustria, alone, had in the field at this time a force of two hundred\r\nthousand men, half of whom belonged to the army of Italy under Melas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immense Military Preparations.]\r\n\r\nTo make head against the united forces of England and Austria, with a\r\ndefeated army, an exhausted treasury, and a disunited people, was the\r\ndifficult task of Bonaparte. His first object was to improve the\r\nfinances; his second, to tranquillize La Vend\xc3\xa9e; his third, to detach\r\nRussia from the allies; his fourth, to raise armies equal to the\r\ncrisis; and all these measures he rapidly accomplished. One hundred\r\nand twenty thousand men were raised by conscription, without any\r\nexemption from either rank or fortune, and two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand men were ready to commence hostilities. The first consul\r\nsuppressed the liberty of the press, fixed his residence in the\r\nTuileries, and established the usages and ceremonial of a court. He\r\nrevoked the sentence of banishment on illustrious individuals,\r\nestablished a secret police, and constructed the gallery of the\r\nLouvre.\r\n\r\nHostilities commenced in Germany, and General Moreau was successful\r\nover General Kray at the battles of Engen, Moeskirch, and Biberach.\r\nGeneral Massena fought with great courage in the Maritime Alps, but\r\nwas obliged to retreat before superior forces, and shut himself up in\r\nGenoa, which endured a dreadful siege, but was finally compelled to\r\nsurrender. The victor, Melas, then set out to meet Bonaparte himself,\r\nwho was invading Italy, and had just effected his wonderful passage\r\nover the Alps by the Great St. Bernard, one of the most wonderful\r\nfeats in the annals of war; for his artillery and baggage had to be\r\ntransported over one of the highest and most difficult passes of the\r\nAlps. The passes of the St. Gothard and Mount Cenis were also effected\r\nby the wings of the army. The first action was at Montebello, which\r\nended in favor of the French; and this was soon followed by a decisive\r\nand brilliant victory at Marengo, (June 14,) one of the most\r\nobstinately contested during the war, and which was attended with\r\ngreater results than perhaps any battle that had yet occurred in\r\nmodern warfare. Moreau also gained a great victory over the Austrians\r\nat Hohenlinden, and Macdonald performed great exploits amid the\r\nmountains of the Italian Tyrol. The treaty of Lun\xc3\xa9ville, (February 9,\r\n1801,) in consequence of the victorious career of Bonaparte, ceded to\r\nFrance the possession of Belgium, and the whole left bank of the\r\nRhine. Lombardy was erected into an independent state, Venice was\r\nrestored to Austria, and the independence of the Batavian, Helvetic,\r\nCisalpine, and Ligurian republics was guaranteed. This peace excited\r\nunbounded joy at Paris, and was the first considerable pause in the\r\ncontinental strife.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Reforms of Napoleon.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon returned to his capital to reconstruct society, which was\r\nentirely disorganized. It was his object to restore the institutions\r\nof religion, law, commerce, and education. He did not attempt to give\r\nconstitutional freedom. This was impracticable; but he did desire to\r\nbring order out of confusion. One night, going to the theatre, he\r\nnarrowly escaped death by the explosion of an "infernal machine." He\r\nattributed the design of assassination to the Jacobins, and forthwith\r\ntransported one hundred and thirty of them, more as a statesman than\r\nas a judge. He was determined to break up that obnoxious party, and\r\nthe design against his life furnished the pretence. Shortly after, he\r\ninstituted the Legion of Honor, an order of merit which was designed\r\nto restore gradually the gradation in the ranks of society. He was\r\nviolently opposed, but he carried his measures through the Council of\r\nState; and this institution, which at length numbered two thousand\r\npersons, civil and military, became both popular and useful. He then\r\nrestored the external institution of religion, and ten archbishops and\r\nfifty bishops administered the affairs of the Gallican Church. The\r\nrestoration of the Sunday, with its customary observances, was hailed\r\nby the peasantry with undisguised delight, and was a pleasing sight to\r\nthe nations of Europe. He then contemplated the complete restoration\r\nof all the unalienated national property to the original proprietors,\r\nbut was forced to abandon the design. A general amnesty, was also\r\nproclaimed to emigrants, by which one hundred thousand people\r\nreturned, not to enjoy their possessions, but to recover a part of\r\nthem, and breathe the air of their native land. At last, he resolved\r\nto make himself first consul for life, and seat his family on a\r\nmonarchical throne. He was opposed by the Council of State; but he\r\nappealed to the people, and three million three hundred and\r\nsixty-eight thousand two hundred and nine, out of three million five\r\nhundred and fifty-seven thousand eight hundred and eighty-five\r\nelectors, voted for his elevation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Code Napol\xc3\xa9on.]\r\n\r\nThe "_Code Napol\xc3\xa9on_" then occupied his attention, indisputably the\r\ngreatest monument of his reign, and the most beneficial event of his\r\nage. All classes and parties have praised the wisdom of this great\r\ncompilation, which produced more salutary changes than had been\r\neffected by all the early revolutionists. Amid these great\r\nundertakings of the consul, the internal prosperity of France was\r\nconstantly increasing, and education, art, and science received an\r\nimmense impulse. Every thing seemed to smile upon Bonaparte, and all\r\nappeared reconciled to the great power which he exercised.\r\n\r\nBut there were some of his generals who were attached to republican\r\nprinciples, and viewed with ill-suppressed jealousy the rapid strides\r\nhe was making to imperial power. Moreau, the victor at Hohenlinden,\r\nwas at the head of these, and, in conjunction with Fouch\xc3\xa9, who had\r\nbeen turned out of his office on account of the immense power which it\r\ngave him, formed a conspiracy of republicans and royalists to overturn\r\nthe consular throne. But Fouch\xc3\xa9 revealed the plot to Bonaparte, who\r\nrestored him to power, and Generals Moreau and Pichegru, the Duke\r\nd\'Enghien, and other illustrious persons were arrested. The duke\r\nhimself was innocent of the conspiracy, but was sacrificed to the\r\njealousy of Bonaparte, who wished to remove from the eyes of the\r\npeople this illustrious scion of the Bourbon family, the only member\r\nof it he feared. This act was one of the most cruel and unjustifiable,\r\nand therefore, impolitic, which Bonaparte ever committed. "It was\r\nworse than a crime," said Talleyrand; "it was a blunder." His murder\r\nagain lighted the flames of continental war, and from it may be dated\r\nthe commencement of that train of events which ultimately hurled\r\nNapoleon from the imperial throne.\r\n\r\nThat possession was what his heart now coveted, and he therefore\r\nseized what he desired, and what he had power to retain. On the 18th\r\nof May, 1804, Napoleon was declared Emperor of the French, and an\r\noverwhelming majority of the electoral votes of France confirmed him\r\nin his usurpation of the throne of Hugh Capet.\r\n\r\nHis first step, as emperor, was the creation of eighteen marshals, all\r\nmemorable in the annals of military glory--Berthier, Murat, Moncey,\r\nJourdan, Massena, Augereau, Bernadotte, Soult, Brune, Lannes, Mortier,\r\nNey, Davoust, Bessi\xc3\xa8res, Kellermann, Lefebvre, P\xc3\xa9rignon, and\r\nSerrurier. The individual lives of these military heroes cannot here\r\nbe alluded to.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1805, the great powers of England, Austria, and\r\nRussia entered into a coalition to reduce France to its ancient\r\nlimits, and humble the despot who had usurped the throne. Enormous\r\npreparations were made by all the belligerent states, and four hundred\r\nthousand men were furnished by the allies for active service; a force\r\nnot, however, much larger than Napoleon raised to prosecute his scheme\r\nof universal dominion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meditated Invasion of England.]\r\n\r\nAmong other designs, he meditated the invasion of England itself, and\r\nassembled for that purpose one of the most splendid armies which had\r\nbeen collected since the days of the Roman legions. It amounted to one\r\nhundred and fourteen thousand men, four hundred and thirty-two pieces\r\nof cannon, and fourteen thousand six hundred and fifty-four horses.\r\nAmple transports were provided to convey this immense army to the\r\nshores of England. But the English government took corresponding means\r\nof defence, having fathomed the designs of the enemy, who had\r\nsucceeded in securing the co\xc3\xb6peration of Spain. This great design of\r\nNapoleon was defeated by the vigilance of the English, and the number\r\nof British ships which defended the coasts--the "wooden walls" which\r\npreserved England from a most imminent and dreaded danger.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Austerlitz.]\r\n\r\nFrustrated in the attempt to invade Great Britain, Napoleon instantly\r\nconceived the plan of the campaign of Austerlitz, and without delay\r\ngave orders for the march of his different armies to the banks of the\r\nDanube. The army of England on the shores of the Channel, the forces\r\nin Holland, and the troops in Hanover were formed into seven corps,\r\nunder the command of as many marshals, comprising altogether one\r\nhundred and ninety thousand men, while the troops of his allies in\r\nItaly and Germany amounted to nearly seventy thousand more. Eighty\r\nthousand new conscripts were also raised, and all of these were\r\ndesigned for the approaching conflict with the Austrians.\r\n\r\nBut before the different armies could meet together in Germany, Nelson\r\nhad gained the great and ever-memorable victory of Trafalgar, (October\r\n23,) on the coast of Spain, by which the naval power of France and\r\nSpain was so crippled and weakened, that England remained, during the\r\ncontinuance of the war, sovereign mistress of the ocean. Nothing could\r\nexceed the transports of exultation which pervaded the British empire\r\non the news of this great naval victory--perhaps the greatest in the\r\nannals of war. And all that national gratitude could prompt was done\r\nin honor of Nelson. The remains of the fallen victor were buried in\r\nSt. Paul\'s Cathedral, over which a magnificent monument was erected.\r\nHis brother, who inherited his title, was made an earl, with a grant\r\nof six thousand pounds a year, and an estate worth one hundred\r\nthousand pounds. Admiral Collingwood, the second in command, was\r\nraised to the peerage, with a grant of two thousand pounds yearly. But\r\nthe thoughts of the nation were directed to the departed hero, and\r\ncountless and weeping multitudes followed him to the grave; and his\r\nmemory has ever since been consecrated in the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen, who regard him, and with justice, as the greatest naval\r\ncommander whom any nation or age has produced.\r\n\r\nEarly in October, the forces of Napoleon were marshalled on the plains\r\nof Germany, and the Austrians, under the Archduke Charles, acted on\r\nthe defensive. Napoleon advanced rapidly on Vienna, seized the bridge\r\nwhich led from it to the northern provinces of the empire, passed\r\nthrough the city, and established his head-quarters at Schoenbrunn. On\r\nthe 1st of December was fought the celebrated battle of Austerlitz,\r\nthe most glorious of all Napoleon\'s battles, and in which his military\r\ngenius shone with the greatest lustre, and which decided the campaign.\r\nNegotiations with Austria, dictated by the irresistible power of the\r\nFrench emperor, were soon concluded at Presburg, (27th December,) by\r\nwhich that ancient state was completely humbled. The dethronement of\r\nthe King of Naples followed, and the power of Napoleon was\r\nconsolidated on the continent of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Austerlitz was a great blow to the allied powers, and\r\nthe health and spirits of Pitt sunk under the disastrous intelligence.\r\nA devouring fever seized his brain, and delirium quenched the fire of\r\nhis genius. He died on the 23d of January, 1806, at the age of\r\nforty-seven, with the exclamation, "Alas, my country!" after having\r\nnobly guided the British bark in the most stormy times his nation had\r\nwitnessed since the age of Cromwell. He was buried with great pomp in\r\nWestminster Abbey, and died in debt, after having the control, for so\r\nmany years, of the treasury of England. Mr. Fox did not long survive\r\nhis more illustrious rival, but departed from the scene of conflict\r\nand of glory the 13th of September.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Jena.]\r\n\r\nThe humiliation of Prussia succeeded that of Austria. The battle of\r\nJena, the 14th of October, prostrated, in a single day, the strength\r\nof the Prussian monarchy, and did what the united armies of Austria,\r\nRussia, and France could not accomplish by the Seven Years\' War.\r\nNapoleon followed up his victories by bold and decisive measures,\r\ninvested Magdeburg, which was soon abandoned, entered Berlin in\r\ntriumph, and levied enormous contributions on the kingdom, to the\r\namount of one hundred and fifty-nine millions of francs. In less than\r\nseven weeks, three hundred and fifty standards, four thousand pieces\r\nof cannon, and eighty thousand prisoners were taken; while only\r\nfifteen thousand, out of one hundred and twenty thousand men, were\r\nable to follow the standards of the conquered king to the banks of the\r\nVistula. Alarm, as well as despondency, now seized all the nations of\r\nEurope. All the coalitions which had been made to suppress a\r\nrevolutionary state had failed, and the proudest monarchs of\r\nChristendom were suppliant at the feet of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Frederic William sued for peace; but such hard\r\nconditions were imposed by the haughty conqueror at Berlin, that the\r\nKing of Prussia prepared for further resistance, especially in view of\r\nthe fact that the Russians were coming to his assistance At Berlin,\r\nNapoleon issued his celebrated decrees against British commerce,\r\nwhich, however, flourished in spite of them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon Aggrandizes France.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon then advanced into Poland to meet the Russian armies, and at\r\nEylau, on the 8th of February, 1807, was fought a bloody battle, in\r\nwhich fifty thousand men perished. It was indecisive, but had the\r\neffect of checking the progress of the French armies. But Napoleon\r\nordered new conscriptions, and made unusual exertions, so that he soon\r\nhad two hundred and eighty thousand men between the Vistula and Memel.\r\nNew successes attended the French armies, which resulted in a peace\r\nwith Russia, at Tilsit, on the river Niemen, at which place Napoleon\r\nhad a personal interview with the Emperor Alexander and the King of\r\nPrussia. By this treaty, (7th July,) Poland was erected into a\r\nseparate principality, and the general changes which Napoleon had made\r\nin Europe were ratified by the two monarchs. Soon after, Napoleon,\r\nhaving subdued resistance on the continent of Europe, returned to his\r\ncapital. He was now at the height of his fame and power, but on an\r\nelevation so high that his head became giddy. Moreover, his elevation,\r\nat the expense of Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Prussia,\r\nSaxony, and Russia, to say nothing of inferior powers, excited the\r\nenvy and the hatred of all over whom he had triumphed, and prepared\r\nthe way for new intrigues and coalitions.\r\n\r\nNapoleon after the peace of Tilsit, devoted all his energies to the\r\npreservation of his power and to the improvement of his country, and\r\nexpected of his numerous subjects the most implicit obedience to his\r\nwill. He looked upon himself as having received a commission from\r\nHeaven to rule and to reign as absolute monarch of a vast empire, as a\r\nbeing upon whom the fate of France depended. The watchwords "liberty,"\r\n"equality," "fraternity," "the public welfare," were heard no more,\r\nand gave place to others which equally flattered the feelings of the\r\nFrench people--"the interests of the empire," "the splendor of the\r\nimperial throne." From him emanated all glory and power, and the whole\r\nstructure of the state, executive, judicial, and legislative, depended\r\nupon his will. Freedom, in the eyes of the people, was succeeded by\r\nglory, and the _\xc3\xa9clat_ of victory was more highly prized than any\r\nfictitious liberty. The _Code Napol\xc3\xa9on_ rapidly progressed; schools of\r\nscience were improved; arts, manufactures, and agriculture revived.\r\nGreat monuments were reared to gratify the national pride and\r\nperpetuate the glory of conquests. The dignity of the imperial throne\r\nwas splendidly maintained, and the utmost duties of etiquette were\r\nobserved. He encouraged amusements, festivities, and _f\xc3\xaates_; and\r\nTalma, the actor, as well as artists and scholars, received his\r\npersonal regard. But his reforms and his policy had reference chiefly\r\nto the conversion of France into a nation of soldiers; and his system\r\nof conscription secured him vast and disciplined armies, not animated,\r\nas were the soldiers of the revolution, by the spirit of liberty, but\r\ntransformed into mechanical forces. The time was to come, in spite of\r\nthe military enthusiasm of his veteran soldiers, when it was to be\r\nproved that the throne of absolutism is better sustained by love than\r\nby mechanism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aggrandizement of Napoleon\'s Family.]\r\n\r\nNapoleon had already elevated his two brothers, Louis and Joseph, to\r\nthe thrones of Holland and Naples. He now sought to make his brother\r\nJoseph the King of Spain. He availed himself of a quarrel between King\r\nCharles and his son; acted as mediator, in the same sense that\r\nHastings and Clive acted as mediators in the quarrels of Indian\r\nprinces; and prepared to seize, not to humble, one of the oldest and\r\nproudest monarchies of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe details of that long war on the Spanish peninsula, which resulted\r\nfrom the appointment of Joseph Bonaparte to the throne of Spain, have\r\nbeen most admirably traced by Napier, in the best military history\r\nthat has been written in modern times. The great hero of that war was\r\nWellington; and, though he fought under the greatest disadvantages and\r\nagainst superior forces,--though unparalleled sufferings and miseries\r\nensued among all the belligerent forces,--still he succeeded in\r\nturning the tide of French conquest.\r\n\r\nSpain did not fall without a struggle. The Spanish Juntas adopted all\r\nthe means of defence in their power; and the immortal defence of\r\nSaragossa, the capital of Arragon, should have taught the imperial\r\nrobber that the Spanish spirit, though degenerate, was not yet\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nIt became almost the universal wish of the English to afford the\r\nSpaniards every possible assistance in their honorable struggle, and\r\nSir Arthur Wellesley, the conqueror of the Mahrattas, landed in\r\nPortugal in August, 1808. He was immediately opposed by Marshal Junot.\r\nNapoleon could not be spared to defend in person the throne of his\r\nbrother, but his most illustrious marshals were sent into the field;\r\nand, shortly after, the battle of Corunna was fought, at which Sir\r\nJohn Moore, one of the bravest of generals, was killed in the moment\r\nof victory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Peninsular War.]\r\n\r\nLong and disastrous was that Peninsular war. Before it could be\r\nclosed, Napoleon was called to make new exertions. Austria had again\r\ndeclared war, and the forces which she raised were gigantic. Five\r\nhundred and fifty thousand men, in different armies, were put under\r\nthe command of the Archduke Charles. Napoleon advanced against him,\r\nand was again successful, at Abensberg and at Eckmuhl. Again he\r\noccupied Vienna; but its fall did not discourage the Austrians, who,\r\nsoon after, were marshalled against the French at Wagram, which\r\ndreadful battle made Napoleon once more the conqueror of Austria. On\r\nthe 14th of November, 1809, he returned to Paris, and soon after made\r\nthe grand mistake of his life.\r\n\r\nHe resolved to divorce Josephine, whom he loved and respected; a woman\r\nfully worthy of his love, and of the exalted position to which she was\r\nraised. But she had no children, and Napoleon wanted an heir to the\r\nuniversal empire which he sought to erect on the ruins of the ancient\r\nmonarchies of Europe. The dream of Charlemagne and of Charles\xc2\xa0V. was\r\nhis, also--the revival of the great Western Empire. Moreover, Napoleon\r\nsought a domestic alliance with the proud family of the German\r\nemperor. He sought, by this, to gratify his pride and strengthen his\r\nthrone. He perhaps also contemplated, with the Emperor of Austria for\r\nhis father and ally, the easy conquest of Russia. Alexander so\r\nsupposed. "His next task," said he, "will be to drive me back to my\r\nforests."\r\n\r\nThe Empress Josephine heard of the intentions of Napoleon with\r\nindescribable anguish, but submitted to his will; thus sacrificing her\r\nhappiness to what she was made to believe would advance the welfare of\r\nher country and the interests of that heartless conqueror whom she\r\nnevertheless loved with unparalleled devotion. On the 11th of March,\r\n1810, the espousals of Napoleon and Maria Louisa were celebrated at\r\nVienna, the person of the former being represented by his favorite\r\nBerthier. A few days afterwards she set out for France; and her\r\nmarriage, in a domestic point of view, was happy. Josephine had the\r\nadvantage over her in art and grace, but she was superior in the\r\ncharms of simplicity and modesty. "It is singular," says Sir Walter\r\nScott, "that the artificial character should have belonged to the\r\ndaughter of a West India planter; that, marked by nature and\r\nsimplicity, to a princess of the proudest court in Europe."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War in Spain.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the war in Spain was prosecuted, and Napoleon was master of\r\nits richest and most powerful provinces. Seventy-five thousand men in\r\nAndalusia, under Soult; fifty thousand under Marmont, in Leon; sixty\r\nthousand under Bessi\xc3\xa8res, at Valladolid and Biscay; forty-five\r\nthousand under Macdonald, at Gerona, to guard Catalonia; thirty\r\nthousand under Suchet, twenty thousand under Joseph and Jourdan,\r\nfifteen thousand under R\xc3\xa9gnier, besides many more thousand troops in\r\nthe various garrisons,--in all over three hundred thousand men,--held\r\nSpain in military subjection. Against these immense forces, marshalled\r\nunder the greatest generals of France, Spain and her allies could\r\noppose only about ninety thousand men, for the most part ill\r\ndisciplined and equipped.\r\n\r\nThe vital point of resistance was to be found shut up within the walls\r\nof Cadiz, which made a successful defence. But Tortosa, Tarragona,\r\nSaguntum, and Valentia, after making most desperate resistance, fell.\r\nBut Wellington gained, on the other hand, the great battle of Albuera,\r\none of the bloodiest ever fought, and which had a great effect in\r\nraising the spirits of his army and of the Spaniards. The tide of\r\nFrench conquest was arrested, and the English learned from their\r\nenemies those arts of war which had hitherto made Napoleon triumphant.\r\n\r\nIn the next campaign of 1812, new successes were obtained by\r\nWellington, and against almost overwhelming difficulties. He renewed\r\nthe siege of Badajoz, and carried this frontier fortress, which\r\nenabled him now to act on the offensive, and to enter the Spanish\r\nterritories. The fall of Ciudad Rodrigo was attended with the same\r\nimportant consequences. Wellington now aimed to reduce the French\r\nforce on the Peninsula, although vastly superior to his own. He had\r\nonly sixty thousand men; but, with this force, he invaded Spain,\r\ndefended by three hundred thousand. Salamanca was the first place of\r\nconsequence which fell: Marmont was totally defeated. Wellington\r\nadvanced to Madrid, which he entered the 12th of August, amid the\r\nenthusiastic shouts of the Spanish population. Soult was obliged to\r\nraise the siege of Cadiz, abandon Andalusia, and hasten to meet the\r\ngreat English general, who had turned the tide of French aggression.\r\nWellington was compelled, of course, to retire before the immense\r\nforces which were marching against him, and fell back to Salamanca,\r\nand afterwards to Ciudad Rodrigo. The campaign, on the part of the\r\nEnglish, is memorable in the annals of successful war, and the French\r\npower was effectually weakened, if it was not destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Invasion of Russia.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these successes, Napoleon prepared for his disastrous\r\ninvasion of Russia; the most gigantic and most unfortunate expedition\r\nin the whole history of war.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was probably induced to invade Russia in order to keep up the\r\nsuccession of victories. He felt that, to be secure, he must advance;\r\nthat, the moment he sought repose, his throne would begin to totter;\r\nthat nothing would sustain the enthusiasm of his countrymen but new\r\ntriumphs, commensurate with his greatness and fame. Some, however,\r\ndissuaded him from the undertaking, not only because it was plainly\r\naggressive and unnecessary, but because it was impolitic. Three\r\nhundred thousand men were fighting in Spain to establish his family on\r\nthe throne of the Bourbons, and the rest of Europe was watching his\r\ncourse, with the intention of assailing him so soon as he should meet\r\nwith misfortunes.\r\n\r\nBut neither danger nor difficulty deterred Napoleon from the\r\ncommission of a gigantic crime, for which no reasonable apology could\r\nbe given, and which admits of no palliation. He made, however, a\r\nfearful mistake, and his rapid downfall was the result. Providence\r\npermitted him to humble the powers of Europe, but did not design that\r\nhe should be permanently aggrandized by their misfortunes.\r\n\r\nThe forces of all the countries he had subdued were marshalled with\r\nthe French in this dreadful expedition, and nothing but enthusiasm was\r\nexcited in all the dominions of the empire. The army of invasion\r\namounted to above five hundred thousand men, only two hundred thousand\r\nof whom were native French. To oppose this enormous force, the\r\nRussians collected about three hundred thousand men; but Napoleon felt\r\nsecure of victory.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Niemen he reviewed the principal corps of his\r\narmy, collected from so many countries, and for the support of which\r\nthey were obliged to contribute. On the 24th of June, he and his hosts\r\ncrossed the river; and never, probably, in the history of man, was\r\nexhibited a more splendid and imposing scene.\r\n\r\nThe Russians retreated as the allied armies advanced; and, on the 28th\r\nof June, Napoleon was at Wilna, where he foolishly remained seventeen\r\ndays--the greatest military blunder of his life. The Emperor Alexander\r\nhastened to Moscow, collected his armaments, and issued proclamations\r\nto his subjects, which excited them to the highest degree of\r\nenthusiasm to defend their altars and their firesides.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Smolensko.]\r\n\r\nBoth armies approached Smolensko about the 16th of July, and there was\r\nfought the first great battle of the campaign. The town was taken, and\r\nthe Russians retreated towards Moscow. But before this first conflict\r\nbegan, a considerable part of the army had perished from sickness and\r\nfatigue. At Borodino, another bloody battle was fought, in which more\r\nmen were killed and wounded than in any battle which history records.\r\nNapoleon, in this battle, did not exhibit his usual sagacity or\r\nenergy, being, perhaps, overwhelmed with anxiety and fatigue. His\r\ndispirited and broken army continued the march to Moscow, which was\r\nreached the 14th of September. The Sacred City of the Russians was\r\nabandoned by the army, and three hundred thousand of the inhabitants\r\ntook to flight. Napoleon had scarcely entered the deserted capital,\r\nand taken quarters in the ancient palace of the czars, before the city\r\nwas discovered to be on fire in several places; and even the Kremlin\r\nitself was soon enveloped in flames. Who could have believed that the\r\nRussians would have burnt their capital? Such an event surely never\r\nentered into a Frenchman\'s head. The consternation and horrors of that\r\nawful conflagration can never be described, or even conceived. Pillage\r\nand murder could scarcely add to the universal wretchedness.\r\nExecration, indignation, and vengeance filled the breasts of both the\r\nconquerors and the conquered. But who were the conquerors? Alas! those\r\nonly, who witnessed the complicated miseries and awful destruction of\r\nthe retreating army, have answered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retreat of the French.]\r\n\r\nThe retreat was the saddest tragedy ever acted by man, but rendered\r\ninevitable after the burning of Moscow, for Napoleon could not have\r\nadvanced to St. Petersburg. For some time, he lingered in the vicinity\r\nof Moscow, hoping for the submission of Russia. Alexander was too wise\r\nto treat for peace, and Napoleon and his diminished army, loaded,\r\nhowever, with the spoil of Moscow, commenced his retreat, in a hostile\r\nand desolate country, harassed by the increasing troops of the enemy.\r\nSoon, however, heavy frosts commenced, unusual even in Russia, and the\r\nroads were strewed by thousands who perished from fatigue and cold.\r\nThe retreat became a rout; for order, amid general destruction and\r\ndespair, could no longer be preserved. The Cossacks, too, hung upon\r\nthe rear of the retreating army, and cut off thousands whom the\r\nelements had spared. In less than a week, thirty thousand horses died,\r\nand the famished troops preyed upon their remains. The efforts of\r\nNapoleon proved in vain to procure provisions for the men, or forage\r\nfor the horses. Disasters thickened, and all abandoned themselves to\r\ndespair. Of all the awful scenes which appalled the heart, the passage\r\nof the Beresina was the most dreadful. When the ice was dissolved in\r\nthe following spring, twelve thousand dead bodies were found upon the\r\nshore. The shattered remnants of the Grand Army, after unparalleled\r\nsuffering, at length reached the bank of the Niemen. Not more than\r\ntwenty thousand of the vast host with which Napoleon passed Smolensko\r\nleft the Russian territory. Their course might be traced by the bones\r\nwhich afterwards whitened the soil. But before the Polish territories\r\nwere reached, Napoleon had deserted his army, and bore to Paris\r\nhimself the first intelligence of his great disaster. One hundred and\r\ntwenty-five thousand of his troops had died in battle, one hundred and\r\nninety thousand had been taken prisoners, and one hundred and\r\nthirty-two thousand had died of cold, fatigue and famine. Only eighty\r\nthousand had escaped, of whom twenty-five thousand were Austrians and\r\neighteen thousand were Prussians. The annals of the world furnish no\r\nexample of so complete an overthrow of so vast an armament, or so\r\nterrible a retribution to a vain-glorious nation.\r\n\r\nThis calamity proved the chief cause of Napoleon\'s overthrow. Had he\r\nretained his forces to fight on the defensive, he would have been too\r\nstrong for his enemies; but, by his Russian campaign, he lost a great\r\npart of his veteran troops, and the veneration of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nHis failure was immediately followed by the resurrection of Germany.\r\nBoth Austria and Prussia threw off the ignominious yoke he had\r\nimposed, and united with Russia to secure their ancient liberties. The\r\nenthusiasm of the Prussians was unbounded, and immense preparations\r\nwere made by all the allied powers for a new campaign. Napoleon\r\nexerted all the energies, which had ever distinguished him, to rally\r\nhis exhausted countrymen, and a large numerical force was again\r\nraised. But the troops were chiefly conscripts, young men, unable to\r\nendure the fatigue which his former soldiers sustained, and no longer\r\ninspired with their sentiments and ideas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battles of Lutzen and Bautzen.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1813 was opened in Germany, signalized by the battles\r\nof Lutzen and Bautzen, in which the French had the advantage. Saxony\r\nstill remained true to Napoleon, and he established his head-quarters\r\nin Dresden. The allies retreated, but only to prepare for more\r\nvigorous operations. England nobly assisted, and immense supplies were\r\nsent to the mouth of the Elbe, and distributed immediately through\r\nGermany. While these preparations were going on, the battle of\r\nVittoria, in Spain, was fought, which gave a death blow to French\r\npower in the Peninsula, and placed Wellington in the front rank of\r\ngenerals. Napoleon was now more than ever compelled to act on the\r\ndefensive, which does not suit the genius of the French character, and\r\nhe resolved to make the Elbe the base of his defensive operations. His\r\narmies, along this line, amounted to the prodigious number of four\r\nhundred thousand men; and Dresden, the head-quarters of Napoleon,\r\npresented a scene of unparalleled gayety and splendor, of\r\nlicentiousness, extravagance, and folly. But Napoleon was opposed by\r\nequally powerful forces, under Marshal Blucher, the Prussian general,\r\na veteran seventy years of age, and Prince Schwartzenberg, who\r\ncommanded the Austrians. But these immense armies composed not one\r\nhalf of the forces arrayed in desperate antagonism. Nine hundred\r\nthousand men in arms encircled the French empire, which was defended\r\nby seven hundred thousand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Leipsic.]\r\n\r\nThe allied forces marched upon Dresden, and a dreadful battle was\r\nfought, on the 27th of August, beneath its walls, which resulted in\r\nthe retreat of the allies, and in the death of General Moreau, who\r\nfought against his old commander. But Napoleon was unable to remain\r\nlong in that elegant capital, having exhausted his provisions and\r\nforage, and was obliged to retreat. On the 15th of October was fought\r\nthe celebrated battle of Leipsic, in which a greater number of men\r\nwere engaged than in any previous battle during the war, or probably\r\nin the history of Europe--two hundred and thirty thousand against one\r\nhundred and sixty thousand. The triumph of the allies was complete.\r\nNapoleon was overpowered by the overwhelming coalition of his enemies.\r\nHe had nothing to do, after his great discomfiture, but to retreat to\r\nFrance, and place the kingdom in the best defence in his power.\r\nMisfortunes thickened in every quarter; and, at the close of the\r\ncampaign, France retained but a few fortresses beyond the Rhine. The\r\ncontest in Germany was over, and French domination in that country was\r\nat an end. Out of four hundred thousand men, only eighty thousand\r\nrecrossed the Rhine. So great were the consequences of the battle of\r\nLeipsic, in which the genius of Napoleon was exhibited as in former\r\ntimes, but which availed nothing against vastly superior forces. A\r\ngrand alliance of all the powers of Europe was now arrayed against\r\nNapoleon--from the rock of Gibraltar to the shores of Archangel; from\r\nthe banks of the Scheldt to the margin of the Bosphorus; the mightiest\r\nconfederation ever known, but indispensably necessary. The greatness\r\nof Napoleon is seen in his indomitable will in resisting this\r\nconfederation, when his allies had deserted him, and when his own\r\nsubjects were no longer inclined to rally around his standard. He\r\nstill held out, even when over a million of men, from the different\r\nstates that he had humbled, were rapidly hemming him round and\r\nadvancing to his capital. Only three hundred and fifty thousand men\r\nnominally remained to defend his frontiers, while his real effective\r\narmy amounted to little over one hundred thousand men. A million of\r\nhis soldiers in eighteen months had perished, and where was he to look\r\nfor recruits?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Allied Powers Invade France.]\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of December, 1814, fourteen hundred and seven years after\r\nthe Suevi, Vandals, and Burgundians crossed the Rhine and entered\r\nwithout opposition the defenceless provinces of Gaul, the united\r\nPrussians, Austrians, and Russians crossed the same river, and invaded\r\nthe territories of the modern C\xc3\xa6sar. They rapidly advanced towards\r\nParis, and Napoleon went forth from his capital to meet them. His\r\ncause, however, was now desperate: but he made great exertions, and\r\ndisplayed consummate abilities, so that the forces of his enemies were\r\nfor a time kept at bay. Battles were fought and won by both sides,\r\nwithout decisive results. Slowly, but surely, the allied armies\r\nadvanced, and gradually surrounded him. By the 30th of March, they\r\nwere encamped on the heights of Montmartre; and Paris, defenceless and\r\nmiserable, surrendered to the conquerors. They now refused to treat\r\nwith Napoleon, who, a month before, at the conference of Chatillon,\r\nmight have retained his throne, if he had consented to reign over the\r\nterritories of France as they were before the Revolution. Napoleon\r\nretired to Fontainebleau; and, on the 4th of April, he consented to\r\nabdicate the throne he no longer could defend. His wife returned to\r\nher father\'s protection, and nearly every person of note or\r\nconsideration abandoned him. On the 11th, he formally abdicated, and\r\nthe house of Bourbon was restored. He himself retired to the Island of\r\nElba, but was allowed two million five hundred thousand francs a year,\r\nthe title of emperor, and four hundred soldiers as his body guard. His\r\nfarewell address to the soldiers of his old guard, at Fontainebleau,\r\nwas pathetic and eloquent. They retained their attachment amid general\r\ndesertion and baseness.\r\n\r\nJosephine did not long survive the fall of the hero she had loved, and\r\nwith whose fortunes her own were mysteriously united. She died on the\r\n28th, and her last hours were soothed by the presence of the Emperor\r\nAlexander, who promised to take her children under his protection. Of\r\nall the great monarchs of his age, he was the most extensively beloved\r\nand the most profoundly respected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peace of Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe allies showed great magnanimity and moderation after their\r\nvictory. The monarchy of France was established nearly as it was\r\nbefore the Revolution, and the capital was not rifled of any of its\r\nmonuments, curiosities, or treasures--not even of those which Napoleon\r\nhad brought from Italy. Nor was there a military contribution imposed\r\nupon the people. The allies did not make war to destroy the kingdom\r\nof France, but to dethrone a monarch who had proved himself to be\r\nthe enemy of mankind. The peace of Paris was signed by the\r\nplenipotentiaries of France, Great Britain, Russia, Prussia, and\r\nAustria, on the 30th of April; and Christendom, at last, indulged the\r\nhope that the awful conflict had ended. The Revolution and its\r\noffspring Napoleon were apparently suppressed, after more than three\r\nmillions of men had perished in the struggle on the part of France and\r\nof her allies alone.\r\n\r\nGreat changes had taken place in the sentiments of all classes, since\r\nthe commencement of the contest, twenty years before, and its close\r\nexcited universal joy. In England, the enthusiasm was unparalleled,\r\nand not easy to be conceived. The nation, in its gratitude to\r\nWellington, voted him four hundred thousand pounds, and the highest\r\nmilitary triumphs. It also conferred rewards and honors on his\r\nprincipal generals; for his successful operations in Spain were no\r\nslight cause of the overthrow of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely were these rejoicings terminated, before Napoleon escaped\r\nfrom Elba, and again overturned the throne of the Bourbons. The\r\nimpolitic generosity and almost inconceivable rashness of the allies\r\nhad enabled Napoleon to carry on extensive intrigues in Paris, and to\r\ncollect a respectable force on the island of which he was constituted\r\nthe sovereign; while the unpopularity and impolitic measures of the\r\nrestored dynasty singularly favored any scheme which Napoleon might\r\nhave formed. The disbanding of an immense military force, the\r\nhumiliation of those veterans who still associated with the eagles of\r\nNapoleon the glory of France, the derangement of the finances, and the\r\ndiscontents of so many people thrown out of employment, naturally\r\nprepared the way for the return of the hero of Marengo and Austerlitz.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon\'s Return to France.]\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of February, he gave a brilliant ball to the principal\r\npeople of the island, and embarked the same evening, with eleven\r\nhundred troops, to regain the sceptre which had been wrested from him\r\nonly by the united powers of Europe. On the 1st of March, his vessels\r\ncast anchor in the Gulf of St. Juan, on the coast of Provence; and\r\nNapoleon immediately commenced his march, having unfurled the\r\ntricolored flag. As he anticipated he was welcomed by the people, and\r\nthe old cry of "_Vive l\'Empereur_" saluted his ears.\r\n\r\nThe court of the Bourbons made vigorous preparations of resistance,\r\nand the armies of France were intrusted to those marshals who owed\r\ntheir elevation to Napoleon. Soult, Ney, Augereau, Massena, Oudinot,\r\nall protested devotion to Louis\xc2\xa0XVIII.; and Ney promised the king\r\nspeedily to return to Paris with Napoleon in an iron cage. But Ney was\r\namong the first to desert the cause of law and legitimacy, and threw\r\nhimself into the arms of the emperor. He could not withstand the arts\r\nand the eloquence of that great hero for whose cause he had so long\r\nfought. The defection of the whole army rapidly followed. The king was\r\nobliged to fly, and Napoleon took possession of his throne, amid the\r\nuniversal transports of the imperial party in France.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence of his restoration filled Europe with consternation,\r\nrage, and disappointment, and greater preparations were made than ever\r\nto subdue a man who respected neither treaties nor the interests of\r\nhis country. The unparalleled sum of one hundred and ten millions of\r\npounds sterling was decreed by the British senate for various\r\npurposes, and all the continental powers made proportionate exertions.\r\nThe genius of Napoleon never blazed so brightly as in preparing for\r\nhis last desperate conflict with united Christendom; and, considering\r\nthe exhaustion of his country, the forces which he collected were\r\nastonishing. Before the beginning of June, two hundred and twenty\r\nthousand veteran soldiers were completely armed and equipped; a great\r\nproof of the enthusiastic ardor which the people felt for Napoleon to\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington had eighty thousand effective men under his\r\ncommand, and Marshal Blucher one hundred and ten thousand. These\r\nforces were to unite, and march to Paris through Flanders. It was\r\narranged that the Austrians and Russians should invade France first,\r\nby Befort and Huningen, in order to attract the enemy\'s principal\r\nforces to that quarter.\r\n\r\nNapoleon\'s plan was to collect all his forces into one mass, and\r\nboldly to place them between the English and Prussians, and attack\r\nthem separately. He had under his command one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand veteran troops, and therefore, not unreasonably, expected to\r\ncombat successfully the one hundred and ninety thousand of the enemy.\r\nHe forgot, however, that he had to oppose Wellington and Blucher.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Waterloo.]\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of June was performed the last sad act of the great\r\ntragedy which had for twenty years convulsed Europe with blood and\r\ntears. All the combatants on that eventful day understood the nature\r\nof the contest, and the importance of the battle. At Waterloo,\r\nNapoleon staked his last throw in the desperate game he had hazarded,\r\nand lost it; and was ruined, irrevocably and forever.\r\n\r\nLittle signified his rapid flight, his attempt to defend Paris, or his\r\nreadiness to abdicate in favor of his son. The allied powers again, on\r\nthe 7th of July, entered Paris, and the Bourbon dynasty was restored.\r\n\r\nNapoleon retired to Rochefort, hoping to escape his enemies and reach\r\nAmerica. It was impossible. He then resolved to throw himself upon the\r\ngenerosity of the English. He was removed to St. Helena, where he no\r\nlonger stood a chance to become the scourge of the nations. And there,\r\non that lonely island, in the middle of the ocean, guarded most\r\neffectually by his enemies, his schemes of conquest ended. He\r\nsupported his hopeless captivity with tolerable equanimity, showing no\r\nsigns of remorse for the injuries he had inflicted, but meditating\r\nprofoundly on the mistakes he had committed, and conjecturing vainly\r\non the course he might have adopted for the preservation of his power.\r\n\r\nHow idle were all his conjectures and meditations! His fall was\r\ndecreed in the councils of Heaven, and no mortal strength could have\r\nprevented his overthrow. His mission of blood was ended; and his\r\nnation, after its bitter humiliation, was again to enjoy repose. But\r\nhe did not live in vain. He lived as a messenger of divine vengeance\r\nto chastise the objects of divine indignation. He lived to show to the\r\nworld what a splendid prize human energy could win; and yet to show\r\nhow vain, after all, was military glory, and how worthless is the\r\nenjoyment of any victory purchased by the sufferings of mankind. He\r\nlived to point the melancholy moral, that war, for its own sake, is a\r\ndelusion, a mockery, and a snare, and that the greater the elevation\r\nto which unlawful ambition can raise a man, the greater will be his\r\nsubsequent humiliation; that "pride goeth before destruction, and a\r\nhaughty spirit before a fall."\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reflections on Napoleon\'s Fall.]\r\n\r\nThe allied sovereigns of Europe insisted on the restoration of the\r\nworks of art which Napoleon had pillaged. "The bronzed horses, brought\r\nfrom Corinth to Rome, again resumed their old station in the front of\r\nthe Church of St. Mark; the Transfiguration was restored to the\r\nVatican; the Apollo and the Laocoon again adorned St. Peter\'s; the\r\nVenus was enshrined with new beauty at Florence; and the Descent from\r\nthe Cross was replaced in the Cathedral of Antwerp." By the treaty\r\nwhich restored peace to Europe for a generation, the old dominions of\r\nAustria, Prussia, Russia, Spain, Holland, and Italy were restored, and\r\nthe Bourbons again reigned over the ancient provinces of France.\r\nPopular liberty on the continent of Europe was entombed, and the\r\ndreams of revolutionists were unrealized; but suffering proved a\r\nbeneficial ordeal, and prepared the nations of Europe to appreciate,\r\nmore than ever, the benefits and blessings of peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     REFERENCES.--The most complete work, on the whole, though\r\n     full of faults, and very heavy and prosaic, is Alison\'s\r\n     History of the French Revolution.

And even a notice\r\nas extended as that which has been presented of the events of three\r\nhundred years would be unsatisfactory to all minds. The common reader\r\nis familiar with the transactions of the present generation, and\r\nreflections on them would be sure to excite the prejudices of various\r\nparties and sects. A chronological table of the events which have\r\ntranspired since the downfall of Napoleon is all that can be\r\nattempted. The author contemplates a continuation of this History,\r\nwhich will present more details, collected from original authorities.\r\nThe history of the different American States, since the Revolution;\r\nthe administration of the various presidents; the late war with Great\r\nBritain; the Seminole and Mexican wars; the important questions\r\ndiscussed by Congress; the contemporary history of Great Britain under\r\nGeorge\xc2\xa0IV., William\xc2\xa0IV., and Victoria; the conquests in India and\r\nChina; the agitations of Ireland; the great questions of Reform,\r\nCatholic Emancipation, Education, and Free Trade; the French wars in\r\nAfrica; the Turkish war; the independence of the Viceroy of Egypt; the\r\nprogress of Russian territorial aggrandizement; the fall of Poland;\r\nthe Spanish rebellion; the independence of the South American states;\r\nthe Dutch and Belgic war; the two last French revolutions; the great\r\nprogress made in arts and sciences, and the various attempts in\r\ndifferent nations to secure liberty;--these, and other great subjects,\r\ncan only be properly discussed in a separate work, and even then\r\ncannot be handled by any one, however extraordinary his talents or\r\nattainments, without incurring the imputation of great audacity, which\r\nonly the wants of the public can excuse.\r\n\r\nIn concluding the present History, a very brief notice of the state of\r\nthe civilized world at the fall of Napoleon may be, perhaps, required.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remarkable Men of Genius.]\r\n\r\nEngland suffered less than any other of the great powers from the\r\nFrench Revolution. A great burden was, indeed, entailed on future\r\ngenerations; but the increase of the national debt was not felt so\r\nlong as English manufactures were purchased, to a great extent, by the\r\nContinental States. Six hundred million pounds were added to the\r\nnational debt; but England, internally, was never more flourishing\r\nthan during this long war of a quarter of a century. And not only was\r\nglory shed around the British throne by the victories of Nelson and\r\nWellington, and the effectual assistance which England rendered to the\r\ncontinental powers, and without which the liberties of Europe would\r\nhave been subverted, but, during the reign of George\xc2\xa0III., a splendid\r\nconstellation of men of genius, in literature and science, illuminated\r\nthe world. Dr. Johnson made moral reflections on human life which will\r\never instruct mankind; Burke uttered prophetic oracles which even his\r\nage was not prepared to appreciate; and his rivals thundered in the\r\nsenate with an eloquence and power not surpassed by the orators of\r\nantiquity; Gibbon wrote a history which such men as Guizot and Milman\r\npronounced wonderful both for art and learning; Hume, Reid, and\r\nStewart, carried metaphysical inquiry to its utmost depth; Gray,\r\nBurns, Goldsmith, Coleridge, Southey, and Wordsworth, were not\r\nunworthy successors of Dryden and Pope; Adam Smith called into\r\nexistence the science of political economy, and nearly brought it to\r\nperfection in a single lifetime; Reynolds and West adorned the\r\ngalleries with pictures which would not have disgraced the land of\r\nartists; while scholars, too numerous to mention, astonished the world\r\nby the extent of their erudition; and divines, in language which\r\nrivalled the eloquence of Chrysostom or Bossuet, declared to an\r\nawakened generation the duties and destinies of man.\r\n\r\nFrance, the rival of England, was not probably permanently injured by\r\nthe Revolution; for, if millions of lives were sacrificed, and\r\nmillions of property were swept away, still important civil and social\r\nprivileges were given to the great mass of the people, and odious\r\nfeudal laws and customs were broken forever. All the glory which war\r\ncan give, was obtained; and France, for twenty years, was feared and\r\nrespected. Popular liberty was not secured; but advances were made\r\ntowards it, and great moral truths were impressed upon the nation,--to\r\nbe again disregarded, but not to be forgotten. The territorial limits\r\nof France were not permanently enlarged, and the conquests of Napoleon\r\nwere restored to the original rulers. The restoration of the former\r\npolitical system was insisted upon by the Holy Alliance, and the\r\nBourbon kings, in regaining their throne, again possessed all that\r\ntheir ancestors had enjoyed but the possession of the hearts of the\r\npeople. The allied powers may have restored despotism and legitimacy\r\nfor a while; they could not eradicate the great ideas of the\r\nRevolution, and these were destined once more to overturn their\r\nthrones. The reigns of Louis\xc2\xa0XVIII., Charles\xc2\xa0X., and Louis Philippe\r\nwere but different acts of the long tragedy which was opened by the\r\nconvocation of the States General, and which is not probably closed by\r\nthe election of Prince Louis Napoleon to the presidency of the French\r\nrepublic. The _ideas_ which animated La Fayette and Moreau, and which\r\nRobespierre and Napoleon at one time professed, still live, in spite\r\nof all the horrors of the Reign of Terror, and all the streams of\r\nblood which flowed at Leipsic and Waterloo. Notwithstanding the\r\nsuicidal doctrines of Socialists and of the various schools of infidel\r\nphilosophers, and in view of all the evils which papal despotism, and\r\ndemocratic license, and military passions have inflicted, and will\r\ncontinue to inflict, still the immortal principles of liberty are safe\r\nunder the protection of that Providence which has hitherto advanced\r\nthe nations of Europe from the barbarism and paganism of ancient\r\nTeutonic tribes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condition of Germany.]\r\n\r\nGermany suffered the most, and apparently reaped the least, from the\r\nstorms which revolutionary discussion had raised. Austria and Prussia\r\nwere invaded, pillaged, and humiliated. Their cities were sacked,\r\ntheir fields were devastated, and the blood of their sons was poured\r\nout like water. But sacrifice and suffering developed extraordinary\r\nvirtues and energies, united the various states, and gave nationality\r\nto a great confederation. The struggles of the Germans were honorable\r\nand gigantic, and proved to the world the impossibility of the\r\nconquest of states, however afflicted, when they are resolved to\r\ndefend their rights. The career of Napoleon demonstrated the\r\nimpossibility of a universal empire in Europe, and least of all, an\r\nempire erected over the prostrated thrones and discomfited armies of\r\nGermany. The Germans learned the necessity and the duty of union, and\r\nproved the strength of their sincere love for their native soil and\r\ntheir venerable institutions. The Germans, though poor in gold and\r\nsilver, showed that they were rich in patriotic ardor, and in all\r\nthose glorious sentiments which ennoble a great and progressive\r\nnation. After twenty years\' contention, and infinite sacrifices and\r\nhumiliations, the different princes of Germany recovered their ancient\r\nterritorial possessions, and were seated, more firmly than before on\r\nthe thrones which legitimacy had consecrated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condition of Other Powers.]\r\n\r\nAbsolute monarchy was restored also to Spain; but the imbecile\r\nBourbons, the tools of priests and courtiers, revived the ancient\r\nprinciples of absolutism and bigotry, without any of those virtues\r\nwhich make absolutism respectable or bigotry endurable. But in the\r\nbreasts of Spanish peasants the fires of liberty burned, which all the\r\nterrors of priestly rule, and all the evils of priestly corruption,\r\ncould not quench. They, thus far, have been unfortunate, but no person\r\nwho has studied the elements of the Spanish character, or has faith in\r\nthe providence of God, can doubt that the day of deliverance will,\r\nsooner or later, come, unless he has the misfortune to despair of any\r\npermanent triumph of liberty in our degenerate world.\r\n\r\nIn the northern kingdoms of Europe, no radical change took place; and\r\nItaly, the land of artists, so rich in splendid recollections, so poor\r\nin all those blessings which we are taught to value, returned to the\r\ndominion of Austria, and to the rule of despotic priests. Italy,\r\ndisunited, abandoned, and enslaved, has made generous efforts to\r\nsecure what is enjoyed in more favored nations, but hitherto in vain.\r\nSo slow is the progress of society! so hard are the struggles to which\r\nman is doomed! so long continued are the efforts of any people to\r\nsecure important privileges!\r\n\r\nGreece made, however, a more successful effort, and the fetters of the\r\nTurkish sultan were shaken off. The Ottoman Porte looked, with its\r\naccustomed indifference, on the struggles of the Christians, and took\r\nno active part in the war until absolutely forced. But it looked with\r\nthe indifference of decrepit age, rather than with the philosophical\r\ncalmness of mature strength, and exerted all the remaining energies it\r\npossessed to prevent the absorption of the state in the vast and\r\nincreasing empire of the czars. Russia, of all the great powers which\r\nembarked in the contest to which we have alluded, arose the strongest\r\nfrom defeat and disaster. The rapid aggrandizement of Russia\r\nimmediately succeeded the fall of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual empire of the Popes was again restored, and the Jesuits,\r\nwith new powers and privileges, were sent into all the nations of the\r\nearth to uphold the absolutism of their great head. Again they have\r\ntriumphed when their cause seemed hopeless; nor is it easy to predict\r\nthe fall of their empire. So long as the principle of Evil shall\r\ncontend with the principle of Good, the popes will probably rejoice\r\nand weep at alternate victories and defeats.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The United States of America.]\r\n\r\nThe United States of America were too far removed from the scene of\r\nconflict to be much affected by the fall of thrones. Moreover, it was\r\nagainst the wise policy of the government to interfere with foreign\r\nquarrels. But the American nation beheld the conflict with any\r\nfeelings but those of indifference, and, while its enlightened people\r\nspeculated on the chances of war, they still devoted themselves with\r\nardor to the improvement of their institutions, to agriculture, and\r\nmanufacturing interests. Merchants, for a while, made their fortunes\r\nby being the masters of the carrying trade of the world, and the\r\nnation was quietly enriched. The wise administrations of Washington,\r\nAdams, Jefferson, and Madison, much as they conflicted, in some\r\nrespects, with each other, resulted in the growth of commerce,\r\nmanufactures, agriculture, and the arts; while institutions of\r\nliterature and religion took a deep hold of the affections of the\r\npeople. The country increased and spread with unparalleled rapidity on\r\nall sides, and the prosperity of America was the envy and the\r\nadmiration of the European world. The encroachments of Great Britain,\r\nand difficulties which had never been settled, led to a war between\r\nthe two countries, which, though lamented at the time, is now viewed,\r\nby all parties, as resulting in the ultimate advancement of the United\r\nStates in power and wealth, as well as in the respect of foreign\r\nnations. Great questions connected with the rapid growth of the\r\ncountry, unfortunately at different times, have produced acrimonious\r\nfeelings between different partisans; but the agitation of these has\r\nnot checked the growth of American institutions, or weakened those\r\nsentiments of patriotism and mutual love, which, in all countries and\r\nages, have constituted the glory and defence of nations. The greatness\r\nof American destinies is now a favorite theme with popular orators.\r\nNor is it a vain subject of speculation. Our banner of Liberty will\r\ndoubtless, at no distant day, wave over all the fortresses which may\r\nbe erected on the central mountains of North America, or on the shores\r\nof its far distant oceans; but all national aggrandizement will be in\r\nvain without regard to those sacred principles of law, religion, and\r\nmorality, for which, in disaster and sorrow, both Puritan Settler and\r\nRevolutionary Hero contended. The believer in Progress, as affected by\r\ninfluences independent of man, as coming from the benevolent\r\nProvidence which thus far has shielded us, cannot otherwise than hope\r\nfor a still loftier national elevation than has been yet attained,\r\nwith all the aid of circumstances, and all the energies of heroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL TABLE\r\n\r\nFROM THE FALL OF NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\n\r\n     1815.--Battle of Waterloo, (June 18.)

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\r\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\r\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\ncollection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\r\n"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\r\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\r\nproperty infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\r\ncomputer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\r\nyour equipment.\r\n\r\n1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right\r\nof Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\r\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\r\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\r\nfees.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\r\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\r\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\r\nwith this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\r\npromotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\r\nharmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\r\nthat arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\r\nor cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nwork, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\r\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\'s web site and official\r\npage at http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
