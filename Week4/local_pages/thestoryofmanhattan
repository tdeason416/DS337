Empire Day is the festival\r\non which every British subject should reverently remember that the\r\nBritish Empire stands out before the whole world as the fearless\r\nchampion of freedom, fair play and equal rights; that its watchwords are\r\nresponsibility, duty, sympathy and self-sacrifice, and that a special\r\nresponsibility rests with you individually to be true to the traditions\r\nand to the mission of your race.\r\n\r\nI also want you to remember that one day Canada will become, if her\r\npeople are faithful to their high British traditions, the most powerful\r\nof all the self-governing nations, not excluding the people of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, which make up the British Empire, and that it rests with\r\neach one of you individually to do your utmost by your own conduct and\r\nexample to make Canada not only the most powerful, but the noblest of\r\nall the self-governing nations that are proud to owe allegiance to the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\nEarl Grey.\r\nGovernor-General of Canada\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD READER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO-DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n    So here hath been dawning\r\n      Another blue day;\r\n    Think, wilt thou let it\r\n      Slip useless away?\r\n\r\n    Out of Eternity\r\n      This new day is born;\r\n    Into Eternity\r\n      At night will return.\r\n\r\n    Behold it aforetime\r\n      No eye ever did;\r\n    So soon it forever\r\n      From all eyes is hid.\r\n\r\n    Here hath been dawning\r\n      Another blue day;\r\n    Think, wilt thou let it\r\n      Slip useless away?\r\n\r\nCARLYLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTUNE AND THE BEGGAR\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day a ragged beggar was creeping along from house to house. He\r\ncarried an old wallet in his hand, and was asking at every door for a\r\nfew cents to buy something to eat. As he was grumbling at his lot, he\r\nkept wondering why it was that folks who had so much money were never\r\nsatisfied but were always wanting more.\r\n\r\n"Here," said he, "is the master of this house--I know him well. He was\r\nalways a good business man, and he made himself wondrously rich a long\r\ntime ago. Had he been wise he would have stopped then. He would have\r\nturned over his business to some one else, and then he could have spent\r\nthe rest of his life in ease. But what did he do instead? He built ships\r\nand sent them to sea to trade with foreign lands. He thought he would\r\nget mountains of gold.\r\n\r\n"But there were great storms on the water; his ships were wrecked, and\r\nhis riches were swallowed up by the waves. Now all his hopes lie at the\r\nbottom of the sea, and his great wealth has vanished.\r\n\r\n"There are many such cases. Men seem to be never satisfied unless they\r\ngain the whole world.\r\n\r\n"As for me, if I had only enough to eat and to wear, I would not want\r\nanything more."\r\n\r\nJust at that moment Fortune came down the street. She saw the beggar and\r\nstopped. She said to him:\r\n\r\n"Listen! I have long wished to help you. Hold your wallet and I will\r\npour this gold into it, but only on this condition: all that falls into\r\nthe wallet shall be pure gold; but every piece that falls upon the\r\nground shall become dust. Do you understand?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I understand," said the beggar.\r\n\r\n"Then have a care," said Fortune. "Your wallet is old, so do not load it\r\ntoo heavily."\r\n\r\nThe beggar was so glad that he could hardly wait. He quickly opened his\r\nwallet, and a stream of yellow dollars poured into it. The wallet grew\r\nheavy.\r\n\r\n"Is that enough?" asked Fortune.\r\n\r\n"Not yet."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it cracking?"\r\n\r\n"Never fear."\r\n\r\nThe beggar\'s hands began to tremble. Ah, if the golden stream would only\r\npour for ever!\r\n\r\n"You are the richest man in the world now!"\r\n\r\n"Just a little more, add just a handful or two."\r\n\r\n"There, it\'s full. The wallet will burst."\r\n\r\n"But it will hold a little, just a little more!"\r\n\r\nAnother piece was added, and the wallet split. The treasure fell upon\r\nthe ground and was turned to dust. Fortune had vanished. The beggar had\r\nnow nothing but his empty wallet, and it was torn from top to bottom. He\r\nwas as poor as before.\r\n\r\nIVAN KIRLOFF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LARK AND THE ROOK\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Good-night, Sir Rook!" said a little lark,\r\n    "The daylight fades; it will soon be dark;\r\n    I\'ve bathed my wings in the sun\'s last ray;\r\n    I\'ve sung my hymn to the parting day;\r\n    So now I haste to my quiet nook\r\n    In yon dewy meadow--good-night, Sir Rook!"\r\n\r\n    "Good-night, poor Lark," said his titled friend\r\n    With a haughty toss and a distant bend;\r\n    "I also go to my rest profound,\r\n    But not to sleep on the cold, damp ground.\r\n    The fittest place for a bird like me\r\n    Is the topmost bough of yon tall pine tree.\r\n\r\n    "I opened my eyes at peep of day\r\n    And saw you taking your upward way,\r\n    Dreaming your fond romantic dreams,\r\n    An ugly speck in the sun\'s bright beams,\r\n    Soaring too high to be seen or heard;\r\n    And I said to myself: \'What a foolish bird!\'\r\n\r\n    "I trod the park with a princely air;\r\n    I filled my crop with the richest fare;\r\n    I cawed all day \'mid a lordly crew,\r\n    And I made more noise in the world than you!\r\n    The sun shone forth on my ebon wing;\r\n    I looked and wondered--good-night, poor thing!"\r\n\r\n    "Good-night, once more," said the lark\'s sweet voice,\r\n    "I see no cause to repent my choice;\r\n    You build your nest in the lofty pine,\r\n    But is your slumber more sweet than mine?\r\n    You make more noise in the world than I,\r\n    But whose is the sweeter minstrelsy?"\r\n\r\nUNKNOWN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    What stronger breast-plate than a heart untainted?\r\n    Thrice is he armed, that hath his quarrel just;\r\n    And he but naked, though locked up in steel,\r\n    Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PICKWICK CLUB ON THE ICE\r\n\r\n\r\n"You skate, of course, Winkle?" said Wardle.\r\n\r\n"Ye-yes; oh, yes," replied Mr. Winkle. "I--I--am _rather_ out of\r\npractice."\r\n\r\n"Oh, _do_ skate, Mr. Winkle," said Arabella. "I like to see it so much."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is _so_ graceful," said another young lady. A third young lady\r\nsaid it was elegant, and a fourth expressed her opinion that it was\r\n"swan-like."\r\n\r\n"I should be very happy, I\'m sure," said Mr. Winkle, reddening; "but I\r\nhave no skates."\r\n\r\nThis objection was at once overruled. Trundle had got a couple of pair,\r\nand the fat boy announced that there were half a dozen more downstairs,\r\nwhereat Mr. Winkle expressed exquisite delight, and looked exquisitely\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\nOld Wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice; and the fat boy\r\nand Mr. Weller, having shovelled and swept away the snow which had\r\nfallen on it during the night, Mr. Bob Sawyer adjusted his skates with a\r\ndexterity which to Mr. Winkle seemed perfectly marvellous, and described\r\ncircles with his left leg, and cut figures of eight, and inscribed upon\r\nthe ice, without once stopping for breath, a great many other pleasant\r\nand astonishing devices, to the excessive satisfaction of Mr. Pickwick,\r\nMr. Tupman, and the ladies; which reached a pitch of positive\r\nenthusiasm, when old Wardle and Benjamin Allen, assisted by the\r\naforesaid Bob Sawyer, performed some mystic evolutions, which they\r\ncalled a reel.\r\n\r\nAll this time, Mr. Winkle, with his face and hands blue with the cold,\r\nhad been forcing a gimlet into the soles of his feet, and putting his\r\nskates on with the points behind, and getting the straps into a very\r\ncomplicated and entangled state, with the assistance of Mr. Snodgrass,\r\nwho knew rather less about skates than a Hindoo. At length, however,\r\nwith the assistance of Mr. Weller, the unfortunate skates were firmly\r\nscrewed and buckled on, and Mr. Winkle was raised to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, sir," said Sam in an encouraging tone; "off vith you, and\r\nshow \'em how to do it."\r\n\r\n"Stop, Sam, stop," said Mr. Winkle, trembling violently, and clutching\r\nhold of Sam\'s arms with the grasp of a drowning man. "How slippery it\r\nis, Sam!"\r\n\r\n"Not an uncommon thing upon ice, sir," replied Mr. Weller. "Hold up,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\nThis last observation of Mr. Weller\'s bore reference to a demonstration\r\nMr. Winkle made at the instant, of a frantic desire to throw his feet\r\ninto the air and dash the back of his head on the ice.\r\n\r\n"These--these--are very awkward skates; ain\'t they, Sam?" inquired Mr.\r\nWinkle, staggering.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afeerd there\'s an orkard gen\'lm\'n in \'em, sir," replied Sam.\r\n\r\n"Now, Winkle," cried Mr. Pickwick, quite unconscious that there was\r\nanything the matter. "Come, the ladies are all anxiety."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," replied Mr. Winkle, with a ghastly smile. "I\'m coming."\r\n\r\n"Just a goin\' to begin," said Sam, endeavouring to disengage himself.\r\n"Now, sir, start off."\r\n\r\n"Stop an instant, Sam," gasped Mr. Winkle, clinging most affectionately\r\nto Mr. Weller. "I find I\'ve a couple of coats at home that I don\'t want,\r\nSam. You may have them, Sam."\r\n\r\n"Thank\'ee, sir," replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n"Never mind touching your hat, Sam," said Mr. Winkle, hastily. "You\r\nneedn\'t take your hand away to do that. I meant to have given you five\r\nshillings this morning for a Christmas-box, Sam. I\'ll give it to you\r\nthis afternoon, Sam."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wery good, sir," replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n"Just hold me at first, Sam; will you?" said Mr. Winkle. "There--that\'s\r\nright. I shall soon get into the way of it, Sam. Not too fast, Sam; not\r\ntoo fast."\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle, stooping forward with his body half doubled up, was being\r\nassisted over the ice by Mr. Weller, in a very singular and un-swan-like\r\nmanner, when Mr. Pickwick most innocently shouted from the opposite\r\nbank--\r\n\r\n"Sam!"\r\n\r\n"Sir?" said Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n"Here. I want you."\r\n\r\n"Let go, sir," said Sam. "Don\'t you hear the governor a-callin\'? Let go,\r\nsir!"\r\n\r\nWith a violent effort, Mr. Weller disengaged himself from the grasp of\r\nthe agonized Pickwickian; and, in so doing, administered a considerable\r\nimpetus to the unhappy Mr. Winkle. With an accuracy which no degree of\r\ndexterity or practice could have insured, that unfortunate gentleman\r\nbore swiftly down into the centre of the reel, at the very moment when\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer was performing a flourish of unparalleled beauty. Mr.\r\nWinkle struck wildly against him, and with a loud crash they both fell\r\nheavily down. Mr. Pickwick ran to the spot. Bob Sawyer had risen to his\r\nfeet, but Mr. Winkle was far too wise to do anything of the kind in\r\nskates. He was seated on the ice making spasmodic efforts to smile; but\r\nanguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance.\r\n\r\n"Are you hurt?" inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen, with great anxiety.\r\n\r\n"Not much," said Mr. Winkle, rubbing his back very hard.\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d let me bleed you," said Mr. Benjamin, with great\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," replied Mr. Winkle hurriedly.\r\n\r\n"I really think you had better," said Allen.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," replied Mr. Winkle "I\'d rather not."\r\n\r\n"What do _you_ think, Mr. Pickwick?" inquired Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was excited and indignant. He beckoned to Mr. Weller, and\r\nsaid in a stern voice:\r\n\r\n"Take his skates off."\r\n\r\nThe command was not to be resisted. Mr. Winkle allowed Sam to obey it in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"Lift him up," said Mr. Pickwick. Sam assisted him to rise.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick retired a few paces apart from the bystanders; and,\r\nbeckoning his friend to approach, fixed a searching look upon him, and\r\nuttered in a low but distinct and emphatic tone these remarkable words:\r\n\r\n"You\'re a humbug, sir."\r\n\r\n"A what?" said Mr. Winkle, starting.\r\n\r\n"A humbug, sir. I will speak plainer, if you wish it. An impostor, sir."\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Pickwick turned slowly on his heel and rejoined\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\nDICKENS: "The Pickwick Papers."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBAL CAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n    Old Tubal Cain was a man of might,\r\n      In the days when earth was young;\r\n    By the fierce red light of his furnace bright,\r\n      The strokes of his hammer rung:\r\n    And he lifted high his brawny hand\r\n      On the iron glowing clear,\r\n    Till the sparks rushed out in scarlet showers,\r\n      As he fashioned the sword and spear.\r\n    And he sang--"Hurrah for my handiwork!\r\n      Hurrah for the spear and sword!\r\n    Hurrah for the hand that shall wield them well,\r\n      For he shall be king and lord!"\r\n\r\n    To Tubal Cain came many a one,\r\n      As he wrought by his roaring fire;\r\n    And each one prayed for a strong steel blade,\r\n      As the crown of his desire;\r\n    And he made them weapons sharp and strong,\r\n      Till they shouted loud for glee;\r\n    And they gave him gifts of pearls and gold,\r\n      And spoils of the forest free.\r\n    And they sang--"Hurrah for Tubal Cain,\r\n      Who hath given us strength anew!\r\n    Hurrah for the smith, hurrah for the fire,\r\n      And hurrah for the metal true!"\r\n\r\n    But a sudden change came o\'er his heart,\r\n      Ere the setting of the sun;\r\n    And Tubal Cain was filled with pain\r\n      For the evil he had done:\r\n    He saw that men, with rage and hate,\r\n      Made war upon their kind,\r\n    That the land was red with the blood they shed,\r\n      In their lust for carnage blind.\r\n    And he said--"Alas! that I ever made,\r\n      Or that skill of mine should plan,\r\n    The spear and the sword for men whose joy\r\n      Is to slay their fellow-man!"\r\n\r\n    And for many a day old Tubal Cain\r\n      Sat brooding o\'er his woe;\r\n    And his hand forbore to smite the ore,\r\n      And his furnace smouldered low.\r\n    But he rose at last with a cheerful face,\r\n      And a bright courageous eye,\r\n    And bared his strong right arm for work,\r\n      While the quick flames mounted high.\r\n    And he sang--"Hurrah for my handiwork!"\r\n      And the red sparks lit the air;\r\n    "Not alone for the blade was the bright steel made,"\r\n      And he fashioned the first ploughshare.\r\n\r\n    And men, taught wisdom from the past,\r\n      In friendship joined their hands;\r\n    Hung the sword in the hall, the spear on the wall,\r\n      And ploughed the willing lands:\r\n    And sang--"Hurrah for Tubal Cain!\r\n      Our stanch good friend is he;\r\n    And for the ploughshare and the plough,\r\n      To him our praise shall be.\r\n    But while oppression lifts its head,\r\n      Or a tyrant would be lord;\r\n    Though we may thank him for the plough,\r\n      We\'ll not forget the sword!"\r\n\r\nCHARLES MACKAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR FROG\'S LECTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nBobby was not quite sure that he was awake, but when he opened his eyes\r\nthere was the blue sky, with the soft, white clouds drifting across it,\r\nthe big pine waving its spicy branches over his head, and beyond, the\r\nglint of sunshine on the waters of the pond. Presently Bobby heard\r\nvoices talking softly.\r\n\r\n"This is a good specimen," said one voice. "See how stout and strong he\r\nlooks!"\r\n\r\n"I wonder who that is, and what he has found," thought Bobby. "I wish it\r\nwasn\'t such hard work to keep my eyes open." He made a great effort,\r\nhowever, and raised his heavy lids. At first he could see nothing. Then\r\nhe caught a glimpse of a mossy log, with a row of frogs and toads\r\nsitting upon it. They were looking solemnly at him. Bobby felt a little\r\nuncomfortable under that steady gaze.\r\n\r\n"The toads are making their spring visit to the pond to lay their eggs,"\r\nthought the boy. "I forgot that they were due this week."\r\n\r\n"He must have done a good deal of mischief in his day," said an old\r\nbull-frog, gravely. A chill crept over Bobby. "In his day."--What did\r\nthat mean?\r\n\r\nA toad hopped out from the line and came so close to Bobby that he could\r\nhave touched her but for the strange spell which held him fast.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said she; "this is one of the species. We are very fortunate to\r\nhave caught him. Now we shall be ready to listen to Professor Rana\'s\r\nremarks."\r\n\r\nStill Bobby could not move. What were they going to do? In a moment\r\nthere was a rustling among the dry leaves and dozens of frogs and toads\r\nwere seen hurrying towards the pine tree. Among them was a ponderous\r\nfrog, carrying a roll of manuscript under his arm. He wore huge goggles,\r\nand looked so wise that Bobby did not dare to laugh.\r\n\r\n"I am very sleepy," murmured a portly toad near Bobby\'s left ear. "I\r\nlaid over eight thousand eggs last night, and I have a long journey\r\nbefore me. But I must stay to hear this. We may never have such a chance\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Ladies and gentlemen," began the professor, in a sonorous tone that was\r\neasily heard for several feet, "this is a specimen of the creature known\r\nto us as the human tadpole. You will kindly observe his long legs. They\r\nwere doubtless given to him for the purpose of protection. Being\r\npossessed of a most mischievous and reckless spirit, the species is\r\nalways getting into difficulties, and would probably become extinct if\r\nit had not the power to run away."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" said Bobby under his breath. There was a murmur of interest\r\nand curiosity among the crowd. Bobby felt his legs twitch nervously, but\r\nhis power over them was gone.\r\n\r\n"Otherwise," went on the lecturer, "he is not at all adapted to his\r\nsurroundings. Observe how carefully we are dressed. The frogs have the\r\ngreen and brown tints of their homes by the water-side. The toads look\r\nlike lumps of dirt, so that they may not be too readily snapped up by\r\nbirds of prey. But the Boy--to call him by his scientific name--has no\r\nsuch protection. Look at this red shirt and these white trousers, and\r\nthis hat as big as a trout pool! Could anything be more ridiculous? Even\r\na giraffe does not look so absurd as this."\r\n\r\nA red flush mounted to Bobby\'s freckled cheeks, but this time he did not\r\ntry to speak.\r\n\r\n"Now," said the professor, "as far as we have been able to learn, the\r\nhuman tadpole is absolutely useless. We are, therefore, doing no harm in\r\nexperimenting upon this specimen. There are plenty of them, and this one\r\nwill not be a serious loss."\r\n\r\n"Stop!" said Bobby, so unexpectedly that everybody jumped. "What are you\r\ngoing to do with me?"\r\n\r\n"You will be so kind as to lie still," said the professor severely. "At\r\npresent you are only a specimen."\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it. Bobby found it impossible to move hand or\r\nfoot. He could wriggle a little,--but that was all.\r\n\r\n"Not only is the Boy entirely useless," went on the professor, "but he\r\nis often what might be called a pest, even to his own kind. He is\r\nendured in the world for what he may become when he is full-grown, and\r\neven then he is sometimes disappointing. You are familiar with many of\r\nhis objectionable ways towards the animal world, but I am sure you would\r\nbe surprised if you knew what a care and trouble he frequently is to his\r\nown people. He can be trusted to do few kinds of work. It is difficult\r\nto keep him clean. He doesn\'t know how to get his own dinner. He has a\r\ngenius for making weaker things miserable. He likes fishing, and he\r\nlongs for a gun; he collects birds\' eggs; he puts butterflies on pins;\r\nhe teases his little sisters."\r\n\r\n"Why isn\'t the species exterminated?" asked another frog angrily.\r\n\r\nThen the toad near Bobby\'s ear spoke timidly: "I think you are a little\r\nunjust, Professor. I have known boys who were comparatively harmless."\r\n\r\n"It is true there may be a few, Mrs. Bufo," said the professor with\r\ngreat politeness, "but as a class they may be fairly set down as of very\r\ndoubtful value. Speak up, Tadpole, and say if I have made any false\r\nstatements so far."\r\n\r\nBobby fairly shouted in his eagerness to be heard.\r\n\r\n"We do work," he said. "We have to go to school every day."\r\n\r\n"What a help that must be to your parents and to the world at large!"\r\nsaid the frog with sarcasm. "I am surprised that we never see the\r\nresults of such hard labour. Do you know how useful even our smallest\r\ntadpoles are? Without them this pond would be no longer beautiful, but\r\nfoul and ill-smelling. As for what we do when we are grown up, modesty\r\nforbids me to praise the frogs, but you know what a toad is worth to\r\nmankind?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Bobby. "About two cents, I guess." Bobby didn\'t intend to be\r\nrude. He thought this a liberal valuation.\r\n\r\n"Twenty dollars a year, as estimated by the Department of Agriculture!"\r\ncried the frog triumphantly. "What do you think of that?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to know why," said Bobby, looking as if he thought\r\nProfessor Rana was making fun of him.\r\n\r\n"What are the greatest enemies of mankind?" asked the professor, peering\r\nover his goggles at poor Bobby.\r\n\r\n"Tigers," said Bobby, promptly; "or wolves."\r\n\r\n"Wrong," said the lecturer. "Insects. Insects destroy property on this\r\ncontinent to the amount of over four hundred million dollars annually.\r\nInsects destroy the crops upon which man depends for his food. Going to\r\nschool hasn\'t made you very wise, has it? Well, the toads are insect\r\ndestroyers. That\'s their business. If the State only knew enough to make\r\nuse of them, millions of dollars might be saved every year. Does it seem\r\nto you that the human animal is so clever as it might be, when it allows\r\nsuch numbers of toads to be destroyed?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a shame!" chimed in a voice from the front seats. "We keep out of\r\nthe way as much as we can; we eat every kind of troublesome worm and\r\ninsect,--the cutworm, canker-worm, tent caterpillar, army-worm,\r\nrose-beetle, and the common house-fly; we ask for no wages or food or\r\ncare,--and what do we get in return? Not even protection and common\r\nkindness. If we had places where we could live in safety, who could tell\r\nthe amount of good we might do? Yet I would not have this poor boy hurt\r\nif a word of mine could prevent it."\r\n\r\n"This is a scientific meeting," observed the professor; "and benevolent\r\nsentiments are quite out of place. We will now proceed to notice the\r\ndelicate nervous system of the creature. Stand closer, my friends, if\r\nyou please."\r\n\r\n"Nervous system, indeed!" said Bobby. "Boys don\'t have such silly things\r\nas nerves!"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Bobby felt a multitude of tiny pin pricks over the entire\r\nsurface of his body. The suffering was not intense, but the irritation\r\nmade him squirm and wince. He could not discover the cause of his\r\ndiscomfort, but at the professor\'s command it suddenly ceased.\r\n\r\n"That will do," said the frog. "Each hair on his head is also connected\r\nwith a nerve. Pull his hair, please!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t!" said Bobby. "That hurts!"\r\n\r\nNobody listened to him. It did hurt, more than you would think, for tiny\r\nhands were pulling each hair separately. When the ordeal was over,\r\nBobby heard a faint noise in the grass as if some very small creatures\r\nwere scurrying away, but he could see nothing. He was winking his eyes\r\ndesperately to keep from crying.\r\n\r\n"The assistants may go now," said the professor; and the sound of little\r\nfeet died away in the distance.\r\n\r\n"How interesting this is!" murmured a plain-looking toad who had been\r\nwatching the experiments attentively.\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s mean," protested poor Bobby, "to keep a fellow fastened up\r\nlike this, and then torment him."\r\n\r\n"Does it hurt as much as being skinned, or having your legs cut off?"\r\ndemanded the professor.\r\n\r\n"Or should you prefer to be stepped on, or burned up in a rubbish pile?"\r\nasked Mrs. Bufo.\r\n\r\n"How should you like to be stoned or kicked, for a change?" said another\r\ntoad sharply.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you would choose a fish-hook in the corner of your mouth?" said\r\na voice from the pond.\r\n\r\n"Or one run the entire length of your body?" came a murmur from the\r\nground under Bobby\'s head.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute," said the professor, more gently. "We will give you a\r\nchance to defend yourself. It is not customary to inquire into the moral\r\ncharacter of specimens, but we do not wish to be unjust. Perhaps you can\r\nexplain why you made a bonfire the very week after the toads came out of\r\ntheir winter-quarters. Dozens of lives were destroyed before that fire\r\nwas put out."\r\n\r\n"I forgot about the toads," began Bobby.\r\n\r\n"Carelessness!" said the professor. "Now you may tell us why you like to\r\nthrow stones at us."\r\n\r\n"To see you jump," said Bobby, honestly.\r\n\r\n"Thoughtlessness!" said the professor. "That\'s worse."\r\n\r\n"Why do you kick us, instead of lifting us gently when we are in your\r\nway?" inquired a toad in a stern voice.\r\n\r\n"Because you will give me warts if I touch you," said Bobby, pleased to\r\nthink that he had a good reason at last.\r\n\r\n"Ignorance!" cried the professor. "The toad is absolutely harmless. It\r\nhas about it a liquid that might cause pain to a cut finger or a\r\nsensitive tissue like that of the mouth or eye, but the old story that a\r\ntoad is poisonous is a silly fable."\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me, please," asked a toad in a plaintive voice, "if you\r\nare the boy who, last year, carried home some of my babies in a tin pail\r\nand let them die?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I am," said Bobby, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n"Do explain why you dislike us!" said Mrs. Bufo in such a frank fashion\r\nthat Bobby felt that he must tell the truth.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it\'s your looks," said the boy, unable to frame his answer in\r\nmore polite terms.\r\n\r\n"Well, upon my word!" interrupted the professor. "I thought better of a\r\nboy than that. So you prefer boys with pretty faces and soft, curling\r\nhair, and nice clothes, to those who can climb and jump and who are not\r\nafraid of a day\'s tramp in the woods."\r\n\r\n"Of course I don\'t," said indignant Bobby. "I hate boys who are always\r\nthinking about their clothes."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you do!" said the frog. "Now answer me a few more questions. Have\r\nyou ever stolen birds\' eggs?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said truthful Bobby.\r\n\r\n"Have you collected butterflies?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Bobby.\r\n\r\n"Have you taken nuts from the squirrels\' cupboards?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Bobby.\r\n\r\n"Do you think we ought to have a very friendly feeling towards you?"\r\nwent on the questioner.\r\n\r\n"No," said Bobby; "I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"We have shown that you are not only useless, but careless and\r\nthoughtless and ignorant," said the frog. "Is there any very good reason\r\nwhy we should let you go?"\r\n\r\nPoor Bobby racked his brains to think of something that should appeal to\r\nhis captors.\r\n\r\n"I have a right to live, haven\'t I?" he said at last.\r\n\r\n"Because you are so pretty?" suggested the professor, and Bobby\'s eyes\r\nfell with shame.\r\n\r\n"Any better right than we have?" came a chorus of voices. Bobby was\r\nsilent. He felt very helpless and insignificant. There was a long pause.\r\nThen the frog professor smiled broadly at Bobby.\r\n\r\n"Come," he said; "I like you. You are not afraid to be honest, and\r\nthat\'s something."\r\n\r\n"If you will let me go," said Bobby, "I\'ll see that the boys don\'t hurt\r\nyou any more."\r\n\r\n"I felt pretty sure that we\'d converted you," said the professor; "and\r\nI\'m going to let you go back and preach to the heathen, as the grown\r\npeople say. You can see for yourself how much harm a boy can do if he\r\ndoesn\'t think."\r\n\r\nBobby felt that he was free, and scrambled to his feet, rubbing first\r\none arm and then the other to take the prickly feeling out of them. The\r\nfrogs had vanished; there was only the blue sky, the waving pine tree,\r\nand the quiet pond.\r\n\r\n"Well!" said Bobby with a long breath of amazement.\r\n\r\n"Kerjunk!" came the warning voice of a frog, somewhere near the water\'s\r\nedge.\r\n\r\n"Yes sir, I\'ll remember," said Bobby in the meekest of meek tones.\r\n\r\nM.

The world\'s astir;\r\n    The would-be green has word of her;\r\n    Root and germ have heard of her,\r\n      Coming to break\r\n      Their sleep and wake\r\n    Their hearts with every bird of her.\r\n\r\n    See! see! How swift concur\r\n    Sun, wind, and rain at the name of her,\r\n    A-wondering what became of her;\r\n    The fields flower at the flame of her;\r\n      The glad air sings\r\n      With dancing wings\r\n    And the silvery shrill acclaim of her.\r\n\r\nCHARLES G. D. ROBERTS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDRA THE QUEEN MOTHER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE CRICKETS BROUGHT GOOD FORTUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friend Jacques went into a baker\'s shop one day to buy a little cake\r\nwhich he had fancied in passing. He intended it for a child whose\r\nappetite was gone, and who could be coaxed to eat only by amusing him.\r\nHe thought that such a pretty loaf might tempt even the sick. While he\r\nwaited for his change, a little boy six or eight years old, in poor but\r\nperfectly clean clothes, entered the baker\'s shop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO]\r\n\r\n"Ma\'am," said he to the baker\'s wife, "Mother sent me for a loaf of\r\nbread." The woman took from the shelf a four-pound loaf, the best one\r\nshe could find, and put it into the arms of the little boy.\r\n\r\nMy friend Jacques then first observed the thin and thoughtful face of\r\nthe little fellow. It contrasted strongly with the round, open\r\ncountenance of the large loaf, of which he was taking the greatest care.\r\n\r\n"Have you any money?" said the baker\'s wife.\r\n\r\nThe little boy\'s eyes grew sad.\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am," said he, hugging the loaf closer to his thin blouse; "but\r\nmother told me to say that she would come and speak to you about it\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Run along," said the good woman; "carry your bread home, child."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, ma\'am," said the poor little fellow.\r\n\r\nMy friend Jacques came forward for his money. He had put his purchase\r\ninto his pocket, and was about to go, when he found the child with the\r\nbig loaf, whom he had supposed to be half-way home, standing stock-still\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing there?" said the baker\'s wife to the child, whom she\r\nalso had thought to be fairly off. "Don\'t you like the bread?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, ma\'am!" said the child.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, carry it to your mother, my little friend. If you wait any\r\nlonger, she will think you are playing by the way, and you will get a\r\nscolding."\r\n\r\nThe child did not seem to hear. Something else absorbed his attention.\r\n\r\nThe baker\'s wife went up to him and gave him a friendly tap on the\r\nshoulder. "What are you thinking about?" said she.\r\n\r\n"Ma\'am," said the little boy, "what is that that sings?"\r\n\r\n"There is no singing," said she.\r\n\r\n"Yes!" cried the little fellow. "Hear it! Queek, queek, queek, queek!"\r\n\r\nMy friend and the woman both listened, but they could hear nothing,\r\nunless it was the song of the crickets, frequent guests in bakers\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n"It is a little bird," said the dear little fellow; "or perhaps the\r\nbread sings when it bakes, as apples do?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, little goosey!" said the baker\'s wife; "those are crickets.\r\nThey sing in the bake-house because we are lighting the oven, and they\r\nlike to see the fire."\r\n\r\n"Crickets!" said the child; "are they really crickets?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure," said she, good-humouredly. The child\'s face lighted\r\nup.\r\n\r\n"Ma\'am," said he, blushing at the boldness of his request, "I would like\r\nit very much if you would give me a cricket."\r\n\r\n"A cricket," said the baker\'s wife, smiling; "what in the world would\r\nyou do with a cricket, my little friend? I would gladly give you all\r\nthere are in the house, to get rid of them, they run about so."\r\n\r\n"O, ma\'am, give me one, only one, if you please!" said the child,\r\nclasping his little thin hands under the big loaf. "They say that\r\ncrickets bring good luck into houses; and perhaps if we had one at home,\r\nmother, who has so much trouble, wouldn\'t cry any more."\r\n\r\n"Why does your poor mamma cry?" said my friend, who could no longer help\r\njoining in the conversation.\r\n\r\n"On account of her bills, sir," said the little fellow. "Father is dead,\r\nand mother works very hard, but she cannot pay them all."\r\n\r\nMy friend took the child, and with him the large loaf, into his arms,\r\nand I really believe he kissed them both. Meanwhile the baker\'s wife,\r\nwho did not dare to touch a cricket herself, had gone into the\r\nbake-house. She made her husband catch four, and put them into a box\r\nwith holes in the cover, so that they might breathe. She gave the box to\r\nthe child, who went away perfectly happy.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, the baker\'s wife and my friend gave each other a good\r\nsqueeze of the hand. "Poor little fellow!" said they both together. Then\r\nshe took down her account-book, and, finding the page where the mother\'s\r\ncharges were written, made a great dash all down the page, and then\r\nwrote at the bottom, "Paid."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my friend, to lose no time, had put up in paper all the money\r\nin his pockets, where fortunately he had quite a sum that day, and had\r\nbegged the good wife to send it at once to the mother of the little\r\ncricket-boy, with her bill receipted, and a note, in which he told her\r\nthat she had a son who would one day be her pride and joy.\r\n\r\nThey gave it to a baker\'s boy with long legs, and told him to make\r\nhaste. The child, with his big loaf, his four crickets, and his little\r\nshort legs, could not run very fast, so that when he reached home, he\r\nfound his mother, for the first time in many weeks, with her eyes raised\r\nfrom her work, and a smile of peace and happiness upon her lips.\r\n\r\nThe boy believed that it was the arrival of his four little black things\r\nwhich had worked this miracle, and I do not think he was mistaken.\r\nWithout the crickets, and his good little heart, would this happy change\r\nhave taken place in his mother\'s fortunes?\r\n\r\nP. J. STAHL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF BLENHEIM\r\n\r\n\r\n    It was a summer evening,\r\n      Old Kaspar\'s work was done,\r\n    And he before his cottage door\r\n      Was sitting in the sun,\r\n    And by him sported on the green\r\n    His little grandchild Wilhelmine.\r\n\r\n    She saw her brother Peterkin\r\n      Roll something large and round,\r\n    Which he beside the rivulet\r\n      In playing there had found:\r\n    He came to ask what he had found,\r\n    That was so large, and smooth, and round.\r\n\r\n    Old Kaspar took it from the boy,\r\n      Who stood expectant by:\r\n    And then the old man shook his head,\r\n      And, with a natural sigh,\r\n    "\'Tis some poor fellow\'s skull," said he,\r\n    "Who fell in the great victory.\r\n\r\n    "I find them in the garden,\r\n      For there\'s many here about;\r\n    And often when I go to plough,\r\n      The ploughshare turns them out!\r\n    For many thousand men," said he,\r\n    "Were slain in that great victory."\r\n\r\n    "Now tell me what \'twas all about,"\r\n      Young Peterkin, he cries;\r\n    And little Wilhelmine looks up\r\n      With wonder-waiting eyes;\r\n    "Now tell us all about the war,\r\n    And what they fought each other for."\r\n\r\n    "It was the English," Kaspar cried,\r\n      "Who put the French to rout;\r\n    But what they fought each other for,\r\n      I could not well make out;\r\n    But everybody said," quoth he,\r\n    "That \'twas a famous victory.\r\n\r\n    "My father lived at Blenheim then,\r\n      Yon little stream hard by;\r\n    They burnt his dwelling to the ground,\r\n      And he was forced to fly;\r\n    So with his wife and child he fled,\r\n    Nor had he where to rest his head.\r\n\r\n    "They say it was a shocking sight\r\n      After the field was won;\r\n    For many thousand bodies here\r\n      Lay rotting in the sun;\r\n    But things like that, you know, must be\r\n    After a famous victory.\r\n\r\n    "Great praise the Duke of Marlbro\' won,\r\n      And our good prince Eugene."\r\n    "Why \'twas a very wicked thing!"\r\n      Said little Wilhelmine.\r\n    "Nay, nay, my little girl," quoth he,\r\n    "It was a famous victory.\r\n\r\n    "And everybody praised the Duke\r\n      Who this great fight did win."\r\n    "But what good came of it at last?"\r\n      Quoth little Peterkin.\r\n    "Why, that I cannot tell," said he,\r\n    "But \'twas a famous victory."\r\n\r\nSOUTHEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIDE FOR LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nAway off towards the swamp, which they were avoiding, the long,\r\nheart-chilling cry of a mother-wolf quavered on the still night air. In\r\nspite of herself, Mrs. Murray shivered, and the boys looked at each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"There is only one," said Ranald in a low voice to Don, but they both\r\nknew that where the she-wolf is there is a pack not far off. "And we\r\nwill be through the bush in five minutes."\r\n\r\n"Come, Ranald! Come away, you can talk to Don any time. Good-night,\r\nDon." And so saying she headed her pony toward the clearing and was off\r\nat a gallop, and Ranald, shaking his head at his friend, ejaculated:\r\n\r\n"Man alive! what do you think of that?" and was off after the pony.\r\n\r\nTogether they entered the bush. The road was well beaten and the horses\r\nwere keen to go, so that before many minutes were over they were half\r\nthrough the bush. Ranald\'s spirits rose and he began to take some\r\ninterest in his companion\'s observations upon the beauty of the lights\r\nand shadows falling across their path.\r\n\r\n"Look at that very dark shadow from the spruce there, Ranald," she\r\ncried, pointing to a deep, black turn in the road. For answer there came\r\nfrom behind them the long, mournful hunting-cry of the wolf. He was on\r\ntheir track. Immediately it was answered by a chorus of howls from the\r\nbush on the swamp side, but still far away. There was no need of\r\ncommand; the pony sprang forward with a snort and the colt followed, and\r\nafter a few minutes\' running, passed her.\r\n\r\n"Whow-oo-oo-oo-ow," rose the long cry of the pursuer, summoning help,\r\nand drawing nearer.\r\n\r\n"Whw-ee-wow," came the shorter, sharper answer from the swamp, but much\r\nnearer than before and more in front. They were trying to head off their\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nRanald tugged at his colt till he got him back with the pony.\r\n\r\n"It is a good road," he said, quietly; "you can let the pony go. I will\r\nfollow you." He swung in behind the pony, who was now running for dear\r\nlife and snorting with terror at every jump.\r\n\r\n"God preserve us!" said Ranald to himself. He had caught sight of a dark\r\nform as it darted through the gleam of light in front.\r\n\r\n"What did you say, Ranald?" The voice was quiet and clear.\r\n\r\n"It is a great pony to run," said Ranald, ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\n"Is she not?"\r\n\r\nRanald glanced over his shoulder. Down the road, running with silent,\r\nawful swiftness, he saw the long, low body of the leading wolf flashing\r\nthrough the bars of moonlight across the road, and the pack following\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n"Let her go, Mrs. Murray," cried Ranald. "Whip her and never stop." But\r\nthere was no need; the pony was wild with fear, and was doing her best\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\nRanald meantime was gradually holding in the colt, and the pony drew\r\naway rapidly. But as rapidly the wolves were closing in behind him. They\r\nwere not more than a hundred yards away, and gaining every second.\r\nRanald, remembering the suspicious nature of the brutes, loosened his\r\ncoat and dropped it on the road; with a chorus of yelps they paused,\r\nthen threw themselves upon it, and in another minute took up the chase.\r\n\r\nBut now the clearing was in sight. The pony was far ahead, and Ranald\r\nshook out his colt with a yell. He was none too soon, for the pursuing\r\npack, now uttering short, shrill yelps, were close at the colt\'s heels.\r\nLizette, fleet as the wind, could not shake them off. Closer and ever\r\ncloser they came, snapping and snarling. Ranald could see them over his\r\nshoulder. A hundred yards more and he would reach his own back lane. The\r\nleader of the pack seemed to feel that his chances were slipping swiftly\r\naway. With a spurt he gained upon Lizette, reached the saddle-girths,\r\ngathered himself into two short jumps, and sprang for the colt\'s throat.\r\nInstinctively Ranald stood up in his stirrups, and kicking his foot\r\nfree, caught the wolf under the jaw. The brute fell with a howl under\r\nthe colt\'s feet, and next moment they were in the lane and safe.\r\n\r\nThe savage brutes, discouraged by their leader\'s fall, slowed down their\r\nfierce pursuit, and hearing the deep bay of the Macdonalds\' great\r\ndeer-hound, Bugle, up at the house, they paused, sniffed the air a few\r\nminutes, then turned and swiftly and silently slid into the dark\r\nshadows. Ranald, knowing that they would hardly dare enter the lane,\r\nchecked the colt, and wheeling, watched them disappear.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have some of your hides some day," he cried, shaking his fist\r\nafter them. He hated to be made to run.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly set the colt\'s face homeward when he heard something\r\ntearing down the lane to meet him. The colt snorted, swerved, and then\r\ndropping his ears, stood still. It was Bugle, and after him came Mrs.\r\nMurray on the pony.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ranald!" she panted, "thank God you are safe. I was afraid\r\nyou--you--" Her voice broke in sobs. Her hood had fallen back from her\r\nwhite face, and her eyes were shining like two stars. She laid her hand\r\non Ranald\'s arm, and her voice grew steady as she said: "Thank God, my\r\nboy, and thank you with all my heart. You risked your life for mine. You\r\nare a brave fellow! I can never forget this!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, pshaw!" said Ranald, awkwardly. "You are better stuff than I am.\r\nYou came back with Bugle. And I knew Liz could beat the pony." Then they\r\nwalked their horses quietly to the stable, and nothing more was said by\r\neither of them; but from that hour Ranald had a friend ready to offer\r\nlife for him, though he did not know it then nor till years afterward.\r\n\r\nRALPH CONNOR: "The Man from Glengarry."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nST.

Up from the street, while the crew of the\r\ntruck company were labouring with the heavy extension ladder that at its\r\nlongest stretch was many feet too short, crept four men upon long,\r\nslender poles with cross-bars, iron-hooked at the end. Standing in one\r\nwindow, they reached up and thrust the hook through the next one above,\r\nthen mounted a story higher. Again the crash of glass, and again the\r\ndizzy ascent. Straight up the wall they crept, looking like human flies\r\non the ceiling, and clinging as close, never resting, reaching one\r\nrecess only to set out for the next; nearer and nearer in the race for\r\nlife, until but a single span separated the foremost from the boy. And\r\nnow the iron hook fell at his feet, and the fireman stood upon the step\r\nwith the rescued lad in his arms, just as the pent-up flames burst lurid\r\nfrom the attic window, reaching with impotent fury for their prey. The\r\nnext moment they were safe upon the great ladder waiting to receive them\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThen such a shout went up! Men fell on each other\'s necks, and cried and\r\nlaughed at once. Strangers slapped one another on the back with\r\nglistening faces, shook hands, and behaved generally like men gone\r\nsuddenly mad. Women wept in the street. The driver of a car stalled in\r\nthe crowd, who had stood through it all speechless, clutching the reins,\r\nwhipped his horses into a gallop and drove away, yelling like a\r\nComanche, to relieve his feelings. The boy and his rescuer were carried\r\nacross the street without anyone knowing how. Policemen forgot their\r\ndignity and shouted with the rest. Fire, peril, terror, and loss were\r\nalike forgotten in the one touch of nature that makes the whole world\r\nkin.\r\n\r\nFireman John Binns was made captain of his crew, and the Bennett medal\r\nwas pinned on his coat on the next parade day.\r\n\r\nJACOB A. RIIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whene\'er a noble deed is wrought,\r\n    Whene\'er is spoken a noble thought,\r\n      Our hearts in glad surprise\r\n      To higher levels rise.\r\n\r\nLONGFELLOW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUEST\r\n\r\n\r\n        There once was a restless boy\r\n          Who dwelt in a home by the sea,\r\n        Where the water danced for joy,\r\n          And the wind was glad and free;\r\n    But he said: "Good mother, O let me go!\r\n    For the dullest place in the world, I know,\r\n          Is this little brown house,\r\n          This old brown house,\r\n          Under the apple tree.\r\n\r\n        "I will travel east and west;\r\n          The loveliest homes I\'ll see;\r\n        And when I have found the best,\r\n          Dear mother, I\'ll come for thee.\r\n    I\'ll come for thee in a year and a day,\r\n    And joyfully then we\'ll haste away\r\n          From this little brown house,\r\n          This old brown house,\r\n          Under the apple tree."\r\n\r\n        So he travelled here and there,\r\n          But never content was he,\r\n        Though he saw in lands most fair\r\n          The costliest homes there be.\r\n    He something missed from the sea or sky,\r\n    Till he turned again with a wistful sigh\r\n          To the little brown house,\r\n          The old brown house,\r\n          Under the apple tree.\r\n\r\n        Then the mother saw and smiled,\r\n          While her heart grew glad and free.\r\n        "Hast thou chosen a home, my child?\r\n          Ah, where shall we dwell?" quoth she.\r\n    And he said: "Sweet mother, from east to west,\r\n    The loveliest home, and the dearest and best,\r\n          Is a little brown house,\r\n          An old brown house,\r\n          Under an apple tree."\r\n\r\nEUDORA S. BUMSTEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JACKAL AND THE PARTRIDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nA Jackal and a Partridge swore eternal friendship; but the Jackal was\r\nvery exacting and jealous. "You don\'t do half as much for me as I do for\r\nyou," he used to say, "and yet you talk a great deal of your friendship.\r\nNow my idea of a friend is one who is able to make me laugh or cry,\r\ngive me a good meal, or save my life if need be. You couldn\'t do that!"\r\n\r\n"Let us see," answered the Partridge; "follow me at a little distance,\r\nand if I don\'t make you laugh soon you may eat me!"\r\n\r\nSo she flew on till she met two travellers trudging along, one behind\r\nthe other. They were both foot-sore and weary, and the first carried his\r\nbundle on a stick over his shoulder, while the second had his shoes in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nLightly as a feather the Partridge settled on the first traveller\'s\r\nstick. He, none the wiser, trudged on; but the second traveller, seeing\r\nthe bird sitting so tamely just in front of his nose, said to himself:\r\n"What a chance for a supper!" and immediately flung his shoes at it,\r\nthey being ready to hand. Whereupon the Partridge flew away, and the\r\nshoes knocked off the first traveller\'s turban.\r\n\r\n"What a plague do you mean?" cried he, angrily turning on his companion.\r\n"Why did you throw your shoes at my head?"\r\n\r\n"Brother!" replied the other, mildly, "do not be vexed. I didn\'t throw\r\nthem at you, but at a Partridge that was sitting on your stick."\r\n\r\n"On my stick! Do you take me for a fool?" shouted the injured man, in a\r\ngreat rage. "Don\'t tell me such cock-and-bull stories. First you insult\r\nme, and then you lie like a coward; but I\'ll teach you manners!"\r\n\r\nThen he fell upon his fellow-traveller without more ado, and they fought\r\nuntil they could not see out of their eyes, till their noses were\r\nbleeding, their clothes in rags, and the Jackal had nearly died of\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n"Are you satisfied?" asked the Partridge of her friend.\r\n\r\n"Well," answered the Jackal, "you have certainly made me laugh, but I\r\ndoubt if you could make me cry. It is easy enough to be a buffoon; it is\r\nmore difficult to excite the higher emotions."\r\n\r\n"Let us see," retorted the Partridge, somewhat piqued; "there is a\r\nhuntsman with his dogs coming along the road. Just creep into that\r\nhollow tree and watch me; if you don\'t weep scalding tears, you must\r\nhave no feeling in you!"\r\n\r\nThe Jackal did as he was bid, and watched the Partridge, who began\r\nfluttering about the bushes till the dogs caught sight of her, when she\r\nflew to the hollow tree where the Jackal was hidden. Of course the dogs\r\nsmelled him at once, and set up such a yelping and scratching that the\r\nhuntsman came up and, seeing what it was, dragged the Jackal out by the\r\ntail. Whereupon the dogs worried him to their hearts\' content, and\r\nfinally left him for dead.\r\n\r\nBy and by he opened his eyes--for he was only foxing--and saw the\r\nPartridge sitting on a branch above him.\r\n\r\n"Did you cry?" she asked anxiously. "Did I rouse your higher emo--"\r\n\r\n"Be quiet, will you!" snarled the Jackal; "I\'m half-dead with fear!"\r\n\r\nSo there the Jackal lay for some time, getting the better of his\r\nbruises, and meanwhile he became hungry.\r\n\r\n"Now is the time for friendship!" said he to the Partridge. "Get me a\r\ngood dinner, and I will acknowledge you are a true friend."\r\n\r\n"Very well!" replied the Partridge; "only watch me, and help yourself\r\nwhen the time comes."\r\n\r\nJust then a troop of women came by, carrying their husbands\' dinners to\r\nthe harvest-field.\r\n\r\nThe Partridge gave a little plaintive cry, and began fluttering along\r\nfrom bush to bush as if she were wounded.\r\n\r\n"A wounded bird!--a wounded bird!" cried the women; "we can easily catch\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nWhereupon they set off in pursuit, but the cunning Partridge played a\r\nthousand tricks, till they became so excited over the chase that they\r\nput their bundles on the ground in order to pursue it more nimbly. The\r\nJackal, meanwhile, seizing his opportunity, crept up, and made off with\r\na good dinner.\r\n\r\n"Are you satisfied now?" asked the Partridge.\r\n\r\n"Well," returned the Jackal, "I confess you have given me a very good\r\ndinner; you have also made me laugh--and cry--ahem! But, after all, the\r\ngreat test of friendship is beyond you--you couldn\'t save my life!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not," acquiesced the Partridge, mournfully. "I am so small and\r\nweak. But it grows late--we should be going home; and as it is a long\r\nway round by the ford, let us go across the river. My friend, the\r\ncrocodile, will carry us over."\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they set off for the river, and the crocodile kindly\r\nconsented to carry them across; so they sat on his broad back, and he\r\nferried them over. But just as they were in the middle of the stream the\r\nPartridge remarked: "I believe the crocodile intends to play us a trick.\r\nHow awkward if he were to drop you into the water!"\r\n\r\n"Awkward for you, too!" replied the Jackal, turning pale.\r\n\r\n"Not at all! not at all! I have wings, you haven\'t."\r\n\r\nOn this the Jackal shivered and shook with fear, and when the crocodile,\r\nin a grewsome growl, remarked that he was hungry and wanted a good meal,\r\nthe wretched creature hadn\'t a word to say.\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" cried the Partridge, airily, "don\'t try tricks on us--I should\r\nfly away, and as for my friend, the Jackal, you couldn\'t hurt _him_. He\r\nis not such a fool as to take his life with him on these little\r\nexcursions; he leaves it at home locked up in the cupboard."\r\n\r\n"Is that a fact?" asked the crocodile, surprised.\r\n\r\n"Certainly!" retorted the Partridge. "Try to eat him if you like, but\r\nyou will only tire yourself to no purpose."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! how very odd!" gasped the crocodile; and he was so taken aback\r\nthat he carried the Jackal safe to shore.\r\n\r\n"Well, are you satisfied now?" asked the Partridge.\r\n\r\n"My dear madam!" quoth the Jackal, "you have made me laugh, you have\r\nmade me cry, you have given me a good dinner, and you have saved my\r\nlife; but upon my honour I think you are too clever for a friend: so,\r\ngood-bye!"\r\n\r\nAnd the Jackal never went near the Partridge again.\r\n\r\nFLORA ANNIE STEEL: "Tales from the Punjab."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK\r\n\r\n\r\n    All the trees are sleeping, all the winds are still,\r\n    All the flocks of fleecy clouds have wandered past the hill;\r\n    Through the noonday silence, down the woods of June,\r\n    Hark! a little hunter\'s voice comes running with a tune.\r\n\r\n                "Hide and seek!\r\n                "When I speak,\r\n                "You must answer me:\r\n                "Call again,\r\n                "Merry men,\r\n              "Coo-ee, coo-ee, coo-ee!"\r\n\r\n    Now I hear his footsteps, rustling through the grass:\r\n    Hidden in my leafy nook, shall I let him pass?\r\n    Just a low, soft whistle,--quick the hunter turns,\r\n    Leaps upon me laughing, rolls me in the ferns.\r\n\r\n                "Hold him fast,\r\n                "Caught at last!\r\n                "Now you\'re it, you see.\r\n                "Hide your eye,\r\n                "Till I cry,\r\n              "Coo-ee, coo-ee, coo-ee!"\r\n\r\n    Long ago he left me, long and long ago:\r\n    Now I wander through the world and seek him high and low;\r\n    Hidden safe and happy, in some pleasant place,--\r\n    Ah, if I could hear his voice, I soon should find his face.\r\n\r\n                Far away,\r\n                Many a day,\r\n                Where can Barney be?\r\n                Answer, dear,\r\n                Don\'t you hear?\r\n              "Coo-ee, coo-ee, coo-ee!"\r\n\r\n    Birds that in the spring-time thrilled his heart with joy,\r\n    Flowers he loved to pick for me, \'mind me of my boy.\r\n    Surely he is waiting till my steps come nigh;\r\n    Love may hide itself awhile, but love can never die.\r\n\r\n                Heart be glad,\r\n                The little lad\r\n                Will call some day to thee:\r\n                "Father dear,\r\n                "Heaven is here,\r\n              "Coo-ee, coo-ee, coo-ee!"\r\n\r\nHENRY VAN DYKE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BURNING OF THE "GOLIATH"\r\n\r\n     (Owing to the excellent discipline which Captain Bourchier had\r\n     established, and to the courage of the boys, only twelve lives\r\n     were lost out of the crew of five hundred).\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me give you an example of self-denial which comes from near home. I\r\nwill speak to you of what has been done by little boys of seven, of\r\neight, of twelve, of thirteen;--little English boys, and English boys\r\nwith very few advantages of birth; not brought up, as most of you are,\r\nin quiet, orderly homes, but taken from the London workhouses. I will\r\nspeak to you of what such little boys have done, not fifteen hundred, or\r\neven two hundred years ago, but last week--last Wednesday, on the river\r\nThames.\r\n\r\nDo you know of whom I am thinking? I am thinking of the little boys,\r\nnearly five hundred, who were taken from different workhouses in London,\r\nand put to school to be trained as sailors on board the ship which was\r\ncalled after the name of the giant whom David slew--the training-ship\r\nGoliath.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o\'clock on Wednesday morning that great ship suddenly caught\r\nfire, from the upsetting of a can of oil in the lamp-room. It was hardly\r\ndaylight. In a very few minutes the ship was on fire from one end to the\r\nother, and the fire-bell rang to call the boys to their posts. What did\r\nthey do? Think of the sudden surprise, the sudden danger--the flames\r\nrushing all around them, and the dark, cold water below them! Did they\r\ncry, or scream, or fly about in confusion? No; they ran each to his\r\nproper place.\r\n\r\nThey had been trained to do that--they knew that it was their duty; and\r\nno one forgot himself; no one lost his presence of mind. They all, as\r\nthe captain said: "behaved like men." Then, when it was found impossible\r\nto save the ship, those who could swim jumped into the water by order of\r\nthe captain, and swam for their lives. Some, also at his command, got\r\ninto a boat; and then, when the sheets of flame and the clouds of smoke\r\ncame pouring out of the ship, the smaller boys for a moment were\r\nfrightened, and wanted to push away.\r\n\r\nBut there was one among them--the little mate: his name was William\r\nBolton: we are proud that he came from Westminster: a quiet boy, much\r\nloved by his comrades--who had the sense and courage to say: "No; we\r\nmust stay and help those that are still in the ship." He kept the barge\r\nalongside the ship as long as possible, and was thus the means of saving\r\nmore than one hundred lives!\r\n\r\nThere were others who were still in the ship while the flames went on\r\nspreading. They were standing by the good captain, who had been so kind\r\nto them all, and whom they all loved so much. In that dreadful crisis\r\nthey thought more of him than of themselves. One threw his arms round\r\nhis neck and said: "You\'ll be burnt, Captain;" and another said: "Save\r\nyourself before the rest." But the captain gave them the best of all\r\nlessons for that moment. He said: "That\'s not the way at sea, my boys."\r\n\r\nHe meant to say--and they quite understood what he meant--that the way\r\nat sea is to prepare for danger beforehand, to meet it manfully when it\r\ncomes, and to look at the safety, not of oneself, but of others. The\r\ncaptain had not only learned that good old way himself, but he also knew\r\nhow to teach it to the boys under his charge.\r\n\r\nDEAN STANLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARTS OF OAK\r\n\r\n\r\n    Come, cheer up, my lads, \'tis to glory we steer,\r\n    To add something more to this wonderful year,\r\n    To honour we call you, not press you like slaves,\r\n    For who are so free as the sons of the waves?\r\n    Hearts of oak are our ships, hearts of oak are our men,\r\n            We always are ready,\r\n            Steady, boys, steady,\r\n    We\'ll fight and we\'ll conquer again and again.\r\n\r\n    Still Britain shall triumph, her ships plough the sea,\r\n    Her standard be justice, her watchword "Be free;"\r\n    Then, cheer up, my lads, with one heart let us sing\r\n    Our soldiers, our sailors, our statesmen, our king.\r\n    Hearts of oak are our ships, hearts of oak are our men,\r\n            We always are ready,\r\n            Steady, boys, steady,\r\n    We\'ll fight and we\'ll conquer again and again.\r\n\r\nDAVID GARRICK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WET SHEET AND A FLOWING SEA\r\n\r\n\r\n    A wet sheet and a flowing sea,\r\n      A wind that follows fast,\r\n    And fills the white and rustling sail,\r\n      And bends the gallant mast;\r\n    And bends the gallant mast, my boys,\r\n      While, like the eagle free,\r\n    Away the good ship flies, and leaves\r\n      Old England on the lee!\r\n\r\n    "O for a soft and gentle wind!"\r\n      I heard a fair one cry;\r\n    But give to me the snoring breeze\r\n      And white waves heaving high;\r\n    And white waves heaving high, my boys,\r\n      The good ship tight and free,--\r\n    The world of waters is our home,\r\n      And merry men are we.\r\n\r\n    There\'s tempest in yon horn\xc3\xa8d moon,\r\n      And lightning in yon cloud;\r\n    And hark the music, mariners,\r\n      The wind is piping loud!\r\n    The wind is piping loud, my boys,\r\n      The lightning flashes free,--\r\n    While the hollow oak our palace is,\r\n      Our heritage the sea.\r\n\r\nALLAN CUNNINGHAM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TALENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who\r\ncalled his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. And unto one\r\nhe gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man\r\naccording to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.\r\n\r\nThen he that had received the five talents went and traded with the\r\nsame, and made them other five talents. And likewise he that had\r\nreceived two, he also gained other two. But he that had received one\r\nwent and digged in the earth, and hid his lord\'s money. After a long\r\ntime the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.\r\n\r\nAnd so he that had received five talents came and brought other five\r\ntalents saying, "Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I\r\nhave gained beside them five talents more." His lord said unto him,\r\n"Well done, thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over\r\na few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into\r\nthe joy of thy lord."\r\n\r\nHe also that had received two talents came and said, "Lord, thou\r\ndeliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents\r\nbeside them." His lord said unto him, "Well done, good and faithful\r\nservant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee\r\nruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."\r\n\r\nThen he which had received the one talent came and said, "Lord, I knew\r\nthee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and\r\ngathering where thou hast not strawed; and I was afraid, and went and\r\nhid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine." His\r\nlord answered and said unto him, "Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou\r\nknewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not\r\nstrawed: thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the\r\nexchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with\r\nusury. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which\r\nhath ten talents. For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he\r\nshall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away\r\neven that which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer\r\ndarkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."\r\n\r\nST.

No common words either,\r\nbut out-and-out book-talk. You never see a jay at a loss for a word.\r\n\r\n"You may call a jay a bird. Well, so he is, because he has feathers on\r\nhim. Otherwise, he is just as human as you are.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; a jay is everything that a man is. A jay can laugh, a jay can\r\ngossip, a jay can feel ashamed, just as well as you do, maybe better.\r\nAnd there\'s another thing: in good, clean, out-and-out scolding, a\r\nbluejay can beat anything alive.\r\n\r\n"Seven years ago the last man about here but me moved away. There stands\r\nhis house--a log house with just one big room and no more: no ceiling,\r\nnothing between the rafters and the floor.\r\n\r\n"Well, one Sunday morning I was sitting out here in front of my cabin,\r\nwith my cat, taking the sun, when a bluejay flew down on that house with\r\nan acorn in his mouth.\r\n\r\n"\'Hello,\' says he, \'I reckon here\'s something.\' When he spoke, the acorn\r\nfell out of his mouth and rolled down on the roof. He didn\'t care; his\r\nmind was on the thing he had found.\r\n\r\n"It was a knot-hole in the roof. He cocked his head to one side, shut\r\none eye, and put the other to the hole, like a \'possum looking down a\r\njug.\'\r\n\r\n"Then he looked up, gave a wink or two with his wings, and says: \'It\r\nlooks like a hole, it\'s placed like a hole--and--if I don\'t think it is\r\na hole!\'\r\n\r\n"Then he cocked his head down and took another look. He looked up with\r\njoy, this time winked his wings and his tail both, and says: \'If I ain\'t\r\nin luck! Why it\'s an elegant hole!\'\r\n\r\n"So he flew down and got that acorn and dropped it in, and was tilting\r\nhis head back with a smile when a queer look of surprise came over his\r\nface. Then he says: \'Why, I didn\'t hear it fall.\'\r\n\r\n"He cocked his eye at the hole again and took a long look; rose up and\r\nshook his head; went to the other side of the hole and took another look\r\nfrom that side; shook his head again. No use.\r\n\r\n"So after thinking awhile, he says: \'I reckon it\'s all right. I\'ll try\r\nit, anyway.\'\r\n\r\n"So he flew off and brought another acorn and dropped it in, and tried\r\nto get his eye to the hole quick enough to see what became of it. He was\r\ntoo late. He got another acorn and tried to see where it went, but he\r\ncouldn\'t.\r\n\r\n"He says: \'Well, I never saw such a hole as this before. I reckon it\'s a\r\nnew kind.\' Then he got angry and walked up and down the roof. I never\r\nsaw a bird take on so.\r\n\r\n"When he got through, he looked in the hole for half a minute; then he\r\nsays: \'Well, you\'re a long hole, and a deep hole, and a queer hole, but\r\nI have started to fill you, and I\'ll do it if it takes a hundred\r\nyears.\'\r\n\r\n"And with that away he went. For two hours and a half you never saw a\r\nbird work so hard. He did not stop to look in any more, but just threw\r\nacorns in and went for more.\r\n\r\n"Well, at last he could hardly flap his wings he was so tired out. So he\r\nbent down for a look. He looked up, pale with rage. He says: \'I\'ve put\r\nin enough acorns to keep the family thirty years, and I can\'t see a sign\r\nof them.\'\r\n\r\n"Another jay was going by and heard him. So he stopped to ask what was\r\nthe matter. Our jay told him the whole story. Then he went and looked\r\ndown the hole and came back and said: \'How many tons did you put in\r\nthere?\' \'Not less than two,\' said our jay.\r\n\r\n"The other jay looked again, but could not make it out; so he gave a\r\nyell and three more jays came. They all talked at once for awhile, and\r\nthen called in more jays.\r\n\r\n"Pretty soon the air was blue with jays, and every jay put his eye to\r\nthe hole and told what he thought. They looked the house all over, too.\r\nThe door was partly open, and at last one old jay happened to look in.\r\nThere lay the acorns all over the floor.\r\n\r\n"He flapped his wings and gave a yell: \'Come here, everybody! Ha! Ha!\r\nHe\'s been trying to fill a house with acorns!\'\r\n\r\n"As each jay took a look, the fun of the thing struck him, and how he\r\ndid laugh. And for an hour after they roosted on the housetop and trees,\r\nand laughed like human beings. It isn\'t any use to tell me a bluejay\r\nhasn\'t any fun in him. I know better."\r\n\r\nSAMUEL L. CLEMENS (Mark Twain)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CANADIAN CAMPING SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n    A white tent pitched by a glassy lake,\r\n      Well under a shady tree,\r\n    Or by rippling rills from the grand old hills,\r\n      Is the summer home for me.\r\n    I fear no blaze of the noontide rays,\r\n      For the woodland glades are mine,\r\n    The fragrant air, and that perfume rare,\r\n      The odour of forest pine.\r\n\r\n    A cooling plunge at the break of day,\r\n      A paddle, a row, or sail,\r\n    With always a fish for a mid-day dish,\r\n      And plenty of Adam\'s ale.\r\n    With rod or gun, or in hammock swung,\r\n      We glide through the pleasant days;\r\n    When darkness falls on our canvas walls,\r\n      We kindle the camp fire\'s blaze.\r\n\r\n    From out the gloom sails the silv\'ry moon,\r\n      O\'er forests dark and still,\r\n    Now far, now near, ever sad and clear,\r\n      Comes the plaint of the whip-poor-will;\r\n    With song and laugh, and with kindly chaff,\r\n      We startle the birds above,\r\n    Then rest tired heads on our cedar beds,\r\n      To dream of the ones we love.\r\n\r\nSIR J. D. EDGAR: "This Canada of Ours."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARGONAUTS\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, when the building of the ship Argo was finished, the fifty heroes\r\ncame to look upon her, and joy filled their hearts. "Surely," said they,\r\n"this is the greatest ship that ever sailed the sea."\r\n\r\nSo eager were they to make trial of the long oars that some, leaping on\r\nthe shoulders of their comrades and grasping the shrouds, clambered over\r\nthe bulwarks upon the thwarts and drew the rest in after them. Orpheus,\r\nupon the mighty shoulders of Jason the leader of the expedition, seized\r\nhold of the arm of the azure-eyed goddess, the figure-head of the ship,\r\nand, as he climbed on board, her whisper reached his ear. "Orpheus, sing\r\nme something." This was the song:\r\n\r\n    "How sweet upon the surge to ride,\r\n    And leap from wave to wave,\r\n    While oars flash fast above the tide\r\n    And lordly tempests rave.\r\n    How sweet it is across the main,\r\n    In wonder-land to roam,\r\n    To win rich treasure, endless fame,\r\n    And earn a welcome home."\r\n\r\nThen the good ship Argo stirred in all her timbers and longing for the\r\nrestless sea came upon her and she rushed headlong down the grooves till\r\nthe lips of the goddess tasted the salt sea spray.\r\n\r\nMany a day they sailed through laughing seas and ever they spoke\r\ntogether of the glory of the Golden Fleece which they hoped to bring\r\nhome from far off Colchis.\r\n\r\nWhen they were come to the land of Colchis, King \xc3\x86etes summoned them to\r\nhis palace. Beside him was seated his daughter, the beautiful witch\r\nmaiden, Medea. She looked upon the Greeks and upon Jason, fairest and\r\nnoblest of them all, and her spirit leaped forth to meet his. And\r\nknowing what lay before them, "surely," she thought, "it were an evil\r\nthing that men so bold and comely should perish."\r\n\r\nWhen Jason demanded the Golden Fleece, the rage of the King rushed up\r\nlike a whirlwind, but he curbed his speech and spake a fair word.\r\n"Choose ye now him who is boldest among you and let him perform the\r\nlabours I shall set."\r\n\r\nThat night Medea stole from the palace to warn the hero of the toils and\r\ndangers that awaited him,--to tame a span of brazen-footed\r\nfire-breathing bulls, with them to plough four acres of unbroken land in\r\nthe field of Ares, to sow the tilth with serpents\' teeth, to slay its\r\ncrop of warriors, to cross a river, and climb a lofty wall, to snatch\r\nthe Fleece from a tree round which lay coiled the sleepless dragon. "How\r\ncan these things be accomplished and that before the setting of another\r\nsun?" But Jason used flattering words, singing the song of Chiron:\r\n\r\n    "No river so deep but an arm may swim,\r\n    No wall so steep but a foot may climb,\r\n    No dragon so dread but a sword may slay,\r\n    No fiend so fierce but your charms may stay."\r\n\r\nMedea, seeing that he knew not fear, gave him a magic ointment which\r\nshould give him the strength of seven men and protect him from fire and\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nAll the people assembled at sunrise in the field of Ares. When the\r\nfire-breathing bulls saw Jason standing in the middle of the field, fury\r\nshot from their eyes. Fierce was their onset and the multitude waited\r\nbreathless to see what the end would be. As the bulls came on with\r\nlowered heads, and tails in air, Jason leaped nimbly to one side, and\r\nthe monsters shot past him with bellowings that shook the earth. They\r\nturned and Jason poised for the leap. As they passed a second time, he\r\ngrasped the nearest by the horn and lightly vaulted upon its back. The\r\nbull, unused to the burden, sank cowering to the ground. Jason patted\r\nits neck caressing it, and gladly it shared the yoke with its fellow.\r\n\r\nWhen the ground was ploughed and sown with the teeth of the serpent, a\r\nthousand warriors sprang full-armed from the brown earth. Then King\r\n\xc3\x86etes greatly rejoiced, but Medea, trembling at the sight, laid a spell\r\nupon them that they might not clearly distinguish friend from foe.\r\n\r\nOne among them came forth and Jason advanced to meet him, walking with a\r\nhalt. His adversary laughed aloud, but Jason with a mighty bound sprang\r\nupon the shoulders of his enemy and bore him helmetless to the ground.\r\nThe hero quickly replaced the fallen helmet with his own, giving a\r\ngolden helmet for a brazen. The other rose and fled back among his\r\nfellows who, thinking it was Jason come among them, fell upon and slew\r\nhim and strove with each other for the golden helmet until all were\r\nslain but one who, wounded unto death, rose up from the fray and\r\nshouting "Victory" sank upon knee and elbow never to rise again.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the task was quickly accomplished, for Medea by her spells\r\ncast a deep sleep upon the dragon. So the Golden Fleece was won and\r\nbrought once more to Iolchos with a prize still more precious, for Jason\r\nbore home with him Medea, the beautiful witch maiden, who became his\r\nbride and ruled with him, let us hope, many happy years.\r\n\r\nJOHN WAUGH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the elder days of Art,\r\n      Builders wrought with greatest care\r\n    Each minute and unseen part;\r\n      For the Gods see everywhere.\r\n    Let us do our work as well,\r\n      Both the unseen and the seen;\r\n    Make the house, where Gods may dwell,\r\n      Beautiful, entire and clean.\r\n\r\nLONGFELLOW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINSTREL-BOY\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Minstrel-boy to the war is gone,\r\n      In the ranks of death you\'ll find him;\r\n    His father\'s sword he has girded on,\r\n      And his wild harp slung behind him.\r\n    "Land of song!" said the warrior-bard,\r\n      "Tho\' all the world betrays thee,\r\n    _One_ sword, at least, thy rights shall guard,\r\n      _One_ faithful harp shall praise thee!"\r\n\r\n    The Minstrel fell! but the foeman\'s chain\r\n      Could not bring his proud soul under;\r\n    The harp he loved ne\'er spoke again,\r\n      For he tore its chords asunder;\r\n    And said: "No chains shall sully thee,\r\n      Thou soul of love and bravery!\r\n    Thy songs were made for the pure and free,\r\n      They shall never sound in slavery."\r\n\r\nMOORE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,\r\n    In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side;\r\n    Then it is the brave man chooses, while the coward stands aside.\r\n\r\nLOWELL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY ELIZABETH\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth was a little girl with a long name. She was poor, she was\r\nsick, she was ragged, she was dirty, she was cold, she was hungry, she\r\nwas frightened. She had no home, she had no mother, she had no father.\r\nShe had no supper, she had had no dinner, she had had no breakfast. She\r\nhad no place to go and nobody to care where she went.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Mary Elizabeth had not much of anything but a short pink calico\r\ndress, a little red cotton-and-wool shawl, and her long name. Besides\r\nthis, she had a pair of old rubbers, too large for her.\r\n\r\nShe was walking up Washington Street. It was late in the afternoon of a\r\nbitter January day.\r\n\r\n"God made so many people," thought Mary Elizabeth, "He must have made so\r\nmany suppers. Seems as if there\'d ought to be one for one extry little\r\ngirl."\r\n\r\nBut she thought this in a gentle way. She was a very gentle little girl.\r\nAll girls who hadn\'t anything were not like Mary Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo now she was shuffling up Washington Street, not knowing exactly what\r\nto do next,--peeping into people\'s faces, timidly looking away from\r\nthem, heart-sick (for a very little girl can be very heart-sick),\r\ncolder, she thought, every minute, and hungrier each hour than she was\r\nthe hour before.\r\n\r\nThe child left Washington Street at last, where everybody had homes and\r\nsuppers without one extra one to spare for a little girl, and turned\r\ninto a short, bright, showy street, where stood a great hotel.\r\n\r\nWhether the door-keeper was away, or busy, or sick, or careless, or\r\nwhether the head-waiter at the dining-room was so tall that he couldn\'t\r\nsee so short a beggar, or whether the clerk at the desk was so noisy\r\nthat he couldn\'t hear so still a beggar, or however it was, Mary\r\nElizabeth did get in; by the door-keeper, past the head-waiter, under\r\nthe shadow of the clerk, over the smooth, slippery marble floor the\r\nchild crept on.\r\n\r\nShe came to the office door and stood still. She looked around her with\r\nwide eyes. She had never seen a place like that. Lights flashed over it,\r\nmany and bright. Gentlemen sat in it smoking and reading. They were all\r\nwarm. Not one of them looked as if he had had no dinner and no\r\nbreakfast and no supper.\r\n\r\n"How many extry suppers," thought the little girl, "it must ha\' taken to\r\nfeed \'em all. I guess maybe there\'ll be one for me in here."\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth stood in the middle of it, in her pink calico dress and\r\nred plaid shawl. The shawl was tied over her head and about her neck\r\nwith a ragged tippet. Her bare feet showed in the old rubbers. She began\r\nto shuffle about the room, holding out one purple little hand.\r\n\r\nOne or two of the gentlemen laughed; some frowned; more did nothing at\r\nall; most did not notice, or did not seem to notice, the child. One\r\nsaid: "What\'s the matter here?"\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth shuffled on. She went from one to the other, less\r\ntimidly; a kind of desperation had taken possession of her. The odours\r\nfrom the dining-room came in, of strong, hot coffee, and strange roast\r\nmeats. Mary Elizabeth thought of Jo.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her she was so hungry that, if she could not get a supper,\r\nshe should jump up and run and rush about and snatch something and steal\r\nlike Jo. She held out her hand, but only said: "I\'m hungry!"\r\n\r\nA gentleman called her. He was the gentleman who had asked: "What\'s the\r\nmatter here?" He called her in behind his daily paper which was big\r\nenough to hide three of Mary Elizabeth, and when he saw that nobody was\r\nlooking he gave her a five-cent piece in a hurry, as if he had committed\r\na sin, and said quickly: "There, there, child! go now, go!"\r\n\r\nThen he began to read his newspaper quite hard and fast and to look\r\nsevere, as one does who never gives anything to beggars, as a matter of\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nBut nobody else gave anything to Mary Elizabeth. She shuffled from one\r\nto another, hopelessly. Every gentleman shook his head. One called for a\r\nwaiter to put her out. This frightened her and she stood still.\r\n\r\nOver by a window, in a lonely corner of the great room, a young man was\r\nsitting apart from the others. He sat with his elbows on the table and\r\nhis face buried in his arms. He was a well-dressed young man, with\r\nbrown, curling hair.\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth wondered why he looked so miserable and why he sat alone.\r\nShe thought, perhaps, that if he weren\'t so happy as the other\r\ngentlemen, he would be more sorry for cold and hungry girls. She\r\nhesitated, then walked along and directly up to him.\r\n\r\nOne or two gentlemen laid down their papers and watched this; they\r\nsmiled and nodded to each other. The child did not see them to wonder\r\nwhy. She went up and put her hand upon the young man\'s arm.\r\n\r\nHe started. The brown, curly head lifted itself from the shelter of his\r\narms; a young face looked sharply at the beggar girl,--a beautiful young\r\nface it might have been.\r\n\r\nIt was haggard now and dreadful to look at,--bloated and badly marked\r\nwith the unmistakable marks of a wicked week\'s debauch. He roughly said:\r\n\r\n"What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m hungry," said Mary Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help that. Go away."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t had anything to eat for a whole day--a whole day!" repeated\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\nHer lip quivered. But she spoke distinctly. Her voice sounded through\r\nthe room. One gentleman after another laid down his paper or his pipe.\r\nSeveral were watching this little scene.\r\n\r\n"Go away!" repeated the young man, irritably. "Don\'t bother me. I\r\nhaven\'t had anything to eat for three days!"\r\n\r\nHis face went down into his arms again. Mary Elizabeth stood staring at\r\nthe brown, curling hair. She stood perfectly still for some moments. She\r\nevidently was greatly puzzled. She walked away a little distance, then\r\nstopped and thought it over.\r\n\r\nAnd now paper after paper and pipe after cigar went down. Every\r\ngentleman in the room began to look on. The young man with the beautiful\r\nbrown curls, and dissipated, disgraced, and hidden face was not stiller\r\nthan the rest.\r\n\r\nThe little figure in the pink calico and the red shawl and big rubbers\r\nstood for a moment silent among them all. The waiter came to take her\r\nout but the gentlemen motioned him away.\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth turned her five-cent piece over and over in her purple\r\nhand. Her hand shook. The tears came. The smell of the dinner from the\r\ndining-room grew savoury and strong. The child put the piece of money to\r\nher lips as if she could have eaten it, then turned and, without further\r\nhesitation, went back.\r\n\r\nShe touched the young man--on the bright hair this time--with her\r\ntrembling little hand.\r\n\r\nThe room was so still now that what she said rang out to the corridor,\r\nwhere the waiters stood, with the clerk behind looking over the desk to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry you are so hungry. If you haven\'t had anything for three\r\ndays, you must be hungrier than me. I\'ve got five cents. A gentleman\r\ngave it me. I wish you would take it. I\'ve only gone one day. You can\r\nget some supper with it, and--maybe--I--can get some somewheres! I wish\r\nyou\'d please to take it!"\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth stood quite still, holding out her five-cent piece. She\r\ndid not understand the stir that went all over the bright room. She did\r\nnot see that some of the gentlemen coughed and wiped their spectacles.\r\n\r\nShe did not know why the brown curls before her came up with such a\r\nstart, nor why the young man\'s wasted face flushed red and hot with a\r\nnoble shame.\r\n\r\nShe did not in the least understand why he flung the five-cent piece\r\nupon the table, and, snatching her in his arms, held her fast and hid\r\nhis face on her plaid shawl and sobbed. Nor did she seem to know what\r\ncould be the reason that nobody seemed amused to see this gentleman\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who had given her the money came up, and some more came\r\nup, and they gathered around, and she in the midst of them, and they all\r\nspoke kindly, and the young man with the bad face that might have been\r\nso beautiful stood up, still clinging to her, and said aloud:\r\n\r\n"She\'s shamed me before you all, and she\'s shamed me to myself! I\'ll\r\nlearn a lesson from this beggar, so help me God!"\r\n\r\nSo then he took the child upon his knee, and the gentlemen came up to\r\nlisten, and the young man asked her what her name was.\r\n\r\n"Mary Elizabeth, sir."\r\n\r\n"Names used to mean things--in the Bible--when I was as little as you. I\r\nread the Bible then. Does Mary Elizabeth mean angel of rebuke?"\r\n\r\n"Sir?"\r\n\r\n"Where do you live, Mary Elizabeth?"\r\n\r\n"Nowhere, sir."\r\n\r\n"Where do you sleep?"\r\n\r\n"In Mrs. O\'Flynn\'s shed, sir. It\'s too cold for the cows. She\'s so kind,\r\nshe lets us stay."\r\n\r\n"Whom do you stay with?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody, only Jo."\r\n\r\n"Is Jo your brother?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. Jo is a girl. I haven\'t got only Jo."\r\n\r\n"What does Jo do for a living?"\r\n\r\n"She--gets it, sir."\r\n\r\n"And what do you do?"\r\n\r\n"I beg. It\'s better than to--get it, sir, I think."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s your mother?"\r\n\r\n"Dead."\r\n\r\n"What did she die of?"\r\n\r\n"Drink, sir," said Mary Elizabeth, in her distinct and gentle tone.\r\n\r\n"Ah--well. And your father?"\r\n\r\n"He is dead. He died in prison."\r\n\r\n"What sent him to prison?"\r\n\r\n"Drink, sir."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"I had a brother once," continued Mary Elizabeth, who grew quite\r\neloquent with so large an audience, "but he died, too."\r\n\r\n"I do want my supper," she added, after a pause, speaking in a whisper,\r\nas if to Jo or to herself, "and Jo\'ll be wondering for me."\r\n\r\n"Wait, then," said the young man. "I\'ll see if I can\'t beg enough to get\r\nyou your supper."\r\n\r\n"I thought there must be an extry one among so many folks!" cried Mary\r\nElizabeth; for now, she thought, she should get back her five cents.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, the young man put the five cents into his hat, to begin\r\nwith. Then he took out his purse, and put in something that made less\r\nnoise than the five-cent piece and something more and more and more.\r\n\r\nThen he passed around the great room, walking still unsteadily, and the\r\ngentleman who gave the five cents and all the gentlemen put something\r\ninto the young man\'s hat.\r\n\r\nSo, when he came back to the table, he emptied the hat and counted the\r\nmoney, and, truly, it was forty dollars.\r\n\r\n"Forty dollars!"\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth looked frightened.\r\n\r\n"It\'s yours," said the young man. "Now come to supper. But see! this\r\ngentleman who gave you the five-cent piece shall take care of the money\r\nfor you. You can trust him. He\'s got a wife, too. But we\'ll come to\r\nsupper now."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo the young man took her by the hand, and the gentleman whose wife knew\r\nall about what to do with orphans took her by the other hand, and one or\r\ntwo more gentlemen followed, and they all went into the dining-room, and\r\nput Mary Elizabeth in a chair at a clean white table, and asked her\r\nwhat she wanted for her supper.\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth said that a little dry toast and a cup of milk would do\r\nnicely. So all the gentlemen laughed. And she wondered why.\r\n\r\nAnd the young man with the brown curls laughed, too, and began to look\r\nquite happy. But he ordered chicken and cranberry sauce and mashed\r\npotatoes and celery and rolls and butter and tomatoes and an ice cream\r\nand a cup of tea and nuts and raisins and cake and custard and apples\r\nand grapes.\r\n\r\nAnd Mary Elizabeth sat in her pink dress and red shawl and ate the\r\nwhole; and why it didn\'t kill her nobody knows; but it didn\'t.\r\n\r\nThe young man with the face that might have been beautiful--that might\r\nbe yet, one would have thought who had seen him then--stood watching the\r\nlittle girl.\r\n\r\n"She\'s preached me the best sermon," he said below his breath, "I ever\r\nheard. May God bless her! I wish there were a thousand like her in this\r\nselfish world!"\r\n\r\nAnd when I heard about it I wished so, too.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH STUART PHELPS WARD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Oh, there is nothing on earth half so holy\r\n    As the innocent heart of a child.\r\n\r\nDICKENS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FROST\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Frost looked forth, one still clear night,\r\n    And whispered: "Now I shall be out of sight;\r\n    So through the valley and over the height,\r\n      In silence I\'ll take my way:\r\n    I will not go on like that blustering train,\r\n    The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,\r\n    Who make so much bustle and noise in vain,\r\n      But I\'ll be as busy as they."\r\n\r\n    Then he flew to the mountain and powdered its crest;\r\n    He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed\r\n    In diamond beads--and over the breast\r\n      Of the quivering lake he spread\r\n    A coat of mail, that it need not fear\r\n    The downward point of many a spear\r\n    That he hung on its margin, far and near,\r\n      Where a rock could rear its head.\r\n\r\n    He went to the windows of those who slept,\r\n    And over each pane, like a fairy, crept;\r\n    Wherever he breathed, wherever he stept,\r\n      By the light of the moon were seen\r\n    Most beautiful things:--there were flowers and trees;\r\n    There were bevies of birds and swarms of bees:\r\n    There were cities with temples and towers; and these\r\n      All pictured in silver sheen.\r\n\r\n    But he did one thing that was hardly fair;\r\n    He peeped in the cupboard, and finding there\r\n    That all had forgotten for him to prepare--\r\n      "Now just to set them a-thinking,\r\n    I\'ll bite this basket of fruit," said he,\r\n    "This costly pitcher I\'ll burst in three,\r\n    And the glass of water they\'ve left for me\r\n      Shall \'Tchick!\' to tell them I\'m drinking."\r\n\r\nH.

The youngest brother, Gluck, was twelve years old,\r\nand kind to everyone. He had to act as cook and servant to his brothers.\r\n\r\nOne cold, wet day the brothers went out, telling Gluck to roast a leg of\r\nmutton on the spit, let nobody into the house, and let nothing out.\r\nAfter a time some one knocked at the door. Gluck went to the window,\r\nopened it, and put his head out to see who it was.\r\n\r\nIt was the most extraordinary-looking little gentleman. He had a very\r\nlarge nose, slightly brass-coloured; very round and very red cheeks;\r\nmerry eyes, long hair, and moustaches that curled twice round like a\r\ncorkscrew on each side of his mouth. He was four feet six inches high,\r\nand wore a pointed cap as long as himself. It was decorated with a black\r\nfeather about three feet long. Around his body was folded an enormous\r\nblack, glossy-looking cloak much too long for him. As he knocked again\r\nhe caught sight of Gluck.\r\n\r\n"Hollo!" said the little gentleman, "that\'s not the way to answer the\r\ndoor; I\'m wet, let me in."\r\n\r\nTo do the little gentleman justice, he _was_ wet. His feather hung down\r\nbetween his legs like a beaten puppy\'s tail, dripping like an umbrella;\r\nand from the ends of his moustaches the water was running into his\r\nwaistcoat pockets, and out again like a mill stream.\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon, sir," said Gluck, "I\'m very sorry, but I really can\'t."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t what?" said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t let you in, sir,--I can\'t, indeed; my brothers would beat me to\r\ndeath, sir, if I thought of such a thing. What do you want, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Want?" said the old gentleman, petulantly, "I want fire and shelter;\r\nand there\'s your great fire there blazing, crackling, and dancing on the\r\nwalls, with nobody to feel it. Let me in, I say; I only want to warm\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nGluck had had his head, by this time, so long out of the window that he\r\nbegan to feel it was really unpleasantly cold, and when he turned and\r\nsaw the beautiful fire rustling and roaring, and throwing long, bright\r\ntongues up the chimney, as if it were licking its chops at the savoury\r\nsmell of the leg of mutton, his heart melted within him that it should\r\nbe burning away for nothing. "He does look _very_ wet," said little\r\nGluck; "I\'ll just let him in for a quarter of an hour." Round he went to\r\nthe door, and opened it; and as the little gentleman walked in, through\r\nthe house came a gust of wind that made the old chimneys totter.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good boy," said the little gentleman. "Never mind your\r\nbrothers. I\'ll talk to them."\r\n\r\n"Pray, sir, don\'t do any such thing," said Gluck. "I can\'t let you stay\r\ntill they come; they\'d be the death of me."\r\n\r\n"Dear me," said the old gentleman, "I\'m very sorry to hear that. How\r\nlong may I stay?"\r\n\r\n"Only till the mutton\'s done, sir," replied Gluck, "and it\'s very\r\nbrown."\r\n\r\nThen the old gentleman walked into the kitchen, and sat himself down on\r\nthe hob, with the top of his cap accommodated up the chimney, for it\r\nwas a great deal too high for the roof. "You\'ll soon dry there, sir,"\r\nsaid Gluck, and sat down again to turn the mutton. But the old gentleman\r\ndid _not_ dry there, but went on drip, drip, dripping among the cinders,\r\nand the fire fizzed and sputtered, and began to look very black and\r\nuncomfortable; never was such a cloak; every fold in it ran like a\r\ngutter.\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon, sir," said Gluck at length, after watching the water\r\nspreading in long quicksilver-like streams over the floor for a quarter\r\nof an hour; "mayn\'t I take your cloak?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n"Your cap, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I am all right, thank you," said the old gentleman, rather gruffly.\r\n\r\n"But--sir--I\'m very sorry," said Gluck, hesitatingly; "but--really,\r\nsir--you\'re putting the fire out."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll take longer to do the mutton, then," replied his visitor, dryly.\r\n\r\nGluck was very much puzzled by the behaviour of his guest; it was such a\r\nstrange mixture of coolness and humility. He turned away at the string\r\nmeditatively for another five minutes.\r\n\r\n"That mutton looks very nice," said the old gentleman, at length. "Can\'t\r\nyou give me a little bit?"\r\n\r\n"Impossible, sir," said Gluck.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very hungry," continued the old gentleman; "I\'ve had nothing to eat\r\nyesterday, nor to-day. They surely couldn\'t miss a bit from the\r\nknuckle!"\r\n\r\nHe spoke in so very melancholy a tone that it quite melted Gluck\'s\r\nheart. "They promised me one slice to-day, sir," said he; "I can give\r\nyou that, but not a bit more."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good boy," said the old gentleman again.\r\n\r\nThen Gluck warmed a plate and sharpened a knife. "I don\'t care if I do\r\nget beaten for it," thought he. Just as he had cut a large slice out of\r\nthe mutton, there came a tremendous rap at the door. The old gentleman\r\njumped off the hob, as if it had suddenly become inconveniently warm.\r\nGluck fitted the slice into the mutton again, with desperate efforts at\r\nexactitude, and ran to open the door.\r\n\r\n"What did you keep us waiting in the rain for?" said Schwartz, as he\r\nwalked in, throwing his umbrella in Gluck\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Ay! what for, indeed, you little vagabond?" said Hans, administering an\r\neducational box on the ear, as he followed his brother into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Bless my soul!" said Schwartz, when he opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Amen," said the little gentleman, who had taken his cap off, and was\r\nstanding in the middle of the kitchen, bowing with the utmost possible\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that?" said Schwartz, catching up a rolling-pin, and turning to\r\nGluck with a fierce frown.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, indeed, brother," said Gluck, in great terror.\r\n\r\n"How did he get in?" roared Schwartz.\r\n\r\n"My dear brother," said Gluck, deprecatingly, "he was so _very_ wet!"\r\n\r\nThe rolling-pin was descending on Gluck\'s head; but at the instant the\r\nold gentleman interposed his conical cap, on which it crashed with a\r\nshock that shook the water out of it all over the room. What was very\r\nodd, the rolling-pin no sooner touched the cap than it flew out of\r\nSchwartz\'s hand, spinning like a straw in a high wind, and fell into the\r\ncorner at the farther end of the room.\r\n\r\n"Who are you, sir?" demanded Schwartz, turning upon him.\r\n\r\n"What\'s your business?" snarled Hans.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a poor, old man, sir," the little gentleman began very modestly,\r\n"and I saw your fire through the window, and begged shelter for a\r\nquarter of an hour."\r\n\r\n"Have the goodness to walk out again, then," said Schwartz. "We\'ve quite\r\nenough water in our kitchen, without making it a drying-house."\r\n\r\n"It is a cold day to turn an old man out in, sir; look at my gray\r\nhairs." They hung down to his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Ay!" said Hans, "there are enough of them to keep you warm. Walk!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m very, very hungry, sir; couldn\'t you spare me a bit of bread before\r\nI go?"\r\n\r\n"Bread, indeed!" said Schwartz; "do you suppose we\'ve nothing to do with\r\nour bread but to give it to such red-nosed fellows as you?"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you sell your feather?" said Hans, sneeringly. "Out with\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"A little bit," said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n"Be off!" said Schwartz.\r\n\r\n"Pray, gentlemen--"\r\n\r\n"Off, and be hanged!" cried Hans, seizing him by the collar. But he had\r\nno sooner touched the old gentleman\'s collar, than away he went after\r\nthe rolling-pin, spinning round and round, till he fell into the corner\r\non the top of it. Then Schwartz was very angry, and ran at the old\r\ngentleman to turn him out; but he also had hardly touched him, when away\r\nhe went after Hans and the rolling-pin, and hit his head against the\r\nwall as he tumbled into the corner. And so there they lay, all three.\r\n\r\nThen the old gentleman spun himself round with velocity in the opposite\r\ndirection; continued to spin until his long cloak was all wound neatly\r\nabout him; clapped his cap on his head, very much on one side (for it\r\ncould not stand upright without going through the ceiling), gave an\r\nadditional twist to his corkscrew moustaches, and replied with perfect\r\ncoolness: "Gentlemen, I wish you a very good-morning. At twelve o\'clock\r\nto-night I\'ll call again; after such a refusal of hospitality as I have\r\njust experienced, you will not be surprised if that visit is the last I\r\never pay you."\r\n\r\n"If I ever catch you here again," muttered Schwartz, coming,\r\nhalf-frightened, out of the corner--but before he could finish his\r\nsentence, the old gentleman had shut the house door behind him with a\r\ngreat bang; and past the window, at the same instant, drove a wreath of\r\nragged cloud, that whirled and rolled away down the valley in all manner\r\nof shapes; turning over and over in the air, and melting away at last in\r\na gush of rain.\r\n\r\n"A very pretty business, indeed, Mr. Gluck!" said Schwartz. "Dish the\r\nmutton, sir. If ever I catch you at such a trick again--bless me, why\r\nthe mutton\'s been cut!"\r\n\r\n"You promised me one slice, brother, you know," said Gluck.\r\n\r\n"Oh! and you were cutting it hot, I suppose, and going to catch all the\r\ngravy. It\'ll be long before I promise you such a thing again. Leave the\r\nroom, sir; and have the kindness to wait in the coal-cellar till I call\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nGluck left the room melancholy enough. The brothers ate as much mutton\r\nas they could, locked the rest in the cupboard, and proceeded to get\r\nvery drunk after dinner.\r\n\r\nSuch a night as it was! Howling wind and rushing rain, without\r\nintermission.\r\n\r\nThe brothers had just sense enough left to put up all the shutters, and\r\ndouble-bar the door, before they went to bed. They usually slept in the\r\nsame room. As the clock struck twelve, they were both awakened by a\r\ntremendous crash. Their door burst open with a violence that shook the\r\nhouse from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" cried Schwartz, starting up in his bed.\r\n\r\n"Only I," said the little gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers sat up on their bolster, and stared into the darkness.\r\nThe room was full of water, and by a misty moonbeam, which found its way\r\nthrough a hole in the shutter, they could see, in the midst of it, an\r\nenormous foam globe, spinning round, and bobbing up and down like a\r\ncork, on which, as on a most luxurious cushion, reclined the little old\r\ngentleman, cap and all. There was plenty of room for it now, for the\r\nroof was off.\r\n\r\n"Sorry to incommode you," said their visitor, ironically. "I\'m afraid\r\nyour beds are dampish; perhaps you had better go to your brother\'s room;\r\nI\'ve left the ceiling on there."\r\n\r\nThey required no second admonition, but rushed into Gluck\'s room, wet\r\nthrough, and in an agony of terror.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find my card on the kitchen table," the old gentleman called\r\nafter them. "Remember, the _last_ visit."\r\n\r\n"Pray Heaven it may be!" said Schwartz, shuddering. And the foam globe\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nDawn came at last, and the two brothers looked out of Gluck\'s little\r\nwindow in the morning. The Treasure Valley was one mass of ruin and\r\ndesolation. The inundation had swept away trees, crops, and cattle, and\r\nleft, in their stead, a waste of red sand and gray mud. The two brothers\r\ncrept, shivering and horror-struck, into the kitchen. The water had\r\ngutted the whole first floor: corn, money, almost every movable thing\r\nhad been swept away, and there was left only a small white card on the\r\nkitchen table. On it, in large, breezy, long-legged letters, were\r\nengraved the words:--\r\n\r\n     SOUTH-WEST WIND, ESQUIRE.\r\n\r\nRUSKIN: "The King of the Golden River."\r\n(Adapted)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The cloud-capp\'d towers, the gorgeous palaces,\r\n    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\r\n    Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve;\r\n    And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\r\n    Leave not a rack behind.

There was a song in every heart; and if the\r\nheart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in every\r\nface, and a spring in every step. The locust trees were in bloom, and\r\nthe fragrance of the blossoms filled the air.\r\n\r\nTom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a\r\nlong-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and the gladness went out of\r\nnature, and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards\r\nof board fence nine feet high! It seemed to him that life was hollow,\r\nand existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it\r\nalong the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared\r\nthe insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of\r\nunwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged.\r\n\r\nHe began to think of the fun he had planned for this day, and his\r\nsorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys would come tripping along on all\r\nsorts of delicious expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of\r\nhim for having to work--the very thought of it burnt him like fire.\r\n\r\nHe got out his worldly wealth and examined it--bits of toys, marbles and\r\ntrash; enough to buy an exchange of work maybe, but not enough to buy so\r\nmuch as half an hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened\r\nmeans to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys.\r\n\r\nAt this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him. Nothing\r\nless than a great, magnificent inspiration. He took up his brush and\r\nwent tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in sight presently; the very\r\nboy of all boys whose ridicule he had been dreading. Ben\'s gait was the\r\nhop, skip, and jump--proof enough that his heart was light and his\r\nanticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a long melodious\r\nwhoop at intervals, followed by a deep-toned ding dong dong, ding dong\r\ndong, for he was personating a steamboat.\r\n\r\nTom went on whitewashing--paid no attention to the steamer. Ben stared a\r\nmoment, and then said--\r\n\r\n"Hi-yi! You\'re a stump, ain\'t you!"\r\n\r\nNo answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist; then\r\nhe gave his brush another gentle sweep, and surveyed the result as\r\nbefore. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom\'s mouth watered for the\r\napple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said--\r\n\r\n"Hello, old chap; you got to work, hey?"\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s you, Ben! I warn\'t noticing."\r\n\r\n"Say, I\'m going in a-swimming, I am. Don\'t you wish you could? But of\r\ncourse you\'d druther work, wouldn\'t you? \'Course you would!"\r\n\r\nTom contemplated the boy a bit, and said--\r\n\r\n"What do you call work?"\r\n\r\n"Why ain\'t that work?"\r\n\r\nTom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly--\r\n\r\n"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain\'t. All I know is, it suits Tom\r\nSawyer."\r\n\r\n"Oh, come now, you don\'t mean to let on that you like it?"\r\n\r\nThe brush continued to move.\r\n\r\n"Like it? Well, I don\'t see why I oughtn\'t to like it. Does a boy get a\r\nchance to whitewash a fence every day?"\r\n\r\nThat put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom\r\nswept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the\r\neffect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again, Ben\r\nwatching every move, and getting more and more interested, more and more\r\nabsorbed. Presently he said--\r\n\r\n"Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little."\r\n\r\nTom considered; was about to consent; but he altered his mind: "No, no;\r\nI reckon it wouldn\'t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly\'s awful\r\nparticular about this fence--right here on the street, you know--but if\r\nit was the back fence I wouldn\'t mind, and she wouldn\'t. Yes, she\'s\r\nawful particular about this fence; it\'s got to be done very careful; I\r\nreckon there ain\'t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can\r\ndo it the way it\'s got to be done."\r\n\r\n"No--is that so? Oh, come now; lemme just try, only just a little. I\'d\r\nlet you, if you was me, Tom."\r\n\r\n"Ben, I\'d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly--well, Jim wanted to do\r\nit, but she wouldn\'t let him. Sid wanted to do it, but she wouldn\'t let\r\nSid. Now, don\'t you see how I am fixed? If you was to tackle this fence,\r\nand anything was to happen to it--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, shucks; I\'ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say--I\'ll give you\r\nthe core of my apple."\r\n\r\n"Well, here. No, Ben; now don\'t; I\'m afeard--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you all of it!"\r\n\r\nTom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his\r\nheart. And while Ben worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist\r\nsat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his\r\napple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of\r\nmaterial; boys happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but\r\nremained to whitewash.\r\n\r\nBy the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy\r\nFisher for a kite in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller\r\nbought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with; and so on, and\r\nso on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from\r\nbeing a poor, poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally\r\nrolling in wealth.\r\n\r\nHe had, besides the things I have mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a\r\njew\'s harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a\r\nspool-cannon, a key that wouldn\'t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk,\r\na glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six\r\nfire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a\r\ndog-collar--but no dog--the handle of a knife, four pieces of\r\norange-peel, and a dilapidated old window-sash. He had had a nice, good,\r\nidle time all the while--plenty of company--and the fence had three\r\ncoats of whitewash on it! If he hadn\'t run out of whitewash, he would\r\nhave bankrupted every boy in the village.\r\n\r\nTom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world after all. He\r\nhad discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it, namely,\r\nthat, in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only\r\nnecessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great\r\nand wise philosopher, he would have comprehended that Work consists of\r\nwhatever a body is _obliged_ to do, and that Play consists of whatever a\r\nbody is _not_ obliged to do.\r\n\r\nMARK TWAIN: "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\n    Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,\r\n      As his corpse to the rampart we hurried;\r\n    Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot\r\n      O\'er the grave where our hero we buried.\r\n\r\n    We buried him darkly at dead of night,\r\n      The sods with our bayonets turning;\r\n    By the struggling moon-beam\'s misty light,\r\n      And the lantern dimly burning.\r\n\r\n    No useless coffin inclosed his breast,\r\n      Nor in sheet nor in shroud we wound him;\r\n    But he lay like a warrior taking his rest,\r\n      With his martial cloak around him.\r\n\r\n    Few and short were the prayers we said,\r\n      And we spoke not a word of sorrow;\r\n    But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead,\r\n      And we bitterly thought of the morrow.\r\n\r\n    We thought as we hollowed his narrow bed,\r\n      And smoothed down his lonely pillow,\r\n    That the foe and the stranger would tread o\'er his head,\r\n      And we far away on the billow.\r\n\r\n    Lightly they\'ll talk of the spirit that\'s gone,\r\n      And o\'er his cold ashes upbraid him,--\r\n    But little he\'ll reck, if they let him sleep on,\r\n      In the grave where a Briton has laid him.\r\n\r\n    But half of our heavy task was done\r\n      When the clock struck the hour for retiring;\r\n    And we heard the distant and random gun\r\n      That the foe was sullenly firing.\r\n\r\n    Slowly and sadly we laid him down\r\n      From the field of his fame fresh and gory;\r\n    We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone,\r\n      But we left him alone with his glory.\r\n\r\nC. WOLFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHISTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy of seven years old, my friends, on a holiday, filled my\r\npocket with coppers. I went directly to a shop where they sold toys for\r\nchildren, and being charmed with the sound of a whistle, that I met by\r\nthe way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered and gave all\r\nmy money for one. I then came home, and went whistling all over the\r\nhouse, much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing all the family. My\r\nbrothers, and sisters, and cousins, understanding the bargain I had\r\nmade, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth; put\r\nme in mind what good things I might have bought with the rest of the\r\nmoney; and laughed at me so much for my folly, that I cried with\r\nvexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave\r\nme pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was afterwards of use to me, the impression continuing in\r\nmy mind; so that often, when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary\r\nthing, I said to myself: "Don\'t give too much for the whistle;" and I\r\nsaved my money.\r\n\r\nAs I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, I\r\nthought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for the whistle.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw any one fond of popularity, constantly employing himself in\r\npolitics, neglecting his own affairs and ruining them by that neglect,\r\n"He pays, indeed," said I, "too much for his whistle."\r\n\r\nIf I saw one fond of fine clothes, fine furniture, fine horses, all\r\nabove his fortune, for which he contracted debts and ended his career in\r\npoverty, "Alas!" said I, "he has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle."\r\n\r\nIn short, I believed that a great part of the miseries of mankind were\r\nbrought upon them by the false estimates they had made of the value of\r\nthings, and by their giving too much for their whistles.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CANADIAN BOAT SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n    Faintly as tolls the evening chime\r\n    Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time.\r\n    Soon as the woods on shore look dim,\r\n    We\'ll sing at St. Ann\'s our parting hymn.\r\n    Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast,\r\n    The Rapids are near and the daylight\'s past.\r\n\r\n      Why should we yet our sail unfurl?\r\n    There is not a breath the blue wave to curl;\r\n    But, when the wind blows off the shore,\r\n    Oh! sweetly we\'ll rest our weary oar.\r\n    Blow, breezes, blow, the stream runs fast,\r\n    The Rapids are near and the daylight\'s past.\r\n\r\n      Utawas\' tide! this trembling moon\r\n    Shall see us float over thy surges soon.\r\n    Saint of this green isle! hear our prayers,\r\n    Oh, grant us cool heavens and favouring airs.\r\n    Blow, breezes, blow, the stream runs fast,\r\n    The Rapids are near and the daylight\'s past.\r\n\r\nMOORE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM\r\n\r\n\r\nAt an early period in the history of Holland, a boy was born in Haarlem,\r\na town remarkable for its variety of fortune in war, but happily still\r\nmore so for its manufactures and inventions in peace.\r\n\r\nHis father was a sluicer--that is, one whose employment it was to open\r\nand shut the sluices or large oak gates which, placed at certain regular\r\ndistances, close the entrances of the canals, and secure Holland from\r\nthe danger to which it seems exposed, of finding itself under water,\r\nrather than above it. When water is wanted, the sluicer raises the\r\nsluices more or less, as required, as the cook turns the cock of a\r\nfountain, and closes them again carefully at night; otherwise the water\r\nwould flow into the canals, then overflow them, and inundate the whole\r\ncountry; so that even the little children in Holland are fully aware of\r\nthe importance of a punctual discharge of the sluicer\'s duties.\r\n\r\nThe boy was about eight years old when, one day, he asked permission to\r\ntake some cakes to a poor blind man, who lived at the other side of the\r\ndike. His father gave him leave, but charged him not to stay too late.\r\nThe child promised, and set off on his little journey. The blind man\r\nthankfully partook of his young friend\'s cakes, and the boy, mindful of\r\nhis father\'s orders, did not wait, as usual, to hear one of the old\r\nman\'s stories, but as soon as he had seen him eat one muffin, took leave\r\nof him to return home.\r\n\r\nAs he went along by the canals, then quite full, for it was in October,\r\nand the autumn rains had swelled the waters,--the boy now stooped to\r\npull the little blue flowers which his mother loved so well, now, in\r\nchildish gaiety, hummed some merry song. The road gradually became more\r\nsolitary, and soon neither the joyous shout of the villager returning to\r\nhis cottage home, nor the rough voice of the carter grumbling at his\r\nlazy horses, was any longer to be heard. The little fellow now perceived\r\nthat the blue of the flowers in his hands was scarcely distinguishable\r\nfrom the green of the surrounding herbage, and he looked up in some\r\ndismay. The night was falling; not, however, a dark, winter night, but\r\none of those beautiful, clear, moonlight nights, in which every object\r\nis perceptible, though not as distinctly as by day.\r\n\r\nThe child thought of his father, of his injunction, and was preparing to\r\nquit the ravine in which he was almost buried, and to regain the beach,\r\nwhen suddenly a slight noise, like the trickling of water upon pebbles,\r\nattracted his attention. He was near one of the large sluices, and he\r\nnow carefully examined it, and soon discovered a hole in the wood,\r\nthrough which the water was flowing. With the instant perception which\r\nevery child in Holland would have, the boy saw that the water must soon\r\nenlarge the hole through which it was now only dropping, and that utter\r\nand general ruin would be the consequence of the inundation of the\r\ncountry that must follow. To see, to throw away the flowers, to climb\r\nfrom stone to stone till he reached the hole, and to put his finger into\r\nit, was the work of a moment, and to his delight he found that he had\r\nsucceeded in stopping the flow of the water.\r\n\r\nThis was all very well for a little while, and the child thought only of\r\nthe success of his device. But the night was closing in, and with the\r\nnight came the cold. The little boy looked around in vain. No one came.\r\nHe shouted--he called loudly--no one answered. He resolved to stay there\r\nall night, but alas! the cold was becoming every moment more biting, and\r\nthe poor finger fixed in the hole began to feel benumbed, and the\r\nnumbness soon extended to the hand, and thence throughout the whole arm.\r\nThe pain became still greater, still harder to bear, but yet the boy\r\nmoved not. Tears rolled down his cheeks as he thought of his father, of\r\nhis mother, of his little bed, where he might now be sleeping so\r\nsoundly; but still the little fellow stirred not, for he knew that did\r\nhe remove the small slender finger which he had opposed to the escape of\r\nthe water, not only would he himself be drowned, but his father, his\r\nbrothers, his neighbours--nay, the whole village.\r\n\r\nWe know not what faltering of purpose, what momentary failures of\r\ncourage there might have been during that long and terrible night; but\r\ncertain it is, that at daybreak he was found in the same painful\r\nposition by a clergyman returning from attendance on a deathbed, who, as\r\nhe advanced, thought he heard groans, and bending over the dike,\r\ndiscovered a child seated on a stone, writhing from pain, and with pale\r\nface and tearful eyes.\r\n\r\n"In the name of wonder, boy," he exclaimed, "what are you doing there?"\r\n\r\n"I am hindering the water from running out," was the answer, in perfect\r\nsimplicity, of the child, who, during that whole night, had been\r\nevincing such heroic fortitude and undaunted courage.\r\n\r\nThe Muse of History has handed down to posterity many a warrior, the\r\ndestroyer of thousands of his fellow-men--but she has left us in\r\nignorance of the name of this real little hero of Haarlem.\r\n\r\nSHARPE\'S LONDON MAGAZINE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dreams, books, are each a world; and books, we know,\r\n    Are a substantial world, both pure and good.\r\n\r\nWORDSWORTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFATHER WILLIAM\r\n\r\n\r\n"Repeat \'You are old, Father William,\'" said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nAlice folded her hands, and began:--\r\n\r\n    "You are old, Father William," the young man said,\r\n      "And your hair has become very white;\r\n    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--\r\n      Do you think, at your age, it is right?"\r\n\r\n    "In my youth," Father William replied to his son,\r\n      "I feared it might injure the brain;\r\n    But now that I\'m perfectly sure I have none,\r\n      Why, I do it again and again."\r\n\r\n    "You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,\r\n      And have grown most uncommonly fat;\r\n    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--\r\n      Pray, what is the reason of that?"\r\n\r\n    "In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his gray locks,\r\n      "I kept all my limbs very supple\r\n    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--\r\n      Allow me to sell you a couple."\r\n\r\n    "You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak\r\n      For anything tougher than suet;\r\n    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak.\r\n      Pray, how did you manage to do it?"\r\n\r\n    "In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law,\r\n      And argued each case with my wife;\r\n    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\r\n      Has lasted the rest of my life."\r\n\r\n    "You are old," said the youth; "one would hardly suppose\r\n      That your eye was as steady as ever;\r\n    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--\r\n      What made you so awfully clever?"\r\n\r\n    "I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"\r\n      Said his father; "don\'t give yourself airs!\r\n    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\r\n      Be off, or I\'ll kick you down-stairs!"\r\n\r\n"That is not said right," said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n"Not _quite_ right, I\'m afraid," said Alice timidly; "some of the words\r\nhave got altered."\r\n\r\n"It is wrong from beginning to end," said the Caterpillar decidedly, and\r\nthere was silence for some minutes.\r\n\r\nLEWIS CARROLL: "The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID AND GOLIATH\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and Saul\r\nand the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley\r\nof Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. And the\r\nPhilistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a\r\nmountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.\r\n\r\nAnd there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named\r\nGoliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. And he had an\r\nhelmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and\r\nthe weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass. And he had\r\ngreaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his\r\nshoulders. And the staff of his spear was like a weaver\'s beam; and his\r\nspear\'s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a\r\nshield went before him.\r\n\r\nAnd he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them,\r\nWhy are ye come out to set your battle in array? Am not I a Philistine,\r\nand ye servants to Saul? Choose you a man for you, and let him come down\r\nto me. If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be\r\nyour servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye\r\nbe our servants, and serve us. And the Philistine said, I defy the\r\narmies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.\r\nWhen Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were\r\ndismayed, and greatly afraid.\r\n\r\nAnd David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a\r\nkeeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to\r\nthe trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for\r\nthe battle. For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array,\r\narmy against army. And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper\r\nof the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his\r\nbrethren. And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the\r\nchampion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of\r\nthe Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard\r\nthem. And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,\r\nand were sore afraid. And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man\r\nthat is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be,\r\nthat the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great\r\nriches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father\'s house free\r\nin Israel. And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What\r\nshall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away\r\nthe reproach from Israel? For who is this Philistine, that he should\r\ndefy the armies of the living God? And the people answered him after\r\nthis manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.\r\nAnd when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them\r\nbefore Saul: and he sent for him.\r\n\r\nAnd David said to Saul, Let no man\'s heart fail because of him; thy\r\nservant will go and fight with this Philistine. And Saul said to David,\r\nThou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for\r\nthou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. And David said\r\nunto Saul, Thy servant kept his father\'s sheep, and there came a lion,\r\nand a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: And I went out after him,\r\nand smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose\r\nagainst me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. Thy\r\nservant slew both the lion and the bear: and this Philistine shall be as\r\none of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. David\r\nsaid moreover, The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion,\r\nand out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of\r\nthis Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the Lord be with\r\nthee.\r\n\r\nAnd Saul armed David with his armour, and he put a helmet of brass upon\r\nhis head; also he armed him with a coat of mail. And David girded his\r\nsword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it.\r\nAnd David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved\r\nthem. And David put them off him. And he took his staff in his hand, and\r\nchose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a\r\nshepherd\'s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his\r\nhand: and he drew near to the Philistine.\r\n\r\nAnd the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that\r\nbare the shield went before him. And when the Philistine looked about,\r\nand saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and\r\nof a fair countenance. And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog,\r\nthat thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by\r\nhis gods.\r\n\r\nAnd the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh\r\nunto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.\r\n\r\nThen said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and\r\nwith a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the\r\nLord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.\r\nThis day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite\r\nthee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the\r\nhost of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the\r\nwild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a\r\nGod in Israel. And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not\r\nwith sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord\'s, and he will give you\r\ninto our hands.\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh\r\nto meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the\r\nPhilistine. And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone,\r\nand slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone\r\nsunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth. So David\r\nprevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote\r\nthe Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of\r\nDavid. Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his\r\nsword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off\r\nhis head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was\r\ndead, they fled.\r\n\r\nI.

Maggie had thrown her bonnet off very carelessly, and, coming in\r\nwith her hair rough as well as out of curl, rushed at once to Lucy. The\r\ncontrast between the two cousins was like the contrast between a rough,\r\ndark, overgrown puppy and a white kitten. Lucy put up the neatest little\r\nrosebud mouth to be kissed: everything about her was neat.\r\n\r\n"Heyday!" said Aunt Glegg, with loud emphasis. "Do little boys and girls\r\ncome into a room without taking notice of their uncles and aunts? That\r\nwasn\'t the way when I was a little girl."\r\n\r\n"Go and speak to your aunts and uncles, my dears," said Mrs. Tulliver.\r\nShe wanted to whisper to Maggie a command to go and have her hair\r\nbrushed.\r\n\r\n"Well, and how do you do? And I hope you\'re good children, are you?"\r\nsaid Aunt Glegg, in the same loud, emphatic way. "Look up, Tom, look up.\r\nLook at me now. Put your hair behind your ears, Maggie, and keep your\r\nfrock on your shoulder."\r\n\r\nAunt Glegg always spoke to them in this loud, emphatic way, as if she\r\nconsidered them deaf.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dears," said Aunt Pullet, "you grow wonderfully fast,--I doubt\r\nthey\'ll outgrow their strength. I think the girl has too much hair. I\'d\r\nhave it thinned and cut shorter, sister, if I were you; it isn\'t good\r\nfor her health. It\'s that makes her skin so brown,--don\'t you think so,\r\nsister Deane?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say, I\'m sure, sister," said Mrs. Deane, shutting her lips\r\nclose and looking at Maggie.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Mr. Tulliver, "the child\'s healthy enough: there\'s\r\nnothing ails her. There\'s red wheat as well as white, for that matter,\r\nand some like the dark grain best. But it would be as well if Bessie\r\nwould have the child\'s hair cut so it would lie smooth."\r\n\r\n"Maggie," said Mrs. Tulliver, beckoning Maggie to her, and whispering in\r\nher ear, "go and get your hair brushed,--do, for shame! I told you not\r\nto come in without going to Martha first; you know I did."\r\n\r\n"Tom, come out with me," whispered Maggie, pulling his sleeve as she\r\npassed him; and Tom followed willingly enough.\r\n\r\n"Come upstairs with me, Tom," she whispered, when they were outside the\r\ndoor. "There\'s something I want to do before dinner."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no time to play at anything before dinner," said Tom.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, there is time for this--_do_ come, Tom."\r\n\r\nTom followed Maggie upstairs into her mother\'s room, and saw her go at\r\nonce to a drawer from which she took out a large pair of scissors.\r\n\r\n"What are they for, Maggie?" said Tom, feeling his curiosity awakened.\r\n\r\nMaggie answered by seizing her front locks and cutting them straight\r\nacross the middle of her forehead.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my buttons, Maggie, you\'ll catch it!" exclaimed Tom; "you\'d better\r\nnot cut any more off."\r\n\r\nSnip! went the great scissors again while Tom was speaking; and he could\r\nhardly help feeling it was rather good fun--Maggie looking so queer.\r\n\r\n"Here, Tom, cut it behind for me," said Maggie, excited by her own\r\ndaring, and anxious to finish the deed.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll catch it, you know," said Tom, hesitating a little as he took\r\nthe scissors.\r\n\r\n"Never mind--make haste!" said Maggie, giving a little stamp with her\r\nfoot. Her cheeks were quite flushed.\r\n\r\nThe black locks were so thick,--nothing could be more tempting to a lad\r\nwho had already tasted the forbidden pleasure of cutting the pony\'s\r\nmane. One delicious grinding snip, and then another and another, and the\r\nhinder locks fell heavily on the floor. Maggie stood cropped in a\r\njagged, uneven manner, but with a sense of clearness and freedom, as if\r\nshe had emerged from a wood into the open plain.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Maggie," said Tom, jumping round her and slapping his knees as he\r\nlaughed; "oh, my buttons, what a queer thing you look! Look at yourself\r\nin the glass."\r\n\r\nMaggie felt an unexpected pang. She had thought beforehand chiefly of\r\nher own deliverance from her teasing hair and teasing remarks about it,\r\nand something also of the triumph she should have over her mother and\r\nher aunts by this very decided course of action. She didn\'t want her\r\nhair to look pretty--that was out of the question--she only wanted\r\npeople to think her a clever little girl and not to find fault with her.\r\nBut now, when Tom began to laugh at her, the affair had quite a new\r\naspect. She looked in the glass, and still Tom laughed and clapped his\r\nhands, and Maggie\'s flushed cheeks began to pale, and her lips to\r\ntremble a little.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Maggie, you\'ll have to go down to dinner directly," said Tom. "Oh,\r\nmy!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t laugh at me, Tom," said Maggie, in a passionate tone, and with an\r\noutburst of angry tears, stamping, and giving him a push.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, spitfire!" said Tom. "What did you cut it off for, then? I\r\nshall go down: I can smell the dinner going in."\r\n\r\nTom hurried down-stairs and left poor Maggie. As she stood crying before\r\nthe glass, she felt it impossible that she should go down to dinner and\r\nendure the severe eyes and severe words of her aunts, while Tom, and\r\nLucy, and Martha, who waited at table, and perhaps her father and her\r\nuncles, would laugh at her. If Tom had laughed at her, of course every\r\none else would; and, if she had only let her hair alone, she could have\r\nsat with Tom and Lucy, and had the apricot pudding and the custard! What\r\ncould she do but sob?\r\n\r\n"Miss Maggie, you\'re to come down this minute," said Kezia, entering the\r\nroom hurriedly. "What have you been a-doing? I never saw such a fright!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Kezia," said Maggie, angrily. "Go away!"\r\n\r\n"But I tell you, you\'re to come down, Miss, this minute: your mother\r\nsays so," said Kezia, going up to Maggie and taking her by the hand to\r\nraise her from the floor.\r\n\r\n"Get away, Kezia; I don\'t want any dinner," said Maggie, resisting\r\nKezia\'s arm. "I shan\'t come."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, I can\'t stay. I\'ve got to wait at dinner," said Kezia, going\r\nout again.\r\n\r\n"Maggie, you little silly," said Tom, peeping into the room ten minutes\r\nafter, "why don\'t you come and have your dinner? There\'s lots o\'\r\ngoodies, and mother says you\'re to come. What are you crying for?"\r\n\r\nOh, it was dreadful! Tom was so hard and unconcerned; if _he_ had been\r\ncrying on the floor, Maggie would have cried, too. And there was the\r\ndinner, so nice; and she was _so_ hungry. It was very bitter.\r\n\r\nBut Tom was not altogether hard. He went and put his head near her, and\r\nsaid, in a lower, comforting tone: "Won\'t you come, then, Maggie? Shall\r\nI bring you a bit of pudding when I\'ve had mine--and a custard and\r\nthings?"\r\n\r\n"Ye-e-es," said Maggie, beginning to feel life a little more tolerable.\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Tom, going away. But he turned again at the door and\r\nsaid: "But you\'d better come, you know. There\'s the dessert, you know."\r\n\r\nMaggie\'s tears had ceased, and she looked reflective as Tom left her.\r\nHis good nature had taken off the keenest edge of her suffering.\r\n\r\nSlowly she rose from among her scattered locks, and slowly she made her\r\nway down-stairs. Then she stood leaning with one shoulder against the\r\nframe of the dining-parlour door, peeping in when it was ajar. She saw\r\nTom and Lucy with an empty chair between them, and there were the\r\ncustards on a side-table--it was too much. She slipped in and went\r\ntowards the empty chair. But she had no sooner sat down than she\r\nrepented, and wished herself back again.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tulliver gave a little scream as she saw her, and dropped the large\r\ngravy-spoon into the dish with the most serious results to the\r\ntablecloth.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tulliver\'s scream made all eyes turn towards the same point as her\r\nown, and Maggie\'s cheeks and ears began to burn, while Uncle Glegg, a\r\nkind-looking, white-haired old gentleman, said: "Heyday! what little\r\ngirl\'s this? Why, I don\'t know her. Is it some little girl you\'ve picked\r\nup in the road, Kezia?"\r\n\r\n"Why, she\'s gone and cut her hair herself," said Mr. Tulliver in an\r\nundertone to Mr. Deane, laughing with much enjoyment.\r\n\r\n"Why, little Miss, you\'ve made yourself look very funny," said Uncle\r\nPullet.\r\n\r\n"Fie, for shame!" said Aunt Glegg, in her severest tone of reproof.\r\n"Little girls that cut their own hair should be whipped and fed on bread\r\nand water, not come and sit down with their aunts and uncles."\r\n\r\n"Aye, aye," said Uncle Glegg, meaning to give a playful turn, "she must\r\nbe sent to jail, I think, and they\'ll cut the rest of her hair off\r\nthere, and make it all even."\r\n\r\n"She\'s more like a gypsy than ever," said Aunt Pullet in a pitying tone.\r\n\r\n"She\'s a naughty child, that\'ll break her mother\'s heart," said Mrs.\r\nTulliver, with the tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\nMaggie seemed to be listening to a chorus of reproach and derision. Her\r\nfirst flush came from anger. Tom thought she was braving it out,\r\nsupported by the recent appearance of the pudding and custard.\r\n\r\nHe whispered: "Oh, my! Maggie, I told you you\'d catch it." He meant to\r\nbe friendly, but Maggie felt convinced that Tom was rejoicing in her\r\nignominy.\r\n\r\nHer feeble power of defiance left her in an instant, her heart swelled,\r\nand, getting up from her chair, she ran to her father, hid her face on\r\nhis shoulder, and burst out into loud sobbing. "Come, come," said her\r\nfather, soothingly, putting his arm round her, "never mind; give over\r\ncrying: father\'ll take your part."\r\n\r\nDelicious words of tenderness! Maggie never forgot any of these moments\r\nwhen her father "took her part"; she kept them in her heart, and thought\r\nof them long years after, when every one else said that her father had\r\ndone very ill by his children.\r\n\r\nGEORGE ELIOT: "The Mill on the Floss."\r\n(Adapted)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORN SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n    Heap high the farmer\'s wintry hoard!\r\n      Heap high the golden corn!\r\n    No richer gift has Autumn poured\r\n      From out her lavish horn!\r\n\r\n    Let other lands, exulting, glean\r\n      The apple from the pine,\r\n    The orange from its glossy green,\r\n      The cluster from the vine;\r\n\r\n    We better love the hardy gift\r\n      Our rugged vales bestow,\r\n    To cheer us when the storm shall drift\r\n      Our harvest-fields with snow.\r\n\r\n    Through vales of grass and meads of flowers,\r\n      Our ploughs their furrows made,\r\n    While on the hills the sun and showers\r\n      Of changeful April played.\r\n\r\n    We dropped the seed o\'er hill and plain,\r\n      Beneath the sun of May,\r\n    And frightened from our sprouting grain\r\n      The robber crows away.\r\n\r\n    All through the long, bright days of June\r\n      Its leaves grew green and fair,\r\n    And waved in hot midsummer\'s noon\r\n      Its soft and yellow hair.\r\n\r\n    And now, with autumn\'s moon-lit eves,\r\n      Its harvest-time has come,\r\n    We pluck away the frosted leaves,\r\n      And bear the treasure home.\r\n\r\n    There, richer than the fabled gift\r\n      Apollo showered of old,\r\n    Fair hands the broken grain shall sift,\r\n      And knead its meal of gold.\r\n\r\n    Let vapid idlers loll in silk\r\n      Around their costly board;\r\n    Give us the bowl of samp and milk,\r\n      By homespun beauty poured!\r\n\r\n    Where\'er the wide old kitchen hearth\r\n      Sends up its smoky curls,\r\n    Who will not thank the kindly earth,\r\n      And bless our farmer girls!\r\n\r\nWHITTIER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPORTS IN NORMAN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter dinner all the youth of the city go into the field of the suburbs,\r\nand address themselves to the famous game of football. The scholars of\r\neach school have their peculiar ball; and the particular trades have,\r\nmost of them, theirs. The elders of the city, the fathers of the\r\nparties, and the rich and wealthy, come to the field on horseback, in\r\norder to behold the exercises of the youth, and in appearance are\r\nthemselves as youthful as the youngest; seeming to be revived at the\r\nsight of so much agility, and in a participation of the diversion of\r\ntheir festive sons.\r\n\r\nAt Easter the diversion is prosecuted on the water; a target is strongly\r\nfastened to a trunk or mast fixed in the middle of the river, and a\r\nyoungster standing upright in the stern of a boat, made to move as fast\r\nas the oars and current can carry it, is to strike the target with his\r\nlance; and if, in hitting it, he breaks his lance and keeps his place in\r\nthe boat, he gains his point and triumphs; but if it happens the lance\r\nis not shivered by the force of the blow, he is, of course, tumbled into\r\nthe water, and away goes his vessel without him.\r\n\r\nHowever, a couple of boats full of young men are placed one on each side\r\nof the target, so as to be ready to take up the unsuccessful adventurer\r\nthe moment he emerges from the stream and comes fairly to the surface.\r\nThe bridge and the balconies on the banks are filled with spectators,\r\nwhose business is to laugh. On holidays, in summer, the pastime of the\r\nyouth is to exercise themselves in archery, in running, leaping,\r\nwrestling, casting of stones, and flinging to certain distances, and,\r\nlastly, with bucklers.\r\n\r\nIn the winter holidays when that vast lake which waters the walls of the\r\nCity towards the north is hard frozen, the youth, in great numbers, go\r\nto divert themselves on the ice. Some, taking a small run, place their\r\nfeet at the proper distance, and are carried, sliding sideways, a great\r\nway; others will make a large cake of ice, and seating one of their\r\ncompanions upon it, they take hold of one another\'s hands, and draw him\r\nalong: when it sometimes happens that, moving so swiftly on so slippery\r\na plain, they all fall down headlong.\r\n\r\nOthers there are who are still more expert in these amusements on the\r\nice; they place certain bones, the leg bones of some animal, under the\r\nsoles of their feet by tying them round their ankles, and, then, taking\r\na pole shod with iron into their hands, they push themselves forward by\r\nstriking it against the ice, and are carried along with a velocity equal\r\nto the flight of a bird, or a bolt discharged from a cross-bow.\r\nSometimes two of them thus furnished agree to start opposite one to\r\nanother, at a great distance; they meet, elevate their poles, attack and\r\nstrike each other, when one or both of them fall, and not without some\r\nbodily hurt; and even after their fall they shall be carried a good\r\ndistance from each other by the rapidity of the motion. Very often the\r\nleg or the arm of the party that falls, if he chances to light upon\r\nthem, is broken; but youth is an age ambitious of glory, fond and\r\ncovetous of victory, and that in future time it may acquit itself boldly\r\nand valiantly in real engagements, it will run these hazards in sham\r\nones.\r\n\r\nHawking and hunting were sports only for persons of quality, and woe be\r\nto the unhappy man of the lower orders who indulged in either of these\r\nsports. If caught he would be severely punished and might have his eyes\r\nput out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE HIGHLANDS OF ONTARIO]\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, knights with their ladies ride out, each bearing upon\r\nhis wrist a falcon with scarlet hood and collar of gold. As they near\r\nthe river a heron, who had been fishing for his breakfast among the\r\nreeds near the bank, hears them and spreading his wings flies upward. A\r\nknight slips the hood from the falcon\'s head and next instant he sees\r\nthe heron. Away he darts, while knights and ladies rein in their horses\r\nand watch. Up, and up, he goes until he passes the heron and still he\r\nflies higher. Next instant he turns and, with a terrible swoop\r\ndownwards, pounces upon the heron and kills it.\r\n\r\nThe knight sounds his whistle and instantly the falcon turns and darts\r\nback to him for the dainty food which is given as a reward for his good\r\nhunting. Then he is chained and hooded again till another bird rises. So\r\nthe morning passes, and many a bird do the falcons bring down before the\r\nknights and ladies return to the castle for "noon-meat."\r\n\r\nWILLIAM FITZSTEPHEN\r\n(Adapted)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    And He that doth the ravens feed,\r\n    Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,\r\n    Be comfort to my age!\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SONG OF CANADA\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sing me a song of the great Dominion!\r\n      Soul-felt words for a patriot\'s ear!\r\n    Ring out boldly the well-turned measure,\r\n      Voicing your notes that the world may hear;\r\n    Here is no starveling--Heaven-forsaken--\r\n      Shrinking aside where the Nations throng;\r\n    Proud as the proudest moves she among them--\r\n      Worthy is she of a noble song!\r\n\r\n    Sing me the might of her giant mountains,\r\n      Baring their brows in the dazzling blue;\r\n    Changeless alone, where all else changes,\r\n      Emblems of all that is grand and true:\r\n    Free, as the eagles around them soaring;\r\n      Fair, as they rose from their Maker\'s hand:\r\n    Shout, till the snow-caps catch the chorus--\r\n      The white-topp\'d peaks of our mountain land.\r\n\r\n    Sing me the calm of her tranquil forests,\r\n      Silence eternal, and peace profound,\r\n    In whose great heart\'s deep recesses\r\n      Breaks no tempest, and comes no sound;\r\n    Face to face with the deathlike stillness,\r\n      Here, if at all, man\'s soul might quail:\r\n    Nay! \'tis the love of that great peace leads us\r\n      Thither, where solace will never fail!\r\n\r\n    Sing me the pride of her stately rivers,\r\n      Cleaving their way to the far-off sea;\r\n    Glory of strength in their deep-mouth\'d music--\r\n      Glory of mirth in their tameless glee.\r\n    Hark! \'tis the roar of the tumbling rapids;\r\n      Deep unto deep through the dead night calls;\r\n    Truly, I hear but the voice of Freedom\r\n      Shouting her name from her fortress walls!\r\n\r\n    Sing me the joy of her fertile prairies,\r\n      League upon league of the golden grain:\r\n    Comfort, housed in the smiling homestead--\r\n      Plenty, throned on the lumbering wain.\r\n    Land of Contentment!

"Very\r\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice; "only, as it\'s asleep,\r\nI suppose it doesn\'t mind."\r\n\r\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\r\none corner of it: "No room! No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice\r\ncoming. "There\'s _plenty_ of room!" said Alice, indignantly, and she sat\r\ndown in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\r\n\r\n"Your hair wants cutting," said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice\r\nfor some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\r\n\r\n"You should learn not to make personal remarks," Alice said with some\r\nseverity: "it\'s very rude."\r\n\r\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\r\nwas: "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"\r\n\r\n"Come, we shall have some fun now!" thought Alice. "I\'m glad they\'ve\r\nbegun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that," she added aloud.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?" said the\r\nMarch Hare.\r\n\r\n"Exactly so," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Then you should say what you mean," the March Hare went on.\r\n\r\n"I do," Alice hastily replied; "at least--at least I mean what I\r\nsay--that\'s the same thing, you know."\r\n\r\n"Not the same thing a bit!" said the Hatter. "Why, you might just as\r\nwell say that \'I see what I eat\' is the same thing as \'I eat what I\r\nsee\'!"\r\n\r\n"You might just as well say," added the March Hare, "that \'I like what I\r\nget\' is the same thing as \'I get what I like\'!"\r\n\r\n"You might just as well say," added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\r\ntalking in its sleep, "that \'I breathe when I sleep\' is the same thing\r\nas \'I sleep when I breathe\'!"\r\n\r\n"It _is_ the same thing with you," said the Hatter, and here the\r\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice\r\nthought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,\r\nwhich wasn\'t much.\r\n\r\n"Have you guessed the riddle yet?" the Hatter said, turning to Alice\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"No, I give it up," Alice replied: "what\'s the answer?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the slightest idea," said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n"Nor I," said the March Hare.\r\n\r\nAlice sighed wearily. "I think you might do something better with the\r\ntime," she said, "than wasting it in asking riddles that have no\r\nanswers."\r\n\r\n"Suppose we change the subject," the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\r\n"I\'m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I don\'t know one," said Alice, rather alarmed at the\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n"Then the Dormouse shall!" they both cried.\r\n\r\n"Wake up, Dormouse!" And they pinched it on both sides at once.\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse slowly opened its eyes. "I wasn\'t asleep," it said in a\r\nhoarse, feeble voice, "I heard every word you fellows were saying."\r\n\r\n"Tell us a story!" said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n"Yes, please do!" pleaded Alice.\r\n\r\n"And be quick about it," added the Hatter, "or you\'ll be asleep again\r\nbefore it\'s done."\r\n\r\n"Once upon a time there were three little sisters," the Dormouse began\r\nin a great hurry, "and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\r\nthey lived at the bottom of a well--"\r\n\r\n"What did they live on?" said Alice, who always took a great interest in\r\nquestions of eating and drinking.\r\n\r\n"They lived on treacle," said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n"They couldn\'t have done that, you know," Alice gently remarked: "they\'d\r\nhave been ill."\r\n\r\n"So they were," said the Dormouse, "_very_ ill."\r\n\r\nAlice tried a little to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way\r\nof living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on:\r\n"But why did they live at the bottom of a well?"\r\n\r\n"Take some more tea," the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can\'t\r\ntake more."\r\n\r\n"You mean you can\'t take _less_," said the Hatter: "It\'s very easy to\r\ntake _more_ than nothing."\r\n\r\n"Nobody asked _your_ opinion," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s making personal remarks now?" the Hatter asked triumphantly.\r\n\r\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\r\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\r\nrepeated her question. "Why did they live at the bottom of a well?"\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\r\nsaid: "It was a treacle-well."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no such thing!" Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\r\nHatter and the March Hare went "Sh! Sh!" and the Dormouse sulkily\r\nremarked: "If you can\'t be civil, you\'d better finish the story for\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"No, please go on!" Alice said, very humbly, "I won\'t interrupt you\r\nagain. I dare say there may be _one_."\r\n\r\n"One, indeed!" said the Dormouse, indignantly. However it consented to\r\ngo on. "And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,\r\nyou know--"\r\n\r\n"What did they draw?" said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\r\n\r\n"Treacle," said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\r\n\r\n"I want a clean cup," interrupted the Hatter, "let\'s all move one place\r\non."\r\n\r\nHe moved as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\r\nmoved into the Dormouse\'s place, and Alice, rather unwillingly, took the\r\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\r\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\r\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate.\r\n\r\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\r\ncautiously: "But I don\'t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\r\nfrom?"\r\n\r\n"You can draw water out of a water-well," said the Hatter; "so I should\r\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh stupid?"\r\n\r\n"But they were _in_ the well," Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\r\nto notice this last remark.\r\n\r\n"Of course they were," said the Dormouse,--"well in."\r\n\r\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\r\nsome time without interrupting it.\r\n\r\n"They were learning to draw," the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\r\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; "and they drew all manner of\r\nthings--everything that begins with an M--"\r\n\r\n"Why with an M?" said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" said the March Hare.\r\n\r\nAlice was silent.\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\r\ndoze, but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\r\nlittle shriek, and went on, "--that begins with an M, such as\r\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say\r\nthings are \'much of a muchness\'--did you ever see such a thing as a\r\ndrawing of a muchness?"\r\n\r\n"Really, now you ask me," said Alice, very much confused, "I don\'t\r\nthink--"\r\n\r\n"Then you shouldn\'t talk," said the Hatter.\r\n\r\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\r\ngreat disgust, and walked off: the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\r\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\r\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\r\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\r\nthe teapot.\r\n\r\nLEWIS CARROLL: "The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE\'S DREAM\r\n\r\n\r\n    Beside the ungathered rice he lay,\r\n      His sickle in his hand;\r\n    His breast was bare, his matted hair\r\n      Was buried in the sand.\r\n    Again, in the mist and shadow of sleep,\r\n      He saw his Native Land.\r\n\r\n    Wide through the landscape of his dreams\r\n      The lordly Niger flowed;\r\n    Beneath the palm trees on the plain\r\n      Once more a king he strode;\r\n    And heard the tinkling caravans\r\n      Descend the mountain road.\r\n\r\n    He saw once more his dark-eyed queen\r\n      Among her children stand;\r\n    They clasped his neck, they kissed his cheeks,\r\n      They held him by the hand!--\r\n    A tear burst from the sleeper\'s lids\r\n      And fell into the sand.\r\n\r\n    And then at furious speed he rode\r\n      Along the Niger\'s bank;\r\n    His bridle-reins were golden chains,\r\n      And, with a martial clank,\r\n    At each leap he could feel his scabbard of steel\r\n      Smiting his stallion\'s flank.\r\n\r\n    Before him, like a blood-red flag,\r\n      The bright flamingoes flew;\r\n    From morn till night he followed their flight,\r\n      O\'er plains where the tamarind grew,\r\n    Till he saw the roofs of Caffre huts,\r\n      And the ocean rose to view.\r\n\r\n    At night he heard the lion roar,\r\n      And the hyena scream,\r\n    And the river-horse, as he crushed the reeds,\r\n      Beside some hidden stream;\r\n    And it passed, like a glorious roll of drums,\r\n      Through the triumph of his dream.\r\n\r\n    The forests, with their myriad tongues,\r\n      Shouted of liberty;\r\n    And the Blast of the Desert cried aloud,\r\n      With a voice so wild and free,\r\n    That he started in his sleep and smiled\r\n      At their tempestuous glee.\r\n\r\n    He did not feel the driver\'s whip,\r\n      Nor the burning heat of day;\r\n    For Death had illumined the Land of Sleep,\r\n      And his lifeless body lay\r\n    A worn-out fetter, that the soul\r\n      Had broken and thrown away!\r\n\r\nLONGFELLOW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact\r\nman.

He went to feed on the\r\nlily pads there.\r\n\r\nThe doe was daintily cropping tender leaves and turning from time to\r\ntime to regard her offspring. The fawn had taken his morning meal and\r\nnow lay curled up on a bed of moss.\r\n\r\nIf the mother stepped a pace or two farther away in feeding, the fawn\r\nmade a half-movement, as if to rise and follow her. If, in alarm, he\r\nuttered a plaintive cry, she bounded to him at once.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty picture,--maternal love on the one part, and happy trust\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nThe doe lifted her head with a quick motion. Had she heard something?\r\nProbably it was only the south wind in the balsams. There was silence\r\nall about in the forest. With an affectionate glance at her fawn, she\r\ncontinued picking up her breakfast.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly she started, head erect, eyes dilated, a tremor in her\r\nlimbs. She turned her head to the south; she listened intently.\r\n\r\nThere was a sound, a distinct, prolonged note, pervading the woods. It\r\nwas repeated. The doe had no doubt now. It was the baying of a\r\nhound--far off, at the foot of the mountain.\r\n\r\nTime enough to fly; time enough to put miles between her and the hound\r\nbefore he should come upon her fresh trail; yes, time enough. But there\r\nwas the fawn.\r\n\r\nThe cry of the hound was repeated, more distinct this time. The mother\r\nbounded away a few paces. The fawn started up with an anxious bleat. The\r\ndoe turned; she came back; she couldn\'t leave him.\r\n\r\nShe walked away toward the west, and the little thing skipped after her.\r\nIt was slow going for the slender legs, over the fallen logs and through\r\nthe rasping bushes. The doe bounded in advance and waited. The fawn\r\nscrambled after her, slipping and tumbling along, and whining a good\r\ndeal because his mother kept always moving away from him.\r\n\r\nWhenever the fawn caught up, he was quite content to frisk about. He\r\nwanted more breakfast, for one thing; and his mother wouldn\'t stand\r\nstill. She moved on continually; and his weak legs were tangled in the\r\nroots of the narrow deer path.\r\n\r\nSuddenly came a sound that threw the doe into a panic of terror,--a\r\nshort, sharp yelp, followed by a prolonged howl, caught up and re-echoed\r\nby other bayings along the mountain side. The danger was certain now; it\r\nwas near. She could not crawl on in this way; the dogs would soon be\r\nupon them. She turned again for flight. The fawn, scrambling after her,\r\ntumbled over, and bleated piteously. Flight with the fawn was\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe doe returned, stood by him, head erect and nostrils distended.\r\nPerhaps she was thinking. The fawn lay down contentedly, and the doe\r\nlicked him for a moment. Then, with the swiftness of a bird, she dashed\r\naway, and in a moment was lost in the forest. She went in the direction\r\nof the hounds.\r\n\r\nShe descended the slope of the mountain until she reached the more open\r\nforest of hard wood. She was going due east, when she turned away toward\r\nthe north, and kept on at a good pace.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes more she heard the sharp yelp of discovery, and then the\r\ndeep-mouthed howl of pursuit. The hounds had struck her trail where she\r\nturned, and the fawn was safe.\r\n\r\nFor the moment fear left her, and she bounded on with the exaltation of\r\ntriumph. For a quarter of an hour she went on at a slapping pace,\r\nclearing the bushes with bound after bound, flying over the fallen logs,\r\npausing neither for brook nor ravine. The baying of the hounds grew\r\nfainter behind.\r\n\r\nAfter running at high speed perhaps half a mile farther, it occurred to\r\nher that it would be safe now to turn to the west, and, by a wide\r\ncircuit, seek her fawn. But at the moment she heard a sound that chilled\r\nher heart. It was the cry of a hound to the west of her. There was\r\nnothing to do but to keep on, and on she went, with the noise of the\r\npack behind her.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes more she had passed into a hillside clearing. She heard\r\na tinkle of bells. Below her, down the mountain slope, were other\r\nclearings broken by patches of woods. A mile or two down lay the valley\r\nand the farmhouses. That way also her enemies were. Not a merciful heart\r\nin all that lovely valley. She hesitated; it was only for an instant.\r\n\r\nShe must cross the Slide Brook valley, if possible, and gain the\r\nmountain opposite. She bounded on; she stopped. What was that? From the\r\nvalley ahead came the cry of a searching hound. Every way was closed but\r\none, and that led straight down the mountain to the cluster of houses.\r\nThe hunted doe went down "the open," clearing the fences, flying along\r\nthe stony path.\r\n\r\nAs she approached Slide Brook, she saw a boy standing by a tree with a\r\nraised rifle. The dogs were not in sight, but she could hear them coming\r\ndown the hill. There was no time for hesitation. With a tremendous burst\r\nof speed she cleared the stream, and as she touched the bank heard the\r\n"ping" of a rifle bullet in the air above her. The cruel sound gave\r\nwings to the poor thing.\r\n\r\nIn a moment more she leaped into the travelled road. Women and children\r\nran to the doors and windows; men snatched their rifles. There were\r\ntwenty people who were just going to shoot her, when the doe leaped the\r\nroad fence, and went away across a marsh toward the foothills.\r\n\r\nBy this time the dogs, panting and lolling out their tongues, came\r\nswinging along, keeping the trail, like stupids, and consequently\r\nlosing ground when the deer doubled. But when the doe had got into the\r\ntimber, she heard the savage brutes howling across the meadow. (It is\r\nwell enough, perhaps, to say that nobody offered to shoot the dogs.)\r\n\r\nThe courage of the panting fugitive was not gone, but the fearful pace\r\nat which she had been going told on her. Her legs trembled, and her\r\nheart beat like a trip-hammer. She slowed her speed, but still fled up\r\nthe right bank of the stream. The dogs were gaining again, and she\r\ncrossed the broad, deep brook. The fording of the river threw the hounds\r\noff for a time. She used the little respite to push on until the baying\r\nwas faint in her ears.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon she staggered down the shoulder of Bartlett, and\r\nstood upon the shore of the lake. If she could put that piece of water\r\nbetween her and her pursuers, she would be safe. Had she strength to\r\nswim it?\r\n\r\nAt her first step into the water she saw a sight that sent her back with\r\na bound. There was a boat mid-lake; two men were in it. One was rowing;\r\nthe other had a gun in his hand. What should she do? With only a\r\nmoment\'s hesitation she plunged into the lake. Her tired legs could not\r\npropel the tired body rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe doe saw the boat nearing her. She turned to the shore whence she\r\ncame; the dogs were lapping the water and howling there. She turned\r\nagain to the centre of the lake. The brave, pretty creature was quite\r\nexhausted now. In a moment more the boat was on her, and the man at the\r\noars had leaned over and caught her.\r\n\r\n"Knock her on the head with that paddle!" he shouted to the gentleman in\r\nthe stern. The gentleman _was_ a gentleman, with a kind face. He took\r\nthe paddle in his hand. Just then the doe turned her head and looked at\r\nhim with her great appealing eyes.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do it! I can\'t do it!" and he dropped the paddle. "Oh, let her\r\ngo!"\r\n\r\nBut the guide slung the deer round, and whipped out his hunting-knife.\r\nAnd the gentleman ate that night of the venison.\r\n\r\nCHARLES DUDLEY WARNER\r\n(Adapted)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INCHCAPE ROCK\r\n\r\n\r\n    No stir in the air, no stir in the sea,\r\n    The ship was as still as she could be;\r\n    Her sails from heaven received no motion,\r\n    Her keel was steady in the ocean.\r\n\r\n    Without either sign or sound of their shock,\r\n    The waves flowed over the Inchcape Rock;\r\n    So little they rose, so little they fell,\r\n    They did not move the Inchcape Bell.\r\n\r\n    The pious Abbot of Aberbrothock\r\n    Had placed that bell on the Inchcape Rock;\r\n    On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung,\r\n    And over the waves its warning rung.\r\n\r\n    When the Rock was hid by the surge\'s swell,\r\n    The mariners heard the warning bell;\r\n    And then they knew the perilous Rock,\r\n    And blessed the Abbot of Aberbrothock.\r\n\r\n    The sun in heaven was shining gay;\r\n    All things were joyful on that day;\r\n    The sea-birds screamed as they wheeled round,\r\n    And there was joyance in their sound.\r\n\r\n    The buoy of the Inchcape Bell was seen,\r\n    A darker speck on the ocean green;\r\n    Sir Ralph the Rover walked his deck,\r\n    And he fixed his eye on the darker speck.\r\n\r\n    He felt the cheering power of spring;\r\n    It made him whistle, it made him sing:\r\n    His heart was mirthful to excess,\r\n    But the Rover\'s mirth was wickedness.\r\n\r\n    His eye was on the Inchcape float;\r\n    Quoth he: "My men, put out the boat,\r\n    And row me to the Inchcape Rock,\r\n    And I\'ll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothock."\r\n\r\n    The boat is lowered, the boatmen row,\r\n    And to the Inchcape Rock they go;\r\n    Sir Ralph bent over from the boat,\r\n    And he cut the bell from the Inchcape float.\r\n\r\n    Down sank the bell, with a gurgling sound,\r\n    The bubbles rose and burst around;\r\n    Quoth Sir Ralph: "The next who comes to the Rock\r\n    Won\'t bless the Abbot of Aberbrothock."\r\n\r\n    Sir Ralph the Rover sailed away;\r\n    He scoured the seas for many a day;\r\n    And now, grown rich with plundered store,\r\n    He steers his course for Scotland\'s shore.\r\n\r\n    So thick a haze o\'erspreads the sky\r\n    They cannot see the sun on high;\r\n    The wind hath blown a gale all day,\r\n    At evening it hath died away.\r\n\r\n    On the deck the Rover takes his stand;\r\n    So dark it is, they see no land.\r\n    Quoth Sir Ralph: "It will be lighter soon,\r\n    For there is the dawn of the rising moon."\r\n\r\n    "Canst hear," said one, "the breakers roar?\r\n    For methinks we should be near the shore."\r\n    "Now where we are I cannot tell,\r\n    But I wish we could hear the Inchcape Bell."\r\n\r\n    They hear no sound; the swell is strong;\r\n    Though the wind hath fallen, they drift along,\r\n    Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock;\r\n    Cried they: "It is the Inchcape Rock!"\r\n\r\n    Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair,\r\n    He cursed himself in his despair:\r\n    The waves rush in on every side;\r\n    The ship is sinking beneath the tide.\r\n\r\n    But, even in his dying fear,\r\n    One dreadful sound could the Rover hear,--\r\n    A sound as if, with the Inchcape Bell,\r\n    The fiends below were ringing his knell.\r\n\r\nSOUTHEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA ROUGH RIDE\r\n\r\n\r\n"Well, young ones, what be gaping at?"\r\n\r\n"Your mare," said I, standing stoutly up, being a tall boy now; "I never\r\nsaw such a beauty, sir. Will you let me have a ride on her?"\r\n\r\n"Think thou couldst ride her, lad? She will have no burden but mine.\r\nThou couldst never ride her! Tut! I would be loath to kill thee."\r\n\r\n"Ride her!" I cried, with the bravest scorn, for she looked so kind and\r\ngentle; "there never was a horse upon Exmoor but I could tackle in half\r\nan hour. Only I never ride upon saddle. Take those leathers off of her."\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with a dry little whistle, and thrust his hands into his\r\npockets, and so grinned that I could not stand it. And Annie laid hold\r\nof me in such a way that I was almost mad with her. And he laughed, and\r\napproved her for doing so. And the worst of all was--he said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Get away, Annie. Do you think I\'m a fool, good sir? Only trust me with\r\nher, and I will not override her."\r\n\r\n"For that I will go bail, my son. She is liker to override thee. But the\r\nground is soft to fall upon after all this rain. Now come out into the\r\nyard, young man, for the sake of your mother\'s cabbages. And the mellow\r\nstrawbed will be softer for thee, since pride must have its fall. I am\r\nthy mother\'s cousin, boy, and I\'m going up to the house. Tom Faggus is\r\nmy name, as everybody knows, and this is my young mare, Winnie."\r\n\r\nWhat a fool I must have been not to know it at once! Tom Faggus, the\r\ngreat highwayman, and his young blood mare, the strawberry.\r\n\r\nAlready her fame was noised abroad nearly as much as her master\'s, and\r\nmy longing to ride her grew tenfold, but fear came at the back of it.\r\nNot that I had the smallest fear of what the mare could do to me, by\r\nfair play and horse-trickery, but that the glory of sitting upon her\r\nseemed to be too great for me; especially as there were rumours abroad\r\nthat she was not a mare, after all, but a witch.\r\n\r\nMr. Faggus gave his mare a wink, and she walked demurely after him, a\r\nbright young thing, flowing over with life, yet dropping her soul to a\r\nhigher one, and led by love to anything, as the manner is of such\r\ncreatures, when they know what is best for them. Then Winnie trod\r\nlightly upon the straw, because it had soft muck under it, and her\r\ndelicate feet came back again.\r\n\r\n"Up for it still, boy, be ye?" Tom Faggus stopped, and the mare stopped\r\nthere; and they looked at me provokingly.\r\n\r\n"Is she able to leap, sir? There is good take-off on this side of the\r\nbrook."\r\n\r\nMr. Faggus laughed very quietly, turning round to Winnie so that she\r\nmight enter into it. And she, for her part, seemed to know exactly where\r\nthe fun lay.\r\n\r\n"Good tumble-off, you mean, my boy. Well, there can be small harm to\r\nthee. I am akin to thy family, and know the substance of their skulls."\r\n\r\n"Let me get up," said I, waxing wroth, for reasons I cannot tell you,\r\nbecause they are too manifold; "take off your saddle-bag things. I will\r\ntry not to squeeze her ribs in, unless she plays nonsense with me."\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Faggus was up on his mettle at this proud speech of mine, and\r\nJohn Fry was running up all the while, and Bill Dadds, and half a dozen\r\nothers. Tom Faggus gave one glance around, and then dropped all regard\r\nfor me. The high repute of his mare was at stake, and what was my life\r\ncompared to it? Through my defiance, and stupid ways, here was I in a\r\nduello, and my legs not come to their strength yet, and my arms as limp\r\nas a herring.\r\n\r\nSomething of this occurred to him, even in his wrath with me, for he\r\nspoke very softly to the filly, who now could scarcely subdue herself;\r\nbut she drew in her nostrils, and breathed to his breath, and did all\r\nshe could to answer him.\r\n\r\n"Not too hard, my dear," he said; "let him gently down on the mixen.\r\nThat will be quite enough." Then he turned the saddle off, and I was up\r\nin a moment. She began at first so easily, and pricked her ears so\r\nlovingly, and minced about as if pleased to find so light a weight upon\r\nher, that I thought she knew I could ride a little, and feared to show\r\nany capers. "Gee wugg, Polly!" cried I, for all the men were now looking\r\non, being then at the leaving-off time; "Gee wugg, Polly, and show what\r\nthou be\'est made of." With that I plugged my heels into her, and Billy\r\nDadds flung his hat up.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she outraged not, though her eyes were frightening Annie,\r\nand John Fry took a pick to keep him safe; but she curbed to and fro\r\nwith her strong forearms rising like springs ingathered, waiting and\r\nquivering grievously, and beginning to sweat about it. Then her master\r\ngave a shrill, clear whistle, when her ears were bent towards him, and\r\nI felt her form beneath me gathering up like whalebone, and her hind\r\nlegs coming under her, and I knew that I was in for it.\r\n\r\nFirst she reared upright in the air, and struck me full on the nose with\r\nher comb, till I bled worse than Robin Snell made me; and then down with\r\nher forefeet deep in the straw, and with her hind feet going to heaven.\r\nFinding me stick to her still like wax, for my mettle was up as hers\r\nwas, away she flew with me swifter than ever I went before or since, I\r\ntrow.\r\n\r\nShe drove full head at the cob wall--"Oh, Jack, slip off!" screamed\r\nAnnie--then she turned like light, when I thought to crush her, and\r\nground my left knee against it. "Dear me!" I cried, for my breeches were\r\nbroken, and short words went the furthest--"if you kill me, you shall\r\ndie with me." Then she took the courtyard gate at a leap, knocking my\r\nwords between my teeth, and then right over a quick-set hedge, as if the\r\nsky were a breath to her; and away for the water meadows, while I lay on\r\nher neck like a child, and wished I had never been born.\r\n\r\nStraight away, all in the front of the wind, and scattering clouds\r\naround her, all I knew of the speed we made was the frightful flash of\r\nher shoulders, and her mane like trees in a tempest. I felt the earth\r\nunder us rushing away, and the air left far behind us, and my breath\r\ncame and went, and I prayed to God, and was sorry to be so late of it.\r\n\r\nAll the long swift while, without power of thought, I clung to her crest\r\nand shoulders, and was proud of holding on so long, though sure of being\r\nbeaten. Then in her fury at feeling me still, she rushed at another\r\ndevice for it, and leaped the wide water-trough sideways across, to and\r\nfro, till no breath was left in me. The hazel boughs took me too hard in\r\nthe face, and the tall dog-briers got hold of me, and the ache of my\r\nback was like crimping a fish, till I longed to give it up, thoroughly\r\nbeaten, and lie there and die in the cresses.\r\n\r\nBut there came a shrill whistle from up the home hill, where the people\r\nhad hurried to watch us, and the mare stopped as if with a bullet, then\r\nset off for home with the speed of a swallow, and going as smoothly and\r\nsilently. I never had dreamed of such delicate motion, fluent, and\r\ngraceful, and ambient, soft as the breeze flitting over the flowers, but\r\nswift as the summer lightning.\r\n\r\nI sat up again, but my strength was all spent, and no time left to\r\nrecover it; and though she rose at our gate like a bird, I tumbled off\r\ninto the soft mud.\r\n\r\n"Well done, lad," Mr. Faggus said, good-naturedly; for all were now\r\ngathered round me, as I rose from the ground, somewhat tottering, and\r\nmiry, and crest-fallen, but otherwise none the worse (having fallen upon\r\nmy head, which is of uncommon substance); "not at all bad work, my boy;\r\nwe may teach you to ride by and by, I see; I thought not to see you\r\nstick on so long--"\r\n\r\n"I should have stuck on much longer, sir, if her sides had not been wet.\r\nShe was so slippery--"\r\n\r\n"Boy, thou art right. She hath given many the slip. Ha! ha! Vex not,\r\nJack, that I laugh at thee. She is like a sweetheart to me, and better\r\nthan any of them be. It would have gone to my heart if thou hadst\r\nconquered. None but I can ride my Winnie mare."\r\n\r\nR. D.

There were no other vessels in sight,--much to our\r\nsatisfaction,--the wind was light, with a cloudless sky, and the whale\r\nwas dead to leeward of us. We sped along at a good rate towards our\r\nprospective victim, who was, in his leisurely enjoyment of life, calmly\r\nlolling on the surface, occasionally lifting his enormous tail out of\r\nwater and letting it fall flat upon the surface with a boom audible for\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nWe were, as usual, first boat; but, much to the mate\'s annoyance, when\r\nwe were a short half-mile from the whale our main-sheet parted. It\r\nbecame immediately necessary to roll the sail up, lest its flapping\r\nshould alarm the watchful monster, and this delayed us sufficiently to\r\nallow the other boats to shoot ahead of us. Thus the second mate got\r\nfast some seconds before we arrived on the scene, seeing which, we\r\nfurled sail, unshipped the mast, and went in on him with the oars only.\r\nAt first the proceedings were quite of the usual character, our chief\r\nwielding his lance in most brilliant fashion, while not being fast to\r\nthe animal allowed us much greater freedom in our evolutions; but that\r\nfatal habit of the mate\'s--of allowing his boat to take care of herself\r\nso long as he was getting in some good home-thrusts--once more asserted\r\nitself. Although the whale was exceedingly vigorous, churning the sea\r\ninto yeasty foam over an enormous area, there we wallowed close to him,\r\nright in the middle of the turmoil, actually courting disaster.\r\n\r\nHe had just settled down for a moment, when, glancing over the gunwale,\r\nI saw his tail, like a vast shadow, sweeping away from us towards the\r\nsecond mate, who was lying off the other side of him. Before I had time\r\nto think, the mighty mass of gristle leaped into the sunshine, curved\r\nback from us like a huge bow. Then with a roar it came at us, released\r\nfrom its tension of Heaven knows how many tons. Full on the broadside it\r\nstruck us, sending every soul but me flying out of the wreckage as if\r\nfired from catapults. I did not go because my foot was jammed somehow in\r\nthe well of the boat, but the wrench nearly pulled my thighbone out of\r\nits socket. I had hardly released my foot when, towering above me, came\r\nthe colossal head of the great creature, as he ploughed through the\r\nbundle of _d\xc3\xa9bris_ that had just been a boat. There was an appalling\r\nroar of water in my ears, and darkness that might be felt all around.\r\nYet, in the midst of it all, one thought predominated as clearly as if I\r\nhad been turning it over in my mind in the quiet of my bunk\r\naboard--"What if he should swallow me?" Nor to this day can I understand\r\nhow I escaped the portals of his gullet, which, of course, gaped wide as\r\na church door. But the agony of holding my breath soon overpowered every\r\nother feeling and thought, till just as something was going to snap\r\ninside my head, I rose to the surface. I was surrounded by a welter of\r\nbloody froth, which, made it impossible for me to see; but oh, the air\r\nwas sweet!\r\n\r\nI struck out blindly, instinctively, although I could feel so strong an\r\neddy that voluntary progress was out of the question. My hand touched\r\nand clung to a rope, which immediately towed me in some direction--I\r\nneither knew nor cared whither. Soon the motion ceased, and, with a\r\nseaman\'s instinct, I began to haul myself along by the rope I grasped,\r\nalthough no definite idea was in my mind as to where it was attached.\r\nPresently I came butt up against something solid, the feel of which\r\ngathered all my scattered wits into a compact knob of dread. It was the\r\nwhale! "Any port in a storm," I murmured, beginning to haul away again\r\non my friendly line. By dint of hard work I pulled myself right up the\r\nsloping, slippery bank of blubber, until I reached the iron, which, as\r\nluck would have it, was planted in that side of the carcass now\r\nuppermost.\r\n\r\nCarcass I said--well, certainly I had no idea of there being any life\r\nremaining within the vast mass beneath me; yet I had hardly time to take\r\na couple of turns round myself with the rope (or whale-line, as I had\r\nproved it to be), when I felt the great animal quiver all over, and\r\nbegin to forge ahead. I was now composed enough to remember that help\r\ncould not be far away, and that my rescue, providing that I could keep\r\nabove water, was but a question of a few minutes. But I was hardly\r\nprepared for the whale\'s next move. Being very near his end, the boat,\r\nor boats, had drawn off a bit, I supposed, for I could see nothing of\r\nthem. Then I remembered the flurry.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment it began; and there was I, who, with fearful\r\nadmiration had so often watched the titanic convulsions of a dying\r\ncachalot, actually involved in them. The turns were off my body, but I\r\nwas able to twist a couple of turns round my arms, which, in case of his\r\nsounding, I could readily let go. Then all was lost in roar and rush, as\r\nof the heart of some mighty cataract, during which I was sometimes\r\nabove, sometimes beneath, the water, but always clinging, with every\r\nounce of energy still left, to the line. Now, one thought was\r\nuppermost--"What if he should breach?" I had seen them do so when in\r\nflurry, leaping full twenty feet in the air. Then I prayed.\r\n\r\nQuickly as all the preceding changes had passed, came perfect peace.\r\nThere I lay, still alive, but so weak that, although I could feel the\r\nturns slipping off my arms, and knew that I should slide off the slope\r\nof the whale\'s side into the sea if they did, I could make no effort to\r\nsecure myself. Everything then passed away from me, just as if I had\r\ngone to sleep. I do not at all understand how I kept my position, nor\r\nhow long, but I awoke to the blessed sound of voices, and saw the second\r\nmate\'s boat alongside.\r\n\r\nFRANK T.

F. DARNELL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMON AND PYTHIAS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Syracuse there was so hard a ruler that the people made a plot to\r\ndrive him out of the city. The plot was discovered, and the king\r\ncommanded that the leaders should be put to death. One of these, named\r\nDamon, lived at some distance from Syracuse. He asked that before he was\r\nput to death he might be allowed to go home to say good-bye to his\r\nfamily, promising that he would then come back to die at the appointed\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe king did not believe that he would keep his word, and said: "I will\r\nnot let you go unless you find some friend who will come and stay in\r\nyour place. Then, if you are not back on the day set for execution, I\r\nshall put your friend to death in your stead." The king thought to\r\nhimself: "Surely no one will ever take the place of a man condemned to\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\nNow, Damon had a very dear friend, named Pythias, who at once came\r\nforward and offered to stay in prison while Damon was allowed to go\r\naway. The king was very much surprised, but he had given his word; Damon\r\nwas therefore permitted to leave for home, while Pythias was shut up in\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nMany days passed, the time for the execution was close at hand, and\r\nDamon had not come back. The king, curious to see how Pythias would\r\nbehave, now that death seemed so near, went to the prison.\r\n\r\n"Your friend will never return," he said to Pythias.\r\n\r\n"You are wrong," was the answer. "Damon will be here if he can possibly\r\ncome. But he has to travel by sea, and the winds have been blowing the\r\nwrong way for several days. However, it is much better that I should die\r\nthan he. I have no wife and no children, and I love my friend so well\r\nthat it would be easier to die for him than to live without him. So I am\r\nhoping and praying that he may be delayed until my head has fallen."\r\n\r\nThe king went away more puzzled than ever.\r\n\r\nThe fatal day arrived but Damon had not come. Pythias was brought\r\nforward and led upon the scaffold. "My prayers are heard," he cried. "I\r\nshall be permitted to die for my friend. But mark my words. Damon is\r\nfaithful and true; you will yet have reason to know that he has done his\r\nutmost to be here!"\r\n\r\nJust at this moment a man came galloping up at full speed, on a horse\r\ncovered with foam! It was Damon. In an instant he was on the scaffold,\r\nand had Pythias in his arms. "My beloved friend," he cried, "the gods be\r\npraised that you are safe. What agony have I suffered in the fear that\r\nmy delay was putting your life in danger!"\r\n\r\nThere was no joy in the face of Pythias, for he did not care to live if\r\nhis friend must die. But the king had heard all. At last he was forced\r\nto believe in the unselfish friendship of these two. His hard heart\r\nmelted at the sight, and he set them both free, asking only that they\r\nwould be his friends, also.\r\n\r\nCHARLOTTE M.

The first snow\r\nsends a thrill of joy through every fibre of such a boy, and a thousand\r\ndelights crowd into his mind. The gliding, falling coasters on the\r\nhills, the passing sleighs with niches on the runners for his feet, the\r\nflying snowballs, the sliding-places, the broad, tempting ice, all whirl\r\nthrough his mind in a delightful panorama, and he hurries out to catch\r\nthe elusive flakes in his outstretched hands and to shout aloud in the\r\ngladness of his heart. And the black squirrel becomes a boy with the\r\nfirst snow. What a pity he cannot shout! There is a superabundant joy\r\nand life in his long, graceful bounds, when his beautiful form, in its\r\nstriking contrast with the white snow, seems magnified to twice its real\r\nsize. Perhaps there is vanity as well as joy in his lithe, bounding\r\nmotions among the naked trees, for nature seems to have done her utmost\r\nto provide a setting that would best display his graces of form and\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nWhen the falling snow clings in light, airy masses on the spruces and\r\npines, and festoons the naked tracery and clustering winter buds of the\r\nmaples--when the still air seems to fix every twig and branch and\r\nclinging mass of snow in a solid medium of crystal, the spell of\r\nstillness is broken by the silent but joyful leaps of the hurrying\r\nsquirrel. How alive he seems, in contrast with the silence of the snow,\r\nas his outlines contrast with its perfect white! His body curves and\r\nelongates with regular undulations, as he measures off the snow with\r\ntwin footprints. Away in the distance he is still visible among the\r\nnaked trunks, a moving patch of animated blackness. His free, regular\r\nfootprints are all about, showing where he has run hither and thither,\r\nwith no apparent purpose except to manifest his joy in life.\r\n\r\nHis red-haired cousin comes to a lofty opening in a hollow tree and\r\nlooks out with an expression of disappointment on his face. He does not\r\nlike the snow-covered landscape spread out so artistically before him.\r\nIt makes him tired, and he has not enough energy to scold an intruder,\r\nas he would in the comfortable days of summer. No amount of coaxing or\r\ntapping will tempt him from his lofty watch-tower, or win more\r\nrecognition than a silent look of weary discontent. Another cousin, the\r\nchipmunk, no longer displays his daintily-striped coat. Oblivious in his\r\nburrow, he is sleeping away the days, and waiting for a more congenial\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nBut the black squirrel, now among the branches of an elm, is twitching\r\nfrom one rigid attitude to another, electrified by the crisp atmosphere\r\nand the inspiration of the snow. Again he is leaping over the white\r\nsurface to clamber up the repellent bark of a tall hickory. Among the\r\nlarger limbs he disappears. As he never attempts to hide, he must have\r\nretired into his own dwelling to partake of the store laid by in the\r\nseason of plenty. Hickory nuts are his favourite food, and the hard\r\nshells seem but an appetizing relish. He knows the value of frugality,\r\nand gathers them before they are ripe, throwing down the shrivelled and\r\nunfilled, that the boys may not annoy him with stones and sticks. In\r\nwinter he is the happiest of all the woodland family. He does not yield\r\nto the drowsy, numbing influence of the cold, nor to the depression of a\r\nseason of scanty fare, but bounds along from tree to tree, inspired by\r\nthe subtle spirit of winter and revelling in the joy of being alive.\r\n\r\nS.

He fished for some time with small\r\nsuccess, not a fish would rise to him; but as he prowled along the bank,\r\nhe was presently aware of mighty ones feeding in a pool on the opposite\r\nside, under the shade of a huge willow-tree. The stream was deep here,\r\nbut some fifty yards below was a shallow, for which he made off\r\nhot-foot; and forgetting landlords, keepers, solemn prohibitions of the\r\nDoctor, and everything else, pulled up his trousers, plunged across, and\r\nin three minutes was creeping along on all fours towards the clump of\r\nwillows.\r\n\r\nIt isn\'t often that great chub, or any other coarse fish, are in earnest\r\nabout anything; but just then they were thoroughly bent on feeding, and\r\nin half an hour Master Tom had deposited three thumping fellows at the\r\nfoot of the giant willow. As he was baiting for a fourth pounder, and\r\njust going to throw in again, he became aware of a man coming up the\r\nbank not one hundred yards off. Another look told him that it was the\r\nunder-keeper. Could he reach the shallow before him? No, not carrying\r\nhis rod. Nothing for it but the tree. So Tom laid his bones to it,\r\nshinning up as fast as he could and dragging up his rod after him. He\r\nhad just time to reach and crouch along upon a huge branch some ten feet\r\nup, which stretched out over the river, when the keeper arrived at the\r\nclump.\r\n\r\nTom\'s heart beat fast as he came under the tree; two steps more and he\r\nwould have passed, when, as ill-luck would have it, the gleam on the\r\nscales of the dead fish caught his eye, and he made a dead point at the\r\nfoot of the tree. He picked up the fish one by one; his eye and touch\r\ntold him that they had been alive and feeding within the hour.\r\n\r\nTom crouched lower along the branch, and heard the keeper beating the\r\nclump. "If I could only get the rod hidden," thought he, and began\r\ngently shifting it to get it alongside of him: "willow-trees don\'t throw\r\nout straight hickory shoots twelve feet long, with no leaves, worse\r\nluck." Alas! the keeper catches the rustle, and then a sight of the rod,\r\nand then of Tom\'s hand and arm.\r\n\r\n"Oh, be up ther\', be \'ee?" says he, running under the tree. "Now you\r\ncome down this minute."\r\n\r\n"Tree\'d at last," thinks Tom, making no answer, and keeping as close as\r\npossible, but working away at the rod, which he takes to pieces. "I\'m in\r\nfor it, unless I can starve him out."\r\n\r\nAnd then he begins to meditate getting along the branch for a plunge,\r\nand scramble to the other side; but the small branches are so thick,\r\nand the opposite bank so difficult, that the keeper will have lots of\r\ntime to get round by the ford before he can get out, so he gives that\r\nup. And now he hears the keeper beginning to scramble up the trunk. That\r\nwill never do; so he scrambles himself back to where his branch joins\r\nthe trunk, and stands with lifted rod.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Velveteens, mind your fingers if you come any higher."\r\n\r\nThe keeper stops and looks up, and then with a grin says: "Oh! be you,\r\nbe it, young measter? Well, here\'s luck. Now I tells \'ee to come down at\r\nonce, and \'t\'ll be best for \'ee."\r\n\r\n"Thank \'ee, Velveteens, I\'m very comfortable," said Tom, shortening the\r\nrod in his hand, and preparing for battle.\r\n\r\n"Werry well, please yourself," says the keeper, descending, however, to\r\nthe ground again, and taking his seat on the bank. "I bean\'t in no\r\nhurry, so you med take your time. I\'ll larn \'ee to gee honest folk names\r\nafore I\'ve done with \'ee."\r\n\r\n"My luck as usual," thinks Tom; "what a fool I was to give him a black!\r\nIf I\'d called him \'keeper,\' now, I might get off. The return match is\r\nall his way."\r\n\r\nThe keeper quietly proceeded to take out his pipe, fill, and light it,\r\nkeeping an eye on Tom, who now sat disconsolately across the branch,\r\nlooking at the keeper--a pitiful sight for men and fishes. The more he\r\nthought of it the less he liked it.\r\n\r\n"It must be getting near second calling-over," thinks he. Keeper smokes\r\non stolidly. "If he takes me up, I shall be flogged safe enough. I can\'t\r\nsit here all night. Wonder if he\'ll rise at silver."\r\n\r\n"I say, keeper," said he, meekly, "let me go for two bob?"\r\n\r\n"Not for twenty neither," grunts his persecutor.\r\n\r\nAnd so they sat on till long past second calling-over; and the sun came\r\nslanting in through the willow-branches, and telling of locking-up near\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming down, keeper," said Tom at last, with a sigh, fairly tired\r\nout. "Now what are you going to do?"\r\n\r\n"Walk \'ee up to School, and give \'ee over to the Doctor; them\'s my\r\norders," says Velveteens, knocking the ashes out of his fourth pipe, and\r\nstanding up and shaking himself.\r\n\r\n"Very good," said Tom; "but hands off, you know. I\'ll go with you\r\nquietly, so no collaring or that sort of thing."\r\n\r\nKeeper looked at him a minute: "Werry good," said he at last. And so Tom\r\ndescended, and wended his way drearily by the side of the keeper up to\r\nthe School-house, where they arrived just at locking-up.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the School-gates, the Tadpole and several others who were\r\nstanding there caught the state of things, and rushed out, crying,\r\n"Rescue!" but Tom shook his head, so they only followed to the Doctor\'s\r\ngate, and went back sorely puzzled.\r\n\r\nHow changed and stern the Doctor seemed from the last time that Tom was\r\nup there, as the keeper told the story, not omitting to state how Tom\r\nhad called him blackguard names. "Indeed, sir," broke in the culprit,\r\n"it was only Velveteens." The Doctor only asked one question.\r\n\r\n"You know the rule about the banks, Brown?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then wait for me to-morrow, after first lesson."\r\n\r\n"I thought so," muttered Tom.\r\n\r\n"And about the rod, sir?" went on the keeper. "Master\'s told we as we\r\nmight have all the rods----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, please, sir," broke in Tom, "the rod isn\'t mine."\r\n\r\nThe Doctor looked puzzled, but the keeper, who was a good-hearted\r\nfellow, and melted at Tom\'s evident distress, gave up his claim.\r\n\r\nTom was flogged next morning, and a few days afterwards met Velveteens,\r\nand presented him with half a crown for giving up the rod claim, and\r\nthey became sworn friends; and I regret to say that Tom had many more\r\nfish from under the willow that May-fly season, and was never caught\r\nagain by Velveteens.\r\n\r\nHUGHES: "Tom Brown\'s School Days."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n    Into the sunshine,\r\n      Full of the light,\r\n    Leaping and flashing\r\n      From morn till night!\r\n\r\n    Into the moonlight,\r\n      Whiter than snow,\r\n    Waving so flower-like\r\n      When the winds blow!\r\n\r\n    Into the starlight,\r\n      Rushing in spray,\r\n    Happy at midnight,\r\n      Happy by day;\r\n\r\n    Ever in motion,\r\n      Blithesome and cheery,\r\n    Still climbing heavenward\r\n      Never aweary;--\r\n\r\n    Glad of all weathers;\r\n      Still seeming best,\r\n    Upward or downward,\r\n      Motion thy rest;--\r\n\r\n    Full of a nature\r\n      Nothing can tame,\r\n    Changed every moment,\r\n      Ever the same;--\r\n\r\n    Ceaseless aspiring,\r\n      Ceaseless content,\r\n    Darkness or sunshine\r\n      Thy element;--\r\n\r\n    Glorious fountain!\r\n      Let my heart be\r\n    Fresh, changeful, constant,\r\n      Upward, like thee!\r\n\r\nLOWELL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAK, BREAK, BREAK\r\n\r\n\r\n    Break, break, break,\r\n      On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!\r\n    And I would that my tongue could utter\r\n      The thoughts that arise in me.\r\n\r\n    O well for the fisherman\'s boy,\r\n      That he shouts with his sister at play!\r\n    O well for the sailor lad,\r\n      That he sings in his boat on the bay!\r\n\r\n    And the stately ships go on\r\n      To their haven under the hill;\r\n    But O for the touch of a vanish\'d hand,\r\n      And the sound of a voice that is still!\r\n\r\n    Break, break, break,\r\n      At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!\r\n    But the tender grace of a day that is dead\r\n      Will never come back to me.\r\n\r\nTENNYSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTry to frequent the company of your betters.

Note what great men admired: they admired great things;\r\nnarrow spirits admire basely and worship meanly.\r\n\r\nTHACKERAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BED OF PROCRUSTES\r\n\r\n\r\nA very tall and strong man, dressed in rich garments, came down to meet\r\nTheseus. On his arms were golden bracelets, and round his neck a collar\r\nof jewels; and he came forward, bowing courteously, and held out both\r\nhis hands, and spoke:\r\n\r\n"Welcome, fair youth, to these mountains; happy am I to have met you!\r\nFor what greater pleasure to a good man than to entertain strangers? But\r\nI see that you are weary. Come up to my castle, and rest yourself\r\nawhile."\r\n\r\n"I give you thanks," said Theseus; "but I am in haste to go up the\r\nvalley."\r\n\r\n"Alas! you have wandered far from the right way, and you cannot reach\r\nyour journey\'s end to-night, for there are many miles of mountain\r\nbetween you and it, and steep passes, and cliffs dangerous after\r\nnightfall. It is well for you that I met you, for my whole joy is to\r\nfind strangers, and to feast them at my castle, and hear tales from them\r\nof foreign lands. Come up with me, and eat the best of venison, and\r\ndrink the rich red wine, and sleep upon my famous bed, of which all\r\ntravellers say that they never saw the like. For whatsoever the\r\nstature of my guest, however tall or short, that bed fits him to a hair,\r\nand he sleeps on it as he never slept before." And he laid hold on\r\nTheseus\' hands, and would not let him go.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NIAGARA FALLS]\r\n\r\nTheseus wished to go forwards: but he was ashamed to seem churlish to so\r\nhospitable a man; and he was curious to see that wondrous bed; and\r\nbeside, he was hungry and weary: yet he shrank from the man, he knew not\r\nwhy; for, though his voice was gentle, it was dry and husky like a\r\ntoad\'s; and though his eyes were gentle, they were dull and cold like\r\nstones. But he consented, and went with the man up a glen which led from\r\nthe road, under the dark shadow of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nAnd as they went up, the glen grew narrower, and the cliffs higher and\r\ndarker, and beneath them a torrent roared, half seen between bare\r\nlimestone crags. And around them was neither tree nor bush, while the\r\nsnow-blasts swept down the glen, cutting and chilling, till a horror\r\nfell on Theseus as he looked round at that doleful place. And he said at\r\nlast: "Your castle stands, it seems, in a dreary region."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but once within it, hospitality makes all things cheerful. But who\r\nare these?" and he looked back, and Theseus also; and far below, along\r\nthe road which they had left, came a string of laden asses, and\r\nmerchants walking by them, watching their ware.\r\n\r\n"Ah, poor souls!" said the stranger. "Well for them that I looked back\r\nand saw them! And well for me, too, for I shall have the more guests at\r\nmy feast. Wait awhile till I go down and call them, and we will eat and\r\ndrink together the livelong night. Happy am I, to whom Heaven sends so\r\nmany guests at once!"\r\n\r\nAnd he ran back down the hill, waving his hand and shouting to the\r\nmerchants, while Theseus went slowly up the steep pass.\r\n\r\nBut as he went up he met an aged man, who had been gathering driftwood\r\nin the torrent-bed. He had laid down his faggot in the road, and was\r\ntrying to lift it again to his shoulder. And when he saw Theseus, he\r\ncalled to him and said:\r\n\r\n"O fair youth, help me up with my burden, for my limbs are stiff and\r\nweak with years."\r\n\r\nThen Theseus lifted the burden on his back. And the old man blessed him,\r\nand then looked earnestly upon him, and said:\r\n\r\n"Who are you, fair youth, and wherefore travel you this doleful road?"\r\n\r\n"Who I am my parents know; but I travel this doleful road because I have\r\nbeen invited by a hospitable man, who promises to feast me and to make\r\nme sleep upon I know not what wondrous bed."\r\n\r\nThen the old man clapped his hands together and cried:\r\n\r\n"Know, fair youth, that you are going to torment and to death, for he\r\nwho met you (I will requite your kindness by another) is a robber and a\r\nmurderer of men. Whatsoever stranger he meets he entices him hither to\r\ndeath; and as for this bed of which he speaks, truly it fits all comers,\r\nyet none ever rose alive off it save me."\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked Theseus, astonished.\r\n\r\n"Because, if a man be too tall for it, he lops his limbs till they be\r\nshort enough, and if he be too short, he stretches his limbs till they\r\nbe long enough; but me only he spared, seven weary years agone; for I\r\nalone of all fitted his bed exactly, so he spared me, and made me his\r\nslave. And once I was a wealthy merchant, and dwelt in a great city; but\r\nnow I hew wood and draw water for him, the torment of all mortal men."\r\n\r\nThen Theseus said nothing; but he ground his teeth together.\r\n\r\n"Escape, then," said the old man, "for he will have no pity on thy\r\nyouth. But yesterday he brought up hither a young man and a maiden, and\r\nfitted them upon his bed; and the young man\'s hands and feet he cut off,\r\nbut the maiden\'s limbs he stretched until she died, and so both perished\r\nmiserably--but I am tired of weeping over the slain. And therefore he is\r\ncalled Procrustes, the stretcher. Flee from him: yet whither will you\r\nflee? The cliffs are steep, and who can climb them? and there is no\r\nother road."\r\n\r\nBut Theseus laid his hand upon the old man\'s mouth, and said: "There is\r\nno need to flee;" and he turned to go down the pass.\r\n\r\n"Do not tell him that I have warned you, or he will kill me by some evil\r\ndeath;" and the old man screamed after him down the glen; but Theseus\r\nstrode on in his wrath.\r\n\r\nAnd he said to himself: "This is an ill-ruled land; when shall I have\r\ndone ridding it of monsters?" And, as he spoke, Procrustes came up the\r\nhill, and all the merchants with him, smiling and talking gaily. And\r\nwhen he saw Theseus, he cried: "Ah, fair young guest, have I kept you\r\ntoo long waiting?"\r\n\r\nBut Theseus answered: "The man who stretches his guests upon a bed and\r\nhews off their hands and feet, what shall be done to him, when right is\r\ndone throughout the land?"\r\n\r\nThen Procrustes\' countenance changed, and his cheeks grew as green as a\r\nlizard, and he felt for his sword in haste; but Theseus leaped on him,\r\nand cried:\r\n\r\n"Is this true, my host, or is it false?" and he clasped Procrustes round\r\nwaist and elbow, so that he could not draw his sword.\r\n\r\n"Is this true, my host, or is it false!" But Procrustes answered never a\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThen Theseus flung him from him, and lifted up his dreadful club; and\r\nbefore Procrustes could strike him, he had struck and felled him to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAnd once again he struck him; and his evil soul fled forth, squeaking\r\nlike a bat into the darkness of a cave.\r\n\r\nThen Theseus stripped him of his gold ornaments, and went up to his\r\nhouse, and found there great wealth and treasure, which he had stolen\r\nfrom the passers-by. And he called the people of the country, whom\r\nProcrustes had spoiled a long time, and divided the spoil among them,\r\nand went down the mountains, and away.\r\n\r\nKINGSLEY: "The Heroes."\r\n(Adapted)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"BOB WHITE"\r\n\r\n\r\n    I see you, on the zigzag rails,\r\n      You cheery little fellow!\r\n    While purple leaves are whirling down,\r\n      And scarlet, brown, and yellow.\r\n    I hear you when the air is full\r\n      Of snow-down of the thistle;\r\n    All in your speckled jacket trim,\r\n      "Bob White!

You know what\r\nbeaver is worth and the trouble we have to take it. You call yourselves\r\nour brothers, and yet will not give us what those give who make no such\r\nprofession. Accept our gifts, and let us barter, or we will visit you\r\nno more. We have but to travel a hundred leagues and we will encounter\r\nthe English, whose offers we have heard."\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of this harangue, silence reigned for some moments.\r\nAll eyes were turned on the two white traders. Feeling that now or never\r\nwas the time to exhibit firmness, Radisson, without rising to his feet,\r\naddressed the whole assemblage in haughty accents.\r\n\r\n"Whom dost thou wish I should answer? I have heard a dog bark; when a\r\nman shall speak, he will see I know how to defend my conduct and my\r\nterms. We love our brothers and we deserve their love in return. For\r\nhave we not saved them all from the treachery of the English?"\r\n\r\nUttering these words fearlessly, he leaped to his feet and drew a long\r\nhunting-knife from his belt. Seizing by the scalp-lock the chief of the\r\ntribe, who had already adopted him as his son, he asked: "Who art thou?"\r\nTo which the chief responded, as was customary: "Thy father."\r\n\r\n"Then," cried Radisson, "if that is so, and thou art my father, speak\r\nfor me. Thou art the master of my goods; but as for that dog who has\r\nspoken, what is he doing in this company? Let him go to his brothers,\r\nthe English, at the head of the Bay. Or he need not travel so far. He\r\nmay, if he chooses, see them starving and helpless on yonder island;\r\nanswering to my words of command.\r\n\r\n"I know how to speak to my Indian father," continued Radisson, "of the\r\nperils of the woods, of the abandonment of his squaws and children, of\r\nthe risks of hunger and the peril of death by foes. All these you avoid\r\nby trading with us here. But although I am mightily angry, I will take\r\npity on this wretch and let him still live. Go," addressing the brave\r\nwith his weapon outstretched, "take this as my gift to you, and depart.\r\nWhen you meet your brothers, the English, tell them my name, and add\r\nthat we are soon coming to treat them and their factory yonder as we\r\nhave treated this one."\r\n\r\nThe speaker knew enough of the Indian character, especially in affairs\r\nof trade, to be aware that a point once yielded them is never recovered.\r\nAnd it is but just to say that the terms he then made of three axes for\r\na beaver were thereafter adopted, and that his firmness saved the\r\nCompany many a cargo of these implements. His harangue produced an\r\nimmediate impression upon all save the humiliated brave, who declared\r\nthat, if the Assiniboines came hither to barter, he would lie in ambush\r\nand kill them.\r\n\r\nThe French trader\'s reply to this was, to the Indian mind, a terrible\r\none.\r\n\r\n"I will myself travel into thy country," said he, "and eat sagamite in\r\nthy grandmother\'s skull."\r\n\r\nWhile the brave and his small circle of friends were livid with fear and\r\nanger, Radisson ordered three fathoms of tobacco to be distributed;\r\nobserving, contemptuously, to the hostile minority that, as for them,\r\nthey might go and smoke women\'s tobacco in the country of the lynxes.\r\nThe barter began and, when at nightfall the Indians departed, not a skin\r\nwas left amongst them.\r\n\r\nBECKLES WILLSON: "The Great Company."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROOK\r\n\r\n\r\n    I come from haunts of coot and hern,\r\n      I make a sudden sally,\r\n    And sparkle out among the fern,\r\n      To bicker down a valley.\r\n\r\n    By thirty hills I hurry down,\r\n      Or slip between the ridges,\r\n    By twenty thorps, a little town,\r\n      And half a hundred bridges.\r\n\r\n    Till last by Philip\'s farm I flow\r\n      To join the brimming river,\r\n    For men may come and men may go,\r\n      But I go on for ever.\r\n\r\n    I chatter over stony ways,\r\n      In little sharps and trebles,\r\n    I bubble into eddying bays,\r\n      I babble on the pebbles.\r\n\r\n    With many a curve my banks I fret\r\n      By many a field and fallow,\r\n    And many a fairy foreland set\r\n      With willow-weed and mallow.\r\n\r\n    I chatter, chatter, as I flow\r\n      To join the brimming river,\r\n    For men may come and men may go,\r\n      But I go on for ever.\r\n\r\n    I wind about, and in and out,\r\n      With here a blossom sailing,\r\n    And here and there a lusty trout,\r\n      And here and there a grayling,\r\n\r\n    And here and there a foamy flake\r\n      Upon me, as I travel\r\n    With many a silvery waterbreak\r\n      Above the golden gravel,\r\n\r\n    And draw them all along, and flow\r\n      To join the brimming river,\r\n    For men may come and men may go,\r\n      But I go on for ever.\r\n\r\n    I steal by lawns and grassy plots,\r\n      I slide by hazel covers;\r\n    I move the sweet forget-me-nots\r\n      That grow for happy lovers.\r\n\r\n    I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,\r\n      Among my skimming swallows;\r\n    I make the netted sunbeam dance\r\n      Against my sandy shallows.\r\n\r\n    I murmur under moon and stars\r\n      In brambly wildernesses;\r\n    I linger by my shingly bars;\r\n      I loiter round my cresses;\r\n\r\n    And out again I curve and flow\r\n      To join the brimming river,\r\n    For men may come and men may go,\r\n      But I go on for ever.\r\n\r\nTENNYSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs good almost kill a man as kill a good book.

The owner of the cabin, a shiftless fellow who\r\nspent his days for the most part at the corner tavern three miles\r\ndistant, had suddenly grown disgusted with a land wherein one must work\r\nto live, and had betaken himself with his seven-year-old boy to seek\r\nsome more indolent clime.\r\n\r\nThe five-year-old son of the prosperous owner of the frame house and the\r\nolder boy had been playmates. The little boy, unaware of his comrade\'s\r\ndeparture, had stolen away, late in the afternoon, along the lonely\r\nstretch of wood road, and had reached the cabin only to find it empty.\r\nAs the dusk gathered, he grew afraid to start for home and crept\r\ntrembling into the cabin, whose door would not stay shut. Desperate with\r\nfear and loneliness, he lifted up his voice piteously. In the terrifying\r\nsilence, he listened hard to hear if anyone or anything were coming.\r\nThen again his shrill childish wailings arose, startling the unexpectant\r\nnight, and piercing the forest depths, even to the ears of two great\r\npanthers which had set forth to seek their meat from God.\r\n\r\nThe lonely cabin stood some distance, perhaps a quarter of a mile, back\r\nfrom the highway connecting the settlements. Along this main road a man\r\nwas plodding wearily. All day he had been walking, and now as he neared\r\nhome his steps began to quicken with anticipation of rest. Over his\r\nshoulder projected a double-barrelled fowling-piece, from which was\r\nslung a bundle of such necessities as he had purchased in town that\r\nmorning. It was the prosperous settler, the master of the frame house,\r\nwho had chosen to make the tedious journey on foot.\r\n\r\nHe passed the mouth of the wood road leading to the cabin and had gone\r\nperhaps a furlong beyond, when his ears were startled by the sound of a\r\nchild crying in the woods. He stopped, lowered his burden to the road,\r\nand stood straining ears and eyes in the direction of the sound. It was\r\njust at this time that the two panthers also stopped, and lifted their\r\nheads to listen. Their ears were keener than those of the man, and the\r\nsound had reached them at a greater distance.\r\n\r\nPresently the settler realized whence the cries were coming. He called\r\nto mind the cabin; but he did not know the cabin\'s owner had departed.\r\nHe cherished a hearty contempt for the drunken squatter; and on the\r\ndrunken squatter\'s child he looked with small favour, especially as a\r\nplaymate for his own boy. Nevertheless he hesitated before resuming his\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n"Poor little fellow!" he muttered, half in wrath. "I reckon his precious\r\nfather\'s drunk down at \'the Corners,\' and him crying for loneliness!"\r\nThen he re-shouldered his burden and strode on doggedly.\r\n\r\nBut louder, shriller, more hopeless and more appealing, arose the\r\nchildish voice, and the settler paused again, irresolute, and with\r\ndeepening indignation. In his fancy he saw the steaming supper his wife\r\nwould have awaiting him. He loathed the thought of retracing his steps,\r\nand then stumbling a quarter of a mile through the stumps and bog of the\r\nwood road. He was foot-sore as well as hungry, and he cursed the\r\nvagabond squatter with serious emphasis; but in that wailing was a\r\nterror which would not let him go on. He thought of his own little one\r\nleft in such a position, and straightway his heart melted. He turned,\r\ndropped his bundle behind some bushes, grasped his gun, and made speed\r\nback for the cabin.\r\n\r\n"Who knows," he said to himself, "but that drunken idiot has left his\r\nyoungster without a bite to eat in the whole miserable shanty? Or maybe\r\nhe\'s locked out, and the poor little beggar\'s half scared to death.\r\n_Sounds_ as if he was scared;" and at this thought the settler quickened\r\nhis pace.\r\n\r\nAs the hungry panthers drew near the cabin, and the cries of the lonely\r\nchild grew clearer, they hastened their steps, and their eyes opened to\r\na wider circle, flaming with a greener fire. It would be thoughtless\r\nsuperstition to say the beasts were cruel. They were simply keen with\r\nhunger, and alive with the eager passion of the chase. They were not\r\nferocious with any anticipation of battle, for they knew the voice was\r\nthe voice of a child, and something in the voice told them the child was\r\nsolitary. Theirs was no hideous or unnatural rage, as it is the custom\r\nto describe it. They were but seeking with the strength, the cunning,\r\nthe deadly swiftness given them to that end, the food convenient for\r\nthem. On their success in accomplishing that for which nature had so\r\nexquisitely designed them, depended not only their own, but the lives of\r\ntheir blind and helpless young, now whimpering in the cave on the slope\r\nof the moon-lit ravine. They crept through a wet alder thicket, bounded\r\nlightly over the ragged brush fence, and paused to reconnoitre on the\r\nedge of the clearing, in the full glare of the moon. At the same moment,\r\nthe settler emerged from the darkness of the wood road on the opposite\r\nside of the clearing. He saw the two great beasts, heads down and snouts\r\nthrust forward, gliding toward the open cabin door.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments the child had been silent. Now his voice rose again in\r\npitiful appeal, a very ecstasy of loneliness and terror. There was a\r\nnote in the cry that shook the settler\'s soul. He had a vision of his\r\nown boy, at home with his mother, safe-guarded from even the thought of\r\nperil. And here was this little one left to the wild beasts! "Thank God!\r\nThank God I came!" murmured the settler, as he dropped on one knee to\r\ntake a surer aim. There was a loud report (not like the sharp crack of a\r\nrifle), and the female panther, shot through the loins, fell in a heap,\r\nsnarling furiously and striking with her fore-paws.\r\n\r\nThe male walked around her in fierce and anxious amazement. Presently,\r\nas the smoke lifted, he discerned the settler kneeling for a second\r\nshot. With a high screech of fury, the lithe brute sprang upon his\r\nenemy, taking a bullet full in his chest without seeming to know he was\r\nhit. Ere the man could slip in another cartridge the beast was upon him,\r\nbearing him to the ground and fixing keen fangs in his shoulder. Without\r\na word, the man set his strong fingers desperately into the brute\'s\r\nthroat, wrenched himself partly free, and was struggling to rise, when\r\nthe panther\'s body collapsed upon him all at once, a dead weight which\r\nhe easily flung aside. The bullet had done its work just in time.\r\n\r\nQuivering from the swift and dreadful contest, bleeding profusely from\r\nhis mangled shoulder, the settler stepped up to the cabin door and\r\npeered in. He heard sobs in the darkness.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be scared, sonny," he said, in a reassuring voice. "I\'m going to\r\ntake you home along with me. Poor little lad, _I\'ll_ look after you, if\r\nfolks that ought to don\'t."\r\n\r\nOut of the dark corner came a shout of delight, in a voice which made\r\nthe settler\'s heart stand still. "_Daddy_, Daddy," it said, "I _knew_\r\nyou\'d come. I was so frightened when it got dark!" And a little figure\r\nlaunched itself into the settler\'s arms, and clung to him trembling. The\r\nman sat down on the threshold and strained the child to his breast. He\r\nremembered how near he had been to disregarding the far-off cries, and\r\ngreat beads of sweat broke out upon his forehead.\r\n\r\nNot many weeks afterwards the settler was following the fresh trail of a\r\nbear which had killed his sheep. The trail led him at last along the\r\nslope of a deep ravine, from whose bottom came the brawl of a swollen\r\nand obstructed stream. In the ravine he found a shallow cave, behind a\r\ngreat white rock. The cave was plainly a wild beast\'s lair, and he\r\nentered circumspectly. There were bones scattered about, and on some dry\r\nherbage in the deepest corner of the den, he found the dead bodies of\r\ntwo small panther cubs.\r\n\r\nCHARLES G. D.

W. PROCTER: ("Barry Cornwall")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE DAFFYDOWNDILLY\r\n\r\n    "I slept, and dreamed that life was beauty;\r\n    I woke, and found that life was duty."\r\n\r\n\r\nDaffydowndilly was so called because in his nature he resembled a\r\nflower, and loved to do only what was beautiful and agreeable, and took\r\nno delight in labour of any kind. But while Daffydowndilly was yet a\r\nlittle boy, his mother sent him away from his pleasant home, and put him\r\nunder the care of a very strict schoolmaster, who went by the name of\r\nMr. Toil. Those who knew him best affirmed that this Mr. Toil was a\r\nvery worthy character; and that he had done more good, both to children\r\nand grown people, than anybody else in the world.\r\n\r\nCertainly he had lived long enough to do a great deal of good; for, if\r\nall stories be true, he had dwelt upon earth ever since Adam was driven\r\nfrom the garden of Eden.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mr. Toil had a severe and ugly countenance, especially for\r\nsuch little boys or big men as were inclined to be idle; his voice, too,\r\nwas harsh; and all his ways and customs seemed very disagreeable to our\r\nfriend Daffydowndilly. The whole day long this terrible schoolmaster sat\r\nat his desk overlooking the scholars, or stalked about the school-room\r\nwith a certain awful birch rod in his hand. Now came a rap over the\r\nshoulders of a boy whom Mr. Toil had caught at play; now he punished a\r\nwhole class who were behindhand with their lessons; and, in short,\r\nunless a lad chose to attend quietly and constantly to his book, he had\r\nno chance of enjoying a quiet moment in the school-room of Mr. Toil.\r\n\r\n"This will never do for me," thought Daffydowndilly.\r\n\r\nNow the whole of Daffydowndilly\'s life had hitherto been passed with his\r\ndear mother, who had a much sweeter face than old Mr. Toil, and who had\r\nalways been very indulgent to her little boy. No wonder, therefore, that\r\npoor Daffydowndilly found it a woeful change to be sent away from the\r\ngood lady\'s side and put under the care of this ugly-visaged\r\nschoolmaster, who never gave him any apples or cakes, and seemed to\r\nthink that little boys were created only to get lessons.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear it any longer," said Daffydowndilly to himself, when he\r\nhad been at school about a week. "I\'ll run away and try to find my dear\r\nmother; and, at any rate, I shall never find anybody half so\r\ndisagreeable as this old Mr. Toil!"\r\n\r\nSo the very next morning, off started poor Daffydowndilly, and began his\r\nrambles about the world, with only some bread and cheese for his\r\nbreakfast, and very little pocket-money to pay his expenses. But he had\r\ngone only a short distance when he overtook a man of grave and sedate\r\nappearance, who was trudging at a moderate pace along the road.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, my lad," said the stranger; and his voice seemed hard and\r\nsevere, but yet had a sort of kindness in it. "Whence do you come so\r\nearly, and whither are you going?"\r\n\r\nLittle Daffydowndilly was a boy of a very ingenuous disposition, and had\r\nnever been known to tell a lie in all his life. Nor did he tell one now.\r\nHe hesitated a moment or two, but finally confessed that he had run away\r\nfrom school, on account of his great dislike for Mr. Toil; and that he\r\nwas resolved to find some place in the world where he should never see\r\nor hear of the old schoolmaster again.\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well, my little friend!" answered the stranger. "Then we will\r\ngo together; for I, likewise, have had a good deal to do with Mr. Toil,\r\nand should be glad to find some place where he was never heard of."\r\n\r\nOur friend Daffydowndilly would have been better pleased with a\r\ncompanion of his own age, with whom he might have gathered flowers along\r\nthe road-side, or have chased butterflies, or have done many other\r\nthings to make the journey pleasant. But he had wisdom enough to\r\nunderstand that he should get along through the world much easier by\r\nhaving a man of experience to show him the way. So he accepted the\r\nstranger\'s proposal, and they walked on very sociably together.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far, when the road passed by a field where some\r\nhaymakers were at work, mowing down the tall grass and spreading it out\r\nin the sun to dry. Daffydowndilly was delighted with the sweet smell of\r\nthe new-mown grass, and thought how much pleasanter it must be to make\r\nhay in the sunshine under the blue sky, and with the birds singing\r\nsweetly in the neighbouring trees and bushes, than to be shut up in a\r\ndismal school-room, learning lessons all day long, and continually\r\nscolded by old Mr. Toil. But, in the midst of these thoughts, while he\r\nwas stopping to peep over the stone wall, he started back and caught\r\nhold of his companion\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Quick, quick!" cried he. "Let us run away, or he will catch us!"\r\n\r\n"Who will catch us?" asked the stranger.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Toil, the old schoolmaster!" answered Daffydowndilly. "Don\'t you\r\nsee him amongst the haymakers?"\r\n\r\nAnd Daffydowndilly pointed to an elderly man, who seemed to be the owner\r\nof the field, and the employer of the men at work there. He had stripped\r\noff his coat and waistcoat, and was busily at work in his shirt sleeves.\r\nThe drops of sweat stood upon his brow; but he gave himself not a\r\nmoment\'s rest, and kept crying out to the haymakers to make hay while\r\nthe sun shone. Now, strange to say, the figure and features of this old\r\nfarmer were precisely the same as those of old Mr. Toil, who, at that\r\nvery moment, must have been just entering his school-room.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be afraid," said the stranger. "This is not Mr. Toil, the\r\nschoolmaster, but a brother of his, who was bred a farmer; and the\r\npeople say he is the more disagreeable man of the two. However, he won\'t\r\ntrouble you unless you become a labourer on the farm."\r\n\r\nLittle Daffydowndilly believed what his companion said, but he was very\r\nglad, nevertheless, when they were out of sight of the old farmer, who\r\nbore such a singular resemblance to Mr. Toil. The two travellers had\r\ngone but little farther, when they came to a spot where some carpenters\r\nwere erecting a house. Daffydowndilly begged his companion to stop a\r\nmoment; for it was a very pretty sight to see how neatly the carpenters\r\ndid their work, with their broad-axes and saws, and planes, and hammers,\r\nshaping out the doors, and putting in the window-sashes, and nailing on\r\nthe clap-boards; and he could not help thinking that he should like to\r\ntake a broad-axe, a saw, a plane, and a hammer, and build a little house\r\nfor himself. And then, when he should have a house of his own, old Mr.\r\nToil would never dare to molest him.\r\n\r\nBut, just while he was delighting himself with this idea, little\r\nDaffydowndilly beheld something that made him catch hold of his\r\ncompanion\'s hand, all in a fright.\r\n\r\n"Make haste. Quick, quick!" cried he. "There he is again!" "Who?" asked\r\nthe stranger, very quietly.\r\n\r\n"Old Mr. Toil," said Daffydowndilly, trembling.\r\n\r\n"There! he that is overseeing the carpenters. \'Tis my old schoolmaster,\r\nas sure as I\'m alive!"\r\n\r\nThe stranger cast his eyes where Daffydowndilly pointed his finger; and\r\nhe saw an elderly man, with a carpenter\'s rule and compass in his hand.\r\nThis person went to and fro about the unfinished house, measuring pieces\r\nof timber and marking out the work that was to be done, and continually\r\nexhorting the other carpenters to be diligent. And wherever he turned\r\nhis hard and wrinkled visage, the men seemed to feel that they had a\r\ntask-master over them, and sawed, and hammered, and planed, as if for\r\ndear life.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! this is not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster," said the stranger. "It\r\nis another brother of his, who follows the trade of carpenter."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to hear it," quoth Daffydowndilly; "but if you please,\r\nsir, I should like to get out of his way as soon as possible."\r\n\r\nThen they went on a little farther, and soon heard the sound of a drum\r\nand fife. Daffydowndilly pricked up his ears at this, and besought his\r\ncompanion to hurry forward, that they might not miss seeing the\r\nsoldiers. Accordingly they made what haste they could, and soon met a\r\ncompany of soldiers gaily dressed, with beautiful feathers in their\r\ncaps, and bright muskets on their shoulders. In front marched two\r\ndrummers and two fifers, beating on their drums and making such lively\r\nmusic that little Daffydowndilly would gladly have followed them to the\r\nend of the world. And if he was only a soldier, then, he said to\r\nhimself, old Mr. Toil would never venture to look him in the face.\r\n\r\n"Quick step! Forward march!" shouted a gruff voice.\r\n\r\nLittle Daffydowndilly started, in great dismay; for this voice which had\r\nspoken to the soldiers sounded precisely the same as that which he had\r\nheard every day in Mr. Toil\'s school-room, out of Mr. Toil\'s own mouth.\r\nAnd, turning his eyes to the captain of the company, what should he see\r\nbut the very image of old Mr. Toil himself, with a smart cap and feather\r\non his head, a pair of gold epaulets on his shoulders, a laced coat on\r\nhis back, a purple sash round his waist, and a long sword, instead of a\r\nbirch rod, in his hand. And though he held his head so high, and\r\nstrutted like a turkey-cock, still he looked quite as ugly and\r\ndisagreeable as when he was hearing lessons in the school-room.\r\n\r\n"This is certainly old Mr. Toil," said Daffydowndilly, in a trembling\r\nvoice. "Let us run away for fear he should make us enlist in his\r\ncompany!"\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken again, my little friend," replied the stranger, very\r\ncomposedly. "This is not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster, but a brother of\r\nhis, who has served in the army all his life. People say he\'s a terribly\r\nsevere fellow; but you and I need not be afraid of him."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said little Daffydowndilly, "but if you please, sir, I\r\ndon\'t want to see the soldiers any more."\r\n\r\nSo the child and the stranger resumed their journey; and, by and by,\r\nthey came to a house by the road-side, where a number of people were\r\nmaking merry. Young men and rosy-cheeked girls, with smiles on their\r\nfaces, were dancing to the sound of a fiddle. It was the pleasantest\r\nsight that Daffydowndilly had yet met with, and it comforted him for all\r\nhis disappointments.\r\n\r\n"Oh, let us stop here," cried he to his companion; "for Mr. Toil will\r\nnever dare to show his face where there is a fiddler, and where people\r\nare dancing and making merry. We shall be quite safe here!"\r\n\r\nBut these last words died away upon Daffydowndilly\'s tongue; for,\r\nhappening to cast his eyes on the fiddler, whom should he behold again\r\nbut the likeness of Mr. Toil, holding a fiddle-bow instead of a birch\r\nrod, and flourishing it with as much ease and dexterity as if he had\r\nbeen a fiddler all his life! He had somewhat the air of a Frenchman, but\r\nstill looked exactly like the old schoolmaster; and Daffydowndilly even\r\nfancied that he nodded and winked at him, and made signs for him to join\r\nin the dance.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear me!" whispered he, turning pale, "it seems as if there was\r\nnobody but Mr. Toil in the world. Who could have thought of his playing\r\non a fiddle!"\r\n\r\n"This is not your old schoolmaster," observed the stranger, "but another\r\nbrother of his, who was bred in France, where he learned the profession\r\nof a fiddler. He is ashamed of his family, and generally calls himself\r\nMonsieur le Plaisir; but his real name is Toil, and those who have known\r\nhim best think him still more disagreeable than his brothers."\r\n\r\n"Oh, take me back!--take me back!" cried poor little Daffydowndilly,\r\nbursting into tears. "If there is nothing but Toil all the world over, I\r\nmay just as well go back to the school-house!"\r\n\r\n"Yonder it is,--there is the school-house!" said the stranger, for\r\nthough he and Daffydowndilly had taken a great many steps, they had\r\ntravelled in a circle instead of a straight line. "Come; we will go back\r\nto school together."\r\n\r\nThere was something in his companion\'s voice that little Daffydowndilly\r\nnow remembered, and it is strange that he had not remembered it sooner.\r\nLooking up into his face, behold! there again was the likeness of old\r\nMr. Toil; so that the poor child had been in company with Toil all day,\r\neven while he was doing his best to run away from him. Some people, to\r\nwhom I have told little Daffydowndilly\'s story, are of the opinion that\r\nold Mr. Toil was a magician, and possessed the power of multiplying\r\nhimself into as many shapes as he saw fit.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, little Daffydowndilly had learned a good lesson, and\r\nfrom that time forward was diligent at his task, because he knew that\r\ndiligence is not a whit more toilsome than sport or idleness. And when\r\nhe became better acquainted with Mr. Toil, he began to think that his\r\nways were not so very disagreeable, and that the old schoolmaster\'s\r\nsmile of approbation made his face almost as pleasant as even that of\r\nDaffydowndilly\'s mother.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL HAWTHORNE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SANDPIPER\r\n\r\n\r\n    Across the narrow beach we flit,\r\n      One little sandpiper and I;\r\n    And fast I gather, bit by bit,\r\n      The scattered driftwood bleached and dry.\r\n    The wild waves reach their hands for it,\r\n      The wild wind raves, the tide runs high,\r\n    As up and down the beach we flit,--\r\n      One little sandpiper and I.\r\n\r\n    Above our heads the sullen clouds\r\n      Scud black and swift across the sky:\r\n    Like silent ghosts in misty shrouds\r\n      Stand out the white lighthouses high.\r\n    Almost as far as eye can reach\r\n      I see the close-reefed vessels fly,\r\n    As fast we flit along the beach,--\r\n      One little sandpiper and I.\r\n\r\n    I watch him as he skims along,\r\n      Uttering his sweet and mournful cry;\r\n    He starts not at my fitful song,\r\n      Or flash of fluttering drapery;\r\n    He has no thought of any wrong,\r\n      He scans me with a fearless eye.\r\n    Stanch friends are we, well-tried and strong,\r\n      The little sandpiper and I.\r\n\r\n    Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night\r\n      When the loosed storm breaks furiously?\r\n    My driftwood-fire will burn so bright!\r\n      To what warm shelter canst thou fly?\r\n    I do not fear for thee, though wroth\r\n      The tempest rushes through the sky:\r\n    For are we not God\'s children both,\r\n      Thou, little sandpiper, and I?\r\n\r\nCELIA THAXTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM "THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT"\r\n\r\n\r\nBlessed are the poor in spirit: for their\'s is the kingdom of heaven.\r\nBlessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.

Neither shalt thou swear by thy\r\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.\r\n\r\nYe have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and\r\nhate thine enemy.

And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more\r\nthan others? do not even the publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect, even\r\nas your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\r\n\r\nST. MATTHEW, V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF SAINT CHRISTOPHER\r\n\r\n\r\n    For many a year Saint Christopher\r\n      Served God in many a land;\r\n    And master painters drew his face,\r\n      With loving heart and hand,\r\n    On altar fronts and churches\' walls;\r\n      And peasants used to say,--\r\n    To look on good Saint Christopher\r\n      Brought luck for all the day.\r\n\r\n    For many a year, in lowly hut,\r\n      The giant dwelt content\r\n    Upon the bank, and back and forth\r\n      Across the stream he went;\r\n    And on his giant shoulders bore\r\n      All travellers who came,\r\n    By night, by day, or rich or poor,\r\n      All in King Jesus\' name.\r\n\r\n    But much he doubted if the King\r\n      His work would note or know,\r\n    And often with a weary heart\r\n      He waded to and fro.\r\n    One night, as wrapped in sleep he lay,\r\n      He sudden heard a call,--\r\n    "O Christopher, come, carry me!"\r\n      He sprang, looked out, but all\r\n\r\n    Was dark and silent on the shore,\r\n      "It must be that I dreamed,"\r\n    He said, and laid him down again;\r\n      But instantly there seemed\r\n    Again the feeble, distant cry,--\r\n      "Oh, come and carry me!"\r\n    Again he sprang and looked: again\r\n      No living thing could see.\r\n\r\n    The third time came the plaintive voice,\r\n      Like infant\'s, soft and weak;\r\n    With lantern strode the giant forth,\r\n      More carefully to seek.\r\n    Down on the bank a little child\r\n      He found,--a piteous sight,--\r\n    Who weeping, earnestly implored\r\n      To cross that very night.\r\n\r\n    With gruff good will he picked him up,\r\n      And on his neck to ride\r\n    He tossed him, as men play with babes,\r\n      And plunged into the tide.\r\n    But as the water closed around\r\n      His knees, the infant\'s weight\r\n    Grew heavier, and heavier,\r\n      Until it was so great\r\n\r\n    The giant scarce could stand upright,\r\n      His staff shook in his hand,\r\n    His mighty knees bent under him,\r\n      He barely reached the land.\r\n    And, staggering, set the infant down,\r\n      And turned to scan his face;\r\n    When, lo! he saw a halo bright\r\n      Which lit up all the place.\r\n\r\n    Then Christopher fell down, afraid\r\n      At marvel of the thing,\r\n    And dreamed not that it was the face\r\n      Of Jesus Christ, his King.\r\n    Until the infant spoke, and said:\r\n      "O Christopher, behold!\r\n    I am the Lord whom thou hast served,\r\n      Rise up, be glad and bold!\r\n\r\n    "For I have seen and noted well,\r\n      Thy works of charity;\r\n    And that thou art my servant good\r\n      A token thou shalt see.\r\n    Plant firmly here upon this bank\r\n      Thy stalwart staff of pine,\r\n    And it shall blossom and bear fruit,\r\n      This very hour, in sign."\r\n\r\n    Then, vanishing, the infant smiled.\r\n      The giant, left alone,\r\n    Saw on the bank, with luscious dates,\r\n      His stout pine staff bent down.\r\n\r\n    I think the lesson is as good\r\n      To-day as it was then--\r\n    As good to us called Christians\r\n      As to the heathen men--\r\n    The lesson of Saint Christopher,\r\n      Who spent his strength for others,\r\n    And saved his soul by working hard\r\n      To help and save his brothers!\r\n\r\nHELEN HUNT JACKSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM TELL AND HIS SON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun already shone brightly as William Tell entered the town of\r\nAltorf, and he advanced at once to the public place, where the first\r\nobject that caught his eyes was a handsome cap, embroidered with gold,\r\nstuck upon the end of a long pole. Soldiers were walking around it in\r\nsilence, and the people of Altorf, as they passed, bowed their head to\r\nthe symbol of authority. The cap had been set up by Gessler, the\r\nAustrian commander, for the purpose of discovering those who were not\r\nsubmissive to the Austrian power, which had ruled the people of the\r\nSwiss Cantons for a long time with great severity. He suspected that the\r\npeople were about to break into rebellion, and with a view to learn who\r\nwere the most discontented, he had placed the ducal cap of Austria on\r\nthis pole, publicly proclaiming that every one passing near, or within\r\nsight of it, should bow before it, in proof of his homage to the duke.\r\n\r\nTell was much surprised at this new and strange attempt to humble the\r\npeople, and, leaning on his cross-bow, gazed scornfully on them and the\r\nsoldiers. Berenger, captain of the guard, at length observed this man,\r\nwho alone amidst the cringing crowd carried his head erect. He ordered\r\nhim to be seized and disarmed by the soldiers, and then conducted him to\r\nGessler, who put some questions to him, which he answered so haughtily\r\nthat Gessler was both surprised and angry. Suddenly, he was struck by\r\nthe likeness between him and the boy Walter Tell, whom he had seized and\r\nput in prison the previous day for uttering some seditious words; he\r\nimmediately asked his name, which he no sooner heard than he knew him to\r\nbe the archer so famous, as the best marksman in the Canton.\r\n\r\nGessler at once resolved to punish both father and son at the same time,\r\nby a method which was perhaps the most refined act of torture which man\r\never imagined. As soon, then, as the youth was brought out, the governor\r\nturned to Tell, and said: "I have often heard of thy great skill as an\r\narcher, and I now intend to put it to the proof. Thy son shall be placed\r\nat a distance of a hundred yards, with an apple on his head. If thou\r\nstrikest the apple with thy arrow, I will pardon you both; but if thou\r\nrefusest this trial, thy son shall die before thine eyes."\r\n\r\nTell implored Gessler to spare him so cruel a trial, in which he might\r\nperhaps kill his beloved boy with his own hand. The governor would not\r\nalter his purpose; so Tell at last agreed to shoot at the apple, as the\r\nonly chance of saving his son\'s life. Walter stood with his back to a\r\nlinden tree. Gessler, some distance behind, watched every motion. His\r\ncross-bow and one arrow were handed to Tell; he tried the point, broke\r\nthe weapon, and demanded his quiver. It was brought to him and emptied\r\nat his feet. He stooped down, and taking a long time to choose an arrow,\r\nhe managed to hide a second in his girdle.\r\n\r\nAfter being in doubt a long time, his whole soul beaming in his face,\r\nhis love for his son rendering him almost powerless, he at length roused\r\nhimself--drew the bow--aimed--shot--and the apple, struck to the core,\r\nwas carried away by the arrow.\r\n\r\nThe market-place of Altorf was filled by loud cheers. Walter flew to\r\nembrace his father, who, overcome by his emotion, fell fainting to the\r\nground, thus exposing the second arrow to view. Gessler stood over him,\r\nawaiting his recovery, which speedily taking place, Tell rose, and\r\nturned away from the governor with horror. The latter, however,\r\nscarcely yet believing his senses, thus addressed him: "Incomparable\r\narcher, I will keep my promise; but what needed you with that second\r\narrow which I see in your girdle?"\r\n\r\nTell replied: "It is the custom of the bowmen of Uri to have always one\r\narrow in reserve."\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay," said Gessler, "tell me thy real motive; and, whatever it may\r\nhave been, speak frankly, and thy life is spared."\r\n\r\n"The second shaft," replied Tell, "was to pierce thy heart, tyrant, if I\r\nhad chanced to harm my son."\r\n\r\nCHAMBER\'S "Tracts."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MIDSUMMER SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n    O, father\'s gone to market-town, he was up before the day,\r\n    And Jamie\'s after robins, and the man is making hay,\r\n    And whistling down the hollow goes the boy that minds the mill,\r\n    While mother from the kitchen door is calling with a will:\r\n      "Polly!--Polly!--The cows are in the corn!\r\n        O, where\'s Polly?"\r\n\r\n    From all the misty morning air there comes a summer sound--\r\n    A murmur as of waters from skies and trees and ground.\r\n    The birds they sing upon the wing, the pigeons bill and coo,\r\n    And over hill and hollow rings again the loud halloo:\r\n      "Polly!--Polly!--The cows are in the corn!\r\n        O, where\'s Polly?"\r\n\r\n    Above the trees the honey-bees swarm by with buzz and boom,\r\n    And in the field and garden a thousand blossoms bloom.\r\n    Within the farmer\'s meadow a brown-eyed daisy blows,\r\n    And down at the edge of the hollow a red and thorny rose.\r\n      But Polly!--Polly!--The cows are in the corn!\r\n        O, where\'s Polly?\r\n\r\n    How strange at such a time of day the mill should stop its clatter!\r\n    The farmer\'s wife is listening now and wonders what\'s the matter.\r\n    O, wild the birds are singing in the wood and on the hill,\r\n    While whistling up the hollow goes the boy that minds the mill.\r\n      But Polly!--Polly!--The cows are in the corn!\r\n        O, where\'s Polly?\r\n\r\nRICHARD WATSON GILDER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW\r\n\r\n\r\nOn every side death stared us in the face; no human skill could avert it\r\nany longer. We saw the moment approach when we must bid farewell to\r\nearth, yet without feeling that unutterable horror which must have been\r\nexperienced by the unhappy victims at Cawnpore. We were resolved rather\r\nto die than yield, and were fully persuaded that in twenty-four hours\r\nall would be over. The engineer had said so, and all knew the worst. We\r\nwomen strove to encourage each other, and to perform the light duties\r\nwhich had been assigned to us, such as conveying orders to the\r\nbatteries, and supplying the men with provisions, especially cups of\r\ncoffee, which we prepared day and night.\r\n\r\nI had gone out to try to make myself useful, in company with Jessie\r\nBrown, the wife of a corporal in my husband\'s regiment. Poor Jessie had\r\nbeen in a state of restless excitement all through the siege, and had\r\nfallen away visibly within the last few days. A constant fever consumed\r\nher, and her mind wandered occasionally, especially that day when the\r\nrecollections of home seemed powerfully present to her. At last,\r\novercome with fatigue, she lay down on the ground, wrapped up in her\r\nplaid. I sat beside her, promising to awaken her when, as she said, her\r\n"father should return from the ploughing."\r\n\r\nShe fell at length into a profound slumber, motionless and apparently\r\nbreathless, her head resting in my lap. I myself could no longer resist\r\nthe inclination to sleep, in spite of the continual roar of the cannon.\r\nSuddenly I was aroused by a wild, unearthly scream close to my ear; my\r\ncompanion stood upright beside me, her arms raised, and her head bent\r\nforward in the attitude of listening.\r\n\r\nA look of intense delight broke over her countenance. She grasped my\r\nhand, drew me toward her, and exclaimed: "Dinna ye hear it? dinna ye\r\nhear it? Aye. I\'m no dreaming: it\'s the slogan o\' the Highlanders!\r\nWe\'re saved! we\'re saved!" Then, flinging herself on her knees, she\r\nthanked God with passionate fervour.\r\n\r\nI felt utterly bewildered; my English ears heard only the roar of\r\nartillery, and I thought my poor Jessie was still raving, but she darted\r\nto the batteries, and I heard her cry incessantly to the men: "Courage!\r\ncourage! Hark to the slogan--to the Macgregor, the grandest of them a\'!\r\nHere\'s help at last!"\r\n\r\nTo describe the effect of these words upon the soldiers would be\r\nimpossible. For a moment they ceased firing, and every soul listened\r\nwith intense anxiety. Gradually, however, there arose a murmur of bitter\r\ndisappointment, and the wailing of the women, who had flocked to the\r\nspot, burst out anew as the colonel shook his head. Our dull Lowland\r\nears heard only the rattle of the musketry.\r\n\r\nA few moments more of this deathlike suspense, of this agonizing hope,\r\nand Jessie, who had again sunk on the ground, sprang to her feet, and\r\ncried in a voice so clear and piercing that it was heard along the whole\r\nline: "Will ye no believe it noo? The slogan has ceased, indeed, but the\r\nCampbells are comin\'! D\'ye hear? d\'ye hear?"\r\n\r\nAt that moment all seemed, indeed, to hear the voice of God in the\r\ndistance, when the pibroch of the Highlanders brought us tidings of\r\ndeliverance; for now there was no longer any doubt of the fact. That\r\nshrill, penetrating, ceaseless sound, which rose above all other sounds,\r\ncould come neither from the advance of the enemy nor from the work of\r\nthe sappers. No, it was, indeed, the blast of the Scottish bagpipes, now\r\nshrill and harsh, as threatening vengeance on the foe, then in softer\r\ntones, seeming to promise succour to their friends in need.\r\n\r\nNever, surely, was there such a scene as that which followed. Not a\r\nheart in the residency of Lucknow but bowed itself before God. All, by\r\none simultaneous impulse, fell upon their knees, and nothing was heard\r\nbut bursting sobs and the murmured voice of prayer. Then all arose, and\r\nthere rang out from a thousand lips a great shout of joy, which\r\nresounded far and wide, and lent new vigour to that blessed pibroch.\r\n\r\nTo our cheer of "God save the Queen," they replied by the well-known\r\nstrain that moves every Scot to tears, "Should auld acquaintance be\r\nforgot." After that, nothing else made any impression on me. I scarcely\r\nremember what followed. Jessie was presented to the general on his\r\nentrance into the fort, and at the officers\' banquet her health was\r\ndrunk by all present, while the pipers marched around the table, playing\r\nonce more the familiar air of "Auld Lang Syne."\r\n\r\n"Letter from an officer\'s wife."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SONG IN CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Give us a song!" the soldiers cried,\r\n      The outer trenches guarding,\r\n    When the heated guns of the camps allied\r\n      Grew weary of bombarding.\r\n\r\n    The dark Redan, in silent scoff,\r\n      Lay, grim and threatening, under;\r\n    And the tawny mound of the Malakoff\r\n      No longer belched its thunder.\r\n\r\n    There was a pause. A guardsman said:\r\n      "We storm the forts to-morrow;\r\n    Sing while we may, another day\r\n      Will bring enough of sorrow."\r\n\r\n    They lay along the battery\'s side,\r\n      Below the smoking cannon:\r\n    Brave hearts, from Severn and from Clyde,\r\n      And from the banks of Shannon.\r\n\r\n    They sang of love, and not of fame;\r\n      Forgot was Britain\'s glory:\r\n    Each heart recalled a different name,\r\n      But all sang "Annie Laurie."\r\n\r\n    Voice after voice caught up the song,\r\n      Until its tender passion\r\n    Rose like an anthem, rich and strong,--\r\n      Their battle-eve confession.\r\n\r\n    Dear girl, her name he dared not speak,\r\n      But, as the song grew louder,\r\n    Something upon the soldier\'s cheek\r\n      Washed off the stains of powder.\r\n\r\n    Beyond the darkening ocean burned\r\n      The bloody sunset\'s embers,\r\n    While the Crimean valleys learned\r\n      How English love remembers.\r\n\r\n    And once again a fire of hell\r\n      Rained on the Russian quarters,\r\n    With scream of shot, and burst of shell,\r\n      And bellowing of the mortars!\r\n\r\n    And Irish Nora\'s eyes are dim\r\n      For a singer, dumb and gory;\r\n    And English Mary mourns for him\r\n      Who sang of "Annie Laurie."\r\n\r\n    Sleep, soldiers! still in honoured rest\r\n      Your truth and valour wearing:\r\n    The bravest are the tenderest,--\r\n      The loving are the daring.\r\n\r\nBAYARD TAYLOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTERGLOW\r\n\r\n\r\n    After the clangour of battle\r\n    There comes a moment of rest,\r\n    And the simple hopes and the simple joys\r\n    And the simple thoughts are best.\r\n\r\n    After the victor\'s p\xc3\xa6an,\r\n    After the thunder of gun,\r\n    There comes a lull that must come to all\r\n    Before the set of the sun.\r\n\r\n    Then what is the happiest memory?\r\n    Is it the foe\'s defeat?\r\n    Is it the splendid praise of a world\r\n    That thunders by at your feet?\r\n\r\n    Nay, nay, to the life-worn spirit\r\n    The happiest thoughts are those\r\n    That carry us back to the simple joys\r\n    And the sweetness of life\'s repose.\r\n\r\n    A simple love and a simple trust\r\n    And a simple duty done,\r\n    Are truer torches to light to death\r\n    Than a whole world\'s victories won.\r\n\r\nWILFRED CAMPBELL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD AND SALADIN\r\n\r\n\r\nSaladin led the way to a splendid pavilion where was everything that\r\nroyal luxury could devise. De Vaux, who was in attendance, then removed\r\nthe long riding-cloak which Richard wore, and he stood before Saladin in\r\nthe close dress which showed to advantage the strength and symmetry of\r\nhis person, while it bore a strong contrast to the flowing robes which\r\ndisguised the thin frame of the Eastern monarch. It was Richard\'s\r\ntwo-handed sword that chiefly attracted the attention of the Saracen--a\r\nbroad straight blade, the seemingly unwieldy length of which extended\r\nwellnigh from the shoulder to the heel of the wearer.\r\n\r\n"Had I not," said Saladin, "seen this brand flaming in the front of\r\nbattle, like that of Azrael, I had scarce believed that human arm could\r\nwield it. Might I request to see the Melech Ric strike one blow with it\r\nin peace and in pure trial of strength?"\r\n\r\n"Willingly, noble Saladin," answered Richard; and looking around for\r\nsomething whereon to exercise his strength, he saw a steel mace, held by\r\none of the attendants, the handle being of the same metal, and about an\r\ninch and a half in diameter. This he placed on a block of wood.\r\n\r\nThe glittering broadsword, wielded by both his hands, rose aloft to the\r\nking\'s left shoulder, circled round his head, descended with the sway of\r\nsome terrific engine, and the bar of iron rolled on the ground in two\r\npieces, as a woodman would sever a sapling with a hedging-bill.\r\n\r\n"By the head of the Prophet, a most wonderful blow!" said the Soldan,\r\ncritically and accurately examining the iron bar which had been cut\r\nasunder; and the blade of the sword was so well tempered as to exhibit\r\nnot the least token of having suffered by the feat it had performed. He\r\nthen took the king\'s hand, and looking on the size and muscular strength\r\nwhich it exhibited, laughed as he placed it beside his own, so lank and\r\nthin, so inferior in brawn and sinew.\r\n\r\n"Ay, look well," said De Vaux in English, "it will be long ere your long\r\njackanape\'s fingers do such a feat with your fine gilded reaping-hook\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Silence, De Vaux," said Richard; "by Our Lady, he understands or\r\nguesses thy meaning--be not so broad, I pray thee."\r\n\r\nThe Soldan, indeed, presently said: "Something I would fain attempt,\r\nthough wherefore should the weak show their inferiority in presence of\r\nthe strong? Yet, each land hath its own exercises, and this may be new\r\nto the Melech Ric." So saying, he took from the floor a cushion of silk\r\nand down, and placed it upright on one end. "Can thy weapon, my brother,\r\nsever that cushion?" he said to King Richard.\r\n\r\n"No, surely," replied the king; "no sword on earth, were it the\r\nExcalibur of King Arthur, can cut that which opposes no steady\r\nresistance to the blow."\r\n\r\n"Mark, then," said Saladin; and tucking up the sleeve of his gown,\r\nshowed his arm, thin indeed and spare, but which constant exercise had\r\nhardened into a mass consisting of nought but bone, brawn, and sinew. He\r\nunsheathed his scimitar, a curved and narrow blade, which glittered not\r\nlike the swords of the Franks, but was, on the contrary, of a dull blue\r\ncolour, marked with ten millions of meandering lines, which showed how\r\nanxiously the metal had been welded by the armourer. Wielding this\r\nweapon, apparently so inefficient when compared to that of Richard, the\r\nSoldan stood resting his weight upon his left foot, which was slightly\r\nadvanced; he balanced himself a little as if to steady his aim, then,\r\nstepping at once forward, drew the scimitar across the cushion, applying\r\nthe edge so dexterously and with so little apparent effort, that the\r\ncushion seemed rather to fall asunder than to be divided by violence.\r\n\r\n"It is a juggler\'s trick," said De Vaux, darting forward and snatching\r\nup the portion of the cushion which had been cut off, as if to assure\r\nhimself of the reality of the feat; "there is gramarye in this."\r\n\r\nThe Soldan seemed to comprehend him, for he undid the sort of veil which\r\nhe had hitherto worn, laid it double along the edge of his sabre,\r\nextended the weapon edgeways in the air, and drawing it suddenly through\r\nthe veil, although it hung on the blade entirely loose, severed that\r\nalso into two parts, which floated to different sides of the tent,\r\nequally displaying the extreme temper and sharpness of the weapon and\r\nthe exquisite dexterity of him who used it.\r\n\r\n"Now, in good faith, my brother," said Richard, "thou art even matchless\r\nat the trick of the sword, and right perilous were it to meet thee.\r\nStill, however, I put some faith in a downright English blow, and what\r\nwe cannot do by sleight we eke out by strength. Nevertheless, in truth\r\nthou art as expert in inflicting wounds as my sage Hakim in curing them.\r\nI trust I shall see the learned leech; I have much to thank him for, and\r\nhad brought some small present."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Saladin exchanged his turban for a Tartar cap. He had no\r\nsooner done so, than De Vaux opened at once his extended mouth and his\r\nlarge round eyes, and Richard gazed with scarce less astonishment, while\r\nthe Soldan spoke in a grave and altered voice: "The sick man, sayeth the\r\npoet, while he is yet infirm, knoweth the physician by his step; but\r\nwhen he is recovered, he knoweth not even his face when he looks upon\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"A miracle!--a miracle!" exclaimed Richard.\r\n\r\n"Of Mahound\'s working, doubtless," said Thomas de Vaux.\r\n\r\n"That I should lose my learned Hakim," said Richard, "merely by absence\r\nof his cap and robe, and that I should find him again in my royal\r\nbrother Saladin!"\r\n\r\n"Such is oft the fashion of the world," answered the Soldan: "the\r\ntattered robe makes not always the dervish."\r\n\r\nSCOTT: "The Talisman."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND\'S DEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n      Son of the Ocean Isle!\r\n      Where sleep your mighty dead?\r\n    Show me what high and stately pile\r\n      Is reared o\'er Glory\'s bed.\r\n\r\n      Go, stranger! track the deep--\r\n      Free, free, the white sail spread!\r\n    Wave may not foam, nor wild wind sweep,\r\n      Where rest not England\'s dead.\r\n\r\n      On Egypt\'s burning plains,\r\n      By the pyramid o\'erswayed,\r\n    With fearful power the noonday reigns,\r\n      And the palm trees yield no shade;--\r\n\r\n      But let the angry sun\r\n      From heaven look fiercely red,\r\n    Unfelt by those whose task is done!--\r\n      There slumber England\'s dead.\r\n\r\n      The hurricane hath might\r\n      Along the Indian shore,\r\n    And far by Ganges\' banks at night,\r\n      Is heard the tiger\'s roar;--\r\n\r\n      But let the sound roll on!\r\n      It hath no tone of dread\r\n    For those that from their toils are gone,--\r\n      There slumber England\'s dead.\r\n\r\n      Loud rush the torrent-floods\r\n      The Western wilds among,\r\n    And free, in green Columbia\'s woods,\r\n      The hunter\'s bow is strung;--\r\n\r\n      But let the floods rush on!\r\n      Let the arrow\'s flight be sped!\r\n    Why should they reck whose task is done?--\r\n      There slumber England\'s dead.\r\n\r\n      The mountain-storms rise high\r\n      In the snowy Pyrenees,\r\n    And toss the pine-boughs through the sky\r\n      Like rose-leaves on the breeze;--\r\n\r\n      But let the storm rage on!\r\n      Let the fresh wreaths be shed!\r\n    For the Roncesvalles\' field is won,--\r\n      There slumber England\'s dead.\r\n\r\n      On the frozen deep\'s repose\r\n      \'Tis a dark and dreadful hour,\r\n    When round the ship the ice-fields close,\r\n      And the northern night-clouds lower;--\r\n\r\n      But let the ice drift on!\r\n      Let the cold-blue desert spread!\r\n    Their course with mast and flag is done,\r\n      Even there sleep England\'s dead.\r\n\r\n      The warlike of the isles,\r\n      The men of field and wave!\r\n    Are not the rocks their funeral piles,\r\n      The seas and shores their grave?\r\n\r\n      Go, stranger! track the deep--\r\n      Free, free the white sail spread!\r\n    Wave may not foam, nor wild wind sweep,\r\n      Where rest not England\'s dead.\r\n\r\nFELICIA HEMANS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOHENLINDEN\r\n\r\n\r\n    On Linden, when the sun was low,\r\n    All bloodless lay th\' untrodden snow,\r\n    And dark as winter was the flow\r\n      Of Iser, rolling rapidly.\r\n\r\n    But Linden saw another sight,\r\n    When the drum beat, at dead of night,\r\n    Commanding fires of death to light\r\n      The darkness of her scenery.\r\n\r\n    By torch and trumpet fast arrayed\r\n    Each horseman drew his battle-blade,\r\n    And furious every charger neighed,\r\n      To join the dreadful revelry.\r\n\r\n    Then shook the hills with thunder riven,\r\n    Then rushed the steed to battle driven,\r\n    And louder than the bolts of heaven,\r\n      Far flashed the red artillery.\r\n\r\n    But redder yet that light shall glow\r\n    On Linden\'s hills of stain\xc3\xa8d snow,\r\n    And bloodier yet the torrent flow\r\n      Of Iser, rolling rapidly.\r\n\r\n    \'Tis morn, but scarce yon level sun\r\n    Can pierce the war-clouds, rolling dun,\r\n    Where furious Frank, and fiery Hun,\r\n      Shout in their sulph\'rous canopy.\r\n\r\n    The combat deepens.

It was three hundred and sixty-five years old; but\r\nall this length of years had seemed to the tree scarcely more than so\r\nmany days appear to us men and women, boys and girls.\r\n\r\nA tree\'s life is not quite the same as a man\'s: we wake during the day,\r\nand sleep and dream during the night; but a tree wakes throughout three\r\nseasons of the year, and has no sleep till winter comes. The winter is\r\nits sleeping time--its night after the long day which we call spring,\r\nsummer, and autumn.\r\n\r\nIt was just at the holy Christmas-tide that the oak tree dreamed his\r\nmost beautiful dream. He seemed to hear the church-bells ringing all\r\naround, and to feel as if it were a mild, warm summer day. Fresh and\r\ngreen he reared his mighty crown on high, and the sunbeams played among\r\nhis leaves. As in a festive procession, all that the tree had beheld in\r\nhis life now passed by.\r\n\r\nKnights and ladies, with feathers in their caps and hawks perching on\r\ntheir wrists, rode gaily through the wood; dogs barked, and the huntsman\r\nsounded his bugle.\r\n\r\nThen came foreign soldiers in bright armour and gay vestments, bearing\r\nspurs and halberds, setting up their tents, and presently taking them\r\ndown again. Then watch-fires blazed up and bands of wild outlaws sang,\r\nrevelled, and slept under the tree\'s outstretched boughs; or happy\r\nlovers met in quiet moonlight and carved their initials on the grayish\r\nbark.\r\n\r\nAt one time a guitar and an \xc3\x86olian harp had been hung among the old\r\noak\'s boughs by merry travelling apprentices; now they hung there again,\r\nand the wind played sweetly with their strings.\r\n\r\nAnd now the dream changed. A new and stronger current of life flowed\r\nthrough him, down to his lowest roots, up to his highest twigs, even to\r\nthe very leaves. The tree felt in his roots that a warm life stirred in\r\nthe earth, and that he was growing taller and taller; his trunk shot up\r\nmore and more, his crown grew fuller; and still he soared and spread.\r\nHe felt that his power grew, too, and he longed to advance higher and\r\nhigher to the warm, bright sun.\r\n\r\nAlready he towered above the clouds, which drifted below him, now like a\r\ntroop of dark-plumaged birds of passage, now like flocks of large, white\r\nswans. The stars became visible by daylight, so large and bright, each\r\none sparkling like a mild, clear eye.\r\n\r\nIt was a blessed moment! and yet, in the height of his joy, the oak tree\r\nfelt a desire and longing that all the other trees, bushes, herbs, and\r\nflowers of the wood might be lifted up with him to share in his glory\r\nand gladness. He could not be fully blessed unless he might have all,\r\nsmall and great, blessed with him.\r\n\r\nThe tree\'s crown bowed itself as though it had missed something, and\r\nlooked backward. Then he felt the fragrance of honeysuckle and violets,\r\nand fancied he could hear the birds. And so it was! for now peeped forth\r\nthrough the clouds the green summits of the wood; the other trees below\r\nhad grown and lifted themselves up likewise; bushes and herbs shot high\r\ninto the air, some tearing themselves loose from their roots to mount\r\nthe faster.\r\n\r\nLike a flash of white lightning the birch, moving fastest of all, shot\r\nupward its slender stem. Even the feathery brown reeds had pierced their\r\nway through the clouds, and the birds sang and sang, and on the grass\r\nthat fluttered to and fro like a streaming ribbon perched the\r\ngrasshopper, while cockchafers hummed and bees buzzed. All was music and\r\ngladness.\r\n\r\n"But the little blue flower near the water--I want that, too," said the\r\noak; "and the bellflower, and the dear little daisy." "We are here! we\r\nare here!" chanted sweet low voices on all sides.\r\n\r\n"But the pretty anemones, and the bed of lilies of the valley, and all\r\nthe flowers that bloomed so long ago,--would that they were here!" "We\r\nare here! we are here!" was the answer, and it seemed to come from the\r\nair above, as if they had fled upward first.\r\n\r\n"Oh, this is too great happiness!" exclaimed the oak tree; and now he\r\nfelt that his own roots were loosening themselves from the earth. "This\r\nis best of all," he said. "Now no bounds shall detain me. I can soar to\r\nthe heights of light and glory, and I have all my dear ones with me."\r\n\r\nSuch was the oak tree\'s Christmas dream. And all the while a mighty\r\nstorm swept the sea and land; the ocean rolled his heavy billows on the\r\nshore, the tree cracked, and was rent and torn up by the roots at the\r\nvery moment when he dreamed that he was soaring to the skies.\r\n\r\nNext day the sea was calm again, and a large vessel that had weathered\r\nthe storm hoisted all its flags for Merry Christmas. "The tree is\r\ngone--the old oak tree, our beacon! How can its place ever be supplied?"\r\nsaid the crew. This was the tree\'s funeral eulogium, while the Christmas\r\nhymn re-echoed from the wood.\r\n\r\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\r\n(Adapted)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRAYER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day returns and brings us the petty round of irritating concerns and\r\nduties.

He was kept a\r\nclose prisoner for two years, pining and sickening in his loneliness;\r\nwhile, in the meantime, the war continued, and at last a victory so\r\ndecisive was gained by the Romans, that the people of Carthage were\r\ndiscouraged, and resolved to ask terms of peace. They thought that no\r\none would be so readily listened to at Rome as Regulus, and they\r\ntherefore sent him there with their envoys, having first made him swear\r\nthat he would come back to his prison, if there should neither be peace\r\nnor an exchange of prisoners. They little knew how much more a\r\ntrue-hearted Roman cared for his city than for himself--for his word\r\nthan for his life.\r\n\r\nWorn and dejected, the captive warrior came to the outside of the gates\r\nof his own city and there paused, refusing to enter. "I am no longer a\r\nRoman citizen," he said; "I am but the barbarian\'s slave, and the Senate\r\nmay not give audience to strangers within the walls."\r\n\r\nHis wife, Marcia, ran out to greet him, with his two sons, but he did\r\nnot look up, and received their caresses as one beneath their notice, as\r\na mere slave, and he continued, in spite of all entreaty, to remain\r\noutside the city, and would not even go to the little farm he had loved\r\nso well.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Senate, as he would not come in to them, came out to hold\r\ntheir meeting in the Campagna.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors spoke first; then Regulus, standing up, said, as one\r\nrepeating a task: "Conscript fathers, being a slave to the\r\nCarthaginians, I come on the part of my masters to treat with you\r\nconcerning peace and an exchange of prisoners." He then turned to go\r\naway with the ambassadors, as a stranger might not be present at the\r\ndeliberations of the Senate. His old friends pressed him to stay and\r\ngive his opinion as a senator, who had twice been consul; but he refused\r\nto degrade that dignity by claiming it, slave as he was. But, at the\r\ncommand of his Carthaginian masters, he remained, though not taking his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nThen he spoke. He told the senators to persevere in the war. He said he\r\nhad seen the distress of Carthage, and that a peace would be only to her\r\nadvantage, not to that of Rome, and therefore he strongly advised that\r\nthe war should continue. Then, as to the exchange of prisoners, the\r\nCarthaginian generals, who were in the hands of the Romans, were in full\r\nhealth and strength, whilst he himself was too much broken down to be\r\nfit for service again; and, indeed, he believed that his enemies had\r\ngiven him a slow poison, and that he could not live long. Thus he\r\ninsisted that no exchange of prisoners should be made.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful, even to Romans, to hear a man thus pleading against\r\nhimself; and their chief priest came forward and declared that, as his\r\noath had been wrested from him by force, he was not bound by it to\r\nreturn to his captivity. But Regulus was too noble to listen to this for\r\na moment. "Have you resolved to dishonour me?" he said. "I am not\r\nignorant that death and the extremest tortures are preparing for me; but\r\nwhat are these to the shame of an infamous action, or the wounds of a\r\nguilty mind? Slave as I am to Carthage, I have still the spirit of a\r\nRoman. I have sworn to return. It is my duty to go; let the gods take\r\ncare of the rest."\r\n\r\nThe Senate decided to follow the advice of Regulus, though they bitterly\r\nregretted his sacrifice. His wife wept and entreated in vain that they\r\nwould detain him--they could merely repeat their permission to him to\r\nremain; but nothing could prevail with him to break his word, and he\r\nturned back to the chains and death he expected, as calmly as if he had\r\nbeen returning to his home. This was in the year B.C. 249.\r\n\r\nCHARLOTTE M.

I tell thee, they are giants; and therefore if thou art\r\nafraid, go aside and say thy prayers, for I am resolved to engage in a\r\ndreadful unequal combat against them all." This said, he clapped spurs\r\nto his horse Rozinante, without giving ear to his squire Sancho, who\r\nbawled out to him, and assured him that they were windmills, and no\r\ngiants. But he was so fully possessed with a strong conceit of the\r\ncontrary, that he did not so much as hear his squire\'s outcry, nor was\r\nhe sensible of what they were, although he was already very near them;\r\nfar from that: "Stand, cowards," cried he, as loud as he could; "stand\r\nyour ground, ignoble creatures, and fly not basely from a single knight,\r\nwho dares encounter you all!"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the wind rising, the mill-sails began to move, which\r\nwhen Don Quixote spied, "Base miscreants," cried he, "though you move\r\nmore arms than the giant Briareus, you shall pay for your arrogance."\r\n\r\nHe most devoutly recommended himself to his Lady Dulcinea, imploring her\r\nassistance in this perilous adventure; and, so covering himself with his\r\nshield, and couching his lance, he rushed with Rozinante\'s utmost speed\r\nupon the first windmill he could come at, and running his lance into the\r\nsail, the wind whirled it about with such swiftness, that the rapidity\r\nof the motion presently broke the lance into shivers, and hurled away\r\nboth knight and horse along with it, till down he fell, rolling a good\r\nway off in the field.\r\n\r\nSancho Panza ran as fast as his ass could drive to help his master, whom\r\nhe found lying, and not able to stir, such a blow had he and Rozinante\r\nreceived. "Mercy o\' me!" cried Sancho, "did not I give your worship fair\r\nwarning? Did not I tell you they were windmills, and that nobody could\r\nthink otherwise, unless he had also windmills in his head!"\r\n\r\n"Peace, friend Sancho," replied Don Quixote: "there is nothing so\r\nsubject to the inconstancy of fortune as war. I am verily persuaded that\r\ncursed necromancer, Freston, who carried away my study and my books, has\r\ntransformed these giants into windmills to deprive me of the honour of\r\nthe victory; such is his inveterate malice against me; but in the end,\r\nall his pernicious wiles and stratagems shall prove ineffectual against\r\nthe prevailing edge of my sword."\r\n\r\n"Amen, say I," replied Sancho.\r\n\r\nAnd so heaving him up again upon his legs, once more the knight mounted\r\npoor Rozinante, that was half shoulder-slipped with his fall.\r\n\r\nThis adventure was the subject of their discourse, as they made the best\r\nof their way towards the pass of Lapice, for Don Quixote took that road,\r\nbelieving he could not miss of adventure in one so mightily frequented.\r\nHowever, the loss of his lance was no small affliction to him; and as he\r\nwas making his complaint about it to his squire, "I have read," said he,\r\n"friend Sancho, that a certain Spanish knight, having broken his sword\r\nin the heat of an engagement, pulled up by the roots a huge oak tree, or\r\nat least tore down a massy branch, and did such wonderful execution,\r\ncrushing and grinding so many Moors with it that day, that he won\r\nhimself and his posterity the surname of The Pounder, or Bruiser. I tell\r\nthee this, because I intend to tear up the next oak or holm tree we\r\nmeet; with the trunk whereof I hope to perform such wondrous deeds that\r\nthou wilt esteem thyself particularly happy in having had the honour to\r\nbehold them, and been the ocular witness of achievements which posterity\r\nwill scarce be able to believe."\r\n\r\n"Heaven grant you may," cried Sancho; "I believe it all, because your\r\nworship says it. But, an\'t please you, sit a little more upright in your\r\nsaddle; you ride sideling methinks; but that, I suppose, proceeds from\r\nyour being bruised by the fall."\r\n\r\n"It does so," replied Don Quixote; "and if I do not complain of the\r\npain, it is because a knight-errant must never complain of his wounds."\r\n\r\n"Then I have no more to say," quoth Sancho; "and yet Heaven knows my\r\nheart, I should be glad to hear your worship groan a little now and then\r\nwhen something ails you: for my part, I shall not fail to bemoan myself\r\nwhen I suffer the smallest pain, unless, indeed, it can be proved that\r\nthe rule of not complaining extends to the squires as well as knights."\r\n\r\nDon Quixote could not forbear smiling at the simplicity of his squire;\r\nand told him he gave him leave to complain not only when he pleased, but\r\nas much as he pleased, whether he had any cause or no; for he had never\r\nyet read anything to the contrary in any books of chivalry.\r\n\r\nCERVANTES: "The Adventures of Don Quixote."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF THE SWAN\'S NEST\r\n\r\n\r\n    Little Ellie sits alone\r\n      \'Mid the beeches of a meadow,\r\n        By a stream-side on the grass,\r\n    And the trees are showering down\r\n      Doubles of their leaves in shadow,\r\n        On her shining hair and face.\r\n\r\n    She has thrown her bonnet by,\r\n      And her feet she has been dipping\r\n        In the shallow water\'s flow.\r\n    Now she holds them nakedly\r\n      In her hands, all sleek and dripping,\r\n        While she rocketh to and fro.\r\n\r\n    Little Ellie sits alone,\r\n      And the smile she softly uses,\r\n        Fills the silence like a speech,\r\n    While she thinks what shall be done,--\r\n      And the sweetest pleasure chooses\r\n        For her future within reach.\r\n\r\n    Little Ellie in her smile\r\n      Chooses ...

One moonlight winter\'s evening I called upon\r\nBeethoven; for I wished him to take a walk, and afterwards sup with me.\r\nIn passing through a dark, narrow street, he suddenly paused. "Hush!" he\r\nsaid, "what sound is that? It is from my Sonata in F. Hark! how well it\r\nis played!"\r\n\r\nIt was a little, mean dwelling, and we paused outside and listened. The\r\nplayer went on; but, in the midst of the finale, there was a sudden\r\nbreak; then the voice of sobbing: "I cannot play any more. It is too\r\nbeautiful; it is utterly beyond my power to do it justice. Oh! what\r\nwould I not give to go to the concert at Cologne!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! my sister," said her companion; "why create regrets when there is\r\nno remedy? We can scarcely pay our rent."\r\n\r\n"You are right, and yet I wish for once in my life to hear some really\r\ngood music. But it is of no use."\r\n\r\nBeethoven looked at me. "Let us go in," he said.\r\n\r\n"Go in!" I exclaimed. "What can we go in for?"\r\n\r\n"I will play to her," he said, in an excited tone. "Here is\r\nfeeling--genius--understanding! I will play to her, and she will\r\nunderstand it."\r\n\r\nAnd before I could prevent him his hand was upon the door. It opened and\r\nwe entered.\r\n\r\nA pale young man was sitting by the table, making shoes, and near him,\r\nleaning sorrowfully upon an old-fashioned piano, sat a young girl, with\r\na profusion of light hair falling over her face.\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," said Beethoven, "but I heard music and was tempted to\r\nenter. I am a musician."\r\n\r\nThe girl blushed, and the young man looked grave and somewhat annoyed.\r\n\r\n"I--I also overheard something of what you said," continued my friend.\r\n"You wish to hear--that is, you would like--that is--shall I play for\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nThere was something so odd in the whole affair, and something so comical\r\nand pleasant in the manner of the speaker, that the spell was broken in\r\na moment.\r\n\r\n"Thank you!" said the shoemaker; "but our piano is so wretched, and we\r\nhave no music."\r\n\r\n"No music!" echoed my friend; "how, then, does the young lady--" he\r\npaused and coloured; for, as he looked in the girl\'s face, he saw that\r\nshe was blind. "I--I entreat your pardon," he stammered. "I had not\r\nperceived before. Then you play by ear? But when do you hear the music,\r\nsince you frequent no concerts?"\r\n\r\n"We lived at Bruhl for two years, and while there I used to hear a lady\r\npractising near us. During the summer evenings her windows were\r\ngenerally open, and I walked to and fro outside to listen to her."\r\n\r\nShe seemed so shy that Beethoven said no more, but seated himself\r\nquietly before the piano and began to play. He had no sooner struck the\r\nfirst chord than I knew what would follow. Never, during all the years I\r\nknew him, did I hear him play as he then played to that blind girl and\r\nher brother. He seemed to be inspired; and, from the instant that his\r\nfingers began to wander along the keys, the very tones of the\r\ninstrument seemed to grow sweeter and more equal.\r\n\r\nThe brother and sister were silent with wonder and rapture. The former\r\nlaid aside his work; the latter, with her head bent slightly forward,\r\nand her hands pressed tightly over her breast, crouched down near the\r\nend of the piano, as if fearful lest even the beating of her heart\r\nshould break the flow of those magical sounds.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the flame of the single candle wavered, sank, flickered, and\r\nwent out. Beethoven paused, and I threw open the shutters, admitting a\r\nflood of brilliant moonlight. The room was almost as light as before,\r\nthe moon rays falling strongest upon the piano and the player. His head\r\ndropped upon his breast; his hands rested upon his knees; he seemed\r\nabsorbed in deep thought. He remained thus for some time. At length the\r\nyoung shoemaker arose and approached him eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Wonderful man!" he said, in a low tone. "Who and what are you?"\r\n\r\n"Listen!" said Beethoven, and he played the opening bars of the Sonata\r\nin F. A cry of recognition burst from them both, and exclaiming: "Then\r\nyou are Beethoven!" they covered his hands with tears and kisses.\r\n\r\nHe rose to go, but we held him back with entreaties.\r\n\r\n"Play to us once more--only once more!"\r\n\r\nHe suffered himself to be led back to the instrument. The moon shone\r\nbrightly in through the window, and lighted up his glorious, rugged head\r\nand massive figure.\r\n\r\n"I will improvise a Sonata to the Moonlight!" said he, looking up\r\nthoughtfully to the sky and stars. Then his hands dropped on the keys,\r\nand he began playing a sad and infinitely lovely movement, which crept\r\ngently over the instrument, like the calm flow of moonlight over the\r\ndark earth. This was followed by a wild, elfin passage in triple time--a\r\nsort of grotesque interlude, like the dance of spirits upon the lawn.\r\nThen came a swift agitato finale--a breathless, hurrying, trembling\r\nmovement, descriptive of flight, and uncertainty, and vague impulsive\r\nterror, which carried us away on its rustling wings, and left us all in\r\nemotion and wonder.\r\n\r\n"Farewell to you!" said Beethoven, pushing back his chair, and turning\r\ntowards the door--"farewell to you!"\r\n\r\n"You will come again?" asked they in one breath.\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked compassionately, almost tenderly, at the face of\r\nthe blind girl.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," he said hurriedly, "I will come again, and give the young\r\nlady some lessons! Farewell! I will come again!"\r\n\r\nTheir looks followed us in silence more eloquent than words till we were\r\nout of sight.\r\n\r\n"Let us make haste back," said Beethoven, "that I may write out that\r\nSonata while I can yet remember it."\r\n\r\nWe did so, and he sat over it till long past day dawn. And this was the\r\norigin of the Moonlight Sonata with which we are all so fondly\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nUNKNOWN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD\r\n\r\n\r\n    Black beneath as the night,\r\n      With wings of a morning glow,\r\n    From his sooty throat three syllables float,\r\n      Ravishing, liquid, low;\r\n    And \'tis oh, for the joy of June,\r\n      And the bliss that ne\'er can flee\r\n    From that exquisite call, with its sweet, sweet fall--\r\n      O-ke-lee, o-ke-lee, o-ke-lee!\r\n\r\n    Long ago as a child,\r\n      From the bough of a blossoming quince,\r\n    That melody came to thrill my frame,\r\n      And whenever I\'ve caught it since,\r\n    The spring-soft blue of the sky\r\n      And the spring-bright bloom of the tree\r\n    Are a part of the strain--ah, hear it again!--\r\n      O-ke-lee, o-ke-lee, o-ke-lee!\r\n\r\n    And the night is tenderly black,\r\n      The morning eagerly bright,\r\n    For that old, old spring is blossoming\r\n      In the soul and in the sight.\r\n    The red-winged blackbird brings\r\n      My lost youth back to me,\r\n    When I hear in the swale, from a gray fence rail,\r\n      O-ke-lee, o-ke-lee, o-ke-lee!\r\n\r\nETHELWYN WETHERALD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CUCKOO\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hail, beauteous stranger of the grove!\r\n      Thou messenger of spring!\r\n    Now Heaven repairs thy rural seat,\r\n      And woods thy welcome sing.\r\n\r\n    What time the daisy decks the green,\r\n      Thy certain voice we hear.\r\n    Hast thou a star to guide thy path,\r\n      Or mark the rolling year?\r\n\r\n    Delightful visitant! with thee\r\n      I hail the time of flowers,\r\n    And hear the sound of music sweet\r\n      From birds among the bowers.\r\n\r\n    The school-boy, wandering through the wood\r\n      To pull the primrose gay,\r\n    Starts, the new voice of Spring to hear,\r\n      And imitates thy lay.\r\n\r\n    What time the pea puts on the bloom,\r\n      Thou fliest thy vocal vale,\r\n    An annual guest in other lands,\r\n      Another spring to hail.\r\n\r\n    Sweet bird! thy bower is ever green,\r\n      Thy sky is ever clear;\r\n    Thou hast no sorrow in thy song,\r\n      No winter in thy year!\r\n\r\n    Oh, could I fly, I\'d fly with thee!\r\n      We\'d make, with joyful wing,\r\n    Our annual visit o\'er the globe,\r\n      Companions of the Spring.\r\n\r\nJOHN LOGAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A STONE\r\n\r\n\r\nA great many years ago, when nearly the whole of Canada was covered with\r\nwater, and the Northern Ocean, which washed the highest crests of the\r\nAlleghanies, made an island of the Laurentian Hills, and wrote its name\r\non the Pictured Rocks of Lake Superior, there lived somewhere near\r\nToronto, in the Province of Ontario, a little animal called a Polyp. He\r\nwas a curious creature, very small, not unlike a flower in appearance, a\r\nplant-animal.\r\n\r\nOne day, the sun shone down into the water and set this little fellow\r\nfree from the egg in which he was confined. For a time he floated about\r\nnear the bottom of the ocean, but at last settled down on a bit of\r\nshell, and fastened himself to it. Then he made an opening in his upper\r\nside, formed for himself a mouth and stomach, thrust out a whole row of\r\nfeelers, and began catching whatever morsels of food came in his way. He\r\nhad a great many strange ways, but the strangest of all was his\r\ngathering little bits of limestone from the water and building them up\r\nround him, as a person does who builds a well.\r\n\r\nBut this little Favosite, for that was his name, became lonesome on the\r\nbottom of that old ocean; so one night, when he was fast asleep and\r\ndreaming as only a coral animal can dream, there sprouted out of his\r\nside another little Favosite, who very soon began to wall himself up as\r\nhis parent had done. From these, other little Favosites were formed,\r\ntill at last there were so many of them, and they were so crowded\r\ntogether, that, to economize the limestone they built with, they had to\r\nmake their cells six-sided, like those of a honey-comb: on this account\r\nthey are called Favosites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe colony thrived for a long time, and accumulated quite a stock of\r\nlimestone. But at last a change came: there was a great rush of muddy\r\nwater from the land, and all the Favosites died, leaving only a stony\r\nskeleton to prove that industrious Polyps had ever existed there.\r\n\r\nThis skeleton remained undisturbed for ages, until the earth began to\r\nrise inch by inch out of the water. Then our Favosites\' home rose above\r\nthe deep, and with it came all that was left of its old acquaintances\r\nthe Trilobites, who were the ancestors of our crabs and lobsters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trilobite]\r\n\r\nThen the first fishes made their appearance, great fierce-looking\r\nfellows like the gar pike of our lakes, but larger, and armed with\r\nscales as hard as the armour of a crocodile. Next came the sharks, as\r\nsavage and voracious as they now are, with teeth like knives. But the\r\ntime of these old fishes and of many more animals came and went, and\r\nstill the home of the Favosites lay in the ground.\r\n\r\nThen came the long, hot, damp epoch, when thick mists hung over the\r\nearth, and great ferns and rushes, as stout as an oak and as tall as a\r\nsteeple, grew in Nova Scotia, in Pennsylvania, and in other parts of\r\nAmerica where coal is now found. Huge reptiles, with enormous jaws and\r\nteeth like cross-cut saws, and smaller ones with wings like bats, next\r\nappeared and added to the strangeness of the scene.\r\n\r\nBut the reptiles died; the ferns and the rush-trees fell into their\r\nnative swamps, and were covered up and packed away under great layers of\r\nclay and sand brought down by the rivers, till at last they were turned\r\ninto coal, forming for us, what someone has called, beds of petrified\r\nsunshine. But all this while the skeleton of the Favosites lay\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nThen the mists cleared away as gradually as they had come, the sun shone\r\nout, the grass grew, and strange four-footed animals came and fed upon\r\nit. Among these were odd-looking little horses no bigger than foxes;\r\ngreat hairy monsters larger than elephants, with tremendous tusks; hogs\r\nwith snouts nearly as long as their bodies; and other strange creatures\r\nthat no man has ever seen alive. But still the house of the Favosites\r\nremained where it was.\r\n\r\nNext came the great winter, and it continued to snow till the mountains\r\nwere hidden. Then the snow was packed into ice, and Canada became one\r\nsolid glacier. This ice age continued for many thousands of years.\r\n\r\nAt last the ice began to melt, and the glacier came slowly down the\r\nslopes, tearing up rocks, little and big, and crushing and grinding and\r\ncarrying away everything in its course. It ploughed its way across\r\nOntario, and the skeleton of our Favosites was rooted out from the quiet\r\nplace where it had lain so long, and was caught up in a crevice of the\r\nice. The glacier slid along, melting all the while, and covering the\r\nland with clay, pebbles, and boulders. At last it stopped, and as it\r\ngradually melted away, all the rocks and stones and dirt it had carried\r\nwith it thus far, were deposited into one great heap, and the home of\r\nthe Favosites along with them.\r\n\r\nAges afterwards a farmer, near Toronto, when ploughing a field, picked\r\nup a curious bit of "petrified honey-comb," and gave it to a geologist\r\nto hear what he would say about it. And now you have read what he said.\r\n\r\nD. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SNOW-STORM\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sun that brief December day\r\n    Rose cheerless over hills of gray,\r\n    And, darkly circled, gave at noon\r\n    A sadder light than waning moon.\r\n    A chill no coat, however stout,\r\n    Of homespun stuff could quite shut out,\r\n    A hard, dull bitterness of cold,\r\n      That checked, mid-vein, the circling race\r\n      Of life-blood in the sharpened face,\r\n    The coming of the snow-storm told.\r\n    The wind blew east: we heard the roar\r\n    Of Ocean on his wintry shore,\r\n    And felt the strong pulse throbbing there\r\n    Beat with low rhythm our inland air.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile we did our nightly chores,--\r\n    Brought in the wood from out of doors,\r\n    Littered the stalls, and from the mows\r\n    Raked down the herd\'s-grass for the cows:\r\n    Heard the horse whinnying for his corn;\r\n    And, sharply clashing horn on horn,\r\n    Impatient down the stanchion rows\r\n    The cattle shake their walnut bows;\r\n    While, peering from his early perch\r\n    Upon the scaffold\'s pole of birch,\r\n    The cock his crested helmet bent\r\n    And down his querulous challenge sent.\r\n\r\n    Unwarmed by any sunset light\r\n    The gray day darkened into night,\r\n    A night made hoary with the swarm\r\n    And whirl-dance of the blinding storm,\r\n    As zigzag wavering to and fro\r\n    Crossed and recrossed the wing\xc3\xa8d snow:\r\n    And ere the early bed-time came\r\n    The white drift piled the window-frame,\r\n    And through the glass the clothes-line posts\r\n    Looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts.\r\n\r\n    So all night long the storm roared on:\r\n    The morning broke without a sun;\r\n    And, when the second morning shone,\r\n    We looked upon a world unknown,\r\n    On nothing we could call our own.\r\n    Around the glistening wonder bent\r\n    The blue walls of the firmament,\r\n    No cloud above, no earth below,--\r\n    A universe of sky and snow!\r\n    The old familiar sights of ours\r\n    Took marvellous shapes; strange domes and towers\r\n    Rose up where sty or corn-crib stood,\r\n    Or garden wall, or belt of wood;\r\n    A smooth white mound the brush-pile showed,\r\n    A fenceless drift what once was road;\r\n    The bridle-post an old man sat\r\n    With loose-flung coat and high cocked hat;\r\n    The well-curb had a Chinese roof;\r\n    And even the long sweep, high aloof,\r\n    In its slant splendour, seemed to tell\r\n    Of Pisa\'s leaning miracle.\r\n\r\n    A prompt, decisive man, no breath\r\n    Our father wasted: "Boys, a path!"\r\n    Well pleased, (for when did farmer boy\r\n    Count such a summons less than joy?)\r\n    Our buskins on our feet we drew;\r\n      With mittened hands, and caps drawn low\r\n      To guard our necks and ears from snow,\r\n    We cut the solid whiteness through.\r\n    And, where the drift was deepest made\r\n    A tunnel walled and overlaid\r\n    With dazzling crystal: we had read\r\n    Of rare Aladdin\'s wondrous cave,\r\n    And to our own his name we gave,\r\n    With many a wish the luck were ours\r\n    To test his lamp\'s supernal powers.\r\n    We reached the barn with merry din,\r\n    And roused the prisoned brutes within.\r\n\r\n    The old horse thrust his long head out,\r\n    And grave with wonder gazed about;\r\n    The cock his lusty greeting said,\r\n    And forth his speckled harem led;\r\n    The oxen lashed their tails, and hooked,\r\n    And mild reproach of hunger looked;\r\n    The horn\xc3\xa8d patriarch of the sheep,\r\n    Like Egypt\'s Amun roused from sleep,\r\n    Shook his sage head with gesture mute,\r\n    And emphasized with stamp of foot.\r\n\r\n    All day the gusty north wind bore\r\n    The loosening drift its breath before;\r\n    Low circling round its southern zone,\r\n    The sun through dazzling snow-mist shone.\r\n\r\nWHITTIER: "Snow-bound."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEROINE OF VERCH\xc3\x88RES\r\n\r\n\r\nVerch\xc3\xa8res was a fort on the south shore of the St. Lawrence, about\r\ntwenty miles below Montreal. A strong block-house stood outside the\r\nfort, and was connected with it by a covered way. On the morning of the\r\ntwenty-second of October, (1692) the inhabitants were at work in the\r\nfields, and nobody was left in the place but two soldiers, two boys, an\r\nold man of eighty, and a number of women and children. The commandant\r\nwas on duty at Quebec; his wife was at Montreal; and their daughter,\r\nMadeline, fourteen years of age, was at the landing-place not far from\r\nthe gate of the fort, with a man-servant.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she heard firing from the direction where the settlers were at\r\nwork, and an instant after the servant called out: "Run, miss!--run!\r\nhere come the Indians!" She turned and saw forty or fifty of them at the\r\ndistance of a pistol-shot. She ran to the fort as quickly as possible,\r\nwhile the bullets whistled about her ears, and made the time seem very\r\nlong. As soon as she was near enough to be heard, she cried out: "To\r\narms!--to arms!" hoping that somebody would come out and help her; but\r\nit was of no use. The two soldiers in the fort were so scared that they\r\nhad hidden in the block-house.\r\n\r\nWhen she had seen certain breaches in the palisade stopped, she went to\r\nthe block-house, where the ammunition was kept; and there she found the\r\ntwo soldiers, one hiding in a corner, and the other with a lighted match\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do with that match?" she asked. He answered:\r\n"Light the powder and blow us all up." "You are a miserable coward!"\r\nsaid she. "Go out of this place." She then threw off her bonnet, put on\r\na hat, and taking a gun in her hand she said to her two brothers: "Let\r\nus fight to the death. We are fighting for our country and our\r\nreligion."\r\n\r\nThe boys, who were ten and twelve years old, aided by the soldiers, whom\r\nher words had inspired with some little courage, began to fire from the\r\nloop-holes on the Indians, who, ignorant of the weakness of the\r\ngarrison, showed their usual reluctance to attack a fortified place, and\r\noccupied themselves with chasing and butchering the people in the\r\nneighbouring fields. Madeline ordered a cannon to be fired, partly to\r\ndeter the enemy from an assault, and partly to warn some of the soldiers\r\nwho were hunting at a distance.\r\n\r\nA canoe was presently seen approaching the landing-place. In it was a\r\nsettler named Fontaine, trying to reach the fort with his family. The\r\nIndians were still near; and Madeline feared that the new-comers would\r\nbe killed, if something were not done to aid them. Distrusting the\r\nsoldiers, she herself went alone to the landing-place.\r\n\r\n"I thought," she said, in her account of the affair, "that the savages\r\nwould suppose it to be a ruse to draw them towards the fort, in order\r\nto make a sortie upon them. They did suppose so; and thus I was able to\r\nsave the Fontaine family. When they were all landed, I made them march\r\nbefore me in full sight of the enemy. We put so bold a face on it, that\r\nthey thought they had more to fear than we. Strengthened by this\r\nreinforcement, I ordered that the enemy should be fired on whenever they\r\nshowed themselves.\r\n\r\n"After sunset a violent north-east wind began to blow, accompanied with\r\nsnow and hail, which told us that we should have a terrible night. The\r\nIndians were all this time lurking about us; and I judged by all their\r\nmovements that, instead of being deterred by the storm, they would climb\r\ninto the fort under cover of darkness."\r\n\r\nShe then assembled her troops, who numbered six, all told, and spoke to\r\nthem encouraging words. With two old men she took charge of the fort,\r\nand sent Fontaine and the two soldiers with the women and children to\r\nthe block-house. She placed her two brothers on two of the bastions, and\r\nan old man on a third, while she herself took charge of the fourth. All\r\nnight, in spite of wind, snow, and hail, the cry of "All\'s well" was\r\nkept up from the block-house to the fort, and from the fort to the\r\nblock-house. One would have supposed that the place was full of\r\nsoldiers. The Indians thought so, and were completely deceived, as they\r\nafterwards confessed.\r\n\r\nAt last the daylight came again; and as the darkness disappeared, the\r\nanxieties of the little garrison seemed to disappear with it. Fontaine\r\nsaid he would never abandon the place while Madeline remained in it. She\r\ndeclared that she would never abandon it: she would rather die than give\r\nit up to the enemy.\r\n\r\nShe did not eat or sleep for twice twenty-four hours. She did not go\r\nonce into her father\'s house, but kept always on the bastion, except\r\nwhen she went to the block-house to see how the people there were\r\nbehaving. She always kept a cheerful and smiling face, and encouraged\r\nher little company with the hope of speedy succour.\r\n\r\n"We were a week in constant alarm," she continues, "with the enemy\r\nalways about us. At last a lieutenant, sent by the governor, arrived in\r\nthe night with forty men. As he did not know whether the fort was taken\r\nor not, he approached as silently as possible. One of our sentinels,\r\nhearing a slight sound, cried: \'Who goes there?\' I was at the time\r\ndozing, with my head on a table and my gun lying across my arms. The\r\nsentinel told me that he heard voices from the river. I went at once to\r\nthe bastion to see whether they were Indians or Frenchmen who were\r\nthere. I asked: \'Who are you?\' One of them answered: \'We are Frenchmen\r\ncome to bring you help.\'"\r\n\r\n"I caused the gate to be opened, placed a sentinel there, and went down\r\nto the river to meet them. As soon as I saw the lieutenant I saluted\r\nhim, and said: \'I surrender my arms to you.\' He answered gallantly:\r\n\'They are in good hands, Miss.\' He inspected the fort, and found\r\neverything in order, and a sentinel on each bastion. \'It is time to\r\nrelieve them,\' said I; \'we have not been off our bastions for a week.\'"\r\n\r\nA band of converts from St. Louis arrived soon afterwards, followed the\r\ntrail of their heathen countrymen, overtook them on Lake Champlain, and\r\nrecovered twenty or more French prisoners.\r\n\r\nPARKMAN: "Frontenac and New France."\r\n(Adapted)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJACQUES CARTIER\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the seaport of St. Malo, \'twas a smiling morn in May,\r\n    When the Commodore Jacques Cartier to the westward sailed away;\r\n    In the crowded old Cathedral, all the town were on their knees,\r\n    For the safe return of kinsmen from the undiscovered seas;\r\n    And every autumn blast that swept o\'er pinnacle and pier,\r\n    Filled manly hearts with sorrow, and gentle hearts with fear.\r\n\r\n    A year passed o\'er St. Malo--again came round the day,\r\n    When the Commodore Jacques Cartier to the westward sailed away;\r\n    But no tidings from the absent had come the way they went,\r\n    And tearful were the vigils that many a maiden spent;\r\n    And manly hearts were filled with gloom, and gentle hearts with fear,\r\n    When no tidings came from Cartier at the closing of the year.\r\n\r\n    But the earth is as the Future, it hath its hidden side,\r\n    And the Captain of St. Malo was rejoicing in his pride;\r\n    In the forests of the North--while his townsmen mourned his loss--\r\n    He was rearing on Mount Royal the _fleur-de-lis_ and cross;\r\n    And when two months were over, and added to the year,\r\n    St. Malo hailed him home again, cheer answering to cheer.\r\n\r\n    He told them of a region, hard, iron-bound and cold,\r\n    Nor seas of pearl abounded, nor mines of shining gold;\r\n    Where the wind from Thule freezes the word upon the lip,\r\n    And the ice in spring comes sailing athwart the early ship;\r\n    He told them of the frozen scene, until they thrilled with fear,\r\n    And piled fresh fuel on the hearth to make them better cheer.\r\n\r\n    But when he changed the strain,--he told how soon is cast\r\n    In early Spring, the fetters that hold the waters fast;\r\n    How the Winter causeway, broken, is drifted out to sea,\r\n    And the rills and rivers sing with pride the anthem of the free;\r\n    How the magic wand of Summer clad the landscape to his eyes,\r\n    Like the dry bones of the just when they wake in Paradise.\r\n\r\n    He told them of the Algonquin braves--the hunters of the wild;\r\n    Of how the Indian mother in the forest rocks her child;\r\n    Of how, poor souls, they fancy in every living thing\r\n    A spirit good or evil, that claims their worshipping;\r\n    Of how they brought their sick and maimed for him to breathe upon;\r\n    And of the wonders wrought for them, thro\' the Gospel of St. John.\r\n\r\n    He told them of the river, whose mighty current gave\r\n    Its freshness for a hundred leagues to ocean\'s briny wave;\r\n    He told them of the glorious scene presented to his sight,\r\n    What time he reared the cross and crown on Hochelaga\'s height;\r\n    And of the fortress cliff, that keeps of Canada the key;--\r\n    And they welcomed back Jacques Cartier from perils over sea.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS D\'ARCY M\'GEE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTS AND THEIR SLAVES\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Huber, the son of the noted observer of the ways and habits of\r\nbees, was walking one day in a field near Geneva, Switzerland, when he\r\nsaw on the ground an army of reddish-coloured ants on the march. He\r\ndecided to follow them and to find out, if possible, the object of their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nOn the sides of the column, as if to keep it in order, a few of the\r\ninsects sped to and fro. After marching for about a quarter of an hour,\r\nthe army halted before an ant-hill, the home of a colony of small, black\r\nants. These swarmed out to meet the red ones, and, to Huber\'s surprise,\r\na combat, short but fierce, took place at the foot of the hill.\r\n\r\nA small number of the blacks fought bravely to the last, but the rest\r\nsoon fled, panic-stricken, through the gates farthest from the\r\nbattle-field, carrying away some of their young. They seemed to know it\r\nwas the young ants that the invaders were seeking. The red warriors\r\nquickly forced their way into the tiny city and returned, loaded with\r\nchildren of the blacks.\r\n\r\nCarrying their living booty, the kidnappers left the pillaged town and\r\nstarted toward their home, whither Huber followed them. Great was his\r\nastonishment when, at the threshold of the red ants\' dwelling, he saw\r\nnumbers of black ants come forward to receive the young captives and to\r\nwelcome them--children of their own race, doomed to be bond-servants in\r\na strange land.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a miniature city, in which strong red ants lived in\r\npeace with small black ones. But what was the province of the latter?\r\nHuber soon discovered that, in fact, these did all the work. They alone\r\nwere able to build the houses in which both races lived; they alone\r\nbrought up the young red ants and the captives of their own species;\r\nthey alone gathered the supplies of food, and waited upon and fed their\r\nbig masters, who were glad to have their little waiters feed them so\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\nThe masters themselves had no occupation except that of war. When not\r\nraiding some village of the blacks, the red soldiers did nothing but\r\nwander lazily about.\r\n\r\nHuber wanted to learn what would be the result if the red ants found\r\nthemselves without servants. Would the big creatures know how to supply\r\ntheir own needs? He put a few of the red insects in a glass case, having\r\nsome honey in a corner. They did not go near it. They did not know\r\nenough to feed themselves. Some of them died of starvation, with food\r\nbefore them. Then he put into the case one black ant. It went straight\r\nto the honey, and with it fed its big, starving, silly masters. Here was\r\na wonder, truly!\r\n\r\nThe little blacks exert in many things a moral force whose signs are\r\nplainly visible. For example, those tiny wise creatures will not give\r\npermission to any of the great red ones to go out alone. Nor are these\r\nat liberty to go out even in a body, if their small helpers fear a\r\nstorm, or if the day is far advanced. When a raid proves fruitless, the\r\nsoldiers coming back without any living booty are forbidden by the\r\nblacks to enter the city, and are ordered to attack some other village.\r\n\r\nNot wishing to rely entirely on his own conclusions, Huber asked one of\r\nthe great naturalists of Switzerland, Jurine, to decide whether or not\r\nmistakes had been made regarding these customs of the ants. This\r\nwitness, and indeed others, found that Huber\'s reports were true.\r\n\r\n"Yet, after all," says Huber, "I still doubted. But on a later day I\r\nagain saw in the park of Fontainebleau, near Paris, the same workings of\r\nant life and wisdom. A well-known naturalist was with me then, and his\r\nconclusions were the same as mine.\r\n\r\n"It was half-past four in the afternoon of a very warm day. From a pile\r\nof stones there came forth a column of about five hundred reddish ants.\r\nThey marched rapidly toward a field of turf, order in their ranks being\r\nkept by their sergeants. These watched the flanks, and would not permit\r\nany to straggle.\r\n\r\n"Suddenly the army disappeared. There was no sign of an ant-hill in the\r\nturf, but, after awhile, we detected a little hole. Through this the\r\nants had vanished. We supposed it was an entrance to their home. In a\r\nminute they showed us that our supposition was incorrect. They issued in\r\na throng, nearly every one of them carrying a small black captive.\r\n\r\n"From the short time they had taken, it was plain that they knew the\r\nplace and the weakness of its citizens. Perhaps it was not the reds\'\r\nfirst attack on this city of the little blacks. These swarmed out in\r\ngreat numbers; and, truly, I pitied them. They did not attempt to fight.\r\nThey seemed terror-stricken, and made no attempt to oppose the warrior\r\nants, except by clinging to them. One of the marauders was stopped thus,\r\nbut a comrade that was free relieved him of his burden, and thereupon\r\nthe black ant let go his grasp.\r\n\r\n"It was in fact a painful sight. The soldiers succeeded in carrying off\r\nnearly five hundred children. About three feet from the entrance to the\r\nant-hill the plundered black parents ceased to follow the red robbers,\r\nand resigned themselves to the loss of their young. The whole raid did\r\nnot occupy more than ten minutes.\r\n\r\n"The parties were, as we have seen, very unequal in strength, and the\r\nattack was clearly an outrage--an outrage no doubt often repeated. The\r\nbig red ants, knowing their power, played the part of tyrants; and,\r\nwhenever they wanted more slaves, despoiled the small weak blacks of\r\ntheir greatest treasures--their children."\r\n\r\nMICHELET\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAD, KINDLY LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lead, kindly Light, amid th\' encircling gloom,\r\n                Lead Thou me on;\r\n    The night is dark, and I am far from home,\r\n                Lead Thou me on.\r\n    Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see\r\n    The distant scene; one step enough for me.\r\n\r\n    I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou\r\n                Shouldst lead me on;\r\n    I loved to choose and see my path; but now\r\n                Lead Thou me on.\r\n    I loved the garish day; and, spite of fears,\r\n    Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.\r\n\r\n    So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still\r\n                Will lead me on\r\n    O\'er moor and fen, o\'er crag and torrent, till\r\n                The night is gone,\r\n    And with the morn those angel faces smile,\r\n    Which I have loved long since, and lost a while.\r\n\r\nNEWMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JOLLY SANDBOYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jolly Sandboys was a small road-side inn with a sign, representing\r\nthree Sandboys, creaking and swinging on its post on the opposite side\r\nof the road. As the travellers had observed many indications of their\r\ndrawing nearer to the race town, such as gypsy camps, showmen of various\r\nkinds, and beggars and trampers of every degree, Mr. Codlin was fearful\r\nof finding the accommodation forestalled; but had the gratification of\r\nfinding that his fears were without foundation, for the landlord was\r\nleaning against the door-post, looking lazily at the rain which had\r\nbegun to descend heavily.\r\n\r\n"Make haste in out of the wet, Tom," said the landlord; "when it came on\r\nto rain I told \'em to make the fire up, and there\'s a glorious blaze in\r\nthe kitchen, I can tell you."\r\n\r\nMr. Codlin followed with a willing mind. A mighty fire was blazing on\r\nthe hearth and roaring up the wide chimney with a cheerful sound, which\r\na large iron cauldron, bubbling and simmering in the heat, lent its\r\npleasant aid to swell. There was a deep red ruddy blush upon the room,\r\nand when the landlord stirred the fire, sending the flame skipping and\r\nleaping up--when he took off the lid of the iron pot and there rushed\r\nout a savoury smell, while the bubbling sound grew deeper and more rich,\r\nand an unctuous steam came floating out, hanging in a delicious mist\r\nabove their heads--when he did this, Mr. Codlin\'s heart was touched.\r\n\r\nHe sat down in the chimney-corner and smiled.\r\n\r\nMr. Codlin sat smiling in the chimney-corner, eyeing the landlord as\r\nwith a roguish look he held the cover in his hand, and feigning that his\r\ndoing so was needful to the welfare of the cookery, suffered the\r\ndelightful steam to tickle the nostrils of his guest. The glow of the\r\nfire was upon the landlord\'s bald head, and upon his twinkling eye, and\r\nupon his watering mouth, and upon his pimpled face, and upon his round\r\nfat figure. Mr. Codlin drew his sleeve across his lips, and said in a\r\nmurmuring voice: "What is it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a stew of tripe," said the landlord, smacking his lips, "and\r\ncow-heel," smacking them again, "and bacon," smacking them once more,\r\n"and steak," smacking them for the fourth time, "and peas, cauliflowers,\r\nnew potatoes, and sparrow-grass, all working up together in one\r\ndelicious gravy." Having come to the climax, he smacked his lips a great\r\nmany times, and taking a long, hearty sniff of the fragrance that was\r\nhovering about, put on the cover again with the air of one whose toils\r\non earth were over.\r\n\r\n"At what time will it be ready?" asked Mr. Codlin, faintly.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be done to a turn," said the landlord looking up to the\r\nclock--and the very clock had a colour in its fat white face, and looked\r\na clock for Jolly Sandboys to consult--"it\'ll be done to a turn at\r\ntwenty-two minutes before eleven."\r\n\r\nMr. Codlin now bethought him of his companions, and acquainted mine host\r\nof the Sandboys that his partner Short, Nell and her grandfather might\r\nshortly be looked for. At length they arrived drenched with rain and\r\npresenting a most miserable appearance. But their steps were no sooner\r\nheard upon the road than the landlord, who had been at the outer door\r\nanxiously watching for their coming, rushed into the kitchen and took\r\nthe cover off. The effect was electrical. They all came in with smiling\r\nfaces though the wet was dripping from their clothes upon the floor, and\r\nShort\'s first remark was: "What a delicious smell!"\r\n\r\nIt is not very difficult to forget rain and mud by the side of a\r\ncheerful fire, and in a bright room. They were furnished with slippers\r\nand such dry garments as the house or their own bundles afforded, and\r\nseating themselves, as Mr. Codlin had already done, in the warm\r\nchimney-corner, soon forgot their late troubles or only remembered them\r\nas enhancing the delights of the present time.\r\n\r\nStrange footsteps were now heard without, and fresh company entered.\r\nThese were no other than four very dismal dogs, who came pattering in\r\none after the other, headed by an old bandy dog of particularly mournful\r\naspect, who, stopping when the last of his followers had got as far as\r\nthe door, erected himself upon his hind legs and looked round at his\r\ncompanions, who immediately stood upon their hind legs, in a grave and\r\nmelancholy row. Nor was this the only remarkable circumstance about\r\nthese dogs, for each of them wore a kind of little coat of some gaudy\r\ncolour trimmed with tarnished spangles, and one of them had a cap upon\r\nhis head, tied very carefully under his chin, which had fallen down upon\r\nhis nose and completely obscured one eye; add to this, that the gaudy\r\ncoats were all wet through and discoloured with rain, and that the\r\nwearers were splashed and dirty, and some idea may be formed of the\r\nunusual appearance of these new visitors to the Jolly Sandboys.\r\n\r\nNeither Short nor the landlord nor Thomas Codlin, however, was in the\r\nleast surprised, merely remarking that these were Jerry\'s dogs, and that\r\nJerry could not be far behind. So there the dogs stood, patiently\r\nwinking and gaping and looking extremely hard at the boiling pot, until\r\nJerry himself appeared, when they all dropped down at once, and walked\r\nabout the room in their natural manner. This posture, it must be\r\nconfessed, did not much improve their appearance, as their own personal\r\ntails and their coat tails--both capital things in their way--did not\r\nagree together.\r\n\r\nJerry, the manager of these dancing dogs, was a tall black-whiskered man\r\nin a velveteen coat, who seemed well known to the landlord and his\r\nguests and accosted them with great cordiality. Disencumbering himself\r\nof a barrel organ which he placed upon a chair, and retaining in his\r\nhand a small whip wherewith to awe his company of comedians, he came up\r\nto the fire to dry himself, and entered into conversation.\r\n\r\n"Your people don\'t usually travel in character, do they?" said Short,\r\npointing to the dresses of the dogs. "It must come expensive, if they\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"No," replied Jerry, "no, it\'s not the custom with us. But we\'ve been\r\nplaying a little on the road to-day, and we come out with a new wardrobe\r\nat the races, so I didn\'t think it worth while to stop to undress. Down,\r\nPedro!"\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to the dog with the cap on, who, being a new member\r\nof the company, and not quite certain of his duty, kept his unobscured\r\neye anxiously on his master, and was perpetually starting up on his hind\r\nlegs when there was no occasion, and falling down again.\r\n\r\nThe landlord now busied himself in laying the cloth, in which process\r\nMr. Codlin obligingly assisted by setting forth his own knife and fork\r\nin the most convenient place and establishing himself behind them. When\r\neverything was ready, the landlord took off the cover for the last time,\r\nand then, indeed, there burst forth such a goodly promise of supper,\r\nthat if he had offered to put it on again or had hinted at postponement,\r\nhe would certainly have been sacrificed on his own hearth.\r\n\r\nHowever, he did nothing of the kind, but instead assisted a stout\r\nservant girl in turning the contents of the cauldron into a large\r\ntureen; a proceeding which the dogs, proof against various hot splashes\r\nwhich fell upon their noses, watched with terrible eagerness. At length\r\nthe dish was lifted on the table, and mugs of ale having been previously\r\nset round, little Nell ventured to say grace, and supper began.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the poor dogs were standing on their hind legs quite\r\nsurprisingly; the child, having pity on them, was about to cast some\r\nmorsels of food to them before she tasted it herself, hungry though she\r\nwas, when their master interposed.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear, no, not an atom from anybody\'s hand but mine if you\r\nplease. That dog," said Jerry, pointing out the old leader of the troop,\r\nand speaking in a terrible voice, "lost a halfpenny to-day. _He_ goes\r\nwithout his supper."\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate creature dropped upon his forelegs directly, wagged his\r\ntail, and looked imploringly at his master.\r\n\r\n"You must be more careful, sir," said Jerry, walking coolly to the chair\r\nwhere he had placed the organ, and setting the stop. "Come here. Now,\r\nsir, you play away at that, while we have supper, and leave off if you\r\ndare."\r\n\r\nThe dog immediately began to grind most mournful music. His master,\r\nhaving shown him the whip, resumed his seat and called up the others,\r\nwho, at his directions, formed in a row, standing upright as a file of\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n"Now, gentlemen," said Jerry, looking at them attentively: "The dog\r\nwhose name\'s called, eats. The dogs whose names an\'t called, keep quiet.\r\nCarlo."\r\n\r\nThe lucky individual whose name was called, snapped up the morsel thrown\r\ntowards him, but none of the others moved a muscle. In this manner they\r\nwere fed at the discretion of their master. Meanwhile the dog in\r\ndisgrace ground hard at the organ, sometimes in quick time, sometimes in\r\nslow, but never leaving off for an instant. When the knives and forks\r\nrattled very much, or any of his fellows got an unusually large piece of\r\nfat, he accompanied the music with a short howl, but he immediately\r\nchecked it on his master looking round, and applied himself with\r\nincreased diligence to the Old Hundredth.\r\n\r\nDICKENS: "Old Curiosity Shop."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    So, when a great man dies,\r\n      For years beyond our ken,\r\n    The light he leaves behind him lies\r\n      Upon the paths of men.\r\n\r\nLONGFELLOW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLADNESS OF NATURE\r\n\r\n\r\n    Is this a time to be cloudy and sad,\r\n      When our mother Nature laughs around;\r\n    When even the deep blue heavens look glad,\r\n      And gladness breathes from the blossoming ground?\r\n\r\n    There are notes of joy from the hang-bird and wren,\r\n      And the gossip of swallows through all the sky;\r\n    The ground-squirrel gaily chirps by his den,\r\n      And the wilding bee hums merrily by.\r\n\r\n    The clouds are at play in the azure space,\r\n      And their shadows at play on the bright green vale,\r\n    And here they stretch to the frolic chase,\r\n      And there they roll on the easy gale.\r\n\r\n    There\'s a dance of leaves on that aspen bower,\r\n      There\'s a titter of winds in that beechen tree,\r\n    There\'s a smile on the fruit, and a smile on the flower,\r\n      And a laugh from the brook that runs to the sea.\r\n\r\n    And look at the broad-faced sun, how he smiles\r\n      On the dewy earth that smiles in his ray,\r\n    On the leaping waters and gay young isles;\r\n      Ay, look, and he\'ll smile thy gloom away.\r\n\r\nBRYANT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD ENGLISH LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rose on England of olden time, its faint red light stirred\r\nevery sleeper from the sack of straw, which formed the only bed of the\r\nage. Springing from this rustling couch, where he had lain naked, and\r\nthrowing off the coarse coverlets, usually of sheepskin, the subject of\r\nKing Alfred donned the day\'s dress. Gentlemen wore linen or woollen\r\ntunics, which reached to the knee; and, over these, long fur-lined\r\ncloaks, fastened with a brooch of ivory or gold. Strips of cloth or\r\nleather, bandaged crosswise from the ankle to the knee over red and blue\r\nstockings; and black, pointed shoes, slit along the instep almost to the\r\ntoes and fastened with two thongs, completed the costume of an\r\nAnglo-Saxon gentleman. The ladies, wrapping a veil of linen or silk upon\r\ntheir delicate curls, laced a loose-flowing gown over a tight-sleeved\r\nbodice, and pinned the graceful folds of their mantles with golden\r\nbutterflies and other tasteful trinkets.\r\n\r\nBreakfast consisted probably of bread, meat, and ale, but was a lighter\r\nrepast than that taken when the hurry of the day lay behind. Often it\r\nwas eaten in the bower or private apartment.\r\n\r\nThe central picture in Old English life--the great event of the day--was\r\n_Noon-meat_, or dinner in the great hall. A little before three, the\r\nchief and all his household, with any stray guests who might have\r\ndropped in, met in the hall, which stood in the centre of its encircling\r\nbowers--the principal apartment of every Old English house. Clouds of\r\nwood smoke, rolling up from a fire which blazed in the middle of the\r\nfloor, blackened the carved rafters of the arched roof before they found\r\ntheir way out of the hole above which did duty as a chimney.\r\n\r\nTapestries, dyed purple, or glowing with variegated pictures of saints\r\nand heroes, hung, and if the day was stormy, flapped upon the chinky\r\nwalls. In palaces and in earls\' mansions coloured tiles, wrought into a\r\nmosaic, formed a clean and pretty pavement; but the common flooring of\r\nthe time was clay, baked dry with the heat of winter evenings and summer\r\nnoons. The only articles of furniture always in the hall were wooden\r\nbenches; some of which, especially the _high settle_ or seat of the\r\nchieftain, boasted cushions, or at least a rug.\r\n\r\nWhile the hungry crowd, fresh from woodland and furrow, were lounging\r\nnear the fire or hanging up their weapons on the pegs and hooks that\r\njutted from the wall, a number of slaves, dragging in a long, flat,\r\nheavy board, placed it on movable legs, and spread on its upper half a\r\nhandsome cloth. Then were arranged with other utensils for the meal some\r\nflattish dishes, baskets of ash-wood for holding bread, a scanty\r\nsprinkling of steel knives shaped like our modern razors, platters of\r\nwood, and bowls for the universal broth.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of "laying the board," as the Old English phrased it, being\r\ncompleted, the work of demolition began. Great round cakes of\r\nbread--huge junks of boiled bacon--vast rolls of broiled eel--cups of\r\nmilk--horns of ale--wedges of cheese--lumps of salt butter--and smoking\r\npiles of cabbages and beans, melted like magic from the board under the\r\nunited attack of greasy fingers and grinding jaws. Kneeling slaves\r\noffered to the lord and his honoured guests long skewers or spits, on\r\nwhich steaks of beef or venison smoked and sputtered, ready for the\r\nhacking blade.\r\n\r\nPoultry, too, and game of every variety, filled the spaces of the upper\r\nboard; but the crowd of _loaf-eaters_, as old English domestics were\r\nsuggestively called, saw little of these daintier kinds of food, except\r\nthe naked bones. Nor did they much care, if, to their innumerable\r\nhunches of bread, they could add enough pig to appease their hunger.\r\nHounds, sitting eager-eyed by their masters, snapped with sudden jaws at\r\nscraps of fat flung to them, or retired into private life below the\r\nboard with some sweet bone that fortune sent them.\r\n\r\nThe solid part of the banquet ended with the washing of hands, performed\r\nfor the honoured occupants of the high settle by officious slaves. The\r\nboard was then dragged out of the hall; the loaf-eaters slunk away to\r\nhave a nap in the byre, or sat drowsily in corners of the hall; and the\r\ndrinking began. During the progress of the meal, Welsh ale had flowed\r\nfreely in horns or vessels of twisted glass. Mead and, in very grand\r\nhouses, wine now began to circle in goblets of gold and silver, or of\r\nwood inlaid with those precious metals. In humbler houses, story-telling\r\nand songs, sung to the music of the harp by each guest in turn, formed\r\nthe principal amusement of the drinking-bout.\r\n\r\nMeantime the music and the mead did their work in maddening brains; the\r\nrevelry grew louder; riddles, which had flown thick around the board at\r\nfirst, gave place to banter, taunts, and fierce boasts of prowess; angry\r\neyes gleamed defiance; and it was well if, in the morning, the household\r\nslaves had not to wash blood-stains from the pavement of the hall, or in\r\nthe still night, when the drunken brawlers lay stupid on the floor, to\r\ndrag a dead man from the red plash in which he lay.\r\n\r\nFrom the reek and riot of the hall the ladies of the household soon\r\nwithdrew to the bower, where they reigned supreme. There, in the earlier\r\npart of the day, they had arrayed themselves in their bright-coloured\r\nrobes, plying tweezers and crisping-irons on their yellow hair, and\r\noften heightening the blush that Nature gave them with a shade of rouge.\r\nThere, too, they used to scold their female slaves, and beat them, with\r\na violence which said more for their strength of lung and muscle than\r\nfor the gentleness of their womanhood.\r\n\r\nWhen their needles were fairly set a-going upon those pieces of delicate\r\nembroidery, known and prized over all Europe as "English work," some\r\ngentlemen dropped in, perhaps harp in hand, to chat and play for their\r\namusement, or to engage in games of hazard and skill, which seem to have\r\nresembled modern dice and chess. When in later days supper came into\r\nfashion, the round table of the bower was usually spread for\r\n_Evening-food_, as this meal was called. And not long afterwards, those\r\nbags of straw, from which they sprang at sunrise, received for another\r\nnight their human burden, worn out with the labours and the revels of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nW.

All along the Niagara river the greatest excitement had\r\nprevailed: many of the inhabitants had removed with their portable\r\nproperty into the back country; small bodies of soldiers, regulars and\r\nvolunteers, were posted in the towns and villages; Indians were roving\r\nin the adjacent woods; and sentinels, posted along the banks of the\r\nriver, were looking eagerly for the enemy that was to come from the\r\nAmerican shore and attempt the subjugation of a free, a happy, and a\r\nloyal people.\r\n\r\nIn the village of Queenston, that nestles at the foot of an eminence\r\noverlooking the mighty waters of Niagara, two companies of the\r\nForty-ninth Regiment, or "Green Tigers," as the Americans afterwards\r\ntermed them, with one hundred Canadian militia, were posted under the\r\ncommand of Captain Dennis.\r\n\r\nWhen tattoo sounded on the night of the twelfth, the little garrison\r\nretired to rest. All was silent but the elements, which raged furiously\r\nthroughout the night. Nothing was to be heard but the howling of the\r\nwind and the sound of falling rain mingled with the distant roar of the\r\ngreat cataract. Dripping with rain and shivering with cold, the sentries\r\npaced their weary rounds, from time to time casting a glance over the\r\nswollen tide of the river towards the American shore. At length, when\r\nthe gray dawn of morning appeared, a wary sentinel descried a number of\r\nboats, filled with armed men, pushing off from the opposite bank below\r\nthe village of Lewiston. Immediately the alarm was given. The soldiers\r\nwere roused from their peaceful slumbers, and marched down to the\r\nlanding-place. Meanwhile, a battery of one gun, posted on the heights,\r\nand another about a mile below, began to play on the enemy\'s boats,\r\nsinking some and disabling others.\r\n\r\nFinding it impossible to effect a landing in the face of such\r\nopposition, the Americans, leaving a few of their number to occupy the\r\nattention of the troops on the bank, disembarked some distance up the\r\nriver, and succeeded in gaining the summit of the height by a difficult\r\nand unprotected pathway. With loud cheers they captured the one-gun\r\nbattery, and rushed down upon Captain Dennis and his command; who,\r\nfinding themselves far outnumbered by the enemy, retired slowly towards\r\nthe north end of the village. Here they were met by General Brock, who\r\nhad set out in advance of reinforcements from the town of Niagara,\r\naccompanied only by two officers. Placing himself at the head of the\r\nlittle band, the gallant general cried: "Follow me!" and, amid the\r\ncheers of regulars and militia, he led his men back to the height from\r\nwhich they had been forced to retire. At the foot of the hill the\r\ngeneral dismounted, under the sharp fire of the enemy\'s riflemen, who\r\nwere posted among the trees on its summit, climbed over a high stone\r\nwall, and waving his sword, charged up the hill at the head of his\r\nsoldiers. This intrepid conduct at once attracted the notice of the\r\nenemy. One of their sharp-shooters advanced a few paces, took deliberate\r\naim, and shot the general in the breast. It was a mortal wound. Thus\r\nfell Sir Isaac Brock, the hero of Upper Canada, whose name will outlive\r\nthe noble monument which a grateful country has erected to his memory.\r\n\r\nThe fall of their beloved commander infuriated his followers. With loud\r\ncheers of "Revenge the general!" they pressed forward up the hill, and\r\ndrove the enemy from their position. But reinforcements were continually\r\npouring in from the American shore; and after a deadly struggle, in\r\nwhich Colonel Macdonell, Captain Dennis, and most of the other officers\r\nfell, these brave men were again compelled to retire. They took refuge\r\nunder the guns of the lower battery, there awaiting the arrival of\r\nreinforcements from Niagara. About mid-day the first of these arrived,\r\nconsisting of a band of fifty Mohawks, under their chiefs, Norton and\r\nBrant. These Indian allies boldly engaged the enemy, and maintained for\r\na short time a sharp skirmish, but finally retired on the main\r\nreinforcement. This arrived in the course of the afternoon, under the\r\ncommand of Major-General Sheaffe. Instead of meeting the enemy on the\r\nold ground, the officer now in command moved his whole force of one\r\nthousand men to the right of the enemy\'s position, and sent forward his\r\nleft flank to attack the American right. This left flank was of a very\r\nvaried character, consisting of one company of the Forty-first Regiment\r\nof the line, a company of coloured men, and a body of volunteer militia\r\nand Indians, united, in spite of their difference of colour and race, by\r\nloyalty to the British crown and heart-hatred of foreign aggression.\r\nThis division advanced in gallant style. After delivering a volley, the\r\nwhole line of white, red, and black charged the enemy, and drove in his\r\nright wing at the point of the bayonet.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sheaffe now led on the main body, and forced the lately\r\nvictorious Americans to retreat rapidly over the ridge. The struggle on\r\ntheir part was of short duration. In front was a foe thirsting for\r\nrevenge; behind, the steep banks and swiftly-flowing waters of Niagara.\r\nThe "Green Tigers," the Indians, their most despised slaves, and last,\r\nbut certainly not least, the gallant Canadian militia, were objects of\r\nterror to them. Some few in despair threw themselves over the precipices\r\ninto the river; but the majority of the survivors surrendered themselves\r\nprisoners of war, to the number of nine hundred and fifty, among whom\r\nwas their commander, General Wadsworth. The leader of the expedition,\r\nGeneral Van Rensselaer, had retired to Lewiston--as he said, for\r\nreinforcements--in the early part of the day. The loss of the Americans\r\nin this memorable action was about five hundred killed and wounded;\r\nwhile that of the Canadian forces amounted to one hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\nThroughout Canada the news of the victory of Queenston Heights awakened\r\nuniversal joy and enthusiasm, second only to that with which the taking\r\nof Detroit was hailed. But the joy and enthusiasm were damped by the sad\r\ntidings, that he who had first taught Canada\'s sons the way to victory\r\nhad given his life for her defence, and slept in a soldier\'s grave with\r\nmany of her best and bravest.\r\n\r\nUNKNOWN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUGLE SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n        The splendour falls on castle walls\r\n          And snowy summits old in story:\r\n        The long light shakes across the lakes,\r\n          And the wild cataract leaps in glory.\r\n    Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\r\n    Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\r\n\r\n        O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,\r\n          And thinner, clearer, farther going!\r\n        O sweet and far from cliff and scar\r\n          The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!\r\n    Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying:\r\n    Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\r\n\r\n        O love, they die in yon rich sky,\r\n          They faint on hill or field or river:\r\n        Our echoes roll from soul to soul,\r\n          And grow for ever and for ever.\r\n    Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\r\n    And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.\r\n\r\nTENNYSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThough I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not\r\ncharity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though\r\nI have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all\r\nknowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove\r\nmountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all\r\nmy goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and\r\nhave not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\r\n\r\nCharity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity\r\nvaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly,\r\nseeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth\r\nnot in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things,\r\nbelieveth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity\r\nnever faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether\r\nthere be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall\r\nvanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that\r\nwhich is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I\r\nthought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.\r\nFor now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I\r\nknow in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now\r\nabideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nI. CORINTHIANS, XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL\r\n\r\n\r\n    "What means this glory round our feet,"\r\n      The Magi mused, "more bright than morn?"\r\n    And voices chanted clear and sweet,\r\n      "To-day the Prince of Peace is born."\r\n\r\n    "What means that star," the Shepherds said,\r\n      "That brightens through the rocky glen?"\r\n    And angels, answering overhead,\r\n      Sang, "Peace on earth, good-will to men!"\r\n\r\n    \'Tis eighteen hundred years and more\r\n      Since those sweet oracles were dumb;\r\n    We wait for Him, like them of yore;\r\n      Alas, He seems so slow to come!\r\n\r\n    But it was said, in words of gold\r\n      No time or sorrow e\'er shall dim,\r\n    That little children might be bold\r\n      In perfect trust to come to Him.\r\n\r\n    All round about our feet shall shine\r\n      A light like that the wise men saw,\r\n    If we our living wills incline\r\n      To that sweet Life which is the Law.\r\n\r\n    So shall we learn to understand\r\n      The simple faith of shepherds then,\r\n    And, clasping kindly, hand in hand,\r\n      Sing, "Peace on earth, good-will to men."\r\n\r\n    And they who do their souls no wrong,\r\n      But keep at eve the faith of morn,\r\n    Shall daily hear the angel song,\r\n      "To-day the Prince of Peace is born!"\r\n\r\nLOWELL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARREN LANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before the treeless wastes are reached, the forests cease to be\r\nforests except by courtesy. The trees--black and white spruce, the\r\nCanadian larch, and the gray pine, willow, alder, etc.--have an\r\nappearance of youth; so that the traveller would hardly suppose them to\r\nbe more than a few years old, at first sight. Really this juvenile\r\nappearance is a species of second childhood; for, on the shores of the\r\nGreat Bear Lake, four centuries are necessary for the growth of a trunk\r\nnot as thick as a man\'s wrist. The further north the more lamentably\r\ndecrepit becomes the appearance of these woodlands, until, presently,\r\ntheir sordidness is veiled by thick growths of gray lichens--the\r\n"caribou moss," as it is called--which clothe the trunks and hang down\r\nfrom the shrivelled boughs. And still further north the trees become\r\nmere stunted stems, set with blighted buds that have never been able to\r\ndevelop themselves into branches; until, finally, the last vestiges of\r\narboreal growth take refuge under a thick carpet of lichens and mosses,\r\nthe characteristic vegetation of the Barren Grounds.\r\n\r\nNothing more dismal than the winter aspect of these wastes can be\r\nimagined. The Northern forests are silent enough in winter time, but the\r\nsilence of the Barren Grounds is far more profound. Even in the depths\r\nof midwinter the North-Western bush has voices and is full of animal\r\nlife. The barking cry of the crows (these birds are the greatest\r\nimaginable nuisance to the trapper, whose baits they steal even before\r\nhis back is turned) is still heard; the snow-birds and other small\r\nwinged creatures are never quiet between sunset and sunrise; the\r\njack-rabbit, whose black bead-like eye betrays his presence among the\r\nsnow-drifts in spite of his snow-white fur, is common enough; and the\r\nchildlike wailing of the coyotes is heard every night. But with the\r\nexception of the shriek of the snow-owl or the yelping of a fox emerged\r\nfrom his lair, there is no sound of life during seven or eight or nine\r\nmonths of winter on the Barren Grounds; unless the traveller is able to\r\nhear the rushing sound--some can hear it, others cannot--of the shifting\r\nNorthern lights.\r\n\r\nIn May, however, when the snows melt and the swamps begin to thaw, the\r\nBarren Grounds become full of life. To begin with, the sky is literally\r\ndarkened with enormous flights of wild-fowl, whom instinct brings from\r\nthe southern reaches of the Mississippi and its tributaries to these\r\nsub-Arctic wildernesses, where they find an abundance of food, and at\r\nthe same time build their nests and rear their young in safety. The\r\nsnow-geese are the first to arrive; next come the common and eider-duck;\r\nafter them the great northern black-and-red-throated divers; and last of\r\nall the pin-tail and the long-tail ducks. Some of these go no further\r\nthan just beyond the outskirts of the forest region; others, flying\r\nfurther northward, lay their eggs in the open on the moss. Eagles and\r\nhawks prey on these migratory hosts; troops of ptarmigan (they are said\r\nto go to no place where the mercury does not freeze) seek food among the\r\nstunted willows on the shores of the lakes and sloughs; and in sunny\r\nweather the snow-bunting\'s song is heard.\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival of the migratory birds the wilderness becomes\r\nnewly clothed in green and gray. The snow, which never once thaws during\r\nthe long winter, forms a safe protection for vegetable life.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the lengthening summer\'s day has thawed this coverlet of\r\nsnows, vegetation comes on at a surprising rate--a week\'s sunshine on\r\nthe wet soil completely transforming the aspect of the country. It is\r\nthen that the caribou leave their winter quarters in the forest region\r\nand journey to the Barren Grounds.\r\n\r\nJust as the prairies might have been called "Buffalo-land" thirty years\r\nago, and the intervening enforested country may still be styled\r\n"Moose-land"--not that the moose is nearly so common in Saskatchewan and\r\nAthabaska as it was before the rebellion of 1885 opened up that\r\ncountry--so from the hunter\'s point of view "Caribou-land" would be an\r\nexceedingly apt name for the _tundra_ of Greater Canada. Only the\r\nIndians and the Eskimos (the former living on the confines of the\r\nforests, and the latter along the far Arctic coasts) visit these\r\nterritories, and but for the presence of the vast herds of caribou, it\r\nis pretty certain that such mosquito-haunted wastes would never be\r\ntrodden by man. It is true that the musk-ox is an important inhabitant\r\nof the wastes, but the numbers of that strange beast, which seems to be\r\nhalf sheep, half ox, are not nearly so great, and there are reasons to\r\nbelieve that it is being slowly but surely driven from its ancient\r\npastures by the caribou, just as, in so many parts of the world, the\r\nnations of the antelope have receded before the deer-tribes.\r\n\r\nE.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n'
