SANDERS, A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nTHIS FOURTH READER is designed to pass the pupil from the comparatively\r\neasy ground occupied by the THIRD to the more difficult course embraced\r\nin THE UNION FIFTH READER, which is next higher in the series. It is,\r\ntherefore, carefully graded to this intermediate position.\r\n\r\nIn one sense, however, it is the most important in the set; since the\r\ngreat mass of pupils, in our common schools, are drawn away from\r\nscholastic pursuits long before the proper time for entering upon any\r\ncourse of reading more advanced than that which is here presented. This\r\nconsideration has had its full weight in the preparation of the\r\nfollowing pages.\r\n\r\nEvery exercise will be found to bear the impress of that special\r\nadaptation to the purposes of teaching, without which no book of this\r\nkind can fully perform the office which it assumes. The labor expended\r\nin this direction, though all unseen by the casual observer, has been\r\nneither light nor brief. It can be duly appreciated by none but the\r\nexperienced teacher.\r\n\r\nAll words in the exercises, requiring explanation, have been arranged,\r\nas regular lessons in spelling and definition. In these definitions,\r\nhowever, it must be kept in mind, that no attempt has been made to give\r\n_all the meanings of which a word is susceptible, but that only which it\r\nbears in the particular place in the exercise where it is found._ There\r\nis a special educational advantage in thus leading the mind of the pupil\r\ndefinitely to fix upon the _precise import_ of a word, in some\r\nparticular use or application of it.\r\n\r\nAll proper names occurring in the text, and at all likely to embarrass\r\nthe learner, have been explained in brief, comprehensive notes. These\r\nnotes involve many matters, Geographical, Biographical, and Historical,\r\nwhich are not a little interesting in themselves, aside from the special\r\npurpose subserved by them in the present connection.\r\n\r\nAll this has been done, and more, in order to secure that kind of\r\ninterest in the exercises which comes of reading what is clearly\r\nunderstood; and because no perfect reading is possible, where the reader\r\nhimself fails to perceive the meaning of what he reads.\r\n\r\nIn the selection and adaptation of the pieces, the highest aim has been\r\nto make and to leave the best moral impression; and this, not by dull\r\nand formal teachings, but by the pleasanter, and, therefore, more\r\npowerful, means of incidental and unexpected suggestion. Admonition is\r\nthen most likely to be heeded, when it comes through the channel of\r\nevents and circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe direct and ostensible aim of the book, however, has been kept\r\nsteadily in view; which is to furnish the best possible exercises for\r\npractice in Rhetorical reading. To this end, the greatest variety of\r\nstyle and sentiment has been sought. There is scarcely a tone or\r\nmodulation, of which the human voice is capable, that finds not here\r\nsome piece adapted precisely to its best expression. There is not an\r\ninflection, however delicate, not an emphasis, however slight, however\r\nstrong, that does not here meet with something fitted well for its\r\namplest illustration. No tenderness of pathos, no earnestness of\r\nthought, no play of wit, no burst of passion, is there, perhaps, of\r\nwhich the accomplished teacher of Elocution may not find the proper\r\nstyle of expression in these pages, and, consequently, the best examples\r\nfor the illustration of his art.\r\n\r\nThe book, thus briefly described, is, therefore, given to the public\r\nwith the same confidence that has hitherto inspired the author in\r\nsimilar efforts, and with the hope that it may reach even a higher\r\nmeasure of usefulness than that attained by any of its predecessors, in\r\nthe long line of works which he has prepared for the use of schools.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, April, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIRST.\r\nELOCUTION.\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--ARTICULATION\r\n\r\n   ELEMENTARY SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS\r\n\r\n   SUBSTITUTES FOR THE VOWEL ELEMENTS\r\n\r\n   SUBSTITUTES FOR THE CONSONANT ELEMENTS\r\n\r\n   ERRORS IN ARTICULATION\r\n\r\n   COMBINATIONS OF CONSONANTS\r\n\r\n   EXAMPLES TO ILLUSTRATE INDISTINCT ARTICULATION\r\n\r\n   MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES\r\n\r\nSECTION II--ACCENT AND EMPHASIS\r\n\r\n   EXAMPLES OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ACCENT\r\n\r\n   EXAMPLES OF INTENSIVE EMPHASIS\r\n\r\n   EXAMPLES OF ABSOLUTE EMPHASIS\r\n\r\n   EXAMPLES OF ANTITHETIC EMPHASIS\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--INFLECTIONS\r\n\r\n   MONOTONE\r\n\r\n   RISING AND FALLING INFLECTIONS\r\n\r\n   RULES FOR THE USE OF INFLECTIONS\r\n\r\n   THE CIRCUMFLEX\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--MODULATION\r\n\r\n   PITCH OF VOICE\r\n\r\n   QUANTITY\r\n\r\n   RULES FOR QUANTITY\r\n\r\n   QUALITY\r\n\r\n   RULES FOR QUALITY\r\n\r\nNOTATION IN MODULATION\r\n\r\n   EXAMPLES FOR EXERCISE IN MODULATION\r\n\r\n   SECTION V.--THE RHETORICAL PAUSE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SECOND.\r\n\r\n1.

THE LOST ONE\'S LAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF THE PAUSES.\r\n\r\n                                 .\r\nThe Period is the longest pause--a full stop. It marks the end of a\r\nsentence, and shows the sense complete; as, The sky is blue`. Pause the\r\ntime of counting _six_, and let the voice fall.\r\n\r\n                                 ?\r\n\r\nThe Interrogation is used at the end of a question; as, Is the sky\r\nblue\'? If the question can be answered by _yes_ or _no_, the voice\r\nrises; if not, it falls; as, Where is your map`;? Pause the time of\r\ncounting _six_.\r\n\r\n                                 !\r\n\r\nThe Exclamation denotes wonder, surprise, pain, or joy; as, O\'! what a\r\nsweet rose`! Pause the time of counting _one_, after a single word, and\r\nlet the voice rise; but after a complete sentence, pause the time of\r\ncounting _six_, and let the voice fall.\r\n\r\n                                 :\r\n\r\nThe Colon is a pause shorter than the Period; as, The sky is clear`: the\r\nsun shines. Pause the time of counting _four_, and let the voice fall.\r\n\r\n                                 ;\r\n\r\nThe Semicolon is a pause shorter than the Colon; as, The rose is fair`;\r\nbut it soon fades. Pause the time of counting _two_, and let the voice\r\nfall. Sometimes the voice should rise, as the sense may require.\r\n\r\n                                 ,\r\n\r\nThe Comma is the shortest pause; as, Jane goes to school\', and learns to\r\nread. Pause the time of counting _one_, and keep the voice up.\r\n\r\n                                 --\r\n\r\nThe Dash denotes a sudden pause or change of subject; as, I saw him--but\r\nwhat a sight! When the dash is used after any other pause, the time of\r\nthat pause is doubled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF OTHER MARKS.\r\n\r\n                                 \'\r\n\r\nThe Apostrophe has the form of the comma. It denotes the possessive\r\ncase; as, John\'s book; also, that one or more letters have been left out\r\nof a word; as, lov\'d for loved.\r\n\r\n                                " "\r\n\r\nThe Quotation includes a passage that is taken from some other author or\r\nspeaker; as, John said: "See my kite."\r\n\r\n                                ( )\r\n\r\nThe Parenthesis includes words not properly a part of the main sentence;\r\nas, I like these people (who would not?) very much. The words within the\r\nparenthesis should be read in a lower tone of voice.\r\n\r\n                                [ ]\r\n\r\nThe Brackets inclose words that serve to explain the preceding word or\r\nsentence; as, James [the truthful boy] went home.\r\n\r\n                                 ^\r\n\r\nThe Caret shows where words are to be put in that have been omitted by\r\nmistake; as, Live ^in peace.\r\n\r\n                                (..)\r\n\r\nThe Diaresis is placed over the latter of two vowels, to show that they\r\nbelong to two distinct syllables; as, aerial.\r\n\r\n                                 -\r\n\r\nThe Hyphen is used to connect compound words; as, Well-doing; or the\r\nparts of a word separated at the end of a line.\r\n\r\n                               [Index]\r\n\r\nThe Index points to something special or remarkable; as, => Important\r\nNews!\r\n\r\n                          *** .... or ----\r\n\r\nThe Ellipsis shows that certain words or letters have been purposely\r\nomitted; as, K**g, k..g, or k--g, for king.\r\n\r\n                            [Paragraph]\r\n\r\nThe Paragraph denotes the beginning of a new subject. It is chiefly used\r\nin the Bible; as, [Paragraph] The same day came to him, etc.\r\n\r\n                             [Section]\r\n\r\nThe Section is used to divide a book or chapter into parts; as,\r\n[Section]45.\r\n\r\n                    * [Obelisk] [Double Dagger]\r\n\r\nThe Asterisk, the Obelisk, the Double Dagger, and sometimes other marks,\r\n[Footnote: For instance: the Section mark, [Section], and the Parallel,\r\n||.] refer to notes in the margin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS OF THE MARKS USED IN WRITING.\r\n\r\n LINE\r\n   1 My Young Friends\', never tell a falsehood`; but always\r\n\r\n   2 speak the truth`; this is pleasing to your Maker.\r\n\r\n   3   Do  you  read  His  holy  word--the  Bible\'?  O!  remem-\r\n\r\n   4 ber, that He has there said: "He that speaketh lies, shall\r\n\r\n   5 not escape: he shall perish."* Remember, too, that the\r\n\r\n   6 All-seeing God knows all that we say or do.\r\n\r\n\r\n   7   [Paragraph] Tho\' wisdom\'s voice is seldom heard in k--g\'s\r\n\r\n   8 palaces,--there have been _wise_ kings, (_e.g._ Solomon,) who\r\n\r\n   9 were lov\'d and obey\'d by their subjects.[Obelisk]\r\n\r\n\r\n  10   Here, [i.e. in the U.S.,] we can not  boast of  our kings,\r\n\r\n  11 princes,  lords, &c.; yet  we  have  had  a  PRESIDENT, who,\r\n\r\n  12 in true  greatness,  surpass\'ed  them  all; viz., the  great\r\n\r\n  13 WASHINGTON.---- [Index]  Washington  feared  and hon-\r\n\r\n  14 ored God.\r\n\r\n\r\n  15 [S] Section, [/=] Double Dagger, and || Parallel, are also used\r\n\r\n  16 for reference to the margin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        * Proverbs xix. 5 and 9.

Accordingly, it demands,\r\nin a _special_ manner, attention to the following particulars; viz.,\r\nARTICULATION, ACCENT, EMPHASIS, INFLECTION, MODULATION, and PAUSES.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nARTICULATION.\r\n\r\nArticulation is the art of uttering distinctly and justly the letters\r\nand syllables constituting a word.\r\n\r\nIt deals, therefore, with the elements of words, just as elocution deals\r\nwith the elements of sentences: the one securing the true enunciation of\r\neach letter, or combination of letters, the other giving to each word,\r\nor combination of words, such a delivery as best expresses the meaning\r\nof the author. It is the basis of all good reading, and should be\r\ncarefully practiced by the learner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEMENTARY SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS.\r\n\r\nVOWEL SOUNDS.\r\n\r\nTONICS.\r\n\r\n  _Element_.         _Power_.\r\n\r\n   1.--1 A    as in   _A_pe.\r\n   2.--2 A      "     _A_rm.\r\n   3.--3 A      "     _A_ll.\r\n   4.--4 A      "     _A_t.\r\n   5.--5 A      "     C_a_re.\r\n   6.--6 A      "     _A_sk.\r\n   7.--1 E      "     _E_ve.\r\n   8.--2 E      "     _E_nd.\r\n   9.--1 I      "     _I_ce.\r\n  10.--2 I      "     _I_t.\r\n  11.--1 O      "     _O_ld.\r\n  12.--2 O      "     D_o_.\r\n  13.--3 O      "     _O_x.\r\n  14.--1 U      "     _U_se.\r\n  15.--2 U      "     _U_p.\r\n  16.--3 U      "     P_u_ll.\r\n  17.--OI       "     O_i_l.\r\n  18.--OU       "     O_u_t.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSONANT SOUNDS.\r\n\r\nSUB-TONICS.\r\n\r\n  19.--B      as in   _B_at.\r\n  20.--D        "     _D_un.\r\n  21.--G        "     _G_un.\r\n  22.--J        "     _J_et.\r\n  23.--L        "     _L_et.\r\n  24.--M        "     _M_an.\r\n  25.--N        "     _N_ot.\r\n  26.--R        "     _R_un.\r\n  27.--V        "     _V_ent.\r\n  28.--W        "     _W_ent.\r\n  29.--Y        "     _Y_es.\r\n  30.--1 Z      "     _Z_eal.\r\n  31.--2 Z      "     A_z_ure.\r\n  32.--NG       "     Si_ng_.\r\n  33.--TH       "     _Th_y.\r\n\r\nA-TONICS.\r\n\r\n  34.--F     as in   _F_it.\r\n  35.--H       "     _H_at.\r\n  36.--K       "     _K_id.\r\n  36.--P       "     _P_it.\r\n  38.--S       "     _S_in.\r\n  39.--T       "     _T_op.\r\n  40.--CH      "     _Ch_at.\r\n  41.--SH      "     _Sh_un.\r\n  42.--TH      "     _Th_in.\r\n  43.--WH      "     _Wh_en.\r\n\r\n  21: Soft G is equivalent to J; soft C to S, and hard C and Q to K.\r\n      X is equivalent to K and S, as in _box_, or to G and Z\r\n      as in _exalt_.\r\n\r\n  42: WH is pronounced as if the H preceded W, otherwise it would be\r\n      pronounced _W hen_.

When, however,\r\ndifferent degrees of emphasis are to be denoted, the higher degrees are\r\ndesignated by the use of Capitals, LARGER or SMALLER, according to the\r\ndegree of intensity.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1.

Does his conduct deserve _ap\'_probation or\r\n_rep\'_robation?\r\n\r\nNOTE VI.--There are two kinds of Emphasis:--_Absolute_ and _Antithetic_.\r\nABSOLUTE EMPHASIS is used to designate the important words of a\r\nsentence, without any direct reference to other words.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES OF ABSOLUTE EMPHASIS.\r\n\r\n  1.

Has _James_ seen his brother to-day? No; but _Charles_ has.\r\n\r\n  2. Has James _seen_ his brother to-day? No; but he has _heard_\r\n     from him.\r\n\r\n  3. Has James seen _his_ brother to-day? No; but he saw _yours_.\r\n\r\n  4. Has James seen his _brother_ to-day? No; but he has seen his\r\n     _sister_.\r\n\r\n  5. Has James seen his brother _to-day_? No; but he saw him _yesterday_.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--To determine the emphatic words of a sentence, as well as the\r\n_degree_ and _kind_ of emphasis to be employed, the reader must be\r\ngoverned wholly by the _sentiment_ to be expressed. The idea is\r\nsometimes entertained that emphasis consists merely in _loudness_ of\r\ntone. But it should be borne in mind that the most _intense_ emphasis\r\nmay often be effectively expressed, even by a whisper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nINFLECTIONS.\r\n\r\nINFLECTIONS are turns or slides of the voice, made in reading or\r\nspeaking; as; Will you go to New [Transcriber\'s Note: Two missing lines\r\nin printing, page 25 in original.] or to [Transcriber\'s Note: Remainder\r\nof paragraph is missing.]\r\n\r\nAll the various sounds of the human voice may be comprehended under the\r\ngeneral appellation of _tones_. The principal modifications of these\r\ntones are the MONOTONE, the RISING INFLECTION, the FALLING INFLECTION,\r\nand the CIRCUMFLEX.\r\n\r\n  The Horizontal Line (--)   denotes the Monotone.\r\n  The Rising Slide    (/)    denotes the Rising Inflection.\r\n  The Falling Slide   (\\)    denotes the Falling Inflection.\r\n  The Curve           (\\_/)  denotes the Circumflex.\r\n\r\nThe MONOTONE is that sameness of sound, which arises from repeating the\r\nseveral words or syllables of a passage in one and the same general\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--The Monotone is employed with admirable effect in the delivery\r\nof a passage that is solemn or sublime.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. O thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers: whence\r\nare thy beams, O sun, thy everlasting light? OSSIAN.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n  \'Tis midnight\'s holy hour, and silence now\r\n  Is brooding, like a gentle spirit, o\'er\r\n  The still and pulseless world. Hark! on the winds\r\n  The bells\' deep tones are swelling; \'tis the knell\r\n  Of the departed year.\r\n                                                              PRENTICE.\r\n\r\n3. God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His\r\nglory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of His praise.\r\n\r\n4. Before Him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at His\r\nfeet. He stood and measured the earth: He beheld, and drove asunder the\r\nnations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual\r\nhills did bow: His ways are everlasting. BIBLE.\r\n\r\n5. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His\r\nhandy work. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth\r\nknowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not\r\nheard. ID.\r\n\r\n6.\r\n  How brief is life! how passing brief!\r\n  How brief its joys and cares!\r\n  It seems to be in league with time,\r\n  And leaves us unawares.\r\n\r\n7. The thunder rolls: be hushed the prostrate world,\r\n   While cloud to cloud returns the solemn hymn. THOMSON.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--The inappropriate use of the monotone,--a fault into which\r\nyoung people naturally fall,--is a very grave and obstinate error. It is\r\nalways tedious, and often even ridiculous. It should be studiously\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nThe RISING INFLECTION is an upward turn, or slide of the voice, used in\r\nreading or speaking; as,\r\n\r\n                                        s?\r\n                                       n/\r\n                                      o/\r\n                                     s/\r\n                                    s/\r\n                                   e/\r\n  Are you prepared to recite your l/\r\n\r\nThe FALLING INFLECTION is a downward turn, or slide of the voice, used\r\nin reading or speaking; as,\r\n\r\n               \\d\r\n                \\o\r\n                 \\i\r\n                  \\n\r\n  What are you     \\g?\r\n\r\nIn the falling inflection, the voice should not sink below the _general\r\npitch_; but in the rising inflection, it is raised above it.\r\n\r\nThe two inflections may be illustrated by the following diagrams:\r\n\r\n  1.\r\n                            \\i\r\n                             \\m\r\n                     y,       \\p                   \\p\r\n                    l/         \\r                   \\r\r\n                   t/           \\u                   \\u\r\n                  n/             \\d                   \\d\r\n                 e/               \\e                   \\e\r\n                d/                 \\n                   \\n\r\n               u/                   \\t                   \\t\r\n              r/                     \\l                   \\l\r\n  Did he act p/          or           \\y?

The due degree to be employed, depends on the\r\n_nature_ of what is to be expressed. For example; if a person, under\r\ngreat excitement, asks another:\r\n\r\n                   t?\r\n                  s\r\n                 e\r\n                n\r\n               r\r\n              a\r\n  Are you in e        the degree of inflection would be much greater,\r\n\r\n                                                    t?\r\n                                                  s\r\n                                                e\r\n                                              n\r\n                                            r\r\n                                          a\r\n  than if he playfully asks: Are you in e              The former\r\n  inflection may be called _intensive_, the latter, _common_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES FOR THE USE OF INFLECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE I.\r\n\r\nDirect questions, or those which may be answered by _yes_ or _no_,\r\nusually take the rising inflection; but their answers, generally, the\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. Will you meet me at the depot\'? Yes`; or, I will`.\r\n\r\n2. Did you intend to visit Boston\'? No`; or, I did not`.\r\n\r\n3. Can you explain this difficult sentence\'? Yes`; I can.\r\n\r\n4. Are they willing to remain at home\'? They are`.\r\n\r\n5. Is this a time for imbecility and inaction\'? By no means`.\r\n\r\n6. King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets\'? I know that thou\r\nbelievest`.\r\n\r\n7. Were the tribes of this country, when first discovered, making any\r\nprogress in arts and civilization\'? By no means`.\r\n\r\n8. To purchase heaven has gold the power\'?\r\n   Can gold remove the mortal hour\'?\r\n   In life, can love be bought with gold\'?\r\n   Are friendship\'s pleasures to be sold\'?\r\n   No`; all that\'s worth a wish, a thought,\r\n   Fair virtue gives unbribed, unbought.\r\n\r\n9. What would content you`? Talents\'? No`. Enterprise\'? No`. Courage\'?\r\nNo`. Reputation\'? No`. Virtue\'? No`. The man whom you would select,\r\nshould possess not one, but all of these`.\r\n\r\nNOTE I.--When the direct question becomes an appeal, and the reply to it\r\nis anticipated, it takes the intense _falling_ inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. _Is_` he not a bold and eloquent speaker`?\r\n\r\n2. _Can_` such inconsistent measures be adopted`?\r\n\r\n3. _Did_` you ever hear of such cruel barbarities`?\r\n\r\n4. _Is_ this reason`? _Is_` it law`? _Is_ it humanity`?\r\n\r\n5. _Was_` not the gentleman\'s argument conclusive`?\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE II.\r\n\r\nIndirect questions, or those which can not be answered by _yes_ or _no_,\r\nusually take the _falling_ inflection, and their answers the same.\r\n\r\n1. How far did you travel yesterday`? Forty miles`.\r\n\r\n2. Which of you brought this beautiful bouquet`? Julia`.\r\n\r\n3. Where do you intend to spend the summer`? At Saratoga`.\r\n\r\n4. When will Charles graduate at college`? Next year`.\r\n\r\n5. What is one of the most delightful emotions of the heart`? Gratitude`.\r\n\r\nNOTE I.--When the indirect question is one asking a repetition of what\r\nwas not, at first, understood, it takes the _rising_ inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. When do you expect to return? Next week.\r\n   When_ did you say\'? Next week.\r\n\r\n2. _Where_ did you say William had gone\'? To New York.\r\n\r\nNOTE II.--Answers to questions, whether direct or indirect, when\r\nexpressive of indifference, take the _rising_ inflection, or the\r\ncircumflex.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. Did you admire his discourse? Not much\'.\r\n\r\n2. Which way shall we walk? I am not particular\'.\r\n\r\n3. Can Henry go with us? If he chooses\'.\r\n\r\n4. What color do you prefer? I have no particular choice\'.\r\n\r\nNOTE III.--In some instances, direct questions become indirect by a\r\nchange of the inflection from the rising to the falling.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. Will you come to-morrow\' or next day\'? Yes.\r\n\r\n2. Will you come to-morrow,\' or next day`? I will come to-morrow.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--The first question asks if the person addressed will _come_\r\nwithin the two days, and may be answered by _yes_ or _no_; but the\r\nsecond asks on _which_ of the two days he will come, and it can not be\r\nthus answered.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE III.\r\n\r\nWhen questions are connected by the conjunction _or_, the first requires\r\nthe _rising_, and the second, the _falling_ inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. Does he study for amusement\', or improvement`?\r\n\r\n2. Was he esteemed for his wealth\', or for his wisdom`?\r\n\r\n3. Sink\' or swim`, live\' or die`, survive\' or perish`, I give my hand\r\nand heart to this vote. WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n4. Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath-days\', or to do evil`? to save\r\nlife\', or to kill`?\r\n\r\n5. Was it an act of moral courage\', or cowardice`, for Cato to fall on\r\nhis sword`?\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE IV. Antithetic terms or clauses usually take opposite inflections;\r\ngenerally, the former has the _rising_, and the latter the _falling_\r\ninflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. If you seek to make one rich, study not to increase his stores\' but\r\nto diminish his desires`.\r\n\r\n2. They have mouths\',--but they speak not`:\r\n   Eyes have they\',--but they see not`:\r\n   They have ears\',--but they hear not`:\r\n   Noses have they\',--but they smell not`:\r\n   They have hands\',--but they handle not`:\r\n   Feet have they\',--but they walk not`.\r\n                                          BIBLE.\r\n\r\nNOTE I.--When one of the antithetic clauses is a _negative_, and the\r\nother an _affirmative_, generally the negative has the _rising_, and\r\nthe affirmative the _falling_ inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. I said an elder soldier` not a better\'.\r\n\r\n2. His acts deserve punishment` rather than commiseration\'.\r\n\r\n3. This is no time for a tribunal of justice\', but for showing mercy`;\r\nnot for accusation\', but for philanthropy`; not for trial\', but for\r\npardon`; not for sentence and execution\', but for compassion and\r\nkindness`.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE V. The Pause of Suspension, denoting that the sense is incomplete,\r\nusually has the _rising_ inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. Although the fig tree shall not blossom\', neither shall fruit be in\r\nthe vine\'; the labor of the olive shall fail\', and the fields shall\r\nyield no meat\'; the flocks shall be cut off from the fold\', and there\r\nshall be no herd in the stalls\'; yet will I rejoice in the Lord`, I will\r\njoy in the God of my salvation`. BIBLE.\r\n\r\nNOTE I.--The ordinary direct address, not accompanied with strong\r\nemphasis, takes the _rising_ inflection, on the principle of the pause\r\nof suspension.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. Men\', brethren\', and fathers\', hear ye my defense which I make now\r\nunto you. BIBLE.\r\n\r\n2. Ye living flowers\', that skirt the eternal frost\'!\r\n   Ye wild goats\', sporting round the eagle\'s nest\'!\r\n   Ye eagles\', playmates of the mountain storm\'!\r\n   Ye lightnings\', the dread arrows of the clouds\'!\r\n   Ye signs\' and wonders\' of the elements\'!\r\n   Utter forth GOD`, and fill the hills with praise`!\r\n                                                             COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\nNOTE II.--In some instances of a pause of suspension, the sense requires\r\nan intense _falling_ inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n1. The prodigal, if he does not become a _pauper_`, will, at least, have\r\nbut little to bestow on others.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--If the _rising_ inflection is given on _pauper_, the sense\r\nwould be perverted, and the passage made to mean, that, in order to be\r\nable to bestow on others, it is necessary that he should become a\r\npauper.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE VI. Expressions of tenderness, as of grief, or kindness, commonly\r\nincline the voice to the _rising_ inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. Mother\',--I leave thy dwelling\';\r\n     Oh! shall it be forever\'?\r\n   With grief my heart is swelling\',\r\n     From thee\',--from thee\',--to sever\'.\r\n\r\n2. O my son Absalom\'! my son\', my son Absalom\'! Would God I had died for\r\nthee\', Absalom\', my son\', my son\'! BIBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE VII. The Penultimate Pause, or the last but one, of a passage, is\r\nusually preceded by the _rising_ inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. Diligence`, industry`, and proper improvement of time\', are material\r\nduties of the young`.\r\n\r\n2. These through faith subdued kingdoms`, wrought righteous-ness`,\r\nobtained promises`, stopped the mouths of lions`, quenched the violence\r\nof fire`, escaped the edge of the sword`, out of weakness were made\r\nstrong`, waxed valiant in fight\', turned to flight the armies of the\r\naliens`.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--The rising inflection is employed at the penultimate pause in\r\norder to promote variety, since the voice generally falls at the end of\r\na sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE VIII. Expressions of strong emotion, as of anger or surprise, and\r\nalso the language of authority and reproach, are expressed with the\r\n_falling_ inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. On YOU`, and on your CHILDREN`, be the peril of the innocent blood\r\nwhich shall be shed this day`.\r\n\r\n2. What a piece of workmanship is MAN`! How noble in REASON`!

HENCE`, HOME`, _you idle creatures_`, GET YOU HOME`, YOU BLOCKS`, YOU\r\nSTONES`, YOU WORSE THAN USELESS THINGS`!\r\n\r\n5. Avaunt`! and quit my sight`! let the earth hide thee`! Thy bones are\r\nmarrowless`; thou hast no speculation in thine eyes which thou dost\r\nglare` with. SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\n6. Slave, do thy office`! Strike`, as I struck the foe`!\r\n   Strike`, as I would have struck the tyrants`!\r\n   Strike deep as my curse`! Strike`, and but once`! ID.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE IX. An emphatic succession of particulars, and emphatic repetition,\r\nrequire the _falling_ inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. _Beware_` what earth calls happiness; BEWARE`\r\n   All joys but joys that never can expire`.\r\n\r\n2. A great mind`, a great heart`, a great orator`, a great career`, have\r\nbeen consigned to history`. BUTLER.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--The stress of voice on each successive particular, or\r\nrepetition, should gradually be increased as the subject advances.\r\n\r\nThe CIRCUMFLEX is a union of the two inflections on the same word,\r\nbeginning either with the _falling_ and ending with the _rising_, or\r\nwith the _rising_ and ending with the _falling_; as, If he goes to ____\r\nI shall go to ____.\r\n\r\nThe circumflex is mainly employed in the language of irony, and in\r\nexpressing ideas implying some condition, either expressed or\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. You, a beardless youth, pretend to teach a British general.\r\n\r\n2. What! shear a wolf? a prowling wolf?\r\n\r\n3. My father\'s trade? ah, really, that\'s too bad!\r\n   My father\'s trade?

What! confer a crown on the author of the public calamities?\r\n\r\n5. But you are very wise men, and deeply learned in the truth; we are\r\nweak, contemptible, mean persons.\r\n\r\n6.

And this man has become a god and Cassius a wretched creature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nMODULATION.\r\n\r\nMODULATION implies those variations of the voice, heard in reading or\r\nspeaking, which are prompted by the feelings and emotions that the\r\nsubject inspires.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nEXPRESSIVE OF COURAGE AND CHIVALROUS EXCITEMENT.\r\n\r\n  FULL   .- Once more unto the breach, dear friends, _once more_,\r\n  TONE   \'- Or close the wall up with our English dead!\r\n  MIDDLE .- In peace, there\'s nothing so becomes a man,\r\n  TONE   \'- As modest stillness and humility;\r\n         .- But when the blast of war blows in our ears,\r\n  SHORT  |  Then imitate the action of the tiger;\r\n  AND    +  Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,\r\n  QUICK  \'- Disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage.\r\n         .- _On_, ON, you noblest English,\r\n  HIGH   |  Whose blood is fetched from fathers of war-proof!\r\n  AND    +  _Fathers_, that, like so many Alexanders,\r\n  LOUD   |  Have, in these parts, from morn till even fought,\r\n         \'- And sheathed their swords for lack of argument.\r\n  QUICK  .- I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,\r\n  AND    |  Straining upon the start.

GEORGE!\r\n\r\n                                                            SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--To read the foregoing example in one dull, monotonous tone of\r\nvoice, without regard to the sentiment expressed, would render the\r\npassage extremely insipid and lifeless. But by a proper modulation of\r\nthe voice, it infuses into the mind of the reader or hearer the most\r\nanimating and exciting emotions.\r\n\r\nThe voice is modulated in _three_ different ways. _First_, it is varied\r\nin PITCH; that is, from _high_ to _low_ tones, and the reverse.\r\n_Secondly_, it is varied in QUANTITY, or in _loudness_ or _volume_ of\r\nsound. _Thirdly_, it is varied in QUALITY, or in the _kind_ of sound\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPITCH OF VOICE.\r\n\r\nPitch of voice has reference to its degree of elevation.\r\n\r\nEvery person, in reading or speaking, assumes a certain pitch, which may\r\nbe either _high_ or _low_, according to circumstances, and which has a\r\ngoverning influence on the variations of the voice, above and below it.\r\nThis degree of elevation is usually called the KEY NOTE.\r\n\r\nAs an exercise in varying the voice in pitch, the practice of uttering a\r\nsentence on the several degrees of elevation, as represented in the\r\nfollowing scale, will be found beneficial. First, utter the musical\r\nsyllables, then the vowel sound, and lastly, the proposed\r\nsentence,--ascending and descending.\r\n\r\n  ---------8.--do--#--_e_-in-m_e_.---Virtue alone survives.----\r\n          7.  si  #  _i_ in d_i_e.

Virtue alone survives\r\n\r\nAlthough the voice is capable of as many variations in speaking, as are\r\nmarked on the musical scale, yet for all the purposes of ordinary\r\nelocution, it will be sufficiently exact if we make but _three_ degrees\r\nof variation, viz., the _Low_, the _Middle_, and the _High_.\r\n\r\n1. THE LOW PITCH is that which falls below the usual speaking key, and\r\nis employed in expressing emotions of _sublimity_, _awe_, and\r\n_reverence_.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n  Silence, how dead! darkness, how profound!\r\n  Nor eye, nor list\'ning ear, an object finds;\r\n  Creation sleeps. \'Tis as the general pulse\r\n  Of life stood still, and Nature made a pause.--\r\n  An awful pause! prophetic of her end.\r\n                                                                 YOUNG.\r\n\r\n2. THE MIDDLE PITCH is that usually employed in common conversation, and\r\nin expressing _unimpassioned thought_ and _moderate emotion_.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. It was early in a summer morning, when the air was cool, the earth\r\nmoist, the whole face of the creation fresh and gay, that I lately\r\nwalked in a beautiful flower garden, and, at once, regaled the senses\r\nand indulged the fancy. HERVEY.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n  "_I love to live_," said a prattling boy,\r\n  As he gayly played with his new-bought toy,\r\n  And a merry laugh went echoing forth,\r\n  From a bosom filled with joyous mirth.\r\n\r\n3. THE HIGH PITCH is that which rises above the usual speaking key, and\r\nis used in expressing _joyous_ and _elevated feelings_.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n  Higher, _higher_, EVER HIGHER,--\r\n  Let the watchword be "ASPIRE!"\r\n    Noble Christian youth;\r\n  Whatsoe\'er be God\'s behest,\r\n  Try to do that duty best,\r\n    In the strength of Truth.\r\n                                                           M.F. TUPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUANTITY.\r\n\r\nQUANTITY is two-fold;--consisting in FULLNESS or VOLUME of sound, as\r\n_soft_ or _loud_; and in TIME, as _slow_ or _quick_. The former has\r\nreference to STRESS; the latter, to MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe degrees of variation in quantity are numerous, varying from a\r\nslight, soft whisper to a vehement shout. But for all practical\r\npurposes, they may be considered as _three_, the same as in pitch;--the\r\n_soft_, the _middle_, and the _loud_.\r\n\r\nFor exercise in quantity, let the pupil read any sentence, as,\r\n\r\n  "Beauty is a fading flower,"\r\n\r\nfirst in a slight, soft tone, and then repeat it, gradually increasing\r\nin quantity to the full extent of the voice. Also, let him read it first\r\nvery slowly, and then repeat it, gradually increasing the movement. In\r\ndoing this, he should be careful not to vary the pitch.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, let him repeat any vowel sound, or all of them, and also\r\ninversely. Thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note: The illustration is a row of the letter "O,"\r\nincreasing in size across the page, followed by a row of the letter "O"\r\ndecreasing in size. The presumed intent is to convey loudness.]\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK.--Quantity is often mistaken for Pitch. But it should be borne in\r\nmind that quantity has reference to _loudness_ or _volume_ of sound, and\r\npitch to the _elevation_ or _depression_ of a tone. The difference may\r\nbe distinguished by the slight and heavy strokes on a bell;--both of\r\nwhich produce sounds alike in _pitch_; but they differ in _quantity_ or\r\n_loudness_, in proportion as the strokes are light or heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES FOR QUANTITY.\r\n\r\n1. SOFT, OR SUBDUED TONES, are those which range from a whisper to a\r\ncomplete vocality, and are used to express _fear_, _caution_, _secrecy_,\r\n_solemnity_, and all _tender emotions_.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1.\r\n  We watched her breathing through the night,\r\n    Her breathing soft and low,\r\n  As in her breast the wave of life\r\n    Kept heaving to and fro. HOOD.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n  Softly, peacefully,\r\n    Lay her to rest;\r\n  Place the turf lightly,\r\n    On her young breast. D.E. GOODMAN.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n  The loud wind dwindled to a whisper low,\r\n  And sighed for pity as it answered,--"No."\r\n\r\n2. A MIDDLE TONE, or medium loudness of voice, is employed in reading\r\n_narrative_, _descriptive_, or _didactic sentences_.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n  I love my country\'s pine-clad hills,\r\n  Her thousand bright and gushing rills,\r\n    Her sunshine and her storms;\r\n  Her rough and rugged rocks that rear\r\n  Their hoary heads high in the air,\r\n    In wild fantastic forms.\r\n\r\n3. A LOUD TONE, or fullness and stress of voice, is used in expressing\r\n_violent passions_ and _vehement emotions_.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1.\r\n  STAND! _the ground\'s your own_, my braves,--\r\n  Will ye give it up to _slaves_?\r\n  Will ye look for _greener graves_?\r\n      Hope ye mercy still?\r\n  What\'s the mercy _despots_ feel?\r\n  Hear it in that _battle-peal_,--\r\n  Read it on yon bristling steel,\r\n      Ask it--_ye who will!_ PIERPONT.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n  "HOLD!" Tyranny cries; but their resolute breath\r\n  Sends back the reply: "INDEPENDENCE or DEATH!"\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALITY.\r\n\r\nQUALITY has reference to _the kind of sound_ uttered.\r\n\r\nTwo sounds may be alike in quantity and pitch, yet differ in quality.\r\nThe sounds produced on the clarinet and flute may agree in pitch and\r\nquantity, yet be unlike in quality. The same is true in regard to the\r\ntones of the voice of two individuals. This difference is occasioned\r\nmainly by the different positions of the vocal organs.\r\n\r\nThe qualities of voice mostly used in reading or speaking, and which\r\nshould receive the highest degree of culture, are the _Pure Tone_, the\r\n_Orotund_, the _Aspirated_, and the _Guttural_.\r\n\r\nRULES FOR QUALITY.\r\n\r\n1. THE PURE TONE is a clear, smooth, sonorous flow of sound, usually\r\naccompanied with the middle pitch of voice, and is adapted to express\r\nemotions of _joy, cheerfulness, love_, and _tranquillity_.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n  Hail! beauteous stranger of the wood,\r\n    Attendant on the spring,\r\n  Now heaven repairs thy vernal seat,\r\n    And woods thy welcome sing.\r\n\r\n2. THE OROTUND is a full, deep, round, and pure tone of voice,\r\npeculiarly adapted in expressing _sublime_ and _pathetic emotions_.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n  It thunders! Sons of dust, in reverence bow!\r\n  Ancient of Days! Thou speakest from above:\r\n  Almighty! trembling, like a timid child,\r\n  I hear thy awful voice. Alarmed--afraid--\r\n  I see the flashes of thy lightning wild,\r\n  And in the very grave would hide my head.\r\n\r\n3. THE ASPIRATED TONE of voice is not a pure, vocal sound, but rather a\r\nforcible breathing utterance, and is used to express _amazement, fear,\r\nterror, anger, revenge, remorse_, and _fervent emotions_.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n  Oh, coward conscience, how dost thou affright me!\r\n  The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight;\r\n  Cold, fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.\r\n\r\n4. THE GUTTURAL QUALITY is a deep, aspirated tone of voice, used to\r\nexpress _aversion, hatred, loathing_, and _contempt_.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n  Tell me I _hate_ the bowl?\r\n    HATE is a feeble word:\r\n  I _loathe_, ABHOR, my very soul\r\n   With strong disgust is stirred,\r\n  Whene\'er I see, or hear, or tell,\r\n    Of the dark beverage of hell.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTATION IN MODULATION.\r\n\r\n  (o) high.\r\n  (oo) high and loud.\r\n  ([o]) low.\r\n  ([oo]) low and loud.\r\n  (=) quick.\r\n  (_\'\'_) short and quick.\r\n  (_sl_.) slow.\r\n  (_p_.) soft.\r\n  (_pp_.) very soft.\r\n  (_f_.) loud.\r\n  (_ff_.) very loud.\r\n  (_pl_.) plaintive.\r\n  (<) increase.\r\n  (>) decrease.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES FOR EXERCISE IN MODULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n   (_p_.)

To this end, it will be found\r\nvery advantageous, occasionally to review the rules and directions given\r\nin the preceding pages, and thus early accustom him to apply them in the\r\nsubsequent reading lessons. For a wider range of examples and\r\nillustrations, it is only necessary to refer to the numerous and various\r\nexercises which form the body of this book.

I shall never forget a lesson which I received when quite a young\r\nlad, while attending an Academy. Among my schoolmates were Hartly and\r\nVincent. They were both older than myself, and Vincent was looked up to,\r\nas a sort of leader in matters of opinion, and in directing our sports.\r\n\r\n2. He was not, at heart, a malicious boy; but he had a foolish ambition\r\nof being thought witty and sarcastic; and he made himself feared by a\r\nhabit of turning things into ridicule. He seemed to be constantly\r\nlooking out for something to occur, which he could turn into derision.\r\n\r\n3. Hartly was a new scholar, and little was known of him among the boys.\r\nOne morning as we were on our way to school, he was seen driving a cow\r\nalong the road toward the pasture. A group of boys, among whom was\r\nVincent, met him as he was passing.\r\n\r\n4. "Now," said Vincent, "let us have a little sport with our country\r\nrustic." So saying, he exclaimed: "Halloo, Jonathan! [Footnote: A title\r\nfrequently applied to the Yankees by the English.] what is the price of\r\nmilk? What do you feed her on? What will you take for all the gold on\r\nher horns? Boys, if you want to see the latest Paris style, look at\r\nthose boots!"\r\n\r\n5. Hartly waved his hand at us with a pleasant smile, and, driving the\r\ncow to the field, took down the bars of a rail-fence, saw her safely in\r\nthe pasture, and then, putting up the bars, came and entered the school\r\nwith the rest of us. After school, in the afternoon, he let out the cow,\r\nand drove her away, none of us knew where. Every day, for two or three\r\nweeks, he went through the same task.\r\n\r\n6. The boys who attended the Academy, were nearly all the sons of\r\nwealthy parents, and some of them were foolish enough to look down, with\r\na sort of disdain, upon a scholar who had to drive a cow to pasture; and\r\nthe sneers and jeers of Vincent were often repeated.\r\n\r\n7. One day, he refused to sit next to Hartly in school, on a pretense\r\nthat he did not like the odor of the barn. Sometimes he would inquire of\r\nHartly after the cow\'s health, pronouncing the word "ke-ow," after the\r\nmanner of some people.\r\n\r\n8. Hartly bore all these silly attempts to wound his feelings and annoy\r\nhim, with the utmost good nature. He never once returned an angry look\r\nor word. One time, Vincent said: "Hartly, I suppose your father intends\r\nto make a milkman of you."\r\n\r\n9. "Why not?" said Hartly. "Oh, nothing," said Vincent; "only do not\r\nleave much water in the cans after rinsing them--that\'s all!" The boys\r\nlaughed, and Hartly, not in the least mortified, replied: "Never fear;\r\nif I ever rise to be a milkman, I will give _good measure_ and _good\r\nmilk_ too."\r\n\r\n10. A few days after this conversation, there was a public exhibition,\r\nat which a number of ladies and gentlemen from the city, was present.\r\nPrizes were awarded by the Principal of the Academy, and Hartly and\r\nVincent each received one; for, in respect to scholarship, they were\r\nabout equal.\r\n\r\n11. After the prizes were distributed, the Principal remarked that there\r\nwas _one prize_, consisting of a medal, which was _rarely_ awarded, not\r\nso much on account of its great value, as because the instances are\r\n_rare_ that merit it. It is THE PRIZE FOR HEROISM. The last boy on whom\r\nit was conferred, was Master Manners, who, three years ago, rescued the\r\nblind girl from drowning.\r\n\r\n12. The Principal then said, "With the permission of the company, I will\r\nrelate a short story. Not long since, some boys were flying a kite in\r\nthe street, just as a poor boy on horseback rode by, on his way to mill.\r\nThe horse took fright, and threw the boy, injuring him so badly that he\r\nwas carried home, and confined for some weeks to his bed.\r\n\r\n13. "None of the boys who had caused the disaster, followed to learn the\r\nfate of the wounded boy. There was one, however, who witnessed the\r\naccident from a distance, and went to render what service he could. He\r\nsoon learned that the wounded boy was the grandson of a poor widow,\r\nwhose only support consisted in selling the milk of a fine cow, of which\r\nshe was the owner.\r\n\r\n14. "Alas! what could she now do? She was old and lame, and her\r\ngrandson, on whom she depended to drive the cow to pasture, was now sick\r\nand helpless. \'Never mind, good woman,\' said the boy, \'I can drive your\r\ncow.\' With thanks, the poor widow accepted his offer.\r\n\r\n15. "But the boy\'s kindness did not stop here. Money was wanted to\r\npurchase medicine. \'I have money that my mother sent me to buy a pair of\r\nboots,\' said the boy; \'but I can do without them for the present.\'\r\n\r\n16. "\'Oh, no!\' said the old lady, \'I can not consent to that; but here\r\nis a pair of cowhide boots that I bought for Henry, who can not wear\r\nthem. If you will buy them, giving me what they cost, I can get along\r\nvery well.\' The boy bought the boots, clumsy as they were, and has worn\r\nthem up to this time.\r\n\r\n17. "When the other boys of the Academy saw this scholar driving a cow\r\nto the pasture, he was assailed with laughter and ridicule. His thick\r\ncowhide boots, in particular, were made matters of mirth. But he kept on\r\ncheerfully and bravely, day after day, driving the widow\'s cow to the\r\npasture, and wearing his thick boots, contented in the thought that he\r\nwas _doing right_, not caring for all the jeers and sneers that could be\r\nuttered.\r\n\r\n18. "He never undertook to explain why he drove the cow; for he was not\r\ninclined to display his charitable motives, and besides, in heart, he\r\nhad no sympathy with the false pride that looks with ridicule on any\r\nuseful employment. It was by _mere accident_ that his course of conduct\r\nand self-denial, was yesterday discovered by his teacher.\r\n\r\n19. "And now, ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to you. Was there not _true\r\nheroism_ in this boy\'s conduct? Nay, Master Hartly, do not steal out of\r\nsight behind the blackboard! You were not ashamed of _ridicule_--you\r\nmust not shun _praise. Come forth, come forth, Master Edward James\r\nHartly, and let us see your honest face!_"\r\n\r\n20. As Hartly, with blushing cheeks, made his appearance, the whole\r\ncompany greeted him with a round of applause for his _heroic conduct_.\r\nThe ladies stood upon benches, and waved their handkerchiefs. The old\r\nmen clapped their hands, and wiped the moisture from the corners of\r\ntheir eyes. Those clumsy boots on Hartly\'s feet seemed prouder\r\nornaments, than a crown would have been on his head. The medal was\r\nbestowed on him, amid the applause of the whole company.\r\n\r\n21. Vincent was heartily ashamed of his ill-natured sneers, and, after\r\nthe school was dismissed, he went, with tears in his eyes, and tendered\r\nhis hand to Hartly, making a handsome apology for his past ill manners.\r\n"Think no more about it," said Hartly; "let us all go and have a ramble\r\nin the woods, before we break up for vacation." The boys, one and all,\r\nfollowed Vincent\'s example, and then, with shouts and huzzas, they all\r\nset forth into the woods--a happy, cheerful group.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

Many years ago, dining the early settlements in New England, the\r\nchildren were accustomed to gather large quantities of nuts, which grew\r\nin great abundance in the forests that surrounded their little\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\n2. In one of these nut-gatherings, a little boy and girl, the one eight\r\nand the other four years of age, whose mother was dead, became separated\r\nfrom their companions. On their way home, they came across some wild\r\ngrapes, and were busily engaged in gathering them, till the last rays of\r\nthe setting sun were fading away.\r\n\r\n3. Suddenly they were seized by two Indians. The boy struggled\r\nviolently, and his little sister cried to him for protection; but in\r\nvain. The Indians soon bore them far beyond the bounds of the\r\nsettlement. Night was far advanced before they halted. Then they kindled\r\na fire, and offered the children some food.\r\n\r\n4. The heart of the boy swelled high with grief and anger, and he\r\nrefused to eat. But the poor little girl took some parched corn from the\r\nhand of the Indian who held her on his knee. He smiled as he saw her eat\r\nthe kernels, and look up in his face with a wondering, yet reproachful\r\neye. Then they lay down to sleep in the dark forest, each with an arm\r\nover his little captive.\r\n\r\n5. Great was the alarm in the colony when these children did not return.\r\nEvery spot was searched, where it was thought possible they might have\r\nlost their way. But when, at length, their little basket was found,\r\noverturned in a tangled thicket, they came to the conclusion that they\r\nmust have been captured by the Indians.\r\n\r\n6. It was decided that before any warlike measures were adopted, the\r\nfather should go peacefully to the Indian king, and demand his children.\r\nAt the earliest dawn of morning he departed with his companions. They\r\nmet a friendly Indian pursuing the chase, who consented to be their\r\nguide.\r\n\r\n7. They traveled through rude paths, until the day drew near a close.\r\nThen, approaching a circle of native dwellings, in the midst of which\r\nwas a tent, they saw a man of lofty form, with a coronet of feathers\r\nupon his brow, and surrounded by warriors. The guide saluted him as his\r\nmonarch, and the bereaved father, bowing down, thus addressed him:\r\n\r\n8. "King of the red men, thou seest a father in pursuit of his lost\r\nchildren. He has heard that your people will not harm the stranger in\r\ndistress. So he trusts himself fearlessly among you. The king of our own\r\nnative land, who should have protected us, became our foe. We fled from\r\nour dear homes--from the graves of our fathers.\r\n\r\n9. "The ocean wave brought us to this New World. We are a peaceful race,\r\npure from the blood of all men. We seek to take the hand of our red\r\nbrethren. Of my own kindred, none inhabit this wilderness, save two\r\nlittle buds, from a broken, buried stem.\r\n\r\n10. "Last night, sorrow entered into my soul, because I found them not.\r\nKnowest thou, O king, if thy people have taken my children\'? Knowest\r\nthou where they have concealed them\'? Cause them, I pray thee, to be\r\nrestored to my arms. So shall the Great Spirit bless thy own tender\r\nplants, and lift up thy heart when it weigheth heavily on they bosom."\r\n\r\n11. The Indian monarch, fixing on him a piercing glance, said: "Knowest\r\nthou me\'? Look in my eyes`! Look`! Answer me`! Are they the eyes of a\r\nstranger`!" The bereaved father replied that he had no recollection of\r\nhaving ever before seen his countenance.\r\n\r\n12. "Thus it is with the white man. He is dim-eyed. He looketh on the\r\n_garments_ more than on the _soul_. Where your plows turn up the earth,\r\noft have I stood watching your toil. There was no coronet on my brow.\r\nBut I was king. And you knew it not.\r\n\r\n13. "I looked upon your people. I saw neither pride nor violence. I went\r\nan _enemy_, but returned a _friend_. I said to my warriors, \'Do these\r\nmen no harm. They do not hate Indians.\' Then our white-haired prophet of\r\nthe Great Spirit rebuked me. He bade me make no league with the pale\r\nfaces, lest angry words should be spoken of me, among the shades of our\r\nburied kings.\r\n\r\n14. "Yet, again, I went where thy brethren have reared their dwellings.\r\nYes; I entered thy house. _And thou knowest not this brow\'?_ I could\r\ntell _thine_ at midnight, if but a single star trembled through the\r\nclouds. My ear would know _thy_ voice, though the storm was abroad with\r\nall its thunders.\r\n\r\n15. "I have said that I was king. Yet I came to thee hungry, and thou\r\ngavest me bread. My head was wet with the tempest. Thou badest me lie\r\ndown on thy couch, and thy son, for whom thou mournest, covered me.\r\n\r\n16. "I was sad in spirit, and thy little daughter, whom thou seekest\r\nwith tears, sat on my knee. She smiled when I told her how the beaver\r\nbuildeth his house in the forest. My heart was comforted, for I saw that\r\nshe did not hate Indians.\r\n\r\n17. "Turn not on me such a terrible eye. I am no stealer of babes. I\r\nhave reproved the people who took thy children. I have sheltered them\r\nfor thee. Not a hair of their head is hurt. Thinkest thou that the red\r\nman can forget kindness\'? They are sleeping in my tent. Had I but a\r\nsingle blanket, it should have been their bed. Take them, and return\r\nunto thy people."\r\n\r\n18. He waved his hand to an attendant, and, in a moment, the two\r\nchildren were in the arms of their father. The white men were kindly\r\nsheltered for that night, and, the next day, they bore the children to\r\ntheir home, and the people rejoiced at their safe return.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

E. OAKES SMITH.\r\n\r\n1. I was but five years old when my mother died; but her image is as\r\nfresh in my mind, now that twenty years have elapsed, as it was at the\r\ntime of her death. I remember her, as a pale, gentle being, with a sweet\r\nsmile, and a voice soft and cheerful when she praised me; and when I had\r\nerred, (for I was a wild, thoughtless child,) there was a mild and\r\ntender earnestness in her reproofs, that always went to my little heart.\r\n\r\n2. Methinks I can now see her large, blue eyes moist with sorrow,\r\nbecause of my childish waywardness, and hear her repeat: "My child, how\r\ncan you grieve me so?" She had, for a long time, been pale and feeble,\r\nand sometimes there would come a bright spot on her cheek, which made\r\nher look so lovely, I thought she must be well. But then she spoke of\r\ndying, and pressed me to her bosom, and told me to be good when she was\r\ngone, and to love my father, and be kind to him; for he would have no\r\none else to love.\r\n\r\n3. I recollect she was ill all day, and my little hobbyhorse and whip\r\nwere laid aside, and I tried to be very quiet. I did not see her for the\r\nwhole day, and it seemed very long. At night, they told me my mother was\r\ntoo sick to kiss me, as she always had done before I went to bed, and I\r\nmust go without it. But I could not. I stole into the room, and placing\r\nmy lips close to hers, whispered: "Mother, dear mother, won\'t you kiss\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n4. Her lips were very cold, and when she put her hand upon my cheek, and\r\nlaid my head on her bosom, I felt a cold shuddering pass all through me.\r\nMy father carried me from the room; but he could not speak. After they\r\nput me in bed, I lay a long while thinking; I feared my mother would,\r\nindeed, die; for her cheek felt cold, as my little sister\'s did when she\r\ndied, and they carried her little body away where I never saw it again.\r\nBut I soon fell asleep.\r\n\r\n5. In the morning I rushed to my mother\'s room, with a strange dread of\r\nevil to come upon me. It was just as I feared. A white linen covered her\r\nstraight, cold form. I removed it from her face: her eyes were closed,\r\nand her cheeks were hard and cold. But my mother\'s dear, dear smile was\r\nthere, or my heart would have broken.\r\n\r\n6. In an instant, all the little faults, for which she had so often\r\nreproved me, rushed upon my mind. I longed to tell her how good I would\r\nalways be, if she would but stay with me. I longed to tell her how, in\r\nall time to come, her words would be a law to me. I would be all that\r\nshe had wished me to be.\r\n\r\n7. I was a passionate, headstrong boy; and never did this frame of\r\ntemper come upon me, but I seemed to see her mild, tearful eyes full\r\nupon me, just as she used to look in life; and when I strove for the\r\nmastery over my passions, her smile seemed to cheer my heart, and I was\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\n8. My whole character underwent a change, even from the moment of her\r\ndeath. Her spirit seemed to be always with me, _to aid the good_ and\r\n_root out the evil_ that was in me. I felt it would grieve her gentle\r\nspirit to see me err, and I _could not_, _would not_, do so.\r\n\r\n9. I was the child of her affection. I knew she had prayed and wept over\r\nme; and that even on the threshold of the grave, her anxiety for my\r\nwelfare had caused her spirit to linger, that she might pray once more\r\nfor me. I never forgot my mother\'s last kiss. It was with me in sorrow;\r\nit was with me in joy; it was with me in moments of evil, like a\r\nperpetual good.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

E. OAKES SMITH.\r\n\r\n1. "Dear mother, here\'s the _very_ place\r\n     Where little John was found,\r\n   The water covering up his face,\r\n     His feet upon the ground.\r\n   Now won\'t you tell me _all about_\r\n     The death of little John\'?\r\n   And how the woman sent him out\r\n     Long after sun was down\'?\r\n   And tell me _all about the wrong_,\r\n     And _that_ will make the story long."\r\n\r\n2. I took the child upon my knee\r\n     Beside the lake so clear;\r\n   For _there_ the tale of misery\r\n     Young Edward begged to hear\r\n   He looked into my _very_ eyes,\r\n     With sad and earnest face,\r\n   And caught his breath with wild surprise,\r\n     And turned to mark the place\r\n   Where _perished_, years agone, the child\r\n   Alone, beneath the waters wild.\r\n\r\n3.   "A weakly orphan boy was John,\r\n        A barefoot, stinted child,\r\n     Whose work-day task was never done,\r\n       Who wept when others smiled.\r\n     Around his home the trees were high,\r\n       Down to the water\'s brink,\r\n     And almost hid the pleasant sky,\r\n       Where wild deer came to drink."\r\n(\'\') "And did they come, the pretty deer\'?\r\n      And did they drink the water here\'?"\r\n\r\n4. Cried Edward, with a wondering eye:\r\n     "Now, mother, tell to me,\r\n   Was John about as _large_ as I\'?\r\n     Pray tell, how _big_ was he\'?"\r\n   "He was an _older_ boy than _you_,\r\n     And _stouter_ every way;\r\n   For, water from the well he drew,\r\n     And hard he worked all day.\r\n   But then poor John was sharp and thin,\r\n   With sun-burnt hair and sun-burnt skin.\r\n\r\n5. "His mother used to spin and weave;\r\n    From farm to farm she went;\r\n  And, though it made her much to grieve,\r\n    She John to service sent.\r\n  He lived with one, a woman stern,\r\n    Of hard and cruel ways;\r\n  And he must bring her wood to burn,\r\n    From forest and highways;\r\n  And then, at night, on cold, hard bed,\r\n  He laid his little, aching head.\r\n\r\n6. "The weary boy had toiled all day\r\n    With heavy spade and hoe;\r\n  His mistress met him on the way,\r\n    And bade him quickly go\r\n  And bring her home some sticks of wood,\r\n    For she would bake and brew;\r\n  When he returned, she\'d give him food;\r\n    For she had much to do.\r\n  And then she charged him not to stay,\r\n  Nor loiter long upon the way.\r\n\r\n7. "He went; but scarce his toil-worn feet\r\n    Could crawl along the wood,\r\n  He was so spent with work and heat,\r\n    And faint for lack of food.\r\n  He bent his aching, little back\r\n    To bear the weight along,\r\n  And staggered then upon the track;\r\n    For John was _never_ strong;\r\n  His eyesight, too, began to fail,\r\n  And he grew giddy, faint, and pale.\r\n\r\n8. "The load was small, _quite_ small, \'tis true,\r\n    But John could bring no more;\r\n   The woman in a rage it threw,--\r\n    She stamped upon the floor.\r\n(_f_.) \'No supper you shall have to-night;\r\n    So go along to bed,\r\n   You good-for-nothing, ugly fright,\r\n    You little stupid-head!\'"\r\n   Said Edward: "_I_ would _never_ go;\r\n   She wouldn\'t _dare_ to serve _me_ so!"\r\n\r\n9. "The moon-beams fell upon the child\r\n     As, weeping, there he lay;\r\n   And gusty winds were sweeping wild\r\n     Along the forest way,\r\n   When up rose John, at dead of night;\r\n     For he would see his mother;\r\n   _She_ loved her child, although _he_ might\r\n     Be _nothing_ to another.\r\n   That narrow creek he forded o\'er,--\r\n   \'Tis nearer than around the shore.\r\n\r\n10. "But here the shore is rough, you see;\r\n    The bank is high and steep;\r\n   And John, who climbed on hands and knee,\r\n    His footing could not keep.\r\n   He backward fell, all, all alone;\r\n    Too weak was he to rise;\r\n(_pl._) And no one heard his dying moan,\r\n    Or closed his dying eyes.\r\n   How still he slept! And grief and pain\r\n   Could never come to him again.\r\n\r\n11. "A stranger, passing on his way,\r\n      Found him, as you have said;\r\n    His feet were out upon the clay,\r\n      The water o\'er his head.\r\n    And then his foot-prints showed the path\r\n      He took, adown the creek,\r\n    When he escaped the woman\'s wrath,\r\n      So hungry, faint, and weak.\r\n    And people now, as you have heard,\r\n      Do call the place, THE DEAD CHILD\'S FORD."\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

Two beggars, LAME and LAZY, were in want of bread. _One_ leaned on\r\nhis crutch, the _other_ reclined on his couch. Lame called on Charity,\r\nand humbly asked for a _cracker_. Instead of a cracker, he received a\r\n_loaf_.\r\n\r\n2. Lazy, seeing the gift of Charity, exclaimed: "What`! ask a _cracker_\r\nand receive a _loaf\'_? Well, I will ask a loaf." Lazy now applied to\r\nCharity, and called for a loaf of bread. "Your demanding a loaf," said\r\nCharity, "proves you a _loaf_-er. You are of that class and character\r\nwho _ask_ and _receive not_; because you ask amiss."\r\n\r\n3. Lazy, who always found fault, and had rather whine than work,\r\ncomplained of _ill-treatment_, and even accused Charity of a breach of\r\nan exceeding great and precious promise: "Ask, and ye shall receive."\r\n\r\n4. Charity pointed him to a painting in her room, which presented to his\r\nvision three personages, Faith, Hope and Charity. Charity appeared\r\nlarger and fairer than her sisters. He noticed that her right hand held\r\na pot of honey, which fed a bee disabled, having lost its wings. Her\r\nleft hand was armed with a whip to keep off the drones.\r\n\r\n5. "I do not understand it," said Lazy. Charity replied: "It means that\r\nCharity _feeds_ the lame, and _flogs_ the lazy." Lazy turned to go.\r\n"Stop," said Charity, "instead of _coin_, I will give you _counsel_. Do\r\nnot go and live on your poor mother; I will send you to a _rich ant_."\r\n\r\n6. "_Rich aunt\'_?" echoed Lazy. "Where shall I find her\'?" "You will\r\nfind a description of her," replied Charity, "in Proverbs, sixth\r\nchapter, sixth, seventh, and eighth verses, which read as follows: \'Go\r\nto the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise; which, having\r\nno guide, overseer, or ruler, provided her meat in summer, and gathereth\r\nher food in the harvest.\'"\r\n\r\n7.

CHASE.\r\n\r\n1. "Is Mr. Harris in\'?" inquired a plainly, but neatly dressed boy,\r\ntwelve or thirteen years of age, of a clerk, as he stood by the counter\r\nof a large bookstore.\r\n\r\nThe clerk regarded the boy with a haughty look, and answered: "Mr.\r\nHarris is in; but he is engaged."\r\n\r\n2. The boy looked at the clerk hesitatingly, and then said: "If he is\r\nnot particularly engaged, I would like to see him."\r\n\r\n"If you have any business to transact, _I_ can attend to it," replied\r\nthe clerk. "Mr. Harris can not be troubled with boys like you."\r\n\r\n3. "What is this, Mr. Morley?" said a pleasant-looking man, stepping up\r\nto the clerk; "what does the boy want?"\r\n\r\n"He insisted on seeing you, though I told him you were engaged,"\r\nreturned the clerk, a little abashed by the manner of his employer.\r\n\r\n4. "And what do you wish to see me about, my lad?" inquired Mr. Harris,\r\nkindly.\r\n\r\nThe boy raised his eyes, and, meeting the scornful glance of the clerk,\r\nsaid timidly: "I wish you to look at the bill of some books which I\r\nbought here, about three months since. There is a mistake in it, which I\r\nwish to correct."\r\n\r\n5. "Ah, my boy, I see," replied Mr. Harris; "you have _overpaid_ us, I\r\nsuppose!"\r\n\r\n"No, sir," answered the boy. "On the contrary, I purchased some books\r\nwhich are _not charged_ in the bill, and I have called to pay for them."\r\n\r\n6. Mr. Harris looked at the boy earnestly for a moment, and then asked:\r\n"When did you discover this mistake?"\r\n\r\n"Not until I reached home," replied the lad. "When I paid for the books\r\nI was in a great hurry, fearing the boat would leave before I could\r\nreach it, and I did not examine the bill."\r\n\r\n7. "Why did you not return before, and rectify the mistake?" asked the\r\ngentleman, in a tone slightly altered.\r\n\r\n"Because, sir, I live some distance from the city, and have not been\r\nable to return till now."\r\n\r\n8. "My dear boy," said Mr. Harris, "you have given me great pleasure. In\r\na long life of mercantile business, I have never met with an instance of\r\nthis kind before. You have _acted nobly_ and deserve a recompense."\r\n\r\n"I ask no recompense," returned the boy. "_I have done nothing but my\r\nduty_--a simple act of justice, and that deserves no reward, but\r\nitself."\r\n\r\n9. "May I ask who taught you such noble principles\'?" inquired Mr.\r\nHarris.\r\n\r\n"My mother\'," answered the boy, bursting into tears.\r\n\r\n10. "Blessed is the child who has such a mother," said Mr. Harris, "and\r\nblessed is the mother of such a child. Be faithful to her teachings, my\r\ndear boy, and you will be the staff of her declining years."\r\n\r\n"Alas, sir," said the boy, "my mother is dead! It was her sickness and\r\ndeath which prevented me from coming here before."\r\n\r\n11. "What is your name?" inquired Mr. Harris.\r\n\r\n"Edward Delong."\r\n\r\n"Have you a father living\'?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. My father died when I was an infant."\r\n\r\n12. "Where do you reside?"\r\n\r\n"In the town of Linwood, about fifty miles from this city."\r\n\r\n"Well, my boy, what are the books which were forgotten?"\r\n\r\n"Tacitus and a Latin Dictionary."\r\n\r\n13. "Let me see the bill. Ha! signed by A. C. Morley. I will see to\r\nthat. Here, Mr. Morley!" called Mr. Harris; but the clerk was busily\r\nengaged in waiting on a customer at the opposite side of the store,\r\nbowing and smiling in the most attentive manner.\r\n\r\n14. "Edward," continued Mr. Harris, "I am not going to _reward_ you for\r\nwhat you have done; but I wish to manifest my approbation of your\r\nconduct in such a manner, as to make you remember the wise and excellent\r\nprecepts of your departed mother. Select from my store any ten books you\r\nchoose, which, in addition to the two you had before, shall be a\r\n_present_ to you; and henceforth, as now, my boy, remember and not\r\n\'despise the day of small things.\' If ever you need a friend, call on\r\nme, and I will assist you."\r\n\r\n15. The grateful boy thanked his kind benefactor, and, with tears in his\r\neyes, bowed and left the store.\r\n\r\nEdward Delong wished for knowledge, and, though the scanty means left\r\nhim by his mother, could hardly satisfy his desire, by diligence and\r\neconomy he had advanced far beyond most boys of his age. By working\r\nnights and mornings for a neighbor, he had amassed, what seemed to him,\r\na large sum of money, and this was expended in books.\r\n\r\n16. Edward\'s home was now with a man who regarded money as the chief end\r\nand aim of life, and severe and constant physical labor as the only\r\nmeans of obtaining that end. For two years Edward struggled with his\r\nhopeless condition, toiling early and late to obtain a livelihood.\r\n\r\n17. Edward now resolved to go to the city, to seek some employment,\r\nbetter adapted to promote his education. He entered the same store where\r\nhe purchased the books, and inquired for Mr. Harris.\r\n\r\n"He is engaged," replied the polite clerk. "If you will wait a moment,\r\nhe will be at liberty."\r\n\r\n18. "Did you wish to see me?" asked Mr. Harris of the boy, whose\r\nthoughts were so intense that he had not noticed the approach of his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Harris!" exclaimed Edward, and it was all he could say. For the\r\nremembrance of past favors bestowed on him by his kind benefactor, so\r\nfilled his heart with gratitude, that further utterance was denied.\r\n\r\n"My noble Edward!" said the old gentleman. "And so you needed a friend.\r\nWell, you shall have one."\r\n\r\n19. Five years from that time, Edward Delong was the confidential clerk\r\nof Mr. Harris, and, in three more, a partner in the firm. The integrity\r\nof purpose, which first won the regard of his benefactor, was his guide\r\nin after life. Prosperity crowned his efforts, and happiness blessed his\r\nheart,--the never-failing result of _faithfulness in little things_.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

Within twenty years from the foundation of our village\', [Footnote:\r\nCooperstown, New York.] the deer had already become scarce\', and\', in a\r\nbrief period later\', they had almost entirely fled from the country`.\r\nOne of the last of these beautiful creatures, a pretty little fawn, had\r\nbeen brought in from the woods, when it was very young, and had been\r\nnursed and petted by a young lady in the village, until it became\r\ncompletely domesticated.\r\n\r\n2. It was graceful, as those little creatures always are, and so gentle\r\nand playful that it became a great favorite. Following the different\r\nmembers of the family about, it was caressed and welcomed everywhere.\r\nOne morning, after gamboling about as usual, until weary, it threw\r\nitself down in the sunshine, at the feet of one of its friends, upon the\r\ndoor-step of a store.\r\n\r\n3. There came along a countryman, who, for several years, had been a\r\nhunter by pursuit, and who still kept several hounds, one of which came\r\nto the village with him, on this occasion. The dog, as it approached the\r\nplace where the fawn lay, suddenly stopped; the little animal saw him,\r\nand darted to its feet.\r\n\r\n4. It had lived more than half its life among the villagers, and had\r\napparently lost all fear of them; but it now seemed to know\r\ninstinctively that an enemy was at hand. In an instant, its whole\r\ncharacter and appearance seemed changed; all its past habits were\r\nforgotten; every wild impulse was awake; its head erect, its nostrils\r\ndilated, its eyes flashing.\r\n\r\n5. In another instant, before the spectators had thought of the danger,\r\nand before its friends could secure it, the fawn was leaping wildly\r\nthrough the street, and the hound in full chase. The by-standers were\r\neager to save it; several persons instantly followed its track; the\r\nfriends who had long fed and fondled it, were calling the name it had\r\nhitherto known; but, in vain.\r\n\r\n6. The hunter endeavored to call back his dog; but, with no better\r\nsuccess. In half a minute, the fawn had turned the first corner, dashed\r\nonward toward the lake, and thrown itself into the water. But, if, for a\r\nmoment, the startled creature believed itself safe in the lake, it was\r\nsoon undeceived; for the hound followed in hot and eager chase, while a\r\ndozen village dogs joined in the pursuit.\r\n\r\n7. A large crowd collected on the bank--men, women, and\r\nchildren,--anxious for the fate of the little animal. Some threw\r\nthemselves into boats, hoping to intercept the hound before he reached\r\nhis prey. But the splashing of the oars, the voices of men and boys, and\r\nthe barking of the dogs, must have filled the beating heart of the poor\r\nfawn with terror and anguish; as if every creature on the spot where it\r\nhad once been caressed and fondled, had suddenly turned into a deadly\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\n8. It was soon seen that the fawn was directing its course across a bay,\r\ntoward the nearest borders of the forest. Immediately the owner of the\r\nhound crossed the bridge, ran at full speed in the same direction,\r\nhoping to stop his dog as he landed. On swam the fawn, as it had never\r\nswam before; its delicate head scarcely seen above the water, but\r\nleaving a disturbed track which betrayed its course alike to anxious\r\nfriends and fierce enemies.\r\n\r\n9. As it approached the land, the interest became intense. The hunter\r\nwas already on the same side of the lake, calling loudly and angrily to\r\nhis dog; but the animal seemed to have quite forgotten his master\'s\r\nvoice in the pitiless pursuit. The fawn touched the land; in one leap,\r\nit had crossed the narrow piece of beach, and, in another instant, it\r\nwould reach the cover of the woods.\r\n\r\n10. The hound followed true to the scent, aiming at the same spot on the\r\nshore. His master, anxious to meet him, had run at full speed, and was\r\nnow coming up at the same critical moment. Would the dog listen to his\r\nvoice? Could the hunter reach him in time to seize and control him? A\r\nshout from the spectators proclaimed that the fawn had passed out of\r\nsight into the forest. At the same instant, the hound, as he touched the\r\nland, felt the hunter\'s strong arm clutching his neck.\r\n\r\n11. The worst was believed to be over; the fawn was leaping up the\r\nmountain-side, and its enemy restrained. The other dogs, seeing their\r\nleader cowed, were easily managed. A number of men and boys dispersed\r\nthemselves through the wood in search of the little creature; but,\r\nwithout success. They all returned to the village, reporting that the\r\nanimal had not been seen by them. Some persons thought that, after its\r\nfright had passed over, it would return of its own accord.\r\n\r\n12. It wore a pretty collar with its owner\'s name engraved upon it, so\r\nthat it could be easily known from any other fawn, that might be\r\nstraying about the woods. Before many hours had passed, a hunter\r\npresented himself before the lady, whose pet the little creature had\r\nbeen, and showed a collar with her name upon it. He said that he was out\r\nhunting in the morning, and saw a fawn in the distance. The little\r\ncreature, instead of bounding away as he expected, moved toward him. He\r\ntook aim, fired, and shot it to the heart.\r\n\r\n13. When he found the collar about its neck, he was very sorry he had\r\nkilled it. One would have thought that that terrible chase would have\r\nmade it afraid of man; but no; _it forgot the evil_, and _remembered the\r\nkindness only_; and came to meet, as a friend, the hunter who shot it.\r\nIt was long mourned by its best friend.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. Where did the lady reside who kept this pet fawn? 2. Is\r\nthere a lake near that village? 3. What river rises in that lake? 4.\r\nDescribe the chase of the pet fawn. 5. How came it to be shot? 6.

Not _man_ alone, but _every thing_ in nature, owns its influence. I\r\nknew a little flower that sprang up amidst the weeds and brambles of a\r\nlong-neglected garden; but soon drooped its slender stem, and its leaves\r\ngrew tinged from the waste around.\r\n\r\n2. I took it to my home, supported its drooping stem, and placed it\r\nwhere the warm sunshine and refreshing showers cheered its little life.\r\nAgain it raised its beautiful head, and its delicate buds burst forth in\r\ngladness; and when the winds of autumn came, the dying flower gave up to\r\nme its golden seeds--a thankful tribute for my love. \'Twas a little\r\nthing, but _kindness_ did the deed.\r\n\r\n3. There came to my casement, one winter\'s morning, a shivering,\r\nstarving bird, and perched itself there, striving to tell its tale of\r\nsuffering; but feeble were its plaintive notes, and its glossy breast\r\nwas ruffled in the blast. I raised the window. Affrighted, the little\r\nwanderer spread its wings, as if to soar away; but, weak and faint, it\r\nsank fluttering in my outstretched hands. I drew it in. Alarmed, it\r\ndarted round and round the room, and beat against the frosted pane. _O\r\nCruelty! thou hast taught even the little birds to doubt!_\r\n\r\n4. When the little stranger grew less timid, I gave it clear water, and\r\ntempting food, and so, for many weeks, we dwelt together; but when came\r\nthe first warm, sunny day, I opened my doors, and it flew away,--_away\r\nup, up_ into the dark-blue heavens, till it was lost to my eager gaze.\r\n\r\n5. But not an hour had passed, ere I heard the flutter of its tiny\r\nwings, and saw, without, its little breast glittering in the golden\r\nsunbeams. It had a joyous life. No wired cage restrained its restless\r\nwing; but, free as the summer cloud, would it come each day, and gladly\r\nwould my delighted soul drink in the silvery notes of its gladdening\r\nmelody.\r\n\r\n6. And it is not _birds_ and _flowers_ alone, that, treated with kindness\r\nflourish so brightly \'neath its heaven-born rays. Individuals, families,\r\nnations, attest its truth. _Legal suasion_ may frighten to compliance,\r\nbut _moral suasion_ rules the will.\r\n\r\n7. To the erring wanderer, in the by and forbidden paths of sin, with a\r\nheart paled in darkness, and lost to every better feeling of his nature,\r\none little word, one little act of kindness, however slight, will find a\r\nsunny resting-place in that sinful shade, and prove a light to guide the\r\nwayward one to holier and better deeds. The lion licked the hand that\r\ndrew the thorn from his wounded foot; and Powhatan stayed the descending\r\nclub, when the burning lips of the Indian girl pressed the prisoner\'s\r\n[Footnote: Captain Smith] pallid brow.\r\n\r\n8. And it is _ever_ thus. There beats not a heart, however debased by\r\nsin, or darkened by sorrow, that has not its noblest impulses aroused,\r\nin view of a _generous and kindly action_. The Holy Father implanted His\r\nown pure principles in the breast of _every one_, and widely do we\r\ndeviate from their just dictates, when an unkind word, or an unkind act,\r\nwounds a broken heart, or crushes a loving, gentle nature.\r\n\r\n9. "_Speak not harshly_,--much of care\r\n    Every human heart must bear;\r\n    Enough of shadows rudely play\r\n    Around the very sunniest way;\r\n    Enough of sorrows darkly lie\r\n    Vailed within the merriest eye.\r\n    By thy childhood\'s gushing tears,\r\n    By thy grief in after years,\r\n    By the anguish thou dost know,\r\n    _Add not to another\'s woe._\r\n\r\n10. "_Speak not harshly_,--much of sin\r\n     Dwelleth every heart within;\r\n     In its closely caverned cells,\r\n     Many a wayward passion dwells.\r\n     By the many hours misspent,\r\n     By the gifts to error lent,\r\n     By the wrongs thou didst not shun,\r\n     By the good thou hast not done,\r\n     With a lenient spirit scan\r\n     The weakness of thy brother man."\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

Ebenezer Webster, the father of Daniel, was a farmer. The vegetables\r\nin his garden had suffered considerably from the depredations of a\r\nwoodchuck, which had his hole or habitation near the premises. Daniel,\r\nsome ten or twelve years old, and his older brother Ezekiel, had set a\r\ntrap, and finally succeeded in capturing the trespasser.\r\n\r\n2. Ezekiel proposed to kill the animal, and end, at once, all further\r\ntrouble from him; but Daniel looked with compassion upon his meek, dumb\r\ncaptive, and offered to let him again go free. The boys could not agree,\r\nand they appealed to their father to decide the case.\r\n\r\n3. "Well, my boys," said the old gentleman, "_I_ will be the _judge_.\r\nThere is the _prisoner_, (pointing to the wood-chuck,) and _you_ shall\r\nbe the _counsel_, and plead the case _for_ and _against_ his life and\r\nliberty."\r\n\r\n4. Ezekiel opened the case with a strong argument, urging the\r\nmischievous nature of the criminal, the great harm he had already done;\r\nsaid that much time and labor had been spent in his capture, and now, if\r\nhe were suffered to live and go again at large, he would renew his\r\ndepredations, and be cunning enough not to suffer himself to be caught\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n5. He urged, further, that his skin was of some value, and that, to make\r\nthe most of him they could, it would not repay half the damage he had\r\nalready done. His argument was ready, practical, to the point, and of\r\nmuch greater length than our limits will allow us to occupy in relating\r\nthe story.\r\n\r\n6. The father looked with pride upon his son, who became a distinguished\r\njurist in his manhood. "Now, Daniel, it is _your_ turn: I\'ll hear what\r\n_you_ have to say."\r\n\r\n7. It was his first case. Daniel saw that the plea of his brother had\r\nsensibly affected his father, the judge; and as his large, brilliant,\r\nblack eyes looked upon the soft, timid, expression of the animal, and he\r\nsaw it tremble with fear in its narrow prison-house, his heart swelled\r\nwith pity, and he urged, with eloquent words, that the captive might\r\nagain go free.\r\n\r\n8. "God," he said, "had made the woodchuck; he made him to live, to\r\nenjoy the bright sunlight, the pure air, the free fields and woods. God\r\nhad not made him, or _any_ thing, in vain; the woodchuck had as much\r\nright to life as any _other_ living thing."\r\n\r\n9. "He was not a destructive animal, as the wolf and the fox were; he\r\nsimply ate a few common vegetables, of which they had plenty, and could\r\nwell spare a part; he destroyed nothing except the little food he needed\r\nto sustain his humble life; and that little food was as sweet to him,\r\nand as necessary to his existence, as was to them the food upon their\r\nmother\'s table."\r\n\r\n10. "God furnished to them food; he gave them all they possessed; and\r\nwould they not spare a little for the dumb creature, that really had as\r\nmuch right to his small share of God\'s bounty, as they themselves had to\r\ntheir portion?"\r\n\r\n11. "Yea, more, the animal had never violated the laws of his nature or\r\nthe laws of God, as man often did; but strictly followed the simple,\r\nharmless instincts he had received from the hand of the Creator of all\r\nthings. Created by God\'s hand, he had a right--a right from God--to\r\nlife, to food, to liberty; and they had no right to deprive him of\r\neither."\r\n\r\n12. He alluded to the mute, but earnest pleadings of the animal for that\r\nlife, as sweet, as dear to him, as their own was to them, and the just\r\njudgment they might expect, if, in selfish cruelty and cold\r\nheartlessness, they took the life they could not restore--the life that\r\nGod alone had given.\r\n\r\n13. During this appeal, the tears had started to the old man\'s eyes, and\r\nwere fast running down his sun-burnt cheeks; every feeling of a father\'s\r\nheart was stirred within him; he saw the future greatness of his son\r\nbefore his eyes, he felt that God had blessed him in his children,\r\nbeyond the lot of most men.\r\n\r\n14. His pity and sympathy were awakened by the eloquent words of\r\ncompassion, and the strong appeal for mercy; and, forgetting the judge\r\nin the man and father, he sprang from his chair, (while Daniel was in\r\nthe midst of his argument, without thinking he had already won his\r\ncase,) and, turning to his older son, dashing the tears from his eyes,\r\nexclaimed, "_Ezekiel, Ezekiel, you let that woodchuck go!_"\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. What did Ezekiel propose to do with the woodchuck after\r\nhe was caught? 2. What argument did he offer for so doing? 3. What did\r\nDaniel wish to do with him? 4. What argument did he offer? 4.

Do not ask the teacher or some classmate to solve that hard problem.\r\nDO IT YOURSELF. You might as well let him eat your dinner as "do your\r\nsums" for you. It is in studying as in eating; _he who does it_, gets\r\nthe benefit, and not _he who sees it done_. In almost any school, the\r\nteacher learns more than the best scholars, simply because he is\r\ncompelled to solve all the difficult problems, and answer all the\r\nquestions of the indolent pupils.\r\n\r\n2. Do not ask your teacher to parse that difficult word, or assist you\r\nin the performance of any of your studies. DO IT YOURSELF. Never mind,\r\nthough they _do_ look dark. Do not ask even a hint from any one. TRY\r\nAGAIN. Every trial increases your ability, and you will finally succeed\r\nby dint of the very wisdom and strength gained in the effort, even\r\nthough, at first, the problem was beyond your skill. It is the _study_,\r\nand not the _answer_, that really rewards your labor.\r\n\r\n3. Look at that boy, who has just succeeded after six hours of hard\r\nstudy. How his large eye is lit up with a proud joy, as he marches to\r\nhis class! He treads like a conqueror! And well he may. Last night his\r\nlamp burned, and this morning he waked at dawn. Once or twice he nearly\r\ngave it up. He had tried his last thought; but a new thought strikes\r\nhim, and he ponders the last process. He tries once more, and succeeds;\r\nand now mark the air of conscious strength with which he pronounces his\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\n4. His poor, weak schoolmate, who gave up that same problem, after his\r\nfirst trial, now looks up to him with something of a wonder, as a\r\nsuperior being. And he _is_ his superior. That problem lies there, a\r\ngreat gulf between those boys who stood side by side yesterday.\r\n\r\n5. The boy who _did it for himself_, has taken a stride upward, and what\r\nis better still, _has gained strength_ to take other and better ones.\r\nThe boy who waited to see _others do it_, has lost both strength and\r\ncourage, and is already looking for some good excuse to give up school\r\nand study forever.\r\n\r\n6. DO IT YOURSELF. Remember the counsel given to the artist, who lay\r\nreclining upon his couch, and wondering what the fates would work out\r\nfor him. Directing his attention to a block of unhewn marble, with a\r\nchisel lying by its side, the sculptor in the vision is represented as\r\nthus addressing him: "Sir,\r\n\r\n  "There\'s the marble, there\'s the chisel,\r\n    Take it, work it to thy will;\r\n  _Thou alone_ must shape thy future,\r\n    Heaven send thee strength and skill!"\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

JOHN TODD.\r\n\r\n1. In a remote field stood a large tulip tree, apparently of a century\'s\r\ngrowth, and one of the most gigantic of that splendid species. It looked\r\nlike the father of the surrounding forest. A single tree, of huge\r\ndimensions, standing all alone, is a sublime object.\r\n\r\n2. On the top of this tree, an old eagle, commonly called the "Fishing\r\nEagle," had built her nest every year, for many years, and, unmolested,\r\nraised her young. What is remarkable, as she procured her food from the\r\nocean, this tree stood full ten miles from the sea-shore. It had long\r\nbeen known as the "Old Eagle tree."\r\n\r\n3. On a warm, sunny day, the workmen were hoeing corn in an adjoining\r\nfield. At a certain hour of the day, the old eagle was known to set off\r\nfor the sea-side, to gather food for her young. As she this day returned\r\nwith a large fish in her claws, the workmen surrounded the tree, and, by\r\nyelling, and hooting, and throwing stones, so scared the poor bird that\r\nshe dropped her fish, and they carried it off in triumph.\r\n\r\n4. The men soon dispersed; but Joseph sat down under a bush near by, to\r\nwatch, and to bestow unavailing pity. The bird soon returned to her nest\r\nwithout food. The eaglets at once set up a cry for food, so shrill, so\r\nclear, and so clamorous, that the boy was greatly moved.\r\n\r\n5. The parent bird seemed to try to soothe them; but their appetites\r\nwere too keen, and it was all in vain. She then perched herself on a\r\nlimb near them, and looked down into the nest with a look that seemed to\r\nsay, "I know not what to do next."\r\n\r\n6. Her indecision was but momentary; again she poised herself, uttered\r\none or two sharp notes, as if telling them to "lie still," balanced her\r\nbody, spread her wings, and was away again for the sea!\r\n\r\n7. Joseph was determined to see the result. His eyes followed her till\r\nshe grew small, smaller,--a mere speck in the sky,--and then\r\ndisappeared. What boy has not often watched the flight of the bird of\r\nhis country in this way?\r\n\r\n8. She was gone nearly two hours, about double her usual time for a\r\nvoyage, when she again returned, on a slow, weary wing, flying\r\nuncommonly low, in order to have a heavier atmosphere to sustain her,\r\nwith another fish in her talons.\r\n\r\n9. On nearing the field, she made a circuit around it, to see if her\r\nenemies were again there. Finding the coast clear, she once more reached\r\nher tree, drooping, faint, and weary, and evidently nearly exhausted.\r\nAgain the eaglets set up their cry, which was soon hushed by the\r\ndistribution of a dinner, such as--save the cooking--a king might\r\nadmire.\r\n\r\n10. "GLORIOUS BIRD!" cried the boy in ecstacy, and aloud; "what a\r\nspirit! Other birds can fly swifter, others can sing more sweetly,\r\nothers can scream more loudly; but what _other bird_, when persecuted\r\nand robbed--when weary--when discouraged--when so far from sea,--would\r\nhave done this!\r\n\r\n11. "GLORIOUS BIRD! I will learn a lesson from thee to-day. I will never\r\nforget hereafter, that when the spirit is determined, it can do almost\r\nanything. Others would have drooped and hung the head, and mourned over\r\nthe cruelty of man, and sighed over the wants of the nestlings; but\r\n_thou,_ by at once recovering the loss, hast forgotten all.\r\n\r\n12. "I will learn of thee, _noble bird!_ I will remember this. I will\r\nset my mark high. I will try to do something, and to be something in the\r\nworld; _I will never yield to discouragements."_\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. How far was this Old Eagle tree from the seashore? 2. In\r\nwhat way did the workmen obtain the fish she brought for her young? 3.\r\nWhat is said of the eaglets and the parent bird, when she returned to\r\nthe nest? 4. What did she then do? 5.

Knowledge can not be stolen from you. It can not be bought or sold.\r\nYou may be _poor_, and the sheriff come into your house, and sell your\r\nfurniture at auction, or drive away your cow, or take your lamb, and\r\nleave you homeless and penniless; but he can not lay the law\'s hand upon\r\nthe _jewelry of your mind_. This can not be taken for debt; neither can\r\nyou _give it away_, though you give enough of it to fill a million\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n2. I will tell you what such giving is like. Suppose, now, that there\r\nwere no sun nor stars in the heavens, nor any thing that shone in the\r\nblack brow of night; and suppose that a lighted lamp were put into your\r\nhand, which should burn wasteless and clear amid all the tempests that\r\nshould brood upon this lower world.\r\n\r\n3. Suppose next, that there were a thousand millions of human beings on\r\nthe earth with you, each holding in his hand an unlighted lamp, filled\r\nwith the same oil as yours, and capable of giving as much light. Suppose\r\nthese millions should come, one by one, to you, and light each his lamp\r\nby yours, would they rob you of any light? Would less of it shine on\r\nyour own path? Would your lamp burn more dimly for lighting a thousand\r\nmillions?\r\n\r\n4. Thus it is, young friends. In getting rich in the things which perish\r\nwith the using, men have often obeyed to the letter that first\r\ncommandment of selfishness: _"Keep what you can get, and get what you\r\ncan."_ In filling your minds with the wealth of knowledge, you must\r\nreverse this rule, and obey this law: _"Keep what you give, and give\r\nwhat you can."_\r\n\r\n5. The fountain of knowledge is filled by its _outlets,_ not by its\r\ninlets. You can _learn_ nothing which you do not _teach;_ you can\r\nacquire nothing of intellectual wealth, except by _giving._ In the\r\nillustration of the lamps, which I have given you, was not the light of\r\nthe thousands of millions which were lighted at yours, as much your\r\nlight, as if it all came from your solitary lamp? Did you not dispel\r\ndarkness by giving away light?\r\n\r\n6. Remember this parable, and, whenever you fall in with an unlighted\r\nmind in your walk of life, drop a kind and glowing thought upon it from\r\nyours, and set it a-burning in the world with a light that shall shine\r\nin some dark place to beam on the benighted.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. What is said of knowledge? 2. What is the giving of\r\nknowledge like? 3. In getting rich, what precept have men obeyed? 4.\r\nWhat precept must be obeyed in getting knowledge? 5. How is knowledge\r\nbest acquired? 6. What is meant by the _jewelry of the mind,_ first\r\nparagraph? 7.

SIGOURNEY.\r\n\r\n1. The lessons of our school are over. The lights in the distant windows\r\nare extinguished, one after the other. The village will soon be lost in\r\nslumber. When all the men and the women are asleep, must we keep awake\r\nto learn lessons?\r\n\r\n2. In large cities, there may be heard, now and then, the rushing wheel\r\nof the traveler. The watchmen pace their round, and cry, _"All is\r\nwell."_ In the long, cold nights of Norway, the watchmen who guard the\r\ncapitol, pronounce, in a solemn tone, "God bless our good city of\r\nBergen!"\r\n\r\n3. In the garrison, or the endangered fortress, the armed sentinel keeps\r\nwatch, lest they should be surprised by the foe. But in this peaceful\r\nvillage there is no need of either sentinel or watchman. Why may we not\r\ngo to sleep, instead of learning Night\'s lessons?\r\n\r\n4. My son, one of these you may learn in a moment. Did you say that all\r\nwill soon be sleeping? No! there is one Eye that never slumbers. He who\r\nmade all the people, keepeth watch above the everlasting hills. Commit\r\nyourself to His care.\r\n\r\n5. Now, will you learn with me the second lesson of the night? Lift your\r\neyes to yon glorious canopy. Seest thou not there a sentinel, set by the\r\nEternal, at the northern gate of heaven,--the pole-star?\r\n\r\n6. The pole-star! Blessings are breathed upon it, by the weary caravan,\r\nfearing the poisonous wind of the desert,--by the red forest-children,\r\nseeking their home beyond the far Western prairies,--and by the lonely\r\nmariner, upon the pathless ocean.\r\n\r\n7. The stars! See them! The oil in their lamps never burns out. These\r\nglorious constellations wheel their mighty course unchanged, while "man\r\ndieth and wasteth away, yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?"\r\n[Footnote: Job, 14th chap., 10th verse.]\r\n\r\n8. Yon brilliant orbs maintain their places, while countless generations\r\npass away, and nations disappear and are forgotten. Let us bow in\r\nhumility before "Him who bringeth out their host by number, who calleth\r\nthem all by names, by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong\r\nin power; not one faileth." [Footnote: Isaiah. 40th chap., 26th verse.]\r\n\r\n9. Thirteen times in the year, Night, the teacher, gives extra lessons.\r\nWill you be there to learn them? First, she hangs up a pale crescent in\r\nthe west. The ancient Jews hailed its infant beam, and answering fires\r\nof joy were kindled on the hills of Palestine.[Headnote 1]\r\n\r\n10. Next, she summons forth a rounded orb, clad in full effulgence, and\r\ncommits to it the regency when the sun retires. Lastly, a slender,\r\nwaning crescent appears nightly, like an aged man, ready to descend into\r\nthe night of the tomb.\r\n\r\n11.\r\n   "Soon as the evening shades prevail,\r\n   The moon takes up the wondrous tale,\r\n   And nightly to the listening earth,\r\n   Repeats the story of her birth;\r\n   While all the stars that round her burn,\r\n   And all the planets in their turn,\r\n   Confirm the tidings as they roll,\r\n   And spread the truth from pole to pole."\r\n\r\n12. These are some of Night\'s lessons. Are you tired of them? Or, will\r\nyou learn one more? Lift up your heart to Him who has given you the past\r\nday, with thanks for its blessings,--with penitence for its\r\nfaults,--with supplication for strength and wisdom for the time that is\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n13. "Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth\r\nknowledge" [Footnote: Psalm 19th, 2nd verse.] of God. Thus, meekly and\r\nfaithfully studying Night\'s lessons, may we find\r\n\r\n  "Even sorrow, touched by Heaven, grows bright\r\n    With more than rapture\'s ray,\r\n  As darkness shows us worlds of light,\r\n    We never saw by day."\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. Who watches over us when asleep? 2. In what way is the\r\npole-star useful to man? 3. What is said of the stars? 4. What extra\r\nlessons is it that night gives thirteen times a year? 5.

They are sowing their seed of pleasant thought,\r\n   In the spring\'s green light they have blithely wrought;\r\n   They have brought their fancies from wood and dell,\r\n   Where the mosses creep, and the flower-buds swell;\r\n      _Rare_ shall the harvest be!\r\n\r\n3. They are sowing the seeds of word and deed,\r\n   Which the cold know not, nor the careless heed,--\r\n   Of the gentle word and the kindest deed,\r\n   That have blessed the heart in its sorest need;\r\n      _Sweet_ shall the harvest be!\r\n\r\n4. And some are sowing the seeds of pain,\r\n   Of late remorse, and in maddened brain;\r\n   And the stars shall fall, and the sun shall wane,\r\n   Ere they root the weeds from the soil again;\r\n      _Dark_ will the harvest be!\r\n\r\n5.

Our noble ship lay at anchor in the Bay of Tangier, a fortified town\r\nin the extreme northwest of Africa. The day had been extremely mild,\r\nwith a gentle breeze sweeping to the northward and westward; but, toward\r\nthe close of the afternoon, the sea-breeze died away, and one of those\r\nsultry, oven-like breathings came from the great, sun-burnt Sahara\r\n[Headnote 1].\r\n\r\n2. Half an hour before sundown, the captain gave the cheering order for\r\nthe boatswain to call the hands to "go in swimming;" and, in less than\r\nfive minutes, the forms of our tars were seen leaping from the arms of\r\nthe lower yards, into the water. One of the studding sails, with its\r\ncorners suspended from the main yard-arm and the swinging boom, had been\r\nlowered into the water, and into this most of the swimmers made their\r\nway.\r\n\r\n3. Among those who seemed to be enjoying the sport most heartily, were\r\ntwo of the boys, Timothy Wallace and Frederic Fairbanks, the latter of\r\nwhom was the son of our old gunner; and, in a laughing mood, they\r\nstarted out from the studding sail on a race. There was a loud ringing\r\nshout of joy on their lips as they put off, and they darted through the\r\nwater like fishes. The surface of the sea was smooth as glass, though\r\nits bosom rose in long, heavy swells that set in from the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n4. The vessel was moored with a long sweep from both cables, and one of\r\nthe buoys of the anchor was far away on the starboard quarter, where it\r\nrose and fell with the lazy swells of the waves. Toward this buoy the\r\ntwo lads made their way, young Fairbanks taking the lead; but, when they\r\nwere within about twenty or thirty fathoms of the buoy, Wallace shot\r\nahead and promised to win the race.\r\n\r\n5. The old gunner had watched the progress of his little son with a\r\ngreat degree of pride; and when he saw him drop behind, he leaped upon\r\nthe quarter-deck, and was just upon the point of urging him on by a\r\nshout, when a cry was heard that struck him with instant horror.\r\n\r\n6. "_A shark! a shark!_" was sounded from the captain of the forecastle;\r\nand, at the sound of these terrible words, the men who were in the\r\nwater, leaped and plunged toward the ship. Right abeam, at the distance\r\nof three or four cables\' lengths, was seen the wake of a shark in the\r\nwater, where the back of the monster was visible. His course was for the\r\nboys.\r\n\r\n7. For a moment, the gunner stood like one bereft of reason; but, on the\r\nnext, he shouted at the top of his voice, for the boys to turn; but they\r\nheard him not. Stoutly the two swimmers strove for the goal, all\r\nunconscious of their imminent danger. Their merry laugh still rang over\r\nthe waters, and, at length, they both touched the buoy together.\r\n\r\n8. Oh, what agony filled the heart of the gunner! A boat had put off,\r\nbut he knew that it could not reach the boys in season, and every moment\r\nhe expected to see the monster sink from sight,--_then_ he knew that all\r\nhope would be gone. At this moment, a cry reached the ship, that pierced\r\nevery heart,--the boys had discovered their enemy.\r\n\r\n9. The cry started the old gunner to his senses, and quicker than\r\nthought, he sprang from the quarter-deck. The guns were all loaded and\r\nshotted, fore and aft, and none knew their temper better than he. With\r\nsteady hand, made strong by sudden hope, the old gunner seized a\r\npriming-wire and picked the cartridge of one of the quarter guns; then\r\nhe took from his pocket a percussion cap, fixed it in its place, and set\r\nback the hammer of the patent lock.\r\n\r\n10. With a giant strength the old man swayed the breech of the heavy gun\r\nto its bearing, and then seizing the string of the lock, he stood back\r\nand watched for the next swell that would bring the shark in range. He\r\nhad aimed the piece some distance ahead of his mark; but yet a little\r\nmoment would settle his hopes and fears.\r\n\r\n11. Every breath was hushed, and every heart in that old ship beat\r\npainfully. The boat was yet some distance from the boys, while the\r\nhorrid sea-monster was fearfully near. Suddenly the air was rent by the\r\nroar of the heavy gun; and, as the old man knew his shot was gone, he\r\nsank back upon the hatch, and covered his face with his hands, as if\r\nafraid to see the result of his own efforts; for, if he had failed, he\r\nknew that his boy was lost.\r\n\r\n12. For a moment after the report of the gun had died away upon the air,\r\nthere was an unbroken silence; but, as the dense smoke arose from the\r\nsurface of the water, there was, at first, a low murmur breaking from\r\nthe lips of the men,--that murmur grew louder and stronger, till it\r\nswelled to a joyous, deafening shout. The old gunner sprang to his feet,\r\nand gazed off on the water, and the first thing that met his view, was\r\nthe huge carcass of the shark, floating on his back--a mangled, lifeless\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n13. In a few moments, the boats reached the daring swimmers, and,\r\ngreatly frightened, they were brought on board. The old man clasped his\r\nboy in his arms, and then, overcome by the powerful excitement, he\r\nleaned upon a gun for support. I have seen men in all the phases of\r\nexcitement and suspense, but never have I seen three human beings more\r\novercome by thrilling emotions, than on that startling moment when they\r\nfirst knew the effect of our gunner\'s shot.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

A certain Persian king, while traveling in disguise, with but few\r\nattendants, was waylaid by robbers, who threatened to take not only his\r\ngoods, but his life.\r\n\r\n2. Feeling himself beyond the reach of human aid, he inwardly made a\r\nvow, that if God would incline the hearts of these ruffians to mercy,\r\nand restore him in safety to his family and people, he would distribute\r\nall the money then in his treasury, in alms to the needy of his realm.\r\n\r\n3. The robbers, from some unknown cause, liberated him, and he soon\r\nreached home in safety, having sustained no injury, save the loss of the\r\nsmall purse of gold that he had carried in his girdle.\r\n\r\n4. Desirous of keeping the vow he had made, he summoned his officers,\r\nand commanded them to make immediate distribution to the poor, of all\r\nthat the treasury contained, at the time of his return.\r\n\r\n5. But his officers, more miserly than himself, and, fearful that they\r\nmight fall short in their salaries and pensions, began to urge upon the\r\nmonarch the folly of keeping this rash vow, and the danger of thus\r\ninvolving himself and his kingdom in difficulties.\r\n\r\n6. Finding he still remained firm, they took other grounds, and\r\nplausibly argued that the troops and other officials needed aid as well\r\nas the poor; and, as by the _words_ of his vow, he had bound himself to\r\ndistribute the contents of the treasury to those who had claim to\r\nrelief, the public servants certainly came within the required limits.\r\n\r\n7. Bewildered by their false logic, and sincerely desirous of doing\r\nright, he appealed to a certain sage who dwelt near the royal palace,\r\nand determined to abide by his decision.\r\n\r\n8. The sage, after hearing the case, only asked the following simple\r\nquestion: "Of whom were you thinking when you made the vow,--the poor,\r\nor the public servants?" The monarch replied, "Of the poor." "Then,"\r\nanswered the sage, "it is to the _poor_ you are bound to distribute\r\nthese funds; for you are not _really_ fulfilling your vow, unless you do\r\nthat which you intended to do when it was made." The king was satisfied\r\nthat this was the right decision, and did as the sage advised.\r\n\r\n9. Let the young bear in mind that God is a being of truth, requiring\r\ntruth in the inward heart; and, if they would have His approval, and\r\nthat of their own consciences, they must avoid not only the _outward_\r\nappearance of falsehood, but the slightest evasion or deceit; and when\r\npromises have been made, fulfill not only the _letter_, but the _spirit_\r\nof that which they agreed to perform.\r\n\r\n10. Beware of the first and slightest departure from truth, of the least\r\nendeavor to deceive, and even of the desire to have others believe what\r\nis not so. Let your motto be, _"The truth, the whole truth, and nothing\r\nbut the truth."_\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. What happened to a certain Persian king? 2. What vow did\r\nhe then make? 3.

Whang, the miller, was naturally avaricious; nobody loved money\r\nbetter than he, or more respected those that had it. When people would\r\ntalk of a rich man in company, Whang would say, "_I_ know him very well,\r\n_he_ and _I_ have been very long acquainted; _he_ and _I_ are intimate."\r\n\r\n2. But, if a poor man was mentioned, he had not the least knowledge of\r\nthe man; he might be very well, for aught _he_ knew; but he was not fond\r\nof making many acquaintances, and loved to choose his company.\r\n\r\n3. Whang, however, with all his eagerness for riches, was poor. He had\r\nnothing but the profits of his mill to support him; but, though these\r\nwere small, they were certain: while it stood and went, he was sure of\r\neating; and his frugality was such, that he, every day, laid some money\r\nby; which he would, at intervals, count and contemplate with much\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n4. Yet still his acquisitions were not equal to his desires; he only\r\nfound himself above want; whereas he desired to be possessed of\r\naffluence. One day, as he was indulging these wishes, he was informed\r\nthat a neighbor of his had found a pan of money under ground, having\r\ndreamed of it three nights in succession.\r\n\r\n5. These tidings were daggers to the heart of poor Whang. "Here am I,"\r\nsaid he, "toiling and moiling from morning till night for a few paltry\r\nfarthings, while neighbor Thanks only goes quietly to bed, and dreams\r\nhimself into thousands before morning. Oh, that I could dream like him!\r\nWith what pleasure would I dig round the pan! How slyly would I carry it\r\nhome! Not even my wife should see me! And then, oh the pleasure of\r\nthrusting one\'s hands into a heap of gold up to the elbows!"\r\n\r\n6. Such reflections only served to make the miller unhappy. He\r\ndiscontinued his former assiduity; he was quite disgusted with small\r\ngains; and his customers began to forsake him. Every day he repeated the\r\nwish, and every night laid himself down in order to dream. Fortune, that\r\nwas for a long time unkind, at last, however, seemed to smile upon his\r\ndistress, and indulged him with the wished-for vision.\r\n\r\n7. He dreamed that under a certain part of the foundation of his mill,\r\nthere was concealed a monstrous pan of gold and diamonds, buried deep in\r\nthe ground, and covered with a large flat stone. He concealed his good\r\nluck from every person, as is usual in money-dreams, in order to have\r\nthe vision repeated the two succeeding nights, by which he should be\r\ncertain of its truth. His wishes in this, also, were answered; he still\r\ndreamed of the same pan of money, in the very same place.\r\n\r\n8. Now, therefore, it was past a doubt; so, getting up early the third\r\nmorning, he repaired, alone, with a mattock in his hand, to the mill,\r\nand began to undermine that part of the wall to which the vision\r\ndirected. The first omen of success that he met with, was a broken ring;\r\ndigging still deeper, he turned up a house-tile, quite new and entire.\r\n\r\n9. At last, after much digging, he came to a broad flat stone; but then\r\nit was so large, that it was beyond his strength to remove it.\r\n"_There_," cried he in raptures to himself, "_there it is!_ under this\r\nstone, there is room for a very large pan of diamonds indeed. I must\r\ne\'en go home to my wife, and tell her the whole affair, and get her to\r\nassist me in turning it up."

But these\r\ntransports, however, did not allay their eagerness to know the exact\r\nsum; returning, together, to the place where Whang had been digging,\r\nthere they found--not, indeed, the expected treasure--but the mill,\r\ntheir only support, undermined and fallen!\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

Every one knows, who lives in the country, what a chimney-swallow is.\r\nThey are among the birds that seem to love the neighborhood of man. Many\r\nbirds there are, that nestle confidingly in the protection of their\r\nsuperiors, and are seldom found nesting or breeding far from human\r\nhabitations.\r\n\r\n2. The wren builds close to your door. Sparrows and robins, if well\r\ntreated, will make their nests right under your window, in some favorite\r\ntree, and will teach you, if you choose to go into the business, how to\r\nbuild birds\' nests.\r\n\r\n3. A great deal of politeness and fidelity may be learned. The female\r\nbird is waited upon, fed, cheered with singing, during her incubation,\r\nin a manner that might give lessons to the household. Nay, when she\r\nneeds exercise and recreation, her husband very demurely takes her\r\nplace, and keeps the eggs warm in the most gentlemanly way.\r\n\r\n4. Barn-swallows have a very sensible appreciation of the pleasures of\r\nan ample barn. A barn might not be found quite the thing to live in,\r\n(although we have seen many a place where we would take the barn sooner\r\nthan the house,) but it is one of the most charming places in a\r\nsummer-day to lounge, read, or nap in.\r\n\r\n5. And, as you lie on your back upon the sweet-scented hay-mow, or upon\r\nclean straw thrown down on the great floor, reading books of natural\r\nhistory, it is very pleasant to see the flitting swallows glance in and\r\nout, or course about under the roof, with motion so lithe and rapid as\r\nto seem more like the glancing of shadows than the winging of birds.\r\nTheir mud-nests are clean, if they _are_ made of dirt; and you would\r\nnever dream, from their feathers, what sort of a house they lived in.\r\n\r\n6. But, it was of _chimney-swallows_ that we began to write; and they\r\nare just now roaring in the little, stubbed chimney behind us, to remind\r\nus of our duty. Every evening we hear them; for a nest of young ones\r\nbrings the parents in with food, early and late, and every entrance or\r\nexit is like a distant roll of thunder, or like those old-fashioned\r\nrumblings of high winds in the chimney, which made us children think\r\nthat all out-of-doors was coming down the chimney in stormy nights.\r\n\r\n7. These little architects build their simple nests upon the sides of\r\nthe chimney with sticks, which they are said to break off from dead\r\nbranches of trees, though they might more easily pick them up already\r\nprepared. But they, doubtless, have their own reasons for cutting their\r\nown timber. Then these are glued to the wall by a saliva which they\r\nsecrete, so that they carry their mortar in their mouths, and use their\r\nbills for trowels.\r\n\r\n8. When the young are ready to leave, they climb up the chimney to the\r\ntop, by means of their sharp claws, aided by their tail-feathers, which\r\nare short, stiff, and at the end armed with sharp spines. Two broods are\r\nreared in a season. From the few which congregate in any one\r\nneighborhood, one would not suspect the great numbers which assemble at\r\nthe end of the season. Audubon estimated that _nine thousand_ entered a\r\nlarge sycamore-tree, every night, to roost, near Louisville, Kentucky.\r\n\r\n9. Sometimes the little nest has been slighted in building, or the\r\nweight proves too great, and down it comes into the fire-place, to the\r\ngreat amusement of the children, who are all a-fever to hold in their\r\nhands these clean, bright-eyed little fellows. Who would suspect that\r\nthey had ever been bred in such a flue?\r\n\r\n10. And it was just this thought that set us to writing. Because a bird\r\nlives in a chimney, he need not be _smutty_. There is many a fine\r\nfeather that lives in a chimney-corner. Nor are birds the _only_\r\ninstances. Many men are born in a garret, or in a cellar, who fly out of\r\nit, as soon as fledged, as fine as any body. A lowly home has reared\r\nmany high natures.\r\n\r\n11. On these bare sticks, right against the bricks, in this smoky flue,\r\nthe eggs are laid, the brooding goes on, the young are hatched, fed,\r\ngrown. But then comes the day when they spread the wing, and the whole\r\nheaven is theirs! From morning to night, they can not touch the bounds\r\nof their liberty!\r\n\r\n12. And, in like manner, it is with the human soul that has learned to\r\nknow its liberty. Born in a body, pent up, and cramped, it seems\r\nimprisoned in a mere smoky flue for passions. But, when once faith has\r\ntaught the soul that it has wings, then it begins to fly; and flying,\r\nfinds that all God\'s domain is its liberty.\r\n\r\n13. And, as the swallow that comes back to roost in its hard hole at\r\nnight, is quite content, so that the morning gives it again all the\r\nbright heavens for its soaring-ground, so may men, close quartered and\r\ncramped in bodily accommodations, be quite patient of their narrow\r\nbounds, for their thoughts may fly out every day gloriously.\r\n\r\n14. And as, in autumn, these children of the chimney gather in flocks,\r\nand fly away to heavens without a winter, so men shall find a day when\r\nthey, too, shall migrate; and, rising into a higher sphere, without\r\nstorm or winter, shall remember the troubles of this mortal life, as\r\nbirds in Florida may be supposed to remember the northern chills, which\r\ndrove them forth to a fairer clime.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

On a bright moonlight night, in the month of February, 1831, when it\r\nwas intensely cold, the little brig which I commanded, lay quietly at\r\nher anchors, inside of Sandy Hook. We had had a hard time, beating about\r\nfor eleven days off this coast, with cutting north-easters blowing, and\r\nsnow and sleet falling for the most part of that time.\r\n\r\n2. Forward, the vessel was thickly coated with ice, and it was hard work\r\nto handle her; as the rigging and sails were stiff, and yielded only\r\nwhen the strength of the men was exerted to the utmost. When we, at\r\nlength, made the port, all hands were worn down and exhausted.\r\n\r\n3. "A bitter cold night, Mr. Larkin," I said to my mate, as I tarried\r\nfor a short time upon deck. The worthy down-easter buttoned his coat\r\nmore tightly around him, and, looking up to the moon, replied, "It\'s a\r\nwhistler, captain; and nothing can live comfortably out of blankets\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n4. "The tide is running out swift and strong, and it will be well to\r\nkeep a sharp look-out for this floating ice, Mr. Larkin," said I, as I\r\nturned to go below. "Ay, ay, sir," responded the faithful mate.\r\n\r\n5. About two hours afterward, I was aroused from a sound sleep by the\r\nvigilant officer. "Excuse me for disturbing you, captain," said he, as\r\nhe detected an expression of vexation in my face, "but I wish you would\r\nturn out, and come on deck as soon as possible."\r\n\r\n6. "What\'s the matter, Mr. Larkin," said I. "Why, sir, I have been\r\nwatching a large cake of ice, which swept by at a distance, a moment\r\nago; and I saw something black upon it, something that I thought moved.\r\nThe moon is under a cloud, and I could not see distinctly; but I believe\r\nthere is a child floating out to the sea, this freezing night, on that\r\ncake of ice."\r\n\r\n7. We were on deck before either spoke another word. The mate pointed\r\nout, with no little difficulty, the cake of ice floating off to the\r\nleeward, with its white, glittering surface broken by a black spot. "Get\r\nthe glass, Mr. Larkin," said I; "the moon will be out of that cloud in a\r\nmoment, and then we can see distinctly."\r\n\r\n8. I kept my eye upon the receding mass of ice, while the moon was\r\nslowly working her way through a heavy bank of clouds. The mate stood by\r\nme with the glass; and when the full light fell upon the water with a\r\nbrilliancy only known in our northern latitudes, I put the glass to my\r\neye. One glance was enough.\r\n\r\n9. (_\'\'_)"_Forward, there!_" I hailed at the top of my voice; and, with\r\none bound, I reached the main hatch, and began to clear away the little\r\ncutter, which was stowed in the ship\'s yawl. Mr. Larkin had taken the\r\nglass to look for himself, "_There are two children on that cake of\r\nice!_" he exclaimed, as he hastened to assist me in getting out the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\n10. The men answered my hail, and walked quickly aft. In a short space\r\nof time, we launched the cutter, into which Mr. Larkin and myself\r\njumped, followed by the two men, who took the oars. I rigged the tiller,\r\nand the mate sat beside me in the stern sheets.\r\n\r\n11. "Do you see that cake of ice with something black upon it, my lads?\r\nPut me alongside of that, and I\'ll give you a month\'s extra wages when\r\nyou are paid off," said I to the men.\r\n\r\n12. They bent to their oars, but their strokes were uneven and feeble;\r\nfor they were worn out by the hard duty of the preceding fortnight; and,\r\nthough they did their best, the boat made little more headway than the\r\ntide. It was a losing chase, and Mr. Larkin, who was suffering torture\r\nas he saw how little we gained, cried out, "_Pull, lads! I\'ll double the\r\ncaptain\'s prize: two months\' extra pay: pull, lads! pull for life!_"\r\n\r\n13. A convulsive effort at the oars told how willing the men were to\r\nobey; but the strength of the strong man was gone. One of the poor\r\nfellows washed us twice in recovering his oar, and then gave out; and\r\nthe other was nearly as far gone. Mr. Larkin sprang forward and seized\r\nthe deserted oar. "Lie down in the bottom of the boat," said he to the\r\nman; "and, captain, take the other oar; we must row for ourselves."\r\n\r\n14. I took the second man\'s place. Larkin had stripped off his coat,\r\nand, as he pulled the bow, I waited for the signal stroke. It came\r\ngently, but firm; and the next moment we were pulling a long, steady\r\nstroke; gradually increasing in rapidity, until the wood seemed to smoke\r\nin the row-locks. We kept time, each by the long, deep breathing of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n15. Such a pull! We bent forward until our faces almost touched our\r\nknees; and then throwing all our strength into the backward movement,\r\ndrew on the oar until every inch covered by the sweep was gained. Thus\r\nwe worked at the oars for fifteen minutes; and it seemed to me as many\r\nhours. The sweat rolled off in great drops, and I was enveloped in a\r\nsteam generated from my own body.\r\n\r\n16. "Are we almost up to it, Mr. Larkin?" I gasped out. "Almost,\r\ncaptain," said he: "and _don\'t give up!_ for the love of our dear little\r\nones at home: _don\'t give up_, captain!" The oars flashed as their\r\nblades turned up to the moonlight, for the men who plied them were\r\nfathers, and had fathers\' hearts.\r\n\r\n17. Suddenly Mr. Larkin ceased pulling; and my heart, for a moment,\r\nalmost stopped its beating; for the terrible thought that he had given\r\nout, crossed my mind. But I was re-assured by his voice, (_p_) "Gently,\r\ncaptain, gently: a stroke or two more: there, that will do;" and the\r\nnext moment Mr. Larkin sprang upon the ice. I started up, and, calling\r\nto the men to make fast the boat to the ice, followed him.\r\n\r\n18. We ran to the dark spot in the center of the mass, and found two\r\nlittle boys. The head of the smaller was resting in the bosom of the\r\nlarger; and both were fast asleep. The lethargy, which would have been\r\nfatal but for the timely rescue, had overcome them.\r\n\r\n19. Mr. Larkin grasped one of the lads, cut off his shoes, tore off his\r\njacket, and then, loosening his own garments to the skin, placed the\r\ncold child in contact with his own warm body, carefully wrapping his\r\novercoat around him. I did the same with the other child, and we then\r\nreturned to the boat.\r\n\r\n20. The children, as we learned when we had the delight of restoring\r\nthem to their parents, were playing on the cake of ice, which had jammed\r\ninto a bend of the river, about ten miles above New York. A movement of\r\nthe tide set the ice in motion, and the little fellows were borne away,\r\nthat cold night, and would have inevitably perished, but for Mr.\r\nLarkin\'s espying them as they were sweeping out to sea.\r\n\r\n21. "How do you feel, Mr. Larkin?" I said to the mate, the morning after\r\nthis adventure. "A little stiff in the arms, captain," the noble fellow\r\nreplied, while the big tears of grateful happiness gathered in his\r\neyes,--"a little stiff in the arms, captain, but very easy here,"\r\nlaying his hand on the rough chest in which beat a true and manly heart.\r\nMy quaint down-easter, He who lashes the seas into fury, and lets loose\r\nthe tempest, will care for thee!

Many years ago, an old Scotch woman sat alone, spinning by the\r\nkitchen fire, in her little cottage. The room was adorned with the\r\nspoils of the chase, and many implements of war and hunting. There were\r\nspears, bows and arrows, swords, and shields; and, against the side of\r\nthe room, hung a pair of huge antlers, once reared on the lordly brow of\r\na "stag of ten," [Footnote: That is, a stag ten years old. The age of\r\nthe animal is known by the number of prongs or tines, each year one new\r\nprong being added.] on which were suspended skins, plaids, bonnets, and\r\none or two ponderous battle-axes.\r\n\r\n2. The table, in the middle of the floor, was spread for supper, and\r\nsome oatmeal cakes were baking before the fire. But the dame was not\r\nthinking of any of _these things_, nor of her two manly sons, who, in an\r\nadjoining room, were busily preparing for the next day\'s sport.\r\n\r\n3. She was thinking of the distracted state of her native land, and of\r\nthe good king, Robert Bruce, a fugitive in his own kingdom, beset, on\r\nevery hand, by open enemies and secret traitors. "Alas!" thought she,\r\n"to-night I dwell here in peace, while to-morrow may see me driven out\r\ninto the heath; and even now our king is a wanderer, with no shelter for\r\nhis weary limbs."\r\n\r\n4. A loud knock at the door broke in upon her musings. She rose,\r\ntrembling with fear, to unbar the entrance, and beheld a man closely\r\nmuffled in a cloak. "My good woman," said he, "will you grant a poor\r\ntraveler the shelter of your roof to-night\'?"\r\n\r\n5. "Right willingly will I," said she; "for the love of _one_, for whose\r\nsake all travelers are welcome here." 6. "For whose sake is it that you\r\nmake all wanderers welcome?" asked the stranger.\r\n\r\n7. "For the sake of our good king, Robert Bruce, who, though he is now\r\nhunted like a wild beast, with horn and hound, I trust yet to see on the\r\nthrone of Scotland!"\r\n\r\n8. "Nay, then, my good woman," replied the man, "since you love him so\r\nwell, know that you see him now _I_ am Robert Bruce."\r\n\r\n9. "_You\'!_--are _you_ our king\'?" she inquired, sinking on her knees,\r\nand reverently kissing his hand; "where, then, are your followers, and\r\nwhy are you thus alone?"\r\n\r\n10. "I have no followers now," replied Bruce, "and am, therefore,\r\ncompelled to travel alone."\r\n\r\n11. "Nay, my liege," exclaimed the loyal dame, "that you shall do no\r\nlonger; for here are my two sons, whom I give to you, and may they long\r\nlive to serve and defend your majesty!"\r\n\r\n12. The Scottish youths bent their knees, and took the oath of fealty;\r\nand then, sitting beside the fire, the king entered into conversation\r\nwith his new retainers, while their mother was busied in preparing the\r\nevening meal.\r\n\r\n13. Suddenly, they were startled by the tramp of horses\' hoofs, and the\r\nvoices of men. "\'_Tis the English!_" shouted the matron, "_fight to the\r\nlast, my sons, and defend your king!_" But, at this moment, the king\r\nrecognized the voices of Lord James, of Douglas, and of Edward Bruce,\r\nand bade them have no fear.\r\n\r\n14. Bruce was overjoyed at meeting with his brother, and his faithful\r\nfriend Douglas, who had with them a band of one hundred and fifty men.\r\nHe bade farewell to the brave and loyal woman, and, taking with him her\r\ntwo sons, left the place.\r\n\r\n15. The two young Scots served Bruce well and faithfully, and were high\r\nofficers in his service when, at the head of a conquering army, he drove\r\nthe English invaders from the soil of Scotland, and rendered her again a\r\n_free and independent kingdom_.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

But in _adversity\'s dark hour_\r\n      _Of peril and of fear,_\r\n    When clouds above the vessel lower,\r\n      With scarce one star to cheer;\r\n    When winds are loud, and waves are high,\r\n    And ocean, to a timid eye,\r\n      Appears the seaman\'s grave;\r\n    Amid the conflict, calm, unmoved,\r\n    By truth\'s unerring test is proved\r\n      _The skillful and the brave._\r\n\r\n 3. For Scotland and her freedom\'s right\r\n      The Bruce his part had played;\r\n    _In five successive fields of fight_\r\n      _Been conquered and dismayed._\r\n    _Once more, against the English host_\r\n    _His band he led, and once more lost_\r\n      _The meed for which he fought;_\r\n    And now, from battle faint and worn,\r\n    The homeless fugitive forlorn\r\n      A hut\'s lone shelter sought.\r\n\r\n 4. And cheerless was that resting-place\r\n      For him who claimed a throne;\r\n    His canopy, devoid of grace,--\r\n      The rude, rough beams alone;\r\n    The heather couch his only bed,\r\n    Yet well I know had slumber fled\r\n      From couch of eider down;\r\n    Through darksome night to dawn of day,\r\n    Immersed in wakeful thought he lay,\r\n      Of Scotland and her crown.\r\n\r\n 5. The sun rose brightly, and its gleam\r\n      Fell on that hapless bed,\r\n    And tinged with light each shapeless beam\r\n      Which roofed the lowly shed;\r\n    When, looking up with wistful eye,\r\n    The Bruce beheld a spider try\r\n      His filmy thread to fling\r\n    From beam to beam of that rude cot;\r\n    And well the insect\'s toilsome lot\r\n      Taught Scotland\'s future king.\r\n\r\n 6. Six times his gossamery thread\r\n      The wary spider threw:\r\n    In vain the filmy line was sped;\r\n      For, powerless or untrue,\r\n    Each aim appeared and back recoiled\r\n    The patient insect, _six times foiled_,\r\n      And yet unconquered still;\r\n    And soon the Bruce, with eager eye,\r\n    Saw him prepare once more to try\r\n      His courage, strength, and skill.\r\n\r\n 7. _One effort more, the seventh and last_,--\r\n      The hero hailed the sign!\r\n    And on the wished-for beam hung fast\r\n      The slender, silken line.\r\n    Slight as it was, his spirit caught\r\n    The more than omen; for his thought\r\n      The lesson well could trace,\r\n    Which even "he who runs may read,"\r\n    That _perseverance gains its meed_,\r\n      And _patience wins the race_.\r\n\r\n 8.

Hast thou been long and often foiled\r\n (<)  By adverse wind and seas\'?\r\n    And vainly struggled, vainly toiled,\r\n      For what some win with ease\'?\r\n    Yet bear up heart, and hope, and will,\r\n    Nobly resolved to struggle still,\r\n      With patience persevere;\r\n    Knowing, when darkest seems the night,\r\n    The dawn of morning\'s glorious light\r\n      Is swiftly drawing near.\r\n\r\n10. Art thou a Christian? shall the frown\r\n      Of fortune cause dismay\'?\r\n    The Bruce but won an _earthly crown_,\r\n      Which long hath passed away;\r\n    For thee a _heavenly crown_ awaits;\r\n    For thee are oped the pearly gates,--\r\n      Prepared the deathless palm:\r\n    But bear in mind that _only those_\r\n    _Who persevere unto the close,_\r\n      _Can join in Victory\'s psalm_.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

What a pity it is that we are born under a Republican\r\ngovernment!\r\n\r\n_Horace_. Upon my word, Caroline, that is a patriotic observation for an\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\n_Caroline_. Oh, I know that it is not a _popular_ one! We must all join\r\nin the cry of liberty and equality, and bless our stars that we have\r\nneither kings nor emperors to rule over us, and that our very first\r\naudible squeak was republicanism. If we don\'t join in the shout, and\r\nhang our caps on liberty-poles, we are considered monsters. For my part,\r\nI am _tired_ of it, and am determined to _say what I think_. I _hate_\r\nrepublicanism; I hate liberty and equality; and I don\'t hesitate to\r\n_declare_ that I am for monarchy. You may laugh, but I would say it at\r\nthe stake.\r\n\r\n_Horace_. Bravo, Caroline! You have almost run yourself out of breath.\r\nYou deserve to be prime minister to the king.\r\n\r\n_Caroline_. You mistake; I have no wish to mingle in political broils,\r\nnot even if I could be as renowned as Pitt or Fox; but I must say, I\r\nthink our equality is _odious_. What do you think! To-day, the new\r\nchamber-maid put her head into the door, and said, "Caroline, your marm\r\nwants you!"\r\n\r\n_Horace_. _Excellent!_ I suppose if ours were a _monarchical_\r\ngovernment, she would have bent to the ground, or saluted your little\r\nfoot, before she spoke.\r\n\r\n_Caroline_. No, Horace; you _know_ there are no such forms in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n_Horace_. May I ask your highness what you _would_ like to be?\r\n\r\n_Caroline_. I should like to be a countess.\r\n\r\n_Horace_. Oh, you are moderate in your ambition! A countess, now-a-days,\r\nis the fag-end of nobility.\r\n\r\n_Caroline_. Oh! but it sounds so delightfully,--_"The young Countess\r\nCaroline!"_\r\n\r\n_Horace_. If _sound_ is all, you shall have that pleasure; we will call\r\nyou _the young countess_.\r\n\r\n_Caroline_. That would be mere burlesque, Horace, and would make one\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\n_Horace_. Nothing can be more inconsistent in us, than aiming at titles.\r\n\r\n_Caroline_. For _us_, I grant you; but, if they were _hereditary,_ if we\r\nhad been born to them, if they came to us through belted knights and\r\nhigh-born dames, _then_ we might be proud to wear them. I never shall\r\ncease to regret that I was not born under a monarchy.\r\n\r\n_Horace_. You seem to forget that all are not lords and ladies in\r\n_royal_ dominions. Suppose you should have drawn your first breath among\r\nthe _lower classes_,--suppose it should have been your lot to crouch and\r\nbend, or be trodden under foot by some titled personage, whom in your\r\nheart you despised; what then?\r\n\r\n_Caroline_. You may easily suppose that I did not mean to take _those_\r\nchances. No; I meant to be born among the _higher_ ranks.\r\n\r\n_Horace_. Your own reason must tell you, that _all_ can not be born\r\namong the _higher ranks_; for then the _lower ones_ would be wanting,\r\nwhich constitute the comparison. Now, Caroline, is it not better to be\r\nborn under a government where there are no such ranks, and where _the\r\nonly nobility is talent and virtue\'?_\r\n\r\n_Caroline_. Talent and virtue! I think _wealth_ constitutes our\r\nnobility, and the right of abusing each other, our liberty.\r\n\r\n_Horace_. You are as fond of aphorisms as Lavater[Headnote 1] was.\r\n\r\n_Caroline_. Let me ask you if our rich men, who ride in their own\r\ncarriages, who have fine houses, and who count by millions, are not our\r\n_great_ men?\r\n\r\n_Horace_. They have all the greatness that _money_ can buy; but this is\r\nvery limited.\r\n\r\n_Caroline_. Well, in _my_ opinion, _money is power_.\r\n\r\n_Horace_. You mistake. Money may be _temporary power_, but _talent_ is\r\n_power itself_; and, _when united with virtue, is godlike power_, before\r\nwhich the mere man of millions quails.\r\n\r\n_Caroline_. Well, Horace, I really wish you the possession of _talent_,\r\nand _principle_, and _wealth_ into the bargain. The latter, you think,\r\nwill follow the two former, simply at your beck;--you smile; but _I_\r\nfeel as determined in _my_ way of thinking, as _you_ do in _yours_.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

The purity of his doctrines,\r\nand his independence of character, rendered him popular with the most\r\nenlightened Athenians, though they created him many enemies.

For the\r\ninteresting account of his triumph over Goliath, the great champion of\r\nthe Philistines, see I Sam., chap. 17.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FIRST JACK-KNIFE.\r\n\r\n1. I remember it well! Its horn handle, so smooth and clear, glowing\r\nwith the unmeaning, but magic word, "_Bunkum;_" and the blade\r\nsignificantly inviting you to the test, by the two monosyllables, "_Try\r\nme_."\r\n\r\n2. I know not how it is, but I never could take half the comfort in any\r\nthing which I have since possessed, that I took in this _jack-knife_. I\r\nearned it myself; and, therefore, I had a feeling of independence; it\r\nwas bought with my _own money_,--not teazed out of my uncle, or still\r\nkinder father,--_money_ that I had silently earned on the afternoons of\r\nthose days set apart for boys to amuse themselves.\r\n\r\n3. Yes! with a spirit of persevering industry and self-denial, at which\r\nI now wonder, I went, every afternoon, during "berry-time," and picked\r\nthe ripened fruit with eagerness; for my heart was in the task. I sold\r\nmy berries, and, carefully reserving the proceeds, shortly accumulated\r\nenough to purchase the treasure, for which I so eagerly longed.\r\n\r\n4. I went to one of the village-stores, and requested the clerk to show\r\nme his jack-knives; but he, seeing that I was only a boy, and thinking\r\nthat I merely meant to amuse myself in looking at the nicest, and\r\nwishing it was mine, told me not to plague him, as he was otherwise\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\n5. I turned with indignation; but I felt the inward comfort of a man who\r\nhas _confidence_ in his own resources, and knows he has the power in his\r\nown hands. I quietly jingled the money in my pockets, and went to the\r\nopposite store. I asked for jack-knives, and was shown a lot fresh from\r\nthe city, which were temptingly laid down before me, and left for me to\r\nselect one, while the trader went to another part of his store to wait\r\nupon an older customer. I looked over them, opened them, breathed upon\r\nthe blades, and shut them again.\r\n\r\n6. One was too hard to open, another had no spring; finally, after\r\nexamining them with all the judgment which, in my opinion, the extent of\r\nthe investment required, I selected one with a hole through the handle;\r\nand, after a dissertation with the owner upon jack-knives in general,\r\nand _this one_ in particular,--upon hawk-bill, and dagger-blades,--and\r\nhandles, iron, bone, and buck-horn,--I succeeded in closing a bargain.\r\n\r\n7. I took the instrument I had purchased, and felt a sudden expansion of\r\nmy boyish frame! It was my world! I deposited it in my pocket among\r\nother valuables,--twine, marbles, slate-pencils, &c. I went home to my\r\nfather; I told him how long I had toiled for it, and how eagerly I had\r\nspent time, which others had allotted to play, to possess myself of my\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\n8. My father gently chided me for not telling him of my wants; but I\r\nobserved his glistening eye turn affectionately to my mother and then to\r\nme, and I thought that his manly form seemed to straighten up and to\r\nlook prouder than I had ever before seen him. At any rate, he came to\r\nme, and, patting my curly head, told me there was no object in life,\r\nwhich was reasonably to be desired, that _honesty, self-denial,\r\nwell-directed industry_, and _perseverance_ would not place within my\r\nreach; and if, through life, I carried the spirit of independent\r\nexertion into practice, which I had displayed in the purchase of the\r\njack-knife, I should become a "_great man_."\r\n\r\n9. From that moment, I was a new being. I had discovered that I could\r\n_rely upon myself_. I took my jack-knife, and many a time, while cutting\r\nthe walnut-saplings for my bow, or the straight pine for my arrow, or\r\ncarving my mimic ship, did I muse upon these words of my father,--so\r\ndeeply are the kind expressions of a judicious parent engraven on the\r\nheart and memory of boyhood.\r\n\r\n10. My knife was my constant companion. It was my carpenter, my\r\nship-builder, and my toy-manufacturer. It was out upon all occasions,\r\nnever amiss, and always "handy;" and, as I valued it, I never let it\r\npart from me. I own my selfishness; I would divide my apples among my\r\nplaymates, my whole store of marbles was at their service,--they might\r\nknock my bats, kick my foot-ball as they chose; but I had no partnership\r\nof enjoyments in my jack-knife. Its possession was connected in my mind\r\nwith something so _exclusive_, that I could not permit another to take\r\nit for a moment. Oh! there is a wild and delicious luxury in one\'s\r\nboyish anticipations and youthful day-dreams!\r\n\r\n11. If, however, the _use_ of my jack-knife afforded me pleasure, the\r\nidea of its possession was no less a source of enjoyment. I was, for the\r\ntime being, a little prince among my fellows,--a perfect monarch. Let no\r\none exclaim against aristocracy; were we all perfectly _equal to-day_,\r\nthere would be an _aristocracy to-morrow_. Talent, judgment, skill,\r\ntact, industry, perseverance, will place some on the top, while the\r\ncontrary attributes will place others at the bottom of fortune\'s\r\never-revolving wheel!\r\n\r\n12. The plowman is an aristocrat, if he excels in his vocation: he is an\r\naristocrat, if he turns a better or a straighter furrow than his\r\nneighbor. The poorest poet is an aristocrat, if he writes more\r\nfeelingly, in a purer language, or with more euphonic jingle than his\r\ncotemporaries. The fisherman is an aristocrat, if he wields his harpoon\r\nwith more skill, and hurls it with a deadlier energy than his messmates,\r\nor has even learned to fix his bait more alluringly on his barbed hook.\r\n\r\n13. All _have_ had, and _still_ have their foibles; all have some\r\npossession, upon which they pride themselves, and I was proud of my\r\njack-knife! Spirit of Socrates, [Headnote 1] forgive me! was there no\r\npride in dying like a philosopher\'?

Captain John Hull was the mint-master of Massachusetts, and coined\r\nall the money that was made there. This was a new line of business; for,\r\nin the earlier days of the colony, the current coinage consisted of gold\r\nand silver money of England, Portugal, and Spain.\r\n\r\n2. These coins being scarce, the people were often forced to barter\r\ntheir commodities, instead of selling them. For instance, if a man\r\nwanted to buy a coat, he, perhaps, exchanged a bear-skin for it. If he\r\nwished for a barrel of molasses, he might purchase it with a pile of\r\npine-boards. Musket-bullets were used instead of farthings.\r\n\r\n3. The Indians had a sort of money, called _wampum_, which was made of\r\nclam-shells; and this strange sort of specie was, likewise, taken in\r\npayment of debts, by the English settlers. Bank-bills had never been\r\nheard of. There was not money enough of any kind, in many parts of the\r\ncountry, to pay the salaries of the ministers; so that they sometimes\r\nhad to take quintals of fish, bushels of corn, or cords of wood, instead\r\nof silver or gold.\r\n\r\n4. As the people grew more numerous, and their trade one with another\r\nincreased, the want of current money was still more sensibly felt. To\r\nsupply the demand, the general court passed a law for establishing a\r\ncoinage of shillings, sixpences, and threepences. Captain John Hull was\r\nappointed to manufacture this money, and was to have _one shilling_, out\r\nof every twenty, to pay him for the trouble of making them.\r\n\r\n5. Hereupon, all the old silver in the colony was handed over to Captain\r\nJohn Hull. The battered silver cans, and tankards, and silver-buckles,\r\nand broken spoons, and silver-buttons of worn-out coats, and silver\r\nhilts of swords that had figured at courts,--all such curious old\r\narticles were, doubtless, thrown into the melting-pot together. But by\r\nfar the greater part of the silver consisted of bullion from the mines\r\nof South America, which the English buccaneers, (who were little better\r\nthan pirates,) had taken from the Spaniards, and brought to\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n6. All this old and new silver being melted down and coined, the result\r\nwas an immense amount of splendid shillings, sixpences, and threepences.\r\nEach had the date, 1652, on the one side, and the figure of a\r\n_pine-tree_ on the other. Hence, they were called _pine-tree shillings_.\r\nAnd, for every _twenty shillings_ that he coined, you will remember,\r\nCaptain John Hull was entitled to put _one shilling_ into his own\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n7. The magistrates soon began to suspect that the mint-master would have\r\nthe best of the bargain. They offered him a large sum of money, if he\r\nwould but give up that _twentieth shilling_, which he was continually\r\ndropping into his own pocket. But Captain Hull declared himself\r\nperfectly satisfied with the shilling. And well he might be; for, so\r\ndiligently did he labor, that, in a few years, his pockets, his\r\nmoney-bags, and his strong box, were overflowing with pine-tree\r\nshillings. This was probably the case when he came into possession of\r\nGrandfather\'s chair; and, as he had worked so hard at the mint, it was\r\ncertainly proper that he should have a comfortable chair to rest himself\r\nin.\r\n\r\n8. When the mint-master had grown very rich, a young man, Samuel Sewell\r\nby name, fell in love with his only daughter. His daughter, whom we will\r\ncall Betsey, was a fine, hearty damsel, by no means so slender as some\r\nyoung ladies of our own days. As Samuel was a young man of good\r\ncharacter, industrious in his business, and a member of the church, the\r\nmint-master very readily gave his consent.\r\n\r\n9. "Yes; you may take her," said he, in his rough way; "and you\'ll find\r\nher a heavy burden enough!" On the wedding-day, we may suppose that\r\nhonest John Hull dressed himself in a plum-colored coat, all the buttons\r\nof which were made of pine-tree shillings. The buttons of his waistcoat\r\nwere sixpences; and the knees of his small-clothes were buttoned with\r\nsilver threepences.\r\n\r\n10. Thus attired, he sat with great dignity in Grandfather\'s chair; and,\r\nbeing a portly old gentleman, he completely filled it from elbow to\r\nelbow. On the opposite side of the room, between her bridemaids, sat\r\nMiss Betsey, blushing like a full-blown peony.\r\n\r\n11. There, too, was the bridegroom, dressed in a fine purple coat, and\r\ngold-lace waistcoat, with as much other finery as the Puritan laws and\r\ncustoms would allow him to put on. His hair was cropped close to his\r\nhead, because Governor Endicott had forbidden any man to wear it below\r\nthe ears. But he was a very personable young man; and so thought the\r\nbridemaids and Miss Betsey herself.\r\n\r\n12. The mint-master, also, was pleased with his new son-in-law;\r\nespecially as he had courted Miss Betsey out of pure love, and had said\r\nnothing at all about her portion. So, when the marriage ceremony was\r\nover, Captain Hull whispered a word to two of his men-servants, who\r\nimmediately went out, and soon returned, lugging in a large pair of\r\nscales. They were such a pair as wholesale merchants use for weighing\r\nbulky commodities; and quite a bulky commodity was now to be weighed in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n13. "Daughter Betsey," said the mint-master, "get into one side of these\r\nscales." Miss Betsey, or Mrs. Sewell, as we must now call her, did as\r\nshe was bid, like a dutiful child, without any question of the why and\r\nwherefore. But what her father could mean, unless to make her husband\r\npay for her by the pound, (in which case she would have been a dear\r\nbargain,) she had not the least idea.\r\n\r\n14. "And now," said honest John Hull to the servants, "bring that box\r\nhither." The box, to which the mint-master pointed, was a huge, square,\r\niron-bound, oaken chest. The servants tugged with might and main; but\r\ncould not lift this enormous receptacle, and were finally obliged to\r\ndrag it across the floor.\r\n\r\n15. Captain Hull then took a key from his girdle, unlocked the chest,\r\nand lifted its ponderous lid. Behold! _it was full to the brim of bright\r\npine-tree shillings_, fresh from the mint; and Samuel Sewell began to\r\nthink that his father-in-law had got possession of all the money in the\r\nMassachusetts\' treasury. But it was only the mint-master\'s honest share\r\nof the coinage.\r\n\r\n16. Then the servants, at Captain Hull\'s command, heaped double handfuls\r\nof shillings into one side of the scales, while Betsey remained in the\r\nother. Jingle, jingle, went the shillings, as handful after handful was\r\nthrown in, till, plump and ponderous as she was, they fairly weighed the\r\nyoung lady from the floor.\r\n\r\n17. "There, son Samuel," said the honest mint-master, resuming his seat\r\nin Grandfather\'s chair, "take these shillings for my daughter\'s portion.\r\nUse her kindly, and thank Heaven for her. _It is not every wife that\'s\r\nworth her weight in silver!_"\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

The scene of the poem is laid among the Ojibways, or\r\nChippewas, a tribe of Indians, occupants, from the period of our\r\nearliest history, of the basin of Lake Superior.\r\n\r\n   1.\r\n   Then the little Hiawatha\r\n   Learned of every bird its language,\r\n   Learned their names and all their secrets,\r\n   How they built their nests in summer,\r\n   Where they hid themselves in winter,\r\n   Talked with them where\'er he met them,\r\n   Called them "Hiawatha\'s chickens."\r\n\r\n   2.\r\n   Of all beasts he learned the language,\r\n   Learned their names and all their secrets,\r\n   How the beavers built their lodges,\r\n   Where the squirrels hid their acorns,\r\n   How the reindeer ran so swiftly,\r\n   Why the rabbit was so timid,\r\n   Talked with them whene\'er he met them,\r\n   Called them "Hiawatha\'s brothers."\r\n\r\n   3.\r\n   Then Ia\'goo, the great boaster,\r\n   He, the marvelous story-teller,\r\n   He, the traveler and the talker,\r\n   Made a bow for Hiawatha;\r\n   From a branch of ash he made it,\r\n   From an oak-bough made the arrows,\r\n   Tipped with flint, and winged with feathers,\r\n   And the cord he made of deer-skin.\r\n\r\n   4.\r\n   Then he said to Hiawatha,\r\n   "Go, my son, into the forest,\r\n   Where the red deer herd together,\r\n   Kill for us a famous roebuck,\r\n   Kill for us a deer with antlers."\r\n   Forth into the forest straightway\r\n   All alone walked Hiawatha\r\n   Proudly with his bow and arrows.\r\n\r\n   5.\r\n   And the birds sang round him, o\'er him\r\n   "Do not shoot us, Hiawatha."\r\n   Sang the robin, sang the bluebird,\r\n   "Do not shoot us, Hiawatha."\r\n   Up the oak-tree, close beside him,\r\n   Sprang the squirrel, lightly leaping\r\n   In and out among the branches;\r\n   Coughed and chattered from the oak-tree,\r\n   Laughed, and said between his laughing,\r\n   "Do not shoot me, Hiawatha."\r\n\r\n   6.\r\n   And the rabbit from his pathway\r\n   Leaped aside, and, at a distance,\r\n   Sat erect upon his haunches,\r\n   Half in fear, and half in frolic,\r\n   Saying to the little hunter,\r\n   "Do not shoot me, Hiawatha."\r\n\r\n   7.\r\n   But he heeded not nor heard them,\r\n   For his thoughts were with the red deer;\r\n   On their tracks his eyes were fastened,\r\n   Leading downward to the river,\r\n   To the ford across the river,\r\n   And as one in slumber walked he.\r\n\r\n   8.\r\n   Hidden in the alder bushes,\r\n   There he waited till the deer came,\r\n   Till he saw too antlers lifted,\r\n   Saw two eyes look from the thicket,\r\n   Saw two nostrils point to windward,\r\n   And the deer came down the pathway,\r\n   Flecked with leafy light and shadow.\r\n   And his heart within him fluttered,\r\n   Trembled like the leaves above him,\r\n   Like the birch leaf palpitated,\r\n   As the deer came down the pathway.\r\n\r\n   9.\r\n   Then, upon one knee uprising,\r\n   Hiawatha aimed an arrow;\r\n   Scarce a twig moved with his motion,\r\n   Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled,\r\n   But the wary roebuck started,\r\n   Stamped with all his hoofs together,\r\n   Listened with one foot uplifted,\r\n   Leaped as if to meet the arrow;\r\n   Ah, the singing, fatal arrow,\r\n   Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him.\r\n\r\n   10.\r\n   Dead he lay there in the forest,\r\n   By the ford across the river;\r\n   Beat his timid heart no longer;\r\n   But the heart of Hiawatha\r\n   Throbbed, and shouted, and exulted,\r\n   As he bore the red deer homeward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIX.\r\n\r\n   TRAIL, track; footprints.\r\n   IN\' DICATED, pointed out; shown.\r\n   MURK\' Y, dark; gloomy.\r\n   FLAM\' BEAU, (_flam\' bo_,) lighted torch.\r\n   RE FLECT\' ING, throwing back.\r\n   LU\' RID LY, gloomily; dismally.\r\n   SUS PECT\' ING, mistrusting.\r\n   AS SAIL\' ANTS, assaulters.\r\n   ECH\' O, (_ek\' o_,) sound reverberated.\r\n   RE LAPS\' ED, fell back; returned.\r\n   EN VEL\' OPED, inwrapped.\r\n   SUF FO CATED, smothered.\r\n   BRAND\' ISHING, flourishing; waving.\r\n   RIG\' ID, stiff.\r\n   BIV\' OUAC, (_biv\' wak_,) pass the night without tents.\r\n   PEER\' ED, came in sight; appeared.\r\n   DE CLIV\' I TY, gradual descent.\r\n   PRO LONG\' ED, lengthened; continued.\r\n   COM\' RADE, companion; associate.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DESPERATE ENCOUNTER WITH A PANTHER.\r\n\r\nBOY\'S BOOK OF ADVENTURES.\r\n\r\n1. I had left the hunting party more than an hour, when I came upon the\r\ntrack of my old friend Konwell, who was, with his dogs, on the bloody\r\ntrail of a panther. The animal must have had one of his legs broken;\r\nthis was indicated by the marks on the soft ground; and it was plain\r\nthat the tracks were made by three feet instead of four, and accompanied\r\nby blood at every leap.\r\n\r\n2. I determined to follow; and, after a tramp of nearly an hour, I\r\novertook my friend at the entrance of a cavern, where he stood waiting\r\nfor me. The wounded animal had taken refuge in this cave, leaving us to\r\ndo whatever we thought best. The poor beast doubtless supposed that\r\nwithin this murky recess he was safe from pursuit; but he was mistaken.\r\nKonwell informed me that he had hidden a bundle of pine splinters in a\r\ngulley, about half a mile distant, and that if I would keep guard over\r\nthe mouth of the cave, he would go and bring it.\r\n\r\n3. I agreed to this measure; and, with ready gun and drawn knife,\r\nprepared for any attack that might be made. I lay down at the entrance\r\nof the panther\'s cave. My friend soon returned, bringing the pine, as he\r\nhad promised. His next movement was to kindle a large fire at the mouth\r\nof the cave, at which we lighted our torches; and, having taken the\r\nflambeaus in our left hand, while we carried our guns in the right, we\r\ncautiously entered the cave. I crept on before; but the space within\r\nsoon became so high and roomy, that we could stand upright, and keep\r\nclose to each other.\r\n\r\n4. Bending toward the left, the cavity extended a considerable distance\r\nwithin the hill. After we had advanced about two hundred steps, we saw\r\nthe glaring eyes of the wounded beast, which gleamed forth like two\r\nfiery balls, reflecting most luridly the light of our torches. Konwell\r\nnow took my flambeau and stepped behind me. I leveled my gun in the\r\ndirection of those flaming eyes, and fired. After the report, we heard a\r\nbustle; but could not exactly make out what it meant.\r\n\r\n5. I reloaded my gun, resumed my torch, and Konwell now took his place\r\nin front. But, as those flaming eyes were no longer to be seen, we felt\r\nobliged to go farther. Our guns ready loaded, we believed ourselves to\r\nbe prepared for anything. We proceeded carefully, as men are likely to\r\ndo when suspecting danger, when, instantly, the panther started up from\r\na hollow, in which he was lying, quite close to our feet.\r\n\r\n6. It was a fearful sight to look upon him as he stood with ears laid\r\nback, his white teeth set together, as if in intense anger, and those\r\nwide open eyes glowing and sparkling as they rested upon us, his\r\nassailants. I can never forget his appearance. In a moment our guns were\r\ndischarged, and the cave returned the thundering echo. We had both fired\r\nso precisely at the same moment, that neither of us could believe the\r\nother had discharged his gun.\r\n\r\n7. We were certain that our enemy had been struck, but we knew not\r\nwhether killed or only disabled. Quick as thought, we dropped our guns\r\nand drew our knives from the sheath. And haste was necessary; for the\r\necho had not relapsed into silence, before we felt the weight of the\r\npanther against us; and we began cutting at him with our knives, and, at\r\nthe same moment, in consequence of our hurried movements, our torches\r\ndied out, and we were left in utter darkness.\r\n\r\n8. Deafened by the noise and utterly bewildered, I turned to fly from\r\nthe now raging enemy, and only became perfectly aware of what I was\r\ndoing, when I found myself standing beside Konwell outside the cave in\r\nthe open air. I only know now, that, enveloped in thick darkness, and\r\nalmost suffocated with the smoke of gunpowder, I groped about, not\r\nknowing what I wished or intended; and that Konwell, at last, drew me\r\nforcibly to the mouth of the cave.\r\n\r\n9. There we stood, each one brandishing his hunting-knife in his right\r\nhand, and holding the extinguished torch in the left; as we looked on\r\neach other, we scarcely knew whether to laugh or to be frightened at the\r\nstrange figures we made. We were black with powder-smoke, covered with\r\nsweat and blood, and our clothing torn to rags.\r\n\r\n10. Konwell complained of a pain in his breast. I opened the bosom of\r\nhis shirt, and found two deep gashes made by the panther\'s claws,\r\nextending from the left shoulder to the pit of the stomach. I also\r\nreceived a few scratches, but our stout hunting-shirts were torn to\r\nshreds.\r\n\r\n11. Until this moment, neither of us had felt that he was wounded; and\r\neven now, before we began to think of dressing those wounds, we made a\r\nlarge fire at the mouth of the cavern, in order to prevent the panther\r\nfrom coming forth. This done, we sat down beside the genial blaze to\r\nwash and bind up our scratches, and consult on what plan it was now best\r\nto proceed.\r\n\r\n12. That the panther was still in the cave we were certain; but, whether\r\nliving or dead, we did not know; at all events, he was wounded; for our\r\nhunting-knives were covered with blood quite up to the hilt. But we had\r\nno choice left; we must return; for our guns and Konwell\'s powder-flask,\r\nwhich the animal dragged off with him, still lay within the cavern. We\r\ntherefore plucked up new courage; and, having relighted our torches, we\r\nbrandished our knives, and prepared, though not without some heart\r\nthrobbings, once more to enter the panther\'s den.\r\n\r\n13. With light and cautious steps, lest we might be as unpleasantly\r\nsurprised as we had been when we made our hasty retreat, we advanced,\r\nholding our torches before us, to the spot where we had dropped our\r\nguns, and without meeting with any hinderance from our enemy. Once more\r\nin possession of our trusty weapons, we reloaded them, and stepped\r\nforward with lighter hearts, yet still with great caution, when Konwell\r\nexclaimed, as he raised the flaming pine high above his head, and\r\npointed with it in a certain direction, "_See! there he is!_"\r\n\r\n14. This was the first word that had been spoken since we reentered the\r\ncavern. I looked in the indicated direction, and there, indeed, lay the\r\npanther, stretched out at full length, but no longer dangerous. His eyes\r\nwere set, his limbs were rigid,--the last agony was over. We skinned and\r\ncut him up as he lay. All three bullets had struck him, and both knives\r\npenetrated his body; and it must have been in the death-struggle that he\r\nleaped upon us.\r\n\r\n15. When our work was ended, and we again came to the open air, the sun\r\nwas low in the horizon, and all haste was necessary that we should set\r\nout on our forest-path without further delay. Our wounds smarted not a\r\nlittle, and, although we took time once more to wash them, they became\r\nso stiff that our progress was both toilsome and tedious. We soon became\r\nconvinced that we should not succeed in reaching our companions while\r\ndaylight remained, and we determined to bivouac for the night, at the\r\nfoot of a rocky declivity, which promised a good shelter from the\r\ncutting wind.\r\n\r\n16. To add to our discomfort, hunger began to make itself painfully\r\nfelt; but this was soon overpowered by weariness, and, having gathered\r\nup the dry pine branches, we kindled up a good fire, and, without\r\ntroubling ourselves to prepare any thing for supper, we stretched\r\nourselves on the grass before it, and found the warmth most grateful.\r\n\r\n17. Worn out by the toils of the day, in a few minutes Konwell was fast\r\nasleep; but, although much inclined to follow his example, I was\r\nprevented by the restlessness of my dog, which seemed to wish to warn me\r\nof the presence of danger. The faithful animal, cringing closely to me,\r\nlaid his nose on my shoulder, raising his head from time to time, and\r\nwhined, as though he wished to communicate something, and then, for a\r\nfew moments, would remain quiet. Then, suddenly, he would rise up as in\r\nthe attitude of listening, occasionally uttering a low growl.\r\n\r\n18. Completely awakened by this strange behavior on the part of my\r\nfaithful dog, it seemed to me as if I heard a slight rustling among the\r\ndry bushes; and, rising up to a half-sitting posture, I looked toward\r\nthe rock behind me, and, to my great astonishment, became aware of a\r\npair of glaring eyes fastened upon me. As my head was between the fire\r\nand those fearful eyes, I could plainly distinguish the fiery balls as,\r\nreflected on by the red light, they peered above the naked rocks.\r\n\r\n19. It was a panther, and evidently, from the position in which I saw\r\nit, was ready for a spring. Happily on this, as on every other night, my\r\ntrusty gun lay close beside me. I seized it, and, half-rising, so that\r\nthe fire behind me afforded light for a steady aim, I leveled it exactly\r\nbetween the eyes. I fired, the bullet sped on its deadly errand, and the\r\ncrack of the noble rifle, thundering against the steep rocks, returned\r\nwith loud and prolonged echo.\r\n\r\n20. Konwell, to whom the report of a gun was ever the sweetest music,\r\nnow started up, as if roused by an electric shock, and grasped his gun.\r\nThe dog continued his barking, smelling all around, and looking in my\r\nface as if to inquire in what direction he should go. There was no\r\nrustling movement on the rock, and the bullet must have taken effect.\r\n\r\n21. Konwell shook his head as he inquired, "Why I had shot?" Without\r\nanswering, I began to reload my gun: this finished, I took up a blazing\r\npine brand from the fire, and proceeded to climb the steep wall of rock,\r\nthat raised itself like a barrier, about twenty steps distant from the\r\nspot upon which we rested. Here I found an old panther, the largest I\r\nhad ever seen, lying dead--my well-directed bullet had finished him. I\r\nflung the body over the rock, and my old comrade dragged him to the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n22. The ball had struck him directly in the right eye, passing through\r\nthe brain. He was a fearful-looking animal, with terrible teeth and\r\nclaws, and the more to be dreaded, as, when we cut him up, his stomach\r\nwas found entirely empty. I believed that hunger had driven him so close\r\nto the fire; but Konwell thought he had scented the fresh venison we had\r\nwith us.

GOUGH.\r\n\r\n1. I remember once riding from Buffalo to the Niagara Palls. I said to a\r\ngentleman, "What river is that, sir?" "That," said he, "is Niagara\r\nriver."\r\n\r\n2. "Well, it is a beautiful stream," said I; "bright, and fair, and\r\nglassy. How far off are the rapids?" "Only a mile or two," was the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n3. "Is it _possible_ that only a mile from us, we shall find the water\r\nin the turbulence which it must show near the Falls\'?"\r\n\r\n"You will find it so, sir." And so I found it; and the first sight of\r\nNiagara I shall never forget.\r\n\r\n4. Now, launch your bark on that Niagara river; it is bright, smooth,\r\nbeautiful, and glassy. There is a ripple at the bow; the silver wake you\r\nleave behind, adds to your enjoyment. Down the stream you glide, oars,\r\nsails, and helm in proper trim, and you set out on your pleasure\r\nexcursion.\r\n\r\n5. Suddenly, some one cries out from the bank, "_Young men, ahoy!_"\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"_The rapids are below you!_"\r\n\r\n6. "Ha! ha! we have heard of the rapids; but we are not such fools as to\r\nget there. If we go too fast, then we shall up with the helm, and steer\r\nto the shore; we will set the mast in the socket, hoist the sail, and\r\nspeed to the land. Then on, boys; don\'t be alarmed,--there is no\r\ndanger."\r\n\r\n7. "Young men, ahoy there!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"_The rapids are below you!_"\r\n\r\n8. "Ha! ha! we will laugh and quaff; all things delight us. What care we\r\nfor the future! No man ever saw it. Sufficient for the day is the evil\r\nthereof. We will enjoy life while we may,--will catch pleasure as it\r\nflies. This is enjoyment; time enough to steer out of danger when we are\r\nsailing swiftly with the current."\r\n\r\n9 (_ff._) "YOUNG MEN, AHOY!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"BEWARE! BEWARE!

Horace and Herman, two young men who were friends, set out to travel\r\nin distant countries. Before they departed, each had formed a _plan_ of\r\nproceeding. Horace determined to give himself up entirely to\r\n_pleasure,_--to go wherever his humor might dictate,--and to keep no\r\nrecords of his adventures. In short, he resolved to _enjoy himself_ as\r\nmuch as possible, and, by no means, to encumber his mind with cares,\r\nduties, or troubles of any kind.\r\n\r\n2. Herman was as fond of amusement as Horace; but the _mode_ he adopted\r\nfor the gratification of his wishes, was quite different. In the first\r\nplace, he made out a scheme of his travels: he procured maps, read\r\nbooks, and, after mature deliberation, adopted a certain route, as most\r\nlikely to afford him pleasure as well as instruction.\r\n\r\n3. In the formation of this plan, he spent several weeks; and, in this\r\noccupation, he found quite as much satisfaction as he afterwards did in\r\ntraveling. Thus he obtained one great advantage over his idle and\r\nluxurious friend, who foolishly thought that the essence of enjoyment\r\nlay in freedom from thought, restraint, and toil. Even before they set\r\nout on their journey, Herman had actually found nearly as _much_\r\npleasure as Horace received in the whole course of his expedition.\r\n\r\n4. The two young men started together; and, as there were then no canals\r\nor railroads, they both set out on foot. They had not proceeded far\r\nbefore they separated,--Horace taking one road and Herman another.\r\n\r\n5. After the lapse of three years, they both returned; but what a\r\ndifference between them! Horace was morose and dissatisfied; he had seen\r\na good deal of the world, but, as he had traveled with no other design\r\nthan to _gratify himself_ from hour to hour, he had soon exhausted the\r\ncup of pleasure, and found nothing at the bottom but the bitter dregs of\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\n6. He pursued pleasure, till, at last, he found the pursuit to be\r\ndistasteful and revolting. He grew tired even of amusement. He indulged\r\nhis tastes, humors, and passions, until indulgence itself was\r\ndisgusting. When he returned to his friends, he had laid up nothing in\r\nhis memory, by the relation of which he could amuse them; he had kept no\r\nrecord of things he had seen; he brought back no store of pleasing and\r\nuseful recollections for himself, or others. Such was the result of\r\nthree years\' travel for pleasure.\r\n\r\n7. It was quite otherwise with Herman. Adhering to his plans, he visited\r\na great many places, and, each day, he recorded in his journal what he\r\nhad seen. Whenever he met with an interesting object, he stopped to\r\ncontemplate it. If it was some aged relic, famous in history, he took\r\npains to investigate its story, and to write it down. If it was an\r\nobject of interest to the eye, he made a sketch of it in a book which he\r\nkept for that purpose.\r\n\r\n8. In this way, Herman accomplished three good objects. In the first\r\nplace, by taking pleasure in a moderate way, and mixing with it a little\r\ntoil and industry, he prevented that cloying surfeit which, at last,\r\nsickened and disgusted Horace.\r\n\r\n9. In the second place, he greatly increased his enjoyments by the plan\r\nhe adopted. Merely executing a plan is agreeable, and a source of great\r\npleasure. It is natural to derive happiness from following out a\r\ndesign,--from seeing, hour by hour, day by day, how results come about,\r\nin conformity to our intentions.\r\n\r\n10. But _this_ was not the _only_ advantage which Herman received from\r\nhis system. The very toil he bestowed; the investigations he made; the\r\npleasant thoughts and curious knowledge that were unfolded to his mind;\r\nthe excitement he found in his exertions; the pleasure he took in\r\ndrawing picturesque scenes; _all_ constituted a rich harvest of\r\npleasure, which was wholly denied to Horace.\r\n\r\n11. Thus it was that labor and industry, exerted in carrying out a plan,\r\nafforded the young traveler a vast deal of gratification. The very\r\nthings that Horace looked upon as hateful, were, in fact, the sources of\r\nhis friend\'s most permanent enjoyment.\r\n\r\n12. In the third place, Herman had come back laden with rich stores of\r\nknowledge, observation, and experience. Not only was his journal rich in\r\ntales, legends, scenes, incidents, and historical records, but in\r\nputting these things down on paper, his memory had been improved, and he\r\nhad acquired the habit of observing and remembering. His mind was full\r\nof pleasant things, and nothing could be more interesting than to hear\r\nhim tell of his travels, and of what he had seen.\r\n\r\n13. While Horace was dull, silent, and sour, Herman was full of\r\nconversation, life, and interest. The one was happy\', the other\r\nunhappy`; one was agreeable\', the other disagreeable`; one had exhausted\r\nthe cup of pleasure\', the other seemed always to have the cup full and\r\nsparkling before him`. It was agreed on all hands that Horace was a\r\ndisagreeable person, and everybody shunned him; while Herman was\r\nconsidered by all a most agreeable companion, and everybody sought his\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n14. So much for the two travelers; _one_, a luxurious lover of pleasure,\r\nwho thought only of the passing moment, and, in his folly, abused and\r\nthrew away his powers of enjoyment; the _other_, a lover of pleasure\r\nalso; but who pursued it moderately, with a wise regard to the future,\r\nand careful attention, every day, to the rules of duty; and who thus\r\nsecured his true happiness.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

It lifts the soul of man from\r\nlow and groveling pursuits, to the achievement of great and noble deeds,\r\nand ever keeps the object of his aspiration in view, till his most\r\nsanguine expectations are fully realized.\r\n\r\n2. HIGHER! lisps the infant that clasps its parent\'s knee, and makes its\r\nfeeble effort to rise from the floor. It is the first inspiration of\r\nchildhood to burst the narrow confines of the cradle, and to exercise\r\nthose feeble, tottering limbs, which are to walk forth in the\r\nstateliness of manhood.\r\n\r\n3. HIGHER! echoes the proud school-boy in his swing; or, as he climbs\r\nthe tallest tree of the forest, that he may look down upon his less\r\nadventurous comrades with a flush of exultation,--and abroad over the\r\nfields, the meadows, and his native village.\r\n\r\n4. HIGHER! earnestly breathes the student of philosophy and nature. He\r\nhas a host of rivals; but he must excel them all. The midnight oil burns\r\ndim; but he finds light and knowledge in the lamps of heaven, and his\r\nsoul is never weary, when the last of them is hid by the splendors of\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n5. And HIGHER! his voice thunders forth, when the dignity of manhood has\r\nmantled his form, and the multitude is listening with delight to his\r\noracles, burning with eloquence, and ringing like true steel in the\r\ncause of _Freedom_ and _Right_. And when time has changed his locks to\r\nsilver,--when the young and the old unite to do him honor, he still\r\nbreathes forth from his generous heart fond wishes for their welfare.\r\n\r\n6. HIGHER YET! He has reached the apex of earthly honor; yet his spirit\r\nburns as warm as in youth, though with a steadier and purer light. And\r\neven now, while his frail tenement begins to admonish him, that "the\r\ntime of his departure is at hand," he looks forward, with rapturous\r\nanticipation, to the never-fading glory, attainable only in the presence\r\nof the Most High.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

"How far is it from here to the sun?" asked Harmon Lee of his\r\nfather\'s apprentice, James Wallace, intending by the question to elicit\r\nsome reply that would exhibit the boy\'s ignorance.\r\n\r\n2. James Wallace, a boy of fourteen, turned his bright, intelligent eyes\r\nupon the son of his employer, and replied, "I don\'t know, Harmon. How\r\nfar is it?"\r\n\r\n3. There was something so honest and earnest in the tone of the boy,\r\nthat, much as Harmon had felt disposed, at first, to sport with his\r\nignorance, he could not refrain from giving him a true answer. Still,\r\nhis contempt for the ignorant apprentice was not to be concealed, and he\r\nreplied, "_Ninety-five millions of miles_, you ignoramus!" James did not\r\nretort; but, repeating over in his mind the distance named, fixed it\r\nindelibly upon his memory.\r\n\r\n4. On the same evening, after he had finished his day\'s work, he\r\nobtained a small text-book on astronomy, which belonged to Harmon Lee,\r\nand went up into his garret with a candle, and there, alone, attempted\r\nto dive into the mysteries of that sublime science. As he read, the\r\nearnestness of his attention fixed nearly every fact upon his mind. So\r\nintent was he, that he perceived not the flight of time, until the\r\ntown-clock struck ten.\r\n\r\n5. He lay down upon his hard bed, and gave full scope to his thoughts.\r\nHour after hour passed away, but he could not sleep, so absorbed was he\r\nin reviewing the new and wonderful things he had read. At last, wearied\r\nnature gave way, and he fell into a slumber, filled with dreams of\r\nplanets, moons, comets, and fixed stars.\r\n\r\n6. The next morning the apprentice boy resumed his place at the\r\nwork-bench with a new feeling; and, with _this_ feeling, was mingled one\r\nof regret, that he could not go to school as well as Harmon.\r\n\r\n"But I can study at night, while he is asleep," he said to himself.\r\n\r\n7. Just then Harmon Lee came into the shop, and, approaching James,\r\nsaid, for the purpose of teasing him, "How big round is the earth,\r\nJames?"\r\n\r\n"_Twenty-five thousand miles,_" was the quick reply.\r\n\r\n8. Harmon looked surprised, for a moment, and then responded, with a\r\nsneer,--for he was not a kind-hearted boy, but, on the contrary, very\r\nselfish, and disposed to _injure_ rather than _do good_ to others,--"Oh!\r\nhow wonderfully wise you are all at once! And no doubt you can tell how\r\nmany moons Jupiter has? Come, let us hear."\r\n\r\n9. "Jupiter has four moons," James answered, with something of\r\nexultation in his tone.\r\n\r\n"And, no doubt, you can tell how many rings it has?"\r\n\r\n"Jupiter has no rings. Saturn has rings, and Jupiter belts," James\r\nreplied, in a decisive tone.\r\n\r\n10. For a moment or two Harmon was silent with surprise and\r\nmortification, to think that his father\'s _apprentice_, whom he esteemed\r\nso far below him, should be possessed of knowledge equal to his, and on\r\nthe points in reference to which he had chosen to question him,--and\r\nthat he should be able to convict him of an error, into which he had\r\npurposely fallen.\r\n\r\n11. "I should like to know how long it is since you became so\r\nwonderfully wise," said Harmon, with a sneer.\r\n\r\n"Not very long," James replied calmly. "I have been reading one of your\r\nbooks on astronomy."\r\n\r\n12. "I should like to know what business _you_ have to touch one of _my_\r\nbooks! You had better be minding your work."\r\n\r\n"I did not neglect it, Harmon; I read at _night_, after I was done with\r\nmy work; and I did not hurt your book."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care if you _didn\'t_ hurt it. You are not going to have _my_\r\nbooks, I can tell you. So, you just let them alone."\r\n\r\n13. Poor James\'s heart sank within him at this unexpected obstacle, so\r\nsuddenly thrown in his way. He had no money of his own to buy, and knew\r\nof no one from whom he could borrow the book, that had become so\r\nnecessary to his happiness. "Do, Harmon," he said, "lend me the book; I\r\nwill take good care of it."\r\n\r\n"No; I will not. And don\'t you dare to touch it," was the angry reply.\r\n\r\n14. James Wallace knew well enough the selfish disposition of Harmon, to\r\nbe convinced that there was now but little hope of his having the use of\r\nhis books, except by stealth; and from that his naturally open and\r\nhonest principles revolted. All day he thought earnestly of the means\r\nwhereby he should be able to obtain a book on astronomy, to quench the\r\nardent thirst he had created in his own mind.\r\n\r\n15. He was learning the trade of a blind-maker. Having been already an\r\napprentice for two years, and being industrious and intelligent, he had\r\nacquired a readiness with tools, and much skill in some parts of his\r\ntrade. While sitting alone, after he had finished his work for the day,\r\nit occurred to him that he might, by working in the evening, earn some\r\nmoney, and with it buy such books as he wanted.\r\n\r\n16. By consent of his employer, he succeeded in getting a small job,\r\nfrom one of his neighbors; and, in a short time, by working evenings, he\r\nobtained sufficient money to purchase a book of his own, and had a half\r\ndollar left, with which he bought a second-hand dictionary. Every night\r\nfound him poring over his books; and, as soon as it was light enough in\r\nthe morning to see, he was up and reading. During the day, his mind was\r\npondering over the things he had read, while his hands were diligently\r\nemployed in the labor assigned him.\r\n\r\n17. It occurred, just at this time, that a number of benevolent\r\nindividuals established, in the town where James lived, one of those\r\nexcellent institutions, an Apprentices\' Library. To this he applied, and\r\nobtained the books he needed. And thus, did this poor apprentice boy lay\r\nthe foundation of future eminence and usefulness. At the age of\r\ntwenty-one, he was master of his trade; and, what was more, had laid up\r\na vast amount of general and scientific information.\r\n\r\n18. Let us now turn to mark the progress of the young student, Harmon\r\nLee, in one of the best seminaries in his native city, and afterwards at\r\ncollege. The idea that he was to be a lawyer, soon took possession of\r\nhis mind, and this caused him to feel contempt for other boys, who were\r\nmerely designed for trades or store-keeping.\r\n\r\n19. Like too many others, he had no love for learning. To be a _lawyer_\r\nhe thought would be much more honorable than to be a mere mechanic; and,\r\nfor this reason _alone_, he desired to be one. As for James Wallace, the\r\npoor illiterate apprentice, he was most heartily despised, and never\r\ntreated by Harmon with the least degree of kind consideration.\r\n\r\n20. At the age of eighteen, Harmon was sent away to one of the eastern\r\nuniversities, and there remained until he was twenty years of age, when\r\nhe graduated, and came home with the honorary title of Bachelor of Arts.\r\nOn the very day that James completed his term of apprenticeship, Harmon\r\nwas admitted to the bar.\r\n\r\n21. From some cause, James determined he would make law _his_\r\nprofession. To the acquirement of a knowledge of legal matters,\r\ntherefore, he bent all the energies of a well disciplined mind. Two\r\nyears passed away in an untiring devotion to the studies he had assigned\r\nhimself, and he then made application for admission to the bar.\r\n\r\n22. Young Wallace passed his examinations with some applause, and the\r\nfirst case on which he was employed, chanced to be one of great\r\ndifficulty, which required all his skill; the lawyer on the opposite\r\nside was Harmon Lee, who entertained for his father\'s apprentice the\r\nutmost contempt.\r\n\r\n23. The cause came on. There was a profound silence and a marked\r\nattention and interest, when the young stranger arose in the court-room\r\nto open the case. A smile of contempt curled the lip of Harmon Lee, but\r\nWallace saw it not. The prominent points of the case were presented in\r\nplain, but concise language to the court; and a few remarks bearing upon\r\nits merits being made, the young lawyer took his seat, and gave room for\r\nthe defense.\r\n\r\n24. Instantly Harmon Lee was on his feet, and began referring to the\r\npoints presented by his "very learned brother," in a very flippant\r\nmanner. There were those present who marked the light that kindled in\r\nthe eye of Wallace, and the flash that passed over his countenance at\r\nthe first contemptuous word and tone that were uttered by his antagonist\r\nat the bar. These soon gave place to attention, and an air of conscious\r\npower. Nearly an hour had passed when Harmon resumed his seat with a\r\nlook of exultation, which was followed by a pitying and contemptuous\r\nsmile, as Wallace again slowly rose.\r\n\r\n25. Ten minutes, however, had not passed when that smile had changed to\r\na look of surprise, mortification, and alarm. The young lawyer\'s first\r\nspeech showed him to be a man of calm, deep, systematic thought,--well\r\nskilled in points of law and in authorities,--and, more than all, a\r\nlawyer of practical and comprehensive views. When he sat down, no\r\nimportant point in the case had been left untouched, and none that had\r\nbeen touched, required further elucidation.\r\n\r\n20. Lee followed briefly, in a vain attempt to torture his language and\r\nbreak down his positions. But he felt that he was contending with\r\nweapons whose edges were turned at every blow. When he took his seat\r\nagain, Wallace merely remarked that he was prepared, without further\r\nargument, to submit the case to the court.\r\n\r\n27. The case was accordingly submitted, and a decision unhesitatingly\r\nmade in favor of the plaintiff, or Wallace\'s client. From that hour\r\nJames Wallace took his true position. _The despised apprentice became\r\nthe able and profound lawyer,_ and was esteemed for real talent and real\r\nmoral worth, which, when combined, ever place their possessor in his\r\ntrue position. Ten years from that day, Wallace was elevated to the\r\nbench, while Lee, a second-rate lawyer, never rose above that position.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

"Oh, you\'re a _\'prentice!_" said a little boy, the other day,\r\ntauntingly, to his companion. The boy addressed turned proudly round,\r\nand, while the fire of injured pride, and the look of pity were\r\nstrangely blended in his countenance, coolly answered, "_So was\r\nFranklin!_"\r\n\r\n2. This dignified reply struck me forcibly, and I turned to mark the\r\ndisputants more closely. The former, I perceived by his dress, was of a\r\nhigher class in society than his humble, yet more dignified companion.\r\nThe latter was a sprightly, active lad, scarce twelve years old, and\r\ncoarsely, but neatly attired. But, young as he was, there was visible in\r\nhis countenance much of genius, manly dignity, and determinate\r\nresolution; while that of the former showed only fostered pride, and the\r\nimagined superiority of riches.\r\n\r\n3. That little fellow, thought we, gazing at our young hero, displays\r\nalready much of the man, though his calling be a humble one; and, though\r\npoverty extends to him her dreary, cheerless reality, still he looks on\r\nthe brightest side of the scene, and already rises in anticipation from\r\npoverty and wretchedness! Once, "_so was Franklin_" and the world may\r\none day witness in our little "_\'prentice_" as great a philosopher as\r\nthey have already seen in his noble pattern! And we passed on, buried in\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\n4. The motto of our infantile philosopher contains much,--too much to be\r\nforgotten, and should be engraven on the minds of all. What can better\r\ncheer man in a humble calling, than the reflection that the greatest and\r\nthe best of earth--the greatest statesmen, the brightest philosophers,\r\nand the proudest warriors--have once graced the same profession?\r\n\r\n5.\r\n   "Look at Franklin! He who\r\n   With the thunder talked, as friend to friend,\r\n   And wove his garland of the lightning\'s wing,\r\n   In sportive twist."\r\n\r\nWhat was he? A _printer!_ once a subordinate in a printing office!\r\nPoverty stared him in the face; but her blank, hollow look, could\r\nnothing daunt him. He struggled against a harder current than most are\r\ncalled to encounter; but he did not yield. He pressed manfully onward;\r\nbravely buffeted misfortune\'s billows, and gained the desired haven!\r\n\r\n6. Look at Cincinnatus! At the call of his country he laid aside the\r\nplow and seized the sword. But having wielded it with success, when his\r\ncountry was no longer endangered, and public affairs needed not his\r\nlonger stay, "he beat his sword Into a ploughshare," and returned with\r\nhonest delight to his little farm.\r\n\r\n7. Look at Washington! What was his course of life? He was first a\r\n_farmer;_ next a _Commander in Chief_ of the hosts of freedom, fighting\r\nfor the liberation of his country from the thralls of despotic\r\noppression; next, called to the highest seat of government by his\r\nransomed brethren, a _President of the largest Republic on earth_, and\r\nlastly, a _farmer_ again.\r\n\r\n8. What was the famous Ben Jonson? He was first a _brick-layer, or\r\nmason!_ What was he in after years? \'Tis needless to answer.\r\n\r\nWhat was Burns? An Ayrshire _plowman!_ What was he in after life, in the\r\nestimation of his countrymen, and the world? Your library gives the\r\nanswer!\r\n\r\n9. But shall we go on, and call up, in proud array, all the mighty host\r\nof worthies that have lived and died, who were cradled in the lap of\r\npenury, and received their first lessons in the school of affliction\'?\r\nNay\'; we have cited instances enough already,--yea, more than enough to\r\nprove the point in question--namely, _that there is no profession,\r\nhowever low in the opinion of the world, but has been honored with\r\nearth\'s greatest and worthiest._\r\n\r\n10. Young man! Does the iron hand of misfortune press hard upon you, and\r\ndisappointments well-nigh sink your despairing soul\'? Have courage!\r\nMighty ones have been your predecessors, and have withstood the current\r\nof opposition that threatened to overwhelm their fragile bark.\r\n\r\n11. Do you despise your humble station, and repine that Providence has\r\nnot placed you in some nobler sphere\'? Murmur not against the\r\ndispensations of an All-wise Creator! Remember that wealth is no\r\ncriterion of moral rectitude or intellectual worth,--that riches\r\ndishonestly gained, are a lasting curse,--that virtue and uprightness\r\nwork out a rich reward,--and that\r\n\r\n  "An honest man\'s the noblest work of God."\r\n\r\n12. And when dark Disappointment comes, do not wither at her stare; but\r\npress forward, and the prize is yours! It was thus with _Franklin_,--it\r\ncan be thus with _you_. He strove for the prize, and he won it!

In the early part of the war, a sergeant and twelve armed men\r\nundertook a journey through the wilderness, in the State of New\r\nHampshire. Their route was remote from any settlement, and they were\r\nunder the necessity of encamping over night in the woods. Nothing\r\nmaterial happened the first day of their excursion; but, early in the\r\nafternoon of the second, they, from an eminence, discovered a body of\r\narmed Indians advancing toward them, whose number rather exceeded their\r\nown.\r\n\r\n2. As soon as the whites were perceived by their red brethren, the\r\nlatter made signals, and the two parties approached each other in an\r\namicable manner. The Indians appeared to be much gratified with meeting\r\nthe sergeant and his men, whom, they observed, they considered as their\r\nprotectors. They said they belonged to a tribe which had raised the\r\nhatchet with zeal in the cause of liberty, and were determined to do all\r\nin their power to repel the common enemy.\r\n\r\n3. They shook hands in friendship. When they had conversed with each\r\nother for some time, and exchanged mutual good wishes, they, at length,\r\nseparated, and each party traveled in a different direction. After\r\nproceeding to the distance of a mile or more, the sergeant, who was\r\nacquainted with all the different tribes, and knew on which side of the\r\ncontest they were respectively ranked, halted his men, and addressed\r\nthem in the following words:\r\n\r\n4. "My brave companions, we must use the utmost caution, or this night\r\nmay be our last. Should we not make some extraordinary exertions to\r\ndefend ourselves, to-morrow\'s sun may find us sleeping, never to wake.\r\nYou are surprised, comrades, at my words, and your anxiety will not be\r\nlessened, when I inform you that we have just passed _our most\r\ninveterate foe_, who, under the mask of pretended friendship, which you\r\nhave witnessed, would lull us to security, and, by such means, in the\r\nunguarded moments of our midnight slumber, without resistance, seal our\r\nfate."\r\n\r\n5. The men with astonishment listened to this short harangue; and their\r\nsurprise was greater, as not one of them had entertained the suspicion\r\nbut that they had just encountered friends. They all immediately\r\nresolved to enter into some scheme for their mutual preservation, and\r\nthe destruction of their enemies. By the proposal of their leader, the\r\nfollowing plan was adopted and executed.\r\n\r\n6. The spot selected for their night\'s encampment, was near a stream of\r\nwater, which served to cover their rear. They felled a large tree,\r\nbefore which, on the approach of night, a brilliant fire was lighted.\r\nEach individual cut a log of wood, about the size of his body, rolled it\r\nnicely in his blanket, placed his hat upon one end, and laid it before\r\nthe fire, that the enemy might be deceived, and mistake it for a man.\r\n\r\n7. After they had thus fitted out logs, equal in number to the\r\nsergeant\'s party, and had so artfully arranged them, that they might be\r\neasily mistaken for so many soldiers, the men with loaded muskets placed\r\nthemselves behind the fallen tree, by which time the shades of evening\r\nbegan to close around. The fire was kept burning brilliantly until late\r\nin the evening, when it was suffered to decline.\r\n\r\n8. The critical time was now approaching, when an attack might be\r\nexpected from the Indians; but the sergeant\'s men rested in their place\r\nof concealment with great anxiety, till near midnight, without\r\nperceiving any movement of the enemy. At length, a tall Indian was\r\ndiscovered, through the glimmering of the fire, cautiously moving toward\r\nthem, making no noise, and apparently using every means in his power to\r\nconceal himself from any one about the camp.\r\n\r\n9. For a time, his actions showed him to be suspicious that a guard\r\nmight be stationed to watch any unusual appearance, who would give the\r\nalarm in case of danger; but, all appearing quiet, he ventured forward\r\nmore boldly, rested upon his toes, and was distinctly seen to move his\r\nfinger as he numbered each log of wood, or what he supposed to be a\r\nhuman being quietly enjoying repose.\r\n\r\n10. To satisfy himself more fully, as to the number, he counted them\r\nover a second time, and cautiously retired. He was succeeded by another\r\nIndian, who went through the same movements, and retired in the same\r\nmanner. Soon after, the whole party, sixteen in number, were discovered\r\napproaching, and greedily eyeing their supposed victims.\r\n\r\n11. The feelings of the sergeant\'s men can be better imagined than\r\ndescribed, when they saw the base and cruel purpose of their enemies,\r\nwho were now so near that they could scarcely be restrained from firing\r\nupon them. The plan, however, of the sergeant, was to have his men\r\nremain silent in their places of concealment, till the muskets of the\r\nsavages were discharged, that their own fire might be effectual, and\r\nopposition less formidable.\r\n\r\n12. Their suspense was not of long duration. The Indians, in a body,\r\ncautiously approached till within a short distance: they then halted,\r\ntook deliberate aim, discharged their pieces upon inanimate logs, gave a\r\ndreadful war-whoop, and instantly rushed forward, with tomahawk and\r\nscalping knife in hand, to dispatch the living, and obtain the scalps of\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\n13. As soon as they had collected in close order, more effectually to\r\nexecute their horrid intentions, the sergeant\'s party discharged their\r\npieces, not on logs of wood, but perfidious savages,--many of whom fell\r\nunder the hot fire of the little band, and the rest precipitately fled.\r\nBut for this ingenious scheme, it is probable that not one of these\r\ntwelve men would have escaped the tomahawk of the savages.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

A combined Indian and Tory force\r\nhad flung itself upon the peaceful valley, and murdered or made captive\r\nnearly all its unoffending inhabitants; its old and its young,--men,\r\nwomen, and children alike,--were either indiscriminately butchered or\r\nmade prisoners. Among the prisoners taken on that occasion, was an\r\ninfant child by the name of Frances Slocum. The story is a very strange\r\none; we copy it from Lossing\'s very excellent work, "The Field Book of\r\nthe Revolution."]\r\n\r\nB.J. LOSSING.\r\n\r\n1. I passed the evening with the venerable Joseph Slocum, whose family\r\nwas among the sufferers, in Wyoming Valley. He related to me all the\r\nparticulars of the capture and final discovery of his sister Frances,\r\nand other incidents connected with the sufferings of his family.\r\n\r\n2. His father was a Quaker, and was distinguished for his kindness to\r\nthe Indians. He remained unharmed at the time of the invasion, and,\r\nwhile the torch was applied to the dwellings of others, _his_ was left\r\nuntouched. But his son Giles was in the battle. This, doubtless, excited\r\nthe ire of the Indians, and they resolved on vengeance. 3. Late in the\r\nautumn, they were seen prowling about the house, which was situated\r\nabout one hundred rods from the Wilkesbarre Fort. A neighbor, named\r\nKingsley, had been made prisoner, and his wife and two sons had a\r\nwelcome home in Mr. Slocum\'s family. One morning, the boys were grinding\r\na knife near the house, when a rifle-shot and a shriek brought Mrs.\r\nSlocum to the door. An Indian was scalping the eldest boy, a lad of\r\nfifteen, with the knife he had been grinding.\r\n\r\n4. The savage then went into the house, and caught up a little son of\r\nMrs. Slocum. "See!" exclaimed the frightened mother, "he can do thee no\r\ngood; he is lame." The Indian released the boy, took up her little\r\ndaughter Frances, aged five years, gently in his arms, and, seizing the\r\nyounger Kingsley, hastened to the mountains.\r\n\r\n5. Two Indians who were with him, carried off a black girl, about\r\nseventeen years of age. Mr. Slocum\'s daughter caught up her brother\r\nJoseph, (my informant,) two and a half years old, and fled in safety to\r\nthe fort, where an alarm was given; but the savages were beyond\r\nsuccessful pursuit.\r\n\r\n6. About six weeks afterward, Mr. Slocum and his father-in-law Ira\r\nTripp, were shot and scalped by some Indians while foddering cattle near\r\nthe house. Again the savages escaped with their horrid trophies. Mrs.\r\nSlocum, bereft of father, husband, and child, and stripped of all\r\npossessions but the house that sheltered her, could not leave the\r\nvalley, for nine helpless children were yet in her household.\r\n\r\n7. She trusted in the God of Elijah; and, if she was not fed by the\r\nravens, she was spared by the vultures. She mourned not for the dead;\r\nfor they were at rest: but little Frances, her lost darling, where was\r\nshe? The lamp of hope kept on burning; but years rolled by, and no\r\ntidings of the little one came.\r\n\r\n8. When peace returned, and friendly intercourse with Canada was\r\nestablished, two of the little captive\'s brothers started in search of\r\nher. They traversed the wilderness to Niagara, offering rewards for her\r\nrecovery; but all in vain. They returned to Wyoming, convinced that the\r\nchild was dead. But the mother\'s heart was still the shrine of hope, and\r\nshe felt assured that Frances was not in the grave.\r\n\r\n9. Her soul appeared to commune with that of her child, and she often\r\nsaid, "I know Frances is still living." At length, the mother\'s heart\r\nwas cheered: a woman (for many years had now passed, and Frances, if\r\nliving, must have arrived to womanhood) was found among the Indians,\r\nanswering the description of the lost one. She only remembered being\r\ncarried away from the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\n10. Mrs. Slocum took her home, and cherished her with a mother\'s\r\ntenderness. Yet the mysterious link of sympathy which binds the maternal\r\nspirit to its offspring, was unfelt, and the bereaved mother was\r\nbereaved still. "It may be Frances, but it does not seem so; yet the\r\nwoman shall ever be welcome," said Mrs. Slocum. The foundling, also,\r\nfelt no filial yearnings; and, both becoming convinced that no\r\nconsanguinity existed, the orphan returned to her Indian friends.\r\n\r\n11. From time to time, the hope of the mother would be revived, and\r\njourneys were made to distant Indian settlements in search of the lost\r\nsister; but in vain. The mother went "down into the grave, mourning,"\r\nand little Frances was almost forgotten. Her brothers had become aged\r\nmen, and their grandchildren were playing upon the very spot, whence she\r\nhad been taken.\r\n\r\n12. In the summer of 1837, fifty-nine years after her capture,\r\nintelligence of Frances was received. Colonel Ewing, an Indian agent and\r\ntrader, in a letter from Logansport, Indiana, to the editor of the\r\n_Lancaster Intelligencer_, gave such information, that all doubts\r\nrespecting her identity were removed; and Joseph Slocum, with the sister\r\nwho carried him to the fort, and yet survived, immediately journeyed to\r\nOhio, where they were joined by their younger brother Isaac.\r\n\r\n13. They proceeded to Logansport, where they found Mr. Ewing, and\r\nascertained that the woman spoken of by him, lived about twelve miles\r\nfrom the village. She was immediately sent for; and, toward evening the\r\nnext day, she came into the town, riding a spirited young horse,\r\naccompanied by her two daughters, and the husband of one of them,--all\r\ndressed in full Indian costume.\r\n\r\n14. An interpreter was procured, (for she could not speak or understand\r\nEnglish,) and she listened seriously to what her brothers had to say.\r\nShe answered but little, and, at sunset, departed for her home,\r\npromising to return the next morning. The brother and sister were quite\r\nsure that it was indeed Frances, though in her face nothing but Indian\r\nlineaments were seen, her color alone revealing her origin.\r\n\r\n15. True to her appointment, she appeared the following morning,\r\naccompanied as before. Mr. Joseph Slocum then mentioned a mark of\r\nrecognition, which, his mother had said, was a sure test. While playing,\r\none day, with a hammer in a blacksmith\'s shop, Joseph, then a child two\r\nand a half years old, gave Frances a blow upon the middle finger of the\r\nleft hand, which crushed the bone, and deprived the finger of its nail.\r\n\r\n16. This test Mr. Slocum had withheld until others should fail. When he\r\nmentioned it, the aged woman was greatly agitated; and, while tears\r\nfilled the furrows of her face, she held out the wounded finger. There\r\nwas no longer a doubt, and a scene of great interest ensued. Her\r\naffections for her kindred, that had slumbered half a century, were\r\naroused, and she made earnest inquiries after her father, mother,\r\nbrothers, and sisters. Her full heart--full with the cherished secrets\r\nof her history--was opened, and the story of her life freely given.\r\n\r\n17. She said the savages, who were Delawares, after taking her to a\r\nrocky cave in the mountains, departed to the Indian country. The first\r\nnight was the unhappiest of her life. She was kindly treated,--being\r\ncarried tenderly in their arms when she was weary. She was adopted in an\r\nIndian family, and brought up as their daughter. For years she lived a\r\nroving life, and loved it. She was taught the use of the bow and arrow,\r\nand became expert in all the employments of savage existence.\r\n\r\n18. When she was grown to womanhood, both her Indian parents died, and\r\nshe soon afterward married a young chief of the nation, and removed to\r\nthe Ohio country. She was treated with more respect than the Indian\r\nwomen generally; and so happy was she in her domestic relations, that\r\nthe chance of being discovered, and compelled to return among the\r\nwhites, was the greatest evil that she feared; for she had been taught\r\nthat they were the implacable enemies of the Indians, whom she loved.\r\n\r\n19. Her husband died; and, her people having joined the Miamies, she\r\nwent with them, and married one of that tribe. The last husband was also\r\ndead, and she had been a widow many years. Children and grandchildren\r\nwere around her, and her life was passing pleasantly away. When she\r\nconcluded the narrative, she lifted her right hand in a solemn manner,\r\nand said, "All this is as true as that there is a Great Spirit in the\r\nheavens!" she had entirely forgotten her native language, and was a\r\npagan.\r\n\r\n20. On the day after the second interview, the brothers and sisters,\r\nwith the interpreter, rode out to her dwelling. It was a well-built\r\nlog-house, in the midst of cultivation. A large herd of cattle and sixty\r\nhorses were grazing in the pasture. Everything betokened plenty and\r\ncomfort; for she was wealthy, when her wants and her means were\r\ncompared. Her annuity from government, which she received as one of the\r\nMiami tribe, had been saved, and she had about one thousand dollars in\r\nspecie.\r\n\r\n21. Her white friends passed several days very agreeably with her; and\r\nsubsequently her brother Joseph, with his daughter, the wife of the Hon.\r\nMr. Bennet, of Wyoming, made her another visit, and bade her a last\r\nfarewell. She died a few years ago, and was buried with considerable\r\npomp; for she was regarded as a queen among her tribe.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. Where is the Wyoming Valley? 2.

PAULDING.\r\n\r\n1. Little more than a century ago, the beautiful region watered by this\r\nstream, was possessed by a small tribe of Indians, which has long since\r\nbecome extinct, or incorporated with some other savage nation of the\r\nWest. Three or four hundred yards from where the stream discharges\r\nitself into the Hudson, a white family, of the name of Stacy, had\r\nestablished itself in a log-house, by tacit permission of the tribe, to\r\nwhom Stacy had made himself useful by his skill in a variety of little\r\narts, highly estimated by the savages.\r\n\r\n2. In particular, a friendship subsisted between him and an old Indian,\r\ncalled Naoman, who often came to his house, and partook of his\r\nhospitality. _The Indians never forgive injuries, nor forget benefits_.\r\nThe family consisted of Stacy, his wife, and two children, a boy and a\r\ngirl, the former five, the latter three years old.\r\n\r\n3. One day, Naoman came to Stacy\'s log-hut, in his absence, lighted his\r\npipe, and sat down. He looked very serious, sometimes sighed deeply, but\r\nsaid not a word. Stacy\'s wife asked him what was the matter,--if he was\r\nsick. He shook his head, sighed, but said nothing, and soon went away.\r\nThe next day, he came again and behaved in the same manner. Stacy\'s wife\r\nbegan to think strange of this, and related it to her husband, who\r\nadvised her to urge the old man to an explanation the next time he came.\r\n\r\n4. Accordingly, when he repeated his visit the day after, she was more\r\nimportunate than usual. At last, the old Indian said. "I am a red man,\r\nand the pale faces are our enemies: why should I speak?"--"But my\r\nhusband and I are your friends: you have eaten salt with us a thousand\r\ntimes, and my children have sat on your knees as often. If you have\r\nanything on your mind, tell it me."--"It will cost me my life if it is\r\nknown, and the white-faced women are not good at keeping secrets,"\r\nreplied Naoman.\r\n\r\n5. "Try me, and see."--"Will you swear by your Great Spirit that you\r\nwill tell none but your husband?"--"I have none else to tell."--"But\r\nwill you swear?"--"I do swear by our Great Spirit, I will tell none but\r\nmy husband."--"Not if my tribe should _kill you_ for not telling?"--"Not\r\nif your tribe should kill me for not telling."\r\n\r\n6. Naoman then proceeded to tell her that, owing to some encroachments\r\nof the white people below the mountains, his tribe had become irritated,\r\nand were resolved that night to massacre all the white settlers within\r\ntheir reach; that she must send for her husband, inform him of the\r\ndanger, and, as secretly and speedily as possible, take their canoe and\r\npaddle, with all haste, over the river to Fishkill for safety. "Be\r\nquick, and do nothing that may excite suspicion," said Naoman, as he\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n7. The good wife sought her husband, who was down on the river fishing,\r\ntold him the story, and, as no time was to be lost, they proceeded to\r\ntheir boat, which was unluckily filled with water. It took some time to\r\nclear it out, and, meanwhile, Stacy recollected his gun, which had been\r\nleft behind. He proceeded to the house, and returned with it. All this\r\ntook up considerable time, and precious time it proved to this poor\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n8. The daily visits of old Naoman, and his more than ordinary gravity,\r\nhad excited suspicion in some of the tribe, who had, accordingly, paid\r\nparticular attention to the movements of Stacy. One of the young\r\nIndians, who had been kept on the watch, seeing the whole family about\r\nto take to the boat, ran to the little Indian village, about a mile off,\r\nand gave the alarm. Five Indians collected, ran down to the river, where\r\ntheir canoes were moored, jumped in, and paddled after Stacy, who, by\r\nthis time, had got some distance out into the stream.\r\n\r\n9. They gained on him so fast, that twice he dropped his paddle, and\r\ntook up his gun. But his wife prevented his shooting by telling him\r\nthat, if he fired, and they were afterwards overtaken, they would meet\r\nwith no mercy from the Indians. He accordingly refrained, and plied his\r\npaddle till the sweat rolled in big drops down his forehead. All would\r\nnot do; they were overtaken within a hundred yards from the shore, and\r\ncarried back with shouts of yelling triumph.\r\n\r\n10. When they got ashore, the Indians set fire to Stacy\'s house, and\r\ndragged himself, his wife, and children, to their village. Here the\r\nprincipal old men, and Naoman among them, assembled to deliberate on the\r\naffair. The chief men of the council stated that some of the tribe had,\r\nundoubtedly, been guilty of treason, in apprising Stacy, the white man,\r\nof the designs of the tribe, whereby they took the alarm, and well-nigh\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\n11. He proposed to examine the prisoners, to learn who gave the\r\ninformation. The old men assented to this, and Naoman among the rest.\r\nStacy was first interrogated by one of the old men, who spoke English\r\nand interpreted to the others. Stacy refused to betray his informant.\r\nHis wife was then questioned; while, at the same moment, two Indians\r\nstood threatening the two children, with tomahawks, in case she did not\r\nconfess.\r\n\r\n12. She attempted to evade the truth, by declaring she had a dream the\r\nnight before, which alarmed her, and that she had persuaded her husband\r\nto fly. "The Great Spirit never deigns to talk in dreams to a white\r\nface," said the old Indian. "Woman, thou hast two tongues, and two\r\nfaces. Speak the truth, or thy children shall surely die." The little\r\nboy and girl were then brought close to her, and the two savages stood\r\nover them, ready to execute their bloody orders.\r\n\r\n13. "Wilt thou name," said the old Indian, "the red man who betrayed his\r\ntribe? I will ask thee three times." The mother answered not. "Wilt thou\r\nname the traitor? This is the second time." The poor mother looked at\r\nher husband, and then at her children, and stole a glance at Naoman, who\r\nsat smoking his pipe with invincible gravity.\r\n\r\n14. She wrung her hands, and wept; but remained silent. "Wilt thou name\r\nthe traitor? \'Tis the third and last time." The agony of the mother\r\nwaxed more bitter; again she sought the eye of Naoman; but it was cold\r\nand motionless. A pause of a moment awaited her reply, and the tomahawks\r\nwere raised over the heads of the children, who besought their mother\r\nnot to let them be murdered.\r\n\r\n15. "Stop!" cried Naoman. All eyes were turned upon him. "Stop!"\r\nrepeated he, in a tone of authority. "White woman, thou hast kept thy\r\nword with me to the last moment. _I am the traitor_. I have eaten of the\r\nsalt, warmed myself at the fire, shared the kindness, of these Christian\r\nwhite people, and it was _I_ that told them of their danger. I am a\r\nwithered, leafless, branchless trunk. Cut me down, if you will: I am\r\nready."\r\n\r\n16. A yell of indignation sounded on all sides. Naoman descended from\r\nthe little bank where he sat, shrouded his face with his mantle of\r\nskins, and submitted to his fate. He fell dead at the feet of the white\r\nwoman by a blow of the tomahawk.\r\n\r\n17. But the sacrifice of Naoman, and the firmness of the Christian white\r\nwoman, did not suffice to save the lives of the other victims. They\r\nperished,--how, it is needless to say; and the memory of their fate has\r\nbeen preserved in the name of the pleasant stream, on whose banks they\r\nlived and died, which, to this day, is called MURDERER\'S CREEK.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

It is so called, because the first\r\n   bayonets were made at Bayonne, in France.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON\'S ARMY CROSSING THE ALPS.\r\n\r\n1. When Napoleon was carrying war into Italy, he ordered one of his\r\nofficers, Marshal Macdonald, to cross the Splugen with fifteen thousand\r\nsoldiers, and join him on the plains below. The Splugen is one of the\r\nfour great roads which cross the Alps from Switzerland to Italy.\r\n\r\n2. When Macdonald received the order, it was about the last of November,\r\nand the winter storms were raging among the mountain passes. It was a\r\nperilous undertaking, yet he must obey; and the men began their terrible\r\nmarch through narrow defiles and overhanging precipices, six thousand\r\nfeet up, up among the gloomy solitudes of the Alps.\r\n\r\n3. The cannon were placed on sleds drawn by oxen, and the ammunition was\r\npacked on mules. First came the guides, sticking their long poles in the\r\nsnow, in order to find the path; then came workmen to clear away the\r\ndrifts; then the dragoons, mounted on their most powerful horses, to\r\nbeat down the track; after which followed the main body of the army.\r\n\r\n4. They encountered severe storms and piercing cold. When half-way up\r\nthe summit, a rumbling noise was heard among the cliffs. The guides\r\nlooked at each other in alarm; for they knew well what it meant. It grew\r\nlouder and louder. "_An avalanche! an avalanche!_" they shrieked, and\r\nthe next moment a field of ice and snow came leaping down the mountain,\r\nstriking the line of march, and sweeping thirty dragoons in a wild\r\nplunge below. The black forms of the horses and their riders were seen\r\nfor an instant struggling for life, and then they disappeared forever.\r\n\r\n5. The sight struck the soldiers with horror; they crouched and shivered\r\nin the blast. Their enemy was not now flesh and blood, but wild winter\r\nstorms; swords and bayonets could not defend them from the desolating\r\navalanche. Flight or retreat was hopeless; for all around lay the\r\ndrifted snow, like a vast winding-sheet. On they must go, or death was\r\ncertain, and the brave men struggled forward.\r\n\r\n6. "Soldiers!" exclaimed their commander, "you are called to Italy; your\r\ngeneral needs you. Advance and conquer, first the mountain and the snow,\r\nthen the plains and the enemy!" Blinded by the winds, benumbed with the\r\ncold, and far beyond the reach of aid, Macdonald and his men pressed on.\r\nSometimes a whole company of soldiers were suddenly swept away by an\r\navalanche.\r\n\r\n7. On one occasion, a poor drummer, crawling out from the mass of snow,\r\nwhich had torn him from his comrades, began to beat his drum for relief.\r\nThe muffled sound came up from his gloomy resting-place, and was heard\r\nby his brother soldiers; but none could go to his rescue. For an hour,\r\nhe beat rapidly, then the strokes grew fainter, until they were heard no\r\nmore, and the poor drummer laid himself down to die. Two weeks were\r\noccupied in this perilous march, and two hundred men perished in the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n8. This passage of the Splugen is one of the bravest exploits in the\r\nhistory of Napoleon\'s generals, and illustrates the truth of the\r\nproverb, "_Where there is a will there is a way_." No one can read the\r\nheroic deeds of brave men grappling with danger and death, without a\r\nfeeling of respect and admiration; but heroic deeds are always the fruit\r\nof _toil_ and _self-sacrifice_. _No one can accomplish great things,\r\nunless he aims at great things, and pursues that aim with unflinching\r\ncourage and perseverance._\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

One of the saddest events in the history of the American Revolution\r\nis the _treason of Arnold_, and, in consequence of it, _the death of\r\nMajor Andre_. Arnold was an officer in the American army, who, though\r\nbrave, had a proud and impatient spirit.\r\n\r\n2. He fancied he had not all the honor and the pay due for his services,\r\nand, having plunged himself into debt by his expensive style of living,\r\nthese things soured his heart; and, as is the case with ungenerous\r\nminds, he never acknowledged a fault, or forgave an injury. More than\r\nthis, he sought revenge against his countrymen by plotting _treason\r\nagainst his country_.\r\n\r\n3. Soon after forming this bad design, he opened a secret correspondence\r\nwith the English General, Henry Clinton, and, at the same time, asked\r\nGeneral Washington to give him the command of West Point, an important\r\npost on the Hudson river. Washington let him have it, and this he\r\ndetermined to betray into the hands of the enemy, provided he could make\r\nout of it a good bargain for himself.\r\n\r\n4. He wrote to General Clinton what he would do, and asked to have a\r\nsecret interview with some English officer, in order to agree upon the\r\nterms. General Clinton was delighted; for he thought an army divided\r\nagainst itself, must prove an easy conquest; and he asked Major Andre, a\r\ngallant young officer, to meet Arnold, and settle the price of his\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\n5. Andre did not wish to engage in such business; but he obeyed, and\r\nwent up the Hudson in an English sloop-of-war for this purpose. Arnold\r\nagreed to meet him at a certain spot, and when night came on, sent a\r\nlittle boat to bring him ashore. He landed at the foot of a mountain\r\ncalled the Long Clove, on the western side of the river, a few miles\r\nfrom Haverstraw, where he found the traitor hid in a clump of bushes.\r\n\r\n6. Little did poor Andre foresee the fatal consequences of this step.\r\nAll that still star-light night they sat and talked; daylight came, and\r\nthe business was not concluded. Arnold dismissed the boatmen, and led\r\nhis companion to a solitary farm-house on the river\'s bank, where the\r\npapers were finally drawn up, and hid in one of Andre\'s stockings. Andre\r\nfelt how exposed he was to danger in the enemy\'s country, and heartily\r\nwished himself back to the sloop.\r\n\r\n7. Forced now, however, to go by land, Arnold gave him a pass to go\r\nthrough the American lines; and, at sunset, he set off, on horseback,\r\nwith a guide. They crossed the river, and, getting along on their\r\ndangerous journey with but few alarms, the guide left the next morning,\r\nand Andre rode briskly on, congratulating himself upon leaving all\r\ndangers behind, for he was rapidly nearing the English lines, when there\r\nwas a loud shout, "_Stand!_ HALT!" and three men [Footnote: Paulding,\r\nWilliams, and Van Wart.] issued from the woods, one seizing the bridle,\r\nand the others presenting their guns.\r\n\r\n8. Andre told them he had a pass to White Plains, on urgent business\r\nfrom General Arnold, and begged them not to detain him; but the men,\r\nsuspecting that all was not right, began to search him; and, hauling off\r\nhis boots, they discovered his papers in his stockings.\r\n\r\n9. Finding himself detected, he offered them any sum of money, if they\r\nwould let him go. "No;" answered the sturdy men, "not if you would give\r\nus ten thousand guineas;" for, though poor, they were above selling\r\ntheir country at any price. Andre was sent a prisoner to General\r\nWashington\'s camp. Arnold, on learning the news of his capture,\r\nimmediately fled from West Point, and made his escape to the English\r\nsloop.\r\n\r\n10. According to the rules of war, poor Andre was sentenced to the death\r\nof a spy. Great efforts were made to save him. General Clinton offered a\r\nlarge sum to redeem him. So young, so amiable, so gallant, and to meet a\r\nfelon\'s doom! but, in ten days he was hung.\r\n\r\n11. Arnold lived; but, with the thirty thousand dollars--the price of\r\nhis treachery--he lived a miserable man, despised even by those who\r\nbought him. And one impressive lesson which the story teaches, is, that\r\n_the consequences of guilt do not fall alone on the guilty man;_ others\r\nare often involved in distress, disgrace, and ruin.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

Pursued by\r\nthe blood-hounds of the Reign of Terror, stripped of every wreck of\r\nproperty or power, Talleyrand secured a passage to America, in a ship\r\nabout to sail. He was a beggar and a wanderer in a strange land, to earn\r\nhis bread by daily labor.\r\n\r\n2. "Is there an American staying at your house?" he asked the landlord\r\nof the hotel. "I am bound to cross the water, and should like a letter\r\nto a person of influence in the New World." The landlord hesitated a\r\nmoment, then replied: "There is a gentleman up-stairs, either from\r\nAmerica or Britain; but whether an American or an Englishman, I can not\r\ntell."\r\n\r\n3. He pointed the way, and Talleyrand, who, in his life, was Bishop,\r\nPrince, and Prime Minister, ascended the stairs. A miserable suppliant,\r\nhe stood before the stranger\'s door, knocked, and entered. In the far\r\ncorner of the dimly-lighted room, sat a man of some fifty years, his\r\narms folded, and his head bowed on his breast. From a window directly\r\nopposite, a faint light rested on his forehead.\r\n\r\n4. His eyes looked from beneath the downcast brows, and gazed on\r\nTalleyrand\'s face with a peculiar and searching expression. His face was\r\nstriking in outline,--the mouth and chin indicative of an iron will. His\r\nform, vigorous, even with the snows of fifty winters, was clad in a\r\ndark, but rich and distinguished costume.\r\n\r\n5. Talleyrand advanced, stated that he was a fugitive; and, under the\r\nimpression that the gentleman before him was an American, he solicited\r\nhis kind and generous offices. He related his history in eloquent French\r\nand broken English.\r\n\r\n6. "I am a wanderer, and an exile. I am forced to flee to the New World,\r\nwithout a friend or home. You are an American! Give me, then, I beseech\r\nyou, a letter of yours, so that I may be able to earn my bread. I am\r\nwilling to toil in any manner; the scenes of Paris have seized me with\r\nsuch horror, that a life of labor would be a paradise to a career of\r\nluxury in France. You will give me a letter to one of your friends? A\r\ngentleman like yourself has, doubtless, many friends."\r\n\r\n7. The strange gentleman rose. With a look that Talleyrand never forgot,\r\nhe retreated to the door of the next chamber,--his eyes looking still\r\nfrom beneath his darkened brow. He spoke as he retreated backward,--his\r\nvoice was full of meaning. "I am the only man born in the New World, who\r\ncan raise his hand to God and say, I have not a friend, not one, in all\r\nAmerica!" Talleyrand never forgot the overwhelming sadness of that look\r\nwhich accompanied these words.\r\n\r\n8. "Who are you?" he cried, as the strange man retreated to the next\r\nroom: "your name?" "My name," he replied, with a smile that had more of\r\nmockery than joy in its convulsive expression,--"my name is Benedict\r\nArnold!" He was gone: Talleyrand sank into his chair, gasping the words,\r\n"ARNOLD, THE TRAITOR!"\r\n\r\n9. Thus, you see, he wandered over the earth another Cain, with the\r\nwanderer\'s mark upon his brow. Even in that secluded room, in that inn\r\nat Havre, his crimes found him out, and forced him to tell his name:\r\nthat name the synonym of infamy. The last twenty years of his life are\r\ncovered with a cloud, from whose darkness but a few gleams of light\r\nflash out upon the page of history.\r\n\r\n10. The manner of his death is not exactly known; but we can not doubt\r\nthat he died utterly friendless,--that remorse pursued him to the grave,\r\nwhispering "John Andre" in his ear,--and that the memory of his course\r\nof infamy gnawed like a canker at his heart, murmuring forever, "True to\r\nyour country, what might you have been, O ARNOLD, THE TRAITOR!"\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

A railroad train was rushing along at almost lightning speed. A curve\r\nwas just ahead, beyond which was a station, at which the cars usually\r\npassed each other. The conductor was late,--so late that the period\r\nduring which the down train was to wait, had nearly elapsed: but he\r\nhoped yet to pass the curve safely. Suddenly, a locomotive dashed into\r\nsight right ahead. In an instant, there was a collision. A shriek, a\r\nshock, and fifty souls were in eternity; and all because an engineer had\r\nbeen _behind time_.\r\n\r\n2. A great battle was going on. Column after column had been\r\nprecipitated for eight mortal hours on the enemy posted along the ridge\r\nof a hill. The summer sun was sinking to the west; re-enforcements for\r\nthe obstinate defenders were already in sight; it was necessary to carry\r\nthe position with one final charge, or every thing would be lost. A\r\npowerful corps had been summoned from across the country, and, if it\r\ncame up in season, all would yet be right. The great conqueror,\r\nconfident in its arrival, formed his reserve into an attacking column,\r\nand led them down the hill. The whole world knows the result. Grouchy\r\n[Footnote: Pronounced _Groo\' shee_.] failed to appear; the imperial\r\nguard was beaten back; Waterloo was lost. Napoleon died a prisoner at\r\nSt. Helena, because one of his marshals was _behind time_.\r\n\r\n3. A leading firm, in commercial circles had long struggled against\r\nbankruptcy. As it had enormous assets in California, it expected\r\nremittances by a certain day; and if the sums promised arrived, its\r\ncredit, its honor, and its future prosperity would be preserved. But\r\nweek after week elapsed without bringing the gold. At last, came the\r\nfatal day on which the firm had bills maturing to enormous amounts. The\r\nsteamer was telegraphed at daybreak; but it was found on inquiry that\r\nshe brought no funds; and the house failed. The next arrival brought\r\nnearly half a million to the insolvents, but it was too late; they were\r\nruined, because their agent, in remitting, had been _behind time_.\r\n\r\n4. A condemned man was led out for execution, he had taken human life,\r\nbut under circumstances of the greatest provocation, and public sympathy\r\nwas active in his behalf. Thousands had signed petitions for a reprieve,\r\na favorable answer had been expected the night before, and, though it\r\nhad not come, even the sheriff felt confident that it would yet arrive\r\nin season. Thus the morning passed without the appearance of the\r\nmessenger. The last moment was up. The prisoner took his place on the\r\ndrop, the cap was drawn over his eyes, the bolt was drawn, and a\r\nlifeless body hung suspended in the air. Just at that moment a horseman\r\ncame into sight, galloping down the hill, his steed covered with foam.\r\nHe carried a packet in his right hand, which he waved to the crowd. He\r\nwas the express rider with the reprieve. But he had come too late. A\r\ncomparatively innocent man had died an ignominious death, because a\r\nwatch had been five minutes too slow, making its bearer arrive _behind\r\ntime_.\r\n\r\n5. It is continually so in life. The best laid plans, the most important\r\naffairs, the fortunes of individuals, the wealth of nations, honor,\r\nhappiness, life itself, are daily sacrificed because somebody is "behind\r\ntime." There are men who always fail in whatever they undertake, simply\r\nbecause they are "behind time." Five minutes in a crisis are worth\r\nyears. It is but a little period, yet it has often saved a fortune, or\r\nredeemed a people. If there is one virtue that should be cultivated more\r\nthan another by him who would succeed in life, it is _punctuality_; if\r\nthere is one error that should be avoided, it is being _behind time_.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. What sad results are mentioned, in consequence of being\r\n_behind time?_ 2. What virtue should be cultivated, and what error\r\navoided? 3.

A little girl sat amid the flowers,\r\n   In the blush and bloom of childhood\'s hours;\r\n   She twined the buds in a garland fair,\r\n   And bound them up in her shining hair:\r\n   "Ah, me!" said she, "_how happy I\'ll be_,\r\n   When ten years more have gone over me,\r\n   And I am a maiden with youth\'s bright glow\r\n   Flushing my cheek, and lighting my brow!"\r\n\r\n2. A maiden mused in a pleasant room,\r\n   Where the air was filled with a soft perfume;\r\n   Vases were near of antique mold,\r\n   And beautiful pictures, rare and old;\r\n   And she, amid all the beauty there,\r\n   Was by far the loveliest and most fair.\r\n   "Ah, me!" said she, "_how happy I\'ll be_,\r\n   When my heart\'s own choice comes back to me,\r\n   When I proudly stand by my dear one\'s side,\r\n   With the thrilling joy of a youthful bride!"\r\n\r\n3. A mother bent o\'er the cradle nest\r\n   Where she soothed her babe to his smiling rest;\r\n   She watched the sleep of her cherub-boy,\r\n   And her spirit throbbed with exulting joy.\r\n   "Ah, me!" said she, "_how happy I\'ll be_,\r\n   When he reaches manhood, proud and free,\r\n   And the world bows down, in its rapture wild,\r\n   It the earnest words of my darling child!"\r\n\r\n4. An aged one sat by the cozy hearth,\r\n   Counting life\'s sands as they ebbed from earth;\r\n   Feeble and frail; the race she run\r\n   Had borne her along to the setting sun.\r\n   "Ah, me!" said she, "_how happy I\'ll be_,\r\n   When from time\'s long fever my soul is free,\r\n   When the world fades out with its weary strife,\r\n   And I soar away to a better life!"\r\n\r\n5. \'Tis thus we journey from youth to age,\r\n   Longing to turn to another page,\r\n   Striving to hasten the years away,\r\n   Lighting our hearts with the future\'s ray,\r\n   Hoping on earth till its visions fade,\r\n   Wishing and waiting, through sun and shade,\r\n   But turning, when earth\'s last tie is riven,\r\n   To the beautiful rest of a fadeless Heaven.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

His eye was growing dim,\r\n   When, with a feeble voice, he called\r\n     His weeping son to him:\r\n   "Weep not, my boy," the veteran said,\r\n     "I bow to Heaven\'s high will;\r\n   But quickly from yon antlers bring,\r\n     The sword of Bunker Hill."\r\n\r\n2. The sword was brought; the soldier\'s eye\r\n     Lit with a sudden flame;\r\n   And, as he grasped the ancient blade,\r\n     He murmured Warren\'s[1] name;\r\n   Then said, "My boy, I leave you gold,\r\n     But what is richer still,\r\n   I leave you, mark me, mark me, now,\r\n     The sword of Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\n3.

"Oh! keep this sword," his accents broke,--\r\n     A smile--and he was dead;\r\n   But his wrinkled hand still grasped the blade,\r\n     Upon that dying bed.\r\n   The son remains, the sword remains,\r\n     Its glory growing still,\r\n   And twenty millions bless the sire\r\n     And sword of Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: General Warren, a brave and valuable officer, fell by a\r\nmusket-ball, while fighting the British at Bunker\'s Hill, June 17th,\r\n1775.]\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

It was here in the wilds of the Wis sa hi\' kon, on the day of battle,\r\nas the noonday sun came shining through the thickly clustered leaves,\r\nthat two men met in mortal combat. They grappled in deadly conflict near\r\na rock that rose, like the huge wreck of some primeval world, at least\r\none hundred feet above the dark waters of the Wis sa hi\'kon.\r\n\r\n2. That man with the dark brow and the darker gray eye,--with the\r\nmuscular form, clad in the blue hunting-frock of the Revolution,--is a\r\nContinental, named Warner. His brother was murdered at the massacre of\r\nPao\'li. That _other_ man, with long black hair drooping along his\r\ncadaverous face, is clad in the half-military costume of a Tory refugee.\r\n_That_ is the murderer of Pao\'li, named Dabney.\r\n\r\n3. They had met there in the woods by accident; and now they fought, not\r\nwith sword or rifle, but with long and deadly hunting-knives, that flash\r\nin the light as they go turning, and twining, and twisting over the\r\ngreen-sward. At last, the Tory is down!--down on the green-sward, with\r\nthe knee of the Continental upon his breast,--that up-raised knife\r\nquivering in the light,--that dark-gray eye flashing death into his\r\nface!\r\n\r\n4. "Quarter! I yield!" gasped the Tory, as the knee was pressed upon his\r\nbreast. "Spare me!--I yield!"\r\n\r\n5. "_My_ brother," said the patriot soldier, in a low tone of deadly\r\nhate,--"_My_ brother cried for quarter on the night of Pa o\' li, and,\r\neven as he clung to your knees, you struck that knife into his heart.\r\nOh, I will give you the quarter of Pa o\' li!" And his hand was raised\r\nfor the blow, and his teeth were clinched in deadly hate. He paused for\r\na moment, and then pinioned the Tory\'s arms, and, with one rapid stride,\r\ndragged him to the verge of the rock, and held him quivering over the\r\nabyss.\r\n\r\n6. "Mercy!" gasped the Tory, turning black and ashy by turns, as that\r\nawful gulf yawned below. "_Mercy! I have a wife! a child! spare me!_"\r\n\r\n7. Then the Continental, with his muscular strength gathered for the\r\neffort, shook the murderer once more over the abyss, and then hissed\r\nthis bitter sneer between his teeth,--"_My brother had a wife and two\r\nchildren_. The morning after the night of Pa o\' li, that wife was a\r\nwidow,--those children were orphans! Would not you like to go and beg\r\nyour life of that widow and her children?"\r\n\r\n8. The proposal, made by the Continental in the mere mockery of hate,\r\nwas taken in serious earnest by the horror-stricken Tory. He begged to\r\nbe taken to the widow and her children, to have the pitiful privilege of\r\nbegging his life. After a moment\'s serious thought, the patriot soldier\r\nconsented. He bound the Tory\'s arms yet tighter, placed him on the rock\r\nagain, and then led him up the woods. A quiet cottage, imbosomed among\r\nthe trees, broke on their eyes.\r\n\r\n9. They entered that cottage. There, beside the desolate hearth-stone,\r\nsat the widow and her children. She was a matronly woman of about thirty\r\nyears, with a face faded by care, a deep, dark eye, and long, disheveled\r\nhair about her shoulder. On one side was a dark-haired boy, of some six\r\nyears; on the other, a little girl, one year younger, with light hair\r\nand blue eyes. The Bible, an old, venerable volume, lay open on that\r\nmother\'s lap.\r\n\r\n10. And then that pale-faced Tory flung himself on his knees, confessed\r\nthat he had butchered her husband on the night of Pa o\'li, but begged\r\nhis life at her hands! _"Spare me, for the sake of my wife--my child!"_\r\nHe had expected that his pitiful moan would touch the widow\'s heart; but\r\nnot one relenting gleam softened her pale face.\r\n\r\n11. "The Lord shall judge between us!" she said in a cold, icy tone,\r\nthat froze the murderer\'s heart. "Look! The Bible lies open before me. I\r\nwill close that volume, and then this boy shall open it, and place his\r\nfinger at random upon a line, and by _that line_ you shall live or die!"\r\nThis was a strange proposal, made in full faith of a wild and dark\r\nsuperstition of the olden time. For a moment, the Tory, kneeling there,\r\nlivid as ashes, was wrapt in thought. Then, in a faltering voice, he\r\nsignified his consent.\r\n\r\n12. Raising her dark eyes to heaven, the mother prayed the Great Father\r\nto direct the finger of her son. She closed the book, and handed it to\r\nthat boy, whose young cheek reddened with loathing as he gazed upon his\r\nfather\'s murderer. He took the Bible, opened its holy pages at random,\r\nand placed his fingers upon a verse.\r\n\r\n13. Then there was a silence. That Continental soldier, who had sworn to\r\navenge his brother\'s death, stood there with dilating eyes and parted\r\nlips. Then the culprit, kneeling on the floor, with a face like\r\ndiscolored clay, felt his heart leap to his throat. Then, in a clear,\r\nbold voice, the widow read this line from the Old Testament. It was\r\nshort, yet terrible: "_That man shall die!_"\r\n\r\n14. Look! The brother springs forward to plunge a knife into the\r\nmurderer\'s heart; but the Tory, pinioned as he is, begs that one more\r\ntrial may be made by the little girl,--that child of five years, with\r\ngolden hair and laughing eyes. The widow consents. There is an awful\r\npause. With a smile in her eye, without knowing what she does, the\r\nlittle girl opens the Bible,--she turns her laughing face away,--she\r\nplaces her fingers upon the page.\r\n\r\n15. That awful silence grows deeper. The deep-drawn breath of the\r\nbrother, and the broken gasps of the murderer, alone disturb the\r\nstillness. The widow and dark-eyed boy are breathless. That little girl,\r\nunconscious as she was, caught a feeling of awe from the countenances\r\naround her, and stood breathless, her face turned aside, and her tiny\r\nfingers resting on that line of life or death. At last, gathering\r\ncourage, the widow bent her eyes on the page, and read. It was a line\r\nfrom the New Testament: "LOVE YOUR ENEMIES." Ah! that moment was\r\nsublime!\r\n\r\n16. Oh, awful Book of God! in whose dread pages we see Job talking face\r\nto face with Jehovah, or Jesus waiting by Samaria\'s well, or wandering\r\nby the waves of dark Galilee! Oh, awful Book! shining to-night, as I\r\nspeak, the light of that widow\'s home,--the glory of the mechanic\'s\r\nshop,--shining where the world comes not, to look on the last night of\r\nthe convict in his cell, lightening the way to God, even over that dread\r\ngibbet!\r\n\r\n17. Oh, Book of terrible majesty and child-like love,--for sublimity\r\nthat crushes the soul into awe,--of beauty that melts the heart with\r\nrapture! you never shone more strangely beautiful than there in the\r\nlonely cot of the Wissa hi\'kon, where you saved the murderer\'s life.\r\nFor,--need I tell you?--_that murderer\'s life was saved_. That widow\r\nrecognized the finger of God, and even the stern brother was awed into\r\nsilence. The murderer went his way.\r\n\r\n18. Now look ye, how wonderful are the ways of Heaven! That very night,\r\nas the widow sat by her lonely hearth, her orphans by her side,--sat\r\nthere with a crushed heart and hot eye-balls, thinking of her husband,\r\nwho, she supposed, now lay moldering on the blood-drenched soil of Pa o\'\r\nli,--there was a tap at the door. She opened it, and that husband,\r\nliving, though covered with wounds, was in her arms! He had fallen at Pa\r\no\' li, but not in death. _He was alive_,--his wife lay panting on his\r\nbreast. That night there was a prayer in that wood-embowered cot of the\r\nWis sa hi\' kon.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. What two men are said to have engaged in deadly combat?\r\n2. Which gained the mastery? 3.

Start not forward in life with the idea of\r\nbecoming mere seekers of pleasure,--sportive butterflies searching for\r\ngaudy flowers. Consider and act with reference to the true ends of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n2. This world is but the vestibule of an immortal life. Every action of\r\nyour life touches on some chord that will vibrate in eternity. These\r\nthoughts and motives within you, stir the pulses of a deathless spirit.\r\nAct not, then, as mere creatures of this life, who, for a little while,\r\nare to walk the valleys and the hills, to enjoy the sunshine and to\r\nbreathe the air, and then pass away and be no more; but _act_ as\r\nimmortals, with an _aim_ and a _purpose_ worthy of your high nature.\r\n\r\n3. Set before you, as the chief object to be obtained, an _end_ that is\r\nsuperior to any on earth,--_a desirable end_, A PERFECT END. Labor to\r\naccomplish a work which shall survive unchanged and beautiful, when time\r\nshall have withered the garland of youth, when thrones of power and\r\nmonuments of art shall have crumbled into ashes; and, finally, aim to\r\nachieve something, which, when these our mutable and perishing voices\r\nare hushed forever, shall live amid the songs and triumphs of\r\nIMMORTALITY.\r\n\r\n4. Well will it be for you, if you have a _guide_ within, which will aid\r\nyou in every issue which will arm you in every temptation, and comfort\r\nyou in every sorrow. Consult, then, that Volume whose precepts will\r\nnever fail you. Consult it with a deep aspiration after the true and\r\ngood, and it shall illuminate your understanding with divine realities.\r\n\r\n5. Open your soul, and it shall breathe into it a holy influence, and\r\nfill all its wants. Bind it close to your heart; it will be a shield\r\nagainst all the assaults of evil. Read it in the lonely hour of\r\ndesertion; it will be the best of companions. Open it when the voyage of\r\nlife is troubled\'; it is a sure chart.

It was a calm, sunny day in the year 1750; the scene, a piece of\r\nforest land in the north of Virginia, near a noble stream of water.\r\nImplements of surveying were lying about, and several men reclining\r\nunder the trees, betokened, by their dress and appearance, that they\r\ncomposed a party engaged in laying out the wild lands of the country.\r\n\r\n2. These persons had apparently just finished their dinner. Apart from\r\nthe group, walked a young man of a tall and compact frame, and moved\r\nwith the elastic tread of one accustomed to constant exercise in the\r\nopen air. His countenance wore a look of decision and manliness not\r\nusually found in one so young, for he was apparently little over\r\neighteen years of age. His hat had been cast off, as if for comfort, and\r\nhe had paused, with one foot advanced, in a graceful and natural\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n3. Suddenly there was a shriek, then another, and several in rapid\r\nsuccession. The voice was that of a woman, and seemed to proceed from\r\nthe other side of a dense thicket. At the first scream, the youth turned\r\nhis head in the direction of the sound; but when it was repeated, he\r\npushed aside the undergrowth which separated him from it, and,\r\nquickening his footsteps, as the cries succeeded each other in alarming\r\nrapidity, he soon dashed into an open space on the banks of the stream,\r\nwhere stood a rude log-cabin.\r\n\r\n4. As the young man broke from the undergrowth, he saw his companions\r\ncrowded together on the banks of the river, while in the midst stood the\r\nwoman, from whom proceeded the shrieks, held back by two of the men, but\r\nstruggling vigorously for freedom. It was but the work of a moment for\r\nthe young man to make his way through the crowd and confront the female.\r\nThe instant her eye fell on him, she exclaimed, "Oh! sir, you will do\r\nsomething for me. Make them release me,--for the love of God! _My\r\nboy,--my poor boy is drowning, and they will not let me go!"_ "It would\r\nbe madness; she will jump into the river," said one, "and the rapids\r\nwould dash her to pieces in a moment!"\r\n\r\n5. The youth had scarcely waited for these words, for he recollected the\r\nchild, a bold little boy of four years old, whose beautiful blue eyes\r\nand flaxen ringlets made him a favorite with all who knew him. He had\r\nbeen accustomed to play in the little inclosure before the cabin, but\r\nthe gate having been left open, he had stolen incautiously out, reached\r\nthe edge of the bank, and was in the act of looking over, when his\r\nmother saw him.\r\n\r\n6. The shriek she uttered only hastened the catastrophe she feared; for\r\nthe child, frightened at the cry of its mother, lost its balance, and\r\nfell into the stream, which here went foaming and roaring along amid\r\ninnumerable rocks, constituting the most dangerous rapids known in that\r\nsection of the country. Scream now followed scream in rapid succession,\r\nas the agonized mother rushed to the bank.\r\n\r\n7. The party we left reclining in the shade within a few steps of the\r\naccident, were immediately on the spot. Fortunate it was that they were\r\nso near, else the mother would have jumped in after her child, and both\r\nbeen lost. Several of the men approached the brink, and were on the\r\npoint of springing in after the child, when the sight of the sharp rocks\r\ncrowding the channel, the rush and whirl of the waters, and the want of\r\nany knowledge where to look for the boy, deterred them, and they gave up\r\nthe enterprise.\r\n\r\n8. Not so with the noble youth. His first work was to throw off his\r\ncoat; next to spring to the edge of the bank. Here he stood for a\r\nmoment, running his eyes rapidly over the scene below, taking with a\r\nglance the different currents and the most dangerous of the rocks, in\r\norder to shape his course when in the stream. He had scarcely formed his\r\nconclusion, when he saw in the water a white object, which he knew to be\r\nthe boy\'s dress, and he plunged into the wild and roaring rapids.\r\n\r\n9. _"Thank God, he will save my child,"_ cried the mother; _"there he\r\nis!--oh! my boy, my darling boy, how could I leave you!"_ Every one had\r\nrushed to the brink of the precipice, and was now following with eager\r\neyes the progress of the youth, as the current bore him onward, like a\r\nfeather in the embrace of the hurricane. Now it seemed as if he would be\r\ndashed against a jutting rock, over which the water flew in foam, and a\r\nwhirlpool would drag him in, from whose grasp escape would appear\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n10. At times, the current bore him under, and he would be lost to sight;\r\nthen, just as the spectators gave him up, he would appear, though far\r\nfrom where he vanished, still buffeting amid the vortex. Oh, how that\r\nmother\'s straining eyes followed him in his perilous career! how her\r\nheart sunk when he went under,--and with what a gush of joy when she saw\r\nhim emerge again from the waters, and, flinging the waves aside with his\r\nathletic arms, struggle on in pursuit of her boy!\r\n\r\n11. But it seemed as if his generous efforts were not to avail; for,\r\nthough the current was bearing off the boy before his eyes, scarcely ten\r\nfeet distant, he could not, despite his gigantic efforts, overtake the\r\ndrowning child. On flew the youth and child; and it was miraculous how\r\neach escaped being dashed in pieces against the rocks. Twice the boy\r\nwent out of sight, and a suppressed shriek escaped the mother\'s lips;\r\nbut twice he reappeared, and then, with hands wrung wildly together, and\r\nbreathless anxiety, she followed his progress, as his unresisting form\r\nwas hurried with the onward current.\r\n\r\n12. The youth now appeared to redouble his exertions, for they were\r\napproaching the most dangerous part of the river, where the rapids,\r\ncontracting between the narrow shores, shot almost perpendicularly down\r\na declivity of fifteen feet. The rush of the waters at this spot was\r\ntremendous, and no one ventured to approach its vicinity, even in a\r\ncanoe, lest he should be dashed in pieces. What, then, would be the\r\nyouth\'s fate, unless he soon overtook the child? He seemed fully\r\nsensible of the increasing peril, and now urged his way through the\r\nfoaming current with a desperate strength.\r\n\r\n13. Three times he was on the point of grasping the child, when the\r\nwaters whirled the prize from him. The third effort was made just as\r\nthey were entering within the influence of the current above the fall;\r\nand when it failed, the mother\'s heart sunk within her, and she groaned,\r\nfully expecting the youth to give up his task. But no; he only pressed\r\nforward the more eagerly; and, as they breathlessly watched amid the\r\nboiling waters, they saw the form of the brave youth following close\r\nafter that of the boy.\r\n\r\n14. And now, like an arrow from the bow, pursuer and pursued shot to the\r\nbrink of the precipice. An instant they hung there, distinctly visible\r\namid the foaming waters. Every brain grew dizzy at the sight. But a\r\nshout of involuntary exultation burst from the spectators, when they saw\r\nthe boy held aloft by the right arm of the youth,--a shout that was\r\nsuddenly checked with horror, when they both vanished into the abyss\r\nbelow!\r\n\r\n15. A moment elapsed before a word was spoken, or a breath drawn. The\r\nmother ran forward, and then stood gazing with fixed eyes at the foot of\r\nthe cataract, as if her all depended upon what the next moment should\r\nreveal. Suddenly she gave the glad cry, (_f_.) "_There they are! See!\r\nthey are safe!_--Great God, I thank thee!" And, sure enough, there was\r\nthe youth still unharmed, and still buffeting the waters. He had just\r\nemerged from the boiling vortex below the cataract. With one hand he\r\nheld aloft the child, and with the other he was making for the shore.\r\n\r\n16. They ran, they shouted, they scarcely knew what they did, until they\r\nreached his side, just as he was struggling to the bank. They drew him\r\nout almost exhausted. The boy was senseless; but his mother declared\r\nthat he still lived, as she pressed him frantically to her bosom. The\r\nyouth could scarcely stand, so faint was he from his exertions.\r\n\r\n17. Who can describe the scene that followed,--the mother\'s calmness\r\nwhile she strove to resuscitate her boy, and her wild gratitude to his\r\npreserver, when the child was out of danger, and sweetly sleeping in her\r\narms? Our pen shrinks at the task. But her words, pronounced then, were\r\nremembered afterwards by more than one who heard them.\r\n\r\n18. "_God will reward you_," said she, "as _I_ can not. He will do great\r\nthings for you in return for this day\'s work, and the blessings of\r\nthousands besides mine will attend you." And so it was; for, to the\r\n_hero_ of that hour, were subsequently confided the destinies of a\r\nmighty nation. But, throughout his long career, what tended to make him\r\nmore honored and respected beyond all men, was the _self-sacrificing\r\nspirit_, which, in the rescue of that mother\'s child, as in the more\r\naugust events of his life, characterized OUR BELOVED WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

SANE.\r\n\r\n 1. A pious Rabbi, forced by heathen hate,\r\n      To quit the boundaries of his native land,\r\n    Wandered abroad, submissive to his fate,\r\n      Through pathless woods and wastes of burning sand.\r\n\r\n 2. A patient ass, to bear him in his flight,\r\n      A dog, to guard him from the robber\'s stealth,\r\n    A lamp, by which to read the law at night,--\r\n      Was all the pilgrim\'s store of worldly wealth.\r\n\r\n 3. At set of sun he reached a little town,\r\n      And asked for shelter and a crumb of food;\r\n    But every face repelled him with a frown,\r\n      And so he sought a lodging in the wood.\r\n\r\n 4. "\'Tis very hard," the weary traveler said,\r\n      "And most inhospitable, I protest,\r\n    To send me fasting to this forest bed;\r\n      But God is good, and means it for the best!"\r\n\r\n 5. He lit his lamp to read the sacred law,\r\n      Before he spread his mantle for the night;\r\n    But the wind rising with a sudden flaw,\r\n      He read no more,--the gust put out the light.\r\n\r\n 6. "\'Tis strange," he said, "\'tis very strange, indeed,\r\n      That ere I lay me down to take my rest,\r\n    A chapter of the law I may not read,--\r\n      But God is good, and all is for the best!"\r\n\r\n 7. With these consoling words the Rabbi tries\r\n      To sleep,--his head reposing on a log,--\r\n    But, ere he fairly shut his drowsy eyes,\r\n      A wolf came up and killed his faithful dog.\r\n\r\n 8. "What new calamity is this?" he cried;\r\n      "My honest dog--a friend who stood the test\r\n    When others failed--lies murdered at my side!\r\n      Well,--God is good, and means it for the best."\r\n\r\n 9. Scarce had the Rabbi spoken, when, alas!--\r\n      As if, at once, to crown his wretched lot,\r\n    A hungry lion pounced upon the ass,\r\n      And killed the faithful donkey on the spot.\r\n\r\n10. "Alas!--alas!" the weeping Rabbi said,\r\n      "Misfortune haunts me like a hateful guest;\r\n    My dog is gone, and now my ass is dead,--\r\n      Well, God is good, and all is for the best!"\r\n\r\n11. At dawn of day, imploring heavenly grace,\r\n      Once more he sought the town, but all in vain;\r\n    A band of robbers had despoiled the place,\r\n      And all the churlish citizens were slain.\r\n\r\n12. "Now God be praised!" the grateful Rabbi cried,\r\n      "If I had tarried in the town to rest,\r\n    I too, with these poor villagers had died,--\r\n      Sure, God is good, and all is for the best!"\r\n\r\n13. "Had not the saucy wind put out my lamp,\r\n      By which the sacred law I would have read,\r\n    The light had shown the robbers to my camp,\r\n      And here the villains would have left me dead.\r\n\r\n14. "Had not my faithful animals been slain,\r\n      Their noise, no doubt, had drawn the robbers near,\r\n    And so their master, it is very plain,\r\n      Instead of them, had fallen murdered here.\r\n\r\n15. "Full well I see that this hath happened so\r\n      To put my faith and patience to the test;\r\n    Thanks to His name! for now I surely know\r\n      That God is good, and all is for the best!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLESSON LXVI.\r\n\r\n   FU TU\' RI TY, events to come.\r\n   CON SULT\', counsel with.\r\n   PRE TEN\' SIONS, claims; assumptions.\r\n   FOR\' TI TUDE, patience; endurance.\r\n   MOD\' EL, pattern; example.\r\n   RES IG NA\' TION, submissiveness.\r\n   O VER WHELMS\', overcomes.\r\n   IN GRAT\' I TUDE, unthankfulness.\r\n   VAG\' A BOND, vagrant; worthless.\r\n   IM\' PU DENCE, sauciness.\r\n   DES\' TI NY, fate; final lot.\r\n   DE CEAS\' ED, dead.\r\n   DE PRIV\' ED, robbed.\r\n   IN CUR\' RED, brought on; caused.\r\n   CON SUL TA\' TIONS, couselings.\r\n   CAL CU LA\' TIONS, reckonings.\r\n   PRE TER NAT\' U RAL, (PRETER, _beyond_;) beyond what is natural;\r\n   miraculous.\r\n   IN VOLV\' ED, (IN, _in_; VOLVED, _rolled_;) rolled in; enveloped.\r\n   IN TER RUPT\', (INTER, _in, between_; RUPT, _to break_;) break in\r\n   between; stop; hinder.\r\n\r\n[Headnote 1: JOB, a patriarch, celebrated for his patience, constancy,\r\nand piety.

CREDULOUS AND THE FORTUNE-TELLER.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Credulous._ Are you the fortune-teller, sir, that knows every\r\nthing?\r\n\r\n_Fortune-Teller._ I sometimes consult futurity, madam; but I make no\r\npretensions to any supernatural knowledge.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Ay, so _you_ say; but every body else says you know _every\r\nthing_; and I have come all the way from Boston to consult you; for you\r\nmust know I have met with a dreadful loss.\r\n\r\n_F. T._ We are liable to losses in this world, madam.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Yes; and I have had my share of them, though I shall be only\r\nfifty, come Thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n_F. T._ You must have learned to bear misfortunes with fortitude, by\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ I don\'t know how that is, though my dear husband, rest his\r\nsoul, used to say, "Molly, you are as patient as Job,[Headnote 1] though\r\nyou never had any children to lose, as he had."\r\n\r\n_F. T._ Job was a model of patience, madam, and few could lose their all\r\nwith so much resignation.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Ah, sir\', that is too true\'; for even the small loss _I_ have\r\nsuffered, overwhelms me!\r\n\r\n_F. T._ The loss of property, madam, comes home to the bosom of the best\r\nof us.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Yes, sir; and when the thing lost can not be replaced, it is\r\ndoubly distressing. When my poor, good man, on our wedding day, gave me\r\nthe ring, "Keep it, Molly," said he, "till you die, for my sake." And\r\nnow, that I should have lost it, after keeping it thirty years, and\r\nlocking it up so carefully all the time, as I did--\r\n\r\n_F. T._ We can not be too careful in this world, madam; our best friends\r\noften deceive us.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ True, sir, true,--but who would have thought that the child I\r\ntook, as it were, out of the street, and brought up as my own, could\r\nhave been guilty of such ingratitude? She never would have touched what\r\nwas not her own, if her vagabond lover had not put her up to it.\r\n\r\n_F. T._ Ah, madam, ingratitude is the basest of all crimes!\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Yes; but to think that the impudent creature should deny she\r\ntook it, when I saw it in the possession of that wretch myself.\r\n\r\n_F. T._ Impudence, madam, usually accompanies crime. But my time is\r\nprecious, and the star that rules your destiny will set, and your fate\r\nbe involved in darkness, unless I proceed to business immediately. The\r\nstar informs me, madam, that you are a widow.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ La! sir, were you acquainted with my deceased husband?\r\n\r\n_F. T._ No, madam; we do not receive our knowledge by such means. Thy\r\nname is Mary, and thy dwelling-place is Boston.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Some spirit must have told you this, for certain.\r\n\r\n_F. T._ This is not all, madam. You were married at the age of twenty\r\nyears, and were the sole heir of your deceased husband.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ I perceive, sir, you know _every_ thing.\r\n\r\n_F. T._ Madam, I can not help knowing what I _do_ know; I must therefore\r\ninform you that your adopted daughter, in the dead of night--\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ No, sir; it was in the day-time.\r\n\r\n_F. T._ Do not interrupt me, madam. In the dead of night, your adopted\r\ndaughter planned the robbery which deprived you of your wedding-ring.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ No earthly being could have told you this, for I never let my\r\nright hand know that I possessed it, lest some evil should happen to it.\r\n\r\n_F. T._ Hear me, madam; you have come all this distance to consult the\r\nfates, and find your ring.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ You have guessed my intention exactly, sir.\r\n\r\n_F. T._ Guessed\'! madam\'. I _know_ this is your object; and I know,\r\nmoreover, that your ungrateful daughter has incurred your displeasure,\r\nby receiving the addresses of a worthless man.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Every word is gospel truth.\r\n\r\n_F. T._ This man has persuaded your daughter--\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ I knew he did, I told her so. But good sir, can you tell me\r\nwho has the ring?\r\n\r\n_F. T._ This young man has it.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ But he denies it.\r\n\r\n_F. T._ No matter, madam, he has it.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ But how shall I obtain it again?\r\n\r\n_F. T._ The law points out the way, madam,--it is _my_ business to point\r\nout the rogue,--you must catch him.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ You are right, sir,--and if there is law to be had, I will\r\nspend every cent I own, but I will have it. I knew he was the robber,\r\nand I thank you for the information. [_Going_.]\r\n\r\n_F. T._ But thanks, madam, will not pay for all my nightly vigils,\r\nconsultations, and calculations.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Oh, right, sir! I forgot to pay you. What am I indebted to\r\nyou?\r\n\r\n_F. T._ Only five dollars, madam.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ [_Handing him the money_.] There it is, sir. I would have paid\r\ntwenty rather than not have found the ring.\r\n\r\n_F. T._ I never take but five, madam. Farewell, madam, your friend is at\r\nthe door with your chaise.\r\n\r\n[_He leaves the room_.]\r\n\r\n[_Enter, Friend_.]\r\n\r\n_Friend_. Well, Mary, what does the fortune-teller say?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Oh, he told me I was a widow, and lived in Boston, and had an\r\nadopted daughter,--and----\r\n\r\n_Friend._ But you knew all this before, did you not?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Yes; but how should _he_ know it? He told me, too, that I had\r\nlost a ring,--\r\n\r\n_Friend._ Did he tell you where to find it?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Oh yes! he says that fellow has it, and I must go to law and\r\nget it, if he will not give it up. What do you think of that?\r\n\r\n_Friend._ It is precisely what any fool could have told you. But how\r\nmuch did you pay for this precious information?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Only five dollars.\r\n\r\n_Friend._ How much was the ring worth?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Why, two dollars, at least.\r\n\r\n_Friend._ Then you have paid ten dollars for a chaise to bring you here,\r\nfive dollars for the information that you had already, and all this to\r\ngain possession of a ring not worth one quarter of the expense!\r\n\r\n_Mrs. C._ Oh, the rascal! how he has cheated me! I will go to the\r\nworld\'s end but I will be revenged.\r\n\r\n_Friend._ You had better go home, and say nothing about it; for every\r\neffort to recover your money, will only expose your folly.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

Many years ago, three beautiful sisters came into our world to\r\nlighten the burdens of earth\'s toiling pilgrims, and aid them in\r\npreparation for a higher state of existence. Alike commissioned by the\r\nGreat Father, they were sent on errands of mercy, and were not to turn\r\naway from scenes of darkness, sorrow, and suffering.\r\n\r\n2. FAITH had a firm, unfaltering step; HOPE, a beaming eye, ever turned\r\nto the future; and LOVE, a pitying glance, and a helping hand. They\r\njourneyed confidingly together; and when they found a stricken being in\r\ndanger of perishing by the wayside, FAITH soothingly whispered, "My\r\nFather doeth all things well;" HOPE pointed to the cooling shade just in\r\nadvance; and LOVE assisted him to rise, and aided his feeble steps.\r\n\r\n3. Groups of fair children played near the path in which they were\r\ntraveling. Some of these did not understand the tones of FAITH; but they\r\nall listened eagerly to the alluring strains of HOPE, who painted\r\nbrighter scenes than those they were enjoying, and flowers more fragrant\r\nthan any they yet had gathered. LOVE delighted to linger with the\r\nyouthful band, lessening their trials, and increasing their pleasures.\r\n\r\n4. Her gentle touch arrested the little hand that was lifted against a\r\nplaymate, and her soothing voice calmed the angry passions which were\r\nswelling in the bosom. When a child stumbled in the way, she tenderly\r\nraised it up again, or when a thorn pierced the unwary finger, she\r\nkindly removed it, and bound up the bleeding wound.\r\n\r\n5. While the sisters were busy in their appropriate mission, a\r\npale-cheeked lad mingled with the group of merry children, though too\r\nweak to share their sports. FAITH stole to his side, and whispered of\r\nthe great Parent above, who afflicts in wisdom, and chastens in love.\r\nHis eye brightened while she spoke, and he looked upward with that trust\r\nand submission which he had never before experienced.\r\n\r\n6. Then HOPE came, with visions of returning health, when his frame\r\nwould be strong and his heart buoyant. But when HOPE and FAITH were\r\ngone, again his head drooped, and the tear started. Then LOVE sat down\r\nby the invalid, twining a garland of summer blossoms for his pale brow,\r\nand singing sweet melodies which charmed his listening ear. The pain was\r\nall gone now; smiles wreathed his pallid lips, and the sick boy laughed\r\nas merrily as his more robust companions.\r\n\r\n7. The sisters, in their journeyings, entered the abode of poverty. It\r\nwas a humble dwelling, and yet it looked cheerful, yea, even inviting,\r\nwhen the three graced it with their presence. FAITH shed a spirit of\r\ncalm contentment and heavenly trust in those lowly walls; HOPE whispered\r\nof the better mansions prepared for the followers of the Lamb; and LOVE,\r\nnot less exalted than her sisters, threw a charm over the meager fare\r\nand scanty attire of the inmates. FAITH taught them to offer the daily\r\nprayer in trusting confidence; HOPE pointed beyond this world to joys\r\nwhich eye hath not seen, nor ear heard; while LOVE lessened each burden,\r\nand increased each simple pleasure. FAITH, HOPE, and CHARITY! ye,\r\nindeed, can make a paradise of the humblest home!\r\n\r\n8. There was a darkened chamber, with a wan form tossing restlessly upon\r\nthe couch. Wealth was there; but it could not allay pain, or prolong\r\nlife. FAITH, noiseless as a spirit form, glided to the sick one\'s side.\r\n"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him," was her language, as she\r\npointed upward. HOPE fain would have whispered of length of days, but\r\nshe knew this could not be; so she spoke of life eternal, where there is\r\nno more pain. Then LOVE smoothed the pillow, and bathed the fevered\r\nbrow, pausing not in her tender ministries through the night-watches.\r\nWhen morning dawned, the spirit of the sick man passed away, though not\r\nuntil FAITH, and HOPE, and LOVE had assuaged the anguish of the parting\r\npang.\r\n\r\n9. Weeping mourners gathered around the dead. There were tears,--for\r\n"tears well befit earth\'s partings;" there was sorrow,--for what\r\nbitterness is like unto that of the bereaved, when the grave opens to\r\ninfold the heart\'s best treasure? Yet FAITH, and HOPE, and LOVE were\r\nthere, assuaging those tears, and mitigating that sorrow. FAITH, even\r\nwhile her cheeks were wet, exclaimed, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath\r\ntaken away; blessed be the name of the Lord."\r\n\r\n10. HOPE\'S language was, "Not lost, but gone before;" and her eye,\r\nhaving lost none of its brightness, saw with prophetic vision a reunion\r\nyet to come. LOVE tenderly wiped away each gathering tear, and gave\r\ndeeper fervency to the trusting confidence of FAITH, and the inspiring\r\nstrains of HOPE. And when the sleeper was committed to the dust, these\r\ngentle sisters lingered in the lonely house, and by the darkened hearth.\r\n\r\n11. Such are FAITH, HOPE, and CHARITY,--given by God to lighten human\r\nsorrow, and bless the creatures He has made. They have each a mission to\r\nfulfill,--different, it is true, and yet they move in harmony. FAITH\r\nenables us to submit trustingly to daily trials, viewing a kind Father\'s\r\nhand in each passing event. HOPE, when the sky is dark, and the path\r\nthorny, points not only to fairer scenes below, but to that brighter\r\nworld where there is no night and no sorrow.\r\n\r\n12. LOVE lightens every burden, and reflects upon earth a faint\r\nradiation of heavenly blessedness,--for the Scriptures assure us that\r\n"God is love: and every one that loveth is born of God." The time will\r\ncome when, the purposes of the wise Creator being accomplished, Faith\r\nand Hope will cease. Faith will be lost in sight, Hope in fruition; but\r\nLove will remain, binding the spirits of the redeemed in blissful\r\ncommunion, and uniting them to God the Father and Christ the Elder\r\nBrother.\r\n\r\n13. Faith, Hope, and Charity! blessed spirits! May they be inmates of\r\nevery heart! May they assist each of us in the peculiar trials which\r\nnone can know but ourselves! They will come to us if we seek their\r\npresence; but they must be carefully nurtured. Let us cherish them in\r\nour bosoms, and they will bless us constantly in our pilgrimage below,\r\nand conduct us to the presence of our God.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLESSON LXVIII.\r\n\r\n   TRANSPORT\' ED, highly delighted.\r\n   THREAT\' EN ING, impending.\r\n   COR\' O NAL, crown; chaplet.\r\n   MYR\' I AD, innumerable.\r\n   LUS\' CIOUS, delicious.\r\n   LUS TY, strong; vigorous.\r\n   WAR\' BLING, singing; caroling.\r\n   CHURL, sour, surly man.\r\n   RE FRESH\', cool; make fresh.\r\n   LAN\' GUID, dull; sluggish.\r\n   DROUTH\' Y, dry; arid.\r\n   SUS TAIN\', uphold; support.\r\n   UN GRUDG\'ING, free-hearted; liberal.\r\n   NIG GARD, miser; stingy person.\r\n\r\n\r\n"NOT TO MYSELF ALONE."\r\n\r\nS.W.

It is the impression of many, that only in summer, including spring\r\nand autumn, of course, is the _country_ desirable as a residence. The\r\ncountry in summer, and the city for the winter. It is true, that the\r\nwinter gives attractions to the city, in endless meetings, lectures,\r\nconcerts, and indoor amusements; but it is not true that the country\r\nloses all interest when the leaves are shed and the grass is gone. On\r\nthe contrary, to one who has learned how to use his senses and his\r\nsensibilities, there are attractions in the winter of a peculiar kind,\r\nand pleasures which can be reaped only then.\r\n\r\n2. It appears to me, that winter comes in to relieve the year of\r\nsatiety. The mind grows sated with greenness. After eight or nine months\r\nof luxuriant growths, the eye grows accustomed to vegetation. To be\r\nsure, we never are less pleased with the wide prospect; with forms of\r\nnoble trees, with towns and meadows, and with the whole aspect of\r\nnature. But it is the pleasure of one pampered. We lose the keen edge of\r\nhunger. The eye enjoys, without the relish of newness. We expect to\r\nenjoy. Every thing loses surprise.\r\n\r\n3. Of course, the sky is blue, the grass succulent, the fields green,\r\nthe trees umbrageous, the clouds silent and mysterious. They were so\r\nyesterday, they are so to-day, they will be so to-morrow, next week,\r\nnext month. In short, the mind does not cease to feel the charm of\r\nendless growths; but needs variety, change of diet, less of perpetual\r\nfeasting, and something of the blessings of a fast. _This_ winter gives.\r\nIt says to us: You have had too much. You are luxurious and dainty. You\r\nneed relief and change of diet.\r\n\r\n4. The cold blue of the sky, the cold gray of rocks, the sober warmth of\r\nbrowns and russets, take the place of more gorgeous colors. If, now, one\r\nwill accept this change in the tone of nature, after a time a new and\r\nrelishful pleasure arises. The month formed by the last fortnight of\r\nNovember and the first two weeks of December, is, to me, the saddest of\r\nthe year. It most nearly produces the sense of desolateness and\r\ndreariness of any portion of the year.\r\n\r\n5. From the hour that the summer begins to shorten its days, and\r\nregister the increasing change along the horizon, over which the sun\r\nsets, farther and farther toward the south, we have a genial and gentle\r\nsadness. But sadness belongs to all very deep joys. It is almost as\r\nneedful to the perfectness of joy, as shadows in landscapes are to the\r\ncharm of the picture. Then, too, comes the fading out of flowers,--each\r\nvariety in its turn, saying, "Farewell till next summer."\r\n\r\n6. Scarcely less suggestive of departing summer are the new-comers, the\r\nlate summer golden-rod, the asters, and all autumnal flowers. Long\r\nexperience teaches us that these are the latest blossoms that fall from\r\nthe sun\'s lap, and next to them is snow. By association we already see\r\nwhite in the yellow and blue. Then, too, birds are thinking of other\r\nthings. No more nests, no more young, no more songs,--except\r\nsignal-notes and rallying-calls; for they are evidently warned, and go\r\nabout their little remaining daily business, as persons who expect every\r\nhour to depart to a distant land.\r\n\r\n7. It is scarcely ever that we see the birds _go_. They are here to-day,\r\nand gone to-morrow. They disappear without observation. The fields are\r\nempty and silent. It seems as if the winds had blown them away with the\r\nleaves. The first sight of northern waterfowl, far up in the air,\r\nretreating from Labrador and the short, Arctic summer, is always to us\r\nlike the declaration: "Summer is gone; winter is behind us; it will soon\r\nbe upon you." At last come the late days of November. All is\r\ngone,--frosts reap and glean more sharply every night.\r\n\r\n8. A few weeks bring earnest winter. Then begin to dawn other delights.\r\nThe bracing air, the clean snow-paths, the sled and sleigh, the\r\nrevelation of forms that all summer were grass-hidden; the\r\nsharp-outlined hills lying clear upon the sky; the exquisite tracery of\r\ntrees,--especially of all such trees as that dendral child of God, the\r\nelm, whose branches are carried out into an endless complexity of fine\r\nlines of spray, and which stands up in winter, showing in its whole\r\nanatomy, that all its summer shade was founded upon the most substantial\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n9. In winter, too, particularly in the latter periods of it, the\r\nextremities of shrubs and branches begin to take on ruddy hues, or\r\npurplish browns, and the eye knows that these are the first faint\r\nblushes of coming summer. Now, too, we find how beautiful are the mosses\r\nin the woods; and under them we find solitary green leaves, that have\r\nlaughed all winter because they had outwitted the frost.\r\n\r\n10. Wherever flowing springs gush from sheltered spots looking south,\r\none will find many green edges, young grass, and some few tougher\r\nleaves. Now, too, in still days, the crow swings heavily through the\r\nair, cawing with a pleasing harshness. For dieting has performed its\r\nwork. Your appetite is eager. A little now pleases you more than\r\nabundance did in August. Every tiny leaf is to you like a cedar of\r\nLebanon.\r\n\r\n11. All these things are unknown to dwellers in cities. It is nothing to\r\nthem that a robin appeared for the first time yesterday morning, or that\r\na blue-bird sang over against the house. Some new _prima-donna_ [Footnote:\r\nThe first female singer in an opera.] exhausts their admiration. They are\r\nyet studying laces, and do not care for the of swamps, for the first\r\ncatkins of the willow. They are still coveting the stores of precious\r\nstones at the jewelers, and do not care for my ruby buds, and red\r\ndogwood, and scarlet winter berries, and ground pine, and partridge-berry\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n12. There is one sight of the country, at about this time of the\r\nyear--the first of March--that few have seen, or else they have passed\r\nit by as if it were not worthy of record. I mean the drapery of rocks in\r\ngorges, or along precipitous sides of hills or mountains. The seams of\r\nrocks are the outlets of springs. The water, trickling through, is\r\nseized by the frost, and held fast in white enchantment. Every day adds\r\nto the length of the ice drapery; and, as the surface is overlaid by new\r\nissuings, it is furred and fretted with silver-white chasings, the most\r\nexquisite.\r\n\r\n13. Thus, one may find a succession, in a single gorge, of extraordinary\r\nice-curtains, and pendent draperies, of varying lengths, of every\r\nfantastic form, of colors varying by thickness, or by the tinge of earth\r\nor rock shining through them. In my boyhood, I used to wander along\r\nthese fairy halls, imagining them to be now altars in long, white\r\ndraperies; now, grand cathedral pillars of white marble; then, long\r\ntapestries chased in white, with arabesques [Headnote 1] and crinkled\r\nvines and leaves.\r\n\r\n14. Sometimes they seemed like gigantic bridal decorations, or like the\r\nrobes of beings vast and high, hung in their wardrobes while they slept.\r\nBut, whatever fancy interpreted them, or whether they were looked upon\r\nwith two good, sober, literal eyes, they were, and still are, among the\r\nmost delightful of winter exhibitions, to those who are wise enough to\r\nsearch out the hidden beauty of winter in the country.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

Since Sunday, [Feb. 1st, 1852,] we have had presented to our view,\r\nthe beautiful phenomenon of FROSTED TREES, the most astonishing and\r\nbrilliant that I ever remember to have noticed. The previous storm and\r\nmist had thickly covered every exposed object,--the loftiest trees, the\r\nminutest blade, hill and dale, with the icy garment. This transparency\r\nwas most perfect, defining every form and ramification into exact models\r\nof the entire body, branch, or limb.\r\n\r\n3. Dwellings and barns were incrusted by the chilling vapor. It hung\r\nupon the manes of the cattle, and decorated, wherever seen, the humble\r\ngrass, which appeared bending, like threads of crystal. The small bushes\r\nwere indescribably beautiful, and seemed as if chiseled out of the\r\nwhitest marble. As far as the eye could extend, over brooks, fields, and\r\nwoods, the same striking and singular sight was universal.\r\n\r\n4. I could not remain contented in the house, and toward sunset,\r\nhastened away, where the view might be free and uninterrupted. Here, the\r\nscene, if possible, was more impressive and interesting. There was\r\nscarcely a breath of air, and the general silence was only interrupted\r\nby the occasional flight of some winter bird, which, alighting on a\r\nlimb, would shake down a thousand feathery showers, until he seemed\r\nfrightened at the unusual sound. The forest trees made a truly majestic\r\nappearance, with their naked, giant arms and mossy branches intersecting\r\neach other, and fast bound by the frozen barriers.\r\n\r\n5. I shall not attempt to describe the brilliancy of the undergrowth and\r\ndwarf trees, upon whose limbs hung a delicate frosting, like unwrought\r\nsilver, nor the crimson glow of the holly-berries through their\r\ntransparent and icy covering,--all, all was a dazzling and splendid\r\nwinter array,\r\n\r\n  "That buries wide the works of man."\r\n\r\nIt brought to my mind some of the Eastern fairy tales, and their gardens\r\nornamented with shrubs and plants of sparkling crystals.\r\n\r\n6. The exposed sides of the rocks and fences were completely iced over,\r\nnot the smallest particle escaping the penetrating and congealed ether.\r\nIt was truly astonishing to examine its thickness. On some twigs, not\r\nlarger than a wheat straw, the ice measured half an inch through. One\r\nwould scarcely imagine what an immense weight of the frozen mass a tree\r\nwill sustain, before it breaks under the unusual load. Many branches\r\nwere bent so low that I could reach them with my hands; and, shaking off\r\ntheir frosted barks, they would instantly spring far above my reach.\r\nEvery few minutes, I was startled by the rattling noise of these falling\r\nicicles from some neighboring tree or grove.\r\n\r\n7. Just when the sun went down, there was not a single cloud to be seen\r\nin the horizon, and his cold, bright, setting rays brought out, on every\r\nhand, frozen gems, diamonds, rubies, and sapphires, in every possible\r\nprismatic beauty, wherever his departing beams fell. Presently the moon\r\nbathed the whitened earth, and every congealed drop, in her soft light,\r\nburnishing, with dazzling icy brilliancy, trees, dwellings, and streams.\r\nI am an ardent lover of Nature and her scenery, and have often,\r\ndelighted, gazed upon the Queen of Night; but _never_ did I behold such\r\na brilliant moonlight night as this.\r\n\r\n8. Who could help bringing to mind the sublimities of Job and of\r\nDavid,--"The hoary frost of heaven, who hath engendered it? The waters\r\nare hid, as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen."--"By the\r\nbreath of the Mighty God, ice is produced, and the waters which were\r\nspread on all sides, are held in chains." The Psalmist says, "He giveth\r\nthe snow like wool, He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes. Wash me,\r\nand I shall be whiter than snow."--Well may poets look to the falling\r\nsnow-flake for their images of purity and innocence, ere it receives the\r\nstain of earth. I know of no litter emblem.\r\n\r\n9. Such a winter\'s night! _and the skies! the skies!_ So resplendent in\r\nbrightness are the hosts of heaven at this moment, that they should be\r\ncontemplated by every lover and student of the works of God. Their\r\nnumbers who can count,--their twinkling beauty who can describe, as\r\nonward they roll in the deep blue of midnight? In their contemplation\r\nare inspired "thoughts that wander through eternity," with an elevation\r\nof feeling, as if we were separated from the toils and tumults of earth,\r\nand exalted into a higher state of being than that in which we toiled\r\nthrough the day! These heavens tell us of a WISDOM and POWER we can not\r\nsearch or estimate. There we seem to stand more immediately in the\r\nvailed presence of the Infinite Majesty, who "laid the foundations of\r\nthe earth, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God\r\nshouted for joy."\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

WALCHNER.\r\n\r\n1. Sir Walter of Thurn, over the Syrian waste,\r\n     Rides away with a flowing rein;\r\n   But he hears a groan that checks his haste,\r\n     As if death were in the strain.\r\n         He spurs his steed\r\n         Whence the sounds proceed;\r\n     And there, from a rocky chasm, arise\r\n     Fierce cries of pain, that assail the skies;\r\n         And his horse uprears\r\n         In excess of fears,\r\n     As the glance of a lion attracts his eyes.\r\n\r\n2. Fierce struggling there in the monster folds\r\n     Of a serpent that round him twines;\r\n   Sir Walter a moment the scene beholds,\r\n     Then to save the beast inclines.\r\n         His good sword stout\r\n         From its sheath leaps out,\r\n     When down it falls on the Python\'s [Headnote 1] crest,\r\n     And cleaves the coils that the lion invest;\r\n         And the noble beast,\r\n         From its thrall released,\r\n     Shows grateful joy most manifest.\r\n\r\n3. He shakes his mane, and bends his form,\r\n     And licks his preserver\'s hand,\r\n   As if he yields allegiance warm\r\n     To his supreme command.\r\n         Like the faithful hound\r\n         To be constant found,\r\n     And follow his steps for evermore;\r\n     And thus he follows, on sea and shore,\r\n         In the battle\'s tide,\r\n         He stands by his side,\r\n     Or with him rests when the strife is o\'er.\r\n\r\n4. In Palestine Sir Walter is known,--\r\n     Long years attest his fame;\r\n   And many brave deeds he there hath done,\r\n     That ray with glory his name;\r\n         But his heart doth expand\r\n         For the fatherland,\r\n     And he fain its pleasant scenes would see,\r\n     With his friendly lion for company;\r\n         But with fearful breast,\r\n         The sailors protest,\r\n     As they glanced at the beast and his majesty.\r\n\r\n5. Rich guerdon he proffers, and golden store;\r\n     But though the prize were great,\r\n   The sailors hurry away from the shore\r\n     As if from the doom of fate.\r\n         The poor beast moans\r\n         In piteous tones,\r\n     Then darts impetuously o\'er the sands,--\r\n     Then looks to the ship, and mournfully stands;\r\n     Then plunges into the gloomy wave,\r\n     The perils of the depths to brave.\r\n     Already he nears the flying bark,\r\n     Already his roar of grief they hark;\r\n     But his strength is spent, and the sea is strong,\r\n     And he may not the fearful struggle prolong.\r\n     His dying glances are fondly cast\r\n     Along the track where the loved one passed;\r\n         Then sinks to his grave\r\n         Beneath the wave,\r\n     And the night and the ocean behold him the last.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

Think you he would\r\nexchange his joys for the pleasures of sense\'? It is of a higher and\r\nmore ennobling character, and not to be bartered for paltry wealth.\r\n\r\n2. What dignity and self-respect invest the man of thought! His very\r\nlooks bespeak of mind. He is approached with deference, as a being of\r\nhigher order in the scale of intelligence,--as one who has a right to\r\ncommand and be obeyed. For what moves mind, but mind?

It is the _developed intellect_ that flies through the upper\r\nair, that mingles with the stars, that follows the moon in her course,\r\nthat overtakes the constellations in their orbits, that weighs the sun,\r\nthat measures the distance to the polar star.

Let the reader suppose himself on the deck of a South-seaman,\r\ncruising in the North Pacific ocean. He may be musing over some past\r\nevent, the ship may be sailing gently along over the smooth ocean, every\r\nthing around solemnly still, with the sun pouring its intense rays with\r\ndazzling brightness. Suddenly the monotonous quietude is broken by an\r\nanimated voice from the masthead, exclaiming, _"There he spouts!"_\r\n\r\n2. The captain starts on deck in an instant, and inquires _"Where\r\naway?"_ but, perhaps, the next moment every one aloft and on deck, can\r\nperceive an enormous whale lying about a quarter of a mile from the\r\nship, on the surface of the sea, having just come up to breathe,--his\r\nlarge "hump" projecting three feet out of the water. At the end of every\r\nten seconds, the spout is seen rushing from the fore part of his\r\nenormous head, followed by the cry of every one on board, who join in\r\nthe chorus of _"There again!"_ keeping time with the duration of the\r\nspout.\r\n\r\n3. But, while they have been looking, a few seconds have expired. They\r\nrush into the boats, which are directly lowered to receive them; and in\r\ntwo minutes from the time of first observing the whale, three or four\r\nboats are down, and are darting through the water with their utmost\r\nspeed toward their intended victim, perhaps accompanied with a song from\r\nthe headsman, who urges the quick and powerful plying of the oar, with\r\nthe common whaling chant of\r\n\r\n  "Away, my boys, away, my boys, \'tis time for us to go."\r\n\r\n4. But, while they are rushing along, the whale is breathing; they have\r\nyet, perhaps, some distance to pull before they can get a chance of\r\nstriking him with the harpoon. His "spoutings are nearly out," he is\r\nabout to descend, or he hears the boats approaching. The few sailors\r\nleft on board, and who are anxiously watching the whale and the gradual\r\napproach of the boats, exclaim, _"Ah, he is going down!"_ Yet he spouts\r\nagain, but slowly, the water is seen agitated around him; the spectators\r\non board with breathless anxiety think they perceive him rising in\r\npreparation for his descent. _"He will be lost!"_ they exclaim; for the\r\nboats are not yet near enough to strike him, and the men are still\r\nbending their oars in each boat with all their strength, to claim the\r\nhonor of the first blow with the harpoon.\r\n\r\n5. The bow-boat has the advantage of being the nearest to the whale; the\r\nothers, for fear of disturbing the unconscious monster, are now ordered\r\nto drop astern. One more spout is seen slowly curling forth,--it is his\r\nlast; but the boat shoots rapidly alongside of the gigantic creature.\r\n_"Peak your oars!"_ exclaims the mate, and directly they flourish in the\r\nair; the glistening harpoon is seen above the head of the harpooner. In\r\nan instant it is darted with unerring force and aim, and is buried\r\ndeeply in the side of the huge animal. It is "socket up;" that is, it is\r\nburied in his flesh up to the socket which admits the handle or pole of\r\nthe harpoon.\r\n\r\n6. A cheer from those in the boats, and from the seamen on board,\r\nreverberates along the still deep at the same moment. The sea, which a\r\nmoment before was unruffled, now becomes lashed into foam by the immense\r\nstrength of the wounded whale, which, with its vast tail, strikes in all\r\ndirections at his enemies. Now his enormous head rises high into the\r\nair, then his flukes are seen lashing everywhere, his huge body writhes\r\nin violent contortions from the agony the harpoon has inflicted. The\r\nwater all around him is a mass of foam, and the sounds of the blows from\r\nhis tail on the surface of the sea, can be heard for miles!\r\n\r\n7. _"Stern all!"_ cries the headsman; but the whale suddenly disappears;\r\nhe has "sounded;" the line is running through the groove at the head of\r\nthe boat, with lightning-like velocity; it smokes; it ignites from the\r\nheat produced by the friction; but the headsman, cool and collected,\r\npours water upon it as it passes. But an oar is now held up in their\r\nboat; it signifies that their line is rapidly running out; two hundred\r\nfathoms are nearly exhausted; up flies one of the other boats, and\r\n"bends on" another line, just in time to save that which was nearly\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n8. But still the monster descends; he is seeking to rid himself of his\r\nenemies by descending deeply into the dark and unknown depths of the\r\nvast ocean. Two more lines are exhausted,--he is _six hundred fathoms\r\ndeep! "Stand ready to bend on!"_ cries the mate to the fourth boat; (for\r\nsometimes they take the whole four lines away with them,--_eight hundred\r\nfathoms!!_) but, it is not required, he is rising. _"Haul in the\r\nslack!"_ observes the headsman, while the boat-steerer coils it again\r\ncarefully into the tubs as it is drawn up.\r\n\r\n9. The whale is now seen approaching the surface; the gurgling and\r\nbubbling water which rises, proclaims that he is near; his nose starts\r\nfrom the sea; the rushing spout is projected high and suddenly, from his\r\nagitation. The slack of the line is now coiled in the tubs, and those in\r\nthe fast boat, haul themselves gently toward the whale. The boat-steerer\r\nplaces the headsman close to the fin of the trembling animal, who\r\nimmediately buries his long lance in the vitals of the leviathan, while,\r\nat the same moment, those in one of the other boats, dart another\r\nharpoon into his opposite side. Then, _"Stern all!"_ is again\r\nvociferated, and the boats shoot rapidly away from the danger.\r\n\r\n10. Mad with the agony which he endures from these fresh attacks, the\r\ninfuriated "sea monster" rolls over and over, and coils an amazing\r\nlength of line around him. He rears his enormous head, and, with\r\nwide-expanded jaws, snaps at every thing around him. He rushes at the\r\nboats with his head,--they are propelled before him with vast swiftness,\r\nand sometimes utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\n11. He is lanced again,--and his pain appears more than he can bear. He\r\nthrows himself, in his agony, completely out of his element; the boats\r\nare violently jerked, by which one of the lines is snapped asunder; at\r\nthe same time the other boat is upset, and its crew are swimming for\r\ntheir lives. The whale is now free! he passes along the surface with\r\nremarkable swiftness, "going head out;" but the two boats that have not\r\nyet "fastened," and are fresh and free, now give chase.\r\n\r\n12. The whale becomes exhausted from the blood which flows from his deep\r\nand dangerous wounds, and the two hundred fathoms of line belonging to\r\nthe overturned boat, which he is dragging after him through the water,\r\nchecks him in his course; his pursuers again overtake him, and another\r\nharpoon is darted and buried deeply in his flesh.\r\n\r\n13. The fatal lance is, at length, given; the blood gushes from the\r\nnostrils of the unfortunate animal in a thick, black stream, which\r\nstains the clear blue water of the ocean to a considerable distance\r\naround the scene of the affray. The immense creature may now again\r\nendeavor to "sound," to escape from his unrelenting pursuers; but he is\r\npowerless. He soon rises to the surface, and passes slowly along until\r\nthe death-pang seizes him, when his appearance is awful in the extreme.\r\n\r\n14. Suffering from suffocation, or from the stoppage of some important\r\norgan, the whole strength of his enormous frame is set in motion, for a\r\nfew seconds, when his convulsions throw him into a hundred different\r\ncontortions of the most violent description, by which the sea is beaten\r\ninto foam, and boats are sometimes crushed to atoms, with their crews.\r\n\r\n15. But this violent action being soon over, the now unconscious animal\r\npasses rapidly along, describing in his rapid course the segment of a\r\ncircle; this is his "flurry," which ends in his sudden dissolution. The\r\nmighty rencounter is finished. The gigantic animal rolls over on his\r\nside, and floats an inanimate mass on the surface of the crystal\r\ndeep,--a victim to the tyranny and selfishness, as well as a wonderful\r\nproof of the _great power of the mind of man_.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

My hour had now come, and I entered the car. With a singular taste,\r\nthe band struck up, at this moment, the melting air of "Sweet Home." It\r\nalmost overcame me. A thousand associations of youth, friends, of all\r\nthat I must leave, rushed upon my mind. But I had no leisure for\r\nsentiment. A buzz ran through the assemblage; unnumbered hands were\r\nclapping, unnumbered hearts beating high; and _I_ was the cause. Every\r\neye was upon me. There was pride in the thought.\r\n\r\n2. "Let go!" was the word. The cheers redoubled; handkerchiefs waved\r\nfrom many a fair hand; bright faces beamed from every window, and on\r\nevery side. One dash with my knife, and I rose aloft, a habitant of air.\r\nHow magnificent was the sight which now burst upon me! How sublime were\r\nmy sensations! I waved the flag of my country; the cheers of the\r\nmultitude from a thousand housetops, reached me on the breeze; and a\r\ntaste of the rarer atmosphere elevated my spirits into ecstasy.\r\n\r\n3. The city, with a brilliant sunshine striking the spires and domes,\r\nnow unfolded to view a sight incomparably beautiful. My gondola went\r\neasily upward, cleaving the depths of heaven like a vital thing. A\r\ndiagram placed before you, on the table, could not permit you to trace\r\nmore definitely than I now could, the streets, the highways, basins,\r\nwharves, and squares of the town. The hum of the city arose to my ear,\r\nas from a vast bee-hive; and I seemed the monarch-bee, directing the\r\nswarm.\r\n\r\n4. I heard the rattling of carriages, the hearty _yo-heavo-s!_ of\r\nsailors from the docks that, begirt with spars, hemmed the city round. I\r\nwas a spectator of all, yet aloof, and alone. Increasing stillness\r\nattended my way; and, at last, the murmurs of earth came to my ear like\r\nthe vast vibrations of a bell. My car tilted and trembled, as I rose. A\r\nswift wind sometimes gave the balloon a rotary motion, which made me\r\ndeathly sick for a moment; but strong emotion conquered all my physical\r\nailings.\r\n\r\n5. My brain ached with the intensity of my rapture. Human sounds had\r\nfainted from my ear. I was in the abyss of heaven, and _alone_ with my\r\nGod. I could tell my direction by the sun on my left; and, as his rays\r\nplayed on the aerostat, it seemed only a bright bubble, wavering in the\r\nsky, and I, a suspended mote, hung by chance to its train. Looking below\r\nme, the distant Sound and Long Island appeared to the east; the bay lay\r\nto the south, sprinkled with shipping; under me, the city, girded with\r\nbright rivers and sparry forests.\r\n\r\n6. The free wind was on my cheek, and in my locks; afar, the ocean\r\nrolled its long, blue waves, checkered with masses of shadow, and gushes\r\nof ruby sunlight; to the north and west, the interminable land,\r\nvariegated like a map, dotted with purple, and green, and silver, faded\r\nto the eye. The atmosphere which I now breathed, seemed to dilate my\r\nheart at every breath. I uttered some audible expressions. My voice was\r\nweaker than the faintest sound of a reed. There was no object near to\r\nmake it reverb or echo.\r\n\r\n7. My barometer now denoted an immense hight; and, as I looked upward\r\nand around, the concave above seemed like a mighty waste of purple air,\r\nverging to blackness. Below, it was lighter; but a long, lurid bar of\r\ncloud stretched along the west, temporarily excluding the sun. The\r\nshadows rushed afar into the void, and a solemn, Sabbath twilight\r\nreigned around. I was now startled by a fluttering in my gondola. It was\r\nmy carrier-pigeon. I had forgotten him entirely. I attached a string to\r\nhis neck, with a label, announcing my hight, then nearly four miles, and\r\nthe state of the barometer.\r\n\r\n8. As he sat on the side of the car, and turned his tender eyes upon me\r\nin mute supplication, every feather shivering with apprehension, I felt\r\nthat it was a guilty act to push him into the waste beneath. But it was\r\ndone; he attempted to rise, but I out-sped him; he then fell obliquely,\r\nfluttering and moaning, till I lost him in the haze. My greatest\r\naltitude had not yet been reached. I was now five miles from _terra\r\nfirma_. [Footnote: Solid earth.] I began to breathe with difficulty. The\r\natmosphere was too rare for safe respiration.\r\n\r\n9. I pulled my valve-cord to descend. It refused to obey my hand. For a\r\nmoment I was horror-struck. What was to be done? If I ascended much\r\nhigher, the balloon would explode. I threw over some tissue paper to\r\ntest my progress. It is well known that this will _rise_ very swiftly.\r\nIt _fell_, as if blown downward by a wind from the zenith. I was going\r\nupward like an arrow. I attempted to pray, but my parched lips could not\r\nmove. I seized the cord again, with desperate energy. Blessed Heaven! it\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\n10. I threw out more tissue. It rose to me like a wing of joy. I was\r\ndescending. Though far from sunset, it was now dark about me, except a\r\ntrack of blood-red haze in the direction of the sun. I encountered a\r\nstrong current of wind; mist was about me; it lay like dew upon my coat.\r\nAt last, a thick bar of vapor being past, what a scene was disclosed! A\r\nstorm was sweeping through the sky, nearly a mile beneath; and I looked\r\ndown upon an ocean of rainbows, rolling in indescribable grandeur, to\r\nthe music of the thunder-peal, as it moaned afar and near, on the coming\r\nand dying wind.\r\n\r\n11. A frightened eagle had ascended through the tempest, and sailed for\r\nminutes by my side, looking at me with panting weariness, and quivering\r\nmandibles, but with a dilated eye, whose keen iris flashed unsubdued.\r\nProud emblem of my country! As he fanned me with his heavy wing, and\r\nlooked with a human intelligence at the car, my pulse bounded with\r\nexulting rapture. Like the genius of my native land, he had risen above\r\nevery storm, unfettered and FREE.\r\n\r\n12. But my transports were soon at an end. He attempted to light on the\r\nballoon, and my heart sunk; I feared his huge claws would tear the silk.\r\nI pulled my cord; he rose, as I sank, and the blast swept him from my\r\nview in a moment. A flock of wild-fowl, beat by the storm, were coursing\r\nbelow, on bewildered pinions; and, as I was nearing them, I knew I was\r\ndescending. A breaking rift now admitted the sun. The rainbows tossed\r\nand gleamed; chains of fleecy rack, shining in prismatic rays of gold,\r\nand purple, and emerald, "beautiful exceedingly," spread on every hand.\r\n\r\n13. Vast curtains of clouds pavilioned the immensity, brighter than\r\ncelestial roses; masses of mist were lifted on high, like strips of\r\nliving fire, more radiant than the sun himself, when his glorious\r\nnoontide culminates from the equator. A kind of aerial Euroclydon now\r\nsmote my car, and three of the cords parted, which tilted my gondola to\r\nthe side, filling me with terror. I caught the broken cords in my hand,\r\nbut could not tie them.\r\n\r\n14. The storm below was now rapidly passing away, and beneath its waving\r\noutline, to the south-east, I saw the ocean. Ships were speeding on\r\ntheir course, and their bright sails melting into distance; a rainbow\r\nhung afar; and the rolling anthems of the Atlantic came like celestial\r\nhymnings to my ear. Presently all was clear below me. The fresh air\r\nplayed around. I had taken a noble circuit; and my last view was better\r\nthan the first, I was far over the bay, "afloating sweetly to the west."\r\nThe city, colored by the last blaze of day, brightened remotely to the\r\nview.\r\n\r\n15. Below, ships were hastening to and fro through the Narrows, and the\r\nfar country lay smiling like an Eden. Bright rivers ran like ribbons of\r\ngold and silver, till they were lost in the vast inland, stretching\r\nbeyond the view; the gilded mountains were flinging their purple shadows\r\nover many a vale; bays were blushing to the farewell day-beams; and now\r\nI was passing over a green island. I sailed to the mainland; saw the\r\ntall, old trees waving to the evening breeze; heard the rural lowing of\r\nherds, and the welcome sound of human voices; and, finally, sweeping\r\nover forest-tops and embowered villages, at last, descended with the\r\nsun, among a kind-hearted, surprised, and hospitable community, in as\r\npretty a town as one could desire to see, "safe and well."\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

SAXE.\r\n\r\n 1. "Once on a time," as ancient tales declare,\r\n      There lived a farmer in a quiet dell\r\n    In Massachusetts, but exactly where,\r\n      Or when, is really more than I can tell,--\r\n    Except that quite above the public bounty,\r\n      He lived within his means and Bristol county.\r\n\r\n 2. By patient labor and unceasing care,\r\n      He earned, and so enjoyed, his daily bread;\r\n    Contented always with his frugal fare,\r\n      Ambition to be rich ne\'er vexed his head;\r\n    And thus unknown to envy, want, or wealth,\r\n      He flourished long in comfort, peace, and health.\r\n\r\n 3. The gentle partner of his humble lot,\r\n      The joy and jewel of his wedded life,\r\n    Discharged the duties of his peaceful cot,\r\n      Like a true woman and a faithful wife;\r\n    Her mind improved by thought and useful reading,\r\n      Kind words and gentle manners showed her breeding.\r\n\r\n 4. Grown old, at last, the farmer called his son,\r\n      The youngest, (and the favorite I suppose,) And said,--\r\n    "I long have thought, my darling John,\r\n      \'Tis time to bring my labors to a close;\r\n    So now to toil I mean to bid adieu,\r\n      And deed, my son, the homestead-farm to you."\r\n\r\n 5. The boy embraced the boon with vast delight,\r\n      And promised, while their precious lives remained,\r\n    He\'d till and tend the farm from morn till night,\r\n      And see his parents handsomely maintained;\r\n    God help him, he would never fail to love, nor\r\n      Do aught to grieve his gen\'rous old gov\'nor.\r\n\r\n 6. The farmer said,--"Well, let us now proceed,\r\n      (You know there\'s always danger in delay,)\r\n    And get \'Squire Robinson to write the deed;\r\n      Come,--where\'s my staff?--we\'ll soon be on the way."\r\n    But John replied, with tender, filial care,\r\n      "You\'re old and weak--I\'ll catch the Dapple Mare."\r\n\r\n 7. The mare was saddled, and the old man got on,\r\n      The boy on foot trudged cheerfully along,\r\n    The while, to cheer his sire, the duteous son\r\n      Beguiled the weary way with talk and song.\r\n    Arrived, at length, they found the \'Squire at home,\r\n      And quickly told him wherefore they had come.\r\n\r\n 8. The deed was writ in proper form of law,\r\n      With many a "foresaid," "therefore," and "the same,"\r\n    And made throughout without mistake or flaw,\r\n      To show that John had now a legal claim\r\n    To all his father\'s land--conveyed, given, sold,\r\n      Quit-claimed, et cetera,[Footnote 1]--to have and hold.\r\n\r\n 9. Their business done, they left the lawyer\'s door,\r\n      Happier, perhaps, than when they entered there;\r\n    And started off as they had done before,--\r\n      The son on foot, the father on the mare.\r\n    But ere the twain a single mile had gone,\r\n      A brilliant thought occurred to Master John.\r\n\r\n10. Alas for truth!--alas for filial duty!--\r\n      Alas that Satan in the shape of pride,\r\n    (His most bewitching form save that of beauty,)\r\n      Whispered the lad--"My boy, you ought to ride!"\r\n    "Get off!" exclaimed the younker--"\'t isn\'t fair\r\n      That you should always ride the Dapple Mare!"\r\n\r\n11. The son was lusty, and the sire was old,\r\n      And so, with many an oath and many a frown,\r\n    The hapless father did as he was told;\r\n      The man got off the steed, the boy got on,\r\n    And rode away as fast as she could trot,\r\n      And left his sire to trudge it home on foot!\r\n\r\n12. That night, while seated round the kitchen fire\r\n      The household sat, cheerful as if no word\r\n    Or deed, provoked the injured father\'s ire,\r\n      Or aught to make him sad had e\'er occurred,--\r\n    Thus spoke he to his son: "We quite forgot,\r\n      I think, t\'include that little turnip lot!"\r\n\r\n13. "I\'m very sure, my son, it wouldn\'t hurt it,"\r\n      Calmly observed the meditative sire,\r\n    "To take the deed, my lad, and just insert it;"\r\n      Here the old man inserts it--_in the fire!_\r\n    Then cries aloud with most triumphant air,\r\n      "Who now, my son, shall ride the Dapple Mare?"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: And so forth.]\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

A shudder ran through every vein,--\r\n     All eyes were turned on high!\r\n   There stood the boy, with dizzy brain,\r\n     Between the sea and sky!\r\n   No hold had he above,--below,\r\n     Alone he stood in air!\r\n   At that far hight none dared to go,--\r\n     No aid could reach him there.\r\n\r\n3. We gazed,--but not a man could speak;\r\n     With horror all aghast,\r\n   In groups, with pallid brow and cheek,\r\n     We watched the quivering mast!\r\n   The atmosphere grew thick and hot,\r\n     And of a lurid hue,\r\n   As, riveted unto the spot,\r\n     Stood officers and crew.\r\n\r\n4.

He gasped,\r\n     "O God, Thy will be done!"\r\n   Then suddenly a rifle grasped,\r\n     And aimed it at his son!\r\n   "Jump far out, boy, into the wave!\r\n     Jump, or I fire!" he said.\r\n   "That only chance your life can save:\r\n(\'\') Jump! jump, boy!"

In the State of New York, where the dark, foaming waters of the Black\r\nRiver, after roaring and surging through many pleasant fields, beautiful\r\ngroves, and dense woodlands, commingle with the clear, cold waters of\r\nLake Ontario, the wandering pedestrian or the lone fisherman may see,\r\nresting upon a gravelly flat, the remains of an _old Indian canoe_,\r\nwhose once beautiful proportions, now untraceable in its rottenness,\r\nbore a prominent part in the tragic event I am about to narrate.\r\n\r\n2. Through these pleasant valleys, among the broken hills, and in the\r\nmajestic forests, of yore, the wily Indian and his dusky mate, held\r\nundisputed possession; and many are the incidents, yet unwritten, of\r\ntragic and thrilling interest, that transpired around the red men\'s\r\ncamp-fire, ere the white man disturbed their forest homes.\r\n\r\n3. Si ous\' ka, or the "Wild Flower," was the daughter of a powerful\r\nchief of the Onondagas, and the only being ever known to turn the\r\nrelentless old chief from a savage purpose. Something of this influence\r\nwas owing to her great beauty; but more to the gentleness of which that\r\nbeauty was the emblem. Her downcast eye, her trembling lip, her quiet,\r\nsubmissive motion, all bespoke its language; and many were the young\r\nchieftains that sought to win her affections.\r\n\r\n4. Among her admirers were two young chiefs of the Oneidas, with whom\r\nthe Onondagas were on the most friendly terms. Si ous\' ka\'s father, in\r\norder to cherish the friendly feeling of the two tribes, and, at the\r\nsame time, strengthen his power, besought her to accept the more\r\npowerful chief, "Eagle Eye." He did not plead in vain; for she had long\r\nloved the young Oneida.\r\n\r\n5. One bright sunny morning, in early spring, as the old chief was out\r\nhunting, the young Oneida crossed his path, upon which the old man\r\nadvanced, and, laying his hand upon his shoulder, pointed to the\r\ndwelling of Si ous\' ka. Not a word was spoken. The proud old man and the\r\nstrong, young chief proceeded toward her wigwam, and entered together.\r\n\r\n6. Si ous\' ka was seated in one corner, engaged upon some fancy\r\nbasket-work, and did not notice their approach until they had entered.\r\nThe old chief looked upon her with an expression of love, which his\r\nstern countenance never wore except in her presence. "Sious\'ka," he said\r\nin a subdued tone, "Go to the wigwam of the Oneida, that your father\'s\r\ntribe may be strengthened, and many moons may shine upon their peace and\r\nprosperity."\r\n\r\n7. There was mingled joy and modesty in the upward glance of the "Wild\r\nFlower" of the Onondagas, and, when the young chief saw the light of her\r\nmild eye suddenly and timidly vailed by its deeply-fringed lid, he knew\r\nthat her love had lost none of its power. The marriage song was soon\r\nsung in the royal wigwam, in which the sweet voice of Sious\'ka was\r\nhappily heard to mingle.\r\n\r\n8. When the rejected chief of the Oneidas heard that the "Wild Flower"\r\nhad mated with the "Eagle Eye," his wrath knew no bounds, and he\r\nsecretly resolved upon revenge. Two years passed away, and, as yet, no\r\ngood opportunity had arrived; for he dared not attack "Eagle Eye" in\r\nopen conflict, for fear of his superior powers; and, assassin-like, he\r\nsought to give the blow unperceived.\r\n\r\n9. At length, the spring came, and a number of the tribe prepared to\r\nvisit Lake Ontario, on a fishing and hunting excursion. Among the number\r\nwho went, were the "Eagle Eye," Sious\'ka, and their little boy. They\r\nwere obliged to carry their light, birchen canoes from home, and these\r\nwere packed with the necessary tackle, skins for beds, &c. The strong\r\nmen of the party carried the canoes on their shoulders, and the women\r\nthe smaller articles of furniture.\r\n\r\n10. They had advanced across the country, until they reached the Black\r\nRiver, and, by carrying their canoes around falls and rapids, gently\r\nfloated down the stream till they reached the great falls, about six\r\nmiles from the Lake. Here they halted for the night, and encamped about\r\nhalf a mile above the falls.\r\n\r\n11. The morning came; and, as the first beam of the rising sun pierced\r\nthe forest shade, the party again embarked in their canoes for the mouth\r\nof the river, the gaudy canoe of Si ous\' ka, which her father had given\r\nher, taking the lead. They had scarcely started from the shore, ere the\r\nsharp twang of a bow-string was heard from the shore, and an unerring\r\narrow pierced the heart of "Eagle Eye." He fell over the side of the\r\ncanoe, and was swept by the current over the great falls.\r\n\r\n12. The party immediately started in pursuit of the coward murderer; but\r\nthey sought in vain. His hiding-place was too sure,--he had taken refuge\r\nin a cave, the entrance of which was hid from observation by a thick\r\nclump of cedars. Here he remained till he was certain the company had\r\ndeparted. This cave is still there, and I have often been in its many\r\nchambers,--some of which are very spacious.\r\n\r\n13. The fatal shaft was winged from the bow of the revenged Oneida\r\nchief. Having been apprised of the expedition, he had warily dogged the\r\nsteps of the party, until a favorable opportunity presented itself, and\r\nthen satisfied his secret longing for revenge upon the enemy, whom he\r\ndid not dare to attack even-handed. The party sought him far and near;\r\nbut, as no trace of any one could be found, they imagined, with\r\nsuperstitious fear, that the "Great Spirit" had thus summoned "Eagle\r\nEye" to the "Spirit\'s Hunting Ground."\r\n\r\n14. When they returned to their canoes, no traces of Si ous\' ka and her\r\nchild were to be found. They, too, had mysteriously disappeared, and the\r\nwhole party, with ominous silence, hastened around the falls, and away\r\nfrom the fearful place. When Si ous\' ka saw the fatal shaft pierce her\r\ncompanion, with, a fearful shriek she fell into the bottom of the canoe,\r\nhid herself in the furs, and immediately her reason forsook her.\r\n\r\n15. When she recovered, she found that her canoe, urged on by the\r\ncurrent, had floated into a large cave, and was firmly wedged in between\r\ntwo rocks; and her little boy, with his bow and arrow in his hand, was\r\nquietly sleeping by her side. Dislodging the canoe, she plied the oars,\r\nand was soon outside the cave.\r\n\r\n16. On finding her people had left her, she sought the shore, and,\r\nfastening the canoe, proceeded below the falls, where she found the body\r\nof the ill-fated "Eagle Eye," where it had washed ashore. With\r\nsuperhuman strength, she bore the mangled body to a thick grove of\r\ncedars, and, with her own hands, dug a rude grave, and covered his\r\nremains with dried leaves and earth. That night she kept her lonely\r\nwatch beside the grave of all that she held dear on earth, save her boy,\r\nintending to follow the party on the morrow.\r\n\r\n17. The morning came, and the mid-day sun began to descend toward the\r\nwestern hills, ere she left the grave of the murdered chief. But, at\r\nlength, she sorrowfully departed; and, on arriving where she moored the\r\ncanoe the day before, what was her surprise to see the murderer of her\r\nhusband, quietly sleeping upon the skins where last "Eagle Eye" had\r\nreposed, in the bow of the canoe.\r\n\r\n18. From that moment Si ous\' ka was changed. Her quiet, submissive air\r\nimmediately gave place to fierce sternness, and the eye that had always\r\nbeamed with the smile of love, shot forth flashes of bitter hate and\r\npassion, implacable as the most bloodthirsty of her tribe. Noiselessly\r\nthrowing the oars from the boat, with a wild shriek, she quickly swung\r\nit around into the rapidly rolling current, and it was hurried toward\r\nthe brink of that awful cataract, over which no living being had ever\r\npassed alive.\r\n\r\n19. The young chief, awakened by that fearful, exulting cry of revenge,\r\nand seeing the peril of his situation, leaped from the bark that was\r\nhurrying him to sure destruction, and vainly sought to gain the shore.\r\nAfter struggling with the swift tide for a moment, in which he was\r\ncarried nearer and nearer the awful brink, he turned, and, with a wild,\r\nunearthly yell, plunged over, and the boiling waters only responded to\r\nhis death-wail, as he sunk to rise no more, and his spirit joined that\r\nof his victim in the "Spirit Land."\r\n\r\n20. After the gentle "Wild Flower" had avenged the death of the "Eagle\r\nEye," she returned to her father\'s wigwam, and spent the remainder of\r\nher life to the memory of her heart\'s first devotion. The canoe, all\r\nbattered and broken, floated to the mouth of the river, bottom side up,\r\nwhere it was seen by one of the party while fishing, drawn to the shore,\r\nand left to decay. The party supposed that "Eagle Eye," Sious\'ka, and\r\nher child, had all perished in some mysterious manner.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. Who was Sious\'ka? 2. Who became her husband? 3. What\r\neffect had her marriage upon the rejected Oneida chief? 4. In what way\r\ndid he seek revenge? 5.

Many of us who are advanced beyond the period of childhood, went out\r\nfrom home to embark on the stormy sea of life. Of the feelings of a\r\nfather, and of his interest in our welfare, we have never entertained a\r\ndoubt, and our home was dear because he was there; but there was a\r\npeculiarity in the feeling that it was the home of our mother. Where\r\n_she_ lived, there was a place that we felt was _home_. There was _one\r\nplace_ where we would always be welcome, _one place_ where we would be\r\nmet with a smile, _one place_ where we would be sure of a friend.\r\n\r\n2. The world might be indifferent to us. We might be unsuccessful in our\r\nstudies or our business. The new friends which we supposed we had made,\r\nmight prove to be false. The honor which we thought we deserved, might\r\nbe withheld from us. We might be chagrined and mortified by seeing a\r\nrival outstrip us, and bear away the prize which we sought. But there\r\n_was_ a place where no feelings of rivalry were found, and where those\r\nwhom the world overlooked, would be sure of a friendly greeting. Whether\r\npale and wan by study, care, or sickness, or flushed with health and\r\nflattering success, we were _sure_ that we should be welcome there.\r\n\r\n3. Though the world was cold toward us, yet there was _one_ who always\r\nrejoiced in our success, and always was affected in our reverses; and\r\nthere was a _place_ to which we might go back from the storm which began\r\nto pelt us, where we might rest, and become encouraged and invigorated\r\nfor a new conflict. So have I seen a bird, in its first efforts to fly,\r\nleave its nest, and stretch its wings, and go forth to the wide world.\r\nBut the wind blew it back, and the rain began to fall, and the darkness\r\nof night began to draw on, and there was no shelter abroad, and it\r\nsought its way back to its nest, to take shelter beneath its mother\'s\r\nwings, and to be refreshed for the struggles of a new day; but then it\r\nflew away to think of its nest and its mother no more.\r\n\r\n4. But not thus did we leave our home when we bade adieu to it to go\r\nforth alone to the manly duties of life. Even amidst the storms that\r\nthen beat upon us, and the disappointments that we met with, and the\r\ncoldness of the world, we felt still that there _was one_ who\r\nsympathized in our troubles, as well as rejoiced in our success, and\r\nthat, whatever might be abroad, when we entered the door of her\r\ndwelling, we should be met with a smile. We expected that a mother, like\r\nthe mother of Sisera [Headnote 1], as she "looked out at her window,"\r\nwaiting for the coming of her son laden with the spoils of victory,\r\nwould look out for _our_ coming, and that _our_ return would renew her\r\njoy and ours in our earlier days.\r\n\r\n5. It makes a sad desolation when, from such a place, a mother is taken\r\naway, and when, whatever may be the sorrows or the successes in life,\r\nshe is to greet the returning son or daughter no more. The home of our\r\nchildhood may be still lovely. The old family mansion--the green\r\nfields--the running stream--the moss-covered well--the trees--the\r\nlawn--the rose--the sweet-brier--may be there. Perchance, too, there may\r\nbe an aged father, with venerable locks, sitting in his loneliness, with\r\nevery thing to command respect and love; but she is not there. Her\r\nfamiliar voice is not heard. The mother has been borne forth to sleep by\r\nthe side of her children who went before her, and the place is not what\r\nit was.\r\n\r\n6. There may be those there whom we much love; but _she_ is not there.\r\nWe may have formed new relations in life, tender and strong as they can\r\nbe; we may have another home, dear to us as was the home of our\r\nchildhood, where there is all in affection, kindness, and religion, to\r\nmake us happy; but _that_ home is not what it was, and it will _never_\r\nbe what it was again. It is a loosening of one of the cords which bound\r\nus to earth, designed to prepare us for our eternal flight from every\r\nthing dear here below, and to teach us that there is _no_ place here,\r\nthat is to be our permanent home.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. What renders home doubly endearing? 2. Where are we\r\nalways welcome? 3. Who always rejoices in our successes, and is affected\r\nin our reverses? 4. Who was Sisera, and what account is given of him?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXXIII.\r\n\r\n   UN SPOT\' TED, pure; unstained.\r\n   FAL\' TER, fail.\r\n   TRA\' CER Y, traces; impressions.\r\n   IM\' PRESS, mark: stamp.\r\n   DO MIN\' ION, authority; predominance.\r\n   SHRINK, withdraw.\r\n   PUR SU\' ING, following.\r\n   STERN ER, harsher; more rigid.\r\n   DE FY\', dare; challenge.\r\n   WHO\' SO, any person whatever.\r\n   TO\' KEN, sign; indication.\r\n   BROTH\' ER HOOD, fraternity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE-BOOK.\r\n\r\nHOME JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n1.

HOLLAND.\r\n\r\n1. The first great lesson a young man should learn, is, that _he knows\r\nnothing;_ and that the earlier and more thoroughly this lesson is\r\nlearned, the better it will be for his peace of mind, and his success in\r\nlife. A young man bred at home, and growing up in the light of parental\r\nadmiration and fraternal pride, can not readily understand how it is,\r\nthat every one else can be his equal in talent and acquisition. If bred\r\nin the country, he seeks the life of the town, he will very early obtain\r\nan idea of his insignificance.\r\n\r\n2. This is a critical period in his history. The result of his reasoning\r\nwill decide his fate. If, at this time, he thoroughly comprehend, and in\r\nhis soul admit and accept the fact, that _he knows nothing_ and _is\r\nnothing;_ if he bow to the conviction that his mind and his person are\r\nbut ciphers, and that whatever he is _to be_, and is _to win_, must be\r\nachieved by _hard work_, there is abundant hope of him.\r\n\r\n3. If, on the contrary, a huge self-conceit still hold possession of\r\nhim, and he straightens stiffly up to the assertion of his old and\r\nvalueless self,--or, if he sink discouraged upon the threshold of a life\r\nof fierce competitions, and more manly emulations, he might as well be a\r\ndead man. The world has no use for such a man, and he has only to retire\r\nor be trodden upon.\r\n\r\n4. When a young man has thoroughly comprehended the fact that _he knows\r\nnothing_, and that, intrinsically, he is of but _little value_, the next\r\nthing for him to learn is that _the world cares nothing for him_,--that\r\nhe is the subject of no man\'s overwhelming admiration and esteem,--that\r\nhe must take care of himself.\r\n\r\n5. If he be a stranger, he will find every man busy with his own\r\naffairs, and none to look after him. He will not be noticed until he\r\nbecomes _noticeable_, and he will not become noticeable, until he _does\r\nsomething_ to prove that he has an absolute value in society. No letter\r\nof recommendation will give him this, or ought to give him this. No\r\nfamily connection will give him this, except among those few who think\r\nmore of blood than brains.\r\n\r\n6. Society demands that a young man _shall be somebody_, not only, but\r\nthat _he shall prove his right to the title_; and it has a right to\r\ndemand this. Society will not take this matter upon trust,--at least,\r\nnot for a long time; for it has been cheated too frequently. Society is\r\nnot very particular what a man does, so that it prove him to be a _man_:\r\nthen it will bow to him, and make room for him.\r\n\r\n7. There is no surer sign of an unmanly and cowardly spirit, than a\r\nvague desire for _help_,--a wish to _depend_, to _lean_ upon somebody,\r\nand enjoy the fruits of the industry of others. There are multitudes of\r\nyoung men who indulge in dreams of help from some quarter, coming in at\r\na convenient moment, to enable them to secure the success in life which\r\nthey covet. The vision haunts them of some benevolent old gentleman,\r\nwith a pocket full of money, a trunk full of mortgages and stocks, and a\r\nmind remarkably appreciative of merit and genius, who will, perhaps,\r\ngive or lend them from ten to twenty thousand dollars, with which they\r\nwill commence and go on swimmingly.\r\n\r\n8. To me, one of the most disgusting sights in the world, is that of a\r\nyoung man with healthy blood, broad shoulders, and a hundred and fifty\r\npounds, more or less, of good bone and muscle, standing with his hands\r\nin his pockets, longing for help. I admit that there are positions in\r\nwhich the most independent spirit may accept of assistance,--may, in\r\nfact, as a choice of evils, desire it; but for a man who is able to help\r\nhimself, to desire the help of others in the accomplishment of his plans\r\nof life, is positive proof that he has received a most unfortunate\r\ntraining, or that there is a leaven of meanness in his composition, that\r\nshould make him shudder.\r\n\r\n9. When, therefore, a young man has ascertained and fully received the\r\nfact that he does not know any thing, that the world does not care any\r\nthing about him, that what he wins must be won by his own brain and\r\nbrawn, and that while he holds in his own hands the means of gaining his\r\nown livelihood and the objects of his life, he can not receive\r\nassistance without compromising his self-respect and selling his\r\nfreedom, he is in a fair position for beginning life. When a young man\r\nbecomes aware that only by _his own efforts_ can he rise into\r\ncompanionship and competition with the sharp, strong, and well-drilled\r\nminds around him, he of ready for work, and not before.\r\n\r\n10. The next lesson is, that of _patience_, thoroughness in preparation,\r\nand contentment with the regular channels of business effort and\r\nenterprise. This is, perhaps, one of the most difficult to learn, of all\r\nthe lessons of life. It is natural for the mind to reach out eagerly for\r\nimmediate results.\r\n\r\n11. As manhood dawns, and the young man catches in its first light the\r\npinnacles of realized dreams, the golden domes of high possibilities,\r\nand the purpling hills of great delights, and then looks down upon the\r\nnarrow, sinuous, long, and dusty path by which others have reached\r\nthem, he is apt to be disgusted with the passage, and to seek for\r\nsuccess through broader channels, by quicker means. Beginning at the\r\nvery foot of the hill, and working slowly to the top, seems a very\r\ndiscouraging process; and precisely at this point, have thousands of\r\nyoung men made shipwreck of their lives.\r\n\r\n12. Let this be understood, then, at starting; that the patient conquest\r\nof difficulties, which rise in the regular and legitimate channels of\r\nbusiness and enterprise, is not only essential in securing the successes\r\nwhich you seek, but it is essential to that preparation of your mind,\r\nrequisite for the enjoyment of your successes, and for retaining them\r\nwhen gained. It is the general rule of Providence, the world over, and\r\nin all time, that unearned success is a curse. It is the rule of\r\nProvidence, that the process of earning success, shall be the\r\npreparation for its conservation and enjoyment.\r\n\r\n13. So, day by day, and week by week; so, month after month, and year\r\nafter year, _work on_, and in that process gain strength and symmetry,\r\nand nerve and knowledge, that when success, patiently and bravely worked\r\nfor, shall come, it may find you prepared to receive it and keep it. The\r\ndevelopment which you will get in this brave and patient labor, will\r\nprove itself, in the end, the most valuable of your successes. It will\r\nhelp to make a _man_ of you. It will give you power and self-reliance.\r\nIt will give you not only _self-respect_, but the _respect of your\r\nfellows and the public_.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

He was a pupil of Socrates.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESUMPTION OF YOUTH.\r\n\r\nROLLIN.\r\n\r\n1. The young people of Athens, amazed at the glory of\r\nThemistocles,[Headnote 1] of Cimon,[Headnote 2] of Pericles,[Headnote 3]\r\nand full of a foolish ambition, after having received some lessons from\r\nthe sophists, who promised to render them very great politicians,\r\nbelieved themselves capable of every thing, and aspired to fill the\r\nhighest places. One of them, named Glaucon, took it so strongly in his\r\nhead that he had a _peculiar genius_ for public affairs, although he was\r\nnot yet twenty years of age, that no person in his family, nor among his\r\nfriends, had the power to divert him from a notion so little befitting\r\nhis age and capacity.\r\n\r\n2. Socrates, who liked him on account of Plato [Headnote 4] his brother,\r\nwas the only one who succeeded in making him change his resolution.\r\nMeeting him one day, he accosted him with so dexterous a discourse, that\r\nhe induced him to listen. He had already gained much influence over him.\r\n"You have a desire to govern the republic?" said Socrates. "True,"\r\nreplied Glaucon. "You can not have a finer design," said the\r\nphilosopher, "since, if you succeed in it, you will be in a state to\r\nserve your friends, to enlarge your house, and to extend the limits of\r\nyour native country.\r\n\r\n3. "You will become known not only in Athens, but through all Greece;\r\nand it may be that your renown will reach even to the barbarous nations,\r\nlike that of Themistocles. At last, you will gain the respect and\r\nadmiration of everybody." A beginning so flattering pleased the young\r\nman exceedingly, and he very willingly continued the conversation.\r\n"Since you desire to make yourself esteemed and respected, it is clear\r\nthat you think to render yourself useful to the public." "Assuredly."\r\n"Tell me, then, I beseech you, what is the first service that you intend\r\nto render the state?"\r\n\r\n4. As Glaucon appeared to be perplexed, and considered what he ought to\r\nanswer,--"Probably," replied Socrates, "it will be to enrich the\r\nrepublic, that is to say, to increase its revenues." "Exactly so." "And,\r\nundoubtedly, you know in what the revenues of the state consist, and the\r\nextent to which they may be increased. You will not have failed to make\r\nit a private study, to the end that if one source should suddenly fail,\r\nyou may be able to supply its place immediately with another." "I assure\r\nyou," answered Glaucon, "that this is what I have never thought of."\r\n\r\n5. "Tell me, at least, then, the necessary expenses of maintaining the\r\nrepublic. You can not fail to know of what importance it is to retrench\r\nthose which are superfluous." "I confess to you that I am not more\r\ninstructed with regard to this article than the other." "Then it is\r\nnecessary to defer till another time the design that you have of\r\nenriching the republic; for it is impossible for you to benefit the\r\nstate while you are ignorant of its revenues and expenses."\r\n\r\n6. "But," said Glaucon, "there is still another means that you pass over\r\nin silence,--one can enrich a state by the ruin of its enemies." "You\r\nare right." replied Socrates, "but, in order to do that, you must be the\r\nmore powerful; otherwise you run the risk of losing that which you\r\npossess. So, he who speaks of undertaking a war, ought to know the power\r\nof both parties, to the end that if he finds his party the stronger, he\r\nmay boldly risk the adventure; but, if he find it the weaker, he should\r\ndissuade the people from undertaking it.\r\n\r\n7. "But, do you know what are the forces of our republic, by sea and by\r\nland, and what are those of our enemies\'? have you a statement of them\r\nin writing\'? You will do me the pleasure to allow me a perusal of it."\r\n"I have none yet," replied Glaucon. "I see, then," said Socrates, "that\r\nwe shall not make war so soon, if they intrust _you_ with the\r\ngovernment; for there remain many things for you to know, and many cares\r\nto take."\r\n\r\n8. The sage mentioned many other articles, not less important, in which\r\nhe found Glaucon equally inexperienced, and he pointed out how\r\nridiculous they render themselves, who have the rashness to intermeddle\r\nwith government, without bringing any other preparation to the task than\r\n_a great degree of self-esteem and excessive ambition_. "Fear, my dear\r\nGlaucon," said Socrates, "fear, lest a too ardent desire for honors\r\nshould blind you; and cause you to take a part that would cover you with\r\nshame, in bringing to light your incapacity, and want of talent."\r\n\r\n9. The youth was wise enough to profit by the good advice of his\r\ninstructor, and took some time to gain private information, before he\r\nventured to appear in public. This lesson is for all ages.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. To what did the young people of Athens aspire? 2. What\r\ndid Glaucon believe he possessed? 3.

WEEKS.\r\n\r\n1. On the afternoon of December 29th, 1862, she put on steam, and, in\r\ntow of the "Rhode Island," passed Fortress Monroe, and out to sea. As we\r\ngradually passed out, the wind freshened somewhat; but the sun went down\r\nin glorious clouds of purple and crimson, and the night was fair and\r\ncalm above us, though, in the interior of our little vessel, the air had\r\nalready begun to lose its freshness. We suffered more or less from its\r\ncloseness through the night, and woke in the morning to find it heavy\r\nwith impurity, from the breaths of some sixty persons, composing the\r\nofficers and crew.\r\n\r\n2. Sunshine found us on deck, enjoying pure air, and watching the east.\r\nDuring the night we had passed Cape Henry, and now, at dawn, found\r\nourselves on the ocean,--the land only a blue line in the distance. A\r\nfew more hours, and that had vanished. No sails were visible; and the\r\nPassaic, which we had noticed the evening before, was now out of sight.\r\nThe morning and afternoon passed quietly; we spent most of our time on\r\ndeck, on account of the confined air below, and, being on a level with\r\nthe sea, with the spray dashing over us occasionally, amused ourselves\r\nwith noting its shifting hues and forms, from the deep green of the\r\nfirst long roll, to the foam-crest and prismatic tints of the falling\r\nwave.\r\n\r\n3. As the afternoon advanced, the freshening wind, the thickening\r\nclouds, and the increasing roll of the sea, gave those most accustomed\r\nto ordinary ship-life, some new experiences. The little vessel plunged\r\nthrough the rising waves, instead of riding them, and, as they increased\r\nin violence, lay, as it were, under their crests, which washed over her\r\ncontinually; so that, even when we considered ourselves safe, the\r\nappearance was that of a vessel sinking.\r\n\r\n4. "I\'d rather go to sea in a diving-bell!" said one, as the waves\r\ndashed over the pilot-house, and the little craft seemed buried in\r\nwater. "Give me an oyster-scow!" cried another,--"any thing! only let it\r\nbe _wood_, and something that will float _over_, instead of _under_ the\r\nwater!" Still she plunged on; and about 6:30 P.M., we made Cape\r\nHatteras; in half an hour we had rounded the point. A general hurrah\r\nwent up,--"Hurrah for the first iron-clad that ever rounded Cape\r\nHatteras! Hurrah for the little boat that is first in every thing!"\r\n\r\n5. At half-past seven, a heavy shower fell, lasting about twenty\r\nminutes. At this time the gale increased; black, heavy clouds covered\r\nthe sky, through which the moon glittered fitfully, allowing us to see\r\nin the distance a long line of white, plunging foam rushing toward\r\nus,--sure indication, to a sailor\'s eye, of a stormy time. A gloom\r\noverhung every thing; the banks of cloud seemed to settle around us; the\r\nmoan of the ocean grew louder and more fearful. Still our little boat\r\npushed doggedly on: victorious through all, we thought that here, too,\r\nshe would conquer, though the beating waves sent shudders through her\r\nwhole frame.\r\n\r\n6. An hour passed; the air below, which had all day been increasing in\r\ncloseness, was now almost stifling; but our men lost no courage. Some\r\nsang as they worked; and the cadence of their voices, mingling with the\r\nroar of waters, sounded like a defiance to Ocean. Some stationed\r\nthemselves on top of the turret, and a general enthusiasm filled all\r\nbreasts, as huge waves, twenty feet high, rose up on all sides, hung\r\nsuspended for a moment like jaws open to devour, and then, breaking,\r\ngnashed over in foam from side to side.\r\n\r\n7. Those of us new to the sea, and not apprehending our peril, hurrahed\r\nfor the largest wave; but the captain and one or two others, old\r\nsailors, knowing its power, grew momentarily more and more--anxious,\r\nfeeling, with a dread instinctive to the sailor, that, in case of\r\nextremity, no wreck yet known to ocean, could be so hopeless as this.\r\nSolid iron from keelson to turret-top, clinging to any thing for safety,\r\nif the "Monitor" should go down, would only insure a share in her fate.\r\nNo mast., no spar, no floating thing, to meet the outstretched hand in\r\nthe last moment.\r\n\r\n8. The sea gathered force from each attack. Thick and fast came the\r\nblows on the iron mail of the "Monitor," and still the brave little\r\nvessel held her own, until, at half-past eight, the engineer, faithful\r\nto the end, reported a leak. The pumps were instantly set in motion, and\r\nwe watched their progress with an intense interest. She had seemed to\r\nus like an old-time knight, in armor, battling against fearful odds, but\r\nstill holding his ground. We who watched, when the blow came which made\r\nthe strong man reel and the life-blood spout, felt our hearts faint\r\nwithin us; then, again, ground was gained, and the fight went on, the\r\nwater lowering somewhat under the laboring pumps.\r\n\r\n9. From nine to ten it kept pace with them. From ten to eleven the sea\r\nincreased in violence, the waves now dashing entirely over the turret,\r\nblinding the eyes, and causing quick catchings of the breath, as they\r\nswept against us. At ten the engineer had reported the leak as gaining\r\non us; at half-past ten, with several pumps in constant motion, one of\r\nwhich threw out three thousand gallons a minute, the water was rising\r\nrapidly, and nearing the fires. When these were reached, the vessel\'s\r\ndoom was sealed; for, with their extinction, the pumps must cease, and\r\nall hope of keeping the "Monitor" above water more than an hour or two,\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\n10. Our knight had received his death-blow, and lay struggling and\r\nhelpless under the power of a stronger than he. A consultation was\r\nheld, and, not without a conflict of fueling, it was decided that\r\nsignals of distress should be made. Ocean claimed our little vessel, and\r\nher trembling frame and failing fire proved she would soon answer his\r\ncall; yet a pang went through us, as we thought of the first iron-clad\r\nlying alone at the bottom of this stormy sea, her guns silenced, herself\r\na useless mass of metal. Each quiver of her strong frame seemed to plead\r\nwith us not to abandon her.\r\n\r\n11. The work she _had_ done, the work she _was_ to do, rose before us:\r\nmight there not be a possibility of saving her yet? Her time could not\r\nhave come so soon. But we who descended for a moment to the cabin, knew,\r\nby the rising-water through which we waded, that the end was near. Small\r\ntime was there for regrets. Rockets were thrown up, and answered by the\r\n"Rhode Island," whose brave men prepared at once to lower boats, though,\r\nin that wild sea, it was almost madness.\r\n\r\n12. The "Monitor" had been attached to the "Rhode Island" by two\r\nhawsers, one of which had parted at about seven P.M. The other remained\r\nfirm; but now it was necessary it should be cut. How was that possible,\r\nwhen every wave washed clean over the deck? What man could reach it\r\nalive? "Who\'ll cut the hawser?" shouted Captain Bankhead. Acting master\r\nStodder volunteered, and was followed by another. Holding by one hand to\r\nthe ropes at her side, they cut through, by many blows of the hatchet,\r\nthe immense rope which united the vessels. Stodder returned in safety,\r\nbut his brave companion was washed over, and went down.\r\n\r\n13. Meanwhile the boat launched from the "Rhode Island," had started,\r\nmanned by a crew of picked men. A mere heroic impulse could not have\r\naccomplished this most noble deed. For hours they had watched the raging\r\nsea. Their captain and _they_ knew the danger; every man who entered\r\nthat boat, did it at the peril of his life; and yet all were ready. Are\r\nnot such acts as these convincing proofs of the divinity of human\r\nnature\'? We watched her with straining eyes; for few thought she could\r\nlive to reach us. She neared; we were sure of her, thank Heaven!\r\n\r\n14. In this interval, the cut hawser had become entangled in the\r\npaddle-wheel of the "Rhode Island," and she drifted down upon us; we,\r\nnot knowing this fact, supposed her coming to our assistance; but a\r\nmoment undeceived us. The launch sent to our relief was now between us\r\nand her,--too near for safety. The steamer bore swiftly down, stern\r\nfirst, upon our starboard quarter. "_Keep off! keep off!_" we cried, and\r\nthen first saw she was helpless.\r\n\r\n15. Even as we looked, the devoted boat was caught between the steamer\r\nand the iron-clad,--a sharp sound of crushing wood was heard,--thwarts,\r\noars, and splinters flew in air,--the boat\'s crew leaped to the\r\n"Monitor\'s" deck, Death stared us in the face; our iron prow must go\r\nthrough the Rhode Island\'s side,--and then an end to all. One awful\r\nmoment we held our breath,--then the hawser was cleared,--the steamer\r\nmoved off, as it were, step by step, first one, then another, till a\r\nship\'s length lay between us, and then we breathed freely.\r\n\r\n16. But the boat!--had she gone to the bottom, carrying brave souls with\r\nher? No; there she lay, beating against our iron sides; but still,\r\nthough bruised and broken, a lifeboat to us. There was no hasty scramble\r\nfor life when it was found she floated,--all held back. The men kept\r\nsteady on at their work of bailing,--only those leaving, and in the\r\norder named, whom the captain bade save themselves. They descended from\r\nthe turret to the deck with mingled fear and hope, for the waves tore\r\nfrom side to side, and the coolest head and bravest heart could not\r\nguaranty safety. Some were washed over as they left the turret, and,\r\nwith a vain clutch at the iron deck, a wild throwing up of the arms,\r\nwent down, their death-cry ringing in the ears of their companions.\r\n\r\n17. The boat sometimes held her place by the "Monitor\'s" side, then was\r\ndashed hopelessly out of reach, rising and falling on the waves. A\r\nsailor would spring from the deck to reach her, to be seen for a moment\r\nin mid-air, and then, as she rose, fall into her. So she gradually\r\nfilled up; but some poor souls who sought to reach her, failed, even as\r\nthey touched her receding sides, and went down. We had a little\r\nmessenger-boy, the special charge of one of our sailors, and the pet of\r\nall; he must inevitably have been lost, but for the care of his adopted\r\nfather, who, holding him firmly in his arms, escaped, as by a miracle,\r\nbeing washed overboard, but finally succeeded in placing him safely in\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\n18. The last but one to make the desperate venture, was the surgeon; he\r\nleaped from the deck, at the very instant when the boat was being swept\r\naway by the merciless sea. Making one final effort, he threw his body\r\nforward as he fell, striking across the boat\'s side so violently, it was\r\nthought some of his ribs must be broken. "_Haul the Doctor in!_" shouted\r\nLieutenant Greene, perhaps remembering how, a little time back, he\r\nhimself, almost gone down in the unknown sea, had been "hauled in" by a\r\nquinine rope flung him by the Doctor. Stout sailor-arms pulled him in;\r\none more sprang to a place in her, and the boat, now full, pushed\r\noff,--in a sinking condition, it is true, but still bearing hope with\r\nher, for _she was wood_.\r\n\r\n19. Over the waves we made little progress, though pulling for life. The\r\nmen stuffed their pea-jackets into the leaks, and bailed incessantly. We\r\nneared the "Rhode Island;" but now a new peril appeared. Eight down upon\r\nour center, borne by the might of the rushing water, came the whale-boat\r\nsent to rescue others from the iron-clad. We barely floated; if she\r\nstruck us with her bows full on us, we must go to the bottom. One\r\nsprang, and, as she neared, with outstretched arms, met and turned her\r\ncourse. She passed against us, and his hand, caught between the two\r\nboats, was crushed, and the arm, wrenched from its socket, fell a\r\nhelpless weight against his side; but life remained. We were saved, and\r\nan arm was a small price to pay for life.\r\n\r\n20. We reached the "Rhode Island;" ropes were flung over her side, and\r\ncaught with a death-grip. Some lost their hold, were washed away, and\r\nagain dragged in by the boat\'s crew. What chance had one whose right arm\r\nhung a dead weight, when strong men with their two hands, went down\r\nbefore him? He caught at a rope, found it impossible to save himself\r\nalone, and then for the first time said,--"I am injured; can any one\r\nhelp me?" Ensign Taylor, at the risk of his own life, brought the rope\r\naround his shoulder in such a way that it could not slip, and he was\r\ndrawn up in safety.\r\n\r\n21. In the mean time, the whale-boat, which had nearly caused our\r\ndestruction, had reached the side of the "Monitor;" and now the captain\r\nsaid, "It is madness to remain here longer: let each man save himself."\r\nFor a moment, he descended to the cabin for a coat, and his faithful\r\nservant followed to secure a jewel-box, containing the accumulated\r\ntreasure of years. A sad, sorry sight it was! In the heavy air the lamps\r\nburned dimly, and the water, waist-deep, splashed sullenly against the\r\nsides of the wardroom. One lingering look, and he left the "Monitor\'s"\r\ncabin forever!\r\n\r\n22. Time was precious; he hastened to the deck, where, in the midst of a\r\nterrible sea, Lieutenant Greene nobly held his post. He seized the rope\r\nfrom the whale-boat, wound it about an iron stanchion, then around his\r\nwrists, and, by this means, was drawn aboard the boat. Thus, one by one,\r\nwatching their time between the waves, the men filled in, and, at last,\r\nafter making all effort for others, and none for themselves, Captain\r\nBankhead and Lieutenant Greene took their places in the boat The gallant\r\nBrown pushed off, and soon laid his boat-load safe upon the "Rhode\r\nIsland\'s" deck.\r\n\r\n23. Here the heartiest and most tender reception met us. Our drenched\r\nclothing was replaced by warm and dry garments, and all on board vied\r\nwith each other in acts of kindness. The only one who had received any\r\ninjury, Surgeon Weeks, [Footnote: The writer of this account.] was\r\ncarefully attended to, the dislocated arm set, and the crushed fingers\r\namputated, by the gentlest and most considerate of surgeons, Dr. Webber,\r\nof the "Rhode Island."\r\n\r\n24. For an hour or more we watched, from the deck of the steamer, the\r\nlonely light upon the "Monitor\'s" turrets; a hundred times we thought it\r\ngone forever,--a hundred times it reappeared, till, at last, about two\r\no\'clock, Wednesday morning, December 31st, it sank, and we saw it no\r\nmore. An actor in the scenes of that wild night, when the "Monitor" went\r\ndown, relates the story of her last cruise. _Her_ work is now over. She\r\nlies a hundred fathoms deep under the stormy-waters off Cape Hatteras;\r\nbut she has made herself a name, which will not soon be forgotten by the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

Oh, if this latent power could be aroused! If woman would shake off\r\nthis slumber, and put on her strength, her beautiful garments, how would\r\nshe go forth conquering and to conquer! How would the mountains break\r\nforth into singing, and the trees of the field clap their hands! How\r\nwould our sin-stained earth arise and shine, her light being come, and\r\nthe glory of the Lord being risen upon her!\r\n\r\n2. One can not do the _world\'s_ work; but one can do _one\'s_ work. You\r\nmay not be able to turn the world from iniquity; but you can, at least,\r\nkeep the dust and rust from gathering on your own soul. If you can not\r\nbe directly and actively engaged in fighting the battle, you can, at\r\nleast, polish your armor and sharpen your weapons, to strike an\r\neffective blow when the hour comes. You can stanch the blood of him who\r\nhas been wounded in the fray,--bear a cup of cold water to the thirsty\r\nand fainting,--give help to the conquered, and smiles to the victor.\r\n\r\n3. You can gather from the past and the present stores of wisdom, so\r\nthat, when the future demands it, you may bring forth from your\r\ntreasures things new and old. Whatever of bliss the "Divinity that\r\nshapes our ends" may see fit to withhold from you, you are but very\r\nlittle lower than the angels, so long as you have the\r\n\r\n  "Godlike power to do,--the godlike aim to know."\r\n\r\n4. You can be forming habits of self-reliance, sound judgment,\r\nperseverance, and endurance, which may, one day, stand you in good\r\nstead. You can so train yourself to right thinking and right acting,\r\nthat uprightness shall be your nature, truth your impulse. His head is\r\nseldom far wrong, whose heart is always right. We bow down to mental\r\ngreatness, intellectual strength, and they are divine gifts; but _moral\r\nrectitude_ is stronger than they. It is irresistible,--always in the\r\nend triumphant.\r\n\r\n5. There is in _goodness_ a penetrative power that nothing can\r\nwithstand. Cunning and malice melt away before its mild, open, steady\r\nglance. Not alone on the fields where chivalry charges for laurels, with\r\nhelmet and breastplate and lance in rest, can the true knight exultingly\r\nexclaim,\r\n\r\n  "My strength is as the strength of ten,\r\n   Because my heart is pure;"\r\n\r\nbut wherever man meets man, wherever there is a prize to be won, a goal\r\nto be reached. Wealth, and rank, and beauty, may form a brilliant\r\nsetting to the diamond; but they only expose more nakedly the false\r\nglare of the paste. Only when the king\'s daughter is all glorious\r\nwithin, is it fitting and proper that her clothing should be of wrought\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n6. From the great and good of all ages rings out the same monotone. The\r\nhigh-priest of Nature, the calm-eyed poet who laid his heart so close to\r\nhers, that they seemed to throb in one pulsation, yet whose ear was\r\nalways open to the "still sad music of humanity," has given us the\r\npromise of his life-long wisdom in these grand words:--\r\n\r\n  "True dignity abides with him alone\r\n   Who, in the silent hour of inward thought,\r\n   Can still suspect and still revere himself."\r\n\r\n7. Through the din of twenty rolling centuries, pierces the sharp, stern\r\nvoice of the brave old Greek: "_Let every man, when he is about to do a\r\nwicked action, above all things in the world, stand in awe of himself,\r\nand dread the witness within him._" All greatness, and all glory, all\r\nthat earth has to give, all that Heaven can proffer, lies within the\r\nreach of the lowliest as well as the highest; for He who spake as never\r\nman spake, has said that the very "kingdom of God is within you."\r\n\r\n8. Born to such an inheritance, will you wantonly cast it away? With\r\nsuch a goal in prospect, will you suffer yourself to be turned aside by\r\nthe sheen and shimmer of tinsel fruit? With earth in possession, and\r\nHeaven in reversion, will you go sorrowing and downcast, because here\r\nand there a pearl or ruby fails you? Nay, rather forgetting those things\r\nwhich are behind, and reaching forth unto those which are before, _press\r\nforward_!\r\n\r\n9. Discontent and murmuring are insidious foes; trample them under your\r\nfeet. Utter no complaint, whatever betide; for complaining is a sign of\r\nweakness. If your trouble can be helped, _help it_; if not, _bear it_.\r\nYou can be whatever you _will_ to be. Therefore, form and accomplish\r\nworthy purposes.\r\n\r\n10. If you walk alone, let it be with no faltering tread. Show to an\r\nincredulous world\r\n\r\n  "How grand may be Life\'s might,\r\n   Without Love\'s circling crown."\r\n\r\nOr, if the golden thread of love shine athwart the dusky warp of duty,\r\nif other hearts depend on yours for sustenance and strength, give to\r\nthem from your fullness no stinted measure. Let the dew of your kindness\r\nfall on the evil and the good, on the just and on the unjust.\r\n\r\n11. Compass happiness, since happiness alone is victory. On the\r\nfragments of your shattered plans, and hopes, and love,--on the\r\nheaped-up ruins of your past, rear a stately palace, whose top shall\r\nreach unto heaven, whose beauty shall gladden the eyes of all beholders,\r\nwhose doors shall stand wide open to receive the way-worn and weary.\r\nLife is a burden, but it is imposed by God. What you _make_ of it, it\r\nwill _be_ to you, whether a millstone about your neck, or a diadem upon\r\nyour brow. _Take it up bravely, bear it on joyfully, lay it down\r\ntriumphantly._\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

So goes the world`;--if wealthy, you may call\r\n   _This_--friend, _that_--brother`;--friends and brothers all\r\n     Though you are worthless, witless,--never mind it;\r\n   You may have been a stable-boy,--what then?\r\n   \'Tis _wealth_, my friends, makes _honorable_ men.\r\n     You seek respect, no doubt, and you will find it.\r\n\r\n2. But, if you are poor\', heaven help you`! though your sire\r\n   Had royal blood in him`, and though you\r\n   Possess the intellect of angels too.\r\n   \'Tis all in vain`;--the world will ne\'er inquire\r\n   On such a score`:--why should it take the pains?\r\n  \'Tis easier to weigh purses`, sure, than brains\'.\r\n\r\n3. I once saw a poor fellow, keen and clever.\r\n   Witty and wise`; he paid a man a visit,\r\n   And no one noticed him\', and no one ever\r\n   Gave him a welcome`. "Strange`," cried I\', "whence is it`?"\r\n       He walked on this side\', then on that`,\r\n       He tried to introduce a social chat`;\r\n   Now here\', now there`, in vain he tried`;\r\n   Some formally and freezingly replied,\r\n   And some said by their silence,--"Better stay at home."\r\n\r\n4.     A rich man burst the door,\r\n       As Croesus [Headnote 1] rich;--I\'m sure\r\n   He could not pride himself upon his wit`;\r\n   And, as for wisdom, he had none of it`;\r\n   He had what\'s better`,--he had wealth.\r\n       What a confusion!--all stand up erect,--\r\n   These crowd around to ask him of his health;\r\n       These bow in _honest_ duty and respect;\r\n   And these arrange a sofa or a chair,\r\n   And these conduct him there.\r\n   "Allow me, sir, the honor`;"--Then a bow\r\n   Down to the earth`.--_Is\'t_ possible to show\r\n   Meet gratitude for such kind condescension`!\r\n\r\n5.     The poor man hung his head,\r\n       And to himself he said,\r\n   "This is indeed beyond my comprehension:"\r\n   Then looking round, one friendly face he found,\r\n   And said,--"Pray tell me why is wealth preferred\r\n   "To wisdom?"--"That\'s a silly question, friend!"\r\n   Replied the other,--"have you never heard.\r\n       A man may lend his store\r\n       Of gold or silver ore,\r\n   But wisdom none can borrow, none can lend?"\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

The most fearful and impressive exhibitions of power known to our\r\nglobe, belong to the ocean. The volcano, with its ascending flame and\r\nfalling torrents of fire, and the earthquake, whose footstep is on the\r\nruin of cities, are circumscribed in the desolating range of their\r\nvisitations. But the ocean, when it once rouses itself in its chainless\r\nstrength, shakes a thousand shores with its storm and thunder. Navies of\r\noak and iron are tossed in mockery from its crest, and armaments, manned\r\nby the strength and courage of millions, perish among its bubbles.\r\n\r\n2. The avalanche, shaken from its glittering steep, if it rolls to the\r\nbosom of the earth, melts away, and is lost in vapor; but if it plunge\r\ninto the embrace of the ocean, this mountain mass of ice and hail is\r\nborne about for ages in tumult and terror; it is the drifting monument\r\nof the ocean\'s dead. The tempest on land is impeded by forests, and\r\nbroken by mountains; but on the plain of the deep it rushes unresisted;\r\nand when its strength is at last spent, ten thousand giant waves still\r\nroll its terrors onward.\r\n\r\n3. The mountain lake and the meadow stream are inhabited only by the\r\ntimid prey of the angler; but the ocean is the home of the\r\nleviathan,--his ways are in the mighty deep. The glittering pebble and\r\nthe rainbow-tinted shell, which the returning tide has left on the\r\nshore, and the watery gem which the pearl-diver reaches at the peril of\r\nhis life, are all that man can filch from the treasures of the sea. The\r\ngroves of coral which wave over its pavements, and the halls of amber\r\nwhich glow in its depths, are beyond his approaches, save when he goes\r\ndown there to seek, amid their silent magnificence, his burial monument.\r\n\r\n4. The islands, the continents, the shores of civilized and savage\r\nrealms, the capitals of kings, are worn by time, washed away by the\r\nwave, consumed by the flame, or sunk by the earthquake; but the ocean\r\nstill remains, and still rolls on in the greatness of its unabated\r\nstrength. Over the majesty of its form and the marvel of its might, time\r\nand disaster have no power. Such as creation\'s dawn beheld, it rolleth\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n5. The vast clouds of vapor which roll up from its bosom, float away to\r\nencircle the globe: on distant mountains and deserts they pour out their\r\nwatery treasures, which gather themselves again in streams and torrents,\r\nto return, with exulting bounds, to their parent ocean. These are the\r\nmessengers which proclaim in every land the exhaustless resources of the\r\nsea; but it is reserved for those who go down in ships, and who do\r\nbusiness in the great waters, to see the works of the Lord and His\r\nwonders in the deep.\r\n\r\n6. Let one go upon deck in the middle watch of a still night, with\r\nnaught above him but the silent and solemn skies, and naught around and\r\nbeneath him but an interminable waste of waters, and with the conviction\r\nthat there is but a plank between him and eternity, a feeling of\r\nloneliness, solitude, and desertion, mingled with a sentiment of\r\nreverence for the vast, mysterious and unknown, will come upon him with\r\na power, all unknown before, and he might stand for hours entranced in\r\nreverence and tears.\r\n\r\n7. Man, also, has made the ocean the theater of _his_ power. The ship in\r\nwhich he rides that element, is one of the highest triumphs of his\r\nskill. At first, this floating fabric was only a frail bark, slowly\r\nurged by the laboring oar. The sail, at length, arose and spread its\r\nwings to the wind. Still he had no power to direct his course when the\r\nlofty promontory sunk from sight, or the orbs above him were lost in\r\nclouds. But the secret of the magnet is, at length, revealed to him, and\r\nhis needle now settles, with a fixedness which love has stolen as the\r\nsymbol of its constancy, to the polar star.\r\n\r\n8. Now, however, he can dispense even with sail, and wind, and flowing\r\nwave. He constructs and propels his vast engines of flame and vapor,\r\nand, through the solitude of the sea, as over the solid land, goes\r\nthundering on his track. On the ocean, too, thrones have been lost and\r\nwon. On the fate of Actium [Headnote 1] was suspended the empire of the\r\nworld. In the gulf of Salamis,[Headnote 2] the pride of Persia found a\r\ngrave; and the crescent set forever in the waters of Navarino;[Headnote\r\n3] while, at Trafalgar [Headnote 4] and the Nile, nations held their\r\nbreath,\r\n\r\n        As each gun,\r\n  From its adamantine lips,\r\n  Spread a death-shade round the ships\r\n  Like the hurricane\'s eclipse\r\n        Of the sun.\r\n\r\n9. But, of all the wonders appertaining to the ocean, the greatest,\r\nperhaps, is its transforming power on man. It unravels and weaves anew\r\nthe web of his moral and social being. It invests him with feelings,\r\nassociations, and habits, to which he has been an entire stranger. It\r\nbreaks up the sealed fountain of his nature, and lifts his soul into\r\nfeatures prominent as the cliffs which beetle over its surge.\r\n\r\n10. Once the adopted child of the ocean, he can never bring back his\r\nentire sympathies to land. He will still move in his dreams over that\r\nvast waste of waters, still bound in exultation and triumph through its\r\nfoaming billows. All the other realities of life will be comparatively\r\ntame, and he will sigh for his tossing element, as the caged eagle for\r\nthe roar and arrowy light of his mountain cataract.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

Death is a fearful thing, come in what form it may,--fearful, when\r\nthe vital chords are so gradually relaxed, that life passes away sweetly\r\nas music from the slumbering harp-string,--fearful, when in his own\r\nquiet chamber, the departing one is summoned by those who sweetly follow\r\nhim with their prayers, when the assiduities of friendship and affection\r\ncan go no farther, and who discourse of heaven and future blessedness,\r\ntill the closing ear can no longer catch the tones of the long-familiar\r\nvoice, and who, lingering near, still feel for the hushed pulse, and\r\nthen trace in the placid slumber, which pervades each feature, a quiet\r\nemblem of the spirit\'s serene repose.\r\n\r\n2. What, then, must this dread event be to one, who meets it\r\ncomparatively alone, far away from the hearth of his home, upon a\r\ntroubled sea, between the narrow decks of a restless ship, and at that\r\ndread hour of night, when even the sympathies of the world seem\r\nsuspended! Such has been the end of many who traverse the ocean; and\r\nsuch was the hurried end of him, whose remains we have just consigned to\r\na watery grave.\r\n\r\n3. He was a sailor; but, beneath his rude exterior, he carried a heart\r\ntouched with refinement, pride, and greatness. There was something about\r\nhim, which spoke of better days and a higher destiny. By what errors or\r\nmisfortunes he was reduced to his humble condition, was a secret which\r\nhe would reveal to none. Silent, reserved, and thoughtful, he stood a\r\nstranger among his free companions, and never was his voice heard in the\r\nlaughter or the jest. He has undoubtedly left behind many who will long\r\nlook for his return, and bitterly weep when they are told they shall see\r\nhis face no more.\r\n\r\n4. As the remains of the poor sailor were brought up on deck, wound in\r\nthat hammock which, through many a stormy night, had swung to the wind,\r\none could not but observe the big tear that stole unconsciously down the\r\nrough cheeks of his hardy companions. When the funeral service was read\r\nto that most affecting passage, "we commit this body to the deep," and\r\nthe plank was raised which precipitated to the momentary eddy of the\r\nwave the quickly disappearing form, a heavy sigh from those around, told\r\nthat the strong heart of the sailor can be touched with grief, and that\r\na truly unaffected sorrow may accompany virtue, in its most unpretending\r\nform, to its ocean grave. Yet how soon is such a scene forgotten!\r\n\r\n  "As from the wing the sky no scar retains,\r\n   The parted wave no furrow from the keel,\r\n   So dies in human hearts the thought of death."\r\n\r\n5. There is something peculiarly melancholy and impressive in a burial\r\nat sea: there is here no coffin or hearse, procession or tolling\r\nbell,--nothing that gradually prepares us for the final separation. The\r\nbody is wound in the drapery of its couch, much as if the deceased were\r\nonly in a quiet and temporary sleep. In these habiliments of seeming\r\nslumber, it is dropped into the wave, the waters close over it, the\r\nvessel passes quickly on, and not a solitary trace is left to tell where\r\nsunk from light and life, one that loved to look at the sky and breathe\r\nthis vital air.\r\n\r\n6. There is nothing that, for one moment, can point to the deep,\r\nunvisited resting-place of the departed,--it is a grave in the midst of\r\nthe ocean,--in the midst of a vast, untrodden solitude. Affection can\r\nnot approach it, with its tears; the dews of heaven can not reach it;\r\nand there is around it no violet, or shrub, or murmuring stream.\r\n\r\n7. It may be superstitious; but no advantages of wealth, or honor, or\r\npower, through life, would reconcile me at its close to such a burial. I\r\nwould rather share the coarse and scanty provisions of the simplest\r\ncabin, and drop away unknown and unhonored by the world, so that my\r\nfinal resting-place be beneath some green tree, by the side of some\r\nliving stream, or in some familiar spot, where the few that loved me in\r\nlife, might visit me in death.\r\n\r\n8. But, whether our grave be in the fragrant shade, or in the fathomless\r\nocean, among our kindred, or in the midst of strangers, the day is\r\ncoming when we shall all appear at one universal bar, and receive from a\r\nrighteous Judge the award of our deeds. He that is wisest, penetrates\r\nthe future the deepest.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. What is said of death? 2. What, of death at sea?\r\n3.

RITCHIE.\r\n\r\n1. At this moment, we drew near the rude wharf at Mount Vernon; the boat\r\nstopped, and the crowd of passengers landed. By a narrow pathway we\r\nascended a majestic hill thickly draped with trees. The sun scarcely\r\nfound its way through the luxuriant foliage. We mounted slowly, but had\r\nonly spent a few minutes in ascending, when we came suddenly upon a\r\npicturesque nook, where a cluster of unostentatious, white marble\r\nshafts, shot from the greenly sodded earth, inclosed by iron railings.\r\nThose unpretending monuments mark the localities where repose the mortal\r\nremains of Washington\'s kindred.\r\n\r\n2. Just beyond stands a square brick building. In the center you see an\r\niron gate. Here the crowd pauses in reverential silence. Men lift their\r\nhats and women bow their heads. You behold within, two sarcophagi.\r\n[Headnote 1] In those moldering tombs lie the ashes of the great\r\nWashington and his wife. Not a word is uttered as the crowd stand\r\ngazing on this lowly receptacle of the dust of America\'s mighty dead.\r\n\r\n3. Are there any in that group who can say, "this was _our_ country\'s\r\nfather\'?" If there be, can they stand pilgrims at that grave without\r\nWashington\'s examples, his counsels, his words, heretofore, it may be,\r\nhalf-forgotten, stealing back into their minds, until the sense of\r\nreverence and gratitude is deepened almost to awe? Do they not feel that\r\nWashington\'s spirit is abroad in the world, filling the souls of a\r\nheaven-favored people with the love of freedom and of country, though\r\nhis ashes are gathered here\'?\r\n\r\n4. Some one moves to pass on; and, with that first step, the spell is\r\nbroken; others follow. Herman and Jessie linger last. After a period of\r\nmute and moving reflection, they turn away and slowly approach the\r\nmansion that, in simple, rural stateliness, stands upon a noble\r\npromontory, belted with woods, and half-girdled by the sparkling waters\r\nof the Potomac, which flow in a semicircle around a portion of the\r\nmount.\r\n\r\n5. The water and woodland view from the portico is highly imposing. But\r\nit was not the mere recognition of the picturesque and beautiful in\r\nnature, that moved Herman and Jessie. They would have felt that they\r\nwere on holy ground, had the landscape been devoid of natural charm.\r\nHere the feet of the first of heroes had trod, and here, in boyhood, he\r\nhad sported with his beloved brother Lawrence.\r\n\r\n6. In those forests, those deep-wooded glens, he had hunted, when a\r\nstripling, by the side of old Lord Fairfax; here he took his first\r\nlessons in the art of war; to this home he brought his bride; by this\r\nold-fashioned, hospitable-looking fireside, he sat with that dear and\r\nfaithful wife; beneath yonder alley of lofty trees he has often wandered\r\nby her side; here he indulged the agricultural tastes in which he\r\ndelighted; here resigned his Cincinnatus vocation, and bade adieu to his\r\ncherished home at the summons of his country.\r\n\r\n7. Here his wife received the letter which told her that he had been\r\nappointed Commander-in-chief of the army; here, when the glorious\r\nstruggle closed at the trumpet notes of victory--when the British had\r\nretired--when, with tears coursing down his benignant, manly\r\ncountenance, he had uttered a touching farewell--bestowed a paternal\r\nbenediction on the American army, and resigned all public service--\r\n_here_ he returned, thinking to resume the rural pursuits that charmed\r\nhim, and to end his days in peace!\r\n\r\n8. Here are the trees, the shrubbery he planted with his own hands, and\r\nnoted in his diary; here are the columns of the portico round which he\r\ntwined the coral honeysuckle; the ivy he transplanted still clings to\r\nyonder garden wall; these vistas he opened through yon pine groves to\r\ncommand far-off views! Here the valiant Lafayette sojourned with him;\r\nthere hangs the key of the Bastile [Headnote 2] which he presented.\r\n\r\n9. Here flocked the illustrious men of all climes, and were received\r\nwith warm, unpretending, almost rustic hospitality. Here the French\r\nHoudon modeled his statue, and the English Pine painted his portrait,\r\nand caused that jocose remark, "I am so hackneyed to the touches of the\r\npainters\' pencil, that I am altogether at their beck, and sit like\r\n\'Patience on a monument!\'"\r\n\r\n10. Then came another summons from the land he had saved, and he was\r\nchosen by unanimous voice its chief ruler. Thousands of men, women, and\r\nchildren, sent up acclamations, and called down blessings on his head,\r\nas he made his triumphal progress from Mount Vernon to New York, to take\r\nthe presidential oath. The roar of cannon rent the air. The streets\r\nthrough which he passed, were illuminated and decked with flags and\r\nwreaths. Bonfires blazed on the hills. From ships and boats floated\r\nfestive decorations. At Gray\'s Ferry, he passed under triumphal arches.\r\n\r\n11. On the bridge across the Assumpink, at Trenton, (the very bridge\r\nover which he had retreated in such blank despair, before the army of\r\nCornwallis, on the eve of the battle of Princeton,) thirteen pillars,\r\ntwined with laurel and evergreens, were reared by woman\'s hands. The\r\nforemost of the arches those columns supported, bore the inscription,\r\n_"The Defender of the Mothers will he the Protector of the Daughters."_\r\nMothers, with their white-robed daughters, were assembled beneath the\r\nvernal arcade. Thirteen maidens scattered flowers beneath his feet, as\r\nthey sang an ode of gratulation. The people\'s hero ever after spoke of\r\nthis tribute, as the one that touched him most deeply.\r\n\r\n13. When his first presidential term expired, and his heart yearned for\r\nthe peace of his domestic hearth, the entreaties of Jefferson, Randolph,\r\nand Hamilton, forced him to forget that home for the one he held in the\r\nhearts of patriots, and to allow his name to be used a second time. A\r\nsecond time he was unanimously elected to preside over his country\'s\r\nwelfare. But, the period happily expired, he thankfully laid aside the\r\nmantle of state, the scepter of power, and, five days after the\r\ninauguration of Adams, returned here to his Mount Vernon home. And here\r\nthe good servant, whom his Lord, when He came, found watching and ready,\r\ncalmly yielded up his breath, exclaiming, "It is well!" and his spirit\r\nwas wafted to Heaven by the blessings of his enfranchised countrymen.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

While we bring our offerings for the mighty of our _own_ land, shall\r\nwe not remember the chivalrous spirits of _other_ shores, who shared\r\nwith them the hour of weakness and woe\'? Pile to the clouds the majestic\r\ncolumn of glory`; let the lips of those who can speak well, hallow each\r\nspot where the bones of your bold repose`; but forget not those who,\r\nwith your bold, went out to battle.\r\n\r\n2. Among those men of noble daring, there was _one_, a young and gallant\r\nstranger, who left the blushing vine-hills of his delightful France. The\r\npeople whom he came to succor, were not _his_ people; he knew them only\r\nin the melancholy story of their wrongs. He was no mercenary adventurer,\r\nstriving for the spoil of the vanquished; the palace acknowledged him\r\nfor its lord, and the valley yielded him its increase. He was no\r\nnameless man, staking life for reputation; he ranked among nobles, and\r\nlooked unawed upon kings.\r\n\r\n3. He was no friendless outcast, seeking for a grave to hide a broken\r\nheart; he was girdled by the companions of his childhood; his kinsmen\r\nwere about him; his wife was before him. Yet from all these loved ones\r\nhe turned away. Like a lofty tree that shakes down its green glories, to\r\nbattle with the winter storm, he flung aside the trappings of place and\r\npride, to crusade for Freedom, in Freedom\'s holy land. He came`; but not\r\nin the day of successful rebellion\', not when the new-risen sun of\r\nIndependence had burst the cloud of time, and careered to its place in\r\nthe heavens\'.\r\n\r\n4. He came when darkness curtained the hills, and the tempest was abroad\r\nin its anger`; when the plow stood still in the field of promise, and\r\nbriers cumbered the garden of beauty`; when fathers were dying, and\r\nmothers were weeping over them`; when the wife was binding up the gashed\r\nbosom of her husband, and the maiden was wiping the death-damp from the\r\nbrow of her lover`. He came when the brave began to fear the power of\r\nman, and the pious to doubt the favor of God. It was _then_ that this\r\none joined the ranks of a revolted people.\r\n\r\n5. Freedom\'s little phalanx bade him a grateful welcome. With them he\r\ncourted the battle\'s rage; with theirs, his arm was lifted; with theirs,\r\nhis blood was shed. Long and doubtful was the conflict. At length, kind\r\nHeaven smiled on the good cause, and the beaten invaders fled. The\r\nprofane were driven from the temple of Liberty, and, at her pure shrine,\r\nthe pilgrim-warrior, with his adored commander, knelt and worshiped.\r\nLeaving there his offering, the incense of an uncorrupted spirit, he at\r\nlength rose, and, crowned with benedictions, turned his happy feet\r\ntoward his long-deserted home.\r\n\r\n6. After nearly fifty years, that _one_ has come again. Can mortal\r\ntongue tell? can mortal heart feel, the sublimity of that coming?\r\nExulting millions rejoice in it; and their loud, long, transporting\r\nshout, like the mingling of many winds, rolls on, undying, to Freedom\'s\r\nfarthest mountains. A congregated nation comes around him. Old men bless\r\nhim, and children reverence him. The lovely come out to look upon him;\r\nthe learned deck their halls to greet him; the rulers of the land rise\r\nup to do him homage.\r\n\r\n7. How his full heart labors! He views the rusting trophies of departed\r\ndays; he treads the high places where his brethren molder; he bends\r\nbefore the tomb of his "father;" [Footnote: Washington] his words are\r\ntears,--the speech of sad remembrance. But he looks round upon a\r\nransomed land and a joyous race; he beholds the blessings these trophies\r\nsecured, for which these brethren died, for which that "father" lived;\r\nand again his words are tears,--the eloquence of gratitude and joy.\r\n\r\n8. Spread forth creation like a map; bid earth\'s dead multitudes revive;\r\nand of all the pageant splendors that ever glittered to the sun, when\r\nlooked his burning eye on a sight like this? Of all the myriads that\r\nhave come and gone, what cherished minion ever ruled an hour like this?\r\nMany have struck the redeeming blow for their own freedom; but who, like\r\nthis man, has bared his bosom in the cause of strangers?\r\n\r\n9. Others have lived in the love of their own people; but who, like this\r\nman, has drank his sweetest cup of welcome with another? Matchless\r\nchief! of glory\'s immortal tablets there is one for him, for _him_\r\nalone! Oblivion shall never shroud its splendor; the everlasting flame\r\nof Liberty shall guard it, that the generations of men may repeat the\r\nname recorded there, the beloved name of LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

DR. HARBAUGH.\r\n\r\n 1. Weaver at his loom is sitting,\r\n      Throws his shuttle to and fro;\r\n          Foot and treadle,\r\n          Hand and pedal,\r\n          Upward, downward,\r\n          Hither, thither,\r\n    How the weaver makes them go!\r\n    As the weaver _wills_ they go.\r\n    Up and down the web is plying,\r\n    And across the woof is flying;\r\n          What a rattling!\r\n          What a battling!\r\n          What a shuffling!\r\n          What a scuffling!\r\n    As the weaver makes his shuttle,\r\n    Hither, thither, scud and scuttle.\r\n\r\n 2.       Threads in single,\r\n            Threads in double;\r\n          How they mingle!\r\n            What a trouble,\r\n          Every color!\r\n            What profusion!\r\n          Every motion--\r\n            What confusion!\r\n    While the web and woof are mingling,\r\n    Signal bells above are jingling,\r\n    Telling how each figure ranges,\r\n    Telling when the color changes,\r\n    As the weaver makes his shuttle,\r\n    Hither, thither, scud and scuttle.\r\n\r\n 3. Weaver at his loom is sitting,\r\n      Throws his shuttle to and fro;\r\n    \'Mid the noise and wild confusion,\r\n      Well the weaver seems to know,\r\n      As he makes his shuttle go,\r\n          What each motion,\r\n          And commotion,\r\n          What each fusion,\r\n          And confusion,\r\n      In the _grand result_ will show:\r\n          Weaving daily,\r\n          Singing gayly,\r\n    As he makes his busy shuttle,\r\n    Hither, thither, scud and scuttle.\r\n\r\n 4. Weaver at his loom is sitting,\r\n      Throws his shuttle to and fro;\r\n    See you not how shape and order\r\n      From the wild confusion grow,\r\n        As he makes his shuttle go\'?\r\n    As the web and woof diminish,\r\n    Grows beyond the beauteous finish:\r\n          Tufted plaidings,\r\n          Shapes and shadings,\r\n          All the mystery\r\n          Now is history:\r\n    And we see the reason subtle,\r\n    Why the weaver makes his shuttle,\r\n    Hither, thither, scud and scuttle.\r\n\r\n 5. See the Mystic Weaver sitting,\r\n      High in Heaven--His loom below.\r\n      Up and down the treadles go:\r\n    Takes for web the world\'s long ages,\r\n    Takes for woof its kings and sages,\r\n    Takes the nobles and their pages,\r\n    Takes all stations and all stages.\r\n      Thrones are bobbins in His shuttle;\r\n      Armies make them scud and scuttle.\r\n\r\n 6. Web into the woof must flow,\r\n    Up and down the nations go,\r\n    As the Weaver _wills_ they go.\r\n          Men are sparring,\r\n          Powers are jarring,\r\n          Upward, downward,\r\n          Hither, thither,\r\n    See how strange the nations go,\r\n    Just like puppets in a show.\r\n    Up and down the web is plying\r\n    And across the woof is flying.\r\n          What a rattling!\r\n          What a battling!\r\n          What a shuffling!\r\n          What a scuffling!\r\n    As the Weaver makes His shuttle\r\n    Hither, thither, scud and scuttle.\r\n\r\n 7. Calmly see the Mystic Weaver,\r\n      Throw His shuttle to and fro;\r\n    \'Mid the noise and wild confusion,\r\n      Well the Weaver seems to know\r\n          What each motion\r\n          And commotion,\r\n          What each fusion\r\n          And confusion,\r\n    In the grand result will show,\r\n          As the nations,\r\n          Kings and stations,\r\n          Upward, downward,\r\n          Hither, thither,\r\n    As in mystic dances, go.\r\n\r\n 8. In the Present all is mystery,\r\n    In the Past \'tis beauteous History.\r\n    O\'er the mixing and the mingling,\r\n    How the signal bells are jingling!\r\n    See you not the Weaver leaving\r\n    Finished work behind in weaving\'?\r\n      See you not the reason subtle,\r\n    As the web and woof diminish,\r\n    Changing into beauteous finish,\r\n      Why the Weaver makes His shuttle,\r\n      Hither, thither, scud and scuttle\'?\r\n\r\n 9. _Glorious wonder_!

Would not the\r\ncoming back be all up-hill\'? Could a ship accomplish it with even the\r\nmost favorable wind\'?\r\n\r\n_Columbus._ Will your majesty allow me to suggest that, if the earth is\r\na sphere, the same laws of adhesion and motion must operate at every\r\npoint on its surface; and the objection of Don Gomez would be quite as\r\nvalid against our being able to return from crossing the Strait of\r\nGibraltar.\r\n\r\n_Don G._ This gentleman, then, would have us believe the monstrous\r\nabsurdity, that there are people on the earth who are our\r\nantipodes,--who walk with their heads down, like flies on the ceiling.\r\n\r\n_Col._ But, your majesty, if there is a law of attraction which makes\r\nmatter gravitate to the earth, and prevents its flying off into space,\r\nmay not this law operate at every point on the round earth\'s surface\'?\r\n\r\n_Isa._ Truly, it so seems to me; and I perceive nothing absurd in the\r\nnotion that this earth is a globe floating or revolving in space.\r\n\r\n_Don G._ May it please your majesty, the ladies are privileged to give\r\ncredence to many wild tales which we plain matter-of-fact men can not\r\nadmit. Every step I take, confutes this visionary idea of the earth\'s\r\nrotundity. Would not the blood run into my head, if I were standing\r\nupside down! Were I not fearful of offending your majesty, I would quote\r\nwhat the great Lactantius [Headnote 2] says.\r\n\r\n_Isa_. We are not vain of our science, Don Gomez; so let us have the\r\nquotation.\r\n\r\n_Don G_. "Is there any one so foolish," he asks, "as to believe that\r\nthere are antipodes with their feet opposite to ours,--that there is a\r\npart of the world in which all things are topsy-turvy, where the trees\r\ngrow with their branches downward, and where it rains, hails, and snows,\r\nupward\'?"\r\n\r\n_Col_. I have already answered this objection. If there are people on\r\nthe earth who are our antipodes, it should be remembered that we are\r\ntheirs also.\r\n\r\n_Don G_. Really, that is the very point wherein we matter-of-fact men\r\nabide by the assurance of our own senses. We know that we are not\r\nwalking with our heads downward.\r\n\r\n_Isa_. To cut short the discussion, you think that the enterprise which\r\nthe Genoese proposes, is one unworthy of our serious consideration; and\r\nthat his theory of an unknown shore to the westward of us is a fallacy.\r\n\r\n_Don G_. As a plain matter-of-fact man, I must confess that I so regard\r\nit. Has your majesty ever seen an ambassador from this unknown coast?\r\n\r\n_Isa_. Don Gomez, do you believe in the existence of a world of spirits?\r\nHave you ever seen an ambassador from that unknown world?\r\n\r\n_Don G_. Certainly not. By faith we look forward to it.\r\n\r\n_Isa_. Even so by faith does the Genoese look forward, far over misty\r\nocean, to an undiscovered shore.\r\n\r\n_Col._ Your majesty is right; but let it be added that I have reasons,\r\noh! most potent and resistless reasons, for the faith that is in me: the\r\ntestimony of many navigators who have picked up articles that must have\r\ndrifted from this distant coast: the nature of things, admitting that\r\nthe earth is round: the reports current among the people of one of the\r\nnorthern nations, that many years ago their mariners had sailed many\r\nleagues westward till they reached a shore where the grape grew\r\nabundantly; these and other considerations have made it the fixed\r\npersuasion of my mind, that there is a great discovery reserved for the\r\nman who will sail patiently westward, trusting in God\'s good providence,\r\nand turning not back till he has achieved his purpose.\r\n\r\n_Don G._ Then truly we should never hear of him again. Speculation! mere\r\nspeculation, your majesty! When this gentleman can bring forward some\r\nsolid facts that will induce us plain matter-of-fact men to risk money\r\nin forwarding his enterprise, it will then be time enough for royalty to\r\ngive it heed. Why, your majesty, the very boys in the streets point at\r\ntheir foreheads as he passes along.\r\n\r\n_Isa._ And so you bring forward the frivolity of boys jeering at what\r\nthey do not comprehend, as an argument why Isabella should not give heed\r\nto this great and glorious scheme? Ay, sir, though it should fail,\r\nstill, it has been urged in language so intelligent and convincing, by\r\nthis grave and earnest man, whom you think to undervalue by calling him\r\nan adventurer, that I am resolved to test the "absurdity," as you style\r\nit, and that forthwith.\r\n\r\n_Don G._ Your majesty will excuse me if I remark, that I have from your\r\nroyal consort himself the assurance that the finances are so exhausted\r\nby the late wars, that he can not consent to advance the necessary funds\r\nfor fitting out an expedition of the kind proposed.\r\n\r\n_Isa._ Be _mine_, then, the privilege! I have jewels, by the pledging of\r\nwhich I can raise the amount required; and I have resolved that they\r\nshall be pledged to this enterprise, without any more delay.\r\n\r\n_Col._ Your majesty shall not repent your heroic resolve. I will return,\r\nyour majesty; be sure I will return, and lay at your feet such a jewel\r\nas never queen wore yet, an imperishable fame,--a fame that shall couple\r\nwith your memory the benedictions of millions yet unborn, in climes yet\r\nunknown to civilized man. There is an uplifting presentiment in my mind,\r\na conviction that your majesty will live to bless the hour you came to\r\nthis decision.\r\n\r\n_Don G._ A presentiment? A plain matter-of-fact man, like myself, must\r\ntake leave of your majesty, if his practical common-sense is to be met\r\nand superseded by presentiments! An ounce of fact, your majesty, is\r\nworth a ton of presentiment.\r\n\r\n_Isa._ That depends altogether upon the source of the presentiment, Don\r\nGomez. If it come from the Fountain of all truth, shall it not be good?\r\n\r\n_Don G._ I humbly take my leave of your majesty.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. What reasons did Don Gomez advance in proof that the\r\nearth is not a sphere? 2. What argument did Columbus present in proof\r\nthat it was? 3. What did Queen Isabella resolve to do?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLESSON CIII.\r\n\r\n   CON FIRM\' ING, corroborating.\r\n   AS SUR AN CES, assertions.\r\n   MU TI NEER\', one who resists orders.\r\n   IN FER\' RED, concluded.\r\n   CRAV\' ED, begged.\r\n   AS SO\' CIA TING, joining; connecting.\r\n   EX PEC TA\' TION, hope; a looking for.\r\n   VER\' I FIED, made true; realized.\r\n   PHOS PHO RES\' CENCE, faint light.\r\n   HES I TA\' TION, doubt.\r\n   EN JOIN\' ING, commanding; ordering.\r\n   AM PHI THE\' A TER, circular theater.\r\n   CON TR AST\' ED, set in opposition.\r\n   DE MEAN\' OR, behavior.\r\n   DE FAULT\', defect; absence.\r\n   IN SIG\' NIA, marks; signs.\r\n   IN I\' TIALS, first letters.\r\n   DEV AS TA TION, a laying waste.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE NEW WORLD.\r\n\r\nLAMARTINE.\r\n\r\n1. At sunrise, on the second day, some rashes recently torn up, were\r\nseen near the vessels. A plank, evidently hewn by an ax, a stick\r\nskillfully carved by some cutting instrument, a bough of hawthorn in\r\nblossom,--and lastly, a bird\'s nest built on a branch which the wind\r\nhad broken, and full of eggs, on which the parent bird was sitting amid\r\nthe gently-rolling waves,--were seen floating past on the waters. The\r\nsailors brought on board these living and inanimate witnesses of their\r\napproach to land. They were a voice from the shore, confirming the\r\nassurances of Columbus. Before the land actually appeared in sight, its\r\nneighborhood was inferred from these marks of life.\r\n\r\n2. The mutineers fell on their knees before the Admiral, whom they had\r\ninsulted but the day before, craved pardon for their mistrust, and\r\nstruck up a hymn of thanksgiving to God for associating them with this\r\ntriumph. Night fell on these songs welcoming a new world. The Admiral\r\ngave orders that the sails should be close-reefed, and the lead kept\r\ngoing; and that they should sail slowly, being afraid of breakers and\r\nshoals, and feeling certain that the first gleam of daybreak would\r\ndiscover land under their bows.\r\n\r\n3. On the last anxious night none slept. Impatient expectation had\r\nremoved all heaviness from their eyes; the pilots and the seamen,\r\nclinging about the masts, yards, and shrouds, each tried to keep the\r\nbest place and the closest watch to get the earliest sight of the new\r\nhemisphere. The Admiral had offered a reward to the first who should cry\r\n_Land_, provided his announcement was verified by its actual discovery.\r\n\r\n4. Providence, however, reserved to Columbus himself this first glimpse,\r\nwhich he had purchased at the expense of twenty years of his life, and\r\nof untiring perseverance. While walking the quarter-deck alone, at\r\nmidnight, and sweeping the dark horizon with his keen eye, a gleam of\r\nfire passed and disappeared, and again showed itself on the level of the\r\nwaves. Fearful of being deceived by the phosphorescence of the sea, he\r\nquietly called a Spanish gentleman of Isabella\'s court, in whom he had\r\nmore confidence than in the pilots, pointed out the direction in which\r\nhe had seen the light, and asked him whether he could discern any thing\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n5. He replied that he did, indeed, see a flickering light in that\r\nquarter. To make the fact still more sure, Columbus called another in\r\nwhom he had confidence to look in the same direction. He said he had no\r\nhesitation in pronouncing that there was a light on the horizon. But the\r\nblaze was hardly seen before it again disappeared in the ocean, to show\r\nitself anew the next moment. Whether it was the light of a fire on a low\r\nshore, alternately appearing and disappearing beyond the broken horizon,\r\nor whether it was the floating beacon of a fisherman\'s boat now rising\r\non the waves, and now sinking in the trough of the sea, they could not\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\n6. Thus both land and safety appeared together in the shape of fire to\r\nColumbus and his two friends, on the night between the 11th and 12th of\r\nOctober, 1492. The Admiral, enjoining silence, kept his observation to\r\nhimself, for fear of again raising false hopes, and giving a bitter\r\ndisappointment to his ships\' companies. He lost sight of the light, and\r\nremained on deck until two in the morning,--praying, hoping, and\r\ndespairing alone, awaiting the _triumph or the return_ on which the\r\nmorrow was to decide.\r\n\r\n7. He was seized with that anguish which precedes the great discoveries\r\nof truth, when, suddenly, a cannon-shot, sounding over the sea, a few\r\nhundred yards in advance of him, burst upon his ear the announcement of\r\na _new-born world_, which made him tremble, and fall upon his knees. It\r\nwas the signal of land in sight! made by firing a shot, as had been\r\narranged with the _Pinta_, which was sailing in advance of the squadron,\r\nto guide their course and take soundings.\r\n\r\n8. At this signal a general shout of _"Land ho!"_ arose from all the\r\nyards and riggings of the ships. The sails were furled, and daybreak was\r\nanxiously awaited. The mystery of the ocean had breathed its first\r\nwhisper in the bosom of night. Daybreak would clear it up openly to\r\nevery eye. Delicious and unknown perfumes reached the vessels from the\r\noutline of the shore, with the roar of the waves upon the reefs and the\r\nsoft land breeze.\r\n\r\n9. The fire seen by Columbus indicated the presence of man, and of the\r\nfirst element of civilization. Never did the night appear so long in\r\nclearing away from the horizon; for this horizon was to Columbus and his\r\ncompanions a second creation of God. The dawn, as it spread over the\r\nsky, gradually raised the shores of an island from the waves. Its\r\ndistant extremities were lost in the morning mist. It ascended\r\ngradually, like an amphitheater, from the low beach to the summit of the\r\nhills, whose dark-green covering contrasted strongly with the blue\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\n10. Within a few paces from where the foam of the waves breaks on the\r\nyellow sand, forests of tall and unknown trees stretched away, one above\r\nanother, over the successive terraces of the island. Green valleys and\r\nbright clefts in the hollows, afforded a half glimpse into these\r\nmysterious wilds. Here and there could be discovered a few scattered\r\nhuts, which, with their outlines and roofs of dry leaves, looked like\r\nbee-hives, and thin columns of blue smoke rose above the tops of the\r\ntrees. Half-naked groups of men, women, and children, more astonished\r\nthan frightened, appeared among the thickets near the shore, advancing\r\ntimidly, and then drawing back, exhibiting, by their gestures and\r\ndemeanor, as much fear as curiosity and wonder, at the sight of these\r\nstrange vessels, which the previous night had brought to their shores.\r\n\r\n11. Columbus, after gazing in silence on this foremost shore of the land\r\nso often determined by his calculations, and so magnificently colored by\r\nhis imagination, found it to exceed even his own expectations. He burned\r\nwith impatience to be the first European to set foot on the sand, and to\r\nplant the flag of Spain,--the standard of the conquest of God and of his\r\nsovereigns, effected by his genius. But he restrained the eagerness of\r\nhimself and of his crew to land, being desirous of giving to the act of\r\ntaking possession of a new world, a _solemnity_ worthy of the greatest\r\ndeed, perhaps, ever accomplished by a seaman; and, in default of men, to\r\ncall God and His angels, sea, earth, and sky, as witnesses of his\r\nconquest of an unknown hemisphere.\r\n\r\n12. He put on all the insignia of his dignities as Admiral of the Ocean,\r\nand the Viceroy of these future realms; he wrapped himself in his purple\r\ncloak, and taking in his hand an embroidered flag, in which the initials\r\nof Ferdinand and Isabella were interlaced, like their two kingdoms, and,\r\nsurmounted by a crown, he entered his boat, and pulled toward the shore,\r\nfollowed by the boats of his two lieutenants.\r\n\r\n13. On landing, he fell on his knees, to acknowledge, by this act of\r\nhumility and worship, the goodness and greatness of God in this new\r\nsphere of His works. He kissed the ground, and, with his face on the\r\nearth, he wept tears of double import, as they fell on the dust of this\r\nhemisphere, now, for the first time, visited by Europeans,--tears of joy\r\nfor the overflowing of a proud spirit, grateful and pious,--tears of\r\nsadness for this virgin soil, seeming to foreshadow the calamities, and\r\ndevastation, with fire and sword, and blood and destruction, which the\r\nstrangers were to bring with their pride, their knowledge, and their\r\npower.\r\n\r\n14. It was the _man_ that shed these tears; but it was the _earth_ that\r\nwas destined to weep. As Columbus raised his forehead from the dust,\r\nwith a Latin prayer, which his companions have handed down to us, he\r\nthus addressed the Sovereign Ruler of the world: (_sl_.) "Almighty and\r\neternal God, who, by the energy of thy creative word, hast made the\r\nfirmament, the earth, and sea, blessed and glorified be Thy name in all\r\nplaces! May Thy majesty and dominion be exalted forever and ever, as\r\nThou hast permitted Thy holy name to be made known and spread by the\r\nmost humble of Thy servants, in this hitherto unknown portion of Thy\r\nempire."\r\n\r\n15. He then gave to this land the name of San Salvador. His lieutenants,\r\nhis pilots, and his seamen, full of gladness, and impressed with a\r\nsuperstitious respect for him whose glance had pierced beyond the\r\nvisible horizon, and whom they had offended by their unbelief,--overcome\r\nby the evidence of their eyes, and by that mental superiority which\r\noverawes the minds of men,--fell at the feet of the Admiral, kissed his\r\nhands and his clothes, and recognized, for a moment, the power and the\r\nalmost divine nature of genius; _yesterday_ the victims of his\r\nobstinacy,--_now_ the companions of his success, and sharers in the\r\nglory which they had mocked. Such is humanity,--persecuting discoverers,\r\nyet reaping the fruits of their inventions.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. What evidences had Columbus that land was near? 2. What\r\ndid the mutineers do? 3.

WHAT! what is this you tell me? Columbus returned? A new\r\nworld discovered? Impossible!\r\n\r\n_Secretary_. It is even so, sir. A courier arrived at the palace but an\r\nhour since with the intelligence. Columbus was driven by stress of\r\nweather to anchor in the Tagus. All Portugal is in a ferment of\r\nenthusiasm, and all Spain will be equally excited soon. The sensation is\r\nprodigious!\r\n\r\n_Don G_. Oh, it is a trick! It must be a trick!\r\n\r\n_Sec_. But he has brought home the proofs of his visit,--gold and\r\nprecious stones, strange plants and animals; and, above all, specimens\r\nof a new race of men, copper-colored, with straight hair.\r\n\r\n_Don G_. Still I say, a trick! He has been coasting along the African\r\nshore, and there collected a few curiosities, which he is passing off\r\nfor proofs of his pretended discovery.\r\n\r\n_Sec_. It is a little singular that all his men should be leagued with\r\nhim in keeping up so unprofitable a falsehood.\r\n\r\n_Don G_. But \'tis against reason, against common sense, that such a\r\ndiscovery should be made.\r\n\r\n_Sec_. King John of Portugal has received him with royal magnificence,\r\nhas listened to his accounts, and is persuaded that they are true.\r\n\r\n_Don G._ We shall see, we shall see. Look you, sir, a plain\r\nmatter-of-fact man, such as I, is not to be taken in by any such\r\npreposterous story! This vaunted discovery will turn out no discovery at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n_Sec._ The king and queen have given orders for preparations on the most\r\nmagnificent scale for the reception of Columbus.\r\n\r\n_Don G._ What delusion! Her majesty is so credulous. A practical,\r\ncommon-sense man, like myself, can find no points of sympathy in her\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n_Sec._ The Indians on board the returned vessels, are said to be unlike\r\nany known race of men.\r\n\r\n_Don G._ Very unreliable all that! I take the common-sense view of the\r\nthing. I am a matter-of-fact man; and do you remember what I say, it\r\nwill all turn out a trick! The crews may have been deceived. Columbus\r\nmay have steered a southerly course, instead of a westerly. Any thing is\r\nprobable, rather than that a coast to the westward of us has been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n_Sec._ I saw the courier, who told me he had conversed with all the\r\nsailors; and they laughed at the suspicion that there could be any\r\nmistake about the discovery, or that any other than a westerly course\r\nhad been steered.\r\n\r\n_Don G._ Still I say, a trick! An unknown coast reached by steering\r\nwest? Impossible! The earth a globe, and men standing with their heads\r\ndown in space? Folly! An ignorant sailor from Genoa in the right, and\r\nall our learned doctors and philosophers in the wrong? _Nonsense!_ I\'m a\r\nmatter-of-fact man, sir. I will believe what I can see, and handle, and\r\nunderstand. But as for believing in the antipodes, or that the earth is\r\nround, or that Columbus has discovered land to the west,--Ring the\r\nbell, sir; call my carriage; I will go to the palace and undeceive the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLESSON CV.\r\n\r\n   HAR\' BIN GER, forerunner; precursor.\r\n   UN PIL\' LAR ED, unsupported by pillars.\r\n   UN YIELDING, stubborn.\r\n   DE CREES\', edicts; laws.\r\n   HAL\' LOW ED, sacred; consecrated.\r\n   MOLD\' ER ING, decaying.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO,\r\n\r\nGRENVILLE MULLEN.\r\n\r\n 1.

There are three forms of Nature, which especially command and elevate\r\nour souls, release her from her heavy clay and earthly limits, and send\r\nher, exulting, to sail amidst the wonders and mysteries of the Infinite.\r\n_First_, there is the unstable _Ocean of Air_ with its glorious banquet\r\nof light, its vapors, its twilight, and its shifting phantasmagoria of\r\ncapricious creatures, coming into existence only to depart the next\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n2. _Second_, there is the fixed _Ocean of the Earth_, its undulating and\r\nvast waves, as we see them from the tops of "the earth o\'er gazing\r\nmountains," the elevations which testify to antique mobility, and the\r\nsublimity of its mightier mountain-tops, clad in eternal snows. _Third_,\r\nthere is the _Ocean of Waters_, less mobile than air, less fixed than\r\nearth, but liable, in its movements, to the celestial bodies.\r\n\r\n3. _These three things_ form the gamut by which the Infinite speaks to\r\nour souls. Nevertheless, let us point out some very notable differences.\r\nThe _Air-ocean_ is so mobile that we can scarcely examine it. It\r\ndeceives; it decoys; it diverts; it dissipates, and breaks up our chain\r\nof thought.\r\n\r\n4. For an instant, it is an immense hope, the day of all infinity; anon,\r\nit is not so; all flies from before us, and our hearts are grieved,\r\nagitated, and filled with doubt. Why have I been permitted to see for a\r\nmoment that immense flood of light? The memory of that brief gleaming\r\nmust ever abide with me, and that memory makes all things here on earth\r\nlook dark.\r\n\r\n5. The _fixed Ocean of the mountains_ is not thus transient or fugitive;\r\non the contrary, it stops us at every step, and imposes upon us the\r\nnecessity of a very hard, though wholesome gymnastic. Contemplation here\r\nhas to be bought at the price of the most violent action. Nevertheless,\r\nthe opacity of the earth, like the transparency of the air, frequently\r\ndeceives and bewilders us. Who can forget that for ten years, Ramon, in\r\nvain, sought to reach Mount Perdu though often within sight of it?\r\n\r\n6. Great, _very great_, is the difference between the elements; the\r\nearth is mute and the ocean speaks. The ocean is a voice. It speaks to\r\nthe distant stars; it answers to their movements in its deep and solemn\r\nlanguage. It speaks to the earth on the shores, replying to the echoes\r\nthat reply again; by turns wailing, soothing, threatening--its deepest\r\nroar is presently succeeded by a sad, pathetic silence.\r\n\r\n7. And it especially addresses itself to man. It is creation\'s living\r\neloquence. It is Life speaking to Life. The millions, the countless\r\nmyriads of beings to which it gives birth, are its words. All these,\r\nmingled together make the unity, the great and solemn voice of the\r\nocean. And "what are those wild waves saying?" They are talking of\r\n_Life,--of Immortality._\r\n\r\n8. An indomitable strength is at the bottom of Nature--how much more so\r\nat Nature\'s summit, the Soul! And it speaks of partnership, of union.\r\nLet us accept the swift exchange which, in the individual, exists\r\nbetween the diverse elements; let us accept the superior Law which\r\nunites the living members of the same body--Humanity; and, still more,\r\nlet us accept and respect the supreme Law which makes us co-operate with\r\nthe great Soul, associated as we are--in proportion with our\r\npowers--with the loving harmony of the world--copartners in the life of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. What are three great forms of Nature? 2. What is said of\r\nthe Air-ocean? 3.

Who opened up to men the great distant navigation? Who revealed the\r\nocean, and marked out its zones and its liquid highways? Who discovered\r\nthe secrets of the globe? _The Whale and the Whaler!_ And all this\r\nbefore Columbus and the famous gold-seekers, who have monopolized all\r\nthe glory, found again, with much outcry about their discovery, what had\r\nso long before been discovered by the whalers.\r\n\r\n2. That crossing of the ocean, which was so boastfully celebrated in the\r\nfifteenth century, had often been made, not only by the narrow passage\r\nbetween Iceland and Greenland, but, also, by the open sea; for the\r\nBasques [Headnote 1] went to Newfoundland. The smallest danger was the\r\nmere voyage; for these men, who went to the very end of the _then_ known\r\nworld, to challenge the whale to single combat, to steer right away into\r\nthe Northern sea, to attack the mighty monster, amid darkness and\r\nstorms, with the dense fog all around, and the foaming waves\r\nbelow,--those who could do this, were not the men to shrink from the\r\nordinary dangers of the voyage.\r\n\r\n3. Noble warfare! Great school of courage! That fishery was not _then_,\r\nas it is _now_, an easy war to wage, made from a distance, and with a\r\npotently murderous machine. No; the fisher then struck with his own\r\nstrong hand, impelled and guided by his own fearless heart, and he\r\nrisked life to take life. The men of that day killed but few whales; but\r\nthey gained infinitely in maritime ability, in patience, in sagacity,\r\nand in intrepidity. They brought back _less_ of oil; but _more, far\r\nmore_ of glory.\r\n\r\n4. Every nation has its own peculiar genius. We recognize each by its\r\nown style of procedure. There are a hundred forms of courage, and these\r\ngraduated varieties formed, as it were, another heroic game. At the\r\nNorth, the Scandinavian, the rude race from Norway to Flanders, had\r\ntheir sanguine fury. At the South, the wild burst, the gay daring, the\r\nclear-headed excitement, that impelled, at once, and guided them over\r\nthe world. In the center, the silent and patient firmness of the\r\nBreton [Headnote 2], who yet, in the hour of danger, could display a\r\nquite sublime eccentricity. And, lastly, the Norman [Headnote 3]\r\nwariness, considerately courageous; daring all, but daring all for\r\nsuccess. Such was the beauty of man, in that sovereign manifestation of\r\nhuman courage.\r\n\r\n5. We owe a vast deal to the whale. But for it, the fishers would still\r\nhave hugged the shore; for, almost every edible fish seeks the shore and\r\nthe river. It was the whale that emancipated them, and led them afar. It\r\nled them onward, and onward still, until they found it, after having\r\nalmost unconsciously passed from one world to the other. Greenland did\r\nnot seduce them; it was not _the land_ that they sought; but _the sea,\r\nand the tracks of the whale_.\r\n\r\n6. The ocean at large is its home, and _especially_ the broad and open\r\nsea. Each species has its especial preference for this or that\r\nlatitude,--for a certain zone of water, more or less cold. And it was\r\n_that_ preference which traced out the great divisions of the Atlantic.\r\nThe tribe of inferior whales, that have a dorsal fin, are to be found in\r\nthe warmest and in the coldest seas,--under the line and in the polar\r\nseas.\r\n\r\n7. In the great intermediate region, the fierce Cachalot inclines toward\r\nthe south, devastating the warm waters. On the contrary, the Free Whale\r\nfears the warm waters,--we should rather say, that they did, formerly,\r\nfear them,--they have become so scarce. They are never found in the warm\r\nsouthern current; it is _that_ fact that led to the current being\r\nnoticed, and thence to the discovery of the _true course from America to\r\nEurope_. From Europe to America, the trade winds will serve us.\r\n\r\n8. If the Free Whale has a perfect horror of the warm waters, and can\r\nnot pass the equator, it is clear that he can not double the southern\r\nend of America. How happens it, then, that when he is wounded on one\r\nside of America, in the Atlantic, he is sometimes found on the other\r\nside of America, and in the Pacific? _It proves that there is a\r\nnorth-western passage_. Another discovery which we owe to the whale, and\r\none which throws a broad light alike on the form of the globe, and the\r\ngeography of the seas!\r\n\r\n9. By degrees, the whale has led us everywhere. Rare as he is at\r\npresent, he has led us to both poles, from the uttermost recesses of the\r\nPacific to Behring\'s Strait, and the infinite wastes of the Antarctic\r\nwaters. There is even an enormous region that no vessel, whether\r\nwar-ship or merchantman, ever traverses, at a few degrees beyond the\r\nsouthern points of America and Africa. No one visits that region but the\r\nwhaler.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. What has been done by the whaler? 2. By whom had\r\nNewfoundland been discovered? 3. What is said of the courage of the\r\nwhaler? 4. What proof is given that there is a north-western passage,\r\nby water, from the Atlantic to the Pacific?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLESSON CIX.\r\n\r\n   THRALL\' DOM, bondage; slavery.\r\n   IG NO\' BLE, mean; degraded.\r\n   HORDE, clan; tribe.\r\n   FEUD\' AL, pertaining to military tenure.\r\n   DES\' POTS, tyrants.\r\n   PAL\' TRY, mean; contemptible.\r\n   RAP\' INE,(_rapin;_) plunder; violence.\r\n   FOR SOOTH\', in truth; in fact.\r\n   RUF\' FIAN, robber; cut-throat.\r\n   SERV\' ILE, slavish; cringing.\r\n   LIM\' NERS, painters.\r\n   DIS CI\' PLE, learner; follower.\r\n   CORSE, corpse; dead body.\r\n   BRAWL, wrangle; contention.\r\n   DIS TAIN\' ED, sullied; stained.\r\n   ECH\' O ED, resounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIENZI\'S ADDRESS TO THE ROMANS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: RI EN\' ZI, the last of the Roman Tribunes, was born in Rome\r\nabout the year 1310.

"_We all do fade as a leaf_." Change is the essence of life. "Passing\r\naway," is written on all things; and passing away is passing on from\r\nstrength to strength, from glory to glory. Spring has its growth, summer\r\nits fruitage, and autumn its festive in-gathering. The spring of eager\r\npreparation waxes into the summer of noble work; mellowing in its turn\r\ninto the serene autumn, the golden-brown haze of October, when the soul\r\nmay robe itself in jubilant drapery, awaiting the welcome command, "Come\r\nup higher," where mortality shall be swallowed up in life.\r\n\r\n2. Why, then, should autumn tinge our thoughts with sadness. We fade as\r\nthe leaf, and the leaf fades only to revivify. Though it fall, it shall\r\nrise again. Does the bud fear to become a blossom, or the blossom\r\nshudder as it swells into fruit; and shall the redeemed weep that they\r\nmust become glorified\'? Strange inconsistency`! We faint with the burden\r\nand the heat of the day. We bow down under the crosses that are laid\r\nupon our shoulders. We are bruised and torn by the snares and pitfalls\r\nwhich beset our way, and into which our unwary feet often fall.\r\n\r\n3. We are famished, and foot-sore, and travel-stained, from our long\r\njourney, and yet we are saddened by tokens that we shall pass away from\r\nall these,--away from sin and sorrow, from temptation and fall, from\r\ndisappointment, and weary waiting, and a fearful looking-for of evil, to\r\npurity and holiness, and the full fruition of every hope,--bliss which\r\neye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor heart conceived,--to a world\r\nwhence all that made this dreary is forever banished, and where all that\r\nmade this delightful is forever renewed and increased,--a world where\r\nthe activities and energies of the soul shall have full scope, and love\r\nand recognition wait upon its steps forever.\r\n\r\n4. Let him alone fear, who does not fade as the leaf,--him whose\r\nsources are not in God, and who does not draw his life thence,--him\r\nwhose spring is gathering no strength, whose summer is maturing no\r\nfruit, and whose autumn shall have no vintage. Is not this the real\r\nsorrow of us all? not a dread of change, but a secret consciousness of\r\nwasted power,--of disloyalty to God, as the supreme object of our love\r\nand service.\r\n\r\n5. Yet even here the fading leaf brings hope. Our future is always\r\nbefore us. The past is fixed. No tears can wash away its facts. Let us\r\nwaste no vain regrets upon it; but, from the wisdom which its very\r\nmistakes and sins have bequeathed us, start afresh on the race. Though\r\nyesterday we were weak, and selfish, and indolent, let us to-day--at\r\nthis moment--begin to be strong, and brave, and helpful, and just, and\r\ngenerous, and considerate, and tender, and truthful, and pure, and\r\npatient, and forgiving. "Now" is a glorious word. "HENCEFORTH" is always\r\nwithin our grasp.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. To what are we compared? 2. What is said of change? 3.\r\nWhat change takes place in the leaf? 4.

With arm in arm the forest rose on high,\r\n   And lesson gave of brotherly regard;\r\n   And, on the rugged mountain brow exposed,\r\n   Bearing the blast alone, the ancient oak\r\n   Stood, lifting high his mighty arm, and still\r\n   To courage in distress exhorted loud.\r\n   The flocks, the herds, the birds, the streams, the breeze,\r\n   Attuned the heart to melody and love.\r\n\r\n3. Mercy stood in the cloud, with eye that wept\r\n   Essential love; and, from her glorious brow,\r\n   Bending to kiss the earth in token of peace,\r\n   With her own lips, her gracious lips, which God\r\n   Of sweetest accent made, she whispered still,\r\n   She whispered to Revenge, Forgive! forgive!\r\n\r\n4.

I saw the young bride, in her beauty and pride,\r\n     Bedecked in her snowy array;\r\n   And the bright flush of joy mantled high on her cheek,\r\n     And the future looked blooming and gay:\r\n   And with a woman\'s devotion she laid her fond heart\r\n     At the shrine of idolatrous love;\r\n   And she anchored her hopes to this perishing earth,\r\n     By the chain which her tenderness wove.\r\n   But I saw, when those heartstrings were bleeding and torn,\r\n     And the chain had been severed in two,\r\n   She had changed her white robes for the sables of grief,\r\n     And her bloom for the paleness of woe!\r\n   But the Healer was there, pouring balm on her heart,\r\n     And wiping the tears from her eyes;\r\n   And He strengthened the chain He had broken in twain,\r\n     And fastened it firm to the skies!\r\n   There had whispered a voice,--\'twas the voice of her God:\r\n   "I love thee--I love thee--_pass under the rod!_"\r\n\r\n2. I saw the young mother in tenderness bend\r\n     O\'er the couch of her slumbering boy;\r\n   And she kissed the soft lips as they murmured her name,\r\n     While the dreamer lay smiling in joy.\r\n   Oh, sweet as the rose-bud encircled with dew,\r\n     When its fragrance is flung on the air,\r\n   So fresh and so bright to that mother he seemed,\r\n     As he lay in his innocence there.\r\n   But I saw when she gazed on the same lovely form,\r\n     Pale as marble, and silent, and cold,\r\n   But paler and colder her beautiful boy,\r\n     And the tale of her sorrow was told!\r\n   But the Healer was there, who had stricken her heart,\r\n     And taken her treasure away;\r\n   To allure her to heaven, He has placed it on high,\r\n     And the mourner will sweetly obey.\r\n   There had whispered a voice,--\'twas the voice of her God:\r\n   "I love thee--I love thee--_pass under the rod!_"\r\n\r\n3. I saw, too, a father and mother who leaned\r\n     On the arms of a dear gifted son;\r\n   And the star in the future grew bright to their gaze,\r\n     As they saw the proud place he had won;\r\n   And the fast coming evening of life promised fair,\r\n     And its pathway grew smooth to their feet,\r\n   And the starlight of love glimmered bright at the end,\r\n     And the whispers of fancy were sweet.\r\n   And I saw them again, bending low o\'er the grave,\r\n     Where their hearts\' dearest hope had been laid;\r\n   And the star had gone down in the darkness of night,\r\n     And the joy from their bosoms had fled.\r\n   But the Healer was there, and His arms were around,\r\n     And He led them with tenderest care;\r\n   And He showed them a star in the bright upper world,\r\n     \'Twas their star shining brilliantly there!\r\n   They had each heard a voice,--\'twas the voice of their God:\r\n   "I love thee--I love thee--_pass under the rod_!"\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

He\'s the\r\ncrossest little man I have met with in the new country. You might scrape\r\nold Ireland with a fine-tooth comb, and not find such another.\r\n\r\n_Grim_.

Didn\'t you send a\r\ncarriage for me to the cars, half an hour too late, so that I had to\r\nhire one myself, after great trouble\'? And did I roar at you, when we\r\nmet, because you had done these things\'?\r\n\r\n_Grim_. On the contrary, this is the first time you have alluded to\r\nthem. I am sorry they should have happened. But surely you should make a\r\n_distinction_ between any such little oversight of mine, and the\r\nstupidity of a servant, hired to attend to your orders.\r\n\r\n_Cousin_. I do not admit that there should be a distinction. You are\r\nboth human; only, as you have had the better education, and the greater\r\nadvantages, stupidity or neglect on your part, is much the more\r\nculpable.\r\n\r\n_Grim_. Thank you! Go on.\r\n\r\n_Cousin_. I mean to; so don\'t be impatient. If an uncooked potato, or a\r\nburnt mutton-chop, happens to fall to your lot at the dinner-table, what\r\na tempest follows! One would think you had been wronged, insulted,\r\ntrampled on, driven to despair. Your face is like a thunder-cloud, all\r\nthe rest of the meal. Your poor wife endeavors to hide her tears. Your\r\nchildren feel timid and miserable. Your guest feels as if she would like\r\nto see you held under the nose of the pump, and thoroughly ducked.\r\n\r\n_Grim_. The carriage is waiting for you, Miss Somerville, and the driver\r\nhas put on your baggage.\r\n\r\n_Cousin_. I have hired that carriage by the hour, and so am in no hurry.\r\nYour excuse for your irritability will be, I suppose, that it is\r\n_constitutional_, and not to be controlled. A selfish, paltry, miserable\r\nexcuse! I have turned down a leaf in Dr. Johnson\'s works, and will read\r\nwhat he says in regard to tempers like yours.\r\n\r\n_Grim_. You are always quoting Dr. Johnson! Cousin, I can not endure it!\r\nDr. Johnson is a bore!\r\n\r\n_Cousin_. Oh, yes! to _evil-doers_,--but to none else. Hear him: "There\r\nis in the world a class of mortals known, and contentedly known, by the\r\nappellation of _passionate men_, who imagine themselves entitled, by\r\nthis distinction, to be provoked on every slight occasion, and to vent\r\ntheir rage in vehement and fierce vociferations, in furious menaces, and\r\nlicentious reproaches."\r\n\r\n_Grim_. That will do.\r\n\r\n_Cousin_. "Men of this kind," he tells us, "are often pitied rather than\r\ncensured, and are not treated with the severity which their neglect of\r\nthe ease of all about them, might justly provoke." But he adds: "It is\r\nsurely not to be observed without indignation, that men may be found of\r\nminds mean enough to be satisfied with this treatment; wretches who are\r\nproud to obtain the privilege of madmen, and----"\r\n\r\n_Grim_. I will hear no more! Have done!\r\n\r\n_Cousin_. So the shaft went home! I am not sorry.\r\n\r\n_Grim_. No one but a meddlesome old maid would think of insulting a man\r\nin his own house.\r\n\r\n_Cousin_. So, when, at a loss for a vindication, you reproach me with\r\nbeing an old maid! Cousin, it does not distress me, either to be an old\r\nmaid, or to be called one. I must, however, remark, that the manhood\r\nthat can charge against a woman her single state, either as a matter of\r\nridicule or reproach, is not quite up to my standard.\r\n\r\n_Grim_. Cousin Mary, I ask your pardon! But am I, indeed, the petulant,\r\ndisagreeable fellow, you would make me out?\r\n\r\n_Cousin_. My dear Caspar, you are generous enough in large things; but,\r\noh! consider that _trifles make up a good portion of the sum of life_;\r\nand so "_a small unkindness is a great offense_." Why not be cheerful,\r\nsunny, genial, in little things? Why not look on the bright side? Why\r\nnot present an unruffled front to petty annoyances? Why not labor,--ay,\r\nlabor,--to have those around you happy and contented, by reflecting from\r\nyourself such a frame of mind upon them?\r\n\r\nLife is short, at the best; why not make it cheerful? Do you know that\r\nlongevity is promoted by a tranquil, happy habit of thought and temper\'?\r\nDo you know that cheerfulness, like mercy, is twice blessed; blessing\r\n"him that gives, and him that takes\'?" Do you know that good manners, as\r\nwell as good sense, demand that we should look at objects on their\r\nbright side\'? Do you know that it is contemptible selfishness in you to\r\nshed gloom and sorrow over a whole family by your moroseness and\r\nill-humor\'?\r\n\r\n_Grim_. Cousin Mary, the patience with which I have listened to your\r\ncutting remarks, will prove to you, I hope, that, notwithstanding my\r\nangry retorts, I am convinced there is much truth in what you have said\r\nof me. I have a favor to ask. Send away your carriage; stay a week\r\nlonger,--a month,--a year, if you will. Hold the lash over this ugly\r\ntemper of mine,--and I give you my word that I will set about the cure\r\nof it in earnest.\r\n\r\n_Cousin_. You should have begun earlier,--in youth, when the temper is\r\npliable, and strong impressions can work great changes. But we will not\r\ndespair. I will tarry with you a while, just to see if you are serious\r\nin your wish for a reformation, and to help you bring it about.\r\n\r\n_Grim_. Thank you. We hear of reformed drunkards, and reformed thieves;\r\nand _why may not a petulant temper be reformed_, but a system of total\r\nabstinence from all harsh, unkind moods and expressions? Come, we will\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1. At what was Mr. Grim offended? 2. What did Cousin Mary\r\nsay would be fortunate for him? 3.

McELLIGOTT.\r\n\r\n 1. A Brahmin went out, the legends say,\r\n    To buy him a sheep a certain day;\r\n    For he had solemnly vowed to slay,\r\n    In sacrifice, a sheep that day,\r\n    And wanted a sheep his vow to pay.\r\n        Three neighboring rogues\r\n        (The cunning dogs!)\r\n        Finding this out,\r\n        Went straight about\r\n    (Moved, I ween, by the very Old Nick,)\r\n    To play the Brahmin a scurvy trick.\r\n\r\n 2. So one of them met him with the cry:--\r\n    "O Brahmin! O Brahmin! won\'t you buy\r\n    A beautiful sheep? for here have I\r\n    A beautiful sheep for sacrifice,\r\n    As ever was seen by mortal eyes."\r\n\r\n 3. "Where is your sheep?" replied the Brahmin;\r\n    "Bring him out here, and let me examine."\r\n        With that the wag\r\n        Opened a bag,\r\n        And out he drew\r\n        To public view\r\n    An ugly, dirty, horrible dog!\r\n    Blind as a bat, and lame as a frog;\r\n    With a broken leg, climbing a log.\r\n    Or limping slowly over a bog.\r\n\r\n 4. "Wretch!" said the Brahmin indignant, "who\r\n    Shamelessly utterest things untrue,\r\n    And dost without a scruple endure\r\n    To handle creatures the most impure,\r\n    How darest thou call that cur a sheep?\r\n    Do you think, foul knave, that I\'m asleep?"\r\n\r\n 5. "_Cur\'!_" said the fellow with steady tone;\r\n    "A _sheep_ it is, and a sheep alone;\r\n    A sheep (see here, what a splendid fleece!)\r\n    With flesh the sweetest, and fat as grease;\r\n        And such a prize\r\n        For sacrifice,\r\n    As neither gods nor men can despise,\r\n    Unless they both have dust in their eyes!"\r\n    "Sir," said the Brahmin, surprised to find\r\n    A person so utterly out of his mind,\r\n    "\'Tis certain that _you_ or _I_ am blind."\r\n\r\n 6.     Then stepping up,\r\n        Patting the pup,\r\n    Rogue the second, as if amazed,\r\n    While on the dog he steadily gazed,\r\n    Exclaims aloud:--"The gods be praised!\r\n    Since I\'ve no need to market to go\r\n    To buy me a sheep; for here\'s one so\r\n    From spot and blemish perfectly free,\r\n    That better could not possibly be.\r\n        Isn\'t it nice?\r\n        What\'s your price?"\r\n\r\n 7. The Brahmin, seeing this singular thing,\r\n    Wavered in mind, like one in a swing;\r\n    Yet answered the stranger, firmly,--"Sir,\r\n    This isn\'t a sheep, but only a cur."\r\n    "_Cur_?" with disdain, the new-comer said;\r\n    "Why, man, you\'re surely out of your head!"\r\n\r\n 8.     As this occurred,\r\n        Came rogue the third,\r\n    To whom, as being a witness new,\r\n    And likely to take impartial view,\r\n    Brahmin proposed at once to refer,\r\n    Whether the creature was _sheep_ or _cur_.\r\n    All being agreed, the eager priest\r\n    Said:--"Stranger, what do you call this beast?"\r\n    "A _sheep_, to be sure!" the knave replied;\r\n    "As fine a sheep as ever you spied."\r\n\r\n 9. "Well," said the Brahmin, "the gods this day\r\n    Have surely taken my senses away!"\r\n        Then begging the rogue\r\n        That carried the dog,\r\n    To pardon him for doubting his word,\r\n    He, with a readiness most absurd,\r\n    Purchased the creature with rice and ghee,\r\n    Which went, of course, to the worthless three,\r\n    And which they shared with wonderful glee.\r\n\r\n10.     Thus taken in,\r\n        The poor Brahmin\r\n        Offered it up,\r\n        The filthy pup,\r\n    Which so offended the gods, that they\r\n    Sent sore disease his folly to pay:\r\n    Thinking it right the man to chastise\r\n    For so distrusting his natural eyes,\r\n    And being led by palpable lies\r\n    To offer a dog as a sacrifice.\r\n\r\nMORAL.\r\n\r\n    Look out for the arts of the puffing tribe,--\r\n    People that praise for the sake of a bribe;\r\n    Lavishly lauding a book or a pill,\r\n    Or any thing else the pocket to fill;\r\n    Singing Simplicity fast asleep,\r\n    And making her dream a dog\'s a sheep.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.--1.

Who hath the hurried step, the anxious eye,\r\n   Avoids the public haunt and open street,\r\n   And anxious waits for evening? Restlessly\r\n   Tosses upon his bed, and dreads the approach\r\n   Of the tell-tale morning sunlight? Who, unmanned,\r\n   Starts at the sudden knock, and shrinks with dread\r\n   E\'en at his own shadow; shuns with care\r\n   The stranger\'s look, skulks from his fellow\'s glance,\r\n   And sees in every man a creditor?\r\n\r\n3. The _debtor_;--he is only half a man;\r\n   He saddens and estranges his chief friends,\r\n   Burdens his dearest relatives; he hears\r\n   In vain the stranger\'s tale, the widow\'s prayer,\r\n   And sends away the orphan all unalmsed.\r\n   None dare to place him in a post of trust,\r\n   And business men regard him with a shrug.\r\n\r\n4. "Owe no man aught." Stand in the world erect,\r\n   And lean alone upon thyself and God.\r\n   The habitual borrower will be ever found\r\n   Wicked, or weak, or both.

Have fewest wants: the book, however good,\r\n   Thou shouldst not purchase, let it go unbought;\r\n   And fashion\'s vests by thee be all unworn.\r\n   Soon luxuries become necessities,\r\n   But self-denying thrift more joy affords\r\n   Than all the pleasures of extravagance.\r\n   A cottage, free from clamorous creditors,\r\n   Is better than a mansion dunned; a coat,\r\n   However darned, if paid for, hath an ease,\r\n   And a respectability beside:\r\n   Gay, ill-afforded vests can never boast.\r\n\r\n6.                           However cheap,\r\n   Whatever thou want\'st not, buy not. That is dear,\r\n   A mere extravagant impertinence,\r\n   For which thou hast no need. Feel first the want\r\n   Ere it be satisfied; bargains full oft\r\n   Are money-wasting things, that prudent men\r\n   Will keep afar from with suspicious eye;\r\n   Perchance to any but of little use,\r\n   And to themselves, most likely, none at all.\r\n\r\n7.

Thou shalt then\r\n   Want not an alms for pinching poverty;\r\n   And, though a sudden sickness dam the stream,\r\n   And cut off thy supplies, thou shalt lie down\r\n   And view thy morrows with a tranquil eye;\r\n   Even benumbing age shall scare thee not,\r\n   But find thee unindebted, and secure\r\n   From all the penury and wretchedness\r\n   That dog the footsteps of improvidence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLESSON CXVIII.\r\n\r\n   OM NIP\' O TENT, all-powerful.\r\n   IN TER\' MI NA BLE, endless.\r\n   MILK Y-WAY, galaxy; luminous circle in the heavens.\r\n   AS\' TRAL, starry.\r\n   IN FIN\' I TUDE, unlimited extent.\r\n   IM PET\' U OUS, rushing.\r\n   AS TRON O MER, one skilled in the science of the stars.\r\n   AP PROX\' I MATE LY, nearly.\r\n   OM NIS\' CIENCE, knowledge of all things.\r\n   PER TUR BA\' TIONS, irregularities of motion.\r\n   AB\' SO LUTE, entire.\r\n   PRE CIS\' ION, exactness.\r\n   AD JUST\' MENTS, arrangements.\r\n   RET\' I NUE, company.\r\n   SAT\' EL LITES, small planets revolving round others.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANDEUR OF THE UNIVERSE.\r\n\r\nO.M. MITCHEL.\r\n\r\n1. If you would know the _glory_ of the Omnipotent Ruler of the\r\nuniverse, examine the interminable range of suns and systems which crowd\r\nthe Milky-Way. Multiply the hundred millions of stars which belong to\r\nour own "island universe" by the thousands of these astral systems that\r\nexist in space, within the range of human vision, and _then_ you may\r\nform some idea of the _infinitude_ of His kingdom; for lo! these are but\r\na part of His ways.\r\n\r\n2. Examine the scale on which the universe is built. Comprehend, if you\r\ncan, the vast dimensions of our sun. Stretch outward through his system,\r\nfrom planet to planet, and circumscribe the whole within the immense\r\ncircumference of Neptune\'s orbit. This is but a single unit out of the\r\nmyriads of similar systems.\r\n\r\n3. Take the wings of light, and flash with impetuous speed, day and\r\nnight, and month, and year, till youth shall wear away, and middle age\r\nis gone, and the extremest limit of human life has been attained;--count\r\nevery pulse, and, at each, speed on your way a hundred thousand miles;\r\nand when a hundred years have rolled by, look out, and behold! the\r\nthronging millions of blazing suns are still around you, each separated\r\nfrom the other by such a distance, that, in this journey of a century,\r\nyou have only left half a score behind you.\r\n\r\n4. Would you gather some idea of the _eternity_ past of God\'s\r\nexistence,--go to the astronomer, and bid him lead you in one of his\r\nwalks through space; and, as he sweeps outward from object to object,\r\nfrom universe to universe, remember that the light from those filmy\r\nstains on the deep pure blue of heaven, now falling on your eye, has\r\nbeen traversing space for a million of years.\r\n\r\n5. Would you gather some knowledge of the _omnipotence_ of God,--weigh\r\nthe earth on which we dwell, then count the millions of its inhabitants\r\nthat have come and gone for the last six thousand years. Unite their\r\nstrength into one arm, and test its power in an effort to move this\r\nearth. It could not stir it a single foot in a thousand years; and yet\r\nunder the omnipotent hand of God, not a minute passes that it does not\r\nfly more than a thousand miles.\r\n\r\n6. But this is a mere atom,--the most insignificant point among his\r\ninnumerable worlds. At his bidding, every planet, and satellite, and\r\ncomet, and the sun himself, fly onward in their appointed courses. His\r\nsingle arm guides the millions of sweeping suns, and around His throne\r\ncircles the great constellation of unnumbered universes.\r\n\r\n7. Would you comprehend the idea of the _omniscience_ of God,--remember\r\nthat the highest pinnacle of knowledge reached by the whole human race,\r\nby the combined efforts of its brightest intellects, has enabled the\r\nastronomer to compute approximately the perturbations of the planetary\r\nworlds. He has predicted roughly the return of half a score of comets.\r\nBut God has computed the mutual perturbations of millions of suns, and\r\nplanets, and comets, and worlds, without number, through the ages that\r\nare passed, and throughout the ages which are yet to come, not\r\napproximately, but with perfect and absolute precision.\r\n\r\n8. The universe is in motion,--system rising above system, cluster above\r\ncluster, nebula above nebula,--all majestically sweeping around under\r\nthe providence of God, who alone knows the end from the beginning, and\r\nbefore whose glory and power all intelligent beings, whether in heaven\r\nor on earth, should bow with humility and awe.\r\n\r\n9. Would you gain some idea of the _wisdom_ of God,--look to the\r\nadmirable adjustments of the magnificent retinue of planets and\r\nsatellites which sweep around the sun. Every globe has been weighed and\r\npoised, every orbit has been measured and bent to its beautiful form.\r\n\r\n10. All is changing; but the laws fixed by the wisdom of God, though\r\nthey permit the rocking to and fro of the system, never introduce\r\ndisorder, or lead to destruction. All is perfect and harmonious, and the\r\nmusic of the spheres that burn and roll around our sun, is echoed by\r\nthat of ten millions of moving worlds, that sing and shine around the\r\nbright suns that reign above.\r\n\r\n11. If, overwhelmed with the grandeur and majesty of the universe of\r\nGod, we are led to exclaim with the Hebrew poet-king,--"When I consider\r\nThy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which Thou\r\nhast ordained, what is man, that Thou art mindful of him? and the son of\r\nman, that Thou visitest him?"--If fearful that the eye of God may\r\noverlook us in the immensity of His kingdom, we have only to call to\r\nmind that other passage, "Yet Thou hast made him but a little lower than\r\nthe angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor. Thou madest him\r\nto have dominion over all the works of Thy hand; Thou hast put all\r\nthings under his feet." Such are the teachings of the word, and such are\r\nthe lessons of the works of God.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLESSON CXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n"WHOM HAVE I IN HEAVEN BUT THEE?"\r\n\r\nMISS PAMELIA S.

Mr. President: I consider it a particular favor of Providence that I\r\nam permitted to partake, on the present solemn occasion, in paying the\r\ntribute of honor and gratitude to the memory of your immortal\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n2. An architect having raised a proud and noble building to the service\r\nof the Almighty, his admirers desired to erect a monument to his memory.\r\nHow was it done? His name was inscribed upon the wall, with these\r\nadditional words: "You seek his monument--look around."\r\n\r\n3. Let him who looks for a monument of Washington look around the United\r\nStates. The whole country is a monument to him. Your freedom, your\r\nindependence, your national power, your prosperity, and your prodigious\r\ngrowth, is a monument to Washington.\r\n\r\n4. There is no room left for panegyric, none especially to a stranger\r\nwhom you had full reason to charge with arrogance, were he able to\r\nbelieve that his feeble voice could claim to be noticed in the mighty\r\nharmony of a nation\'s praise. Let me, therefore, instead of such an\r\narrogant attempt, pray that that God, to whose providential intentions\r\nWashington was a glorious instrument, may impart to the people of the\r\nUnited States the same wisdom for the conservation of the present\r\nprosperity of the land and for its future security, which he gave to\r\nWashington for the foundation of it.\r\n\r\n5. I yield to nobody in the world in reverence and respect to the\r\nimmortal memory of Washington. His life and his principles were the\r\nguiding star of my life; to that star I looked up for inspiration and\r\nadvice, during the vicissitudes of my stormy life. Hence I drew that\r\ndevotion to my country and to the cause of national freedom, which you,\r\ngentlemen, and millions of your fellow-citizens, and your national\r\ngovernment, are so kind as to honor by unexampled distinction.\r\n\r\n6. Sir, I have studied the history of your immortal Washington, and\r\nhave, from my early youth, considered his principles as a living source\r\nof instruction to statesmen and to patriots.\r\n\r\nWhen, in that very year in which Washington issued his Farewell Address,\r\nM. Adet, the French Minister, presented to him the flag of the French\r\nRepublic, Washington, as President of the United States, answered\r\nofficially, with these memorable words:\r\n\r\n"Born in a land of liberty, having early learned its value, having\r\nengaged in a perilous conflict to defend it, having devoted the best\r\nyears of my life to secure its permanent establishment in my country, my\r\nanxious recollections, my sympathetic feelings, and my best wishes, are\r\nirresistibly attracted, whensoever in any country I see an oppressed\r\nnation unfurl the banner of freedom."\r\n\r\n7. Thus spoke Washington. Have I not then full reason to say, that if he\r\nwere alive his generous sympathy would be with me; and the sympathy of a\r\nWashington never was, and never would be, a barren word. Washington, who\r\nraised the word "honesty" as a rule of policy, never would have\r\nprofessed a sentiment which his wisdom as a statesman would not have\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n8. Sir! here let me end. I consider it already as an immense benefit\r\nthat your generous attention connected the cause of Hungary with the\r\ncelebration of the memory of Washington.\r\n\r\n9. Spirit of the departed! smile down from heaven upon this appreciation\r\nof my country\'s cause; watch over those principles which thou hast taken\r\nfor the guiding star of thy noble life, and the time will yet come when\r\nnot only thine own country, but liberated Europe, also, will be a living\r\nmonument to thy immortal name.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLESSON CXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOST ONE\'S LAMENT.\r\n\r\n1. Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,\r\n   Filling the sky and earth below;\r\n   Over the housetops, over the street,\r\n   Over the heads of the people you meet,\r\n       Dancing,\r\n           Flirting,\r\n               Skimming along!\r\n   Beautiful snow! it can do no wrong.\r\n   Flying to kiss a fair lady\'s cheek,\r\n   Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,\r\n   Beautiful snow from the Heaven above,\r\n   Pure as an angel, gentle as love!\r\n\r\n2. Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,\r\n   How the flakes gather and laugh as they go?\r\n   Whirling about in its maddening fun,\r\n   It plays in its glee with every one;\r\n       Chasing,\r\n           Laughing,\r\n               Hurrying by,\r\n   It lights on the face and it sparkles the eye!\r\n   And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,\r\n   Snap at the crystals that eddy around.\r\n   The town is alive, and its heart in a glow\r\n   To welcome the coming of beautiful snow.\r\n\r\n3. How wild the crowd goes swaying along,\r\n   Hailing each other with humor and song!\r\n   How the gay sledges, like meteors, flash by,\r\n   Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye!\r\n       Ringing,\r\n           Swinging,\r\n               Dashing they go\r\n   Over the crust of the beautiful snow;\r\n   Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,\r\n   To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by,\r\n   To be trampled and tracked by thousands of feet,\r\n   Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street\r\n\r\n4. How strange it should be that this beautiful snow,\r\n   Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go!\r\n   How strange it should be, when the night comes again\r\n   If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain!\r\n       Fainting,\r\n           Freezing,\r\n               Dying alone,\r\n   Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan\r\n   To be heard in the crazy town,\r\n   Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down;\r\n   To lie and so die, in my terrible woe,\r\n   With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Sanders\' Union Fourth Reader, by Charles W.

Thus, we usually do not\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nWe are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance\r\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\r\nPlease be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,\r\neven years after the official publication date.\r\n\r\nPlease note neither this listing nor its contents are final til\r\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\r\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at\r\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\r\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\r\nand editing by those who wish to do so.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web sites at:\r\nhttp://gutenberg.net or\r\nhttp://promo.net/pg\r\n\r\nThese Web sites include award-winning information about Project\r\nGutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new\r\neBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).\r\n\r\n\r\nThose of you who want to download any eBook before announcement\r\ncan get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is\r\nalso a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the\r\nindexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an\r\nannouncement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or\r\nftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03\r\n\r\nOr /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90\r\n\r\nJust search by the first five letters of the filename you want,\r\nas it appears in our Newsletters.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\r\n\r\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\r\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\r\nto get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\r\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our\r\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value\r\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\r\nmillion dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text\r\nfiles per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+\r\nWe are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002\r\nIf they reach just 1-2% of the world\'s population then the total\r\nwill reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year\'s end.\r\n\r\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!\r\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\r\nwhich is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.\r\n\r\nHere is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):\r\n\r\neBooks Year Month\r\n\r\n    1  1971 July\r\n   10  1991 January\r\n  100  1994 January\r\n 1000  1997 August\r\n 1500  1998 October\r\n 2000  1999 December\r\n 2500  2000 December\r\n 3000  2001 November\r\n 4000  2001 October/November\r\n 6000  2002 December*\r\n 9000  2003 November*\r\n10000  2004 January*\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created\r\nto secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.\r\n\r\nWe need your donations more than ever!\r\n\r\nAs of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people\r\nand organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,\r\nDelaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,\r\nMichigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New\r\nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,\r\nOklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South\r\nDakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West\r\nVirginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\r\n\r\nWe have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones\r\nthat have responded.\r\n\r\nAs the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list\r\nwill be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.\r\nPlease feel free to ask to check the status of your state.\r\n\r\nIn answer to various questions we have received on this:\r\n\r\nWe are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally\r\nrequest donations in all 50 states.
