It has been\r\ncarefully revised by a Reverend gentleman, who for some time filled\r\nthe chair of Physics and Chemistry in one of our colleges.\r\n\r\nRecent inventions and improvements are described in a simple, popular\r\nstyle, so as to be easily understood by all, and short notices are\r\ngiven of prominent inventors and scientists. The paragraphs relating\r\nto doctrinal matters conform in every respect to the teachings of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nA feature which will commend the book to every teacher is the\r\ndefinitions of difficult words and terms, following the paragraphs in\r\nwhich such words occur.\r\n\r\nTechnical language is avoided as much as possible, so as to enable\r\nyoung pupils to become familiarly acquainted with the various\r\nphenomena of nature, the leading characteristics and general history\r\nof the objects of the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, and the\r\nfundamental truths of the arts and sciences.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations are of a superior order, and a very complete Index,\r\nwhich will be appreciated by every teacher, supplements the book. In a\r\nword, no pains have been spared to enhance the value of the work, and\r\nrender it an important auxiliary in the dissemination of useful and\r\nentertaining knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe publishers beg to acknowledge their obligations to the Sisters of\r\nMercy, Loretto, Pa., to whose kindness they are indebted for many\r\nvaluable suggestions.\r\n\r\nIn the hope that the book may be found suited to the accomplishment of\r\nits aim, it is respectfully submitted to schools and instructors of\r\nyouth, who are the best judges of its merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER\r\n\r\n    I.

During\r\nthe day, the powerful heat of the sun causes to arise from the earth\r\nand water a moist vapor, which, after the sun sinks below the horizon,\r\nis condensed by the cold, and falls in the form of dew. Dews are more\r\ncopious in the Spring and Autumn than at any other season; in warm\r\ncountries than in cold ones: because of the sudden changes of\r\ntemperature. Egypt abounds in dews all the summer; for the air being\r\ntoo hot to condense the vapors in the day-time, they never gather into\r\nclouds and form rain.\r\n\r\n     _Horizon_, the line which bounds the view on all sides, so\r\n     that the earth and sky appear to meet. A Greek word, from\r\n     the verb signifying to mark boundaries.\r\n\r\n     _Temperature_, degree of heat or cold.\r\n\r\n     _Condense_, to cause the particles of a body to approach or\r\n     unite more closely.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are its uses?\r\n\r\nIt cools and refreshes the vegetable creation, and prevents it from\r\nbeing destroyed by the heat of the sun. All hot countries where there\r\nis little or no rain are therefore blessed with this provision by the\r\nall-bountiful Creator, to render them luxuriant and inhabitable; and\r\nthe dews which fall are so copious, that the earth is as deeply soaked\r\nwith them during the night as if a heavy rain had fallen. For this\r\nreason also it is, that we so often read in the Bible of the "dew of\r\nHeaven" being promised to the Israelites as a signal favor.\r\n\r\n     _Luxuriant_, fertile, flourishing.\r\n\r\n     _Signal_, remarkable, eminent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what does the vapor originate?\r\n\r\nVapor is water, combined with a still greater quantity of\r\ncaloric,--that is, an imponderable and subtile form of matter, which\r\ncauses the sensation of heat; and which, driving asunder the particles\r\nof the water, renders it a\xc3\xabriform.\r\n\r\n     _Imponderable_, without sensible weight.\r\n\r\n     _Subtile_, thin, not dense, or compact.\r\n\r\n     _Particle_, a small portion of matter.\r\n\r\n     _A\xc3\xabriform_, having the form of air.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Water?\r\n\r\nThe fluid which covers more than three-fifths of the surface of our\r\nglobe, and which is necessary for the life and health of the animal\r\nand vegetable creation; for without water there would be neither rain\r\nnor dew, and everything would perish. It is likewise a necessary\r\nbeverage for man and the inferior animals.\r\n\r\n     _Beverage_, drink, liquor for drinking.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn how many states do we find Water?\r\n\r\nIn four: 1st, solid, as in ice, snow, hail, &c.; 2d, fluid, as in its\r\ncommon form; 3d, a\xc3\xabriform, as in steam; and 4th, in a state of union\r\nwith other matter. Its most simple state is that of ice, which is\r\nwater deprived of a certain portion of its caloric: crystallization\r\nthen takes place, and the water becomes solid and is called ice.\r\n\r\n     _Crystallization_, the process by which the parts of a solid\r\n     body, separated by solution or fusion, are again brought\r\n     into the solid form. If the process is slow, the figure\r\n     assumed is regular and bounded by plane and smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\n     _Solution_, the diffusion of a solid through some liquid.\r\n\r\n     _Fusion_, melting, or rendering fluid by heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what cause is the Water deprived of its caloric?\r\n\r\nFrom the coldness of the atmosphere: underneath the poles of our globe\r\nit is mostly solid; there it is similar to the hardest rocks, and may\r\nbe cut with a chisel, like stone or marble. This great solidity is\r\noccasioned by the low temperature of the surrounding air; and in very\r\ncold countries ice may be ground so fine as to be blown away by the\r\nwind, and will still be ice.\r\n\r\n     _Poles_, the extremities or ends of the axis, an imaginary\r\n     line, supposed to be drawn through the centre of the earth;\r\n     or when applied to the heavens, the two points directly over\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs ice the only instance of Water existing in a state of solidity?\r\n\r\nNo; it is found in a solid state in many minerals, as in marble, &c.,\r\nand is then called _water of Crystallization_. It is essential, in\r\nmany cases, to their solidity and transparency.\r\n\r\n     _Essential_, necessary.\r\n\r\n     _Transparency_, clearness, the power of transmitting light.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes Nature decompose Water in any of her operations?\r\n\r\nYes: every living vegetable has the power of decomposing water, by a\r\nsecret process peculiar to itself. Fish, too, and all cold-blooded\r\namphibious animals are gifted with the same power.\r\n\r\n     _Decomposing_, separating a mixed body into its several\r\n     parts.\r\n\r\n     _Amphibious_, able to live both in water and out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what use is this power to vegetables?\r\n\r\nThe water which they decompose affords them nourishment for the\r\nsupport of their vital juices, and enables them, by combining the\r\nfluid gases which compose it with those of the air and the soil, to\r\nform their different products; while the superfluous gas is abundantly\r\ngiven out by their leaves, to refresh the spent air, and render it\r\nwholesome for the animals that breathe it.\r\n\r\n     _Vital_, belonging to life, necessary to existence.\r\n\r\n     _Superfluous_, unnecessary, not wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Rain?\r\n\r\nThe condensed aqueous vapors raised in the atmosphere by the sun and\r\nwind, converted into clouds, which fall in rain, snow, hail, or mist:\r\ntheir falling is occasioned by their own weight in a collision\r\nproduced by contrary currents of wind, from the clouds passing into a\r\ncolder part of the air, or by electricity. If the vapors are more\r\ncopious, and rise a little higher, they form a mist or fog, which is\r\nvisible to the eye; higher still they produce rain. Hence we may\r\naccount for the changes of the weather: why a cold summer is always a\r\nwet one--a warm, a dry one.\r\n\r\n     _Aqueous_, watery; consisting of water.\r\n\r\n     _Collision_, a striking together, a clash, a meeting.\r\n\r\n     _Electricity_, a natural agent existing in all bodies (see\r\n     page 18).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat seasons are more liable to rain than others?\r\n\r\nThe Spring and Autumn are generally the most rainy seasons, the vapors\r\n_rise_ more plentifully in Spring; and in the Autumn, as the sun\r\nrecedes from us and the cold increases, the vapors, which lingered\r\nabove us during the summer heats, _fall_ more easily.\r\n\r\n     _Recede_, to fall back, to retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Snow?\r\n\r\nRain congealed by cold in the atmosphere, which causes it to fall to\r\nthe earth in white flakes. Snow fertilizes the ground by defending the\r\nroots of plants from the intenser cold of the air and the piercing\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\n     _Congealed_, turned by the force of cold from a fluid to a\r\n     solid state; hardened.\r\n\r\n     _Fertilize_, to render fruitful.\r\n\r\n     _Intenser_, raised to a higher degree, more powerful.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Hail?\r\n\r\nDrops of rain frozen in their passage through cold air. Hail assumes\r\nvarious figures according to the degrees of heat or cold through which\r\nit passes, being sometimes round, flat, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Atmosphere?\r\n\r\nThe mass of a\xc3\xabriform fluid which encompasses the earth on all sides:\r\nit extends about fifty miles above its surface. Air is the elastic\r\nfluid of which it is composed.\r\n\r\n     _Elastic_, having the power of springing back, or recovering\r\n     its former figure after the removal of any external pressure\r\n     which has altered that figure. When the force which\r\n     compresses the air is removed, it expands and resumes its\r\n     former state.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the uses of air?\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to the well-being of man, since without it neither he\r\nnor any animal or vegetable could exist. If it were not for\r\natmospheric air, we should be unable to converse with each other; we\r\nshould know nothing of sound or smell; or of the pleasures which arise\r\nfrom the variegated prospects which surround us: it is to the presence\r\nof air and carbonic acid that water owes its agreeable taste. Boiling\r\ndeprives it of the greater part of these, and renders it insipid.\r\n\r\n     _Variegated_, diversified, changed; adorned with different\r\n     colors.\r\n\r\n     _Insipid_, tasteless.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Wind?\r\n\r\nAir in motion with any degree of velocity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Lightning?\r\n\r\nThe effect of electricity in the clouds. A flash of lightning is\r\nsimply a stream of the electric fluid passing from the clouds to the\r\nearth, from the earth to the clouds, or from one cloud to another.\r\nLightning usually strikes the highest and most pointed objects, as\r\nhigh hills, trees, spires, masts of ships, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Thunder?\r\n\r\nThe report which accompanies the electrical union of the clouds: or\r\nthe echoes of the report between them and the earth. Thunder is caused\r\nby a sudden discharge of electrical matter collected in the air, by\r\nwhich vibrations are produced, which give rise to the sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Electricity?\r\n\r\nOne of those agents passing through the earth and all substances,\r\nwithout giving any outward signs of its presence, when at rest; yet\r\nwhen active, often producing violent and destructive effects. It is\r\n_supposed_ to be a highly elastic fluid, capable of moving through\r\nmatter. Clouds owe their form and existence, probably, to it; and it\r\npasses through all substances, but more easily through metals, water,\r\nthe human body, &c., which are called conductors, than through air,\r\nglass, and silk, which are called _non_-conductors. When bodies are\r\nnot surrounded with non-conductors, the electricity escapes quickly\r\ninto the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what part of bodies is Electricity confined?\r\n\r\nTo their surfaces, as the outside may be electric, and the inside in a\r\nstate of neutrality. The heat produced by an electric shock is very\r\npowerful, but is only accompanied by light when the fluid is\r\nobstructed in its passage. The production and condensation of vapor is\r\na great source of the atmospheric electricity.\r\n\r\n     _Condensation_, the act of making any body dense or compact;\r\n     that is, of bringing its parts into closer union.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what other sense is the term Electricity employed?\r\n\r\nThis term is also employed to designate that important branch of\r\nknowledge which relates to the properties shown by certain bodies when\r\nrubbed against, or otherwise brought in contact with, each other, to\r\nattract substances, and emit sparks of fire.\r\n\r\n     _Designate_, to point out by some particular token.\r\n\r\n     _Emit_, to send forth, to throw out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUTTING AND GATHERING ICE, ON THE HUDSON RIVER, NEW\r\nYORK.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence is the word derived?\r\n\r\nFrom _electron_, the Greek word for amber, a yellow transparent\r\nsubstance, remarkable for its electrical power when rubbed: amber is\r\nof a resinous nature, and is collected from the sea-shore, or dug from\r\nthe earth, in many parts of the world. It is employed in the\r\nmanufacture of beads and other toys, on account of its transparency;\r\nis of some use in medicine, and in the making of varnishes.\r\n\r\n     _Transparent_, clear, capable of being seen through.\r\n\r\n     _Resinous_, containing resin, a gummy vegetable juice.\r\n\r\n\r\nName a few substances possessing this remarkable property.\r\n\r\nSilks of all kinds; the hair and fur of animals, paper, sulphur, and\r\nsome other minerals; most of the precious stones; the paste of which\r\nfalse gems are made; and many other substances used by us in the\r\ncommon affairs of life, are susceptible of electrical excitement;\r\namong domestic animals the cat furnishes a remarkable instance. When\r\ndry and warm, the back of almost any full-grown cat (the darker its\r\ncolor the better) can be excited by rubbing it with the hand in the\r\ndirection of the hair, a process which is accompanied with a slight\r\nsnapping noise, and in the dark by flashes of pale blue light. When a\r\npiece of glass is rubbed with silk, or a stick of red sealing-wax with\r\nwoollen cloth, each substance acquires the property of attracting and\r\nrepelling feathers, straws, threads of cotton, and other light\r\nsubstances; the substances just mentioned as highly electric are,\r\nhowever, merely specimens. All objects, without exception, most\r\nprobably are capable of being electrically excited; but some require\r\nmore complicated contrivances to produce it than others.\r\n\r\n     _Electric_, having the properties of electricity.\r\n\r\n     _Susceptible_, disposed to admit easily.\r\n\r\n     _Repelling_, the act of driving back.\r\n\r\n     _Complicated_, formed by the union of several parts in one.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there not a machine by which we are enabled to obtain large\r\nsupplies of electric power at pleasure?\r\n\r\nYes; the electrical machine. It is made of different forms and sizes:\r\nfor common purposes those of the simplest form are the best. A common\r\nform of the machine consists of a circular plate of glass, which can\r\nbe turned about a horizontal axis by means of a suitable handle. This\r\nplate turns between two supports, and near its upper and lower edges\r\nare two pairs of cushions, usually made of leather, stuffed with\r\nhorse-hair and coated with a mixture of zinc, tin, and mercury, called\r\nan _amalgam_. These cushions are the rubbers for producing friction,\r\nand are connected with the earth by means of a metal chain or rod. Two\r\nlarge hollow cylinders of brass with globular ends, each supported by\r\ntwo glass pillars, constitute the reservoir for receiving the\r\nelectricity. They are called the _prime conductors_, and are supplied\r\nwith U-shaped rods of metal, furnished with points along their sides,\r\ncalled _combs_, for the purpose of receiving the electricity from the\r\nglass plate, the arms of the U being held upon either side. The other\r\nends of the conductors are connected by a rod from the middle of which\r\nprojects another rod terminating in a knob, for delivering the spark.\r\n\r\nOn turning the plate, a faint snapping sound is heard, and when the\r\nroom is darkened, a spark is seen to be thrown out from the knob\r\nprojecting from the _prime conductors_.\r\n\r\nMany curious and interesting experiments may be performed by means of\r\nthe machine, illustrating the general properties of electricity. For\r\ninstance: a person standing on an insulated bench, that is, a bench\r\nwith glass legs, or having the legs resting on glass, and having one\r\nhand on the conductor, can send sparks, with the other hand, to\r\neverything and everybody about. This illustrates communication of\r\nelectricity by contact. A wooden head, covered with long hairs, when\r\nplaced on the conductor, illustrates electrical repulsion, by the\r\nhairs standing on end.\r\n\r\nIf the hand is held to the knob, sparks will pass from it in rapid\r\nsuccession, causing in the hand a sensation of pain. This is called an\r\n_electric shock_, and is caused by the electric fluid occasioning a\r\nsudden motion by the contraction of the muscles through which it\r\npasses. The force of the shock is in proportion to the power of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the Muscles?\r\n\r\nBundles of thin fleshy fibres, or threads, fastened to the bones of\r\nanimals, the contraction and expansion of which move the bones or\r\nperform the organic functions of life.\r\n\r\n     _Organic_, relating to organs or natural instruments by\r\n     which some process is carried on.\r\n\r\n     _Functions_, employments or offices of any part of the body.\r\n\r\n     _Contraction_, drawing in or shortening.\r\n\r\n     _Expansion_, extending or spreading out.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Twilight?\r\n\r\nThe light from the first dawning of day to the rising of the sun; and\r\nagain between its setting and the last remains of day. Without\r\ntwilight, the sun\'s light would appear at its rising, and disappear at\r\nits setting, instantaneously; and we should experience a sudden\r\ntransition from the brightest sunshine to the profoundest obscurity.\r\nThe duration of twilight is different in different climates; and in\r\nthe same places it varies at different periods of the year.\r\n\r\n     _Instantaneously_, done in an instant, in a moment\'s time.\r\n\r\n     _Obscurity_, darkness, want of light.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is it produced?\r\n\r\nBy the sun\'s refraction--that is, the variation of the rays of light\r\nfrom their direct course, occasioned by the difference of density in\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\n     _Variation_, change.\r\n\r\n     _Density_, closeness of parts, compactness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the poetical name for the morning Twilight?\r\n\r\nAurora, the goddess of the morning, and harbinger of the rising sun:\r\nwhom poets and artists represent as drawn by white horses in a\r\nrose-colored chariot, unfolding with her rosy fingers the portals of\r\nthe East, pouring reviving dew upon the earth, and re-animating plants\r\nand flowers.\r\n\r\n     _Harbinger_, a forerunner.\r\n\r\n     _Portals_, gates, doors of entrance.\r\n\r\n     _Reanimating_, invigorating with new life.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat remarkable phenomenon is afforded to the inhabitants of the polar\r\nregions?\r\n\r\nThe Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, a luminous appearance in the\r\nnorthern parts of the heavens, seen mostly during winter, or in frosty\r\nweather, and clear evenings; it assumes a variety of forms and hues,\r\nespecially in the polar regions, where it appears in its perfection,\r\nand proves a great solace to the inhabitants amidst the gloom of their\r\nlong winter\'s night, which lasts from one to six months, while the\r\nsummer\'s day which succeeds it lasts in like manner for the same\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what nature is the Aurora Borealis?\r\n\r\nIt is decidedly an electrical phenomenon which takes place in the\r\nhigher regions of the atmosphere. It is somehow connected with the\r\nmagnetic poles of the earth; and generally appears in form of a\r\nluminous arch, from east to west, but never from north to south.\r\n\r\n     _Phenomenon_, an extraordinary appearance. The word is from\r\n     a Greek one, signifying, to show or appear.\r\n\r\n     _Magnetic_, belonging to the magnet, or loadstone.\r\n\r\n     _Luminous_, bright, shining.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what country is it seen constantly from October to Christmas?\r\n\r\nIn Siberia, where it is remarkably bright. On the western coast of\r\nHudson\'s Bay, the sun no sooner disappears, than the Aurora Borealis\r\ndiffuses a thousand different lights and colors with such dazzling\r\nbeauty, that even the full moon cannot eclipse it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCORN, BARLEY, PEARL BARLEY, OATS, RYE, POTATOES, TEA, COFFEE, AND\r\nCHOCOLATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Corn?\r\n\r\nCorn signifies a race of plants which produce grain in an ear or head,\r\nfit for bread, the food of man; or the grain or seed of the plant,\r\nseparated from the ear.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is generally meant by Corn?\r\n\r\nIn this country, maize, or Indian corn, is generally meant; but, in a\r\nmore comprehensive sense, the term is applied to several other kinds\r\nof grain, such as wheat, rye, barley, oats, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere was Corn first used?\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain. The Athenians pretend that it was amongst them it was\r\nfirst used; the Cretans, Sicilians, and Egyptians also lay claim to\r\nthe same. From the accounts in the Bible, we find that its culture\r\nengaged a large share of the attention of the ancient Hebrews.\r\n\r\n     _Culture_, growth, cultivation. _Hebrews_, the children of\r\n     Israel, the Jews\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the Athenians?\r\n\r\nInhabitants of Athens, the capital city of Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the Cretans?\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Crete, an island of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the Sicilians?\r\n\r\nInhabitants of Sicily, the largest island of the Mediterranean Sea,\r\nnow a part of Italy, and separated from the mainland by the Strait of\r\nMessina.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere do the Egyptians dwell?\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, a country of Africa. It is extremely fertile, producing\r\ngreat quantities of corn. In ancient times it was called the dry nurse\r\nof Rome and Italy, from its furnishing with corn a considerable part\r\nof the Roman Empire; and we are informed, both from sacred and\r\nprofane history, that it was anciently the most fertile in corn of all\r\ncountries of the world. The corn of Syria has always been very\r\nsuperior, and by many classed above that of Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what is Barley generally used?\r\n\r\nIt is very extensively used for making malt, from which are prepared\r\nbeer, ale, porter, &c.; in Scotland it is a common ingredient in\r\nbroths, for which reason its consumption is very considerable, barley\r\nbroth being a dish very frequent there.\r\n\r\n     _Ingredient_, a separate part of a body consisting of\r\n     different materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Pearl Barley?\r\n\r\nBarley freed from the husk by a mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Oats?\r\n\r\nA valuable grain, serving as food for horses. Oats are also eaten by\r\nthe inhabitants of many countries, after being ground into meal and\r\nmade into oat cakes. Oatmeal also forms a wholesome drink for\r\ninvalids, by steeping it in boiling water.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the uses of Rye?\r\n\r\nIn this and some other countries it is much used for bread, either\r\nalone or mixed with wheat; in England principally as food for cattle,\r\nespecially for sheep and lambs, when other food is scarce in winter.\r\nRye yields a strong spirit when distilled.\r\n\r\n     _Distilled_, subjected to distillation--the operation of\r\n     extracting spirit from a substance by evaporation and\r\n     condensation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what country is the Potato a native?\r\n\r\nPotatoes grew wild in Peru, a country of South America; whence they\r\nwere transplanted to other parts of the American continent, and\r\nafterwards to Europe. The honor of introducing this useful vegetable\r\ninto England is divided between Sir Francis Drake, in 1580, and Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh, in 1586, some ascribing it to the former, and others\r\nto the latter. It is certain they were obtained from Virginia in the\r\ntime of Raleigh; they were cultivated only in the gardens of the\r\nnobility, and were reckoned a great delicacy. They now constitute a\r\nprincipal article of food in most of the countries of Europe and\r\nAmerica; in Ireland, they have long furnished nearly four-fifths of\r\nthe entire food of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat part of the plant is eaten?\r\n\r\nThe root, which, when roasted or boiled, affords a wholesome and\r\nagreeable meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Tea?\r\n\r\nThe leaves of an evergreen shrub, a native of China and Japan, in\r\nwhich countries alone it is extensively cultivated for use. The\r\ntea-plant was at one time introduced into South Carolina, where its\r\nculture appears to have been attended with but little success. It may\r\nyet become a staple production of some portions of the United States.\r\n\r\n     _Evergreen_, retaining its leaves fresh and green through\r\n     all seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is it prepared for use?\r\n\r\nBy carefully gathering the leaves, one by one, while they are yet\r\nsmall, young, and juicy. They are then spread on large flat iron pans,\r\nand placed over small furnaces, when they are constantly shifted by\r\nthe hand till they become too hot to be borne.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is next done?\r\n\r\nThey are then removed with a kind of shovel resembling a fan, and\r\npoured on mats, whence they are taken in small quantities, and rolled\r\nin the palm of the hand always in one direction, until they cool and\r\nretain the curl.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow often is this operation repeated?\r\n\r\nTwo or three times, the furnace each time being made less hot. The tea\r\nis then placed in the store-houses, or packed in chests, and sent to\r\nmost of the countries in Europe and America.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the appearance of the Tea-tree.\r\n\r\nThe Tea-tree when arrived at its full growth, which it does in about\r\nseven years, is about a man\'s height; the green leaves are narrow, and\r\njagged all round; the flower resembles that of the wild rose, but is\r\nsmaller. The shrub loves to grow in valleys, at the foot of mountains,\r\nand on the banks of rivers where it enjoys a southern exposure to the\r\nsun; though it endures considerable variation of heat and cold, as it\r\nflourishes in the northern clime of Pekin, where the winter is often\r\nsevere; and also about Canton, where the heat is sometimes very great.\r\nThe best tea, however, grows in a temperate climate, the country about\r\nNankin producing better tea than either Pekin or Canton, between which\r\ntwo places it is situated.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat produces the difference between Green and Bohea, or Black?\r\n\r\nThere are varieties of the plant, and the difference of the tea arises\r\nfrom the mode of preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat nation first introduced it into Europe?\r\n\r\nThe Dutch in 1610; it was introduced into England in 1650\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Coffee?\r\n\r\nThe berry of the coffee-tree, a native of Arabia. The coffee-tree is\r\nan evergreen, and makes a beautiful appearance at all times of the\r\nyear, but especially when in flower, and when the berries are red,\r\nwhich is usually during the winter. It is also cultivated in Persia,\r\nthe East Indies, Liberia on the coast of Africa, the West Indies,\r\nBrazil and other parts of South America, as well as in most tropical\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\n     _Tropical_, being within the tropics, that is, in the Torrid\r\n     Zone.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was the original discoverer of Coffee, for the drink of man?\r\n\r\nIt is not exactly known: the earliest written accounts of the use of\r\nCoffee are by Arabian writers in the 15th century; it appears that in\r\nthe city of Aden it became, in the latter half of that century, a very\r\npopular drink, first with lawyers, studious persons, and those whose\r\noccupation required wakefulness at night, and soon after, with all\r\nclasses. Its use gradually extended to other cities, and to those on\r\nthe eastern shores of the Mediterranean. Towards the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, it was carried to Batavia where it was soon\r\nextensively planted, and at last young trees were sent to the\r\nbotanical garden at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho introduced it into France and England?\r\n\r\nThevenot, the traveller, brought it into France, and a Greek servant\r\nnamed Pasqua (taken to England by Mr. Daniel Edwards, a Turkey\r\nmerchant, in 1652, to make his coffee,) first set up the profession of\r\ncoffee-man, and introduced the drink among the English.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is it prepared?\r\n\r\nThe berries are roasted in a revolving metallic cylinder, till they\r\nare of a deep brown color, and then ground to powder, and boiled.\r\n\r\n     _Metallic_, consisting of metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Chocolate?\r\n\r\nA kind of cake or paste, made of the kernel of the cacao-nut.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the Cacao-nut Tree.\r\n\r\nIt resembles the cherry tree, and grows to the height of fifteen or\r\nsixteen feet. The cacao-nut tree bears leaves, flowers, and fruit, all\r\nthe year through.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere does it grow?\r\n\r\nIn tropical regions, where it is largely cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what form is the fruit?\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat like a cucumber, about three inches round, and of a\r\nyellowish red color. It contains from ten to forty seeds, each covered\r\nwith a little rind, of a violet color; when this is stripped off, the\r\nkernel, of which they make the chocolate, is visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do they make it into a drink?\r\n\r\nBy boiling it with water or milk. There are various newly-invented\r\nways of preparing chocolate, so that it may be made in a few minutes,\r\nby only pouring boiling water upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCALICO, COTTON, CLOTH, WOOL, BAIZE, LINEN, FLAX, HEMP, DIAPER,\r\nHOLLAND, CANVAS, AND FLANNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Calico?\r\n\r\nA kind of printed cotton cloth, of different colors.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what place did it take its name?\r\n\r\nFrom Calicut, a city on the coast of Malabar, where it was first made;\r\nmuch is now manufactured in the United States, England, and many other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Cotton?\r\n\r\nA downy or woolly substance, enclosed in the pod, or seed-vessel, of\r\nthe cotton-plant. The commercial classification of cotton is\r\ndetermined--1, by cleanliness or freedom from sand, dry leaf, and\r\nother impurities; 2, by absence of color; both subject also to\r\ncharacter of staple, length, and strength and fineness of fibre. These\r\ntogether determine relative value. There are two general\r\nclassifications, long-stapled and short-stapled. Of the former the\r\nbest is the sea island cotton of the United States. The _short staple\r\ncotton_, grows in the middle and upper country; the long staple is\r\ncultivated in the lower country near the sea, and on the islands near\r\nthe coasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is it cultivated?\r\n\r\nThe seeds are sown in ridges made with the plough or hoe; when the\r\nplants are mature, the pods open, and the cotton is picked from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere did Cotton anciently grow, and for what was it used?\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, where it was used by the priests and sacrificers, for a very\r\nsingular kind of garment worn by them alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what manufacture is it now used?\r\n\r\nIt is woven into muslins, dimities, cloths, calicoes, &c.; and is\r\nalso joined with silks and flax, in the composition of other stuffs,\r\nand in working with the needle.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the Cotton separated from the seed?\r\n\r\nBy machines called _cotton gins_, of which there are two kinds; the\r\n_roller-gin_, and the _saw-gin_. In the former, the cotton, just as\r\ngathered from the plant, is drawn between two rollers, placed so\r\nclosely together as to permit the passage of the cotton, but not of\r\nthe seeds, which are consequently left behind. In the _saw-gin_, the\r\ncotton is placed in a receiver, one side of which consists of a\r\ngrating of parallel wires, about an eighth of an inch apart; circular\r\nsaws, revolving on a common axis between these wires, entangle in\r\ntheir teeth the cotton, and draw it from the seeds, which are too\r\nlarge to pass between the wires.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is it made into Calico, &c.?\r\n\r\nThe cotton having been separated from the seed, is spun by a machine\r\nfor the purpose. It is next woven, then dressed, and printed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Cloth?\r\n\r\nThe word, in its general sense, includes all kinds of stuffs woven in\r\nthe loom, whether the threads be of wool, cotton, hemp, or flax.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what is it more particularly applied?\r\n\r\nTo a web or tissue of woollen threads.\r\n\r\n     _Web_, any thing woven.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Wool?\r\n\r\nThe covering or hair of sheep. To prepare it for the weaver, it is\r\nfirst shorn, washed, and dried, then carded or combed by machinery\r\ninto fibres or threads: formerly this was always performed by the\r\nhand, by means of an instrument, called a comb, with several rows of\r\npointed teeth; this, though not much used now, is still occasionally\r\nemployed, except in large factories. This combing is repeated two or\r\nthree times, till it is sufficiently smooth and even for spinning.\r\nSpinning or converting wool, or cotton, silk, &c. into thread, was\r\nanciently performed by the distaff and spindle: these we find\r\nmentioned in sacred history, and they have been used in all ages, and\r\nin all countries yet discovered. The natives of India, and of some\r\nother parts of the world, still employ this simple invention.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the next improvement?\r\n\r\nThe invention of the hand-wheel. In 1767, a machine called the\r\nspinning-jenny was invented by a weaver named Hargreaves; but the\r\ngreatest improvement in the art of spinning was effected by Mr.\r\nArkwright, in 1768: these two inventions were combined, and again\r\nimproved upon in 1776; so that by the new plan, the material can be\r\nconverted into thread in a considerably shorter space of time than in\r\nthe ancient mode; leaving to man merely to feed the machine, and join\r\nthe threads when they break. The sheep, whose wool forms the material\r\nfor nearly all woollen clothing, came originally from Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes weaving differ according to the material used?\r\n\r\nThe principle of weaving is the same in every kind of fabric, and\r\nconsists in forming any kind of thread into a flat web, or cloth, by\r\ninterlacing one thread with another; the various appearances of the\r\nmanufacture arise as much from the modes in which the threads are\r\ninterwoven, as from the difference of material.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not the employment of Wool in the manufacture of Clothing of great\r\nantiquity?\r\n\r\nIn the earliest records we possess of the arts of mankind, wool is\r\nmentioned as forming a chief article in the manufacture of clothing;\r\nit is spoken of in the Bible, as a common material for cloth, as early\r\nas the time of Moses. The ancient Greeks and Romans are well known to\r\nhave possessed this art. At the beginning of the thirteenth century,\r\nthe manufacture was established in many parts of Europe, particularly\r\nin Spain, from which country it extended itself to France and Italy.\r\nThere is no doubt that it was introduced into England by its\r\nconquerors the Romans, a manufactory being established at Winchester,\r\nsufficiently large to supply the Roman army.\r\n\r\n     _Manufactory_, a place where things are made or\r\n     manufactured; derived from the Latin _manus_, a hand, and\r\n     the verb _facio_, to do or make.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat circumstance contributed to the progress of this manufacture\r\namong the English?\r\n\r\nIn 1330, the English, being desirous of improving their woollen\r\nmanufacture, invited over the Flemings, by the offer of various\r\nprivileges, to establish manufactories there. The skill of these\r\npeople soon effected a great improvement in the English fabrics, so\r\nthat there no longer remained any occasion for the exportation of\r\nEnglish wool into Flanders, to be manufactured into fine cloth; and a\r\nlaw was passed by the government to forbid it. Both the cotton and\r\nwoollen manufactures have, of late years, arisen to great importance\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat country affords the best Wool?\r\n\r\nThe wool of Germany is most esteemed at the present day: that of Spain\r\nwas formerly the most valuable, but the Spanish breed of sheep, having\r\nbeen introduced into Germany, succeeded better there than in Spain,\r\nand increased so rapidly, that the Spanish wool trade has greatly\r\ndiminished. Australia is one of the principal wool-growing countries\r\nin the world, for the breed of sheep sent out to that country and\r\nTasmania has succeeded remarkably well.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat part of the world is meant by Australia?\r\n\r\nA British Island in the South Pacific Ocean, comprising the Colonies\r\nof Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western\r\nAustralia. It is the principal of the group of large islands, in the\r\nOriental Archipelago. Tasmania is another of the same group, separated\r\nfrom New South Wales by a channel called Bass\'s Strait, and also\r\nbelongs to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by an Archipelago?\r\n\r\nA part of a sea studded with numerous islands; but the term is more\r\nparticularly applied to that lying between Europe and Asia, which\r\ncontains the Greek Islands. The word is a corruption from the Greek,\r\nsignifying the \xc3\x86gean Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the Wool of the sheep all of one quality?\r\n\r\nNo; it varies according to the species of sheep, the soil on which\r\nthey are fed, and the part of the animal from which it is taken: the\r\nchief distinction is between the long and the short wool; the long\r\nwool is employed in the manufacture of carpets, crapes, blankets, &c.;\r\nand the finer and shorter sorts for hosiery, broadcloths &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere were Carpets originally made?\r\n\r\nCarpets are of oriental origin, and are made of different sorts of\r\nstuffs; they are woven in a variety of ways. Persian and Turkey\r\ncarpets are most esteemed; they are woven in a piece, in looms of a\r\nvery simple construction. Formerly the manufacture of these carpets\r\nwas confined to Persia and Turkey; but they are now successfully made,\r\nboth in Europe and the United States, &c. Great Britain is the\r\nprincipal seat of the carpet manufacture of the world. Brussels,\r\nWilton, and Kidderminster carpets derive their names from the places\r\nwhere they were invented.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not the art of weaving very ancient?\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been known from a period as early as the time of\r\nAbraham and Jacob; its inventor is not known, but it is possible that\r\nmen took a lesson from the ingenious spider, which weaves its web\r\nafter the same manner. The ancient Egyptians appear to have brought it\r\nto great perfection, and were even acquainted with the art of\r\ninterweaving colors after the manner of the Scottish plaid.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Baize?\r\n\r\nA coarse, open, woollen stuff, with a long nap. It is chiefly made in\r\nthe United States, England, France, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Linen?\r\n\r\nThere are various kinds of linen, made from cotton, flax, and hemp;\r\nbut the term is chiefly applied to that woven with the two last\r\nmentioned. Linen means cloth of flax; hence its derivation from the\r\nLatin word _linum_, flax.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Flax?\r\n\r\nAn annual plant, the fibres of which are beaten into threads, spun,\r\nand afterwards woven into linen; it is extensively cultivated in the\r\nUnited States, Russia, and some other countries of Europe. Hemp is a\r\nplant of a similar nature, equally used with flax, in the manufacture\r\nof linens. Russian hemp is cultivated to a larger extent than that of\r\nany other country, and is considered the best that is grown.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long has the use of Hemp and Flax been known?\r\n\r\nThose plants are said to be natives of Persia, and introduced from\r\nsome parts of the East into Europe, over which it is now widely\r\ndistributed: it existed both in a wild and cultivated state, in some\r\nparts of Russia, as early as five centuries before Christ These\r\nproducts form a considerable article of exportation, besides the\r\nquantity used in Russia itself; a considerable part is wrought into\r\nlinens, diapers, canvas, and other manufactures; and even the seeds\r\nare exported, both in their natural state and as oil. In various parts\r\nof Russia, hemp-seed oil and flax-seed (or linseed) oil are prepared\r\nin very large quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Diaper?\r\n\r\nA sort of linen cloth, woven in flowers, and other figures; it is said\r\nto have received its name from d\'Iper, now Ypres, a town of Belgium,\r\nsituated on a river of the same name, where it was first made.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Holland?\r\n\r\nA fine, close, even, linen cloth, used for sheets, &c. It obtained its\r\nname from being principally made in Holland.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Canvas?\r\n\r\nA hempen cloth, so loosely woven as to leave interstices between the\r\nthreads, in little squares. It is used for working in patterns upon it\r\nwith wools, &c.; by painters for a ground work on which they draw\r\ntheir pictures; for tents, sails, and many other purposes. There are\r\nseveral sorts, varying in the fineness of their texture.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Damask?\r\n\r\nA sort of silken stuff, having some parts raised on its surface to\r\nrepresent flowers or figures. It took its name from Damascus, in\r\nSyria, whence it was first brought.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there not another sort of Damask?\r\n\r\nYes, made from linen; and so called because its large flowers resemble\r\nthose of damask roses. It was first made in Flanders, and is used for\r\ntable linen, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Flannel?\r\n\r\nA slight, loose, woollen stuff, used for warm clothing; it was\r\noriginally made in Wales, where it still continues to be manufactured\r\nin great perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCOCOA, TODDY, CHERRIES, BARK, CORK, COCHINEAL, CLOVES, CINNAMON,\r\nAND CASSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what form is the tree which bears those large nuts, called Cocoa\r\nnuts?\r\n\r\nIt is tall and straight, without branches, and generally about thirty\r\nor forty feet high; at the top are twelve leaves, ten feet long, and\r\nhalf a foot broad; above the leaves, grows a large excrescence in the\r\nform of a cabbage, excellent to eat, but taking it off kills the tree.\r\nThe cocoa is a species of Palm.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not the Indian liquor called Toddy, produced from the Cocoa Tree?\r\n\r\nYes, between the leaves and the top arise several shoots about the\r\nthickness of a man\'s arm, which, when cut, distil a white, sweet,\r\nand agreeable liquor; while this liquor exudes, the tree yields no\r\nfruit; but when the shoots are allowed to grow, it puts out a large\r\ncluster or branch, on which the cocoa nuts hang, to the number of ten\r\nor twelve.\r\n\r\n     _Distil_, to let fall in drops.\r\n\r\n     _Exude_, to force or throw out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL OF MILAN, ITALY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow often does this tree produce nuts?\r\n\r\nThree times a year, the nuts being about the size of a man\'s head, and\r\nof an oval form.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what countries is it a native?\r\n\r\nOf Asia, the Indies, Africa, Arabia, the Islands of the Southern\r\nPacific, and the hottest parts of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the uses of this Tree?\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the tree are made into baskets; they are also used for\r\nthatching houses: the fibrous bark of the nut, and the trunk of the\r\ntree, are made into cordage, sails, and cloth; the shell, into\r\ndrinking bowls and cups; the kernel affords a wholesome food, and the\r\nmilk contained in the shell, a cooling liquor.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what country was the Cherry Tree first brought?\r\n\r\nFrom Cerasus, a city of Pontus, in Asia, on the southern borders of\r\nthe Black Sea; from which place this tree was brought to Rome, in the\r\nyear of that city 680, by Lucullus; it was conveyed, a hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight years after, into Great Britain, A.D. 55.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of A.D.?\r\n\r\nA short way of writing Anno Domini, Latin words for _in the year of\r\nour Lord_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Lucullus?\r\n\r\nA renowned Roman general.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the wood of the Cherry Tree useful?\r\n\r\nIt is used in cabinet-making, for boxes, and other articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Bark?\r\n\r\nThe exterior part of trees, which serves them as a skin or covering.\r\n\r\n     _Exterior_, the outside.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes it not undergo some change during the year?\r\n\r\nEach year the bark of a tree divides, and distributes itself two\r\ncontrary ways, the outer part gives towards the skin, till it becomes\r\nskin itself, and at length falls off; the inner part is added to the\r\nwood. The bark is to the body of a tree, what the skin of our body is\r\nto the flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what use is Bark?\r\n\r\nBark is useful for many things: of the bark of willows and linden\r\ntrees, ropes are sometimes made. The Siamese make their cordage of the\r\ncocoa tree bark, as do most of the Asiatic and African nations; in the\r\nEast Indies, they make the bark of a certain tree into a kind of\r\ncloth; some are used in medicines, as the Peruvian bark for Quinine;\r\nothers in dyeing, as that of the alder; others in spicery, as\r\ncinnamon, &c.; the bark of oak, in tanning; that of a kind of birch is\r\nused by the Indians for making canoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Canoes?\r\n\r\nBoats used by savages; they are made chiefly of the trunks of trees\r\ndug hollow; and sometimes of pieces of bark fastened together.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do the savages guide them?\r\n\r\nWith paddles, or oars; they seldom carry sails, and the loading is\r\nlaid in the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre not the savages very dexterous in the management of them?\r\n\r\nYes, extremely so; they strike the paddles with such regularity, that\r\nthe canoes seem to fly along the surface of the water; at the same\r\ntime balancing the vessels with their bodies, to prevent their\r\noverturning.\r\n\r\n     _Dexterous_, expert, nimble.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo they leave their canoes in the water on their return from a voyage?\r\n\r\nNo, they draw them ashore, hang them up by the two ends, and leave\r\nthem to dry; they are generally so light as to be easily carried from\r\nplace to place.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere not books once made of Bark?\r\n\r\nYes, the ancients wrote their books on the barks of many trees, as on\r\nthose of the ash and the lime tree, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich part did they use?\r\n\r\nNot the exterior or outer bark, but the inner and finer, which is of\r\nso durable a texture, that there are manuscripts written on it which\r\nare still extant, though more than a thousand years old.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it not also used in Manure?\r\n\r\nYes, especially that of the oak; but the best oak bark is used in\r\ntanning.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Cork?\r\n\r\nThe thick, spongy, external bark of the Cork Tree, a species of oak.\r\nThere are two varieties of this tree, the broad-leaved and the narrow:\r\nit is an evergreen, and grows to the height of thirty feet. The Cork\r\nTree attains to a very great age.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is the Tree found?\r\n\r\nIn Spain, Italy, France, and many other countries. The true cork is\r\nthe produce of the broad-leaved tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are its uses?\r\n\r\nCork is employed in various ways, but especially for stopping vessels\r\ncontaining liquids, and, on account of its buoyancy in water, in the\r\nconstruction of life boats. It is also used in the manufacture of life\r\npreservers and cork jackets. The greatest quantities are brought from\r\nCatalonia, in Spain. The uses of Cork were well known to the ancients.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what particular use did the Egyptians put it?\r\n\r\nThey made coffins of it, lined with a resinous composition, which\r\npreserved the bodies of the dead uncorrupted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Cochineal?\r\n\r\nA drug used by the dyers, for dyeing crimsons and scarlets; and for\r\nmaking carmine, a brilliant red used in painting, and several of the\r\narts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it a plant?\r\n\r\nNo, it is an insect. The form of the Cochineal is oval; it is about\r\nthe size of a small pea, and has six legs armed with claws, and a\r\ntrunk by which it sucks its nourishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is its habitation?\r\n\r\nIt breeds in a fruit resembling a pear; the plant which bears it is\r\nabout five or six feet high; at the top of the fruit grows a red\r\nflower, which when full blown, falls upon it; the fruit then appears\r\nfull of little red insects, having very small wings. These are the\r\nCochineals.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow are they caught?\r\n\r\nBy spreading a cloth under the plant, and shaking it with poles, till\r\nthe insects quit it and fly about, which they cannot do many minutes,\r\nbut soon tumble down dead into the cloth; where they are left till\r\nquite dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the insect change its color when it is dead?\r\n\r\nWhen the insect flies, it is red; when it is fallen, black; and when\r\nfirst dried, it is greyish; it afterwards changes to a purplish grey,\r\npowdered over with a kind of white dust.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what countries is the Cochineal brought?\r\n\r\nFrom the West Indies, Jamaica, Mexico, and other parts of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Cloves?\r\n\r\nThe dried flower-buds of the Clove Tree, anciently a native of the\r\nMoluccas; but afterwards transplanted by the Dutch (who traded in\r\nthem,) to other islands, particularly that of Ternate. It is now found\r\nin most of the East Indian Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the Clove Tree.\r\n\r\nIt is a large handsome tree of the myrtle kind; its leaves resemble\r\nthose of the laurel. Though the Clove Tree is cultivated to a great\r\nextent, yet, so easily does the fruit on falling take root, that it\r\nthus multiplies itself, in many instances, without the trouble of\r\nculture. The clove when it first begins to appear is white, then\r\ngreen, and at last hard and red; when dried, it turns yellow, and then\r\ndark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are its qualities?\r\n\r\nThe Clove is the hottest, and most acrid of aromatic substances; one\r\nof our most wholesome spices, and of great use in medicine; it also\r\nyields an abundance of oil, which is much used by perfumers, and in\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n     _Acrid_, of a hot, biting taste.\r\n\r\n     _Aromatic_, fragrant, having an agreeable odor.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Cinnamon?\r\n\r\nAn agreeable, aromatic spice, the bark of a tree of the laurel kind;\r\nthe Cinnamon tree grows in the Southern parts of India; but most\r\nabundantly in the island of Ceylon, where it is extensively\r\ncultivated; its flowers are white, resembling those of the lilac in\r\nform, and are very fragrant; they are borne in large clusters. The\r\ntree sends up numerous shoots the third or fourth year after it has\r\nbeen planted; these shoots are planted out, when nearly an inch in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the bark procured?\r\n\r\nBy stripping it off from these shoots, after they have been cut down;\r\nthe trees planted for the purpose of obtaining cinnamon, throw out a\r\ngreat number of branches, apparently from the same root, and are not\r\nallowed to rise higher than ten feet; but in its native uncultivated\r\nstate, the cinnamon tree usually rises to the height of twenty or\r\nthirty feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the Cinnamon Tree cultivated?\r\n\r\nBy seed, sown during the rains; from shoots cut from large trees; and\r\nby transplanting old stumps. The cinnamon tree, in its wild state, is\r\nsaid to be propagated by means of a kind of pigeons, that feed on its\r\nfruit; in carrying which to their nests, the seeds fall out, and,\r\ndropping in various places, take root, spring up, and become trees.\r\n\r\n     _Propagated_, spread, extended, multiplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat else is obtained from this tree?\r\n\r\nThe bark, besides being used as a spice, yields an oil highly\r\nesteemed, both as a medicine and as a perfume; the fruit by boiling\r\nalso produces an oil, used by the natives for burning in lamps; as\r\nsoon as it hardens, it becomes a solid substance like wax, and is\r\nformed into candles. Camphor is extracted from the root. Cassia is\r\ncinnamon of an inferior kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nBOMBAZINE, CRAPE, CAMLET, CAMBRIC, LACE, SILK, VELVET, AND\r\nMOHAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Bombazine?\r\n\r\nA stuff composed of silk and wool woven together in a loom. It was\r\nfirst made at Milan, and thence sent abroad; great quantities are now\r\nmade in England and other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Milan situated?\r\n\r\nIn Italy, and is noted for its cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what is Bombazine used?\r\n\r\nFor dresses. Black bombazine is worn entirely for mourning. The\r\noriginal bombazine has, however, become much less used than formerly,\r\non account of the numerous newly-invented fabrics of finer or coarser\r\nqualities, composed of the same materials mixed in various degrees, as\r\nMousselines de laine, Challis, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Crape?\r\n\r\nA light, transparent stuff, resembling gauze, made of raw silk very\r\nloosely woven, or of wool; by raw silk is meant, silk in the state in\r\nwhich it is taken from the silk worm.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere was Crape first made?\r\n\r\nAt Bologna, a city of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat city of France was long celebrated for its manufacture?\r\n\r\nLyons, the second city of France, where there are large silk\r\nmanufactories. Great quantities are also made in England, principally\r\nin the city of Norwich, which has long been distinguished for the\r\nbeauty of its crapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Camlet?\r\n\r\nA stuff made sometimes of wool, sometimes of silk and hair, especially\r\nthat of goats. The oriental camlet is made of the pure hair of a sort\r\nof goat, a native of Angora, a city of Natolia, in Turkey. The\r\nEuropean camlets are made of a mixture of woollen thread and hair.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat countries are most noted for them?\r\n\r\nEngland, France, Holland, and Flanders; the city of Brussels, in\r\nBelgium, exceeds them all in the beauty and quality of its camlets;\r\nthose of England are the next.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Cambric?\r\n\r\nA species of linen made of flax; it is very fine and white.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom whence did it take its name?\r\n\r\nFrom Cambray, a large and celebrated city of French Flanders, where it\r\nwas first made; it is now made at other places in France; and also in\r\nEngland, Scotland, Ireland, the United States, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Lace?\r\n\r\nA work composed of many threads of fine linen or silk, interwoven one\r\nwith another according to some particular pattern. Belgium, France,\r\nand England are the principal countries in which this manufacture is\r\ncarried on; vast quantities of the finest laces were formerly made in\r\nFlanders.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what is Silk produced?\r\n\r\nFrom the silk-worm, an insect not more remarkable for the precious\r\nmatter it furnishes, than for the many forms it assumes before and\r\nafter it envelopes itself in the beautiful ball, the silken threads of\r\nwhich form the elegant texture which is so much worn.\r\n\r\n     _Texture_, a web or substance woven.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the habits of this insect, and on what does it feed?\r\n\r\nAfter bursting from the egg, it becomes a large worm or caterpillar of\r\na yellowish white color, (which is its first state;) this caterpillar\r\nfeeds on the leaves of the mulberry tree, till, arriving at maturity,\r\nit winds itself up in a silken bag or case, called a cocoon, about the\r\nsize and shape of a pigeon\'s egg, and becomes a chrysalis; in which\r\nstate it lies without signs of life; in about ten days it eats its way\r\nout of its case, a perfect butterfly, which lays a number of eggs and\r\nthen dies. In the warmth of the summer weather, these eggs are\r\nhatched, and become worms, as their parents did at first.\r\n\r\n     _Maturity_, ripeness, perfection\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much silk is each ball said to contain?\r\n\r\nEach ball consists of a very fine, soft, bright, delicate thread,\r\nwhich being wound off, extends in length six miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by Chrysalis?\r\n\r\nThe second state into which the insect passes before it comes to be a\r\nbutterfly. The maggot or worm having ceased to eat, fixes itself in\r\nsome place till its skin separates, and discovers a horny, oblong\r\nbody, which is the chrysalis.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere was Silk first made?\r\n\r\nThe culture and manufacture of silk was originally confined to China.\r\nThe Greeks, under Alexander the Great, brought home, among other\r\nEastern luxuries, wrought silks from Persia, about 323, B.C.\r\nIt was not long unknown to the Romans, although it was so rare, that\r\nit was even sold weight for weight with gold. The Emperor Aurelian,\r\nwho died in 275, B.C. refused the Empress, his wife, a suit\r\nof silk which she solicited with much earnestness, merely on account\r\nof its dearness. Heliogabalus, the Emperor, who died half a century\r\nbefore Aurelian, was the first who wore a _holosericum_ or garment all\r\nof silk.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho introduced the Silk Worm itself into Europe?\r\n\r\nTwo monks, engaged as missionaries in China, obtained a quantity of\r\nsilk worms\' eggs, which they concealed in a hollow cane, and conveyed\r\nin safety to Constantinople in 552; the eggs were hatched in the\r\nproper season by the warmth of manure, and the worms fed with the\r\nleaves of the wild mulberry tree. These worms in due time spun their\r\nsilk, and propagated under the care of the monks, who also instructed\r\nthe Romans in the whole process of manufacturing their production.\r\nFrom the insects thus produced, proceeded all the silk worms which\r\nhave since been reared in Europe, and the western parts of Asia. The\r\nmulberry tree was then eagerly planted, and on this, their natural\r\nfood, they were successfully reared in Greece; and the manufacture was\r\nestablished at Thebes, Athens, and Corinth, in particular. The\r\nVenetians, soon after this time commencing a trade with the Greeks,\r\nsupplied all the Western parts of Europe with silks for many\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere were the cities of Thebes and Athens situated?\r\n\r\nThebes was an ancient city of Beotia, in Greece, founded by Cadmus, a\r\nPhenician, though of Egyptian parentage. Sailing from the coast of\r\nPhenicia, he arrived in Beotia, and built the city, calling it Thebes,\r\nfrom the city of that name in Egypt. To this prince is ascribed the\r\ninvention of sixteen letters of the Greek Alphabet. Athens was the\r\ncapital of Attica, founded by Cecrops, an Egyptian. It was the seat of\r\nlearning and the arts, and has produced some of the most celebrated\r\nwarriors, statesmen, orators, poets, and sculptors in the world. Since\r\nthe emancipation of Greece from the cruel bondage of its conquerors\r\nthe Turks, who had oppressed it for three centuries, Athens has been\r\nchosen as its capital, and is still a considerable town adorned with\r\nsplendid ruins of the beautiful buildings it once possessed. Thebes\r\nand Corinth, another celebrated city, are now only villages.\r\n\r\n     _Warrior_, a soldier.\r\n\r\n     _Statesmen_, men versed in the arts of government.\r\n\r\n     _Orator_, a public speaker.\r\n\r\n     _Poet_, one who composes poetry.\r\n\r\n     _Sculptor_, one who cuts figures in stone, marble, or ivory.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the Venetians?\r\n\r\nInhabitants of Venice, a city of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid this manufacture continue to be confined to the Greeks and\r\nVenetians?\r\n\r\nBy no means. The rest of Italy, and Spain, by degrees learnt the art\r\nfrom some manufactories in Sicily; and about the reign of Francis the\r\nFirst, the French became masters of it. It, however, long remained a\r\nrarity; their King, Henry the Second, is supposed to have worn the\r\nfirst pair of knit silk stockings. The Fourth Henry encouraged the\r\nplanting of mulberry trees; his successors also did the same, and the\r\nproduce of silk in France is now very considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen was the manufacture of silk introduced into England?\r\n\r\nThere was a company of silk women in England as early as the year\r\n1455; but they probably were merely employed in needlework of silk and\r\nthread, for Italy supplied England with the broad manufacture during\r\nthe chief part of the fifteenth century. The great advantage this new\r\nmanufacture afforded, made King James the First very desirous for its\r\nintroduction into England, particularly in 1608, when it was\r\nrecommended, in very earnest terms, to plant mulberry trees for the\r\nrearing of silk worms; but unhappily without effect. However, towards\r\nthe latter end of this reign, the broad silk manufacture was\r\nintroduced, and with great success. The revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes contributed greatly to its promotion, by the number of French\r\nworkmen who took refuge in England; to them the English are indebted\r\nfor the art of manufacturing many elegant kinds of silks, satins,\r\nvelvets, &c., which had formerly been imported from abroad up to the\r\nyear 1718. The silk manufacture has also been successfully introduced\r\ninto some portions of the United States.\r\n\r\n     _Revocation_, act of recalling, repeal.\r\n\r\n     _Imported_, brought into.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the Edict of Nantes?\r\n\r\nA law made in favor of the Protestants, the repealing of which drove\r\nmany of their most skilful workmen to take refuge in England. They\r\nwere kindly received, and settled in Spitalfields, and many other\r\nparts of England as well as Ireland, where they carried on a\r\nflourishing and ingenious manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere the attempts to rear Silk Worms in England successful?\r\n\r\nNo; after many trials, all of which failed, attention was directed to\r\nthe establishments for procuring both raw and wrought silks, in the\r\nsettlements in India belonging to Britain; this was attended with\r\ncomplete success, the climate being extremely favorable, and the price\r\nof labor cheap. Raw silk is imported in quantities from India, China,\r\nItaly, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the Silk taken from the Worm?\r\n\r\nThe people who are employed in the care of these insects collect the\r\ngolden balls from off the mulberry trees, (to the leaves of which the\r\ninsects glue their silk) and put them into warm water, that the\r\nthreads may unfasten and wind off more easily; having taken off the\r\ncoarse woolly part which covers the balls, they take twelve or\r\nfourteen threads at a time, and wind them off into skeins. In order to\r\nprepare this beautiful material for the hand of the weaver to be\r\nwrought into silks, stuffs, brocades, satins, velvets, ribbons, &c.,\r\nit is spun, reeled, milled, bleached, and dyed.\r\n\r\n     _Milled_, worked in a kind of mill.\r\n\r\n     _Bleached_, whitened.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Velvet?\r\n\r\nA rich kind of stuff, all silk, covered on the outside with a close,\r\nshort, fine, soft shag; the wrong side being very strong and close.\r\nThe principal number, and the best velvets, were made in France and\r\nItaly; others in Holland; they are now brought to great perfection in\r\nEngland. An inferior kind is made by mixing cotton with the silk.\r\nVelvet has been known in Europe for some centuries, but its\r\nmanufacture was long confined to some of the chief cities of Italy.\r\nFrom that country the French learned the art, and greatly improved it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence is the word Velvet derived?\r\n\r\nFrom the Italian word _velluto_, signifying velvet, which comes from\r\n_vellus_, hair or fleece.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Mohair?\r\n\r\nThe hair of a kind of goat, common about Angora, in Turkey. It is used\r\nin the manufacture of various kinds of stuffs, shawls, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there not another animal much celebrated for the material it\r\nfurnishes in the making of shawls?\r\n\r\nYes; the Thibet goat. The wool is sent to Cashmere, where it is spun\r\nand dyed. Cashmere is situated in the north-west extremity of India,\r\nand has long been celebrated for the beautiful and valuable shawls\r\nbearing its name which are manufactured there. The goats are beautiful\r\ncreatures, with long, fine, wavy hair, reaching nearly to the ground,\r\nso as almost to conceal their legs. The material of which the shawls\r\nare made is a fine silky down, which grows under the long hair, next\r\nto the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCURRANTS, RAISINS, FIGS, RICE, SUGAR, SUGAR CANDY, &C., SAGO,\r\nMILLET, GINGER, NUTMEG, MACE, PIMENTO OR ALLSPICE, PEPPER, AND CAYENNE\r\nPEPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Currants?\r\n\r\nA kind of small raisins or dried grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence are they brought?\r\n\r\nFrom several islands of the Archipelago, particularly Zante and\r\nCephalonia; and from the Isthmus of Corinth, in Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo they grow on bushes like our Currants?\r\n\r\nNo, on vines like other grapes, except that the leaves are somewhat\r\nthicker, and the grapes much smaller: they have no pips, and are of a\r\ndeep red, or rather black color.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen are they gathered, and how are they dried?\r\n\r\nThey are gathered in August, and laid on the ground in heaps till dry;\r\nthey are then cleaned, and put into magazines, from which they are\r\ntaken and packed in barrels for exportation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by Exportation?\r\n\r\nThe act of conveying goods for sale from one country to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Raisins?\r\n\r\nGrapes prepared by drying them in the sun, or by the heat of an oven.\r\nRaisins of Damascus, so called from the capital city of Syria, near\r\nwhich they are cultivated, are very large, flat, and wrinkled on the\r\nsurface; soft and juicy inside, and nearly an inch long. Raisins of\r\nthe sun, or jar raisins, so called from being imported in jars, are\r\nall dried by the heat of the sun; they are of a reddish blue color,\r\nand are the produce of Spain, whence the finest and best raisins are\r\nbrought. There are several other sorts, named either from the place in\r\nwhich they grow, or the kind of grape of which they are made, as those\r\nof Malaga, Valencia, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what manner are they dried?\r\n\r\nThe common way of drying grapes for raisins, is to tie two or three\r\nbunches of them together while yet on the vine, and dip them into a\r\nlye made of hot wood-ashes, mixed with a little olive oil. This makes\r\nthem shrink and wrinkle: after this they are cut from the branches\r\nwhich supported them, but left on the vine for three or four days,\r\nseparated on sticks, in an upright position, to dry at leisure.\r\nDifferent modes, however, are adopted, according to the quality of the\r\ngrape. The commonest kinds are dried in hot ovens, but the best way is\r\nthat in which the grapes are cut when fully ripe, and dried by the\r\nheat of the sun, on a floor of hard earth or stone.\r\n\r\n     _Lye_, a liquor made from wood-ashes; of great use in\r\n     medicine, bleaching, sugar works, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Figs?\r\n\r\nA soft, luscious fruit, the produce of the fig-tree. The best figs are\r\nbrought from Turkey, but they are also imported from Italy, Spain, and\r\nthe southern part of France. The islands of the Archipelago yield an\r\ninferior sort in great abundance. In this country they are sometimes\r\nplanted in a warm situation in gardens, but, being difficult to ripen,\r\nthey do not arrive at perfection. The figs sent from abroad are dried\r\nby the heat of the sun, or in furnaces for the purpose.\r\n\r\n     _Luscious_, sweet to excess, cloying.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Rice?\r\n\r\nA useful and nutritious grain, cultivated in immense quantities in\r\nIndia, China, and most eastern countries; in the West Indies, Central\r\nAmerica, and the United States; and in southern Europe. It forms the\r\nprincipal food of the people of eastern and southern Asia, and is more\r\nextensively consumed than any other species of grain, not even\r\nexcepting wheat.\r\n\r\n     _Nutritious_, wholesome, good for food.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes it not require a great deal of moisture?\r\n\r\nYes, it is usually planted in moist soils, and near rivers, where the\r\nground can be overflowed after it is come up. The Chinese water their\r\nrice-fields by means of movable mills, placed as occasion requires,\r\nupon any part of the banks of a river; the water is raised in buckets\r\nto a proper height, and afterwards conveyed in channels to the\r\ndestined places.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Sugar?\r\n\r\nA sweet, agreeable substance, manufactured chiefly from the Sugar\r\nCane,[1] a native of the East and West Indies, South America and the\r\nSouth Sea Islands; it is much cultivated in all tropical countries.\r\nThe earliest authentic accounts of sugar, are about the time of the\r\nCrusades,[2] when it appears to have been purchased from the Saracens,\r\nand imported into Europe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Most of the sugar in Europe is made from beets.]\r\n[Footnote 2: See Chapter XVII., article Navigation.]\r\n\r\n     _Authentic_, true, certain.\r\n\r\n     _Crusades_, holy wars.\r\n\r\n     _Saracens_, Turks or Arabs.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is it prepared?\r\n\r\nThe canes are crushed between large rollers in a mill, and the juice\r\ncollected into a large vessel placed to receive it; it is then boiled,\r\nand placed in pans to cool, when it becomes imperfectly crystallized,\r\nin which state we use it. This is called raw or soft sugar: loaf\r\nsugar, or the hard white sugar, is the raw brown sugar, prepared by\r\nrefining it till all foreign matter is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the Sugar Cane the only vegetable that produces Sugar?\r\n\r\nAll vegetables contain more or less sugar, but the plant in which it\r\nmost abounds is the sugar-cane. In the United States, a large quantity\r\nof sugar is prepared from the sap of the Sugar Maple Tree. The trees\r\nare tapped at the proper season by a cut being made in the bark, and\r\nthe juice runs into a vessel placed to receive it; it is then prepared\r\nin the same manner as the juice of the sugar cane.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Sugar Candy?\r\n\r\nSugar purified and crystallized.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Barley Sugar?\r\n\r\nSugar boiled till it is brittle, and cast on a stone anointed with oil\r\nof sweet almonds, and then formed into twisted sticks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Sago?\r\n\r\nA substance prepared from the pith of the Sago Palm, which grows\r\nnaturally in various parts of Africa and the Indies. The pith, which\r\nis even eatable in its natural state, is taken from the trunk of the\r\ntree, and thrown into a vessel placed over a horse-hair sieve; water\r\nis then thrown over the mass, and the finer parts of the pith pass\r\nthrough the sieve; the liquor thus obtained is left to settle. The\r\nclear liquor is then drawn off, and what remains is formed into\r\ngrains by being passed through metal dishes, with numerous small\r\nholes; it is next dried by the action of heat, and in this state it is\r\nexported. The Sago Palm also produces sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Millet, and in what countries does it grow?\r\n\r\nMillet is an esculent grain, originally brought from the Eastern\r\ncountries. It is cultivated in many parts of Europe, but most\r\nextensively in Egypt, Syria, China, and Hindostan, whence we are\r\nfurnished with it, it being rarely cultivated among us, except as a\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n     _Esculent_, good for food.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what is Millet used?\r\n\r\nIt is in great request amongst the Germans for puddings; for which it\r\nis sometimes used amongst us. The Italians make loaves and cakes of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Ginger?\r\n\r\nThe root of a plant cultivated in the East and West Indies, and in\r\nAmerica; it is a native of South-eastern Asia and the adjoining\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe its nature and use.\r\n\r\nIt is a warm aromatic, much used in medicine and cookery. The Indians\r\neat the root when green as a salad, chopping it small with other\r\nherbs; they also make a candy of it with sugar. The ginger sold in the\r\nshops here is dried, which is done by placing the roots in the heat of\r\nthe sun or in ovens, after being dug out of the ground. Quantities not\r\nonly of the dried root, but also of the candied sugar, are imported.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Nutmegs?\r\n\r\nA delicate aromatic fruit or spice, brought from the East Indies. The\r\nnutmeg tree greatly resembles our pear tree, and produces a kind\r\nof nut, which bears the same name as the tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLASS BLOWING AT THE GLASS-WORKS, PITTSBURGH, PA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the appearance of the Nutmeg?\r\n\r\nIts form is round, and its smell agreeable. The nutmeg is inclosed\r\nin four different covers; the first, a thick fleshy coat, (like our\r\nwalnut,) which opens of itself when ripe; under this lies a thin\r\nreddish network, of an agreeable smell and aromatic taste, called\r\nmace; this wraps up the shell, which opens as the fruit grows. The\r\nshell is the third cover, which is hard, thin, and blackish; under\r\nthis is a greenish film of no use; and in the last you find the\r\nnutmeg, which is the kernel of the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are its uses?\r\n\r\nThe nutmeg is much used in our food, and is of excellent virtue as a\r\nmedicine. It also yields an oil of great fragrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the Mace used as a spice?\r\n\r\nYes, it is separated from the shell of the nutmeg, and dried in the\r\nsun. It is brought over in flakes of a yellow color, smooth and\r\nnet-like, as you see it in the shops. Its taste is warm, bitterish,\r\nand rather pungent; its smell, aromatic. It is used both in food and\r\nmedicine, as the nutmeg, and also yields an oil.\r\n\r\n     _Pungent_, of a hot, biting taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Pimento or Allspice?\r\n\r\nThe dried unripe berry or fruit of a tree growing in great abundance\r\nin Jamaica, particularly on the northern side of that island, on hilly\r\nspots, near the coast; it is also a native of both Indies. The Pimento\r\nTree is a West Indian species of Myrtle; it grows to the height of\r\ntwenty or thirty feet; the leaves are all of a deep, shining green,\r\nand the blossom consists of numerous branches of small, white,\r\naromatic flowers, which render its appearance very striking; there is\r\nscarcely in the vegetable world any tree more beautiful than a young\r\nPimento about the month of July, when it is in full bloom.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen is the time to gather the spice?\r\n\r\nAbout the month of September, not long after the blossoms are fallen,\r\nthe berries are gathered by the hand; one laborer on the tree,\r\nemployed in gathering the small branches, will give employment to\r\nthree below (who are generally women and children) in picking the\r\nberries. They are then spread out thinly, and exposed to the sun at\r\nits rising and setting for some days; when they begin to dry, they are\r\nfrequently winnowed, and laid on cloths to preserve them better from\r\nrain and dew; by this management they become wrinkled, and change from\r\ngreen to a deep reddish brown color. Great quantities are annually\r\nimported.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are its uses?\r\n\r\nIt forms a pleasant addition to flavor food; it also yields an\r\nagreeable essential oil, and is accounted the best and mildest of\r\ncommon spices.\r\n\r\n     _Essential_, pure; extracted so as to contain all the\r\n     virtues of the spice in a very small compass.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is it called Allspice?\r\n\r\nBecause it has been supposed to combine the flavor of cloves, nutmegs,\r\nand cinnamon; the French call it _round clove_, from its round shape,\r\nand the taste being somewhat like that spice.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Pepper?\r\n\r\nThe product of a creeping shrub, growing in several parts of the East\r\nIndies, Asia, and America.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what manner does Pepper grow, and what part of the shrub is used?\r\n\r\nPepper is the fruit of this shrub, and grows in bunches or clusters,\r\nat first green; as it ripens it becomes reddish, until having been\r\nexposed for some time to the heat of the sun, (or probably gathered\r\nbefore perfectly ripe,) it becomes black, as in the condition we have\r\nit. There are two sorts, the black and the white.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the White Pepper?\r\n\r\nThe white pepper is merely the black deprived of its outside skin. For\r\nthis purpose the finest red berries are selected, and put in baskets\r\nto steep, either in running water, or in pits dug for the purpose,\r\nnear the banks of rivers. Sometimes they are only buried in the\r\nground. In any of these situations, they swell and burst their skins,\r\nfrom which, when dry, they are carefully separated by rubbing between\r\nthe hands, or fanning.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Cayenne Pepper?\r\n\r\nThe dried fruit of a plant called bird pepper, a native of both\r\nIndies. It is more pungent than the other sorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nGLASS, MIRRORS, EARTHENWARE, PORCELAIN, NEEDLES, PINS, PAPER,\r\nPRINTING, PARCHMENT, AND VELLUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Glass?\r\n\r\nA transparent, solid, brittle, factitious body, produced by fusing\r\nsand with an alkali. The essential ingredients of glass are silex and\r\npotash, or soda; a few other substances are sometimes added. Silex is\r\nfound nearly pure in rock crystal, flint, and other varieties of\r\nquartz; for the manufacture of the better kinds of glass in this\r\ncountry, it is generally obtained from sand, especially the white sand\r\nof New Jersey.\r\n\r\n     _Factitious_, made by art, not found in a state of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Potash?\r\n\r\nThe saline matter obtained from the ashes of wood, by causing water to\r\npass through them; the water imbibes the salt, which is then obtained\r\nfrom it by evaporation. When purified by calcination, it is termed\r\npearlash. In countries where there are vast forests, as in America and\r\nRussia, it is manufactured on a very large scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you say of the origin of Glass?\r\n\r\nThe period of its invention is quite unknown. Pliny relates that some\r\nmerchants, driven by a storm to the coast of Phenicia, near the river\r\nBelus, made a large fire on the sand to dress some food, using as\r\nfuel some of the plant Kali, which grew there in great abundance; an\r\nimperfect glass was thus formed by the melting of the sand and ashes\r\ntogether. This production was picked up by a Syrian merchant, who,\r\nattracted by its great beauty, examined the cause of its origin, and,\r\nafter many attempts, succeeded in its manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Pliny?\r\n\r\nA celebrated Roman naturalist and historian.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt what place was Glass first made?\r\n\r\nSome authors mention Sidon in Syria, which became famous for glass and\r\nglass-houses; but others maintain that the first glass-houses noticed\r\nin history were built at Tyre; which, they add, was the only place\r\nwhere glass was made for many ages. It is certain that the art was\r\nknown to the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Phenicia?\r\n\r\nA sub-division of Syria in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is an author?\r\n\r\nA person who writes a book.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is signified by a glass-house?\r\n\r\nA building erected for the making and working of glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat countries had glass windows first?\r\n\r\nItaly, then France and England; they began to be common about the year\r\n1180.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what year, and where, was the making of glass bottles begun?\r\n\r\nIn 1557, in London. The first glass plates for mirrors and\r\ncoach-windows were made at Lambeth, in 1673.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Mirror?\r\n\r\nA body which exhibits the images of objects presented to it by\r\nreflection. The word mirror is more peculiarly used to signify a\r\nsmooth surface of glass, tinned and quicksilvered at the back,[3]\r\nwhich reflects the images of objects placed before it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See Chapter XII., article Mercury.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAre they a modern invention?\r\n\r\nThe use of mirrors is very ancient; mention is made of brazen mirrors\r\nor looking-glasses in Exodus, the 38th chapter and 8th verse. Some\r\nmodern commentators will not admit the mirrors themselves to have been\r\nof brass, but of glass set or framed in brass; but the most learned\r\namong the Jewish rabbins say that in those times the mirrors made use\r\nof by the Hebrew women in dressing their heads were of metal, and that\r\nthe devout women mentioned in this passage made presents to Moses of\r\nall their mirrors to make the brazen laver for the Tabernacle. It\r\nmight likewise be proved that the ancient Greeks made use of brazen\r\nmirrors, from many passages in the ancient poets.\r\n\r\n     _Commentators_, explainers of passages in the Bible, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Rabbins_, doctors among the Jews, their learned men or\r\n     teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat nation invented the large looking-glass plates now in use?\r\n\r\nThe French.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat city of Italy excelled all Europe for many years in the making of\r\nfine glass?\r\n\r\nVenice. The manufacture of fine glass was first introduced into\r\nEngland by Venetian artists in 1078.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what is Earthenware composed?\r\n\r\nOf clay, and those earths which are capable of being kneaded into a\r\npaste easily receiving any form, and acquiring solidity by exposure to\r\nfire: sand, chalk, and flint are likewise mixed with clay.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what manner is it formed into such a variety of shapes?\r\n\r\nThe flint or sand, and soft clay, are mixed together in various\r\nproportions for the different kinds of ware; this paste is afterwards\r\nbeaten till it becomes fit for being formed at the wheel into plates,\r\ndishes, basins, &c. These are then put into a furnace and baked; after\r\nwhich they are glazed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat nation so greatly excelled in the manufacture of a beautiful\r\nspecies of Earthenware?\r\n\r\nThe Chinese,--who, as far as can be ascertained, were its inventors.\r\nPorcelain is a fine sort of earthenware, chiefly made in China, whence\r\nit was called China or China-ware; it is also brought from many parts\r\nof the East, especially from Japan, Siam, Surat, and Persia. The art\r\nof making porcelain was one of those in which Europe had been excelled\r\nby oriental nations; but for many years past earthenwares have been\r\nmade in different parts of Europe, so like the oriental, that they\r\nhave acquired the name of porcelain. The first European porcelains\r\nwere made in Saxony and France, and afterwards in England, Germany,\r\nand Italy, all of which differed from those of Japan and China, but\r\neach possessing its peculiar character. They are now brought to great\r\nperfection in Europe, particularly in England, France and Prussia.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of Earthenware, what supplied its place to the\r\nearly inhabitants of the world?\r\n\r\nThe more civilized the inhabitants of any country became, the more\r\nthey would perceive the convenience of possessing vessels of various\r\ndescriptions for holding or preparing their food; some of the objects\r\nwhich first presented themselves would be the larger kinds of shells;\r\nand, in hot climates, the hard coverings of the cocoa-nut or gourd. In\r\nsome cases the skins of beasts were used, as they still are in the\r\nEast, where they are sewed together, and formed into a kind of bottle\r\nto hold milk, wine, &c.; but the people of colder climates would not\r\nbe able to avail themselves of these natural productions, and would be\r\nobliged to make use of other substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, then, would they employ?\r\n\r\nClay, which in many countries is found in great abundance, from its\r\nadhesive property, and its retaining its form when dry, and becoming\r\ninsoluble in water after having been baked in the fire, would\r\nnaturally attract the attention of an improving people: from this it\r\narises that the early remains of culinary and other vessels which have\r\nbeen discovered have been formed of this material. Among the remains\r\nof ancient Egypt, numerous vessels have been found formed of common\r\nclay baked in the fire; and, though of rude workmanship, extremely\r\nelegant in form.\r\n\r\n     _Adhesive_, sticky; apt or tending to adhere.\r\n\r\n     _Insoluble_, not capable of being dissolved.\r\n\r\n     _Culinary_, belonging to cooking or domestic purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what are Needles made?\r\n\r\nOf steel; and though exceedingly cheap, they go through a great number\r\nof operations before they are brought to perfection. It was in the\r\nreign of Queen Elizabeth that the English learnt the art of making\r\nneedles.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what are Pins made?\r\n\r\nOf brass wire, blanched with tin. They are manufactured in England,\r\nFrance, the United States, and other countries. Though there is\r\nscarcely any commodity cheaper than pins, there is no other which\r\npasses through the hands of a greater number of workmen; more than\r\ntwenty persons being successively employed in the manufacture of each,\r\nfrom the drawing of the brass wire to the sticking of the pin in the\r\npaper. Pins are supposed to have been made in England about 1543, or\r\neven earlier. Before this art was invented, the ladies made use of\r\nwooden skewers.\r\n\r\n     _Blanched_, whitened.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what is Paper made?\r\n\r\nOf linen and cotton rags beaten to a pulp in water; also from straw,\r\nwood, and many plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat materials were used for writing, before the invention of Paper?\r\n\r\nVarious were the materials on which mankind in different ages and\r\ncountries contrived to write: stones, bricks, the leaves of herbs and\r\ntrees, and their rinds or barks; tablets of wood, wax, and ivory;\r\nplates of lead, silk, linen rolls, &c. At length the Egyptian paper\r\nmade of the papyrus, was invented; then parchment; and lastly, paper\r\nmanufactured of cotton or linen rags. There are few sorts of plants\r\nwhich have not at some time been used for paper and books. In Ceylon,\r\nfor instance, the leaves of the talipot; in India, the leaves of the\r\npalm (with which they commonly covered their houses,) were used for\r\nbooks. In the East Indies, the leaves of the plantain tree, dried in\r\nthe sun, were used for the same purpose. In China, paper is made of\r\nthe inner bark of the mulberry, the bamboo, the elm, the cotton, and\r\nother trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Papyrus?\r\n\r\nA large rush, chiefly growing in Egypt, on the banks of the Nile. The\r\nancient Egyptians made sails, ropes, mats, blankets, and canvas, of\r\nthe stalks and fibres of the papyrus. Their priests also wore shoes\r\nmade of it; and even sugar was extracted from this plant. Moses, the\r\ndeliverer raised by God to rescue the Israelites from the bondage of\r\nEgypt, was exposed to the Nile in a basket of papyrus. The plant is\r\nnow, however, exceedingly scarce.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere was the first Paper Mill erected in England?\r\n\r\nAt Dartford, by a German named Spilman, in 1588. The only sort made,\r\nhowever, was the coarse brown; and it was not till 1690, when the\r\nFrench protestant refugees settled in England, that their own\r\npaper-makers began to make white writing and printing paper. The\r\nmanufacture has been brought to great perfection, both for beauty and\r\nsubstance, in England and the United States.\r\n\r\n     _Protestant_, a name given in Germany to those who adhered\r\n     to the doctrines of the apostate monk, Martin Luther,\r\n     because they protested against a decree of Charles V. and\r\n     applied to a general council.\r\n\r\n     _Refugee_, from refuge, a place of safety from danger; an\r\n     asylum. Here it more particularly means those French\r\n     Protestants who quit their homes and sought other countries,\r\n     after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which deprived\r\n     them of their religious liberty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DOME OF PISA, ITALY; WITH THE FAMOUS LEANING TOWER,\r\nIN THE DISTANCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it known to whom we are indebted for the invention of Linen Paper?\r\n\r\nNot exactly. It has long been disputed among the learned when, and\r\nby whom, it was invented; some authors say it was discovered by the\r\nGermans, others by the Italians; others ascribe it to some refugee\r\nGreeks at Basil, who took the idea from the making of cotton paper in\r\ntheir own country; some, that the Arabs first introduced it into\r\nEurope. Perhaps the Chinese have the best title to the invention,\r\ninasmuch as they have for many ages made paper, and in some provinces\r\nof the same materials as are now used by us in its manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what place was the art of Printing first practised?\r\n\r\nWho were the inventors of Printing, in what city, and in what year it\r\nwas begun, has long been a subject of great dispute. Mentz, Harlem,\r\nand Strasburg, cities of Germany, all lay claim to the invention, but\r\nMentz seems to have the best title to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the first Book that was printed from metal types?\r\n\r\nA copy of the Holy Scriptures, which made its appearance between the\r\nyears 1450 and 1452.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho introduced Printing into England?\r\n\r\nWilliam Caxton, a merchant of London, who had acquired a knowledge of\r\nit in his travels abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what does Printing consist?\r\n\r\nOf the art of taking impressions with ink, from movable characters and\r\nfigures made of metal, &c., upon paper or parchment.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Parchment?\r\n\r\nSheep or goat\'s skin, prepared after a peculiar manner, which renders\r\nit proper for several uses, especially for writing on, and for the\r\ncovering of books. The ancients seem to have used the skins of animals\r\nas a writing material, from a remote period.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what is the word Parchment taken?\r\n\r\nFrom Pergamena, the ancient name of this manufacture, which it is said\r\nto have taken from the country of Pergamus; and to Eumenes, king of\r\nthat country, its invention is usually ascribed, though in reality,\r\nthat prince appears to have been the improver, rather than the\r\ninventor of parchment; since some accounts refer its invention to a\r\nstill earlier period of time. Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian,\r\nwho lived about 450 years before Christ, relates that the ancient\r\nIonians made use of sheep and goat-skins in writing, many ages before\r\nthe time of Eumenes; the Persians of old, too, wrote all their records\r\non skins, and probably such skins were prepared and dressed for that\r\npurpose, after a manner not unlike our parchments, though not so\r\nartificially.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the Ionians?\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Ionia, an ancient country in the western part of\r\nAsia Minor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what manner is Parchment now prepared?\r\n\r\nThe sheep-skins are smeared over with lime[4] on the fleshy side,\r\nfolded, laid in heaps, and thus left for some days; they are next\r\nstretched very tight on wooden frames, after having been washed,\r\ndrained, and half dried. The flesh is then carefully taken off with\r\niron instruments constructed on purpose, and the skin cleansed from\r\nthe remaining hairs that adhere to it. After having gone through\r\nseveral operations till it is perfectly clean and smooth, it is fit\r\nfor writing upon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See Chapter XVI., article Lime.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the uses of Parchment?\r\n\r\nParchment is of great use for writings which are to be preserved, on\r\naccount of its great durability; the writing on it remaining perfect\r\nfor a great number of years. It is also used for the binding of books,\r\nand various other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Vellum?\r\n\r\nA finer sort of parchment than the former, but prepared in the same\r\nmanner, except that it is not passed through the lime-pit. It is made\r\nof the skins of very young calves: there is also a still finer sort\r\nmade of the skins of sucking lambs, or kids; this is called _virgin_\r\nparchment, and is very thin, fine, and white, and is used for\r\nfancy-work, such as ladies\' fans, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCAPERS, ALMONDS, ORANGES, LEMONS, CITRONS, LIMES, OLIVES, OILS,\r\nMELONS, TAMARINDS, AND DATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Capers?\r\n\r\nThe full-grown flower-buds of the Caper Tree, a small shrub, generally\r\nfound growing out of the fissures of rocks, or among rubbish, on old\r\nwalls and ruins, giving them a gay appearance with its large white\r\nflowers. It is a native of Italy: it is also common in the south of\r\nFrance, where it is much cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow are they prepared, and for what are they used?\r\n\r\nThey are gathered, and dried in the shade; then infused in vinegar, to\r\nwhich salt is added; after which they are put in barrels, to be used\r\nas a pickle, chiefly in sauces.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are frequently substituted for Capers?\r\n\r\nThe buds of broom pickled in the same manner, or the berries of the\r\nnasturtium, an American annual plant, with pungent fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Almonds?\r\n\r\nThe nut of the Almond Tree, a species of the peach, growing in most of\r\nthe southern parts of Europe; there are two kinds, the bitter and the\r\nsweet.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are their qualities and use?\r\n\r\nThe sweet almonds are of a soft, grateful taste, and much used by the\r\nconfectioner in numerous preparations of sweet-meats, cookery, &c.\r\nBoth sorts yield an oil, and are useful in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what country is the Orange a native?\r\n\r\nIt is a native of China, India, and most tropical countries; but has\r\nlong been produced in great perfection in the warmer parts of Europe\r\nand America. Oranges are imported in immense quantities every year,\r\nfrom the Azores, Spain, Portugal, Italy, &c. They are brought over in\r\nchests and boxes, packed separately in paper to preserve them. The\r\noranges in common use with us are the bitter or Seville, the China or\r\nsweet orange, and those from Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere are the Azores situated?\r\n\r\nIn the Atlantic Ocean, about 800 miles west of Portugal. These islands\r\nare very productive in wine and fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Seville?\r\n\r\nIn Spain; it is an ancient and considerable city, the capital of the\r\nprovince of Andalusia. The flowers of the Seville orange are highly\r\nodoriferous, and justly esteemed one of the finest perfumes. Its fruit\r\nis larger than the China orange, and rather bitter; the yellow rind or\r\npeel is warm and aromatic. The juice of oranges is a grateful and\r\nwholesome acid.\r\n\r\n     _Odoriferous_, sweet-scented, fragrant; having a brisk,\r\n     agreeable smell which may be perceived at a distance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho first introduced the China Orange into Europe?\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese. It is said that the very tree from which all the\r\nEuropean orange trees of this sort were produced, was still preserved\r\nsome years back, at the house of the Count St. Laurent, in Lisbon. In\r\nIndia, those most esteemed, and which are made presents of as\r\nrarities, are no larger than a billiard ball. The Maltese oranges are\r\nsaid by some to be the finest in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho are the Maltese?\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Malta, an island of the Mediterranean, situated\r\nbetween Africa and Sicily.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence are Lemons brought?\r\n\r\nThe Lemon is a native of Eastern Asia, whence it was brought to\r\nGreece, and afterwards to Italy; from Italy it was transplanted to\r\nSpain, Portugal, and the South of France, whence lemons are imported\r\nin great plenty.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Citron?\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Citron Tree, resembling the lemon, but somewhat\r\nlarger, and having a finer pulp. The citron was also brought\r\noriginally from the East of Asia, but has since been produced in the\r\nwarm parts of Europe, like the orange and lemon; Genoa especially is\r\nthe greatest nursery for them. Its rind is principally brought to this\r\ncountry in a candied state, and is applied by confectioners to various\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Genoa?\r\n\r\nA city of Northern Italy, on the Mediterranean, between the rivers\r\nBisagno and Polcevera.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Lime?\r\n\r\nThe Lime is by some thought to be a species of lemon, by others not;\r\nit is a smaller fruit, and in the West Indies is greatly preferred to\r\nthe lemon. It is cultivated in the South of Europe, the West Indies,\r\nand the warm parts of America. The agreeable scent called Bergamot is\r\nprepared from the rind of a small species of lime.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Olives?\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Olive Tree, an evergreen, now common in the woods of\r\nFrance, Spain, and Italy; but in the wild state producing a small\r\nfruit of no value; when cultivated, however, (which it is extensively,\r\nboth for the fruit and the quantity of oil which it yields,) it forms\r\none of the richest productions of Southern Europe. The olive came\r\noriginally from Asia. Its use is very ancient; it is frequently spoken\r\nof in the Bible, both as in a wild and cultivated state. The promised\r\nland of the Israelites was "a land of oil, olive, and honey." From the\r\ntime that the dove returned to Noah in the Ark with an "olive leaf\r\nplucked off," in all ages and countries, wherever this tree is known,\r\ndown to the present day, has an olive-branch been the favorite emblem\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat nation holds the olive in great repute?\r\n\r\nThis tree was a great favorite with the ancient Greeks, and scarcely\r\nan ancient custom existed in which the olive was not in some way\r\nassociated: at their marriages and festivals, all parts of their\r\ndwellings, especially the doors, were ornamented with them, and the\r\nsame custom prevails at the present day, both in public and private\r\nrejoicings. It was also scarcely less a favorite with the Romans,\r\nalthough it was not held in the same sacred light as amongst the\r\nGreeks. The olive-branch has likewise been universally considered the\r\nemblem of plenty, and as such, is found on the coins of those\r\ncountries of which it is _not_ a native. Two centuries after the\r\nfoundation of Rome, both Italy and Africa were strangers to this\r\nuseful plant; it afterwards became naturalized in those countries, and\r\nat length arrived in Spain, France, &c. Olive trees sometimes attain a\r\ngreat age.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow are the Olives eaten?\r\n\r\nThe olives while on the tree are intolerably bitter, without any of\r\nthat peculiar taste which gains them admittance at the richest tables;\r\nto fit them for which they are pickled. Ripe olives are eaten in the\r\nEastern countries, especially amongst the Greeks, as an article of\r\nfood, particularly in Lent. The oil, which they yield in great\r\nquantities, is very highly esteemed; being that chiefly used for\r\nsalads, &c., in medicine, and in various manufactures.\r\n\r\n     _Lent_, a time of fasting; the time from Ash-Wednesday to\r\n     Easter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the Oil drawn from the Olive?\r\n\r\nBy presses or mills made for the purpose. The sweetest and best olive\r\noil comes from the South of France, from Naples, Florence, and Lucca;\r\nquantities are also brought from Spain and the Ionian Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Naples?\r\n\r\nIn the South of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere are Florence and Lucca situated?\r\n\r\nIn Italy. Florence is a very ancient, large, and celebrated city, the\r\ncapital of Italy; Lucca, formerly a republic, belongs now to the\r\nkingdom of Italy.\r\n\r\n     _Republic_, a state in which the supreme power of government\r\n     is lodged in representatives chosen by the people, instead\r\n     of being vested in an emperor or king.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou said that the olive is an Evergreen: to what plant or shrub is the\r\nterm particularly applied?\r\n\r\nTo any shrub or tree whose leaves continue fresh and green all the\r\nyear round, winter and summer, as the laurel, pine, cedar, holly, &c.,\r\nwhich do not shed their leaves in autumn as other trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs oil a production confined to the Olive alone?\r\n\r\nBy no means. Oil is a fatty, inflammable matter, drawn from many\r\nvegetable and animal bodies. The oils in common use are of three\r\ndifferent kinds. The first are mere _oily_ or fatty bodies, extracted\r\neither by pressure, or by decoction: of the first kind are those of\r\nalmonds, nuts, olives, &c.; and of the other, those of different\r\nberries, &c., which are procured by boiling the substance in water,\r\nwhich causes the oil to collect on the top.\r\n\r\n     _Decoction_, act of boiling--a chemical term.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the second and third kinds of Oils?\r\n\r\nThe second are those drawn from vegetables by common distillation in\r\nthe alembic, with the aid of water; these contain the _oily_ and\r\nvolatile part of the plant, and are called _essential_ oils. The third\r\nsort are those produced by distillation, but of a different kind in an\r\nopen vessel, and without the help of water. They are likewise divided\r\ninto _vegetable_ oils, _animal_ oils, and _mineral_ oils; which last\r\nare those drawn from amber, and a few other substances partaking both\r\nof the vegetable and mineral natures, as Petroleum, commonly known as\r\nkerosene or coal oil.\r\n\r\n     _Alembic_, a chemical vessel used in distilling. It consists\r\n     of a vessel placed over a fire, containing the substance to\r\n     be distilled; the upper part, which receives and condenses\r\n     the steam, is called the head; the beak of this is fitted to\r\n     a vessel called a receiver.\r\n\r\n     _Volatile_, easily escaping, quickly flying off.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence is the word Oil derived?\r\n\r\nFrom the Latin _oleum_, formed from _olea, olive-tree_, the fruit of\r\nwhich abounds in oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat immense fish is it that furnishes us with a quantity of _animal_\r\noil?\r\n\r\nThe Whale, the largest and noblest inhabitant of the waters. It is\r\nprotected from the cold by a case or coating of blubber, that is, a\r\nthick oily fat from which the oil is made; numbers of them are caught\r\nfor the sake of that. Ambergris, highly prized in perfumery, is a\r\nproduct of the sperm whale.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what seas are they found?\r\n\r\nChiefly in the Northern Seas: extensive whale fisheries are carried on\r\nby the Americans, English, Dutch, &c., and numbers of vessels are sent\r\nout for the purpose of taking the fish: they usually sail in the\r\nlatter end of March, and begin fishing about May. The whale fishery\r\ncontinues generally from that time till the latter end of June or\r\nJuly. There are also other fishes and animals which afford us oils of\r\ndifferent kinds, which are used for various purposes in medicine and\r\nthe arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the oil called _castor_, which is so much used in medicine, the\r\nproduct of an animal or a plant?\r\n\r\nCastor oil is expressed from a West Indian shrub, called Palma\r\nChristi; and especially from the ripe seeds, which are full of this\r\noil. It is prepared by collecting these ripe seeds, and freeing them\r\nfrom the husks; then bruising and beating them into a paste; they are\r\nnext boiled in water, when the oil rising to the surface is skimmed\r\noff as it continues to appear. The Castor-oil plant is found growing\r\nabundantly in Sumatra, particularly near the sea-shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Sumatra situated?\r\n\r\nIn the Oriental Archipelago, off the south eastern part of the\r\ncontinent of Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what other countries is this plant found?\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Africa, Syria, and Egypt. It was anciently cultivated\r\nin the two last-mentioned countries in large quantities, the seeds\r\nbeing used for the oil they yielded, which was burnt in lamps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEAVERS BUILDING THEIR HUTS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not the Palma Christi much affected by soil and situation?\r\n\r\nGreatly so. In some places it attains the stature of a tree, and is\r\nnot a biennial plant, but endures for many years, as in the warm\r\nplains of Irak, Arabia, and some parts of Africa.\r\n\r\n     _Biennial_, lasting for the space of two years only.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Melons?\r\n\r\nA species of the Cucumis, a genus of plants to which the cucumber\r\nbelongs. There are great varieties of this fruit cultivated in\r\ndifferent parts of the world; that sort called the Cantaleup (so named\r\nfrom being cultivated at a place of that name in the neighborhood of\r\nRome, whither it was brought from Armenia,) is a species of\r\nmusk-melon; the mature fruit is juicy, and delicately flavored.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Armenia situated?\r\n\r\nArmenia is a large country situated in Asiatic Turkey, to the west of\r\nthe Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat species of Melon is that which almost makes up for a scarcity of\r\ngood water in hot countries?\r\n\r\nThe water-melon, which affords a cool, refreshing juice, and quenches\r\nthe thirst produced by the excessive heats. It requires a dry, sandy\r\nsoil, and a warm climate; the pulp of the fruit is remarkably rich and\r\ndelicious.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Tamarinds?\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Tamarind Tree, a native of both the Indies, Asia,\r\nAfrica, &c. It is of a roundish form, and composed of two pods\r\ninclosed one within the other, between which is a soft pulpy\r\nsubstance, of a tart but agreeable taste; the inner pod contains the\r\nseeds or stones.\r\n\r\n     _Tart_, sharp, acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what are they used?\r\n\r\nWe use them only as medicine; but the Africans, and many of the\r\nOriental nations, with whom they are common, make them into a kind of\r\npreserve with sugar, which they eat as a delicacy, and which cools\r\nthem in the violent heats of their climate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what nation was the knowledge of their use in medicine obtained?\r\n\r\nFrom the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does the word Oriental signify?\r\n\r\nBelonging to the East; therefore those countries of the globe situated\r\nin the East are called Oriental, those in the West, Occidental, from\r\n_Oriens_, signifying East, and _Occidens_, West.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Dates?\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Palm, a beautiful and graceful tree, peculiar to the\r\nwarmer regions of the globe; the growth of the palm is extremely\r\nsingular, for although some species attain to the height of the\r\nlargest forest trees, their structure differs materially from that of\r\na tree, properly so called. The leaves of the young plant arise\r\ndirectly from the surface of the ground, and there is no appearance of\r\nany stem for several years; this stem once formed, never increases in\r\nsize, the growth of the plant being always upward, so that the stem\r\nitself is formed by the prior growth of the green portions of the\r\npalm.\r\n\r\n     _Structure_, the manner of formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow often does this tree cast its circle of leaves?\r\n\r\nEvery year; so that the number of years a palm has existed is known by\r\nthe scars which are left by their falling off. The palm is an\r\nevergreen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the uses of this Tree?\r\n\r\nThe Palm is of the utmost importance to the inhabitants of the\r\ntropical regions; the fruit and sap providing them with food, the\r\nfibrous parts with clothing, and the leaves forming the greater part\r\nof their slightly-constructed huts; the leaves of some species are\r\nformed into fans, hats, and parasols; others are written on, in the\r\nsame manner that we write on paper; artificial flowers are made of\r\nthe pith of some; the light and supple rattan walking-cane is the\r\nslender shoot of another kind; and solid and useful utensils are made\r\nof the shell of the cocoa-nut. The fibres of the Date Palm are formed\r\ninto ropes and twine; a liquor is drawn from the trunk, called palm\r\nwine; the trunks of the old trees furnish a hard and durable wood; and\r\neven the nuts or stones of the fruit are useful for feeding cattle; a\r\nwholesome flour is also made of the fruit, when dried and reduced to\r\npowder.\r\n\r\n     _Constructed_, put together.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence is its name derived?\r\n\r\nFrom the Latin word _palma_, a hand, given to these productions of the\r\nvegetable world, from the supposed resemblance of their broad leaves\r\nto the human hand. The Date, the fruit of the Date Palm, derives its\r\nname from the Greek _dactylus_, a finger, from its mode of growing in\r\nclusters spreading out like the fingers of the hand. The Palm\r\nsometimes forms impenetrable forests; but more frequently is found in\r\nsmall groups of two or three, or even singly, beside springs and\r\nfountains of water, affording a kindly shade to the thirsty traveller.\r\n\r\n     _Impenetrable_, not easily penetrated or got through.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what countries are Dates brought?\r\n\r\nFrom Egypt, Syria, Persia, Africa, and the Indies. Among the Egyptians\r\nand Africans, they make a principal article of food. Dates, when ripe,\r\nare of a bright coral red, of an oblong form, and possess a sharp\r\nbiting taste: they are usually gathered in autumn, before being\r\nperfectly ripe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nHATS, STOCKINGS, SHOES, GLOVES, LEATHER, FURS, AND INK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what are Hats made?\r\n\r\nOf felt and wool. Dress hats for men\'s wear, were formerly made of\r\nbeaver-fur, but the increasing scarcity of this article led to the\r\nintroduction of silk plush as a substitute, and the result is that\r\nbeaver is entirely superseded, and plush is used altogether. They\r\npossess many advantages over the beaver hat, as they are light,\r\nglossy, and durable. Hats are also made of straw, plaited and sewed\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen did Hats come into general use?\r\n\r\nThe first mention made of hats is about the time of the Saxons, but\r\nthey were not worn except by the rich. Hats for men were invented at\r\nParis, by a Swiss, in 1404. About the year 1510, they were first\r\nmanufactured in London, by Spaniards. Before that time both men and\r\nwomen in England commonly wore close, knitted, woollen caps. They\r\nappear to have become more common in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It\r\nis related, that when Charles the Second made his public entry into\r\nRouen, in 1449, he wore a hat lined with red velvet, surmounted with a\r\nplume or tuft of feathers; from which entry, or at least during his\r\nreign, the use of hats and caps is to be dated; and from that time\r\nthey took the place of chaperons and hoods, that had been worn before\r\nin France.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Rouen?\r\n\r\nIn the province of Lower Seine, in France; it was formerly the capital\r\nof Normandy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the Castor, or Beaver, and its habits.\r\n\r\nThe Beaver has a broad, flat tail, covered with scales, serving as a\r\nrudder to direct its motion in the water; the toes of its hind feet\r\nare furnished with membranes, after the manner of water-fowl; the fore\r\nfeet supply the place of hands, like those of the squirrel. The\r\nBeaver has two kinds of hair, of a light brown color, one long and\r\ncoarse, the other short and silky. The teeth resemble those of a rat\r\nor squirrel, but are longer, and admirably adapted for cutting timber\r\nor stripping off the bark from trees.\r\n\r\n     _Membranes_, thin, flexible, expanded skins, connecting the\r\n     toes of water-fowl and amphibious animals, and thus enabling\r\n     them to swim with greater ease.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere do Beavers usually fix their habitations?\r\n\r\nTheir houses are always situated in the water; they are composed of\r\nclay, which they make into a kind of mortar with their paws: these\r\nhuts are of an oval figure, divided into three apartments raised one\r\nabove the other, and erected on piles driven into the mud. Each beaver\r\nhas his peculiar cell assigned him, the floor of which he strews with\r\nleaves or small branches of the pine tree. The whole building is\r\ngenerally capable of containing eight or ten inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn what does the Beaver feed?\r\n\r\nIts food consists of fruit and plants; and in winter, of the wood of\r\nthe ash and other trees. The hunters and trappers in America formerly\r\nkilled vast numbers for their skins, which were in great demand, as\r\nthey were used in making hats, but as the only use they are now put to\r\nis for trimming, and for men\'s gloves and collars, the demand has\r\nfallen off.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what are stockings made?\r\n\r\nOf cotton, silk, or wool, woven or knitted. Anciently, the only\r\nstockings in use were made of cloth, or stuff sewed together; but\r\nsince the invention of knitting and weaving stockings of silk, &c.,\r\nthe use of cloth has been discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what country is it supposed that the invention of silk knitted\r\nstockings originally came?\r\n\r\nFrom Spain, in 1589. The art of weaving stockings in a frame was\r\ninvented by William Lee, M.A., of St. John\'s College, Cambridge,\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplain the signification of M.A.\r\n\r\nMaster of Arts, a degree of honor conferred by the Universities.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Shoes?\r\n\r\nA covering for the foot, now usually made of leather. In different\r\nages and countries, shoes have been made of various materials, as raw\r\nskins, rushes, broom, paper, silk, wool, iron, silver, and gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat nation wore Shoes made of the bark of the papyrus?\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians. The Turks always take off their shoes, and leave them\r\nat the door, when they enter Mosques or dwelling-houses. The same\r\ncustom also prevails in other Eastern nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Mosque?\r\n\r\nA Mahomedan church or temple.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by Mahomedan?\r\n\r\nBelonging to the religion of Mahomed, the warrior and prophet of\r\nArabia and Turkey, who was its founder. He was born at Mecca, a city\r\nof Arabia, in 571; and died in 631, at Medina, a city situated between\r\nArabia Felix and Arabia Deserta. His creed maintains that there is but\r\none God, and that Mahomed is his Prophet; it enjoins the observance of\r\nprayers, washings, almsgiving, fasting, sobriety, pilgrimage to Mecca,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do the appellations of Felix and Deserta signify?\r\n\r\nArabia, a country of Asia, lying on the borders of the Red Sea, is\r\ndivided into Petr\xc3\xa6a, Deserta, and Felix; Petr\xc3\xa6a, signifying the Stony;\r\nDeserta, the Desert; and Felix, the fortunate or fruitful.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Leather?\r\n\r\nThe skins of various animals, as oxen, cows, calves, &c., dressed and\r\nprepared for use.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the Leather prepared?\r\n\r\nBy tanning; that is, steeping the skins in an infusion of tan, by\r\nwhich they are rendered firm, durable, and, in a great degree,\r\nimpervious to water.\r\n\r\n     _Infusion_, a liquor made by steeping anything in water, or\r\n     other liquids, without boiling.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Tan?\r\n\r\nThe bark of the oak-tree, &c., ground by a mill into a coarse powder.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Lime?[5]\r\n\r\nA white, soft, friable, earthy substance, prepared from marble, chalk,\r\nand other lime-stones, or from shells, by burning in a kiln.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: For a further account of it, see Chapters XIII. & XVI.]\r\n\r\n     _Friable_, easily powdered.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what is it used?\r\n\r\nIts greatest use is in the composition of mortar for building; it is\r\nalso much used by tanners, skinners, &c., in the preparation of\r\nleather; by soap-boilers in the manufacture of soap; and by\r\nsugar-bakers for refining sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Kiln?\r\n\r\nA fabric of brick or stone, formed for admitting heat in order to dry\r\nor burn materials placed in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what are Gloves made?\r\n\r\nOf leather, silk, thread, cotton, worsted, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat skins are generally used for Gloves?\r\n\r\nThose of the chamois, kid, lamb, dog, doe, and many other animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Furs, and how are they prepared?\r\n\r\nFurs are the skins of wild animals, dressed with the hair on, and used\r\nas apparel, either for warmth, ornament, or distinction of rank or\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n\r\nName a few of the principal furs in use.\r\n\r\nThe fur of the ermine, an animal inhabiting the cold regions of Europe\r\nand America, is highly valued, and much used for ornamental purposes.\r\nIn summer, the upper part of the body is of a yellowish-brown color;\r\nthe under parts white, slightly tinged with yellow. It is then called\r\na _stoat_. In winter, the fur is closer and finer, and is of a snowy\r\nwhite color; the tip of the tail is black throughout the year. In\r\nEurope the fur is much used for ornamenting the state robes of\r\nsovereigns and nobles. The sable is another animal much prized for its\r\nrich fur; it is a native of Northern Europe and America. The skins of\r\nthe marten, found in North America, as well as in Northern Asia and\r\nthe mountains of Kamtschatka; and also of the bear, fox, raccoon,\r\nbadger, lynx, musk-rat, rabbit, hare, and squirrel, which are all\r\nprocured in North America, are valuable. One of the most valuable\r\ndescriptions of fur is that of the seal.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is it procured?\r\n\r\nBy hunting the animals, which is the employment both of natives and\r\nsettlers from other countries; the hunters sell the skins for money,\r\nto a company established for the purpose of trading in furs, or more\r\nfrequently exchange them for clothes, arms, and other articles. The\r\nAlaska Commercial Company of San Francisco is granted by the United\r\nStates Government the exclusive privilege of catching the fur seal.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Alum?\r\n\r\nA kind of mineral, of a strong, sharp taste. It dissolves both in cold\r\nand boiling water, but best in the latter. It is of some use in\r\nmedicine; a principal ingredient in dyeing and coloring, neither of\r\nwhich can be well performed without it, as it sets and brightens the\r\ncolors, and prevents them from washing out. It is also extremely\r\nuseful in many arts and manufactures.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there not different sorts of this material?\r\n\r\nThe principal kinds are native alums: _viz._ those prepared and\r\nperfected underground by the spontaneous operations of nature; as the\r\nroch, commonly called rock alum, from Rocha, in Syria, whence it is\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\n     _Spontaneous_, unassisted by art.\r\n\r\n     _Orientals_, inhabitants of the Eastern parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Ink?\r\n\r\nA liquor used in writing on paper or parchment, made of copperas,\r\ngalls; and gum arabic[6] mixed together. There are likewise several\r\nplants that may serve for the making of ink, as oak-bark, red roses,\r\nlog-wood, &c. It is also made from an infusion of oak galls and iron\r\nfilings: there are also many other ways, as well as materials,\r\nemployed in the making of this useful article. Ink is the name applied\r\nto all liquids used in writing, of whatever color they may be, as red,\r\nblue, &c., though black is the most used for common purposes. The ink\r\nof the ancients seems to have been of a thick, oily nature, unlike the\r\nmodern ink; it consisted of nothing more than a species of soot, or\r\nivory black, mixed with one fourth of gum.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See Chapter XI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Copperas?\r\n\r\nA kind of vitriol. Copperas is the name given to green vitriol, which\r\nis a preparation from iron. The blue vitriol is a sulphate of copper,\r\nand the white vitriol a sulphate of zinc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what is Vitriol used?\r\n\r\nIn the making of glass, to color it; in many arts and manufactures;\r\nand in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Galls?\r\n\r\nExcrescences formed on a kind of oak tree in certain warm climates;\r\nperforations are made by an insect into the bark of the tree, whence\r\nissues a liquid which hardens by exposure. They are used in dyeing,\r\nmaking ink, and other compositions. There are two sorts of oak galls\r\nin our shops, brought from the Levant, and the southern parts of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does the word Levant signify?\r\n\r\nA country to the eastward. It is applied to the countries of Turkey,\r\nGreece, Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, &c., which are washed by the eastern\r\npart of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the Ink used in Printing the same as writing Ink?\r\n\r\nNo; it is more of the nature of paint, being thicker and more\r\nglutinous: it chiefly consists of a mixture of oil and lamp-black, or\r\nsome other ingredient, according to the color required; and is\r\nremarkable for the ease with which it adheres to paper that is\r\nmoistened.\r\n\r\n     _Glutinous_, gummy, resembling glue.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Indian, or Chinese Ink?\r\n\r\nAn admirable composition, not liquid like our ink, but solid, and made\r\ninto cakes somewhat like the mineral colors we use in painting. It is\r\nmade into all sorts of figures, usually long, and about an inch thick;\r\nsometimes gilt with the figures of birds, flowers, &c. To use this\r\nink, it must be rubbed with water, on stone or earthenware, till it\r\nproduces a beautiful, liquid, shining black. It is used in drawing,\r\n&c., and is brought from China. It is composed of lamp-black and size,\r\nor animal glue, or gum, to which perfumes and other substances are\r\nsometimes added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nASBESTUS, SALT, COAL, IRON, COPPER, BRASS, ZINC, AND LAPIS\r\nCALAMINARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the name of the remarkable stone of which a cloth has been\r\nmade, that resists the action of fire?\r\n\r\nThe Asbestus, a mineral substance of a whitish or silver color. There\r\nare several species of this mineral, which are distinguished by\r\ndifferent names, according to the appearance of each, as fibrous\r\nasbestus, hard asbestus, and woody asbestus; it is the fibrous sort\r\nwhich is most noted for its uses in the arts. It is usually found\r\ninclosed within very hard stones; sometimes growing on their outside,\r\nand sometimes detached from them.\r\n\r\n     _Fibrous_, full of fibres or threads.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are its qualities?\r\n\r\nIt is insipid; will not dissolve in water; and exposed to the fire, it\r\nneither consumes nor calcines. The industry of mankind has found a\r\nmethod of working upon this untoward mineral and employing it in\r\nmaking cloth and paper; the process is, however, difficult.\r\n\r\n     _Insipid_, without taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas not this curious mineral better known to the ancients than it is\r\nat present?\r\n\r\nThe linen made from it was highly esteemed by them; it was not only\r\nbetter known, but more common, than among us, being equally valuable\r\nwith the richest pearls; but the superiority of all other cloths to\r\nthis in every respect, except the resistance to fire, has caused\r\nincombustible cloth to be regarded in modern times merely as a\r\ncuriosity, but it is still employed in chemical preparations.\r\n\r\n     _Incombustible_, remaining undestroyed in fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what use did they put it?\r\n\r\nIn royal funerals, it formed the shroud to wrap the body in that its\r\nashes might be prevented from mingling with the wood, &c., that\r\ncomposed the pile. Some of the ancients made themselves clothes of it,\r\nparticularly the Brahmins among the Hindoos; it formed wicks for their\r\nperpetual lamps; thread, ropes, nets, and paper were also made of it.\r\nPliny, the Roman naturalist, says he has seen napkins of asbestus\r\ntaken soiled from the table after a feast, which were thrown into the\r\nfire, and by that means better scoured than if they had been washed\r\nwith water.\r\n\r\n     _Naturalist_, a person who studies nature, especially in\r\n     what relates to minerals, vegetables, and animals.\r\n\r\n     _Brahmins_, Hindoo priests.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is the Asbestus found?\r\n\r\nThis mineral is found in the greatest quantity in the silver mines of\r\nSaxony; at Bleyburg, in Carinthia; in Sweden, Corsica, and sometimes\r\nin France, England, and the United States; also in Tartary and\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat method is used in preparing the Asbestus?\r\n\r\nThe stone is laid in warm water to soak, then opened and divided by\r\nthe hands, that the earthy matter may be washed out. This washing is\r\nseveral times repeated, and the flax-like filaments collected and\r\ndried; these are easily spun with the addition of flax. The cloth when\r\nwoven is best preserved by oil from breaking or wasting; on exposure\r\nto the fire, the flax and the oil burn out, and the cloth remains of a\r\npure white. The shorter threads, which separate on washing the stone,\r\nmay be made into paper in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Salt?\r\n\r\nA saline crystallization of a sharp, pungent taste, and cleansing\r\nquality, used to season flesh, fish, butter, &c., and other things\r\nthat are to be kept. It is distinguished, with reference to the\r\ngeneral sources from which it is most plentifully derived, into three\r\ndifferent sorts, namely, fossil, or rock salt; sea, or marine salt;\r\nand spring salt, or that drawn from briny springs and wells.\r\n\r\n     _Marine_, belonging to the sea.\r\n\r\n     _Saline_, consisting of salt.\r\n\r\n     _Briny_, consisting of brine; which means water tasting of\r\n     salt; it is used to signify the waters of the sea, or any\r\n     salt water.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Fossil or Rock Salt?\r\n\r\nThat which is found in large beds in the bowels of the earth, and\r\nwhich has not undergone any artificial preparation; it is sometimes\r\ncolorless, but more frequently red, yellow, or blue, and mixed with\r\nearthy impurities; this salt was entirely unknown to the ancients, who\r\nby rock salt meant that which adheres to the rocks above high-water\r\nmark, being lodged there by the spray of the sea, which is evaporated\r\nby the heat of the sun; this is the purest salt, and is to be found on\r\nthe rocks of Sicily, and several islands of the West Indies.\r\n\r\n     _Artificial_, produced by art, and the labor of man.\r\n\r\n     _Evaporated_, converted into vapor and dissipated.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Marine Salt?\r\n\r\nThat which is made from sea-water, concentrated by repeated\r\nevaporations, and at length crystallized.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Spring Salt?\r\n\r\nThat salt which is not made from sea-water, but from the water of salt\r\nwells or springs; large quantities of this salt are made in the United\r\nStates, in some parts of which saline springs are numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what manner is it obtained?\r\n\r\nThe means employed for extracting the salt from the water vary\r\naccording to circumstances. In hot countries, the water is merely\r\nexposed to the action of the sun, until the water is evaporated; the\r\nsalt procured in this manner is considered the best.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat method is usually employed in countries where the sun\'s heat is\r\nnot sufficiently powerful?\r\n\r\nIn climates where the rays of the sun do not afford sufficient heat,\r\nthe water, which has been partly evaporated in large shallow\r\nreservoirs formed in the earth, called salt-pans, is poured into\r\nenormous coppers and boiled for four or five hours: when the contents\r\nof the copper are wasted to half the quantity, the liquid begins to be\r\ncrystallized; the vessel is again filled up, and the brine again\r\nboiled and purified: this is repeated three or four times. After the\r\nlast purifying the fire is kept very low for twelve or fourteen hours,\r\nand when the moisture is nearly evaporated the salt is removed, and,\r\nafter the remaining brine has drained off, is placed in the\r\nstore-houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what countries is Salt generally found?\r\n\r\nThis substance, so necessary to the comfort of mankind, is widely\r\ndistributed over the face of the earth, and nothing, except, perhaps,\r\nthe air we breathe, is more easily placed within our reach. The ocean\r\nis an exhaustless store-house of this valuable article. Those nations\r\nof the earth which are placed at a distance from the sea, find\r\nthemselves provided with magazines of salt, either in solid masses, or\r\ndissolved in the waters of inland lakes, or issuing from the solid\r\nrocks in springs of brine. At Salina, Syracuse, and other places in\r\nOnondaga Co., New York, salt springs are remarkably abundant, and\r\nyield annually several millions of bushels; immense quantities are\r\nalso obtained from the salt-wells on the Great and Little Kanawha, and\r\nother places in Western Virginia; it is also extensively manufactured\r\nin the western part of Pennsylvania, and throughout the Western\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nName the countries most noted for mines of Salt.\r\n\r\nPoland, Upper Hungary, and the mountains of Catalonia, have extensive\r\nsalt mines; those in the village of Wieliczca, in Poland, about five\r\nleagues from Cracow, are of a surprising depth and size. In the\r\ninterior of Hindostan, there is a remarkable salt lake; and in several\r\nparts of the globe there are spots of ground impregnated entirely with\r\nthis substance: an island of the East Indies contains a singular kind\r\nof fossil, or native dry salt; the soil there is in general very\r\nfruitful, but in certain parts of the island, there are spots of\r\nground entirely barren, without the appearance of anything vegetable\r\nupon them; these spots taste very much of salt, and abound with it in\r\nsuch quantities, as to supply not only the whole island, but the\r\ngreater part of the adjacent continent. In Utah Territory, especially\r\nin the neighborhood of the Mormon city, at the Great Salt Lake, are\r\nfound extensive plains thus impregnated with salt, which is procured\r\nin great abundance.\r\n\r\n     _Fossil_, the remains of minerals or shells dug from the\r\n     earth.\r\n\r\n     _Impregnated_, filled, saturated.\r\n\r\n     _Catalonia_, a considerable province of Spain, situated to\r\n     the north-east.\r\n\r\n     _Adjacent_, adjoining, lying near, or contiguous.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what use did the ancient inhabitants of Africa and Arabia put this\r\nsubstance?\r\n\r\nThe large slabs of rock salt, with which their country abounds, were\r\nemployed by them instead of stones, in building their dwellings, the\r\npieces being easily cemented together by sprinkling the joints with\r\nwater, which, melting the parts of the two surfaces that opposed each\r\nother, formed the whole, when dry, into one solid block.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes Rock Salt undergo any preparation before it is used?\r\n\r\nYes; when taken from the earth it is dissolved in cold water, and\r\nafterwards drawn off into salt-pans, and refined in the same manner as\r\nthe sea salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Coal?\r\n\r\nA hard, black, sulphurous and inflammable substance, dug out of the\r\nearth, serving in many countries as fuel. It is common in most of the\r\ncountries of Europe and America. In some parts of the United States,\r\nit is found in beds having an area of several thousand square miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what is Coal supposed to have originated?\r\n\r\nIts origin is supposed to be derived from gigantic trees which\r\nflourished in the swamps and forests of the primeval earth. These\r\nhaving been torn away from their native bed, by storms and\r\ninundations, were transported into some adjacent lake, river, or sea.\r\nHere they floated on the waters until, saturated with them, they sank\r\nto the bottom, and being buried in the lower soil of adjacent lands,\r\nbecame transformed into a new state among the members of the mineral\r\nkingdom. A long interment followed, during which a course of chemical\r\nchanges, and new combinations of their vegetable elements, converted\r\nthem to the mineral condition of coal.\r\n\r\n     _Primeval_, original, existing before the flood.\r\n\r\n     _Gigantic_, extremely large, greater than the usual size.\r\n\r\n     _Interment_, burial under the ground.\r\n\r\n     _Elements_, the several parts or principles of which bodies\r\n     are composed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Coal Mine?\r\n\r\nA subterraneous excavation, from which coal is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo the terms Coal and Charcoal signify the same substance?\r\n\r\nNo; Charcoal is an artificial fuel, made in imitation of coal, by\r\nburning wood covered with earth so as partially to exclude the air. It\r\nis used for various purposes, as the making of gunpowder,[7] polishing\r\nbrass and copper, &c., and when a clear and bright fire is required,\r\nas it burns with little or no smoke; it is dangerous, however, for one\r\nto remain many hours in a close room with a charcoal fire, as the\r\nfumes it throws out are hurtful, and would destroy life. Charcoal, in\r\nfact, is the coaly residuum of any vegetables burnt in close vessels;\r\nbut the common charcoal is that prepared from wood, and is generally\r\nblack, very brittle, light, and destitute of taste or smell. It is a\r\npowerful antiseptic, unalterable and indestructible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See Chapter XII.]\r\n\r\n     _Residuum_, the remaining part, that which is left.\r\n\r\n     _Antiseptic_, that which prevents putrefaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Iron?\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful and abundant metals; being found in all mineral\r\nearths, and stones; in plants, and animal fluids; and is the chief\r\ncause of the varieties of color in all. Iron is found in great masses,\r\nin various states, in the bowels of the earth; it is usually, however,\r\ncompounded with stone, from which it is separated by the action of\r\nfire. In some parts of the world, whole mountains are formed of iron;\r\namong these may be mentioned the Pilot Knob and the Iron Mountain, in\r\nMissouri, being unsurpassed by anything of the kind found elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are its characteristics?\r\n\r\nIt is hard, fusible, not very malleable, but extremely ductile, and\r\nvery tenacious; it is of a greyish color, and nearly eight times\r\nheavier than water. Without iron, society could make no progress in\r\nthe cultivation of the ground, in mechanical arts or trades, in\r\narchitecture or navigation; it is therefore of the greatest use to\r\nman. Iron tools have been used in all European countries as long as\r\ntheir histories have existed; this metal appears likewise to have been\r\nknown and used by the inhabitants of the world in the earliest ages,\r\nbeing frequently mentioned in the Holy Scriptures. In the fourth\r\nchapter of Genesis, Tubalcain is spoken of as "a hammerer and\r\nartificer in every work of brass and iron," and thus their existence\r\nwas evidently known at that early period of the world.\r\n\r\n     _Artificer_, one who works or makes.\r\n\r\n     _Fusible_, capable of being melted by fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SALT MINES OF WIELICZCA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by Metals?\r\n\r\nUseful substances dug from the bowels of the earth, being sometimes\r\nfound pure, but mostly combined with other matter. They are\r\ndistinguished by their weight, tenacity, hardness, opacity, color, and\r\npeculiar lustre, known as the metallic lustre; they are fusible by\r\nheat, and good conductors of heat and electricity; many of them are\r\nmalleable, and some extremely ductile. Those which were first known\r\nare gold, silver, iron, copper, mercury, lead, and tin.\r\n\r\n     _Tenacity_, the firmness with which one part adheres to\r\n     another.\r\n\r\n     _Opacity_, want of transparency or clearness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Metals called in their natural state?\r\n\r\nOres; so named because the metal contained in them is either mixed\r\nwith other metals, or with mineral earths, from which they are\r\nseparated and purified by various means: such as washing, roasting,\r\n&c., but the method is always regulated by the nature of the ore.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Copper?\r\n\r\nA hard, heavy, ductile metal, found native, and in many ores; of these\r\nthe most important is _copper pyrites_, which is a sulphuret of\r\ncopper. Next to gold, silver, and platinum, copper is the most\r\nmalleable and ductile of metals; it may be drawn into wires as fine as\r\nhair, or beaten into leaves as thin as those of silver. The rust of\r\ncopper is very poisonous. Copper, mixed with a certain quantity of\r\ntin, forms bell-metal. With a smaller proportion, it forms bronze, a\r\nsubstance used in sculpture for casting figures and statues. It is an\r\nabundant metal, and is found in various parts of the world. Native\r\noxides of copper are found in Cornwall, Siberia, and in North and\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\n     _Oxide_, a substance combined with Oxygen,[8] in a\r\n     proportion not sufficient to produce acidity.\r\n\r\n     _Sulphuret_, a combination of sulphur with a base.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See Chapter XIII., article Oxygen.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the uses of Copper?\r\n\r\nThey are too various to be enumerated. In sheets it is much used to\r\nsheathe the bottoms of ships, for boilers, and other utensils. Copper\r\ncoin was the only money used by the Romans till the 485th year of\r\ntheir city, when silver began to be coined. In Sweden, houses are\r\ncovered with this metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Mine?\r\n\r\nA cavity under ground, formed for the purpose of obtaining metals,\r\n&c.; mines are often very deep and extensive. The descent into them is\r\nby a pit, called a shaft; the clues by which mines are discovered,\r\nare, mineral springs, the discoloration of vegetables, the appearance\r\nof pieces of ore, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Clues_, signs or means by which things hidden are brought\r\n     to light.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Brass?\r\n\r\nA factitious metal, consisting of copper and zinc. Brass is lighter\r\nand harder than pure copper, and less subject to rust; owing to these\r\nproperties, together with its beautiful color, it is extremely useful\r\nin the manufacture of many utensils.\r\n\r\n     _Factitious_, made by art, not found in a natural state.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Zinc?\r\n\r\nA metal of a brilliant bluish white color. Its name was unknown to the\r\nancient Greeks and Arabians. It is mixed with other substances in the\r\nore, from which it is obtained by smelting in the furnace. It has\r\nnever yet been found native or pure.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what is Zinc used?\r\n\r\nFrom its readiness to dissolve in all acids, and unite with other\r\nmetals, it is used in alloy with them in the composition of brass, &c.\r\nThin sheets of zinc are also used to cover roofs of houses, and in the\r\nmanufacture of various household utensils.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Lapis Calaminaris?\r\n\r\nLapis Calaminaris, or calamine stone, is a native carbonate of zinc,\r\nof some use in medicine, but chiefly in founding. It is, sometimes\r\nbrownish, as that found in Germany and England, or red, as that of\r\nFrance. It is dug out of mines, usually in small pieces; generally out\r\nof those of lead. Calamine is mostly found in barren, rocky soils.\r\n\r\n_Founding_, the art of casting metals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nYAMS, MANGOES, BREAD-FRUIT, SHEA OR BUTTER TREE, COW TREE, WATER\r\nTREE, LICORICE, MANNA, OPIUM, TOBACCO, AND GUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Yams?\r\n\r\nThe roots of a climbing plant growing in tropical climates. The root\r\nof the yam is wholesome and well-flavored; nearly as large as a man\'s\r\nleg, and of an irregular form. Yams are much used for food in those\r\ncountries where they grow; the natives either roast or boil them, and\r\nthe white people grind them into flour, of which they make bread and\r\npuddings. The yam is of a dirty brown color outside, but white and\r\nmealy within.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Mangoes?\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Mango Tree, a native of India and the south-western\r\nparts of Asia; it also grows abundantly in the West Indies and Brazil.\r\nIt was introduced into Jamaica in 1782; where it attains the height of\r\nthirty or forty feet, with thick and wide-extended branches. The\r\nvarieties of the mango are very numerous,--upwards of eighty are\r\ncultivated; and the quality of these varies according to the countries\r\nand situations in which they grow. The mangoes of Asia are said to be\r\nmuch better than those of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the appearance of the Mango Tree.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of this tree are small and whitish, formed in pyramidal\r\nclusters. The fruit has some resemblance to a short thick cucumber,\r\nabout the size of a goose\'s egg; its taste is delicious and cooling;\r\nit has a stone in the centre, like that of a peach. At first this\r\nfruit is of a fine green color, and some varieties continue so, while\r\nothers change to a fine golden or orange color. The mango tree is an\r\nevergreen, bearing fruit once or twice a year, from six or seven years\r\nold to a hundred.\r\n\r\n_Pyramidal_, resembling a pyramid.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is this fruit eaten?\r\n\r\nWhen ripe, it is eaten by the natives either in its natural state, or\r\nbruised in wine. It is brought to us either candied or pickled, as the\r\nripe fruit is very perishable; in the latter case, they are opened\r\nwith a knife, and the middle filled up with fresh ginger, garlic,\r\nmustard, salt, and oil or vinegar. The fruit of the largest variety\r\nweighs two pounds or upwards. The several parts of this tree are all\r\napplied to some use by the Hindoos: the wood is consecrated to the\r\nservice of the dead; from the flour of the dried kernels different\r\nkinds of food are prepared; the leaves, flowers, and bark, are\r\nmedicinal.\r\n\r\n_Medicinal_, fit for medicine, possessing medical properties.\r\n\r\n_Consecrated_, separated from a common to a sacred use.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there not a tree which bears a fruit that may be used for bread?\r\n\r\nYes; the Bread-fruit Tree, originally found in the southeastern parts\r\nof Asia and the islands of the Pacific Ocean, though introduced into\r\nthe tropical parts of America. It is one of the most interesting, as\r\nwell as singular productions of the vegetable kingdom, being no less\r\nbeautiful than it is useful. This tree is large and shady; its leaves\r\nare broad and indented, like those of the fig tree--from twelve to\r\neighteen inches long, rather fleshy, and of a dark green. The fruit,\r\nwhen full-grown, is from six to nine inches round, and of an oval\r\nform--when ripe, of a rich, yellow tinge; it generally hangs in\r\nclusters of two or three, on a small thick stalk; the pulp is white,\r\npartly farinaceous, and partly fibrous, but when ripe, becomes yellow\r\nand juicy.\r\n\r\n     _Indented_, toothed like the edge of a saw.\r\n\r\n     _Farinaceous_, mealy, consisting of meal or flour; from\r\n     _farina_, flour.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the Bread-Fruit eaten?\r\n\r\nIt is roasted until the outside is of a brown color and crisp; the\r\npulp has then the consistency of bread, which the taste greatly\r\nresembles; and thus it forms a nourishing food: it is also prepared in\r\nmany different ways, besides that just mentioned. The tree produces\r\nthree, sometimes four crops in a year, and continues bearing for fifty\r\nyears, so that two or three trees are enough for a man\'s yearly\r\nsupply. Its timber, which at first is of a rich yellow, but afterwards\r\nassumes the color of mahogany, is used in the building of houses and\r\ncanoes; the flowers, when dried, serve as tinder; the sap or juice\r\nserves for glue; the inner bark is made, by the natives of some of the\r\nislands of the Pacific Ocean, into a kind of cloth; and the leaves are\r\nuseful for many purposes. One species of the bread-fruit, called the\r\nJaca tree, grows chiefly on the mainland of Asia.\r\n\r\n     _Mainland_, the continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the Jaca Tree.\r\n\r\nThis kind grows to the same, if not a larger size than the bread-fruit\r\nof the islands, but is neither so palatable nor so nutritious; the\r\nfruit often weighs thirty pounds, and contains two or three hundred\r\nseeds, each four times as large as an almond. December is the time\r\nwhen the fruit ripens; it is then eaten, but not much relished; the\r\nseeds are also eaten when roasted. There are also other trees in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, mostly of the palm species, which yield\r\nbread of a similar kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there not a tree which produces a substance resembling the Butter\r\nwhich we make from the milk of the cow?\r\n\r\nThe Shea, or Butter Tree, a native of Africa: it is similar in\r\nappearance to the American oak, and the fruit, (from the kernel of\r\nwhich the butter is prepared,) is somewhat like an olive in form. The\r\nkernel is inclosed in a sweet pulp, under a thin, green rind.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the Butter extracted?\r\n\r\nThe kernel, being taken out and dried in the sun, is boiled in water;\r\nby which process a white, firm, and rich-flavored butter is produced,\r\nwhich will keep for a whole year without salt. The growth and\r\npreparation of this commodity is one of the first objects of African\r\nindustry, and forms a principal article of their trade with one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have given me an account of a useful Butter prepared from a plant;\r\nis there not also a tree which can supply the want of a cow?\r\n\r\nIn South America there is a tree, the juice of which is a nourishing\r\nmilk; it is called the Cow Tree. This tree is very fine; the leaves\r\nare broad, and some of them ten inches long; the fruit is rather\r\nfleshy, and contains one or two nuts or kernels. The milk is very\r\nabundant, and is procured by incisions made in the trunk of the tree;\r\nit is tolerably thick, and of a glutinous quality, a pleasant taste,\r\nand agreeable smell. The negroes and people at work on the farms drink\r\nit, dipping into it their bread made of maize.\r\n\r\n     _Glutinous_, having the quality of glue,--an adhesive, gummy\r\n     substance, prepared from the skins of animals: it is used in\r\n     joining wood, &c., and for many other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat time of the day is the best for drawing the juice?\r\n\r\nSunrise; the blacks and natives then hasten from all quarters with\r\nlarge bowls to receive the milk; some drink it on the spot, others\r\ncarry it home to their families.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat island possesses a remarkable substitute for the want of springs\r\nof Water?\r\n\r\nFerro, one of the Canary Isles, situated in the Atlantic Ocean. In\r\nthis island there is no water, except on a part of the beach which is\r\nnearly inaccessible; to supply the place of a fountain, Nature has\r\nbestowed on the island a particular kind of tree, unknown in other\r\nparts of the world. It is of a moderate size, with straight, long,\r\nevergreen leaves; on its top a small cloud continually rests, which so\r\ndrenches the leaves with moisture, that it perpetually distils upon\r\nthe ground a stream of clear water. To these trees, as to perennial\r\nsprings, the inhabitants of Ferro repair, and are supplied with\r\nabundance of water for themselves and cattle.\r\n\r\n     _Perennial_, lasting through the year, perpetual.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Licorice?\r\n\r\nA plant, the juice of which is squeezed from the roots, and then\r\nboiled with sugar, and used as a remedy for coughs, &c. Great\r\nquantities are exported from Spain, Italy, &c. The dried root is of\r\ngreat use in medicine, and makes an excellent drink for colds and\r\nother affections of the lungs by boiling it with linseed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the Lungs?\r\n\r\nThe organs of respiration in man and many other animals. There are two\r\nof these organs, one on each side of the chest.\r\n\r\n     _Respiration_, breathing; the act of inhaling air into the lungs,\r\n     and again expelling it, by which animal life is supported.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Manna?\r\n\r\nA sweet, white juice, oozing from the branches and leaves of a kind of\r\nash tree, growing chiefly in the southern parts of Italy, during the\r\nheats of summer. When dry, it is very light, easily crumbled, and of a\r\nwhitish, or pale yellow color, not unlike hardened honey.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Manna peculiar to the Ash Tree of Southern Italy?\r\n\r\nNo. Manna is nothing more than the nutritious juices of the tree,\r\nwhich exude during the summer heats; and what confirms this is, that\r\nthe very hot summers are always those which are most productive of\r\nmanna. Several different species of trees produce a kind of manna; the\r\nbest and most used is, however, that of Calabria, in Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are its uses?\r\n\r\nIt was much esteemed formerly in medicine, but it has now gone nearly\r\ninto disuse. The peasants of Mount Libanus eat it as others do honey.\r\nThe Bedouin Arabs consume great quantities, considering it the\r\ngreatest dainty their country affords. In Mexico, they are said to\r\nhave a manna which they eat as we do cheese. At Brian\xc3\xa7on, in France,\r\nthey collect it from all sorts of trees that grow there, and the\r\ninhabitants observe, that such summers as produce the greatest\r\nquantities of manna are very fatal to the trees, many of them\r\nperishing in the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there not another tree which produces Manna?\r\n\r\nYes: the Tamarisk, a tree peculiar to Palestine and parts of Arabia.\r\nThis remarkable substance is produced by several trees, and in various\r\ncountries of the East. On Mount Sinai there is a different species of\r\nTamarisk that yields it. It is found on the branches of the tree, and\r\nfalls on the ground during the heat of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Mount Libanus?\r\n\r\nMount Libanus, or Lebanon, is situated in Asiatic Turkey; it was\r\nanciently famous for its large and beautiful cedar trees. The "Cedars\r\nof Lebanon" are frequently mentioned in Holy Writ. There are now\r\nscarcely any remaining of superior size and antiquity, but they vary\r\nfrom the largest size down to mere saplings; and their numbers seem to\r\nincrease rather than diminish, there being many young trees springing\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is Manna gathered?\r\n\r\nFrom August to September, the Italians collect it in the following\r\nmanner, _viz._: by making an incision at the foot of the tree, each day\r\nover that of the preceding, about four inches from one another: these\r\ncuts, or incisions, are nearly two inches long, and half an inch deep.\r\nWhen the cut is made, the manna directly begins to flow, at first like\r\nclear water, but congealing as it flows, it soon becomes firm: this\r\nthey collect in baskets. Manna has been found to consist of two\r\ndistinct substances one nearly resembling sugar, the other similar to\r\na gum or mucilage.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat nation was fed with a kind of Manna?\r\n\r\nThe Children of Israel, when wandering in the desert wilderness, where\r\nno food was to be procured, were fed by a miraculous supply of manna,\r\nshowered down from Heaven every morning on the ground in such\r\nquantities as to afford sufficient food for the whole host.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Opium?\r\n\r\nA narcotic, gummy, resinous juice, drawn from the head of the white\r\npoppy, and afterwards thickened; it is brought over in dark, reddish\r\nbrown lumps, which, when powdered, become yellow.\r\n\r\n     _Narcotic_, producing sleep and drowsiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what countries is it cultivated?\r\n\r\nIn many parts of Asia, India, and even the southern parts of Europe,\r\nwhence it is exported into other countries. The Turks, and other\r\nEastern nations, chew it. With us it is chiefly used in medicine. The\r\njuice is obtained from incisions made in the seed-vessels of the\r\nplant; it is collected in earthen pots, and allowed to become\r\nsufficiently hard to be formed into roundish masses of about four\r\npounds weight. In Europe the poppy is cultivated mostly for the seeds.\r\nMorphia and laudanum are medicinal preparations of opium.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Tobacco?\r\n\r\nAn herbaceous plant which flourishes in many temperate climates,\r\nparticularly in North America; it is supposed to have received its\r\nname from Tabaco, a province of Mexico; it is cultivated in the West\r\nIndies, the Levant, on the coast of Greece, in the Archipelago, Malta,\r\nItaly, France, Ceylon, &c. It was not known in Europe till the\r\ndiscovery of America by the Spaniards; and was carried to England\r\nabout the time of Queen Elizabeth, either by Sir Francis Drake or Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh. Tobacco is either taken as snuff, smoked in pipes or\r\nin the form of cigars, or chewed in the mouth like opium. There are\r\nmany different species of this plant, most of them natives of America,\r\nsome of the Cape of Good Hope and China. Tobacco contains a powerful\r\npoison called nicotine.\r\n\r\n     _Herbaceous_, like an herb or plant, not a shrub or tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat part of the plant is used?\r\n\r\nThe leaves, which are stripped from the plant, and after being\r\nmoistened with water, are twisted up into rolls; these are cut up by\r\nthe tobacconist, and variously prepared for sale, or reduced into a\r\nscented powder called snuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Sir Francis Drake?\r\n\r\nSir Francis Drake was a distinguished naval officer, who flourished in\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth. He made his name immortal by a voyage into the\r\nSouth Seas, through the Straits of Magellan; which, at that time, no\r\nEnglishman had ever attempted. He died on board his own ship in the\r\nWest Indies, 1595.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Sir Walter Raleigh?\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh was also an illustrious English navigator and\r\nhistorian, born in 1552. He performed great services for Queen\r\nElizabeth, particularly in the discovery of Virginia, and in the\r\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada; he lived in honor and prosperity during\r\nher reign, but on the accession of James the First, was stripped of\r\nhis favor at court, unaccountably accused of high treason, tried, and\r\ncondemned to die; being reprieved, however, he was imprisoned in the\r\nTower of London many years, during which time he devoted himself to\r\nwriting and study. Receiving, at last, a commission to go and explore\r\nthe gold mines at Guiana, he embarked; but his design having been\r\nbetrayed to the Spaniards, he was defeated: and on his return to\r\nEngland, in July, 1618, was arrested and beheaded, (by order of the\r\nKing, on his former attainder,) October 29; suffering his fate with\r\ngreat magnanimity.\r\n\r\n     _High Treason_, in England, means an offence committed\r\n     against the sovereign. In the United States it consists in\r\n     levying war against the government, adhering to its enemies,\r\n     and giving them aid and comfort.\r\n\r\n     _Reprieved_, respited from sentence of death.\r\n\r\n     _Magnanimity_, greatness of mind, bravery.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Gum?\r\n\r\nA mucilaginous juice, exuding from the bark of certain trees or\r\nplants, drawn thence by the warmth of the sun in the form of a\r\nglutinous matter; and afterwards by the same cause rendered firm and\r\ntenacious. There are many different gums, named after the particular\r\ntree or plant from which they are produced.\r\n\r\n     _Mucilaginous_, consisting of mucilage.\r\n\r\n     _Tenacious_, adhering closely.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the character of Gum?\r\n\r\nGum is capable of being dissolved in water, and forming with it a\r\nviscid transparent fluid; but not in vinous spirits or oil; it burns\r\nin the fire to a black coal, without melting or catching fire; and\r\ndoes not dissolve in water at boiling heat. The name of _gum_ has been\r\ninaccurately given to several species of gum-resins, which consist of\r\nresin and various other substances, flowing from many kinds of trees,\r\nand becoming hard by exposure to the air. These are soluble in dilute\r\nalcohol. Gum is originally a milky liquor, having a greater quantity\r\nof water mixed with its oily parts, and for that reason it dissolves\r\nin either water or oil. Another sort is not oily, and therefore\r\ndissolves in water only, as gum Arabic, the gum of the cherry-tree,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n     _Viscid_, thick, ropy.\r\n\r\n     _Vinous_, having the qualities of wine.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre the last-mentioned sorts properly called Gums?\r\n\r\nNo, though commonly called gums, they are only dried mucilages, which\r\nwere nothing else than the mucilaginous lymph issuing from the vessels\r\nof the tree, in the same manner as it does from mallows, comfrey, and\r\neven from the cucumber; the vessels of which being cut across, yield a\r\nlymph which is plainly mucilaginous, and if well dried, at length\r\nbecomes a kind of gum, or rather, a hardened mucilage.\r\n\r\n     _Lymph_, transparent fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Gum Arabic?\r\n\r\nThe juice of a small tree of the Acacia tribe, growing in Egypt,\r\nArabia Petr\xc3\xa6a, Palestine, and in different parts of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there other plants or trees which produce Gum, besides those\r\nalready mentioned?\r\n\r\nA great number, though not all commonly in use. The leaves of rhubarb,\r\nthe common plum, and even the sloe and the laurel, produce a clear,\r\ntasteless gum; there are also a number of different gums, brought from\r\nforeign countries, of great use in medicine and the arts. Most of the\r\nAcacias produce gums, though the quality of all is not equally good.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Rhubarb?\r\n\r\nA valuable root growing in China, Turkey, and Russian Tartary.\r\nQuantities of it are imported from other parts of the world: that from\r\nTurkey is esteemed the best. Rhubarb is also cultivated in our\r\ngardens, and the stalks of the leaves are often used in tarts; but the\r\nroot, from the difference of climate, does not possess any medicinal\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSPECTACLES, MARINER\'S COMPASS, BAROMETER, THERMOMETER, WATCHES,\r\nCLOCKS, TELESCOPE, MICROSCOPE, GUNPOWDER, STEAM ENGINE, AND\r\nELECTRO-MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen were Spectacles invented, and who was their inventor?\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that they were first known about the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and invented by a monk of Pisa, in Italy, named Alexander de\r\nSpina. Spectacles are composed of two circular pieces of glass set in\r\na frame.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are these glasses called?\r\n\r\nLenses. They are either convex or concave, according to the kind of\r\nsight requiring them. Old people, and those who can only see things at\r\na distance, from the flatness of the eye, which prevents the rays of\r\nlight converging so as to meet in the centre, require convex lenses.\r\nPeople who can only distinguish objects when viewed closely, from the\r\neye being too convex, require concave lenses to counteract it by\r\nspreading the rays, and thus rendering vision distinct.\r\n\r\n     _Convex_, rising outwardly in a circular form; opposite to\r\n     concave.\r\n\r\n     _Concave_, hollow; round, but hollow, as the inner curve of\r\n     an arch, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Converging_, tending to one point from different parts.\r\n\r\n     _Vision_, the faculty of seeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Mariner\'s Compass?\r\n\r\nA most useful and important instrument, by the aid of which the\r\nnavigator guides his ship on the sea, and steers his way to the place\r\nof his destination. The inventor of the Mariner\'s Compass is not\r\nknown, nor the exact time of its introduction; it was employed in\r\nEurope in navigation about the middle of the thirteenth century, and\r\nhas been in use more than five hundred years. The Chinese are said to\r\nhave been acquainted with it much earlier, but no reliance can be\r\nplaced on their dates. The power of the loadstone to attract iron was\r\nknown to the ancient Egyptians, but it was not applied to any\r\npractical purpose.\r\n\r\n     _Navigator_, one who guides a ship.\r\n\r\n     _Steer_, to direct or guide a vessel in its course.\r\n\r\n     _Destination_, the place to which a person is bound.\r\n\r\n     _Practical_, capable of practice, not merely speculative.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Loadstone?\r\n\r\nAn ore of iron which possesses the peculiar property of attracting\r\niron, namely, of drawing it in contact with its own mass, and holding\r\nit firmly attached by its own power of attraction. A piece of\r\nloadstone drawn several times along a needle, or a small piece of\r\niron, converts it into an artificial magnet; if this magnetized needle\r\nis carefully balanced, it will turn round of itself, till its end\r\npoints towards the North. The magnetized needle also possesses the\r\npower of attracting iron, and of communicating this power to another\r\npiece of iron or steel, similar to that of the loadstone itself.\r\n\r\n     _Contact_, touch.\r\n\r\n     _Magnetized_, rendered magnetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the Mariner\'s Compass.\r\n\r\nThe Mariner\'s Compass consists of a circular box, enclosing a\r\nmagnetized bar of steel, called the _needle_, carefully balanced on an\r\nupright steel pivot, and having that end which points to the North\r\nshaped like the head of an arrow; attached to this needle, and turning\r\nwith it, is a card on which are printed the divisions of North, South.\r\nEast, and West; called the points of the compass. By simply looking at\r\nthe position of the needle, the mariner can see the direction in which\r\nhis vessel is sailing, and regulate his helm accordingly.\r\n\r\n     _Helm_, the instrument by which a ship is steered,\r\n     consisting of a rudder and tiller.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Barometer?\r\n\r\nAn instrument for measuring the weight of the atmosphere, which\r\nenables us to determine the changes of the weather, the height of\r\nmountains, &c. It consists of a glass tube hermetically sealed at one\r\nend, filled with mercury, and inverted in a basin of mercury;\r\naccording to the weight of the atmosphere, this mercury rises or\r\nfalls.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the Hermetic seal formed?\r\n\r\nBy heating the edges of a vessel, till they are just ready to melt,\r\nand then twisting them closely together with hot pincers, so that the\r\nair may be totally excluded. The word is taken from Hermes, the Greek\r\nname for Mercury, the heathen god of arts and learning, and the\r\nsupposed inventor of chemistry,[9] which is sometimes called the\r\nhermetical art; or perhaps from Hermes, an ancient king of Egypt, who\r\nwas either its inventor, or excelled in it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See Chapter XVIII., article Chemistry.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Mercury?\r\n\r\nQuicksilver, or mercury, is a white fluid metal, the heaviest except\r\nplatina and gold; it readily combines with nearly all other metals,\r\nand is used in the manufacture of looking-glasses, barometers,\r\nthermometers, &c.; in some of the arts, and in the preparation of\r\nseveral powerful medicines. It is found in California, Hungary,\r\nSweden, Spain, China, and Peru. The quicksilver mine of Guan\xc3\xa7a Velica,\r\nin Peru, is one hundred and seventy fathoms in circumference, and four\r\nhundred and eighty deep. In this profound abyss are seen streets,\r\nsquares, and a chapel, where religious worship is performed. The\r\nquicksilver mines of Idria, a town of Lower Austria, have continually\r\nbeen wrought for more than 300 years. The vapor which is continually\r\narising from the mercury is very hurtful to the miners, who seldom\r\nsurvive many years.\r\n\r\n     _Abyss_, a gulf, a depth without bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what state is Mercury usually found?\r\n\r\nEither native, or in the form of ore; it is often found mixed with\r\nsilver, but more frequently with sulphur in the form of sulphuret,\r\nwhich is decomposed by distillation. Running mercury is found in\r\nglobules, in America, and is collected from the clefts of the rocks.\r\nMercury has the appearance of melted silver; it is neither ductile nor\r\nmalleable in this state; it is a substance so volatile, when heated,\r\nthat it may be evaporated like water; it is always seen in a fluid\r\nstate, even in temperate climates, as a very small portion of heat is\r\nsufficient to preserve its fluidity. It is used to separate gold and\r\nsilver from the foreign matter found with those metals. Calomel, a\r\nvaluable medicine, and vermilion, a color, are both preparations of\r\nmercury.\r\n\r\n     _Globules_, small particles of matter having the form of a\r\n     ball or sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Thermometer?\r\n\r\nAn instrument for measuring temperature. It consists of a fine glass\r\ntube, terminated at one end in a bulb, usually filled with mercury,\r\nwhich expands or contracts according to the degree of heat or cold. On\r\nthe scale of the Fahrenheit thermometer, the freezing point of water\r\nis marked 32\xc2\xb0 and the boiling point at 212\xc2\xb0. In both the Centigrade\r\nand the Reaumur scales the freezing point is at 0, and the boiling\r\npoint at 100\xc2\xb0 in the Centigrade and at 80\xc2\xb0 in Reaumur\'s. The invention\r\nof this instrument dates from about the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury; but it is not known by whom it was first brought into use.\r\n\r\n     _Terminated_, finished, ended.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen and by whom were Watches and Clocks invented?\r\n\r\nWatches were invented about the year 1500, but who was the inventor is\r\ndisputed. They were, however, of little value as time-keepers, before\r\nthe application of the spiral spring as a regulator to the balance;\r\nthe glory of this excellent invention lies between Dr. Hooke and M.\r\nHuygens; the English ascribing it to the former, the Dutch, French,\r\n&c., to the latter. Some assert that pocket-watches were first made\r\nabout 1477, at Nuremberg, in Germany. The most ancient clock of which\r\nwe possess any certain account, was made in 1634 by Henry de Wycke, a\r\nGerman artist; it was erected in a tower of the palace of Charles V.,\r\nking of France. The pendulum was applied by Huygens, in 1656.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Pendulum?\r\n\r\nA weight so suspended from a fixed point that it may easily swing\r\nbackward and forward; its oscillations are always performed in equal\r\ntimes, provided the length of the pendulum and the gravity remain the\r\nsame. It is said that the idea of employing the pendulum for the\r\nmeasurement of time, was first conceived by Galileo, while a young\r\nman, upon his observing attentively the regular oscillations of a lamp\r\nsuspended from the roof of a church in Pisa. It was not, however, till\r\nthe time of Huygens that a method was devised of continuing its\r\nmotions, and registering the number of its oscillations.\r\n\r\n     _Oscillation_, a swinging backward and forward.\r\n\r\n     _Gravity_, the tendency of a body toward the centre of the\r\n     earth.\r\n\r\n     _Registering_, recording.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARCOAL BURNING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD MINERS WASHING ORE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo whom is the invention of Gunpowder ascribed?\r\n\r\nMost authors suppose it was invented by Bartholdus Schwartz, a monk of\r\nGoslar, a town of Brunswick, in Germany, about the year 1320; it\r\nappears, however, that it was known much earlier in many parts of the\r\nworld, and that the famous Roger Bacon, who died in 1292, knew its\r\nproperties; but it is not certain that he was acquainted with its\r\napplication to fire-arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Roger Bacon?\r\n\r\nA learned Franciscan, born at Ilchester, England, in 1214. He studied\r\nat Oxford, and afterwards became professor at that great University.\r\nHe was familiar with every branch of human knowledge, but was\r\nespecially distinguished for his extraordinary proficiency in the\r\nnatural sciences. To him we owe the invention of the telescope; that\r\nof gunpowder is ascribed to him, as stated above, although we have no\r\nevidence to show whether he discovered its ingredients himself, or\r\nwhether he derived the knowledge from some ancient manuscripts. Bacon\r\nsuffered some from the ignorance of the age in which he lived, many of\r\nhis experiments being looked upon as magic. He died at Oxford in the\r\nyear 1294.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is understood by Magic?\r\n\r\nMagic is a term used to signify an unlawful and wicked kind of\r\nscience, depending, as was pretended, on the assistance of superhuman\r\nbeings and of departed souls. The term was anciently applied to all\r\nkinds of learning, and in particular to the science of the Magi or\r\nWise Men of Persia, from whom it was called magic. _Natural_ magic is\r\nno more than the application of natural active causes to passive\r\nthings or subjects, to produce effects apparently supernatural.\r\n\r\n     _Supernatural_, beyond the powers of nature; miraculous.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what is Gunpowder composed?\r\n\r\nOf saltpetre,[10] sulphur, and charcoal, mixed together and powdered;\r\nits explosive force when fired, is owing to the instantaneous and\r\nabundant liberation of gaseous matter by the intense heat resulting\r\nfrom the action of the combustibles upon the saltpetre. It is not\r\nknown by whom it was first applied to the purposes of war, but it is\r\ncertain that it was used early in the fourteenth century. Cannons were\r\nused at the battle of Cressy, in 1346; small guns, or muskets, were\r\nintroduced into the Spanish army in 1521.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See Chapter XIII.]\r\n\r\n     _Explosive_, bursting out with violence and noise.\r\n\r\n     _Liberation_, a setting at liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not Gunpowder highly combustible?\r\n\r\nSo combustible is gunpowder, that a single spark of fire, lighting\r\nupon any of it, will cause it to explode with immense force; and\r\ninstances have occurred, when any store or magazine of it has taken\r\nfire, that have been attended with the most fatal effects. It is\r\nuseful to the miner and engineer as a ready means of overcoming the\r\nobstacles which are presented in their search for mineral treasures,\r\nand in procuring materials for building. From many passages in the\r\nancient authors, there is reason to suppose that gunpowder, or a\r\ncomposition extremely like it, was known to them; but it does not\r\nappear to have been in general use, and the invention of fire-arms is\r\ncomparatively modern. Dynamite, a recent invention, has a still\r\ngreater explosive force than gunpowder.\r\n\r\n     _Engineer_, one who works or directs an engine.\r\n\r\n     _Obstacles_, hinderances, obstructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Saltpetre?\r\n\r\nA bitter kind of salt, called by the ancients nitre, but more commonly\r\namong us saltpetre. It is composed of nitric acid and potassa.[11] It\r\nis found in earthy substances; sometimes native or pure, in the form\r\nof a shapeless salt. Vast quantities are found in several of the\r\nmarly earths of the East Indies, China, Persia, and also in South\r\nAmerica. In India it is found naturally crystallized, and forming thin\r\ncrusts upon the surface of the earth. It is especially abundant in the\r\nUnited States, being found in immense quantities in the limestone\r\ncaves in the south-western States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: See Potash, Chapter VII., article Glass.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by _Marly_?\r\n\r\nConsisting of marl, a kind of earth composed of different proportions\r\nof clay and carbonate of lime; it is much used for manure. There are\r\nseveral different-colored marls, each possessing different qualities.\r\nThe most common are the red and the white, though there are grey,\r\nbrown, blue, and yellow colored marls.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Telescope?\r\n\r\nAn optical instrument, which serves for discovering and viewing\r\ndistant objects, either directly by glasses, or by reflection. The\r\ninvention of the telescope is one of the noblest and most useful of\r\nwhich modern ages can boast, since by means of this instrument the\r\nwonderful motions of the planets and fixed stars, and all the heavenly\r\nbodies, are revealed to us. The honor of the invention is much\r\ndisputed; it is certain, however, that the celebrated Galileo was the\r\nfirst who improved the telescope so as to answer astronomical\r\npurposes. The name is formed from two Greek words, one signifying\r\n_far_, the other _to observe_.\r\n\r\n     _Optical_, relating to Optics, the science of vision.\r\n\r\n     _Astronomical_, relating to Astronomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Galileo?\r\n\r\nA most eminent astronomer and mathematician, born at Florence, in\r\nItaly. His inventions and discoveries in Astronomy, Geometry, and\r\nMechanics, contributed much to the advancement of those sciences. He\r\ndied in 1642.\r\n\r\n     _Astronomer_, one versed in Astronomy.\r\n\r\n     _Mathematician_, one versed in Mathematics; a science which\r\n     treats of magnitude and number.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Astronomy?[12]\r\n\r\nThat science which teaches the knowledge of the heavenly bodies, with\r\nthe nature and causes of their various phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See Chapter xviii.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Geometry?\r\n\r\nAn ancient, perfect, and beautiful science, which treats of the\r\nrelations and properties of lines, surfaces, and solids.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by Mechanics?\r\n\r\nThe science which investigates the laws of forces and powers, and\r\ntheir action on bodies, either directly or by machinery. When the term\r\n_mechanic_ is applied to a _person_, it means one skilled in\r\nmechanics, accustomed to manual labor.\r\n\r\n     _Investigate_, to search, to inquire into.\r\n\r\n     _Manual_, performed by the hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Microscope?\r\n\r\nAn optical instrument, by means of which very minute objects are\r\nrepresented exceedingly large, and viewed very distinctly according to\r\nthe laws of refraction or reflection. Nothing certain is known\r\nrespecting the inventor of microscopes, or the exact time of their\r\ninvention, but that they were first used in Germany, about 1621.\r\n\r\n     _Minute_, small, diminutive.\r\n\r\n     _Refraction_, a change in the direction of a ray of light,\r\n     when it passes through transparent substances of different\r\n     densities.\r\n\r\n     _Reflection_, a turning back of a ray of light after\r\n     striking upon any surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Steam Engine?\r\n\r\nA machine that derives its moving power from the force of the steam\r\nproduced from boiling water, which is very great, especially when, as\r\nin the steam engine, it is confined within a limited compass: this\r\nuseful machine is one of the most valuable presents that the arts of\r\nlife have received from the philosopher, and is of the greatest\r\nimportance in working mines; supplying cities with water; in working\r\nmetals; in many mechanical arts; and in navigation. By the aid of\r\nsteam, vessels are propelled with greater swiftness than those which\r\nare wholly dependent on the winds and tides; and thus trade is\r\nfacilitated, and we are enabled to communicate with distant lands in a\r\nmuch shorter space of time than was formerly consumed. On land,\r\nrailroads are constructed, on which steam carriages run with\r\nastonishing rapidity, so that a journey which by coach and horses\r\nformerly required two or more days, may now be performed in four or\r\nfive hours.\r\n\r\n     _Mechanical_, belonging to Mechanics.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo whom are we indebted for its invention?\r\n\r\nIts invention is by most writers ascribed to the Marquis of Worcester,\r\nan Englishman, about 1663; but it does not appear that the inventor\r\ncould ever interest the public in favor of this, or his other\r\ndiscoveries. The steam engine of Captain Savery, also an Englishman,\r\nis the first of which any definite description has been preserved. It\r\nwas invented in 1698. Since that period it has been successively\r\nimproved by various persons, but it is to Mr. Watt and Mr. Boulton, of\r\nEngland, that it is indebted for much of its present state of\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy whom was the Steam Engine first applied to the purposes of\r\nNavigation?\r\n\r\nBy John Fitch, of Pennsylvania. From papers in the historical\r\ncollections of Pennsylvania, it appears that the first successful\r\nexperiments were made at Philadelphia, in 1785, three years before the\r\nattempts at Falkirk, and on the Clyde, in Scotland. The boat made\r\nseveral trips on the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, but owing to\r\nrepeated accidents to her machinery, and the want of funds and\r\ncompetent mechanics for the necessary repairs, she was abandoned. In\r\n1807, Robert Fulton, also of Pennsylvania, made his first experimental\r\ntrip on the Hudson River, with complete success. To this distinguished\r\nand ingenious American justly belongs the honor of having brought\r\nnavigation by steam to a state of perfection. In 1819, the first\r\nsteamship crossed the Atlantic from Savannah to Liverpool; and in\r\n1838, a regular communication by steamship was established between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States. Since that period, ocean\r\nnavigation by steam-vessels has made rapid progress, and, at the\r\npresent time, numbers of steamers connect our various seaports with\r\nthose of other nations, and with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Electro-Magnetic Telegraph?\r\n\r\nAn instrument, or apparatus, by means of which intelligence is\r\nconveyed to any distance with the velocity of lightning. The electric\r\nfluid, when an excess has accumulated in one place, always seeks to\r\ntransfer itself to another, until an equilibrium of its distribution\r\nis fully restored. Consequently, when two places are connected by\r\nmeans of a good conductor of electricity, as, for instance, the\r\ntelegraphic wire; the fluid generated by a galvanic battery, if the\r\ncommunication be rendered complete, instantaneously traverses the\r\nwhole extent of the wire, and charges, at the distant station, an\r\nelectro-magnet; this attracts one end of a lever, and draws it\r\ndownward, while the other extremity is thrown up, and, by means of a\r\nstyle, marks a slip of paper, which is steadily wound off from a\r\nroller by the aid of clock-work. If the communication is immediately\r\nbroken, only one wave of electricity passes over, and a _dot_ is made\r\nupon the paper; if kept up, a _line_ is marked. These dots and lines\r\nare made to represent the letters of the alphabet, so that an operator\r\nemployed for the purpose can easily read the message which is\r\ntransmitted.--The Electro-Magnetic Telegraph was first introduced upon\r\na line between Baltimore and Washington, by Professor Morse, in 1844;\r\nat the present time, it is in successful operation between nearly all\r\nthe important cities and towns of the United States and of Europe.\r\n\r\n     An _Electro-Magnet_ is a piece of soft iron, rendered\r\n     temporarily magnetic by being placed within a coil of wire\r\n     through which a current of electricity is passing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nSOAP, CANDLES, TALLOW TREE, SPERMACETI, WAX, MAHOGANY, INDIAN\r\nRUBBER OR CAOUTCHOUC, SPONGE, CORAL, LIME, CARBON, OXYGEN, NITROGEN,\r\nGAS, HYDROGEN, CHALK, AND MARBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what is Soap composed?\r\n\r\nOf soda or potash, and various oily substances; it is so useful for\r\ndomestic and other purposes, that it may be regarded as one of the\r\nnecessaries of life; immense quantities of it are consumed in all\r\ncivilized countries. Soft soap is generally made of a lye of\r\nwood-ashes and quicklime, boiled up with tallow or oil; common\r\nhousehold soap of soda and tallow, or of potash and tallow; when\r\npotash is used, a large portion of common salt, which contains soda,\r\nis added to harden it. The finest white soaps are made of olive oil\r\nand a lye consisting of soda and quicklime; perfumes are sometimes\r\nadded, or various coloring matters stirred in to give the soap a\r\nvariegated appearance. The ancient Greeks and Hebrews appear to have\r\nbeen acquainted with the art of making soap, or a composition very\r\nsimilar to it; and also the ancient Gauls and Germans. A soap-boiler\'s\r\nshop, with soap in it, was found in the city of Pompeii, in Italy,\r\nwhich was overwhelmed by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius, A.D. 79.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Soda?\r\n\r\nSoda, or barilla, is obtained from the ashes of marine plants, and by\r\nthe decomposition of common salt; its great depository is the ocean,\r\nsoda being the basis of salt. The marine plants from which the soda is\r\nobtained, are endowed with the property of decomposing the sea-salt\r\nwhich they imbibe, and of absorbing the soda which it contains. It is\r\nfound native in Egypt, and is there called _natron_; a name similar to\r\nthat which it bore among the Jews and Greeks.\r\n\r\n     _Depository_, store-house, place where anything is lodged.\r\n\r\n     _Imbibe_, to drink in, to absorb.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what are Candles made?\r\n\r\nOf Tallow, which means animal fat melted and clarified, that is,\r\ncleansed or purified from filth. Tallow is procured from many animals,\r\nbut the most esteemed, and the most used, is that made from oxen,\r\nsheep, swine, goats, deer, bears, &c.; some of which tallows or fats\r\nare used in medicine, some in making soap, and dressing leather;\r\nothers in the manufacture of candles, &c. For the last-mentioned\r\narticle, that of sheep and oxen is most used; candles of a better sort\r\nare likewise made of wax and spermaceti. Candles are kept burning by\r\nmeans of a wick of cotton or rush, placed in the centre of the tallow,\r\nwhich is moulded into a cylindrical form.\r\n\r\n     _Cylindrical_, having the form of a cylinder.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there not a tree which yields a vegetable Tallow?\r\n\r\nYes; China possesses a tree producing a substance like our tallow, of\r\nwhich the Chinese make their candles; this tallow is extracted from\r\nthe stone of the fruit, the tallow being a white pulp which surrounds\r\nit. In America, likewise, there is a shrub, a native of the temperate\r\nparts, especially towards the sea-side, the seeds of which contain a\r\nwaxy substance used for the same purpose, and which is extracted by\r\nboiling; this shrub is a species of myrtle, and does not attain to any\r\ngreat size.\r\n\r\n     _Extracted_, drawn from.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Spermaceti?\r\n\r\nA whitish, flaky, unctuous substance, prepared from an oil of the same\r\nname, drawn from a particular kind of whale, distinguished from the\r\ncommon whale by having teeth, and a hunch on its back.\r\n\r\n     _Flaky_, having the nature of flakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Wax?\r\n\r\nA soft, yellow, concrete matter, collected from vegetables by the\r\nbee, of which this industrious and useful insect constructs its cell.\r\nWax forms a considerable article of trade; it is of two kinds, the\r\nyellow and the white; the yellow is the native wax as it is taken from\r\nthe hive, and the white is the same washed, purified, and exposed to\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n     _Concrete_, grown together, solid.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Tree produces the beautiful and well-known wood so much used in\r\nmaking the various articles of household furniture?\r\n\r\nThe Mahogany Tree, growing in America, and the East and West Indies;\r\nit frequently grows in the crevices of rocks, and other places of the\r\nsame description. This wood was not used for making furniture till\r\nnear the end of the seventeenth century. A London physician had a\r\nbrother, the captain of a West India ship, who, on his return to\r\nEngland, having on board several logs of mahogany for the purpose of\r\nballast, made him a present of the wood, he being engaged in a\r\nbuilding project; his carpenter, however, threw it aside, observing\r\nthat it was too hard to be wrought. Some time after, the lady of the\r\nphysician being in want of a box to hold candles, the cabinet-maker\r\nwas directed to make it of this wood; he also made the same objection,\r\nand declared that it spoiled his tools. Being urged, however, to make\r\nanother trial, he at length succeeded; when the box was polished, the\r\nbeautiful color of the wood was so novel, that it became an object of\r\ngreat curiosity. Before this time, mahogany had been used partially in\r\nthe West Indies for ship-building, but this new discovery of its\r\nbeauty soon brought it into general use for making furniture.\r\n\r\n     _Crevice_, a rent, a crack.\r\n\r\n     _Ballast_, the heavy matter placed in the hold of a vessel\r\n     to keep it steady.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is India Rubber or Caoutchouc?\r\n\r\nAn elastic, resinous substance, produced from a tree, growing\r\nabundantly at Cayenne, Quito, and other parts of South America; and\r\nalso in some parts of the Indies. The tree which produces it is\r\nlarge, straight, and about sixty feet high. There is, however, a small\r\nspecies found in Sumatra and Java, and some of the neighboring\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the Caoutchouc obtained from the Tree?\r\n\r\nBy making incisions in the trunk of the tree, from which the fluid\r\nresin issues in great abundance, appearing of a milky whiteness at\r\nfirst, but gradually becoming of a dark reddish color, soft and\r\nelastic to the touch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what use is this substance put?\r\n\r\nThe Indians make of it boots, shoes, bottles, flambeaux, and a species\r\nof cloth. Amongst us it is combined with sulphur, forming the\r\nvulcanized rubber of commerce, which is used for many purposes. A\r\ngreater proportion of sulphur, produces vulcanite, a hard black\r\nsubstance, resembling jet.\r\n\r\n     _Flambeaux_, torches burnt to give light.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Sponge?\r\n\r\nA marine substance, found adhering to rocks and shells under the\r\nsea-water, or on the sides of rocks near the shore. Sponge was\r\nformerly imagined by some naturalists to be a vegetable production; by\r\nothers, a mineral, or a collection of sea-mud, but it has since been\r\ndiscovered to be the fabric and habitation of a species of worm, or\r\npolypus.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by Polypus?\r\n\r\nA species of animals called Zoophytes, by which are meant beings\r\nhaving such an admixture of the characteristics of both plants and\r\nanimals, as to render it difficult to decide to which division they\r\nproperly belong. They are animal in substance, possessed indeed of a\r\nstomach, but without the other animal characteristics of\r\nblood-vessels, bones, or organs of sense; these creatures live chiefly\r\nin water, and are mostly incapable of motion: they increase by buds or\r\nexcrescences from the parent zoophyte, and if cut off will grow again\r\nand multiply; each part becoming a perfect animal. Myriads of the\r\ndifferent species of zoophytes reside in small cells of coral, sponge,\r\n&c., or in forms like plants, and multiply in such numbers as to\r\ncreate rocks and whole islands in many seas, by their untiring\r\nindustry. Polypus signifies having many feet, or roots; it is derived\r\nfrom the Greek.\r\n\r\n     _Myriads_, countless numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence are the best and greatest number of Sponges brought?\r\n\r\nFrom the Mediterranean, especially from Nicaria, an island near the\r\ncoast of Asia: the collection of sponges forms, in some of these\r\nislands, the principal support of their inhabitants. They are procured\r\nby diving under water, an exercise in which both men, women, and\r\nchildren are skilled from their earliest years. The fine, small\r\nsponges are esteemed the best, and usually come from Constantinople;\r\nthe larger and coarser sorts are brought from Tunis and Algiers, on\r\nthe coast of Africa. Sponge is very useful in the arts, as well as for\r\ndomestic purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Coral?\r\n\r\nA substance which, like sponge, was considered as a vegetable\r\nproduction, until about the year 1720, when a French gentleman of\r\nMarseilles commenced (and continued for thirty years,) a series of\r\nobservations, and ascertained that the coral was a living animal of\r\nthe Polypus tribe. The general name of zoophytes, or plant animals,\r\nhas since been applied to them. These animals are furnished with\r\nminute glands, secreting a milky juice; this juice, when exuded from\r\nthe animal, becomes fixed and hard.\r\n\r\n     _Series_, a course or continued succession.\r\n\r\n     _Glands_, vessels.\r\n\r\n     _Exuded_, from exude, to flow out.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this substance considered by naturalists as the habitation of the\r\nInsect?\r\n\r\nNot merely as the habitation, but as a part of the animal itself, in\r\nthe same manner that the shell of a snail or an oyster is of those\r\nanimals, and without which they cannot long exist. By means of this\r\njuice or secretion, the coral insects, at a vast but unknown depth\r\nbelow the surface of the sea, attach themselves to the points and\r\nridges of rocks, which form the bottom of the ocean; upon which\r\nfoundation the little architects labor, building up, by the aid of the\r\nabove-mentioned secretion, pile upon pile of their rocky habitations,\r\nuntil at length the work rises above the sea, and is continued to such\r\na height as to leave it almost dry, when the insects leave building on\r\nthat part, and begin afresh in another direction under the water. Huge\r\nmasses of rocky substances are thus raised by this wonderful little\r\ninsect, capable of resisting the tremendous power of the ocean when\r\nagitated to the highest pitch by winds or tempests.\r\n\r\n     _Architect_, one who builds.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do these Coral Rocks become Islands?\r\n\r\nAfter the formation of this solid, rocky base, sea-shells, fragments\r\nof coral, and sea-sand, thrown up by each returning tide, are broken\r\nand mixed together by the action of the waves; these, in time, become\r\na sort of stone, and thus raise the surface higher and higher;\r\nmeanwhile, the ever-active surf continues to throw up the shells of\r\nmarine animals and other substances, which fill up the crevices\r\nbetween the stones; the undisturbed sand on its surface offers to the\r\nseeds of trees and plants cast upon it by the waves, a soil upon which\r\nthey rapidly grow and overshadow the dazzling whiteness of the\r\nnew-formed land. Trunks of trees, washed into the sea by the rivers\r\nfrom other countries and islands, here find a resting-place, and with\r\nthese come some small animals, chiefly of the lizard and insect tribe.\r\nEven before the trees form a wood, the sea-birds nestle among their\r\nbranches, and the stray land-bird soon takes refuge in the bushes. At\r\nlast, man arrives and builds his hut upon the fruitful soil formed by\r\nthe corruption of the vegetation, and calls himself lord and master of\r\nthis new creation.\r\n\r\n     _Surf_, the white spray or froth of the sea waves.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is the Coral Insect found?\r\n\r\nIn nearly all great seas; but particularly in the Mediterranean, where\r\nit produces Corallines of the most beautiful forms and colors: it is\r\nin the Pacific Ocean, however, where these tiny workmen are effecting\r\nthose mighty changes, which exceed the most wonderful works of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is that part of the Pacific called, where the Coral Rocks are\r\nmost abundant?\r\n\r\nThe Coral Sea, from the number of coral reefs and sunken islands, with\r\nwhich it abounds; it includes a region of many miles in extent, the\r\nwhole of which is studded with numberless reefs, rocks, islands, and\r\ncolumns of coral, continually joining and advancing towards each\r\nother. All navigators who have visited these seas, state that no\r\ncharts or maps are of any service after a few years, owing to the\r\nnumber of fresh rocks and reefs which are continually rising to the\r\nsurface. The wonderful instinct of these animals leads them to\r\ncontinue working without ceasing, until their labors are finished, or\r\ntheir lives extinct.\r\n\r\n     _Reef_, a chain or line of rocks lying near the surface of\r\n     the water.\r\n\r\n     _Extinct_, at an end, dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the names of the principal islands of Coral formation?\r\n\r\nThe New Hebrides, the Friendly Isles, the Navigator\'s Isles, the\r\nSociety Islands, the Marquesas, the Gambier group, and others. These\r\ngroups are separated from each other by channels or seas, wider than\r\nthose which divide the individual islands which form the respective\r\ngroups; but all these waters abound with shoals and minor islets,\r\nwhich point out the existence of a common base, and show that the work\r\nby which they will afterwards be united above the level of the sea is\r\ncontinually going forward.\r\n\r\n     _Shoals_, shallows; places where the water is of little\r\n     depth.\r\n\r\n     _Minor_, less, smaller than others.\r\n\r\n     _Existence_, being.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a singular characteristic of the Coral Islands?\r\n\r\nOn all of them a plentiful supply of sweet and fresh water may be\r\nobtained by digging three or four feet into the coral; and even within\r\none yard of high-water mark such a supply is to be found. They are\r\nmostly covered with a deep rich soil, and well wooded with trees and\r\nevergreens of different kinds. These islands vary in extent, as well\r\nas in the degree of finish to which they have arrived; some of the\r\nlargest being about 30 miles in diameter, and the smallest something\r\nless than a mile;--all of various shapes, and all formed of living\r\ncoral.\r\n\r\n     _Diameter_, a straight line through the middle of a circle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Coral put to any use by man?\r\n\r\nWhite Coral, which is nowhere so abundant as about the shores of\r\nCeylon, and others of the neighboring Indian coasts, is employed as\r\nlime by the inhabitants of that part of the world, for building\r\nhouses, &c., by burning it after the manner of our lime. This coral\r\nlies in vast banks, which are uncovered at low water. Coral,\r\nparticularly the beautiful red sort, is likewise made into various\r\nornaments, as necklaces, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what is our Lime composed?\r\n\r\nOf a useful earth, which absorbs moisture and carbonic acid, and\r\nexists as limestone, or in marble and chalk, which, when burnt, become\r\nlime: in its native state it is called carbonate of lime, and is burnt\r\nto disengage the carbonic acid; when made into a paste, with one part\r\nwater and three parts lime,[13] and mixed with some other mineral or\r\nmetallic substances, it forms plastic cements and mortars; and\r\nafterwards, imbibing carbonic acid from the atmosphere, it becomes\r\nagain carbonate of lime, as hard as at first; and hence its use in\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See Chapter XVI., article Lime.]\r\n\r\n     _Plastic_, yielding, capable of being spread out or moulded.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by Carbon?\r\n\r\nA simple substance, whose most common form is purified charcoal: it\r\nis, in fact, the base of charcoal, divested of all impurities;\r\ncombined with oxygen, it forms _carbonic acid_ gas, formerly called\r\nfixed air. It is diffused through all animal and vegetable bodies; and\r\nmay be obtained by exposing them to a red heat. In its pure,\r\ncrystallized state, it constitutes the diamond, and as graphite, is\r\nused in making the so-called lead-pencils.[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: See Chapter XIV., article Diamond.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Oxygen?\r\n\r\nAir, mentioned in the first chapter of this work as the gaseous\r\nsubstance which composes the atmosphere, is formed by a mixture of two\r\ndistinct elements, one called Nitrogen, or Azote, the other Oxygen.\r\nOxygen is, therefore, an element or simple substance diffused\r\ngenerally through nature, and its different combinations are essential\r\nto animal life and combustion. It is, in fact, the most active agent\r\nin nature, and the principle of acidity and combustion. So wholesome\r\nand necessary is oxygen to life, that it is often called vital air.\r\n\r\n     _Agent_, an actor; a person or thing possessing the faculty\r\n     of action.\r\n\r\n     _Essential_, necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the properties of Nitrogen or Azote?\r\n\r\nNitrogen is a substance also generally diffused through nature, and\r\nparticularly in animal bodies, and causes great changes in those\r\nabsorbing or exposed to it. This gas, combined with oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, produces neither light, heat, nor combustion, but serves to\r\ndilute the others: of itself, it is hurtful to animal life. Nitrogen\r\nmakes the principal part of the salt we call _nitre_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by Combustion?\r\n\r\nThe decomposition of bodies by the action of fire; the union of\r\ncombustible bodies with the oxygen of the atmosphere. The greater\r\naccess the air has to a burning body, the more rapid and complete is\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\n     _Combustible_, capable of taking fire.\r\n\r\n     _Access_, the means or liberty of approach to anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre all bodies equally combustible?\r\n\r\nNo; some are more so than others, and burn with a bright flame; as\r\nwood, dry vegetables, resins, oils, fats, &c.; others with difficulty,\r\nand without any sensible flame, as soot, coal, the ashes of plants,\r\n&c. There are bodies, also, which are incombustible--that is,\r\nincapable of taking fire, as some alkalies, earths, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Caloric?\r\n\r\nCaloric is that invisible agent which produces the sensation of heat.\r\nIt exists in all bodies; it is a force we are ever in want of, and\r\nthus it is hid in everything around us, and penetrates all matter,\r\nhowever different may be its nature or properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by Gas?\r\n\r\nAll highly elastic fluids are called gases. Some are salutary, but\r\nmany extremely noxious, especially such as those arising from the\r\nputrefaction of animal bodies; the burning of charcoal; corrupted air\r\nat the bottom of mines, cellars, &c. The inflammable gas, which lights\r\nour streets, churches, shops, &c., is procured chiefly from coal,\r\nburnt in furnaces for the purpose the gas being passed through metal\r\npipes, conveyed underground to the places where the light is required:\r\nescaping at the orifice prepared for it, it is lighted when wanted,\r\nand burns with, a brilliant flame. This gas consists of hydrogen and\r\ncarbon; and the oxygen of the air, combined with the hydrogen, causes\r\nlight as long as hydrogen and oxygen exist and combine.\r\n\r\n     _Salutary_, wholesome, healthful.\r\n\r\n     _Noxious_, hurtful, unwholesome.\r\n\r\n     _Putrefaction_, decay.\r\n\r\n     _Orifice_, opening, hole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAMOND CUTTING AND POLISHING.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Hydrogen?\r\n\r\nOne of the most abundant principles in nature; one part of it, and\r\neight of oxygen, form water. It is only met with in a gaseous form;\r\nit is also very inflammable, and is the gas called the fire-damp, so\r\noften fatal to miners; it is the chief constituent of oils, fats,\r\nspirits, &c.; and is produced by the decomposition of water.\r\n\r\n     _Constituent_, that which forms an essential part of\r\n     anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Chalk?\r\n\r\nA white fossil substance, by some reckoned a stone, but of a friable\r\nkind, which cannot, therefore, be polished as marble; by others, more\r\nproperly ranked among the earths. It is of two sorts, one a hard dry\r\nchalk, used for making lime; the other a soft, unctuous kind, used in\r\nmanuring land, &c. Chalk always contains quantities of flint-stone,\r\nand the fossil remains of shells, coral, animal bones, marine plants,\r\n&c.; from which circumstance there can be no doubt that _chalk is the\r\ndeposited mud of a former ocean_. The chemical name of chalk is\r\ncarbonate of lime. It effervesces strongly with an acid.\r\n\r\n     _Effervesce_, to froth or foam up.\r\n\r\n     _Deposited_, placed on anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Chalk found?\r\n\r\nIn large beds or strata in the earth. Chalk, on account of its\r\nabundance in England, forms an important feature in the scenery and\r\ngeology of that country; it causes the whiteness of its sea-cliffs.\r\nScotland and Wales are entirely without chalk. The white chalk is\r\nfound, with interruptions, over a space above eleven hundred miles\r\nlong, extending from the north of Ireland, through England, France,\r\nBelgium, Germany, Poland, and Southern Russia, to the Crimea, with a\r\nbreadth of more than eight hundred miles. The Island of Crete, now\r\ncalled Candia, situated in the Mediterranean, was formerly noted for\r\nits chalk. This substance is very useful in many of the arts and\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is the Crimea?\r\n\r\nThe peninsula of the Crimea is a part of Russia, lying on the Black\r\nSea, by which it is bounded on the west and south.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there any other kinds of this earth besides the common white\r\nchalk?\r\n\r\nYes; there are various kinds of chalk, distinguished by their\r\ndifferent colors, as white, black, red, &c., found in various parts of\r\nthe world, of great use to the painter, both in oil and water colors,\r\nand for drawing on paper, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Marble?\r\n\r\nA kind of stone remarkable for its hardness and firm grain, and for\r\nbeing susceptible of the finest polish. It is dug in great masses from\r\npits or quarries; and is much used in ornamental buildings, and for\r\nstatues, altars, tombs, chimney-pieces, &c. The word is derived from\r\nthe French _marbre_, marble. Marble is supposed to be formed, deep\r\nwithin the bowels of the earth, from a loose and porous carbonate of\r\nlime, subjected to enormous heat and pressure.\r\n\r\n     _Susceptible_, easily admitting anything additional.\r\n\r\n     _Porous_, full of holes, or interstices.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there different sorts of this Stone?\r\n\r\nMarbles are of many different kinds, usually named either from their\r\ncolor or country; some of one simple color, as white, or black; others\r\nstreaked or variegated with different colors. They are classified as\r\nancient and modern: the ancient are those found in quarries now lost\r\nor inaccessible to us, and of which there are only some wrought pieces\r\nremaining;--the modern, those from quarries still open, and out of\r\nwhich blocks of marble continue to be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what countries is Marble found?\r\n\r\nThe United States, Great Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,\r\nand many other countries, produce marbles of different colors and\r\nqualities; some more beautiful, valuable, and more highly esteemed\r\nthan others, as those of Egypt, Italy, &c. Those, also, of different\r\nplaces in the same country frequently differ from each other in\r\nquality and appearance Of the European marbles, that of Italy is the\r\nmost valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind appears to have been held in the greatest esteem by the\r\nancients?\r\n\r\nA beautiful white marble, called the Parian; of which the Grecian\r\nstatues were mostly made. By some, it is supposed to have taken its\r\nname from the Isle of Paros, in the Mediterranean; but by others from\r\nParius, a famous statuary, who made it celebrated by cutting in it a\r\nstatue of Venus. Parian marble is often mentioned by ancient authors.\r\n\r\n     _Statues_, figures of men, animals, &c., cut in stone or\r\n     marble.\r\n\r\n     _Statuary_, one who makes statues.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Venus?\r\n\r\nThe goddess of love and beauty, who was an object of adoration in the\r\nidolatrous ages, when men ignorantly knelt down and worshipped stocks\r\nand stones, which their own hands had fashioned after the likeness of\r\nthings on the earth, or imaginary creations of their fancy;--or,\r\nagain, the sun, moon, and stars, instead of the one and only true God.\r\nIn those times, every nation had its peculiar deities, to whom were\r\npaid divine rites and honors, and to whose names costly temples were\r\ndedicated: these deities were divided into two classes, superior and\r\ninferior. Venus was one of the Grecian goddesses, supposed by them to\r\nhave sprung from the froth of the sea. Kings and celebrated warriors,\r\nand sages too, after death, frequently received divine honors; as\r\nConfucius, the founder of the Chinese empire, who, after death, was\r\nworshipped by that people as a god. Romulus, the first king of Rome,\r\nlikewise, was thus adored by the Romans; and many similar instances of\r\nthe same species of idolatry amongst other nations might be recorded.\r\n\r\n     _Deities_, fabulous gods or goddesses.\r\n\r\n     _Idolatrous_, given to the worship of idols.\r\n\r\n     _Superior_, higher in rank.\r\n\r\n     _Inferior_, of a lower rank.\r\n\r\n     _Sage_, a wise man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nGOLD, SILVER, LEAD, TIN, PLATINA, SULPHUR, GEMS OR PRECIOUS\r\nSTONES, AS DIAMONDS, RUBIES, EMERALDS, TURQUOIS, PEARLS,\r\nMOTHER-OR-PEARLS, AND IVORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Gold?\r\n\r\nThe purest and most precious of metals: it is sometimes found in solid\r\nmasses, as in California, Peru, Hungary, &c.; in a shape resembling\r\nthe branches of plants; in thin plates covering other bodies, as in\r\nSiberia; sometimes in a crystal form. It, however, generally occurs in\r\na metallic state, and most commonly in the form of grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it called when found in a perfect metallic form?\r\n\r\nNative gold: it is, however, seldom met with perfectly pure, being\r\nfrequently alloyed with silver, copper, iron, or platina; sometimes\r\nconcealed in other minerals; from which, if sufficiently abundant, it\r\nis extracted by art.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere and in what manner is Gold generally found?\r\n\r\nAll parts of the earth afford gold; though with great difference in\r\npoint of purity and abundance. It is chiefly obtained from mines. Many\r\nrivers contain gold in their sands, especially those of California and\r\nGuinea. Gold mines are of rare occurrence in Europe, but the metal is\r\nfound in some of its rivers; among its mines, those of Upper Hungary\r\nare the most considerable. China and Japan are rich in this metal;\r\nmany parts of Asia also possess it. Australia produces quantities of\r\nthe metal. It is also found in the eastern parts and interior of\r\nAfrica, where gold dust is collected in great quantities from earth\r\ndeposited by the rivers. But it is in America that gold is found in\r\nthe greatest abundance, particularly in the State of California, and\r\nin some parts of South America, as Brazil, Peru, Chili, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Guinea_, a country of Western Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the uses of Gold?\r\n\r\nIt is used for money, jewelry, plate, &c. It is also employed in\r\nvarious ways in the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the character of Gold?\r\n\r\nGold is so ductile and malleable, that an ounce of it may be drawn\r\ninto a thread of 73 leagues in length; or beaten into 160 leaves of 9\r\ninches square, and thin enough to be carried away by the slightest\r\nwind. It readily assumes any form that human art can bestow upon it:\r\nits color is unalterable, and the beautiful polish of which it is\r\nsusceptible, renders it the best of all metals for ornamental\r\npurposes. It is indestructible by air, water, or fire. Gold is the\r\nheaviest of all metals, except platina; it is neither very elastic,\r\nnor very hard.\r\n\r\n     _League_, a measure of length containing three miles.\r\n\r\n     _Indestructible_, incapable of being destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not the use of Gold quite ancient?\r\n\r\nYes; it appears to have been very early known to the inhabitants of\r\nthe world. In the 13th Chapter of Genesis, Abram is spoken of as very\r\nrich in silver and gold; and in the 2d Chapter of the same book, the\r\n"land of Hevilath" (now in the eastern part of Arabia Felix,) is\r\npointed out as having gold. Arabia was famed for the fineness and\r\nquality of its gold. In the time of Solomon, the gold of Ophir seems\r\nto have been much esteemed, as it is recorded that the gold used in\r\nthe building of the Temple was brought from that place by the\r\nmerchant-vessels of Hiram, King of Tyre. Ophir is supposed to have\r\nbeen situated somewhere in the East Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Silver?\r\n\r\nA beautiful white shining metal, next to gold in value, and, like that\r\nprecious substance, of great antiquity. It is found in Sweden, Norway,\r\nand the polar latitudes: when it occurs in hot climates, it is\r\ngenerally amidst mountains, covered with perpetual snow.\r\n\r\n     _Latitude_, breadth, width; in Geography, the distance of a\r\n     place in degrees, north or south, from the Equator.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere are the richest Silver Mines found?\r\n\r\nIn South America, especially among the Andes; the mines of Mexico, and\r\nthose of Nevada, also, are rich in this metal. The richest and most\r\nimportant silver mines in Europe are those of K\xc3\xb6nigsberg, in Norway,\r\nand of Andalusia, in Spain. With the exception of gold, silver is the\r\nmost ductile of all metals: a single grain may be extended into a\r\nplate 126 inches long, and half an inch broad. It is capable of still\r\nfurther extension, but its tenacity is inferior even to that of iron\r\nor copper. A silver wire one-tenth of an inch thick will scarcely bear\r\na weight of 290 pounds, whilst a gold wire of the same thickness will\r\nsupport nearly double that weight. Like some other metals, it is\r\nunalterable by air or moisture, but by an intense heat may be\r\nvolatilized, being sometimes found in the soot of chimneys where large\r\nquantities are melted.\r\n\r\n     _Volatilized_, made to fly off by evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what state is Silver usually found?\r\n\r\nIt is rarely found in a state of purity, being generally mixed with\r\nother metals, as gold, lead, &c. Masses of native silver are of no\r\ndeterminate form; being found sometimes in small branches, sometimes\r\nin threads, or very frequently in leaves, as in the Siberian mines.\r\nNative, or pure silver is chiefly found in the mines of Potosi. Silver\r\nwas used as money in commerce 1100 years before the foundation of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n     _Commerce_, trade of one nation with another, or different\r\n     persons, &c. with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Tin?\r\n\r\nA white metal, softer than any other excepting lead, more elastic, and\r\nmore sonorous. Though tin is the lightest of all metals, its ore is,\r\nwhen rich, the heaviest of all metallic ores. It has both smell and\r\ntaste; is less ductile than some harder metals, though it may be\r\nbeaten into very thin leaves; and it fuses so quickly, that it\r\nrequires a heat much less than is sufficient to make it red-hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas not the use of Tin very early known?\r\n\r\nTin was found in Britain from the earliest ages; the Phenicians traded\r\nto Cornwall for this metal 600 years before Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere are the principal Tin Mines?\r\n\r\nIn Saxony, Cornwall, and Bohemia. Tin is also found in Spain, Sumatra,\r\nSiam, Mexico, and Chili. A few specimens have been found at Goshen, in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n     _Specimens_, samples.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what state is Tin generally found?\r\n\r\nTin is sometimes found native or pure, but most frequently alloyed\r\nwith other metals: the working of tin mines is attended with much\r\ndifficulty, on account of their great depth, and the hard rocks which\r\nobstruct the progress of the miners, who are often obliged to cut\r\nthrough them. This metal is very useful in the making of domestic\r\nutensils, for coating the inside of copper and iron vessels, and for\r\nvarious other purposes.\r\n\r\n     _Obstruct_, to stand in the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Lead?\r\n\r\nA coarse, heavy metal, of a bluish grey color: it is so soft and\r\nflexible, that it is easily cut with a knife, and rolled out into\r\nsheets, &c.; it is very fusible and inelastic, but less ductile and\r\nsonorous, than any other metal. Next to gold, platina, and mercury, it\r\nis the heaviest of the metals, being eleven times heavier than an\r\nequal bulk of water. This metal loses its malleability in proportion\r\nas it is heated: as soon as it melts it calcines, and greyish-colored\r\nashes are formed on its surface; when returning from a fluid to a\r\nsolid state, it is easily divided into small grains or powder, or\r\nformed into shot, &c. Lead was in common use among the ancients.\r\n\r\n     _Flexible_, yielding, easily bent.\r\n\r\n     _Sonorous_, giving sound when struck.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Lead found?\r\n\r\nIn various countries; but it abounds principally in Great Britain and\r\nSpain; the lead mines of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa, are among the\r\nrichest in the world. Lead is a metal of great utility; it easily\r\nmelts and mixes with gold, silver, and copper; hence it is employed in\r\nrefining gold and silver, as it separates all the dirt and impurities\r\nfrom them; it is much used in building, particularly for covering\r\ngutters, pipes, &c.; lead is also used in varnishes and oil-painting,\r\nand makes the basis of the glazing of all the earthen and pottery\r\nwares.\r\n\r\n     _Refining_, cleansing, purifying.\r\n\r\n     _Varnishes_, preparations for beautifying and preserving\r\n     various articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is peculiar to the ore of Lead?\r\n\r\nThe ore of this metal is so poisonous, that the steam arising from the\r\nfurnaces in which it is smelted infects the grass of all the\r\nneighboring places, and kills the animals which feed on it: culinary\r\nvessels lined with a mixture of tin and lead, are apt to convey\r\npernicious qualities to the food prepared in them. There are various\r\npreparations of lead, serving for different purposes.\r\n\r\n     _Infects_, corrupts.\r\n\r\n     _Culinary_, adapted to the purposes of cooking.\r\n\r\n     _Pernicious_, hurtful, dangerous.\r\n\r\n     _Ore_, the mineral soil, earth, or stone dug out of the\r\n     mines, which contains the metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Black Lead?\r\n\r\nIt is a kind of mineral, of a deep shining black or bluish color, soft\r\nand unctuous to the touch; it is insoluble in acids, and infusible by\r\nfire. Black lead has been found in many parts of the world, in a state\r\nof greater or less purity, but it is the English black lead which is\r\nthe most esteemed.\r\n\r\n     _Insoluble_, incapable of dissolving.\r\n\r\n     _Infusible_, not capable of being melted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Black Lead a proper term for this mineral?\r\n\r\nNo; because, in reality, there is not a particle of lead in it. On the\r\nspot where it is procured, it is called by two or three different\r\nnames, but the most usual is Plumbago.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is the best Black Lead found?\r\n\r\nThe best and greatest quantity is found in England, in a mine near\r\nKeswick, in Cumberland. It is much used for pencils or crayons, for\r\nwriting, drawing, &c.; for this purpose it is sawn into slips, and\r\nfitted into a groove in a strip of soft wood, as cedar, &c., over\r\nwhich another is placed and fastened with glue.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Platina?\r\n\r\nA metallic substance, more recently discovered than the metals already\r\ndescribed; and analogous to the perfect metals, especially gold,--many\r\nof whose properties it possesses.\r\n\r\n     _Analogous_, bearing a resemblance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence is its name derived?\r\n\r\nIt is the diminutive of _plata_, silver, to which it appears very\r\nsimilar; platina being a silver-colored metal, in small grains.\r\n\r\n     _Diminutive_, a word lessening the meaning of the original.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence is it obtained?\r\n\r\nMostly from Russia, and, also from South America. Its color does not\r\ntarnish by exposure to the air, and appears to be equally permanent\r\nwith that of pure gold; the metal is indestructible by fire. Platina\r\nis capable of being alloyed with all metals; is fused with difficulty,\r\nbut by great labor may be rendered malleable: it is also the heaviest\r\nmetal, being 21 times heavier than water.\r\n\r\n     _Permanent_, lasting.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there any other Metals besides those already mentioned?\r\n\r\nIn addition to the metals known and used by the ancients, the chemical\r\nscience of later ages has, by decomposing other earths, added more\r\nthan thirty to the number of metals, some of them more curious than\r\nuseful; several of these are lighter than water. All the metals\r\npossess different and distinct properties from each other. They are\r\ndivided into two classes, the malleable and the brittle metals. These\r\nlast may be again divided into two others,--namely, those which are\r\neasily, and those which are with difficulty fused.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by Metallurgy?\r\n\r\nThe art of obtaining metals from their ores, comprising the processes\r\nof assaying, refining, smelting, &c. By assaying is meant, the\r\nparticular manner of examining an ore or mixed metal, according to its\r\nnature, so as to discover not only what metals and what proportions of\r\nmetal may be obtained from it, but also what other mineral substances\r\nor earths may be contained in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do the terms Refining and Smelting signify?\r\n\r\nRefining is the art of rendering the metal free from all impurities.\r\nSmelting means the melting of a metal from its ore in a smelting\r\nfurnace, in order to separate the metallic parts from the sulphur,\r\narsenic, and the earthy and stony substances with which they may be\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Sulphur?\r\n\r\nAn inflammable, fossil substance, of a dry, solid, friable nature,\r\nmelting with a small proportion of heat;--when fired in the open air,\r\nburning almost entirely away with a blue flame and noxious vapor. It\r\nis abundantly diffused in many places, especially where metallic\r\nminerals are found; but more particularly in those districts where\r\nsubterranean fires and volcanoes exist. It is also found combined with\r\nmany different substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the nature of Sulphur, and the places where it is mostly\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nSulphur almost pure, called native or virgin sulphur, is found in\r\nvolcanoes and grottoes, in the form of transparent crystals; but the\r\ngreatest quantity which exists naturally is combined with metals in\r\nores. Sulphur is both fusible and volatile,--which qualities enable us\r\nto procure it from those minerals by the process of sublimation: it\r\nunites easily, in different degrees, with all metallic matters,\r\nexcepting gold, platina, and zinc.\r\n\r\n     _Sublimation_, the act of bringing a solid substance into\r\n     the state of vapor by heat, and condensing it again by cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre not its uses very extensive?\r\n\r\nYes, both in the arts and in chemistry: it is well known to be a\r\nprincipal ingredient in the preparation of gunpowder and fire-works;\r\nit is also used for whitening wool, straw, silk, &c.; many other\r\nmatters exposed to the vapors of sulphur when burning, quickly lose\r\ntheir color, which no other substance had been able to destroy.\r\nSulphur is also frequently found in mineral waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence are the greatest quantities of Sulphur brought?\r\n\r\nThe largest quantities are brought from Saxony, in irregular masses,\r\nwhich are afterwards melted and cast into small rolls. There are about\r\nfour species of sulphur; namely, the yellow native sulphur, which in\r\nits purest state is clear, and of a pale straw color, found in the\r\ngold mines of Peru; in Hungary, and some other places: the green\r\nnative sulphur, which is harder than the other, is found in small\r\ncrust-like masses; this sort is chiefly confined to Mount Vesuvius:\r\nand the grey native sulphur, common in Iceland and many other places.\r\nNative sulphur is also found at the coal mines, near Richmond,\r\nVirginia; in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and other parts of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is the most rare and beautiful of all the kinds?\r\n\r\nThe red native sulphur; it is mostly of a fine glowing red, very\r\nbright and transparent; it is found, like the first-mentioned sort, in\r\nthe gold mines of Peru. Common sulphur, such as is used in trade and\r\nthe arts, is of a pale yellow color; and possesses a peculiar and\r\ndisagreeable smell, particularly when heated or rubbed. This is mostly\r\nextracted from the metallic sulphurets, and is commonly called\r\nbrimstone. It is the sort employed in making matches.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there not another substance also employed in the manufacture of\r\nmatches?\r\n\r\nYes: Phosphorus, a peculiar substance, chiefly of animal origin. It is\r\nmostly procured by the decomposition of the phosphoric acid which is\r\nfound in bones. It was accidentally discovered at Hamburgh, in 1669,\r\nby an alchemist named Brandt.\r\n\r\n     _Alchemist_, one skilled in Alchemy.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: See Chapter XVIII., article Chemistry.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the nature of Phosphorus?\r\n\r\nIt is a solid, inflammable substance, which burns when in contact with\r\natmospheric air. It is used in various chemical experiments, and for\r\nmaking matches; for various kinds of fire-works, &c. It will combine\r\nwith all metals except gold and zinc; and also with some earths. Some\r\nanimals, as the glow-worm, possess very peculiar phosphorescent\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n     _Phosphorescent_, having a phosphoric property, emitting\r\n     peculiar light like phosphorus.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Arsenic?\r\n\r\nA heavy metallic substance, very volatile, and highly inflammable; so\r\ncaustic or corrosive to animals, as to become a violent poison in all\r\nits states. In its metallic state it is used in several of the arts:\r\nit is employed in the manufacture of factitious metals: it is of use\r\nto the dyer in forming some of his colors; and for that purpose is\r\ngenerally combined with potassa. It is used in the making of small\r\nshot, and also in the manufacture of glass, to which it gives\r\ntransparency; in whitening copper; in calico printing; in the\r\npreparation of colors for the painter; and in the working of platina,\r\nand some other metals, to render them more easily fusible.\r\n\r\n     _Caustic_, dry, burning.\r\n\r\n     _Corrosive_, apt to corrode, to eat away, to penetrate.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the white powdered arsenic prepared?\r\n\r\nBy submitting the ore to a strong heat in a peculiar kind of furnace;\r\nthis produces a dark grey powder, which is again heated in close iron\r\nvessels; this separates it from its impurities, and the arsenic is\r\nobtained in thick, solid masses; these, by exposure to the air, fall\r\ninto a fine, white powder.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what is the word Arsenic derived?\r\n\r\nFrom a Greek word, signifying _masculine_--powerful (as a poison).\r\nArsenic is dug out of mines in Saxony, near Goslar; in Bohemia; in\r\nEngland, in the Mendip Hills, in great quantities. It has so strong a\r\ncorrosive quality as sometimes to burn the hands and feet of the\r\nminers; it is a deadly poison for all known animals. This poisonous\r\nmineral is not found native in its perfect form, being generally\r\nunited with metallic ores.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by Gems?\r\n\r\nThe word gem is used as a common name for all precious stones or\r\njewels; they consist of the siliceous earths; and are much valued for\r\ntheir lustre, transparency, color, hardness, and rarity. There are\r\nmany different kinds of precious stones, each distinguished by its\r\npeculiar character.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow are they divided?\r\n\r\nInto the pellucid gems, which are of great lustre, and extremely hard,\r\nas the diamond; the semi-pellucid, those which are not so transparent,\r\nbut yet of great beauty; those of one color, as the emerald or\r\nturquois; and those variegated or veined with different colors. Gems\r\nare sometimes found of regular shapes, with a natural polish, near the\r\nbeds of rivers after great rains; these are of the pebble kind.\r\nSometimes they are found of irregular shapes, with a rough coat, in\r\nmines and the clefts of rocks. Pearls, though not stones, are also\r\nranked among the number of gems.\r\n\r\n     _Pellucid_, clear as a drop of water.\r\n\r\n     _Semi-pellucid_, half pellucid.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the Diamond.\r\n\r\nThe diamond is a precious stone, the first in rank of all the gems,\r\nand valued for its beautiful lustre; it is the hardest of all stones,\r\nas well as the most valuable. The most esteemed are colorless. A\r\ndiamond in its natural state as it comes out of the mine, and before\r\nit is cut, is called rough, because it has no brilliancy, but is\r\ncovered with an earthy crust. The diamond is the Adamant of the\r\nancients; hence the expression "hard as adamant," from its being the\r\nhardest substance in nature. The cutting of diamonds is a work of\r\nlabor, and requires great skill; the polishing is performed by a mill\r\nof simple construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere are they mostly found?\r\n\r\nIn yellow ochreous earths; in mines; and likewise in torrents, which\r\nhave torn them from their beds. In former times, all the diamonds that\r\nwere known were brought from the famous mines of Golconda, in\r\nHindostan; the islands of Molucca and Borneo have also produced many\r\nvaluable stones. The diamond mines of Golconda are now so exhausted,\r\nthat they are not thought worth the expense of working; these gems are\r\nnow brought chiefly from Brazil, in South America.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by Ochreous?\r\n\r\nConsisting of ochre, a kind of earth with a rough and dusty surface,\r\ncomposed of fine, soft, clayey particles, which readily separate in\r\nwater. There are various colored ochres, as red, yellow, blue, green,\r\n&c.; they are very useful in many of the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat term is used to denote the quality of the Diamond?\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the value of diamonds, we distinguish them as "diamonds\r\nof the first water," meaning those which possess the greatest\r\nperfection and purity, which ought to be that of the clearest drop of\r\nwater: when they fall short of this perfection, they are said to be\r\n"of the second or third water," and so on till the stone may be\r\nproperly called a colored one.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Ruby?\r\n\r\nA beautiful gem of a red color; in its perfect state it is of great\r\nvalue. The ruby is often found perfectly pure and free from all spots\r\nor blemishes; but its value is much more frequently lessened by them,\r\nespecially in the larger stones. It is very hard, being second only to\r\nthe diamond in this respect; and is often naturally so bright and pure\r\non the surface as to need no polishing; it is often worn in rings,\r\n&c., in its rough or native state. The color of rubies varies from the\r\ndeepest to the palest red, all having more or less of a purplish\r\ntinge, which is more plainly perceived in the deeper colored specimens\r\nthan in the paler ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere are Rubies found?\r\n\r\nThey are mostly found in gold mines. We have the true rubies only from\r\nthe East. The Isle of Ceylon has long been celebrated for these gems;\r\nthey are found in a river which descends from the mountains; they are\r\nbrighter and more beautiful than those obtained in other parts, but\r\nare very rare. Some crystals are frequently found tinged with the true\r\ncolor of the ruby, but these want its lustre and hardness.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the Emerald.\r\n\r\nIt is a precious stone of a beautiful transparent green color, and,\r\nwhen in a state of perfection, nearly equal to the ruby in hardness.\r\nThe finest and best are found in America, especially among the\r\nmountains of Peru; they are also obtained from a few places in the\r\nEast. These gems are often counterfeited, as are most of the precious\r\nstones, there being even false diamonds; the genuine may be known by\r\ntheir extreme hardness and brilliancy.\r\n\r\n     _Counterfeited_, imitated with a view to defraud.\r\n\r\n     _Genuine_, true, real.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Turquois?\r\n\r\nA beautiful blue stone; it is one of the softest of the gems, and some\r\nvarieties are often used for seals, as they admit of being engraved\r\nupon. The turquois is easily imitated, and that often so perfectly as\r\nto render it very difficult to distinguish the counterfeit from the\r\ntrue gem.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what countries are they found?\r\n\r\nThe Oriental Turquois comes from Persia, the Indies, and some parts of\r\nTurkey; the turquois is also found in various parts of Europe, as\r\nGermany, Spain, and France.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Engraving?\r\n\r\nThe art of cutting metals or precious stones, and representing thereon\r\nfigures, letters, and devices; the term is, however, more particularly\r\napplied to the art of producing figures or designs on metal, &c., for\r\nthe purpose of being subsequently printed on paper. The ancients are\r\nwell known to have excelled in engraving on precious stones; many\r\nspecimens have been preserved, which surpass anything of the kind\r\nproduced by the moderns. This art is frequently alluded to in the\r\nBible. Engraving on wood, according to some authors, was introduced\r\ninto Europe from China by Venetian merchants; it is certain the art\r\nwas practised in eastern and northern Italy as early as the thirteenth\r\ncentury. The invention of copper-plate engraving has been ascribed to\r\na goldsmith of Florence, about the year 1460.\r\n\r\n     _Device_, that which is formed by design.\r\n\r\n     _Design_, a representation of a thing by an outline; a\r\n     sketch.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe Wood Engraving.\r\n\r\nThe subject is drawn on a block of box or pear-tree wood with a\r\nblack-lead pencil, or with a pen and Indian ink; the wood is then cut\r\naway, so as to leave the lines which have been drawn, as raised parts.\r\nThe ink is next applied, and by pressing damp paper upon the block,\r\nthe impressions are obtained. Albert Durer, a celebrated painter of\r\nGermany, brought the art of engraving on wood and metal, and taking\r\noff impressions on paper, &c., to great perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is engraving on copper, steel, &c., performed?\r\n\r\nThis sort of engraving is performed with a sharp-pointed instrument\r\ncalled a _graver_, by means of which figures, landscapes, &c., are\r\ntraced upon a flat surface of the metal: the lines are then filled\r\nwith ink or a similar composition, and the paper pressed on the plate.\r\nWhen taken off, an exact copy of the plate is impressed upon its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCHINEAL INSECTS AND PLANTS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Lithography?\r\n\r\nA species of engraving on stone, from which impressions can be taken\r\nmuch more expeditiously and economically than from metal. The process\r\ndepends upon the following principles:--First, the facility with which\r\ncalcareous stones imbibe water; second, the power of oily substances\r\nto repel water. When drawings are executed upon the stone with crayons\r\ncomposed of oily materials, and the surface of the stone is washed\r\nover with water, the moisture is imbibed by the stone, but repelled\r\nfrom the engraving; and when the ink, which also contains oily\r\nsubstances, is applied, it adheres only to the drawing, and not to the\r\nother portions of the stone. The block is then passed through a press,\r\nand the impressions are taken off; as many as 70,000 perfect copies\r\nhave been obtained from a single stone.\r\n\r\n     _Expeditiously_, with celerity or dispatch.\r\n\r\n     _Economically_, with economy; with frugality.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou describe Pearls as being ranked among the number of Gems, although\r\nthey are not Stones; what kind of substance are they?\r\n\r\nPearls are excrescences found in the shells of a large species of\r\noyster, which are supposed to be produced by a disease of the fish.\r\nThe best pearls are generally taken from the most fleshy part of the\r\noyster, near the hinge of the shell, but inferior kinds are found in\r\nall parts of the fish, and adhering to the shells. Pearls, from many\r\nallusions made to them in the Old Testament, were not only known to\r\nthe ancients, but were regarded by them as costly and precious gems.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do they get the Oysters which contain them?\r\n\r\nBy diving under water and picking the oysters from the large beds at\r\nthe bottom of the sea; or the rocks to which they adhere. The divers\r\ncast all the oysters they take into their boats, and carry them\r\nashore, where they deposit them in heaps; they are then left till they\r\nbecome putrid, this being necessary in order to remove the pearls\r\neasily from the rough matter by which they are surrounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat sea produces the best and greatest number of Pearls?\r\n\r\nThe finest and greatest quantities are obtained off the coast of\r\nCeylon; the pearl oyster is also found in the seas of the East Indies;\r\nin those of America, and in some parts of the European seas; but these\r\nlast are much inferior. The Oriental pearls are the finest on account\r\nof their size, color, and beauty, being of a silvery white; while the\r\nOccidental pearls are smaller, and frequently tinged with a yellow or\r\nblackish hue.\r\n\r\n     _Tinged_, slightly colored.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes not the Pearl Oyster produce a substance called Mother-of-Pearl?\r\n\r\nNo; the beautiful substance so much used for inlaying boxes, and for\r\nornamental knife-handles, &c., is produced from the shell, not of the\r\npearl oyster, but of another sea-fish of the oyster kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Inlaying?\r\n\r\nThe art of ornamenting a plain surface of wood, or other material,\r\nwith thin slices or leaves of a finer wood, of a different kind; as\r\nmahogany inlaid with ebony, &c., or with ivory, and other substances.\r\nThere are two kinds of inlaying; one, of the more ordinary sort, which\r\nconsists only of compartments of different kinds of wood, inlaid with\r\none another; the other, requiring greater skill, represents flowers,\r\nbirds, and other figures. The thin plates of wood or other substance,\r\nbeing sawed into slips, and cut into the required forms, are carefully\r\njoined, and afterwards strongly glued down on the block of wood, &c.,\r\nintended to be thus ornamented.\r\n\r\n     _Compartment_, a division, a separate part.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Ebony?\r\n\r\nA hard, black-colored wood, growing in the countries of the Levant,\r\n&c.; there are, however, several black woods of different kinds which\r\nare also called ebony.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Ivory?\r\n\r\nThe tooth or tusk of the Elephant, which grows on each side of his\r\ntrunk; it is somewhat like a horn in shape. Ivory is much esteemed for\r\nits beautiful white color, polish, and fine grain when wrought. It has\r\nbeen used from the remotest ages of antiquity; in the Scriptures we\r\nread of Solomon\'s ivory throne, and also of "vessels of ivory," and\r\n"beds of ivory:" by which it appears to have been a chief article of\r\nluxury, as well as of trade.\r\n\r\n     _Remotest_, most distant.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what countries is the Elephant an inhabitant?\r\n\r\nOf many parts of Asia and Africa. The elephant is the largest\r\nquadruped now in existence; it is extremely sagacious, docile and\r\nfriendly: in the countries where they live they are trained to useful\r\nlabor, and by their great strength are enabled to perform tasks which\r\na man or horse could not accomplish: among the native princes they\r\nwere, and even still are, used in war: with them the inhabitants are\r\nable to hunt and destroy the lion, tiger, and other beasts of prey.\r\nWith their long trunk, or proboscis, they can perform almost\r\neverything which man can with his hands.\r\n\r\n     _Quadruped_, an animal with four feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nSTARCH, ARROW-ROOT, TAPIOCA, ISINGLASS, CAVIARE, THE VINE, WINE,\r\nGIN, RUM, BRANDY, VINEGAR, INDIGO, GAMBOGE, LOGWOOD, TAR, PITCH,\r\nCAMPHOR, MUSK, MYRRH, FRANKINCENSE, AND TURPENTINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Starch?\r\n\r\nA white, powdery sediment procured from the bottom of vessels in which\r\nflour or meal has been steeped in water. Pure starch is of a fine\r\nwhite color, without taste or smell; it will not dissolve in cold\r\nwater, but with warm forms a jelly, in which form it is generally\r\nused; it is made by crushing, soaking, and fermenting the grains of\r\nthe cereals, and then washing in pure water; the water is then\r\nevaporated, leaving behind the starch.\r\n\r\n     _Sediment_, matter subsided to the bottom of liquors.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what is Starch used?\r\n\r\nTo stiffen linen after washing; to make hair powder; and for other\r\npurposes in the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what vegetables is Starch obtained?\r\n\r\nAll farinaceous vegetable substances afford it, as the potato,\r\nhorse-chestnut, &c. Starch being the nutritive part of the vegetable,\r\nforms an excellent food for invalids, and constitutes the principal\r\npart of arrow-root, tapioca, &c.; the different flavor of these\r\nsubstances being derived from the mixture of a small portion of\r\nforeign matter peculiar to the plants which yield them. Starch is\r\nprocured from potatoes by crushing them to powder, and then proceeding\r\nas in the manufacture of wheat starch.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Arrow-root?\r\n\r\nThe starch obtained from the root of an American plant by\r\npulverization. It is often adulterated with potato starch, and the\r\nlatter is even sold instead of it, for the two kinds resemble each\r\nother so closely that they can hardly be distinguished.\r\n\r\n     _Pulverization_, the act of reducing to powder.\r\n\r\n     _Adulterated_, corrupted by foreign mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Tapioca?\r\n\r\nTapioca is another kind of starch, obtained from the root of the\r\nmanioc plant, which is cultivated in most hot climates, in Asia,\r\nAfrica, and America. A flour is also prepared from it, which is used\r\nfor making bread. It is particularly cultivated in the tropical parts\r\nof America, and in the West India islands, where it forms a very\r\nimportant article of food for the Negro population.\r\n\r\n     _Negro_, a name given to the black inhabitants of Africa and\r\n     their descendants.\r\n\r\n     _Population_, inhabitants of a place or country.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Isinglass?\r\n\r\nOne of the purest and finest of _animal_ glues. It is the produce of\r\nseveral kinds of fish, but especially of the sturgeon, which inhabits\r\nthe seas of Northern Europe and America.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what part of the fish is it prepared?\r\n\r\nFrom the air-bladder, and certain parts of the entrails; these are\r\ntaken out while fresh, cut open, washed, and exposed to the air a\r\nshort time to stiffen; the outside skin is then taken off, and the\r\nremaining part formed into rolls, fastened together with pegs, and\r\nhung up to dry. The isinglass is then separated into threads of\r\ndifferent sizes, or formed into flakes. Immense quantities are\r\nannually prepared in this manner in Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are its uses?\r\n\r\nDissolving readily in water or milk, it yields a mild nutriment for\r\nthe sick, and enters into the composition of many delicacies for the\r\ntable, such as jellies, &c. It is mixed with gum to give lustre to\r\nsilk and satin; it is also used in making court plaster, and for\r\nclarifying various liquors. Gelatine, now much used on account of its\r\nbeing less expensive, is a similar preparation, but of an inferior\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat else does the Sturgeon supply?\r\n\r\nIts roe furnishes the delicacy called Caviare, which is in fact merely\r\nthat part of the fish separated from the membranes and washed in\r\nvinegar and white wine, and dried in the air. It is then well salted,\r\nand packed up in barrels ready for sale. This is the method of\r\npreparing it in Russia, where large quantities of it are consumed. It\r\nis largely exported to Italy, where it is highly esteemed. It is\r\nunwholesome, and at present the demand for it, except in Russia and\r\nItaly, is very limited. The best is dry and of a brown color, and is\r\neaten with lemon juice on bread.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what other uses is the fruit of the Vine applied besides drying it\r\nfor raisins, as described in the sixth chapter?\r\n\r\nThe well-known plant, called the Vine, has been an object of culture\r\nfrom the earliest ages of the world, for the sake of the fermented\r\nliquor obtained from its fruit; soon after the flood, Noe, who appears\r\nto have been the first "husbandman," is mentioned as having "planted a\r\nvineyard," and drank of the juice of the grape; in all those countries\r\nwhere it flourishes, it is inseparably connected with their religious\r\nrites, and wine, like corn, formed one of the principal articles which\r\nthey offered on their altars to the gods whom they worshipped.\r\n\r\n     _Husbandman_, one who cultivates the fruits of the earth.\r\n\r\n     _Altar_, the place where sacrifices were anciently offered\r\n     to some deity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat countries produce the best Wines?\r\n\r\nThe wines of France are generally admitted to be the finest; the\r\nprincipal ones are Champagne, Burgundy, and Claret. Of each of these,\r\nthere are several varieties, celebrated for their peculiar flavor;\r\nthey are generally named after the places where they are made. Spain,\r\nPortugal, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Sicily, Greece, and California,\r\nalso produce their various sorts of wine, each esteemed in its kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay Wine be extracted from other vegetable bodies?\r\n\r\nThe word is appropriated in a more particular manner to the fermented\r\njuice of the grape; but nearly all vegetable productions may be made\r\nto afford wine. That produced from Apples is called Cider; that from\r\nPears, Perry. A kind of wine, called Mead, is prepared from honey and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n     _Appropriated_, applied to.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Honey?\r\n\r\nA sweet vegetable juice, collected from the flowers of various plants\r\nby the bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Honey was reckoned by the ancients the best in the world?\r\n\r\nThe honey of Hybla, on the east coast of Sicily, and of Hymettus, a\r\nmountain of Greece, near Athens.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat other fluid is drawn from Wine?\r\n\r\nSpirits; by this term is understood, a volatile fluid called spirits\r\nof wine, or alcohol, obtained by distillation from wine, beer, and all\r\nfermented liquors. It is colorless, and of a strong penetrating taste\r\nand smell. It is of great use in chemistry; in dyeing to prepare the\r\nstuff for receiving colors; and in many of the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the vessel called which is used in Distilling?\r\n\r\nA Still. It is a vessel so formed as to collect the vapor, which is\r\nthe spirit, or alcohol, separated from the liquid from which it is\r\ndrawn. This liquid product is itself returned to the still; and the\r\nsame process is several times repeated, till the alcohol or spirit is\r\nsufficiently strong and pure. There are three principal spirits used\r\nin this country, as gin, rum, and brandy.\r\n\r\n     _Product_, thing produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Gin?\r\n\r\nA spirit procured from raw barley, oats, and malt, mixed together in\r\ncertain proportions: there are several varieties of this spirit, all\r\nobtained from grain. The peculiar flavor of gin is given by infusing a\r\nfew hops and some of the berries of the juniper fir.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Malt?\r\n\r\nMalt is barley prepared by being steeped in water and fermented, and\r\nthen dried in a kiln. It is used for making beer, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what are Hops the produce?\r\n\r\nOf a graceful climbing plant, the blossoms of which are used in making\r\nbeer, to preserve it and improve its flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Rum?\r\n\r\nA spirit obtained from molasses, the fluid which drains from sugar\r\nwhile it is crystallizing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Brandy?\r\n\r\nA spirit distilled from any wine; but the best is procured from weak\r\nFrench wines, which are unfit for exportation. Brandy, from whatever\r\nwine it has been obtained, is at first colorless; different methods\r\nare employed to give it the color by which it is distinguished.\r\n\r\n     _Exportation_, the act of sending articles from one country\r\n     to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Vinegar?\r\n\r\nAn agreeable, acid, penetrating liquor, prepared from wine, beer, &c.\r\nTo make vinegar, the wine or beer is made to undergo a second\r\nfermentation, called the _acid_ or _acetous_ fermentation; the first\r\nwhich the vegetable juice had to undergo, in order to convert it into\r\nwine or beer, being called the _vinous_ fermentation. Vinegar is of\r\ngreat use in cookery and medicine; the word is derived from the French\r\nfor wine, _vin_, and _aigre_, sour. The ancients had several kinds of\r\nvinegar, which they used as drinks; but it is most likely that these\r\nvinegars were different from that so called among us, and were more\r\nprobably a kind of wine.\r\n\r\n     _Acetous_, sour.\r\n\r\n     _Vinous_, wine-like.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat materials are used for the dyeing and coloring of our\r\nmanufactures?\r\n\r\nThere are many mineral and vegetable earths which furnish mankind with\r\ndifferent colors for beautifying their various manufactures, and\r\nassisting them in the arts, &c. Some species of insects also come to\r\ntheir aid, as for instance, the cochineals; these insects are killed\r\nby the application of heat, and thus form the drug used for giving red\r\ncolors, especially crimson and scarlet, and for making carmine. The\r\nbeautiful and permanent blue called Indigo, is the produce of a small\r\nshrub, two or three feet in height.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what part is the Dye obtained?\r\n\r\nFrom the leaves; the color is produced by soaking them some hours in\r\nwater, in large vessels constructed for the purpose; the sediment of\r\nthe blue liquor drawn from them is afterwards dried and sold in the\r\nform of small grains For the painter, they are mixed with oil, or\r\ndiluted and made up into small cakes with gum water.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what countries is Indigo cultivated?\r\n\r\nIt is native in both Indies, and in South America, where its\r\ncultivation affords employment to many of the inhabitants. It also\r\ngrows wild in parts of Palestine, and is much cultivated both in Syria\r\nand Egypt. It once formed one of the staples of the Southern States,\r\nbut has in a great measure given way to the cultivation of cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\nHas Indigo been long known?\r\n\r\nThe culture and preparation of indigo were known to the Oriental\r\nnations long before it was introduced into Europe. The inhabitants of\r\nancient Britain painted their bodies with the blue dye which they\r\nobtained from woad, a plant which grows wild in France and along the\r\nshores of the Baltic, and which greatly resembles indigo in all its\r\nproperties, except its brilliancy of color.\r\n\r\n     _Brilliancy_, brightness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Gamboge?\r\n\r\nThe concrete resinous juice of a species of gum-tree, growing in\r\nCambodia, and other parts of the Indies. It is brought over in large\r\ncakes or rolls of a yellowish brown color outside, and inside of a\r\ndeep yellow or orange, which changes to a pale bright yellow on being\r\nmoistened.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the uses of Gamboge?\r\n\r\nDissolved in water, it forms a beautiful and useful color for the\r\npainter. It is also used in medicine. Gamboge is soluble in either\r\nwater or spirits of wine. Mixed with a blue color, it forms green, in\r\nvarious shades according to the different proportions of the\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Logwood?\r\n\r\nThe wood of a tree which grows in parts of America and the West\r\nIndies. It is imported in great quantities, and employed in dyeing\r\npurple and the finest blacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Tar?\r\n\r\nA coarse, resinous liquor issuing from the wood and bark of pine or\r\nfir-trees; it is in fact the oily juices of the sap thickened and\r\ncolored by the heat of the sun or by age; it is extracted for use by\r\nburning the wood of the trees under a heavy covering of turf or earth;\r\nthe tar exudes during the slow combustion, and is collected into a\r\ncavity dug in the ground for the purpose. Tar is exported in great\r\nquantities from Norway, Sweden, and our Southern States.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are its uses?\r\n\r\nIt is applied to the sides of ships and boats and their rigging, to\r\npreserve them from the effects of the weather; it is used instead of\r\npaint for palings, &c.; and sometimes also in medicine. A kind, called\r\n_mineral_ tar, is also drawn from coal by the process of distillation.\r\nMineral tar is also found native in some parts of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Pitch?\r\n\r\nA kind of juice or gum, likewise drawn from unctuous woods, chiefly\r\nthose of the pine and fir; it is used for nearly the same purposes as\r\ntar in shipping, medicine, and various other arts. Pitch is properly a\r\njuice of the wild pine, or pitch tree; it is of a glossy black color,\r\ndry brittle, and less bitter and pungent than the liquid tar.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Camphor?\r\n\r\nA vegetable substance, chiefly procured from a kind of laurel, (Laurus\r\nCamphora,) growing in Borneo, Japan, and many East Indian islands; it\r\nis also produced from other plants and shrubs, though in very small\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow, and from what part of the tree is it taken?\r\n\r\nAll parts of the tree are impregnated with camphor; but it is\r\nprincipally extracted from the roots and trunk, by distillation; it is\r\nwhite, and of a crystal form: its odor is extremely fragrant. In this\r\nstate it is called _rough_ camphor, and is thus exported. The Greeks\r\nand Romans do not appear to have been acquainted with this valuable\r\ndrug; and we are indebted to the Arabians for a knowledge of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the properties and uses of Camphor?\r\n\r\nIt is a firm, dry, crystal matter, with a hot, sharp, aromatic taste.\r\nIt is highly odorous, and so inflammable as to burn and preserve its\r\nflame in water; it totally vanishes or evaporates in the open air, and\r\nin Spirits of Wine it entirely dissolves. Camphor has various uses--as\r\nin fire-works, &c.; it is an excellent preservative of animal and\r\nvegetable bodies, as it resists worms and other insects. In the courts\r\nof Eastern princes it is burnt at night with wax. Its principal use\r\nwith us is in medicine.\r\n\r\n     _Preservative_, a preventive of decay.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Musk?\r\n\r\nA dry, friable substance of a dark color, taken from a little bag\r\nunder the belly of a small animal called the Thibet Musk, which is a\r\nnative of the Indies, Tonquin, and China. It inhabits the woods and\r\nforests, where the natives hunt it down. Musk is so strong a perfume\r\nas to be agreeable only in the smallest quantities, or when mingled\r\nwith some other scent; it is used in perfumery, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there not another Animal which produces a similar scent?\r\n\r\nYes; an animal of Arabian origin produces an odoriferous substance\r\ncalled Civet, from which it takes its name of Civet Cat; there are\r\nseveral species of this animal which produce it, but it is from the\r\nCivet Cat that it is most commonly taken. Civets are found in all the\r\nwarm parts of Asia and Africa, in Madagascar, and the East Indian\r\nIslands. It was formerly in high esteem, but is at present very little\r\nused, except to increase the power of other perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Myrrh?\r\n\r\nA kind of gum-resin, issuing from the trunk of a tree growing in\r\nArabia, Egypt, and Abyssinia; it flows either naturally, or by\r\nincision; and is sent to us in small lumps of a reddish brown or\r\nyellow color. Its smell is strong, but not disagreeable. Our myrrh is\r\nthe same drug that was used by the ancients under the above name. Its\r\nchief use now is in medicine. The ancient Egyptians employed it as an\r\ningredient in the embalming of dead bodies.\r\n\r\n     _Embalming_, preserving the bodies of the dead from decaying\r\n     or putrefying, by impregnating them with aromatics and other\r\n     substances which resist putrefaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Abyssinia?\r\n\r\nAbyssinia is a large kingdom situated in Eastern Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Frankincense?\r\n\r\nAn odoriferous, aromatic gum-resin, which distils, in the heat of\r\nsummer, from incisions made in the bark of the tree which produces it:\r\nnotwithstanding the great use of the gum, both in ancient systems of\r\nreligious worship and in modern medicine, authors have been much\r\ndivided in opinion with regard to the kind of tree from which it is\r\nobtained; it is a species of turpentine tree belonging to an order of\r\nresinous and fragrant trees and shrubs inhabiting the tropical parts\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what was it formerly used?\r\n\r\nThe ancients burnt it in their temples as a perfume, and to do honor\r\nto the divinities that were worshipped in them: it appears to have\r\nbeen applied to the same purposes by people of all religions. Myrrh\r\nand Frankincense were reckoned by the Eastern nations amongst their\r\nmost costly perfumes. We are informed by St. Matthew\'s Gospel in the\r\nNew Testament, that the wise men who came to Bethlehem to worship our\r\nSaviour at his birth, brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.\r\nMany of the primitive Christians were put to death because they would\r\nnot offer incense to idols. In the Catholic Church we still retain its\r\nuse in many ceremonies.\r\n\r\n     _Primitive_, early.\r\n\r\n     _Incense_, perfumes burnt in religious rites, or as an\r\n     offering to some deity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the appearance of Frankincense?\r\n\r\nIt is generally imported in white or yellowish pieces, or drops,\r\nwhich possess a bitter, disagreeable taste; it is very inflammable,\r\nand burns with a strong, and pleasant odor. That brought from the\r\nIndies is inferior to that from Arabia, and inclines to a reddish\r\ncolor. The common frankincense is softer, more resinous, and possesses\r\nless value than the former.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Turpentine?\r\n\r\nThe resinous juice of many trees, as the pine, larch, fir, &c.; it is,\r\nin fact, the juice that renders them evergreen, and when in an\r\nover-abundant quantity, bursts through their bark, and oozes out.\r\nCommon turpentine is that procured by incisions from the wild pine;\r\nthere are several kinds of turpentine procured from various resinous\r\ntrees; some are of use in medicine, and most of them in making\r\ndifferent kinds of varnishes, for preserving and beautifying boxes,\r\npaintings, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Ooze_, to flow gently.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there not a tree more particularly designated the Turpentine Tree?\r\n\r\nYes, the Terebinth or Turpentine Tree of Palestine and the East. It is\r\none of the most common forest trees of those regions, and is regarded\r\nwith respect and distinction similar to that awarded to the oak in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat part of it produces the Gum?\r\n\r\nThe gum, or rather the resin, distils from the trunk. It is called\r\nCyprus or Chian Turpentine, much of it being brought from the isles of\r\nCyprus and Scio, or Chios, and is procured, by incision, about the\r\nmonth of July. This turpentine, owing to its superior quality, as well\r\nas its scarcity, each tree seldom yielding over two or three pounds,\r\nis very costly.\r\n\r\n     _Incision_, a cutting.\r\n\r\n     _Costly_, expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nBRICKS, MORTAR, GRANITE, SLATE, LIMESTONE, OR CALCAREOUS ROCKS,\r\nSTEEL, EARTHS, VOLCANOES, AND EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what are Bricks composed?\r\n\r\nOf clay, dried by the heat of the sun, or burnt in kilns; their color\r\nvaries with the different degrees of heat to which they are subjected\r\nin burning. In the East, bricks were baked in the sun; the Romans used\r\nthem crude, only laying them to dry in the air for a long space of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n     _Crude_, in the rough, unbaked state, just as they were\r\n     formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long have Bricks been in use for building?\r\n\r\nBricks appear to have been in use at a very remote period of\r\nantiquity, both from the account of them in the Holy Scriptures, and\r\nfrom the remains of them which have been found; the Tower of Babel and\r\nthe walls of Babylon were built of them. They were in early use among\r\nthe Egyptians, as appears from the history of the Jews before their\r\ndeliverance by Moses. In the book of Exodus, we are told that this\r\ncaptive people were compelled to make bricks for that nation. The\r\nRomans, under their first kings, built with massive square stones; but\r\ntowards the end of the Republic they began to use brick, borrowing the\r\npractice from the Greeks; and the greatest and most durable buildings\r\nof the succeeding Emperors were composed of them, as the Pantheon, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Massive_, bulky and heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy whom was the Tower of Babel erected, and why?\r\n\r\nBy the descendants of Noe\'s three sons, Sem, Cham, and Japheth; they\r\nwere extremely numerous, and dwelt in the land of Sennaar; becoming\r\nambitious of distinguishing themselves, they set about building a\r\ntower whose summit might reach to heaven. Sennaar was the original\r\nname of the country about Babylon.\r\n\r\n     _Descendants_, those descended from a particular person or\r\n     family.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat remarkable event followed their foolish pride?\r\n\r\nThe Almighty suddenly frustrated their purpose by confusing their\r\nlanguage and causing them all to express their words by different\r\nsounds; hence arose the numbers of different languages spoken by the\r\nnations of the earth; and thus what they imagined would be a monument\r\nof glory, was made an awful memento of their pride and folly.\r\n\r\n     _Frustrated_, prevented.\r\n\r\n     _Monument_, anything by which the memory of persons or\r\n     things is preserved.\r\n\r\n     _Memento_, a hint to awaken the memory of anything; that\r\n     which reminds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat good effect did this event produce?\r\n\r\nGod, who at all times can bring good out of evil, by this means caused\r\nthe other parts of the earth to be peopled; for this visitation having\r\neffectually broken up their scheme, they emigrated in parties, and\r\ndispersed themselves over different parts of the world.\r\n\r\n     _Scheme_, plan, intention.\r\n\r\n     _Emigrated_, removed from one country to another.\r\n\r\n     _Dispersed_, separated.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere was Babylon?\r\n\r\nThis celebrated city, so often mentioned in Holy Writ, (and remarkable\r\nfor the minuteness with which its destruction was foretold by the\r\nProphets,) was the capital of the Assyrian Empire, and situated on the\r\nriver Euphrates. After the destruction of Nineve, the ancient capital\r\nof this empire, Babylon became the most famous city of the East.\r\n\r\n     _Minuteness_, particularity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by the Assyrian Empire?\r\n\r\nThe country of Assyria, in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what was this city particularly celebrated?\r\n\r\nFor its hanging gardens, palaces, temples, and walls, the latter of\r\nwhich are said to have been three hundred and fifty feet high, and so\r\nbroad that six chariots could go abreast upon them. The city was so\r\nstrongly fortified, both by nature and art, as to be thought\r\nimpregnable.\r\n\r\n     _Fortified_, defended.\r\n\r\n     _Impregnable_, incapable of being taken or destroyed by an\r\n     enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy whom was it destroyed, and when?\r\n\r\nBy Cyrus, 538 years before the birth of Christ, just fifty years after\r\nNabuchodonosor had destroyed the city of Jerusalem and its temple.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Cyrus?\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Persian Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Nabuchodonosor?\r\n\r\nThe King of Babylon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the Pantheon?\r\n\r\nA temple of a circular form which was dedicated to all the Gods, or\r\nall the Saints. That of all others the most celebrated, is the\r\nPantheon of ancient Rome, and its remains are the most perfect amongst\r\nthe wonders of that city at the present day.\r\n\r\n     _Circular_, having the form of a circle, round.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy whom was it built?\r\n\r\nBy Agrippa, the Consul of Rome, twenty-five years before Christ; it\r\nwas dedicated by him to Jupiter: the name Pantheon was given on\r\naccount of the great number of statues of the Gods ranged in niches\r\nall round it; and because it was built in a circular form to represent\r\nheaven, the residence of the Gods. It was afterwards converted into a\r\nchurch by Pope Boniface IV, and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin and\r\nall the Martyrs, under the title of "Our Lady of the Rotunda." Agrippa\r\nlikewise built the Pantheon at Athens, which was but little inferior\r\nto that of Rome. The Greek Christians afterwards converted it into a\r\nchurch, dedicating it to the Blessed Virgin; but the Turks, when they\r\nsubdued Greece, changed it into a mosque.\r\n\r\n     _Dedicated_, appropriated to a particular person, or to a\r\n     sacred use.\r\n\r\n     _Residence_, dwelling, habitation.\r\n\r\n     _Martyr_, one who is put to death for the cause of religion.\r\n\r\n     _Mosque_, a Mahommedan temple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SLATE QUARRY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is understood by a Consul?\r\n\r\nThe chief magistrate of the Roman republic or commonwealth. After the\r\nRomans had expelled their kings, they were governed by two Consuls;\r\nthese were established in the year of Rome 245. The Consuls were the\r\nhead of the senate; they commanded the armies of the republic, and\r\njudged all the differences between the citizens: they held their\r\noffice for the space of a year; at the end of which time, new ones\r\nwere elected. Consuls were even continued under the Emperors after the\r\nrepublic was destroyed; but it was then little more than an honorary\r\ntitle, and at last was totally abolished.\r\n\r\n     _Expelled_, turned out.\r\n\r\n     _Abolished_, annulled, made void.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what is the term Consul applied at the present time?\r\n\r\nTo an officer established by a commission from a king or state, to\r\nreside in foreign countries of any considerable trade, to facilitate\r\nand despatch business, protect the merchants of the state, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Commission_, a trust imposed, command, authority.\r\n\r\n     _Facilitate_, to render easy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by a Senate?\r\n\r\nAn assembly or council of senators, that is, of the principal\r\ninhabitants of a state, who have a share in the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the government of the United States?\r\n\r\nIt is one of limited and definite powers, defined by a written\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow are the legislative powers, granted to the government, vested?\r\n\r\nIn a Congress, consisting of a Senate of two Senators from each state,\r\nchosen by the legislature thereof; and a House of Representatives,\r\nconsisting of one or more members from each state, elected by the\r\npeople in equal electoral districts.\r\n\r\n     _Legislative_, giving or enacting laws\r\n\r\n\r\nHow are our laws made?\r\n\r\nBills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate, on\r\nreceiving the sanction of the President, become laws; or, if vetoed by\r\nthe President, may be passed by two-thirds of both Houses.\r\n\r\n     _Vetoed_, withheld assent to.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Jupiter?\r\n\r\nThe principal deity of the Pagan world.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is used to cement bricks firmly together?\r\n\r\nMortar; a composition of lime, sand, gravel, &c., mixed up with water;\r\nthe ancients had a kind of mortar so very hard and binding, that, even\r\nto this day, it is next to impossible to separate the parts of some of\r\ntheir buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Granite?\r\n\r\nA rock which has been formed by the union of three different minerals\r\nin a state of fusion; these, on cooling, have crystallized and become\r\ndistinct from each other in the mass. It is remarkable for the beauty\r\nof its colors, its hardness and durability. There are granites of many\r\ndifferent colors, as red or rose-colored, grey, green, variegated, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Fusion_, a melted state.\r\n\r\n     _Mass_, a body, a lump.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat form does it bear?\r\n\r\nGranite does not, generally, form one extensive mass, but remains in\r\nseparate and large fragments, rudely compacted together; besides the\r\nthree minerals of which it is composed, particles of other stones, or\r\nmetallic earths, are often accidentally mixed with it. It is called\r\ngranite from its granulous structure.\r\n\r\n     _Compacted_, joined together.\r\n\r\n     _Granulous_, consisting of small grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Granite found?\r\n\r\nGranite occurs in all the larger mountain ranges, and in isolated\r\nmasses in every country; not being a stratified rock, and being\r\nexcessively hard, it is difficult to get it out in manageable masses.\r\nIn Arabia Petr\xc3\xa6a, the whole country abounds in masses of different\r\ngranites.\r\n\r\n     _Isolated_, alone, separated, detached.\r\n\r\n     _Stratified_, consisting of strata or beds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat mode is usually employed in this country in obtaining it?\r\n\r\nBlasting, or blowing up with gunpowder; the force of which detaches\r\npieces from the rock, which are hewn roughly into forms on the spot by\r\na small pickaxe. Granite is also quarried by cutting a deep line some\r\nyards long, and placing strong iron wedges at equal distances along\r\nthis line; these wedges are struck in succession with heavy hammers,\r\ntill the mass splits down. Another method of detaching masses of rock,\r\nis by driving wooden wedges into a deep artificial or natural crack,\r\nor fissure; the wedges are then wet, and, in consequence of swelling,\r\nburst the rock asunder.\r\n\r\n     _Quarried_, from _to quarry_, a term used for the getting of\r\n     stone from a quarry, or place where stones are dug from the\r\n     earth, or detached from a large mass of rock.\r\n\r\n     _Detach_, to separate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what is this Rock used?\r\n\r\nOn account of its great hardness, it is used for large public\r\nstructures, as bridges, churches, &c. The ancient temples and other\r\nbuildings in Egypt, Asia, and Italy, were built of different colored\r\ngranites, especially the beautiful Oriental red granite.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Slate?\r\n\r\nThe common name for a bluish fossil stone, very soft when dug out of\r\nthe quarry, and easily cut or split into thin plates,--a property\r\nwhich renders it invaluable for a variety of purposes.\r\n\r\n     _Invaluable_, extremely valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what is it used?\r\n\r\nSlate has superseded the use of lead for covering roofs, even of the\r\nlargest buildings; being lighter and more durable, it is preferable to\r\ntile: it is also employed for slabs to form cisterns, shelves for\r\ndairies, and other purposes, on account of its strength, coolness, and\r\nthe ease with which it can be cleaned; the latter quality renders it\r\nalso of great value in the business of education, as a cheap\r\nsubstitute for paper. The ancients were unacquainted with the use of\r\nslate.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat other kinds of stone are used in building?\r\n\r\nLimestone, or the calcareous rocks of the geologist: of these there\r\nare many varieties. Those which are easily cut and polished are termed\r\nmarbles, and are used in sculpture and in ornamental architecture. The\r\ncoarser marbles are used for the common purposes of building.\r\n\r\n     _Calcareous_, partaking of the nature of calx or lime,--a\r\n     term employed to describe chalk, marble, and all other\r\n     combinations of lime with carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n     _Geologist_, one who studies the science of Geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what do Calcareous Earths or Stones consist?\r\n\r\nCalcareous earths, stones, or rocks consist of lime, or pure\r\ncalcareous earth, carbonic acid, and water.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Quick-Lime?\r\n\r\nLimestone deprived of its carbonic acid and water by being subjected\r\nto an intense heat in a kiln.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow are these Stones wrought?\r\n\r\nTo whatever purpose the stones are to be applied, the larger blocks\r\nobtained from the quarry must be cut into smaller and more manageable\r\npieces by sawing: the saw used is a long blade of steel, without\r\nteeth, fixed in a heavy wooden frame. These huge saws are worked by\r\none or two men who sit in boxes to shelter them from the weather;\r\nwater is caused to drip constantly into the cut, to facilitate the\r\nmotion of the saw, and keep it cool, so as to prevent it from losing\r\nits temper.\r\n\r\n     _Huge_, very large.\r\n\r\n     _Temper_, hardness; in speaking of metals it signifies the\r\n     state to which they are reduced, especially with regard to\r\n     their hardness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Steel?\r\n\r\nIron combined with a small portion of carbon; its chemical name is\r\n_Carburet of Iron_. It is not so malleable as iron in its ordinary\r\nstate; but is much harder, more elastic, and susceptible of a higher\r\npolish. Of this material are manufactured knives, swords, and all\r\nkinds of cutting instruments and edge tools, used for domestic\r\npurposes and in the arts, from the ponderous pit-saw to the finest\r\nlancet. Good steel is much more ductile than iron; and a finer wire\r\nmay be drawn from it than from any other metal. The excellence of\r\nedge-tools depends upon their temper.\r\n\r\n     _Ponderous_, heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou say that a Geologist is one who studies Geology: what is meant by\r\nthis term?\r\n\r\nA science which enables us to read, in the simple language of nature,\r\nthe changes which have taken place on the surface of the earth, in its\r\nstructure and mineral constitution. It describes the different\r\nmaterials and the strata of which the crust of the earth is composed,\r\nand investigates the causes of its physical features.\r\n\r\n     _Simple_, easily read.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Strata?\r\n\r\nLayers of rocks and other substances of which the whole earth seems to\r\nbe composed. These rocks are found lying one above another in regular\r\norder; beneath them are the _unstratified_ rocks, which seem to form\r\nthe basis or foundations upon which the others have been deposited.\r\nThe various layers seem to have been formed during progressive stages\r\nof vegetable and animal organization. These rocks and strata are\r\ndivided into five classes or formations.\r\n\r\n     _Progressive_, moving forwards.\r\n\r\n     _Organization_, formation or structure of bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nName them.\r\n\r\nThe Primitive, or lower formations, supposed to have been formed in\r\nthe chaotic state of the earth, because they have no trace of\r\norganized beings or petrifactions; they are chiefly composed of\r\nsilicious and argillaceous earths, as granite, slate, &c.--Transition\r\nrocks, supposed to have been formed during the transition of the earth\r\ninto a habitable state; they differ from the primitive, in containing\r\nthe remains of marine animals:--the Secondary rocks, containing the\r\nremains of animals and vegetables, and consequently formed after their\r\ncreation;--the Tertiary formation, composed of layers of clay, sand,\r\ngravel, and marl, and containing peculiar organic remains;--and the\r\nAlluvial formation, constituted of parts of previous rocks separated\r\nby water, &c., and deposited in beds.\r\n\r\n     _Petrifaction_, an animal or vegetable substance turned to\r\n     stone.\r\n\r\n     _Silicious_, consisting of flint.\r\n\r\n     _Transition_, change from one state to another.\r\n\r\n     _Argillaceous_, clayey, consisting of clay.\r\n\r\n     _Chaotic_, resembling chaos, confused.\r\n\r\n     _Chaos_, confusion, a mingled heap; a term used in speaking\r\n     of the world while yet without form; a Greek word,\r\n     signifying a confused mass.\r\n\r\n     _Alluvial_, deposited from water.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what is this last compounded?\r\n\r\nThe Alluvial formation is composed of sand, gravel, loam, clay, turf,\r\n&c., and contains plants, roots, moss, bones, petrified wood, and\r\nskeletons of animals. It is distinguished from the Tertiary formation\r\nchiefly by its superior position, and by extending over regions where\r\nexisting streams or other causes now in action could have produced it.\r\nSome geologists mention another formation called the Volcanic, because\r\ncomposed of minerals thrown from the crater of a volcano, such as\r\npumice stones, lava, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Crater_, the mouth or opening of a volcano.\r\n\r\n     _Petrified_, hardened into stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou mentioned Silicious and Argillaceous Earths: is not, then, the\r\nearthy covering of our globe of one common character?\r\n\r\nNo; by earth is understood a combination of many distinct bodies.\r\nChemists, by separating earths from each other, and from foreign\r\nmatters connected with them, have discovered nine or ten primitive\r\nearths; all of these, except silex, are compounds of oxygen with\r\nmetallic bases.\r\n\r\n     _Chemist_, one who understands the science of chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf which of these Simple or Primitive Earths are the solid portions of\r\nthe globe principally composed?\r\n\r\nOf flint or silex, lime or calcareous earth, and clay or argil, in\r\nvarious degrees of combination, the greatest parts of the mountains\r\nand plains, and the whole of what we commonly understand by soil,\r\nmould, earth, &c. are composed. These, however, though forming nearly\r\nall of the solid portions of the world, are constantly mixed with\r\nforeign matters, as metals, (particularly iron,) and acids, (as\r\ncarbonic acid.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the properties of Silex?\r\n\r\nSilex, or pure flint, will not dissolve in water, nor can it be melted\r\nby itself in any heat; but combined with alkalies, as soda or potash,\r\nit forms glass. It is the principal ingredient of most of the precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the chief uses of Silex?\r\n\r\nIt is the most durable article for the formation of roads; a necessary\r\ningredient in earthenware, porcelain, and cements; and the principal\r\nmaterial of glass and vitreous substances. The making of pastes or\r\nartificial gems is a branch of the art of glass-making; the basis used\r\nis a very hard and pure silex.\r\n\r\n     _Basis_, that part of any mixture which is the ground or\r\n     base; the first principle or element of a substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the properties of Lime.\r\n\r\nIt is of a white color, and possesses a hot, caustic taste. It forms\r\npeculiar salts with acids; changes vegetable blues to green; will not\r\nfuse; gives out a quantity of caloric when united with water; and\r\nabsorbs carbonic acid when exposed to air. Lime is very useful in the\r\narts and manufactures, in medicine, &c. The farmers use it as manure\r\nto fertilize land.\r\n\r\n     _Caustic_, burning, corroding: a term applied to substances\r\n     which eat away and burn any thing with which they are\r\n     brought in contact.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what state is Lime found in nature?\r\n\r\nNever native, but combined with other substances;--generally with an\r\nacid, and most plentifully with carbonic acid, as in chalk, marble,\r\n&c. It is also found in vegetables, and is the basis of animal bones;\r\nit likewise occurs in the water of the ocean, and in that of all\r\nsprings and rivers. The method of procuring _lime_, from chalk,\r\nmarble, limestone, oyster-shells, &c., has already been described in a\r\nformer chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the properties of Clay?\r\n\r\nArgil, or pure clay, also called _alumina_, from its being the basis\r\nof alum, is soft to the touch, adhesive, and emits a peculiar odor\r\nwhen moistened;--forms a paste with water, and hardens in the fire.\r\nIts uses are so various and important, that it would have been almost\r\nimpossible for man to have attained his present degree of\r\ncivilization, if it had not been given him by nature in such\r\nabundance. Its uses have already been described in the arts of\r\nbrick-making, pottery, &c. Besides these three principal primitive\r\nearths just described, there are seven others, having several\r\nproperties in common, yet each possessing its different and specific\r\nproperties, and evidently designed by nature for different purposes of\r\nutility.\r\n\r\n     _Specific_, belonging to its particular species.\r\n\r\n     _Utility_, usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Volcano?\r\n\r\nAn opening in the surface of the earth, or in a mountain, from which\r\nare ejected smoke, flames, stones, lava, &c. Beneath the outer crust\r\nof the earth inflammable materials appear to exist, which different\r\ncauses excite into combustion. Volcanoes are supposed to owe their\r\norigin to the metals and minerals which form the basis of earths and\r\nalkalies; and which, when ignited, expand,--shake the rocky\r\nfoundations,--and sometimes, bursting through, produce all the\r\ndestructive effects of earthquakes. They break forth under the sea, as\r\nwell as the land, and throw up mountains which rise above the level of\r\nthe water. During an eruption of Vesuvius, A.D. 79, three cities,\r\nHerculaneum, Pompeii, and Stabi\xc3\xa6, were overwhelmed, and lay buried\r\nbeneath the matter ejected from the volcano until within a few years,\r\nwhen excavations were made and many relics discovered;--streets,\r\nhouses, papyri, (manuscripts,) grain, fruit, bread, medicines, &c.\r\n&c., all in a remarkable state of preservation, have been found just\r\nas they were left by the terrified inhabitants at the time of the\r\neruption!\r\n\r\n     _Eruption_, an issuing or breaking forth with violence.\r\n\r\n     _Ejected_, thrown out.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there many Volcanoes?\r\n\r\nThere are upwards of two hundred volcanoes upon the globe; more than\r\none half of them are in America and Oceanica The most noted volcanoes\r\nin America are Cotopaxi (the highest in the world), near Quito;\r\nPopocatapetl, in Mexico; Cosiguina, and the Water Volcano, in\r\nGuatemala. In France, Spain, Portugal, and many other countries, there\r\nare districts which show the former existence of volcanoes, which have\r\nlong been extinct; near Naples, in an area of two hundred square\r\nmiles, there are sixty craters, some of them larger than Vesuvius; in\r\none of these, the town of Cumea has stood for three thousand years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you say of new islands formed by Volcanic Agency?\r\n\r\nMany examples of new islands rising out of the sea by volcanic action\r\nare on record. Some of them are permanent, but others, after a time,\r\ndisappear. Teneriffe, Iceland, Sicily, St. Helena; part of Sumatra,\r\nJava, Japan; and the Sandwich Islands, seem to have been upheaved by\r\nvolcanic agency; Hawaii, the largest of the last-named group, contains\r\nan area of four thousand square miles, and rises eighteen thousand\r\nfeet above the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Earthquakes?\r\n\r\nShakings or vibrations of the ground; sometimes accompanied by rents,\r\nand rockings or heavings of the surface, so as to overthrow buildings,\r\nand swallow up towns and large tracts of country. They are attended\r\nwith a terrible subterranean noise, like thunder, and sometimes with\r\nan eruption of fire or water, or else of smoke or winds.\r\n\r\n     _Subterranean_, underground.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is supposed to cause them?\r\n\r\nAn electrical action between the atmosphere and some deep sub-strata;\r\nor the sudden formation of gaseous matter beneath the surface of the\r\nearth by internal volcanic fires. Many hot countries, where much\r\nelectrical disturbance takes place, are very subject to them:\r\nearthquakes almost always precede volcanic eruptions; an open volcano,\r\nalso, probably diminishes the force of earthquakes, by the vent which\r\nit affords. Earthquakes, at different times, have been productive of\r\nthe most terrific effects: towns and cities have been swallowed up,\r\nand thousands of people destroyed by them. The island of Jamaica is\r\nremarkable for the earthquakes which frequently happen there.\r\n\r\n     _Precede_, to go before.\r\n\r\n     _Vent_, opening.\r\n\r\n     _Terrific_, full of terror, dreadful.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Jamaica situated?\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies,--a large group of fertile islands which lie\r\nbetween North and South America. Jamaica is the principal one of those\r\nwhich belong to the English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE, SCULPTURE, USE OF MONEY, NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by Architecture?\r\n\r\nThe art of building or erecting edifices fit for the habitation of\r\nman, to defend him from the weather, and for his domestic comfort and\r\nconvenience; for devotion, trade, and other purposes, and for the use\r\nof civilized life in every capacity.\r\n\r\n     _Capacity_, state, condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not this an art of great antiquity?\r\n\r\nIt is almost as ancient as human society; the changes of the seasons\r\nfirst led men to build themselves huts or cabins, into which they\r\nmight retire for shelter; in process of time, their manner of building\r\ngradually improved, and habitations were constructed of more stately\r\nforms and elegant proportions, and greater skill and variety were\r\ndisplayed in their ornaments Hence arose the Five Orders or manners of\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what were the first huts composed?\r\n\r\nProbably of the branches of trees driven into the ground, and covered\r\nwith mud and stubble; at length, as men became more expert, they\r\nplaced trunks of trees upright, and laid others across them to sustain\r\nthe outer coverings; from this they took the hint of a more regular\r\narchitecture, and built edifices of brick and stone; the trunks of\r\ntrees which supported their dwellings gave them a notion of pillars or\r\ncolumns, which they afterwards erected of more durable materials.\r\nAmong uncivilized tribes at this day, some reside underground, having\r\ntheir dirty dwellings entirely closed during the winter months; in\r\nwarmer regions, their habitations are built of stakes, leaves, and\r\nturf, in the shape of a soldier\'s tent. In Africa, their kraals or\r\nhuts are constructed in this manner, but of a circular form, with a\r\nhole at the top to let out the smoke. In many of the South Sea\r\nIslands, the natives, when first discovered, had progressed still\r\nfurther, having learnt to elevate the roofs on poles, and to fill in\r\nthe sides of their houses with boughs or rushes, mud or sods.\r\n\r\n     _Probably_, most likely.\r\n\r\n     _Edifice_, a building.\r\n\r\n     _Notion_, idea.\r\n\r\n     _Durable_, lasting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat people are represented by the ancient writers as having brought\r\nthe art of Building to a greater state of perfection?\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the city of Tyre, to whom Solomon had recourse for\r\nworkmen to build the Temple. Isaias, in his twenty-third chapter,\r\nspeaks of the Tyrians and Egyptians, as having brought it to a great\r\ndegree of magnificence; as may be drawn from the various accounts\r\nhanded down to us, and the remains of their obelisks, pyramids, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is an Obelisk?\r\n\r\nA very high and slender four-sided pyramid, raised as an ornament in\r\nsome public place; and frequently covered with inscriptions and\r\nhieroglyphics.[16] This kind of monument appears to be very ancient;\r\nthey were first made use of to declare to posterity the principal\r\nprecepts of philosophy; to mark the hours of the day by the shadows\r\nwhich they cast on the ground; and, in after-times, to immortalize the\r\nactions of heroes, and perpetuate the memory of persons beloved.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: See Chapter XIV.]\r\n\r\n     _Inscription_, something written or engraved.\r\n\r\n     _Hieroglyphics_, emblems by which words were implied. They\r\n     were used before the invention of alphabets.\r\n\r\n     _Implied_, signified, denoted.\r\n\r\n     _Posterity_, succeeding generations, descendants.\r\n\r\n     _Immortalize_, to render immortal,--which means never-dying;\r\n     to perpetuate the memory of anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Pyramid?\r\n\r\nA solid, massive edifice, rising from a square, triangular, or other\r\nbase, gradually diminishing in size till it ends in a point at the\r\ntop. Like the obelisk, pyramids were sometimes erected to preserve the\r\nmemory of singular events, or to transmit to future ages the glory and\r\nmagnificence of princes; but oftener as funeral monuments and\r\nreceptacles for the dead, particularly kings.\r\n\r\n     _Triangular_, three-sided, having three angles.\r\n\r\n     _Diminishing_, growing smaller.\r\n\r\n     _Receptacle_, the place in which a thing is deposited.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it known who were the erectors of these Buildings?\r\n\r\nNo; it is a curious fact that the Egyptian pyramids, so celebrated for\r\ntheir size and great antiquity, should have the time of their erection\r\nand the names of their founders wrapt in such complete mystery. All\r\nthe different authors who have written concerning them, disagree in\r\ntheir accounts of those who built them, and nothing certain is known\r\nof their history.\r\n\r\n     _Founder_, one who establishes or erects.\r\n\r\n     _Mystery_, profound secresy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat other nations excelled in the art of Building?\r\n\r\nThe Greeks and Romans, from whom we derive it, also greatly excelled\r\nin this art. Grecian architecture was in its highest glory under\r\nPericles. Among the Romans, it arrived at its greatest perfection\r\nunder the Emperor Augustus. The five orders of ornamental architecture\r\ninvented by the ancients, at different times, and on different\r\noccasions, are of Grecian and Italian origin. They are the Tuscan, the\r\nDoric, the Ionic, the Corinthian, and the Composite; each possessing\r\nits peculiar form and beauty, and found in all the principal buildings\r\nof the Christian world.\r\n\r\n     _Christian_, professing the religion of Christ; the term is\r\n     applied to those who believe our Lord Jesus Christ to be the\r\n     only true God and Saviour of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Pericles?\r\n\r\nA celebrated Athenian statesman, orator, and general, who gained\r\nseveral victories over the Lacedemonians and other enemies of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre all the species of ornamental building confined to those nations\r\nalready mentioned?\r\n\r\nBy no means; besides the Grecian and Roman orders, other civilized\r\nnations possess their separate styles; as the Hindoos, Chinese, Moors,\r\n&c.; and nothing can be more grand, harmonious, and picturesque, than\r\neach of these in the beautiful specimens which are to be seen in their\r\nseveral countries. The Saxons, also, had a simple style of\r\narchitecture, distinguished by semi-circular arches, and massive plain\r\ncolumns; the Normans, too, invented a beautiful kind called the\r\nGothic, distinguished by its lightness and the number of its\r\nornaments, and by its pointed arches and pillars carved to imitate\r\nseveral combined together; the Gothic style is found in many old\r\ncathedrals.\r\n\r\n     _Hindoos_, inhabitants of Hindostan, in India.\r\n\r\n     _Moors_, inhabitants of Morocco, a kingdom of Barbary, in\r\n     Africa.\r\n\r\n     _Harmonious_, corresponding in all its parts with equal\r\n     beauty and elegance.\r\n\r\n     _Picturesque_, like a picture.\r\n\r\n     _Saxons_, inhabitants of Saxony, a portion of Germany.\r\n\r\n     _Semi-circular_, only half circular.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the Five Orders of Architecture.\r\n\r\nThe Tuscan (from Tuscany,) is the most simple and devoid of ornament,\r\nand its columns or pillars are plain and massive. The Doric (from the\r\nDorians, in Greece,) is durable and noble in appearance, having its\r\ncolumns plain like the Tuscan, but the upper parts more ornamental.\r\nThe Ionic, (from Iona, in Greece,) is neither so plain as the Doric,\r\nnor so richly elegant as the Corinthian; but is distinguished from the\r\nfirst two orders by having its columns or pillars fluted instead of\r\nplain, and the upper part of them (called the capitals,) adorned by\r\nthe figures of rams\' horns carved on them. The Corinthian is very rich\r\nand delicate, with fluted pillars, and the tops beautifully ornamented\r\nwith leaves, &c. The invention of this order is ascribed to\r\nCallimachus, a Corinthian sculptor. The Composite is compounded of the\r\nother four; it is very much like the Corinthian, and is also called\r\nthe Roman or Italian order.\r\n\r\n     _Devoid_, free from, destitute.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Sculpture?\r\n\r\nThe art of cutting or carving wood, stone, and other materials; and\r\nforming of them various figures or representations of men, beasts and\r\nother objects. The term is mostly limited to carving images or statues\r\nin stone. This art is of great antiquity; the sacred writings inform\r\nus of it in many passages, as for instance in those in which are\r\nmentioned Laban\'s images, carried away by Rachel; the golden calf of\r\nthe Israelites, &c. Sculpture as an art is probably more ancient than\r\npainting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat country was the most highly celebrated for its sculpture?\r\n\r\nGreece, which produced many celebrated sculptors, of whom the most\r\neminent were Phidias, an Athenian, the great master of this art, who\r\nlived in the time of Pericles, 408 years before Christ; Lysippus, a\r\nnative of Sicyon, near Corinth; and Praxiteles, a native of Magna\r\nGrecia.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat event proved fatal to this art?\r\n\r\nThe death of Alexander the Great was followed by a visible decline in\r\nall the fine arts; but the fatal blow to their existence was given by\r\nthe success of the conquering Romans, who reduced Greece to a Roman\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas Sculpture always performed in Stone?\r\n\r\nNo; at first statues and other figures were formed of wood or baked\r\nclay, afterwards of stone, marble and metals; though these last were\r\nnot brought to any degree of perfection, till about three hundred\r\nyears before Christ. The Greeks were famous for their works in ivory;\r\nthe great master of the art of carving statues in it was Phidias.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat progress did the Romans make in Sculpture?\r\n\r\nSculpture, during their early history, existed rather as a plant of\r\nforeign growth, partially cultivated by them, than as a native\r\nproduction of their own land. They collected, indeed, some of the most\r\nexquisite samples of Grecian sculpture, and invited to their capital\r\nthe yet remaining sculptors of Greece, by whose labors not only Rome\r\nitself was embellished, but also many of the cities of Asia Minor,\r\nSpain, and Gaul, then under the Roman dominion; yet the taste for\r\nsculpture does not appear to have been cultivated in any measure\r\ncorresponding with the advantages thus afforded them in the study of\r\nthe best models of the art. The best works were produced by Greek\r\nartists, and chiefly Athenian, while the attempts of the Romans were\r\nunskilfully executed.\r\n\r\n     _Gaul_, the ancient name of France.\r\n\r\n     _Model_, pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid it always continue thus?\r\n\r\nNo; from the time of the Emperor Constantine, sculpture, and the rest\r\nof the fine arts, gradually revived. While inspired, perhaps, with a\r\ntaste for sculpture by means of the scattered remains of Grecian art,\r\nthe Roman artists drew, at the same time, from their own resources,\r\nand were by no means servile copyists of the sculptors of a former\r\nage. The first academy of the art was founded at Florence, in 1350,\r\nand at the close of the same century, sculpture was firmly established\r\nin Italy, and itinerant sculptors, not unskilful in their art,\r\nwandered from thence to Germany, France, and even to England. The most\r\neminent master of the art was Michael Angelo, born in 1474, who was\r\nalso a painter and architect; from his time, to the latter end of the\r\nlast century, sculpture again gradually declined, but under Canova, a\r\nnative of Possagno, in the Venetian Alps, it revived. He was born in\r\n1757. Besides the above mentioned, were a number of others of various\r\ndegrees of talent, as well as some still living.\r\n\r\n     _Servile_, slavish, mean.\r\n\r\n     _Itinerant_, wandering.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen was the knowledge of Sculpture introduced into England?\r\n\r\nAt the time of its conquest by the Romans; but the art appears to have\r\nbeen very rude and imperfect. From the time of the Norman invasion,\r\nand still further in the time of the Crusades, an improvement,\r\nhowever, began to show itself in British sculpture. But it is probable\r\nthat most of their best architectural and sculptural works were\r\nexecuted by foreigners, members of those societies of wandering\r\nsculptors before mentioned. Under Edward the Third, the art appears to\r\nhave been much cultivated by Englishmen. It is well known that two\r\nItalian sculptors were employed in England during the sixteenth\r\ncentury. John of Padua, a pupil of Michael Angelo, was master of works\r\nto Henry the Eighth. In the reign of Charles the First, English\r\nsculptors flourished, although their works are of a very low order.\r\n\r\n     _Invasion_, hostile entrance upon the rights or possessions\r\n     of another.\r\n\r\n     _Architectural_, belong to Architecture.\r\n\r\n     _Sculptural_, belonging to Sculpture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATHERING TURPENTINE BY SCRAPING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTILLING TURPENTINE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith whom may the School of British Sculptors be considered as\r\ncommencing?\r\n\r\nWith Banks, born in 1738, and Bacon, born in 1740; these were in every\r\nrespect English artists. But the most eminent worker in the art which\r\nthat country has yet produced, was John Flaxman, born in 1755. Our own\r\ncountry also may boast of sculptors of superior talents, and from the\r\nbeautiful specimens of the art which have appeared, the attainment of\r\na high degree of excellence in it is to be anticipated.\r\n\r\n     _Attainment_, the act of arriving at or reaching.\r\n\r\n     _Anticipated_, expected, foreseen.\r\n\r\n\r\nGive me a short account of this art in Germany, France, and Spain.\r\n\r\nIn these countries, as in England and the United States, during their\r\nearly history, many of the best works were executed by Italians.\r\nGermany appears to have made little progress in sculpture before the\r\nseventeenth century; since that period, it has produced sculptors of\r\nsome eminence, although it is more celebrated for its writers on the\r\nart, than for artists of eminence in its practice. In France,\r\nsculptors of some talent are mentioned as early as the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Girardon and Puget were the most celebrated artists of this\r\nperiod. Spanish history gives a long list of native sculptors, from\r\nthe commencement of the same century, but many of them are but little\r\nknown beyond their own country. Berruguete, a pupil of Michael Angelo,\r\nappears to have founded the first regular school of the art. Paul de\r\nCespides, and in the eighteenth century, Philip de Castro, were the\r\nmost eminent among them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen was the use of Money first introduced?\r\n\r\nIt is not known with certainty: there is, however, reason to believe\r\nthat both gold and silver were very early used as money in Egypt and\r\nAsia: it was afterwards introduced into Carthage and Greece; whence it\r\nwas brought to Rome; and from that city spread gradually westward,\r\nthrough all the Roman dominions. Before the use of money was\r\nintroduced, the only means of trade was by barter, or the exchange of\r\none commodity for another, a custom long retained by uncivilized\r\nnations. In time, however, men discovered the necessity of something\r\nwhich would enable them to trade with greater facility; the first\r\nmention of money is in the time of Abraham, who, we are told in the\r\nBible, paid "four hundred sides of silver of common current money,"\r\nfor a burying place.\r\n\r\n     _Current_, generally received, passing from hand to hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere was Carthage?\r\n\r\nCarthage, now Tunis, was a commercial city, situated on the Northern\r\nCoast of Africa, which long contended for the dominion of the\r\nMediterranean with the Romans; but, after three wars, it was taken and\r\ndestroyed by the Roman general, Scipio Africanus, in the year 251\r\nbefore Christ.\r\n\r\n     _Commercial_, carrying on commerce or trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what substances was Money usually made?\r\n\r\nOf metals, especially the precious metals, because they possess great\r\nvalue in small bulk; may be kept for any length of time without loss;\r\nand their value, although not altogether invariable, yet, generally\r\nspeaking, changes only by slow degrees, and is less susceptible of\r\nfluctuation than that of most other articles. At different times, and\r\namongst various nations, however, other things, in the scarcity of\r\nmetal, have been substituted for it, as shells, wood, leather, paper,\r\nor even pasteboard on extraordinary occasions.\r\n\r\n     _Fluctuation_, unsteadiness; a wavering.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what form was money generally made?\r\n\r\nThe form of money has been more various than its materials; the\r\nancient Britons used as money, rings or bars of iron or tin; the\r\nLacedemonians used iron bars quenched with vinegar. The money of most\r\nnations usually bore an impression peculiar to themselves, as, for\r\ninstance, the sicle of the Jews was marked with the golden pot of\r\nmanna on one side, and Aaron\'s rod on the other; other coins with the\r\nfigures of animals, &c.; in shape, coins were either round, irregular,\r\nor square.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave the terms Money and Coin the same signification?\r\n\r\nNot exactly; by money is understood any matters, such as metal, wood,\r\nleather, glass, horn, paper, fruits, shells, &c., which have currency\r\nas a medium in commerce. Coin is a particular species always made of\r\nmetal, and struck off according to a certain process called coining;\r\nit is not of equal antiquity with money. In fact, the very commodities\r\nthemselves were the first moneys, that is, were current one for\r\nanother by way of exchange. Coin is a piece of metal converted into\r\nmoney, by the impression of certain marks or figures thereon. The\r\nfirst coining of silver took place at Rome, two hundred and\r\nsixty-nine, and of gold, two hundred and six years before Christ: the\r\nRomans, after the commonwealth, stamped their coins with the image of\r\nthe reigning emperor, which custom was followed by most civilized\r\nnations. Coins were, and are, frequently, struck in commemoration of a\r\nparticular event or celebrated person.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen was the use of stamped coin introduced into Britain?\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of the Romans in that island, the natives imitated\r\nthem, coining both gold and silver with the images of their kings\r\nstamped upon them; but the Romans, when they subdued the nation,\r\nsuppressed also their coins, and obliged them to use their own; hence\r\nthe number of Roman coins found among the relics of antiquity in that\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n     _Suppressed_, put aside, hindered from circulation.\r\n\r\n     _Relics_, remains.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does the first coined money in ancient Britain appear to have\r\nbeen?\r\n\r\nCopper money; but after the arrival of the Saxons in England, scarcely\r\nany copper money was used for many centuries, nor did it become common\r\ntill 1672; it was first used in Scotland and Ireland in 1340.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Mint?\r\n\r\nA place established by public authority for coining money. In the\r\nUnited States, the first mint was in Philadelphia; branches have been\r\nestablished in other parts of the Union. In most countries, the\r\nprivilege of coining money is regarded as a prerogative of the\r\nsovereign power. Formerly, in Great Britain, cities, towns, and even\r\nindividuals, were allowed to coin money for the convenience of trade;\r\nbut now this is forbidden, except at the Mint in the Tower of London.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by Navigation?\r\n\r\nThe science or art by which the mariner is taught to conduct his ship\r\nfrom one place to another. Some, perhaps, will consider the formation\r\nand use of the Ark, as a first step towards the invention of this art;\r\nbut it is an erroneous idea, because the direction and means for\r\naccomplishing this immense work were afforded by God, for the\r\npreservation of righteous Noe and his family. Besides, nothing is\r\nrecorded of any means or of any necessity for its occupants\r\n_navigating_ it to any particular place, or from one place to another;\r\nno intention of this sort is apparent, the ark being merely a vast\r\nshelter, rendered capable of floating on the water.\r\n\r\n     _Erroneous_, wrong, in error.\r\n\r\n     _Apparent_, manifest, made to appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat probably gave the first idea of Navigation?\r\n\r\nAccident most likely showed that wood always floats; and on the fallen\r\ntrunk of a tree, perhaps, some one ventured beyond his depth, away\r\nfrom the land. The trunk of a tree, hollowed out, for a more\r\nconvenient position of the body, formed the canoe, usually found among\r\nuncivilized nations to this day. From this rude beginning, at great\r\nintervals of time, and a slow pace of improvement, the art has at\r\nlength arrived at its present state of advancement.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat nation first applied this art to the purposes of Trade?\r\n\r\nThe Phenicians (especially those of Tyre, their capital city, and\r\nSidon,) were the first who adapted it to the purposes of commerce,\r\nand constructed vessels fit to make voyages to foreign countries; the\r\npoverty and narrowness of their land, as well as their vicinity to two\r\nor three good ports, and their natural genius for traffic, urging them\r\nto seek foreign supplies. We hear of them trading to Arabia, India,\r\nPersia, Greece, Africa, Spain, and even as far as Britain.\r\n\r\n     _Vicinity_, nearness, neighborhood.\r\n\r\n     _Traffic_, Trade, commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the Phenicians?\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Phenicia, a country of Syria, in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich was the more ancient city, Tyre or Sidon?\r\n\r\nSidon,--having been built, as is supposed, soon after the Flood, by\r\nSidon, the eldest son of Chanaan. Tyre, about 25 miles to the south,\r\nwas built about the year 1252 before Christ, by a colony from Sidon.\r\nThe Phenicians planted numerous colonies on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean and the Atlantic, and diffused, to a great extent, among\r\ntheir uncivilized neighbors the arts and improvements of civilized\r\nlife. One of their most celebrated colonies was that founded by them\r\non the northern coast of Africa; and it was this colony that built the\r\nfamous city of Carthage.\r\n\r\n     _Diffused_, spread abroad, scattered.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid not Carthage afterwards become as flourishing as the parent city\r\nof Tyre?\r\n\r\nIn time, Carthage not only equalled Tyre itself, but surpassed\r\nit,--pursuing the course the Phenicians had begun, and sending its\r\nmerchant fleets through Hercules\' Pillars, (now the Straits of\r\nGibraltar,) along the western coast of Africa, and northwards, along\r\nthe coast of Europe, visiting particularly Spain, Gaul, &c. They even\r\nundertook voyages, the sole object of which was to discover new\r\ncountries and explore unknown seas. The Carthaginians appear to have\r\nbeen the first who undertook voyages solely for the sake of\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere not both these celebrated cities destroyed?\r\n\r\nTyre, whose immense riches and power were the subject of many ancient\r\nhistories, was destroyed by the Grecian Emperor Alexander the Great,\r\nand its navigation and commerce transferred by him to Alexandria, a\r\nnew city which he meditated making his capital. Alexandria, in a short\r\ntime, became the most important commercial city in the world. Thus\r\narose navigation among the Egyptians; it was afterwards so\r\nsuccessfully cultivated by them, that Tyre and Carthage (which last,\r\nas before mentioned, was subdued by the Romans,) were quite forgotten.\r\n\r\n     _Transferred_, removed.\r\n\r\n     _Capital_, chief city or town in a state or kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Alexander the Great?\r\n\r\nThe son of Philip, King of Macedonia, in Greece; he was celebrated for\r\nhis great ambition, and the number of his conquests; he overturned the\r\nPersian empire, and subdued many cities and provinces in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid not Alexandria undergo the same fate as Tyre and Carthage?\r\n\r\nEgypt was at last reduced to a Roman province, after the battle of\r\nActium, and its trade and navigation fell into the hands of the\r\nEmperor Augustus, in whose time Alexandria was little inferior to\r\nRome; and the magazines of the capital of the world were supplied with\r\nmerchandise from the capital of Egypt. Alexandria, however, at last\r\nunderwent the fate of Tyre and Carthage, being surprised by the\r\nSaracens, who overran the northern parts of Africa; and though it\r\ncontinued, for a while, to enjoy a considerable portion of the\r\ncommerce of the Christian merchants, it afterwards remained in a\r\nlanguishing condition: but still, even at this day, it is a place of\r\nconsiderable trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the Saracens?\r\n\r\nA Mahommedan nation, occupying a portion of what is now called Arabia.\r\nThey extended their conquests over a large portion of Asia, northern\r\nAfrica, and Spain. Their name is derived from the word _Sara_, a\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat effect had the Fall of the Roman Empire on Navigation?\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Roman empire not only drew along with it its learning\r\nand the polite arts, but also the art of navigation; the Barbarians,\r\ninto whose hands the empire fell, contenting themselves with enjoying\r\nthe spoils of those whom they had conquered, without seeking to follow\r\ntheir example in the cultivation of those arts and that learning which\r\nhad rendered Rome and its empire so famous.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat other people, about this period, distinguished themselves in the\r\nart of Navigation?\r\n\r\nThe Saracens or Arabians, whose fleets now rode triumphant in the\r\nMediterranean; they had taken possession of Cyprus, Rhodes, and many\r\nof the Grecian islands, and extended their commerce and their\r\ndiscoveries in the East, far beyond the utmost knowledge of their\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat other circumstance also prevented commercial intercourse from\r\nceasing altogether?\r\n\r\nConstantinople, though often threatened by the fierce invaders, who\r\nspread desolation over Europe, was so fortunate as to escape their\r\ndestructive rage. In this city, the knowledge of ancient arts and\r\ndiscoveries was preserved; and commerce continued to flourish there,\r\nwhen it was almost extinct in every other part of Europe.\r\n\r\n     _Desolation_, destruction, ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the citizens of Constantinople confine their trade to the Islands\r\nof the Archipelago, and the adjacent coast of Asia?\r\n\r\nNo, they took a wider range; and, following the course which the\r\nancients had marked out, imported the productions of the East Indies\r\nfrom Alexandria. When Egypt was torn from the Roman Empire by the\r\nArabians, the industry of the Greeks discovered a new channel by which\r\nthe productions of India might be conveyed to Constantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid not the Barbarians, after a while, turn their attention to\r\nNavigation and Commerce?\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the brave among these nations well settled in their new\r\nprovinces--some in Gaul, as the Franks; others in Spain, as the Goths;\r\nand others in Italy, as the Lombards,--than they began to learn the\r\nadvantages of these arts, and the proper methods of managing them,\r\nfrom the people they had subdued; and that with so much success, that\r\nthey even improved upon them, and set on foot new institutions for\r\ntheir advantage. To the Lombards, in particular, is usually ascribed\r\nthe invention and use of banks, book-keeping, and exchanges. Thus the\r\npeople of Italy, and particularly those of Venice and Genoa, have the\r\nglory of restoring to Europe the advantages that had been destroyed by\r\ntheir own ravages.\r\n\r\n     _Institutions_, laws, regulations.\r\n\r\n     _Exchange_, a species of mercantile transactions by which\r\n     the debts due to persons at a distance are paid by order,\r\n     draft, or bill of exchange, without the transmission either\r\n     of money or goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the Franks?\r\n\r\nA people who settled in Gaul; from them it took the name of Franconia,\r\nor France.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the Goths?\r\n\r\nAn ancient people, who inhabited that part of Sweden called Gothland;\r\nand afterwards spread themselves over great part of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the Lombards?\r\n\r\nThe Lombards, or Longobardi, were, like the Franks, a nation of\r\nGermany; who, upon the decline of the Roman Empire, invaded Italy,\r\nand, taking the city of Ravenna, erected a kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Ravenna?\r\n\r\nIn Central Italy. It is the capital of a province of the same name; it\r\nis an ancient town, and the see of an archbishop.\r\n\r\n     _See_, the seat of episcopal power; the diocese of a bishop.\r\n\r\n     _Episcopal_, belonging to a bishop.\r\n\r\n     _Archbishop_, the presiding bishop of a province.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAND CANAL, VENICE, ITALY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the origin of the city of Venice?\r\n\r\nIn the Adriatic Sea were a great number of marshy islands, separated\r\nonly by narrow channels, but well screened and almost inaccessible,\r\ninhabited by a few fishermen. To these islands the people of Veneti (a\r\npart of Italy, situated along the coasts of the gulf,) retired when\r\nAlaric, King of the Goths, ravaged Italy. These new Islanders, little\r\nimagining that this was to be their fixed residence, did not, at\r\nfirst, think of forming themselves into one community, but each of the\r\n72 islands continued a long while under its respective masters, and\r\nformed a distinct commonwealth.\r\n\r\n     _Adriatic Sea_, a name given to the Gulf of Venice.\r\n\r\n     _Commonwealth_, a republic, a government in which the\r\n     supreme power is lodged in the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat circumstance caused them to unite?\r\n\r\nTheir commerce becoming considerable enough to awaken the jealousy of\r\ntheir neighbors, they united in a body for their mutual protection:\r\nthis union, first begun in the 6th century and completed in the 8th,\r\nlaid the foundation of the future grandeur of the state of Venice.\r\nFrom the time of this union, fleets of their merchantmen sailed to all\r\nthe ports of the Mediterranean; and afterwards to those of Egypt,\r\nparticularly to Cairo, a new city, built by the Saracen princes, on\r\nthe banks of the Nile, where they traded for spices, &c. The Venetians\r\ncontinued to increase their trade by sea and their conquests on land\r\ntill 1508, when a number of jealous princes conspired against them to\r\ntheir ruin; which was the more easily effected in consequence of their\r\nEast Indian commerce, of which the Portuguese and French had each\r\nobtained a share.\r\n\r\n     _Conspired_, united together in a plot.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the signification of Mediterranean?\r\n\r\nInclosed within land, or remote from the ocean. It is more\r\nparticularly used to signify the sea which flows between Europe and\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad not Venice a formidable rival in a neighboring republic?\r\n\r\nGenoa, which had applied itself to navigation at the same time with\r\nVenice, and with equal success, was long its dangerous rival, disputed\r\nwith it the empire of the sea, and shared with it the trade of Egypt,\r\nand other parts, both of the East and West. Jealousy soon broke out;\r\nand, the two republics coming to blows, there was almost continual war\r\nbetween them for three centuries: at length, towards the end of the\r\n14th century, the strife was ended by the fatal battle of Chioza; the\r\nGenoese, who till then had usually the advantage, lost all, and the\r\nVenetians, almost become desperate, at one decisive blow, beyond all\r\nexpectation, secured the empire of the sea and their superiority in\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n     _Decisive_, final, conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere is Genoa situated?\r\n\r\nIn the north-western part of Italy. It was formerly a flourishing\r\nrepublic, but belongs now to Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat event likewise contributed to the more rapid progress and\r\ndiffusion of Navigation and Commerce?\r\n\r\nThe Crusades: for the Genoese, Pisans, and Venetians, furnished the\r\nfleets which carried those vast armies, composed of all the nations of\r\nEurope, into Asia, upon this wild undertaking, and also supplied them\r\nwith provisions and military stores. Other travellers, also, besides\r\nthose whom religious zeal sent forth to visit Asia, ventured into\r\nremote countries, from motives either of commercial advantage, or\r\nthose of mere curiosity.\r\n\r\n     _Zeal_, devotion, enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the Pisans?\r\n\r\nInhabitants of Pisa, an ancient town of Tuscany; it was once a great\r\nindependent republic, and is still adorned with noble edifices. Pisa\r\nhas long been celebrated for its remarkable leaning tower. Tuscany is\r\na beautiful and fruitful territory of Italy; its capital, until the\r\nyear 1859, was Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat were the Crusades?\r\n\r\nHoly wars, or expeditions, undertaken by the Christians against the\r\nTurks and Saracens, to recover Palestine, between the years 1100 and\r\n1400.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat causes led to these wars?\r\n\r\nMany circumstances contributed to give rise to them. They were\r\nundertaken, first, with a view to protecting the devout Christian\r\npilgrims, who were in the habit of frequenting the venerable places\r\nwhere our Saviour had lived, taught, suffered, and triumphed, from the\r\nfury and avarice of the heathens; secondly, with a view to getting\r\npossession of the Holy Land itself, and of annexing it to Christendom;\r\nand thirdly, to break down the power of Mohammedanism, and to elevate\r\nthe Cross in triumph and victory over Palestine.\r\n\r\n     _Avarice_, an excessive desire of gain.\r\n\r\n     _Annexing_, adding, joining.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat badge or sign was worn by those who engaged in the Crusades?\r\n\r\nThey distinguished themselves by crosses of different colors, worn on\r\ntheir clothes; from which they took the name of Crois\xc3\xa9s, or\r\nCross-bearers; each nation wore different colors: for instance, the\r\nEnglish had white crosses, the French red, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what invention is the art of Navigation much indebted?\r\n\r\nTo that of the Mariner\'s Compass, in the beginning of the 14th\r\ncentury; and from this period may be dated the present perfection of\r\nthis useful art.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have given me an account of the restoration of Navigation in\r\nSouthern Europe: did not the inhabitants of the North also turn their\r\nattention to it?\r\n\r\nYes: about the same time, a new society of merchants was formed in the\r\nnorthern parts, which not only carried commerce to the greatest\r\nperfection of which it was capable, till the discovery of the Indies,\r\nbut also formed new codes of useful laws for its regulation.\r\n\r\n     _Codes_, books or writings setting forth certain laws or\r\n     rules respecting particular subjects; books of civil laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre Navigation and Commerce inseparably connected with each other?\r\n\r\nIt may be considered as a general maxim, that their union is so\r\nintimate, that the fall of one inevitably draws after it that of the\r\nother; and that they will always either flourish or decline together\r\nmay be seen, by examining the reason of their passing successively\r\nfrom the Venetians, Genoese, &c., to the Portuguese and Spaniards, and\r\nfrom them to the English, Dutch, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Maxim_, rule, an established principle.\r\n\r\n     _Intimate_, close.\r\n\r\n     _Inevitably_, without possibility of escape, unavoidably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nMUSIC, PAINTING, POETRY, ASTRONOMY, ARTS AND SCIENCES, ART OF\r\nWRITING, AND CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the earliest accounts of Musical Instruments on record?\r\n\r\nThe earliest accounts of music which we possess are to be found in the\r\nBible, in which the state of the world before the flood is noticed.\r\nJubal is said to have been "the father of them that play upon the harp\r\nand organ;" but it is not to be supposed that these instruments at all\r\nresembled the harp and organ of modern times. Musical instruments, in\r\nthe times of David and Solomon, were used in religious services; and\r\nmusic was certainly employed by the Jews on many other occasions, as\r\nat funerals and weddings, at harvest home, and at festivals of all\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n     _Modern_, opposed to ancient, pertaining to the present\r\n     time, or time not long past.\r\n\r\n     _Festival_, a rejoicing, a feast, a season dedicated to\r\n     mirth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat nation was particularly celebrated for musical talents?\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians; who were so celebrated for their talents in\r\nmusic, that the distinguished philosophers of Greece braved many\r\ndangers, in order to study the science in Egypt; and this, at a period\r\nwhen the Egyptians were far from being in the same high state of\r\ncivilization as their forefathers had been in earlier times. The\r\nhistory and monuments of ancient Egypt have many accounts and\r\nrepresentations of musical instruments, and remains of these have\r\nlately been discovered, so that we have ocular demonstration both of\r\ntheir existence and form.\r\n\r\n     _Civilization_, freedom from barbarity, polish, politeness,\r\n     possession of knowledge and the arts of life.\r\n\r\n     _Ocular_, known or seen by the eye.\r\n\r\n     _Demonstration_, the act of proving with certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn how many divisions may musical instruments be arranged?\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds, namely, _wind_ instruments, as the trumpet, and\r\nthe organ;--_stringed_ instruments, as the harp or lyre, violin, &c.;\r\nand instruments of _concussion_, in which the sound is produced by\r\nstriking a sonorous body, as for instance the drum, bells, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich of these three kinds was the first invented?\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, at the present day, to decide which; but it is most\r\nprobable that instruments with strings were the last invented of the\r\nthree kinds; and it is most likely, that of those in which sound is\r\nproduced by the application of wind, the trumpet or horn was first\r\nused. This instrument, in its rudest form, was ready fashioned to the\r\nhand of man; the horn of a ram or of an ox, or some of the larger\r\nkinds of sea-shells, were soon discovered to possess the power of\r\nproducing sound, by being blown into through a small hole at the\r\npointed end.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat improvement in this instrument would naturally follow?\r\n\r\nMankind having discovered the property possessed by a hollow tube of\r\nproducing a certain sound, soon found that the note varied according\r\nto the length and capacity of the tube. A much greater improvement\r\nsoon after took place; it was discovered that one tube answered the\r\npurpose of many by boring holes in the course of its length, and\r\nproducing various musical sounds by stopping with the fingers certain\r\nof these holes. Most of our modern wind instruments are but\r\nimprovements on the ancient inventions.\r\n\r\n     _Tube_, a pipe; a long hollow body.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas not Vocal Music used before the invention of Instrumental?\r\n\r\n_Vocal_ music, namely, that produced by the human voice, (so called to\r\ndistinguish it from _instrumental_, that produced by instruments,) was\r\nundoubtedly the first: for man had not only the various tones of his\r\nown voice to make his observations on, before any art or instrument\r\nwas found out; but the various natural strains of birds to give him a\r\nlesson in improving it, and in modulating the sounds of which it is\r\ncapable.\r\n\r\n     _Modulating_, forming sound to a certain key.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what circumstance did an ancient poet ascribe the invention of\r\nstringed instruments?\r\n\r\nTo the observation of the winds whistling in the hollow reeds. As for\r\nother kinds of instruments, there were so many occasions for cords or\r\nstrings, that men were not long in observing their various sounds,\r\nwhich might give rise to stringed instruments. Those of concussion, as\r\ndrums and cymbals, might result from the observation of the naturally\r\nhollow noise made by concave bodies when struck.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the most ancient stringed instruments?\r\n\r\nThe most ancient instruments of this kind, whose form is known, are\r\nthose of the ancient Egyptians; among these the harp stands\r\npre-eminent. One of the most celebrated representations of an Egyptian\r\nharp was drawn from a painting discovered in one of the caverns in\r\nthe mountains of Egyptian Thebes, by some travellers: it is called the\r\nTheban harp, and has thirteen strings; its form is extremely elegant.\r\nThis harp is supposed to be one of the kind in use before and at the\r\ntime of Sesostris. Remains of Egyptian harps of a more simple\r\nconstruction, with only four strings, have likewise been discovered.\r\nAmong the monuments of ancient Rome, there are representations of\r\nstringed instruments resembling the harp, but not equal in beauty of\r\nform to the famous Egyptian harp already mentioned.\r\n\r\n     _Pre-eminent_, surpassing others.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Sesostris?\r\n\r\nA King of Egypt, who is said to have reigned some ages before the\r\nsiege of Troy. He appears to have been celebrated for his conquests,\r\nand for the number of edifices he erected to perpetuate his fame.\r\n\r\n     _Perpetuate_, to preserve from extinction; to continue the\r\n     memory of a person or event.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere was Troy?\r\n\r\nTroy, anciently called Ilium, was the capital of Troas, in Asia. It\r\nbecame famous for the ten years\' siege it sustained against the\r\nGreeks; the history of this event is commemorated in the poems of\r\nHomer and Virgil.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not the harp an instrument of high antiquity in Great Britain?\r\n\r\nYes: it was a favorite instrument with the ancient Saxons in Great\r\nBritain. The celebrated Alfred entered the Danish camp disguised as a\r\nharper, because the harpers passed through the midst of the enemy\r\nunmolested on account of their calling. The same deception was\r\nlikewise practised by several Danish chiefs, in the camp of Athelstan,\r\nthe Saxon. The bards, or harpers of old, were the historians of the\r\ntime; they handed down from generation to generation the history of\r\nremarkable events, and of the deeds and lineage of their celebrated\r\nchiefs and princes. The harpers of Britain were formerly admitted to\r\nthe banquets of kings and nobles: their employment was to sing or\r\nrecite the achievements of their patrons, accompanying themselves on\r\nthe harp. No nations have been more famous for their harps and harpers\r\nthan the Welsh and Irish.\r\n\r\n     _Recite_, to repeat or chant in a particular tone or manner.\r\n\r\n     _Achievement_, a great or heroic deed.\r\n\r\n     _Patron_, benefactor, one who bestows favors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat instrument was famous among the ancient Greeks?\r\n\r\nThe Lyre: the invention, or rather discovery, of this instrument is\r\nascribed by them to their most celebrated deities. It is supposed to\r\nhave originated from the discovery of a dead tortoise, the flesh of\r\nwhich had dried and wasted, so that nothing was left within the shell\r\nbut sinews and cartilages: these, tightened and contracted, on account\r\nof their dryness, were rendered sonorous. Some one, Mercury or Apollo,\r\nthey affirm, in walking along, happening to strike his foot against\r\nthe tortoise, was greatly pleased with the sound it produced: thus was\r\nsuggested to him the first idea of a lyre, which he afterwards\r\nconstructed in the form of a tortoise, and strung with the dried\r\nsinews of dead animals. The stringed instruments already described\r\nwere made to give out musical sounds, by causing a vibratory motion in\r\ntheir strings by means of the fingers.\r\n\r\n     _Sinew_, a tendon; that which unites a muscle to a bone.\r\n\r\n     _Cartilage_, a gristly, smooth, solid substance, softer than\r\n     bone.\r\n\r\n     _Vibratory_, shaking.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Mercury?\r\n\r\nThe heathen god of eloquence, letters, &c., and the messenger of the\r\nother gods.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Apollo?\r\n\r\nThe god of music, poetry, medicine, and the fine arts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICKING COTTON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATHERING TEA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Tortoise?\r\n\r\nA well-known animal, with a thick shelly covering, belonging to the\r\norder of reptiles; there are two species, the sea and the land\r\ntortoise; the first named is called a turtle, and affords delicious\r\nfood; land tortoises live to a very great age. It is only one sort\r\nwhich furnishes the beautiful shell so much prized. Tortoises are\r\nfound in many parts of the world. The turtles on the Brazilian shore\r\nare said to be so large as to be enough to dine fourscore men: and in\r\nthe Indian sea, the shells serve the natives for boats.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what are the strings of the Lyre, &c., composed?\r\n\r\nSometimes of either brass or silver wire, &c., but most commonly of\r\ncatgut.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Catgut?\r\n\r\nThe intestines of sheep or lambs, dried or twisted, either singly or\r\nseveral together. Catgut is also used by watch-makers, cutlers, and\r\nother artificers, in their different trades. Great quantities are\r\nimported from France and Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there no other kind of Instruments besides those already\r\ndescribed?\r\n\r\nYes, music and musical instruments have progressively improved; and it\r\nwould be a needless task to enumerate the numbers of instruments of\r\neach kind now in use; many, as for instance the organ, the piano,\r\nmusical boxes, &c., are exceedingly complex and ingenious in their\r\nconstruction, as well as remarkable for the sweetness of their various\r\nsounds; some, as the two first-named, are played with the fingers, and\r\nproduce any melody or combination of sound at the will of the\r\nperformer; others, as the musical-box, barrel-organ, &c., produce a\r\nparticular melody, or a certain number of melodies, by means of\r\nmachinery. In the use of the last-named the performer is not at all\r\nindebted to his own musical skill, as he has only to turn the handle\r\nwhich sets the machinery in motion, and the musical box, or\r\nbarrel-organ, will continue playing till it has finished the tunes to\r\nwhich it is set.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon what principle do these last-mentioned instruments perform?\r\n\r\nThe barrel-organ and musical box both play on nearly the same\r\nprinciple, though the former is turned by a handle, and the latter\r\nonly requires a certain spring to be touched, in order to set it off\r\nor to stop it. Their machinery consists of a barrel pricked with brass\r\npins; when the barrel revolves, these ping lift a series of steel\r\nsprings of different lengths and thicknesses, and the vibration of\r\nthese springs when released, produces the different notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Painting?\r\n\r\nThe art of representing objects in nature, or scenes in human life,\r\nwith fidelity and expression, either in oil or water colors, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Fidelity_, truth, faithfulness.\r\n\r\n     _Oil Colors_, those colors which are mixed up with oil, as\r\n     the others are with water.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not this art of great antiquity?\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest doubt of it; but to name the country where\r\nit was first practised, or the circumstances attending its origin, is\r\nbeyond the power of the historian. About a century after the call of\r\nAbraham, Greek and Egyptian tradition tells us of a colony planted at\r\nSicyon, by an Egyptian, who brought with him the knowledge of painting\r\nand sculpture, and founded the earliest and purest school of Greek\r\nart. The walls of Babylon were adorned with paintings of different\r\nkinds of animals, hunting expeditions, combats, &c. Allusions to this\r\ncustom of the Babylonians, of decorating their walls with paintings,\r\nare found in the Bible.\r\n\r\n     _Tradition_, a history or account delivered from mouth to\r\n     mouth without written memorials; communication from age to\r\n     age.\r\n\r\n     _Allusion_, reference.\r\n\r\n     _Decorating_, ornamenting.\r\n\r\n     _Sicyon_, a kingdom of Peloponnesus, in ancient Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere the Egyptians acquainted with this art?\r\n\r\nIt is now little doubted that, although painting and sculpture existed\r\nin Egypt, and were probably at their highest condition, eighteen\r\ncenturies before the Christian era, yet, at a still earlier period,\r\nthese arts were known in the kingdom of Ethiopia; and it is considered\r\nlikely, that the course of civilization descended from Ethiopia to\r\nEgypt. There is, however, no record of any Egyptian painter in the\r\nannals of the art; and it does not appear that it ever flourished in\r\nthat country, or that other nations were much indebted to Egypt for\r\ntheir knowledge of it.\r\n\r\n     _Era_, age, period.\r\n\r\n     _Ethiopia_, the ancient name of the kingdoms of Nubia and\r\n     Abyssinia, in Africa.\r\n\r\n     _Annal_, record, history.\r\n\r\n     _Exploit_, action, achievement, deed of valor.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave we any notice of this art among the Hebrews?\r\n\r\nThere is no allusion made to the existence of painting among this\r\npeople, and no proof that it was cultivated among them: it is supposed\r\nthat the neglect of this art arose from their not being permitted to\r\nrepresent any object by painting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat progress did the generality of the Eastern nations make in this\r\nart?\r\n\r\nThe art of painting among the Phenicians, Persians, and other Eastern\r\nnations, advanced but slowly. The Chinese appear, until a very recent\r\nperiod, to have contented themselves with only so much knowledge of\r\nthe art as might enable them to decorate their beautiful porcelain and\r\nother wares; their taste is very peculiar, and though the pencilling\r\nof their birds and flowers is delicate, yet their figures of men and\r\nanimals are distorted, and out of proportion; and of perspective they\r\nseem to have but little idea. Latterly, however, a change has taken\r\nplace in Chinese art, and proofs have been given of an attempt to\r\nimitate European skill. The Japanese figures approach more nearly to\r\nbeauty of style than Chinese productions of a similar kind.\r\n\r\n     _Distorted_, having a bad figure.\r\n\r\n     _Perspective_, the science by which things are represented\r\n     in a picture according to their appearance to the eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho are the Japanese?\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Japan, an empire of Eastern Asia, composed of\r\nseveral large islands. They are so similar in feature, and in many of\r\ntheir customs and ceremonies, to the Chinese, as to be regarded by\r\nsome, as the same race of men. The Japanese language is so very\r\npeculiar, that it is rarely understood by the people of other\r\nnations. Their religion is idolatrous; their government a monarchy,\r\ncontrolled by the priesthood. The people are very ingenious, and the\r\narts and sciences are held in great esteem by them. In all respects,\r\nJapan is an important and interesting empire.\r\n\r\n     _Monarchy_, a government in which the power is vested in a\r\n     king or emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy what nations was the art of painting practised with great success?\r\n\r\nBy the Greeks and Romans. Greece produced many distinguished painters,\r\namong whom Apelles was one of the most celebrated; he was a native of\r\nCos, an island in the Archipelago, rather north of Rhodes; he\r\nflourished in the time of Alexander the Great, and witnessed both the\r\nglory and the decay of ancient art: the leading features of his style\r\nwere beauty and grace. But painting was not at any period so\r\ncompletely national in Greece, as sculpture, its sister art; the names\r\nof one hundred and sixty-nine eminent sculptors are recorded, while\r\nonly fifteen painters are mentioned. Zeuxis, of Heraclea, was another\r\nfamous Greek painter, who flourished 400 years before Christ. The\r\nRomans were not without considerable masters in this art, in the\r\nlatter times of the republic, and under the first emperors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat nation is supposed to have known and practised this art even\r\nbefore the foundation of Rome?\r\n\r\nThe Etruscans, inhabitants of Etruria, whose acquaintance with the\r\narts has excited great astonishment among those who have most deeply\r\nsearched into their history, and traced their progress by means of the\r\nbeautiful specimens of their works still extant. Their early works\r\nwere not superior to those of other nations; but either from their\r\nintercourse with Greece, or the original genius of the people, they\r\nhad attained considerable eminence in the arts of painting, sculpture,\r\n&c., before Rome was founded. Pliny speaks of some beautiful pictures\r\nat Ardea and Lanuvium, which were older than Rome: and another author\r\nalso says that before Rome was built, sculpture and painting existed\r\namong them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere was Etruria situated?\r\n\r\nIn Italy, on the west of the Tiber, which separated it from the\r\nterritory of ancient Rome, to which it was afterwards annexed by\r\nconquest. Etruria was the ancient name of Tuscany.\r\n\r\n     _Annexed_, united.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas not the art greatly obscured for some centuries?\r\n\r\nThe irruption of Barbarians into Italy and Southern Europe, proved\r\nfatal to painting, and almost reduced it to its primitive state; it\r\nwas not until after a long period that it was fully restored. The\r\nfirst certain signs of its revival took place about the year 1066,\r\nwhen Greek artists were sent for to adorn several of the cities of\r\nItaly. Cimabue, a native of Florence, in the thirteenth century,\r\ncaught the inspiration of the Greek artists, and soon equalled their\r\nworks. He was both a painter and an architect.\r\n\r\n     _Irruption_, inroad, invasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what did this revolution in its history give rise?\r\n\r\nIt caused it to be distinguished into ancient and modern. The ancient\r\npainting comprehends the Greek and Roman: the modern has formed\r\nseveral schools, each of which has its peculiar character and merit.\r\nThe first masters who revived the art were greatly surpassed by their\r\nscholars, who carried it to the greatest state of perfection, and\r\nadvanced it not only by their own noble works, but also by those of\r\ntheir pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the principal masters of the Italian school?\r\n\r\nRaphael and the celebrated Michael Angelo Buonarotti; the former is\r\nregarded as the prince of modern painters, and is often styled "the\r\ndivine Raphael;" he was born at Urbino, in 1483. Michael Angelo was\r\nborn at Florence, in 1564, and united the professions of painter,\r\nsculptor, architect, poet, and musician. Besides these there were many\r\nother illustrious Italian painters, the principal of whom were\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, Titian, Correggio, the three Caracci, Guido,\r\nParmegiano, Salvator Rosa, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas not Raphael also reckoned as excellent an architect as he was a\r\npainter?\r\n\r\nHe was not only esteemed the best painter in the world, but also the\r\nbest architect; he was at least so admired for skill and taste in\r\narchitecture, that Leo the Tenth charged him with the building of St.\r\nPeter\'s Church at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Leo the Tenth?\r\n\r\nA great Pope, who was an ardent lover and patron of learning and the\r\narts. He was born at Florence, in 1475, and died in 1521.\r\n\r\n\r\nGive me a list of some of the most celebrated painters besides those\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe great painters of the _German_ school were Albert Durer, Holbein,\r\nKneller and Mengs, with several others.\r\n\r\nOf the _Dutch_ school, were Rembrandt, Gerard Dow, Mieris, Ostade,\r\nPolemberg, Berghem, and Wouvermans.\r\n\r\nOf the _Flemish_, Rubens, Teniers, Jordaens, and Vandyck.\r\n\r\nThe admired painters of the _French_ school, were Claude, Poussin, Le\r\nBrun, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe _Spaniards_ also have had their Murillo, Velasquez, &c.\r\n\r\nThe _English_, Hogarth, Wright, Reynolds, Wilson, Northcote,\r\nGainsborough, Morland, Barry, and others.\r\n\r\nThe _Americans_, Washington Allston, Benjamin West, Gilbert Stuart,\r\nJohn Singleton Copley, John Trumbull, G. Stuart Newton, Thomas Cole,\r\nHenry Inman, and a number of others; besides many now living, or but\r\nrecently deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon what materials did the ancients paint their works?\r\n\r\nPrincipally upon wood; the boards or tables were prepared with a thin\r\nground of chalk and size of some kind. Linen cloth or canvas was also\r\nemployed, but there is no evidence of its use before the reign of\r\nNero. Parchment, ivory and plaster were the other materials.\r\n\r\n     _Evidence_, testimony, record.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was Nero?\r\n\r\nOne of the Roman Emperors, a monster of cruelty, extravagance, and\r\ndebauchery; he raised a dreadful persecution against the Christians,\r\nin which St. Paul was beheaded, and St. Peter crucified. At last,\r\nbeing deserted by his army and the senate, he destroyed himself, after\r\na reign of fourteen years.\r\n\r\n     _Debauchery_, wickedness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Poetry?\r\n\r\nThe glowing language of impassioned feeling, generally found in\r\nmeasured lines, and often in rhyme. Most ancient people had their\r\npoets.\r\n\r\n     _Glowing_, warm, energetic.\r\n\r\n     _Impassioned_, full of passion, animated.\r\n\r\n     _Rhyme_, the correspondence of the last sound of one verse\r\n     to the last sound or syllable of another.\r\n\r\n\r\nName a few of the ancient poets.\r\n\r\nDavid was an inspired poet of the Hebrews: Homer, one of the earliest\r\npoets of the Greeks: Ossian, an ancient poet of the Scots: Taliesen,\r\nan ancient poet of the Welsh: and Odin, an early poet of the\r\nScandinavians.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were the Scandinavians?\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Scandinavia, the ancient name of Denmark, Sweden,\r\nand Norway.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat people are regarded as the Fathers of Poetry?\r\n\r\nThe Greeks. Homer was the first and the prince of poets; he celebrated\r\nthe siege of Troy in the Iliad and Odyssey, two epic poems which have\r\nnever been surpassed. In the same kind of composition he was followed,\r\nnine hundred years after, by Virgil, in the Eneid; by Tasso, after\r\nanother fifteen hundred years, in the \'Jerusalem Delivered.\' The\r\nGreeks also boasted of their Pindar and Anacreon in lyric poetry; and\r\nof Aristophanes, Euripides, Sophocles, and Eschylus, in dramatic\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Romans possess any distinguished Poets?\r\n\r\nYes; among the epic poets were Ovid and Tibullus; among dramatists,\r\nPlautus and Terence; of didactic and philosophic poets, Lucretius,\r\nVirgil, Horace, and Silius Italicus. All these were so many miracles\r\nof human genius; and their works afford the models of their respective\r\nspecies of composition. Most of the works of the ancients have in\r\nsentiment, if not in spirit, been translated into English.\r\n\r\n     _Miracles_, wonders.\r\n\r\n     _Genius_, natural talent.\r\n\r\n     _Respective_, particular.\r\n\r\n     _Sentiment_, thought, meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid not the same revolution which undermined the Greek and Roman\r\nempires, and destroyed learning, the arts and sciences, and the taste\r\nfor elegance and luxury, also prove fatal to Poetry?\r\n\r\nIt did; the hordes of barbarians who overran Europe wiped out\r\ncivilization in their progress, and literature, art, and science fled\r\nbefore the wild conquerors to find a refuge in the monastery and the\r\nconvent. Here knowledge was fostered with the love and ardor which\r\nreligion alone can impart. Finally, when the rude barbarians were\r\nconverted, it was to the religious Orders that the world turned for\r\nthe establishment of schools, and it is to the Church alone, in the\r\nperson of her popes, her bishops, and her monks that we are indebted\r\nfor the preservation of learning, and its revival in the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat celebrated Poets marked this revival?\r\n\r\nIn Italy, Dante, Ariosto, Petrarch and Tasso. These were followed, in\r\nFrance, by Racine, Corneille, Boileau, Voltaire, La Fontaine and\r\nDelille; in England, by Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspeare, Milton, Dryden,\r\nPope, Thomson, Young, Collins, Gray, Byron, Coleridge, &c; in\r\nScotland, by Sir Walter Scott; in Ireland, by Thomas Moore; in\r\nGermany, Klopstock, Goethe and Schiller.\r\n\r\n\r\nName some of the distinguished poets of our own country.\r\n\r\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, James Russell\r\nLowell, John G. Whittier, Fitz-Greene Halleck, and many others whose\r\nmeritorious works will be impartially judged by a future age.\r\n\r\n     _Impartially_, justly, without prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\nName the different kinds of Poetry.\r\n\r\nEpic, or historical; dramatic, or representative,--from drama, the\r\nname of all compositions adapted to recitation on the stage--in which\r\nare displayed, for instruction and amusement, all the passions,\r\nfeelings, errors, and virtues of the human race in real life; lyric\r\npoetry, or that suited to music, as songs, odes, &c; didactic, or\r\ninstructive; elegiac, or sentimental, and affecting; satirical, or\r\ncensorious; epigrammatic, or witty and ludicrous; and pastoral, or\r\ndescriptive of country life.\r\n\r\n     _Historical_, relating to history.\r\n\r\n     _Lyric_, pertaining to a lyre.\r\n\r\n     _Didactic_, doctrinal; relating to doctrines or opinions.\r\n\r\n     _Elegiac_, relating to elegy; mournful, sorrowful.\r\n\r\n     _Elegy_, a mournful song: a funeral composition; a short\r\n     poem without points or affected elegance.\r\n\r\n     _Satirical_, severe in language; relating to satire.\r\n\r\n     _Satire_, a poem in which wickedness or folly is censured.\r\n\r\n     _Epigrammatic_, relating to epigram,--a short poem ending in\r\n     a particular point or meaning, understood but not expressed.\r\n\r\n     _Pastoral_, from _pastor_, a shepherd; relating to rural\r\n     employments and those belonging to shepherds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Astronomy?\r\n\r\nThe science which treats of the heavenly bodies, their arrangement,\r\nmagnitudes, distances and motions. The term Astronomy is derived from\r\ntwo Greek words, signifying the _law_ of the _stars_; _astron_ being\r\nthe Greek for star.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can you say of its origin?\r\n\r\nIts origin has been ascribed to several persons, as well as to\r\ndifferent nations and ages. Belus, King of Assyria; Atlas, King of\r\nMauritania; and Uranus, King of the countries situated on the shores\r\nof the Atlantic Ocean, are all recorded as the persons to whom the\r\nworld is indebted for this noble science. Its origin is generally\r\nfixed in Chaldea. Some choose, however, to attribute it to the\r\nHebrews; others to the Egyptians,--from whom, they say, it passed to\r\nthe Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat country is meant by Mauritania?\r\n\r\nMauritania is the name formerly given to a country in the northern\r\npart of Africa. Chaldea is the ancient name for Babylonia, now called\r\nIrak Arabi, a district of Asiatic Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy whom were the heavenly bodies first divided into Constellations or\r\ngroups?\r\n\r\nBy the ancients. The phenomena of the heavens were studied in very\r\nearly ages by several nations of the East. The Chaldeans, the Indians,\r\nthe Chinese and the Egyptians have all left evidence of the industry\r\nand ingenuity with which their observations were conducted.\r\n\r\n     _Phenomena_, appearances.\r\n\r\n     _Ingenuity_, skilfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat progress did they make in Astronomy?\r\n\r\nThey built observatories,--invented instruments for observing and\r\nmeasuring with correctness,--separated the stars into different groups\r\nor constellations, for the more easily finding any particular\r\nstar,--gave particular names to most of the moving stars or planets,\r\nand noted the periods which each took to move through its apparent\r\npath in the heavens; and in many other ways the ancients helped to lay\r\nthe foundations of that mass of astronomical knowledge which men of\r\nlater ages have brought to more maturity.\r\n\r\n     _Constellation_, a cluster of fixed stars; an assemblage of\r\n     stars.\r\n\r\n     _Observatory_, a place so built as to command a view of the\r\n     heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho first taught the true system of the Universe?\r\n\r\nPythagoras, one of the most distinguished philosophers of antiquity.\r\nHe is thought to have been a native of Samos, an island in the\r\nArchipelago; he flourished about 500 years before Christ, in the time\r\nof Tarquin, the last King of Rome. Pythagoras was the first among the\r\nEuropeans who taught that the Earth and Planets turn round the Sun,\r\nwhich stands immovable in the centre;--that the diurnal motion of the\r\nSun and Fixed Stars is not real, but apparent,--arising from the\r\nEarth\'s motion round its own axis, &c. After the time of Pythagoras,\r\nAstronomy sunk into neglect.\r\n\r\n     _Philosopher_, one who studies philosophy.\r\n\r\n     _Philosophy_, all knowledge, whether natural or moral. The\r\n     term is derived from the Greek, _philos_, lover, and\r\n     _sophia_, wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy whom was it revived?\r\n\r\nBy the family of the Ptolemies, kings of Egypt, who founded a school\r\nof astronomy at Alexandria, which produced several eminent\r\nastronomers, particularly one named Hipparchus. The Saracens, on their\r\nconquest of Egypt, became possessed of the knowledge of Astronomy,\r\nwhich they carried with them out of Africa into Spain; and thus, after\r\na long exile, it was introduced afresh into Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid not Astronomy from this time make great progress?\r\n\r\nYes; it made considerable advances, being cultivated by the greatest\r\ngeniuses, and patronized by the greatest princes. The system of the\r\nPtolemies, called the Ptolemaic, had hitherto been used, with some\r\nslight alterations; but Copernicus, an eminent astronomer, born at\r\nThorn, in Polish Prussia, in 1473, adopted the system which had been\r\ntaught by Pythagoras in Greece, five or six hundred years before the\r\ntime of Ptolemy. About the same time with Copernicus flourished Tycho\r\nBrahe, born in Denmark, 1546.\r\n\r\n     _Geniuses_, men gifted with superior mental faculties.\r\n\r\n     _Mental_, belonging to the mind.\r\n\r\n     _Faculties_, powers of doing anything, whether menial or\r\n     bodily; abilities; powers of the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat next greatly forwarded this interesting science?\r\n\r\nThe introduction of telescopes by Galileo, who by their means\r\ndiscovered the small stars or satellites which attend the planet\r\nJupiter; the various appearances of Saturn; the mountains in the Moon;\r\nthe spots on the Sun; and its revolution on its axis.\r\n\r\n     _Satellites_, attendants.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat celebrated Astronomer arose in England?\r\n\r\nThe immortal Sir Isaac Newton, born in 1642, at Woolsthorpe, in\r\nLincolnshire, who has, perhaps, contributed more to the advancement of\r\nthis science than any one who had before existed. Dr. William\r\nHerschel, a native of Hanover, in Germany, born in 1738, likewise\r\nmade many useful discoveries in Astronomy: it was he who first\r\ndiscovered the seventh primary planet, which he named, in honor of\r\nKing George the Third, the Georgium Sidus. George the Third took him\r\nunder his especial patronage, and constituted him his astronomer, with\r\na handsome pension. He resided at Slough, near Windsor, where he died,\r\nin 1822.\r\n\r\n     _Patronage_, support, favor.\r\n\r\n     _Constituted_, appointed to any particular office or rank.\r\n\r\n     _Pension_, yearly allowance of money.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat other circumstance contributed to the advancement of Astronomy?\r\n\r\nThe increasing perfection of our astronomical instruments,--by means\r\nof which, the most important and interesting discoveries with regard\r\nto the heavens have been made. It is now supposed that the myriads of\r\nthe heavenly bodies are all distinct worlds; it is certain, from\r\nobservations made by the aid of the telescope, that the moon has its\r\nmountains, valleys, and caverns. One of the greatest astronomers of\r\nour day was the eminent Father Secci.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are generally meant by the Arts?\r\n\r\nSystems of rules designed to facilitate the performance of certain\r\nactions; in this sense, it stands opposed to science. The terms _art_\r\nand _science_ are often incorrectly used. Science relates to\r\nprinciples, and art to practice. The word art is derived from a Greek\r\nword signifying utility, profit. Arts are divided into liberal and\r\nmechanical.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the Liberal Arts?\r\n\r\nThe liberal arts are those that are noble and ingenious, or which are\r\nworthy of being cultivated without any immediate regard to the\r\npecuniary profit arising from them. They are Poetry, Music, Painting,\r\nSculpture, Architecture, Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric, Astronomy, and\r\nNavigation. The arts which relate more especially to the sight and\r\nhearing are also called Fine Arts.\r\n\r\n     _Pecuniary_, relating to money.\r\n\r\n     _Military_, belonging to soldiers, or to arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do the Fine Arts usually include?\r\n\r\nAll those which are more or less addressed to the sentiment of taste,\r\nand whose object is pleasure; these are more especially Music,\r\nPainting, Sculpture, and Poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the Mechanical Arts?\r\n\r\nThose in which the hand and body are more concerned than the mind, and\r\nwhich are chiefly cultivated for the sake of the profit attending\r\nthem. To this class belong those which furnish us with the necessaries\r\nof life, and which are commonly called trades, as carpentry, weaving,\r\nprinting, &c. There are also many other arts, as the art of writing,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen was the art of Writing invented?\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that the art was invented before the Deluge: it was\r\ncertainly practised long before the time of Moses. There were,\r\ndoubtless, many steps taken in slow succession before the invention of\r\nalphabetic writing. Perhaps the earliest method might have been that\r\nwhich is still employed among the untutored tribes of North American\r\nIndians, who record events by picture-painting of the rudest\r\ndescription. Picture-painting was afterwards gradually converted into\r\nthe hieroglyphical system, which is still the only kind of writing\r\namong the Chinese. It is not known who invented the alphabetic system\r\nof writing.\r\n\r\n     _Deluge_, a flood: the term used in particular to denote\r\n     that mighty flood of water with which God swept away the\r\n     first nations of the earth for their wickedness.\r\n\r\n     _Alphabetic_, from alphabet, the series of written signs of\r\n     language called letters. The word is formed from _alpha_,\r\n     _beta_, the names of the first two letters of the Greek\r\n     alphabet.\r\n\r\n     _Untutored_, ignorant, unlearned.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere not the Egyptians quite early acquainted with this art?\r\n\r\nYes, they were acquainted with two or three kinds of writing, as well\r\nas the one in which symbolical characters were employed, which was not\r\nused for common purposes. On the contrary, such symbols had something\r\nof a sacred character about them, being unknown to the common people,\r\nand only to be deciphered by the priests. Obelisks and pyramids were\r\nthe great national records; and on these the hieroglyphics were\r\nconstantly used, because unintelligible to the people, until expounded\r\nby those who had the exclusive office of explaining them.\r\n\r\n     _Symbolical_, having the nature of signs or symbols--that\r\n     is, representations of different things.\r\n\r\n     _Deciphered_, read, understood, made out.\r\n\r\n     _Unintelligible_, that cannot be understood.\r\n\r\n     _Expounded_, explained, interpreted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere Hieroglyphics employed before or after Alphabetic Writing?\r\n\r\nThey were undoubtedly employed at first from necessity, not from\r\nchoice or refinement; and would never have been thought of, if\r\nalphabetical characters had been known. This style of writing must be\r\nreckoned as a rude improvement upon picture-writing, which had\r\npreviously been used. Hieroglyphics were employed by the Egyptian\r\npriests in after times, as a kind of sacred writing, peculiar to\r\nthemselves, and serving to give an air of mystery to their learning\r\nand religion, though fallen into disuse for other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat materials were employed by ancient nations in Writing?\r\n\r\nThe Eastern nations used tables of stone, brass, and wood, so that the\r\ncharacters were engraved instead of being written in the usual manner.\r\nThe instrument used in writing on wood, was made of metal, and called\r\na _style_. For stone, brass, &c., a chisel was employed. When the bark\r\nand leaves of trees, skins, and other materials of a more pliant\r\nnature, superseded the above-named tables, the chisel and the style,\r\nor stylus, gave way to the reed and cane, and afterwards to the quill,\r\nthe _hair_ pencil (as now used by the Chinese,) and the convenient\r\nlead pencil.\r\n\r\n     _Engraved_, inscribed with the graver, a tool used in\r\n     engraving on stone, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Pliant_, yielding, easily bent.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave not the various nations among whom this useful art has been\r\ncultivated, adopted different ways of arranging their written\r\ncharacters?\r\n\r\nYes. The Hebrews, Chaldeans, Syrians, Arabians, and Egyptians, begin\r\neach line on the right side, and write towards the left. The Greeks,\r\nLatins, and all European nations, write from left to right. The\r\nnatives of China, Japan, Cochin China, Corea, &c., write from the top\r\nto the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere are Cochin China, and Corea?\r\n\r\nCochin China is a country situated in Eastern Asia. Corea is a\r\npeninsula of Asia, subject to China.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by Science?\r\n\r\nA clear and certain knowledge of anything founded on self-evident\r\nprinciples, or demonstration. The term is, however, more particularly\r\napplied to a systematic arrangement of the principles relating to any\r\nbranch of knowledge, and is employed in this sense in opposition to\r\nart: thus the theoretical knowledge of chemistry is ranked as a\r\nscience, but the practical part is called an art; thus it is sometimes\r\nspoken of as a science, sometimes as an art.\r\n\r\n     _Practical_, relating to action, not merely speculative.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Chemistry?\r\n\r\nA science which enables us to discover the peculiar properties of\r\nnatural bodies, either in their simple or compound state, and the\r\nelementary or first principles of which they are composed, by the\r\nprocesses of analysis and combination. Chemistry treats of those\r\nchanges in natural bodies which are not accompanied by _sensible_\r\nmotions.\r\n\r\n     _Compound_, mixed.\r\n\r\n     _Analysis_, a separation of a compound body into the several\r\n     parts of which it consists.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not the knowledge of Chemistry very ancient?\r\n\r\nChemistry, as far as it regards the separating of metals from foreign\r\nmatters in the ore, smelting and refining them, is of the highest\r\nantiquity; it is even supposed to have been understood and practised\r\nin the antediluvian world.\r\n\r\n     _Antediluvian_, before the flood.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat nation appears to have excelled in Chemistry in early times?\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians were no mean proficients in many chemical operations,\r\nespecially in the arts of working metals, softening ivory, vitrifying\r\nflints, and imitating precious stones. Chemistry, however, experienced\r\nthe common fate of all the arts, at the decline of the Eastern empire.\r\n\r\n     _Proficients_, those who have made great progress in any art\r\n     or science.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy whom was it revived?\r\n\r\nAfter having long lain buried, the famous Roger Bacon revived it; and\r\nfrom his time to the present day it has gradually progressed to a\r\nstate of perfection. In former times, the art of chemistry consisted\r\nonly in the knowledge of working metals, &c.; but in latter ages, its\r\nbounds have been greatly enlarged. The knowledge of Chemistry leads to\r\nmany interesting and important discoveries, and the arts and\r\nmanufactures are greatly indebted to its aid; indeed, it is requisite\r\nto be a good chemist, in order to attain to perfection in many of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n     _Requisite_, necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy what other name has Chemistry been known?\r\n\r\nIt was sometimes called _Alchemy_; by which is properly understood a\r\nrefined and mysterious species of chemistry, formerly much practised.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat were its objects?\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the art of converting metals into gold, including the\r\nsearch after the "Philosopher\'s Stone," by which this change was to be\r\neffected; and the discovery of a panacea or medicine for the cure of\r\nall diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the Philosopher\'s Stone?\r\n\r\nA substance, for numbers of years eagerly sought for, which was to\r\nconvert metals, such as lead, copper, &c. into gold. This unknown\r\nsubstance was called the Philosopher\'s Stone, probably on account of\r\nthe number of learned men who engaged in the search after it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNITED STATES SIGNAL STATION, PIKE\'S PEAK, COLORADO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWas this search successful?\r\n\r\nNo; but the delusion lasted several centuries, notwithstanding the\r\nfailures, losses, and disappointments of those engaged in it. Indeed,\r\nso severe and ruinous were these, in many instances, that laws were\r\npassed to forbid the study. In Germany, many of the alchemists who had\r\nthe unfortunate reputation of possessing this wonderful stone were\r\nimprisoned and furnished with apparatus till they should purchase\r\ntheir liberty by making an ounce of gold.\r\n\r\n     _Delusion_, an error arising from false views.\r\n\r\n     _Apparatus_, a complete set of instruments or tools, by\r\n     which anything is made, or any operation performed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas any gold ever produced by this method?\r\n\r\nNot a particle; the story of a stone having the property of converting\r\nthe baser metals into gold being merely an absurd fable: yet, although\r\nthe pursuits of Alchemy were the most preposterous that can be\r\nconceived, the ardor with which they were followed, and the amazing\r\nnumber of experiments made in consequence, led to the discovery of\r\nmany facts to which Chemistry is highly indebted.\r\n\r\n     _Preposterous_, absurd, foolish; contrary to nature or\r\n     reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou inform me that Chemistry enables us to discover the properties of\r\nbodies by means of _analysis_ and _combination_: what do these terms\r\nimply?\r\n\r\nIf a chemist wishes to examine the properties of a compound body, he\r\nproceeds by analysis--that is, by a separation of the substance to be\r\nexamined into its constituent parts. The chemical examination of\r\nbodies is generally effected by producing a change in the _nature_ or\r\n_state_ of the body under examination. This change is frequently\r\nbrought about by the addition of some _other_ substance which forms a\r\ncombination with a part of the substance examined, and leaves the\r\nremainder in a detached state.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy what _means_ do Chemists effect a change in the qualities or states\r\nof natural bodies?\r\n\r\nIt is generally effected by means of _heat_, which has a tendency to\r\nseparate the particles of bodies from each other; or by the _mixture_\r\nor _combination_ of some other matter with the matter intended to be\r\nexamined. The mixture of two or more compounds often produces a\r\ndecomposition by means of chemical _affinity_, a property which\r\ndifferent species of matter have to unite with each other; and which\r\nis sometimes called _elective affinity_. Thus it may be observed,\r\nchemists have not only the power of decomposing natural bodies, but of\r\nproducing by combination various other substances, such as are not\r\nfound in the kingdom of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by _decomposition_?\r\n\r\nIn chemical language, it means the separation of a compound body into\r\nits simple elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nGive me an example.\r\n\r\nWater may be decomposed, and reduced into oxygen and hydrogen,--both\r\nof them simple substances incapable of further decomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not the work of decomposition perpetually going forward?\r\n\r\nYes; and _combustion_ is one of the great agents in this work. By it\r\nanimal and vegetable substances are converted into water and carbonic\r\nacid, by the union of their hydrogen and carbon with the oxygen of the\r\nair. These, in time, are again absorbed by vegetables, and again\r\ndecomposed to set the oxygen at liberty to produce fresh combustions.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf what use are the two remaining substances, Hydrogen and Carbon?\r\n\r\nThese are appropriated by the vegetative organs to their growth and\r\nnourishment, while the oxygen with which the carbon was combined is\r\nabundantly given off to purify the air and render it fit for the\r\nrespiration of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nGive me an idea of the mode in which Chemists ascertain the _affinity_\r\nof bodies, by relating an experiment.\r\n\r\nDissolve a tea-spoonful of sugar of lead in water, and pour the clear\r\nsolution into a decanter or large glass bottle. Then take a small\r\npiece of zinc, and twist round it some brass or copper wire, so as to\r\nlet the ends of the wire depend from it in any agreeable form. Suspend\r\nthe zinc and wire in the solution which has been prepared; in a short\r\ntime, metallic lead will deposit itself on the zinc and along the\r\nwire. This is a beautiful illustration of chemical affinity; the acid,\r\nwhich constitutes a part of the sugar of lead, has a stronger affinity\r\nfor the zinc than for the lead, and, consequently, will combine with\r\nthe zinc, and form a compound which remains in solution, while the\r\nlead is precipitated on the zinc and wire in the form of a brilliant\r\ntree of metal.\r\n\r\n     _Affinity_, in chemistry, that attraction which takes place\r\n     between the elements of bodies, and forms compounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does the word Nature signify?\r\n\r\nIn the above sense, the system of the universe; the creation, the\r\nworks of God. By the kingdom of nature is meant the world and all\r\nthings in it: nature is divided into three kingdoms, the animal,\r\nvegetable, and mineral.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the different states of natural bodies?\r\n\r\nAll bodies are either solid, liquid, or aeriform. By solid bodies are\r\nmeant those whose parts unite so firmly as to resist the impression or\r\npenetration of other bodies; by liquid, those substances whose parts\r\ndo not unite firmly, but have free motion among themselves; by\r\naeriform, fluid substances, having the form or nature of air. Liquid\r\nsubstances are nothing more than solids converted into liquids by\r\nheat, a certain increase of which would convert the liquids into\r\nvapor.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat other name is given to Liquids?\r\n\r\nThey are likewise called fluids: we call the air, also, a fluid,\r\nbecause it flows like a fluid, and light substances will float in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of bodies floating on liquids?\r\n\r\nIt is an established law of nature, that all substances which weigh\r\nless than an equal bulk of any liquid, will float on the surface of\r\nthis liquid. Thus a cork will float on water, while a stone sinks to\r\nthe bottom. The cork will not float in the air, though lighter than\r\nwater; and the stone is not heavier than the _whole_ of the water, but\r\nmore so than a portion of water of its _own bulk_,--and thus it sinks\r\nin it. Stones also differ in their weight or gravity: for instance,\r\nsome of the asbestus kind are _lighter_ than water. Iron, brass,\r\nindeed, nearly all substances, except gold and platina, will float\r\nupon mercury, because they are lighter than this liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of bodies being either solid, liquid, or aeriform?\r\n\r\nWhen the principle of _attraction_ prevails, it causes them to become\r\nsolid; when caloric prevails, they become aeriform. Fluidity is,\r\napparently, a medium between the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the state of Solidity in bodies accounted for?\r\n\r\nThe particles of all bodies are subject to two opposite powers,\r\n_repulsion_ and _attraction_; between which they remain in\r\nequilibrium. While the _attractive_ force remains strongest, the body\r\nremains in a state of solidity; but if heat destroys this force, the\r\nparticles lose their cohesion, and the body ceases to be solid.\r\n\r\n     _Cohesion_, act of sticking together, union of the\r\n     constituent parts of a body.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is supposed to be the most natural state of all bodies?\r\n\r\nSolidity; for by the _combination_ of caloric with them we can reduce\r\nmost substances to the fluid state; while the greatest number of\r\n_liquid_ substances take a _solid_ form by the loss of caloric. Thus,\r\nwater congeals and forms ice; and even the gases show this disposition\r\nto become solid, when they lose their _elasticity_ by forming some\r\n_combination_.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplain the terms _Repulsion_ and _Attraction_.\r\n\r\nRepulsion is a peculiar property in the particles of matter, which\r\ngives them a constant tendency to recede from each other. Attraction\r\nis an unknown force, which causes bodies or their particles to\r\napproach each other. The particles of all bodies possess this\r\nproperty, which causes them to adhere, and preserves the various\r\nsubstances around us from falling in pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat different kinds of Attraction can you mention?\r\n\r\nAttraction may be distinguished into that which takes place between\r\nbodies at sensible distances, and that which manifests itself between\r\nthe _particles_ of matter at insensible distances.\r\n\r\n\r\nGive an example of the first kind of attraction.\r\n\r\nOne of the most familiar instances of attraction at sensible distances\r\nis seen in the descent of heavy bodies to the ground. When a stone is\r\nlifted up in the hand, the earth\'s attraction, which previously caused\r\nit to remain at its surface, is overcome; but, as soon as the hand is\r\nwithdrawn, the stone falls to the earth. The force which causes this\r\nis called the _attraction of gravitation_, or simply _gravitation_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the second kind of attraction, or that between the particles of\r\nbodies, subdivided?\r\n\r\nInto the _attraction of aggregation_, or _cohesion_; and _chemical\r\nattraction_, or _affinity_. The former takes place between particles\r\nwhich are _similar_, and the latter between those which are\r\n_dissimilar_. All the operations of chemistry are founded upon the\r\nforce of affinity which Nature has established between the particles\r\nof different kinds of matter, and which enables the chemist to produce\r\n_new_ compounds differing more or less from the substances by whose\r\nunion they were formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it, then, necessary for chemists to understand the relative nature\r\nof all substances?\r\n\r\nYes; because the basis of this science consists in an _analytical_\r\nexamination of the works of Nature; an investigation of the properties\r\nand uses of all substances we are acquainted with; and the study of\r\nthe effects of _heat_ and _mixture_, in order that we may find out\r\ntheir general and subordinate laws.\r\n\r\n     _Analytical_, relating to analysis.\r\n\r\n     _Investigation_, act of searching, or tracing out.\r\n\r\n     _Subordinate_, inferior in nature, dignity or power.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelate a few more of the advantages obtained by a knowledge of\r\nChemistry.\r\n\r\nMany of the wonderful operations of Nature, and the changes which take\r\nplace in substances around us, are, by its means, revealed to us. In\r\nevery manufacture, art, or walk of life, the chemist possesses an\r\nadvantage over his unskilled neighbor. It is necessary to the farmer\r\nand gardener, as it explains the growth of plants, the use of manures,\r\nand their proper application: and indispensable to the physician, that\r\nhe may understand the animal economy, and the _effects_ which certain\r\n_causes_ chemically produce; and the nature of animal, vegetable, and\r\nmineral poisons. The study is, therefore, an invaluable branch in the\r\neducation of youth: it is useful, not only in the active, but the\r\n_moral_ life, by laying the foundation of an ardent and inquiring\r\nmind. Even an everyday walk in the fields can be productive of\r\ninstruction, by a knowledge of it;--and let us always remember, that\r\n"Knowledge is Power."\r\n\r\n     _Indispensable_, necessary, not to be done without.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nATTRACTION, TIDES, GRAVITY, ARTESIAN WELLS, AIR, ANEROID\r\nBAROMETER, EAR-TRUMPET, STETHOSCOPE, AUDIPHONE, TELEPHONE, PHONOGRAPH,\r\nMICROPHONE, MEGAPHONE, TASIMETER, BATHOMETER, ANEMOMETER,\r\nCHRONOMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Attraction?\r\n\r\nBy attraction is meant that property or quality in the particles of\r\nbodies which makes them tend toward each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there several kinds of attraction?\r\n\r\nYes. Attraction has received different names, according to the\r\ncircumstances under which it acts: The force which keeps the particles\r\nof matter together to form bodies or masses, is called attraction of\r\n_cohesion_; that which makes bodies stick together only on their\r\nsurfaces, is called _adhesion_; that which inclines different masses\r\ntoward each other, as the earth and the heavenly bodies, is called\r\n_gravitation_; that which forces the particles of substances of\r\ndifferent kinds to unite, is known under the name of _chemical\r\nattraction_; that which causes the needle of the compass to point\r\nconstantly toward the poles of the earth, is _magnetic attraction_;\r\nthat which is excited by friction in certain substances, is known as\r\n_electrical attraction_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you know that attraction exists through the whole universe?\r\n\r\nThis great universal law was first discovered by Sir Isaac Newton. The\r\nsun and planets and other heavenly bodies are only guided in their\r\npath by gravitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo we experience this attraction upon our earth?\r\n\r\nYes; because our earth is carried around the sun by it; and, further,\r\nthe tides show it very clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the Tides?\r\n\r\nThe ebbing and flowing of the sea, which regularly takes place twice\r\nin twenty-four hours. The cause of the tides is the attraction of the\r\nsun, but chiefly of the moon, acting on the waters of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Gravity?\r\n\r\nGravity is the attraction between the earth and the bodies on the\r\nearth, which makes what we call weight of bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you understand by specific weight or gravity?\r\n\r\nIt means the weight of a body as compared with the weight of an equal\r\nbulk of some other body taken as a standard--commonly water.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do we say that certain metals--as, for example, platina or\r\ngold--are heavier than others, say, lead or iron?\r\n\r\nBecause the former have a greater specific gravity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut is not a pound of gold as heavy as a pound of lead?\r\n\r\nYes; but a lump of gold will be heavier than a lump of lead of equal\r\nbulk.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan we explain by this what we call floating?\r\n\r\nA body will float in water if its gravity is less than that of water;\r\nfor example, wood floats for this reason in water, and a balloon in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy does a portion of the floating body sink below the surface of the\r\nwater?\r\n\r\nBecause the body in order to float must displace a portion of water\r\nequal in weight to the whole floating body.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut why do iron steamers float--iron being heavier than water?\r\n\r\nBecause the steamer is not a solid piece of iron, but is hollow, and\r\nso increased in bulk; for that reason the weight of the vessel and its\r\ncontents is less than that of an equal bulk of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can you ascertain that air has weight?\r\n\r\nWe can do it by the barometer and by very many experiences in daily\r\nlife. If one end of a straw be dipped into a vessel of water and the\r\nother end be sucked, the liquid will rise to the mouth. There we see\r\nthe pressure of the outside air forces the liquid through the straw\r\nwhere the air was removed by sucking.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you show the same by another instrument?\r\n\r\nYes; the common water pump demonstrates the same as the straw. A tube\r\nis placed into the water, the air is sucked out from the tube by the\r\nmovement of the pump, and the outside air presses the water through\r\nthe tube.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Artesian wells?\r\n\r\nWells so named because they were made first at Artois, in France. They\r\nwork on the principle that every liquid seeks its level. Of the rain\r\nwhich falls, a part soaks into the soil of mountains, until, coming to\r\na layer of rocks or clay through which it cannot pass, it will collect\r\nand be stored up. If a hole be bored into this reservoir the water\r\nwill rise in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you know some other properties of air?\r\n\r\nIt is the most necessary substance for our life; it is the vehicle of\r\nall odors and smells; it is the medium of all sounds, and brings to\r\nour ear and so to our mind an immense knowledge of the outside world;\r\nit is the cause of the beauty of the blue firmament or sky, of the\r\naurora and twilight; it is the great nurse of the whole vegetable\r\nkingdom by clouds, rain, and dew.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is an Aneroid Barometer?\r\n\r\nIt is a barometer in the construction of which no quicksilver or other\r\nliquid is used. It consists of a metal box, exhausted of air, the top\r\nof which is of thin metal, so elastic that it readily yields to\r\nalterations in the pressure of the atmosphere. When the pressure\r\nincreases, the top is pressed inwards; when, on the contrary, it\r\ndecreases, the elasticity of the lid, aided by a spring, tends to move\r\nit in the opposite direction. These motions are transmitted by\r\ndelicate levers to an index which moves on a scale. This barometer has\r\nthe advantage of being portable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Ear-trumpet?\r\n\r\nA trumpet-like instrument used to aid deaf persons in hearing. Its\r\nform is conical, and the larger end is of a bell shape; the small end\r\nis placed in the ear, and the person talks in the large end. It acts\r\nby concentrating the voice on the listener\'s ear.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Stethoscope?\r\n\r\nAn instrument used by physicians for ascertaining the action of the\r\nlungs, judging by the sound of their motion whether they are healthy\r\nor not.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the Audiphone.\r\n\r\nIt is a fan-shaped instrument to help deaf people, and is made of\r\nflexible carbonized rubber. Fine silk cords attached to the upper edge\r\nbend it over, and are fastened by a wedge in a handle. The top edge of\r\nthis fan rests upon the upper teeth, and the sound waves strike its\r\nsurface; the vibrations are thus conveyed by the teeth and the bones\r\nof the face to the acoustic nerve in the ear.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the Telephone.\r\n\r\nIt is an instrument by which conversation may be carried on at a\r\ndistance, and is composed of three parts--a thin disk of soft metal, a\r\nsmall coil or bobbin of silk-covered copper wire, and a small bar\r\nmagnet about four inches long. The bobbin is placed on one pole of the\r\nmagnet, so that the wire is as it were steeped in the magnetic space\r\nround the pole. The metal disk is placed face close to the pole and\r\nbobbin, so that when it vibrates in front of the pole a series of wave\r\ncurrents will be set up in the coil of wire on the bobbin. The whole\r\nis encased in wood, and a mouth-piece is provided for speaking against\r\nthe disk. The coil of wire on the bobbin is of course connected by its\r\ntwo ends into the circuit of a telegraph line.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho invented the Telephone?\r\n\r\nIt was invented, almost simultaneously, by Alex. Graham Bell, a\r\nnative of Scotland, and Professor of Vocal Physiology in the Boston\r\nUniversity, and Elisha Gray, of Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Phonograph?\r\n\r\nIt is an instrument for recording the vibrations of sounds, and\r\nconsists of a revolving cylinder covered with tin-foil. To this\r\ncylinder is attached a mouth-piece, fitted with a thin plate or disk,\r\non the outer side of which, next to the cylinder, is a needle or\r\npoint. The cylinder runs on a screw, so that the whole length of it,\r\nfrom end to end, may pass under the point. On speaking into the\r\nmouth-piece the voice causes the disk to vibrate, and the point to\r\ntrace marks corresponding to these vibrations on the tin-foil. By\r\nturning the cylinder so that the point again passes into the marks in\r\nthe tin-foil, the sounds that entered at the mouth-piece can be\r\nreproduced at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy whom was the phonograph invented?\r\n\r\nBy Thomas A. Edison, who was born in Ohio in 1847. Mr. Edison is the\r\ninventor of many improvements in telegraphy, which have been adopted\r\ninto general use, and are to him the source of a large income. To him,\r\nalso, we are indebted for the megaphone, microphone, tasimeter, an\r\nimprovement in the telephone, a system of electric lighting, and many\r\nother inventions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Microphone?\r\n\r\nThis instrument is a variety of telephone by means of which faint\r\nsounds can be heard at a very great distance. It consists of a small\r\nbattery for generating a weak current of electricity, a telephone for\r\nthe receiving instrument, and a speaking or transmitting instrument.\r\nThe last is a small rod of gas carbon with the ends set loosely in\r\nblocks of the same material. The blocks are attached to an upright\r\nsupport, glued into a wooden base board. This instrument is connected\r\nwith the battery and the telephone. So wonderfully sensitive is it,\r\nthat the ticking of a watch, the walking of a fly across a board, or\r\nthe brush of a camel\'s-hair pencil can be heard even though it be\r\nhundreds of miles distant.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill you describe the Megaphone?\r\n\r\nIt is a substitute for the ear and speaking trumpet. It consists of\r\nthree paper funnels placed side by side. The two larger ones are about\r\n6 feet 8 inches long and 27-1/2 inches in diameter, and are each\r\nprovided with a flexible tube, the ends of which are held to the ear.\r\nThe centre funnel, which is used as a speaking-trumpet, does not\r\ndiffer materially from an ordinary trumpet, except that it is larger\r\nand has a larger bell mouth. Two persons, each provided with a\r\nmegaphone, can, without other apparatus, carry on a conversation at a\r\ndistance of one and a half or two miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Tasimeter?\r\n\r\nIt is an instrument, sensitive to the smallest degree of heat, and is\r\nmostly used in astronomy. Attached to a telescope it will show the\r\nheat coming from the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Bathometer?\r\n\r\nThis ingenious instrument, the invention of Prof. Siemens of London,\r\nenables those on board of ships to read from an index the depths of\r\nthe ocean beneath them. It consists of a highly sensitive steel spring\r\nto which a heavy piece of metal is attached. The changes in weight to\r\nwhich the latter is subject in consequence of the variations of\r\nattractive force (the deeper the ocean the smaller the latter, and\r\nvice versa) are registered on a scale by the indicator that is in\r\nconnection with the steel spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is an Anemometer?\r\n\r\nAn instrument for measuring the velocity and force of the wind, and by\r\nwhich storms, at a distance, can be predicted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Chronometer?\r\n\r\nA time-piece of delicate and exact construction, chiefly employed by\r\nastronomers and navigators. It differs only from an ordinary watch in\r\nits delicate springs, in not being so much influenced by heat and\r\ncold, and consequently in its accuracy in giving the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nLIGHT, LIME LIGHT, MAGNESIUM LIGHT, ELECTRIC LIGHT, RAINBOW,\r\nPRISM, SPECTRUM, COLORS, PHOTOGRAPHY, CAMERA OBSCURA, STEREOSCOPE,\r\nKALEIDOSCOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you know something about the nature of Light?\r\n\r\nLight is a mere form of vibration like sound, and like sound it\r\nrequires some source to set this vibration going, and some medium to\r\ncarry this vibration as air carries sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not the air this medium?\r\n\r\nNo, it is supposed that there is an elastic fluid called "ether" which\r\npervades all space and matter, and if the molecules of a body are in\r\nmotion they have the power of setting this ether in motion. The\r\nmovement thus produced will appear either as heat or light according\r\nto its velocity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat sources of light do you know?\r\n\r\nWe are told that the principal source of light on earth is the sun,\r\neither directly with its own beams or indirectly by supplying us with\r\ncombustibles to produce light; for oil, gas, candles, and most of the\r\nsubstances used for producing light and heat when burning are but\r\nsending forth in another form the rays of the sun which were stored up\r\nin nature\'s economy.\r\n\r\nAnother source of light is the result of chemical action, such as the\r\nlime, magnesium, and electric light. A third source of light is\r\nphosphorescence, as we see it in the glow-worm and fireflies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Drummond or Lime Light?\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most brilliant of artificial lights. When a stream of\r\noxygen and one of hydrogen under pressure are brought together and\r\nmixed within a few inches of the end of a blowpipe, the mixture on\r\nlighting burns with a colorless flame possessing intense heat. If this\r\nflame be made to play upon a ball of carbonate of lime, the lime on\r\nbecoming white hot gives off a powerful incandescence.\r\n\r\n     _Incandescence_, the glowing whiteness of a body caused by\r\n     intense heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Blowpipe?\r\n\r\nA tube, usually bent near the end, terminated with a finely-pointed\r\nnozzle, for blowing through the flame of a lamp or gas-jet, producing\r\nthereby a small conical flame possessing intense heat. It is used in\r\nsoldering silver, brass, etc. A mixture of oxygen and hydrogen when\r\nignited constitutes the hydrogen blowpipe, invented by Dr. Hare of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Magnesium Light?\r\n\r\nWhen the metal magnesium is rolled out into a fine ribbon and heated\r\nto red heat it burns with a dazzling light.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is the most powerful artificial light?\r\n\r\nThe so-called Electric light. This light, whether produced by a series\r\nof galvanic cells or by dynamic power, is the most brilliant and\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Rainbow?\r\n\r\nThe rainbow is that beautiful semi-circular band or arc of different\r\ncolors in the clouds during the occurrence of rain in sunshine. When\r\nthe clouds opposite the sun are very dark and rain is falling from\r\nthem, the rays of the sun are divided by the raindrops as they would\r\nbe by a prism. There are often two rainbows at the same time, because\r\nthe primary bow is again reflected to another layer of clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Prism?\r\n\r\nA triangular solid piece of glass, on which if a ray of light be cast\r\nit will be distinctly divided into the seven colors we see in a\r\nrainbow. By this fact we see that white light is composed of different\r\nrays which have different reflective susceptibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Spectrum?\r\n\r\nIt is this beautiful band of seven colors obtained by the refraction\r\nof a ray of light through the prism.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence come the colors in the objects we see in nature?\r\n\r\nThey all come from light; every object has a power to absorb certain\r\nrays and to reflect others. A red cloth, for example, absorbs all the\r\nother colored rays except red, and this it gives off, thus appearing\r\nred.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy are the leaves of plants green?\r\n\r\nBecause a peculiar chemical substance called chlorophyl, formed within\r\ntheir cells, absorbs all other rays of light, reflecting only blue and\r\nyellow--which mixture produces the different green tints.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Photography?\r\n\r\nThe word means "light drawing." It is a mode of fixing on certain\r\nsubstances the lights and shades of any object by means of a lens\r\ninserted in a camera obscura. This process was first called\r\nDaguerreotype from the name of the inventor, Daguerre. A plate of\r\ncopper thinly coated with silver is exposed to the vapor of iodine,\r\nthen placed in a camera obscura, where an image of the object to be\r\npresented through a lens is cast upon it. Ambrotype is the same\r\napplication to glass. There are now different variations of method in\r\nthe use of the same agents. Now photography consists in taking the\r\nimages on what is called a negative--that is, a glass coated with a\r\nsilvered collodion (gun-cotton dissolved in alcohol and ether) film.\r\nFrom this plate another image is taken on silvered paper, which we\r\ncall the positive image. There are also other chemicals used instead\r\nof silver.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Camera Obscura?\r\n\r\nA small box or dark room into which the light is admitted through a\r\nlens.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Stereoscope?\r\n\r\nIt is an instrument exhibiting the effects and advantages of seeing\r\nwith two eyes. The instrument is so constructed that from a flat\r\npicture we may see the solid body in its reality in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Kaleidoscope?\r\n\r\nAn instrument invented by Sir David Brewster, consisting of a tube\r\nwith slips of reflecting glass so arranged in the interior that small\r\nbeads, bits of colored glass, and similar things are, by revolving the\r\ntube, thrown into an endless variety of beautiful shapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY, ELECTRIC CURRENTS, ELECTRIC BATTERY, ELECTROTYPING,\r\nSTEREOTYPING, TELEGRAPH, OCEAN CABLE, LIGHTNING ROD, THE GULF STREAM,\r\nTHE MT. CENIS TUNNEL, THE SUEZ CANAL, SUSPENSION BRIDGES, EMINENT\r\nAMERICANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the nature of Electricity?\r\n\r\nA form of energy into which all other forms can readily be converted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is an Electric current?\r\n\r\nElectricity manifests itself in a variety of ways, but all may be\r\narranged under two heads, _viz._, 1, as a charge; 2, as a current. By\r\nmeans of friction, many bodies become electrified--that is, have\r\nacquired an electrical charge. If this charge is in great quantity we\r\ncall it high tension. When a body containing an electrical charge is\r\nbrought in contact with other bodies through which electricity is\r\ncapable of passing, there ensues a current of electricity. Such bodies\r\nare called conductors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the sources of currents?\r\n\r\nThere are currents produced by chemical action called voltaic\r\ncurrents; by the action of heat, or thermo-electric currents; by the\r\nmotion of magnets, or magneto-electric currents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMOVING THE EARTH FROM THE CANAL BY MEANS OF\r\nDROMEDARIES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPENING THE SUEZ CANAL--PROCESSION OF SHIPS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is positive and what negative electricity?\r\n\r\nNo difference in electricity in itself. When a body has more than its\r\nnatural amount of electricity, it is said to be charged positively;\r\nwhen it has less than its natural amount it is negatively charged.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Cell; what a Battery?\r\n\r\nIf a piece of zinc and copper joined by a wire be dipped in a\r\nliquid--generally weak sulphuric acid--which will act chemically on\r\nthe metals, a current is produced. Such an arrangement is called a\r\ncouple, or cell. If many cells are connected, then it is called a\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Thermo-electricity?\r\n\r\nIf two bars of any unlike metal--for example, antimony and bismuth--be\r\nsoldered together at one end, and the other ends be connected by a\r\nwire and then the soldered end heated, a current will flow.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat effects are produced by currents?\r\n\r\nThey produce heat, light, decomposition and combination in liquid\r\nchemical compounds; they melt all metals, excite magnetism, and in the\r\nanimal body excite movements of the muscles.\r\n\r\nCan you specify these effects?\r\n\r\nA strong battery produces heat in such a degree that all metals can be\r\nmelted. Light is produced in flashes, or if the end of the leading\r\nwires are connected with two pencils of hard carbon, and brought very\r\nnear together, then a brilliant light, or arc, called the voltaic arc,\r\nis produced. This is the dazzling bright light which we call electric\r\nlight. The chemical effect of a current in decomposing compound\r\nsubstances is called electrolysis. In this way water can be decomposed\r\ninto its compounds, hydrogen and oxygen; copper sulphate into sulphur\r\nand metallic copper, etc. In this way we can deposit strong adherent\r\nfilms of metal on the surface of any conductor; for if the article to\r\nbe coated be attached to the negative electrode of a battery, and\r\ndipped into a solution of the metal with which we desire to coat the\r\narticle, say copper or silver, and the positive electrode be attached\r\nto a plate of copper and also dipped into a liquid, when the current\r\npasses, the metal will be decomposed and deposited in a uniform layer\r\nover the article at the negative electrode. This process is called\r\n_electro-plating_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Electrotyping?\r\n\r\nIt is the process of copying medals, type, wood-cuts, engraved copper\r\nand steel plates, etc., by means of electrical deposition. It is\r\nchiefly used for making, from the ordinary movable types, plates of\r\nfixed metallic types, for printing books.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the process.\r\n\r\nThe article to be copied is first covered with black-lead, and then a\r\nmould is made of it in wax or gutta-percha. This mould is placed in a\r\nsolution of sulphate of copper, and attached to the negative pole of\r\nthe battery, while a plate of copper is hung from the positive pole.\r\nThe electric current decomposes the copper, which is deposited in a\r\nthin film upon the mould. This film is removed and stiffened by being\r\nbacked with metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between Electrotyping and Stereotyping?\r\n\r\nIn stereotyping, a plaster of Paris mould is taken from the types, and\r\nupon this mould melted type-metal is poured, which, when hardened,\r\nmakes a solid plate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any other method of stereotyping?\r\n\r\nYes; that known as the paper process. A uniform sheet of soft matter\r\nis formed by pasting together sheets of thin, tough tissue paper. The\r\ntypes are oiled, and the soft, moist sheet is placed on them and\r\nbeaten down with a stiff brush until it receives an impression of the\r\ntype-form. Both are then run through a press, and on being taken out\r\nthe paper is found to form a perfect mould. Into this mould the\r\ntype-metal is poured and the plate formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you tell me some magnetic effects of the current?\r\n\r\nAll conductors become magnetic during the passage of a current through\r\nthem, and thereby acquire all the properties of a magnet. There are\r\nbodies which are natural magnets, and they are called permanent\r\nmagnets. Those which become magnets only during the passage of a\r\ncurrent are called electro-magnets.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you know any application of those magnets?\r\n\r\nThey are employed in a great variety of electrical apparatus,\r\nprincipally in telegraphy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen was the first telegraph established?\r\n\r\nIt was made in 1836, being invented by Prof. Steinheil, of Munich, and\r\nadopted by the government of Bavaria. It was 12 miles long, and the\r\nsignals were made by small bells.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was the inventor of the telegraph in this country?\r\n\r\nSamuel F.B. Morse, who was born at Charlestown, Mass., April 27, 1791.\r\nHe began life as a painter, but did not give his whole attention to\r\nart--chemistry and experiments in electricity and galvanism claiming\r\nmuch of his time. He first conceived the idea of the telegraph in\r\n1832, and exhibited his invention to Congress in 1837. He struggled on\r\nwith scanty means, and was about to give up in despair when Congress\r\nappropriated $30,000 for an experimental line, which was opened on May\r\n12, 1844, between Washington and Baltimore. Prof. Morse died in 1872,\r\nbut not before he had reaped honors and fortune from his invention.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow rapidly does the electric current travel through the wires?\r\n\r\nFrom experiments made it appears to be about 15,400 miles in a second.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan more than one message be sent at the same time on the same wire?\r\n\r\nYes; it is possible now to send several messages at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Cable?\r\n\r\nIt is a telegraph wire under water. Prof. Morse, in 1842, laid a wire\r\ninsulated by a covering of hemp coated with pitch-tar and India-rubber\r\nbetween Governor\'s Island and the Battery, New York. Several attempts\r\nwere made in other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the greatest telegraphic undertaking?\r\n\r\nThat of connecting Europe with America by a submarine cable spanning\r\nthe ocean, which was commenced in 1857 and completed August 5, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo whom do we owe this grand undertaking?\r\n\r\nThis honor is entirely due to Mr. Cyrus W. Field. Mr. Field was born\r\nat Stockbridge, Mass., on November 30th, 1819. In 1853 he became\r\ninterested in ocean telegraphy, and after many reverses succeeded in\r\nlaying the first cable in August, 1858. The message sent by Queen\r\nVictoria to the President of the United States, consisting of 99\r\nwords, occupied 67 minutes in transmitting. In September of the same\r\nyear this cable ceased to work, but the energy of Field restored\r\nconfidence, and another cable was made and laid down in July, 1865,\r\nbut after 1200 miles were deposited it was lost. In 1866 another was\r\nmade and successfully laid in July. In August the lost cable was found\r\nand spliced, and carried to the western shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Dynamo-electric machine?\r\n\r\nA machine by which very powerful currents can be obtained directly\r\nfrom mechanical power. In these, by means of a steam-engine or other\r\npower, a number of coils of wire called the armature are set into\r\nrapid revolution between the poles of powerful electro-magnets. All\r\ncurrents are caused to flow from the armature in one direction by\r\nmeans of a contrivance called the commutator. Very successful machines\r\nof this sort are the Gramme machine, the Siemens, and, principally,\r\nthe so-called Brush machine. By these the electric light is now\r\ngenerally produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Lightning Rod?\r\n\r\nIt is a rod of iron placed against a building to protect it from\r\nlightning. Three or four feet of one end is in the moist ground or in\r\nwater, while several feet of the other end extend above the highest\r\npart of the building. The upper end of the rod is pointed with copper\r\nor some other metal which will not easily corrode.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy whom was it invented?\r\n\r\nBy Benjamin Franklin, and first announced by him in his "Poor\r\nRichard\'s Almanac" for 1753. Franklin was born at Boston, Mass., in\r\n1706. By his talents, prudence, and honesty he rose from humble\r\nbeginnings to be one of the foremost men of his time. He was one of\r\nthe committee of five chosen by Congress to prepare the "Declaration\r\nof Independence" which he with other patriots afterwards signed.\r\nTowards the close of the year 1776 he was sent as ambassador to the\r\nFrench Court, and remained in Europe some time. He returned home in\r\n1785, and died at Philadelphia on the 17th of April, 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Gulf Stream?\r\n\r\nIt is a warm current in the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is its origin?\r\n\r\nIt may be considered as beginning on the west coast of Africa, within\r\nthe region of the trade winds. These cause a westward flow, known as\r\nthe equatorial current. On reaching the coast of Brazil, the greater\r\nportion of this current bends northward, carrying with it the waters\r\nof the Amazon and Orinoco, and passes through the Caribbean Sea into\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. Here it is further heated, and rushes out through\r\nthe only outlet, the Straits of Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe its course.\r\n\r\nDeep and narrow, it runs by Florida with a velocity varying from two\r\nto five miles an hour, and pressed by the cold current between it and\r\nthe shore, flows parallel to the coast as far as Cape Hatteras.\r\nMeeting shoals near this point, the banks of sand extending as far as\r\nNewfoundland, it there turns abruptly to the east, and with diminished\r\nspeed and increased width, rolls onward towards the coast of Europe.\r\nBefore long it divides into two great branches--the northern and\r\nsouthern. The former extends as far as Spitzbergen; the latter,\r\nsweeping along by the Madeira and Canary Islands, returns to the\r\nequator, completing the circuit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat influence has the Gulf Stream on the climate of Europe?\r\n\r\nVarious opinions have been expressed as to this. It has been estimated\r\nthat the amount of heat arising from the stream on a winter\'s day, is\r\nsufficient to raise the atmosphere over the British Isles from the\r\nfreezing point to a summer temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow may the Gulf Stream be distinguished?\r\n\r\nIt can be distinctly traced in the ocean by its dark indigo color, its\r\ntemperature, and the swiftness of its waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is the largest tunnel in the world?\r\n\r\nThe Mt. Cenis Tunnel, or the tunnel of Col de Frejus, by both of which\r\nnames it is known. It is the longest subterranean route for commerce\r\nand travel yet constructed, being 7-1/4 miles in length. It is on the\r\ncrest of the Cottian Alps, about 16 miles south-west of the summit of\r\nMt. Cenis Pass. It was begun in 1857, and finished in 1871.\r\n\r\n     _Col_, a defile.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat other great engineering work can you mention?\r\n\r\nThe Suez Canal, a ship canal running across the Isthmus of Suez, and\r\nconnecting the Mediterranean with the Red Sea. The canal is 100 miles\r\nin length, and through it an uninterrupted communication is\r\nestablished whereby large sailing vessels and steamers may pass from\r\nsea to sea, and thus avoid the long and dangerous voyage around the\r\nCape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo whom is the world indebted for this canal?\r\n\r\nThis great work owes its inception and completion to the enterprise\r\nand indomitable energy of Ferdinand de Lesseps, who was born at\r\nVersailles, France, on the 19th November, 1805. In January, 1856, he\r\nobtained a charter from the Egyptian Government for a company to\r\nconstruct the canal, and began work in 1859. Though beset by many\r\ndifficulties, the persistent energy of De Lesseps fought its way to\r\nsuccess, and in 1869 he had the satisfaction of seeing the waters of\r\nthe Mediterranean and the Red Sea mingle in the Bitter Lakes. He has\r\nsince been engaged in many engineering projects, the latest being a\r\ncanal across the Isthmus of Panama to connect the Atlantic and Pacific\r\noceans.\r\n\r\n     _Inception_, beginning.\r\n\r\n     _Indomitable_, not to be subdued.\r\n\r\n     _Persistent_, inclined to hold firm.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Suspension Bridge?\r\n\r\nA bridge supported by wires, ropes, or chains, which usually pass over\r\nhigh piers or columns at each end, and are secured in the ground\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\r\nName some of the largest bridges of this kind.\r\n\r\nThat at Niagara, those over the Allegheny at Pittsburg and the Ohio at\r\nCincinnati, and the great East River bridge, which connects New York\r\nand Brooklyn.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho planned these bridges?\r\n\r\nJohn A. Roebling, who was born at Mulhausen, Prussia, June 12, 1806.\r\nIn 1831 he emigrated to this country, and to his genius we are\r\nindebted for the bridges above named. The reports, plans, and\r\nspecifications of the East River bridge were completed, and the work\r\nbegun, when Roebling was severely injured in the foot while directing\r\nhis work. Lockjaw succeeding amputation, he died in Brooklyn, July 22,\r\n1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what great Civil Engineer has the West given birth?\r\n\r\nJames B. Eads. Born at Lawrenceburg, Indiana, May 28, 1820, he began\r\nlife as a clerk on a Mississippi river steam-boat. In 1842 he entered\r\na firm engaged in recovering sunken property, and with such success\r\nthat he retired with a fortune in 1857. During the civil war he\r\ndevised a plan for the defence of the Western waters, and constructed\r\nseveral iron gun-boats with many novel features of his own invention.\r\nHe has since acquired reputation as projecting and constructing\r\nengineer of the Illinois and St. Louis bridge, and by building jetties\r\nat the South Pass of the Mississippi, by which the depth of the river\r\nis increased, and it is made more navigable. These jetties are\r\nprojecting dikes of brush, fascines, and stone.\r\n\r\n     _Fascines_, bundles of rods or of small sticks of wood,\r\n     bound at both ends and at intermediate points, used in\r\n     filling ditches, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nGive the names of some distinguished American inventors.\r\n\r\nEli Whitney, the inventor of the Cotton Gin, born in Westborough,\r\nMass., 1765; died 1825. Jethro Wood, the inventor of the modern\r\ncast-iron plow, born at White Creek, N.Y., 1774; died 1834. Cyrus H.\r\nMcCormick, inventor of the mowing machine, born at Walnut Grove,\r\nVirginia, in 1809.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho was the inventor of the Sewing Machine?\r\n\r\nElias Howe. He was born at Spencer, Mass., July 9, 1819. When a boy he\r\nworked in a cotton mill at Lowell, but afterwards entered a machine\r\nshop in Boston. Here he conceived the idea of the sewing machine, and\r\nafter long days of labor, part of which time he and his family lived\r\non the kindness of a friend, he completed his invention.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\r\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\r\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\ncollection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\r\n"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\r\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\r\nproperty infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\r\ncomputer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\r\nyour equipment.\r\n\r\n1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right\r\nof Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\r\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\r\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\r\nfees.

If the second copy\r\nis also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\r\nopportunities to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\r\nin paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you \'AS-IS\', WITH NO OTHER\r\nWARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\r\n\r\n1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied\r\nwarranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.\r\nIf any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the\r\nlaw of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be\r\ninterpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by\r\nthe applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any\r\nprovision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\r\n\r\n1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\r\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\r\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\r\nwith this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\r\npromotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\r\nharmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\r\nthat arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\r\nor cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nwork, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\r\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\'s web site and official\r\npage at http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n'
