Province. There are 903 urban and 5,697 rural schools, and 45.87%\r\nof the school population is in attendance at the latter schools. The\r\nvalue of Household Science as an educational and practical subject has\r\nbeen recognized, to some extent, in the urban schools of the Province\r\nbut, up to the present, little attempt has been made to give the subject\r\na place among the activities of the rural schools.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide-spread impression that it is not possible in Household\r\nScience to give any instruction that is of value without the provision\r\nof separate rooms, elaborate equipment, and specially trained teachers.\r\nWhere these conditions exist, of course, the best work can be\r\naccomplished; but, even where they cannot be realized, much may be done\r\ntoward giving definite, useful instruction in the cardinal principles of\r\nhome-making, which should be learned by every girl. There is certainly\r\nnot a single rural school where some practical work in sewing and some\r\nvaluable lessons in the care of the home may not be given. As for\r\ncookery, it is doubtful if there is a single school so small and so\r\nhelpless that it is unable to use the hot noon-day lunch as a method of\r\napproach to this branch of the subject.\r\n\r\nStudents of the physical welfare of children are rapidly coming to the\r\nconclusion that a warm mid-day meal greatly increases the efficiency of\r\nthe pupil and determines to a large extent the results of the\r\nafternoon\'s study. There are other benefits to be derived from a school\r\nlunch well prepared under proper conditions. In many communities it has\r\nbeen the means of bringing about a healthy and satisfactory co-operation\r\nbetween the school and the home, of developing a higher social life in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and of introducing into the school a Household\r\nScience course, which has proved as great a benefit to the farmer\'s wife\r\nas to his children.\r\n\r\nThis Manual deals entirely with conditions that exist in our rural\r\nschools and outlines only such plans and schemes as can be carried out,\r\neven in adverse circumstances, by alert trustees, sympathetic\r\ninspectors, and resourceful teachers.\r\n\r\nPermission has been obtained from the Bureau of Education, Washington,\r\nU.S.A., to make use of a recently issued bulletin--"Three Courses in\r\nHome-making for Rural Schools", and of various bulletins issued by State\r\nAgricultural Colleges. The freest use has been made of this material,\r\nand the permission to do so is hereby gratefully acknowledged.\r\n\r\nOnly such theory as can be readily assimilated has been given; and the\r\nteacher is advised for further information and help to consult the\r\nManuals issued by the Department of Education on _Household Management_\r\nand _Sewing_. Those who wish to become thoroughly competent and to earn\r\nthe highest Departmental grants should attend the Summer Schools\r\nprovided by the Department of Education. Under certain conditions the\r\nexpenses of teachers attending these courses are paid by the Department.\r\n\r\nNothing has been included or recommended that cannot be accomplished in\r\nthe average rural school; and trustees, teachers, and inspectors are\r\nurged to make a beginning by selecting the lessons that appeal to them\r\nas being most suitable to the districts in which their schools are\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\nBy careful planning and a wise use of the time before and after school\r\nand during recess, the regular organization of the school need not be\r\ninterfered with; and, in addition to the educational and social\r\nadvantages to be derived from undertaking this work, much benefit will\r\nresult from the increased interest taken in the school by the parents\r\nand the general public.\r\n\r\nIt is not essential that the lessons in this Manual should be taken\r\nexactly in the order given. Any other arrangement called for by the\r\npeculiar circumstances of the school is admissible.\r\n\r\nThe Inspector of Manual Training and Household Science is ready at all\r\ntimes to visit rural schools for the purpose of conferring with the\r\nPublic School Inspectors, the trustees, and the teachers regarding the\r\nintroduction of Household Science as a regular subject of the school\r\ncurriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD SCIENCE IN RURAL\r\nSCHOOLS\r\n\r\nTHREE SHORT COURSES IN HOME-MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe three brief courses in home-making outlined in this Manual have been\r\nespecially prepared for use in elementary rural schools. They are in no\r\nsense complete outlines of the subjects with which they deal; rather,\r\nthey indicate a few of the important phases of food study, sewing, and\r\nthe care of the home with which the pupil in the elementary school\r\nshould become familiar. The underlying thought for each problem should\r\nbe: "Will this help the pupils to live more useful lives, and will it\r\nlead to better conditions in their homes?"\r\n\r\nThe lessons are purposely made simple, and the plans are definitely\r\noutlined, so that even the inexperienced teacher may be able to achieve\r\na certain measure of success. The experienced teacher will find in them\r\nsuggestions that may be of value in the further development of the\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe teacher who desires to use this course will necessarily have to\r\nadapt it to her own community, and it is hoped that she may be able to\r\ndo this with but little alteration. While conditions of living and\r\nchoice of foods differ in various parts of the Province, the general\r\nprinciples of nutrition, the rules of sanitation, and the methods of\r\ncooking and serving are much the same for all.\r\n\r\nOwing to the difficulty of securing time on the programme for frequent\r\nlessons in home-making, each of the courses has been limited to twenty\r\nlessons. Some teachers may not be able to have a greater number of\r\nlessons during the school year, and they may find it well to carry the\r\nthree courses through three successive years. In other schools, where\r\nmore frequent lessons can be given, it may be well to offer all three\r\ncourses during one year. The courses in cooking and the care of the home\r\ncan be advantageously combined, as many of the problems in both are\r\nrelated. The lessons in sewing may be given on another day of the week,\r\nor it may be well to give them early in the year, to be followed, later,\r\nby the cooking lessons. Thus an opportunity will be furnished for the\r\nmaking of the cooking aprons and the hemming of the towels.\r\n\r\nIt is most desirable that periods of at least forty minutes should be\r\nprovided for all the practical lessons. Longer periods will be necessary\r\nfor some of them, such as the preparation and the serving of a meal. If\r\nno practical work is undertaken in the lesson, a forty-minute period is\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRARY ON HOME ECONOMICS FOR THE RURAL SCHOOL\r\n\r\nIn addition to the text-books recommended as sources of special\r\nreference for the rural teacher, the following books, bearing on home\r\neconomics or on methods of teaching, are suggested for the rural school\r\nlibrary. These books have been chosen with the threefold purpose of\r\nproviding references for the teachers, reading matter for the pupils,\r\nand a lending library for the parents.\r\n\r\n_Laundering._ Balderston, L.

The beauty and sacredness of an ideal home life should\r\nreceive emphasis, so that the pupils may be impressed with the\r\nimportance of conscientious work in the performance of their daily\r\nhousehold duties. They should have some insight into the sanitary,\r\neconomic, and social problems that are involved in housekeeping, so that\r\nthey may develop an increased appreciation of the importance of the\r\nhome-maker\'s work.\r\n\r\nThe two most important things to be taught are "cleanliness and order".\r\nToo much emphasis cannot be placed on the value of fresh air and\r\nsunshine and the necessity for the free use of hot water and soap. The\r\nvalue of property should also be emphasized. Economy in the purchase and\r\nhandling of house furnishings and equipment should be considered.\r\nInstruction should also be given in the care of foods and clothing and\r\nin the care and arrangement of furniture. Simple instruction in the care\r\nof babies should be given, since the older children are often\r\nresponsible, to some extent, for the care of the younger members of\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\nIn some of the lessons more subjects may be suggested than the teacher\r\nwill have time to take up in a single period. In that case it will be\r\nwell for her to choose the subject which seems most vital to the\r\nimmediate needs of the community. In many cases she may be able to give\r\nan increased number of lessons. Practice and drill in all of the\r\nprocesses involved in housewifery are essential to successful training.\r\n\r\nIf a cupboard and a table have been arranged for the use of the cooking\r\nclasses, most of the suggested work can be carried out with the school\r\nequipment. Where there is no equipment in the school and school\r\nconditions do not approximate home conditions, it may be possible to\r\nsecure permission to give the lesson after school hours in the home of\r\none of the pupils who lives nearby.\r\n\r\nIn each lesson the teacher, while giving the pupils helpful general\r\ninformation on the subject under discussion, should strive to impress on\r\nthem the importance of doing some one simple thing well.\r\n\r\nThe rural teacher who is eager to make her school-room an attractive\r\nplace may devote some time in these lessons to such problems as the\r\nhanging and the care of simple curtains, the care of indoor plants, the\r\narrangement of pictures, the planning of storage arrangements for\r\nsupplies and of cupboards for dishes, and the preparations for the\r\nserving of the school lunch.\r\n\r\nIn order to teach these lessons effectively, it is desirable to have the\r\nfollowing simple equipment on hand. Additional special equipment may be\r\nborrowed from the homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT\r\n\r\n  Broom, 1\r\n  Cloths for cleaning, 6\r\n  Dish-cloths, 2\r\n  Dish-towels, 12\r\n  Dust-brush, 1\r\n  Dust-pan, 1\r\n  Garbage can (covered), 1\r\n  Lamp, 1\r\n  Oil-can, 1\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n_Rural Hygiene._ Brewer, I.

If there is no sink in the\r\nkitchen, there will be some other place arranged for washing the dishes,\r\nprobably the kitchen table, and this must be taken into consideration\r\nwhen the furniture is placed. As most of the work is done at the stove\r\nand the table, both these must be placed where they will have a good\r\nlight, and they should be close to each other, so that but few steps are\r\nnecessary for the worker.\r\n\r\nIn furnishing the kitchen, the housekeeper will find a high stool very\r\nuseful, as it will enable her to wash dishes, prepare vegetables, and do\r\nother work while seated.\r\n\r\nAll the furniture should be kept so clean and free from dust that the\r\nkitchen will have a neat and attractive appearance. A vase of flowers or\r\na potted plant, and a washable table-cover to be used after the dishes\r\nhave been put away, will help to make this room a pleasant place for the\r\nfamily. Special attention should be given to the ventilation.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen should be thoroughly cleaned after each meal. If it has\r\nbecome dusty or disarranged, it should be put in order before the next\r\nmeal is to be prepared. While the cooking is under way, everything\r\nshould be kept in an orderly condition. As soon as the meal is\r\ncompleted, the left-over food should be covered and put away; the scraps\r\nand waste material should be gathered and disposed of; and the dishes,\r\npots, and pans should be scraped, and washed in hot, soapy water, then\r\nrinsed in clear, hot water, dried, and put away. The table should be\r\nscrubbed, the stove cleaned, the floor swept and scrubbed whenever\r\nnecessary, and everything put neatly in its place.\r\n\r\n_Care of the coal or wood range._--All spots should be removed from the\r\nrange by wiping it with old paper. If it is in bad condition, it should\r\nbe washed with soap and water. If it is oiled occasionally, blacking\r\nwill not be necessary; but if blacking is used, it should be applied\r\nwith a cloth and rubbed to a polish with a brush, just as the fire is\r\nbeing started. The ashes and soot flues back of the oven and underneath\r\nit should be cleaned out once a week.\r\n\r\n_Directions for building a fire._--To build and care for a fire in the\r\ncoal or wood range, close all the dampers, clean the grate, and remove\r\nthe ashes from the pan. Put on the covers and brush the dust off the\r\nstove. Open the creative damper and the oven damper, leaving the check\r\ndamper closed. Lay some paper, slightly crumpled into rolls, across the\r\nbase of the grate. Place small pieces of kindling wood across one\r\nanother, with the large pieces on top. Lay pieces of hardwood or a\r\nshovelful of coal on top of the kindling, building so as to admit of the\r\nfree circulation of air. If the stove is to be polished, rub it with\r\nblacking. Light the paper from below. When the fire begins to burn\r\nbriskly, add coal or wood: then add more when that kindles. When the\r\nfire is well started and blue flame is no longer seen (about ten\r\nminutes), close the oven damper. Close the creative damper when the fire\r\nis sufficiently hot. Brush the stove and the floor beneath it as soon as\r\nthe fire is started. Polish the stove. If the fire becomes too hot, open\r\nthe check damper. Fill the tea-kettle with fresh water and set it on the\r\nfront of the range.\r\n\r\n_Care of the sink, wash-basin, and garbage pail._--A neglected sink or\r\ngarbage pail may be a fruitful source of disease, in addition to\r\nattracting water-bugs and other pests. Scraps should never be left in\r\nthe sink. After washing the dishes it should be thoroughly cleaned, a\r\nbrush and scouring material being used. The nickel part may be washed\r\nwith hot soap-suds, wiped dry, and polished. Water should never be left\r\nin the wash-basin. Both the soap-dish and the wash-basin should be\r\nscoured daily. The garbage pail should be emptied and washed every day,\r\nand carefully scalded once or twice a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIt will be well to have this lesson succeed or follow a cooking lesson,\r\nfor then the pupils will have a keener interest in the problems of the\r\nkitchen. (See Twenty Lessons in Cooking, Lesson I.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nCleanliness and order are the two points to be considered in this\r\nlesson. The doing well of each simple household task and the thoughtful\r\narrangement and planning of all parts of the house should be emphasized\r\nas being of great importance to the housekeeper\'s success.\r\n\r\nBegin the lesson with a discussion of the purpose of the kitchen; then\r\ndiscuss its arrangement from the standpoint of convenience for the work\r\nthat must be done there. Emphasize the importance of having the\r\nfurniture so arranged that the work may be done quickly and easily, and\r\nthat the kitchen may be given a comfortable and attractive appearance.\r\nLet the pupils arrange the furniture in the school-room. Discuss and\r\ndemonstrate the care of the stove by the use of the school stove. Assign\r\neach pupil a time when she is to look after the stove on succeeding days\r\nand grade her on her work. Let each pupil bring a report from home as to\r\nwhat she is doing to help in the care of the home kitchen. Make a\r\nspecific assignment for home work.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions Used to Develop the Lesson\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of the kitchen?\r\n\r\nWhat are the principal articles of furniture in the kitchen?\r\n\r\nHow should we arrange these things?\r\n\r\nCan we make any general rules as to arrangements?\r\n\r\nWhy is it difficult to keep the kitchen clean?\r\n\r\nAt what times is the kitchen most apt to become disarranged?\r\n\r\nWhy is it important to keep the kitchen in good order?\r\n\r\nIn what order should the kitchen be at the time we begin the preparation\r\n  of the meal?\r\n\r\nHow should the floor be cleaned? The utensils?\r\n\r\nWhat should we do with any left-over food?\r\n\r\nHow should we take care of the stove after the meal?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II: CARE OF CUPBOARDS AND UTENSILS\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that cupboards and other places where\r\nfood is stored should be kept free from dirt and scraps of food. Ants,\r\ncockroaches, mice, and other pests infest dirty places where food is\r\nkept, and render a house unfit for human habitation. It requires\r\nconstant care and watchfulness on the part of the housewife to keep the\r\ncupboards clean. She must look over the shelves daily, wiping them off\r\nwhenever they need it, and giving them a thorough cleaning at least once\r\na week.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper should know how to care for the various utensils used\r\nand understand the simplest and best methods of keeping them clean.\r\nUtensils should never be put in the cupboards until perfectly clean and\r\ndry. Particular attention should be paid to the care of milk vessels.\r\nPans, pails, pitchers, or bottles in which milk has been kept, should be\r\nrinsed in cold water, washed in strong, clean soap-suds, rinsed in\r\nclean, boiling water, and dried in the sun. If utensils have become\r\ndiscoloured or badly coated, they should be specially scoured. If\r\nsomething has been burned in a kettle, the kettle should be cleaned by\r\nfilling with cold water, adding washing-soda, and boiling briskly for\r\nhalf an hour; after that a slight scraping ought to remove the burned\r\nportion. If the kettle is not yet clean, the process should be repeated.\r\nIf a kettle has been used directly over a wood fire and becomes\r\nblackened with soot, it should be rubbed off with a newspaper and then\r\nwith an old cloth. Kettles should be dried well before being put away.\r\nWith proper care they seldom become rusty. If an iron kettle has rusted,\r\nit should be rubbed with kerosene and ashes, then washed in strong, hot,\r\nsoda-water, rinsed in clear hot water, and dried on the stove. If a\r\nkettle is very rusty, it should be covered thoroughly with some sort of\r\ngrease, sprinkled with lime, and left overnight. In the morning it\r\nshould be washed out with hot soda-water and rinsed in clear, hot water.\r\nA new kettle is generally rusty, and should be greased thoroughly inside\r\nand out and allowed to stand for two days; then washed in hot\r\nsoda-water.\r\n\r\nBath-brick should be used for scouring iron utensils and steel knives\r\nand forks. If iron pots and frying-pans are scrubbed with a piece of\r\nbath-brick each time they are used and then washed in hot soap-suds,\r\nthey can be kept in good condition. Tinware and steel knives and forks\r\nmay be cleaned by scouring with ashes, but only fine ashes should be\r\nused on tinware. The brown stains on granite utensils should be scoured\r\noff; and this ware should be carefully handled, in order to avoid\r\nchipping. Coffee-pots and tea-pots should be cleaned daily, the grounds\r\nremoved, and the interior of the pots washed out thoroughly. The\r\ntea-kettle should be washed and dried overnight and left uncovered to\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIf school lunches are served or cooking lessons are given at the school,\r\nit will be well to use this lesson to get the cupboards in readiness. If\r\nit is impossible to do this at school, arrange to have such a lesson in\r\none of the homes outside of school hours. Be sure that the housekeeper\r\nis in sympathy with the work and is willing to co-operate.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nAssign each pupil a task in the cleaning, the scouring of the dishes,\r\nand the arrangement of the cupboard. Set a definite amount to be done\r\nand carry out the plans, leaving a clean and neatly arranged cupboard at\r\nthe end of the lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON III: CARE OF FOODS\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nSeveral important points must be borne in mind if foods are to be kept\r\nin a good condition. Most foods change easily. Vegetables and fruits\r\nlose water, wilt, and become unfit to eat. Flour and corn-meal become\r\nmouldy. Potatoes decay and sprout. Some foods, such as milk, turn sour.\r\nEggs become tainted, and fat grows rancid. With proper care in handling,\r\nstoring, and keeping, this spoiling can be prevented.\r\n\r\nThe spoiling of foods is due to the presence of micro-organisms; and if\r\nfoods are fresh and sound and kept cool and clean in every way, they\r\nwill not spoil readily, because such conditions are unfavourable to the\r\ndevelopment of the micro-organisms. On the other hand, if foods are\r\nroughly handled and bruised, decomposition will take place readily, for\r\nmicro-organisms develop in the bruised portions. Care must, therefore,\r\nbe taken to select foods wisely, handle them carefully, wash them if\r\nthey are not already clean, put them in clean receptacles, and keep them\r\nin a clean, cool place. All pots, pans, and dishes in which foods are\r\nkept or cooked should be thoroughly cleansed and rinsed well, so that no\r\nfragments stick to them which may decay and cause possible infection to\r\nthe next food that is put in. Every part of the kitchen and store-rooms\r\nshould be kept clean, dry, and well aired. Light is the best germicide\r\nand purifier known.\r\n\r\nCovered receptacles should be secured for all foods. Those that are\r\nmouse-proof and insect-proof are essential to a well-kept pantry. All\r\nbottles and cans should be neatly labelled and so arranged that each one\r\ncan be conveniently reached. The outside of the bottle or case should\r\nalways be wiped off after it has been opened and food has been removed\r\nfrom it. The shelves on which the cases are kept should be wiped off\r\nevery day. If supplies of fruit or vegetables are kept on hand, they\r\nshould be looked over frequently, and whatever shows even the slightest\r\nsuggestion of spoiling should be removed. Bread should be kept in a\r\ncovered tin box, and the box should be washed out once or twice a week\r\nand frequently scalded and aired.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIf cooking lessons are to be given, it will be well to take this lesson\r\non the care of foods in connection with the first cooking lesson, and to\r\nmake it a means of arranging for the materials that are to be kept on\r\nhand and of determining how everything is to be handled.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDevote a large part of the lesson to a discussion of the necessity for\r\ncare in the handling, storing, and keeping of foods. If facilities\r\npermit, devote a few minutes to the putting away of foods that are to be\r\nused in the next cooking lesson or in the school lunch, discussing the\r\nreasons for such care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON IV: DISPOSAL OF WASTE\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nIf the daily disposal of waste is attended to, there will be no\r\nundesirable accumulation of garbage. Scraps of food that cannot be\r\nutilized for the table should be fed to the pigs or the chickens and\r\nshould not be allowed to stand and gather flies. A covered pail or pan\r\nshould be used for holding the garbage, until final disposal is made of\r\nit. Those portions that are badly spoiled and will be of no value in\r\nfeeding the stock should be burned at once. Waste vegetable substances,\r\nif suitable, should be fed to the stock, and if not, should be buried in\r\na thin layer on the ground at some distance from the house, so that they\r\nmay enrich the soil.\r\n\r\nOld papers that are badly soiled should be burned, but all others should\r\nbe kept for use in cleaning the stove, starting the fires, etc. Empty\r\ncans should be well washed and buried, so that they will not prove a\r\nbreeding-place for flies. It is well to pierce them through the bottom\r\nimmediately after opening them, so that they will not hold water.\r\nDish-water should be emptied at some distance from the house, unless\r\nthere is a drain nearby. All receptacles that hold water should be\r\ncarefully emptied, and all depressions in the soil should be filled, in\r\norder to prevent mosquitoes from breeding. All waste water should be\r\nused on the garden.\r\n\r\n_Protection of the water supply._--Only the water from deep wells should\r\nbe used for drinking purposes, because all surface water and water in\r\nshallow wells becomes dangerous through seepage from compost, pig-pens,\r\nprivies, and other places where decayed organic matter may accumulate.\r\nIn order that the water may be kept clean, the well must be supplied\r\nwith a tight-fitting top which need not be opened and a metal pump to\r\nbring up the water. A well platform that allows the water spilled on it\r\nto run back into the well is unsafe, for any filth carried on the\r\nplatform in any way will be washed directly into it. Rats, mice, and\r\nother animals get into the well if the top is not tight, and these, in\r\naddition to being unpleasant, are liable to introduce disease germs.\r\n\r\n_Simple disinfectants._--Sunshine and fresh air are nature\'s\r\ndisinfectants and should be freely admitted to every part of the house.\r\nWindows should be left open whenever possible. The windows in the\r\nsleeping rooms should always be opened at night. The interior of the\r\nhouse should be kept perfectly dry. Decay does not easily take place in\r\ndry places. A damp cellar should be drained, and the grounds around the\r\nhouse should not be allowed to drain into the cellar. Coarse coal ashes\r\nshould be used to fill in around the house, on the walks, etc., to help\r\nin securing thorough drainage. Wood ashes may be used as a simple\r\ndisinfectant to cover decayed organic matter. Whitewash is a good\r\ndisinfectant and should be frequently used both inside and outside the\r\nhouse and on all out-buildings. Kerosene and creosote also make good\r\ndisinfectants.\r\n\r\n_Care of out-of-door closets._--The privy should be so arranged that it\r\nmay be cleaned often and all excreta disposed of in a safe way. The\r\nbuilding should be so well constructed that there will be no cracks for\r\nthe admission of flies. In a poorly constructed building, old paper can\r\nbe pasted over the cracks, to make the structure fly-proof. Dry earth,\r\nstreet dust, or lime should be frequently sprinkled over the excreta,\r\nand the seat should be closed, to prevent the entrance of flies or\r\nmosquitoes. The seat should be washed frequently, and both the seat and\r\nthe floor scrubbed at least once a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIt will be well to teach this lesson at a time when improvements are\r\nnecessary in the care of the school-house. The discussions in regard to\r\nout-of-door closets will, of course, be taken when the girls are alone\r\nwith the teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDiscuss the disposal of waste, the care of garbage, etc., in the home\r\nand the school. Talk over the care of waste from the school lunch and\r\ndiscuss methods of keeping the school in a sanitary condition. Follow\r\nthis by a general cleaning of the school-house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON V: MAKING SOAP\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\n_Home-Made Hard Soap_\r\n\r\n  6 lb. fat\r\n  1 can lye\r\n  1 pt. cold water\r\n  1 tbsp. borax\r\n\r\nMelt the fat slowly. Mix the lye and water in a bowl or kettle (do not\r\nuse a tin pan), stirring with a stick until the potash dissolves. Add\r\nthe borax and allow the mixture to cool. Cool the fat and, when it is\r\nlukewarm, add the lye, pouring it in a thin stream and stirring\r\nconstantly. Stir with a smooth stick until about as thick as honey, and\r\ncontinue stirring for ten minutes. Pour the mixture into a box and allow\r\nit to harden. Cut into pieces the desired size and leave in a cool, dry\r\nplace for ten days, to ripen before using.\r\n\r\nWhen making the soap, be careful not to spill potash or lye on the\r\nhands, as it makes a bad burn. If the hands are burned, rub them with\r\ngrease at once. Do not wet them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nSome time before this lesson is given ask the pupils to bring scraps of\r\nfat from home. See that these are in good condition, and weigh them, to\r\ndetermine the portion of the recipe that can be made. Ask one of the\r\npupils to bring sufficient borax for the recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nLet the pupils look the fat over and put it on to melt, watching it\r\ncarefully. While it is heating and cooling, discuss the process of\r\nsoap-making, the cost of materials, the care necessary in the making of\r\nsoap, and the importance of its use. Get ready the other materials, and\r\na box for moulding the soap, and let the pupils work together. After the\r\nsoap has hardened and been cut, have it put away on a shelf to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VI: SETTING AND CLEARING THE TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nThe following points must be remembered when a meal is to be served: The\r\ndining-room must be clean, well aired, sufficiently lighted, and in good\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe table must be perfectly clean and covered with a clean white cover\r\n(table-cloth, doilies, paper napkins, or oil-cloth).\r\n\r\nA vase of flowers or leaves or a small potted plant, in the centre of\r\nthe table, will help to make it attractive.\r\n\r\nThe table should be prepared with everything necessary for serving the\r\nmeal, but only those foods should be placed on it that will not be\r\nspoiled by standing. If there is danger of the food attracting flies,\r\ncover it carefully.\r\n\r\nPlates for everyone who is to partake of the meal should be arranged at\r\nequal distances from one another, and half an inch from the edge of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThe knife should be placed at the right of the plate with the cutting\r\nedge toward the plate, and one inch from the edge of the table.\r\n\r\nThe fork should be placed at the left of the plate with the tines turned\r\nup, and one inch from the edge of the table.\r\n\r\nThe spoon should be placed, bowl upward, at the right of the plate, to\r\nthe right of the knife. It should be placed one inch from the edge of\r\nthe table. Spoons and forks for serving should be placed at the right\r\nand left of the dish to be served, or in another convenient position. No\r\none should have to use the personal fork or spoon for serving.\r\n\r\nThe napkins should be folded simply and placed at the left of the fork.\r\n\r\nThe tumbler should be placed at the upper end of the knife.\r\n\r\nThe cups and saucers should be placed at the right of the plate with the\r\nhandle of the cup toward the right.\r\n\r\nThe bread-and-butter plate, if used, should be placed at the upper left\r\nhand of the fork.\r\n\r\nThe salt-cellars and pepper-shakers should be placed near the centre of\r\nthe table or at the sides, where they can be conveniently reached.\r\nIndividual salt-cellars, if used, should be placed immediately in front\r\nof the individual plate.\r\n\r\nThe chairs should be placed at the table after it is set. Care should be\r\ntaken not to put them so close to it that it will be necessary to move\r\nthem after they are occupied.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIf possible, arrange to give this lesson before Lesson VIII in the\r\nseries of "Twenty Lessons in Cooking" is given; then the emphasis in\r\nthat lesson may be put upon the food to be served, proper combinations,\r\netc., while this lesson gives the drill in the arrangement and handling\r\nof the dishes.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to give the pupils a thorough drill in table setting and\r\ntable service, since much of the pleasure derived from eating depends\r\nupon the attention paid to these processes.\r\n\r\nBe careful to see that everything necessary is on hand to set the table\r\nsimply but daintily. For class practice a small table may be set for\r\nfour. This will necessitate a table-cover, four or more dinner plates,\r\nfour bread-and-butter plates, four tumblers, four cups and saucers, four\r\nknives, four forks, four teaspoons, four napkins, a salt-cellar, a\r\npepper-shaker, a platter, one serving spoon, and one serving fork. If\r\nthese things are not already in the school, probably they can be brought\r\nfrom home by the pupils. If linen cloths are not used and cannot be\r\nafforded on the tables in the homes, the pupils should be taught to use\r\na white oil-cloth.\r\n\r\nHave a diagram made on the black-board by one of the pupils of the\r\narrangement of an individual place at the table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 1._--Arrangement of an individual place at table\r\n1. Knife 2. Spoon 3. Tumbler 4. Fork 5. Napkin\r\n6. Bread-and-butter plate 7. Dinner plate]\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe process of table setting should be demonstrated with the materials\r\nat hand, and the work should be adapted to home conditions.\r\n\r\nIf there is no available table in the school-room, the desk tops may be\r\nused for individual places.\r\n\r\nReasons for the arrangement of the table should be given--the\r\nconvenience of placing the knives and the spoons to the right, the forks\r\nto the left, the cup and saucer and the tumbler to the right, the use of\r\nthe napkin, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VII: WAITING ON TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT MATTER\r\n\r\nThe one who is to wait on table must be careful to see that everything\r\nis in readiness before the meal is announced, so that she can do her\r\nwork easily, without subjecting those at the table to unnecessary delay.\r\nShe should have water, bread, and butter (if used), hot dishes ready for\r\nthe hot foods, and dessert dishes conveniently at hand. She must see\r\nthat her hands are perfectly clean and her hair and dress in order. A\r\nclean, neat apron will always improve her appearance. The room should be\r\nclean and neatly arranged.\r\n\r\nIf the meal is to be a family one and all are to sit at the table\r\ntogether, plates will be passed from one to another as they are served:\r\nbut it will still be well to have one person appointed to wait on the\r\ntable. She should be ready to supply more bread, water, etc., when it is\r\nnecessary, and to change the plates for the dessert course. She should\r\nrise from the table quickly and quietly, in order not to disturb others,\r\nand should take her place again as soon as the necessary service has\r\nbeen rendered.\r\n\r\nThe following rules should be observed: Hold the tumblers near the\r\nbottom, being careful not to touch the upper edge. Fill only\r\nthree-quarters full.\r\n\r\nPut the butter on the table just before the meal is announced, and serve\r\nin neat, compact pieces.\r\n\r\nCut the bread in even slices, pile them neatly on a serving plate, and\r\nplace it on the table, covering it with a clean napkin or towel, if\r\nthere are flies about or there is danger of dust. If preferred, the\r\nbread may be cut at the table as required. Place the dessert dishes at\r\none end of the table or, better still, on a side table, until it is time\r\nto use them. When carrying the dishes to and from the table, be careful\r\nnot to let the fingers come in contact with the food. Learn to place the\r\nhand under the dish. In particular service a napkin is used between the\r\nhand and the dish, or a tray, if the dish is a small one. The tray\r\nshould be covered with a napkin or doily.\r\n\r\nWhen a dish is being passed, hold it at the left of the person to be\r\nserved and at a convenient height and distance. Be sure that each dish\r\nis supplied with a spoon or a fork for serving, and turn the handle of\r\nthe spoon or the fork toward the one to be served.\r\n\r\nIf a plate is to be placed in front of a person, set it down from the\r\nright. Never reach in front of others at the table.\r\n\r\nWhen a course is finished, remove the dishes containing the food first;\r\nthen the soiled plates, knives, and forks. Be careful to handle only a\r\nfew dishes at a time and not to pile them. If another course is to be\r\nserved, remove the crumbs from the table, using for the purpose a napkin\r\nand plate, or a crumb tray and brush, and brushing the crumbs lightly\r\ninto the plate. Fill the tumblers, and arrange the dishes and forks or\r\nspoons quickly for the next course.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal is over, the chairs should be moved back from the table,\r\nthe dishes neatly piled and carried to the kitchen sink, the table\r\nwiped, the crumbs brushed from the floor, and the room aired.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nLet this lesson be a continuation of the previous one, placing emphasis\r\non the method of waiting on table. The same articles will be required as\r\nwere used in the last lesson. In addition to these the pupils must be\r\ncareful to have clean aprons for this lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nHave the table set, as a review of the work of the last lesson; then\r\nhave four or six of the pupils seat themselves and go through the forms\r\nof serving one another to any simple meal upon which the class may\r\ndecide. Family meal service should be explained and demonstrated first;\r\nthen service where there is one waitress. Have the pupils, in turn, act\r\nas waitresses and serve all the others, offering and placing the food,\r\nremoving the soiled dishes, filling the tumblers, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS VIII AND IX: GENERAL CLEANING OF A ROOM\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nRooms which are in constant use should be swept and dusted every day. A\r\nthorough cleaning of each room in the house will be necessary every week\r\nor two, even though the room is swept and kept in order daily. First,\r\nall cupboards, drawers, and other receptacles in which articles collect\r\nshould be cleaned; then all large movable articles should be dusted and\r\nmoved out of the room; those that are not readily movable should be\r\ndusted and covered. The floor should be swept with the windows open; the\r\nceiling and walls should be brushed with a covered broom, and the dust\r\nallowed to settle. The floor should then be wiped with a damp cloth on\r\nthe broom.[A] The woodwork should be cleaned with a damp cloth and a\r\nsoap that is not too strong. Soda or sapolio should not be used. The\r\nfurniture should be carefully uncovered, and everything arranged in\r\nperfect order.\r\n\r\n    [A] If the floor is of unfinished-wood, it will require a\r\n    thorough scrubbing. After sweeping the floor and allowing\r\n    the dust to settle, a small portion at a time should be\r\n    scrubbed with a floor-brush and soap. When scrubbing, the\r\n    grain of the wood should be followed. The scrubbing-water\r\n    should be changed frequently. For rinsing and drying the\r\n    floor, a cloth should be wrung out of clear water.\r\n\r\nThe things that are highest should be dusted first, and care should be\r\ntaken to collect all the dust in the dust-cloth. After collecting the\r\ndust, the cloth should be shaken out-of-doors, washed thoroughly, and\r\nboiled. The dust-cloth should be dampened before using on all surfaces\r\nexcept the polished furniture and windows.\r\n\r\nSweeping should be done with short strokes and the broom should be kept\r\nclose to the floor, so that the dust will not be scattered. The corners\r\nof the room should be swept first, the dust gathered in the centre, and\r\nthen swept into the dust-pan. The dust should be burned, for it may\r\ncontain disease germs. Loose hairs and fluff should be removed from the\r\nbroom after using, and it should also be washed periodically.\r\n\r\nSmall rugs should be cleaned out-of-doors. They should be swept, beaten,\r\nand re-swept, then rolled until ready to be put on the floor. If the rug\r\nis a large one and cannot be removed, it should be wiped over with a\r\ndamp cloth, rolled, and the under side of the rug and the floor beneath\r\nit should be wiped.\r\n\r\nAfter the room has been cleaned, the windows should be arranged so that\r\na supply of fresh, clean air can come constantly into it. This is\r\nessential to every room in the house, if perfect health is to be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIt will be well to have Lesson IX given in one of the homes some day\r\nafter school hours, if possible. If that cannot be arranged, the\r\nschool-room may be utilized as the place for practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDevote Lesson VIII to a discussion of the methods of cleaning and to\r\nvarious short tasks in connection with the school-room. In Lesson IX\r\nhave the pupils go through the entire process of cleaning a room. Assign\r\nsome portion of the task to each one of them, so that all may take part\r\nin the work. Supervise the work carefully, assign home practice, and\r\nhave each pupil clean a room at home once a week for a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON X: CARE OF THE BED-ROOM\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nAs soon as one is dressed in the morning, the windows in the bed-room\r\nshould be opened wide to air the room thoroughly, and the bed-clothes\r\nshould be removed and put on chairs before the window to air. The night\r\nclothing should also be aired. The slops should be emptied, and the\r\nchamber should be washed with cold water, using a special cloth. The\r\nbasin should be washed in warm, soapy water, which should then be poured\r\ninto the chamber and used for washing it. The toilet articles should be\r\nwashed, then the basin rinsed and wiped dry. The slop jar should be\r\nwashed out thoroughly, and both the slop jar and the chamber should be\r\ncleaned frequently with chloride of lime or some other disinfectant. The\r\npitcher should be filled with fresh water, and all the articles arranged\r\nneatly on the wash-stand. If the towels are soiled, clean ones should be\r\nsupplied. The mattress should be turned and the bed made carefully; the\r\nlower sheet being tucked under the mattress all around, and the other\r\ncovers tucked in at the bottom and sides of the bed. The bed should be\r\nkept free from wrinkles and smooth in appearance, and the pillows should\r\nbe well shaken and arranged at the head of the bed. The floor should be\r\nswept, the furniture dusted, and everything put in place. The windows\r\nshould be left partly opened, so that the bed-room may be well aired.\r\nFresh air is always necessary, but especially during sleep, when the\r\nbody is repairing itself, and it is important that the room should be\r\nwell aired during the day and the windows left open at night.\r\n\r\nWhen the room is to be thoroughly cleaned, the frame of the bed should\r\nbe dusted, the mattress turned, and the bed should be made. The window\r\nshades should be dusted and rolled up. The curtains should be well\r\nshaken and covered, if one has a dust sheet. All the small articles on\r\nthe bureau, table, and shelf should be placed on the bed, and the whole\r\ncovered with a sheet. The tables, chairs, and any other movable\r\nfurniture should be dusted and placed outside the room or covered. The\r\nrugs should be rolled and cleaned out-of-doors. The room should be swept\r\nand dusted. As soon as the dust has settled, the covers should be\r\nremoved, and the furniture, rugs, and all the small articles should be\r\nrestored to their places. The shades should be adjusted, and the room\r\nleft in perfect order. The broom and everything else that has been used\r\nin the work should be cleaned and put back into their places.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIt may be possible for the teacher to give this lesson in her own\r\nbed-room or in the bed-room of one of the neighbours. If this is not\r\nfeasible, the only way to make it effective is to have the pupils report\r\neach day on the work they do at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nIllustrate each process and give the reasons for everything that is\r\ndone. Emphasize the importance of the sanitary care of the bed-room, a\r\nregular time for doing the work, and the benefit of having each member\r\nof the family care for her own personal belongings and her own portion\r\nof the bed-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XI: CARE OF LAMPS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that the teacher is acquainted with the possibilities of\r\nelectricity and other methods of better lighting in country homes, and\r\nwill instruct her pupils in the economic use of modern lighting\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\n_Directions for cleaning and filling lamps._--A bright light comes from\r\nclean burners that allow a good draught. This means constant care on the\r\npart of the one who looks after the lamps. In the daily cleaning, first\r\ndust the chimney shade and the body of the lamp. Wash the chimney. If\r\nsooty, clean with a newspaper before washing. Next, turn the wick high\r\nenough to show all the charred part; cut this off, making it perfectly\r\neven, then rub with a piece of soft paper. Wipe the burner and any other\r\npart of the lamp that may be oily. Dry with another cloth. Fill the body\r\nof the lamp with oil to within an inch of the top, leaving plenty of\r\nroom for the gas that may be generated from the kerosene, as this gas,\r\nin a lamp that has been used many times without refilling, may be a\r\nsource of danger.\r\n\r\nWhen lighting the lamp, turn the wick down, allowing the chimney to\r\nbecome heated gradually. If it is necessary to move the lighted lamp,\r\nturn the wick low. The flaring up of the flame smokes the chimney. Do\r\nnot leave a lighted lamp in a room where there is no one to watch it.\r\nWhen putting out the light, blow across the chimney, never down into it,\r\nas this might send the flame down into the kerosene.\r\n\r\nAbout once a month give the lamp a thorough cleaning. Spread out a\r\nnewspaper and take the lamp apart. Wash the chimney and the shade in hot\r\nwater, dry with a towel, and polish, using soft paper. Boil every part\r\nof the burner in water to which two tablespoonfuls of soda have been\r\nadded. Insert new wicks if the old ones are dirty, and put the parts all\r\nsecurely together again. Keep an old pan and some cloths exclusively for\r\nthis purpose, and be very careful not to allow the dirty hands or a drop\r\nof kerosene to come near any food.\r\n\r\nHave a regular time in the day for cleaning the lamps, preferably\r\nimmediately after all the morning work has been done after breakfast. Do\r\nnot fill the lamps near the kitchen stove. Do not light a match while\r\nthe oil-can is near, and never fill a lamp while it is lighted or while\r\nnear another one which is lighted. If a fire is caused by kerosene,\r\nsmother it with a heavy rug or a woollen garment, and do not attempt to\r\nput it out with water.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIt will be well to give this lesson just before some evening\r\nentertainment at the school-house. If there are no lamps at the school\r\nhave a few brought in from neighbouring homes. Secure an old pan and\r\nsome cloths to use in cleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDiscuss with the pupils the cost and properties of kerosene and the\r\ndanger of having a light or too great heat near a can of kerosene.\r\nExplain the draught by means of which the kerosene can be made to burn\r\non the wick and the danger if the burner becomes clogged up and the\r\ndraught is cut off. Have the lamps taken apart, the burners boiled, the\r\nchimneys cleaned, and the body of the lamps filled and wiped off. Then\r\nhave the lamps lighted, to see that they burn properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XII: PREVENTION OF PESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nHousehold pests are annoying, dangerous to health, and destructive to\r\nproperty. They carry disease germs from one person to another and from\r\nthe lower animals to human beings. Absolute cleanliness is essential, if\r\nthe house is to be kept free from pests. As a rule, they flourish in\r\ndark, damp, dirty places. With proper care the housekeeper can keep her\r\nhouse free from them and, if they are noticed, she should know how to\r\nexterminate them.\r\n\r\nA few simple methods of extermination are here given:\r\n\r\n_Bedbugs._--Kerosene should be poured into all the cracks, and a brush,\r\ndipped in kerosene, run briskly over all surfaces. Care must be taken to\r\nhave no fire in the room while this is being done. The windows should be\r\nopen, and the room should be kept free from dust. In four days this\r\nshould be repeated, in order to kill any bugs that may have just\r\nhatched.\r\n\r\n_Cockroaches and water-bugs._--A solution of one pound of alum to three\r\npints of water should be poured into all the cracks. Insect-powder and\r\nborax are also effective. Absolute cleanliness and freedom from dampness\r\nare necessary, if the house is to be kept free from cockroaches.\r\n\r\n_Ants._--Oil of cloves or pennyroyal on pieces of cotton-batting\r\nscattered about in the places where ants appear will drive them away.\r\nSaturating the nests with coal-oil will destroy them. Food which\r\nattracts ants should be removed from places which they are able to\r\nreach.\r\n\r\n_Rats and mice._--These are best exterminated by the use of a trap or\r\nsome preparation such as "Rough on Rats". Traps should be set nightly\r\nand should be scalded and aired after a mouse has been caught. Rat holes\r\nmay be stopped by sprinkling with chloride of lime and then filling with\r\nmortar or plaster of Paris.\r\n\r\n_Mosquitoes._--These breed in swampy places, or in old barrels or kegs\r\nor tin cans which hold stagnant water. Therefore, if the swampy places\r\nare drained and the grounds about the house are kept free from stagnant\r\nwater, the housekeeper will, as a rule, not be troubled with mosquitoes.\r\nEmpty barrels or kegs should be inverted, and old tin cans should have a\r\nhole punched in the bottom, so that they will not hold water. All high\r\nweeds near the house should be cut down and destroyed, so that they will\r\nnot provide a damp place in which to harbour mosquitoes. If it is\r\nimpossible to get rid of all standing water, the breeding of mosquitoes\r\ncan be checked by pouring kerosene oil on the water. One ounce of oil on\r\nfifteen square feet of water is sufficient, and this will have to be\r\nrenewed at least once in ten days. The doors, windows, and ventilators\r\nof the house should be well screened, as a protection against\r\nmosquitoes.\r\n\r\n_Flies._--These are one of the greatest carriers of typhoid and other\r\ngerms, as well as filth of all sorts. They can be got rid of only by\r\ndestroying the breeding places and killing the flies as rapidly as\r\npossible. Materials that attract them should not be exposed in and about\r\nthe house. The house should be well screened with wire mesh or mosquito\r\nnetting, in order to keep out the flies. A fly swatter should be kept at\r\nhand. The stables should be cleaned daily. Manure piles should be\r\nscreened, and every effort should be made to kill the larvae by frequent\r\nspraying with kerosene, creoline (dilute creosote), or lime.\r\n\r\n_Fleas._--These will be troublesome if cats or dogs are kept in the\r\nhouse. These pets should be given frequent baths, the rugs on which they\r\nlie should be brushed and shaken daily, and the floors should be washed\r\nwith soap and water and wiped with kerosene.\r\n\r\n_Moths._--These are apt to develop in woollen clothes unless the\r\ngarments are thoroughly shaken and absolutely protected by wrapping in\r\nnewspapers before being put away. Woollen garments that are used only\r\noccasionally should be kept in a light, dry place, examined frequently,\r\nand hung in the sun occasionally. Moths or carpet beetles can be\r\nexterminated by the use of kerosene.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nGive this lesson at a time when the pupils are asking about household\r\npests or when the school is suffering from them. It would be well to\r\nhave it in the spring, just before the school closes, so that the pupils\r\nmay immediately put into practice what they learn. It may be desirable\r\nto devote their efforts to the destruction of one particular pest; for\r\nexample, a fly crusade may be inaugurated.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nIf there are pests in the school-room, discuss their habits, what seems\r\nto attract them, where they come from, etc. Have the pupils report any\r\nthat they may have at home. Explain why they are dangerous, tell how\r\nthey can be exterminated, and assign to each pupil the task of\r\nexterminating one household pest. Have her report, each day, the success\r\nof her efforts. Continue this work for several weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIII: REMOVING STAINS, BLEACHING FABRICS, AND SETTING COLOURS\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nAs garments and household linens are apt to become stained and thus lose\r\ntheir attractiveness, it is well to know the remedies for the most\r\ncommon stains and the principle upon which their removal depends. All\r\nstains should be removed as soon as possible. Boiling water will loosen\r\nand remove coffee, tea, and fresh fruit stains. The stained spot should\r\nbe held over a bowl, and the water should be poured upon it with some\r\nforce. Cold water will remove stains made by blood or meat juice.\r\nSoaking will help in the removal of blood stains. Rust stains may be\r\nremoved by wetting the stained spot with lemon juice, covering it with\r\nsalt, and placing the stained fabric in the sun. Stains from stove\r\nblacking, paint, and grass may be removed by soaking in kerosene and\r\nwashing well with soap and water. Ink stains may be removed by soaking\r\nin water, removing as much of the stain as possible, and then soaking in\r\nmilk. Stains from cream and other forms of grease may be washed out in\r\ncold water, followed by warm water and soap.\r\n\r\nWhite cotton and white linen materials may be bleached by exposure to\r\nthe sunshine while still damp. If they are left out overnight, the\r\nbleaching process is made effective by the moisture furnished by dew or\r\nfrost. A stream of steam from the tea-kettle may also help in the\r\nbleaching process.\r\n\r\nSome colours are set by the addition of a small amount of acid to the\r\nfirst water in which they are soaked, while others are set by the use of\r\nsalt. It is necessary to try a small amount of the material before\r\ndipping in the entire garment, in order to be sure of satisfactory\r\nresults. Vinegar should be used for blues, one-half cup to one gallon of\r\nwater. Salt is most effective for browns, blacks, and pinks. In most\r\ncases, two cups of salt to one gallon of cold water will be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe towels used for drying dishes or the linen used for some school\r\nentertainment may have become stained with coffee, fruit, or some other\r\nsubstance. Make this the basis of a lesson, and let the pupils bring\r\nfrom home other things which are stained. Each pupil should have an\r\narticle on which to practise. This lesson should be preliminary to the\r\nlesson on laundry work.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nExamine the various articles from which stains are to be removed.\r\nDiscuss the method of removal, and let each pupil work at her own stain\r\nuntil it is as nearly removed as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIV: WASHING DISH-TOWELS, APRONS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nDish-towels should be thoroughly washed at least once a day. Wash one\r\npiece at a time (the cleanest first) in warm, soapy water and rinse in\r\nclear water in another pan. Hang in the sun, if possible, so that the\r\nair will pass through. Boil at least once a week in soapy water, to keep\r\nthem fresh and white. Sunshine and fresh air are valuable for the\r\npurposes of bleaching and purifying.\r\n\r\nWash the aprons in hot, soapy water; boil, rinse, and blue slightly. A\r\nsmall amount of thin starch may be desirable. A thin starch may be made\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n_Recipe for Thin Starch_\r\n\r\n  2 tbsp. starch\r\n  4 tbsp. cold water\r\n  1/2 tsp. lard, butter, or paraffin\r\n  1 qt. boiling water\r\n\r\nAdd the cold water to the starch and lard, stir until smooth, then add\r\nthe boiling water slowly, stirring constantly. Boil for several minutes\r\nin order to cook the starch thoroughly; then add one pint of cold water\r\nand a small amount of blueing. Dilute if necessary.\r\n\r\nHang the articles in the sun to dry, shaking well before putting on the\r\nline, and folding the edge of each over at least six inches. Be sure to\r\nhave the line clean. When dry, fold carefully. A short time before\r\nironing, sprinkle well.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable to give this lesson earlier in the course, if\r\ncooking lessons are being given and dish-towels are in use, or if the\r\naprons are badly soiled. Other articles may be washed, if time and\r\nfacilities permit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDiscuss briefly the need for laundry work and the general principles.\r\nLet the pupils take turns at washing the towels or aprons; examine each\r\narticle after it is washed, and give careful directions for the boiling,\r\nblueing, and starching. While these processes are being completed, let\r\nsome of the pupils prepare the line. Let two of them be appointed to\r\nbring the towels in, before going home from school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XV: IRONING\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nTo do good ironing it is necessary to have a firm, unwarped ironing\r\nboard. This should be covered with some thick woollen material and a\r\nwhite cotton cover that is clean, smooth, and tightly drawn. The thick\r\ncover should be tacked on, while the top cover should be pinned, so that\r\nit may be easily taken off to be washed. A heavy iron-holder should be\r\nprovided; and the irons should be clean and smooth. For this purpose\r\npaper should be kept at hand, as well as a piece of beeswax, sandpaper,\r\nor salt. A small cloth should be used to wipe the iron after using the\r\nbeeswax. A newspaper should be spread on the floor, to protect any\r\npieces that may hang down while being ironed. The coarser towels should\r\nbe ironed first, as the longer the irons are used, the smoother they\r\nbecome. Starched pieces should not be ironed until the irons are very\r\nhot. If the article is first laid smooth, it will be easier to iron it\r\nand keep it in shape, and every piece should be ironed until it is\r\nperfectly dry. As soon as the ironing is completed, the articles should\r\nbe hung up to air.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nArrange to have the ironing lesson just as soon after the laundry lesson\r\nas possible. It will probably be easy to borrow the necessary equipment\r\nfrom homes near the school. Each pupil may be directed to bring\r\nsomething that will contribute toward the equipment, and one may be\r\ninstructed to have the fire ready and another to put the irons on to\r\nheat before the lesson hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nCall the pupils together early in the morning or at some time previous\r\nto the lesson period, and give them directions for sprinkling the\r\narticles to be ironed. When the class hour comes, demonstrate the method\r\nof ironing, folding, and hanging the articles, and let the pupils take\r\nturns in doing the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS XVI AND XVII: CARE OF THE BABY\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nBecause young girls are fond of little children and must help their\r\nmothers often with their baby brothers and sisters, they should know how\r\nto care for them. It is essential that they should understand the\r\nfollowing points: The little body needs protection. The head is soft,\r\nand the brain may be injured by hard bumps or pressure. The skin is\r\ntender and is easily irritated by the bites of insects, friction, and so\r\non. Kicking and wiggling are necessary to the development of the\r\nmuscles, but the baby should not be played with all the time; and it is\r\nwell for it while awake to lie quiet for part of the time. It should not\r\nbe made to sit up until ready to do so. A desire to creep should be\r\nencouraged. Standing or walking should not be taught the baby until it\r\ntries to stand or walk itself, and then it must be helped very\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\nThe baby should have plenty of fresh air and should be allowed to spend\r\nmuch of its time out-of-doors. In cold weather it must be warmly covered\r\nand sheltered from high winds. Its eyes should always be protected from\r\nstrong sunlight.\r\n\r\nRegular hours should be observed for sleep, and the baby should be put\r\nto bed early in the evening. If the house is not well screened in\r\nsummer, a mosquito bar should be put over the crib. The clothing should\r\nbe light and loose, so that the body can move freely.\r\n\r\nPerfect cleanliness is necessary to keep the baby\'s skin in good\r\ncondition; and a daily bath should be given. A morning hour, midway\r\nbetween the meals, is usually the best time for this. The baby should be\r\ntaught to use the chamber before the bath and after the nap. Everything\r\nshould be ready before it is undressed. The room should be very warm.\r\nThe water should be only moderately warm, and should be carefully tested\r\nto make sure that it is not too hot. The towels and covers for the baby\r\nshould be at hand. The head and the feet should be washed first, and the\r\nbody soaped before putting the child into the bath. Little soap should\r\nbe used, for even the best soap is strong and is apt to irritate the\r\ndelicate skin. The bath should be given quickly, and the body wrapped at\r\nonce in a blanket or towel and kept covered as much as possible while it\r\nis being dried.\r\n\r\nThe baby should be fed in small quantities at regular intervals and\r\ngiven plenty of cold water to drink. Not until it is eleven or twelve\r\nmonths of age should it be given solid or semi-solid food. Even then,\r\nmilk should continue to form the basis of its diet, and of this a\r\nconsiderable quantity should be used--about a quart a day from the\r\ntwelfth month on. As the child grows older a more varied diet will be\r\nnecessary. The most hygienic methods of food preparation should always\r\nbe observed.\r\n\r\nCertain foods should never be given; for example, fried foods, pastries,\r\ncondiments, pickles, preserves, canned meats, fish, pork, sausage, cheap\r\ncandies, coarse vegetables, unripe and overripe fruits, stimulants,\r\nfoods treated with a preservative or colouring matter, and half-cooked\r\nstarches.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe teacher should talk with the pupils, in order to see what points in\r\nconnection with the care of the baby it is necessary for them to know,\r\nso that they may do their work at home intelligently.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nIt will probably not be possible to have anything more than a class\r\ndiscussion of the points in question, but the pupils\' home experiences\r\nought to make this discussion vital. If there is a nurse in the\r\nneighbourhood who can be secured to give one lesson on the care of the\r\nbaby, the teacher should supplement her own lessons by an additional\r\nlesson given by the nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVIII: COST OF FOOD, CLOTHING, AND HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nIt is of great importance that children should learn in an elementary\r\nway the value of property. This will prepare them for the knowledge of\r\nthe cost of living that is essential. They should learn that the cost of\r\nfood can be decreased by having gardens, and by the proper choice, care,\r\nand handling of foods; that taking care of clothing will reduce another\r\nitem of expense; and that the owning of one\'s own house and lot is\r\nsomething worth working for, in order to obviate the necessity of paying\r\nrent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe teacher will have to acquaint herself thoroughly with conditions in\r\nthe community, so that she can talk intelligently with the pupils,\r\nemphasize the right points, and give constructive help.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nBegin with a discussion of the cost of food; how much the pupils earn or\r\nspend during the week; and why it is worth while to cook and sew well\r\nand to look after property. Continue such discussions from time to time,\r\nin connection with other school work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIX: HOW TO KEEP ACCOUNTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nIt is well for every one to keep a written record of all money received\r\nand all money spent. Children should be taught to do this as soon as\r\nthey are old enough to have money in their possession. A simple little\r\nnote-book in which all expenditures are entered on the right side and\r\nall receipts on the left side, with the balance drawn up each week or\r\nmonth, will prove an easy and satisfactory method of keeping accounts.\r\nIf the little girl learns to do this with her pennies, she will be\r\nbetter able to take care of the more important household accounts when\r\nshe is in charge of a home. However, there will be no real incentive for\r\nher to keep accounts unless she is endeavouring to save for some good\r\npurpose. If she learns to save for the future purchase of a book, a\r\ndress, or some little treat, she will feel that her account-keeping is\r\nworth while. As a housekeeper, she will appreciate the importance of\r\nsaving for some future benefit to the family.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIn order to make the lesson of vital interest, introduce it at a time\r\nwhen the pupils are saving for some specific purpose--material for a\r\ndress to be made in the sewing class, refreshments for a party for their\r\nmothers, a school library, or something else that will be a pleasure and\r\nhelp in the work of the school.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the sources of income of the pupil and of her family,\r\nand the means of increasing and taking care of that income, discuss\r\nsimple methods of keeping accounts, illustrate these on the black-board,\r\nshow how to balance the accounts, and see that each pupil has a small\r\nbook suitable for the purpose. It may be necessary to make or to rule\r\nthis book as a portion of the class exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XX: CARE OF THE EXTERIOR OF THE HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the housekeeper\'s work within the home is the care of\r\nthe exterior of the house and its surroundings. It is absolutely\r\nnecessary that the grounds be kept neat and clean. In addition to this\r\nthey should be made attractive by the careful selection of a few trees\r\nand shrubs suitably placed. While the gardens at the rear of the house\r\nmay be planned solely for the pleasure and use of the family, in\r\nplanning the lawn at the sides and front the neighbours and passers-by\r\nmust be considered. The grounds should be a picture of which the house\r\nis the centre, the trees and shrubs being grouped to frame the picture.\r\n\r\nIn placing shrubs, the effect of the whole landscape should be\r\nconsidered. As a rule, shrubs should be placed in corners, to hide\r\nouthouses from view, or to screen other places which should be shielded.\r\nThe centre of the lawn should be left free, and in no case should a\r\nshrub be placed in the middle of an open space in a lawn or yard. A few\r\nflowers should be planted among the shrubs, to give colour at different\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the house must be considered, if the picture framed by\r\nthe shrubs and vines is to be a pleasing one. The house should be\r\npainted in a soft brown or dark green to blend with the landscape of\r\noaks and pines. The paint will help to preserve the house, but its\r\ncolour must be carefully chosen to give a pleasing effect.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of the grounds and local conditions in regard to soil\r\nand climate will determine to a large extent the kind of shrubs to be\r\nused. Many beautiful shrubs which have been introduced from foreign\r\ncountries do well in Ontario, but our native shrubs serve all decorative\r\npurposes. For damp ground there is no better shrub than the red osier\r\ndogwood. This shrub will do well on almost any kind of soil. The swamp\r\nbush honeysuckle grows quickly and is suitable for clay land; so are the\r\nblack elderberry and several species of viburnum. The hazel which may be\r\nobtained from the woods makes a good dense shrub, and the wild rose also\r\nhas possibilities. The common barberry is an attractive shrub; but, as\r\nit assists in the formation of wheat rust, it should not be used in\r\nrural sections. The lilac may be used where a high shrub is desirable.\r\nThe common arbor vitae or cedar of the swamps makes a good evergreen\r\nshrub. It serves well as a shield for both winter and summer and thrives\r\nwith moderate care. The weigela, forsythia, and spiraea are also\r\nexcellent shrubs.\r\n\r\nThe ground at the back of the house should be used for vegetable gardens\r\nwith flower borders. For this purpose a deep, rich soil is necessary,\r\nand every square foot of space should be utilized. Every family should\r\nlearn to make use of an increased number of vegetables and fruits and to\r\ncook them in a variety of ways. No crops should be allowed to go to\r\nwaste. A family of five people could be entirely provided with\r\nvegetables for the summer and autumn from a garden less than fifty by\r\nseventy-five feet.\r\n\r\nThe attractiveness, as well as the usefulness, of the borders depends\r\nupon the choice and arrangement of flowers. These should be chosen with\r\ndue consideration as to height of plants, colour of blooms, and seasons\r\nof blooming. The tallest plants should be placed at the back of the\r\nborder; for a border six feet wide none of the plants need be over five\r\nfeet in height. There can be a riot of colours, if the flowers are\r\narranged in clumps of four to six throughout the entire length of the\r\nborder. In a well-planned flower border some flowers should be in bloom\r\neach month. Hardy perennial flowers should predominate, with enough\r\nannuals to fill up the spaces and hide the soil. The well-tried,\r\nold-fashioned flowers will give the best satisfaction. Every four years\r\nthe flower borders need to be spaded, well manured, and replanted.\r\n\r\nThe following lists of flowers for borders may be suggestive:\r\n\r\n_Perennials._--Bleeding-heart, carnations, chrysanthemums, columbine,\r\ncoreopsis, dahlias, gaillardias, golden glow, iris, larkspur, oriental\r\npoppies, peonies, phlox, pinks, platycodon, snapdragon.\r\n\r\n_Biennials._--Forget-me-not, foxglove, Canterbury bells, hollyhock,\r\nsweet-william, wallflower.\r\n\r\n_Annuals._--African daisy, ageratum, aster, calendula, calliopsis,\r\nbalsam, candytuft, cornflower, cosmos, marigold, mignonette, nasturtium,\r\npetunia, poppy, stock, sweet alyssum, sweet-pea, verbena, zinnia, annual\r\nphlox, red sunflower, cut-and-come-again sunflower.\r\n\r\nEach home gardener should study garden literature, in order to assist in\r\nsolving the garden problems; for the day has passed when one needed only\r\nto scratch the soil with a shell, plant the seeds, and receive an\r\nabundant crop. Today successful gardening depends upon intelligent\r\nmanagement of the soil and crop and upon persistent labour.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe teacher should, if possible, visit the homes of all the pupils, in\r\norder to make herself familiar with the condition in which their grounds\r\nare kept. She may be able to secure permission from one of the\r\nhousekeepers to use her grounds as the practice place for the lesson, or\r\nit may be more desirable to give this lesson at the school and to\r\nconduct a school garden as a model home garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDiscuss the arrangement and care of the home or school grounds. Have the\r\nclass tidy the lawn and garden chosen for the lesson, supervising the\r\nwork carefully. Assign the tidying up of the home lawns or work in the\r\nhome gardens for the coming week. Let this lesson serve as a means of\r\ninteresting the pupils in home gardening, if that has not already been\r\ntaken up, or of emphasizing the relation of gardening to the\r\nhousekeeper\'s work, if they are already interested in the former.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n_Bush Fruits._ Card.

The instruction given in the lessons\r\nshould be based on this knowledge, and the possibilities for the\r\nimprovement of accepted methods of cooking should be considered. Those\r\nfoods should be used in the recipes which the pupils can afford to use\r\nat home. They should be encouraged to grow in their gardens a variety of\r\ngarden produce, and to keep chickens, pigs, and cows.\r\n\r\nElementary principles of nutrition and sanitation should be taught.\r\nSimple meals, with plain but well-cooked dishes, should be planned.\r\nVariations should be suggested, and the value of a mixed diet\r\nemphasized. Care should be taken not to waste time on points that are\r\nunrelated to the homes of the pupils, except as such points may be\r\nnecessary to raise their ideals.\r\n\r\nAll the work should be done carefully. The sanitary handling of food and\r\ncare in the storage of foods should be insisted upon. Careful attention\r\nshould be given to the dish-washing, care of the dish-towels, etc.,\r\nemphasizing the points in sanitation involved. The pupils should be\r\ndrilled faithfully in all points connected with the handling of anything\r\nthat comes in contact with the food.\r\n\r\nProper methods of sweeping and cleaning should be employed, and\r\nthoroughness must be practised in every detail of the work. Constant\r\ndrill in these processes should be given.\r\n\r\nThe order in which the lessons are to be given will be regulated, in\r\npart, by the season of the year in which they occur, the locality, the\r\nfoods obtainable, and any special local needs. However, care must be\r\ntaken that the lessons are given in proper sequence, so that the pupils\r\nmay see the relation of one to another and may appreciate the value of\r\neach. It may be necessary to combine two lessons or to give only part of\r\na lesson. In some of the lessons more recipes are suggested than can be\r\nprepared in a brief period. In every case the choice of a recipe will\r\nhave to be made by the teacher. Wherever it is possible, simple\r\nexperiments should be performed to show the composition of, and the\r\neffect of heat on, food.\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made to give a complete set of recipes; but those\r\nincluded here are chosen as illustrating the subjects to be discussed in\r\nthe lessons. The teacher who desires to make use of a greater number of\r\nrecipes will do well to supply herself with one of the text-books\r\nlisted. Level measurements should be used in the preparation of all the\r\nrecipes, and all the directions should be carefully followed.\r\n\r\nThe first few lessons are more fully outlined than the others,\r\nfurnishing suggestions for methods of procedure that may be adapted to\r\nlater lessons. The teacher should have a detailed plan for every lesson,\r\noutlining her method of work, the leading questions for the discussion,\r\nand the home assignments which she desires to make.\r\n\r\nFoods that are in common use are suggested for the lessons outlined.\r\nThere will necessarily be exceptions to their use in different\r\nlocalities. If any foods used in the homes are harmful because of the\r\nmanner in which they are prepared, the teacher should do all in her\r\npower to correct the situation, but she must, at the same time, be\r\ncareful not to be too radical. If the lessons given are not followed by\r\nhome practice, the time devoted to them will be, to all intents and\r\npurposes, wasted. Simple meal service should be introduced wherever it\r\nis possible, and as much instruction on the furnishing and the care of\r\nthe kitchen should be included as time permits.\r\n\r\nBy the time the course is completed, the pupil should be able to keep\r\nher kitchen in a sanitary condition and should have a sufficient\r\nknowledge of food values and of the processes of cooking to enable her\r\nto provide simple, wholesome meals for her family.\r\n\r\nFor the teaching of food values, it will be helpful to secure the set of\r\nsixteen food charts which may be obtained from the Superintendent of\r\nDocuments, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., price one\r\ndollar.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown later how the school luncheon may be managed with very\r\nlittle interference with the ordinary organization of the school. Where\r\ndefinite instruction is given in Household Science, a place must be\r\nprovided for it on the school time-table, as is the case with the other\r\nschool subjects. In sewing and household management lessons of forty\r\nminutes each are sufficient, and these can be arranged for at the times\r\nfound to be most convenient. If each pupil keeps her sewing in a box or\r\nbag, it may often be used as "busy work" when the pupil has finished her\r\nassigned work or while she is waiting for the teacher, who may be\r\nengaged with another class. Lessons in cookery should be, if possible,\r\nat least one hour in length, and should be given at a time when this\r\nperiod can be exceeded, if the character of the lesson renders it\r\ndesirable; for example, in those cases where the cooking is not\r\ncompleted at the expiration of the time assigned. For this reason the\r\nlast hour on Friday afternoon has proved a very suitable time. In some\r\nschools the lesson is commenced at half-past three and runs on until\r\ncompleted, and in this way only half an hour of the regular school time\r\nis taken.

Baked vegetable\r\nor fruit._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\n_Foods._--The body uses food to build and repair its tissues, to provide\r\nheat and energy, and to regulate the body processes. Foods differ from\r\none another in their composition and in their ability to assist the body\r\nin the performance of its varied functions. These differences have led\r\nto the classification of foods into five groups, which are spoken of as\r\nthe five food-stuffs or food principles.\r\n\r\n_Cooking._--While some foods can be used as they occur in nature, most\r\nof them are made more acceptable by the application of heat. Heat\r\nsoftens the structure of vegetables and fruits, makes tender the tissues\r\nof meat, prepares starch for digestion, develops the flavour in many\r\nfoods, and destroys the parasites and germs that may be present. The\r\nfive food-stuffs are differently affected by heat--some require slow\r\ncooking, others require intense heat. Hence, it is necessary to study\r\ncooking, in order that each food may be properly prepared.\r\n\r\n_The stove._--A knowledge of the construction of the stove and the\r\nmethods whereby heat is obtained is imperative if one is to be a\r\nsuccessful cook. For all stoves three things are necessary--fuel, a\r\nsupply of oxygen, and a certain degree of heat, known as the kindling\r\npoint, whereby the fire is started. The supply of oxygen is regulated by\r\ndampers and checks so arranged as to admit or cut off the draught of\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe creative dampers are doors or slides that come below the fire box.\r\nWhen open, they admit the entrance of air, increase the draught, and\r\nfacilitate combustion.\r\n\r\nThe oven damper is a flat plate which closes the opening into the\r\nchimney flue, to decrease the drawing of the draught. When the oven\r\ndamper is closed, the heat from the fire remains in the stove and passes\r\naround the oven.\r\n\r\nChecks are doors or slides higher than the fire-box, which, when open,\r\nallow the cold air to pass over the fire, retarding combustion.\r\n\r\nA stove is also provided with means for disposing of the ashes, soot,\r\nand the gases formed. All parts of the stove are so arranged that they\r\nmay be kept clean.\r\n\r\n(See Twenty Lessons in the Care of the Home. Lesson I)\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThere should be provided for this lesson (from the homes of the pupils\r\nor the school garden), some fruit or vegetable in season that can be\r\ncooked by dry heat. Each pupil may be able to bring an apple or a\r\npotato. The teacher should be sure to have an oven that can be well\r\nheated for baking and to have the fire well started before the lesson\r\nbegins, so that the oven will be ready for use.\r\n\r\nLessons in geography and nature study should be correlated with the\r\ncooking lesson, to give the pupils an opportunity to study the source of\r\nfoods and the reasons for cooking them.\r\n\r\nOne of the pupils should write the recipes on the black-board before the\r\nlesson hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Baked Apples_\r\n\r\nWash the apples, core them, and cut through the skin with a knife, so\r\nthat the apple can expand in baking without breaking the skin. Place the\r\napples in a baking-dish and fill each cavity with sugar. Cover the\r\nbottom of the dish with water one quarter of an inch deep and bake until\r\nthe apples are soft (20 to 45 minutes), basting them every 10 minutes.\r\nPlace them in a serving dish and pour the juice over them. Serve hot or\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baked Potatoes_\r\n\r\nSelect smooth potatoes of medium size, scrub carefully, and place in a\r\nbaking-pan. Bake in a hot oven from 45 minutes to one hour. When soft,\r\nbreak the skin to let the steam escape and serve at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDiscuss very briefly the food that is to be cooked and the method of\r\ncooking it. Have as many apples or potatoes baked as there are members\r\nof the class or as the baking-dish will hold.\r\n\r\nAssign tasks to special members of the class.\r\n\r\nAs quickly as possible put the vegetable or fruit in the oven to bake.\r\n\r\nWhile the baking is in process, take up a general discussion of foods\r\nand cooking and a special discussion of the food which is being used and\r\nthe method of cooking that is being employed.\r\n\r\nGive as thorough a lesson on the stove and combustion as time permits.\r\nExamine the baked article and discuss the methods of serving it, the\r\ntime for serving, and so on.\r\n\r\nUse the finished product for the school lunch or have it served daintily\r\nin the class. Encourage the pupils to bring a dish to school in order to\r\ntake the results of their work home for the family meal, if a school\r\nlunch is not served or if they do not need a lunch. Give careful\r\ndirections for washing the dishes and supervise the housework carefully.\r\n(See pages 52, 53, _Household Management._)\r\n\r\n    _Note._--It may be necessary to go on with some other\r\n    recitation before the baking is completed, in which case\r\n    one member of the class should be appointed to watch the\r\n    oven.\r\n\r\nQuestions Used to Develop the Lesson\r\n\r\nWhat food have we on hand for use to-day?\r\n\r\nDoes this food need cooking? Why?\r\n\r\nHow shall we prepare it for cooking?\r\n\r\nHow shall we prepare the oven?\r\n\r\nHow shall we care for the fire?\r\n\r\nHow long will it be necessary to cook this food?\r\n\r\n(Time the baking carefully and discuss more thoroughly at the\r\nclose of the lesson.)\r\n\r\nHow can we tell when it is cooked?\r\n\r\nHow shall we serve it?\r\n\r\nFor what meal shall we serve it?\r\n\r\nOf what value is it to the body?\r\n\r\n_Home assignment._--The pupils should prepare the baked dish at home and\r\nat the next lesson report the result of their work.\r\n\r\n    _Note._--The recipes given in this Manual are prepared for\r\n    normal times; but in every case the Regulations of the\r\n    Canada Food Board should be observed, and substitutes used\r\n    wherever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II: PREPARING AND SERVING VEGETABLES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Water and mineral matter in vegetables. How to prepare and serve\r\nuncooked vegetables--lettuce, cress, cabbage, etc. Cooking by moist\r\nheat. How to boil, season, and serve beet tops, turnip tops, cabbage,\r\nsprouts, kale, spinach, mustard, or other vegetable greens._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\n_Water._--All fluids and tissues of the body contain large quantities of\r\nwater, therefore water is regarded as one of the most important\r\nfood-stuffs required by the body. Practically all foods contain some\r\nwater. Fresh vegetables and fruits provide the body with a high\r\npercentage of water.\r\n\r\nWater is a valuable medium for cooking. As it heats, small bubbles are\r\nformed, which continually increase in number and size, but gradually\r\ndisappear. Some time before the boiling-point is reached, an occasional\r\nlarge bubble will rise to the surface and disappear. The water has then\r\nreached the simmering-point, 185\xc2\xb0, a temperature frequently made use of\r\nin cooking. When many bubbles form and break, causing a commotion on the\r\nsurface of the water, the boiling-point, 212\xc2\xb0, has been reached.\r\n\r\n_Mineral matter._--Mineral matter is a second food-stuff that is needed\r\nby the body, but the amount required is very small. If a variety of food\r\nis used, there is generally sufficient mineral matter in the diet.\r\nFruits and vegetables, especially fresh green vegetables, are\r\ncomparatively rich in mineral matter. Mineral matter builds up the bones\r\nand certain tissues, such as the hair, teeth, and nails, and regulates\r\nthe body processes by keeping the blood and digestive fluids in proper\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n_Green vegetables._--Green vegetables hold an important place in the\r\ndiet, because they contain valuable mineral matter. They also contain a\r\nhigh percentage of water and considerable cellulose. With few exceptions\r\nthey should be eaten raw, because the mineral salts, being soluble, are\r\nlost in the water in which they are cooked and because the cellulose\r\nserves its purpose best in the crisp form. Cabbage is rendered much more\r\ndifficult of digestion by cooking. Spinach, beet tops, etc., are more\r\npalatable when cooked. The delicately flavoured vegetables should be\r\nboiled in a very small amount of water, so that they need not be\r\ndrained. Thus the mineral matter will be retained when the vegetables\r\nare served.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThere should be provided for the lesson (from the homes of the pupils or\r\nthe school garden), some fresh vegetables in season; one that can be\r\ncooked by boiling and one that can be served uncooked with a simple\r\ndressing.\r\n\r\nOne of the pupils should write the recipes on the black-board before the\r\nlesson hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Fresh Green Vegetables_[A]\r\n\r\nWash the vegetables thoroughly, leaving them in cold water to crisp, if\r\nwilted. Keep cool until ready to serve, then arrange daintily, and dress\r\nwith salt, vinegar, and oil as desired, or prepare a dressing as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_Cooked Dressing_\r\n\r\n  1/2 tbsp. salt\r\n  1 tsp. mustard\r\n  1-1/2 tbsp. sugar\r\n  A few grains pepper\r\n  1/2 tbsp. flour\r\n  1 egg or yolks of 2 eggs\r\n  1-1/2 tbsp. melted butter\r\n  3/4 c. milk\r\n  1/4 c. vinegar\r\n\r\nMix the dry ingredients, add the egg slightly beaten and the butter and\r\nthe milk. Cook over boiling water until the mixture thickens. Add the\r\nvinegar, stirring constantly. Strain and cool.\r\n\r\n    Note.[A]--It may be well to omit from this lesson the\r\n    uncooked vegetable that is served in the form of a salad\r\n    and to give it at some other time. It is not well to\r\n    attempt to teach more than the pupils can master\r\n    thoroughly.\r\n\r\n_Recipe for Boiling and Seasoning Fresh Green Vegetables_\r\n\r\nWash the vegetables carefully and put them on to cook in boiling water.\r\nDelicately flavoured vegetables (spinach, celery, fresh peas, etc.) will\r\nrequire but little water, and that should be allowed to boil away at the\r\nlast. If spinach is stirred constantly, no water need be added. Starchy\r\nvegetables should be completely covered with water, and strongly\r\nflavoured vegetables (as turnips, onions, cabbage, and cauliflower)\r\nshould be cooked in water at simmering temperature.\r\n\r\nAfter the vegetables have cooked for a few minutes, salt should be\r\nadded, one teaspoonful to each quart of water. Cook the vegetable until\r\nit can be easily pierced with a fork. Let the water boil away at the\r\nlast. If it is necessary to drain, do so as soon as the vegetable is\r\ntender. Season with salt, pepper, and butter (1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8\r\nteaspoon pepper, and 1/2 tablespoon butter to each cup of vegetable).\r\n\r\n    _Note._--The water in which the vegetables are cooked\r\n    should be saved for soups and sauces, as it contains most\r\n    of the valuable mineral matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDiscuss the heating of water and apply the facts to cooking. Have the\r\npupils observe and describe the heating of water.\r\n\r\nIf a new tin sauce-pan or other bright tin vessel is at hand in which to\r\nheat the water, the changes which take place as the temperature\r\nincreases will be more readily apparent, and the pupils will enjoy\r\nwatching the process.\r\n\r\nDiscuss why one vegetable is to be cooked and another served uncooked.\r\n\r\nEmphasize the cleaning of the vegetable, its structure, composition, and\r\nthe effect of the boiling water upon it.\r\n\r\nAfter the vegetable has been put on to cook, discuss the method of\r\nseasoning or dressing the vegetable which is to be served uncooked, and\r\nhave it prepared attractively to serve on the plates. Especial emphasis\r\nshould be placed on the use and importance of fresh, green vegetables.\r\n\r\nContinue the discussion of vegetables, letting the members of the class\r\nsuggest others that may be prepared as salads or cooked in the manner\r\nbeing illustrated, and write the list on the black-board for the pupils\r\nto copy in their note-books.\r\n\r\nWhen the cooked vegetable is tender, have it drained, seasoned, and\r\nserved, and serve the uncooked vegetable at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhen ready for serving, let the pupils arrange their plates and forks\r\ncarefully, then let them all sit down except the two who pass the\r\nvegetables. Be sure that they eat carefully and daintily.\r\n\r\nEmphasize the careful washing of the dishes, etc., as on the previous\r\nday.\r\n\r\n_Questions Used to Develop the Lesson_\r\n\r\nHow shall we prepare our vegetables for serving?\r\n\r\nOf what value is hot water in cooking food?\r\n\r\nHow must the vegetable be prepared for boiling?\r\n\r\nDoes this vegetable contain any water?\r\n\r\nWill it be necessary to add any more?\r\n\r\nWill it be necessary to cover the sauce-pan?\r\n\r\nHow hot must the water be kept? How can one tell when\r\n  the water is sufficiently hot?\r\n\r\nHow can we determine when the food has cooked long enough?\r\n\r\nHow shall we serve this vegetable?\r\n\r\nHow does boiling compare with baking--\r\n\r\n  In the time needed?\r\n\r\n  In the matter of flavour?\r\n\r\n  In the amount of fuel used?\r\n\r\n  In the amount of work necessary?\r\n\r\n_Home assignment._--Practice in the boiling and the serving of\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON III: THE VALUE OF CARBOHYDRATES IN THE DIET\r\n\r\n_Potatoes as a source of carbohydrates. The choice, cost, care,\r\ncomposition, food value, and cooking of potatoes, baked squash, steamed\r\nsquash._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\n_Carbohydrates._--A third class of food-stuffs required by the body is\r\nknown as the carbohydrates, or sugars and starches. This class of foods\r\nis used as fuel, for the production of heat and energy in the body.\r\nExcess of carbohydrates may be stored in the body as fatty tissue.\r\n\r\n_Potatoes._--Potatoes are a cheap source of carbohydrates. They are also\r\nvaluable for their mineral matter and for the large quantity of water\r\nwhich they contain. Three fourths of the potato is water. The framework\r\nof the potato is cellulose, which is an indigestible carbohydrate\r\nmaterial. Potatoes have only a small amount of cellulose, however, and\r\nthey are comparatively easy of digestion. When dry and mealy, they are\r\nmost digestible. When used for a meal, potatoes should be supplemented\r\nby some muscle-building food, such as milk, cheese, eggs, fish, or meat.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nAt some previous period the teacher should have discussed with the\r\npupils the use of potatoes and learned from them the different ways in\r\nwhich they cook them in their homes. She should determine upon some\r\nrecipes for the lesson that will increase the variety of ways in which\r\npotatoes may be served and that will improve the methods used in the\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nEach pupil should be asked to bring one or two potatoes for the lesson.\r\nThe best methods of cooking and the means of securing variety should be\r\nemphasized.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Mashed Potatoes_\r\n\r\n  6 potatoes\r\n  1/4 c. hot milk or cream\r\n  1 tbsp. butter\r\n  1 tsp. salt\r\n\r\nWash and pare the potatoes, boil, drain, dry, and mash (with a potato\r\nmasher) in the sauce-pan in which they were cooked. Beat them until very\r\nlight and creamy; add hot milk, butter, and salt, and beat again,\r\nre-heat, and serve. Serves six to eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Browned Potatoes_\r\n\r\nWash, scrub, and pare potatoes of a uniform size. Parboil for 10\r\nminutes, then put in a dripping-pan with the meat or on a rack in a\r\nbaking-pan.\r\n\r\nBaste with fat every 10 minutes, when the meat is basted.\r\n\r\nAllow about 40 minutes for the potatoes to cook.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT TO SHOW THE PRESENCE OF STARCH IN POTATOES\r\n\r\nScrub and pare a potato. Examine a thin cross-section.\r\n\r\nGrate the potato. Remove the coarse, shredded portion. Examine.\r\n\r\nExamine the liquid and note any sediment.\r\n\r\nHeat the liquid and stir until boiling. How has it changed?\r\n\r\nExamine the portion of the grater. How has the colour changed? Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baked Squash_\r\n\r\nWipe the shell of the squash, cut it into pieces for serving, remove the\r\nseeds and stringy portion, place in a dripping-pan, and bake in a slow\r\noven for three quarters of an hour (until tender). Serve at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Steamed Squash_\r\n\r\nPrepare the squash as for baking, put in a steamer over boiling water,\r\nand cook for 30 minutes or until soft. Then scrape the squash from the\r\nshell, mash, and season with butter, salt, and pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDiscuss the composition and structure of the potato. Read over and\r\ndiscuss the recipes that are to be used.\r\n\r\nMake assignments of work. After the potatoes have been put on to cook,\r\nhave the class examine a raw potato, following the directions given.[A]\r\n\r\n    [A] Squash is another vegetable containing a high\r\n    percentage of carbohydrate. The recipe for squash can be\r\n    used at this time or in some other lesson.\r\n\r\nIf one of the recipes requires the use of the oven, be careful to have\r\nthe potatoes for it prepared first and as quickly as possible. It may be\r\nnecessary to proceed with another class, assigning one pupil to take\r\ncharge of the baking. Special attention should be given to the careful\r\nserving of the potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Home assignment._--Before the next lesson, each pupil should be able to\r\nreport that she has cooked potatoes at home, using the recipes learned\r\nin class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON IV: FRUITS AND VEGETABLES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Food value and use of fruits. Reasons and rules for canning. How to can\r\nand use such vegetables as beets, beans, tomatoes, and carrots, and such\r\nfruits as figs, grapes, apples, and peaches. The drying of fruits and\r\nvegetables._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nFruits impart palatability and flavour to other foods and exercise a\r\nfavourable influence upon the digestive organs, though their food\r\nvalue is low. They contain a high percentage of water and only a small\r\npercentage of nutrients. Most fruits are eaten raw and are exceedingly\r\nvaluable to the body because of the fresh acids they contain. Cooking\r\nsoftens the cellulose of the fruit and, therefore, renders some fruits\r\nmore easy of digestion. The cooking of fruit is of value chiefly for the\r\npurpose of preservation.\r\n\r\n_The drying of fruits._--Fruits are dried so that they may be preserved\r\nfor use. Bacteria and moulds, which cause the decay of fruits, need\r\nmoisture for development and growth. If the moisture is evaporated, the\r\nfruits will keep almost indefinitely. Fruits and vegetables can be\r\neasily and inexpensively dried. When dried fruits are to be used for the\r\ntable, they must be washed thoroughly and soaked for several hours, or\r\novernight, in water, so as to restore to them as much water as possible.\r\nThey should be cooked, until soft, in the same water in which they are\r\nsoaked.\r\n\r\n_Canning and preserving._--Other methods of preservation are desirable,\r\nin order that vegetables and fruits be made of value for a longer period\r\nof time than through their ripening season. Canning is one of the\r\nmethods most commonly employed in the home, being both easy and\r\nsatisfactory. Fruit which is to be canned is first sterilized by boiling\r\nor steaming, in order to destroy all germs and spores. This can be\r\nadequately accomplished by boiling for twenty minutes, but a shorter\r\ntime is sometimes sufficient. In order to ensure complete success, all\r\ngerms must also be destroyed on the cans and on everything which comes\r\nin contact with the food. This will be effected by boiling or steaming\r\nfor twenty minutes. The jars, covers, dipper, and funnel should all be\r\nplaced in cold water, heated until the water comes to the\r\nboiling-point, boiled five minutes, and left in the water until just\r\nbefore sealing. As for the rubbers, it will be sufficient to dip them\r\ninto the boiling water. After the fruit has been put into the can, it\r\nmust be sealed so that it is perfectly air-tight. In order to do this,\r\nit is necessary to have good covers, with new, pliable rubbers, and to\r\nsee to it that they fit tightly.\r\n\r\nWhen the jar is to be filled, it should be placed on a board or wooden\r\ntable, or on a cloth wrung out of hot water, and should be filled to\r\noverflowing.\r\n\r\nSugar is not essential to sterilization and is used only to improve the\r\nflavour. Both fruits and vegetables can be canned without sugar.\r\nHowever, fruits canned with a large amount of sugar do not spoil\r\nreadily, for germs develop slowly in a thick syrup.\r\n\r\n_Methods of canning._--The simplest method of canning is the\r\n"Open-kettle Method" employed for small, watery fruits, such as berries,\r\ngrapes, tomatoes, etc. The fruit is boiled in an open kettle (which\r\npermits of the evaporation of some of the water in the fruit) and\r\ntransferred at once to a sterilized jar, which is immediately sealed.\r\n\r\nAnother and safer method, which secures more complete sterilization\r\nwithout serious change of flavour in the fruit, is that known as the\r\n"Cold-pack Method". After being transferred to the cans, the vegetable\r\nor fruit is subjected to an additional period of heating of considerable\r\nlength, or to three periods of briefer length on three successive days.\r\nIf the three periods of sterilization are used, the process is known as\r\nthe "Intermittent Method".\r\n\r\nThe Single Process Method is described in the recipe for canned beets.\r\nThe Intermittent Process proves more satisfactory for canned beans.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe teacher should ascertain what fruits and vegetables are most\r\nabundant and select for canning those that the class can provide.\r\n\r\nEach pupil should be asked to bring some vegetable or fruit, some\r\ngranulated sugar, and a jar in which to can her fruit. If the school\r\ndoes not possess enough kettles or sauce-pans in which to do the\r\ncooking, they may be borrowed from the homes.\r\n\r\nOnly one fruit or one vegetable should be taken up at a time, for the\r\npreparation necessarily varies slightly, and the different methods will\r\nprove confusing. It is not necessary to confine the choice of fruits and\r\nvegetables to those mentioned in the recipes included here. The teacher\r\nwill find it better to base her instruction on the products of the\r\nparticular time and place. The principles of canning should be taken up\r\nat some other period, if possible, in order that the cooking lesson may\r\nbe devoted entirely to the practical work.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Canned Tomatoes_\r\n\r\n(Open-kettle Method)\r\n\r\nScald and peel the tomatoes. Boil gently for 20 minutes. Sterilize the\r\njars, covers, and rubbers. Stand the jars on a cloth in a pan of hot\r\nwater or on a board or wooden table. Fill the jars with hot tomatoes,\r\nbeing careful to fill to overflowing and to expel all air bubbles from\r\nthe jar. Adjust the rubbers and covers. Seal and allow to cool. Test,\r\nlabel, and set away in a cool, dry, dark place.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Cold-pack Method)\r\n\r\nScald in water hot enough to loosen the skins. Plunge quickly in cold\r\nwater and remove the skins. Pack whole or in pieces in the jars. Fill\r\nthe jars with tomatoes only. Add 1 level teaspoonful of salt to each\r\nquart. Place the rubber and cover in position. Partially seal, but not\r\ntightly. Place the jars on a rack in a boiler. Pour sufficient warm\r\nwater into the boiler to come half-way up the jars. Place the filled\r\njars on the rack so as not to touch one another, and pack the spaces\r\nbetween them with cotton, to prevent the jars striking when the water\r\nboils. Sterilize for 22 minutes after the water begins to boil. Remove\r\nthe jars from the boiler. Tighten the covers. Invert to cool, and test\r\nthe joints. Wrap the jars in paper to prevent bleaching and store in a\r\ncool, dry, dark place. This method of cooking is also called "The Hot\r\nWater Bath".\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canned Grapes_\r\n\r\n(Open-kettle Method)\r\n\r\n  6 qt. grapes\r\n  1 qt. sugar\r\n  1/2 c. water\r\n\r\nPick over, wash, drain, and remove the stems from the grapes. Separate\r\nthe pulp from the skins. Cook the pulp 5 minutes and then rub through a\r\nsieve that is fine enough to hold back the seeds. Put the water, skins,\r\nand pulp into the preserving kettle and heat slowly to the\r\nboiling-point. Skim the fruit and then add the sugar. Boil 15 minutes.\r\nPut into jars as directed.\r\n\r\nSweet grapes may be canned with less sugar; very sour grapes will\r\nrequire more sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canned Peaches_\r\n\r\nChoose firm, solid fruit. Scald long enough to loosen the skins. Peel\r\nand cut in halves. If clingstone peaches are used, they may be canned\r\nwhole. Pack the fruit into sterilized jars, fill with boiling syrup (1\r\nc. sugar to 1-1/2 c. water). Then put on the covers loosely and place on\r\nwooden racks in the boiler. Sterilize in hot water bath for 20 minutes.\r\nRemove the jars and tighten the covers. Invert to cool, and test the\r\njoints. Wrap the jars in paper to prevent bleaching; then store.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canned Beets_\r\n\r\n(Single Process)\r\n\r\nWash the beets and boil them until they are nearly tender and the skins\r\ncome off easily. Remove the skins and carefully pack the beets in a jar.\r\nCover with boiling water, to which one tablespoonful of salt is added\r\nfor each quart, and put the cover on the jar, but do not fasten it down.\r\nPlace the jar on a rack or a folded cloth in a large kettle that can be\r\nclosely covered. Pour enough water into the kettle to reach within two\r\ninches of the top of the jar, cover the kettle, bring the water to the\r\nboiling-point, and boil from one and one-half to two hours. As the water\r\naround the jar boils down, replenish with boiling water, never with\r\ncold. Remove the jars and tighten the covers. Invert to cool, and test\r\nthe joints. Wrap the jars in paper to prevent bleaching; then store.\r\n\r\n    _Note._--In canning beets, if vinegar is added to the\r\n    water in the proportion of one part vinegar to four parts\r\n    water, the natural bright colour will be retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canned String Beans and Peas_\r\n\r\n(Intermittent Method)\r\n\r\nCan on the same day that the vegetables are picked. Blanch in boiling\r\nwater from 2 to 5 minutes. Remove, and plunge into cold water. Pack in\r\nsterilized jars. Add boiling water to fill the crevices. Add 1 level\r\nteaspoonful of salt to each quart. Place rubbers and covers in position.\r\n\r\nSet the jars on the rack in the boiler and bring gradually to boiling\r\nheat. At the end of an hour\'s boiling, remove the jars from the boiler.\r\nTighten the clamps or rims and set the jars aside to cool until the\r\nfollowing day. Do not let the vegetables cool off in the boiler, as this\r\nresults in over-cooking. On the second day, loosen the clamps or unscrew\r\nthe rims, place the jars in warm water, heat again to boiling\r\ntemperature, and boil for an hour; then remove them again. On the third\r\nday, repeat the hour\'s boiling, as on the preceding day.\r\n\r\nCorn may be canned successfully in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dried Corn_\r\n\r\nPick the corn early in the morning. Immediately husk, silk, and cut the\r\ncorn from the cob. Spread in a very thin layer on a board, cover with\r\nmosquito netting which is kept sufficiently elevated so that it will not\r\ncome in contact with the corn, place in the hot sun, and leave all day.\r\nBefore the dew begins to fall, take it into the house and place in an\r\noven that is slightly warm. Leave in the oven overnight and place out in\r\nthe sun again the next day. Repeat this process until absolutely dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_String Beans_\r\n\r\nString beans are hung up to dry and kept for winter use.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nIf possible, let each pupil can a jar of vegetables or fruit for her own\r\nhome. If the class is large, let the pupils work in groups of two or\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nBegin the lesson with a very brief discussion of how to prepare fruit\r\nfor canning.\r\n\r\nLet the pupils proceed with the practical work as quickly as possible.\r\nDemonstrate the method of filling and sealing the jars.\r\n\r\nAssign the care of the jars and the intermittent canning on succeeding\r\ndays to members of the class, and hold them responsible for the\r\ncompletion of the work.\r\n\r\nThe drying of some vegetables can be undertaken at school, and carefully\r\nfollowed from day to day. It will furnish the pupils with an interesting\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON V: FATS--VEGETABLES--Continued\r\n\r\n_Preparation of white sauce to serve with vegetables. How to boil,\r\nseason, and serve such vegetables as lima or butter beans, string beans,\r\nonions, cabbage, corn, beets, turnips, or carrots._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\n_Fats._--Butter belongs to the class of food-stuffs known as fats. It\r\nincreases the fuel value of those dishes to which it is added.\r\n\r\nFats supply heat and energy to the body in a concentrated form. For this\r\nreason they should be used in a limited quantity. Fats undergo several\r\nchanges during the process of digestion, and the excessive use of them\r\ninterferes with the digestion of other foods and throws a large amount\r\nof work upon the digestive organs. Cooked fats are more difficult of\r\ndigestion than uncooked fats, and other foods cooked with hot fat are\r\nrendered more difficult to digest.\r\n\r\n_Vegetables._--Vegetables should be used when in season, as they are\r\nalways best and cheapest then. They are better kept in a cold, dry, and\r\ndark place.\r\n\r\nIf the vegetables contain starch or tough cellulose, they will require\r\ncooking; as raw starch is indigestible, and the harsh cellulose may be\r\ntoo irritating to the digestive tract.\r\n\r\nIn old or exceedingly large vegetables the cellulose may be very tough;\r\nhence a long period of cooking is necessary. They should be cooked only\r\nuntil they are tender. Longer cooking may destroy the flavour, render\r\nthe vegetables difficult of digestion, and cause the colour to change.\r\nIn very young vegetables the cellulose is delicate and, if young\r\nvegetables do not contain much starch, they may be eaten raw.\r\n\r\nWhen cooked vegetables are served, they are usually seasoned and dressed\r\nwith butter (for one cup of vegetables use 1/2 teaspoonful of salt, 1/8\r\nteaspoonful of pepper, and 1/2 tablespoonful of fat), or a sauce is\r\nprepared to serve with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIt may be well to have a preliminary lesson devoted to simple\r\nexperiments with flour, liquid, and fat, in order to determine the best\r\nmethod of combining the ingredients in the white sauce. However, if the\r\nlesson period is of sufficient length, a few of these experiments may be\r\nperformed in connection with it.\r\n\r\nThere should be provided for the lesson some vegetable that is improved\r\nby serving with white sauce, and sufficient milk, butter or other fat,\r\nflour, and salt for the sauce and the experiments. Discuss with the\r\npupils the fat that is used in their homes, in order to know what is\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThe recipes should be written on the black-board before the lesson hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Stewed Onions_\r\n\r\n  1 qt. onions\r\n  White pepper\r\n  2 tbsp. butter\r\n  1/4 tsp. salt\r\n\r\nPeel the onions under cold water. Cover with boiling water, add salt,\r\nand simmer until tender. Drain and serve with one cup of white sauce; or\r\nomit the sauce and serve seasoned with butter and pepper. Serves six.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cabbage_\r\n\r\nCut the cabbage into quarters and soak one-half hour in cold salt water\r\nto draw out any insects. Chop or shred, cover with boiling water, add\r\nsalt, and simmer until tender. Drain, and serve with butter, salt, and\r\npepper, or with a sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carrots_\r\n\r\nScrape the carrots and cut them into large dice or slices. Add boiling\r\nwater and boil until tender (from 30 to 45 minutes). Drain, and season\r\nwith butter, salt, and pepper, or serve with white sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n_String Beans_\r\n\r\nString the beans, if necessary, and cut into pieces. Boil in salted\r\nwater until tender. Season with butter, salt, and pepper, and serve hot.\r\n\r\nSalt pork may be boiled with the beans, to give them an added flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS IN USING STARCH FOR THICKENING\r\n\r\n(Any powdered starch may be used)\r\n\r\n1. Boil 1/4 cup of water in a small sauce-pan. While boiling, stir into\r\nit 1/2 tsp. of cornstarch and let it boil one minute. Observe the\r\nresult. Break open a lump and examine it.\r\n\r\n2. Mix 1 tsp. of cornstarch with 2 tsp. of cold water and stir into 1/4\r\ncup of boiling water. Note the result.\r\n\r\n3. Mix 1 tsp. of cornstarch with 2 tsp. of sugar and stir into 1/4 cup\r\nof boiling water. Note the result.\r\n\r\n4. Mix 1 tsp. of cornstarch with 2 tsp. of melted fat in a small\r\nsauce-pan and stir into it 1/4 cup of boiling water. Note the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS BASED ON THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n1. Starch granules must be separated before being used to thicken a\r\nliquid:\r\n\r\n  (1) By adding a double quantity of cold liquid,\r\n  (2) By adding a double quantity of sugar,\r\n  (3) By adding a double quantity of melted fat.\r\n\r\n2. The liquid which is being thickened must be constantly stirred, to\r\ndistribute evenly the starch grains until they are cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White Sauce_\r\n\r\n  2 tbsp. butter or other fat\r\n  2 tbsp. flour\r\n  1 c. milk\r\n  1/4 tsp. salt\r\n  1/8 tsp. pepper\r\n\r\n(Sufficient for 1 pint vegetables)\r\n\r\nMelt the butter, add the flour, and stir over the fire until frothy. Add\r\nthe milk and stir constantly until it thickens. Stir in the seasonings.\r\n\r\n    _Note._--Vegetable water may be substituted for part of\r\n    the milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nReview the facts on boiling vegetables learned in the previous lesson.\r\nLet the pupils put water on to boil and prepare a vegetable for cooking.\r\nIf experiments are to be made, they can be performed while the vegetable\r\nis cooking. If the experiments have been made previously, they can be\r\nreviewed in discussion at this time. Prepare a white sauce by\r\ndemonstration, using the method which seems most practical. Have the\r\nvegetables drained, dried, and added to the white sauce. When\r\nwell-heated, serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions Used to Develop the Lesson\r\n\r\nWhat facts regarding the boiling of vegetables did we learn in the last\r\nlesson?\r\n\r\nDoes the vegetable that we are to cook to-day differ in any marked way\r\nfrom those we cooked before? Should we follow the same rule in cooking\r\nit?\r\n\r\nShould we add the flour directly to the cold milk? To the hot milk?\r\n\r\nHow shall we combine the white sauce?\r\n\r\nWith what other vegetables can white sauce be used?\r\n\r\n_Home assignment._--Each pupil should prepare some vegetable and serve\r\nit with white sauce, before the next lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VI: CEREALS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kinds, composition, care, and general rules for cooking cereals.\r\nOatmeal, cracked wheat, corn-meal porridge, rice. Fruits to serve with\r\ncereals--stewed prunes, stewed apples, or apple sauce._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nThe term "cereals" is applied to the cultivated grasses--rice, wheat,\r\ncorn, rye, oats, and buckwheat. They are widely grown throughout the\r\ntemperate zone and are prepared in various forms for use as food.\r\nCereals contain a high percentage of starch and a low percentage of\r\nwater, with varying proportions of mineral matter and fat. In addition\r\nto the four food-stuffs already studied, cereals contain a small amount\r\nof another food-stuff known as protein--a muscle-building material. For\r\nthe most part, the cereals contain a large amount of cellulose, which is\r\nbroken up during the process of preparation for market and requires long\r\ncooking before being ready for use by the body. The digestibility of the\r\ncereals depends upon the amount of cellulose which they contain and the\r\nthoroughness of the cooking. Cereals are palatable, and they are\r\nvaluable, because in cooking they can be blended in various ways with\r\nother substances. They are beneficial also to the body, because their\r\ncellulose acts mechanically on the digestive organs by stimulating them\r\nto action. Cereals are made more attractive by serving with fresh or\r\ncooked fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe cereals should be discussed in a nature study or geography lesson,\r\nand two or three kinds that are in common use should be brought from\r\nhome by the pupils. If cereals are not generally used as breakfast\r\nfoods, the lesson may be a means of introducing them. Some pupils should\r\nbring a little milk and sugar, to serve with the cooked cereal. Apples\r\nor prunes should be brought, to cook and serve with the cereal.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Oatmeal_\r\n\r\n  3 c. boiling water\r\n  3/4 c. oatmeal\r\n  3/4 tsp. salt\r\n\r\nAdd the oatmeal slowly to boiling salted water.\r\n\r\nBoil for 10 minutes, stirring constantly, then cook slowly, preferably\r\nover water, at least one and one-half hours longer; the flavour is\r\ndeveloped by longer cooking. Serves six.\r\n\r\n_Cracked Wheat_\r\n\r\nFollow the recipe for oatmeal, using 3/4 c. of cracked wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corn-meal Porridge_\r\n\r\n  4 c. boiling water\r\n  3/4 c. corn-meal\r\n  1 tsp. salt\r\n\r\nAdd the corn-meal slowly to boiling salted water.\r\n\r\nBoil for 10 minutes, stirring constantly, then cook slowly for three\r\nhours longer, preferably over water. Serves six to eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boiled Rice_\r\n\r\n  3 qt. boiling water\r\n  1 c. rice\r\n  2 tsp. salt\r\n\r\nPick the rice over carefully and wash thoroughly. Add it to the boiling\r\nsalted water so gradually that it will not stop boiling. Partly cover\r\nand cook for 20 minutes, or until the grains are soft; turn into a\r\ncolander, and pour cold water through it, drain, dry, and re-heat in a\r\nhot oven with door open. Serve hot as a vegetable or as a simple dessert\r\nwith cream and sugar. Serves six to eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stewed Prunes_\r\n\r\n  1/2 lb. prunes\r\n  1 qt. cold water\r\n\r\nWash the prunes in two or three waters; then soak them in cold water for\r\nseveral hours. Heat them in the water in which they are soaked and\r\nsimmer until tender (an hour or more). Serves six to eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stewed Apples_\r\n\r\n  10 small apples\r\n  1/2 c. sugar\r\n  3/4 c. water\r\n\r\nCook the sugar and water together until it boils.\r\n\r\nWash, pare, and cut the apples into quarters; core, and slice the\r\nquarters lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices; put the apple slices into\r\nboiling syrup and cook slowly until tender. Remove from the syrup at\r\nonce and let the syrup boil down to thicken.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apple Sauce_\r\n\r\n  10 small apples\r\n  1/2 c. sugar\r\n  3/4 c. water\r\n\r\nWipe, quarter, core, and pare sour apples; add the water and cook until\r\nthe apples begin to soften; add the sugar and flavouring, cook until the\r\napples are very soft, then press through a strainer and beat well.\r\nServes eight to ten.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nAs soon as the class meets, discuss the recipes briefly and put the\r\ncereals on to cook at once. Prepare the fruit. While the long cooking of\r\nthe cereal is in progress, discuss the composition, food value, and\r\nmethods of using cereals. Then go on with another lesson and call the\r\nclass together, for serving, later in the day. Serve the fruit and the\r\ncereals together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VII: CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS--Reviewed\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nThose foods which build up and repair the muscular tissues of the body\r\nare called protein foods, muscle builders, or flesh formers. Meat, fish,\r\neggs, cheese, milk, cereals, legumes, and nuts are classed as protein\r\nfoods.\r\n\r\nThose foods which serve solely as fuel for the body--providing heat and\r\nenergy--are classed under two groups: the carbohydrates (sugar and\r\nstarches), which the body is able to use in relatively large quantities;\r\nand the fats, which the body cannot use in such large quantities, but\r\nwhich yield a large amount of heat and energy. Protein also serves as\r\nfuel, though tissue building is regarded as its special function. Sugars\r\nand starches are abundant in fruits and vegetables. Fats are found in\r\nmeats, fish, milk, and in some vegetable foods. Heat-giving food may be\r\nstored in the body as fatty tissue.\r\n\r\nMineral compounds must be present in our food, to help in the regulation\r\nof the body processes and to enter into the composition of the structure\r\nand the fluids of the body. Mineral compounds are best supplied by fresh\r\ngreen vegetables, fruits, and milk.\r\n\r\nWater is absolutely essential to the body, is present in large\r\nquantities in many foods, and is combined with many other foods during\r\nthe processes of cooking.\r\n\r\nOne or more of the food-stuffs sometimes predominate in a single food.\r\nFor example, rice is almost entirely carbohydrate, and butter is almost\r\npure fat. Occasionally, we find a food that contains all the five groups\r\nof food principles. Milk is an example of such a food, containing all\r\nfive food principles in such proportions as to supply all the\r\nnourishment which a baby needs during the early months of its life. As\r\nthe child grows older, foods rich in both carbohydrates must be added to\r\nthe diet. Wheat contains all that the body needs for nourishment except\r\nwater, which is easily added in cooking.\r\n\r\n  _Protein foods_      _Carbohydrate foods_\r\n\r\n  Meats                Sugar\r\n  Fish                 Honey\r\n  Poultry              Syrup\r\n  Eggs                 Vegetables:\r\n  Cheese                 Potatoes\r\n  Milk                   Parsnips\r\n  Cereals:               Peas\r\n    Wheat                Beets\r\n    Oatmeal              Carrots\r\n    Rye                Cereal preparations:\r\n  Legumes:               Meals\r\n    Peas                 Flours, etc.\r\n    Beans              Fruits\r\n    Lentils            Prepared foods:\r\n    Peanuts              Bread\r\n    Nuts                 Crackers\r\n                         Macaroni\r\n                         Jellies\r\n                         Dried fruits\r\n                         Candy\r\n                       Milk\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Fat foods_          _Mineral foods_\r\n\r\n  Cream                Fruits\r\n  Butter               Vegetables:\r\n  Lard                   Spinach\r\n  Suet                   Tomatoes\r\n  Fat meats              Onions\r\n  Fish                   Turnip tops\r\n  Salad oil              Cauliflower\r\n  Nuts                 Cereals:\r\n  Chocolate              Grits and other coarse preparations\r\n                       Milk\r\n                       Eggs\r\n\r\n_Choice of food._--The diet must be carefully chosen, to give a needed\r\nvariety and to combine the foods properly so that one may have a right\r\nproportion of all the food-stuffs. Each meal should contain some protein\r\nfood, some fats or carbohydrates, some mineral matter, and water. All\r\nfive forms of food-stuffs should have a place in the day\'s diet. The\r\ngreater part of the water which the body needs should be taken between\r\nmeals.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nReview the foods discussed in the previous lessons and sum up the\r\nclassification of foods, being sure that the pupils can name common\r\nexamples of each. Discuss simple combinations for the different meals,\r\nusing dishes already prepared in the course and creating an interest in\r\nother recipes to be prepared in succeeding lessons.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK-BOARD SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThere are five food principles:\r\n\r\n1. _Water_--builds and repairs the tissues, regulates the system--\r\n\r\nfound in all food-stuffs.\r\n\r\n2. _Mineral matter_--builds and repairs the tissues, regulates the\r\nsystem--\r\n\r\nfound in vegetables, fruits, cereal, and so on.\r\n\r\n3. _Carbohydrates_--give heat and energy to the body--\r\n\r\nfound in sugar and starches.\r\n\r\n4. _Fats_--give heat and energy to the body--\r\n\r\nfound in cream, nuts, pork, and so on.\r\n\r\n5. Protein--builds and repairs the tissues--\r\n\r\nfound in meat, eggs, cheese, seeds.\r\n\r\nAlways choose a diet carefully:\r\n\r\n1. To give variety.\r\n\r\n2. To combine the foods properly, so that they will contain adequate\r\nproportions of each food-stuff at every meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VIII: THE PLANNING AND SERVING OF MEALS\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that some foods are more acceptable at one time of\r\nday than other foods, and that certain combinations are more pleasing\r\nthan others. The choice of foods will also depend upon the season of the\r\nyear. For example, breakfast is, as a rule, made up of simple foods that\r\nare not highly seasoned nor subjected to elaborate methods of cooking. A\r\nfruit, a cereal, and bread, with, possibly, eggs or meat, are served at\r\nbreakfast. A hot beverage is added by most people to this meal.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, dinner consists of a hot meat or other protein dish, with\r\none or two vegetables. Soup, salad, and a sweet dessert are often\r\nserved. The soup is served before the meat course, and the salad and\r\ndessert follow it. The dessert may be a fruit, a cookie or other pastry,\r\na pudding, or a frozen dish.\r\n\r\nLunch or supper may be a very simple meal, consisting of a soup with\r\ncrackers, one protein dish (eggs, milk, or meat) with bread and stewed\r\nfruit, or a salad, with a simple dessert.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES OF WELL-CHOSEN MENUS\r\n\r\n_Breakfast_\r\n\r\nNo. I   Apple sauce\r\n        Sausage or bacon\r\n        Oatmeal\r\n        Toast\r\n\r\nNo. II  Baked apples\r\n        Eggs in the shell\r\n        Cracked wheat\r\n        Corn muffins\r\n\r\nNo. III Stewed figs or berries\r\n        Poached eggs\r\n        Corn-meal porridge\r\n        Toast\r\n\r\n    Note.--Eggs should be omitted from the breakfast menu if\r\n    they are not cheap and easily obtainable.\r\n\r\n_Dinner_\r\n\r\nNo. I    Pork chops\r\n         Potatoes\r\n         Fried apples\r\n         Mashed turnips\r\n         Bread\r\n         Rice pudding\r\n\r\nNo. II   Beef or mutton stew\r\n         Biscuits\r\n         Spinach or turnip tops\r\n         Cornstarch pudding\r\n\r\nNo. III  Baked beans\r\n         Grape sauce\r\n         Cabbage salad\r\n         Bread or biscuits\r\n\r\n_Supper_\r\n\r\nNo. I Stewed apricots or other fruit\r\n      Whole wheat bread\r\n      Buttermilk or sweet milk\r\n      Peanut cookies\r\n\r\nNo. II Omelet\r\n       Creamed potatoes\r\n       Bread\r\n       Fresh fruit\r\n\r\nNo. III Cream of carrot soup\r\n        Biscuits\r\n        Cottage cheese\r\n        Syrup\r\n\r\nThe table should always be neatly set, with individual places arranged\r\nfor each one who is to partake of the meal. Each place should be wide\r\nenough for a plate, with a knife and spoon at the right and a fork at\r\nthe left side. A tumbler should be placed at the point of the knife and\r\na napkin at the left of the fork. Everything on the table should be\r\nperfectly clean, the napkin should be neatly folded, and all the\r\narticles should be uniformly arranged, in order to give a neat\r\nappearance to the table. A flower or plant in the centre will add to its\r\nattractiveness. Salt, pepper, sugar, vinegar, and anything of the kind\r\nthat may be needed with the meal should be arranged where it can be\r\neasily reached. Fresh water should be poured into the tumblers just\r\nbefore the meal is served. The bread, butter, and so on, may be put on\r\nthe table several minutes before the meal is announced, but the hot\r\ndishes should be placed immediately before the family is seated.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIf Lesson VI, entitled "Setting and Clearing the Table" as outlined in\r\nthe course on the Care of the Home has been given, this lesson may be\r\ndevoted to what to serve and how to serve it, or it may precede the\r\nlesson on "Waiting on Table". The manner of serving may be demonstrated\r\nin the next lesson, in connection with the course on the Care of the\r\nHome.\r\n\r\nSimple equipment for family service will be required, if the form of\r\nserving is to be taken up. For class practice, a table for four may be\r\narranged. This will necessitate a table-cover, four dinner plates, four\r\nbread-and-butter plates, four tumblers, four cups and saucers, four\r\nknives, four forks, four teaspoons, four napkins, a platter, one serving\r\nspoon, and one serving fork.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDiscuss meal service from the standpoint both of choice and combination\r\nof foods and of the method of service. Let the class plan a meal, then\r\ngo through the form of serving that meal at table. In the absence of a\r\ntable, the top of a desk may be used. Later in the course, the teacher\r\nshould plan to combine this lesson with one on cooking and have the food\r\nserved. In each cooking lesson, suggestions for serving the food should\r\nbe made, and each dish cooked should be carefully served. Interest in\r\nthis lesson may be increased by allowing the pupils to make original\r\nmenus, and, if they are having some lessons in drawing, simple menu\r\ncards may be planned and executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON IX: MILK\r\n\r\n_Care, cost, and food value of milk. Value and use of sour milk--cottage\r\ncheese, curdled milk. Rice or cornstarch pudding (plain, caramel, or\r\nchocolate)._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nMilk contains all the food-stuffs which the body requires, except\r\nstarch, and, therefore, is capable of sustaining life for comparatively\r\nlong periods. It is one of the most important protein foods; but it\r\ncontains so small a percentage of carbohydrate (milk sugar) that for the\r\nadult it must be supplemented with carbohydrate foods. For the baby,\r\nmilk is a perfect food, and it is a valuable adjunct to the diet of all\r\nchildren. One quart of milk should be allowed for the diet of each child\r\ndaily, after the twelfth month; and the diet of the adult should be\r\nsupplemented by the use of milk. The greatest care should be exercised\r\nin protecting milk from dust and dirt, for it is easily contaminated and\r\nmay be the means of carrying disease germs to the body. The changes\r\nwhich milk undergoes when souring do not render it harmful. For many\r\npeople buttermilk is more easy of digestion than sweet milk, because of\r\nthe changes produced by souring, as well as the absence of fat. Sour\r\nmilk is of value in cooking, producing a tender bread which can readily\r\nbe made light by the addition of soda--one teaspoonful of soda to one\r\npint of sour milk that has curdled.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of cheese, the whey is separated from the curds, thus\r\nextracting most of the water, sugar, and mineral matter, and leaving a\r\nsubstance rich in protein and fat. Cheese is of value in cooking, for it\r\nincreases the food value of those foods to which it is added.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe teacher should make inquiries a few days in advance, to be sure that\r\none quart of sour milk can be secured, and, when it is brought, she\r\nshould examine it to see that it is in proper condition to make cottage\r\ncheese. She should arrange to have about one quart of sweet milk and\r\nsuch other supplies as are necessary for the pudding, brought by the\r\npupils.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity may be afforded to discuss the use of left-over cereal by\r\nthe preparation of a rice pudding, if the teacher provides some cold\r\ncooked rice for the lesson. In the absence of cold rice, the cornstarch\r\npudding may be prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Cottage Cheese_\r\n\r\nHeat sour milk slowly until the whey rises to the top, pour the whey\r\noff, put the curd in a bag, and let it drip for six hours without\r\nsqueezing. Put the curd into a bowl and break into fine pieces with a\r\nwooden spoon; season with salt and mix into a paste with a little cream\r\nor butter. Mould into balls, if desired, and keep in a cold place. (It\r\nis best when fresh.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rice Pudding_\r\n\r\n  1/2 c. rice\r\n  2 c. milk\r\n  2 eggs\r\n  1/3 c. sugar\r\n  1/8 tsp. salt\r\n  1/2 tsp. vanilla\r\n\r\nScald the milk in a double boiler. Add the prepared rice and cook until\r\nsoft. Beat the egg-yolks, sugar, and salt together until well mixed.\r\nStir into the rice and cook for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and\r\nserve cold. Serves eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cornstarch Pudding_\r\n\r\n  1/4 c. sugar\r\n  5 tbsp. cornstarch, or 1/2 c. flour\r\n  1 tsp. vanilla, or other flavouring\r\n  3 c. milk\r\n  1 egg\r\n\r\nMix the sugar and cornstarch thoroughly. Add one cup of cold milk and\r\nstir until smooth. Heat the remainder of the milk in a double boiler;\r\nadd the cornstarch mixture slowly, stirring constantly until it begins\r\nto thicken. Continue cooking for 20 minutes. Beat the egg well, add the\r\nhot pudding slowly, strain, and cool. Serve with milk or cream and\r\nsugar. (The egg may be omitted, if desired.) Serves eight.\r\n\r\nFor chocolate cornstarch pudding, use 1/4 cup of sugar additional\r\nand two squares of chocolate. Melt the chocolate carefully,\r\nadd the sugar, and add to the cornstarch mixture.\r\n\r\nFor caramel cornstarch pudding, use 1 cup of brown sugar\r\nand 1/2 cup of boiling water. Heat the sugar until it becomes a\r\nlight-brown liquid, add the boiling water, and stir until the\r\nsugar is all dissolved. Let it cool; then add to the cornstarch\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nAs soon as the class meets, demonstrate the method of making cottage\r\ncheese. Show the separation of curd and whey, by adding vinegar or lemon\r\njuice to sweet milk. While the cheese is draining, make assignments of\r\nwork and have the rice or cornstarch pudding made.\r\n\r\nIn this lesson and in those following emphasize the use of protein\r\nfoods.\r\n\r\nDiscuss also the food value of skimmed milk and sour milk and the\r\npurposes for which these may be used in cooking.\r\n\r\nUse the cottage cheese and the pudding for the school lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON X: SOUPS\r\n\r\n_Cream soups. Cream of carrot, potato, or onion soup, green pea soup.\r\nToast, croutons, or crisp crackers to serve with soup._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\n_Cream soups._--The strained pulp of cooked vegetables or legumes, with\r\nan equal portion of thin white sauce, is the basis for cream soups. The\r\nliquid for the soup may be all milk, part vegetable water and part milk,\r\nor all vegetable water.\r\n\r\nA binding of flour is used to prevent a separation of the thicker and\r\nthe thinner parts of the soup. This is combined as for white sauce and\r\nis stirred into the hot liquid just before the soup is to be served. The\r\nsoup should be made in a double boiler and kept in this utensil until it\r\nis served.\r\n\r\nFour tablespoons of flour to each quart of soup is a good proportion to\r\nuse for thickening all vegetable soups that are not of a starchy nature;\r\nhalf that amount will be sufficient for soup prepared from a very\r\nstarchy vegetable.\r\n\r\nThe value of the vegetable water should be impressed upon the pupils,\r\nand it should be pointed out that these soups are an excellent way of\r\nusing the cooking water and any left-over vegetables. From these,\r\nattractive cream soups may be prepared, and a combination of flavours\r\noften gives good results.\r\n\r\n_Accompaniments._--Crisp crackers, croutons, soup sticks, or bread\r\nsticks are served with cream soups, and are valuable because they\r\nnecessitate thorough mastication, thus inducing the flow of saliva and\r\naiding in the digestion of the starchy ingredients of the soups.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nAs a basis for the soup, the teacher should secure a vegetable that the\r\npupils use in their own homes, and crackers or bread to serve with the\r\nsoup.\r\n\r\nIf dried peas are used, they should be allowed to soak overnight and be\r\nput on to cook early in the morning.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to have the cooking of the carrots begun before the\r\nlesson period. If the carrots are cut up in small pieces, they will cook\r\nmore quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Cream of Carrot Soup_\r\n\r\n  1 c. cooked carrots\r\n  2 c. vegetable water\r\n  2 c. milk\r\n  4 tbsp. flour\r\n  2 tbsp. butter\r\n  Salt and pepper to taste\r\n\r\nPress the vegetables through a sieve or chop finely; put the vegetable\r\nwater on to heat. Mix the flour smoothly with an equal measure of milk\r\nand thin it with a little more of the milk. Stir into the steaming\r\nliquid, stirring constantly until it thickens. Stir in the butter,\r\nvegetable pulp, and remaining milk. Season to taste and serve hot.\r\nServes six.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cream of Potato Soup_\r\n\r\n  1 pt. milk or milk and water\r\n  2 tsp. chopped onions\r\n  3 potatoes\r\n  1 tbsp. butter\r\n  1 tbsp. flour\r\n  1 tsp. salt\r\n  1/8 tsp. pepper\r\n  2 tsp. chopped parsley\r\n\r\nPut the milk to heat in a double boiler. Boil the potatoes and onion\r\ntogether until soft, then rub the liquid and pulp through a strainer\r\ninto the hot milk. Bind with the flour, add the seasonings, and serve\r\nhot. Serves four.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pea Soup_\r\n\r\n  1 c. split peas\r\n  2-1/2 qt. water\r\n  2 tbsp. chopped onion\r\n  3 tbsp. butter\r\n  3 tbsp. flour\r\n  1-1/2 tsp. salt\r\n  1/8 tsp. pepper\r\n  1 pt. milk\r\n\r\nWash the peas and soak them overnight in cold water, drain and rinse\r\nthoroughly, add 2-1/2 quarts of cold water and the onion, cook slowly\r\nuntil soft, rub the liquid and pulp through a strainer, and bind with\r\nthe flour. Add the milk and the seasonings and serve hot. Serves six to\r\neight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Toast_\r\n\r\nCut stale bread into slices one quarter of an inch thick; put on the\r\ntoaster or fork, move gently over the heat until dry, then brown by\r\nplacing near the heat, turning constantly. Bread may be dried in the\r\noven before toasting. Hot milk may be poured over dry toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Croutons_\r\n\r\nCut stale bread into one-half-inch cubes and brown in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crisp Crackers_\r\n\r\nPut the crackers into the oven for a few minutes, or split and butter\r\nthick crackers, and brown in a hot oven; serve with soup.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDevote a few minutes to a discussion of cream soups and a review of the\r\ncooking of vegetables and white sauce.\r\n\r\nDivide the work among the members of the class, assigning enough to each\r\npupil to keep her busy, arranging the work so that the soup and its\r\naccompaniments will be ready for serving at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XI: EGGS\r\n\r\n_Food value and general rules for cooking eggs. Cooked in shell,\r\npoached, scrambled, and omelet._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nEggs are a very valuable food, because of the large amount of protein\r\nand fat they contain. Though lacking in carbohydrates, they furnish\r\nmaterial for building up the muscles and provide heat and energy to the\r\nbody. If cooked at a low temperature, eggs are very easily and very\r\ncompletely digested. Combined with other foods, they serve as a\r\nthickening agent (for sauces and soups) and as a means of making batters\r\nlight (popovers and sponge cake). They add flavour and colour and\r\nincrease the nutritive value of other foods.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe lesson on eggs furnishes one of the best opportunities to teach the\r\nmuscle-building foods. If eggs are scarce, it may be well to give this\r\nlesson at some other time. Each pupil should be asked to bring an egg;\r\none or two should bring a little milk; and sufficient bread should be\r\nprovided to toast for the poached eggs. The teacher should not undertake\r\nto give too many recipes in this lesson, but should try to make the\r\npupils familiar with a sufficient variety of ways of using eggs to make\r\negg cookery interesting. The necessity of having a moderate temperature\r\nfor the cooking of eggs should be emphasized.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Soft-cooked Eggs_\r\n\r\nPut the eggs in boiling water sufficient to cover them, remove from the\r\nfire, cover, and allow them to stand from 5 to 8 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hard-cooked Eggs_\r\n\r\nPut the eggs in cold water, heat, and, when the water boils, reduce the\r\nheat, and let them stand for 20 minutes with water just below the\r\nboiling-point, then put them into cold water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poached Eggs_\r\n\r\nBreak each egg into a saucer carefully, slip the egg into boiling water,\r\ndecrease the heat, and cook for 5 minutes, or until the white is firm\r\nand a film has formed over the yolk. Take up with a skimmer, drain, trim\r\noff the rough edges, and serve on slices of toast. Season.\r\n\r\nPoached eggs are attractive when covered with white sauce to which\r\nchopped parsley has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baked Eggs_\r\n\r\nLine a buttered baking-dish with buttered bread crumbs or with cold\r\nmashed potatoes. Break the eggs in the dish without separating and add\r\none tablespoon of milk or cream for each egg. Season with salt and\r\npepper and sprinkle with grated cheese, if desired. Bake in a moderate\r\noven until the eggs are set.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Creamed Eggs_\r\n\r\n  3 hard-boiled eggs\r\n  6 slices toast\r\n  1 c. medium white sauce\r\n\r\nPrepare a white sauce. Add hard-boiled eggs cut in halves, sliced, or\r\nchopped and, when hot, serve on toast.\r\n\r\nOr separate the whites and yolks, chop the whites fine, add to the white\r\nsauce and, when hot, serve on toast and garnish with yolks run through a\r\nsieve or ricer. Season with salt and pepper. Serves four to six.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Creamy Omelet_\r\n\r\n  1 egg\r\n  1/4 tsp. salt\r\n  Pepper\r\n  1/2 tsp. butter\r\n  1 tbsp. milk\r\n\r\nBeat the egg slightly, add the milk and seasonings, put the butter in\r\nthe hot omelet pan and, when melted, turn in the mixture. As it cooks,\r\ndraw the edges toward the centre until the whole is of a creamy\r\nconsistency, brown quickly underneath, fold, and turn on a hot platter.\r\nServe at once. Serves one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scrambled Eggs_\r\n\r\nDouble the quantity of milk given for Creamy Omelet and stir all the\r\ntime while cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Foamy Omelet_[A]\r\n\r\n  1 egg\r\n  1/8 tsp. salt\r\n  1 tbsp. milk or water\r\n  1/2 tsp. butter\r\n  Cayenne or white pepper\r\n\r\nBeat the yolk of the egg until creamy, add seasoning and milk. Beat the\r\nwhite until stiff, but not dry, cut and fold into the yolk carefully.\r\nHeat an omelet pan, rub the bottom and sides with the butter, and turn\r\nin the omelet, spreading it evenly on the pan. Cook gently over the heat\r\nuntil the omelet is set and evenly browned underneath. Put it into a hot\r\noven for a few minutes, to dry slightly on top, fold, and serve\r\nimmediately. Serves one.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDevote one half of the class period to a discussion of the structure of\r\nthe egg and the effect of heat upon it. Use simple experiments or watch\r\nthe poached egg, to make a study of the changes produced in the egg by\r\nthe application of heat. If the pupils are sufficiently experienced, let\r\nthem work together in small groups, first scrambling an egg, then making\r\nan omelet. Demonstrate the cooking of the omelet before the entire\r\nclass. Serve the egg dishes carefully while hot.\r\n\r\n    [A] The omelet recipes given are for individual portions.\r\n    To make a large omelet, multiply the quantity of each\r\n    ingredient by the number of eggs used. The best results\r\n    will be obtained by making an omelet of not more than four\r\n    eggs, as larger omelets are difficult to cook thoroughly\r\n    and to handle well. A two-egg omelet will serve three\r\n    people. A four-egg omelet will serve six people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XII: SIMPLE DESSERTS--CUSTARDS\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nA custard is a combination of eggs and milk, usually sweetened and\r\nflavoured, and either steamed, or baked as cup custard, or cooked in a\r\ndouble boiler as soft custard. The whole egg may be used or the yolks\r\nalone. The yolks make a smoother, richer custard.\r\n\r\nThe eggs must be thoroughly mixed, but not beaten light, the sugar and\r\nsalt added, and the milk scalded and stirred in slowly. The custard must\r\nbe strained through a fine sieve and cooked at a moderate temperature.\r\nIt is desirable to strain a custard, in order to remove the cords and\r\npieces of the membrane which inclosed the yolk. The cup custard should\r\nbe strained before cooking, the soft custard may be strained afterwards.\r\n\r\nA soft custard is cooked over water and is stirred constantly until\r\ndone. When done, the froth disappears from the surface, the custard is\r\nthickened and coats the spoon and sides of the pan, and there is no sign\r\nof curdling. If the custard is cooked too long, it becomes curdled. If\r\nit becomes curdled, put it into a pan of cold water and beat until\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\nA steamed or baked custard is done when it becomes set and when a silver\r\nknife will come out clean after cutting it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThis lesson will furnish an opportunity for a review of milk and eggs.\r\nThe pupils should arrange to bring the necessary materials from their\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Steamed Custards_\r\n\r\n  1 qt. milk (heated)\r\n  4 eggs or 8 egg yolks\r\n  1/2 c. sugar\r\n  1/4 tsp. salt\r\n  2 tbsp. caramel or 1/2 tsp. nutmeg\r\n\r\nBeat the eggs sufficiently to mix them thoroughly; add the sugar, salt,\r\nand hot milk slowly.\r\n\r\nStrain into cups, flavour with caramel, or sprinkle nutmeg on top, and\r\nsteam until firm over gently boiling water--from 20 to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baked Custards_\r\n\r\nPrepare as for Steamed Custards, set in a pan of hot water, and bake in\r\na slow oven until firm--from 20 to 40 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chocolate Custards_\r\n\r\nUse the recipe for Steamed Custards, adding 1 ounce of chocolate\r\n(melted) to the hot milk. Steam or bake as desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soft Custard_\r\n\r\n  1 pt. milk (heated)\r\n  4 egg yolks\r\n  1/16 tsp. salt\r\n  1/2 tsp. vanilla extract\r\n  4 tbsp. sugar\r\n\r\nBeat the egg yolks sufficiently to mix them thoroughly, add the sugar,\r\nsalt, and hot milk slowly. Cook over water that is boiling gently. Stir\r\nconstantly until the custard thickens. Strain. Flavour when cool.\r\n\r\nFor soft Chocolate Custard add 1/2 ounce chocolate (melted) to the hot\r\nmilk. Serves six.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Floating Island_\r\n\r\nUse recipe for Soft Custard and, when cold, garnish with a meringue made\r\naccording to the following recipe:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Meringue_\r\n\r\n  4 egg whites\r\n  1/4 c. powdered sugar\r\n\r\nBeat the egg whites very light, add powdered sugar, and continue\r\nbeating. Drop in large spoonfuls on the cold custard. Serves eight to\r\nten.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to teach two or three recipes in this lesson. The\r\nbaked custard may be put into the oven while the soft custard or\r\nfloating island is being made. Serve at the school lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIII: BATTERS AND DOUGHS\r\n\r\n_Griddle Cakes_\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\n_Batters._--Batters are mixtures of flour or meal and a liquid, with\r\nsalt or sugar to give flavour, butter to make tender, and steam, air, or\r\ngas to make light.\r\n\r\nOne scant measure of liquid is used with one measure of flour for thin,\r\nor pour, batter. One measure of liquid is used with two measures of\r\nflour for a thick, or drop, batter. One measure of liquid is used with\r\nthree measures of flour for a soft, or bread, dough. One measure of\r\nliquid is used with four measures of flour for a stiff, or pastry,\r\ndough.\r\n\r\nBefore mixing a batter, the oven or griddle should be at the proper\r\ntemperature, with the fire well regulated and in good condition. The\r\noven should be tested by putting in a piece of white paper or two\r\ntablespoonfuls of flour, which should brown in three minutes. The pans\r\nshould be prepared by greasing with lard, salt pork, or beef dripping.\r\nAll the materials should be measured and ready before beginning to\r\ncombine the ingredients. When the batter has been mixed and beaten until\r\nsmooth, it should be baked at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe teacher will be better prepared to give the lesson on batters if she\r\nfirst makes herself familiar with the kinds of breads that are used in\r\nthe homes of the pupils and the methods followed in their preparation.\r\nThe simple, general methods of preparing batters should be taught. The\r\nteacher should not attempt the preparation of more than one or two\r\nbatters in this lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Sour-milk Griddle Cakes_\r\n\r\n  2-1/2 c. flour\r\n  1/2 tsp. salt\r\n  1-1/4 tsp. soda\r\n  1 egg\r\n  2 c. sour milk\r\n\r\nMix and sift the flour, salt, and soda; add the sour milk and egg well\r\nbeaten. Drop, by spoonfuls, on a greased hot griddle; cook on one side.\r\nWhen puffed full of bubbles and cooked on the edges, turn, and cook on\r\nthe other side. Serve with butter and maple syrup.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sweet-milk Griddle Cakes_\r\n\r\n  3 c. flour\r\n  1-1/2 tbsp. baking-powder\r\n  1 tsp. salt\r\n  1/4 c. sugar\r\n  2 c. milk\r\n  1 egg\r\n  2 tbsp. melted butter\r\n\r\nMix and sift the dry ingredients, beat the egg, add the milk, and pour\r\non the first mixture. Beat thoroughly and add the butter. Cook the same\r\nas Sour-milk Griddle Cakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDiscuss batters briefly. Have all measurements made, the fire regulated,\r\nthe pans prepared, and so on. Demonstrate the mixing and cooking of\r\nGriddle Cakes. Serve the cakes daintily after they are cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIV: BATTERS AND DOUGHS--Continued\r\n\r\n_Muffins--Baking-powder Biscuits_\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\n_Methods of making batters light._--Batters are made light by beating\r\nair into them, by adding eggs into which air has been beaten, or by\r\nentangling gas in the batter. Gas is secured by using soda and sour milk\r\nin a batter (one teaspoon of soda to one pint of sour milk), or soda\r\nwith molasses (one teaspoon of soda to one cup of molasses), or soda\r\nwith cream of tartar (one teaspoon of soda with two slightly rounding\r\nteaspoons of cream of tartar). The soda should be mixed well with the\r\nother dry ingredients, then the sour milk or molasses added, the whole\r\nbeaten up quickly, and baked at once.\r\n\r\nBaking-powder is a preparation containing soda and cream of tartar, and\r\nmay be used in place of soda if sweet milk is used. Two level\r\nteaspoonfuls of baking-powder should be used with one cup of flour.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThis lesson is a continuation of the lesson on batters. Care should be\r\ntaken not to undertake more than can be done well in the time available.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Graham Muffins_\r\n\r\n  1 c. graham flour\r\n  1 c. flour\r\n  1/4 c. sugar\r\n  1 tsp. salt\r\n  1 c. milk\r\n  1 egg\r\n  1 tbsp. melted butter\r\n  4 tsp. baking-powder\r\n\r\nMix and sift the dry ingredients. Gradually add the milk, the egg\r\nwell-beaten, and the melted butter. Bake in a hot oven in greased gem\r\npans for 25 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plain Muffins_\r\n\r\n  1/4 c. butter\r\n  1/4 c. sugar\r\n  1 egg\r\n  3/4 c. milk\r\n  2 c. flour\r\n  3 tsp. baking-powder\r\n\r\nCream the butter, add the sugar and egg well beaten, sift the\r\nbaking-powder with the flour, and add to the first mixture, alternating\r\nwith the milk. Bake in greased gem pans for 25 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baking-powder Biscuits_\r\n\r\n  2 c. flour\r\n  4 tsp. baking-powder\r\n  1 tsp. salt\r\n  2 tbsp. fat\r\n  3/4 to 1 c. milk or water\r\n\r\nSift the dry ingredients together, chop the fat into the flour with a\r\nknife, slowly add sufficient milk to make a dough not too soft to be\r\nhandled. Toss and roll the dough gently on a slightly-floured board and\r\ncut into small biscuits. Moisten the tops with a little milk. Handle the\r\ndough quickly, lightly, and as little as possible. Place on a buttered\r\nsheet. Bake in a hot oven till brown--from 12 to 15 minutes. Either\r\nwhite or whole wheat flour may be used for the biscuits. Serves six to\r\neight. Oven test--the oven should be hot enough to colour a piece of\r\nunglazed white paper to a golden brown in one minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soda Biscuits_\r\n\r\n  2 c. flour\r\n  1/2 tsp. soda (scant)\r\n  1/2 tsp. salt\r\n  1 c. sour milk (scant)\r\n  2 tbsp. shortening (lard or other fat)\r\n\r\nProceed as for Baking-powder Biscuits.\r\n\r\nIf the sour milk is not thick enough to curdle, it will not contain\r\nsufficient acid to neutralize the soda, and the biscuits will be yellow\r\nand bitter. To avoid this, cream of tartar may be mixed with the soda (1\r\nteaspoonful). If there is no cream of tartar at hand, it will be wise to\r\nuse the recipe for Baking-powder Biscuits.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nHave the oven and pans prepared and all the measurements made.\r\nDemonstrate the mixing of the muffins and, while these are baking, the\r\nmixing of the biscuits. Have one pupil take charge of the baking of the\r\nmuffins and another of the baking of the biscuits. When the breads are\r\ndone, have the class sit down and serve them to one another, or to all\r\nthe pupils at the school lunch hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XV: MEATS\r\n\r\n_Composition and food value. How to make tough cuts of meat palatable.\r\nPork chops with fried apples. Beef or mutton stew with vegetables and\r\ndumplings. Rabbit stew. Bacon._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nMeats are rich in protein and usually in fats, but are lacking in the\r\ncarbohydrates. They build up the muscular tissue, furnish heat and\r\nenergy, are more stimulating and strengthening than any other food, and\r\nsatisfy hunger for a greater length of time. For the most part, meats\r\nare a very expensive food. One cannot perform more labour by the use of\r\na meat diet than on a diet of vegetable foods. Those who use large\r\nquantities of meat suffer from many disturbances of the system. Hence it\r\nshould form a very small part of the diet. The cuts of meat that come\r\nfrom those portions of the animal\'s body that are much exercised are\r\ntough, owing to the development of the connective tissues, but they\r\ncontain a high percentage of nutrition. For the same reason, the meat\r\nfrom older animals is apt to be tough. The flesh of chickens, turkeys,\r\nand other fowls is very nutritious and is easily digested if not too\r\nfat.\r\n\r\nThe flavour of meats is developed by cooking. Dry heat develops the best\r\nflavour, hence the tender cuts are cooked by the processes known as\r\nbroiling and roasting. Tough cuts of meat require long, slow cooking in\r\nmoist heat, hence they are prepared in the form of stews and pot roasts\r\nor are used in meat soups.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nAfter the teacher has found out what meats are used in the homes or what\r\nthe school can afford to use, she should determine upon a method of\r\ncooking that will make the meat palatable, digestible, and attractive.\r\nIf it can be prepared as a stew, she should use a recipe in which\r\nvegetables are also used and, if possible, have dumplings prepared to\r\nserve with the meat, as a review of the lesson on batters.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Beef or Mutton Stew_\r\n\r\n  2 lb. beef or mutton\r\n  1 qt. water\r\n  Salt, pepper, flour to dredge\r\n  1 onion, cut in slices\r\n  1/2 c. turnip cut in dice\r\n  3/4 c. carrot cut in dice\r\n  4 potatoes cut in 1/2-inch slices\r\n  1 tsp. salt\r\n  1/4 tsp. pepper\r\n  1/2 c. flour\r\n  1/4 c. cold water\r\n\r\nRemove the fat and cut the meat into 1-inch pieces. Reserve half of the\r\nbest pieces of meat, put the rest of the meat and the bone into cold\r\nwater, soak for one hour, then heat until it bubbles. Season half the\r\nraw meat and roll it in the flour, melt the fat in a frying-pan, remove\r\nthe scraps, brown the sliced onion and then the floured meat in the hot\r\nfat, add both to the stew, and cook for 2 hours at a low temperature. To\r\nthis add the vegetables and cook 1/2 hour; then add the flour and\r\nseasonings, which have been mixed with one-half cup of cold water, and\r\ncook for 1/2 hour longer, until the meat and vegetables are tender.\r\nRemove the bone from the stew and serve. Serves six to eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rabbit_\r\n\r\nIf beef and mutton are not commonly used and are not readily obtainable,\r\nbut rabbit can be secured, substitute rabbit for beef in the stew. After\r\nthe rabbit has been thoroughly cleaned, cut up in eight pieces (four leg\r\nand four body pieces), season, and dredge with flour, brown in the fat,\r\nand proceed as with Beef Stew.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dumplings_\r\n\r\n  2 c. flour\r\n  4 tsp. baking-powder\r\n  1/2 tsp. salt\r\n  2 tbsp. fat (lard or butter)\r\n  3/4 c. milk or water (about)\r\n\r\nSift the dry ingredients together, cut in the butter, and add the milk\r\ngradually, to make a soft dough. Roll out on a floured board, cut with a\r\nbiscuit cutter, lay on top of meat in a stew pan (they should not sink\r\ninto the liquid), cover the kettle closely, keep the stew boiling, and\r\ncook the dumplings for 10 minutes without removing the lid. (Do not put\r\nthe dumplings in to cook until the meat is tender.)\r\n\r\n    _Note._--If desired, the rolling may be eliminated and,\r\n    after mixing, the dough may be dropped by spoonfuls into\r\n    the stew.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Cook Bacon_\r\n\r\nPlace thin slices of bacon from which the rind has been removed in a hot\r\nfrying-pan, and pour off the fat as fast as it melts. Cook until the\r\nbacon is crisp and brown, turning frequently. Another method of cooking\r\nis to lay the bacon on a rack in a baking-pan and bake in a hot oven\r\nuntil crisp and brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pork Chops_\r\n\r\nWipe the chops with a damp cloth, and place in a hot frying-pan. Turn\r\nfrequently at first and cook slowly until well browned on each side.\r\nSprinkle with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fried Apples_\r\n\r\nWash and core the apples and slice to the centre. Roll in flour if very\r\njuicy.\r\n\r\nAfter the chops have been removed from the pan, lay the apples in and\r\ncook till tender. Serve around the chops.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nIf the meat is to require two or three hours\' cooking, arrange to have\r\nthe lesson divided and given at two periods through the day. Half an\r\nhour before opening the morning session or a portion of the morning or\r\nnoon recess may be sufficient time to put the meat on to cook and to\r\nprepare the vegetables. When the second class period is called, the\r\nvegetables should be added to the partially cooked meat and the\r\ndumplings should be made. It would be well to serve the completed dish\r\nat the lunch period. There should be as much discussion regarding the\r\nkinds of meat, their food value, and the methods of cooking as time\r\npermits; but it may be necessary to complete this discussion at some\r\nother class period.\r\n\r\nShould it be possible for the teacher to give additional lessons on\r\nmeat, it might be well to devote one lesson to the preparation and\r\ncooking of poultry, directions for which may be secured from any\r\nreliable cook-book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVI: BAKED PORK AND BEANS--BAKING-POWDER BISCUITS\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nPeas, beans, and lentils which are dried for market contain a high\r\npercentage of protein, carbohydrate, and mineral matter. They form an\r\nexcellent substitute for meat and are much cheaper in price. The\r\ndigestion of leguminous foods proceeds slowly, involving a large amount\r\nof work: on this account they are not desirable for invalids, but they\r\nare satisfactory for those who are well and active. The dried legumes\r\nmust be soaked overnight in water and then cooked for a long time, in\r\norder to soften the cellulose and develop the flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to plan this lesson several days in advance, if the\r\nbeans are to be baked. As they will be prepared and put on to bake\r\nbefore the lesson period, the Baking-powder Biscuits may be made during\r\nthe lesson, to serve with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPE\r\n\r\n_Boston Baked Beans_\r\n\r\n  1 qt. navy beans\r\n  1 tbsp. salt\r\n  1/2 tbsp. mustard\r\n  3 tbsp. sugar\r\n  2 tbsp. molasses\r\n  1 c. boiling water\r\n  1/2 lb. fat salt pork\r\n  Boiling water to cover\r\n\r\nLook over the beans and soak them in cold water overnight.\r\n\r\nIn the morning drain, cover with fresh water, and simmer them until the\r\nskins will burst, but do not let the beans become broken.\r\n\r\nScald one-half pound of fat salt pork. Scrape the pork. Put a slice in\r\nthe bottom of the bean pot. Cut the remaining pork across the top in\r\nstrips just through the rind, and bury the pork in beans, leaving the\r\nrind exposed.\r\n\r\nAdd one cup of boiling water to seasonings and pour over the beans.\r\nCover with boiling water. Bake slowly, adding more water as necessary.\r\nBake from 6 to 8 hours, uncover at the last, so that the water will\r\nevaporate and the beans brown on top. Serves twelve.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nHave the beans washed and put to soak the night before the lesson is to\r\nbe given. Assign to one of the pupils the task of putting them on to\r\nsimmer early the next morning. Call the class together for a few moments\r\nwhen the beans are ready to bake. Assign one of the pupils to attend to\r\nthe fire and the oven. Let the beans bake all day. If the lesson is to\r\nbe given late in the afternoon, the beans may be ready to serve, or the\r\ncooking may be continued on the second day and the lesson completed\r\nthen. It would be well to serve the dish at the lunch period. Have the\r\nbiscuits prepared to serve with the baked beans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVII: BUTTER CAKES--PLAIN YELLOW CAKE--COCOA--COFFEE--TEA\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\n_Cakes._--Cakes made with fat resemble other batters, except that the\r\nfat, sugar, and eggs are usually larger in amount and the texture of the\r\nbaked batter is finer and more tender.\r\n\r\nWhen preparing cake, first get the pans ready. Grease them or line them\r\nwith greased paper. Make sure that the oven is at the proper\r\ntemperature. For a small cake, the oven should be hot enough to brown a\r\npiece of unglazed paper or a tablespoonful of flour in three minutes.\r\nBake a small cake from twenty to thirty minutes. When done, the cake\r\nwill shrink from the sides of the pan; the crust will spring back when\r\ntouched with the finger; the loud ticking sound will cease; a fine\r\nknitting-needle will come out clean if the cake is pierced; and the\r\ncrust will be nicely browned. When the cake is removed from the oven,\r\nlet it stand in the pan for about three minutes, then loosen, and turn\r\nout gently. Do not handle while hot. Keep in a clean, ventilated tin box\r\nin a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\n_Cocoa._--Chocolate and cocoa are prepared from the bean of a tropical\r\ntree. This bean is rich in protein, fat, carbohydrate, mineral matter,\r\nand a stimulant called theobromine. In the preparation of chocolate the\r\nseeds are cleaned, milled, and crushed into a paste. In the preparation\r\nof cocoa much of the fat is removed, and the cocoa is packed for market\r\nin the form of a fine powder. Cocoa is more easily digested than\r\nchocolate, because it contains less fat. Though the amount of cocoa used\r\nin a cup of this beverage is not large, when prepared with milk it\r\nserves as a nutritious food. It is slightly stimulating as well, because\r\nof the theobromine present and because it is served hot.\r\n\r\n_Coffee and Tea._--Coffee and tea have no food value when prepared as\r\nbeverages. They contain stimulating properties that are harmful to the\r\nbody if taken in large quantities and, on this account, they should be\r\nused with discretion. They should never be given to children or to those\r\ntroubled with indigestion. If carelessly prepared, both coffee and tea\r\nmay be decidedly harmful to the body. Coffee should not be boiled for\r\nmore than eight minutes. Tea should never be permitted to boil. Fresh,\r\nboiling water should be poured on the leaves and left for three minutes.\r\nIt should then be strained off and kept hot until used.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIt may be wise to give this lesson on some special occasion, as it is\r\nwell adapted to serve for the refreshments for a mother\'s club or a\r\nlittle class party.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Plain Yellow Cake_\r\n\r\n  1/2 c. butter\r\n  1 c. sugar\r\n  2 eggs\r\n  1/2 c. milk\r\n  2 tsp. baking-powder\r\n  1-1/2 c. flour\r\n  1 tsp. spice or 1-1/2 tsp. flavouring\r\n\r\nCream the butter, add the sugar gradually, and mix well. Add the\r\nwell-beaten yolks of eggs, then the flour and baking-powder alternately\r\nwith the milk. Then add the flavouring and cut and fold in the whites of\r\nthe eggs carefully. Turn into buttered pans and bake at once in a\r\nmoderately hot oven.\r\n\r\nFor chocolate cake, 2 ounces of melted chocolate may be added after the\r\nyolks of the eggs. Serves sixteen to twenty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gingerbread_\r\n\r\n  1/4 c. butter\r\n  1/2 c. brown sugar\r\n  1 egg\r\n  1/2 c. molasses\r\n  1/2 c. milk (sour if possible)\r\n  1/2 tsp. soda\r\n  1-3/4 c. flour\r\n  1 tsp. ginger\r\n  1/2 tsp. cinnamon\r\n  Salt\r\n\r\nCream the butter, add the sugar gradually, then a well-beaten egg. Add\r\nthe molasses. Sift all the dry ingredients together and add alternately\r\nwith the milk. Bake in a buttered tin or in gem pans in a moderate oven\r\nfor 25 or 35 minutes. Serves eight to ten.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cocoa_\r\n\r\n  1/4 c. cocoa\r\n  1/4 c. sugar\r\n  1 c. water\r\n  3 c. milk\r\n\r\nMix the cocoa and sugar with the water and boil from 3 to 5 minutes.\r\nStir into the hot milk and serve at once. If a scum forms, beat with a\r\nDover egg-beater. Serves eight to ten.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tea_\r\n\r\n  1 tsp. green or 2 tsp. black tea\r\n  2 c. boiling water (freshly boiling)\r\n\r\nScald the tea-pot, put the tea in the tea-pot, and pour boiling water\r\nover it; steep 3 minutes, strain, and serve. Serves four.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffee_\r\n\r\nTake two tablespoonfuls of ground coffee for each cup of boiling water\r\nthat is to be used. Put the coffee in the coffee-pot and add enough cold\r\nwater to moisten the coffee and make it stick together--about one\r\nteaspoonful of water to each tablespoonful of coffee. Pour the boiling\r\nwater over the coffee and boil it for 3 minutes. Place it where it will\r\nkeep hot, but not boil, for 5 minutes or more, and then serve. If a\r\nsmall amount of egg white and shell is mixed with the coffee grounds and\r\ncold water, it will aid in clarifying and settling the coffee.\r\n\r\n    _Note._--The recipes for coffee and tea are given, so that\r\n    the teacher can discuss their preparation with the pupils\r\n    and compare their value with that of cocoa. If coffee and\r\n    tea are both commonly used in the homes, it may be well to\r\n    have the pupils prepare both in the class, to be sure that\r\n    they understand how to make them properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nBegin the lesson period with a discussion of the methods of preparing\r\ncakes, and put the cake in the oven as soon as possible. While it is\r\nbaking, prepare the cocoa. If the cocoa is not to be served for some\r\ntime, it can be kept hot or re-heated over hot water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVIII: YEAST BREAD\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nYeast bread is made light by the presence of a gas produced by the\r\naction of yeast in the sponge or dough. Yeast is a microscopic plant\r\nwhich grows in a moist, warm temperature and feeds on starchy materials\r\nsuch as are present in wheat. A portion of the starch is converted into\r\nsugar (thus developing new and pleasant flavours), and some is still\r\nfurther changed, giving off the gas upon which the lightness of the\r\nbread depends. If the yeast is allowed to work for too long a time or\r\nthe temperature is very hot, a souring of the dough may result. This\r\nsouring can be prevented by kneading the dough thoroughly, as soon as it\r\nhas risen well or doubled in bulk, or by putting it in a very hot oven\r\nto bake, when it has reached this stage. The yeast plant thrives in a\r\nheat of about the same temperature as our bodies. A little extra heat\r\nwill only make it more active, but boiling temperature will kill it.\r\nCold makes yeast inactive, though it does not kill the plants.\r\n\r\nYeast develops in a natural state on hops and other plants. It is\r\nprepared for market in the form of dry or moist cakes. The latter must\r\nbe kept very cold. For home use, a liquid yeast is often prepared from\r\nthe dry cakes. This has the advantage of being more active.\r\n\r\nWhen the yeast has been added to a batter, it is spoken of as a sponge.\r\nWhen the batter has had enough flour added, so that it may be handled,\r\nit is called a dough. If the bread is to be made in a few hours, the\r\nyeast is made up at once into a dough. If it is to stand overnight, a\r\nsponge is often made first. More yeast is required for quick rising. In\r\nordinary circumstances, one yeast cake is sufficient for one quart of\r\nliquid. Thorough kneading and baking are both essential to the success\r\nof the bread.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nArrange to have the class meet the afternoon before, in order to begin\r\nthe process by making the sponge, and to come early in the morning to\r\ncare for the dough. Begin the study of flour, yeast, and bread in a\r\nprevious class period, correlating the work with geography, nature\r\nstudy, or some other subject. Either white or whole-wheat flour may be\r\nused for the breads.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Bread_\r\n\r\n(Prepared with dry yeast)\r\n\r\n  1 dry yeast cake\r\n  1 c. warm water\r\n  1 c. flour\r\n  1 qt. water or milk (scalded)\r\n  Flour enough to make a soft dough\r\n  2 tsp. salt\r\n  2 tbsp. sugar\r\n  2 tbsp. lard or butter\r\n\r\nAt noon put a dry yeast cake to soak in a cup of warm water. When it is\r\nsoft, add a cup of flour, cover, and put in a warm place to grow light.\r\nThis will require several hours.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, when ready to begin the dough, mix the salt, sugar, fat,\r\nand hot liquid in a large bowl; when lukewarm, add the cup of light\r\nyeast and enough flour to knead (about three quarts). Mix thoroughly and\r\nknead it into a smooth dough, and continue this process until it is soft\r\nand elastic. Return the dough to the bowl, moisten, cover, and set in a\r\nmoderately warm place for the night. Be sure that the place is free from\r\ndraughts. In the morning knead slightly; divide into loaves or shape in\r\nrolls; put into pans for baking; cover, and let it rise until double in\r\nbulk. Bake large loaves from 50 to 60 minutes. Rolls will bake in from\r\n25 to 35 minutes, for they require a hotter oven. It is of the utmost\r\nimportance that all yeast breads be thoroughly cooked. (Makes 4 loaves.)\r\n\r\n(Time required for making bread with dry yeast, from 16 to 20 hours.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bread_\r\n\r\n(Prepared with compressed yeast)\r\n\r\n  2 c. milk or water (scalded)\r\n  2 tsp. salt\r\n  2 tsp. sugar\r\n  1 tbsp. lard or butter\r\n  1/4 cake compressed yeast (1 cake if set in morning)\r\n  1/4 c. water (lukewarm)\r\n  Flour, white or whole wheat\r\n\r\nPut the hot water or milk, salt, sugar, and fat in a bowl; when\r\nlukewarm, and the yeast softened in the lukewarm water, then the flour\r\ngradually and, when stiff enough to handle, turn the dough out on a\r\nfloured board and knead until soft and elastic (20 minutes). Return the\r\ndough to the bowl, moisten, cover, and let it rise in a warm place until\r\ndouble in bulk; then knead slightly, divide into loaves or shape into\r\nrolls, cover, and let rise in the pan in which they are to be baked\r\nuntil double in bulk, and bake from 50 to 60 minutes. (Makes 2 loaves.)\r\n\r\n(Time required for making bread, if one cake of compressed yeast is\r\nused, 6 hours.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nIf the class is large, prepare two or three bowls of sponge, so that all\r\ncan have some practice in stirring and kneading. Do not make too large a\r\nquantity of bread to bake in the oven, unless arrangements can be made\r\nto do some of the baking at the home of one of the pupils. Use the bread\r\nfor the school lunch or divide it among the class to take home.\r\n\r\nPlan a bread contest, so that each pupil will be interested in making\r\nbread at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIX: SERVING A SIMPLE DINNER WITHOUT MEAT--BAKED OMELET--MACARONI\r\nAND CHEESE\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN AND METHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nAt some previous time the teacher should discuss with the pupils the\r\nplans for the dinner. It may be well to let them invite the members of\r\nthe school board or others interested in their work to partake of the\r\ndinner. They should decide on the menu, with the help and suggestions of\r\nthe teacher, and should choose foods that they can bring from their\r\nhomes. The main course should consist of such a vegetable dish as baked\r\nbeans, an omelet, or macaroni with white sauce and grated cheese. To\r\naccompany this there should be potatoes and a fresh green vegetable,\r\nsuch as spinach or cabbage, and a hot bread.\r\n\r\nA simple dessert which the pupils know how to make should be chosen. One\r\nduty should be assigned to each pupil, and she should be entirely\r\nresponsible for that portion of the dinner. The teacher should supervise\r\nall the work carefully.\r\n\r\nInstructions for making the menu cards may be given in a drawing lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Baked Omelet_\r\n\r\n  2 tbsp. butter\r\n  2 tbsp. flour\r\n  1/2 tsp. salt\r\n  1 c. milk, heated\r\n  4 eggs\r\n  2 tsp. fat\r\n  Pepper\r\n\r\nMelt the butter, add the flour and seasonings, mix thoroughly, then add\r\nthe hot milk slowly. Separate the eggs, beat the yolks, and add the\r\nwhite sauce to them. Beat the whites until stiff and cut and fold them\r\ncarefully into the yolk mixture, so that the lightness is all retained.\r\nTurn into a greased baking-dish and bake in a moderate oven from 20 to\r\n30 minutes. Serve hot. Serves six.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Macaroni and Cheese_\r\n\r\n  1 c. macaroni, noodles, or rice\r\n  2 tbsp. fat\r\n  3 tbsp. flour\r\n  1/2 tsp. salt\r\n  Pepper\r\n  1-1/2 c. milk\r\n  1 c. grated cheese\r\n  2 c. buttered bread crumbs (two tbsp. butter or other fat)\r\n\r\nBreak the macaroni into 1-inch pieces and cook it in a large amount of\r\nsalted boiling water from 30 to 45 minutes. Drain it well when tender\r\nand pour cold water through it.\r\n\r\nBreak up the bread crumbs and add two tablespoonfuls of melted butter to\r\nthem. Grate the cheese and make a white sauce of the fat, flour,\r\nseasonings, and milk. Mix the cheese with the sauce, add the macaroni,\r\nand pour it into a buttered baking-dish. Cover with the bread crumbs and\r\nbake 15 or 20 minutes, to brown the crumbs. Serves eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XX: SUGAR\r\n\r\n_Food value and cooking. The use of peanuts in candy. Peanut cookies, or\r\npeanut, molasses, or fudge candies, to be made for a special\r\nentertainment._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nSugar is valuable to the body as a source of heat and energy. While it\r\nis easy of digestion, it is very irritating to the body if taken in\r\nlarge quantities and, on this account, it should be taken in small\r\nquantities and preferably at meal time or with other food. Two or three\r\npieces of candy taken at the end of the meal will not be hurtful, but\r\nwhen eaten habitually between meals, it is sure to produce harmful\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nSugar is present in many fruits and in most vegetables. Milk contains a\r\nlarge percentage of sugar. In preparing foods to which the addition of\r\nsugar seems desirable, care should be taken not to add it in large\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nAs it is desirable to have a discussion regarding sugar and its value to\r\nthe body, the preparation of cookies or candy for some school function\r\nor Christmas party may be undertaken in conjunction with this lesson,\r\nwhich should be given at a time when it will mean most to the pupils.\r\nThe work should be so planned that they will learn something of the\r\nprinciples of sugar cookery, as well as the specific recipes they are\r\nusing.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\n_Cookies_\r\n\r\n  1 c. fat\r\n  1 c. sugar\r\n  2 eggs\r\n  1/4 c. milk\r\n  3 c. flour\r\n  3 tsp. baking-powder\r\n  1 tbsp. cinnamon\r\n  1/2 c. sugar\r\n\r\nCream the butter and add the sugar and well-beaten eggs. Then add the\r\nmilk alternately with the sifted dry flour (sifted with baking-powder).\r\nMix to the consistency of a soft dough, adding more milk if necessary.\r\nRoll lightly, cut in shapes, and dip in the one-half cup of sugar and\r\ncinnamon that have been sifted together. Place on buttered sheets and\r\nbake in a hot oven for about 10 minutes. Slip from the pan and lay on\r\nthe cake cooler. To make a softer cookie, use only one-half cup of\r\nbutter. (Three to four dozen.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peanut Cookies_\r\n\r\n  2 tbsp. butter\r\n  1/4 c. sugar\r\n  1 egg\r\n  1 tsp. baking-powder\r\n  1/8 tsp. salt\r\n  1/2 c. flour\r\n  2 tsp. milk\r\n  1/2 c. finely chopped peanuts\r\n  1/2 tsp. lemon juice\r\n  2 doz. whole peanuts shelled\r\n\r\nCream the butter and add the sugar and the egg well beaten. Add the milk\r\nand sifted dry ingredients, alternately, to the first mixture, then the\r\npeanuts and lemon juice. Drop from a teaspoon on a baking sheet an inch\r\napart and place 1/2 peanut on top of each. Bake from 12 to 15 minutes in\r\na moderate oven. (Two and a half to three dozen.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peanut Brittle_\r\n\r\n  1 c. sugar\r\n  1 c. peanuts in the shell\r\n\r\nStir the sugar over the heat, constantly, until it becomes a clear\r\nliquid. Take at once from the heat, add the prepared peanuts, and pour\r\non a warm, buttered tin. Mark in squares and cool. Serves ten.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Molasses Candy_\r\n\r\n  2 c. molasses\r\n  2/3 c. sugar\r\n  1 tbsp. vinegar\r\n  1/4 tsp. soda\r\n  2 tbsp. butter\r\n\r\nPut the molasses, sugar, and butter into a thick sauce-pan or kettle and\r\nstir until the sugar is dissolved. Boil until the mixture becomes\r\nbrittle when tried in cold water. Stir constantly at the last to prevent\r\nburning. Add vinegar and soda just before removing from the fire. Pour\r\ninto a well-greased pan and let it stand until cool enough to handle.\r\nThen pull until light and porous and cut in small pieces with scissors,\r\narranging on buttered plates. Serves sixteen to twenty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fudge_\r\n\r\n  2 c. sugar\r\n  1 c. milk\r\n  1 tbsp. butter\r\n  1/2 c. nuts, broken up\r\n\r\nPut the sugar and the milk in a sauce-pan and stir over the heat until\r\nthe sugar is dissolved. Add the butter and boil to the "soft ball"\r\nstage. Take from the heat and beat until creamy. Add the nuts and pour\r\non buttered pans. When cool, cut in squares. Serves sixteen to eighteen.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nDevote, if possible, a separate period to the discussion of the food\r\nvalue and cooking of sugar; then assign two recipes for the practical\r\nwork, allowing the pupils to work in groups. Assign only as much work as\r\ncan be carefully supervised. Do not undertake both the cookies and the\r\ncandy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWENTY LESSONS IN SEWING\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS TO THE TEACHER\r\n\r\nThe teacher should be familiar with the conditions in which the pupils\r\nlive, should know how much money they can afford to pay for materials,\r\nwhat materials are available, what previous experience in hand work they\r\nhave had, whether they can afford to have sewing-machines in their own\r\nhomes, and to what extent they make their own clothes or buy them\r\nready-made.\r\n\r\nThe lessons should be planned to furnish hand training, to give pupils\r\npractical instruction in the care of their own clothes, and to provide\r\nan opportunity for preparing the apron for the cooking lessons. The\r\nlesson course should tend to develop habits of thrift, industry, and\r\nneatness. The pupils should be encouraged to learn to sew, both to\r\nimprove their own home conditions and to give them suggestions as to a\r\npossible means of livelihood. If sewing-machines are available and are\r\nin use in the homes, it is well to have lessons given in machine sewing\r\nand to have the long seams run by machine. If the pupils cannot have\r\nsewing-machines in their own homes, the lessons given should be limited\r\nto sewing by hand. In some schools, it may be necessary to simplify the\r\nlessons; in others, an increased number of articles may be prepared in\r\nthe time allotted. Should the apron and cap not be needed for the\r\ncooking class, an undergarment (corset cover) may well be\r\nsubstituted.[A]\r\n\r\n    [A] Should the teacher feel that an apron or corset-cover\r\n    is too large a piece for her pupils to undertake, and\r\n    should she desire to have more time spent on the first ten\r\n    lessons. Lessons XI to XVIII may be omitted, two periods\r\n    each devoted to both Lessons XIX and XX, and three lessons\r\n    used for the making of a simple needle-book or other small\r\n    piece.\r\n\r\nFor each lesson the teacher should have in mind a definite plan of\r\nprocedure. The lesson should be opened with a brief and concrete class\r\ndiscussion of the new work that is to be taken up or the special stage\r\nthat has been reached in work that is already under way. Though\r\nindividual instruction is necessary, it should not take the place of\r\nthis general presentation of the subject-matter, which economizes time\r\nand develops the real thought content of the work. Whenever possible,\r\nthe teacher should endeavour to correlate this work with the other\r\nsubjects on the curriculum.\r\n\r\nNew stitches may be demonstrated on large pieces of scrim, with long\r\ndarning-needles and coarse red or black yarn. The scrim should be pinned\r\nto the black-board with thumb tacks, and the stitches made large enough\r\nfor all to see without difficulty. A variety of completed articles\r\nshould be kept on hand, in order to show additional application of\r\npoints brought out in the lesson. Each class may be given the privilege\r\nof preparing one article to add to this collection, and a spirit of\r\nclass pride and valuable team work may be thereby developed.\r\n\r\nDuring the lesson, posture, neatness, and order should be emphasized.\r\nApplication can be secured by making the problems of interest. Care must\r\nbe taken that none of the work demands unnecessary eye strain. Each\r\nlesson should be closed in time to have one of the members of the class\r\ngive a brief summary of the steps that have been covered.\r\n\r\nSince the class period for sewing in the rural school will necessarily\r\nbe brief, the pupils should be encouraged to continue their work at some\r\nother period. However, no work outside of the class period should be\r\npermitted until the pupil has mastered the stitch and can be trusted to\r\ndo the work in the right way. The privilege of sewing may be made the\r\nreward for lessons quickly learned, home practice may be assigned, or\r\nthe class may meet out of school hours. All outside practice must be\r\ncarefully supervised, the pupil bringing her work to the teacher for\r\nfrequent inspection.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible to keep on hand a permanent equipment for sewing, the\r\nfollowing should be provided for a class of twelve:\r\n\r\n                              Approximate cost\r\n  Scissors, 1 dozen                      $3.00\r\n  Thimbles, 1 dozen                        .50\r\n  Tape-measures, 1 dozen                   .60\r\n  Emery, 1 dozen                           .50\r\n  Boxes for work, 1 dozen                 1.00\r\n                                        ------\r\n                                         $5.60\r\n\r\n    _Note._--Shoe or candy boxes may be used, but an effort\r\n    should be made to have them uniform.\r\n\r\nThe teacher who is to give lessons in sewing should secure a helpful\r\nelementary text-book or some bulletin that deals with the teaching of\r\nsewing.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE BOOKS.\r\n\r\n_School Sewing, Based on Home Problems._ Burton, I.

Talk on cleanliness and\r\nneatness (care of hands, etc.). Discussion of hemming. Hems folded on\r\nsheets of paper._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nA hem is made by twice turning over the edge of a piece of cloth toward\r\nthe worker, and then sewing it down. It is used to finish a narrow edge.\r\nIn turning a narrow hem the first fold must not be so deep as the\r\nsecond, in order that the hem may lie smoothly. If the hem is a wide\r\none, the first fold can be much narrower than the second.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe teacher should have interested the pupils in the sewing lessons\r\nbefore the first meeting of the class, and each pupil should be asked to\r\nbring with her the box in which to keep her materials and such other\r\nequipment as is required. If the school is to furnish the equipment, the\r\nteacher should be sure that there is an adequate supply on hand.\r\n\r\nIt will probably be necessary to have the towels to be used in the\r\ncooking classes hemmed, and the pupils should be interested in doing\r\nthis work. If some of them wish to hem towels for use in their own\r\nhomes, it may be desirable to allow them to do so. Flour or meal sacks\r\nwill answer. It may be well to have each pupil hem a towel for home use,\r\nas well as for school use, in order to impress upon her the desirability\r\nof having hemmed dish-towels for daily use. The towels may be planned\r\nduring this lesson, and the pupils may arrange to bring the material\r\nfrom home, if they are to provide it; but it will be well for the\r\nteacher to have on hand material for one or two towels. Plain paper will\r\nanswer for the practice folding of the hem in the first lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe teacher should devote a few minutes to a talk on cleanliness,\r\nemphasizing its importance, and the necessity for exercising care in\r\nhandling the sewing materials. This should be followed by a discussion\r\nregarding the care of the hands and the condition in which they should\r\nbe for the sewing lesson. Each pupil should inspect her own hands and\r\nshow them to the teacher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 2.--Gauge]\r\n\r\nWhen all the pupils have their hands in a proper condition for sewing,\r\nthe teacher should look over their supplies with them, give them\r\nsuggestions as to how they are to keep these, and let them arrange their\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\nNext, she should tell them what their first work is to be, show them the\r\nmaterial for the towels, and discuss with them the best method of\r\nfinishing the ends. (See Lesson II.)\r\n\r\nBefore turning the hem, the pupils should make a gauge from heavy paper,\r\nnotched to indicate the depth of the hem. A few minutes should be\r\ndevoted to practice in measuring and turning a hem of the desired depth\r\non a sheet of paper. This should give practice in the double turning\r\nnecessary--first, the narrow turn to dispose of the cut edge; second,\r\nthe fold to finish the edge.\r\n\r\nWhen the lesson is finished, the boxes should be put away in systematic\r\norder, and all scraps should be carefully picked up from the desks and\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II: HEMMING TOWELS\r\n\r\n_Turning and basting hems. Hemming towels of crash, sacking, or other\r\nmaterial, for use in washing and drying dishes at home or in school._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 3.--Even basting]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nBasting is used to hold two pieces of material together until a\r\npermanent stitch can be put in. It is done by taking long stitches\r\n(one-fourth inch) from right to left and parallel to the edges that are\r\nto be basted together. In starting, the thread is fastened with a knot;\r\nwhen completed, it is fastened by taking two or three stitches one over\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe teacher should have the necessary materials on hand or should see\r\nthat they are supplied by the pupils. The articles needed will include\r\nmaterial for the towels, white thread for basting and hemming, and\r\ngauges for measuring.\r\n\r\nThe teacher should also have a large square of unbleached cotton or\r\ncanvas, 18 by 18 inches, and a large darning-needle and coloured worsted\r\nthread, to use for demonstration purposes. The canvas should be fastened\r\nto the black-board, where the class can see it easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nAs soon as the class is called, the supplies are at hand, and the hands\r\nare in a proper condition, the teacher should demonstrate the\r\nbasting-stitch, with a large needle and thread, on the square of canvas\r\nthat has been fastened on the wall. Materials for work should be passed.\r\nEach pupil should straighten the ends of her towel by drawing a thread.\r\nThen she should turn and baste a hem three eighths of an inch in depth.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the lesson, the pupils should fold their work carefully\r\nand put it neatly in their boxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON III: HEMMING TOWELS--Continued\r\n\r\n_The overhanding stitch and the hemming stitch._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\n_Overhanding_ (also called overseaming or top sewing).--The edges to be\r\noverhanded are held between the first finger and the thumb of the left\r\nhand, with the edge parallel to the first finger. The needle is inserted\r\njust below and perpendicular to the edge. The needle is pointed straight\r\ntoward the worker. The stitches proceed from right to left, each stitch\r\nbeing taken a little to the left of the preceding stitch. The stitches\r\nshould all be straight on the right side, but they will slant a little\r\non the wrong side. They should not be deep. It may be desirable to use\r\nthis overhanding stitch at the ends of hems, to hold the edges of the\r\nmaterial together. The overhanding stitch is also used for seams, for\r\npatching, and for sewing on lace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 4.--Overhanding]\r\n\r\nThe overhanding of narrow hems is not always necessary, but the ends may\r\nbe made stronger thereby, and the stitch is a valuable one for the\r\npupils to know.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 5.--Hemming]\r\n\r\n_Hemming._--The hemming-stitch is placed on the inside of the hem. The\r\nend of the basted hem is laid over the first and under the second finger\r\nof the left hand, with the folded edge outside and the material toward\r\nthe worker. It is held in place with the thumb. The stitch is begun at\r\nthe end of the hem. The fastening of the thread is concealed by slipping\r\nit underneath the hem in the inside fold of the material. The needle is\r\npointed over the left shoulder, a small stitch is taken by inserting the\r\nneedle through the material just below the hem, then through the folded\r\nedge. This is repeated, making the next stitch nearer the worker and\r\nmoving the goods away from the worker as necessary. Uniformity of slant,\r\nsize, and spacing of the stitches is important.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nBefore this lesson is given, all the pupils should report to the\r\nteacher, having both ends of their towels basted, so that they will all\r\nbe ready to proceed at once with the new stitches.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe teacher should begin by demonstrating on the large square of canvas\r\nwith the large needle and heavy thread the stitches to be used. After\r\noverhanding the end of the hem, the hemming-stitch should follow with\r\nthe same thread. The pupils will probably not be able to finish the\r\nhemming in this first lesson, so provision should be made for additional\r\ntime. This can be required as an outside assignment, if the pupils have\r\nmastered the method during the class period. The teacher may also be\r\nable to give them some supervision while she is looking after other\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON IV: BAGS\r\n\r\n_A school bag. Bag (made of material obtainable) to hold sewing\r\nmaterials. Measuring and straightening the material for the bag. Basting\r\nthe seams._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nThe basting-stitch will be used as a review of work in the second\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nSome time before the lesson, the teacher should discuss with the pupils\r\nthe kind of material they will be able to provide for their bags and, if\r\nthe material has to be purchased, she should suggest something that is\r\nsuitable, washable, and inexpensive. The bag should cost only a few\r\ncents. The dimensions of the finished bag should be about 12 by 18\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe pupils should get out the materials they have brought and determine\r\nupon the size and shape of their bags. It will not be necessary to make\r\nthem uniform. The teacher should help the pupils to use their material\r\nto the best advantage. It should be straightened, pulled in place, and\r\nmeasured carefully. When the bags have been cut out, the sides should be\r\nbasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON V: BAGS--Continued\r\n\r\n_Sewing up the seams with a running-stitch and a back-stitch._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nRunning is done by passing the needle in and out of the material at\r\nregular intervals. Small, even stitches and spaces should follow\r\nconsecutively on both sides of the material. The stitches should be much\r\nshorter than those used for basting, the length being determined largely\r\nby the kind of cloth used.\r\n\r\nWhen running is combined with a back-stitch, two or more\r\nrunning-stitches and one back-stitch are taken alternately. The\r\nback-stitch is a stitch taken backward on the upper side of the cloth,\r\nthe needle being put back each time into the end of the last stitch and\r\nbrought out the same distance beyond the last stitch.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe teacher should be sure that all the pupils are ready to report,\r\nhaving the sides of their bags basted ready for stitching.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe teacher should first demonstrate the running-stitch with the\r\nback-stitch, and the pupils should begin to sew the sides of the bag,\r\nusing this stitch. They should commence sewing three quarters of an inch\r\nfrom the top of the bag, so that there will be a space left for slits in\r\nthe hem through which to run the cord.[A] The seams will doubtless have\r\nto be finished outside of the class hour, and may be assigned for\r\ncompletion before the next lesson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 6.--Running-stitch with a back-stitch]\r\n\r\n    [A] The draw-string, or cord, is to be run through the hem\r\n    from the inside of the bag, and it will be necessary to\r\n    leave three quarters of an inch of space at the ends of\r\n    the seams, to provide slits as outlets for the cord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VI: BAGS--Continued\r\n\r\n_Overcasting the seams and turning the hem at the top of the bag._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nOvercasting is done by taking loose stitches over the raw edge of the\r\ncloth, to keep it from ravelling or fraying.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe teacher should be sure that all the pupils are ready to report,\r\nhaving the sides of their bags neatly sewed with the running-stitch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 7.--Overcasting]\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe teacher should demonstrate the method of overcasting and explain its\r\nuse. She should have the pupils trim the edges of their seams neatly and\r\novercast them carefully. After the seams have been overcast, she should\r\ndiscuss the depth of the hem that the pupils expect to use and the\r\nmethod of turning and basting it. They should then measure, turn, pin,\r\nand baste the hems, using the gauge for determining the depth of the\r\nhem. If the bags are deep enough to admit of a heading at the top, a\r\ndeep hem (about 2-1/2 inches) can be made, and a running-stitch put in\r\none-half inch (or more) above the edge of the hem, to provide a casing,\r\nor space, for the cord. If it is necessary to take a narrow hem, the hem\r\nitself can be made to answer as space for the cord; in this case the hem\r\nshould be made about one-half inch deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VII: BAGS--Continued\r\n\r\n_Hemming the top of the bag and putting in a running-stitch to provide a\r\nspace for the cord._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nReview of the hemming-stitch and the running-stitch.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe pupils, having the hems basted, should report to the teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe teacher should review briefly the method of making the\r\nhemming-stitch and the running-stitch, asking the pupils to describe\r\nthese stitches and to demonstrate them on the large square of canvas\r\nbefore the class. The basted hems should then be sewed with the\r\nhemming-stitch.\r\n\r\nAfter the hem is finished, the pupils should run a basting thread around\r\nthe bag, to mark the location of the running-stitch, which is to be half\r\nan inch above the hem. They should measure for this carefully. If there\r\nis not time to do all the hemming in the class period, the\r\nhemming-stitch and the running-stitch (which is to provide space for the\r\ndraw-string) should be assigned for outside work, and each pupil should\r\nbring in her finished hem at a designated time before the next class\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VIII: BAGS--Continued\r\n\r\n_Preparing a cord or other draw-string for the bag. Putting a double\r\ndraw-string in the bag, so that it can easily be drawn up. Use of the\r\nbodkin._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 8.--Bag nearly completed]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nTo make a cord, it is necessary to take more than four times as much\r\ncotton as the final length of the cord will require, for some of the\r\nlength will be taken up in the twisting of the cord. It will be easier\r\nfor two to work together in making a cord. The cord should be doubled,\r\nthe two lengths twisted together firmly, and the ends brought together\r\nagain and held in one hand, while the middle is taken in the other hand,\r\nand the lengths are allowed to twist firmly together. The ends should be\r\ntied, and the cord run into the bag with a bodkin or tape-needle. If one\r\ncord is run in from one side and another is run in from the other side,\r\neach cord running all the way around, the bag can be drawn up easily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 9.--Bodkin]\r\n\r\nIn place of the cord, narrow tape may be used. Take two pieces of tape,\r\neach piece being twice as long as the width of the bag plus two inches.\r\nRun one tape in from one side and a second from the other side, each\r\ntape running all the way around. Join the tape ends in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n1. Turn a narrow fold on one end of the tape to the _wrong_ side, and on\r\nthe other end of the tape to the _right_ side.\r\n\r\n2. Slip one fold under the other and hem down the folded edges.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIf the pupils are not able to supply cords for their own bags, the\r\nteacher should have a sufficient supply of cord on hand. She should be\r\nsure the bags are in readiness for the cord before the class period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 10.--- Completed bag]\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe teacher should begin the lesson by describing the method of making\r\nthe cord, estimating the amount necessary, and demonstrating the process\r\nwith the assistance of one of the pupils. The pupils should be numbered,\r\nso that they may work in groups of two. After they have completed the\r\ncord and run it into the bag, methods of finishing the ends neatly\r\nshould be suggested to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON IX: DARNING STOCKINGS\r\n\r\n_Use of a darning-ball or gourd as a substitute for a ball. Talk on the\r\ncare of the feet and the care of the stockings._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 11.--Darning]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nThis lesson will involve running and weaving. Darning is used to fill in\r\na hole with thread, so as to supply the part that has been destroyed or\r\nto strengthen a place which shows signs of weakness. A darning-ball, a\r\ngourd, or a firm piece of cardboard should be placed under the hole. The\r\ndarn should extend one quarter of an inch beyond the edge of the\r\nmaterial, beginning with fine stitches in the material, making rows\r\nrunning close together in one direction, then crossing these threads\r\nwith rows that run at a right angle to them. Care should be taken\r\nalternately to pick up and drop the edge of the material around the\r\nhole, so that no raw edges will be visible, and to weave evenly in and\r\nout of the material and the cross threads.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nEach pupil should provide a pair of stockings with a few small holes and\r\na gourd or ball of some sort that she can use as a darning ball.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nWhen the class meets, the teacher should discuss briefly the care of the\r\nfeet and of the stockings, and demonstrate the method of darning, on a\r\nlarge piece of coarse material, with heavy yarn and a needle. If the\r\npupils finish one darn during the lesson period, more darning should be\r\nassigned for practice out of class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON X: PATCHING[A]\r\n\r\n_Hemmed patches on cotton garments. Talk on the care of the clothes._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nThis lesson will involve measuring, trimming, basting, and hemming. A\r\npatch is a piece of cloth sewed on to a garment to restore the worn\r\npart. The material used for the patch should be as nearly like the\r\noriginal fabric in colour and quality as possible. In placing the patch,\r\nthe condition of the material about the hole must be taken into\r\nconsideration, as well as the size of the hole. The worn parts around\r\nthe hole should be removed, and the hole cut square or oblong. The patch\r\nshould be, on all four sides, an inch larger than the trimmed hole. The\r\ncorners of the hole should be cut back diagonally, so that the edges may\r\nbe turned under. The patch should be matched and pinned to the wrong\r\nside of the garment, leaving the edges to project evenly on all four\r\nsides. The edges of the material around the hole should be turned in and\r\nbasted to the patch. The edges of the patch should be turned in so that\r\nthey extend, when finished, one-half inch from the edge of the hole. The\r\npatch and the cloth should be basted together and hemmed.\r\n\r\n    [A] Used when special problem comes up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 12.--Patching]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe lesson on patching should be given at any time in the course when it\r\ncan be applied to an immediate need. If a pupil tears her dress while\r\nplaying at school, or if she wears a torn apron, the teacher can\r\nannounce a patching lesson for the next sewing class, and request each\r\npupil to bring a torn garment and the material for the patch from home.\r\nIt may be desirable to use two or three periods for this lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe teacher should demonstrate the process of patching on a large piece\r\nof cotton. The pupils should practise placing a patch on a piece of\r\npaper with a hole in it. Each step should be assigned in\r\nsuccession--examination of the article to determine its condition,\r\ncalculation of the size and preparation of the patch, placing the patch,\r\ntrimming the article around the hole, basting the patch and material\r\ntogether, and hemming the patch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XI: CUTTING OUT APRONS OR UNDERGARMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nWhen cutting out an apron, the length of the skirt should first be\r\nmeasured, and to this measure 6 inches should be added for the hem and\r\nthe seams. One length of the material corresponding to this length\r\nshould be cut. This should be folded lengthwise through the middle.\r\nThree quarters of an inch should be measured on this fold, and the\r\nmaterial cut from the end of the selvage to this point, in order to\r\nslope the front of the apron. When the waist measure is taken, 3 inches\r\nshould be added to it (1 for the lap and 1 at each end, for finishing).\r\nThis makes a strong piece at each end for the button and button-hole. Two\r\npieces of this length and 2-1/2 inches wide should be cut lengthwise of\r\nthe material for the belt. A measure should be made from the middle of\r\nthe back of the waist line, over the shoulder, to a point 5 inches to\r\nthe right to the centre front and on the waist line. Two pieces of the\r\nlength of this measure and 4-1/2 inches wide should be cut lengthwise of\r\nthe material for the shoulder straps. A piece 9 by 12 inches should be\r\ncut for the bib, the longer distance lengthwise of the material. These\r\nmeasurements allow one quarter of an inch for seams.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nBefore the lesson the teacher should see if arrangements can be made to\r\nsecure the use of one or two sewing-machines, so that the pupils may sew\r\nall the long seams by machine.\r\n\r\nAt a previous lesson she should discuss the kinds of material suitable\r\nfor the aprons. The pupils should consider whether their aprons shall be\r\nwhite or coloured, and whether they shall be of muslin, cambric, or\r\ngingham. Each pupil will need from 1-1/2 to 2 yards of material,\r\naccording to her size. The taller ones will need 2 yards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 13.--Cutting out skirt of apron]\r\n\r\nThere should be on hand a sufficient number of tape-measures, pins, and\r\nscissors, so that the pupils may proceed with the cutting of their\r\naprons without unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\nThe apron to be made is to have a skirt, with a bib and shoulder straps,\r\nin order to be a protection to the dress, the skirt, and the waist.[A]\r\n\r\n    [A] If the pupils are very inexperienced and find the\r\n    sewing difficult, it may be advisable to omit the bib and\r\n    straps and to make the simple full-skirted apron. If a\r\n    machine is not at hand to use for the long seams, the\r\n    limited time may make the simpler apron necessary. This\r\n    will give more time for the various steps. Lessons XIV and\r\n    XV may then be omitted, Lesson XVI made more simple, and\r\n    less outside work may be required.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nAs soon as the class meets, the pupils should take the measurements for\r\ntheir aprons. One measurement should be assigned at a time, and the\r\nreason for each measurement should be given. The pupils should have\r\nexplicit directions as to the measurements, as they are apt to become\r\nconfused if the directions are not clear. They should work carefully, so\r\nthat the material does not become crumpled or soiled and, at the\r\nconclusion of the lesson, they should fold it carefully and put it away\r\nneatly. All threads and scraps of material should be carefully picked\r\noff the floor and the desks, and the room left in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XII: APRONS OR UNDERGARMENTS--Continued\r\n\r\n_Basting the hem for hemming on the machine or by hand. Uneven basting._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nAn uneven basting forms the better guide for stitching. In uneven\r\nbasting, the spaces are made about three times as long as the stitches.\r\nThe stitch should be about one eighth of an inch and the space three\r\neighths of an inch.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIn addition to the apron material which has been cut out in the previous\r\nlesson, each pupil should provide her own spool of thread (number sixty\r\nwhite thread will probably answer for all the work), a piece of\r\ncardboard 5 inches wide for a gauge, and pins to use in fastening the\r\nhem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 14.--Uneven basting]\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nAs soon as the class meets, the pupils should prepare a 5-inch gauge, to\r\nguide them in turning the hems of the skirts of their aprons. They\r\nshould make a half-inch notch in the measure for the first turn in the\r\nmaterial. A half-inch edge should be turned up from the bottom of the\r\nskirt, then a 5-inch hem should be turned, pinned, and basted carefully\r\nwith uneven basting. The gauge should be used for both measurements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIII: APRONS OR UNDERGARMENTS--Continued\r\n\r\n_Gathering the skirt and stitching to the belt._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nIn gathering, a stitch much like running is employed. Small stitches are\r\ntaken up on the needle, with spaces twice as great between them. The top\r\nof the skirt should be divided into halves, and each half gathered with\r\na long thread, fine stitches one quarter of an inch from the edge being\r\nused. The middle of the belt and the middle of the top of the skirt of\r\nthe apron should be determined upon. The belt should be pinned to the\r\nwrong side of the apron at these points, and the fulness drawn up to fit\r\n(approximately one half of the waist measure). The skirt and the belt\r\nshould be pinned, basted, and sewn together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 15.--Gathering]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIf the hems have been completed in the skirts, the pupils are ready to\r\ngather the skirts and attach them to the belt. It will be well to have a\r\nsupply of pins on hand, to use in fastening the skirt and belt together.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe teacher should first demonstrate the method of gathering and assign\r\nthat portion of the lesson. When the skirts have all been gathered, she\r\nshould show the pupils how to measure, pin, and baste the skirt to the\r\nbelt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 16.--Sewing on the belt of the apron]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIV: APRONS OR UNDERGARMENTS--Continued\r\n\r\n_Making the bib._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nA 2-inch hem should be turned across one short end of the bib. This\r\nshould be basted and hemmed. The bottom of the bib should be gathered,\r\nthe method employed for the top of the skirt being used, and sufficient\r\nthread being left to adjust the gathers easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nIf the pupils have completed the skirts and attached them to the belts,\r\nthey are ready to make the bibs. They should be provided with a 2-inch\r\nmarker, for use in making the hems in the top of the bibs.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe teacher should guide the pupils carefully in the making of the bibs,\r\nreviewing their knowledge of basting, hemming, and gathering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 17.--Bib and straps of apron]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XV: APRONS OR UNDERGARMENTS--Continued\r\n\r\n_Making the straps._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nOne end of one of the straps should be placed at the bottom of the bib.\r\nThe edge of the strap should be pinned, basted, and sewed to the right\r\nside of the bib with a running-stitch. The other long edge of the strap\r\nshould then be turned in one quarter of an inch and the side turned in\r\none inch. The strap should then be folded through the middle for its\r\nentire length and the free side basted to the wrong side of the bib and\r\nhemmed. The remaining edges of the strap should be overhanded together.\r\nThe other strap should be sewn to the other side of the bib in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe bibs should have been completed before the pupils report for this\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nAs soon as the pupils report for the lesson, the teacher should explain\r\nthe method of attaching the straps to the bib and tell them how to\r\nfinish the former. As they proceed with their work, she should supervise\r\nthem carefully and assign the unfinished portion to be done out of\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVI: APRONS OR UNDERGARMENTS--Continued\r\n\r\n_Putting the bib and the skirt on the belt._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nThe middle of the bottom of the bib should be determined, and pinned to\r\nthe middle of the upper edge of the belt, to which the skirt has already\r\nbeen attached. The belt should be fastened to the wrong side of the bib.\r\nThe gathering string of the bib should be drawn up, leaving 2 inches of\r\nfulness on each side of the middle. The bib should be pinned, basted,\r\nand sewn to the belt. The remaining long edges of the belt should be\r\nturned in one quarter of an inch, and the ends one inch. The edges of\r\nthe other belt piece should be turned in in the same way, and should be\r\npinned over the belt to which the skirt and the bib have been attached\r\n(with all the edges turned in), and basted carefully, to keep the edges\r\neven. The skirt and the bib should be hemmed to this upper belt, and all\r\nthe remaining edges should be overhanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThe bib and the straps of the apron should be completed before the\r\npupils report for this lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe teacher should guide the pupils carefully in the various steps\r\nnecessary in fastening the bib to the belt and in completing the belt.\r\nIf the hemming and overhanding is not completed during the class hour,\r\nthey may be assigned as home work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVII: METHODS OF FASTENING GARMENTS\r\n\r\n_Sewing buttons on the aprons, corset-cover, or other garment._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nThis lesson should teach neatness in dress, through a consideration of\r\nthe best methods of fastening garments. The position of the button is\r\nmeasured by drawing the right end of the band one inch over the left\r\nend. The place for the button should be marked with a pin on the left\r\nend of the band. A double thread is fastened on the right side of the\r\nband, drawn through one hole of the button, and back through the other,\r\nand then taken through the band close to the first stitch. A pin should\r\nbe inserted on top of the button under the first stitch, left there\r\nuntil the button is firmly fastened in place, and then removed. Before\r\nthe thread is fastened, it should be wrapped two or three times around\r\nthe threads holding the button, between the button and the cloth, then\r\nfastened neatly on the wrong side with a few small stitches one on top\r\nof another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 18.--Sewing on buttons]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nEach pupil should come to the class with her apron as nearly completed\r\nas possible, and with three buttons to sew on it, for fastening the belt\r\nand straps.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe teacher should discuss the best methods of fastening garments and\r\nshould demonstrate the method of sewing on buttons. The pupils should\r\nsew one button on the left end of the apron band in the middle of the\r\nwidth about 1 inch from the end, and another button 4 inches from each\r\nend of the band, to hold the shoulder straps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVIII: METHODS OF FASTENING GARMENTS--Continued\r\n\r\n_Button-holes on practice piece and on apron._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nDirections for making the button-hole.--Measure carefully the position\r\nfor the button-hole, lengthwise of the band, so that the end will come\r\none quarter of an inch from the edge of the garment. Mark the length of\r\nthe button-hole on the material by putting in two lines of\r\nrunning-stitches at the ends. To cut the button-hole, insert the point\r\nof the scissors at the point marked by the running-stitches nearest the\r\nedge of the garment, and cut carefully along the thread of the material\r\nto the row of stitches marking the length at the other end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  (_a_) Starting the button-hole\r\n  (_b_) The button-hole stitch\r\n  (_c_) The finished button-hole\r\n  _Fig._ 19.--Working button-holes]\r\n\r\nTo make the button-hole, use a thread of sufficient length to do both\r\nthe overcasting and the button-holing. Beginning at the lower right\r\ncorner, overcast the raw edges with stitches one sixteenth of an inch\r\ndeep. Do not overcast around the ends of the hole. As soon as the\r\novercasting is done, proceed with the button-holing without breaking the\r\nthread. Hold the button-hole horizontally over the first finger of the\r\nleft hand and work from right to left. Insert the point of the needle\r\nthrough the button-hole (at the back end), bringing the point through,\r\ntoward you, four or five threads below the edge of the button-hole.\r\nBring the doubled thread from the eye of the needle from right to left\r\nunder and around the point of the needle, draw the needle through, and\r\npull the thread firmly, so that the purl is on the edge. At the end of\r\nthe button-hole, near the end of the band, make a fan, by placing from\r\nfive to seven stitches. The other end of the button-hole should be\r\nfinished with a bar made by taking three stitches across the end of the\r\nbutton-hole, then button-hole over the bar, taking in the cloth\r\nunderneath and pulling the purl toward the slit. The thread should be\r\nfastened carefully on the under side of the button-hole.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nFor this lesson it is desirable to have small pieces of cotton on hand,\r\nto use as practice pieces for the button-holes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe teacher should demonstrate the making of a button-hole, illustrating\r\neach step of the process on a large piece of canvas. The pupils should\r\nsew two small strips of cotton together and cut a button-hole one\r\nquarter of an inch from the edge, and lengthwise of the material, to\r\nwork for practice. When the button-hole has been sufficiently perfected\r\non the practice piece, the pupils should make three in the apron--one in\r\nthe right end of the band and one in the end of each shoulder strap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIX: A PADDED HOLDER FOR HANDLING\r\nHOT DISHES--BINDING\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nA holder 6 inches square will be satisfactory for handling hot dishes.\r\nIt can be made of quilted padding bound with tape, or of two thicknesses\r\nof outing flannel covered with percale or denim and bound with tape or\r\nbraid. If made of the outing flannel and covered, it should be quilted,\r\nby stitching from the middle of one side to the middle of the opposite\r\nside in both directions, in order to hold the outing flannel and the\r\noutside covering together. The tape that is to be used for the binding\r\nshould be folded through the middle lengthwise; then, a beginning being\r\nmade at one corner of the padding, the edge should be basted, half on\r\none side and half on the other. Right-angled corners should be formed.\r\nWhen basted all around, the tape should be sewn on each side with a\r\nhemming-stitch.\r\n\r\nIf the holder is to be suspended from the apron band, a tape of from 27\r\ninches to 36 inches in length should be attached to one corner. The raw\r\nedge at one end of the tape should be turned in. The end should be so\r\nplaced that it overlaps the corner of the holder about half an inch and\r\nit should be basted to the holder. The tape should then be secured\r\nfirmly to the holder, hemmed down on one edge, across the bottom, and up\r\nthe other edge. The other end of the tape should be finished with a\r\n2-inch loop. The raw edge should be folded over, the tape turned 2\r\ninches down for the loop, and basted in place. This should be hemmed\r\nacross the end. One quarter of an inch up from the end, the double\r\nthickness of tape should be back-stitched together, and the edges of the\r\ntape should be overhanded from there to the hemmed end.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nEach pupil should provide sufficient denim, percale, huckaback, or other\r\nwashable material to cover the two sides of a holder 7 inches square,\r\nand enough outing or canton flannel for a double lining. About 1-1/2\r\nyards of straight tape one-half inch wide will be needed for the binding\r\nand for suspending the holder from the apron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 20.--The holder]\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe pupils should first carefully measure and turn the material for the\r\ncovering of the holder and then prepare the lining, basting it all\r\ntogether. They should then put in the running-stitch and finish with the\r\nbinding. If it is not possible to complete the holder in one period, a\r\nsecond lesson period should be provided, or arrangements may be made to\r\nhave supervised work done outside of the lesson hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 21.--Cap]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XX: A CAP TO WEAR WITH THE COOKING APRON\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT-MATTER\r\n\r\nThe simplest cap to make will be the circular one. A pattern should be\r\nmade by drawing with a pencil and string on a piece of wrapping-paper a\r\ncircle 21 inches in diameter. The material for the cap should be cut\r\ncarefully around the circle and finished with a narrow hem. A tape to\r\nhold the draw-string should be placed 1-1/4 inches inside the edge of\r\nthe hem. A small piece of cardboard cut about one-half inch wide should\r\nbe used for measuring the position of the tape. Bias strips three\r\nquarters of an inch wide should be prepared for the tape, or a\r\ncommercial tape three eighths of an inch wide may be purchased. The\r\nouter edge of the tape should be basted first and the edges joined; then\r\nthe inner edges should be basted, the edge being kept smooth. Both edges\r\nshould be neatly sewn with the hemming-stitch by hand or on the machine.\r\nAn elastic should be inserted in the band, carefully fitted to the head,\r\nand the ends fastened neatly.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PLAN\r\n\r\nThis lesson will give a good opportunity to make a cap that will answer\r\nfor a dust cap or serve as a part of the cooking uniform. If such a cap\r\ndoes not seem desirable and the former lesson has not been completed,\r\nthe cap may be omitted and the work on the holder continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF WORK\r\n\r\nThe pupils should first make the pattern for the cap and then cut out\r\ntheir material. The hem should be basted and stitched with the\r\nhemming-stitch. The bias strip should be basted on and sewn with a\r\nrunning-stitch. It will probably not be possible for the pupils to\r\ncomplete the cap in one class period; but, if the material has been cut\r\nout and the work started, they may be able to complete it at some other\r\ntime. The stitches are not new, and the work will serve as an excellent\r\ntest of the skill they have acquired in the course.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD SCIENCE EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Household Science into rural schools has been\r\nhindered by the prevalent impression that the subject requires equipment\r\nsimilar to that in the Household Science centres of towns and cities,\r\nwhere provision is made for the instruction of twenty-four pupils at one\r\ntime and for from ten to fifteen different classes each week. Owing to\r\nthe expense and the lack of accommodation, it is not possible to install\r\nsuch equipment in rural schools. For this and other reasons it has been\r\nconcluded that the subject is beyond the possibilities of the rural\r\nschool. That this is not the case is shown by the fact that many rural\r\nschools in the United States, and some in Saskatchewan, as well as a\r\nnumber in our own Province, are teaching the subject successfully, with\r\nequipment specially designed to meet existing conditions.\r\n\r\nThe accommodations and equipment required may be classified as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Working tables\r\n  2. Cupboards and cabinets for storing the utensils\r\n  3. Stoves\r\n  4. Cooking and serving utensils\r\n\r\n1. The provision for working tables is conditioned by the space\r\navailable, and every effort must be made to economize this space. The\r\nequipment may be placed in the basement or in a small ante-room. In one\r\nschool in the Province very successful work is being done in a large\r\ncorridor. When a new school-house is being erected, provision should be\r\nmade by building a small work-room off the class-room. The possibilities\r\nof a small, portable building, in close proximity to the school, should\r\nnot be overlooked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 22.--Working drawing of folding table]\r\n\r\nWhere the school is provided with a large table, this may be made of\r\nservice. When used as a working table it should be covered with a sheet\r\nof white oil-cloth. When used as a dining-table a white table-cloth may\r\nbe substituted for the oil-cloth. If the school does not possess a\r\ntable, two or three boards may be placed on trestles, if the space at\r\nthe front or the back of the room permits, and these may be stored away\r\nwhen not required. A table with folding legs, such as is shown in\r\nFigures 22 and 23, may also be used. The top of the cabinet containing\r\nthe utensils or an ordinary kitchen table closed in as a cupboard\r\nunderneath, may be made to serve. Long boards, about eighteen inches\r\nwide, placed across the tops of six or eight desks, provide good\r\naccommodation. These should be blocked up level and should be provided\r\nwith cleats at each end, in order to prevent movement. When not in use\r\nthey may stand flat against the wall and occupy very little space.\r\nSeparate boards, resting on a desk at each end, may also be placed\r\nacross the aisles. Each of these will provide working space for one\r\npupil. Tables which drop down flat when not in use may be fixed to the\r\nwalls of the school-room. As schools vary in many respects, it is not\r\npossible to outline a plan which will suit all; but that plan should be\r\nchosen which will best meet the requirements of the particular school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 23: Folding Table]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 24--Household Science Cabinet for Rural Schools]\r\n\r\n2. The cupboards and cabinets to contain the utensils may take various\r\nforms. A kitchen cabinet costing from twenty-five to thirty-five dollars\r\nmay be obtained from a furniture store, or one may be made by a local\r\ncarpenter. A large packing-case painted brown outside and white inside\r\n(for cleanliness) is satisfactorily used in some schools. If covered\r\nwith oil-cloth, the top of this may be used as an additional table. A\r\nfew shelves placed across a corner of the room and covered with a door\r\nor curtain may be used, or it may be possible to devote one shelf of the\r\nschool cupboard to the storing of the utensils. It is desirable to have\r\na combination cupboard and table, which will contain most of the\r\nequipment, including the stove. Figure 24 is a working drawing of such a\r\ncabinet, which may be made by a local carpenter or by the older boys of\r\nthe school.\r\n\r\nThe directions for making this cabinet are as follows:\r\n\r\nObtain two boxes and cut or re-make them so that each is 30 inches high\r\nwhen standing on end, 12-1/4 inches across the front inside, and 18\r\ninches from front to back. These will form the two end Sections, A and\r\nB. Inside the sides of these boxes nail 1 inch \xc3\x97 7/8 inch strips, to\r\nform the slides for the drawer. The slides come within 7/8 of an inch of\r\nthe front edge. Rails may be nailed across the front. Guide pieces\r\nshould be nailed to the slides, in order to keep the drawers straight.\r\nDivide Section A for one drawer and cupboard. The drawers may be made\r\nout of raisin boxes cut down to the required size. To the front of each\r\ndrawer, nail a piece of beaver board or pine a little larger than the\r\ndrawer front. Use any handles that may be conveniently obtained. Cut two\r\npieces 4\' 9-1/2" \xc3\x97 1-1/2" \xc3\x97 7/8". Space the Sections as shown, and nail\r\nthese pieces firmly to the fronts of the larger boxes, _A_ and _B_, top\r\nand bottom. Four end pieces 18" \xc3\x97 1-1/2" will be required. Fill in\r\nSection _C_, in this case, 2\' 7-1/2", with the pieces from the box lids\r\nor with ordinary flooring. Make a door for the cupboard from similar\r\nmaterial. The top is best made from good, clear, white pine. Screw\r\nbattens across, and screw the whole firmly to the box top from the\r\ninside. If more table space is required, make a similar bench top, which\r\ncan rest on top of the cabinet when not in use. When required, it may be\r\nplaced over the desks. Steel or glass shoes or wooden skids or battens\r\nshould be fixed under the cabinet, so that it can be pulled away from\r\nthe stove and replaced easily. The dimensions given are for a\r\ntwo-flame-burner oil-stove which is 30 inches high, 31 inches across the\r\nfront, and 16 inches from front to back. The middle Section, _C_, and\r\nthe total height of the cabinet may be enlarged or reduced to fit other\r\nsizes of stoves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 25.--Cabinet, showing stove in position for use]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 26.--Cabinet, with stove behind centre partition\r\nwhen not in use]\r\n\r\nThe material required for, and the approximate cost of, such a cabinet,\r\nlabour not included, are as follows:\r\n\r\n  2 boxes @ 25                              $0.50\r\n  5 raisin boxes @ 5                          .25\r\n  5 handles at 45c per doz.                   .20\r\n  1 cupboard latch                            .15\r\n    or 1 turn button                          .02\r\n  About 9 sq. ft. flooring                    .25\r\n  About 8 sq. ft. pine for top                .50\r\n    Pieces for battens, etc.                  .25\r\n    Steel shoes                               .10\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 27.--Space taken by equipment in class-room]\r\n\r\nFigure 27 shows another type of equipment and the space it occupies in\r\nthe class-room when not in use. The cupboard and the back of the cabinet\r\ncontain the equipment necessary for teaching twelve pupils at one time\r\nand also for serving one hot dish at the noon lunch to twenty-four\r\npupils. One drawer contains linen, etc., and the other, knives, forks,\r\nand spoons. The dimensions of the cupboard and the cabinet are shown in\r\nFigures 28 and 29, and the construction of each is such that it can be\r\nmade easily by any carpenter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 28.--Working drawings of cupboard]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 29.--Working drawing of cabinet]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 30.--Cupboard with drawers and doors open, showing\r\nequipment]\r\n\r\nFigure 30 shows the cupboard and drawers open and the method of storing\r\nthe equipment. The shelves may be covered with white oil-cloth or brown\r\npaper, in order to obviate the necessity for frequent scrubbing. The\r\ncupboard may be fixed to the wall with mirror plates or small iron\r\nbrackets, or it may be screwed through the back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 31.--Back of cabinet with equipment in place]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 32.--Back of cabinet with stove removed]\r\n\r\nFigure 31 shows the back of the cabinet, with the three-flame-burner\r\nstove-oven, the one-flame-burner stove, and other utensils in place. The\r\nfolding table, previously described, rests on the top of the cabinet.\r\nFigure 32 shows the back of the cabinet with the stove and oven removed.\r\nThe method of storing utensils and the construction of the cabinet are\r\nclearly shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 33.--Three-flame-burner oil-stove, with kettles\r\nand one-flame-burner oil-stove on shelf]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 34.--Household Science equipment with drop-leaf\r\ntable]\r\n\r\nFigure 33 shows the three-flame-burner oil-stove with the shelf\r\nunderneath containing three kettles and the one-flame-burner oil-stove.\r\n\r\nAnother type of equipment is shown in Figure 34. Each end of the top of\r\nthis cabinet drops down when the cupboard doors are closed, space being\r\nthus economized. The top of the table may be covered with oil-cloth or\r\nzinc carefully tacked down on the edges.\r\n\r\nThe directions for making this cabinet are as follows:\r\n\r\nMATERIALS

up\r\naccording to the directions previously given.\r\n\r\n  1. Frame; rip the 1" \xc3\x97 8" \xc3\x97 12\' piece for the frame material\r\n  2. Bottom\r\n  3. Ends and sides\r\n  4. Shelves\r\n  5. Top\r\n  6. Casing\r\n  7. Doors\r\n  8. Swing tops\r\n  9. Miscellaneous pieces\r\n\r\nII Assembling--\r\n\r\nFrame:\r\n\r\n1. Check up the dimensions of the pieces squared up for the frame.\r\n\r\n2. Lay out and cut the lap joints in the top side rails and frame posts,\r\nas shown in the drawing.\r\n\r\n3. Nail the frame together.\r\n\r\n4. Test the corners of the frame with a steel try-square and brace it by\r\nnailing, temporarily, several strips diagonally across the corners.\r\n\r\nBottom:\r\n\r\n1. Cut seven pieces of flooring 32-1/2" long for the bottom and plane\r\noff the groove of one piece.\r\n\r\n2. Turn the frame upside down and nail this piece with the smooth edge\r\nprojecting 7/8" over the front side of the frame. Nail the rest of the\r\nflooring so that each piece matches tightly.\r\n\r\nEnds:\r\n\r\n1. For the back, cut eleven pieces of ceiling 31-1/4" long.\r\n\r\n2. Plane off the groove edge of one piece of ceiling and nail it on the\r\nback of the frame even with the end. 3. Nail the rest of the ceiling on\r\nthe back. Be sure that each joint matches tightly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 35.--Frame of cabinet nailed together]\r\n\r\nShelves:\r\n\r\n1. Make four strips (3/4" \xc3\x97 3/4" \xc3\x97 16-1/2") and nail two of them inside,\r\nacross each end, 15" and 24" from the bottom. These strips hold the\r\nshelves.\r\n\r\n2. From a 1" \xc3\x97 12" piece cut two pieces 32-1/2" long; fit and\r\nnail them in for the upper shelf.\r\n\r\n3. Make the bottom shelf of two pieces, one 10-1/4" wide and the other\r\n8" wide. When these boards are nailed in place, the shelf is narrow\r\nenough to allow the doors, with pockets on, to close.\r\n\r\n4. Make two strips; one 13-16" \xc3\x97 1" \xc3\x97 16-1/2" and the other 13-16" \xc3\x97\r\n1-3/4" \xc3\x97 20-1/2", and nail them to the top shelf for drawer guides.\r\n\r\nTop:\r\n\r\n1. Cut eight pieces of flooring 36" long for the top.\r\n\r\n2. Plane off the groove of one piece and nail it on the top of the\r\nframe, so that the smooth edge and the ends project 1" over the front\r\nside and ends of the cabinet.\r\n\r\n3. Nail the rest of the flooring on for the top, being sure that each\r\njoint matches tightly. The last piece must also project 1" over the back\r\nside.\r\n\r\nCasing:\r\n\r\n1. Nail the casing, which is 1-3/4" wide, on the front of the cabinet.\r\n\r\nDoors:\r\n\r\n1. Make each door 3/4" \xc3\x97 14-3/8" \xc3\x97 22-7/8" from five pieces of ceiling\r\n22-7/8" long, held together by cleats at the top and bottom.\r\n\r\n2. Fit each door carefully, then hang them with butt hinges. Fasten a\r\ncupboard catch on each door.\r\n\r\nDrop Door:\r\n\r\n1. Make the drop door 13-16" \xc3\x97 14-3/8" and hinge it with a pair of butt\r\nhinges. Put on the stopper chain and catch. Swing Tops:\r\n\r\nThe swing tops are each made from six pieces of flooring 24" long\r\ncleated together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 36.--Working details]\r\n\r\n1. Plane off the groove edge of one piece and match them all together.\r\n\r\n2. Make the cleats 3/4" \xc3\x97 2" \xc3\x97 15" and nail the top to them. (See the\r\ndrawing for the position of the cleats.)\r\n\r\n3. Rip off the tongue edge and plane it so that the top is exactly 18"\r\nwide.\r\n\r\n4. Turn the cabinet upside down on the floor and fit the swing tops.\r\nHang them with a pair of butt hinges opposite the ends of the cleats.\r\n\r\n5. Make a T-brace with a nailed cross lap joint from two pieces, one\r\nbeing 13-16" \xc3\x97 2" \xc3\x97 14", the other 13-16" \xc3\x97 2" \xc3\x97 16-1/2". The long edge\r\nof the T and the leg must be bevelled 13-16" on one side. Fit and hang a\r\nT-brace with a pair of butt hinges on each side of the swing tops.\r\n\r\n6. Make two brace cleats and fasten them to the ends of the cabinet, so\r\nthat the swing tops are held level and even with the top of the cabinet.\r\n\r\nPutting Zinc on the Top:\r\n\r\n1. Unscrew the swing tops from the cabinet to put the zinc on.\r\n\r\n2. Place the piece of zinc, 27" \xc3\x97 39", on top, extending 1-1/2" over the\r\nedges all around.\r\n\r\n3. Hold the zinc firmly in place and make a square bend along the front\r\nedge with a hammer or mallet, bending the edge of the zinc up under the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\n4. Punch a straight row of holes 1" apart through the zinc and tack it\r\non.\r\n\r\n5. Bend the back edge, punch and tack in the same manner as the front\r\nedge, but be sure the zinc fits snugly on the top.\r\n\r\n6. Bend the ends of the zinc the same as before, but be very careful to\r\nfold the corners neatly.\r\n\r\n7. Put the zinc on the swing tops in the same manner.\r\n\r\n8. Fasten the swing tops again to the top of the cabinet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 37.--Working details]\r\n\r\n\r\nDrawer:\r\n\r\nThe drawer front, 13-16" \xc3\x97 5" \xc3\x97 14-3/8", with lap 3/8" \xc3\x97 1/2" cut out on\r\nthe ends.\r\n\r\n1. Nail the sides, 1/2" \xc3\x97 5" \xc3\x97 19-5/8", to the lap of the front and to\r\nthe ends of the back.\r\n\r\n2. Nail the bottom in between the sides 1/8" from the lower edge. This\r\nallows the drawer to slide on the edges of the sides.\r\n\r\n3. Put the partitions in the drawer as called for by this plan.\r\n\r\nThe racks for covers and pie tins shown in the drawings are made from\r\ntwo pieces, 13-16" \xc3\x97 2" \xc3\x97 4", one piece 13-16" \xc3\x97 2" \xc3\x97 10-1/2" for the\r\nbottom, and two pieces of lath 12" long for the sides. These racks may\r\nbe placed on the doors as shown, or may be changed to suit the\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII Finishing--\r\n\r\n1. Set all the nails and putty the holes.\r\n\r\n2. Sandpaper the cabinet carefully.\r\n\r\n3. Paint or stain and wax the outside of the cabinet, to harmonize with\r\nthe surroundings where it is to be used.\r\n\r\n4. Paint the inside with two coats of white enamel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 38.--Cabinet completed]\r\n\r\nBefore putting on the enamel, apply a coat of ordinary white-lead paint\r\nand allow it to dry thoroughly. If desired, the outside of the cabinet\r\nmay be finished in white enamel, though this is somewhat more expensive\r\nthan the paint or stain recommended above.\r\n\r\nAll the Household Science Cabinets shown have a two-fold purpose. In the\r\nfirst place, they furnish storage space for the utensils and working\r\nspace for the pupils. In the second place, they offer a most interesting\r\nmanual training project for a boys\' club. The members can make any one\r\nof them, thus correlating their practical woodwork and the domestic\r\nscience of the girls and, in this way, exhibiting the co-operative\r\nspirit of the home and the school.\r\n\r\n3. In some cases it may be possible to use the school stove for cooking\r\npurposes. Some schools use natural gas for heating and, where this is\r\nthe case, provision for cooking may readily be made. Other schools\r\nsituated on a hydro-electric line, may, as has been done in one case,\r\nuse electricity as a source of heat. At present, however, the majority\r\nof schools may find it best to use one of the many oil-stoves now on the\r\nmarket. One-, two-, or three-flame-burner stoves may be obtained for\r\ngeneral use. The two-, or three-flame-burner stoves are recommended, as\r\nthey are less likely to be overturned. The one-flame-burner stove,\r\nhowever, is often useful as an additional provision. A good grade of oil\r\nshould be used, and the stove should be kept scrupulously clean,\r\nconstant attention being paid to the condition of the wick. Any oil\r\nspilt on the stove when it is being filled should be carefully wiped off\r\nbefore lighting. If attention is paid to these details, the stove will\r\nburn without any perceptible odour.\r\n\r\n4. The number of the utensils and the amount of equipment depend upon\r\nthe community and the number of pupils to be considered. By careful\r\nplanning few utensils are needed. They should be as good as the people\r\nof the neighbourhood can afford and, in general, should be of the same\r\ncharacter as those used in the homes of the district. All the\r\ntable-cloths, towels, dish-cloths, etc., required should be hemmed by\r\nthe pupils. Articles for storing supplies may be bought or donated.\r\nGlass canisters with close lids are best, but as substitutes, fruit\r\njars, jelly glasses, or tin cans will serve the purpose. It is an easy\r\nmatter to secure an empty lard-bucket or a syrup-can for flour or meal,\r\nempty coffee-cans for sugar or starch, etc., and baking-powder or\r\ncocoa-tins for spices. Each should be plainly labelled.\r\n\r\nSeveral typical lists of equipment in Household Science are given here.\r\nThese may be modified to suit particular circumstances. Considerable\r\nexpense may be saved if the pupils bring their own individual\r\nequipment--soup-bowl, cup and saucer, plate, spoon, knife, fork, and\r\npaper napkins. This plan is not advised unless it is absolutely\r\nnecessary, but, if followed, an effort should be made to have the\r\narticles as uniform as possible.\r\n\r\nThe following equipment is that contained in the cabinet illustrated on\r\npage 152 and is sufficient for giving organized instruction to six\r\npupils. If a noon lunch is provided, additional individual equipment\r\nwill be required.\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT FOR RURAL SCHOOL HOUSEHOLD SCIENCE\r\nCABINET--NO. 1\r\n\r\n   1 Perfection blue-flame stove (two-flame)           $15.00\r\n   1 Two-burner oven                                     4.50\r\n   1 Coal-oil can                                         .50\r\n   1 Dish-pan                                            1.15\r\n   1 Tea-kettle                                          1.50\r\n   1 Large sauce-pan and cover                            .75\r\n   2 Medium sauce-pans and covers, 30c each               .60\r\n   2 Small sauce-pans and covers, 25c each                .50\r\n   2 Frying-pans, 20c ea.                                 .40\r\n   2 Pudding bake-dishes, 50c ea.                        1.00\r\n   2 Muffin pans (12 rings, each 30c)                     .60\r\n   1 Soap-dish                                            .25\r\n   4 Small mixing bowls, 16c ea.                          .64\r\n   2 Pitchers, 55c ea.                                   1.10\r\n   3 Casseroles, 20c, 25c, 30c                            .75\r\n   6 Measuring cups, 90c ea.                              .60\r\n   6 Custard cups, 90c doz.                               .45\r\n   6 White plates, $1.45 doz.                             .73\r\n   6 Supply jars, 90c doz.                                .45\r\n   2 Vegetable brushes, 5c ea.                            .10\r\n   1 Grater                                               .20\r\n   2 Egg-beaters, 10c ea.                                 .20\r\n  12 Forks                                               2.25\r\n  12 Teaspoons                                           1.20\r\n   6 Tablespoons, $2.85 doz.                             1.43\r\n   6 Vegetable knives, 25c ea.                           1.50\r\n   6 Case knives, $3.00 doz.                             1.50\r\n   2 Strainers, 20c ea.                                   .40\r\n   1 Spatula                                              .40\r\n   1 Bread knife                                          .50\r\n   1 Can-opener                                           .10\r\n   1 French knife                                         .45\r\n   2 Water pails, $1.15 ea.                              2.30\r\n   6 Dish-towels, 25c ea.                                1.50\r\n   3 Dish-cloths, 10c ea.                                 .30\r\n   3 Rinsing cloths, 10c ea.                              .30\r\n   1 yd. oil-cloth                                        .45\r\n   5 yards cheesecloth                                    .35\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT FOR RURAL SCHOOL HOUSEHOLD SCIENCE CABINET--NO.

of the second large stove. In this case\r\nextra provision must be made for storing the stoves when not in use, as\r\nthe cabinet shown does not provide space for more than one large stove.\r\nCare should be taken in using the one-burner stove to avoid upsetting it\r\nwhile it is in use. The equipment given above is generous, and\r\nreductions may be made if necessary. In any case it is not advisable\r\nthat the whole equipment should be purchased at once; only sufficient to\r\nmake a beginning should be secured, and further utensils may be added as\r\nthe necessity for their use arises.\r\n\r\nIf a hot dish is served at the noon lunch, as is most desirable, the\r\nfollowing will be needed in addition, in order to serve twenty-four\r\npupils:\r\n\r\n  24 Knives                              $2.40\r\n  24 Forks                                1.20\r\n  24 Teaspoons                             .40\r\n  12 Tablespoons                           .60\r\n  6 Salt and pepper shakers               1.50\r\n  24 Glasses                              1.50\r\n  24 Plates                               2.20\r\n  4 Plates (large)                         .50\r\n  24 Cups and saucers                     4.20\r\n  24 Fruit and vegetable dishes           1.50\r\n\r\n\r\nHECTOGRAPH\r\n\r\nThe hectograph is a device for making copies of written work. Teachers\r\nwhose schools have limited black-board space will find it of great\r\nservice. Recipes and other rules for work may be copied and distributed\r\nto the pupils, and thus kept in a permanent form. Many other uses in\r\nconnection with the general work of the school will suggest themselves.\r\n\r\nThe following are the directions for making:\r\n\r\nSoak 1-1/2 ounces of white glue in three ounces of water until it is\r\nwell softened. Cook in a double boiler until the whole mass is smooth.\r\nRemove from the fire and add six ounces of glycerine. Mix well, re-heat,\r\nskim, and pour into a shallow pan or on a slate. Prick the bubbles as\r\nsoon as they show. Allow the mixture to stand for twenty-four hours, and\r\nit is then ready for use.\r\n\r\nWrite the material to be copied, in hectograph ink, on a sheet of the\r\nsame size as that on which the copy is to be made. Write clearly and\r\nspace carefully. Wipe the hectograph with a damp cloth. Lay a sheet of\r\nunglazed paper on the hectograph, rub it carefully, and take off at\r\nonce. This removes any drops of water, but leaves the surface moist. Lay\r\nthe written side of the sheet on the hectograph and rub it carefully\r\nover its whole surface with a soft cloth, so that every particle of the\r\nwriting comes in contact with the surface of the hectograph. Leave it\r\nthere for four or five minutes. Lift one corner and peel off carefully.\r\nLay a plain sheet on the hectograph and rub as before. Take off as\r\nbefore. If the copy is not clear, leave the next sheet on a little\r\nlonger. When sufficient copies have been made, wash the hectograph with\r\na wet cloth before putting it away. Keep in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RURAL SCHOOL LUNCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best method of approach to Household Science in the rural school is\r\nthrough the medium of the hot noon-day lunch or the preparation of one\r\nor two hot dishes to supplement the lunch brought from home. Owing to\r\nthe fact that many pupils live far from the school, it is impossible for\r\nthem to go home for the mid-day meal, and they are thus dependent upon\r\nlunches which they bring with them. Very frequently the pupils are\r\nallowed to eat their lunches where and how they please, and the method\r\nchosen is conducive neither to comfort nor to health. In fine weather\r\nthey do not wish to lose any time from their games, and so they eat\r\ntheir food while playing, or they bolt it, in order that they may get to\r\ntheir play more quickly. In severe weather they crowd round the steps or\r\nthe stove and do not hesitate to scatter crumbs and crusts. In one case\r\neven a teacher has been seen holding a sandwich in one hand and writing\r\non the black-board with the other.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the lunch does not attract the pupil. It is often carried,\r\nwithout proper wrapping, in a tin pail, and it then absorbs the taste of\r\nthe tin; again, it is often wrapped in a newspaper and is flavoured with\r\nprinter\'s ink; occasionally, it is wrapped in cloth not too clean.\r\nConditions such as these are not fair to the pupils. They come a long\r\nway to school, often over poor roads; and it is necessary, for both\r\ntheir physical and their mental development, that they should receive\r\nadequate nourishment served as attractively as possible. Many of the\r\ndefects found among school children can be traced, to a greater or less\r\nextent, to lack of nutrition. The United States military draft shows\r\nthat the number of those physically defective is from seven to twenty\r\nper cent. higher in rural districts than in towns and cities, and this\r\ndifference is not peculiar to that country. May we not reasonably\r\nsuppose that many of these defects are caused by mal-nutrition, and that\r\nthis mal-nutrition is in part due to the poor noon-day lunch? As these\r\ndefects hinder mental as well as physical development, the question of\r\nproper nutrition through the medium of the school lunch becomes an\r\neducational one.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOX LUNCH\r\n\r\nWith proper care in the selection of food, the packing of the lunch box,\r\nand rational methods of consumption, there is no reason why the box\r\nlunch should not be nourishing, attractive, and possess an educational\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIt may be laid down as an axiom that every school lunch should be\r\nsupervised by the teacher and hap-hazard methods of eating the lunch\r\nshould be prohibited. Those schools that are fortunate enough to possess\r\na large table can approximate somewhat to the best home conditions, and\r\nhave the table set in the proper manner, as shown in Lesson VI, page 18.\r\nThe pupils should sit round the table, at the head of which is the\r\nteacher, and the lunch may be made to partake of the nature of a family\r\nparty. If rightly managed, the meal, even under the unusual difficulties\r\npresented in the rural school, may offer the most favourable\r\nopportunities to inculcate habits of cleanliness and neatness and to\r\ncultivate good manners. The pupils will learn something about the proper\r\nselection of food and the importance of thorough mastication. Clean\r\nhands and faces and tidy hair should be insisted upon, and individual\r\ndrinking cups should be encouraged. As a manual training exercise, each\r\npupil may be taught to make his own drinking cup from heavy waxed paper.\r\nGrace may be said by the older pupils in turn.\r\n\r\nThe table should be made to look as attractive as possible. The pupils,\r\nin turn, might undertake to have the table-cloth washed at home or, in\r\nplace of a linen cloth, a covering of white oil-cloth may be used. In\r\nsome cases the school garden will be able to supply flowers or a growing\r\nplant for a centrepiece. Three or four of the larger pupils, either boys\r\nor girls, may set the table in ten minutes, while the others are washing\r\ntheir hands and faces and tidying their hair. Some such plan as this\r\nwill add palatability and cheer to the monotony of the everyday cold and\r\noften unattractive lunch and will create a spirit of true and healthy\r\nsociability among the pupils.\r\n\r\nIn schools that do not possess tables large enough to be used as\r\nsuggested above, each pupil should be required to set one place at his\r\nown desk, as shown in the illustration on page 20. A paper napkin may be\r\nused for a table-cloth, if a small piece of white oil-cloth is not\r\nprocurable. Each pupil retains his place until all have finished; he\r\nshould then dispose of the crumbs and leave his desk tidy. From twenty\r\nminutes to half an hour is generally found sufficient for the meal.\r\nThere should be cheerful conversation and restrained laughter throughout\r\nthe meal, and acts of courtesy and generosity should be encouraged. At\r\nseasons when there are no flies, and on days when the weather is\r\nfavourable, it is a pleasant change to serve lunch out-of-doors.\r\n\r\nThe lunch is provided by the home, but the teacher may give some useful\r\nlessons in Household Science by talks on the contents of the lunch box\r\nand the proper methods of packing the same, so that the food will keep\r\nin good condition until the time for its consumption arrives. It is the\r\nduty of the school authorities to provide a suitable storage place for\r\nthe lunch boxes. These boxes should be kept free from dust or flies and\r\nin a place where the food will not freeze in winter. Open shelves, so\r\noften seen, are not suitable and a properly ventilated cupboard in the\r\nschool-room should be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF THE LUNCH BOX\r\n\r\nThe whole question of the box lunch presents a serious problem, when we\r\nconsider the large number of children who must depend upon it for their\r\nnoon-day meal. This meal should be so constituted as to make it a real\r\nmeal and not a makeshift. The same principles which govern the\r\npreparation of the meal should govern the preparation of the lunch box.\r\nIt is said that the school lunch should consist of "something starchy\r\nand something meaty, something fat and something fibrous, something\r\nsweet and something savoury".\r\n\r\nWith so many varieties of breads, meats, cheese, jams, etc., innumerable\r\nkinds of sandwiches may be made. For example, there are brown, graham,\r\nrye, raisin, nut, and date breads, and equally many kinds of meat. Such\r\nvariety makes it quite unnecessary to have an egg sandwich or\r\nhard-boiled eggs in the lunch box each day. While eggs are very valuable\r\nin the diet, a lunch with hard-boiled eggs five times each week becomes\r\nmonotonous, and the appetite of the consumer flags. With skill and\r\nthought one can make little scraps of meat or other "left-overs" into\r\nattractive sandwiches. Ends of meat, ground and mixed with salad\r\ndressing or cream, make delicious sandwich fillings.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDWICH MAKING\r\n\r\nThe bread should be cut evenly.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the slice should vary with the appetite of the\r\n  consumer.\r\n\r\nThe crust should not be removed.\r\n\r\nThe butter should be creamed for spreading.\r\n\r\nBoth slices should be buttered, in order to prevent the absorption of\r\n  the filling.\r\n\r\nThe filling should be carefully placed between the slices.\r\n\r\nThe sandwiches should be wrapped in waxed paper, to prevent drying.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR SANDWICH FILLING\r\n\r\n1. Egg and ham:\r\n\r\n    Three eggs hard boiled and chopped fine or ground\r\n    An equal amount of chopped or boiled ham\r\n    Salad dressing\r\n    Mix and spread.\r\n\r\n2. Raisin filling:\r\n\r\n    One cup of raisins ground or chopped\r\n    One half-cup of water\r\n    One half-cup of sugar\r\n    One tablespoonful of flour into the same quantity of vinegar\r\n    Juice and grated rind of one lemon\r\n    Cook in a double boiler until thick.\r\n\r\n3. Fig filling:\r\n\r\n    Remove the stems and chop the figs fine.\r\n    Add a small quantity of water.\r\n    Cook in a double boiler until a paste is formed.\r\n    Add a few drops of lemon juice.\r\n    Chopped peanuts may be added.\r\n\r\n4. Egg:\r\n\r\n    Chop a hard-cooked egg.\r\n    Mix with salad dressing or melted butter, to a\r\n      spreading consistency.\r\n\r\n5. Equal parts of finely-cut nuts and grated cheese,\r\n      with salad dressing\r\n\r\n6. Equal parts of grated cheese and chopped olives\r\n\r\n7. Sardines with lemon juice or a little dressing\r\n\r\n8. Chopped dates with a little cream. Nuts may be added.\r\n\r\n9. Thinly sliced tomatoes (seasonal)\r\n\r\n10. Sliced cucumbers\r\n\r\n11. Marmalade. Chopped nuts may be added.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR PLANNING\r\n\r\nIn selecting the food the following suggestions may prove helpful:\r\n\r\n_Protein_--Sandwiches of fish, meat, egg, cheese, nuts, dish of cottage\r\n   cheese\r\n\r\n  For the older pupils, baked beans\r\n\r\n_Carbohydrates_--Bread, cake, cookies, jam, honey, dates, figs, raisins,\r\n  prunes, candy\r\n\r\n_Fats_--Butter, cream, peanut-butter\r\n\r\n_Mineral matter_--Celery, lettuce, radish, tomatoes; fresh fruits\r\n\r\n    _Note._--When possible, a bottle of clean sweet milk\r\n    should form part of every lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR DESSERTS\r\n\r\nCup custards of various flavours\r\n\r\nCookies with nuts and fruits\r\n\r\nCakes--not too rich\r\n\r\nPies well made and with good filling\r\n\r\nCandy--plain home-made\r\n\r\nPreserves\r\n\r\nCanned fruits\r\n\r\nFresh fruits\r\n\r\nAs often as possible, a surprise should be included, generally in the\r\nform of a dessert of which the pupil is fond. A surprise adds to the\r\npupil\'s pleasure in eating and, indirectly, aids digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACKING THE LUNCH BOX\r\n\r\nMuch of the attractiveness of a lunch depends upon the manner of\r\npacking. We must consider the fact that the foods must be packed\r\ntogether closely and must remain so packed for several hours. This makes\r\ncareful packing a necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES FOR PACKING\r\n\r\n1. Be sure that the box is absolutely clean.\r\n2. Line it with fresh paper every time it is used.\r\n3. Wrap each article of food in wax paper.\r\n4. Place in the box neatly, the food that is to be used last in the\r\n     bottom of the box, unless it is easily crushed.\r\n5. Lay a neatly folded napkin on the top.\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT FOR PACKING\r\n\r\n  Lunch box\r\n  Waxed paper\r\n  Paper napkin\r\n  Cup or container with screw top\r\n  Drinking cup\r\n  Knife, fork, and spoon\r\n  Thermos bottle or jar for milk or other liquid\r\n\r\nThe box itself should be of odourless material, permanent, and light in\r\nweight, admitting of safe means of ventilation. Paper bags should never\r\nbe used for food containers, as it is impossible to pack the lunch in\r\nthem firmly and well and there is danger of their being torn or of\r\ninsects or flies creeping into them. Boxes of fibre, tin, basket weave,\r\nor other material, may be used. The box will require scrubbing, and\r\nshould be frequently dried and aired well. Many types of lunch boxes\r\nhave compartments provided for the various kinds of food.\r\n\r\nWaxed paper and paper napkins, or the somewhat heavier paper towels of\r\nmuch the same size, are very useful for packing lunches, and may be\r\nobtained at a low price, particularly if bought in large quantities. An\r\nextra napkin, either of paper or cloth, should be put in the basket, to\r\nbe spread over the school desk when the lunch is eaten. Napkins can be\r\nmade out of cotton crepe at a cost of a very few cents each. The crepe\r\nmay be bought by the yard and should be cut into squares and fringed.\r\nSuch napkins have the advantage of not needing to be ironed.\r\n\r\nPaper cups, jelly tumblers with covers which can now be bought in\r\nseveral sizes, and bottles with screw tops, such as those in which candy\r\nand other foods are sold, may all be used for packing jellies, jams,\r\nhoney, etc. The thermos bottle may be used for carrying milk, or, if\r\nthis is too expensive, a glass jar with a tight cover may be\r\nsubstituted. If the thermos bottle is used, hot drinks may also be\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERVING A HOT DISH\r\n\r\nThe serving of a hot lunch or of one hot dish need be neither an\r\nelaborate nor an expensive matter. Many rural schools in the United\r\nStates, some of them working under conditions worse than any of ours,\r\nare serving at least one hot dish to supplement the lunch brought from\r\nhome. The advantages of this plan are:\r\n\r\n1. It enables the pupils to do better work in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n2. It adds interest to the school work and makes the pupils more ready\r\n     to go to school in bad weather.\r\n\r\n3. It gives some practical training and paves the way toward definite\r\n     instruction in Household Science.\r\n\r\n4. It gives a better balance to meals, and as compared with a cold lunch\r\n     it aids digestion.\r\n\r\n5. It teaches neatness.\r\n\r\n6. It gives opportunity to teach table manners.\r\n\r\n7. It strengthens the relationship between the home and the school.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METHOD\r\n\r\nThe teacher should have a meeting of the school trustees and of the\r\nmothers of the pupils and outline the method of procedure. It is only in\r\nthis way that the co-operation of all can be secured, and without this\r\nco-operation there can be no success. This meeting should be addressed\r\nby the Public School Inspector; and after the consent of the parents and\r\nthe trustees has been secured, the scheme may be put into operation.\r\nSome thought will have to be given to the organization, in order that\r\nthe plan may work smoothly. If properly organized, there need be little\r\nor no interruption to the ordinary routine of the school.\r\n\r\nThe pupils, both boys and girls, should be arranged in groups, each\r\ngroup taking the work in turn. Even the smallest pupils should be\r\nallowed to take part, as there are many duties which they can perform\r\nsuccessfully. If each group is composed of five or six pupils, the work\r\nmay be arranged as follows: two will prepare the dish, two will get the\r\ntable or the desks ready (or each pupil may prepare his own desk), and\r\nthe others will wash the dishes.\r\n\r\nThe furnishing of supplies is a problem which each teacher will have to\r\nsolve for herself, according to the conditions which exist in the\r\ncommunity. Supplies which can be stored are best purchased by the school\r\ntrustees; while the mothers of the pupils should furnish the perishable\r\narticles, such as milk and butter. As often as possible, the pupils may\r\nbe asked to bring various articles, such as a potato, an apple, a\r\ncarrot, an egg, etc. These may be combined and prepared in quantities.\r\nThe school garden should be relied upon to supply many vegetables in\r\nseason, thus adding interest and life to both the garden work and the\r\nlunch. In some districts the neighbourhood is canvassed for\r\nsubscriptions in order to provide funds to purchase supplies for the\r\nterm lunches. Some schools give a concert or entertainment in order to\r\nraise funds for this purpose, and in others all the supplies have been\r\npurchased by the school trustees.\r\n\r\nThe pupils who are to prepare the hot dish may make the necessary\r\npreparations before school or at recess, and they must so time the\r\ncooking that the dish will be ready when required. They should be\r\nallowed to leave their desks during school hours to give it attention if\r\nnecessary. In schools where this method is adopted, it has been found\r\nthat the privilege has never been abused, nor have the other pupils been\r\nless attentive on account of it. However, most of the recipes suggested\r\nlater require little or no attention while cooking.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\'clock the assigned pupils get the dish ready for serving and\r\nset the table. The others wash their hands, tidy their hair, and get\r\ntheir lunch boxes. All pass to their places. The pupils who have\r\nprepared the dish may serve it, using trays to carry each pupil\'s\r\nsupply, or the pupils may pass in line before the serving table and to\r\ntheir places, time being thus saved. When the meal is finished, the\r\npupils rise and bring their dishes to the serving table and stack them\r\nwith the other dishes. Two remain behind to clear up and wash the\r\ndishes, while the others go to play. If the desks are used, each pupil\r\nis responsible for leaving his own desk clean.\r\n\r\nThe pupils may be required to keep an account of the cost of the food\r\nand to calculate the cost per head per day or per week. A schedule of\r\nthe market prices of food should be posted in a conspicuous place, and\r\nthe pupils may take turns in keeping these prices up to date. A separate\r\nblack-board may be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe dish chosen should be as simple as possible--a vegetable or cream\r\nsoup, cocoa, baked potatoes, baked apples, white sauce with potatoes or\r\nother vegetables, apple sauce, rice pudding, etc. It may be well, in\r\nsome cases, to have plans made on Friday for the following week. As a\r\nrule, each day a little before or after four o\'clock, the recipe for the\r\nfollowing day should be discussed, the quantities worked out to suit the\r\nnumber of pupils, and the supplies arranged for. The element of surprise\r\nshould be made use of occasionally, the pupils not being allowed to know\r\nthe dish until they take their places.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTED MENUS\r\n\r\nThe following are some suggested menus in which the food brought from\r\nhome is supplemented by one hot dish.

The number that the recipe will serve is generally\r\nstated and, where this number does not coincide with the number of\r\npupils in any particular school, the quantities required may be obtained\r\nby division or multiplication. The recipes given in the lessons on\r\ncooking may also be used in preparing the school lunch, as each recipe\r\nstates the number it will serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White Sauce_\r\n\r\n  1 c. milk\r\n  2 tbsp. flour\r\n  1/2 tbsp. butter\r\n  1/4 tsp. salt\r\n  1/8 tsp. white pepper\r\n\r\nReserve one quarter of the milk and scald the remainder in a double\r\nboiler. Mix the flour to a smooth paste with an equal quantity of the\r\ncold milk and thin it with the remainder. Stir this gradually into the\r\nhot milk and keep stirring until it thickens. Add the butter, salt, and\r\npepper, and cover closely until required, stirring occasionally. This\r\nrecipe makes a sauce of medium consistency. To make a thick white sauce,\r\nuse 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of flour to one cup of milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cocoa_\r\n\r\n  6 tbsp. (18 tsp.) cocoa\r\n  6 tbsp. (18 tsp.) sugar\r\n  6 c. milk\r\n  6 c. boiling water\r\n  1/2 tsp. salt\r\n\r\nScald the milk in a double boiler. Mix the cocoa, sugar, and salt, then\r\nstir in the boiling water and boil for 3 minutes. Add this mixture to\r\nthe scalded milk. If a scum forms, beat with a Dover egg-beater for one\r\nminute. The preparation should begin at half-past eleven, to have the\r\ncocoa ready at twelve o\'clock. (Will serve eighteen.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potato Soup_\r\n\r\n  1 qt. peeled potatoes cut\r\n  in thin slices\r\n  3 qt. milk\r\n  2 tsp. salt\r\n  4 tsp. butter\r\n  4 tbsp. flour\r\n  1/8 tsp. black pepper\r\n  1 small onion\r\n  1/2 tsp. celery seed or a stock of celery\r\n\r\nBefore the opening of school, the potatoes should be pared and put into\r\ncold water; and the butter, flour, salt, and pepper should be thoroughly\r\nmixed. At eleven o\'clock, the potatoes, onion, and celery should be put\r\non to boil gently and the milk put into a double boiler to heat. When\r\nthe vegetables are tender, they should be strained with the cooking\r\nliquid into the hot milk and the mixture bound with the flour. The soup\r\nshould be closely covered until required. (Will serve ten.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cream of Pea Soup_\r\n\r\n  1 can peas or 1 qt. fresh peas\r\n  1 pt. milk\r\n  2 tbsp. butter\r\n  2 tbsp. flour\r\n  1 tsp. salt\r\n  1/4 tsp. pepper\r\n\r\nHeat the peas in their own water, or cook them in boiling salted water\r\nuntil tender. Put the milk to heat in a double boiler. When the peas are\r\ntender, rub them, with the cooking liquid, through a strainer into the\r\nscalded milk. Add the butter and flour rubbed to a smooth paste and stir\r\nuntil thickened. Season and cover until required. (Will serve six pupils\r\ngenerously.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cream of Tomato Soup_\r\n\r\n  1 pt. or 1 can tomatoes\r\n  2 tbsp. butter\r\n  3 tbsp. flour\r\n  1 tsp. sugar\r\n  1 qt. milk\r\n  Sprig of parsley\r\n  1/4 tsp. white pepper\r\n  1/2 tsp. soda\r\n  1 tsp. salt\r\n\r\nCook the tomatoes slowly with the seasonings for ten minutes and rub\r\nthrough a strainer. Scald the milk, thicken with the flour and butter\r\nrubbed to a paste, re-heat the tomatoes, and add the soda, mix with the\r\nmilk, and serve at once. (Will serve six pupils generously.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cream of Corn Soup_\r\n\r\n  2 pt. cans corn\r\n  1 pt. cold water\r\n  2 slices onion\r\n  2 qt. of thin white sauce Seasonings\r\n\r\nThe process is that used in making Cream of Pea Soup. When making the\r\nthin white sauce, place the onion in the milk and leave it until the\r\nmilk is scalded. Then remove the onion to the other mixture and make the\r\nsauce. This gives sufficient onion flavour. (Will serve eighteen.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lima-bean Soup_\r\n\r\n  1 c. Lima beans\r\n  2 qt. water\r\n  2 whole cloves\r\n  1 bay leaf\r\n  1 tsp. salt\r\n  3 tbsp. butter\r\n  2 tbsp. flour\r\n  3 tbsp. minced onion\r\n  1 tbsp.   "    carrot\r\n  1 tbsp.   "    celery\r\n  1/4 tsp. pepper\r\n\r\nSoak the beans overnight in soft water or in hard water which has been\r\nboiled and cooled. If cold, hard water is used, add 1/4 tsp. baking-soda\r\nto 1 qt. of water. In the morning, drain and put on to cook in 2 qt. of\r\nwater. Simmer until tender. It takes 2 hours. Cook the minced vegetables\r\nin the butter for 20 minutes, being careful not to brown them. Drain out\r\nthe vegetables and put them into the soup. Put the flour and butter into\r\na pan and stir until smooth. Add this mixture to the soup. Add the\r\ncloves, bay leaf, and seasonings, and simmer for 1 hour. Rub through a\r\nsieve. One cup of milk may be added. Bring to the simmering point and\r\nserve. (Will serve eighteen.)\r\n\r\n    _Note._--If desired, the vegetables may be used without\r\n    browning and the cloves and bay leaf omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Milk and Cheese Soup_\r\n\r\n  4 c. milk\r\n  2 tbsp. flour\r\n  1-1/3 c. grated cheese\r\n  Salt and pepper to taste\r\n\r\nThicken the milk with flour, cooking thoroughly.

(Will serve six.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cream of Rice Soup_\r\n\r\n  4 tbsp. rice\r\n  4 c. milk\r\n  3 tbsp. butter\r\n  1/2 small onion\r\n  4 stalks celery\r\n  1/2 bay leaf\r\n  Salt and pepper to taste\r\n\r\nScald the milk, add the well-washed rice, and cook for 30 minutes in a\r\nclosely covered double boiler. Melt the butter and cook the sliced onion\r\nand celery in it until tender, but not brown. Add these, with the bay\r\nleaf, to the contents of the double boiler, cover, and let it stand on\r\nthe back of the stove for 15 minutes. Strain, season with salt and\r\npepper, re-heat, and serve. Note that the bay leaf is added and allowed\r\nto stand, to increase the flavour, and may be omitted if desired. (Will\r\nserve six.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rice Pudding_\r\n\r\n  3 c. rice\r\n  6 c. water\r\n  6 c. milk\r\n  2 c. sugar\r\n  4 eggs\r\n  2 tsp. salt\r\n  3 c. fruit (chopped raisins) if desired\r\n\r\nWash the rice in a strainer placed over a bowl of cold water, by rubbing\r\nthe rice between the fingers. Lift the strainer from the bowl and change\r\nthe water. Repeat until the water is clear. Put the water in the upper\r\npart of a double boiler directly over the fire, and when it boils\r\nrapidly, gradually add the rice to it. Boil rapidly for 5 minutes, then\r\nadd the milk, to which has been added the sugar, salt, and eggs slightly\r\nbeaten. Cover, place in the lower part of the double boiler, and cook\r\nuntil kernels are tender--from 45 minutes to 1 hour. If raisins are\r\nused, add them before putting the rice in the double boiler. Serve with\r\nmilk and sugar as desired. (Will serve eighteen.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rice Pudding_\r\n\r\n  2 c. rice\r\n  1 c. raisins\r\n  1 tsp. salt\r\n  4 qt. milk\r\n  1 c. sugar\r\n  1 tsp. cinnamon\r\n\r\nPrepare the rice and raisins and put them, with the other ingredients,\r\nin a buttered pan.

Serve hot. (Will serve six.)\r\n\r\n    _Note._--Dried bread crumbs may be used in place of the\r\n    crackers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Candied Fruit Peel_\r\n\r\nThe candied peel of oranges, lemons, grapefruit, and other fruits makes\r\na good sweet which is economical, because it utilizes materials which\r\nmight otherwise be thrown away. Its preparation makes an interesting\r\nschool exercise. The skins can be kept in good condition for a long time\r\nin salt water, which makes it possible to wait until a large supply is\r\non hand before candying them. They should be washed in clear water,\r\nafter removing from the salt water, boiled until tender, cut into small\r\npieces, and then boiled in a thick sugar syrup until they are\r\ntransparent. They should then be lifted from the syrup and allowed to\r\ncool in such a way that the superfluous syrup will run off. Finally,\r\nthey should be rolled in pulverized or granulated sugar.\r\n\r\nA large number of recipes have been given, in order that a selection may\r\nbe made according to season, community conditions, and market prices,\r\nand so that sufficient variety may be secured from day to day.\r\n\r\nAttention given to this matter will be well repaid by the improved\r\nhealth of the pupils, the greater interest taken in the school by the\r\nparents, and the better afternoon work accomplished. It has been well\r\nsaid: "The school lunch is not a departure from the principle of the\r\nobligation assumed by educational authorities toward the child, but an\r\nintensive application of the measures adopted for the physical nurture\r\nof the child, to the end of securing in adult years the highest\r\nefficiency of the citizen".\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL BULLETINS\r\n\r\n_The Rural School Luncheon_: Department of Education, Saskatchewan\r\n\r\n_The Box Luncheon_: New York State College of Agriculture,\r\n   Cornell University\r\n\r\n_Hints to Housewives_: Issued by Mayor Mitchell\'s Food Supply\r\n   Committee, New York City\r\n\r\n_Home Economics in Village and Rural Schools_: Kansas State\r\n   Agricultural College\r\n\r\n_Home-made Fireless Cookers and Their Use_: Farmers\' Bulletin,\r\n   United States Department of Agriculture\r\n\r\n_Hot Lunches for Rural Schools_: Parts I and II, Iowa State\r\n   College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts\r\n\r\n_Rural School Lunches_: University of Idaho, Agricultural Extension\r\n    Department\r\n\r\n_The Rural School Lunch_: University of Illinois College of Agriculture\r\n\r\n_The School Luncheon_: Oregon Agricultural College\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD SCIENCE WITHOUT SCHOOL EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nThere is no school so unhappily situated or so poorly equipped that it\r\nis unable to teach effectively the lessons previously outlined in the\r\n"Care of the Home" and "Sewing". Now that a grant in aid is provided by\r\nthe Department of Education any rural school may procure one of the sets\r\nof equipment for cooking suggested or some modification thereof. As a\r\nstepping-stone to the provision of that equipment and as a means of\r\neducating the people of the district in regard to the advantages of\r\nteaching this branch of Household Science, it may be advisable or even\r\nnecessary, in some cases, to attempt practical work, even where no\r\nequipment is installed by the school authorities.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the present position of Manual Training and\r\nHousehold Science in urban schools is entirely owing to private\r\ninitiative and demonstration, by which the people were shown how and why\r\nthese subjects should be included in the curriculum of the schools. It\r\nis reasonable to suppose that the same results will follow if somewhat\r\nthe same methods are tried in the case of the rural schools, which form\r\nsuch a large part of our educational system. Two methods of giving\r\ninstruction of this character have, in the United States, been followed\r\nby successful results.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST METHOD\r\n\r\nIn the first of these, the teacher spends the last thirty or forty\r\nminutes, generally on Friday afternoons, in the description and\r\ndiscussion of some practical cooking problem which may be performed in\r\nthe homes of the pupils. Before this plan is adopted, it should be\r\ndiscussed with the pupils who are to take the work. They should be\r\nrequired to promise that they will practise at home; and the consent and\r\nco-operation of the parents should be secured, as the success of this\r\nhome work depends, in the first place, on the willingness of the pupil\r\nto accept responsibility, and, in the second place, on the honest and\r\nhearty co-operation of the parents.\r\n\r\nA meeting of the mothers should be called, in order that the plan may be\r\nlaid before them and their suggestions received. At this meeting\r\nafternoon tea might be served. The teacher should plan the lessons, but\r\noccasionally, particularly at festive seasons, the pupils themselves\r\nshould be allowed to decide what shall be made. When it is possible, the\r\nfood prepared at home should be brought by the pupil to the school, in\r\norder that it may be compared with that made by other pupils and be\r\njudged by the teacher. In other cases, the mother might be asked to fill\r\nup a previously prepared form, certifying to the amount and character of\r\nthe work done at home by the pupil each week.\r\n\r\nThe instructions placed on the black-board should be clear and concise\r\nand give adequate information concerning materials, quantities, and\r\nmethods. They should be arranged in such a way as to appeal to the eye\r\nand thus assist the memory. Connected composition should not be\r\nattempted, but the matter should be arranged in a series of numbered\r\nsteps, somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recipe: Boiled Carrots_\r\n\r\n  Carrots\r\n  Boiling water\r\n  Salt and pepper\r\n  Butter\r\n\r\n1. Scrub, scrape, and rinse the carrots.\r\n\r\n2. Cut them into pieces by dicing them.\r\n\r\n3. Place the pieces in a sauce-pan.\r\n\r\n4. Set over the fire and cover with boiling water.\r\n\r\n5. Cook until the pieces are soft at the centre when pierced with a\r\n     fork.\r\n\r\n6. Serve in a hot vegetable dish.\r\n\r\nAfter being thoroughly explained, these directions are placed in a\r\nnote-book, for the guidance of the pupil in her home practice. In some\r\ncases, the directions are placed on properly punched cards, so that at\r\nthe end of the year every pupil will have a collection of useful recipes\r\nand plans, each one of which she understands and has worked out. In many\r\nlessons of this type demonstrations may be given by the teacher and, if\r\nthe food cannot be cooked on the school stove, it may be taken home to\r\nbe cooked by one of the pupils.\r\n\r\nLessons given according to this method, by which the theory is given in\r\nschool and the practice acquired at home, need not be restricted to\r\ncookery. Any of the lessons prescribed in the curriculum for Form III,\r\nJunior, may be treated in the same way. Lessons on the daily care of a\r\nbed-room, weekly sweeping, care and cleaning of metals, washing dishes,\r\nwashing clothes, ironing a blouse and, in fact, on all subjects\r\npertaining to the general care and management of the home, may be given\r\nin this way.\r\n\r\nEach lesson should conclude with a carefully prepared black-board\r\nsummary, which should be neatly copied into the note-books, to be\r\nperiodically examined by the teacher. The black-board work of many\r\nteachers leaves much to be desired, and time spent in improving this\r\nwill be well repaid. Examples of summaries of the kind referred to are\r\nto be found in the Ontario Teachers\' Manual on _Household Management_.\r\nThese instructions may be type-written or hectographed by the teacher\r\nand given to the pupils, thus saving the time spent in note-taking.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND METHOD\r\n\r\nThe second of the plans referred to is a modification of what is known\r\nas the "Crete" plan of Household Science, so called from the name of the\r\nplace in Nebraska, U.S.A., where it was first put into operation. By\r\nthis plan, definite instruction is given in the home kitchens of certain\r\nwomen in the district, under the supervision of the educational\r\nauthorities. It was adopted, at first, in connection with the high\r\nschools of the small towns in that State but, with certain\r\nmodifications, it is suitable to our rural school conditions.\r\n\r\nIn every community there are women who are known to be skilful in\r\ncertain lines of cookery, and the plan makes use of such women for\r\ngiving the required instruction. They become actually a part of the\r\nstaff of the school, giving instruction in Household Science, and using\r\nthe resources of their households as an integral part of the school\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nIn order to put this plan into operation, a meeting of women interested\r\nin the school should be called and if, after the plan has been laid\r\nbefore them and fully discussed, enough women are willing to open their\r\nhomes and act as instructors, then it is safe to proceed. The subjects\r\nshould be divided, and a scheme somewhat as follows may be arranged:\r\n\r\n  Mrs. A. bread and biscuits\r\n  Mrs. B. pies and cakes\r\n  Mrs. C. canning and preserving\r\n  Mrs. D. gems and corn bread\r\n  Mrs. E. desserts and salads\r\n  Mrs. F. cookies and doughnuts\r\n  Mrs. G. vegetables.\r\n\r\nSix has been found a convenient number for a class, though ten is\r\nbetter, if the homes can accommodate that number. Half-past three is a\r\ngood time for the classes to meet, as they then may be concluded by five\r\no\'clock, thus leaving the housewife free to prepare her evening meal.\r\nThe day of the week should be chosen to suit the convenience of the\r\ninstructor. The classes may meet once a week.\r\n\r\nArriving at the home of the instructor at half-past three, the pupils\r\nare seated in the most convenient room, and the lesson is given. During\r\nthis talk the pupils are given not only the recipe, but details as to\r\nmaterials, the preparation thereof, the degree of heat required, the\r\ncommon causes of failure and, in fact, everything that in the mind of a\r\npractical cook would be helpful to the class. Notes are taken, and\r\nafterwards properly written out and examined by the teacher of the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe instructors prepare the food for cooking, and sometimes, as in the\r\ncase of rolls and so on, they cook the food in the presence of the\r\npupils. When white bread is to be baked, the pupils are asked to call, a\r\nfew minutes after school, at the home of the instructor, to watch the\r\nfirst step--setting the sponge--and again the next morning before school\r\nto see the next step--mixing the bread--and again, about half-past\r\neleven or twelve, to see the bread ready for the oven and, finally, on\r\nthe way back to school, to see the result--a fine loaf of well-cooked\r\nbread. The pupils try the recipe carefully in their own homes, not\r\nvarying its terms until they are able to make the dish successfully.\r\nWhen they can do this, they are free to experiment with modifications,\r\nand there should be no objection to receiving help from any source; in\r\nfact, it is a good thing for the daughter to get her mother to criticize\r\nher and offer suggestions in the many little details familiar to every\r\nhousekeeper, but which cannot always be given by an instructor in one\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nBy this method the pupils learn in their own homes and handle real\r\ncooking utensils on a real stove heated by the usual fire of that home.\r\nIf it is a good thing--and no one doubts it--to learn Household Science\r\nin a school where everything that invention and skill can provide for\r\nthe pupils is readily at hand, is it not worth while to enter the field\r\nof actual life and, with cruder implements, win a fair degree of\r\nsuccess?\r\n\r\nAt the end of five or six months, after the pupils have had an\r\nopportunity to become skilful in making some of the dishes which have\r\nbeen taught, it may be well to have an exhibition of their work. Each\r\npupil may, on Saturday afternoon, bring one or more of the dishes she\r\nhas learned to prepare to the school-house, where they may be arranged\r\non tables for the inspection of the judges. The dishes exhibited should\r\nbe certified to as being the work of the pupil with no help or\r\nsuggestion from anybody. Of course, work of this kind cannot be\r\nundertaken by the "suit case" teacher. The teacher who packs her bag on\r\nFriday at noon, carries it to school with her, and rushes to catch a\r\ntrain or car at four o\'clock, not returning to the district until Monday\r\nmorning, has no time for this kind of service.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the entire class may meet with their instructors in the\r\nschool-room. An oil-stove and the necessary equipment may be obtained,\r\nand a demonstration may be given by one of the instructors. By this\r\nmeans much valuable instruction will be given that is not included in\r\nthe regular course. At this time also many things may be discussed that\r\npertain to the growth of the movement and the general well-being of the\r\npupils.\r\n\r\nThe plan is flexible and may be modified easily to suit different\r\nlocalities. It calls for no outlay on the part of the school trustees;\r\nnor are the instructors necessarily put to any expense, as the articles\r\nprepared in giving the lessons may be used in their own homes.\r\n\r\nBy the adoption of one of the plans outlined, or such modifications of\r\nthem as the peculiar requirements of the district may demand, every\r\nrural school may do something, not only toward giving a real knowledge\r\nof some phases of Household Science, but also toward developing the\r\ncommunity spirit and arousing an interest in the school, which will\r\nbenefit all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRELESS COOKER\r\n\r\nAt the present time there is urgent need for thrift and economy in all\r\nthat pertains to the management of the household--particularly in food\r\nand fuel. In the average home much fuel could be saved by the proper use\r\nof what is known as the fireless cooker. The scientific principle\r\napplied has long been known and is, briefly, as follows: If a hot body\r\nis protected by a suitable covering, the heat in it will be retained for\r\na long time, instead of being lost by radiation or conduction. This is\r\nwhy a cosy is placed over a tea-pot.\r\n\r\nIn using a fireless cooker, the food is first heated on the stove until\r\nthe cooking has begun, and then it is placed in the fireless cooker--a\r\ntight receptacle in which the food is completely surrounded by some\r\ninsulating substance to prevent the rapid escape of the heat, which in\r\nthis way is retained in the food in sufficient quantity to complete the\r\ncooking. Sometimes, when a higher cooking temperature is desired, an\r\nadditional source of heat, in the form of a hot soapstone or brick or an\r\niron plate such as a stove lid, is put into the cooker with the food.\r\n\r\nThe same principle is also employed in cookery in other ways. For\r\nexample, in camp life beans are often baked by burying the pots\r\novernight in hot stones and ashes, the whole being covered with earth;\r\nand in the "clam bakes" on the Atlantic Coast, the damp seaweed spread\r\nover the embers on the clams prevents the escape of the heat during\r\ncooking. The peasants in some parts of Europe are said to begin the\r\ncooking of their dinners and then to put them into hay boxes or between\r\nfeather beds, so that the cooking may be completed while the family is\r\nabsent in the fields.\r\n\r\nThe chief advantages in the use of the fireless\r\ncooker are these:\r\n\r\n1. It saves fuel, especially where gas, oil, or electric stoves are\r\nused. Where coal or wood is the fuel, the fire in the range is often\r\nkept up most of the day, and the saving of fuel is not so great. In\r\nsummer, or when the kitchen fire is not needed for heating purposes, the\r\ndinner can be started in the stove early in the morning, and then placed\r\nin the fireless cooker, the fire in the range being allowed to go out.\r\nDuring the hot weather, the use of a kerosene or other liquid-fuel stove\r\nand a fireless cooker is a great convenience, since it not only\r\naccomplishes a saving in fuel, but helps to keep the kitchen cooler. The\r\nsaving in fuel resulting from the use of a fireless cooker is greatest\r\nin the preparation of foods such as stews, which require long and slow\r\ncooking.\r\n\r\n2. It saves time. Foods cooked in this way do not require watching, and\r\nmay be left, without danger from fires or of over-cooking, while other\r\nduties are being performed or the family is away from home.\r\n\r\n3. It conserves the flavour of the food and makes it easier to utilize\r\nthe cheaper cuts of meat which, although not having so fine a texture or\r\nflavour, are fully as nutritious, pound for pound, as the more expensive\r\ncuts. Long cooking at a relatively low temperature, such as is given to\r\nfoods in the fireless cooker, improves the flavour and texture of these\r\ntougher cuts of meat. Most people do not cook cereals long enough. By\r\nthis method, the cereal may be prepared at night, cooked on the stove\r\nfor about fifteen minutes, and then put in the fireless cooker. In the\r\nmorning it will be cooked and ready to be served.\r\n\r\nThe fireless cooker may be used to advantage in preparing the following:\r\nsoups; pot roasts; beef stew; Irish stew; lamb stew; corned beef and\r\ncabbage; boiled ham; baked beans; chicken fricassee; vegetables, such as\r\nturnips, carrots, parsnips, beets; dried vegetables, such as peas and\r\nbeans; and dried fruits, such as peaches, apples, apricots, and prunes;\r\ncereals; and puddings.\r\n\r\nThe fireless cookers described in the following pages are not\r\nexperiments. They have all been tested and found to be most practical.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR FIRELESS COOKER--NO. I\r\n\r\nWhile there are many good fireless cookers on the market which cost from\r\nfive to twenty-two dollars, according to size and make, it is possible\r\nto construct a home-made cooker which will give very satisfactory\r\nresults and will be considerably cheaper than one which is purchased in\r\nthe shops.\r\n\r\nMaterials required: A box or some other outside container; some good\r\ninsulating or packing material; an inside container for the kettle, or a\r\nlining for the nest in which the kettle is placed; a kettle for holding\r\nthe food; and a cushion, or pad, of insulating material, to cover the\r\ntop of the kettle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OUTSIDE CONTAINER\r\n\r\nFor the outside container a tightly built wooden box, such as that shown\r\nin Figure 39, is satisfactory. The walls should be thick and of some\r\nnon-conducting material. An old trunk, a small barrel, or a large butter\r\nor lard firkin or tin will serve the purpose. Another possibility is a\r\ngalvanized iron bucket with a closely fitting cover (this has the\r\nadvantage of being fire-proof). A shoe box 15 by 15 by 28 inches is\r\nconvenient in size, since it may be divided into two compartments. It\r\nshould have a hinged cover and, at the front, a hook and staple, or\r\nsome other device to hold down the cover tightly; an ordinary clamp\r\nwindow fastener answers this purpose very well. The size of the\r\ncontainer, which depends upon the size of the kettle used, should be\r\nlarge enough to allow for at least four inches of packing material all\r\nround the nest in which the kettle is placed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 39.--Completed fireless cooker]\r\n\r\nTHE INSULATING MATERIAL\r\n\r\nFor packing or insulating material a variety of substances may be used.\r\nAsbestos and mineral wool are the best, and have the additional\r\nadvantage that they cannot burn. Ground cork (used in packing Malaga\r\ngrapes), hay, excelsior, Spanish moss, wool, and crumpled paper may also\r\nbe used satisfactorily. Of these materials crumpled paper is probably\r\nthe best, as it is clean and odourless and, if properly packed, will\r\nhold the heat better than the others. It is wise to line the box with\r\none thickness of heavy paper or with several thicknesses of newspaper,\r\nto make it as air-tight as possible. Asbestos sheeting may be used\r\ninstead. To pack the container with paper, crush single sheets of\r\nnewspaper between the hands and pack a layer at least four inches deep\r\nover the bottom of the outside container, pounding it in with a heavy\r\nstick of wood.\r\n\r\nPlace the inside container for the cooking kettle or the lining for the\r\ninside of the nest in the centre of this layer, and pack more crushed\r\npaper about it as solidly as possible. The method of packing with paper\r\nis shown in Figure 40. If other material is used it should be packed in\r\na similar way.\r\n\r\nWhere an extra source of heat is to be used, it is much safer to use\r\nsome non-inflammable material such as asbestos or mineral wool. A cheap\r\nsubstitute and one which is easily obtained are the small cinders sifted\r\nfrom coal ashes, preferably those from soft coal. However, the cinders\r\nfrom hard coal burned in the kitchen range will do. If a fire-proof\r\npacking material is not used, a heavy pad of asbestos should be placed\r\nat the bottom of the metal lining, and a sheet or two of this paper\r\nshould be placed between the lining of the nest and the packing\r\nmaterial. Whatever is used should come to the top of the inside\r\ncontainer, and the box should be filled to within about four inches of\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 40.--Fireless cooker, showing method of packing\r\nwith paper]\r\n\r\nTHE INSIDE CONTAINER\r\n\r\nThe inside container for the cooking kettle or the lining for the nest\r\nin which it is to be placed should be cylindrical in shape, should be\r\ndeep enough to hold the cooking kettle and stone, if one is used, and\r\nshould fit as snugly as possible to the cooking kettle, but at the same\r\ntime should allow the latter to be moved in and out freely. For this\r\npurpose a galvanized iron or other metal bucket may be used, or, better\r\nstill, a tinsmith may make a lining of galvanized iron or zinc which can\r\nbe provided with a rim to cover the packing material, as shown in Figure\r\n41. In case no hot stone or plate is to be used, the lining may be made\r\nof strong cardboard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 41.--Metal lining with rim]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KETTLE\r\n\r\nThe kettle to be used for cooking should be durable and free from seams\r\nor crevices which are hard to clean. It should have perpendicular sides,\r\nand the cover should be as flat as possible and be provided with a deep\r\nlid fitting well down into the kettle, in order to retain the steam. A\r\nkettle holding about six quarts is a convenient size for general use.\r\nTinned iron kettles should not be used in a fireless cooker, for,\r\nalthough cheap, they are very apt to rust from the confined moisture.\r\nEnamelware kettles are satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRA SOURCE OF HEAT\r\n\r\nFireless cookers are adapted to a much wider range of cooking if they\r\nare provided with an extra source of heat in the form of a soapstone,\r\nbrick, or an iron plate which is heated and placed underneath the\r\ncooking kettle. This introduces a possible danger from fire, in case the\r\nhot stove plate should come into direct contact with inflammable packing\r\nmaterial such as excelsior or paper. To avoid this danger, a metal\r\nlining must be provided for the nest in which the cooking vessels and\r\nstone are to be placed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 42.--Tightly fitting lid]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOVERING PAD\r\n\r\nA cushion, or pad, must be provided, to fill completely the space\r\nbetween the top of the packing material and the cover of the box after\r\nthe kettle is in place. This should be made of some heavy goods, such as\r\ndenim, and stuffed with cotton, crumpled paper, or excelsior. Hay may be\r\nused, but it will be found more or less odorous. Figure 43 shows the\r\nvertical cross-section of a home-made fireless cooker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 43.--Vertical cross-section of fireless cooker. A.\r\nOutside container; B. packing or insulating material; C. metal lining of\r\nnest; D. cooking kettle; E. soapstone plate, or other source of heat; F.\r\npad of excelsior for covering top; G. hinged cover of outside\r\ncontainer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR FIRELESS COOKER--NO. II\r\n\r\n(Single Cooker)\r\n\r\nMaterials required: Galvanized iron can, No. 3, with a cover; some\r\nsawdust; a covered agate pail (to be used as a cooking pail); and two\r\nyards of denim; any old linen, cotton, or woollen material may be used\r\ninstead of denim.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF MAKING\r\n\r\nPlace loose sawdust in the bottom of the can to a depth of about three\r\ninches. Measure the depth of the cooking pail. Turn a fold two inches\r\ngreater than this depth the entire length of the denim or other material\r\nand make a long bag. Lay the bag flat on the table and fill it with an\r\neven layer of sawdust, so that when completed it will still be half an\r\ninch wider than the depth of the pail. Roll the bag around the cooking\r\npail, so that a smooth, firm nest is formed when the bag is placed\r\nupright in the can on the top of the sawdust. From the remaining denim\r\nor other material make a round, flat bag (the material will have to be\r\npieced for this). Fill this bag with sawdust and use it on top of the\r\ncooking pail. The bags must be made and fitted into the can in such a\r\nway that there will be no open spaces whatever between the sides of the\r\ncooking pail and the can, or between the top of the cooking pail and the\r\ncover of the can, through which the heat might escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR FIRELESS COOKER--NO. III\r\n\r\n(Double Cooker)\r\n\r\nMaterials required: One long box and two square boxes; the long box must\r\nbe large enough to hold the other two and still leave two inches of\r\nspace all around them; five and one-quarter yards of sheet asbestos one\r\nyard wide; two covered agate pails to be used as cooking pails; and\r\nabout one yard of denim or other material.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF MAKING\r\n\r\nLine the bottoms and sides of all three boxes with sheet asbestos. In\r\nthe bottom of the long box lay newspapers flat to a depth of about half\r\nan inch. Put two inches of sawdust on top of this layer of newspapers.\r\nPlace the two square boxes inside the long one, leaving at least two\r\ninches of space between them. Fill all the spaces between the boxes with\r\nsawdust. Tack strips of denim or other material so that they will cover\r\nall the spaces that are filled with sawdust.\r\n\r\nThe outside box must have a hinged lid, which must be fastened down with\r\na clasp. Line the lid with the sheet asbestos to within half an inch of\r\nthe edge. Put a layer of sawdust one inch deep on top of the asbestos.\r\nTack a piece of denim or other material over the sawdust, still leaving\r\nthe edge free and clear so that the cover may fit tightly; or the lid\r\nmay be lined with asbestos and a denim pillow filled with sawdust made\r\nto fit tightly into the top of the box.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE FIRELESS COOKER IN THE PREPARATION OF LUNCHES\r\n\r\nThe fireless cooker should prove very useful in the lunch equipment of\r\nrural schools, as its use should mean economy of fuel, utensils, time,\r\nand effort. It might be made by the pupils and would afford an excellent\r\nmanual training exercise.\r\n\r\nMany of the dishes in the recipes given may be cooked in this way, but\r\nmore time must be allowed for cooking, as there is a fall of temperature\r\nin placing the food in the cooker. When the vessel is being transferred\r\nfrom the stove to the cooker, the latter should be in a convenient\r\nposition, and the transfer should be made, and the cushion placed in\r\nposition, very quickly, so that the food will continue boiling. If the\r\nquantity of food is small, it should be placed in a smaller tightly\r\ncovered pail, set on an inverted pan in the larger pail, and surrounded\r\nwith boiling water. When there is an air space above the food in the\r\ncooking dish, there is greater loss of heat, as air gives off heat more\r\nreadily than water.\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of the foods that may be cooked in a Fireless\r\nCooker:\r\n\r\nApple sauce--Bring to boiling temperature and place in the cooker, leave\r\n  two hours.\r\n\r\nApple compote--Cut the apples in halves or quarters so that they need\r\n  not be turned. Leave them in the cooker about three hours.\r\n\r\nDried fruits--Soak overnight, bring to the boiling-point, and leave in\r\n  the cooker at least three hours.\r\n\r\nCream of wheat--Boil until thick, place in the cooker, leave overnight\r\n  and, if necessary, re-heat in double boiler before using.\r\n\r\nRolled oats--Boil five minutes, then place in the cooker. Leave at least\r\n  three hours and longer if possible.\r\n\r\nMacaroni--Boil, then place in the cooker for two hours.\r\n\r\nRice--Boil, then place in the cooker for one hour.\r\n\r\nAll vegetables may be cooked in the cooker. They must be given time\r\naccording to their age. A safe rule for all green vegetables is to allow\r\ntwo and a half times as long as if boiled on the stove.\r\n\r\nIn the home, where the cooking is much greater in amount than it can be\r\nin the school, the saving in fuel, by the judicious use of the properly\r\nmade fireless cooker, is correspondingly much larger. For example: in\r\nsoups, from 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 hours use of fuel is made unnecessary; pot\r\nroast 2-1/2 hours; beef stew 2-1/2 hours; lamb stew 1-1/2 hours; corn\r\nbeef and cabbage 2-1/2 hours; baked beans 5-1/2 to 7-1/2 hours; chicken\r\nfricassee 2 hours; dried peas, beans, and lentils 3 hours; dried fruits\r\n3 hours; rice pudding 1-1/2 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL GRANTS FOR RURAL AND VILLAGE SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n(From the Revised Regulations of the Department of Education, 1918)\r\n\r\n(1) The Board of a rural or a village school which is unable to comply\r\nwith the provisions of the General Regulations, but which maintains\r\nclasses in Manual Training as applied to the work of the Farm or in\r\nHousehold Science suitable to the requirements of the rural districts,\r\nwhich employs a teacher qualified as below, and which provides\r\naccommodations and equipment and a course of study approved by the\r\nMinister before the classes are established, will be paid by the\r\nMinister the sums provided in the scheme below, out of the grants\r\nappropriated therefor: said grants to be expended on the accommodations,\r\nequipment, and supplies for Manual Training and Household Science.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
