Watch them whenever you can, and each time you will find\r\nout something new. Books will help you, but you must watch, too. Look\r\nmore than you read.\r\n\r\nIf you need to catch them, put them under a tumbler, and feed them and\r\ngive them a drop of water every day to drink. Slip a card under the rim\r\nof the tumbler on one side so as to let in the air. If you do not know\r\nwhat to feed them, or if they will not eat, let them go after a day or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to kill an injurious insect, do it _quickly and completely_.\r\nRemember the insects are alive, and we should not make them suffer\r\nunnecessarily.\r\n\r\nOf course you must try to make your captives feel at home. If they live\r\nin the sand, put sand in the tumbler and tie a piece of netting over the\r\ntop so they cannot escape.\r\n\r\nIf they live in the water, put them in a tumbler of water. And when you\r\nhave secured your captives, watch them as much as you can.\r\n\r\nIf you do not know how to pronounce the words in this book, study the\r\nglossary at the back and it will help you.\r\n\r\nI hope you will have a very happy time getting acquainted with your\r\nlittle insect neighbors.\r\n\r\n                                      MARGARET WARNER MORLEY.\r\n\r\n  BOSTON,\r\n    April 18, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n  OUR PRETTY DRAGON FLIES                                              3\r\n\r\n  THE FAIRY MAY FLIES                                                 25\r\n\r\n  THE STONE FLY FOLK                                                  33\r\n\r\n  THE SILVER FISH                                                     36\r\n\r\n  THE OLD COCKROACHES                                                 41\r\n\r\n  NEIGHBOR WALKING STICK                                              52\r\n\r\n  THE GRASSHOPPER TRIBES                                              59\r\n\r\n  THE SHORTHORNED GRASSHOPPERS                                        61\r\n\r\n  THE LONGHORNED GRASSHOPPERS                                         81\r\n\r\n  PRETTY KATYDIDS                                                     94\r\n\r\n  THE CRICKET-LIKE GRASSHOPPERS                                       99\r\n\r\n  THE CHEERY CRICKET PEOPLE                                          101\r\n\r\n  A LARGE FAMILY                                                     107\r\n\r\n  THE GREAT BUG FAMILY                                               115\r\n\r\n  THE WATER BOATMAN                                                  116\r\n\r\n  THE FUNNY BACK-SWIMMERS                                            124\r\n\r\n  THE GIANT WATER BUG                                                125\r\n\r\n  LITTLE MRS.

One flashed right past Mollie\'s ear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPretty people, I wish one of you would come and sit by us a little\r\nwhile, so we could get a good look at you.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, Ned? You have found a large one lying on the ground?\r\n\r\nSure enough; it is a beauty too, with a green body and silver wings.\r\n\r\nSomething seems to be wrong with it; it does not fly nor try to get\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWhat a big one it is!\r\n\r\nMy! my! what eyes!\r\n\r\nDon\'t crowd, Amy; let little Nell see too.\r\n\r\nWhat is that you say, Richard? "It catches mosquitoes and gnats and\r\nflies and other insects while flying."\r\n\r\nYes, and that is why it has such big eyes. We should need big eyes\r\nourselves if we were to spend our time chasing mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nTwo eyes you have, little dragon fly, like the rest of us, but your eyes\r\nare not like ours.\r\n\r\nNo, indeed!\r\n\r\nEach of your big eyes is made up of a great many small eyes packed close\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nDo you know, children, that some of the largest of the dragon flies have\r\nas many as twenty thousand facets, or small eyes, in each large eye?\r\n\r\nThink of it! Forty thousand eyes in one little dragon fly head. It\r\n_ought_ to see well.\r\n\r\nThese facets are six-sided, excepting those along the edge, which are\r\nrounded on the outside. You cannot see their real shape without a\r\nmicroscope, they are so small. But here is a picture of some facets as\r\nthey look under the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEyes like these, made up of many facets, we call compound eyes.\r\n\r\nAll grown-up insects have compound eyes, though not many have as large\r\nones as the dragon fly.\r\n\r\nOnly insects that chase other insects or that need to see in the dark\r\nhave very large eyes.\r\n\r\nSee what a big mouth the dragon fly has. Its jaws do not show unless it\r\nopens its lower lip, which fits over its mouth like a mask.\r\n\r\nI should not care to have it bite my finger.\r\n\r\nIt could not hurt very much, and its bite is not poisonous, still I\r\nshall handle it carefully.\r\n\r\nSome call the dragon fly a darning needle, and say it sews up people\'s\r\nears when they lie on the grass. This is not true. It does not sew up\r\nanything. It has nothing to sew with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhy should it want to sew up people\'s ears, anyway?\r\n\r\nIt does nothing unpleasant but bite fingers, and it never goes out of\r\nits way to do that.\r\n\r\nIf we let it alone, it always lets us alone.\r\n\r\nIt is our good friend because it catches mosquitoes. For this reason it\r\nis sometimes called mosquito hawk.\r\n\r\nWe should never kill a dragon fly.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is called a spindle, I suppose because it is long and\r\nslender like a spindle.\r\n\r\nDown South the colored people believe the dragon fly brings dead snakes\r\nto life, and they call it snake doctor.\r\n\r\nIn some places it is called snake feeder.\r\n\r\nBut it has nothing to do with snakes, dead or alive.\r\n\r\nThe French have given it a pretty name, _demoiselle_, or damsel fly, and\r\nthat is quite deserved, for the dragon fly is a graceful little\r\ncreature, as pretty as pretty can be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSee, sticking out of the front of its head are two little feelers, or\r\nantenn\xc3\xa6, as we must call them.\r\n\r\nThey are very short, but it does not need long ones.\r\n\r\nInsects smell with their feelers, you know, but our dragon flies see so\r\nwell they do not need to smell very well, I suppose.\r\n\r\nSee how it can turn its head around. That is because it has a little\r\nshort neck between its head and its body.\r\n\r\nIts eyes, its mouth, and its antenn\xc3\xa6 belong to its head.\r\n\r\nOf course our demoiselle can fly well; one need only look at those wings\r\nto know that.\r\n\r\nTo fly well is quite as necessary to one of its habits as to see well.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the use of seeing an insect if it could not fly fast\r\nenough to catch it?\r\n\r\nWe all like your pretty wings, little dragon fly; they look like glass\r\nand they shine so in the sun.\r\n\r\nHow fast the wings can move! See that dragon fly skimming over the pond;\r\nits wings make a whizzing sound as it darts about.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhy does it zigzag so?\r\n\r\nWhy doesn\'t it fly in a straight line?\r\n\r\nYes, Mollie, you are right, it goes zigzagging along after insects.\r\n\r\nIt sees one it wants off at one side--whizz! around it turns after it.\r\n\r\nShouldn\'t you like to fly like that, children?\r\n\r\nAnd yet we would not be willing to exchange our arms and hands for\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nWe could not whittle a stick nor write a letter if we had only wings.\r\n\r\nIn fact we could not do most of the things we now do.\r\n\r\nI am glad I have my hands.\r\n\r\nWe are glad, too, that the dragon flies have their pretty, swift wings.\r\n\r\nThey have four wings, all nearly the same size and shape, you see, and\r\nthey are all stiff and shining.\r\n\r\nSome dragon flies, like this one we have picked up, always keep their\r\nwings spread out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut over there, standing on the end of that stick, is another kind.\r\n\r\nWhen it rests its wings are folded together.\r\n\r\nWhat a pretty one it is! Do you see it?\r\n\r\nIt is small, but so pretty.\r\n\r\nIt is bright blue and shines as though it had been polished.\r\n\r\nSometimes birds catch these smaller dragon flies, though birds, as a\r\nrule, are not fond of any of them.\r\n\r\nThey are so hard and their wings are so stiff I should think a bird\r\nmight almost as well swallow nails.\r\n\r\nI am sure no bird could swallow one of the big ones, wings and all!\r\n\r\nBut frogs can.\r\n\r\nA frog will try to swallow almost anything it can catch, and it watches\r\nfor the dragon flies when they come to lay their eggs in the water.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it jumps out, and away goes poor dragon fly into that great\r\nwide frog-mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow look at the legs of the dragon fly. It has six.\r\n\r\nEvery dragon fly has six legs.\r\n\r\nThey are rather short and small for so large an insect, but that is\r\nbecause it does not need large, strong legs.\r\n\r\nYou never saw a dragon fly dig a hole, or run, or even walk, did you?\r\n\r\nTheir legs are not arranged for walking. All six of them are directed\r\nforwards as though they were reaching out after something. And so they\r\nare--reaching out after insects.\r\n\r\nDragon fly catches his prey while he is flying, and he grasps the\r\ninsects with his feet.\r\n\r\nHe snatches one, and then what?\r\n\r\nDoes he sit down somewhere and eat it?\r\n\r\nNot he, he is far too hungry for that; he continues his swift flight,\r\nand as he flies he eats.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he has finished one fly or gnat, zip! he snatches another.\r\n\r\nHe has an insatiable appetite, consuming hundreds of insects in the\r\ncourse of a day. Nor does he confine his attention to flies and gnats\r\nand mosquitoes and such small fry. He catches what he can. A large\r\ndragon fly will even gorge himself on one of the large-sized\r\nbutterflies, and one has been seen calmly chewing away at an enormous\r\nwasp!\r\n\r\nNo, indeed, Mabel, the dragon fly does not eat the wings of the\r\nbutterfly, it eats only the soft body.\r\n\r\nProbably nothing eats a butterfly, wings and all. Birds and insects\r\nsometimes catch butterflies, and you often see the bright wings lying on\r\nthe ground. The wings of insects are not worth eating, and are almost\r\nalways cast aside by the creatures that eat the insects.\r\n\r\nBesides catching insects with their legs, the dragon flies cling fast to\r\nthings with them, but when they wish to move they do not walk, they fly.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, Frank, you are right; their legs are jointed.\r\n\r\nThat is so they can move them easily and fold them up when they want\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThey would find it as hard to get along without joints to their legs as\r\nwe should.\r\n\r\nWouldn\'t we be stiff if we had no joints!\r\n\r\nSee, the legs and wings are fastened to the middle part of the body, the\r\n_thorax_, we call it.\r\n\r\nAll insects have the legs and wings attached to the thorax.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the body is the abdomen. See how long it is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is the long abdomen that gives the dragon fly its name of spindle, I\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen is jointed, and it can curl up.\r\n\r\nAll grown-up insects have a head, a thorax, and a jointed abdomen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat are you looking at, Charlie?\r\n\r\nSomething moving in the bottom of the pond?\r\n\r\nLet us get it out.\r\n\r\nHere, we will dip it out with this cup.\r\n\r\nWhat a lot of stuff!\r\n\r\nSticks and mud--and--what is that?\r\n\r\nSomething alive, surely.\r\n\r\nLet us put some clean water in the cup and examine what we have found.\r\n\r\nMy! my! what a queer little thing!\r\n\r\nWhat do you suppose it is?\r\n\r\nAh, I know now, but I do not think you could ever, ever guess, not if\r\nyou tried a week.\r\n\r\nIt is a young dragon fly!\r\n\r\nIt does not look much like its shiny-winged parents.\r\n\r\nIt looks like I don\'t know what, with a face like--well, when you look\r\nright in front of it, like a pug dog.\r\n\r\nQueer! Well, I should think so! What is that, Amy? Am I sure it is a\r\ndragon fly?\r\n\r\nYes, there is no mistake; a dragon fly one day dropped an egg in the\r\npond, and out of it hatched--this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt will some day become a shiny-winged dragon fly and catch mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nWe will call it larva, and we will watch it a little while.\r\n\r\nLook and see if it has a head, a thorax, and an abdomen.\r\n\r\nAre there antenn\xc3\xa6 on its head? And has it eyes?\r\n\r\nIf you were to look at its eyes with a microscope, you would find that\r\nthey are made of six-sided facets, like the eyes of the grown-up dragon\r\nfly.\r\n\r\nThey are compound eyes, but they are not as large as the eyes of the\r\ngrown-up dragon fly.\r\n\r\nHow many legs has it? What are its legs fastened to?\r\n\r\nYes, Nellie, thorax is right.\r\n\r\nIts six legs are fastened to its thorax. I am glad you remembered\r\nthorax.\r\n\r\nHas it a jointed abdomen? and has it wings?\r\n\r\nLook! did you see that?\r\n\r\nIt opened its innocent-looking face all of a sudden, just darted it out\r\ninto a long-handled spoon, with hooks at the end, and hooked up that\r\nlittle grub.\r\n\r\nNow it is holding the grub on the hooks in front of its mouth and eating\r\nit as greedily as if it were half starved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo that is why its face looks so queer.\r\n\r\nIt is its long under lip all folded up in front like a mask that makes\r\nit look like a pug dog.\r\n\r\nWhen it pleases it darts out that lip, and any unlucky insect or snail\r\nmay fall a prey to its greedy appetite.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the larv\xc3\xa6 of some dragon flies even eat pollywogs and\r\nsmall fishes.\r\n\r\nNed wants to know if "larv\xc3\xa6" means the same as "larva."\r\n\r\nYes, it is the plural form of the word. When we speak of only one we say\r\n"larva"; when we speak of more than one, instead of saying "larvas," we\r\nsay "larv\xc3\xa6."\r\n\r\nThe dragon fly larv\xc3\xa6 are terrible gluttons, and hidden under the mask\r\nare strong jaws for chewing up their prey.\r\n\r\nTheir legs are quite large and strong, too, for they crawl about the\r\nbottom of the pond or up the stalks of the plants.\r\n\r\nThey do not move about very fast, but they do shoot out that under lip\r\nvery, very, _very_ fast indeed, so good-by to any little live thing in\r\nthe pond that comes within reach of it.\r\n\r\nThe dragon fly larv\xc3\xa6 do not all look alike. They are different in the\r\ndifferent species of dragon flies, and, like the rest of us, they change\r\nas they grow older.\r\n\r\nYes, May, you can keep the dragon fly larv\xc3\xa6 until they change into\r\ndragon flies.\r\n\r\nYou must supply them with fresh water and with enough to eat.\r\n\r\nAnd you must put a net over the bowl or aquarium in which you keep them,\r\notherwise as soon as they are able they will fly away.\r\n\r\nHow can they fly without wings?\r\n\r\nOh, but they are going to have wings. You know they are young dragon\r\nflies in spite of their strange appearance.\r\n\r\nBe sure and feed them enough, or else they will eat each other, and that\r\nwould be a pity; and be sure there are some water plants for them to\r\nhide under and crawl upon.\r\n\r\nYou can give them a little fresh fish or a tiny bit of very fresh meat,\r\nthough they like best the living things they find in the bottom of the\r\npond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the dragon fly larva first hatches it is very small and its legs\r\nare rather long and spidery, but it eats and eats and eats,--my, how it\r\neats!\r\n\r\nAnd it grows and grows, and one day it finds its skin too tight.\r\n\r\nA tight skin must be rather uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nBut the larva does not care much for its skin.\r\n\r\nIt merely splits it open down the back and pulls itself out.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you think it must be yet more uncomfortable to be without a\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nBut it is not without a skin. It is covered by a new and soft one that\r\nsoon hardens, and that is larger than the old one.\r\n\r\nIt wriggles out of its old skin as though it were an old coat, and\r\nleaves it clinging to the weeds in the pond.\r\n\r\nSometime you may find these cast-off dragon fly overcoats.\r\n\r\nAfter it has shed its skin the dragon fly continues to grow. It keeps on\r\ngrowing until it has outgrown its new skin.\r\n\r\nThen what do you think it does?\r\n\r\nYes, Charlie, that is right, it sheds this skin too.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen it sheds its skin we say it moults.\r\n\r\nIt moults several times, and at last little short wings appear. At first\r\nit has no wings at all, you know.\r\n\r\nAmy wonders how the larva breathes under water.\r\n\r\nAh, Master Ned, you are laughing too soon. You think insects do not have\r\nto breathe, but you are very much mistaken, sir.\r\n\r\nInsects do have to breathe.\r\n\r\nThey would die if they could get no air to breathe.\r\n\r\nSome of the dragon fly larv\xc3\xa6 have an odd arrangement for breathing under\r\nwater. They have a sort of syringe in the end of the body, and there are\r\nbreathing pores or gills in the syringe.\r\n\r\nThe water goes in and out of this syringe, and the larva breathes as the\r\nfish does, by means of its gills.\r\n\r\nYes, May, its gills are in its syringe, which seems very odd,--you see\r\nthe dragon fly larva breathes at its tail end instead of at its head\r\nend.\r\n\r\nMollie thinks it is an upside-down, inside-out sort of a creature\r\nanyway. But it knows what it is about.\r\n\r\nNed wants to know how it can get any air to breathe when it lives under\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, there is always air mixed in with water, and it is this\r\nair the larva breathes when the water goes in and out of the syringe.\r\n\r\nIt uses the syringe for another purpose too. When it pleases it can\r\nshoot out the water with great force, and thus propel itself quite a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nBy means of the syringe it can leap through the water faster than it can\r\nmove by its slow-going legs.\r\n\r\nMollie wants to know if we can see the syringe.\r\n\r\nNo, it is inside the body.\r\n\r\nBut there is a kind of dragon fly that has a pair of gills outside, at\r\nthe end of the abdomen, instead of the syringe inside.\r\n\r\nThe best I can do is to show you a picture of one. Some day we may find\r\nit in the pond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThose two feather-like parts at the tail end are gills.\r\n\r\nYes, John, it can propel itself through the water by rowing, as it were,\r\nwith these gills.\r\n\r\nThere are some species of dragon fly larv\xc3\xa6 that swim by moving the tip\r\nof the abdomen from side to side, as a fish moves its body when it\r\nswims.\r\n\r\nBut now let us return to our funny larva that lives at the bottom of the\r\npond. It stays down there, eating and growing and moulting, for nine or\r\nten months or even longer; then something very wonderful happens.\r\n\r\nIt suddenly feels a great desire to get up to the top of the pond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt climbs up a weed or a stick until it is clear out of the water.\r\n\r\nThen its skin splits down the back for the last time, and out there\r\npulls itself, not a larva, but a weak-looking dragon fly, with soft and\r\nflabby little wings.\r\n\r\nNow is its hour of danger, and now is the time for such birds as like\r\nthe taste of young dragon flies to help themselves.\r\n\r\nCatbirds seem to have a special fondness for these helpless insects, and\r\nhave been known to eat them before the flabby little wings had grown\r\nstiff.\r\n\r\nIf the birds do not find the newly emerged dragon fly, it remains\r\nmotionless an hour or so, but it does not remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nIts wings stretch out and harden.\r\n\r\nBright metallic colors begin to play over them and over its body; and\r\nall at once--off it darts, away and away, glittering in the sunshine, a\r\nswift, beautiful winged creature.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of summer you will often see dragon flies darting about\r\nin every direction.\r\n\r\nThey seem to come in swarms and I think they usually come where there\r\nare ponds or marshes, for in such places there are many gnats and\r\nmosquitoes.\r\n\r\nMollie wants to know why it would not be a good plan for people who live\r\nwhere there are many mosquitoes to raise dragon flies?\r\n\r\nThat is a very sensible idea, Mollie, and it has been tried.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed; some men once collected dragon fly larv\xc3\xa6, and took care of\r\nthem until they changed into dragon flies.\r\n\r\nThen what do you think happened?\r\n\r\nAs soon as they got their wings, away went those dragon flies,--away\r\nand away, without stopping to catch a single mosquito for the men who\r\nhad taken the trouble to raise them.\r\n\r\nThe dragon flies will not stay at home.\r\n\r\nThey fly so fast and so far there is no use raising them.\r\n\r\nThey are among the swiftest and strongest of insects.\r\n\r\nHow do the larv\xc3\xa6 get in the ponds? Frank is asking.\r\n\r\nI will tell you what I know about it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe winged dragon flies mate, and the female then drops her eggs in the\r\nwater or lays them on twigs in the water, where they hatch out into\r\nlarv\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nThe dragon flies have to be very careful when they go close to the water\r\nto lay their eggs.\r\n\r\nYou all know why.\r\n\r\nYes, it is because the frogs are on the watch to catch them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe mother dragon fly knows the larv\xc3\xa6 have to live in the water, and so\r\nshe takes pains to put the eggs there; sometimes she even crawls down\r\nunder the water on stems of plants to lay her eggs. Isn\'t she a wise\r\nlittle mother?\r\n\r\nThere are a good many species of dragon flies.\r\n\r\nSome are large and some are small.\r\n\r\nSome are bright and some are dull.\r\n\r\nThere are black ones and bright blue ones, or green ones with blue eyes.\r\n\r\nSome are marked with red and yellow.\r\n\r\nThey are a very gay family.\r\n\r\nThe dragon fly family is also a very old one.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is one of the oldest families on earth.\r\n\r\nLong before there were bees or butterflies or dogs or horses or human\r\nbeings, there were dragon flies.\r\n\r\nDon\'t you suppose that may be why the dragon fly is such a\r\nstrange-looking insect?\r\n\r\nIt does not look like other insects; it is very old-fashioned, like the\r\npine trees.\r\n\r\nPine trees, too, belong to a very old plant family that lived long ago,\r\nbefore there were oaks or maples, or other trees that shed their leaves.\r\n\r\nNow we must go home.\r\n\r\nGood-by, green frog, you may come back to your log now.\r\n\r\nGood-by, pretty dragon fly people, we shall never forget you.\r\n\r\nGood-by, pleasant pond and moss-grown log, we hope to see you often\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAIRY MAY FLIES\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCome, children, and see! Hundreds and hundreds of them are dancing\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nWhat are they? Yes, May, they do make us think of the dragon flies, but\r\nthey are like fairy demoiselles.\r\n\r\nThey are the May flies, fairy ships sailing in the sea of air.\r\n\r\nSee how they are tossed about.\r\n\r\nMany have fallen to the ground, which is covered with them.\r\n\r\nThey live but a day, or sometimes only a few hours, and so they are\r\ncalled day flies, and also ephemer\xc3\xa6, which means short-lived.\r\n\r\nThey have eyes, as you can see, little round eyes, but their mouth is so\r\ntiny they cannot eat.\r\n\r\nStrange little beings to come into the world so helpless!\r\n\r\nHow different from the strong, fierce dragon flies!\r\n\r\nSee their dainty little legs. Six, you see, and legs and wings grow out\r\nfrom the thorax.\r\n\r\nHave they an abdomen?\r\n\r\nSee the long threads at the end of it, they look like slender tails. How\r\nthey spread these threads out as they fly!\r\n\r\nThey have four wings, but the wings are not shaped like those of the\r\ndragon fly, and they are very much more delicate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAGON FLY WINGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAY FLY WINGS.]\r\n\r\nYes, May, I agree with you, they look like fine lace.\r\n\r\nThe fore wings, you see, are larger than the hind ones.\r\n\r\nRichard asks, "Where do May flies come from? and why are they called May\r\nflies?"\r\n\r\nNow, Richard, one question at a time, if you please, and the last shall\r\ncome first because it is easier to answer.\r\n\r\nThey are called May flies because they often come out in the month of\r\nMay, though sometimes not until June, and some species are as late as\r\nJuly in appearing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe shall have to look into the ponds and little streams to discover\r\nwhere they come from.\r\n\r\nSee, John has scooped up some little speckled grubs out of the mud. Is\r\nit possible that _they_ are the larv\xc3\xa6 of our fairy May flies? _They_\r\nhave a mouth!--see what big jaws for such little creatures.\r\n\r\nAnd what do you suppose they eat?\r\n\r\nNo doubt they, too, live on animal food.\r\n\r\nNo doubt they move about in the mud and catch what they can.\r\n\r\nYou see, John had to dig them up; they like to burrow in the weeds and\r\nmud, and some of them even make tunnels of mud in which to protect their\r\nsoft bodies. Their short, stout legs enable them to dig well.\r\n\r\nTheir bodies are soft, but their jaws are not. O dear, no!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe grown-up May flies mate, and then the female drops her eggs on the\r\nsurface of the water. When she does this a fish will very often jump up\r\nand seize her, for fish are very fond of May flies, and lucky are the\r\nMay flies to escape these ravenous enemies.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are heavy and sink to the bottom, where they hatch into these\r\nqueer-looking larv\xc3\xa6 that eat and grow and shed their skin just like the\r\ndragon fly larv\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nThose brushes along their sides are the gills they breathe with.\r\n\r\nSee the gills moving swiftly back and forth; they look as though the\r\nlarva wished to swim with them, but this is not why it moves them so\r\nconstantly.\r\n\r\nThe continual motion of the gills stirs up the water and keeps our larva\r\nsupplied with fresh air.\r\n\r\nNellie is asking what gills are.\r\n\r\nWell, gills in fishes and in such insects as have gills, and in crabs\r\nand lobsters and other creatures that live in the water, are parts that\r\noften look like fringes or flat plates.\r\n\r\nThe gills of fishes have a great many blood vessels running through\r\nthem. The walls of these blood vessels are very thin, and the oxygen\r\nfrom the air that is in the water passes into the blood that is in the\r\ngills, and then this blood, all full of oxygen, circulates through the\r\nfish\'s body.\r\n\r\nYou see in fishes the blood vessels come into the gills and get the\r\noxygen.\r\n\r\nIn insects it is different. There are air tubes running like tiny pipes\r\nall through the gills and into the body of the insect. The oxygen of the\r\nair that is in the water passes out through the walls of these tubes\r\ninto the blood of the insect.\r\n\r\nYes, John, in fishes the blood comes to the air, in insects the air goes\r\nto the blood. The air passes into the air tubes of the insects, and thus\r\nis carried all through their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe blood takes the oxygen out of the air.\r\n\r\nWithout oxygen in the blood no animal could live.\r\n\r\nNow let us go back to our May flies. They remain in the larval state a\r\nyear, and some species remain two years. Think of living in the mud for\r\ntwo long years!\r\n\r\nIn the mud they creep about, eating, eating, eating. Then some summer\r\nday they leave the mud and swim to the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nPop! they are gone.\r\n\r\nThey were so quick about it we could not see what happened.\r\n\r\nThe larval skin burst open and forth leaped the May fly, like a winged\r\nfairy from a prison cell.\r\n\r\nThey do not come out slowly and wait for their wings to dry like the\r\ndragon fly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey spring out all of a sudden and fly away, leaving their cast-off\r\nskin in the pond.\r\n\r\nUnless their motions were quick they might be snapped up by the fish\r\nthat are so fond of them.\r\n\r\nBut though they seem to emerge thus quickly into perfect winged May\r\nflies, they are not quite done with infancy. They are still wrapped\r\nabout by a very delicate skin that they have to get rid of. So they fly\r\nto a bush near the water and stay a little while until this skin splits\r\nand comes off, and they are free.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their quick motions when they spring from the water, many of\r\nthe May flies fall back into it and are caught by the fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration here, as the text is broken]\r\n\r\nIt is said that the trout become fat and good-flavored when the May\r\nflies emerge, they eat so many of them. And what the fish do not catch\r\nthe birds try to. Swallows and other insect-loving birds have a glorious\r\nfeast when the May flies come out. For a season they live in the midst\r\nof more delicacies than they can possibly use.\r\n\r\nFish like the May fly larv\xc3\xa6, too, which is probably the reason the larv\xc3\xa6\r\nhave learned to live in the mud, out of reach.\r\n\r\nFishermen dig up the larv\xc3\xa6 for bait, so you see the May flies have a\r\nhard time to get safely through the world.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of difficulties a great many of them live, and some summer\r\nday out they come trooping.\r\n\r\nThey spring all at once from the surface of the water as by magic,\r\nhundreds and thousands, yes, millions of them. They fill the air, they\r\ncover everything.\r\n\r\nThe great naturalist Swammerdam, who was the first to make a thorough\r\nstudy of the May flies, thus tells us how they appeared in France one\r\nyear:--\r\n\r\n"I then saw a sight beyond all expectation. The ephemer\xc3\xa6 filled the air\r\nlike the snowflakes in a dense snowstorm.\r\n\r\n"The steps were covered to a depth of two, three, or even four inches. A\r\ntract of water five or six feet across was completely hidden, and as the\r\nfloating insects slowly drifted away, others took their places. Several\r\ntimes I was obliged to retreat to the top of the stairs from the\r\nannoyance caused by the ephemer\xc3\xa6, which dashed in my face, and got into\r\nmy eyes, mouth, and nose."\r\n\r\nThese swarms of May flies appear only from three to five days at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWherever there are streams there are May flies, and the canals of\r\nHolland make good breeding places for them; no wonder, then, the Dutch,\r\nwho you know live in Holland, have a saying, "As thick as May flies."\r\n\r\nAlthough so many of the May flies perish at once, multitudes of them\r\ndrop their eggs into the water to renew the race of May flies.\r\n\r\nIs it not wonderful that after so long a period of creeping about in the\r\nmud as larv\xc3\xa6, these graceful and beautiful little creatures have but a\r\nfew hours in which to dance joyously about in the upper air on wings of\r\ngossamer? Some, indeed, live less than an hour, and some, that come out\r\nin the evening, finish their dance of life and perish before sunrise,\r\nwithout ever having seen the beautiful daylight.\r\n\r\nYes, strange little beings are they.\r\n\r\nThey do us no harm and we should not kill them.\r\n\r\nLet them live their short lives and be happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STONE FLY FOLK\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn has been fishing.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think he caught?\r\n\r\nNary fish, my dears, but a goodly number of stone flies, which he has\r\nbrought to show us.\r\n\r\nYes, Mollie, they do remind us a very little of our May flies, only, of\r\ncourse, they are many times larger.\r\n\r\nIt is rather a clumsy creature in spite of its large wings, and John\r\nsays he had no trouble whatever in catching it.\r\n\r\nSee, it has four wings, and the hind ones are the larger.\r\n\r\nYes, May, they fold up in plaits, like the sticks of a fan.\r\n\r\nSee its long antenn\xc3\xa6 and its compound eyes. Its eyes are not so large as\r\nare those of the dragon fly. It does not spend its time pursuing other\r\ninsects, but is more like the May fly after it gets its wings.\r\n\r\nYes, Ned, it lives longer than the May fly, but it does not live very\r\nlong, and it eats little.\r\n\r\nIt is a pretty little gray thing as it rests on the side of John\'s box,\r\nwith its wings folded like a gossamer cloak over its body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt lays its eggs in the water, and out of them hatch little six-legged\r\nlarv\xc3\xa6 that are not troubled by want of appetite. If the winged stone fly\r\ndoes not eat, its larva does; it is like the other larv\xc3\xa6 we know, always\r\ndevouring something.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYes, Charlie, it feeds on living creatures, greatly relishing the larv\xc3\xa6\r\nof the May flies, or any other luckless insect infants it can capture.\r\n\r\nIt grows fast and moults several times, and when winter comes it hides\r\naway, only to come forth at the first breath of spring and continue its\r\neating.\r\n\r\nLike other larv\xc3\xa6 that live under water, it does its breathing by means\r\nof gills, and these gills are in little tufts just above the base of\r\neach leg.\r\n\r\nIt lives under stones, which is why it is called the stone fly, and it\r\nslides quickly around a corner when you lift up its stone.\r\n\r\nFish are very fond of it, and hunt it as eagerly as it hunts larv\xc3\xa6.\r\nSince it makes good bait for brook trout, its life is always in danger.\r\nIt finishes its growth in early summer, and emerges from its larval\r\nskin as a perfect winged insect.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, John, you can often find dozens of the cast-off skins of\r\nthe stone flies along the brook sides in the month of June.\r\n\r\nThe stone flies are harmless little people, and we should never kill one\r\nneedlessly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SILVER FISH\r\n\r\n\r\nMay has something here for us to look at. She says it is a slippery\r\nrascal. Let us see it. Oh, yes, you have it in that little box. See, the\r\nbox has a glass top. May cut the top off the box herself, and fastened\r\nin a little pane of glass so we could see the rascal without danger of\r\nits escaping.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPretty rascal! Like a little silver fish slipping about the box.\r\n\r\nYes, Charlie, it is called the silver fish. A land fish? Why, yes, it\r\nwould be a land fish if it were a fish at all. But in spite of its name\r\nit is no fish. It is covered with shining scales, though, that are very\r\nmuch like fish scales, and it is shaped a good deal like a fish.\r\n\r\nOh, yes, it is an insect. You see it has six legs. But it has no wings.\r\n\r\nNo, it is not a young one.\r\n\r\nIt never will have any wings, no matter how old it may get to be.\r\n\r\nIt is flat, you see, and its scales make it very slippery, so that it is\r\nhard to catch and yet harder to hold on to after you have caught it. It\r\ngoes flashing about like a little silver dart, and it loves to eat\r\nstarch.\r\n\r\nThat is why May calls it a rascal. It eats the starch from the paste\r\nthat fastens on her wall paper, and from book-bindings, so you see it\r\nmakes things fall to pieces. But my! what a pretty rascal it is! Besides\r\nits name of silver fish, it is also called fish moth, though it is not a\r\nmoth at all. It is also called bristle-tail, because of the long,\r\nbristle-like parts at the end of its body; and in some places it is\r\ncalled a slink, because, you know, it loves dark places, and when you\r\nuncover it in the daytime, it slips around a corner into the dark again.\r\n\r\nYes, it seems to slink about as if it were ashamed of itself, but it is\r\nnot ashamed; it does not like the light, and it does not like us to see\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is afraid of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORTHOPTERA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD COCKROACHES\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren, here is a cockroach.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the first insects that came to live on the earth;\r\ncockroaches were here before people, and they are here yet.\r\n\r\nYou do not think it is pretty?\r\n\r\nNeither do I.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know anybody who thinks a cockroach pretty.\r\n\r\nOh, no, it won\'t bite you.\r\n\r\nIt will only get into your pantry and eat your food.\r\n\r\nIt will walk around in the night and frighten you if you go suddenly\r\ninto the kitchen.\r\n\r\nIt will not frighten you on purpose, but when it hears you coming, it\r\nwill run, and then maybe you will scream and run too.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, May? You\'ve a good mind to scream and run as it is?\r\n\r\nVery well, scream and run if you want to; the cockroach won\'t care.\r\n\r\nWe do not often see these big black fellows in the North, but sometimes\r\nwe do. Down South cockroaches seem to be everywhere.\r\n\r\nWhat, May? You are never going South, then?\r\n\r\nWell, you do not need to go; the cockroaches won\'t care.\r\n\r\nThey have little heads and long antenn\xc3\xa6, like threads.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, May? You don\'t care anything about their heads? You don\'t\r\nwant to know anything about cockroaches?\r\n\r\nOh, yes, you want to know about cockroaches. Remember how old they are.\r\n\r\nThey have six legs, you see.\r\n\r\nYou don\'t care how many legs they have?\r\n\r\nOh, yes, you do. They could not walk if they had no legs.\r\n\r\nYou wish they couldn\'t walk?\r\n\r\nDear me, May; you don\'t seem to like cockroaches.\r\n\r\nPoor old cockroaches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThink how old they are.\r\n\r\nWhat is that you say? They are old enough to know better?\r\n\r\nWhy, May, what have they ever done to you?\r\n\r\nNothing, only you don\'t like them?\r\n\r\nWell, well, they don\'t like you, either. Poor old cockroaches; nobody\r\nseems to like them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they don\'t care.\r\n\r\nWill you let me tell you where they came from?\r\n\r\nThey do not belong to this country.\r\n\r\nTheir natural home is tropical Asia.\r\n\r\nYou see, about four hundred years ago, the ships that bore fruits and\r\nother merchandise from India and other warm countries in Asia, bore, as\r\nwell, a number of little, flat, reddish brown stowaways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nStowaways, as you know, are people that do not buy their tickets, but\r\nthat hide among the ship\'s cargo, and so get free transportation to\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nWell, these little flat stowaways were not human beings, they were\r\ninsects. Yes, May, they were the cockroaches.\r\n\r\nWhen they landed from their hot land of Asia in cold England, they must\r\nhave wondered what was to become of them. Many of them no doubt died,\r\nfor they cannot stand cold weather at all; but some of them were\r\ncarried, with the fruits and other things, quite unintentionally, of\r\ncourse, for nobody guessed they were there, into warm cellars and\r\nkitchen cupboards.\r\n\r\n_Then_ they felt at home!\r\n\r\nThey knew better than to leave the cosey nooks where they could hide\r\naway and sleep all day, and when they came out at night would find a\r\ndelicious supper close at hand.\r\n\r\nThey are great eaters, you know, so what with the good things in the\r\npantry and the warmth of the kitchen quarters they prospered wherever\r\nthey could find a kitchen to live in.\r\n\r\nSoon they spread all over the large cities of England and finally into\r\neven remote country districts.\r\n\r\nOf course they found their way to the United States of America, and in\r\nmany houses in the North they have taken lodging. But down South, where\r\nit is always warm enough, they have prospered greatly, and they are\r\nthere in far greater numbers than in the North.\r\n\r\nBesides, there is a large American cockroach that belongs to tropical\r\nAmerica, but that has found its way pretty well over the country. And\r\nthere are cockroaches that live in the woods, some of them coming in the\r\nnight to visit our houses and help themselves from our pantries.\r\n\r\nYes, Mollie, the cockroaches eat almost anything they can find, and what\r\nthey do not eat they spoil by an ill-smelling liquid they give out when\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nIt is this liquid that makes the cockroaches so very offensive to us.\r\nWe cannot bear to touch one because of it.\r\n\r\nCockroaches eat one variety of food that nobody objects to their having.\r\nThey are fond of bed bugs and greedily devour them.\r\n\r\nBesides the large, dark, reddish brown cockroaches there is a little\r\ntan-colored fellow that is often very troublesome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is not a native of this country, but is supposed to have been brought\r\nto England by soldiers from the Crimea, and later it found its way to\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nWe call it the croton bug, but it is not a bug at all, it is a\r\ncockroach.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly numerous about water pipes, and, like the rest of the\r\ncockroaches, it hides in the daytime.\r\n\r\nAt night out troop crowds and crowds of the little tan-colored water\r\nbugs. They run about the floor, and over the pantry shelves. They get\r\ninto everything they can find, and have a beautiful time.\r\n\r\nThey are funny little fellows, and if they were not so troublesome, we\r\nmight admire them.\r\n\r\nHow they can run!\r\n\r\nAll the cockroaches run very fast, so that it is hard to catch one. And\r\nthey are hard and smooth, too, which makes it yet more difficult to\r\ncatch them. They are well made to escape their enemies, and they are so\r\nflat they can hide in cracks or almost anywhere.\r\n\r\nNo, May, they do not fly very much. You see this one has short wings. It\r\nis a male cockroach. The female of this species of cockroach has no\r\nwings at all, only little hints of wings, as it were.\r\n\r\nSuch little useless wings we call "rudimentary" wings.\r\n\r\nJohn says he thinks that is a long word for short wings.\r\n\r\nYes, but it is not a hard word,--ru-di-ment-ary, see if you can remember\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe croton bugs have longer wings and they sometimes fly.\r\n\r\nIf you were to spread out the wings of a cockroach, you would find it\r\nhad four.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, May? You wouldn\'t spread them out for anything?\r\n\r\nYet wise men have been very much interested in our poor, ill-smelling\r\nold cockroaches, and have studied carefully all about them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf you dislike to touch the cockroach so much, perhaps you will look at\r\nthis picture of a croton bug.\r\n\r\nSee, the upper wings are different; the cockroach does not fly with\r\nthem, he merely uses them to cover up the under wings, and we call them\r\nwing covers.\r\n\r\nIt is the under wings the cockroach flies with.\r\n\r\nCockroaches may not be pleasant, but who can say they are not\r\ninteresting?\r\n\r\nWhat other insect lays its eggs in little bandboxes?\r\n\r\nHere is one of the little boxes, shiny and hard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis little case is at first a sticky substance that soon hardens. The\r\neggs lie in it side by side in two rows.\r\n\r\nThese cases remain attached to the abdomen of the female cockroach until\r\nthe eggs are all laid. Then the case falls off, and soon out runs a\r\ncrowd of infant cockroaches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe case is something like a satchel that shuts with a spring. The\r\nyoungsters are packed close together, side by side, with their heads\r\ntowards the mouth of the satchel.\r\n\r\nAs soon as one hatches it pushes open the side of the case and creeps\r\nout. Then the case springs together again to protect the rest of the\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nThey are funny fellows when they first come out, little and\r\nwhite-looking. But they eat and grow of course, and shed their skins,\r\nand after each moult they become darker in color.\r\n\r\nNow, do look again at this cockroach I have taken such pains to catch\r\nfor you and put into the tumbler.\r\n\r\nI think even May will own that it has a cunning little head.\r\n\r\nSee it turn its head around to look at us.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the cockroach is a knowing little fellow.\r\n\r\nThis one is hungry; it has had nothing to eat for some time. We will\r\ngive it this crumb of cake.\r\n\r\nBe careful, or it will get away; it can run very fast, and it is very\r\nquick, you see, in all its motions.\r\n\r\nAh, it is examining the crumb with the tips of its long antenn\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nSee how daintily it touches the crumb.\r\n\r\nIt can smell with its antenn\xc3\xa6, you know.\r\n\r\nNow it has decided the cake is good to eat.\r\n\r\nSee how eager it is!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt almost stands on its head to reach just the part it wants.\r\n\r\nJohn says he does not understand how insects smell with their antenn\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nI can tell you a little about it, John.\r\n\r\nIf you look at one of the cockroach\'s antenn\xc3\xa6 under the magnifying\r\nglass, you will see it is made up of a good many short pieces, or\r\nsegments, as we call them, fastened together end to end.\r\n\r\nYes, Mollie, that is why it can move about so easily. It can curl up\r\nlike a whiplash, you see.\r\n\r\nNext the head is a round segment that fits into a socket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDouble up your right fist and fit it into the half-closed palm of your\r\nleft hand.\r\n\r\nThere! That is like the ball-and-socket joint.\r\n\r\nYou see you can move your fist around in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe insect can move its antenn\xc3\xa6 in all directions because they are\r\nfastened to its head by ball-and-socket joints.\r\n\r\nOn the segments of the antenn\xc3\xa6, particularly towards the tip, are little\r\ndots.\r\n\r\nYou cannot see the dots without the help of a strong microscope, but\r\nthey are there.\r\n\r\nThese little dots are sensitive spots. There is a nerve coming from the\r\ninsect\'s brain to each dot.\r\n\r\nSome of the dots are sensitive to odors, just as the nerves of our nose\r\nare sensitive to odors.\r\n\r\nMay thinks it is very funny that the insects smell with antenn\xc3\xa6 instead\r\nof with noses.\r\n\r\nThe insects, no doubt, would think it very funny for us to smell with,\r\nnoses instead of with antenn\xc3\xa6, if they thought about it at all.\r\n\r\nThe little dots on the antenn\xc3\xa6 are extremely sensitive to smells. They\r\nare often much more sensitive than our noses.\r\n\r\nPut a bit of food at some distance from a hungry cockroach, and it will\r\nnot be long before a pair of long, sensitive feelers will come waving to\r\nand fro out of some dark corner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLittle Mrs. Cockroach has smelled the dainty morsel, and, as soon as it\r\nis dark, out she will run, her feelers moving eagerly this way and that,\r\nuntil she has found it.\r\n\r\nYes, May, insects also feel with their antenn\xc3\xa6. That is why the antenn\xc3\xa6\r\nare often called "feelers."\r\n\r\nThere are other dots on the segments that are sensitive to touch.\r\nSometimes there are tiny hairs on the antenn\xc3\xa6, also sensitive to touch.\r\n\r\nThe little fellows feel and smell, yes, and oftentimes _hear_ with their\r\nantenn\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nMany insects have spots sensitive to sound on the antenn\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, May, it is wonderful that such tiny threads as an insect\'s\r\nantenn\xc3\xa6 should hold so many kinds of sensitive spots.\r\n\r\nAn insect\'s antenn\xc3\xa6 are among the most wonderful things in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd _I_ think a cockroach, in spite of its bad reputation, is a very\r\nwonderful little fellow.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, May? Our cockroach is drawing one of its antenn\xc3\xa6 through\r\nits mouth?\r\n\r\nAh, yes, see it clean its antenna, children.\r\n\r\nIt seems to nibble at it as it draws it through its mouth.\r\n\r\nInsects are very careful to keep their antenn\xc3\xa6 clean.\r\n\r\nIt would not do to let these sensitive spots become covered with dust,\r\nyou know.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEIGHBOR WALKING STICK\r\n\r\n\r\nIsn\'t this a pretty place to sit down and--\r\n\r\n"Ouch! ow! ow! ow!"\r\n\r\nWhy, May, what is the matter?\r\n\r\nAnybody would think you had seen a cockroach.\r\n\r\nWhat has she found, John?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOh, it is a walking stick!\r\n\r\nWhy do I call it that?\r\n\r\nLook and see.\r\n\r\nDoes it not look like a stick?\r\n\r\nAnd does it not walk?\r\n\r\nThen why is not walking stick a good name for it?\r\n\r\nMay thinks its legs look like a collection of pine needles, for they are\r\ngreen and flat on the upper joints.\r\n\r\nIt is as pretty as it is queer, with its brown body and its green legs.\r\n\r\nThis is the male walking stick; the female has brown legs. She is brown\r\nall over, just the color of dried leaves, and she is not as slender as\r\nher mate.\r\n\r\nMollie thinks it is the long and slender thorax that makes the walking\r\nstick look so queer.\r\n\r\nSee its thorax. Its six legs are attached to its thorax, which is as\r\nlong and as slender as the abdomen.\r\n\r\nJohn thinks it looks queer because everything about it is so long and\r\nslender.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLong antenn\xc3\xa6, long legs, long thorax, long abdomen--that is Mr. Walking\r\nStick.\r\n\r\nSir, why do you have such long antenn\xc3\xa6? Can you hear and feel and smell\r\nextra well because of them?\r\n\r\nI wish you could tell us about them.\r\n\r\nNow where is it?\r\n\r\nOh, yes, it is standing on that brown twig. It is so nearly the color of\r\nthe twig and so much the shape of a little stick itself, that it is not\r\neasy to find it.\r\n\r\nThere, it is walking off again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt has a good name, for I am sure that if a stick tried to walk, it\r\ncould not do it more awkwardly.\r\n\r\nSee now, what it is doing, hanging by one foot from that twig.\r\n\r\nHow still it is.\r\n\r\nWho would imagine, seeing it thus for the first time, that it was a\r\nliving creature?\r\n\r\nThe walking sticks feed on leaves, and I suppose their queer shape and\r\ntheir color protect them from being eaten by birds.\r\n\r\nA bird would have to be very close to a walking stick to tell it from a\r\ntwig.\r\n\r\nThe female drops the eggs on the ground, and leaves them to hatch out\r\nand make their way in the world as best they can.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe young walking sticks look just like their parents, only of course\r\nthey are very small, and they are green in color, like the leaves they\r\neat.\r\n\r\nYes, little Nell, I should like to find some too; they must be cunning\r\nlittle things.\r\n\r\nThey eat and grow and moult, and eat and grow and moult, until they are\r\ngrown up.\r\n\r\nThere are a good many species of walking sticks in the world,\r\nparticularly in hot countries; and to their family belong the longest of\r\nknown insects, some being nearly a foot long. Just imagine a walking\r\nstick a foot long!\r\n\r\nAnd some of them are quite prettily colored, though certain species are\r\nnot pleasant to handle, as they give forth a bad-smelling milky fluid\r\nwhen disturbed.\r\n\r\nThey are gentle little folk, all of them, and move slowly about over the\r\nleaves and twigs, not wishing to harm any living thing.\r\n\r\nSome members of the walking stick family have wings, and these are even\r\nmore curious than those that have none.\r\n\r\nTheir wings and legs are flattened to look like leaves, so that it is\r\nvery difficult to find them among the foliage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYes, May, they are also the color of the leaves they live among.\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of one that will give some idea of these strange\r\nlittle people.\r\n\r\nWe have none of these leaf-like insects in our country, but we do have a\r\nnear relative to the walking sticks, though it does not feed on leaves,\r\nI assure you.\r\n\r\nHow many of you are acquainted with his lordship, the praying mantis?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCharlie says he has seen these fellows in Kansas, and Nellie says she\r\nhas a cousin in the South who has told her about them.\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of one; is it not a beauty!\r\n\r\nIts wings are green and its body is brown, so that it can stealthily\r\ncreep about among the foliage without being noticed.\r\n\r\nWhen at rest it holds its front legs up as though it were raising its\r\narms in an attitude of devotion.\r\n\r\nBut not a thought of devotion lies in that cruel little head. There is\r\nonly one idea there; and if any unwary insect were to come along, those\r\ndevotional arms would be thrust out with incredible rapidity, and the\r\nunfortunate insect clasped tightly in them.\r\n\r\nThen the mantis, hugging its prey in the strong trap-like clasp of its\r\nspiked legs, would coolly proceed to devour it alive, eating it as a boy\r\nwould eat an apple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis praying mantis is called a "mule-killer" in the South, where the\r\npeople think the brown liquor it spits out of its mouth, when disturbed,\r\nis fatal to mules.\r\n\r\nThe mantis is also called a devil-horse, a rear-horse, a camel-cricket,\r\nand many other names inspired by its outlandish appearance.\r\n\r\nSome have even thought it looked wise, standing in that knowing attitude\r\nwith extended arms, and so it has been called prophet and soothsayer, as\r\nthough it could foretell what is going to happen.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly it never foretells anything but the approaching death of\r\nsome insect and possibly a coming change in the weather, for insects\r\noften know when the weather is going to change long before we do.\r\n\r\nAlthough our mantes are brown or green, there are a great many species\r\nliving in hot countries that are much more brightly attired; and when\r\nyou find yourself on a visit to the tropics, you must look for the\r\nflower mantis.\r\n\r\nIt mimics in color the brilliant hues of the showy orchids in which it\r\nhides.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to wear its gorgeous robes from a love for the\r\nbeautiful, however, but rather that it may the better lie concealed in\r\nthe heart of the gay flowers, to pounce upon unsuspecting insects that\r\ncome there for refreshing draughts of honey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Africa the mantis is worshipped by the natives, and in\r\nFrance these fellows are believed to point out the way to travellers by\r\nstretching out one leg when questioned.\r\n\r\nIts strange attitude, with uplifted arms, has won the mantis regard in\r\nall parts of the world, though the insects it clasps in these uplifted\r\narms would not be likely to share the good opinion held of this hardy\r\ncannibal.\r\n\r\nFor it is a cannibal, and enjoys eating another mantis as much as\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\nThe mantes are terrible fighters, too, and if there is a meeting between\r\ntwo of them, there is very apt to be a battle in which one is vanquished\r\nand devoured by the other.\r\n\r\nOur mantis lays its eggs, thirty or forty in number, on tree twigs, and\r\nthey are embedded in a soft substance that soon becomes very tough and\r\nhorny. These strange egg-cases of the mantis are easily recognized\r\nbecause they look as though they were braided on top, as you can see in\r\nthe picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYes, May, the tough covering is to protect the eggs from wet and from\r\nprying birds and hungry insects.\r\n\r\nThe young mantes are similar to their parents, only they have no wings.\r\nBut they hold up their spiny front legs and catch insects, and they grow\r\nand moult in the usual way.\r\n\r\nWhile we have been talking about leaf-like insects and mule-killers our\r\nwalking stick has gone off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWell, well, let him go, and good luck go with him.\r\n\r\nI am glad you like the walking stick, children.\r\n\r\nAnd now, May, let me tell you something.\r\n\r\nThis queer fellow is a very near relative of your friend, the\r\ncockroach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRASSHOPPER TRIBES\r\n\r\n\r\nDon\'t you often wonder where they come from? The swarms of grasshoppers\r\nin the late summer?\r\n\r\nCharlie says he walked across a field last night where he believes there\r\nwere as many grasshoppers as there were blades of grass.\r\n\r\nJust think of it! and yet they do not seem to do any harm.\r\n\r\nIn some places, however, they do a great deal of harm.\r\n\r\nThey come flying in swarms that darken the sun, and they settle on the\r\ntrees and the crops and eat up every green thing. There is nothing a\r\nWestern farmer dreads so much as the passing of the grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nGrasshoppers are funny little fellows, and we like them--when there are\r\nnot too many of them.\r\n\r\nSummer would not seem quite like summer unless we heard the grasshoppers\r\nshrilling.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many species of them, and we have placed them in two\r\ndivisions,--The Shorthorned Grasshoppers and The Longhorned\r\nGrasshoppers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHORTHORNED GRASSHOPPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThey have no horns, of course, but some have short antenn\xc3\xa6 that stick\r\nout like little horns, and those we call shorthorned.\r\n\r\nThe right name for the shorthorned grasshoppers is locusts.\r\n\r\nWe call another insect a locust, but the shorthorned grasshoppers are\r\nthe true locusts.\r\n\r\nSome say it was these locusts that John the Baptist ate with his honey\r\nin the wilderness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA good many people in different parts of the world still eat locusts.\r\n\r\nThey are said to be good food when roasted, but I would rather eat\r\nroasted peanuts.\r\n\r\nCome here, little locust, and let us look at you.\r\n\r\nNow, stand still, and show us your short "horns."\r\n\r\nSee its eyes!\r\n\r\nYes, May, they are compound eyes, but I do not know how many facets they\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nWhat a funny little rabbit face it has.\r\n\r\nSee it move its little mouth parts.\r\n\r\nIt bites bits out of the leaves and chews them up very fast.\r\n\r\nHas it teeth? May is asking.\r\n\r\nWell, yes, but not like our teeth. Sometime you must see the mouth parts\r\nof the grasshopper under the microscope. They are very interesting.\r\n\r\nMollie says the locust has a cape on.\r\n\r\nJohn says the cape is the top of its thorax.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrank has been counting its legs; he says it has six.\r\n\r\nSee it walk. It uses all six legs to walk with.\r\n\r\nBut it does something besides walk with its hind legs.\r\n\r\nYes, it jumps with them. How long and large they are! Now watch it jump.\r\n\r\nSee! It draws those long hind legs close up to its body, then suddenly\r\nstraightens them out--and away it goes as though it had been shot from a\r\nspring board.\r\n\r\nJohn says its hind legs work just like a spring, and so they do. It can\r\nleap several times the length of its body. Amy thinks it should be\r\ncalled a grass-jumper instead of a grasshopper.\r\n\r\nSuppose we all look carefully at the locust\'s long hind leg, segment by\r\nsegment.\r\n\r\nWhat, John? You do not know what a segment is?\r\n\r\nWell, a segment is the part between two joints. The joints are where\r\nthe leg bends, you know.\r\n\r\nMay proposes that we draw a picture of the long hind leg.\r\n\r\nIt will be fun to try.\r\n\r\nThere are two tiny segments close to the body.\r\n\r\nIf you are not careful, you will find only one.\r\n\r\nYou must look sharp to see both of them.\r\n\r\nHow well Charlie has drawn his! He has both the little segments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe one next the body we will mark I, and we will call it the coxa.\r\n\r\nThe next little one we will mark II, and that we will call the\r\ntrochanter.\r\n\r\nThe long, strong one, III, we will call the femur.\r\n\r\nThe next one, long and narrow, we will mark IV, and call the tibia.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the leg, made of several short segments, we will call\r\nthe tarsus, and we will mark it V.\r\n\r\nNow how are we to remember all those hard names?\r\n\r\nHere is a jingle that perhaps will help us:--\r\n\r\n  _Coxa_ first, and then _trochanter_,\r\n  Number three the _femur_ stands,\r\n  After this, the long, straight _tibia_,\r\n  And last of all the _tarsus_ comes.\r\n\r\nNow let us see who can learn it first.\r\n\r\nCharlie says we are taking a good deal of trouble over the hind legs of\r\na grasshopper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVery true, Mr. Philosopher, but let me tell you something.\r\n\r\nWhen we have learned the names of the segments in the grasshopper\'s hind\r\nleg, we have learned the names of the segments in the legs of all\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nYou see all the legs are made on one common plan, and it is very\r\nconvenient, as you will soon see, to have the parts named.\r\n\r\nWhat a fine set of drawings of the grasshopper\'s hind leg we have!\r\n\r\nWhy do you suppose the coxa and trochanter are so small?\r\n\r\nYes, John, it is in order that the leg can move easily.\r\n\r\nThe grasshopper can turn its leg in almost any direction because of\r\nthese small upper segments.\r\n\r\nIt can put its leg up over its head if it wants to. Next to the little\r\ncoxa and trochanter is the longest and largest segment in the\r\ngrasshopper\'s leg; I suppose nobody remembers its name.\r\n\r\nListen to little Nell,--"number three the _femur_ stands."\r\n\r\nSo it does, and what a very useful femur it is!\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the long femur and the long, slender tibia, the\r\ngrasshopper would not be a grasshopper--it could not hop at all.\r\n\r\nWatch the grasshopper, and see how he uses those long segments to jump\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFirst he draws the tibia close up to the femur--now he is off!\r\n\r\nHe just straightened those long hind legs out with a jerk, and away he\r\nwent!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhat do you suppose the two little sharp spines at the end of the tibia\r\nare for?\r\n\r\nWhat, May? You did not see any spines?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLook again.\r\n\r\nSee, Charlie has drawn them very plainly in his picture of the\r\ngrasshopper\'s leg. Mark them _s_, Charlie.\r\n\r\nNow we must all look at Charlie\'s picture.\r\n\r\nHe says he thinks he knows what the spines are for--they are to keep\r\nthe grasshopper from slipping when he makes his leap forward.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt Charlie is right.\r\n\r\nMay wants us to look at the beautiful little hinge x where the femur and\r\nthe tibia are fastened together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet us mark it _X_.\r\n\r\nSee the little ball on the end of the tibia. How well it fits into the\r\nhollow on the end of the femur.\r\n\r\nIn order to see this hollow or groove, you must look on the under side\r\nof the leg.\r\n\r\nYes, John, it reminds us of the ball-and-socket joint, only this is a\r\nhinge joint, and does not move in so many directions.\r\n\r\nThe tibia can move towards the femur and away from it on this hinge.\r\n\r\nWhen our little friend gets ready to jump, he draws the tibia close up\r\nto the femur. When he jumps, he pushes the femur quickly away from the\r\ntibia.\r\n\r\nIf you watch the grasshoppers, you will soon understand just how they\r\nuse their hind legs in jumping.\r\n\r\nThe tarsus bends easily.\r\n\r\nIt has three joints.\r\n\r\nThe last segment is a cunning little foot.\r\n\r\nWhat is John doing?\r\n\r\nHe is looking at the grasshopper\'s foot through the magnifying glass.\r\nWise John!\r\n\r\nLet us all look.\r\n\r\nYes, Charlie, we will try to draw it.\r\n\r\nMollie has hers drawn already. Do not hurry too much, Mollie. You cannot\r\ndraw well if you hurry.\r\n\r\nSee the sharp claw on each side of the foot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet us mark these claws _a_ and _b_.\r\n\r\nBetween them is a flat little pad which we may as well mark _c_.\r\n\r\nMay says her picture looks like a crazy pond lily.\r\n\r\nLet us see, May. Well, it _is_ rather funny.\r\n\r\nIf I were you, I should try again. Any child can learn to draw who will\r\nkeep trying.\r\n\r\nTouch the grasshopper\'s foot with the tip of your finger.\r\n\r\nHow the little foot clings to you!\r\n\r\nIt clings by the two little claws that have caught in your skin, and\r\nthat hold fast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhat do you suppose the little pad between the claws is for?\r\n\r\nIt is important, I can tell you.\r\n\r\nJohn says he has heard there is a little pad in the fly\'s foot that\r\nenables it to walk on glass.\r\n\r\nYes, and it is the same with the grasshopper.\r\n\r\nThe little pad between the claws is fringed with hairs.\r\n\r\nYou can see them with a good magnifying glass.\r\n\r\nOut of the tip of each hair comes a little drop of sticky liquid.\r\n\r\nThis fastens the foot to any smooth surface.\r\n\r\nMany insects have these sticky hairs on their foot pads.\r\n\r\nWhen a fly walks up a window pane, it does it by gluing its feet, one\r\nafter the other, to the glass.\r\n\r\nI don\'t wonder you laugh.\r\n\r\nNo, Mollie, the glue does not harden and hold it fast.\r\n\r\nThe fly can easily pull its foot loose. The grasshopper cannot walk on\r\nglass quite as well as the fly. Its foot pads do not cling so well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWould you not like to know the name of these curious little foot pads?\r\n\r\nWe call the foot pad a _pulvillus_.\r\n\r\nSome insects do not have sticky hairs on the pulvillus.\r\n\r\nThere are beetles that simply put the pulvillus so flat against a smooth\r\nsurface that it stays there by the pressure of the air above.\r\n\r\nSome people think that is the way the pulvillus on the fly\'s foot acts.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it acts both ways, sucking fast and sticking by hairs.\r\n\r\nJohn wants to know if the beetle\'s pulvillus does not act just like the\r\n"sucker" that boys make.\r\n\r\nThe sucker, you know, is a round piece of leather with a string attached\r\nto the middle.\r\n\r\nWhen the leather is wet and laid flat on the floor or on a smooth stone,\r\nall the air below it is pushed out, and the air above presses so hard\r\nthat a boy cannot pull the leather up from the floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYou can peel it up from one edge and let the air under easily enough,\r\nand then a baby could lift it.\r\n\r\nWhen the insect wants to move, it peels its foot loose.\r\n\r\nIt can do this very quickly.\r\n\r\nMollie wants to know what all these little sharp spines on the back of\r\nthe tibia are for.\r\n\r\nLet us look at them.\r\n\r\nThere is a double row of them.\r\n\r\nDo they not look a little like a comb?\r\n\r\nI suspect that is what they are, the grasshopper\'s comb.\r\n\r\nInsects are very neat little folks.\r\n\r\nThey are always cleaning their wings and their legs and their antenn\xc3\xa6\r\nand their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe spines on their legs are very convenient for that.\r\n\r\nCharlie says he thinks the grasshopper\'s legs are as good as a whole box\r\nof tools.\r\n\r\nSo they are, and you have not yet heard all they can do.\r\n\r\nThe funniest is to come.\r\n\r\nMr. Grasshopper sings his song with his hind legs!\r\n\r\nHe rubs the inside of his femurs against the outside of his wings.\r\n\r\nThere is a row of very fine spines down the inside of the femur for the\r\nuse of the little fiddler.\r\n\r\nHe scrapes away with these on his wing covers.\r\n\r\nYes, Ned, his femur is his violin bow, and his wing cover is his violin.\r\n\r\nThe noise he makes does not sound much like a violin, little Nell\r\nthinks.\r\n\r\nNo, indeed, it does not.\r\n\r\nIt is the shrilling sound we hear in the grass in the summer time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is only the male grasshopper that sings.\r\n\r\nThe little lady grasshopper sits still and listens to him.\r\n\r\nNow, let us look at the other legs.\r\n\r\nThe front pair are the smallest.\r\n\r\nCan you find the little coxa and trochanter?\r\n\r\nYes, Charlie, we will draw the little front leg.\r\n\r\nLet us number the segments as we did those of the hind leg.\r\n\r\nSee, the femur is larger than the other segments, but it is small as\r\ncompared to the femur of the hind leg.\r\n\r\nThe tibia is shorter, too, than the tibia of the hind leg.\r\n\r\nThe little tarsus is like the tarsus of the hind leg with its claws and\r\nits pulvillus, only, of course, it is smaller.\r\n\r\nThe middle pair of legs is like the front pair, only larger.\r\n\r\nNow, see how the legs are placed on the grasshopper\'s body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe front pair are directed forward. When the insect walks, they pull.\r\n\r\nThe middle and hind legs are directed backward. When the insect walks,\r\nthey push.\r\n\r\nWell, little legs, you all have your own work to do, and you surely do\r\nit very well.\r\n\r\nLet me see, who has front legs as odd as the grasshopper\'s hind legs.\r\n\r\nYes, Mollie, the mantis has.\r\n\r\nLet us look again at the mantis.\r\n\r\nHere is another picture of it.\r\n\r\nIts hind legs are just common walking legs, you see.\r\n\r\nAnd so are its middle legs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJohn says they are directed forward instead of backward.\r\n\r\nYou can see why.\r\n\r\nThey have to take the place of the front legs, that do not touch the\r\nground at all.\r\n\r\nThey have to hold Mr. Mantis up, and pull him along when he wants to\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nNow, let us see if we can make anything out of these front legs.\r\n\r\nThe coxa is small and close to the body.\r\n\r\nThe trochanter, II, is very large and long.\r\n\r\nYes, Charlie, it increases the size and strength of the leg very\r\ngreatly, by being thus enlarged.\r\n\r\nThe femur, III, is large and strong, too, and it has a row of sharp,\r\nspiny teeth down the inside.\r\n\r\nThe tibia, IV, is also well supplied with cruel teeth, and at the end of\r\nit is the tarsus, as you see.\r\n\r\nYou know how the mantis uses these legs. The joint between the tibia and\r\nfemur is a strong hinge joint. If can shut the tibia close to the femur,\r\nthe spiny teeth of the one locking into the spiny teeth of the other,\r\nand forming a terrible trap for the insects that are so unfortunate as\r\nto get caught in its merciless grip.\r\n\r\nAltogether, you see, it is quite a terrible leg, though it has no more\r\nsegments than a common leg.\r\n\r\nThe segments are changed in shape and size from the regular leg\r\nsegments.\r\n\r\nWhen any part is changed from the regular shape or size, we say it is\r\n_modified_.\r\n\r\nThe front legs of the mantis are modified to catch and hold its prey.\r\n\r\nYes, John, the hind legs of the grasshopper are modified too.\r\n\r\nThey are modified to jump with.\r\n\r\nNed says he didn\'t know there was so much to learn about a little thing\r\nlike an insect\'s leg.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, there is a great deal to learn about all living things.\r\n\r\nI wonder how you would like to look at the grasshopper\'s wings for a\r\nlittle while.\r\n\r\nHere is one with large wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSee how they lie along each side of the body.\r\n\r\nThey come together on top like the ridge of a sloping house roof.\r\n\r\nYes, May, they are the roof to the grasshopper\'s body, and they help to\r\nprotect it.\r\n\r\nLet us gently spread them out.\r\n\r\nAh! these roof wings are not what the locust flies with at all.\r\n\r\nSee, folded up under them is a pair of delicate gauzy wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf we are careful, we can spread them out.\r\n\r\nWe will use this dead grasshopper that Charlie has found.\r\n\r\nWhat pretty wings! So dainty! And how cleverly they are folded up, like\r\nlittle fans.\r\n\r\nWho would imagine such delicate gauzy wings were folded away under the\r\nhard, stiff roof wings.\r\n\r\nThe roof wings are called wing covers, because they cover up these\r\npretty inner wings.\r\n\r\nThe locust does not fly with the wing covers.\r\n\r\nIt spreads them out wide to get them out of the way.\r\n\r\nIt flies with the inner wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHow pretty the flying wings are when they are spread out!\r\n\r\nSee, over there goes a grasshopper whose flying wings are bright yellow.\r\n\r\nAnd there goes another with red flying wings.\r\n\r\nSome of the grasshoppers are almost as pretty as butterflies when they\r\nare flying.\r\n\r\nThey show their gay inner wings only during flight.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the grasshopper comes to rest the inner wings close of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe wing joints act like springs.\r\n\r\nThe grasshopper does not have to think about shutting up its wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJohn says it has a spring in its wing covers too.\r\n\r\nOpen the wing cover.\r\n\r\nThere, it locks itself, as it were, and stays open without any effort on\r\nthe part of the grasshopper.\r\n\r\nYou see the grasshopper wants its wing covers to stay open and out of\r\nthe way of the inner wings when it flies.\r\n\r\nSo it just opens them, and there they are.\r\n\r\nIt moves the inner wings very fast indeed when it is flying. It would\r\nnot do at all for them to be fastened open.\r\n\r\nIf it did not move them, it could not fly. The wings fairly _whirr_,\r\nthey go so fast. They beat against the air, and thus the grasshopper is\r\npushed along through the air.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it is done flying it stops moving the wings, and they\r\ninstantly close of themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen it unlocks the wing covers and they shut down over the inner wings.\r\nThey shut down very tightly. They overlap, as you can see, just below\r\nwhere they are fastened to the insect\'s body. Thus they form a very good\r\nroof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhat wonderful wings the grasshopper has!\r\n\r\nAnd there is something more to be said about them.\r\n\r\nSome species of locusts use their wings as musical instruments. When\r\nthey wish to, they rub the upper end of the inner wings against the\r\nupper end of the wing covers when they are flying.\r\n\r\nThis makes the crackling sound we sometimes hear when the locusts fly.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, Mollie? You have caught a locust that has no wings at all?\r\n\r\nWho can guess why?\r\n\r\nAh, yes, our wise John says he thinks it is because it is a young one.\r\n\r\nWhat makes you think so, John?\r\n\r\nI know, you remembered the larva of the dragon fly and of the May fly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThose larv\xc3\xa6 had no wings at first, but the wings grew, and finally at\r\nthe last moult they were full-sized.\r\n\r\nWhen first hatched, the locust larva is like the full-grown locust,\r\nonly, of course, it is very small, and it has no wings at all.\r\n\r\nIt is a little dot of a thing with an enormous head.\r\n\r\nHere are three clinging to a blade of grass.\r\n\r\nAre they not funny little rascals!\r\n\r\nThe baby locust eats and grows and moults until, finally, the wings\r\nbegin to show as little pads at its sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to find these half-grown grasshoppers in the middle of the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nHere is one that little Nell has caught.\r\n\r\nSee its wing pads.\r\n\r\nMollie says they are rudimentary wings.\r\n\r\nIt continues to eat and grow and moult, and the little wings are moulted\r\noff with the rest of the skin--for the wings of the insect are only\r\nmodified parts of the skin.\r\n\r\nBut there are new and larger wings underneath, and these grow and are\r\nmoulted off with the next skin, until, at last, the grasshopper is\r\nfull-grown, with full-grown wings.\r\n\r\nIt will not moult any more after that.\r\n\r\nWhen full-grown, the females lay their eggs.\r\n\r\nWhere do you suppose they lay their eggs?\r\n\r\nSome of them make a hole in the ground.\r\n\r\nThe end of the abdomen is very strong and sharp, and the locust can make\r\na hole with it quite easily.\r\n\r\nWhen the hole is made, then the eggs are laid in it, and the locust\r\ncovers the opening to the hole with a sticky substance to keep out the\r\nwet.\r\n\r\nThe eggs usually lie in the ground all winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJust think of the locust eggs there are under our feet as we cross the\r\nfields!\r\n\r\nMillions and millions of little eggs are hidden in the ground.\r\n\r\nEarly in the next summer the little eggs hatch, and then tiny locusts\r\ncreep up out of the earth and go hopping about everywhere.\r\n\r\nMost of the full-grown locusts die in the fall.\r\n\r\nAs you know, the young ones have no wings, and this is why there are so\r\nfew winged locusts early in the summer.\r\n\r\nSome locusts make their holes in fence rails or in old stumps.\r\n\r\nIt is the locusts, or shorthorned grasshoppers, that sometimes come in\r\nswarms that darken the sun.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing the Western farmer dreads so much as a swarm of\r\nlocusts.\r\n\r\nI have heard how the grasshoppers came in Kansas one year.\r\n\r\nThey appeared all of a sudden in countless millions.\r\n\r\nThey were piled up against the fences clear to the top.\r\n\r\nThey swarmed into the houses, and in places on the railroad track they\r\nwere piled so deep the trains could not run through them.\r\n\r\nThink of a railway train being stopped by grasshoppers!\r\n\r\nThey stripped every leaf from the trees and left them as bare as in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThey ate up every blade of grass.\r\n\r\nBut in the East they do not do so much damage, though they sometimes\r\ncause the farmers serious loss. When summer comes we may listen to their\r\ncheery din with pleasure.\r\n\r\nI am sure we shall enjoy the merry sounds of the grasshoppers all the\r\nmore now that we know something about how they are made, and something\r\nabout the little fellow that makes them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONGHORNED GRASSHOPPERS\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably it was the longhorned grasshoppers that Charlie saw so many of\r\nin the meadow.\r\n\r\nLook, next time, Charlie, and see if the swarms that start up before you\r\nhave not long, slender antenn\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nSee, here is one.\r\n\r\nIts antenn\xc3\xa6 are like threads, and they are longer than its body.\r\n\r\nIf you were to look at its tarsus, you would find it had four joints\r\ninstead of three.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the longhorned, or meadow grasshoppers are very much like the\r\nlocusts, or shorthorned grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nJohn says he thinks the meadow grasshoppers are more slender and\r\ndelicate in shape.\r\n\r\nThat is true, as a rule, though there are some species of the locusts\r\nthat are as slender as the longhorned grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nBut there is one thing about these longhorned fellows that will amuse\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nSome of them have ears on their front legs!\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for insects to have hearing organs on their front\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nYou know what an ear is. It is something to hear with. The hearing part\r\nof our own ears is way inside, out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe outer part of the ear, that we can take hold of, is only a sort of\r\nfunnel to gather up the sound, and we could still hear if this part of\r\nour ears were cut off.\r\n\r\nWay back inside the ear is a little curtain, or eardrum, made of a thin\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\nWhen sounds enter the ear they cause the eardrum to tremble or vibrate,\r\nand this excites the nerve of hearing that is behind the eardrum.\r\n\r\nNow some grasshoppers have a little flat membrane on the tibia of each\r\nfront leg. It is an eardrum. Behind it is the nerve of hearing. When\r\nsounds strike the eardrum it vibrates and excites the nerve of hearing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo you see the insects have _ears_, though they have no funnel-like\r\noutsides to them.\r\n\r\nSo, after all, there isn\'t so _very_ much difference between the way the\r\ngrasshoppers hear, and the way we hear, although they do hear with their\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nYes, Ned, it is about the same thing when they hear with sensitive spots\r\non their antenn\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nThe sounds strike the sensitive spots, which are tiny eardrums, and\r\ncause the nerves that come to them to hear.\r\n\r\nYou see, after all, an ear is only a membrane able to vibrate when\r\nsounds strike it and a nerve sensitive to those sounds.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter much where the ear is located. Our ears are on either\r\nside of our head, and so are the ears of all the higher animals.\r\n\r\nBut the ears of the insects are more useful to them when on the antenn\xc3\xa6,\r\nor the legs, or some have them on the abdomen. An ear is an ear wherever\r\nit happens to be, and the insects hear well enough with theirs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn many species of the longhorned grasshoppers, the male has a curious\r\nmusical instrument on his wing covers, close to where they grow from the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nLittle Mr. Grasshopper sings to his lady-love by rubbing the upper parts\r\nof the wing covers together. You see the round places at _X_,--those are\r\nthe modified parts of the wing cover, by means of which he can make his\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, May? Your grasshopper has a long sword at the end of its\r\nbody?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYes, that is its ovipositor. Ovipositor means "egg-placer."\r\n\r\nWith this long, sharp ovipositor the grasshopper can roughen the bark of\r\ntwigs or make holes in the stems of plants or in the earth.\r\n\r\nThen the eggs are guided down through the long ovipositor to the place\r\nprepared for them, and fastened there by a gummy substance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOnly the female grasshoppers have the long, sword-shaped ovipositor.\r\n\r\nThe ovipositor of the locust is not long and sword-like.\r\n\r\nIt is short, but it is strong and sharp, and you remember how the locust\r\nuses it to dig with.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, Mollie, there are a great many species of locusts and\r\ngrasshoppers, and some of them are very beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn hot countries they sometimes grow to an enormous size.\r\n\r\nMay is asking why they make molasses.\r\n\r\nNo, Ned, of course it isn\'t molasses. Children call it molasses because\r\nit looks like it.\r\n\r\nNow, May, where does it make its molasses?\r\n\r\nIn its mouth, you say, and then it spits it out on your finger.\r\n\r\nWhat? You don\'t like its old molasses on your finger?\r\n\r\nNo, of course not.\r\n\r\nIt smells bad, and it is sticky and disagreeable to the touch, and if\r\nyou happen to put your finger in your mouth it has a nasty taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJohn says he hates to touch the grasshopper on account of this molasses.\r\n\r\nYou _all_ do?\r\n\r\nWell, I guess that is why it makes its molasses; it doesn\'t want you to\r\ntouch it.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\'t want birds to eat it, or other insects to bother it, and so\r\nit smears them with this ill-smelling, sticky liquid.\r\n\r\nSome birds eat it, however, in spite of its molasses.\r\n\r\nTurkeys do.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, Ned? turkeys are not birds, you think?\r\n\r\nWhat are they?\r\n\r\nIf you think about it, you will have to come to the conclusion that\r\nturkeys are birds.\r\n\r\nThen chickens and ducks and geese must be birds?\r\n\r\nWell, so they are. They are all birds.\r\n\r\nBut to return to turkeys.\r\n\r\nA flock of turkeys will spread out in a long line, and go across a\r\nfield, driving the grasshoppers ahead of them, and eating them as fast\r\nas they can pick them up.\r\n\r\nIt is a funny sight to see a big flock of turkeys hunting grasshoppers\r\nin a meadow.\r\n\r\nIt is not funny to the grasshoppers, though.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, Charlie? The grasshopper somehow reminds you of the\r\npraying mantis?\r\n\r\nDo you know it is a near relative of the mantis?\r\n\r\nNow, I will tell you something funny about the mantis.\r\n\r\nIt makes "molasses" like the grasshopper. Yes, it is this harmless\r\n"molasses" that has given it the name of "mule-killer."\r\n\r\nI will tell you something else. If you lie down in the grass and watch\r\nthe grasshoppers, you will have a good time, and you will see some\r\nstrange things.\r\n\r\nNobody can tell you very much about the grasshoppers--or about the\r\nliving creature. The best way is to use your own eyes and watch.\r\n\r\nJust lie down in the grass perfectly still, and soon the insects that\r\nlive in the grass will begin to appear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhat they will do you must find out for yourselves; but you may be sure\r\nit will be worth finding out,--the funny, clever, wise little\r\npeople!--ah! they are good to watch.\r\n\r\nThey will soon go on chirping and shrilling and rasping and kricking and\r\ntapping and whizzing and whirring and buzzing all about you; and if you\r\nlisten sharp, perhaps you can understand some of the things they say.\r\n\r\nAnd this I am sure of; if you really watch and listen, you can learn to\r\nknow the different insects by their sounds, just as you can know the\r\nbirds by their songs. You can even tell whether you are listening to the\r\nmeadow grasshopper, or the locust.\r\n\r\nIf I thought you were not tired of hearing how grasshoppers are made, I\r\nshould tell you some more.\r\n\r\nJohn says he would like to know some more.\r\n\r\nWell, then, I will tell you about their rings.\r\n\r\nYou can see the rings of the grasshopper people very plainly in their\r\nabdomens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of a grasshopper. It is not all drawn. The legs and\r\nwings are not shown, and the abdomen is drawn by itself so you can see\r\nit easily.\r\n\r\nThere are ten rings, you see.\r\n\r\nThe rings are covered with a hard, horny substance.\r\n\r\nThis horny substance is what makes the body of the insect so stiff. It\r\nwould be soft but for the chitin, as the horny substance is called.\r\n\r\nIt is better for the insect to have a chitinous covering.\r\n\r\nIf you had no bones, you would be glad to have your skin hardened with\r\nchitin.\r\n\r\nYou see how it is, you wear your skeleton inside. Your skeleton is of\r\nbones; it is an inside skeleton.\r\n\r\nThe grasshoppers and all the insects wear their skeleton outside. It is\r\nmade of chitin; it is an outside skeleton.\r\n\r\nInsects have no bones.\r\n\r\nThey do not need any. They are kept stiff by the chitin.\r\n\r\nEach ring in the insect\'s abdomen is made of four pieces, the back\r\npiece, the side pieces, and the under piece. You can see the back piece\r\nand one side piece in the picture, but you cannot see the other side\r\npiece nor the under piece without turning the insect over.\r\n\r\nThe rings are made in pieces so the insect can move.\r\n\r\nSuppose each ring were made of one stiff piece like a finger ring. What\r\na poor stiff, old grasshopper it would be! The rings are called\r\nsegments.\r\n\r\nSegment number one has only a back piece, you see.\r\n\r\nAll the other segments have four pieces.\r\n\r\nSegments two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight are alike.\r\n\r\nSegments nine and ten are modified to form the ovipositor.\r\n\r\nThe segments are fastened together by skin. The skin is soft so the\r\nsegments can move back and forth.\r\n\r\nThe segments can be crowded close together to shorten the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe segments can be separated from each other to lengthen the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThere is no chitin in the skin between the segments. It is soft so the\r\nsegments can move.\r\n\r\nDo you know how a telescope is made?\r\n\r\nThe abdomen of the insect can lengthen and shorten somewhat like a\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see the rings in the abdomen of the locust or grasshopper.\r\n\r\nNow, what about the thorax?\r\n\r\nThat, you tell me, has no rings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLook again, and look carefully.\r\n\r\nYou will have to see another picture.\r\n\r\nThis is a picture of the head and thorax of the grasshopper. It is drawn\r\nto show the separate parts of the thorax.\r\n\r\nYes, John, the thorax has three segments. They are grown so close\r\ntogether you would not suspect it until you looked very close.\r\n\r\nThe front legs are fastened to the first segment.\r\n\r\nWhat is fastened to the middle segment?\r\n\r\nYes, May, the middle pair of legs and the wing covers.\r\n\r\nMollie says the long hind legs and the flying wings are fastened to the\r\nthird or hind segment.\r\n\r\nOh, you funny little folks! you are all made up of rings.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, little Nell, the segments of the thorax are made of chitin;\r\nthey are very stiff.\r\n\r\nNed thinks the segments of the legs are made of chitin too.\r\n\r\nTheir outside shell certainly is.\r\n\r\nThe whole outer shell of the insect is made of the horny chitin.\r\n\r\nYou hard little chitin-covered, segmented people, you are very different\r\nfrom us.\r\n\r\nAh! yes, May, they are like us in many ways.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Mollie, insects do have brains.\r\n\r\nThey have muscles, too, to move their little bodies with.\r\n\r\nWe have muscles under our skin, you know. The muscles move our arms and\r\nlegs and bodies.\r\n\r\nIf you clasp your fingers around your arm and then move your arm, you\r\ncan feel the muscles.\r\n\r\nThe insects have muscles inside their chitinous shells. The muscles move\r\ntheir bodies.\r\n\r\nThe muscles are very, very strong.\r\n\r\nThey are stronger for their size than the muscles of a horse.\r\n\r\nJohn, do you know how heavy a load a horse can pull?\r\n\r\nWell, it cannot pull a load equal to the weight of its own body.\r\n\r\nNow, listen to this,--almost any insect can pull a load that is five\r\ntimes the weight of its body!\r\n\r\nAh, yes, some insects can pull a much heavier weight than that. The\r\nhoney bee, for instance, can pull a load twenty times as heavy as its\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nAnd think how our little insect friends can jump! Why, a kangaroo cannot\r\nbegin to jump like a grasshopper.\r\n\r\nNo, indeed, Ned, the finest jumper in the world of men cannot begin to\r\njump as well as a grasshopper, not even with the aid of a spring board.\r\nHe is a mere baby in comparison.\r\n\r\nAh, yes, we can do a great many things better than the grasshoppers,\r\nbut, you see, they can do some things better than we can.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, John?\r\n\r\nYou want to know about the mouth parts of the grasshopper?\r\n\r\nSuppose we leave the mouth parts.\r\n\r\nThey are difficult to understand. We have had a good many new names to\r\nlearn lately.\r\n\r\nWhat, May? You can\'t remember such hard words?\r\n\r\nOh, yes, of course you can.\r\n\r\nYou don\'t mind learning "rhinoceros," and "Mississippi," and\r\n"Popocatepetl," and "eenie, meenie, monie mike," and they are quite as\r\nhard as femur and tibia; and, besides, you have a femur yourself! Did\r\nyou know it?\r\n\r\nYour thigh bone, like the grasshopper\'s thigh, is called a femur.\r\n\r\nYes, Mollie, there is a bone in your leg called the tibia, and you have\r\na tarsus in your foot.\r\n\r\nSo, after all, when you are learning hard words about insects you are\r\nlearning a great deal besides, as you will find.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRETTY KATYDIDS\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nKaty did!\r\n\r\nKaty didn\'t!\r\n\r\nKaty did!\r\n\r\nWell, well, did she or didn\'t she, and what of it anyway.\r\n\r\nCome here, Katy did and Katy didn\'t, the children want to see you.\r\n\r\nShe\'s a pretty little Did and Didn\'t, isn\'t she.\r\n\r\nKaty, why do you not know your own mind and always tell the same story?\r\n\r\nKrick--krick--krick, there, she is talking; that\'s her way of saying\r\n"Katy did."\r\n\r\nKrick--krick--krickkrick. Now she has said "Katy didn\'t."\r\n\r\nWell, we never shall know anything more about it.\r\n\r\nNo, little Nell, she doesn\'t really say Katy did or Katy didn\'t, but it\r\nsounds like that, and we make believe she says it.\r\n\r\nJohn says he is sure the katydids are first cousins to the grasshoppers\r\nand locusts, and so they are.\r\n\r\nThey are very closely related to--which division of locusts, do you\r\nthink?\r\n\r\nOh, yes, the longhorned, of course.\r\n\r\nSee their long, long antenn\xc3\xa6, and the male has the same little musical\r\nplaces on his wings, little membranes that vibrate and make his song of\r\nKaty did and Katy didn\'t.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNo, the little lady katydid cannot sing--only the little male, and he\r\nkeeps it up all night long.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes wish he would get tired or sleepy and stop, but he never\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nWhy do you suppose he likes to sing so well in the night?\r\n\r\nThe katydids generally live on trees and bushes.\r\n\r\nYes, they are a beautiful, pale green people, and that is one reason we\r\ndo not often see them. It is not easy to find a katydid among the green\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nThe female katydids have a long sword-shaped ovipositor with which they\r\nroughen the bark on twigs, and place the eggs there, fastening them with\r\na gummy substance.\r\n\r\nThe egg is glued fast so it will not fall off.\r\n\r\nIt hatches into a little dot of a katydid that has no wings, but, like\r\nthe larv\xc3\xa6 of the other insects we know about, it eats and grows and\r\nmoults, and at last its wings and the rest of its body are full grown.\r\n\r\nIt casts its skin for the last time; it is no longer a larva, but a\r\nfull-grown insect.\r\n\r\nYes, May, we call the young of all insects larv\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSee this dainty katydid that Charlie has caught for us.\r\n\r\nHow pretty it is!\r\n\r\nIts feelers are like long green threads.\r\n\r\nAnd how sensitive they are!\r\n\r\nIt quickly starts away when we touch one of the feelers.\r\n\r\nYes, Mollie, the katydid walks more than the grasshopper.\r\n\r\nIt can jump well with those long, slender hind legs. How beautiful its\r\nhind legs are! They are longer and more delicate than those of the\r\ngrasshopper.\r\n\r\nAnd its wings, how gauzy and dainty! Its wing covers are not so stiff as\r\nthose of the grasshopper. They look almost like flying wings, they are\r\nso delicate.\r\n\r\nSee, they open, and fasten themselves open, like the wing covers of the\r\ngrasshopper; and when they are at rest they overlap like the wings of\r\nthe grasshopper.\r\n\r\nThe inner wings are like fine lace.\r\n\r\nThey look too delicate for use, and yet the katydid flies very well\r\nindeed with them.\r\n\r\nThey are a little longer than the wing covers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the katydid is at rest you can see the tips of the wings extending\r\nbeyond the ends of the wing covers.\r\n\r\nThe part of the inner wing that extends beyond the wing covers is green,\r\nlike the wing covers, you see.\r\n\r\nBut the rest of the inner wing is not green, it is like very thin glass,\r\nor like fine isinglass.\r\n\r\nLook for a moment at the long curved ovipositor of the female katydid.\r\n\r\nIf you look sharp, you will see teeth on it like a little saw. It is\r\nwith these teeth the little katydid is able to rasp the surface of the\r\ntwigs, and make a place to fasten her eggs to.\r\n\r\nHer wings are wrapped about her form like an ample cloak of green.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow, my little katydid, you may fly away if you want to.\r\n\r\nWe are very much obliged to you for letting us look at you, and we hope\r\nwe have not troubled you too much.\r\n\r\nSee her go!\r\n\r\nHow prettily the katydids fly.\r\n\r\nThey seem almost like little birds.\r\n\r\nI am sure they love to fly about in the bright summer-time.\r\n\r\nHappy katydids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRICKET-LIKE GRASSHOPPERS\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow what strange-looking little creature are you?\r\n\r\nJohn says it looks like a grasshopper, only it has no wings and its body\r\nis not that of a grasshopper.\r\n\r\nMay says it looks like a cricket, only it has the long legs of a\r\ngrasshopper.\r\n\r\nIt is called the cricket-like grasshopper, and it is partly like a\r\ncricket, as you see, and partly like a grasshopper.\r\n\r\nIt is a funny little fellow that lives around in dark corners, usually\r\nin the woods.\r\n\r\nDo see those long, spiny legs!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHow he _can_ jump.\r\n\r\nHe has strong, short, sharp spines on the femurs and on the tibias.\r\n\r\nHe has spines on all his legs, and what long feet he has!\r\n\r\nYes, Nell, his antenn\xc3\xa6 are longer than anything else about him. I\r\nshould think they would be in his way.\r\n\r\nHe has no wings at all, and he never will have any.\r\n\r\nHe has two pairs of feelers in front of his mouth that show very\r\nplainly. They show more plainly than the mouth parts of the grasshopper,\r\nthough they are quite like them.\r\n\r\nYes, Ned, they are larger than the mouth parts of the grasshopper.\r\n\r\nThere is another little fellow very similar to the cricket-like\r\ngrasshopper.\r\n\r\nIt has no wings, and the top of the thorax is like a broad shield.\r\n\r\nIt is called the shield-backed grasshopper.\r\n\r\nSee if you can find one of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEERY CRICKET PEOPLE\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nChirp! chirp!\r\n\r\nChirp! chirp!\r\n\r\nAh, listen to that cheery song. It is the cricket on the hearth singing\r\nthus gayly.\r\n\r\nDear little cricket; he lives in the corner by the fireplace. When all\r\nis still we hear his cheery chirp! chirp! chirp!\r\n\r\nSometimes he comes peering out and runs across the hearth, a little\r\nblack fireside fairy.\r\n\r\nDo you know one of the prettiest stories in the world has been written\r\nabout a cricket?\r\n\r\nCharles Dickens wrote it, and it is called "The Cricket on the Hearth."\r\n\r\nBe sure to read this beautiful story. If you do not own it, ask to have\r\nit for Christmas. It is in the book of "Christmas Tales," a book that\r\neverybody ought to have.\r\n\r\nGrasshoppers and katydids are pleasant people, but they live out of\r\ndoors, and they do not seem quite so much like our very own little\r\nfriends as the crickets.\r\n\r\nOf course the crickets live out of doors, too, only once in a while one\r\nof them comes into the house to live with us.\r\n\r\nWe hear them chirping in the grass and among the stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere is a certain place near the seashore where the rocks are alive\r\nwith the black cricket folk.\r\n\r\nThey come peeping out at you from all sides. They skip over the rocks,\r\nand you will often see a pair of long feelers and an inquisitive little\r\nhead looking around a corner.\r\n\r\nYou too, know there are crickets, little Nell?\r\n\r\nLet us go and see them.\r\n\r\nAh, yes, there is one, looking at us out of inquisitive eyes, over there\r\nby that big stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOf course they are cousins to the grasshoppers. I knew you would guess\r\nthat right away.\r\n\r\nYes, John, the little cricket people have flat backs.\r\n\r\nTheir wing covers do not make a peaked roof over their backs, but are\r\nflat on top and bent down at the sides like a box cover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey are not so long as the wings of the grasshopper, but they overlap\r\non top.\r\n\r\nSometimes they are not so long as the body of the cricket.\r\n\r\nJust watch now!\r\n\r\nHow spry the cricket folk are!\r\n\r\nThey jump well, but they also run well. They are always running about as\r\nthough they enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to catch one of them unless we, too, are "as spry as a\r\ncricket."\r\n\r\nFunny little rascals, to come peeping at us like that, from out the\r\ncrevices in the stones.\r\n\r\nWhen we stir,--pop! they are back out of sight.\r\n\r\nThey eat leaves, and they enjoy a piece of nice, ripe fruit, or a bit of\r\njuicy vegetable.\r\n\r\nSee here, one has jumped on my hand and is sitting quite still.\r\n\r\nIt is a male cricket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHow do I know that?\r\n\r\nMay says because it has no ovipositor.\r\n\r\nYes, that is one way to know.\r\n\r\nLook at his wing covers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MALE CRICKET]\r\n\r\nSee how they are ribbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEMALE CRICKET]\r\n\r\nNow look at this cricket Mabel has caught. It is a female, and its\r\nwings, you see, are not ornamented like those of the male.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDo you know the meaning of his heavily ribbed wing covers?\r\n\r\nWhy, his wing covers are his musical instruments. See one of them\r\nmagnified.\r\n\r\nIt is divided into spaces like so many little drum-heads. The ridge that\r\nruns across the top of the wing is something like a file in structure.\r\n\r\nWhen little Mr. Cricket is in the mood for chirping, he raises his wing\r\ncovers and rubs them together.\r\n\r\nThis throws the stiff membranes of which the wing covers are made into\r\nvibration, and the result is the cheery call of our little black fairy.\r\n\r\nLittle Nell says the cricket is more like a brownie than a fairy, and\r\nmaybe she is right.\r\n\r\nYou can easily see the crickets rub their wings together if you watch in\r\nthe fall of the year.\r\n\r\nJohn says, Why do you have to watch in the fall of the year?\r\n\r\nNow who can guess?\r\n\r\nYes, May, it is because the crickets are then full-grown, and have\r\nlarge wing covers. At first, in the early summer, they have no wings,\r\nand so of course, we could not see them chirp.\r\n\r\nThe whole grasshopper tribe is a vocal one; the males all have musical\r\ninstruments, and in Japan, the people are so fond of the song of _their_\r\ngrasshopper folk, which are not quite like ours, that they make tiny\r\ncages for them.\r\n\r\nThe chirpers are caught and put in these cages, and sold in the city\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nYes, little Nell, the crickets make molasses. So do the katydids.\r\n\r\nAll these little hopping neighbors of ours seem to understand the useful\r\nart of molasses making.\r\n\r\nThe mole crickets are different from the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey burrow in the ground like a mole, and we do not often see them.\r\n\r\nThe strangest thing about them is their hands.\r\n\r\nNo, of course they are not really hands, but they look like them.\r\n\r\nAll the joints of the fore legs are modified to form strong digging\r\ntools, and they look very much like the paws of the mole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey are troublesome fellows, sometimes, when they eat the tender roots\r\nof the vegetables in the garden.\r\n\r\nYou all have seen the little tree cricket, but you might not recognize\r\nit as a cricket, it is such a pale little creature.\r\n\r\nIts light green body may often be seen on bushes in the summer-time,\r\nand, if you look carefully, the form will tell you what the little one\r\nis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LARGE FAMILY\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crickets, grasshoppers, walking sticks, praying mantes, and\r\ncockroaches, strange as it may seem, are all near relatives to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThey all belong to one large family or order, the ORTHOPTERA.\r\n\r\nOr-thop-te-ra, is it not a hard word!\r\n\r\nIt will not seem so hard when you know what it means.\r\n\r\nIt comes from two Greek words _orthos_, meaning straight, and _pteron_,\r\nmeaning a wing.\r\n\r\nStraight-wing.\r\n\r\nAnd do you know, it does not mean that the _upper_ wings are straight,\r\nbut that the under wings are folded down in long straight lines.\r\n\r\nNow let us see if we can tell in what ways all of our Orthoptera are\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nThey all have--?\r\n\r\n"Four wings"--that is right, little Nell.\r\n\r\nWhat, John? the walking sticks have no wings?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNot our walking sticks, but yet they belong to a winged family. You\r\nremember the tropical walking sticks that have queer leaf-like wings, do\r\nyou not?\r\n\r\nAre the four wings alike?\r\n\r\nNo, John says, the upper ones are narrow and stiff and serve as wing\r\ncovers.\r\n\r\nThe inner ones are broader and more delicate. They fold up when not in\r\nuse and are used to fly with.\r\n\r\nVery good indeed, John. Now I will tell you something. The Orthoptera\r\nall have mouth parts made to bite with. They do not bite anything but\r\nwhat they eat, however. They are quite harmless so far as we are\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe young Orthoptera look like the old ones, only they have no wings.\r\nThey hatch out of the egg with a head, a six-legged thorax, and an\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\nNow, come, let us look at all of our orthopterous friends again,\r\ncockroaches first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHow do they get about, John?\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, they run, the rascals. They run fast too. They are flat and\r\ntheir six legs are very much alike. They are well built for running and\r\nhiding in cracks.\r\n\r\nSuppose we call them the _Running Orthoptera_.\r\n\r\nNow, look at our mantis.\r\n\r\nHe does not run very much. How is he different from the others?\r\n\r\nAh, yes, he has big front legs, and little Nell says he grabs things\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo he does. Now, what shall we call these grabbers?\r\n\r\nThe Grabbing Orthoptera, Ned says.\r\n\r\nSuppose we say instead the _Grasping Orthoptera_, because grasping\r\nsounds a little better than grabbing. Do you not think so?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow for Mr. Walking Stick.\r\n\r\nWe cannot very well call him a member of the Running Orthoptera, can we?\r\n\r\nAh, Mollie has it. We must call his kind the _Walking Orthoptera_.\r\n\r\nHis six legs are all long and slender, and he moves them slowly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow for those fellows with the long hind legs, the locusts and katydids\r\nand crickets. Yes, all of you are ready to name them.\r\n\r\nWe call them--what?\r\n\r\nMay says, the Hopping Orthoptera.\r\n\r\nJohn thinks Jumping Orthoptera would sound better.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what we name them, the _Jumping Orthoptera_.\r\n\r\nHow many kinds of Jumping Orthoptera are we acquainted with, Ned? Now,\r\nthink before you speak.\r\n\r\nHe says we know the shorthorned grasshoppers, or locusts, the\r\nlonghorned, or meadow, grasshoppers, and the crickets.\r\n\r\nVery well done, Ned.\r\n\r\nMay wants to know what has become of the katydids and the cricket-like\r\ngrasshoppers--she thinks Ned has left them out.\r\n\r\nNed says they belong to the longhorned grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nNow you shall have a list of the Orthoptera that will help you to\r\nremember them.\r\n\r\nIf we can group together things that are like each other, it is easier\r\nto remember them.\r\n\r\n       ORDER ORTHOPTERA.\r\n\r\n      _Running Orthoptera._\r\n          Cockroaches, Croton Bugs.\r\n      _Grasping Orthoptera._\r\n          Praying Mantis.\r\n      _Walking Orthoptera._\r\n          Walking Sticks.\r\n      _Jumping Orthoptera._\r\n          Shorthorned Grasshoppers, or Locusts.\r\n          Longhorned, or Meadow, Grasshoppers.\r\n          Crickets.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many species of Orthoptera in the world, and we have\r\nseen but a very few of them.\r\n\r\nBut I can tell you, we feel a little better acquainted with you\r\northopterous fellows than we did.\r\n\r\nThe dragon fly says we have not given him a place.\r\n\r\nBut, dear dragon fly, you belong to another family. You are not an\r\northopterous insect.\r\n\r\nYour order is called the ODO-NA-TA.\r\n\r\nThe wings of the Odonata are very different from those of the\r\nOrthoptera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYou remember how they are?\r\n\r\nYes, Ned, they are stiff and covered with a close network of fine veins,\r\nand all four of them are alike.\r\n\r\nNo wing covers, you see.\r\n\r\nI do not know why they have the name Odonata.\r\n\r\nThe young Odonata are not like their parents, excepting that they have a\r\nhead, a thorax with six legs, and an abdomen. But they certainly do not\r\nlook like their parents!\r\n\r\nNo, John, the May flies do not belong to the Odonata. Their wings are\r\nquite different.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDo you not remember how small the hind wings are?\r\n\r\nThe name of their order is EPH-E-MER-I-DA.\r\n\r\nThere is a big name for a little insect!\r\n\r\nIt comes from the Greek word _ephemeros_, and you know what it means.\r\n\r\nWhat? Has everybody forgotten about the dainty little ephemer\xc3\xa6, that\r\nlive but a day?\r\n\r\nThat is what _ephemeros_ means, lasting but a day.\r\n\r\nThe stone flies have four wings, but they are not like those of the\r\nOdonata, or of the Ephemerida.\r\n\r\nDo you remember how the hind wings are folded?\r\n\r\nYes, May, in plaits, so these are the plaited wings, or\r\nPLE-COP-TE-RA, from _pteran_, a wing, and _plecos_, plaited.\r\n\r\nThe little silver fish, as you remember, has no wings at all,\r\nso its order is called THY-SA-NU-RA, from its bristle tail,\r\n_thysanos_, in Greek, meaning a tassel, and _oura_, the tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMIPTERA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT BUG FAMILY\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, my children, do you know what a bug is? Most people do not.\r\n\r\nThey call every insect a "bug," but bugs are bugs, flies are flies, ants\r\nare ants, and neither flies nor ants are bugs.\r\n\r\nIndeed, no insects are bugs--excepting just bugs!\r\n\r\nOur croton bugs are not really bugs. They do not belong to the bug\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA bug has four wings--when it has any.\r\n\r\nBut its wings are not like those of the Orthoptera or Odonata or\r\nEphemerida or Plecoptera.\r\n\r\nSome bugs have no wings.\r\n\r\nYoung bugs are like old bugs, only smaller, and they have no wings.\r\n\r\nYou remember the Orthoptera and Odonata bite their food.\r\n\r\nThey chew it up and swallow it.\r\n\r\nBugs do not bite, they suck. Their mouth parts are often grown together\r\nin the form of a tube that is sometimes very sharp.\r\n\r\nThey stick these sharp tubes or beaks into their food, and suck it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER BOATMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, May; you want to see a bug? Well, that is easy enough.\r\n\r\nHere is one in this pond at our feet. Do you know it?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYes, John; it is the water boatman.\r\n\r\nNell says she doesn\'t see it.\r\n\r\nThere, Nell, that little thing that shines like silver under the water.\r\nIt is clinging to a weed.\r\n\r\nNo, we cannot see it very well unless we catch it.\r\n\r\nNed, do you think you can be spry enough to scoop it out with the net?\r\n\r\nThere, he has it,--no, it is off.\r\n\r\nWell, we shall never see that one again; but here, in this corner of the\r\npond, see, several of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow don\'t be in too great a hurry, Ned; they are hard to catch.\r\n\r\nHe has it!\r\n\r\nHere, don\'t touch it,--bugs are biters, remember.\r\n\r\nPut it in this tumbler of water, and clap the cover over\r\nit--quick--so!--now we have it.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, Mollie? I just said bugs do not bite, and now I call them\r\nbiters?\r\n\r\nI don\'t wonder you are puzzled.\r\n\r\nThey do _not_ bite, but they pierce with their mouth tubes, and that\r\nfeels just as though they bit us. So we commonly speak of bugs as\r\nbiting.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to be very exact, we will hereafter speak of bugs as\r\npiercing or sucking.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Water Boatman, we are going to have a good look at you.\r\n\r\nNell says it is not like silver any more, but just a little black and\r\ngray speckled bug.\r\n\r\nThat is because it is now on top of the water. When it goes under it is\r\nsurrounded with a layer of air, and that is what makes it look as though\r\nit had on a silver dress.\r\n\r\nMay wants to know how it manages to take a layer of air down under the\r\nwater. If you were to look at it with a magnifying glass, May, you would\r\nsee it is covered with fine hairs; the air becomes entangled in these\r\nhairs. Do you not remember how the leaf of the jewel weed, or\r\ntouch-me-not, as it is also called, shines when you plunge it in water?\r\nIt, too, is covered with fine hairs that hold air. Many leaves shine in\r\nthis way when put under water, and always because of the fine hairs\r\nthat prevent the air from being pushed out by the water. You see the\r\nhairs on the bugs serve the same purpose as those on the leaves; they\r\nhold fast the air.\r\n\r\nOur water boatman breathes this air that surrounds him.\r\n\r\nYou know how insects breathe do you not?\r\n\r\nDear me, then I shall have to tell you.\r\n\r\nThey have no lungs; of course, so they cannot breathe with lungs as we\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nTake a long breath--see how your chest rises--that is because you filled\r\nyour lungs full of air.\r\n\r\nWell, the insects have to breathe air.\r\n\r\nEvery living thing has to breathe air. Nothing in the world could live\r\nwithout air.\r\n\r\nEven plants breathe the air, you know.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a little row of holes or pores along each side of the\r\nabdomen of the insect.\r\n\r\nThese are the breathing pores. No, May, the insects do not breathe\r\nthrough their mouths, they breathe through their sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYou can see the breathing pores, or spiracles, as they are called, very\r\nplainly in many insects.\r\n\r\nYou can see them on the abdomen of the locust, and in some caterpillars\r\nthey are bright-colored spots.\r\n\r\nThere are spiracles on the sides of the thorax, too, but they do not\r\nshow so plainly as those on the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe spiracles open into air tubes that carry air to the blood of the\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Spiracles_]\r\n\r\nIf you watch a grasshopper or a bee, you can plainly see it breathe. The\r\nabdomen moves in the bee as though it were panting. These movements of\r\nthe abdomen cause the air to go in and out. All insects move their\r\nabdomens to send the air in and out, but it does not show plainly in all\r\nof them, for, though insects need air, some of them can get along with\r\nvery little.\r\n\r\nYes, John, insects have blood. It is not just like our blood, but still\r\nit is blood.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally red in color, though sometimes it is reddish, and\r\nsometimes it is brown, or violet, or even bright green.\r\n\r\nYes, that seems strange to you, but you remember how ears are ears, and\r\nserve to hear with, no matter where on the body of the creature they are\r\nlocated. So blood is blood, and serves the purpose of blood, no matter\r\nwhat its color. The blood of some insects has a very bad odor, and in\r\nthe case of certain beetles, when they are disturbed, this foul-smelling\r\nliquid oozes out of the joints of the legs.\r\n\r\nYes, Mabel, it is probably used, like the "molasses" of other little\r\nfriends we know, to repel enemies.\r\n\r\nBut to return to breathing. Some larv\xc3\xa6 breathe by gills, and do not have\r\nspiracles until they are grown up, but all grown-up insects breathe by\r\nspiracles.\r\n\r\nYes, John, the larv\xc3\xa6 of the dragon flies and May flies breathe with\r\ngills.\r\n\r\nI thought you would remember that.\r\n\r\nThe water boatman breathes by spiracles, and carries his supply of air\r\nwith him. All grown-up bugs breathe by spiracles.\r\n\r\nNow look down into the pond. I think you will see some water boatmen\r\nanchored near the bottom.\r\n\r\nYes, May, they cling by their front feet. Their hind pair of legs are\r\nrather odd-looking; they have a fringe of hairs on the inside.\r\n\r\nJohn says their hind legs are modified to swim with.\r\n\r\nVery good, John.\r\n\r\nThe hind legs are the oars that row these little boats about in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBut why are the little boats that have come to anchor down there moving\r\ntheir paddles so constantly?\r\n\r\nAh, yes; it is because they want fresh air to breathe.\r\n\r\nYou know there is always air in pond water, and they keep their paddles\r\nmoving, so as to change the envelope of air that surrounds them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey know what to do to take care of themselves, if they _are_ nothing\r\nbut little bugs.\r\n\r\nWhen winter comes, they go down to the bottom of the pond and bury\r\nthemselves in the mud. They lie there without moving or breathing until\r\nspring, when out they come, as lively as ever.\r\n\r\nYes, certain other animals pass the winter in this way; the bears, for\r\ninstance, find a snug den and sleep all through the coldest winter\r\nweather. We call this winter sleep of animals hibernation, and many of\r\nthe insects hibernate.\r\n\r\nYes, Ned, hibernating animals can get on with very little air; they\r\nsometimes seem to need none at all, and they take no food.\r\n\r\nMay wants to know what these queer water boatmen eat.\r\n\r\nThey suck out the juices of other insects.\r\n\r\nThey must lay their eggs in the water, little Nell thinks.\r\n\r\nAnd so they do, on water plants.\r\n\r\nNear the city of Mexico there are species that lay enormous quantities\r\nof eggs in the ponds, and what do you think? The Indians mix these eggs\r\nwith meal, make them into cakes, and eat them.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican bugs are gathered by the ton, too, and sent to England as\r\nfood for cage birds, fish, and poultry.\r\n\r\nLittle Nell thinks there must be a great many bugs in a ton. Indeed,\r\nthere are, probably about twenty-five millions of them; so you can\r\nimagine Mexico is well supplied with water boatmen!\r\n\r\nWhen the young ones hatch out they look like their parents, only, of\r\ncourse, they are tiny little dots of things that have no wings.\r\n\r\nBut they eat and grow and moult like other larv\xc3\xa6 until they are\r\nfull-grown insects.\r\n\r\nWhat have you discovered, Ned? You look surprised.\r\n\r\nThe water boatman has no antenn\xc3\xa6!\r\n\r\nIt doesn\'t seem to have any. But look carefully and I think you will\r\nfind some tiny ones tucked away under its head.\r\n\r\nNell wants to know if the water boatman has a thorax and an abdomen.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it has, but you will have to look carefully to see them. Its\r\nabdomen is short and thick and hard. The water boatman is much more\r\ncompact in form than the Orthoptera, or any of the other insects we have\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nYou are right, John, an insect with a long abdomen, like the\r\ngrasshopper, could not get on very well in the water.\r\n\r\nNow, May, take the cover off the tumbler. There!\r\n\r\nOur water boatman was not slow to make use of his wings.\r\n\r\nWell, good-by and good luck to you, little water boatman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUNNY BACK-SWIMMERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, John? You know a water boatman that swims on its back?\r\n\r\nThat makes Nell laugh, and no wonder.\r\n\r\nYes, there is a little bug that swims on its back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is very much like the water boatman, and it has long paddles made of\r\nits queer hind legs.\r\n\r\nUnlike the water boatman, however, its back is not flat but is shaped\r\nlike the keel of a boat.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, it just turns over and swims with its keel-shaped\r\nback in the water.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes called the back-swimmer, and most boys are well\r\nacquainted with it.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about catching it in your fingers, Ned?\r\n\r\nAh, you do not like to!\r\n\r\nIt has a very sharp beak for sucking the life out of other insects, and\r\nif you succeed in getting hold of it, it will stick that into your\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\nAnd my! how it does sting!\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy matter to catch it, however,--it is such a quick\r\nlittle rascal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT WATER BUG\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nA good many kinds of bugs live in the water, but perhaps the oddest of\r\nall is the giant water bug.\r\n\r\nIt _is_ a giant!\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen very large, flat brown bugs lying on the ground under\r\nthe electric street lamps?\r\n\r\nThose are the giant water bugs.\r\n\r\nThey fly in the night from pond to pond, and are attracted by bright\r\nlights.\r\n\r\nThey fly into the electric lights, and are killed in great numbers\r\nsometimes.\r\n\r\nThis is such a common habit with them that in some places they are\r\ncalled electric light bugs.\r\n\r\nA good many people never saw these bugs until they were found dead\r\nunder the electric lights, and so they imagined they did not exist until\r\nelectric lights were invented.\r\n\r\nBut that is a very foolish notion; the bugs were here thousands of years\r\nbefore electric lights were dreamed of.\r\n\r\nThe giant water bugs are not pleasant to handle when alive.\r\n\r\nIf you ever succeed in catching one in the water, which is not easy,\r\nthey slip about so quickly, be sure and not take it in your fingers.\r\n\r\nThe California children call a species they have there "toe-biters," and\r\nthey say they bite their toes when they go in wading.\r\n\r\nThe giant water bugs are the largest of living bugs, and they even kill\r\nand eat fish.\r\n\r\nTheir fore legs can shut up like a jackknife. The tibia shuts into a\r\ngroove in the femur, and thus the bug is able to seize and hold its\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nIt clasps its victim in its arms, as it were, and calmly proceeds to\r\nsuck out its blood.\r\n\r\nIn some species of the giant water bugs the female does not leave her\r\neggs in the pond to take care of themselves; she puts them on the back\r\nof her mate, who is obliged to carry all of his progeny about with him\r\nuntil they relieve him by hatching out and swimming off to see life for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE MRS. SHORE BUG\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMay says she wants to hear more about bugs. Well, there is little Mrs.\r\nShore Bug. I think you must all know her.\r\n\r\nShe is the little bug that flies along in front of you on the seashore,\r\nor, indeed, on the edge of any body of water.\r\n\r\nShe flits along just in front of you, and is so quick in her motions\r\nthat you will hardly ever catch her.\r\n\r\nShe does not fly far--she alights just far enough ahead to make you try\r\nagain to capture her, but when you think you have her, she isn\'t there!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe has sped off on one of her short flights, and so she will continue\r\nto do as long as you continue to chase her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AIRY WATER STRIDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThen there are the water striders.\r\n\r\nThey are bugs, and it is easy to guess how they got their name.\r\n\r\nYou surely remember the longlegged, dark colored fellows that straddle\r\nabout on top of the water, in ponds or in still pools in streams?\r\n\r\nWho has not tried to catch them!\r\n\r\nAnd how very seldom any one succeeds!\r\n\r\nMay knows where we can see some water striders close at hand.\r\n\r\nThey are on the pond in the meadow. Let us go.\r\n\r\nAh, you little ones! There you are, scampering over the water on your\r\nairy, fairy feet, as though you were on dry land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHow they flash about! And what cunning dimples their little feet make on\r\nthe water when they stand still!\r\n\r\nIf we keep very quiet, they will stop darting about in that wild way,\r\nand we can see them better.\r\n\r\nNow, water striders, why do you behave so, and what do you eat?\r\n\r\nEat? Why, insects, of course. And as to behavior, they may well wonder\r\nmore at ours than we at theirs.\r\n\r\nThey skate about on the surface of the water all summer, and when winter\r\ncomes they hide away at the bottom of the pond, right under the water,\r\nor along the edges of the banks.\r\n\r\nWhen the warm spring sunshine wakes up the sleeping plants, then the\r\nlittle water striders wake up too.\r\n\r\nOut they come, to resume their endless skating and insect catching, but\r\nnow they lay their eggs, gluing them fast to water weeds.\r\n\r\nThe young water striders look like their parents, and they, too, like to\r\ngo circling and flashing over the top of the water, with their long legs\r\nspread out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA QUEER FELLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you suppose is in this box?\r\n\r\nLittle Nell may open it.\r\n\r\nThere, out he comes--slowly, as though he were looking around and\r\nthinking about it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMay says, "Hello, Mr. Walking Stick, you here again?"\r\n\r\nHo! ho! _is_ it Mr. Walking Stick?\r\n\r\nYou look again.\r\n\r\nMollie thinks, if she were going to name it, she would call it Mr.\r\nWalking Threads.\r\n\r\nYes, it is more slender than even the walking stick.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, John? You thought insects had six legs, and this has only\r\nfour?\r\n\r\nNow, here is something for us to think about.\r\n\r\nNed says it has six long threads that might be legs, but it does not\r\nwalk on the two front ones.\r\n\r\nIt seems to use them as antenn\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNed says those front ones look to him to be jointed just like the\r\nothers, and he thinks they are legs.\r\n\r\nMollie says they have no little feet like the others, and she thinks\r\nthey are antenn\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nWell, well, what are we to do? Think of its having feelers that look\r\nlike legs or legs that look like feelers, so that you cannot tell which\r\nthey are!\r\n\r\nNow it is beginning to move, and--Oh, ho, that long part in front is not\r\nits head!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSee, it separates into two--what?\r\n\r\nSurely, two front legs.\r\n\r\nSee, they were folded up, somewhat like the front legs of the mantis,\r\nonly these could fold close together, being threadlike.\r\n\r\nSo the long threads are antenn\xc3\xa6 after all.\r\n\r\nNow it has raised its head, which we easily see is quite round, with\r\ntiny eyes, and the antenn\xc3\xa6 are growing out from the front of it.\r\n\r\nWhat is it? A walking stick? A mantis?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhy! why! There it goes, sailing off in the air with a queer little\r\nfluttering motion of its whole body.\r\n\r\nIt has wings!\r\n\r\nJohn has caught it and brought it back.\r\n\r\nNow let us see those wings, you strange little creature.\r\n\r\nYou will have to look close, but there they are, narrow, short, such\r\ntiny wings! How _do_ you suppose it flies with them?\r\n\r\nYou seem queerer and queerer the more we look at you, little\r\nwhat-shall-we-call-you.\r\n\r\nBut we know you are not a walking stick because our walking sticks have\r\nno wings.\r\n\r\nThe truth is you are a--bug!\r\n\r\nYes, this little threadlike creature belongs to the same order as the\r\nbig flat giant water bug.\r\n\r\nIt grasps its victim, in its fore feet like the mantis, but instead of\r\nbiting its prey it sucks out the juices.\r\n\r\nYou would hardly expect such a delicate creature to catch and kill other\r\ninsects, yet such is the case.\r\n\r\nNo, I do not think it will pierce your finger with its beak. I have\r\noften handled them, and have never been stung by one. We often see them\r\nwalking about in the grass and along paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WELL DRESSED LACE BUG\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAWTHORN TWIG.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIF we pay a visit to that hawthorn bush we shall probably find\r\na bug to our liking. Yes, here is one.\r\n\r\nIt is a tiny thing, I know, but wait until you see it under the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nAh, I thought you would be pleased!\r\n\r\nNell says it looks as though it had on a lace party dress.\r\n\r\nIs it not a dainty fairy!\r\n\r\nWe call it the lace bug.\r\n\r\nIt does not suck the juices of other insects, but instead it sucks the\r\njuices of plants.\r\n\r\nIts eggs are very curious. It lays them on leaves and glues them fast.\r\nThey look like little out-growths of the leaf.\r\n\r\nThe young lace bugs are like their parents in form, only, of course,\r\nthey have no wings and so they are not pretty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFairy lace bug, we are glad to make your acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BAD BUG\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, here is a bug we all loathe. It is round and flat, and reddish\r\nbrown in color, and it has a disgusting odor.\r\n\r\nBut though we hate this bug, it is very fond of us. It has a short,\r\nsharp tube folded down under its head, and this tube it likes to raise\r\nup and stick into the skin of people, and suck out their blood.\r\n\r\nIt has no wings, only a pair of little scales where its wings should be.\r\nYes, May, these scales are rudimentary wings, and they are good for\r\nnothing. It once had wings, but it preferred to go slipping about in\r\ncracks and hiding in beds, until in course of time no wings grew, which\r\nserved it right.\r\n\r\nIt has antenn\xc3\xa6 and eyes and spiracles; indeed, it has everything a bug\r\nshould have but wings and good manners.\r\n\r\nWe call it the bed bug because its favorite home is in beds, so that it\r\ncan sally forth at night and feast upon its sleeping victims.\r\n\r\nIt lays its eggs in cracks and crevices, and each egg is like a little\r\njar with a rim and a lid at the top. When the young one hatches it\r\npushes off the lid. The young are in shape like their parents, only they\r\nare very light colored, and almost transparent. They look like ghosts of\r\nbugs, but they are very voracious ghosts indeed, and they eat and moult\r\nand grow and become darker colored until they reach maturity.\r\n\r\nOne strange thing about them is that they can live a very long time with\r\nnothing to eat, so that houses long vacated may still contain these\r\nnuisances, that sally forth, eager to round out their emaciated forms at\r\nthe expense of the new occupants of the house.\r\n\r\nThe barn swallow is sadly afflicted by a species of these unwelcome\r\nvisitors to its nest, and the poor bats are also victimized by a species\r\nof bed bug.\r\n\r\nThe bad odor comes from a liquid poured out of the back of young bugs,\r\nand from the under side of old ones.\r\n\r\nThese insects are very undesirable acquaintances, and they breed so fast\r\nthat even one, brought into a house, may cause it to become generally\r\ninfested in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nEternal vigilance and great cleanliness are the housekeeper\'s only\r\nsafeguards.\r\n\r\nThere are some species of bugs that closely resemble the bed bugs, only\r\nthey have wings, and live on flowers or in the cracks of the bark of\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TROUBLESOME RED BUG\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a great many kinds of bugs on the leaves and flowers in\r\nsummer, and some of them do much damage by eating the vegetation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most troublesome of these is the red bug. Here is a picture\r\nof one.\r\n\r\nIts wings look as if they had an X drawn on them.\r\n\r\nLet us spread out one of the wings.\r\n\r\nWhy do you all laugh?\r\n\r\nSure enough, Ned, how _can_ we spread out the wings of a bug in a\r\npicture?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut there is a way out of that difficulty.\r\n\r\nYes, another picture.\r\n\r\nOnly the upper wings are spread out.\r\n\r\nYou see, the half of the wing next the body is stiff like a wing cover,\r\nand the other half is thin and silky, and folds up under the stiff part.\r\nWhen the insect flies it spreads out the under wings, too, for there is\r\na pair of thin, flying wings folded on the body under these upper wings.\r\n\r\nThese upper wings, that are half wing cover and half flying wing, are\r\ncharacteristic of the bug order.\r\n\r\nNot all the bugs have them, but a great many have.\r\n\r\nThe name of the bug order is HEM-IP-TERA, meaning half-wing.\r\nYou see why.\r\n\r\nYes, John, the word "hemiptera" comes from two Greek words, _hemi_,\r\nmeaning half, and, as you know, _pteron_, meaning a wing.\r\n\r\nThe young red bugs are like the old ones, excepting in color.\r\n\r\nWhat do we call the young of insects, little Nell?\r\n\r\nYes, we call them larv\xc3\xa6. These red bug larv\xc3\xa6 are bright red with black\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nThey pierce the cotton plants in the South, and suck out the juices.\r\n\r\nOf course, they grow and moult until they arrive at the adult form.\r\n\r\nWhat, John? You do not know what "adult" means? Adult means "grown-up."\r\n\r\nIt is a short way of saying grown-up; and after this, when we mean a\r\ngrown-up insect, let us say an adult insect.\r\n\r\nTo return to the red bug. When it reaches the adult state, it is not\r\nsuch a bright red, but rather of a reddish color with brownish wings\r\nstriped with light yellow.\r\n\r\nBeside eating the juices of the cotton plants and thus injuring or even\r\nkilling them, the red bugs stain the white cotton and spoil it.\r\n\r\nThey are also troublesome in some parts of Florida, where they pierce\r\nthe skins of the oranges, and cause the fruit to decay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAVENOUS CHINCH BUGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a great many bugs injurious to vegetation, among them the\r\nlittle chinch bugs.\r\n\r\nThey are so small, each one no larger than a plant louse, that you would\r\nnot think they could do much harm.\r\n\r\nOne of them could not, but when they appear in millions, then they are\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\nHere is one magnified to show the white wing covers with black markings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWould you believe that this tiny insect has destroyed millions of\r\ndollars\' worth of grain in the United States?\r\n\r\nWhat, Charlie? you should think they could be killed out? That is a very\r\ndifficult task. You see they are so small, and they breed so fast. There\r\nare two broods of them in one year, and when they have eaten one grain\r\nfield they start off, millions strong, to another.\r\n\r\nOf course a great many methods have been tried for getting rid of them,\r\nand one very curious method you will like to hear about.\r\n\r\nYou know insects are subject to diseases.\r\n\r\nWhat, Nell, you never heard of a sick bug?\r\n\r\nYet it seems they are sick sometimes, and certain diseases kill them.\r\nChinch bugs are not as healthy in some places as in others.\r\n\r\nThere is a contagious disease that kills them off in very great numbers.\r\n\r\nNed says he can guess what remedy the people apply to the healthy chinch\r\nbugs that are eating their grain.\r\n\r\nYes, they introduce diseased chinch bugs into the grain fields with the\r\nhealthy ones. The contagion spreads and the bugs die!\r\n\r\nThere is another way of getting rid of some kinds of troublesome\r\ninsects. That is, to introduce an insect not injurious to vegetation,\r\nthat will prey upon the injurious ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WELL PROTECTED STINK BUG\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the bugs we know the best and like the least is the stink bug.\r\n\r\nIt deserves its name.\r\n\r\nJohn says he had one on his hand this morning.\r\n\r\nHow did you like it, John?\r\n\r\nDid any of you ever pick berries where these bugs were?\r\n\r\nSee what a face Mollie is making! It is very evident that _she_ has.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED RASPBERRY.]\r\n\r\nWhat a nasty taste they give the delicious fruit.\r\n\r\nEven the flavor of the red raspberry is spoiled if one of these bugs\r\npollutes it.\r\n\r\nWhat makes them smell so? May is asking.\r\n\r\nThe disgusting odor is caused by a liquid that is ejected out of little\r\npores on the under side of the thorax.\r\n\r\nThe bug can eject this liquid when it pleases.\r\n\r\nMost members of the bug order can eject a disagreeable liquid, though\r\nfew of them do it so successfully as the stink bug.\r\n\r\nIf the stink bug is not disturbed, it does not give forth the bad odor;\r\nbut when we jostle the bushes in getting the berries, that startles it,\r\nand we get the benefit of its alarm.\r\n\r\nYes, undoubtedly the bugs make a bad odor for the same reason the\r\ngrasshoppers make molasses. They wish to repel their enemies.\r\n\r\nVery few birds ever touch a stink bug.\r\n\r\nNell thinks a bird would be crazy to eat a stink bug.\r\n\r\nMollie says if it were not crazy when it began, it surely would be\r\nbefore it got through!\r\n\r\nNot only the bugs make these disagreeable odors.\r\n\r\nMany other insects do.\r\n\r\nThe cockroaches, as we know, and one reason we dislike them so is\r\nbecause of this offensive odor.\r\n\r\nSome species of crickets, too, and indeed many, many insects give forth\r\nodors from glands that exist just for that purpose.\r\n\r\nNo, indeed, these odors are not all alike. Some have a strangling\r\nquality like ammonia, and sometimes the odors are not disagreeable. Some\r\ninsects have sweet odors, like perfumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe pleasant odors are not used to repel, but to attract.\r\n\r\nIf an insect wishes to see its mate, it may be able to give forth a\r\npleasant odor that will reach a long way through the air, and the mate,\r\nsmelling it, will follow it to its source. You see, this pleasant odor\r\nis one way of talking; at least it is one way of sending a message.\r\n\r\nInsects can detect odors much better than we can.\r\n\r\nNo doubt many insects produce odors that affect other insects, but that\r\nare so faint we cannot smell them at all.\r\n\r\nThe sense of smell, even in the human being, is very wonderful. It is\r\nthe keenest of all the senses.\r\n\r\nYou have studied weights and measures, and you know how small a quantity\r\na grain of anything is. Well, you will be astonished to know that your\r\nnose can detect the presence of 1/2,760,000,000 of a grain of mercaptan,\r\na substance having a very bad smell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo you see, insects that can smell very, very much better than we would\r\nbe greatly influenced by the odors of other insects.\r\n\r\nSome of the stink bugs, although so disagreeable if disturbed, are very\r\nuseful to us, as they eat other insects injurious to vegetation.\r\n\r\nMost of them, however, eat fruits and vegetables, and some species do a\r\nvast amount of mischief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, John, lice are bugs, and very mean bugs too.\r\n\r\nThey have lived at the expense of other creatures so long that they\r\ncannot exist unless they have a living body to feed on.\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of one very much enlarged. No wings, no beauty, a pale\r\nwhite thing, all claws and mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt has a long sucking tube by which it pierces the skin, and a sucking\r\nstomach by which it pumps the blood into its mouth.\r\n\r\nSuch creatures are called parasites.\r\n\r\nYes, bed bugs are parasites too.\r\n\r\nBesides the lice that live on human beings, there are species that\r\ninfest animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRD LICE AND BOOK LICE\r\n\r\n\r\nBird lice are not lice!\r\n\r\nThat is, they do not belong to the bug order.\r\n\r\nThey belong to a small order by themselves, but they are parasites like\r\nthe lice.\r\n\r\nThe little white book lice that scurry away when we open an old book\r\nthat has been standing on the back shelf, are not lice, either; they\r\nalso belong to a little order of their own, and are constructed very\r\ndifferently from the true lice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEND CICADA\r\n\r\n\r\nWHIR-R-R-R-RRRRR!!\r\n\r\nMay says she wishes that locust would keep quiet. It makes her warmer\r\nthan ever to hear him carrying on so this hot day.\r\n\r\nJohn says it is the weather that is warm, not the song of the locust.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, locusts generally sing during the hottest part of the summer,\r\nso that we have learned to associate them with warm weather.\r\n\r\nSince we must listen to its shrill out-cry, I wish we could also see\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAh, that is a wish soon gratified! Here comes one out of John\'s pocket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJohn says it is _not_ a locust.\r\n\r\nAh, yes, the shorthorned grasshoppers are the real locusts, and this\r\nfellow has somehow got the name.\r\n\r\nBut it is not a locust.\r\n\r\nIt is also called the dog-day harvest fly, but it is not a fly, though\r\nit looks considerably like one.\r\n\r\nReally, you know, it is a--bug!\r\n\r\nYes, it belongs to the bug order.\r\n\r\nIts true name is cicada, and its shrill midsummer song has been famous\r\nfrom the beginning of time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt looks like an enormous fly, but its mouth parts are the mouth parts\r\nof the bug, and in other respects it resembles the members of the bug\r\norder, when it is examined closely.\r\n\r\nWhat glassy wings!\r\n\r\nLet us spread them out carefully. Four of them it has.\r\n\r\nThe cicada, you see, has no wing covers. Nor are its upper wings, half\r\nwing cover, and half wing, like those of so many of the bugs.\r\n\r\nNo, all four of its wings are alike, and all four are flying wings.\r\n\r\nWhen it is at rest, the inner wings slip out of sight under the outer\r\nones, which fold down like a roof over its body.\r\n\r\nSee how beautifully the wings, are veined.\r\n\r\nYou think cicada has a very broad back, Nell?\r\n\r\nSo it has, and a broad head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSee its black eyes on the corners of its head!\r\n\r\nHow many facets have its eyes?\r\n\r\nI wish I knew, but I do not. This, however, I can tell you. If you look\r\non the top of its head between its compound eyes, with a magnifying\r\nglass, you will find it has three little eyes there.\r\n\r\nThese small eyes are simple, and are called _ocelli_.\r\n\r\nMany insects have ocelli, indeed, some of the grasshoppers have these\r\nextra eyes on top of their head.\r\n\r\nMay says the grasshoppers are very astonishing insects.\r\n\r\nYou think you know all about them, and you are all the time finding out\r\nsomething new. You would not be apt to notice these little ocelli on the\r\ngrasshopper\'s head, they are so small, and besides, some of the\r\ngrasshoppers do not have them.\r\n\r\nYes, Mollie, it is the same with the crickets and katydids. Some species\r\nhave ocelli, and some have not.\r\n\r\nIf you look full in the face of a cicada, you can see the three little\r\nround ocelli between the compound eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey show very plainly with a magnifying glass.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is difficult to explain what the ocelli are for.\r\n\r\nSome think they are to see objects close at hand, while the compound\r\neyes see more distant objects.\r\n\r\nOthers think the ocelli are only capable of distinguishing light from\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nYet others think they are merely a "survival" of the eyes of the worms.\r\nYou know, way back in time, before there were winged insects there were\r\nworms. In some way the insects are descended from the worms, and though\r\nthey have got rid of many of their wormlike parts they still retain some\r\nof them, and probably among these are the ocelli.\r\n\r\nWhen an animal of any kind keeps organs that belonged to its ancestors,\r\nbut that are of no use to it, we say these organs are "survivals." They\r\nhave not yet had time wholly to disappear.\r\n\r\nYes, John, the time may come when the ocelli will disappear from the\r\ninsects. A good many insects have lost them already.\r\n\r\nIndeed, you are right, May; they have lost them because they did not use\r\nthem. When an animal ceases to use an organ in course of time, for lack\r\nof exercise, that organ dwindles away and disappears. It generally takes\r\na very long time for this to happen.\r\n\r\nYes, Mabel, thousands or even millions of years may pass before an organ\r\nthat has gone out of use entirely disappears. As generations succeed\r\neach other each generation loses a little power in that organ until,\r\nfinally, there is no organ left.\r\n\r\nJohn is puzzled to know just what is meant by an organ. It is some\r\nparticular part of the creature. An arm is an organ, a stomach is an\r\norgan, an eye is an organ. The whole creature is made up of organs, and\r\nis called an _organism_.\r\n\r\nYour whole body, John, is an organism, but your legs and arms are\r\norgans. Now, I think you understand.\r\n\r\nOur cicada has one organ that is very interesting; it is the little\r\napparatus by which it sings.\r\n\r\nTurn it over, Ned, and all of you look at the two thin plates lying\r\nagainst the abdomen just below the thorax.\r\n\r\nThose membranes are like two little kettle drums, and they are its song\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nThere are other membranes beneath them, and large muscles within the\r\nbody to move the membranes.\r\n\r\nThe membranes being set in rapid vibration we get the shrill cry of the\r\nlocust.\r\n\r\nOnly the male has the kettle drums. In the female these organs are\r\nrudimentary, and she is dumb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCicada, you are a pretty little thing with your clear, glasslike wings\r\nand your black body with red and green trimming. See its mouth lying in\r\nthat little groove under its head. It is a tube, and sharp. The cicada\r\nsticks it into a leaf or young twig to suck out the juice.\r\n\r\nNell wants to know if the young cicadas are like the old ones. Indeed,\r\nthey would be cunning little things if they were, and--yes, they _would_\r\nlook very much like flies.\r\n\r\nBut the young cicadas are queer babies, indeed. They do not look very\r\nmuch like their parents, although they have a head, a thorax, and an\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe female cicada makes a slit in the bark of the tree twig with her\r\novipositor and lays the eggs there. As soon as they hatch out, the tiny\r\ncicadas drop down to the ground and burrow into the earth.\r\n\r\nYou would not know that they are cicadas, they are such queer-looking\r\nlittle things. But they have strong, sucking mouth parts with which they\r\npierce holes in the roots of trees and suck out the juices.\r\n\r\nOf course these larv\xc3\xa6 grow and moult and continue to do so until they\r\nhave moulted a good many times and grown quite large.\r\n\r\nThey stay down under the ground two years.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that time they crawl up to the surface of the earth in the\r\nearly summer.\r\n\r\nThey climb trees, or weeds, or fence posts, and then the skin splits\r\ndown the back for the last time, and out comes a full-grown cicada with\r\nbright glassy wings.\r\n\r\nThe wings of the larva do not grow at each moult like the wings of the\r\ngrasshopper.\r\n\r\nThe larva never gets beyond short little wing pads. See John\'s eyes\r\ntwinkling! I believe--yes, he has! He has brought us the cast-off skin\r\nof a cicada to look at.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhy, John, you are like a good fairy to us to-day, giving us just the\r\nthings we want just when we want them.\r\n\r\nNow, see this little shell. See the front legs, like strong paws to dig\r\nwith. And see its little glassy eyes, and its little wing pads!\r\n\r\nIt is a perfect cast of the cicada larva.\r\n\r\nYes, May, this little cast is made of chitin, and it will last a long\r\ntime. Chitin is a very indestructible substance; even fire will not\r\ndestroy it, but in course of time the moisture and the acids in the\r\nearth destroy it, so that at last the millions of cicada shells and\r\ngrasshopper cast-off skins, which are also of chitin, and cricket\r\nmoults, and all the other little cast-aside chitinous overcoats of the\r\ninsects, return again to the earth and the air whence they came. The\r\nminerals and gases that compose them let go of each other, as it were,\r\nand the chitin is no longer chitin.\r\n\r\nAmy says she has seen these little cicada shells hundreds of times but\r\ndid not know what they were.\r\n\r\nYes, we are sure to find them almost every summer.\r\n\r\nIf we look, we will also find other larv\xc3\xa6 shells. Down in the grass are\r\nthe cast-off coats of the grasshoppers and the crickets.\r\n\r\nAll we need do is to look, and we shall be sure to find them--like\r\nunsubstantial ghosts of the active little wearers.\r\n\r\nNo doubt you all have heard of the seventeen-year locusts. They, too,\r\nare cicadas, and they look very much like this one, only it takes the\r\nyoung ones seventeen years to complete their growth.\r\n\r\nThink of living in the ground and sucking the juices out of the earth\r\nand of tree roots for seventeen years!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHow would you like to do it?\r\n\r\nBut no doubt the cicada is quite happy living in this way.\r\n\r\nAt the end of seventeen years the cicadas come up out of the earth in\r\ngreat swarms.\r\n\r\nThey cast their skins for the last time. The queer little shells are\r\nseen everywhere, and the air resounds with the songs of the freed\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nIn the South it takes only thirteen years for these cicadas to develop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI once went up the side of a beautiful mountain in North Carolina, where\r\nwas such a mighty host of cicadas in the trees that I could not hear my\r\ncompanion speak, and a little way off the noise sounded like a torrent\r\nof rushing water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ODD SPITTLE INSECT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy, little Nell! What is the matter?\r\n\r\nYou do wish the frogs would stop spitting on the grass?\r\n\r\nLet me see; why, poor child, she is all covered with frog spittle.\r\n\r\nThat is kind, Ned. See, he is wiping her apron off with some fresh,\r\nclean leaves. Let us rest awhile under this shady tree.\r\n\r\nJohn, pick that grass blade with the frog spittle on it. Be careful not\r\nto disturb it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere is a surprise in store for you; this white frothy substance that\r\nis so abundant in some places in the summer and that looks like spittle\r\nis--guess what?\r\n\r\nFrog spittle, May says. So you think the frogs spit on the grass do you?\r\nThey must be tall frogs to reach up so high.\r\n\r\nWith this little twig let us carefully brush away the white froth.\r\n\r\nNow see.\r\n\r\nYes, there is something in the centre of it.\r\n\r\nIt is the larva of a--bug!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe female bug, and here is one of the little things, lays the egg on\r\nthe leaf or twigs, and when it hatches the young bug sucks out the sap\r\nof the plant which finally appears as this white froth.\r\n\r\nThe larva remains surrounded by the froth until its transformations are\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nJust before the last moult it stops sucking out sap. The froth dries\r\nabout it in the form of a little room, and in this it undergoes its last\r\nmoult and comes out--an adult bug.\r\n\r\nThe froth is supposed to be used as a protection, and it may be against\r\nsome enemies, but there are certain wasps that delight in invading the\r\nfrothy masses and hauling out the unwilling morsels within to feed to\r\ntheir young.\r\n\r\nNo, little Nell, the frogs have nothing whatever to do with this frothy\r\nsubstance which was called frog spittle before people understood about\r\nthe little insect that made it.\r\n\r\nThey really thought the frogs did it.\r\n\r\nThe adult spittle insect is called a frog hopper, and it has the power\r\nof leaping very well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRETTY LEAF HOPPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nJust see this bush! Be careful not to shake it.\r\n\r\nIt is covered with such pretty, bright-colored little insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere, May ran against the bush and see--they are hopping wildly off in\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\nYes, little Nell, they do sound like rain drops pattering on the leaves.\r\n\r\nThey are prettier than the spittle insects and more slender, but they\r\nhop about in very much the same way.\r\n\r\nThe larv\xc3\xa6 do not make froth, however.\r\n\r\nThese are the leaf hoppers.\r\n\r\nWhat big heads they have!\r\n\r\nAnd how daintily their green forms are pencilled with red lines.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many species of the leaf hoppers, and not all of them\r\nare as pretty as these.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSome of them are very small indeed, and some do great damage to the\r\ngrain crops and the fruits.\r\n\r\nThey suck out the juices of the plants.\r\n\r\nIf you sweep the insect net over bushes or through the grass in\r\nmidsummer, you will be pretty sure to draw in a good collection of leaf\r\nhoppers.\r\n\r\nMost of us are only too well acquainted with the rose-leaf hopper that\r\nswarms on rose bushes and kills the leaves. If we have not noticed the\r\ninsect itself, we have not failed to notice the little white skins that\r\nit has cast off and left clinging to the leaves.\r\n\r\nYes, these are the little skins it discards when it moults.\r\n\r\nJohn says we can kill them by washing the bushes with strong soap suds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNed says it is better yet to spray them.\r\n\r\nIt is better and also easier to spray them than to wash them.\r\n\r\nYou know there are machines for spraying trees and other plants. They\r\nconsist of a tank to hold the liquid that is to be sprayed and a pump to\r\nforce it through a rubber pipe with a sprinkler at the end.\r\n\r\nVery often a mixture of soap and kerosene oil, known as "kerosene\r\nemulsion," is used to spray with.\r\n\r\nParis green and blue vitriol, both very poisonous, are often used on\r\ngrape vines before the grapes are formed, and very gaudy vines they are\r\nfor a little while after this bright poison has been sprayed upon them.\r\n\r\nAlthough insects are so very interesting, we have to protect ourselves\r\nagainst many species in order to live.\r\n\r\nYes, John, it is oftentimes merely a question which shall profit by the\r\ncrops we plant, the insects or ourselves.\r\n\r\nSometimes the insects win, sometimes we win, but it is a closely\r\ncontested warfare all the time.\r\n\r\nWe plough the land and take care of it, we plant the seeds and keep out\r\nthe weeds. Then, when we have a fine crop growing, along come certain\r\ndestructive insects, feeling very happy, no doubt, to have found such a\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\nNow the fight begins. They attack the crop, we attack them. We spray\r\nthem with poisons, burn up their eggs, do everything we know how to get\r\nrid of them.\r\n\r\nWise men have spent many years of close study finding out the habits of\r\nthe insects destructive to grains and fruits, in order to be able to\r\ndestroy them.\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the plant hoppers are such nuisances to us, there is\r\none family of hoppers that is seldom a nuisance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMICAL TREE HOPPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you know the tree hoppers,--absurd little jokers that they are?\r\n\r\nOh, yes, they are hard and three cornered, like animated beechnuts, as\r\nsomebody has said.\r\n\r\nYes, some of them have humps on their backs and some have horns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJohn says he once made a collection of tree hoppers and put them in a\r\nbox with a reading glass over the top, and showed them to his friends to\r\nmake them laugh.\r\n\r\nMay says she saw them, and they reminded her of Brownies.\r\n\r\nWould it not be fun to have a tree hopper Brownie book!\r\n\r\nThe tree hoppers jump about on the bushes and eat the juices of the\r\nplants, but there are not usually enough of them to do damage. They\r\nseldom come in swarms like some of the leaf hoppers, though sometimes\r\nthey do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUMPING PLANT LICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jumping plant lice are nearly related to the tree hoppers, but they\r\ndo not look at all like them.\r\n\r\nUnder the magnifying glass they look like tiny cicadas.\r\n\r\nSee, here is a picture of one enlarged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTheir natural size is no larger than a plant louse.\r\n\r\nHave you not often seen them clustered close together on the young twigs\r\nof pear trees--tiny, light-colored things that jumped in all directions\r\nwhen you touched the twig?\r\n\r\nThe name of the plant louse that infests pear trees is the pear-tree\r\npsylla. It is very destructive to pear trees, sucking out the juices of\r\nthe young shoots.\r\n\r\nThe pear trees can be saved by spraying them with kerosene emulsion as\r\nsoon as the young leaves have opened in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APHIDS\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, let us go in search of the aphids, or aphides, as they are also\r\ncalled. We shall not have to search far.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn a very dry season we generally need not search at all. All we need do\r\nis to examine the nearest weed to find plenty of aphides.\r\n\r\nYes, they are the little plant lice that seem at times to cover every\r\ngrowing thing.\r\n\r\nSometimes they are green, sometimes brown, or gray, or reddish, in\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nThey are tiny creatures, but what they lack in size they more than make\r\nup in numbers.\r\n\r\nGo now, and find some aphides.\r\n\r\nAh, here you all come, each bearing a leaf or a twig on which are\r\naphids.\r\n\r\nThere was no trouble in finding them!\r\n\r\nThey do not hop like the jumping plant lice when they are disturbed.\r\nThey remain where they are unless they are very much shaken up.\r\n\r\nSee, most of them are without wings, though here are a few with\r\nbeautiful transparent wings.\r\n\r\nAntenn\xc3\xa6 they have, long and threadlike. And see, the knowing little\r\neyes!\r\n\r\nThey seem to be anchored to the leaf.\r\n\r\nHold the leaf up to the light, and see if you can discover what they are\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nAh, see those mouth tubes firmly stuck into the leaf. There they stand\r\nall day long and suck out the juice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNed says he should think they would burst.\r\n\r\nBut they do not; they grow. And they also get rid of a large part of the\r\nsuperfluous sap in a curious way.\r\n\r\nThey use what they need to grow on, and the rest escapes from the\r\ninsect\'s body in the form of "honey dew." It is a sweet liquid of which\r\nants and bees are very fond.\r\n\r\nWhat, John, you have heard that the aphids give out honey dew from two\r\nlittle horns near the tip of the abdomen?\r\n\r\nLet us see if we can find these horns. Yes, we can see them plainly, and\r\n_very_ plainly with a magnifying glass.\r\n\r\nBut now listen; the honey dew does not come from the horns. On the end\r\nof some of the horns, or tubes, we can see a drop of clear liquid.\r\n\r\nFor a long time people believed this was honey dew, but instead, it is a\r\nwaxy substance which is not sweet.\r\n\r\nIt has been very carefully studied by wise men who tell us it contains\r\nno sugar and is probably used as a means of defence, as aphides have\r\nbeen seen to smear the faces of insect enemies with this wax.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many species of aphides, and not all of them have the\r\nlittle tubes or horns on their backs. But probably many that have no\r\nhorns give forth honey dew.\r\n\r\nIt is really a waste substance from the body of the aphid.\r\n\r\nAnts are so fond of the honey dew that certain species of aphides have\r\nbeen called the _ants\' cows_, because the ants take care of them for the\r\nsake of the honey dew.\r\n\r\nSome ants protect the aphids from their enemies. They drive off those\r\ninsects that would devour the aphids, and when winter comes these ants\r\ncarry the aphids down into their warm nests under ground, and keep them\r\nsafe through the cold weather.\r\n\r\nThe aphides cannot stand wet weather, but after a long spell of dry\r\nweather they will be found in great abundance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSometimes they eat so fast and so much that the honey dew falls like a\r\nshower from the trees upon which they are. It covers the ground beneath\r\nand the leaves of plants, and makes everything very sticky and\r\ndisagreeable to the touch. The dust settles on it, too and a growth\r\nsomething like mould often turns it black--as we find to our discomfort.\r\n\r\nBut when the honey dew is fresh the bees love it. They collect large\r\nquantities of it and make it into honey. Squirrels like it to.\r\n\r\nIt is great fun to watch the nimble squirrel folk sitting in the trees\r\nand holding a leaf between their little hands while they lick off the\r\nhoney dew.\r\n\r\nChildren sometimes suck the honey dew from the leaves in back country\r\nplaces, where sugar is scarce and where candy is seldom to be had.\r\n\r\nWhich side of the leaf does the aphid prefer?\r\n\r\nYes, it is on the under side always.\r\n\r\nI wonder why.\r\n\r\nJohn says the aphides would be better protected in case of a shower.\r\n\r\nNed says the skin is tenderer on the under side and easier to pierce.\r\n\r\nMollie thinks they want to be in the shade out of the hot sunshine.\r\n\r\nI should not wonder if all of these reasons were right.\r\n\r\nMy little aphid, how many wings have you when you have any?\r\n\r\nYes, little Nell, they have four of the daintiest, prettiest little\r\nwings you ever saw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTrue enough, most of them have no wings at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJohn thinks those must be young ones.\r\n\r\nSometimes they are, but not always. Many of the adult aphids have no\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThe aphids are very curious insects, and when you are older I hope you\r\nwill remember to study them carefully.\r\n\r\nNo, John, not all species of aphides make honey dew.\r\n\r\nSome form instead a white, powdery substance that is seen scattered over\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nMay says that must be the kind she has.\r\n\r\nLet us see. Yes, May\'s aphids produce the white powder instead of honey\r\ndew.\r\n\r\nThat is _their_ way of getting rid of the waste matter.\r\n\r\nMay says she is glad to know that; she thought her aphids had something\r\nthe matter with them. They seemed to be falling to pieces.\r\n\r\nNo, May, they are not falling to pieces; that powder can all be rubbed\r\noff, and there are your aphids whole and sound beneath it.\r\n\r\nDo you know that some species of your funny little tree hoppers secrete\r\nhoney dew also, and even have ants to attend them? See if you can find\r\nsome of these this summer.\r\n\r\nSometimes aphids live on the roots of plants as well as on the leaves.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, May, they are very destructive insects. We have to spray\r\nour house plants to get rid of them, and often our garden flowers as\r\nwell, and they do a great deal of damage to fruits and vegetables, and\r\none of them, the phylloxera, has nearly destroyed the vineyards of\r\nFrance. It lives on the leaves of some species of grapes and on the\r\nroots of others. We have to be very careful about getting grape vines\r\nfrom Europe to plant in this country on account of the phylloxera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhat have you found now, John? Ah, yes, an alder branch, with a white,\r\ncottony substance on it. You have been poking into it with a little\r\nstick, and you think there are insects beneath it.\r\n\r\nWhat, May, you always thought that white stuff was a plant growth, like\r\nmould?\r\n\r\nWe can easily find out. Get out some of the little things inside if you\r\ncan, John. It is not easy to separate them from their cottony covering\r\nwithout crushing them, but now we can see quite well with the magnifying\r\nglass--and yes--you see they are little insects.\r\n\r\nWe call them the woolly aphids.\r\n\r\nThey also secrete honey dew.\r\n\r\nYou say the ground below the alder bush was all sticky and black, John?\r\n\r\nThat was the honey dew, blackened by a little plant something like\r\nmould, that grows on it.\r\n\r\nWe often see woolly plant lice in the summer-time on different plants,\r\nand one species injures apple trees. It gets on the roots as well as on\r\nthe tender bark of young trees and kills them.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, Mollie, the aphids are bugs. They belong to the bug order,\r\nwhich is a very large and important insect family, and contains some\r\nmembers that are exceedingly troublesome to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCALE BUGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, May, you are tired out?\r\n\r\nWhat have you been doing?\r\n\r\nOh, yes, washing the scales off the leaves of your mother\'s window fern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt must indeed have been a task; what did you wash them off with? Why\r\ndid you use soap suds?\r\n\r\nBecause your mother told you to; well, that is a good reason, but why do\r\nyou think she told you to use soap suds?\r\n\r\nYou say you don\'t know, but you think very likely these scales are some\r\nsort of bug, as everything nowadays seems to be bugs.\r\n\r\nWell, I don\'t know about everything being bugs, but those scales\r\ncertainly are. They are scale bugs.\r\n\r\nDid you stop to look at them under the magnifying glass?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNo, but you brought a piece of the fern for us to look at.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to put it under the microscope.\r\n\r\nThere, now look.\r\n\r\nYes, that scale looks like a tiny mussel shell; but look carefully, and\r\nyou will see it has legs.\r\n\r\nLift it up with the point of a pin, and under it you will find a mass of\r\neggs. Yes, Ned; it is like a quantity of eggs under a dish cover.\r\n\r\nThe cover is the female scale bug, and she has laid all those eggs.\r\n\r\nYes, the scales we see on so many plants are the scale bugs.\r\n\r\nThey are not all alike in shape, or size, or color; here is a different\r\nkind, you see.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut they are all very prolific; that is to say, they produce a great\r\nmany young, and do it in a short time.\r\n\r\nYes, John, the tiny, dark-colored scales that look like little oyster\r\nshells on the skins of oranges are a form of scale bug, and a very\r\ntroublesome one, too, to the orange grower.\r\n\r\nBut though most of these insects are troublesome, the family is redeemed\r\nby a few members that are of great value to us.\r\n\r\nOne of these is the scale bug that supplies shellac, and all that comes\r\nfrom it to our markets. These curious bugs give forth a resinous\r\nsubstance that envelops the eggs and glues them to the twigs whose\r\njuices the bug sucks out. It is this resinous substance that is\r\ncollected by breaking off the twigs where the insects are. It is used\r\nfor varnishes, as you know, and for polishing wood and other substances.\r\n\r\nThere are other scale bugs that secrete wax, and some of them produce it\r\nso abundantly, and of such good quality, that it has become an article\r\nof commerce. China wax, which is wax of a very fine quality, is secreted\r\nby a Chinese scale bug, and the wax is used for making fine candles, as\r\nwell as for other purposes.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico we have the cochineal insect, which is a scale bug that lives\r\non a cactus that grows in Mexico.\r\n\r\nLike many others of the scale bugs, the cochineal males have wings and\r\nare not so scalelike as their helpless mates.\r\n\r\nBut they are of no use to us. It is only the female cochineal we use.\r\n\r\nShe is raised in great numbers in cactus gardens planted on purpose.\r\n\r\nHere is the picture of a cactus with cochineal insects upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese insects contain a very brilliant, red coloring matter that is used\r\nby us in dyeing leather and wool, and in making paints. The insects are\r\ngathered and dried, and thus sent to market.\r\n\r\nAlthough a few of them are useful to us, the scale bugs, on the whole,\r\nare a serious pest; and they are found on nearly all kinds of plants all\r\nover the world.\r\n\r\nYou should think all the plants would soon be gone, so many insects eat\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nWell, they would, only other things eat the insects.\r\n\r\nInsects have a great many enemies, after all.\r\n\r\nSometimes the weather is bad for them, the season is too hot or too\r\ncold, too wet or too dry, and then they do not appear in large numbers.\r\n\r\nSometimes one kind of insect eats another kind.\r\n\r\nSometimes tiny plants, like moulds, grow on the insects and kill them;\r\nand birds destroy a very large number.\r\n\r\nIf the farmers only knew how much good the birds do them, they would\r\nnever allow one to be killed. Even the crows that pull up their corn are\r\nworth many times the corn they eat in the insects they destroy. There is\r\nscarcely a bird but what is of value to the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe hawks that catch his chickens catch more mice and moles in his\r\nfields, than chickens in his barn-yard.\r\n\r\nAnd as for the robins, the blue jays, and all the small birds, they do\r\nmore to save the growing plants, than all the soap suds and kerosene\r\nemulsion that were ever made.\r\n\r\nNo one should ever shoot a bird. The birds are our natural protectors\r\nagainst the vast armies of insects, that, but for the birds, would soon\r\ndestroy us by eating up our food plants.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, May? You belong to an Audubon Society for the protection\r\nof the birds?\r\n\r\nYes, I know you do, and so do John and Ned and Mollie and little Nell.\r\n\r\nI wish every child in the United States belonged to the Audubon Society.\r\nThen our birds would be safe. They would never be killed as they are now\r\nfor foolish women to wear on their hats.\r\n\r\nWhen the Audubon Society children grew up they would not wear dead\r\nbirds, of course, and their children would be taught better, so that\r\nafter a while the Audubon Society people would be the only ones left,\r\nand so the birds would be safe.\r\n\r\nLet us get as many people to belong to the Audubon Society as we can.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, Amy? You have learned more interesting things about birds\r\nin the Audubon Society than you ever knew in your life before?\r\n\r\nYes, I am sure you have, and what could be lovelier to study about than\r\nthe birds.\r\n\r\nWhat is that you are saying, Ned? You love to go bird hunting? Ah, I see\r\nyour eyes twinkle, sir; I know how you go hunting. You hunt with your\r\nmother\'s opera glass! That is the proper way to hunt birds.\r\n\r\nWe can learn more from watching one bird with a glass than we could from\r\nshooting a hundred.\r\n\r\nBut you do shoot them, John? Yes, I know about that, too. I know what\r\nkind of a shooting instrument you got for Christmas, sir, and I have\r\nseen the birds you shot!\r\n\r\nYes, nearly all of us have seen them, and how well he does it!\r\n\r\nWhat, Amy, you think John ought to be ashamed of himself to go about\r\nshooting birds, and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves to talk so about\r\nit?\r\n\r\nThere, now, don\'t be vexed with Amy, children. She has known us but a\r\nlittle while, and she has not seen John\'s birds, so I do not wonder she\r\nfeels indignant.\r\n\r\nWhat is that, May? You have one of John\'s birds right here in your\r\nschool-bag? Show it to Amy.\r\n\r\nIsn\'t it pretty! It is a very charming photograph of a catbird on its\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nYou see John shoots birds with a camera! His father gave him a beautiful\r\none for Christmas, and he has made good use of it.\r\n\r\nHow long did it take you to get that bird, John?\r\n\r\nJust hear! He spent more than a week getting acquainted with the bird so\r\nit would sit still on the nest while he took its picture.\r\n\r\nI am sure that was a week well spent.\r\n\r\nJohn says he feels better acquainted with the catbird than he would have\r\nbeen if he had read fifty books about it.\r\n\r\nAnd I am sure he is right. The only way to enjoy a bird and to know it,\r\nis to watch it alive.\r\n\r\nA camera is the very best gun in the world for catching birds. And it is\r\nreally much better fun to take their pictures than to shoot and kill\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me we have strayed a long way from bugs.\r\n\r\nMay says she thinks birds are much more interesting than bugs.\r\n\r\nThat may be, but still we want to know about bugs, too.\r\n\r\nDo you think you will know a bug when you see it now?\r\n\r\nNo, I do not believe you can be sure of that. But at least you know\r\nsomething about a few bugs.\r\n\r\nSome day you will study more carefully how insects are formed, and then\r\nyou will understand better how we decide what order they belong to.\r\n\r\nWe group together the insects that are most like each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ~NEUROPTERA~\r\n\r\n ~TRICHOPTERA~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORNED CORYDALUS\r\n\r\n\r\nNo more bugs, if you please.\r\n\r\nWe are to make the acquaintance of another order of insect folk this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI think we can find some worthy members of this new order if we go with\r\nJohn to a brook he knows of.\r\n\r\nHere we are, and it certainly is a lovely brook, whether we find a\r\ndobson in it or not.\r\n\r\nYes, Nell, the dobson is the new insect we shall try to find.\r\n\r\nNow, be careful and not get your clothes too wet, but we have to turn\r\nover the stones along the edge of the brook until we find what we are\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nMollie wants to know how she is to know it if she finds it.\r\n\r\nWell, Mollie, whatever you find that is interesting you must show us.\r\nEven though it is not what we are searching for, we shall enjoy seeing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLook at little Nell! She has tumbled into the brook. Her foot slipped,\r\nand down she went.\r\n\r\nDon\'t cry, deary, you are not wet enough to do any harm. The warm sun\r\nwill soon dry you.\r\n\r\nNo, indeed, you will not have to go home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will be the first one to find a dobson after all.\r\n\r\nHurrah! hurrah! hear John shout!\r\n\r\nHe must have found the first dobson.\r\n\r\nYes, he has.\r\n\r\nWhat, May? It is a horrid monster, and you have a good mind to scream?\r\n\r\nWell, scream if you want to; that won\'t do any harm.\r\n\r\nIt _isn\'t_ pretty! but we shall like to look at it. You see it is a\r\nlarva and a big one, dark gray in color and with a thick leathery skin.\r\n\r\nMollie says it reminds her a little of the larva of the May fly; that\r\nis, in shape.\r\n\r\nLet us look at a picture of the May-fly larva.\r\n\r\nYou see it has a head, a thorax to which is attached the six legs and\r\nthe rudimentary wings, and an abdomen, all distinctly separated from\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe dobson has a head, but no thorax.\r\n\r\nThe body behind the head is divided into segments that all look very\r\nmuch alike, and there is a pair of legs attached to each of the first\r\nthree segments.\r\n\r\nThe dobson eats other larv\xc3\xa6 that it chews up with its strong jaws.\r\n\r\nIt lives almost three years in the larval state, so you see it has\r\nplenty of time in which to grow. Of course it moults. It is usually to\r\nbe found under stones in swift, running water. Those two pairs of hooks\r\nat the tip of its body are its anchors.\r\n\r\nIt clasps them about a bit of stone or a stick that is firmly lodged,\r\nand then it can bid defiance to the swirling stream.\r\n\r\nNed wonders why it is always found hiding under stones.\r\n\r\nListen to John, he says fishes are very fond of dobsons, and that is why\r\nthey hide away.\r\n\r\nFishermen hunt the dobsons for bait; so you see they have a hard time in\r\nspite of their large size and their strong jaws.\r\n\r\nWhen they have lived nearly three years in the water they crawl out on\r\nthe bank and hollow out a place under a stone.\r\n\r\nHere they lie, apparently dead, but they are not dead.\r\n\r\nThey are undergoing a wonderful transformation.\r\n\r\nIt takes about a month for this transformation, or _metamorphosis_, as\r\nit is called, to be completed.\r\n\r\nAll of our other insect friends have changed gradually from larval to\r\nadult form. At each moult they became a little more like their parents,\r\nand finally at the last moult, without any resting period, out sprang\r\nthe perfect insect.\r\n\r\nNot so the dobson. It goes into its hole in the bank a larva, almost\r\nexactly like the larva that hatched from the egg, only, of course, it is\r\nlarger. There is no hint of wings. It has no separate thorax and\r\nabdomen. Could we see under the bank where it has crept, to undergo its\r\ngreat metamorphosis, we should find, not a larva, but a strange-looking,\r\nmotionless object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHere is the picture of one. See its little wing pads. And now it has a\r\nthorax and an abdomen.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have changed and been turned to some hard substance.\r\n\r\nIn this state it is called the _pupa_, which means doll. Is it not a\r\ncunning insect doll? But it is not really a doll. Although so still and\r\napparently lifeless, yet it lives.\r\n\r\nSome day it will burst its pupa shell and pull itself out--not a larva\r\nnow, not a pupa, but a strong-winged insect.\r\n\r\nIn its adult form, it is known as the horned corydalus.\r\n\r\nThere! I thought John was saving one for us. He had it in a box in his\r\npocket. Now see what a--a--what shall I say? A beauty? or a monster?\r\nThat is just as you feel about it.\r\n\r\nIt certainly is an alarming-looking insect.\r\n\r\nThis one is a male, as we can tell by the long, curved jaws that look\r\nvery dangerous; but in this instance the creature\'s appearance is worse\r\nthan its bite, and the real biter is the female whose jaws are smaller\r\nbut very useful in nipping tormentors or biting prey.\r\n\r\nNow here she is--a fit mate for her formidable-looking companion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MALE CORYDALUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEMALE CORYDALUS.]\r\n\r\nJohn, you were fortunate in your hunting.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its terrifying appearance, see what wonderful wings the\r\ncorydalus has.\r\n\r\nSee! John has spread out the wings of the female.\r\n\r\nThey are indeed beautiful.\r\n\r\nMay cannot understand how those great wings came out of those little\r\nwing pads.\r\n\r\nWhen the wings were first pulled out of the wing pads they were small,\r\nbut they rapidly expanded and became thin and broad and long as the air\r\ntouched them.\r\n\r\nYou will understand that better after a while.\r\n\r\nThe corydalus differs from all the other insects we have studied, in its\r\nmetamorphosis.\r\n\r\nIt begins life far more unlike its parents than the other insects we\r\nhave been looking at, for they had the thorax and abdomen distinct from\r\nthe beginning. Instead of changing gradually and remaining active all\r\nthe time up to the final metamorphosis, our corydalus goes into the pupa\r\nstate, and in that motionless condition transforms to the perfect\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nThis is called a complete metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nWhen the change is gradual, without any pupa form, any stopping place as\r\nit were, the change is said to be an incomplete metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nYes, the metamorphosis of the grasshoppers is incomplete, and of the\r\nkatydids and the crickets and all the other insects we have studied\r\nuntil we came to the dobson.\r\n\r\nAnother name for the larva of insects that undergo an incomplete\r\nmetamorphosis is _nymph_. Some books speak of the nymph of the\r\ngrasshopper, and never of the larva of the grasshopper. Such books use\r\nthe word _larva_ only in speaking of the young of insects that undergo a\r\ncomplete metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nYes, Ned, they would speak of the nymph of the dragon fly, and the nymph\r\nof the May fly and the nymph of the cricket and the katydid, but they\r\nwould speak of the larva of the corydalus.\r\n\r\nEgg, nymph, adult,--those are the stages of insects that have an\r\nincomplete metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nEgg, larva, pupa, adult,--those are the stages of insects that have a\r\ncomplete metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nNo, it is not wrong to say larva instead of nymph. I only want you to\r\nknow how the word nymph is used, so that when you see it in reading\r\nabout insects you will know what it means.\r\n\r\nThe corydalus lays its eggs near the water, and it lays a great\r\nmany--sometimes nearly three thousand. Think of that! The young larv\xc3\xa6\r\ncrawl into the water as soon as they are hatched, and those that escape\r\nthe hungry fishes grow into these large larv\xc3\xa6 and finally metamorphose\r\ninto the big-horned corydalus.\r\n\r\nIt is such a remarkably fierce-looking creature that it has received\r\nmany names that are neither complimentary nor beautiful, such as\r\nconniption bug, alligator, and dragon, and numerous others equally\r\nexpressive.\r\n\r\nNow, we must go home. Let us put the dobson back into the brook.\r\n\r\nIt does no harm, and we will not kill it.\r\n\r\nYes, Ned, there are smaller insects like the corydalus that are near\r\nrelatives to it, and I am sure you have often seen them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAIRY LACEWING\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is our little Lacewing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMay says it is a darling, like a woodland fairy clad all in green.\r\n\r\nAnd, oh, its eyes! Are they not beautiful? They shine like gold.\r\n\r\nDo its wings not remind you a little of the wings of the corydalus?\r\n\r\nMay says no, indeed; that has ugly brown wings.\r\n\r\nBut look again, May. See how these wings are veined, and do you not\r\nremember how you admired the silvery wings of the corydalus when we\r\nspread them out?\r\n\r\nYes, it belongs to the same order as the corydalus.\r\n\r\nThe name of the insect order to which they both belong is Neuroptera,\r\nfrom _neuron_, a nerve, and _pteron_--who remembers what _pteron_ means?\r\n\r\nYes, a wing. Nerve-winged.\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean?\r\n\r\nIt means that the wings are crossed by many nerves or veins. Yes, that\r\nis what gives them their lacelike appearance.\r\n\r\nPretty golden eye, why do we not oftener see you on the trees and\r\nbushes? It is only by accident we found you to-day, down in the grass.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, this pretty fairy hides by day and comes out at night to\r\nlay its eggs. Like the May fly, the adult lacewing does not eat. It is a\r\nhelpless little beauty, though it has one powerful means of defence, as\r\nyou will discover if you touch it.\r\n\r\nAh, yes; you have already detected it! It gives forth such an offensive\r\nodor that nothing, one should think, could have the hardihood to eat it.\r\n\r\nMay says she supposes the larva of the lacewing is a little monster like\r\nthat of the corydalus.\r\n\r\nBut you will not expect to find it as large as a dobson.\r\n\r\nI think if we hunt about a little, we can find one.\r\n\r\nHere is one on the leaf. See what a little fellow! And how fast it runs!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe shall have to take it captive, in order to get a chance to see it.\r\n\r\nIt is a funny little larva, with jaws that are _tre-men-dous_ for one of\r\nits size.\r\n\r\nWhy do you suppose it has such jaws?\r\n\r\nMay says, for the usual reason, to eat up other larv\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nYes; but wait till I tell you another name for this larva.\r\n\r\nIt is also called the aphis lion.\r\n\r\nAphis, you know, is the same as aphid, or plant louse. In other words it\r\nis the plant-louse lion.\r\n\r\nAh, yes; you are quite willing it should devour the aphids.\r\n\r\nAnd it does. It is very fond of them, though it will also devour any\r\nunlucky insect it is strong enough to overcome.\r\n\r\nIt has a terrible appetite, this child of the pretty lacewing.\r\n\r\nIt would even eat its brothers and sisters before they hatched out of\r\nthe egg if it could get at them.\r\n\r\nThe pretty lacewing knows what an appetite her ever hungry larv\xc3\xa6 will\r\nhave, and so she protects them against each other.\r\n\r\nClever little mother! she lays the eggs in such a way that the larv\xc3\xa6\r\nthat hatch out first cannot devour the rest of the eggs.\r\n\r\nHow do you think she manages it?\r\n\r\nHere are some of her eggs on this leaf.\r\n\r\nYes, John; each one is on top of a slender stalk.\r\n\r\nThe stalk is of stiff silk.\r\n\r\nThere they are, like a little forest, with an egg for each tree top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen an egg hatches the young aphis lion drops down to the leaf and runs\r\nabout like a ravening lion seeking some living thing to devour.\r\n\r\nAbove his head, quite unsuspected by him, are the eggs out of which his\r\nbrothers and sisters have not yet hatched.\r\n\r\nWhat a feast he could have if he knew about it!\r\n\r\nAnd what a sad little cannibal he would be!\r\n\r\nThe larva of the aphis lion has no distinct thorax. Its legs are\r\nattached to the upper segments of the body, and its metamorphosis is\r\nlike that of the corydalus.\r\n\r\nWhen about to become a pupa, it makes for itself a little covering of\r\nwhite silk. Here it lies quite motionless and undergoes the final\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\nYes, its metamorphosis is complete.\r\n\r\nIt bites an opening through its silken walls, and out steps--not the\r\nhungry, little, all-devouring aphis lion, but this elegant lady with her\r\npale-green lacelike wings and her large, golden eyes.\r\n\r\nYou see the aphis lion is our very good friend.\r\n\r\nIt helps us get rid of the aphids, and we should never kill a lacewing\r\nor a child of the lacewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANT LION\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn has found something he wants us all to see.\r\n\r\nWe will go with him.\r\n\r\nNow we will sit down on this sand bank and look at what he has to show\r\nus. See! those smooth little funnels in the sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThose are what we have come out to see.\r\n\r\nLet us watch them a while.\r\n\r\nMollie says an ant is walking close to the rim of the funnel she is\r\nwatching. Now the ant slips over the edge and slides down the smooth\r\nsides of the funnel.\r\n\r\nAnd see! from the bottom of the funnel leap out two curved jaws\r\nand--good-by, ant!\r\n\r\nThe ant has been dragged down out of sight through a hole in the bottom\r\nof the funnel.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange proceeding!\r\n\r\nWho can be living down there at the bottom of the funnel?\r\n\r\nWe are sorry to disturb such a pretty piece of work, but we shall have\r\nto dig out one of the funnels. We shall have to be quick, too.\r\n\r\nThere, there, under the trowel! No, it is gone. There it is again. Dig\r\nfast, Ned. That is right. He has put it with a trowelful of sand into\r\nour box.\r\n\r\nWe will gently shake out the sand until we uncover it.\r\n\r\nMabel says it is just what she thought it was--a larva.\r\n\r\nYes, it is a larva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYou see it looks a little like the lacewing larva, and it, too, belongs\r\nto the Neuroptera.\r\n\r\nWhat jaws!\r\n\r\nHow do you suppose it makes its tunnel?\r\n\r\nIf we give it plenty of sand, and keep very quiet, perhaps it will go to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThere! it is throwing the sand about.\r\n\r\nMay says it is using its own head as a trowel. Yes, it is shovelling the\r\nsand away with its head.\r\n\r\nWhy is Ned laughing? Oh, see the ant lion he is watching! An ant slid\r\npart way down its funnel and tried to climb out again, and the ant lion\r\ndown below is flinging sand at it.\r\n\r\nThere! it has succeeded in making the poor ant slip; down it goes, and\r\nnow the ant lion has seized it and dragged it down under the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to find these pit-falls of the ant lion in sand banks in the\r\nsummer-time.\r\n\r\nYes, May, the ant lions eat many ants, and they moult and grow, and,\r\nfinally, they, too, make a little cocoon about themselves.\r\n\r\nYes, the little silken room they weave we call a cocoon, but the ant\r\nlions make theirs of silk and sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWithin the cocoon they become motionless pup\xc3\xa6, and finally appear as\r\nsilver-winged little creatures that bear no resemblance to the\r\nlarge-jawed, ever hungry, ant lion.\r\n\r\nMay says she thinks the Neuroptera differ from all the other orders in\r\nthe way the larv\xc3\xa6 transform.\r\n\r\nThat is true, May, they do.\r\n\r\nIn no other order that we have studied do the insects go into the pupal\r\nstate to undergo the final transformation.\r\n\r\nWho remembers what the young of insects that undergo an incomplete\r\nmetamorphosis are sometimes called?\r\n\r\nDear me, you all remember!\r\n\r\nYes, the young are sometimes called nymphs.\r\n\r\nThe nymphs do not change into pup\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nThe young grasshoppers do not change into motionless pup\xc3\xa6, they just\r\nkeep on growing until they are perfect adults.\r\n\r\nYoung grasshoppers are sometimes called nymphs instead of larv\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE CADDICE FLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we are in the woods again.\r\n\r\nHow sweet it smells!\r\n\r\nLet us sit down by this brook and look into it.\r\n\r\nIt is such a clear little stream, with fine sand and little pebbles at\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\nWhat has Nell found that pleases her so?\r\n\r\nShe says she sees some little bars of sand moving about.\r\n\r\nNed says they are not sand bars but tubes of sand, containing a little\r\nlive thing.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, this sand bag is a house, and its occupant is a larva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSee the black head come popping out, and the tiny fore legs.\r\n\r\nThe larva does not come entirely out, you see, but pulls its house along\r\nwith it, and when it is frightened it pops back into its little stone\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nMollie says it reminds her of a hermit crab.\r\n\r\nA hermit crab, you know, lives on the seashore and takes possession of\r\nan empty snail shell for a house.\r\n\r\nIt comes partly out dragging its house with it, but if you disturb it,\r\nit draws back, sometimes quite out of sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis little larva lives in a house, too, but it is a house of its own\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nIt is the larva of the caddice fly, or case fly.\r\n\r\nLet us put one of these little sand cases in the saucer here.\r\n\r\nPlease fill the saucer about half full of water, John. Thank you.\r\n\r\nNow, Mollie, I see you have picked up a fine big caddice case.\r\n\r\nPut it in the saucer, and let us watch the larva crawl about.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt never comes entirely out of the case, you see. It holds on to it with\r\nthe hinder part of its body.\r\n\r\nIts little black head is hard, but its body is soft, and that is why it\r\ndoes not like to expose itself to hungry larv\xc3\xa6 that might be living in\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nMay says she wants to see the whole larva.\r\n\r\nSuppose we carefully break away the little sand case.\r\n\r\nNo, indeed, little Nell, we are not going to hurt the larva; we are only\r\ngoing to open its house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere, the larva is outside now, and you can see what a tender, pale\r\nlittle thing it is.\r\n\r\nIt does not like to have its soft body exposed.\r\n\r\nSee! it is already gathering little bits of sand together.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be sticking them fast to its body.\r\n\r\nIt is really binding them together by a saliva-like substance from its\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nIt draws out little glistening threads that harden into silk as soon as\r\nthey touch the water.\r\n\r\nQueer saliva you think.\r\n\r\nBut the caddice larva does not find it queer. It is used to saliva that\r\nhardens into silk.\r\n\r\nYes, that is the way the larva of the aphis lion and of the ant lion\r\nmade their cocoons. They spun out silk in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe caddice larva makes its house of silk and sand and also lines it\r\nwith a beautiful covering of fine silk.\r\n\r\nYes, May, it papers its walls with silk.\r\n\r\nYou see it did not hurt the caddice larva to take away its house; it\r\nimmediately went to work to build another.\r\n\r\nWhy not pull it out, instead of breaking its house to pieces?\r\n\r\nBecause if it had been pulled hard enough to come out, it might have\r\nbeen torn to pieces, it is such a tender little thing, and it holds fast\r\nso tightly.\r\n\r\nSo the best way to remove it safely is to break its case bit by bit from\r\naround it.\r\n\r\nIt does no harm to break its case if one is careful. It will soon build\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nYes, this larva has no distinct thorax. It is like the larv\xc3\xa6 of the\r\ndobson, the aphis lion, and the ant lion in that respect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSee! John has found one whose tube is made of quite large stones as\r\ncompared with this tube of fine sand that we have broken open.\r\n\r\nSome caddice larv\xc3\xa6 build houses of wood instead of stone. They stick\r\nlittle twigs together, and some use little pieces of leaves.\r\n\r\nOthers again use tiny snail shells which, as you can imagine, make very\r\npretty cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOur little caddice has made a neat little house of fine sand grains very\r\nnicely put together.\r\n\r\nSome others make much rougher houses.\r\n\r\nYou will be apt to find the caddice larv\xc3\xa6 in any brook and in some\r\nponds, and I hope you will always look for them.\r\n\r\nNotice the tracery in the soft mud of the brook.\r\n\r\nThose lines that look as though some one had been ornamenting the bottom\r\nof the brook are made by our caddice larv\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey drag their cases along and thus make these lines.\r\n\r\nSometimes such lines are made by the little fresh-water snails; but you\r\ncan always find the decorator by following along the lines he makes.\r\n\r\nWhat, May? How is the delicate larva able to cling to the case tightly\r\nenough to pull it along? If you look at it very carefully, you will find\r\na pair of tiny hooks at the tail end by which it can hold on to the silk\r\nlining; and some caddice larv\xc3\xa6 have hard points on their backs which\r\nhelp them to hold fast.\r\n\r\nThe caddice larv\xc3\xa6 are carnivorous; that is, they eat animal food.\r\n\r\nYes, May, their food is usually the larv\xc3\xa6 of other insects, but you will\r\nbe glad to know that some of them eat plants too.\r\n\r\nThey eat the larv\xc3\xa6 of the May flies when they can find them and no doubt\r\nthey build these strong cases about themselves to prevent the May fly\r\nlarv\xc3\xa6 from returning the compliment.\r\n\r\nFrank has found some empty cases, yes, and some that are closed at both\r\nends.\r\n\r\nNow, let us look at this one closed at both ends. What do you suppose is\r\nin it?\r\n\r\nWe will open just one of these closed cases.\r\n\r\nThere! It is a pupa! Yes, Nell, a very pretty doll is this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt has a thorax, you see, and an abdomen. Its long antenn\xc3\xa6 lie close to\r\nits body as do its little wing pads.\r\n\r\nYes, the caddice larva grows and moults in the usual way. It keeps\r\nadding to its house as it grows longer. Finally, it closes the end of\r\nits little tube and lies quite still.\r\n\r\nYou know what happens next. Its wormlike form divides into thorax and\r\nabdomen. Legs and wings appear, attached to the thorax. In short, it is\r\nno longer a wormlike creature.\r\n\r\nFinally, it comes forth from its case. It never goes into it again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt does not need to, for now it is a dainty little nun, with a long,\r\ntan-colored cloak. Its cloak, of course, is its wings folded down about\r\nits body. Like the fairy May flies it has no mouth and eats nothing in\r\nthe adult form.\r\n\r\nIt looks like a dainty brown moth as it flutters about the bushes and\r\ngoes flying up and down the brook.\r\n\r\nYou will always find these little brown-cloaked figures flitting about\r\nthe brooks, where the caddice larv\xc3\xa6 live.\r\n\r\nYou see the caddice undergoes a complete metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nNo, it does not belong to the Neuroptera.\r\n\r\nExamine its wings very carefully. Look at them through the magnifying\r\nglass, and you will see they are clothed with hairs.\r\n\r\nSo these are the hair wings.\r\n\r\nThe name of the order to which they belong is Trichoptera, from\r\n_pteron_, a wing, and _thrix_, a hair.\r\n\r\nSometime you must take a caddice larva from its house and put it in a\r\nsaucer of water with fine bits of mica, which you know is another name\r\nfor the isinglass that makes the little windows in our stoves.\r\n\r\nIf you are fortunate, your caddice will build for itself a little glass\r\nhouse, through whose walls you can look and see what is going on inside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|Transcribers note: In this text letters with a macron or breve are     |\r\n|represented thus:                                                      |\r\n|                                                                       |\r\n|                                                                       |\r\n|"a" with a macron [=a] "a" with a breve [)a]                           |\r\n|"e" with a macron [=e] "e" with a breve [)e]                           |\r\n|                                                                       |\r\n|"i" with a macron [=i] "i" with a breve [)i]                           |\r\n|"o" with a macron [=o] "o" with a breve [)o]                           |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY\r\n\r\n\r\n~Abdomen~ (ab-d[=o]\'-men).

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n'
