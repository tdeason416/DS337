Blake\r\nPrincipal, Girls\' Department Public School No. 6, New York City\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nGeorgia Alexander\r\nSupervising Principal, Indianapolis, Indiana\r\n\r\n\r\n1906\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nPoetry is the chosen language of childhood and youth. The baby\r\nrepeats words again and again for the mere joy of their sound:\r\nthe melody of nursery rhymes gives a delight which is quite\r\nindependent of the meaning of the words. Not until youth approaches\r\nmaturity is there an equal pleasure in the rounded periods of\r\nelegant prose. It is in childhood therefore that the young mind\r\nshould be stored with poems whose rhythm will be a present delight\r\nand whose beautiful thoughts will not lose their charm in later\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe selections for the lowest grades are addressed primarily to\r\nthe feeling for verbal beauty, the recognition of which in the\r\nmind of the child is fundamental to the plan of this work. The\r\neditors have felt that the inclusion of critical notes in these\r\nlittle books intended for elementary school children would be not\r\nonly superfluous, but, in the degree in which critical comment\r\ndrew the child\'s attention from the text, subversive of the desired\r\nresult. Nor are there any notes on methods. The best way to teach\r\nchildren to love a poem is to read it inspiringly to them.\r\nThe French say: "The ear is the pathway to the heart." A poem\r\nshould be so read that it will sing itself in the hearts of the\r\nlistening children.\r\n\r\nIn the brief biographies appended to the later books the human\r\nelement has been brought out. An effort has been made to call\r\nattention to the education of the poet and his equipment for his\r\nlife work rather than to the literary qualities of his style.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST HALF YEAR\r\n\r\nGood Name                                _William Shakespeare_\r\nFrom "Love\'s Labor\'s Lost".              _William Shakespeare_\r\nFrom "Richard II," Act II, Sc.

I have ventured,\r\nLike little wanton boys that swim on bladders,\r\nThis many summers in a sea of glory,\r\nBut far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride\r\nAt length broke under me; and now has left me,\r\nWeary and old with service, to the mercy\r\nOf a rude stream, that must forever hide me.\r\nVain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:\r\nI feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched\r\nIs that poor man that hangs on princes\' favors!\r\nThere is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,\r\nThat sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,\r\nMore pangs and fears than wars or women have:\r\nAnd when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,\r\nNever to hope again.\r\n\r\n--From "HENRY VIII."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBEN JONSON\r\nENGLAND,

inspire\r\nMirth and youth and warm desire!\r\nWoods and groves are of thy dressing,\r\nHill and dale doth boast thy blessing.\r\nThus we salute thee with our early song,\r\nAnd welcome thee, and wish

he\r\nOf famous London town.\r\n\r\nJohn Gilpin\'s spouse said to her dear,\r\n\'Though wedded we have been\r\nThese twice ten tedious years, yet we\r\nNo holiday have seen.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow is our wedding day,\r\nAnd we will then repair\r\nUnto the Bell at Edmonton\r\nAll in a chaise and pair.\r\n\r\n"My sister, and my sister\'s child,\r\nMyself, and children three,\r\nWill fill the chaise; so you must ride\r\nOn horseback after we."\r\n\r\nHe soon replied, "I do admire\r\nOf womankind but one,\r\nAnd you are she, my dearest dear,\r\nTherefore it shall be done.\r\n\r\n"I am a linendraper bold,\r\nAs all the world doth know,\r\nAnd my good friend the calender\r\nWill lend his horse to go."\r\n\r\nQuoth Mrs. Gilpin, "That\'s well said;\r\nAnd for that wine is dear,\r\nWe will be furnished with our own,\r\nWhich is both bright and clear."\r\n\r\nJohn Gilpin kiss\'d his loving wife;\r\nO\'erjoyed was he to find,\r\nThat, though on pleasure she was bent,\r\nShe had a frugal mind.\r\n\r\nThe morning came, the chaise was brought,\r\nBut yet was not allow\'d\r\nTo drive up to the door, lest all\r\nShould say that she was proud.\r\n\r\nSo three doors off the chaise was stay\'d,\r\nWhere they did all get in;\r\nSix precious souls, and all agog\r\nTo dash through thick and thin.\r\n\r\nSmack went the whip, round went the wheels,\r\nWere never folks so glad,\r\nThe stones did rattle underneath,\r\nAs if Cheapside were mad.\r\n\r\nJohn Gilpin at his horse\'s side\r\nSeized fast the flowing mane,\r\nAnd up he got, in haste to ride,\r\nBut soon came down again;\r\n\r\nFor saddletree scarce reach\'d had he\r\nHis journey to begin,\r\nWhen, turning round his head, he saw\r\nThree customers come in.\r\n\r\nSo down he came; for loss of time,\r\nAlthough it grieved him sore,\r\nYet loss of pence, full well he knew,\r\nWould trouble him much more.\r\n\r\n\'Twas long before the customers\r\nWere suited to their mind,\r\nWhen Betty screaming came downstairs,\r\n"The wine is left behind!"\r\n\r\n"Good lack!" quoth he--"yet bring it me,\r\nMy leathern belt likewise,\r\nIn which I bear my trusty sword\r\nWhen I do exercise."\r\n\r\nNow Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)\r\nHad two stone bottles found,\r\nTo hold the liquor that she loved\r\nAnd keep it safe and sound.\r\n\r\nThen over all, that he might be\r\nEquipp\'d from top to toe,\r\nHis long red cloak, well brush\'d and neat,\r\nHe manfully did throw.\r\n\r\nNow see him mounted once again\r\nUpon his nimble steed,\r\nFull slowly pacing o\'er the stones,\r\nWith caution and good heed.\r\n\r\nBut finding soon a smoother road\r\nBeneath his well-shod feet,\r\nThe snorting beast began to trot,\r\nWhich gall\'d him in his seat.\r\n\r\n"So, fair and softly," John he cried,\r\nBut John he cried in vain;\r\nThat trot became a gallop soon,\r\nIn spite of curb and rein.\r\n\r\nSo stooping down, as needs he must\r\nWho cannot sit upright,\r\nHe grasp\'d the mane with both his hands,\r\nAnd eke with all his might.\r\n\r\nHis horse, who never in that sort\r\nHad handled been before,\r\nWhat thing upon his back had got\r\nDid wonder more and more.\r\n\r\nAway went Gilpin, neck or nought;\r\nAway went hat and wig;\r\nHe little dreamt, when he set out,\r\nOf running such a rig.\r\n\r\nThe wind did blow, the cloak did fly,\r\nLike streamer long and gay,\r\nTill, loop and button failing both,\r\nAt last it flew away.\r\n\r\nThen might all people well discern\r\nThe bottles he had slung;\r\nA bottle swinging at each side,\r\nAs hath been said or sung.\r\n\r\nThe dogs did bark, the children scream\'d,\r\nUp flew the windows all;\r\nAnd every soul cried out, "Well done!"\r\nAs loud as he could bawl.\r\n\r\nAway went Gilpin--who but he?\r\nHis fame soon spread around,\r\n"He carries weight! he rides a race!\r\n\'Tis for a thousand pound!"\r\n\r\nAnd still as fast as he drew near,\r\n\'Twas wonderful to view,\r\nHow in a trice the turnpike men\r\nTheir gates wide open threw.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as he went bowing down\r\nHis reeking head full low,\r\nThe bottles twain behind his back\r\nWere shatter\'d at a blow.\r\n\r\nDown ran the wine into the road,\r\nMost piteous to be seen,\r\nWhich made his horse\'s flanks to smoke\r\nAs they had basted been.\r\n\r\nBut still he seem\'d to carry weight,\r\nWith leathern girdle braced;\r\nFor all might see the bottle necks\r\nStill dangling at his waist.\r\n\r\nThus all through merry Islington\r\nThese gambols did he play,\r\nUntil he came unto the Wash\r\nOf Edmonton so gay;\r\n\r\nAnd there he threw the wash about\r\nOn both sides of the way,\r\nJust like unto a trundling mop,\r\nOr a wild goose at play.\r\n\r\nAt Edmonton his loving wife\r\nFrom the balcony spied\r\nHer tender husband, wondering much\r\nTo see how he did ride.\r\n\r\n"Stop, stop, John Gilpin!--here\'s the house,"\r\nThey all at once did cry;\r\n"The dinner waits, and we are tired:"\r\nSaid Gilpin--"So am I!"\r\n\r\nBut yet his horse was not a whit\r\nInclined to tarry there;\r\nFor why?--his owner had a house\r\nFull ten miles off, at Ware.\r\n\r\nSo like an arrow swift he flew,\r\nShot by an archer strong;\r\nSo did he fly--which brings me to\r\nThe middle of my song.\r\n\r\nAway went Gilpin out of breath,\r\nAnd sore against his will,\r\nTill at his friend the calender\'s\r\nHis horse at last stood still.\r\n\r\nThe calender, amazed to see\r\nHis neighbor in such trim,\r\nLaid down his pipe, flew to the gate,\r\nAnd thus accosted him:\r\n\r\n"What news? what news? your tidings tell\r\nTell me you must and shall--\r\nSay why bareheaded you are come,\r\nOr why you come at all?"\r\n\r\nNow Gilpin had a pleasant wit,\r\nAnd loved a timely joke;\r\nAnd thus unto the calender\r\nIn merry guise he spoke:\r\n\r\n"I came because your horse would come;\r\nAnd, if I well forbode,\r\nMy hat and wig will soon be here,\r\nThey are upon the road."\r\n\r\nThe calender, right glad to find\r\nHis friend in merry pin,\r\nReturn\'d him not a single word,\r\nBut to the house went in;\r\n\r\nWhence straight he came with hat and wig,\r\nA wig that flow\'d behind,\r\nA hat not much the worse for wear,\r\nEach comely in its kind.\r\n\r\nHe held them up, and in his turn\r\nThus show\'d his ready wit,\r\n"My head is twice as big as yours,\r\nThey therefore needs must fit.\r\n\r\n"But let me scrape the dirt away\r\nThat hangs upon your face;\r\nAnd stop and eat, for well you may\r\nBe in a hungry case."\r\n\r\nSaid John, "It is my wedding day,\r\nAnd all the world would stare,\r\nIf wife should dine at Edmonton,\r\nAnd I should dine at Ware."\r\n\r\nSo turning to his horse, he said,\r\n"I am in haste to dine;\r\n\'Twas for your pleasure you came here,\r\nYou shall go back for mine."\r\n\r\nAh luckless speech, and bootless boast!\r\nFor which he paid full dear;\r\nFor, while he spake, a braying ass\r\nDid sing most loud and clear;\r\n\r\nWhereat his horse did snort, as he\r\nHad heard a lion roar,\r\nAnd gallop\'d off with all his might,\r\nAs he had done before.\r\n\r\nAway went Gilpin, and away\r\nWent Gilpin\'s hat and wig:\r\nHe lost them sooner than at first,\r\nFor why?--they were too big.\r\n\r\nNow Mistress Gilpin, when she saw\r\nHer husband posting down\r\nInto the country far away,\r\nShe pull\'d out half a crown;\r\n\r\nAnd thus unto the youth she said,\r\nThat drove them to the Bell,\r\n"This shall be yours, when you bring back\r\nMy husband safe and well."\r\n\r\nThe youth did ride, and soon did meet\r\nJohn coming back amain;\r\nWhom in a trice he tried to stop,\r\nBy catching at his rein;\r\n\r\nBut not performing what he meant,\r\nAnd gladly would have done,\r\nThe frighted steed he frighted more,\r\nAnd made him faster run.\r\n\r\nAway went Gilpin, and away\r\nWent postboy at his heels,\r\nThe postboy\'s horse right glad to miss\r\nThe lumbering of the wheels.\r\n\r\nSix gentlemen upon the road,\r\nThus seeing Gilpin fly,\r\nWith postboy scampering in the rear,\r\nThey raised the hue and cry:--\r\n\r\n"Stop thief! stop thief!--a highwayman!"\r\nNot one of them was mute;\r\nAnd all and each that passed that way\r\nDid join in the pursuit.\r\n\r\nAnd now the turnpike gates again\r\nFlew open in short space;\r\nThe toll-men thinking as before,\r\nThat Gilpin rode a race.\r\n\r\nAnd so he did, and won it too,\r\nFor he got first to town;\r\nNor stopp\'d till where he had got up\r\nHe did again get down.\r\n\r\nNow let us sing, "Long live the king,\r\nAnd Gilpin long live he;"\r\nAnd when he next doth ride abroad,\r\nMay I be there to see!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROBERT BURNS\r\nSCOTLAND, 1759-1796\r\n\r\nBANNOCKBURN\r\n\r\nROBERT BRUCE\'S ADDRESS TO HIS

to reposing bands\r\nOf travelers in some shady haunt\r\nAmong Arabian sands:\r\nA voice so thrilling ne\'er was heard\r\nIn springtime from the cuckoo-bird,\r\nBreaking the silence of the

more humble lay,\r\nFamiliar matter of to-day,\r\nSome natural sorrow, loss, or pain,\r\nThat has been, and may be again?\r\n\r\nWhate\'er the theme, the maiden sang\r\nAs if her song could have no ending;\r\nI saw her singing at her work,\r\nAnd o\'er the sickle bending.\r\nI listened motionless and still;\r\nAnd, as I mounted up the hill,\r\nThe music in my heart I bore\r\nLong after it was

border his steed was the best;\r\nAnd save his good broad-sword he weapon had none;\r\nHe rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone.\r\nSo faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,\r\nThere never was knight like the young Lochinvar.\r\n\r\nHe stayed not for brake, and he stopp\'d not for stone,\r\nHe swam the Eske River where ford there was none;\r\nBut ere he alighted at Netherby gate,\r\nThe bride had consented, the gallant came late;\r\nFor a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,\r\nWas to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.\r\n\r\nSo boldly he enter\'d the Netherby Hall,\r\nAmong bride\'s-men, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all:\r\nThen spoke the bride\'s father, his hand on his sword,\r\n(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,)\r\n"O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,\r\nOr to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?"--\r\n\r\n"I long woo\'d your daughter, my suit you denied;--\r\nLove swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide--\r\nAnd now am I come, with this lost love of mine,\r\nTo lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.\r\nThere are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,\r\nThat would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar."\r\n\r\nThe bride kiss\'d the goblet: the knight took it up,\r\nHe quaff\'d off the wine, and he threw down the cup.\r\nShe look\'d down to blush, and she look\'d up to sigh,\r\nWith a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.\r\nHe took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,--\r\n"Now tread we a measure!" said young Lochinvar.\r\n\r\nSo stately his form, and so lovely her face,\r\nThat never a hall such a galliard did grace;\r\nWhile her mother did fret, and her father did fume,\r\nAnd the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;\r\nAnd the bride-maidens whisper\'d, "\'Twere better by far,\r\nTo have match\'d our fair cousin with young Lochinvar."\r\n\r\nOne touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,\r\nWhen they reach\'d the hall-door, and the charger stood near:\r\nSo light to the croup the fair lady he swung,\r\nSo light to the saddle before her he sprung!\r\n"She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur;\r\nThey\'ll have fleet steeds that follow," quoth young Lochinvar.\r\n\r\nThere was mounting \'mong Graemes of the Netherby clan;\r\nFosters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran:\r\nThere was racing and chasing, on Cannobie Lee,\r\nBut the lost bride of Netherby ne\'er did they see.\r\nSo daring in love, and so dauntless in war,\r\nHave ye e\'er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?\r\n\r\n       *       *

bombs bursting in air,\r\nGave proof through the night that our flag was still there.\r\nO! say, does the star-spangled banner yet wave\r\nO\'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?\r\n\r\nOn that shore dimly see through the mists of the deep\r\nWhere the foe\'s haughty host in dread silence reposes,\r\nWhat is that which the breeze, o\'er the towering steep,\r\nAs it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?\r\nNow it catches the gleam of the morning\'s first beam,\r\nIn full glory reflected now shines on the stream;\r\n\'Tis the star-spangled banner; O long may it wave\r\nO\'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!\r\n\r\nAnd where is that band who so vauntingly swore\r\nThat the havoc of war and the battle\'s confusion\r\nA home and a country should leave us no more?\r\nTheir blood has washed out their foul footsteps\' pollution.\r\nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave\r\nFrom the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave;\r\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave\r\nO\'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave.\r\n\r\nO! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand\r\nBetween their loved homes and war\'s desolation!\r\nBlest with victory and peace, may the heav\'n rescued land\r\nPraise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation.\r\nThen conquer we must, when our cause it is just,\r\nAnd this be our motto--"_In God is our trust_:"\r\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave\r\nO\'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *

I will stand at thy right hand, and keep the bridge with thee."\r\nAnd out spake strong Herminius--of Titian blood was he--\r\n"I will abide on thy left side, and keep the bridge with thee."\r\n"Horatius," quoth the consul, "as thou sayest, so let it be."\r\nAnd straight against that great array, forth went the dauntless three.\r\nSoon all Etruria\'s noblest felt their hearts sink to see\r\nOn the earth the bloody corpses, in the path the dauntless three.\r\nAnd from the ghastly entrance, where those bold Romans stood,\r\nThe bravest shrank like boys who rouse an old bear in the wood.\r\nBut meanwhile ax and lever have manfully been plied,\r\nAnd now the bridge hangs tottering above the boiling tide.\r\n"Come back, come back, Horatius!" loud cried the fathers all;\r\n"Back, Lartius! back, Herminius! back, ere the ruin fall!"\r\nBack darted Spurius Lartius; Herminius darted back;\r\nAnd, as they passed, beneath their feet they felt the timbers crack;\r\nBut when they turned their faces, and on the farther shore\r\nSaw brave Horatius stand alone, they would have crossed once more.\r\nBut, with a crash like thunder, fell every loosened beam,\r\nAnd, like a dam, the mighty wreck lay right athwart the stream.\r\nAnd a long shout of triumph rose from the walls of Rome,\r\nAs to the highest turret-tops was splashed the yellow foam.\r\n\r\nAnd, like a horse unbroken, when first he feels the rein,\r\nThe furious river struggled hard, and tossed his tawny mane,\r\nAnd burst the curb, and bounded, rejoicing to be free,\r\nAnd battlement, and plank, and pier whirled headlong to the sea.\r\n\r\nAlone stood brave Horatius, but constant still in mind;\r\nThrice thirty thousand foes before, and the broad flood behind.\r\n"Down with him!" cried false Sextus, with a smile on his pale face.\r\n"Now yield thee!" cried Lars Porsena, "now yield thee to our grace!"\r\n\r\nRound turned he, as not deigning those craven ranks to see;\r\nNought spake he to Lars Porsena, to Sextus nought spake he;\r\nBut he saw on Palatinus the white porch of his home,\r\nAnd he spoke to the noble river that rolls by the towers of Rome:\r\n"O Tiber! Father Tiber! to whom the Romans pray,\r\nA Roman\'s life, a Roman\'s arms, take thou in charge this day!"\r\nSo he spake, and, speaking, sheathed the good sword by his side,\r\nAnd, with his harness on his back, plunged headlong in the tide.\r\n\r\nNo sound of joy or sorrow was heard from either bank;\r\nBut friends and foes, in dumb surprise, stood gazing where he sank,\r\nAnd when above the surges they saw his crest appear,\r\nRome shouted, and e\'en Tuscany could scarce forbear to cheer.\r\n\r\nBut fiercely ran the current, swollen high by months of rain:\r\nAnd fast his blood was flowing; and he was sore in pain,\r\nAnd heavy with his armor, and spent with changing blows:\r\nAnd oft they thought him sinking--but still again he rose.\r\n\r\nNever, I ween, did swimmer, in such an evil case,\r\nStruggle through such a raging flood safe to the landing place:\r\nBut his limbs were borne up bravely by the brave heart within,\r\nAnd our good Father Tiber bare bravely up his chin.\r\n\r\n"Curse on him!" quoth false Sextus; "will not the villain drown?\r\nBut for his stay, ere close of day we should have sacked the town!"\r\n"Heaven help him!" quoth Lars Porsena; "and bring him safe to shore;\r\nFor such a gallant feat of arms was never seen before."\r\n\r\nAnd now he feels the bottom;--now on dry earth he stands;\r\nNow round him throng the fathers to press his gory hands.\r\nAnd now, with shouts and clapping, and noise of weeping loud,\r\nHe enters through the river gate, borne by the joyous crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH YEAR--SECOND HALF\r\n\r\n\r\nALFRED TENNYSON\r\nENGLAND, 1809-1892\r\n\r\nEARLY SPRING\r\n\r\nOnce more the Heavenly Power\r\nMakes all things new,\r\nAnd domes the red-plow\'d hills\r\nWith loving blue;\r\nThe blackbirds have their wills,\r\nThe throstles too.\r\n\r\nOpens a door in Heaven;\r\nFrom skies of glass\r\nA Jacob\'s ladder falls\r\nOn greening grass,\r\nAnd o\'er the mountain-walls\r\nYoung angels pass.\r\n\r\nBefore them fleets the shower,\r\nAnd bursts the buds,\r\nAnd shine the level lands,\r\nAnd flash the floods;\r\nThe stars are from their hands\r\nFlung thro\' the woods.\r\n\r\nThe woods with living airs\r\nHow softly fann\'d,\r\nLight airs from where the deep,\r\nAll down the sand,\r\nIs breathing in his sleep,\r\nHeard by the land.\r\n\r\nO follow, leaping blood,\r\nThe season\'s lure!\r\nO heart, look down and up\r\nSerene, secure.\r\nWarm as the crocus cup,\r\nLike snowdrops, pure!\r\n\r\nPast, Future, glimpse and fade\r\nThro\' some slight spell,\r\nA gleam from yonder vale,\r\nSome far blue fell,\r\nAnd sympathies, how frail,\r\nIn sound and smell.\r\n\r\nTill at thy chuckled note,\r\nThou twinkling bird,\r\nThe fairy fancies range,\r\nAnd, lightly stirr\'d,\r\nRing little bells of change\r\nFrom word to word.\r\n\r\nFor now the Heavenly Power\r\nMakes all things new,\r\nAnd thaws the cold, and fills\r\nThe flower with dew;\r\nThe blackbirds have their wills,\r\nThe poets too.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR GALAHAD\r\n\r\nMy good blade carves the casques of men,\r\nMy tough lance thrusteth sure,\r\nMy strength is as the strength of ten,\r\nBecause my heart is pure.\r\nThe shattering trumpet shrilleth high,\r\nThe hard brands shiver on the steel,\r\nThe splintered spear shafts crack and fly,\r\nThe horse and rider reel;\r\nThey reel, they roll in clanging lists,\r\nAnd when the tide of combat stands,\r\nPerfume and flowers fall in showers,\r\nThat lightly rain from ladies\' hands.\r\n\r\nHow sweet are looks that ladies bend\r\nOn whom their favors fall!\r\nFor them I battle till the end,\r\nTo save from shame and thrall;\r\nBut all my heart is drawn above,\r\nMy knees are bowed in crypt and shrine:\r\nI never felt the kiss of love,\r\nNor maiden\'s hand in mine.\r\nMore bounteous aspects on me beam,\r\nMe mightier transports move and thrill;\r\nSo keep I fair through faith and prayer\r\nA virgin heart in work and will.\r\n\r\nWhen down the stormy crescent goes,\r\nA light before me swims,\r\nBetween dark stems the forest glows,\r\nI hear a noise of hymns:\r\nThen by some secret shrine I ride;\r\nI hear a voice, but none are there;\r\nThe stalls are void, the doors are wide,\r\nThe tapers burning fair.\r\nFair gleams the snowy altar cloth,\r\nThe silver vessels sparkle clean,\r\nThe shrill bell rings, the censer swings,\r\nAnd solemn chants resound between.\r\n\r\nSometimes on lonely mountain meres\r\nI find a magic bark;\r\nI leap on board: no helmsman steers:\r\nI float till all is dark.\r\nA gentle sound, an awful light!\r\nThree angels bear the Holy Grail;\r\nWith folded feet, in stoles of white,\r\nOn sleeping wings they sail.\r\nAh, blessed vision! blood of God!\r\nMy spirit beats her mortal bars,\r\nAs down dark tides the glory slides,\r\nAnd starlike mingles with the stars.\r\n\r\nWhen on my goodly charger borne\r\nThrough dreaming towns I go,\r\nThe cock crows ere the Christmas morn,\r\nThe streets are dumb with snow.\r\nThe tempest crackles on the leads,\r\nAnd, ringing, springs from brand and mail;\r\nBut o\'er the dark a glory spreads,\r\nAnd gilds the driving hail.\r\nI leave the plain, I climb the height;\r\nNo branchy thicket shelter yields;\r\nBut blessed forms in whistling storms\r\nFly o\'er waste fens and windy fields.\r\n\r\nA maiden knight--to me is given\r\nSuch hope, I know not fear;\r\nI yearn to breathe the airs of heaven\r\nThat often meet me here.\r\nI muse on joy that will not cease,\r\nPure spaces clothed in living beams,\r\nPure lilies of eternal peace,\r\nWhose odors haunt my dreams,\r\nAnd, stricken by an angel\'s hand,\r\nThis mortal armor that I wear,\r\nThis weight and size, this heart and eyes,\r\nAre touched, are turned to finest air.\r\n\r\nThe clouds are broken in the sky,\r\nAnd through the mountain walls\r\nA rolling organ-harmony\r\nSwells up, and shakes and falls.\r\nThen move the trees, the copses nod,\r\nWings flutter, voices hover clear:\r\n"O just and faithful knight of God!\r\nRide on! the prize is near."\r\nSo pass I hostel, hall, and grange;\r\nBy bridge and ford, by park and pale,\r\nAll armed I ride, whate\'er betide,\r\nUntil I find the Holy Grail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE\r\n\r\nHalf a league, half a league,\r\nHalf a league onward,\r\nAll in the valley of death\r\nRode the six hundred.\r\n\r\n"Forward, the Light Brigade!\r\nCharge for the guns!" he said;\r\nInto the valley of death\r\nRode the six hundred.\r\n\r\n"Forward, the Light Brigade!"\r\nWas there a man dismayed?\r\nNot though the soldier knew\r\nSome one had blundered;\r\nTheirs not to make reply,\r\nTheirs not to reason why,\r\nTheirs but to do and die:\r\nInto the valley of death\r\nRode the six hundred.\r\n\r\nCannon to right of them,\r\nCannon to left of them,\r\nCannon in front of them\r\nVolleyed and thundered;\r\nStormed at with shot and shell,\r\nBoldly they rode and well,\r\nInto the jaws of death,\r\nInto the mouth of hell\r\nRode the six hundred.\r\n\r\nFlashed all their sabers bare,\r\nFlashed as they turned in air\r\nSabring the gunners there,\r\nCharging an army, while\r\nAll the world wondered.\r\nPlunged in the battery smoke,\r\nRight through the line they broke;\r\nCossack and Russian\r\nReeled from the saber-stroke--\r\nShattered and sundered.\r\nThen they rode back, but not--\r\nNot the six hundred.\r\n\r\nCannon to right of them,\r\nCannon to left of them,\r\nCannon behind them\r\nVolleyed and thundered;\r\nStormed at with shot and shell,\r\nWhile horse and hero fell,\r\nThey that had fought so well\r\nCame through the jaws of death,\r\nBack from the mouth of hell,\r\nAll that was left of them,\r\nLeft of six hundred.\r\n\r\nWhen can their glory fade?\r\nOh, the wild charge they made!\r\nAll the world wondered.\r\nHonor the charge they made,\r\nHonor the Light Brigade,\r\nNoble six hundred!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRING OUT, WILD BELLS\r\n\r\nRing out, wild bells, to the wild sky,\r\nThe flying cloud, the frosty light;\r\nThe year is dying in the night:\r\nRing out, wild bells, and let him die.\r\n\r\nRing out the old, ring in the new,\r\nRing, happy bells, across the snow;\r\nThe year is going, let him go;\r\nRing out the false, ring in the true.\r\n\r\nRing out the grief that saps the mind,\r\nFor those that here we see no more;\r\nRing out the feud of rich and poor,\r\nRing in redress to all mankind.\r\n\r\nRing out a slowly dying cause,\r\nAnd ancient forms of party strife;\r\nRing in the nobler modes of life,\r\nWith sweeter manners, purer laws.\r\n\r\nRing out the want, the care, the sin,\r\nThe faithless coldness of the times;\r\nRing out, ring out my mournful rhymes,\r\nBut ring the fuller minstrel in.\r\n\r\nRing out false pride in place and blood,\r\nThe civic slander and the spite;\r\nRing in the love of truth and right,\r\nRing in the common love of good.\r\n\r\nRing out old shapes of foul disease;\r\nRing out the narrowing lust of gold;\r\nRing out the thousand wars of old,\r\nRing in the thousand years of peace.\r\n\r\nRing in the valiant man and free,\r\nThe larger heart, the kindlier hand;\r\nRing out the darkness of the land,\r\nRing in the Christ that is to be.\r\n\r\n--From "IN MEMORIAM."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALFRED DOMETT\r\nENGLAND, 1811-1887\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS HYMN\r\n\r\nIt was the calm and silent night!\r\nSeven hundred years and fifty-three\r\nHad Rome been growing up to might,\r\nAnd now was queen of land and sea.\r\nNo sound was heard of clashing wars;\r\nPeace brooded o\'er the hushed domain:\r\nApollo, Pallas, Jove, and Mars\r\nHeld undisturbed their ancient reign,\r\nIn the solemn midnight,\r\nCenturies ago.\r\n\r\n\'Twas in the calm and silent night!\r\nThe senator of haughty Rome,\r\nImpatient, urged his chariot\'s flight,\r\nFrom lordly revel rolling home;\r\nTriumphal arches, gleaming, swell.\r\nHis breast with thoughts of boundless sway;\r\nWhat recked the Roman what befell\r\nA paltry province far away,\r\nIn the solemn midnight,\r\nCenturies ago.\r\n\r\nWithin that province far away\r\nWent plodding home a weary boor\r\nA streak of light before him lay,\r\nFallen through a half-shut stable-door\r\nAcross his path.

Your command I obeyed,\r\nRan and raced: like stubble, some field which a fire runs through\r\nWas the space between city and city; two days, two nights did I burn\r\n\r\nOver the hills, under the dales, down pits and up peaks.\r\nInto their midst I broke: breath served but for "Persia has come!\r\nPersia bids Athens proffer slaves\'-tribute, water and earth;\r\nRazed to the ground is Eretria--but Athens, shall Athens sink,\r\nDrop into dust and die--the flower of Hellas utterly die,\r\nDie with the wide world spitting at Sparta, the stupid, the stander-by?\r\nAnswer me quick, what help, what hand do you stretch o\'er\r\ndestruction\'s brink?\r\nHow--when?

Did Sparta respond?\r\nEvery face of her leered in a furrow of envy, mistrust,\r\nMalice,--each eye of her gave me its glitter of gratified hate!\r\nGravely they turned to take counsel, to cast for excuses. I stood\r\nQuivering,--the limbs of me fretting as fire frets, an inch from dry wood:\r\n"Persia has come, Athens asks aid, and still they debate?\r\nThunder, thou Zeus! Athene, are Spartans a quarry beyond\r\nSwing of thy spear? Phoibos and Artemis, clang them \'Ye must\'!"\r\n\r\nNo bolt launched from Olympos! Lo, their answer at last!\r\n"Has Persia come,--does Athens ask aid,--may Sparta befriend?\r\nNowise precipitate judgment--too weighty the issue at stake!\r\nCount we no time lost time which lags thro\' respect to the Gods!\r\nPonder that precept of old, \'No warfare, whatever the odds\r\nIn your favor, so long as the moon, half-orbed, is unable to take\r\nFull-circle her state in the sky!\' Already she rounds to it fast:\r\nAthens must wait, patient as we--who judgment suspend."\r\n\r\nAthens,--except for that sparkle,--thy name, I had moldered to ash!\r\nThat sent a blaze thro\' my blood; off, off and away was I back,\r\n--Not one word to waste, one look to lose on the false and the vile!\r\nYet "O Gods of my land!" I cried, as each hillock and plain,\r\nWood and stream, I knew, I named, rushing past them again,\r\n"Have ye kept faith, proved mindful of honors we paid you erewhile?\r\nVain was the filleted victim, the fulsome libation! Too rash\r\nLove in its choice, paid you so largely service so slack!\r\n\r\n"Oak and olive and bay,--I bid you cease to enwreathe\r\nBrows made bold by your leaf!

Night in the fosse?\r\nAthens to aid? Tho\' the dive were thro\' Erebos, thus I obey--\r\nOut of the day dive, into the day as bravely arise! No bridge\r\nBetter!"--when--ha! what was it I came on, of wonders that are?\r\n\r\nThere, in the cool of a cleft, sat he--majestical Pan!\r\nIvy drooped wanton, kissed his head, moss cushioned his hoof;\r\nAll the great God was good in the eyes grave-kindly--the curl\r\nCarved on the bearded cheek, amused at a mortal\'s awe\r\nAs, under the human trunk, the goat-thighs grand I saw.\r\n"Halt, Pheidippides!"--halt I did, my brain of a whirl:\r\n"Hither to me! Why pale in my presence?" he gracious began:\r\n"How is it,--Athens, only in Hellas, holds me aloof?\r\n\r\n"Athens, she only, rears me no fane, makes me no feast!\r\nWherefore? Than I what godship to Athens more helpful of old?\r\nAye, and still, and forever her friend!

"And then, best runner of Greece,\r\nWhose limbs did duty indeed,--what gift is promised thyself?\r\nTell it us straightway,--Athens the mother demands of her son!"\r\nRosily blushed the youth: he paused: but, lifting at length\r\nHis eyes from the ground, it seemed as he gathered the rest of his strength\r\nInto the utterance--"Pan spoke thus: \'For what thou hast done\r\nCount on a worthy reward! Henceforth be allowed thee release\r\nFrom the racer\'s toil, no vulgar reward in praise or in pelf!\'\r\n\r\n"I am bold to believe, Pan means reward the most to my mind!\r\nFight I shall, with our foremost, wherever this fennel may grow,--\r\nPound--Pan helping us--Persia to dust, and, under the deep,\r\nWhelm her away forever; and then,--no Athens to save,--\r\nMarry a certain maid, I know keeps faith to the brave,--\r\nHie to my house and home: and, when my children shall creep\r\nClose to my knees,--recount how the God was awful yet kind,\r\nPromised their sire reward to the full--rewarding him--so!"\r\n\r\nUnforeseeing one! Yes, he fought on the Marathon day:\r\nSo, when Persia was dust, all cried "To Akropolis!\r\nRun, Pheidippides, one race more! the meed is thy due!\r\n\'Athens is saved, thank Pan,\' go shout!"

they all are in their graves, the gentle race of flowers\r\nAre lying in their lowly beds with the fair and good of ours.\r\nThe rain is falling where they lie, but the cold November rain\r\nCalls not from out the gloomy earth the lovely ones again.\r\nThe windflower and the violet, they perished long ago,\r\nAnd the brier rose and the orchis died amid the summer glow;\r\nBut on the hills the goldenrod, and the aster in the wood,\r\nAnd the yellow sunflower by the brook, in autumn beauty stood,\r\nTill fell the frost from the clear, cold heaven, as falls the plague\r\non men,\r\nAnd the brightness of their smile was gone from upland, glade, and glen.\r\n\r\nAnd now when comes the calm, mild day, as still such days will come,\r\nTo call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home;\r\nWhen the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still,\r\nAnd twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill,\r\nThe south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he bore,\r\nAnd sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more.\r\n\r\nAnd then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died,\r\nThe fair, meek blossom that grew up, and perished by my side.\r\nIn the cold, moist earth we laid her, when the forest cast the leaf,\r\nAnd we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief:\r\nYet not unmeet was it that one like that young friend of ours,\r\nSo gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHANATOPSIS\r\n\r\nTo him who in the love of Nature holds\r\nCommunion with her visible forms, she speaks\r\nA various language; for his gayer hours\r\nShe has a voice of gladness, and a smile\r\nAnd eloquence of beauty, and she glides\r\nInto his darker musings, with a mild\r\nAnd healing sympathy, that steals away\r\nTheir sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts\r\nOf the last bitter hour come like a blight\r\nOver thy spirit, and sad images\r\nOf the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,\r\nAnd breathless darkness, and the narrow house,\r\nMake thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;--\r\nGo forth, under the open sky, and list\r\nTo Nature\'s teachings, while from all around--\r\nEarth and her waters, and the depths of air--\r\nComes a still voice--Yet a few days, and thee\r\nThe all-beholding sun shall see no more\r\nIn all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,\r\nWhere thy pale form was laid, with many tears,\r\nNor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist\r\nThy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim\r\nThy growth, to be resolved to earth again,\r\nAnd, lost each human trace, surrendering up\r\nThine individual being, shalt thou go\r\nTo mix for ever with the elements,\r\nTo be a brother to the insensible rock\r\nAnd to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain\r\nTurns with his share, and treads upon. The oak\r\nShall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold.\r\n\r\nYet not to thine eternal resting-place\r\nShalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish\r\nCouch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down\r\nWith patriarchs of the infant world--with kings,\r\nThe powerful of the earth--the wise, the good,\r\nFair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,\r\nAll in one mighty sepulchre. The hills\r\nRock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,--the vales\r\nStretching in pensive quietness between;\r\nThe venerable woods--rivers that move\r\nIn majesty, and the complaining brooks\r\nThat make the meadows green; and, poured round all,\r\nOld ocean\'s gray and melancholy waste,--\r\nAre but the solemn decorations all\r\nOf the great tomb of man. The golden sun,\r\nThe planets, all the infinite host of heaven,\r\nAre shining on the sad abodes of death,\r\nThrough the still lapse of ages. All that tread\r\nThe globe are but a handful to the tribes\r\nThat slumber in its bosom.--Take the wings\r\nOf morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,\r\nOr lose thyself in the continuous woods\r\nWhere rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,\r\nSave his own dashings--yet the dead are there:\r\nAnd millions in those solitudes, since first\r\nThe flight of years began, have laid them down\r\nIn their last sleep--the dead reign there alone.\r\nSo shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw\r\nIn silence from the living, and no friend\r\nTake note of thy departure? All that breathe\r\nWill share thy destiny. The gay will laugh\r\nWhen thou art gone, the solemn brood of care\r\nPlod on, and each one as before will chase\r\nHis favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave\r\nTheir mirth and their employments, and shall come\r\nAnd make their bed with thee. As the long train\r\nOf ages glides away, the sons of men,\r\nThe youth in life\'s fresh spring, and he who goes\r\nIn the full strength of years, matron, and maid,\r\nThe speechless babe, and the gray-headed man,--\r\nShall one by one be gathered to thy side,\r\nBy those, who in their turn shall follow them.\r\n\r\nSo live, that when thy summons comes to join\r\nThe innumerable caravan, which moves\r\nTo that mysterious realm, where each shall take\r\nHis chamber in the silent halls of death,\r\nThou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,\r\nScourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed\r\nBy an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,\r\nLike one who wraps the drapery of his couch\r\nAbout him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRALPH WALDO EMERSON\r\nAMERICA, 1803-1882\r\n\r\n\'Twas one of the charm\xc3\xa9d days\r\nWhen the genius of God doth flow,\r\nThe wind may alter twenty ways,\r\nA tempest cannot blow;\r\nIt may blow north, it still is warm;\r\nOr south, it still is clear;\r\nOr east, it smells like a clover-farm;\r\nOr west, no thunder fear.\r\nThe musing peasant lowly great\r\nBeside the forest water sate;\r\nThe rope-like pine roots crosswise grown\r\nCompose the network of his throne;\r\nThe wide lake, edged with sand and grass,\r\nWas burnished to a floor of glass,\r\nPainted with green and proud\r\nOf the tree and of the cloud.\r\nHe was the heart of all the scene;\r\nOn him the sun looked more serene;\r\nTo hill and cloud his face was known,--\r\nIt seemed the likeness of their own;\r\nThey knew by secret sympathy\r\nThe public child of earth and sky.\r\n"You ask," he said, "what guide\r\nMe through trackless thickets led,\r\nThrough thick-stemmed woodlands rough and wide.\r\nI found the water\'s bed.\r\nThe watercourses were my guide;\r\nI traveled grateful by their side,\r\nOr through their channel dry;\r\nThey led me through the thicket damp,\r\nThrough brake and fern, the beaver\'s camp,\r\nThrough beds of granite cut my road,\r\nAnd their resistless friendship showed:\r\nThe falling waters led me,\r\nThe foodful waters fed me,\r\nAnd brought me to the lowest land,\r\nUnerring to the ocean sand.\r\nThe moss upon the forest bark\r\nWas pole-star when the night was dark;\r\nThe purple berries in the wood\r\nSupplied me necessary food;\r\nFor Nature ever faithful is\r\nTo such as trust her faithfulness.\r\nWhen the forest shall mislead me,\r\nWhen the night and morning lie,\r\nWhen sea and land refuse to feed me,\r\n\'Twill be time enough to die;\r\nThen will yet my mother yield\r\nA pillow in her greenest field,\r\nNor the June flowers scorn to cover\r\nThe clay of their departed lover."\r\n\r\n--From "WOODNOTES."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW\r\nAMERICA, 1807-1882\r\n\r\nDAYBREAK\r\n\r\nA wind came up out of the sea,\r\nAnd said, "O mists, make room for me."\r\n\r\nIt hailed the ships, and cried, "Sail on,\r\nYe mariners, the night is gone."\r\n\r\nAnd hurried landward far away,\r\nCrying, "Awake!

And then a speck--\r\nA light! a light! a light! a light!\r\nIt grew, a starlit flag unfurled!\r\nIt grew to be Time\'s burst of dawn.\r\nHe gained a world; he gave that world\r\nIts greatest lesson: "On! sail on!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN VANCE CHENEY\r\nAMERICA, 1848-\r\n\r\nEVENING SONGS[1]\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe birds have hid, the winds are low,\r\nThe brake is awake, the grass aglow:\r\nThe bat is the rover,\r\nNo bee on the clover,\r\nThe day is over,\r\nAnd evening come.\r\n\r\nThe heavy beetle spreads her wings,\r\nThe toad has the road, the cricket sings:\r\nThe bat is the rover,\r\nNo bee on the clover,\r\nThe day is over,\r\nAnd evening come.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIt is that pale, delaying hour\r\nWhen nature closes like a flower,\r\nAnd on the spirit lies,\r\nThe silence of the earth and skies.\r\nThe world has thoughts she will not own\r\nWhen shade and dream with night have flown;\r\nBright overhead, a star\r\nMakes golden guesses what they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNow is Light, sweet mother, down the west,\r\nWith little Song against her breast;\r\nShe took him up, all tired with play,\r\nAnd fondly bore him far away.\r\n\r\nWhile he sleeps, one wanders in his stead,\r\nA fainter glory round her head;\r\nShe follows happy waters after,\r\nLeaving behind low, rippling laughter.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBehind the hilltop drops the sun,\r\nThe curled heat falters on the sand,\r\nWhile evening\'s ushers, one by one,\r\nLead in the guests of Twilight Land.\r\n\r\nThe bird is silent overhead,\r\nBelow the beast has laid him down;\r\nAfar, the marbles watch the dead,\r\nThe lonely steeple guards the town.\r\n\r\nThe south wind feels its amorous course\r\nTo cloistered sweet in thickets found;\r\nThe leaves obey its tender force,\r\nAnd stir \'twixt silence and a sound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n[Footnote 1: From "Poems," published by Messrs.

If\r\nspring came but once a century, instead of once a\r\nyear, or burst forth with a sound of an earthquake\r\nand not in silence, what wonder and expectation\r\nwould there be in all hearts to behold the miraculous\r\nchange!\r\n\r\nBut now the silent succession suggests nothing\r\nbut necessity. To most men, only the cessation of\r\nthe miracle would be miraculous, and the perpetual\r\nexercise of God\'s power seems less wonderful than\r\nits withdrawal would be. We are like children who\r\nare astonished and delighted only by the second-hand\r\nof the clock, not by the hour-hand.\r\n\r\nIn the fields and woods, meanwhile, there were\r\nother signs and signals of the summer. The darkening\r\nfoliage; the embrowning grain; the golden dragonfly\r\nhaunting the blackberry bushes; the cawing\r\ncrows, that looked down from the mountain on the\r\ncornfield, and waited day after day for the scarecrow\r\nto finish his work and depart; and the smoke of far-off\r\nburning woods, that pervaded the air and hung\r\nin purple haze about the summits of the mountains,\r\n--these were the vaunt-couriers and attendants of\r\nthe hot August.\r\n\r\nThe brown autumn came. Out of doors, it brought\r\nto the fields the prodigality of the golden harvest,--\r\nto the forest, revelations of light,--and to the sky,\r\nthe sharp air, the morning mist, the red clouds at\r\nevening. Within doors, the sense of seclusion, the\r\nstillness of closed and curtained windows, musings by\r\nthe fireside, books, friends, conversation, and the long,\r\nmeditative evenings. To the farmer, it brought surcease\r\nof toil,--to the scholar, that sweet delirium of\r\nthe brain which changes toil to pleasure. It brought\r\nthe wild duck back to the reedy marshes of the south;\r\nit brought the wild song back to the fervid brain of the\r\npoet. Without, the village street was paved with gold;\r\nthe river ran red with the reflection of the leaves.\r\nWithin, the faces of friends brightened the gloomy\r\nwalls; the returning footsteps of the long-absent\r\ngladdened the threshold; and all the sweet amenities\r\nof social life again resumed their interrupted reign.\r\n\r\nThe first snow came. How beautiful it was, falling\r\nso silently, all day long, all night long, on the\r\nmountains, on the meadows, on the roofs of the\r\nliving, on the graves of the dead! All white save\r\nthe river, that marked its course by a winding black\r\nline across the landscape; and the leafless trees, that\r\nagainst the leaden sky now revealed more fully the\r\nwonderful beauty and intricacy of their branches!\r\n\r\nWhat silence, too, came with the snow, and what\r\nseclusion! Every sound was muffled, every noise\r\nchanged to something soft and musical. No more\r\ntrampling hoofs,--no more rattling wheels! Only\r\nthe chiming sleigh bells, beating as swift and merrily\r\nas the hearts of children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX: BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH AUTHORS\r\n\r\nGEOFFREY CHAUCER, the father of English poetry, was born in\r\nLondon in 1340. The colleges of Oxford and Cambridge both claim him\r\nas a student. He enjoyed the favor of King Edward the Third, and\r\npassed much of his time at court. In 1386 he was made a knight, and\r\nduring the latter part of his life he received an annual pension.\r\nHe died in 1400. His writings are in a language so different from\r\nmodern English that many persons cannot enjoy their beauties. His\r\nprincipal poems are "Canterbury Tales," "The Legend of Good Women,"\r\n"The Court of Love," and "Troilus and Cressida."\r\n\r\nEDMUND SPENSER was born in London about 1553. He was\r\ngraduated at Cambridge in 1576, and soon after wrote "The Shepherd\'s\r\nCalendar." Sir Philip Sidney and Sir Walter Raleigh were his friends\r\nand patrons. In 1598 Spenser was appointed a sheriff in Ireland, and\r\nnot long afterward in a rebellion his property was destroyed and his\r\nchild killed. He did not long survive this calamity. His best-known\r\npoem is "The Faery Queen."\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF QUEEN ELIZABETH is often called the Golden Age of\r\nEnglish literature. Not only did Spenser and Shakespeare live then,\r\nbut a large number of minor poets also rendered the period\r\nillustrious. Among the dramatic poets Christopher Marlowe, Beaumont\r\nand Fletcher, who wrote together, and Ben Jonson hold an honorable\r\nposition. The most noted lyric poets of the day were George Herbert,\r\nSir Walter Raleigh, and Sir Philip Sidney. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,\r\nthe greatest of English poets, was born at Stratford-on-Avon in\r\nApril, 1564. He is supposed to have been educated at the free school\r\nof Stratford. When he was about twenty-two, he went to London, and\r\nafter a hard struggle with poverty, he became first an actor, then a\r\nsuccessful playwright and theater manager. Having gained not only\r\nfame but a modest fortune, he retired in 1611 to live at ease in\r\nStratford until his death in 1616. Besides the two long poems,\r\n"Venus and Adonis" and "Lucrece," which first won popularity for\r\nhim, he has written thirty-seven plays, ranging from the lightest\r\ncomedy, through romance and historical narrative, to the darkest\r\ntragedy. Whatever form his verse takes,--sonnet, song, or dramatic\r\npoetry,--it shows the touch of the master hand, the inspiration of\r\nthe master mind. Of his plays those which are still most frequently\r\nacted are the tragedies "Hamlet," "Macbeth," "King Lear," and\r\n"Othello," the comedies "Midsummer-night\'s Dream," "The Merchant of\r\nVenice," "As You Like It," and "The Comedy of Errors," and the\r\nhistorical plays "Julius Caesar," "King Henry IV," "King Henry V,"\r\nand "Richard III."\r\n\r\nBEN JONSON was born at Westminster, England, about 1573. He\r\nwas the friend of Shakespeare and a famous dramatist in his day, but\r\nhis plays no longer hold the stage. His best play is "Every Man in\r\nhis Humour." His songs and short poems are beautiful. He died in\r\n1637. His tomb in Westminster Abbey is inscribed "O Rare Ben Jonson!"\r\n\r\nGEORGE HERBERT was born in Montgomery Castle, Wales, April 3,\r\n1593. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge.

He was\r\neducated at Christ\'s College, Cambridge. Later he spent a year in\r\ntravel, meeting the great Galileo while in Italy. He was an ardent\r\nadvocate of freedom, and under the Protectorate he was the secretary\r\nof the Protector, Oliver Cromwell. When only forty-six, he became\r\ntotally blind, yet his greatest work was done after this misfortune\r\novertook him. As a poet he stands second only to Shakespeare. His\r\nearly poems, "Comus," "L\'Allegro," "Il Penseroso," and "Lycidas,"\r\nare very beautiful, and his "Paradise Lost" is the finest epic poem\r\nin the English language. He died in 1674.\r\n\r\nTHE MINOR POETS of the age of Milton were Edmund Waller,\r\nRobert Herrick, George Wither, Sir John Suckling, and Sir Richard\r\nLovelace.\r\n\r\nJOHN DRYDEN was born August 9, 1631. He was educated at\r\nTrinity College, Cambridge. His poem in honor of the restoration\r\nof Charles II won him the position of Poet Laureate.

He died in 1700.\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF QUEEN ANNE was rendered brilliant by the writings\r\nof Alexander Pope, Joseph Addison, Edward Young, James Thompson,\r\nWilliam Collins, Sir Richard Steele, Jonathan Swift, and Daniel\r\nDefoe. Not only were the poems of this period beautiful, but prose\r\nalso reached a high development.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ADDISON was born at Milston, England, May 1, 1672. He\r\ncompleted his education at Queen\'s and Magdalen colleges, Oxford.  He\r\nentered the diplomatic service and rose steadily, becoming one of the\r\ntwo principal secretaries of state two years before his death.  He\r\nattained a higher political position than any other writer has ever\r\nachieved through his literary ability. With Steele he published\r\n_The Tatler_, and later _The Spectator_, at first a daily paper and\r\nafterward a tri-weekly one. He was a master of English prose, and his\r\npoems are elevated and serious in style. He died in 1719.\r\n\r\nISAAC WATTS was born at Southampton, July 17, 1674. He studied\r\nfor the ministry. He wrote nearly five hundred hymns besides his\r\n"Divine and Moral Songs for Children." Many of his hymns are still\r\nfavorites.

He was\r\nvery delicate and afflicted with nervousness that amounted to\r\ninsanity at times. Not until 1780 did he seriously begin his literary\r\ncareer. Then for a period of a little more than ten years he worked\r\nwith success and was happy. His most famous poems are "John Gilpin,"\r\n"The Task," "Hope," and "Lines on my Mother\'s Portrait." In the\r\nlatter part of his life his nervous melancholy again affected him.\r\nHe died in 1800.\r\n\r\nROBERT BURNS was born at Ayr in Scotland, January 25, 1759.\r\nHe was the son of a poor farmer, and he himself followed the plow\r\nin his earlier days.

His finest poems are "The Earthly\r\nParadise," a series of Norse legends, "Three Northern Stones,"\r\ntranslated from Icelandic poems, and his translations of "The\r\nOdyssey." He died in 1896.\r\n\r\nALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE was born in London, April 5, 1837.\r\nHe was educated partly in France, at Eton, and at Balliol College,\r\nOxford. He left the University without a degree to spend several\r\nyears in travel. He is a master of English, using a wider vocabulary\r\nthan any of his contemporaries, and the musical effects of his many\r\nvaried meters have won for him a unique position in poetry.  He has\r\nbeen called "the greatest metrical inventor in English literature."\r\nHis works in French and Latin show him to be a poet in three\r\nlanguages. His best-known works are "Poems and Ballads," "Songs\r\nbefore Sunrise," and "Mary Stuart." He is the greatest living\r\nEnglish poet.\r\n\r\nDANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI was born in London, May 12, 1828. He\r\nstudied art in the antique school of the Royal Academy, and became\r\nknown as an artist before he won fame as a poet. His most widely\r\nknown poem is "The Blessed Damozel." He died in 1882.\r\n\r\nCHRISTINA GEORGINA ROSSETTI, the sister of D.G. Rossetti, was\r\nborn in London, December 5, 1830. She ranks as one of the greatest\r\nand most spiritual of English poetesses.\r\n\r\nSIR EDWIN ARNOLD was born in Sussex, June 10, 1832. He was\r\neducated at King\'s College, London, and at University College,\r\nOxford. He was appointed principal of the Government Sanscrit\r\nCollege at Poonah, India, and Fellow of the University of Bombay, and\r\nheld these posts through the Sepoy Rebellion. Returning to London in\r\n1861, he was one of the editors of the _Daily Telegraph_, and\r\nthrough his influence Henry M. Stanley undertook his first expedition\r\ninto Africa to find Livingstone. Nearly all of his poetry deals with\r\nOriental legends, and much of his time was spent in India and Japan.\r\nHis principal works are "The Light of Asia," "Pearls of the Faith,"\r\n"Indian Song of Songs," "Japonica," and "The Light of the World."\r\n\r\nRUDYARD KIPLING was born in Bombay, India, December 30, 1865.\r\nHe was educated partly in England, but returned to India when he was\r\nonly fifteen, and there began his literary work and first won fame.\r\nHis writings are mainly in prose, and he is at his best when writing\r\nof India. His poems are all short, and "The Recessional" and "The\r\nDove of Dacca" are especially fine. In prose the "Jungle Books,"\r\n"The Naulakha," and "Kim" are the most popular.\r\n\r\nAMONG THE MINOR POETS of the Victorian Age may be mentioned\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\nJohn Henry, Cardinal Newman, 1801-1890. Author of many volumes of\r\nsermons and the hymn "Lead Kindly Light."\r\n\r\nHenry Francis Lyte, 1763-1847. Author of many hymns, the most\r\npopular of which is "Abide with Me."\r\n\r\nAlfred Domett, 1811-1887. Author of "Christmas Hymn."\r\n\r\nArthur Hugh Clough, 1810-1861. Author of "Bothie of Tober-na-vuolich."\r\n\r\nCharles Mackay, 1814-1889. Author of many songs, among them "There is\r\na Good Time Coming" and "Cheer, Boys, Cheer!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN AUTHORS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early days of this country the time and thought of the\r\nsettlers were taken up in struggling with the difficulties of their\r\nsurroundings, so that there was little opportunity for the\r\nestablishment of an American literature. For art, poetry, and the\r\nbeautiful in life, the colonists naturally turned to the mother\r\ncountry--to the home which they had so lately left. During the period\r\nbefore the French and Indian War the subject of religion and nice\r\npoints of doctrine filled the minds of the Americans, hence we find\r\nthat the first American writer who attained to a European reputation\r\nwas the Rev. Jonathan Edwards, a distinguished divine and president\r\nof Princeton College. His books on "The Religious Affections" and\r\n"The Freedom of the Will" are still studied.\r\n\r\nAfter the French and Indian War, politics became the absorbing topic\r\nof the day, and Benjamin Franklin was the first to achieve fame in\r\nthis field of letters. His writings in "Poor Richard\'s Almanac,"\r\nhonest and wholesome in tone, exercised a marked influence upon the\r\nliterature of his time. Among the orators who won distinction in the\r\ndiscussion of civil liberty are James Otis, John and Samuel Adams,\r\nand Patrick Henry. The writings of John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and\r\nJames Madison in _The Federalist_ secured the adoption of the\r\nConstitution and survive to this day as brilliant examples of\r\npolitical essays, while the state papers of George Washington and\r\nThomas Jefferson are models of clearness and elegance of style.\r\n\r\nWith the peace and prosperity that followed the establishment of our\r\nrepublic came the opportunity to cultivate the broader fields of\r\nliterature. Relieved of the strain of the struggle for civil and\r\nreligious liberty, the people could satisfy their inclinations toward\r\nthe beautiful in art and life, and from that time until the present\r\nday the writers of America have held their own in the front ranks\r\nof the authors of the English-speaking peoples.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE, the first American poet to win\r\ndistinction, was born in New York City in 1795. He was educated in\r\nColumbia College. He died prematurely when only twenty-five years old.\r\nHis best-known poems are "The Culprit Fay" and "The American Flag."\r\nHe was the intimate friend of Fitz-Greene Halleck, the Connecticut\r\npoet, author of "Marco Bozzaris." The last four lines of Drake\'s\r\n"American Flag" were written by Fitz-Greene Halleck.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT was born in Cummington, Massachusetts,\r\nNovember 3, 1794. He was educated at Williams College. He studied\r\nlaw and was admitted to the bar. His first poem was published when\r\nhe was thirteen. His best-known poem, "Thanatopsis," was written\r\nwhen he was only nineteen and delivered at his college commencement.\r\nAfter practicing law for a short time, he became editor of _The\r\nEvening Post_ and continued this work until his death. When he was\r\nseventy-two, he began his translation of Homer, which occupied him\r\nfor six years. He died in 1878.\r\n\r\nRALPH WALDO EMERSON was born in Boston, May 20, 1803. He\r\nstudied at Harvard College, and after a period of teaching, became\r\npastor of a Unitarian church in Boston for a short time. Later he\r\nsettled in Concord, spending his time in writing and lecturing in\r\nthis country and England. He was the founder of what has been called\r\n"The Concord School of Philosophy." His best-known poems are "The\r\nConcord Hymn," "Rhodora," "The Snow Storm," "Each and All," "The\r\nDays," and "The Humble Bee." He died in 1882.\r\n\r\nHENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW was born in Portland, Maine,\r\nFebruary 27, 1807. He was educated at Bowdoin College and, after a\r\nperiod of study abroad, was appointed professor of Foreign Languages\r\nthere. This position he gave up to become professor of Modern\r\nLanguages and Literature at Harvard College. At Cambridge he was a\r\nfriend of Hawthorne, Holmes, Emerson, Lowell, and Alcott. His\r\nbest-known long poems are "Evangeline," "Hiawatha," "The Building\r\nof the Ship," and "The Courtship of Miles Standish." He made a fine\r\ntranslation of Dante\'s "Divine Comedy." Among his many short poems,\r\n"Excelsior," "The Psalm of Life," "The Wreck of the Hesperus," "The\r\nVillage Blacksmith," and "Paul Revere\'s Ride" are continuously\r\npopular.  He died in 1882. He was the first American writer who was\r\nhonored by a memorial in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nJOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER was born near Haverhill, Massachusetts,\r\nDecember 17, 1807. He was educated in the public school, working at\r\nthe same time on his father\'s farm or at making shoes. Having left\r\nthe academy, he devoted himself to literature. He was an ardent\r\nabolitionist, and many of his poems are written to aid the cause of\r\nfreedom in which he was so deeply interested. His best-known poems\r\nare "Snow-Bound," "Barbara Frietchie," "Maude Muller," and "Voices of\r\nFreedom." He died in 1892.\r\n\r\nEDGAR ALLAN POE was born in Boston, Massachusetts, January 19,\r\n1809. The story of his life is as melancholy as was his genius.\r\nWild, dissipated, reckless, he was dismissed from West Point. He\r\nalienated his best friends and lived the greatest part of his life in\r\nthe deepest poverty, dying in 1849 from the effects of dissipation\r\nand exposure. His best poems are "The Raven," "The Bells," and\r\n"Annabel Lee."\r\n\r\nOLIVER WENDELL HOLMES was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts,\r\nAugust 29, 1809. He was educated at Harvard College and studied\r\nmedicine, spending two years in the hospitals of Europe. He was\r\nsuccessively professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Dartmouth\r\nCollege, a physician in regular practice in Boston, and professor of\r\nanatomy at Harvard College--this position he held from 1847 to 1882.\r\nHe was nearly fifty before he became widely known as a writer, when\r\n"The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table" was published. He was successful\r\nas essayist, novelist, poet, a kindly wit playing through much of his\r\nwork. His best-known poems are "Old Ironsides," "The Chambered\r\nNautilus," "The One-hoss Shay," "The Last Leaf," and "The Boys." He\r\ndied in 1894.\r\n\r\nJAMES RUSSELL LOWELL was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts,\r\nFebruary 22, 1819. He was educated at Harvard College.

He served in various occupations,\r\nteacher, printer, writer, until in the great Civil War he volunteered\r\nas a war nurse. His exertions and exposure in this work destroyed his\r\nhealth, so that most of his remaining years he was dependent upon his\r\nfriends. His most beautiful poem is "O Captain, My Captain," written\r\nafter the assassination of Lincoln.  He died in 1892.\r\n\r\nCINCINNATUS HEINE MILLER, who wrote under the name of Joaquin\r\nMiller, was born in Indiana in 1841. While yet a boy he went to Oregon\r\nand later to California, where he led a wild life among the miners,\r\nfighting the Indians, practicing law, and becoming a county judge.\r\nAfter several years in Europe and New York, he settled down as a\r\nfruit grower in California. He wrote "Songs of the Sierras," "Songs\r\nof the Sun-Lands," and "The Ship in the Desert."\r\n\r\nAMONG THE MINOR AMERICAN POETS the following are worthy of\r\nnote:--\r\n\r\nFrancis Scott Key, 1779-1843.

In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
