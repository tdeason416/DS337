It is a\r\nmistake to attribute noble or mean qualities to animals or birds, or to\r\nthink they can do good or bad actions, when they can only do what God\r\nhas created them to do, and as their instinct teaches.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful of the eagles is the Golden Eagle, so called because\r\nof the rich yellowish-brown bordering to its feathers. It makes its nest\r\nin the clefts of the rocky sides of the mountains, and seldom on a tree,\r\nunless where one has sprung up in between the clefts, and the tangled\r\nroots make a sort of platform. This the eagles cover with sticks, and\r\nhere they make their house, living in it always, and not only when they\r\nlay eggs or have young ones.\r\n\r\nIf there are eaglets in the nest, the food is at once carried home to\r\nthem, and the skinning and eating done at home. Eagles are very\r\nattentive to their young, and feed them with great care until they are\r\nable to take care of themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZEBRA AND YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Zebra, standing with her baby by her side, asks proudly of the\r\nlookers-on, "Did you ever see such a likeness?" and certainly mother and\r\nchild are very much alike, striped all over their bodies, from head to\r\nfoot, and from nose to tail, with the same regular marks of black.\r\nStrong and wild by nature, the zebra family are left very much to\r\nthemselves, which is a source of great happiness to the mother and child\r\nin the picture before us. "No! no! my baby is not going to become as\r\ntame as the donkey, or to draw carts and carriages like the horse; it is\r\nto have its freedom, and go just where it likes all over these large\r\nplains;"--so says Mrs. Zebra, and she means it too, for if anybody took\r\nthe trouble to go all the way to the hot country of Africa, where Mrs.\r\nZebra is at home, and tried to carry off her baby, they would find their\r\njourney a vain one, and that she would kick severely, and perhaps break\r\nthe legs of the person bold enough to take away her darling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. BRUIN AND FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the American black bear, who is looking so lively and seemingly\r\ninviting the young folks to have a romp, which they will be only too\r\nwilling to join in. The black bear is of a timid disposition, and seldom\r\nattacks man except in self-defense. The female bear is a most\r\naffectionate mother, and many stories are related showing her care and\r\nlove for her young, and her sorrow and mournful cries when any evil\r\nbefalls them. On one occasion a black bear with her two cubs was pursued\r\nacross the ice by some armed sailors. At first she urged her cubs to\r\nincreased speed, but finding her pursuers gaining upon them, she\r\ncarried, pushed, and pitched them, alternately, forward, until she\r\neffected their escape from her pursuers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE OWLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho has not at one time or other of his life read fairy tales and\r\nsympathized with stories of enchanted princes and princesses? I once\r\nthought of this when a country boy offered me a nest with four of the\r\nyoung of the Little Owl. I put them into a large cage, where they could\r\nstare at each other and at my pigeons to their hearts\' content.\r\n\r\nLet me say that this little owl is a very useful bird, for it keeps\r\nmice, bats, beetles, and other creatures in check, which might otherwise\r\nmultiply too fast. On a spring or summer evening you may hear its\r\nplaintive hoot among the apple-blossoms of an orchard, or the sheaves of\r\na cornfield. Curiously enough, this simple sound earned the little bird\r\nthe name of being the harbinger of death, and peasants believed that\r\nwhenever its cry was heard where sickness was in the family, the patient\r\nwas sure to die.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUROCHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Aurochs in blind rage, charging through thick and thin, has had a\r\nfascination for me as long as I can remember. The true aurochs and this,\r\nthe European Bison, ceased to exist in the British Isles, except in the\r\nZoological Gardens; but the latter is still found wild in Lithuania, and\r\nis also carefully preserved in other parts of Russia, of which the\r\nEmperor has a herd. There is much talk about their being untamable--that\r\nthey will not mix with tame cattle--that tame cows shrink from the\r\naurochs\' calves; but does not any cow shrink from any calf not her own?\r\nThe American Bison, with which you are all pretty familiar, is very\r\nsimilar to the one just mentioned. There have been several attempts made\r\nto domesticate the American bison, and have been so far successful. The\r\nsize and strength of the animal make it probable that if domesticated,\r\nit would be of great use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KANGAROO.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Well," said little Herbert Joyce, as he looked over the books of\r\ndrawings which his cousin had just brought home from Australia, "I never\r\nsaw anything so extraordinary before in all my life; why here is an\r\nanimal with three heads, and two of them are very low down, and much\r\nsmaller than the others." "What do you mean, Herbert?" asked his cousin,\r\nwho just then came into the room. "There are no three-headed\r\nanimals--let me see the picture. Oh! no wonder you were puzzled; it does\r\nlook like a queer creature. That is a kangaroo, and the small heads\r\nbelong to her children, whom she carries about in a bag formed by a hole\r\nin her skin, until they are old enough to walk; and the little things\r\nseem very happy there; and sometimes, as their mother moves along over\r\nthe grass, you may see them nibbling it."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEACOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nProud bird! I watched thee stalking by,\r\n  With stately step and slow,\r\nAs though thou fain would\'st charm each eye\r\n  With glittering pomp and show:\r\n\r\nAnd truly thou art brave to see,\r\n  In heaven\'s hues arrayed,\r\nAnd plainer birds at sight of thee\r\n  Might shrink and be dismayed:\r\n\r\nYet, pampered bird! there still are those\r\n  I value higher far,\r\nAlbeit their garb nor glints nor glows\r\n  With many a jeweled star.\r\n\r\nI love them for their gentle ways,\r\n  Their voices soft and sweet\r\nIn summer chorus, that repays\r\n  Right well their winter\'s meat.\r\n\r\nFor what is outward form at best\r\n  But accident of birth?\r\nThat form in splendid raiment drest\r\n  Is still but common earth.\r\n\r\nAnd yet \'tis he whose painted plumes\r\n  Shine fairest in the sun,\r\nWho haughtiest look of pride assumes,\r\n  As though by him \'twere done.\r\n\r\nWe smile to see yon bird strut by,\r\n  Thus proud of his array;\r\nBut human friends we may espy\r\n  As foolish every day.\r\n\r\nNot beauty\'s form nor grand attire\r\n  Upon the wise will tell,\r\nBut _acts_ of those who e\'er aspire\r\n  To do their DUTY well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEEDING THE PET.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis beautiful and majestic bird was considered the bird-royal in\r\nEngland, owing to a law of England that when found in a partially wild\r\nstate on the sea and navigable rivers it belonged to the crown; but of\r\ncourse it is to be found on the ponds and lakes of many a gentleman\'s\r\nestate, and is always prized as a great ornament to the lake. The swan\r\nis also very valuable in clearing the ponds of weeds, and makes a most\r\neffective clearance, as they eat them before they rise to the surface.\r\nThe swan affords a pleasing illustration of the love of the mother-bird\r\nfor its young, and has been known to vanquish a fox who made an attack\r\non its nest--showing that the instinct of motherhood kindles boldness\r\nand bravery in the breast of the most timid animals. The nest is\r\ngenerally made on an islet, and composed of reeds and rushes, and when\r\nthe five or seven large eggs are hatched, the mother may be seen\r\nswimming about with the young ones on her back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA LION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough such large and powerful creatures, these sea lions are innocent\r\nand playful. See, one of them has reared himself up on his hind legs, if\r\nlegs they may be called, and is sitting on a chair with his flappers\r\nover the back of the chair. It inhabits the eastern shores of\r\nKamtchatka, and is in some places extremely abundant, and measuring\r\nabout fifteen feet in length. It is much addicted to roaring, which, as\r\nmuch as the mane of the old males, has obtained for it the name of the\r\nSea Lion. The old males have a fierce appearance, yet they fly in great\r\nhaste on the approach of man, but if driven to extremities they will\r\nfight desperately; but in captivity they are capable of being tamed, and\r\nbecome very familiar with man. The scientific name of the sea lion is\r\nOtary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LION.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA--THE ASS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Forbear to vex the patient Ass,\r\nIts heaving sides to goad,\r\nAnd far and safe its useful back\r\nWill carry many a load._\r\n\r\n\r\nB--THE BITTERN.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In reedy swamp and lonely marsh,\r\nWhere all is shade and gloom,\r\nThe Bittern stalks, and you may hear\r\nHis voice in sullen boom._\r\n\r\n\r\nC--THE CAMEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Camel is a useful beast,\r\nPatient, and slow, and mild;\r\nTo man a blessing and a boon\r\nIn Afric\'s sandy wild._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBADGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day at the Zoological Gardens, I saw the group of Badgers as they\r\nare here given. Little do visitors to the gardens take into account how\r\nmuch a wild animal goes through till it has got used to a state of\r\nthings so opposite to its natural habits. Their wants are attended to as\r\nmuch as possible, but cannot be always met; and so we have here a\r\ndevoted mother, worn out by the demands of her cubs, and vainly anxious\r\nto hide herself from daylight and man\'s gaze. She has long given up\r\ntrying to dig or scratch her way out. All she can do is to lean against\r\nthe wall, ready for a last defence, should anybody come within her\r\nprison. She dares not curl up into a ball, like the one cub, and go to\r\nsleep; while this little careless imp on her back, happy and trustful,\r\nadds to her tiredness by his weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIRD\'S NEST.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Her little nest, so soft and warm,\r\n  God teaches her to make it;\r\nI would not dare to do her harm,\r\n  I would not dare to take it."\r\n\r\nHow curious is the structure of the nest of the Bullfinch or Chaffinch!\r\nThe inside of it is lined with cotton and fine silken threads; and the\r\noutside cannot be sufficiently admired, though it is composed only of\r\nvarious kinds of fine moss. The color of these mosses, resembling that\r\nof the bark of the tree in which the nest is built, proves that the bird\r\nintended it should not be easily discovered. In some nests, hair, wool,\r\nand rushes are cleverly interwoven. In others, the parts are firmly\r\nfastened by a thread, which the bird makes of hemp, wool, hair, or, more\r\ncommonly, of spiders\' webs. Other birds--as, for instance, the blackbird\r\nand the lapwing--after they have constructed their nests, plaster the\r\ninside with mortar; they then stick upon it, while quite wet, some wool\r\nor moss to give warmth; but all alike construct their nests so as to add\r\nto their security.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHAMOIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chamois are indeed high-born, for among the high mountain-peaks,\r\nwhere the eternal snow rests and the Alpine roses bloom, there they make\r\ntheir home! There they spring up over the snowy slopes to those heights\r\nto which man cannot climb. They rest upon the glittering ice, the snow\r\ndoes not blind them, neither does it cool their hot blood. Carelessly\r\nthey stride across the snowed-over crevices, and when the terrible\r\nstorms, at which men are so alarmed, hurl down rocks and avalanches from\r\nthe summits, the Chamois do not fear them. They find their way safely\r\nthrough the thickest mist and darkest clouds. Agile and light-footed,\r\ngentle and peaceable, proud and courageous, they lead a happy life among\r\nthe mountains, as long as man does not molest them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJACKO WITH PUSSY\'S BONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJacko is a bird called a Macaw, and has fine feathers--scarlet and\r\nyellow and blue. Jacko can talk a little. He says, "Come along, Jacko,\r\ncome along;" and when you come, as soon as he thinks you near enough, he\r\npecks at you with his great beak. When he is in a good temper he will\r\nsay, "Poor, poor!" He will sit upon the ivy all the morning and talk to\r\nhimself, and he will call the gardener, and he will cough and sneeze,\r\nand crow and cackle, in a very funny manner. If Jacko sees sparrows\r\npicking up a few crumbs, he will rush up, sweeping his great wings along\r\nthe ground, and take their meal for himself. If he sees poor Pussy\r\npicking a bone, he takes great delight in creeping down from his ivy,\r\nhelping himself down with beak and claws, and at a sight of Jacko\'s\r\napproach Pussy darts away, leaving the bone in Jacko\'s possession.\r\nPussy, of course, does not like this, but stands at a respectable\r\ndistance, and with curved back and flashing eyes shows her indignation\r\nat Jacko. Presently Jacko retires to the ivy and Pussy resumes her\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMBERS OF THE POACHING FRATERNITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the various wild animals which inhabit the earth, it is difficult\r\nto decide which are really friendly and which are really hostile to\r\nman\'s interests. The actual fact appears to be that there is neither\r\nhostility nor friendship. If farmers and gardeners kill off too many\r\nbirds, nature revenges herself by sending a plague of insects which the\r\nsmall birds, if alive, would have eaten. Gamekeepers ruthlessly shoot\r\nhawks and kites, or snare stoats and polecats, with the result that\r\ntheir game grows up too thick for its feeding ground, sickly specimens\r\nare allowed to linger on, and a destructive murrain follows. The rook,\r\nno doubt, is fond of eggs; but nevertheless he does the farmer good\r\nservice when he devours the grubs which are turned up by the plow; and\r\nas the salmon disease, which of late has proved so destructive, is\r\nattributed by the best authorities to overcrowding, that glossy-coated\r\nfisherman, the otter, is really a benefactor to the followers of Izaak\r\nWalton\'s gentle craft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEDDY\'S BREAKFAST.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COW WORKING A PUMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy informant writes me as follows: "We have a wonderful cow here--about\r\nten years old, and very clever at opening gates and breaking fences.\r\nThere is an Abyssinnian pump about three feet high in the center of the\r\nfield, near my house, over a trough, which is, or ought to be, filled\r\ndaily. It was on a hot day, when my man had omitted to pump the trough\r\nfull, that the cow was first observed to help herself: the way in which\r\nshe managed to pump was by pushing the handle up with her head and then\r\nforcing it down with her horns. Very little elevation of the handle is\r\nrequired to get water, and she would work it for five minutes together,\r\nand sometimes drank from the spout, and sometimes from the trough."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARRIER PIGEONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe carrier pigeon is remarkable for the degree in which it possesses\r\nthe instinct and power of returning from a distance to its accustomed\r\nhome. In Eastern countries it is the practice to bathe the pigeon\'s feet\r\nin vinegar to keep them cool, and to prevent it from alighting in quest\r\nof water, by which the letter might sustain injury. Pigeons intended for\r\nthis use must be brought from the place to which they are to return,\r\nwithin a short period, and must be kept in the dark and without food for\r\nat least eight hours before being let loose. The carrier pigeon was of\r\ngreat service during the siege of Paris in 1871, and conveyed many\r\nimportant messages. It goes through the air at the rate of thirty miles\r\nan hour, but has been known to fly even faster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GOLDEN EAGLE.\r\n\r\nTHE STORK.\r\n\r\nTHE VIRGINIAN HORNED OWL.\r\n\r\nTHE CRANE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WHALE.\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE RHINOCEROS.\r\n\r\nTHE HIPPOPOTAMUS, OR BEHEMOTH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIASIN, OR ANTELOPE OF INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Siasin, or Antelope of India, roams over the open and rocky plains\r\nof that immense country. It is distinguished from the rest of its family\r\nby the beauty and singular shape of its horns, which are annulated or\r\nringed, and spirally convoluted or curved together, making two or more\r\nturns, according to the age of the animal. The fakirs and dervishes of\r\nIndia, who are enjoined by their religion from carrying swords,\r\nfrequently wear at their girdles the polished horns of the siasin\r\ninstead of the usual military arm. This antelope is one of the\r\nfleetest-footed of its family, and its leap is something wonderful. It\r\nis not uncommon for it to vault to the height of twelve or thirteen\r\nfeet, passing over ten or twelve yards at a single bound. In color it is\r\nalmost black on the upper part of the body, and light-colored beneath.\r\nWhen full grown, it is about the size of our common deer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON SNIPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese birds frequent swampy woods, marshes, morasses, and the borders of\r\nrivers. Their usual time for seeking their food is early in the morning\r\nand during the twilight of the evening. They subsist principally upon\r\ninsects and worms; for these they search among the decayed leaves, and\r\nprobe the mud and ooze with their lengthened bills. When alarmed, they\r\ngenerally lie close to the ground, or among the grass, or, suddenly\r\nstarting on the wing, escape by flight, which is short but elevated,\r\nrapid, and irregular. The eggs, which are four in number, are deposited\r\non the ground. In the snipe, and all its immediate allies, the bill is\r\nthickened, soft, and very tender at its extremity; so that this part,\r\nwhich is richly supplied with nerves, serves as a delicate organ of\r\ntouch, and is used for searching in the soft ground for the insects and\r\nworms that constitute the food of these birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VISIT TO THE MONKEYS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD--THE DOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nGraceful and gentle is the Doe;\r\n  Its tawny coat how sleek!\r\nHow bright yet tender are its eyes!\r\n  Its glance how softly meek!\r\n\r\n\r\nE--THE EAGLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the lonely mountain peak\r\n  The eagle builds her nest,\r\nAnd there, when weary of the chase,\r\n  In silence takes her rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nF--THE FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox will skulk in ferny brake,\r\n  Yet loves the haunts of men;\r\nAnd prowls around the farm, to pounce\r\n  On capon, goose, or hen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. BUNNY AND FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis wild Rabbit has been startled by some noise, and the next moment\r\nshe may be scampering away to her burrow, with the little bunnies, at\r\nthe top of their speed, and crouch there until all is quiet again.\r\nRabbits usually select, if possible, a sandy soil overgrown with furze,\r\nin which to make their burrows, as such a soil is easily removed, and\r\nthe dense prickly furze hides their retreat, whilst it affords them a\r\nwholesome and never-failing food. These furze bushes are constantly\r\neaten down, as far as the rabbits can reach standing on their hind legs,\r\nand consequently present the appearance of a solid mass with the surface\r\neven and rounded. These animals retire into their burrows by day to\r\nrest, and come out only in the twilight to obtain food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LYNX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe body of the lynx, beautifully spotted with black and brown rings, is\r\nmore solid and hardy than that of the wild cat. His ears are longer, his\r\ntail is shorter, his great eyes light up like bright flames; and since\r\nhe prowls about chiefly at night, he is thought to have very keen sight.\r\nFor this reason, when we wish to say that a person can see very clearly\r\nor can look beyond the outward appearance of things, we call him\r\n_lynx-eyed_. Like all cats, the lynx possesses in his mustache a very\r\ncorrect power of feeling. This, with the sense of hearing and sight,\r\nguides him in all his expeditions.\r\n\r\nThe lynx in the picture is in the act of springing upon a timid hare.\r\nAlthough he can measure twenty paces in a jump, I think for once he has\r\nmade a misstep, and the dear little creature with one more bound will be\r\nsafe. One very remarkable fact about these animals is this: if there are\r\nseveral together, and one starts over the snow in pursuit of booty, all\r\nthe others will follow in exactly the same tracks, so that it will look\r\nas if but one lynx had passed over the snow-covered earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOOD MORNING, BIRDIE!]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWAN AND THE DRAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly, in majestic silence,\r\n  Sailed a Swan upon a lake;\r\nRound about him, never quiet,\r\n  Swam a noisy quacking Drake.\r\n\r\n"Swan," exclaimed the latter, halting,\r\n  "I can scarcely comprehend\r\nWhy I never hear you talking:\r\n  Are you really dumb, my friend?"\r\n\r\nSaid the Swan, by way of answer:\r\n  "I have wondered, when you make\r\nSuch a shocking, senseless clatter,\r\n  Whether you are deaf, Sir Drake!"\r\n\r\nBetter, like the Swan, remain in\r\n  Silence grave and dignified,\r\nThan keep, drake-like, ever prating,\r\n  While your listeners deride.\r\n\r\nW. R.

Here they assemble in hundreds to assist each\r\nother in the construction of their dams, and in the building of their\r\nhouses, which are put together with a considerable amount of engineering\r\nskill. The materials used in building the dams are wood, stones, and\r\nmud, which they collect themselves for that purpose, and after finishing\r\nthe dam, or winter storehouse, they collect their stores for the\r\nwinter\'s use, and then make a connection with their houses in the banks.\r\nTheir skins are valuable in making fine hats, and their flesh is much\r\nrelished by the hunters. The beaver is an interesting animal in many\r\nrespects, and the expression "busy as a beaver" is borne out by its\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TURTLE-DOVE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CUCKOO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEACOCK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TAME, OR MUTE SWAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LIONESS AND CUBS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LEOPARD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SYRIAN BEAR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JACKAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIONESS AND CUBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lioness is much smaller than the lion, and her form is more slender\r\nand graceful. She is devoid of the mane of her lord and master, and has\r\nfour or five cubs at a birth, which are all born blind. The young lions\r\nare at first obscurely striped and spotted. They mew like cats, and are\r\nas playful as kittens. As they get older, the uniform color is gradually\r\nassumed. The mane appears in the males at the end of ten or twelve\r\nmonths, and at the age of eighteen months it is very considerably\r\ndeveloped, and they begin to roar. Both in nature and in a state of\r\ncaptivity the lioness is very savage as soon as she becomes a mother,\r\nand the lion himself is then most to be dreaded, as he will then brave\r\nalmost any risk for the sake of his lioness and family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PET JACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first fish I ever saw in an aquarium, twenty years ago, was a\r\n"Jack," as he is called when young, or a "Pike," when he grows older;\r\nand ever since then I have contrived to have a pet one, and this, drawn\r\nfrom life by Mr. Harrison Weir, is an accurate portrait of the one I now\r\npossess in the Crystal Palace Aquarium. There he is, just as he steals\r\nround the corner of a bit of rock. He is glaring at a minnow, at which\r\nhe is taking most accurate aim; he hardly seems to move, but yet he does\r\nby a very trifling motion of the edge of his back fin--sometimes resting\r\na little on the tips of his two foremost fins, as they touch the ground,\r\ncarefully calculating his distance; and then, at the very moment when\r\nthe minnow has got into a position which leaves a space of clear water\r\nin front, so that Mr. Jack shall not hurt his nose against any hard\r\nsubstance when he gets carried on by the violence of his rush, he darts\r\nat the minnow with the speed of Shakspeare\'s Puck:--\r\n\r\n"I go, I go! look, how I go!\r\nSwifter than arrow from the Tartar\'s bow."\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWALLOW\'S NEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nOften in former years the twitter of the birds glittering in the morning\r\nsun was the first sound that met my ear during the wakeful hours which\r\nfrequently accompany illness after the worst crisis has passed, and you\r\nare recovering by degrees. The gutters ran beneath my bedroom windows,\r\nand I could see the steel-blue backs of the swallows as they sat on the\r\nrims of the gutter, twisting their little heads, opening their\r\nyellow-lined beaks, singing to their hearts\' content. Whole families\r\nwould perch there together, or the young would rest in rows of four or\r\nfive, according to the nest-broods of each. How delightful to see them\r\nfed by their agile parents! how tantalizing to have them almost within\r\nreach of my hands, yet not to be able to catch them or give them a kiss,\r\nas they would cower in my hollow hands if I only could have got them in\r\nthere!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRAVE DOG OF ST.

And the baby, with cocked ears and glistening eyes,\r\npromises to do as it is told. But after all it will probably prove a\r\nfalse alarm, for this is not the time of year for deerstalking; and I\r\ndare say the noise they heard was made by a party of people coming up\r\nthe valley below to see the waterfall, which is famous in the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHOOPING CRANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Whooping Crane is much larger than the common crane, which it\r\notherwise much resembles except in color; its plumage, in its adult\r\nstate, is pure white, the tips of the wings black. He spends the winter\r\nin the southern parts of North America, and in summer migrates far\r\nnorthwards. The crane feeds on roots, seeds, etc., as well as on\r\nreptiles, worms, insects, and on some of the smaller quadrupeds. They\r\njourney in flocks from fifty to a hundred, and rise to an immense height\r\nin the air, uttering their loud harsh cries, and occasionally alighting\r\nto seek food in fields or marshes; and when they descend on a field they\r\ndo sad havoc to the crops, several doing sentinel duty while the\r\nmajority are feeding. In general it is a very peaceful bird, both in its\r\nown society and those of the forest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RAVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE RING-DOVE.\r\n\r\nTHE HOOPOE.\r\n\r\nTHE COCK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE IBEX, OR ROCK GOAT.\r\n\r\nDEER.\r\n\r\nTHE SYRIAN GOAT.\r\n\r\nTHE ROE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the largest existing species of the deer family, and is a native\r\nof the northern parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It grows to be six\r\nfeet high and twelve hundred pounds in weight. They are very rare in\r\nEurope and this country, but at one time they extended as far south as\r\nthe Ohio River. They love the woods and marshy places, and live off of\r\nthe branches of trees, being unable to eat grass unless they get upon\r\ntheir knees. They are very timid, and not easily approached by the\r\nhunter, but should a dog come in the way, one stroke from an elk\'s foot\r\nwill kill it. Many of the parents of our little friends in Maine and\r\nCanada are, no doubt, familiar with the elk and its habits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOYS FOR ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe "Daily News" says: "Our readers have often doubtless observed\r\nappeals in the papers for toys for sick children. We hear that a\r\nnaturalist who feels much for animals is struck with the cruelty of\r\nleaving the creatures at the \'Zoo\' without anything to play with. This\r\ngentleman had in his possession a young otter, for whom he made a wooden\r\nball, to the extreme delight of his pet, who used to divert his simple\r\ninstinct with it for whole hours at a stretch. Following up the idea,\r\nthe same gentleman presented the elephants and rhinoceroses in the\r\nZoological Gardens with globes for diversion suited to their sizes, but\r\nit seems the elephants took to playing ball so furiously, that \'there\r\nwas danger of their houses being swept down altogether; so they were\r\nforbidden to use them indoors.\' The polar bear was given a toy which, we\r\nare told, \'amuses him immensely.\'"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUCKING-PIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other day our children came home delighted at having seen a little\r\npig drinking out of a bottle, just like a baby. I went to see it, and I\r\nwas introduced to its owner, who lived in a cottage, the principal room\r\nof which was painted light blue. A good-natured old woman was there with\r\nher two orphan grand-children. The red tiles of the cottage floor were\r\nenlivened by a gray-and-white cat, and a shiny-skinned little pig, of\r\nabout a month old, which was fed out of a feeding-bottle. This was the\r\nhero of the place.\r\n\r\nThe little pig is grateful for good treatment, and as capable of\r\nattachment as a horse or a dog. The pig is intelligent, and it can be\r\ntaught tricks. Performing pigs are often the attractions of country\r\nfairs. I have seen pigs in the poor neighborhoods of London follow their\r\nmasters through noisy streets, and into busy public-houses, where they\r\nlaid down at their masters\' feet like a dog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBELL-RINGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a child, my father took me to see some feats performed by some\r\ntraveling cats. They were called "the bell-ringers," and were\r\nrespectively named Jet, Blanche, Tom, Mop, and Tib.\r\n\r\nFive bells were hung at regular intervals on a round hoop erected on a\r\nsort of stage. A rope was attached to each bell after the manner of\r\nchurch bells. At a given signal from their master, they all sprang to\r\ntheir feet, and at a second signal, each advanced to the ropes, and\r\nstanding on their hind feet, stuck their front claws firmly into the\r\nropes, which were in that part covered with worsted, or something of the\r\nkind, so as to give the claws a firmer hold. There was a moment\'s\r\npause--then No. 1 pulled his or her rope, and so sounded the largest\r\nbell; No. 2 followed, then No. 3, and so on, till a regular peal was\r\nrung with almost as much precision and spirit as though it were human\r\nhands instead of cats\' claws that effected it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUINEA-PIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Guinea-pig is a native of South America, and is remarkable for the\r\nbeauty and variety of its colors, and the neatness of its appearance.\r\nThese little pets are very careful in keeping themselves and their\r\noffspring neat and tidy, and may be frequently seen smoothing and\r\ndressing their fur, somewhat in the manner of a cat. After having\r\nsmoothed and dressed each other\'s fur, both turn their attention to\r\ntheir young, from whose coats they remove the smallest speck of dirt, at\r\nthe same time trying to keep their hair smooth and unruffled. The\r\nGuinea-pig feeds on bread, grain, fruit, vegetables, tea leaves, and\r\nespecially garden parsley, to which it is very partial. It generally\r\ngives birth to seven and eight young at a time, and they very soon are\r\nable to take care of themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAITHFUL FRIENDS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nJ--THE JAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Methinks the Jay\'s a noisy bird,\r\n  Yet now with crimson breast,\r\nSilent and fond, she watches o\'er\r\n  The treasures of her nest._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nK--THE KANGAROO.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The timid Kangaroo frequents\r\n  The wild Australian brakes;\r\nWith long hind-legs and fore-legs short\r\n  Tremendous leaps he takes._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nL--THE LION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_With tawny hide and flowing mane,\r\n  And loud-resounding roar,\r\nOf animals the Lion\'s king,\r\n  And all bow down before._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAITING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting for master to come down the stair,\r\nAre "Noble" and "Floss," and his favorite mare--\r\n"Brenda" the gentle, with skin soft and gray,\r\nWaiting the signal, "Now off and away."\r\n\r\nNoble stands holding the whip and the rein,\r\nHis gaze fixed on Brenda, who tosses her mane;\r\nWhile dear little Floss sits quietly by,\r\nWinking and blinking her liquid brown eye.\r\n\r\nMaster\'s so kind to them--nothing to fear\r\nHave horse or dogs when his footsteps they hear;\r\nLook how they\'re waiting with eagerness there,\r\nReady to go with him everywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd what a pleasure it is when these three\r\nThere on the staircase their kind master see;\r\nNow he is mounted, the waiting is o\'er--\r\nFloss, Brenda, and Noble race off from the door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BABOON.\r\n\r\nTHE ORANG-OUTAN.\r\n\r\nTHE BARBARY APE.\r\n\r\nTHE MARIMONDA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FOUR-HORNED RAM.\r\n\r\nTHE CHAMOIS.\r\n\r\nTHE ETHIOPIAN HOG.\r\n\r\nTHE OTTER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Argus is a bird with magnificent plumage; it inhabits the forests of\r\nJava and Sumatra, and takes its place beside the pheasant, from which it\r\nonly differs in being unprovided with spurs, and by the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of the secondary feathers of the wings in the male. The tail\r\nis large and round, and the two middle feathers are extremely long and\r\nquite straight. When paraded, as it struts round the female, spreading\r\nits wings and tail, this bird presents to the dazzled eye of the\r\nspectator two splendid bronze-colored fans, upon which is sprinkled a\r\nprofusion of bright marks much resembling eyes. It owes its name of\r\nArgus to these spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MONKEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little Monkey chanced to find\r\nA walnut in its outward rind;\r\nHe snatched the prize with eager haste,\r\nAnd bit it, but its bitter taste\r\nSoon made him throw the fruit away.\r\n"I\'ve heard," he cried, "my mother say\r\n(But she was wrong), the fruit was good;\r\nPreserve me from such bitter food!"\r\nA monkey by experience taught,\r\nThe falling prize with pleasure caught;\r\nTook off the husk and broke the shell,\r\nThe kernel peeled, and liked it well.\r\n"Walnuts," said he, "are good and sweet,\r\nBut must be opened ere you eat."\r\nAnd thus in life you\'ll always find\r\nLabor comes first--reward behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLEVER FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne summer\'s day on the banks of the river Tweed, in Scotland, a fox sat\r\nwatching a brood of wild ducks feeding in the river. Presently a branch\r\nof a fir tree floated in their midst, which caused them to rise in the\r\nair, and after circling round for some time, they again settled down on\r\ntheir feeding ground. At short intervals this was repeated, the branch\r\nfloating from the same direction, until the ducks took no further notice\r\nof it than allowing it to pass by. Mr. Reynard noticed this; so he got a\r\nlarger branch than the others, and crouching down among the leaves, got\r\nafloat, and coming to the ducks, who took no notice of the branch, he\r\nseized two of the ducks, and then allowed himself to be floated to the\r\nother side, where, we suppose, he had a repast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTING HIS STRENGTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee this monster of the forest uprooting trees, as a test of its\r\nstrength before entering on a fight with one of its companions, which is\r\noften a bitter struggle for supremacy. There are two species of\r\nElephants, the Indian and African; the ears of the latter are much\r\nlarger than the Indian, covering the whole shoulder, and descending on\r\nthe legs. Elephants live in herds, and each herd has a leader--generally\r\nthe largest and most powerful animal--who exercises much control over\r\nthe herd, directing its movements, and giving the signal in the case of\r\ndanger. The trunk of the Elephant is of great service to it, and is a\r\nwonderful combination of muscle; Curier, the famous Naturalist, stating\r\nthat there is not far short of 40,000 muscles, having distinct action,\r\nand so giving it an acute sense of touch and smell--so much so, that it\r\ncan pick up a pin, or pluck the smallest leaf. The Elephant is generally\r\nabout ten feet high, and sometimes reaches to twelve feet, and lives to\r\nthe age of seventy or eighty years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WISE DOG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a curly retriever at Arundel bearing the name of "Shock," which\r\nsets an example of good manners and intelligence to the animals which\r\nare not dumb. He carries the cat of the stables tenderly in his mouth,\r\nand would carry the kitten, but at present the kitten prefers its own\r\nmeans of locomotion. When Sanger\'s elephant got into trouble in the\r\nriver Arun, this wise Shock was sent to turn him out, and his\r\nperseverance succeeded. He often will insist on carrying a bundle of\r\numbrellas to the station, and safely he delivers them to their owners,\r\nand then, with many wags of his brown tail, he demands a halfpenny for\r\nhis trouble. This halfpenny he carries to the nearest shop, lays it on\r\nthe counter, and receives his biscuit in return.

I bought him in Leadenhall Market, brought\r\nhim home, and put him into the back-garden, which is walled in. There,\r\nto that extent, he had his liberty, and many, and many a time did I\r\nwatch him from my study window walking about in the twilight among the\r\ngrass, searching for worms and other insects. And very useful was he to\r\nthe plants by so doing. When the dry weather came food got more scarce;\r\nthen Timothy was fed with bread and milk from the back-kitchen window,\r\nwhich is on a level with the stone. Soon he came to know that when he\r\nwas hungry there was the supply; and often he would come and scratch at\r\nthe glass or at the back-door for his supper, and after getting it, walk\r\noff to the garden beds to make himself useful. Few people know of the\r\ngreat use of a hedgehog in a garden, or they would be more generally\r\nkept. Our Timothy, poor fellow, however, in spite of all his good\r\nqualities, came to a bad end. A strange dog coming one day, saw him\r\nwalking about in search of his accustomed food, and pounced on him and\r\nbit him; still I had hopes of his recovery, but in a few days he died,\r\nand all of us were sorry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD ORE.\r\n\r\nSILVER ORE.\r\n\r\nTIN ORE.\r\n\r\nIRON ORE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN.\r\n\r\nMONGOLIAN.\r\n\r\nCAUCASIAN.

Charles was asleep in his tent, when he was roused by\r\na sharp, shrill cry of the bird, of "Time to rise! time to rise!"\r\naccompanied by a violent flapping of the wings. So awakened, Charles\r\nlooked around, wondering what had disturbed his feathered friend. The\r\ncause was soon plain--a deadly snake lay coiled up close to his bed,\r\nprepared to spring on the defenseless man. Just when he thought that all\r\nhope was at an end, the brave cockatoo sprang from his perch, seized the\r\nreptile by the neck, and held him tight till his master could summon\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARE TAKING THE WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was pike-fishing one season on the Dorset Stour below Canford Major,\r\nwhen on passing from one field to another, I disturbed a hare. The\r\nanimal at once entered an open, dry drain, and I lost sight of her.\r\nPresently, as I silently made my way plying my rod by the bank, I saw\r\nher, this time without any appearance of alarm, take to the water, and\r\nmaking her way through the sedges. She put her head to the stream so\r\nthat the force of the current, with but slight exertion by swimming on\r\nher part, carried her nearly in a straight line to the opposite bank.\r\nHere I watched her to see whether she would trundle herself like a dog,\r\nbut she merely rested a bit, letting the water run from her, and then\r\nset off at a rattling pace across the mead, which doubtless soon\r\nthoroughly dried her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTUMN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breeze is somewhat cooler growing,\r\n  The flowers less scent unfold--\r\nBut see!--the luscious grape is growing\r\n  With purple or with gold.\r\n    Now drain we up\r\n    The social cup,\r\n  When music blithe invites us--\r\nThough Winter threatens from afar\r\nOur present mirth he shall not mar,\r\n  While Autumn still delights us.\r\n\r\nYes!

We may be sure from this that they live in places and seek for\r\ntheir food in ways in which long beaks are just what they want. The fact\r\nis they are all marsh birds, and the soil of marshes being wet and soft,\r\nand full of worms, these long beaks enable them to probe it, and so get\r\nat the worms. I think the beaks of birds afford a striking example of\r\nhow good God is in adapting creatures to the mode of life He has\r\nappointed for them. The eagles and hawks, you know, are provided with\r\nstrong, short bills to enable them to seize and tear flesh. Those of\r\ncanaries and all the finches are just the very instruments to crack\r\nseeds with. Parrots, with their tremendous weapons, can crush the\r\nhardest nuts of the tropic forest. The crossbill is fitted with a\r\nwonderful tool for tearing fir-cones to pieces. Robins and the other\r\nwarblers have soft bills, which are all they want for eating insects and\r\ngrubs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI would rather be my lady\'s hawk,\r\n  And perch upon her hand,\r\nThan I would be the deerhound grim,\r\n  To range this forest-land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nP--THE PELICAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On river banks, on shores of lakes,\r\n  Or marge of sounding sea,\r\nThe Pelican, in quest of fish,\r\n  Roams uncontrolled and free._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nQ--THE QUAIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n_When come the leaves and buds of spring\r\n  Then comes the swift-winged quail:\r\nBut ever quits our western lands\r\n  Before the winter pale._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nR--THE RHINOCEROS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Down to the waterside to drink,\r\n  Within the jungle\'s shade,\r\nHas come the huge Rhinoceros,\r\n  In knotty hide arrayed._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKBIRDS AND YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nA country lad having taken the nest of some blackbirds containing young\r\nones, made off with it, but was closely pursued by the parents, who\r\ntried to peck his face so as to make him give them up. Mr. Jesse relates\r\na similar instance, where a pair of old birds followed a boy into a\r\nhouse, pecking at his head while he was carrying off one of their young\r\nones. People little think of the misery they cause when they rob the\r\nbirds of their nestlings.\r\n\r\nThe bird\'s nest is thus described:\r\n\r\nNow put together odds and ends,\r\nPicked up from enemies and friends:\r\nSee bits of thread and bits of rag,\r\nJust like a little rubbish bag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA USEFUL PILOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a trained sheep kept on board a steamer plying in California.\r\nIt goes out on the gang-plank, when a flock is to be loaded, to show\r\nthat the approach is safe, and to act as pilot to the flock, which\r\nreadily follows it on to the boat. The sheep, when in a flock, are all\r\nalike timid, and it is difficult to find a leader among them, each being\r\nafraid to go first; but when one goes, they all follow after, so that\r\nthis clever sheep is very valuable. The only other way to get a flock on\r\nboard a ship is to catch one and drag it on board; but this is not such\r\na good way as having the clever "Pilot."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of the bear is "Jack." I fetched him from the West India Import\r\nDock on the 5th of November, 1870. He was running about with another\r\nbear on board ship, but the job was to catch him. After many attempts we\r\nat last put a strong collar round his neck, to which was attached a long\r\nchain, and then we got him into a large barrel, and fastened the head on\r\nwith hoop-iron, lowered him over the side of the vessel into a boat, and\r\nthen pulled to the quay, and hauled him up into a cart. For a time the\r\nlittle fellow was quiet enough, but he got very inquisitive when being\r\ndriven toward the city, and wanted to have a look round. I managed to\r\nquiet him by giving him pieces of lump sugar. He arrived safely at the\r\nCrystal Palace, and has lived in an aviary till the beginning of last\r\nmonth, when he was put into his new bear-pit. The little fellow has\r\ngrown twice the size he was when he first came. He is very playful, but\r\nsometimes shows his teeth when he is teased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUST ARRIVED!]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nS--THE SWALLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Now hovering on rapid wing,\r\n  Now down to earth, now high,\r\nAnd, circling round in airy ring\r\n  To chase the painted fly._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nT--THE TIGER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fiercest of all the beasts of prey,\r\n  With eyes that glow like fire,\r\nAnd glossy hide, who does not dread\r\n  The Tiger, yet admire?_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nU--THE URSINE OPOSSUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In hollow trees the Opossum lives,\r\n  And slumbers through the day,\r\nBut when the shades of night descend,\r\n  Goes forth in search of prey._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SINGULAR HABIT OF THE WOODCOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong several curious habits of the woodcock, described by the editor of\r\nthe _Zoologist_, its practice of carrying its young is perhaps the most\r\ninteresting. The testimony of many competent witnesses is cited to\r\ncorroborate the statement. The late L. Lloyd, in his "Scandinavian\r\nAdventures," wrote, "If, in shooting, you meet with a brood of\r\nwoodcocks, and the young ones cannot fly, the old bird takes them\r\nseparately between her feet, and flies from the dogs with a moaning\r\ncry."\r\n\r\nThe same author makes a similar statement in another work, this habit of\r\nthe woodcock having been observed by a friend.\r\n\r\nOne of the brothers Stuart gives, in "Lays of the Deer Forest," a\r\ngraphic account of the performance. He says, "As the nests are laid on\r\ndry ground, and often at a distance from moisture, in the latter case,\r\nas soon as the young are hatched, the old bird will sometimes carry them\r\nin her claws to the nearest spring or green strip. In the same manner,\r\nwhen in danger, she will rescue those which she can lift; of this we\r\nhave frequent opportunities for observation in Tarnaway. Various times\r\nwhen the hounds, in beating the ground, have come upon a brood, we have\r\nseen the old bird rise with the young one in her claws and carry it\r\nfifty or a hundred yards away."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SKY-LARK\r\n\r\n\r\nHas any one ever told you that they were "happy as a lark," and have you\r\nstopped to think how happy a lark is?--its joyous flight up into the\r\nsky, as high or higher than the sight of man can reach, singing louder\r\nand louder, and more and more gayly the higher it ascends? When the\r\nsweet hay-time comes on, and mowers are busy in the fields with their\r\ngreat scythes, it is sometimes a dangerous season for larks, who make\r\ntheir nests on the ground. Often the poor little nests must suffer; but\r\nonly think how ingenious their owners are if they do. A mower once cut\r\noff the upper part of a lark\'s nest. The lark sitting in it was\r\nuninjured. The man was very sorry for what he had done; but there was no\r\nhelp for it--at least so he thought. The lark knew better, and soon\r\nafterward a beautiful dome was found made of grass over the nest by the\r\npatient, brave bird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SILKWORM.\r\n\r\nTHE BAT.\r\n\r\nCARRION BEETLES.\r\n\r\nTHE SPIDER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SYRIAN OX.\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE.\r\n\r\nTHE MULE.\r\n\r\nTHE ARABIAN HORSE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A SEAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago a German Artist was travelling in Norway, on foot, with\r\nhis knapsack on his back and his stick in his hand. He lodged most of\r\ntime in the cottages that he fell in with on his road. In one of them\r\nthere was a seal, which the fisherman had found on the sand, after\r\nharpooning the mother of the poor animal. No sooner was it admitted into\r\nthe cottage than the seal became the friend of the family and the\r\nplaymate of the children. It played from morning till night with them,\r\nwould lick their hands, and call them with a gentle little cry, which is\r\nnot unlike the human voice, and it would look at them tenderly with its\r\nlarge blue eyes, shaded by long black lashes. It almost always followed\r\nits master to fish, swimming around the boat and taking a great many\r\nfish, which it delivered to the fisherman without even giving them a\r\nbite. A dog could not have been more devoted, faithful, teachable, or\r\neven more intelligent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING OF THE MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n"What is that, mother?"

It\r\nis the most sagacious and intelligent of all dogs, and volumes of\r\nanecdotes might be written of its intelligence and affection.\r\n\r\nMr. St. John, in his "Highland Sports," tells the following: "A shepherd\r\nonce, to prove the quickness of his dog, who was lying before the fire\r\nwhere we were talking, said to me in the middle of a sentence concerning\r\nsomething else, \'I\'m thinking, sir, the cow is in the potatoes;\' when\r\nthe dog, who appeared to be asleep, immediately jumped up, and leaping\r\nthrough the open window and on to the roof of the house, where he could\r\nget a view of the potato field, and not seeing the cow there, he looked\r\ninto the farm-yard, where she was, and finding that all was right,\r\nreturned to his old position before the fire."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRIENDLY TERNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. Edward, the Scotch naturalist shot at a Tern, hoping to\r\nsecure the beautiful creature as a specimen. The ball broke the bird\'s\r\nwing, and he fell screaming down to the water. His cries brought other\r\nterns to the rescue, and with pitiful screams they flew to the spot\r\nwhere the naturalist stood, while the tide drifted their wounded brother\r\ntoward the shore. But before Mr. Edward could secure his prize, he\r\nobserved, to his astonishment, that two of the terns had flown down to\r\nthe water, and were gently lifting up their suffering companion, one\r\ntaking hold of either wing. But their burden was rather heavy; so, after\r\ncarrying it seaward about six or seven yards, they let it down, and two\r\nmore came, picked it up, and carried it a little farther. By means of\r\nthus relieving each other they managed to reach a rock where they\r\nconcluded they would be safe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EXCITING TAIL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nY--THE YAK.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In Central Asia, far away,\r\n  \'Mid Thibet\'s pastures green,\r\nWith shaggy hide and bushy tail,\r\n  The valued Yak is seen._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nZ--THE ZEBRA.\r\n\r\n_As strong and swift as any horse,\r\n  The Zebra skims the plain;\r\nWith glossy bands of deepest black,\r\n  Long ears, and upright mane._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP AND LAMBS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The sheep were in the fold at night;\r\n  And now a new-born lamb\r\nTotters and trembles in the light,\r\n  Or bleats beside its dam.\r\n\r\nHow anxiously the mother tries,\r\n  With every tender care,\r\nTo screen it from inclement skies,\r\n  And the cold morning air!\r\n\r\nThe hail-storm of the east is fled,\r\n  She seems with joy to swell;\r\nWhile ever, as she bends her head,\r\n  I hear the tinkling bell.\r\n\r\nSo while for me a mother\'s prayer\r\n  Ascends to Heaven above,\r\nMay I repay her tender care\r\n  With gratitude and love._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WATER-RAT.\r\n\r\nTHE WILD CAT.\r\n\r\nTHE WEASEL.\r\n\r\nTHE SYRIAN DOG.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GLOW-WORM.\r\n\r\nTHE LOCUST.\r\n\r\nTHE HERCULES BEETLE.\r\n\r\nTHE CHAMELEON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTIVE SQUIRREL\r\n\r\n\r\n"Squirrel--squirrel lithe and wee!\r\nThy fur\'s as soft as down can be,\r\nThy teeth as ivory are white,\r\nYet hard enough through nuts to bite.\r\n\r\n"Squirrel--squirrel lithe and wee!\r\nHow gladly would I purchase thee--\r\nBut mother says: \'Twill never do,\r\nThou nibblest table, book and shoe.\'"\r\n\r\nSquirrel--squirrel hung his head;\r\n"Oh! speak not thus," he sadly said,\r\n"Heav\'n gave me once a woodland home\r\nWhere I the livelong day might roam,\r\nAnd gaily leap from branch to twig\r\nAs blithe and merry as a grig;\r\nThen came a wicked man who laid\r\nThe snare by which I\'m captive made,\r\nAnd now \'twill be my mournful doom\r\n  Instead of in the forest free,\r\nTo live pent in a narrow room\r\n  By way of bush or stately tree!\r\nWhat wonder if, thus sad and lorn,\r\nFrom all my dearest habits torn,\r\nA-foraging I sometimes go\r\nAnd get a snubbing or a blow?\r\nChild, should you on some summer\'s day,\r\nWithin the greenwood chance to stray,\r\nI pray you that from me you greet\r\nThe happy creatures that you meet,\r\nThe fawns, ants, sparrows and the hares\r\nAnd tell them how with me it fares,\r\nThat while they leap, creep, sing and fly.\r\nIn chains and prison I must lie."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA STROLL IN THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nPut on your hat and let us take\r\nA stroll amidst the rural scene--\r\n  The boat is gliding o\'er the lake,\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  The cows are browsing pastures green,\r\nThe herdsman\'s horns the echoes wake,\r\nAnd holiday like Nature\'s self we\'ll make!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nInto the garden next let\'s come\r\nTo pluck a pear or downy plum,\r\n  And hear the bird\'s sweet trilling--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n  While all around, on fragrant beds,\r\nThe flowerets lift their little heads,\r\nThe air with perfume filling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nThe merry kid is leaping gaily,\r\nAnd soberer Nanny gives us daily\r\n  Sweet milk to make us cheese;\r\n\r\n  While all our tastes to please,\r\nHis nets the busy fisher flings,\r\nAnd eels and carp for dinner brings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OTTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Otter belongs to a class of animals which we may call the Weasel\r\ntribe. Their bodies are long and lithe, and their legs short. This\r\nfamily includes the weasel (its smallest member), the stoat, the ferret,\r\nthe pole-cat, the marten, and the otter (its largest member). You may\r\nthen think of the Otter as a water-ferret, or water-weasel. He can swim\r\nmost elegantly, and he is a beautiful diver. Let a fish glide underneath\r\nhim, and he is after it in a moment; and as the fish darts here and\r\nthere to escape, the Otter follows each rapid movement with unerring\r\nprecision. When the fish is caught, the Otter carries it to the bank and\r\nmakes a meal. But the Otter is like naughty Jack who leaves a saucy\r\nplate--he spoils much more fish than he eats. The trout and other fish\r\nare so much alarmed at the appearance of an Otter, that they will\r\nsometimes fling themselves on the bank to get out of his way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MASTIFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mastiff is a large, grave, sullen-looking dog, with a wide chest,\r\nnoble head, long switch tail, bright eyes, and a loud, deep voice. Of\r\nall dogs this is the most vigilant watcher over the property of his\r\nmaster, and nothing can tempt him to betray the confidence reposed in\r\nhim. Notwithstanding his commanding appearance, and the strictness with\r\nwhich he guards the property of his master, the mastiff is possessed of\r\ngreat mildness of character, and is very grateful for any favors\r\nbestowed upon him. I once went into the barn of a friend where there was\r\na mastiff chained; I went up to the dog and patted him on the head, when\r\nout rushed the groom from the stable exclaiming, "Come away, sir! He\'s\r\ndangerous with strangers." But I did not remove my hand nor show any\r\nfear. The consequence was, that the dog and I were the best of friends;\r\nbut had I shown any fear, and hastily removed my hand, I might have\r\nfared rather badly, for this dog always couples fear with guilt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUNNING WOOD-PIGEONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne who loves our feathered friends has described a curious instance of\r\ntheir instinct. On the back lawn at a gentleman\'s house, they have a\r\nfeeding-box for the pheasants, which opens on their perching upon it,\r\nbut remains shut if any lesser bird than a hen pheasant perches there,\r\nwhich saves the contents from the thefts of these, and of rats, mice,\r\nand other vermin. But the gentleman discovered that the contents of the\r\nbox was being more rapidly emptied than the wants of the pheasants\r\nwarranted. So he kept a watch on the box, and soon discovered a\r\nwood-pigeon perch on the box, but his weight not being sufficient to\r\nopen the lid, he beckoned to another pigeon, and their combined weight\r\nmade the lid fly open, and after each had taken what they required, they\r\nflew away, and the box closed with a "click."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA REPTILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were in the sea in very ancient times--long before the flood--two\r\nvery large and wonderful reptiles. Of them we present striking\r\nillustrations. One of them has been named the Ichthyosaurus, which means\r\nFish Reptile. Its head somewhat resembled that of the crocodile, except\r\nthat the orbit was much larger, and had the nostril placed close to it,\r\nas in the whale, and not near the end of the snout. It had four paddles\r\nand a powerful tail, and was very active in its movements and a rapid\r\nswimmer.\r\n\r\nThe other huge reptile was the Plesiosaurus, the meaning of which is\r\n"Near to a Reptile." Its structure was very singular and its character\r\nvery strange. In the words of Buckland: "To the head of a lizard, it\r\nunited the teeth of the crocodile, a neck of enormous length, resembling\r\nthe body of a serpent, a trunk and a tail of the size of an ordinary\r\nquadruped, the ribs of a chameleon, and the paddles of a whale."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWISS MOUNTAIN SCENERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland, one of the chief employments of the people is that of\r\nherdsmen and shepherds, and nearly the half of the surface of the\r\ncountry is occupied as mountain pastures and meadows. Here you see the\r\nwoman tending the sheep and goats, and spinning industriously, while her\r\nhusband is busy with some other part of the duties of tending the sheep.\r\nIt is often painful to see how much the poor sheep and oxen suffer while\r\nbeing driven through the streets. It is pitiful to see them looking in\r\nvain for some place of rest and shelter. Little boys in towns sometimes\r\nlike to HELP--as they call it--to drive cattle, but they generally\r\nincrease the terror and confusion of the poor beasts, and little think\r\nof the pain they are causing. Sheep and goats are very useful to us;\r\nbesides serving us for food, they supply our cloth and flannel clothes,\r\nblankets, and other warm coverings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTRIDGE AND YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, while walking across a meadow, near a village, I saw a\r\ndog of the terrier breed pursuing a partridge, which every now and then\r\nturned and made at it with its wings down, then rolled over, then ran,\r\nand again rushed at the dog. I drove the dog away, when I was surprised\r\nto see a number of young partridges running from behind the old bird who\r\nhad been trying to protect them from the dog, and guarding their\r\nretreat. So you see how brave the most timid creatures become when in\r\ndanger, and when their young are near. Instinct tells them that they\r\nhave to protect their little ones, and risk everything, even their own\r\nlives, for their safety. We can get beautiful lessons every day from the\r\nbirds and poor dumb animals, if we only study them as we ought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KINGFISHERS\' HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery pretty birds were Mr. and Mrs. Kingfisher, with dark, glossy, green\r\nwings, spotted with light blue. Their tails were also light blue, and\r\nthere was a patch of yellow near their heads. The little Kingfishers\r\nwere quite as pretty as their parents, and Mr. and Mrs. Kingfisher were\r\nexceedingly proud of them.\r\n\r\n"Only they eat a great deal," said Mr. Kingfisher; "I am getting very\r\ntired."\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Kingfisher had been flying backward and forward all day, and it\r\nwas surprising to see the quantity of fish he caught for his family.\r\n\r\nWhen he built his nest he took care that it should be near a stream, and\r\nhe found one close by a high cliff that Mrs. Kingfisher said would be\r\njust the place; so they scooped out a deep hole, and there the eggs were\r\nlaid, and in due time six little Kingfishers burst out of the shells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRATS CARRYING EGGS UP STAIRS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRats are very ingenious little creatures; they have actually been known\r\nto convey eggs up a staircase, from the pantry to their nest! Here is a\r\nbeautiful picture, by Mr. Harrison Weir, from the "Children\'s Friend,"\r\nshowing how they did it.\r\n\r\nThe rat bears little resemblance to the rats with which we are chiefly\r\nacquainted, namely, the black rat, the albino or white rat, and the\r\nbrown rat. The other day, as I was walking by the river-side, I saw a\r\nbeautiful little creature sitting on a stone in the stream, with a piece\r\nof succulent root between its forepaws, and nibbling its repast in\r\nperfect peace with every living thing. It was timid and innocent in the\r\nexpression of its countenance. Its color was of a reddish brown. It was\r\nabout as large as the common rat of the sewers, but its tail was much\r\nshorter, and covered with hair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HERON ATTACKED BY A HAWK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Heron when attacked by an eagle or falcon endeavors to escape by\r\nrising in the air and getting above its foe. The wings of the heron\r\nstrike the air with an equal and regular motion which raises its body to\r\nsuch an elevation that at a distance nothing is seen except the wings,\r\nwhich are at last lost sight of in the region of the clouds.\r\n\r\nIf its enemy gets above it, and upon or near its body, it defends itself\r\nvigorously with its long and powerful beak, and often comes off\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nThe heron frequents the neighborhood of rivers and lakes. Almost always\r\nsolitary, it remains for hours motionless on the same spot. When seeking\r\nthe fish or frogs on which it chiefly feeds, the heron wades into the\r\nwater, folds its long neck partially over its back and forward again,\r\nand with watchful eye waits till a fish comes within reach of its beak,\r\nwhen it darts its head into the water and secures its slimy, slippery\r\nprey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HORSE GUARDIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a gentleman was returning home from a fatiguing journey,\r\nand became very drowsy. He fell asleep, and, strange to say, he also\r\nfell from his saddle, but in so easy a manner that the tumble did not\r\nrouse him, and lay sleeping on where he alighted. His faithful steed, on\r\nbeing eased of his burden, instead of scampering home as one might have\r\nexpected, stood by his prostrate master, and kept a strict watch over\r\nhim. Some laborers at sunrise found him very contentedly snoozing on a\r\nheap of stones. They wished to approach the gentleman, that they might\r\nawaken him, but every attempt on their part was resolutely opposed by\r\nthe grinning teeth and ready heels of his determined and faithful\r\nguardian. They called out loudly, and the gentleman awoke and was very\r\nmuch surprised at his position, while his faithful horse showed his\r\npleasure by neighing and scraping his feet on the ground. The gentleman\r\nthen mounted, and they galloped away at great speed, both glad to be\r\nable to make up for lost time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE BETWEEN A FOX AND A SWAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fierce battle between a fox and a swan took place at Sherborne Park.\r\nMaster Reynard seems to have caught the old swan napping, and to have\r\nseized him by the throat. The bird defended himself with his wings so\r\npowerfully that its assailant was done to death in no time, and a\r\nworkman going past the lake above the bridge next morning found both fox\r\nand swan lying dead together. The bird had received a fatal bite in the\r\nthroat; the fox had one leg broken and the side of its head completely\r\nbroken in. The swan was the oldest bird on the lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SAND LIZARD.\r\n\r\nTHE CROCODILE.\r\n\r\nTHE VIPER.\r\n\r\nTHE ASP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WILD BOAR.\r\n\r\nTHE BADGER.\r\n\r\nTHE FERRET.\r\n\r\nTHE LYNX.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUSY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a beautiful long-haired little dog called Tousy, which lately\r\nhad a pup. This queer little bantling was jumping and tumbling about the\r\ngreen one day, when a lady entered followed by a dog. Tousy made a\r\nferocious assault on the four-footed stranger, by way of defending her\r\nyoung, and our magnificent white cat, which was sitting on the doorstep,\r\nseeing or supposing that his friend Tousy was in danger, made two\r\nimmense bounds, and alighted on the back of the intruder, whose eyes\r\nwould have been scratched out but for prompt rescue. The mutual\r\naffection of these two animals is unbounded, and yet we hear human\r\ndisagreements compared to cat-and-dog life! These animals, and many\r\nothers, are capable of the most devoted affection to their young, and to\r\ntheir mates, and frequently teach us lessons of kindness to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEST IN THE APPLE TREE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Chatterbox Stories of Natural History, by Anonymous\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHATTERBOX STORIES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 22408.txt or 22408.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/4/0/22408/\r\n\r\nProduced by Marilynda Fraser-Cunliffe, Janet Blenkinship\r\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\r\nhttp://www.pgdp.net (This file was made using scans of\r\npublic domain works in the International Children\'s Digital\r\nLibrary.)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
