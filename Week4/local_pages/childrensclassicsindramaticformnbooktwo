The stories given are for\r\nthe most part adaptations of favorite tales from folklore,--Andersen,\r\nGrimm, \xc3\x86sop, and the Arabian Nights having been freely drawn upon.\r\n\r\nChildren are dramatic by nature. They _are_ for the time the kings, the\r\nfairies, and the heroes that they picture in their imaginations. They\r\n_are_ these characters with such abandon and with such intense pleasure\r\nthat the on-looker must believe that nature intended that they should\r\ngive play to this dramatic instinct, not so much formally, with all the\r\ntrappings of the man-made stage, but spontaneously and naturally, as\r\nthey talk and read. If this expressive instinct can be utilized in the\r\nteaching of reading, we shall be able both to add greatly to the child\'s\r\nenjoyment and to improve the quality of his oral reading. In these days\r\nwhen so many books are hastily read in school, there is a tendency to\r\nsacrifice expression to the mechanics and interpretation of reading.\r\nThose acquainted with school work know too well the resulting\r\nmonotonous, indistinct speech and the self-conscious, listless attitude\r\nwhich characterize so much of the reading of pupils in grades above the\r\nthird. It is believed that these readers will aid in overcoming these\r\nserious faults in reading, which all teachers and parents deplore. The\r\ndramatic appeal of the stories will cause the child to lose himself in\r\nthe character he is impersonating and read with a naturalness and\r\nexpressiveness unknown to him before, and this improvement will be\r\nevident in all his oral reading, and even in his speech.\r\n\r\nThe use of the books permits the whole range of expression, from merely\r\nreading the stories effectively, to "acting them out" with as little, or\r\nas much, stage-setting or costuming as a parent or teacher may desire.\r\nThe stories are especially designed to be read as a part of the regular\r\nreading work. Many different plans for using the books will suggest\r\nthemselves to the teacher. After a preliminary reading of a story during\r\nthe study period, the teacher may assign different parts to various\r\nchildren, she herself reading the stage directions and the other brief\r\ndescriptions unclosed in brackets. The italicized explanations in\r\nparentheses are not intended to be read aloud; they will aid in giving\r\nthe child the cue as to the way the part should be rendered. After the\r\nstory has been read in this way, if thought advisable it can be played\r\ninformally and simply, with no attempt at costuming or theatric effects.\r\nIt will often add to the interest of the play to have some of the\r\nchildren represent certain of the inanimate objects of the scene, as the\r\nforest, the town gate, a door, etc. Occasionally, for the "open day," or\r\nas a special exercise, a favorite play may be given by the children with\r\nthe simplest kind of costuming and stage-setting. These can well be made\r\nin the school as a part of the manual training and sewing work. In\r\ngiving the play, it will generally be better not to have pupils memorize\r\nthe exact words of the book, but to depend upon the impromptu rendering\r\nof their parts. This method will contribute more largely to the training\r\nin English.\r\n\r\nThe best results will usually be obtained by using this book in the\r\nthird grade. In some schools, however, it may profitably be used in the\r\nsecond grade.\r\n\r\nA.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLEVER KID\r\n _Suggested by \xc3\x86sop\'s The Wolf and the Goat._\r\n\r\nTHE WOLF AND THE HORSE\r\n _Suggested by \xc3\x86sop\'s The Wolf and the Horse._\r\n\r\nTHE WISE CROW\r\n _Suggested by \xc3\x86sop\'s The Crow and the Pitcher._\r\n\r\nTHE WOLF AND THE LAMB\r\n _Suggested by \xc3\x86sop\'s The Wolf and the Lamb._\r\n\r\nTHE SELFISH WOMAN\r\n _Suggested by the folk-story, The Red-Headed\r\nWoodpecker._\r\n\r\nTHE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT\r\n _From the folk-story, The Blind Men._\r\n\r\nTHE STAG AND THE FAWN\r\n _Suggested by \xc3\x86sop\'s The Stag at the Pool._\r\n\r\nTHE SHEPHERD-BOY WHO CALLED WOLF\r\n _Suggested by \xc3\x86sop\'s The Shepherd-Boy\r\nand the Wolf._\r\n\r\nTHE WISH-BIRD\r\n _Suggested by a German folk-story._\r\n\r\nLAZY KATE\r\n _Suggested by the German folk-story, Lazy Lizette._\r\n\r\nTHE PROUD RING-FINGER\r\n _Suggested by the German folk-story, The Proud\r\nRingfinger._\r\n\r\nTHE TWO MILLERS\r\n _Suggested by the German folk-story, The Two Millers._\r\n\r\nTHE VAIN JACKDAW\r\n _Suggested by \xc3\x86sop\'s The Vain Jackdaw._\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE JACKAL AND THE CAMEL\r\n _Suggested by the Oriental legend.

Farmer Knave does claim my colt, Prince.\r\n\r\nPRINCE. How is this, Farmer Knave?\r\n\r\nKNAVE. I claim the colt because the colt is mine, Prince.\r\n\r\nPRINCE. Now how is this, Farmer Nix?\r\n\r\nNIX. The colt is mine, Prince.\r\n\r\nKNAVE. The colt is mine I say!\r\n\r\nNIX. I say the colt is mine!\r\n\r\nPRINCE. Hush, Farmer Nix! Hush, Farmer Knave! I\'ll tell the king what\r\nboth of you do claim. He will decide to whom the colt belongs.\r\n\r\n[_The Prince goes._]\r\n\r\nKNAVE. See how the colt lies between my oxen! Is not that proof that he\r\nis mine?\r\n\r\nNIX. But who can tell what a colt will do?\r\n\r\n[_The_ PRINCE _comes._]\r\n\r\nPRINCE. Farmers, the king has decided. He says the colt belongs where it\r\nis now lying.\r\n\r\nKNAVE. And he lies between my oxen.\r\n\r\nPRINCE. That is proof enough, The colt belongs to you, Farmer Knave.\r\n\r\nNIX. But, Prince--\r\n\r\nPRINCE. Not another word! Go, now, with your wagons and horses and oxen!\r\nThe queen comes out to walk. Go, all of you!\r\n\r\n[_The Prince enters the castle.

The queen wants to see you, sir.\r\n\r\n[_Nix goes to the Queen and bows._]\r\n\r\nQUEEN. I heard all from the castle window. I know the colt is yours.\r\n\r\nNIX. I thank you, my Queen, I thank you!\r\n\r\nQUEEN. Now you must show the king that colts cannot belong to oxen,\r\nnever have belonged to oxen, and never will belong to oxen.\r\n\r\nNIX. I will go to him at once! I will tell him--\r\n\r\nQUEEN. Not so fast! I said you must show the king. He would not let you\r\ntell him. No one ever dares to tell things to a king.\r\n\r\nNIX. How can I show him?\r\n\r\nQUEEN. You must think out the way. I cannot help you more.\r\n\r\nNIX. I thank you, my Queen, I thank you.\r\n\r\nQUEEN. The king comes out to walk soon.\r\n\r\nNIX. I will return to show him.\r\n\r\n[_Nix bows to the Queen and goes. The_ KING _and_ PRINCE _come from the\r\ncastle._]\r\n\r\nQUEEN. \'Tis a pleasant day to walk, dear King.\r\n\r\nKING.

He throws out his net and draws it in! He acts just as if he were\r\nfishing.\r\n\r\nQUEEN. Let\'s ask what he is doing.\r\n\r\nKING. Come here, you foolish fellow! Come here, I say!\r\n\r\n(NIX _comes to the King, but goes on with his fishing._)\r\n\r\nNow what are you doing, sir?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNIX. I am fishing, fishing, fishing.\r\n\r\nKING. How can you fish where is no water?\r\n\r\nNIX. Fish can be found on land if colts belong to oxen.\r\n\r\nKING. What is that, sir?\r\n\r\nNIX. If colts belong to oxen, then fish should swim in dust.\r\n\r\nKING. Well, well, that may be true! What do you think, dear Queen?\r\n\r\nQUEEN. I think with you--it may be true.\r\n\r\nNIX (_fishing_). If colts belong to oxen, then I will always fish in\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nKING. Well, well, I think you may be right, sir!\r\n\r\n(_Pause. The King thinks deeply._)\r\n\r\nYes, I am now sure that you are right, sir. Go get your colt from Farmer\r\nKnave. Go with him, Prince, and see to it.

It is this needle in this box. It talks whenever I wish it.\r\n\r\nPOWHATAN. What does it say?\r\n\r\nSMITH. It tells me where to find the north. I turn the box this way,--I\r\nturn the box that way. But the needle always shows the north to me.\r\n\r\nPOWHATAN. Why, so it does! It is very strange and wonderful!\r\n\r\nA BRAVE. Will it tell the north at night?\r\n\r\nSMITH. In the darkest night it tells you.\r\n\r\nANOTHER BRAVE. Will it tell the north on water?\r\n\r\nSMITH. On river or on lake it tells you.\r\n\r\nPOWHATAN. Come, show me how to make it talk.\r\n\r\nSMITH. Will you let me go in peace?\r\n\r\nPOWHATAN. You shall live and go in peace.\r\n\r\nMEDICINE MAN. Great chief, is it wise to let so wise a man go from us?\r\n\r\nPOWHATAN. Is it your wish to keep him here?\r\n\r\nMEDICINE MAN. There is no place for such a wise man.\r\n\r\nPOWHATAN. What do you mean?\r\n\r\nMEDICINE MAN. Let him go, or let him stay, he will only make more wise\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nPOWHATAN. That is true.\r\n\r\nMEDICINE MAN. Things too wise for Powhatan\'s braves. Things too wise for\r\nPowhatan.\r\n\r\nPOWHATAN. What is that? Things too wise for Powhatan!\r\n\r\nMEDICINE MAN. The white man makes talking needles. This needle shows the\r\nnorth to him.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n'
