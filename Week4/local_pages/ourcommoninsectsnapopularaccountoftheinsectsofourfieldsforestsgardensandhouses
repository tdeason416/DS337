SCUDDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SCUDDER:--You and I were drawn together many years ago by a\r\ncommon love for insects and their ways.\r\n\r\nI dedicate this little volume of ephemeral essays to you in recognition\r\nof your worth as a man and a scientist, and as a token of warm\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n  Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n  A. S. PACKARD, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little volume mainly consists of a reprint of a series of essays\r\nwhich appeared in the "American Naturalist" (Vols. i-v, 1867-71). It is\r\nhoped that their perusal may lead to a better acquaintance with the\r\nhabits and forms of our more common insects. The introduction was\r\nwritten expressly for this book, as well as Chapter XIII, "Hints on the\r\nAncestry of Insects." The scientific reader may be drawn with greater\r\ninterest to this chapter than to any other portion of the book. In this\r\ndiscussion of a perhaps abstruse and difficult theme, his indulgence is\r\nsought for whatever imperfections or deficiencies may appear. Our\r\nsystems of classification may at least be tested by the application of\r\nthe theory of evolution. The natural system, if we mistake not, is the\r\ngenealogy of organized forms; when we can trace the latter, we establish\r\nthe former. Considering how much naturalists differ in their views as to\r\nwhat is a natural classification, it is not strange that a genealogy of\r\nanimals or plants seems absurd to many. To another generation of\r\nnaturalists it must, perhaps, be left to decide whether to attempt the\r\none is more unphilosophical than to attempt the other.\r\n\r\nMost of the cuts have already appeared in the "Guide to the Study of\r\nInsects" and the "American Naturalist," where their original sources are\r\ngiven, while a few have been kindly contributed by Prof. A. E. Verrill,\r\nthe Boston Society of Natural History, and Prof. C. V. Riley, and three\r\nare original.\r\n\r\nSALEM, June, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR COMMON INSECTS.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What is an Insect?_ When we remember that the insects alone comprise\r\nfour-fifths of the animal kingdom, and that there are upwards of 200,000\r\nliving species, it would seem a hopeless task to define what an insect\r\nis. But a common plan pervades the structure of them all. The bodies of\r\nall insects consist of a succession of rings, or segments, more or less\r\nhardened by the deposition of a chemical substance called chitine; these\r\nrings are arranged in three groups: the head, the thorax, or middle\r\nbody, and the abdomen or hind body. In the six-footed insects, such as\r\nthe bee, moth, beetle or dragon fly, four of these rings unite early in\r\nembryonic life to form the head; the thorax consists of three, as may be\r\nreadily seen on slight examination, and the abdomen is composed either\r\nof ten or eleven rings. The body, then, seems divided or _insected_ into\r\nthree regions, whence the name _insect_.\r\n\r\nThe head is furnished with a pair of antenn\xc3\xa6, a pair of jaws\r\n(mandibles), and two pairs of maxill\xc3\xa6, the second and basal pair being\r\nunited at their base to form the so-called labium, or under lip. These\r\nfour pairs of appendages represent the four rings of the head, to which\r\nthey are appended in the order stated above.\r\n\r\nA pair of legs is appended to each of the three rings of the thorax;\r\nwhile the first and second rings each usually carry a pair of wings.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen contains the ovipositor; sometimes, as in the bees and\r\nwasps, forming a sting. In the spiders (Fig. 1), however, there are no\r\nantenn\xc3\xa6, and the second maxill\xc3\xa6, or labium, is wanting. Moreover, there\r\nare four pairs of legs. The centipedes (Fig. 2, a Myriopod) also differ\r\nfrom the rest of the insects in having an indefinite number of abdominal\r\nrings, each bearing a pair of legs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Spider (Tegenaria).]\r\n\r\nOn examining the arrangement of the parts within, we find the nervous\r\ncord, consisting of two chains of swellings, or nerve-knots, resting\r\nupon the floor or under side of the body; and the heart, or dorsal\r\nvessel, situated just under the skin of the back; and in looking at\r\nliving caterpillars, such as the cut-worm, and many thin-skinned aquatic\r\nlarv\xc3\xa6, we can see this long tubular heart pulsating about as often as\r\nour own heart, and when the insect is held against its will, or is\r\nagitated, the rapidity of the pulsations increases just as with us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2. Centipede.]\r\n\r\nInsects do not breathe as in the higher animals by taking the air into\r\nthe mouth and filling the lungs, but there are a series of holes or\r\npores along the side of the body, as seen in the grub of the humble bee,\r\nthrough which the air enters and is conveyed to every part of the body\r\nby an immense number of air tubes. (Fig. 3, air tubes, or trache\xc3\xa6, in\r\nthe caudal appendage of the larva of a dragon fly). These air tubes are\r\neverywhere bathed by the blood, by which the latter becomes oxygenated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3. Caudal appendage of larva of Agrion.]\r\n\r\nIndeed the structure of an insect is entirely different from that of man\r\nor the quadrupeds, or any other vertebrate animal, and what we call\r\nhead, thorax, abdomen, gills, stomach, skin, or lungs, or jaws, are\r\ncalled so simply for convenience, and not that they are made in the same\r\nway as those parts in the higher animals.\r\n\r\nAn insect differs from a horse, for example, as much as a modern\r\nprinting press differs from the press Franklin used. Both machines are\r\nmade of iron, steel, wood, etc., and both print; but the plan of their\r\nstructure differs throughout, and some parts are wanting in the simpler\r\npress which are present and absolutely essential in the other. So with\r\nthe two sorts of animals; they are built up originally out of\r\nprotoplasm, or the original jelly-like germinal matter, which fills the\r\ncells composing their tissues, and nearly the same chemical elements\r\noccur in both, but the mode in which these are combined, the arrangement\r\nof their products: the muscular, nervous and skin tissues, differ in the\r\ntwo animals. The plan of structure, namely, the form and arrangement of\r\nthe body walls, the situation of the appendages to the body, and of the\r\nanatomical systems within, i.e., the nervous, digestive, circulatory,\r\nand respiratory systems, differ in their position in relation to the\r\nwalls of the body. Thus while the two sorts of animals reproduce their\r\nkind, eat, drink and sleep, see, hear and smell, they perform these acts\r\nby different kinds of organs, situated sometimes on the most opposite\r\nparts of the body, so that there is no comparison save in the results\r\nwhich they accomplish; they only agree in being animals, and in having a\r\ncommon animal nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4. Different forms of jaws.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5. Mouth parts of the Larva of a Beetle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6. Maxilla of a Beetle.]\r\n\r\n_How Insects Eat._ The jaws of insects (Fig. 4) are horny processes\r\nsituated on each side of the mouth. They are variously toothed, so as to\r\ntear the food, and move horizontally instead of up and down as in the\r\nhorse. The act of taking the food, especially if the insect be\r\ncarnivorous in its habits, is quite complex, as not only the true jaws,\r\nbut the accessory jaws (maxill\xc3\xa6, Fig. 5, _a_, upper, b, under side of\r\nthe head of a young beetle; _at_, antenn\xc3\xa6, _md_, mandible, _mx_,\r\nmaxill\xc3\xa6, _mx_[1], labium) and the feelers (palpi) attached to the\r\nmaxill\xc3\xa6, and the under lip (labium) are of great service in enabling the\r\ninsect to detect its food both by the senses of touch and smell. The\r\nmaxill\xc3\xa6 are in the fully grown beetle (Fig. 6) divided into three lobes,\r\nthe outermost forming the palpus, and the two others forming sharp\r\nteeth, often provided with hairs and minute brushes for cleansing the\r\nadjoining parts; these strong curved teeth are used in seizing the food\r\nand placing it between the grinders, where it is crushed, prepared for\r\ndigestion and swallowed. Fig. 7 represents the mouth parts of the humble\r\nbee. (_b_, upper lip; _d_, mandible; _e_, maxilla; _f_, maxillary\r\npalpus; _g_, tongue; _ih_, labium and tabial palpi; _k_, eye.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7. Mouth parts of a Humble Bee.]\r\n\r\nThe alimentary canal passes through the middle of the body, the stomach\r\nforming usually a simple enlargement. Just before the stomach in certain\r\ninsects, as the grasshopper, is a gizzard armed with rows of powerful\r\nhorny teeth for finely crushing grass.\r\n\r\nInsects eat almost incredible quantities of food when young and growing\r\nrapidly. Mr. Trouvelot tells us in the "American Naturalist" that the\r\nfood taken by a single American Silk-worm in fifty-six days is equal to\r\neighty-six thousand times its primitive weight! On the other hand, after\r\nthe insect has finished its transformations, it either takes no food at\r\nall, as in the May fly, or merely sips the honey of flowers, as in the\r\nbutterfly, while the June beetle and many others like it eat the leaves\r\nof trees, and the tiger and ground beetles feed voraciously on other\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n_How Insects Walk._ In man and his allies, the vertebrates, the process\r\nof walking is a most difficult and apparently dangerous feat. To\r\ndescribe the mechanics of walking, the wonderful adaptation of the\r\nmuscles and bones for the performance of this most ordinary action of\r\nlife, would require a volume. The process is scarcely less complex in\r\ninsects. Lyonnet found 3,993 muscles in a caterpillar, and while a large\r\nproportion belong to the internal organs, over a thousand assist in\r\nlocomotion. Hence the muscular power of insects is enormous. A flea will\r\nleap two hundred times its own height, and certain large, solid beetles\r\nwill move enormous weights as compared to the bulk of their bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8. Larva of a beetle (Photuris).]\r\n\r\nIn walking, as seen in the accompanying figure (Fig. 8), three legs are\r\nthrown forward at a time, two on one side and one on the other.\r\n\r\nFlies and many other insects can walk upside down, or on glass, as\r\neasily as on a level surface. A fly\'s foot, as in most other insects,\r\nconsists of five joints (tarsal joints), to the last one of which is\r\nappended a pair of stout claws, beneath which is a flat, soft, fleshy\r\ncushion or pad, split into two (sometimes three) flaps, beset on the\r\nunder surface with fine hairs. A part of these hairs are swollen at the\r\nend, which is covered with "an elastic membranous expansion, capable of\r\nclose contact with a highly polished surface, from which a minute\r\nquantity of a clear, transparent fluid is emitted when the fly is\r\nactively moving." (T. West.) These hairs are hence called holding, or\r\ntenent, hairs. With the aid of these, but mainly, as Mr. West insists,\r\nby the pressure of the atmosphere, a fly is enabled to adhere to\r\nperfectly smooth surfaces. His studies show the following curious facts.\r\n"That atmospheric pressure, if the area of the flaps be alone\r\nconsidered, is equal to just one-half the weight of a fly. If the area\r\ncovered by the tenent hairs be added, an increase of pressure is gained,\r\nequal to about one-fourth the weight of a fly. This leaves one-fourth to\r\nbe accounted for by slight viscidity of the fluid, by the action I have\r\nso often alluded to, which may be called \'grasping,\' by molecular\r\nattraction, and, doubtless, by other agents still more subtle, with\r\nwhich we have at present scarcely any acquaintance."\r\n\r\n_How Insects Fly._ Who of us, as remarked by an eminent ornithologist,\r\ncan even now explain the long sustained, peculiar flight of the hawk, or\r\nturkey buzzard, as it sails in the air without changing the position of\r\nits wings? and, we would add, the somewhat similar flight of a\r\nbutterfly? It is the poetry of motion, and a marvellous exhibition of\r\ngrace and ease, combined with a wonderful underlying strength and\r\nlightness of the parts concerned in flight.\r\n\r\nBefore we give a partial account of the results obtained by the delicate\r\nexperiments of Professor Marey on the flight of birds and insects, our\r\nreaders should be reminded of the great differences between an insect\r\nand a bird, remembering that the former, is, in brief, a chitinous sac,\r\nso to speak, or rather a series of three such spherical or elliptical\r\nsacs (the head, thorax and abdomen); the outer walls of the body forming\r\na solid but light crust, to which are attached broad, membranous wings,\r\nthe wing being a sort of membranous bag stretched over a framework of\r\nhollow tubes (the trache\xc3\xa6), so disposed as to give the greatest\r\nlightness and strength to the wing. The wings are moved by powerful\r\nmuscles of flight, filling up the cavity of the thorax, just as the\r\nmuscles are the largest about the thorax of a bird. Moreover in the\r\nbodies of insects that fly (such as the bee, cockchafer, and dragon\r\nfly), as distinguished from those that creep exclusively, the air tubes\r\n(trache\xc3\xa6) which ramify into every part of the body, are dilated here and\r\nthere, especially in the base of the abdomen, into large sacs, which are\r\nfilled with air when the insect is about to take flight, so that the\r\nspecific gravity of the body is greatly diminished. Indeed, these air\r\nsacs, dilatable at will by the insect, may be compared to the swimming\r\nbladder of fishes, which enables them to rise and fall at will to\r\ndifferent levels in the sea, thus effecting an immense saving of the\r\nlabor of swimming. In the birds, as every body knows who has eaten a\r\nchicken, or attended the dissection of a Thanksgiving turkey, the soft\r\nparts are external, attached to the bony framework comprising the\r\nskeleton, the wing bones being directly connected with the central back\r\nbone; so that while these two sorts of animated flying machines are so\r\ndifferent in structure, they yet act in much the same manner when on the\r\nwing. The difference between them is clearly stated by Marey, some of\r\nwhose conclusions we now give almost word for word.\r\n\r\nThe flight of butterflies and moths differs from that of birds in the\r\nalmost vertical direction of the stroke of their wings, and in their\r\nfaculty of sailing in the air without making any movements; though\r\nsometimes in the course they pursue they seem to resemble birds in their\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nThe flight of insects and birds moreover differs in the form of the\r\ntrajectory in space; in the inclination of the plane in which the wings\r\nbeat; in the role of each of the two alternating (and in an inverse\r\nsense) movements that the wings execute; as also in the facility with\r\nwhich the air is decomposed during these different movements. As the\r\nwings of a fly are adorned with a brilliant array of colors, we can\r\nfollow the trajectory or figure that each wing writes in the air. It is\r\nof the form of a figure of eight (Fig. 9), first discovered by Professor\r\nJ. Bell Pettigrew of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 9. Figure cut by an insect\'s wing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 10. Figure cut by a bird\'s wing.]\r\n\r\nBy an ingenious machine, specially devised for the purpose, Professor\r\nMarey found that a bird\'s wing moves in an ellipse, with a pointed\r\nsummit (Fig. 10). The insect beats the air in a distinctly horizontal\r\nplane, but the bird in a vertical plane. The wing of an insect is\r\nimpervious to the air; while the bird\'s wing resists the air only on\r\nits under side. Hence, there are two sorts of effects; in the insect\r\nthe up and down strokes are active; in the bird, the lowering of the\r\nwing is the only active period, though the return stroke seems to\r\nsustain the bird, the air acting on the wing. The bird\'s body is\r\nhorizontal when the wing gives a downward stroke; but when the beat is\r\nupward, the bird is placed in an inclined plane like a winged\r\nprojectile, and mounts up on the air by means of the inclined surfaces\r\nthat it passively offers to the resistance of this fluid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 11. Trajectory of an insect\'s wing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 12. Trajectory of a bird\'s wing.]\r\n\r\nIn an insect, an energetic movement is equally necessary to strike the\r\nair at both beats up and down. In the bird, on the contrary, one active\r\nbeat only is necessary, the down beat. It creates at that time all the\r\nmotive force that will be dispensed during the entire revolution of the\r\nwing. This difference is due to the difference in form of the wing. The\r\ndifference between the two forms of flight is shown by an inspection of\r\nthe two accompanying figures (11, 12). An insect\'s wing is small at the\r\nbase and broad at the end. This breadth would be useless near the body,\r\nbecause at this point the wing does not move swiftly enough to strike\r\nthe air effectively. The type of the insectean wing is designed, then,\r\nsimply to strike the air. But in the bird the wing plays also a passive\r\nrole, _i. e._, it receives the pressure of the air on its under side\r\nwhen the bird is projected rapidly onward by its acquired swiftness. In\r\nthese conditions the whole animal is carried onward in space; all the\r\npoints of its wing have the same velocity. The neighboring regions of\r\nthe body are useful to press upon the air, which acts as on a paper\r\nkite. The base of the wing also, in the bird, is broad, and provided\r\nwith feathers, which form a broad surface, on which the air presses with\r\na force and method very efficacious in supporting the bird. Fig. 12\r\ngives an idea of this disposition of the wing at the active and passive\r\ntime in a bird.\r\n\r\nThe inner half of the wing is the passive part of the organ, while the\r\nexternal half, that which strikes the air, is the active part. A fly\'s\r\nwing makes 330 revolutions in a second, executing consequently 660\r\nsimple oscillations; it ought at each time to impress a lateral\r\ndeviation of the body of the insect, and destroy the velocity that the\r\npreceding oscillation has given it in a contrary direction. So that by\r\nthis hypothesis the insect in its flight only utilizes fifty to one\r\nhundred parts (or one-half) of the resistance that the air furnishes it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 13. A bird on the wing.]\r\n\r\nIn the bird (Fig. 13), at the time of lowering the wings, the oblique\r\nplane which strikes the air, in decomposing the resistance, produces a\r\nvertical component which resists the weight of the body, and a\r\nhorizontal component which imparts swiftness. The horizontal component\r\nis not lost, but is utilized during the rise of the wing, as in a paper\r\nkite when held in the air against the wind. Thus the bird utilizes\r\nseventy-five out of one hundred parts of the resistance that the air\r\nfurnishes. The style of flight of birds is, therefore, theoretically\r\nsuperior to that of insects. As to the division of the muscular force\r\nbetween the resistance of the air and the mass of the body of the bird,\r\nwe should compare the exertion made in walking on sand, for example, as\r\ncompared with walking on marble. This is easy to measure. When a fish\r\nstrikes the water with its tail to propel itself forward, it performs a\r\ndouble task; one part consists in pushing backwards a certain mass of\r\nwater with a certain swiftness, and the other in pushing on the body in\r\nspite of the resistance of the surrounding fluid. This last portion of\r\nthe task only is utilized. It would be greater if the tail of the fish\r\nencountered a solid object. Almost all the propelling agencies employed\r\nin navigation undergo this loss of labor, which depends on the mobility\r\nof the _point d\' appui_. The bird is placed among conditions especially\r\nunfavorable.\r\n\r\n_The Senses of Insects._ The eyes of insects are sometimes so large as\r\nto envelop the head like an Elizabethan ruffle, and the creature\'s head,\r\nas in the common house fly, seems all eyes. And this is almost literally\r\nthe case, as the two great staring eyes that almost meet on the top of\r\nthe head to form one, are made up of myriads of simple eyes. Each facet\r\nor simple eye is provided with a nerve filament which branches off from\r\nthe main optic nerve, so that but one impression of the object perceived\r\nis conveyed to the brain; though it is taught by some that objects\r\nappear not only double but a thousand times multiplied. But we should\r\nremember that with our two eyes we see double only when the brain is\r\ndiseased. Besides the large ordinary compound eyes, many insects possess\r\nsmall, simple eyes, like those of the spider. The great German\r\nanatomist, Johannes M\xc3\xbcller, believed that the compound eyes were adapted\r\nfor the perception of distant objects, while those nearer are seen by\r\nthe simple eyes. But it may be objected to this view that the spiders,\r\nwhich have only simple eyes, apparently see both near and remote objects\r\nas well as insects.\r\n\r\nThe sense of touch is diffused all over the body. As in the hairs of the\r\nhead and face of man, those of insects are delicate tactile organs; and\r\non the antenn\xc3\xa6 and legs (insects depending on this sense rather than\r\nthat of sight) these appendages are covered with exquisitely fine\r\nhairs. It is thought by some that the senses of hearing and smell are\r\nlodged in the antenn\xc3\xa6, these organs thus combining the sense of feeling\r\nwith those of hearing and smelling. And the researches of anatomists\r\nlend much probability to the assertion, since little pits just under the\r\nskin are found, and even sometimes provided with grains of sand in the\r\nso-called ear of the lobster, etc., corresponding to the ear bones of\r\nthe higher animals, the pits being connected with nerves leading to the\r\nbrain. We have detected similar pits in the under side of the palpi of\r\nthe Perla. It seems not improbable that these are organs of smell, and\r\nplaced in that part of the appendage nearest the mouth, so as to enable\r\nthe insect to select its proper food by its odor. Similar organs exist\r\non the caudal appendages of a kind of fly (Chrysopila), while the long,\r\nmany-jointed caudal filaments of the cockroach are each provided with\r\nnearly a hundred of these little pits, which seem to be so many noses.\r\nThus Lesp\xc3\xa8s, a Swiss anatomist, in his remarks on the auditory sacs,\r\nwhich he says are found in the antenn\xc3\xa6 of nearly all insects, declares\r\nthat as we have in insects compound eyes, so we have compound ears. We\r\nmight add that in the abdominal appendage of the cockroach we have a\r\ncompound nose, while in the feelers of the Perla, and the caudal\r\nappendage of the Chrysopila, the "nose" is simple. We might also refer\r\nhere to Siebold\'s discovery of ears at the base of the abdomen of some,\r\nand in the forelegs of other kinds, of grasshoppers. Thus we need not be\r\nsurprised at finding ears and noses scattered, as it were, sometimes\r\nalmost wantonly over the bodies of insects (in many worms the eyes are\r\nfound all over the body), while in man and his allies, from the monkey\r\ndown to the fish, the ears and nose invariably retain the same relative\r\nplace in the head.\r\n\r\n_How Insects Grow._ When beginning our entomological studies no fact\r\nseemed more astonishing to our boyish mind than the thought that the\r\nlittle flies and midges were not the sons and daughters of the big\r\nones. If every farmer and gardener knew this single fact it would be\r\nworth their while. The words _larva_ and _pupa_ will frequently occur in\r\nsubsequent pages, and they should be explained. The caterpillar (Fig.\r\n14, _a_) represents the earliest stage or babyhood of the butterfly, and\r\nit is called _larva_, from the Latin, meaning a mask, because it was\r\nthought by the ancients to mask the form of the adult butterfly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 14. _a_ Larva, _b_ chrysalis of a butterfly.]\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillar has ended its riotous life, for its appetite almost\r\ntransforms its being into the very incarnation of gluttony, it suddenly,\r\nas if repenting of its former life as a _bon vivant_, seeks a solitary\r\ncell or hole where like a hermit it sits and leads apparently about as\r\nuseless an existence. But meanwhile strange processes are going on\r\nbeneath the skin; and after a few convulsive struggles the back splits\r\nopen, and out wriggles the chrysalis, a gorgeous, mummy-like form, its\r\nbody adorned with golden and silvery spots. Hence the word chrysalis\r\n(Fig. 14, _b_), from the Greek, meaning golden, while the Latin word\r\n_pupa_, meaning a baby or doll, is indicative of its youth. In this\r\nstate it hangs suspended to a twig or other object; while the silk worm,\r\nand others of its kind, previous to moulting, or casting their skins,\r\nspin a silken cocoon, which envelops and protects the chrysalis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15. Imago or adult Butterfly.]\r\n\r\nAt the given time, and after the body of the adult has fully formed\r\nbeneath the chrysalis skin, there is another moult, and the butterfly,\r\nwith baggy, wet wings, creeps out. The body dries, the skin hardens, the\r\nwings expand, and in a few moments, sometimes an hour, the butterfly\r\n(Fig. 15) proudly sails aloft, the glory and pride of the insect world.\r\n\r\nWe shall see in the ensuing chapters how varied are the larv\xc3\xa6 and pup\xc3\xa6\r\nof insects, and under what different guises insects live in their early\r\nstages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Larva, pupa, and adult of a Leaf Beetle (Galeruca).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR COMMON INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE HOME OF THE BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Honey bee, its wonderful instincts, its elaborate\r\ncells and complex economy, have engrossed the attention of the best\r\nobservers, even from the time of Virgil, who sang of the Ligurian bee.\r\nThe literature of the art of bee-keeping is already very extensive.\r\nNumerous bee journals and manuals of bee-keeping testify to the\r\nimportance of this art, while able mathematicians have studied the mode\r\nof formation of the hexagonal cells,[1] and physiologists have\r\ninvestigated the intricate problems of the mode of generation and\r\ndevelopment of the bee itself.\r\n\r\nIn discussing these difficult questions, we must rise from the study of\r\nthe simple to the complex, remembering that--\r\n\r\n  "All nature widens upward. Evermore\r\n  The simpler essence lower lies:\r\n  More complex is more perfect--owning more\r\n  Discourse, more widely wise."\r\n\r\nand not forget to study the humbler allies of the Honey bee. We shall,\r\nin observing the habits and homes of the wild bees, gain a clearer\r\ninsight into the mysteries of the hive.\r\n\r\nThe great family of bees is divided into social and solitary species.\r\nThe social kinds live in nests composed of numerous cells in which the\r\nyoung brood are reared. These cells vary in form from those which are\r\nquite regularly hexagonal, like those of the Hive bee, to those which\r\nare less regularly six-sided, as in the stingless bee of the tropics\r\n(Melipona), until in the Humble bee the cells are isolated and\r\ncylindrical in form.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the wild bees, let us briefly review the life of the\r\nHoney bee. The queen bee having wintered over with many workers, lays\r\nher eggs in the spring, first in the worker, and, at a later period, in\r\nthe drone-cells. Early in the summer the workers construct the large,\r\nflask-shaped queen-cells, which are placed on the edge of the comb, and\r\nin these the queen larv\xc3\xa6 are fed with rich and choice food. The old\r\nqueen deserts the nest, forming a new colony. The new-born queen takes\r\nher marriage flight high in the air with a drone, and on her return\r\nundertakes the management of the hive, and the duty of laying eggs. When\r\nthe supply of queens is exhausted, the workers destroy the drones. The\r\nfirst brood of workers live about six weeks in summer, and then give way\r\nto a new brood. The queens, according to Von Berlepsch, are known to\r\nlive five years, and during their whole life lay more than a million\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nIn the tropics, the Honey bee is replaced by the Meliponas and Trigonas.\r\nThey are minute, stingless bees, which store up honey and live in\r\ncolonies often of immense extent. The cells of Melipona are hexagonal,\r\nnearly approaching in regularity those of the Hive bee, while the honey\r\ncells are irregular, being much larger cavities, which hold about\r\none-half as much honey as a cell of the Humble bee. "Gardner, in his\r\ntravels, states that many species of Melipona build in the hollow trunks\r\nof trees, others in banks; some suspend their nests from the branches of\r\ntrees, whilst one species constructs its nest of clay, it being of large\r\nsize." (F. Smith.)\r\n\r\nIn a nest of the coal-black Trigona (Trigona carbonaria), from eastern\r\nAustralia, Mr. F. Smith, of the British Museum, found from four hundred\r\nto five hundred dead workers, but no females. The combs were arranged\r\nprecisely similar to those of the common wasp. The number of honey-pots\r\nwhich were placed at the foot of the nest was two hundred and fifty. Mr.\r\nSmith inclines to the opinion that the hive of Trigona contains several\r\nprolific females, as the great number of workers can only be thus\r\nexplained, and M. Gu\xc3\xa9rin found six females in a nest of the Tawny-footed\r\nMelipona (M. fulvipes).\r\n\r\nAt home, our nearest ally of the true Honey bee, is the Humble bee\r\n(Bombus), of which over forty species are known to inhabit North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe economy of the Humble bee is thus: the queen awakens in early spring\r\nfrom her winter\'s sleep under leaves or moss, or in the last year\'s\r\nnest, and selects a nesting place, generally in an abandoned nest of a\r\nfield-mouse, or beneath a stump or sod, and "immediately," according to\r\nMr. F. W. Putnam,[2] "collects" a small amount of pollen mixed with\r\nhoney, and in this deposits from seven to fourteen eggs, gradually\r\nadding to the pollen mass until the first brood is hatched. She does not\r\nwait, however, for one brood to be hatched before laying the eggs of\r\nanother, but, as soon as food enough has been collected, she lays the\r\neggs for a second. The eggs are laid, in contact with each other, in one\r\ncavity of the mass of pollen, with a part of which they are slightly\r\ncovered. They are very soon developed; in fact, the lines are nowhere\r\ndistinctly drawn between the egg and the larva, the larva and pupa, and\r\nagain between the latter and the imago; a perfect series, showing this\r\ngradual transformation of the young to the imago can be found in almost\r\nevery nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15. Cell and Eggs of Bombus.]\r\n\r\n"As soon as the larv\xc3\xa6 are capable of motion and commence feeding, they\r\neat the pollen by which they are surrounded, and, gradually separating,\r\npush their way in various directions. Eating as they move, and\r\nincreasing in size quite rapidly, they soon make large cavities in the\r\npollen mass. When they have attained their full size, they spin a silken\r\nwall about them, which is strengthened by the old bees covering it with\r\na thin layer of wax, which soon becomes hard and tough, thus forming a\r\ncell (Fig. 15, 1, cell containing a larva, on top of which (2) is a\r\npollen mass containing three eggs). The larv\xc3\xa6 now gradually attain the\r\npupa stage, and remain inactive until their full development. They then\r\ncut their way out, and are ready to assume their duties as workers,\r\nsmall females, males or queens.\r\n\r\n"It is apparent that the irregular disposition of the cells is due to\r\ntheir being constructed so peculiarly by the larv\xc3\xa6. After the first\r\nbrood, composed of workers, has come forth, the queen bee devotes her\r\ntime principally to her duties at home, the workers supplying the colony\r\nwith honey and pollen. As the queen continues prolific, more workers are\r\nadded, and the nest is rapidly enlarged.\r\n\r\n"About the middle of summer, eggs are deposited, which produce both\r\nsmall females and males." ... "All eggs laid after the last of July\r\nproduce the large females, or queens, and, the males being still in the\r\nnest, it is presumed that the queens are impregnated at this time, as on\r\nthe approach of cold weather all except the queens, of which there are\r\nseveral in each nest, die."\r\n\r\nWhile the Humble bee in some respects shows much less instinct than the\r\nsolitary bees mentioned below, it stands higher in the series, however,\r\nfrom having workers, as well as males and females, who provide food for\r\nthe young. The labors of the Mason bees, and their allies, terminate\r\nafter the cell is once constructed and filled with pollen. The eggs are\r\nthen left to hatch, and the young care for themselves, though the adult\r\nbee shows greater skill in architecture than the Humble bee. It is thus\r\nthroughout nature. Many forms, comparatively low in the scale of life,\r\nastonish us with certain characters or traits, reminding us of beings\r\nmuch superior, physically and intellectually. The lower forms constantly\r\nreach up and in some way ally themselves with creatures far more highly\r\norganized. Thus the fish-like seal reminds us strikingly of the dog,\r\nboth in the form of the head, in its docility and great intelligence\r\nwhen tamed, and even in its bark and the movements of the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 16. Melo\xc3\xab.]\r\n\r\nThe parasites of the Humble bee are numerous. Such are the species of\r\nApathus, which so closely resembles the Humble bee itself, that it\r\nrequires long study to distinguish it readily. Its habits are not known,\r\nother than that it is found in the nests of its host. It differs from\r\nthe Humble bee in having no pollen-basket, showing that its larv\xc3\xa6 must\r\nfeed on the food stored up by their host, as it does not itself collect\r\nit. The mandibles also are not, like those of Bombus, trowel-shaped for\r\narchitectural purposes, but acutely triangular, and are probably not\r\nused in building.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of various moths consume the honey and waxen cells; the\r\ntwo-winged flies, Volucella and Conops, and the larv\xc3\xa6 of what is either\r\nan Anthomyia or Tachina-like fly, and several species of another genus\r\nof flies, Anthrax, together with several beetles, such as the Melo\xc3\xab\r\n(Fig. 16), Stylops (Fig. 17, male; 18_b_, female; _a_, position in the\r\nbody of its host), and Antherophagus prey upon them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 17. Male Stylops.]\r\n\r\nThe power of boring the most symmetrical tunnels in solid wood reaches\r\nits perfection in the large Virginian Carpenter bee (Xylocopa Virginica,\r\nFig. 19). This bee is as large as, and some allied exotic species are\r\noften considerably larger than, the Humble bee, but not clothed with\r\nsuch dense hairs. We have received from Mr. James Angus, of West Farms,\r\nN. Y., a piece of trellis from a grape vine, made of pine wood,\r\ncontaining the cells and young in various stages of growth, together\r\nwith the larv\xc3\xa6 and chrysalids of Anthrax sinuosa (Fig. 20), a species of\r\nfly parasitic on the larva. The maggot buries its head in the soft body\r\nof the young bee and feeds on its juices.\r\n\r\nMr. Angus thus writes us regarding its habits, under date of July 19: "I\r\nasked an intelligent and observing carpenter yesterday, if he knew how\r\nlong it took the Xylocopa to bore her tunnel. He said he thought she\r\nbored about one-quarter of an inch a day. I don\'t think myself she\r\nbores more than one-half inch, if she does that. If I mistake not, it\r\ntakes her about two days to make her own length at the first start; but\r\nthis being across the grain of the wood, may not be so easily done as\r\nthe remainder, which runs parallel with it. She always follows the grain\r\nof the wood, with the exception of the entrance, which is about her own\r\nlength. The tunnels run from one to one and a half feet in length. They\r\ngenerally run in opposite directions from the opening, and sometimes\r\nother galleries are run, one directly above the other, using the same\r\nopening. I think they only make new tunnels when old ones are not to be\r\nfound, and that the same tunnels are used for many years. Some of the\r\nold tunnels are very wide. I have found parts of them about an inch in\r\ndiameter. I think this is caused by rasping off the sides to procure the\r\nnecessary material for constructing their cells. The partitions are\r\ncomposed of wood raspings, and some sticky fluid, probably saliva, to\r\nmake them adhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 18. Female Stylops.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 19. Carpenter Bee.]\r\n\r\n"The tunnels are sometimes taken possession of by other bees and wasps.\r\nI think when this is the case, the Xylocopa prefers making a new cell,\r\nto cleaning out the dirt and rubbish of the other species. I frequently\r\nfind these bees remaining for a long time on the wing close to the\r\nopening, and bobbing their heads against the side, as if fanning air\r\ninto the opening. I have seen them thus employed for twenty minutes.\r\nWhether one bee or more makes the tunnel, that is, whether they take\r\nturns in boring, I cannot at present say. In opening the cells (Fig.\r\n21), more than one are generally found, even at this season. About two\r\nweeks ago; I found as many as seven, I think, in one."[3]\r\n\r\nThe hole is divided by partitions into cells about seven-tenths of an\r\ninch long. These partitions are constructed of the coarse dust or\r\nchippings made by the bee in eating out her cells, for our active little\r\ncarpenter is provided with strong cutting jaws, moved by powerful\r\nmuscles, and on her legs are stiff brushes of hair for cleaning out the\r\ntunnel as she descends into the heart of the solid wood. She must throw\r\nout the chips she bites off with her powerful mandibles from the sides\r\nof the burrow, by means of her hind legs, passing the load of chips\r\nbackwards out of the cell with her fore limbs, which she uses as hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 20. Larva and Pupa of Anthrax.]\r\n\r\nThe partitions are built most elaborately of a single flattened band of\r\nchips, which is rolled up into a coil four layers deep. One side,\r\nforming the bottom of the cell, is concave, being beaten down and\r\nsmoothed off by the bee. The other side of the partition, forming the\r\ntop of the cell, is flat and rough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 21. Nest of Carpenter Bee.]\r\n\r\nAt the time of opening the burrow, July 8th, the cells contained nearly\r\nfull-grown larv\xc3\xa6, with some half developed. They were feeding on the\r\nmasses of pollen, which were as large as a thick kidney bean, and\r\noccupied nearly half the cell. The larv\xc3\xa6 (Fig. 21) resemble those of the\r\nHumble bee, but are slenderer, tapering more rapidly towards each end of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nThe habits and structure of the little green Ceratina ally it closely\r\nwith Xylocopa. This pretty bee, named Ceratina dupla by Mr. Say, tunnels\r\nout the stems of the elder or blackberry, syringa, or any pithy shrub,\r\nexcavating them often to a depth of six or seven inches. She makes the\r\nwalls just wide enough to admit her body, and of a depth capable of\r\nholding three or four, often five or six cells (Fig. 22). The finely\r\nbuilt cells, with their delicate silken walls, are cylindrical and\r\nnearly square at each end, though the free end of the last cell is\r\nrounded off. They are four and a half tenths of an inch long, and a\r\nlittle over one-third as broad. The bee places them at nearly equal\r\ndistances apart, the slight interval between them being filled in with\r\ndirt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 22. Nest of Ceratina.]\r\n\r\nDr. T. W. Harris states that May 15, 1832, one female laid its eggs in\r\nthe hollow of an aster stalk. Three perfect insects were disclosed from\r\nit July 28th. The observations of Mr. Angus, who saw some bees making\r\ntheir cells May 18th, also confirm this account. The history of our\r\nlittle upholsterer is thus cleared up. Late in the spring she builds her\r\ncells, fills them with pollen, and lays one or more eggs upon each mass.\r\nThus in about two months the insect completes its transformations;\r\nwithin this period passing through the egg, the larva and chrysalid\r\nstates, and then, as a bee, living a few days more, if a male; or if a\r\nfemale, living through the winter. Her life thus spans one year.\r\n\r\nThe larva (Fig. 23) is longer than that of Megachile, and compared with\r\nthat of Xylocopa, the different segments are much more convex, giving a\r\nserrate outline to the back of the worm. The pupa, or chrysalis, we have\r\nfound in the cells the last of July. It is white, and three-tenths of an\r\ninch long. It differs from that of the Leaf-cutter bee in having four\r\nspines on the end of the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 23. Larva of Ceratina.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 24. Nest of Tailor Bee.]\r\n\r\nIn none of the wild bees are the cells constructed with more nicety than\r\nthose of our little Ceratina. She bores out with her jaws a long deep\r\nwell just the size of her body, and then stretches a thin, delicate\r\ncloth of silk drawn tight as a drum-head across each end of her\r\nchambers, which she then fills with a mixture of pollen and honey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 25. Tailor Bee.]\r\n\r\nHer young are not, in this supposed retreat, entirely free from danger.\r\nThe most invidious foes enter and attack the brood. Three species of\r\nIchneumon flies, two of which belong to the Chalcid family, lay their\r\neggs within the body of the larva, and emerge from the dried larva and\r\npupa skins of the bee, often in great numbers. The smallest parasite,\r\nbelonging to the genus Anthophorabia, so called from being first known\r\nas a parasite on another bee (Anthophora), is a minute species found\r\nalso abundantly in the tight cells of the Leaf-cutter bee.\r\n\r\nThe interesting habits of the Leaf-cutting, or Tailor bee (Megachile),\r\nhave always attracted attention. This bee is a stout, thick-bodied\r\ninsect, with a large, square head, stout, sharp, scissors-like jaws, and\r\nwith a thick mass of stout, dense hairs on the under side of the tail\r\nfor carrying pollen, as she is not provided with the pollen-basket of\r\nthe Honey and Humble bees.\r\n\r\nThe Megachile lays its eggs in burrows in the stems of the elder (Fig.\r\n24), which we have received from Mr. James Angus; we have also found\r\nthem in the hollows of the locust tree. Mr. F. W. Putnam thus speaks of\r\nthe economy of M. centuncularis, our most common species. "My attention\r\nwas first called, on the 26th of June, to a female busily engaged in\r\nbringing pieces of leaf to her cells, which she was building under a\r\nboard, on the roof of the piazza, directly under my window. Nearly the\r\nwhole morning was occupied by the bee in bringing pieces of leaf from a\r\nrose bush growing about ten yards from her cells, returning at intervals\r\nof a half minute to a minute with the pieces, which she carried in such\r\na manner as not to impede her steps when she alighted near her hole."\r\nWhen the Leaf-cutter bee wishes to cut out a piece of a leaf (Fig. 25)\r\nshe alights upon the leaf, and in a few seconds swiftly runs her\r\nscissors-like jaws around through it, bearing off the piece in her hind\r\nlegs. "About noon she had probably completed the cell, upon which she\r\nhad been engaged, as, during the afternoon, she was occupied in bringing\r\npollen, preparatory to laying her single egg in the cell. For about\r\ntwenty days the bee continued at work, building new cells and supplying\r\nthem with pollen.... On the 28th of July, upon removing the board, it\r\nwas found that the bee had made thirty cells, arranged in nine rows of\r\nunequal length, some being slightly curved to adapt them to the space\r\nunder the board. The longest row contained six cells, and was two and,\r\nthree-quarters inches in length; the whole leaf structure being equal to\r\na length of fifteen inches. Upon making an estimate of the pieces of\r\nleaf in this structure, it was ascertained that there must have been at\r\nleast a thousand pieces used. In addition to the labor of making the\r\ncells, this bee, unassisted in all her duties, had to collect the\r\nrequisite amount of pollen (and honey?) for each cell, and lay her eggs\r\ntherein, when completed. Upon carefully cutting out a portion of one of\r\nthe cells, a full-grown larva was seen engaged in spinning a slight\r\nsilken cocoon about the walls of its prison, which were quite hard and\r\nsmooth on the inside, probably owing to the movements of the larva, and\r\nthe consequent pressing of the sticky particles to the walls. In a short\r\ntime the opening made was closed over by a very thin silken web. The\r\ncells, measured on the inside of the hard walls, were .35 of an inch in\r\nlength, and .15 in diameter. The natural attitude of the larva is\r\nsomewhat curved in its cell, but if straightened, it just equals the\r\ninside length of the cell. On the 31st of July, two female bees came\r\nout, having cut their way through the sides of their cells." In three\r\nother cells "several hundred minute Ichneumons (Anthophorabia\r\nmegachilis) were seen, which came forth as soon as the cells were\r\nopened."\r\n\r\nThe habits of the little blue or green Mason bees (Osmia) are quite\r\nvaried. They construct their cells in the stems of plants, and in rotten\r\nposts and trees, or, like Andrena, they burrow in sunny banks. A\r\nEuropean species selects snail shells for its nest, wherein it builds\r\nits earthen cells, while other species nidificate under stones. Curtis\r\nfound two hundred and thirty cocoons of a British species (Osmia\r\nparetina), placed on the under side of a flat stone, of which one-third\r\nwere empty. Of the remainder, the most appeared between March and June,\r\nmales appearing first; thirty-five more bees were developed the\r\nfollowing spring. Thus there were three successive broods, for three\r\nsucceeding years, so that these bees lived three years before arriving\r\nat maturity. This may partly account for _insect years_, which are like\r\n"apple years," seasons when bees and wasps, as well as other insects,\r\nabound in unusual numbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 26. Nest of Osmia.]\r\n\r\nMr. G. R. Waterhouse, in the Transactions of the Entomological Society\r\nof London, for 1864, states that the cells of Osmia leucomelana "are\r\nformed of mud, and each cell is built separately. The female bee,\r\nhaving deposited a small pellet of mud in a sheltered spot between some\r\ntufts of grass, immediately begins to excavate a small cavity in its\r\nupper surface, scraping the mud away from the centre towards the margin\r\nby means of her jaws. A small, shallow mud-cup is thus produced. It is\r\nrough and uneven on the outer surface, but beautifully smooth on the\r\ninner. On witnessing thus much of the work performed, I was struck with\r\nthree points: first, the rapidity with which the insect worked;\r\nsecondly, the tenacity with which she kept her original position whilst\r\nexcavating; and thirdly, her constantly going over work which had\r\napparently been completed.... The lid is excavated and rendered concave\r\non its outer or upper surface, and is convex and rough on its inner\r\nsurface; and, in fact, is a simple repetition of the first-formed\r\nportion of the cell, a part of a hollow sphere."\r\n\r\nThe largest species of Osmia known to us is a very dark-blue species (O.\r\nlignivora). We are indebted to a lady for specimens of the bees with\r\ntheir cells, which had been excavated in the interior of a maple tree\r\nseveral inches from the bark. The bee had industriously tunnelled out\r\nthis elaborate burrow (Fig. 26), and, in this respect, resembled the\r\nhabits of the Carpenter bee more closely than any other species of its\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\nThe tunnel was over three inches long, and about three-tenths of an inch\r\nwide. It contracted a little in width between the cell, showing that the\r\nbee worked intelligently, and wasted no more of her energies than was\r\nabsolutely necessary. The burrow contained five cells, each half an inch\r\nlong, being rather short and broad, with the hinder end rounded, while\r\nthe opposite end, next to the one adjoining, is cut off squarely. The\r\ncell is somewhat jug-shaped, owing to a slight constriction just behind\r\nthe mouth. The material of which the cell is composed is stout, silken,\r\nparchment-like, and very smooth within. The interstices between the\r\ncells are filled in with rather coarse chippings made by the bee.\r\n\r\nThe bee cut its way out of the cells in March, and lived for a month\r\nafterwards on a diet of honey and water. It eagerly lapped up the drops\r\nof water supplied by its keeper, to whom it soon grew accustomed, and\r\nseemed to recognize.\r\n\r\nOur smallest and most abundant species is the little green Osmia\r\nsimillima. It builds its little oval, somewhat urn-shaped cells against\r\nthe roof of the large deserted galls of the oak-gall fly (Diplolepis\r\nconfluentus), placing them, in this instance eleven in number, in two\r\nirregular rows, from which the mature bees issue through a hole in the\r\ngall (Fig. 27, with two separate cells). The earthen cells, containing\r\nthe tough dense cocoons, were arranged irregularly so as to fit the\r\nconcave vault of the larger gall, which was about two inches in\r\ndiameter. On emerging from the cell the Osmia cuts out with its powerful\r\njaws an ovate lid, nearly as large as one side of the cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 27. Nest of Osmia in a gall.]\r\n\r\nIn the Harris collection are the cells and specimens of Osmia pacifica,\r\nthe peaceful Osmia, which, according to the manuscript notes of Dr.\r\nHarris, is found in the perfect state in earthen cells beneath stones.\r\nThe cell is oval cylindrical, a little contracted as usual with those of\r\nall the species of the genus, thus forming an urn-shaped cell. It is\r\nhalf an inch long, and nearly three-tenths of an inch wide, while the\r\ncocoon, which is rather thin, is three-tenths of an inch long. We are\r\nnot acquainted with the habits of the larva and pupa in this country,\r\nbut Mr. F. Smith states that the larva of the English species hatches in\r\neight days after the eggs are laid, feeds ten to twelve days, when it\r\nbecomes full-grown, then spins a thin silken covering, and remains in an\r\ninactive state until the following spring, when it completes its\r\ntransformations.\r\n\r\nIn the economy of our wild bees we see the manifestation of a wonderful\r\ninstinct, as well as the exhibition of a _limited reason_. We can\r\nscarcely deny to animals a kind of reason which apparently differs _only\r\nin degree_ from that of man. Each species works in a sphere limited by\r\nphysical laws, but within that sphere it is a free agent. They have\r\nenough of instinct and reason to direct their lives, and to enable them\r\nto act their part in carrying out the plan of creation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paper Wasp.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The cells are not perfectly hexagonal. See the studies on\r\nthe formation of the cells of the bee, by Professor J. Wyman, in the\r\nProceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Boston, 1866;\r\nand the author\'s Guide to the Study of Insects, p 123.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Notes on the Habits of the Humble Bee (Proceedings of the\r\nEssex Institute, vol. iv, 1864, p. 101).\r\n\r\nMr. Angus also writes us as follows concerning the habits of the\r\nWandering Humble bee (Bombus vagans): "I have found the males plentiful\r\nnear our garden fence, within a hole such as would be made by a mouse.\r\nThey seem to be quite numerous. I was attracted to it by the noise they\r\nwere making in fanning at the opening. I counted at one time as many as\r\nseven thus employed, and the sound could be heard several yards off.\r\nSeveral males were at rest, but mostly on the wing, when they would make\r\na dash among the fanners, and all would scatter and play about. The\r\nworkers seem to be of a uniform size, and full as large as the males. I\r\nthink the object of the fanning was to introduce air into the nest, as\r\nis done by the Honey bees."]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: "Since writing the above I have opened one of the new holes\r\nof Xylocopa, which was commenced between three and four weeks ago, in a\r\npine slat used in the staging of the greenhouse. The dimensions were as\r\nfollows:--Opening fully 3-8 wide; depth 7-16; whole length of tunnel 6\r\n5-16 inches. The tunnel branched both ways from the hole. One end, from\r\nopening, was 2 5-8, containing three cells, two with larva and pollen,\r\nthe third empty. The other side of the opening, or the rest of the\r\ntunnel, was empty, with the exception of the old bee (only one) at work.\r\nI think this was the work of one bee, and, as near as I can judge, about\r\ntwenty-five days\' work. Width of tunnel inside at widest 9-16 inch.\r\n\r\n"I have just found a Xylocopa bobbing at one of the holes, and in order\r\nto ascertain the depth of the tunnel, and to see whether there were any\r\nothers in them, I sounded with a pliable rod, and found others in one\r\nside, at a depth of five and one half inches; the other side was four\r\ninches deep without bees. The morning was cool, so that the object in\r\nbobbing could not have been to introduce fresh currents of air, but must\r\nhave had some relation to those inside. Their legs on such occasions\r\nare, as I have noticed, loaded with pollen."]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE HOME OF THE BEES.\r\n\r\n[_Concluded._]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Andrena and Halictus bees, whose habits we now describe, are\r\nclosely allied in form to the Hive bee, socially they are the\r\n"mud-sills" of bee society, ranking among the lowest forms of the family\r\nof bees. Their burrowing habits ally them with the ants, from whose\r\nnests their own burrows can scarcely be distinguished. Their economy\r\ndoes not seem to demand the exercise of so much of a true reasoning\r\npower and pliable instinct as characterizes bees, such as the Honey and\r\nHumble bee, which possess a high architectural skill. Moreover they are\r\nnot social; they have no part in rearing and caring for their young, a\r\nfact that lends so much interest to the history of the Hive and Humble\r\nbee. In this respect they are far below the wasps, a family belonging\r\nnext below in the system of Nature.\r\n\r\nA glance at the drawing (Fig. 28), of a burrow, with its side galleries,\r\nof the Andrena vicina, reveals the economy of one of our most common\r\nforms. Quite early in spring, when the sun and vernal breezes have dried\r\nup the soil, and the fields exchange their rusty hues for the rich green\r\nverdure of May, our Andrena, tired of its idle life among the blossoms\r\nof the willow, the wild cherry, and garden flowers, suddenly becomes\r\nremarkably industrious, and wields its spade-like jaws and busy feet\r\nwith a strange and unwonted energy. Choosing some sunny, warm, grassy\r\nbank (these nests were observed in the "great pasture" of Salem), not\r\nalways with a southern exposure however, the female sinks her deep well\r\nthrough the sod from six inches to a foot into the sandy soil beneath.\r\nShe goes to work literally tooth and nail. Reasoning from observations\r\nmade on several species of wasps, and also from studying the structure\r\nof her jaws and legs, it is evident that she digs in and loosens the\r\nsoil with her powerful jaws, and then throws out the dirt with her legs.\r\nShe uses her fore legs like hands, to pass the load of dirt to her hind\r\nlegs, and then runs backward out of her hole to dump it down behind her.\r\nMr. Emerton tells me that he never saw a bee in the act of digging but\r\nonce, and then she left off after a few strokes. He also says, "they are\r\nharmless and inoffensive. On several occasions I have lain on the grass\r\nnear their holes for hours, but not one attempted to sting me; and when\r\ntaken between the fingers, they make but feeble resistance."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.\r\n\r\nNest (natural size) of Andrena vicina, showing the main burrow, and the\r\ncells leading from it; the oldest cell containing the pupa (_a_) is\r\nsituated nearest the surface, while those containing the larva (_b_) lie\r\nbetween the pupa and the cell (_e_) containing the pollen mass and egg\r\nresting upon it. The most recent cell (_f_) is the deepest down, and\r\ncontains a freshly deposited pollen mass. At _c_ is the beginning of a\r\ncell; _g_, level of the ground.]\r\n\r\nTo enter somewhat into detail, we gather from the observations of Mr.\r\nEmerton (who has carefully watched the habits of these bees through\r\nseveral seasons) the following account of the economy of this bee: On\r\nthe 4th of May the bees were seen digging their holes, most of which\r\nwere already two inches deep, and one, six inches. The mounds of earth\r\nwere so small as to be hardly noticed. At this time an Oil beetle was\r\nseen prowling about the holes. The presence of this dire foe of Andrena\r\nat this time, it will be seen in a succeeding chapter on the enemies of\r\nthe bees, is quite significant. By the 15th of May, hundreds of Andrena\r\nholes were found in various parts of the pasture, and at one place, in a\r\nprevious season, there were about two hundred found placed within a\r\nsmall area. One cell was dug up, but it contained no pollen. Four days\r\nlater, several Andrenas were noticed resting from their toil at the\r\nopening of their burrows. On the 28th of May, in unearthing six holes,\r\neight cells were found to contain pollen, and in two of them a small\r\nlarva. The pellets of pollen are about the size of a small pea. They are\r\nhard and round at first, before the young has hatched, but as the larva\r\ngrows, the mass becomes softer and more pasty, so that the larva buries\r\nits head in the mass, and greedily sucks it in. When is the pollen\r\ngathered by the bee and kneaded into the pellet-like mass? On July 4th,\r\na cell was opened in which was a bee busily engaged preparing the\r\npollen, which was loosely and irregularly piled up, while there was a\r\nlarva in an adjoining cell nearly half an inch long. It would seem,\r\nthen, that the bee comes in from the fields laden with her stores of\r\npollen, which she elaborates into bee bread within her cell.\r\n\r\nWhen the bee returns to her cell she does not directly fly towards the\r\nentrance, since, as was noticed in a particular instance, she flew about\r\nfor a long time in all directions without any apparent aim, until she\r\nfinally settled near the hole, and walked into her subterranean retreat.\r\nOn a rainy day, May 24th, our friend visited the colony, but found no\r\nbees flying about the holes. The little hillocks had been beaten down by\r\nthe pitiless raindrops, and all traces of their industry effaced. On\r\ndigging down, several bees were found, indicating that on rainy days\r\nthey seek the shelter of their holes, and do not take refuge under\r\nleaves of the plants they frequent.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of June, six full-grown larv\xc3\xa6 were exhumed, and one, about\r\nhalf grown. On the 20th of July, the colony seemed well organized, as,\r\non laying open a burrow at the depth of six inches, he began to find\r\ncells. The upper ones, to the number of a dozen, were deserted and\r\nfilled with earth and grass roots, and had evidently been built and used\r\nduring the previous year. Below these were eight cells placed around the\r\nmain vertical gallery, reaching down to the depth of thirteen inches,\r\nand all containing nearly full-grown larv\xc3\xa6 of the bees, or else those of\r\nsome parasitic bee (Nomada) which had devoured the food prepared for the\r\nyoung Andrena.\r\n\r\nAbout the first of August the larva transforms to a pupa or chrysalis,\r\nas at this time two pup\xc3\xa6 were found in cells a foot beneath the surface.\r\nAs shown in the cut, those cells situated lowest down seem to be the\r\nlast to have been made, while the eggs laid in the highest are the first\r\nto hatch, and the larv\xc3\xa6 disclosed from them, the first to change to\r\npup\xc3\xa6. Four days later the pup\xc3\xa6 of Cuckoo bees (Nomada) were found in the\r\ncells. No Andrenas were seen flying about at this time.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of August, to be still very circumstantial in our narrative\r\nthough at the risk of being tedious, three burrows were unearthed, and\r\nin them three fully formed bees were found nearly ready to leave their\r\ncells, and in addition several pup\xc3\xa6. In some other cells there were\r\nthree of the parasitic Nomada also nearly ready to come out, which\r\nseemed to be identical with some bees noticed playing very innocently\r\nabout the holes early in the summer.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of August, very few of the holes were open. A number of\r\nOil beetles were strolling suspiciously about in the neighborhood, and\r\nsome little black Ichneumon flies were seen running about among the\r\nholes.\r\n\r\nDuring mid-summer the holes were found closed night and day by clods of\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe burrow is sunken perpendicularly, with short passages leading to the\r\ncells, which are slightly inclined downwards and outwards from the main\r\ngallery. The walls of the gallery are rough, but the cells are lined\r\nwith a mucous-like secretion, which, on hardening, looks like the\r\nglazing of earthenware. This glazing is quite hard, and breaks up into\r\nangular pieces. It is evidently the work of the bee herself, and is not\r\nsecreted and laid on by the larva. The diameter of the interior of the\r\ncell is about one-quarter of an inch, contracting a little at the mouth.\r\nWhen the cell is taken out, the dirt adheres for a line in thickness, so\r\nthat it is of the size and form of an acorn.\r\n\r\nThe larva of Andrena (Fig. 29) is soft and fleshy, like that of the\r\nHoney bee. Its body is flattened, bulging out prominently at the sides,\r\nand tapering more rapidly than usual towards each end of the body. The\r\nskin is very thin, so that along the back the heart or dorsal vessel may\r\nbe distinctly seen, pulsating about sixty times a minute.\r\n\r\nOur cut (Fig. 28, _a_) also represents the pupa, or chrysalis, as seen\r\nlying in its cell. The limbs are folded close to the body in the most\r\ncompact way possible. On the head of the semi-pupa, _i.e._, a transition\r\nstate between the larva and pupa, there are two prominent tubercles\r\nsituated behind the simple eyes, or ocelli; these are deciduous organs,\r\napparently aiding the insect in moving about its cell. They disappear in\r\nthe mature pupa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. Fig. 30. Fig. 31.\r\n\r\nFig. 31. Larva of Halictus parallelus.\r\n\r\nFig. 29. Larva of Andrena vicina.\r\n\r\nFig. 30. Pupa of Halictus parallelus seen from beneath.]\r\n\r\nTo those accustomed to rearing butterflies, and seeing the chrysalis at\r\nonce assuming its perfected shape, after the caterpillar skin is thrown\r\noff, it may seem strange to hear one speak of a "half-pupa," and of\r\nstages intermediate between the larva and pupa. But the external changes\r\nof form, though rapidly passed through, consisting apparently of a mere\r\nsloughing off of the outer skin, are yet preceded by slow and very\r\ngradual alterations of tissues, resulting from the growth of cells. An\r\ninner layer of the larva-skin separates from the outer, and, by changes\r\nin the form of the muscles, is drawn into different positions, such as\r\nis assumed by the pupa, which thus lies concealed beneath the\r\nlarva-skin. But a slight alteration is made in the general form of the\r\nlarva, consisting mostly of an enlargement of the thoracic segments,\r\nwhich is often overlooked, even by the special student, though of great\r\ninterest to the philosophic naturalist.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Emerton\'s observations we should judge that the pupa state\r\nlasted from three to four weeks, as the larv\xc3\xa6 began to transform the\r\nfirst of August, and appeared during the last week of the same month as\r\nperfect bees.\r\n\r\nThe Andrena is seen as late as the first week in September, and again\r\nearly in April, about the flowers of the willow. It is one of the\r\nlargest of its genus and a common species.\r\n\r\nHaving, in a very fragmentary way, sketched the life history of our\r\nAndrena and had some glimpses of its subterranean life, let us now\r\ncompare with it another genus of solitary bee (Halictus), quite closely\r\nallied in all respects, though a little lower in the scale.\r\n\r\nThe Halictus parallelus excavates cells almost exactly like those of\r\nAndrena; but since the bee is smaller, the holes are smaller, though as\r\ndeep. Mr. Emerton found one nest in a path a foot in depth. Another\r\nnest, discovered September 9th, was about six inches deep. The cells are\r\nin form like those of Andrena, and like them, are glazed within. The egg\r\nis rather slenderer and much curved; in form it is long, cylindrical,\r\nobtuse at one end, and much smaller at the other. The larva (Fig. 31) is\r\nlonger and slenderer, being quite different from the rather broad and\r\nflattened larva of Andrena. The body is rather thick behind, but in\r\nfront tapers slowly towards the head, which is of moderate size. Its\r\nbody is somewhat tuberculated, the tubercle aiding the grub in moving\r\nabout its cell. Its length is nearly one-half (.40) of an inch. On the\r\npupa are four quite distinct conical tubercles forming a transverse line\r\njust in front of the ocelli; and there are also two larger, longer\r\ntubercles, on the outer side of each of which, an ocellus is situated.\r\nFigure 30 represents the pupa seen from beneath.\r\n\r\nSearch was made on July 16th, where the ground was hard as stone for six\r\ninches in depth, below which the soil was soft and fine, and over twenty\r\ncells were dug out. "The upper cells contained nearly mature pup\xc3\xa6, and\r\nthe lower ones, larv\xc3\xa6 of various sizes, the smallest being hardly\r\ndistinguishable by the naked eye. Each of these small larv\xc3\xa6 was in a\r\ncell by itself, and situated upon a lump of pollen, which was the size\r\nand shape of a pea, and was found to lessen in size as the larva grew\r\nlarger. These young were probably the offspring of several females, as\r\nfour mature bees were found in the hole." The larva of an English\r\nspecies hatches in ten days after the eggs are laid.\r\n\r\nAnother brood of bees appeared the middle of September, as on the ninth\r\nof that month (1864) Mr. Emerton found several holes of the same species\r\nof bee, made in a hard gravel road near the turnpike. When opened, they\r\nwere found to contain several bees with their young. September 2nd, of\r\nthis year, the same kind of bee was found in holes, and just ready to\r\nleave the cell. It is probable that these bees winter over.\r\n\r\nWe have incidentally noticed the presence in the nests of Andrena and\r\nHalictus of a stranger bee, clad in gay, fantastic hues, which lives a\r\nparasitic life on its hosts. This parasitism does not go far enough to\r\ncause the death of the host, since we find the young of the parasitic\r\nCuckoo bee, in cells containing the young of the former.\r\n\r\nMr. F. Smith, in his "Catalogue of British Bees," says of this genus:\r\n"No one appears to know anything beyond the mere fact of their entering\r\nthe burrows of Andrenid\xc3\xa6 and Apid\xc3\xa6, except that they are found in the\r\ncells of the working bees in their perfect condition: it is most\r\nprobable that they deposit their eggs on the provision laid up by the\r\nworking bee, that they close up the cell, and that the working bee,\r\nfinding an egg deposited, commences a fresh cell for her own progeny."\r\n\r\nHe has, however, found two specimens of Nomada, sexfasciata in the cells\r\nof the long-horned bee, Eucera longicornis. He also states, that while\r\nsome species are constant in their attacks on certain Halicti and\r\nAndren\xc3\xa6, others attack different species of these genera\r\nindiscriminately. In like manner another Cuckoo bee (Coelioxys) is\r\nparasitic on Megachile and Saropoda; Stelis is a parasite on Osmia, the\r\nMason bee: and Melecta infests the cells of Anthophora.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Mr. Emerton enable us still further to clear up the\r\nhistory of this obscure visitor. He found both the larva and pupa, as\r\nwell as the perfect bee, in the cells of both genera; so that either\r\nboth kinds of bee, when hatched from eggs laid in the same cell, feed on\r\nthe same pollen mass, which therefore barely suffices for the\r\nnourishment of both; or the hostess, discovering the strange egg laid,\r\ncuckoo-like, in her own nest, has the forethought to deposit another\r\nball of pollen to secure the safety of her young.\r\n\r\nIs such an act the operation of a blind instinct? Does it not rather\r\nally our little bee with those higher animals which undoubtedly possess\r\na reasoning power? Its _instinct_ teaches it to build cells, and prepare\r\nits pollen mass, and lay an egg thereon. Its _reason_ enables it, in\r\nsuch an instance as this, when the life of the brood is threatened, to\r\nguard against any such danger by means to which it does not habitually\r\nresort. This instance is paralleled by the case of our common summer\r\nYellow bird, which, on finding an egg of the Cow bunting in its nest,\r\noften builds a new nest above it, to the certain destruction of the\r\nunwelcome egg in the nest beneath.\r\n\r\nIn the structure of the bee, and in all its stages of growth, our\r\nparasite seems lower in the zo\xc3\xb6logical scale than its host. It is\r\nstructurally a degraded form of Working-bee, and its position socially\r\nis unenviable. It is lazy, not having the provident habits of the\r\nWorking-bees; it aids not in the least, so far as we know, the\r\ncross-fertilization of plants--one great office in the economy of nature\r\nwhich most bees perform,--since it is not a pollen-gatherer, but on the\r\ncontrary is seemingly a drag and hinderance to the course of nature. But\r\nyet nature kindly, and as if by a special interposition, provides for\r\nits maintenance, and the humble naturalist can only exclaim, "God is\r\ngreat, and his ways mysterious," and go on studying and collecting\r\nfacts, leaving to his successors the more difficult task, but greater\r\njoy of discovering the cause and reason of things that are but a puzzle\r\nto the philosophers of this day.\r\n\r\nThe larva of Nomada may be known from those of its host, by its\r\nslenderer body and smaller head, while the body is smoother and more\r\ncylindrical. Both sexes of Nomada imbricata and N. pulchella were found\r\nby Mr. Emerton, the former in both the Andrena and Halictus nests, and\r\nboth were found in a single Andrena nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wood Wasp.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE PARASITES OF THE HONEY BEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery few bee-keepers are probably aware how many insect parasites infest\r\nthe Honey bee. In our own literature we hear almost nothing of this\r\nsubject, but in Europe much has been written on bee parasites. From Dr.\r\nEdward Assmuss\' little work on the "Parasites of the Honey Bee," we\r\nglean some of the facts now presented, and which cannot fail to interest\r\nthe general reader as well as the owner of bees.\r\n\r\nThe study of the habits of animal parasites has of late gained much\r\nattention among naturalists, and both the honey and wild bees afford\r\ngood examples of the singular relation between the host and the\r\nparasites which live upon it. Among insects generally, there are certain\r\nspecies which devour the contents of the egg of the victim. Others, and\r\nthis is the most common mode of parasitism, attack the insect in its\r\nlarva state; others, in the pupa state, and still others in the perfect,\r\nor imago state. Dr. Leidy has shown that the wood-devouring species of\r\nbeetle, Passalus cornutus, and some Myriopods, or "thousand legs," are,\r\nin some cases, tenanted by myriads of microscopic plants and worms which\r\nluxuriate in the alimentary canal, while the "caterpillar-fungus"\r\nattacks sickly caterpillars, filling out their bodies, and sending out\r\nshoots into the air, so that the insect looks as if transformed into a\r\nvegetable.\r\n\r\nThe Ichneumon flies, of which there are undoubtedly several thousand\r\nspecies in this country, are the most common insect parasites. Next to\r\nthese are the different species of Tachina and its allied genera. These,\r\nlike Ichneumons, live in the bodies of their hosts, consuming the fatty\r\nparts, and finishing their transformations just as the exhausted host\r\nis ready to die, issue from their bodies as flies, closely resembling\r\nthe common housefly.\r\n\r\nA small fly has been found in Europe to be the most formidable foe of\r\nthe hive bee, sometimes producing the well-known disease called\r\n"foul-brood," which is analogous to the typhus fever of man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 32. Phora and its Young.]\r\n\r\nThis fly, belonging to the genus Phora (Fig. 32, Phora incrassata; _a_,\r\nlarva; _b_, puparium; _c_, another species from Mammoth Cave), is a\r\nsmall insect about a line and a half long, and found in Europe during\r\nthe summer and autumn flying slowly about flowers and windows, and in\r\nthe vicinity of beehives. Its white, transparent larva is cylindrical, a\r\nlittle pointed before, but broader behind. The head is small and\r\nrounded, with short, three-jointed antenn\xc3\xa6, and at the posterior end of\r\nthe body are several slender spines. The puparium, or pupa case,\r\ninclosing the delicate chrysalis, is oval, consisting of eight segments,\r\nflattened above, with two large spines near the head, and four on the\r\nextremity of the body.\r\n\r\nWhen impelled by instinct to provide for the continuance of its species,\r\nthe Phora enters the beehive and gains admission to a cell, when it\r\nbores with its ovipositor through the skin of the bee larva, laying its\r\nlong oval egg in a horizontal position just under the skin. The embryo\r\nof the Phora is already well developed, so that in three hours after the\r\negg is inserted in the body of its unsuspecting and helpless host, the\r\nembryo is nearly ready to hatch. In about two hours more it actually\r\nbreaks off the larger end of the egg-shell and at once begins to eat the\r\nfatty tissues of its victim, its posterior half still remaining in the\r\nshell. In an hour more, it leaves the egg entirely and buries itself\r\ncompletely in the fatty portion of the young bee.\r\n\r\nThe maggot moults three times. In twelve hours after the last moult it\r\nturns around with its head towards the posterior end of the body of its\r\nhost, and in another twelve hours, having become full-fed, it bores\r\nthrough the skin of the young, eats its way through the brood-covering\r\nof the cell and falls to the bottom of the hive, where it changes to a\r\npupa in the dust and dirt, or else creeps out of the door and transforms\r\nin the earth. Twelve days after, the fly appears.\r\n\r\nThe young bee, emaciated and enfeebled by the attacks of its ravenous\r\nparasite, dies, and its decaying body fills the bottom of the cell with\r\na slimy, foul-smelling mass, called "foul-brood." This gives rise to a\r\nmiasma which poisons the neighboring brood, until the contagion (for the\r\ndisease is analogous to typhus, jail or ship-fever) spreads through the\r\nwhole hive, unless promptly checked by removing the cause and thoroughly\r\ncleansing the hive.\r\n\r\nFoul-brood sometimes attacks our American hives, and, though the cause\r\nmay not be known, yet from the hints given above we hope to have the\r\nhistory of our species of Phora cleared up, should our disease be found\r\nto be sometimes due to the attacks of such a parasitic fly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 33. Bee Louse and Larva.]\r\n\r\nWe figure the Bee louse of Europe (Fig. 33 b, Braula c\xc3\xa6ca), which is a\r\nsingular wingless spider-like fly, allied to the wingless Sheep tick\r\n(Melophagus), the wingless Bat tick (Nycteribia) and the winged Horse\r\nfly (Hippobosca). The head is very large, without eyes or ocelli (simple\r\neyes), while the ovate hind-body consists of five segments, and is\r\ncovered with stiff hairs. It is one-half to two-thirds of a line long.\r\nThis spider fly is "pupiparous," that is, the young, of which only a\r\nvery few are produced, is not born until it has assumed the pupa state\r\nor is just about to do so. The larva (Fig. 33 _a_) is oval,\r\neleven-jointed, and white in color. The very day it is hatched, it sheds\r\nits skin and changes to an oval puparium of a dark brown color.\r\n\r\nIts habits resemble those of the flea. Indeed, should we compress its\r\nbody strongly, it would bear a striking resemblance to that insect. It\r\nis evidently a connecting link between the flea, and the two winged\r\nflies. Like the former it lives on the body of its host, and obtains its\r\nfood by plunging its stout beak into the bee and sucking its blood.\r\n\r\nIt has not been noticed in this country, but is liable to be imported on\r\nthe bodies of Italian bees. Generally, one or two of the Braulas may, on\r\nclose examination, be detected on the body of the bee; sometimes the\r\npoor bees are loaded down by as many as a hundred of these hungry\r\nblood-suckers. Assmuss recommends rubbing them off with a feather, as\r\nthe bee goes in and out of the door of its hive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 34. Hive Trichodes.]\r\n\r\nAmong the beetles are a few forms occasionally found in bees\' nests and\r\nalso parasitic on the body of the bee. Trichodes apiarius (Fig. 34, _a_,\r\nlarva; _b_, pupa, front view) has long been known in Europe to attack\r\nthe young bees. In its perfect, or beetle state it is found on flowers,\r\nlike our Trichodes Nuttallii, which is commonly found on the Spir\xc3\xa6a in\r\nAugust, and which may yet prove to enter our beehives. The larva devours\r\nthe brood, but with the modern hive its ravages may be readily detected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 35. Melo\xc3\xab.]\r\n\r\nThe Oil beetle, Melo\xc3\xab angusticollis (Fig. 35, male, differing from the\r\nfemale by having the antenn\xc3\xa6 as if twisted into a knot; Fig. 36, the\r\nactive larva found on the body of the bee), is a large dark blue insect\r\nfound crawling in the grass in the vicinity of the nests of Andrena,\r\nHalictus, and other wild bees in May, and again in August and\r\nSeptember. The eggs are laid in a mass covered with earth at the root\r\nof some plant. During April and early in May, when the willows are in\r\nblossom, we have found the young recently hatched larv\xc3\xa6 in considerable\r\nabundance creeping briskly over the bees, or with their heads plunged\r\nbetween the segments of the body, greedily sucking in the juices of\r\ntheir host. Those that we saw occurred on the Humble and other wild\r\nbees, and on various flies (Syrphus and Muscid\xc3\xa6), and there is no reason\r\nwhy they should not infest the Honey bee, which frequents similar\r\nflowers, as they are actually known to do in Europe. These larv\xc3\xa6 are\r\nprobably hatched out near where the bees hibernate, so as to creep into\r\ntheir bodies before they fly in the spring, as it would be impossible\r\nfor them to crawl up a willow tree ten feet high or more, their feet\r\nbeing solely adapted for climbing over the hairy body of the bee, which\r\nthey do not leave until about to undergo their strange and unusual\r\ntransformations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Early Stages of Melo\xc3\xab.]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Assmuss states that on being brought into the nest by the\r\nbee, they leave the bee and devour the eggs in the bee cells, and then\r\nattack the bee bread. When full-fed and ready to pass through their\r\ntransformations to attain the beetle state, instead of at once assuming\r\nthe pupa and imago forms, as in the Trichodes represented in fig. 34,\r\nthey pass through a _hyper-metamorphosis_, as Fabre, a French\r\nnaturalist, calls it. In other words, the changes in form which are\r\npreparatory to assuming the pupa and imago states are more marked and\r\nalmost coequal with the larva and pupa states, so that the Melo\xc3\xab,\r\ninstead of passing through three states (the egg, larva and pupa), in\r\nrealty passes through these and two others in addition, which are\r\nintermediate. The whole subject of the metamorphosis of this beetle\r\nneeds revision, but Fabre states that the larva, soon after entering the\r\nnest of its host, changes its skin and assumes a second larva form.\r\nNewport, who with Siebold has carefully described the metamorphoses of\r\nMelo\xc3\xab, does not mention this stage in its development, which Fabre calls\r\n"pseudo-chrysalis." It is motionless, the head is mask-like, without\r\nmovable appendages, and the feet are represented by six tubercles. This\r\nis more properly speaking the semi-pupa, and the mature pupa grows\r\nbeneath its mask-like form, which is finally moulted. This form,\r\nhowever, according to Fabre, changes its skin and turns into a third\r\nlarva form (Fig. 37). After some time it assumes its true pupa form\r\n(Fig. 38), and finally moults this skin to appear as a beetle.\r\n\r\nFabre has also, in a lively and well-written account, given a history of\r\nSitaris, a European beetle, somewhat resembling Melo\xc3\xab. He states that\r\nSitaris lays its eggs near the entrance of bees\' nests, and at the very\r\nmoment that the bee lays her egg in the honey cell, the flattened, ovate\r\nSitaris larva drops from the body of the bee upon which it has been\r\nliving, and feasts upon the contents of the freshly laid egg. After\r\neating this delicate morsel it devours the honey in the cells of the bee\r\nand changes into a white, cylindrical, nearly footless grub, and after\r\nit is full-fed, and has assumed a supposed "pupa" state, the skin,\r\nwithout bursting, incloses a kind of hard "pupa" skin, which is very\r\nsimilar in outline to the former larva, within whose skin is found a\r\nwhitish larva which directly changes into the true pupa. In a succeeding\r\nstate this pupa in the ordinary way changes to a beetle which belongs to\r\nthe same group of Coleoptera as Melo\xc3\xab. We cannot but think, from\r\nobservations made on the humble bee, the wasp, two species of moths and\r\nseveral other insects, that this "hyper-metamorphosis" is not so\r\nabnormal a mode of insect metamorphosis as has been supposed, and that\r\nthe changes of these insects, made beneath the skin of the mature larva\r\nbefore assuming the pupa state, are almost as remarkable as those of\r\nMelo\xc3\xab and Sitaris, though less easily observed than they. Several other\r\nbeetles allied to Melo\xc3\xab are known to be parasitic on wild bees, though\r\nthe accounts of them are fragmentary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STYLOPS PARASITE.\r\n\r\nThe history of Stylops, a beetle allied to Melo\xc3\xab, is no less strange\r\nthan that of Melo\xc3\xab, and is in some respects still more interesting. On\r\nJune 18th I captured an Andrena vicina which had been "stylopized." On\r\nlooking at my capture I saw a pale reddish-brown triangular mark on the\r\nbee\'s abdomen; this was the flattened head and thorax of a female\r\nStylops (Fig. 39_a_, position of the female of Stylops, seen in profile\r\nin the abdomen of the bee; Fig. 39_b_, the female seen from above. The\r\nhead and thorax are soldered into a single flattened mass, the baggy\r\nhind-body being greatly enlarged like that of the gravid female of the\r\nwhite ant, and consisting of nine segments).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 39. Female Stylops.]\r\n\r\nOn carefully drawing out the whole body (Pl. 1, Fig. 6, as seen from\r\nabove, and showing the alimentary canal ending in a blind sac; Fig.\r\n6_a_, side view), which is very extensible, soft and baggy, and\r\nexamining it under a high power of the microscope, we saw multitudes, at\r\nleast several hundred, of very minute larv\xc3\xa6, like particles of dust to\r\nthe naked eye, issuing in every direction from the body of the parent\r\nnow torn open in places, though most of them made their exit through an\r\nopening on the under side of the head-thorax. The Stylops, being hatched\r\nwhile still in the body of the parent, is, therefore viviparous. She\r\nprobably never lays eggs.\r\n\r\nOn the last of April, when the Mezereon was in blossom, I caught the\r\nsingular looking male (Stylops Childreni, Fig. 40; a, side view; it is\r\nabout one-fourth of an inch long), which was as unlike its partner as\r\npossible. I laid it under a tumbler, when the delicate insect flew and\r\ntumbled about till it died of exhaustion in a few hours.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the larv\xc3\xa6 are hatched during the middle or last\r\nof June from eggs fertilized in April. The larv\xc3\xa6 then crawl out upon the\r\nbody of the bee, on which they are transported to the nest, where they\r\nenter, according to Peck\'s observations, the body of the larva, on whose\r\nfatty parts they feed. Previous to changing to a pupa the larva lives\r\nwith its head turned towards that of its host, but before assuming the\r\nperfect state (which they do in the late summer or autumn) it must\r\nreverse its position. The female protrudes the front part of her body\r\nbetween the segments of the abdomen of her host, as represented in our\r\nfigure. This change, Newport thinks, takes place after the bee-host has\r\nundergone its metamorphoses, though the bee does not leave her earthen\r\ncells until the following spring. Though the male Stylops deserts his\r\nhost, his wingless partner is imprisoned during her whole life within\r\nher host, and dies immediately after giving birth to her myriad (for\r\nNewport thinks she produces over two thousand) offspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 40. Male Stylops.]\r\n\r\nXenos Peckii, an allied insect, was discovered by Dr. Peck to be\r\nparasitic in the body of wasps, and there are now known to be several\r\nspecies of this small but curious family, Stylopid\xc3\xa6, which are known to\r\nlive parasitically on the bodies of our wild bees and wasps. The\r\npresence of these parasites finally exhausts the host, so that the\r\nsterile female bee dies prematurely.\r\n\r\nAs in the higher animals, bees are afflicted with parasitic worms which\r\ninduce disease and sometimes death. The well-known hair worm, Gordius,\r\nis an insect parasite. The adult form is about the size of a slender\r\nknitting needle, and is seen in moist soil and in pools. It lays,\r\naccording to Dr. Leidy, "millions of eggs connected together in long\r\ncords." The microscopical, tadpole-shaped young penetrate into the\r\nbodies of insects frequenting damp localities. Fairly ensconced within\r\nthe body of their unsuspecting host, they luxuriate on its fatty\r\ntissues, and pass through their metamorphoses into the adult form, when\r\nthey desert their living house and take to the water to lay their eggs.\r\nIn Europe, Siebold has described Gordius subbifurcus, which infests the\r\ndrones of the Honey bee, and also other insects. Professor Siebold has\r\nalso described Mermis albicans, which is a similar kind of hair worm,\r\nfrom two to five inches long, and whitish in color. This worm is also\r\nfound, strangely enough, only in the drones, though it is the workers\r\nwhich frequent watery places to appease their thirst.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 41. Bee fungus.]\r\n\r\nThousands of insects are carried off yearly by parasitic fungi. The\r\nravages of the Muscardine, caused by a minute fungus (Botrytris\r\nBassiana), have threatened the extinction of silk culture in Europe, and\r\nthe still more formidable disease called _pebrine_ is thought to be of\r\nvegetable origin. Dr. Leidy mentions a fungus which must annually carry\r\noff myriads of the Seventeen Year Locust. A somewhat similar fungus,\r\nMucor mellitophorus (Fig. 41), infests bees, filling the stomach with\r\nmicroscopical colorless spores, so as greatly to weaken the insect.\r\n\r\nAs there is a probability that many insects, parasites on the wild bees,\r\nmay sooner or later afflict the Honey bee, and also to illustrate\r\nfarther the complex nature of insect parasitism, we will for a moment\r\nlook at some other bee parasites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pl. 1\r\n\r\nPARASITES OF BEES.]\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous insects preying in some way upon the Humble bee are\r\nto be found other species of bees and moths, flies and beetles. Insect\r\nparasites often imitate their host: Apathus (Plate I, Fig. 1, A.\r\nAshtoni) can scarcely be distinguished from its host, and yet it lives\r\ncuckoo-like in the cells of the Humble bee, though we know not yet how\r\ninjurious it really is. Then there are Conops and Volucella, the\r\nformer of which lives like Tachina and Phora within the bee\'s body,\r\nwhile the latter devours the brood. The young (Plate I, Figs. 5, 5_a_)\r\nof another fly allied to Anthomyia, of which the Onion fly (Fig. 42) is\r\nan example, is also not unfrequently met with. A small beetle (Plate 1.\r\nFig. 4, Antherophagus ochraceus) is a common inmate of Humble bees\'\r\nnests, and probably feeds upon the wax and pollen. We have also found\r\nseveral larv\xc3\xa6 (Fig. 43) of a beetle of which we do not know the adult\r\nform. Of similar habits is probably a small moth (Nephopteryx Edmandsii,\r\nPlate I, Figs. 2; 2_a_, larva; Fig. 2_b_, chrysalis, or pupa) which\r\nundoubtedly feeds upon the waxen walls of the bee cells, and thus, like\r\nthe attacks of the common bee moth (Galleria cereana, whose habits are\r\nso well known as not to detain us, must prove very prejudicial to the\r\nwell being of the colony. This moth is in turn infested by an Ichneumon\r\nfly (Microgaster nephoptericis, Plate I, Figs. 3, 3_a_) which must prove\r\nquite destructive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 42. Onion Fly and Maggot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 43. Larva of Beetle.]\r\n\r\nThe figures of the early stages of a minute ichneumon represented on the\r\nsame plate (Fig. 7, larva, and 7_a_, pupa, of Anthophorabia megachilis)\r\nwhich is parasitic on Megachile, the Leaf-cutter bee, illustrates the\r\ntransformations of the Ichneumon flies, the smallest species of which\r\nyet known (and we believe the smallest insect known at all) is the\r\nPteratomus Putnami (Pl. I, Fig. 8, wanting the hind leg), or "winged\r\natom," which is only one-ninetieth of an inch in length, and is\r\nparasitic on Anthophorabia, itself a parasite. A species of mite (Plate\r\nI, Figs. 9; 9_a_, the same seen from beneath) is always to be found In\r\nhumble bees\' nests, but it is not thought to be specially obnoxious to\r\nthe bees themselves, though several species of mites (Gamasus, etc.) are\r\nknown to be parasitic on insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA FEW WORDS ABOUT MOTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe butterflies and moths from their beauty and grace, have always been\r\nthe favorites among amateur entomologists, and rare and costly works\r\nhave been published in which their forms and gorgeous colors are\r\nrepresented in the best style of natural history art. We need only\r\nmention the folio volume of Madam Merian of the last century, Harris\'s\r\nAurelian, the works of Cramer, Stoll, Drury, H\xc3\xbcbner, Horsfield,\r\nDoubleday and Westwood, and Hewitson, as comprising the most luxurious\r\nand costly entomological works.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the last century, John Abbot went from London and\r\nspent several years in Georgia, rearing the larger and more showy\r\nbutterflies and moths, and painting them in the larva, chrysalis and\r\nadult, or imago stage. These drawings he sent to London to be sold. Many\r\nof them were collected by Sir James Edward Smith, and published under\r\nthe title of "The Natural History of the Rarer Lepidopterous Insects of\r\nGeorgia, collected from the Observations of John Abbot, with the Plants\r\non which they Feed." (London, 1797. 2 vols., fol.) Besides these two\r\nrare volumes there are sixteen folio volumes of drawings by Abbot in the\r\nLibrary of the British Museum. This work is of especial interest to the\r\nAmerican student as it illustrates the early stages of many of our\r\nbutterflies and moths.\r\n\r\nIndeed the study of insects possesses most of its interest when we\r\nobserve their habits and transformations. Caterpillars are always to be\r\nfound, and with a little practice are easy to raise; we would therefore\r\nadvise any one desirous of beginning the study of insects to take up the\r\nbutterflies and moths. They are perhaps easier to study than any other\r\ngroup of insects, and are more ornamental in the cabinet. As a\r\nscientific study we would recommend it to ladies as next to botany in\r\ninterest and in the ease in which specimens may be collected and\r\nexamined. The example of Madam Merian, and several ladies in this\r\ncountry who have greatly aided science by their well filled cabinets,\r\nand critical knowledge of the various species and their transformations,\r\nis an earnest of what may be expected from their followers. Though the\r\nmoths are easy to study compared with the bees, flies, beetles and bugs,\r\nand dragon flies, yet many questions of great interest in philosophical\r\nentomology have been answered by our knowledge of their structure and\r\nmode of growth. The great works of Herold on the evolution of a\r\ncaterpillar; of Lyonet on the anatomy of the Cossus; of Newport on that\r\nof the Sphinx; and of Siebold on the parthenogenesis of insects, are\r\nproofs that the moths have engaged the attention of some of the master\r\nminds in science.\r\n\r\nThe study of the transformations of the moths is also of great\r\nimportance to one who would acquaint himself with the questions\r\nconcerning the growth and metamorphoses and origin of animals. We should\r\nremember that the very words "metamorphosis" and "transformation," now\r\nso generally applied to other groups of animals and used in\r\nphilosophical botany, were first suggested by those who observed that\r\nthe moth and butterfly attain their maturity only by passing through\r\nwonderful changes of form and modes of life.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the fact that all animals pass through some sort of a\r\nmetamorphosis is very recent in physiology. Moreover the fact that these\r\nmorphological eras in the life of an individual animal accord most\r\nunerringly with the gradation of forms in the type of which it is a\r\nmember, was the discovery of the eminent physiologist Von Baer. Up to\r\nthis time the true significance of the luxuriance and diversity of\r\nlarval forms had never seriously engaged the attention of systematists\r\nin entomology.\r\n\r\nWhat can possibly be the meaning of all this putting on and taking off\r\nof caterpillar habiliments, or in other words, the process of moulting,\r\nwith the frequent changes in ornamentation, and the seeming\r\nfastidiousness and queer fancies and strange conceits of these young and\r\ngiddy insects seems hidden and mysterious to human observation. Indeed,\r\nfew care to spend the time and trouble necessary to observe the insect\r\nthrough its transformations; and that done, if only the larva of the\r\nperfect insect can be identified and its form sketched how much was\r\ngained! A truthful and circumstantial biography, in all its relations,\r\nof a single insect has yet to be written!\r\n\r\nWe should also apply our knowledge of the larval forms of insects to the\r\ndetails of their classification into families and genera, constantly\r\ncollating our knowledge of the early stages with the structural\r\nrelations that accompany them in the perfect state.\r\n\r\nThe simple form of the caterpillar seems to be a concentration of the\r\ncharacters of the perfect insect, and presents easy characters by which\r\nto distinguish the minor groups; and the relative rank of the higher\r\ndivisions will only be definitely settled when their forms and methods\r\nof transformation are thoroughly known. Thus, for example, in two groups\r\nof the large Attacus-like moths, which are so amply illustrated in Dr.\r\nHarris\'s "Treatise on Insects injurious to Vegetation"; if we take the\r\ndifferent forms of the caterpillars of the Tau moth of Europe, which are\r\nfigured by Duponchel and Godard, we find that the very young larva has\r\nfour horn-like processes on the front, and four on the back part of the\r\nbody. The full grown larva of the Regalis moth, of the Southern and\r\nMiddle states, is very similarly ornamented. It is an embryonic form,\r\nand therefore inferior in rank to the Tau moth. Multiply these horns\r\nover the surface of the body, lessen their size, and crown them with\r\nhairs, and we have our Io moth, so destructive to corn. Now take off the\r\nhairs, elongating and thinning out the tubercles, and make up the loss\r\nby the increased size of the worm, and we have the caterpillar of our\r\ncommon Cecropia moth. Again, remove the naked tubercles almost wholly,\r\nsmooth off the surface of the body, and contract its length, thus giving\r\na greater convexity and angularity to the rings, and we have before us\r\nthe larva of the stately Luna moth that tops this royal family. Here are\r\ncertain criteria for placing these insects before our minds in the order\r\nthat nature has placed them. We have certain facts for determining which\r\nof these three insects is highest and which lowest in the scale, when we\r\nsee the larva of the Luna moth throwing off successively the Io and\r\nCecropia forms to take on its own higher features. So that there is a\r\nmeaning in all this shifting of insect toggery.\r\n\r\nThis is but an example of the many ways in which both pleasure and\r\nmental profit may be realized from the thoughtful study of caterpillar\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn collecting butterflies and moths for cabinet specimens, one needs a\r\ngauze net a foot and a half deep, with the wire frame a foot in\r\ndiameter; a wide-mouthed bottle containing a parcel of cyanide of\r\npotassium gummed on the side, in which to kill the moths, which should,\r\nas soon as life is extinct, be pinned in a cork-lined collecting box\r\ncarried in the coat pocket. The captures should then be spread and dried\r\non a grooved setting board, and a cabinet formed of cork-lined boxes or\r\ndrawers; as a substitute for cork, frames with paper tightly stretched\r\nover them may be used, or the pith of corn-stalks or palm wood.\r\nCaterpillars should be preserved in spirits, or in glycerine with a\r\nlittle alcohol added.\r\n\r\nSome persons ingeniously empty the skins and inflate them over a flame\r\nso that they may be pinned by the side of the adult.\r\n\r\nSome of the most troublesome and noxious insects are found among the\r\nmoths. I need only mention the canker worm and American tent\r\ncaterpillar, and the various kinds of cut worms, as instances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 43. Parasite of the American Silk Worm.]\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, forget the good done by insects. They undoubtedly\r\ntend by their attacks to prevent an undue growth of vegetation. The\r\npruning done to a tree or herb by certain insects undoubtedly causes a\r\nmore healthy growth of the branches and leaves, and ultimately a greater\r\nproduction fruit. Again, as pollen-bearers, insects are a most powerful\r\nagency in nature. It is undoubtedly the fact that the presence, of bees\r\nin orchards increases the fruit crop, and thus the thousands of moths\r\n(though injurious as caterpillars), wild bees and other insects, that\r\nseem to live without purpose, are really, though few realize it, among\r\nthe best friends and allies of man.\r\n\r\nMoreover, insects are of great use as scavengers; such are the young or\r\nmaggots of the house fly, the mosquitoes, and numerous other forms, that\r\nseem created only to vex us when in the winged state. Still a larger\r\nproportion of insects are directly beneficial from their habit of\r\nattacking injurious species, such as the ichneumons (Fig. 43, the\r\nichneumon of the American silk worm) and certain flies (Fig. 44,\r\nTachina); also many carnivorous species of wasps beetles and flies,\r\ndragon flies and Aphis lions (Fig. 45, the lace-winged fly; adult, larva\r\nand eggs).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 44. Tachina, parasite of Colorado Potato Beetle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 45. The Lace-winged Fly, Its Larva and Eggs.]\r\n\r\nBut few, however, suspect how enormous are the losses to crops in this\r\ncountry entailed by the attacks of the injurious species. In Europe, the\r\nsubject of applied entomology has always attracted a great deal of\r\nattention. Most sumptuous works, elegant quartos prepared by naturalists\r\nknown the world over, and published at government expense, together with\r\nsmaller treatises, have frequently appeared; while the subject is taught\r\nin the numerous agricultural colleges and schools, especially of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIn the densely populated countries of Europe, the losses occasioned by\r\ninjurious insects are most severely felt, though from many causes, such\r\nas the greater abundance of their insect parasites, and the far greater\r\ncare taken by the people to exterminate their insect enemies, they have\r\nnot proved so destructive as in our own land.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I may quote from one of Dr. Asa Fitch\'s reports on\r\nthe noxious insects of New York, where he says: "I find that in our\r\nwheat-fields here, the midge formed 59 per cent. of all the insects on\r\nthis grain the past summer; whilst in France, the preceding summer, only\r\n7 per cent. of the insects on wheat were of this species. In France the\r\nparasitic destroyers amounted to 85 per cent.; while in this country our\r\nparasites form only 10 per cent."\r\n\r\n"A true knowledge of practical entomology may well be said to be in its\r\ninfancy in our own country, when, as is well-known to agriculturists,\r\nthe cultivation of wheat has almost been given up in New England, New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia, from the attacks of the wheat\r\nmidge, Hessian fly, joint worm, and chinch bug. According to Dr.\r\nShimer\'s estimate, says Mr. Riley, in his Second Annual Report on the\r\nInjurious Insects of Missouri, which may be considered a reasonable\r\none, in the year 1864 three-fourths of the wheat, and one-half of the\r\ncorn crop were destroyed by the chinch bug throughout many extensive\r\ndistricts, comprising almost the entire North-West. At the annual rate\r\nof increase, according to the United States Census, in the State of\r\nIllinois, the wheat crop ought to have been about thirty millions of\r\nbushels, and the corn crop about one hundred and thirty-eight million\r\nbushels. Putting the cash value of wheat at $1.25, and that of corn at\r\n50 cents, the cash value of the corn and wheat destroyed by this\r\ninsignificant little bug, no bigger than a grain of rice, in one single\r\nState and one single year, will therefore, according to the above\r\nfigures, foot up to the astounding total of _over seventy-three millions\r\nof dollars_!"\r\n\r\nThe imported cabbage butterfly (Pieris rap\xc3\xa6), recently introduced from\r\nEurope, is estimated by the Abb\xc3\xa9 Provatncher, a Canadian entomologist,\r\nto destroy annually two hundred and forty thousand dollars\' worth of\r\ncabbages around Quebec. The Hessian fly, according to Dr. Fitch,\r\ndestroyed fifteen million dollars\' worth of wheat in New York State in\r\none year (1854). The army worm of the North (Leucania unipuncta), which\r\nwas so abundant in 1861, from New England to Kansas, was reported to\r\nhave done damage that year in Eastern Massachusetts exceeding half a\r\nmillion of dollars. The joint worm (Isosoma hordei) alone sometimes cuts\r\noff whole fields of grain in Virginia and northward. The Colorado potato\r\nbeetle is steadily moving eastward, now ravaging the fields in Indiana\r\nand Ohio, and only the forethought and ingenuity in devising means of\r\nchecking its attacks, resulting from a thorough study of its habits,\r\nwill deliver our wasted fields from its direful assaults.\r\n\r\nThese are the injuries done by the more abundant kinds of insects\r\ninjurious to crops. We should not forget that each fruit or shade tree,\r\ngarden shrub or vegetable, has a host of insects peculiar to it, and\r\nwhich, year after year, renew their attacks. I could enumerate upwards\r\nof fifty species of insects which prey upon cereals and grass, and as\r\nmany which infest our field crops. Some thirty well known species ravage\r\nour garden vegetables. There are nearly fifty species which attack the\r\ngrape vine, and their number is rapidly increasing. About seventy-five\r\nspecies make their annual onset upon the apple tree, and nearly an equal\r\nnumber may be found upon the plum, pear, peach and cherry. Among our\r\nshade trees, over fifty species infest the oak; twenty-five the elm;\r\nseventy-five the walnut, and over one hundred species of insects prey\r\nupon the pine.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we may reasonably calculate the annual loss in our country\r\nalone, from noxious animals and the lower forms of plants, such as rust,\r\nsmut and mildew, as (at a low estimate) not far from five hundred\r\nmillion dollars annually. Of this amount, at least one-tenth, or fifty\r\nmillion dollars, could probably be saved by human exertions.\r\n\r\nTo save a portion of this annual loss of food stuffs, fruits and lumber,\r\nshould be the first object of farmers and gardeners. When this saving is\r\nmade, farming will become a profitable and safe profession. But while a\r\nfew are well informed as to the losses sustained by injurious insects,\r\nand use means to ward off their attacks, their efforts are constantly\r\nfoiled by the negligence of their neighbors. As illustrated so well by\r\nthe history of the incursions of the army worm and canker worm, it is\r\nonly by a combination between farmers and orchardists that these and\r\nother pests can be kept under. The matter can be best reached by\r\nlegislation. We have fish and game laws; why should we not have an\r\ninsect law? Why should we not frame a law providing that farmers, and\r\nall owning a garden or orchard, should cooperate in taking preventive\r\nmeasures against injurious insects, such as early or late planting of\r\ncereals, to avert the attacks of the wheat midge and Hessian fly; the\r\nburning of stubble in the autumn and spring to destroy the joint worm;\r\nthe combined use of proper remedies against the canker worm, the\r\nvarious cut worms, and other noxious caterpillars? A law carried out by\r\na proper State entomological constabulary, if it may be so designated,\r\nwould compel the idle and shiftless to clear their farms and gardens of\r\nnoxious animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 46. Pickle Worm and its Moth.]\r\n\r\nAmong some of the injurious insects reported on by Mr. Riley, the State\r\nEntomologist of Missouri, is a new pest to the cucumber in the West, the\r\nPickle worm (Phacellura nitidalis, Fig. 46). This is a caterpillar which\r\nbores into the cucumbers when large enough to pickle, and which is\r\noccasionally found in pickles. Three or four worms sometimes occur in a\r\ncucumber, and in the garden a single one will cause it to rot. One of\r\nthe most troublesome intruders in our graperies is the Vine dresser\r\n(Choerocampa pampinatrix, Fig. 47, larva and pupa; Fig. 48, adult), a\r\nsingle caterpillar of which will sometimes "strip a small vine of its\r\nleaves in a few nights," and occasionally nips off bunches of half-grown\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 48. Vine Dresser Moth.\r\n\r\n47. Vine Dresser and Chrysalis.]\r\n\r\nAnother caterpillar, which is sometimes so abundant as nearly to\r\ndefoliate the grape vine, is the eight spotted Alypia (Fig. 49; _a_,\r\nlarva; _b_, side view of a segment). This must not be confounded with\r\nthe bluish larva of the Wood Nymph, Eudryas grata (Fig. 50), which\r\ndiffers from the Alypia caterpillar in being bluish, and in wanting the\r\nwhite patches on the side of the body, and the more prominent hump on\r\nthe end of the body. Another moth (Psychomorpha epimenis, Fig. 51,\r\n_a_, larva; _b_, side view of a segment; _c_, top view of the hump),\r\nalso feeds on the grape, eating the terminal buds. It is also bluish,\r\nand wants the orange bands on the side of the body. Another moth of this\r\nfamily is the American Procris (Acoloithus Americana, Fig. 52_a_, larva;\r\n_b_, pupa; _c_, cocoon; _d_, _e_, imago); a dark blue moth, with a deep\r\norange collar, whose black and yellow caterpillar is gregarious (Fig.\r\n53), living in companies of a dozen or more and eating the softer parts\r\nof the leaves. It is quite common in the Western and Southern States.\r\nThe figure represents two separate broods of caterpillars feeding on\r\neither side of the midrib of the leaf. But if the moths are, as a rule,\r\nthe enemies of our crops, there are the silk worms of the East and\r\nSouthern Europe and California, which afford the means of support to\r\nmultitudes of the poorer classes, and supply one of the most valuable\r\narticles of clothing. Blot out the silk worm, and we should remove one\r\nof the most important sources of national wealth, the annual revenue\r\nfrom the silk trade of the world amounting to $254,500,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 49. Eight-spotted Alypia and Larva.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 50. Eudryas grata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 51. Larva of Psychomorpha.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 52. American Procris and Young.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 53. Larv\xc3\xa6 of American Procris.]\r\n\r\nSilk culture is rapidly assuming importance in California, and though\r\nthe Chinese silk worm has not been successfully cultivated in the\r\nEastern States, yet the American silk worm, Teleas Polyphemus (see\r\nfrontispiece, male; Fig. 54, larva; 55, pupa; 56, cocoon), can, we are\r\nassured by Mr. Trouvelot, be made a source of profit.\r\n\r\nThis is a splendid member of the group of which the gigantic Attacus\r\nAtlas of China is a type. It is a large, fawn colored moth with a tawny\r\ntinge; the caterpillar is pale green, and is of the size indicated in\r\nthe cut. Mr. Trouvelot says that of the several kinds of silk worms, the\r\nlarva of the present species alone deserves attention. The cocoons of\r\nPlatysamia Cecropia may be rendered of some commercial value, as the\r\nsilk can be carded, but the chief objection is the difficulty of raising\r\nthe larva.\r\n\r\n"The Polyphemus worm spins a strong, dense, oval cocoon, which is closed\r\nat each end, while the silk has a very strong and glossy fibre." Mr.\r\nTrouvelot, from whose interesting account in the first volume of the\r\n"American Naturalist" we quote, says that in 1865 "not less than a\r\nmillion could be seen feeding in the open air upon bushes covered with a\r\nnet; five acres of woodland were swarming with caterpillar life." The\r\nbushes were scrub oaks, the worms being protected by a net. After\r\nmeeting with such great success Mr. Trouvelot lost all his worms by\r\npebrine, the germs being imported in eggs received from Japan through M.\r\nGu\xc3\xa9rin-M\xc3\xa9neville of Paris. Enough, however, was done to prove that silk\r\nraising can be carried on profitably, when due precautions are taken, as\r\nfar north as Boston. As this moth extends to the tropics, it can be\r\nreared with greater facility southwards. The cocoon is strong and dense,\r\nand closed at each end, so that the thread is continuous, while the silk\r\nhas a very strong and glossy fibre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 54. American Silk Worm.]\r\n\r\nNext in value to the American silk worm, is the Ailanthus silk worm\r\n(Samia Cynthia) a species allied to our Callosamia Promethea. It\r\noriginated from China, where it is cultivated, and was introduced into\r\nItaly in 1858, and thence spread into France, where it was introduced by\r\nM. Gu\xc3\xa9rin-M\xc3\xa9neville. Its silk is said to be much stronger than the fibre\r\nof cotton, and is a mean between fine wool and ordinary silk. The worm\r\nis very hardy, and can be reared in the open air both in this country\r\nand in Europe. The main drawback to its culture is the difficulty in\r\nunreeling the tough cocoon, and the shortness of the thread, the cocoon\r\nbeing open at one end.\r\n\r\nThe Yama-ma\xc3\xaf moth (Anther\xc3\xa6a Yama-ma\xc3\xaf) was introduced into France from\r\nJapan in 1861. It is closely allied to the Polyphemus moth, and its\r\ncaterpillar also feeds on the oak. Its silk is said to be quite\r\nbrilliant, but a little coarser and not so strong as that of the Bombyx\r\nmori. The Perny silk worm is extensively cultivated by the Chinese in\r\nManchouria, where it feeds on the oak. Its silk is coarser than that of\r\nthe common silk worm, but is yet fine, strong and glossy. Bengal has\r\nfurnished the Tussah moth, which lives in India on the oak and a variety\r\nof other trees. It is largely raised in French and English India,\r\naccording to Nogu\xc3\xa9s, and is used in the manufacture of stuffs called\r\ncorahs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 55. Chrysalis of American Silk Worm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 56. Cocoon of American Silk Worm.]\r\n\r\nThe last kind of importance is the Arrhindy silk worm, from India. It\r\nhas been naturalized in France and Algeria by M. Gu\xc3\xa9rin-M\xc3\xa9neville, who\r\nhas done so much in the application of entomology to practical life. It\r\nis closely allied to the Cynthia or Ailanthus worm, with the same kind\r\nof silk and a similar cocoon, and feeds on the castor oil plant.\r\n\r\nThe diseases of silk worms naturally receive much attention. Like those\r\nafflicting mankind, they arise from bad air, resulting from too close\r\nconfinement, bad food, and other adverse causes. The most fatal and\r\nwide-spread disease, and one which since 1854 has threatened the\r\nextermination of silk worms in Europe, is the _pebrine_. It is due to\r\nthe presence of minute vegetable corpuscles, which attack both the worms\r\nand the eggs. It was this disease which swept off thousands of Mr.\r\nTrouvelot\'s Polyphemus worms, and put a sudden termination to his\r\nimportant experiments, the germs having been implanted in eggs of the\r\nYama-ma\xc3\xaf moth imported from Japan by M. Gu\xc3\xa9rin-M\xc3\xa9neville, and which were\r\nprobably infected as they passed through Paris. Though the disaster\r\nhappened several years since, he tells us that it will be useless for\r\nhim to attempt the raising of silk worms in the town where his\r\nestablishment is situated, as the germs of the disease are most\r\ndifficult to eradicate.\r\n\r\nSo direful in France were the ravages of this disease that two of the\r\nmost advanced naturalists in France, Quatrefages and Pasteur, were\r\ncommissioned by the French government to investigate the disease.\r\nPasteur found that the infected eggs differed in appearance from the\r\nsound ones, and could thus be sorted out by aid of the microscope and\r\ndestroyed. Thus these investigations, carried on year after year, and\r\nseeming to the ignorant to tend to no practical end, resulted in saving\r\nto France her silk culture. During the past year (1871) so successful\r\nhas his method proved that a French scientific journal expresses the\r\nhope of the complete reestablishment and prosperity of this great\r\nindustry. A single person who obtained in 1871 in his nurseries 30,000\r\nounces of eggs, hopes the next year to obtain 100,000 ounces, from which\r\nhe expects to realize about one million dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Potato Caterpillar.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CLOTHES MOTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor over a fortnight we once enjoyed the company of the caterpillar of a\r\ncommon clothes moth. It is a little pale, delicate worm (Fig. 57,\r\nmagnified), about the size of a darning needle, and rather less than\r\nhalf an inch in length, with a pale horn-colored head, the ring next the\r\nhead being of the same color. It has sixteen feet, the first six of them\r\nwell developed and constantly in use to draw the slender body in and out\r\nof its case. Its head is armed with a formidable pair of jaws, with\r\nwhich, like a scythe, it mows its way through thick and thin.\r\n\r\nBut the case is the most remarkable feature in the history of this\r\ncaterpillar. Hardly has the helpless, tiny worm broken out of the egg,\r\npreviously laid in some old garment of fur or wool, or perhaps in the\r\nhaircloth of a sofa, when it begins to make a shelter by cutting the\r\nwoolly fibres or soft hairs into bits, which it places at each end in\r\nsuccessive layers, and, joining them together by silken threads,\r\nconstructs a cylindrical tube (Fig. 58) of thick, warm felt, lined\r\nwithin with the finest silk the tiny worm can spin. The case is not\r\nperfectly cylindrical, being flattened slightly in the middle, and\r\ncontracted a little just before each end, both of which are always kept\r\nopen. The case before us is of a stone-gray color, with a black stripe\r\nalong the middle, and with rings of the same color round each opening.\r\nHad the caterpillar fed on blue or yellow cloth, the case would, of\r\ncourse, have been of those colors. Other cases, made by larv\xc3\xa6 which had\r\nbeen eating loose cotton, were quite irregular in form, and covered\r\nloosely with bits of cotton thread, which the little tailor had not\r\ntrimmed off.\r\n\r\nDays go by. A vigorous course of dieting on its feast of wool has given\r\nstature to our hero. His case has grown uncomfortably small. Shall he\r\nleave it and make another? No housewife is more prudent and saving. Out\r\ncome those scissor-jaws, and, lo! a fearful rent along each side of one\r\nend of the case. Two wedge-shaped patches mend the breach; the\r\ncaterpillar retires for a moment and reappears at the other end; the\r\nscissors are once more pulled out; two rents appear, to be filled up by\r\ntwo more patches or gores, and our caterpillar once again breathes more\r\nfreely, laughs and grows fat upon horse hair and lambs\' wool. In this\r\nway he enlarges his case till he stops growing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 59. 58. 57.\r\n\r\nEarly Stages of the Clothes Moth.]\r\n\r\nOur caterpillar seeming to be full-grown, and apparently out of\r\nemployment, we cut the end of his case half off. Two or three days\r\nafter, he had mended it from the inside, drawing the two edges together\r\nby silken threads, and, though he had not touched the outside, yet so\r\nneatly were the two parts joined together that we had to search for some\r\ntime, with a lens, to find the scar.\r\n\r\nTo keep our friend busy during the cold, cheerless weather, for it was\r\nmid-winter, we next cut a third of the case entirely off. Nothing\r\ndaunted, the little fellow bustled about, drew in a mass of the woolly\r\nfibres, filling up the whole mouth of his den, and began to build on\r\nafresh, and from the inside, so that the new-made portion was smaller\r\nthan the rest of the case. The creature worked very slowly, and the\r\naddition was left in a rough, unfinished state.\r\n\r\nWe could easily spare these voracious little worms hairs enough to serve\r\nas food, and to afford material for the construction of their paltry\r\ncases; but that restless spirit that ever urges on all beings endowed\r\nwith life and the power of motion, never forsakes the young clothes moth\r\nfor a moment. He will not be forced to drag his heavy case over rough\r\nhairs and furzy wool, hence with his keen jaws he cuts his way through.\r\nThus, the more he travels, the more mischief he does.\r\n\r\nAfter taking his fill of this sort of life he changes to a chrysalid\r\n(Fig. 59), and soon appears as one of those delicate, tiny, demure\r\nmoths that fly in such numbers from early in the spring until the\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\nVery many do not recognize these moths in their perfect stage, so small\r\nare they, and vent their wrath on those great millers that fly around\r\nlamps in warm summer evenings. It need scarcely be said that these large\r\nmillers are utterly guiltless of any attempts upon our wardrobes; they\r\nmake their attacks in a more open form on our gardens and orchards.\r\n\r\nWe will give a more careful description of the clothes moth, which was\r\nfound in its different stages June 12th in a mass of loose cotton. The\r\nlarva is white, with a tolerably plump body, which tapers slightly\r\ntowards the tail, while the head is much of the color of gum-copal. The\r\nrings of the body are thickened above, especially on the thoracic ones,\r\nby two transverse thickened folds. It is one-fifth of an inch long.\r\n\r\nThe body of the chrysalis, or pupa, is considerably curved, with the\r\nhead smooth and rounded. The long antenn\xc3\xa6, together with the hind legs,\r\nwhich are folded along the breast, reach to the tip of the hind body, on\r\nthe upper surface of each ring of which is a short transverse row of\r\nminute spines, which aid the chrysalis in moving towards the mouth of\r\nits case, just before the moth appears. At first the chrysalis is\r\nwhitish, but just before the exclusion of the moth becomes the color of\r\nvarnish.\r\n\r\nWhen about to cast its pupa skin, the skin splits open on the back, and\r\nthe perfect insect glides out. The act is so quickly over with, that the\r\nobserver has to look sharp to observe the different steps in the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 60. Clothes Moth.]\r\n\r\nOur common clothes moth (Tinea flavifrontella, Fig. 60) is of a uniform\r\nlight-buff color, with a silky iridescent lustre, the hind wings and\r\nabdomen being a little paler. The head is thickly tufted with hairs and\r\nis a little tawny, and the upper side of the densely hirsute feelers\r\n(palpi) is dusky. The wings are long and narrow, with the most beautiful\r\nand delicate long silken fringe, which increases in length towards the\r\nbase of the wing.\r\n\r\nThey begin to fly in May, and last all through the season, fluttering\r\nwith a noiseless, stealthy flight in our apartments, and laying their\r\neggs in our woollens.\r\n\r\nSuccessive broods of the clothes moth appear through the summer. In the\r\nautumn they cease eating, retire within their cases, and early in spring\r\nassume the chrysalis state.\r\n\r\nThere are several allied species which have much the same habits, except\r\nthat they do not all construct cases, but eat carpets, clothing,\r\narticles of food, grain, etc., and objects of natural history.\r\n\r\nCareful housewives are not much afflicted with these pests. The slovenly\r\nand thriftless are overrun with them. Early in June woollens and furs\r\nshould be carefully dusted, shaken and beaten. Dr. T. W. Harris states\r\nthat "powdered black pepper, strewed under the edge of carpets, is said\r\nto repel moths. Sheets of paper sprinkled with spirits of turpentine,\r\ncamphor in coarse powder, leaves of tobacco, or shavings of Russia\r\nleather, should be placed among the clothes when they are laid aside for\r\nthe summer; and furs and other small articles can be kept by being sewed\r\nin bags with bits of camphor wood, red cedar, or of Spanish cedar; while\r\nthe cloth lining of carriages can be secured forever from the attacks of\r\nmoths by being washed or sponged on both sides with a solution of the\r\ncorrosive sublimate of mercury in alcohol, made just strong enough not\r\nto leave a white stain on a black feather." The moths can be most\r\nreadily killed by pouring benzine among them, though its use must be\r\nmuch restricted from the disagreeable odor which remains. The recent\r\nexperiments made with carbolic acid, however, convince us that this will\r\nsoon take the place of other substances as a preventive and destroyer of\r\nnoxious insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Juniper Sickle-wing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE MOSQUITO AND ITS FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of flies becomes of vast moment to a Pharaoh, whose ears are\r\ndinned with the buzz of myriad winged plagues, mingled with angry cries\r\nfrom malcontent and fly-pestered subjects; or to the summer traveller in\r\nnorthern lands, where they oppose a stronger barrier to his explorations\r\nthan the loftiest mountains or the broadest streams; or to the African\r\npioneer, whose cattle, his main dependence, are stung to death by the\r\nTsetze fly; or the fariner whose eyes on the evening of a warm spring\r\nday, after a placid contemplation of his growing acres of wheat blades,\r\nsuddenly detects in dismay clouds of the Wheat midge and Hessian fly\r\nhovering over their swaying tops. The subject, indeed, has in such cases\r\na national importance, and a few words regarding the main points in the\r\nhabits of flies--how they grow, how they do not grow (after assuming the\r\nwinged state), and how they bite; for who has not endured the smart and\r\nsting of these dipterous Shylocks, that almost torment us out of our\r\nexistence while taking their drop of our heart\'s blood--may be welcome to\r\nour readers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 61. Head of the Mosquito.]\r\n\r\nThe Mosquito will be our first choice. As she leaps off from her light\r\nbark, the cast chrysalis skin of her early life beneath the waters, and\r\nsails away in the sunlight, her velvety wings fringed with silken hairs,\r\nand her neatly bodiced trim figure (though her nose is rather salient,\r\nconsidering that it is half as long as her entire body), present a\r\nbeauty and grace of form and movement quite unsurpassed by her dipterous\r\nallies. She draws near and softly alights upon the hand of the charmed\r\nbeholder, subdues her trumpeting notes, folds her wings noiselessly upon\r\nher back, daintily sets down one foot after the other, and with an\r\neagerness chastened by the most refined delicacy for the feelings of her\r\nvictim, and with the air of Velpeau redivivus, drives through crushed\r\nand bleeding capillaries, shrinking nerves and injured tissues, a\r\nmany-bladed lancet of marvellous fineness, of wonderful complexity and\r\nfitness. While engorging herself with our blood, we will examine under\r\nthe microscope the mosquito\'s mouth. The head (Fig. 61) is rounded, with\r\nthe two eyes occupying a large part of the surface, and nearly meeting\r\non the top of the head. Out of the forehead, so to speak, grow the long,\r\ndelicate, hairy antennm (_a_), and just below arises the long beak which\r\nconsists of the bristle-like maxill\xc3\xa6 (_mx_, with their palpi, _mp_) and\r\nmandibles (_m_), and the single hair-like labrum, these five\r\nbristle-like organs being laid in the hollowed labium (_l_). Thus massed\r\ninto a single awl-like beak, the mosquito, without any apparent effort,\r\nthrusts them all except the labium into the flesh. Her hind body may be\r\nseen tilling with the red blood, until it cries quits, and the insect\r\nwithdraws its sting and flies sluggishly away. In a moment the wounded\r\nparts itch slightly, though a very robust person may not notice the\r\nirritation, or a more delicate individual if asleep; though if weakened\r\nby disease, or if stung in a highly vascular and sensitive part, such as\r\nthe eyelid, the bite becomes really a serious matter. Multiply the\r\nmosquito a thousand fold, and one flees their attacks and avoids their\r\nhaunts as he would a nest of hornets. Early in spring the larva (Fig.\r\n62, A) of the mosquito may be found in pools and ditches. It remains at\r\nthe bottom feeding upon decaying matter (thus acting as a scavenger, and\r\nin this state doing great benefit in clearing swamps of miasms), until\r\nit rises to the surface for air, which it inhales through a single\r\nrespiratory tube (_c_) situated near the tail. When about to transform\r\ninto the pupa state, it contracts and enlarges anteriorly near the\r\nmiddle, the larval skin is thrown off, and the insect appears in quite a\r\ndifferent form (Fig. 62, a). The head and thorax are massed together,\r\nthe rudiments of the mouth parts and of the wings and legs being folded\r\nupon the breast, while there are two breathing tubes (_d_) situated upon\r\nthe back instead of the tail, which ends in two broad paddles (_a_); so\r\nthat it comes to the surface, head foremost instead of tail first, a\r\nposition according better with its increased age and experience in pond\r\nlife. In a few days the pupa skin is cast; the insect, availing itself\r\nof its old habiliments as a raft upon which to float while its body is\r\ndrying, grows lighter, and its wings expand for its marriage flight. The\r\nmales are beautiful, both physically and morally, as they do not bite;\r\ntheir manners are more retiring than those of their stronger minded\r\npartners, as they rarely enter our dwellings, and live unnoticed in the\r\nwoods. They may be easily distinguished from the females by their long\r\nmaxillary palpi, and their thick, bushy, feathered antenn\xc3\xa6. The female\r\nlays her elongated, oval eggs in a boat-shaped mass, which floats on the\r\nwater. A mosquito lives three or four weeks in the water before changing\r\nto the adult or winged stage. How many days they live in the latter\r\nstate we do not know.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 62. Larva and Pupa of the Mosquito.]\r\n\r\nOur readers will understand, then, that all flies, like our mosquito for\r\nexample, grow while in the larva and pupa state, _and after they acquire\r\nwings do not grow_, so that the small midges are not young mosquitoes,\r\nbut the adult winged forms of an entirely different species and genus of\r\nfly; and the myriads of small flies, commonly supposed to be the young\r\nof larger flies, are adult forms belonging to different species of\r\ndifferent genera, and perhaps of different families of the suborder of\r\nDiptera. The typical species of the genus Culex, to which the mosquito\r\nbelongs, is Culex pipiens, described by Linn\xc3\xa6us, and there are already\r\nover thirty North American species of this genus described in various\r\nworks. Few insects live in the sea, but along the coast of New England\r\na small, slender white larva (Fig. 63a, magnified, and head greatly\r\nenlarged; Fig. 64, pupa and fore foot of larva, showing the hooks),\r\nwhose body is no thicker than a knitting needle, lives between tides,\r\nand has even been dredged at a depth of over a hundred feet, which\r\ntransforms into a yellow mosquito-like fly (Fig. 65, with head of the\r\nfemale, magnified) which swarms in summer in immense numbers. I have\r\ncalled it provisionally Chironomus oceanicus, or Ocean gnat. The larv\xc3\xa6\r\nof other species have been found by Mr. S. I. Smith living at great\r\ndepths in our Northern lakes. These kinds of gnats are usually seen\r\nearly in spring hovering in swarms in mid air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 65. Ocean Gnat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 63. Larva of Ocean Gnat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 64. Pupa of Ocean Gnat.]\r\n\r\nThe strange fact has been discovered by Grimm, a Russian naturalist,\r\nthat the pupa of a feathered gnat is capable of laying eggs which\r\nproduce young during the summer time. Previous to this it had been\r\ndiscovered that a larva of a gnat (Fig. 66 _a_, eggs from which the\r\nyoung are produced) which lives under the bark of trees in Europe, also\r\nproduced young born alive.\r\n\r\nThe Hessian fly (Fig. 67, _a_, larva; _b_ pupa; _c_, stalk of wheat\r\ninjured by larv\xc3\xa6) and Wheat midge, which are allied to the mosquito, are\r\nbriefly referred to in the calendar, so that we pass over these to\r\nconsider another pest of our forests and prairies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 66. Viviparous gall larva.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 67. Hessian Fly and its Young.]\r\n\r\nThe Black fly is even a more formidable pest than the mosquito. In the\r\nnorthern, subarctic regions, it opposes a barrier against travel. The\r\nLabrador fisherman spends his summer on the sea shore, scarcely daring\r\nto penetrate the interior on account of the swarms of these flies.\r\nDuring a summer residence on this coast, we sailed up the Esquimaux\r\nriver for six or eight miles, spending a few hours at a house situated\r\non the bank. The day was warm and but little wind blowing, and the\r\nswarms of black flies were absolutely terrific. In vain we frantically\r\nwaved our net among them, allured by some rare moth; after making a few\r\ndesperate charges in the face of the thronging pests, we had to retire\r\nto the house, where the windows actually swarmed with them; but here\r\nthey would fly in our faces, crawl under one\'s clothes, where they even\r\nremain and bite in the night. The children in the house were sickly and\r\nworn by their unceasing torments; and the shaggy Newfoundland dogs whose\r\nthick coats would seem to be proof against their bites ran from their\r\nshelter beneath the bench and dashed into the river, their only retreat.\r\nIn cloudy weather, unlike the mosquito, the black fly disappears, only\r\nflying when the sun shines. The bite of the black fly is often severe,\r\nthe creature leaving a large clot of blood to mark the scene of its\r\nsurgical triumphs. Prof. E. T. Cox, State Geologist of Indiana, has sent\r\nus specimens of a much larger fly, which Baron Osten Sacken refers to\r\nthis genus, which is called on the prairies, where it is said to bite\r\nhorses to death, the Buffalo Gnat. Westwood states that an allied fly\r\n(Rhagio Columbaschensis) is one of the greatest scourges of man and\r\nbeast in Hungary, where it has been known to kill cattle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 68. Black fly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 69. Black Fly Larva.]\r\n\r\nThe Simulium molestum (Fig. 68, enlarged), as the black fly is called,\r\nlives during the larva state in the water. The larva of a Labrador\r\nspecies (Fig. 69, enlarged) which we found, is about a quarter of an\r\ninch long, and of the appearance here indicated. The pupa is also\r\naquatic, having long respiratory filaments attached to each side of the\r\nfront of the thorax. According to Westwood, "the posterior part of its\r\nbody is enclosed in a semioval membranous cocoon, which is at first\r\nformed by the larva, the anterior part of which is eaten away before\r\nchanging to a pupa, so as to be open in front. The imago is produced\r\nbeneath the surface of the water, its fine silky covering serving to\r\nrepel the action of the water."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 70. Mycetobia.]\r\n\r\nMultitudes of a long, slender, white worm may often be found living in\r\nthe dirt, and sour sap running from wounds in the elm tree. Two summers\r\nago we discovered some of these larv\xc3\xa6, and on rearing them found that\r\nthey were a species of Mycetobia (Fig. 70; _a_, larva; _b_, pupa). The\r\nlarva is remarkable for having the abdominal segments divided into two\r\nportions, the hinder much smaller than the anterior division. Its whole\r\nlength is a little over a third of an inch. The pup\xc3\xa6 were found sticking\r\nout in considerable numbers from the tree, being anchored by the little\r\nspines at the tail. The head is square, ending in two horns, and the\r\nbody is straight and covered with spines, especially towards the end of\r\nthe tail. They were a fifth of an inch in length. The last of June the\r\nflies appeared, somewhat resembling gnats, and about a line long. The\r\nworms continued to infest the tree for six weeks, the flies remaining\r\neither upon or near it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 71. Mouth Parts of Tabanus.]\r\n\r\nWe now come to that terror of our equine friends, the Horse fly, Gad, or\r\nBreeze fly. In its larval state, some species live in water, and in damp\r\nplaces under stones and pieces of wood, and others in the earth away\r\nfrom water, where they feed on animal, and, probably, on decaying\r\nmatter. Mr. B. D. Walsh found an aquatic larva of this genus, which,\r\nwithin a short time, devoured eleven water snails. Thus at this stage of\r\nexistence, this fly, often so destructive, even at times killing our\r\nhorses, is beneficial. During the hotter parts of summer, and when the\r\nsun is shining brightly, thousands of these Horse flies appear on our\r\nmarshes and inland prairies. There are many different kinds, over one\r\nhundred species of the genus Tabanus alone, living in North America. Our\r\nmost common species is the "Green head," or Tabanus lineola. When about\r\nto bite, it settles quietly down upon the hand, face or foot, it matters\r\nnot which, and thrusts its formidable lancet-like jaws deep into the\r\nflesh. Its bite is very painful, as we can testify from personal\r\nexperience. We were told during the last summer that a horse, which\r\nstood fastened to a tree in a field near the marshes at Rowley, Mass.,\r\nwas bitten to death by these Green heads; and it is known that horses\r\nand cattle are occasionally killed by their repeated harassing bites. In\r\ncloudy weather they do not fly, and they perish on the cool frosty\r\nnights of September. The Timb, or Tsetze fly, is a species of this group\r\nof flies, and while it does not attack man, plagues to death, and is\r\nsaid to poison by its bite, the cattle in certain districts of the\r\ninterior of Africa, thus almost barring out explorers. On comparing the\r\nmouth-parts of the Horse fly (Fig. 71, mouth of T. lineola), we have all\r\nthe parts seen in the mosquito, but greatly modified. Like the mosquito,\r\nthe females alone bite, the male Horse fly being harmless, and\r\nfrequenting flowers, living upon their sweets. The labrum (_lb_),\r\nmandibles (_m_) and maxill\xc3\xa6 (_mx_), are short, stiff and lancet-like,\r\nand the maxillary palpi (_mp_; _a_, the five terminal joints of the\r\nantenn\xc3\xa6) are large, stout, and two-jointed. While the jaws (both maxill\xc3\xa6\r\nand mandibles) are thrust into the flesh, the tongue (_l_) spreads\r\naround the tube thus formed by the lancets, and pumps up the blood\r\nflowing from the wound, by aid of the sucking stomach, or crop, being a\r\nsac appended to the throat. Other Gad flies, but much smaller, though as\r\nannoying to us in woods and fields, are the species of Golden eyed\r\nflies, Chrysops, which fly and buzz interminably about our ears, often\r\ntaking a sudden nip. They plague cattle, settling upon them and drawing\r\ntheir blood at their leisure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 72. Carpet Fly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 73. Carpet Worm.]\r\n\r\nWe turn to a comparatively unknown insect, which has occasionally\r\nexcited some distrust in the minds of housekeepers. It is the carpet\r\nfly, Scenopinus pallipes (Fig. 72), which, in the larva state, is found\r\nunder carpets, on which it is said to feed. The worm (Fig. 73) has a\r\nlong, white, cylindrical body, divided into twelve segments, exclusive\r\nof the head, while the first eight abdominal segments are divided by a\r\ntransverse suture, so that there appear to be seventeen abdominal\r\nsegments, the sutures appearing too distinct in the cut. Mr. F. G.\r\nSanborn has reared the fly, here figured, from the worm. The larva also\r\nlives in rotten wood; it is too scarce ever to prove very destructive in\r\nhouses. Either this or a similar fly was once found, we are told by a\r\nscientific friend, in great numbers in a "rat" used in dressing a young\r\nlady\'s hair; the worms were living upon the hair stuffing.\r\n\r\nOne of the most puzzling objects to the collector of shells or insects,\r\nis the almost spherical larva of Microdon globosus (Fig. 74). It is\r\nflattened and smooth beneath and seems to adhere to the under side of\r\nstones, where it might be mistaken for a snail.\r\n\r\nThe Syrphus fly, or Aphis eater, deserves more than the passing notice\r\nwhich we bestow upon it. The maggot (Fig. 75, in the act of devouring an\r\nAphis) is to be sought for established in a group of plant lice (Aphis),\r\nwhich it seizes by means of the long extensible front part of the body.\r\nThe adult fly (Fig. 76) is gayly spotted and banded with yellow,\r\nresembling closely a wasp. It frequents flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 74. Microdon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 75. Syrphus Larva.] 76. Syrphus Fly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 77. Larva of Rat-tailed Fly. 78. Rat-tailed Fly and its\r\nPupa.]\r\n\r\nThe singular rat-tailed pupa-case of Eristalis (Fig. 77) lives in water,\r\nand when in want of air, protrudes its long respiratory tube out into\r\nthe air. We present the figure of an allied fly, Merodon Bardus (Fig.\r\n78; _a_, puparium, natural size). We will not describe at length the\r\nfly, as the admirable drawings of Mr. Emerton cannot fail to render it\r\neasily recognizable. The larva is much like the puparium or pupa case,\r\nhere figured, which closely resembles that of Eristalis, in possessing\r\nalong respiratory filament, showing that the maggot undoubtedly lives in\r\nthe water, and when desirous of breathing, protrudes the tube out of the\r\nwater, thus drawing in air enough to fill its internal respiratory tubes\r\n(trache\xc3\xa6). The Merodon Narcissa probably lives in the soil, or in rotten\r\nwood, as the pupa-case has no respiratory tube, having instead a very\r\nshort, sessile, truncated tube, scarcely as long as it is thick. The\r\ncase itself is cylindrical, and rounded alike at each end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 79. Human Bot Worm.]\r\n\r\nWe now come to the Bot flies, which are among the most extraordinary, in\r\ntheir habits, of all insects. The history of the Bot flies is in brief\r\nthus. The adult two-winged fly lays its eggs on the exterior of the\r\nanimal to be infested. They are conveyed into the interior of the host,\r\nwhere they hatch, and the worm or maggot lives by sucking in the\r\npurulent matter, caused by the irritation set up by its presence in its\r\nhost; or else the worm itself, after hatching, bores under the skin.\r\nWhen fully grown, it quits the body and finishes its transformations to\r\nthe fly-state under ground. Many quadrupeds, from mice, squirrels, and\r\nrabbits, up to the ox, horse, and even the rhinoceros, suffer from their\r\nattacks, while man himself is not exempt. The body of the adult fly is\r\nstout and hairy, and it is easily recognized by having the opening of\r\nthe mouth very small, the mouth-parts being very rudimentary. The larv\xc3\xa6\r\nare, in general, thick, fleshy, footless grubs, consisting of eleven\r\nsegments, exclusive of the head, which are covered with rows of spines\r\nand tubercles, by which they move about within the body, thus irritating\r\nthe animals in which they take up their abode. The breathing pores\r\n(stigmata) open in a scaly plate at the posterior end of the body. The\r\nmouth-parts (mandibles, etc.) of the subcutaneous larv\xc3\xa6 consist of\r\nfleshy tubercles, while in those species which live in the stomachs and\r\nfrontal sinuses of their host, they are armed with horny hooks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 80. Horse Bot Fly.]\r\n\r\nThe larv\xc3\xa6 attain their full size after moulting twice. Just before\r\nassuming the pupa state, the maggot leaves its peculiar dwelling place,\r\ndescends into the ground and there becomes a pupa, though retaining its\r\nlarval skin, which serves as a protection to it, whence it is called a\r\n"puparium."\r\n\r\nSeveral well-authenticated instances are on record of a species of bot\r\nfly inhabiting the body of man, in Central and South America, producing\r\npainful tumors under the skin of the arm, legs and abdomen. It is still\r\nunder dispute whether this human bot fly is a true or accidental\r\nparasite, the more probable opinion being that its proper host is the\r\nmonkey or dog. In Cayenne, this revolting grub is called the Ver macaque\r\n(Fig. 79); in Para, Ura; in Costa Rica, Torcel; and in New Granada,\r\nGusano peludo, or Nuche. The Dermatobia noxialis, supposed to be the Ver\r\nmoyocuil of the inhabitants of Mexico and New Granada, lives beneath the\r\nskin of the dog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 81. Bot Fly of Ox, and Larva.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 82. Sheep Bot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 83. Skin Bot Fly.]\r\n\r\nThe Bot fly of the horse, (Gastrophilus equi, Fig. 80 and larva), is\r\npale yellowish, spotted with red, with short, grayish, yellow hairs, and\r\nthe wings are banded with reddish. She lays her eggs upon the knees of\r\nthe horse. They are conveyed into the stomach, where the larva lives\r\nfrom May until October, and when full grown are found hanging by their\r\nmouth hooks on the edge of the rectum of the horse, whence they are\r\ncarried out in the excrement. The pupa state lasts for thirty or forty\r\ndays, and the perfect fly appears the next season, from June until\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nThe Bot fly of the ox (Hypoderma bovis, Fig. 81, and larva), is black\r\nand densely hairy, and the thorax is banded with yellow and white. The\r\nlarva is found during the month of May, and also in summer, living in\r\ntumors on the backs of cattle. When fully grown, which is generally in\r\nJuly, they make their way out and fall to the ground, and live in the\r\npupa-case from twenty-six to thirty days, the fly appearing from May\r\nuntil September. It is found all over the world. The Oestrus ovis, or\r\nsheep Bot fly (Fig. 82, larva), is of a dirty ash color. The abdomen is\r\nmarbled with yellowish and white flecks, and is hairy at the end. This\r\nspecies of Bot fly is larviparous, i.e., the eggs are hatched within the\r\nbody of the mother, the larv\xc3\xa6 being produced alive. M. F. Brauer, of\r\nVienna, the author of the most thorough work we have on these flies,\r\ntells me that he knows of but one other Bot fly (a species of\r\nCephanomyia) which produces living larv\xc3\xa6 instead of eggs. The eggs of\r\ncertain other species of Bot flies do not hatch until three or four days\r\nafter they are laid. The larv\xc3\xa6 of the sheep Bot fly live, during April,\r\nMay and June, in the frontal sinus of the sheep, and also in the nasal\r\ncavity, whence they fall to the ground when fully grown. In twenty-four\r\nhours they change to pup\xc3\xa6, and the flies appear during the summer.\r\n\r\nWe also figure the Cuterebra buccata (Fig. 83; _a_, side view,) which\r\nresembles in the larval state the ox Bot fly. Its habits are not known,\r\nthough the young of other species infest the opossum, squirrel, hare,\r\netc., living in subcutaneous tumors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The banded Lithacodes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE FLY AND ITS ALLIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 84. Mouth-parts of the House fly.]\r\n\r\nThe common House fly, Musca domestica, scarcely needs an introduction to\r\nany one of our readers, and its countenance is so well known that we\r\nneed not present a portrait here. But a study of the proboscis of the\r\nfly reveals a wonderful adaptability of the mouth-parts of this insect\r\nto their uses. We have already noticed the most perfect condition of\r\nthese parts as seen in the horse fly. In the proboscis of the house fly\r\nthe hard parts are obsolete, and instead we have a fleshy tongue like\r\norgan (Fig. 84), bent up beneath the head when at rest. The maxill\xc3\xa6 are\r\nminute, their palpi (_mp_) being single-jointed, and the mandibles (_m_)\r\nare comparatively useless, being very short and small, compared with the\r\nlancet-like jaws of the mosquito or horse fly. But the structure of the\r\ntongue itself (labium, l) is most curious. When the fly settles upon a\r\nlump of sugar or other sweet object, it unbends its tongue, extends it,\r\nand the broad knob-like end divides into two broad, flat, muscular\r\nleaves (_l_), which thus present a sucker-like surface, with which the\r\nfly laps up liquid sweets. These two leaves are supported upon a\r\nframework of tracheal tubes. In the cut given above, Mr. Emerton has\r\nfaithfully represented these modified trach\xc3\xa6, which end in hairs\r\nprojecting externally. Thus the inside of this broad fleshy expansion\r\nis rough like a rasp, and as Newport states, "is easily employed by the\r\ninsect in scraping or tearing delicate surfaces. It is by means of this\r\ncurious structure that the busy house fly occasions much mischief to the\r\ncovers of our books, by scraping off the albuminous polish, and leaving\r\ntracings of its depredations in the soiled and spotted appearance which\r\nit occasions on them. It is by means of these also that it teases us in\r\nthe heat of summer, when it alights on the hand or face to sip the\r\nperspiration as it exudes from, and is condensed upon, the skin."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 85. Larva; _a_, Pupa-case of House fly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 86. Larva of Flesh fly.]\r\n\r\nEvery one notices that house flies are most abundant around barns in\r\nAugust and September, and it is in the ordure of stables that the early\r\nstages of this insect are passed. No one has traced the transformations\r\nof this fly in our country, but we copy from Bouch\xc3\xa9\'s work on the\r\ntransformations of insects, the rather rude figures of the larva (Fig.\r\n85), and pupa-case (_a_) of the Musca domestica of Europe, which is\r\nsupposed to be our species. Bouch\xc3\xa9 states that the larva is cylindrical,\r\nrounded posteriorly, smooth and shining, fleshy, and yellowish white,\r\nand four lines long. The pupa-case, or puparium, is dark reddish-brown,\r\nand three lines in length. It remains in the pupa state from eight to\r\nfourteen days. In Europe it is preyed upon by minute ichneumon flies\r\n(Chalcids). The flesh fly, Musca C\xc3\xa6sar, or the Blue-bottle fly, feeds\r\nupon decaying animal matter. Its larva (Fig. 86) is long, cylindrical,\r\nthe head being pointed, and the body conical, the posterior end being\r\nsquarely docked. The larva of a Sargus-like form which feeds on offal,\r\ntransforms into a flattened pupa-case (Fig. 87), provided with long,\r\nscattered hairs. The House fly disappears in autumn, at the approach of\r\ncold weather, though a few individuals pass through the winter,\r\nhibernating in houses, and when the rooms are heated may often be seen\r\nflying on the windows. Other species fly early in March, on warm days,\r\nhaving hibernated under leaves, and the bark of trees, moss, etc. An\r\nallied species, the M. vomitoria, is the Meat fly. Closely allied are\r\nthe parasitic species of Tachina, which live within the bodies of\r\ncaterpillars and other insects, and are among the most beneficial of\r\ninsects, as they prey on thousands of injurious caterpillars. Another\r\nfly of this Muscid group, the Idia Bigoti, according to Coquerel and\r\nMondiere, produces in the natives of Senegal, hard, red, fluctuating\r\ntumors, in which the larva resides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 87. Larva of a Sargus-like fly.]\r\n\r\nMany of the smaller Muscids mine leaves, running galleries within the\r\nleaf, or burrowing in seeds or under the bark of plants. We have often\r\nnoticed blister-like swellings on the bark of the willow, which are\r\noccasioned by a cylindrical, short, fleshy larva (Fig. 88_a_, much\r\nenlarged), about a line in length, which changes to a pupa within the\r\nold larval skin, assuming the form here represented (Fig. 88_b_), and\r\nabout the last of June changes to a small black fly (Fig. 88), which\r\nBaron Osten Sacken refers doubtfully to the genus Lonch\xc3\xa6a.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 86. Willow Blister fly.]\r\n\r\nThe Apple midge frequently does great mischief to apples after they are\r\ngathered. Mr. F. G. Sanborn states that nine-tenths of the apple crop in\r\nWrentham, Mass., were destroyed by a fly supposed to be the Molobrus\r\nmali, or Apple midge, described by Dr. Fitch. "The eggs were supposed to\r\nhave been laid in fresh apples, in the holes made by the Coddling moth\r\n(Carpocapsa pomonella), whence the larv\xc3\xa6 penetrated into all parts of\r\nthe apple, working small cylindrical burrows about one-sixteenth of an\r\ninch in diameter." Mr. W. C. Fish has also sent me, from Sandwich,\r\nMass., specimens of another kind of apple worm, which he writes has been\r\nvery common in Barnstable county. "It attacks mostly the earlier\r\nvarieties, seeming to have a particular fondness for the old fashioned\r\nSummer, or High-top Sweet. The larv\xc3\xa6 (Fig. 89 _a_) enter the fruit\r\nusually where it has been bored by the Apple worm (Carpocapsa), not\r\nuncommonly through the crescent-like puncture of the curculio, and\r\nsometimes through the calyx, when it has not been troubled by other\r\ninsects. Many of them arrive at maturity in August, and the fly soon\r\nappears, successive generations of the maggots following until cold\r\nweather. I have frequently found the pup\xc3\xa6 in the bottom of barrels in a\r\ncellar in the winter, and the flies appear in the spring. In the early\r\napples, the larv\xc3\xa6 work about in every direction. If there be several in\r\nan apple, they make it unfit for use. Apples that appear perfectly sound\r\nwhen taken from the tree, will sometimes, if kept, be all alive with\r\nthem in a few weeks." Baron Osten Sacken informs me that it is a\r\nDrosophila, "the species of which live in putrescent vegetable matter,\r\nespecially fruits."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 89. Apple Worm and its Larva.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 90. Parent of the Cheese Maggot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 91. Pupa case of Wine-fly.]\r\n\r\nAn allied fly is the parent of the cheese maggot. The fly itself\r\n(Piophila casei, Fig. 90) is black, with metallic green reflections, and\r\nthe legs are dark and paler at the knee-joints, the middle and hind pair\r\nof tarsi being dark honey yellow. The Wine fly is also a Piophila, and\r\nlives the life of a perpetual toper in old wine casks, and partially\r\nemptied beer, cider and wine bottles, where, with its pupa-case (Fig.\r\n91), it may be found floating dead in its favorite beverage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 92. Bird Tick.]\r\n\r\nWe now come to the more degraded forms of flies which live parasitically\r\non various animals. We figure, from a specimen in the Museum of the\r\nPeabody Academy of Science, the Bird tick (Ornithomyia, Fig. 92), which\r\nlives upon the Great Horned Owl. Its body is much flattened, adapted for\r\nits life under the feathers, where it gorges itself with the blood of\r\nits host.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 93. The Horse Tick.]\r\n\r\nHere belongs also the Horse tick (Hippobosca equina, Fig. 93). It is\r\nabout the size of the house fly, being black, with yellow spots on the\r\nthorax. Verrill[4] says that "it attacks by preference those parts where\r\nthe hair is thinnest and the skin softest, especially under the belly\r\nand between the hind legs. Its bite causes severe pain, and will\r\nirritate the gentlest horses, often rendering them almost unmanageable,\r\nand causing them to kick dangerously. When found, they cling so firmly\r\nas to be removed with some difficulty, and they are so tough as not to\r\nbe readily crushed. If one escapes when captured, it will instantly\r\nreturn to the horse, or, perchance, to the head of its captor, where it\r\nis an undesirable guest. Another species sometimes infests the ox."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 94. Sheep Tick.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 95. Bat Tick.]\r\n\r\nIn the wingless Sheep tick (Melophagus ovinus, Fig. 94, with the\r\npupa-case on the left), the body is wingless and very hairy, and the\r\nproboscis is very long. The young are developed within the body of the\r\nparent, until they attain the pupa state, when she deposits the pupa\r\ncase, which is nearly half as large as her abdomen. Other genera are\r\nparasitic on bats; among them are the singular spider-like Bat ticks\r\n(Nycteribia, Fig. 95), which have small bodies and enormous legs, and\r\nare either blind, or provided with four simple eyes. They are of small\r\nsize, being only a line or two in length. Such degraded forms of Diptera\r\nhave a remarkable resemblance to the spiders, mites, ticks, etc. The\r\nreader should compare the Nycteribia with the young six-footed moose\r\ntick figured farther on. Another spider-like fly is the Chionea valga\r\n(Fig. 96; and 97, larva of the European species), which is a degraded\r\nTipula, The latter genus standing near the head of the Diptera. The\r\nChionea, according to Harris, lives in its early, stages in the ground\r\nlike many other gnats, and is found early in the spring, sometimes\r\ncrawling over the snow. We have also figured and mentioned previously\r\n(page 41) the Bee louse, Braula, another wingless spider-like fly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 96. Spider fly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 97. Larva of Spider fly.]\r\n\r\nThe Flea is also a wingless fly, and is probably, as has been suggested\r\nby an eminent entomologist, as Baron Osten Sacken informs us, a degraded\r\ngenus of the family to which Mycetobia belongs. Its transformations are\r\nvery unlike those of the fly ticks, and agree closely with the early\r\nstages of Mycetophila, one of the Tipulid family. In its adult condition\r\nthe flea combines the characters of the Diptera, with certain features\r\nof the grasshoppers and cockroaches, and the bugs. The body of the flea\r\n(Fig. 98, greatly magnified; _a_, antenn\xc3\xa6; _b_, maxill\xc3\xa6, and their\r\npalpi, _c_; _d_, mandibles; the latter, with the labium, which is not\r\nshown in the figure, forming the acute beak) is much compressed, and\r\nthere are minute wing-pads, instead of wings, present in some species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 98. Flea, magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 99. Larva of Flea.]\r\n\r\nDr. G. A. Perkins, of Salem, has succeeded in rearing in considerable\r\nnumbers from the eggs, the larv\xc3\xa6 of this flea. The larv\xc3\xa6 (Fig. 99, much\r\nenlarged; _a_, antenna; _b_, the terminal segments of the abdomen), when\r\nhatched, are half a line in length. The body is long, cylindrical, and\r\npure white, with thirteen segments exclusive of the head, and provided\r\nwith rather long hairs. It is very active in its movements, and lives on\r\nblood clots, remaining on unswept floors of out-houses, or in the straw\r\nor bed of the animals they infest. In six days after the eggs are laid\r\nthe larv\xc3\xa6 appear, and in a few days after leaving the egg they mature,\r\nspin a rude cocoon, and change to pup\xc3\xa6, and the perfect insects appear\r\nin about ten days. A good authority states that the human flea does not\r\nexist in America. We never saw a specimen in this country.\r\n\r\nA practical point is how to rid dogs of fleas. As a preventive measure,\r\nwe would suggest the frequent sweeping and cleansing of the floors of\r\ntheir kennels, and renewing the straw or chips composing their\r\nbeds,--chips being the best material for them to sleep upon. Flea\r\nafflicted dogs should be washed every few days in strong soapsuds, or\r\nweak tobacco or petroleum water.\r\n\r\nA writer in "Science-Gossip" recommends the "use of the Persian Insect\r\nDestroyer, one package of which suffices for a good sized dog. The\r\npowder should be well rubbed in all over the skin, or the dog, if small,\r\ncan be put into a bag previously dusted with the powder; in either case\r\nthe dog should be washed soon after."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 100. Chique.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious insect torments of the tropics of America is the\r\nSarcopsylla penetrans, called by the natives the Jigger, Chigoe, Bicho,\r\nChique, or Pique (Fig. 100, enlarged; a, gravid female, natural size).\r\nThe female, during the dry season, bores into the feet of the natives,\r\nthe operation requiring but a quarter of an hour, usually penetrating\r\nunder the nails, and lives there until her body becomes distended with\r\neggs, the hind-body swelling out to the size of a pea; her presence\r\noften causes distressing sores. The Chigoe lays about sixty eggs,\r\ndepositing them in a sort of sac on each side of the external opening of\r\nthe oviduct. The young develop and feed upon the swollen body of the\r\nparent flea until they mature, when they leave the body of their host\r\nand escape to the ground. The best preventive is cleanliness and the\r\nconstant wearing of shoes or slippers when in the house, and of boots\r\nwhen out of doors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Willow Gall Fly.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BORERS OF OUR SHADE TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no way can the good taste and public spirit of our citizens be better\r\nshown than in the planting of shade trees. Regarded simply from a\r\ncommercial point of view one cannot make a more paying investment than\r\nsetting out an oak, elm, maple or other shade tree about his premises.\r\nTo a second generation it becomes a precious heirloom, and the planter\r\nis duly held in remembrance for those finer qualities of heart and head,\r\nand the wise forethought which prompted a deed simple and natural, but a\r\ndeed too often undone. What an increased value does a fine avenue of\r\nshade trees give to real estate in a city? And in the country the single\r\nstately elm rising gracefully and benignantly over the wayside cottage,\r\nyear after year like a guardian angel sending down its blessings of\r\nshade, moisture and coolness in times of drought, and shelter from the\r\npitiless storm, recalls the tenderest associations of generation after\r\ngeneration that go from the old homestead.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the tree, or a number of them, sicken and die, or linger\r\nout a miserable existence, and we naturally after failing to ascribe the\r\ncause to bad soil, want of moisture or adverse atmospheric agencies,\r\nconclude that the tree is infested with insects, especially if the bark\r\nin certain places seems diseased. Often the disease is in streets\r\nlighted by gas, attributed to the leakage of the gas. Such a case has\r\ncome up recently at Morristown, New Jersey. An elm was killed by the Elm\r\nborer (Compsidea tridentata), and the owner was on the point of suing\r\nthe Gas Company for the loss of the tree from the supposed leakage of a\r\ngas pipe. While the matter was in dispute, a gentleman of that city took\r\nthe pains to peel off a piece of the bark and found, as he wrote me,\r\n"great numbers of the larv\xc3\xa6 of this beetle in the bark and between the\r\nbark and the wood, while the latter is \'tattooed\' with sinuous grooves\r\nin every direction and the tree is completely girdled by them in some\r\nplaces. There are three different sizes of the larv\xc3\xa6, evidently one, two\r\nand three years old, or more properly six, eighteen and thirty months\r\nold." The tree had to be cut down.\r\n\r\nDr. Harris, in his "Treatise on Injurious Insects," gives an account of\r\nthe ravages of this insect, which we quote: "On the 19th of June, 1846,\r\nTheophilus Parsons, Esq., sent me some fragments of bark and insects\r\nwhich were taken by Mr. J. Richardson from the decaying elms on Boston\r\nCommon, and among the insects I recognized a pair of these beetles in a\r\nliving state. The trees were found to have suffered terribly from the\r\nravages of these insects. Several of them had already been cut down, as\r\npast recovery; others were in a dying state, and nearly all of them were\r\nmore or less affected with disease or premature decay. Their bark was\r\nperforated, to the height of thirty feet from the ground, with numerous\r\nholes, through which insects had escaped; and large pieces had become so\r\nloose, by the undermining of the grubs, as to yield to slight efforts,\r\nand come off in flakes. The inner bark was filled with burrows of the\r\ngrubs, great numbers of which, in various stages of growth, together\r\nwith some in the pupa state, were found therein; and even the surface of\r\nthe wood, in many cases, was furrowed with their irregular tracks. Very\r\nrarely did they seem to have penetrated far into the wood itself; but\r\ntheir operations were mostly confined to the inner layers of the bark,\r\nwhich thereby became loosened from the wood beneath. The grubs rarely\r\nexceed three-quarters of an inch in length. They have no feet, and they\r\nresemble the larv\xc3\xa6 of other species of Saperda, except in being rather\r\nmore flattened. They appear to complete their transformations in the\r\nthird year of their existence.\r\n\r\n"The beetles probably leave their holes in the bark during the month of\r\nJune and in the beginning of July, for, in the course of thirty years, I\r\nhave repeatedly taken them at various dates, from the fifth of June to\r\nthe tenth of July. It is evident, from the nature and extent of their\r\ndepredations, that these insects have alarmingly hastened the decay of\r\nthe elm trees on Boston Mall and Common, and that they now threaten\r\ntheir entire destruction. Other causes, however, have probably\r\ncontributed to the same end. It will be remembered that these trees\r\nhave greatly suffered, in past times, from the ravages of canker-worms.\r\nMoreover, the impenetrable state of the surface soil, the exhausted\r\ncondition of the subsoil, and the deprivation of all benefit from the\r\ndecomposition of accumulated leaves, which, in a state of nature, the\r\ntrees would have enjoyed, but which a regard for neatness has\r\nindustriously removed, have doubtless had no small influence in\r\ndiminishing the vigor of the trees, and thus made them fall\r\nunresistingly a prey to insect devourers. The plan of this work\r\nprecludes a more full consideration of these and other topics connected\r\nwith the growth and decay of these trees; and I can only add, that it\r\nmay be prudent to cut down and burn all that are much infested by the\r\nborers."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 101. Elm Tree Beetle.]\r\n\r\nThe Three-toothed Compsidea (Fig. 101), is a rather flat-bodied, dark\r\nbrown beetle, with a rusty red curved line behind the eyes, two stripes\r\non the thorax, and a three-toothed stripe on the outer edge of each wing\r\ncover. It is about one-half an inch in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 102. Elm Tree Borer.]\r\n\r\nThe larva (Fig. 102) is white, subcylindrical, a little flattened, with\r\nthe lateral fold of the body rather prominent; the end of the body is\r\nflattened, obtuse, and nearly as wide at the end as at the first\r\nabdominal ring. The head is one-half as wide as the prothoracic ring,\r\nbeing rather large. The prothoracic ring, or segment just behind the\r\nhead, is transversely oblong, being twice as broad as long; there is a\r\npale dorsal corneous transversely oblong shield, being about two-thirds\r\nas long as wide, and nearly as long as the four succeeding segments;\r\nthis plate is smooth, except on the posterior half, which is rough, with\r\nthe front edge irregular and not extending far down the sides. Fine\r\nhairs arise from the front edge and side of the plate, and similar hairs\r\nare scattered over the body and especially around the end. On the upper\r\nside of each segment is a transversely oblong ovate roughened area, with\r\nthe front edge slightly convex, and the hinder slightly arcuate. On the\r\nunder side of each segment are similar rough horny plates, but arcuate\r\nin front, with the hinder edge straight.\r\n\r\nIt differs from the larva of the Linden tree borer (Saperda vestita) in\r\nthe body being shorter, broader, more hairy, with the tip of the abdomen\r\nflatter and more hairy. The prothoracic segment is broader and flatter,\r\nand the rough portion of the dorsal plates is larger and less\r\ntranversely ovate. The structure of the head shows that its generic\r\ndistinctness from Saperda is well founded, as the head is smaller and\r\nflatter, the clypeus being twice as large, and the labrum broad and\r\nshort, while in S. vestita it is longer than broad. The mandibles are\r\nmuch longer and slenderer, and the antenn\xc3\xa6 are much smaller than in S.\r\nvestita.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 103. Linden Tree Beetle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 104. Linden Tree Borer.]\r\n\r\nThe Linden tree borer (Fig. 103) is a greenish snuff-yellow beetle, with\r\nsix black spots near the middle of the back; and it is about\r\neight-tenths of an inch in length, though often smaller. The beetles,\r\naccording to Dr. Paul Swift, as quoted by Dr. Harris, were found (in\r\nPhiladelphia) upon the small branches and leaves on the 28th day of May,\r\nand it is said that they come out as early as the first of the month,\r\nand continue to make their way through the back of the trunk and large\r\nbranches during the whole of the warm season. They immediately fly into\r\nthe top of the tree, and there feed upon the epidermis of the tender\r\ntwigs, and the petioles of the leaves, often wholly denuding the latter,\r\nand causing the leaves to fall. They deposit their eggs, two or three in\r\na place, upon the trunk or branches especially about the forks, making\r\nslight incisions or punctures for their reception with their strong\r\njaws. As many as ninety eggs have been taken from a single beetle. The\r\ngrubs (Fig. 104, _e_; _a_, enlarged view of the head seen from above;\r\n_b_, the under view of the same: _c_, side view, and _d_, two rings of\r\nthe body enlarged), hatched from these eggs, undermine the bark to the\r\nextent of six or eight inches, in sinuous channels, or penetrate the\r\nsolid wood an equal distance. It is supposed that three years are\r\nrequired to mature the insect. Various expedients have been tried to\r\narrest their course, but without effect. A stream, thrown into the tops\r\nof trees from the hydrant, is often used with good success to dislodge\r\nother insects; but the borer-beetles, when thus disturbed, take wing and\r\nhover over the trees till all is quiet, and then alight and go to work\r\nagain. The trunks and branches of some of the trees have been washed\r\nover with various preparations without benefit. Boring the trunk near\r\nthe ground and putting in sulphur and other drugs, and plugging, have\r\nbeen tried with as little effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 105. Poplar Tree Borer.]\r\n\r\nThe city of Philadelphia has suffered grievously from this borer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 106. Broad-necked Prionus.]\r\n\r\nDr. Swift remarks, in 1844, that "the trees in Washington and\r\nIndependence Squares were first observed to have been attacked about\r\nseven years ago. Within two years it has been found necessary to cut\r\ndown forty-seven European lindens in the former square alone, where\r\nthere now remain only a few American lindens, and these a good deal\r\neaten." In New England this beetle should be looked for during the first\r\nhalf of June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 107. Larva of the Plain Saperda.]\r\n\r\nThe Poplar tree is infested by an other species of Saperda (S.\r\ncalcarata). This is a much larger beetle than those above mentioned,\r\nbeing an inch or a little more in length. It is grey, irregularly\r\nstriped, with ochre, and the wing-covers end in a sharp point. The grub\r\n(Fig. 105 _a_; _b_, top view of the head; _e_, under side) is about two\r\ninches long and whitish yellow. It has, with that of the Broad-necked\r\nPrionus (P. laticollis of Drury, Fig. 106, adult and pupa), as Harris\r\nstates, "almost entirely destroyed the Lombardy poplar in this vicinity"\r\n(Boston). It bores in the trunks, and the beetle flies by night in\r\nAugust and September. We also figure the larva of another borer (Fig.\r\n107 _c_; _a_, top view of the head; _b_, under side; _e_, dorsal view of\r\nan abdominal segment; _d_, end of the body, showing its peculiar form),\r\nthe Saperda inornata of Say, the beetle of which is black, with ash gray\r\nhairs, and without spines on the wing-covers. It is much smaller than\r\nany of the foregoing species, being nine-twentieths of an inch in\r\nlength. Its habits are not known. We also figure the Locust and Hickory\r\nborer (Fig. 108; _a_, larva; _b_, pupa), which has swept off the locust\r\ntree from New England. The beautiful yellow banded beetles are very\r\nabundant on the flowers of the golden rod in September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 108. Locust Borer.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The External and Internal Parasites of Man and Domestic\r\nAnimals. By Prof. A. E. Verrill, 1870.

Not only is the mere mention of the creature\'s name of\r\nwhich we are to speak tabooed and avoided by the refined and polite, but\r\nthe creature itself has become extinct and banished from the society of\r\nthe good and respectable. Indeed under such happy auspices do a large\r\nproportion of the civilized world now live that their knowledge of the\r\nhabits and form of a louse may be represented by a blank. Not so with\r\nsome of their great-great-grandfathers and grandmothers, if history,\r\nsacred and profane, poetry,[5] and the annals of literature testify\r\naright; for it is comparatively a recent fact in history that the louse\r\nhas awakened to find himself an outcast and an alien. Among savage\r\nnations of all climes, some of which have been dignified with the apt,\r\nthough high sounding name of Phthiriophagi, and among the Chinese and\r\nother semi-civilized peoples, these lords of the soil still flourish\r\nwith a luxuriance and rankness of growth that never diminishes, so that\r\nwe may say without exaggeration that certain mental traits and fleshly\r\nappetites induced by their consumption as an article of food may have\r\nbeen created, while a separate niche in our anthropological museums is\r\nreserved for the instruments of warfare, both offensive and defensive,\r\nused by their phthiriophagous hunters. Then have we not in the very\r\ncentres of civilization the poor and degraded, which are most faithfully\r\nattended lay these revolting satellites!\r\n\r\nBut bantering aside, there is no more engaging subject to the naturalist\r\nthan that of animal parasites. Consider the great proportion of animals\r\nthat gain their livelihood by stealing that of others. While a large\r\nproportion of plants are more or less parasitic, they gain, thereby in\r\ninterest to the botanist, and many of them are eagerly sought as the\r\nchoicest ornaments of our conservatories. Not so with their zo\xc3\xb6logical\r\nconfr\xc3\xa9res. All that is repulsive and uncanny is associated with them,\r\nand those who study them, though perhaps among the keenest intellects\r\nand most industrious observers, speak of them without the limits of\r\ntheir own circle in subdued whispers or under a protest, and their works\r\nfall under the eyes of the scantiest few. But the study of animal\r\nparasites has opened up new fields of research, all bearing most\r\nintimately on those two questions that ever incite the naturalist to the\r\nmost laborious and untiring diligence--what is life and its origin? The\r\nsubjects of the alternation of generations, or parthenogenesis, of\r\nembryology and biology, owe their great advance, in large degree, to the\r\nstudy of such animals as are parasitic, and the question whether the\r\norigin of species be due to creation by the action of secondary laws or\r\nnot, will be largely met and answered by the study of the varied\r\nmetamorphoses and modes of growth, the peculiar modification of organs\r\nthat adapt them to their strange modes of life, and the consequent\r\nvariation in specific characters so remarkably characteristic of those\r\nanimals living parasitically upon others.[6]\r\n\r\nWith these considerations in view surely a serious, thoughtful, and\r\nthorough study of the louse, in all its varieties and species, is\r\nneither belittling nor degrading, nor a waste of time. We venture to\r\nsay, moreover, that more light will be thrown on the classification and\r\nmorphology of insects by the study of the parasitic species, and other\r\ndegraded, wingless forms that do not always live parasitically,\r\nespecially of their embryology and changes after leaving the egg, than\r\nby years of study of the more highly developed insects alone. Among\r\nHymenoptera the study of the minute Ichueumons, such as the\r\nProctotrupids and Chalcids, especially the egg-parasites; among moths\r\nthe study of the wingless canker-worm moth and Orgyla; among Diptera the\r\nflea, bee louse, sheep tick, bat tick, and other wingless flies; among\r\nColeoptera, the Melo\xc3\xab, and singular Stylops and Xenos; among Neuroptera,\r\nthe snow insect, Boreus, the Podura (Fig. 109) and Lepisma, and\r\nespecially the hemipterous lice, will throw a flood of light on these\r\nprime subjects in philosophical entomology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 109. Podura.]\r\n\r\nWithout farther apology, then, and very dependent on the labors of\r\nothers for our information, we will say a few words on some interesting\r\npoints in the natural history of lice. In the first place, how does the\r\nlouse bite? It is the general opinion among physicians, supported by\r\nable entomologists, that the louse has jaws, and bites. But while the\r\nbird lice (Mallophaga) do have biting jaws, whence the Germans call them\r\nskin-eaters (_pelzfresser_), the mouth parts of the genus Pediculus, or\r\ntrue louse, resemble in their structure those of the bed-bug (Fig. 110),\r\nand other Hemiptera. In its form the louse closely resembles the\r\nbed-bug, and the two groups of lice, the Pediculi and Mallophaga, should\r\nbe considered as families of Hemiptera, though degraded and at the base\r\nof the hemipterous series. The resemblance is carried out in the form of\r\nthe egg, the mode of growth of the embryo, and the metamorphosis of the\r\ninsect after leaving its egg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 110. Bed-bug.]\r\n\r\nSchi\xc3\xb6dte, a Danish entomologist, has, it seems to us, forever settled\r\nthe question as to whether the louse bites the flesh or sucks blood, and\r\ndecides a point interesting to physicians, _i.e._, that the loathsome\r\ndisease called phthiriasis is a nonentity. From this source not only\r\nmany living in poverty and squalor are said to have died, but also men\r\nof renown, among whom Denny in his work on the Anoplura, or lice, of\r\nGreat Britain, mentions the name of "Pheretima, as recorded by\r\nHerodotus, Antiochus Epiphanes, the Dictator Sylla, the two Herods, the\r\nEmperor Maximian, and Phillip the Second." Schi\xc3\xb6dte, in his essay "On\r\nPhthirius, and on the Structure of the Mouth in Pediculus" (Annals and\r\nMagazine of Natural History, 1866, page 213), says that these statements\r\nwill not bear examination, and that this disease should be placed on the\r\n"retired list," for such a malady is impossible to be produced by simply\r\nblood-sucking animals, and that they are only the disgusting attendants\r\non other diseases. Our author thus describes the mouth parts of the\r\nlouse.\r\n\r\n"Lice are no doubt to be regarded as bugs, simplified in structure and\r\nlowered in animal life in accordance with their mode of living as\r\nparasites, being small, flattened, apterous, myopic, crawling and\r\nclimbing, with a conical head, moulded as it were to suit the rugosities\r\nof the surface they inhabit, provided with a soft, transversely furrowed\r\nskin, probably endowed with an acute sense of feeling, which can guide\r\nthem in that twilight in which their mode of life places them. The\r\npeculiar attenuation of the head in front of the antenn\xc3\xa6 at once\r\nsuggests to the practised eye the existence of a mouth adapted for\r\nsuction. This mouth differs from that of the Hemiptera (bed-bug, etc.)\r\ngenerally, in the circumstance that the labium is capable of being\r\nretracted into the upper part of the head, which therefore presents a\r\nlittle fold, which is extended when the labium is protruded. In order to\r\nstrengthen this part, a flat band of chitine is placed on the under\r\nsurface, just as the shoemaker puts a small piece of gutta-percha into\r\nthe back of an India-rubber shoe; as, however, the chitine is not very\r\nelastic, this band is rather thinner in the middle, in order that it may\r\nbend and fold a little when the skin is not extended by the lower lip.\r\nThe latter consists, as usual, of two hard lateral pieces, of which the\r\nfore ends are united by a membrane so that they form a tube, of which\r\nthe interior covering is a continuation of the elastic membrane in the\r\ntop of the head; inside its orifice there are a number of small hooks,\r\nwhich assume different positions according to the degree of protrusion;\r\nif this is at its highest point the orifice is turned inside out, like a\r\ncollar, whereby the small hooks are directed backwards, so that they can\r\nserve as barbs. These are the movements which the animal executes after\r\nhaving first inserted the labium through a sweat-pore. When the hooks\r\nhave got a firm hold, the first pair of set\xc3\xa6 (the real mandibles\r\ntransformed) are protruded; these are, towards their points, united by a\r\nmembrane so as to form a closed tube, from which, again, is inserted the\r\nsecond pair of set\xc3\xa6, or maxill\xc3\xa6, which in the same manner are\r\ntransformed into a tube ending in four small lobes placed crosswise. It\r\nfollows that when the whole instrument is exserted, we perceive a long\r\nmembranous flexible tube hanging down from the labium, and along the\r\nwalls of this tube the setiform mandibles and maxill\xc3\xa6 in the shape of\r\nlong narrow bands of chitine. In this way the tube of suction can be\r\nmade longer or shorter as required, and easily adjusted to the thickness\r\nof the skin in the particular place where the animal is sucking, whereby\r\naccess to the capillary system is secured at any part of the body. It is\r\napparent, from the whole structure of the instrument, that it is by no\r\nmeans calculated on being used as a sting, but is rather to be compared\r\nto a delicate elastic probe, in the use of which the terminal lobes\r\nprobably serve as feelers. As soon as the capillary system is reached,\r\nthe blood will at once ascend into the narrow tube, after which the\r\ncurrent is continued with increasing rapidity by means of the pulsation\r\nof the pumping ventricle and the powerful peristaltic movement of the\r\ndigestive tube."\r\n\r\n[Illustration:[7]111. Mouth of the Louse.]\r\n\r\nIf we compare the form of the louse (Fig. 112, Pediculus capitis, the\r\nhead louse; Fig. 113, P. vestimenti, the body louse) with the young\r\nbed-bug as figured by Westwood (Modern Classification of Insects, ii,.p.\r\n475) we shall see a very close resemblance, the head of the young Cimex\r\nbeing proportionally larger than in the adult, while the thorax is\r\nsmaller, and the abdomen is more ovate, less rounded; moreover the body\r\nis white and partially transparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 113. Body Louse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 112. Head Louse.]\r\n\r\nUnder a high power of the microscope specimens treated with diluted\r\npotash show that the mandibles and maxill\xc3\xa6 arise near each other in the\r\nmiddle of the head opposite the eyes, their bases slightly diverging.\r\nThence they converge to the mouth, over which they meet, and beyond are\r\nfree, being hollow, thin bands of chitine, meeting like the maxill\xc3\xa6, or\r\ntongue, of butterflies to form a hollow tube for suction. The mandibles\r\neach suddenly end in a curved, slender filament, which is probably used\r\nas a tactile organ to explore the best sites in the flesh of their\r\nvictim for drawing blood. On the other hand the maxill\xc3\xa6, which are much\r\nnarrower than the mandibles, become rounded towards the end, bristle\r\nlike, and tipped with numerous exceedingly fine barbs, by which the bug\r\nanchors itself in the flesh, while the blood is pumped through the\r\nmandibles. The base of the large, tubular labium, or beak, which\r\nensheathes the mandibles and maxill\xc3\xa6, is opposite the end of the clypeus\r\nor front edge of the upper side of the head, and at a distance beyond\r\nthe mouth equal to the breadth of the labium itself. The labium, which\r\nis divided into three joints, becomes flattened towards the tip, which\r\nis square, and ends in two thin membranous lobes, probably endowed with\r\na slight sense of touch. On comparing these parts with those of the\r\nlouse, it will be seen how much alike they are with the exception of the\r\nlabium, a very variable organ in the Hemiptera. From the long sucker of\r\nthe Pediculus, to the stout chitinous jaws of the Mallophaga, or bird\r\nlice, is a sudden transition, but on comparing the rest of the head and\r\nbody it will be seen that the distinction only amounts to a family one,\r\nthough Burmeister placed the Mallophaga among the Orthoptera\r\n(grasshoppers and crickets) on account of the mandibles being adapted\r\nfor biting. It has been a common source of error to depend too much upon\r\none or a single set of organs. Insects have been classified on\r\ncharacters drawn from the wings, or the number of the joints of the\r\ntarsi, or the form of the mouth parts. We must take into account in\r\nendeavoring to ascertain the limits of natural groups, as the internal\r\nanatomy and the embryology and metamorphosis of insects, before we can\r\nhope to obtain a natural classification.\r\n\r\nThe family of bird lice is a very extensive one, embracing many genera,\r\nand several hundred species. One or more species infest the skin of all\r\nour domestic and wild mammals and birds, some birds sheltering beneath\r\ntheir feathers four or five species of lice. Before giving a hasty\r\naccount of some of our more common species; we will give a sketch of the\r\nembryological history of the lice, with special reference to the\r\nstructure of the mouth parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 114. Embryo of the Louse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 115. Mouth Parts of the Louse.]\r\n\r\nThe eggs (Fig. 114, egg of the head louse) are long, oval, somewhat\r\npear-shaped, with the hinder end somewhat pointed, while the anterior\r\nend is flattened, and bears little conical micropyles (_m_, minute\r\norifices for the passage of the spermatozoa into the egg), which vary in\r\nform in the different species and genera; the opposite end of the egg is\r\nprovided with a few bristles. The female attaches her eggs to the hairs\r\nor feathers of her host.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 116. Mouth Parts of the Louse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 118. Mouth Parts of Louse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 117. Mouth Parts of Louse.]\r\n\r\nAfter the egg has been fertilized by the male, the blastoderm, or\r\nprimitive skin, forms, and subsequently two layers, or embryonal\r\nmembranes, appear; the outer is called the amnion (Fig. 114, _am_),\r\nwhile the inner visceral membrane (_db_) partially wraps the rude form\r\nof the embryo in its folds. The head (_vk_) of the embryo is now\r\ndirected towards the end of the egg on which the hairs are situated;\r\nafterwards the embryo revolves on its axis and the head lies next to the\r\nopposite end of the egg. Eight tubercles bud out from the under side of\r\nthe head, of which the foremost and longest are the antenn\xc3\xa6 (_as_),\r\nthose succeeding are the mandibles, maxill\xc3\xa6, and second maxill\xc3\xa6, or\r\nlabium. Behind them arise six long, slender tubercles forming the legs,\r\nand the primitive streak rudely marks the lower wall of the thorax and\r\nabdomen not yet formed. Figure 115 represents the head and mouth parts\r\nof the embryo of the same louse; _vk_ is the forehead, or clypeus;\r\n_ant_, the antenn\xc3\xa6; _mad_, the mandibles; _max_1, the\r\nfirst pair of maxill\xc3\xa6, and _max_^2, the second pair\r\nof maxill\xc3\xa6, or labium. Figure 116 represents the mouth parts of the\r\nsame insect a little farther advanced, with the jaws and labium\r\nelongated and closely folded together. Figure 117 represents the same\r\nstill farther advanced; the mandibles (_mad_) are sharp, and resemble\r\nthe jaws of the Mallophaga; and the maxill\xc3\xa6 (_max_^1) and labium\r\n(_max_^2) are still large, while afterwards the labium becomes nearly\r\nobsolete. Figure 118 represents a front view of the mouth parts of a\r\nbird louse, Goniodes; _lb_, is the upper lip, or labrum, lying under the\r\nclypeus; _mad_, the mandibles; max, the maxill\xc3\xa6; _l_, the lyre-formed\r\npiece; and _pl_, the "plate."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 119. Louse of Cow.]\r\n\r\nWe will now describe some of the common species of lice found on a few\r\nof our domestic animals, and the mallophagous parasites occurring on\r\ncertain mammals and birds. The family Pediculina, or true lice, is\r\nhigher than the bird lice, their mouth parts, as well as the structure\r\nof the head, resembling the true Hemiptera, especially the bed bug. The\r\nclypeus, or front of the head, is much smaller than in the bird lice,\r\nthe latter retaining the enlarged forehead of the embryo, it being in\r\nsome species half as large as the rest of the head.\r\n\r\nAll of our domestic mammals and birds are plagued by one or more species\r\nof lice. Figure 119 represents the H\xc3\xa6matopinus vituli, which is brownish\r\nin color. As the specimen figured came from the Burnett collection of\r\nthe Boston Society of Natural History, together with those of the goat\r\nlouse, the louse of the common fowl, and of the cat, they are\r\nundoubtedly naturalized here. Quite a different species is the louse of\r\nthe hog (H. suis, Fig. 120).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 120. Louse of Hog.]\r\n\r\nThe remaining parasites belong to the skin-biting lice, or Mallophaga,\r\nand I will speak of the several genera referred to in their natural\r\norder, beginning with the highest form and that which is nearest allied\r\nto Pediculus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 121. Louse of Domestic Fowl.]\r\n\r\nThe common barn-yard fowl is infested by a louse that we have called\r\nGoniocotes Burnettii (Fig. 121), in honor of the late Dr. W. I. Burnett,\r\na young and talented naturalist and physiologist, who paid more\r\nattention than any one else in this country to the study of these\r\nparasites, and made a large collection of them, now in the museum of the\r\nBoston Society of Natural History. It differs from the G. hologaster of\r\nEurope, which lives on the same bird, in the short second joint of the\r\nantenn\xc3\xa6, which are also stouter; and in the long head, the clypeus being\r\nmuch longer and more acutely rounded; while the head is less hollowed\r\nout at the insertion of the antenn\xc3\xa6. The abdomen is oval, and one-half\r\nas wide as long, with transverse, broad, irregular bands along the edges\r\nof the segments. The mandibles are short and straight, two toothed. The\r\nbody is slightly yellowish, and variously streaked and banded with\r\npitchy black. The duck is infested by a remarkably slender form (Fig.\r\n122, Philopterus squalidus). Figure 123 represents the louse of the cat,\r\nand another species (Fig. 124) of the same genus (Trichodes) lives upon\r\nthe goat.\r\n\r\nThe most degraded genus is Gyropus. Mr. C. Cook has found Gyropus ovalis\r\nof Europe abundant on the Guinea pig. A species is also found on the\r\nporpoise; an interesting fact, as this is the only insect we know of\r\nthat lives parasitically on any marine animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 122. Duck Louse.]\r\n\r\nThe genus Goniodes (Fig. 125, G. stylifer, the turkey louse) is of great\r\ninterest from a morphological and developmental point of view, as the\r\nantenn\xc3\xa6 are described and figured by Denny as being "in the males\r\ncheliform (Fig. 126, _a_, male; _b_, female); the first joint being very\r\nlarge and thick, the third considerably smaller, recurved towards the\r\nfirst, and forming a claw, the fourth and fifth very small, arising\r\nfrom the back of the third." He farther remarks, that "the males of this\r\n[which lives on the turkey] and all the other species of Goniodes, use\r\nthe first and third joints of the antenn\xc3\xa6 with great facility, acting\r\nthe part of a finger and thumb." The antenn\xc3\xa6 of the females are of the\r\nordinary form. This hand-like structure, is, so far as we know, without\r\na parallel among insects, the antenn\xc3\xa6 of the Hemiptera being almost\r\nuniformly filiform, and from two to nine-jointed. The design of this\r\nstructure is probably to enable the male to grasp its consort and also\r\nperhaps to cling to the feathers, and thus give it a superiority over\r\nthe weaker sex in its advances towards courtship. Why is this advantage\r\npossessed by the males of this genus alone? The world of insects, and of\r\nanimals generally abounds in such instances, though existing in other\r\norgans, and the developmentist dimly perceives in such departures from a\r\nnormal type of structure, the origin of new generic forms, whether due\r\nat first to a seemingly accidental variation, or, as in this instance,\r\nperhaps, to long use as prehensile organs through successive generations\r\nof lice having the antenn\xc3\xa6 slightly diverging from the typical\r\ncondition, until the present form has been developed. Another generation\r\nof naturalists will perhaps unanimously agree that the Creator has thus\r\nworked through secondary laws, which many of the naturalists of the\r\npresent day are endeavoring, in a truly scientific and honest spirit of\r\ninquiry, to discover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 124. Louse of the Goat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 123. Louse of the Cat.]\r\n\r\nIn their claw or leg-like form these male antenn\xc3\xa6 also repeat in the\r\nhead, the general form of the legs, whose prehensile and grasping\r\nfunctions they assume. We have seen above that the appendages of the\r\nhead and thorax are alike in the embryo, and the present case is an\r\ninteresting example of the unity of type of the jointed appendages of\r\ninsects, and articulates generally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 120. Antenn\xc3\xa6 of Goniodes.]\r\n\r\nAnother point of interest in these degraded insects is, that the process\r\nof degradation begins either late in the life of the embryo or during\r\nthe changes from the larval to the adult, or winged state. An instance\r\nof the latter may be observed in the wingless female of the canker worm,\r\nso different from the winged male; this difference is created after the\r\nlarval stage, for the caterpillars of both sexes are the same, so far as\r\nwe know. So with numerous other examples among the moths. In the louse,\r\nthe embryo, late in its life, resembles the embryos of other insects,\r\neven Corixa, a member of a not remotely allied family. But just before\r\nhatching the insect assumes its degraded louse physiognomy. The\r\ndevelopmentist would say that this process of degradation points to\r\ncauses acting upon the insect just before or immediately after birth,\r\ninducing the retrogression and retardation of development, and would\r\nconsider it as an argument for the evolution of specific forms by causes\r\nacting on the animal while battling with its fellows in the struggle for\r\nexistence, and perhaps consider that the metamorphoses of the animal\r\nwithin the egg are due to a reflex action of the modes of life of the\r\nancestors of the animal on the embryos of its descendants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 125.

From\r\nthe moment of its birth until its death, usually a twelve-month, it\r\nriots in bloodshed and carnage. Living beneath the waters perhaps eleven\r\nmonths of its life, in the larva and pupa states, it is literally a\r\nwalking pitfall for luckless aquatic insects; but when transformed into\r\na fly, ever on the wing in pursuit of its prey, it throws off all\r\nconcealment, and reveals the more unblushingly its rapacious character.\r\n\r\nNot only do its horrid visage and ferocious bearing frighten children,\r\nwho call it the "Devil\'s Darning-needle," but it even distresses older\r\npersons, so that its name has become a byword. Could we understand the\r\nlanguage of insects, what tales of horror would be revealed! What\r\ntraditions, sagas, fables, and myths must adorn the annals of animal\r\nlife regarding this Dragon among insects!\r\n\r\nTo man, however, aside from its bad name and its repulsive aspect, which\r\nits gay trappings do not conceal, its whole life is beneficent. It is a\r\nscavenger, being like that class ugly and repulsive, and holding\r\nliterally, among insects, the lowest rank in society. In the water, it\r\npreys upon young mosquitoes and the larv\xc3\xa6 of other noxious insects. It\r\nthus aids in maintaining the balance of life, and cleanses the swamps of\r\nmiasmata, thus purifying the air we breathe. During its existence of\r\nthree or four weeks above the waters, its whole life is a continued good\r\nto man. It hawks over pools and fields and through gardens, decimating\r\nswarms of mosquitoes, flies, gnats, and other baneful insects. It is a\r\ntrue Malthus\' delight, and, following that sanguinary philosopher, we\r\nmay believe that our Dragon fly is an entomological Tamerlane or\r\nNapoleon sent into the world by a kind Providence to prevent too close a\r\njostling among the myriads of insect life.\r\n\r\nWe will, then, conquer our repugnance to its ugly looks and savage mien,\r\nand contemplate the hideous monstrosity,--as it is useless to deny that\r\nit combines the graces of the Hunchback of Notre Dame and Dickens\'\r\nQuilp, with certain features of its own,--for the good it does in\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nEven among insects, a class replete with forms the very incarnation of\r\nugliness and the perfection of all that is hideous in nature, our Dragon\r\nfly is most conspicuous. Look at its enormous head, with its beetling\r\nbrows, retreating face, and heavy under jaws,--all eyes and teeth,--and\r\nhung so loosely on its short, weak neck, sunk beneath its enormous\r\nhunchback,--for it is wofully round-shouldered,--while its long, thin\r\nlegs, shrunken as if from disease, are drawn up beneath its breast, and\r\nwhat a hobgoblin it is!\r\n\r\nIts gleaming wings are, however, beautiful objects. They form a broad\r\nexpanse of delicate parchment-like membrane drawn over an intricate\r\nnetwork of veins. Though the body is bulky, it is yet light, and easily\r\nsustained by the wings. The long tail undoubtedly acts as a rudder to\r\nsteady its flight.\r\n\r\nThese insects are almost universally dressed in the gayest colors. The\r\nbody is variously banded with rich shades of blue, green, and yellow,\r\nand the wings give off the most beautiful iridescent and metallic\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nDuring July and August the various species of Libellula and its allies\r\nmost abound. The eggs are attached loosely in bunches to the stems of\r\nrushes and other water-plants. In laying them, the Dragon fly, according\r\nto Mr. P. R. Uhler\'s observations, "alights upon water-plants, and,\r\npushing the end of her body below the surface of the water, glues a\r\nbunch of eggs to the submerged stem or leaf. Libellula auripennis I have\r\noften seen laying eggs, and I think I was not deceived in my observation\r\nthat she dropped a bunch of eggs into the open ditch while balancing\r\nherself just a little way above the surface of the water. I have, also,\r\nseen her settled upon the reeds in brackish water with her abdomen\r\nsubmerged in part, and there attaching a cluster of eggs. I feel pretty\r\nsure that L. auripennis does not always deposit the whole of her eggs at\r\none time, as I have seen her attach a cluster of not more than a dozen\r\nsmall yellow eggs. There must be more than one hundred eggs in one of\r\nthe large bunches. The eggs of some of the Agrions are bright\r\napple-green, but I cannot be sure that I have ever seen them in the very\r\nact of oviposition. They have curious habits of settling upon leaves and\r\ngrass growing in the water, and often allow their abdomens to fall below\r\nthe surface of the water; sometimes they fly against the surface, but I\r\nnever saw what I could assert to be the projecting of the eggs from the\r\nbody upon plants or into the water. The English entomologists assert\r\nthat the female Agrion goes below the surface to a depth of several\r\ninches to deposit eggs upon the submerged stems of plants." The Agrions,\r\nhowever, according to Lucaze Duthiers, a French anatomist, make, with\r\nthe ovipositor, a little notch in the plant upon which they lay their\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 127. Under side of head of Diplax, with the labium or\r\nmask fully extended. _x_, _x_\', _x_\'\'the three subdivisions of the\r\nlabium. _y_, the maxill\xc3\xa6 or second pair of jaws.]\r\n\r\nThese eggs soon hatch, probably during the heat of summer. The larva is\r\nvery active in its habits, being provided with six legs, attached to the\r\nthorax, on the back of which are the little wing-pads, or rudimentary\r\nwings. The large head is provided with enormous eyes, while a pair of\r\nsimple, minute eyelets (ocelli) are placed near the origin of the small\r\nbristle-like feelers, or antenn\xc3\xa6. Seen from beneath, instead of the\r\nformidable array of jaws and accessory organs commonly observed in most\r\ncarnivorous larv\xc3\xa6, we see nothing but a broad, smooth mask covering the\r\nlower part of the face; as if from sheer modesty our young Dragon fly\r\nwas endeavoring to conceal a gape. But wait a moment. Some unwary insect\r\ncomes within striking distance. The battery of jaws is unmasked, and\r\nopens upon the victim. This mask (Fig. 127) is peculiar to the young,\r\nor larva and pupa of the Dragon fly. It is the labium, or under lip\r\ngreatly enlarged, and armed at the broad spoon-shaped extremity (Fig.\r\n127, _x_) with two sharp hooks, adapted for seizing and retaining its\r\nprey. At rest, the terminal half is so bent up as to conceal the face,\r\nand thus the creature crawls about, to all appearance, the most innocent\r\nand lamb-like of insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 128. Abdominal valves; _a_, side view.]\r\n\r\nNot only does the immature Dragon fly walk over the bottom of the pool\r\nor stream it inhabits, but it can also leap for a considerable distance,\r\nand by a most curious contrivance. By a syringe-like apparatus lodged in\r\nthe end of the body, it discharges a stream of water for a distance of\r\ntwo or three inches behind it, thus propelling the insect forwards. This\r\napparatus combines the functions of locomotion and respiration. There\r\nare, as usual, two breathing pores (stigmata) on each side of the\r\nthorax. But the process of breathing seems to be mostly carried on in\r\nthe tail. The trache\xc3\xa6 are here collected in a large mass, sending their\r\nbranches into folds of membrane lining the end of the alimentary canal,\r\nand which act like a piston to force out the water. The entrance to the\r\ncanal is protected by three to five triangular horny valves (Fig. 128,\r\n9, 10, 128 _a_, side view), which open and shut at will. When open, the\r\nwater flows in, bathing the internal gill-like organs, which extract the\r\nair from the water, which is then suddenly expelled by a strong muscular\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 129. Agrion; _b_, False Gill of Larva.]\r\n\r\nIn the smaller forms, such as Agrion (A. saucium, Fig. 129; Fig. 129\r\n_b_, side view of false gill, showing but one leaf), the respiratory\r\nleaves, called the tracheary, or false-gills, are not enclosed within\r\nthe body, but form three broad leaves, permeated by trache\xc3\xa6, or\r\nair-vessels. They are not true gills, however, as the blood is not\r\naerated in them. They only absorb air to supply the trache\xc3\xa6, which\r\naerate the blood only within the general cavity of the body. These false\r\ngills also act as a rudder to aid the insect in swimming.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to watch the Dragon flies through their\r\ntransformations, as they can easily be kept in aquaria. Little, almost\r\nnothing, is known regarding their habits, and any one who can spend the\r\nnecessary time and patience in rearing them, so as to trace up the\r\ndifferent stages from the larva to the adult fly, and describe and\r\nfigure them accurately, will do good service to science.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 130. Pupa of Cordulia.]\r\n\r\nMr. Uhler states that at present we know but little of the young stages\r\nof our species, but the larva and pupa of the Libellulas may be always\r\nknown from the \xc3\x86schnas by the shorter, deeper and more robust form, and\r\ngenerally by their thick clothing of hair. Figure 130 represents the\r\npupa of Cordulia lateralis, and figure 131 that of a Dragon fly referred\r\ndoubtfully to the genus Didymops. For descriptions and figures of other\r\nforms the reader may turn to Mr. Louis Cabot\'s essay "On the Immature\r\nState of the Odonata," published by the Museum of Comparative Zoology at\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 131. Pupa of Didymops?]\r\n\r\nThe pupa scarcely differs from the larva, except in having larger\r\nwing-pads (Fig. 132). It is still active, and as much of a gourmand as\r\never. When the insect is about to assume the pupa state, it moults its\r\nskin. The body having outgrown the larva skin, by a strong muscular\r\neffort a rent opens along the back of the thorax, and the insect having\r\nfastened its claws into some object at the bottom of the pool, the pupa\r\ngradually works its way out of the larva-skin. It is now considerably\r\nlarger than before. Immediately after this tedious operation, its body\r\nis soft, but the crust soon hardens. This change, with most species,\r\nprobably occurs early in summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 132. Pupa of \xc3\x86schna.]\r\n\r\nWhen about to change into the adult fly, the pupa climbs up some plant\r\nnear the surface of the water. Again its back yawns wide open, and from\r\nthe rent our Dragon fly slowly emerges. For an hour or more, it remains\r\ntorpid and listless, with its flabby, soft wings remaining motionless.\r\nThe fluids leave the surface, the crust hardens and dries, rich and\r\nvaried tints appear, and our Dragon fly rises into its new world of\r\nlight and sunshine a gorgeous, but repulsive being. Tennyson thus\r\ndescribes these changes in "The Two Voices":--\r\n\r\n  To-day I saw the Dragon fly\r\n  Come from the wells where he did lie.\r\n  An inner impulse rent the veil\r\n  Of his old husk: from head to tail\r\n  Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.\r\n\r\n  He dried his wings; like gauze they grew;\r\n  Through crofts and pastures wet with dew\r\n  A living flash of light he flew.\r\n\r\nOf our more common, typical forms of Dragon flies, we figure a few,\r\ncommonly observed during the summer. The three-spotted Dragon fly\r\n(Libellula trimaculata), of which figure 133 represents the male, is so\r\ncalled from the three dark clouds on the wings of the female. But the\r\nopposite sex differs in having a dark patch at the front edge of the\r\nwings, and a single broad cloud just beyond the middle of the wing.\r\n\r\nLibellula quadrimaculata, the four-spotted Dragon fly (Fig. 134), is\r\nseen on the wing in June, flying through dry pine woods far from any\r\nstanding water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 133. Libellula trimaculata, male.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 134. Libellula quadrimaculata.]\r\n\r\nThe largest of our Dragon flies are the "Devil\'s Darning-needles,"\r\nEschna heros and grandis, seen hawking about our gardens till dusk. They\r\nfrequently enter houses, carrying dismay and terror among the children.\r\nThe hind-body is long and cylindrical, and gaily colored with bright\r\ngreen and bluish bands and spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 135. Diplax Berenice, male.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 136. Diplax Berenice, female.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 137. Larva of Diplax.]\r\n\r\nOne of our most common Dragon flies is the ruby Dragon fly, Diplax\r\nrubicundula, which is yellowish-red. It is seen everywhere flying over\r\npools, and also frequents dry sunny woods and glades. Another common\r\nform is Diplax Berenice (Fig. 135 male, Fig. 136 female. The\r\naccompanying cut (137) represents the larva, probably of this species,\r\naccording to Mr. Uhler.) It is black, the head blue in front, spotted\r\nwith yellow, while the thorax and abdomen are striped with yellow. There\r\nare fewer stripes on the body of the male, which has only four large\r\nyellow spots on each side of the abdomen. Still another pretty species\r\nis Diplax Elisa (Fig. 138). It is black, with the head yellowish and\r\nwith greenish-yellow spots on the sides of the thorax and base of the\r\nabdomen. There are three dusky spots on the front edge of each wing, and\r\na large cloud at the base of the hind pair towards the hind angles of\r\nthe wing.\r\n\r\nRather a rare form, and of much smaller stature is the Nannophya bella\r\n(Fig. 138, female). It was first detected in Baltimore, and we\r\nafterwards found it not unfrequently by a pond in Maine. Its abdomen is\r\nunusually short, and the reticulations of the wings are large and\r\nsimple. The female is black, while the male is frosted over with a\r\nwhitish powder. Many more species of this family are found in this\r\ncountry, and for descriptions of them we would refer the reader to Dr.\r\nHagen\'s "Synopsis of the Neuroptera of North America," published by the\r\nSmithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 138. Diplax Elisa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 139. Nannophya bella.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 140. May Fly.]\r\n\r\nThe Libellulid\xc3\xa6, or family of Dragon flies, and the Ephemerid\xc3\xa6, or May\r\nflies (Fig. 140), are the most characteristic of the Neuroptera, or\r\nveiny-winged insects. This group is a most interesting one to the\r\nsystematist, as it is composed of so many heterogeneous forms which it\r\nis almost impossible to classify in our rigid and at present necessarily\r\nartificial systems. We divide them into families and sub-families,\r\ngenera and sub-genera, species and varieties, but there is an endless\r\nshifting of characters in these groups. The different groups would seem\r\nwell limited after studying certain forms, when to the systematist\'s\r\nsorrow, here comes a creature, perhaps mimicking an ant, or aphis, or\r\nother sort of bug, or even a butterfly, and for which they would be\r\nreadily mistaken by the uninitiated. Bibliographers have gone mad over\r\nbooks that could not be classified. Imagine the despair of an\r\ninsect-hunter and entomophile, as he sits down to his box of dried\r\nneuroptera. He seeks for a true neuropter in the white ant before him,\r\nbut its very form and habits summon up a swarm of true ants; and then\r\nthe little wingless book louse (Atropos, Fig. 141) scampering\r\nirreverently over the musty pages of his Systema Natur\xc3\xa6, reminds him of\r\nthat closest friend of man--Pediculus vestimenti. Again, his studies\r\nlead him to that gorgeous inhabitant of the South, the butterfly-like\r\nAscalaphus, with its resplendent wings, and slender, knobbed antenn\xc3\xa6 so\r\nmuch like those of butterflies, and visions of these beautiful insects\r\nfill his mind\'s eye; or sundry dun-colored caddis flies, modest,\r\ndelicate neuroptera, with finely fringed wings and slender feelers,\r\ncreate doubts as to whether they are not really allies of the clothes\r\nmoth, so close is the resemblance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 141. Death Tick.]\r\n\r\nThus the student is constantly led astray by the wanton freaks Nature\r\nplays, and becomes sceptical as regards the truth of a natural system,\r\nthough there is one to be discovered; and at last disgusted with the\r\nstiff and arbitrary systems of our books,--a disgust we confess most\r\nwholesome, if it only leads him into a closer communion with nature. The\r\nsooner one leaves those maternal apron-strings,--books,--and learns to\r\nidentify himself with nature, and thus goes out of himself to affiliate\r\nwith the spirit of the scene or object before him,--or, in other words,\r\ncultivates habits of the closest observation and most patient\r\nreflection,--be he painter or poet, philosopher or insect-hunter of low\r\ndegree, he will gain an intellectual strength and power of interpreting\r\nnature, that is the gift of true genius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Ant Lion and adult.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMITES AND TICKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut few naturalists have busied themselves with the study of mites. The\r\nhonored names of Hermann, Von Heyden, Dug\xc3\xa9s, Dujardin and Pagenstecher,\r\nNicolet, Koch and Robin, and the lamented Clapar\xc3\xa8de of Geneva, lead the\r\nsmall number who have published papers in scientific journals. After\r\nthese, and except an occasional note by an amateur microscopist who\r\noccasionally pauses from his "diatomaniacal" studies, and looks upon a\r\nmite simply as a "microscopic object," to be classed in his micrographic\r\nVade Mecum with mounted specimens of sheep\'s wool, and the hairs of\r\nother quadrupeds, a distorted proboscis of a fly, and podura scales, we\r\nread but little of mites and their habits. But few readers of our\r\nnatural history text-books learn from their pages any definite facts\r\nregarding the affinities of these humble creatures, their organization\r\nand the singular metamorphosis a few have been known to pass through. We\r\nshall only attempt in the present article to indicate a few of the\r\ntypical forms of mites, and sketch, with too slight a knowledge to speak\r\nwith much authority, an imperfect picture of their appearance and modes\r\nof living.\r\n\r\nMites are lowly organized Arachnids. This order of insects is divided\r\ninto the Spiders, the Scorpions, the Harvestmen and the Mites (Acarina).\r\nThey have a rounded oval body, without the usual division between the\r\nhead-thorax and abdomen observable in spiders, the head-thorax and\r\nabdomen being merged in a single mass. There are four pairs of legs, and\r\nthe mouth parts consist, as seen in the adjoining figure of a young tick\r\n(Fig. 142, young Ixodes albipictus), of a pair of maxill\xc3\xa6 (_c_), which\r\nin the adult terminates in a two or three-jointed palpus, or feeler; a\r\npair of mandibles (_b_), often covered with several rows of fine teeth,\r\nand ending in three or four larger hooks and a serrated labium (_a_).\r\nThese parts form a beak which the mite or tick insinuates into the flesh\r\nof its host, upon the blood of which it subsists. While many of the\r\nmites are parasitic on animals, some are known to devour the eggs of\r\ninsects and other mites, thrusting their beaks into the egg, and sucking\r\nthe contents. We have seen a mite (Nothrus ovivorus, Fig. 143) busily\r\nengaged in destroying the eggs of a moth like that of the Canker worm,\r\nand Dr. Shimer has observed the Acarus? malus sucking the eggs of the\r\nChinch bug. I have also observed another mite devouring the Aphides on\r\nthe rose leaves in my garden, so that a few mites may be set down as\r\nbeneficial to vegetation. While a few species are injurious to man, the\r\nlarger part are beneficial, being either parasitic and baneful to other\r\nnoxious animals, or more directly useful as scavengers, removing\r\ndecaying animal and vegetable substances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 142, Ixodes albipictus and young.[8]]\r\n\r\nThe transformations of the mites are interesting to the philosophic\r\nzoologist, since the young of certain forms are remarkably different\r\nfrom the adults, and in reaching the perfect state the mite passes\r\nthrough a metamorphosis more striking than that of many insects. The\r\nyoung on leaving the egg have six legs, as we have seen in the case of\r\nthe Ixodes. Sometimes, however, as, for example, in the larva, as we may\r\ncall it, of a European mite, Typhlodromus pyri, the adult of which,\r\naccording to A. Scheuten, is allied to Acarus, and lives under the\r\nepidermis of the leaves of the pear in Europe (while Mr. T. Taylor, of\r\nthe Department of Agriculture at Washington, has found a species in the\r\npear leaves about Washington, and still another form in peach leaves),\r\nthere are but two pairs of legs present, and the body is long,\r\ncylindrical and in a degree worm-like.\r\n\r\nI have had the good fortune to observe the different stages of a bird\r\nmite, intermediate in its form between the Acarus and Sarcoptes, or Itch\r\nmite. On March 6th, Mr. C. Cooke called my attention to certain little\r\nmites which were situated on the narrow groove between the main stem of\r\nthe barb and the outer edge of the barbules of the feathers of the Downy\r\nWoodpecker, and subsequently we found the other forms in the down under\r\nthe feathers. These long worm-like mites were evidently the young of a\r\nsingular Sarcoptes-like mite, as they were found on the same specimen of\r\nWoodpecker at about the same date, and it is known that the growth of\r\nmites is rapid, the metamorphoses, judging by the information which we\r\nnow possess, occupying usually but a few days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 143. Egg-eating Mite.]\r\n\r\nThe young (though there is, probably, a still earlier hexapodous stage)\r\nof this Sarcoptid has an elongated, oblong, flattened body, with four\r\nshort legs, provided with a few bristle-like hairs, and ending in a\r\nstalked sucker, by aid of which the mite is enabled to walk over smooth,\r\nhard surfaces. The body is square at the end, with a slight median\r\nindentation, and four long bristles of equal length. They remained\r\nmotionless in the groove on the barb of the feather, and when removed\r\nseemed very inert and sluggish. A succeeding stage of this mite, which\r\nmay be called the pupal, is considerably smaller than the larva and\r\nlooks somewhat like the adult, the body having become shorter and\r\nbroader. The adult is a most singular form, its body being rudely ovate,\r\nwith the head sunken between the fore legs, which are considerably\r\nsmaller than the second pair, while the third pair are twice as large as\r\nthe second pair, and directed backwards, and the fourth pair are very\r\nsmall, not reaching the extremity of the body, which is deeply cleft and\r\nsupports four long bristles on each side of the cleft, while other\r\nbristles are attached to the legs and body, giving the creature,\r\noriginally ill-shapen, a haggard, unkempt appearance. The two stigmata\r\nor breathing pores open near the cleft in the end of the body, and the\r\nexternal opening of the oviduct is situated between the largest and\r\nthird pair of legs. No males were observed. In a species of Acarus\r\n(Tyroglyphus), somewhat like the Cheese mite, which we have alive at\r\nthe time of writing, in a box containing the remains of a Lucanus larva,\r\nwhich they seem to have consumed, as both young and old are swarming\r\nthere by myriads, the young are oval and like the adults, except that\r\nthey are six-legged, the fourth pair growing out after a succeeding\r\nmoult.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief summary of what has been generally known regarding the\r\nmetamorphoses of a few species of mites. In a few kinds no males have\r\nbeen found; the females have been isolated after being hatched, and yet\r\nhave been known to lay eggs, which produced young without the\r\ninterposition of the males. This parthenogenesis has been noticed in\r\nseveral species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 144. Cheyletus.]\r\n\r\nThese insects often suddenly appear in vast numbers on various articles\r\nof food and about houses, so as to be very annoying. Mr. J. J. H.\r\nGregory, of Marblehead, Mass., has found a mite allied to the European\r\nspecies here figured (Fig. 144) very injurious to the seeds of the\r\ncabbage, which it sucked dry. This is an interesting form, and we have\r\ncalled it Cheyletus seminivorus It is of medium size, and especially\r\nnoticeable from the tripartite palpi, which are divided into an outer,\r\nlong, curved, claw-like lobe, with two rounded teeth at the base, and\r\ntwo inner, slender lobes pectinated on the inner side, the third\r\ninnermost lobe being minute. The beak terminates in a sharp blade-like\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nWe have received a Cheyletus-like mite, said to have been "extracted\r\nfrom the human face" in New Orleans. The body is oblong, square behind;\r\nthe head is long and pointed, while the maxill\xc3\xa6 end in a long, curved,\r\ntoothed, sickle-like blade. That this creature has the habits of the\r\nitch mite is suggested by the curious, large, hair-like spines with\r\nwhich the body and legs are sparsely armed, some being nearly half as\r\nlong as the body. These hairs are covered with very fine spinules. Those\r\non the end of the body are regularly spoon-shaped. These strange hairs,\r\nwhich are thickest on the legs, probably assisted the mite in anchoring\r\nitself in the skin of its host. We have read no account of this strange\r\nand interesting form. It is allied to the Acaropsis Mericourti which\r\nlives in the human face.\r\n\r\nA species, "apparently of the genus Gamasus," according to Dr. Leidy,\r\nhas been found living in the ear (at the bottom of the external auditory\r\nmeatus, and attached to the membrana tympani) of steers. "Whether this\r\nmite is a true parasite of the ear of the living ox, or whether it\r\nobtained access to the position in which it was found after the death of\r\nthe ox in the slaughter house, has not yet been determined."\r\n\r\nWe will now give a hasty glance at the different groups of mites,\r\npausing to note those most interesting from their habits or relation to\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe most highly organized mite (and by its structure most closely allied\r\nto the spider) is the little red garden mite, belonging to the genus\r\nTrombidium, to which the genus Tetranychus is also nearly related. Our\r\nown species of the former genus have not been "worked up," or in other\r\nwords identified and described, so that whether the European T.\r\nholosericeum Linn. is our species or not, we cannot tell. The larv\xc3\xa6 of\r\nthis and similar species are known to live parasitically upon Harvestmen\r\n(Phalangium), often called Daddy-long-legs; and upon Aphides,\r\ngrasshoppers and other insects. Mr. Riley has made known to us through\r\nthe "American Naturalist" (and from his account our information is\r\ntaken), the habits of certain young of the garden mite (Trombidium)\r\nwhich are excessively annoying in the Southwestern States. The first is\r\nthe Leptus? Americanus (Fig. 145), or American Harvest mite. It is only\r\nknown as yet in the larval or Leptus state, when it is of the form\r\nindicated in the cut, and brick red in color. "This species is barely\r\nvisible with the naked eye, moves readily and is found more frequently\r\nupon children than upon adults. It lives mostly on the scalp and under\r\nthe arm pits, but is frequently found on the other parts of the body. It\r\ndoes not bury itself in the flesh, but simply insinuates the anterior\r\npart of the body just under the skin, thereby causing intense\r\nirritation, followed by a little red pimple. As with our common ticks,\r\nthe irritation lasts only while the animal is securing itself, and its\r\npresence would afterwards scarcely be noticed but for the pimple which\r\nresults."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 145 _a._ American Harvest Mite; _b._ Irritating Harvest\r\nMite; the dots underneath indicating the natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe second species (Fig. 145 _b_, Leptus? irritans) is also only known\r\nin the Leptus stage. It is evidently the larva of a distinct genus from\r\nthe other form, having enormous maxill\xc3\xa6 and a broad body; it is also\r\nbrick red. Mr. Riley says that "this is the most troublesome and,\r\nperhaps, best known of the two, causing intense irritation and swelling\r\non all parts of the body, but more especially on the legs and around the\r\nankles. Woe betide the person who, after bathing in the Mississippi\r\nanywhere in this latitude, is lured to some green dressing-spot of weeds\r\nor grass! He may, for the time, consider himself fortunate in getting\r\nrid of mud and dirt, but he will afterwards find to his sorrow that he\r\nexchanged them for something far more tenacious in these microscopic\r\nHarvest-mites. If he has obtained a good supply of them, he will in a\r\nfew hours begin to suffer from severe itching, and for the next two or\r\nthree days will be likely to scratch until his limbs are sore.\r\n\r\n"With the strong mandibles and the elbowed maxill\xc3\xa6 which act like arms,\r\nthis mite is able to bury itself completely in the flesh, thereby\r\ncausing a red swelling with a pale pustulous centre containing watery\r\nmatter. If, in scratching, he is fortunate enough to remove the mite\r\nbefore it enters, the part soon heals. But otherwise the irritation\r\nlasts for two, three or four days, the pustulous centre reappearing as\r\noften as it is broken.\r\n\r\n"The animal itself, on account of its minute size, is seldom seen, and\r\nthe uninitiated, when first troubled with it, are often alarmed at the\r\nsymptoms and at a loss to account for them. Fortunately these little\r\nplagues never attach themselves to persons in such immense numbers as do\r\nsometimes young or so-called \'seed\' ticks; but I have known cases where,\r\nfrom the irritation and consequent scratching, the flesh had the\r\nappearance of being covered with ulcers; and in some localities, where\r\nthese pests most abound, sulphur is often sprinkled during \'jigger\'\r\nseason in the boots or shoes as a protection.\r\n\r\n"Sulphur ointment is the best remedy against the effects of either of\r\nthese mites, though when that cannot be obtained, saleratus water and\r\nsalt water will partially allay the irritation.\r\n\r\n"The normal food of either must, apparently, consist of the juices of\r\nplants, and the love of blood proves ruinous to those individuals who\r\nget a chance to indulge it. For unlike the true Jigger, the female of\r\nwhich deposits eggs in the wound she makes, these Harvest-mites have no\r\nobject of the kind, and when not killed by the hands of those they\r\ntorment, they soon die victims to their sanguinary appetite."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 146. Astoma of the Fly.]\r\n\r\nAnother Leptus-like form is the parasite of the fly, described by Mr.\r\nRiley under the name of Astoma? muscarum (Fig. 146). How nearly allied\r\nit is to the European Astoma parasiticum we have not the means of\r\njudging.\r\n\r\nThe European Tetranychus telarius Linn., or web-making mite, spins large\r\nwebs on the leaves of the linden tree. Then succeed in the natural order\r\nthe water mites (Hydrachna), which may be seen running over submerged\r\nsticks and on plants, mostly in fresh water, and rarely on the borders\r\nof the sea. The young after leaving the egg differ remarkably from the\r\nadults, so as to have been referred to a distinct genus (Achlysia) by\r\nthe great French naturalist, Audouin. They live as parasites on various\r\nwater insects, such as Dytiscus, Nepa and Hydrometra, and when mature\r\nlive free in the water, though Von Baer observed an adult Hydrachna\r\nconcharum living parasitically on the gills of the fresh-water mussel,\r\nAnodon. The species are of minute size. Collectors of beetles often meet\r\nwith a species of Uropoda attached firmly to their specimens of\r\ndung-inhabiting or carrion beetles. It is a smoothly polished, round,\r\nflattened mite, with short, thick legs, scarcely reaching beyond the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 147. Cattle Tick.]\r\n\r\nWe now come to the Ticks, which comprise the largest mites. The genus\r\nArgas closely resembles Ixodes. Gerstaecker states that the Argas\r\nPersicus is very annoying to travellers in Persia. The habits of the\r\nwood ticks (Ixodes) are well known. Travellers in the tropics speak of\r\nthe intolerable torment occasioned by these pests which, occurring\r\nordinarily on shrubs and trees, attach themselves to all sorts of\r\nreptiles, beasts and cattle, and even man himself as he passes by within\r\ntheir reach. Sometimes cases fall within the practice of the physician,\r\nwho is called to remove the tick, which is found sometimes literally\r\nburied beneath the skin. Mr. J. Stauffer writes me, that "on June 23d\r\nthe daughter of Abraham Jackson (colored), playing among the leaves in a\r\nwood, near Springville, Lancaster County, Penn., on her return home\r\ncomplained of pain in the arm. No attention was paid to it till the next\r\nday, when a raised tumor was noticed, a small portion protruding through\r\nthe skin, apparently like a splinter of wood. The child was taken to Dr.\r\nMorency, who applied the forceps, and after considerable pain to the\r\nchild, and labor to himself, extracted a species of Ixodes, nearly\r\none-quarter of an inch long, and of an oval form and brown mahogany\r\ncolor, with a metallic spot, like silver bronze, centrally on the dorsal\r\nregion." This tick proved, from Mr. Stauffer\'s figures, to be, without\r\ndoubt, Ixodes unipunctata. It has also been found in Massachusetts by\r\nMr. F. G. Sanborn.\r\n\r\nAnother species is the Ixodes bovis (Fig. 147), the common cattle tick\r\nof the Western States and Central America. It is very annoying to horned\r\ncattle, gorging itself with their blood, but is by no means confined to\r\nthem alone, as it lives indifferently upon the rattlesnake, the iguana,\r\nsmall mammals and undoubtedly any other animal that brushes by its\r\nlurking-place in the forest. It is a reddish, coriaceous, flattened,\r\nseed-like creature, with the body oblong oval, and contracted just\r\nbehind the middle. When fully grown it measures from a quarter to half\r\nan inch in length. We have received it from Missouri, at the hands of\r\nMr. Riley, and Mr. J. A. McNiel has found it very abundantly on horned\r\ncattle on the western coast of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the genus Acarus (Tyroglyphus), of which the cheese and\r\nsugar mites are examples. Some species of Acarian mites have been found\r\nin the lungs and blood-vessels, and even the intestinal canal of certain\r\nvertebrates, while the too familiar itch insect lurks under the skin of\r\nthe hand and other parts of the body of certain uncleanly human bipeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 148. Sugar Mite.]\r\n\r\nMany people have been startled by statements in newspapers and more\r\nauthoritative sources, as to the immense numbers of mites (Acarus\r\nsacchari, Fig. 148) found in unrefined or raw sugar. According to Prof.\r\nCameron, of Dublin, as quoted in the "Journal of the Franklin\r\nInstitute," for November, 1868, "Dr. Hassel (who was the first to notice\r\ntheir general occurrence in the raw sugar sold at London) found them in\r\na living state in no fewer than sixty-nine out of seventy-two samples.\r\nHe did not detect them in a single specimen of refined sugar. In an\r\ninferior sample of raw sugar, examined in Dublin by Mr. Cameron, he\r\nreports finding five hundred mites in ten grains of sugar, so that in a\r\npound\'s weight occurred one hundred thousand of these little creatures,\r\nwhich seem to have devoted themselves with a martyr-like zeal to the\r\nadulteration of sugar. They appear as white specks in the sugar. The\r\ndisease known as grocer\'s itch is, undoubtedly, due to the presence of\r\nthis mite, which, like its ally the Sarcoptes, works its way under the\r\nskin of the hand, in this case, however, of cleanly persons. Mr. Cameron\r\nstates that "the kind of sugar which is both healthful and economical,\r\nis the dry, large-grained and light-colored variety."\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the preceding, is the Cheese mite (Acarus siro Linn.),\r\nwhich often abounds in newly made cheese. Lyonet states that during\r\nsummer this mite is viviparous. Acarus farin\xc3\xa6 DeGeer, as its name\r\nindicates, is found in flour. Other species have been known to occur in\r\nulcers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 149. Mange Mite.]\r\n\r\nWe should also mention the Mange insect of the horse (Psoroptes equi,\r\nFig. 149, much enlarged; _a_, head more magnified). According to Prof.\r\nVerrill it is readily visible to the naked eye and swarms on horses\r\nafflicted with the mange, which is a disease analogous to the itch in\r\nman. It has a soft, depressed body, spiny beneath at the base of the\r\nlegs and on the thorax. One or both of the two posterior pairs of feet\r\nbear suckers, and all are more or less covered with long, slender hairs.\r\nThis insect may be destroyed by the same remedies as are used for lice\r\nand for the human itch. The best remedy is probably a solution of\r\nsulphuret of potassium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 150. Itch Mite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 151. Nose Mite.]\r\n\r\nThe itch insect (Sarcoptes scabiei, Fig. 150) was first recognized by an\r\nArabian author of the twelfth century, as the cause of the disease which\r\nresults from its attacks. The body of the insect is rounded, with the\r\ntwo hind pair of feet rudimentary and bearing long hairs. It buries\r\nitself in the skin on the more protected parts of the body, and by its\r\npunctures maintains a constant irritation. Other species are known to\r\ninfest the sheep and dog. Another singular mite is the Demodex\r\nfolliculorum (Fig. 151), which was discovered by Dr. Simon, of Berlin,\r\nburied in the diseased follicles of the wings of the nose in man. It is\r\na long, slender, worm-like form, with eight short legs, and in the\r\nlarva state has six legs. This singular form is one of the lowest and\r\nmost degraded of the order of Arachnids. A most singular mite was\r\ndiscovered by Newport on the body of a larva of a wild bee, and\r\ndescribed by him under the name of Heteropus ventricosus. The body of\r\nthe fully formed female is long and slender. After attaining this form,\r\nits small abdomen begins to enlarge until it assumes a globular form,\r\nand the mass of mites look like little beads. Mr. Newport was unable to\r\ndiscover the male, and thought that this mite was parthenogenous. It\r\nwill be seen that the adult Demodex retains the elongated, worm-like\r\nappearance of the larva of the higher mites, such as Typhlodromus. This\r\nis an indication of its low rank, and hints of a relationship to the\r\nTardigrades and the Pentastoma, the latter being a degraded mite, and\r\nthe lowest of its order, living parasitically within the bodies of other\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Harvestman.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The figure at the bottom on the left represents the adult,\r\nfully-gorged tick.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nBRISTLE-TAILS AND SPRING-TAILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thysanura, as the Poduras and their allies, the Lepismas, are\r\ncalled, have been generally neglected by entomologists, and but few\r\nnaturalists have paid special attention to them.[9] Of all those\r\nmicroscopists who have examined Podura scales as test objects, we wonder\r\nhow many really know what a Podura is?\r\n\r\nIn preparing the following account I have been under constant\r\nindebtedness to the admirable and exhaustive papers of Sir John Lubbock,\r\nin the London "Linn\xc3\xa6an Transactions" (vols. 23, 26 and 27).\r\nEntomologists will be glad to learn that he is shortly going to press\r\nwith a volume on the Poduras, which, in distinction from the Lepismas,\r\nto which he restricts the term Thysanura, he calls Collembola, in\r\nallusion to the sucker-like tubercle situated on the under side of the\r\nbody, which no other insects are known to possess.\r\n\r\nThe group of Bristle-tails, as we would dub the Lepismas in distinction\r\nfrom the Spring-tails, we will first consider. They are abundant in the\r\nMiddle States under stones and leaves in forests, and northward are\r\ncommon in damp houses, while one beautiful species that we have never\r\nnoticed elsewhere, is our "cricket on the hearth," abounding in the\r\nchinks and crannies of the range of our house, and also in closets,\r\nwhere it feeds on sugar, etc., and comes out like cockroaches, at night,\r\nshunning the light. Like the cockroaches, which it vaguely resembles in\r\nform, this species loves hot and dry localities, in distinction from the\r\nothers which seek moisture as well as darkness. By some they are called\r\n"silver witches," and as they dart off, when disturbed, like a streak of\r\nlight, their bodies being coated in a suit of shining mail, which the\r\narrangement of the scales resembles, they have really a weird and\r\nghostly look.\r\n\r\nThe most complicated genus, and the one which stands at the head of the\r\nfamily, is Machilis, one species of which lives in the Northern and\r\nMiddle States, and another in Oregon. They affect damp places, living\r\nunder leaves and stones. They all have rounded, highly arched bodies,\r\nand large compound eyes, the two being united together. The maxillary\r\npalpi are greatly developed, but the chief characteristics are the\r\ntwo-jointed stylets arranged in nine pairs along each side of the\r\nabdomen, reminding us of the abdominal legs of Myriopods. The body ends\r\nin three long bristles, as in Lepisma.\r\n\r\nThe Lepisma saccharina of Linn\xc3\xa6us, if, as is probable, that is the name\r\nof our common species, is not uncommon in old damp houses, where it has\r\nthe habits of the cockroach, eating cloths, tapestry, silken trimmings\r\nof furniture, and doing occasional damage to libraries by devouring the\r\npaste, and eating holes in the leaves and covers of books.\r\n\r\nIn general form Lepisma may be compared to the larva of Perla, a\r\nnet-veined Neuropterous insect, and also to the narrow-bodied species of\r\ncockroaches, minus the wings. The body is long and narrow, covered with\r\nrather coarse scales, and ends in three many jointed anal stylets, or\r\nbristles, which closely resemble the many jointed antenn\xc3\xa6, which are\r\nremarkably long and slender. The thermophilous species already alluded\r\nto may be described as perhaps the type of the genus, the L. saccharina\r\nbeing simpler in its structure. The body is narrow and flattened; the\r\nbasal joints of the legs being broad, flat and almost triangular, like\r\nthe same joints in the cockroaches. The legs consist of six joints, the\r\ntarsal joints being large and two in number, and bearing a pair of\r\nterminal curved claws. The three thoracic segments are of nearly equal\r\nsize, and the eight abdominal segments are also of similar size. The\r\ntrache\xc3\xa6 are well developed, and may be readily seen in the legs. The end\r\nof the rather long and weak abdomen is propped up by two or three pairs\r\nof bristles, which are simple, not jointed, but moving freely at their\r\ninsertion; thus they take the place of legs, and remind one of the\r\nabdominal legs of the Myriopods; and we shall see in certain other\r\ngenera (Machilis and Campodea) of the Bristle-tails that there are\r\nactually two-jointed bristles arranged in pairs along the abdomen. They\r\nmay probably be directly compared with the abdominal legs of Myriopods.\r\nFurther study, however, of the homologies of these peculiar appendages,\r\nand especially a knowledge of the embryological development of Lepisma\r\nand Machilis, is needed before this interesting point can be definitely\r\nsettled. The three many jointed anal stylets may, however, be directly\r\ncompared with the similar appendages of Perla and Ephemera. The mode of\r\ninsertion of the antenn\xc3\xa6 of this family is much like that of the\r\nMyriopods, the front of the head being flattened, and concealing the\r\nbase of the antenn\xc3\xa6, as in the Centipedes and Pauropus. Indeed, the head\r\nof any Thysanurous insect seen from above, bears a general resemblance\r\nin some of its features to that of the Centipede and its allies. So in a\r\nless degree does the head of the larv\xc3\xa6 of certain Neuroptera and\r\nColeoptera. The eyes are compound, the single facets forming a sort of\r\nheap. The clypeus and labrum, or upper lip, is, in all the Thysanura,\r\ncarried far down on the under side of the head, the clypeus being almost\r\nobsolete in the Podurid\xc3\xa6, this being one of the most essential\r\ncharacters of that family. Indeed, it is somewhat singular that these\r\nand other important characteristics of this group have been almost\r\nentirely passed over by authors, who have consequently separated these\r\ninsects from other groups on what appear to the writer as comparatively\r\nslight and inconsiderable characters. The mouth-parts of the Lepismatid\xc3\xa6\r\n(especially the thermophilous Lepisma, which we now describe) are most\r\nreadily compared with those of the larva of Perla. The rather large,\r\nstout mandibles are concealed at their tips, under the upper lip, which\r\nmoves freely up and down when the creature opens its mouth. The mandible\r\nis about one-third as broad as long, armed with three sharp teeth on the\r\nouter edge, and with a broad cutting edge within, and still further\r\ninwards a lot of straggling spinules. In all these particulars, the\r\nmandible of Lepisma is comparable with that of certain Coleoptera and\r\nNeuroptera. So also are the maxill\xc3\xa6 and labium, though we are not aware\r\nthat any one has indicated how close the homology is. The accompanying\r\nfigure (152) of the maxilla of a beetle may serve as an example of the\r\nmaxilla of the Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Neuroptera. In these insects\r\nit consists almost invariably of three lobes, the outer being the\r\npalpus, the middle lobe the galea, and the innermost the lacinia; the\r\nlatter undergoing the greatest modifications, forming a comb composed of\r\nspines and hairs varying greatly in relative size and length. How much\r\nthe palpi vary in these groups of insects is well known. The galea\r\nsometimes forms a palpus-like appendage. Now these three lobes may be\r\neasily distinguished in the maxilla of Lepisma. The palpus instead of\r\nbeing directed forward, as in the insects mentioned above (in the pupa\r\nof Ephemera the maxilla is much like that of Lepisma), is inserted\r\nnearer the base than usual and thrown off at right angles to the\r\nmaxilla, so that it is stretched out like a leg, and in moving about the\r\ninsect uses its maxill\xc3\xa6 partly as supports for its head. They are very\r\nlong and large, and five or six-jointed. The galea, or middle division,\r\nforms a simple lobe, while the lacinia has two large chitinous teeth on\r\nthe inner edge, and internally four or five hairs arising from a thin\r\nedge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 152. Maxilla.]\r\n\r\nThe labium is much as in that of Perla, being broad and short, with a\r\ndistinct median suture, indicating its former separation in embryonic\r\nlife into a pair of appendages. The labial palpi are three-jointed, the\r\njoints being broad, and in life directed backwards instead of forwards\r\nas in the higher insects.\r\n\r\nThere are five American species of the genus Lepisma in the Museum of\r\nthe Peabody Academy. Besides the common L. saccharina? there are four\r\nundescribed species; one found about out-houses and cellars, and the\r\nheat-loving form, perhaps an imported, species, found in a kitchen in\r\nSalem, and apparently allied to the L. thermophila Lucas, of houses in\r\nBrest, France; and lastly two allied forms, one from Key West, and\r\nanother from Polvon, Western Nicaragua, collected by Mr. McNiel. The\r\nlast three species are beautifully ornamented with finely spinulated\r\nhairs arranged in tufts on the head; while the sides of the body, and\r\nedges of the basal joints of the legs are fringed with them.\r\n\r\nThe interesting genus Nicoletia stands at the bottom of the group. It\r\nhas the long, linear, scaleless body of Campodea, in the family below,\r\nbut the head and its appendages are like Lepisma, the maxillary palpi\r\nbeing five-jointed, and the labial palpi four-jointed. The eyes are\r\nsimple, arranged in a row of seven on each side of the head. The abdomen\r\nends in three long and many jointed stylets, and there are the usual\r\n"false branchial feet" along each side of the abdomen. There are two\r\nEuropean species which occur in greenhouses. No species have yet been\r\nfound in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 153. Japyx solifugus.]\r\n\r\nThe next family of Thysanura is the Campode\xc3\xa6, comprising the two genera\r\nCampodea and Japyx. These insects are much smaller than the Lepismid\xc3\xa6,\r\nand in some respects are intermediate between that family and the\r\nPodurid\xc3\xa6 (including the Smynthurid\xc3\xa6).\r\n\r\nIn this family the body is long and slender, and the segments much alike\r\nin size. There is a pair of spiracles on each thoracic ring. The\r\nmandibles are long and slender, ending in three or four teeth, and with\r\nthe other appendages of the mouth are concealed within the head, "only\r\nthe tips of the palpi (and of the maxill\xc3\xa6 when these are opened)\r\nprojecting a very little beyond the rounded entire margin of the\r\nepistoma," according to Haliday. The maxill\xc3\xa6 are comb-shaped, due to the\r\nfour slender, minutely ciliated spines placed within the outer tooth.\r\nThe labium in Japyx is four-lobed and bears a small two-jointed palpus.\r\nThe legs are five-jointed, the tarsi consisting of a single joint,\r\nending in two large claws. The abdomen consists of ten segments, and in\r\nCampodea along each side is a series of minute, two-jointed appendages\r\nsuch as have been described in Machilis. These are wanting in Japyx.\r\nNone of the species in this family have the body covered with scales.\r\nThey are white, with a yellowish tinge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more complicated genus of the two is Japyx (Fig. 153, Japyx\r\nsolifugus, found under stones in Southern Europe; _a_, the mouth from\r\nbeneath, with the maxill\xc3\xa6 open; _b_, maxilla; _d_, mandible; _c_,\r\noutline of front of head seen from beneath, with the labial palpi in\r\nposition) which, as remarked by the late Mr. Haliday (who has published\r\nan elaborate essay on this genus in the Linn\xc3\xa6an Transactions, vol. 24,\r\n1864), resembles Forficula in the large forceps attached to its tail. An\r\nAmerican species (J. Saussurii) lives in Mexico, and we look for its\r\ndiscovery in Texas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 154. Campodea staphylinus.]\r\n\r\nCampodea (C. staphylinus Westw., Fig. 154, enlarged; _a_, mandible; _b_,\r\nmaxilla), otherwise closely related, has more rudimentary mouth-parts,\r\nand the abdomen ends in two many jointed appendages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155. Larva of Perla.]\r\n\r\nOur common American species of Campodea (C. Americana) lives under\r\nstones in damp places. It is yellowish, about a sixth of an inch in\r\nlength, is very agile in its movements, and would easily be mistaken for\r\na very young Lithobius. A larger species and differing in having longer\r\nantenn\xc3\xa6, has been found by Mr. C. Cooke in Mammoth Cave, and has been\r\ndescribed in the "American Naturalist" under the name of Campodea\r\nCookei. Haliday has remarked that this family bears much resemblance to\r\nthe Neuropterous larva of Perla (Fig. 155), as previously remarked by\r\nGervais; and the many points of resemblance of this family and the\r\nLepismid\xc3\xa6 to the larval forms of some Neuroptera that are active in the\r\npupa state (the Pseudoneuroptera of Erichson and other authors) are very\r\nstriking. Campodea resembles the earliest larval form of Chlo\xc3\xabon, as\r\nfigured by Sir John Lubbock, even to the single jointed tarsus; and why\r\nthese two Thysanurous families should be removed from the Neuroptera we\r\nare unable, at present, to understand, as to our mind they scarcely\r\ndiverge from the Neuropterous type more than the Mallophaga, or biting\r\nlice, from the type of Hemiptera.\r\n\r\nHaliday, remarking on the opinion of Linn\xc3\xa6us and Schrank, who referred\r\nCampodea to the old genus Podura, says with much truth, "it may be\r\nperhaps no unfair inference to draw, that the insect in question is in\r\nsome measure intermediate between both," _i. e._, Podura and Lepisma.\r\nThis is seen especially in the mouth-parts which are withdrawn into the\r\nhead, and become very rudimentary, affording a gradual passage into the\r\nmouth-parts of the Podurid\xc3\xa6, which we now describe.\r\n\r\nThe next group, the Podurelles of Nicolet, and Collembola of Lubbock,\r\nare considered by the latter, who has studied them with far more care\r\nthan any one else, as "less closely allied" to the Lepismid\xc3\xa6 "than has\r\nhitherto been supposed." He says "the presence of trache\xc3\xa6, the structure\r\nof the mouth and the abdominal appendage; all indicate a wide\r\ndistinction between the Lepismid\xc3\xa6 and the Podurid\xc3\xa6. We must, indeed, in\r\nmy opinion, separate them entirely from one another; and I would\r\nventure to propose for the group comprised in the old genus Podura, the\r\nterm Collembola, as indicating the existence of a projection, or\r\nmammilla, enabling the creature to attach or glue itself to the body on\r\nwhich it stands." Then without expressing his views as to the position\r\nand affinities of the Lepismid\xc3\xa6, he remarks "as the upshot of all this,\r\nthen, while the Collembola are clearly more nearly allied to the Insecta\r\nthan to the Crustacea or Arachnida, we cannot, I think, regard them as\r\nOrthoptera or Neuroptera, or even as true insects. That is to say, the\r\nColeoptera, Orthoptera, Neuroptera, Lepidoptera, etc., are in my\r\nopinion, more nearly allied to one another than they are to the Podurid\xc3\xa6\r\nor Smynthurid\xc3\xa6. On the other hand, we certainly cannot regard the\r\nCollembola as a group equivalent in value to the Insecta. If, then, we\r\nattempt to map out the Articulata, we must, I think, regard the\r\nCrustacea and Insecta as continents, the Myriopoda and Collembola as\r\nislands--of less importance, but still detached. Or, if we represent the\r\ndivisions of the Articulata like the branching of a tree, we must\r\npicture the Collembola as a separate branch, though a small one, and\r\nmuch more closely connected with the Insecta than with the Crustacea or\r\nthe Arachnida." Lamarck regarded them as more nearly allied to the\r\nCrustacea than Insecta. Gervais, also, in the "Histoire Naturelle des\r\nInsectes: Apt\xc3\xa8res," indicates a considerable diversity existing between\r\nthe Lepismid\xc3\xa6 and Podurid\xc3\xa6, though they are placed next to each other.\r\nSomewhat similar views have been expressed by so high an authority as\r\nProfessor Dana, who, in the "American Journal of Science" (vol. 37,\r\nJan., 1864), proposed a classification of insects based on the principle\r\nof cephalization, and divided the Hexapodous insects into three groups:\r\nthe first (Ptero-prosthenics, or Ctenopters) comprising the Hymenoptera,\r\nDiptera, Aphaniptera (fleas), Lepidoptera, Homoptera, Trichoptera and\r\nNeuroptera; the second group (Ptero-metasthenics, or Elytropters)\r\ncomprising the Coleoptera, Hemiptera and Orthoptera; while the Thysanura\r\ncompose the third group. Lubbock has given us a convenient historical\r\nview of the opinions of different authors regarding the classification\r\nof these insects, which we find useful. Nicolet, the naturalist who,\r\nprevious to Lubbock, has given us the most correct and complete account\r\nof the Thysanura, regarded them as an order, equivalent to the\r\nColeoptera or Diptera, for example. In this he followed Latreille, who\r\nestablished the order in 1796. The Abb\xc3\xa9 Bourlet adopted the same view.\r\nOn the other hand Burmeister placed the Thysanura as a separate tribe\r\nbetween the Mallophaga (Bird Lice) and Orthoptera, and Gerstaecker\r\nplaced them among the Orthoptera. Fabricius and Blainville put them with\r\nthe Neuroptera, and the writer, in his "Guide to the Study of Insects,"\r\nand previously in 1863, ignorant of the views of the two last named\r\nauthors, considered the Thysanura as degraded Neuroptera, and noticed\r\ntheir resemblance to the larv\xc3\xa6 of Perla, Ephemera, and other Neuroptera,\r\nsuch as Rhaphidia and Panorpa, regarding them as standing "in the same\r\nrelation to the rest of the Neuroptera [in the Linn\xc3\xa6an sense], as the\r\nflea does to the rest of the Diptera, or the lice and Thrips to the\r\nhigher Hemiptera."\r\n\r\nAfter having studied the Thysanura enough to recognize the great\r\ndifficulty of deciding as to their affinities and rank, the writer does\r\nnot feel prepared to go so far as Dana and Lubbock, for reasons that\r\nwill be suggested in the following brief account of the more general\r\npoints in their structure, reserving for another occasion a final\r\nexpression of his views as to their classification.\r\n\r\nThe Podurid\xc3\xa6, so well known by name, as affording the scales used by\r\nmicroscopists as test objects, are common under stones and wet chips, or\r\nin damp places, cellars, mushrooms and about manure heaps. They need\r\nmoisture, and consequently shade. They abound most in spring and autumn,\r\nlaying their eggs at both seasons, though most commonly in the spring.\r\nDuring a mild December, they may be found in abundance under sticks and\r\nstones, even in situations so far north as Salem, Mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 156. Smynthurus.]\r\n\r\nThe body of the Poduras is rather short and thick, most so in Smynthurus\r\n(Fig. 156), and becoming long and slender in Tomocerus and Isotoma. The\r\nsegments are inclined to be of unequal size, the prothoracic ring\r\nsometimes becoming almost obsolete, and some of the abdominal rings are\r\nmuch smaller than others; while in Lipura and Anura, the lowest forms of\r\nthe group, the segments are all much alike in size.\r\n\r\nThe head is in form much like that of certain larv\xc3\xa6 of Neuroptera and of\r\nForficula, an Orthopterous insect. The basal half of the head is marked\r\noff from the eye-bearing piece (epicranium) by a V-shaped suture[10]\r\n(Fig. 157, head of Degeeria; compare also the head of the larva of\r\nForficula, Fig. 158, in which the suture is the same), and the insertion\r\nof the antenn\xc3\xa6 is removed far down the front, near the mouth, the\r\nclypeus being very short; this piece, so large and prominent in the\r\nhigher insects, is not distinctly separated by suture from the\r\nsurrounding parts of the head, thus affording one of the best\r\ndistinctive characters of the Podurid\xc3\xa6. The eyes are situated on top of\r\nthe head just behind the antenn\xc3\xa6, and are simple, consisting of a group\r\nof from five to eight or ten united into a mass in Smynthurus, but\r\nseparated in the Podurid\xc3\xa6 (see Fig. 176, _e_, eye of Anurida). The\r\nantenn\xc3\xa6 are usually four-jointed, and vary in length in the different\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 157. Head of Degeeria.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 158. Larva of Forficula.]\r\n\r\nThe mouth-parts are very difficult to make out, but by soaking the\r\ninsect in potash for twenty-four hours, thus rendering the body\r\ntransparent, they can be satisfactorily observed. They are constructed\r\non the same general type as the mouth-parts of the Neuroptera,\r\nOrthoptera and Coleoptera, and except in being degraded, and with\r\ncertain parts obsolete, they do not essentially differ.[11] On observing\r\nthe living Podura, the mouth seems a simple ring, with a minute labrum\r\nand groups of hairs and spinules, which the observer, partly by\r\nguess-work, can identify as jaws and maxill\xc3\xa6, and labium. But in\r\nstudying the parts rendered transparent, we can identify the different\r\nappendages. Figure 159 shows the common Tomocerus plumbeus greatly\r\nenlarged (Fig. 160, seen from above), and as the mouth-parts of the\r\nwhole group of Poduras are remarkably constant, a description of one\r\ngenus will suffice for all. The labrum, or upper lip, is separated by a\r\ndeep suture from the clypeus, and is trapezoidal in form. The mandibles\r\nand maxill\xc3\xa6 are long and slender, and buried in the head, with the tips\r\ncapable of being extended out from the ring surrounding the mouth for a\r\nvery short distance. The mandibles (_md_, Fig. 159) are like those of\r\nthe Neuroptera, Orthoptera and Coleoptera in their general form, the tip\r\nending in from three to six teeth (three on one mandible and six on the\r\nother), while below, is a rough, denticulated molar surface, where the\r\nfood seized by the terminal teeth is triturated and prepared to be\r\nswallowed. Just behind the mandibles are the maxill\xc3\xa6, which are\r\ntrilobate at the end, as in the three orders of insects above named. The\r\nouter lobe, or palpus, is a minute membranous tubercle ending in a hair\r\n(Fig. 161, _mp_), while the middle lobe, or galea, is nearly obsolete,\r\nthough I think I have seen it in Smynthurus, where it forms a lobe on\r\nthe outside of the lacinia. The lacinia, or inner lobe (Fig. 161, _lc_;\r\n162, the same enlarged), in Tomocerus consists of two bundles of\r\nspinules, one broad like a ruffle, and the other slender, pencil-like,\r\nending in an inner row of spines, like the spinules on the lacinia of\r\nthe Japyx and Campodea and, more remotely, the lacini\xc3\xa6 of the three\r\nsub-orders of insects above referred to. There is also a horny,\r\nprominent, three-toothed portion (Fig. 161, _g_). These homologies have\r\nnever been made before, so far as the writer is aware, but they seem\r\nnatural, and suggested by a careful examination and comparison with the\r\nabove-mentioned mandibulate insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 159. 161. 160. 162.\r\n\r\nTomocerus plumbeus and mouth-parts, greatly enlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe spring consists of a pair of three-jointed appendages, with the\r\nbasal joints soldered together early in embryonic life, while the other\r\ntwo joints are free, forming a fork. It is longest in Smynthurus and\r\nDegeeria, and shortest in Achorutes (Fig. 172, _b_), where it forms a\r\nsimple, forked tubercle; and is obsolete in Lipura and Anura, its place\r\nbeing indicated by an oval scar. The third joint varies in form, being\r\nhairy, serrate and knife-like in form, as in Tomocerus (Fig. 159, _a_),\r\nor minute, with a supplementary tooth, as in Achorutes (Fig. 172,\r\n_c_). This spring is in part homologous with the ovipositor of the\r\nhigher insects, which originally consists of three pairs of tubercles,\r\neach pair arising apparently from the seventh, eighth, and ninth (the\r\nlatter the penultimate) segments of the abdomen in the Hymenoptera. The\r\nspring of the Podura seems to be the homologue of the third pair of\r\nthese tubercles, and is inserted on the penultimate segment. This\r\ncomparison I have been able to make from a study of the embryology of\r\nIsotoma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 163. Catch holding spring of Achorutes.]\r\n\r\nAnother organ, and one which, so far as I am aware, has been overlooked\r\nby previous observers, I am disposed to consider as possibly an\r\novipositor. In the genus Achorutes, it may be found in the segment just\r\nbefore the spring-bearing segment, and situated on the median line of\r\nthe body. It consists (Fig. 163) of two squarish valves, from between\r\nwhich projects a pair of minute tubercles, or blades, with four rounded\r\nteeth on the under side. This pair of infinitesimal saws reminds one of\r\nthe blades of the saw-fly, and I am at a loss what their use can be\r\nunless to cut and pierce so as to scoop out a shallow place in which to\r\ndeposit an egg. It is homologous in situation with the middle pair of\r\nblades which composes the ovipositor of higher insects, and if it should\r\nprove to be used by the creature in laying its eggs, we should then\r\nhave, with the spring, an additional point of resemblance to the\r\nNeuroptera and higher insects, and instead of this spring being an\r\nimportant differential character, separating the Thysanura from other\r\ninsects, it binds them still closer, though still differing greatly in\r\nrepresenting only a part of the ovipositor of the higher insects. (This\r\nis a catch for holding the spring in place.)\r\n\r\nBut all the Poduras differ from other insects in possessing a remarkable\r\norgan situated on the basal segment of the abdomen. It is a small\r\ntubercle, with chitinous walls, forming two valves from between which is\r\nforced out a fleshy sucker, or, as in Smynthurus, a pair of long tubes,\r\nwhich are capable of being darted out on each side of the body, enabling\r\nthe insect to attach itself to smooth surfaces, and rest in an inverted\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid few in number, either singly or several together, on\r\nthe under side of stones, chips or, as in the case of Isotoma Walkerii,\r\nunder the bark of trees. They are round, transparent. The development of\r\nthe embryo of Isotoma in general accords with that of the Phryganeid\xc3\xa6\r\nand suggests on embryological grounds the near relationship of the\r\nThysanura to the Neuroptera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 164. 165. 166. 167.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of a Poduran.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest stage observed was at the time of the appearance of the\r\nprimitive band (Fig. 164, _a_, _b_, folding of the primitive band; _c_,\r\nthe dotted line crosses the primitive band, and terminates in a large\r\nyolk granule) which surrounds the egg as in the Caddis flies. Soon\r\nafter, the primitive segments appear (Fig. 165; 1, antenn\xc3\xa6; 2,\r\nmandibles; 3, maxill\xc3\xa6; the labium was not seen; 5-7, legs; _c_, yolk\r\nsurrounded by the primitive band) and seem to originate just as in the\r\nCaddis flies. Figure 166 is a front view of the embryo shortly before\r\nit is hatched; figure 167, side view of the same, the figures as in Fig.\r\n165; _sp_, spring; _l_, labrum. The labrum or upper lip, and the clypeus\r\nare large and as distinct as in the embryos of other insects, a fact to\r\nwhich we shall allude again. The large three-jointed spring is now well\r\ndeveloped, and the inference is drawn that it represents a pair of true\r\nabdominal legs. The embryo when about to hatch throws off the egg-shell\r\nand amnion in a few seconds. The larva is perfectly white and is very\r\nactive in its movements, running over the damp, inner surface of the\r\nbark. It is a little over a hundredth of an inch in length, and differs\r\nfrom the adult in being shorter and thicker, with the spring very short\r\nand stout. In fact the larva assumes the form of the lower genera of the\r\nfamily, such as Achorutes and Lipura, the adult more closely resembling\r\nDegeeria. The larva after its first moult retains its early clumsy form,\r\nand is still white. After a second moult it becomes purplish, and much\r\nmore slender, as in the adult. The eggs are laid and the young hatched\r\napparently within a period of from six to ten days.\r\n\r\nReturning to the stage indicated by figures 166 and 167, I am induced to\r\nquote some remarks published in the Memoirs of the Peabody Academy of\r\nScience, No. 2, p. 18, which seem to support the view that these insects\r\nare offshoots from the Neuroptera.\r\n\r\n"The front of the head is so entirely different from what it is in the\r\nadult, that certain points demand our attention. It is evident that at\r\nthis period the development of the insect has gone on in all important\r\nparticulars much as in other insects, especially the Neuropterous\r\nMystacides as described by Zaddach. The head is longer vertically than\r\nhorizontally, the frontal, or clypeal region is broad, and greater in\r\nextent than the epicranio-occipital region. The antenn\xc3\xa6 are inserted\r\nhigh up on the head, next the ocelli, falling down over the clypeal\r\nregion. The clypeus, however, is merged with the epicranium, and the\r\nusual suture between them does not appear distinctly in after life,\r\nthough its place is seen in figure 167 to be indicated by a slight\r\nindentation. The labrum is distinctly defined by a well marked suture,\r\nand forms a squarish, knob-like protuberance, and in size is quite large\r\ncompared to the clypeus. From this time begins the process of\r\ndegradation, when the insect assumes its Thysanurous characters, which\r\nconsist in an approach to the form of the Myriopodous head, the front,\r\nor clypeal region being reduced to a minimum, and the antenn\xc3\xa6 and eyes\r\nbrought in closer proximity to the mouth than in any other insects."\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock has given us an admirable account of the internal\r\nanatomy of these little creatures, his elaborate and patient dissections\r\nfilling a great gap in our knowledge of their internal structure. The\r\nspace at our disposal only permits us to speak briefly of the\r\nrespiratory system. Lubbock found a simple system of trache\xc3\xa6 in\r\nSmynthurus which opens by "two spiracles in the head, opposite the\r\ninsertion of the antenn\xc3\xa6," _i. e._, on the back of the head. (Von Olfers\r\nsays that they open on the prothorax.) Nicolet and Olfers claim to have\r\nfound trache\xc3\xa6 in several lower genera (Orchesella, Tomocerus, and\r\nAchorutes and allied genera), but Lubbock was unable to detect them, and\r\nI may add that I have not yet been able after careful search to find\r\nthem either in living specimens, or those rendered transparent by\r\npotash.\r\n\r\nHaving given a hasty sketch of the external aspect of the Poduras, I\r\nextract from Lubbock\'s work a synopsis of the families and genera for\r\nthe convenience of the student, adding the names of known American\r\nspecies, or indications of undescribed native forms.\r\n\r\nSMYNTHURID\xc3\x86.--Body globular or ovoid; thorax and abdomen forming one\r\nmass; head vertical or inclined; antenn\xc3\xa6 of four or eight segments.

The site of the spring is indicated by\r\nan oval scar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 174. 176. 175.\r\n\r\nAnurida maritima.]\r\n\r\nFigure 174 represents Anurida maritima found under stones between tide\r\nmarks at Nantucket. It is regarded the same as the European species by\r\nLubbock, to whom I had sent specimens for comparison. This genus differs\r\nin the form of the head from Lipura and also wants the terminal upcurved\r\nspines, while the antenn\xc3\xa6 are much more pointed. The legs (Fig. 175) end\r\nin a large, long, curved claw. On examining specimens soaked in potash,\r\nI have found that the mouth-parts of this species (Fig. 176,) _md_,\r\nmandibles; _mx_, maxill\xc3\xa6; _e_, eyes, and a singular accessory group of\r\nsmall cells, are like those of Achorutes, as previously noticed by\r\nLaboulb\xc3\xa8ne. The mandibles, like those of other Poduras, end in from\r\nthree to six teeth, and have a broad, many-toothed molar surface below.\r\nThe maxill\xc3\xa6; end in a tridentate lacinia as usual, though the palpi and\r\ngalea I have not yet studied.\r\n\r\nThe genus Anura may be readily recognized by the mouth ending in an\r\nacutely conical beak, with its end quite free from the head and hanging\r\ndown beneath it. The body is short and broad, much tuberculated, while\r\nthe antenn\xc3\xa6 are short and pointed, and the legs are much shorter than in\r\nLipura, not reaching more than a third of their length beyond the body.\r\nOur common form occurs under the bark of trees.\r\n\r\nFor the reason that I can find no valid characters for separating these\r\nthree genera as a family from the other Poduras, I am inclined to think\r\nthat they form, by the absence of the spring, only a subdivision\r\n(perhaps a subfamily) of the Podurid\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nThe best way to collect Poduras is, on turning up the stick or stone on\r\nthe under side of which they live, to place a vial over them, allowing\r\nthem to leap into it; they may be incited to leap by pushing a needle\r\nunder the vial. They may also be collected by a bottle with a sponge\r\nsaturated with ether or chloroform. They may be kept alive for weeks by\r\nkeeping moist slips of blotting paper in the vial. In this way I have\r\nkept specimens of Degeeria, Tomocerus and Orchesella, from the middle of\r\nDecember till late in January. During this time they occasionally\r\nmoulted, and Tomocerus plumbeus, after shedding its skin, ate it within\r\na few hours. Poduras feed ordinarily on vegetable matter, such as dead\r\nleaves and growing cryptogamic vegetation. These little creatures can be\r\neasily preserved in a mixture of alcohol and glycerine, or pure alcohol,\r\nthough without the glycerine the colors fade.\r\n\r\nWe have entered more fully in this chapter into the details of structure\r\nthan heretofore, too much so, perhaps, for the patience of our readers.\r\nBut the study of the Poduras possesses the liveliest interest, since\r\nthese lowest of all the six-footed insects may have been among the\r\nearliest land animals, and hence to them we may look with more or less\r\nsuccess for the primitive, ancestral forms of insect life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Nicolet, in the "Annales de la Societe Entomologique de\r\nFrance" (tome v, 1847), has given us the most comprehensive essay on the\r\ngroup, though Latreille had previously published an important essay, "De\r\nl\'Organization Exterieure des Thysanoures" in the "Nouvelles Annales du\r\nMuseum d\'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, 1832," which I have not seen.\r\nGervais has also given a useful account of them in the third volume of\r\n"Apteres" of Roret\'s Suite a Buffion,\r\npublished in 1844.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Bourlet, Templeton, Westwood, and Haliday have published\r\nimportant papers on the Thysanura; and Meinert, a Danish naturalist, and\r\nOlfers, a German anatomist, have published important papers on the\r\nanatomy of the group. In this country Say and Fitch have described less\r\nthan a dozen species, and the writer has described two American species\r\nof Campodea, C. Americana, our common form, and C.

In these most fundamental characters they differ widely from the\r\nMyriopods. I am not aware that this important relation has been\r\nappreciated by observers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: As we descend to the soft, tube-like, suctorial (?) mouth\r\nof Anura, which is said not to have hard mouth-parts, we see the final\r\npoint of degradation to which the mouth of the Thysanura is carried. I\r\nthink that this gradual degradation of the mouth-parts in this group\r\nindicates that the appendages in these animals are not formed on an\r\nindependent type, intermediate, so to speak, between the mandibulate and\r\nhaustellate types, but are simply a modification (through disuse) of the\r\nmandibulate type as seen in Neuropterous insects.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Lubbock considers that Papirius should be placed in a\r\ndistinct family from Smynthurus, because it wants trache\xc3\xa6.

Pentastoma.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 178. Centipede.]\r\n\r\nThough our course through the different groups of insects may have\r\nseemed rambling and desultory enough, and pursued with slight reference\r\nto a natural classification of the insects of which we have spoken, yet\r\nbeginning with the Hive bee, the highest intelligence in the vast world\r\nof insects, we have gradually, though with many a sudden step, descended\r\nto perhaps the most lowly organized forms among all the insects, the\r\nparasitic mites. While the Demodex is probably the humblest in its\r\norganization of any of the insects we have treated of, there is still\r\nanother mite, which, some eminent naturalists continue to regard as a\r\nworm, which is yet lower in the scale. This is the Pentastoma (Fig. 177,\r\nP. t\xc3\xa6nioides), which lives in the manner of the tape worm a parasitic\r\nlife in the higher animals, though instead of inhabiting the alimentary\r\ncanal, the worm-like mite takes up its abode in the nostrils and frontal\r\nsinus of dogs and sheep, and sometimes of the horse. At first, however,\r\nit is found in the liver or lungs of various animals, sometimes in man.\r\nIt is then in the earliest or larval state, and assumes its true mite\r\nform, being oval in shape, with minute horny jaws adapted for boring,\r\nand with two pairs of legs armed with sharp retractile claws. Such an\r\nanimal as this is little higher than some worms, and indeed is lower\r\nthan many of them.\r\n\r\nWe should also not pass over in silence the Centipedes (Fig. 178,\r\nScolopocryptops sexspinosa) and Galley worms, or Thousand legs and their\r\nallies (Myriopods), which by their long slender bodies, and great number\r\nof segments and feet, vaguely recall the worms. But they, with the\r\nmites, are true insects, as they are born with only three pairs of feet,\r\nas are the mites and ticks, and breathe by trache\xc3\xa6; and thus a common\r\nplan of structure underlies the entire class of insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 179. Young Pauropus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 180. Spring-tail.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 181. Young Julus.]\r\n\r\nA very strange Myriopod has been discovered by Sir John Lubbock in\r\nEurope, and we have been fortunate enough to find a species in this\r\ncountry. It is the Pauropus. It consists, when fully grown, of nine\r\nsegments, exclusive of the head, bearing nine pairs of feet. The young\r\nof Pauropus (Fig. 179) is born with three pairs of feet, and in its\r\ngeneral appearance reminds us of a spring-tail (Fig. 180) as may be seen\r\nby a glance at the cut. This six-legged form of Pauropus may also be\r\ncompared with the young galley worm (Fig. 181).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 182. Leptus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 183. Tardigrade.]\r\n\r\nPassing to the group of spiders and mites, we find that the young mites\r\nwhen first hatched have but three pairs of feet, while their parents\r\nhave four, like the spiders. Figure 182 represents the larva (Leptus)\r\nof the red garden mites; while a figure of the "water bear," or\r\nTardigrade (Fig. 183), is introduced to compare with it, as it bears a\r\nresemblance to the young of the mites, though their young are born with\r\ntheir full complement of legs, an exception to their nearest allies, the\r\ntrue mites. Now if we compare these early stages of mites and myriopods\r\nwith those of the true six-footed insects, as in the larval Melo\xc3\xab,\r\nCicada, Thrips and Dragon fly, we shall see quite plainly that they all\r\nshare a common form. What does this mean? To the systematist who\r\nconcerns himself with the classification of the myriads of different\r\ninsects now living, it is a relief to find that all can be reduced to\r\nthe comparatively simple forms sketched above. It is to him a proof of\r\nthe unity of organization pervading the world of insects. He sees how\r\nnature, seizing upon this archetypal form has, by simple modifications\r\nof parts here and there, by the addition of wings and other organs\r\nwanting in these simple creatures, rung numberless changes in this\r\nelemental form. And starting from the simplest kinds, such as the\r\nPoduras, Spiders, Grasshoppers and May flies, allied creatures which we\r\nnow know were the first to appear in the earlier geologic ages, we rise\r\nto the highest, the bees with their complex forms, their diversified\r\neconomy and wonderful instincts. In ascending this scale of being, while\r\nthere is a progress upwards, the beetles, for instance, being higher\r\nthan the bugs and grasshoppers; and the butterflies and moths, on the\r\nwhole, being more highly organized than the flies; and while we see the\r\nhymenopterous saw-flies, with their larv\xc3\xa6 mimicking so closely the\r\ncaterpillars of the butterflies, in the progress from the saw-flies up\r\nto the bees we behold a gradual loss of the lower saw-fly characters in\r\nthe Cynips and Chalcid flies, and see in the sand-wasps and true wasps\r\na constant and accelerating likeness to the bee form. Yet this\r\ncontinuity of improving organizations is often broken, and we often see\r\ninsects which recall the earlier and more elementary forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 184. Male Stylops.]\r\n\r\nAgain, going back of the larval period, and studying the insect in the\r\negg, we find that nearly all the insects yet observed agree most\r\nstrikingly in their mode of growth, so that, for instance, the earlier\r\nstages of the germ of a bee, fly or beetle, bear a remarkable\r\nresemblance to each other, and suggest again, more forcibly than when we\r\nexamine the larval condition, that a common design or pattern at first\r\npervades all. In the light of the studies of Von Baer, of Lamarck and\r\nDarwin, should we be content to stop here, or does this ideal archetype\r\nbecome endowed with life and have a definite existence, becoming the\r\nancestral form of all insects, the prototype which gave birth to the\r\nhundreds of thousands of insect forms which are now spread over our\r\nglobe, just as we see daily happens where a single aphis may become the\r\nprogenitor of a million offspring clustering on the same tree? Is there\r\nnot something more than analogy in the two things, and is not the same\r\nlife-giving force that evolves a million young Aphides from the germ\r\nstock of a single Aphis in a single season, the same in kind with the\r\nproduction of the living races of insects from a primeval ancestor? When\r\nwe see the Aphis giving origin in one season to successive generations,\r\nthe individuals of which may be counted by the million, it is no less\r\nmysterious than that other succession of forms of insect life which has\r\npeopled the globe during the successive chapters of its history. While\r\nwe see in one case the origin of individual forms, and cannot explain\r\nwhat it is that starts the life in the germ and so unerringly guides the\r\ncourse of the growing embryo, it is illogical to deny that the same\r\nlife-giving force is concerned in the production of specific and generic\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 185. Female Stylops.]\r\n\r\nWho can explain the origin of the sexes? What is the cause that\r\ndetermines that one individual in a brood of Stylops, for example (Fig.\r\n184, male; Fig. 185, grub-like female in the body of its host), shall be\r\nbut a grub, living as a parasite in the body of its host, while its\r\nfellow shall be winged and as free in its actions as the most highly\r\norganized insect? It is no less mysterious, because it daily occurs\r\nbefore our eyes. So perhaps none the less mysterious, and no more\r\ndiscordant with known natural laws may the law that governs the origin\r\nof species seem to those who come after us. Certainly the present\r\nattempts to discover that law, however fatuitous they may seem to many,\r\nare neither illogical, nor, judging by the impetus already given to\r\nbiology, or the science of life, labor altogether spent in vain. The\r\ntheory of evolution is a powerful tool, when judiciously used, that must\r\neventually wrest many a secret from the grasp of nature.\r\n\r\nBut whether true or unproved, the theory of evolution in some shape has\r\nactually been adopted by the large proportion of naturalists, who find\r\nit indispensable in their researches, and it will be used until found\r\ninadequate to explain facts. Notwithstanding the present distrust, and\r\neven fear, with which it is received by many, we doubt not but that in\r\ncomparatively few years all will acknowledge that the theory of\r\nevolution will be to biology what the nebular hypothesis is to geology,\r\nor the atomic theory is to chemistry. While the evolution theory is as\r\nyet imperfect, and many objections, some seemingly insuperable, can be\r\nraised against it, it should be borne in mind that the nebular\r\nhypothesis is still comparatively crude and unsatisfactory, though\r\nindispensable as a working theory to the geologist; and in chemistry,\r\nthough the atomic theory may not be satisfactorily demonstrated to some\r\nminds until an atom is actually brought to sight, it is yet invaluable\r\nin research.\r\n\r\nMany short sighted persons complain that such a theory sets in the\r\nback-ground the idea of a personal Creator; but minds no less devout,\r\nand perhaps a trifle more thoughtful, see the hand of a Creator not less\r\nin the evolution of plants and animals from pr\xc3\xabexistent forms, through\r\nnatural laws, than in the evolution of a summer\'s shower, through the\r\nlaws discovered by the meteorologist, who looks back through myriads of\r\nages to the causes that led to the distribution of mountain chains,\r\nocean currents and trade winds, which combine to produce the necessary\r\nconditions resulting in that shower.\r\n\r\nIndeed, to the student of nature, the evolution theory in biology, with\r\nthe nebular hypothesis, and the grand law in physics of the correlation\r\nof forces, all interdependent, and revealing to us the mode in which the\r\nCreator of the Universe works in the world of matter, together form an\r\nimmeasurably grander conception of the order of creation and its\r\nOrdainer, than was possible for us to form before these laws were\r\ndiscovered and put to practical use. We may be allowed, then, in a\r\nreverent spirit of inquiry, to attempt to trace the ancestry of the\r\ninsects, and without arriving, perhaps, at any certain result, for it is\r\nlargely a matter of speculation, point out certain facts, the thoughtful\r\nconsideration of which may throw light on this difficult and\r\nembarrassing question.\r\n\r\nWithout much doubt the Poduras are the lowest of the six-footed insects.\r\nThey are more embryonic in their appearance than others, as seen in the\r\nlarge size of the head compared with the rest of the body, the large,\r\nclumsy legs, and the equality in the size of the several segments\r\ncomposing the body. In other characters, such as the want of compound\r\neyes, the absence of wings, the absence of a complete ovipositor, and\r\nthe occasional want of trache\xc3\xa6, they stand at the base of the insect\r\nseries. That they are true insects, however, we endeavored to show in\r\nthe previous chapter, and that they are neuropterous, we think is most\r\nprobable, since not only in the structure of the insect after birth do\r\nthey agree with the larv\xc3\xa6 of certain neuropters, but, as we have shown\r\nin another place[14] in comparing the development of Isotoma, a Poduran,\r\nwith that of a species of Caddis fly, the correspondence throughout the\r\ndifferent embryological stages, nearly up to the time of hatching, is\r\nvery striking. And it is a remarkable fact, as we have previously\r\nnoticed, that when it begins to differ from the Caddis fly embryo, it\r\nbegins to assume the Poduran characters, and its development\r\nconsequently in some degree retrogrades, just as in the lice previous to\r\nhatching, as we have shown in a previous chapter, so that I think we are\r\nwarranted at present in regarding the Thysanura, and especially the\r\nfamily of Podarids as degraded neuropters. Consequently the Poduras did\r\nnot have an independent origin and do not, perhaps, represent a distinct\r\nbranch of the genealogical tree of articulates. While the Poduras may be\r\nsaid to form a specialized type, the Bristle-tails (Lepisma, Machilis,\r\nNicoletia and Campodea) are, as we have seen, much more highly\r\norganized, and form a generalized or comprehensive type. They resemble\r\nin their general form the larva of Ephemerids, and perhaps more closely\r\nthe immature Perla, and also the wingless cockroaches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 186. Embryo of Diplax.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 187. Embryo of Louse.]\r\n\r\nNow such forms as these Thysanura, together with the mites and the\r\nsingular Pauropus, we cannot avoid suspecting to have been among the\r\nearliest to appear upon the earth, and putting together the facts,\r\nfirst, of their low organization; secondly, of their comprehensive\r\nstructure, resembling the larv\xc3\xa6 of other insects; and thirdly, of their\r\nprobable great antiquity, we naturally look to them as being related in\r\nform to what we may conceive to have been the ancestor of the class of\r\ninsects. Not that the animals mentioned above were the actual ancestors,\r\nbut that certain insects bearing a greater resemblance to them than any\r\nothers with which we are acquainted, and belonging possibly to families\r\nand orders now extinct, were the prototypes and progenitors of the\r\ninsects now known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 188. Embryo of Spider.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 189. Embryo of Podura.]\r\n\r\nThough the study of the embryology of insects is as yet in its infancy,\r\nstill with the facts now in our possession we can state with tolerable\r\ncertainty that at first the embryos of all insects are remarkably alike,\r\nand the process of development is much the same in all, as seen in the\r\nfigure of Diplax (Fig. 186), the louse (Fig. 187), the spider (Fig. 188)\r\nand the Podura (Fig. 189), and we could give others bearing the same\r\nlikeness. We notice that at a certain period in the life of the embryo\r\nall agree in having the head large, and bearing from two to four pairs\r\nof mouth organs, resembling the legs; the thorax is merged in with the\r\nabdomen, and the general form of the embryo is ovate. Now this general\r\nembryonic form characterizes the larva of the mites, of the myriopods\r\nand of the true insects. To such a generalized embryonic form to which\r\nthe insects may be referred as the descendants, we would give the name\r\nof _Leptus_, as among Crustacea the ancestral form is referred to\r\nNauplius, a larval form of the lower Crustacea, and through which the\r\ngreater part of the Crabs, Shrimps, Barnacles, water fleas, etc., pass\r\nto attain their definite adult condition. A little water flea was\r\ndescribed as a separate genus, Nauplius, before it was known to be the\r\nlarva of a higher water flea, and so also Leptus was thought to be a\r\nmature mite. Accordingly, we follow the usage of certain naturalists in\r\ndealing with the Crustacea, and propose for this common primitive larval\r\ncondition of insects the term Leptus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 190. Zo\xc3\xaba.]\r\n\r\nThe first to discuss this subject of the ancestry of insects was Fritz\r\nM\xc3\xbcller, who in his "F\xc3\xbcr Darwin,"[15] published in 1863, says, at the end\r\nof his work, "Having reached the Nauplius, the extreme outpost of the\r\nclass, retiring farthest into the gray mist of primitive time, we\r\nnaturally look round us to see whether ways may not be descried thence\r\ntowards other bordering regions. * * * But I can see nothing certain.\r\nEven towards the nearer provinces of the Myriopoda and Arachnida I can\r\nfind no bridge. For the Insecta alone, the development of the\r\nMalacostraca [Crabs, Lobsters, Shrimps, etc.] may perhaps present a\r\npoint of union. Like many Zo\xc3\xab\xc3\xa6, the Insecta possess three pairs of limbs\r\nserving for the reception of nourishment, and three pairs serving for\r\nlocomotion; like the Zo\xc3\xab\xc3\xa6 they have an abdomen without appendages; as in\r\nall Zo\xc3\xab\xc3\xa6 the mandibles in Insecta are destitute of palpi. Certainly but\r\nlittle in common, compared with the much which distinguishes these two\r\nanimal forms. Nevertheless, the supposition that the Insecta had for\r\ntheir common ancestor a Zo\xc3\xaba which raised itself into a life on land,\r\nmay be recommended for further examination" (p. 140).\r\n\r\nAfterwards H\xc3\xa6ckel in his "Generelle Morphologie" (1866) and "History of\r\nCreation," published in 1868, reiterates the notion that the insects are\r\nderived from the larva (Zo\xc3\xaba, Fig. 190) of the crabs, though he is\r\ndoubtful whether they did not originate directly from the worms.[16]\r\n\r\nIt may be said in opposition to the view that the insects came\r\noriginally from the same early crustacean resembling the larva of a crab\r\nor shrimp, that the differences between the two types are too great, or,\r\nin other words, the homologies of the two classes too remote,[17] and\r\nthe two types are each too specialized to lead us to suppose that one\r\nwas derived from the other. Moreover, we find through the researches of\r\nMessrs. Hartt and Scudder that there were highly developed insects, such\r\nas May flies, grasshoppers, etc., in the Devonian rocks of New\r\nBrunswick, leading us to expect the discovery of low insects even in the\r\nUpper Silurian rocks. At any rate this discovery pushes back the origin\r\nof insects beyond a time when there were true Zo\xc3\xab\xc3\xa6, as the shrimps and\r\ntheir allies are not actually known to exist so far back as the\r\nSilurian, not having as yet been found below the coal measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe view that the insects were derived from a Zo\xc3\xaba was also sustained by\r\nFriedrich Brauer, the distinguished entomologist of Vienna, in a\r\npaper[18] read in March, 1869. Following the suggestion of Fritz M\xc3\xbcller\r\nand H\xc3\xa6ckel, he derives the ancestry of insects from the Zo\xc3\xaba of crabs\r\nand shrimps. However, he regards the Podurids as the more immediate\r\nancestors of the true insects, selecting Campodea as the type of such an\r\nancestral form, remarking that the "Campodea-stage has for the Insects\r\nand Myriopods the same value as the Zo\xc3\xaba for the Crustacea." He says\r\nnothing regarding the spiders and mites.\r\n\r\nAt the same time[19] the writer, in criticising H\xc3\xa6ckel\'s views of the\r\nderivation of insects from the Crustacea (ignorant of the fact that he\r\nhad also suggested that the insects were possibly derived directly from\r\nthe worms, and also independently of Brauer\'s opinions) declared his\r\nbelief that though it seemed premature, after the discovery of highly\r\norganized winged insects in rocks so ancient as the Devonian, and with\r\nthe late discovery of a land plant in the Lower Silurian rocks of\r\nSweden,[20] to even guess as to the ancestry of insects, yet he would\r\nsuggest that, instead of being derived from some Zo\xc3\xaba, "the ancestors of\r\nthe insects (including the six-footed insects, spiders and myriopods)\r\nmust have been worm-like and aquatic, and when the type became\r\nterrestrial we would imagine a form somewhat like the young Pauropus,\r\nwhich combines in a remarkable degree the characters of the myriopods\r\nand the degraded wingless insects, such as the Smynthurus, Podura, etc.\r\nSome such forms may have been introduced late in the Silurian period,\r\nfor the interesting discoveries of fossil insects in the Devonian of New\r\nBrunswick, by Messrs. Hartt and Scudder, and those discovered by Messrs.\r\nMeek and Worthen in the lower part of the Coal Measures at Morris,\r\nIllinois, and described by Mr. Scudder, reveal carboniferous myriopods\r\n(two species of Euphorberia) more highly organized than Pauropus, and a\r\ncarboniferous scorpion (Buthus?) closely resembling a species now living\r\nin California, together with another scorpion-like animal, Mazonia\r\nWoodiana, while the Devonian insects described from St. John by Mr.\r\nScudder, are nearly as highly organized as our grasshoppers and May\r\nflies. Dr. Dawson has also discovered a well developed milleped\r\n(Xylobius) in the Lower Coal Measures of Nova Scotia; so that we must go\r\nback to the Silurian period in our search for the earliest ancestor, or\r\n(if not of Darwinian proclivities) prototype, of insects."\r\n\r\nAfterwards[21] the writer, carrying out the idea suggested above,\r\n"referred the ancestry of the Myriopods, Arachnids, and Hexapodous\r\ninsects to a Leptus-like terrestrial animal, bearing a vague resemblance\r\nto the Nauplius form among Crustacea, inasmuch as the body is not\r\ndifferentiated into a head, thorax and abdomen [though the head may be\r\nfree from the rest of the body] and there are three pairs of temporary\r\nlocomotive appendages. Like Nauplius, which was first supposed to be an\r\nadult Entomostracan, the larval form of Trombidium had been described as\r\na genus of mites under the name of Leptus (also Ocypete and Astoma) and\r\nwas supposed to be adult."\r\n\r\nIn the same year Sir John Lubbock[22] agrees with Brauer that the groups\r\nrepresented by Podura and Campodea may have been the ancestors of the\r\ninsects, remarking that "the genus Campodea must be regarded as a form\r\nof remarkable interest, since it is the living representative of a\r\nprim\xc3\xa6val type from which not only the Collembola (Podura, etc.) and\r\nThysanura, but the other great orders of insects, have all derived their\r\norigin."\r\n\r\nThe comparison of the Leptus with the Nauplius, or pre-Zo\xc3\xabal stage of\r\nCrustacea, is much more natural. But here we are met with apparently\r\ninsuperable difficulties. While the Nauplius (Fig. 191) has but three\r\npairs of appendages, which become the two pairs of antenn\xc3\xa6 and\r\nsucceeding pair of limbs of the adult, in the Leptus as the least number\r\nwe have five pairs, two of which belong to the head (the maxill\xc3\xa6 and\r\nmandibles) and three to the thorax; besides these is a true heed,\r\ndistinct from the hinder region of the body. It is evident that the\r\nLeptus fundamentally differs from the Nauplius and begins life on a\r\nhigher plane. We reject, therefore, the Crustacean origin of the\r\ninsects. Our only refuge is in the worms, and how to account for the\r\ntransmutation of any worm with which we are at present acquainted into a\r\nform like the Leptus, with its mandibulated mouth and jointed legs,\r\nseems at first well nigh impossible. We have the faintest possible\r\nindication in the structure of some mites, and of the Tardigrades and\r\nPentastoma, where there is a striking recurrence, as we may term it, to\r\na worm-like form, readily noticed by every observer, whatever his\r\nopinion may be on the developmental theory. In the Demodex we see a\r\ntendency of the mite to assume under peculiar circumstances an\r\nelongated, worm-like form. The mouth-parts are aborted (though from what\r\nwe know of the embryology of other mites, they probably are indicated\r\nearly in embryonic life), while the eight legs are not jointed, and form\r\nsimple tubercles. In the Tardigrades, a long step lower, we have\r\nunjointed fleshy legs armed with from two to four claws, but the\r\nmouth-parts are essentially mite in character. A decided worm feature is\r\nthe fact that they are hermaphrodites, each individual having ovaries\r\nand spermaries, as is the case with many worms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 191. Nauplius.]\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the singular creatures of which Pentastoma and\r\nLinguatula are the type, we have the most striking approximation to the\r\nworms in external form, but these are induced evidently by their\r\nparasitic mode of life. They lose the rudimentary jointed limbs which\r\nsome (Linguatula especially) have well marked in the embryo, and from\r\nbeing oval, rudely mite-like in form, they elongate, and only the claws\r\nor simple curved hooks, like those of young tape worms, remain to\r\nindicate the original presence of true jointed legs.\r\n\r\nIn seeking for the ancestry of our hypothetical Leptus among the worms,\r\nwe are at best groping in the dark. We know of no ancestral form among\r\nthe true Annelides, nor is it probable that it was derived from the\r\nintestinal worms. The only worm below the true Annelides that suggests\r\nany remote analogy to the insects is the singular and rare Peripatus,\r\nwhich lives on land in warm climates. Its body, not divided into rings,\r\nis provided with about thirty pairs of fleshy tubercles, each ending in\r\ntwo strong claws, and the head is adorned with a pair of fleshy\r\ntubercles. It is remotely possible that some Silurian land worm, if any\r\nsuch existed, allied to our living Peripatus, may have been the ancestor\r\nof a series of types now lost which resulted in an animal resembling the\r\nLeptus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 192. Platygaster error.]\r\n\r\nWe may, however, as bearing upon this difficult question, cite some\r\nremarkable discoveries of Professor Ganin, a Russian naturalist, on the\r\nearly stages of certain ichneumon parasites, which show some worm\r\nfeatures in their embryonic development. In a species of Platygaster\r\n(Fig. 192, P. error of Fitch), which is a parasite on a two-winged gall\r\nfly, the earliest stage observed after the egg is laid is that in which\r\nthe egg contains a single cell with a nucleus and nucleolus. Out of this\r\ncell (Fig. 193 _A_, _a_) arise two other cells. The central cell (_a_)\r\ngives origin to the embryo. The two outer ones multiply by subdivision\r\nand form the embryonal membrane, or "amnion," which is a provisional\r\nenvelope and does not assist in building up the body of the germ. The\r\ncentral single cell, however, multiplies by the subdivision of its\r\nnucleus, thus building up the body of the germ. Figure 193 _B_, _g_,\r\nshows the yolk or germ just forming out of the nuclei (_a_) and _b_, the\r\nperipheral cells of the blastoderm skin, or "amnion." Figure 193 _C_\r\nshows the yolk transformed into the embryo (_g_), with the outer layer\r\nof blastodermic cells (_b_). The body of the germ is infolded, so that\r\nthe embryo appears bent on itself. Figure 193 _D_ shows the embryo much\r\nfarther advanced, with the two pairs of lobes (_md_, rudimentary\r\nmandibles; _d_, rudimentary pad-like organs, seen in a more advanced\r\nstage in _E_), and the bilobate tail (_st_). Figure 194 (_m_, mouth;\r\n_at_, rudimentary antenn\xc3\xa6; _md_, mandibles; _d_, tongue-like appendages;\r\n_st_, anal stylets; the subject of this figure is of a different species\r\nfrom the insect previously figured, which, however, it closely\r\nresembles) shows the first larva stage after leaving the egg. This\r\nstrange form, the author remarks, would scarcely be thought an insect,\r\nwere not its origin and farther development known, but rather a\r\nparasitic Copepodous crustacean, whence he calls this the Cyclops-like\r\nstage. In this condition it clings to the inside of its\r\nhost by means of its hook-like jaws (_md_), moving about like a Cestodes\r\nembryo with its well known six hooks. The tail moves up and down, and is\r\nof but little assistance in its efforts to change its place. Singularly\r\nenough, the nervous, vascular, and respiratory systems (trache\xc3\xa6) are\r\nwanting, and the alimentary canal is a blind sac, remaining in an\r\nindifferent, or unorganized state. How long it remains in this state\r\ncould not be ascertained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 193. Development of Platygaster.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 194. First Larva of Platygaster.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 195. Second Larva of Platygaster.]\r\n\r\nThe second larval stage (Fig. 195; _oe_, oesophagus; _ng_,\r\nsupra-oesophageal ganglion; _n_, nervous cord; _ga_, and _g_, genital\r\norgans; _ms_, band of muscles) is attained by means of a moult, as usual\r\nin the metamorphoses of insects. With the change of skin the larva\r\nentirely changes its form. So-called hypodermic cells are developed. The\r\nsingular tail is dropped, the segments of the body disappear, and the\r\nbody grows oval, while within begins a series of remarkable changes,\r\nlike the ordinary development of the embryo of most other insects within\r\nthe egg. The cells of the hypodermis multiply greatly, and lie one above\r\nthe other in numerous layers. They give rise to a special primitive\r\norgan closely resembling the "primitive band" of all insect embryos. The\r\nalimentary canal is made anew, and the nervous and vascular systems now\r\nappear, but the trache\xc3\xa6 are not yet formed. It remains in this state for\r\na much longer period than in the previous stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 196. Third Larva of Polynema.]\r\n\r\nThe third larval form only a few live to reach. This is of the usual\r\nlong, oval form of the larv\xc3\xa6 of the ichneumons, and the body has\r\nthirteen segments exclusive of the head. The muscular system has greatly\r\ndeveloped and the larva is much more lively in its motions than before.\r\nThe new organs that develop are the air tubes and fat bodies. The\r\n"imaginal disks" or rudimentary portions destined to develop and form\r\nthe skin of the adult, or imago, arise in the pupa state, which\r\nresembles that of other ichneumons. These disks are only engaged, in\r\nPlatygaster, in building up the rudimentary appendages, while in the\r\nflies (Muscid\xc3\xa6 and Corethra) they build up the whole body, according to\r\nthe remarkable discovery of Weismann.\r\n\r\nNot less interesting is the history of the development of a species of\r\nPolynema, another egg-parasite, which lays its eggs (one, seldom two) in\r\nthe eggs of a small dragon fly, Agrion virgo, which oviposits in the\r\nparenchyma of the leaves of waterlilies. The eggs develop as in\r\nPlatygaster. The earliest stage of the embryo is very remarkable. It\r\nleaves the egg when very small and immovable, and with scarcely a trace\r\nof organization, being a mere flask-shaped sac of cells.[23] It remains\r\nin this state five or six days.\r\n\r\nIn the second stage, or Histriobdella-like form, the larva is, in its\r\ngeneral appearance, like the low worm to which Ganin compares it. It may\r\nbe described as bearing a general resemblance to the third and fully\r\ndeveloped larval form (Fig. 196, _tg_, three pairs of abdominal\r\ntubercles destined to form the sting; _l_, rudiments of the legs; _fk_,\r\nportion of the fatty body; _at_, rudiments of the antenn\xc3\xa6; _fl_,\r\nimaginal disks, or rudiments of the wings). No trache\xc3\xa6 are developed in\r\nthe larva, nor do any exist in the imago. (Ganin thinks, that as these\r\ninsects are somewhat aquatic, the adult insects flying over the surface\r\nof the water, the wings may act as respiratory organs, like gills.) It\r\nlives six to seven days before pupating, and remains from ten to twelve\r\ndays in the pupa state.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the sting is clearly ascertained. Ganin shows that it\r\nconsists of three pairs of tubercles, situated respectively on the\r\nseventh, eighth, and ninth segments of the abdomen (Fig. 196, _tg_). The\r\nlabium is not developed from a pair of tubercles, as is usual, but at\r\nonce appears as an unpaired, or single organ. The pupa state lasts for\r\nfive or six days, and when the imago appears it eats its way through a\r\nsmall round opening in the end of the skin of its host, the Agrion\r\nlarva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 197. Development of Egg-parasites.]\r\n\r\nThe development of Ophloneurus, another egg-parasite, agrees with that\r\nof Platygaster and Polynema. This egg-parasite passes its early life in\r\nthe eggs of Pieris brassic\xc3\xa6, and two or three live to reach the imago\r\nstate, though about six eggs are deposited by the female. The eggs are\r\noval, and not stalked. The larva is at first of the form indicated by\r\nfigure 197 _E_, and when fully grown becomes of a broad oval form, the\r\nbody not being divided into segments. It differs from the genera already\r\nmentioned, in remaining within its egg membrane, and not assuming their\r\nstrange forms. From the non-segmented, sac-like larva, it passes\r\ndirectly into the pupa state.\r\n\r\nThe last egg-parasite noticed by Ganin, is Teleas, whose development\r\nresembles that of Platygaster. It is a parasite in the eggs of Gerris,\r\nthe Water Boatman. Figure 197 _A_ represents the egg; _B_, _C_, and _D_,\r\nthe first stage of the larva, the abdomen (or posterior division of the\r\nbody) being furnished with a series of bristles on each side. (_B_\r\nrepresents the ventral, _C_ the dorsal, and _D_ the profile view; _at_,\r\nantenn\xc3\xa6; _md_, hook-like mandibles; _mo_, mouth; _b_, bristles; _m_,\r\nintestine; _sw_, the tail; _ul_, under lip or labium.) In the second\r\nlarval stage, which is oval in form, and not segmented, the primitive\r\nband is formed.\r\n\r\nIn concluding the account of his remarkable discoveries, Ganin draws\r\nattention to the great differences in the formation of the eggs and the\r\ngerms of these parasites from what occurs in other insects. The egg has\r\nno nutritive cells; the formation of the primitive band, usually the\r\nfirst indication of the germ, is retarded till the second larval stage\r\nis attained; and the embryonal membrane is not homologous with the\r\nso-called "amnion" of other insects, but may possibly be compared with\r\nthe skin developed on the upper side of the low, worm-like acarian,\r\nPentastomum, and the "larval skin" of the embryos of many low Crustacea.\r\nHe says, also, that we cannot, perhaps, find the homologues of the\r\nprovisional organs of the larv\xc3\xa6, such as the singularly shaped antenn\xc3\xa6,\r\nthe claw-like mandibles, the tongue-or ear-like appendages, in other\r\nArthropoda (insects and Crustacea); but that they may be found in the\r\nparasitic Lern\xc3\xa6an crustaceans, and in the leeches, such as Histriobella.\r\nHe is also struck by the similarity in the development of these\r\negg-parasites to that of a kind of leech (Nephelis), the embryo of which\r\nis provided with cili\xc3\xa6, recalling the larva of Teleas (Fig. 197 _B_,\r\n_C_), while in the true leeches (Hirudo) the primitive band is not\r\ndeveloped until after they have passed through a provisional larval\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nThis complicated metamorphosis of the egg-parasites, Ganin also compares\r\nto the so-called "hyper-metamorphosis" of certain insects (Melo\xc3\xab,\r\nSitaris, and the Stylopid\xc3\xa6) made known by Siebold, Newport and Fabre,\r\nand he considers it to be of the same nature.\r\n\r\nHe also, in closing, compares such early larval forms as those given in\r\nfigures 193 _E_ and 194, to the free swimming Copepoda. Finally, he says\r\na few words on the theory of evolution, and remarks "there is no doubt\r\nthat, if a solution of the questions arising concerning the genealogical\r\nrelations of different animals among themselves is possible, comparative\r\nembryology will afford the first and truest principles." He modestly\r\nsuggests that the facts presented in his paper will widen our views on\r\nthe genetic relations of the insects to other animals, and refers to the\r\nopinion first expressed by Fritz M\xc3\xbcller (F\xc3\xbcr Darwin, p. 91), and\r\nendorsed by H\xc3\xa6ckel in his "Generelle Morphologie," that we must seek for\r\nthe ancestors of insects and Arachnida in the Zo\xc3\xaba form of Crustacea. He\r\ncautiously remarks, however, that "the embryos and larv\xc3\xa6 observed by me\r\nin the egg-parasites open up a new and wide field for a whole series of\r\nsuch considerations; but I will suppress them, since I am firmly\r\nconvinced that a theory, which I build up to-day, can easily be\r\ndestroyed with some few facts which I learn to-morrow. Since comparative\r\nembryology as a science does not yet exist, so do I think that all\r\ngenetic theories are too premature, and without a strong scientific\r\nfoundation."\r\n\r\nThe writer is perhaps less cautious, but he cannot refrain from making\r\nsome reflections suggested by the remarkable discoveries of Ganin. In\r\nthe first place, these facts bear strongly on the theory of evolution by\r\n"acceleration and retardation." In the history of these early larval\r\nstages we see a remarkable acceleration in the growth of the embryo. A\r\nsimple sac of unorganized cells, with a half-made intestine, so to\r\nspeak, is hatched, and made to perform the duty of an ordinary, quite\r\nhighly organized larva. Even the formation of the "primitive band,"\r\nusually the first indication of the organization of the germ, is\r\npostponed to a comparatively late period in larval life. The different\r\nanatomical systems, _i.e._, the heart with its vessels, the nervous\r\nsystem and the respiratory system (trache\xc3\xa6), appear at longer or shorter\r\nintervals, while in one genus the trache\xc3\xa6 are not developed at all. Thus\r\nsome portions of the animal are accelerated in their development more\r\nthan others, while others are retarded, and in some species certain\r\norgans are not developed at all. Meanwhile all live in a fluid medium,\r\nwith much the same habits, and surrounded with quite similar physical\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe highest degree of acceleration is seen in the reproductive organs\r\nof the Cecidomyian larva of Miastor, which produces a summer brood of\r\nyoung, alive, and living free in the body of the child-parent; and in\r\nthe pupa of Chironomus, which has been recently shown by Von Grimm, a\r\nfellow countryman of Ganin, to produce young in the spring, while the\r\nadult fly lays eggs in the autumn in the usual manner. This is in fact a\r\ntrue virgin reproduction, and directly comparable to the alternation of\r\ngenerations observed in the jelly fishes, in Salpa, and certain\r\nintestinal worms. We can now, in the light of the researches of Siebold,\r\nLeuckart, Ganin and others, trace more closely than ever the connection\r\nbetween simple growth and metamorphosis, and metamorphosis and\r\nparthenogenesis, and perceive that they are but the terms of a single\r\nseries. By the acceleration in the development of a single set of organs\r\n(the reproductive), no more wonderful than the acceleration and\r\nretardation of the other systems of organs, so clearly pointed out in\r\nthe embryos of Platygaster and its allies, we see how parthenogenesis\r\nunder certain conditions may result. The barren Platygaster larva, the\r\nfertile Cecidomyia larva, the fertile Aphis larva, the fertile\r\nChironomus pupa, the fertile hydroid polype, and the fertile adult queen\r\nbee are simply animals in different degrees of organization, and with\r\nreproductive systems differing not in quality, but in the greater or\r\nless rapidity of their development as compared with the rest of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting point is, that while the larv\xc3\xa6 vary so remarkably in\r\nform, the adult ichneumon flies are remarkably similar to one another.\r\nDo the differences in their larval history seem to point back to certain\r\nstill more divergent ancestral forms?\r\n\r\nThese remarkable hyper-metamorphoses remind us of the metamorphosis of\r\nthe embryo of Echinoderms into the Pluteus-and Bipinnaria-forms of the\r\nstarfish, sea urchins and Holothurians;[24] of the Actinotrocha-form\r\nlarva of the Sipunculoid worms; of the Tornaria into Balanoglossus, the\r\nworm; of the Cercaria-form larva of Distoma; of the Pilidium-form larva\r\nof Nemertes; and the larval forms of the leeches;[25] as well as the\r\nmite Pentastomum, and certain other aberrant mites, such as Myobia.\r\n\r\nWhile Fritz M\xc3\xbcller and Dohrn have considered the insects as having\r\ndescended from the Crustacea (some primitive zo\xc3\xaba-form), and Dohrn has\r\nadduced the supposed zo\xc3\xaba-form larva of these egg-parasites as a proof,\r\nwe cannot but think, in a subject so purely speculative as the ancestry\r\nof animals, that the facts brought out by Ganin tend to confirm our\r\ntheory, that the ancestry of all the insects (including the Arachnids\r\nand Myriopods) should be traced directly to the worms. The development\r\nof the degraded, aberrant Arachnidan Pentastomum accords, in some\r\nimportant respects, with that of the intestinal worms. The Leptus-form\r\nlarva of Julus, with its strange embryological development, in some\r\nrespects so like that of some worms, points in that direction, as\r\ncertainly as does the embryological development of the egg-parasite\r\nOphioneurus. The Nauplius form of the embryo or larva of nearly all\r\nCrustacea, also points back to the worms as their ancestors, the\r\ndivergence having perhaps originated, as we have suggested, in the\r\nRotatoria.\r\n\r\nWhile the Crustacea may have resulted from a series of prototypes\r\nleading up from the Rotifers (Fig. 198), it is barely possible that one\r\nof these creatures may have given rise to a form resulting in two series\r\nof beings, one leading to the Leptus form, the other to the Nauplius.\r\nFor the true Annelides (Ch\xc3\xa6topods) are too circumscribed and homogeneous\r\na group to allow us to look to them for the ancestral forms of insects.\r\nBut that the insects may have descended from some low worms is not\r\nimprobable when we reflect that the Syllis and allied genera of\r\nAnnelides bear appendages consisting of numerous joints; indeed, the\r\nstrange Dujardinia rotifers, figured by Quatrefages, in its general form\r\nis remarkably like the larva of Chlo\xc3\xabon. It has a quite distinct head,\r\nbearing five long, slender, jointed antenn\xc3\xa6, and but eight or nine rings\r\nto the body, which ends in two long, many jointed appendages exactly\r\nlike the tentacles. Quatrefages adds, that its movements are usually\r\nslow, but "when it wishes to move more rapidly, it moves its body\r\nalternately up and down with much vivacity, and shoots forwards by\r\nbounds, so to speak, a little after the manner of the larv\xc3\xa6 of the\r\nmosquito" (Histoire Naturelle des Annel\xc3\xa9s, Tome 2, p. 69). The gills of\r\naquatic insects only differ from those of worms in possessing trache\xc3\xa6,\r\nthough the gills of the Crustacea may be directly compared with those of\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 198. A Rotifer.]\r\n\r\nBut when once inside the circle of the class of insects the ground is\r\nfirmer, as our knowledge is surer. Granting now that the Leptus-like\r\nancestor of the six-footed insects has become established, it is not so\r\ndifficult to see how the Podur\xc3\xa6 and finally a form like Campodea\r\nappeared. Aquatic forms resembling the larva of the Ephemer\xc3\xa6, Perl\xc3\xa6 and,\r\nmore remotely, the Forficul\xc3\xa6 and white ants of to-day were probably\r\nevolved with comparative suddenness. Given the evolution of forms like\r\nthe earwigs (Forficula), cockroaches and white ants (Termes), the latter\r\nof which abounded in the coal period, and it was not a great step\r\nforward to the evolution of the Dragonflies, the Psocus, the Chrysopa,\r\nthe lice or parasitic Hemiptera, together with Thrips, thus forming the\r\nestablishment of lines of development leading up to those Neuroptera\r\nwith a complete metamorphosis, and finally to the grasshoppers and other\r\nforms of Orthoptera, together with the Hemiptera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 199. Chrysopa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 200. Panorpa.]\r\n\r\nWe have thus advanced from wingless to winged forms, _i. e._, from\r\ninsects without a metamorphosis to those with a partial metamorphosis\r\nlike the Perlas; to the May flies and Dragon flies, in which the adult\r\nis still more unlike the larva; to the Chrysopa (Fig. 199) and Forceps\r\nTails (Panorpa, Fig. 200) and Caddis flies, in which, especially the\r\nlatter, the metamorphosis is complete, the pupa being inactive and\r\nenclosed in a cocoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 201. Embryo of Diplax.]\r\n\r\nHaving assumed the creation of our Leptus by evolutional laws, we must\r\nnow account for the appearance of trache\xc3\xa6 and those organs so dependent\r\non them, the wings, which, by their presence and consequent changes in\r\nthe structure of the crust of the body, afford such distinctive\r\ncharacters to the flying insects, and raise them so far above the\r\ncreeping spiders and centipedes. Our Leptus at first undoubtedly\r\nbreathed through the skin, as do most of the Poduras, since we have been\r\nunable to find trache\xc3\xa6 in them, nor even in the prolarva of a genus of\r\nminute ichneumon egg parasites, nor in the Linguatul\xc3\xa6 and Tardigrades,\r\nand some mites, such as the Itch insect and the Demodex, and other\r\nAcari. In the Myriopod, Pauropus, Lubbock was unable to find any traces\r\nof trache\xc3\xa6. If we examine the embryo of an insect shortly before birth,\r\nas in the young Dragon fly (figure 201, the dotted line _t_ crosses the\r\nrudimentary trache\xc3\xa6), we find it to consist of two simple tubes with\r\nfew branches, while there are no stigmata, or breathing holes, to be\r\nseen in the sides of the body. This fact sustains the view of\r\nGegenbaur[26] that at first the trache\xc3\xa6 formed two simple tubes in the\r\nbody-cavity, and that the primary office of these tubes was for\r\nlightening the body, and that their function as respiratory tubes was a\r\nsecondary one. The aquatic Protoleptus, as we may term the ancestor of\r\nLeptus, may have had such tubes as these, which acted like the swimming\r\nbladder of fishes for lightening the body, as suggested by Gegenbaur. It\r\nis known that the swimming bladder of fishes becomes developed into the\r\nlungs of air-breathing vertebrates and man himself. As our Leptus\r\nadopted a terrestrial life and needed more air, a connection was\r\nprobably formed by a minute branch on each side of the body with some\r\nminute pore (for such exist, whose uses are as yet unknown) through the\r\nskin, which finally became specialized into a stigma, or breathing pore;\r\nand from the tracheal system being closed, we now have the open tracheal\r\nsystem of land insects.\r\n\r\nThe next inquiry is as to the origin of the wings. Here the question\r\narises if wingless forms are exceptional among the winged insects, and\r\nthe loss of wings is obviously dependent on the habits (as in the lice),\r\nand environment of the species (as in beetles living on islands, which\r\nare apt to lose the hinder pair of wings), why may not their acquisition\r\nin the first place have been due to external agencies; and, as they are\r\nsuddenly discarded, why may they not have suddenly appeared in the first\r\nplace? In aquatic larv\xc3\xa6 there are often external gill-like organs, being\r\nsimple sacs permeated by trache\xc3\xa6 (as in Agrion, Fig. 129, or the May\r\nflies). These organs are virtually aquatic wings, aiding the insect in\r\nprogression as well as in a\xc3\xabrating the blood, as in the true wings. They\r\nare very variable in position, some being developed at the extremity of\r\nthe abdomen, as in Agrion, or along the sides, as in the May flies, or\r\nfiliform and arranged in tufts on the under side of the body, as in\r\nPerla; and the naturalist is not surprised to find them absent or\r\npresent in accordance with the varying habits of the animal. For\r\nexample, in the larv\xc3\xa6 of the larger Dragon flies (Libellula, etc.) they\r\nare wanting, while in Agrion and its allies they are present.\r\n\r\nNow we conceive that wings formed in much the same way, and with no more\r\ndisturbance, so to speak, to the insect\'s organization, appeared during\r\na certain critical period in the metamorphosis of some early insect. As\r\nsoon as this novel mode of locomotion became established we can easily\r\nsee how surrounding circumstances would favor their farther development\r\nuntil the presence of wings became universal. If space permitted us to\r\npursue this interesting subject farther, we could show how invariably\r\ncorrelated in form and structure are the wings of insects to the varied\r\nconditions by which they are surrounded, and which we are forced to\r\nbelieve stand in the relation of cause to effect. Again, why should the\r\nwings always appear on the thorax and on the upper instead of the under\r\nside? As this is the seat of the centre of gravity, it is evident that\r\ncosmical laws as well as the more immediate laws of biology determine\r\nthe position and nature of the wings of an insect.\r\n\r\nCorrelated with the presence of wings is the wonderful differentiation\r\nof the crust, especially of the thorax, where each segment consists of a\r\nnumber of distinct pieces; while in the spiders and Myriopods the\r\nsegments are as simple as in the abdominal segments of the winged\r\ninsect. It is not difficult here to trace a series leading up from the\r\nPoduras, in which the segments are like those of spiders, to the\r\nwonderful complexity of the parts in the thoracic segments of the\r\nLepidoptera and Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\nIn his remarks "On the Origin of Insects,"[27] Sir John Lubbock says, "I\r\nfeel great difficulty in conceiving by what natural process an insect\r\nwith a suctorial mouth like that of a gnat or butterfly could be\r\ndeveloped from a powerfully mandibulate type like the Orthoptera, or\r\neven from the Neuroptera." Is it not more difficult to account for the\r\norigin of the mouth-parts at all? They are developed as tubercles or\r\nfolds in the tegument, and are homologous with the legs. Figure 186\r\nshows that the two sorts of limbs are at one time identical in form and\r\nrelative position. The thought suggests itself that these long, soft,\r\nfinger-like appendages may have been derived from the tentacles of the\r\nhigher worms, but the grounds for this opinion are uncertain. At any\r\nrate, the earliest form of limb must have been that of a soft tubercle\r\narmed with one, or two, or many terminal claws, as seen in aquatic\r\nlarv\xc3\xa6, such as Chironomus (Fig. 202), Ephydra (Fig. 203 _a_, _b_, _c_,\r\npupa) and many others. As the Protoleptus assumed a terrestrial life and\r\nneeded to walk, the rudimentary feet would tend to elongate, and in\r\nconsequence need the presence of chitine to harden the integument, until\r\nthe habit of walking becoming fixed, the necessity of a jointed\r\nstructure arose. After this the different needs of the offspring of such\r\nan insect, with their different modes of taking food, vegetable or\r\nanimal, would induce the diverse forms of simple, or raptorial, or\r\nleaping or digging limbs. A peculiar use of the anterior members, as\r\nseen in grasping the food and conveying it to the mouth (perhaps\r\noriginally a simple orifice with soft lips, as in Peripatus), would tend\r\nto cause such limbs to be grouped together, to concentrate around the\r\nmouth-opening, and to be directed constantly forwards. With use, as in\r\nthe case of legs, these originally soft mouth-feet would gradually\r\nharden at the extremities, until serviceable in biting, when they would\r\nbecome jaws and palpi. Given a mouth and limbs surrounding it, and we at\r\nonce have a rude head set off from the rest of the body. And in fact\r\nsuch is the history of the development of these parts in the embryo. At\r\nfirst the head is indicated by the buds forming the rudiments of limbs;\r\nthe segments to which they are attached do not form a true head until\r\nafter the mouth-parts have attained their jaw-like characters, and it is\r\nnot until the insect is about to be hatched, that the head is definitely\r\nwalled in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 202. Foot of Chironomus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 203. Ephydra.]\r\n\r\nWe have arrived, then, at our Leptus, with a head bearing two pairs of\r\njaws. The spiders and mites do not advance beyond this stage. But in the\r\ntrue insects and Myriopods, we have the addition of special sense\r\norgans, the antenn\xc3\xa6, and another pair of appendages, the labial palpi.\r\nIt is evident that in the ancestor of these two groups the first pair of\r\nappendages became early adapted for purely sensory purposes, and were\r\nnaturally projected far in advance of the mouth, forming the antenn\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the changes from the mandibulate form of insects to\r\nthose with mouth parts adapted for piercing and sucking, we must\r\nendeavor to learn how far it was possible for the caterpillar or maggot\r\nto become evolved from the Leptus-like larv\xc3\xa6 of the Neuroptera,\r\nOrthoptera, Hemiptera and most Coleoptera. I may quote from a previous\r\narticle[28] a few words in relation to two kinds of larv\xc3\xa6 most prevalent\r\namong insects. "There are two forms of insectean larv\xc3\xa6 which are pretty\r\nconstant. One we call _leptiform_, from its general resemblance to the\r\nlarv\xc3\xa6 of the mites (Leptus). The larv\xc3\xa6 of all the Neuroptera, except\r\nthose of the Phryganeid\xc3\xa6 and Panorpid\xc3\xa6 (which are cylindrical and\r\nresemble caterpillars), are more or less leptiform, _i. e._, have a\r\nflattened or oval body, with large thoracic legs. Such are the larv\xc3\xa6 of\r\nthe Orthoptera and Hemiptera, and the Coleoptera (except the\r\nCurculionid\xc3\xa6; possibly the Cerambycid\xc3\xa6 and Buprestid\xc3\xa6, which approach\r\nthe maggot-like form of the larv\xc3\xa6 of weevils). On the other hand, taking\r\nthe caterpillar or bee larva, with their cylindrical, fleshy bodies, in\r\nmost respects typical of larval forms of the Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera\r\nand Diptera, as the type of the _cruciform_ larva, etc. * * * The larv\xc3\xa6\r\nof the earliest insects were probably leptiform, and the cruciform\r\ncondition is consequently an acquired one, as suggested by Fritz\r\nM\xc3\xbcller."[29] It seems that these two sorts of larv\xc3\xa6 had also been\r\ndistinguished by Dr. Brauer in the article already referred to, with\r\nwhich, however, the writer was unacquainted at the time of writing the\r\nabove quoted article. The similar views presented may seem to indicate\r\nthat they are founded in nature. Dr. Brauer, after remarking that the\r\nPodurids seemed to fulfil H\xc3\xa6ckel\'s idea of what were the most primitive\r\ninsects, and noticing how closely they resemble the larv\xc3\xa6 of Myriopods,\r\nsays, "specially interesting are those forms among the Podurid\xc3\xa6 which\r\nare described as Campodea and Japyx, since the larv\xc3\xa6 of a great number\r\nof insects may be traced back to them"; but he adds, and with this view\r\nwe are unable to agree, "while others, the caterpillar-like forms\r\n(Raupenform), resulted from them by a retrograde process, and also\r\nthe still lower maggot-like forms. While on the one hand Campodea, with\r\nits abdominal feet, and the larva of Lithobius are related, so on the\r\nother the Lepismatid\xc3\xa6, which are very near the Blattari\xc3\xa6, are nearly\r\nrelated to the Myriopods, since their abdominal segments often bear\r\nappendages (Machilis). The Campodea-form appears in most of the\r\nPseudoneuroptera [Libellulids, Ephemerids, Perlids, Psocids and Termes],\r\nOrthoptera, Coleoptera, Neuroptera, perhaps modified in the Strepsiptera\r\n[Stylops and Xenos] and Coccid\xc3\xa6 in their first stage of development, and\r\nindeed in many of these at their first moult." Farther on he says, "A\r\nlarger part of the most highly developed insects assume another\r\nlarva-form, which appears not only as a later acquisition, through\r\naccommodation with certain definite relations, but also arises as such\r\nbefore our eyes. The larv\xc3\xa6 of butterflies and moths, of saw flies and\r\nPanorp\xc3\xa6, show the form most distinctly, and I call this the caterpillar\r\nform (Raupenform). That this is not the primitive form, but one later\r\nacquired, we see in the beetles. The larv\xc3\xa6 of Melo\xc3\xab and Sitaris in their\r\nfully grown condition possess the caterpillar form, but the new born\r\nlarv\xc3\xa6 of these genera show the Campodea form. The last form is lost as\r\nsoon as the larva begins its parasitic mode of life. * * * The larger\r\npart of the beetles, the Neuroptera in part, the bees and flies (the\r\nlast with the most degraded maggot form) possess larv\xc3\xa6 of this second\r\nform." He considers that the caterpillar form is a degraded Campodea\r\nform, the result of its stationary life in plants or in wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pl 2.

Tipula Larva.]\r\n\r\nFor reasons which we will not pause here to discuss, we have always\r\nregarded the eruciform type of larva as the highest. That it is the\r\nresult of degradation from the Leptus or Campodea form, we should be\r\nunwilling to admit, though the maggots of flies have perhaps retrograded\r\nfrom such forms as the larv\xc3\xa6 of the mosquitoes and crane flies\r\n(Tipulids, Fig. 204).\r\n\r\nThat the cylindrical form of the bee grub and caterpillar is the result\r\nof modification through descent is evident in the caterpillar-like form\r\nof the immature Caddis fly (Pl. 3, fig. 2). Here the fundamental\r\ncharacters of the larva are those of the Corydalus and Sialis and\r\nPanorpa, types of closely allied groups. The features that remind us of\r\ncaterpillars are superadded, evidently the result of the peculiar\r\ntube-inhabiting habits of the young Caddis fly. In like manner the\r\ncaterpillar-form is probably the result of the leaf-eating life of a\r\nprimitive Leptiform larva. In like manner the soft-bodied maggot of the\r\nweevil is evidently the result of its living habitually in cavities in\r\nnuts and fruits. Did the soft, baggy female Stylops live exposed, like\r\nits allies in other families, to an out-of-doors life, its skin would\r\ninevitably become hard and chitinous. In these and multitudes of other\r\ncases the adaptation of the form of the insect to its mode of life is\r\none of cause and effect, and not a bit less wonderful after we know what\r\ninduced the change of form.\r\n\r\nHaving endeavored to show that the caterpillar is a later production\r\nthan the young, wingless cockroach, with which geological facts\r\nharmonize, we have next to account for the origin of a metamorphosis in\r\ninsects. Here it is necessary to disabuse the reader\'s mind of the\r\nprevalent belief that the terms larva, pupa and imago are fixed and\r\nabsolute. If we examine at a certain season the nest of a humble bee, we\r\nshall find the occupants in every stage of growth from the egg to the\r\npupa, and even to the perfectly formed bee ready to break out of its\r\nlarval cell. So slight are the differences between the different stages\r\nthat it is difficult to say where the larval stage ends and the pupa\r\nbegins, so also where the pupal state ends and the imago begins. The\r\nfollowing figures (205-208) will show four of the most characteristic\r\nstages of growth, but it should be remembered that there are\r\nintermediate stages between. Now we have noticed similar stages in the\r\ngrowth of a moth, though a portion of them are concealed beneath the\r\nhard, dense chrysalis skin. The external differences between the larval\r\nand pupal states are fixed for a large part of the year in most\r\nbutterflies and moths, though even in this respect there is every\r\npossible variation, some moths or butterflies passing through their\r\ntransformations in a few weeks, others requiring several months, while\r\nstill others take a year, the majority of the moths living under ground\r\nin the pupa state for eight or nine months. The stages of metamorphosis\r\nin the Diptera are no more suddenly acquired than in the bee or\r\nbutterfly. In all these insects the rudiments of the wings, legs, and\r\neven of the ovipositor of the adult exist in the young larva. We have\r\nfound somewhat similar intermediate stages in the metamorphoses of the\r\nbeetles. The insects we have mentioned are those with a "complete\r\nmetamorphosis." We have seen that even in them the term "complete" is a\r\nrelative and not absolute expression, and that the terms larva and pupa\r\nare convenient designations for states varying in duration, and assumed\r\nto fulfil certain ends of existence, and even then dependent on length\r\nof seasons, variation in climate, and even on the locality. When we\r\ndescend to the insects with an "incomplete" metamorphosis, as in the May\r\nfly, we find that, as in the case of Chlo\xc3\xabon, Sir John Lubbock has\r\ndescribed twenty-one stages of existence, and let him who can say where\r\nthe larval ends and the pupal or imaginal stages begin. So in a stronger\r\nsense with the grasshopper and cockroach. The adult state in these\r\ninsects is attained after a number of moults of the skin, during each of\r\nwhich the insect gradually draws nearer to the final winged form. But\r\neven the so-called pup\xc3\xa6, or half winged individuals known not to be\r\nadult, in some cases feel the sexual impulse, while a number of species\r\nin each of the families represented by these two insects never acquire\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 205. Larva. 206. Semi-pupa.\r\n\r\n207. Advanced Semi-pupa. 208. Pupa.\r\n\r\nEARLY STAGES OF THE HUMBLE BEE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nStill how did the perfect metamorphosis arise? We can only answer this\r\nindirectly by pointing to the Panorpa and Caddis flies, with their\r\nnearly perfect metamorphosis, though more nearly allied otherwise to\r\nthose Neuroptera with an incomplete metamorphosis, as the lace-winged\r\nfly, than the insects of any other suborder. If, among a group of\r\ninsects such as the Neuroptera, we find different families with all\r\ngrades of perfection in metamorphosis, it is possible that larger and\r\nhigher groups may exist in which these modes of metamorphosis may be\r\nfixed and characteristic of each. Had we more space for the exposition\r\nof many known facts, the sceptic might perceive that by observing how\r\narbitrary and dependent on the habits of the insects are the\r\nmetamorphoses of some groups, the fixed modes of other and more general\r\ngroups may be seen to be probably due to biological causes, or in other\r\nwords have been acquired through changes of habits or of the temperature\r\nof the seasons and of climates. Many facts crowd upon us, which might\r\nserve as illustrations and proofs of the position we have taken. For\r\ninstance, though we have in tropics rainy and dry seasons when, in the\r\nlatter, insects remain quiescent in the chrysalis state as in the\r\ntemperate and frigid zones, yet did not the change from the earlier ages\r\nof the globe, when the temperature of the earth was nearly the same the\r\nworld over, to the times of the present distribution of heat and cold in\r\nzones, possibly have its influence on the metamorphoses of insects and\r\nother animals? It is a fact that the remains of those insects with a\r\ncomplete metamorphosis (the bees, butterflies and moths, flies and\r\nbeetles) abound most in the later deposits, while those with an\r\nincomplete metamorphosis are fewer in number and the earliest to appear.\r\nAgain, certain groups of insects are not found in the polar regions.\r\nTheir absence is evidently due to the adverse climatic conditions of\r\nthose regions. The development of the same groups is striking in the\r\ntropics, where the sum of environing conditions all tend to favor the\r\nmultiplication of insect forms.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that some insects, as the grasshopper, for\r\nexample, as M\xc3\xbcller says, "quit the egg in a form which is distinguished\r\nfrom that of the adult insect almost solely by the want of wings," while\r\nthe freshly hatched young of the bee, we may add, is farthest from the\r\nform of the adult. It is evident that in the young grasshoppers, the\r\nmetamorphoses have been passed through, so to speak, in the egg, while\r\nthe bee larva is almost embryonic in its build. The helpless young\r\nmaggot of the wasp, which is fed solely by the parent, may be compared\r\nto the human infant, while the lusty young grasshopper, which\r\nimmediately on hatching takes to the grass or clover field with all the\r\nenthusiasm of a duckling to its native pond, may be likened to that\r\nyoung feathered mariner. The lowest animals, as a rule, are at birth\r\nmost like the adult. So with the earliest known crustacea. The king\r\ncrabs, and in all probability the primeval trilobites, passed through\r\ntheir metamorphoses chiefly in the egg. So in the ancient Nebaliads\r\n(Peltocaris, Discinocaris and Ceratiocaris), if we may follow the\r\nanalogy of the recent Nebalia, the young probably closely resembled the\r\nadult, while the living crabs and shrimps usually pass through the most\r\nmarked metamorphoses. Among the worms, the highest, and perhaps the most\r\nrecent forms, pass through the most remarkable metamorphoses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 209. Jaws of Ant Lion.]\r\n\r\nAnother puzzle for the evolutionist to solve is how to account for the\r\nchange from the caterpillar with its powerful jaws, to the butterfly\r\nwith its sucking or haustellate mouth-parts. We shall best approach the\r\nsolution of this difficult problem by a study of a wide range of facts,\r\nbut a few of which can be here noticed. The older entomologists divided\r\ninsects into haustellate or suctorial, and mandibulate or biting\r\ninsects, the butterfly being an example of one, and the beetle serving\r\nto illustrate the other category. But we shall find in studying the\r\ndifferent groups that these are relative and not absolute terms. We find\r\nmandibulate insects with enormous jaws, like the Dytiscus, or Chrysopa\r\nlarva or ant lion, perforated, as in the former, or enclosing, as in the\r\nlatter two insects, the maxill\xc3\xa6 (_b_), which slide backward and forward\r\nwithin the hollowed mandibles (_a_, Fig. 209, jaws of the ant lion),\r\nalong which the blood of their victims flows. They suck the blood, and\r\ndo not tear the flesh of their prey. The enormous mandibles of the adult\r\nCorydalus are too large for use and, as Walsh observed, are converted\r\nin the male into simple clasping organs. And to omit a number of\r\ninstances, in the suctorial Hemiptera or bugs we have different grades\r\nof structure in the mouth-parts. In the biting lice (Mallophaga) the\r\nmouth is mandibulate; in the Thrips it is mandibulate, the jaws being\r\nfree, and the maxill\xc3\xa6 bearing palpi, while the Pediculi are suctorial,\r\nand the true bugs are eminently so. But in the bed bug it is easy to see\r\nthat the beak is made up of the two pairs of jaws, which are simply\r\nelongated and adapted for piercing and sucking. Among the so-called\r\nhaustellate insects the mouth-parts vary so much in different groups,\r\nand such different organs separately or combined perform the function of\r\nsucking, that the term haustellate loses its significance and even\r\nmisleads the student. For example, in the house fly the tongue (Fig. 210\r\n_l_, the mandibles, _m_, and maxill\xc3\xa6, _mp_, are useless), a fleshy\r\nprolongation of the labium or second maxill\xc3\xa6, is the sucker, while the\r\nmandibles and maxill\xc3\xa6 are used as lancets by the horse fly (Fig. 211,\r\n_m_, mandibles, _mx_, maxill\xc3\xa6). The maxill\xc3\xa6 in the butterfly are united\r\nto form the sucking tube, while in the bee the end of the labium (Fig.\r\n212) is specially adapted for lapping, not sucking, the nectar of\r\nflowers. But even in the butterfly, or more especially the moth, there\r\nis a good deal of misapprehension about the structure of the so-called\r\n"tongue." The mouth-parts of the caterpillar exist in the moth. The\r\nmandibles of the caterpillar occur in the head of the moth as two small\r\ntubercles (Fig. 213, _m_). They are aborted in the adult. While the\r\nmaxill\xc3\xa6 are as a rule greatly developed in the moth, in the caterpillar\r\nthey are minute and almost useless. The labium or second maxill\xc3\xa6, so\r\nlarge in the moth, serves simply as a spinneret in the caterpillar. But\r\nwe find a great amount of variation in the tongue or sucker of moths,\r\nand in the silk moths the maxill\xc3\xa6 are rudimentary, and there is no\r\ntongue, these organs being but little more developed than in the\r\ncaterpillar. Figure 213, B, shows the minute blade-like maxilla of the\r\nmagnificent Luna moth, an approximation to the originally blade-like\r\nform in beetles and Neuroptera. The maxill\xc3\xa6 in this insect are minute,\r\nrudimentary, and of no service to the creature, which does not take\r\nfood. In other moths of the same family we have found the maxill\xc3\xa6\r\nlonger, and touching at their tips, though too widely separate at base\r\nto form a sucking tube, while in others the maxill\xc3\xa6 are curved, and meet\r\nto form a true tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 210. Mouth-parts of the House fly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 211. Mouth-parts of Horse fly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 212. Head of Humble bee.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 213. Mouth-parts of Moths.]\r\n\r\nIn the Cecropia moth it is difficult to trace the rudiments of the\r\nmaxill\xc3\xa6 at all, and thus we have in the whole range of the moths, every\r\ngradation from the wholly aborted maxill\xc3\xa6 of the Platysamia Cecropia, to\r\nthose of Macrosila cluentius of Madagascar, which form a tongue,\r\naccording to Mr. Wallace, nine and a quarter inches in length, probably\r\nto enable their owner to probe the deep nectaries of certain orchids.\r\nThese changes in form and size are certainly correlated with important\r\ndifferences in habits, and the evolutionist can as rightly say that the\r\nstructural changes were induced by use and disuse and change of habits\r\nand the environment of the animal, as on the other hand the advocate of\r\nspecial creation claims that the two are simply correlated, and that is\r\nall we know about it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 214. Ichneumon Fly.]\r\n\r\nAnother set of organs, placed on quite another region of the body, unite\r\nto form the sting of the bee, or its equivalent the ovipositor of other\r\nhymenopterous insects, such as the Ichneumon fly (Fig. 214), the "saw"\r\nof the saw fly, and the augur of the Cicada. These are all formed on the\r\nsame plan, arising early in the larval stage as three pairs of little\r\ntubercles, which ultimately form long blades, the innermost constituting\r\nthe true ovipositor. We have found that one pair of these organs forms\r\nthe "spring" of the Podura, and that in these insects it is three\r\njointed, and thus is morphologically a pair of legs soldered together at\r\ntheir base. We would venture to regard the ovipositor of insects as\r\nprobably representing three pairs of abdominal legs, comparable with\r\nthose of the Myriopods, and even, as we have suggested in another place,\r\nthe three pairs of jointed spinnerets of spiders. Thus the ovipositor of\r\nthe bee has a history, and is not apparently a special creation, but a\r\nstructure gradually developed to subserve the use of a defensive organ.\r\n\r\nSo the organs of special sense in insects are in most cases simply\r\naltered hairs. The hairs themselves are modified epithelial cells. The\r\neyes of insects, simple and compound, are at first simply epithelial\r\ncells, modified for a special purpose, and even the egg is but a\r\nmodified epithelial cell attached to the walls of the ovary, which in\r\nturn is morphologically but a gland. Thus Nature deals in simples, and\r\nwith her units of structure elaborates as her crowning work a temple in\r\nwhich the mind of man, formed in the image of God, may dwell. Her\r\nresults are not the less marvellous because we are beginning to dimly\r\ntrace the process by which they arise. It should not lessen our awe and\r\nreverence for Deity, if with minds made to adore, we also essay to trace\r\nthe movements of His hand in the origin of the forms of life.\r\n\r\nSome writers of the evolution school are strenuous in the belief that\r\nthe evolution hypothesis overthrows the idea of archetypes, and plans of\r\nstructure. But a true genealogy of animals and plants represents a\r\nnatural system, and the types of animals, be they four, as Cuvier\r\ntaught, or five, or more, are recognized by naturalists through the\r\nstudy of dry, hard, anatomical facts. Accepting, then, the type of\r\narticulates as founded in nature from the similar modes of development\r\nand points of structure perceived between the worms and the crustacea on\r\nthe one hand, and the worms and insects on the other, have we not a\r\nstrong genetic bond uniting these three great groups into one grand\r\nsubkingdom, and can we not in imagination perceive the successive steps\r\nby which the Creator, acting through the laws of evolution, has built up\r\nthe great articulate division of the animal kingdom?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Memoirs of the Peabody Academy of Science, II.\r\nEmbryological Studies on Diplax, Perithemis, and the Thysanurus genus\r\nIsotoma.

The writer has, through the\r\nkindness of Prof. Torell, seen specimens of these plants in the Museum\r\nof the Geological Survey at Stockholm. Mr. Murray, of the Canadian\r\nGeological Survey, was the first to discover in America (Labrador,\r\nStraits of Belle Isle) this same genus of plants. They are described and\r\nfigured by Mr. Billings, who speaks of them as "slender, cylindrical,\r\nstraight, reed-like plants," in the "Canadian Naturalist" for August,\r\n1872.\r\n\r\nShould the terrestrial nature of these plants be established on farther\r\nevidence, then we are warranted in supposing that there were isolated\r\npatches of land in the Cambrian or Primordial period, and if there was\r\nland there must have been bodies of fresh water, hence there may have\r\nbeen both terrestrial and aquatic insects, possibly of forms like the\r\nPodurids, May flies, Perl\xc3\xa6, mites and Pauropus of the present day. There\r\nwas at any rate land in the Upper Silurian period, as Dr. J. W. Dawson\r\ndescribes land plants (Psilophyton) from the Lower Heiderberg Rocks of\r\nGaspe, New Brunswick, corresponding in age with the Ludlow rocks of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWe might also state in this connection that Dr. Dawson, the eminent\r\nfossil botanist of Montreal, concludes from the immense masses of carbon\r\nin the form of graphite in the Laurentian rocks of Canada, that "the\r\nLaurentian period was probably an age of most prolific vegetable growth.\r\n* * * Whether the vegetation of the Laurentian was wholly aquatic or in\r\npart terrestrial we have no means of knowing." In 1855, Dr. T. Sterry\r\nHunt asserted "that the presence of iron ores, not less than that of\r\ngraphite, points to the existence of organic life even during the\r\nLaurentian or so-called Azoic period." In 1861 he went farther and\r\nstated his belief in "the existence of an abundant vegetation during the\r\nLaurentian period." The Eophyton in Labrador occurs above the Trilobite\r\n(Paradoxides) beds, while in Sweden they occur below.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: In a communication made to the Boston Society of Natural\r\nHistory, Oct. 17, 1870 (see also "American Naturalist" for Feb. and\r\nSept., 1871).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: On the Origin of Insects, a paper read before the Linn\xc3\xa6an\r\nSociety of London Nov. 2, 1871, and reported in abstract in "Nature,"\r\nNov. 9, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: This reminds us (though Ganin does not mention it) of the\r\ndevelopment of the embryo of Julus, the Thousand legs, which, according\r\nto Newport, hatches the 25th day after the egg is laid. At this period\r\nthe embryo is partially organized, having faint traces of segments, and\r\nis still enveloped in its embryonal membranes and retains its connection\r\nwith the shell. In this condition it remains for seventeen days, when it\r\nthrows off its embryonal membrane, and becomes detached from the shell.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: It is a suggestive fact that these deciduous forms give\r\nway through histolysis to true larval forms, just as in some flies\r\n(Musca vomitoria) the true larval form goes under, and the adult form is\r\nbuilt up from the imaginal disks of the larva. In an analogous manner\r\nthe deciduous, pluteus-condition of the young Echinoderm perishes and is\r\nabsorbed by the growing body of the permanent adult stage. This\r\ndeciduous stage of the ichneumon may accordingly be termed the prelarval\r\nstage. Now as we find insects with and without this prelarval stage, and\r\nin the radiates quite different degrees of metamorphoses, the inquiry\r\narises how far these differences are correlated with, and consequently\r\ndependent upon, the physical surroundings of these animals in the free\r\nswimming condition. Merely to point out the differences in the mode of\r\ndevelopment of animals is an interesting matter, and one could do worse\r\nthings, but the philosophical naturalist cannot rest here. He must seek\r\nhow these differences were brought about.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Leuckart, in his great work, "Die Menschlichen Parasiten,"\r\np. 700, after the analogy of Hirudo, which develops a primitive streak\r\nlate in larval life, ventures to consider the first indications of the\r\ngerm of Nemertes in its larval, Pilidium form as a primitive streak. He\r\nalso suggests that the development of the later larval forms of the\r\nEchinoderms is the same in kind.\r\n\r\nMoreover, nearly twenty years ago (1854) Zaddach, a German naturalist,\r\ncontended that the worms are closely allied in their mode of development\r\nto the insects and crustaceans. He compares the mode of development of a\r\nleech (Clepsine) and certain bristle-bearing worms (S\xc3\xa6nuris, Lumbricatus\r\nand Uaxes); and we may now from Kowalensky\'s researches (1871) add the\r\ncommon earth worm (Lumbricus), in which there is no such metamorphosis\r\nas in the sea Nereids, to that of insects; the mode of formation of the\r\nprimitive band in the leeches and earth worms being much like that of\r\ninsects. This confirms the view of Leuckart and Ganin, who both seem to\r\nhave overlooked Zaddach\'s remarks. Moreover, the rings of the harder\r\nbodied worms, as Zaddach says, contain chitine, as in the insects.\r\nZaddach also enters into farther details, which in his opinion ally the\r\nworms nearer to the insects than many naturalists at his time were\r\ndisposed to allow. The singular Echinoderes has some remarkable\r\nArthropod characters.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Vergleichende Anatomie, 2te Auflage, 1870, p. 437. I\r\nshould, however, here add that I am told by Mr. Putnam that some fishes\r\nwhich have no swim-bladder, are surface-swimmers, and _vice versa_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Reported In "Nature" for Nov. 9, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: The Embryology of Chrysopa, and its bearings on the\r\nClassification of the Neuroptera, "American Naturalist," vol. v.

Insects\r\nappear in Texas about six weeks earlier than in Virginia, in the Middle\r\nStates six weeks earlier than in northern New England and the\r\nNorth-western States, and in New England about six weeks earlier than in\r\nLabrador. The time of the appearance of insects corresponds to the time\r\nof the flowering or leafing out of certain trees and herbs; for\r\ninstance, the larv\xc3\xa6 of the American Tent caterpillar and of the Canker\r\nworm hatch just as the apple tree begins to leaf out; a little later the\r\nPlant lice appear, to feast on the tender leaves; and when, during the\r\nfirst week in June, our forests and orchards are fully leafed out, hosts\r\nof insects are marshalled to ravage and devour their foliage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Insects of Early Spring._\r\n\r\nIn April the gardener should scrape and wash thoroughly all his fruit\r\ntrees, so as to rub off the eggs of the bark lice which hatch out early\r\nin May. Many injurious caterpillars and insects of all kinds winter\r\nunder loose pieces of bark, or under matting and straw at the base of\r\nthe trees. Search should also be made for the eggs of the Canker worm\r\nand the American Tent caterpillar, which last are laid in bunches half\r\nan inch long on the terminal shoots of many of our fruit trees. A little\r\nlabor spent in this way will save many dollars\' worth of fruit. The\r\n"castings" of the Apple Tree Borer (Saperda bivittata) should be looked\r\nfor at the base of the tree, and its ravages be promptly arrested. Its\r\npresence can also be detected, it is said, by the dark appearance of the\r\nbark, where the grub is at work: cut in and pull out the young grub. It\r\nis the best time of the year to catch and kill this pest. Cylindrical\r\nbark borers, which are little round, black, weevil-like beetles, often\r\ncausing "fire-blight" in pears, etc., are now flying about fruit trees\r\nto lay their eggs; and many other weevils and boring beetles, especially\r\nthe Pea weevil (Bruchus pisi, Fig. 215), the Pine weevil (Pissodes\r\nstrobi, Fig. 216), and Hylobius pales and Hylurgus terebrans, also\r\ninfesting the pine, now abound, and the collector can obtain many\r\nspecimens not met with at other times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 215. Pea Weevil and Maggot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 216 Pine Weevil and Young.]\r\n\r\nThe housewife must now guard against the intrusion of Clothes moths\r\n(Tinea), while many other species of minute moths (Tineids) and of\r\nLeaf-rollers (Tortricid\xc3\xa6) will be flying about orchards and gardens just\r\nas the buds are beginning to unfold; especially the Coddling moth\r\n(Carpocapsa pomonella). On warm days myriads of these and other insects\r\nmay be seen filling the air; it is the busiest time of their lives, as\r\nall are on errands of love to their kind, but of mischief to the\r\nagriculturist.\r\n\r\nWhen the May Flower--"O commendable flowre and most in minde"--blooms,\r\nand the willows hang out their golden catkins, we shall hear the hum of\r\nthe wild bee, and the insect hunter will reap a rich harvest of\r\nrarities. Seek now on the abdomen of various wild bees, such as Andrena,\r\nfor that most eccentric of all our insects, the Stylops Childreni. The\r\ncurious larv\xc3\xa6 of the Oil beetle may be found abundantly on the bodies of\r\nvarious species of Bombus, Andrena and Halictus, with their heads\r\nplunged in between the segments of the bee\'s body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 217. The Comma Butterfly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 218. Tachina.]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful moth, Adela, with its immensely long antenn\xc3\xa6, may be seen,\r\nwith other smaller moths, feeding on the blossoms of the willow. The\r\nAnts wake from their winter\'s sleep and throw up their hillocks, and the\r\n"thriving pismire" issues from his vaulted galleries constructed in some\r\ndecaying log or stump, while the Angle worms emulate late their\r\nsix-footed neighbors. During the mild days of March, ere the snow has\r\nmelted away--\r\n\r\n  "The dandy Butterfly,\r\n  All exquisitely drest,"\r\n\r\nwill visit our gardens. Such are various kinds of Vanessa and Grapta\r\n(Fig. 217, G. c-argenteum[30]). The beautiful Brephos infans flies\r\nbefore the snow disappears.\r\n\r\n  "The Gnat, old back-bent fellow,\r\n  In frugal frieze coat drest,"\r\n\r\nwill celebrate the coming of Spring, with his choral dance. Such is\r\nTrichocera hyemalis, which may be seen in multitudes towards twilight on\r\nmild evenings. Many flies are now on the wing, such as Tachina (Fig.\r\n218) and its allies; the four spotted Mosquito, Anopheles\r\nquadrimaculatus, and the delicate species of Chironomus, whose males\r\nhave such beautifully feathered antenn\xc3\xa6, assemble in swarms. Now is the\r\ntime for the collector to turn up stones and sticks by the river\'s side\r\nand in grassy damp pastures, for Ground beetles (Carabid\xc3\xa6), and to\r\nfrequent sunny paths for the gay Cicindela and the Bombylius fly, or\r\nfish in brooks and pools for water beetles and various larv\xc3\xa6 of\r\nNeuroptera and Diptera; while many flies and beetles are attracted to\r\nfreshly cut maples or birches running with sap; indeed, many insects,\r\nrarely found elsewhere, assemble in quantities about the stumps of these\r\ntrees, from which the sap oozes in March and April.\r\n\r\nIn April the injurious insects in the Northern States have scarcely\r\nbegun their work of destruction, as the buds do not unfold before the\r\nfirst of May. We give an account, however, of some of the beneficial\r\ninsects which are now to be found in grass-lands and in gardens. The\r\nfarmer should know his true insect friends as well as his insect foes.\r\nWe introduce to our readers a large family of ground-beetles (Carabid\xc3\xa6,\r\nfrom Carabus, the name of the typical genus) which prey on those insects\r\nlargely injurious to crops. A study of the figures will familiarize our\r\nreaders with the principal forms. They are dark-colored, brown or black,\r\nwith metallic hues, and are seen in spring and throughout the summer,\r\nrunning in grass, or lurking under stones and sticks in damp places,\r\nwhence they sally forth to hunt by night, when many vegetable-eating\r\ninsects are most active.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 219. Calosoma scrutator.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 220. Calosoma calidum and Larva.]\r\n\r\nThe larv\xc3\xa6 are found in much the same situations as the mature beetles.\r\nThey are, elongate, oblong, and rather broad, the terminal ring of the\r\nbody being armed with two horny hooks, and having a single fleshy leg\r\nbeneath; and are usually black in color. The larva of Calosoma (C.\r\ncalidum, Fig. 220; _a_, the beetle; and Fig. 219, C. scrutator) ascends\r\ntrees to feed on caterpillars, such as the Canker worm. When about to\r\ntransform to the pupa state, it forms a rude cocoon in the earth. The\r\nbeetle lies in wait for its prey in shallow pits excavated in pastures.\r\nWe once saw it fiercely attack a May beetle (Lachnosterna fusca) nearly\r\ntwice its size; it tore open the hard sides of its clumsy and helpless\r\nvictim with tiger-like ferocity. Carabus (Fig. 221, C. serratus Say, and\r\npupa of Carabus auronitens of Europe, after Westwood) is a closely\r\nallied form, with very similar habits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 221. Carabus and Pupa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 222. Brachinus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 223. Casnonia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 224. Pangus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 225. Agonum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 226. Carabid Larva.]\r\n\r\nA much smaller form is the curious Bombardier beetle, Brachinus (Fig.\r\n222, B. fumans), with its narrow head and heart-shaped prothorax. It is\r\nremarkable for discharging with quite an explosion from the end of its\r\nbody a pungent fluid, probably as a protection against its enemies. An\r\nallied genus is Casnonia (Fig. 223, C. Pensylvanica), which has a long\r\nneck and spotted wing covers. Figure 224, Pangus caliginosus, and figure\r\n225, Agonum cupripenne, represent two common forms. The former is black,\r\nwhile the latter is a pretty insect, greenish, with purplish-red\r\nwing-covers, and black legs.\r\n\r\nFigure 226, enlarged about three times, represents a singular larva\r\nfound by Mr. J. H. Emerton under a stone early in spring. Dr. LeConte,\r\nto whom we sent a figure, supposes that it may possibly be a larva of\r\nHarpalus, or Pangus caliginosus. It is evidently a young Carabid. The\r\nunder side is represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Insects of May._\r\n\r\nDuring this month there is great activity among the insects. As the\r\nflowers bloom and the leaves appear, multitudes wake from their long\r\nwinter sleep, and during this month pass through the remainder of their\r\ntransformations, and prepare for the summer campaign. Most insects\r\nhibernate in the chrysalis or pupa state, while many winter in the\r\ncaterpillar or larva state, such as the larv\xc3\xa6 of several Noctuid\xc3\xa6 and\r\nthe "yellow-bear," and other caterpillars of Arctia and its allies.\r\nOther insects hibernate in the adult or imago form, either as beetles,\r\nbutterflies or certain species of bees.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the Queen Humble bee winters under the moss, or in\r\nher old nest. During the present month her rovings seem to have a more\r\ndefinite object, and she seeks some deserted mouse\'s nest, or hollow in\r\na tree or stump, and there stows away her pellets of pollen, containing\r\ntwo or three eggs apiece, which, late in the summer, are to form the\r\nnucleus of a well-appointed colony. The Carpenter bees (Ceratina and\r\nXylocopa, the latter of which is found in abundance south of New\r\nEngland) are busy in refitting and tunnelling the hollows of the grape;\r\nwhile the Ceratina hollows out the stem of the elder, or blackberry.\r\nThis little upholsterer bee carpets her honey-tight apartment, storing\r\nit with food for her young, and later in the season, in June, several of\r\nthese cartridge-like cells, whose silken walls resemble the finest and\r\nmost delicate parchment, may be found in the hollow stems of these\r\nplants. The Mason bee (Osmia) places her nest in a more exposed site,\r\nbuilding her earthen cells of pellets of moistened mud, either situated\r\nunder a stone, or in some more sheltered place; for instance, in a\r\ndeserted oak-gall, ranging half a dozen of them side by side along the\r\nvault of this strange domicile. Meanwhile their more lowly relatives,\r\nthe Andrena and Halictus bees, are engaged in tunnelling the side of\r\nsome sunny bank or path, running long galleries underground, sometimes\r\nfor a foot or more, at the farthest end of which are to be found, in\r\nsummer, little earthen urn-like cells, in which the grubs live upon the\r\npollen stored up for them in little balls of the size of a pea. Later in\r\nthe month, the Gall flies (Cynips), those physiological puzzles, sting\r\nthe leaves of our oaks of different species, giving rise to the strange\r\nexcrescences and manifold deformities which deface the stems and leaves\r\nof our most beautiful forest trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 227. Chrysophanus Thoe.[31]] 31 A: The lower side of the\r\nwings is figured on the right side of this and Figs. 228 and 229.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 228. Argynnis Aphrodite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 229. Melit\xc3\xa6a Phaeton.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Kalmia, Rhodora, and wild cherries are in bloom, many of our\r\nmost beautiful butterflies appear; such are the different species of\r\nChrysophanus (Fig. 227), Lyc\xc3\xa6na, Thecla and Argynnis (Fig. 228). At this\r\ntime we have found the rare larva of Melit\xc3\xa6a Phaeton (Fig. 229) clothed\r\nin the richest red and velvety black, feeding daintily upon the hazel\r\nnut, and tender leaves of the golden rod. In June, it changes to the\r\nchrysalis state, and early in July the butterfly rises from the cold,\r\ndamp bogs, where we have oftenest found it, clad in its rich dress of\r\nvelvety black and red.\r\n\r\nLater still, when the lilac blooms, and farther south the broad-leaved\r\nKalmia, the gaily-colored Humming Bird moth (Sesia) visits the flowers\r\nin company with the Swallow-tail butterfly (Papilio Turnus). At\r\ntwilight, the Hawk moth (Sphinx) darts noiselessly through our gardens,\r\nas soon as the honeysuckles, pinks and lilies are in blossom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 230. D. 12-punctata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 231. Diabrotica vittata.]\r\n\r\nAmong the flies, mosquitoes now appear, though they have not yet,\r\nperhaps, strayed far from their native swamps and fens; and their\r\nmammoth allies, the Daddy-long-legs (Tipula), rise from the fields and\r\nmould of our gardens in great numbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232. Plum Weevil and Young.]\r\n\r\nOf the beetles, those which feed on leaves now become specially active.\r\nThe Squash beetle (Diabrotica vittata, Fig. 231, and Fig. 230, D.\r\n12-punctata) now attacks the squash plants before they are fairly up;\r\nand the Plum weevil (Conotrachelus nenuphar, Fig. 232) will sting the\r\nnewly formed fruit, late in the month, or early in June. Many other\r\nweevils now abound, stinging the seeds and fruit, and depositing their\r\neggs just under the skin. So immense are the numbers of insects which\r\nfill the air and enliven the fields and woodlands just as summer comes\r\nin, that a bare enumeration of them would overcrowd our pages, and tire\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 233. May Fly.]\r\n\r\nA word, however, about our water insects. Late in the month the May fly\r\n(Ephemera, Fig. 233) appears, often rising in immense numbers, from the\r\nsurface of pools and sluggish brooks. In Europe, whole clouds of these\r\ndelicate forms, with their thin white wings, have been known to fall\r\nlike snow upon the ground, when the peasants gather them up in heaps to\r\nenrich their gardens and farms.\r\n\r\nThe Case worms, or Caddis flies (Fig. 234), begin now to leave their\r\nportable houses, formed of pieces of leaves, or sticks and fine gravel,\r\nor even of shells, as in an European species, and fly over the water,\r\nresting on the overhanging trees.\r\n\r\nA few busy Mosquito Hawks, or Dragon flies (Libellula), herald the\r\ncoming of the summer brood of these indefatigable friends of the\r\nagriculturist. During their whole life below the waters, these\r\nentomological Herods have slain and sucked the blood of myriads of\r\ninfant mosquitoes and other insects; and now in their new world above\r\nthe waters, with still more intensified powers of doing mischief,\r\nhappily, however, to flies mostly obnoxious to man, they riot in\r\nbloodshed and carnage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 234. Different Forms of Case Worms.]\r\n\r\nThis is the season to stock the fresh-water aquarium. Go to the nearest\r\nbrook, gather a sprig or two of the water cress, which spreads so\r\nrapidly, a root of the eel grass, and plant them in a glass dish or deep\r\njar. Pour in your water, let the sand and sediment settle, and then put\r\nin a few Tadpoles, a Newt (Salamander), Snails (Limn\xc3\xa6a, Planorbis and\r\nValvata), Caddis flies and Water beetles, together with the gatherings\r\nfrom a thicket of eel grass, or other submerged plants, being rich in\r\nthe young of various flies, Ephemeras, Dragon flies and Water fleas\r\n(Entomostraca, Fig. 235), which last are beautiful objects for the\r\nmicroscope, and in a few days the occupants will feel at home, and the\r\naquarium will be swarming with life, affording amusement and occupation\r\nfor many a dull hour, by day or at night, in watching the marvels of\r\ninsect transformations, and plant-growth.\r\n\r\nAmong the injurious hymenoptera, which abound late in this month, is\r\nthe Rose Saw fly (Selandria ros\xc3\xa6, Fig. 236) and S. cerasi. The eggs are\r\nthen laid, and the last of June, or early in July, the slug-like larv\xc3\xa6\r\nmature, and the perfect insects fly in July. Various Gall flies now lay\r\ntheir eggs in the buds, leaves and stems of various kinds of oaks,\r\nblackberries, blueberries and other plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 235. Water Flea.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 236. Selandria ros\xc3\xa6.]\r\n\r\nDipterous Gall flies are now laying their eggs in cereals. The Hessian\r\nfly (Cecidomyia destructor) has two broods, the fly appearing both in\r\nspring and autumn. The fly lays twenty or thirty eggs in a crease in the\r\nleaf of the young plant. In about four days, in warm weather, they\r\nhatch, and the pale-red larv\xc3\xa6 crawl down the leaf, working their way in\r\nbetween it and the main stalk, passing downward till they come to a\r\njoint, just above which they remain, a little below the surface of the\r\nground, with the head towards the root of the plant. Here they imbibe\r\nthe sap by suction alone, and, by the simple pressure of their bodies\r\nbecome imbedded in the side of the stem. Two or three larv\xc3\xa6 thus\r\nimbedded serve to weaken the plant and cause it to wither and die. The\r\nsecond brood of larv\xc3\xa6 remains through the winter in the flax-seed, or\r\npuparium. By turning the stubble with the plough in the autumn and early\r\nspring, its imago may be destroyed, and thus its ravages may be checked.\r\n(Figure 237 represents the female, which is about one-third as large as\r\na mosquito: _a_, the larva; _b_, the pupa; and _c_ represents the joint\r\nnear the ground where the maggots live.) The same may be said of the\r\nWheat midge (Cecidomyia tritici), which attacks the wheat in the ear,\r\nand which transforms an inch deep beneath the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 237. Hessian Fly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 238. Turnip Butterfly.]\r\n\r\nAmong the butterflies which appear this month are the Turnip butterfly\r\n(Pontia oleracea, Fig. 238,) which lays its eggs the last of the month.\r\nThe eggs hatch in a week or ten days, and in about two weeks the larva\r\nchanges to a chrysalis. Thanaos junevalis and T. Brizo fly late in May.\r\nThe caterpillars live on the pea and other papilionaceous plants. Thecla\r\nAuburniana, T. Niphon, and other species fly in dry, sunny fields, some\r\nin April. Argynnis Myrina flies from the last of May through June, and a\r\nsecond brood appears in August and September. Vanessa J-album and V.\r\ninterrogationis appear in May, and again in August and September. The\r\ncaterpillars of the latter species live on the elm, lime and hop-vine.\r\nGrapta comma also feeds on the hop. Alypia 8-maculata (Fig. 49) flies at\r\nthis time, and in August its larva feeds on the grape. Sphinx gordius,\r\nS. 5-maculata (Fig. 239) and other Sphinges and Sesia (the Clear-winged\r\nmoth), appear the last of May. Arctia Arge, A. virgo, A. phalerata and\r\nother species fly from the last of May through the summer. Hyphantria\r\ntextor, the Fall-weaver, is found in May or June. The moth of the\r\nSalt-marsh caterpillar appears at this time, and various Cut worms\r\n(Agrotis, Fig. 240) abound, hiding in the daytime under stones and\r\nsticks, etc., while various Tineids and Tortrices, or Leaf-rolling\r\ncaterpillars, begin to devour tender leaves and buds and opening\r\nblossoms of flowers and fruit trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 239. Sphinx 5-maculata, Larva and Pupa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 240. Cut Worm and Moth.]\r\n\r\nThe White-pine weevil flies about in warm days. We have found its\r\nburrows winding irregularly over the inner surface of the bark and\r\nleading into the sap-wood. Each cell, in which it hibernates, in the\r\nmiddle of March, contains the yellowish white footless grub. Early in\r\nApril it changes to a pupa, and a month after the beetle appears, and in\r\na few days deposits its egg under the bark of old pine trees. It also\r\noviposits in the terminal shoots of pine saplings, dwarfing and\r\npermanently deforming the tree. Associated with this weevil we have\r\nfound the smaller, rounder, more cylindrical, whitish grubs of the\r\nHylurgus terebrans, which mines the inner layers of the bark, slightly\r\ngrooving the sap-wood. Later in April it pupates, and its habits accord\r\nin general with those of Pissodes strobi. Another Pine weevil also\r\nabounds at this time, as well as Otiorhynchus picipes (Fig. 241), which\r\ninjures beans, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 241. Garden Weevil.]\r\n\r\nCylindrical bark-borers, which are little, round, weevil-like beetles,\r\nare now flying about fruit trees, to lay their eggs in the bark.\r\nAssociated with the Pissodes, we may find in April the galleries of\r\nTomicus pini, branching out from a common centre. They are filled up\r\nwith fine sawdust, and, according to Dr. Fitch, are notched in the sides\r\n"in which the eggs have been placed, where they would remain undisturbed\r\nby the beetle as it crawled backwards and forth through the gallery."\r\nThese little beetles have not the long snouts of the weevils, hence they\r\ncannot bore through the outer bark, but enter into the burrows made the\r\npreceding year, and distribute the eggs along the sides (Fitch). Another\r\nTomicus, more dangerous than the preceding, feeds exclusively in the\r\nsap-wood, running solitary galleries for a distance of two inches\r\ntowards the centre of the tree. We figure Tomicus xylographus Say (Fig.\r\n242, enlarged). It is the most formidable enemy to the white pine in the\r\nNorth, and the yellow pine in the South that we have. It also flies in\r\nMay. Ptinus fur (Fig. 243, much enlarged) is now found in out-houses,\r\nand is destructive to cloth, furs, etc., resembling the Larder-beetle\r\n(Dermestes) in its habits. It is fourteen hundredths of an inch in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 242. Pine Weevil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 243. Ptinus and Larva.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Insects of June._\r\n\r\nEarly in the month the Parsnip butterfly (Papilio Asterias) may be seen\r\nflying about, preparatory to laying its eggs for the brood of\r\ncaterpillars which appear in August. At the time of the flowering of the\r\nraspberry and blackberry, the young larva of Vanessa Antiopa, one of our\r\nmost abundant butterflies, may be found living socially on the leaves of\r\nthe willow; while the mature larva of another much smaller butterfly,\r\nthe little Copper skipper (Chrysophanus Americans), so abundant at this\r\ntime, may sometimes be found on the clover. It is a short, oval,\r\ngreenish worm, with very short legs. The dun-colored skippers (Hesperia)\r\nabound towards the middle of the month, darting over the flowers of the\r\nblueberry and blackberry, in sunny openings in the forests.\r\n\r\nThe family of Hawk moths (Sphinges) now appear in greater abundance,\r\nhovering at twilight over flower-beds, and, during this time, deposit\r\ntheir eggs on the leaves of various fruit-trees. The American Tent\r\ncaterpillar makes its cocoon, and assumes the pupa state. The\r\ncaterpillar passes several days within the cocoon, in what may be\r\ncalled the semi-pupa states during which period the chrysalis skin is\r\nforming beneath the contracted and loosened larva skin. We once\r\nexperimented on a larva which had just completed its cocoon, to learn\r\nhow much silk it could produce. On removing its cocoon it made another\r\nof the same thickness; but on destroying this second one it spun a third\r\nbut frail web, scarcely concealing its form. A minute Ichneumon\r\nparasite, allied to Platygaster, lays its eggs within those of this\r\nmoth, as we once detected one under a bunch of eggs, and afterwards\r\nreared a few from the same lot of eggs. A still more minute egg-parasite\r\n(Fig. 244) we have seen ovipositing in the early spring, in the eggs of\r\nthe Canker-worm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 244. Canker worm Egg-parasite.]\r\n\r\nAmong that beautiful family of moths, the Phal\xc3\xa6nid\xc3\xa6, comprising the\r\nGeometers, Loopers, or Span-worms, are two formidable foes to fruit\r\ngrowers. The habits of the Canker worm should be well known. With proper\r\ncare and well-directed energy, we believe their attacks can be in a\r\ngreat measure prevented. The English sparrow, doves and other\r\ninsectivorous birds, if there are any others that eat them, should be\r\ndomesticated in order to reduce the number of these pests. More care\r\nthan has yet been taken should be devoted to destroying the eggs laid in\r\nthe autumn, and also the wingless females, as they crawl up the trees in\r\nthe spring and autumn to lay their eggs. The evil is usually done before\r\nthe farmer is well aware that the calamity has fallen upon him. As soon\r\nas, and even before the trees have fairly leafed out, they should be\r\nvisited morning, noon and night, shaken and thoroughly examined and\r\ncleared of the caterpillars. By well-concerted action among\r\nagriculturists, who should form a Board of Destruction, numbering every\r\nman, woman and child on the farm, this fearful scourge may be abated by\r\nthe simplest means, as the cholera or any epidemic disease can in a\r\ngreat measure be averted by taking proper sanitary precautions. The\r\nCanker worms hatch out during the early part of May, from eggs laid in\r\nthe fall and spring, on the branches of various fruit-trees. Just as the\r\nbuds unfold, the young caterpillars make little holes through the tender\r\nleaves, eating the pulpy portions, not touching the veins and midribs.\r\nWhen four weeks old they creep to the ground, or let themselves down by\r\nspinning a silken thread, and burrow from two to six inches in the soil,\r\nwhere they change to chrysalids in a day or two, and in this state live\r\ntill late in the fall, or until the early spring, when they assume the\r\nimago or moth form. The sexes then unite, and the eggs are deposited for\r\nthe next generation.\r\n\r\nThe Canker worm is widely distributed, though its ravages used to be\r\nconfined mostly to the immediate vicinity of Boston. We have seen\r\nspecimens of the moth from Illinois. Riley has found it in Missouri.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 245. Abraxas ribearia.]\r\n\r\nThe Abraxas ribearia of Fitch (Fig. 245, moth), the well-known Currant\r\nworm, defoliates whole rows of currant bushes. This pretty caterpillar\r\nmay be easily known by its body being of a deep golden color, spotted\r\nwith black. The bushes should be visited morning, noon and night, and\r\nthoroughly shaken (killing the caterpillars) and sprinkled with ashes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 246. May Beetle and Young.]\r\n\r\nAmong multitudes of beetles (Coleoptera) injurious to the crops, are the\r\nMay beetle (Lachnosterna fusca, Fig. 246), whose larva, a large white\r\ngrub, is injurious to the roots of grass and to strawberry vines. The\r\nRose beetle appears about the time of the blossoming of the rose. The\r\nFire-flies now show their light during mild evenings, and on hot sultry\r\ndays the shrill rasping song of the male Cicada, for "they all have\r\nvoiceless wives," cuts the air: The Chinch-bug, that fell destroyer of\r\nour wheat crops, appears, according to Harris, in the middle of the\r\nmonth, and "may be seen in their various stages of growth on all kinds\r\nof grain, on corn and herds-grass during the whole summer." So widely\r\nspread is this insect at present, that we have even detected it in\r\nAugust on the summit of Mount Washington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 247. Pemphigus.]\r\n\r\nThe Diptera, or two-winged flies, contain hosts of noxious insects, such\r\nas the various Cecidomyians, or two-winged Gall flies, which now sting\r\nthe culms of the wheat and grasses, and various grains, and leaves of\r\ntrees, producing gall-like excrescences of varying form. Legions of\r\nthese delicate minute flies fill the air at twilight, hovering over\r\nwheat fields and shrubbery. A strong north west wind, at such times, is\r\nof incalculable value to the farmer. Moreover, minute flies, allied to\r\nthe house fly, such as Tephritis, Oscinis, etc., now attack the young\r\ncereals, doing immense injury to grain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 248. Apple Bark Louse.]\r\n\r\nMillions of Aphides, or Plant lice, now infest our shade and fruit\r\ntrees, crowding every green leaf, into which they insert their tiny\r\nbeaks, sucking in the sap, causing the leaves to curl up and wither.\r\nThey also attack the stems and even the roots of plants, though these\r\nlatter (Pemphigus, Fig. 247) differ generically from the true Plant\r\nlice. Fruit trees should be again washed and rubbed to kill off the\r\nyoung Bark lice, of which the common apple Bark louse (Aspidiotus\r\nconchiformis, Fig. 248), whose oyster-shaped scales may be found in\r\nmyriads on neglected trees, is a too familiar example. Another pest of\r\napple trees is the woolly Blight (Eriosoma lanigera). These insects\r\nsecrete from the surface of the body a downy, cottony substance which\r\nconceals the animal, and when they are, as usual, grouped together on\r\nthe trees, makes them look like patches of mould. The natural insect\r\nenemies of the Plant lice now abound; such are the Lady bugs\r\n(Coccinella, Fig. 249); the larva of the Syrphus fly (Fig. 76), which\r\ndevours immense quantities, and the larva of the Golden-eyed,\r\nLace-winged fly (Chrysopa, Fig. 256).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 249. Coccinella and Young.]\r\n\r\nThe last days of June are literally the heyday and jubilee of insect\r\nlife. The entomological world holds high carnival, though in this\r\ncountry they are, perhaps, more given to mass-meetings and caucuses. The\r\nearth, the air, and the water teem with insect life. The insects of\r\nmid-summer, now appear. Among the butterflies, the Wood Satyrus\r\n(Neonympha Eurythris) skips in its low flight through the pines. The\r\nlarva of Grapta Progne appears on the currants, and feeds beneath the\r\nleaves on hot sunny days. The larva of Cynthia cardui may be found on\r\nthe hollyhocks; the pupa state lasts twelve days, the butterfly\r\nappearing in the middle or last of July. The Hyphantria textor now lays\r\nits smooth, spherical eggs in broad patches on the under side of the\r\nleaves of the apple, which the caterpillar will ravage in August; and\r\nits ally, the Halesidota cary\xc3\xa6, we have found ovipositing the last week\r\nin the month on the leaves of the butternut. The Squash bug, Coreus\r\n(Gonocerus) tristis (Fig. 250) is now very abundant, gathering about the\r\nroots of the squash vines, often in immense numbers, blackening the\r\nstems with their dark, blackish-brown bodies. This insect is easily\r\ndistinguished from the yellow striped Squash beetle previously\r\nmentioned, by its much greater size, and its entirely different\r\nstructure and habits. It is a true bug (Hemipter, of which the bed-bug\r\nis an example), piercing the leaves and stalks, and drawing out the sap\r\nwith its long sucker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 250. Squash Bug.]\r\n\r\nIn June, also, we have found that beautiful butterfly, Milit\xc3\xa6a Phaeton\r\nrising from the low, cold swamps. Its larva transforms early in June or\r\nthe last week in May, into a beautiful chrysalis. The larva hibernates\r\nthrough the winter, and may be found early in spring feeding on the\r\nleaves of the aster, the Viburnum dentatum and hazel. It is black and\r\ndeep orange-red, with long, thick-set, black spines.\r\n\r\nThe Currant borer, Trochilium tipuliforme (Fig. 251), a beautiful,\r\nslender, agile, deep blue moth, with transparent wings, flies the last\r\nof the month about currant bushes, and its chrysalids may be found in\r\nMay in the stems. Among moths, that of the American Tent caterpillar\r\nflies during the last of June and July, and its white cocoons can be\r\ndetected under bark, and in sheltered parts of fences and out-houses.\r\n\r\nAmong others of the interesting group of Silk worms (Bombycid\xc3\xa6) are\r\nLithosa, Crocota and allies, which fly in the daytime, and the different\r\nspecies of Arctia, and the white Arctians, Spilosoma, and Leucarctia,\r\nthe parent of the Salt-marsh Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 251. Currant Moth.]\r\n\r\nMany Leaf rollers, Tortrices, are rolling up leaves in various ways for\r\ntheir habitations, and to conceal them from too prying birds; and hosts\r\nof young Tineans are now mining leaves, and excavating the interior of\r\nseeds and various fruits. Grape-growers should guard against the attacks\r\nof a species of Tortrix (Penthina vitivorana) which rolls the leaves of\r\nthe grape, and, according to Mr. M. C. Reed, of Hudson, Ohio, "in\r\nmid-summer deposits its eggs in the grape; a single egg in a grape. Its\r\npresence is soon indicated by a reddish color on that side of the yet\r\ngreen grape, and on opening it, the winding channel opened by the larva\r\nin the pulp is seen, and the minute worm, which is white, with a dark\r\nhead, is found at the end of the channel. It continues to feed upon the\r\npulp of the fruit, and when it reaches the seeds, eats out their\r\ninterior; and if the supply from one grape is extinguished before its\r\ngrowth is completed, it fastens this to an adjoining grape with a web,\r\nand burrows into it. It finally grows to about one-half of an inch in\r\nlength, becomes brown, almost black, the head retaining its cinnamon\r\ncolor. When it leaves the grape it is very active, and has the power of\r\nletting itself down by a thread of silk. All my efforts to obtain the\r\ncocoons failed until I placed fresh grape leaves in the jar containing\r\nthe grapes. The larv\xc3\xa6 immediately betook themselves to these, and,\r\ncutting a curved line through the leaf thus), sometimes two lines thus\r\n(), folded the edge or edges over, and in the fold assumed the chrysalis\r\nform. From specimens saved, I shall hope to obtain the perfect insect\r\nthis season, and perhaps obtain information which will aid in checking\r\nits increase. Already it is so abundant that it is necessary to examine\r\nevery branch of ripe grapes, and clip out the infested berries before\r\nsending them to the table. A rapid increase in its numbers would\r\ninterfere seriously with the cultivation of the grape in this locality."\r\n\r\nThe Rose beetle (Macrodactyla subspinosa) appears in great abundance.\r\nThe various species of Buprestis are abundant; among them are the\r\nPeach-borer (Dicerca divaricata), which may be now found flying about\r\npeach and cherry trees; and Chrysobothris fulvogutta, and C. Harrisii,\r\nabout white pines. A large weevil (Arrhenodes septentrionalis), which\r\nlives under the bark of the white oak, appears in June and July. The\r\nChinch bug begins its terrible ravages in the wheat fields. The various\r\nspecies of Chrysopa or Lace-winged flies, appear during this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Insects of July._\r\n\r\nDuring mid-summer the bees and wasps are very busy building their nests\r\nand rearing their young. The Humble bees, late in June and the first of\r\nthis month, send out their first broods of workers, and about the middle\r\nof the month the second lot of eggs are laid, which produce the\r\nsmaller-sized females and males, while eggs laid late in the month and\r\nearly in August, produce the larger-sized queens, which soon hatch.\r\nThese hibernate. The habits of their peculiar parasite, Apathus, an\r\ninsect which closely resembles the Humble bee, are still unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 252. White-faced Wasp.]\r\n\r\nThe Leaf-cutter bee (Megachile) may be seen flying about with pieces of\r\nrose-leaf, with which she builds, for a period of twenty days, her\r\ncells, often thirty in number, using for this purpose, according to Mr.\r\nF. W. Putnam\'s estimate,[32] at least one thousand pieces! The bees\r\nreferred to "worked so diligently that they ruined five or six\r\nrose-bushes, not leaving a single unblighted leaf uncut, and were then\r\nforced to take the leaves of a locust tree as a substitute."\r\n\r\nThe Paper-making wasps, of which Vespa maculata (Fig. 252), the\r\n"White-faced wasp," is our largest species, are now completing their\r\nnests, and feeding their young with flies. The Solitary wasp (Odynerus\r\nalbophaleratus) fills its earthen cells with minute caterpillars, which\r\nit paralyzes with its poisonous sting. A group of mud-cells, each stored\r\nwith food for the single larva within, we once found concealed in a\r\ndeserted nest of the American Tent caterpillar. Numerous species of Wood\r\nwasps (Crabronid\xc3\xa6) are engaged in tunnelling the stems of the\r\nblackberry, the elder, and syringa, and enlarging and refitting old nail\r\nholes, and burrowing in rotten wood, storing their cells with flies,\r\ncaterpillars, aphides and spiders, according to the habit of each\r\nspecies. Eumenes fraterna, which attaches its single, large, thin-walled\r\ncell of mud to the stems of plants, is, according to Dr. T. W. Harris,\r\nknown to store it with Canker worms. Pelop\xc3\xa6us, the Mud-dauber, is now\r\nbuilding its earthen cells, plastering them on old rafters and stone\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nThe Saw flies (Tenthredo), etc., abound in our gardens this month. The\r\nSelandria vitis attacks the vine, while Selandria ros\xc3\xa6, the Rose slug,\r\ninjures the rose. The disgusting Pear slug-worm (S. cerasi), often live\r\ntwenty to thirty on a leaf, eating the parenchyma, or softer tissues,\r\nleaving the blighted leaf. The leaves should be sprinkled with a mixture\r\nof whale-oil soap and water, in the proportion of two pounds of soap to\r\nfifteen gallons of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 253. Imported Cabbage Butterfly.]\r\n\r\nAmong the butterflies, Melit\xc3\xa6a Ismeria, in the south, and M. Harrisii,\r\nin the north, are sometimes seen. A second brood of Colias Philodice,\r\nthe common sulphur-yellow butterfly, appears, and Pieris oleracea visits\r\nturnip-patches. It lays its eggs in June on the leaves, and the\r\nfull-grown, dark-green, hairy larva may be found in August. The Pieria\r\nrap\xc3\xa6, or imported cabbage butterfly (Fig. 253, male) is now also\r\nabundant. Its green hairy larva is fearfully prevalent about Boston and\r\nNew York. The last of the month a new brood of Grapta comma appears, and\r\na second brood of the larva of Chrysophanus Americanus may be found on\r\nthe sorrel.\r\n\r\nThe larv\xc3\xa6 of Pyrrarctia Isabella hatch out the first week in July, and\r\nthe snuff-colored moth enters our windows at night, in company with a\r\nhost of night-flying moths. These large moths, many of which are\r\ninjurious to crops, are commonly thought to feed on clothes and carpets.\r\nThe true carpet and clothes moths are minute species, which flutter\r\nnoiselessly about our apartments. Their narrow, feathery wings are edged\r\nwith long silken fringes, and almost the slightest touch kills them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 254. Apple Borer, Larva and Pupa.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 255. Lady Bug and Pupa.]\r\n\r\nAmong beetles, the various borers, such as the Saperda, or apple tree\r\nborer (Fig. 254) are now pairing, and fly in the hot sun about trees.\r\nNearly each tree has its peculiar enemy, which drives its galleries into\r\nthe trunk and branches of the tree. Among the Tiger beetles, frequenting\r\nsandy places, the large Cicindela generosa and the Cicindela hirticollis\r\nare most common. The grotesque larv\xc3\xa6 live in deep holes in sand-banks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 256. Lace-winged Fly and Eggs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 257. Forceps-tail.]\r\n\r\nThe nine-spotted Lady Bug, Coccinella novemnotata (Fig. 255, with pupa)\r\nis one of a large group of beetles, most beneficial from their habit of\r\nfeeding on the plant lice. We figure another enemy of the Aphides,\r\nChrysopa, and its eggs (Fig. 256), mounted each on a long silken stalk,\r\nthus placed above the reach of harm.\r\n\r\nAmong other beneficial insects belonging to the Neuroptera, is the\r\nimmense family of Libellulid\xc3\xa6, or Dragon flies. The Forceps-tail, or\r\nPanorpa, P. rufescens (Fig. 257), is found in bushy fields and\r\nshrubbery. They prey on smaller insects, and the males are armed at the\r\nextremity of the body with an enormous forceps-like apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Insects of August._\r\n\r\nDuring this month great multitudes of bugs (Hemiptera) are found in our\r\nfields and gardens; and to this group of insects the present chapter\r\nwill be devoted. They are nearly all injurious to crops, as they live on\r\nthe sap of plants, stinging them with their long suckers. Their\r\ncontinued attacks cause the leaves to wither and blight.\r\n\r\nThe grain Aphis, in certain years, desolates our wheat fields. We have\r\nseen the heads black with these terrible pests. They pierce the grain,\r\nextract the sap, causing it to shrink and lose the greater part of its\r\nbulk. It is a most insidious and difficult foe to overcome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 258. Leaf-hopper of the Vine.]\r\n\r\nThe various leaf-hoppers, Tettigonia (Fig. 258) and Ceresa, abound on\r\nthe leaves of plants, sadly blighting them; and the Tettigonias frequent\r\ndamp, wet, swampy places. A very abundant species on grass produces what\r\nis called "frog\'s spittle." It can easily be traced through all its\r\nchanges by frequently examining the mass of froth which surrounds it.\r\nTettigonia Vitis blights the leaf of the grape-vine. It is a tenth of an\r\ninch long, and is straw-yellow, striped with red. Tettigonia ros\xc3\xa6, a\r\nstill smaller species, infests the rose, often to an alarming extent.\r\n\r\nThe Notonecta, or water boatman, is much like a Tettigonia, but its\r\nwings are transparent on the outer half, and its legs are fringed with\r\nlong hairs, being formed for swimming. It rows over the surface in\r\npursuit of insects. Notonecta undulata Say (Fig. 259) is a common form\r\nin New England.\r\n\r\nAnother insect hunter is the singular Ranatra fusca (Fig. 260). It is\r\nlight brown in color, with a long respiratory tube which it raises above\r\nthe surface of the water when it wishes to breathe. This species\r\nconnects the Water-boatman with the Water-skaters, or Gerris, a familiar\r\ninsect, of which Gerris paludum (Fig. 261) is commonly seen running over\r\nthe surface of streams and pools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 259. Notonecta.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 260. Ranatra.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 261. Water Skater.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 262. Pirates.]\r\n\r\nReduvius and its allies belong to a large family of very useful insects,\r\nas they prey largely on caterpillars and noxious insects. Such is\r\nPirates picipes (Fig. 262), a common species. It is an ally of Reduvius\r\npersonates, a valued friend to man, as in Europe it destroys the\r\nbed-bug. Its specific name is derived from its habit while immature, of\r\nconcealing itself in a case of dust, the better to approach its prey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 263. Phymata.]\r\n\r\nAnother friend of the agriculturist is the Phymata erosa (Fig. 263). Mr.\r\nF. G. Sanborn states that "these insects have been taken in great\r\nnumbers upon the linden trees in the city of Boston, and were seen in\r\nthe act of devouring the Aphides, which have infested the shade trees of\r\nthat city for several years past. They are described by a gentleman who\r\nwatched their operations with great interest, as \'stealing up to a\r\nlouse, coolly seizing and tucking it under the arm, then inserting the\r\nbeak and sucking it dry.\' They are supposed to feed also on other\r\nvegetable-eating insects as well as the plant louse."\r\n\r\nPhytocoris lineolaris swarms in our gardens during this month. It is\r\ndescribed and figured in "Harris\'s Treatise on Insects." Closely allied,\r\nthough generally wingless, is that enemy of our peace, the bed-bug. It\r\nhas a small somewhat triangular head, orbicular thorax, and large,\r\nround, flattened abdomen. It is generally wingless, having only two\r\nsmall wing-pads instead. The eggs are oval, white; the young escape by\r\npushing off a lid at one end of the shell. They are white, transparent,\r\ndiffering from the perfect insect in having a broad, triangular head,\r\nand short, thick antenn\xc3\xa6. Indeed, this is the general form of lice\r\n(Pediculus Vestimenti, and P. capitis), to which the larva of Cimex has\r\nthe closest affinity. Some Cimices are parasites, infesting pigeons,\r\nswallows, etc., in this way also showing their near relation to lice.\r\nBesides the Reduvius, the cockroach is the natural enemy of the bed-bug,\r\nand destroys large numbers. Houses have been cleared of bugs after being\r\nthoroughly fumigated with brimstone.\r\n\r\nDuring this month the ravages of grasshoppers are, in the West, very\r\nwide-spread. We have received from Major F. Hawn, of Leavenworth,\r\nKansas, a most interesting account of the Red-legged locust (Caloptenus\r\nfemur-rubrum). "They commence depositing their eggs in the latter part\r\nof August. They are fusiform, slightly gibbous, and of a buff-color.\r\nThey are placed about three-fourths of an inch beneath the surface, in a\r\ncompact mass around a vertical axis, pointing obliquely up and outwards,\r\nand are partially cemented together, the whole presenting a cylindrical\r\nstructure, not unlike a small cartridge. They commence hatching in\r\nMarch, but it requires a range of temperature above 60\xc2\xba F. to bring them\r\nto maturity, and under such conditions they become fledged in\r\nthirty-three days, and in from three to five days after they enter upon\r\ntheir migratory flight.\r\n\r\n"Their instincts are very strong. When food becomes scarce at one point,\r\na portion of them migrate to new localities, and this movement takes\r\nplace simultaneously over large areas. In their progress they stop at no\r\nobstacle they can surmount. In these excursions they often meet with\r\nother trains from an opposite direction, when both join in one.\r\n\r\n"The insects are voracious, but discriminating in their choice of food,\r\nyet I know of no plant they reject if pressed by hunger; not even the\r\nfoliage of shrubs and trees, including pine and cedar."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 264. Seventeen Year Locust, Eggs and Pupa.]\r\n\r\nDuring this month the Seventeen-year locust (Cicada septendecim of\r\nLinn\xc3\xa6us, Fig. 264) has disappeared, and only a few Harvest flies, as the\r\ntwo other species we have are called, raise their shrill cry during the\r\ndog-days. But as certain years are marked by the appearance of vast\r\nswarms in the Middle States, we cannot do better than to give a brief\r\nsummary of its history, which we condense in part from Dr. Harris\' work.\r\n\r\nThe Seventeen-year locust ranges from South-eastern and Western\r\nMassachusetts to Louisiana. Of its distribution west of the Mississippi\r\nValley, we have no accurate knowledge. In Southern Massachusetts, they\r\nappear in oak forests about the middle of June. After pairing, the\r\nfemale, by means of her powerful ovipositor, bores a hole obliquely to\r\nthe pith, and lays therein from ten to twenty slender white eggs, which\r\nare arranged in pairs, somewhat like the grains on an ear of wheat, and\r\nimplanted in the limb. She thus oviposits several times in a twig, and\r\npasses from one to another, until she has laid four or five hundred\r\neggs. After this she soon dies. The eggs hatch in about two weeks,\r\nthough some observers state that they do not hatch for from forty to\r\nover fifty days after being laid. The active grubs are provided with\r\nthree pairs of legs. After leaving the egg they fall to the ground,\r\nburrow into it, and seek the roots of plants whose juices they suck by\r\nmeans of their long beaks. They sometimes attack the roots of fruit\r\ntrees, such as the pear and apple. They live nearly seventeen years in\r\nthe larva state, and then in the spring change to the pupa, which\r\nchiefly differs from the larva by having rudimentary wings. The damage\r\ndone by the larv\xc3\xa6 and pup\xc3\xa6, then, consists in their sucking the sap from\r\nthe roots of forest, and occasionally fruit trees.\r\n\r\nRegarding its appearance, Mr. L. B. Case writes us (June 15) from\r\nRichmond, Indiana: "Just now we are having a tremendous quantity of\r\nlocusts in our forests and adjoining fields, and people are greatly\r\nalarmed about them; some say they are Egyptian locusts, etc. This\r\nmorning they made a noise, in the woods about half a mile east of us,\r\nvery much like the continuous sound of frogs in the early spring, or\r\njust before a storm at evening. It lasted from early in the morning\r\nuntil evening." Mr. V. T. Chambers writes us that it is abounding in the\r\nvicinity of Covington, Kentucky, "in common with a large portion of the\r\nWestern country." He points out some variations in color from those\r\ndescribed by Dr. Fitch, from New York, and states that those occurring\r\nin Kentucky are smaller than those of which the measurements are given\r\nby Dr. Fitch, and states that "these differences indicate that the\r\ngroups, appearing in different parts of the country at intervals of\r\nseventeen years, are of different varieties." A careful comparison of\r\nlarge numbers collected from different broods, in different localities,\r\nand different years, would alone give the facts to decide this\r\ninteresting point. Mr. Riley has shown that in the Southern States a\r\nvariety appears every thirteen years.\r\n\r\nRegarding the question raised by Mr. Chambers, whether the sting of this\r\ninsect is poisonous, and which he is inclined to believe to be in part\r\ntrue, we might say that naturalists generally believe it to be harmless.\r\nNo hemiptera are known to be poisonous, that is, to have a poison-gland\r\nconnected with the sting, like that of the bee, and careful dissections\r\nby the eminent French naturalist, Lacaze-Duthiers, of three European\r\nspecies of Cicada, have not revealed any poison apparatus at the base of\r\nthe sting. Another proof that it does not pour poison into the wound\r\nmade by the ovipositor is, that the twig thus pierced and wounded does\r\nnot swell, as in the case of plants wounded by Gall flies, which,\r\nperhaps, secrete an irritating poison, giving rise to tumors of various\r\nshapes. Many insects sting without poisoning the wound; the bite of the\r\nmosquito, black fly, flea, the bed bug, and other hemipterous insects,\r\nare simply punctured wounds, the saliva introduced being slightly\r\nirritant, and to a perfectly healthy constitution they are not\r\npoisonous, though they may grievously afflict some persons, causing the\r\nadjacent parts to swell, and in some weak constitutions induce severe\r\nsickness. Regarding this point, Mr. Chambers writes: "I have heard--not\r\nthrough the papers--within a few days past of a child, within some\r\ntwenty miles of this place, dying from the sting of a Cicada, but have\r\nnot had an opportunity to inquire into the truth of the story, but the\r\nfollowing you may rely on. A negro woman in the employment of A. V.\r\nWinston, Esq., at Burlington, Boone County, Ky., fifteen miles distant\r\nfrom here, went barefooted into his garden a few days since, and while\r\nthere was stung or bitten in the foot by a Cicada. The foot immediately\r\nswelled to huge proportions, but by various applications the\r\ninflammation was allayed, and the woman recovered. Mr. Winston, who\r\nrelates this, stands as high for intelligence and veracity as any one in\r\nthis vicinity. I thought, on first hearing the story, that probably the\r\nsting was by some other insect, but Mr. Winston says that he saw the\r\nCicada. But perhaps this proves that the sting is _not_ fatal; that\r\ndepends on the subject. Some persons suffer terribly from the bite of a\r\nmosquito, while others scarcely feel them. The cuticle of a negro\'s foot\r\nis nearly impenetrable, and perhaps the sting would have been more\r\ndangerous in a more tender part." It is not improbable that the sting\r\nwas made by a wasp (Stizus) which preys on the Cicada. Dr. Le Baron and\r\nMr Riley believe the wound to be made by the beak, which is the more\r\nprobable solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nA word more about the Seventeen-year Cicada. Professor Orton writes us\r\nfrom Yellow Springs, Ohio, that this insect has done great damage to the\r\napple, peach, and quince trees, and is shortening the fruit crop very\r\nmaterially. By boring into twigs bearing fruit, the branches break and\r\nthe fruit goes with them. "Many orchards have lost full two years\'\r\ngrowth. Though the plum and cherry trees seemed exempt, they attacked\r\nthe grape, blackberry, raspberry, elm (white and slippery), maple, white\r\nash, willow, catalpa, honey-locust and wild rose. We have traces of the\r\nCicada this year from Columbus, Ohio, to St. Louis. Washington and\r\nPhiladelphia have also had a visitation."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 265. Hop Vine Moth and Young.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 266. Humble Bee Parasite.]\r\n\r\nWe figure the Hop-vine moth and the larva (Fig. 265) which abound on\r\nhops the last of summer. Also, the Ilythia colonella (Fig. 266, a,\r\npupa), known in England to be a parasite of the Humble bee. We have\r\nfrequently met with it here, though not in Humble bees\' nests. The larv\xc3\xa6\r\nfeed directly upon the young bees, according to Curtis (Farm Insects).\r\nThe Spindle-worm moth (Gortyna ze\xc3\xa6), whose caterpillar lives in the\r\nstalks of Indian corn, and also in dahlias, flies this month. The\r\nwithering of the leaves when the corn is young, shows the presence of\r\nthis pest. The beetles of various cylindrical Bark borers and Blight\r\nbeetles (Tomicus and Scolytus) appear again this month. During this\r\nmonth the Tree cricket (Oecanthus niveus, Fig. 267) lays its eggs in\r\nthe branches of peach trees. It will also eat tobacco leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 267. Tree Cricket.]\r\n\r\nWe figure (268) the moth of Ennomos subsignaria, the larva of which is\r\nso injurious to shade trees in New York City. It is a widely diffused\r\nspecies, occurring probably throughout the Northern States. We have\r\ntaken the moth in Northern Maine. We have received from Mr. W. V.\r\nAndrews the supposed larv\xc3\xa6 of this moth. They are "loopers," that is,\r\nthey walk with a looping gait, as if measuring off the ground they walk\r\nover, whence the name "Geometers," more usually applied to them. They\r\nare rather stout, brown, and roughened like a twig of the tree they\r\ninhabit, with an unusually large rust-red head, and red prop-legs, while\r\nthe tip of the body is also red. They are a little over an inch long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 268. Ennomos subsignaria.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Insects of September._\r\n\r\nFew new insects make their first appearance for the season during this\r\nmonth. Most of the species which abound in the early part of the month\r\nare the August forms, which live until they are killed by the frosts\r\nlate in the month. From this cause there is towards the end of the month\r\na very sensible diminution of the number of insects.\r\n\r\nThe early frosts warn these delicate creatures of approaching cold.\r\nHence the whole insect population is busied late in the month in looking\r\nout snug winter quarters, or providing for the continuance of the\r\nspecies. Warned by the cool and frosty nights, multitudes of\r\ncaterpillars prepare to spin their dense silken cocoons, which guard\r\nthem against frost and cold. Such are the "Spinners," as the Germans\r\ncall them, the Silk moths, of which the American Silk worm is a fair\r\nexample. The last of September it spins its dense cocoon, in which it\r\nhibernates in the chrysalis state.\r\n\r\nThe larv\xc3\xa6 of those moths, such as the Sphinges, or Hawk moths, which\r\nspin no cocoon, descend deep into the earth, where they transform into\r\nchrysalids and lie in deep earthen cocoons.\r\n\r\nThe wild bees may now be found frequenting flowers in considerable\r\nnumbers. Both sexes of the Humble bee, the Leaf-cutter bee, and other\r\nsmaller genera abound during the warm days.\r\n\r\nOne\'s attention during an unusually warm and pleasant day in this month\r\nis attracted by clouds of insects filling the air, especially towards\r\nsunset, when the slanting rays of the sun shine through the winged\r\nhosts. On careful investigation these insects will prove to be nearly\r\nall ants, and, perhaps, to belong to a single species. Looking about on\r\nthe ground, an unusual activity will be noticed in the ant-hills. This\r\nis the swarming of the ants. The autumnal brood of females has appeared,\r\nand this is their marriage day.\r\n\r\nThe history of a _formicarium_, or ant\'s nest, is as follows: The\r\nworkers, only, hibernate, and are found early in the spring, taking care\r\nof the eggs and larv\xc3\xa6 produced by the autumnal brood of females. In the\r\ncourse of the summer these eggs and larva\xc3\xa6 arrive at maturity, and swarm\r\non a hot sultry day, usually early in September. The females, after\r\ntheir marriage flight, for the small diminutive males seek their company\r\nat this time, descend and enter the ground to lay their eggs for new\r\ncolonies, or, as Westwood states, they are often seized by the workers\r\nand retained in the old colonies. Having no more inclination to fly,\r\nthey pluck off their wings and may be seen running about wingless.\r\n\r\nDr. C. C. Abbot gives us the following account of the swarming of a\r\nspecies in New Jersey: "On the afternoon of Oct. 6th, at about 4 P. M.,\r\nwe were attracted to a part of the large yard surrounding our home, by a\r\nmultitude of large sized insects that filled the air, and appeared to\r\nbe of some unusual form of insect life, judging of them from a distance.\r\nOn closer inspection these creatures proved to be a brood of red ants\r\n(Formica) that had just emerged from their underground home and were now\r\nfor the first time using their delicate wings. The sky, at the time, was\r\nwholly overcast; the wind strong, southeast; thermometer 66\xc2\xba Fahr.\r\nTaking a favorable position near the mass, as they slowly crawled from\r\nthe ground, up the blades of grass and stems of clover and small weeds,\r\nwe noted, first, that they seemed dazed, without any method in their\r\nmovements, save an ill-defined impression that they must go somewhere.\r\nAgain, they were pushed forward, usually by those coming after them,\r\nwhich seemed to add to their confusion. As a brood or colony of insects,\r\ntheir every movement indicated that they were wholly ill at ease.\r\n\r\n"Once at the end of a blade of grass, they seemed even more puzzled as\r\nto what to do. If not followed by a fellow ant, as was usually the case,\r\nthey would invariably fall down again to the earth, and sometimes repeat\r\nthis movement until a new comer joined in the ascent, when the\r\n_uncertain_ individual would be forced to use his wings. This flight\r\nwould be inaugurated by a very rapid buzzing of the wings, as though to\r\ndry them, or prove their owner\'s power over them, but which it is\r\ndifficult to say. After a short rest, the violent movement of the wings\r\nwould recommence, and finally losing fear, as it were, the ant would let\r\ngo his hold upon the blade of grass and rise slowly upwards. It could,\r\nin fact, scarcely be called flight. The steady vibration of the wings\r\nsimply bore them upwards, ten, twenty or thirty feet, until they were\r\ncaught by a breeze, or by the steadier wind that was moving at an\r\nelevation equal to the height of the surrounding pine and spruce trees.\r\nSo far as we were able to discover, their wings were of the same use to\r\nthem, in transporting them from their former home, that the \'wings\' of\r\nmany seeds are, in scattering them; both are wholly at the mercy of the\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bates, in describing the habits of the Sa\xc3\xbcba ants (Oecodoma\r\ncephalotes) says,[33] \'The successful _d\xc3\xa9but_ of the winged males and\r\nfemales depends likewise on the workers. It is amusing to see the\r\nactivity and excitement which reign in an ant\'s nest when the exodus of\r\nthe winged individuals is taking place. The workers clear the roads of\r\nexit, and show the most lively interest in their departure, although it\r\nis highly improbable that any of them will return to the same colony.\r\nThe swarming or exodus of the winged males and females of the Sa\xc3\xbcba ant\r\ntakes place in January and February, that is, at the commencement of the\r\nrainy season. They come out in the evening in vast numbers, causing\r\nquite a commotion in the streets and lanes.\' We have quoted this passage\r\nfrom Mr. Bates\' fascinating book, because of the great similarity and\r\ndissimilarity in the movements of the two species at this period of\r\ntheir existence. Remembering, at the time the above remarks concerning\r\nthe South American species, we looked carefully for the workers, in this\r\ninstance, and failed to discover above half a dozen wingless ants above\r\nground, and these were plodding about, very indifferent, as it appeared\r\nto us, to the fate or welfare of their winged brothers. And on digging\r\ndown a few inches, we could find but comparatively few individuals in\r\nthe nest, and could detect no movements on their parts that referred to\r\nthe exodus of winged individuals, then going on.\r\n\r\n"On the other hand, the time of day agrees with the remarks of Mr.\r\nBates. When we first noticed them, about 4 P. M., they had probably just\r\ncommenced their flight. It continued until nearly 7 P. M., or a\r\nconsiderable time after sundown. The next morning, there was not an\r\nindividual, winged or wingless, to be seen above ground; the nest itself\r\nwas comparatively empty; and what few occupants there were seemed to be\r\nin a semi-torpid condition. Were they simply resting after the fatigue\r\nand excitement of yesterday?\r\n\r\n"It was not possible for us to calculate what proportion of these winged\r\nants were carried by the wind too far to return to their old home; but\r\ncertainly a large proportion were caught by the surrounding trees; and\r\nwe found, on search, some of these crawling down the trunks of the\r\ntrees, with their wings in a damaged condition. How near the trees must\r\nbe for them to reach their old home, we should like to learn; and what\r\ntells them, \'which road to take?\' Dr. Duncan states,[34] \'It was\r\nformerly supposed that the females which alighted at a great distance\r\nfrom their old nests returned again, but Huber, having great doubts\r\nupon this subject, found that some of them, after having left the males,\r\nfell on to the ground in out-of-the-way places, whence they could not\r\npossibly return to the original nest!\' We unfortunately did not note the\r\nsex of those individuals that we intercepted in their return (?) trip;\r\nbut we can not help expressing our belief that, at least in this case,\r\nthere was scarcely an appreciable amount of \'returning\' on the part of\r\nthose whose exodus we have just described; although so many were caught\r\nby the nearer trees and shrubbery. Is it probable that these insects\r\ncould find their way to a small underground nest, where there was no\r\n\'travel\' in the vicinity, other than the steady departure of\r\nindividuals, who, like themselves, were terribly bothered with the wings\r\nthey were carrying about with them?" (_American Naturalist._)\r\n\r\nWe have noticed that those females that do not return to the old nest\r\nfound new ones. In Maine and Massachusetts we have for several\r\nsuccessive years noticed the swarming of certain species of ants during\r\nan unusually warm and sultry day early in September.\r\n\r\nThe autumnal brood of Plant lice now occur in great numbers on various\r\nplants. The last brood, however, does not consist exclusively of males\r\nand females, for of some of the wingless individuals previously supposed\r\nto be perfect insects of both sexes, Dr. W. I. Burnett found that many\r\nwere in reality of the ordinary gemmiparous form, such as those\r\ncomposing the early summer broods.\r\n\r\nThe White Pine Plant lice (Lachnus strobi) may be seen laying their long\r\nstring of black oval eggs on the needles of the pine. They are\r\naccompanied by hosts of two-winged flies, Ichneumons, and in the night\r\nby many moths which feed on the Aphis-honey they secrete, and which\r\ndrops upon the leaves beneath.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: The right side represents the under side of the wings.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: See "Proceedings of the Essex Institute," vol. iv,

I will say more: I hold that your work ought, in connection\r\nwith Harris\'s "Treatise on Insects Injurious to Vegetation," to which it\r\nis, as it were, the Key, to be introduced in all our Agricultural\r\nColleges, as the best text-book of that kind now extant.--_Extract from\r\nletter of Prof. L. Agassiz._\r\n\r\nI have received Part ten of your GUIDE TO THE STUDY OF INSECTS, which\r\nbrings the whole work so successfully to its completion. After all the\r\ngood things that have been said of it at home and abroad, any\r\ncommendation of mine would be quite superfluous. I will, however,\r\nexpress my obligation for both the pleasure and instruction I have\r\nreceived in reading it.--_Extract from letter of Prof. T. Wyman._\r\n\r\nThe first two parts are, we do not hesitate to affirm, the best things\r\nof the kind that our language possesses. We have seldom fallen on so\r\nthoroughly good a scientific treatise as the one whose features we have\r\nbriefly sketched, and we can only conclude our notice of it by advising\r\nall our natural history readers to make its acquaintance. There is no\r\nwork we should prefer to it as a book for the student, for it is a\r\ntreatise which displays an absolute avoidance of mere compilation, and\r\nit is pervaded by such a tone of earnestness, and contains so many\r\noriginal observations, that the reader is inducted by it out of the\r\nusual book-land of idealism into the substantial region of actuality and\r\nfact.--_Scientific Opinion_, London.\r\n\r\nToo often do we meet with a manual in which there is little more than a\r\ndescription of the external characters which nobody is satisfied with,\r\nbecause it is not full enough for the mere collector, and for the\r\ngeneral reader is too dry.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\r\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\r\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\ncollection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\r\n"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\r\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\r\nproperty infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\r\ncomputer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\r\nyour equipment.\r\n\r\n1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right\r\nof Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\r\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\r\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\r\nfees.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\r\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\r\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\r\nwith this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\r\npromotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\r\nharmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\r\nthat arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\r\nor cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nwork, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
