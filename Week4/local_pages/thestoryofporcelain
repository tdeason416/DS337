At last his dream had come\r\ntrue; he was in the heart of the Maine woods! It was a wonderful\r\nexperience for a boy of his age to be his father\'s companion on a\r\nfishing trip. Each spring when Dr. Swift had packed his tackle for his\r\nannual vacation into the wilderness, and Theo had looked on with\r\nhungry eyes as the rods, flies, and tramping boots had been stowed\r\naway in the canvas grips, his father had said:\r\n\r\n"Wait until you are a bit older, son, and you shall go with me."\r\n\r\nAnd now that day had come, and here he was! It seemed too good to be\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nHe glanced up to find his father smiling down at him.\r\n\r\n"Well?" questioned the older man. "What do you think of the camp? Does\r\nit come up to your expectations?"\r\n\r\n"I should say it did!" Theo managed to gasp. "It is great, Father!"\r\n\r\n"Think you can be contented here for a month?"\r\n\r\n"Contented!" laughed Theo.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t be getting lonesome and wishing you were back in New York?"\r\n\r\n"Not much."\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope you\'ll have a good time. Certainly with plenty of\r\nfishing and tramping you should. You will find Manuel, our Indian\r\nguide, a never-ending source of entertainment; he can do everything\r\nfrom dressing a moose to building a canoe. There isn\'t a trail through\r\nthese woods that he couldn\'t travel blindfolded. You will be perfectly\r\nsafe with him; only you must do exactly as he says, no matter how\r\nsilly his orders may seem. He knows the woods better than you do--or\r\nthan I do, for that matter. Remember you are no longer on Fifth\r\nAvenue, where you can call a policeman or a taxicab if you get\r\nlost. This vast forest is an entirely different proposition."\r\n\r\nTheo nodded.\r\n\r\n"How still it is," he said softly.\r\n\r\n"Yes," rejoined his father; "that is why it means to me something that\r\nno other place can. After the rush of the city, the jangle of\r\ntelephones, the constant sight of sick people, there is nothing to\r\ncompare with the restfulness of these woods."\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, who had been standing with his back to the fire, his hands\r\nclasped behind him, drew out his pipe, lighted it, and puffed a ring\r\nof smoke into the air.\r\n\r\n"You have had a very busy year, Father."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I fancy there will be a still busier one ahead. Before I\r\nattack it I feel that it is my duty to get a good rest. In these war\r\ndays a doctor never knows where he may be needed to serve. Thus far my\r\nplace seems to have been at a home hospital. With eight of our\r\noperating staff in France it has meant much extra work, too. Not that\r\nI am complaining of that. I am only too glad to do my bit wherever it\r\nis. But I had got to the point where I felt that the man who can give\r\nthe best service is the man who does not allow himself to become too\r\nfagged. So I determined to take my usual vacation even though on the\r\nface of it it seemed a crime to devote myself to nothing but fishing\r\nfor a whole month."\r\n\r\nTheo glanced into the face of the big, earnest man before him; he felt\r\nsuddenly very grown up. His father had seldom talked to him like\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n"This war," went on Dr. Swift thoughtfully, "is going to make demands\r\non all of us--demands for money, work, and time. We should be proud to\r\ngive these, for it is the first time our country has ever asked\r\nanything of our generation. We have taken unthinkingly all the\r\nbenefits America has to offer--libraries; schools; well ordered cities\r\nto live in; the blessings of constant peace and prosperity. For it we\r\nhave returned to the government only the slight taxes demanded for the\r\nup-keep of these things; and most of us, I blush to say, have grumbled\r\na great deal about it, at that. As a nation we were becoming too\r\ncomfortable, too rich, too selfish, too complacent. Now a crisis has\r\narisen when the United States is asking more of us, as it has every\r\nright to do; and we should be eager to prove our gratitude for all we\r\nhave so freely received. Only those who have traveled much can fully\r\nrealize what a home and an education in a place like America mean.\r\nNever forget, son, that all we can do, even to the sacrifice of our\r\nlives, is none too high a price to pay for our beloved country."\r\n\r\n"I wish I might have gone to France, Father," said Theo earnestly.\r\n\r\n"A boy of fifteen is too young to go," returned Dr. Swift. "If you\r\nwere older I should be the first to bid you Godspeed, for it is a\r\ngreat opportunity for service. Those who are not sharing it are\r\nmissing one of life\'s richest experiences. It means danger, privation,\r\nperhaps death; but it means also the exercise of all that is finest in\r\nour natures--patriotism, heroism, the dedication of ourselves to a\r\ngreat cause. I should have been proud to have you in France,\r\nTheo. However, there is much a boy can do here and now. He can begin\r\nbeing a loyal unselfish citizen, and training himself to bear his part\r\nwhen he shall be older. Get your education first. Prepare yourself to\r\nbe of value to humanity so that when your time to help comes it may\r\nfind you useful and ready."\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence.\r\n\r\nThe great logs in the rough stone chimney crackled and snapped, and up\r\nthe flue roared the blaze. Outside all was still save when the breeze\r\nstirred the giant pines causing them to give out a mighty whisper like\r\nthe murmur of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt was a cozy interior over which the firelight flashed.\r\n\r\nThe log cabin had been sheathed to keep it warm and tight, and to\r\nconceal its barrenness on the walls had been tacked a few gaily\r\ncolored prints. On one side of the room were several well-filled\r\nbookshelves, while on the opposite wall were racks for pipes and\r\nguns. From over the fireplace an elk\'s head peered forth, catching the\r\nscarlet glow from the fire on its mammoth antlers. Two small bedrooms\r\nwhich led out of this living-room completed the cabin. Outside stood\r\nfour others built exactly like this one, and in addition a\r\ndining-cabin, cook-house, and two cabins for the guides.\r\n\r\nAside from this tiny settlement on the lake\'s edge there was not a\r\nhouse for twenty miles. It was a wilderness indeed!\r\n\r\n"Are there any other people staying here at the camp beside\r\nourselves?" inquired Theo at last.\r\n\r\nDr. Swift, who had seated himself before the fire, nodded.\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is a Mr. Croyden, from Trenton, New Jersey, whom I have\r\nmet here before--a splendid man, whom you will like. He is a great\r\nfisherman--comes back every season just about this time. At present\r\nthere is no one else, so you will not find the woods overcrowded."\r\n\r\nTheo laughed at the bare suggestion, then yawned drowsily.\r\n\r\n"Nor will you be troubled by not sleeping to-night, eh, son? You look\r\nabout ready to hit the pillow this minute."\r\n\r\n"I am," replied Theo. "I never was so sleepy in my life."\r\n\r\n"That is the Maine air."\r\n\r\n"Some of it is the effect of the corduroy road," the boy observed with\r\na grin.\r\n\r\n"It is a beastly road, that carry," agreed Dr. Swift. "It shakes\r\nevery bone in your body. When you do manage to get here, however, it\r\ncertainly is worth the trip. Do you feel as if you could worry down a\r\nlittle dinner?"\r\n\r\n"Well, rather!"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor chuckled.\r\n\r\n"So do I. It ought to be ready soon now, for it is nearly six."\r\n\r\nJust at this moment the sound of a horn was heard.\r\n\r\nDr. Swift rose promptly.\r\n\r\n"That is dinner," he said.\r\n\r\n"I expected a bell," Theo answered, springing up.\r\n\r\n"Waiting for a Japanese gong, are you? Well, you won\'t hear it here."\r\n\r\nClapping a hand affectionately on his son\'s shoulder the elder man led\r\nthe way to the dining-cabin and pushed open the door.\r\n\r\nUpon the hearth inside another bright fire glowed, and before it stood\r\na long roughly made table covered with immaculate enamel cloth, on\r\nwhich was spread a smoking meal.\r\n\r\nA man with a pair of merry brown eyes rose from his chair as the two\r\ntravelers entered.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to see you, Dr. Swift," he exclaimed heartily, putting out\r\nhis hand. "So you are back to the fishing grounds once more!"\r\n\r\n"I certainly am, Mr. Croyden, and thankful enough to be here. I\'ve\r\nbrought my boy, Theodore, with me this time; Theo, we call him."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden took the lad\'s hand cordially.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to see you, youngster," he said. "If you prove half as good\r\na fisherman as your father the two of you won\'t leave a trout or\r\nsalmon in these waters."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m not a fisherman at all," Theo confessed. "I never cast a fly\r\nin my life."\r\n\r\n"You certainly have come to the right place to learn, then. Your\r\nfather has been neglecting your education, I fear. I see there is\r\nsomething we can teach you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid there are a good many things," replied Theo modestly.\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden regarded him approvingly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, boy," he said kindly. "Never be afraid to learn. We all\r\nare still learning, at least I am; and I will wager your father is,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"A doctor is always learning," assented Theo\'s father.\r\n\r\n"And a business man as well," put in Mr. Croyden. "When we no longer\r\nneed to learn we can be pretty sure we are near the end of our\r\nusefulness in this world. Now suppose we begin your education, Theo,\r\nby teaching you the proper way to eat a brook trout. How would that\r\nlesson please you?"\r\n\r\nThere was a twinkle in the stranger\'s eye.\r\n\r\n"Very much indeed."\r\n\r\n"I rather thought so," was the laughing answer. "Here, Franz, help\r\nDr. Swift and his son to some of the fish I caught to-day. They are\r\nthe first of the season, Doctor, with my compliments." He made a\r\ncourtly gesture with his hand. "Remember, Theo," he added, "always to\r\nopen a fish up the back. In that way you can take the backbone out\r\nwhole and save yourself a deal of trouble."\r\n\r\nTheo nodded his thanks for the suggestion.\r\n\r\nWhat a dinner it was!\r\n\r\nThe trout were fried to a rich bronze, and the crisp potatoes were\r\ndiscs of golden brown; in addition there were baked beans, smoking\r\nbrown-bread, slices of creamy cheese, and a pyramid of doughnuts. At\r\nthe conclusion of the meal Franz came running from the cook-house with\r\na covered dish heaped high with pancakes.\r\n\r\nIt was only when the three campers were unable to crowd down another\r\nmouthful that they rose from the table.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you and Theo want to come into my cabin and enjoy my fire for a\r\nwhile?" asked Mr. Croyden.\r\n\r\n"Why, thank you, Croyden," answered Dr. Swift; "we might make you a\r\nshort call. We are off to bed early, however, so we must not stay\r\nlong."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden\'s cabin proved to be a replica of the Swifts\' own cozy\r\none, except that it was more sumptuously furnished; for Mr. Croyden,\r\nwho was a hunter as well as a fisherman, had adorned both couch and\r\nfloors with great bearskins, trophies of his luck.\r\n\r\nAs his guests entered he hurried forward to put another four-foot log\r\non the fire, after which he dragged out three steamer-chairs and\r\nplaced them before the blaze.\r\n\r\n"All the comforts of home, you see," he said gaily.\r\n\r\n"More comforts than some of us get at home," smiled Dr. Swift. "There\r\nis nothing to equal this in New York."\r\n\r\nFor a moment none of them spoke; they were watching the scarlet rise\r\nand fall of the flame.\r\n\r\n"What a lot of company a fire is!" mused Dr. Swift.\r\n\r\n"I know it," came from Mr. Croyden. "And did you ever think how easily\r\nwe can produce it? Within the space of a second we can start a blaze.\r\nA fire was quite another problem for our forefathers who lived long\r\nbefore matches were invented. Think back to the time when people\r\nrubbed dried sticks together to make a spark; or later when they were\r\nforced to use flint and matchlock. It meant no end of work to\r\ncapture that first light, and even then it frequently went out. How\r\nhousewives struggled to keep the embers on the hearth always glowing\r\nthat a new fire might be built without so much trouble; and how men\r\ncarried from place to place coals enough to kindle other fires! When\r\nwe strike a match and so quickly get our response of flame we do not\r\nhalf appreciate how fortunate we are."\r\n\r\n"I never thought what it would mean to have no matches," reflected\r\nTheo.\r\n\r\n"Man\'s discovery of the use of fire was one of the first steps in his\r\ncivilization," Dr. Swift put in. "It meant that henceforth instead of\r\neating raw food as did the other animals he could have it cooked. For\r\nman, you must remember, is the only animal who cooks his food."\r\n\r\n"And hand in hand with the cooking came the need of dishes in which to\r\nprepare it," rejoined Mr. Croyden. "Meats could, of course, be broiled\r\nover the fire on a forked stick; but no stews or soups could be had\r\nuntil man invented some utensil which would contain liquid and at the\r\nsame time withstand the heat of the blaze. That problem was the one\r\nthat confronted all primitive races, and set them to fashioning\r\npottery. The history of their first attempts is most interesting.\r\nProbably chance led people to the discovery that they could mix clay\r\nwith water, and that it would harden in the sun. They may have seen a\r\nprint of their own feet immortalized in the sun-baked mud, and caught\r\nat the idea of taking the clay for more useful purposes. Nobody knows\r\nwhere they got their first inspiration. But every race that has\r\nexisted has had its crude receptacles for food and water."\r\n\r\nTheo was not sleepy now; he was far too interested to think of sleep.\r\n\r\n"Even in the Stone Age, when men lived in caves and great creatures\r\nnow extinct roamed the earth, men made bowls, pots, and vases, some of\r\nwhich are in existence in our museums of to-day," continued\r\nMr. Croyden. "We have, too, a few specimens of clumsy vessels made\r\nfrom grayish black clay which are relics of the Lake Dwellers, who\r\nfashioned their houses on piles, and set them in the middle of small\r\nlakes as a protection against wild animals and rival races of\r\nsavages. Then followed what is known as the Bronze Age, and we find\r\nthat the people of this era also worked with clay. Their designs\r\nshowed a decided advance, too, even some simple decoration being\r\nattempted."\r\n\r\n"All that was in Europe, I suppose," Theo ventured shyly.\r\n\r\n"By no means," replied Mr. Croyden. "On the contrary, we have found in\r\nour own hemisphere specimens of this prehistoric pottery. In some\r\ncases baskets of twigs were woven and lined with clay, after which\r\nthey were baked in the fire and the twigs burned off. Other pieces\r\nwere built up from coils of clay wound round and round, and when\r\npartly hardened these were worked together with a tool in order that\r\nthe cracks might be filled. All through the western part of our\r\ncountry have been found clay relics of various early tribes of\r\nIndians; and in some places are giant mounds in which have been buried\r\nall sorts of crude clay jugs and bowls. Since these primal peoples\r\nused for materials the natural clays and earths they succeeded in\r\nproducing some excellent colors, too."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden paused.\r\n\r\n"Was the potter\'s wheel in use then?" questioned Dr. Swift.\r\n\r\n"Probably not. There is no trace of it in this early work. It is not\r\nuntil the historic age that we have the potter\'s wheel, the oldest and\r\nfirst mechanical device mentioned in history. Mexicans, Peruvians,\r\nEgyptians, Greeks, Assyrians, Romans, Gauls, Teutons all used it."\r\n\r\n"I have seen some of the old Mexican or Aztec pottery," declared\r\nDr. Swift, "and it was very interesting. It was of reddish clay, and\r\nI was told it was much like the variety made in Peru. Not only were\r\nthere roughly modeled dishes and jars in the collection, but also all\r\nsorts of strange clay idols. You see, instead of worshipping the gods\r\nof goodness, Theo, these early peoples thought they could propitiate\r\nthe gods of evil if they worshipped them instead; accordingly they\r\nmade all sorts of grotesque images, some of them very hideous. None of\r\nthis clay work was glazed, of course, for at that time men had not yet\r\ndiscovered that they could put a glaze over the surface of objects and\r\nthus protect them and render them water-tight. It was a great pity\r\nthat Cortez and his followers destroyed this early Mexican\r\ncivilization, which was surprisingly advanced.\r\n\r\n"I suppose the Peruvians had also gone quite as far if not further\r\nthan the Aztecs when in 1531 Pizarro invaded South America," rejoined\r\nMr. Croyden. "They were making some very good pottery decorated in\r\nred, black, and brown; and they must have known how to bake it, or the\r\ncolors in the design would not have lasted until now."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden rose to stamp out a spark that had snapped from the\r\nfireplace onto the fur rug at his feet.\r\n\r\n"Strange, isn\'t it, how much of our knowledge of the ancient races has\r\ncome down to us through their clay work?" he reflected. "What should\r\nwe have known of these western civilizations save through their\r\nhandiwork? And when we travel across seas it is the same. Much of our\r\nacquaintance with Egyptian, Greek, and Roman life has been handed down\r\nto posterity through tiles and pottery which have served to record\r\nnations\' customs and advancement. The march of the invading Roman\r\narmies, for example, can be traced by the fragments of pottery left\r\nbehind them. These relics have been found in England, France,\r\nGermany, Italy, and Spain, and prove that very early the Romans made\r\nuse of clay utensils for cooking their food. Even beneath the city of\r\nLondon old Roman furnaces for firing dishes have been discovered; and\r\nmoreover, some of the very dishes themselves."\r\n\r\nTheo seemed astonished.\r\n\r\n"Later the Romans made much beautiful pottery; but it was never as\r\nbeautiful as that of the Greeks. Sometime, however, Theo, you should\r\ngo to one of our museums and see some Samian ware, the finest of Roman\r\nclay work. The red in it is almost as vivid as sealing-wax, and it has\r\na wonderful polish not unlike that on modern Egyptian ware. No one has\r\never been able to discover from what clay this marvelous pottery was\r\nmade. Some historians think the ware was first made by wandering\r\nGreek artisans. The Romans also made a very beautiful black ware now\r\nknown as Upchurch pottery because of the location in England in which\r\nit was found. This black color, scientists have decided, was not\r\nproduced by mixing a pigment with the clay as did the Greeks, but\r\nresulted from an ingenious use of oxide of iron which, when burned by\r\na reducing fire, turned black; the Romans also gave us Castor ware, a\r\npottery moulded from a dark clay and having on it figures traced in a\r\nlighter color."\r\n\r\n"Did anybody else in Europe make as beautiful pottery as the Greeks\r\nand Romans?" inquired Theo.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not so beautiful," answered Mr. Croyden. "Yet before we hear\r\neither of Greek or Roman we find the Egyptians and Assyrians, nations\r\nfamous for their skill in the arts as well as their prowess in war,\r\nmaking pottery and tiles. These have been preserved to us in tombs\r\nand pyramids, for these races, you know, were accustomed to pay great\r\nhonor to their dead. It was a fortunate custom, too, since by means of\r\nit much history has come down to us which would otherwise have been\r\ndestroyed. Unquestionably the Saxons, Scandinavians, Gauls, and\r\nTeutons also made pottery, but their attempts were of a cruder\r\nsort. Dishes, vases, toys have been exhumed in their countries, all\r\ndisplaying characteristic clay designs. But no country in the world\r\nhas ever equaled the pottery of the Greeks."\r\n\r\n"Did the Greeks----" began Theo; but his father cut him short.\r\n\r\n"See here, young man," he declared, drawing out his watch, "this is no\r\ntime of night for you to be setting forth on a history of Greek\r\npottery. You are going to bed."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT BED"]\r\n\r\nTheo rose with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"I had forgotten all about bed," he said.\r\n\r\n"That speaks pretty well for your charm as an historian, Croyden,"\r\nobserved Dr. Swift. "The boy could scarcely keep his eyes open at\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you tell me about Greek pottery some other time, sir?" asked\r\nTheo.\r\n\r\n"I\'d be glad to, sonny," Mr. Croyden returned. "I never dreamed a boy\r\nwould be interested in such a dull subject."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t dull when you tell it," came naively from Theo.\r\n\r\n"That is the biggest compliment I ever had in my life," exclaimed the\r\nfisherman with pleasure. "You shall hear more of Greek pottery\r\nto-morrow if by that time you still want to. Good-night. The most\r\nbeautiful thing I can wish you is that you dream of Greek vases all\r\nnight long."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMR. CROYDEN KEEPS HIS PROMISE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Theo awoke the next day the novelty of his surroundings drove\r\nevery thought of Greek pottery from his mind. As he peeped out of his\r\nwindow he could see slanting rifts of early sunlight flecking with\r\ngold the trunks of the great pines. From the chimney of the\r\ncookhouse a spiral of blue smoke was ascending and as it rose it\r\ncarried into the air with it a pleasant odor of burning wood and\r\nfrying bacon.\r\n\r\nTheo did not dally with his dressing, you may be sure; he was far too\r\nhungry, and too eager to attack the program for the day.\r\n\r\n"Put on thick boots, son," called Dr. Swift from his room. "The\r\nweather is fine. It is an ideal morning to tramp across Owl\'s Nest\r\nCarry and fish in the lake beyond there."\r\n\r\n"What time is it, Father?" inquired Theo. "I forgot to wind my watch\r\nlast night."\r\n\r\n"Six o\'clock. We shall have a three mile walk, and plenty of time to\r\nget in some fishing before the sun is high. Then we can paddle\r\nup-stream to the camp at the farther end of Owl Lake and cook our\r\nlunch. How does that plan please you?"\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" cried Theo. "Is there a camp like this over there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. Just a lean-to which serves as a shelter, if people want to\r\nspend the night and be on hand for early morning fishing. Sometimes,\r\ntoo, I have gone over in the late afternoon and fished until dark,\r\nafterward turning in on the pine boughs for the night. It is only a\r\ncrude little camp, but it is perfectly comfortable. You will like Owl\r\nLake. It is smaller than this one, but it has a very pretty shore\r\nbordered with a stretch of white sandy beach."\r\n\r\n"It must be a great place for swimming."\r\n\r\n"It is. Just now, however, the water is too cold. Later in the season\r\nwhen things get warmed up it is the finest bathing place\r\nimaginable. Are you ready for breakfast now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'d better run along. I will join you in a few moments. I must\r\ngo first and see Manuel about the lunch."\r\n\r\n"All right, sir."\r\n\r\nThrough the crisp morning air Theo bounded across to the dining-cabin,\r\nwhere he found Mr. Croyden.\r\n\r\nA bright fire burned on the hearth and the table with its heaping\r\nplates of hot johnny-cake looked most inviting.\r\n\r\n"Hello, youngster!" called the older man, glancing up with a\r\nsmile. "How do you find yourself to-day? All lamed up after your jolt\r\nover the carry?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit, Mr. Croyden," laughed Theo. "I\'m not lame at all. I\'m just\r\nhungry."\r\n\r\n"A perfectly normal condition. So long as you can eat I guess there is\r\nnot much the matter with you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can always eat," grinned Theo. "Mother says my appetite never\r\ngoes back on me."\r\n\r\n"Well, fall to. It looks as if Franz had prepared for the worst,"\r\nchuckled Mr. Croyden. "What are you and your dad up to to-day?"\r\n\r\n"We are going to Owl Lake to fish."\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t a bad beginning. It is not a long tramp, and the fish are\r\nbiting well over there. I have tried it several times and had\r\nexcellent luck. You are wise to start in gradually and not attempt\r\ntoo long a jaunt at first. There is everything in getting into\r\ntraining, as your father well knows."\r\n\r\nThere was a bang of the door, and Dr. Swift entered.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Doctor," said Mr. Croyden. "So you and your son are to\r\ntry your skill at Owl to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. That seemed to be a good starter."\r\n\r\n"An excellent one."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you come along with us?"\r\n\r\n"I?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; that is, unless you have other plans. We should be glad to have\r\nyou. The more the merrier."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would come, Mr. Croyden," urged Theo.\r\n\r\n"That is very kind of you," returned Mr. Croyden, hesitating a\r\nlittle. "I had not planned my day. Are you sure you want so many?"\r\n\r\n"Three is not many. Come along, by all means," declared\r\nDr. Swift. "Manuel says the lake has not yet been fished much and that\r\nthe trout are biting well. Get Tony, your guide, to pack up your\r\ntackle and bring some lunch. I am afraid we have not enough for all\r\nhands."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do that," he replied. "What time are you starting?"\r\n\r\n"Just as soon as I have succeeded in getting Theo to take a little\r\nnourishment," returned the Doctor.\r\n\r\nThis task Dr. Swift evidently did not find difficult, for within a\r\nhalf hour the party were setting forth through the woods.\r\n\r\nThe luncheon, tackle, and sweaters had been put into a canoe, which\r\nTony and Manuel raised to their shoulders as if it were a feather.\r\n\r\n"There is a punt over at Owl that we can use, so we shall need only\r\none canoe," explained Manuel as he strode along.\r\n\r\nThe carry was not a rough one, but to Theo, accustomed to the\r\nsmoothness of city pavements, it seemed very rough indeed. He was\r\ncontinually stepping into holes or climbing over fallen tree-trunks,\r\nand although a good walker, the pace the guides set made him\r\npant. Even Dr. Swift was forced to confess that he was out of breath\r\nand was obliged now and then to stop and rest. Mr. Croyden, on the\r\ncontrary, swung along the narrow trail with the ease of an Indian.\r\n\r\n"You will get into trim in a few days," he observed encouragingly to\r\nTheo. "I myself am always stiff and slow until I get limbered up."\r\n\r\nWhen, however, Owl Lake finally came into sight both Theo and his\r\nfather instantly forgot their fatigue.\r\n\r\nThere stretched the tiny sheet of water, a gem of flashing blue whose\r\ncalm surface mirrored the pines and delicate birches bordering its\r\nmargin.\r\n\r\nThe punt and canoe were launched, the tackle unpacked, and amid a\r\nsilence broken only by the dip of oar and paddle the fishermen drifted\r\nout into the stillness.\r\n\r\nAh, it was a day never to be forgotten! Certainly Theo would never\r\nforget it, for it was during the first half-hour of this Arabian\r\nNight\'s dream that he proudly landed a beautiful lake trout, the first\r\none he had ever caught.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment he felt the tug at his line until his catch was safely\r\nin the bottom of the boat his excitement was tremendous. How the\r\nlittle creature pulled! How it swept away with the bait into deep\r\nwater! With Manuel, Dr. Swift, Tony, and Mr. Croyden all coaching\r\nhim, and almost as frenzied as he, poor Theo hardly knew where he\r\nwas. But he obeyed the insistent command of: "_Play him! Play him!_"\r\nand play him he did. Even with the captive\'s final leap into the air\r\nthe trout did not succeed in freeing itself from the hook. Keeping his\r\nprize well away from the boat that the line might not slacken Theo at\r\nlast reeled in his victim.\r\n\r\nHe gasped when the feat was accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe second time he knew better what to do; and before the sun was high\r\nand the fish had ceased to bite he landed five beauties.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime both his father and Mr. Croyden had been so absorbed\r\nin watching his pleasure that they had almost forgotten their own\r\nlines, and it was not until a big land-loch struck that the Doctor\r\nremembered he, too, was fishing. When finally a lull in the sport\r\ncame and the party pulled up-stream toward the lean-to, there were a\r\ndozen good-sized trout in Mr. Croyden\'s basket and as many more in the\r\nDoctor\'s.\r\n\r\nThen came the disembarking at the upper end of the lake, and the\r\nbuilding of the fire. Dry wood was taken from the shelter of the\r\nhouse, and in the clearing before the camp, on a foundation of large\r\nflat stones, the fire was kindled. It was a marvel to Theo to see how\r\nquickly Manuel and Tony made things ready. They produced a small\r\nfrying-pan, greased it, and had the fish sizzling in it before you\r\ncould say Jack Robinson. Then they unpacked the hampers and brought\r\nforth tin plates, knives, and forks.\r\n\r\nHow good the meal tasted!\r\n\r\nThe great slices of bread-and-butter, with layers of creamy cheese\r\nbetween them, seemed a royal feast to the ravenous sportsmen; and the\r\nsteaming coffee and thin slices of crisp bacon food for the gods. As\r\nfor the trout--particularly the big one Theo himself had caught--well,\r\nthere never was such eating!\r\n\r\nAfter lunch was done the fishermen were loth to leave the sunny\r\nshelter of the cabin.\r\n\r\nDr. Swift and Mr. Croyden lounged on the door-sill, while Theo skipped\r\nstones in the water until his arm was tired. Then exhausted by his\r\nexertions he sank wearily down on a stump near the lean-to and\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n"Why wouldn\'t this be a good time, Mr. Croyden, to tell us some more\r\nabout Greek pottery?"\r\n\r\n"Greek pottery? Bless my heart! I thought you had forgotten all about\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"So I had when I was fishing," confessed Theo honestly. "But I have\r\nremembered it again now."\r\n\r\n"You are a frank youngster," laughed Mr. Croyden. "Well, let me\r\nsee. You know the making of pottery was a fine art among the\r\nGreeks. They made two kinds--neither of them glazed, of course,\r\nbecause at that time nobody knew how to glaze pottery. The first kind\r\nwas a pottery of red clay on which were placed decorations of black\r\npigment; the other was a pottery on which they painted figures in red,\r\nafterward filling in the background around them with black. These two\r\nvarieties of ware are briefly known as black on red, and red on\r\nblack. The black portion of this pottery possessed a wonderful polish\r\nwhich came from the black pigment mixed with the clay; the red part,\r\non the contrary, had no lustre, evidently being smoothed and polished\r\nwith some hard tool after the vase was finished. These vases were\r\nvery beautiful in form and design, no two of them being alike. Each\r\nwas made by an individual artist who pleased himself as to the\r\narrangement of the birds, animals, and gracefully draped figures\r\nwith which he decorated it. The famous Fran\xc3\xa7ois vase at Florence is a\r\nmarvelous example of this sixth century workmanship; every inch of its\r\nclosely adorned surface is covered with carefully drawn figures in\r\nblack, white, and purple. This particular piece was probably made by\r\ntwo Athenian artists, as it shows two distinct types of work. Think\r\nhow fortunate we are to have had it come down to us unbroken through\r\nthe tumult of the years!"\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden gazed thoughtfully into the fire.\r\n\r\n"You know that at the time these exquisite vases were made the entire\r\nGreek nation was devoting itself to the fashioning of beautiful\r\nthings. Sculptors were carving wonderful statues, toiling eagerly to\r\nmake each piece more perfect in form; architects were rearing such\r\nbuildings as the world has never since seen; and in the centre of\r\nAthens a district was reserved which was entirely occupied by the\r\nshops of potters and painters and known as the _ceramicus_. It is from\r\nthis ancient word that our present day term ceramics is\r\nderived. Within this area devoted to the making of pottery the artists\r\nworked, each one reverently bending his energy to give to the world a\r\nthing which should be as nearly perfect in form and decoration as he\r\ncould make it. Thousands of vases went out, many of them into the\r\nhomes of rich, beauty-loving Greeks; many into the temples; and many\r\ninto Athenian tombs; for the people of this nation always loyally\r\nhonored their dead. In addition to these vases there were smaller\r\narticles--perfume bottles, jars for wine or water, utensils used at\r\nceremonials in the temples; and the beautiful amphora, a vase given as\r\na prize at the great Greek festivals, and the progenitor of the silver\r\ncups we now give the winners in athletic games. This latter type of\r\nvase had two handles and frequently its base was tapered to a point in\r\norder that it might rest in a tripod, or be thrust into the earth. At\r\nthe Louvre in Paris there is a very famous Greek amphora which I hope\r\nyou will see some day."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see it," declared Theo eagerly.\r\n\r\n"I intend you shall, son," put in Dr. Swift. "I mean to give you the\r\nchance to see all the finest things in the world, if I have my way."\r\n\r\nTheo smiled gratefully into his father\'s face.\r\n\r\n"When we marvel at the grace and perfection of Greek decoration we\r\nmust bear in mind that as a spur to their artistic sense the people\r\nhad beauty constantly before them. Theirs was a country of smiling\r\nskies, of blue heaven and golden sunshine; their buildings breathed\r\nthe very essence of all that is highest in art; even the throngs that\r\nfilled the streets were picturesque and classic in appearance. For in\r\nthose days fashions of dress did not change as capriciously as they do\r\nnow. A beautiful style of costume was adopted and retained, and in\r\nconsequence artists had ever before them men and women who were\r\nexcellent models for chaste decoration. In our time such a procedure\r\nwould be impossible, as the national dress of both our men and women\r\nhas become utilitarian rather than beautiful, and now has little\r\nartistic to recommend it. If we wish classic draperies and faultless\r\nstyles of hair-dressing we must revert to the past for our models."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence broken only by the snapping of the fire.\r\n\r\n"To give you some idea how much of this pottery the Greeks turned out\r\nI must tell you that at Naples there is a collection of two thousand\r\nGreek cups and vases. The Vatican at Rome has one thousand more;\r\nFlorence has seven hundred; Turin five hundred; Vienna three hundred;\r\nBerlin about seventeen hundred; the Louvre at Paris fifteen hundred;\r\nand the British Museum nearly twenty-six hundred. Besides these there\r\nare some twenty thousand more scattered all over the world in private\r\ncollections."\r\n\r\nA whistle of surprise escaped Theo.\r\n\r\n"Not all of these are equally good, however," went on\r\nMr. Croyden. "The Etruscan work done by wandering Greek potters and by\r\nsome persons rated as identical with the Roman Samian ware, is one of\r\nthe finest varieties remaining to us; probably because it escaped\r\nbeing buried with the dead and therefore was not injured or discolored\r\nby the soil as were so many of the Greek vases found at\r\nAthens. Moreover, we must remember that not every artist who made and\r\ndecorated an object excelled. Naturally some did more perfect work\r\nthan others, even in the days of the best Grecian art. How sad it is\r\nthat at a later period in history the work of the Greeks became less\r\nfine because the ideals of the race degenerated. Pottery makers,\r\nsculptors, and builders began to produce cheap, gaudy things which\r\nwere lavishly decorated, and reflected the luxury and extravagance\r\nthat had crept into the nation. From that moment the glory of Greece\r\ndecayed. For it is the ideals of a country and its people that serve\r\nas guide-posts to the greatest and finest deeds. Unless each\r\nindividual in a land aims at the purest and best his country will\r\nnever reach holiness. It is the struggle for perfection in every field\r\nof life that results in fine art, fine men, and fine nations."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden had become very grave.\r\n\r\nThen he rose abruptly, took out his pipe, and knocked the bowl of it\r\nupon a stump.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," he exclaimed with a swift return to his accustomed\r\ngaiety, "I think I have lectured long enough. See! Manuel has\r\neverything packed up and is waiting for us. Suppose we start back\r\nhome."\r\n\r\nBut Theo was very quiet on the trip back to the camp.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking about the Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHEO MEETS WITH A CALAMITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was when Theo had been three days in camp that the accident\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nOutside the cook-house stood a ladder to be used in case of fire, and\r\nas one morning the boy passed it, it suddenly came to him what fun it\r\nwould be to mount to the ridge-pole of the cabin and toss a handful of\r\ntiny pebbles down on the heads of the guides as they passed through\r\nthe door beneath. What a surprise it would be to Tony and Franz to\r\nhave the stones come clattering down upon them; and what sport it\r\nwould be to watch them as they tried to solve the riddle as to where\r\nthe missiles came from!\r\n\r\nIt was a foolish scheme, and probably had Theo thought it over a\r\nsecond time he would have abandoned it; but he was an impulsive boy\r\nwho often acted before he carefully considered what he was\r\ndoing. Therefore without a moment\'s hesitation he cautiously dragged\r\nthe ladder to the end of the cabin and, making sure that no one was\r\nlooking, began climbing it. He was on the top rung and was just\r\nstepping softly to the roof when there was a snapping of rotten wood\r\nand the bar beneath his foot gave way, sending him crashing headlong\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Theo the cabin was a low one, and he had not far to\r\nfall; but in trying to save himself he twisted one leg beneath him,\r\nand the result was most disastrous. He felt a sudden sharp pain as he\r\nstruck the earth, and when a second later he attempted to rise he\r\ndiscovered to his chagrin that it was impossible for him to do\r\nso. Every movement he made hurt him excruciatingly, and presently\r\nfeeling both faint and dizzy he abandoned further effort.\r\n\r\nFor an interval he lay very still, ashamed to call for help; then\r\npocketing his pride he began to yell lustily. His cries brought Franz\r\nand Manuel from the kitchen, Mr. Croyden from his cabin, and Dr. Swift\r\nfrom his room. Luckily it was just noontime and every one was indoors\r\nawaiting lunch.\r\n\r\nOf what followed Theo had only a vague idea. He remembered that his\r\nfather and Mr. Croyden raised him in their arms, and that in spite of\r\ntheir gentleness he had cried with pain at their touch. Then he had\r\nbeen put on his bed where his father proceeded to examine the injured\r\nleg. Every motion the Doctor made caused the boy intense\r\nagony. Afterward he had been allowed to rest, and then his father bent\r\nover him very gravely and with trembling lips said:\r\n\r\n"Son, I\'ve got to hurt you; I\'ve got to hurt you a great deal. Your\r\nleg is broken, and we are miles from a hospital. I have no ether to\r\ngive you, and the bone must be set. I want you to be as brave as you\r\ncan and bear the pain that I must cause you. I need not tell you that\r\nI will work as gently as possible. Now pull yourself together and show\r\nme the sort of son I have. The more steady your nerve is the more it\r\nwill help me, and the sooner I can finish what I must do."\r\n\r\n"All right, Father."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the stuff!" ejaculated Mr. Croyden, who was standing at the\r\nbedside. "You are a genuine Spartan, Theo."\r\n\r\nThe lad smiled feebly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try to be."\r\n\r\n"Of course you will! You are your father\'s own boy."\r\n\r\nDr. Swift stooped and touched the drawn forehead with his cool hand.\r\n\r\n"I am going to leave you with Mr. Croyden for a few moments while I\r\nget some of the things I need," he said in a low tone. "Keep perfectly\r\nstill and rest a little if you can. There is no need for you to\r\nworry. We will have you all fixed up within an hour. It is a clean\r\nbreak--a merciful thing, for we couldn\'t take an X-ray of it if we\r\nwanted to."\r\n\r\nWith these words he left the room.\r\n\r\nIt was some little time before he returned, and in the meanwhile\r\nMr. Croyden sat beside Theo\'s bed and talked cheerily.\r\n\r\n"Nothing like traveling with your own doctor," he remarked\r\njocosely. "Now if my leg was broken I should have to hire some one in\r\nto see it, and it would cost me a pretty penny. But here you are miles\r\nfrom a settlement with your own private physician in attendance. Were\r\nyou a young prince you could not be more royally cared for. Think of\r\nhaving one of the best New York surgeons at your beck and call here in\r\nthis wilderness. You are a lucky beggar!"\r\n\r\nTheo laughed faintly.\r\n\r\n"As for splints--here is a forest of the finest, straightest, and\r\nstrongest timber. What more can you ask? You couldn\'t do things on a\r\ngrander scale if you were in New York City."\r\n\r\nAgain Theo smiled.\r\n\r\n"Your father will have you comfortable as a cricket before long," went\r\non Mr. Croyden, "and you will be all ready to start back----"\r\n\r\n"Start back!" interrupted Theo in distress. "Oh, surely, Mr. Croyden,\r\nFather is not going to take me home!"\r\n\r\nThe older man hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course I have no way of knowing what your father means to do,"\r\nhe protested hastily. "I only imagined that you would be more\r\ncomfortable at home, and would rather go. There really would not be\r\nmuch point in staying out the month here, would there? You see, you\r\nwon\'t be able to get about, and your father would not like to go off\r\nevery day and leave you here alone in camp."\r\n\r\n"But Father has spent all this money to come into the woods, and he\r\nhas looked forward to the trip so much!" groaned Theo. "Besides, he is\r\nvery tired and needs the rest; he told me so. If he takes me back home\r\nhe will miss it all! He doesn\'t want the vacation just for his own\r\nfun, but so he can serve our country better if he is needed. I don\'t\r\nsee why we couldn\'t stay on here just as we planned, even if I have a\r\nbroken leg," was Theo\'s concluding plea.\r\n\r\n"Think how stupid it would be for you to be left in the house alone."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t care. I could find some way to amuse myself."\r\n\r\n"But your father----"\r\n\r\n"He could go fishing just as he always does!" exclaimed Theo\r\npromptly. "You surely don\'t suppose I\'d be so selfish as to make him\r\nstay in the house just because I had to, do you? You see"--Theo\r\ncolored and then went on bravely--"this accident was my own\r\nfault. Father told me the other day to let that ladder alone--and I\r\ndidn\'t. It serves me right to break my leg. If I had been in Dad\'s\r\nplace I\'d have said: _I told you so_. But he didn\'t even whisper\r\nit. He was just patient and kind as he always is. Can\'t you understand\r\nnow, Mr. Croyden, that I am the one to be punished--not Dad? If we go\r\nback home it will be punishing him too, and that wouldn\'t be fair,\r\nwould it?"\r\n\r\n"No, not fair at all," admitted Mr. Croyden slowly.\r\n\r\n"That is what I think," nodded Theo. "You see, I am the one to\r\nsuffer."\r\n\r\n"If you disobeyed, I guess you are."\r\n\r\n"I did disobey."\r\n\r\n"Humph! It was a pity."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry; but it is done now," said Theo soberly. "You know how you\r\nfeel when you\'ve done wrong. It\'s bad enough anyhow; and it makes you\r\nfeel a hundred times worse if somebody else gets the blame for what\r\nyou\'ve done--somebody who doesn\'t deserve it."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"So, you see, that is why I want you to urge Father to stay on here,"\r\nbegged Theo. "Tell him the Maine air will do me good; tell him I\'ll\r\nget a fine rest keeping still; tell him--oh, tell him _anything_; only\r\ndon\'t let him pack up and go home, and have his whole vacation\r\nspoiled. If you\'ll just get him to stay, Mr. Croyden, I will promise\r\nnot to bother, and he can go off every day and fish just as if I\r\nweren\'t here."\r\n\r\n"You are a trump, Theo."\r\n\r\n"It--it is only that I think it\'s square, sir," faltered Theo.\r\n\r\nThere was not time for further discussion, for at this juncture the\r\ndoor opened and Dr. Swift, followed by Manuel, entered.\r\n\r\nTheo knew the moment for his boasted heroism had come.\r\n\r\nHe shut his lips tightly, and although the interval of anguish which\r\nfollowed forced the tears from his eyes he made no outcry. But never\r\nin his life had he experienced such pain. He did not know there was\r\nsuch pain in all the world.\r\n\r\nWhen it was over and, faint from suffering, he lay languidly back\r\namong the pillows, Dr. Swift\'s stern face relaxed, and it was then\r\nTheo realized for the first time that his father, too, had been\r\nbracing himself to meet the ordeal and had also been suffering.\r\n\r\n"My poor boy!" was all the Doctor said. "You have borne it like a\r\nman! I am proud of you, Theo."\r\n\r\nThe words were few, but the praise was at that moment very precious.\r\n\r\nHis father sat with him the remainder of the day, as well as a good\r\npart of the night, and during the wakeful hours when the boy tossed to\r\nand fro he would have ventured to speak about staying in camp had not\r\nDr. Swift bidden him to be quiet every time he attempted to talk. The\r\nnext morning, however, after the invalid had been bathed and had his\r\nbreakfast the Doctor said of his own accord:\r\n\r\n"So you think you would be happier to remain here in the woods, Theo,\r\ninstead of going home."\r\n\r\nThe lad glanced up in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Did Mr. Croyden tell you that?"\r\n\r\nDr. Swift nodded.\r\n\r\n"He said you\'d like to stay," he returned quickly.\r\n\r\n"I should, very much."\r\n\r\n"Suppose we call it settled then, and say no more about it. I am sure\r\nI have no wish to jolt you over those miles of rough corduroy road if\r\nit can be avoided. You seem better this morning. Your fever has gone\r\ndown, and I see no reason why you should not get on all right from now\r\non."\r\n\r\nTheo smiled; then he whispered timidly:\r\n\r\n"I just want to tell you I\'m sorry I disobeyed you, Father."\r\n\r\nHis father put out his hand gently and covered the boy\'s two with his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n"You have the worst of it, son. Experience is a great teacher, they\r\nsay. Let it help you not to do such a foolish thing again."\r\n\r\nTheo met his father\'s eyes gratefully. He still felt weak and shaken\r\nand he was thankful not to have his fault rubbed in.\r\n\r\nDuring the long hours of the long days that followed the lad had many\r\nan opportunity to put his unselfish resolutions into practise. He\r\ninsisted that his father and Mr. Croyden go off on the long tramps\r\nthey had each season been accustomed to take together, and during\r\ntheir absence he remained with Franz, who was very kind to him. The\r\nIndian had a great many devices for entertaining him. Now he fashioned\r\nfor the boy\'s amusement a miniature birch-bark canoe; now he showed\r\nhim how to weave baskets from lithe twigs of alder. Sometimes he\r\nwhittled wonderful whistles and toys from bits of wood; sometimes made\r\ntiny bows and arrows or snowshoes. His resources seemed never\r\nending.\r\n\r\nThen when night came and Dr. Swift and Mr. Croyden returned from\r\nfishing Theo was always carried into the living-room of the cabin, and\r\nwhile he lay on the couch before the fire he would listen to the tale\r\nof the day\'s adventures. This bedtime hour was the best in the whole\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a morning when Theo awoke to hear a storm beating\r\nnoisily down upon the roof. The wind was blowing hard and sheets of\r\nrain drenched the windows.\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be no fishing to-day," announced Dr. Swift after\r\nbreakfast. "Instead Manuel is going out over the carry for provisions,\r\nand before he goes I must write some letters for him to take. In the\r\nmeantime Mr. Croyden wants to know if you would like to have him come\r\nin and talk with you for a while?"\r\n\r\n"Like it!" was the delighted exclamation.\r\n\r\n"I believe I hear him now. Yes, here he is. Come in, Croyden!" called\r\nthe Doctor heartily. "Our patient says he will be glad to see you."\r\n\r\n"Glad? I should say I should!"\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden chuckled.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that any audience ever gave me such a royal welcome\r\nbefore," he declared with amusement. "How do you find yourself this\r\nmorning, sonny? Able to talk Greek pottery?"\r\n\r\n"Able to hear you talk it," Theo answered instantly.\r\n\r\n"I am thinking of shifting my subject to-day and telling you about\r\nChinese and Japanese pottery instead."\r\n\r\n"That will be fine."\r\n\r\n"Very well, we\'ll begin our lecture right away, since the audience\r\nseems to be assembled," observed Mr. Croyden merrily. "Not only have\r\nyou a private physician but a private lecturer, you see. My, but you\r\nare a royal personage! One thing will be very satisfactory about this\r\naudience. No matter whether it likes my talk or not it can\'t run\r\naway."\r\n\r\nThere was a peal of laughter from Theo.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mr. Croyden poked the fire into a blaze and sitting\r\ndown in a comfortable chair began his story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMR. CROYDEN\'S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\n"Hundreds and hundreds of years ago," said Mr. Croyden, "while the\r\nEgyptians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Romans were experimenting at\r\npottery-making, the Chinese, inside their great walled country, were\r\nbusy with the same task. In fact as far back as two thousand years\r\nbefore Christ the Chinese were famous potters, making earthenware of\r\nsuch fine quality that it was difficult to tell whether it was pottery\r\nor porcelain. For the two are quite different, you must remember,\r\nTheo. It is not enough to say that pottery is thick and porcelain\r\nthin, for much of the Chinese and Japanese pottery is very thin\r\nindeed. The difference lies in the clay itself, of which the ware is\r\nmade. Do not forget that. Pottery is an opaque ware composed of\r\nvarious combinations of clay which afterward may or may not have a\r\ncoating of glaze put over it. But genuine porcelain is made from a\r\nmixture of quite different materials--a mixture of decomposed feldspar\r\nknown as kaolin, and petuntse."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden paused a moment.\r\n\r\n"There are of course so-called porcelains made from other ingredients;\r\nbut we call them soft paste chinas, and do not rate them as true\r\nporcelains. Only a hard paste, or kaolin ware, is acknowledged by\r\nexperts to be genuine porcelain. Now all this sounds very simple. By\r\nputting the kaolin and the petuntse together in the right proportions,\r\nmoulding the clay, and afterward applying to it a glaze of some sort\r\nthe Chinese made their porcelain, and very beautiful porcelain it\r\nwas. Some day I will tell you more about it. This porcelain was not\r\nonly very hard but was semi-translucent; by that I mean that if it was\r\nheld to the light one could see the glow through it. It was not, of\r\ncourse, transparent like glass. These two qualities of hardness and\r\ntranslucence help us to distinguish porcelain from pottery."\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Croyden stopped.\r\n\r\n"For example, Canton ware, commonly known as Canton china, is not\r\nreally china at all, but is instead a fine quality of stone, or\r\nearthenware, coated over with a slip or glaze containing porcelain.\r\nNor is the exquisite Satsuma ware china; that too is a pottery."\r\n\r\nTheo listened intently.\r\n\r\n"Now all this time the Chinese kept the secret of how they made their\r\nwares to themselves, not sharing their knowledge with any outside\r\npeoples. Many a nation would have given almost anything to know from\r\nwhat materials the beautiful bowls, vases, and dishes were made. It\r\nwould have saved years and years of the toil of patient men. But the\r\nChinese had no mind to tell any one. Instead, they went on making more\r\nand more pottery and porcelain, improving their work with each\r\nsuccessive generation. It is amusing to recall that while our\r\nancestors in England were barbarians, and were eating out of the\r\ncrudest clay vessels or from trenchers of wood, the Chinese were\r\nenjoying the luxury of the finest pottery and porcelain."\r\n\r\nTheo\'s eyes opened very wide.\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly the Chinese deserved the good results they obtained, for\r\nthey selected their clays with extreme care; ground and mixed them\r\nmost skilfully; modeled each piece with the keenest feeling for its\r\nbeauty and perfection; and decorated it in a truly artistic spirit.\r\n\r\n"In the meantime they constantly became more and more expert. They\r\nbegan to learn the use of colors, and to perfect them. Some of the\r\nblues or cobalts they employed have never been surpassed. One for\r\ninstance is the blue used on their Nankin china, and known as Nankin\r\nblue."\r\n\r\n"Did the Japanese make pottery too?" questioned Theo.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but we do not know exactly how early they began to make\r\nit. Probably some of the Japanese crossed to China and there learned\r\nthe art. Some think pottery-making came into Japan through\r\nKorea. However that may be, long before other countries had to any\r\nextent perfected the manufacture of glazed pottery and porcelain\r\nChina, Japan, Persia, and India had turned their attention to it. As\r\nfar back as 1000 B. C. the Japanese were making porcelains\r\nsimilar to those of China. Then followed a long stretch of years when,\r\nbecause of various wars between China and Japan, the art of producing\r\nglazed pottery and porcelain was lost. All those workmen who possessed\r\nany knowledge of their manufacture perished. This was the period when\r\nthe Greeks and Romans were making their red and black ware which, you\r\nrecall, they did not know how to glaze, and therefore had no means of\r\npreventing liquids from leaking through it."\r\n\r\n"I wish they had had the secrets of the Chinese and Japanese!" Theo\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"I wish so too," echoed Mr. Croyden. "As it was, they struggled along\r\nwith their beautiful pottery vases through which the water percolated\r\njust as it does through a flower-pot. And so it was for a time in\r\nChina and Japan. It was not until centuries afterward that the Chinese\r\nand Japanese again rediscovered the art they had lost, and by that\r\ntime the Greeks and Romans were no more, newer races having taken\r\ntheir places. Some of the wonderful old enamel work of the Chinese,\r\nhowever, was never reclaimed, and rare pieces of porcelain of a kind\r\nno one has yet been able to reproduce remain to tell us of the skill\r\nof those ancient Chinese workmen."\r\n\r\n"If the Chinese kept everything so secret how did the art of glazed\r\npottery-making ever get into Europe?" asked Theo.\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden smiled.\r\n\r\n"It was a marvel that it ever did," he answered slowly. "Of course as\r\npeople traveled little in those days one country did not know much\r\nabout what another was doing. But there were wars when much booty was\r\ncarried from one land to another; the pilgrimages of the Crusaders,\r\ntoo, helped to spread a knowledge of widely separated sections.\r\nGradually bits of Chinese pottery and porcelain found their way into\r\ndifferent parts of the East; and as a consequence men began to be\r\nhighly dissatisfied with their red and black ware, and with the crude\r\nclay dishes they had previously thought so fine. They wanted to make\r\nwhite ware like that of the Chinese. But because they did not know\r\nwhat clays to use, or how to glaze their products, all their\r\nexperiments failed. There did nevertheless appear throughout the\r\nOrient a ware of common clay over which a simple covering of white had\r\nbeen painted, and this slip or engobe of white gave to the variety the\r\nname of Oriental Engobe. This type of ware decorated with a\r\nconventional dull-hued design was many years later revived and\r\nimitated by Theodore Deck of Paris, one of the great French porcelain\r\nmakers. But even this was not like the white Chinese ware everybody\r\nwanted so much to make."\r\n\r\n"Did they never find out the secret?"\r\n\r\n"Of that I will tell you some other time. It is a most interesting\r\nstory," returned Mr. Croyden. "In the meantime the Moors and Arabs\r\nwho had lived in the Orient had in some way learned that tin or lead\r\ncould be used for enameling clay surfaces. The discovery\r\napparently did not particularly interest them because, you see, in the\r\nEast minerals were not plentiful. When, however, in the twelfth\r\ncentury they conquered Spain they found in that country quantities of\r\nlead and tin, and they then recalled that these could be used as a\r\nglaze for pottery. In consequence they promptly set to work making an\r\nenameled ware called Majolica or Maiolica from the Island of Maiorca.\r\nThese Moors were a highly cultured race who built in Spain beautiful\r\ntemples and palaces, among them the Alhambra, of which perhaps you\r\nhave read."\r\n\r\nTheo\'s eyes shone.\r\n\r\n"We read about it at school!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear that," exclaimed Mr. Croyden. "Then you will\r\nremember what a wonderful structure it was. In its interior have been\r\nfound many highly glazed tiles beautifully designed and decorated in\r\ncolors and in gold. Within this palace, too, was found the famous\r\nAlhambra Vase, three feet four inches in height, and made in 1320. It\r\nis a piece of work quite different from anything the Greeks made, but\r\nin its way is quite as perfect. It is of earthenware, with a white\r\nground, and is enameled in two shades of blue with a further\r\ndecoration of gold or copper lustre. I speak particularly of this use\r\nof glaze because it is very important. Until people knew how to glaze\r\ntheir wares many of the comforts and conveniences of living were\r\nimpossible. Men carried water or wine in leather gourds, or in clay\r\nvessels coated on the inside with a layer of gum to prevent the\r\ncontents from leaking or evaporating."\r\n\r\n"I should think the gum would have made the liquid taste," said Theo.\r\n\r\n"It did. That was precisely the trouble. Beside that think of the\r\nwaste. Suppose you lost half the water you needed for your journey by\r\nhaving it evaporate. Think in addition what it meant if a large part\r\nof your food dried up in the cooking."\r\n\r\nTheo looked grave.\r\n\r\n"I should not like that at all."\r\n\r\n"Nor did your ancestors," laughed Mr. Croyden. "Well, it was to\r\nthese Mohammedan Arabs, or Saracens, as they are termed, that Europe\r\nfundamentally owed its knowledge of the use of glaze, and its\r\nconsequent beginning in the art of pottery-making. The Saracens did\r\nnot, however, remain in Spain. There was an uprising of the Christians\r\nand they were either driven out or slaughtered, almost every relic of\r\ntheir civilization being destroyed. A stray temple or palace alone\r\nremains as a monument to them and this was more the result of chance,\r\nprobably, than of intention. For two centuries following came an\r\ninterval known as the Dark Ages, when none of the arts flourished.\r\nBut before the Moors had fled from Spain the Italians who lived near\r\nat hand and whose territory the invaders often plundered had tired of\r\ntheir pillaging and in return had made an expedition into the\r\nSaracens\' country bringing back with them to Italy some of the\r\nMajolica ware of the Arabs. When the nations began to awaken out of\r\ntheir two hundred years of warfare and strife, and Genoa, Venice, and\r\nLeghorn became great commercial centres, then the Renaissance came and\r\nthe Italians, who were ever an ingenious people, began among other\r\nthings to attempt to copy the glaze on this Majolica ware. As a result\r\nin the fifteenth century Luca della Robbia, who was both a sculptor\r\nand a potter, contrived to perfect his wonderful glazed terra cotta."\r\n\r\n"Not the Delia Robbia who did the Singing Boys we have on the wall at\r\nschool!"\r\n\r\n"The very same. He made great blue and white enameled tiles for wall\r\ndecoration too; figures of babies and children, as well as whole\r\naltars fashioned entirely from this beautiful enamel. Whether he used\r\na plumbiferous, or lead glaze; or a stanniferous, or tin glaze, we do\r\nnot know. Probably it was of tin. But the important fact is that he\r\ngot a fine durable surface, very shiny and very hard, which wrought a\r\nrevolution in pottery-making. If you visit Florence some time you can\r\nstill see set in the walls of some of the public buildings the\r\nidentical enameled terra cottas made by Luca della Robbia."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to see them."\r\n\r\n"Then tell your dad to take you to Italy after this war is over. We\r\nwill pray that Germany may spare these art works of the world."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden did not speak for a moment; then he said:\r\n\r\n"And while you are remembering so many things remember in addition\r\nthat the word _glaze_ comes from the term _glassing_ or _glazing_,\r\nwhich means putting a coating of glass over the surface. Of course\r\nthe covering is not really glass, but it is hard and shiny, and so\r\npeople used to think it was. Some day I will tell you more about the\r\ndifferent kinds of glazes."\r\n\r\n"So it was the Italians who gave Europe its glazed pottery and\r\nporcelain," remarked Theo.\r\n\r\n"Not alone the Italians," protested Mr. Croyden, "although they\r\nhelped. Somebody else had a share in the discovery--somebody very far\r\naway from Italy. It was the knowledge of the Italians combined with\r\nthe skill of this other distant nation that gave to Europe the perfect\r\nproduct."\r\n\r\n"What nation was that?" demanded Theo.\r\n\r\n"The Dutch."\r\n\r\n"The Dutch!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. You see at this time the Dutch were great traders, and it was\r\nwhile the nation was at the height of its commercial glory that the\r\nDutch began bringing from China shipments of Chinese porcelain.\r\nPortuguese traders had also brought some of it into Europe, so in\r\nthese two ways the beautiful blue and white ware we know so well was\r\nintroduced to the Continent.\r\n\r\n"The Portuguese were content to import it; they never attempted to\r\ncopy either the pottery or the porcelain. But the Dutch were more\r\nambitious. As early as 1300 they began experimenting with glazed\r\npottery. To the knowledge of glaze which they got from Italy they\r\nadded all they could find out about the making of Chinese wares. They\r\nlearned that the blue color the Chinese got came from oxide of cobalt,\r\nwhich would melt and mingle with the glaze when exposed to a high\r\ntemperature; they also learned a little--a very little, of the\r\nclay. As a result they began to turn out a blue and white pottery\r\nknown as Delft, which they soon made in great quantities and sold to\r\nEuropean nations at a much lower price than imported Chinese potteries\r\nand porcelains could be bought."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden bent forward and tossed a small log upon the fire.\r\n\r\n"This fact revolutionized daily living throughout Europe. Up to this\r\ntime you must remember the common people everywhere were using square\r\npieces of tile or wood for plates, and were eating from wooden bowls\r\nor hollowed out slabs of wood called trenchers. The more well-to-do\r\nused pewter, and kings and queens dined from dishes of silver. There\r\nwas, it is true, some earthenware made in Saxony and France, but as it\r\nwas of a finer and more expensive quality than Delft ordinary persons\r\ncould not afford to buy it.\r\n\r\n"At the time the Dutch began importing their Delft ware into England\r\nHenry IV was on the throne; so you see how long ago all this\r\nhappened."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden smiled mischievously.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you have that date at your tongue\'s end," he added.\r\n\r\n"I think it was about 1400," ventured Theo thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Bravo! I had no idea you would remember it. Henry IV reigned from\r\n1399 to 1413, so you see you are nearly right. As Delft ware began to\r\nbe manufactured in 1310 the art was pretty well developed by this\r\ntime, and much beautiful pottery was being made. Some of the best\r\nDutch painters were trying their hand at its decoration, and in the\r\nMuseums of the Hague there are old Delft pieces painted by many of\r\nthese famous artists. Most of the scenes upon them were copied from\r\nthe landscapes the Dutch saw every day--windmills, ships, Dutch women\r\nin their quaint costumes, fishermen, and children in wooden\r\nshoes,--the ordinary sights, such as were common in Holland, but novel\r\nand interesting to those who lived in other places. There were, too,\r\nmany imitations of Chinese ware adorned with copies of Chinese\r\ndesigns. Bear in mind, Theo, that all of this was pottery, not\r\nporcelain; for the secret of porcelain-making had not yet been\r\nfathomed," said Mr. Croyden impressively.\r\n\r\n"It was glazed pottery," responded Theo.\r\n\r\n"Exactly," nodded Mr. Croyden. "As time went on the Dutch increased\r\nand perfected their output until they became ambitious to make larger\r\npieces. Potters began turning out small foot-stoves, vases,\r\ncandlesticks, and dinner sets. One of the most amusing relics of this\r\nold Delft is now in one of the foreign museums. It is a violin\r\nperfectly modeled and exquisitely decorated. The story goes that it\r\nwas one of four such instruments which were made as wedding gifts for\r\nthe four daughters of a rich Dutch pottery manufacturer. It is even\r\nasserted that the instruments before being presented to the four\r\nbrides were used by the musicians at the wedding festivities. I\'m\r\nafraid they did not make very good music."\r\n\r\nTheo smiled.\r\n\r\n"Besides these fantastic things the Dutch also made tea sets, and when\r\nI say that you must realize that this was a very important fact; for\r\nup to about 1660 tea was a great novelty in England. It had but\r\nrecently been introduced there by Oriental traders, and was very\r\nexpensive, selling for about eight dollars a pound--at that time a\r\ngreat deal of money, and even quite a price when rated by our own\r\nstandards. People were very ignorant still as to its use. You have\r\nprobably heard the story of the servant who, knowing nothing about\r\npreparing the new delicacy, boiled the tea leaves, sprinkled them with\r\nsalt and pepper and, throwing away the liquid, served the dainty to\r\nhis master in a covered dish."\r\n\r\nThere was a hearty laugh from Theo.\r\n\r\n"As late as 1661 an Englishman named Samuel Pepys, whose diary is an\r\ninteresting record of the time, writes: \'_I had to-day some tea--a\r\nChina drink of which I had never drank before._\' Isn\'t it a pity that\r\nwhile he was writing the little man did not also put down how he liked\r\nthis new beverage?"\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden drew out his watch and rose.\r\n\r\n"So you can see, Theo," he added as he stood with his back to the\r\nfire, "what it meant to have tea sets introduced into England. Of\r\ncourse the cups had no handles as do our teacups of to-day. The\r\nChinese cups were in reality small bowls without either saucer or\r\nhandle. Therefore the Delft teacups copied from them were made in the\r\nsame way. The Chinese did not drink their tea very hot, you see, and\r\ntherefore could take hold of the cup without burning their fingers;\r\nmoreover, they used in their houses tables of teak-wood to which hot\r\ncups did no injury. Since, however, teak-wood was unknown in England\r\nand oak was in general use the English found that the hot cups marred\r\ntheir tables and later they invented saucers to go under\r\nthem. Nevertheless it was a long time before it dawned on potters that\r\nthey could make handles for their cups. One of the ear-marks of tea\r\nsets of early manufacture is these handleless cups. With this advent\r\nof dishes, of Delft plaques to be hung on the wall in place of\r\npictures, and of Delft tiles, many of the common people for the first\r\ntime awakened to the discovery that the interiors of their houses\r\nmight be made attractive, and something more than mere shelters from\r\ncold and storm. They began buying vases and crude pottery ornaments,\r\nimages of flower-girls, fishermen, and of the saints. In Holland\r\npeople even hung Delft plaques on the walls of their stables. It was a\r\nnew thought to have anything about which was not for actual use."\r\n\r\n"I should think that with all this Chinese and Delft ware to copy from\r\nthe English would have tried making earthenware of their own,"\r\nspeculated Theo.\r\n\r\n"They did," was Mr. Croyden\'s prompt reply, "and of that I will tell\r\nyou some other day. But there is one interesting fact in connection\r\nwith these early tea sets. Remember that if ever you see in a museum\r\nor private house a tea set which you are told came over in the\r\n_Mayflower_ nothing of the sort could have happened. The Pilgrims\r\nlanded on Plymouth Rock in 1620, and it was not until from 1660 to\r\n1770 that tea and tea sets became general in England. By that time the\r\nPilgrim Fathers, and more especially the Pilgrim Mothers, were far\r\nacross the ocean."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden moved toward the door.\r\n\r\n"Some one may have brought tea sets to them but they never carried\r\nthem in the _Mayflower_," he concluded. "Now I have talked too much\r\nfor one morning, and it is lunch time. Listen, there is the horn! And\r\nsee, Theo, the rain has ceased and the sun come out."\r\n\r\n"I hadn\'t thought of the weather," smiled Theo. "I had not thought of\r\nanything, I guess, but what you were telling me. You will come again,\r\nsir?"\r\n\r\n"Surely!"\r\n\r\n"And you won\'t forget your promise to tell me about English pottery?"\r\n\r\n"No indeed, son," was the cordial reply. "You are too good a listener\r\nfor me to forget."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE POTTER WHO BURNED HIS CHAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not for some time that Mr. Croyden again had leisure for a\r\nlong talk with Theo, because with the return of pleasant weather he\r\nand Dr. Swift went for a three days\' canoe trip up Elk River, a small\r\nstream emptying into the lake on which the camp stood. Dr. Swift had\r\nthought of giving up this excursion, because it necessitated leaving\r\nTheo for such a long time; but the boy was insistent that his father\r\nshould go.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t be lonesome, Father," he protested. "Franz is here, and he\r\nis as good as a vaudeville show; besides I can read, and whittle, and\r\nwrite to Mother. The days will pass so quickly I shall not have time\r\nto miss you. It would be too bad to have you stay in camp just for\r\nme. I have made trouble enough already."\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was because of Theo\'s genuine regret for what he had done\r\nthat Dr. Swift consented to carry out his original plan. The boy was\r\nintensely sensitive, and any allusion to his accident, or any\r\ninterference with his father\'s pleasure because of it, immediately\r\nbrought a shadow of distress to his face. The Doctor was quick to\r\nnotice this fact; and eager, if possible, to avoid every reminder of\r\nthe disaster. Accordingly on hearing Theo\'s plea he packed his tackle,\r\nand with a gentle word of caution to the invalid to be careful during\r\nhis absence, set forth with Mr. Croyden to fish Elk River.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy thing for Theo to play an unselfish part and see them\r\nstart off. How he wished that he, too, were going! But for his own\r\nfolly he might have gone. Well, he had no one to blame but himself,\r\nthat was certain. Therefore he put as brave a front on the matter as\r\nhe could, resolving to make the best of it and be cheerful.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, much fun to be lying there in bed during those\r\nfine spring days. From his window he could see the blue waters of the\r\nlake between the aisles of straight pines. It was a glorious world if\r\none could only be abroad in it. Even the glimpse he had of it from\r\nhis bed was beautiful. But to lie still and look out upon this\r\nalluring scene was not a satisfying r\xc3\xb4le for an active boy. In spite\r\nof the wood-carving, the books, the writing; even despite the time\r\nFranz could spare to entertain him the hours dragged pitifully.\r\nFurthermore, now that the severed bone had begun to knit he felt\r\nrestless and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nHence when on the afternoon of the third day he awoke from an uneasy\r\ndoze to find his father standing beside him it was a joyful surprise.\r\n\r\n"Father!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"Right here," came gruffly from the Doctor. "Glad to have your old\r\ndad home again?"\r\n\r\n"Glad? Well, I guess!"\r\n\r\n"I am glad to see you again too, son. I\'ve thought of you a hundred\r\ntimes. How did you get on?"\r\n\r\n"All right, sir. Franz took fine care of me, and I found lots of\r\nthings to do," answered Theo bravely. "But it is much nicer when you\r\nare here than when you\'re not."\r\n\r\nHis father smiled.\r\n\r\n"You are a plucky youngster," he said huskily. "No matter how silly\r\nand childish your accident was you certainly have shown yourself a man\r\nsince. Look! Here comes Mr. Croyden to see you. He has brought you a\r\nfine four-pounder, the record trout of the catch."\r\n\r\nTheo beamed.\r\n\r\nDuring the time the fishermen had been gone he had sadly missed the\r\ndelicacy of fresh fish.\r\n\r\n"Eating this trout will be the next best thing to pulling it in,\r\nTheo," said Mr. Croyden. "I only wish you might have had that\r\npleasure, too."\r\n\r\n"I shall be pretty glad to eat the trout, sir," Theo declared\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\n"We shall let Franz get to work cooking it then, right away, so to\r\nhave it ready for your dinner," Dr. Swift said, passing out with the\r\nfish in his hand.\r\n\r\nAfter the Doctor had gone Theo looked up into Mr. Croyden\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you are dreadfully tired after your tramp," he remarked.\r\n\r\n"I? Oh, no," was the instant answer. "Why?"\r\n\r\n"I--I--don\'t know," faltered Theo. "I just wondered."\r\n\r\n"Wondered what?"\r\n\r\n"Whether after dinner you would be too tired to come in and talk to me\r\na little while?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed. I\'d be glad to come," responded Mr. Croyden. "I\'ll come\r\nand tell you all about our trip."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t mind I\'d rather you\'d leave that to Dad, and instead\r\ntell me some more about china-making," Theo said naively.\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden seemed vastly amused at the remark.\r\n\r\n"Bless my soul! What a boy you are," he said. "Of course I am\r\nperfectly willing to talk to you on anything you like. Would you\r\nrather hear about china than anything else?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, just now I should," came vigorously from Theo.\r\n\r\n"All righty, china it shall be, then! But I am surprised that you\r\nshould be so much interested in it. How came you to be so eager to\r\nlearn about pottery and porcelain?"\r\n\r\n"I guess because you make it all so much like a story book," answered\r\nTheo frankly. "How did you happen to know so much about it, Mr.\r\nCroyden?"\r\n\r\n"Why, it chances to be my business, son," Mr. Croyden replied. "In\r\nTrenton, New Jersey, where I live, we make quantities of earthenware\r\nand porcelain; more of it than anywhere else in the United\r\nStates. That is the way I earn my money to come on fishing trips."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see! Then of course it is no wonder that you know all about\r\nit!" cried Theo.\r\n\r\n"I know some things, but not all," was Mr. Croyden\'s\r\nanswer. "However, since you like to hear about it I am ready and glad\r\nto tell you what I can. We will have a session on French pottery\r\nto-night, if you say so; there are some things I want you to know\r\nbefore we take up the making of the English wares."\r\n\r\n"Whatever you say!" exclaimed Theo.\r\n\r\n"Very well. I\'ll be back after dinner, and unless your father wants\r\nyou for something else we\'ll have a nice evening together before your\r\nbedtime."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden was as good as his word.\r\n\r\nTheo had just finished his share of the big trout when into his room\r\ncame the china merchant.\r\n\r\n"Your father and Manuel are busy icing some fish to ship home, so here\r\nI am," he affirmed.\r\n\r\nAfter dragging a steamer chair up to Theo\'s bedside and stretching\r\nhimself comfortably in it the elder man began:\r\n\r\n"Most of the pottery of the seventeenth century was an outgrowth of\r\nthe Italian Renaissance when all the arts such as painting,\r\nwood-carving, sculpture, literature, glass and pottery-making were\r\nrevived. In France the attempt to imitate Italian Faenza ware gave\r\nrise to the word _faience_, a term applied to French porcelains made\r\nboth from hard and soft paste. French potters at Nevers, spurred on by\r\nDutch and Chinese products, began to turn out a type of pottery not\r\nunlike Delft, except that the method of coloring it was reversed, and\r\ninstead of having blue figures on a white ground it had white figures\r\non a background of blue. This innovation, however, was not an entirely\r\nnew variety of pottery. It still remained for France to invent its own\r\npeculiar kind of ware, and this it soon did. Nevertheless you must not\r\nmake the mistake of thinking that these first attempts were very far\r\nreaching, for on the contrary they were very limited. They are\r\nsignificant only because they are the beginnings of that wonderful art\r\nof porcelain-making which later the French carried to an amazing\r\ndegree of perfection."\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s delay in the story while Mr. Croyden rearranged\r\nmore comfortably the pillows behind Theo\'s head.\r\n\r\n"Is that better?" he asked of the boy.\r\n\r\n"Lots better, thank you," said Theo gratefully.\r\n\r\n"All right, son. Then we\'ll go on. Two of the most important of these\r\nbeginnings are the Henri Deux ware, as it is called; and the enamel\r\nwork of Bernard Palissy."\r\n\r\n"We read about Palissy in school," put in Theo.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear that, for he was one of the three men whose names\r\nhave come down to us as being most vitally connected with pottery and\r\nporcelain-making. But before we talk of him I am going to tell you\r\njust a little about the Henri Deux ware, sometimes known as Faience\r\nd\'Orion. Very few pieces of it now remain; but for perfection of\r\nworkmanship and beauty of quality it has never been approached. Just\r\nwho made it we do not know; nor do we know anything of the conditions\r\nunder which it was manufactured. Only about fifty pieces of it are in\r\nexistence--half of them in England and half in France; and it is from\r\nthese, and from vague historic hints, that we have welded together the\r\nrather uncertain tale that I am now to tell you."\r\n\r\nA smile of anticipation passed over Theo\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Long ago there lived in France a wealthy woman named Helene\r\nd\'Hengest, who was deeply interested in all the arts, and who owned a\r\nbeautiful home known as Ch\xc3\xa2teau d\'Orion. Here she had a library, a\r\nrather rare possession in those days, and a librarian called\r\nBernard. Now many persons think that it was this Bernard who was the\r\nmaker of the now famous Henri Deux ware, or Faience d\'Orion."\r\n\r\n"Why should they think that?" questioned Theo.\r\n\r\n"Well, there are several excellent reasons," Mr. Croyden\r\nreplied. "One is that the ware shows traces of a book-binding\r\ntool. Book-binders, you know, use many small instruments to decorate\r\nor tool their leather. This faience was a ware of natural\r\ncream-colored clay, and upon it was tooled a flat design the hollows\r\nof which were filled in with darker clays that were afterward covered\r\nwith a lead glaze. Infinite care and pains had evidently been expended\r\nupon each piece of the ware, such pains that it must have taken much\r\ntime to complete even a single article. No manufacturer could have\r\nafforded to do this, and therefore the inference had been drawn that\r\nthe pottery was made purely for pleasure by some one who had an\r\nabundance of leisure. Perhaps this very Bernard, the librarian, who\r\nmay have become interested in the art as a recreation, and done the\r\nwork in his idle hours."\r\n\r\n"What a funny thing to do as a pastime!" exclaimed Theo.\r\n\r\n"No stranger than that now many persons take up metal work,\r\nwood-carving, or other of the so-called arts and crafts for\r\ndiversion."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not," admitted Theo thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"It certainly is possible such a thing might have happened even so\r\nlong ago as the time when the Henri Deux ware was made. History offers\r\nus no aid in solving the puzzle, so we can only find an answer as best\r\nwe may. The ware, however, is unique, and there is no mistaking it.\r\nSome of it bears the monogram of King Henry II, and that accounts for\r\nthe name by which the product passes. There are authorities that\r\nassert the H does not stand for the king\'s name, but for Helene,\r\nmistress of the Ch\xc3\xa2teau d\'Orion; others declare the king\'s monogram\r\nwas used merely to fix the date when the pottery was made. Hence you\r\nwill find some china collectors calling it Henri Deux ware, and others\r\nspeaking of it as Faience d\'Orion; while still others refer to it as\r\nSaint Porchaire. When examining it it is interesting to notice how\r\nmuch finer the later pieces are than the earlier ones. Evidently\r\nBernard, if Bernard it was, improved a great deal with practice."\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that Mr. Croyden had no more to say about the elusive\r\nBernard, for he came to an abrupt stop.\r\n\r\nTheo waited a second, and then remarked suggestively:\r\n\r\n"And Palissy?"\r\n\r\n"Palissy? Oh, he was another matter altogether. What did you learn\r\nabout him when you were at school?"\r\n\r\n"Not much, I\'m afraid," responded Theo with a shrug. "At least I do\r\nnot remember much of it now. The teacher told us that one day Palissy\r\nsaw an enameled cup of Saracen workmanship and that he was so anxious\r\nto discover how the glaze on it was made that he worked years\r\nexperimenting; he even chopped up all his furniture as fuel for his\r\nfurnaces."\r\n\r\n"This is quite correct," smiled Mr. Croyden. "I see you recall a good\r\ndeal. What you have told me are the main facts of the story. Palissy\r\ndid work fifteen years. He used every splinter of wood he could lay\r\nhands on as fuel, and indeed burned up every particle of his household\r\nfurniture, until he had not a chair to sit upon. He spent every cent\r\nhe had, too, until he was so poor that he could scarcely feed his\r\nfamily, and owed money to all his neighbors."\r\n\r\n"In the end did he find out how to make the enamel?" came breathlessly\r\nfrom Theo.\r\n\r\n"No, not that particular kind of enamel the Moors made in Spain. That\r\nis the sad part of the story," replied Mr. Croyden. "He did, however,\r\nfind out by his experimenting how to get marvelous colored enamels of\r\nanother kind, and this was a very important discovery. He colored his\r\nglazes before putting them over the clay, instead of using a white\r\nenamel and then painting it as had previously been done everywhere. So\r\nyou see after all Palissy did a great deal for pottery-making, since\r\nup to this time no one had ever thought of coloring the glaze\r\nitself. He made many vases, platters, and covered dishes adorned with\r\ndesigns in this colored enamel, often putting on the cover of a dish a\r\nfruit or vegetable in relief, tinted in its natural colors. Much of\r\nthis work now can be seen in the museums of France; but it never\r\nbecame a distinctive type of art. What we chiefly remember of Palissy\r\nis his introduction into china-making of these hitherto unknown\r\ncolored enamels."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNED HIS CHAIRS "HE USED EVERY SPLINTER OF WOOD"]\r\n\r\n"What became of him?" inquired Theo at last. "Did he ever get any\r\nmore money?"\r\n\r\n"He had a strange life," mused Mr. Croyden. "He was a Huguenot, and\r\nat that time the Catholic party was in power, and an edict went forth\r\nthat all Huguenots should be killed. Many of them fled into other\r\ncountries and thus escaped death. But Palissy refused to flee, and\r\nbecause he was a man skilled in pottery-making, one of the things\r\nFrance was eager to perfect, the king wanted to retain him in his\r\nkingdom. Therefore he took Palissy under his protection, and for a\r\nlong time allowed him to work unmolested in a little building in the\r\ngrounds of the Tuileries. But by and by the Catholic adherents of the\r\nking became too strong even for their royal master\'s control, and so\r\ninsistently did they clamor for Palissy\'s death that the king was\r\nforced to send for the potter and beg him to renounce his Protestant\r\nfaith. Now by this time Palissy was a white-haired man of\r\neighty. Nevertheless when the king told him he must either recant or\r\nlose his life he did not flinch. Fearlessly he clung to his religion."\r\n\r\n"Did they kill him?"\r\n\r\n"No. Perhaps it was because the people did not dare displease the\r\nking," answered Mr. Croyden. "They did, however, imprison the old man\r\nin the Bastille and there, after years of confinement, he wasted away\r\nand died. It was probably only the influence of his royal patron that\r\nprevented him from being murdered in the first place. Both the\r\nHenri Deux ware and Palissy\'s colored enamels brought fame to\r\nFrance. In 1800 at Nevers, where the blue and white ware similar to\r\nDelft was made, there were twelve factories. Then there was a quaint\r\npottery made at Beauvais with the coats of arms of France and Brittany\r\nupon it. At Rouen, too, an extensive pottery industry sprang up, and\r\nit was to these factories that in 1713 Louis XIV, when forced to pay\r\nhis war debts, sent his silver service to be melted up and replaced by\r\na less expensive earthenware dinner set. Some pieces marked with the\r\nfleur-de-lis, and probably remnants of this set, are to be found in\r\nFrench museums. There were various other small potteries in different\r\nparts of France: some at Marseilles, others at Moustiers and Nancy.\r\nThere were a number in Paris itself. All of these were making a more\r\nor less fine variety of earthenware. But the time was not ripe for\r\nFrance\'s greatest contribution to china-making. Of that you shall hear\r\nsome other day. Now have I not told you quite a long story?"\r\n\r\n"A long one and a very good one," said Theo. "I hope you\'ll tell me\r\nanother very soon."\r\n\r\n"Will you never have enough of all this chinaware?"\r\n\r\nLaughingly Theo shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like you to keep right on until----"\r\n\r\n"Until you are on your feet again," interrupted Mr. Croyden\r\nteasingly. "Then I suppose you will promptly run off and forget all\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"Not at all, sir!" contradicted Theo. "I was going to say I wished you\r\nwould keep on telling me about it until I got well and could go to see\r\nsome of these potteries and porcelains made."\r\n\r\n"Oh-ho! So you want to come to Trenton and steal my business away from\r\nme, do you, you young rascal? We\'ll see about that."\r\n\r\nWith a broad smile Mr. Croyden rose and shaking his fist playfully at\r\nTheo sauntered out the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nFROM VASES TO DRAIN-PIPES\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the week that followed neither Dr. Swift nor Mr. Croyden took\r\nany more long trips away from the camp. They went, to be sure, on\r\nshort fishing excursions, often being absent an entire morning or\r\nafternoon; but they passed no nights away from Theo. The boy suspected\r\nthat his father\'s reason for this decision was because for the last\r\nfew days try as he would he had been unable to conceal how miserable\r\nand uncomfortable he felt. Dr. Swift, however, would not own that this\r\nwas the cause of his loitering at home. He merely declared that when\r\nthe near-at-hand sport was so good it was foolish to tramp ten miles\r\nto waylay some unwary and distant trout. And indeed this logic\r\nappeared to be sound, for not once did the anglers return from one of\r\ntheir brief tours that they did not bring with them baskets well lined\r\nwith yellow perch, trout, or land-loch salmon.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence the Doctor managed to keep very close watch of his\r\nson, and Theo saw a great deal both of his father and Mr. Croyden.\r\n\r\nThe friendship of the latter for the sick lad was no empty pose.\r\n\r\nHe sincerely liked Theo--liked his manliness and his intelligence; his\r\nbrave attempt at unselfishness; his boyish love of fun.\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden was very fond of boys and, in fact, often betrayed the\r\ncircumstance that in reality he himself had never really grown up.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he sought Theo out whenever he had leisure, and many a\r\nhappy hour did the two spend together.\r\n\r\nOne day when he chanced to be sitting beside the invalid\'s couch Theo\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"You told me once that there were three famous potters in history, and\r\nthat Palissy was one of them; who were the others?"\r\n\r\n"If I should tell you their names and nothing more about them it would\r\nbe only so much dry sawdust," was Mr. Croyden\'s reply. "The only\r\nreason they were great was because of what they did; and that is a\r\nlong story."\r\n\r\n"Too long to tell?"\r\n\r\n"Too long to put in a nutshell."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t you have time to tell me some of it now?"\r\n\r\n"I might have time to tell you about one of the men, but not both; and\r\neven were I to tell you about one of them, in order to make you\r\nunderstand how truly great he was I should have to tell you much that\r\nhappened before he began his pottery-making," answered Mr. Croyden\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t mind that at all," laughed Theo. "The longer your\r\nstories are the better I like them."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden smiled.\r\n\r\n"Suppose, then, we begin," he said, "and I will try before luncheon to\r\nintroduce you to our second great potter. But before I do this we must\r\ngo back a little that you may recall exactly where we left off. While\r\nHolland was turning out its Delft ware; Italy its glazed terra-cotta;\r\nand France its Henri Deux and other enameled earthenwares, in the Low\r\nCountries and the German States a new variety of pottery with a coarse\r\nsurface not unlike the porous skin of an orange was being made. This\r\nwas known as Gres de Flandres, _gres_ meaning earthenware. The unique\r\nfeature it possessed was not so much its orange-skin surface as the\r\nsurprising method by which it was glazed. The ware itself was made on\r\na potter\'s wheel often from the commonplace kinds of clay, such as are\r\nemployed in making stone china; sometimes this was brown, sometimes\r\ngray, sometimes cream-colored. There was nothing original about the\r\nmaterial employed. But afterward--then came the amazing thing! When\r\nthe clay articles were put into the kiln to be fired a quantity of\r\ncommon salt was thrown in with them and this salt created a vapor\r\nwhich when it settled upon the ware fused with it, giving to the clay\r\na coarse, porous-appearing surface."\r\n\r\n"How do you suppose anybody ever thought of using salt?" inquired\r\nTheo.\r\n\r\n"I do not know. Probably the discovery, like so many others, was a\r\nmere happen-so. At any rate it was a fortunate happening, for\r\nimmediately this method of glazing earthenware was carried to England,\r\nwhere Doulton of Lambeth began manufacturing some very beautiful\r\ngres. For gres can be of exquisite beauty as well as of most ordinary\r\ntype. Do not forget that. The term serves to cover those opaque\r\nearthenwares which are fired until vitrification or an external\r\nglassing results. At first all styles of gres were called Gres de\r\nFlandres, but later the single term gres was given them. You will\r\nhardly be surprised when I tell you that those past masters in the art\r\nof every kind of pottery-making, the Chinese and Japanese, have given\r\nus our finest specimens of gres, some of them having designs of\r\nimitation jewels upon them; and others decorations of beautifully\r\ncolored enamels. Next to these Oriental varieties Germany has always\r\nexcelled in the making of gres. There is a great scope for artistic\r\nexpression in this ware, a far broader range for merit than in many\r\nothers."\r\n\r\n"So it was this salt glaze that England took up, was it?" ruminated\r\nTheo.\r\n\r\n"Yes. You see, up to this time very little glazed ware had been made\r\nin England, for until the Dutch traders came with their Chinese and\r\nDelft wares the English had been cheerfully using, as I told you,\r\nunglazed clay, wood, pewter, and on rare occasions silver dishes. Even\r\nthe ladies of Queen Elizabeth\'s household felt no shame to eat from\r\nwooden dishes. As for knives and forks--nobody used those! Every one\r\nate with his fingers. Think how primitive it must have been to go to a\r\nbanquet of the Lord-Mayor of London arrayed in your silk or velvet\r\ncostume, and eat roasted ox with your fingers from a trencher, or\r\nsquare slab of wood! Yet such a procedure was considered entirely\r\nproper in those days."\r\n\r\nTheo was much amused.\r\n\r\n"Afterward for quite a long time dishes of brown stoneware were in\r\nvogue; and then as an improvement on those came a coarse\r\ngreenish-yellow type of ware. It was about 1645 that into England\r\nstrayed a few Dutch potters who began to make a reproduction of Delft\r\npottery. In the meantime in quite another part of the country a\r\nsalt-glazed stoneware of far better quality than any previously\r\nmanufactured made its appearance. To this the name _porcellane_ was\r\ngiven, and although the product was in reality simply a gres the fact\r\nis interesting because it is the first time that we have the word\r\napplied to china. It probably came from the Italian noun _porcellana_,\r\nmeaning a shell, which the thinness of the new ware may have\r\nsuggested; or the term may have been derived from the French word\r\n_pourcelaine_, a word used for any material from which a sculptor\r\nmodels his statues. We are not certain which of these theories is\r\ncorrect. Nevertheless we have the name, although at this particular\r\ndate it was incorrectly applied."\r\n\r\n"But the English had nothing at that time but pottery to give the name\r\nto," objected Theo.\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden chuckled.\r\n\r\n"Exactly! So they shouldn\'t have used the term at all," he said,\r\n"because they have confused a lot of good people since then. From this\r\nperiod on England went steadily forward with its china-making.\r\nEarthenware of various kinds covered with salt glaze were made at\r\nFulham, Stoke-on-Trent, and Staffordshire. It was about 1750 that the\r\nsecond of the great potters made his advent."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" cried Theo, "now we are going to hear who he was!"\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden paused a moment as if thinking just how he should best\r\ntell the story. Then he began:\r\n\r\n"The name of this second pottery-maker to whom the world owes a mighty\r\ndebt was Josiah Wedgwood. He was a man who came naturally by his skill\r\nat pottery-making, for, not only was he himself a potter, but he also\r\nhad several ancestors who had followed the trade. He was a\r\nconscientious workman of limited education, but a person to whom a\r\nthorough, careful piece of work, done as well as it was possible to do\r\nit, was a satisfaction and delight. Remember that fact, for it had\r\nmuch to do with Wedgwood\'s subsequent success. He also loved beauty\r\nof form, and probably had he been able to choose he would have turned\r\nhis entire attention to making a classic type of pottery. But being\r\none of thirteen children he was poor, and his common sense told him\r\nthat there were far more necessary things to be done in the world than\r\nto give all one\'s time to articles that were not useful. So he put his\r\ndream behind him, like the practical fellow he was, and looked about\r\nto see what his contemporaries needed, and what he could do to aid his\r\ngeneration."\r\n\r\n"I should think that if he could have made some dishes it would have\r\nhelped as much as anything," asserted Theo emphatically.\r\n\r\n"That was precisely what he decided," answered\r\nMr. Croyden. "Accordingly he went to work to apply his knowledge of\r\npottery to the improvement of English earthenware. First he made a\r\nkind of cream-white pottery which he dubbed Queen\'s Ware in honor of\r\nQueen Charlotte; and which in spite of the fact that it boasted no\r\ndecoration, became very popular in England because of its moderate\r\nprice. From this simple beginning Wedgwood got money to experiment\r\nfurther, and work out other varieties of china. In 1773 he began his\r\nfamous dinner-set for Empress Catherine II of Russia, which had upon\r\nit over twelve hundred enameled views of English estates, and for\r\nwhich she paid three thousand pounds. For two months before this set\r\nwas packed and sent away it was on exhibition in London, where it was\r\nthe marvel of every one who saw it."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to have seen it!" interjected Theo.\r\n\r\n"And I too," echoed Mr. Croyden. "By this time Wedgwood had money\r\nenough to carry out some of his dreams. He was fortunate in having the\r\nfriendship of several Englishmen of wealth and through one of them,\r\nSir William Hamilton, he obtained a chance to take impressions of rare\r\ncameos from Italy and Pompeii; later the Duke of Portland, who you may\r\nrecall outbid him at the sale of the world-famed Portland Vase,\r\nallowed him to copy it. It was a very generous thing for an art-lover\r\nto do, and I think it must have cost the duke a wrench. It took\r\nWedgwood a whole year to copy this vase, and when he had succeeded in\r\ndoing so he made fifty more copies. The venture cost him not only his\r\ntime but a small fortune as well; but it proved far from a waste of\r\nhours or money, since the feat brought to the manufacturer a\r\nfamiliarity with Grecian art which had its outcome in his well-known\r\nJasper ware."\r\n\r\nTheo glanced up questioningly.\r\n\r\n"Surely you have seen this ware, Theo," asserted Mr. Croyden. "It\r\ncomes in blue sage-green, or purple, and has upon it Grecian figures\r\nin white."\r\n\r\nInstantly a flash of recognition came into Theo\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know it now!" he ejaculated. "Mother has a teapot of it at\r\nhome."\r\n\r\n"That is more than likely," came cordially from Mr. Croyden. "At\r\nfirst, however, Wedgwood did not put the white figures on this ware;\r\nhe merely mixed the coloring matter with the clay and got as a result\r\na dull, opaque ware of green. Afterward he conceived the idea of\r\nmaking the pottery in other colors and decorating it with the Grecian,\r\nItalian, or Roman figures of which he had long before taken\r\nimpressions. As this venture took form sculptors became interested in\r\nthe project and lent their aid, so that by and by an entirely original\r\nware was developed which has come down through history as one of the\r\nsignificant art contributions of the age. In addition to his Queen\'s\r\nware, and Jasper ware, Wedgwood also made a black Egyptian-like ware\r\ncalled Basalt; another variety of cream-colored ware known as Bamboo;\r\nand a kind of terra-cotta that imitated granite."\r\n\r\n"Well, I should certainly think Wedgwood did his bit!" declared Theo.\r\n\r\n"Ah, but this was not all he did," retorted Mr. Croyden quickly. "His\r\nmost important work I have not yet mentioned."\r\n\r\n"What was that?"\r\n\r\n"He invented two things of widely different nature which have been of\r\nthe greatest practical value to our civilization ever since. One was a\r\nhard biscuit porcelain such as is used in laboratories, and for\r\nchemist\'s and pharmacist\'s utensils. This meant far greater\r\nconvenience in the mixing and preparation of drugs and medicines."\r\n\r\n"And the other?"\r\n\r\n"The other was the glazing of common earthenware or terra-cotta\r\ndrain-pipes. This non-\xc3\xa6sthetic product was perhaps Wedgwood\'s greatest\r\ncontribution to his time, for it revolutionized sanitation, and was a\r\nmighty step toward better living conditions. Surely no one can say\r\nthat Josiah Wedgwood did not let his art serve his generation both\r\nfrom an artistic and a practical standpoint."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPORCELAIN AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress toward health now became quite rapid, for Theo, being a\r\nnormal boy, the injured bone knit quickly, and before long Dr. Swift\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"I have sent for some crutches for you, son, and as soon as they come\r\nI see no reason why you should not be up and about. Of course you\r\ncannot expect to go hiking off over these rough trails; but you can\r\ncertainly get out of bed and move about the camp."\r\n\r\nTheo\'s eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n"My, but won\'t it seem good!" he sighed.\r\n\r\n"I am sure it will," answered the Doctor. "You have been very\r\npatient, Theo."\r\n\r\n"Going to get the invalid up, Doctor?" questioned Mr. Croyden, who had\r\njust poked his head in at the door.\r\n\r\n"Yes, just as soon as the crutches I have ordered from New York\r\narrive."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden looked rueful.\r\n\r\n"That means I shall be losing my lecture audience," he mourned\r\nplayfully. "You will no longer be a spoiled child, Theo, after those\r\ncrutches come. We shan\'t serve all your meals in your room, nor give\r\nyou the biggest fish in the catch. You will have to come down to\r\ncommon fare like the rest of us."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t find me doing any fussing on that score," laughed Theo. "As\r\nfor the lectures--why, I have a season ticket, and shall expect a\r\nlecture every day."\r\n\r\n"Mercy on us!" gasped Mr. Croyden. "Do you realize, young man, that I\r\ncame into these woods to rest? If I am to make pottery and porcelain\r\nwith you every day I might just as well be at home."\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was plain that the elder man was pleased.\r\n\r\n"Well, so long as you have secured a season ticket in advance I\r\nsuppose there is no help for it," he added with a comic expression of\r\nresignation. "When, by the by, does the next lecture come?"\r\n\r\nTheo pretended to produce an imaginary ticket from his pocket and\r\nconsult it.\r\n\r\n"The next lecture seems to be listed for this evening just after\r\ndinner," he replied gravely.\r\n\r\n"It does, does it!" exclaimed Mr. Croyden. "Very well; the lecturer\r\nwill be ready at seven sharp. I make it a point never to disappoint an\r\naudience."\r\n\r\nWith a good-natured laugh he was gone.\r\n\r\n"I hope I don\'t bother Mr. Croyden too much, Father," observed Theo\r\nreflectively, after the older man was out of hearing.\r\n\r\n"I guess you don\'t," answered the Doctor. "At first I was afraid you\r\nmight be taking too much of his time, so I asked him; but I soon found\r\nhe enjoyed these talks quite as much as you. He is a good talker, and\r\nlike the rest of us finds it pleasant to discuss his hobby. I begged\r\nhim to be frank and tell you whenever he was too tired or busy to\r\ntalk, and he promised he would."\r\n\r\n"He has been mighty good to me."\r\n\r\n"He certainly has," agreed Dr. Swift. "He likes boys very much. It is\r\na pity he has no son of his own."\r\n\r\n"It is a shame!" exclaimed Theo. "He would make such a splendid father\r\nfor some boy."\r\n\r\nDr. Swift nodded.\r\n\r\n"Boys are of course a great nuisance, and they make us lots of\r\ntrouble," he remarked dryly, "but they are good things to have in the\r\nhouse in spite of that."\r\n\r\nAs he rose to go he cast a whimsical glance at his son.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll leave you this book to read," he said. "Mother sent it. And\r\nhere are some letters. Here, too, is a picture puzzle which looks as\r\nif it might keep you busy for some time. I guess you won\'t be idle\r\nbefore I get back."\r\n\r\nTheo met his eye with a bright smile.\r\n\r\n"I guess I won\'t have a chance to be," he replied.\r\n\r\nThe book proved to be an aeroplane story of just the kind Theo liked;\r\nand the puzzle was so hard that he worked on it at intervals most of\r\nthe day. Then came twilight and with it a game of cribbage with his\r\nfather, after which he had a deliciously cooked dinner of fried perch,\r\nbrowned potatoes, and a marvelous three-story chocolate pie, a\r\nmasterpiece of Franz\'s cookery.\r\n\r\n"I think this has been about the best day yet," Theo remarked when\r\npromptly at seven Mr. Croyden drew his chair up into the firelight.\r\n"Father does plan such jolly things for me to do! And you, and Manuel,\r\nand Franz are so kind!"\r\n\r\n"Those of us who have our legs ought to be, that\'s sure," was\r\nMr. Croyden\'s grim response. "It is the least we can do. In my\r\nopinion you have been a real hero, Theo. If my leg had been broken I\r\nshould never have been so patient. You would have seen me storming\r\nround like a caged tiger. In fact I doubt even if lectures delivered\r\nby such a brilliant speaker as myself would have kept me still."\r\n\r\nTheo chuckled.\r\n\r\n"What is the subject of the lecture you are to give this evening?" he\r\ninquired with mock seriousness.\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t it printed on your ticket?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"No?" exclaimed Mr. Croyden in surprise. "A great oversight! The man\r\nwho printed these tickets is a stupid fellow. I believe I shall have\r\nto discharge him and try somebody else. The subject of this evening\'s\r\nlecture is, of course, _Porcelain_."\r\n\r\n"Porcelain! Have we really come to porcelain at last!" cried Theo,\r\nmuch delighted.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we have now finished with the potteries and earthenwares--at\r\nleast for the present, and we shall begin on porcelain, the great\r\nart-work of the Chinese."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden stopped to cram tobacco into his pipe.\r\n\r\n"Already I have told you that the Chinese made beautiful porcelains\r\nfrom kaolin and petuntse, two clays which produced a hard,\r\nsemi-transparent china," he began. "And I have also told you how for a\r\nlong time they were the only nation to have a knowledge of the\r\nnecessary ingredients for such a ware. I only wish I had here at this\r\nmoment some specimens of the exquisite porcelains they have made that\r\nyou might see them and get some idea of their richness and beauty. It\r\nis difficult to describe them in words."\r\n\r\n"Maybe when we go home Father will take me to the Metropolitan Museum\r\nto see some Chinese porcelains," suggested Theo.\r\n\r\n"I am sure he will," Mr. Croyden said. "And if he is too busy to do\r\nit, I will take you myself. Maybe some day we could go china-hunting\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"That would be corking!"\r\n\r\n"I\'d enjoy it as much as you," affirmed Mr. Croyden. "We would prowl\r\naround among the different collections and look for the celebrated\r\nNankin blue which, although not strictly speaking a porcelain,\r\nwould give you a glimpse of some of the finest work ever done in a\r\nblue and white ware. Of the very early Chinese porcelains we should,\r\nalas, find no specimens, because most of these were destroyed during\r\nthe wars that raged against the various ancient dynasties; but we\r\nshould see some examples of what is called the Chrysanthemo-P\xc3\xa6onienne\r\nperiod."\r\n\r\n"Jove, what a name!"\r\n\r\n"Not such a terrible one when you think about it," returned\r\nMr. Croyden. "Get to work with your brain and you can soon tell me\r\nwhat it means."\r\n\r\n"Chrysanthe----" ruminated Theo, thinking aloud. "Has it anything to\r\ndo with chrysanthemum?"\r\n\r\n"It surely has. Go on," urged the elder man encouragingly.\r\n\r\n"P\xc3\xa6onienne--I\'ll bet it is another flower! Peony?"\r\n\r\n"There you have it!" came triumphantly from the china\r\nmanufacturer. "It was not half as bad as it sounded, you\r\nsee. Chrysanthemums and peonies--the two flowers almost exclusively\r\nused as decoration on the porcelain of that particular period. So\r\nuniversally was one or the other of these flowers employed, and so\r\nindividual was their treatment, that the name serves to cover one of\r\nthe oldest types of Chinese porcelain remaining to us. This porcelain\r\nwas not so beautiful, however, as some of that which follows it; the\r\nclay or body of the ware being less fine. One can easily see that at\r\nthat time the Chinese had not perfected their art. Nevertheless it is\r\nremarkable, and the flower designs on it most artistic."\r\n\r\n"And what came next?" inquired Theo.\r\n\r\n"Next we come to some other varieties of porcelains which connoisseurs\r\nhave grouped together because of their color and called\r\n_Famille-vert_. Think out what that name means as you did the\r\nother. You have studied French at school, haven\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"A little," replied Theo modestly. "_Famille_ is family; and I think\r\n_vert_ is green. But of course it could not mean Green Family."\r\n\r\n"That is precisely what it does mean," Mr. Croyden returned\r\nheartily. "The name refers to the delicate color of the ware. \'Sky\r\nafter a summer rain\' was what the Chinese sometimes poetically called\r\nit. It is a porcelain of wonderful rarity and beauty. Some of it even\r\nranges to as deep hue as apple-green. One does not find much of it\r\nnow, for it is a very choice and expensive variety; nor was it widely\r\nmade. The ware for which the Chinese were most celebrated was the\r\n_Famille-rose_."\r\n\r\n"Rose Family!" exclaimed Theo, instantly.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Broadly speaking the Red Family. I am glad to see you have your\r\nFrench so at your tongue\'s end. This porcelain of the Rose Family was\r\nthe masterpiece of the Chinese. The word rose did not in this case\r\nrefer to the flower but to the rich red tone of the porcelain. Some of\r\nit is as deep and almost as brilliant as a ruby; and neither its\r\ndecoration nor its coloring can be surpassed. For the Chinese, you\r\nmust not forget, were the most original and unhampered of artists.\r\nThey were never content to copy flowers, faces, or figures as we do\r\nto-day. Instead they aimed to catch the spirit of the object from\r\nwhich they were working, and then with freedom and boldness to execute\r\na design that should have something more than mere reproduction in\r\nit. It did not matter in the least to them if a flower in one of their\r\npictures was sometimes larger than a man; or a boat many sizes bigger\r\nthan the bridge beneath which it sailed. They were making a sort of\r\nfairyland decoration where anything they pleased was possible; it was\r\nnot a world of fact. As a result they got an imaginative quality in\r\ntheir decoration which none of our more prosaic and literal western\r\nnations have ever equaled."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden took a pull at his pipe.\r\n\r\n"Much of their design was symbolic, and much of the coloring they used\r\nhad a national significance. For example, the Dragon was a symbol of\r\nempire and power; the Dog, a sacred animal, was often used; but it was\r\nno ordinary dog. Instead it had great teeth, a curling mane, and claws\r\nlike a lion. A Chinese artist would have scorned to copy a real dog,\r\nfor that would not have been considered art; nor would a picture of\r\nany living type of dog be half as imposing as was this imaginary\r\ncreature with its fierce teeth, mane, and claws. Sometimes the\r\n_Kylin_, a sort of stag with a dragon\'s head, and a symbol of\r\ngood-fortune, was used. There were many other of these symbolic\r\ndesigns employed to enhance the beauty of Chinese porcelains, and of\r\ncourse to the Chinese each one had its meaning."\r\n\r\n"It is an interesting idea, isn\'t it?" Theo said slowly.\r\n\r\n"Very; and makes much of our own art seem pitifully thin. And when you\r\nconsider that the colors the Chinese used also had their meaning, as\r\ndid various geometric forms introduced, you can readily see how much\r\none must study to understand Chinese--and for that matter, Japanese\r\nart; for the Japanese used much the same methods in decorating their\r\npotteries and porcelains, although of course their symbolism\r\nvaried. With the Chinese green and vermilion were colors sacred to the\r\nwall decorations of Emperors\' houses; red typified fire; black, water;\r\ngreen, wood; white, metal. Fire was also sometimes represented by a\r\ncircle, and the earth by a square. All this I tell you that you may\r\nsee how much thought went into everything they did. In addition\r\ncertain objects were made for especial purposes, and decorated in\r\naccordance with their use. There were drinking cups for poets,\r\nauthors, and government officials, each cup having an appropriate\r\npicture in the bottom. Then there were incense-burners, vases, bowls,\r\nand vessels for libations at ceremonials; there were, too, statues of\r\nthe various gods. Besides these many types of workmanship the Chinese\r\nmade a very thin egg-shell porcelain, the most fragile and transparent\r\nof which we now get from Japan; and a porcelain decorated with a fine,\r\nopen-work design cut through the ware, and styled \'grains-of-rice\r\npattern.\' Moreover they manufactured a variety which in firing took on\r\na crackled effect and has for that reason been christened Chinese\r\nCrackle. You see how many kinds of thing they worked out."\r\n\r\n"I should say so!" exclaimed Theo.\r\n\r\n"Most of the painting of Chinese porcelain was done directly on the\r\nglaze instead of underneath it, although some of the brush work was\r\ndone on the clay itself before the glaze was put over it. In either\r\ncase the ware required several firings, and before even such a simple\r\narticle as a cup was completed it frequently passed through as many as\r\nseventy pairs of hands. Add to this the dangers risked in packing and\r\nimporting, and the tumult of the many wars that racked China, and is\r\nit anything short of a marvel that so many perfect pieces of ancient\r\nmake have come down to us?"\r\n\r\n"I think it is wonderful that all of them were not broken," gasped\r\nTheo.\r\n\r\n"It is not until 1171 that there is any mention of porcelain being\r\nseen outside of China. Then the Mohammedan Saladin sent as a present\r\nto another ruler forty pieces of Chinese porcelain. In 1487 the Sultan\r\nof Turkey gave to Lorenzo de Medici, a great art lover, a porcelain\r\nvase. After that porcelain began, as I have already told you, to find\r\nits way into Europe--first through the Portuguese traders, and later\r\nthrough the Dutch. What we know of Chinese porcelain applies largely\r\nto that of Japan, because for many years Japan was merely an imitator\r\nof China so far as porcelain-making was concerned. By and by, however,\r\nthe Japanese Government encouraged the industry by giving money toward\r\nits manufacture, and as a result about the year 1200 the porcelains of\r\nthe Japanese rivaled those of China. The Chrysanthemo-P\xc3\xa6onienne was\r\nworked out to a degree of perfection hitherto unknown; and the\r\nFamille-rose was also made, but not as perfectly as in China. The\r\nFamille-vert, on the contrary, was not attempted to any extent in\r\nJapan, probably because the Japanese lacked the necessary clays to\r\nmake it."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden paused as if reflecting, then added:\r\n\r\n"As I explained to you, the Japanese had their symbolism of color and\r\ndesign as well as the Chinese; and not only did they make similar\r\nsorts of porcelain, but they subsequently invented styles of\r\ndecoration of their own. They did much medallion-painting, a form of\r\ndesign unknown in China. They also gave to the world their wonderful\r\nJapanese lacquer, a varnish of gums that could be applied not only to\r\nwood but in some cases to porcelain. They also were the race to invent\r\nCloisonn\xc3\xa9 ware, a very difficult type of thing when made as they made\r\nit. To the surface of the porcelain they fastened a tiny metal outline\r\nof the design and afterward filled in the spaces between it with\r\ncolored enamels. You can easily see what careful workmanship such a\r\nprocess required."\r\n\r\n"We have a Cloisonn\xc3\xa9 vase at home," said Theo soberly, "but I never\r\nknew it was made that way."\r\n\r\n"If it is the genuine old Japanese Cloisonn\xc3\xa9 it was," answered\r\nMr. Croyden. "The Japanese also gave us the Mandarin china so highly\r\nprized by collectors. This is an interesting ware because on it we\r\nfind the tiny Mandarins pictured in the decoration, wearing their\r\nlittle toques or caps topped with the button denoting their rank. You\r\nsee when the Thsing victors conquered the Ming Dynasty of China they\r\ndecreed that many of the old Chinese customs and modes of dress should\r\ngive place to those of Japan. Among other things they ordered that\r\nofficials wear the toque or mandarin-cap. The Chinese were, as you can\r\nwell imagine, very angry; and although they wore the cap you see no\r\nlittle mandarins thus arrayed adorning their porcelain. But the\r\nJapanese not only immortalized these reminders of their supremacy on\r\ntheir chinaware, but they even took some of their mandarin-decorated\r\nporcelain to China and forced the Chinese to buy it. In most\r\ncollections you will find some of this Mandarin china; but remember,\r\nalthough it may have come from China, it probably was not made there."\r\n\r\nTheo smiled.\r\n\r\n"The Japanese came in time to be great traders," continued\r\nMr. Croyden, "and they are going to be still greater ones some\r\nday. They invented many other kinds of pottery and porcelain which\r\nthey sold to the merchants of Holland. Satsuma is a pottery in which\r\nthey excelled. It has a body of cream-colored earthenware not unlike\r\nWedgwood\'s Queen\'s ware, and this is richly decorated in dull colors\r\nand gold. In order to please the Dutch traders the Japanese even\r\npainted angels, saints, and other Christian figures both on their\r\npottery and porcelain, which proves they must have been pretty eager\r\nfor European customers. At the present moment they are equally willing\r\nto cater to American and European demands, and to gratify our\r\ninartistic public by sending into our markets all sorts of cheap,\r\ngaudily decorated goods which they themselves would not tolerate. It\r\nis a deplorable fact, too, that we buy them. Now you surely have got\r\nyour money\'s worth of lecture for to-night. If you are not tired, I\r\nam. Good-night, sonny!"\r\n\r\n"Good-night," called Theo as Mr. Croyden passed out, "and thank\r\nyou. I\'m sorry you\'re tired. I am _not_. I could listen all over\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD FAMOUS POTTER\r\n\r\n\r\nTheo\'s crutches did not arrive as soon as he expected, both because of\r\nthe remoteness of the camp and a confusion in transportation.\r\n\r\nPoor Theo! After getting his hopes up it was hard to be cheerful over\r\nthis disappointment, and the courage that until now had buoyed him up\r\nsuddenly began to fail.\r\n\r\n"I just wish one of those miserable expressmen could have a broken leg\r\nand then he\'d see how good it is to be laid up like this," fretted the\r\nboy indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come, don\'t wish that!" Mr. Croyden protested laughing, "for if\r\nyou decree that the expressmen be disabled you will never get your\r\ncrutches."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not," admitted Theo grudgingly. "But it is so irritating."\r\n\r\n"I know that; still, it might be worse, Theo. You really are pretty\r\ncomfortable, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You are not suffering."\r\n\r\n"No," murmured the lad, hanging his head.\r\n\r\n"You have plenty to eat."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And the food is good."\r\n\r\nTheo flushed, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n"There is many a boy worse off than you are."\r\n\r\n"Probably."\r\n\r\n"I guess your father could show you a score of them were you to\r\naccompany him on one of his hospital rounds. Suppose, for example, you\r\nwere in pain every moment, and were never to walk again. That would be\r\na real calamity, and something to fuss about."\r\n\r\nTheo raised his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I know it, sir," he said instantly. "I\'m afraid I have been pretty\r\ngrumpy and cross."\r\n\r\n"No. Until now you have been most patient--phenomenally patient for a\r\nlad who loves to be doing something every minute. It is precisely\r\nbecause you have done so well that I\'d like you to hold out a little\r\nlonger."\r\n\r\nTheo\'s lip quivered; then suddenly his scowl melted into a mischievous\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"I believe, Mr. Croyden, that you are as good at preaching as you are\r\nat lecturing," he observed gaily.\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden nodded his head.\r\n\r\n"You are one of the few persons, Theo, who appreciate me at my full\r\nvalue. I am really a very gifted person if only other people suspected\r\nit. In return for your recognition of my talents I have half a mind to\r\nfavor you with another of my celebrated lectures this very instant."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would," came eagerly from Theo. "But aren\'t you going off\r\nfishing this morning?"\r\n\r\n"No. Your father and Manuel are going to fish some secret trout hole,\r\nand they did not invite me. You see, your father\'s guide and mine are\r\nthe best of friends until it comes to trout holes; then they are sworn\r\nenemies. Manuel won\'t tell Tony where he finds his five and six\r\npounders; and Tony won\'t tell Manuel. Yesterday Tony actually led me\r\nnearly half a mile out of my way so Manuel should not see where we\r\nwere going. He wanted to throw him off the scent, and I guess he did\r\nit, too. This rivalry between fishing guides is very common and\r\nsometimes, I am sorry to say, it is less good-natured than here."\r\n\r\n"It seems very silly," Theo remarked.\r\n\r\n"It is the same old question of protecting the source of one\'s\r\nincome. Governments as well as individuals have to confront the\r\nproblem. You remember how the Chinese tried to shut every one out from\r\nknowing how they made their porcelain?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. And you never have told me yet how the European nations\r\nfound out the secret."\r\n\r\n"Until now we had not come to that story," replied Mr. Croyden. "But\r\nto-day it chances that that is the very tale I have in mind to tell\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nTheo rubbed his hands, and with a contented smile settled back against\r\nthe pillows prepared to listen.\r\n\r\n"As I told you," began Mr. Croyden, "about 1518 Portuguese traders\r\nbrought Chinese porcelains into Europe; and following their lead the\r\nDutch imported the same goods in even greater quantities. Everywhere\r\npeople marveled at the beauty of these wares just as you would have\r\ndone if up to that time you had never seen anything but crude clay\r\ndishes. The whiteness of the porcelain seemed a miracle, and on every\r\nhand people were eager to make such china themselves. Especially\r\neager were the rulers of the different European countries, who were\r\nclever enough to see that such production would greatly increase their\r\nnational fame and prosperity. Now there chanced to be a Prussian by\r\nthe name of B\xc3\xb6ttger, an alchemist, who because of the wars had fled\r\nfor safety to Meissen. He was a man well-versed in the composition of\r\nminerals and chemicals, and in consequence Augustus II, who was at\r\nthat time Elector of Saxony, sent for him, and asked him to join his\r\nother skilled chemists, who for a long time had been busy\r\nexperimenting with clays in the hope of discovering how the Chinese\r\nmade their porcelain. This was no unusual thing, for chemists of most\r\nof the other countries were working feverishly in their laboratories\r\nat the same enigma."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t it seem funny?"\r\n\r\n"As you look back on it, yes," answered Mr. Croyden. "It is almost\r\ntragic when you consider the time, patience, and money that went into\r\nthese experiments--most of them failures, at that."\r\n\r\n"Did B\xc3\xb6ttger fail too?"\r\n\r\n"I am coming to that," replied the story-teller. "While mixing\r\nvarious combinations of clays B\xc3\xb6ttger and his associates came upon a\r\nhard pottery clay which was neither white nor translucent like the\r\nChinese, but which nevertheless was nearer that ware than anything\r\nthey had previously succeeded in making. In 1708 some dishes were\r\nmade from this material, but they were not very satisfactory. After\r\nthat B\xc3\xb6ttger tried again. You see he was not a person who was easily\r\ndiscouraged. The next time he got a white ware, but it was not thin;\r\ninstead it was thick and ugly. He now had the hardness and the\r\nwhiteness, but not the semi-transparency and fine texture of the\r\nChinese porcelain; and although he tried repeatedly he was unable to\r\nfathom the secret of these qualities."\r\n\r\nTheo waited while Mr. Croyden stopped to rest.\r\n\r\n"The one thing B\xc3\xb6ttger needed he did not know where to find and that\r\nwas----"\r\n\r\n"Kaolin!" cried Theo.\r\n\r\n"Exactly," assented Mr. Croyden. "What a pity it is that you could not\r\nhave shouted the magic word in his ear as lustily as you have in\r\nmine. It would have saved poor B\xc3\xb6ttger no end of worry and hard\r\nwork. However, even if he had heard the name it probably would have\r\nconveyed nothing to him, for no one in Europe had ever heard of\r\nkaolin."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is a Chinese word."\r\n\r\n"Yes. The name was taken from the Chinese mountain of Kailing, where\r\nthe first kaolin, or decomposed feldspar, was found."\r\n\r\n"Now please go on with the story," urged Theo.\r\n\r\n"Well, one day it happened that a rich Saxon iron-master was taking a\r\nride, and as he went along his horse\'s foot stuck in the soft clay at\r\nthe roadside. As the rider glanced down to see what the trouble was he\r\nwas amazed to discover that the clay was white, and being a business\r\nman the thought instantly came into his mind that here was a way to\r\nmake some money. At that time all the nobles of the Court wore\r\npowdered wigs, and the quick-witted iron-master said to himself: \'I\r\nwill get some of this clay, sift it very fine, do it up in packages,\r\nand sell it for powdering the hair; thus I will make my fortune.\'\r\nAccordingly his servants dug some of the clay, and after it had been\r\ncarefully sifted through cloth, he put it upon the market as a new\r\nwig-powder. Now in those days the more well-to-do persons had several\r\nwigs or at least two, in order that while the one was being worn the\r\nother might be sent away to the hair-dresser\'s to be curled and\r\npowdered. Therefore, in the course of time it chanced that B\xc3\xb6ttger\'s\r\nservant, like others, sent away his master\'s wig to have it freshened\r\nup. When it came back it was beautifully dressed and was powdered with\r\nsome of the iron-master\'s new powder. It looked very fine indeed, and\r\nB\xc3\xb6ttger had no fault to find with it until he took it up to put it on\r\nhis head; then he observed that it was strangely heavy. \'What\'s this!\'\r\nhe cried to his servant. \'What have you been doing to my wig, rascal?\'\r\nTerror-stricken the servant protested that he had done nothing.\r\nB\xc3\xb6ttger carried the wig into his laboratory that he might examine it\r\nmore carefully, and he soon came to the conclusion that the weight of\r\nthe article lay in the powder. He therefore shook it off and set to\r\nwork to analyze it. What was his surprise to find the powder a white\r\nmineral substance of which he knew nothing. You may be sure he was not\r\nlong in tracking down the hair-dresser and learning from him where he\r\ngot his new powder. Next he went to the Saxon iron-master and bought\r\nfrom him a great quantity of the stuff, after which the chemist shut\r\nhimself up in his laboratory to try out the new material. Think how\r\nexcited he must have been! And think how much more excited he was when\r\nhe found that this mysterious white clay was the substance for which\r\nhe had so long been searching!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "HIS SERVANTS DUG SOME OF THE CLAY"]\r\n\r\n"Kaolin?" gasped Theo.\r\n\r\n"Kaolin!"\r\n\r\nThe room was very still; then Theo stammered hurriedly:\r\n\r\n"And what happened next?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you can imagine the joy the discovery brought; but it was a\r\ncarefully stifled joy, for with all his delight B\xc3\xb6ttger was far too\r\ndiscreet to allow his wonderful discovery to travel outside the\r\nconfines of his laboratory. When the Elector Augustus was told the\r\nnews at his Dresden palace near by he was wild with delight, and\r\nimmediately began building a great porcelain factory at Meissen. By\r\n1715 there was enough of the new ware ready to be put on sale at\r\nLeipsic; and thus our beautiful porcelain, dubbed Dresden ware in\r\nhonor of the Saxon capitol, came into being. The first that was made\r\nwas plain white with a decoration of vines and leaves in low\r\nrelief. Later some of the dishes were made with a perforated border in\r\nimitation of the Chinese and Japanese \'grains-of-rice\' pattern.\r\nAfterward the potters attempted the use of blue in a vain attempt to\r\nreproduce Nankin Blue ware."\r\n\r\n"I guess the other countries were pretty sore when they found Saxony\r\nhad learned how to make porcelain," put in Theo.\r\n\r\n"They were greatly agitated, my son," laughed Mr. Croyden. "They\r\nbegged, bribed, and schemed to find out what the new clay was; but all\r\nto no purpose. The works at Meissen were guarded day and night, and\r\nevery person employed in the factory was compelled to swear to keep\r\nthe great secret. Men were cautioned they would be shot should they\r\ndivulge the process. _Be secret to Death_ was the motto of the\r\nmanufactory, and that meant not only that they never should tell\r\nanybody all their life-long; but if threatened with harm they should\r\nprefer death to betraying their trust. They must even endure torture\r\nitself rather than open their mouths. Some histories go so far as to\r\nsay that in order to secure absolute secrecy only the deaf and dumb\r\nwere allowed to transport the clay."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see but they were just as selfish as the Chinese."\r\n\r\n"Quite as selfish, alas!"\r\n\r\n"What became of B\xc3\xb6ttger?"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to say he never did much of anything else that was\r\npraiseworthy. Sometimes too much success spoils people. But he had\r\ndone his work, and a great work, too, in launching this vast\r\nindustry. When he died he left behind him a group of thriving\r\nfactories. After his death the artists at the Meissen works gradually\r\nabandoned copying Chinese and Japanese designs and began inventing\r\ndecorations of their own, using both gold and an increasing variety of\r\ncolors. They also began to secure the aid of sculptors, among them the\r\nfamed sculptor K\xc3\xa4ndler who modeled statuettes of saints, animals,\r\nbirds, and persons in much the way the Dutch had done. These figures\r\nor groups, however, were more finely executed, and were beautifully\r\ncolored. As the makers of them became more expert larger figures were\r\nattempted until some of them were life-sized."\r\n\r\n"Goodness!"\r\n\r\n"It does seem absurd, doesn\'t it?" agreed Mr. Croyden. "It is a\r\nchildish impulse to want to make everything as big as one can make it.\r\nNevertheless in a land where much of the population was Catholic you\r\ncan readily understand how these gigantic figures readily found places\r\nupon altars in the churches of Europe. All might have gone well with\r\nthis great porcelain plant had not the Seven Years\' War arisen just at\r\nthis time, lasting from 1756 to 1763. During this period Frederick the\r\nGreat, the grandfather of the present Emperor of Germany, went into\r\nSaxony, stopped the royal factories at Meissen, and took the workmen\r\nas captives to Berlin."\r\n\r\n"But----" began Theo indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Such things are the issues of war," said Mr. Croyden gravely. "We\r\ncannot uphold them, nor cease to deplore their injustice. We can only\r\npray that a day may come when the envy between nations will cease, and\r\nwhen each country shall respect its neighbor\'s rights in a truly\r\nChristian spirit. Then we shall have a world for which we shall not\r\nneed to blush, and which will really be civilized."\r\n\r\n"Did the Saxon workmen have to make Dresden china in Germany?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Works under the patronage of the Emperor were opened at Berlin,\r\nand here porcelain was made, the profits of which went to the Royal\r\nTreasury, the workmen being paid very little indeed. Much of the ware\r\nmanufactured the monarch kept for his own use; and much of it he gave\r\naway whenever he wished to make a fine present to his friends. But so\r\nlavishly did the Saxon potters use the deposits of native clay that\r\nlater the supply became poorer in quality, and as a consequence the\r\nbody of the later Dresden was not so perfect as that made at\r\nMeissen. For this reason collectors set great value on the early\r\nDresden work, that made between 1731 and 1756; also on the figures\r\nmodeled by the sculptor, K\xc3\xa4ndler."\r\n\r\n"Did the works at Berlin continue?" inquired Theo, who had become\r\nabsorbed in the story.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Mr. Croyden. "You see, even before the capital at\r\nDresden was captured by the Germans and the Meissen workmen carried\r\noff, attempts had been made in Prussia to manufacture porcelain from\r\nordinary stone. Several private business concerns as well as various\r\nindividuals had put their money into the enterprise and had even met\r\nwith some success. But this ware was manufactured on no very extended\r\nscale. Now, however, the Emperor was determined that his venture\r\nshould succeed. Not only did he bring to Berlin the workmen and the\r\nclay, but he even sent forth the edict that no Jew in his kingdom\r\nshould marry until he had purchased an entire supply of porcelain from\r\nthe Royal factories. As most of the Jews were rich this law assured\r\ntheir master a wide sale for his product. That they did not wish to\r\nspend all this money for china and resented the order troubled him not\r\nat all. Most of these unlucky Jews bought their expensive porcelain\r\nsets only to sell them afterward to other customers, and thus get them\r\noff their hands. In this way much of the early Berlin Dresden ware\r\nfound its way into Russia, where rich Russian Jews were glad to buy\r\nit. After repeated improvements the Berlin porcelain came in time to\r\nbe as fine as that made originally at Meissen; and not only were the\r\nMeissen works reopened under German patronage, but the State also\r\nestablished another factory at Charlottenberg.\r\n\r\n"Now, do not forget, Theo, that all this early Meissen or Dresden\r\nporcelain, as well as that eventually manufactured at Berlin, was made\r\nfrom hard paste, or a combination of clays resulting in what we call\r\ntrue porcelain. Later on I shall tell you much about soft paste wares,\r\nand about bone china. None of those varieties, however, ranks as real\r\nporcelain. Remember that only the hard paste products are genuine."\r\nMr. Croyden paused a moment, then added: "And while we are speaking\r\nof this period in history you may perhaps be interested to know that\r\nit was a workman who escaped from Meissen into Austria who started in\r\nVienna the art of making porcelain from hard paste."\r\n\r\n"True porcelain," remarked Theo, who had profited by his lesson.\r\n\r\n"Just so, son. Work in porcelain-making had been going on in Austria\r\nsince about 1717; but it had been done in a small way by private\r\nindividuals, who had only small capital to put into it, and who had\r\nmet with little success because the ware they had turned out had been\r\nthick and muddy in appearance. In 1744 the Empress Maria Theresa\r\npurchased these works, and from that time on they began to\r\nprosper. You see, the monarchs of those days could make almost any\r\nindustry a success if they once set out to do so. Not only had they\r\nthe capital to back their undertaking but they could compel their\r\nsubjects to patronize the venture."\r\n\r\nTheo laughed. "I see."\r\n\r\n"Therefore by 1785 the Empress\'s china factory was a very busy place\r\nwhich was supplying with porcelain not only Austria, but also\r\nTurkey. In 1796 Lamprecht, one of the leading animal painters of the\r\nmonarchy, was decorating this ware with wonderful pictures of stags,\r\nhounds, horses, in which work he excelled. But because of the\r\nMohammedan law that no copies of living creatures could be used for\r\ndesigns the Turks refused to purchase these dishes. Hence Vienna,\r\neager to retain the Oriental trade, was forced to change its artistic\r\ntrend and make instead porcelains adorned with arabesques and\r\ngeometrical figures. At the present time," concluded Mr. Croyden,\r\n"there are extensive pottery and porcelain factories throughout\r\nGermany and Austria-Hungary, and much of our finest ware comes from\r\nthese countries. Were you to study history you would find that many of\r\nthese factories sprang up from small beginnings, and that amid the\r\nturmoil of European strife they had a stiff fight for existence."\r\n\r\n"I think I never considered before the effect of war upon anything but\r\npersons," remarked Theo musingly.\r\n\r\n"Alas, the destruction war wages against human life is bad enough,"\r\nanswered Mr. Croyden. "But see, too, how it retards the arts and\r\nindustries of the world. May the day be not far distant when nations\r\nshall find a more Christian and intelligent method of settling their\r\ndifferences, and when wars shall cease forevermore!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF FRENCH CHINA-MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day when Mr. Croyden put his head in at Theo\'s door to say\r\ngood-morning he found the boy sitting up in bed eating his breakfast\r\nand his first remark was:\r\n\r\n"How long did it take France to find out how to make porcelain,\r\nMr. Croyden?"\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer laughed.\r\n\r\n"I declare if you are not beginning this morning just where you left\r\noff last night!" he exclaimed. "What kind of porcelain do you mean,\r\nhard or soft paste?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, any kind."\r\n\r\n"You have not forgotten the vast difference between the hard and\r\nsoft ware, have you? I should be discouraged if you had."\r\n\r\nTheo shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe you would let me forget even if I wanted to," he\r\nreplied with an impish chuckle.\r\n\r\n"I certainly shouldn\'t," smiled Mr. Croyden. Then he added more\r\nseriously: "Soft paste china, or p\xc3\xa2te tendre, as it is called, was\r\nmade at St. Cloud as early as 1695, and some of it was very\r\nbeautiful. Such ware looks more creamy and is not so cold and harsh to\r\nthe touch. It is, however, much more fragile and for that reason,\r\nalthough a great deal of it was manufactured, the industry never\r\nbecame a wide-spread success. Later soft paste was also made at\r\nChantilly, Vincennes, Limoges, Paris, and a number of French\r\ncities. Even the celebrated S\xc3\xa8vres ware, the finest thing in\r\nchina-making that France ever produced, was at first made from soft\r\npaste. This is easily understood when you recall that at the beginning\r\nthe only clays the French knew anything about were p\xc3\xa2te tendre\r\nclays. It was not until kaolin was discovered in 1765 and taken from\r\nthe section about St. Yrieix that hard paste, or p\xc3\xa2te dure, was\r\nmade in France."\r\n\r\n"I see."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless the French people got wonderful results from their p\xc3\xa2te\r\ntendre, and became wildly enthusiastic over the pieces the\r\nchina-designers turned out. And well they might for the French were an\r\ninventive, art-loving people who certainly got fine results from their\r\nearly china-making. To understand the place art occupied at that time\r\nyou must remember that the Court was a centre for all those who were\r\ninterested in beautiful things. The King was ever on the lookout for\r\nwhat was novel or artistic, and ready to give it his patronage; and\r\nwhatever the King patronized became the fad among the rich, idle\r\ncourtiers. So when the King turned his attention to the new art of\r\nchina-making its success was assured; as a matter of course all the\r\nrest of the fashionable world did the same."\r\n\r\n"It was a good fashion."\r\n\r\n"A very good fashion. Often a monarch\'s patronage of arts and letters\r\ncalled public attention to a praiseworthy production that might\r\notherwise live unrecognized for years. I sometimes think that in our\r\nday it would be a fortunate custom if more persons of influence would\r\ngive thought and money to elevating the arts to their rightful\r\nposition of dignity. The old custom of placing artists and scientists\r\nbeyond the stress of financial worry is not a bad one. Such persons\r\nare benefactors of the race and should be endowed that they may work\r\nmore freely. That is practically what the kings and emperors of the\r\npast did for some of our great writers, artists, and inventors. That\r\nis in reality what King Louis did for the newly-born china-industry.\r\nWhen between 1740 and 1750 a company was formed at Vincennes to make\r\np\xc3\xa2te tendre, the King himself contributed to the venture 100,000\r\nlivres for its encouragment."\r\n\r\n"How splendid!"\r\n\r\n"It meant prosperity for France if the undertaking succeeded, so the\r\nact was not perhaps as unselfish as it seems; however, such a donation\r\nwas of course a great spur to the workmen, who immediately began\r\nmaking not only dinner-sets and ordinary dishes but all sorts of\r\nfantastic and beautiful things. They fashioned colored statuettes,\r\nvases of fanciful pattern, and an abundance of most exquisitely\r\nmodeled flowers. How such fragile products as these latter could be\r\nfired without injury was a marvel. Among other presents which the\r\nchina-makers gave to the Queen was a vase three feet in height\r\ncontaining a bouquet of four hundred and eighty of these flowers, each\r\none carefully copied from nature. These china flowers promptly became\r\nthe rage. Two bouquets of them, each costing 3,000 livres, were made\r\nfor the King and the Dauphin; and these remain to this day in one of\r\nthe French museums. The work of this period all reflects the\r\nnation-wide enthusiasm for these china flowers. Statuettes were made\r\nwith a central figure surrounded by them; there were shepherds and\r\nshepherdesses seated beneath arbors or trellises covered with the\r\ndaintiest of vines and blossoms; figures of court ladies at whose feet\r\nmasses of lovely flowers seemed growing. You can see some of this work\r\nin our own museums, and I am sure you will agree with me that it is\r\nlittle short of miraculous. The Art Museum at Boston has three very\r\nfine specimens of these early French ornaments, and there are others\r\nto be found elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"I am going to hunt some of them up when I go home to the city,"\r\naffirmed Theo.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right! See all you can of the beautiful things the past has\r\ngiven us; you never will be sorry," declared Mr. Croyden. "Now you can\r\nimagine with a background of such progress at china-making, what a\r\nfurore and transformation followed when kaolin was discovered. P\xc3\xa2te\r\ndure was far more desirable than p\xc3\xa2te tendre, for it was much less\r\nbreakable. The works at Vincennes where S\xc3\xa8vres china really had its\r\nbirth were now moved to S\xc3\xa8vres itself, where the art of\r\nporcelain-making was gradually perfected. The plant was not far from\r\nVersailles, where the Royal palace was, and the industry immediately\r\ncame under the control of the King.\r\n\r\n"Then there was excitement indeed! Money was poured in lavishly that\r\nthe infant venture might have every chance to grow. The King ordered\r\nbeautiful gardens to be made about the factories, and not a week\r\npassed that he and Madame de Pompadour did not visit the works\r\naccompanied by a train of nobles and ladies of the Court. Madame de\r\nPompadour, herself something of an artist, often touched up the\r\ndecoration on a bit of china that pleased her fancy. Professional\r\nartists also lent their aid, their designs ranging from the\r\nshepherdesses of Watteau to copies of Chinese and Japanese\r\nscenes. Flowers, cupids, garlands, landscapes--never was such a\r\ndiversity of decoration attempted as during the reigns of Louis XIV\r\nand XV. As a result the output became very overdone and\r\nornate. Fortunately for art, Louis XVI had better taste. Instead of\r\ncontinuing this garish type of design he procured a collection of\r\nGreek vases to serve as models for his workmen, and as a result the\r\nproduct came back to a more classic and less florid style."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden paused.\r\n\r\n"With all this beauty in the body of the porcelain itself, and all\r\nthe wonder of the modeling and painting, you must remember that\r\nthroughout the period the chemists employed were making great strides\r\nin the use of pigments. No little science was necessary to find colors\r\nthat would stand the intense heat necessary for firing this hard\r\npaste. You know of course that most of the mineral pigments used to\r\ndecorate china do not look at all the same after they have been\r\nsubjected to a high temperature as they look before. Many colors which\r\nfire out to exquisite tones look quite ugly when applied to the\r\nbiscuit clay. Both chemists and artists have to be skilled in the\r\nknowledge of how these paints will react under heat. So when I say the\r\nS\xc3\xa8vres workers reached a richness and harmony of color never before\r\nknown in china-making you can imagine how much patient experimental\r\nlabor probably preceded this triumph of art."\r\n\r\nTheo\'s eyes had not left the story-teller\'s face for an instant.\r\n\r\n"It was not as if the painters used only a touch of color here and\r\nthere," continued Mr. Croyden. "Much of the ware was designed with a\r\nsolid color that covered the body, small spaces being reserved for\r\nmedallions in which there were heads or landscapes. The gilding, too,\r\nwas very heavy, and sometimes in combination with it imitation gems\r\nwere used. At the present time a color known as Rose du Barry brings\r\nthe highest price in old S\xc3\xa8vres. Other famous colors in which the\r\nFrench china-makers excelled were Bleu Roi, which was made from\r\ncobalt----"\r\n\r\n"King\'s blue," murmured Theo.\r\n\r\n"Bleu Celeste, a turquoise blue made from copper----"\r\n\r\n"Sky blue!" put in Theo.\r\n\r\n"There was also a rare canary yellow; an apple green; a fine tone of\r\nviolet; and a bright red that had not been seen before in the china\r\nworld. So intense was the interest in the S\xc3\xa8vres factory that even\r\nwhen the French Revolution came and every relic of royalty was\r\ndestroyed by the hooting mobs, the S\xc3\xa8vres works were not touched. You\r\nsee in what a magic realm the old S\xc3\xa8vres ware had its being. We call\r\neverything dating up to 1800 _Old S\xc3\xa8vres_, and you will probably find\r\nit so marked in both public and private collections."\r\n\r\n"Is S\xc3\xa8vres ware still manufactured?" questioned Theo, stumbling\r\ntimidly over the French word.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Mr. Croyden, "there is a modern S\xc3\xa8vres, much of the\r\nsuccess of which is due to Alexandre Brongniart who was both a\r\ngeologist and chemist, and who was the director of the S\xc3\xa8vres\r\nfactories from 1800 to 1850. He did much to perpetuate the industry\r\nand keep up its standard. During his time no piece with an\r\nimperfection in it was allowed to go out from the factory."\r\n\r\n"Was S\xc3\xa8vres the only famous ware the French people made?"\r\n\r\n"It is undoubtedly the most celebrated," replied Mr. Croyden, "but\r\nthere are now many other fine porcelains made in France. For example\r\nat Limoges, where in 1775 p\xc3\xa2te tendre was made, there is a very\r\nextensive porcelain plant founded in 1840 by David Haviland, an\r\nAmerican, from which quantities of p\xc3\xa2te dure or genuine porcelain for\r\nthe American market are annually turned out. Much of the other French\r\nchina, however--dainty, exquisite, and artistic as it is, is p\xc3\xa2te\r\ntendre. It is of course sold in quantities, but it is very perishable.\r\nThere is also a so-called porcelain made from a mixture of clays and\r\nphosphates--a ware known to the trade as _bone china_. But of course\r\nthis variety is not real porcelain. You see that much of what we call\r\nporcelain is not porcelain at all when you judge it by this strict\r\nstandard. It is nevertheless very useful, and a hungry boy like you\r\ncan manage nicely to eat his breakfast off it and be quite as\r\nhappy. Now give me your tray and I\'m off. There will be no more\r\nchina-making to-day, you young scoundrel! See how long you have\r\ncajoled me into lingering already. You almost made me forget that I\r\nwas going fishing."\r\n\r\nWith a friendly pat on the boy\'s shoulder Mr. Croyden disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nHOW THE ITALIANS MADE CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the next few days Theo was in no frame of mind to talk porcelain\r\nor any other serious subject, for his new crutches came, and after Dr.\r\nSwift had adjusted them the boy was like a bird freed from its\r\ncage. He could not, to be sure, go far from the house; but even to\r\nclump up and down the veranda and the plank walks that connected the\r\ncabins was a joy. How good it was to get about once more! But, alas,\r\nthe pace at which the convalescent moved was a constant source of\r\nalarm to all who beheld it. Before the expiration of the first day\r\nTheo had acquired such skill and speed that he hopped about like a\r\nsparrow. There was no such thing as stopping him. He felt bound,\r\nhowever, on his father\'s account to use some caution, and the\r\nrealization that he had already caused trouble enough was a potent\r\nfactor in restraining his fearlessness. Each day saw a gain in his\r\ncondition, and it was evident that before long the injured leg would\r\nbe as good as new.\r\n\r\nYet the exasperating hardship of having still to remain a captive in\r\nthe camp had to be endured. In the meantime the date for the return\r\nhome drew nearer and as the hours of the vacation shortened Theo\'s\r\ndetermination that his father should enjoy every possible moment of\r\nthe time increased. So he was plucky enough to be as careful as he\r\ncould, and while the Doctor and Mr. Croyden fished he invented for\r\nhimself such amusements as were practical within his own more limited\r\nconfines.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, although he did not appear to notice this, Mr. Croyden\r\nfathomed the lad\'s unselfish intention more completely than did any\r\none else. However this may be, certain it was that in spite of his\r\nsorties from the camp the merchant contrived to devote a part of\r\nevery evening to Theo, whose father was occupied in writing a medical\r\npaper to be read before some convention on his return to the city. To\r\nthese evenings with Mr. Croyden the lad looked forward eagerly. They\r\nwere the bright spot in the day. The talks the two had together\r\nusually took place in Mr. Croyden\'s cabin before the open fire where\r\nthe china-makers could converse freely and not disturb Dr. Swift.\r\nSuch a genuine friendship between the boy and the elder man had sprung\r\nup that it would have been difficult to tell which of them anticipated\r\nthis bedtime hour the more.\r\n\r\n"Do you realize, Theo, that we shall not be having many more of these\r\ntalks?" observed Mr. Croyden one evening as they sat cozily ensconced\r\nbefore a roaring blaze. "The last of the week we shall be starting\r\nback to civilization--to starched collars and cuffs, and the rush and\r\nhubbub of city life. For you I suppose it will mean school again; and\r\nfor me it will be a matter of wading through a mountain of business\r\ncorrespondence that has been accumulating while I have been away. We\r\nshall miss these cozy evenings together, shan\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"I certainly shall, Mr. Croyden," answered Theo earnestly.\r\n\r\n"Well, I do not mean they shall die out altogether," Mr. Croyden\r\naffirmed cheerfully. "My plan is to have you come over to Trenton and\r\nmake us a little visit when you get stronger. Would you like to? We\'d\r\ngo all over the china factories, and you could see porcelain made at\r\nfirst hand. What do you think of the scheme?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d like it better than anything else," cried Theo instantly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s settled, then," replied Mr. Croyden. "I fancy your father and\r\nmother will be willing to lend you to me for a little while. You see,\r\nMrs. Croyden and I both enjoy young people very much and we have none\r\nat home. We are particularly fond of boys, and like nothing better\r\nthan to borrow one now and then. If you come you run the risk of our\r\nforgetting to return you; but I guess your parents will see to that,"\r\nhe concluded with a merry laugh.\r\n\r\n"I rather think they will," replied Theo with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Trust them for that," said Mr. Croyden. "You\'d make no mistake to go\r\nback, either, for you have a mighty fine father, sonny."\r\n\r\n"Father\'s--well, he\'s _all right_!" declared Theo tersely but\r\nemphatically. "So is Mother! You must meet Mother some time. She\'s a\r\npeach!"\r\n\r\n"The vacation has done your father a world of good, Theo," reflected\r\nMr. Croyden, looking into the embers. "Do you realize how much better\r\nhe looks? He is much less nervous and tired."\r\n\r\n"I hope so, sir," came heartily from Theo. "I have wanted so much not\r\nto spoil his vacation, for he needed it badly."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you have not spoiled it," put in Mr. Croyden quickly. "You\r\ncan consider that in sending a doctor back to his job in A1 condition\r\nyou have done your bit to help the war. Doctors are among our most\r\nuseful and necessary men."\r\n\r\n"I know it," Theo returned. "Mother and I are tremendously proud of\r\nFather. We feel he is doing a lot of good in the world. I guess now\r\nI\'ll feel that way more than ever for I never knew what it was to be\r\nsick before."\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause, broken only by the velvety rustle of the logs\r\nburning in the chimney; then Theo remarked abruptly:\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you going to tell me anything about china to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Do you wish me to?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do; that is, unless you are too tired."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not tired at all," responded Mr. Croyden. "I thought you might\r\nbe the tired one."\r\n\r\n"I!"\r\n\r\n"Not bored?"\r\n\r\n"Not so you\'d notice it."\r\n\r\n"All right, then; only you\'ll have to let me think a minute," said\r\nMr. Croyden. "Where did we leave off?"\r\n\r\n"You had been telling me about S\xc3\xa8vres ware and other French\r\nporcelains."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! Now I remember. Well, as you can imagine, after kaolin was\r\ndiscovered the secret gradually leaked out, and everybody went to work\r\nat making china. Kings, emperors, and princes; nobles of high birth,\r\nall took up the art with zest, spending great sums of money on\r\nfabriques, as the porcelain factories came to be called. In Florence\r\nFrancis, one of the Dukes of the Medici, built a tiny laboratory in\r\nthe garden of the Boboli palace and there made a rude ware, some of it\r\nhard paste and some of it soft. This was even before the St. Cloud\r\nworks were opened, and certain historians say that this was the first\r\ntrue porcelain made in Europe. At a much later period (about 1735, to\r\nbe exact) the Ginori family, another titled Italian household of\r\nwealth and position, owning estates just outside Florence, took up\r\nporcelain-making, even sending ships to China for the necessary\r\nclay. Fancy it! And to show you how highly this industry was esteemed\r\nI will add that the Marquise himself superintended his workmen and\r\nhelped in manufacturing this Doccia ware, as they styled their\r\noutput."\r\n\r\n"Did this happen during the Renaissance?" inquired Theo timidly. "It\r\nsounds as if it might have."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden nodded, cordially, much gratified by the lad\'s\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n"That was just when it happened," he said. "In the meantime, at about\r\nthe same period, a beautiful soft paste called Capo di Monte was being\r\nmade down in Naples under the patronage of Charles IV--the Charles who\r\nafterward became Charles III of Spain. Like the rest of royalty this\r\nKing became absorbed in china-making--so absorbed that he went\r\nfrequently to work in his factories himself, and each year held a sale\r\nof his products at the gates of his palace; whenever a piece was sold\r\na record of it was made and later the name of the purchaser was\r\nreported to the King."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he, too, made the nobles buy his china," laughed Theo.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid he did," agreed Mr. Croyden. "At least it was a fact\r\nthat he showed especial favor to those who did buy it, which was\r\npractically the same thing. I think I forgot to tell you that the\r\nFrench kings also forced, or perhaps I should say expected, their\r\ncourtiers and ladies to purchase S\xc3\xa8vres ware. It was a custom of the\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"I think it was a rotten custom!" ejaculated Theo wrathfully.\r\n\r\n"Certainly it was not a desirable thing. In our day we should call it\r\ngraft. Still at that time there were plenty of people who were only\r\ntoo anxious to keep their heads on their shoulders, and who would have\r\nbeen glad to buy almost anything in order to do so. Doubtless they\r\nconsidered a little porcelain a small price for their lives, and were\r\nglad to win the favor of a capricious monarch by purchasing it. King\r\nCharles was no worse than all the rest. Later, when he became ruler of\r\nSpain, he took many of his Italian workmen there with him, and as a\r\nconsequence in 1821 the Naples fabrique was closed; many of the\r\nmoulds, as well as much of the outfitting, was sold to the Doccia\r\nworks. As a result Capo di Monte was afterward imitated in Doccia hard\r\nand soft paste; but the original ware which is of value to collectors\r\nwas that made at Naples. It is very difficult to distinguish this\r\nvariety, for the Doccia people even copied the King\'s trade-mark."\r\n\r\n"I suppose people could do that then," ventured Theo.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. There was nothing to protect an invention as there is now,"\r\nreplied Mr. Croyden.\r\n\r\n"Did King Charles continue to make porcelain in Spain?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he had a palace called Buen Retiro and here he established\r\nfabriques that continued to thrive even up to the time of King\r\nFerdinand in 1780, and would probably have prospered much longer had\r\nnot the Napoleonic wars come and the French destroyed the factories."\r\n\r\n"And what became of the Doccia works in the meantime?" queried Theo.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you asked that question," answered Mr. Croyden, "for I had\r\nnot finished speaking about the Doccia fabrique. It was unique in its\r\nmanagement. You know in our day how much we hear of proper factory\r\nconditions? Doubtless you have seen mills where there are neatly\r\ngraded lawns, flower-beds, and perhaps a recreation ground. We\r\nconsider such mill-owners very progressive and speak of them with\r\nkeenest approval. Yet in our enlightened times such things are none\r\ntoo common. Now it is interesting to know that this Ginori family who\r\nfounded the Doccia porcelain works were far in advance of anything we\r\nyet have done for our employees. Not only did they have lawns and\r\ngardens for their workmen, but they also had a park; a farm where\r\nvegetables were raised for the common good; a school for the workmen\'s\r\nchildren; an academy of music where all could go to concerts; and a\r\nsavings-bank in which earnings could be deposited. What do you think\r\nof that for progressiveness?"\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s eyes opened wide.\r\n\r\n"I guess we\'re not so civilized as we think we are," he remarked\r\nsoberly.\r\n\r\n"We are not the only people who ever lived--that\'s sure!" retorted the\r\nTrenton man grimly. "As you can well imagine, the men under the\r\nGinori were very appreciative, and as a mark of their gratitude for\r\nall this kindness they set to work and made for the Ginori chapel\r\nbeautiful porcelain monuments as a tribute to the dead and gone Ginori\r\nnobles. They also made a marvelous high altar all of porcelain, with\r\nmagnificent candlesticks, fonts, and statues--a wonderful embodiment\r\nof their skill as well as their devotion."\r\n\r\n"It must have taken some clay!" exclaimed Theo.\r\n\r\n"I guess it did," Mr. Croyden assented. "Aside from this work the\r\noutput of the Doccia fabrique was largely imitative. They made so many\r\ncopies of S\xc3\xa8vres, Capo di Monte, and Majolica that it soon became a\r\ngreat problem to tell the real from the imitation, and this has caused\r\ncollectors no end of trouble."\r\n\r\n"Was no other porcelain made in Italy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, as far back as 1515 pottery, as I told you, was made in Venice;\r\nand with the discovery of kaolin Venetian merchants imported the true\r\nclay which did not exist in Italy, and manufactured both hard and soft\r\npaste. But the industry was never a success because the expense of\r\ngetting the material was so great. In 1753 the Germans, because of the\r\ncheapness of Italian labor, tried making porcelain there, thinking\r\nthat they could furnish their own clays at slight cost. But the scheme\r\nwas a failure. There was, however, some imitative work done later by a\r\npotter named Cozzi which was very good. But Italy has never excelled\r\nin china-making as she did in the making of glass because she had not\r\nthe material to do any very extensive work. There has, to be sure,\r\nbeen a scattering of porcelains turned out--some from Turin; some from\r\nTreviso; and some from other cities. But aside from the Majolica\r\npottery, and Delia Robbia\'s terra-cottas, Italy has not made any\r\ndistinctive contribution to the china-making art. Still she has done\r\nso much in almost every other art that she should rest content. One\r\ncannot excel in everything."\r\n\r\n"Some of us never excel in anything," laughed Theo.\r\n\r\n"Some of us excel in falling off roofs and breaking our legs,"\r\nchuckled Mr. Croyden teasingly. "And some of us excel in being very\r\npatient about it afterward," he added, patting the boy\'s shoulder\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nOUR ENGLISH COUSINS\r\n\r\n\r\nAll too soon the time came when grips had to be packed, tackle stowed\r\naway, and the campers start out over the carry to meet the train that\r\nwas to take them to New York. The trip was a long and tedious one of\r\ntwo days\' duration. Nevertheless our travelers did not find it\r\nwearisome. On the train were papers and magazines in plenty, and\r\nwhenever Dr. Swift went into the smoking car Theo always found\r\nMr. Croyden near at hand and willing to talk.\r\n\r\n"And when Mr. Croyden is around no place could be dull or stupid,"\r\naffirmed Theo to his father.\r\n\r\n"I believe I shall begin to be jealous of Mr. Croyden, Theo," laughed\r\nDr. Swift good-naturedly. "I am coming to fear that if you go to\r\nvisit him as he wants you to, you never will come back home."\r\n\r\nTheo smiled.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t lose me so easily, Dad," he answered. "Just the same, I\r\nknow if I do go and visit the Croydens I\'ll have a bully time. But I\'d\r\nlike to wait until I get rid of these crutches so I won\'t be a bother\r\nto anybody."\r\n\r\n"That is wise. I should not feel easy if you started out on a visit\r\nbefore you were quite well," replied Dr. Swift. "However, it won\'t be\r\nlong now before you can cast your crutches into the rubbish heap. In\r\nthe meantime your own family can have a visit with you. I rather fancy\r\nyour mother will be thankful to have you home again; she has been\r\npretty anxious about you. No mother likes having her boy where she\r\ncannot get to him when he is ill."\r\n\r\n"But you were there, Dad."\r\n\r\nDr. Swift smiled into the eyes that met his.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was there, to be sure," he assented. "But a doctor is not\r\nnecessarily a good nurse."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how anybody could be a better nurse than you, Father."\r\n\r\nThe Doctor shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I did not fuss much over you," he answered. "At least I\r\ndid not smother you with attention the way your mother would have\r\ndone. You got no spoiling from me. I expect, though, that when your\r\nmother gets hold of you she won\'t be able to do enough for you. I can\r\nsee her to-day flying round the house ordering all the things you like\r\nto eat, and getting everything ready for your coming. I shall have no\r\nattention at all."\r\n\r\nTheo beamed.\r\n\r\n"You will have all the attention you want, and more too, Dad, I\r\nguess," he remarked drily. "Probably a string of patients as long as\r\nthis car will be waiting to pounce on you the minute you set foot in\r\nNew York."\r\n\r\n"I expect so, son. However, I shall not begrudge that sort of a\r\nwelcome now, for I feel like a fighting cock."\r\n\r\n"You really are rested, aren\'t you, Father?"\r\n\r\n"I am like another man," was the vehement reply. "I was about all in\r\nwhen we went into camp. Thanks to you and Mr. Croyden I have had a\r\nfine chance to pull myself together and prepare for whatever comes\r\nnext. You have been very thoughtful and unselfish, Theo, in leaving me\r\nfree to get all I could out of my vacation. It has meant everything."\r\n\r\n"I wanted to help you, Dad."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve certainly proved that, my boy. I\'ve appreciated every bit of\r\nit."\r\n\r\nA quick glance passed between the two.\r\n\r\nThey understood each other very well, Theo and his father.\r\n\r\n"Here is Mr. Croyden," observed Theo. "He has been getting off some\r\nmail and telegrams."\r\n\r\n"That is precisely what I must do," declared the Doctor rising. "I\'ll\r\nleave you to have one of your china-making talks while I am gone."\r\n\r\nAs the Doctor passed through into the next car Mr. Croyden sauntered\r\ndown the aisle and dropped into the seat he had just vacated.\r\n\r\n"There," announced the merchant with a satisfied sigh, "I have done my\r\nduty. I have sent off three telegrams and a lot of letters. How funny\r\nit seems to get busy after being so idle! Next week will see us all\r\nback at the grind, I suppose, and rushing about as if we had never\r\nbeen away."\r\n\r\n"Are you sorry?"\r\n\r\n"No," was the hearty response. "I like to play when I play; but I like\r\nalso to work. I enjoy my business very much. It is an interesting and\r\nuseful one, and I like to think that in my small way I am helping to\r\nfurnish the world with things that are necessary, and tend toward\r\ncomfort and convenience as well as toward beauty. People cannot get on\r\nwithout dishes--you and I have proved that."\r\n\r\n"Not unless we all go back to being savages," said Theo humorously.\r\n\r\n"We shall not do that, I hope," returned Mr. Croyden gravely. "Each\r\ncentury should see the race farther ahead--a more honest, kindlier,\r\nChristian nation. That is the motto we must bring with us out of this\r\nwar. Not more territory, more money, more power; but truer manhood and\r\npurer souls. If the conflict does this for our people all the\r\nsacrifice and loss of life it has meant will not have been in\r\nvain. Out of the wreck a better America should arise, and we each must\r\nhelp it to arise--you as well as I, for we need not only good men and\r\nwomen but good boys and girls, if we are to have a fine country."\r\n\r\n"A boy can\'t do much toward it, I\'m afraid," Theo said.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, a boy can do a great deal," replied Mr. Croyden. "It\r\nis the boys of to-day who are going to be the men of to-morrow; and\r\nthere is no such thing as suddenly becoming a good man, any more than\r\nthere is such a thing as a seed suddenly becoming a full-blown plant.\r\nEverything has to grow, and grow slowly, too. So if you wish to be a\r\nwise, honest citizen who will help forward this glorious country we\r\nall love so much, you want to be setting about it right now, you and\r\nevery other boy. And you want to go at the work earnestly, too, for\r\nyou will be a man before you know it."\r\n\r\n"It looks a long way off to me now," mused Theo.\r\n\r\n"Such things always do; but time flies pretty fast. You will find\r\nyourself in college the next thing you know; and after that you will\r\nbe beginning to plan your career. What are you going to be, Theo?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, sir," was the uncertain answer. "I\'d just like to do\r\nsomething that really needs to be done; something that people cannot\r\nget on without."\r\n\r\n"That is a splendid ambition," came heartily from Mr. Croyden. "I\r\nthought perhaps you\'d be thinking of taking up your father\'s job."\r\n\r\n"I be a surgeon!" gasped Theo.\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, because I\'d be no good at it," the boy said. "I should never\r\nknow what to do with sick people. I\'d be scared to death. It seems to\r\nme now that I would rather go into making something; but I do not just\r\nknow what."\r\n\r\n"You want to be a business man, eh?"\r\n\r\n"That is what I\'d rather do."\r\n\r\n"Humph!"\r\n\r\nThere was an interval of silence; then Mr. Croyden said:\r\n\r\n"Well, if when you are through your education, Theo, we are out of\r\nthis war and you are still of the same mind, you come to me. Who knows\r\nbut you might end your days in my factories?"\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n"Croyden and Swift--how would that sound?"\r\n\r\n"It would sound all right," chuckled Theo, "but I am afraid the sound\r\nwould be the best part of it. Why, I\'d never be able to learn all you\r\nknow about china if I lived to be a hundred years old."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you learning things about china right now? Haven\'t you already\r\nlearned about the pottery and porcelain of almost every nation under\r\nthe sun?"\r\n\r\n"I have liked to have you tell me about it," replied Theo modestly.\r\n\r\n"Well, isn\'t that making a beginning?" queried the pottery\r\nmerchant. "We have discussed the china output of almost every country,\r\nhaven\'t we?"\r\n\r\nTheo reflected.\r\n\r\n"All the big countries except England."\r\n\r\n"How did we happen to leave England out?"\r\n\r\n"I guess you did not have time to get round to England," answered\r\nTheo. "Still all the time isn\'t gone yet, you know; you might tell me\r\nabout England now."\r\n\r\nThey both laughed.\r\n\r\n"I believe you are something of a diplomat, Theo," observed\r\nMr. Croyden. "You are either a diplomat or you are a schemer.\r\nSometimes it is very hard to tell the one from the other. In either\r\ncase you seem determined to give me no peace, so I fancy I may as well\r\ntell you about English porcelain and have done with it. If I do not do\r\nit now I shall have to do it some other time, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you will," came delightedly from Theo.\r\n\r\n"Well, here goes, then!"\r\n\r\nThe elder man settled back into a comfortable position and Theo\r\nwriggled contentedly into the opposite corner of the seat.\r\n\r\n"As you can well understand," began Mr. Croyden, "the discovery of\r\nkaolin set England as eagerly to experimenting at porcelain-making as\r\nit had the other nations. Contrary, however, to other countries the\r\nEnglish Government lent no helping hand to the industry, offering\r\nneither money nor inducements to those who would take it up. Therefore\r\nonly those persons who were sufficiently interested in the new\r\nventure, and could afford to make the attempt with their own capital,\r\ndared go into it. Fortunately there were at hand some of these\r\nambitious manufacturers. Their early experiences are interesting not\r\nso much because of the quality of their work though much of it was\r\ngood, as because they were the forerunners of later workers. The paste\r\nthey used was not as fine as that of the Chinese or Japanese; or in\r\nfact, that of the early Dresden or S\xc3\xa8vres ware. Gradually, however, it\r\nbecame better, until now--although England turns out almost no true\r\nporcelain, that is, the scientifically blended kaolin and petuntse\r\nclays--she makes some of the most beautiful and durable china\r\nmanufactured anywhere."\r\n\r\n"What is it made of?" inquired Theo, much puzzled.\r\n\r\n"Different combinations of kaolin clays and phosphates; a ware which\r\nin the porcelain trade is known as bone china," replied Mr. Croyden.\r\n"The phosphate of lime that is mixed with the kaolin renders the body\r\nof the ware more porous and elastic. On such china the glaze does not\r\nblend with the body and become an actual part of it as is the case\r\nwith a true porcelain, but on the contrary is an outer coating which\r\ncan be scratched through. But bone china is very strong, and does not\r\nchip as does a more brittle variety. For that reason where wear and\r\ndurability are desired it is often preferred."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden stopped a second.\r\n\r\n"When I tell you these facts you must not think I am crying down the\r\nEnglish wares," he said. "I could show you beautiful varieties of\r\nEnglish porcelain. I merely wish you to understand that it has not the\r\nqualities of the Chinese, Japanese, S\xc3\xa8vres, Dresden, or even the more\r\nmodern Limoges ware. But what it loses in delicacy and translucence it\r\nmakes up in strength, and perhaps after all strength is as desirable\r\nas any other quality."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t the English ever make any real hard paste china?" asked Theo.\r\n\r\n"It is said that between 1730 and 1744 they did make some; and this\r\nproduct is supposed to be the only true porcelain ever made in\r\nEngland. It was manufactured at Stratford-le-Bow, and where do you\r\nthink the clay for it came from? Strangely enough from our own State\r\nof Virginia. You can imagine the expense of bringing the clay across\r\nthe Atlantic. This ware known for convenience as Bow became very\r\npopular. The first of it was hand-painted, but later the designs were\r\ntransferred, and the product became cheaper. Not only were tea sets\r\nmade, but also a great number of china figures of birds, animals, and\r\nshepherdesses; there were even some statuettes of celebrities of the\r\ntime, which remain as an interesting record of the costumes of the\r\nperiod. Owing to the fact that much of the Bow china was unmarked it\r\nis frequently confused with the soft ware made at Chelsea, which was\r\nalso of early English manufacture."\r\n\r\n"Did the Bow factories continue?" asked Theo.\r\n\r\n"About 1775 the Bow works were merged with those of Derby; and in\r\n1784, the Chelsea fabrique was also absorbed by the Derby\r\ncompany. Derby china, especially Crown Derby, you must remember, is\r\none of the finest of present day English wares. About 1777 these\r\nfactories came under the patronage of King George III, at which time\r\nthe term Crown Derby was bestowed on the product."\r\n\r\n"Then an English king did help in English porcelain-making after all!"\r\nexclaimed Theo.\r\n\r\n"To a certain extent, yes," answered Mr. Croyden. "The English\r\nnobility, too, patronized the royal factories. The ware was so\r\nbeautiful perhaps people were only too glad to do so. There were\r\nplates with deep borders of solid rich color, frequently adorned with\r\nheavy gold work; and there were vases, pitchers, and bowls of\r\nmagnificent hue. In fact, the use of blue and gold was brought to a\r\ngreater perfection in this ware than ever before, and it established\r\nfor the makers a wide-reaching reputation. Possibly this reputation\r\nmight have remained pre\xc3\xabminent had not the short-sighted manufacturers\r\nbegun to sell at a lower rate their imperfect pieces, or seconds.\r\nGreat quantities of these flooded the market and immediately the fame\r\nof the ware decreased."\r\n\r\n"What a pity!"\r\n\r\n"Since then this erroneous policy has been corrected in so far as has\r\nbeen possible; but the blot on the history of the Derby porcelain\r\nremains, proving that a firm that values its standing should never\r\nallow imperfect products to go beyond its doors. William Cookworthy,\r\nwho, by the way, made the Bow china and who lived at Plymouth,\r\nEngland, in 1760, finally discovered deposits of true kaolin at\r\nCornwall, and of this material made some more true porcelain; but\r\nunfortunately much of it was injured in the firing. His workmen did\r\nnot understand the difficulties and dangers of exposing the ware to\r\nthe extreme heat. But this Plymouth ware held an interesting place in\r\nthe development of English china-making."\r\n\r\n"Did the Plymouth works grow and become larger?" asked Theo.\r\n\r\n"Alas, much beautiful porcelain, copied to a great extent from Chinese\r\nand Continental wares, was made there, but the expense of turning it\r\nout was so great that poor Cookworthy sunk a fortune in the\r\nenterprise. However, the venture was not without its fruits, for out\r\nof the Plymouth fabrique developed that of Bristol, and later that of\r\nShelton, or New Hall. All of these plants manufactured hard paste\r\nchinas. At Bristol in 1774 a wonderfully fine tea and coffee set was\r\nmade for Edmund Burke, the renowned English orator. In the meantime\r\nall over England small fabriques were springing up. At Pinxton,\r\nSwansea, Coalport, Liverpool and Rockingham; most of these factories\r\nmade soft paste chinas. Then came an innovation. One of the most\r\nperfect of English porcelains, known as Spode, was produced by\r\ncombining with this type of paste pulverized bones."\r\n\r\n"Bones!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. It seems a strange idea, doesn\'t it? But it was a great\r\ndiscovery, and one that has been generally adopted and used ever since\r\nby the principal china-making firms of England. The bone element, or\r\nphosphate of lime, as it is more properly termed, imparts both\r\nstrength and elasticity to the china. Minton ware, first made in 1791\r\nand now extensively manufactured in England and sold throughout the\r\nchina-buying world, is one of these bone chinas. It is a great\r\nfavorite because of its durability as well as its beauty. There were\r\nin addition many other very fine chinas made in England--far too many\r\nof them for me to enumerate. One was the Lowestoft, made from about\r\n1756 in soft paste, and in 1775 in hard. Much of it is in imitation of\r\nthe Chinese, although some was decorated with roses, and some with\r\nlandscapes or coats of arms. As it had no mark upon it it is now\r\ndifficult to be sure of the genuine ware. Moreover, a large amount of\r\nthe white porcelain, it is said, was sent from China to Lowestoft to\r\nbe decorated, and therefore the body of it is of Oriental and not\r\nEnglish make. Worcester is another of the celebrated soft paste\r\nchinas, which at first copied Oriental designs, and later branched off\r\ninto imitations of Dresden or S\xc3\xa8vres wares. It is still made and\r\nwidely sold."\r\n\r\n"It seems as if a great many of the English wares were copies of\r\nsomebody else\'s work," remarked Theo.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid they were," owned Mr. Croyden. "England was not rich in\r\noriginality of design. The work of Wedgwood is the only distinctively\r\ninventive contribution made to the china-making art. However, the\r\nEnglish bone porcelains are very beautiful, and though they are not\r\ngenuine feldspathic products they are highly esteemed and in demand\r\neverywhere. Now you must own, Theo, that I have given you a pretty\r\ncomplete outline of the pottery and porcelain-making of the European\r\ncountries. Holland and Belgium, as I have told you, lack both clay and\r\nfuel and therefore had not a fair chance to compete with the other\r\nnations; but they did make some little porcelain. Sweden also turned\r\nout a little. Denmark gave a real contribution to the world in its\r\nCopenhagen ware, a type of white porcelain decorated beneath the glaze\r\nin cobalt. The fabrique for making this china was opened as early as\r\n1760 but it never paid, and in 1775 the Government took over the works\r\nand it became a royal factory where women of rank and position joined\r\nthe artists in designing and decorating the porcelain. The\r\nundertaking, however, proved so expensive that in 1876 the factories\r\nwent back into private hands. But the porcelain has become\r\nworld-famous and holds its place in the list of the distinctive chinas\r\nof the art universe. Look up Royal Copenhagen some time, and see how\r\nbeautiful it is."\r\n\r\n"I will," nodded Theo. "But in all this china-making did Russia do\r\nnothing?"\r\n\r\n"Russia made her try," Mr. Croyden said. "Peter the Great was an\r\nambitious ruler who traveled the Continent over to see what other\r\ncountries were doing in the way of commerce and manufacture. When he\r\nreturned from one of his pilgrimages he made the people build a new\r\ncommercial and industrial centre--St. Petersburg, now Petrograd. Here\r\nhe set his subjects to making all sorts of artistic things such as he\r\nhad seen in Europe, especially brass, copper, and silver\r\narticles. From 1744 to 1765 under the Empresses Elizabeth and\r\nCatherine II a little really fine hard paste was produced. It was a\r\nporcelain in imitation of Dresden; but there never was very much of it\r\nmanufactured. A little Russian porcelain was also made at Moscow and\r\nPoland. The Russians never excelled in pottery and porcelain-making,\r\nhowever, as they did in metal work."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden rose.\r\n\r\n"See," he said, "here comes your father! That means that we must bid\r\ngood-bye to china-making for to-day. I fear we shall have to say\r\ngood-bye to it altogether, too, for by to-morrow morning we shall be\r\ngetting into New York and separating for home. But you are not to\r\nforget, Theo, that I want you to come to Trenton the first minute you\r\nare rid of these crutches. Then I shall tramp you through my factories\r\nand you shall see how all this porcelain we have talked of is made."\r\n\r\n"I shall be mighty glad to come," responded Theo.\r\n\r\n"I must leave it to your father\'s discretion, then, to notify me when\r\nhe thinks you are able to make the visit," added the merchant, turning\r\nto Dr. Swift who had just joined them. "You just telephone me, Doctor,\r\nwhen you think you can spare this boy of yours; will you?"\r\n\r\n"You are very kind, Croyden."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit! Not a bit!" protested Mr. Croyden. "I shall want to see\r\nTheo, and I am anxious to have Mrs. Croyden meet him too. I only wish\r\nwe had a boy just like him; then I\'d have somebody to leave my\r\nbusiness to."\r\n\r\nHe drummed on the window moodily.\r\n\r\n"Who knows but I may be coming to help you make china one of these\r\ndays, sir," suggested Theo half jokingly.\r\n\r\nThe man wheeled sharply.\r\n\r\n"I wish I thought you would," was his quick response. "If at the end\r\nof your college career you find yourself with any such notion, sonny,\r\nyou\'ll be very welcome."\r\n\r\nWith an affectionate glance at the boy Mr. Croyden strode off into\r\nthe smoking-car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHEO MAKES A PRESENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was great rejoicing when Theo and his father reached home. It\r\nseemed as if Mrs. Swift could never do enough for her boy. The whole\r\nhouse was turned upside down to make him comfortable, and on the\r\ndinner table were all his favorite dishes.\r\n\r\n"To see your mother, Theo, anybody would think you were a fragile\r\ninvalid just out of the hospital rather than a husky young camper\r\nreturned from the woods," growled the Doctor. "My dear," he\r\ncontinued, addressing his wife, "Theo hasn\'t had as much attention as\r\nthis in all the time he has been ill. Croyden and I have not pranced\r\nround after him, I assure you. He has had to brace up and bear his\r\ntroubles like a soldier; and he has done it, too."\r\n\r\n"I suppose soldiers do have to be pretty patient," remarked Theo\r\nmeditatively. "I never thought before how hard it must be for them\r\nwhen they are hurt."\r\n\r\n"It is one of the great tests of courage," said Dr. Swift. "We all are\r\nliable to think of soldiers only when the drums are beating and the\r\nflags flying. Then it seems a very easy and pleasant thing to be a\r\nsoldier. But there is much more to it than that. A great deal of\r\ndrudgery is attached to a soldier\'s life, and frequently a great deal\r\nof suffering. One of the tests of a hero is to be patient when there\r\nis nothing to do but await orders, or perform some menial and\r\nuninteresting task, or lie tossing on a sick-bed. Then you find out\r\nvery quickly the sort of stuff your man is made of. Those who fight\r\nare not the biggest heroes. Often the noblest and most helpful men\r\nare those who themselves are not only cheerful under monotony and\r\ndullness, but aid their comrades to be so. Therefore, Theo, when you\r\ntook it upon yourself to bear your troubles in the Maine woods bravely\r\nyou proved you had the first essential of a good soldier."\r\n\r\nTheo flushed with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"That is why we cannot have your mother undoing your virtuous\r\ndeeds," continued the Doctor whimsically. "We must make her realize\r\nshe has a man and not a baby to deal with. Theo is no invalid,\r\nLouisa. On the contrary, he is going right to school to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Not with those crutches!" protested Mrs. Swift.\r\n\r\n"Why not? He has the term to finish, and certainly you would not have\r\nhim flat out on his job when the end is in sight. It is only a few\r\nweeks to the last of June. The fishing trip was a vacation; and if he\r\ngot more vacation out of it than he calculated," went on Dr. Swift\r\nwith a twinkle in his eye, "why, so much the better. He is that much\r\nto the good."\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather finish my school year, Mother," rejoined Theo.\r\n\r\n"Well, apparently it is two against one," smiled Mrs. Swift. "Your\r\nfather is, of course, a far better judge of your condition than\r\nI. Broken bones are in his line. But do be careful, son, and not go\r\nskipping on and off cars when they are moving, or doing things that\r\nare going to worry me."\r\n\r\n"Rest easy, Mother. I\'ll promise not to take any chances," Theo\r\nreplied promptly. "I am far too eager to get well. It is no fun to be\r\nhobbling about. Besides, I want to be in trim to go to the Croydens as\r\nsoon as school is over."\r\n\r\n"Your father says Mr. Croyden was very kind to you while you were in\r\ncamp."\r\n\r\n"He was bully!"\r\n\r\n"It would be nice if you could do something to show that you\r\nappreciated it," observed Mrs. Swift vaguely.\r\n\r\nInstantly Theo caught at the suggestion.\r\n\r\n"I wish I could!" he declared. "Can\'t you think of something, Mother?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Swift paused a moment.\r\n\r\n"It would be of no use to do anything unless it was something you did\r\nyourself," she said at last. "Of course your father and I could give\r\nyou the money to buy a present; but after all that would be our\r\npresent and not yours."\r\n\r\n"Oh, a gift we bought would not be of the slightest use," cut in\r\nDr. Swift. "It would spoil the whole idea. Either Theo would have to\r\npurchase something with his own money----"\r\n\r\n"I have only saved a dollar out of my allowance," interrupted Theo\r\ndubiously.\r\n\r\n"Or he would have to do something, or make something, for\r\nMr. Croyden," concluded the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what I could do," mused Theo.\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t make anything, son?" asked his mother.\r\n\r\n"Nothing good enough," responded Theo, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t they teach you how to make anything at school?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"All head and no hands, I suppose," retorted Dr. Swift\r\nscornfully. "That is the way with our modern educational system. It is\r\na poor plan on which to bring up a boy. I wish I had realized it\r\nbefore. Louisa, why didn\'t you see to this?" blustered the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"You picked out Theo\'s studies yourself, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. You took the outline and checked off the things you wished\r\nTheo to take this year."\r\n\r\n"You did, Father," put in Theo.\r\n\r\n"When did I do it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, one day when you were on your way to a hospital meeting,"\r\nanswered the boy. "You were in a hurry, and you stood out in the hall\r\nand marked the list with your fountain-pen."\r\n\r\n"Then I am heartily ashamed of myself," confessed Dr. Swift\r\ncandidly. "I had no right to do anything of the sort. I should have\r\nsat down and put some thought into the matter. Do you suppose it would\r\nbe too late, son, for you to change your course of study this term?"\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t want to change it much, Dad," replied Theo. "I\'d be sorry\r\nto give up any of the things I am taking, for I have worked hard at\r\nthem and it would be discouraging to have my time all thrown away. But\r\nperhaps now that I am knocked out of athletics I might put those extra\r\nhours into something else. Some of the boys take sloyd."\r\n\r\n"The very thing!" exclaimed the Doctor. "Manual training is just what\r\nwe\'re after. You would enjoy it, too."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether I would or not, Dad," returned Theo frankly. "I\r\nnever was much good with tools. I like athletics better."\r\n\r\n"That is because you have never learned to use tools properly," said\r\nhis father. "Where do you suppose I\'d be now if I hadn\'t started out\r\nwhen I was a boy to tinker round a farm? That\'s where I got my manual\r\ntraining, and there isn\'t a course in the country that can equal it. I\r\nhad to use my brains, too, as well as my hands, for very often the\r\nthings I needed were not to be had and I was forced to make something\r\nelse do. It was a great education, I can tell you! What skill I have\r\nat surgery I attribute largely to that early training. Now we\'ll set\r\nright to work to remedy this lack in you, son. I\'ll see your principal\r\nto-day and arrange for you to begin sloyd when you go back to school."\r\n\r\nTheo made a grimace at which his father laughed.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t like it you can at least take it as a medicine,"\r\nremarked the Doctor with a grin.\r\n\r\nDr. Swift was as good as his word, for when Theo returned to school\r\nthe following day he found that in addition to his other work he was\r\nexpected to spend an hour each morning in the carpenter\'s shop, a\r\nrealm toward which he had always maintained the keenest scorn. It\r\nseemed such a foolish thing to learn to saw and drive nails! What was\r\nthe use of taking lessons? When a board was to be cut what was there\r\nto do but take the saw and cut it? It was easy enough. As for driving\r\nnails--that feat required no teaching.\r\n\r\nBut to Theo\'s amazement it needed only the first lesson to demonstrate\r\nto him that these superficial conclusions were quite wrong. It was one\r\nthing to cut a board haphazard; but quite another matter to cut it\r\nevenly, and on a ruled line. Nor was the driving of nails as simple\r\nas he had supposed. At the end of the first hour Theo, feeling very\r\nawkward and clumsy, and rubbing a finger that had been too slow to get\r\nout of the path of the hammer, left the workshop.\r\n\r\n"I never dreamed it would be so hard!" he muttered, viewing his\r\nbleeding knuckle with chagrin.\r\n\r\nThe lesson of the following day did not prove much easier, and its\r\ndifficulties aroused the lad\'s fighting spirit.\r\n\r\n"I am going to learn to saw and drive nails properly if it takes me\r\nthe rest of my life!" he declared resolutely. "The very idea! Why,\r\nsome of those little chaps in the sloyd room can chisel and plane like\r\ncarpenters. I\'ll bet I can do it, too, if I stick at it."\r\n\r\nTherefore it came about that instead of missing tennis and basket-ball\r\nas he had expected, Theo became completely absorbed in his new\r\ninterest--so absorbed that his father soon began to fear that his\r\nstudies would suffer. Early and late Theo was at his bench with his\r\ntools. He tried faithfully not to slight his books, but there was no\r\nuse pretending he did not enjoy his carpentry. He was making a\r\nfootstool now, a little wooden piece with turned legs which he was to\r\nstain with orange shellac and give to his mother. Already he had\r\nfinished a square tray and a handkerchief box. When the stool was\r\ncompleted he was preparing for a more ambitious enterprise, a thing he\r\nlonged yet hesitated to venture upon--a wooden bookrack for\r\nMr. Croyden.\r\n\r\nIt was to be made from oak, not from the ordinary pine wood on which,\r\nup to this time, he had been working; and it was to be a much more\r\nelaborately finished article than anything he had undertaken. He had\r\ndelayed beginning it until the closing part of the term in order that\r\nhe might have the benefit of every atom of training he could get\r\nbefore he made the first cuts in the wood. As he now framed his plans\r\nfor the making of the gift he smiled to think how impossible such a\r\nproject would have been a few months ago.\r\n\r\n"Dad was right!" he affirmed. "Training your hands is just like\r\ntraining any other part of your body. The longer and more regularly\r\nyou keep at it the more expert you get. Sloyd is no different from\r\nrowing, or football, or tennis."\r\n\r\nWith the help of his instructor he drew his design, measured his\r\npattern, and sent for the wood.\r\n\r\nThen, impatient to begin work, he waited.\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden\'s birthday he had learned came the last part of June, and\r\nas on that date school ended he had only a short time to make his\r\npresent. Not only must the pieces be cut and nailed together but\r\nthere was all the finishing, glueing, and varnishing. In addition an\r\ninterval was also necessary for drying. Therefore it was imperative\r\nthat he set about his task as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nYet day after day went by and the wood did not come.\r\n\r\nTheo was almost beside himself.\r\n\r\nFirst he was merely impatient, then angry, then discouraged.\r\n\r\nIt was not until he had about given up hope of being able to complete\r\nthe rack that the wood arrived. The pieces were beautifully grained,\r\nand when Theo beheld them he could in his mind\'s eye see the\r\nbookshelves shaped, smoothed, and rubbed down. He must finish the gift\r\nif he toiled nights as well as days! It is doubtful if ever a boy\r\nworked as hard or as anxiously as did Theo during the next two\r\nweeks. And as his creation took form how happy he was! He cut the\r\nthree shelves, shaped the ends of the rack, and under his teacher\'s\r\ndirection carved on a jig-saw the simple ornament which was to\r\ndecorate the top. Never in his whole life had he enjoyed making\r\nanything so much. Then came the day when the final coat of oil was\r\napplied and there was nothing more to do but wait until it dried. But\r\nthe work had required more time than Theo had anticipated, and\r\ntherefore it was not until the very afternoon before Mr. Croyden\'s\r\nbirthday that the shelves were dry enough to be packed. Dr. Swift\'s\r\nmotor came to the school that day to get Theo, and the boy himself\r\nproudly carried his masterpiece out to the car and put it inside; then\r\nspringing in he called to the chauffeur to drive home. Arriving at his\r\nown abode Theo leaped up the brown stone steps with quick stride and\r\nrang the bell; then as he stood waiting for the door to be opened a\r\nsudden recollection overwhelmed him. In his eagerness to display his\r\nhandiwork to his parents he had entirely forgotten his crutches! They\r\nwere at school, and he now remembered he had not used them since\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nHis father laughed heartily when Theo told him this.\r\n\r\n"I guess that means you can do without crutches from now on, son," the\r\nDoctor said.\r\n\r\n"Does it mean that I may go to the Croydens\', Dad?"\r\n\r\n"I should say so," was the ready response. "I will call Mr. Croyden up\r\non the telephone and find out when he wants you to come. What a joke\r\nit would be if you should go to Trenton and carry your bookrack with\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\nIt subsequently proved that there was more truth than fiction in this\r\njest, for in answer to Dr. Swift\'s inquiry Mr. Croyden announced that\r\nhe happened to be coming into New York that very day in his car, and\r\nif the Swifts were willing he would carry Theo back with him.\r\n\r\n"That will be the very thing!" exclaimed the boy in delight. "We can\r\ndo the shelves all up so he won\'t guess what they are, and I can take\r\nthem right along. Then they will be safe at Mr. Croyden\'s house and I\r\nshall not run the risk of the expressman being late. You know\r\nexpressmen always are late. Think how long they were getting my\r\ncrutches to Maine."\r\n\r\nAccordingly the shelves were packed with greatest care in many soft\r\npapers so they would not be scratched, and afterward they were wrapped\r\nin a stouter outside covering. When the parcel was tied up no one\r\nwould have suspected what was inside, and Theo viewed the mysterious\r\nbundle with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Croyden will think that for a small boy you travel with a good\r\ndeal of luggage," chuckled the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Maybe he won\'t have room to take it," Mrs. Swift rejoined.\r\n\r\nTheo\'s face fell.\r\n\r\n"He must take it," he said, "even if I walk to Trenton myself."\r\n\r\nBut there was room, plenty of it, in the big touring car.\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden did, to be sure, comment teasingly about the lad\'s\r\nextended wardrobe, and ask how many dozen suits of clothes he had\r\nbrought with him; but he made no objection to taking either the bundle\r\nor the suit-case.\r\n\r\nAnd when that night just before dinner Theo slipped into the\r\ndining-room and placed the shelves beside Mr. Croyden\'s chair no boy\r\ncould have been happier. The only person happier than Theo himself was\r\nthe man who received them.\r\n\r\n"My, but this is a present!" exclaimed the merchant. "And you made\r\nthem all yourself? I can hardly believe it. Why, they are beautifully\r\nfinished! And isn\'t it a queer thing that only yesterday I told\r\nMrs. Croyden I must buy some bookshelves for my office? You remember,\r\ndon\'t you, Madeline?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Croyden nodded.\r\n\r\n"Those were his very words," affirmed Mrs. Croyden, turning to\r\nTheo. "He said it only at breakfast. I believe it was mental\r\ntelepathy, Theo."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THIS IS A PRESENT"]\r\n\r\nTheo beamed.\r\n\r\nHe had really succeeded then in giving Mr. Croyden something he\r\nwanted! That was pleasure enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE TRENTON VISIT\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A]\r\n\r\nAlthough originally planned to be of only a week\'s duration, Theo\'s\r\nvisit to the Croydens stretched on into the second week before any one\r\nseemed to realize it. Ten days passed and still the lad had not been\r\nto the porcelain works--one of his chief aims in coming to\r\nTrenton. Each morning at breakfast Mrs. Croyden presented so many\r\ndelightful plans for the day, and was so eager to have Theo accompany\r\nher to the golf club, the tennis club, or for a motor ride, that the\r\nhours sped by and night came only too soon.\r\n\r\nFor Mrs. Croyden was a marvelous comrade for a boy, a strange mixture\r\nof youthfulness and maturity; of feminine charm and masculine freedom\r\nfrom conventionality. She loved boys and understood how to be one with\r\nthem, and in consequence the friendship that at first had extended\r\nonly to Mr. Croyden Theo now stretched to include her. Nor did the\r\nstretching demand effort. Who could have resisted the sweet wholesome\r\ninterest of this fascinating woman with her soft brown eyes, her quick\r\nsympathy, and her girlish love of sport?\r\n\r\nAs the days fled by a tie of real affection strengthened between them,\r\nand Theo found himself talking with an amazing freedom of his dreams\r\nand ambitions; of his chums; and of his life at home. To all these\r\nthings Mrs. Croyden listened earnestly, now and then putting in a word\r\nof interest or encouragement. Sometimes in the evening Mr. Croyden\r\njoined in these talks; and sometimes all three of them abandoned life\r\nand its problems and went to the theatre, or to a moving picture show.\r\n\r\n"I declare, Theo, I don\'t know how we are to do without you when you\r\ngo back home," exclaimed Mr. Croyden one night at dinner. "It will\r\nleave a big hole in the house, won\'t it, Madeline?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Croyden nodded and a shadow passed across her face.\r\n\r\n"I wish we might borrow Theo for a long, long time," she sighed\r\nwistfully. "But I suppose your family would not listen to that,\r\nladdie."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not," Theo answered. "Mother seems to be getting a little\r\nimpatient as it is. She thinks I\'ve been gone a pretty long time."\r\n\r\n"Long? Nonsense! Why, you\'ve only just come," Mr. Croyden said\r\nemphatically. "Up to now you have been visiting Mrs. Croyden. You\r\nhaven\'t been my guest at all. Haven\'t we got the porcelain works ahead\r\nof us? That will take the best part of another week."\r\n\r\n"Then I am afraid I\'d better be getting at it," laughed Theo, "for\r\nMother writes we\'re to leave for Lake George the middle of July."\r\n\r\n"Mercy on us!" blustered Mr. Croyden. "I don\'t see how you can. The\r\nmiddle of July? That settles it. There must be no more kidnapping\r\nTheo for golf or tennis, Madeline. From now on he is to be my\r\nguest. Understand that."\r\n\r\nMrs. Croyden bowed her head with amusing meekness.\r\n\r\n"It shall be as you say, my lord," she answered. "But are you\r\nexpecting to take Theo to the factory every moment of every day?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," was the grim reply. "That will all depend on how\r\nrapidly he learns the business."\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh.\r\n\r\n"How long has it taken you to learn it, Mr. Croyden?" questioned Theo\r\nmischievously.\r\n\r\n"Me? Oh, about thirty years."\r\n\r\n"Then at that rate I see I shall not get to Lake George this season,"\r\nreturned the boy with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll be easy with you this first time," Mr. Croyden answered. "I\r\ncannot afford to kill you or get you frightened, or you never will\r\ncome again."\r\n\r\n"I guess you needn\'t worry about my not coming again," Theo\r\nretorted. "I have had far too good a time."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of that," the elder man asserted heartily.\r\n\r\n"And I, too, Theo," murmured Mrs. Croyden. "Do not forget that you\r\nhave given us far more pleasure than you could possibly have received.\r\nMr. Croyden and I are often very lonely for a son like you. It has\r\nbeen a boon to have you here. That is why you must not let this\r\nambitious husband of mine tire you all out by setting you too\r\nstrenuously at porcelain-making," she added playfully. "Is it\r\nto-morrow that you plan to drag Theo forth on this crusade to the\r\nfactory, my dear?"\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden glanced up at the words.\r\n\r\n"Yes, to-morrow morning. I shall take Theo down to the works with me\r\ndirectly after breakfast," he answered. "You better get to bed early\r\nto-night, son, so to be prepared for the worst."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t waste any worry about the trip," grinned Theo as they rose\r\nfrom the dinner table.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm night, and the three strolled out on the veranda, which\r\noverlooked the green of the country club.\r\n\r\n"I suppose," Theo remarked, "nobody has any idea when pottery and\r\nporcelain were first made in America."\r\n\r\n"Barring out the pottery of the Mound Builders, the American Indians,\r\nand the early clay work done in West Virginia I imagine our modern\r\nchina was first introduced into America at Philadelphia," Mr. Croyden\r\nsaid. "At least records would indicate that to be the case. Between\r\n1760 and 1770 potteries sprung up there and thrived so lustily that\r\nWedgwood noted their success and urged the English government to check\r\nthem lest they injure English trade. At these Philadelphia factories\r\nhard porcelain with a good quality of glaze was turned out; also much\r\nblue and white stone-china in the form of jars, butter-pots, bowls,\r\nand plates. Some mortars and pestles such as Wedgwood himself made\r\nwere also manufactured, so what wonder that he was disturbed at the\r\nthought of losing the monopoly? In a letter to a friend he speaks of\r\npottery being made in the Carolinas as well, and declares it would be\r\na great calamity were the colonies to begin making their own dishes."\r\n\r\n"The idea!" burst out Theo.\r\n\r\n"It was business," replied Mr. Croyden. "Of course England would far\r\nrather ship her wares to America and collect the revenue than to have\r\nthe colonists learn to do without her. For a long time, as the early\r\npapers assure us, crates of Queen\'s ware and the coarser brown\r\nearthenwares, as well as quantities of stone-china continued to be\r\nshipped to America, and advertised for sale. In the meantime,\r\nhowever, the new settlers were contriving to make earthenware jars,\r\njugs, flasks, mugs, and teapots of their own, and supplemented by the\r\npewter dishes they had brought with them from England, they were\r\nmanaging to get on very well without outside aid. Not only was salt\r\nglaze pottery manufactured in Philadelphia along with a small amount\r\nof real porcelain, but in such Connecticut towns as Norwalk, Hartford,\r\nand Stonington experiments with earthenware were also being made. By\r\n1810 the Secretary of the Treasury reported great progress in the\r\nmanufacture of Queen\'s ware, and it is evident from what he says that\r\nby this time the coarser varieties of earthenware were being very\r\ngenerally manufactured; he also mentions four factories for the finer\r\ntypes of porcelain-making."\r\n\r\n"I think we did pretty well to get to making so much chinaware in such\r\na short time," Theo observed.\r\n\r\n"We did do well for a new country," agreed Mr. Croyden, "but you must\r\nremember we had the whip-lash of necessity at our backs. The wares\r\nimported from England were very expensive, and dishes we were forced\r\nto have; especially the simpler utensils for household use. People\r\nmade their own butter, and needed crocks to keep it in; they needed\r\njugs for milk or water; bowls for cooking. Of course no growing\r\ncountry could continue to import such every-day articles from across\r\nthe sea. Therefore, although England tried very hard to cater to\r\nAmerican tastes and demands by sending over blue and white stone-china\r\ndecorated with American views, and even pitchers adorned with\r\nportraits of Washington, the American Eagle, and the names of the\r\nthirteen original States, we did not allow ourselves to be tempted\r\naway from our undertakings, but went right on increasing our own\r\nmanufactures."\r\n\r\n"Bully for us!" cried Theo.\r\n\r\n"So I say!" rejoined Mrs. Croyden with spirit.\r\n\r\n"It was the only thing to do," admitted Mr. Croyden. "We kept at it,\r\ntoo. In 1829 a factory was opened in Jersey City which although not a\r\nsuccess was the forerunner of New Jersey china-making. The industry\r\nwas also taken up in Bennington, Vermont, where the first Parian\r\nmarble statues ever made in America were produced. Baltimore was the\r\nnext city to adopt the china trade, and afterward Trenton. Most of\r\nthis output was thick white graniteware, Rockingham, and stoneware;\r\nsome of it was decorated, but most of it was plain white. It was\r\nuseful and durable, but very clumsy and heavy. Subsequently the china\r\nindustry localized itself until now, while there are many factories\r\nscattered through the country, New Jersey supplies about twenty-four\r\nper cent. of our china, and Ohio forty-two."\r\n\r\n"How did those States happen to elect themselves to make so much\r\nchina?" inquired Theo.\r\n\r\n"Deposits of clay originally governed the matter," replied\r\nMr. Croyden. "Then there was convenient transportation for goods, a\r\nsufficient fuel supply, and an abundance of labor in the vicinity--all\r\nelements in deciding where factories are to be established. Many of\r\nour potteries, however, are not located with these ends in view.\r\nInstead, chance has dropped them down in the most remote spots. Some\r\nare the outgrowth of tiny plants founded long ago before manufacture\r\ndeveloped into the science it has since become."\r\n\r\n"I see."\r\n\r\n"It would be interesting to trace, too, the varieties of ware that\r\ncome from specific districts, for usually there is a reason behind\r\neach type of product. For example in Ohio and West Virginia they have\r\nan abundance of red clay which is used not only to make red\r\nearthenware, but also to coat the outside of casserole serving dishes,\r\nbowls, and tea and coffee pots. You must be familiar with the kind of\r\nthing I mean."\r\n\r\n"Like our hot-water jug at home," cried Theo instantly. "Red and shiny\r\noutside, and white inside."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," nodded Mr. Croyden. "On the other hand many factories make\r\nonly the heavy, indestructible china used in hotels and restaurants.\r\nThis variety is a business in itself. The ware is non-absorbent and is\r\nconsidered very hygienic. Toilet sets as well as dishes are made from\r\nthis especial sort of clay. So you see each plant has its own\r\nparticular specialty which has been decided largely by the native\r\nclays at hand. Here at Trenton we turn out some of the finest\r\nporcelain manufactured in America. In quality it equals the English if\r\nnot the French wares, and it needs only the foreign trade-mark to give\r\nit its deserved prestige. But our people, alas, have not arrived at\r\nthe pitch of patriotism where _Made in America_ has become the popular\r\nslogan. I hope this war may elevate the motto to its rightful place."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps by the time Theo gets to making china things will be\r\ndifferent," ventured Mrs. Croyden.\r\n\r\n"If I thought so I should be very glad," came earnestly from her\r\nhusband. "We have all the necessary clays here in our own soil; the\r\nonly one we need to import is black clay. What is now most necessary\r\nin all our industries is intelligent, trained, ambitious, and\r\nappreciative workers. It is a great reproach to us that here in the\r\nUnited States we have so few schools to educate workmen for their\r\ncraft. Before the war Austria had eight schools to teach\r\npottery-making and Germany twenty-two. Even England had several. And\r\nin the meantime what are we doing here in America? Aside from a few\r\narts-and-crafts potters who of necessity must work on a very limited\r\nscale we are training no pottery-makers. We should establish schools\r\nfor such things if we wish to keep abreast of the time, and compete\r\nwith other nations."\r\n\r\n"Theo can attend to that, too," laughed Mrs. Croyden.\r\n\r\n"We have cut out quite a program for you to work out in the future,\r\nhaven\'t we, lad?" said Mr. Croyden, relapsing into jest. "On the\r\nstrength of it I suggest that you trot along to bed to get rested up\r\nso to be ready to undertake it."\r\n\r\nTheo rose and with a merry good-night they parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE PORCELAIN PILGRIMAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Mr. Croyden\'s plan Theo and his host stepped, the\r\nnext morning, into the waiting motor-car and were whirled to the\r\nporcelain factory.\r\n\r\nAs they rode along the boy remained silent until he saw Mr. Croyden\r\nlay down his paper; then he asked:\r\n\r\n"How many persons in the United States do you suppose are employed at\r\npottery-making, Mr. Croyden?"\r\n\r\n"A great many," was the reply. "Before the war there were about\r\nthirty-three thousand."\r\n\r\nTheo gasped.\r\n\r\n"Why, I had no idea of it!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"It takes a vast number of workmen to manufacture all the clay\r\nproducts turned out in America. Remember dishes and ornaments are not\r\nthe only things made. The industry is classified, and covers white\r\nearthenware, or the better qualities of imitation porcelain used by\r\nthose who cannot afford the real; this branch of the work alone takes\r\nup about forty per cent. of the entire output. Then there is the\r\ngenuine porcelain for table and decorative use; the porcelain\r\nnecessary for electrical purposes; stoneware, or the commoner\r\nhousehold articles found in the kitchen comprising yellow ware,\r\nRockingham ware, and red earthenware; and in addition the great\r\nquantities of sanitary ware for plumbing, drain-pipes, and tiling. Of\r\nall these varieties of porcelain the hardest in quality, and the only\r\none absolutely non-absorbent, is true porcelain. Therefore it is the\r\ncleanest to use. Kaolin being simply decomposed feldspar, and the\r\nglaze applied to it being practically pure feldspar, the product is\r\nmerely a mass of feldspar melted in the fire until all the metals it\r\ncontains except platinum are eliminated. Such a composition is of\r\ncourse far too brittle and delicate for ordinary use even did not its\r\nexpense prohibit our introducing it into the kitchen; but could we\r\nsubstitute it for the cheaper wares it would be much more hygienic--a\r\nfactor persons are liable to forget when purchasing china."\r\n\r\n"I never thought of that," said Theo.\r\n\r\n"The general public does not," replied Mr. Croyden. "Still, now that\r\nI have explained it, you can readily understand it. Another thing that\r\nis not ordinarily considered is that porcelain-making is not as\r\nhealthful an occupation as we wish it were. Those who work in the\r\nglazing department, where powdered flint and lead are used, inhale the\r\ndust and in consequence are sometimes subject to tuberculosis or lead\r\npoisoning just as painters are."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t something be done about it? That seems a dreadful thing."\r\n\r\n"It is a dreadful thing, and we are constantly trying to better\r\nworking conditions and lessen the danger. Yet if you were to examine\r\nthe details of other industries you would find that few of them are\r\nentirely free from undesirable results. Almost every line of\r\nmanufacture has its peculiar risks," returned Mr. Croyden. "I do not\r\nmean for a moment that for that reason we are justified in closing our\r\neyes to the dangers. I merely mean it is a fact. What we are trying\r\nearnestly to do is to find a substitute for lead glaze. Could we\r\nsucceed we should eliminate a great proportion of the trouble."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that would mean finding a different kind of enamel," mused\r\nTheo.\r\n\r\n"Precisely. And you recollect how long it took to discover those\r\nenamels we are now using," answered Mr. Croyden. "It is a good problem\r\nfor some clever man, so bear it in mind. It is just such puzzles as\r\nthese that have raised up our inventors, and those who in one way or\r\nanother have perfected modern industry. Few who have contributed to\r\nthis cause stumbled upon their devices for the labor-saving or\r\nconvenience of mankind. Almost all such discoveries were called forth\r\nby a great need, and were the result of hours and hours of patient\r\nexperiments in laboratories or workshops. Therefore when we pass\r\nthrough a factory and see a process advancing easily from stage to\r\nstage we should never forget those who toiled with brain and hand to\r\nperfect each of its tiny details. Often some very insignificant but\r\nvital part of a machine may represent the lifetime of an unknown\r\nfellow-being who did his part in giving us a more perfect whole."\r\n\r\nTheo glanced up quickly.\r\n\r\n"I thought usually a machine was invented by one person," he said.\r\n\r\n"Occasionally it is," admitted Mr. Croyden. "But more frequently our\r\nmodern machinery is a growth--the product of many minds. Year after\r\nyear defects have been eliminated, and improvements introduced.\r\nMachines every part of which represent the thought of a single\r\nindividual are rare. Most machines are composite photographs of the\r\ningenuity and thought of many inventors."\r\n\r\nThe elder man paused, then added whimsically:\r\n\r\n"Sometimes I feel like taking off my hat to a delicately adjusted and\r\nintricate piece of machinery; it is so human and such a monument\r\nto the men who conceived it."\r\n\r\nThe boy looked grave.\r\n\r\n"If more people felt about machinery and about work as you do,\r\nMr. Croyden, they would have more respect for our industries as well\r\nas for the men who run the machines."\r\n\r\n"It should be so," was Mr. Croyden\'s instant reply. "A factory that\r\nturns out a completed product is like a watch. You know that unless\r\nevery wheel of the watch turns; unless every minute rivet and screw is\r\nin its place and doing its part we get no perfect result. It is just\r\nas important a service to be a wee screw in that organism as to be\r\nsomething larger and more conspicuous. So it is with each workman in\r\na factory. He performs his part--often, alas, a small and dull one\r\ntoo, I am afraid; but viewed from the standpoint of the completed\r\nproduct that man with his humdrum task is as worthy our respect as is\r\nany other member of the working staff. Without somebody to do\r\nprecisely what he is doing we should get no satisfactory result."\r\n\r\n"It is just team-work!" put in Theo.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it--team-work; team-work and nothing else. And just as in\r\nathletics some men better adapted for batting, catching, running, and\r\nkicking are singled out for the posts of fielder, shortstop, or\r\ntackle but contribute equally to the game, so it is with the men in a\r\nfactory. Some day the world is going to accept that creed and pay to\r\nevery human being a living wage; not, perhaps, because what he is\r\ndoing is skilled or difficult; but because it is indispensable and we\r\ncannot do without that particular rung in the labor ladder. Some one\r\nmust fill that post, and he who does it should be respected and\r\ncompensated because he is necessary to civilization and to our\r\nnational prosperity."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden caught his breath and then laughed in confusion.\r\n\r\n"The idea of my giving you a lecture on the labor question, Theo," he\r\nsaid flushing. "I always get hot on the matter, for it is one of my\r\nhobbies. Next time when you hear me getting started just slow me down\r\nand let me cool off. You see it is pretty close to my heart, because\r\nI have been attempting to work out some of its difficult phases here\r\nin my own mills. I am trying to pay to each of my men enough so he can\r\nlive decently and contentedly. It does not seem fair to pay them all\r\nalike, since some are skilful enough to do more work, and work that is\r\nmore difficult than others. But each should be able to live\r\ncomfortably on what he earns. That is my idea of fairness toward the\r\nworking man; and that is the scheme that I am trying to carry out\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nThe car stopped abruptly before a great doorway and Mr. Croyden got\r\nout.\r\n\r\n"Having heard my views you are now to have a chance to see how\r\nimperfectly my dreams have been realized," he said smiling. "I am far\r\nfrom satisfied with present conditions in my factory. But every day\r\nwe are conscientiously trying to make things better, and some day I\r\nhope we shall reach our goal."\r\n\r\nTheo followed him into the hall.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to notice that as the man passed along he exchanged\r\na word or two with every employee he met, calling many of them by\r\nname, and in some cases adding a question concerning the wife or baby\r\nat home. That the men liked their employer there could be no question.\r\nHis manner toward them was one of unaffected interest and\r\nfriendliness, and was entirely free from patronage or condescension.\r\nHis private office, too, was of the simplest type, being neatly but\r\nnot lavishly furnished. Evidently what was good enough for his men was\r\ngood enough for him. There were, however, in the two great windows\r\nseveral boxes of blossoming plants which made the room fragrant.\r\n\r\n"I am very fond of flowers, Theo," explained the mill-owner after he\r\nhad greeted his office force and introduced his guest. "It is my weak\r\nspot--my one big extravagance. This room has just the exposure for\r\nplants and we keep the boxes filled the year round. The boys have\r\nnicknamed the place _the conservatory_ and the jest has stuck until\r\nnobody thinks of calling the place anything else. If you were to ask a\r\nman to come to the office he would have to scratch his head and think;\r\nbut if you told him he was wanted in the conservatory he would land\r\nhere double quick. Isn\'t that so?" concluded Mr. Croyden, turning to\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nEvery one smiled and nodded.\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden hung up his hat and motioning Theo to do the same turned\r\nto encounter a pile of mail that lay on his desk.\r\n\r\n"Bless my soul, this is too bad!" he exclaimed. "Don\'t tell me that\r\nto-day when I had planned to make a tour through the factory Uncle Sam\r\nhas come down on me with all this stuff!"\r\n\r\nHe glanced ruefully at the letter lying topmost on the heap; then at\r\nthe second one.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid these will have to be attended to, Theo," he said with\r\nregret. "Should you be dreadfully disappointed if I were to turn you\r\nover to some one else for a part of your factory pilgrimage?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, sir."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry, but I guess that is what I shall have to do," declared\r\nMr. Croyden. "You can make a start, and later in the morning I will\r\ntry to join you myself."\r\n\r\nHe touched a bell.\r\n\r\n"Send Marwood to me," he said to the boy.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Marwood is a splendidly informed man, Theo; and more than that,\r\nhe is a delightful one. You will enjoy him, and I have a notion he\r\nwill enjoy you. He likes boys--has three of his own, lucky fellow! Ah,\r\nhere he comes now. Mr. Marwood, this is my young friend, Theo Swift of\r\nNew York."\r\n\r\nThe boy put out his hand shyly.\r\n\r\nThe eyes that met his were of the kindliest blue; and the face they\r\nillumined was ruddy, wholesome, and alert.\r\n\r\nInstantly Theo decided that since Mr. Croyden himself could not be his\r\nguide he had at least provided a very pleasant substitute.\r\n\r\n"Theo wants to see everything there is to be seen, Jack," continued\r\nMr. Croyden. "Tote him all about and answer all his questions; and\r\nabove all be thorough, even if you do not cover very much ground\r\nduring the morning. I want the processes carefully explained, for this\r\nboy may be a china-maker himself some day. If I do not join you before\r\nnoontime bring all that is left of him back to the conservatory so I\r\ncan take him to lunch."\r\n\r\nMr. Marwood laughed, and so did Theo.\r\n\r\nThen they passed out.\r\n\r\n"Good luck!" called Mr. Croyden after them as he turned to take up his\r\nmail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nHOW PORCELAIN IS MADE\r\n\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go to the slip-house first where the clay bins are,"\r\nMr. Marwood said to Theo, "that you may start at the very beginning of\r\nthings. That is where the cars run in and unload the raw material."\r\n\r\nThey walked down a long corridor and rang for the elevator.\r\n\r\nAs the car shot to the basement Theo noticed a change in the\r\nappearance of the factory. On every floor they passed there was a hum\r\nof machinery and a glimpse of endless rows of china dishes; they stood\r\non shelves; they covered tables; they were stacked one within another\r\nupon long counters.\r\n\r\n"Some dishes, eh?" Mr. Marwood laughed, reading the boy\'s thought.\r\n\r\n"I never saw so many in my life!"\r\n\r\n"You will see many more before you are through," remarked his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThe elevator brought up with a jerk.\r\n\r\n"Here we are!" exclaimed Mr. Marwood. "At least this is our way into\r\nthe slip-house."\r\n\r\nHe led Theo through a passage and across a court into the adjoining\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nHere a white powder covered everything. Men who hurried by in overalls\r\nand caps were dusty as millers, their hands being coated to the finger\r\ntips with dried clay.\r\n\r\nMr. Marwood stepped forward into the long, cement-floored basement and\r\npointed to the tracks embedded in it.\r\n\r\n"It is on these tracks," he said, "that the cars come in and deposit\r\ntheir contents in the bins. The bins are of a pretty good size, you\r\nsee. They measure about sixteen by thirty-two feet, and each one will\r\nhold eight car-loads of clay. After the different kinds of clay are\r\nunloaded and placed in their respective bins, the proper combination\r\nfor specific varieties of porcelain must be weighed out and mixed in\r\nthe \'blungers,\' as we call the mixing tanks. Now this body formula, or\r\nclay combination, is not entrusted to the ordinary workman. It is\r\nkept secret. Therefore we have on the trucks that carry the clay\r\nbetween the bins and the blungers what we call charging-scales, which\r\nweigh automatically each ingredient in the compound without betraying\r\nit to the loader."\r\n\r\n"That is pretty clever," replied Theo.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is a very ingenious device," Mr. Marwood agreed. "The\r\nblungers in which the clay is mixed are over there. You can see\r\nthem--those great machines near the centre of the floor. They are\r\nheavy steel tanks lined with vitrified brick, and in the middle of\r\neach one is a revolving contrivance, with steel arms and teeth that\r\ngrind the clay up very fine and blend it thoroughly. While it is being\r\nmixed in this way water is added to it, and also a certain amount of\r\npowdered oxide of cobalt to whiten it."\r\n\r\n"Just as we put blueing in clothes," Theo ventured.\r\n\r\nMr. Marwood assented.\r\n\r\n"This cobalt has already been pulverized and sifted most carefully, so\r\nthere will be no particles in it, and so it will readily\r\ndissolve. After the clay mixture has had this mauling--for I can call\r\nit nothing else--the blunged compound, or slip, flows in liquid form\r\ninto the sifter machines where it is strained through silk gauze or\r\nelse a mesh of fine copper wire."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t think you could ever strain such stuff," Theo declared.\r\n\r\n"The sifters do get very hard wear," answered Mr. Marwood, "and are\r\nthe machines most liable to get out of order. They become clogged. Our\r\nsifters are self-cleaning. By that I mean they have an attachment\r\nwhich removes the waste obstructing them. Nevertheless, even with this\r\nimprovement they still bother us at times. If you watch this sifting\r\nmachine carefully you can see that the method is one of sliding the\r\nslip back and forth until it is forced through the straining ducts."\r\n\r\n"And then what becomes of it?"\r\n\r\nThey walked on and stopped before another machine.\r\n\r\n"This is a rough agitator," explained Mr. Marwood. "Into it is pumped\r\nthe liquid slip you just saw strained, and afterward this is brought\r\nin contact with a series of horseshoe magnets which extract from the\r\nmixture every atom of iron."\r\n\r\n"Iron?" repeated Theo.\r\n\r\n"All clay has metals in it," continued Mr. Marwood. "Should you leave\r\nany of these in a pottery clay they would cause you much trouble, for\r\nwhen the ware was fired the metals would melt and discolor your\r\nporcelain. Sometimes this happens with cheap chinas. I dare say you\r\nyourself have seen dishes that are specked with yellow, or have stains\r\nhere and there. Sometimes you can also detect bluish particles. That\r\nmeans the cobalt has not been properly ground or sifted. In less\r\nexpensive wares such defects are frequent. But there is no excuse for\r\nthem when making fine quality porcelains."\r\n\r\nTheo listened attentively.\r\n\r\n"After this iron has been extracted," went on Mr. Marwood, "the slip\r\npasses into smooth agitators, where it is simply kept well stirred in\r\norder that the heavier ingredients in it may not settle to the\r\nbottom. Then the liquid is forced by means of a slip-pump into the\r\nfilter-presses, and it is now that you begin to see an approach to the\r\nclay used for shaping dishes. Up to this point the slip has been only\r\na thick creamy substance. Now the filter-press squeezes this through\r\ncanvas bags until after having been pressed between iron plates you\r\nget your cakes of smoothly mixed clay of about the consistency of\r\nputty. Each cake is of regulation size, and it is supposed to be an\r\ninch-and-a-quarter in thickness, and to weigh forty-two pounds."\r\n\r\n"The clay is now ready for use?" Theo asked.\r\n\r\n"Practically so," was Mr. Marwood\'s reply, "although before it can be\r\nsent to the jiggermen to be modeled it must pass through the pug-mill\r\nto be made more plastic and workable. It is here that it gets its\r\nfinal kneading, all the air bubbles in it being eliminated by a series\r\nof steel knives."\r\n\r\n"I must say it is pretty thoroughly prepared," smiled Theo.\r\n\r\n"It has to be," was Mr. Marwood\'s grave reply. "Each of these details\r\nis an important factor in the making of high grade porcelain, and\r\nshould any of them be omitted we should get no flawless ware. It was\r\nthis infinite care in preparing clay that gave to China, Japan,\r\nFrance, and Germany their perfect results in porcelain-making. If we\r\nwould equal what has been done in the past we must be just as\r\npainstaking, and neglect no detail. As a nation we Americans are far\r\ntoo prone to dash ahead and expect results all in a minute. We do not\r\nlike to mount a stairway step by step; we wish to shoot to the top in\r\nan elevator. Now you cannot manufacture porcelain, or for that matter\r\nanything else, in such a fashion."\r\n\r\n"I know it," replied Theo. "Dad says we hurry so much over the little\r\nthings that we turn out quantities of poorly made goods that are just\r\nhustled through instead of being carefully finished."\r\n\r\n"Your father is right," Mr. Marwood admitted. "It is far too often\r\nquantity and not quality with us. Just so long as men are paid on the\r\npiece-work system we shall not better the condition, either. It\r\nstands to reason that a man who is rushing to make as many objects of\r\none kind as he possibly can in an hour is not going to take the pains\r\nto finish them very carefully. His daily bread depends on his\r\nhurrying. Not a second can be lost. It is an unfortunate labor\r\ncondition, and one that I hope to see remedied some time."\r\n\r\nThe elder man smiled.\r\n\r\n"But we must not take time now to go into labor problems," he\r\nadded. "In our day they are absorbingly interesting and one might\r\nspend hours discussing them. What we all are eager to do is to see\r\nthem readjusted until they shall be fair to all parties."\r\n\r\n"That is what Mr. Croyden wants," put in Theo.\r\n\r\n"I know it is. He is heart and soul in this mill and his\r\nemployees. All the time he is working to improve conditions here. Now\r\nwe must go on, or we shall not get anywhere. To return, then, to our\r\nclay; it is now ready to be carried to the floor above on elevators\r\nand handed over to the potters."\r\n\r\n"Are the ingredients for the glaze prepared in the same way?" Theo\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n"Partially so. The formula for the frit and glaze is also a secret\r\none. Usually the frit, a material similar to glass, is crushed to\r\npowder beneath stone rollers called chasers. Water is then added and\r\nthe compound turned into the grinding-mill where it is ground for an\r\nentire day. Sometimes, however, a different process is preferred and\r\nthe material is put into a kiln and melted instead. In either case it\r\nmust finally be worked into a smooth liquid which can be strained\r\nthrough fine lawn. It is then sent to the agitators and constantly\r\nstirred until it can be pumped into the storage tanks in the\r\ndipping-room."\r\n\r\n"That is just what I wanted to know," said Theo.\r\n\r\n"Any more questions?"\r\n\r\nThe boy shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Not now, thank you."\r\n\r\n"Then as we have finished here shall we go up to the clay-shop?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am ready," Theo affirmed. Then as if confronted by an\r\nafterthought he asked:\r\n\r\n"Is the porcelain made here bone china or ----"\r\n\r\n"Spar?" put in Mr. Marwood as the lad hesitated.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I understand."\r\n\r\n"Feldspar."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then I know," cried Theo. "I did not realize you classified\r\nporcelains as bone or spar."\r\n\r\n"We do," was the quick reply. "Our finest grade of porcelain has\r\nlittle or no phosphate of calcium, or ground bone, in it. But it is in\r\nconsequence very costly, and therefore to meet the demands of the\r\nmarket we also manufacture a porcelain slightly strengthened with a\r\nbone element. Nevertheless this is composed of such a wonderfully\r\nblended body that it is as exquisite as any of the most beautiful\r\nEnglish wares. Personally I prefer it to a pure feldspathic china."\r\n\r\n"My questions are all answered now," laughed Theo. "Shall we go up to\r\nthe clay-shop?"\r\n\r\nThey rang for an elevator and stepped in.\r\n\r\n"Next floor, O\'Keefe," said Mr. Marwood to the operator. "I am going\r\nto teach this lad how to make dishes."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nDISHES, DISHES EVERYWHERE!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Clay," began Mr. Marwood as they went along, "can be shaped in any\r\none of several ways, you know: either by throwing; by turning; by\r\npressing it into hollow moulds; by shaping it by hand over another\r\ntype of mould; by pressing it into flat ware such as platters and\r\nplates; by making it by machinery over moulds as is done by hand; by\r\ncasting it into the desired form; and by compressing it."\r\n\r\nTheo looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n"The list sounds like a long one," Mr. Marwood went on smiling into\r\nthe boy\'s troubled eyes, "but when you understand the processes you\r\nwill find that it is all much simpler than it seems. Before we begin\r\nto investigate any of these methods, however, I want to say just a\r\nword about the moulds over which, or inside of which, the ware is\r\nsometimes shaped; for moulds are a very important feature both of\r\npottery and porcelain-making."\r\n\r\n"What are the moulds made of?" was Theo\'s first question.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you asked, for that is the vital matter," Mr. Marwood\r\nreplied. "Many materials have been tried with varying degrees of\r\nsuccess--plaster-of-Paris, alabaster, steel, gun-metal, and brass. Of\r\ncourse what is necessary is a strong, firm, absorbent material. Clay\r\nmoulds break too easily, and also become saturated with water and lose\r\ntheir shape; metal moulds, on the other hand, while most useful in\r\nmaking wares decorated with fine, raised designs such as the Wedgwood\r\nfigures, fail to seep up the superfluous water. Therefore\r\nplaster-of-Paris has proved the best medium for the purpose. Not only\r\ndoes it retain its form, but it also takes up a certain proportion of\r\nthe moisture from the clay that is moulded inside or outside it."\r\n\r\n"I understand," Theo nodded.\r\n\r\nThe elevator stopped and they stepped out into a vast, well-lighted\r\nroom, gray with clay-dust and thronging with powdery workers. At\r\nbenches, before revolving wheels, and beside turning-lathes toiled\r\nbusy workmen with white, clay-coated hands.\r\n\r\n"We will start our program with the potter\'s wheel, the oldest of\r\npottery modeling devices," said Mr. Marwood. "It is a very simple\r\ncontrivance, you see--just a round piece of board set horizontally on\r\ntop of a revolving spindle. As the disc turns the potter shapes the\r\nclay with his fingers, building it up to the desired height and\r\nmoulding it to conform to the profile, or pattern, he keeps beside\r\nhim. This profile is of wood or steel, and gives the elevation of the\r\nobject in actual size. As he works the potter constantly consults and\r\nmeasures it. Pieces made in this fashion are known as thrown ware. All\r\nthe finest potteries, as well as some of the most expensive\r\nporcelains, are made in this way. However, it is a costly process and\r\nrather slow, for a piece thus shaped must have the entire attention of\r\na single worker. If we were to make all our china by this method I do\r\nnot know where we should bring up. It would take us a decade, and cost\r\nus a great deal of money. But by this means the most artistic results\r\nare obtained. It was in this fashion that the Greeks modeled their\r\nmatchless vases, and you can now see why no two of them were\r\nalike. Each potter put his soul into the thing he was making, and as\r\nhe had endless time at his command he worked with utmost care to\r\nperfect his product. This was all very well in a warm country where\r\nlife was simple; demands few; and where there was not the tension of\r\npresent day living. It was a matter of no concern if the artist made\r\nonly a few such vases in a lifetime. He had the patronage of the rich,\r\nand was sure of being taken care of. But to-day, alas, we face a\r\ndifferent problem."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "IT IS A COSTLY PROCESS, AND RATHER SLOW"]\r\n\r\n"We surely do," agreed Theo.\r\n\r\n"Therefore, here in America only a small proportion of this thrown\r\nware is made. Such art potteries as the Roferno and Sicardo wares,\r\nseen chiefly in private collections and museums, are thrown; also some\r\nof the Grueby, Rookwood, and Cincinnati varieties--all very beautiful\r\nAmerican potteries. In addition to these exquisite home products The\r\nDedham and Paul Revere potteries made near Boston should be mentioned,\r\nfor although of less costly type they are doing much to set a standard\r\nof perfection of form, choiceness of coloring, and fitness of\r\ndesign. All these wares are distinct contributions to the art\r\nworld. Of course certain wares are made by a modification of this\r\nthrowing process. Large pieces, for example, frequently have to be\r\nthrown in several parts, fastened together, and afterward\r\nfinished. Some pieces the thrower shapes over a plaster-of-Paris\r\nmould; and some he shapes inside the mould, reversing the process and\r\npressing the clay against its confining surface. The danger in thrown\r\nware comes from an uneven pressure on the clay resulting in a lack of\r\nsolidity; the pieces are not always equally firm at all points and in\r\nconsequence sometimes crack."\r\n\r\n"Can pieces of any design be thrown?" inquired Theo.\r\n\r\n"No, only round pieces such as cups, mugs, vases, jars, or bowls. In\r\nother words, only circular pieces. Frequently, too, these are only\r\nstarted by the throwing process and are finished by some other means\r\nsuch as turning, for example."\r\n\r\n"What is turning?" asked Theo.\r\n\r\n"Surely you have seen a turning-lathe, Theo," asserted\r\nMr. Marwood. "Here is a turner just opposite us. You will notice he\r\nhas a lathe that goes by steam. The vase on which he is working has\r\npreviously been roughly formed on a jigger--a revolving mould over\r\nwhich a sheet of clay has been pressed and quickly shaped. After such\r\na piece has been dried to a leather hardness the turner takes it in\r\nits crude and uncompleted state and by running his lathe over it\r\nplanes down the surface to a smooth, even thickness. Sometimes, too,\r\nby means of one of these lathes milling-tools are used to cut designs\r\naround the neck or base of the article. The rough edges are then\r\nsponged and before the piece is thoroughly dried handles are put on if\r\ndesired. Here in America turning is the process very generally\r\nemployed for finishing articles begun by the jiggermen."\r\n\r\n"And now about hollow ware--how do they make that?"\r\n\r\n"Hollow ware is pressed by hand," answered Mr. Marwood. "The process\r\nis used for pieces that cannot successfully be made by any other\r\nmeans--such things, for example, as soup-tureens and large covered\r\ndishes. The idea is to press the clay over or into moulds so it will\r\nbe the exact shape required. Of course this necessitates the making of\r\npieces in sections. The two sides of a vase are moulded separately,\r\nfor instance; also the bottom. Then the parts are pressed firmly\r\ntogether and held in place by strings or thongs of leather until\r\nsecurely joined. Afterward the base is inserted in its proper\r\nplace. The inside seams are then leveled and sponged away, and the\r\nmould sent to the drying room. Later it is returned; the outside seams\r\nmoistened and smoothed; the moulded handles put on; and the piece is\r\nready to be decorated and fired. It is a difficult ware to make, for\r\nunless the workmen are skilled at giving the clay an even pressure it\r\nis liable to be thicker in some places than others. Sometimes, too, if\r\nthe seams are not strongly united the article will crack. It demands a\r\nstrong, even touch. Remember that hollow ware is pressed from the\r\noutside; and that flat ware is just the opposite, and is pressed from\r\nthe inside. The top surfaces of such things as plates, platters and\r\ntrays are thus formed, their outer side being shaped by hand or by a\r\njolly, which we shall see presently."\r\n\r\nMr. Marwood passed on through the crowded room until he suddenly\r\npaused beside a workman at another machine.\r\n\r\n"This," explained Theo\'s conductor, "is a jigger. There are two\r\nmachines very commonly used in the United States for shaping the\r\ncheaper wares: one is a jigger, a device of this type; and the other a\r\njolly, an invention very similar in construction but having a tool\r\nattached that forms the outside, or bottom of the piece, the inside of\r\nwhich has previously been shaped by the jigger. You may recall that I\r\nspoke of the jigger; and told you how a revolving mould was inserted\r\ninto it, and how afterward a sheet of clay was laid on the outside of\r\nthis mould and rapidly shaped. The jolly, on the other hand, is used\r\nfor making such things as covers, the top surface of which has already\r\nbeen moulded. The profile set in the jolly-lever makes the\r\nbottom. That, as I told you, is how we get the base of our plates. For\r\ncertain articles the jigger is preferred; for certain others the\r\njolly; but the aim of both is the same, and the workers at the\r\nmachines are all called jiggermen. After an article is taken from the\r\njigger or jolly it is dried and carried to the turning-lathe to have\r\nits surface smoothed and finished."\r\n\r\n"And does it take all these men to run a jigger?" whispered Theo,\r\npointing to the moving figures that hurried to and fro.\r\n\r\n"An organized group of men is employed at each machine," answered\r\nMr. Marwood. "First there is the _clay-carrier_, who must bring the\r\nmaterial to the workmen; then there is a second man called the\r\n_batter-out_ who takes from the carrier the piece of clay cut into the\r\nproper size, and after laying this on a block gives it a strong blow\r\nwith a plaster-of-Paris bat to flatten it for the jiggerman. When\r\nmaking simple objects such a man can give the article quite a start\r\neven with one stroke. You can see that some such beginning must be\r\nmade before the jiggermen can handle the material."\r\n\r\n"How much does the bat weigh?" demanded Theo, instantly interested.\r\n\r\n"About fifteen pounds. It is not very heavy, but the batter wields it\r\nwith considerable force. After the article has thus been\r\napproximately shaped, and the jiggerman has completed it, a\r\nmould-runner must carry the freshly modeled piece to the stove-room to\r\nbe dried; and on his backward trip bring with him two other articles\r\nthat are already dry. These he takes off the moulds, leaving the dry\r\npiece to go to the finisher, and the mould to the batter-out. The\r\nfourth man in the team, or crew, is the _finisher_. His duty is to\r\nsmooth the rough edges of each article with a damp sponge, or a tool\r\nof flat steel. After this process is completed the jiggerman\'s\r\ncrew is through with its part of the work and the goods go to the\r\ngreenroom to be counted, and if perfect accepted by the foreman. Most\r\njiggermen hire their own helpers, as it is simpler for them to do\r\nso. Formerly only round articles were made by the jiggermen--such\r\nthings as cups, plates, bowls, etc. But now oval, as well as round\r\ndishes, can be made on a jigger, although elliptical wares are not\r\nturned out this way to any very great extent, other processes of\r\nshaping being preferred for objects of this type."\r\n\r\n"You spoke, Mr. Marwood, of casting some wares," remarked Theo.\r\n\r\nThe older man smiled.\r\n\r\n"You have a good memory, my boy," he said. "I did mention casting. It\r\nis an independent process, and shapes of great variety can be\r\nfashioned as well as ornamented in this way. By the casting method,\r\ntoo, we are certain of getting articles of uniform thickness. We can\r\neven make very thin objects by this means. But the process is\r\ndestructive of moulds, and therefore has its flaws. The success of the\r\nplan is entirely dependent on the mould\'s absorption of the moisture\r\nin the clay; otherwise the method of casting could not be applied to\r\npotteries or porcelains. As the clay is compressed the water is\r\nsqueezed out of it, and this the mould must take up, or the clay would\r\nnever dry and retain its shape. You can understand that, I think."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"The last of the processes of which I wish to tell you is\r\ndie-pressing. Here we take a very finely ground clay dust; moisten it\r\na little; and fill a die, or steel mould, with it. This die we then\r\nput into a screw, or hydraulic press, and squeeze it under an intense\r\npressure with the result that the piece is shaped very solidly. We use\r\nthis process for making small, complicated objects such as those\r\nemployed for electrical purposes. They are brittle and delicate and\r\nhave to be manufactured with extreme care."\r\n\r\n"Are plumbing supplies made this way?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed! Sanitary pieces are too large to be turned out in such a\r\nfashion. They are made by hand, being first built up inside enormous\r\nmoulds. We can employ only the most skilful workmen on this task\r\nbecause the goods are difficult to make. Such a thing as a porcelain\r\nbath-tub involves a great deal of clay, and therefore were it to be\r\ndamaged we should lose much expensive material." Mr. Marwood took out\r\nhis watch. "Now, there you have all the various ways of shaping clay\r\nware! Its decoration and firing is another story, and far too long a\r\none for us to attack to-day. We must be back at the conservatory at\r\none o\'clock for luncheon. Evidently Mr. Croyden got too deeply snowed\r\nunder to join us, so we shall have to hunt him up. Confess you are\r\nhungry."\r\n\r\nTheo\'s eyes twinkled.\r\n\r\n"I believe I could eat something if I were urged," he admitted.\r\n\r\n"So could I," rejoined Mr. Marwood heartily. "I am starved. We will\r\nfind Mr. Croyden right away. It has been a good morning, hasn\'t it,\r\nTheo?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I\'ve enjoyed it," exclaimed Theo.\r\n\r\n"And I too," agreed the older man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE DECORATION OF CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNext morning bright and early Theo and Mr. Croyden were off to the\r\nfactory, and once more the boy found himself consigned to the care of\r\nMr. Marwood. This was no hardship, however, for the two got on\r\nexcellently together, and Theo was only too glad to co\xc3\xb6perate in any\r\nway he could with Mr. Croyden, whom he knew to be very busy. Therefore\r\nwith this new friend as pilot the pilgrimage through the china works\r\nwas resumed at precisely the point where it had been left the\r\npreceding day.\r\n\r\n"This morning," Mr. Marwood said, "we will turn our attention to the\r\ndecoration of porcelain, which I think you will find quite as\r\ninteresting as was its making. There are almost as many different\r\nprocesses to decorate the ware as there were methods of shaping it."\r\n\r\n"Which one are we to begin with?" questioned Theo eagerly.\r\n\r\n"I think we\'d better start with printed designs. Were you ever in\r\nWashington, Theo?"\r\n\r\nTheo glanced up in surprise at the irrelevance of the inquiry.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Good! What were some of the places you visited?"\r\n\r\nAgain the lad regarded his conductor curiously.\r\n\r\nWhat had his trip to Washington to do with the decoration of china, he\r\nwondered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I went to the Capitol, of course," he answered, "and to the White\r\nHouse, and the Congressional Library; then Dad took me to the\r\nSmithsonian Institute and to the Bureau of Printing and Engraving, and\r\n----"\r\n\r\n"Stop!" cried Mr. Marwood. "I now have found out exactly what I wished\r\nto know. So you have seen bank notes engraved?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"You remember then how the design is cut on a copper or steel plate?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," came promptly from Theo.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad of that, for it is precisely this method we use when\r\nwe print designs on china. The difference is that the designs on our\r\nmoney are printed in ink, and those we transfer to our porcelain are\r\ndone with mineral colors; nor are our plates so finely made. However,\r\nthe idea underlying the processes is identical. The color is applied\r\nto the metal plate, and what is not retained in the engraved\r\ndepressions of the design is carefully scraped away. Then on a kind of\r\npaper expressly prepared for the purpose the picture is made, and\r\nwhile it is moist it is placed against the ware and rubbed in with a\r\npiece of soft flannel. When it is awkward to handle the design as a\r\nwhole it is cut into sections and pieced together on the china\r\nitself."\r\n\r\n"Does one person do the whole thing?"\r\n\r\n"No. It is the duty of one worker to arrange the design and see that\r\nit is in the right place; and the task of the next one to rub it in\r\nwith the flannel and soap. Then after the china has stood for some\r\ntime it is put into water and the paper sticking to it is floated off,\r\nleaving the colored print on the porcelain."\r\n\r\n"Is it done before the ware is fired?" asked Theo.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes it is done on the biscuit ware before it is glazed, and\r\nsometimes on the glaze itself. It all depends on the result the\r\ndecorators wish to obtain. If printed before the porcelain is glazed\r\nit is called under-glaze printed ware, and must be put through a kiln,\r\nwhich will take the oils out of the print; if done on the glaze it is\r\nfired in order to burn the colors in and blend them with the frit."\r\n\r\n"It must be hard always to get the designs where you want them,"\r\nobserved Theo meditatively. "I used to trace patterns at school\r\nsometimes, and often they slipped and made the spacing wrong."\r\n\r\n"That is one of the difficulties our designers encounter, too,"\r\nreplied Mr. Marwood. "Sometimes you will see pieces where the spacing\r\nis not equal, or where a border does not join. That indicates\r\ninaccurate placing of the pattern, or an incorrect estimate of the\r\nspace."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder they get it wrong sometimes," declared Theo. "It isn\'t\r\nso easy. I remember once decorating a card for Mother with some\r\ndecalcomania pictures. It was mighty hard to get them where I wanted\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Decalcomania?" exclaimed Mr. Marwood. "We do that kind of work here\r\ntoo. In fact, a great many of our most beautiful gold borders are\r\ntransferred to the ware by that method. I see you will be quite at\r\nhome, Theo, in our decorating department."\r\n\r\n"I guess you would find me a pretty poor hand at it," laughed the\r\nlad. "My fingers would be all thumbs."\r\n\r\n"Possibly at first. It is very fussy work, I must admit. But the\r\nprocesses are at least easy for you to understand. Another type of\r\ndecoration that will interest you is that employed when we wish to put\r\nbands of solid color around the edges of plates or dishes; also when\r\nwe wish to color their entire surface. We call it ground-laying. Now\r\nhow do you suppose we do that?"\r\n\r\nTheo thought a moment.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t imagine," he said at last. "Of course you could not get the\r\ncolor even with a brush."\r\n\r\n"No," answered Mr. Marwood. "We must first apply to the space we wish\r\nto color a peculiar kind of oil, and afterward dust over this\r\nmoistened surface a finely ground metallic color."\r\n\r\n"Which sticks only to the oiled part!" Theo exclaimed, quickly.\r\n\r\n"You have the idea. Then the superfluous powder is blown off, and when\r\nfired the dust fuses into a solid liquid color, giving us a smoothly\r\nlaid band of red, blue, green, or what you will; or perhaps a dish of\r\nsolid tone if that has been the intent. We do not use this method for\r\nevery type of flat color work, however, because when the powdered\r\ncolor blows about the workers are apt to inhale it, and it is very bad\r\nfor their health. Therefore when it is possible we tint the china by\r\nhand, which can be done if the color is a delicate one and spreads\r\nsmoothly; or we color the clay itself."\r\n\r\nAll this time Theo and Mr. Marwood had been passing through the\r\nfactory and going from one building to another; now they entered the\r\ndecorating department.\r\n\r\n"First I want you to see our air-brush process," Mr. Marwood said.\r\n\r\nHe led the way to an ingenious machine which by means of compressed\r\nair was spraying a fine jet of color over the surface of a porcelain\r\nplate. In some places this color rippled away into a faint tint; in\r\nothers it settled into an area of a deep rich tone. By the aid of\r\nstencils the effect produced was of an exquisitely shaded ware, and\r\nTheo watched the work with delight.\r\n\r\n"I think this air-brush process is the most interesting one I have\r\nseen," the boy cried.\r\n\r\n"It certainly is fascinating to watch, isn\'t it?" agreed\r\nMr. Marwood. "I could stand here all day; but I fear we must go on,\r\nfor we still have much to see. Let us go over to where those girls are\r\ngilding. Some of them are putting a fine gold line on the china, and\r\nothers are doing elaborate designs in gold. The work of the next group\r\nis to gild the handles of cups and dishes."\r\n\r\nThey passed on and stood beside the workers.\r\n\r\n"That does not look like gold!" exclaimed Theo, who viewed in\r\nastonishment the chocolate brown pigment that the girls were using.\r\n\r\nMr. Marwood laughed.\r\n\r\n"All gold looks like that," he said, "before it is fired and\r\nburnished. In fact, all the mineral colors used to decorate glass,\r\npottery, and porcelain look very different when they are put on from\r\nwhat they do after they have been subjected to the heat. That is the\r\nwonderful part of working in oxides and metallic colors. The beautiful\r\nhues we see on china or glass are the result of years of\r\nexperiment. Never forget that. All china decorators have constantly to\r\nbear in mind the effect of a high temperature upon their colors. What\r\nwould be attractive on the unfired clay might emerge from the kiln a\r\nvery ugly product indeed. We must reckon on this fact."\r\n\r\nTheo nodded.\r\n\r\n"It must make the decoration of china a great problem," he said.\r\n\r\n"It does. However, decorators have now learned pretty well what to\r\nexpect. A certain carmine, for example, fires out violet. Many other\r\nshades fire lighter or darker than when applied, and allowance must be\r\nmade for them. The girls who paint china become very skilful in\r\nestimating the changes in colors. These who are working beside us are\r\ndoing the finest sort of porcelain decoration--faces, figures, and\r\nflowers. Those across the aisle are doing a vastly different type of\r\nwork. They are putting coarse, sketchy flowers on the cheaper\r\nware. Some of them, you will observe, are filling in designs that have\r\neither first been printed, or transferred by the decalcomania process,\r\nand must afterward be finished by hand. The girls supply the dabs of\r\ncolor that are needed to complete the pattern."\r\n\r\n"It looks easy."\r\n\r\n"It is not highly skilled work," answered Mr. Marwood. "Some of our\r\nmethods, however, are far less skilled than this one. What would you\r\nsay, for instance, to decorating china with a sponge?"\r\n\r\n"A sponge? Painting with a sponge?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly painting," protested Mr. Marwood. "It is not quite\r\nthat. We do, nevertheless, for our cheapest ware use a fine-grained\r\nsponge cut in the shape of the desired design. This we dip in color\r\nand with it impress a pattern on the clay as we would with a rubber\r\nstamp."\r\n\r\n"I should think you would use a rubber stamp and be done with it,"\r\nreplied Theo.\r\n\r\n"It would not hold the color satisfactorily," explained\r\nMr. Marwood. "But we do use the stamping method for inexpensive gold\r\nware. We also imprint the firm name or trade-mark on the bottom of our\r\nporcelain that way before it is glazed; so we do some stamping, you\r\nsee. Of course stamping is only for the cheap wares. The finest\r\nporcelain is hand-decorated--or at least the major part of it is."\r\n\r\nTheo was silent; then he said:\r\n\r\n"Suppose after all the work of preparing the clay, and shaping and\r\ndecorating it, the piece is broken when the final glaze is put on?"\r\n\r\n"That tragedy sometimes occurs," responded Mr. Marwood. "Often, too, a\r\npiece with many colors and much gold work on it has to be fired\r\nseveral times, and is therefore in jeopardy more than once. In\r\naddition to these risks you must remember the number of hands through\r\nwhich an article passes from the time of its moulding to its final\r\narrival from the glost-kiln. A delicate piece of ware is in peril\r\nevery second. It may be dropped and broken; chipped in handling; its\r\nclay body may crack when exposed to the heat; the colors in the\r\ndecoration may fire out unsatisfactorily; or at the very end there may\r\nbe a defect in the glaze."\r\n\r\n"Great Scott!" gasped Theo. "Why, I never should expect to get a\r\nsingle perfect piece of porcelain."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, we get a great many," smiled Mr. Marwood. "They are\r\nalmost all perfect. The imperfect piece is the exception. But each\r\npiece represents untold care. We sometimes laugh at the old adage of a\r\nbull in the china-shop, but let me assure you that a poor workman can\r\ndo almost as much damage in a porcelain factory."\r\n\r\nMr. Marwood drew out his watch.\r\n\r\n"I believe we shall now have just about time before luncheon to go\r\ndown to the kilns," he observed presently. "Should you like to?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I should."\r\n\r\n"There is not much that we can see, I am afraid. However, we may be\r\nable to catch a glimpse of some of the ware being packed in the\r\nsaggers."\r\n\r\n"What is a sagger?"\r\n\r\n"It is a large clay container in which unfired pottery or porcelain is\r\npacked while it is passing through the firing process. These large\r\nclay vessels have come into general use as the best thing for the\r\npurpose. They stand the heat and at the same time are less liable to\r\nbreak or chip the goods than are containers of any other material. We\r\nmake them ourselves here in the mills. In fact, there is an entire\r\nsection in the clay-shop devoted to nothing but sagger making. Special\r\nmachinery grinds and mixes the clay; special men fashion by hand the\r\ngreat containers; while other men do nothing but work in the wad-mills\r\nwhere rolls of clay to cover the top of the saggers and protect the\r\nunfired ware from smoke are made."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t the clay saggers ever break?" questioned Theo.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes, alas!" admitted Mr. Marwood. "When they do the china in\r\nthem must be rescued from the kilns and put into new saggers. The old\r\nsaggers are then broken up; the clay in them ground and sifted; and\r\nafter being moistened again and mixed with fresh clay other saggers\r\nare modeled."\r\n\r\n"Is the same sort of clay sagger used for the glazed as well as for\r\nthe unglazed wares?"\r\n\r\n"No. For the glazed china we generally use glost saggers that have\r\nbeen covered on the inner side with a coating of enamel."\r\n\r\nAll this time as they talked they had been passing through the mill\r\nand they now entered a low hot building where a series of brick ovens\r\nwith arching tops covered the floor.\r\n\r\n"Here," said Mr. Marwood, "are the firing kilns. After the ware has\r\nbeen brought here in baskets it is very carefully packed in the\r\nsaggers, and the saggers in turn packed in these great brick ovens.\r\nBefore they are put in the kilns have to be cooled so the heat to\r\nwhich the ware is subjected may increase gradually."\r\n\r\n"But it must take forever to pack all the saggers into the kiln,"\r\ndeclared Theo as he viewed in consternation the interior of one of the\r\nwaiting ovens.\r\n\r\n"It takes a long time--about five hours," answered\r\nMr. Marwood. "Porcelain requiring a shorter firing is placed near the\r\nfront of the kiln, so it can be removed if necessary before the rest\r\nis taken out. After the kiln is filled the men brick up the door of\r\nthe oven and start the fire. There the china bakes from forty to sixty\r\nhours. The length of time required depends on the sort of ware being\r\nfired and the temperature of the kiln. Then the opening is unsealed\r\nand the cooling process begins."\r\n\r\n"Do they wait until the saggers and their contents are cold before\r\nthey take them out?" asked Theo.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," was Mr. Marwood\'s reply. "That would take too\r\nlong. Often we are in a hurry to get the goods out and the ovens\r\ncooled for the next lot of porcelain; frequently, too, we want the\r\nware so that we may continue work upon it. Therefore we begin the\r\ndrawing while the oven is still very hot--so hot that the men are\r\nstripped to the waist and wear only overalls, shoes, and thick\r\ngloves. The kiln drawers are never forced to draw out the saggers,\r\nhowever, when they are intensely hot unless they wish to do so. The\r\nlaw protects such workers and specifies at just what degree of\r\ntemperature the work is to become optional. Not only do these men draw\r\nthe ware, but they also empty it from the saggers as well as put it\r\ninto the baskets in which it is carried back to the factory and\r\ninspected, further decorated, or packed for shipping."\r\n\r\nMr. Marwood waited a moment, then added:\r\n\r\n"In some foreign countries a tunnel kiln is used instead of an oven\r\nlike this. It is supposed to require less fuel. It is a long tunnel\r\nwith a track through the centre over which little cars laden with ware\r\nare propelled by machinery. The heat is graded in such a way that it\r\nis most intense in the middle of the kiln. The ware starts at one end\r\nof this tunnel where the temperature is quite low, travels toward the\r\ncentre where the heat is highest, and then comes out at the other end\r\nof the tunnel through a diminishing heat. In this way it cools\r\ngradually. They say, however, that such a method is more successful\r\nfor biscuit (the unglazed china) than for the glost. Here in America\r\nwhere fuel has always been plenty we have stuck to our old-fashioned\r\nbrick ovens in spite of their expense. I am afraid we are not a saving\r\nnation."\r\n\r\n"Father says that after this war is over we shall have to be more\r\nsaving," said Theo.\r\n\r\n"I believe that too," confessed Mr. Marwood. "We never have learned\r\nto figure things down to the lowest cent. We shall have to do it; and\r\nit won\'t hurt us, either. On the contrary, it will be a good\r\nlesson. If each of us would use the least possible material in the\r\nhome, the factory, and the office we should save an amazing amount in\r\na year."\r\n\r\n"I think we ought to do it," affirmed Theo soberly.\r\n\r\n"So do I," rejoined the elder man. "Many manufacturers have already\r\ncome to finding uses for stuff they previously considered waste. They\r\nare using up their by-products, thereby not only enriching themselves\r\nbut giving to the world things that are needed. It is an interesting\r\nand ingenious problem. If we were to employ the same principle\r\neverywhere we should find it well worthy of our brain power. Now shall\r\nwe go back and hunt up Mr. Croyden, or have you still questions to\r\nask?"\r\n\r\n"I have a thousand questions," laughed Theo, "but I don\'t think you\'d\r\nbetter stop now to answer them. Mother says I always do have\r\nquestions; she says no sooner am I through with one than I am ready\r\nwith another."\r\n\r\n"So long as they are intelligent, thoughtful questions I am sure no\r\none minds answering them," Mr. Marwood replied. "How else are we to\r\nlearn? The man who is ashamed to ask questions and confess he does not\r\nknow is worth little in the world. When I spoke of questions, however,\r\nI meant questions about china-making."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" exclaimed Theo. "No, I don\'t think I have any more questions\r\nabout porcelain except to ask you how the glaze is put on the biscuit\r\nware."\r\n\r\n"That certainly is an intelligent question, and one I shall be only\r\ntoo happy to answer," Mr. Marwood said. "We could go down into the\r\ndipping sheds if we had more time. But perhaps since there is not I\r\ncan tell you about them and it will do almost as well. To begin with,\r\nthese sheds have cement floors because the glaze, or slip, spatters\r\nall about and dries upon them. It is therefore practically impossible\r\nto keep wooden floors clean, and we do not wish our workmen to inhale\r\nany more of the dried flint dust than is absolutely necessary."\r\n\r\n"I remember hearing about that," Theo said.\r\n\r\n"The glaze material is ground up while dry and very carefully sifted,"\r\nwent on Mr. Marwood. "Afterward it is mixed with water; colored, if a\r\ntinted glaze is required; and then pumped into tanks where it is kept\r\nwell stirred. When ready the ware is dipped into this glaze and again\r\nfired. This time, however, it is a more difficult matter to pack it\r\ninto the saggers since it must neither touch the sides of the sagger\r\nnor come in contact with any other piece."\r\n\r\n"I never thought of that," owned Theo. "Of course, now that you speak\r\nof it, I can see that when the glaze melts and fuses with the clay it\r\nwould show any mark."\r\n\r\n"Exactly."\r\n\r\n"It must be an awful job to keep each piece separate."\r\n\r\n"It demands extreme care," returned Mr. Marwood. "We use all sorts of\r\nlittle clay devices to support the ware, and keep it in place while it\r\nis in the saggers."\r\n\r\n"Does it take about the same length of time to fire the glazed\r\nporcelain as for the biscuit?" inquired Theo.\r\n\r\n"No. The glost firing usually takes only from twenty-four to\r\nthirty-six hours. Afterward any bits of glaze projecting from the\r\nchina or clinging to it are chipped away with a steel tool and the\r\npiece is examined. If free from flaws it goes either to the packing\r\nroom to be shipped, or back to the factory, in case additional\r\ndecoration is to be put on over the glaze. You may recall that I told\r\nyou that there was an over-glaze and an under-glaze method of\r\ndecoration."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Are your questions answered now?"\r\n\r\n"I believe they are, thank you."\r\n\r\n"And you can now make china without trouble--whatever kind you like\r\nbest?"\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t want to start doing it to-morrow," chuckled Theo. "I\r\nthink I should rather begin on earthenware."\r\n\r\n"You would have to go to some other mills, then," smiled\r\nMr. Marwood. "We make no C. C. ware here."\r\n\r\n"What is C. C. ware?"\r\n\r\n"Ask Mr. Croyden," replied Mr. Marwood. "You see, we have a little\r\njoke about it. His name is Charles Croyden and sometimes in jest we\r\ncall him C. C. Now C. C. ware (an abbreviation for cream-colored) is\r\none of the cheapest of the white earthenwares. When first manufactured\r\nit used to be of a pale yellowish tint, but now it is made in\r\nwhite. Nevertheless its quality has not been materially improved. As\r\nMr. Croyden manufactures only the finer grades of chinas it is a\r\nfavorite quip of ours to call him C. C."\r\n\r\nTheo laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n"I will ask him about the C. C. ware some time," grinned the boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHEO\'S GREAT CHOICE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTheo was as good as his word.\r\n\r\nThat noon as he and Mr. Croyden sat at luncheon he remarked\r\nmischievously:\r\n\r\n"You did not tell me, sir, that you made C. C. ware here."\r\n\r\nMr. Croyden raised his eyes quickly and laughed.\r\n\r\n"So they passed that joke on to you, did they?" he said. "C. C. ware\r\nindeed! You young rascal! I have half a mind now not to send to your\r\nmother that blue vase you admired so much."\r\n\r\n"That blue vase! The one with the girl\'s head on it?" cried Theo. "Are\r\nyou really going to send it to Mother?"\r\n\r\n"If you behave yourself I am," came grimly from the older man. "And if\r\nshe will let you come and visit us again some time."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mother\'ll be crazy over that vase. It is a corker!" exclaimed\r\nTheo. "I can tell her how I saw them making it."\r\n\r\n"You shall carry it back to her then, since you think she will like\r\nit," declared Mr. Croyden. "That is unless you would rather select as\r\na present a piece of C. C. ware," he added humorously.\r\n\r\nTheo smiled and shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Or maybe you would prefer a bit of Samian ware, or jet ware, or\r\nRockingham ware, or yellow ware, or stoneware, or ironstone china, or\r\nwhite granite, or Queen\'s."\r\n\r\n"Jehoshaphat! Are there all those kinds of earthenware?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and that is not the full list, either," replied Mr. Croyden. "We\r\nhave a great many kinds of crockery, and as each variety has its\r\ncheaper as well as its more expensive grades, it makes an almost\r\nendless number of styles. The better types of white earthenware are\r\nmade from carefully selected and well mixed clays, and more nearly\r\napproach porcelain, of which they are imitations. Often their design\r\nis quite good and in consequence they fill a large place in many a\r\nmodest home. Indeed, although we ourselves do not go in for such\r\nchinas we respect a well-made piece of earthenware, for the making of\r\ngood earthenware is an art in itself. Many a rule attends its\r\nsuccessful manufacture. For example, the bottom of a heavy piece must\r\nnot be too thick, or it will crack, because a tremendous strain comes\r\non the base when the clay begins to dry and shrink. The sides pull\r\nfrom every direction, and therefore the bottom must be sufficiently\r\nthin to be elastic, and sufficiently thick to be strong. And that is\r\nonly one of the problems to be faced by pottery and earthenware\r\nmakers. So you see they, as well as we, have troubles."\r\n\r\n"I guess no business is without its troubles," observed Theo.\r\n\r\n"No business that is interesting," answered Mr. Croyden. "It is\r\ngetting the better of such difficulties that gives zest to\r\nmanufacture, making it a constant field for man\'s fertile brain. I\r\nthink the old Italians were right when during the golden days of\r\nVenetian history they recognized the intellectual status of\r\nglass-makers, silk-makers, and the like; and accorded to such men the\r\nsame honors they did to those of noble rank. For, after all, the noble\r\nwas only what chance had made him; while the skilled artisan was what\r\nhe had made himself--a far more creditable thing, to my way of\r\nthinking."\r\n\r\n"And to mine!" agreed Theo.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you feel that way," Mr. Croyden said, "because I am anxious\r\nto have you view this industry not alone from its technical but from\r\nits larger aspect. Did I not believe that I was doing something more\r\nthan just the humdrum task of making dishes I should speedily become\r\ndiscouraged and decide my labor was not worth the strength I am\r\nconstantly putting into it. But every honorable industry is far more\r\nthan that. It is a monument to the men who conceived it and to those\r\nwho little by little developed the wonderful machinery that makes it\r\npossible. Each perfect product it turns out voices the skill,\r\npatience, and faithfulness of scores of workmen. More than that, an\r\nindustry is the weapon of the wage-earner--the means by which he and\r\nhis family are protected from want and unhappiness. Hence every\r\nconscientious manufacturer performs a double service to mankind: he\r\ngives to the world something that it needs, and he furnishes his\r\nfellow-man with a means of livelihood. Regarded in this light it is\r\nno unworthy calling to be a manufacturer."\r\n\r\n"I think both the man at the head of the firm, and the men who share\r\nin the work are doing their bit," put in Theo.\r\n\r\n"The one is dependent on the other," affirmed Mr. Croyden. "It is a\r\nmatter of equality. In fact, it would be hard to tell which of the two\r\nis the more indebted to the other--the employer or the employee. It is\r\nin this spirit that I try to run this great plant. I blunder, it is\r\ntrue; I suppose we all do that. But I sincerely believe labor should\r\nhave an honored place, and so far as I am concerned I give it one. If\r\nI had a boy," Mr. Croyden\'s voice faltered, "If I had a boy," he\r\nrepeated more firmly, "he should be brought up to touch his cap to the\r\nlaborer as well as to the capitalist; and he should be made to feel\r\nthat the trade school is as praiseworthy a place as is the\r\ncollege. The two simply furnish different types of education."\r\n\r\nTheo acquiesced.\r\n\r\n"Your father and I represent these two types," continued\r\nMr. Croyden. "When you grow up you will have to choose which of them\r\nyou will follow. I know you will choose wisely and well. But you must\r\nnever forget that it is the ideal behind what you do that transforms a\r\ncalling from a gray, dead, monotonous vocation into a glowing, living,\r\ninteresting career. You can be a routine doctor, seeing only the dull\r\nround of aches and pains; or you can be the Great Physician who\r\ncontinues God\'s work of healing on the earth. As for the\r\nmanufacturer--in this field, too, you can be the mere money-getter who\r\ncrowds down and ignores those who have helped him to amass his wealth;\r\nor you can be the profit-sharer and co-worker. It all rests with\r\nyourself. It will not be the fault of the task you choose but the\r\nlittleness of your vision if you dwarf your life and find your horizon\r\nsmall."\r\n\r\n  *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nLong afterward Theo Swift remembered those words, and when on his\r\ntwenty-second birthday he entered the Trenton mills, there to be\r\ntrained to assume a partnership in the business, it was with the aim\r\nthat as a captain of industry he would serve his generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stories in this Series are:\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF COTTON\r\nTHE STORY OF GOLD AND SILVER\r\nTHE STORY OF LUMBER\r\nTHE STORY OF WOOL\r\nTHE STORY OF IRON\r\nTHE STORY OF LEATHER\r\nTHE STORY OF GLASS\r\nTHE STORY OF SUGAR\r\nTHE STORY OF SILK\r\nTHE STORY OF PORCELAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STORY OF PORCELAIN***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 19423-8.txt or 19423-8.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/9/4/2/19423\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
