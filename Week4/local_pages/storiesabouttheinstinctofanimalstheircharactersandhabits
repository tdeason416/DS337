Since I last saw you I\r\nhave made an extensive tour, and visited some of the most romantic and\r\npicturesque scenery in England. One day I may give you an account of\r\nwhat I saw, and describe to you the scenes which I visited; but I must\r\ndeny myself this pleasure at present. I promised, at our next meeting,\r\nto tell you some TALES ABOUT THE INSTINCT OF ANIMALS; and I propose to\r\nbegin with the Horse. I like to interest you with those animals with\r\nwhich you are familiar, and to draw out your sympathies towards them.\r\nAfter the STORIES ABOUT DOGS which I told you, some of them exhibiting\r\nthat fine animal in such an amiable and affectionate character, I am\r\nsure it must assume a new interest in your mind. Such instances of\r\nfidelity and attachment could not fail to impress you with a higher\r\nopinion of the animal than you before possessed, and show that kindness\r\nand good treatment even to a brute are not without their reward.\r\n\r\n"I wish to excite the same interest towards the other animals which, I\r\nhope, I have effected towards the Dog. Each, you will find, has been\r\nendowed by its Creator with particular instincts, to fit it for the\r\nstation which it was intended to occupy in the great system of Nature.\r\nSome of them are wild and ferocious, while others are quiet and\r\ninoffensive; the former naturally repel us, while those of the latter\r\nclass as naturally attract our regard, although, properly speaking, each\r\nought equally to interest us, in as far as it fulfils the object of its\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n"But I know you like stories better than lectures, so I will not tire\r\nyou by lecturing, but will at once proceed to tell some stories about\r\nHorses, which I have gathered for you."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, Uncle Thomas, we never feel tired of listening to you; we know\r\nyou have always something curious to tell us."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, Frank, to begin at once with THE HORSE.\r\n\r\n"In several parts of the world there are to be found large herds of wild\r\nhorses. In South America, in particular, the immense plains are\r\ninhabited by them, and, it is said, that so many as ten thousand are\r\nsometimes found in a single herd. These flocks are always preceded by a\r\nleader, who directs their motions; and such is the regularity with which\r\nthey perform their movements, that it seems almost as if they could not\r\nbe surpassed by the best trained cavalry.\r\n\r\n"It is extremely dangerous for travellers to encounter a herd of this\r\ndescription. When they are unaccustomed to the sight of such a mass of\r\ncreatures, they cannot help feeling greatly alarmed at their rapid and\r\napparently irresistible approach. The trampling of the animals sounds\r\nlike the loudest thunder; and such is the rapidity and impetuosity of\r\ntheir advance, that it seems to threaten instant destruction. Suddenly,\r\nhowever, they sometimes stop short, utter a loud and piercing neighing,\r\nand, with a rapid wheel in an opposite course, altogether disappear. On\r\nsuch occasions, however, it requires all the care of the traveller to\r\nprevent his horses from breaking loose, and escaping with the wild\r\nherd.\r\n\r\n"In those countries where horses are so plentiful, the inhabitants do\r\nnot take the trouble to rear them, but, whenever they want one, mount\r\nupon an animal which has been accustomed to the sport, and gallop over\r\nthe plain towards the herd, which is readily found at no great distance.\r\nGradually he approaches some stragglers from the main body, and, having\r\nselected the horse which he wishes to possess, he dexterously throws the\r\n_lasso_ (which is a long rope with a running noose, and which is firmly\r\nfixed to his saddle,) in such a manner as to entangle the animal\'s hind\r\nlegs; and, with a sudden turn of his horse, he pulls it over on its\r\nside. In an instant he jumps off his horse, wraps his _poncho_, or\r\ncloak, round the captive\'s head, forces a bit into its mouth, and straps\r\na saddle upon its back. He then removes the poncho, and the animal\r\nstarts on its feet. With equal quickness the hunter leaps into the\r\nsaddle; and, in spite of the contortions and kickings of his captive,\r\nkeeps his seat, till, having wearied itself out with its vain efforts,\r\nit submits to the discipline of its captor, who seldom fails to reduce\r\nit to complete obedience."\r\n\r\n"That is very dexterous indeed, Uncle Thomas; but surely all horses are\r\nnot originally found in this wild state. I have heard that the Arabians\r\nare famous for rearing horses."\r\n\r\n"Arabia has, for a long time, been the country noted for the symmetry\r\nand speed of its horses: so much attention has been paid to the breeding\r\nof horses in our own country, however, for the race-course as well as\r\nthe hunting-field, that the English horses are now almost unequalled,\r\nboth for speed and endurance.\r\n\r\n"It is little wonder, however, that the Arabian horse should be the most\r\nexcellent, considering the care and attention which it receives, and the\r\nkindness and consideration with which it is treated. One of the best\r\nstories which I ever heard of the love of an Arabian for his steed, is\r\nthat related of an Arab from whom one of our envoys wished to purchase\r\nhis horse.\r\n\r\n"The animal was a bright bay mare, of extraordinary shape and beauty;\r\nand the owner, proud of its appearance and qualities, paraded it before\r\nthe envoy\'s tent until it attracted his attention. On being asked if he\r\nwould sell her, \'What will you give me?\' was the reply. \'That depends\r\nupon her age; I suppose she is past five?\' \'Guess again,\' said he.\r\n\'Four?\' \'Look at her mouth,\' said the Arab, with a smile. On examination\r\nshe was found to be rising three. This, from her size and symmetry,\r\ngreatly enhanced her value. The envoy said, \'I will give you fifty\r\ntomans\' (a coin nearly of the value of a pound sterling). \'A little\r\nmore, if you please,\' said the fellow, somewhat entertained. \'Eighty--a\r\nhundred.\' He shook his head and smiled. The officer at last came to two\r\nhundred tomans. \'Well,\' said the Arab, \'you need not tempt me farther.\r\nYou are a rich elchee (nobleman); you have fine horses, camels, and\r\nmules, and I am told you have loads of silver and gold. Now,\' added he,\r\n\'you want my mare, but you shall not have her for all you have got.\' He\r\nput spurs to his horse, and was soon out of the reach of temptation.\r\n\r\n"Swift as the Arabian horses are, however, they are frequently matched\r\nby those of our own country. I say nothing about _race horses_, because,\r\nthough some of them are recorded to have run at an amazing speed, the\r\neffort is generally continued for but a short time. Here is an instance\r\nof speed in a horse which saved its unworthy master from the punishment\r\ndue to his crime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATCHING WILD HORSES--Page 13.]\r\n\r\n"One morning about four o\'clock a gentleman was stopped, and robbed by a\r\nhighwayman named Nicks, at Gadshill, on the west side of Chatham. He was\r\nmounted on a bay mare of great speed and endurance, and as soon as he\r\nhad accomplished his purpose, he instantly started for Gravesend, where\r\nhe was detained nearly an hour by the difficulty of getting a boat.\r\nHe employed the interval to advantage however in baiting his horse. From\r\nthence he got to Essex and Chelmsford, where he again stopped about half\r\nan hour to refresh his horse. He then went to Braintree, Bocking,\r\nWeathersfield, and over the Downs to Cambridge, and still pursuing the\r\ncross roads, he went by Fenney and Stratford to Huntingdon, where he\r\nagain rested about half an hour. Proceeding now on the north road, and\r\nat a full gallop most of the way, he arrived at York the same afternoon,\r\nput off his boots and riding clothes, and went dressed to the\r\nbowling-green, where, among other promenaders, happened to be the Lord\r\nMayor of the city. He there studied to do something particular, that his\r\nlordship might remember him, and asking what o\'clock it was, the mayor\r\ninformed him that it was a quarter past eight. Notwithstanding all these\r\nprecautions, however, he was discovered, and tried for the robbery; he\r\nrested his defence on the fact of his being at York at such a time. The\r\ngentleman swore positively to the time and place at which the robbery\r\nwas committed, but on the other hand, the proof was equally clear that\r\nthe prisoner was at York at the time specified. The jury acquitted him\r\non the supposed impossibility of his having got so great a distance from\r\nKent by the time he was seen in the bowling-green. Yet he was the\r\nhighwayman."\r\n\r\n"So that he owed his safety to the speed of his horse, Uncle Thomas."\r\n\r\n"He did so, Harry. The horse can on occasion swim about as well as most\r\nanimals, yet it never takes to the water unless urged to do so. There is\r\na story about a horse saving the lives of many persons who had suffered\r\nshipwreck by being driven upon the rocks at the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nwhich, I am sure, will interest you as much for the perseverance and\r\ndocility of the animal, as for the benevolence and intrepidity of its\r\nowner.\r\n\r\n"A violent gale of wind setting in from north and north-west, a vessel\r\nin the roads dragged her anchors, was forced on the rocks, and bilged;\r\nand while the greater part of the crew fell an immediate sacrifice to\r\nthe waves, the remainder were seen from the shore struggling for their\r\nlives, by clinging to the different pieces of the wreck. The sea ran\r\ndreadfully high, and broke over the sailors with such amazing fury, that\r\nno boat whatever could venture off to their assistance. Meanwhile a\r\nplanter, considerably advanced in life, had come from his farm to be a\r\nspectator of the shipwreck; his heart was melted at the sight of the\r\nunhappy seamen, and knowing the bold and enterprizing spirit of his\r\nhorse, and his particular excellence as a swimmer, he instantly\r\ndetermined to make a desperate effort for their deliverance. He\r\nalighted, and blew a little brandy into his horse\'s nostrils, and again\r\nseating himself in the saddle, he instantly pushed into the midst of the\r\nbreakers. At first both disappeared, but it was not long before they\r\nfloated on the surface, and swam up to the wreck; when taking with him\r\ntwo men, each of whom held by one of his boots, he brought them safe to\r\nshore. This perilous expedition he repeated no seldomer than seven\r\ntimes, and saved fourteen lives; but on his return the eighth time, his\r\nhorse being much fatigued, and meeting a most formidable wave, he lost\r\nhis balance, and was overwhelmed in a moment. The horse swam safely to\r\nland, but his gallant rider sank to rise no more."\r\n\r\n"That was very unfortunate, Uncle Thomas. I suppose the planter had been\r\nso fatigued with his previous exertions, that he had not strength to\r\nstruggle with the strong waves."\r\n\r\n"Very likely, indeed, Harry. I dare say the poor animal felt the loss of\r\nhis kind owner very much, for the horse soon becomes attached to his\r\nmaster, and exhibits traits of intelligence and fidelity, certainly not\r\nsurpassed by those of any other animal: for instance,--A gentleman, who\r\nwas one dark night riding home through a wood, had the misfortune to\r\nstrike his head against the branch of a tree, and fell from his horse\r\nstunned by the blow. The noble animal immediately returned to the house\r\nthey had left, which stood about a mile distant. He found the door\r\nclosed,--the family had retired to bed. He pawed at it, however, till\r\none of them, hearing the noise, arose and opened it, and, to his\r\nsurprise, saw the horse of his friend. No sooner was the door opened\r\nthan the horse turned round as if it wished to be followed; and the man,\r\nsuspecting there was something wrong, followed the animal, which led him\r\ndirectly to the spot where its wounded master lay on the ground.\r\n\r\n"There is another story of a somewhat similar description in which a\r\nhorse saved his master from perishing among the snow. It happened in the\r\nNorth of Scotland.\r\n\r\n"A gentleman connected with the Excise was returning home from one of\r\nhis professional journies. His way lay across a range of hills, the road\r\nover which was so blocked up with snow as to leave all trace of it\r\nindiscernible. Uncertain how to proceed, he resolved to trust to his\r\nhorse, and throwing loose the reins, allowed him to choose his course.\r\nThe animal proceeded cautiously, and safely for some time, till coming\r\nto a ravine, horse and rider sunk in a snow-wreath several fathoms deep.\r\n\r\n"Stunned by the suddenness and depth of the descent, the gentleman lay\r\nfor some time insensible. On recovering, he found himself nearly three\r\nyards from the dangerous spot, with his faithful horse standing over him\r\nand licking the snow from his face. He accounts for his extrication, by\r\nsupposing that the bridle must have been attached to his person, but so\r\ncompletely had he lost all sense of consciousness, that beyond the bare\r\nfact as stated, he had no knowledge of the means by which he made so\r\nremarkable an escape."\r\n\r\n"It was at any rate very kind in the horse to clear away the snow, Uncle\r\nThomas."\r\n\r\n"No doubt of it, John, and perhaps he owed his life quite as much to\r\nthis act of kindness as to being pulled out of the ravine. He might have\r\nbeen as certainly choked by the snow out of it as in it. Sometimes the\r\nhorse becomes much attached to the animals with which it associates, and\r\nits feelings of friendship are as powererful as those of the dog. A\r\ngentleman of Bristol had a greyhound which slept in the same stable, and\r\ncontracted a very great intimacy with a fine hunter. When the dog was\r\ntaken out, the horse neighed wistfully after him, and seemed to long for\r\nits return; he welcomed him home with a neigh; the greyhound ran up to\r\nthe horse and licked him; the horse, in return, scratched the\r\ngreyhound\'s back with his teeth. On one occasion, when the groom had the\r\npair out for exercise, a large dog attacked the greyhound, bore him to\r\nthe ground, and seemed likely to worry him, when the horse threw back\r\nhis ears, rushed forward, seized the strange dog by the back, and flung\r\nhim to a distance, which so terrified the aggressor, that he at once\r\ndesisted and made off."\r\n\r\n"That was very kind, Uncle Thomas. I like to hear of such instances of\r\nfriendship between animals."\r\n\r\n"Such a docile animal as the horse can readily be trained to particular\r\nhabits, and does not readily forget them, however disreputable. There is\r\nan odd story to illustrate this.\r\n\r\n"About the middle of last century, a Scottish lawyer had occasion to\r\nvisit the metropolis. At that period such journies were usually\r\nperformed on horseback, and the traveller might either ride post, or, if\r\nwilling to travel economically, he bought a horse, and sold him at the\r\nend of his journey. The lawyer had chosen the latter mode of travelling,\r\nand sold the animal on which he rode from Scotland as soon as he arrived\r\nin London. With a view to his return, he went to Smithfield to purchase\r\na horse. About dusk a handsome one was offered, at so cheap a rate that\r\nhe suspected the soundness of the animal, but being able to discover no\r\nblemish, he became the purchaser.\r\n\r\n"Next morning, he set out on his journey, the horse had excellent paces,\r\nand our traveller, while riding over the few first miles, where the road\r\nwas well frequented, did not fail to congratulate himself on his good\r\nfortune, which had led him to make so advantageous a bargain.\r\n\r\n"They arrived at last at Finchley Common, and at a place where the road\r\nran down a slight eminence, and up another, the lawyer met a clergyman\r\ndriving a one-horse chaise. There was nobody within sight, and the horse\r\nby his conduct instantly discovered the profession of his former owner.\r\nInstead of pursuing his journey, he ran close up to the chaise and stopt\r\nit, having no doubt but his rider would embrace so fair an opportunity\r\nof exercising his calling. The clergyman seemed of the same opinion,\r\nproduced his purse unasked, and assured the astonished lawyer that it\r\nwas quite unnecessary to draw his pistol, as he did not intend to offer\r\nany resistance. The traveller rallied his horse, and with many apologies\r\nto the gentleman he had so innocently and unwillingly affrighted,\r\npursued his journey.\r\n\r\n"They had not proceeded far when the horse again made the same\r\nsuspicious approach to a coach, from the window of which a blunderbuss\r\nwas levelled, with denunciations of death and destruction to the hapless\r\nand perplexed rider. In short, after his life had been once or twice\r\nendangered by the suspicions to which the conduct of his horse gave\r\nrise, and his liberty as often threatened by the peace-officers, who\r\nwere disposed to apprehend him as a notorious highwayman, the former\r\nowner of the horse, he was obliged to part with the inauspicious animal\r\nfor a trifle, and to purchase one less beautiful, but not accustomed to\r\nsuch dangerous habits."\r\n\r\n"Capital, Uncle Thomas! I should have liked to have seen the perplexed\r\nlook of the poor lawyer, when he saw the blunderbuss make its appearance\r\nat the carriage window!"\r\n\r\n"There is one other story about the horse, showing his love for his\r\nmaster, and the gentleness of his character. A horse which was\r\nremarkable for its antipathy to strangers, one evening, while bearing\r\nhis master home from a jovial meeting, became disburthened of his rider,\r\nwho, having indulged rather freely, soon went to sleep on the ground.\r\nThe horse, however, did not scamper off, but kept faithful watch by his\r\nprostrate master till the morning, when the two were perceived about\r\nsunrise by some labourers. They approached the gentleman, with the\r\nintention of replacing him on his saddle, but every attempt on their\r\npart was resolutely opposed by the grinning teeth and ready heels of the\r\nhorse, which would neither allow them to touch his master, nor suffer\r\nhimself to be seized till the gentleman himself awoke from his sleep.\r\nThe same horse, among other bad propensities, constantly resented the\r\nattempts of the groom to trim its fetlocks. This circumstance happened\r\nto be mentioned by its owner in conversation, in the presence of his\r\nyoungest child, a very few years old, when he defied any man to perform\r\nthe operation singly. The father next day, in passing through the\r\nstable-yard, beheld with the utmost distress, the infant employed with a\r\npair of scissors in clipping the fetlocks of the hind-legs of this\r\nvicious hunter--an operation which had been always hitherto performed\r\nwith great danger even by a number of men. Instead, however, of\r\nexhibiting his usual vicious disposition, the horse, in the present\r\ncase, was looking with the greatest complacency on the little groom, who\r\nsoon after, to the very great relief of his father, walked off unhurt."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     Uncle Thomas tells about the Beaver, and the Singular Manner in\r\n     which it Constructs a Dam to confine the Waters of the River; and\r\n     about the Hut which it builds for its Habitation. He tells also\r\n     about the Curious Nests of the Sociable Grosbeak; and gives a Long\r\n     and Entertaining Account of the White Ant of Africa; its\r\n     Extraordinary Nest; and the Important Part which it acts in the\r\n     Economy of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Boys! I am going to tell you about a very singular animal\r\nto-night--singular both in its conformation and its habits. I allude to\r\nthe Beaver."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we shall be so glad to hear about the Beaver, Uncle Thomas. I have\r\nsometimes wondered what sort of an animal it is. It is of its skin that\r\nhats are made--is it not?"\r\n\r\n"It is so, Harry--at least it is of the fur with which its skin is\r\ncovered. I must tell you about the manufacture of hats at some other\r\ntime. Our business at present is with the Beaver itself. I think we\r\nshall get on better by confining our attention to the animal now, and\r\nexamine into its habits and instincts."\r\n\r\n"Very well, Uncle Thomas, we are all attention."\r\n\r\n"The Beaver, which is now only to be found in the more inaccessible\r\nparts of America, and the more northern countries of Europe, affords a\r\ncurious instance of what may be called a compound structure. It has the\r\nfore-feet of a land animal, and the hind ones of an aquatic one--the\r\nlatter only being webbed. Its tail is covered with scales like a fish,\r\nand serves to direct its course in the water, in which it spends much of\r\nits time.\r\n\r\n"On the rivers where they abound, they form societies sometimes\r\nconsisting of upwards of two hundred. They begin to assemble about the\r\nmonths of June and July, and generally choose for the place of their\r\nfuture habitation the side of some lake or river. If a lake, in which\r\nthe water is always pretty nearly of a uniform level, they dispense with\r\nbuilding a dam, but if the place they fix upon be the banks of a river,\r\nthey immediately set about constructing a pier or dam, to confine the\r\nwater, so that they may always have a good supply."\r\n\r\n"That is an instance of very singular sagacity Uncle Thomas. I suppose\r\nit is their instinct which teaches them to act in this manner."\r\n\r\n"You are right, Frank. Well, the mode in which they set about\r\nconstructing the dam is this: having fixed upon the spot, they go into\r\nthe neighbouring forest, and cut quantities of the smaller branches of\r\ntrees, which they forthwith convey to the place selected, and having\r\nfixed them in the earth, interweave them strongly and closely, filling\r\nup all the crevices with mud and stones, so as soon to make a most\r\ncompact construction."\r\n\r\n"That must be a work of very great labour, Uncle Thomas."\r\n\r\n"The labour is very considerable, Boys; but the power which, for want of\r\na better name, we call Instinct, comes wonderfully to their aid. For\r\ninstance, it has been observed that they seek all the branches which\r\nthey want on the banks of the river, higher up than their construction,\r\nso that having once got them conveyed to the water, they are easily\r\nfloated to it."\r\n\r\n"Very good, Uncle Thomas."\r\n\r\n"When the beavers have finished the dam, they then proceed to construct\r\na house for themselves. First they dig a foundation of greater or less\r\ncapacity, in proportion to the number of their society. They then form\r\nthe walls of earth and stones, mixed with billets of wood crossing each\r\nother, and thus tying the fabric together just in the same way as you\r\nsometimes see masons do in building human dwellings. Their huts are\r\ngenerally of a circular form, something like the figure of a haycock,\r\nand they have usually several entrances--one or more opening into the\r\nriver or lake, below the surface of the water, and one communicating\r\nwith any bushes and brushwood which may be at hand, so as to afford the\r\nmeans of escape in case of attack either on the land or water side."\r\n\r\n"They must be pretty safe then, Uncle Thomas, since they can so readily\r\nescape."\r\n\r\n"They are pretty secure so long as they have only unreasoning animals to\r\ncontend with, Frank; but when man, armed with the power, before which\r\nmere Instinct must at all times bow, attacks them, they are very easily\r\novercome. Shall I tell you how the hunters capture them?"\r\n\r\n"If you please, Uncle Thomas."\r\n\r\n"Very well. I must first tell you that the skin of the Beaver is most\r\nvaluable during winter, as the fur is then thicker and finer than during\r\nthe summer. They are therefore very little if at all molested during\r\nsummer by the hunters. When winter sets in, however, and the lakes and\r\nrivers are frozen over, a party of hunters set out to seek for the\r\nbeaver colonies, and, having found them, they make a number of holes in\r\nthe ice. Having done this and concerted measures, they break down the\r\nhuts, and the animals instantly get into the water as a place of safety.\r\nAs they cannot remain long under water, however, they have soon occasion\r\nto come to the surface to breathe, and of course make for the holes\r\nwhich the hunters have formed in the ice, when the latter, who are\r\nwaiting in readiness, knock them on the head."\r\n\r\n"But, Uncle Thomas, don\'t you think it is very cruel to kill the beaver\r\nso? I believe it feeds entirely on vegetables, and does no harm to any\r\none."\r\n\r\n"You might say the same, John, of the sheep on the downs; the one is not\r\nmore cruel than the other: both are useful to man, and furnish him with\r\nfood as well as raiment, and both were, of course, included in the\r\n\'dominion\' which God originally gave to man \'over the beasts of the\r\nfield.\'"\r\n\r\n"Is the beaver used for food, then, Uncle Thomas?"\r\n\r\n"It is, and except during a small part of the year, when it feeds on the\r\nroot of the water-lily, which communicates a peculiar flavour to the\r\nflesh of the animal, it is said to be very palatable. It is, however,\r\nprincipally for its fur that it is hunted; the skin, even, is of little\r\nvalue, being coarser and looser in texture, and of course less\r\napplicable to general uses, than that of many other animals. I dare say\r\nyou have often seen it made into gloves.\r\n\r\n"I will now read to you an account of a tame beaver, which its owner,\r\nMr. Broderip, communicated to \'the Gardens and Menagerie of the\r\nZoological Society.\'\r\n\r\n"The animal arrived in this country in the winter of 1825, very young,\r\nbeing small and woolly, and without the covering of long hair, which\r\nmarks the adult beaver. It was the sole survivor of five or six which\r\nwere shipped at the same time, and was in a very pitiable condition.\r\nGood treatment soon made it familiar. When called by its name, \'Binny,\'\r\nit generally answered with a little cry, and came to its owner. The\r\nhearth rug was its favourite haunt, and thereon it would lie, stretched\r\nout, sometimes on its back, and sometimes flat on its belly, but always\r\nnear its master. The building instinct showed itself immediately after\r\nit was let out of its cage, and materials were placed in its way,--and\r\nthis, before it had been a week in its new quarters. Its strength, even\r\nbefore it was half grown, was great. It would drag along a large\r\nsweeping-brush, or a warming-pan, grasping the handle with its teeth, so\r\nthat the load came over its shoulder, and advancing in an oblique\r\ndirection, till it arrived at the point where it wished to place it. The\r\nlong and large materials were always taken first, and two of the longest\r\nwere generally laid crosswise, with one of the ends of each touching the\r\nwall, and the other ends projecting out into the room. The area formed\r\nby the crossed brushes and the wall he would fill up with hand-brushes,\r\nrush baskets, books, boots, sticks, cloths, dried turf, or any thing\r\nportable. As the work grew high, he supported himself on his tail, which\r\npropped him up admirably: and he would often, after laying on one of his\r\nbuilding materials, sit up over against it, apparently to consider his\r\nwork, or, as the country people say, \'judge it.\' This pause was\r\nsometimes followed by changing the position of the material \'judged,\'\r\nand sometimes it was left in its place. After he had piled up his\r\nmaterials in one part of the room (for he generally chose the same\r\nplace), he proceeded to wall up the space between the feet of a chest of\r\ndrawers, which stood at a little distance from it, high enough on its\r\nlegs to make the bottom a roof for him; using for this purpose dried\r\nturf and sticks, which he laid very even, and filling up the interstices\r\nwith bits of coal, hay, cloth, or any thing he could pick up. This last\r\nplace he seemed to appropriate for his dwelling; the former work seemed\r\nto be intended for a dam. When he had walled up the space between the\r\nfeet of the chest of drawers, he proceeded to carry in sticks, cloths,\r\nhay, cotton, and to make a nest; and, when he had done, he would sit up\r\nunder the drawers, and comb himself with the nails of his hind feet. In\r\nthis operation, that which appeared at first to be a malformation, was\r\nshown to be a beautiful adaptation to the necessities of the animal. The\r\nhuge webbed hind feet often turn in, so as to give the appearance of\r\ndeformities; but if the toes were straight, instead of being incurved,\r\nthe animal could not use them for the purpose of keeping its fur in\r\norder, and cleansing it from dirt and moisture.\r\n\r\n"Binny generally carried small and light articles between his right fore\r\nleg and his chin, walking on the other three legs; and large masses,\r\nwhich he could not grasp readily with his teeth, he pushed forwards,\r\nleaning against them with his right fore paw and his chin. He never\r\ncarried anything on his tail, which he liked to dip in water, but he was\r\nnot fond of plunging in his whole body. If his tail was kept moist, he\r\nnever cared to drink, but, if it was kept dry, it became hot, and the\r\nanimal appeared distressed, and would drink a great deal. It is not\r\nimpossible that the tail may have the power of absorbing water, like the\r\nskin of frogs, though it must be owned that the scaly integument which\r\ninvests that member has not much of the character which generally\r\nbelongs to absorbing surfaces.\r\n\r\n"Bread, and bread and milk, and sugar, formed the principal part of\r\nBinny\'s food; but he was very fond of succulent fruits and roots. He was\r\na most entertaining creature; and some highly comic scenes occurred\r\nbetween the worthy, but slow beaver, and a light and airy macauco, that\r\nwas kept in the same apartment."\r\n\r\n"I think I have read, Uncle, that beavers use their tails as trowels to\r\nplaster their houses, and as sledges to carry the materials to build\r\nhuts."\r\n\r\n"I dare say, you have, Frank; but I believe such stories are mere\r\nfables, told by the ignorant to excite wonder in the minds of the\r\ncredulous. No such operations have been observed by the most accurate\r\nobservers of the animal\'s habits. The wonderful instinct which they\r\ndisplay in building their houses is quite sufficient to excite our\r\nadmiration, without having recourse to false and exaggerated\r\nstatements."\r\n\r\n"The building instinct of the beaver is very curious, Uncle Thomas. Is\r\nit displayed by any other animal?"\r\n\r\n"All animals exhibit it more or less, Harry, and birds in particular, in\r\nthe construction of their nests, some of which are very curious indeed;\r\nperhaps one of the most striking instances is that of the Sociable\r\nGrosbeak, a bird which is found in the interior of the Cape of Good\r\nHope. They construct their nests under one roof, which they form of the\r\nbranches of some tall and wide-spreading tree, thatching it all over, as\r\nit were, with a species of grass.\r\n\r\n"When they have got their habitation fairly covered in they lay out the\r\ninside, according to some travellers, into regular streets, with nests\r\non both sides, about a couple of inches distant from each other. In one\r\nrespect, however, they differ from the beaver, they do not appear to lay\r\nup a common store of food, the nature of the climate not rendering such\r\na precaution necessary.\r\n\r\n"Here is the account of one of these erections furnished by a gentleman\r\nwho minutely examined the structure.\r\n\r\n"I observed on the way a tree with an enormous nest of those birds, to\r\nwhich I have given the appellation of republicans; and, as soon as I\r\narrived at my camp, I despatched a few men, with a waggon, to bring it\r\nto me, that I might open the hive, and examine the structure in its\r\nminutest parts. When it arrived, I cut it in pieces with a hatchet, and\r\nfound that the chief portion of the structure consisted of a mass of\r\nBoshman\'s grass, without any mixture, but so compact and firmly basketed\r\ntogether as to be impenetrable to the rain. This is the commencement of\r\nthe structure; and each bird builds its particular nest under this\r\ncanopy. But the nests are formed only beneath the eaves of the canopy,\r\nthe upper surface remaining void, without, however, being useless; for,\r\nas it has a projecting rim, and is a little inclined, it serves to let\r\nthe rain-water run off, and preserves each little dwelling from the\r\nrain. Figure to yourself a huge irregular sloping roof, and all the\r\neaves of which are completely covered with nests, crowded one against\r\nanother, and you will have a tolerably accurate idea of these singular\r\nedifices.\r\n\r\n"Each individual nest is three or four inches in diameter, which is\r\nsufficient for the bird. But as they are all in contact with one\r\nanother, around the eaves, they appear to the eye to form but one\r\nbuilding, and are distinguishable from each other only by a little\r\nexternal aperture, which serves as an entrance to the nest; and even\r\nthis is sometimes common to three different nests, one of which is\r\nsituated at the bottom, and the other two at the sides. According to\r\nPaterson, the number of cells increasing in proportion to the increase\r\nof inhabitants, the old ones become \'streets of communication, formed by\r\nline and level.\' No doubt, as the republic increases, the cells must be\r\nmultiplied also; but it is easy to imagine that, as the augmentation can\r\ntake place only at the surface, the new buildings will necessarily cover\r\nthe old ones, which must therefore be abandoned.\r\n\r\n"Should these even, contrary to all probability, be able to subsist, it\r\nmay be presumed that the depth of their situation, by preventing any\r\ncirculation and renewal of the air, would render them so extremely hot\r\nas to be uninhabitable. But while they thus become useless, they would\r\nremain what they were before, real nests, and change neither into\r\nstreets nor sleeping-rooms.\r\n\r\n"The large nest which I examined was one of the most considerable which\r\nI had seen any where on my journey, and contained three hundred and\r\ntwenty inhabited cells."\r\n\r\n"Well, Uncle Thomas, that is very curious; I don\'t know which most to\r\nadmire. I rather incline to the beaver however, because of the winter\r\nstore of food which he lays up."\r\n\r\n"There is another animal which displays the building instinct so\r\nremarkably, that I must tell you something about it before we part."\r\n\r\n"Which is it, Uncle Thomas?"\r\n\r\n"It is the white ant of Africa; it is a little animal, scarcely, if at\r\nall, exceeding in size those of our own country, yet they construct\r\nlarge nests of a conical or sugar loaf shape, sometimes from ten to\r\ntwelve feet in height; and one species builds them so strong and\r\ncompact, that even when they are raised to little more than half their\r\nheight, the wild-bulls of the country use them as sentinel posts to\r\nwatch over the safety of the herd which grazes below.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Smeathman, a naturalist fully capable to do justice to the nature\r\nof these erections, states, that on one occasion he and four men stood\r\non the top of one of them. So you may guess how strong they are."\r\n\r\n"Of what are they made, Uncle Thomas? They must be very curious\r\nstructures. How very different from the ant hills of England!"\r\n\r\n"Very different, indeed, John. They are made of clay and sand, and as in\r\nsuch a luxuriant climate they soon become coated over with grass, they\r\nquickly assume the appearance of hay-cocks. They are indeed very\r\nremarkable structures, whether we consider them externally or\r\ninternally, and are said to excel those of the beaver and the bee in the\r\nsame proportion as the inhabitants of the most polished European nation\r\nexcel the huts of the rude inhabitants of the country where the\r\n_Termites_ or white ants abound; while in regard to mere size, Mr.\r\nSmeathman calculates that, supposing a man\'s ordinary height to be six\r\nfeet, the nests of these creatures may be considered, relative to their\r\nsize and that of man\'s, as being raised to four times the height of the\r\nlargest Egyptian pyramids."\r\n\r\n"That is enormous, Uncle Thomas?"\r\n\r\n"It is indeed, Frank; but strange though it is, the interior of the nest\r\nis even more remarkable, many parts of its construction falling little\r\nshort of human ingenuity. I need not attempt to describe all its\r\narrangements, which, without a plan, would be nearly unintelligible; but\r\nthere is one device so admirable that I must point it out to you. The\r\nnest is formed of two floors, as it were, and all round the walls are\r\ngalleries perforated in various winding directions, and leading to the\r\nstore-houses of the colony, or to the nurseries where the eggs are\r\ndeposited. As it is sometimes convenient to reach the galleries which\r\nopen from the upper roof without threading all the intricacies of these\r\nwinding passages, they construct bridges of a single arch, and thus at\r\nonce reach the upper roof, from which these diverge. They are thus also\r\nsaved much labour, in transporting provisions, and in bearing the eggs\r\nto the places where they remain till they are hatched."\r\n\r\n"That is indeed admirable, Uncle Thomas; they must be very curious\r\nanimals."\r\n\r\n"They are divided into various classes, in the same way as bees; choosing\r\na queen, and some of them acting as workers, &c. But the white ants have\r\na class to which there is nothing similar among any other race of\r\ninsects. These are what Smeathman calls soldiers, from the duties which\r\nthey perform. They are much less numerous than the workers, being\r\nsomewhat in the proportion of one in one hundred. The duty of the\r\nsoldier-insects is to protect the nest when it is attacked. They are\r\nfurnished with long and slender jaws, and when enraged bite very\r\nfiercely, and sometimes even drive off the negroes who may have attacked\r\nthem, and even white people suffer severely,--the bite bleeding profusely\r\neven through the stocking. Some one who observed the colony alarmed, by\r\nhaving part of the nest broken down, gives the following account of the\r\nsubsequent operations. One of the soldiers first makes his appearance, as\r\nif to see if the enemy be gone, and to learn whence the attack proceeds.\r\nBy and by two or three others make their appearance, and soon afterwards\r\na numerous body rushes out, which increases in number so long as the\r\nattack is continued. They are at this time in a state of the most violent\r\nagitation; some employed in beating upon the building with their\r\nmandibles, so as to make a noise which may be distinctly heard at the\r\ndistance of three or four feet. Whenever the attack is discontinued, the\r\nsoldiers retire first, and are quickly followed by the labourers, which\r\nhasten in various directions towards the breach, each with a burden of\r\nmortar ready tempered, and thus they soon repair the chasm. Besides the\r\nduty of protecting the colony, the soldiers seem to act as overseers of\r\nthe work, one being generally in attendance on every six or eight\r\nhundred; and another, who may be looked upon as commander in chief, takes\r\nup his station close to the wall which they are repairing, and frequently\r\nrepeats the beating which I just mentioned, which is instantly answered\r\nby a loud hiss from all the labourers within the dome,--those at work\r\nlabouring with redoubled energy."\r\n\r\n"But, Uncle Thomas, what can be the use of such animals as white ants? I\r\nreally cannot see what use they are for."\r\n\r\n"Well, John, I confess I do not much wonder at your question, though, in\r\nputting it, you have forgotten that God makes nothing in vain. Mr.\r\nSmeathman, who tells us so much about these curious animals, has\r\nanswered you by anticipation; and his answer is in such a spirit that I\r\ncannot do better than read it to you.\r\n\r\n"It may appear surprising how a Being perfectly good should have created\r\nanimals which seem to serve no other end but to spread destruction and\r\ndesolation wherever they go. But let us be cautious in suspecting any\r\nimperfection in the FATHER OF THE UNIVERSE. What at first sight may seem\r\nonly productive of mischief, will, upon mature deliberation, be found\r\nworthy of that wisdom which planned the most beautiful parts of the\r\nworld. Many poisons are valuable medicines, Storms are beneficial; and\r\ndiseases often promote life. These _Termites_ are indeed frequently\r\npernicious to mankind, but they are also very useful and even necessary.\r\nOne valuable purpose which they serve is, to destroy decayed trees and\r\nother substances which, if left on the surface of the ground in hot\r\nclimates, would in a short time pollute the air. In this respect they\r\nresemble very much the common flies, which are regarded by mankind in\r\ngeneral as noxious and, albeit, as useless beings in creation. But this\r\nis certainly for want of consideration. There are not probably in all\r\nnature animals of more importance, and it would not be difficult to\r\nprove that we should feel the want of one or two large quadrupeds much\r\nless than of one or two species of these despicable-looking insects.\r\nMankind in general are sensible that nothing is more disagreeable or\r\nmore pestiferous than putrid substances; and it is apparent to all who\r\nhave made observation, that those little insects contribute more to the\r\nquick dissolution and dispersion of putrescent matter than any other.\r\nThey are so necessary in all hot climates, that ever in the open fields\r\na dead animal or small putrid substance cannot be laid upon the ground\r\ntwo minutes before it will be covered with flies and their maggots,\r\nwhich, instantly entering, quickly devour one part, and perforating the\r\nrest in various directions, expose the whole to be much sooner\r\ndecomposed by the elements. Thus it is with the _Termites_. The rapid\r\nvegetation in hot climates, of which no idea can be formed by any thing\r\nto be seen in this, is equalled by as great a degree of destruction\r\nfrom natural as well as accidental causes. It seems apparent that when\r\nanything whatever has arrived at its last degree of perfection, the\r\nCreator has decreed that it shall be wholly destroyed as soon as\r\npossible, that the face of nature may be speedily adorned with fresh\r\nproductions in the bloom of spring, or the pride of summer; so when\r\ntrees and even woods are in part destroyed by tornadoes or fire, it is\r\nwonderful to observe how many agents are employed in hastening the total\r\ndissolution of the rest. But in hot climates there are none so expert,\r\nor who do their business so expeditiously and effectually, as these\r\ninsects, which in a few weeks destroy and carry away the bodies of large\r\ntrees, without leaving a particle behind; thus clearing the place for\r\nother vegetables which soon fill up every vacancy: and in places where\r\ntwo or three years before there has been a populous town, if the\r\ninhabitants, as is frequently the case, have chosen to abandon it,\r\nthere shall be a very thick wood, and not a vestige of a post to be\r\nseen, unless the wood has been of a species which from its hardness is\r\ncalled iron wood."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Uncle Thomas. I see, I was quite wrong in supposing that the\r\nants are of no use. I really did not imagine that they could have been\r\nso serviceable."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     Uncle Thomas describes the Manner in which Wild Elephants are\r\n     caught, and relates some Curious Stories of the Cunning, Affection,\r\n     and Intelligence of the Elephant.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Well, Boys, you are once more welcome!--I am going to tell you some\r\nstories about the Elephant to-night, which I hope will interest you\r\nquite as much as those which I told you about the dog. Next to the dog\r\nthe elephant is one of the most intelligent animals; some of his\r\nactions, indeed, seem to be rather the result of reason than mere\r\ninstinct. But I must first tell you about the animal in its native\r\nforests.\r\n\r\n"In the luxuriant forests with which a large portion of Asia is covered,\r\nthis huge animal reigns supreme. Its size and strength easily enable it\r\nto overcome the most formidable opponents. The intelligence with which\r\nit has been endowed by its Creator would make it a most formidable enemy\r\nto man, but that the same All-wise Being has graciously endowed it with\r\npeaceful and gentle feelings. In its native forests it roams about\r\nwithout seeking to molest any one, and even when caught and tamed it\r\nvery soon becomes gentle and obedient.\r\n\r\n"In the East Indies the elephant is in very general use as a beast of\r\nburden. For this purpose it is hunted and caught in great numbers by the\r\nNatives, who employ some very ingenious devices to deceive them, and to\r\ndrive them into the ambuscades which they form for them. The manner in\r\nwhich whole herds are captured is as follows:--\r\n\r\n"When the herd is discovered by parties who are sent out for the purpose\r\nof reconnoitering, they take notice of the direction in which it is\r\nranging, and as, if their food is plentiful, they generally continue to\r\nadvance in one direction for miles together, the hunters construct, at a\r\nconsiderable distance in front, a series of enclosures, into which it\r\nis their object to drive them.\r\n\r\n"When every thing is prepared, the hunters, sometimes to the number of\r\nseveral hundreds, divide themselves into small parties, and form a large\r\ncircle, so as to surround the herd. Each party generally consists of\r\nthree men, whose duty it is to light a fire and to clear a footpath\r\nbetween their station and that of their neighbours, so that in this way\r\na communication is kept up by the whole circle, and assistance can at\r\nonce be afforded at any given point.\r\n\r\n"New circles are constantly formed at short distances in advance, so as\r\ngradually to drive the animals in the required direction. The hunters\r\nare all the while concealed by the luxuriant jungle, and do not show\r\nthemselves to the elephants at all, but urge them forward by the use of\r\ndrums, rattles, &c. &c., from the noise of which the animals seek to\r\nescape, and thus wander on, feeding as they proceed toward the toils\r\nwhich are prepared for them.\r\n\r\n"The _keddah_, or trap, as it may be called, consists of three\r\nenclosures, each formed of strong stockades on the outside of deep\r\nditches; the innermost one being the strongest, because by the time they\r\narrive in it, the elephants are generally in a state of great\r\nexcitement, and would soon break down a fragile enclosure, and make\r\ntheir escape.\r\n\r\n"As soon as the herd has entered the first enclosure, strong barricades\r\nare erected across the entrance; and as there is no ditch at this point,\r\nthe hunters take advantage of the remarkable dread which the animal has\r\nof fire, to scare them from this most vulnerable part of the\r\nfortification. Fires are gradually lit all round the first enclosure, so\r\nthat the only way of escape which is left is by the entrance to the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n"At first, as if profiting by their former experience, they generally\r\nshun the entrance to the second of the series, but at last, seeing no\r\nother chance of escape, the leader of the herd ventures forward, and the\r\nrest follow. The gate is instantly shut, and they are in the same\r\nmanner driven into the third enclosure. Finding no outlet from this they\r\nbecome desperate, scream with tremendous power, and seek to escape by\r\nviolently attacking the sides of the stockade. At all points, however,\r\nthey are repulsed by lighted fires, and the tumultuous and exulting\r\nshouts of the triumphant hunters.\r\n\r\n"In this place of confinement they remain for several days. When their\r\nexcitement has somewhat subsided, they are enticed one by one to enter a\r\nnarrow passage leading to the second enclosure. As soon as one enters\r\nin, the entrance is closed, and as the passage is so narrow that it\r\ncannot turn round, it soon fatigues itself by unavailing exertions to\r\nbeat down the barrier. Strong ropes with running nooses are now laid\r\ndown, and no sooner does the animal put his foot within one of them,\r\nthan the rope is drawn tight by some of the hunters who are stationed on\r\na small scaffold which has been raised over the gateway. In the same\r\nmanner his other feet are secured. When this has been effected, some of\r\nthe hunters venture to approach, and tie his hind legs together. Having\r\nthus secured him, they can with comparative safety complete their\r\ncapture. When he is completely secured he is placed between two tame\r\nelephants, and led away to the forest and fastened to a tree; and the\r\nsame operation is repeated, till the whole herd has been secured. At\r\nfirst the rage of the captive is extreme; so long as the animals between\r\nwhich he is led away prisoner remain with him he is comparatively quiet,\r\nbut when he sees them depart, he is agitated with all the horrors of\r\ndespair, and makes the most extravagant attempts to regain his liberty.\r\nFor some time he refuses to eat, but gradually becomes resigned, and\r\nfeeds freely.\r\n\r\n"A keeper is appointed to each animal, as they are secured. His first\r\nobject is to gain its confidence; supplying it regularly with food,\r\npouring water over its body to keep it cool, and gradually accustoming\r\nit to caresses. In the course of five or six weeks he generally obtains\r\na complete ascendency over it; its fetters are removed by degrees, it\r\nknows his voice and obeys him, and is then gradually initiated into the\r\nobjects of its future labours."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Uncle Thomas. I now understand all about elephant-hunting. I\r\ncould not think how the hunters managed to secure such a huge animal. It\r\nseems to be no such difficult task after all."\r\n\r\n"It seems easy enough from description, Frank; but it sometimes happens\r\nthat they break loose, and, irritated by their efforts to escape, they\r\nrange about in the most furious manner, and as they are very cunning\r\nanimals, it requires all the circumspection of the hunter to counteract\r\ntheir schemes. I recollect a story which displays this quality in a very\r\nstrong light.\r\n\r\n"During the seige of Bhurtpore, in the year 1805, when the British army,\r\nwith its countless host of followers and attendants, and thousands of\r\ncattle, had been for a long time before the city, the approach of the\r\nwarm season and of the dry hot winds caused the quantity of water in the\r\nneighbourhood of the camps to begin to fail; the ponds or tanks had\r\ndried up, and no more water was left than the immense wells of the\r\ncountry could furnish. The multitude of men and cattle that were\r\nunceasingly at the wells, occasioned no little struggle for priority in\r\nprocuring the supply, and the consequent confusion on the spot was\r\nfrequently very considerable. On one occasion, two elephant-drivers,\r\neach with his elephant, the one remarkably large and strong, and the\r\nother comparatively small and weak, were at the well together; the small\r\nelephant had been provided by his master with a bucket for the occasion,\r\nwhich he carried at the end of his proboscis; but the larger animal\r\nbeing destitute of this necessary vessel, either spontaneously, or by\r\ndesire of his keeper, seized the bucket, and easily wrested it away from\r\nhis less powerful fellow-servant. The latter was too sensible of his\r\ninferiority openly to resist the insult, though it is obvious that he\r\nfelt it; and great squabbling and abuse ensued between the keepers.\r\n\r\n"At length, the weaker animal, watching the opportunity when the other\r\nwas standing with his side to the well, retired backwards a few paces,\r\nin a very quiet unsuspicious manner, and then rushing forward with all\r\nhis might, drove his head against the side of the other, and fairly\r\npushed him into the well. It may easily be imagined that great\r\ninconvenience was immediately experienced, and serious apprehensions\r\nquickly followed, that the water in the well, on which the existence of\r\nso many seemed in a great measure to depend, would be spoiled by the\r\nunwieldy brute which was precipitated into it; and as the surface of the\r\nwater was nearly twenty feet below the common level, there did not\r\nappear to be any means that could be adopted to get the animal out by\r\nmain force, without the risk of injuring him. There were many feet of\r\nwater below the elephant, who floated with ease on its surface, and,\r\nexperiencing considerable pleasure from his cool retreat, he evinced but\r\nlittle inclination even to exert what means of escape he might himself\r\npossess.\r\n\r\n"A vast number of fascines (bundles of wood) had been employed by the\r\narmy in conducting the siege; and at length it occurred to the\r\nelephant-keeper, that a sufficient number of these might be lowered into\r\nthe well, on which the animal might be raised to the top, if it could be\r\ninstructed as to the necessary means of laying them in regular\r\nsuccession under its feet. Permission having accordingly been obtained\r\nfrom the engineers to use the fascines, the keeper had to teach the\r\nelephant the lesson, which, by means of that extraordinary ascendency\r\nthese men attain over their charge, joined with the intellectual\r\nresources of the animal itself, he was soon enabled to do; and the\r\nelephant began quickly to place each fascine, as it was lowered,\r\nsuccessively under him, until, in a little time, he was enabled to stand\r\nupon them. By this time, however, the cunning brute, enjoying the\r\npleasure of his situation, after the heat and partial privation of water\r\nto which he had been lately exposed, was unwilling to work any longer;\r\nand all the threats of his keeper could not induce him to place another\r\nfascine. The man then opposed cunning to cunning, and began to caress\r\nand praise the elephant; and what he could not effect by threats he was\r\nenabled to do by the repeated promise of plenty of arrack, a spirituous\r\nbeverage composed of rum, of which the elephant is very fond. Incited by\r\nthis, the animal again set to work, raised himself considerably higher,\r\nuntil, by a partial removal of the masonry round the top of the well, he\r\nwas enabled to step out, after having been in the water about fourteen\r\nhours."\r\n\r\n"That was very cunning, Uncle Thomas. The keepers seem to attain great\r\nascendency over the animals."\r\n\r\n"The attachment of the elephant to its keeper, and the command which\r\nsome of these men acquire over the objects of their care by appealing\r\nto their affections is very extraordinary. The mere sound of the\r\nkeeper\'s voice has been known to reclaim an animal which escaped from\r\ndomestication and resumed its original freedom:--\r\n\r\n"A female elephant, belonging to a gentleman in Calcutta, who was\r\nordered from the upper country to Chittagong, in the route thither,\r\nbroke loose from her keeper, and, making her way to the woods, was lost.\r\nThe keeper made every excuse to vindicate himself, which the master of\r\nthe animal would not listen to, but branded the man with dishonesty; for\r\nit was instantly supposed that he had sold the elephant. He was tried\r\nfor it, and condemned to work on the roads for life, and his wife and\r\nchildren sold for slaves.\r\n\r\n"About twelve years afterwards, this man, who was known to be well\r\nacquainted with breaking elephants, was sent into the country with a\r\nparty to assist in catching wild ones. They came upon a herd, amongst\r\nwhich the man fancied he saw the long-lost elephant for which he had\r\nbeen condemned. He resolved to approach it, nor could the strongest\r\nremonstrances of the party dissuade him from the attempt. As he\r\napproached the animal, he called her by name, when she immediately\r\nrecognised his voice; she waved her trunk in the air as a token of\r\nsalutation, and kneeling down, allowed him to mount her neck. She\r\nafterwards assisted in taking other elephants, and decoyed three young\r\nones, to which she had given birth since her escape. The keeper returned\r\nto his master, and the singular circumstances attending the recovery of\r\nthe elephant being told, he regained his character; and, as a recompense\r\nfor his unmerited sufferings, had a pension settled on him for life."\r\n\r\n"That was an instance of rare good fortune, Uncle Thomas. How very\r\ncurious that he should fall in with the herd in which his own elephant\r\nwas!"\r\n\r\n"It was very fortunate indeed, Frank. It was not a little curious too\r\nthat the elephant should recognise him after so long a period. But the\r\nattachment which they show to their keepers is sometimes very great. One\r\nwhich in a moment of rage killed its keeper a few years ago, adopted his\r\nson as its _carnac_ or driver, and would allow no one else to assume his\r\nplace. The wife of the unfortunate man was witness to the dreadful\r\nscene, and, in the frenzy of her mental agony, took her two children,\r\nand threw them at the feet of the elephant, saying, \'As you have slain\r\nmy husband, take my life also, as well as that of my children!\' The\r\nelephant became calm, seemed to relent, and as if stung with remorse,\r\ntook up the eldest boy with its trunk, placed him on its neck, adopted\r\nhim for its carnac, and never afterwards allowed another to occupy that\r\nseat."\r\n\r\n"That was at least making all the reparation in its power, Uncle\r\nThomas."\r\n\r\n"There is one or two other stories about the elephant, showing that he\r\nknows how to revenge an insult, which I must tell you before you go.\r\n\r\n"A merchant at Bencoolen kept a tame elephant, which was so exceedingly\r\ngentle in his habits, that he was permitted to go at large. This huge\r\nanimal used to walk about the streets in the most quiet and orderly\r\nmanner, and paid many visits through the city to people who were kind to\r\nhim. Two cobblers took an ill will to this inoffensive creature, and\r\nseveral times pricked him on the proboscis with their awls. The noble\r\nanimal did not chastise them in the manner he might have done, and\r\nseemed to think they were too contemptible to be angry with them. But he\r\ntook other means to punish them for their cruelty. He filled his trunk\r\nwith water of a dirty quality, and advancing towards them in his\r\nordinary manner, spouted the whole of the puddle over them. The\r\npunishment was highly applauded by those who witnessed it, and the poor\r\ncobblers were laughed at for their pains."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ELEPHANT AND THE COBBLERS--Page 68.]\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! ha! He must have been a very knowing animal, Uncle Thomas. I\r\ndare say, the cobblers behaved better in future."\r\n\r\n"I dare say they would, Boys. Here is another story of the same\r\ndescription, but the trickster did not escape so easily."\r\n\r\n"A person in the island of Ceylon, who lived near a place where\r\nelephants were daily led to water, and often sat at the door of his\r\nhouse, used occasionally to give one of these animals some fig leaves, a\r\nfood to which elephants are very partial. Once he took it into his head\r\nto play one of the elephants a trick. He wrapped a stone round with fig\r\nleaves, and said to the carnac, \'This time I will give him a stone to\r\neat, and see how it will agree with him.\' The carnac answered, \'that the\r\nelephant would not be such a fool as to swallow a stone.\' The man,\r\nhowever, reached the stone to the elephant, who, taking it with his\r\ntrunk, immediately let it fall to the ground. \'You see,\' said the\r\nkeeper, \'that I was right;\' and without further words, drove away his\r\nelephants. After they were watered, he was conducting them again to\r\ntheir stable. The man who had played the elephant the trick was still\r\nsitting at his door, when, before he was aware, the animal ran at him,\r\nthrew his trunk around his body, and, dashing him to the ground,\r\ntrampled him immediately to death."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     Uncle Thomas introduces to the Notice of the Young Folks the\r\n     Ettrick Shepherd\'s Stories about Sheep; and tells them some\r\n     Interesting Stories about the Goat, and its Peculiarities.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I dare say, Boys, you have not forgotten the Ettrick Shepherd\'s\r\nwonderful stories about his dogs. Some of those which he relates about\r\nsheep are equally remarkable, and as he tells them in the same pleasing\r\nstyle, I think I cannot do better than read to you the chapter in \'The\r\nShepherd\'s Calendar\' which he devotes to this animal."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Uncle Thomas. We remember very well his stories about Sirrah\r\nand Hector and Chieftain, and the old Shepherd\'s grief at parting with\r\nhis dog."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Boys; I am pleased to think that you do not forget what I\r\ntell you. But listen to the Ettrick Shepherd."\r\n\r\n"The sheep has scarcely any marked character save that of natural\r\naffection, of which it possesses a very great share. It is otherwise a\r\nstupid indifferent animal, having few wants, and fewer expedients. The\r\nold black-faced, or forest breed, have far more powerful capabilities\r\nthan any of the finer breeds that have been introduced into Scotland,\r\nand, therefore, the few anecdotes that I have to relate shall be\r\nconfined to them.\r\n\r\n"So strong is the attachment of the sheep to the place where they have\r\nbeen bred, that I have heard of their returning from Yorkshire to the\r\nHighlands. I was always somewhat inclined to suspect that they might\r\nhave been lost by the way, but it is certain, however, that when once\r\none or a few sheep get away from the rest of their acquaintances, they\r\nreturn homeward with great eagerness and perseverance. I have lived\r\nbeside a drove-road the better part of my life, and many stragglers have\r\nI seen bending their steps northward in the spring of the year. A\r\nshepherd rarely sees these journeyers twice; if he sees them, and stops\r\nthem in the morning, they are gone long before night; and if he sees\r\nthem at night they will be gone many miles before morning. This strong\r\nattachment to the place of their nativity is much more predominant in\r\nour old aboriginal breed than in any of the other kinds with which I am\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\n"The most singular instance that I know of, to be quite well\r\nauthenticated, is that of a black ewe, that returned with her lamb from\r\na farm in the head of Glen-Lyon, to the farm of Harehope, in Tweeddale,\r\nand accomplished the journey in nine days. She was soon missed by her\r\nowner, and a shepherd was despatched in pursuit of her, who followed her\r\nall the way to Crieff, where he turned, and gave her up. He got\r\nintelligence of her all the way, and every one told him that she\r\nabsolutely persisted in travelling on,--she would not be turned,\r\nregarding neither sheep nor shepherd by the way. Her lamb was often far\r\nbehind, and she had constantly to urge it on by impatient bleating. She\r\nunluckily came to Stirling on the morning of a great annual fair, about\r\nthe end of May, and judging it imprudent to venture through the crowd\r\nwith her lamb, she halted on the north side of the town the whole day,\r\nwhere she was seen by hundreds, lying close by the road-side. But next\r\nmorning, when all became quiet, a little after the break of day, she was\r\nobserved stealing quietly through the town, in apparent terror of the\r\ndogs that were prowling about the street. The last time she was seen on\r\nthe road was at a toll-bar near St. Ninian\'s; the man stopped her,\r\nthinking she was a strayed animal, and that some one would claim her.\r\nShe tried several times to break through by force when he opened the\r\ngate, but he always prevented her, and at length she turned patiently\r\nback. She had found some means of eluding him, however, for home she\r\ncame on a Sabbath morning, early in June; and she left the farm of\r\nLochs, in Glen-Lyon, either on the Thursday afternoon, or Friday\r\nmorning, a week and two days before. The farmer of Harehope paid the\r\nHighland farmer the price of her, and she remained on her native farm\r\ntill she died of old age, in her seventeenth year.\r\n\r\n"With regard to the natural affection of this animal, the instances that\r\nmight be mentioned are without number. When one loses its sight in a\r\nflock of sheep, it is rarely abandoned to itself in that hapless and\r\nhelpless state. Some one always attaches itself to it, and by bleating\r\ncalls it back from the precipice, the lake, the pool, and all dangers\r\nwhatever. There is a disease among sheep, called by shepherds the\r\nBreakshugh, a deadly sort of dysentery, which is as infectious as fire,\r\nin a flock. Whenever a sheep feels itself seized by this, it instantly\r\nwithdraws from all the rest, shunning their society with the greatest\r\ncare; it even hides itself, and is often very hard to be found. Though\r\nthis propensity can hardly be attributed to natural instinct, it is, at\r\nall events, a provision of nature of the greatest kindness and\r\nbeneficence.\r\n\r\n"Another manifest provision of nature with regard to these animals is,\r\nthat the more inhospitable the land is on which they feed, the greater\r\ntheir kindness and attention to their young. I once herded two years on\r\na wild and bare farm called Willenslee, on the border of Mid-Lothian,\r\nand of all the sheep I ever saw, these were the kindest and most\r\naffectionate to their lambs. I was often deeply affected at scenes which\r\nI witnessed. We had one very hard winter, so that our sheep grew lean in\r\nthe spring, and the thwarter-ill (a sort of paralytic affection) came\r\namong them, and carried off a number. Often have I seen these poor\r\nvictims, when fallen down to rise no more, even when unable to lift\r\ntheir heads from the ground, holding up the leg, to invite the starving\r\nlamb to the miserable pittance that the udder still could supply. I had\r\nnever seen aught more painfully affecting.\r\n\r\n"It is well known that it is a custom with shepherds, when a lamb dies,\r\nif the mother have a sufficiency of milk, to bring her from the hill,\r\nand put another lamb to her. This is done by putting the skin of the\r\ndead lamb upon the living one; the ewe immediately acknowledges the\r\nrelationship, and after the skin has warmed on it, so as to give it\r\nsomething of the smell of her own progeny, and it has sucked her two or\r\nthree times, she accepts and nourishes it as her own ever after. Whether\r\nit is from joy at this apparent reanimation of her young one, or because\r\na little doubt remains on her mind which she would fain dispel, I cannot\r\ndecide; but, for a number of days, she shows far more fondness, by\r\nbleating and caressing over this one, than she did formerly over the one\r\nthat was really her own. But this is not what I wanted to explain; it\r\nwas, that such sheep as thus lose their lambs must be driven to a house\r\nwith dogs, so that the lamb may be put to them; for they will only take\r\nit in a dark confined place. But at Willenslee, I never needed to drive\r\nhome a sheep by force, with dogs, or in any other way than the\r\nfollowing: I found every ewe, of course, standing hanging her head over\r\nher dead lamb; and having a piece of twine with me for the purpose, I\r\ntied that to the lamb\'s neck or foot, and trailing it along, the ewe\r\nfollowed me into any house or fold that I choose to lead her. Any of\r\nthem would have followed me in that way for miles, with her nose close\r\non the lamb, which she never quitted for a moment, except to chase my\r\ndog, which she would not suffer to walk near me. I often, out of\r\ncuriosity, led them in to the side of the kitchen fire by this means,\r\ninto the midst of servants and dogs; but the more that dangers\r\nmultiplied around the ewe, she clung the closer to her dead offspring,\r\nand thought of nothing whatever but protecting it. One of the two years,\r\nwhile I remained on this farm, a severe blast of snow came on by night,\r\nabout the latter end of April, which destroyed several scores of our\r\nlambs; and as we had not enow of twins and odd lambs for the mothers\r\nthat had lost theirs, of course we selected the best ewes, and put lambs\r\nto them. As we were making the distribution, I requested of my master\r\nto spare me a lamb for a hawked ewe which he knew, and which was\r\nstanding over a dead lamb in the head of the Hope, about four miles from\r\nthe house. He would not do it, but bid me let her stand over her lamb\r\nfor a day or two, and perhaps a twin would be forthcoming. I did so, and\r\nfaithfully she did stand to her charge; so faithfully, that I think the\r\nlike never was equalled by any of the woolly race. I visited her every\r\nmorning and evening, and for the first eight days never found her above\r\ntwo or three yards from the lamb; and always, as I went my rounds, she\r\neyed me long ere I came near her, and kept tramping with her feet, and\r\nwhistling through her nose, to frighten away the dog; he got a regular\r\nchase twice a day as I passed by: but, however excited and fierce a ewe\r\nmay be, she never offers any resistance to mankind, being perfectly and\r\nmeekly passive to them. The weather grew fine and warm, and the dead\r\nlamb soon decayed, which the body of a dead lamb does particularly\r\nsoon: but still this affectionate and desolate creature kept hanging\r\nover the poor remains with an attachment that seemed to be nourished by\r\nhopelessness. It often drew the tears from my eyes to see her hanging\r\nwith such fondness over a few bones, mixed with a small portion of wool.\r\nFor the first fortnight she never quitted the spot, and for another week\r\nshe visited it every morning and evening, uttering a few kindly and\r\nheart-piercing bleats each time; till at length every remnant of her\r\noffspring vanished, mixing with the soil, or wafted away by the winds."\r\n\r\n"Poor creature! Uncle Thomas, that was very affecting."\r\n\r\n"So much for the Ettrick Shepherd. I will now tell you a story about a\r\nremarkable instance of sagacity in a sheep, of which I myself was an\r\neye-witness.\r\n\r\n"One evening, as I was enjoying a walk through some verdant pastures,\r\nwhich were plentifully dotted with sheep, my attention was attracted by\r\nthe motions of one which repeatedly came close up to me, bleating in a\r\npiteous manner, and after looking expressively in my face, ran off\r\ntowards a brook which meandered through the midst of the pastures. At\r\nfirst I took little notice of the creature, but as her entreaties became\r\nimportunate, I followed her. Delighted at having at length attracted my\r\nnotice, she ran with all her speed, frequently looking back. When I\r\nreached the spot, I discovered the cause of all her anxiety; her lamb\r\nhad unfortunately fallen into the brook, whose steep banks prevented it\r\nfrom making its escape. Fortunately the water, though up to the little\r\ncreature\'s back, was not sufficient to drown it. I rescued it with much\r\npleasure, and to the great gratification of its affectionate mother, who\r\nlicked it with her tongue to dry it, now and then skipping about, and\r\ngiving vent to her joy and gratitude in most expressive gambols.\r\n\r\n"Though differing in many respects from the sheep, the goat bears so\r\nstrong a resemblance to that animal, that, now that I am speaking of it,\r\nI may as well tell you a story or two about the goat. It will save my\r\nreturning to it afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Very well, Uncle Thomas."\r\n\r\n"The goat is in every respect more fitted for a life of savage liberty\r\nthan the sheep. It is of a more lively disposition, and is possessed of\r\na greater degree of instinct. It readily attaches itself to man, and\r\nseems sensible of his caresses. It delights in climbing precipices, and\r\ngoing to the very edge of danger, and it is often seen suspended upon an\r\neminence overhanging the sea, upon a very little base, and sometimes\r\neven sleeps there in security. Nature has in some measure fitted it for\r\ntraversing these declivities with ease; the hoof is hollow underneath,\r\nwith sharp edges, so that it walks as securely on the ridge of a house\r\nas on the level ground.\r\n\r\n"When once reduced to a state of domestication, the goat seldom resumes\r\nits original wildness. A good many years ago, an English vessel\r\nhappening to touch at the island of Bonavista, two negroes came and\r\noffered the sailors as many goats as they chose to take away. Upon the\r\ncaptain expressing his surprise at this offer, the negroes assured him\r\nthat there were but twelve persons on the island, and that the goats had\r\nmultiplied in such a manner as even to become a nuisance: they added,\r\nthat far from giving any trouble to capture them, they followed the few\r\ninhabitants that were left with a sort of obstinacy, and became even\r\ntroublesome by their tameness. The celebrated traveller Dr. Clarke gives\r\na very curious account of a goat, which was trained to exhibit various\r\namusing feats of dexterity.\r\n\r\n"We met, (says he,) an Arab with a goat which he led about the country\r\nto exhibit, in order to gain a livelihood for itself and its owner. He\r\nhad taught this animal, while he accompanied its movements with a song,\r\nto mount upon little cylindrical blocks of wood, placed successively one\r\nabove another, and in shape resembling the dice-box belonging to a\r\nbackgammon table. In this manner the goat stood, first, on the top of\r\ntwo; afterwards, of three, four, five, and six, until it remained\r\nbalanced upon the summit of them all, elevated several feet above the\r\nground, and with its four feet collected upon a single point, without\r\nthrowing down the disjointed fabric on which it stood. The diameter of\r\nthe upper cylinder, on which its four feet alternately remained until\r\nthe Arab had ended his ditty, was only two inches, and the length of\r\neach six inches. The most curious part of the performance occurred\r\nafterwards; for the Arab, to convince us of the animal\'s attention to\r\nthe turn of the air, interrupted the _Da Capo_; and, as often as he did\r\nthis, the goat tottered, appeared uneasy, and, upon his becoming\r\nsuddenly silent, in the middle of his song, it fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARAB AND HIS GOAT--Page 84.]\r\n\r\n"Like the sheep, the goat possesses great natural affection for its\r\nyoung. In its defence it boldly repels the attacks of the most\r\nformidable opponents. I remember a little story which finely illustrates\r\nthis instinctive courage.\r\n\r\n"A person having missed one of his goats when his flock was taken home\r\nat night, being afraid the wanderer would get among the young trees in\r\nhis nursery, two boys, wrapped in their plaids, were ordered to watch\r\nall night. The morning had but faintly dawned, when they set out in\r\nsearch of her. They at length discovered her on a pointed rock at a\r\nconsiderable distance, and hastening to the spot perceived her standing\r\nwatching her kid with the greatest anxiety, and defending it from a fox.\r\nThe enemy turned round and round to lay hold of his prey, but the goat\r\npresented her horns in every direction. The youngest boy was despatched\r\nfor assistance to attack the fox, and the eldest, hallooing and throwing\r\nup stones, sought to intimidate it as he climbed to rescue his charge.\r\nThe fox seemed well aware that the child could not execute his threats;\r\nhe looked at him one instant, and then renewed the assault, till, quite\r\nimpatient, he made a sudden effort to seize the kid. The whole three\r\nsuddenly disappeared, and were found at the bottom of the precipice.\r\nThe goat\'s horns were darted into the back of the fox; the kid lay\r\nstretched beside her. It is supposed that the fox had fixed his teeth in\r\nthe kid, for its neck was lacerated; but that when the faithful mother\r\ninflicted a death wound upon her mortal enemy he probably staggered, and\r\nbrought his victims with him over the rock.\r\n\r\n"There is another story of the goat, which places its gratitude and\r\naffection in such an interesting light, that I am sure it will delight\r\nyou:--\r\n\r\n"After the final suppression of the Scottish Rebellion of 1715, by the\r\ndecisive Battle of Preston, a gentleman who had taken a very active\r\nshare in it escaped to the West Highlands to the residence of a female\r\nrelative, who afforded him an asylum. As in consequence of the strict\r\nsearch which was made after the ringleaders, it was soon judged unsafe\r\nfor him to remain in the house of his friend, he was conducted to a\r\ncavern in a sequestered situation, and furnished with a supply of food.\r\nThe approach to this lonely abode consisted of a small aperture,\r\nthrough which he crept, dragging his provisions along with him. A little\r\nway from the mouth of the cave the roof became elevated, but on\r\nadvancing, an obstacle obstructed his progress. He soon perceived that,\r\nwhatever it might be, the object was a living one, but unwilling to\r\nstrike at a venture with his dirk, he stooped down, and discovered a\r\ngoat and her kid lying on the ground. The animal was evidently in great\r\npain, and feeling her body and limbs, he ascertained that one of her\r\nlegs had been fractured. He bound it up with his garter, and offered her\r\nsome of his bread; but she refused to eat, and stretched out her tongue,\r\nas if intimating that her mouth was parched with thirst. He gave her\r\nwater, which she drank greedily, and then she ate the bread. At midnight\r\nhe ventured from the cave, pulled a quantity of grass and the tender\r\nbranches of trees, and carried them to the poor sufferer, which received\r\nthem with demonstrations of gratitude.\r\n\r\n"The only thing which this fugitive had to arrest his attention in his\r\ndreary abode, was administering comfort to the goat; and he was indeed\r\nthankful to have any living creature beside him. It quickly recovered,\r\nand became tenderly attached to him. It happened that the servant who\r\nwas intrusted with the secret of his retreat fell sick, when it became\r\nnecessary to send another with provisions. The goat, on this occasion,\r\nhappening to be lying near the mouth of the cavern, opposed his entrance\r\nwith all her might, butting him furiously; the fugitive, hearing a\r\ndisturbance, went forward, and receiving the watchword from his new\r\nattendant, interposed, and the faithful goat permitted him to pass. So\r\nresolute was the animal on this occasion, that the gentleman was\r\nconvinced she would have died in his defence."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     Uncle Thomas relates some Very Remarkable Stories about the Cat;\r\n     points out to the Boys the Connexion subsisting between the\r\n     Domestic Cat and the Lion, Tiger, &c., and tells them some Stories\r\n     about the Gentleness, as well as the Ferocity of these Animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Though far from being so general a favourite as the dog, the domestic\r\ncat has many qualities to recommend it to attention and regard, and some\r\nof the stories which I am going to tell you exhibit instances of\r\ninstinctive attachment and gentleness which cannot be surpassed.\r\n\r\n"Here is one of attachment, which will match with the best of those of\r\nthe dog.\r\n\r\n"A cat which had been brought up in a family became extremely attached\r\nto the eldest child, a little boy, who was very fond of playing with\r\nher. She bore with the most exemplary patience any maltreatment which\r\nshe received from him--which even good-natured children seldom fail,\r\noccasionally, to give to animals in their sports with them--without ever\r\nmaking any attempt at resistance. As the cat grew up, however, she daily\r\nquitted her playfellow for a time, from whom she had formerly been\r\ninseparable, in order to follow her natural propensity to catch mice;\r\nbut even when engaged in this employment, she did not forget her friend;\r\nfor, as soon as she had caught a mouse, she brought it alive to him. If\r\nhe showed an inclination to take her prey from her, she anticipated him,\r\nby letting it run, and waited to see whether he was able to catch it. If\r\nhe did not, the cat darted at, seized it, and laid it again before him;\r\nand in this manner the sport continued as long as the child showed any\r\ninclination for the amusement.\r\n\r\n"At length the boy was attacked by smallpox, and, during the early\r\nstages of his disorder, the cat never quitted his bed-side; but, as his\r\ndanger increased, it was found necessary to remove the cat and lock it\r\nup. The child died. On the following day, the cat having escaped from\r\nher confinement, immediately ran to the apartment where she hoped to\r\nfind her playmate. Disappointed in her expectation, she sought for him\r\nwith symptoms of great uneasiness and loud lamentation, all over the\r\nhouse, till she came to the door of the room in which the corpse lay.\r\nHere she lay down in silent melancholy, till she was again locked up. As\r\nsoon as the child was interred, and the cat set at liberty, she\r\ndisappeared; and it was not till a fortnight after that event, that she\r\nreturned to the well-known apartment, quite emaciated. She would not,\r\nhowever, take any nourishment, and soon ran away again with dismal\r\ncries. At length, compelled by hunger, she made her appearance every day\r\nat dinner-time, but always left the house as soon as she had eaten the\r\nfood that was given her. No one knew where she spent the rest of her\r\ntime, till she was found one day under the wall of the burying-ground,\r\nclose to the grave of her favourite; and so indelible was the attachment\r\nof the cat to her deceased friend, that till his parents removed to\r\nanother place, five years afterwards, she never, except in the greatest\r\nseverity of winter, passed the night any where else than at the\r\nabove-mentioned spot, close to the grave. Ever afterwards she was\r\ntreated with the utmost kindness by every person in the family. She\r\nsuffered herself to be played with by the younger children, although\r\nwithout exhibiting a particular partiality for any of them.\r\n\r\n"There is another story of the cat\'s attachment, of a somewhat less\r\nmelancholy cast, which I lately saw recorded in a provincial newspaper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AFFECTIONATE CAT--Page 92.]\r\n\r\n"A country gentleman of our acquaintance, who is neither a friend to\r\nthieves nor poachers, has at this moment in his household a favourite\r\ncat, whose honesty, he is sorry to say, there is but too much reason\r\nto call in question. The animal, however, is far from being selfish in\r\nher principles; for her acceptable gleanings she regularly shares among\r\nthe children of the family in which her lot is cast. It is the habit of\r\ngrimalkin to leave the kitchen or parlour, as often as hunger and an\r\nopportunity may occur, and wend her way to a certain pastrycook\'s shop,\r\nwhere, the better to conceal her purpose, she endeavours slily to\r\ningratiate herself into favour with the mistress of the house. As soon\r\nas the shopkeeper\'s attention becomes engrossed in business, or\r\notherwise, puss contrives to pilfer a small pie or tart from the shelves\r\non which they are placed, speedily afterwards making the best of her way\r\nhome with her booty. She then carefully delivers her prize to some of\r\nthe little ones in the nursery. A division of the stolen property\r\nquickly takes place; and here it is singularly amusing to observe the\r\ncunning animal, not the least conspicuous among the numerous group,\r\nthankfully mumping her share of the illegal traffic. We may add that\r\nthe pastrycook is by no means disposed to institute a legal process\r\nagainst the delinquent, as the children of the gentleman to whom we\r\nallude are honest enough to acknowledge their four-footed playmate\'s\r\nfailings to papa, who willingly compensates any damage the pastrycook\r\nmay sustain from the petty depredations of the would-be philanthropic\r\ncat.\r\n\r\n"I remember how highly pleased you were with the story which I told you\r\nabout the dog discovering the murderers of his master. There is one of a\r\nvery similar description of a French cat, which I am sure will equally\r\ninterest you.\r\n\r\n"In the beginning of the present century a woman was murdered in Paris.\r\nThe magistrate who went to investigate the affair was accompanied by a\r\nphysician; they found the body lying upon the floor, and a greyhound\r\nwatching over it, and howling mournfully. When the gentleman entered the\r\napartment, it ran to them without barking, and then returned with a\r\nmelancholy mien to the body of his murdered mistress. Upon a chest in a\r\ncorner of the room sat a cat, motionless, with eyes expressive of\r\nfurious indignation, stedfastly fixed upon the body. Many persons now\r\nentered the apartment, but neither the appearance of such a crowd of\r\nstrangers, nor the confusion that prevailed in the place, could make her\r\nchange her position. In the mean time, some persons were apprehended on\r\nsuspicion of being the murderers, and it was resolved to lead them into\r\nthe apartment. Before the cat got sight of them, when she only heard\r\ntheir footsteps approaching, her eyes flashed with increased fury, her\r\nhair stood erect, and so soon as she saw them enter the apartment, she\r\nsprang towards them with expressions of the most violent rage, but did\r\nnot venture to attack them, being probably alarmed by the numbers that\r\nfollowed. Having turned several times towards them with a peculiar\r\nferocity of aspect, she crept into a corner, with an air indicative of\r\nthe deepest melancholy. This behaviour of the cat astonished every one\r\npresent. The effect which it produced upon the murderers was such as\r\nalmost to amount to an acknowledgment of guilt. Nor did this remain long\r\ndoubtful, for a train of accessory circumstances was soon discovered\r\nwhich proved it to complete conviction.\r\n\r\n"I have often warned you against stories of ghosts and hobgoblins, and\r\nshown you on how frail a foundation they generally rest. There is a\r\nstory in which a cat was one of the principal actors, which contains the\r\nelements of as marvellous a tale of this description as could be\r\ndesired. It happened in the west of Scotland.\r\n\r\n"Some years ago, a poor man whose habits of life had always been of the\r\nmost retired description, giving way to the natural despondency of his\r\ndisposition, put an end to his existence. The only other inmate of his\r\ncottage was a favourite cat, When the deed was discovered, the cat was\r\nfound assiduously watching over her late master\'s body, and it was with\r\nsome difficulty she could be driven away.\r\n\r\n"The appalling deed naturally excited a great deal of attention in the\r\nsurrounding neighbourhood; and on the day after the body was deposited\r\nin the grave, which was made at the outside of the church-yard, a number\r\nof school-boys ventured thither, to view the resting-place of one who\r\nhad at times been the subject of village wonder, and whose recent act of\r\nself-destruction was invested with additional interest. At first, no one\r\nwas brave enough to venture near; but at last, the appearance of a hole\r\nin the side of the grave irresistibly attracted their attention. Having\r\nbeen minutely examined, it was at length determined that it must have\r\nbeen the work of some body-snatcher, and the story having spread, the\r\ngrave was minutely examined, but as the body had not been removed, the\r\ncommunity considered themselves fortunate in having made so narrow an\r\nescape. The turf was replaced, and the grave again carefully covered\r\nup.\r\n\r\n"On the following morning the turf was again displaced, and a hole,\r\ndeeper than before, yawned in the side of the sad receptacle.\r\nSpeculation was soon busy at work, and all sorts of explanations were\r\nsuggested. In the midst of their speculations, alarmed perhaps by the\r\nnoise of the disputants, poor puss darted from the hole, much to the\r\nconfusion of some of the most noisy and dogmatic expounders of the\r\nmystery. Again the turf was replaced, and again and again was it removed\r\nby the unceasing efforts of the faithful cat to share the resting-place\r\nof her deceased master. It was at last found necessary to shoot her, it\r\nbeing found impossible otherwise to put a stop to her unceasing\r\nimportunities."\r\n\r\n"Poor puss! What a pity it should have been necessary to destroy such a\r\nfaithful animal. I wonder no one tried to gain its affections, and thus\r\ncharm it from its dreary abode. Uncle Thomas, did you ever hear Dr.\r\nGood\'s account of a very extraordinary instance of sagacity exemplified\r\nby his cat? I was very much struck with it when I saw it a day or two\r\nago in his \'Book of Nature.\' If you please, I will read it to you."\r\n\r\n"Very well, Harry, I shall be glad to hear it; I dare say it is an old\r\nacquaintance of mine. I have been such a diligent searcher after stories\r\nof this description, that I think very few have escaped me."\r\n\r\n"A favourite cat, that was accustomed from day to day to take her\r\nstation quietly at my elbow, on the writing table, sometimes for hour\r\nafter hour, whilst I was engaged in study, became at length less\r\nconstant in her attendance, as she had a kitten to take care of. One\r\nmorning she placed herself in the same spot, but seemed unquiet, and,\r\ninstead of seating herself as usual, continued to rub her furry sides\r\nagainst my hand and pen, as though resolved to draw my attention, and\r\nmake me leave off. As soon as she had accomplished this point, she\r\nleaped down on the carpet, and made towards the door, with a look of\r\ngreat uneasiness. I opened the door for her, as she seemed to desire,\r\nbut, instead of going forward, she turned round, and looked earnestly at\r\nme, as though she wished me to follow her, or had something to\r\ncommunicate. I did not fully understand her meaning, and, being much\r\nengaged at the time, shut the door upon her, that she might go where she\r\nliked.\r\n\r\n"In less than an hour afterwards, however, she had again found an\r\nentrance into the room, and drawn close to me, but, instead of mounting\r\nthe table, and rubbing herself against my hand, as before, she was now\r\nunder the table, and continued to rub herself against my feet, on moving\r\nwhich I struck them against a something which seemed to be in their way,\r\nand, on looking down, beheld with equal grief and astonishment the dead\r\nbody of her little kitten which I supposed had been alive and in good\r\nhealth, covered over with cinder dust. I now entered into the entire\r\ntrain of this afflicted cat\'s feelings. She had suddenly lost the\r\nnursling she doated on, and was resolved to make me acquainted with\r\nit,--assuredly that I might know her grief, and probably also that I\r\nmight inquire into the cause, and, finding me too dull to understand her\r\nexpressive motioning that I would follow her to the cinder heap, on\r\nwhich the dead kitten had been thrown, she took the great labour of\r\nbringing it to me herself, from the area on the basement floor, and up a\r\nwhole flight of stairs, and laid it at my feet. I took up the kitten in\r\nmy hand, the cat still following me, made inquiry into the cause of its\r\ndeath, which I found, upon summoning the servants, to have been an\r\naccident, in which no one was much to blame; and the yearning mother\r\nhaving thus obtained her object, and gotten her master to enter into her\r\ncause, and divide her sorrows with her, gradually took comfort, and\r\nresumed her former station by my side."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Harry, I do not think I ever heard that story before. Here\r\nis one that will match it however, displaying considerable ingenuity in\r\na cat in the protection of her young.\r\n\r\n"A cat belonging to Mr. Stevens, of the Red Lion Hotel, Truro, having\r\nbeen removed from that town to a barn at some distance, soon afterwards\r\nproduced four kittens. Not wishing the stock increased, Mr. Stevens\r\ndesired three of them to be drowned, next morning, before opening their\r\neyes on the world. Puss was deeply affected by this bereavement, and\r\nresolved on moving her remaining offspring to a place of security. When\r\nthe person appointed to feed grimalkin went with her breakfast next day,\r\nno traces of her or her kitten were to be found. He called; but all was\r\nsilent as the tomb; every corner was searched in vain; no cat was\r\nforthcoming. Here the matter rested for several days, when, at length,\r\nearly one morning, puss made her appearance in the court of her master\'s\r\nhouse, a melancholy picture of starvation. Having satisfied her hunger,\r\nand loitered about the house during the day, late in the evening she\r\ntook her departure, carrying away some meat. For several days she\r\ncontinued her visits in the same manner, taking care never to leave home\r\nempty-mouthed at night. Her proceedings having excited attention, she\r\nwas followed by two men, in one of her nocturnal retreats, and traced to\r\nthe top of a wheat stack, at some distance. On obtaining a ladder, her\r\nsurviving kitten was found, in a curiously constructed hole, sleek and\r\nplump, but as wild as a young tiger, and would allow no one to touch it.\r\nA few days afterwards, the mother finding, perhaps, that her own daily\r\njourneys were rather fatiguing, or thinking it was time that the object\r\nof her solicitude should be introduced into the world, or, probably,\r\nthat the kitten had attained an age when it could protect itself, she\r\ntook advantage of a dark and silent night, when cat-worrying dogs and\r\nboys were reposing, to convey it safely to Truro, where tabby and her\r\nkitten found a welcome reception.\r\n\r\n"Though from bad education the cat and dog are generally the most\r\ndetermined enemies, some instances have occurred of the greatest\r\nfriendship subsisting between these animals. Here is an instance\r\nrecorded by a French author on the Language of Brutes.\r\n\r\n"I had a cat and dog, which became so attached to each other, that they\r\nwould never willingly be asunder. Whenever the dog got any choice morsel\r\nof food, he was sure to divide it with his whiskered friend. They always\r\nate sociably out of one plate, slept in the same bed, and daily walked\r\nout together. Wishing to put this apparently sincere friendship to the\r\nproof, I, one day, took the cat by herself into my room, while I had the\r\ndog guarded in another apartment. I entertained the cat in a most\r\nsumptuous manner, being desirous to see what sort of a meal she would\r\nmake without her friend, who had hitherto been her constant table\r\ncompanion. The cat enjoyed the treat with great glee, and seemed to have\r\nentirely forgotten the dog. I had had a partridge for dinner, half of\r\nwhich I intended to keep for supper. My wife covered it with a plate,\r\nand put it into a cupboard, the door of which she did not lock. The cat\r\nleft the room, and I walked out upon business. My wife, meanwhile, sat\r\nat work in an adjoining apartment. When I returned home, she related to\r\nme the following circumstances:--The cat, having hastily left the dining\r\nroom, went to the dog, and mewed uncommonly loud, and in different tones\r\nof voice; which the dog, from time to time, answered with a short bark.\r\nThey both then went to the door of the room where the cat had dined, and\r\nwaited till it was opened. One of my children opened the door, and\r\nimmediately the two friends entered the apartment. The mewing of the cat\r\nexcited my wife\'s attention. She rose from her seat, and stepped softly\r\nup to the door, which stood ajar, to observe what was going on. The cat\r\nled the dog to the cupboard which contained the partridge, pushed off\r\nthe plate which covered it, and, taking out my intended supper, laid it\r\nbefore her canine friend, who devoured it greedily. Probably the cat,\r\nby her mewing, had given the dog to understand what an excellent meal\r\nshe had made, and how sorry she was that he had not participated in it;\r\nbut, at the same time, had explained to him that something was left for\r\nhim in the cupboard, and persuaded him to follow her thither. Since that\r\ntime I have paid particular attention to these animals, and am perfectly\r\nconvinced that they communicate to each other whatever seems\r\ninteresting."\r\n\r\n"Oh! indeed, Uncle Thomas, do you think that animals understand each\r\nother?"\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt that they do to a limited extent, Harry, but I cannot\r\ngo the whole length of Monsieur Wenzel, who records the story I have\r\njust told you.\r\n\r\n"I will now tell you some stories about some of the other animals of the\r\ncat kind, such as the lion, tiger, &c.; and though these animals differ\r\nso much from the domestic cat, they all belong to the same family; the\r\nhuge lion, which carries off with ease a buffalo from the herd, or makes\r\nthe forest tremble with his hoarse roar is no more than an enormous cat.\r\n\r\n"I dare say you have all heard the story of \'Androcles and the Lion,\'\r\nwhich is recorded in that most delightful book, \'Sandford and Merton.\'\r\nIt is so captivating a tale, that I must repeat it to you as much for my\r\nown gratification as for yours. I will just observe, however, that it is\r\na fiction, and not a real story, though I can tell you one or two very\r\nsimilar ones, which occurred in real life."\r\n\r\n"There was a certain slave named Androcles, who was so ill treated by\r\nhis master that his life became insupportable. Finding no remedy from\r\nwhat he suffered, he at length said to himself:--\'It is better to die\r\nthan to continue to live in such hardships and misery as I am obliged to\r\nsuffer. I am determined, therefore, to run away from my master; if I am\r\ntaken again, I know that I shall be punished with a cruel death, but it\r\nis better to die at once, than to live in misery. If I escape, I must\r\nbetake myself to deserts and woods, inhabited only by wild beasts, but\r\nthey cannot use me more cruelly than I have been by my fellow-creatures,\r\ntherefore I will rather trust myself to them, than continue to be a\r\nmiserable slave.\r\n\r\n"Having formed this resolution, he took an opportunity of leaving his\r\nmaster\'s house, and hid himself in a thick forest, which was some miles\r\ndistant from the city. But here the unhappy man found that he had only\r\nescaped from one kind of misery to experience another. He wandered about\r\nall day through a vast and trackless wood, where his flesh was\r\ncontinually torn by thorns and brambles. He grew hungry, but he could\r\nfind no food in this dreary solitude. At length he was ready to die with\r\nfatigue, and lay down in despair in a large cavern.\r\n\r\n"The unfortunate man had not been long quiet in the cavern, before he\r\nheard a dreadful noise, which seemed to be the roar of some wild beast,\r\nand terrified him very much. He started up with a design to escape, and\r\nhad already reached the mouth of the cave, when he saw coming towards\r\nhim a lion of prodigious size, which prevented any possibility of\r\nretreat. He now believed his destruction to be inevitable, but to his\r\ngreat astonishment the beast advanced towards him with a gentle pace,\r\nwithout any mark of enmity or rage, and uttered a kind of mournful\r\nvoice, as if he demanded the assistance of the man.\r\n\r\n"Androcles, who was naturally of a resolute disposition, acquired\r\ncourage from this circumstance to examine his monstrous guest, who gave\r\nhim sufficient leisure for this purpose. He saw, as the lion approached\r\nhim, that he seemed to limp upon one of his legs, and that the foot was\r\nextremely swelled, as if it had been wounded. Acquiring still more\r\nfortitude from the gentle demeanour of the beast, he advanced towards\r\nhim, and took hold of the wounded part as a surgeon would examine his\r\npatient. He then perceived that a thorn of uncommon size had penetrated\r\nthe ball of the foot, and was the occasion of the swelling and the\r\nlameness which he had observed. Androcles found that the beast, far from\r\nresenting his familiarity, received it with the greatest gentleness, and\r\nseemed to invite him by his blandishments to proceed. He therefore\r\nextracted the thorn, and, pressing the swelling, discharged a\r\nconsiderable quantity of matter, which had been the cause of so much\r\npain. As soon as the beast felt himself thus relieved, he began to\r\ntestify his joy and gratitude by every expression in his power. He\r\njumped about like a wanton spaniel, wagged his enormous tail, and licked\r\nthe feet and hands of his physician. Nor was he contented with these\r\ndemonstrations of kindness. From this moment Androcles became his guest;\r\nnor did the lion ever sally forth in quest of his prey, without bringing\r\nhome the produce of his chase, and sharing it with his friend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDROCLES AND THE LION--Page 110.]\r\n\r\n"In this savage state of hospitality did the man continue to live\r\nduring several months. At length, wandering unguardedly through the\r\nwoods, he met with a company of soldiers sent out to apprehend him, and\r\nwas by them taken prisoner, and conducted back to his master. The laws\r\nof that country being very severe against slaves, he was tried and found\r\nguilty of having fled from his master, and as a punishment for his\r\npretended crime, he was sentenced to be torn in pieces by a furious\r\nlion, kept many days without food, to inspire him with additional rage.\r\n\r\n"When the destined moment arrived, the unhappy man was exposed, unarmed,\r\nin the middle of a spacious arena, inclosed on every side, round which\r\nmany thousand people were assembled to view the mournful spectacle.\r\nPresently a dreadful yell was heard, which struck the spectators with\r\nhorror, and a monstrous lion rushed out of a den, which was purposely\r\nset open, with erected mane and flaming eyes, and jaws that gaped like\r\nan open sepulchre. A mournful silence instantly prevailed. All eyes\r\nwere turned upon the destined victim, whose destruction seemed\r\ninevitable. But the pity of the multitude was soon converted into\r\nastonishment, when they beheld the lion, instead of destroying its\r\ndefenceless enemy, crouch submissively at his feet, fawn upon him as a\r\nfaithful dog would do upon his master, and rejoice over him as a mother\r\nthat unexpectedly recovers her offspring. The governor of the town, who\r\nwas present, then called out with a loud voice, and ordered Androcles to\r\nexplain to them this unintelligible mystery, and how a savage of the\r\nfiercest and most unpitying nature should thus in a moment have\r\nforgotten his innate disposition, and be converted into a harmless and\r\ninoffensive animal. Androcles then related to the assembly every\r\ncircumstance of his adventures, and concluded by saying, that the very\r\nlion which now stood before them, had been his friend and entertainer in\r\nthe woods. All present were astonished and delighted with the story, to\r\nfind that even the fiercest beasts are capable of being softened by\r\ngratitude; and, being moved by humanity, they unanimously joined to\r\nentreat for the pardon of the unhappy man, from the governor of the\r\nplace. This was immediately granted to him, and he was also presented\r\nwith the lion, which had twice saved the life of Androcles."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a delightful story, Uncle Thomas! What a pity it is that it is\r\nnot true."\r\n\r\n"I can tell you one which is true, John which is hardly, if at all,\r\ninferior in interest:--\r\n\r\n"Sir George Davis, who was English consul at Naples about the middle of\r\nthe seventeenth century, happening on one ocassion to be in Florence,\r\nvisited the Menagerie of the Grand Duke. At the farther end of one of\r\nthe dens he saw a lion which lay in sullen majesty, and which the\r\nkeepers informed him they had been unable to tame, although every effort\r\nhad been used for upwards of three years. Sir George had no sooner\r\nreached the gate of the den, than the lion ran to it, and evinced every\r\ndemonstration of joy and transport. The animal reared himself up, purred\r\nlike a cat when pleased, and licked the hand of Sir George, which he had\r\nput through the bars. The keeper was astonished and frightened for the\r\nsafety of his visitor, entreated him not to trust an apparent fit of\r\nfrenzy, with which the animal seemed to be seized; for he was, without\r\nexception, the most fierce and sullen of his tribe which he had ever\r\nseen. This, however, had no effect on Sir George, who, notwithstanding\r\nevery entreaty on the part of the keeper, insisted on entering the\r\nlion\'s den. The moment he got in, the delighted lion threw his paws upon\r\nhis shoulders, licked his face, and ran about him, rubbing his head on\r\nSir George, purring and fawning like a cat when expressing its affection\r\nfor its master. This occurrence became the talk of Florence, and reached\r\nthe ears of the Grand Duke, who sent for Sir George, and requested an\r\ninterview at the menagerie, that he might witness so extraordinary a\r\ncircumstance, when Sir George gave the following explanation; \'A\r\ncaptain of a ship from Barbary gave me this lion, when quite a whelp. I\r\nbrought him up tame; but when I thought him too large to be suffered to\r\nrun about the house, I built a den for him in my court-yard. From that\r\ntime he was never permitted to be loose, except when brought to the\r\nhouse to be exhibited to my friends. When he was five years old, he did\r\nsome mischief by pawing and playing with people in his frolicsome moods.\r\nHaving griped a man one day a little too hard, I ordered him to be shot,\r\nfor fear of myself incurring the guilt of what might happen. On this a\r\nfriend, who happened to be then at dinner with me, begged him as a\r\npresent. How he came here, I know not.\' The Grand Duke of Tuscany, on\r\nhearing his story, said it was the very same person who had presented\r\nhim with the lion."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Uncle Thomas: I should have been terribly afraid to have ventured\r\ninto the lion\'s den!"\r\n\r\n"I dare say you would, John, and so should I. But some stories are\r\nrecorded of the gentleness of the lion, as almost to justify such acts\r\nof what would otherwise appear fool-hardiness.\r\n\r\n"Part of a ship\'s crew being sent ashore on the coast of India for the\r\npurpose of cutting wood, the curiosity of one of the men having led him\r\nto stray to a considerable distance from his companions, he was much\r\nalarmed by the appearance of a large lioness, who made towards him; but,\r\non her coming up, his fear was allayed, by her lying down at his feet,\r\nand looking very earnestly, first in his face, and then at a tree some\r\nlittle distance off. After repeating these looks several times, she\r\narose, and proceeded towards the tree, looking back, as if she wished\r\nthe sailor to follow her. At length he ventured, and, coming to the\r\ntree, perceived a huge baboon, with two young cubs in her arms, which he\r\nimmediately supposed to be those of the lioness\', as she crouched down\r\nlike a cat, and seemed to eye them very stedfastly. The man being afraid\r\nto ascend the tree, decided on cutting it down, and having his axe\r\nwith him, he set actively to work, when the lioness seemed most\r\nattentive to what he was doing. When the tree fell, she pounced upon the\r\nbaboon, and, after tearing her in pieces, she turned round, and licked\r\nthe cubs for some time. She then returned to the sailor, and fawned\r\nround him, rubbing her head against him in great fondness, and in token\r\nof her gratitude for the service done her. After this, she carried the\r\ncubs away one by one, and the sailor rejoined his companions, much\r\npleased with the adventure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LIONESS AND THE BABOON--Page 117.]\r\n\r\n"Another author tells such a graphic story of a lion\'s entertaining a\r\nhunter, that I must let you hear it also, though I must say that I think\r\nhe has rather overstrained it.\r\n\r\n"A hunter on one occasion having gone in search of a lion, and having\r\npenetrated a considerable distance into a forest, happened to meet with\r\ntwo whelps of a lion that came to caress him. The hunter stopped with\r\nthe little animals, and waiting for the coming of the sire or the dam,\r\ntook out his breakfast, and gave them a part. The lioness arrived,\r\nunperceived by the huntsman, so that he had not time, or perhaps wanted\r\nthe courage, to take his gun. After having for some time looked at the\r\nman who was thus feasting her young, the lioness burst away, and soon\r\nafter returned, bearing with her a sheep, which she came and laid at the\r\nhuntsman\'s feet. The hunter, thus become one of the family, took\r\noccasion to make a good meal,--skinned the sheep, made a fire, and\r\nroasted a part, giving the entrails to the young. The lion, in his turn,\r\ncame also; and, as if respecting the rights of hospitality, showed no\r\ntokens whatever of ferocity. Their guest, the next day, having finished\r\nhis provisions, returned home, and came to a resolution never more to\r\nkill any of these animals, the noble generosity of which he had so fully\r\nexperienced. He stroked and caressed the whelps at taking leave of them,\r\nand the dam and sire accompanied him till he was safely out of the\r\nforest."\r\n\r\n"Well, Uncle Thomas, I cannot believe that. I think the man would have\r\nbeen too glad to escape, to have staid so long with such unsafe\r\ncompanions."\r\n\r\n"You are quite right, Harry, I cannot expect that you should give credit\r\nto a story which I myself disbelieve. Here is a story about the ferocity\r\nof the lion, which is, however, beyond all, doubt.\r\n\r\n"In the year 1816 the horses which were dragging the Exeter mail coach\r\nwere attacked in the most furious manner by a lioness, which had escaped\r\nfrom a travelling menagerie.\r\n\r\n"At the moment when the coachman pulled up, to deliver his bags at one\r\nof the stages a few miles from the town of Salisbury, one of the leading\r\nhorses was suddenly seized by a ferocious animal. This produced a great\r\nconfusion and alarm. Two passengers, who were inside the mail, got out\r\nand ran into the house. The horse kicked and plunged violently; and it\r\nwas with difficulty the driver could prevent the coach from being\r\noverturned. It was soon observed by the coachman and guard, by the light\r\nof the lamps, that the animal which had seized the horse was a huge\r\nlioness. A large mastiff dog came up and attacked her fiercely, on which\r\nshe quitted the horse and turned upon him. The dog fled, but was pursued\r\nand killed by the lioness, within about forty yards of the place. It\r\nappears that the beast had escaped from a caravan, which was standing on\r\nthe road side, and belonged to a menagerie, on its way to Salisbury\r\nfair. An alarm being given, the keepers pursued and hunted the lioness,\r\ncarrying the dog in her teeth, into a hovel under a granary, which\r\nserved for keeping agricultural implements. About half past eight, they\r\nhad secured her effectually, by barricading the place, so as to prevent\r\nher escape. The horse, when first attacked, fought with great spirit;\r\nand if he had been at liberty, would probably have beaten down his\r\nantagonist with his fore feet but in plunging he entangled himself in\r\nthe harness. The lioness, it appears, attacked him in front, and\r\nspringing at his throat, had fastened the talons of her fore feet on\r\neach side of his gullet, close to the head, while the talons of her hind\r\nfeet were forced into the chest. In this situation she hung, while the\r\nblood was seen streaming, as if a vein had been opened by a lancet. The\r\nfurious animal missed the throat and jugular vein; but the horse was so\r\ndreadfully torn, that he was not at first expected to survive. The\r\nexpressions of agony, in his tears and moans, were most piteous and\r\naffecting. Whether the lioness was afraid of her prey being taken from\r\nher, or from some other cause, she continued a considerable time after\r\nshe had entered the hovel, roaring in a dreadful manner, so loud,\r\nindeed, that she was distinctly heard at the distance of half a mile.\r\nShe was eventually secured and led back in triumph to her cell."\r\n\r\n"It was fortunate that it did not attack the passengers, Uncle Thomas."\r\n\r\n"Very much so, indeed; it might have turned out a very serious affair,\r\nFrank."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     Uncle Thomas tells about the Tiger; its Ferocity and Power; and of\r\n     the Curious Modes which are adopted for its Capture and\r\n     Destruction.--Also about the Puma or American Lion, and introduces\r\n     some Hunting Scenes in North and South America, with other\r\n     Interesting and Entertaining Adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Long as the stories were, Boys, which I told you last night about the\r\nlion, I have not yet quite done with the animals of the cat kind; there\r\nare still one or two stories about the tiger and the puma or American\r\nlion, which I wish to tell you of, if you do not think we have already\r\nhad enough of them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Uncle Thomas, pray do continue."\r\n\r\n"Very well, I will first tell you about the tiger.\r\n\r\n"The tiger, which inhabits the rich jungles of India, nearly equals the\r\nlion in strength, and perhaps excels him in activity and ferocity. A\r\nvery affecting instance of his ferocity, by which a fine young man, the\r\nonly son of Sir Hector Munro, lost his life, is thus related by one of\r\nthe party:\r\n\r\n"Yesterday morning, Captain George Downey, Lieutenant Pyefinch, poor Mr.\r\nMunro (of the Honourable East India Company\'s service), and myself\r\n(Captain Consar), went on shore, on Saugur Island, to shoot deer. We saw\r\ninnumerable tracks of tigers and deer; but still we were induced to\r\npursue our sport; and did so the whole day. About half past three, we\r\nsat down on the edge of the jungle, to eat some cold meat, sent to us\r\nfrom the ship, and had just commenced our meal, when Mr. Pyefinch and a\r\nblack servant told us there was a fine deer within six yards of us.\r\nCaptain Downey and I immediately jumped up, to take our guns; mine was\r\nnearest, and I had but just laid hold of it, when I heard a roar like\r\nthunder, and saw an immense royal tiger spring on the unfortunate Munro,\r\nwho was sitting down; in a moment his head was in the beast\'s mouth, and\r\nhe rushed into the jungle with him, with as much ease as I could lift a\r\nkitten, tearing him through the thickest bushes and trees, every thing\r\nyielding to his monstrous strength. The agonies of horror, regret, and,\r\nI must say, fear (for there were two tigers), rushed on me at once; the\r\nonly effort I could make was to fire at him, though the poor youth was\r\nstill in his mouth. I relied partly on Providence, partly on my own aim,\r\nand fired a musket. The tiger staggered, and seemed agitated, which I\r\ntook notice of to my companions. Captain Downey then fired two shots,\r\nand I one more. We retired from the jungle, and, a few minutes after,\r\nMr. Munro came up to us all over blood and fell. We took him on our\r\nbacks to the boat, and got every medical assistance for him from the\r\nValentine Indiaman, which lay at anchor near the Island; but in vain. He\r\nlived twenty-four hours in the utmost torture; his head and skull were\r\nall torn and broken to pieces, and he was also wounded, by the animal\'s\r\nclaws, all over his neck and shoulders; but it was better to take him\r\naway, though irrecoverable, than leave him to be mangled and devoured.\r\nWe have just read the funeral service over his body, and committed it to\r\nthe deep. Mr. Munro was an amiable and promising youth. I must observe,\r\nthere was a large fire blazing close to us, composed of ten or a dozen\r\nwhole trees. I made it myself on purpose to keep the tigers off, as I\r\nhad always heard it would. There were eight or ten of the natives about\r\nus; many shots had been fired at the place; there was much noise and\r\nlaughing at the time; but this ferocious animal disregarded all. The\r\nhuman mind cannot form an idea of the scene; it turned my very soul\r\nwithin me. The beast was about four feet and a half high, and nine long.\r\nHis head appeared as large as that of an ox; his eyes darting fire, and\r\nhis roar, when he first seized his prey, will never be out of my\r\nrecollection. We had scarcely pushed our boat from that cursed shore,\r\nwhen the tigress made her appearance, raging, almost mad, and remained\r\non the sand, as long as the distance would allow me to see her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dreadful, Uncle Thomas! I declare it makes my hair stand on end!"\r\n\r\n"It is a fearful tale, John, and shows you what a scourge such an animal\r\nmust be to the inhabitants of the country in which it is found. It\r\nfrequents the deserts of Asia, but in some places where civilization has\r\ncommenced, it prowls about the villages and commits great havoc among\r\nthe herds of the inhabitants, who therefore find it necessary to adopt\r\nvarious schemes for its destruction; some of these devices are very\r\ncurious.\r\n\r\n"A large cage of strong bamboos is constructed, and fastened firmly to\r\nthe ground, in a place which the tigers frequent. In this a man takes up\r\nhis station for the night. He is generally accompanied by a dog or a\r\ngoat, which by its extreme agitation is sure to give notice of the\r\ntiger\'s approach. His weapons consist of two or three strong spears, and\r\nthus provided he wraps himself in his quilt, and very composedly goes to\r\nsteep in the full confidence of safety. By and by the tiger makes his\r\nappearance, and after duly reconnoitring all round, begins to rear\r\nagainst the cage, seeking for some means of entering. The hunter, who\r\nwatches his opportunity, thrusts one of his spears into the animal\'s\r\nbody, and seldom fails to destroy it."\r\n\r\n"That is a very good plan, Uncle Thomas, and does not seem to be\r\nattended with much danger, if the cage be strong enough."\r\n\r\n"No, Boys, it is not very dangerous, but I don\'t think any of you would\r\nlike to trust yourselves so exposed. Here, however, is another mode of\r\ndestroying the tiger, which is practised in some parts of India.\r\n\r\n"The track of a tiger being ascertained, which though not invariably the\r\nsame, may yet be known sufficiently for the purpose, the peasants\r\ncollect a quantity of the leaves of the prous, which are like those of\r\nthe sycamore, and are common in most underwoods, as they form the\r\nlargest portion of most jungles in India. These leaves are smeared with\r\na species of bird-lime, made by bruising the berries of a tree by no\r\nmeans scarce. They are then strewed, with the gluten uppermost, near to\r\nthe spot to which it is understood the tiger usually retires during\r\nnoon-tide heat. If by chance the animal should tread on one of these\r\nsmeared leaves his fate is certain. He commences by shaking his paw,\r\nwith the view to remove the adhesive incumbrance, but finding no relief\r\nfrom that expedient, he rubs the nuisance against his jaw with the same\r\nintention, by which means his eyes, ears, &c. become covered with the\r\nsame substance. This occasions such uneasiness as causes him to roll\r\nperhaps among many more smeared leaves, till at length he becomes\r\ncompletely enveloped, and he is deprived of sight, and in this situation\r\nmay be compared to a man who has been tarred and feathered. The anxiety\r\nproduced by this strange and novel predicament, soon discovers itself in\r\ndreadful howlings, which serve to call the watchful peasants, who in\r\nthis disabled state find no difficulty in shooting the object of\r\ndetestation."\r\n\r\n"That is better still, Uncle Thomas; I think that is the most ingenious\r\nway of catching an animal that I ever heard of."\r\n\r\n"I must now tell you something about the puma or American lion, which is\r\nalso taken in a very ingenious manner by the natives of South America.\r\nIt is generally hunted by means of dogs. When they unkennel a lion or a\r\ntiger, they pursue him till he stops to defend himself. The hunter, who\r\nis mounted on a good steed, follows close behind, and if the dogs seize\r\nupon the animal, the hunter jumps off his horse, and, while the lion is\r\nengaged in contending with the dogs, strikes him on the head, and thus\r\ndispatches him. If, however, the dogs are afraid to attack him, the\r\nhunter uses his lasso, dexterously fixes it round some part of the\r\nanimal, and gallops away, dragging it after him. The dogs now rush in\r\nand tear him, when he is soon dispatched.\r\n\r\n"When wounded the puma grows furious and irresistible. Here is a story\r\nwhich shows the fierceness of the animal:--Two hunters having gone in\r\nquest of game to the Catskill mountains, province of New York, each\r\narmed with a gun, and accompanied by a dog, they agreed to go in\r\ncontrary directions round the base of the hill, which formed one of the\r\npoints of that chain of mountains; and it was settled that, if either\r\ndischarged his piece, the other should hasten to the spot whence the\r\nreport proceeded as speedily as possible, to join in the pursuit of\r\nwhatever game might fall to their lot. They had not been long asunder,\r\nwhen the one heard the other fire, and, agreeably to promise, hastened\r\nto join his companion. He looked for him in every direction; but to no\r\npurpose. At length, however, he came upon the dog of his friend, dead,\r\nand dreadfully lacerated. Convinced by this, that the animal his comrade\r\nhad shot at was ferocious and formidable, he felt much alarm for his\r\nfate, and sought after him with great anxiety. He had not proceeded many\r\nyards from me spot where the dog lay prostrate, when his attention was\r\narrested by the ferocious growl of some wild animal. On raising his\r\neyes to the spot whence the sound proceeded, he discovered a large puma\r\ncouching on the branch of a tree, and under him the body of his friend.\r\nThe animal\'s eyes glared at him, and he appeared hesitating whether he\r\nshould descend, and make an attack on the survivor also, or relinquish\r\nhis prey, and decamp. The hunter, aware of the celerity of the puma\'s\r\nmovements, knew that there was no time for reflection, levelled his\r\npiece, and mortally wounded the animal, when it and the body of the man\r\nfell together from the tree. His dog then attacked the wounded puma, but\r\na single blow from its paw laid it prostrate. In this state of things,\r\nfinding his comrade was dead, and knowing it was dangerous to approach\r\nthe wounded animal, he went in search of assistance, and on returning to\r\nthe spot he found his companion, the puma, and the two dogs, all lying\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n"The celebrated naturalist Audubon gives an interesting account of a\r\nhunt which he had after the puma, in one of the back settlements of\r\nNorth America. In the course of his rambles he arrived at the cabin of a\r\nsquatter on the banks of Cold-Water River, and after a hospitable\r\nreception, and an evening spent in relating their adventures in the\r\nchase, it was agreed in the morning to hunt the puma which had of late\r\nbeen making sad ravages among the squatter\'s pigs.\r\n\r\n"The hunters accordingly made their appearance just as the sun was\r\nemerging from the horizon. They were five in number, and fully equipped\r\nfor the chase, being mounted on horses which in some parts of Europe\r\nmight appear sorry nags, but which, in strength, speed, and bottom, are\r\nbetter fitted for pursuing a puma or bear through woods and morasses\r\nthan any in that country. A pack of large ugly curs were already engaged\r\nin making acquaintance with those of the squatter. He and myself mounted\r\nhis two best horses, whilst his sons were bestriding others of inferior\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n"Few words were uttered by the party until we had reached the edge of\r\nthe swamp where it was agreed that all should disperse and seek for the\r\nfresh track of the puma, it being previously settled that the discoverer\r\nshould blow his horn, and remain on the spot until the rest should join\r\nhim. In less than an hour, the sound of the horn was clearly heard, and,\r\nsticking close the squatter, off we went through the thick woods, guided\r\nonly by the moon and the repeated call of the distant huntsman. We soon\r\nreached the spot, and in a short time the rest of the party came up. The\r\nbest dog was sent forward to attack the animal, and in a few minutes the\r\nwhole pack were observed diligently tracking and bearing in their course\r\nfor the interior of the swamp. The rifles were immediately put in trim,\r\nand the party followed the dogs at separate distances, within sight of\r\neach other, determined to shoot at no other game than the puma.\r\n\r\n"The dogs soon began to mouth, and suddenly quickened their pace. My\r\ncompanions concluded that the beast was on the ground, and putting our\r\nhorses to a gentle gallop, we followed the curs, guided by their voices.\r\nThe noise of the dogs increased, when all of a sudden their mode of\r\nbarking became altered, and the squatter, urging me to push on, told me\r\nthe beast was _treed_, by which he meant that it had got upon some low\r\nbranch of a large tree, to rest for a few moments, and that should we\r\nnot succeed in shooting him while thus situated we might expect a long\r\nchase of it. As we approached the spot, we all by degrees united into a\r\nbody, but on seeing the dogs at the foot of a large tree, separated\r\nagain, and galloped off to surround it.\r\n\r\n"Each hunter now moved with caution, holding his gun ready, and allowing\r\nthe bridle to dangle on the neck of his horse, as it advanced slowly\r\ntowards the dogs. A shot from one of the party was heard, on which the\r\npuma was seen to leap to the ground and bound off with such velocity as\r\nto show that he was very unwilling to stand our fire longer. The dogs\r\nset off in pursuit with the utmost eagerness and a deafening cry; the\r\nhunter who had fired came up, and said that his ball had hit the\r\nmonster, and had probably broken one of his fore legs near the shoulder,\r\nthe only place at which he could aim; a slight trail of blood was\r\ndiscovered on the ground, but the curs proceeded at such a rate, that we\r\nmerely noticed this and put spurs to our horses, which galloped on\r\ntowards the centre of the swamp. One bayou (a part of the swamp in which\r\nthe water accumulates) was crossed, then another still larger and more\r\nmuddy, but the dogs were brushing forward, and as the horses began to\r\npant at a furious rate, we judged it expedient to leave them and advance\r\non foot. These determined hunters knew that the animal, being wounded,\r\nwould shortly ascend another tree, where in all probability he would\r\nremain for a considerable time, and that it was easy to follow the track\r\nof the dogs. We dismounted, took off the saddles and bridles, set the\r\nbells attached to the horses, necks at liberty to jingle, hoppled the\r\nanimals (fastening the bridle to one of their legs so that they could\r\nnot stray far), and left them to shift for themselves.\r\n\r\n"After marching for a couple of hours, we again heard the dogs. Each of\r\nus pressed forward, elated at the thought of terminating the career of\r\nthe puma; some of the dogs were heard whining, although the greater part\r\nbarked vehemently. We felt assured that the animal was treed, and that\r\nhe would rest for some time to recover from his fatigue. As we came up\r\nto the dogs we discovered the furious animal lying across a large branch\r\nclose to the trunk of a cotton-wood tree. His broad breast lay towards\r\nus, his eyes were at one time bent on us, and again on the dogs,\r\nbeneath, and around him; one of his fore-legs hung down loosely by his\r\nside, and he lay crouched with his ears lowered close to his head, as if\r\nhe thought he might remain undiscovered. Three balls were fired at him\r\nat a given signal, on which he sprung a few feet from the branch, and\r\ntumbled headlong to the ground. Attacked on all sides by the enraged\r\ncurs, the infuriated animal fought with desperate valour; but the\r\nsquatter advancing in front of the party, and almost in the midst of the\r\ndogs, shot him immediately behind and beneath the left shoulder. He\r\nwrithed for a moment in agony, and in another lay dead."\r\n\r\n"It must be very exciting employment, hunting the puma, Uncle Thomas."\r\n\r\n"And not a little dangerous too, Boys, for you hear how fiercely he\r\nmaintains his ground. With all their fierceness, however, the fear of\r\nman is over even this relentless race of animals. Captain Head, who has\r\nwritten an amusing book called \'Rough Notes of Rapid Rides across the\r\nPampas,\' thus speaks on this subject:\r\n\r\n"The fear which all wild animals in America have of man is very\r\nsingularly exhibited in the Pampas. I often rode towards the ostriches\r\nand zamas, crouching under the opposite side of my horse\'s neck; but I\r\nalways found that, although they would allow my loose horse to approach\r\nthem, they, even when young, ran from me, though little of my figure was\r\nvisible; and when I saw them all enjoying themselves in such full\r\nliberty, it was at first not pleasing to observe that one\'s appearance\r\nwas every where a signal to them that they should fly from their enemy.\r\nYet it is by this fear \'that man hath dominion over the beasts of the\r\nfield,\' and there is no animal in South America that does not\r\nacknowledge this instinctive feeling. As a singular proof of the above,\r\nand of the difference between the wild beasts of America and of the old\r\nworld, I will venture to relate a circumstance which a man sincerely\r\nassured me had happened to him in South America.\r\n\r\n"He was trying to shoot some wild ducks, and, in order to approach them\r\nunperceived, he put the corner of his poncho (which is a sort of long\r\nnarrow blanket) over his head, and crawling along the ground upon his\r\nhand and knees, the poncho not only covered his body, but trailed along\r\nthe ground behind him. As he was thus creeping by a large bush of\r\nreeds, he heard a loud, sudden noise, between a bark and a roar; he felt\r\nsomething heavy strike his feet, and, instantly jumping up, he saw to\r\nhis astonishment, a large puma actually standing on his poncho; and,\r\nperhaps, the animal was equally astonished to find himself in the\r\nimmediate presence of so athletic a man. The man told me he was\r\nunwilling to fire, as his gun was loaded with very small shot; and he\r\ntherefore remained motionless, the puma standing on his poncho for many\r\nseconds; at last the creature turned his head, and walking very slowly\r\naway about ten yards, stopped, and turned again: the man still\r\nmaintained his ground, upon which the puma tacitly acknowledged his\r\nsupremacy, and walked off."\r\n\r\n"I dare say the man was very glad to be so easily quit of such a\r\nformidable visitor, Uncle Thomas."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SURPRISE--Page 140.]\r\n\r\n"No doubt of it, Frank. I have one other story to tell you about the\r\npuma, which fortunately exhibits it in a more favourable light than\r\nsome of those which I have told you.\r\n\r\n"During the government of Don Diego de Mendoza, in Paraguay, a dreadful\r\nfamine raged at Buenos Ayres; yet Diego, afraid to give the Indians a\r\nhabit of spilling Spanish blood, forbade the inhabitants, on pain of\r\ndeath, to go into the fields, in search of relief, placing soldiers at\r\nall the outlets to the country, with orders to fire upon those who\r\nshould attempt to transgress his orders. A woman, however, called\r\nMaldonata, was artful enough to elude the vigilance of the guards, and\r\nto effect her escape. After wandering about the country for a long time,\r\nshe sought shelter in a cavern; but she had scarcely entered it, when\r\nshe became dreadfully alarmed, on observing a puma occupying the same\r\nden. She was, however, soon quieted by the animal approaching and\r\ncaressing her. The poor brute was very ill, and scarcely able to crawl\r\ntowards her. Maldonata soon discovered what was the cause of the\r\nanimal\'s illness, and kindly ministered to it. It soon recovered, and\r\nwas all gratitude and attention to its kind benefactress, never\r\nreturning from searching after its daily subsistence without laying a\r\nportion of it at the feet of Maldonata.\r\n\r\n"Some time after, Maldonata fell into the hands of the Spaniards; and,\r\nbeing brought back to Buenos Ayres, was conducted before Don Francis\r\nRuez de Galen, who then commanded there. She was charged with having\r\nleft the city contrary to orders. Galen was a man of a cruel and\r\ntyrannical disposition, and condemned the unfortunate woman to a death\r\nwhich none but the most cruel tyrant could have devised. He ordered some\r\nsoldiers to take her into the country, and leave her tied to a tree,\r\neither to perish with hunger, or to be torn to pieces by wild beasts.\r\nTwo days after, he sent the same soldiers to see what had been her fate,\r\nwhen, to their great surprise, they found her alive and unhurt, though\r\nsurrounded by pumas and jaguars, while a female puma at her feet kept\r\nthem at bay. As soon as the puma saw the soldiers, she retired to some\r\ndistance and they unbound Maldonata, who related to them the history of\r\nthis puma, whom she knew to be the same she had formerly relieved in the\r\ncavern. On the soldiers taking Maldonata away, the animal approached,\r\nand fawned upon her, as if unwilling to part. The soldiers reported what\r\nthey had seen to their commander, who could not but pardon a woman who\r\nhad been so singularly protected, without the danger of appearing more\r\ninhuman than pumas themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     Uncle Thomas tells about the Migrating Instinct of Animals.--Of the\r\n     House Swallow of England; and the Esculent Swallow, whose Nest is\r\n     eaten by the Chinese.--He tells also about the Passenger Pigeon of\r\n     America; of the Myriads which are found in various parts of the\r\n     United States; of the Land-Crab and its Migrations, and of those of\r\n     the Salmon and the Common Herring.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Uncle Thomas, I heard to-day of a swallow which for many years returned\r\nto the same window, and built its nest in the same corner. Now as I\r\nbelieve swallows are birds of passage, and leave this country to spend\r\nthe winter in warmer climates, I wish you to explain to me how it is\r\nthat they can return from such distances to the same spot."\r\n\r\n"That is a question, Frank, which I cannot very well answer, but so many\r\ninstances of the kind have been observed as to leave no doubt as to the\r\nfact. It has sometimes been known even to penetrate into the house, and\r\nattach its nest to articles of furniture.\r\n\r\n"At Camerton Hall, near Bath, a pair of swallows built their nest on the\r\nupper part of the frame of an old picture over the chimney; and, coming\r\ninto the room through a broken pane in one of the windows, they\r\ncontinued to use the same place for their nest for three successive\r\nyears, and would probably have continued to do so, but the room having\r\nbeen put into repair, they could no longer obtain access to it."\r\n\r\n"Is it want of food which makes birds migrate, Uncle Thomas?"\r\n\r\n"Principally, I should say that it is so, Frank, but in shifting from\r\none place to another they only fulfil an instinct impressed on them by\r\ntheir Creator for the preservation of their species. Thus, for instance,\r\nan old swallow might know by experience, that when its food fails here,\r\nit begins to become plentiful elsewhere, but the young bird which had\r\nnever been more than a few miles from the place where it was hatched,\r\ncan have no such experimental knowledge; yet, when the season arrives,\r\nwe find the whole flock ready to set out. I dare say you have all seen\r\nthem, Boys, gathering in flocks and resting on the house tops, as if\r\ntaking breath before setting out on their long journey."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Uncle Thomas, I have often seen them doing so, but I have\r\nheard that they dive to the bottom of lakes and ponds, and remain there\r\ntill winter is over."\r\n\r\n"Many foolish stories are told of swallows being found in such\r\nsituations, Harry, but they are now well known to be fables. There is no\r\ndoubt that they migrate in the same way as many other birds. Last autumn\r\nI watched with great pleasure the movements of a flock, which was\r\nevidently preparing for their arduous flight.\r\n\r\n"For several evenings they assembled in large numbers on a tree at a\r\nshort distance from my house, and, after remaining seated for some time,\r\none of them, who appeared to be commander-in-chief, kept flying about\r\nin all directions, and at length, with a sharp and loudly repeated call,\r\nhe darted up into the air. In an instant the whole congregation were on\r\nthe wing, following their leader in a sort of spiral track. In a little\r\ntime they had risen so high that I lost sight of them, but after a short\r\nabsence they again returned and took up their position on the tree which\r\nthey had just left.\r\n\r\n"This manoeuvre they continued for some time, till one day they set\r\noff in reality, and I saw no more of them for the winter."\r\n\r\n"I read, somewhere, Uncle Thomas, that the Chinese eat swallows\' nests.\r\nI cannot understand this, Sir; surely the mud and clay, of which\r\nswallows\' nests are composed, would make but an indifferent repast."\r\n\r\n"I dare say they would, Frank, if they were made of clay and mud, as the\r\nnests of our swallows are; but such is not the case. Various opinions\r\nare entertained as to the substance of which the nest of the esculent\r\nswallow is made. Sir George Staunton, who accompanied Lord Macartney in\r\nhis embassy to China, gives a very interesting account both of the\r\nswallow and of its nest.\r\n\r\n"In the Cass," says Sir George, "a small island near Sumatra, we found\r\ntwo caverns running horizontally into the side of the rock, and in these\r\nwere a number of those birds\' nests so much prized by the Chinese\r\nepicures. They seemed to be composed of fine filaments, cemented\r\ntogether by a transparent viscous matter, not unlike what is left by the\r\nfoam of the sea upon stones alternately covered by the tide, or those\r\ngelatinous animal substances found floating on every coast. The nests\r\nadhere to each other and to the sides of the cavern, mostly in\r\nhorizontal rows, without any break or interruption, and at different\r\ndepths from fifty to five hundred feet. The birds that build these nests\r\nare small grey swallows, with bellies of a dirty white. They were flying\r\nabout in considerable numbers, but were so small, and their flight was\r\nso quick, that they escaped the shot fired at them. The same sort of\r\nnests are said to be also found in deep caverns at the foot of the\r\nhighest mountains in the middle of Java, at a distance from the sea;\r\nfrom which source it is thought that the birds derive no materials,\r\neither for their food, or the construction of their nests, as it does\r\nnot appear probable they should fly in search of either over the\r\nintermediate mountains, which are very high, or against the boisterous\r\nwinds prevailing thereabouts. They feed on insects, which they find\r\nhovering over stagnated pools between the mountains, and for the\r\ncatching of which their wide opening beaks are particularly adapted.\r\nThey prepare their nests from the best remnants of their food. Their\r\ngreatest enemy is the kite, who often intercepts them in their passage\r\nto and from the caverns, which are generally surrounded with rocks of\r\ngrey limestone or white marble. The colour and value of the nests depend\r\non the quantity and quality of the insects caught, and perhaps also on\r\nthe situation where they are built. Their value is chiefly ascertained\r\nby the uniform fineness and delicacy of their texture; those that are\r\nwhite and transparent being most esteemed, and fetching often in China\r\ntheir weight in silver.\r\n\r\n"These nests are a considerable object of traffic among the Javanese,\r\nmany of whom are employed in it from their infancy. The birds, after\r\nhaving spent nearly two months in preparing their nests, lay each two\r\neggs, which are hatched in about fifteen days. When the young birds\r\nbecome fledged, it is thought the proper time to seize upon their nests,\r\nwhich is done regularly three times a year, and is effected by means of\r\nladders of bamboo and reeds, by which the people descend into the\r\ncaverns; but when these are very deep, rope-ladders are preferred. This\r\noperation is attended with much danger, and several perish in the\r\nattempt. The inhabitants of the mountains generally employed in this\r\nbusiness begin always by sacrificing a buffalo, which custom is observed\r\nby the Javanese on the eve of every extraordinary enterprise. They also\r\npronounce some prayers, anoint themselves with sweet-scented oil, and\r\nsmoke the entrance of the cavern with gumbenjamin. Near some of the\r\ncaverns a tutelar goddess is worshipped, whose priest burns incense, and\r\nlays his projecting hands on every person preparing to descend. A\r\nflambeau is carefully prepared at the same time, with a gum which exudes\r\nfrom a tree growing in the vicinity, and which is not easily\r\nextinguished by fixed air or subterraneous vapours."\r\n\r\n"But how are the nests eaten, Uncle Thomas? Are they prepared in any\r\nway, or are they fit for use as they are taken down?"\r\n\r\n"They are always prepared before they are eaten. The finest sort, which\r\nare of a clear colour, and not unlike isinglass, are dissolved in broth,\r\nto which they are said to give an exquisite flavour. After being soaked,\r\nthey are sometimes introduced into the body of a fowl and stewed; but I\r\nam not quite versed in all the mysteries of a Chinese kitchen, so you\r\nmust be satisfied with these two modes of preparation."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Uncle Thomas."\r\n\r\n"I have only one more story to tell you about the swallow, Boys, and\r\nthen I must turn to two or three other animals, whose peregrinations\r\nexhibit as strong instances of instinct as it does."\r\n\r\n"A swallow\'s nest, built in the west corner of a window facing the\r\nnorth, was so much softened by the rain beating against it, that it was\r\nrendered unfit to support the superincumbent load of five pretty full\r\ngrown swallows. During a storm the nest fell into the tower corner of\r\nthe window, leaving the young brood exposed to all the fury of the\r\nblast. To save the little creatures from an untimely death, the owner of\r\nthe house benevolently caused a covering to be thrown over them, till\r\nthe severity of the storm was past. No sooner had it subsided, than the\r\nsages of the colony assembled, fluttering round the window, and hovering\r\nover the temporary covering of the fallen nest. As soon as this careful\r\nanxiety was observed, the covering was removed, and the utmost joy\r\nevinced by the group, on finding the young ones alive and unhurt. After\r\nfeeding them, the members of this assembled community arranged\r\nthemselves into working order. Each division taking its appropriate\r\nstation, commenced instantly to work, and before night-fall they had\r\njointly completed an arched canopy over the young brood in the corner\r\nwhere they lay, and securely covered them against a succeeding blast.\r\nCalculating the time occupied by them in performing this piece of\r\narchitecture, it appeared evident that the young must have perished from\r\ncold and hunger, before any single pair could have executed half the\r\njob."\r\n\r\n"How very kind, Uncle Thomas! Had they been reasoning creatures, they\r\ncould not have behaved more properly."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not, Frank. Such traits overstep the limits of _instinct_,\r\nand almost trespass on that of reason."\r\n\r\n"You asked, Frank, if it was want of food which prompted the flight of\r\nmigratory animals from one place to another. In some cases it is so,\r\nundoubtedly; as for instance, in that which I am now going to tell you\r\nabout, the American passenger pigeon; it is from the work of the great\r\nnaturalist, Wilson.\r\n\r\n"The migrations of these pigeons appear to be undertaken rather in quest\r\nof food than merely to avoid the cold of the climate; since we find them\r\nlingering in the northern regions around Hudson\'s Bay so late as\r\nDecember, and since their appearance is so casual and irregular,\r\nsometimes not visiting certain districts for several years in any\r\nconsiderable numbers, while at other times they are innumerable. I have\r\noften witnessed these migrations in the Genesee country, often in\r\nPennsylvania, and also in various parts of Virginia, with amazement; but\r\nall that I have seen of them are mere straggling parties, when compared\r\nwith the congregated millions which I have since beheld in the western\r\nforests in the states of Ohio, Kentucky, and the Indiana territory.\r\nThese fertile and extensive regions abound with the nutritious beech\r\nnut, which constitutes the chief food of the wild pigeon. In seasons\r\nwhen these nuts are abundant, corresponding multitudes of pigeons may be\r\nconfidently expected. It sometimes happens, that having consumed the\r\nwhole produce of the beech trees in an extensive district, they discover\r\nanother at the distance of perhaps sixty or eighty miles, to which they\r\nregularly repair every morning, and return as regularly in the course of\r\nthe day, or in the evening, to their place of general rendezvous, or, as\r\nit is generally called, the roosting place. These roosting places are\r\nalways in the wood, and sometimes occupy a large extent of forest. When\r\nthey have frequented one of these places for some time, the appearance\r\nit exhibits is surprising. The ground is covered to the depth of several\r\ninches with their droppings; all the tender grass and underwood\r\ndestroyed; the surface strewed with large limbs of trees, broken down\r\nby the weight of the birds clustering one above another, and the trees\r\nthemselves, for thousand of acres, killed as completely as if girdled\r\nwith an axe. The marks of this desolation remain for many years on the\r\nspot, and numerous places could be pointed out, where for several years\r\nafter scarcely a single vegetable made its appearance.\r\n\r\n"When these roosts are first discovered, the inhabitants from\r\nconsiderable distances visit them in the night with guns, clubs, long\r\npoles, pots of sulphur, and various other engines of destruction. In a\r\nfew hours they fill many sacks, and load their horses with them. By the\r\nIndians, a pigeon roost or breeding place is considered an important\r\nsource of national profit and dependence for the season, and all their\r\nactive ingenuity is exercised on the occasion. The breeding place\r\ndiffers from the former in its greater extent. In the western countries\r\nbefore mentioned, these are generally in beech woods, and often extend\r\nin nearly a straight line across the country for a great way. Not far\r\nfrom Shelbyville, in the state of Kentucky, about five years ago, there\r\nwas one of these breeding places, which stretched through the woods in\r\nnearly a north and south direction, which was several miles in breadth,\r\nand was said to be upwards of forty miles in extent. In this tract\r\nalmost every tree was furnished with nests wherever the branches could\r\naccommodate them. The pigeons made their first appearance there about\r\nthe 10th of April, and left it altogether with their young before the\r\n25th of May.\r\n\r\n"As soon as the young were fully grown, and before they left the nests,\r\nnumerous parties of the inhabitants, from all parts of the adjacent\r\ncountry, came with waggons, axes, beds, cooking utensils, many of them\r\naccompanied by the greater part of their families, and encamped for\r\nseveral days in this immense nursery. Several of them informed me that\r\nthe noise in the woods was so great as to terrify their horses, and that\r\nit was difficult for one person to hear another speak without bawling\r\nin his ear. The ground was strewed with broken limbs of trees, eggs, and\r\nyoung squab pigeons which had been precipitated from above, and on which\r\nherds of hogs were fattening; hawks, buzzards, and eagles were sailing\r\nabout in great numbers, and seizing the squabs from their nests at\r\npleasure; while from twenty feet upwards to the tops of the trees, the\r\nview through the woods presented a perpetual tumult of crowding and\r\nfluttering multitudes of pigeons, their wings roaring like thunder,\r\nmingled with the frequent crash of falling timber; for now the axemen\r\nwere at work, cutting down those trees which seemed to be most crowded\r\nwith nests, and contrived to fell them in such a manner, that in their\r\ndescent they might bring down several others, by which means the falling\r\nof one large tree sometimes produced two hundred squabs, little inferior\r\nin size to the old pigeons, and almost one mass of fat. On some single\r\ntrees, upwards of one hundred nests were found, each containing one\r\nyoung only, a circumstance in the history of this bird not generally\r\nknown to naturalists. It was dangerous to walk under these fluttering\r\nand flying millions, from the frequent fall of large branches, broken\r\ndown by the weight of the multitudes above, and which in their descent\r\noften destroyed numbers of the birds themselves.\r\n\r\n"I had left the public road to visit the remains of the breeding place\r\nnear Shelbyville, and was traversing the woods with my gun on my way to\r\nFrankfort, when about one o\'clock, the pigeons which I had observed\r\nflying the greater part of the morning northerly, began to return in\r\nsuch immense numbers as I never before had witnessed; coming to an\r\nopening by the side of a creek called the Benson, where I had a more\r\nuninterrupted view, I was astonished at their appearance. They were\r\nflying with great steadiness and rapidity, at a height beyond gun-shot,\r\nand several strata deep, and so close together, that could shot have\r\nreached them, one discharge could not have failed in bringing down\r\nseveral individuals. From right to left as far as the eye could reach,\r\nthe breadth of this vast procession extended, seeming every where\r\nequally crowded. Curious to determine how long this appearance would\r\ncontinue, I took out my watch to note time, and sat down to observe\r\nthem. It was then half-past one; I sat for more than an hour, but\r\ninstead of a diminution of this prodigious procession, it seemed rather\r\nto increase both in numbers and rapidity, and anxious to reach Frankfort\r\nbefore night, I arose and went on. About four o\'clock in the afternoon,\r\nI crossed the Kentucky river at the town of Frankfort, at which time the\r\nliving torrent above my head seemed as numerous and as extensive as\r\never; and long after this, I observed them in large bodies that\r\ncontinued to pass for six or eight minutes, and these again were\r\nfollowed by other detached bodies, all moving in the same south-east\r\ndirection, till after six in the evening. The great breadth of front\r\nwhich this mighty multitude preserved would seem to intimate a\r\ncorresponding breadth of their breeding place, which, by several\r\ngentlemen who had lately passed through part of it, was stated to me at\r\nseveral miles. It was said to be in Green County, and that the young\r\nbegan to fly about the middle of March. On the 17th of April, forty-nine\r\nmiles beyond Danville, and not far from Green River, I crossed this same\r\nbreeding place, where the nests for more than three miles spotted every\r\ntree; the leaves not being yet out, I had a fair prospect of them, and\r\nwas really astonished at their numbers. A few bodies of pigeons lingered\r\nyet in different parts of the woods, the roaring of whose wings was\r\nheard in various quarters around me.\r\n\r\n"The vast quantity of food which these multitudes consume is a serious\r\nloss to the other animals, such as bears, pigs, squirrels, which are\r\ndependent on the fruits of the forest. I have taken from the crop of a\r\nsingle wild pigeon a good handful of the kernels of beech nuts\r\nintermixed with acorns and chesnuts. To form a rough estimate of the\r\ndaily consumption of one of these immense flocks, let us first attempt\r\nto calculate the numbers above mentioned, as seen in passing between\r\nFrankfort and the Indian Territory. If we suppose this column to have\r\nbeen one mile in breadth (and I believe it to have been much more), and\r\nthat it moved at the rate of one mile in a minute, four hours, the time\r\nit continued passing, would make its whole length two hundred and forty\r\nmiles. Again, supposing that each square yard of this moving body\r\ncomprehended three pigeons, the square yards in the whole space,\r\nmultiplied by three, would give two thousand two hundred and thirty\r\nmillions two hundred and seventy-two thousand pigeons!--an almost\r\nincredible multitude, and yet far below the actual amount. Computing\r\neach of these to consume half a pint of mast (nuts, and other seeds of\r\ntrees) daily, the whole quantity, at this rate, would equal seventeen\r\nmillions four hundred and twenty-four thousand bushels per day! Heaven\r\nhas wisely and graciously given to these birds rapidity of flight, and a\r\ndisposition to range over vast uncultivated tracts of the earth;\r\notherwise they must have perished in the districts where they resided,\r\nor devoured the whole productions of agriculture, as well as those of\r\nthe forests.\r\n\r\n"The appearance of large detached flocks of these birds in the air, and\r\nthe various evolutions they display, are strikingly picturesque and\r\ninteresting. In descending the Ohio by myself, I often rested on my oars\r\nto contemplate their aerial manoeuvres. A column of eight or ten miles\r\nin length would appear from Kentucky high in air, steering across to\r\nIndiana. The leaders of this great body would sometimes gradually vary\r\ntheir course, till it formed a large bend of more than a mile in\r\ndiameter, those behind tracing the exact route of their predecessors.\r\nThis would continue sometimes long after both extremities were beyond\r\nthe reach of sight; so that the whole with its glittering undulations\r\nmarked a space on the face of the heavens resembling the windings of a\r\nvast majestic river. When this bend became very great, the birds, as if\r\nsensible of the unnecessarily circuitous route they were taking,\r\nsuddenly changed their direction, so that what was in column before\r\nbecame an immense front, straightening all its indentures until it swept\r\nthe heavens in one vast and infinitely extended line. Other lesser\r\nbodies also united with each other as they happened to approach, and\r\nwith such ease and elegance of evolution, forming new figures and\r\nvarying these as they united or separated, that I was never tired of\r\ncontemplating them. Sometimes a hawk would sweep on a particular part of\r\nthe column from a great height, when almost as quick as lightning that\r\npart shot downwards out of the common track, but soon rising again,\r\ncontinued advancing at the same height as before. This inflection was\r\ncontinued by those behind, who, on arriving at this point, dived down\r\nalmost perpendicularly to a great depth, and, rising, followed the exact\r\npath of those that went before.\r\n\r\n"Happening to go ashore one charming afternoon to purchase some milk at\r\na house that stood near the river, and while talking with the people\r\nwithin doors, I was suddenly struck with astonishment at a loud rushing\r\nroar, succeeded by instant darkness, which for the first moment I took\r\nfor a tornado about to overwhelm the house, and every thing around, in\r\ndestruction. The people observing my surprise, coolly said, \'It is only\r\nthe pigeons,\' and on running out, I beheld a flock thirty or forty yards\r\nin width, sweeping along very low between the house and the mountain or\r\nheight that formed the second bank of the river. These continued\r\ncrossing for more than a quarter of an hour, and at length varied their\r\nbearing, so as to pass over the mountain, behind which they disappeared\r\nbefore the rear came up."\r\n\r\n"That is amazing, Uncle Thomas; two thousand millions of live birds! I\r\ncan scarcely form an adequate idea of such a mass of living creatures."\r\n\r\n"There is something almost overwhelming in the idea, Frank; and yet in\r\nsome parts of the world are to be found flocks of animals hardly less\r\nsurprisingly numerous, when we consider how much less they are fitted\r\nfor moving about, travelling at stated intervals from the mountains to\r\nthe sea coast, and returning again to their old habitations, after\r\nhaving fulfilled the purposes for which this instinctive feeling was\r\nimplanted in them."\r\n\r\n"Which animals do you mean, Uncle Thomas?"\r\n\r\n"I allude to the land-crab, which is a native of the Bahamas, and also\r\nof most of the other islands between the tropics. They live in clefts of\r\nthe rocks, or holes which they dig for themselves among the mountains,\r\nand subsist on vegetables. About the months of April and May, they\r\ndescend to the sea coast in a body of millions at a time, for the\r\npurpose of depositing their spawn. They march in a direct line towards\r\ntheir destination, and seldom turn out of their way, even should they\r\nencounter a wall or a house, but boldly attempt to scale it. If,\r\nhowever, they arrive at a river, they wind along the course of the\r\nstream, and thus reach the sea.\r\n\r\n"In their procession they are as regular as an army under the command of\r\nan experienced general, and are usually divided into three battalions.\r\nThe first body consists of the strongest males, which march forward to\r\nclear the route and face the greatest dangers. The main body is composed\r\nof females, which are formed into columns, sometimes extending fifty or\r\nsixty yards in breadth and three miles in depth. Three or four days\r\nafter these follows the third division or rear guard, a straggling\r\nundisciplined tribe, consisting both of males and females, but neither\r\nso robust nor so vigorous as the former.\r\n\r\n"Though easily drowned, a certain proportion of moisture seems necessary\r\nto the existence of these animals, and the advanced guard is often\r\nobliged to halt from the want of rain. The females, indeed, never leave\r\nthe mountains till the rainy season has fairly set in. They march\r\nchiefly during the night, but if it happens to rain during the day,\r\nthey always profit by it. When the sun is hot they halt till evening.\r\nThey march very slowly, and are sometimes three months in gaining the\r\nshore. When alarmed they run in a confused and disorderly manner,\r\nholding up and clattering their nippers with a threatening attitude, and\r\nif suffered to take hold of the hand they bite severely. If in their\r\njourney any of them should be so maimed as to be unable to proceed, the\r\nothers fall upon it and devour it.\r\n\r\n"Arrived at the coast, they prepare to cast their spawn. They go to the\r\nedge of the water, and suffer the waves to wash twice or thrice over\r\ntheir bodies, and then withdraw to seek a lodging upon the land. After a\r\nshort time the spawn becomes ready for being deposited, when they again\r\nseek the sea-side, and leave the spawn to be brought to maturity by the\r\nheat of the sun. Much of the spawn, which exactly resembles the roe of a\r\nherring, is devoured by the fishes; that which escapes soon arrives at\r\nmaturity, and millions of little crabs are then to be seen slowly\r\ntravelling towards the mountains.\r\n\r\n"The old ones in the mean time seek to return to their old haunts, but\r\nso feeble are they that they seem scarcely able to crawl along. Some of\r\nthem, indeed, are obliged to remain in the level parts of the country\r\ntill they recover, making holes in the earth, which they block up with\r\nleaves and dirt. In these they cast their old shells, after which they\r\nsoon recover, and become so fat as to be delicious food.\r\n\r\n"At the season of their descent from the mountains, the natives of the\r\nislands which they inhabit, eagerly wait for them and destroy them in\r\nthousands. On their descent they are only taken for the roe or spawn,\r\nthe flesh being then poor and lean: on their return from the sea-side\r\nthey are in greatest repute, being then fat and high flavoured.\r\n\r\n"The crab-catchers adopt various modes of securing them, but they are\r\nobliged to be very cautious, for when the animals perceive themselves\r\nattacked, they throw themselves on their back, and snap their claws\r\nabout, pinching whatever they lay hold of very severely. The\r\ncrab-catchers, however, soon learn to seize them by the hind legs, in\r\nsuch a manner as that the nippers cannot reach them."\r\n\r\n"You said, Uncle Thomas, that the fishes watched the descent of the\r\ncrabs, that they might feed on the spawn. Do you think that they are\r\nendowed with reasoning powers, as well as the higher classes of animals,\r\nUncle Thomas?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt of it, Frank. Old Isaac Walton, the most amusing author on\r\nangling who ever wrote, tells many curious stories about fishes, of\r\ntheir coming to be fed at the sound of a bell, and so forth.\r\n\r\n"Many fishes exhibit the migratory instinct quite as distinctly as those\r\nanimals which I have just told you about. The salmon leaves the sea, and\r\nseeks its way up the rivers, stemming their most rapid currents, and\r\nscaling highest waterfalls with a pertinacity which can only be the\r\nresult of an instinct implanted in them by their Creator."\r\n\r\n"And the herring, Uncle Thomas; does not it come every year from the\r\nPolar seas to spawn on our shores? I read a very interesting account of\r\ntheir progress southwards somewhere lately."\r\n\r\n"I can tell you where, Frank; I will show it you, and when you have read\r\nit aloud, I will point out one or two mistakes, which it is as well to\r\nclear your mind of. It is in old Pennant\'s work; here it is; will you\r\nread it to us, John?"\r\n\r\n"With pleasure, Uncle Thomas.\r\n\r\n"This mighty army begins to put itself in motion in the spring. They\r\nbegin to appear off the Shetland Islands in April and May. This is the\r\nfirst check this army meets in its march southward. There it is divided\r\ninto two parts; one wing of those destined to visit the Scottish coast\r\ntakes to the east, the other to the western shores of Great Britain, and\r\nfill every bay and creek with their numbers; others proceed towards\r\nYarmouth, the great and ancient mart of herrings; they then pass through\r\nthe British channel, and after that in a manner disappear. Those which\r\ntake to the west, after offering themselves to the Hebrides, where the\r\ngreat stationary fishery is, proceed towards the north of Ireland, where\r\nthey meet with a second interruption and are obliged to make a second\r\ndivision; the one takes to the western side and is scarcely perceived,\r\nbeing soon lost in the immensity of the Atlantic, but the other, which\r\npasses into the Irish sea, rejoins, and feeds the inhabitants of most of\r\nthe coasts that border on it. The brigades, as we call them, which are\r\nseparated from the greater columns, are often capricious in their\r\nmotions, and do not show an invariable attachment to their haunts."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, John. Now all this sounds very fine, and seems very\r\nsystematic. It has but one objection--it is quite untrue. It is in the\r\nfirst place more than doubtful if the herring frequents the Polar seas\r\nat all; and in the second place, the most distinguished naturalists are\r\nof opinion that it never leaves the neighbourhood of our own shores, but\r\nmerely retires to the deep water after it has spawned, and there remains\r\ntill the return of another season calls it again to the shores to\r\nundergo a similar operation. So you see, Frank, it does not follow that\r\nan interesting account of an animal\'s habits is necessarily a true\r\none."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     Uncle Thomas tells about the Baboons, and their Plundering\r\n     Excursions to the Gardens at the Cape of Good Hope, also about Le\r\n     Vaillant\'s Baboon, Kees, and his Peculiarities; the American\r\n     Monkeys; and relates an amusing Story about a young Monkey deprived\r\n     of its Mother, putting itself under the Fostering Care of a\r\n     Wig-Block.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Uncle Thomas, I saw such a strange looking creature to-day. It was\r\nso ugly. It seemed to be a very large monkey, it was as big as a boy."\r\n\r\n"I heard of it, Boys, though I did not see it. It was a baboon, and one\r\nof the largest of the species.--It was what is called the dog-faced\r\nbaboon."\r\n\r\n"Where do such animals come from, Uncle Thomas."\r\n\r\n"From Africa, John, and I believe they are not to be found elsewhere.\r\nThey are very fierce and mischievous creatures, and are said sometimes\r\neven to attack man, but this I believe to be an exaggeration. Immense\r\ntroops of them inhabit the mountains in the neighbourhood of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, whence they descend in bands to plunder the gardens and\r\norchards. In these excursions they move on a concerted plan, placing\r\nsentinels on commanding spots to give notice of the approach of an\r\nenemy. On the appearance of danger, the sentinel utters a loud yell,\r\nupon which the whole troop retreats with the utmost precipitation."\r\n\r\n"Do they carry the spoil with them when they are thus disturbed, Uncle\r\nThomas?"\r\n\r\n"When disturbed they are said to break in pieces the fruit which they\r\nhave gathered, and cram it into their cheek pouches--receptacles with\r\nwhich nature has furnished them for keeping articles of food till they\r\nare wanted.\r\n\r\n"Le Vaillant, a traveller in Africa, had a dog-faced baboon which\r\naccompanied him on his journey, and he found its instinct of great\r\nservice to him in various ways. As a sentinel he was better than any of\r\nthe dogs. So quick was his sense of danger, that he often gave notice of\r\nthe approach of beasts of prey, when every thing else seemed sunk in\r\nsecurity. He was also very useful in guarding the people of the\r\nexpedition from danger, from using unwholesome or poisonous fruits. The\r\nanimal\'s name was Kees. Here is the very interesting account which his\r\nmaster gives of him.\r\n\r\n"Whenever we found fruits or roots, with which my Hottentots were\r\nunacquainted, we did not touch them till Kees had tasted them. If he\r\nthrew them away, we concluded that they were either of a disagreeable\r\nflavour, or of a pernicious quality, and left them untasted. The ape\r\npossesses a peculiar property, wherein he differs greatly from other\r\nanimals, and resembles man,--namely, that he is by nature equally\r\ngluttonous and inquisitive. Without necessity, and without appetite, he\r\ntastes every thing that falls in his way, or that is given to him. But\r\nKees had a still more valuable quality,--he was an excellent sentinel;\r\nfor, whether by day or night, he immediately sprang up on the slightest\r\nappearance of danger. By his cry, and the symptoms of fear which he\r\nexhibited, we were always apprized of the approach of an enemy, even\r\nthough the dogs perceived nothing of it. The latter at length learned to\r\nrely upon him with such confidence, that they slept on in perfect\r\ntranquillity. I often took Kees with me when I went a hunting; and when\r\nhe saw me preparing for sport, he exhibited the most lively\r\ndemonstrations of joy. On the way he would climb into the trees, to look\r\nfor gum, of which he was very fond. Sometimes he discovered to me honey,\r\ndeposited in the clefts of rocks, or hollow trees. But if he happened to\r\nhave met with neither honey nor gum, and his appetite had become sharp\r\nby his running about, I always witnessed a very ludicrous scene. In\r\nthose cases, he looked for roots, which he ate with great greediness,\r\nespecially a particular kind, which, to his cost, I also found to be\r\nvery well tasted and refreshing, and therefore insisted upon sharing\r\nwith him. But Kees was no fool. As soon as he found such a root, and I\r\nwas not near enough to seize upon my share of it, he devoured it in the\r\ngreatest haste, keeping his eyes all the while riveted on me. He\r\naccurately measured the distance I had to pass before I could get to\r\nhim; and I was sure of coming too late. Sometimes, however, when he had\r\nmade a mistake in his calculation, and I came upon him sooner than he\r\nexpected, he endeavoured to hide the root, in which case I compelled\r\nhim, by a box on the ear, to give me up my share. But this treatment\r\ncaused no malice between us; we remained as good friends as ever. In\r\norder to draw these roots out of the ground, he employed a very\r\ningenious method, which afforded me much amusement. He laid hold of the\r\nherbage with his teeth, stemmed his fore feet against the ground, and\r\ndrew back his head, which gradually pulled out the root. But if this\r\nexpedient, for which he employed his whole strength, did not succeed, he\r\nlaid hold of the leaves as before, as close to the ground as possible,\r\nand then threw himself heels over head, which gave such a concussion to\r\nthe root, that it never failed to come out.\r\n\r\n"When Kees happened to tire on the road, he mounted upon the back of one\r\nof my dogs, who was so obliging as to carry him whole hours. One of\r\nthem, which was larger and stronger than the rest, hit upon a very\r\ningenious artifice, to avoid being pressed into this piece of service.\r\nAs soon as Kees leaped upon his back he stood still, and let the train\r\npass, without moving from the spot. Kees still persisted in his\r\nintention, till we were almost out of his sight, when he found himself\r\nat length compelled to dismount, upon which both the baboon and dog\r\nexerted all their speed to overtake us. The latter, however, gave him\r\nthe start, and kept a good look-out after him, that he might not serve\r\nhim in the same manner again. In fact, Kees enjoyed a certain authority\r\nwith all my dogs, for which he perhaps was indebted to the superiority\r\nof his instinct. He could not endure a competitor; if any of the dogs\r\ncame too near him when he was eating, he gave them a box on the ear,\r\nwhich compelled him immediately to retire to a respectful distance.\r\n\r\n"Serpents excepted, there were no animals of whom Kees stood in such\r\ngreat dread as of his own species,--perhaps owing to a consciousness,\r\nthat he had lost a portion of his natural capacities. Sometimes he heard\r\nthe cry of the other apes among the mountains, and, terrified as he was,\r\nhe yet answered them. But if they approached nearer, and he saw any of\r\nthem, he fled, with a hideous cry, crept between our legs, and trembled\r\nover his whole body. It was very difficult to compose him, and it\r\nrequired some time before he recovered from his fright.\r\n\r\n"Like all other domestic animals, Kees was addicted to stealing. He\r\nunderstood admirably well how to loose the strings of a basket, in order\r\nto take victuals out of it, especially milk, of which he was very fond.\r\nMy people chastised him for these thefts; but that did not make him\r\namend his conduct. I myself sometimes whipped him; but then he ran away,\r\nand did not return again to the tent, until it grew dark. Once as I was\r\nabout to dine, and had put the beans which I had boiled for myself upon\r\na plate, I heard the voice of a bird, with which I was not acquainted. I\r\nleft my dinner standing, seized my gun, and run out of my tent. After\r\nthe space of about a quarter of an hour, I returned, with the bird in my\r\nhand; but to my astonishment, found not a single bean upon the plate.\r\nKees had stolen them all, and taken himself out of the way. When he had\r\ncommitted any trespass of this kind, he used always, about the time when\r\nI drank tea, to return quietly, and seat himself in his usual place,\r\nwith every appearance of innocence, as if nothing had happened; but this\r\nevening he did not let himself be seen; and on the following day, also,\r\nhe was not seen by any of us; and in consequence, I began to grow\r\nseriously uneasy about him, and apprehensive that he might be lost for\r\never, but on the third day, one of my people, who had been to fetch\r\nwater, informed me that he had seen Kees in the neighbourhood; but that\r\nas soon as the animal espied him, he had concealed himself again. I\r\nimmediately went out and beat the whole neighbourhood with my dogs. All\r\nat once, I heard a cry, like that which Kees used to make when I\r\nreturned from my shooting, and had not taken him with me. I looked about\r\nand at length espied him, endeavouring to hide himself behind the large\r\nbranches of a tree. I now called to him in a friendly tone of voice, and\r\nmade motions to him to come down to me. But he would not trust me, and I\r\nwas obliged to climb up the tree to fetch him. He did not attempt to\r\nfly, and we returned together to my quarters; here he expected to\r\nreceive his punishment; but I did nothing, as it would have been of no\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n"When exhausted with the heat of the sun, and the fatigues of the day,\r\nwith my throat and mouth covered with dust and perspiration, I was ready\r\nto sink gasping to the ground, in tracts destitute of shade, and longed\r\neven for the dirtiest ditch-water; but after seeking long in vain, lost\r\nall hopes of finding any in the parched soil. In such distressing\r\nmoments, my faithful Kees never moved from my side. We sometimes got out\r\nof our carriage, and then his sure instinct led him to a plant.\r\nFrequently the stalk was fallen off, and then all his endeavours to pull\r\nit out were in vain. In such cases, he began to scratch in the earth\r\nwith his paws; but as that would also have proved ineffectual, I came to\r\nhis assistance with my dagger, or my knife, and we honestly divided the\r\nrefreshing root with each other.\r\n\r\n"An officer, wishing one day to put the fidelity of my baboon, Kees, to\r\nthe test, pretended to strike me. At this Kees flew in a violent rage,\r\nand, from that time, he could never endure the sight of the officer. If\r\nhe only saw him at a distance, he began to cry and make all kinds of\r\ngrimaces, which evidently showed that he wished to revenge the insult\r\nthat had been done to me; he ground his teeth, and endeavoured, with\r\nall his might, to fly at his face, but that was out of his power, as he\r\nwas chained down. The offender several times endeavoured, in vain, to\r\nconciliate him, by offering him dainties, but he remained long\r\nimplacable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOG AND BABOON--Page 185.]\r\n\r\n"When any eatables had been pilfered at my quarters, the fault was\r\nalways laid first upon Kees; and rarely was the accusation unfounded.\r\nFor a time the eggs which a hen laid me were constantly stolen away, and\r\nI wished to ascertain whether I had to attribute this loss also to him.\r\nFor this purpose, I went one morning to watch him, and waited till the\r\nhen announced by her cackling that she had laid an egg. Kees was sitting\r\nupon my vehicle; but the moment he heard the hen\'s voice he leapt down,\r\nand was running to fetch the egg. When he saw me he suddenly stopped,\r\nand affected a careless posture, swaying himself backwards upon his hind\r\nlegs, and assuming a very innocent look; in short, he employed all his\r\nart to deceive me with respect to his design. His hypocritical\r\nmanoeuvres only confirmed my suspicions, and, in order in my turn to\r\ndeceive him, I pretended not to attend to him, and turned my back to the\r\nbush where the hen was cackling, upon which he immediately sprang to the\r\nplace. I ran after him, and came up to him at the moment when he had\r\nbroken the egg, and was swallowing it. Having caught the thief in the\r\nfact, I gave him a good beating upon the spot; but this severe\r\nchastisement did not prevent his soon stealing fresh-laid eggs again. As\r\nI was convinced that I should never be able to break Kees of his natural\r\nvices, and that, unless I chained him up every morning, I should never\r\nget an egg, I endeavoured to accomplish my purpose in another manner: I\r\ntrained one of my dogs, as soon as the hen cackled, to run to the nest,\r\nand bring me the egg without breaking it. In a few days the dog had\r\nlearned his lesson; but Kees, as soon as he heard the hen cackle, ran\r\nwith him to the nest. A contest now took place between them, who should\r\nhave the egg; often the dog was foiled, although he was the stronger of\r\nthe two. If he gained the victory, he ran joyfully to me with the egg,\r\nand put it into my hand. Kees, nevertheless, followed him, and did not\r\ncease to grumble and make threatening grimaces at him, till he saw me\r\ntake the egg,--as if he was comforted for the loss of his booty by his\r\nadversary\'s not retaining it for himself. If Kees had got hold of the\r\negg, he endeavoured to run with it to a tree, where, having devoured it,\r\nhe threw down the shells upon his adversary, as if to make game of him.\r\nIn that case, the dog returned, looking ashamed, from which I could\r\nconjecture the unlucky adventure he had met with.\r\n\r\n"Kees was always the first awake in the morning, and when it was the\r\nproper time he awoke the dogs, who were accustomed to his voice, and, in\r\ngeneral, obeyed without hesitation the slightest motions by which he\r\ncommunicated his orders to them, immediately taking their posts about\r\nthe tent and carriage, as he directed them."\r\n\r\n"What a delightful companion Kees must have been, Uncle Thomas!"\r\n\r\n"He must at least have been an amusing one, Frank, and not an unuseful\r\none either. There are, however, great variations in this respect among\r\nthe monkeys; some of them are most lively creatures, seldom sitting\r\nstill for a couple of minutes, while others are retired and gloomy in\r\ntheir dispositions, and some are most fickle and uncertain. The fair\r\nmonkey, though one of the most beautiful of the tribe, is of the latter\r\ndescription, as the following story will testify:--\r\n\r\n"An animal of this class, which from its extreme beauty and gentleness\r\nwas allowed to ramble at liberty about a ship, soon became a great\r\nfavourite among the crew, and in order to make him perfectly happy, as\r\nthey imagined, they procured him a wife. For some weeks he was a devoted\r\nhusband, and showed her every attention and respect. He then grew cool,\r\nand became jealous of any kind of civility shown her by the master of\r\nthe vessel, and began to use her with much cruelty. His treatment made\r\nher wretched and dull; and she bore the spleen of her husband with that\r\nfortitude which is characteristic of the female sex of the human\r\nspecies. And pug, like the lords of the creation, was up to deceit, and\r\npractised pretended kindness to his spouse, to effect a diabolical\r\nscheme, which he seemed to premeditate. One morning, when the sea ran\r\nvery high, he seduced her aloft, and drew her attention to an object at\r\nsome distance from the yard-arm; her attention being fixed, he all of a\r\nsudden applied his paw to her rear, and canted her into the sea, where\r\nshe fell a victim to his cruelty. This seemed to afford him high\r\ngratification, for he descended in great spirits."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a wretched creature, Uncle Thomas. I wonder the sailors did\r\nnot throw him into the sea also."\r\n\r\n"Stay, Frank, you are somewhat too hasty. He deserved certainly to be\r\npunished; but I doubt whether it would have been proper to have put him\r\nto death for his misdeed. All monkeys are not, however, equally cruel;\r\nsome of them, indeed, are remarkable for the instinctive kindness which\r\nthey evince towards their young. When threatened by danger, they mount\r\nthem on their back, or clasp them firmly to their breast, to which the\r\nyoung creatures secure themselves, by means of their long and powerful\r\narms, so as to permit of their parent moving about, and springing from\r\nbranch to branch, with nearly as much facility as if she were perfectly\r\nfree from all incumbrance."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can readily believe that, Uncle Thomas. One day lately, at the\r\nZoological Gardens, I saw two monkeys clasping a young one between them,\r\nto keep it warm. They seemed so fond of it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Frank, I have also seen them occupied in the same way. I was quite\r\ndelighted at such an unexpected exhibition of tenderness.\r\n\r\n"Some of the monkeys which are natives of the American continent have\r\nthe singular characteristic of prehensile tales; that is, of tails which\r\nthey can more about, and lay hold of branches of trees with nearly as\r\nmuch ease as they can with their hands. The facilities which this\r\naffords them for moving about with celerity among the branches of trees\r\nis astonishing. The firmness of the grasp which it takes of the tree is\r\nno less surprising, for if it makes a single coil round a branch, it is\r\nquite sufficient, not only to support the weight of the animal, but to\r\nenable it to swing in such a manner as to gain a fresh hold with its\r\nfeet."\r\n\r\n"That is very curious, Uncle Thomas. Is there any other animal which has\r\nthis power in the tail."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Frank, several of the lizards have the power, as well as some\r\nother animals; the little harvest mouse, for instance; but none of them\r\nare possessed of it in so high a degree as the American monkeys.\r\n\r\n"I have now pretty well exhausted my stories about the monkey tribe. I\r\nrecollect only one more at present, and it occurred to the same\r\ntraveller to whom Kees belonged.\r\n\r\n"In one of his excursions he happened to kill a female monkey, which\r\ncarried a young one on her back. The little creature, as if insensible\r\nof its mother\'s death, continued to cling to the dead body till they\r\nreached their evening quarters; and even then it required considerable\r\nforce to disengage it. No sooner, however, did the little creature feel\r\nitself alone, than it darted towards a wooden block, on which was placed\r\nthe wig of Le Vaillant\'s father, mistaking it for its dead mother. To\r\nthis it clung most pertinaciously by its fore paws; and such was the\r\nforce of this deceptive instinct, that it remained in the same position\r\nfor about three weeks, all this time evidently mistaking the wig for its\r\nmother. It was fed, from time to time, with goat\'s milk; and, at length,\r\nemancipated itself voluntarily, by quitting the fostering care of the\r\nperuke. The confidence which it ere long assumed, and the amusing\r\nfamiliarity of its manners, soon rendered it a favourite. The\r\nunsuspecting naturalist had, however, introduced a wolf in sheep\'s\r\nclothing into his dwelling: for, one morning, on entering his chamber,\r\nthe door of which had been imprudently left open, he beheld his young\r\nfavourite making a hearty breakfast on a very noble collection of\r\ninsects. In the first transports of his anger, he resolved to strangle\r\nthe monkey in his arms: but his rage immediately gave way to pity, when\r\nhe perceived that the crime of its voracity had carried the punishment\r\nalong with it. In eating the beetles, it had swallowed several of the\r\npins on which they were transfixed. Its agony, consequently, became\r\ngreat; and all his efforts were unable to preserve its life."\r\n\r\n"Poor creature! How unfortunate, Uncle Thomas. It must, however, have\r\nbeen a very stupid animal to mistake a wig for its mother."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n     Uncle Thomas concludes Stories about Instinct with several\r\n     Interesting Illustrations of the Affections of Animals,\r\n     particularly of the Instinct of Maternal Affection, in the course\r\n     of which he narrates the Story of the Cat and the Black-Bird; the\r\n     Squirrel\'s Nest; the Equestrian Friends; and points out the\r\n     Beneficent Care of Providence in implanting in the Breasts of each\r\n     of his Creatures the Instinct which is necessary for its Security\r\n     and Protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Uncle Thomas? We were so delighted with the adventures of\r\nKees, that we wish to know if you have any more such amusing stories to\r\ntell us."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, Boys, plenty such, but it is now time to bring these STORIES\r\nABOUT INSTINCT to a close. I am therefore going to conclude by narrating\r\none or two stories about the affections of animals. I wish to impress\r\nyour minds with feelings of kindness towards them, and I think that the\r\nbest way to do so is to exhibit them to you in their gentleness and\r\nlove; to show you that they too partake of the kindlier emotions by\r\nwhich the heart of man is moved, and that the feelings of maternal\r\naffection, and of friendship, and of fidelity, are as much the\r\nprerogatives of the lower animals as they are of man himself. Perhaps\r\none of the most amiable lights in which the affections of animals are\r\nexhibited is their love and attachment to their offspring. You have all\r\nseen how regardless of danger a domestic hen, one of the most timid and\r\ndefenceless of animals, becomes when she has charge of a brood of\r\nchickens. At other times she is alarmed by the slightest noise--the\r\nsudden rustle of a leaf makes her shrink with fear and apprehension.\r\nYet, no sooner do her little helpless offspring escape from the shell,\r\nthan she becomes armed with a determination of which even birds of prey\r\nstand in awe."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, Uncle Thomas, I have often seen a hen attack a large dog and\r\ndrive it away from her chickens."\r\n\r\n"It marks the wisdom of the omnipotent and all-wise Creator, Boys, that\r\nhe has implanted in the hearts of each of his creatures the particular\r\ninstincts which were necessary for their safety and protection. Thus, in\r\nthe case I have just spoken of, the instinctive courage with which the\r\nmother is endowed, you will find to be the best security which could\r\nhave been devised. In some other birds this instinct exhibits itself in\r\na different way. If you happen to approach the nest of the lapwing, for\r\ninstance, the old birds try every means to attract your attention, and\r\nlure you away from the sacred spot. They will fly close by you, and in\r\nan irregular manner, as if wounded; but no sooner do they find that\r\ntheir stratagem has been successful, and that you have passed the nest\r\nunobserved, than they at once take a longer flight, and soon leave you\r\nbehind."\r\n\r\n"How very singular, Uncle Thomas! Does the lapwing defend its young with\r\nas much courage as the hen?"\r\n\r\n"I am not aware that it does, Frank, though I think it is not at all\r\nunlikely. As its instinct teaches it to finesse in the way which I have\r\ntold you, however, I should not expect to find that it does so with\r\nequal spirit. Even the pigeon, the very emblem of gentleness and love,\r\nboldly pecks at the rude hand which is extended towards its young,\r\nduring the earlier stages of their existence. If you come by chance on\r\nthe brood of a partridge, the mother flutters along, as if she were so\r\nmuch wounded that it was impossible to escape, and the young ones squat\r\nthemselves close by the earth. When by her cunning wiles she has led you\r\nto a little distance, and you discover that her illness was feigned, you\r\nreturn to the spot to seek for the young, and you find that they too are\r\ngone: no sooner is your back turned than they run and hide themselves in\r\nsome more secret place, where they remain till the well-known call of\r\nthe mother again collects them under her wing.\r\n\r\n"I lately heard a most interesting story of the boldness of a pair of\r\nblackbirds in defence of their young. A cat was one day observed mounted\r\non the top of a railing, endeavouring to get at a nest which was near\r\nit, containing a brood of young birds. On the cat\'s approach the mother\r\nleft the nest, and flew to meet it in a state of great alarm, placing\r\nherself almost within its reach, and uttering the most piteous screams\r\nof wildness and despair. Alarmed by his partner\'s screams, the male bird\r\nsoon discovered the cause of her distress, and in a state of equal\r\ntrepidation flew to the place, uttering loud screams and outcries,\r\nsometimes settling on the fence just before the cat, which was unable to\r\nmake a spring in consequence of the narrowness of its footing. After a\r\nlittle time, seeing that their distress made no impression on their\r\nassailant, the male bird flew at the cat, settled on its back, and\r\npecked at its head with so much violence that it fell to the ground,\r\nfollowed by the blackbird, which at length succeeded in driving it away.\r\nFoiled in this attempt, the cat a short time after again returned to\r\nthe charge, and was a second time vanquished, which so intimidated her\r\nthat she relinquished all attempts to get at the young birds. For\r\nseveral days, whenever she made her appearance in the garden, she was\r\nset upon by the blackbirds, and at length became so much afraid of them,\r\nthat she scampered to a place of security whenever she saw them\r\napproach."\r\n\r\n"That was very bold indeed, Uncle Thomas. Birds seem to be all very much\r\nattached to their young."\r\n\r\n"Very much so, Harry; but perhaps not more so than many quadrupeds. Here\r\nis a story of the squirrel\'s affection, which, though it does not\r\nexhibit an instance of active defence against its enemies, affords one\r\nof endurance equally admirable.\r\n\r\n"In cutting down some trees on the estate recently purchased by the\r\ncrown at Petersham, for the purpose of being annexed to Richmond park,\r\nthe axe was applied to the root of a tall tree, on the top of which was\r\na squirrel\'s nest. A rope was fastened to the tree for the purpose of\r\npulling it down more expeditiously; the workmen cut at the roots; the\r\nrope was pulled; the tree swayed backwards and forwards, and at length\r\nfell. During all these operations a female squirrel never attempted to\r\ndesert her new-born young, but remained with them in the nest. When the\r\ntree fell down, she was thrown out and secured unhurt, and was put into\r\na cage with her young ones. She suckled them for a short time, but\r\nrefused to eat. Her maternal affection, however, remained till the last\r\nmoment of her life, and she died in the act of affording all the\r\nnourishment in her power to her offspring.\r\n\r\n"We are too apt, Boys, to overlook the admirable lessons which such\r\nstories as these inculcate. They should teach us kindness to each\r\nother--kindness, indeed, not only to those of our own species, but\r\nkindness to all created creatures. If the lower animals love each other\r\nso warmly and affectionately, how much more ought man, to whom the\r\nCreator has been so beneficent, to love his fellow creatures. But though\r\nthe attachment of animals to their offspring is an admirable mode of its\r\ndevelopement, it is far from being the only one. After all the STORIES\r\nABOUT DOGS--their love of their master--their fidelity--their\r\nsagacity--which I will relate to you at a future time, it is hardly\r\nnecessary for me to bring forward evidence in favour of this position.\r\nHere is an instance of friendship, as it is called, between horses,\r\nwhich was so strong as to terminate fatally.\r\n\r\n"During the Peninsular war, two horses, which had long been associated\r\ntogether, assisting to drag the same piece of artillery, and standing\r\ntogether the shock of many battles, became so much attached to each\r\nother as to be inseparable companions. At length one of them was killed.\r\nAfter the battle in which this took place, the other was picquetted as\r\nusual, and his food brought to him. He refused, however, to eat, and was\r\nconstantly turning round his head to look for his companion, sometimes\r\nneighing as if to call her. All the attention which was bestowed upon\r\nhim was of no avail; though surrounded by horses he took no notice of\r\nthem, but incessantly bewailed his absent friend. He died shortly after,\r\nhaving refused to taste food from the time his former companion was\r\nkilled!\r\n\r\n"Such is but one solitary instance.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n'
