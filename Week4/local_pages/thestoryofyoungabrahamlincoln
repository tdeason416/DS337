The greatest President\'s son, Robert\r\nLincoln, discussing a certain incident in their life in the White House,\r\nremarked to the writer, with a smile full of meaning:\r\n\r\n"I believe you know more about our family matters than I do!"\r\n\r\nThis is because "all the world loves a lover"--and Abraham Lincoln loved\r\neverybody. With all his brain and brawn, his real greatness was in his\r\nheart. He has been called "the Great-Heart of the White House," and\r\nthere is little doubt that more people have heard about him than there\r\nare who have read of the original "Great-Heart" in "The Pilgrim\'s\r\nProgress."\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is safe to say that more millions in the modern world are\r\nacquainted with the story of the rise of Abraham Lincoln from a poorly\r\nbuilt log cabin to the highest place among "the seats of the mighty,"\r\nthan are familiar with the Bible story of Joseph who arose and stood\r\nnext to the throne of the Pharaohs.\r\n\r\nNearly every year, especially since the Lincoln Centennial, 1909,\r\nsomething new has been added to the universal knowledge of one of the\r\ngreatest, if not _the_ greatest man who ever lived his life in the\r\nworld. Not only those who "knew Lincoln," but many who only "saw him\r\nonce" or shook hands with him, have been called upon to tell what they\r\nsaw him do or heard him say. So hearty was his kindness toward everybody\r\nthat the most casual remark of his seems to be charged with deep human\r\naffection--"the touch of Nature" which has made "the whole world kin" to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe knew just how to sympathize with every one. The people felt this,\r\nwithout knowing why, and recognized it in every deed or word or touch,\r\nso that those who have once felt the grasp of his great warm hand seem\r\nto have been drawn into the strong circuit of "Lincoln fellowship," and\r\nwere enabled, as if by "the laying on of hands," to speak of him ever\r\nafter with a deep and tender feeling.\r\n\r\nThere are many such people who did not rush into print with their\r\nobservations and experiences. Their Lincoln memories seemed too sacred\r\nto scatter far and wide. Some of them have yielded, with real\r\nreluctance, in relating all for publication in THE STORY OF YOUNG\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN only because they wished their recollections to benefit\r\nthe rising generation.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these modest folk have shed true light on important phases\r\nand events in Lincoln\'s life history. For instance, there has been much\r\ndiscussion concerning Lincoln\'s Gettysburg Address--where was it\r\nwritten, and did he deliver it from notes?\r\n\r\nNow, fifty years after that great occasion, comes a distinguished\r\ncollege professor who unconsciously settles the whole dispute, whether\r\nLincoln held his notes in his right hand or his left--if he used them at\r\nall!--while making his immortal "little speech." To a group of veterans\r\nof the Grand Army of the Republic he related, casually, what he saw\r\nwhile a college student at Gettysburg, after working his way through the\r\ncrowd of fifteen thousand people to the front of the platform on that\r\nmemorable day. From this point of vantage he saw and heard everything,\r\nand there is no gainsaying the vivid memories of his first\r\nimpressions--how the President held the little pages in both hands\r\nstraight down before him, swinging his tall form to right, to left and\r\nto the front again as he emphasized the now familiar closing words,\r\n"_of_ the people--_by_ the people--_for_ the people--shall not perish\r\nfrom the earth."\r\n\r\nSuch data have been gathered from various sources and are here given for\r\nthe first time in a connected life-story. Several corrections of stories\r\ngiving rise to popular misconceptions have been supplied by Robert,\r\nLincoln\'s only living son. One of these is the true version of "Bob\'s"\r\nlosing the only copy of his father\'s first inaugural address. Others\r\nwere furnished by two aged Illinois friends who were acquainted with\r\n"Abe" before he became famous. One of these explained, without knowing\r\nit, a question which has puzzled several biographers--how a young man of\r\nLincoln\'s shrewd intelligence could have been guilty of such a\r\nmisdemeanor, as captain in the Black Hawk War, as to make it necessary\r\nfor his superior officer to deprive him of his sword for a single day.\r\n\r\nA new story is told by a dear old lady, who did not wish her name\r\ngiven, about herself when she was a little girl, when a "drove of\r\nlawyers riding the old Eighth Judicial District of Illinois," came to\r\ndrink from a famous cold spring on her father\'s premises. She described\r\nthe uncouth dress of a tall young man, asking her father who he was, and\r\nhe replied with a laugh, "Oh, that\'s Abe Lincoln."\r\n\r\nOne day in their rounds, as the lawyers came through the front gate, a\r\ncertain judge, whose name the narrator refused to divulge, knocked down\r\nwith his cane her pet doll, which was leaning against the fence. The\r\nlittle girl cried over this contemptuous treatment of her "child."\r\n\r\nYoung Lawyer Lincoln, seeing it all, sprang in and quickly picked up the\r\nfallen doll. Brushing off the dust with his great awkward hand he said,\r\nsoothingly, to the wounded little mother-heart:\r\n\r\n"There now, little Black Eyes, don\'t cry. Your baby\'s alive. See, she\r\nisn\'t hurt a bit!"\r\n\r\nThat tall young man never looked uncouth to her after that. It was this\r\nsame old lady who told the writer that Lawyer Lincoln wore a new suit of\r\nclothes for the first time on the very day that he performed the\r\noft-described feat of rescuing a helpless hog from a great deep hole in\r\nthe road, and plastered his new clothes with mud to the great merriment\r\nof his legal friends. This well-known incident occurred not far from her\r\nfather\'s place near Paris, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThese and many other new and corrected incidents are now collected for\r\nTHE STORY OF YOUNG ABRAHAM LINCOLN, in addition to the best of\r\neverything suitable that was known before--as the highest patriotic\r\nservice which the writer can render to the young people of the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\n                                                       WAYNE WHIPPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF\r\nYOUNG ABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN\'S FOREFATHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln\'s grandfather, for whom he was named Abraham, was a distant\r\ncousin to Daniel Boone. The Boones and the Lincolns had intermarried for\r\ngenerations. The Lincolns were of good old English stock. When he was\r\nPresident, Abraham Lincoln, who had never given much attention to the\r\nfamily pedigree, said that the history of his family was well described\r\nby a single line in Gray\'s "Elegy":\r\n\r\n"The short and simple annals of the poor."\r\n\r\nYet Grandfather Abraham was wealthy for his day. He accompanied Boone\r\nfrom Virginia to Kentucky and lost his life there. He had sacrificed\r\npart of his property to the pioneer spirit within him, and, with the\r\nkilling of their father, his family lost the rest. They were "land\r\npoor" in the wilderness of the "Dark-and-Bloody-Ground"--the meaning of\r\nthe Indian name, "Ken-tuc-kee."\r\n\r\nGrandfather Lincoln had built a solid log cabin and cleared a field or\r\ntwo around it, near the Falls of the Ohio, about where Louisville now\r\nstands. But, in the Summer of 1784, the tragic day dawned upon the\r\nLincolns which has come to many a pioneer family in Kentucky and\r\nelsewhere. His son Thomas told this story to his children:\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW INDIANS KILLED "GRANDFATHER LINCOLN"\r\n\r\n"My father--your grandfather, Abraham Lincoln--come over the mountains\r\nfrom Virginia with his cousin, Dan\'l Boone. He was rich for them times,\r\nas he had property worth seventeen thousand dollars; but Mr. Boone he\r\ntold Father he could make a good deal more by trappin\' and tradin\' with\r\nthe Injuns for valuable pelts, or fur skins.\r\n\r\n"You know, Dan\'l Boone he had lived among the Injuns. He was a sure shot\r\nwith the rifle so\'s he could beat the redskins at their own game. They\r\ntook him a prisoner oncet, and instead of killin\' him, they was about\r\nready to make him chief--he pretended all the while as how he\'d like\r\nthat--when he got away from \'em. He was such a good fellow that them\r\nInjuns admired his shrewdness, and they let him do about what he\r\npleased. So he thought they\'d let Father alone.\r\n\r\n"Well, your grandfather was a Quaker, you see, and believed in treatin\'\r\nthem red devils well--like William Penn done, you know. He was a man for\r\npeace and quiet, and everything was goin\' smooth with the tribes of what\r\nwe called the Beargrass Country, till one day, when he and my brothers,\r\nMordecai--\'Mord\' was a big fellow for his age--and Josiah, a few years\r\nyounger--was out in the clearin\' with the oxen, haulin\' logs down to the\r\ncrick. I went along too, but I didn\'t help much--for I was only six.\r\n\r\n"Young as I was, I remember what happened that day like it was only\r\nyesterday. It come like a bolt out of the blue. We see Father drop like\r\nhe was shot--for he _was_ shot! Then I heard the crack of a rifle and I\r\nsaw a puff of smoke floatin\' out o\' the bushes.\r\n\r\n"Injuns!" gasps Mord, and starts on the run for the house--to get his\r\ngun. Josiah, he starts right off in the opposite direction to the\r\nBeargrass fort--we called it a fort, but it was nothin\' but a stockade.\r\nThe way we boys scattered was like a brood o\' young turkeys, or\r\npa\'tridges, strikin\' for cover when the old one is shot. I knowed I\'d\r\nought to run too, but I didn\'t want to leave my father layin\' there on\r\nthe ground. Seemed like I\'d ought to woke him up so he could run too.\r\nYet I didn\'t feel like touchin\' him. I think I must \'a\' knowed he was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n"While I was standin\' still, starin\' like the oxen, not knowin\' what to\r\ndo, a big Injun come out o\' the brush, with a big knife in his hand. I\r\nknowed what he was goin\' to do--skelp my father! I braced up to \'im to\r\nkeep \'im away, an\' he jist laffed at me. I never think what the devil\r\nlooks like without seein\' that red demon with his snaky black eyes,\r\ngrinnin\' at me!\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM LINCOLN CHASED BY INDIANS\r\n\r\n"He picked me up like I was a baby an set me on the sawlog, an\' was\r\nturnin\' back to skelp Father, when--biff!--another gun-crack--and Mr.\r\nBig Indian he drops jist like your grandfather did, only he wriggles and\r\nsquirms around, bitin\' the dust--like a big snake for all the world!\r\n\r\n"I was standin\' there, kind o\' dazed, watchin\' another puff o\' white\r\nsmoke, comin\' out between two logs in the side of our house. Then I\r\nknowed \'Mord\' had shot my Injun. He had run in, got the gun down off\'n\r\nthe wall, an\' peekin\' out through a crack, he sees that Injun takin\'\r\nhold o\' me. Waitin\' till the ol\' demon turns away, so\'s not to hit me,\r\n\'Mord\' he aims at a silver dangler on Mr. Injun\'s breast and makes him\r\ndrop in his tracks like I said. Your Uncle \'Mord\' he was a sure\r\nshot--like Cousin Dan\'l Boone.\r\n\r\n"Then I hears the most blood-curdlin\' yells, and a lot o\' red devils\r\njump out o\' the bushes an\' come for me brandishin\' their tomahawks an\'\r\nskelpin\' knives. It was like hell broke loose. They had been watchin\'\r\nan\', of course, \'twas all right to kill Father, but when \'Mord\' killed\r\none o\' their bucks, that made a big difference. I had sense enough left\r\nto run for the house with them Injuns after me. Seemed like I couldn\'t\r\nrun half as fast as usual, but I must \'a\' made purty good time, from\r\nwhat \'Mord\' an\' Mother said afterward.\r\n\r\n"He said one was ahead o\' the rest an\' had his tomahawk raised to brain\r\nme with it when--bing!--an\' \'Mord\' fetches _him_ down like he did the\r\nfellow that was goin\' to skelp Father. That made the others mad an\' they\r\ntook after me, but \'Mord\' he drops the head one jist when he\'s goin\' to\r\nhit me. But all I knowed at the time was that them red devils was\r\na-chasin\' me, and I\'d got to \'leg it\' for dear life!\r\n\r\n"When I gits near enough to the house, I hears Mother and \'Mord\'\r\nhollerin\' to make me run faster and go to the door, for Mother had it\r\nopen jist wide enough to reach out an\' snatch me in--when the third\r\nInjun was stoopin\' to grab me, but \'Mord\' makes him bite the dust like\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n"My, but wasn\'t them Injuns mad! Some of \'em sneaked around behind the\r\nhouse--they had to give \'Mord\'s\' gun a wide berth to git there!--but he\r\ncould only protect the front--and was a-settin\' fire to our cabin to\r\nsmoke us out or roast us alive, jist when the soldiers come with Josiah\r\nfrom the fort and saved our lives. Then the Injuns made \'emselves\r\nscurce--but they druv off the oxen and all our other stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n"MORD" LINCOLN, INDIAN FIGHTER\r\n\r\n"That was the breaking up of our family. None of us boys was old enough\r\nto take Father\'s place, an\' Mother she was afraid to live there alone.\r\nAccordin\' to the laws o\' Virginia--Kentucky belonged to Virginia\r\nthen--the oldest son got all the proputty, so \'Mord\' he gets it all. He\r\nwas welcome to it too, for he was the only one of us that could take\r\ncare of it. \'Mord\' he wasn\'t satisfied with killin\' a few Injuns that\r\nday to revenge Father\'s death. He made a business of shootin\' \'em on\r\nsight--a reg\'lar Injun stalker! He couldn\'t see that he was jist as\r\nsavage as the worst Injun, to murder \'em without waitin\' to see whether\r\nMr. Injun was a friend or a foe.\r\n\r\n"Oncet when I told \'im there was good an\' bad red men like they wuz good\r\nan\' bad white men, he said I might jist as well say \'good _devil_\' as\r\n\'good Injun!\' He says \'the only good Injun\'s the dead Injun!\'\r\n\r\n"Well, the settlers must \'a\' \'greed with \'Mord,\' for they made him\r\nsheriff o\' the county--he was sech a good shot, too--an\' they \'lected\r\nhim to the Legislatur\' after Kentucky come in as a State. He stood high\r\nin the county. Folks didn\'t mind his shootin\' an\' Injun or two, more or\r\nless, when he got the chancet. They all looked on redskins like they\r\nwas catamounts an\' other pesky varmints.\r\n\r\n"Your grandmother Lincoln an\' Josiah an\' me moved over into Washington\r\nCounty, but she had hard scrabblin\' to git a livin\'. Josiah he stayed\r\nwith her, an\' between him an\' \'Mord,\' they helped her along, but I had\r\nto git out and scratch for a livin\'. From the time I was ten I was hired\r\nout to work for my \'keep,\' an\' anything else I could git. I knocked\r\naroun\' the country, doin\' this, that an\' t\'other thing till I picked up\r\ncarpenterin\' o\' Joseph Hanks, a cousin o\' mine, an\' there I met his\r\nsister Nancy, an\' that\'s how she come to be your mother--an\' \'bout how I\r\ncome to be your father, too!"\r\n\r\nLittle is known today of Mordecai Lincoln, and there would be less\r\ninterest in poor Thomas if he had not become the father of Abraham\r\nLincoln, the sixteenth President of the United States. Mordecai Lincoln\r\nwas a joker and humorist. One who knew him well said of him:\r\n\r\n"He was a man of great drollery, and it would almost make you laugh to\r\nlook at him. I never saw but one other man whose quiet, droll look\r\nexcited in me the disposition to laugh, and that was \'Artemus Ward.\'\r\n\r\n"Mordecai was quite a story-teller, and in this Abe resembled his \'Uncle\r\nMord,\' as we called him. He was an honest man, as tender-hearted as a\r\nwoman, and to the last degree charitable and benevolent.\r\n\r\n"Abe Lincoln had a very high opinion of his uncle, and on one occasion\r\nremarked, \'I have often said that Uncle Mord had run off with all the\r\ntalents of the family.\'"\r\n\r\nIn a letter about his family history, just before he was nominated for\r\nthe presidency, Abraham Lincoln wrote:\r\n\r\n"My parents were both born in Virginia, of undistinguished\r\nfamilies--second families, perhaps I should say. My mother was of a\r\nfamily of the name of Hanks. My paternal grandfather, Abraham Lincoln,\r\nemigrated from Rockingham County, Virginia, to Kentucky about 1781 or 2,\r\nwhere, a year or two later, he was killed by Indians--not in battle, but\r\nby stealth, when he was laboring to open a farm in the forest. His\r\nancestors, who were Quakers, went to Virginia from Berks County,\r\nPennsylvania. An effort to identify them with the New England family of\r\nthe same name ended in nothing more definite than a similarity of\r\nChristian names in both families, such as Enoch, Levi, Mordecai,\r\nSolomon, Abraham, and the like.\r\n\r\n"My father, at the death of his father, was but six years of age; and he\r\ngrew up, literally without education."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN\'S FATHER AND MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Thomas Lincoln was living with a farmer and doing odd jobs of\r\ncarpentering, he met Nancy Hanks, a tall, slender woman, with dark skin,\r\ndark brown hair and small, deep-set gray eyes. She had a full forehead,\r\na sharp, angular face and a sad expression. Yet her disposition was\r\ngenerally cheerful. For her backwoods advantages she was considered well\r\neducated. She read well and could write, too. It is stated that Nancy\r\nHanks taught Thomas Lincoln to write his own name. Thomas was\r\ntwenty-eight and Nancy twenty-three when their wedding day came.\r\nChristopher Columbus Graham, when almost one hundred years old, gave\r\nthe following description of the marriage feast of the Lincoln bride\r\nand groom:\r\n\r\n"I am one of the two living men who can prove that Abraham Lincoln, or\r\nLinkhorn, as the family was miscalled, was born in lawful wedlock, for I\r\nsaw Thomas Lincoln marry Nancy Hanks on the 12th day of June, 1806. I\r\nwas hunting roots for my medicine and just went to the wedding to get a\r\ngood supper and got it.\r\n\r\n"Tom Lincoln was a carpenter, and a good one for those days, when a\r\ncabin was built mainly with the ax, and not a nail or a bolt or hinge in\r\nit, only leathers and pins to the doors, and no glass, except in watches\r\nand spectacles and bottles. Tom had the best set of tools in what was\r\nthen and is now Washington County.\r\n\r\n"Jesse Head, the good Methodist minister that married them, was also a\r\ncarpenter or cabinet maker by trade, and as he was then a neighbor, they\r\nwere good friends.\r\n\r\n"While you pin me down to facts, I will say that I saw Nancy Hanks\r\nLincoln at her wedding, a fresh-looking girl, I should say over twenty.\r\nTom was a respectable mechanic and could choose, and she was treated\r\nwith respect.\r\n\r\n"I was at the infare, too, given by John H. Parrott, her guardian, and\r\nonly girls with money had guardians appointed by the court. We had bear\r\nmeat; venison; wild turkey and ducks\' eggs, wild and tame--so common\r\nthat you could buy them at two bits a bushel; maple sugar, swung on a\r\nstring, to bite off for coffee; syrup in big gourds, peach and honey; a\r\nsheep that the two families barbecued whole over coals of wood burned in\r\na pit, and covered with green boughs to keep the juices in. Our table\r\nwas of the puncheons cut from solid logs, and the next day they were the\r\nfloor of the new cabin."\r\n\r\nThomas Lincoln took his bride to live in a little log cabin in a\r\nKentucky settlement--not a village or hardly a hamlet--called\r\nElizabethtown. He evidently thought this place would be less lonesome\r\nfor his wife, while he was away hunting and carpentering, than the\r\nlonely farm he had purchased in Hardin County, about fourteen miles\r\naway. There was so little carpentering or cabinet making to do that he\r\ncould make a better living by farming or hunting. Thomas was very fond\r\nof shooting and as he was a fine marksman he could provide game for the\r\ntable, and other things which are considered luxuries to-day, such as\r\nfurs and skins needed for the primitive wearing apparel of the\r\npioneers. A daughter was born to the young couple at Elizabethtown, whom\r\nthey named Sarah.\r\n\r\nDennis Hanks, a cousin of Nancy, lived near the Lincolns in the early\r\ndays of their married life, and gave Mrs. Eleanor Atkinson this\r\ndescription of their early life together:\r\n\r\n"Looks didn\'t count them days, nohow. It was stren\'th an\' work an\'\r\ndaredevil. A lazy man or a coward was jist pizen, an\' a spindlin\' feller\r\nhad to stay in the settlemints. The clearin\'s hadn\'t no use fur him. Tom\r\nwas strong, an\' he wasn\'t lazy nor afeer\'d o\' nothin\', but he was kind\r\no\' shif\'less--couldn\'t git nothin\' ahead, an\' didn\'t keer putickalar.\r\nLots o\' them kind o\' fellers in \'arly days, \'druther hunt and fish, an\'\r\nI reckon they had their use. They killed off the varmints an\' made it\r\nsafe fur other fellers to go into the woods with an ax.\r\n\r\n"When Nancy married Tom he was workin\' in a carpenter shop. It wasn\'t\r\nTom\'s fault he couldn\'t make a livin\' by his trade. Thar was sca\'cely\r\nany money in that kentry. Every man had to do his own tinkerin\', an\'\r\nkeep everlastin\'ly at work to git enough to eat. So Tom tuk up some\r\nland. It was mighty ornery land, but it was the best Tom could git,\r\nwhen he hadn\'t much to trade fur it.\r\n\r\n"Pore? We was all pore, them days, but the Lincolns was porer than\r\nanybody. Choppin\' trees an\' grubbin\' roots an\' splittin\' rails an\'\r\nhuntin\' an\' trappin\' didn\'t leave Tom no time. It was all he could do to\r\ngit his fambly enough to eat and to kiver \'em. Nancy was turrible\r\nashamed o\' the way they lived, but she knowed Tom was doin\' his best,\r\nan\' she wa\'n\'t the pesterin\' kind. She was purty as a pictur\' an\' smart\r\nas you\'d find \'em anywhere. She could read an\' write. The Hankses was\r\nsome smarter\'n the Lincolns. Tom thought a heap o\' Nancy, an\' he was as\r\ngood to her as he knowed how. He didn\'t drink or swear or play cyards or\r\nfight, an\' them was drinkin\', cussin\', quarrelsome days. Tom was\r\npopylar, an\' he could lick a bully if he had to. He jist couldn\'t git\r\nahead, somehow."\r\n\r\n\r\n"NANCY\'S BOY BABY"\r\n\r\nEvidently Elizabethtown failed to furnish Thomas Lincoln a living wage\r\nfrom carpentering, for he moved with his young wife and his baby girl to\r\na farm on Nolen Creek, fourteen miles away. The chief attraction of the\r\nso-called farm was a fine spring of water bubbling up in the shade of a\r\nsmall grove. From this spring the place came to be known as "Rock Spring\r\nFarm." It was a barren spot and the cabin on it was a rude and primitive\r\nsort of home for a carpenter and joiner to occupy. It contained but a\r\nsingle room, with only one window and one door. There was a wide\r\nfireplace in the big chimney which was built outside. But that rude hut\r\nbecame the home of "the greatest American."\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln was born to poverty and privation, but he was never a\r\npauper. His hardships were those of many other pioneers, the wealthiest\r\nof whom suffered greater privations than the poorest laboring man has to\r\nendure to-day.\r\n\r\nAfter his nomination to the presidency, Mr. Lincoln gave to Mr. Hicks, a\r\nportrait painter, this memorandum of his birth:\r\n\r\n        "I was born February 12, 1809, in then Hardin\r\n        County, Kentucky, at a point within the now\r\n        county of Larue, a mile or a mile and a half\r\n        from where Hodgen\'s mill now is. My parents\r\n        being dead, and my memory not serving, I know\r\n        no means of identifying the precise locality.\r\n        It was on Nolen Creek.\r\n\r\n                                                "A. LINCOLN.\r\n        "JUNE 14, 1860."\r\n\r\nThe exact spot was identified after his death, and the house was found\r\nstanding many years later. The logs were removed to Chicago, for the\r\nWorld\'s Columbian Exposition, in 1893, and the cabin was reconstructed\r\nand exhibited there and elsewhere in the United States. The materials\r\nwere taken back to their original site, and a fine marble structure now\r\nencloses the precious relics of the birthplace of "the first American,"\r\nas Lowell calls Lincoln in his great "Commemoration Ode."\r\n\r\nCousin Dennis Hanks gives the following quaint description of "Nancy\'s\r\nboy baby," as reported by Mrs. Eleanor Atkinson in her little book on\r\n"Lincoln\'s Boyhood."\r\n\r\n"Tom an\' Nancy lived on a farm about two miles from us, when Abe was\r\nborn. I ricollect Tom comin\' over to our house one cold mornin\' in\r\nFeb\'uary an\' sayin\' kind o\' slow, \'Nancy\'s got a boy baby.\'\r\n\r\n"Mother got flustered an\' hurried up \'er work to go over to look after\r\nthe little feller, but I didn\'t have nothin\' to wait fur, so I cut an\'\r\nrun the hull two mile to see my new cousin.\r\n\r\n"You bet I was tickled to death. Babies wasn\'t as common as blackberries\r\nin the woods o\' Kaintucky. Mother come over an\' washed him an\' put a\r\nyaller flannel petticoat on him, an\' cooked some dried berries with wild\r\nhoney fur Nancy, an\' slicked things up an\' went home. An\' that\'s all the\r\nnuss\'n either of \'em got.\r\n\r\n"I rolled up in a b\'ar skin an\' slep\' by the fireplace that night, so\'s\r\nI could see the little feller when he cried an\' Tom had to get up an\'\r\ntend to him. Nancy let me hold him purty soon. Folks often ask me if Abe\r\nwas a good lookin\' baby. Well, now, he looked just like any other baby,\r\nat fust--like red cherry pulp squeezed dry. An\' he didn\'t improve none\r\nas he growed older. Abe never was much fur looks. I ricollect how Tom\r\njoked about Abe\'s long legs when he was toddlin\' round the cabin. He\r\ngrowed out o\' his clothes faster\'n Nancy could make \'em.\r\n\r\n"But he was mighty good comp\'ny, solemn as a papoose, but interested in\r\neverything. An\' he always did have fits o\' cuttin\' up. I\'ve seen him\r\nwhen he was a little feller, settin\' on a stool, starin\' at a visitor.\r\nAll of a sudden he\'d bu\'st out laughin\' fit to kill. If he told us what\r\nhe was laughin\' at, half the time we couldn\'t see no joke.\r\n\r\n"Abe never give Nancy no trouble after he could walk excep\' to keep him\r\nin clothes. Most o\' the time he went bar\'foot. Ever wear a wet buckskin\r\nglove? Them moccasins wasn\'t no putection ag\'inst the wet. Birch bark\r\nwith hickory bark soles, strapped on over yarn socks, beat buckskin all\r\nholler, fur snow. Abe\'n me got purty handy contrivin\' things that way.\r\nAn\' Abe was right out in the woods about as soon\'s he was weaned,\r\nfishin\' in the creek, settin\' traps fur rabbits an\' muskrats, goin\' on\r\ncoon-hunts with Tom an\' me an\' the dogs, follerin\' up bees to find\r\nbee-trees, an\' drappin\' corn fur his pappy. Mighty interestin\' life fur\r\na boy, but thar was a good many chances he wouldn\'t live to grow up."\r\n\r\nWhen little Abe was four years old his father and mother moved from Rock\r\nSpring Farm to a better place on Knob Creek, a few miles to the\r\nnortheast of the farm where he was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE BOY LINCOLN\'S BEST TEACHER\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Knob Creek the boy began to go to an "A B C" school. His first\r\nteacher was Zachariah Riney. Of course, there were no regular schools in\r\nthe backwoods then. When a man who "knew enough" happened to come along,\r\nespecially if he had nothing else to do, he tried to teach the children\r\nof the pioneers in a poor log schoolhouse. It is not likely that little\r\nAbe went to school more than a few weeks at this time, for he never had\r\na year\'s schooling in his life. There was another teacher afterward at\r\nKnob Creek--a man named Caleb Hazel. Little is known of either of these\r\nteachers except that he taught little Abe Lincoln. If their pupil had\r\nnot become famous the men and their schools would never have been\r\nmentioned in history.\r\n\r\nAn old man, named Austin Gollaher, used to like to tell of the days when\r\nhe and little Abe went to school together. He said:\r\n\r\n"Abe was an unusually bright boy at school, and made splendid progress\r\nin his studies. Indeed, he learned faster than any of his schoolmates.\r\nThough so young, he studied very hard."\r\n\r\nAlthough Nancy Lincoln insisted on sending the children to school, when\r\nthere was any, she had a large share in Abe\'s early education, just as\r\nshe had taught his father to write his own name. She told them Bible\r\nstories and such others as she had picked up in her barren, backwoods\r\nlife. She and her husband were too religious to believe in telling their\r\nchildren fairy tales.\r\n\r\nThe best thing of all was the reading of "The Pilgrim\'s Progress" during\r\nthe long Winter evenings, after the wood was brought in and Father Tom\r\nhad set his traps and done his other work for the night. Nancy\'s voice\r\nwas low, with soft, southern tones and accents. Tom and the children\r\nenjoyed the story of Christian\'s pilgrimage from the City of Destruction\r\nto the Celestial City the more because of her love for the story she was\r\nreading to them, as they lay on bearskin rugs before the blazing fire.\r\n\r\nAbe was only six, but he was a thoughtful boy. He tried to think of some\r\nway to show his gratitude to his mother for giving them so much\r\npleasure. While out gathering sticks and cutting wood for the big\r\nfireplace, a happy thought came to him--he would cut off some spicewood\r\nbranches, hack them up on a log, and secrete them behind the cabin.\r\nThen, when the mother was ready to read again, and Sarah and the father\r\nwere sitting and lying before the fire, he brought in the hidden\r\nbranches and threw them on, a few twigs at a time, to the surprise of\r\nthe others. It worked like a charm; the spicewood boughs not only added\r\nto the brightness of the scene but filled the whole house with the\r\n"sweet smelling savour" of a little boy\'s love and gratitude.\r\n\r\nNo one can fathom the pleasure of that precious memory throughout those\r\nfour lives, as the story of Great Heart and Christiana followed\r\nChristian along the path that "shineth more and more unto the perfect\r\nday." While the father and sister were delighted with the crackle,\r\nsparkle and pleasant aroma of the bits of spicewood, as Abe tossed them\r\nupon the fire, no one could appreciate the thoughtful act of the boy so\r\nmuch as his mother. It would be strange if her eyes did not fill, as she\r\nread to her fascinated family, but that was not the sort of thing the\r\nfondest mother could speak of.\r\n\r\nLittle did Nancy dream that, in reading to her son of the devotion of\r\nGreat Heart to his charges, she was fostering a spirit in her little son\r\nthat would help him make the noble pilgrimage from their hovel to the\r\nhighest home in the land, where another President of the United States\r\nwould refer to him as "the Great Heart of the White House." If any one\r\ncould have looked ahead fifty years to see all this, and could have told\r\nNancy Hanks Lincoln, she would not have believed it. After her own life\r\nof toil and hardship it would have seemed to her "too good to be true."\r\nBut in the centuries following the humble yet beautiful career of "the\r\nBackwoods Boy" from the hut to the White House, history keeps the whole\r\nworld saying with bated breath, "the half was never told!"\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD MAN\'S STORY OF SAVING ABRAHAM LINCOLN\'S LIFE\r\n\r\nAustin Gollaher, grown to manhood, still living in his old log cabin\r\nnear the Lincoln house in Knob Creek nearly twenty years after\r\nLincoln\'s assassination, and gave the following account of an adventure\r\nhe had with the little Lincoln boy:\r\n\r\n"I once saved Lincoln\'s life. We had been going to school together one\r\nyear; but the next year we had no school, because there were so few\r\nscholars to attend, there being only about twenty in the school the year\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"Consequently Abe and I had not much to do; but, as we did not go to\r\nschool and our mothers were strict with us, we did not get to see each\r\nother very often. One Sunday morning my mother waked me up early, saying\r\nshe was going to see Mrs. Lincoln, and that I could go along. Glad of\r\nthe chance, I was soon dressed and ready to go. After my mother and I\r\ngot there, Abe and I played all through the day.\r\n\r\n"While we were wandering up and down the little stream called Knob\r\nCreek, Abe said: \'Right up there\'--pointing to the east--\'we saw a covey\r\nof partridges yesterday. Let\'s go over.\' The stream was too wide for us\r\nto jump across. Finally we saw a foot-log, and decided to try it. It was\r\nnarrow, but Abe said, \'Let\'s coon it.\'\r\n\r\n"I went first and reached the other side all right. Abe went about half\r\nway across, when he got scared and began trembling. I hollered to him,\r\n\'Don\'t look down nor up nor sideways, but look right at me and hold on\r\ntight!\' But he fell off into the creek, and, as the water was about\r\nseven or eight feet deep (I could not swim, and neither could Abe), I\r\nknew it would do no good for me to go in after him.\r\n\r\n"So I got a stick--a long water sprout--and held it out to him. He came\r\nup, grabbing with both hands, and I put the stick into his hands. He\r\nclung to it, and I pulled him out on the bank, almost dead. I got him by\r\nthe arms and shook him well, and then I rolled him on the ground, when\r\nthe water poured out of his mouth.\r\n\r\n"He was all right very soon. We promised each other that we would never\r\ntell anybody about it, and never did for years. I never told any one of\r\nit till after Lincoln was killed."\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln\'s parents were religious in their simple way. The boy\r\nwas brought up to believe in the care of the Father in Heaven over the\r\naffairs of this life. The family attended camp meetings and preaching\r\nservices, which were great events, because few and far between, in those\r\nprimitive days. Abe used afterward to get his playmates together and\r\npreach to them in a way that sometimes frightened them and made them\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nNo doubt young Lincoln learned more that was useful to him in after life\r\nfrom the wandering preachers of his day than he did of his teachers\r\nduring the few months that he was permitted to go to school. But his\r\nbest teacher was his mother. She would have been proud to have her boy\r\ngrow up to be a traveling minister or exhorter, like Peter Cartwright,\r\n"the backwoods preacher."\r\n\r\nNancy Hanks Lincoln "builded better than she knew." She would have been\r\nsatisfied with a cabin life for her son. She little knew that by her own\r\nlife and teaching she was raising up the greatest man of his age, and\r\none of the grandest men in all history, to become the ruler of the\r\ngreatest nation that the world has ever seen. She did her duty by her\r\nlittle boy and he honored her always during her life and afterward. No\r\nwonder he once exclaimed when he thought of her:\r\n\r\n"All I am or hope to be I owe to my sainted mother."\r\n\r\nAnd out of her poor, humble life, that devoted woman\r\n\r\n"Gave us Lincoln and never knew!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nLEARNING TO WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little Lincoln boy learned to help his father and mother as soon as\r\nhe could, picking berries, dropping seeds and carrying water for the men\r\nto drink. The farm at Knob Creek seems to have been a little more\r\nfertile than the other two places on which his father had chosen to\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nOnce while living in the White House, President Lincoln was asked if he\r\ncould remember his "old Kentucky home." He replied with considerable\r\nfeeling:\r\n\r\n"I remember that old home very well. Our farm was composed of three\r\nfields. It lay in the valley, surrounded by high hills and deep gorges.\r\nSometimes, when there came a big rain in the hills, the water would come\r\ndown through the gorges and spread all over the farm. The last thing I\r\nremember of doing there was one Saturday afternoon; the other boys\r\nplanted the corn in what we called the big field--it contained seven\r\nacres--and I dropped the pumpkin seed. I dropped two seeds in every\r\nother row and every other hill. The next Sunday morning there came a big\r\nrain in the hills--it did not rain a drop in the valley, but the water,\r\ncoming through the gorges, washed the ground, corn, pumpkin seeds and\r\nall, clear off the field!"\r\n\r\nAlthough this was the last thing Lincoln could remember doing on that\r\nfarm, it is not at all likely that it was the last thing he did there,\r\nfor Thomas Lincoln was not the man to plant corn in a field he was about\r\nto leave. (The Lincolns moved away in the fall.)\r\n\r\nAnother baby boy was born at Knob Creek farm; a puny, pathetic little\r\nstranger. When this baby was about three years old, the father had to\r\nuse his skill as a cabinet maker in making a tiny coffin, and the\r\nLincoln family wept over a lonely little grave in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Abe began to learn lessons in practical patriotism. Once\r\nwhen Mr. Lincoln was asked what he could remember of the War of 1812, he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n"Nothing but this: I had been fishing one day and caught a little fish\r\nwhich I was taking home. I met a soldier on the road, and, having been\r\ntold at home that we must be good to the soldiers, I gave him my fish."\r\n\r\nAn old man, Major Alexander Sympson, who lived not far from the Lincolns\r\nat this period, left this description of "a mere spindle of a boy," in\r\none of his earliest attempts to defend himself against odds, while\r\nwaiting at the neighboring mill while a grist was being ground.\r\n\r\n"He was the shyest, most reticent, most uncouth and awkward-appearing,\r\nhomeliest and worst-dressed of any in the crowd. So superlatively\r\nwretched a butt could not hope to look on long unmolested. He was\r\nattacked one day as he stood near a tree by a larger boy with others at\r\nhis back. But the crowd was greatly astonished when little Lincoln\r\nsoundly thrashed the first, the second, and third boy in succession; and\r\nthen, placing his back against the tree, he defied the whole crowd, and\r\ntold them they were a lot of cowards."\r\n\r\nEvidently Father Tom, who enjoyed quite a reputation as a wrestler, had\r\ngive the small boy a few lessons in "the manly art of self-defense."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the little brother and sister were learning still better\r\nthings at their mother\'s knee, alternately hearing and reading stories\r\nfrom the Bible, "The Pilgrim\'s Progress," "\xc3\x86sop\'s Fables," "Robinson\r\nCrusoe," and other books, common now, but rare enough in the backwoods\r\nin those days.\r\n\r\nThere were hard times, even in the wilderness of Kentucky, after the War\r\nof 1812. Slavery was spreading, and Thomas and Nancy Lincoln heartily\r\nhated that "relic of barbarism." To avoid witnessing its wrongs which\r\nmade it harder for self-respecting white men to rise above the class\r\nreferred to with contempt in the South as "poor white trash," Tom\r\nLincoln determined to move farther north and west--and deeper into the\r\nwilds.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes stated that Abraham Lincoln belonged to the indolent\r\nclass known as "poor whites," but this is not true. Shiftless and\r\nimprovident though his father was, he had no use for that class of white\r\nslaves, who seemed to fall even lower than the blacks.\r\n\r\nThere was trouble, too, about the title to much of the land in Kentucky,\r\nwhile Indiana offered special inducements to settlers in that new\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nIn his carpenter work, Thomas Lincoln had learned how to build a\r\nflatboat, and had made at least one trip to New Orleans on a craft\r\nwhich he himself had put together. So, when he finally decided in the\r\nfall of 1816 to emigrate to Indiana, he at once began to build another\r\nboat, which he launched on the Rolling Fork, at the mouth of Knob Creek,\r\nabout half a mile from his own cabin. He traded his farm for what\r\nmovable property he could get, and loaded his raft with that and his\r\ncarpenter tools. Waving good-bye to his wife and two children, he\r\nfloated down the Rolling Fork, Salt River, and out into the Ohio River,\r\nwhich proved too rough for his shaky craft, and it soon went to pieces.\r\n\r\nAfter fishing up the carpenter tools and most of his other effects, he\r\nput together a crazy raft which held till he landed at Thompson\'s Ferry,\r\nPerry County, in Southern Indiana. Here he unloaded his raft, left his\r\nvaluables in the care of a settler named Posey and journeyed on foot\r\nthrough the woods to find a good location. After trudging about sixteen\r\nmiles, blazing a trail, he found a situation which suited him well\r\nenough, he thought. Then he walked all the way back to the Kentucky home\r\nthey were about to leave.\r\n\r\nHe found his wife, with Sarah, aged nine, and Abraham, aged seven, ready\r\nto migrate with him to a newer wilderness. The last thing Nancy Lincoln\r\nhad done before leaving their old home was to take the brother and\r\nsister for a farewell visit to the grave of "the little boy that died."\r\n\r\n\r\nOVER IN INDIANA\r\n\r\nThe place the father had selected for their home was a beautiful spot.\r\nThey could build their cabin on a little hill, sloping gently down on\r\nall sides. The soil was excellent, but there was one serious\r\ndrawback--there was no water fit to drink within a mile! Thomas Lincoln\r\nhad neglected to observe this most important point while he was\r\nprospecting. His wife, or even little Abe, would have had more common\r\nsense. That was one reason why Thomas Lincoln, though a good man, who\r\ntried hard enough at times, was always poor and looked down upon by his\r\nthrifty neighbors.\r\n\r\nInstead of taking his wife and children down the three streams by boat,\r\nas he had gone, the father borrowed two horses of a neighbor and "packed\r\nthrough to Posey\'s," where he had left his carpenter tools and the other\r\nproperty he had saved from the wreck of his raft. Abe and Sarah must\r\nhave enjoyed the journey, especially camping out every night on the\r\nway. The father\'s skill as a marksman furnished them with tempting\r\nsuppers and breakfasts of wild game.\r\n\r\nOn the horses they packed their bedding and the cooking utensils they\r\nneeded while on the journey, and for use after their arrival at the new\r\nhome. This stock was not large, for it consisted only of "one oven and\r\nlid, one skillet and lid, and some tinware."\r\n\r\nAfter they came to Posey\'s, Thomas Lincoln hired a wagon and loaded it\r\nwith the effects he had left there, as well as the bedding and the\r\ncooking things they had brought with them on the two horses. It was a\r\nrough wagon ride, jolting over stumps, logs, and roots of trees. An\r\nearlier settler had cut out a path for a few miles, but the rest of the\r\nway required many days, for the father had to cut down trees to make a\r\nrough road wide enough for the wagon to pass. It is not likely that Abe\r\nand Sarah minded the delays, for children generally enjoy new\r\nexperiences of that sort. As for their mother, she was accustomed to all\r\nsuch hardships; she had learned to take life as it came and make the\r\nbest of it.\r\n\r\nNancy Lincoln needed all her Christian fortitude in that Indiana\r\nhome--if such a place could be called a home. At last they reached the\r\nchosen place, in the "fork" made by Little Pigeon Creek emptying into\r\nBig Pigeon Creek, about a mile and a half from a settlement which was\r\nafterward called Gentryville.\r\n\r\nAs it was late in the fall, Thomas Lincoln decided not to wait to cut\r\ndown big trees and hew logs for a cabin, so he built a "half-faced\r\ncamp," or shed enclosed on three sides, for his family to live in that\r\nwinter. As this shed was made of saplings and poles, he put an ax in\r\nAbe\'s hands, and the seven-year-old boy helped his father build their\r\nfirst "home" in Indiana. It was Abe\'s first experience in the work that\r\nafterward made him famous as "the rail splitter." It was with the ax, as\r\nit were, that he hewed his way to the White House and became President\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nOf course, little Abe Lincoln had no idea of the White House then. He\r\nmay never have heard of "the President\'s Palace," as it used to be\r\ncalled--for the White House was then a gruesome, blackened ruin, burned\r\nby the British in the War of 1812. President Madison was living in a\r\nrented house nearby, while the Executive Mansion was being restored.\r\nThe blackened stone walls, left standing after the fire, were _painted\r\nwhite_, and on that account the President\'s mansion came to be known as\r\n"the White House."\r\n\r\nLittle Abe, without a thought of his great future, was getting ready for\r\nit by hacking away at poles and little trees and helping his father in\r\nthe very best way he knew. It was not long, then, before the "half-faced\r\ncamp" was ready for his mother and sister to move into.\r\n\r\nThen there was the water question. Dennis Hanks afterward said: "Tom\r\nLincoln riddled his land like a honeycomb" trying to find good water. In\r\nthe fall and winter they caught rainwater or melted snow and strained\r\nit, but that was not very healthful at best. So Abe and Sarah had to go\r\na mile to a spring and carry all the water they needed to drink, and,\r\nwhen there had been no rain for a long time, all the water they used for\r\ncooking and washing had to be brought from there, too.\r\n\r\nWhen warmer weather came, after their "long and dreary winter" of\r\nshivering in that poor shed, the "camp" did not seem so bad. Thomas\r\nLincoln soon set about building a warmer and more substantial cabin. Abe\r\nwas now eight years old, and had had some practice in the use of the\r\nax, so he was able to help his father still more by cutting and hewing\r\nlarger logs for the new cabin. They got it ready for the family to move\r\ninto before cold weather set in again.\r\n\r\nThey had to make their own furniture also. The table and chairs were\r\nmade of "puncheon," or slabs of wood, with holes bored under each corner\r\nto stick the legs in. Their bedsteads were poles fitted into holes bored\r\nin logs in the walls of the cabin, and the protruding ends supported by\r\npoles or stakes driven into the ground, for Tom Lincoln had not yet laid\r\nthe puncheon floor of their cabin. Abe\'s bed was a pile of dry leaves\r\nlaid in one corner of the loft to which he climbed by means of a ladder\r\nof pegs driven into the wall, instead of stairs.\r\n\r\nTheir surroundings were such as to delight the heart of a couple of\r\ncare-free children. The forest was filled with oaks, beeches, walnuts\r\nand sugar-maple trees, growing close together and free from underbrush.\r\nNow and then there was an open glade called a prairie or "lick," where\r\nthe wild animals came to drink and disport themselves. Game was\r\nplentiful--deer, bears, pheasants, wild turkeys, ducks and birds of all\r\nkinds. This, with Tom Lincoln\'s passion for hunting, promised good\r\nthings for the family to eat, as well as bearskin rugs for the bare\r\nearth floor, and deerskin curtains for the still open door and window.\r\nThere were fish in the streams and wild fruits and nuts of many kinds to\r\nbe found in the woods during the summer and fall. For a long time the\r\ncorn for the "corndodgers" which they baked in the ashes, had to be\r\nground by pounding, or in primitive hand-mills. Potatoes were about the\r\nonly vegetable raised in large quantities, and pioneer families often\r\nmade the whole meal of roasted potatoes. Once when his father had "asked\r\nthe blessing" over an ashy heap of this staple, Abe remarked that they\r\nwere "mighty poor blessings!"\r\n\r\nBut there were few complaints. They were all accustomed to that way of\r\nliving, and they enjoyed the free and easy life of the forest. Their\r\nonly reason for complaint was because they had been compelled to live in\r\nan open shed all winter, and because there was no floor to cover the\r\ndamp ground in their new cabin--no oiled paper for their one window, and\r\nno door swinging in the single doorway--yet the father was carpenter and\r\ncabinet maker! There is no record that Nancy Lincoln, weak and ailing\r\nthough she was, demurred even at such needless privations.\r\n\r\nAbout the only reference to this period of their life that has been\r\npreserved for us was in an odd little sketch in which Mr. Lincoln wrote\r\nof himself as "he."\r\n\r\n"A few days before the completion of his eighth year, in the absence of\r\nhis father, a flock of wild turkeys approached the new log cabin, and\r\nAbraham, with a rifle gun, standing inside, shot through a crack and\r\nkilled one of them. He has never since pulled a trigger on any larger\r\ngame."\r\n\r\nThough shooting was the principal sport of the youth and their fathers\r\nin Lincoln\'s younger days, Abe was too kind to inflict needless\r\nsuffering upon any of God\'s creatures. He had real religion in his\r\nloving heart. Even as a boy he seemed to know that\r\n\r\n        "He prayeth best who loveth best\r\n           All things both great and small;\r\n         For the dear God that loveth us,\r\n          He made and loveth all."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLOSING HIS MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1817, when the Lincoln family had moved from the shed\r\ninto the rough log cabin, Thomas and Betsy Sparrow came and occupied the\r\n"darned little half-faced camp," as Dennis Hanks called it. Betsy\r\nSparrow was the aunt who had brought up Nancy Hanks, and she was now a\r\nfoster-mother to Dennis, her nephew. Dennis became the constant\r\ncompanion of the two Lincoln children. He has told most of the stories\r\nthat are known of this sad time in the Lincoln boy\'s life.\r\n\r\nThe two families had lived there for nearly a year when Thomas and Betsy\r\nSparrow were both seized with a terrible disease known to the settlers\r\nas the "milk-sick" because it attacked the cattle. The stricken uncle\r\nand aunt died, early in October, within a few days of each other. While\r\nhis wife was ill with the same dread disease, Thomas Lincoln was at\r\nwork, cutting down trees and ripping boards out of the logs with a long\r\nwhipsaw with a handle at each end, which little Abe had to help him use.\r\nIt was a sorrowful task for the young lad, for Abe must have known that\r\nhe would soon be helping his father make his mother\'s coffin. They\r\nburied the Sparrows under the trees "without benefit of clergy," for\r\nministers came seldom to that remote region.\r\n\r\nNancy Lincoln did not long survive the devoted aunt and uncle. She had\r\nsuffered too much from exposure and privation to recover her strength\r\nwhen she was seized by the strange malady. One who was near her during\r\nher last illness wrote, long afterward:\r\n\r\n"She struggled on, day by day, like the patient Christian woman she was.\r\nAbe and his sister Sarah waited on their mother, and did the little jobs\r\nand errands required of them. There was no physician nearer than\r\nthirty-five miles.\r\n\r\n"The mother knew that she was going to die, and called the children to\r\nher bedside. She was very weak and the boy and girl leaned over her\r\nwhile she gave them her dying message. Placing her feeble hand on little\r\nAbe\'s head, she told him to be kind and good to his father and sister.\r\n\r\n"\'Be good to one another,\' she said to them both. While expressing her\r\nhope that they might live, as she had taught them to live, in the love\r\nof their kindred and the service of God, Nancy Hanks Lincoln passed from\r\nthe miserable surroundings of her poor life on earth to the brightness\r\nof the Beyond, on the seventh day after she was taken sick."\r\n\r\nTo the motherless boy the thought of his blessed mother being buried\r\nwithout any religious service whatever added a keen pang to the\r\nbitterness of his lot. Dennis Hanks once told how eagerly Abe learned to\r\nwrite:\r\n\r\n"Sometimes he would write with a piece of charcoal, or the p\'int of a\r\nburnt stick, on the fence or floor. We got a little paper at the country\r\ntown, and I made ink out of blackberry juice, briar root and a little\r\ncopperas in it. It was black, but the copperas would eat the paper after\r\na while. I made his first pen out of a turkey-buzzard feather. We hadn\'t\r\nno geese them days--to make good pens of goose quills."\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was able Abe Lincoln wrote his first letter. It was\r\naddressed to Parson Elkin, the Baptist preacher, who had sometimes\r\nstayed over night with the family when they lived in Kentucky, to ask\r\nthat elder to come and preach a sermon over his mother\'s grave. It had\r\nbeen a long struggle to learn to write "good enough for a\r\npreacher"--especially for a small boy who is asking such a favor of a\r\nman as "high and mighty" as a minister of the Gospel seemed to him.\r\n\r\nIt was a heartbroken plea, but the lad did not realize it. It was a\r\nshort, straightforward note, but the good preacher\'s eyes filled with\r\ntears as he read it.\r\n\r\nThe great undertaking was not finished when the letter was written. The\r\npostage was a large matter for a little boy. It cost sixpence (equal to\r\ntwelve-and-a-half cents today) to send a letter a short distance--up to\r\nthirty miles. Some letters required twenty-five cents--equal to fifty in\r\nmodern money. Sometimes, when the sender could not advance the postage,\r\nthe receiver had to pay it before the letter could be opened and read.\r\nOn this account letters were almost as rare and as expensive as\r\ntelegrams are today. When the person getting a letter could not pay the\r\npostage, it was returned to the writer, who had to pay double to get it\r\nback.\r\n\r\nIn those days one person could annoy another and put him to expense by\r\nwriting him and forcing him to pay the postage--then when the letter\r\nwas opened, it was found to be full of abuse, thus making a man pay for\r\ninsults to himself!\r\n\r\nThere was a great general who had suffered in this way, so he made a\r\nrule that he would receive no letters unless the postage was prepaid.\r\nOne day there came to his address a long envelope containing what seemed\r\nto be an important document. But it was not stamped, and the servant had\r\nbeen instructed not to receive that kind of mail. So it was returned to\r\nthe sender. When it came back it was discovered that it had been mailed\r\nby mistake without a stamp. That letter announced to General Zachary\r\nTaylor that he had been nominated by a great convention as candidate for\r\nPresident of the United States!\r\n\r\nAll this seems very strange now that a letter can be sent around the\r\nworld for a few cents. Besides, the mails did not go often and were\r\ncarried on horseback. For a long time one half-sick old man carried the\r\nmail on a good-for-nothing horse, once a week, between New York and\r\nPhiladelphia, though they were the largest cities in the country.\r\n\r\nSo it was many months before Abe received an answer to his letter.\r\nElder Elkin may have been away from home on one of the long circuits\r\ncovered by pioneer preachers. As the days and weeks went by without the\r\nlad\'s receiving any reply he was filled with misgivings lest he had\r\nimposed upon the good man\'s former friendship.\r\n\r\nAt last the answer came and poor Abe\'s anxiety was turned to joy. The\r\nkind elder not only said he would come, but he also named the Sunday\r\nwhen it would be, so that the Lincoln family could invite all their\r\nfriends from far and near to the postponed service--for it often\r\nhappened in this new country that the funeral could not take place for\r\nmonths after the burial.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the following Summer, nearly a year after Nancy\'s death,\r\nthat the devoted minister came. The word had gone out to all the region\r\nround about. It was the religious event of the season. Hundreds of\r\npeople of all ages came from twenty miles around on horseback--a father,\r\nmother and two children on one horse--also in oxcarts, and on foot. They\r\nsat in groups in the wagons, and on the green grass, as at the feeding\r\nof the multitudes in the time of the Christ. But these people brought\r\ntheir own refreshments as if it were a picnic.\r\n\r\nThey talked together in low, solemn tones while waiting for the poor\r\nlittle funeral procession to march out from the Lincoln cabin to the\r\ngrass-covered grave. Pioneer etiquette required the formalities of a\r\nfuneral. Elder Elkin was followed by the widowed husband, with Abraham\r\nand Sarah and poor Cousin Dennis, also bereaved of his foster-parents,\r\nand now a member of the Lincoln family.\r\n\r\nThere were tender hearts behind those hardened faces, and tears\r\nglistened on the tanned cheeks of many in that motley assemblage of\r\neager listeners, while the good elder was paying the last tribute of\r\nearth to the sweet and patient memory of his departed friend of other\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe words of the man of God, telling that assembled multitude what a\r\nlovely and devoted girl and woman his mother had been, gave sweet and\r\nsolemn joy to the soul of the little Lincoln boy. It was all for her\r\ndear sake, and she was, of all women, worthy of this sacred respect. As\r\nhe gazed around on the weeping people, he thought of the hopes and fears\r\nof the months that had passed since he wrote his first letter to bring\r\nthis about.\r\n\r\n"God bless my angel mother!" burst from his lonely lips--"how glad I am\r\nI\'ve learned to write!"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF ANOTHER MOTHER\r\n\r\nAll that a young girl of twelve could do, assisted by a willing brother\r\nof ten, was done by Sarah and Abraham Lincoln to make that desolate\r\ncabin a home for their lonesome father, and for cousin Dennis Hanks,\r\nwhose young life had been twice darkened by a double bereavement. But\r\n"what is home without a mother?" Thomas Lincoln, missing the balance and\r\ninspiration of a patient wife, became more and more restless, and, after\r\na year, wandered back again to his former homes and haunts in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nWhile visiting Elizabethtown he saw a former sweetheart, the Sally Bush\r\nof younger days, now Mrs. Daniel Johnston, widow of the county jailer\r\nwho had recently died, leaving three children and considerable property,\r\nfor that time and place. Thomas renewed his suit and won the pitying\r\nheart of Sarah Johnston, and according to the story of the county clerk:\r\n\r\n"The next morning, December 2, 1819, I issued the license, and the same\r\nday they were married, bundled up, and started for home."\r\n\r\nImagine the glad surprise of the three children who had been left at\r\nhome for weeks, when they saw a smart, covered wagon, drawn by four\r\nhorses, driven up before the cabin door one bright winter day, and their\r\nfather, active and alert, spring out and assist a pleasant-looking woman\r\nand three children to alight! Then they were told that this woman was to\r\nbe their mother and they had two more sisters and another brother!\r\n\r\nTo the poor forlorn Lincoln children and their still more desolate\r\ncousin, it seemed too good to be true. They quickly learned the names of\r\ntheir new brother and sisters. The Johnston children were called John,\r\nSarah and Matilda, so Sarah Lincoln\'s name was promptly changed to Nancy\r\nfor her dead mother, as there were two Sarahs already in the combined\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sarah Bush Johnston Lincoln lost no time in taking poor Abe and\r\nNancy Lincoln to her great motherly heart, as if they were her own. They\r\nwere dirty, for they had been neglected, ill-used and deserted. She\r\nwashed their wasted bodies clean and dressed them in nice warm clothing\r\nprovided for her own children, till she, as she expressed it, "made\r\nthem look more human."\r\n\r\nDennis Hanks told afterward of the great difference the stepmother made\r\nin their young lives:\r\n\r\n"In fact, in a few weeks all had changed; and where everything had been\r\nwanting, all was snug and comfortable. She was a woman of great energy,\r\nof remarkable good sense, very industrious and saving, also very neat\r\nand tidy in her person and manners. She took an especial liking for\r\nyoung Abe. Her love for him was warmly returned, and continued to the\r\nday of his death. But few children love their parents as he loved his\r\nstepmother. She dressed him up in entire new clothes, and from that time\r\non he appeared to lead a new life. He was encouraged by her to study,\r\nand a wish on his part was gratified when it could be done. The two sets\r\nof children got along finely together, as if they all had been the\r\nchildren of the same parents."\r\n\r\nDennis also referred to the "large supply of household goods" the new\r\nmother brought with her:\r\n\r\n"One fine bureau (worth $40), one table, one set of chairs, one large\r\nclothes chest, cooking utensils, knives, forks, bedding and other\r\narticles."\r\n\r\nIt must have been a glorious day when such a splendid array of household\r\nfurniture was carried into the rude cabin of Thomas Lincoln. But best of\r\nall, the new wife had sufficient tact and force of will to induce her\r\ngood-hearted but shiftless husband to lay a floor, put in a window, and\r\nhang a door to protect his doubled family from the cold. It was about\r\nChristmas time, and the Lincoln children, as they nestled in warm beds\r\nfor the first time in their lives, must have thanked their second mother\r\nfrom the bottoms of their grateful hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSCHOOL DAYS NOW AND THEN\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln once wrote, in a letter to a friend, about his early teachers in\r\nIndiana:\r\n\r\n"He (father) removed from Kentucky to what is now Spencer County,\r\nIndiana, in my eighth year. We reached our new home about the time the\r\nState came into the Union. It was a wild region with many bears and\r\nother wild animals still in the woods. There I grew up. There were some\r\nschools, so-called; but no qualification was ever required of a teacher\r\nbeside readin\', writin\', and cipherin\' to the Rule of Three (simple\r\nproportion). If a straggler supposed to understand Latin happened to\r\nsojourn in the neighborhood, he was looked upon as a wizard. There was\r\nabsolutely nothing to excite ambition for education."\r\n\r\nAbe\'s first teacher in Indiana, however, was Hazel Dorsey. The school\r\nhouse was built of rough, round logs. The chimney was made of poles well\r\ncovered with clay. The windows were spaces cut in the logs, and covered\r\nwith greased paper. But Abe was determined to learn. He and his sister\r\nthought nothing of walking four miles a day through snow, rain and mud.\r\n"Nat" Grigsby, who afterward married the sister, spoke in glowing terms\r\nof Abe\'s few school days:\r\n\r\n"He was always at school early, and attended to his studies. He lost no\r\ntime at home, and when not at work was at his books. He kept up his\r\nstudies on Sunday, and carried his books with him to work, so that he\r\nmight read when he rested from labor."\r\n\r\nThomas Lincoln had no use for "eddication," as he called it. "It will\r\nspile the boy," he kept saying. He--the father--had got along better\r\nwithout going to school, and why should Abe have a better education than\r\nhis father? He thought Abe\'s studious habits were due to "pure laziness,\r\njest to git shet o\' workin\'." So, whenever there was the slightest\r\nexcuse, he took Abe out of school and set him to work at home or for one\r\nof the neighbors, while he himself went hunting or loafed about the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThis must have been very trying to a boy as hungry to learn as Abe\r\nLincoln was. His new mother saw and sympathized with him, and in her\r\nquiet way, managed to get the boy started to school, for a few weeks at\r\nmost. For some reason Hazel Dorsey stopped "keeping" the school, and\r\nthere was a long "vacation" for all the children. But a new man, Andrew\r\nCrawford, came and settled near Gentryville. Having nothing better to do\r\nat first, he was urged to reopen the school.\r\n\r\nOne evening Abe came in from his work and his stepmother greeted him\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n"Another chance for you to go to school."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"That man Crawford that moved in a while ago is to begin school next\r\nweek, and two miles and back every day will be just about enough for you\r\nto walk to keep your legs limber."\r\n\r\nThe tactful wife accomplished it somehow and Abe started off to school\r\nwith Nancy, and a light heart. A neighbor described him as he appeared\r\nin Crawford\'s school, as "long, wiry and strong, while his big feet and\r\nhands, and the length of his legs and arms, were out of all proportion\r\nto his small trunk and head. His complexion was swarthy, and his skin\r\nshriveled and yellow even then. He wore low shoes, buckskin breeches,\r\nlinsey-woolsey shirt, and a coonskin cap. The breeches hung close to his\r\nlegs, but were far from meeting the tops of his shoes, exposing \'twelve\r\ninches of shinbone, sharp, blue and narrow.\'"\r\n\r\n"Yet," said Nat Grigsby, "he was always in good health, never sick, and\r\nhad an excellent constitution."\r\n\r\n\r\nHELPING KATE ROBY SPELL\r\n\r\nAndrew Crawford must have been an unusual man, for he tried to teach\r\n"manners" in his backwoods school! Spelling was considered a great\r\naccomplishment. Abe shone as a speller in school and at the\r\nspelling-matches. One day, evidently during a period when young Lincoln\r\nwas kept from school to do some outside work for his father, he appeared\r\nat the window when the class in spelling was on the floor. The word\r\n"defied" was given out and several pupils had misspelled it. Kate Roby,\r\nthe pretty girl of the village, was stammering over it. "D-e-f," said\r\nKate, then she hesitated over the next letter. Abe pointed to his eye\r\nand winked significantly. The girl took the hint and went on glibly\r\n"i-e-d," and "went up head."\r\n\r\n\r\n"I DID IT!"\r\n\r\nThere was a buck\'s head nailed over the school house door. It proved a\r\ntemptation to young Lincoln, who was tall enough to reach it easily. One\r\nday the schoolmaster discovered that one horn was broken and he demanded\r\nto know who had done the damage. There was silence and a general denial\r\ntill Abe spoke up sturdily:\r\n\r\n"I did it. I did not mean to do it, but I hung on it--and it broke!"\r\nThe other boys thought Abe was foolish to "own up" till he had to--but\r\nthat was his way.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if Abe Lincoln owned an arithmetic. He had a copybook,\r\nmade by himself, in which he entered tables of weights and measures and\r\n"sums" he had to do. Among these was a specimen of schoolboy doggerel:\r\n\r\n        "Abraham Lincoln,\r\n           His hand and pen,\r\n         He will be good--\r\n           But God knows when!"\r\n\r\nIn another place he wrote some solemn reflections on the value of time:\r\n\r\n        "Time, what an empty vapor \'tis,\r\n           And days, how swift they are!\r\n         Swift as an Indian arrow--\r\n           Fly on like a shooting star.\r\n         The present moment, just, is here,\r\n           Then slides away in haste,\r\n         That we can never say they\'re ours,\r\n           But only say they\'re past."\r\n\r\nAs he grew older his handwriting improved and he was often asked to "set\r\ncopies" for other boys to follow. In the book of a boy named\r\nRichardson, he wrote this prophetic couplet:\r\n\r\n        "Good boys who to their books apply\r\n         Will all be great men by and by."\r\n\r\n\r\nA "MOTHER\'S BOY"--HIS FOOD AND CLOTHING\r\n\r\nDennis Hanks related of his young companion: "As far as food and\r\nclothing were concerned, the boy had plenty--such as it\r\nwas--\'corndodgers,\' bacon and game, some fish and wild fruits. We had\r\nvery little wheat flour. The nearest mill was eighteen miles. A hoss\r\nmill it was, with a plug (old horse) pullin\' a beam around; and Abe used\r\nto say his dog could stand and eat the flour as fast as it was made,\r\n_and then be ready for supper_!\r\n\r\n"For clothing he had jeans. He was grown before he wore all-wool pants.\r\nIt was a new country, and he was a raw boy, rather a bright and likely\r\nlad; but the big world seemed far ahead of him. We were all slow-goin\'\r\nfolks. But he had the stuff of greatness in him. He got his rare sense\r\nand sterling principles from both parents. But Abe\'s kindliness, humor,\r\nlove of humanity, hatred of slavery, all came from his mother. I am\r\nfree to say Abe was a \'mother\'s boy.\'"\r\n\r\nDennis used to like to tell of Abe\'s earliest ventures in the fields of\r\nliterature: "His first readin\' book was Webster\'s speller. Then he got\r\nhold of a book--I can\'t rickilect the name. It told about a feller, a\r\nnigger or suthin\', that sailed a flatboat up to a rock, and the rock was\r\nmagnetized and drawed the nails out of his boat, an\' he got a duckin\',\r\nor drownded, or suthin\', I forget now. (This book, of course, was \'The\r\nArabian Nights.\') Abe would lay on the floor with a chair under his\r\nhead, and laugh over them stories by the hour. I told him they was\r\nlikely lies from end to end; but he learned to read right well in them."\r\n\r\nHis stock of books was small, but they were the right kind--the Bible,\r\n"The Pilgrim\'s Progress," \xc3\x86sop\'s Fables, "Robinson Crusoe," a history of\r\nthe United States, and the Statutes of Indiana. This last was a strange\r\nbook for a boy to read, but Abe pored over it as eagerly as a lad to-day\r\nmight read "The Three Guardsmen," or "The Hound of the Baskervilles." He\r\nmade notes of what he read with his turkey-buzzard pen and brier-root\r\nink. If he did not have these handy, he would write with a piece of\r\ncharcoal or the charred end of a stick, on a board, or on the under side\r\nof a chair or bench. He used the wooden fire shovel for a slate, shaving\r\nit off clean when both sides were full of figures. When he got hold of\r\npaper enough to make a copy-book he would go about transferring his\r\nnotes from boards, beams, under sides of the chairs and the table, and\r\nfrom all the queer places he had put them down, on the spur of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nBesides the books he had at hand, he borrowed all he could get, often\r\nwalking many miles for a book, until, as he once told a friend, he "read\r\nthrough every book he had ever heard of in that country, for a circuit\r\nof fifty miles"--quite a circulating library!\r\n\r\n\r\n"THE BEGINNING OF LOVE"\r\n\r\n"The thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." It must have been about\r\nthis time that the lad had the following experience, which he himself\r\nrelated to a legal friend, with his chair tilted back and his knees\r\n"cocked up" in the manner described by Cousin John Hanks:\r\n\r\n"Did you ever write out a story in your mind? I did when I was little\r\ncodger. One day a wagon with a lady and two girls and a man broke down\r\nnear us, and while they were fixing up, they cooked in our kitchen. The\r\nwoman had books and read us stories, and they were the first of the kind\r\nI ever heard. I took a great fancy to one of the girls; and when they\r\nwere gone I thought of her a good deal, and one day, when I was sitting\r\nout in the sun by the house, I wrote out a story in my mind.\r\n\r\n"I thought I took my father\'s horse and followed the wagon, and finally\r\nI found it, and they were surprised to see me.\r\n\r\n"I talked with the girl and persuaded her to elope with me; and that\r\nnight I put her on my horse and we started off across the prairie. After\r\nseveral hours we came to a camp; and when we rode up we found it was one\r\nwe had left a few hours before and went in.\r\n\r\n"The next night we tried again, and the same thing happened--the horse\r\ncame back to the same place; and then we concluded we ought not to\r\nelope. I stayed until I had persuaded her father that he ought to give\r\nher to me.\r\n\r\n"I always meant to write that story out and publish it, and I began\r\nonce; but I concluded it was not much of a story.\r\n\r\n"But I think that was the beginning of love with me."\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ABE CAME TO OWN WEEMS\'S "LIFE OF WASHINGTON"\r\n\r\nAbe\'s chief delight, if permitted to do so, was to lie in the shade of\r\nsome inviting tree and read. He liked to lie on his stomach before the\r\nfire at night, and often read as long as this flickering light lasted.\r\nHe sometimes took a book to bed to read as soon as the morning light\r\nbegan to come through the chinks between the logs beside his bed. He\r\nonce placed a book between the logs to have it handy in the morning, and\r\na storm came up and soaked it with dirty water from the "mud-daubed"\r\nmortar, plastered between the logs of the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe book happened to be Weems\'s "Life of Washington." Abe was in a sad\r\ndilemma. What could he say to the owner of the book, which he had\r\nborrowed from the meanest man in the neighborhood, Josiah Crawford, who\r\nwas so unpopular that he went by the nickname of "Old Blue Nose"?\r\n\r\nThe only course was to show the angry owner his precious volume, warped\r\nand stained as it was, and offer to do anything he could to repay him.\r\n\r\n"Abe," said "Old Blue Nose," with bloodcurdling friendliness, "bein\' as\r\nit\'s you, Abe, I won\'t be hard on you. You jest come over and pull\r\nfodder for me, and the book is yours."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Abe, his deep-set eyes twinkling in spite of himself\r\nat the thought of owning the story of the life of the greatest of\r\nheroes, "how much fodder?"\r\n\r\n"Wal," said old Josiah, "that book\'s worth seventy-five cents, at least.\r\nYou kin earn twenty-five cents a day--that will make three days. You\r\ncome and pull all you can in three days and you may have the book."\r\n\r\nThat was an exorbitant price, even if the book were new, but Abe was at\r\nthe old man\'s mercy. He realized this, and made the best of a bad\r\nbargain. He cheerfully did the work for a man who was mean enough to\r\ntake advantage of his misfortune. He comforted himself with the thought\r\nthat he would be the owner of the precious "Life of Washington." Long\r\nafterward, in a speech before the New Jersey Legislature, on his way to\r\nWashington to be inaugurated, like Washington, as President of the\r\nUnited States, he referred to this strange book.\r\n\r\n\r\n"THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH"\r\n\r\nOne morning, on his way to work, with an ax on his shoulder, his\r\nstepsister, Matilda Johnston, though forbidden by her mother to follow\r\nAbe, crept after him, and with a cat-like spring landed between his\r\nshoulders and pressed her sharp knees into the small of his back.\r\n\r\nTaken unawares, Abe staggered backward and ax and girl fell to the\r\nground together. The sharp implement cut her ankle badly, and\r\nmischievous Matilda shrieked with fright and pain when she saw the blood\r\ngushing from the wound. Young Lincoln tore a sleeve from his shirt to\r\nbandage the gash and bound up the ankle as well as he could. Then he\r\ntried to teach the still sobbing girl a lesson.\r\n\r\n"\'Tilda," he said gently, "I\'m surprised. Why did you disobey mother?"\r\n\r\nMatilda only wept silently, and the lad went on, "What are you going to\r\ntell mother about it?"\r\n\r\n"Tell her I did it with the ax," sobbed the young girl. "That will be\r\nthe truth, too."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Abe severely, "that\'s the truth, but not _all_ the truth.\r\nYou just tell the whole truth, \'Tilda, and trust mother for the rest."\r\n\r\nMatilda went limping home and told her mother the whole story, and the\r\ngood woman was so sorry for her that, as the girl told Abe that evening,\r\n"she didn\'t even scold me."\r\n\r\n\r\n"BOUNDING A THOUGHT--NORTH, SOUTH, EAST AND WEST"\r\n\r\nAbe sometimes heard things in the simple conversation of friends that\r\ndisturbed him because they seemed beyond his comprehension. He said of\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n"I remember how, when a child, I used to get irritated when any one\r\ntalked to me in a way I couldn\'t understand.\r\n\r\n"I do not think I ever got angry with anything else in my life; but that\r\nalways disturbed my temper--and has ever since.\r\n\r\n"I can remember going to my little bedroom, after hearing the neighbors\r\ntalk of an evening with my father, and spending no small part of the\r\nnight walking up and down, trying to make out what was the exact\r\nmeaning of some of their, to me, dark sayings.\r\n\r\n"I could not sleep, although I tried to, when I got on such a hunt for\r\nan idea; and when I thought I had got it, I was not satisfied until I\r\nhad repeated it over and over, and had put in language plain enough, as\r\nI thought, for any boy I knew to comprehend.\r\n\r\n"This was a kind of a passion with me, and it has stuck by me; for I am\r\nnever easy now when I am bounding a thought, till I have bounded it\r\neast, and bounded it west, and bounded it north, and bounded it south."\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH PRAISE FROM HIS STEPMOTHER\r\n\r\nNot long before her death, Mr. Herndon, Lincoln\'s law partner, called\r\nupon Mrs. Sarah Lincoln to collect material for a "Life of Lincoln" he\r\nwas preparing to write. This was the best of all the things she related\r\nof her illustrious stepson:\r\n\r\n"I can say what scarcely one mother in a thousand can say, Abe never\r\ngave me a cross word or look, and never refused, in fact or appearance,\r\nto do anything I asked him. His mind and mine seemed to run together.\r\n\r\n"I had a son, John, who was raised with Abe. Both were good boys, but I\r\nmust say, both now being dead, that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or\r\nexpect to see."\r\n\r\n"Charity begins at home"--and so do truth and honesty. Abraham Lincoln\r\ncould not have become so popular all over the world on account of his\r\nhonest kindheartedness if he had not been loyal, obedient and loving\r\ntoward those at home. Popularity, also, "begins at home." A mean,\r\ndisagreeable, dishonest boy may become a king, because he was "to the\r\nmanner born." But only a good, kind, honest man, considerate of others,\r\ncan be elected President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nABE AND THE NEIGHBORS\r\n\r\n\r\n"PREACHING" AGAINST CRUELTY TO ANIMALS\r\n\r\nNat Grigsby stated once that writing compositions was not required by\r\nSchoolmaster Crawford, but "Abe took it up on his own account," and his\r\nfirst essay was against cruelty to animals.\r\n\r\nThe boys of the neighborhood made a practice of catching terrapins and\r\nlaying live coals on their backs. Abe caught a group of them at this\r\ncruel sport one day, and rushed to the relief of the helpless turtle.\r\nSnatching the shingle that one of the boys was using to handle the\r\ncoals, he brushed them off the turtle\'s shell, and with angry tears in\r\nhis eyes, proceeded to use it on one of the offenders, while he called\r\nthe rest a lot of cowards.\r\n\r\nOne day his stepbrother, John Johnston, according to his sister Matilda,\r\n"caught a terrapin, brought it to the place where Abe was \'preaching,\'\r\nthrew it against a tree and crushed its shell." Abe then preached\r\nagainst cruelty to animals, contending that "an ant\'s life is as sweet\r\nto it as ours is to us."\r\n\r\n\r\nROUGHLY DISCIPLINED FOR BEING "FORWARD"\r\n\r\nAbe was compelled to leave school on the slightest pretext to work for\r\nthe neighbors. He was so big and strong--attaining his full height at\r\nseventeen--that his services were more in demand than those of his\r\nstepbrother, John Johnston, or of Cousin Dennis. Abe was called lazy\r\nbecause the neighbors shared the idea of Thomas Lincoln, that his\r\nreading and studying were only a pretext for shirking. Yet he was never\r\nso idle as either Dennis Hanks or John Johnston, who were permitted to\r\ngo hunting or fishing with Tom Lincoln, while Abe stayed out of school\r\nto do the work that one of the three older men should have done.\r\n\r\nAbe\'s father was kinder in many ways to his stepchildren than he was to\r\nhis own son. This may have been due to the fact that he did not wish to\r\nbe thought "partial" to his own child. No doubt Abe was "forward." He\r\nliked to take part in any discussion, and sometimes he broke into the\r\nconversation when his opinion had not been asked. Besides, he got into\r\narguments with his fellow-laborers, and wasted the time belonging to his\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\nOne day, according to Dennis, they were all working together in the\r\nfield, when a man rode up on horseback and asked a question. Abe was the\r\nfirst to mount the fence to answer the stranger and engage him in\r\nconversation. To teach his son better "manners" in the presence of his\r\n"superiors," Thomas Lincoln struck Abe a heavy blow which knocked him\r\nbackward off the fence, and silenced him for a time.\r\n\r\nOf course, every one present laughed at Abe\'s discomfiture, and the\r\nneighbors approved of Thomas Lincoln\'s rude act as a matter of\r\ndiscipline. In their opinion Abe Lincoln was getting altogether too\r\nsmart. While they enjoyed his homely wit and good nature, they did not\r\nlike to admit that he was in any way their superior. A visitor to\r\nSpringfield, Ill., will even now find some of Lincoln\'s old neighbors\r\neager to say "there were a dozen smarter men in this city than Lincoln"\r\nwhen he "happened to get nominated for the presidency!"\r\n\r\n\r\nSPORTS AND PASTIMES\r\n\r\nAbe was "hail fellow, well met" everywhere. The women comprehended his\r\ntrue greatness before the men did so. There was a rough gallantry about\r\nhim, which, though lacking in "polish," was true, "heart-of-oak"\r\npoliteness. He wished every one well. His whole life passed with "malice\r\ntoward none, with charity for all."\r\n\r\nWhen he "went out evenings" Abe Lincoln took the greatest pains to make\r\neverybody comfortable and happy. He was sure to bring in the biggest\r\nbacklog and make the brightest fire. He read "the funniest fortunes" for\r\nthe young people from the sparks as they flew up the chimney. He was the\r\nbest helper in paring the apples, shelling the corn and cracking the\r\nnuts for the evening\'s refreshments.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to spelling school, after the first few times, he was not\r\nallowed to take part in the spelling match because everybody knew that\r\nthe side that "chose first" would get Abe Lincoln and he always "spelled\r\ndown." But he went just the same and had a good time himself if he could\r\nadd to the enjoyment of the rest.\r\n\r\nHe went swimming, warm evenings, with the boys, and ran races, jumped\r\nand wrestled at noon-times, which was supposed to be given up to eating\r\nand resting. He was "the life" of the husking-bee and barn raising, and\r\nwas always present, often as a judge because of his humor, fairness and\r\ntact, at horse races. He engaged heartily in every kind of "manly sport"\r\nwhich did not entail unnecessary suffering upon helpless animals.\r\n\r\nCoon hunting, however, was an exception. The coon was a pest and a\r\nplague to the farmer, so it should be got rid of. He once told the\r\nfollowing story:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE YELLOW "COON DOG"\r\n\r\n"My father had a little yellow house dog which invariably gave the alarm\r\nif we boys undertook to slip away unobserved after night had set in--as\r\nwe sometimes did--to go coon hunting. One night my brother, John\r\nJohnston, and I, with the usual complement of boys required for a\r\nsuccessful coon hunt, took the insignificant little cur with us.\r\n\r\n"We located the coveted coon, killed him, and then in a sporting vein,\r\nsewed the coon skin on the little dog.\r\n\r\n"It struggled vigorously during the operation of sewing on, and when\r\nreleased made a bee-line for home. Some larger dogs on the way, scenting\r\ncoon, tracked the little animal home and apparently mistaking him for a\r\nreal coon, speedily demolished him. The next morning, father found,\r\nlying in his yard, the lifeless remains of yellow \'Joe,\' with strong\r\ncircumstantial evidence, in the form of fragments of coon skin, against\r\nus.\r\n\r\n"Father was much incensed at his death, but as John and I, scantily\r\nprotected from the morning wind, stood shivering in the doorway, we felt\r\nassured that little yellow Joe would never again be able to sound the\r\nalarm of another coon hunt."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE "CHIN FLY" AS AN INCENTIVE TO WORK\r\n\r\nWhile he was President, Mr. Lincoln told Henry J. Raymond, the founder\r\nof the New York _Times_, the following story of an experience he had\r\nabout this time, while working with his stepbrother in a cornfield:\r\n\r\n"Raymond," said he, "you were brought up on a farm, were you not? Then\r\nyou know what a \'chin fly\' is. My brother and I were plowing corn once,\r\nI driving the horse and he holding the plow. The horse was lazy, but on\r\none occasion he rushed across the field so that I, with my long legs,\r\ncould scarcely keep pace with him. On reaching the end of the furrow I\r\nfound an enormous chin fly fastened upon the horse and I knocked it off.\r\nMy brother asked me what I did that for. I told him I didn\'t want the\r\nold horse bitten in that way.\r\n\r\n"\'Why,\' said my brother,\'that\'s all that made him go.\'"\r\n\r\n"Now if Mr. Chase (the Secretary of the Treasury) has a presidential\r\n\'chin fly\' biting him, I\'m not going to knock it off, if it will only\r\nmake his department go."\r\n\r\n\r\n"OLD BLUE NOSE\'S" HIRED MAN\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be the "irony of fate" that Abe should have to work for\r\n"Old Blue Nose" as a farm hand. But the lad liked Mrs. Crawford, and\r\nLincoln\'s sister Nancy lived there, at the same time, as\r\nmaid-of-all-work. Another attraction, the Crawford family was rich, in\r\nAbe\'s eyes, in possessing several books, which he was glad of the chance\r\nto read.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crawford told many things about young Lincoln that might otherwise\r\nhave been lost. She said "Abe was very polite, in his awkward way,\r\ntaking off his hat to me and bowing. He was a sensitive lad, never\r\ncoming where he was not wanted. He was tender and kind--like his sister.\r\n\r\n"He liked to hang around and gossip and joke with the women. After he\r\nhad wasted too much time this way, he would exclaim:\r\n\r\n"\'Well, this won\'t buy the child a coat,\' and the long-legged hired boy\r\nwould stride away and catch up with the others."\r\n\r\nOne day when he was asked to kill a hog, Abe answered promptly that he\r\nhad never done that, "but if you\'ll risk the hog, I\'ll risk myself!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Crawford told also about "going to meeting" in those primitive\r\ndays:\r\n\r\n"At that time we thought it nothing to go eight or ten miles. The ladies\r\ndid not stop for the want of a shawl or riding dress, or horses. In the\r\nwinter time they would put on their husbands\' old overcoats, wrap up\r\ntheir little ones, and take two or three of them on their beasts, while\r\ntheir husbands would walk.\r\n\r\n"In winter time they would hold church in some of the neighbors\' houses.\r\nAt such times they were always treated with the utmost kindness; a\r\nbasket of apples, or turnips--apples were scarce in those days--was set\r\nout. Sometimes potatoes were used for a \'treat.\' In old Mr. Linkhorn\'s\r\n(Lincoln\'s) house a plate of potatoes, washed and pared nicely, was\r\nhanded around."\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATS OF STRENGTH\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the boy was growing to tall manhood, both in body and in mind.\r\nThe neighbors, who failed to mark his mental growth, were greatly\r\nimpressed with his physical strength. The Richardson family, with whom\r\nAbe seemed to have lived as hired man, used to tell marvelous tales of\r\nhis prowess, some of which may have grown somewhat in the telling. Mr.\r\nRichardson declared that the young man could carry as heavy a load as\r\n"three ordinary men." He saw Abe pick up and walk away with "a chicken\r\nhouse, made up of poles pinned together, and covered, that weighed at\r\nleast six hundred if not much more."\r\n\r\nWhen the Richardsons were building their corn-crib, Abe saw three or\r\nfour men getting ready to carry several huge posts or timbers on\r\n"sticks" between them. Watching his chance, he coolly stepped in,\r\nshouldered all the timbers at once and walked off alone with them,\r\ncarrying them to the place desired. He performed these feats off-hand,\r\nsmiling down in undisguised pleasure as the men around him expressed\r\ntheir amazement. It seemed to appeal to his sense of humor as well as\r\nhis desire to help others out of their difficulties.\r\n\r\nAnother neighbor, "old Mr. Wood," said of Abe: "He could strike, with a\r\nmaul, a heavier blow than any other man. He could sink an ax deeper\r\ninto wood than any man I ever saw."\r\n\r\nDennis Hanks used to tell that if you heard Abe working in the woods\r\nalone, felling trees, you would think three men, at least, were at work\r\nthere--the trees came crashing down so fast.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion after he had been threshing wheat for Mr. Turnham, the\r\nfarmer-constable whose "Revised Statutes of Indiana" Abe had devoured,\r\nLincoln was walking back, late at night from Gentryville, where he and a\r\nnumber of cronies had spent the evening. As the youths were picking\r\ntheir way along the frozen road, they saw a dark object on the ground by\r\nthe roadside. They found it to be an old sot they knew too well lying\r\nthere, dead drunk. Lincoln stopped, and the rest, knowing the tenderness\r\nof his heart, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Aw, let him alone, Abe. \'Twon\'t do him no good. He\'s made his bed, let\r\nhim lay in it!"\r\n\r\nThe rest laughed--for the "bed" was freezing mud. But Abe could see no\r\nhumor in the situation. The man might be run over, or freeze to death.\r\nTo abandon any human being in such a plight seemed too monstrous to him.\r\nThe other young men hurried on in the cold, shrugging their shoulders\r\nand shaking their heads--"Poor Abe!--he\'s a hopeless case," and left\r\nLincoln to do the work of a Good Samaritan alone. He had no beast on\r\nwhich to carry the dead weight of the drunken man, whom he vainly tried,\r\nagain and again, to arouse to a sense of the predicament he was in. At\r\nlast the young man took up the apparently lifeless body of the\r\nmud-covered man in his strong arms, and carried him a quarter of a mile\r\nto a deserted cabin, where he made up a fire and warmed and nursed the\r\nold drunkard the rest of that night. Then Abe gave him "a good talking\r\nto," and the unfortunate man is said to have been so deeply impressed by\r\nthe young man\'s kindness that he heeded the temperance lecture and never\r\nagain risked his life as he had done that night. When the old man told\r\nJohn Hanks of Abe\'s Herculean effort to save him, he added:\r\n\r\n"It was mighty clever in Abe Lincoln to tote me to a warm fire that cold\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n\r\nIN JONES\' STORE\r\n\r\nWhile Abe was working for the farmers round about his father\'s farm he\r\nspent many of his evenings in Jones\' grocery "talking politics" and\r\nother things with the men, who also gathered there. Mr. Jones took a\r\nLouisville paper, which young Lincoln read eagerly. Slavery was a live\r\npolitical topic then, and Abe soon acquired quite a reputation as a\r\nstump orator.\r\n\r\nAs he read the "Indiana Statutes" he was supposed to "know more law than\r\nthe constable." In fact, his taste for the law was so pronounced at that\r\nearly age that he went, sometimes, fifteen miles to Boonville, as a\r\nspectator in the county court. Once he heard a lawyer of ability, named\r\nBreckinridge, defend an accused murderer there. It was a great plea; the\r\ntall country boy knew it and, pushing through the crowd, reached out his\r\nlong, coatless arm to congratulate the lawyer, who looked at the awkward\r\nyouth in amazement and passed on without acknowledging Abe\'s compliment.\r\nThe two men met again in Washington, more than thirty years later, under\r\nvery different circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut there were things other than politics discussed at the country\r\nstore, and Abe Lincoln often raised a laugh at the expense of some\r\nbraggart or bully. There was "Uncle Jimmy" Larkins, who posed as the\r\nhero of his own stories. In acknowledgment of Abe\'s authority as a\r\njudge of horse flesh, "Uncle Jimmy" was boasting of his horse\'s\r\nsuperiority in a recent fox chase. But young Lincoln seemed to pay no\r\nheed. Larkins repeated:\r\n\r\n"Abe, I\'ve got the best horse in the world; he won the race and never\r\ndrew a long breath."\r\n\r\nYoung Lincoln still appeared not to be paying attention. "Uncle Jimmy"\r\npersisted. He was bound to make Abe hear. He reiterated:\r\n\r\n"I say, Abe, I have got the best horse in the world; after all that\r\nrunning he never drew a long breath."\r\n\r\n"Well, Larkins," drawled young Lincoln, "why don\'t you tell us how many\r\n_short_ breaths he drew." The laugh was on the boastful and discomfited\r\nLarkins.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRYING TO TEACH ASTRONOMY TO A YOUNG GIRL\r\n\r\nAbe\'s efforts were not always so well received, for he was sometimes\r\nmisunderstood. The neighbors used to think the Lincoln boy was secretly\r\nin love with Kate Roby, the pretty girl he had helped out of a dilemma\r\nin the spelling class. Several years after that episode, Abe and Kate\r\nwere sitting on a log, about sunset, talking:\r\n\r\n"Abe," said Kate, "the sun\'s goin\' down."\r\n\r\n"Reckon not," Abe answered, "we\'re coming up, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you s\'pose I got eyes?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know you have; but it\'s the earth that goes round. The sun\r\nstands as still as a tree. When we\'re swung round so we can\'t see it any\r\nmore, the light\'s cut off and we call it night."\r\n\r\n"What a fool you are, Abe Lincoln!" exclaimed Kate, who was not to blame\r\nfor her ignorance, for astronomy had never been taught in Crawford\'s\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY DEATH OF SISTER NANCY\r\n\r\nWhile brother and sister were working for "Old Blue Nose," Aaron\r\nGrigsby, "Nat\'s" brother, was "paying attention" to Nancy Lincoln. They\r\nwere soon married. Nancy was only eighteen. When she was nineteen Mrs.\r\nAaron Grigsby died. Her love for Abe had almost amounted to idolatry. In\r\nsome ways she resembled him. He, in turn, was deeply devoted to his only\r\nsister.\r\n\r\nThe family did not stay long at Pigeon Creek after the loss of Nancy,\r\nwho was buried, not beside her mother, but with the Grigsbys in the\r\nchurchyard of the old Pigeon Creek meeting-house.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARNING HIS FIRST DOLLAR\r\n\r\nMuch as Abraham Lincoln had "worked out" as a hired man, his father kept\r\nthe money, as he had a legal right to do, not giving the boy any of the\r\nresults of his hard labor, for, strong as he was, his pay was only\r\ntwenty-five or thirty cents a day. Abe accepted this as right and\r\nproper. He never complained of it.\r\n\r\nAfter he became President, Lincoln told his Secretary of State the\r\nfollowing story of the first dollar he ever had for his own:\r\n\r\n"Seward," he said, "did you ever hear how I earned my first dollar?"\r\n"No," replied Seward. "Well," said he, "I was about eighteen years of\r\nage . . . and had constructed a flatboat. . . . A steamer was going down\r\nthe river. We have, you know, no wharves on the western streams, and\r\nthe custom was, if passengers were at any of the landings they had to\r\ngo out in a boat, the steamer stopping and taking them on board. I\r\nwas contemplating my new boat, and wondering whether I could make it\r\nstronger or improve it in any part, when two men with trunks came down\r\nto the shore in carriages, and looking at the different boats, singled\r\nout mine, and asked:\r\n\r\n"\'Who owns this?\'\r\n\r\n"I answered modestly, \'I do.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Will you,\' said one of them, \'take us and our trunks out to the\r\nsteamer?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Certainly,\' said I. I was very glad to have a chance of earning\r\nsomething, and supposed that they would give me a couple of \'bits.\' The\r\ntrunks were put in my boat, the passengers seated themselves on them,\r\nand I sculled them out to the steamer. They got on board, and I lifted\r\nthe trunks and put them on deck. The steamer was moving away when I\r\ncalled out:\r\n\r\n"\'You have forgotten to pay me.\'\r\n\r\n"Each of them took from his pocket a silver half-dollar and threw it on\r\nthe bottom of my boat. I could scarcely believe my eyes as I picked up\r\nthe money. You may think it was a very little thing, and in these days\r\nit seems to me like a trifle, but it was a most important incident in my\r\nlife. I could scarcely credit that I, a poor boy, had earned a dollar in\r\nless than a day--that by honest work I had earned a dollar. I was a more\r\nhopeful and thoughtful boy from that time."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMOVING TO ILLINOIS\r\n\r\n\r\n"FOLLOWING THE RIVER"\r\n\r\nThomas Lincoln had become restless again. Fourteen years was a long time\r\nfor him to live in one place. Abe was seven years old when they came\r\nover from Kentucky, and he was now nearly twenty-one. During that time\r\nThomas had lost his wife, Nancy, and his only daughter, who bore her\r\nmother\'s name. While the land he had chosen was fertile enough, the want\r\nof water had always been a sad drawback. The desire to try his fortunes\r\nin a newer country had taken possession of him.\r\n\r\nJohn Hanks had gone to Illinois, and had written back that everything\r\nwas more favorable there for making a living. Thomas Lincoln had not\r\nbeen successful in Indiana. His children\'s prospects seemed to be\r\nagainst them. After working as a hired hand on the surrounding farms,\r\nAbe had served for a time as a ferryman, and, working by the river, had\r\nlearned to build the boat with which he had earned his first dollar.\r\n\r\nAs George Washington longed to go to sea, Abraham Lincoln seems to have\r\nyearned to "follow the river." He tried to hire out as deck hand, but\r\nhis age was against him. He soon had a chance to go "down river" to New\r\nOrleans, with his friend, Allen Gentry, the son of the man for whom\r\nGentryville was named. Allen afterward married Kate Roby. A flatboat\r\nbelonging to Allen\'s father was loaded with bacon and other farm\r\nmerchandise for the southern market. Allen went in charge of the\r\nexpedition, and young Lincoln was engaged as "bow hand." They started in\r\nApril, 1828. There was nothing to do but steer the unwieldy craft with\r\nthe current. The flatboat was made to float down stream only. It was to\r\nbe broken up at New Orleans and sold for lumber.\r\n\r\nThe two young men from Indiana made the trip without incident until they\r\ncame to the plantation of Madame Duchesne, six miles from Baton Rouge,\r\nwhere they moored their raft for the night. There they heard the\r\nstealthy footsteps of midnight marauders on board.\r\n\r\nYoung Gentry was first aroused. He sprang up and found a gang of\r\nlawless negroes on deck, evidently looking for plunder, and thinking so\r\nmany of them could easily cow or handle the two white men.\r\n\r\n"Bring the guns, Abe!" shouted Allen. "Shoot them!" Abraham Lincoln was\r\namong them, brandishing a club--they had no guns. The negroes were\r\nfrightened not only by the fierce, commanding form of their tall\r\nadversary, but also by his giant strength. The two white men routed the\r\nwhole black crew, but Abraham Lincoln received a wound in the encounter,\r\nand bore the scar of it to his dying day.\r\n\r\nThe trip required about three months, going and returning, and the two\r\nadventurers from Gentryville came back in June, with good stories of\r\ntheir experiences to tell in Jones\' store.\r\n\r\nNot long after this Thomas Lincoln, in response to an urgent invitation\r\nfrom John Hanks, decided to move to Illinois. It took a long time, after\r\ngathering in the fall crops, for Thomas Lincoln to have a "vandoo" and\r\nsell his corn and hogs. As for selling his farm, it had never really\r\nbelonged to him. He simply turned it over to Mr. Gentry, who held a\r\nmortgage on it. It was February, 1830, before the pioneer wagon got\r\nunder way. The emigrant family consisted of Thomas Lincoln and Sarah,\r\nhis wife, Abraham, and John Johnston; Sarah and Matilda Johnston were\r\nboth married, and, with their husbands, a young man named Hall and\r\nDennis Hanks, formed the rest of the party. The women rode with their\r\nhousehold goods in a great covered cart drawn by two yoke of oxen.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRAVELING PEDDLER\r\n\r\nMerchant Jones, for whom Abe had worked that fall and winter, after his\r\nreturn from New Orleans, sold the young man a pack of "notions" to\r\npeddle along the road to Illinois. "A set of knives and forks," related\r\nMr. Jones\' son afterward, "was the largest item on the bill. The other\r\nitems were needles, pins, thread, buttons, and other little domestic\r\nnecessities. When the Lincolns reached their new home, Abraham wrote\r\nback to my father stating that he had doubled his money on his purchases\r\nby selling them along the road. Unfortunately we did not keep that\r\nletter, not thinking how highly we would prize it afterward."\r\n\r\nIn the early days of his presidency, an international problem came\r\nbefore the cabinet which reminded Mr. Lincoln of an experience he had on\r\nthis journey, so he told the several secretaries this story:\r\n\r\n"The situation just now reminds me of a fix I got into some thirty years\r\nago when I was peddling \'notions\' on the way from Indiana to Illinois. I\r\ndidn\'t have a large stock, but I charged large prices and I made money.\r\nPerhaps you don\'t see what I am driving at.\r\n\r\n"Just before we left Indiana and were crossing into Illinois we came\r\nacross a small farmhouse full of children. These ranged in age from\r\nseventeen years to seventeen months, and were all in tears. The mother\r\nof the family was red-headed and red-faced, and the whip she held in her\r\nright hand led to the inference that she had been chastising her brood.\r\nThe father of the family, a meek-looking, mild-mannered, tow-headed\r\nchap, was standing at the front door--to all appearances waiting his\r\nturn!\r\n\r\n"I thought there wasn\'t much use in asking the head of that house if she\r\nwanted any \'notions.\' She was too busy. It was evident that an\r\ninsurrection had been in progress, but it was pretty well quelled when I\r\ngot there. She saw me when I came up, and from her look I thought she\r\nsurmised that I intended to interfere. Advancing to the doorway--roughly\r\npushing her husband aside--she demanded my business.\r\n\r\n"\'Nothing, ma\'am,\' I answered as gently as possible. \'I merely dropped\r\nin, as I came along, to see how things were going.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Well, you needn\'t wait,\' she said in an irritated way; \'there\'s\r\ntrouble here, and lots of it, too, but I kin manage my own affairs\r\nwithout the help of outsiders. This is jest a family row, but I\'ll teach\r\nthese brats their places if I hev to lick the hide off every one of\r\nthem. I don\'t do much talking, but I run this house, an\' I don\'t want no\r\none sneakin\' round tryin\' to find out how I do it either.\'\r\n\r\n"That\'s the case here with us. We must let the other nations know that\r\nwe propose to settle our family row in our own way, an\' teach these\r\nbrats (the seceding States) their places, and, like the old woman, we\r\ndon\'t want any \'sneakin\' round\' by other countries, that would like to\r\nfind out how we are going to do it either."\r\n\r\n\r\n"WINNING A DOG\'S GRATITUDE"\r\n\r\nAbe strode along in the mud, driving the four oxen much of the time,\r\nfor the houses he could visit with his peddler\'s pack were few and far\r\nbetween. A dog belonging to one of the family--an insignificant little\r\ncur--fell behind. After the oxen had floundered through the mud, snow\r\nand ice of a prairie stream, they discovered that the animal was\r\nmissing. The other men of the party thought they could now get rid of\r\nthe little nuisance, and even the women were anxious, as the hour was\r\nlate, to go on and find a place to camp for the night. To turn back with\r\nthe clumsy ox-team and lumbering emigrant wagon was out of the question.\r\n\r\nAbraham gave the whip to one of the other men and turned back to see if\r\nhe could discern the dog anywhere. He discovered it running up and down\r\non the other bank of the river, in great distress, for the swift current\r\nwas filled with floating ice and the poor little creature was afraid to\r\nmake the attempt to swim across. After whistling in vain to encourage\r\nthe dog to try if it would, the tender-hearted youth went to its rescue.\r\nReferring to the incident himself afterward, he said:\r\n\r\n"I could not endure the idea of abandoning even a dog. Pulling off shoes\r\nand socks, I waded across the stream and triumphantly returned with the\r\nshivering animal under my arm. His frantic leaps of joy and other\r\nevidences of a dog\'s gratitude amply repaid me for all the exposure I\r\nhad undergone."\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLITTING THE HISTORIC RAILS\r\n\r\nAfter two weary weeks of floundering through muddy prairies and jolting\r\nover rough forest roads, now and then fording swollen and dangerous\r\nstreams, the Lincolns were met near Decatur, Illinois, by Cousin John\r\nHanks, and given a hearty welcome. John had chosen a spot not far from\r\nhis own home, and had the logs all ready to build a cabin for the\r\nnewcomers. Besides young Abe, with the strength of three, there were\r\nfive men in the party, so they were able to erect their first home in\r\nIllinois without asking the help of the neighbors, as was customary for\r\na "raising" of that kind.\r\n\r\nNicolay and Hay, President Lincoln\'s private secretaries, in their great\r\nlife of their chief, gave the following account of the splitting of the\r\nrails which afterward became the talk of the civilized world:\r\n\r\n"Without the assistance of John Hanks he plowed fifteen acres, and\r\nsplit, from the tall walnut trees of the primeval forest, enough rails\r\nto surround them with a fence. Little did either dream, while engaged in\r\nthis work, that the day would come when the appearance of John Hanks in\r\na public meeting with two of these rails on his shoulder, would\r\nelectrify a State convention, and kindle throughout the country a\r\ncontagious and passionate enthusiasm whose results would reach to\r\nendless generations."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSTARTING OUT FOR HIMSELF\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS FATHER AND HIS "FREEDOM SUIT"\r\n\r\nAccording to his own account, Abe had made about thirty dollars as a\r\npeddler, besides bearing the brunt of the labor of the journey, though\r\nthere were four grown men in the combined family. As he had passed his\r\ntwenty-first birthday on the road, he really had the right to claim\r\nthese profits as his own. His father, who had, for ten years, exacted\r\nAbraham\'s meager, hard-earned wages, should at least have given the boy\r\na part of that thirty dollars for a "freedom suit" of clothes, as was\r\nthe custom then.\r\n\r\nBut neither Thomas Lincoln nor his son seems to have thought of such a\r\nthing. Instead of entertaining resentment, Abraham stayed by, doing all\r\nhe could to make his father and stepmother comfortable before he left\r\nthem altogether. Mrs. Lincoln had two daughters and sons-in-law, besides\r\nJohn Johnston, so Abe might easily have excused himself from looking\r\nafter the welfare of his parents. Though his father had seemed to favor\r\nhis stepchildren in preference to his own son, Mrs. Lincoln had been\r\n"like an own mother to him," and he never ceased to show his gratitude\r\nby being "like an own son to her."\r\n\r\nThe first work Abe did in that neighborhood was to split a thousand\r\nrails for a pair of trousers, at the rate of four hundred rails per yard\r\nof "brown jeans dyed with walnut bark." The young man\'s breeches cost\r\nhim about four hundred rails more than they would if he had been a man\r\nof ordinary height.\r\n\r\nBut Abraham hovered about, helping clear a little farm, and making the\r\ncabin comfortable while he was earning his own "freedom suit." He saw\r\nthe spring planting done and that a garden was made for his stepmother\r\nbefore he went out of ready reach of the old people.\r\n\r\nOne special reason Thomas Lincoln had for leaving Indiana was to get\r\naway from "the milksick." But the fall of 1830 was a very bad season in\r\nIllinois for chills and fever. The father and, in fact, nearly the whole\r\nfamily left at home suffered so much from malaria that they were\r\nthoroughly discouraged. The interior of their little cabin was a sorry\r\nsight--Thomas and his wife were both afflicted at once, and one married\r\ndaughter was almost as ill. They were all so sick that Thomas Lincoln\r\nregistered a shaky but vehement resolve that as soon as they could\r\ntravel they would "git out o\' thar!" He had been so determined to move\r\nto Illinois that no persuasion could induce him to give up the project,\r\ntherefore his disappointment was the more keen and bitter.\r\n\r\nThe first winter the Lincolns spent in Illinois was memorable for its\r\nseverity. It is still spoken of in that region as "the winter of the big\r\nsnow." Cattle and sheep froze to death or died of exposure and\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING THE FLATBOAT\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring after "the big snow," John Hanks, Lincoln and John\r\nJohnston met Denton Offutt, a man who was to wield an influence on the\r\nlife of young Lincoln. Offutt engaged the three to take a load of\r\nproduce and other merchandise to New Orleans to sell. John Hanks, the\r\nmost reliable member of the Hanks family, gave the following account of\r\nthe way he managed to bring Abe and his stepbrother into the\r\ntransaction: "He wanted me to go badly but I waited before answering. I\r\nhunted up Abe, and I introduced him and John Johnston, his stepbrother,\r\nto Offutt. After some talk we at last made an engagement with Offutt at\r\nfifty cents a day and sixty dollars to make the trip to New Orleans. Abe\r\nand I came down the Sangamon River in a canoe in March, 1831, and landed\r\nat what is now called Jamestown, five miles east of Springfield."\r\n\r\nDenton Offutt spent so much time drinking in a tavern at the village of\r\nSpringfield that the flatboat was not ready when the trio arrived to\r\ntake it and its cargo down the river. Their employer met them on their\r\narrival with profuse apologies, and the three men were engaged to build\r\nthe boat and load it up for the journey.\r\n\r\nDuring the four weeks required to build the raft, the men of that\r\nneighborhood became acquainted with young Lincoln. A man named John Roll\r\nhas given this description of Abe\'s appearance at that time:\r\n\r\n"He was a tall, gaunt young man, dressed in a suit of blue homespun,\r\nconsisting of a roundabout jacket, waistcoat, and breeches which came to\r\nwithin about three inches of his feet. The latter were encased in\r\nrawhide boots, into the tops of which, most of the time, his pantaloons\r\nwere stuffed. He wore a soft felt hat which had once been black, but\r\nnow, as its owner dryly remarked, \'was sunburned until it was a combine\r\nof colors.\'"\r\n\r\nThere was a sawmill in Sangamontown, and it was the custom for the "men\r\nfolks" of the neighborhood to assemble near it at noon and in the\r\nevening, and sit on a peeled log which had been rolled out for the\r\npurpose. Young Lincoln soon joined this group and at once became a great\r\nfavorite because of his stories and jokes. His stories were so funny\r\nthat "whenever he\'d end \'em up in his unexpected way the boys on the log\r\nwould whoop and roll off." In this way the log was polished smooth as\r\nglass, and came to be known in the neighborhood as "Abe\'s log."\r\n\r\nA traveling juggler came one day while the boat was building and gave an\r\nexhibition in the house of one of the neighbors. This magician asked for\r\nAbe\'s hat to cook eggs in. Lincoln hesitated, but gave this explanation\r\nfor his delay: "It was out of respect for the eggs--not care for my\r\nhat!"\r\n\r\n\r\nABE LINCOLN SAVES THREE LIVES\r\n\r\nWhile they were at work on the flatboat the humorous young stranger from\r\nIndiana became the hero of a thrilling adventure, described as follows\r\nby John Roll, who was an eye witness to the whole scene:\r\n\r\n"It was the spring following \'the winter of the deep snow.\' Walter\r\nCarman, John Seamon, myself, and at times others of the Carman boys, had\r\nhelped Abe in building the boat, and when we had finished we went to\r\nwork to make a dug-out, or canoe, to be used as a small boat with the\r\nflat. We found a suitable log about an eighth of a mile up the river,\r\nand with our axes went to work under Lincoln\'s direction. The river was\r\nvery high, fairly \'booming.\' After the dug-out was ready to launch we\r\ntook it to the edge of the water, and made ready to \'let her go,\' when\r\nWalter Carman and John Seamon jumped in as the boat struck the water,\r\neach one anxious to be the first to get a ride. As they shot out from\r\nthe shore they found they were unable to make any headway against the\r\nstrong current. Carman had the paddle, and Seamon was in the stern of\r\nthe boat. Lincoln shouted to them to head up-stream and \'work back to\r\nshore,\' but they found themselves powerless against the stream. At last\r\nthey began to pull for the wreck of an old flatboat, the first ever\r\nbuilt on the Sangamon, which had sunk and gone to pieces, leaving one of\r\nthe stanchions sticking above the water. Just as they reached it Seamon\r\nmade a grab, and caught hold of the stanchion, when the canoe capsized,\r\nleaving Seamon clinging to the old timber and throwing Carman into the\r\nstream. It carried him down with the speed of a mill-race. Lincoln\r\nraised his voice above the roar of the flood, and yelled to Carman to\r\nswim for an elm tree which stood almost in the channel, which the action\r\nof the water had changed.\r\n\r\n"Carman, being a good swimmer, succeeded in catching a branch, and\r\npulled himself up out of the water, which was very cold, and had almost\r\nchilled him to death; and there he sat, shivering and chattering in the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n"Lincoln, seeing Carman safe, called out to Seamon to let go the\r\nstanchion and swim for the tree. With some hesitation he obeyed, and\r\nstruck out, while Lincoln cheered and directed him from the bank. As\r\nSeamon neared the tree he made one grab for a branch, and, missing it,\r\nwent under the water. Another desperate lunge was successful, and he\r\nclimbed up beside Carman.\r\n\r\n"Things were pretty exciting now, for there were two men in the tree,\r\nand the boat gone. It was a cold, raw April day, and there was great\r\ndanger of the men becoming benumbed and falling back into the water.\r\nLincoln called out to them to keep their spirits up and he would save\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"The village had been alarmed by this time, and many people had come\r\ndown to the bank. Lincoln procured a rope and tied it to a log. He\r\ncalled all hands to come and help roll the log into the water, and,\r\nafter this had been done, he, with the assistance of several others,\r\ntowed it some distance up the stream. A daring young fellow by the name\r\nof \'Jim\' Dorell then took his seat on the end of the log, and it was\r\npushed out into the current, with the expectation that it would be\r\ncarried down stream against the tree where Seamon and Carman were.\r\n\r\n"The log was well directed, and went straight to the tree; but Jim, in\r\nhis impatience to help his friends, fell a victim to his good\r\nintentions. Making a frantic grab at a branch, he raised himself off the\r\nlog, which was swept from under him by the raging waters and he soon\r\njoined the other victims upon their forlorn perch.\r\n\r\n"The excitement on the shore increased, and almost the whole population\r\nof the village gathered on the river bank. Lincoln had the log pulled up\r\nthe stream, and, securing another piece of rope, called to the men in\r\nthe tree to catch it if they could when he should reach the tree. He\r\nthen straddled the log himself, and gave the word to push out into the\r\nstream. When he dashed into the tree he threw the rope over the stump of\r\na broken limb, and let it play until he broke the speed of the log, and\r\ngradually drew it back to the tree, holding it there until the three now\r\nnearly frozen men had climbed down and seated themselves astride. He\r\nthen gave orders to the people on shore to hold fast to the end of the\r\nrope which was tied to the log, and leaving his rope in the tree he\r\nturned the log adrift. The force of the current, acting against the taut\r\nrope, swung the log around against the bank and all \'on board\' were\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\n"The excited people who had watched the dangerous expedition with\r\nalternate hope and fear, now broke into cheers for Abe Lincoln, and\r\npraises for his brave act. This adventure made quite a hero of him along\r\nthe Sangamon, and the people never tired of telling of the exploit."\r\n\r\n\r\n"DOWN THE RIVER"\r\n\r\nThe launching of that flatboat was made a feast-day in the neighborhood.\r\nDenton Offutt, its proprietor, was invited to break away from the\r\n"Buckhorn" tavern at Springfield to witness the ceremonies, which, of\r\ncourse, took a political turn. There was much speech-making, but Andrew\r\nJackson and the Whig leaders were equally praised.\r\n\r\nThe boat had been loaded with pork in barrels, corn, and hogs, and it\r\nslid into the Sangamon River, then overflowing with the spring "fresh,"\r\nwith a big splash.\r\n\r\nThe three sturdy navigators, accompanied by Offutt himself, floated away\r\nin triumph from the waving crowd on the bank.\r\n\r\nThe first incident in the voyage occurred the 19th of April, at\r\nRutledge\'s mill dam at New Salem, where the boat stranded and "hung"\r\nthere a day and a night.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ABE GOT THE FLATBOAT OVER THE DAM\r\n\r\nNew Salem was destined to fill an important place in the life of Abraham\r\nLincoln. One who became well acquainted with him described him as the\r\nNew Salemites first saw him, "wading round on Rutledge\'s dam with his\r\ntrousers rolled up nine feet, more or less."\r\n\r\nOne of the crew gave this account of their mode of operations to get the\r\nstranded raft over the dam:\r\n\r\n"We unloaded the boat--that is, we transferred the goods from our boat\r\nto a borrowed one. We then rolled the barrels forward; Lincoln bored a\r\nhole in the end (projecting) over the dam; the water which had leaked in\r\nran out then and we slid over."\r\n\r\nOffutt\'s enthusiasm over Abe\'s simple method of surmounting this great\r\nobstacle was boundless. A crowd had gathered on a hillside to watch\r\nLincoln\'s operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IMPROBABLE PROPHECY\r\n\r\nFor the novelty of the thing, John Hanks claimed to have taken young\r\nLincoln to a "voodoo" negress. She is said to have become excited in\r\nreading the future of the tall, thin young man, saying to him, "You will\r\nbe President, and all the negroes will be free." This story probably\r\noriginated long afterward, when the strange prophecy had already come\r\ntrue--though fortune tellers often inform young men who come to them\r\nthat they will be Presidents some day. That such a woman could read the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation in that young man\'s future is not at all\r\nlikely.\r\n\r\nAnother story is told of Abraham Lincoln\'s second visit to New Orleans\r\nthat is more probable, but even this is not certain to have happened\r\nexactly as related. The young northerner doubtless saw negroes in\r\nchains, and his spirit, like that of his father and mother, rebelled\r\nagainst this inhumanity. There is little doubt that in such sights, as\r\none of his companions related, "Slavery ran the iron into him then and\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n\r\n"I\'LL HIT IT HARD!"\r\n\r\nBut the story goes that the three young fellows--Hanks, Johnston and\r\nLincoln--went wandering about the city, and passed a slave market, where\r\na comely young mulatto girl was offered to the highest bidder. They saw\r\nprospective purchasers examine the weeping girl\'s teeth, pinch her flesh\r\nand pull her about as they would a cow or a horse. The whole scene was\r\nso revolting that Lincoln recoiled from it with horror and hatred,\r\nsaying to his two companions, "Boys, let\'s get away from this. If ever I\r\nget a chance to hit that thing"--meaning slavery--"_I\'ll hit it hard_!"\r\n\r\nIn June the four men took passage up the river on a steamboat for the\r\nreturn trip. At St. Louis, Offutt got off to purchase stock for a store\r\nhe proposed to open in New Salem, where he planned to place young\r\nLincoln in charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRESTLING WITH THE COUNTY CHAMPION\r\n\r\nThe other three started on foot to reach their several homes in\r\nIllinois. Abe improved the opportunity to visit his father\'s family in\r\nColes County, where Thomas Lincoln had removed as soon as he was able\r\nto leave their first Illinois home near Decatur.\r\n\r\nAbe\'s reputation as a wrestler had preceded him and the Coles County\r\nChampion, Daniel Needham, came and challenged the tall visitor to a\r\nfriendly contest. Young Lincoln laughingly accepted and threw Needham\r\ntwice. The crestfallen wrestler\'s pride was deeply hurt, and he found it\r\nhard to give up beaten.\r\n\r\n"Lincoln," said he, "you have thrown me twice, but you can\'t whip me."\r\n\r\nAbe laughed again and replied:\r\n\r\n"Needham, are you satisfied that I can throw you? If you are not, and\r\nmust be convinced through a thrashing, I will do that, too--_for your\r\nsake_!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCLERKING AND WORKING\r\n\r\n\r\nHE COULD "MAKE A FEW RABBIT TRACKS"\r\n\r\nIt was in August, 1831, that Abraham Lincoln appeared in the village of\r\nNew Salem, Illinois. Neither Denton Offutt nor his merchandise had\r\narrived as promised. While paying the penalty of the punctual man--by\r\nwaiting for the tardy one--he seemed to the villagers to be loafing. But\r\nAbraham Lincoln was no loafer. He always found something useful and\r\nhelpful to do. This time there was a local election, and one of the\r\nclerks had not appeared to perform his duties. A New Salem woman wrote\r\nof Lincoln\'s first act in the village:\r\n\r\n"My father, Mentor Graham, was on that day, as usual, appointed to be a\r\nclerk, and Mr. McNamee, who was to be the other, was sick and failed to\r\ncome. They were looking around for a man to fill his place when my\r\nfather noticed Mr. Lincoln and asked if he could write. He answered that\r\nhe could \'make a few rabbit tracks.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\nPILOTING A FAMILY FLATBOAT\r\n\r\nA few days after the election the young stranger, who had become known\r\nby this time as the hero of the flatboat on Rutledge\'s dam four months\r\nbefore, found employment as a pilot. A citizen, Dr. Nelson, was about to\r\nemigrate to Texas. The easiest and best mode of travel in those days\r\nwas by flatboat down the river. He had loaded all his household goods\r\nand movable property on his "private conveyance" and was looking about\r\nfor a "driver." Young Lincoln, still waiting, unemployed, offered his\r\nservices and took the Nelson family down the Sangamon River--a more\r\ndifficult task in August than in April, when the water was high on\r\naccount of the spring rains. But the young pilot proceeded cautiously\r\ndown the shallow stream, and reached Beardstown, on the Illinois River,\r\nwhere he was "discharged" and walked back over the hills to New Salem.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNOYED BY THE HIGH PRAISES OF HIS EMPLOYER\r\n\r\nDenton Offutt and his stock for the store arrived at last, and Lincoln\r\nsoon had a little store opened for business. A country store seemed too\r\nsmall for a clerk of such astounding abilities, so the too enthusiastic\r\nemployer bought Cameron\'s mill with the dam on which Lincoln had already\r\ndistinguished himself, and made the clerk manager of the whole business.\r\n\r\nThis was not enough. Offutt sounded the praises of the new clerk to all\r\ncomers. He claimed that Abraham Lincoln "knew more than any man in the\r\nUnited States." As Mr. Offutt had never shown that he knew enough\r\nhimself to prove this statement, the neighbors began to resent such rash\r\nclaims. In addition, Offutt boasted that Abe could "beat the county"\r\nrunning, jumping and wrestling. Here was something the new clerk could\r\nprove, if true, so his employer\'s statement was promptly challenged.\r\n\r\nWhen a strange man came to the village to live, even though no one\r\nboasted of his prowess, he was likely to suffer at the hands of the\r\nrougher element of the place. It was a sort of rude initiation into\r\ntheir society. These ceremonies were conducted with a savage sense of\r\nhumor by a gang of rowdies known as the "Clary\'s Grove Boys," of whom\r\nthe "best fighter" was Jack Armstrong.\r\n\r\nSometimes "the Boys" nailed up a stranger in a hogshead and it was\r\nrolled down hill. Sometimes he was ingeniously insulted, or made to\r\nfight in self-defense, and beaten black and blue by the whole gang. They\r\nseemed not to be hampered by delicate notions of fair play in their\r\nactions toward a stranger. They "picked on him," as chickens, dogs and\r\nwolves do upon a newcomer among them.\r\n\r\nSo when young Lincoln heard his employer bragging about his brain and\r\nbrawn he was sufficiently acquainted with backwoods nature to know that\r\nit boded no good to him. Even then "he knew how to bide his time," and\r\nturned it to good account, for he had a good chance, shortly to show the\r\nmetal that was in him.\r\n\r\n"The Boys" called and began to banter with the long-legged clerk in the\r\nnew store. This led to a challenge and comparison of strength and\r\nprowess between young Lincoln and Jack Armstrong. Abe accepted the\r\ngauntlet with an alacrity that pleased the crowd, especially the chief\r\nof the bully "Boys," who expected an easy victory. But Jack was\r\nsurprised to find that the stranger was his match--yes, more than his\r\nmatch. Others of "the Boys" saw this, also, and began to interfere by\r\ntripping Abe and trying to help their champion by unfair means.\r\n\r\nThis made young Lincoln angry. Putting forth all his strength, he seized\r\nArmstrong by the throat and "nearly choked the exuberant life out of\r\nhim." When "the Boys" saw the stranger shaking their "best fighter" as\r\nif he were a mere child, their enmity gave place to admiration; and when\r\nAbe had thrown Jack Armstrong upon the ground, in his wrath, as a lion\r\nwould throw a dog that had been set upon him, and while the strong\r\nstranger stood there, with his back to the wall, challenging the whole\r\ngang, with deep-set eyes blazing with indignation, they acknowledged him\r\nas their conqueror, and declared that "Abe Lincoln is the cleverest\r\nfellow that ever broke into the settlement."\r\n\r\nThe initiation was over, and young Lincoln\'s triumph complete. From that\r\nday "the Clary\'s Grove Boys" were his staunch supporters and defenders,\r\nand his employer was allowed to go on bragging about his wonderful clerk\r\nwithout hindrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIVING ANOTHER BULLY "A DOSE OF SMARTWEED"\r\n\r\nA bumptious stranger came into the store one day and tried to pick a\r\nquarrel with the tall clerk. To this end he used language offensive to\r\nseveral women who were there trading. Lincoln quietly asked the fellow\r\nto desist as there were "ladies present." The bully considered this an\r\nadmission that the clerk was afraid of him, so he began to swear and use\r\nmore offensive language than before. As this was too much for Abraham\'s\r\npatience, he whispered to the fellow that if he would keep quiet till\r\nthe ladies went out, he (Lincoln) would go and "have it out."\r\n\r\nAfter the women went, the man became violently abusive. Young Lincoln\r\ncalmly went outside with him, saying: "I see you must be whipped and I\r\nsuppose I will have to do it." With this he seized the insolent fellow\r\nand made short work of him. Throwing the man on the ground, Lincoln sat\r\non him, and, with his long arms, gathered a handful of "smartweed" which\r\ngrew around them. He then rubbed it into the bully\'s eyes until he\r\nroared with pain. An observer of this incident said afterward:\r\n\r\n"Lincoln did all this without a particle of anger, and when the job was\r\nfinished he went immediately for water, washed his victim\'s face and did\r\neverything he could to alleviate the man\'s distress. The upshot of the\r\nmatter was that the fellow became his life-long friend, and was a better\r\nman from that day."\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW HE MADE HIS FELLOW CLERK GIVE UP GAMBLING\r\n\r\nLincoln\'s morals were unusually good for that time and place. Smoking,\r\nchewing, drinking, swearing and gambling were almost universal among\r\nhis associates. Offutt hired a young man, William G. Greene, after the\r\npurchase of the mill. This assistant first told many of the stories, now\r\nso well known, concerning Abe at this period of his career:\r\n\r\nYoung Greene was, like most of the young men in New Salem, addicted to\r\npetty gambling. He once related how Lincoln induced him to quit the\r\nhabit. Abe said to him one day:\r\n\r\n"Billy, you ought to stop gambling with Estep." Billy made a lame\r\nexcuse:\r\n\r\n"I\'m ninety cents behind, and I can\'t quit until I win it back."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll help you get that back," urged Lincoln, "if you\'ll promise me you\r\nwon\'t gamble any more."\r\n\r\nThe youth reflected a moment and made the required promise. Lincoln\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n"Here are some good hats, and you need a new one. Now, when Estep comes\r\nagain, you draw him on by degrees, and finally bet him one of these hats\r\nthat I can lift a forty-gallon barrel of whisky and take a drink out of\r\nthe bunghole."\r\n\r\nBilly agreed, and the two clerks chuckled as they fixed the barrel so\r\nthat the bunghole would come in the right place to win the bet, though\r\nthe thing seemed impossible to Greene himself. Estep appeared in due\r\ntime, and after long parleying and bantering the wager was laid. Lincoln\r\nthen squatted before the barrel, lifted one end up on one knee, then\r\nraised the other end on to the other knee, bent over, and by a Herculean\r\neffort, actually succeeded in taking a drink from the bunghole--though\r\nhe spat it out immediately. "That was the only time," said Greene long\r\nafterward, "that I ever saw Abraham Lincoln take a drink of liquor of\r\nany kind." This was the more remarkable, as whisky was served on all\r\noccasions--even passed around with refreshments at religious meetings,\r\naccording to Mrs. Josiah Crawford, the woman for whom Abe and Nancy had\r\nworked as hired help. Much as Abe disapproved of drinking, he considered\r\nthat "the end justified the means" employed to break his fellow clerk of\r\nthe gambling habit.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW HE WON THE NAME OF "HONEST ABE"\r\n\r\nAbe Lincoln could not endure the thought of cheating any one, even\r\nthough it had been done unintentionally. One day a woman bought a bill\r\nof goods in Offutt\'s store amounting to something over two dollars. She\r\npaid Abe the money and went away satisfied. That night, on going over\r\nthe sales of the day, Abe found that he had charged the woman six and\r\none-fourth cents too much. After closing the store, though it was late,\r\nhe could not go home to supper or to bed till he had restored that\r\nsixpence to its proper owner. She lived more than two miles away, but\r\nthat did not matter to Abe Lincoln. When he had returned the money to\r\nthe astonished woman he walked back to the village with a long step and\r\na light heart, content with doing his duty.\r\n\r\nAnother evening, as he was closing the store, a woman came in for a\r\nhalf-pound of tea. He weighed it out for her and took the pay. But early\r\nnext morning, when he came to "open up," he found the four-ounce weight\r\ninstead of the eight-ounce on the scales, and inferred that he had given\r\nthat woman only half as much tea as he had taken the money for. Of\r\ncourse, the woman would never know the difference, and it meant walking\r\nseveral miles and back, but the honest clerk weighed out another quarter\r\npound of tea, locked the store and took that long walk before breakfast.\r\nAs a "constitutional" it must have been a benefit to his health, for it\r\nsatisfied his sensitive conscience and soothed his tender heart to "make\r\ngood" in that way.\r\n\r\nDrink and misdirected enthusiasm interfered with Denton Offutt\'s\r\nsuccess. After about a year in New Salem he "busted up," as the\r\nneighbors expressed it, and left his creditors in the lurch. Among them\r\nwas the clerk he had boasted so much about. For a short time Abe Lincoln\r\nneeded a home, and found a hearty welcome with Jack Armstrong, the best\r\nfighter of Clary\'s Grove!\r\n\r\nJ. G. Holland wrote, in his "Life of Abraham Lincoln," of the young\r\nman\'s progress during his first year in New Salem:\r\n\r\n"The year that Lincoln was in Denton Offutt\'s store was one of great\r\nadvance. He had made new and valuable acquaintances, read many books,\r\nwon multitudes of friends, and become ready for a step further in\r\nadvance. Those who could appreciate brains respected him, and those\r\nwhose ideas of a man related to his muscles were devoted to him. It was\r\nwhile he was performing the work of the store that he acquired the\r\nnickname, \'Honest Abe\'--a characterization that he never dishonored, an\r\nabbreviation that he never outgrew. He was everybody\'s friend, the\r\nbest-natured, the most sensible, the best-informed, the most modest and\r\nunassuming, the kindest, gentlest, roughest, strongest, best fellow in\r\nall New Salem and the region round about."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPOLITICS, WAR, STOREKEEPING AND STUDYING LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDYING GRAMMAR FIRST\r\n\r\nBy "a step still further in advance" Dr. Holland must have meant the\r\nyoung clerk\'s going into politics. He had made many friends in New\r\nSalem, and they reflected back his good-will by urging him to run for\r\nthe State Legislature. Before doing this he consulted Mentor Graham, the\r\nvillage schoolmaster, with whom he had worked as election clerk when he\r\nfirst came to the place. Abe could read, write and cipher, but he felt\r\nthat if he should succeed in politics, he would disgrace his office and\r\nhimself by not speaking and writing English correctly.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster advised: "If you expect to go before the public in any\r\ncapacity, I think the best thing you can do is to study English\r\ngrammar."\r\n\r\n"If I had a grammar I would commence now," sighed Abe.\r\n\r\nMr. Graham thought one could be found at Vaner\'s, only six miles away.\r\nSo Abe got up and started for it as fast as he could stride. In an\r\nincredibly short time he returned with a copy of Kirkham\'s Grammar, and\r\nset to work upon it at once. Sometimes he would steal away into the\r\nwoods, where he could study "out loud" if he desired. He kept up his old\r\nhabit of sitting up nights to read, and as lights were expensive, the\r\nvillage cooper allowed him to stay in his shop, where he burned the\r\nshavings and studied by the blaze as he had done in Indiana, after every\r\none else had gone to bed. So it was not long before young Lincoln, with\r\nthe aid of Schoolmaster Graham, had mastered the principles of English\r\ngrammar, and felt himself better equipped to enter politics and public\r\nlife. Some of his rivals, however, did not trouble themselves about\r\nspeaking and writing correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOING INTO POLITICS\r\n\r\nJames Rutledge, a "substantial" citizen, and the former owner of\r\nRutledge\'s mill and dam, was the president of the New Salem debating\r\nclub. Young Lincoln joined this society, and when he first rose to\r\nspeak, everybody began to smile in anticipation of a funny story, but\r\nAbe proceeded to discuss the question before the house in very good\r\nform. He was awkward in his movements and gestures at first, and amused\r\nthose present by thrusting his unwieldy hands deep into his pockets, but\r\nhis arguments were so well-put and forcible that all who heard him were\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\nMr. Rutledge, that night after Abe\'s maiden effort at the lyceum, told\r\nhis wife:\r\n\r\n"There is more in Abe Lincoln\'s head than mere wit and fun. He is\r\nalready a fine speaker. All he needs is culture to fit him for a high\r\nposition in public life."\r\n\r\nBut there were occasions enough where something besides culture was\r\nrequired. A man who was present and heard Lincoln\'s first real stump\r\nspeech describes his appearance and actions in the following picturesque\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n"He wore a mixed jean coat, clawhammer style, short in the sleeves and\r\nbob-tail--in fact, it was so short in the tail that he could not sit\r\nupon it--flax and tow linen pantaloons, and a straw hat. I think he wore\r\na vest, but do not remember how it looked. He wore pot metal (top)\r\nboots.\r\n\r\n"His maiden effort on the stump was a speech on the occasion of a public\r\nsale at Pappyville, a village eleven miles from Springfield. After the\r\nsale was over and speechmaking had begun, a fight--a \'general fight\' as\r\none of the bystanders relates--ensued, and Lincoln, noticing one of his\r\nfriends about to succumb to the attack of an infuriated ruffian,\r\ninterposed to prevent it. He did so most effectually. Hastily descending\r\nfrom the rude platform, he edged his way through the crowd, and seizing\r\nthe bully by the neck and the seat of his trousers, threw him by means\r\nof his great strength and long arms, as one witness stoutly insists,\r\n\'twelve feet away.\' Returning to the stand, and throwing aside his hat,\r\nhe inaugurated his campaign with the following brief and juicy\r\ndeclaration:\r\n\r\n"\'Fellow-Citizens: I presume you all know who I am. I am humble Abraham\r\nLincoln. I have been solicited by many friends to become a candidate\r\nfor the Legislature. My politics are "short and sweet" like the old\r\nwoman\'s dance. I am in favor of national bank. I am in favor of the\r\ninternal improvement system, and a high protective tariff. These are my\r\nsentiments and political principles. If elected, I shall be thankful; if\r\nnot, it will be all the same.\'"\r\n\r\nThe only requirement for a candidate for the Illinois Legislature in\r\n1832 was that he should announce his "sentiments." This Lincoln did,\r\naccording to custom, in a circular of about two thousand words,\r\nrehearsing his experiences on the Sangamon River and in the community of\r\nNew Salem. For a youth who had just turned twenty-three, who had never\r\nbeen to school a year in his life, who had no political training, and\r\nhad never made a political speech, it was a bold and dignified document,\r\nclosing as follows:\r\n\r\n"Considering the great degree of modesty which should always attend\r\nyouth, it is probable I have already been presuming more than becomes\r\nme. However, upon the subjects of which I have treated, I have spoken as\r\nI have thought. I may be wrong in regard to any or all of them, but,\r\nholding it a sound maxim that it is better only sometimes to be right\r\nthan at all times to be wrong, so soon as I discover my opinions to be\r\nerroneous, I shall be ready to renounce them.\r\n\r\n"Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether this is true\r\nor not, I can say for one, that I have no other so great as that of\r\nbeing truly esteemed of my fellow-men by rendering myself worthy of\r\ntheir esteem. How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet\r\nto be developed. I am young and unknown to many of you. I was born, and\r\nhave ever remained in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy\r\nor popular relations or friends to recommend me. My case is thrown\r\nexclusively upon the independent voters of the country; and, if elected,\r\nthey will have conferred a favor on me for which I shall be unremitting\r\nin my labors to compensate. But if the good people in their wisdom shall\r\nsee fit to keep me in the background, I have been too familiar with\r\ndisappointments to be very much chagrined."\r\n\r\n\r\n"CAPTAIN LINCOLN"\r\n\r\nLincoln had hardly launched in his first political venture when, in\r\nApril, 1832, a messenger arrived in New Salem with the announcement from\r\nGovernor Reynolds, of Illinois, that the Sacs and other hostile tribes,\r\nled by Black Hawk, had invaded the northern part of the State, spreading\r\nterror among the white settlers in that region. The governor called upon\r\nthose who were willing to help in driving back the Indians to report at\r\nBeardstown, on the Illinois River, within a week.\r\n\r\nLincoln and other Sangamon County men went at once to Richmond where a\r\ncompany was formed. The principal candidate for captain was a man named\r\nKirkpatrick, who had treated Lincoln shabbily when Abe, in one of the\r\nodd jobs he had done in that region, worked in Kirkpatrick\'s sawmill.\r\nThe employer had agreed to buy his hired man a cant-hook for handling\r\nthe heavy logs. As there was a delay in doing this, Lincoln told him he\r\nwould handle the logs without the cant-hook if Kirkpatrick would pay him\r\nthe two dollars that implement would cost. The employer promised to do\r\nthis, but never gave him the money.\r\n\r\nSo when Lincoln saw that Kirkpatrick was a candidate for the captaincy,\r\nhe said to Greene, who had worked with him in Offutt\'s store:\r\n\r\n"Bill, I believe I can make Kirkpatrick pay me that two dollars he owes\r\nme on the cant-hook now. I guess I\'ll run against him for captain."\r\n\r\nTherefore Abe Lincoln announced himself as a candidate. The vote was\r\ntaken in an odd way. It was announced that when the men heard the\r\ncommand to march, each should go and stand by the man he wished to have\r\nfor captain. The command was given. At the word, "March," three-fourths\r\nof the company rallied round Abe Lincoln. More than twenty-five years\r\nafterward, when Lincoln was a candidate for the presidency of the United\r\nStates, he referred to himself in the third person in describing this\r\nincident, saying that he was elected "to his own surprise," and "he says\r\nhe has not since had any success in life which gave him so much\r\nsatisfaction."\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNORANCE OF MILITARY TACTICS\r\n\r\nBut Lincoln was a "raw hand" at military tactics. He used to enjoy\r\ntelling of his ignorance and the expedients adopted in giving his\r\ncommands to the company. Once when he was marching, twenty men abreast,\r\nacross a field it became necessary to pass through a narrow gateway into\r\nthe next field. He said:\r\n\r\n"I could not, for the life of me, remember the word for getting the\r\ncompany _endwise_ so that it could go through the gate; so, as we came\r\nnear the gate, I shouted, \'This company is dismissed for two minutes,\r\nwhen it will fall in again on the other side of the fence.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\nA HISTORIC MYSTERY EXPLAINED\r\n\r\nCaptain Lincoln had his sword taken from him for shooting within limits.\r\nMany have wondered that a man of Lincoln\'s intelligence should have been\r\nguilty of this stupid infraction of ordinary army regulations.\r\nBiographers of Lincoln puzzled over this until the secret was explained\r\nby William Turley Baker, of Bolivia, Ill., at the Lincoln Centenary in\r\nSpringfield. All unconscious of solving a historic mystery, "Uncle\r\nBilly" Baker related the following story which explains that the\r\nshooting was purely accidental:\r\n\r\n"My father was roadmaster general in the Black Hawk War. Lincoln used to\r\ncome often to our house and talk it all over with father, when I was a\r\nboy, and I\'ve heard them laugh over their experiences in that war. The\r\nbest joke of all was this: Father received orders one day to throw log\r\nbridges over a certain stream the army had to cross. He felled some\r\ntall, slim black walnuts--the only ones he could find there--and the\r\nlogs were so smooth and round that they were hard to walk on any time.\r\nThis day it rained and made them very slippery. Half of the soldiers\r\nfell into the stream and got a good ducking. Captain Lincoln was one of\r\nthose that tumbled in. He just laughed and scrambled out as quick as he\r\ncould. He always made the best of everything like that.\r\n\r\n"Well, that evening when the company came to camp, some of them had dog\r\ntents--just a big canvas sheet--and the boys laughed to see Lincoln\r\ncrawl under one of them little tents. He was so long that his head and\r\nhands and feet stuck out on all sides. The boys said he looked just like\r\na big terrapin. After he had got himself stowed away for the night, he\r\nremembered that he hadn\'t cleaned his pistol, after he fell into the\r\ncreek.\r\n\r\n"So he backed out from under his canvas shell and started to clean it\r\nout. It was what was called a bulldog pistol, because it had a blunt,\r\nshort muzzle. Abe\'s forefinger was long enough to use as a ramrod for\r\nit. But before he began operations he snapped the trigger and, to his\r\nastonishment, the thing went off!\r\n\r\n"Pretty soon an orderly came along in great haste, yellin\', \'Who did\r\nthat?--Who fired that shot?\' Some of the men tried to send the orderly\r\nalong about his business, making believe the report was heard further\r\non, but Lincoln he wouldn\'t stand for no such deception, spoken or\r\nunspoken. \'I did it,\' says he, beginning to explain how it happened.\r\n\r\n"You see, his legs was so blamed long, and he must have landed on his\r\nfeet, in the creek, and got out of the water without his pistol getting\r\nwet, \'way up there in his weskit!\r\n\r\n"But he had to pay the penalty just the same, for they took his sword\r\naway from him for several days. You see, he was a captain and ought to\r\n\'a\' set a good example in military discipline."\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW CAPTAIN LINCOLN SAVED AN INDIAN\'S LIFE\r\n\r\nOne day an old "friendly Indian" came into camp with a "talking paper"\r\nor pass from the "big white war chief." The men, with the pioneer idea\r\nthat "the only good Indian is a dead Indian," were for stringing him up.\r\nThe poor old red man protested and held the general\'s letter before\r\ntheir eyes.\r\n\r\n"Me good Injun," he kept saying, "white war chief say me good Injun.\r\nLook--talking paper--see!"\r\n\r\n"Get out! It\'s a forgery! Shoot him! String him up!" shouted the\r\nsoldiers angrily.\r\n\r\nThis noise brought Captain Lincoln out of his tent. At a glance he saw\r\nwhat they were about to do. He jumped in among them, shouting\r\nindignantly:\r\n\r\n"Stand back, all of you! For shame! I\'ll fight you all, one after the\r\nother, just as you come. Take it out on me if you can, but you shan\'t\r\nhurt this poor old Indian. When a man comes to me for help, he\'s going\r\nto get it, if I have to lick all Sangamon County to give it to him."\r\n\r\nThe three months for which the men were enlisted soon expired, and\r\nLincoln\'s captaincy also ended. But he re-enlisted as a private, and\r\nremained in the ranks until the end of the war, which found him in\r\nWisconsin, hundreds of miles from New Salem. He and a few companions\r\nwalked home, as there were not many horses to be had. Lincoln enlivened\r\nthe long tramp with his fund of stories and jokes.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes asserted that Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis met at\r\nthis early day, as officers in the Black Hawk War, but this statement\r\nis not founded on fact, for young Lieutenant Davis was absent on a\r\nfurlough and could not have encountered the tall captain from the\r\nSangamon then, as many would like to believe.\r\n\r\nLincoln always referred to the Black Hawk War as a humorous adventure.\r\nHe made a funny speech in Congress describing some of his experiences in\r\nthis campaign in which he did not take part in a battle, nor did he even\r\ncatch sight of a hostile Indian.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGAIN A RIVER PILOT\r\n\r\nAbe was still out of work. Just before he enlisted he piloted the\r\n_Talisman_, a steamboat which had come up the Sangamon on a trial trip,\r\nin which the speed of the boat averaged four miles an hour. At that time\r\nthe wildest excitement prevailed. The coming of the _Talisman_ up their\r\nlittle river was hailed with grand demonstrations and much\r\nspeech-making. Every one expected the Government to spend millions of\r\ndollars to make the Sangamon navigable, and even New Salem (which is not\r\nnow to be found on the map) was to become a flourishing city, in the\r\nhopeful imaginings of its few inhabitants. Lincoln, being a candidate,\r\nnaturally "took the fever," and shared the delirium that prevailed. He\r\ncould hardly have done otherwise, even if he had been so disposed. This\r\nwas before the days of railroads, and the commerce and prosperity of the\r\ncountry depended on making the smaller streams navigable. Lincoln\r\nreceived forty dollars, however, for his services as pilot. The\r\n_Talisman_, instead of establishing a river connection with the\r\nMississippi River cities, never came back. She was burned at the wharf\r\nin St. Louis, and the navigation of the poor little Sangamon, which was\r\nonly a shallow creek, was soon forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN\'S ONLY DEFEAT BY A DIRECT VOTE\r\n\r\nWhen Abe returned from the war he had no steady employment. On this\r\naccount, especially, he must have been deeply disappointed to be\r\ndefeated in the election which took place within two weeks after his\r\narrival. His patriotism had been stronger than his political sagacity.\r\nIf he had stayed at home to help himself to the Legislature he might\r\nhave been elected, though he was then a comparative stranger in the\r\ncounty. One of the four representatives chosen was Peter Cartwright, the\r\nbackwoods preacher.\r\n\r\nLincoln afterward mentioned that this was the only time he was ever\r\ndefeated by a direct vote of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nBUYING AND KEEPING A STORE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter making what he considered a bad beginning politically, young\r\nLincoln was on the lookout for a "business chance." One came to him in a\r\npeculiar way. A man named Radford had opened a store in New Salem.\r\nPossessing neither the strength nor the sagacity and tact of Abe\r\nLincoln, he was driven out of business by the Clary\'s Grove Boys, who\r\nbroke his store fixtures and drank his liquors. In his fright Radford\r\nwas willing to sell out at almost any price and take most of his pay in\r\npromissory notes. He was quickly accommodated. Through William G. Greene\r\na transfer was made at once from Reuben Radford to William Berry and\r\nAbraham Lincoln. Berry had $250 in cash and made the first payment. In a\r\nfew hours after a violent visit from those ruffians from Clary\'s Grove\r\nBerry and Lincoln had formed a partnership and were the nominal owners\r\nof a country store.\r\n\r\nThe new firm soon absorbed the stock and business of another firm, James\r\nand Rowan Herndon, who had previously acquired the stock and debts of\r\nthe predecessors in their business, and all these obligations were\r\npassed on with the goods of both the Radford and Herndon stores to\r\n"Honest Abe."\r\n\r\nThe senior partner of the firm of Berry & Lincoln was devoted to the\r\nwhisky which was found in the inventory of the Radford stock, and the\r\njunior partner was given over to the study of a set of "Blackstone\'s\r\nCommentaries," text-books which all lawyers have to study, that came\r\ninto his possession in a peculiar way, as Candidate Lincoln told an\r\nartist who was painting his portrait in 1860:\r\n\r\n"One day a man who was migrating to the West drove up in front of my\r\nstore with a wagon which contained his family and household plunder. He\r\nasked me if I would buy an old barrel for which he had no room in his\r\nwagon, and which contained nothing of special value. I did not want it,\r\nbut to oblige him I bought it, and paid him, I think, half a dollar for\r\nit. Without further examination I put it away in the store and forgot\r\nall about it.\r\n\r\n"Some time after, in overhauling things, I came upon the barrel, and\r\nemptying it on the floor to see what it contained, I found at the bottom\r\nof the rubbish a complete set of \'Blackstone\'s Commentaries.\' I began to\r\nread those famous works. I had plenty of time; for during the long\r\nsummer days, when the farmers were busy with their crops, my customers\r\nwere few and far between. The more I read the more intensely interested\r\nI became. Never in my whole life was my mind so thoroughly absorbed. I\r\nread until I devoured them."\r\n\r\nWith one partner drinking whisky and the other devouring "Blackstone,"\r\nit was not surprising that the business "winked out," as Lincoln\r\nwhimsically expressed it, leaving the conscientious junior partner\r\nsaddled with the obligations of the former owners of two country stores,\r\nand owing an amount so large that Lincoln often referred to it as "the\r\nnational debt." William Berry, the senior partner, who was equally\r\nresponsible, "drank himself to death," leaving Lincoln alone to pay all\r\nthe debts.\r\n\r\nAccording to the custom and conscience of the time, the insolvent young\r\nmerchant was under no obligation whatever to pay liabilities contracted\r\nby the other men, but Lincoln could never be induced even to compromise\r\nany of the accounts the others had gone off and left him to settle.\r\n"Honest Abe" paid the last cent of his "national debt" nearly twenty\r\nyears later, after much toil, self-denial and hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTMASTER LINCOLN AND JACK ARMSTRONG\'S FAMILY\r\n\r\nAgain out of employment, Abe was forced to accept the hospitality of his\r\nfriends of whom he now had a large number. While in business with Berry\r\nhe received the appointment as postmaster. The pay of the New Salem post\r\noffice was not large, but Lincoln, always longing for news and\r\nknowledge, had the privilege of reading the newspapers which passed\r\nthrough his hands. He took so much pains in delivering the letters and\r\npapers that came into his charge as postmaster that he anticipated the\r\n"special delivery" and "rural free delivery" features of the postal\r\nservice of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n"A. LINCOLN, DEPUTY SURVEYOR"\r\n\r\nLater John Calhoun, the county surveyor, sent word to Lincoln that he\r\nwould appoint him deputy surveyor of the county if he would accept the\r\nposition. The young man, greatly astonished, went to Springfield to call\r\non Calhoun and see if the story could be true. Calhoun knew that Lincoln\r\nwas utterly ignorant of surveying, but told him he might take time to\r\nstudy up. As soon as Lincoln was assured that the appointment did not\r\ninvolve any political obligation--for Calhoun was a Jackson Democrat,\r\nand Lincoln was already a staunch Whig--he procured a copy of Flint and\r\nGibson\'s "Surveying" and went to work with a will. With the aid of\r\nMentor Graham, and studying day and night, he mastered the subject and\r\nreported to Calhoun in six weeks. The county surveyor was astounded, but\r\nwhen Lincoln gave ample proofs of his ability to do field work, the\r\nchief surveyor appointed him a deputy and assigned him to the northern\r\npart of Sangamon County.\r\n\r\nDeputy Surveyor Lincoln had to run deeper in debt for a horse and\r\nsurveying instruments in order to do this new work. Although he made\r\nthree dollars a day at it--a large salary for that time--and board and\r\nexpenses were cheap, he was unable to make money fast enough to satisfy\r\none creditor who was pushing him to pay one of the old debts left by the\r\nfailure of Berry & Lincoln. This man sued Lincoln and, getting judgment,\r\nseized the deputy\'s horse and instruments. This was like "killing the\r\ngoose that laid the golden egg." Lincoln was in despair. But a friend,\r\nas a surprise, bought in the horse and instruments for one hundred and\r\ntwenty dollars and presented them to the struggling surveyor.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, many years afterward, generously repaid this man,\r\n"Uncle Jimmy" Short, for his friendly act in that hour of need.\r\n\r\nLincoln\'s reputation as a story teller and wrestler had spread so that\r\nwhen it became known that he was to survey a tract in a certain district\r\nthe whole neighborhood turned out and held a sort of picnic. Men and\r\nboys stood ready to "carry chain," drive stakes, blaze trees, or work\r\nfor the popular deputy in any capacity--just to hear his funny stories\r\nand odd jokes. They had foot races, wrestling matches and other\r\nathletic sports, in which the surveyor sometimes took part.\r\n\r\nBut Lincoln\'s honesty was as manifest in "running his lines" as in his\r\nweights and measures while he was a clerk and storekeeper. In whatever\r\nhe attempted he did his best. He had that true genius, which is defined\r\nas "the ability to take pains." With all his jokes and fun Abraham\r\nLincoln was deeply in earnest. Careless work in making surveys involved\r\nthe landholders of that part of the country in endless disputes and\r\ngoing to law about boundaries. But Lincoln\'s surveys were recognized as\r\ncorrect always, so that, although he had mastered the science in six\r\nweeks, lawyers and courts had such confidence in his skill, as well as\r\nhis honesty, that his record as to a certain corner or line was accepted\r\nas the true verdict and that ended the dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE\r\n\r\nHampered though he was by unjust debts and unreasonable creditors,\r\nPostmaster and Surveyor Lincoln gained an honorable reputation\r\nthroughout the county, so that when he ran for the State Legislature,\r\nin 1834, he was elected by a creditable majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG LEGISLATOR IN LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOOT\'S RESPONSIBILITY\r\n\r\nPaying his debts had kept Lincoln so poor that, though he had been\r\nelected to the Legislature, he was not properly clothed or equipped to\r\nmake himself presentable as the people\'s representative at the State\r\ncapital, then located at Vandalia. One day he went with a friend to call\r\non an older acquaintance, named Smoot, who was almost as dry a joker as\r\nhimself, but Smoot had more of this world\'s goods than the young\r\nlegislator-elect. Lincoln began at once to chaff his friend.\r\n\r\n"Smoot," said he, "did you vote for me?"\r\n\r\n"I did that very thing," answered Smoot.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Lincoln with a wink, "that makes you responsible. You must\r\nlend me the money to buy suitable clothing, for I want to make a decent\r\nappearance in the Legislature."\r\n\r\n"How much do you want?" asked Smoot.\r\n\r\n"About two hundred dollars, I reckon."\r\n\r\nFor friendship\'s sake and for the honor of Sangamon County the young\r\nrepresentative received the money at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nANN RUTLEDGE--"LOVED AND LOST"\r\n\r\nAbe Lincoln\'s new suit of clothes made him look still more handsome in\r\nthe eyes of Ann, the daughter of the proprietor of Rutledge\'s Tavern,\r\nwhere Abe was boarding at that time. She was a beautiful girl who had\r\nbeen betrothed to a young man named McNamar, who was said to have\r\nreturned to New York State to care for his dying father and look after\r\nthe family estate. It began to leak out that this young man was going\r\nabout under an assumed name and certain suspicious circumstances came to\r\nlight. But Ann, though she loved the young legislator, still clung to\r\nher promise and the man who had proved false to her. As time went on,\r\nthough she was supposed to be betrothed to Mr. Lincoln, the treatment\r\nshe had received from the recreant lover preyed upon her mind so that\r\nshe fell into a decline in the summer of 1835, about a year after her\r\ntrue lover\'s election to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nWilliam O. Stoddard, one of the President\'s private secretaries, has\r\nbest told the story of the young lover\'s despair over the loss of his\r\nfirst love:\r\n\r\n"It is not known precisely when Ann Rutledge told her suitor that her\r\nheart was his, but early in 1835 it was publicly known that they were\r\nsolemnly betrothed. Even then the scrupulous maiden waited for the\r\nreturn of the absent McNamar, that she might be formally released from\r\nthe obligation to him which he had so recklessly forfeited. Her friends\r\nargued with her that she was carrying her scruples too far, and at last,\r\nas neither man nor letter came, she permitted it to be understood that\r\nshe would marry Abraham Lincoln as soon as his legal studies should be\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n"That was a glorious summer for him; the brightest, sweetest, most\r\nhopeful he yet had known. It was also the fairest time he was ever to\r\nsee; for even now, as the golden days came and went, they brought an\r\nincreasing shadow on their wings. It was a shadow that was not to pass\r\naway. Little by little came indications that the health of Ann Rutledge\r\nhad suffered under the prolonged strain to which she had been subjected.\r\nHer sensitive nature had been strung to too high a tension and the\r\nchords of her life were beginning to give way.\r\n\r\n"There were those of her friends who said that she died of a broken\r\nheart, but the doctors called it \'brain fever.\'\r\n\r\n"On the 25th of August, 1835, just before the summer died, she passed\r\naway from earth. But she never faded from the heart of Abraham\r\nLincoln. . . . In her early grave was buried the best hope he ever knew,\r\nand the shadow of that great darkness was never entirely lifted from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"A few days before Ann\'s death a message from her brought her betrothed\r\nto her bedside, and they were left alone. No one ever knew what passed\r\nbetween them in the endless moments of that last sad farewell; but\r\nLincoln left the house with inexpressible agony written upon his face.\r\nHe had been to that hour a man of marvelous poise and self-control, but\r\nthe pain he now struggled with grew deeper and more deep, until, when\r\nthey came and told him she was dead, his heart and will, and even his\r\nbrain itself gave way. He was utterly without help or the knowledge of\r\npossible help in this world or beyond it. He was frantic for a time,\r\nseeming even to lose the sense of his own identity, and all New Salem\r\nsaid that he was insane. He piteously moaned and raved:\r\n\r\n"\'I never can be reconciled to have the snow, rain, and storms beat upon\r\nher grave.\'\r\n\r\n"His best friends seemed to have lost their influence over him, . . . all\r\nbut one; for Bowling Green . . . managed to entice the poor fellow to his\r\nown home, a short distance from the village, there to keep watch and\r\nward over him until the fury of his sorrow should wear away. There were\r\nwell-grounded fears lest he might do himself some injury, and the watch\r\nwas vigilantly kept.\r\n\r\n"In a few weeks reason again obtained the mastery, and it was safe to\r\nlet him return to his studies and his work. He could indeed work again,\r\nand he could once more study law, for there was a kind of relief in\r\nsteady occupation and absorbing toil, but he was not, could not ever be\r\nthe same man. . . .\r\n\r\n"Lincoln had been fond of poetry from boyhood, and had gradually made\r\nhimself familiar with large parts of Shakespeare\'s plays and the works\r\nof other great writers. He now discovered, in a strange collection of\r\nverses, the one poem which seemed best to express the morbid, troubled,\r\nsore condition of his mind, . . . the lines by William Knox, beginning:\r\n\r\n        "\'Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?\r\n         Like a swift fleeting meteor, a fast flying cloud,\r\n         A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,\r\n         He passeth from life to his rest in the grave:\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n"THE LONG NINE" AND THE REMOVAL TO SPRINGFIELD\r\n\r\nTwo years was the term for which Lincoln was elected to the Legislature.\r\nThe year following the death of Ann Rutledge he threw himself into a\r\nvigorous campaign for re-election. He had found much to do at Vandalia.\r\nThe greatest thing was the proposed removal of the State capital to\r\nSpringfield. In this enterprise he had the co-operation of a group of\r\ntall men, known as "the Long Nine," of whom he was the tallest and came\r\nto be the leader.\r\n\r\nLincoln announced his second candidacy in this brief, informal letter in\r\nthe county paper:\r\n\r\n\r\n                            "NEW SALEM, June 13, 1836.\r\n\r\n        "TO THE EDITOR OR THE JOURNAL:\r\n\r\n        "In your paper of last Saturday I see a\r\n        communication over the signature of \'Many\r\n        Voters\' in which the candidates who are\r\n        announced in the _Journal_ are called upon to\r\n        \'show their hands.\'\r\n\r\n        "Agreed. Here\'s mine:\r\n\r\n        "I go in for all sharing the privileges of the\r\n        government who assist in bearing its burdens.\r\n        Consequently, I go for admitting all whites to\r\n        the right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear\r\n        arms (by no means excluding females).\r\n\r\n        "If elected, I shall consider the whole people\r\n        of Sangamon my constituents, as well those that\r\n        oppose as those that support me.\r\n\r\n        "While acting as their Representative, I shall\r\n        be governed by their will on all subjects upon\r\n        which I have the means of knowing what their\r\n        will is; and upon all others I shall do what my\r\n        own judgment teaches me will best advance\r\n        their interests. Whether elected or not, I go\r\n        for distributing the proceeds of public lands\r\n        to the several States to enable our State, in\r\n        common with others, to dig canals and construct\r\n        railroads without borrowing and paying interest\r\n        on it.\r\n\r\n        "If alive on the first Monday in November, I\r\n        shall vote for Hugh L. White for President.\r\n\r\n                            "Very respectfully,\r\n                                       "A. LINCOLN."\r\n\r\nThe earliest railroads in the United States had been built during the\r\nfive years just preceding this announcement, the first one of all, only\r\nthirteen miles long, near Baltimore, in 1831. It is interesting to\r\nobserve the enthusiasm with which the young frontier politician caught\r\nthe progressive idea, and how quickly the minds of the people turned\r\nfrom impossible river "improvements" to the grand possibilities of\r\nrailway transportation.\r\n\r\nMany are the stories of the remarkable Sangamon campaign in 1836. Rowan\r\nHerndon, Abe\'s fellow pilot and storekeeper, told the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nWINNING VOTES, WIELDING THE "CRADLE" IN A WHEAT FIELD\r\n\r\n"Abraham came to my house, near Island Grove, during harvest. There were\r\nsome thirty men in the field. He got his dinner and went out into the\r\nfield, where the men were at work. I gave him an introduction, and the\r\nboys said that they could not vote for a man unless he could take a\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"\'Well, boys,\' said he, \'if that is all, I am sure of your votes\' He\r\ntook the \'cradle\' and led all the way round with perfect ease. The boys\r\nwere satisfied, and I don\'t think he lost a vote in the crowd.\r\n\r\n"The next day there was speaking at Berlin. He went from my house with\r\nDr. Barnett, who had asked me who this man Lincoln was. I told him that\r\nhe was a candidate for the Legislature. He laughed and said:\r\n\r\n"\'Can\'t the party raise any better material than that?\'\r\n\r\n"I said, \'Go to-morrow and hear him before you pronounce judgment.\'\r\n\r\n"When he came back I said, \'Doctor, what do you say now?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Why, sir,\' said he, \'he is a perfect "take-in." He knows more than\r\nall of them put together.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\nTALKED TO A WOMAN WHILE HIS RIVAL MILKED\r\n\r\nYoung Lincoln happened to call to speak to a leading farmer in the\r\ndistrict, and found his rival, a Democratic candidate, there on the same\r\nerrand. The farmer was away from home, so each of the candidates did his\r\nbest to gain the good-will of the farmer\'s "better half," who was on her\r\nway to milk the cow. The Democrat seized the pail and insisted on doing\r\nthe work for her. Lincoln did not make the slightest objection, but\r\nimproved the opportunity thus given to chat with their hostess. This he\r\ndid so successfully that when his rival had finished the unpleasant\r\ntask, the only acknowledgment he received was a profusion of thanks from\r\nthe woman for the opportunity he had given her of having "_such a\r\npleasant talk with Mr. Lincoln_!"\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE LIGHTNING STRUCK FORQUER, IN SPITE OF HIS LIGHTNING-ROD\r\n\r\nAbe distinguished himself in his first political speech at Springfield,\r\nthe county seat. A leading citizen there, George Forquer, was accused\r\nof changing his political opinions to secure a certain government\r\nposition; he also had his fine residence protected by the first\r\nlightning-rod ever seen in that part of the country.\r\n\r\nThe contest was close and exciting. There were seven Democratic and\r\nseven Whig candidates for the lower branch of the Legislature. Forquer,\r\nthough not a candidate, asked to be heard in reply to young Lincoln,\r\nwhom he proceeded to attack in a sneering overbearing way, ridiculing\r\nthe young man\'s appearance, dress, manners and so on. Turning to Lincoln\r\nwho then stood within a few feet of him, Forquer announced his intention\r\nin these words: "This young man must be taken down, and I am truly sorry\r\nthat the task devolves upon me."\r\n\r\nThe "Clary\'s Grove Boys," who attended the meeting in a body--or a\r\ngang!--could hardly be restrained from arising in their might and\r\nsmiting the pompous Forquer, hip and thigh.\r\n\r\nBut their hero, with pale face and flashing eyes, smiled as he shook his\r\nhead at them, and calmly answered the insulting speech of his opponent.\r\nAmong other things he said:\r\n\r\n"The gentleman commenced his speech by saying \'this young man,\' alluding\r\nto me, \'must be taken down.\' I am not so young in years as I am in the\r\ntricks and trades of a politician, but"--pointing at Forquer--"live long\r\nor die young, I would rather die now than, like the gentleman, change my\r\npolitics, and with the change receive an office worth three thousand\r\ndollars a year, and then feel obliged to erect a lightning-rod over my\r\nhouse to protect a guilty conscience from an offended God!"\r\n\r\nThis stroke blasted Forquer\'s political prospects forever, and satisfied\r\nthe Clary\'s Grove Boys that it was even better than all the things they\r\nwould have done to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nABE LINCOLN AS A "BLOATED ARISTOCRAT"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Lincoln\'s wit suddenly turned the tables on an\r\nabusive opponent. One of the Democratic orators was Colonel Dick Taylor,\r\na dapper, but bombastic little man, who rode in his carriage, and\r\ndressed richly. But, politically, he boasted of belonging to the\r\nDemocrats, "the bone and sinew, the hard-fisted yeomanry of the land,"\r\nand sneered at those "rag barons," those Whig aristocrats, the "silk\r\nstocking gentry!" As Abe Lincoln, the leading Whig present, was dressed\r\nin Kentucky jeans, coarse boots, a checkered shirt without a collar or\r\nnecktie, and an old slouch hat, Colonel Taylor\'s attack on the "bloated\r\nWhig aristocracy" sounded rather absurd.\r\n\r\nOnce the colonel made a gesture so violent that it tore his vest open\r\nand exposed his elegant shirt ruffles, his gold watch-fob, his seals and\r\nother ornaments to the view of all. Before Taylor, in his embarrassment,\r\ncould adjust his waistcoat, Lincoln stepped to the front exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"Behold the hard-fisted Democrat! Look at this specimen of \'bone and\r\nsinew\'--and here, gentlemen," laying his big work-bronzed hand on his\r\nheart and bowing obsequiously--"here, at your service, is your\r\n\'aristocrat!\' Here is one of your \'silk stocking gentry!\'" Then\r\nspreading out his great bony hands he continued, "Here is your \'rag\r\nbaron\' with his lily-white hands. Yes, I suppose I am, according to my\r\nfriend Taylor, a \'bloated aristocrat!\'"\r\n\r\nThe contrast was so ludicrous, and Abe had quoted the speaker\'s stock\r\nphrases with such a marvelous mimicry that the crowd burst into a roar,\r\nand Colonel Dick Taylor\'s usefulness as a campaign speaker was at an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder, then, that young Lincoln\'s wit, wisdom and power of\r\nridicule made him known in that campaign as one of the greatest orators\r\nin the State, or that he was elected by such an astonishing plurality\r\nthat the county, which had always been strongly Democratic, elected Whig\r\nrepresentatives that year.\r\n\r\nAfter Herculean labors "the Long Nine" succeeded in having the State\r\ncapital removed from Vandalia to Springfield. This move added greatly to\r\nthe influence and renown of its "prime mover," Abraham Lincoln, who was\r\nfeasted and "toasted" by the people of Springfield and by politicians\r\nall over the State. After reading "Blackstone" during his political\r\ncampaigns, young Lincoln fell in again with Major John T. Stuart, whom\r\nhe had met in the Black Hawk War, and who gave him helpful advice and\r\nlent him other books that he might "read law."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LINCOLN-STONE PROTEST\r\n\r\nAlthough he had no idea of it at the time, Abraham Lincoln took part in\r\na grander movement than the removal of a State capital. Resolutions were\r\nadopted in the Legislature in favor of slavery and denouncing the hated\r\n"abolitionists"--or people who spoke and wrote for the abolition of\r\nslavery. It required true heroism for a young man thus to stand out\r\nagainst the legislators of his State, but Abe Lincoln seems to have\r\nthought little of that. The hatred of the people for any one who opposed\r\nslavery was very bitter. Lincoln found one man, named Stone, who was\r\nwilling to sign a protest against the resolutions favoring slavery,\r\nwhich read as follows:\r\n\r\n        "Resolutions upon the subject of domestic\r\n        slavery having passed both branches of the\r\n        General Assembly at its present session, the\r\n        undersigned hereby protest against the passage\r\n        of the same.\r\n\r\n        "They believe that the institution of slavery\r\n        is founded on both injustice and bad policy.\r\n        [After several statements of their belief\r\n        concerning the powers of Congress, the protest\r\n        closed as follows:]\r\n\r\n        "The difference between their opinions and\r\n        those contained in the said resolution is their\r\n        reason for entering this protest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         "DAN STONE,\r\n                                         "A. LINCOLN."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMOVING TO SPRINGFIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Salem could no longer give young Lincoln scope for his growing power\r\nand influence. Within a few weeks after the Lincoln-Stone protest, late\r\nin March, 1837, after living six years in the little village which held\r\nso much of life and sorrow for him, Abe sold his surveying compass,\r\nmarking-pins, chain and pole, packed all his effects into his\r\nsaddle-bags, borrowed a horse of his good friend "Squire" Bowling Green,\r\nand reluctantly said good-bye to his friends there. It is a strange fact\r\nthat New Salem ceased to exist within a year from the day "Honest Abe"\r\nleft it. Even its little post office was discontinued by the Government.\r\n\r\nHenry C. Whitney, who was associated with Lincoln in those early days,\r\ndescribes Abe\'s modest entry into the future State capital, with all his\r\npossessions in a pair of saddle-bags, and calling at the store of Joshua\r\nF. Speed, overlooking "the square," in the following dialogue:\r\n\r\nSpeed--"Hello, Abe, just from Salem?"\r\n\r\nLincoln--"Howdy, Speed! Yes, this is my first show-up."\r\n\r\nSpeed--"So you are to be one of us?"\r\n\r\nLincoln--"I reckon so, if you will let me take pot luck with you."\r\n\r\nSpeed--"All right, Abe; it\'s better than Salem."\r\n\r\nLincoln--"I\'ve been to Gorman\'s and got a single bedstead; now you\r\nfigure out what it will cost for a tick, blankets and so forth."\r\n\r\nSpeed (after figuring)--"Say, seventeen dollars or so."\r\n\r\nLincoln (countenance paling)--"I had no _idea_ it would cost half that,\r\nand I--I can\'t pay it; but if you can wait on me till Christmas, and I\r\nmake anything, I\'ll pay; if I don\'t, I can\'t."\r\n\r\nSpeed--"I can do better than that; upstairs I sleep in a bed big enough\r\nfor two, and you just come and sleep with me till you can do better."\r\n\r\nLincoln (brightening)--"Good, where is it?"\r\n\r\nSpeed--"Upstairs behind that pile of barrels--turn to the right when you\r\ngo up."\r\n\r\nLincoln (returning joyously)--"Well, Speed, I\'ve moved!"\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUART & LINCOLN\r\n\r\nMajor Stuart had grown so thoroughly interested in Lincoln, approving\r\nthe diligence with which the young law student applied himself to the\r\nbooks which he had lent him, that, after his signal success in bringing\r\nabout the removal of the State capital to Springfield, the older man\r\ninvited the younger to go into partnership with him.\r\n\r\nAbe had been admitted to the bar the year before, and had practiced law\r\nin a small way before Squire Bowling Green in New Salem. Greatly\r\nflattered by the offer of such a man, Abe gladly accepted, and soon\r\nafter his arrival in Springfield this sign, which thrilled the junior\r\npartner\'s whole being, appeared in front of an office near the square:\r\n\r\n         ------------------------------\r\n        |    STUART & LINCOLN          |\r\n        | ATTORNEYS-AT-LAW             |\r\n         ------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n"I NEVER USE ANYONE\'S MONEY BUT MY OWN"\r\n\r\nAfter a while Lincoln left Speed\'s friendly loft and slept on a lounge\r\nin the law office, keeping his few effects in the little old-fashioned\r\ntrunk pushed out of sight under his couch.\r\n\r\nOne day an agent of the Post Office Department came in and asked if\r\nAbraham Lincoln could be found there. Abe arose and, reaching out his\r\nhand, said that was his name. The agent then stated his business; he had\r\ncome to collect a balance due the Post Office Department since the\r\nclosing of the post office at New Salem.\r\n\r\nThe young ex-postmaster looked puzzled for a moment, and a friend, who\r\nhappened to be present, hastened to his rescue with, "Lincoln, if you\r\nare in need of money, let us help you."\r\n\r\nAbe made no reply, but, pulling out his little old trunk, he asked the\r\nagent how much he owed. The man stated the amount, and he, opening the\r\ntrunk, took out an old cotton cloth containing coins, which he handed to\r\nthe official without counting, and it proved to be the exact sum\r\nrequired, over seventeen dollars, evidently the very pieces of money Abe\r\nhad received while acting as postmaster years before!\r\n\r\nAfter the department agent had receipted for the money and had gone out,\r\nMr. Lincoln quietly remarked:\r\n\r\n"I never use anyone\'s money but my own."\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPS THROUGH THE CEILING TO DEMAND FREE SPEECH\r\n\r\nStuart & Lincoln\'s office was, for a time, over a court room, which was\r\nused evenings as a hall. There was a square opening in the ceiling of\r\nthe court room, covered by a trap door in the room overhead where\r\nLincoln slept. One night there was a promiscuous crowd in the hall, and\r\nLincoln\'s friend, E. D. Baker, was delivering a political harangue.\r\nBecoming somewhat excited Baker made an accusation against a well-known\r\nnewspaper in Springfield, and the remark was resented by several in the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n"Pull him down!" yelled one of them as they came up to the platform\r\nthreatening Baker with personal violence. There was considerable\r\nconfusion which might become a riot.\r\n\r\nJust at this juncture the spectators were astonished to see a pair of\r\nlong legs dangling from the ceiling and Abraham Lincoln dropped upon the\r\nplatform. Seizing the water pitcher he took his stand beside the\r\nspeaker, and brandished it, his face ablaze with indignation.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," he said, when the confusion had subsided, "let us not\r\ndisgrace the age and the country in which we live. This is a land where\r\nfreedom of speech is guaranteed. Mr. Baker has a right to speak, and\r\nought to be permitted to do so. I am here to protect him and no man\r\nshall take him from this stand if I can prevent it." Lincoln had opened\r\nthe trap door in his room and silently watched the proceedings until he\r\nsaw that his presence was needed below. Then he dropped right into the\r\nmidst of the fray, and defended his friend and the right of free speech\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENDING THE DEFENSELESS\r\n\r\nA widow came to Mr. Lincoln and told him how an attorney had charged her\r\nan exorbitant fee for collecting her pension. Such cases filled him with\r\nrighteous wrath. He cared nothing for "professional etiquette," if it\r\npermitted the swindling of a poor woman. Going directly to the greedy\r\nlawyer, he forced him to refund to the widow all that he had charged in\r\nexcess of a fair fee for his services, or he would start proceedings at\r\nonce to prevent the extortionate attorney from practicing law any longer\r\nat the Springfield bar.\r\n\r\nIf a negro had been wronged in any way, Lawyer Lincoln was the only\r\nattorney in Springfield who dared to appear in his behalf, for he always\r\ndid so at great risk to his political standing. Sometimes he appeared in\r\ndefense of fugitive slaves, or negroes who had been freed or had run\r\naway from southern or "slave" States where slavery prevailed to gain\r\nliberty in "free" States in which slavery was not allowed. Lawyer\r\nLincoln did all this at the risk of making himself very unpopular with\r\nhis fellow-attorneys and among the people at large, the greater part of\r\nwhom were then in favor of permitting those who wished to own, buy and\r\nsell negroes as slaves.\r\n\r\nLincoln always sympathized with the poor and down-trodden. He could not\r\nbear to charge what his fellow-lawyers considered a fair price for the\r\namount of work and time spent on a case. He often advised those who came\r\nto him to settle their disputes without going to law. Once he told a man\r\nhe would charge him a large fee if he had to try the case, but if the\r\nparties in the dispute settled their difficulty without going into court\r\nhe would furnish them all the legal advice they needed free of charge.\r\nHere is some excellent counsel Lawyer Lincoln gave, in later life, in\r\nan address to a class of young attorneys:\r\n\r\n"Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever\r\nyou can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often the real\r\nloser--in fees, expenses and waste of time. As a peacemaker a lawyer has\r\na superior opportunity of becoming a good man. There will always be\r\nenough business. Never stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be\r\nfound than one who does this. Who can be more nearly a fiend than he who\r\nhabitually overhauls the register of deeds in search of defects in\r\ntitles whereon to stir up strife and put money in his pocket. A moral\r\ntone ought to be infused into the profession which should drive such men\r\nout of it."\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG LAWYER LINCOLN OFFERS TO PAY HALF THE DAMAGES\r\n\r\nA wagonmaker in Mechanicsville, near Springfield, was sued on account of\r\na disputed bill. The other side had engaged the best lawyer in the\r\nplace. The cartwright saw that his own attorney would be unable to\r\ndefend the case well. So, when the day of the trial arrived he sent his\r\nson-in-law to Springfield to bring Mr. Lincoln to save the day for him\r\nif possible. He said to the messenger:\r\n\r\n"Son, you\'ve just got time. Take this letter to my young friend, Abe\r\nLincoln, and bring him back in the buggy to appear in the case. Guess\r\nhe\'ll come if he can."\r\n\r\nThe young man from Mechanicsville found the lawyer in the street playing\r\n"knucks" with a troop of children and laughing heartily at the fun they\r\nwere all having. When the note was handed to him, Lincoln said:\r\n\r\n"All right, wait a minute," and the game soon ended amid peals of\r\nlaughter. Then the young lawyer jumped into the buggy. On the way back\r\nMr. Lincoln told his companion such funny stories that the young man,\r\nconvulsed with laughter, was unable to drive. The horse, badly broken,\r\nupset them into a ditch, smashing the vehicle.\r\n\r\n"You stay behind and look after the buggy," said the lawyer. "I\'ll walk\r\non."\r\n\r\nHe came, with long strides, into the court room just in time for the\r\ntrial and won the case for the wagonmaker.\r\n\r\n"What am I to pay you?" asked the client delighted.\r\n\r\n"I hope you won\'t think ten or fifteen dollars too much," said the young\r\nattorney, "and I\'ll pay half the hire of the buggy and half the cost of\r\nrepairing it."\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWYER LINCOLN AND MARY OWENS\r\n\r\nAbout the time Mr. Lincoln was admitted to the bar, Miss Mary Owens, a\r\nbright and beautiful young woman from Kentucky, came to visit her\r\nmarried sister near New Salem. The sister had boasted that she was going\r\nto "make a match" between her sister and Lawyer Lincoln. The newly\r\nadmitted attorney smiled indulgently at all this banter until he began\r\nto consider himself under obligations to marry Miss Owens if that young\r\nlady proved willing.\r\n\r\nAfter he went to live in Springfield, with no home but his office, he\r\nwrote the young lady a long, discouraging letter, of which this is a\r\npart:\r\n\r\n\r\n        "I am thinking of what we said about your\r\n        coming to live in Springfield. I am afraid you\r\n        would not be satisfied. There is a great deal\r\n        of flourishing about in carriages here, which\r\n        it would be your doom to see without sharing\r\n        it. You would have to be poor without the means\r\n        of hiding your poverty. Do you believe that you\r\n        could bear that patiently? Whatever woman may\r\n        cast her lot with mine, should any ever do so,\r\n        it is my intention to do all in my power to\r\n        make her happy and contented, and there is\r\n        nothing I can imagine that could make me more\r\n        unhappy than to fail in that effort. I know I\r\n        should be much happier with you than the way I\r\n        am, provided I saw no sign of discontent in\r\n        you.\r\n\r\n        "I much wish you would think seriously before\r\n        you decide. What I have said, I will most\r\n        positively abide by, provided you wish it. You\r\n        have not been accustomed to hardship, and it\r\n        may be more severe than you now imagine. I know\r\n        you are capable of thinking correctly on any\r\n        subject, and if you deliberate maturely upon\r\n        this before you decide, then I am willing to\r\n        abide by your decision.\r\n\r\n                                 "Yours, etc.,\r\n                                            "LINCOLN."\r\n\r\nFor a love letter this was nearly as cold and formal as a legal\r\ndocument. Miss Owens could see well enough that Lawyer Lincoln was not\r\nmuch in love with her, and she let him know, as kindly as she could,\r\nthat she was not disposed to cast her lot for life with an enforced\r\nlover, as he had proved himself to be. She afterward confided to a\r\nfriend that "Mr. Lincoln was deficient in those little links which make\r\nup the chain of a woman\'s happiness."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY RIVALRY BETWEEN LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Lincoln came to Springfield he met Stephen A. Douglas, a\r\nbrilliant little man from Vermont. The two seemed naturally to take\r\nopposing sides of every question. They were opposite in every way.\r\nLincoln was tall, angular and awkward. Douglas was small, round and\r\ngraceful--he came to be known as "the Little Giant." Douglas was a\r\nDemocrat and favored slavery. Lincoln was a Whig, and strongly opposed\r\nthat dark institution. Even in petty discussions in Speed\'s store, the\r\ntwo men seemed to gravitate to opposite sides. A little later they were\r\nrivals for the hand of the same young woman.\r\n\r\nOne night, in a convivial company, Mr. Douglas\'s attention was directed\r\nto the fact that Mr. Lincoln neither smoked nor drank. Considering this\r\na reflection upon his own habits, the little man sneered:\r\n\r\n"What, Mr. Lincoln, are you a temperance man?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied Lincoln with a smile full of meaning, "I\'m not exactly a\r\ntemperance man, but I am temperate in this, to wit:--I _don\'t drink_!"\r\n\r\nIn spite of this remark, Mr. Lincoln _was_ an ardent temperance man. One\r\nWashington\'s birthday he delivered a temperance address before the\r\nWashingtonian Society of Springfield, on "Charity in Temperance Reform,"\r\nin which he made a strong comparison between the drink habit and black\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGAN & LINCOLN\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the partnership between Stuart and Lincoln was dissolved and the\r\nyounger man became a member of the firm of Logan & Lincoln. This was\r\nconsidered a long step in advance for the young lawyer, as Judge Stephen\r\nT. Logan was known as one of the leading lawyers in the State. From\r\nthis senior partner he learned to make the thorough study of his cases\r\nthat characterized his work throughout his later career.\r\n\r\nWhile in partnership with Logan, Mr. Lincoln was helping a young fellow\r\nnamed "Billy" Herndon, a clerk in his friend Speed\'s store, advising him\r\nin his law studies and promising to give the youth a place in his own\r\noffice as soon as young Herndon should be fitted to fill it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT LINCOLN DID WITH HIS FIRST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE\r\n\r\nDuring the interim between two partnerships, after he had left Major\r\nStuart, and before he went into the office with Logan, Mr. Lincoln\r\nconducted a case alone. He worked very hard and made a brilliant success\r\nof it, winning the verdict and a five hundred dollar fee. When an old\r\nlawyer friend called on him, Lincoln had the money spread out on the\r\ntable counting it over.\r\n\r\n"Look here, judge," said the young lawyer. "See what a heap of money\r\nI\'ve got from that case. Did you ever see anything like it? Why, I never\r\nin my life had so much money all at once!"\r\n\r\nThen his manner changed, and crossing his long arms on the table he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"I have got just five hundred dollars; if it were only seven hundred and\r\nfifty I would go and buy a quarter section (160 acres) of land and give\r\nit to my old stepmother."\r\n\r\nThe friend offered to lend him the two hundred and fifty dollars needed.\r\nWhile drawing up the necessary papers, the old judge gave the young\r\nlawyer this advice:\r\n\r\n"Lincoln, I wouldn\'t do it quite that way. Your stepmother is getting\r\nold, and, in all probability, will not live many years. I would settle\r\nthe property upon her for use during her lifetime, to revert to you upon\r\nher death."\r\n\r\n"I shall do no such thing," Lincoln replied with deep feeling. "It is a\r\npoor return, at best, for all the good woman\'s devotion to me, and there\r\nis not going to be any half-way business about it."\r\n\r\nThe dutiful stepson did as he planned. Some years later he was obliged\r\nto write to John Johnston, his stepmother\'s son, appealing to him not to\r\ntry to induce his mother to sell the land lest the old woman should lose\r\nthe support he had provided for her in her declining years.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN LOVE WITH A BELLE FROM LEXINGTON\r\n\r\nLincoln\'s popularity in Sangamon County, always increasing, was greatly\r\nstrengthened by the part he had taken in the removal of the capital to\r\nSpringfield, which was the county seat as well as the State capital. So\r\nhe was returned to the Legislature, now held in Springfield, time after\r\ntime, without further effort on his part. He was looked upon as a young\r\nman with a great future. While he was in the office with Major Stuart\r\nthat gentleman\'s cousin, Miss Mary Todd, a witty, accomplished young\r\nlady from Lexington, Kentucky, came to Springfield to visit her sister,\r\nwife of Ninian W. Edwards, one of the "Long Nine" in the State Assembly.\r\n\r\nMiss Todd was brilliant and gay, a society girl--in every way the\r\nopposite of Mr. Lincoln--and he was charmed with everything she said and\r\ndid. Judge Douglas was one of her numerous admirers, and it is said that\r\nthe Louisville belle was so flattered by his attentions that she was in\r\ndoubt, for a time, which suitor to accept. She was an ambitious young\r\nwoman, having boasted from girlhood that she would one day be mistress\r\nof the White House.\r\n\r\nTo all appearances Douglas was the more likely to fulfill Miss Todd\'s\r\nhigh ambition. He was a society man, witty in conversation, popular with\r\nwomen as well as with men, and had been to Congress, so he had a\r\nnational reputation, while Lincoln\'s was only local, or at most confined\r\nto Sangamon County and the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Illinois.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Douglas was already addicted to drink, and Miss Todd saw\r\ndoubtless that he could not go on long at the rapid pace he was keeping\r\nup. It is often said that she was in favor of slavery, as some of her\r\nrelatives who owned slaves, years later, entered the Confederate ranks\r\nto fight against the Union. But the remarkable fact that she finally\r\nchose Lincoln shows that her sympathies were against slavery, and she\r\nthus cut herself off from several members of her own family. With a\r\nwoman\'s intuition she saw the true worth of Abraham Lincoln, and before\r\nlong they were understood to be engaged.\r\n\r\nBut the young lawyer, after his recent experience with Mary Owens,\r\ndistrusted his ability to make any woman happy--much less the belle from\r\nLouisville, so brilliant, vivacious, well educated and exacting. He\r\nseemed to grow morbidly conscious of his shortcomings, and she was\r\nhigh-strung. A misunderstanding arose, and, between such exceptional\r\nnatures, "the course of true love never did run smooth."\r\n\r\nTheir engagement, if they were actually betrothed, was broken, and the\r\nlawyer-lover was plunged in deep melancholy. He wrote long, morbid\r\nletters to his friend Speed, who had returned to Kentucky, and had\r\nrecently married there. Lincoln even went to Louisville to visit the\r\nSpeeds, hoping that the change of scene and friendly sympathies and\r\ncounsel would revive his health and spirits.\r\n\r\nIn one of his letters Lincoln bemoaned his sad fate and referred to "the\r\nfatal 1st of January," probably the date when his engagement or "the\r\nunderstanding" with Mary Todd was broken. From this expression, one of\r\nLincoln\'s biographers elaborated a damaging fiction, stating that\r\nLincoln and his affianced were to have been married that day, that the\r\nwedding supper was ready, that the bride was all dressed for the\r\nceremony, the guests assembled--but the melancholy bridegroom failed to\r\ncome to his own wedding!\r\n\r\nIf such a thing had happened in a little town like Springfield in those\r\ndays, the guests would have told of it, and everybody would have\r\ngossiped about it. It would have been a nine days\' wonder, and such a\r\ngreat joker as Lincoln would "never have heard the last of it."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE EVENTS LEADING UP TO LINCOLN\'S MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nAfter Lincoln\'s return from visiting the Speeds in Louisville, he threw\r\nhimself into politics again, not, however, in his own behalf. He\r\ndeclined to be a candidate again for the State Legislature, in which he\r\nhad served four consecutive terms, covering a period of eight years. He\r\nengaged enthusiastically in the "Log Cabin" campaign of 1840, when the\r\ncountry went for "Tippecanoe and Tyler, too," which means that General\r\nWilliam Henry Harrison, the hero of the battle of Tippecanoe, and John\r\nTyler were elected President and Vice-President of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 the young lawyer had so far recovered from bodily illness and\r\nmental unhappiness as to write more cheerful letters to his friend Speed\r\nof which two short extracts follow:\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that I should have been entirely happy but for the\r\nnever-absent idea that there is one (Miss Todd) still unhappy whom I\r\nhave contributed to make so. That still kills my soul. I cannot but\r\nreproach myself for even wishing to be happy while she is otherwise. She\r\naccompanied a large party on the railroad cars to Jacksonville last\r\nMonday, and at her return spoke, so I heard of it, of having \'enjoyed\r\nthe trip exceedingly.\' God be praised for that."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"You will see by the last _Sangamon Journal_ that I made a temperance\r\nspeech on the 22d of February, which I claim that Fanny and you shall\r\nread as an act of charity toward me; for I cannot learn that anybody has\r\nread it or is likely to. Fortunately it is not long, and I shall deem it\r\na sufficient compliance with my request if one of you listens while the\r\nother reads it."\r\n\r\nEarly the following summer Lincoln wrote for the _Sangamon Journal_ a\r\nhumorous criticism of State Auditor Shields, a vain and "touchy" little\r\nman. This was in the form of a story and signed by "Rebecca of the Lost\r\nTownships." The article created considerable amusement and might have\r\npassed unnoticed by the conceited little auditor if it had not been\r\nfollowed by another, less humorous, but more personal and satirical,\r\nsigned in the same way, but the second communication was written by two\r\nmischievous (if not malicious) girls--Mary Todd and her friend, Julia\r\nJayne. This stinging attack made Shields wild with rage, and he demanded\r\nthe name of the writer of it. Lincoln told the editor to give Shields\r\n_his_ name as if he had written both contributions and thus protect the\r\ntwo young ladies. The auditor then challenged the lawyer to fight a\r\nduel. Lincoln, averse to dueling, chose absurd weapons, imposed\r\nridiculous conditions and tried to treat the whole affair as a huge\r\njoke. When the two came face to face, explanations became possible and\r\nthe ludicrous duel was avoided. Lincoln\'s conduct throughout this\r\nhumiliating affair plainly showed that, while Shields would gladly have\r\nkilled _him_, he had no intention of injuring the man who had challenged\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMary Todd\'s heart seems to have softened toward the young man who was\r\nwilling to risk his life for her sake, and the pair, after a long and\r\nmiserable misunderstanding on both sides, were happily married on the\r\n4th of November, 1842. Their wedding ceremony was the first ever\r\nperformed in Springfield by the use of the Episcopal ritual.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the guests, bluff old Judge Tom Brown, saw the bridegroom\r\nplacing the ring on Miss Todd\'s finger, and repeating after the\r\nminister, "With this ring"--"I thee wed"--"and with all"--"my worldly\r\ngoods"--"I thee endow"--he exclaimed, in a stage whisper:\r\n\r\n"Grace to Goshen, Lincoln, the statute fixes all that!"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Speed, not long after this event, the happy bridegroom\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n"We are not keeping house but boarding at the Globe Tavern, which is\r\nvery well kept now by a widow lady of the name of Beck. Our rooms are\r\nthe same Dr. Wallace occupied there, and boarding only costs four\r\ndollars a week (for the two). I most heartily wish you and your family\r\nwill not fail to come. Just let us know the time, a week in advance, and\r\nwe will have a room prepared for you and we\'ll all be merry together for\r\na while."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLINCOLN & HERNDON\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG HERNDON\'S STRANGE FASCINATION FOR LINCOLN\r\n\r\nLincoln remained in the office with Judge Logan about four years,\r\ndissolving partnership in 1845. Meanwhile he was interesting himself in\r\nbehalf of young William H. Herndon, who, after Speed\'s removal to\r\nKentucky, had gone to college at Jacksonville, Ill. The young man seemed\r\nto be made of the right kind of metal, was industrious, and agreeable,\r\nand Mr. Lincoln looked forward to the time when he could have "Billy"\r\nwith him in a business of his own.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln, with that marvelous instinct which women often possess,\r\nopposed her husband\'s taking Bill Herndon into partnership. While the\r\nyoung man was honest and capable enough, he was neither brilliant nor\r\nsteady. He contracted the habit of drinking, the bane of Lincoln\'s\r\nbusiness career. As Mr. Lincoln had not yet paid off "the national debt"\r\nlargely due to his first business partner\'s drunkenness, it seems\r\nrather strange that he did not listen to his wife\'s admonitions. But\r\nyoung Herndon seems always to have exercised a strange fascination over\r\nhis older friend and partner.\r\n\r\nWhile yet in partnership with Judge Logan, Mr. Lincoln went into the\r\nnational campaign of 1844, making speeches in Illinois and Indiana for\r\nHenry Clay, to whom he was thoroughly devoted.\r\n\r\nBefore this campaign Lincoln had written to Mr. Speed:\r\n\r\n"We had a meeting of the Whigs of the county here last Monday to appoint\r\ndelegates to a district convention; and Baker beat me, and got the\r\ndelegation instructed to go for him. The meeting, in spite of my\r\nattempts to decline it, appointed me one of the delegates, so that in\r\ngetting Baker the nomination I shall be fixed like a fellow who is made\r\na groomsman to a fellow that has cut him out, and is marrying his own\r\ndear \'gal.\'"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, about this time, was offered the nomination for Governor of\r\nIllinois, and declined the honor. Mrs. Lincoln, who had supreme\r\nconfidence in her husband\'s ability, tried to make him more\r\nself-seeking in his political efforts. He visited his old home in\r\nIndiana, making several speeches in that part of the State. It was\r\nfourteen years after he and all the family had removed to Illinois. One\r\nof his speeches was delivered from the door of a harness shop near\r\nGentryville, and one he made in the "Old Carter Schoolhouse." After this\r\naddress he drove home with Mr. Josiah Crawford--"Old Blue Nose" for whom\r\nhe had "pulled fodder" to pay an exorbitant price for Weems\'s "Life of\r\nWashington," and in whose house his sister and he had lived as hired\r\ngirl and hired man. He delighted the old friends by asking about\r\neverybody, and being interested in the "old swimming-hole," Jones\'s\r\ngrocery where he had often argued and "held forth," the saw-pit, the old\r\nmill, the blacksmith shop, whose owner, Mr. Baldwin, had told him some\r\nof his best stories, and where he once started in to learn the\r\nblacksmith\'s trade. He went around and called on all his former\r\nacquaintances who were still living in the neighborhood. His memories\r\nwere so vivid and his emotions so keen that he wrote a long poem about\r\nthis, from which the following are three stanzas:\r\n\r\n        "My childhood\'s home I see again\r\n           And sadden with the view;\r\n         And still, as memory crowds the brain,\r\n           There\'s pleasure in it, too.\r\n\r\n        "Ah, Memory! thou midway world\r\n           \'Twixt earth and paradise,\r\n         Where things decayed and loved ones lost\r\n           In dreamy shadows rise.\r\n\r\n        "And freed from all that\'s earthy, vile,\r\n           Seems hallowed, pure and bright,\r\n         Like scenes in some enchanted isle,\r\n           All bathed in liquid light."\r\n\r\n\r\nTRYING TO SAVE BILLY FROM A BAD HABIT\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Lincoln spent so much of his time away from Springfield he felt\r\nthat he needed a younger assistant to "keep office" and look after his\r\ncases in the different courts. He should not have made "Billy" Herndon\r\nan equal partner, but he did so, though the young man had neither the\r\nability nor experience to earn anything like half the income of the\r\noffice. If Herndon had kept sober and done his best he might have made\r\nsome return for all that Mr. Lincoln, who treated him like a\r\nfoster-father, was trying to do for him. But "Billy" did nothing of the\r\nsort. He took advantage of his senior partner\'s absences by going on\r\nsprees with several dissipated young men about town.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT LAWYER LINCOLN DID WITH A FAT FEE\r\n\r\nA Springfield gentleman relates the following story which shows Lawyer\r\nLincoln\'s business methods, his unwillingness to charge much for his\r\nlegal services; and his great longing to save his young partner from the\r\nclutches of drink:\r\n\r\n"My father," said the neighbor, "was in business, facing the square, not\r\nfar from the Court House. He had an account with a man who seemed to be\r\ndoing a good, straight business for years, but the fellow disappeared\r\none night, owing father about $1000. Time went on and father got no\r\ntrace of the vanished debtor. He considered the account as good as lost.\r\n\r\n"But one day, in connection with other business, he told Mr. Lincoln he\r\nwould give him half of what he could recover of that bad debt. The tall\r\nattorney\'s deep gray eyes twinkled as he said, \'One-half of nought is\r\nnothing. I\'m neither a shark nor a shyster, Mr. Man. If I should collect\r\nit, I would accept only my regular percentage.\'\r\n\r\n"\'But I mean it,\' father said earnestly. \'I should consider it as good\r\nas finding money in the street.\'\r\n\r\n"\'And "the finder will be liberally rewarded," eh?\' said Mr. Lincoln\r\nwith a laugh.\r\n\r\n"\'Yes,\' my father replied, \'that\'s about the size of it; and I\'m glad if\r\nyou understand it. The members of the bar here grumble because you\r\ncharge too little for your professional services, and I\'m willing to do\r\nmy share toward educating you in the right direction.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Well, seein\' as it\'s you,\' said Mr. Lincoln with a whimsical smile,\r\n\'considering that you\'re such an intimate friend, I\'d do it for _twice_\r\nas much as I\'d charge a _total stranger_! Is that satisfactory?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I should not be satisfied with giving you less than half the gross\r\namount collected--in this case,\' my father insisted. \'I don\'t see why\r\nyou are so loath to take what is your due, Mr. Lincoln. You have a\r\nfamily to support and will have to provide for the future of several\r\nboys. They need money and are as worthy of it as any other man\'s wife\r\nand sons.\'\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lincoln put out his big bony hand as if to ward off a blow,\r\nexclaiming in a pained tone:\r\n\r\n"\'That isn\'t it, Mr. Man. That isn\'t it. I yield to no man in love to my\r\nwife and babies, and I provide enough for them. Most of those who bring\r\ntheir cases to me need the money more than I do. Other lawyers rob them.\r\nThey act like a pack of wolves. They have no mercy. So when a needy\r\nfellow comes to me in his trouble--sometimes it\'s a poor widow--I can\'t\r\ntake much from them. I\'m not much of a Shylock. I always try to get them\r\nto settle it without going into court. I tell them if they will make it\r\nup among themselves I won\'t charge them anything.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Well, Mr. Lincoln,\' said father with a laugh, \'if they were all like\r\nyou there would be no need of lawyers.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Well,\' exclaimed Lawyer Lincoln with a quizzical inflection which\r\nmeant much. \'Look out for the millennium, Mr. Man--still, as a great\r\nfavor, I\'ll charge you a fat fee if I ever find that fellow and can get\r\nanything out of him. But that\'s like promising to give you half of the\r\nfirst dollar I find floating up the Sangamon on a grindstone, isn\'t it?\r\nI\'ll take a big slice, though, out of the grindstone itself, if you say\r\nso,\' and the tall attorney went out with the peculiar laugh that\r\nafterward became world-famous.\r\n\r\n"Not long afterward, while in Bloomington, out on the circuit, Mr.\r\nLincoln ran across the man who had disappeared from Springfield \'between\r\ntwo days,\' carrying on an apparently prosperous business under an\r\nassumed name. Following the man to his office and managing to talk with\r\nhim alone, the lawyer, by means of threats, made the man go right to the\r\nbank and draw out the whole thousand then. It meant payment in full or\r\nthe penitentiary. The man understood it and went white as a sheet. In\r\nall his sympathy for the poor and needy, Mr. Lincoln had no pity on the\r\nflourishing criminal. Money could not purchase the favor of Lincoln.\r\n\r\n"Well, I hardly know which half of that thousand dollars father was\r\ngladder to get, but I honestly believe he was more pleased on Mr.\r\nLincoln\'s account than on his own.\r\n\r\n"\'Let me give you your five hundred dollars before I change my mind,\' he\r\nsaid to the attorney.\r\n\r\n"\'One hundred dollars is all I\'ll take out of that,\' Mr. Lincoln replied\r\nemphatically. \'It was no trouble, and--and I haven\'t earned even that\r\nmuch.\'\r\n\r\n"\'But Mr. Lincoln,\' my father demurred, \'you promised to take half.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, but you got my word under false pretenses, as it were. Neither of\r\nus had the least idea I would collect the bill even if I ever found the\r\nfellow.\'\r\n\r\n"As he would not accept more than one hundred dollars that day, father\r\nwouldn\'t give him any of the money due, for fear the too scrupulous\r\nattorney would give him a receipt in full for collecting. Finally, Mr.\r\nLincoln went away after yielding enough to say he might accept two\r\nhundred and fifty dollars sometime in a pinch of some sort.\r\n\r\n"The occasion was not long delayed--but it was not because of illness or\r\nany special necessity in his own family. His young partner, \'Billy\'\r\nHerndon, had been carousing with several of his cronies in a saloon\r\naround on Fourth Street, and the gang had broken mirrors, decanters and\r\nother things in their drunken spree. The proprietor, tired of such work,\r\nhad had them all arrested.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lincoln, always alarmed when Billy failed to appear at the usual\r\nhour in the morning, went in search of him, and found him and his\r\npartners in distress, locked up in the calaboose. The others were\r\nhelpless, unable to pay or to promise to pay for any of the damages, so\r\nit devolved on Mr. Lincoln to raise the whole two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars the angry saloon keeper demanded.\r\n\r\n"He came into our office out of breath and said sheepishly:\r\n\r\n"\'I reckon I can use that two-fifty now.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Check or currency?\' asked father.\r\n\r\n"\'Currency, if you\'ve got it handy.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Give Mr. Lincoln two hundred and fifty dollars,\' father called to a\r\nclerk in the office.\r\n\r\n"There was a moment\'s pause, during which my father refrained from\r\nasking any questions, and Mr. Lincoln was in no mood to give\r\ninformation. As soon as the money was brought, the tall attorney seized\r\nthe bills and stalked out without counting it or saying anything but\r\n\'Thankee, Mr. Man,\' and hurried diagonally across the square toward the\r\nCourt House, clutching the precious banknotes in his bony talons.\r\n\r\n"Father saw him cross the street so fast that the tails of his long coat\r\nstood out straight behind; then go up the Court House steps, two at a\r\ntime, and disappear.\r\n\r\n"We learned afterward what he did with the money. Of course, Bill\r\nHerndon was penitent and promised to mend his ways, and, of course, Mr.\r\nLincoln believed him. He took the money very much against his will, even\r\nagainst his principles--thinking it might save his junior partner from\r\nthe drunkard\'s grave. But the heart of Abraham Lincoln was hoping\r\nagainst hope."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nHIS KINDNESS OF HEART\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTTING TWO YOUNG BIRDS BACK IN THE NEST\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln\'s tender-heartedness was the subject of much amusement among\r\nhis fellow attorneys. One day, while out riding with several friends,\r\nthey missed Lincoln. One of them, having heard the distressed cries of\r\ntwo young birds that had fallen from the nest, surmised that this had\r\nsomething to do with Mr. Lincoln\'s disappearance. The man was right.\r\nLincoln had hitched his horse and climbed the fence into the thicket\r\nwhere the fledglings were fluttering on the ground in great fright. He\r\ncaught the young birds and tenderly carried them about until he found\r\ntheir nest. Climbing the tree he put the birdlings back where they\r\nbelonged. After an hour Mr. Lincoln caught up with his companions, who\r\nlaughed at him for what they called his "childishness." He answered them\r\nearnestly:\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, you may laugh, but I could not have slept tonight if I had\r\nnot saved those little birds. The mother\'s cries and theirs would have\r\nrung in my ears."\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWYER LINCOLN, IN A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES, RESCUING A PIG STUCK IN THE\r\nMUD\r\n\r\nLawyer Lincoln rode from one county-seat to another, on the Eighth\r\nJudicial Circuit of Illinois, either on the back of a raw-boned horse,\r\nor in a rickety buggy drawn by the same old "crowbait," as his legal\r\nfriends called the animal. The judge and lawyers of the several courts\r\ntraveled together and whiled away the time chatting and joking. Of\r\ncourse, Abraham Lincoln was in great demand because of his unfailing\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\nOne day he appeared in a new suit of clothes. This was such a rare\r\noccurrence that the friends made remarks about it. The garments did not\r\nfit him very well, and the others felt in duty bound to "say things"\r\nwhich were anything but complimentary.\r\n\r\nAs they rode along through the mud they were making Lincoln the butt of\r\ntheir gibes. He was not like most jokers, for he could take as well as\r\ngive, while he could "give as good as he got."\r\n\r\nIn the course of their "chaffing" they came to a spot about four miles\r\nfrom Paris, Illinois, where they saw a pig stuck in the mud and\r\nsquealing lustily. The men all laughed at the poor animal and its absurd\r\nplight.\r\n\r\n"Poor piggy!" exclaimed Mr. Lincoln impulsively. "Let\'s get him out of\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nThe others jeered at the idea. "You\'d better do it. You\'re dressed for\r\nthe job!" exclaimed one.\r\n\r\n"Return to your wallow!" laughed another, pointing in great glee to the\r\nwallowing hog and the mudhole.\r\n\r\nLincoln looked at the pig, at the deep mud, then down at his new\r\nclothes. Ruefully he rode on with them for some time. But the cries of\r\nthe helpless animal rang in his ears. He could endure it no longer.\r\nLagging behind the rest, he waited until they had passed a bend in the\r\nroad. Then he turned and rode back as fast as his poor old horse could\r\ncarry him through the mud. Dismounting, he surveyed the ground. The pig\r\nhad struggled until it was almost buried in the mire, and was now too\r\nexhausted to move. After studying the case as if it were a problem in\r\ncivil engineering, he took some rails off the fence beside the road.\r\nBuilding a platform of rails around the now exhausted hog, then taking\r\none rail for a lever and another for a fulcrum, he began gently to pry\r\nthe fat, helpless creature out of the sticky mud. In doing this he\r\nplastered his new suit from head to foot, but he did not care, as long\r\nas he could save that pig!\r\n\r\n"Now, piggy-wig," he said. "It\'s you and me for it. You do your part and\r\nI\'ll get you out. Now--\'one-two-_three_--_up-a-daisy_!\'"\r\n\r\nHe smiled grimly as he thought of the jeers and sneers that would be\r\nhurled at him if his friends had stayed to watch him at this work.\r\n\r\nAfter long and patient labor he succeeded in loosening the hog and\r\ncoaxing it to make the attempt to get free. At last, the animal was\r\nmade to see that it could get out. Making one violent effort it wallowed\r\naway and started for the nearest farmhouse, grunting and flopping its\r\nears as it went.\r\n\r\nLawyer Lincoln looked ruefully down at his clothes, then placed all the\r\nrails back on the fence as he had found them.\r\n\r\nHe had to ride the rest of the day alone, for he did not wish to appear\r\nbefore his comrades until the mud on his suit had dried so that it could\r\nbe brushed off. That night, when they saw him at the tavern, they asked\r\nhim what he had been doing all day, eying his clothes with suspicious\r\nleers and grins. He had to admit that he could not bear to leave that\r\nhog to die, and tried to excuse his tender-heartedness to them by\r\nadding: "Farmer Jones\'s children might have had to go barefoot all\r\nWinter if he had lost a valuable hog like that!"\r\n\r\n\r\n"BEING ELECTED TO CONGRESS HAS NOT PLEASED ME AS MUCH AS I EXPECTED"\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress, defeating the Rev.\r\nPeter Cartwright, the famous backwoods preacher, who was elected to the\r\nState Legislature fourteen years before, the first time Lincoln was a\r\ncandidate and the only time he was ever defeated by popular vote.\r\nCartwright had made a vigorous canvass, telling the people that Lincoln\r\nwas "an aristocrat and an atheist." But, though they had a great respect\r\nfor Peter Cartwright and his preaching, the people did not believe all\r\nthat he said against Lincoln, and they elected him. Shortly after this\r\nhe wrote again to Speed:\r\n\r\n        "You, no doubt, assign the suspension of our\r\n        correspondence to the true philosophic cause;\r\n        though it must be confessed by both of us that\r\n        this is a rather cold reason for allowing such\r\n        a friendship as ours to die out by degrees.\r\n\r\n        "Being elected to Congress, though I am very\r\n        grateful to our friends for having done it, has\r\n        not pleased me as much as I expected."\r\n\r\nIn the same letter he imparted to his friend some information which\r\nseems to have been much more interesting to him than being elected to\r\nCongress:\r\n\r\n        "We have another boy, born the 10th of March\r\n        (1846). He is very much such a child as Bob was\r\n        at his age, rather of a longer order. Bob is\r\n        \'short and low,\' and I expect always will be.\r\n        He talks very plainly, almost as plainly as\r\n        anybody. He is quite smart enough. I sometimes\r\n        fear he is one of the little rare-ripe sort\r\n        that are smarter at five than ever after.\r\n\r\n        "Since I began this letter, a messenger came to\r\n        tell me Bob was lost; but by the time I reached\r\n        the house his mother had found him and had him\r\n        whipped, and by now very likely he has run away\r\n        again!\r\n\r\n                                    "As ever yours,\r\n                                             "A. LINCOLN."\r\n\r\nThe new baby mentioned in this letter was Edward, who died in 1850,\r\nbefore his fourth birthday. "Bob," or Robert, the eldest of the\r\nLincoln\'s four children, was born in 1843. William, born in 1850, died\r\nin the White House. The youngest was born in 1853, after the death of\r\nThomas Lincoln, so he was named for his grandfather, but he was known\r\nonly by his nickname, "Tad." "Little Tad" was his father\'s constant\r\ncompanion during the terrible years of the Civil War, especially after\r\nWillie\'s death, in 1862. "Tad" became "the child of the nation." He died\r\nin Chicago, July 10, 1871, at the age of eighteen, after returning from\r\nEurope with his widowed mother and his brother Robert. Robert has served\r\nhis country as Secretary of War and Ambassador to the English court, and\r\nis recognized as a leader in national affairs.\r\n\r\nWhen Lincoln was sent to the national House of Representatives, Douglas\r\nwas elected to the Senate for the first time. Lincoln was the only Whig\r\nfrom Illinois. This shows his great personal popularity. Daniel Webster\r\nwas then living in the national capital, and Congressman Lincoln stopped\r\nonce at Ashland, Ky., on his way to Washington to visit the idol of the\r\nWhigs, Henry Clay.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Lincoln was elected, an editor wrote to ask him for a\r\nbiographical sketch of himself for the "Congressional Directory." This\r\nis all Mr. Lincoln wrote--in a blank form sent for the purpose:\r\n\r\n"Born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky.\r\n\r\n"Education defective.\r\n\r\n"Profession, lawyer.\r\n\r\n"Military service, captain of volunteers in Black Hawk War.\r\n\r\n"Offices held: Postmaster at a very small office; four times a member of\r\nthe Illinois Legislature, and elected to the lower House of the next\r\nCongress."\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was in Congress while the Mexican War was in progress, and\r\nthere was much discussion over President Polk\'s action in declaring that\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Lincoln was obliged to stay in Springfield to care for her two\r\nlittle boys, Congressman Lincoln lived in a Washington boarding-house.\r\nHe soon gained the reputation of telling the best stories at the\r\ncapital. He made a humorous speech on General Cass, comparing the\r\ngeneral\'s army experiences with his own in the Black Hawk War. He also\r\ndrafted a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, which was\r\nnever brought to a vote. Most of his care seems to have been for Billy\r\nHerndon, who wrote complaining letters to him about the "old men" in\r\nSpringfield who were always trying to "keep the young men down." Here\r\nare two of Mr. Lincoln\'s replies:\r\n\r\n\r\n        "WASHINGTON, June 22, 1848.\r\n\r\n        "DEAR WILLIAM:\r\n\r\n        "Judge how heart-rending it was to come to my\r\n        room and find and read your discouraging letter\r\n        of the 15th. Now, as to the young men, you must\r\n        not wait to be brought forward by the older\r\n        men. For instance, do you suppose that I would\r\n        ever have got into notice if I had waited to be\r\n        hunted up and pushed forward by older men?"\r\n\r\n        "DEAR WILLIAM:\r\n\r\n        "Your letter was received last night. The\r\n        subject of that letter is exceedingly painful\r\n        to me; and I cannot but think that there is\r\n        some mistake in your impression of the motives\r\n        of the old men. Of course I cannot demonstrate\r\n        what I say; but I was young once, and I am sure\r\n        I was never ungenerously thrust back. I hardly\r\n        know what to say. The way for a young man to\r\n        rise is to improve himself every way he can,\r\n        never suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder\r\n        him. Allow me to assure you that suspicion and\r\n        jealousy never did keep any man in any\r\n        situation. There may be sometimes ungenerous\r\n        attempts to keep a young man down; and they\r\n        will succeed, too, if he allows his mind to be\r\n        diverted from its true channel to brood over\r\n        the attempted injury. Cast about, and see if\r\n        this feeling has not injured every person you\r\n        have ever known to fall into it.\r\n\r\n        "Now in what I have said, I am sure you will\r\n        suspect nothing but sincere friendship. I would\r\n        save you from a fatal error. You have been a\r\n        laborious, studious young man. You are far\r\n        better informed on almost all subjects than I\r\n        have ever been. You cannot fail in any laudable\r\n        object, unless you allow your mind to be\r\n        improperly directed. I have somewhat the\r\n        advantage of you in the world\'s experience,\r\n        merely by being older; and it is this that\r\n        induces me to advise.\r\n\r\n                         "Your friend, as ever,\r\n                                       "A. LINCOLN."\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST DAYS OF THOMAS LINCOLN\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln did not allow his name to be used as a candidate for\r\nre-election, as there were other men in the congressional district who\r\ndeserved the honor of going to Washington as much as he. On his way home\r\nfrom Washington, after the last session of the Thirtieth Congress, he\r\nvisited New England, where he made a few speeches, and stopped at\r\nNiagara Falls, which impressed him so strongly that he wrote a lecture\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nAfter returning home he made a flying visit to Washington to enter his\r\npatent steamboat, equipped so that it would navigate shallow western\r\nrivers. This boat, he told a friend, "would go where the ground is a\r\nlittle damp." The model of Lincoln\'s steamboat is one of the sights of\r\nthe Patent Office to this day.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Lincoln had settled down to his law business, permanently, as\r\nhe hoped, his former fellow-clerk, William G. Greene, having business in\r\nColes County, went to "Goosenest Prairie" to call on Abe\'s father and\r\nstepmother, who still lived in a log cabin. Thomas Lincoln received his\r\nson\'s friend very hospitably. During the young man\'s visit, the father\r\nreverted to the old subject, his disapproval of his son\'s wasting his\r\ntime in study. He said:\r\n\r\n"I s\'pose Abe\'s still a-foolin\' hisself with eddication. I tried to stop\r\nit, but he\'s got that fool _idee_ in his head an\' it can\'t be got out.\r\nNow I haint got no eddication, but I git along better than if I had."\r\n\r\nNot long after this, in 1851, Abraham learned that his father was very\r\nill. As he could not leave Springfield then, he wrote to his stepbrother\r\n(for Thomas Lincoln could not read) the following comforting letter to\r\nbe read to his father:\r\n\r\n"I sincerely hope father may recover his health; but at all events, tell\r\nhim to remember to call upon and confide in our great and merciful\r\nMaker, who will not turn away from him in any extremity. He notes the\r\nfall of the sparrow, and numbers the hairs of our heads, and He will not\r\nforget the dying man who puts his trust in Him. Say to him that, if we\r\ncould meet now, it is doubtful whether it would be more painful than\r\npleasant, but if it is his lot to go now, he will soon have a joyful\r\nmeeting with the loved ones gone before, and where the rest of us,\r\nthrough the mercy of God, hope ere long to join them."\r\n\r\nThomas Lincoln died that year, at the age of seventy-three.\r\n\r\n\r\nA KIND BUT MASTERFUL LETTER TO HIS STEPBROTHER\r\n\r\nAfter his father\'s death Abraham Lincoln had, on several occasions, to\r\nprotect his stepmother against the schemes of her own lazy,\r\ngood-for-nothing son. Here is one of the letters written, at this time,\r\nto his stepbrother, John Johnston:\r\n\r\n"DEAR BROTHER: I hear that you were anxious to sell the land where you\r\nlive, and move to Missouri. What can you do in Missouri better than\r\nhere? Is the land any richer? Can you there, any more than here, raise\r\ncorn and wheat and oats without work? Will anybody there, any more than\r\nhere, do your work for you? If you intend to go to work, there is no\r\nbetter place than right where you are; if you do not intend to go to\r\nwork, you cannot get along anywhere. Squirming and crawling about from\r\nplace to place can do no good. You have raised no crop this year, and\r\nwhat you really want is to sell the land, get the money and spend it.\r\nPart with the land you have and, my life upon it, you will never own a\r\nspot big enough to bury you in. Half you will get for the land you will\r\nspend in moving to Missouri, and the other half you will eat and drink\r\nand wear out, and no foot of land will be bought.\r\n\r\n"Now, I feel that it is my duty to have no hand in such a piece of\r\nfoolery. I feel it is so even on your own account, and particularly on\r\nmother\'s account.\r\n\r\n"Now do not misunderstand this letter. I do not write it in any\r\nunkindness. I write it in order, if possible, to get you to face the\r\ntruth, which truth is, you are destitute because you have idled away\r\nyour time. Your thousand pretenses deceive nobody but yourself. Go to\r\nwork is the only cure for your case."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nWHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND HIS STEPBROTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nThese letters show the wide difference between the real lives of two\r\nboys brought up in the same surroundings, and under similar conditions.\r\nThe advantages were in John Johnston\'s favor. He and Dennis Hanks never\r\nrose above the lower level of poverty and ignorance. John was looked\r\ndown upon by the poor illiterates around him as a lazy, good-for-nothing\r\nfellow, and Dennis Hanks was known to be careless about telling the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the early life of Abe\'s father and mother, Dennis threw\r\nin the remark that "the Hankses was some smarter than the Lincolns." It\r\nwas not "smartness" that made Abe Lincoln grow to be a greater man than\r\nDennis Hanks. There are men in Springfield to-day who say, "There were a\r\ndozen smarter men in this town than Mr. Lincoln when he happened to be\r\nnominated, and peculiar conditions prevailing at that time brought about\r\nhis election to the presidency!"\r\n\r\nTrue greatness is made of goodness rather than smartness. Abraham\r\nLincoln was honest with himself while a boy and a man, and it was\r\n"Honest Abe" who became President of the United States. The people loved\r\nhim for his big heart--because he loved them more than he loved himself\r\nand they knew it. In his second inaugural address as President he used\r\nthis expression: "With malice toward none, with charity for all." This\r\nwas not a new thought, but it was full of meaning to the country because\r\nlittle Abe Lincoln had _lived_ that idea all his life, with his own\r\nfamily, his friends, acquaintances, and employers. He became the most\r\nbeloved man in the world, in his own or any other time, because he\r\nhimself loved everybody.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crawford, the wife of "Old Blue Nose," used to laugh at the very\r\nidea of Abe Lincoln ever becoming President. Lincoln often said to her:\r\n"I\'ll get ready and the time will come." He got ready in his father\'s\r\nlog hut and when the door of opportunity opened he walked right into the\r\nWhite House. He "made himself at home" there, because he had only to go\r\non in the same way after he became the "servant of the people" that he\r\nhad followed when he was "Old Blue Nose\'s" hired boy and man.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE PARTNER IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE OTHER IN THE POOR HOUSE\r\n\r\nThen there was William H. Herndon, known to the world only because he\r\nhappened to be "Lincoln\'s law partner." His advantages were superior to\r\nLincoln\'s. And far more than that, he had his great partner\'s help to\r\npush him forward and upward. But "poor Billy" had an unfortunate\r\nappetite. He could not deny himself, though it always made him ashamed\r\nand miserable. It dragged him down, down from "the President\'s partner"\r\nto the gutter. That was not all. When he asked his old partner to give\r\nhim a government appointment which he had, for years, been making\r\nhimself wholly unworthy to fill, President Lincoln, much as he had loved\r\nBilly all along, could not give it to him. It grieved Mr. Lincoln\'s\r\ngreat heart to refuse Billy anything. But Herndon did not blame himself\r\nfor all that. He spent the rest of his wretched life in bitterness and\r\nspite--avenging himself on his noble benefactor by putting untruths into\r\nthe "Life of Lincoln" he was able to write because Abraham Lincoln,\r\nagainst the advice of his wife and friends, had insisted on keeping him\r\nclose to his heart. It is a terrible thing--that spirit of spite! Among\r\nmany good and true things he _had_ to say about his fatherly law\r\npartner, he poisoned the good name of Abraham Lincoln in the minds of\r\nmillions, by writing stealthy slander about Lincoln\'s mother and wife,\r\nand made many people believe that the most religious of men at heart was\r\nan infidel (because he himself was one!), that Mr. Lincoln sometimes\r\nacted from unworthy and unpatriotic motives, and that he failed to come\r\nto his own wedding. If these things had been true it would have been\r\nwrong to publish them to the prejudice of a great man\'s good name--then\r\nhow much more wicked to invent and spread broadcast falsehoods which\r\nhurt the heart and injure the mind of the whole world--just to spite the\r\nmemory of the best friend a man ever had!\r\n\r\nThe fate of the firm of Lincoln & Herndon shows in a striking way how\r\nthe world looks upon the heart that hates and the heart that loves, for\r\nthe hateful junior partner died miserably in an almshouse, but the\r\nsenior was crowned with immortal martyrdom in the White House.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIVAL FOR LOVE AND HONORS\r\n\r\nStephen A. Douglas, "the Little Giant," who had been a rival for the\r\nhand of the fascinating Mary Todd, was also Lincoln\'s chief opponent in\r\npolitics. Douglas was small and brilliant; used to society ways, he\r\nseemed always to keep ahead of his tall, uncouth, plodding competitor.\r\nAfter going to Congress, Mr. Lincoln was encouraged to aspire even\r\nhigher, so, ten years later, he became a candidate for the Senate.\r\nSlavery was then the burning question, and Douglas seemed naturally to\r\nfall upon the opposite side, favoring and justifying it in every way he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nDouglas was then a member of the Senate, but the opposing party\r\nnominated Lincoln to succeed him, while "the Little Giant" had been\r\nrenominated to succeed himself. Douglas sneered at his tall opponent,\r\ntrying to "damn him with faint praise" by referring to him as "a kind,\r\namiable and intelligent gentleman." Mr. Lincoln challenged the Senator\r\nto discuss the issues of the hour in a series of debates.\r\n\r\nDouglas was forced, very much against his will, to accept, and the\r\ndebates took place in seven towns scattered over the State of Illinois,\r\nfrom August 21st to October 15th, 1858. Lincoln had announced his belief\r\nthat "a house divided against itself cannot stand;" therefore the United\r\nStates could not long exist "half slave and half free."\r\n\r\n"The Little Giant" drove from place to place in great style, traveling\r\nwith an escort of influential friends. These discussions, known in\r\nhistory as the "Lincoln-Douglas Debates," rose to national importance\r\nwhile they were in progress, by attracting the attention, in the\r\nnewspapers, of voters all over the country. They were attended, on an\r\naverage, by ten thousand persons each, both men being accompanied by\r\nbands and people carrying banners and what Mr. Lincoln called\r\n"fizzlegigs and fireworks."\r\n\r\nSome of the banners were humorous.\r\n\r\n         ------------------------\r\n        |                        |\r\n        |  Abe the Giant-Killer  |\r\n        |                        |\r\n         ------------------------\r\n\r\nwas one. Another read:\r\n\r\n         -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n        |                                                           |\r\n        |  Westward the Star of Empire takes its way;               |\r\n        |The girls link on to Lincoln, their mothers were for Clay. |\r\n        |                                                           |\r\n         -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt the first debate Lincoln took off his linen duster and, handing it to\r\na bystander, said:\r\n\r\n"Hold my coat while I stone Stephen!"\r\n\r\nIn the course of these debates Lincoln propounded questions for Mr.\r\nDouglas to answer. Brilliant as "the Little Giant" was, he was not\r\nshrewd enough to defend himself from the shafts of his opponent\'s wit\r\nand logic. So he fell into Lincoln\'s trap.\r\n\r\n"If he does that," said Lincoln, "he may be Senator, but he can never be\r\nPresident. I am after larger game. The battle of 1860 is worth a hundred\r\nof this."\r\n\r\nThis prophecy proved true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nHOW EMANCIPATION CAME TO PASS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Abraham Lincoln was a small boy he began to show the keenest\r\nsympathy for the helpless and oppressed. The only time he betrayed anger\r\nas a child was, as you already have learned, when he saw the other boys\r\nhurting a mud-turtle. In his first school "composition," on "Cruelty to\r\nAnimals," his stepsister remembers this sentence: "An ant\'s life is as\r\nsweet to it as ours is to us."\r\n\r\nAs you have read on an earlier page, when Abe grew to be a big, strong\r\nboy he saved a drunken man from freezing in the mud, by carrying him to\r\na cabin, building a fire, and spent the rest of the night warming and\r\nsobering him up. Instead of leaving the drunkard to the fate the other\r\nfellows thought he deserved, Abe Lincoln, through pity for the helpless,\r\nrescued a fellow-being not only from mud and cold but also from a\r\ndrunkard\'s grave. For that tall lad\'s love and mercy revealed to the\r\npoor creature the terrible slavery of which he was the victim. Thus Abe\r\nhelped him throw off the shackles of drink and made a man of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK SLAVES AND WHITE\r\n\r\nAs he grew older, Abe Lincoln saw that the drink habit was a sort of\r\nhuman slavery. He delivered an address before the Washingtonian\r\n(Temperance) Society in which he compared white slavery with black, in\r\nwhich he said:\r\n\r\n"And when the victory shall be complete--when there shall be neither a\r\nslave nor a drunkard on the earth--how proud the title of that land\r\nwhich may truly claim to be the birthplace and the cradle of both those\r\nrevolutions that have ended in that victory."\r\n\r\nThis address was delivered on Washington\'s Birthday, 1842. The closing\r\nwords throb with young Lawyer Lincoln\'s fervent patriotism:\r\n\r\n"This is the one hundred and tenth anniversary of the birth of\r\nWashington; we are met to celebrate this day. Washington is the\r\nmightiest name of earth, long since the mightiest in the cause of civil\r\nliberty, still mightiest in moral reformation. On that name no eulogy is\r\nexpected. It cannot be. To add to the brightness of the sun or glory to\r\nthe name of Washington is alike impossible. Let none attempt it. In\r\nsolemn awe we pronounce the name and, in its naked, deathless splendor,\r\nleave it shining on."\r\n\r\nIt was young Lincoln\'s patriotic love for George Washington which did so\r\nmuch to bring about, in time, a double emancipation from white slavery\r\nand black.\r\n\r\nOnce, as President, he said to a boy who had just signed the temperance\r\npledge:\r\n\r\n"Now, Sonny, keep that pledge and it will be the best act of your life."\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln was true and consistent in his temperance principles.\r\nIn March, 1864, he went by steamboat with his wife and "Little Tad," to\r\nvisit General Grant at his headquarters at City Point, Virginia.\r\n\r\nWhen asked how he was, during the reception which followed his arrival\r\nthere, the President said, as related by General Horace Porter:\r\n\r\n"\'I am not feeling very well. I got pretty badly shaken up on the bay\r\ncoming down, and am not altogether over it yet.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Let me send for a bottle of champagne for you, Mr. President,\' said a\r\nstaff-officer, \'that\'s the best remedy I know of for sea-sickness.\'\r\n\r\n"\'No, no, my young friend,\' replied the President, \'I\'ve seen many a\r\nman in my time seasick ashore from drinking that very article.\'\r\n\r\n"That was the last time any one screwed up sufficient courage to offer\r\nhim wine."\r\n\r\n\r\n"THE UNDER DOG"\r\n\r\nSome people are kinder to dumb animals--is it _because_ they are\r\ndumb?--than to their relatives. Many are the stories of Lincoln\'s\r\ntenderness to beasts and birds. But his kindness did not stop there, nor\r\nwith his brothers and sisters in white. He recognized his close\r\nrelationship with the black man, and the bitterest name his enemies\r\ncalled him--worse in their minds than "fool," "clown," "imbecile" or\r\n"gorilla"--was a "Black Republican." That terrible phobia against the\r\nnegro only enlisted Abraham Lincoln\'s sympathies the more. He appeared\r\nin court in behalf of colored people, time and again. The more bitter\r\nthe hatred and oppression of others, the more they needed his\r\nsympathetic help, the more certain they were to receive it.\r\n\r\n"My sympathies are with the under dog," said Mr. Lincoln, one day,\r\n"though it is often that dog that starts the fuss."\r\n\r\nThe fact that the poor fellow may have brought the trouble upon himself\r\ndid not make him forfeit Abraham Lincoln\'s sympathy. That was only a\r\ngood lesson to him to "Look out and do better next time!"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nAfter he went to Washington, President Lincoln was between two fires.\r\nOne side wanted the slaves freed whether the Union was broken up or not.\r\nThey could not see that declaring them free would have but little\r\neffect, if the government could not "back up" such a declaration.\r\n\r\nThe other party did not wish the matter tampered with, as cheap labor\r\nwas necessary for raising cotton, sugar and other products on which the\r\nliving of millions of people depended.\r\n\r\nThe extreme Abolitionists, who wished slavery abolished, whether or no,\r\nsent men to tell the President that if he did not free the slaves he was\r\na coward and a turncoat, and they would withhold their support from the\r\nGovernment and the Army.\r\n\r\nDelegations of Abolitionists from all over the North arrived almost\r\ndaily from different cities to urge, coax and threaten the President.\r\nThey did not know that he was trying to keep the Border States of\r\nMaryland, Kentucky and Missouri from seceding. If Maryland alone had\r\ngone out of the Union, Washington, the national capital, would have been\r\nsurrounded and forced to surrender.\r\n\r\nBesides, at this time, the armies of the North were losing nearly all\r\nthe battles.\r\n\r\nTo declare all the slaves down South freed, when the Government could\r\nnot enforce such a statement and could not even win a battle, would be\r\nabsurd. To one committee the President said: "If I issued a proclamation\r\nof emancipation now it would be like the Pope\'s bull (or decree) against\r\nthe comet!"\r\n\r\nA delegation of Chicago ministers came to beg Mr. Lincoln to free the\r\nslaves. He patiently explained to them that his declaring them free\r\nwould not make them free. These men seemed to see the point and were\r\nretiring, disappointed, when one of them returned to him and whispered\r\nsolemnly:\r\n\r\n"What you have said to us, Mr. President, compels me to say to you in\r\nreply that it is a message from our divine Master, through me,\r\ncommanding you, sir, to open the doors of bondage that the slave may go\r\nfree!"\r\n\r\n"Now, isn\'t that strange?" the President replied instantly. "Here I am,\r\nstudying this question, day and night, and God has placed it upon me,\r\ntoo. Don\'t you think it\'s rather odd that He should send such a message\r\nby way of that awful wicked city of Chicago?"\r\n\r\nThe ministers were shocked at such an answer from the President of the\r\nUnited States. They could not know, for Mr. Lincoln dared not tell them,\r\nthat he had the Emancipation Proclamation in his pocket waiting for a\r\nFederal victory before he could issue it!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\nThen, came the news of Antietam, a terrible battle, but gained by the\r\nNorthern arms. At last the time had come to announce the freeing of the\r\nslaves that they might help in winning their liberties. The President\r\nhad not held a meeting of his Cabinet for some time. He thought of the\r\noccasion when, as a young man he went on a flatboat trip to New Orleans\r\nand saw, for the first, the horrors of negro slavery, and said to his\r\ncompanions:\r\n\r\n"If ever I get a chance to hit that thing I\'ll hit it hard!"\r\n\r\nNow the "chance to hit that thing"--the inhuman monster of human\r\nslavery--had come, and he was going to "hit it hard."\r\n\r\nHe called the Cabinet together. Edwin M. Stanton, the Secretary of War,\r\nhas described the scene:\r\n\r\n"On the 22nd of September, 1862, I had a sudden and peremptory call to a\r\nCabinet meeting at the White House. I went immediately and found the\r\nhistoric War Cabinet of Abraham Lincoln assembled, every member being\r\npresent. The President hardly noticed me as I came in. He was reading a\r\nbook of some kind which seemed to amuse him. It was a little book. He\r\nfinally turned to us and said:\r\n\r\n"\'Gentlemen, did you ever read anything from "Artemus Ward?" Let me read\r\nyou a chapter that is very funny.\'\r\n\r\n"Not a member of the Cabinet smiled; as for myself, I was angry, and\r\nlooked to see what the President meant. It seemed to me like buffoonery.\r\nHe, however, concluded to read us a chapter from \'Artemus Ward,\' which\r\nhe did with great deliberation. Having finished, he laughed heartily,\r\nwithout a member of the Cabinet joining in the laughter.\r\n\r\n"\'Well,\' he said, \'let\'s have another chapter.\'\r\n\r\n"I was considering whether I should rise and leave the meeting abruptly,\r\nwhen he threw the book down, heaved a long sigh, and said:\r\n\r\n"\'Gentlemen, why don\'t you laugh? With the fearful strain that is upon\r\nme night and day, if I did not laugh I should die, and you need this\r\nmedicine as much as I do.\'\r\n\r\n"He then put his hand in his tall hat that sat upon the table, and\r\npulled out a little paper. Turning to the members of the Cabinet, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"\'Gentlemen, I have called you here upon very important business. I have\r\nprepared a little paper of much significance. I have made up my mind\r\nthat this paper is to issue; that the time is come when it should issue;\r\nthat the people are ready for it to issue.\r\n\r\n"\'It is due to my Cabinet that you should be the first to hear and know\r\nof it, and if any of you have any suggestions to make as to the form of\r\nthis paper or its composition, I shall be glad to hear them. But the\r\npaper is to issue.\'\r\n\r\n"And, to my astonishment, he read the Emancipation Proclamation of that\r\ndate, which was to take effect the first of January following."\r\n\r\nSecretary Stanton continued: "I have always tried to be calm, but I\r\nthink I lost my calmness for a moment, and with great enthusiasm I\r\narose, approached the President, extended my hand and said:\r\n\r\n"\'Mr. President, if the reading of chapters of "Artemus Ward" is a\r\nprelude to such a deed as this, the book should be filed among the\r\narchives of the nation, and the author should be canonized. Henceforth I\r\nsee the light and the country is saved.\'\r\n\r\n"And all said \'Amen!\'\r\n\r\n"And Lincoln said to me in a droll way, just as I was leaving, \'Stanton,\r\nit would have been too early last Spring.\'\r\n\r\n"And as I look back upon it, I think the President was right."\r\n\r\nIt was a fitting fulfillment of the Declaration of Independence, which\r\nproclaimed that:\r\n\r\n"All men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with\r\ncertain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the\r\npursuit of happiness."\r\n\r\nThat Declaration young Abe Lincoln first read in the Gentryville\r\nconstable\'s copy of the "Statutes of Indiana."\r\n\r\nAt noon on the first of January, 1863, William H. Seward, Secretary of\r\nState, with his son Frederick, called at the White House with the\r\nEmancipation document to be signed by the President. It was just after\r\nthe regular New Year\'s Day reception.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln seated himself at his table, took up the pen, dipped it in\r\nthe ink, held the pen a moment, then laid it down. After waiting a while\r\nhe went through the same movements as before. Turning to his Secretary\r\nof State, he said, to explain his hesitation:\r\n\r\n"I have been shaking hands since nine o\'clock this morning, and my arm\r\nis almost paralyzed. If my name ever goes into history, it will be for\r\nthis act, and my whole soul is in it. If my hand trembles when I sign\r\nthe Proclamation, all who examine the document hereafter will say:\r\n\r\n"\'He hesitated.\'"\r\n\r\nTurning back to the table, he took the pen again and wrote, deliberately\r\nand firmly, the "Abraham Lincoln" with which the world is now familiar.\r\nLooking up at the Sewards, father and son, he smiled and said, with a\r\nsigh of relief:\r\n\r\n"_That will do!_"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE GLORY OF GETTYSBURG\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Gettysburg, which raged through July 1st, 2nd and 3d,\r\n1863, was called the "high water mark" of the Civil War, and one of the\r\n"fifteen decisive battles" of history. It was decisive because General\r\nRobert E. Lee, with his brave army, was driven back from Gettysburg,\r\nPennsylvania. If Lee had been victorious there, he might have destroyed\r\nPhiladelphia and New York. By such a brilliant stroke he could have\r\nsurrounded and captured Baltimore and Washington. This would have\r\nchanged the grand result of the war.\r\n\r\nIn point of numbers, bravery and genius, the battle of Gettysburg was\r\nthe greatest that had ever been fought up to that time. Glorious as this\r\nwas, the greatest glory of Gettysburg lay in the experiences and\r\nutterances of one man, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nIt came at a terrible time in the progress of the war, when everything\r\nseemed to be going against the Union. There had been four disastrous\r\ndefeats--twice at Bull Run, followed by Fredericksburg and\r\nChancellorsville. Even the battle of Antietam, accounted victory enough\r\nfor the President to issue his Emancipation Proclamation, proved to be a\r\ndrawn battle, with terrific losses on both sides. Lee was driven back\r\nfrom Maryland then, it is true, but he soon won the great battles of\r\nFredericksburg and Chancellorsville, and had made his way north into\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe night after the battle of Chancellorsville (fought May 2nd and 3d,\r\n1863), was the darkest in the history of the Civil War. President\r\nLincoln walked the floor the whole night long, crying out in his\r\nanguish, "O what will the country say!"\r\n\r\nTo fill the decimated ranks of the army, the Government had resorted to\r\nthe draft, which roused great opposition in the North and provoked\r\nfoolish, unreasoning riots in New York City.\r\n\r\nAfter winning the battle of Gettysburg, which the President hoped would\r\nend the war, General Meade, instead of announcing that he had captured\r\nthe Confederate army, stated that he had "driven the invaders from our\r\nsoil." Mr. Lincoln fell on his knees and, covering his face with his\r\ngreat, strong hands, cried out in tones of agony:\r\n\r\n"\'Driven the invaders from our soil!\' My God, is that all?"\r\n\r\nBut Lincoln\'s spirits were bound to rise. Believing he was "on God\'s\r\nside," he felt that the cause of Right could not lose, for the Lord\r\nwould save His own.\r\n\r\nThe next day, July 4th, 1863, came the surrender of Vicksburg, the\r\nstronghold of the great West. Chastened joy began to cover his gaunt and\r\npallid features, and the light of hope shone again in his deep, gray\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nCalling on General Sickles, in a Washington hospital--for the general\r\nhad lost a leg on the second day of the battle of Gettysburg--the\r\nPresident was asked why he believed that victory would be given the\r\nFederal forces at Gettysburg.\r\n\r\n"I will tell you how it was. In the pinch of your campaign up there,\r\nwhen everybody seemed panic-stricken, and nobody could tell what was\r\ngoing to happen, I went to my room one day and locked the door, and got\r\ndown on my knees before Almighty God, and prayed to him mightily for\r\nvictory at Gettysburg. I told Him this was His war, and our cause His\r\ncause, but that we couldn\'t stand another Fredericksburg or\r\nChancellorsville. And I then and there made a solemn vow to Almighty God\r\nthat if He would stand by our boys at Gettysburg, I would stand by Him.\r\nAnd He _did_, and I _will_!"\r\n\r\nThe President\'s call on General Sickles was on the Sunday after the\r\nthree-days\' battle of Gettysburg, before the arrival of the gunboat at\r\nCairo, Illinois, with the glad tidings from Vicksburg, which added new\r\nluster to the patriotic joy of Independence Day. The telegraph wires had\r\nbeen so generally cut on all sides of Vicksburg that the news was sent\r\nto Cairo and telegraphed to Washington. In proof that his faith even\r\nincluded the Mississippi blockade he went on:\r\n\r\n"Besides, I have been praying over Vicksburg also, and believe our\r\nHeavenly Father is going to give us victory there, too, because we need\r\nit, in order to bisect the Confederacy, and let \'the Father of Waters\r\nflow unvexed to the sea.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADDRESS\r\n\r\nNot long after the conflict at Gettysburg a movement was on foot to\r\ndevote a large part of that battle-ground to a national cemetery.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Edward Everett, prominent in national and educational affairs,\r\nand the greatest living orator, was invited to deliver the grand\r\noration. The President was asked, if he could, to come and make a few\r\ndedicatory remarks, but Mr. Everett was to be the chief speaker of the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday before the 19th of November, 1863, the date of the\r\ndedication, the President went with his friend Noah Brooks to Gardner\'s\r\ngallery, in Washington, where he had promised to sit for his photograph.\r\nWhile there he showed Mr. Brooks a proof of Everett\'s oration which had\r\nbeen sent to him. As this printed address covered two newspaper pages,\r\nMr. Lincoln struck an attitude and quoted from a speech by Daniel\r\nWebster:\r\n\r\n"Solid men of Boston, make no long orations!" and burst out laughing.\r\nWhen Mr. Brooks asked about _his_ speech for that occasion, Mr. Lincoln\r\nreplied: "I\'ve got it written, but not licked into shape yet. It\'s\r\nshort, _short_, SHORT!"\r\n\r\nDuring the forenoon of the 18th, Secretary John Hay was anxious lest the\r\nPresident be late for the special Presidential train, which was to leave\r\nat noon for Gettysburg.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry, John," said Mr. Lincoln. "I\'m like the man who was going\r\nto be hung, and saw the crowds pushing and hurrying past the cart in\r\nwhich he was being taken to the place of execution. He called out to\r\nthem: \'Don\'t hurry, boys. There won\'t be anything going on till I get\r\nthere!\'"\r\n\r\nWhen the train stopped, on the way to Gettysburg, a little girl on the\r\nplatform held up a bouquet to Mr. Lincoln, lisping: "Flowerth for the\r\nPrethident."\r\n\r\nHe reached out, took her up and kissed her, saying:\r\n\r\n"You\'re a sweet little rosebud yourself. I hope your life will open into\r\nperpetual beauty and goodness."\r\n\r\nAbout noon on the 19th of November, the distinguished party arrived in a\r\nprocession and took seats on the platform erected for the exercises. The\r\nPresident was seated in a rocking-chair placed there for him. There\r\nwere fifteen thousand people waiting, some of whom had been standing in\r\nthe sun for hours. It was a warm day and a Quaker woman near the\r\nplatform fainted. An alarm was given and the unconscious woman was in\r\ndanger of being crushed.\r\n\r\nThe President sprang to the edge of the staging and called out:\r\n\r\n"Here, let me get hold of that lady."\r\n\r\nWith a firm, strong grasp he extricated her from the crush and seated\r\nher in his rocking-chair. When that modest woman "came to," she saw\r\nfifteen thousand pairs of eyes watching her while the President of the\r\nUnited States was fanning her tenderly.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for her. She gasped:\r\n\r\n"I feel--better--now. I want to go--back to--my husband!"\r\n\r\n"Now, my dear lady," said Mr. Lincoln. "You are all right here. I had an\r\nawful time pulling you up out of there, and I couldn\'t stick you back\r\nagain!"\r\n\r\nA youth who stood near the platform in front of the President says that,\r\nwhile Mr. Everett was orating, Mr. Lincoln took his "little speech," as\r\nhe called it, out of his pocket, and conned it over like a schoolboy\r\nwith a half-learned lesson. The President had put the finishing touches\r\non it that morning. As it was expected that the President would make a\r\nfew offhand remarks, no one seems to have noticed its simple grandeur\r\nuntil it was printed in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nYet Mr. Lincoln was interrupted four or five times during the two\r\nminutes by applause. The fact that the President was speaking was\r\nsufficient, no matter what he said. The people would have applauded\r\nAbraham Lincoln if he had merely recited the multiplication table! When\r\nhe finished, they gave "three times three cheers" for the President of\r\nthe United States, and three cheers for each of the State Governors\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon there was a patriotic service in one of the churches\r\nwhich the President decided to attend. Taking Secretary Seward with him,\r\nhe called on an old cobbler named John Burns, of whose courage in the\r\nbattle of Gettysburg Mr. Lincoln had just heard. Those who planned the\r\ndedication did not think the poor cobbler was of much account. The old\r\nhero, now known through Bret Harte\'s poem, "John Burns of Gettysburg,"\r\nhad the pride and joy of having all the village and visitors see him\r\nmarch to the church between President Lincoln and Secretary Seward. This\r\nsimple act was "just like Lincoln!" He honored Gettysburg in thus\r\nhonoring one of its humblest citizens. It was Abraham Lincoln\'s tribute\r\nto the patriotism of the dear "common people" whom he said "God must\r\nlove."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n"NO END OF A BOY"\r\n\r\n\r\n"THE STORY OF YOUNG ABRAHAM LINCOLN" would be incomplete without some\r\ninsight into the perfect boyishness of the President of the United\r\nStates. When the cares of State and the horrors of war had made his\r\nhomely yet beautiful face pallid and seamed, till it became a sensitive\r\nmap of the Civil War, it was said that the only times the President was\r\never happy were when he was playing with little Tad.\r\n\r\nHe used to carry the boy on his shoulder or "pick-a-back," cantering\r\nthrough the spacious rooms of the Executive Mansion, both yelling like\r\nComanches. The little boy was lonely after Willie died, and the father\'s\r\nheart yearned over the only boy left at home, for Robert was at Harvard\r\nuntil near the close of the war, when he went to the front as an aide to\r\nGeneral Grant. So little Tad was his father\'s most constant companion\r\nand the President became the boy\'s only playfellow. Mr. Lincoln, with a\r\nheart as full of faith as a little child\'s, had always lived in deep\r\nsympathy with the children, and this feeling was intensified toward his\r\nown offspring.\r\n\r\nWhen Abe Lincoln was living in New Salem he distinguished himself by\r\ncaring for the little children--a thing beneath the dignity of the other\r\nyoung men of the settlement.\r\n\r\nHannah Armstrong, wife of the Clary\'s Grove bully, whom Abe had to\r\n"lick" to a finish in order to establish himself on a solid basis in New\r\nSalem society, told how friendly their relations became after the\r\nthrashing he gave her husband:\r\n\r\n"Abe would come to our house, drink milk, eat mush, cornbread and\r\nbutter, bring the children candy and rock the cradle." (This seemed a\r\nstrange thing to her.) "He would nurse babies--do anything to\r\naccommodate anybody."\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW HE REPAID THE ARMSTRONGS\' KINDNESS\r\n\r\nThe Armstrong baby, Willie, grew to be a youth of wrong habits, and was\r\nnicknamed "Duff." He was drawn, one afternoon, into a bad quarrel with\r\nanother rough young man, named Metzker, who was brutally beaten. In the\r\nevening a vicious young man, named Morris, joined the row and the lad\r\nwas struck on the head and died without telling who had dealt the fatal\r\nblow. The blame was thrown upon "Duff" Armstrong, who was arrested.\r\nIllinois law preventing him from testifying in his own behalf.\r\n\r\nWhen Lawyer Lincoln heard of the case, he wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                      "SPRINGFIELD, ILL., September, 1857.\r\n\r\n        "DEAR MRS. ARMSTRONG:\r\n\r\n        "I have just heard of your deep affliction, and\r\n        the arrest of your son for murder.\r\n\r\n        "I can hardly believe that he can be capable of\r\n        the crime alleged against him.\r\n\r\n        "It does not seem possible. I am anxious that\r\n        he should be given a fair trial, at any rate;\r\n        and gratitude for your long-continued kindness\r\n        to me in adverse circumstances prompts me to\r\n        offer my humble services gratuitously in his\r\n        behalf.\r\n\r\n        "It will afford me an opportunity to requite,\r\n        in a small degree, the favors I received at\r\n        your hand, and that of your lamented husband,\r\n        when your roof afforded me a grateful shelter,\r\n        without money and without price.\r\n\r\n                                    "Yours truly,\r\n                                           "A. LINCOLN."\r\n\r\nThe feeling in the neighborhood where the crime was committed was so\r\nintense that it was decided that it must be taken over to the next\r\ncounty to secure a fair trial. Lawyer Lincoln was on hand to defend the\r\nson of his old friend.\r\n\r\nBesides those who testified to the bad character of the young prisoner,\r\none witness, named Allen, testified that he saw "Duff" Armstrong strike\r\nthe blow which killed Metzker.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t you be mistaken about this?" asked Mr. Lincoln. "What time did\r\nyou see it?"\r\n\r\n"Between nine and ten o\'clock that night."\r\n\r\n"Are you certain that you saw the prisoner strike the blow?--Be\r\ncareful--remember--you are under oath!"\r\n\r\n"I am sure. There is no doubt about it."\r\n\r\n"But wasn\'t it dark at that hour?"\r\n\r\n"No, the moon was shining bright."\r\n\r\n"Then you say there was a moon and it was not dark."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was light enough for me to see him hit Metzker on the head."\r\n\r\n"Now I want you to be very careful. I understand you to say the murder\r\nwas committed about half past nine o\'clock, and there was a bright moon\r\nat the time?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said the witness positively.\r\n\r\n"Very well. That is all."\r\n\r\nThen Lawyer Lincoln produced an almanac showing that there was no moon\r\nthat night till the early hours of the morning.\r\n\r\n"This witness has perjured himself," he said, "and his whole story is a\r\nlie."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Duff" Armstrong was promptly acquitted. The tears of that widowed\r\nmother and the gratitude of the boy he had rocked were the best sort of\r\npay to Lawyer Lincoln for an act of kindness and life-saving.\r\n\r\n\r\n"JUST WHAT\'S THE MATTER WITH THE WHOLE WORLD!"\r\n\r\nA Springfield neighbor used to say that it was almost a habit with Mr.\r\nLincoln to carry his children about on his shoulders. Indeed, the man\r\nsaid he seldom saw the tall lawyer go by without one or both boys\r\nperched on high or tugging at the tails of his long coat. This neighbor\r\nrelates that he was attracted to the door of his own house one day by a\r\ngreat noise of crying children, and saw Mr. Lincoln passing with the two\r\nboys in their usual position, and both were howling lustily.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr. Lincoln, what\'s the matter?" he asked in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Just what\'s the matter with the whole world," the lawyer replied\r\ncoolly. "I\'ve got three walnuts, and each wants two."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE "BUCKING" CHESS BOARD\r\n\r\nSeveral years later Judge Treat, of Springfield was playing chess with\r\nMr. Lincoln in his law office when Tad came in to call his father to\r\nsupper. The boy, impatient at the delay of the slow and silent game,\r\ntried to break it up by a flank movement against the chess board, but\r\nthe attacks were warded off, each time, by his father\'s long arms.\r\n\r\nThe child disappeared, and when the two players had begun to believe\r\nthey were to be permitted to end the game in peace, the table suddenly\r\n"bucked" and the board and chessmen were sent flying all over the floor.\r\n\r\nJudge Treat was much vexed, and expressed impatience, not hesitating to\r\ntell Mr. Lincoln that the boy ought to be punished severely.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln replied, as he gently took down his hat to go home to\r\nsupper:\r\n\r\n"Considering the position of your pieces, judge, at the time of the\r\nupheaval, I think you have no reason to complain."\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN TAD GOT A SPANKING\r\n\r\nYet, indulgent as he was, there were some things Mr. Lincoln would not\r\nallow even his youngest child to do. An observer who saw the\r\nPresident-elect and his family in their train on the way to Washington\r\nto take the helm of State, relates that little Tad amused himself by\r\nraising the car window an inch or two and trying, by shutting it down\r\nsuddenly, to catch the fingers of the curious boys outside who were\r\nholding themselves up by their hands on the window sill of the car to\r\ncatch sight of the new President and his family.\r\n\r\nThe President-elect, who had to go out to the platform to make a little\r\nspeech to a crowd at nearly every stop, noticed Tad\'s attempts to pinch\r\nthe boys\' fingers. He spoke sharply to his son and commanded him to stop\r\nthat. Tad obeyed for a time, but his father, catching him at the same\r\ntrick again, leaned over, and taking the little fellow across his knee,\r\ngave him a good, sound spanking, exclaiming as he did so:\r\n\r\n"Why do you want to mash those boys\' fingers?"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE STORY OF BOB\'S LOSING THE INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was always lenient when the offense was against himself. The\r\nHon. Robert Todd Lincoln, the only living son of the great President,\r\ntells how the satchel containing his father\'s inaugural address was lost\r\nfor a time. Some writers have related the story of this loss, stating\r\nthat it all happened at Harrisburg, and telling how the President-elect\r\ndiscovered a bag like his own, and on opening it found only a pack of\r\ngreasy cards, a bottle of whisky and a soiled paper collar. Also that\r\nMr. Lincoln was "reminded" of a cheap, ill-fitting story--but none of\r\nthese things really took place.\r\n\r\nHere is the true story, as related to the writer by Robert Lincoln\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n"My father had confided to me the care of the satchel containing his\r\ninaugural address. It was lost for a little while during the stay of our\r\nparty at the old Bates House in Indianapolis. When we entered the hotel\r\nI set the bag down with the other luggage, which was all removed to a\r\nroom back of the clerk\'s desk.\r\n\r\n"As soon as I missed the valise I went right to father, in great\r\ndistress of mind. He ordered a search made. We were naturally much\r\nalarmed, for it was the only copy he had of his inaugural address, which\r\nhe had carefully written before leaving Springfield. Of course, he added\r\ncertain parts after reaching Washington. The missing bag was soon found\r\nin a safe place.\r\n\r\n"Instead of taking out the precious manuscript and stuffing it into his\r\nown pocket, father handed it right back to me, saying:\r\n\r\n"\'There, Bob, see if you can\'t take better care of it this time\'--and\r\nyou may be sure I was true to the trust he placed in me. Why, I hardly\r\nlet that precious gripsack get out of my sight during my waking hours\r\nall the rest of the long roundabout journey to Washington."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TERRIBLE LONELINESS AFTER WILLIE DIED\r\n\r\nThe death of Willie, who was nearly three years older than Tad, early in\r\n1862, during their first year in the White House, nearly broke his\r\nfather\'s heart. It was said that Mr. Lincoln never recovered from that\r\nbereavement. It made him yearn the more tenderly over his youngest son\r\nwho sadly missed the brother who had been his constant companion.\r\n\r\nIt was natural for a lad who was so much indulged to take advantage of\r\nhis freedom. Tad had a slight impediment in his speech which made the\r\nstreet urchins laugh at him, and even cabinet members, because they\r\ncould not understand him, considered him a little nuisance. So Tad,\r\nthough known as "the child of the nation," and greatly beloved and\r\npetted by those who knew him for a lovable affectionate child, found\r\nhimself alone in a class by himself, and against all classes of people.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNING THE HOSE ON HIGH OFFICIALS\r\n\r\nHe illustrated this spirit one day by getting hold of the hose and\r\nturning it on some dignified State officials, several army officers, and\r\nfinally on a soldier on guard who was ordered to charge and take\r\npossession of that water battery. Although that little escapade appealed\r\nto the President\'s sense of humor, for he himself liked nothing better\r\nthan to take generals and pompous officials down "a peg or two," Tad got\r\nwell spanked for the havoc he wrought that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAKING INTO A CABINET MEETING\r\n\r\nThe members of the President\'s cabinet had reason to be annoyed by the\r\nboy\'s frequent interruptions. He seemed to have the right of way\r\nwherever his father happened to be. No matter if Senator Sumner or\r\nSecretary Stanton was discussing some weighty matter of State or war, if\r\nTad came in, his father turned from the men of high estate to minister\r\nto the wants of his little boy. He did it to get rid of him, for of\r\ncourse he knew Tad would raise such a racket that no one could talk or\r\nthink till _his_ wants were disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXECUTIVE ORDER ON THE COMMISSARY DEPARTMENT FOR TAD AND HIS BOY\r\nFRIENDS\r\n\r\nA story is told of the boy\'s interruption of a council of war. This\r\nhabit of Tad\'s enraged Secretary Stanton, whose horror of the boy was\r\nsimilar to that of an elephant for a mouse. The President was giving his\r\nopinion on a certain piece of strategy which he thought the general in\r\nquestion might carry out--when a great noise was heard out in the hall,\r\nfollowed by a number of sharp raps on the door of the cabinet room.\r\n\r\nStrategy, war, everything was, for the moment forgotten by the\r\nPresident, whose wan face assumed an expression of unusual pleasure,\r\nwhile he gathered up his great, weary length from different parts of the\r\nroom as he had half lain, sprawling about, across and around his chair\r\nand the great table.\r\n\r\n"That\'s Tad," he exclaimed, "I wonder what that boy wants now." On his\r\nway to open the door, Mr. Lincoln explained that those knocks had just\r\nbeen adopted by the boy and himself, as part of the telegraph system,\r\nand that he was obliged to let the lad in--"for it wouldn\'t do to go\r\nback on the code now," he added, half in apology for permitting such a\r\nsudden break in their deliberations.\r\n\r\nWhen the door was opened, Tad, with flushed face and sparkling eyes,\r\nsprang in and threw his arms around his father\'s neck. The President\r\nstraightened up and embraced the boy with an expression of happiness\r\nnever seen on his face except while playing with his little son.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln turned, with the boy still in his arms, to explain that he\r\nand Tad had agreed upon this telegraphic code to prevent the lad from\r\nbursting in upon them without warning. The members of the cabinet looked\r\npuzzled or disgusted, as though they failed to see that several\r\nstartling raps could be any better than having Tad break in with a whoop\r\nor a wail, as had been the boy\'s custom.\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ON PETER FOR PIE\r\n\r\nThe boy raised a question of right. He had besieged Peter, the colored\r\nsteward, demanding that a dinner be served to several urchins he had\r\npicked up outside--two of whom were sons of soldiers. Peter had\r\nprotested that he "had other fish to fry" just then.\r\n\r\nThe President recognized at once that this was a case for diplomacy.\r\nTurning to various members of the cabinet, he called on each to\r\ncontribute from his store of wisdom, what would be best to do in a case\r\nof such vast importance. Tad looked on in wonder as his father set the\r\ngreat machinery of government in motion to make out a commissary order\r\non black Peter, which would force that astonished servant to deliver\r\ncertain pieces of pie and other desired eatables to Tad, for himself and\r\nhis boy friends.\r\n\r\nAt last an "order" was prepared by the Chief Executive of the United\r\nStates directing "The Commissary Department of the Presidential\r\nResidence to issue rations to Lieutenant Tad Lincoln and his five\r\nassociates, two of whom are the sons of soldiers in the Army of the\r\nPotomac."\r\n\r\nWith an expression of deep gravity and a solemn flourish, the President\r\ntendered this Commissary Order to the lieutenant, his son, saying as he\r\npresented the document:\r\n\r\n"I reckon Peter will _have_ to come to time now."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN, PATRIOT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no more sturdy little patriot in the whole country than\r\nLieutenant Tad Lincoln, "the child of the nation," nor had the President\r\nof the United States a more devoted admirer and follower than his own\r\nsmall son. A word from his father would melt the lad to tears and\r\nsubmission, or bring him out of a nervous tantrum with his small round\r\nface wreathed with smiles, and a chuckling in his throat of "Papa-day,\r\nmy papa-day!" No one knew exactly what the boy meant by papa-day. It was\r\nhis pet name for the dearest man on earth, and it was his only way of\r\nexpressing the greatest pleasure his boyish heart was able to hold. It\r\nwas the "sweetest word ever heard" by the war-burdened, crushed and\r\nsorrowing soul of the broken-hearted President of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln took his youngest son with him everywhere--on his great\r\nmission to Fortress Monroe, and they--"the long and the short of it,"\r\nthe soldiers said--marched hand in hand through the streets of fallen\r\nRichmond. The understanding between the man and the boy was so complete\r\nand sacred, that some acts which seemed to outsiders absurd and\r\nill-fitting, became perfectly right and proper when certain unknown\r\nfacts were taken into account.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAVING THE "STARS AND BARS" OUT OF A WHITE HOUSE WINDOW\r\n\r\nFor instance, one night, during an enthusiastic serenade at the White\r\nHouse, after a great victory of the northern armies, when the President\r\nhad been out and made a happy speech in response to the congratulations\r\nhe had received, everybody was horrified to see the Confederate "Stars\r\nand Bars" waving frantically from an upper window with shouts followed\r\nby shrieks as old Edward, the faithful colored servant, pulled in the\r\nflag and the boy who was guilty of the mischief.\r\n\r\n"That was little Tad!" exclaimed some one in the crowd. Many laughed,\r\nbut some spectators thought the boy ought to be punished for such a\r\ntreasonable outbreak on the part of a President\'s boy in a soldier\'s\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n"If he don\'t know any better than that," said one man, "he should be\r\ntaught better. It\'s an insult to the North and the President ought to\r\nstop it and apologize, too."\r\n\r\n\r\n"BOYS IN BLUE" AND "BOYS IN GRAY"\r\n\r\nBut little Tad understood his father\'s spirit better than the crowd did.\r\nHe knew that the President\'s love was not confined to "the Boys in\r\nBlue," but that his heart went out also to "the Boys in Gray." The\r\nsoldiers were all "boys" to him. They knew he loved them. They said\r\namong themselves: "He cares for us. He takes our part. We will fight for\r\nhim; yes, we will die for him."\r\n\r\nAnd a large part of the common soldier\'s patriotism was this\r\nheart-response of "the boys" to the great "boy" in the White House. That\r\nwas the meaning of their song as they trooped to the front at his call:\r\n\r\n        "We are coming, Father Abraham;\r\n         Three hundred thousand more."\r\n\r\nLittle Tad saw plenty of evidences of his father\'s love for the younger\r\nsoldiers--the real boys of the army. Going always with the President, he\r\nhad heard his "Papa-day" say of several youths condemned to be shot for\r\nsleeping at their post or some like offense:\r\n\r\n"That boy is worth more above ground than under;" or, "A live boy can\r\nserve his country better than a dead one."\r\n\r\n"Give the boys a chance," was Abraham Lincoln\'s motto. He hadn\'t had\r\nmuch of a chance himself and he wanted all other boys to have a fair\r\nshow. His own father had been too hard with him, and he was going to\r\nmake it up to all the other boys he could reach. This passion for doing\r\ngood to others began in the log cabin when he had no idea he could ever\r\nbe exercising his loving kindness in the Executive Mansion--the Home of\r\nthe Nation. "With malice toward none, with charity for all," was the\r\nrule of his life in the backwoods as well as in the National Capital.\r\n\r\nAnd "the Boys in Gray" were his "boys," too, but they didn\'t understand,\r\nso they had wandered away--they were a little wayward, but he would win\r\nthem back. The great chivalrous South has learned, since those bitter,\r\nruinous days, that Abraham Lincoln was the best friend the South then\r\nhad in the North. Tad had seen his father show great tenderness to all\r\nthe "boys" he met in the gray uniform, but the President had few\r\nopportunities to show his tenderness to the South--though there was a\r\nsecret pigeonhole in his desk stuffed full of threats of assassination.\r\nHe was not afraid of death--indeed, he was glad to die if it would do\r\nhis "boys" and the country any good. But it hurt him deep in his heart\r\nto know that some of his beloved children misunderstood him so that they\r\nwere willing to kill him!\r\n\r\nIt was no one\'s bullet which made Abraham Lincoln a martyr. All his life\r\nhe had shown the spirit of love which was willing to give his very life\r\nif it could save or help others.\r\n\r\nAll these things little Tad could not have explained, but they were\r\ninbred into the deep understanding of the big father and the small son\r\nwho were living in the White House as boys together.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. LINCOLN\'S LAST SPEECH AND HOW TAD HELPED\r\n\r\nA few days after the war ended at Appomattox, a great crowd came to the\r\nWhite House to serenade the President. It was Tuesday evening, April 11,\r\n1865. Mr. Lincoln had written a short address for the occasion. The\r\ntimes were so out of joint and every word was so important that the\r\nPresident could not trust himself to speak off-hand.\r\n\r\nA friend stepped out on the northern portico with him to hold the candle\r\nby which Mr. Lincoln was to read his speech. Little Tad was with his\r\nfather, as usual, and when the President had finished reading a page of\r\nhis manuscript he let it flutter down, like a leaf, or a big white\r\nbutterfly, for Tad to catch. When the pages came too slowly the boy\r\npulled his father\'s coat-tail, piping up in a muffled, excited tone:\r\n\r\n"Give me \'nother paper, Papa-day."\r\n\r\nTo the few in the front of the crowd who witnessed this little by-play\r\nit seemed ridiculous that the President of the United States should\r\nallow any child to behave like that and hamper him while delivering a\r\ngreat address which would wield a national, if not world-wide influence.\r\nBut little Tad did not trouble his father in the least. It was a part of\r\nthe little game they were constantly playing together.\r\n\r\nThe address opened with these words:\r\n\r\n        "FELLOW-CITIZENS: We meet this evening not in\r\n        sorrow, but gladness of heart. The evacuation\r\n        of Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender\r\n        of the principal insurgent army (at Appomattox)\r\n        give hope of a righteous and speedy peace whose\r\n        joyous expression cannot be restrained. In the\r\n        midst of this, however, He from whom all\r\n        blessings flow must not be forgotten. A call\r\n        for national thanksgiving is being prepared and\r\n        will be duly promulgated."\r\n\r\n\r\n"GIVE US \'DIXIE,\' BOYS!"\r\n\r\nThen he went on outlining a policy of peace and friendship toward the\r\nSouth--showing a spirit far higher and more advanced than that of the\r\nlistening crowd. On concluding his address and bidding the assembled\r\nmultitude good night, he turned to the serenading band and shouted\r\njoyously:\r\n\r\n"Give us \'Dixie,\' boys; play \'Dixie.\' We have a right to that tune now."\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence. Some of the people gasped, as they had\r\ndone when they saw Tad waving the Confederate flag at the window. But\r\nthe band, loyal even to a mere whim (as they then thought it) of "Father\r\nAbraham," started the long-forbidden tune, and the President, bowing,\r\nretired, with little Tad, within the White House. Those words, "Give us\r\n\'Dixie,\' boys," were President Lincoln\'s last public utterance.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Lincoln came in through the door after speaking to the crowd,\r\nMrs. Lincoln--who had been, with a group of friends, looking on from\r\nwithin--exclaimed to him:\r\n\r\n"You must not be so careless. Some one could easily have shot you while\r\nyou were speaking there--and you know they are threatening your life!"\r\n\r\nThe President smiled at his wife, through a look of inexpressible pain\r\nand sadness, and shrugged his great shoulders, but "still he answered\r\nnot a word."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEPARATION OF THE TWO "BOYS"\r\n\r\nAt a late hour Good Friday night, that same week, little Tad came in\r\nalone at a basement door of the White House from the National Theater,\r\nwhere he knew the manager, and some of the company, had made a great pet\r\nof him. He had often gone there alone or with his tutor. How he had\r\nheard the terrible news from Ford\'s Theater is not known, but he came up\r\nthe lower stairway with heartrending cries like a wounded animal.\r\nSeeing Thomas Pendel, the faithful doorkeeper, he wailed from his\r\nbreaking heart:\r\n\r\n"Tom Pen, Tom Pen, they have killed Papa-day! They have killed my\r\nPapa-day!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the funeral the little fellow was more lonely than ever. It was\r\nhard to have his pony burned up in the stable. It was harder still to\r\nlose Brother Willie, his constant companion, and now his mother was\r\ndesperately ill, and his father had been killed. Tad, of course, could\r\nnot comprehend why any one could be so cruel and wicked as to wish to\r\nmurder his darling Papa-day, who loved every one so!\r\n\r\nHe wandered through the empty rooms, aching with loneliness, murmuring\r\nsoftly to himself:\r\n\r\n"Papa-day, where\'s my Papa-day. I\'m tired--tired of playing alone. I\r\nwant to play together. Please, Papa-day, come back and play with your\r\nlittle Tad."\r\n\r\nYoung though he was he could not sleep long at night. His sense of\r\nloneliness penetrated his dreams. Sometimes he would chuckle and gurgle\r\nin an ecstacy, as he had done when riding on his father\'s back, romping\r\nthrough the stately rooms. He would throw his arm about the neck of the\r\ndoorkeeper or lifeguard who had lain down beside him to console the boy\r\nand try to get him to sleep. When the man spoke to comfort him, Tad\r\nwould find out his terrible mistake, that his father was not with him.\r\n\r\nThen he would wail again in the bitterness of his disappointment:\r\n\r\n"Papa-day, where\'s my Papa-day?"\r\n\r\n"Your papa\'s gone \'way off"--said his companion, his voice breaking with\r\nemotion--"gone to heaven."\r\n\r\nTad opened his eyes wide with wonder. "Is Papa-day happy in heaven?" he\r\nasked eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I\'m sure he\'s happy there, Taddie dear; now go to sleep."\r\n\r\n"Papa-day\'s happy. I\'m glad--_so_ glad!"--sighed the little boy--"for\r\nPapa-day never was happy here."\r\n\r\nThen he fell into his first sweet sleep since that terrible night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n"GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE"\r\n\r\nThe fond-hearted little fellow went abroad with his mother a few years\r\nafter the tragedy that broke both their lives. By a surgical operation,\r\nand by struggling manfully, he had corrected the imperfection in his\r\nspeech. But the heart of little Tad had been broken. While still a lad\r\nhe joined his fond father in the Beyond.\r\n\r\n"Give the boys a chance," had amounted to a passion with Abraham\r\nLincoln, yet through great wickedness and sad misunderstandings his own\r\nlittle son was robbed of this great boon. Little Tad had been denied the\r\none chance he sorely needed for his very existence. For this, as for all\r\nthe inequities the great heart of the White House was prepared. His\r\nspirit had shone through his whole life as if in letters of living fire:\r\n\r\n"With malice toward none; with charity for all."\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALTEMUS BOOKS\r\n\r\n        The Best and Least Expensive Books\r\n        for Twentieth Century Boys and Girls\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS FOR BOYS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS SERIES\r\n\r\nBy H.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\r\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\r\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\ncollection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\r\n"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\r\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\r\nproperty infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\r\ncomputer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\r\nyour equipment.\r\n\r\n1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right\r\nof Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\r\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\r\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\r\nfees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\r\nLIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\r\nPROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\r\nTRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\r\nLIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\r\nINCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\nDAMAGE.\r\n\r\n1.F.3.

If you\r\nreceived the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with\r\nyour written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with\r\nthe defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a\r\nrefund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity\r\nproviding it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to\r\nreceive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy\r\nis also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\r\nopportunities to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\r\nin paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you \'AS-IS\' WITH NO OTHER\r\nWARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\r\n\r\n1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied\r\nwarranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.\r\nIf any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the\r\nlaw of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be\r\ninterpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by\r\nthe applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any\r\nprovision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\r\n\r\n1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\r\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\r\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\r\nwith this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\r\npromotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\r\nharmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\r\nthat arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\r\nor cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nwork, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\r\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\'s web site and official\r\npage at http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
