Burgess\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CAUSE OF WILD LIFE IN AMERICA, ESPECIALLY THE MAMMALS MANY OF WHICH ARE\r\nSERIOUSLY THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION, THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThe cordial reception given the Burgess Bird Book for Children,\r\ntogether with numerous letters to the author asking for information\r\non the habits and characteristics of many of the mammals of\r\nAmerica, led to the preparation of this volume. It is offered\r\nmerely as an introduction to the four-footed friends, little and\r\nbig, which form so important a part of the wild life of the United\r\nStates and Canada.\r\n\r\nThere has been no attempt to describe or classify sub-species.\r\nThat is for the scientist and student with specific interests.\r\nThe purpose of this book is to acquaint the reader with the\r\nlarger groups--orders, families, and divisions of the latter,\r\nso that typical representatives may be recognized and their\r\nhabits understood.\r\n\r\nInstead of the word mammal, the word animal has been used\r\nthroughout as having a better defined meaning to the average\r\nchild.  A conscientious effort to avoid technical terms and\r\ndescriptions has been made that there may be nothing to confuse\r\nthe young mind. Clarity and simplicity have been the objects\r\nkept constantly in view.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the utmost care to be accurate in the smallest\r\ndetails has been exercised. To this end the works of leading\r\nauthorities on American mammals have been carefully consulted\r\nand compared. No statements which are not confirmed by two or\r\nmore naturalists of recognized standing have been made.\r\n\r\nIn this research work the writings of Audubon and Bachman, Dr. E.W.\r\nNeson, Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Dr. W.T. Hornaday, Ernest Thompson Seton\r\nand others, together with the bulletins of the Biological Survey of\r\nthe Department of Agriculture at Washington, have been of the\r\ngreatest value. I herewith acknowledge my debt to these.\r\n\r\nWhatever the text may lack in clearness of description will be\r\namply compensated for by the wonderful drawings in color and\r\nblack-an-white by Mr. Louis Agassiz Fuertes, the artist-naturalist,\r\nwhose hearty cooperation has been a source of great help to me.\r\nThese drawings were made especially for this book and add in no\r\nsmall degree to such value as it may possess.\r\n\r\nIf the reading of these pages shall lead even a few to an active\r\ninterest in our wild animals, stimulating a desire to preserve\r\nand protect a priceless heritage from the past which a heedless\r\npresent threatens through wanton and reckless waste to deny the\r\nfuture, the labor will have been well worth while.\r\n\r\nOnly through intimate acquaintance may understanding of the animals\r\nin their relations to each other and to man be attained.  To serve\r\nas a medium for this purpose this book has been written.  As such\r\nI offer it to the children of America, conscious of its\r\nshortcomings yet hopeful that it will prove of some value in\r\nacquainting them with their friends and mine--the animals of field\r\nand wood, of mountain and desert, in the truest sense the first\r\ncitizens of America.\r\n                                   THORNTON W.

"It is lucky for you that you were not one jump\r\nfarther away from this hole."\r\n\r\nPeter, safe inside that hole, didn\'t have a word to say, or, if he\r\ndid, he didn\'t have breath enough to say it.  It was quite true\r\nthat if he had been one jump farther from that hole, Reddy Fox\r\nwould have caught him.  As it was, the hairs on Peter\'s funny\r\nwhite tail actually had tickled Reddy\'s back as Peter plunged\r\nfrantically through the root-bound entrance to that hole.  It\r\nhad been the narrowest escape Peter had had for a long, long time.\r\nYou see, Reddy Fox had surprised Peter nibbling sweet clover on the\r\nbank of the Smiling Pond, and it had been a lucky thing for Peter\r\nthat that hole, dug long ago by Johnny Chuck\'s grandfather, had\r\nbeen right where it was.  Also, it was a lucky thing that old\r\nMr. Chuck had been wise enough to make the entrance between\r\nthe  roots of that tree in such a way that it could not be\r\ndug any larger.\r\n\r\nReddy Fox was too shrewd to waste any time trying to dig it larger.\r\nHe knew there wasn\'t room enough for him to get between those roots.\r\nSo, after trying to make Peter as uncomfortable as possible by\r\ntelling him what he, Reddy, would do to him when he did catch him,\r\nReddy trotted off across the Green Meadows.  Peter remained where\r\nhe was for a long time. When he was quite sure that it was safe to\r\ndo so, he crept out and hurried, lipperty-lipperty-lip, up to the\r\nOld Orchard.  He felt that that would be the safest place for him,\r\nbecause there were ever so many hiding places in the old stone wall\r\nalong the edge of it.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter reached the Old Orchard, who should he see but Jenny\r\nWren.  Jenny had arrived that very morning from the Sunny South\r\nwhere she had spent the winter.  "Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut!"\r\nexclaimed Jenny as soon as she saw Peter.  "If here isn\'t Peter\r\nRabbit himself!  How did you manage to keep out of the clutches\r\nof Reddy Fox all the long winter?"\r\n\r\nPeter chuckled.  "I didn\'t have much trouble with Reddy during\r\nthe winter," said he, "but this very morning he so nearly caught\r\nme that it is a wonder that my hair is not snow white from fright."\r\nThen he told Jenny all about his narrow escape.  "Had it not been\r\nfor that handy hole of Grandfather Chuck, I couldn\'t possibly\r\nhave escaped," concluded Peter.\r\n\r\nJenny Wren cocked her pert little head on one side, and her sharp\r\nlittle eyes snapped.  "Why don\'t you learn to swim, Peter, like\r\nyour cousin down in the Sunny South?" she demanded.  "If he had\r\nbeen in your place, he would simply have plunged into the Smiling\r\nPool and laughed at Reddy Fox."\r\n\r\nPeter sat bolt upright with his eyes very wide open.  In them was\r\na funny look of surprise as he stared up at Jenny Wren.  "What are\r\nyou talking about, Jenny Wren?" he demanded.  "Don\'t you know that\r\nnone of the Rabbit family swim unless it is to cross the Laughing\r\nBrook when there is no other way of getting to the other side, or\r\nwhen actually driven into the water by an enemy from whom there is\r\nno other escape?  I can swim a little if I have to, but you don\'t\r\ncatch me in the water when I can stay on land.  What is more, you\r\nwon\'t find any other members of my family doing such a thing."\r\n\r\n"Tut, tut, tut, tut, Peter!" exclaimed Jenny Wren in her sharp,\r\nscolding voice.  "Tut, tut, tut, tut!  For a fellow who has been\r\nso curious about the ways of his feathered neighbors, you know\r\nvery little about your own family.  If I were in your place I\r\nwould learn about my own relatives before I became curious about\r\nmy neighbors.  How many relatives have you, Peter?"\r\n\r\n"One," replied Peter promptly, "my big cousin, Jumper the Hare."\r\n\r\nJenny Wren threw back her head and laughed and laughed and laughed.\r\nIt was a most irritating and provoking laugh.  Finally Peter began\r\nto lose patience.  "What are you laughing at?" he demanded crossly.\r\n"You know very well that Jumper the Hare is the only cousin I have."\r\n\r\nJenny Wren laughed harder that ever.\r\n\r\n"Peter!" she gasped.  "Peter, you will be the death of me.  Why,\r\ndown in the Sunny South, where I spent the winter, you have a\r\ncousin who is more closely related to you than Jumper the Hare.\r\nAnd what is more, he is almost as fond of the water as Jerry\r\nMuskrat.  He was called the Marsh Rabbit or Marsh Hare, and many a\r\ntime I have watched him swimming about by the hour."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it!" declared Peter angrily.  "I don\'t believe a\r\nword of it.  You are simply trying to fool me, Jenny Wren.  There\r\nnever was a Rabbit and there never will be a Rabbit who would go\r\nswimming for the fun of it.  I belong to the Cottontail branch of\r\nthe Hare family, and it is a fine family if I do say so.  My\r\ncousin Jumper is a true Hare, and the only difference between us\r\nis that he is bigger, has longer legs and ears, changes the color\r\nof his coat in winter, and seldom, if ever, goes into holes in\r\nthe ground.  The idea of trying to tell me I don\'t know about my\r\nown relatives."\r\n\r\nJenny Wren suddenly became sober.  "Peter," said she very earnestly,\r\n"take my advice and go to school to Old Mother Nature for awhile.\r\nWhat I have told you is true, every word of it.  You have a cousin\r\ndown in the Sunny South who spends half his time in the water.\r\nWhat is more, I suspect that you and Jumper have other relatives\r\nof whom you\'ve never heard.  Such ignorance would be laughable if\r\nit were not to be pitied.  This is what comes of never having\r\ntraveled.  Go to school to Old Mother Nature for a while, Peter.\r\nIt will pay you."  With this, Jenny Wren flew away to hunt for\r\nMr. Wren that they might decide where to make their home for\r\nthe summer.\r\n\r\nPeter tried to believe that what Jenny Wren had told him was nothing\r\nbut a story, but do what he would, he couldn\'t rid himself of a\r\nlittle doubt.  He tried to interest himself in the affairs of the\r\nother little people of Old Orchard, but it was useless.  That little\r\ndoubt kept growing and growing.  Could it be possible that Jenny\r\nWren had spoken the truth?  Could it be that he really didn\'t\r\nknow what relatives he had or anything about them?  Of course Old\r\nMother Nature could tell him all he wanted to know.  And he knew\r\nthat whatever she might tell him would be true.\r\n\r\nFinally that growing doubt, together with the curiosity which has\r\nled poor Peter to do so many queer things, proved too much for him\r\nand he started for the Green Forest to look for Old Mother Nature.\r\nIt didn\'t take long to find her.  She was very busy, for there is\r\nno time in all the year when Old Mother Nature has quite so much\r\nto do as in the spring.\r\n\r\n"If you please, Old Mother Nature," said Peter timidly but very\r\npolitely, "I\'ve some questions I want to ask you."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature\'s eyes twinkled in a kindly way.  "All right,\r\nPeter," she replied.  "I guess I can talk and work at the same\r\ntime.  What is it you want to know?"\r\n\r\n"I want to know if it is true that there are any other members of\r\nthe Rabbit and the Hare family besides my big cousin, Jumper, who\r\nlives here in the Green Forest, and myself."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature\'s eyes twinkled more than ever.  "Why, of course,\r\nPeter," she replied.  "There are several other members.  You ought\r\nto know that.  But then, I suppose you don\'t because you never\r\nhave traveled.  It is surprising how little some folks know about\r\nthe very things they ought to know most about."\r\n\r\nPeter looked very humble and as if he felt a little bit foolish.\r\n"Is--is--is it true that way down in the Sunny South I have a\r\ncousin who loves to spend his time in the water?" stammered Peter.\r\n\r\n"It certainly is, Peter," replied Old Mother Nature.  "He is called\r\nthe Marsh Rabbit, and he is more nearly your size, and looks more\r\nlike you, than any of your other cousins."\r\n\r\nPeter gulped as if he were swallowing something that went down\r\nhard.  "That is what Jenny Wren said, but I didn\'t believe her,"\r\nreplied Peter meekly.  "She said she had often watched him\r\nswimming about like Jerry Muskrat."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature nodded.  "Quite true.  Quite true," said she.\r\n"He is quite as much at home in the water as on land, if anything\r\na little more so.  He is one member the family who takes to the\r\nwater, and he certainly does love it.  Is there anything else you\r\nwant to know, Peter?"\r\n\r\nPeter shifted about uneasily and hesitated.  "What is it, Peter?"\r\nasked Old Mother Nature kindly.  "There is nothing in the Great\r\nWorld equal to knowledge, and if I can add to your store of it I\r\nwill be very glad to."\r\n\r\nPeter took heart.  "If--if you please, Mother Nature, I would like\r\nto learn all about my family.  May come to school to you every day?"\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed right out.  "Certainly you may go to\r\nschool to me, old Mr. Curiosity," said she.  "It is a good idea;\r\na very good idea.  I\'m very busy, as you can see, but I\'m never\r\ntoo busy to teach those who really want to learn.  We\'ll have a\r\nlesson here every morning just at sun-up.  I can\'t be bothered\r\nany more to-day, because it is late.  Run along home to the dear\r\nOld Briar-patch and think up some questions to ask me to-morrow\r\nmorning.  And, by the way, Peter, I will ask YOU some questions.\r\nFor one thing I shall ask you to tell me all you know about your\r\nown family.  Now scamper along and be here to-morrow morning\r\nat sun-up."\r\n\r\n"May I bring my cousin, Jumper the Hare, if he wants to come?"\r\nasked Peter, as he prepared to obey Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Bring him along and any one else who wants to learn," replied Old\r\nMother Nature kindly.\r\n\r\nPeter bade her good-by in his most polite manner and then scampered\r\nas fast as he could go, lipperty-lipperty-lip, to the dear Old\r\nBriar-patch.  There he spent the remainder of the day thinking up\r\nquestions and also trying to find out how much he really did know\r\nabout his own family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II  Peter and Jumper go to School\r\n\r\nHardly had jolly, round, red Mr. Sun thrown off his rosy blankets\r\nand begun his daily climb up in the blue, blue sky when Peter\r\nRabbit and his cousin, Jumper the Hare, arrived at the place in\r\nthe Green Forest where Peter had found Old Mother Nature the day\r\nbefore.  She was waiting for them, ready to begin the first lesson.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you are so prompt," said she.  "Promptness is one of\r\nthe most important things in life.  Now I am very, very busy these\r\ndays, as you know, so we will begin school at once.  Before either\r\nof you ask any questions, I am going to ask some myself.  Peter,\r\nwhat do you look like?  Where do you live?  What do you eat?  I\r\nwant to find out just how much you really know about yourself."\r\n\r\nPeter scratched one ear with a long hind foot and hesitated as\r\nif he didn\'t know just how to begin.  Old Mother Nature waited\r\npatiently.  Finally Peter began rather timidly.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said he, "the only way I know how I look is by the\r\nway the other members of my family look, for I\'ve never seen\r\nmyself.  I suppose in a way I look like all the rest of the Rabbit\r\nfamily.  I have long hind legs and short front ones.  I suppose\r\nthis is so I can make long jumps when I am in a hurry."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature nodded, and Peter, taking courage, continued.  "My\r\nhind legs are stout and strong, but my front ones are rather weak.\r\nI guess this is because I do not have a great deal of use for them,\r\nexcept for running.  My coat is a sort of mixture of brown and gray,\r\nmore brown in summer and more gray in winter.  My ears are longer for\r\nmy size than are those of most animals, but really not very long after\r\nall, not nearly as long for my size as my cousin Jumper\'s are for his\r\nsize.  My tail doesn\'t amount to much because it is so short that it\r\nis hardly worth calling a tail.  It is so short I carry it straight\r\nup.  It is white like a little bunch of cotton, and I suppose that\r\nthat is why I am called a Cottontail Rabbit, though I have heard that\r\nsome folks  call me a Gray Rabbit and others a Bush Rabbit.  I guess\r\nI\'m  called Bush Rabbit because I like bushy country in which to live."\r\n\r\n"I live in the dear Old Briar-patch and just love it.  It is a\r\nmass of bushes and bramble-tangles and is the safest place I know\r\nof.  I have cut little paths all through it just big enough for\r\nMrs. Peter and myself.  None of our enemies can get at us there,\r\nexcepting Shadow the Weasel or Billy Mink.  I have a sort of nest\r\nthere where I spend my time when I am not running about.  It is\r\ncalled a form and I sit in it a great deal."\r\n\r\n"In summer I eat clover, grass and other green things, and I just\r\nlove to get over into Farmer Brown\'s garden.  In winter I have to\r\ntake what I can get, and this is mostly bark from young trees,\r\nbuds and tender twigs of bushes, and any green plants I can find\r\nunder the snow.  I can run fast for a short distance, but only\r\nfor a short distance.  That is why I like thick brush and\r\nbramble-tangles.  There I can dodge.  I don\'t know any one who can beat\r\nme at dodging.  If Reddy Fox or Bowser the Hound surprises me away from\r\nthe dear Old Briar-patch I run for the nearest hollow log or hole in the\r\nground.  Sometimes in summer I dig a hole for myself, but not often.  It\r\nis much easier to use a hole somebody else has dug.  When I want to\r\nsignal my friends I thump the ground with my hind feet.  Jumper does the\r\nsame thing.  I forgot to say I don\'t like water."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled.  "You are thinking of that cousin of\r\nyours, the Marsh Rabbit who lives way down in the Sunny South,"\r\nsaid she.\r\n\r\nPeter looked a wee bit foolish and admitted that he was. Jumper\r\nthe Hare was all interest at once.  You see, he had never heard\r\nof this cousin.\r\n\r\n"That was a very good account of yourself, Peter," said Old Mother\r\nNature.  "Now take a look at your cousin, Jumper the Hare, and\r\ntell me how he differs from you."\r\n\r\nPeter took a long look at Jumper, and then, as before, scratched\r\none ear with a long hind foot.  "In the first place," said he,\r\n"Jumper is considerably bigger than I.  He has very long hind legs\r\nand his ears are very long.  In summer he wears a brown coat, but\r\nin winter he is all white but the tips of those long ears, and\r\nthose are black.  Because his coat changes so, he is called the\r\nvarying Hare.  He likes the Green Forest where the trees grow\r\nclose together, especially those places where there are a great\r\nmany young trees.  He\'s the biggest member of our family.  I\r\nguess that\'s all I know about Cousin Jumper."\r\n\r\n"That is very good, Peter, as far as it goes," said Old Mother\r\nNature.  "You have made only one mistake.  Jumper is not the\r\nbiggest of his family."\r\n\r\nBoth Peter and Jumper opened their eyes very wide with surprise.\r\n"Also," continued Old Mother Nature, "you forgot to mention the\r\nfact that Jumper never hides in hollow logs and holes in the\r\nground as you do.  Why don\'t you, Jumper?"\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t feel safe there," replied Jumper rather timidly.  "I\r\ndepend on my long legs for safety, and the way I can dodge around\r\ntrees and bushes.  I suppose Reddy Fox may be fast enough to catch\r\nme in the open, but he can\'t do it where I can dodge around trees\r\nand bushes.  That is why I stick to the Green Forest.  If you please,\r\nMother Nature, what is this about a cousin who likes to swim?"\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature\'s eyes twinkled.  "We\'ll get to that later on,"\r\nsaid she.  "Now, each of you hold up a hind foot and tell me what\r\ndifference you see."\r\n\r\nPeter and Jumper each held up a hind foot and each looked first at\r\nhis own and then at the other\'s.  "They look to me very much\r\nalike, only Jumper\'s is a lot longer and bigger than mine," said\r\nPeter.  Jumper nodded as if he agreed.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with your eyes?" demanded Old Mother Nature.\r\n"Don\'t you see that Jumper\'s foot is a great deal broader than\r\nyours, Peter, and that his toes are spread apart, while yours are\r\nclose together?"\r\n\r\nPeter and Jumper looked sheepish, for it was just as Old Mother\r\nNature had said.  Jumper\'s foot really was quite different from\r\nthat of Peter.  Peter\'s was narrow and slim.\r\n\r\n"That is a very important difference," declared Old Mother Nature.\r\n"Can you guess why I gave you those big feet, Jumper?"\r\n\r\nJumper slowly shook his head.  "Not unless it was to make me\r\ndifferent," said he.\r\n\r\n"I\'m surprised," said Old Mother Nature.  "Yes, indeed, I\'m\r\nsurprised.  You ought to know by this time that I never give\r\nanybody anything without a purpose.  What happens to those big\r\nfeet of yours in the winter, Jumper?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing that I know of, excepting that the hair grows out long\r\nbetween my toes," Jumper replied.\r\n\r\n"Exactly," snapped Old Mother Nature.  "And when the hair does this\r\nyou can travel over light snow without sinking in.  It is just as\r\nif you had snowshoes.  That is why you are often called a Snowshoe\r\nRabbit.  I gave you those big feet and make the hair grow out every\r\nwinter because I know that you depend on your legs to get away from\r\nyour enemies.  You can run over the deep snow where your enemies\r\nbreak through.  Peter, though he is small and lighter than you are,\r\ncannot go where you can.  But Peter doesn\'t need to depend always\r\non his legs to save his life.  There is one thing more that I want\r\nyou both to notice, and that is that you both have quite a lot of\r\nshort hairs on the soles of you feet.  That is where you differ\r\nfrom that cousin of yours down in the Sunny South.  He has only\r\na very few hairs on his feet.  That is so he can swim better."\r\n\r\n"If you please, Mother Nature, why is that cousin of ours so fond\r\nof the water?" piped up Peter.\r\n\r\n"Because," replied Old Mother Nature, "he lives in marshy country\r\nwhere there is a great deal of water.  He is very nearly the same\r\nsize as you, Peter, and looks very much like you.  But his legs\r\nare not quite so long, his ears are a little smaller, and his tail\r\nis brownish instead of white.  He is a poor runner and so in time\r\nof danger he takes to the water.  For that matter, he goes swimming\r\nfor pleasure.  The water is warm down there, and he dearly loves\r\nto paddle about in it.  If a Fox chases him he simply plunges into\r\nthe water and hides among the water plants with only his eyes and\r\nhis nose out of water."\r\n\r\n"Does he make his home in the water like Jerry Muskrat?" asked\r\nPeter innocently.\r\n\r\nMother Nature smiled and shook her head.  "Certainly not," she\r\nreplied.  "His home is on the ground.  His babies are born in a\r\nnest made just as Mrs. Peter makes her nest for your babies, and\r\nMrs. Jumper makes a nest for Jumper\'s babies.  It is made of grass\r\nand lined with soft fur which Mrs. Rabbit pulls from her own\r\nbreast, and it is very carefully hidden.  By the way, Peter how do\r\nyour babies differ from the babies of your Cousin Jumper?"\r\n\r\nPeter shook his head.  "I don\'t know," said he.  "My babies don\'t\r\nhave their eyes open when they are born, and they haven\'t any hair."\r\n\r\nJumper pricked up his long ears.  "What\'s that?" said he.\r\n"Why, my babies have their eyes open and have the dearest little\r\nfur coats!"\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature chuckled.  "That is the difference," said she.\r\n"I guess both of you have learned something."\r\n\r\n"You said a little while ago that Jumper isn\'t the biggest of our\r\nfamily," said Peter.  "If you please, who is?"\r\n\r\n"There are several bigger than Jumper," replied Old Mother Nature,\r\nand smiled as she saw the funny look of surprise on the faces of\r\nPeter and Jumper.  "There is one way up the Frozen North and there\r\nare two cousins way out in the Great West.  They are as much\r\nbigger than Jumper as Jumper is bigger than you, Peter.  But I\r\nhaven\'t time to tell you about them now.  If you really want to\r\nlearn about them, be here promptly at sun-up to-morrow morning.\r\nHello!  Here comes Reddy Fox, and he looks to me as if a good\r\nbreakfast would not come amiss.  Let me see what you have learned\r\nabout taking care of yourselves."\r\n\r\nPeter and Jumper gave one startled look in the direction Mother\r\nNature was pointing.  Sure enough, there was Reddy Fox.  Not far\r\naway was a hollow log.  Peter wasted no time in getting to it.\r\nIn fact, he left in such a hurry that he forgot to say good-by to\r\nOld Mother Nature.  But she didn\'t mind, for she quite understood\r\nPeter\'s feelings, and she laughed when she saw his funny little\r\nwhite tail disappear inside the hollow log.  As for Jumper, he\r\npromptly took to his long legs and disappeared with great bounds,\r\nReddy Fox racing after him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III  More of Peter\'s Long-Legged Cousins\r\n\r\nAt sun-up the next morning Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare were on\r\nhand promptly for their next lesson.  Old Mother Nature smiled as\r\nshe saw the eager curiosity shining in their eyes.  She didn\'t wait\r\nfor them to ask questions.  "Yesterday," said she, "I told you\r\nabout your water-loving cousin, the Marsh Rabbit.  You have another\r\nrelative down there in the Sunny South who is almost as fond of\r\nthe water.  Some folks call him the Swamp Rabbit.  Others call him\r\nthe Swamp Hare.  The latter is really the best name for him, because\r\nhe is a true Hare.  He lives in swamps instead of marshes, but he is\r\na splendid swimmer and fond of the water.  When he is chased by an\r\nenemy he makes for the nearest point or stream."\r\n\r\n"How big is he?" asked Jumper.\r\n\r\n"Just about your size, Jumper," replied Old Mother Nature.  "If\r\nanything, he is a little bit heavier.  But because his hair lies\r\nmuch smoother than yours, you probably would look a little bit\r\nbigger if you were sitting beside him.  As with his cousin, the\r\nMarsh Rabbit, the hair on his feet is thin.  His toes are rather\r\nlong and he can spread them widely, which is a great help in\r\nswimming.  He doesn\'t have to take to the water as his little\r\ncousin does, for he is a very good runner.  But he does take to it\r\nas the easiest way of getting rid of those who are chasing him.\r\nThe Marsh Rabbit and the Swamp Hare are the only members of your\r\nfamily in all the Great World who are fond of the water and who\r\nare at home in it.  Now, who shall I tell you about?"\r\n\r\n"Our biggest cousins," cried Peter and Jumper together.  "The ones\r\nyou told us yesterday are bigger than Jumper," added Peter.  "It\r\nis hard to believe that there can be any much bigger than he."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature\'s eyes twinkled.  "It is often hard to believe\r\nthings you know nothing about," said she.  "Compared with these\r\nother relatives, Jumper really isn\'t big at all.  He seems big to\r\nyou, Peter, but if he should meet his cousin, Snow White the Arctic\r\nHare, who lives way up in the Frozen North, I am quite sure Jumper\r\nwould feel small.  Snow White looks very much like Jumper in his\r\nwinter coat, for he is all white save the tips of his ears,\r\nwhich are black."\r\n\r\n"Does he wear a white coat all year round?" asked Peter eagerly.\r\n\r\n"When he lives so far north that there is snow and ice for most of\r\nthe year, he does," replied Old Mother Nature.  "But when he lives\r\nfar enough south for the snow to disappear for a little while in\r\nthe summer, he changes his white coat for one of gray."\r\n\r\n"But how can he live so far north that the snow and ice seldom melt?"\r\nasked Peter, looking very much puzzled.  "What can he find to eat?"\r\n\r\n"Even way up there there is moss growing under the snow.  And in the\r\nshort summer other plants grow.  During the long winter Snow White\r\ndigs down through the snow to get these.  He also eats the bark and\r\ntwigs of little stunted trees.  But big as he is, you have a cousin\r\nwho is still bigger, the biggest of all the family."\r\n\r\n"Who is he?" Jumper and Peter cried together.\r\n\r\n"He is called White-tailed Jack," replied Old Mother Nature.  "And\r\nhe lives chiefly on the great plains of the Northwest, though\r\nsometimes he is found in the mountains and forests.  He is sometimes\r\ncalled the Prairie Hare.  In winter his coat is white, but in\r\nsummer it is a light brown.  Summer or winter his tail is white,\r\nwherein he is much like you, Peter.  It is because of this that he\r\nis called White-tailed Jack."\r\n\r\n"Is his tail as short as mine?" asked Peter eagerly.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed right out.  "No, Peter," she replied.\r\n"It wouldn\'t be called a long tail by any other animal, but for a\r\nmember of your family it really is long, and when White-tailed\r\nJack is running he switches it from side to side.  His hind legs\r\nare very long and powerful, and he can make a single jump of twenty\r\nfeet without half trying.  Not even Old Man Coyote can catch him\r\nin a straightaway race.  You think Jumper\'s ears are long, Peter,\r\nbut they are short compared to the ears of White-tailed Jack.  Not\r\nonly are his ears long, but they are very big.  When he squats in\r\nhis form and lays his ears back they reach way over his shoulders.\r\nLike the other members of the Hare family he doesn\'t use holes in\r\nthe ground or hollow logs.  He trusts to his long legs and to his\r\nwonderful speed to escape from his enemies.  Among the latter are\r\nHowler the Wolf, Old Man Coyote, Eagles, Hawks and Owls.  He is\r\nso big that he would make five or six of you, Peter."\r\n\r\nPeter drew a long breath.  "It is dreadfully hard to believe that\r\nI can have a cousin as big as that," he exclaimed.  "But of course\r\nif you say it is so, it is so," he hastened to add.  "Have I any\r\nother cousins anywhere near as big?"\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature nodded.  "There are some others very like\r\nWhite-tailed Jack, only not quite as big," said she.  "They have\r\njust such long hind legs, and just such great ears, but their\r\ncoats are different, and they live on the great plains farther\r\nsouth.  Some of them live so far south that it is warm all the\r\nyear round.  One of these latter is Antelope Jack, whose home is\r\nin the Southwest."\r\n\r\n"Tell us about him," begged Peter.\r\n\r\n"To begin with," replied Old Mother Nature, "he is a member of the\r\nbig Jack Rabbit or Jack Hare branch of your family.  None of this\r\nbranch should be called a Rabbit.  All the members are first cousins\r\nto Jumper and are true Hares.  All have big ears, long, rather thin\r\nnecks, and long legs.  Even their front legs are comparatively long.\r\nAntelope Jack is probably next in size to White-tailed Jack.  Strange\r\nto say, although he lives where it is warm for most of the year, his\r\ncoat is very largely white.  His back is a yellowish-brown and so is\r\nhis throat.  But his sides are white.  The surprising thing about\r\nhim is that he has the power of making himself seem almost wholly\r\nwhite.  He can make the white hair spread out at will by means of\r\nsome special little muscles which I have given him, so that the\r\nwhite of his sides at times almost seems to meet on his back.  When\r\nhe does this in the sun it makes flashes of white which can be seen\r\na long way.  By means of this Antelope Jack and his friends can\r\nkeep track of each other when they are a long distance apart.  There\r\nis only one other animal who can flash signals in this way, and that\r\nis the Antelope of whom I will tell you some other time.  It is\r\nbecause Jack flashes signals in this way that he is called Antelope\r\nJack.  In his habits he is otherwise much like the other members of\r\nhis family.  He trusts to his long legs and his wonderful powers of\r\njumping to keep him out of danger.  He is not as well known as his\r\ncommoner cousin, plain Jack Rabbit.  Everybody knows Jack Rabbit."\r\n\r\nPeter shook his head.  "I don\'t," said he very meekly.\r\n\r\n"Then it is time you did," replied Old Mother Nature.  "If you had\r\never been in the Far West you would know him.  Everybody out there\r\nknows him.  He isn\'t quite as big as Antelope Jack but still he is\r\na big fellow.  He wears a brownish coat much like Jumper\'s, and\r\nthe tips of his long ears are black.  His tail is longer than\r\nJumper\'s, and when he runs he carries it down."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t carry mine down," Peter piped up.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed right out.  "True enough, Peter, true\r\nenough," said she.  "You couldn\'t if you wanted to.  It isn\'t long\r\nenough to carry any way but up.  Jack has more of a tail than you\r\nhave, just as he has longer legs.  My, how he can run!  He goes with\r\ngreat bounds and about every tenth bound he jumps very high.  This\r\nis so that he can get a good look around to watch out for enemies."\r\n\r\n"Who are his enemies?" asked Peter.\r\n\r\n"Foxes, Coyotes, Hawks, Eagles, Owls, Weasels, and men," replied\r\nOld Mother Nature.  "In fact, he has about as many enemies as\r\nyou have."\r\n\r\n"I suppose when you say men, you mean hunters," said Peter.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature nodded.  "Yes," said she, "I mean those who hunt\r\nhim for fun and those who hunt him to get rid of him."\r\n\r\nPeter pricked up his ears.  "What do they want to get rid of him\r\nfor.  What harm does he do?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"When he lives far away from the homes of men he does no harm,"\r\nreplied Old Mother Nature.  "But when he lives near the homes of\r\nmen he gets into mischief, just as you do when you visit Farmer\r\nBrown\'s garden."  Old Mother Nature looked very severe when she\r\nsaid this and Peter hung his head.\r\n\r\n"I know I ought to keep away from that garden," said Peter very\r\nmeekly, "but you have no idea what a temptation it is.  The things\r\nin that garden do taste so good."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature turned her head to hide the twinkle in her eyes.\r\nWhen she turned toward Peter again her face was severe as before.\r\n"That is no excuse, Peter Rabbit," said she.  "You should be\r\nsufficiently strong-minded not to yield to temptation.  Yielding\r\nto temptation is the cause of most of the trouble in this world.\r\nIt has made man an enemy to Jack Rabbit.  Jack just cannot keep\r\naway from the crops planted by men.  His family is very large, and\r\nwhen a lot of them get together in a field of clover or young wheat,\r\nor in a young orchard where the bark on the trees is tender and\r\nsweet, they do so much damage that the owner is hardly to be blamed\r\nfor becoming angry and seeking to kill them.  Yes, I am sorry to\r\nsay, Jack Rabbit becomes a terrible nuisance when he goes where\r\nhe has no business.  Now I guess you have learned sufficient about\r\nyour long-legged cousins.  I\'ve a great deal to do, so skip along\r\nhome, both of you."\r\n\r\n"If you please, Mother Nature, may we come again to-morrow?"\r\nasked Peter.\r\n\r\n"What for?" demanded Old Mother Nature.  "Haven\'t you learned enough\r\nabout your family?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Peter, "but there are lots and lots of things I\r\nwould like to know about other people.  If you please, I would\r\nlike to come to school to you every day.  You see, the more I\r\nlearn about my neighbors, the better able I will be to take care\r\nof myself."\r\n\r\n"All right, Mr. Curiosity," replied Old Mother Nature good-naturedly,\r\n"come again to-morrow morning.  I wouldn\'t for the world deny any one\r\nwho is really seeking for knowledge."\r\n\r\nSo Peter and Jumper politely bade her good-by and started for\r\ntheir homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV  Chatterer and Happy Jack Join\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit, on his way to school to Old Mother Nature, was trying\r\nto make up his mind about which of his neighbors he would ask.  He\r\nhad learned so many surprising things about his own family that he\r\nshrewdly suspected many equally surprising things were to be learned\r\nabout his neighbors.  But there were so many neighbors he couldn\'t\r\ndecide which one to ask about first.\r\n\r\nBut that matter was settled for him, and in a funny way.  Hardly\r\nhad he reached the edge of the Green Forest when he was hailed by a\r\nsharp voice.  "Hello, Peter Rabbit!" said this sharp voice.  "Where\r\nare you bound at this hour of the morning?  You ought to be heading\r\nfor home in the dear Old Briar-patch."\r\n\r\nPeter knew that voice the instant he heard it.  It was the voice of\r\nHappy Jack the Gray Squirrel.  Happy Jack was seated on the top of\r\nan old stump, eating a nut.  "I\'m going to school," replied Peter\r\nwith a great deal of dignity.\r\n\r\n"Going to school!  Ho, ho, ho!  Going to school!" exclaimed Happy\r\nJack.  "Pray tell me to whom you are going to school, and what for?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to school to Old Mother Nature," retorted Peter.  "I\'ve\r\nbeen going for several days, and so has my cousin, Jumper the Hare.\r\nWe\'ve learned a lot about our own family and now we are going to\r\nlearn about the other little people of the Green Forest and the\r\nGreen Meadows."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" exclaimed Happy Jack.  "Pooh! I know all about my own family,\r\nand I guess there isn\'t much worth knowing about my neighbors that\r\nI don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Is that so, Mr. Know-it-all," retorted Peter.  "I don\'t believe\r\nyou even know all your own cousins.  I thought I knew all mine, but\r\nI found I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"What are you fellows talking about?" asked another voice, a sharp\r\nscolding voice, and Chatterer the Red Squirrel jumped from one\r\ntree to another just above Peter\'s head.\r\n\r\n"Peter is trying to make me believe that I don\'t know as much as I\r\nmight about our own family," snapped Happy Jack indignantly.  "He\r\nis on his way to school to Old Mother Nature and has advised me to\r\njoin him.  Isn\'t that a joke?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe it is, and maybe it isn\'t," retorted Chatterer, who isn\'t\r\nthe best of friends with his cousin, Happy Jack.  "If I don\'t know\r\nas much about the Squirrel family as you do, may I never find another\r\nnut as long as I live.  But at that, I\'m not sure I know all there\r\nis to know.  I think it would be fun to go to school for a while.\r\nWhat do you say, Peter, if I go along with you?"\r\n\r\nPeter said that he thought it would be a very fine thing and that\r\nChatterer never would regret it.  Chatterer winked at his cousin,\r\nHappy Jack, and followed Peter, only of course, Chatterer kept in\r\nthe trees while Peter was on the ground.  Happy Jack hesitated a\r\nminute and then, curiosity becoming too much for him, he hastened\r\nafter the others.\r\n\r\n"Hello!" exclaimed Old Mother Nature, as Happy Jack and Chatterer\r\nappeared with Peter Rabbit.  "What are you frisky folks doing\r\nover here?"\r\n\r\nHappy Jack and Chatterer appeared to have lost their tongues,\r\nsomething very unusual for them, especially for Chatterer.  The\r\nfact is, in the presence of Old Mother Nature they felt bashful.\r\nPeter replied for them.  "They\'ve decided to come to school,\r\ntoo," said he.  "Happy Jack says he knows all about his own\r\nfamily, but he has come along to find out if he really does."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t take us long to find out," said Old Mother Nature softly\r\nand her eyes twinkled with amusement.  "How many cousins have\r\nyou, Happy Jack?"\r\n\r\nHappy Jack thought for a moment.  "Three," he replied, but he\r\ndidn\'t say it in a very positive way.  Peter chuckled to himself,\r\nfor he knew that already doubt was beginning to grow in Happy\r\nJack\'s mind.\r\n\r\n"Name them," commanded Old Mother Nature promptly.\r\n\r\n"Chatterer the Red Squirrel, Timmy the Flying Squirrel, and\r\nStriped Chipmunk," replied Happy Jack.\r\n\r\n"He\'s forgotten Rusty the Fox Squirrel," shouted Chatterer,\r\ndancing about gleefully.\r\n\r\nHappy Jack looked crestfallen and gave Chatterer an angry look.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Chatterer," said Old Mother Nature.  "Rusty is a\r\nvery important member of the Squirrel family.  Now suppose you\r\nname the others."\r\n\r\n"Wha--wha--what others?" stammered Chatterer.  "I don\'t know of\r\nany others."\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit hugged himself with glee as he watched the faces of\r\nHappy Jack and Chatterer.  "They don\'t know any more about their\r\nfamily than we did about ours," he whispered in one of the long\r\nears of Jumper the Hare.\r\n\r\nAs for Old Mother Nature, she smiled indulgently.  "Put on your\r\nthinking-caps, you two," said she.  "You haven\'t named half of\r\nthem.  You are not wholly to blame for that, for some of them you\r\nnever have seen, but there is one member of the Squirrel family\r\nwhom both of you know very well, yet whom neither of you named.\r\nPut on your thinking-caps."\r\n\r\nChatterer looked at Happy Jack, and Happy Jack looked at Chatterer,\r\nand each scratched his head.  Each wanted to be the first to think\r\nof that other cousin, for each was jealous of the other.  But though\r\nthey scratched and scratched their heads, they couldn\'t think who\r\nthat other cousin could be.  Old Mother Nature waited a few minutes\r\nbefore she told them.  Then, seeing that either they couldn\'t\r\nremember or didn\'t know, she said, "You didn\'t mention Johnny Chuck."\r\n\r\n"Johnny Chuck!" exclaimed Chatterer and Happy Jack together, and\r\nthe look of surprise on their faces was funny to see.  For that\r\nmatter, the looks on the faces of Peter Rabbit and Jumper the\r\nHare were equally funny.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature nodded.  "Johnny Chuck," she repeated.  "He is a\r\nmember of the Squirrel family.  He belongs to the Marmot branch,\r\nbut he is a Squirrel just the same.  He is one of your cousins."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a mighty funny looking Squirrel," said Chatterer, jerking\r\nhis tail as only he can.\r\n\r\n"That just shows your ignorance, Chatterer," replied Old Mother\r\nNature rather sharply.  "I\'m surprised at the ignorance of you\r\ntwo."  She looked first at Chatterer, than at Happy Jack.  "It is\r\nhigh time you came to school to me for a while.  You\'ve got a lot\r\nto learn.  For that matter, so have Peter and Jumper.  Now which\r\nof you can tell me what order you all belong to?"\r\n\r\nHappy Jack looked at Chatterer, Chatterer looked at Peter Rabbit,\r\nand Peter looked at Jumper the Hare.  On the face of each was such\r\na funny, puzzled expression that Old Mother Nature almost laughed\r\nright out.  Finally Peter Rabbit found his tongue.  "If you please,"\r\nsaid he, "I guess we don\'t know what you mean by an order."\r\n\r\n"I thought as much," said Old Mother Nature.  "I thought as much.\r\nIn the first place, the animals of the Great World are divided\r\ninto big groups or divisions, and then these groups are divided\r\ninto smaller groups, and these in turn into still smaller groups.\r\nHappy Jack and Chatterer belong to a group called the Squirrel\r\nfamily, and Peter and Jumper to a group called the Hare family.\r\nBoth of these families and several other families belong to a\r\nbigger group called an order, and this order is the order of\r\nGnawers, or Rodents."\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit fairly jumped up in the air, he was so excited.  "Then\r\nJumper and I must be related to Happy Jack and Chatterer," he cried.\r\n\r\n"In a way you are," replied Old Mother Nature.  "It isn\'t a very\r\nclose relationship, still you are related.  All of you are Rodents.\r\nSo are all the members of the Rat and Mouse family, the Beaver\r\nfamily, the Porcupine family, the Pocket Gopher family, the Pika\r\nfamily, and the Sewellel family."\r\n\r\nBy this time Peter\'s eyes looked as if they would pop right out of\r\nhis head.  "This is the first time I\'ve ever heard of some of those\r\nfamilies," said he.  "My, what a lot we have to learn!  Is it\r\nbecause all the members of all those families have teeth for gnawing\r\nthat they are all sort of related?"\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature looked pleased.  "Peter," said she, "I think you\r\nought to go to the head of the class.  That is just why.  All the\r\nmembers of all the families I have named belong to the same order,\r\nthe order of Rodents.  All the members have big, cutting, front\r\nteeth.  Animals without such teeth cannot gnaw.  Now, as you and\r\nJumper have learned about your family, it is the turn of Happy Jack\r\nand Chatterer to learn about their family.  Theirs is rather a large\r\nfamily, and it is divided into three groups, the first of which\r\nconsists of the true Squirrels, to which group both Happy Jack and\r\nChatterer belong.  The second group consists of the Marmots, and\r\nJohnny Chuck belongs to this.  The third group Timmy the Flying\r\nSquirrel has all to himself."\r\n\r\n"Where does Striped Chipmunk come in?" asked Chatterer.\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming to that," replied Old Mother Nature.  "The true Squirrels\r\nare divided into the Tree Squirrels, Rock Squirrels, and Ground\r\nSquirrels.  Of course Chatterer and Happy Jack are Tree Squirrels."\r\n\r\n"And Striped Chipmunk is a Ground Squirrel," interrupted Peter,\r\nlooking as if he felt very much pleased with his own smartness.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature shook her head.  "You are wrong this time,\r\nPeter," said she, and Peter looked as foolish as he felt.  "Striped\r\nChipmunk is a Rock Squirrel.  Seek Seek the Spermophile who lives\r\non the plains of the West and is often called Gopher Squirrel, is\r\nthe true Ground Squirrel.  Now I can\'t spend any more time with you\r\nlittle folks this morning, because I\'ve too much to do.  To-morrow\r\nmorning I shall expect Chatterer to tell me all about Happy Jack,\r\nand Happy Jack to tell me all about Chatterer.  Now scamper along,\r\nall of you, and think over what you have learned this morning."\r\n\r\nSo Peter and Jumper and Chatterer and Happy Jack thanked Old Mother\r\nNature for what she had told them and scampered away.  Peter headed\r\nstraight for the far corner of the Old Orchard where he was sure he\r\nwould find Johnny Chuck.  He couldn\'t get there fast enough, for he\r\nwanted to be the first to tell Johnny Chuck that he was a Squirrel.\r\nYou see he didn\'t believe that Johnny knew it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V  The Squirrels of the Trees\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit found Johnny Chuck sitting on his doorstep, sunning\r\nhimself.  Peter was quite out of breath because he had hurried so.\r\n"Do you know that you are a Squirrel, Johnny Chuck?" he panted.\r\n\r\nJohnny slowly turned his head and looked at Peter as if he thought\r\nPeter had suddenly gone crazy.  "What are you talking about, Peter\r\nRabbit?  I\'m not a Squirrel; I\'m a Woodchuck," he replied.\r\n\r\n"Just the same, you are a Squirrel," retorted Peter.  "The Woodchucks\r\nbelong to the Squirrel family.  Old Mother Nature says so, and if she\r\nsays so, it is so.  You\'d better join our school, Johnny Chuck, and\r\nlearn a little about your own relatives."\r\n\r\nJohnny Chuck blinked his eyes and for a minute or two couldn\'t find\r\na word to say.  He knew that if Peter were telling the truth as to\r\nwhat Old Mother Nature had said, it must be true that he was member\r\nof the Squirrel family.  But it was hard to believe.  "What is this\r\nschool?" he finally asked.\r\n\r\nPeter hastened to tell him.  He told Johnny all about what he and\r\nJumper the Hare had learned about their family, and all the\r\nsurprising things Old Mother Nature had told them about the\r\nSquirrel family, and he ended by again urging Johnny Chuck to\r\njoin the school and promised to call for Johnny the next morning.\r\n\r\nBut Johnny Chuck is lazy and does not like to go far from his own\r\ndoorstep, so when Peter called the next morning Johnny refused to\r\ngo, despite all Peter could say.  Peter didn\'t waste much time\r\narguing for he was afraid he would be late and miss something.\r\nWhen he reached the Green Forest he found his cousin, Jumper the\r\nHare, and Chatterer the Red Squirrel, and Happy Jack the Gray\r\nSquirrel, already there.  As soon as Peter arrived Old Mother\r\nNature began the morning lesson.\r\n\r\n"Happy Jack," said she, "you may tell us all you know about your\r\ncousin, Chatterer."\r\n\r\n"To begin with, he is the smallest of the Tree Squirrels," said\r\nHappy Jack.  "He isn\'t so very much bigger than Striped Chipmunk,\r\nand that means that he is less than half as big as myself.  His\r\ncoat is red and his waistcoat white; his tail is about two-thirds\r\nas long as his body and flat but not very broad.  Personally, I\r\ndon\'t think it is much of a tail."\r\n\r\nAt once Chatterer\'s quick temper flared up and he began to scold.\r\nBut Old Mother Nature silenced him and told Happy Jack to go on.\r\n"He spends more of his time in the trees than I do," continued\r\nHappy Jack, "and is especially fond of pine trees and other\r\ncone-bearing trees.  He likes the deeper parts of the Green Forest\r\nbetter than I do, though he seems to feel just as much at home on\r\nthe edge of the Green Forest, especially if it is near a farm where\r\nhe can steal corn."\r\n\r\nChatterer started to scold again but was silenced once more by Old\r\nMother Nature.  "I have to admit that Chatterer is thrifty,"\r\ncontinued Happy Jack, quite as if he hadn\'t been interrupted.\r\n"He is very fond of the seeds of cone-bearing trees.  He cuts the\r\ncones from the trees just before they are ripe.  Then they ripen\r\nand open on the ground, where he can get at the seeds easily.  He\r\noften has a number of store-houses and stores up cone seeds, acorns,\r\nnuts, and corn when he can get it.  He builds a nest of leaves and\r\nstrips of bark, sometimes in a hollow tree and sometimes high up\r\nin the branches of an evergreen tree.  He is a good jumper and\r\njumps from tree to tree.  He is a busybody and always poking his\r\nnose in where he has no business.  He steals my stores whenever he\r\ncan find them."\r\n\r\n"You do the same thing to me when you have the chance, which isn\'t\r\noften," sputtered Chatterer.\r\n\r\nHappy Jack turned his back to Chatterer and continued, "He doesn\'t\r\nseem to mind cold weather at all, as long as the sun shines.  His\r\nnoisy tongue is to be heard on the coldest days of winter.  He is\r\nthe sauciest, most impudent fellow of the Green Forest, and never\r\nso happy as when he is making trouble for others.  He sauces and\r\nscolds everybody he meets, and every time he opens his mouth he\r\njerks his tail.  He\'s quarrelsome.  Worse than that, in the spring\r\nwhen the birds are nesting, he turns robber.  He goes hunting\r\nfor nests and steals the eggs, and what is even more dreadful, he\r\nkills and eats the baby birds.  All the birds hate him, and I\r\ndon\'t blame them."\r\n\r\nChatterer could contain himself no longer.  His tongue fairly flew\r\nand he jerked his tail so hard and so fast that Peter Rabbit almost\r\nexpected to see him break it right off.  He called Happy Jack\r\nnames, all the bad names he could think of, and worked himself up\r\ninto such a rage that it was some time before Old Mother Nature\r\ncould quiet him.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he stopped from sheer lack of breath, Old Mother\r\nNature spoke, and her voice was very severe.  "I\'m ashamed of you,\r\nChatterer," said she.  "Unfortunately, what Happy Jack has said\r\nabout you is true.  In  many ways you are a disgrace to the Green\r\nForest.  Still I don\'t know how the Green Forest could get along\r\nwithout you.  Happy Jack forgot to mention that you eat some\r\ninsects at times.  He also forgot to mention that sometimes you\r\nhave a storehouse down in the ground.  Now tell us what you know\r\nabout your cousin, Happy Jack."\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes Chatterer sulked, but he did not dare disobey Old\r\nMother Nature.  "I don\'t know much good about him," he mumbled.\r\n\r\n"And you don\'t know much bad about me either," retorted Happy\r\nJack sharply.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature held up a warning hand.  "That will do," said\r\nshe.  "Now, Chatterer, go on."\r\n\r\n"Happy Jack is more than twice as big as I, but at that, I\'m not\r\nafraid of him," said Chatterer and glared at Happy Jack.  "He is\r\ngray all over, except underneath, where he is white.  He has a\r\ntremendously big tail and is so proud of it he shows it off\r\nwhenever he has a chance.  When he sits up he has a way of\r\nfolding his hands on his breast.  I don\'t know what he does it\r\nfor unless it is to keep them warm in cold weather.  He builds a\r\nnest very much like mine.  Sometimes it is in a hollow tree, but\r\nquite as often it is in the branches of a tree.  He is a good\r\ntraveler in the tree-tops, but he spends a good deal of his time\r\non the ground.  He likes open woodland best, especially where\r\nthere are many nut trees.  He has a storehouse where he stores up\r\nnuts for winter, but he buries in the ground and under the leaves\r\nmore than he puts in his storehouse.  In winter, when he is hungry,\r\nhe hunts for those buried nuts, and somehow he manages to find them\r\neven when they are covered with snow.  When he comes to stealing\r\nhe is not better than I am.  I have seen him steal birds\' eggs,\r\nand I wouldn\'t trust him unwatched around one of my storehouses."\r\n\r\nIt was Happy Jacks\' turn to become indignant.  "I may have taken a\r\nfew eggs when I accidentally ran across them," said he, "but I never\r\ngo looking for them, and I don\'t take them unless I am very hungry\r\nand can\'t find anything else.  I don\'t make a business of robbing\r\nbirds the way you do, and you know it.  If I find one of your\r\nstorehouses and help myself, I am only getting back what you have\r\nstolen from me.  Everybody loves me and that is more than you\r\ncan say."\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough," declared Old Mother Nature, and her voice was very\r\nsharp.  "You two cousins never have agreed and I am afraid never will.\r\nAs long as you are neighbors, I suspect you will quarrel.  Have you\r\ntold us all you know about Happy Jack, Chatterer?"\r\n\r\nChatterer nodded.  He was still mumbling to himself angrily and\r\nwasn\'t polite enough to make a reply.  Old Mother Nature took no\r\nnotice of this.  "What you have told us is good as far as it goes,"\r\nsaid she.  "You said that Happy Jack is all gray excepting\r\nunderneath.  Usually the Gray Squirrel is just as Chatterer has\r\ndescribed him, but sometimes a Gray Squirrel isn\'t gray at all,\r\nbut all black."\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit\'s ears stood straight up with astonishment.  "How can\r\na Gray Squirrel be black?" he demanded.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled.  "That is a fair question, Peter," said\r\nshe.  "Gray Squirrel is simply the name of Happy Jack\'s family.\r\nSometimes some of the babies are born with black coats instead of\r\ngray coats.  Of course they are just the same kind of Squirrel,\r\nonly they look different.  In some parts of the country there are\r\nnumbers of these black-coated Squirrels and many think they are a\r\ndifferent kind of Squirrel.  They are not.  They are simply\r\nblack-coated members of Happy Jack\'s family.  Just remember this.\r\nIt is the same way in the family of Rusty the Fox Squirrel.  Some\r\nmembers are rusty red, some are a mixture of red and gray, and some\r\nare as gray as Happy Jack himself.  Way down in the Sunny South Fox\r\nSquirrels always have white noses and ears.  In the North they never\r\nhave white noses and ears.  Rusty the Fox Squirrel is just a little\r\nbigger than Happy Jack and has just such a handsome tail.  He is\r\nthe strongest and heaviest of the Tree Squirrels and not nearly\r\nas quick and graceful as Happy Jack.  Sometimes Rusty has two\r\nnests in the same tree, one in a hollow in a tree for bad weather\r\nand the other made of sticks and leaves outside in the branches\r\nfor use in good weather.  Rusty\'s habits are very much the same\r\nas those of Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, and therefore he likes\r\nthe same kind of surroundings.  Like his cousin, Happy Jack,\r\nRusty is a great help to me."\r\n\r\nSeeing how surprised everybody looked, Mother Nature explained.\r\n"Both Happy Jack and Rusty bury a great many more nuts than they\r\never need," said she, "and those they do not dig up sprout in the\r\nspring and grow. In that way they plant ever so many trees without\r\nknowing it.  Just remember that, Chatterer, the next time you are\r\ntempted to quarrel with your cousin, Happy Jack.  Very likely Happy\r\nJack\'s great-great-ever-so-great grandfather planted the very tree\r\nyou get your fattest and best hickory nuts from.\r\n\r\n"Way out in the mountains of the Far West you have a cousin called\r\nthe Douglas Squirrel, who is really a true Red Squirrel and whose\r\nhabits are very much like your own.  Some folks call him the Pine\r\nSquirrel.  By the way, Chatterer, Happy Jack forgot to say that\r\nyou are a good swimmer.  Perhaps he didn\'t know it."\r\n\r\nBy the expression of Happy Jack\'s face it was quite clear that he\r\ndidn\'t know it.  "Certainly I can swim," said Chatterer.  "I don\'t\r\nmind the water at all.  I can swim a long distance if I have to."\r\n\r\nThis was quite as much news to Peter Rabbit as had been the fact\r\nthat a cousin of his own was a good swimmer, and he began to feel\r\nsomething very like respect for Chatterer.\r\n\r\n"Are there any other Tree Squirrels?" asked Jumper the Hare.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Old Mother Nature, "there are two--the handsomest\r\nof all the family.  They live out in the Southwest, in one of the\r\nmost wonderful places in all this great land, a place called the\r\nGrand Canyon.  One is called the Abert Squirrel and the other the\r\nKaibab Squirrel.  They are about the size of Happy Jack and Rusty\r\nbut have broader, handsomer tails and their ears have long tufts\r\nof hair.  The Abert Squirrel has black ears, a brown back, gray\r\nsides and white underneath.  Kaibab has brown ears with black\r\ntips, and his tail is mostly white.  Both are very lovely, but\r\ntheir families are small and so they are little known."\r\n\r\nWith this, Old Mother Nature dismissed school for the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI  Striped Chipmunk and his Cousins\r\n\r\nOf course there couldn\'t be a school in the Green Forest without\r\nnews of it spreading very fast.  News travels quickly through the\r\nGreen Forest and over the Green Meadows, for the little people who\r\nlive there are great gossips.  So it was not surprising that Striped\r\nChipmunk heard all about Old Mother Nature\'s school.  The next\r\nmorning, just as the daily lesson was beginning, Striped Chipmunk\r\ncame hurrying up, quite our of breath.\r\n\r\n"Well, well!  See who\'s here!" exclaimed Old Mother Nature.  "What\r\nhave you come for, Striped Chipmunk?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come to try to learn.  Will you let me stay, Mother Nature?"\r\nreplied Striped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'ll let you stay," cried Old Mother Nature heartily.\r\n"I am glad you have come, especially glad you have come today,\r\nbecause to-day\'s lesson is to be about you and your cousins.  Now,\r\nPeter Rabbit, what are the differences between Striped Chipmunk\r\nand his cousins, the Tree Squirrels?"\r\n\r\nPeter looked very hard at Striped Chipmunk as if he had never really\r\nseen him before.  "He is smaller than they are," began Peter.  "In\r\nfact, he is the smallest Squirrel I know."  Peter paused.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature nodded encouragingly.  "Go on," said she.\r\n\r\n"He wears a striped coat," continued Peter.  "The stripes are black\r\nand yellowish-white and run along his sides, a black stripe running\r\ndown the middle of his back.  The rest of his coat is reddish-brown\r\nabove and light underneath.  His tail is rather thin and flat.  I\r\nnever see him in the trees, so I guess he can\'t climb."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I can," interrupted Striped Chipmunk.  "I can climb if I\r\nwant to, and I do sometimes, but prefer the ground."\r\n\r\n"Go on, Peter," said Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"He seems to like old stone walls and rock piles," continued Peter,\r\n"and he is one of the brightest, liveliest, merriest and the most\r\nlovable of all my friends."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Peter," said Striped Chipmunk softly.\r\n\r\n"I never have been able to find his home," continued Peter.  "That is\r\none of his secrets.  But I know it is in the ground.  I guess this\r\nis all I know about him.  I should say the chief difference between\r\nStriped Chipmunk and the Tree Squirrels is that he spends all his\r\ntime on the ground while the others live largely in the trees."\r\n\r\n"Very good, Peter," said Old Mother Nature.  "But there are two\r\nvery important differences which you have not mentioned.  Striped\r\nChipmunk has a big pocket on the inside of each cheek, while his\r\ncousins of the trees have no pockets at all."\r\n\r\n"Of course," cried Peter.  "I don\'t see how I came to forget that.\r\nI\'ve laughed many times at Striped Chipmunk with those pockets\r\nstuffed with nuts or seeds until his head looked three times bigger\r\nthan it does now.  Those pockets must be very handy."\r\n\r\n"They are," replied Striped Chipmunk.  "I couldn\'t get along without\r\nthem.  They save me a lot of running back and forth, I can tell you."\r\n\r\n"And the other great difference," said Old Mother Nature, "is\r\nthat Striped Chipmunk sleeps nearly all winter, just waking up\r\noccasionally to pop his head out on a bright day to see how the\r\nweather is.  A great many folks call Striped Chipmunk a Ground\r\nSquirrel, but more properly he is a Rock Squirrel because he\r\nlikes stony places best.  Supposing, Striped Chipmunk, you tell\r\nus where and how you make your home."\r\n\r\n"I make my home down in the ground," replied Striped Chipmunk.  "I\r\ndig a tunnel just big enough to run along comfortably.  Down deep\r\nenough to be out of reach of Jack Frost I make a nice little\r\nbedroom with a bed of grass and leaves, and I make another little\r\nroom for a storeroom in which to keep my supply of seeds and nuts.\r\nSometimes I have more than one storeroom.  Also I have some little\r\nside tunnels."\r\n\r\n"But why is it I never have been able to find the entrance to your\r\ntunnel?" asked Peter, as full of curiosity as ever.\r\n\r\n"Because I have it hidden underneath the stone wall on the edge of\r\nthe Old Orchard," replied Striped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"But even then, I should think that all the sand you must have\r\ntaken out would give your secret away," cried Peter.\r\n\r\nStriped Chipmunk chuckled happily.  It was a throaty little chuckle,\r\npleasant to hear.  "I looked out for that," said he.  "There isn\'t\r\na grain of that sand around my doorway.  I took it all out through\r\nanother hole some distance away, a sort of back door, and then\r\nclosed it up solidly.  If you please, Mother Nature, if I am not\r\na Ground Squirrel, who is?"\r\n\r\n"Your cousin, Seek Seek the Spermophile, sometimes called Gopher\r\nSquirrel, who lives on the open plains of the West where there are\r\nno rocks or stones.  He likes best the flat, open country.  He is\r\ncalled Spermophile because that means seed-eater, and he lives\r\nlargely on seeds, especially on grain.  Because of this he does a\r\ngreat deal of damage and is much disliked by farmers.\r\n\r\n"Seek Seek\'s family are the true Ground Squirrels.  Please remember\r\nthat they never should be called Gophers, for they are not Gophers.\r\nOne of the smallest members of the family is just about your size,\r\nStriped Chipmunk, and he also wears stripes, only he has more of\r\nthem than you have, and they are broken up into little dots.  He\r\nis called the Thirteen-lined Spermophile.  He has pockets in his\r\ncheeks just as you have, and he makes a home down in the ground\r\nvery similar to yours.  All the family do this, and all of them\r\nsleep through the winter.  While they are great seed-eaters they\r\nalso eat a great many insects and worms, and some of them even\r\nare guilty of killing and eating the babies of birds that nest\r\non the ground, and also young mice.\r\n\r\n"Some members of the family are almost as big as Happy Jack the\r\nGray Squirrel and have gray coats.  They are called Gray Ground\r\nSquirrels and sometimes Gray Gophers.  One of the largest of these\r\nis the California Ground Squirrel.  He has a big, bushy tail, very\r\nlike Happy Jack\'s.  He gets into so much mischief in the grain\r\nfields and in the orchards that he is quite as much disliked as is\r\nJack Rabbit.  This particular member of the family is quite as much\r\nat home among rocks and tree roots as in open ground.  He climbs low\r\ntrees for fruit and nuts, but prefers to stay on the ground.  Now\r\njust remember that the Chipmunks are Rock Squirrels and their cousins\r\nthe Spermophiles are Ground Squirrels.  Now who of you has seen Timmy\r\nthe Flying Squirrel lately?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t," said Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t," said Striped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t," said Happy Jack.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t," said Chatterer.\r\n\r\n"I have," spoke up Jumper the Hare.  "I saw him last evening just\r\nafter jolly, round, red Mr. Sun went to bed behind the Purple Hills\r\nand the Black Shadows came creeping through the Green Forest.  My,\r\nI wish I could fly the way he can!"\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature shook her head disapprovingly.  "Jumper," said she,\r\n"what is wrong with your eyes?  When did you ever see Timmy fly?"\r\n\r\n"Last night," insisted Jumper stubbornly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, you didn\'t," retorted Old Mother Nature.  "You didn\'t see\r\nhim fly, for the very good reason that he cannot fly any more than\r\nyou can.  You saw him simply jump.  Just remember that the only\r\nanimals in this great land who can fly are the Bats.  Timmy the\r\nFlying Squirrel simply jumps from the top of a tree and slides down\r\non the air to the foot of another tree.  If you had used your eyes\r\nyou would have noticed that when he is in the air he never moves\r\nhis legs or arms, and he is always coming down, never going up,\r\nexcepting for a little at the end of his jump, as would be the case\r\nif he could really fly.  He hasn\'t any wings."\r\n\r\n"When he\'s flying, I mean jumping, he looks as if he had wings,"\r\ninsisted Jumper stubbornly.\r\n\r\n"That is simply because I have given him a fold of skin between the\r\nfront and hind leg on each side," explained Old Mother Nature.\r\n"When he jumps he stretches his legs out flat, and that stretches\r\nout those two folds of skin until they look almost like wings.\r\nThis is the reason he can sail so far when he jumps from a high\r\nplace.  You\'ve seen a bird, after flapping its wings to get going,\r\nsail along with them outstretched and motionless.  Timmy does the\r\nsame thing, only he gets going by jumping.  You may have noticed\r\nthat he usually goes to the top of a tree before jumping; then he\r\ncan sail down a wonderfully long distance.  His tail helps him to\r\nkeep his balance.  If there is anything in the way, he can steer\r\nhimself around it.  When he reaches the tree he is jumping for he\r\nshoots up a little way and lands on the trunk not far above the\r\nground.  Then he scampers up that tree to do it all over again."\r\n\r\n"But why don\'t we ever see him?" inquired Striped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"Because, when the rest of you squirrels are out and about, he is\r\ncurled up in a little ball in his nest, fast asleep.  Timmy likes\r\nthe night, especially the early evening, and doesn\'t like the\r\nlight of day."\r\n\r\n"How big is he?" asked Happy Jack, and looked a little sheepish as\r\nif he were a wee bit ashamed of not being acquainted with one of\r\nhis own cousins.\r\n\r\n"He is, if anything, a little smaller than Striped Chipmunk,"\r\nreplied Old Mother Nature.  "Way out in the Far West he grows a\r\nlittle bigger.  His coat is a soft yellowish-brown above; beneath\r\nhe is all white.  His fur is wonderfully soft.  He has very large,\r\ndark, soft eyes, especially suited for seeing at night.  Then, he\r\nis very lively and dearly loves to play.  By nature he is gentle\r\nand lovable."\r\n\r\n"Does he eat nuts like his cousins?" asked Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"He certainly does," replied Old Mother Nature.  "Also he eats\r\ngrubs and insects.  He dearly loves a fat beetle.  He likes meat\r\nwhen he can get it."\r\n\r\n"Where does he make his home?" Peter inquired.\r\n\r\n"Usually in a hole in a tree," said Old Mother Nature.  "He is very\r\nfond of an old home of a Woodpecker.  He makes a comfortable nest\r\nof bark lining, grass, and moss, or any other soft material he can\r\nfind.  Occasionally he builds an outside nest high up in a fork in\r\nthe branches of a tree.  He likes to get into old buildings."\r\n\r\n"Does he have many enemies?" asked Happy Jack.\r\n\r\n"The same enemies the rest of you have," replied Old Mother Nature.\r\n"But the one he has most reason to fear is Hooty the Owl, and that\r\nis the one you have least reason to fear, because Hooty seldom hunts\r\nby day."\r\n\r\n"Does he sleep all winter?" piped up Striped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"Not as you do," said Old Mother Nature.  "In very cold weather he\r\nsleeps, but if he happens to be living where the weather does not\r\nget very cold, he is active all the year around.  Now I guess this\r\nis enough about the Squirrel family."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve forgotten Johnny Chuck," cried Peter.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed.  "So I have," said she.  "That will\r\nnever do, never in the world.  Johnny and his relatives, the\r\nMarmots, certainly cannot be overlooked.  We will take them for\r\nour lesson to-morrow.  Peter, you tell Johnny Chuck to come over\r\nhere to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII  Johnny Chuck Joins the Class\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit delivered Mother Nature\'s message to Johnny Chuck.\r\nJohnny didn\'t seem at all pleased.  He grumbled and growled to\r\nhimself.  He didn\'t want to go to school.  He didn\'t want to learn\r\nanything about his relatives.  He was perfectly satisfied with\r\nthings as they were.  The truth is, Johnny Chuck was already\r\nbeginning to get fat with good living and he is naturally lazy.\r\nAs a rule he can find plenty to eat very near his home, so he\r\nseldom goes far from his own doorstep.  Peter left him grumbling\r\nand growling, and chuckled to himself all the way back to the dear\r\nOld Briar-patch.  He knew that Johnny Chuck would not dare disobey\r\nOld Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nSure enough, the next morning Johnny Chuck came waddling through\r\nthe Green Forest just as Old Mother Nature was about to open school.\r\nHe didn\'t look at all happy, and he didn\'t reply at all to the\r\ngreetings of the others.  But when Old Mother Nature spoke to him\r\nhe was very polite.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Johnny Chuck," said she.\r\n\r\nJohnny bobbed his head and said, "Good morning."\r\n\r\n"I understand," continued Old Mother Nature, "That you are not at\r\nall interested in learning about your relatives.  I am sorry for\r\nany one who doesn\'t want to learn.  The more one knows the better\r\nfitted he is to take care of himself and do his part in the work of\r\nthe Great World.  However, it wasn\'t for your benefit that I sent\r\nword for you to be here this morning.  It was for the benefit of\r\nyour friends and neighbors.  Now sit up so that all can get a good\r\nlook at you."\r\n\r\nJohnny Chuck obediently sat up, and of course all the others stared\r\nat him.  It made him feel quite uncomfortable.  "You remember,"\r\nsaid Old Mother Nature, "how surprised you little folks were when\r\nI told you that Johnny Chuck is a member of the Squirrel family.\r\nHappy Jack, you go sit beside Johnny Chuck, and the rest of you\r\nlook hard at Happy Jack and Johnny and see if you do not see a\r\nfamily resemblance."\r\n\r\nSeeing Happy Jack and Johnny Chuck sitting up side by side, Peter\r\nRabbit caught the resemblance at once.  There was sort of family\r\nlook about them.  "Why!  Why-ee!  Johnny Chuck does look like a\r\nSquirrel," he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Of course he looks like a Squirrel, because he is one," said Old\r\nMother Nature.  "Johnny Chuck is very much bigger and so stout in\r\nthe body that he has none of the gracefulness of the true Squirrels.\r\nBut you will notice that the shape of his head is much the same as\r\nthat of Happy Jack.  He has a Squirrel face when you come to look at\r\nhim closely.  The Woodchucks, sometimes called Ground Hogs, though\r\nwhy any one should call them this is more than I can understand,\r\nbelong to the Marmot branch of the Squirrel family, and wherever\r\nfound they look much alike.\r\n\r\n"As you will notice, Johnny Chuck\'s coat is brownish-yellow, his\r\nfeet are very dark brown, almost black.  His head is dark brown with\r\nlight gray on his cheeks.  Beneath he is reddish-orange, including\r\nhis throat.  His tail is short for a member of the Squirrel family,\r\nand although it is bushy, it is not very big.  He has a number of\r\nwhiskers and they are black.  Some Woodchucks are quite gray, and\r\noccasionally there is one who is almost, or wholly black, just as\r\nthere are black Gray Squirrels.\r\n\r\n"Johnny, here, is not fond of the Green Forest, but loves the Old\r\norchard and the Green Meadows.  In some parts of the country there\r\nare members of his family who prefer to live just on the edge of the\r\nGreen Forest.  You will notice that Johnny has stout claws.  Those\r\nare to help him dig, for all the Marmot family are great diggers.\r\nWhat other use do you have for those claws, Johnny?"\r\n\r\n"They help me to climb," replied Johnny promptly.\r\n\r\n"Climb!" exclaimed Peter Rabbit.  "Who ever heard of a Woodchuck\r\nclimbing?"\r\n\r\n"I can climb if I have to," retorted Johnny Chuck indignantly.  "I\'ve\r\nclimbed up bushes and low trees lots of times, and if I can get a good\r\nrun first, I can climb up the straight trunk of a tree with rough bark\r\nto the first branches--if they are not too far above ground.  You ask\r\nReddy Fox if I can\'t; he knows."\r\n\r\n"That\'s quite true, Johnny," said Old Mother Nature.  "You can climb\r\na little, but as a real climber you are not much of a success.  You\r\nare better as a digger."\r\n\r\n"He certainly is all right as a digger," exclaimed Peter Rabbit.\r\n"My, how he can make the sand fly!  Johnny Chuck certainly is right\r\nat home when it comes to digging."\r\n\r\n"You ought to be thankful that he is," said Old Mother Nature, "for\r\nthe holes he has dug have saved your life more than once.  By the\r\nway, Peter, since you are so well acquainted with those holes,\r\nsuppose you tell us what kind of a home Johnny Chuck has."\r\n\r\nPeter was delighted to air his knowledge.  "The last one I was in,"\r\nsaid he, "was a long tunnel slanting down for quite a distance and\r\nthen straightening out.  The entrance was quite large with a big\r\nheap of sand out in front of it.  Down a little way the tunnel\r\ngrew smaller and then remained the same size all the rest of the way.\r\nWay down at the farther end was a nice little bedroom with some grass\r\nin it.  There were one or two other little rooms, and there were two\r\nbranch tunnels leading up to the surface of the ground, making side\r\nor back doorways.  There was no sand around either of these, and they\r\nwere quite hidden by the long grass hanging over them.  I don\'t\r\nunderstand how Johnny made those doorways without leaving any sand\r\non the doorsteps."\r\n\r\n"Huh!" interrupted Johnny Chuck.  "That was easy enough.  I pushed\r\nall the sand out of the main doorway so that there would be nothing\r\nto attract the attention of any one passing near those back doorways.\r\nThose back doorways are very handy in time of danger."\r\n\r\n"Do you always have three doorways?" asked Happy Jack.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Johnny Chuck.  "Sometimes I have only two and once in\r\na while only one.  But that isn\'t really safe, and I mean always to\r\nhave at least two."\r\n\r\n"Do you use the same house year after year?" piped up Striped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\nJohnny shook his head.  "No," said he.  "I dig a new hole each spring.\r\nMrs. Chuck and I like a change of scene.  Usually my new home isn\'t\r\nvery far from my old one, because I am not fond of traveling.\r\nSometimes, however, if we cannot find a place that just suits us,\r\nwe go quite a distance."\r\n\r\n"Are your babies born down in that little bedroom in the ground?"\r\nasked Jumper the Hare.\r\n\r\n"Of course," replied Johnny Chuck.  "Where else would they be born?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know but Mrs. Chuck might make a nest on the ground the\r\nway Mrs. Peter and Mrs. Jumper do," replied Jumper meekly.\r\n\r\n"No, siree!" replied Johnny.  "Our babies are born in that little\r\nunderground bedroom, and they stay down in the ground until they\r\nare big enough to hunt for food for themselves."\r\n\r\n"How many do you usually have?" inquired Chatterer the Red Squirrel.\r\n\r\n"Six or eight," replied Johnny Chuck.  "Mrs. Chuck and I believe\r\nin large families."\r\n\r\n"Do you eat nuts like the rest of our family?" inquired\r\nStriped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Johnny Chuck.  "Give me green food every time.  There\r\nis nothing so good as tender sweet clover and young grass, unless\r\nit be some of those fine vegetables Farmer Brown grows in his garden."\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit nodded his head very emphatically as if he quite agreed.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you are what is called a vegetarian, then," said Happy\r\nJack, to which Johnny Chuck replied that he supposed he was.  "And\r\nI suppose that is why you sleep all winter," added Happy Jack.\r\n\r\n"If I didn\'t I would starve," responded Johnny Chuck promptly.\r\n"When it gets near time for Jack Frost to arrive, I stuff and stuff\r\nand stuff on the last of the good green things until I\'m so fat I\r\ncan hardly waddle.  Then I go down to my bedroom, curl up and go\r\nto sleep.  Cold weather, snow and ice don\'t worry me a bit."\r\n\r\n"I know," spoke up Striped Chipmunk.  "I sleep most of the winter\r\nmyself.  Of course I have a lot of food stored away down in my\r\nhouse, and once in a while I wake up and eat a little.  Do you\r\never wake up in the winter, Johnny Chuck?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied Johnny.  "I sleep right through, thank goodness.\r\nSometimes I wake up very early in the spring before the snow is\r\nall gone, earlier than I wish I did.  That is where my fat comes\r\nin handy.  It keeps me warm and keeps me alive until I can find\r\nthe first green plants.  Perhaps you have noticed that early in\r\nthe spring I am as thin as I was fat in the fall.  This is\r\nbecause I have used up the fat, waiting for the first green\r\nthings to appear."\r\n\r\n"Do you have many enemies?" asked Peter Rabbit, who has so many\r\nhimself that he is constantly thinking of them.\r\n\r\n"Not many, but enough," growled Johnny Chuck.  "Reddy Fox, Old Man\r\nCoyote, men and Dogs are the worst.  Of course, when I was small I\r\nalways had to be watching out for Hawks, and of course, like all\r\nthe rest of us little folks, I am afraid of Shadow the Weasel.\r\nReddy Fox has tried to dig me out more than once, but I can dig\r\nfaster than he can.  If he ever gets me cornered, he\'ll find that I\r\ncan fight.  A small Dog surprised me once before I could get to my\r\nhole and I guess that Dog never will tackle another Woodchuck."\r\n\r\n"Time is up," interrupted Old Mother Nature.  "Johnny Chuck has a\r\nbig cousin out in the mountains of the Great West named Whistler,\r\nand on the prairies of the Great West he has a smaller cousin named\r\nYap Yap.  They are quite important members of the Marmot family, and\r\nto-morrow I\'ll tell you about them if you want me to.   You need not\r\ncome tomorrow, Johnny Chuck, unless you want to," she added.\r\n\r\nJohnny Chuck hung his head, for he was a little ashamed that he had\r\nbeen so unwilling to come that morning.\r\n\r\n"If you please, Mother Nature," said he, "I think I\'ll come.  I didn\'t\r\nknow I had any close relatives, and I want to know about them."\r\n\r\nSo it was agreed that all would be on hand at sun-up the next\r\nmorning, and then everybody started for home to think over the\r\nthings they had learned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII  Whistler and Yap Yap\r\n\r\nJohnny Chuck was the first one on hand the next morning.  The fact\r\nis, Johnny was quite excited over the discovery that he had some\r\nnear relatives.  He always had supposed that the Woodchucks were a\r\nfamily by themselves.  Now that he knew that he had some close\r\nrelatives, he was filled with quite as much curiosity as ever Peter\r\nRabbit possessed.  Just as soon as Old Mother Nature was ready to\r\nbegin, Johnny Chuck was ready with a question.  "If you please,"\r\nsaid he, "who are my nearest relatives?"\r\n\r\n"The Marmots of the Far West," replied Old Mother Nature.  "You\r\nknow, you are a Marmot, and these cousins of yours out there are\r\na great deal like you in a general way.  The biggest and handsomest\r\nof all is Whistler, who lives in the mountains of the Northwest.\r\nThe fact is, he is the biggest of all the Marmot family."\r\n\r\n"Is he much bigger than Johnny Chuck?" asked Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Considerably bigger," replied Old Mother Nature, nodding her head.\r\n"Considerably bigger.  I should think he would weight twice as much\r\nas Johnny."\r\n\r\nJohnny\'s eyes opened very wide.  "My!" he exclaimed, "I should like\r\nto see him.  Does he look like me?"\r\n\r\n"In his shape he does," said Old Mother Nature, "but he has a very\r\nmuch handsomer coat.  His coat is a mixture of dark brown and white\r\nhairs which give him a grayish color.  The upper part of his head,\r\nhis feet and nails are black, and so are his ears.  A black band\r\nruns from behind each ear down to his neck.  His chin is pure white\r\nand there is white on his nose.  Underneath he is a light, rusty\r\ncolor.  His fur is thicker and softer than yours, Johnny; this is\r\nbecause he lives where it is colder.  His tail is larger, somewhat\r\nbushier, and is a blackish-brown."\r\n\r\n"If you please, why is he called Whistler?" asked Johnny Chuck eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Because he has a sharp, clear whistle which can be heard a very long\r\ndistance," replied Old Mother Nature.  "He sits up just as you do.\r\nIf he sees danger approaching he whistles, as a warning to all his\r\nrelatives within hearing."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is foolish to ask if he lives in a hole in the ground\r\nas Johnny Chuck does," spoke up Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"He does," replied Old Mother Nature.  "All Marmots live in holes in\r\nthe ground, but Whistler lives in entirely different country.  He\r\nlives up on the sides of the mountains, often so high that no trees\r\ngrow there and the ground is rocky.  He digs his hole down in between\r\nthe rocks."\r\n\r\n"It must be a nice, safe hole," said Peter.  "I guess he doesn\'t\r\nhave to worry about being dug out by Reddy fox."\r\n\r\n"You guessed quite right," laughed Old Mother Nature.  "Nevertheless,\r\nhe has reason to fear being dug out.  You see, out where he lives,\r\nGrizzly, the big cousin of Buster Bear, also lives, and Grizzly is\r\nvery fond of a Marmot dinner when he can get one.  He is so big and\r\nstrong and has such great claws that he can pull the rocks apart and\r\ndig Whistler out.  By the way, I forgot to tell you that Whistler is\r\nalso called the Gray Marmot and the Hoary Marmot.  He lives on grass\r\nand other green things and, like Johnny Chuck, gets very fat in the\r\nfall and then sleeps all winter.  There are one or two other Marmots\r\nin the Far West who live farther south than does Whistler, but their\r\nhabits are much the same as those of Whistler and Johnny Chuck.  None\r\nof them are social.  I mean by that you never find two Marmot homes\r\nvery close together.  In this they differ from Johnny\'s smaller cousin,\r\nYap Yap the Prairie Dog.  Yap Yap wouldn\'t be happy if he didn\'t have\r\nclose neighbors of his own kind.  He has one of the most social\r\nnatures of all my little people."\r\n\r\n"Tell us about him," begged Happy Jack Squirrel before Johnny Chuck,\r\nwho is naturally slow, could ask for the same thing.\r\n\r\n"Yap Yap is the smallest of the Marmot family," said Old Mother\r\nNature.  "In a way he is about as closely related to the Ground\r\nSquirrels as he is to the Marmots.  Johnny Chuck has only four\r\nclaws on each front foot, but Yap Yap has five, just as the Ground\r\nSquirrels have.  He looks very much like a small Chuck dressed in\r\nlight yellow-brown.  His tail for the most part is the same color\r\nas his coat, but the end is black, though there is one member of\r\nthe family whose tail has a white tip.  In each cheek is a small\r\npouch, that is, a small pocket, and this is one of the things that\r\nshows how closely related to the Spermophiles he is.\r\n\r\n"As I said before, Yap Yap is very social by nature.  He lives on\r\nthe great open plains of the West and Southwest, frequently where it\r\nis very dry and rain seldom falls.  When you find his home you are\r\nsure to find the homes of many more Prairie Dogs very close at hand.\r\nSometimes there are hundreds and hundreds of homes, making a regular\r\ntown.  This is because the Prairie Dogs dearly love the company of\r\ntheir own kind."\r\n\r\n"Does Yap Yap dig the same kind of a hole that I do?" asked\r\nJohnny Chuck.\r\n\r\n"In a way it is like yours," replied Old Mother Nature, "but at the\r\nsame time it is different.  In the first place, it goes almost\r\nstraight down for a long distance.  In the second place there is no\r\nmound of sand in front of Yap Yap\'s doorway.  Instead of that the\r\ndoorway is right in the very middle of the mound of sand.  One reason\r\nfor this is that when it does rain out where Yap Yap lives it rains\r\nvery hard indeed, so that the water stands on the ground for a short\r\ntime.  The ground being flat, a lot of water would run down into\r\nYap Yap\'s home and make him most uncomfortable if he did not do\r\nsomething to keep it out.  So he brings the sand out and piles it\r\nall the way around his doorway and presses it down with his nose.\r\nIn that way he builds up a firm mound which he uses for two purposes;\r\none is to keep the water from running down the hole, and the other is\r\nas a sort of watch tower.  He sits on the top of his mound to watch\r\nfor his enemies.  His cousins with the white tail digs a hole more\r\nlike yours.\r\n\r\n"Yap Yap loves to visit his neighbors and to have them visit him.\r\nThey are lively little people and do a great deal of talking among\r\nthemselves.  The instant one of them sees an enemy he gives a signal.\r\nThen every Prairie Dog scampers for his own hole and dives in head\r\nfirst.  Almost at once he pops his head out again to see what the\r\ndanger may be."\r\n\r\n"How can he do that without going clear to the bottom to turn\r\naround?" demanded Peter.\r\n\r\n"I wondered if any of you would think of that question," chuckled\r\nOld Mother Nature.  "Just a little way down from the entrance Yap\r\nYap digs a little room at one side of his tunnel.  All he has to do\r\nis to scramble into that, turn around and then pop his head out.\r\nAs I said before, his tunnel goes down very deep; then it turns and\r\ngoes almost equally far underground.  Down there he has a nice\r\nlittle bedroom.  Sometimes he has more than one."\r\n\r\n"If it is so dry out where he lives, how does he get water to drink?"\r\nasked Happy Jack.\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t have to drink," replied Old Mother Nature.  "Some folks\r\nthink that he digs down until he finds water way down underneath,\r\nbut this isn\'t so.  He doesn\'t have to have water.  He gets all\r\nthe moisture he needs from the green things he eats."\r\n\r\n"I suppose, like the rest of us, he has lots of enemies?" said Peter.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature nodded.  "Of course," said she.  "Old Man Coyote\r\nand Reddy Fox are very fond of Prairie Dog.  So are members of the\r\nHawk family.  Then in some places there is a cousin of Shadow the\r\nWeasel called the Black-footed Ferret.  He is to be feared most of\r\nall because he can follow Yap Yap down into his hole.  There is a\r\ncousin of Hooty the Owl called the Burrowing Owl because it builds\r\nits home in a hole in the ground.  You are likely to find many\r\nBurrowing Owls living in Prairie Dog villages.  Also you are apt\r\nto find Buzztail the Rattlesnake there.\r\n\r\n"A lot of people believe that Yap Yap, Buzztail and the little\r\nBurrowing Owl are the best of friends and often live together in\r\nthe same hole.  This isn\'t so at all.  Buzztail is very fond of\r\nyoung Prairie Dog and so is the Burrowing Owl.  Rather than dig a\r\nhole for himself the Owl will sometimes take possession of one of\r\nYap Yap\'s deserted holes.  If he should make a mistake and enter a\r\nhole in which Yap Yap was at home, the chances are that Yap Yap\r\nwould kill the Owl for he knows that the Owl is an enemy.  Buzztail\r\nthe Rattlesnake also makes use of Prairie Dog holes, but it is safe\r\nto say that if there are any Prairie Dog babies down there they\r\nnever live to see what the outside world is like.  So Buzztail\r\nand the Burrowing Owl are really enemies instead of friends of\r\nYap Yap, the Prairie Dog."\r\n\r\n"Why is he called a Dog?" asked Peter.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed right out.  "Goodness knows," said she.  "He\r\ndoesn\'t look like a Dog and he doesn\'t act like a Dog, so why people\r\nshould call him a Dog I don\'t know, unless it is because of his habit\r\nof barking, and even his bark isn\'t at all like a Dog\'s--not nearly\r\nso much so as the bark of Reddy Fox.  Now I guess this will do for\r\nto-day.  Haven\'t you little folks had enough of school?"\r\n\r\n"No," cried Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and Happy Jack and\r\nChatterer the Red Squirrel and Striped Chipmunk and Johnny Chuck.\r\n"We want to know about the rest of the members of the order of\r\nRodents or Gnawers," added Peter.  "Of course in a way they are sort\r\nof related to us and we want to know about them."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed good-naturedly.  "All right," said she,\r\n"come again to-morrow morning and we\'ll see what more we can learn."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX  Two Queer Little Haymakers\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like a little knowledge to make one want more.\r\nJohnny Chuck, who had gone to school only because Old Mother Nature\r\nhad sent for him, had become as full of curiosity as Peter Rabbit.\r\nThe discovery that he had a big, handsome cousin, Whistler the\r\nMarmot, living in the mountains of the Far West, had given Johnny\r\nsomething to think about.  It seemed to Johnny such a queer place\r\nfor a member of his family to live that he wanted to know more\r\nabout it.  So Johnny had a question all ready when Old Mother\r\nNature called school to order the next morning.\r\n\r\n"If you please, Mother Nature," said he, "does my cousin, Whistler,\r\nhave any neighbors up among those rocks where he lives?"\r\n\r\n"He certainly does," replied Old Mother Nature, nodding her head.\r\n"He has for a near neighbor one of the quaintest and most interesting\r\nlittle members of the big order to which you all belong.  And that\r\norder is what?" she asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n"The order of Rodents," replied Peter Rabbit promptly.\r\n\r\n"Right, Peter," replied Old Mother Nature, smiling at Peter.  "I\r\nasked that just to see if you really are learning.  I wanted to\r\nmake sure that I am not wasting my time with you little folks.\r\nNow this little neighbor of Whistler is Little Chief Hare."\r\n\r\nInstantly Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare pricked up their long\r\nears and became more interested than ever, if that were possible.\r\n"I thought you had told us all about our family," cried Jumper,\r\n"but you didn\'t mention Little Chief."\r\n\r\n"No," said Old Mother Nature, "I didn\'t, and the reason I didn\'t\r\nwas because Little Chief isn\'t a member of your family.  He is\r\ncalled Little Chief Hare, but he isn\'t a Hare at all, although he\r\nlooks much like a small Rabbit with short hind legs and rounded\r\nears.  He has a family all to himself and should be called a Pika.\r\nSome folks do call him that, but more call him a Cony, and some\r\ncall him the Crying Hare.  This is because he uses his voice a\r\ngreat deal, which is something no member of the Hare family does.\r\nIn size he is just about as big as one of your half-grown babies,\r\nPeter, so, you see, he really is a very little fellow.  His coat\r\nis grayish-brown.  His ears are of good size, but instead of being\r\nlong, are round.  He has small bright eyes.  His legs are short,\r\nhis hind legs being very little longer than his front ones.  He\r\nhas hair on the soles of his feet just like the members of the\r\nhare family."\r\n\r\n"What about his tail?" piped up Peter Rabbit.  You know Peter is\r\nvery much interested in tails.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled.  "He is worse off than you, Peter," said\r\nshe, "for he hasn\'t any at all.  That is, he hasn\'t any that can be\r\nseen.  He lives way up among the rocks of the great mountains above\r\nwhere the trees grow and often is a very near neighbor to Whistler."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that means that he makes his home down in under rocks,\r\nthe same as Whistler does," spoke up Johnny Chuck.\r\n\r\n"Right," replied Old Mother Nature.  "He is such a little fellow\r\nthat he can get through very narrow places, and he has his home\r\nand barns way down in among the rocks."\r\n\r\n"Barns!" exclaimed Happy Jack Squirrel.  "Barns!  What do you mean\r\nby barns?"\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed.  "I just call them barns," said she,\r\n"because they are the places where he stores away his hay, just as\r\nFarmer Brown stores away his hay in his barn.  I suppose you would\r\ncall them storehouses."\r\n\r\nAt the mention of hay, Peter Rabbit sat bolt upright and his eyes\r\nwere wide open with astonishment.  "Did you say hay?" he exclaimed.\r\n"Where under the sun does he get hay way up there, and what does\r\nhe want of it?"\r\n\r\nThere was a twinkle in Old Mother Nature\'s eyes as she replied,\r\n"He makes that hay just as you see Farmer Brown make hay every\r\nsummer.  It is what he lives on in the winter and in bad weather.\r\nLittle Chief knows just as much about the proper way of making hay\r\nas Farmer Brown does.  Even way up among the rocks there are places\r\nwhere grass and peas-vines and other green things grow.  Little\r\nChief lives on these in summer.  But he is as wise and thrifty as\r\nany Squirrel, another way in which he differs from the Hare family.\r\nHe cuts them when they are ready for cutting and spreads them out\r\non the rocks to dry in the sun.  He knows that if he should take\r\nthem down into his barns while they are fresh and green they would\r\nsour and spoil; so he never stores them away until they are\r\nthoroughly dry.  Then, of course, they are hay, for hay is nothing\r\nbut sun-dried grass cut before it has begun to die.  When his hay\r\nis just as dry as it should be, he takes it down and stores it away\r\nin his barns, which are nothing but little caves down in among the\r\nrocks.  There he has it for use in winter when there is no green food.\r\n\r\n"Little Chief is so nearly the color of the rocks that it takes\r\nsharp eyes to see him when he is sitting still.  He has a funny\r\nlittle squeaking voice, and he uses it a great deal.  It is a funny\r\nvoice because it is hard to tell just where it comes from.  It seems\r\nto come from nowhere in particular.  Sometimes he can be heard\r\nsqueaking way down in his home under the rocks.  Like Johnny Chuck,\r\nhe prefers to sleep at night and be abroad during the day.  Because\r\nhe is so small he must always be on the lookout for enemies.  At the\r\nfirst hint of danger he scampers to safety in among the rocks, and\r\nthere he scolds whoever has frightened him.  There is no more\r\nloveable little person in all my great family than this little\r\nhaymaker of the mountains of the Great West."\r\n\r\n"That haymaking is a pretty good idea of Little Chief\'s," remarked\r\nPeter Rabbit, scratching a long ear with a long hind foot.  "I\'ve\r\na great mind to try it myself."\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed right out, for everybody knew just how easy-going\r\nand thriftless Peter was.  Peter himself grinned.  He couldn\'t\r\nhelp it.\r\n\r\n"That would be a very good idea, Peter," said Old Mother Nature.\r\n"By the way, there is another haymaker out in those same great\r\nmountains of the Far West."\r\n\r\n"Who?" demanded Peter and Johnny Chuck and Happy Jack Squirrel,\r\nall in the same breath.\r\n\r\n"Stubtail the Mountain Beaver," declared Peter promptly.  "I\r\nsuppose Stubtail is his cousin."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature shook her head.  "No," said she.  "No.  Stubtail\r\nand Paddy are no more closely related than the rest of you.  Stubtail\r\nisn\'t a Beaver at all.  His proper name is Sewellel.  Sometimes he\r\nis called Showt\'l and sometimes the Boomer, and sometimes the\r\nChehalis, but most folks call him the Mountain Beaver."\r\n\r\n"Is it because he looks like Paddy the Beaver?" Striped Chipmunk asked.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Old Mother Nature.  "He looks more like Jerry Muskrat\r\nthan he does like Paddy.  He is about Jerry\'s size and looks very\r\nmuch as Jerry would if he had no tail."\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t he any tail at all?" asked Peter.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he has a little tail, a little stub of a tail, but it is so\r\nsmall that to look at him you would think he hadn\'t any," replied\r\nOld Mother Nature.  "He is found out in the same mountains of the\r\nFar West where Whistler and Little Chief live, but instead of\r\nliving way up high among the rocks he is at home down in the valleys\r\nwhere the ground is soft and the trees grow thickly.  Stubtail has\r\nno use for rocks.  He wants soft, wet ground where he can tunnel\r\nand tunnel to his heart\'s content.  In one thing Stubtail is very\r\nlike Yap Yap the Prairie Dog."\r\n\r\n"What is that?" asked Johnny Chuck quickly, for, you know, Yap Yap\r\nis Johnny\'s cousin.\r\n\r\n"In his social habits," replied Old Mother Nature.  "Stubtail isn\'t\r\nfond of living alone.  He wants company of his own kind.  So wherever\r\nyou find Stubtail you are likely to find many of his family.  They\r\nlike to go visiting back and forth.  They make little paths between\r\ntheir homes and all about through the thick ferns, and they keep\r\nthese little paths free and clear, so that they may run along them\r\neasily.  Some of these little paths lead into long tunnels.  These\r\nare made for safety.  Usually the ground is so wet that there will\r\nbe water running in the bottoms of these little tunnels."\r\n\r\n"What kind of a house does Stubtail have?" inquired Johnny\r\nChuck interestedly.\r\n\r\n"A hole in the ground, of course," replied Old Mother Nature.  "It\r\nis dug where the ground is drier than where the runways are made.\r\nMrs. Stubtail makes a nest of dried ferns and close by they build\r\ntwo or three storehouses, for Stubtail and Mrs. Stubtail are\r\nthrifty people."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he fills them with hay, for you said he is a haymaker,"\r\nremarked Happy Jack Squirrel, who is always interested in storehouses.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Old Mother Nature, "he puts hay in them.  He cuts\r\ngrasses, ferns, pea-vines and other green plants and carries them\r\nin little bundles to the entrance to his tunnel.  There he piles\r\nthem on sticks so as to keep them off he damp ground and so that\r\nthe air can help dry them out.  When they are dry, he takes them\r\ninside and stores them away.  He also stores other things.  He likes\r\nthe roots of ferns.  He cuts tender, young twigs from bushes and\r\nstores away some of these.  He is fond of bark.  In winter he is\r\nquite as active as in summer and tunnels about under the snow.\r\nThen he sometimes has Peter Rabbit\'s bad habit of killing trees\r\nby gnawing bark all around as high up as he can reach."\r\n\r\n"Can he climb trees?" asked Chatterer the Red Squirrel.\r\n\r\n"Just about as much as Johnny Chuck can," replied Old Mother Nature.\r\n"Sometimes he climbs up in low bushes or in small, low-branching\r\ntrees to cut off tender shoots, but he doesn\'t do much of this sort\r\nof thing.  His home is the ground.  He is most active at night, but\r\nwhere undisturbed, is out more or less during the day.  When he wants\r\nto cut off a twig he sits up like a Squirrel and holds the twig in\r\nhis hands while he bites it off with his sharp teeth."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t tell us what color his coat is," said Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"I told you he looked very much like Jerry Muskrat," replied Old\r\nMother Nature.  "His coat is brown, much the color of Jerry\'s, but\r\nhis fur is not nearly so soft and fine."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he has enemies just as the rest of us little people have,"\r\nsaid Peter.\r\n\r\n"Of course," replied Old Mother Nature.  "All little people have\r\nenemies, and most big ones too, for that matter.  King Eagle is one\r\nand Yowler the Bob Cat is another.  They are always watching for\r\nStubtail.  That is why he digs so many tunnels.  He can travel under\r\nthe ground then.  My goodness, how time flies!  Scamper home, all of\r\nyou, for I have too much to do to talk any more to-day."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X  Prickly Porky and Grubby Gopher\r\n\r\nAll the way to school the next morning Peter Rabbit wondered who\r\nthey would learn about that day.  He was so busy wondering that he\r\nwas heedless.  Peter is apt to be heedless at times.  The result\r\nwas that as he hopped out of a bramble-tangle just within the edge\r\nof the Green Forest, he all but landed in something worse than the\r\nworst brambles that ever grew.  It was only by a wild side jump\r\nthat he saved himself.  Peter had almost landed among the thousand\r\nlittle spears of Prickly Porky the Porcupine.\r\n\r\n"Gracious!" exclaimed Peter.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you look where you are going," grunted Prickly Porky.\r\nPlainly he was rather peevish.  "It wouldn\'t be my fault if you had\r\na few of my little spears sticking in you this very minute, and it\r\nwould serve you right."  He waddled along a few steps, then began\r\ntalking again.  "I don\'t see why Old Mother Nature sent for me this\r\nmorning," he grumbled.  "I hate a long walk."\r\n\r\nPeter pricked up his long ears.  "I know!" he cried.  "You\'re going\r\nto school, Prickly Porky.  You\'re a Rodent, and we are going to\r\nlearn all about you this morning."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a Rodent; I\'m a Porcupine," grunted Prickly Porky indignantly.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a Rodent just the same.  You\'ve got big gnawing teeth, and\r\nany one with that kind of teeth is a Rodent," retorted Peter.  Then\r\nat a sudden thought a funny look passed over his face.  "Why, that\r\nmeans that you and I are related in a way," he added.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t believe it," grunted Prickly Porky, still shuffling along.\r\n"Don\'t believe it.  Don\'t want to be related to anybody as\r\nheedless as you.  What is this school, anyway?  Don\'t want to go to\r\nschool.  Know all I want to know.  Know how to get all I want to eat\r\nand how to make everybody get out of my way and leave me alone, and\r\nthat\'s enough to know."  He rattled the thousand little spears\r\nhidden in his coat, and Peter shivered at the sound.  It was a most\r\nunpleasant sound.\r\n\r\n"Well, some folks do like to be stupid," snapped Peter and hurried\r\non, lipperty-lipperty-lip, while Prickly Porky slowly shuffled and\r\nrattled along behind.\r\n\r\nAll the others were there when Peter arrived.  Prickly Porky wasn\'t\r\neven in sight.  Old Mother Nature wasted no time.  She has too much\r\nto do ever to waste time.  She called the school to order at once.\r\n\r\n"Yesterday," she began, "I told you about two little haymakers of\r\nthe high mountains of the Far West.  Who were they, Peter Rabbit?"\r\n\r\n"Little Chief Hare, called the Pika or Cony, and Stubtail the\r\nMountain Beaver or Sewellel," replied Peter with great promptness.\r\n\r\n"Right," said Old Mother Nature. "Now I am going to tell you of\r\none of my little plowmen who also lives in the Far West but prefers\r\nthe great plains to the high mountains, though he is sometimes\r\nfound in the latter.  He is Grubby the Gopher, a member of the\r\nsame order the rest of you belong to, but of a family quite his\r\nown.  He is properly called the Pocket Gopher, and way down in\r\nthe Southeast, where he is also found, he is called a Salamander,\r\nthough what for I haven\'t the least idea."\r\n\r\n"Does he have pockets in his cheeks like mine?" asked Striped\r\nChipmunk eagerly.\r\n\r\n"He has pockets in his cheeks, and that is why he is called Pocket\r\nGopher," replied Old Mother Nature; "but they are not at all like\r\nyours, Striped Chipmunk.  Yours are on the inside of your cheeks,\r\nbut his are on the outside."\r\n\r\n"How funny!" exclaimed Striped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"Your pockets are small compared with those of Grubby," continued\r\nOld Mother Nature.  "One of his covers almost the whole side of\r\nhis head back to his short neck, and it is lined with fur, and\r\nremember he has two of them.  Grubby uses these for carrying food\r\nand never for carrying out earth when he is digging a tunnel, as\r\nsome folks think he does.  He stuffs them full with his front feet\r\nand empties them by pressing them from the back with his feet.\r\nThe Gopher family is quite large and the members range in size\r\nfrom the size of Danny Meadow Mouse to that of Robber the Rat,\r\nonly these bigger members are stouter and heavier than Robber.\r\nSome are reddish-brown and some are gray.  But whatever his size\r\nand wherever he is found, Grubby\'s habits are the same."\r\n\r\nAll this time Peter Rabbit had been fidgeting about.  It was quite\r\nclear that Peter had something on his mind.  Now as Old Mother\r\nNature paused, Peter found the chance he had been waiting for.\r\n"If you please, why did you call him a plowman?" he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming to that all in due time," replied Old Mother Nature,\r\nsmiling at Peter\'s eagerness.  "Grubby Gopher spends most of his\r\nlife underground, very much like Miner the Mole, whom you all\r\nknow.  He can dig tunnels just about as fast.  His legs are short,\r\nand his front legs and feet are very stout and strong.  They are\r\narmed with very long, strong claws and it is with these and the\r\nhelp of his big cutting teeth that Grubby digs.  He throws the\r\nearth under him and then kicks it behind him with his hind feet.\r\nWhen he has quite a pile behind him he turns around, and with his\r\nfront feet and head pushes it along to a little side tunnel and\r\nthen up to the surface of the ground.  As soon as he has it all\r\nout he plugs up the opening and goes back to digging.  The loose\r\nearth he has pushed out makes little mounds, and he makes one of\r\nthese mounds every few feet.\r\n\r\n"Grubby is a great worker.  He is very industrious.  Since he is\r\nunderground, it doesn\'t make much difference to him whether it be\r\nnight or day.  In summer, during the hottest part of the day, he\r\nrests.  His eyes are small and weak because he has little use for\r\nthem, coming out on the surface very seldom and then usually in\r\nthe dusk.  He has a funny little tail without any hair on it; this\r\nis very sensitive and serves him as a sort of guide when he runs\r\nbackward along his tunnel, which he can do quite fast.  A funny\r\nthing about those long claws on his front feet is that he folds\r\nthem under when he is walking or running.  Do any of you know why\r\nFarmer Brown plows his garden?"\r\n\r\nAs she asked this, Old Mother Nature looked from one to another,\r\nand each in turn shook his head.  "It is to mix the dead vegetable\r\nmatter thoroughly with the earth so that the roots of the plants\r\nmay get it easily," explained Old Mother Nature.  "By making those\r\ntunnels in every direction and bringing up the earth below to the\r\nsurface, Grubby Gopher does the same thing.  That is why I call\r\nhim my little plowman.  He loosens up the hard, packed earth and\r\nmixes the vegetable matter with it and so makes it easy for seeds\r\nto sprout and plants to grow."\r\n\r\n"Then he must be one of the farmer\'s best friends," spoke up\r\nHappy Jack Squirrel.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature shook her head.  "He has been in the past," said\r\nshe.  "He has done a wonderful work in helping make the land fit\r\nfor farming.  But where land is being farmed he is a dreadful\r\npest, I am sorry to say.  You see he eats the crops the farmer\r\ntries to raise, and the new mounds he is all the time throwing up\r\nbury a lot of the young plants, and in the meadows make it very\r\nhard to use a mowing machine for cutting hay.  Then Grubby gets\r\ninto young orchards and cuts off all the tender roots of young\r\ntrees.  This kills them.  You see he is fond of tender roots,\r\nseeds, stems of grass and grain, and is never happier than when\r\nhe can find a field of potatoes.\r\n\r\n"Being such a worker, he has to have a great deal to eat.  Then,\r\ntoo, he stores away a great deal for winter, for he doesn\'t sleep\r\nin winter as Johnny Chuck does.  He even tunnels about under the\r\nsnow.  Sometimes he fills these little snow tunnels with the earth\r\nhe brings up from below, and when the snow melts it leaves queer\r\nlittle earth ridges to show where the tunnels were.\r\n\r\n"Grubby is very neat in his habits and keeps his home and himself\r\nvery clean.  During the day he leaves one of his mounds open for\r\na little while to let in fresh air.  But it is only for a little\r\nwhile.  Then he closes it again.  He doesn\'t dare leave it open\r\nvery long, for fear Shadow the Weasel or a certain big Snake called\r\nthe Gopher Snake will find it and come in after him.  Digger the\r\nBadger is the only one of his enemies who can dig fast enough to\r\ndig him out, but at night, when he likes to come out for a little\r\nair or to cut grain and grass, he must always watch for Hooty the\r\nOwl.  Old Man Coyote and members of the Hawk family are always\r\nlooking for him by day, so you see he has plenty of enemies, like\r\nthe rest of you.\r\n\r\n"He got the name Gopher because that comes from a word meaning\r\nhoneycomb, and Grubby\'s tunnels go in every direction until the\r\nground is like honeycomb.  He isn\'t a bit social and has rather\r\na mean disposition.  He is always ready to fight.  On the plains\r\nhe has done a great deal to make the soil fine and rich, as I have\r\nalready told you, but on hillsides he does a great deal of harm.\r\nThe water runs down his tunnels and washes away the soil.  Because\r\nof this and the damage he does to crops, man is his greatest\r\nenemy.  But man has furnished him with new and splendid foods easy\r\nto get, and so Grubby\'s family increases faster than it used to,\r\nin spite of traps and poison.  Hello!  See who\'s here!  It is\r\nabout time."\r\n\r\nThere was a shuffling and rattling and grunting, and Prickly\r\nPorky climbed up on an old stump, looking very peevish and much\r\nout of sorts.  He had come to school much against his will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI  A Fellow With a Thousand Spears\r\n\r\n"There," said Old Mother Nature, pointing to Prickly Porky the\r\nPorcupine, "is next to the largest member of your order, which is?"\r\n\r\n"Order of Rodents," piped up Striped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"He is not only next to the largest, but is the stupidest," continued\r\nOld Mother Nature.  "At least that is what people say of him, though\r\nI suspect he isn\'t as stupid as he sometimes seems.  Anyway, he\r\nmanages to keep well fed and escape his enemies, which is more than\r\ncan be said for some others who are supposed to have quick wits."\r\n\r\n"Escaping his enemies is no credit to him.  They are only too glad\r\nto keep out of his way; he doesn\'t have to fear anybody," said\r\nChatterer the Red Squirrel to his cousin, Happy Jack.\r\n\r\nHis remark didn\'t escape the keen ears of Old Mother Nature.  "Are\r\nyou sure about that?" she demanded.  "Now there\'s Pekan the Fisher-"\r\n\r\nShe was interrupted by a great rattling on the old stump.  Everybody\r\nturned to look.  There was Prickly Porky backing down as fast as he\r\ncould, which wasn\'t fast at all, and rattling his thousand little\r\nspears as he did so.  It was really very funny.  Everybody had to\r\nlaugh, even Old Mother Nature.  You see, it was plain that he was\r\nin a great hurry, yet every movement was slow and clumsy.\r\n\r\n"Well, Prickly Porky, what does this mean?  Where are you going?"\r\ndemanded Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nPrickly Porky turned his dull-looking eyes towards her, and in them\r\nwas a troubled, worried look.  "Where\'s Pekan the Fisher?" he asked,\r\nand his voice shook a little with something very much like fear.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature understood instantly.  When she had said, "Now\r\nthere\'s Pekan the Fisher," Prickly Porky had waited to hear no\r\nmore.  He had instantly thought that she meant that Pekan was\r\nright there somewhere.  "It\'s all right, Prickly Porky," said she.\r\n"Pekan isn\'t anywhere around here, so climb back on that stump and\r\ndon\'t worry.  Had you waited for me to finish, you would have saved\r\nyourself a fright.  Chatterer had just said that you didn\'t have\r\nto fear anybody and I was starting to explain that he was wrong,\r\nthat despite your thousand little spears you have reason to fear\r\nPekan the Fisher."\r\n\r\nPrickly Porky shivered and this made the thousand little spears in\r\nhis coat rattle.  It was such a surprising thing to see Prickly Porky\r\nactually afraid that the other little folks almost doubted their own\r\neyes.  "Are you quite sure that Pekan isn\'t anywhere around?" asked\r\nPrickly Porky, and his voice still shook.\r\n\r\n"Quite sure," replied Old Mother Nature.  "If he were I wouldn\'t\r\nallow him to hurt you.  You ought to know that.  Now sit up so\r\nthat every one can get a good look at you."\r\n\r\nPrickly Porky sat up, and the others gathered around the foot of\r\nthe stump to look at him.  "He certainly is no beauty," murmured\r\nHappy Jack Squirrel.\r\n\r\nHappy Jack was quite right.  He was anything but handsome.  The\r\ntruth is he was the homeliest, clumsiest-looking fellow in all\r\nthe Green Forest.  He was a little bigger than Bobby Coon and his\r\nbody was thick and heavy-looking.  His back humped up like an\r\narch.  His head was rather small for the size of his body, short\r\nand rather round.  His neck was even shorter.  His eyes were small\r\nand very dull.  It was plain that he couldn\'t see far, or clearly\r\nunless what he was looking at was close at hand.  His ears were\r\nsmall and nearly hidden in hair.  His front teeth, the gnawing\r\nteeth which showed him to be a Rodent, were very large and bright\r\norange.  His legs were short and stout.  He had four toes on each\r\nfront foot and five on each hind foot, and these were armed with\r\nquite long, stout claws.\r\n\r\nBut the queerest thing and the most interesting thing about Prickly\r\nPorky was his coat.  Not one among the other little people of the\r\nGreen Forest has a coat anything like his.  Most of them have a\r\nsoft, short under fur protected and more or less hidden by longer,\r\ncoarser hair.  Prickly Porky had the long coarse hair and on his\r\nback it was very long and coarse, brownish-black in color up to\r\nthe tips, which were white.  Under this long hair was some soft\r\nwoolly fur, but what that long hair hid chiefly was an array of\r\nwicked-looking little spears called quills.  They were white to the\r\ntips, which were dark and very, very sharply pointed.  All down the\r\nsides were tiny barbs, so small as hardly to be seen, but there\r\njust the same.  On his head the quills were about an inch long,\r\nbut on his back they were four inches long, becoming shorter\r\ntowards the tail.  The latter was rather short, stout, and covered\r\nwith short quills.\r\n\r\nAs he sat there on that old stump some of Prickly Porky\'s little\r\nspears could be seen peeping out from the long hair on his back,\r\nbut they didn\'t look particularly dangerous.  Peter Rabbit\r\nsuddenly made a discovery.  "Why!" he exclaimed.  "He hasn\'t any\r\nlittle spears on the under side of him!"\r\n\r\n"I wondered who would be the first to notice that," said Old Mother\r\nNature.  "No, Prickly Porky hasn\'t any little spears underneath,\r\nand Pekan the Fisher has found that out.  He knows that if he can\r\nturn Prickly Porky on his back he can kill him without much danger\r\nfrom those little spears, and he has learned how to do that very\r\nthing.  That is why Prickly Porky is afraid of him.  Now, Prickly\r\nPorky, climb down off that stump and show these little folks what\r\nyou do when an enemy comes near."\r\n\r\nGrumbling and growling, Prickly Porky climbed down to the ground.\r\nThen he tucked his head down between his front paws and suddenly\r\nthe thousand little spears appeared all over him, pointing in\r\nevery direction until he looked like a giant chestnut burr.  Then\r\nhe began to thrash his tail from side to side.\r\n\r\n"What is he doing that for?" asked Johnny Chuck, looking\r\nrather puzzled.\r\n\r\n"Go near enough to be hit by it, and you\'ll understand," said Old\r\nMother Nature dryly.  "That is his one weapon.  Whoever is hit by\r\nthat tail will find himself full of those little spears and will\r\ntake care never to go near Prickly Porky again.  Once those little\r\nspears have entered the skin, they keep working in deeper and\r\ndeeper, and more than one of his enemies has been killed by them.\r\nOn account of those tiny barbs they are hard to pull out, and\r\npulling them out hurts dreadfully.  Just try one and see."\r\n\r\nBut no one was anxious to try, so Old Mother Nature paused only a\r\nmoment.  "You will notice that he moves that tail quickly," she\r\ncontinued.  "It is the only thing about him which is quick.  When\r\nhe has a chance, in time of danger, he likes to get his head\r\nunder a log or rock, instead of putting it between his paws as he\r\nis doing now.  Then he plants his feet firmly and waits for a\r\nchance to use that tail."\r\n\r\n"Is it true that he can throw those little spears at folks?"\r\nasked Peter.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature shook her head.  "There isn\'t a word of truth in\r\nit," she declared.  "That story probably was started by some one\r\nwho was hit by his tail, and it was done so quickly that the victim\r\ndidn\'t see the tail move and so thought the little spears were\r\nthrown at him."\r\n\r\n"How does he make all those little spears stand up that way?"\r\nasked Jumper the Hare.\r\n\r\n"He has a special set of muscles for just that purpose," explained\r\nOld Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"When those quills stick into some one they must pull out of\r\nPrickly Porky\'s own skin; I should think that would hurt him,"\r\nspoke up Striped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," replied Old Mother Nature.  "They are very loosely\r\nfastened in his skin and come out at the least little pull.  New\r\nOnes grow to take the place of those he loses.  Notice that he\r\nputs his whole foot flat on the ground just as Buster Bear and\r\nBobby Coon do, and just as those two-legged creatures called men\r\ndo.  Very few animals do this, and those that do are said to be\r\nplantigrade.  Now, Prickly Porky, tell us what you eat and where\r\nyou make your home, and that will end today\'s lesson."\r\n\r\n"I eat bark, twigs and leaves mostly," grunted Prickly Porky\r\nungraciously.  "I like hemlock best of all, but also eat poplar,\r\npine and other trees for a change.  Sometimes I stay in a tree for\r\ndays until I have stripped it of all its bark and leaves.  I don\'t\r\nsee any sense in moving about any more than is necessary."\r\n\r\n"But that must kill the tree!" exclaimed Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Well, what of it?" demanded Prickly Porky crossly.  "There are\r\nplenty of trees.  In summer I like lily pads and always get them\r\nwhen I can."\r\n\r\n"Can you swim?" asked Peter eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Of course," grunted Prickly Porky.\r\n\r\n"I never see you out on the Green Meadows," said Peter.\r\n\r\n"And you never will," retorted Prickly Porky.  "The Green Forest\r\nfor me every time.  Summer or winter, I\'m at home there."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you sleep through the cold weather the way Buster Bear and\r\nI do?" asked Johnny Chuck.\r\n\r\n"What should I sleep for?" grumbled Prickly Porky.  "Cold weather\r\ndoesn\'t bother me.  I like it.  I have the Green Forest pretty much\r\nto myself then.  I like to be alone.  And as long as there are trees,\r\nthere is plenty to eat.  I sleep a great deal in the daytime because\r\nI like night best."\r\n\r\n"What about your home?" asked Happy Jack.\r\n\r\n"Home is wherever I happen to be, most of the time, but Mrs. Porky\r\nhas a home in a hollow log or a cave or under the roots of a tree\r\nwhere the babies are born.  I guess that\'s all I\'ve got to tell you."\r\n\r\n"You might add that those babies are big for the size of their\r\nmother and have a full supply of quills when they are born," said\r\nOld Mother Nature.  "And you forgot to say how fond of salt you\r\nare, and how often this fondness gets you into trouble around the\r\ncamps of men.  Your fear of Pekan the Fisher we all saw.  I might\r\nadd that Puma the Panther is to be feared at times, and when he\r\nis very hungry Buster Bear will take a chance on turning you on\r\nyour back.  By the way, don\'t any of you call Prickly Porky a\r\nHedgehog.  He isn\'t any thing of the kind.  He is sometimes called\r\na Quill Pig, but his real name, Porcupine, is best.  He has no\r\nnear relatives.  Tomorrow morning, instead of meeting here, we\'ll\r\nhold school on the shore of the pond Paddy the Beaver has made.\r\nSchool is dismissed."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII  A Lumberman and Engineer\r\n\r\nJohnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk were the only ones who were not\r\non hand at the pond of Paddy the Beaver deep in the Green Forest\r\nat sun-up the next morning.  Johnny and Striped Chipmunk were\r\nafraid to go so far from home.  To the surprise of everybody,\r\nPrickly Porky was there.\r\n\r\n"He must have traveled all night to get here he is such a slow-poke,"\r\nsaid Peter Rabbit to his cousin, Jumper the Hare.\r\n\r\nPeter wasn\'t far from the truth.  But how ever he got there, there\r\nhe was, reaching for lily pads from an old log which lay half in\r\nthe water, and appearing very well satisfied with life.  You know\r\nthere is nothing like a good meal of things you like, to make\r\neverything seem just as it should.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature seated herself on one end of Paddy\'s dam and\r\ncalled the school to order.  Just as she did so a brown head\r\npopped out of the water close by and a pair of anxious eyes looked\r\nup at Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"It is quite all right, Paddy," said she softly.  "These little\r\nfolks are trying to gain a little knowledge of themselves and\r\nother folks, and we are going to have this morning\'s lesson right\r\nhere because it is to be about you."\r\n\r\nPaddy the Beaver no longer looked anxious.  There was a sparkle in\r\nhis eyes.  "May I stay?" he asked eagerly.  "If there is a chance\r\nto learn anything I don\'t want to miss it."\r\n\r\nBefore Old Mother Nature could reply Peter Rabbit spoke up.  "But\r\nthe lesson is to be about you and your family.  Do you expect to\r\nlearn anything about yourself?" he demanded, and chuckled as if he\r\nthought that a great joke.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that some one named Peter learned a great deal about\r\nhis own family when he first came to school to me," said Old Mother\r\nNature.  Peter had grace enough to hang his head and look ashamed.\r\n"Of course you may stay, Paddy.  In fact, I want you to.  There are\r\nsome things I shall want you to explain.  That is why we are holding\r\nschool over here this morning.  Just come up here on your dam where\r\nwe can all get a good look at you."\r\n\r\nPaddy the Beaver climbed out on his dam.  It was the first time\r\nHappy Jack Squirrel ever had seen him out of water, and Happy Jack\r\ngave a little gasp of surprise.  "I had no idea he is so big!"\r\nhe exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"He is the biggest of all the Rodents in this country, and one of\r\nthe biggest in all the Great World.  Also he is the smartest\r\nmember of the whole order," said Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t look it," said Chatterer the Squirrel with a saucy\r\njerk of his tail.\r\n\r\n"Which means, I suppose, that you haven\'t the least doubt that you\r\nare quite as smart as he," said Old Mother Nature quietly, and\r\nChatterer looked both guilty and a little bit ashamed.  "I\'ll admit\r\nthat you are smart, Chatterer, but often it is in a wrong way.\r\nPaddy is smart in the very best way.  He is a lumberman, builder\r\nand engineer.  A lot of my little people are workers, but they are\r\ndestructive workers.  The busier they are, the more they destroy.\r\nPaddy the Beaver is a constructive worker.  That means that he is a\r\nbuilder instead of a destroyer."\r\n\r\n"How about all those trees he cuts down?  If that isn\'t destroying,\r\nI don\'t know what is!" said Chatterer, and with each word jerked\r\nhis tail as if somehow his tongue and tail were connected.\r\n\r\n"So it is," replied Old Mother Nature good-naturedly.  "But just\r\nthink of the number of trees you destroy."\r\n\r\n"I never have destroyed a tree in my life!" declared\r\nChatterer indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you have," retorted Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"I never have!" contradicted Chatterer, quite forgetting to whom\r\nhe was speaking.\r\n\r\nBut Old Mother Nature overlooked this.  "I don\'t suppose you ever\r\nate a chestnut or a fat hickory nut or a sweet beechnut," said\r\nshe softly.\r\n\r\n"Of course," retorted Chatterer sharply.  "I\'ve eaten ever and\r\never and ever so many of them.  What of it?"\r\n\r\nIn the heart of each one was a little tree, explained Old Mother\r\nNature.  "But for you very many of those little trees would have\r\nsprung up and some day would have made big trees.  So you see for\r\nevery tree Paddy has destroyed you probably have destroyed a\r\nhundred.  You eat the nuts that you may live.  Paddy cuts down the\r\ntrees that he may live, for the bark of those trees is his food.\r\nLike Prickly Porky he lives chiefly on bark.  But, unlike Prickly\r\nPorky, he doesn\'t destroy a tree for the bark alone.  He wastes\r\nnothing.  He makes use of every bit of that tree.  He does something\r\nfor the Green Forest in return for the trees he takes."\r\n\r\nChatterer looked at Happy Jack and blinked in a puzzled way.\r\nHappy Jack looked at Peter Rabbit and blinked.  Peter looked at\r\nJumper the Hare and blinked.  Jumper looked at Prickly Porky and\r\nblinked.  Then all looked at Paddy the Beaver and finally at Old\r\nMother Nature, and all blinked.  Old Mother Nature chuckled.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think the Green Forest is more beautiful because of\r\nthis little pond?" she asked.  Everybody nodded.  "Of course," she\r\ncontinued.  "But there wouldn\'t be any little pond here were it\r\nnot for Paddy and the trees he has cut.  He destroyed the trees in\r\norder to make the pond.  That is what I meant when I called him a\r\nconstructive worker.  Now I want you all to take a good look at\r\nPaddy.  Then he will show us just how as a lumberman he cuts\r\ntrees, as a builder he constructs houses and dams, and as an\r\nengineer he digs canals."\r\n\r\nAs Paddy sat there on his dam, he looked rather like a giant member\r\nof the Rat family, though his head was more like that of a Squirrel\r\nthan a Rat.  His body was very thick and heavy, and in color he\r\nwas dark brown, lighter underneath than above.  Squatting there\r\non the dam his back was rounded.  All together, he was a very\r\nclumsy-looking fellow.\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit appeared to be interested in just one thing, Paddy\'s\r\ntail.  He couldn\'t keep his eyes off it.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature noticed this.  "Well, Peter," said she, "what\r\nhave you on your mind now?"\r\n\r\n"That tail," replied Peter.  "That\'s the queerest tail I\'ve ever\r\nseen.  I should think it would be heavy and dreadfully in the way."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed.  "If you ask him Paddy will tell you\r\nthat that tail is the handiest tail in the Green Forest," said she.\r\n"There isn\'t another like it in all the Great World, and if you\'ll\r\nbe patient you will see just how handy it is."\r\n\r\nIt was a queer-looking tail.  It was broad and thick and flat, oval\r\nin shape, and covered with scales instead of hair.  Just then Jumper\r\nthe Hare made a discovery.  "Why!" he exclaimed, "Paddy has feet\r\nlike Honker the Goose!"\r\n\r\n"Only my hind feet," said Paddy.  "They have webs between the toes\r\njust as Honker\'s have.  That is for swimming.  But there are no\r\nwebs between my fingers."  He held up a hand for all to see.  Sure\r\nenough, the fingers were free.\r\n\r\n"Now that everybody has had a good look at you, Paddy," said Old\r\nMother Nature, "suppose you swim over to where you have been\r\ncutting trees.  We will join you there, and then you can show us\r\njust how you work."\r\n\r\nPaddy slipped into the water, where for a second or two he floated\r\nwith just his head above the surface.  Then he quickly raised his\r\nbroad, heavy tail and brought it down on the water with a slap that\r\nsounded like the crack of a terrible gun.  It was so loud and\r\nunexpected that every one save Old Mother Nature and Prickly Porky\r\njumped with fright.  Peter Rabbit happened to be right on the edge\r\nof the dam and, because he jumped before he had time to think, he\r\njumped right into the water with a splash.  Now Peter doesn\'t like\r\nthe water, as you know, and he scrambled out just as fast as ever\r\nhe could.  How the others did laugh at him.\r\n\r\n"What did he do that for?" demanded Peter indignantly.  "To show\r\nyou one use he has for that handy tail," replied Old Mother Nature.\r\n"That is the way he gives warning to his friends whenever he\r\ndiscovers danger.  Did you notice how he used his tail to aid him\r\nin swimming?  He turns it almost on edge and uses it as a rudder.\r\nThose big, webbed hind feet are the paddles which drive him through\r\nthe water.  He can stay under water a long time--as much as five\r\nminutes.  See, he has just come up now."\r\n\r\nSure enough, Paddy\'s head had just appeared clear across the pond\r\nalmost to the opposite shore, and he was now swimming on the surface.\r\nOld Mother Nature at once led the way around the pond to a small\r\ngrove of poplar trees which stood a little way back from the water.\r\nPaddy was already there.  "Now," said Old Mother Nature "show us what\r\nkind of a lumberman you are."\r\n\r\nPaddy picked out a small tree, sat up much as Happy Jack Squirrel\r\ndoes, but with his big flat tail on the ground to brace him,\r\nseized the trunk of the tree in both hands, and went to work with\r\nhis great orange-colored cutting teeth.  He bit out a big chip.\r\nThen another and another.  Gradually he worked around the tree.\r\nAfter a while the tree began to sway and crack.  Paddy bit out two\r\nor three more chips, then suddenly slapped the ground with his\r\ntail as a warning and scampered back to a safe distance.  He was\r\ntaking no chances of being caught under that falling tree.\r\n\r\nThe tree fell, and at once Paddy returned to work.  The smaller\r\nbranches he cut off with a single bite at the base of each.\r\nThe larger ones required a number of bites.  Then he set to work\r\nto cut the trunk up in short logs.  At this point Old Mother\r\nNature interrupted.\r\n\r\n"Now show us," said she, "what you do with the logs."\r\n\r\nPaddy at once got behind a log, and by pushing, rolled it ahead\r\nof him until at last it fell with a splash in the water of a ditch\r\nor canal which led from near that grove of trees to the pond.\r\nPaddy followed into the water and began to push it ahead of him\r\ntowards the pond.\r\n\r\n"That will do," spoke up Old Mother Nature. "Come out and show us\r\nhow you take the branches."\r\n\r\nObediently Paddy climbed out and returned to the fallen tree.  There\r\nhe picked up one of the long branches in his mouth, grasping it near\r\nthe butt, twisted it over his shoulder and started to drag it to\r\nthe canal.  When he reached the latter he entered the water and began\r\nswimming, still dragging the branch in the same way.  Once more Old\r\nMother Nature stopped him.  "You\'ve shown us how you cut trees and\r\nmove them, so now I want you to answer a few questions," said she.\r\n\r\nPaddy climbed out and squatted on the bank.\r\n\r\n"How did this canal happen to be here handy?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Why, I dug it, of course," replied Paddy looking surprised.  "You\r\nsee, I\'m rather slow and clumsy on land, and don\'t like to be far\r\nfrom water.  Those trees are pretty well back from the pond, so I\r\ndug this canal, which brings the water almost to them.  It makes\r\nit safer for me in case Old Man Coyote or Buster Bear or Yowler the\r\nBobcat happens to be looking for a Beaver dinner.  Also it makes\r\nit very much easier to get my logs and branches to the pond."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature nodded.  "Just so," said she.  "I want the rest\r\nof you to notice how well this canal has been dug.  At the other\r\nend it is carried along the bottom of the pond where the water is\r\nshallow so as to give greater depth.  Now you will understand why\r\nI called Paddy an engineer.  What do you do with your logs and\r\nbranches, Paddy?"\r\n\r\n"Put them in my food-pile, out there where the water is deep near\r\nmy house," replied Paddy promptly.  "The bark I eat, and the bare\r\nsticks I use to keep my house and dam in repair.  In the late fall\r\nI cut enough trees to keep me in food all winter.  When my pond is\r\ncovered with ice I have nothing to worry about; my food supply\r\nis below the ice.  When I am hungry I swim out under the ice, get\r\na stick, take it back into my house and eat the bark.  Then I take\r\nthe bare stick outside to use when needed on my dam or house."\r\n\r\n"How did you come to make this fine pond?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I just happened to come exploring up the Laughing Brook and\r\nfound there was plenty of food here and a good place for a pond,"\r\nreplied Paddy.  "I thought I would like to live here.  Down where\r\nmy dam is, the Laughing Brook was shallow--just the place for\r\na dam."\r\n\r\n"Tell us why you wanted a pond and how you built that dam,"\r\ncommanded Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Why, I had to have a pond, if I was to stay here," replied Paddy,\r\nas if every one must understand that.  "The Laughing Brook wasn\'t\r\ndeep or big enough for me to live here safely.  If it had been, I\r\nwould have made my home in the bank and not bothered with a house\r\nor dam.  But it wasn\'t, so I had to make a pond.  It required a\r\nlot of hard work, but it is worth all it cost.\r\n\r\n"First, I cut a lot of brush and young trees and placed them in\r\nthe Laughing Brook in that shallow place, with the butts pointing\r\nup-stream.  I kept them in place by piling mud and stones on them.\r\nThen I kept piling on more sticks and brush and mud.  The water\r\nbrought down leaves and floating stuff, and this caught in the\r\ndam and helped fill it in.  I dug a lot of mud in front of it and\r\nused this to fill in the spaces between the sticks.  This made the\r\nwater deeper in front of the dam and at the same time kept it from\r\ngetting through.  As the water backed up, of course it made a pond.\r\nI kept making my dam longer and higher, and the longer and higher\r\nit became the bigger the pond grew.  When it was big enough and\r\ndeep enough to suit me, I stopped work on the dam and built my\r\nhouse out there."\r\n\r\nEverybody turned to look at Paddy\'s house, the roof of which stood\r\nhigh out of water a little way from the dam.  "Tell us how you\r\nbuilt that," said Old Mother Nature quietly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I just made a big platform of sticks and mud out there where\r\nit was deep enough for me to be sure that the water could not\r\nfreeze clear to the bottom, even in the coldest weather," replied\r\nPaddy, in a matter-of-fact tone.  "I built it up until it was\r\nabove water.  Then I built the walls and roof of sticks and mud,\r\njust as you see them there.  Inside I have a fine big room with a\r\ncomfortable bed of shredded wood.  I have two openings in the\r\nfloor with a long passage leading from each down through the\r\nfoundations and opening at the bottom of the pond.  Of course,\r\nthese are filled with water.  Some houses have only one passage,\r\nbut I like two.  These are the only entrances to my house.\r\n\r\n"Every fall I repair my walls and roof, adding sticks and mud and\r\nturf, so that now they are very thick.  Late in the fall I\r\nsometimes plaster the outside with mud.  This freezes hard, and\r\nno enemy who may reach my house on the ice can tear it open.  I\r\nguess that\'s all."\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit drew a long breath.  "What dreadful lot of work," said\r\nhe.  "Do you work all the time?"\r\n\r\nPaddy chuckled.  "No, Peter," said he.  And Old Mother Nature nodded\r\nin approval.  "Quite right," said she.  "Quite right.  Are there\r\nany more questions?"\r\n\r\n"Do you eat nothing but bark?"  It was Happy Jack Squirrel who spoke.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," replied Paddy.  "In summer I eat berries, mushrooms, grass\r\nand the leaves and stems of a number of plants.  In winter I vary my\r\nfare with lily roots and the roots of alder and willow.  But bark is\r\nmy principal food."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature waited a few minutes, but as there were no more\r\nquestions she added a few words.  "Now I hope you understand why I\r\nam so proud of Paddy the Beaver, and why I told you that he is a\r\nlumberman, builder and engineer," said she.  "For the next lesson\r\nwe will take up the Rat family."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII  A Worker and a Robber\r\n\r\n"Now we come to the largest family of the Rodent order, the Rat\r\nfamily, which of course includes the Mice," said Old Mother Nature,\r\nafter calling school to order at the old meeting-place.  "And the\r\nlargest member of the family reminds me very much of the one we\r\nlearned about yesterday."\r\n\r\n"I know!" cried Peter Rabbit.  "You mean Jerry Muskrat."\r\n\r\n"Go to the head of the class, Peter," said Old Mother Nature,\r\nsmiling.  "Jerry is the very one, the largest member of the Rat\r\nfamily.  Sometimes he is spoken of as a little cousin of Paddy the\r\nBeaver.  Probably this is because he looks something like a small\r\nBeaver, builds a house in the water as Paddy does, and lives in\r\nvery much the same way.  The truth is, he is no more closely related\r\nto Paddy than he is to the rest of you.  He is a true Rat.  He is\r\ncalled Muskrat because he carries with him a scent called musk.  It\r\nis not an unpleasant scent, like that of Jimmy Skunk, and isn\'t used\r\nfor the same purpose.  Jerry uses his to tell his friends where he\r\nhas been.  He leaves a little of it at the places he visits.  Some\r\nfolks call him Musquash, but Muskrat is better.\r\n\r\n"Jerry is seldom found far from the water and then only when he is\r\nseeking a new home.  He is rather slow and awkward on land; but in\r\nthe water he is quite at home, as all of you know who have visited\r\nthe Smiling Pool.  He can dive and swim under water a long distance,\r\nthough not as far as Paddy the Beaver."\r\n\r\n"Has he webbed hind feet like Paddy?" piped up Jumper the Hare.\r\n\r\n"Yes and no," replied Old Mother Nature.  "They are not fully webbed\r\nas Paddy\'s are, but there is a little webbing between some of the\r\ntoes, enough to be of great help in swimming.  His tail is of greater\r\nuse in swimming than is Paddy\'s.  It is bare and scaly, but instead\r\nof being flat top and bottom it is flattened on the sides, and he\r\nuses it as a propeller, moving it rapidly from side to side.\r\n\r\n"Like Paddy he has a dark brown outer coat, lighter underneath than\r\non his back and sides, and like Paddy he has a very warm soft under\r\ncoat, through which the water cannot get and which keeps him\r\ncomfortable, no matter how cold the water is.  You have all seen\r\nhis house in the Smiling Pool.  He builds it in much the same way\r\nthat Paddy builds his, but instead of sticks he cuts and uses\r\nrushes.  Of course it is not nearly as large as Paddy\'s house,\r\nbecause Jerry is himself so much smaller.  It is arranged much the\r\nsame, with a comfortable bedroom and one or more passages down to\r\ndeep water.  In winter Jerry spends much of his time in this house,\r\ngoing out only for food.  Then he lives chiefly on lily roots and\r\nroots of other water plants, digging them up and taking them back\r\nto his house to eat.  When the ice is clear you can sometimes see\r\nhim swimming below."\r\n\r\n"I know," spoke up Peter Rabbit.  "Once I was crossing the Smiling\r\nPool on the ice and saw him right under me."\r\n\r\n"Jerry doesn\'t build dams, but he sometimes digs little canals\r\nalong the bottom where the water isn\'t deep enough to suit him,"\r\ncontinued Old Mother Nature.  "Sometimes in the winter Jerry and\r\nMrs. Jerry share their home with two or three friends.  If there\r\nis a good bank Jerry usually has another home in that.  He makes\r\nthe entrance under water and then tunnels back and up for some\r\ndistance, where he builds a snug little bedroom just below the\r\nsurface of the ground where it is dry.  Usually he has more than\r\none tunnel leading to this, and sometimes an opening from above.\r\nThis is covered with sticks and grass to hide it, and provides\r\nan entrance for fresh air.\r\n\r\n"Jerry lives mostly on roots and plants, but is fond of mussels or\r\nfresh-water clams, fish, some insects and, I am sorry to say, young\r\nbirds when he can catch them.  Jerry could explain where some of\r\nthe babies of Mr. And Mrs. Quack the Ducks have disappeared to.\r\nPaddy the Beaver doesn\'t eat flesh at all.\r\n\r\n"Jerry and Mrs. Jerry have several families in a year, and Jerry\r\nis a very good father, doing his share in caring for the babies.\r\nHe and Mrs. Jerry are rather social and enjoy visiting neighbors\r\nof their own kind.  Their voices are a sort of squeak, and you can\r\noften hear them talking among the rushes in the early evening.\r\nThat is the hour they like best, though they are abroad during the\r\nday when undisturbed.  Man is their greatest enemy.  He hunts and\r\ntraps them for their warm coats.  But they have to watch out for\r\nHooty the Owl at night and for Reddy Fox and Old Man Coyote whenever\r\nthey are on land.  Billy Mink also is an enemy at times, perhaps\r\nthe most to be dreaded because he can follow Jerry anywhere.\r\n\r\n"Jerry makes little landings of mud and rushes along the edge of\r\nthe shore.  On these he delights to sit to eat his meals.  He likes\r\napples and vegetables and sometimes will travel quite a distance to\r\nget them.  Late in the summer he begins to prepare for winter by\r\nstarting work on his house, if he is to have a new one.  He is a\r\ngood worker.  There isn\'t a lazy bone in him.  All things considered,\r\nJerry is a credit to his family.\r\n\r\n"But if Jerry is a credit to his family there is one of its members\r\nwho is not and that is--who knows?"\r\n\r\n"Robber the Brown Rat," replied Happy Jack Squirrel promptly.  "I\r\nhave often seen him around Farmer Brown\'s barn.  Ugh!  He is an\r\nugly-looking fellow."\r\n\r\n"And he is just as ugly as he looks," replied Old Mother Nature.\r\n"There isn\'t a good thing I can say for him, not one.  He doesn\'t\r\nbelong in this country at all.  He was brought here by man, and\r\nnow he is found everywhere.  He is sometimes called the Norway Rat\r\nand sometimes the Wharf Rat and House Rat.  He is hated by all\r\nanimals and by man.  He is big, being next in size to Jerry\r\nMuskrat, savage in temper, the most destructive of any animal I\r\nknow, and dirty in his habits.  He is an outcast, but he doesn\'t\r\nseem to care.\r\n\r\n"He lives chiefly around the homes of men, and all his food is\r\nstolen.  That is why he is named Robber.  He eats anything he can\r\nfind and isn\'t the least bit particular what it is or whether it\r\nbe clean or unclean.  He gnaws into grain bins and steals the\r\ngrain.  He gets into hen-houses and sucks the eggs and kills young\r\nchickens.  He would like nothing better than to find a nest of\r\nyour babies, Peter Rabbit."\r\n\r\nPeter shivered.  "I\'m glad he sticks to the homes of men," said he.\r\n\r\n"But he doesn\'t," declared Old Mother Nature.  "Often in summer he\r\nmoves out into the fields, digging burrows there and doing great\r\ndamage to crops and also killing and eating any of the furred and\r\nfeathered folk he can catch.  But he is not fond of the light of\r\nday.  His deeds are deeds of darkness, and he prefers dark places.\r\nHe has very large families, sometimes ten or more babies at a time,\r\nand several families in a year.  That is why his tribe has managed\r\nto overrun the Great World and why they cause such great damage.\r\nWorse than the harm they do with their teeth is the terrible harm\r\nthey do to man by carrying dreadful diseases and spreading them--\r\ndiseases which cause people to die in great numbers."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t Robber afraid of any one?" asked Peter.\r\n\r\n"He certainly is," replied Old Mother Nature.  "He is in deadly fear\r\nof one whom every one of you fears--Shadow the Weasel.  One good\r\nthing I can say for Shadow is that he never misses a chance to kill\r\na Rat.  Wherever a Rat can go he can go, and once he finds a colony\r\nhe hunts them until he has killed all or driven them away.\r\n\r\n"When food becomes scarce, Robber and his family move on to where\r\nit is more plentiful.  Often they make long journeys, a great\r\nnumber of them together, and do not hesitate to swim a stream that\r\nmay be in their path."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never seen Robber," said Peter.  "What kind of a tail does\r\nhe have?"\r\n\r\n"I might have known you would ask that," laughed Old Mother Nature.\r\n"It is long and slim and has no hair on it.  His fur is very coarse\r\nand harsh and is brown and gray.  He has a close relative called\r\nthe Black Rat.  But the latter is smaller and has been largely\r\ndriven out of the country by his bigger cousin.  Now I guess this\r\nis enough about Robber.  He is bad, all bad, and hasn\'t a single\r\nfriend in all the Great World."\r\n\r\n"What a dreadful thing--not to have a single friend," said\r\nHappy Jack.\r\n\r\n"It is dreadful, very dreadful," replied Old Mother Nature.  "But\r\nit is wholly his own fault.  It shows what happens when one becomes\r\ndishonest and bad at heart.  The worst of it is Robber doesn\'t care.\r\nTo-morrow I\'ll tell you about some of his cousins who are not bad."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV  A Trader and a Handsome Fellow\r\n\r\n"Way down in the Sunny South," began Old Mother Nature, "lives a\r\nmember of the Rat family who, though not nearly so bad as Robber,\r\nis none too good and so isn\'t thought well of at all.  He is\r\nLittle Robber the Cotton Rat, and though small for a Rat, being\r\nonly a trifle larger than Striped Chipmunk, looks the little\r\nsavage that he is.  He has short legs and is rather thick-bodied,\r\nand appears much like an overgrown Meadow Mouse with a long tail.\r\nThe latter is not bare like Robber\'s, but the hair on it is very\r\nshort and thin.  In color he is yellowish-brown and whitish\r\nunderneath.  His fur is longer and coarser than that of other\r\nnative Rats.\r\n\r\n"He lives in old fields, along ditches and hedges, and in similar\r\nplaces where there is plenty of cover in which he can hide from\r\nhis enemies.  He burrows in the ground and usually has his nest of\r\ndry grass there, though often in summer it is the surface of the\r\nground.  He does not live in and around the homes of men, like the\r\nBrown Rat, but he causes a great deal of damage by stealing grain\r\nin the shock.  He eats all kinds of grain, many seeds, and meat\r\nwhen he can get it.  He is very destructive to eggs and young of\r\nground-nesting birds.  He has a bad temper and will fight savagely.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Cotton Rat raise several large families in a year.\r\nFoxes, Owls and Hawks are their chief enemies.\r\n\r\n"But there are other members of the Rat family far more interesting\r\nand quite worth knowing.  One of these is Trader the Wood Rat, in\r\nsome parts of the Far West called the Pack Rat.  Among the mountains\r\nhe is called the Mountain Rat.  Wherever found, his habits are much\r\nthe same and make him one of the most interesting of all the little\r\npeople who wear fur.\r\n\r\n"Next to Jerry Muskrat he is the largest native Rat, that is, of\r\nthe Rats which belong in this country.  He is about two thirds as\r\nbig as Robber the Brown Rat, but though he is of the same general\r\nshape, so that you would know at once that he is related to Robber,\r\nhe is in all other ways wholly unlike that outcast.  His fur is\r\nthick and soft, almost as soft as that of a Squirrel.  His fairly\r\nlong tail is covered with hair.  Indeed, some members of his branch\r\nof the family have tails almost as bushy as a Squirrel\'s.  His coat\r\nis soft gray and a yellowish-brown above, and underneath pure white\r\nor light buff.  His feet are white.  He has rounded ears and big\r\nblack eyes with none of the ugliness in them that you always see in\r\nthe eyes of Robber.  And he has long whiskers and plenty of them."\r\n\r\n"But why is he called Trader?" asked Rabbit a bit impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Patience, Peter, patience.  I\'m coming to that," chided Old Mother\r\nNature.  "He is Trader because his greatest delight is in trading.\r\nHe is a born trader if ever there was one.  He doesn\'t steal as\r\nother members of his family but trades.  He puts something back\r\nin place of whatever he takes.  It may be little sticks or chips\r\nor pebbles or anything else that is handy but it is something to\r\nreplace what he has taken.  You see, he is very honest.  If Trader\r\nfinds something belonging to some one else that he wants he takes\r\nit, but he tries to pay for it.\r\n\r\n"Next to trading he delights in collecting.  His home is a regular\r\nmuseum.  He delights in anything bright and shiny.  When he can\r\nget into the camps of men he will take anything he can move.  But\r\nbeing honest, he tries to leave something in return.  All sorts of\r\nqueer things are found in his home--buckles cut from saddles,\r\nspoons, knives, forks, even money he has taken from the pockets of\r\nsleeping campers.  Whenever any small object is missed from a camp,\r\nthe first place visited in search of it is the home of Trader.  In\r\nthe mountains he sometimes makes piles of little pebbles just for\r\nthe fun of collecting them.\r\n\r\n"He is found all over the West, from the mountains to the deserts,\r\nin thick forests and on sandy wastes.  He is also found in parts\r\nof the East and in the Sunny South.  He is a great climber and is\r\nperfectly at home in trees or among rocks.  He eats seeds, grain,\r\nmany kinds of nuts, leaves and other parts of plants.  In the\r\ncolder sections he lays up stores for winter."\r\n\r\n"What kind of a home does he have?" asked Happy Jack.\r\n\r\n"His home usually is a very remarkable affair," replied Old Mother\r\nNature.  "It depends largely on where he is.  When he is living in\r\nrocky country, he makes it amongst the rocks.  In some places he\r\nburrows in the ground.  But more often it is on the surface of the\r\nground--a huge pile of sticks and thorns in the very middle of\r\nwhich is his snug, soft nest.  The sticks and thorns are to protect\r\nit from enemies.  When he lives down where cactus grow, those queer\r\nplants with long sharp spines, he uses these, and there are few\r\nenemies who will try to pull one of these houses apart to get at him.\r\n\r\n"When he is alarmed or disturbed, he has a funny habit of drumming on\r\nthe ground with his hind feet in much the same way that Peter Rabbit\r\nand Jumper the Hare thump, only he does it rapidly.  Sometimes he\r\nbuilds his house in a tree.  When he finds a cabin in the woods he\r\nat once takes possession, carrying in a great mass of sticks and\r\ntrash.  He is chiefly active at night, and a very busy fellow he\r\nis, trading and collecting.  He has none of the mean disposition\r\nof Robber the Brown Rat.  Mrs. Trader has two to five babies at\r\na time and raises several families in a year.  As I said before,\r\nTrader is one of the most interesting little people I know of, and\r\nhe does very, very funny things.\r\n\r\n"Now we come to the handsomest member of the family, Longfoot the\r\nKangaroo Rat, so called because of his long hind legs and tail and\r\nthe way in which he sits up and jumps.  Really he is not a member\r\nof the Rat branch of the family, but closely related to the Pocket\r\nMice.  You see, he has pockets in his cheeks."\r\n\r\n"Like mine?" asked Striped Chipmunk quickly.\r\n\r\n"No, they are on the outside instead of the inside of his cheeks.\r\nYours are inside."\r\n\r\n"I think mine must be a lot handier," asserted Striped Chipmunk,\r\nnodding his head in a very decided way.\r\n\r\n"Longfoot seems to think his are quite satisfactory," replied Old\r\nMother Nature.  "He really is handsome, but he isn\'t a bit vain\r\nand is very gentle.  He never tries to bite when caught and taken\r\nin a man\'s hand."\r\n\r\n"But you haven\'t told us how big he is or what he looks like,"\r\nprotested impatient Peter.\r\n\r\n"When he sits up or jumps he looks like a tiny Kangaroo.  But that\r\ndoesn\'t mean anything to you, and you are no wiser than before,\r\nfor you never have seen a Kangaroo," replied Old Mother Nature.\r\n"In the first place he is about the size of Striped Chipmunk.\r\nThat is, his body is about the size of Striped Chipmunk\'s; but\r\nhis tail is longer than his head and body together."\r\n\r\n"My, it must be some tail!" exclaimed Peter Rabbit admiringly.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled.  "It is," said she.  "You would like that\r\ntail, Peter.  His front legs are short and the feet small, but his\r\nhind legs are long and the feet big.  Of course you have seen\r\nNimbleheels the Jumping Mouse, Peter."\r\n\r\nPeter nodded.  "Of course," he replied.  "My how that fellow can jump!"\r\n\r\n"Well, Longfoot is built on the same plan as Nimbleheels and for the\r\nsame purpose," continued Old Mother Nature.  "He is a jumper."\r\n\r\n"Then I know what that long tail is for," cried Peter.  "It is to\r\nkeep him balanced when he is in the air so that he can jump straight."\r\n\r\n"Right again, Peter," laughed Old Mother Nature.  "That is just what\r\nit is for.  Without it, he never would know where he was going to\r\nland when he jumped.  As I told you, he is a handsome little fellow.\r\nHis fur is very soft and silky.  Above, it is a pretty yellowish-brown,\r\nbut underneath it is pure white.  His cheeks are brown, he is white\r\naround the ears, and a white stripe crosses his hips and keeps right\r\non along the sides of his tail.  The upper and under parts of his\r\ntail are almost or quite black, and the tail ends in a tuft of long\r\nhair which is pure white.  His feet are also white.  His head is\r\nrather large for his size, and long.  He has a long nose.  Longfoot\r\nhas a number of cousins, some of them much smaller than he, but they\r\nall look very much alike."\r\n\r\n"Where do they live?" asked Johnny Chuck, for Johnny had been unable\r\nto stay away from school another day.\r\n\r\n"In the dry, sandy parts of the Southwest, places so dry that it\r\nseldom rains, and water is to be found only long distances apart,"\r\nreplied Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Then how does Longfoot get water to drink?" demanded Chatterer the\r\nRed Squirrel.\r\n\r\n"He gets along without drinking," replied Old Mother Nature.  "Such\r\nmoisture as he needs he gets from his food.  He eats seeds, leaves\r\nof certain plants and tender young plants just coming up.  He\r\nburrows in the ground and throws up large mounds of earth.  These\r\nhave several entrances.  One of these is the main entrance, and\r\nduring the day this is often kept closed with earth.  Under the\r\nmound he has little tunnels in all directions, a snug little bedroom\r\nand storerooms for food.  He is very industrious and dearly loves\r\nto dig.\r\n\r\n"Longfoot likes to visit his relatives sometimes, and where there\r\nare several families living near together, little paths lead from\r\nmound to mound.  He comes out mostly at night, probably because he\r\nfeels it to be safer then.  Then, too, in that hot country it is\r\ncooler at night.  The dusk of early evening is his favorite\r\nplaytime.  If Longfoot has a quarrel with one of his relatives they\r\nfight, hopping about each other, watching for a chance to leap and\r\nkick with those long, strong hind feet.  Longfoot sometimes drums\r\nwith his hind feet after the manner of Trader the Wood Rat.\r\n\r\n"Now I think this will do for this morning.  If any of you should\r\nmeet Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, tell him to come to school to-morrow\r\nmorning.  And you might tell Danny Meadow if you little folks want\r\nschool to continue."\r\n\r\n"We do!" cried Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and Happy Jack\r\nSquirrel and Chatterer the Red Squirrel and Striped Chipmunk and\r\nJohnny Chuck as one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV  Two Unlike Little Cousins\r\n\r\nWhitefoot the Wood Mouse is one of the smallest of the little people\r\nwho live in the Green Forest.  Being so small he is one of the most\r\ntimid.  You see, by day and by night sharp eyes are watching for\r\nWhitefoot and he knows it.  Never one single instant, while he is\r\noutside where sharp eyes of hungry enemies may see him, does he\r\nforget that they are watching for him.  To forget even for one little\r\nminute might mean--well, it might mean the end of little Whitefoot,\r\nbut a dinner for some one with a liking for tender Mouse.\r\n\r\nSo Whitefoot the Wood Mouse rarely ventures more than a few feet\r\nfrom a hiding place and safety.  At the tiniest sound he starts\r\nnervously and often darts back into hiding without waiting to find\r\nout if there really is any danger.  If he waited to make sure he\r\nmight wait too long, and it is better to be safe than sorry.  If you\r\nand I had as many real frights in a year, not to mention false frights,\r\nas Whitefoot has in a day, we would, I suspect, lose our minds.\r\nCertainly we would be the most unhappy people in all the Great World.\r\n\r\nBut Whitefoot isn\'t unhappy.  Not a bit of it.  He is a very happy\r\nlittle fellow.  There is a great deal of wisdom in that pretty\r\nlittle head of his.  There is more real sense in it than in some\r\nvery big heads.  When some of his neighbors make fun of him for\r\nbeing so very, very timid he doesn\'t try to pretend that he isn\'t\r\nafraid.  He doesn\'t get angry.  He simply says:\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'m timid, very timid indeed.  I\'m afraid of almost\r\neverything.  I would be foolish not to be.  It is because I am\r\nafraid that I am alive and happy right now.  I hope I shall never\r\nbe less timid than I am now, for it would mean that sooner or\r\nlater I would fail to run in time and would be gobbled up.  It\r\nisn\'t cowardly to be timid when there is danger all around.  Nor\r\nis it bravery to take a foolish and needless risk.  So I seldom\r\ngo far from home.  It isn\'t safe for me, and I know it."\r\n\r\nThis being the way Whitefoot looked at matters, you can guess how\r\nhe felt when Chatterer the Red Squirrel caught sight of him and\r\ngave him Old Mother Nature\'s message.\r\n\r\n"Hi there, Mr. Fraidy!" shouted Chatterer, as he caught sight\r\nof Whitefoot darting under a log.  "Hi there!  I\'ve got a message\r\nfor you!"\r\n\r\nSlowly, cautiously, Whitefoot poked his head out from beneath the\r\nold log and looked up at Chatterer.  "What kind of a message?" he\r\ndemanded suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"A message you\'ll do well to heed.  It is from Old Mother Nature,"\r\nreplied Chatterer.\r\n\r\n"A message from Old Mother Nature!" cried Whitefoot, and came out\r\na bit more from beneath the old log.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I said, a message from Old Mother Nature, and if you\r\nwill take my advice you will heed it," retorted Chatterer.  "She\r\nsays you are to come to school with the rest of us at sun-up\r\nto-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nThen Chatterer explained about the school and where it was held\r\neach morning and what a lot he and his friends had already learned\r\nthere.  Whitefoot listened with something very like dismay in his\r\nheart.  That place where school was held was a long way off.  That\r\nis, it was a long way for him, though to Peter Rabbit or Jumper the\r\nHare it wouldn\'t have seemed long at all.  It meant that he would\r\nhave to leave all his hiding places and the thought made him shiver.\r\n\r\nBut Old Mother Nature had sent for him and not once did he even\r\nthink of disobeying.  "Did you say that school begins at sun-up?"\r\nhe asked, and when Chatterer nodded Whitefoot sighed.  It was a\r\nsigh of relief.  "I\'m glad of that," said he.  "I can travel in\r\nthe night, which will be much safer.  I\'ll be there.  That is, I\r\nwill if I am not caught on the way."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile over on the Green Meadows Peter Rabbit was looking for\r\nDanny Meadow Mouse.  Danny\'s home was not far from the dear Old\r\nBriar-patch, and he and Peter were and still are very good friends.\r\nSo Peter knew just about where to look for Danny and it didn\'t\r\ntake him long to find him.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Peter!  You look as if you have something very important\r\non your mind," was the greeting of Danny Meadow Mouse as Peter\r\ncame hurrying up.\r\n\r\n"I have," said Peter.  "It is a message for you.  Old Mother Nature\r\nsays for you to be on hand at sun-up to-morrow when school opens\r\nover in the Green Forest.  Of course you will be there."\r\n\r\n"Of course," replied Danny in the most matter-of-fact tone.  "Of\r\ncourse.  If Old Mother Nature really sent me that message--"\r\n\r\n"She really did," interrupted Peter.\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t anything for me to do but obey," finished Danny.  Then\r\nhis face became very sober.  "That is a long way for me to go,\r\nPeter," said he.  "I wouldn\'t take such a long journey for anything\r\nor for anybody else.  Old Mother Nature knows, and if she sent for\r\nme she must be sure I can make the trip safely.  What time did you\r\nsay I must be there?"\r\n\r\n"At sun-up," replied Peter.  "Shall I call for you on my way there?"\r\n\r\nDanny shook his head.  Then he began to laugh.  "What are you\r\nlaughing at?" demanded Peter.\r\n\r\n"At the very idea of me with my short legs trying to keep up with\r\nyou," replied Danny.  "I wish you would sit up and take a good\r\nlook all around to make sure that Old Man Coyote and Reddy Fox and\r\nRedtail the Hawk and Black Pussy, that pesky Cat from Farmer Brown\'s,\r\nare nowhere about."\r\n\r\nPeter obligingly sat up and looked this way and looked that way and\r\nlooked the other way.  No one of whom he or Danny Meadow Mouse need\r\nbe afraid was to be seen.  He said as much, then asked, "Why did\r\nyou want to know, Danny?"\r\n\r\n"Because I am going to start at once," replied Danny.\r\n\r\n"Start for where?" asked Peter, looking much puzzled.\r\n\r\n"Start for school of course," replied Danny rather shortly.\r\n\r\n"But school doesn\'t begin until sun-up to-morrow," protested Peter.\r\n\r\n"Which is just the reason I am going to start now," retorted Danny.\r\n"If I should put off starting until the last minute I might not\r\nget there at all.  I would have to hurry, and it is difficult to\r\nhurry and watch for danger at the same time.  I\'ve noticed that\r\npeople who put things off to the last minute and then have to\r\nhurry are quite apt to rush headlong into trouble.  The way is\r\nclear now, so I am going to start.  I can take my time and keep\r\na proper watch for danger.  I\'ll see you over there in the\r\nmorning, Peter."\r\n\r\nDanny turned and disappeared in one of his private little paths\r\nthough the tall grass.  Peter noticed that he was headed towards\r\nthe Green Forest.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter and the others arrived for school the next morning they\r\nfound Whitefoot the Wood Mouse and Danny Meadow Mouse waiting with\r\nOld Mother Nature.  Safe in her presence, they seemed to have lost\r\nmuch of their usual timidity.  Whitefoot was sitting on the end of\r\na log and Danny was on the ground just beneath him.\r\n\r\n"I want all the rest of you to look well at these two little cousins\r\nand notice how unlike two cousins can be," said Old Mother Nature.\r\n"Whitefoot, who is quite as often called Deer Mouse as Wood Mouse,\r\nis one of the prettiest of the entire Mouse family.  I suspect he\r\nis called Deer Mouse because the upper part of his coat is such a\r\nbeautiful fawn color.  Notice that the upper side of his long slim\r\ntail is of the same color, while the under side is white, as is the\r\nwhole under part of Whitefoot.  Also those dainty feet are white,\r\nhence his name.  See what big, soft black eyes he has, and notice\r\nthat those delicate ears are of good size.\r\n\r\n"His tail is covered with short fine hairs, instead of being naked\r\nas is the tail of Nibbler the House mouse, of whom I will tell you\r\nlater.  Whitefoot loves the Green Forest, but out in parts of the\r\nFar West where there is no Green Forest he lives on the brushy\r\nplains.  He is a good climber and quite at home in the trees.\r\nThere he seems almost like a tiny Squirrel.  Tell us, Whitefoot,\r\nwhere you make your home and what you eat."\r\n\r\n"My home just now," replied Whitefoot, "is in a certain hollow in a\r\ncertain dead limb of a certain tree.  I suspect that a member of the\r\nWoodpecker family made that hollow, but no one was living there when\r\nI found it.  Mrs. Whitefoot and I have made a soft, warm nest there\r\nand wouldn\'t trade homes with any one.  We have had our home in a\r\nhollow log on the ground, in an old stump, in a hole we dug in the\r\nground under a rock, and in an old nest of some bird.  That was in\r\na tall bush.  We roofed that nest over and make a little round\r\ndoorway on the under side.  Once we raised a family in a box in a\r\ndark corner of Farmer Brown\'s sugar camp.\r\n\r\n"I eat all sorts of things--seeds, nuts, insects and meat when I\r\ncan get it.  I store up food for winter, as all wise and thrifty\r\npeople do."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that means that you do not sleep as Johnny Chuck does in\r\nwinter," remarked Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"I should say not!" exclaimed Whitefoot.  "I like winter.  It is fun\r\nto run about on the snow.  Haven\'t you ever seen my tracks, Peter?"\r\n\r\n"I have, lots of times," spoke up Jumper the Hare.  "Also I\'ve seen you\r\nskipping about after dark.  I guess you don\'t care much for sunlight."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t," replied Whitefoot.  "I sleep most of the time during the\r\nday, and work and play at night.  I feel safer then.  But on dull\r\ndays I often come out.  It is the bright sunlight I don\'t like.  That\r\nis one reason I stick to the Green Forest.  I don\'t see how Cousin\r\nDanny stands it out there on the Green Meadows.  Now I guess it is\r\nhis turn."\r\n\r\nEvery one looked at Danny Meadow Mouse.  In appearance he was as\r\nunlike Whitefoot as it was possible to be and still be a Mouse.\r\nThere was nothing pretty or graceful about Danny.  He wasn\'t dainty\r\nat all.  His body was rather stout, looking stouter than it really\r\nwas because his fur was quite long.  His head was blunt, and he\r\nseemed to have no neck at all, though of course he did have one.\r\nHis eyes were small, like little black beads.  His ears were almost\r\nhidden in his hair.  His legs were short and his tail was quite\r\nshort, as if it had been cut off when half grown.  No, those two\r\ncousins didn\'t look a bit alike.  Danny felt most uncomfortable\r\nas the others compared him with pretty Whitefoot.  He knew he was\r\nhomely, but never before had he felt it quite so keenly.  Old\r\nMother Nature saw and understood.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t how we look, but what we are and what we do and how we\r\nfit into our particular places in life that count," said she.\r\n"Now, Danny is a homely little fellow, but I know, and I know that\r\nhe knows that he is just fitted for the life he lives, and he lives\r\nit more successfully for being just as he is.\r\n\r\n"Danny is a lover of the fields and meadows where there is little\r\nelse but grass in which to hide.  Everything about him is just\r\nsuited for living there.  Isn\'t that so, Danny?"\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m, I guess so," replied Danny.  "Sometimes my tail does seem\r\ndreadfully short to look well."\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed, even Danny himself.  Then he remembered how once\r\nReddy Fox had so nearly caught him that one of Reddy\'s black paws\r\nhad touched the tip of his tail.  Had that tail been any longer\r\nReddy would have caught him by it.  Danny\'s face cleared and he\r\nhastened to declare, "After all, my tail suits me just as it is."\r\n\r\n"Wisely spoken, Danny," said Old Mother Nature.  "Now it is your\r\nturn to tell how you live and what you eat and anything else of\r\ninterest about yourself."\r\n\r\n"I guess there isn\'t much interesting about me," began Danny\r\nmodestly.  "I\'m just one of the plain, common little folks.\r\nI guess everybody knows me so well there is nothing for me\r\nto tell."\r\n\r\n"Some of them may know all about you, but I don\'t," declared\r\nJumper the Hare.  "I never go out on the Green Meadows where you\r\nlive.  How do you get about in all that tall grass?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s easy enough," replied Danny.  "I cut little paths in\r\nall directions."\r\n\r\n"Just the way I do in the dear Old Briar-patch," interrupted\r\nPeter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"I keep those little paths clear and clean so that there never is\r\nanything in my way to trip me up when I have to run for safety,"\r\ncontinued Danny.  "When the grass gets tall those little paths are\r\nalmost like little tunnels.  The time I dread most is when Farmer\r\nBrown cuts the grass for hay.  I not only have to watch out for that\r\ndreadful mowing machine, but when the hay has been taken away the\r\ngrass is so short that it is hard work for me to keep out of sight.\r\n\r\n"I sometimes dig a short burrow and at the end of it make a nice nest\r\nof dry grass.  Sometimes in summer Mrs. Danny and I make our nest on\r\nthe surface of the ground in a hollow or in a clump of tall grass,\r\nespecially if the ground is low and wet.  We have several good-sized\r\nfamilies in a year.  All Meadow Mice believe in large families, and\r\nthat is probably why there are more Meadow Mice than any other Mice\r\nin the country.  I forgot to say that I am also called Field Mouse."\r\n\r\n"And it is because there are so many of your family and they require\r\nso much to eat that you do a great deal of damage to grass and other\r\ncrops," spoke up Old Mother Nature.  "You see," she explained to the\r\nothers, "Danny eats grass, clover, bulbs, roots, seeds and garden\r\nvegetables.  He also eats some insects.  He sometimes puts away a\r\nfew seeds for the winter, but depends chiefly on finding enough to\r\neat, for he is active all winter.  He tunnels about under the snow\r\nin search of food.  When other food is hard to find he eats bark,\r\nand then he sometimes does great damage in young orchards.  He gnaws\r\nthe bark from young fruit trees all the way around as high as he\r\ncan reach, and of course this kills the trees.  He is worse than\r\nPeter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Danny didn\'t mention that he is a good swimmer and not at all\r\nafraid of the water.  No one has more enemies than he, and the fact\r\nthat he is alive and here at school this morning is due to his\r\neverlasting watchfulness.  This will do for to-day.  To-morrow we\r\nwill take up others of the Mouse family."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI  Danny\'s Northern Cousins and Nimbleheels\r\n\r\nWhitefoot the Wood Mouse and Danny Meadow Mouse had become so\r\ninterested that they decided they couldn\'t afford to miss the next\r\nlesson.  Neither did either of them feel like making the long\r\njourney to his home and back again.  So Whitefoot found a hole in\r\na stump near by and decided to camp out there for a few days.  Danny\r\ndecided to do the same thing in a comfortable place under a pile of\r\nbrush not far away.  So the next morning both were on hand when\r\nschool opened.\r\n\r\n"I told you yesterday that I would tell you about some of Danny\'s\r\ncousins," began Old Mother Nature just as Chatterer the Red Squirrel,\r\nwho was late, came hurrying up quite out of breath.  "Way up in the\r\nFar North are two of Danny\'s cousins more closely related to him\r\nthan to any other members of the Mouse family.  Yet, strange to say,\r\nthey are not called Mice at all, but Lemmings.  However, they belong\r\nto the Mouse family.\r\n\r\n"Bandy the Banded Lemming is the most interesting, because he is\r\nthe one member of the entire family who changes the color of his\r\ncoat.  In summer he wears beautiful shades of reddish brown and\r\ngray, but in winter his coat is wholly white.  He is also called\r\nthe Hudson Bay Lemming.\r\n\r\n"Danny Meadow Mouse thinks his tail is short, but he wouldn\'t if\r\nhe should see Bandy\'s tail.  That is so short it hardly shows beyond\r\nhis long fur.  He is about Danny\'s size, but a little stouter and\r\nstockier, and his long fur makes him appear even thicker-bodied than\r\nhe really is.  He has very short legs, and his ears are so small\r\nthat they are quite hidden in the fur around them, so that he appears\r\nto have no ears at all.\r\n\r\n"In that same far northern country is a close relative called the\r\nBrown Lemming.  He is very much like Bandy save that he is all brown\r\nand does not change his coat in winter.  Both have the same general\r\nhabits, and these are much like the habits of Danny Meadow Mouse.\r\nThey make short burrows in the ground leading to snug, warm nests of\r\ngrass and moss.  In winter they make little tunnels in every direction\r\nunder the snow, with now and then an opening to the surface.\r\n\r\n"There are many more Brown Lemmings than Banded Lemmings, and their\r\nlittle paths run everywhere through the grass and moss.  In that\r\ncountry there is a great deal of moss.  It covers the ground just\r\nas grass does here.  But the most interesting thing about these\r\nLemmings is the way they migrate.  To migrate is to move from one\r\npart of the country to another.  You know most of the birds migrate\r\nto the Sunny South every autumn and back every spring.\r\n\r\n"Once in a while it happens that food becomes very scarce where\r\nthe Lemmings are.  Then very many of them get together, just as\r\nmigrating birds form great flocks, and start on a long journey in\r\nsearch of a place where there is plenty of food.  They form a great\r\narmy and push ahead, regardless of everything.  They swim wide\r\nrivers and even lakes which may lie in their way.  Of course, they\r\neat everything eatable in their path."\r\n\r\n"My!" exclaimed Danny Meadow Mouse, "I\'m glad I don\'t live in a\r\ncountry where I might have to make such long journeys.  I don\'t\r\nenvy those cousins up there in the Far North a bit.  I\'m perfectly\r\nsatisfied to live right on the Green Meadows."\r\n\r\n"Which shows your good common sense," said Old Mother Nature.  "By\r\nthe way, Danny, I suppose you are acquainted with Nimbleheels the\r\nJumping Mouse, who also is rather fond of the Green Meadows.  I\r\nought to have sent word to him to be here this morning."\r\n\r\nHardly were the words out of Old Mother Nature\'s mouth when something\r\nlanded in the leaves almost at her feet and right in the middle of\r\nschool.  Instantly Danny Meadow Mouse scurried under a pile of dead\r\nleaves.  Whitefoot the Wood Mouse darted into a knothole in the log\r\non which he had been sitting.  Jumper the Hare dodged behind a\r\nlittle hemlock tree.  Peter Rabbit bolted for a hollow log.  Striped\r\nChipmunk vanished in a hole under an old stump.  Johnny Chuck backed\r\nup against the trunk of a tree and made ready to fight.  Only Happy\r\nJack the Gray Squirrel and Chatterer the Red Squirrel and Prickly\r\nPorky the Porcupine, who were sitting in trees, kept their places.\r\nYou see they felt quite safe.\r\n\r\nAs soon as all those who had run had reached places of safety,\r\nthey peeped out to see what had frightened them so.  Just imagine\r\nhow very, very foolish they felt when they saw Old Mother Nature\r\nsmiling down at a little fellow just about the size of little\r\nWhitefoot, but with a much longer tail.  It was Nimbleheels the\r\nJumping Mouse.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, well," exclaimed Old Mother Nature.  "I was just\r\nspeaking of you and wishing I had you here.  How did you happen\r\nto come?  And what do you mean by scaring my pupils half out of\r\ntheir wits?"  Her eyes twinkled.  Nimbleheels saw this and knew\r\nthat she was only pretending to be severe.\r\n\r\nBefore he could reply Johnny Chuck began to chuckle.  The chuckle\r\nbecame a laugh, and presently Johnny was laughing so hard he had\r\nto hold his sides.  Now, as you know, laughter is catching.  In a\r\nminute or so everybody was laughing, and no one but Johnny Chuck\r\nknew what the joke was.  At last Peter Rabbit stopped laughing\r\nlong enough to ask Johnny what he was laughing at.\r\n\r\n"At the idea of that little pinch of nothing giving us all such a\r\nfright," replied Johnny Chuck.  Then all laughed some more.\r\n\r\nWhen they were through laughing Nimbleheels answered Old Mother\r\nNature\'s questions.  He explained that he had heard about that\r\nschool, as by this time almost every one in the Green Forest and\r\non the Green Meadows had.  By chance he learned that Danny Meadow\r\nMouse was attending.  He thought that if it was a good thing for\r\nDanny it would be a good thing for him, so he had come.\r\n\r\n"Just as I was almost here I heard a twig snap behind me, or thought\r\nI did, and I jumped so as to get here and be safe.  I didn\'t\r\nsuppose anyone would be frightened by little me," he explained.\r\n"It was some jump!" exclaimed Jumper the Hare admiringly.  "He\r\nwent right over my head, and I was sitting up at that!"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t much of a jump to go over your head," replied Nimbleheels.\r\n"You ought to see me when I really try to jump.  I wasn\'t half\r\ntrying when I landed here.  I\'m sorry I frightened all of you so.\r\nIt gives me a queer feeling just to think that I should be able\r\nto frighten anybody.  If you please, Mother Nature, am I in time\r\nfor to-day\'s lesson?"\r\n\r\n"Not for all of it, but you are just in time for the part I wanted\r\nyou here for," replied Old Mother Nature.  "Hop up on that log\r\nside of your Cousin Whitefoot, where all can see you."\r\n\r\nNimbleheels hopped up beside Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, and as the\r\ntwo little cousins sat side by side they were not unlike in general\r\nappearance, though of the two Whitefoot was the prettier.  The coat\r\nof Nimbleheels was a dull yellowish, darker on the back than on the\r\nsides.  Like Whitefoot he was white underneath.  His ears were much\r\nsmaller than those of Whitefoot.  But the greatest differences\r\nbetween the two were in their hind legs and tails.\r\n\r\nThe hind legs and feet of Nimbleheels were long, on the same plan\r\nas those of Peter Rabbit.  From just a glance at them any one\r\nwould know that he was a born jumper and a good one.  Whitefoot\r\npossessed a long tail, but the tail of Nimbleheels was much\r\nlonger, slim and tapering.\r\n\r\n"There," said Old Mother Nature, "is the greatest jumper for his\r\nsize among all the animals in this great country.  When I say this,\r\nI mean the greatest ground jumper.  Timmy the Flying Squirrel\r\njumps farther, but Timmy has to climb to a high place and then\r\ncoasts down on the air.  I told you what wonderful jumps Jack\r\nRabbit can make, but if he could jump as high and far for his size\r\nas Nimbleheels can jump for his size, the longest jump Jack has\r\never made would seem nothing more than a hop.  By the way, both\r\nNimbleheels and Whitefoot have small pockets in their cheeks.\r\nTell us where you live, Nimbleheels."\r\n\r\n"I live among the weeds along the edge of the Green Meadows,"\r\nreplied Nimbleheels, "though sometimes I go way out on the Green\r\nMeadows.  But I like best to be among the weeds because they are\r\ntall and keep me well hidden, and also because they furnish me\r\nplenty to eat.  You see, I live largely on seeds, though I am also\r\nfond of berries and small nuts, especially beechnuts.  Some of my\r\nfamily prefer the Green Forest, especially if there is a Laughing\r\nBrook or pond in it. Personally I prefer, as I said before, the\r\nedge of the Green Meadows."\r\n\r\n"Do you make your home under the ground?" asked Striped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"For winter, yes," replied Nimbleheels.  "In summer I sometimes\r\nput my nest just a few inches under ground, but often I hide it\r\nunder a piece of bark or in a thick clump of grass, just as Danny\r\nMeadow Mouse often does his.  In the fall I dig a deep burrow,\r\ndeep enough to be beyond the reach of Jack Frost, and in a nice\r\nlittle bedroom down there I sleep the winter away.  I have little\r\nstorerooms down there too, in which I put seeds, berries and nuts.\r\nThen when I do wake up I have plenty to eat."\r\n\r\n"I might add," said Old Mother Nature, "that when he goes to sleep\r\nfor the winter he curls up in a little ball with his long tail\r\nwrapped around him, and in his bed of soft grass he sleeps very\r\nsound indeed.  Like Johnny Chuck he gets very fat before going to\r\nsleep.  Now, Nimbleheels, show us how you can jump."\r\n\r\nNimbleheels hopped down from the log on which he had been sitting\r\nand at once shot into the air in such a high, long, beautiful jump\r\nthat everybody exclaimed.  This way and that way he went in great\r\nleaps.  It was truly wonderful.\r\n\r\n"That long tail is what balances him," explained Old Mother Nature.\r\n"If he should lose it he would simply turn over and over and never\r\nknow where or how he was going to land.  His jumping is done only\r\nin times of danger.  When he is not alarmed he runs about on the\r\nground like the rest of the Mouse family.  This is all for to-day.\r\nTo-morrow I will tell you still more about the Mouse family."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII  Three Little Redcoats and Some Others\r\n\r\nWith Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, Danny Meadow Mouse and Nimbleheels\r\nthe Jumping Mouse attending school, the Mouse family was well\r\nrepresented, but when school opened the morning after Nimbleheels\r\nhad made his sudden and startling appearance, there was still\r\nanother present.  It was Piney the Pine Mouse.  Whitefoot, who\r\nknew him, had hunted him up and brought him along.\r\n\r\n"I thought you wouldn\'t mind if Piney came," explained Whitefoot.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad he has come," replied Old Mother Nature.  "It is much\r\nbetter to see a thing than merely to be told about it, and now you\r\nhave a chance to see for yourselves the differences between two\r\ncousins very closely related, Danny Meadow Mouse and Piney the\r\nPine Mouse.  What difference do you see, Happy Jack Squirrel?"\r\n\r\n"Piney is a little smaller than Danny, though he is much the same\r\nshape," was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\n"True," said Old Mother Nature.  "Now, Striped Chipmunk, what\r\ndifference do you see?"\r\n\r\n"The fur of Piney\'s coat is shorter, finer and has more of a shine.\r\nThen, too, it is more of a reddish-brown than Danny\'s," replied\r\nStriped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"And what do you say, Peter Rabbit?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Piney has a shorter tail," declared Peter, and everybody laughed.\r\n\r\n"Trust you to look at his tail first," said Old Mother Nature.\r\n"These are the chief differences as far as looks are concerned.\r\nTheir habits differ in about the same degree.  As you all know,\r\nDanny cuts little paths through the grass.  Piney doesn\'t do this,\r\nbut makes little tunnels just under the surface of the ground very\r\nmuch as Miner the Mole does.  He isn\'t fond of the open Green\r\nMeadows or of damp places as Danny is, but likes best the edge of\r\nthe Green Forest and brushy places.  He is very much at home in a\r\npoorly kept orchard where the weeds are allowed to grow and in young\r\norchards he does a great deal of damage by cutting off the roots of\r\nyoung trees and stripping off the bark as high up as he can reach.\r\nTell us, Piney, how and where you make your home."\r\n\r\nPiney hesitated a little, for he was bashful.  "I make my home under\r\nground," he ventured finally.  "I dig a nice little bedroom with\r\nseveral entrances from my tunnels, and in it I make a fine nest of\r\nsoft grass.  Close by I dig one or more rooms in which to store my\r\nfood, and these usually are bigger than my bedroom.  When I get one\r\nfilled with food I close it up by filling the entrance with earth."\r\n\r\n"What do you put in your storerooms?" asked Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Short pieces of grass and pieces of roots of different kinds,"\r\nreplied Piney.  "I am very fond of tender roots and the bark of\r\ntrees and bushes.\r\n\r\n"And he dearly loves to get in a garden where he can tunnel along\r\na row of potatoes or other root crops," added Old Mother Nature.\r\n"Because of these habits he does a great deal of damage and is much\r\ndisliked by man.  Striped Chipmunk mentioned his reddish-brown coat.\r\nThere is another cousin with a coat so red that he is called the\r\nRed-backed Mouse.  He is about the size of Danny Meadow Mouse but\r\nhas larger ears and a longer tail.\r\n\r\n"This little fellow is a lover of the Green Forest, and he is quite\r\nas active by day as by night.  He is pretty, especially when he sits\r\nup to eat, holding his food in his paws as does Happy Jack Squirrel.\r\nHe makes his home in a burrow, the entrance to which is under an old\r\nstump, a rock or the root of a tree.  His nest is of soft grass or\r\nmoss.  Sometimes he makes it in a hollow log or stump instead of\r\ndigging a bedroom under ground.  He is thrifty and lays up a supply\r\nof food in underground rooms, hollow logs and similar places.  He\r\neats seeds, small fruits, roots and various plants.  Because of\r\nhis preference for the Green Forest and the fact that he lives as\r\na rule far from the homes of men, he does little real damage.\r\n\r\n"There is still another little Redcoat in the family, and he is\r\nespecially interesting because while he is related to Danny Meadow\r\nMouse he lives almost wholly in trees.  He is called the Rufous\r\nTree Mouse.  Rufous means reddish-brown, and he gets that name\r\nbecause of the color of his coat.  He lives in the great forests\r\nof the Far West, where the trees are so big and tall that the\r\nbiggest tree you have ever seen would look small beside them.  And\r\nit is in those great trees that the Rufous Tree Mouse lives.\r\n\r\n"Just why he took to living in trees no one knows, for he belongs\r\nto that branch of the family known as Ground Mice.  But live in\r\nthem he does, and he is quite as much at home in them as\r\nany Squirrel."\r\n\r\nChatterer the Red Squirrel was interested right away.  "Does he\r\nbuild a nest in a tree like a Squirrel?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"He certainly does," replied Old Mother Nature, "and often it is a\r\nmost remarkable nest.  In some sections he places it only in big\r\ntrees, sometimes a hundred feet from the ground.  In other sections\r\nit is placed in small trees and only a few feet above the ground.\r\nThe high nests often are old deserted nests of Squirrels enlarged\r\nand built over.  Some of them are very large indeed and have been\r\nused year after year.  Each year they have been added to.\r\n\r\n"One of these big nests will have several bedrooms and little\r\npassages running all through it.  It appears that Mrs. Rufous\r\nusually has one of these big nests to herself, Rufous having\r\na small nest of his own out on one of the branches.  The big\r\nnest is close up against the trunk of the tree where several\r\nbranches meet."\r\n\r\n"Does Rufous travel from one tree to another, or does he live in\r\njust one tree?" asked Happy Jack Squirrel.\r\n\r\n"Wherever branches of one tree touch those of another, and you\r\nknow in a thick forest this is frequently the case, he travels\r\nabout freely if he wants to.  But those trees are so big that I\r\nsuspect he spends most of his time in the one in which his home\r\nis," replied Old Mother Nature.  "However, if an enemy appears\r\nin his home tree, he makes his escape by jumping from one tree\r\nto another, just as you would do."\r\n\r\n"What I want to know is where he gets his food if he spends all\r\nhis time up in the trees," spoke up Danny Meadow Mouse.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled.  "Where should he get it but up where\r\nhe lives?" she asked.  "Rufous never has to worry about food.  It\r\nis all around him.  You see, so far as known, he lives wholly on\r\nthe thick parts of the needles, which you know are the leaves, of\r\nfir and spruce trees, and on the bark of tender twigs.  So you\r\nsee he is more of a tree dweller than any of the Squirrel family.\r\nWhile Rufous has the general shape of Danny and his relatives, he\r\nhas quite a long tail.  Now I guess this will do for the nearest\r\nrelatives of Danny Meadow Mouse."\r\n\r\n"He certainly has a lot of them," remarked Whitefoot the Wood Mouse.\r\nThen he added a little wistfully, "Of course, in a way they are all\r\ncousins of mine, but I wish I had some a little more closely related."\r\n\r\n"You have," replied Old Mother Nature, and Whitefoot pricked up\r\nhis big ears.  "One of them Bigear the Rock Mouse, who lives out\r\nin the mountains of the Far West.  He is as fond of the rocks as\r\nRufous is of the trees.  Sometimes he lives in brush heaps and in\r\nbrushy country, but he prefers rocks, and that is why he is known\r\nas the Rock Mouse.\r\n\r\n"He is a pretty little fellow, if anything a trifle bigger than you,\r\nWhitefoot, and he is dressed much like you with a yellowish-brown\r\ncoat and white waistcoat.  He has just such a long tail covered\r\nwith hair its whole length.  But you should see his ears.  He has\r\nthe largest ears of any member of the whole family.  That is why\r\nhe is called Bigear.  He likes best to be out at night, but often\r\ncomes out on dull days.  He eats seeds and small nuts and is\r\nespecially fond of juniper seeds.  He always lays up a supply of\r\nfood for winter.  Often he is found very high up on the mountains.\r\n\r\n"Another of your cousins, Whitefoot, lives along the seashore of\r\nthe East down in the Sunny South.  He is called the Beach Mouse.\r\nIn general appearance he is much like you, having the same shape,\r\nlong tail and big ears, but he is a little smaller and his coat\r\nvaries.  When he lives back from the shore, in fields where the\r\nsoil is dark, his upper coat is dark grayish-brown, but when he\r\nlives on the white sands of the seashore it is very light.  His\r\nhome is in short burrows in the ground.\r\n\r\n"Now don\'t you little people think you have learned enough about\r\nthe Mouse family?"\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t told us about Nibbler the House Mouse yet.  And you\r\nsaid you would," protested Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"And when we were learning about Longfoot the Kangaroo Rat you said\r\nhe was most closely related to the Pocket Mice.  What about them?"\r\nsaid Johnny Chuck.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed.  "I see," said she, "that you want to\r\nknow all there is to know.  Be on hand to-morrow morning.  I guess\r\nwe can finish up with the Mouse family then and with them the order\r\nof Rodents to which all of you belong."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII  Mice with Pockets, and Others\r\n\r\n"Pockets are very handy things for little people who are thrifty\r\nand who live largely on small seeds.  Without pockets in which to\r\ncarry the seeds, I am afraid some of them would never be able to\r\nstore up enough food for winter," began Old Mother Nature, as soon\r\nas everybody was on hand the next morning.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t be without my pockets for any thing," spoke up\r\nStriped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled.  "You certainly do make good use of yours,"\r\nsaid she.  "But there are others who have even greater need of\r\npockets, and among them are the Pocket Mice.  Of course, it is\r\nbecause of their pockets that they are called Pocket Mice.  All of\r\nthese pretty little fellows live in the dry parts of the Far West\r\nand Southwest in the same region where Longfoot the Kangaroo Rat\r\nlives.  They are close neighbors and relatives of his.\r\n\r\n"Midget the Silky Pocket Mouse is one of the smallest animals in\r\nall the Great World, so small that Whitefoot the Wood Mouse is a\r\ngiant compared with him.  He weighs less than an ounce and is a\r\ndear little fellow.  His back and sides are yellow, and beneath\r\nhe is white.  He has quite long hind legs and a long tail, and\r\nthese show at once that he is a jumper.  In each cheek is a pocket\r\nopening from the outside, and these pockets are lined with hair.\r\nHe is called Silky Pocket Mouse because of the fineness and\r\nsoftness of his coat.  He has some larger cousins, one of them\r\nbeing a little bigger than Nibbler the House Mouse.  Neighbors\r\nand close relatives are the Spiny Pocket Mice."\r\n\r\n"Do they have spines like Prickly Porky?" demanded Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed.  "I don\'t wonder you ask," said she.\r\n"I think it is a foolish name myself, for they haven\'t any spines at\r\nall.  Their fur isn\'t as fine as that of Midget, and it has all\r\nthrough it long coarse hairs almost like bristles, and from these\r\nthey get their name.  The smallest of the Spiny Pocket Mice is\r\nabout the size of Nibbler the House Mouse and the largest is twice\r\nas big.  They are more slender than their Silky cousins, and their\r\ntails are longer in proportion to their size and have little tufts\r\nof hair at the ends.  Of course, they have pockets in their cheeks.\r\n\r\n"In habits all the Pocket Mice are much alike.  They make burrows\r\nin the ground, often throwing up a little mound with several\r\nentrances which lead to a central passageway connecting with the\r\nbedroom and storerooms.  By day the entrances are closed with\r\nearth from inside, for the Mice are active only at night.\r\nSometimes the burrows are hidden under bushes, and sometimes\r\nthey are right out in the open.  Living as they do in a hot, dry\r\ncountry, the Pocket Mice have learned to get along without\r\ndrinking water.  Their food consists mainly of a variety of\r\nsmall seeds.\r\n\r\n"Another Mouse of the West looks almost enough like Whitefoot to\r\nbe a member of his branch of the family.  He has a beautiful\r\nyellowish-brown coat and white waistcoat, and his feet are white.\r\nBut his tail is short in comparison with Whitefoot\'s and instead\r\nof being slim is quite thick.  His fur is like velvet.  He is\r\ncalled the Grasshopper Mouse."\r\n\r\n"Is that because he eats Grasshoppers?" asked Peter Rabbit at once.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve guessed it," laughed Old Mother Nature.  "He is very, very\r\nfond of Grasshoppers and Crickets.  He eats many kinds of insects,\r\nMoths, Flies, Cutworms, Beetles, Lizards, Frogs and Scorpions.\r\nBecause of his fondness for the latter he is called the Scorpion\r\nMouse in some sections.  He is fond of meat when he can get it.\r\nHe also eats seeds of many kinds.  He is found all over the West\r\nfrom well up in the North to the hot dry regions of the Southwest.\r\nWhen he cannot find a convenient deserted burrow of some other\r\nanimal, he digs a home for himself and there raises several families\r\neach year.  In the early evening he often utters a fine, shrill,\r\nwhistling call note.\r\n\r\n"Another little member of the Mouse family found clear across the\r\ncountry is the Harvest Mouse.  He is never bigger than Nibbler the\r\nHouse Mouse and often is much smaller.  In fact, he is one of the\r\nsmallest of the entire family.  In appearance he is much like\r\nNibbler, but his coat is browner and there are fine hairs on his\r\ntail.  He loves grassy, weedy or brushy places.\r\n\r\n"As a rule he does little harm to man, for his food is chiefly\r\nseeds of weeds, small wild fruits and parts of wild plants of no\r\nvalue to man.  Once in a while his family becomes so large that\r\nthey do some damage in grain fields.  But this does not happen\r\noften.  The most interesting thing about this little Mouse is the\r\nway he builds his home.  Sometimes he uses a hole in a tree or\r\npost and sometimes a deserted birds\' nest, but more frequently\r\nhe builds a nest for himself--a little round ball of grass and\r\nother vegetable matter.  This is placed in thick grass or weeds\r\nclose to the ground or in bushes or low trees several feet from\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n"They are well-built little houses and have one or more little\r\ndoorways on the under side when they are in bushes or trees.  Inside\r\nis a warm, soft bed made of milkweed or cattail down, the very\r\nnicest kind of a bed for the babies.  No one has a neater home than\r\nthe Harvest Mouse.  He is quite as much at home in bushes and low\r\ntrees as Happy Jack Squirrel is in bigger trees.  His long tail\r\ncomes in very handy then, for he often wraps it around a twig to\r\nmake his footing more secure.\r\n\r\n"Now this is all about the native Mice and--what is it, Peter?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve forgotten Nibbler the House Mouse," replied Peter.\r\n\r\n"How impatient some little folks are and how fearful that their\r\ncuriosity will not be satisfied," remarked Old Mother Nature.  "As\r\nI was saying, this is all about our native Mice; that is, the Mice\r\nwho belong to this country.  And now we come to Nibbler the House\r\nMouse, who, like Robber the Brown Rat, has no business here at all,\r\nbut who has followed man all over the world and like Robber has\r\nbecome a pest to man."\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit looked rather sheepish when he discovered that Old\r\nMother Nature hadn\'t for gotten, and resolved that in the future\r\nhe would hold his tongue.\r\n\r\n"Have any of you seen Nibbler?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"I have," replied Danny Meadow Mouse.  "Once I was carried to\r\nFarmer Brown\'s barn in a shock of corn and I found Nibbler living\r\nin the barn."\r\n\r\n"It is a wonder he wasn\'t living in Farmer Brown\'s house," said\r\nOld Mother Nature.  "Probably other members of his family were.\r\nHe is perfectly at home in any building put up by man, just as\r\nis Robber the Rat.  Because of his small size he can go where\r\nRobber cannot.  He delights to scamper about between the walls.\r\nBeing a true Rodent he is forever gnawing holes in the corners\r\nof rooms and opening on to pantry shelves so that he may steal\r\nfood.  He eats all sorts of food, but spoils more for man, by\r\nrunning about over it, than he eats.  In barns and henhouses he\r\ngets into the grain bins and steals a great deal of grain.\r\n\r\n"It is largely because of Robber the Rat and Nibbler that men keep\r\nthe Cats you all hate so.  A Cat is Nibbler\'s worst enemy.  Nibbler\r\nis slender and graceful, with a long, hairless tail and ears of\r\ngood size.  He is very timid, ready to dart into his hole at the\r\nleast sound.  He raises from four to nine babies at a time and\r\nseveral sets of them in a year.\r\n\r\n"If Mr. and Mrs. Nibbler are living in a house, their nest is made\r\nof scraps of paper, cloth, wool and other soft things stolen from\r\nthe people who live in the house.  In getting this material they\r\noften do great damage.  If they are living in a barn, they make\r\ntheir nest of hay and any soft material they can find.\r\n\r\n"While Nibbler prefers to live in or close to the homes of men,\r\nhe sometimes is driven out and then takes to the fields, especially\r\nin summer.  There he lives in all sorts of hiding places, and isn\'t\r\nat all particular what the place is, if it promises safety and food\r\ncan be obtained close by.  I\'m sorry Nibbler ever came to this\r\ncountry.  Man brought him here and now he is here to stay and quite\r\nas much at home as if he belonged here the way the rest of you do.\r\n\r\n"This finishes the lessons on the order of Rodents, the animals\r\nrelated by reason of having teeth for the purpose of gnawing.  I\r\nsuspect these are the only ones in whom you take any interest, and\r\nso you will not care to come to school any more.  Am I right?"\r\n\r\n"No, marm," answered Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, who, you remember,\r\nhad laughed at Peter Rabbit for wanting to go to school.  "No, marm.\r\nThere are ever so many other people of the Green Forest and the\r\nGreen Meadows we want to know more about than we now know.  Isn\'t\r\nthat so?"  Happy Jack turned to the others and every one nodded,\r\neven Prickly Porky.\r\n\r\n"There is one little fellow living right near here who looks to me\r\nas if he must be a member of the Mouse family, but he isn\'t like any\r\nof the Mice you have told us about," continued Happy Jack.  "He is\r\nso small he can hide under a leaf.  I\'m sure he must be a Mouse."\r\n\r\n"You mean Teeny Weeny the Shrew," replied Old Mother Nature, smiling\r\nat Happy Jack.  "He isn\'t a Mouse.  He isn\'t even a Rodent.  I\'ll\r\ntry to have him here to-morrow morning and we will see what we can\r\nfind out about him and his relatives."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX  Teeny Weeny and His Cousin\r\n\r\n"Of course Old Mother Nature knows, but just the same it is hard\r\nfor me not to believe that Teeny Weeny is a member of the Mouse\r\nfamily," said Happy Jack Squirrel to Peter Rabbit, as they\r\nscampered along to school.  "I never have had a real good look\r\nat him, but I\'ve had glimpses of him lots of times and always\r\nsupposed him a little Mouse with a short tail.  It is hard to\r\nbelieve that he isn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I hope Old Mother Nature will put him where we can get a good\r\nlook at him," replied Peter.  "Perhaps when you really see him he\r\nwon\'t look so much like a Mouse."\r\n\r\nWhen all had arrived Old Mother Nature began the morning lesson at\r\nonce.  "You have learned about all the families in the order of\r\nRodents," said she, "so now we will take up another and much smaller\r\norder called Insectivora.  I wonder if any of you can guess what\r\nthat means."\r\n\r\n"It sounds," said Peter Rabbit, "as if it must have something to do with\r\ninsects."\r\n\r\n"That is a very good guess, Peter," replied Old Mother Nature,\r\nsmiling at him.  "It does have to do with insects.  The members\r\nof this order live very largely on insects and worms, and the name\r\nInsectivora means insect-eating.  There are two families in this\r\norder, the Shrew family and the Mole family."\r\n\r\n"Then Teeny Weeny and Miner the Mole must be related," spoke\r\nPeter quickly.\r\n\r\n"Right again, Peter," was the prompt reply.  "The Shrews and the\r\nMoles are related in the same way that you and Happy Jack Squirrel\r\nare related."\r\n\r\n"And isn\'t Teeny Weeny the Shrew related to the Mice at all?"\r\nasked Happy Jack.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said Old Mother Nature.  "Many people think he is\r\nand often he is called Shrew Mouse.  But this is a great mistake.\r\nIt is the result of ignorance.  It seems strange to me that people\r\nso often know so little about their near neighbors."  She looked\r\nat Happy Jack Squirrel as she said this, and Happy Jack looked\r\nsheepish.  He felt just as he looked.  All this time the eyes of\r\nevery one had been searching this way, that way, every way, for\r\nTeeny Weeny, for Old Mother Nature had promised to try to have\r\nhim there that morning.  But Teeny Weeny was not to be seen.  Now\r\nand then a leaf on the ground close by Old Mother Nature\'s feet\r\nmoved, but the Merry Little Breezes were always stirring up\r\nfallen leaves, and no one paid any attention to these.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature understood the disappointment in the faces before\r\nher and her eyes began to twinkle.  "Yesterday I told you that I\r\nwould try to have Teeny Weeny here," said she.  A leaf moved.\r\nStooping quickly she picked it up.  "And here he is," she finished.\r\n\r\nSure enough where a second before the dead brown leaf had been was\r\na tiny little fellow, so tiny that that leaf had covered him\r\ncompletely, and it wasn\'t a very big leaf.  It was Teeny Weeny the\r\nShrew, also called the Common Shrew, the Long-tailed Shrew and the\r\nShrew Mouse, one of the smallest animals in all the Great World.\r\nHe started to dart under another leaf, but Old Mother Nature stopped\r\nhim.  "Sit still," she commanded sharply.  "You have nothing to fear.\r\nI want everybody to have a good look at you, for it is high time\r\nthese neighbors of yours should know you.  I know just how nervous\r\nand uncomfortable you are and I\'ll keep you only a few minutes.\r\nNow everybody take a good look at Teeny Weeny."\r\n\r\nThis command was quite needless, for all were staring with all\r\ntheir might.  What they saw was a mite of a fellow less than four\r\ninches long from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail, and\r\nof this total length the tail was almost half.  He was slender,\r\nhad short legs and mouselike feet.  His coat was brownish above\r\nand grayish beneath, and the fur was very fine and soft.\r\n\r\nBut the oddest thing about Teeny Weeny was his long, pointed head\r\nending in a long nose.  No Mouse has a head like it.  The edges of\r\nthe ears could be seen above the fur, but the eyes were so tiny\r\nthat Peter Rabbit thought he hadn\'t any and said so.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed.  "Yes, he has eyes, Peter," said she.\r\n"Look closely and you will see them.  But they don\'t amount to\r\nmuch--little more than to tell daylight from darkness.  Teeny\r\nWeeny depends on his nose chiefly.  He has a very wonderful little\r\nnose, flexible and very sensitive.  Of course, with such poor eyes\r\nhe prefers the dark when there are fewer enemies abroad."\r\n\r\nAll this time Teeny Weeny had been growing more and more uneasy.\r\nOld Mother Nature saw and understood.  Now she told him that he\r\nmight go.  Hardly were the words out of her mouth when he vanished,\r\ndarting under some dead leaves.  Hidden by them he made his way\r\nto an old log and was seen no more.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t he eat anything but insects and worms?" asked\r\nStriped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Old Mother Nature.  "He is very fond of flesh, and\r\nif he finds the body of a bird or animal that has been killed he\r\nwill tear it to pieces.  He is very hot-tempered, as are all his\r\nfamily, and will not hesitate to attack a Mouse much bigger than\r\nhimself.  He is so little and so active that he has to have a\r\ngreat deal of food and probably eats his own weight in food every\r\nday.  Of course, that means he must do a great deal of hunting,\r\nand he does.\r\n\r\n"He makes tiny little paths under the fallen leaves and in swampy\r\nplaces--little tunnels through the moss.  He is especially fond of\r\nold rotted stumps and logs and brush piles, for in such places he\r\ncan find grubs and insects.  At the same time he is well hidden.\r\nHe is active by day and night, but in the daytime takes pains to\r\nkeep out of the light.  He prefers damp to dry places.  In winter\r\nhe tunnels about under the snow.  In summer he uses the tunnels\r\nand runways of Meadow Mice and others when he can.  He eats seeds\r\nand other vegetable food when he cannot find insects or flesh."\r\n\r\n"How about his enemies?" asked Chatterer the Red Squirrel.\r\n\r\n"He has plenty," replied Old Mother Nature, "but is not so much\r\nhunted as the members of the Mouse family.  This is because he has\r\na strong, unpleasant scent which makes him a poor meal for those\r\nat all particular about their food.  Some of the Hawks and Owls\r\nappear not to mind this, and these are his worst enemies."\r\n\r\n"Has he any near relatives?" asked Jumper the Hare.\r\n\r\n"Several," was the prompt response.  "Blarina the Short-tailed\r\nShrew, also called Mole Shrew, is the best known.  He is found\r\neverywhere, in forests, old pastures and along grassy banks, but\r\nseldom far from water.  He prefers moist ground.  He is much\r\nlarger and thicker than Teeny Weeny and has a shorter tail.\r\nPeople often mistake him for Miner the Mole, because of the thick,\r\nfine fur which is much like Miner\'s and his habit of tunneling\r\nabout just beneath the surface, but if they would look at his\r\nfore feet they would never make that mistake.  They are small\r\nand like the feet of the Mouse family, not at all like Miner\'s\r\nbig shovels.  Moreover, he is smaller than Miner, and his tunnels\r\nare seldom in the earth but just under the leaves and grass.\r\n\r\n"His food is much the same as that of Teeny Weeny--worms, insects,\r\nflesh when he can get it, and seeds.  He is fond of beechnuts.  He\r\nis quite equal to killing a Mouse of his own size or bigger and\r\ndoes not hesitate to do so when he gets the chance.  He makes a\r\nsoft, comfortable nest under a log or in a stump or in the ground\r\nand has from four to six babies at a time.  Teeny Weeny sometimes\r\nhas as many as ten.  The senses of smell and hearing are very keen\r\nand make up for the lack of sight.  His eyes, like those of other\r\nShrews, are probably of use only in distinguishing light from\r\ndarkness.  His coat is dark brownish-gray.\r\n\r\n"Another of the Shrew family is the Marsh Shrew, also called Water\r\nShrew and Black-and white Shrew.  He is longer than either of the\r\nothers and, as you have guessed, is a lover of water.  He is a good\r\nswimmer and gets much of his food in the water--water Beetles and\r\ngrubs and perhaps Tadpoles and Minnows.  Now who among you knows\r\nMiner the Mole?"\r\n\r\n"I do.  That is, I have seen him," replied Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Very well, Peter, to-morrow morning we will see how much you know\r\nabout Miner," replied Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX  Four Busy Little Miners\r\n\r\nScampering along on his way to school and thinking of nothing so\r\nuninteresting as watching his steps, Peter Rabbit stubbed his toes.\r\nYes, sir, Peter stubbed his toes.  With a little exclamation of\r\nimpatience he turned to see what he had stumbled over.  It was a\r\nlittle ridge where the surface of the ground had been raised a\r\ntrifle since Peter had passed that way the day before.\r\n\r\nPeter chuckled.  "Now isn\'t that funny?" he demanded of no one at\r\nall, for he was quite alone.  Then he answered himself.  "It\r\ncertainly is," said he.  "Here I am on my way to learn something\r\nabout Miner the Mole, and I trip over one of the queer little\r\nridges he is forever making.  It wasn\'t here yesterday, so that\r\nmeans that he is at work right around here now.  Hello, I\r\nthought so!"\r\n\r\nPeter had been looking along that little ridge and had discovered\r\nthat it ended only a short distance from him.  Now as he looked at\r\nit again, he saw the flat surface of the ground at the end of the\r\nridge rise as if being pushed up from beneath, and that little\r\nridge became just so much longer.  Peter understood perfectly.  Out\r\nof sight beneath the surface Miner the Mole was at work.  He was\r\ndigging a tunnel, and that ridge was simply the roof to that\r\ntunnel.  It was so near the surface of the ground that Miner simply\r\npushed up the loose soil as he bored his way along, and this made\r\nthe little ridge over which Peter had stumbled.\r\n\r\nPeter watched a few minutes, then turned and scampered,\r\nlipperty-lipperty-lip, for the Green Forest.  He arrived at school quite\r\nout of breath, the last one.  Old Mother Nature was about to chide him\r\nfor being late, but noticing his excitement, she changed her mind.\r\n\r\n"Well, Peter," said she.  "What is it now?  Did you have a narrow\r\nescape on your way here?"\r\n\r\nPeter shook his head.  "No," he replied.  "No, I didn\'t have a\r\nnarrow escape, but I discovered something."\r\n\r\nHappy Jack Squirrel snickered.  "Peter is always discovering\r\nsomething," said he.  "He is a great little discoverer.  Probably\r\nhe has just found out that the only way to get anywhere on time\r\nis to start soon enough."\r\n\r\n"No such thing!" declared Peter indignantly.  "You--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind him, Peter," interrupted Old Mother Nature soothingly.\r\n"What was it you discovered?"\r\n\r\n"That the very one we are to learn about is only a little way from\r\nhere this very minute.  Miner the Mole is at work on the Green\r\nMeadow; close to the edge of the Green Forest," cried Peter eagerly.\r\n"I thought perhaps you would want to-"\r\n\r\n"Have this morning\'s lesson right there where we can at least see\r\nhis works if not himself," interrupted Old Mother Nature again.\r\n"That is fine, Peter.  We will go over there at once.  It is always\r\nbetter to see things than to merely hear about them."\r\n\r\nSo Peter led the way to where he had stumbled over that little\r\nridge on his way to school.  It was longer than when he had left\r\nit, but even as the others crowded about to look, the earth was\r\npushed up and it grew in length.  Old Mother Nature stooped and\r\nmade a little hole in that ridge.  Then she put her lips close to\r\nit and commanded Miner to come out.  She spoke softly, pleasantly,\r\nbut in a way that left no doubt that she expected to be obeyed.\r\n\r\nShe was.  Almost at once a queer, long, sharp nose was poked out\r\nof the little hole she had made, and a squeaky voice asked\r\nfretfully, "Do I have to come way out?"\r\n\r\n"You certainly do," replied Old Mother Nature.  "I want some of\r\nyour friends and neighbors to get a good look at you, and they\r\ncertainly can\'t do that with only that sharp nose of yours to be\r\nseen.  Now scramble out here.  No one will hurt you.  I will keep\r\nyou only a few minutes.  Then you can go back to your everlasting\r\ndigging.  Out with you, now!"\r\n\r\nWhile the others gathered in a little circle close about that hole\r\nthere scrambled into view one of the queerest little fellows in all\r\nthe Great World.  Few of them had ever seen him close to before.\r\nHe was a stout little fellow with the softest, thickest, gray coat\r\nimaginable.  He was about six inches long and had a funny, short,\r\npinkish-white, naked tail that at once reminded Peter of an Angleworm.\r\n\r\nHis head seemed to be set directly on his shoulders, so that\r\nthere was no neck worth mentioning.  His nose was long and sharp\r\nand extended far beyond his mouth.  Neither ears nor eyes were\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nStriped Chipmunk at once wanted to know how Miner could see.  "He\r\ndoesn\'t see as you do," replied Old Mother Nature.  "He has very\r\nsmall eyes, tiny things, which you might find if you should part\r\nthe fur around them, but they are of use only to distinguish light\r\nfrom darkness.  Miner hasn\'t the least idea what any of you look\r\nlike.  You see, he spends his life under ground and of course has\r\nno use for eyes there.  They would be a nuisance, for the dirt would\r\nbe continually getting in them if they were any larger than they\r\nare or were not protected as they are.  If you should feel of\r\nMiner\'s nose you would find it hard.  That is because he uses it\r\nto bore with in the earth.  Just notice those hands of his."\r\n\r\nAt once everybody looked at Miner\'s hands.  No one ever had seen\r\nsuch hands before.  The arms were short but looked very strong.\r\nThe hands also were rather short, but what they lacked in length\r\nthey made up in width and they were armed with long, stout claws.\r\nBut the queer thing about them was the way he held them.  He held\r\nthem turned out.  His hind feet were not much different from the\r\nhind feet of the Mouse family.\r\n\r\nMiner was plainly uncomfortable.  He wriggled about uneasily and\r\nit was very clear that he was there only because Old Mother Nature\r\nhad commanded him to be there, and that the one thing he wanted\r\nmost was to get back into his beloved ground.  Old Mother Nature\r\nsaw this and took pity on him.  She picked him up and placed him\r\non the ground where there was no opening near.\r\n\r\n"Now, Miner," said she, "your friends and neighbors have had a\r\ngood look at you, and I know just how uncomfortable you feel.\r\nThere is but one thing more I\'ll ask of you.  It is that you will\r\nshow us how you can dig.  Johnny Chuck thinks he is a pretty good\r\ndigger.  Just show him what you can do in that line."\r\n\r\nMiner didn\'t wait to be told twice.  The instant Old Mother Nature\r\nstopped speaking he began to push and bore into the earth with\r\nhis sharp nose.  One of those great, spadelike hands was slipped\r\nup past his face and the claws driven in beside his nose.  Then it\r\nwas swept back and the loosened earth with it.  The other hand was\r\nused in the same way.  It was quite plain to everybody why they\r\nwere turned out in the way they were.  There was nothing slow about\r\nthe way Miner used that boring nose and those shoveling hands.\r\nPeter Rabbit had hardly time for half a dozen long breaths before\r\nMiner the Mole had disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Some digging!" exclaimed Peter.\r\n\r\n"Never again as long as I live will I boast of my digging," declared\r\nJohnny Chuck admiringly.  From the point where Miner had entered\r\nthe ground a little ridge was being pushed up, and they watched it\r\ngrow surprisingly fast as the little worker under the sod pushed\r\nhis tunnel along in the direction of his old tunnels.  It was clear\r\nthat he was in a hurry to get back where he could work in peace.\r\n\r\n"What a queer life," exclaimed Happy Jack Squirrel.  "He can\'t\r\nhave much fun.  I should think it would be awful living in the\r\ndark that way all the time."\r\n\r\n"You forget that he cannot see as you can, and so prefers the\r\ndark," replied Old Mother Nature.  "As for fun, he gets that in\r\nhis work.  He is called Miner because he lives in the ground and\r\nis always tunneling."\r\n\r\n"What does he eat, the roots of plants?" asked Jumper the Hare.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature shook her head.  "A lot of people think that,"\r\nsaid she, "and often Miner is charged with destroying growing\r\ncrops, eating seed corn, etc.  That is because his tunnels are\r\nfound running along the rows of plants.  The fact is Miner has\r\nsimply been hunting for grubs and worms around the roots of\r\nthose plants.  He hasn\'t touched the plants at all.  I suspect\r\nthat Danny Meadow Mouse or one of his cousins could explain who\r\nate the seed corn and the young plants.  They are rather fond of\r\nusing Miner\'s tunnels when he isn\'t about."\r\n\r\nDanny hung his head and looked guilty, but didn\'t say anything.\r\n"The only harm Miner does is sometimes to tunnel so close to\r\ngarden plants that he lets air in around the tender roots and they\r\ndry out," continued Old Mother Nature.  "His food consists almost\r\nwholly of worms, grubs and insects, and he has to have a great many\r\nto keep him alive.  That is why he is so active.  Those tunnels of\r\nhis which seem to be without any plan are made in his search for\r\nfood.  He is especially fond of Angleworms.\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact, he is a useful little fellow.  The only\r\ntime he becomes a nuisance to man is when he makes his little\r\nridges across smooth lawns.  Even then he pays for the trouble by\r\ndestroying the grubs in the grass roots, grubs that in their turn\r\nwould destroy the grass.  When you see his ridges you may know that\r\nhis food is close to the surface.  When in dry or cold weather the\r\nworms go deep in the ground, Miner follows and then there is no\r\ntrace of his tunnels on the surface.\r\n\r\n"Night and day are all the same to him.  He works and sleeps when\r\nhe chooses.  In winter he tunnels below the frost line.  You all\r\nnoticed how dense his fur is.  That is so the sand cannot work\r\ndown in it.  His home is a snug nest of grass or leaves in a\r\nlittle chamber under the ground in which several tunnels offer\r\neasy means of escape in case of sudden danger."\r\n\r\n"Has Miner any near relatives?" asked Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Several," replied Old Mother Nature.  "All are much alike in\r\nhabits.  One who lives a little farther north is called Brewer\'s\r\nMole or the Hairytailed Mole.  His tail is a little longer than\r\nMiner\'s and is covered with fine hair.  The largest and handsomest\r\nmember of the family is the Oregon Mole of the Northwest.  His\r\ncoat is very dark and his fur extremely fine.  His ways are much\r\nthe same as those of Miner whom you have just met, excepting that\r\nwhen he is tunneling deep in the ground he pushes the earth to the\r\nsurface after the manner of Grubby Gopher, and his mounds become\r\na nuisance to farmers.  When he is tunneling just under the surface\r\nhe makes ridges exactly like these of his eastern cousin.\r\n\r\n"But the oddest member of the Mole family is the Star-nosed Mole.\r\nHe looks much like Miner with the exception of his nose and tail.\r\nHis nose has a fringe of little fleshy points, twenty-two of them,\r\nlike a many-pointed star.  From this he gets his name.  His tail\r\nis a little longer than Miner\'s and is hairy.  During the late\r\nfall and winter this becomes much enlarged.\r\n\r\n"This funny little fellow with the star-like nose is especially\r\nfond of moist places, swamps, damp meadows, and the banks of\r\nstreams.  He is not at all afraid of the water and is a good\r\nswimmer.  Sometimes he may be seen swimming under the ice in\r\nwinter.  He is seldom found where the earth is dry.  For that\r\nmatter, none of the family are found in those sections where\r\nthere are long, dry periods and the earth becomes baked and hard.\r\n\r\n"The fur of Miner and his cousins will lay in either direction,\r\nwhich keeps it smooth no matter whether the wearer is going\r\nforward or backward.  Otherwise it would be badly mussed up most\r\nof the time.  Altogether these little underground workers are\r\nmost interesting little people when you know them.  But that\r\nis something few people have a chance to do.\r\n\r\n"Now just remember that the Shrews and the Moles belong to the\r\norder of Insectivora, meaning eaters of insects, and are the only\r\ntwo families in that order.  And don\'t despise either of them, for\r\nthey do a great deal of good in the Great World, more than some\r\nright here whom I might name, but will not.  School is dismissed."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI  Flitter the Bat and His Family\r\n\r\nIn the dusk of early evening, as Peter Rabbit sat trying to make\r\nup his mind whether to spend that night at home in the dear Old\r\nBriar-patch with timid little Mrs. Peter or go over to the Green\r\nForest in search of adventure, a very fine, squeaky voice which\r\ncame right out of the air above him startled him for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Better stay at home, Peter Rabbit.  Better stay at home to-night,"\r\nsaid the thin, squeaky voice.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Flitter!" exclaimed Peter, as he stared up at a little\r\ndark form darting this way, twisting that way, now up, now down,\r\nalmost brushing Peter\'s head and then flying so high he could\r\nhardly be seen.  "Why should I stay at home?"\r\n\r\n"Because I saw Old Man Coyote sneaking along the edge of the Green\r\nForest, Reddy Fox is hunting on the Green Meadows, and Hooty the\r\nOwl is on watch in the Old Orchard," replied Flitter the Red Bat.\r\n"Of course it is no business of mine what you do, Peter Rabbit, but\r\nwere I in your place I certainly would stay at home.  Gracious!\r\nI\'m glad I can go where I please when I please.  You ought to fly,\r\nPeter.  You ought to fly.  There is nothing like it."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could," sighed Peter.\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t say I didn\'t warn you," squeaked Flitter, and darted\r\naway in the direction of Farmer Brown\'s house.  Peter wisely\r\ndecided that the dear Old Briar-patch was the best place for him\r\nthat night, so he remained at home, to the joy of timid little\r\nMrs. Peter, and spent the night eating, dozing and wondering how\r\nit would seem to be able to fly like Flitter the Bat.\r\n\r\nFlitter was still in his mind when he started for school the next\r\nmorning, and by the time he got there he was bubbling over with\r\ncuriosity and questions.  He could hardly wait for school to be\r\ncalled to order.  Old Mother Nature noticed how fidgety he was.\r\n\r\n"What have you on your mind, Peter?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you tell us that the Shrew family and the Mole family are\r\nthe only families in this country in the order of insect-eaters?"\r\nasked Peter.\r\n\r\n"I certainly did," was the prompt reply.  "Doesn\'t Flitter the Bat\r\nlive on insects?" asked Peter.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature nodded.  "He does," said she.  "In fact he lives\r\naltogether on insects."\r\n\r\n"Then why isn\'t he a member of that order?" demanded Peter.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled, for she was pleased that Peter had thought\r\nof this.  "That question does you credit, Peter," said she.  "The\r\nreason is that he and his relatives are so very different from other\r\nanimals that they have been placed in an order of their own.  It is\r\ncalled the Chi-rop-ter-a, which means wing-handed.  How many of you\r\nknow Flitter the Bat?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve often seen him," declared Jumper the Hare.\r\n\r\n"So have I," said Chatterer the Red Squirrel.  Each of the others\r\nsaid the same thing.  There wasn\'t one who hadn\'t watched and\r\nenvied Flitter darting about in the air just at dusk of early\r\nevening or as the Black Shadows were stealing away in the early\r\nmorning.  Old Mother Nature smiled.\r\n\r\n"Seeing him isn\'t knowing him," said she.  "Who is there who knows\r\nanything about him and his ways save that he flies at night and\r\ncatches insects in the air?"\r\n\r\nShe waited a minute or two, but no one spoke.  The fact is there\r\nwas not one who really knew anything about Flitter.  "It is one of\r\nthe strange things of life," said she, "that people often know\r\nnothing about the neighbors whom they see every day.  But in this\r\ncase it is not to be wondered at.  I suspect none of you has seen\r\nFlitter, excepting in the air, and then he moves so rapidly that\r\nthere is no chance to get a good look at him.  I think this is\r\njust the time and place for you to really make the acquaintance\r\nof Flitter the Red Bat."\r\n\r\nShe stepped over to a bush and parted the leaves.  Hanging from\r\na twig was what appeared at first glance to be a rumpled,\r\nreddish-brown dead leaf.  She touched it lightly.  At once it came to\r\nlife, stirring uneasily.  A thin, squeaky voice peevishly demanded to\r\nknow what was wanted.\r\n\r\n"You have some callers, a few of your friends who want to get\r\nreally acquainted with you.  Suppose you wake up for a few minutes,"\r\nexplained Old Mother Nature pleasantly.\r\n\r\nFlitter, for that is just who it was, yawned once or twice sleepily,\r\nshook himself, then grinned down at the wondering faces of his\r\nfriends crowded about just under him.  "Hello, folks," said he in\r\nthat thin, squeaky voice of his.\r\n\r\nThe sunlight fell full on him, but he seemed not to mind it in the\r\nleast.  In fact, he appeared to enjoy its warmth.  He was hanging\r\nby his toes, head down, his wings folded.  He was about four inches\r\nlong, and his body was much like that of a Mouse.  His fur was\r\nfine and thick, a beautiful orange-red.  For his size his ears were\r\nlarge.  Instead of the long head and sharp nose of the Mouse family,\r\nFlitter had a rather round head and blunt nose.  Almost at once Peter\r\nRabbit made a discovery.  It was that Flitter possessed a pair of\r\nbright, little, snapping eyes and didn\'t seem in the least bothered\r\nby the bright light.\r\n\r\n"Where did that saying \'blind as a Bat\' ever come from?"\r\ndemanded Peter.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed.  "Goodness knows; I don\'t," said she.\r\n"There is nothing blind about Flitter.  He sleeps through the\r\nday and does his hunting in the dusk of evening or early morning,\r\nbut if he is disturbed and has to fly during the day, he has no\r\ntrouble in seeing.  Flitter, stretch out one of your wings so\r\nthat everybody can see it."\r\n\r\nObediently Flitter stretched out one of his wings.  Everybody\r\ngasped, for it was the first time any of them ever had seen one\r\nof those wings near enough to know just what it was like.\r\nFlitter\'s arm was long, especially from his elbow to his hand.\r\nBut the surprising thing was the length of his three fingers.\r\nEach finger appeared to be about as long as the whole arm.  From\r\nhis shoulder a thin, rubbery skin was stretched to the ends of\r\nthe long fingers, then across to the ankle of his hind foot on\r\nthat side, and from there across to the tip of his tail.  A\r\nlittle short thumb with a long, curved claw stuck up free from\r\nthe edge of the wing.\r\n\r\n"Now you can see just why he is called winghanded," explained Old\r\nMother Nature, as Flitter folded the wing.  In a minute he began\r\nto clean it.  Everybody laughed, for it was funny to watch him.\r\nHe would take the skin of the wing in his mouth and pull and stretch\r\nit as if it were rubber.  He washed it with his tiny tongue.  Then\r\nhe washed his fur.  You see, Flitter is very neat.  With the little\r\nclaw of his thumb he scratched his head and combed his hair.  All\r\nthe time he remained hanging head down, clinging to the twig with\r\nhis toes.\r\n\r\n"Where is Mrs. Flitter?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know," replied Flitter, beginning on the other wing.  "She\'s\r\nquite equal to looking after herself, so I don\'t worry about her."\r\n\r\n"Nor about your babies.  Flitter, I\'m ashamed of you.  You are a\r\npoor kind of father," declared Old Mother Nature severely.  "If\r\nyou don\'t know where to find your family, I\'ll show you."\r\n\r\nShe stepped over to the very next tree, parted the leaves, and\r\nthere, sure enough, hung Mrs. Flitter fast asleep.  And clinging\r\nto her were three of the funniest babies in all the Great World!\r\nAll were asleep, and Old Mother Nature didn\'t awaken them.  As for\r\nFlitter, he seemed to take not the slightest interest in his\r\nfamily, but went right on with his toilet.\r\n\r\n"Flitter the Red Bat is one of the best known of the whole family\r\nin this country," said Old Mother Nature, as they left Flitter to\r\nresume his nap.  He is found from the East to the Far West, from\r\nocean to ocean.  Like the birds, he migrates when cold weather\r\ncomes, returning in the early summer.  Although, like all Bats,\r\nhe sleeps all day as a rule, he doesn\'t mind the sunlight, as you\r\nhave just seen for yourselves.  Sometimes on dull, dark days he\r\ndoesn\'t wait for evening, but flies in the afternoon.  Usually he\r\nis the first of the Bat family to appear in the evening, often coming\r\nout while it is still light enough to show the color of his red coat.\r\nNo other member of his family has a coat of this color.\r\n\r\n"Some people call him the Tree Bat.  After seeing him hanging over\r\nthere I think you can guess why.  He rarely goes to a cave for his\r\ndaytime sleep, as most of his relatives do, but hangs by his toes\r\nfrom a twig of a tree or bush, frequently not far from the ground,\r\njust as he is right now.\r\n\r\n"As all of you who have watched him know, Flitter is a swift flier.\r\nThis is because his wings are long and narrow.  They are made for\r\nspeed.  I want you to know that the Bats are among the most\r\nwonderful of all my little people.  Few if any birds can equal them\r\nin the air because of their wonderful ability to twist and turn.\r\nThey are masters of the art of flying.  Moreover, they make no\r\nsound with their wings, something which only the Owls among birds\r\ncan boast of.\r\n\r\n"You all saw the three babies clinging to Mrs. Flitter.  Most Bats\r\nhave but two babies at a time, occasionally only one, but the Red\r\nBat and his larger cousin, the Hoary Bat, have three or four.  Mrs.\r\nFlitter carries her babies about with her until they are quite big.\r\nWhen they are too large to be carried she leaves them hanging in a\r\ntree while she hunts for her meals.\r\n\r\n"Flitter has many cousins.  One of these is the Little Brown Bat,\r\none of the smallest members of the family and found all over the\r\ncountry.  He is brown all over.  He is sometimes called the Cave\r\nBat, because whenever a cave is to be found he sleeps there.\r\nSometimes great numbers of these little Bats are found crowded\r\ntogether in a big cave.  When there is no cave handy, a barn or\r\nhollow tree is used.  Often he will creep behind the closed\r\nblinds of a house to spend the day.\r\n\r\n"Very like this little fellow in color is his cousin the Big Brown\r\nBat, called the House Bat and the Carolina Bat.  He is especially\r\nfond of the homes of men.  He is a little bigger than the Red Bat.\r\nWhile the latter is one of the first Bats to appear in the evening,\r\nthe former is one of the last, coming out only when it is quite\r\ndark.  He also found all over the country.\r\n\r\n"The Silvery Bat is of nearly the same size and in many places is\r\nmore common than any its cousins.  The fur is dark brown or black\r\nwith white tips, especially in the young.  From this it gets its\r\nname.  One of the largest and handsomest of the Bat cousins, and\r\none of the rarest is the Hoary Bat.  His fur is a mixture of dark\r\nand light brown tipped with white.  He is very handsome.  His\r\nwings are very long and narrow and he is one of the most wonderful\r\nof all fliers.  He is a lover of the Green Forest and does his\r\nhunting high above the tree-tops, making his appearance late in\r\nthe evening.  Like the Red Bat he spends the hours of daylight\r\nhanging in a tree.\r\n\r\n"Down in the Southeast is a member of the family with ears so big\r\nthat he is called the Big-eared Bat.  He is a little chap, smaller\r\nthan Little Brown Bat, and his ears are half as long his head and\r\nbody together.  What do you think of that?  For his size he has\r\nthe biggest ears of any animal in all this great country.  A\r\nrelative in the Southwest is the Big-eared Bat.\r\n\r\n"All members of the Bat family are drinkers and usually the first\r\nthing they do when they start out at dusk is to seek water.  All\r\nlive wholly on insects, and for this reason they are among the very\r\nbest friends of man.  They eat great numbers of Mosquitoes.  They do\r\nno harm whatever, which is more than can be said for some of the\r\nrest of you little folks.  Now who shall we learn about next?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII  An Independent Family\r\n\r\nJust as Old Mother Nature asked who they should learn about next,\r\nHappy Jack Squirrel spied some one coming down the Lone Little\r\nPath.  "See who\'s coming!" cried Happy Jack.\r\n\r\nEverybody turned to look down the Lone Little Path.  There, ambling\r\nalong in the most matter-of-fact and unconcerned way imaginable, came\r\na certain small person who was dressed wholly in black and white.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Jimmy Skunk," cried Chatterer the Red Squirrel.  "What are\r\nyou doing over here in the Green Forest?"  Jimmy Skunk looked up\r\nand grinned.  It was a slow, good-natured grin.  "Hello, everybody,"\r\nsaid he. "I thought I would just amble over here and see your school.\r\nI suppose all you fellows are getting so wise that pretty soon you\r\nwill think you know all there is to know.  Have any of you seen any\r\nfat Beetles around here?"\r\n\r\nJust then Jimmy noticed Old Mother Nature and hastened to bow his\r\nhead in a funny way.  "Please excuse me, Mother Nature," he said,\r\n"I thought school was over.  I don\'t want to interrupt."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled.  The fact is, Old Mother Nature is rather\r\nfond of Jimmy Skunk.  "You aren\'t interrupting," said she.  "The\r\nfact is, we had just ended the lesson about Flitter the Bat and\r\nhis relatives, and were trying to decide who to study about next.\r\nI think you came along at just the right time.  You belong to a\r\nlarge and rather important order, one that all these little folks\r\nhere ought to know about.  How many cousins have you, Jimmy?"\r\n\r\nJimmy Skunk looked a little surprised at the question.  He scratched\r\nhis head thoughtfully.  "Let me see," said he, "I have several close\r\ncousins in the Skunk branch of the family, but I presume you want to\r\nknow who my cousins are outside of the Skunk branch.  They are\r\nShadow the Weasel, Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter.  These are the\r\nonly ones I can think of now."\r\n\r\n"How about Digger the Badger?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nA look of surprise swept over Jimmy Skunk\'s face.  "Digger the\r\nBadger!" he exclaimed.  "Digger the Badger is no cousin of mine!"\r\n\r\n"Tut, tut, tut!" chided Old Mother Nature.  "Tut, tut, tut, Jimmy\r\nSkunk!  It is high time you came to school.  Digger the Badger is\r\njust as much a cousin of yours as is Shadow the Weasel.  You are\r\nmembers of the same order and it is a rather large order.  It is\r\ncalled the Car-niv-o-ra, which means \'flesh-eating.\'  You are a\r\nmember of the Marten or Weasel family, and that family is called\r\nthe \'Mus-tel-i-dae.\'  Digger the Badger is also a member of that\r\nfamily.  That means that you two are cousins.  You and Digger and\r\nGlutton the Wolverine belong to the stout-bodied branch of the\r\nfamily.  Billy Mink, Little Joe Otter, Shadow the Weasel, Pekan\r\nthe Fisher and Spite the Marten belong to its slim-bodied branch.\r\nBut all are members of the same family despite the difference in\r\nlooks, and thus, of course, are cousins.  Seeing that you are here,\r\nJimmy, I think we will find out just how much these little folks\r\nknow about you.\r\n\r\n"Peter Rabbit, tell us what you know about Jimmy Skunk."\r\n\r\n"I know one thing about him," declared Peter, "and that\'s that he is\r\nthe most independent fellow in the world.  He isn\'t afraid of anybody.\r\nI saw Buster Bear actually step out of his way the other day."\r\n\r\nJimmy Skunk grinned.  "Buster always treats me very politely,"\r\nsaid Jimmy.\r\n\r\n"I have noticed that everybody does, even Farmer Brown\'s boy," spoke\r\nup Happy Jack Squirrel.\r\n\r\n"It is easy enough to be independent when everybody is afraid of\r\nyou," sputtered Chatterer the Red Squirrel.\r\n\r\n"Just why is everybody afraid of Jimmy Skunk," asked Old\r\nMother Nature.\r\n\r\n"They are afraid of that little scent gun he carries," spoke up Peter\r\nRabbit. "I wish I had one just like it."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature shook her head.  "It wouldn\'t do, Peter, to trust\r\nyou with a gun like Jimmy Skunk\'s," said she.  "You are altogether\r\ntoo heedless and careless.  If you had a scent gun like Jimmy\'s, I\r\nam afraid there would be trouble in the Green Forest and on the Green\r\nMeadow all the time.  I suspect that you would drive everybody else\r\naway.  Jimmy is never heedless or careless.  He never uses that little\r\nscent gun unless he is in real danger or thinks he is.  Usually he\r\nis pretty sure that he is before he uses it.  I\'ll venture to say\r\nthat not one of you has seen Jimmy use that little scent gun."\r\n\r\nPeter looked at Jumper the Hare.  Jumper looked at Chatterer.  Chatterer\r\nlooked at Happy Jack.  Happy Jack looked at Danny Meadow Mouse.  Danny\r\nlooked at Striped Chipmunk.  Striped looked at Johnny Chuck.  Johnny\r\nlooked at Whitefoot the Wood Mouse.  Then all looked at Old Mother\r\nNature and shook their heads.  "I thought as much," said she.  "Jimmy\r\nis wonderfully well armed, but for defense only.  He never makes the\r\nmistake of misusing that little scent gun.  But everybody knows he\r\nhas it, so nobody interferes with him.  Now, Peter, what more do you\r\nknow about Jimmy?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s lazy," replied Peter.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not lazy," retorted Jimmy Skunk.  "I\'m no more lazy than you\r\nare.  You call me lazy just because I don\'t hurry.  I don\'t have\r\nto hurry, and I never can see any good in hurrying when one\r\ndoesn\'t have to."\r\n\r\n"That will do," interposed Old Mother Nature.  "Go on, Peter, with\r\nwhat you know about Jimmy."  "He is good-natured," said Peter, and\r\ngrinned at Jimmy.\r\n\r\nJimmy grinned back.  "Thank you, Peter," said he.\r\n\r\n"He is one of the best-natured people I know," continued Peter.  "I\r\nguess it is a lucky thing for the rest of us that he is.  I have\r\nnoticed that fat people are usually good-natured, and Jimmy is nearly\r\nalways fat.  In fact, I don\'t think I have seen him what you would\r\ncall really thin excepting very early in the spring.  He eats Beetles\r\nand grubs and Grasshoppers and Crickets and insects of all sorts.  I\r\nam told that he steals eggs when he can find them."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and he catches members of my family when he can," spoke up Danny\r\nMeadow Mouse.  "I never feel safe with Jimmy Skunk very near."\r\n\r\nJimmy didn\'t look at all put out.  "I might as well confess that\r\ntender Mouse is rather to my liking," said he, "and I might add that\r\nI also enjoy a Frog now and then, or a Lizard or a fish."\r\n\r\n"Also you might mention that young birds don\'t come amiss when you\r\ncan get them," spoke up Chatterer the Red Squirrel maliciously.\r\n\r\nJimmy looked up at Chatterer.  "That\'s a case of the pot calling\r\nthe kettle black," said he and Chatterer made a face at him.  But\r\nChatterer said nothing more, for he knew that all the others knew\r\nthat what Jimmy said was true: Chatterer had robbed many a nest\r\nof young birds.\r\n\r\n"Is that all you know about Jimmy?" asked Old Mother Nature of Peter.\r\n\r\n"I guess it is," replied Peter, "excepting that he lives in a hole\r\nin the ground, and I seldom see him out in winter.  I rather think\r\nhe sleeps all winter, the same as Johnny Chuck does."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got another think coming, Peter," said Jimmy.  "I sleep a\r\nlot during the winter, but I don\'t go into winter quarters until\r\nwell after snow comes, and I don\'t sleep the way Johnny Chuck does.\r\nSometimes I go out in winter and hunt around a little."\r\n\r\n"Do you dig your house?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nJimmy shook his head.  "Not when I can help myself," said he, "It\r\nis too much work.  If I have to I do, but I would much rather use\r\none of Johnny Chuck\'s old houses.  His houses suit me first rate."\r\n\r\n"I want you all to look at Jimmy very closely," said Old Mother\r\nNature.  "You will notice that he is about the size of Black\r\nPussy, the Cat from Farmer Brown\'s, and that his coat is black\r\nwith broad white stripes.  But not all Skunks are marked alike.  I\r\ndare say that no two of Jimmy\'s children would be exactly alike.\r\nI suspect that one or more might be all black, with perhaps a\r\nlittle bit of white on the tail.  Notice that Jimmy\'s front feet\r\nhave long, sharp claws.  He uses these to dig out grubs and\r\ninsects in the ground, and for pulling over sticks and stones in\r\nhis search for beetles.  Also notice that he places his feet on\r\nthe ground very much as does Buster Bear.  That big, bushy tail\r\nof his is for the purpose of warning folks.  Jimmy never shoots\r\nthat little scent gun without first giving warning.  When that\r\ntail of his begins to go up in the air, wise people watch out.\r\n\r\n"A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that Jimmy Skunk and\r\nhis family do a great deal of harm.  The truth is, they do a great\r\ndeal of good to man.  Once in a while they will make the mistake\r\nof stealing Chickens or eggs, but it is only once in a while.  They\r\nmake up for all they take in this way by the pests they destroy.\r\nJimmy and Mrs. Skunk have a large family each year, usually from\r\nsix to ten.  Mrs. Skunk usually is living by herself when the babies\r\nare born, but when they are big enough to walk their father rejoins\r\nthe family, and you may see them almost any pleasant evening\r\nstarting out together to hunt for Grasshoppers, Beetles and other\r\nthings.  Often the whole family remains together the whole winter,\r\nnot breaking up until spring.  Jimmy is one of the neatest of all\r\nmy little people and takes the best of care of his handsome coat.\r\nHe isn\'t afraid of water and can swim if it is necessary.  He does\r\nmost of his hunting at night, sleeping during the day.  He is one\r\nof the few little wild people who haven\'t been driven away by man,\r\nand often makes his home close to man\'s home.\r\n\r\n"Jimmy has own cousins in nearly all parts of this great country.\r\nWay down in the Southwest is one called the Hog-nosed Skunk, one of\r\nthe largest of the family.  He gets his name because of the shape\r\nof his nose and the fact that he roots in the ground the same as\r\na hog.  He is also called the Badger Skunk because of the big claws\r\non his front feet and the fact that he is a great digger.  His fur\r\nis not so fine as that of Jimmy Skunk, but is rather coarse and\r\nharsh.  He is even more of an insect eater than is Jimmy.\r\n\r\n"The smallest of Jimmy\'s own cousins is the Little Spotted Skunk.\r\nHe is only about half as big as Jimmy, and his coat, instead of\r\nbeing striped with white like Jimmy\'s, is covered with irregular\r\nwhite lines and spots, making it appear very handsome.  He lives\r\nin the southern half of the country and in habits is much like\r\nJimmy, but he is much livelier.  Occasionally he climbs low trees.\r\nLike Jimmy he eats almost anything he can find.  And it goes\r\nwithout saying that, like Jimmy, he carries a little scent gun.\r\nBy the way, Jimmy, what do you do when you are angry?  Show us."\r\n\r\nJimmy began to growl, a queer-sounding little growl, and at the\r\nsame time to stamp the ground with his front feet.  Old Mother\r\nNature laughed.  "When you see Jimmy do that," said she, "it is\r\nbest to pretend you don\'t see him and keep out of his way."\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t Jimmy any enemies at all?" asked Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"That depends on how hungry some folks get," replied Old Mother\r\nNature.  "Hooty the Owl doesn\'t seem to mind Jimmy\'s little scent\r\ngun, but this is the only one I can think of who doesn\'t.  Some of\r\nthe bigger animals might take him if they were starving, but even\r\nthen I think they would think twice.  Who knows where Digger the\r\nBadger is living?"\r\n\r\n"I do," replied Peter Rabbit.  "He is living out on the Green\r\nMeadows over near the Old Pasture."\r\n\r\n"All right, Peter," replied Old Mother Nature, "suppose you run\r\nover and pay him a visit and to-morrow morning you can tell us\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII  Digger and His Cousin Glutton\r\n\r\n"Well, Peter," said Old Mother Nature, "did you visit Digger the\r\nBadger yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m," replied Peter, "I visited him, but I didn\'t find out much.\r\nHe\'s a regular old grouch.  He isn\'t the least bit neighborly.  It\r\ntook me a long time to find him.  He has more holes than anybody I\r\never knew, and I couldn\'t tell which one is his home.  When I did\r\nfind him, he gave me a terrible scare.  I didn\'t see him until I\r\nwas right on top of him, and if I hadn\'t jumped, and jumped quickly,\r\nI guess I wouldn\'t be here this morning.  He was lying flat down in\r\nthe grass and he was so very flat that I just didn\'t see him.  When\r\nI told him that I wanted to know all about him and his ways, he\r\nreplied that it was none of my business how he lived or what he did,\r\nand that was all I could get out of him.\r\n\r\n"I sat around awhile and watched him, but he didn\'t do much except\r\ntake a sun bath.  He certainly is a queer-looking fellow to be a\r\nmember of the Weasel family.  There\'s nothing about him that looks\r\nlike a Weasel, that I could see.  Of course, he isn\'t as broad as\r\nhe is long, but he looks almost that when he is lying flat down and\r\nthat long hair of his is spread out on both sides.  He really has a\r\nhandsome coat when you come to look at it.  It is silvery gray and\r\nsilky looking.  It seems to be parted right down the middle of his\r\nback.  His tail is rather short, but stout and hairy.  His head and\r\nface are really handsome.  His cheeks, chin and a broad stripe from\r\nhis nose right straight back over his head are white.  On each cheek\r\nis a bar of black.  The back part of each ear is black, and so are\r\nhis feet.  He has rather a sharp nose.  Somehow when he is walking\r\nhe makes me think of a little, flattened-out Bear with very short\r\nlegs.  And such claws as he has on his front feet!  I don\'t know\r\nany one with such big strong claws for his size.  I guess that must\r\nbe because he is such a digger."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a very good guess, Peter," said Old Mother Nature.  "Has\r\nany one here ever seen him dig?"\r\n\r\n"I did once," replied Peter.  "I happened to be over near where he\r\nlives when Farmer Brown\'s boy came along and surprised Digger some\r\ndistance from one of his holes.  Digger didn\'t try to get to one of\r\nthose holes; he simply began to dig.  My gracious, how the sand did\r\nfly!  He was out of sight in the ground before Farmer Brown\'s boy\r\ncould get to him.  Johnny Chuck is pretty good at digging, but he\r\nsimply isn\'t in the same class with Digger the Badger.  No one is\r\nthat I know of, unless it is Miner the Mole.  I guess this is all\r\nI know about him, excepting that he is a great fighter.  Once I saw\r\nhim whip a dog almost twice his size.  I never heard such hissing\r\nand snarling and growling.  He wouldn\'t tell me anything about how\r\nhe lives."\r\n\r\n"Very good, Peter, very good," replied Old Mother Nature, "That\'s\r\nas much as I expected you would be able to find out.  Digger is\r\na queer fellow.  His home is on the great plains and in the flat,\r\nopen country of the Middle West and Far West, where Gophers and\r\nGround Squirrels and Prairie Dogs live.  They furnish him with the\r\ngreater part of his food.  All of them are good diggers, but they\r\ndon\'t stand any chance when he sets out to dig them out.\r\n\r\n"Digger spends most of his time under ground during daylight, seldom\r\ncoming out except for a sun bath.  But as soon as jolly, round, red\r\nMr. Sun goes to bed for the night, Digger appears and travels about\r\nin search of a dinner.  His legs are so short and he is so stout and\r\nheavy that he is slow and rather clumsy, but he makes up for that by\r\nhis ability to dig.  He doesn\'t expect to catch any one on the surface,\r\nunless he happens to surprise a Meadow Mouse within jumping distance.\r\nHe goes hunting for the holes of Ground Squirrels and other burrowers,\r\nand when he finds one promptly digs.  He eats Grasshoppers, Beetles\r\nand small Snakes, as well as such small animals as he catches.  It\r\nwas well for you, Peter, that you jumped when you did, for I suspect\r\nthat Digger would have enjoyed a Rabbit dinner.\r\n\r\n"Very little is known of Digger\'s family life, but he is a good\r\nhusband.  In winter he sleeps as Johnny Chuck does, coming out soon\r\nafter the snow disappears in the spring.  Of all my little people,\r\nnone has greater courage.  When he is cornered he will fight as\r\nlong as there is a breath of life in him.  His skin is very tough\r\nand he is further protected by his long hair.  His teeth are sharp\r\nand strong and he can always give a good account of himself in a\r\nfight.  He is afraid of no one of his own size.\r\n\r\n"Man hunts him for his fur, but man is very stupid in many things and\r\nthis is an example.  You see, Digger is worth a great deal more alive\r\nthan dead, because of the great number of destructive Rodents he\r\nkills.  The only thing that can be brought against him is the number\r\nof holes he digs.  Mr. and Mrs. Digger have two to five babies late\r\nin the spring or early in the summer.  They are born under ground in\r\na nest of grass.  As you may guess just by looking at Digger, he is\r\nvery strong.  If he once gets well into the ground, a strong man\r\npulling on his tail cannot budge him.  As Peter has pointed out, he\r\nisn\'t at all sociable.  Mr. and Mrs. Digger are quite satisfied to\r\nlive by themselves and be left alone.  So he is rarely seen in\r\ndaytime, but probably is out oftener than is supposed.  Peter has\r\ntold how he nearly stepped on Digger before seeing him.  It is\r\nDigger\'s wise habit to lie perfectly still until he is sure he has\r\nbeen seen, so people often pass him without seeing him at all, or\r\nif they see him they take him for a stone.\r\n\r\n"While Digger the Badger is a lover of the open country and doesn\'t\r\nlike the Green Forest at all he has a cousin who is found only in\r\nthe Green Forest and usually very deep in the Green Forest at that.\r\nThis is Glutton the Wolverine, the largest and ugliest member of the\r\nfamily.  None of you have seen him, because he lives almost wholly\r\nin the great forests of the North.  He hasn\'t a single friend that\r\nI know of, but that doesn\'t trouble him in the least.\r\n\r\n"Glutton has several names.  He is called \'Carcajou\' in the Far\r\nNorth, and out in the Far West is often called \'Skunkbear.\'  The\r\nlatter name probably is given him because in shape and color he\r\nlooks a good deal as though he might be half Skunk and half Bear.\r\nHe is about three feet long with a tail six inches long, and is\r\nthickset and heavy.  His legs are short and very stout.  His hair,\r\nincluding that on the tail, is long and shaggy.  It is\r\nblackish-brown, becoming grayish on the upper part of his head and\r\ncheeks. His feet are black.  When he walks he puts his feet flat on the\r\nground as a Bear does.\r\n\r\n"Being so short of leg and heavy of body, he is slow in his movements.\r\nBut what he lacks in this respect he makes up in strength and cunning.\r\nYou think Reddy Fox and Old Man Coyote are smart, but neither begins\r\nto be as smart as Glutton the Wolverine.  He is a great traveler, and\r\nin the Far North where the greater part of the fur of the world is\r\ntrapped, he is a pest to the trappers.  He will follow a trapper all\r\nday long, keeping just out of sight.  No matter how carefully a trapper\r\nhides a trap, Glutton will find it and steal the bait without getting\r\ncaught.  Sometimes he even tears up the traps and takes them off and\r\nhides them in the woods.  If he comes on a trap in which some other\r\nanimal has been caught, he will eat the animal.  His strength is so\r\ngreat that often he will tear his way into the cabins of hunters while\r\nthey are absent and then eat or destroy all their food.  His appetite\r\nis tremendous, and it is because of this that he is called Glutton.\r\nWhat he cannot eat or take away, he covers with filth so that no\r\nother animal will touch it.  He is of ugly disposition and is hated\r\nalike by the animals and by man.  His fur is of considerable value,\r\nbut he is hunted more for the purpose of getting rid of him than for\r\nhis fur.  Sometimes when caught in a trap he will pick it up and\r\ncarry it for miles.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Glutton has two or three babies in the spring.  They live\r\nin a cave, but if a cave cannot be found, they use a hole in the\r\nground which Mrs. Glutton digs.  It is usually well hidden and seldom\r\nhas been found by man.  Glutton will eat any kind of flesh and seems\r\nnot to care whether it be freshly killed or so old that it is decayed.\r\nThe only way that hunters can protect their supplies is by covering\r\nthem with great logs.  Even then Glutton will often tear the logs\r\napart to get at the supplies.  Because of his great cunning, the\r\nIndians think he is possessed of an evil spirit.\r\n\r\n"I think this will do for to-day.  To-morrow we will take up\r\nanother branch of the family, some members of which all of you\r\nknow.  I wonder if it wouldn\'t be a good plan to have Shadow\r\nthe Weasel here."\r\n\r\nSuch a look of dismay as swept over the faces of all those little\r\npeople, with the exception of Jimmy Skunk and Prickly Porky!  "If--\r\nif--if you please, I don\'t think I\'ll come to-morrow morning," said\r\nDanny Meadow Mouse.\r\n\r\n"I--I--I think I shall be too busy at home and will have to miss\r\nthat lesson," said Striped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled.  "Don\'t worry, little folks," said she.\r\n"You ought to know that if I had Shadow here I wouldn\'t let him\r\nhurt one of you.  But I am afraid if he were here you would pay\r\nno attention to me, so I promise you that Shadow will not be\r\nanywhere near."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV  Shadow and His Family\r\n\r\nEvery one was on hand when school opened the next morning, despite\r\nthe fear that the mere mention of Shadow the Weasel had aroused in\r\nall save Jimmy Skunk and Prickly Porky.  You see, all felt they must\r\nbe there so that they might learn all they possibly could about one\r\nthey so feared.  It might help them to escape should they discover\r\nShadow hunting them sometime.\r\n\r\n"Striped Chipmunk," said Old Mother Nature, "you know something about\r\nShadow the Weasel, tell us what you know."\r\n\r\n"I know I hate him!" declared Striped Chipmunk, and all the others\r\nnodded their heads in agreement.  "I don\'t know a single good thing\r\nabout him," he continued, "but I know plenty of bad things.  He is\r\nthe one enemy I fear more than any other because he is the one who\r\ncan go wherever I can.  Any hole I can get into he can.  I\'ve seen\r\nhim just twice in my life, and I hope I may never see him again."\r\n\r\n"What did he look like?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Like a snake on legs," declared Striped Chipmunk.  "Anyway, that\r\nis what he made me think of, because his body was so long and slim\r\nand he twisted and turned so easily.  He was about as long as\r\nChatterer the Red Squirrel but looked longer because of his slim\r\nbody and long neck.  He was brown above and white below.  His front\r\nfeet were white, and his hind feet rather whitish, but not clear\r\nwhite.  His short, round tail was black at the end.  Somehow his\r\nsmall head and sharp face made me think of a Snake.  Ugh!  I don\'t\r\nlike to think about him!"\r\n\r\n"I saw him once, and he wasn\'t brown at all.  Striped Chipmunk is\r\nall wrong, excepting about the end of his tail," interrupted Jumper\r\nthe Hare.  "He was all white, every bit of him but the end of his\r\ntail, that was black."\r\n\r\n"Striped Chipmunk is quite right and so are you," declared Old Mother\r\nNature.  "Striped Chipmunk saw him in summer and you saw him in winter.\r\nHe changes his coat according to season, just as you do yourself,\r\nJumper.  In winter he is trapped for his fur and he isn\'t called\r\nWeasel then at all, but Ermine."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Jumper and looked as if he felt a wee bit foolish.\r\n\r\n"What was he doing when you saw him?" asked Old Mother Nature, turning\r\nto Striped Chipmunk.\r\n\r\n"Hunting," replied Striped Chipmunk, and shivered.  "He was hunting\r\nme.  He had found my tracks where I had been gathering beechnuts,\r\nand he was following them with his nose just the way Bowser the\r\nHound follows Reddy Fox.  I nearly died of fright when I saw him."\r\n\r\n"You are lucky to be alive," declared Chatterer the Red Squirrel.\r\n\r\n"I know it," replied Striped Chipmunk and shivered again.  "I know\r\nit.  I guess I wouldn\'t be if Reddy Fox hadn\'t happened along just\r\nthen and frightened Shadow away.  I\'ve had a kindlier feeling for\r\nReddy Fox ever since."\r\n\r\n"I never ran harder in my life than the time I saw him," spoke up\r\nJumper the Hare.  "He was hunting me just the same way, running\r\nwith his nose in the snow and following every twist and turn I had\r\nmade.  But for that black-tipped tail I wouldn\'t have seen him\r\nuntil too late."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" exclaimed Jimmy Skunk.  "The idea of a big fellow like you\r\nrunning from such a little fellow as my Cousin Shadow!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not ashamed of running," declared Jumper.  "I may be ever so\r\nmuch bigger, but he is so quick I wouldn\'t stand the least chance\r\nin the world.  When I suspect Shadow is about, I go somewhere else,\r\nthe farther the better.  If I could climb a tree like Chatterer,\r\nit would be different."\r\n\r\n"No, it wouldn\'t!" interrupted Chatterer.  "No, it wouldn\'t.  That\r\nfellow can climb almost as well as I can.  The only thing that\r\nsaved me from him once was the fact that I could make a long jump\r\nfrom one tree to another and he couldn\'t.  He had found a hole in\r\na certain tree where I was living, and it was just luck that I\r\nwasn\'t at home when he called.  I was just returning when he\r\npopped out.  I ran for my life."\r\n\r\n"He is the most awful fellow in all the Great World," declared\r\nWhitefoot the Wood Mouse.\r\n\r\nJimmy Skunk chuckled right out.  "A lot you know about the Great\r\nWorld," he said.  "Why, you are farther from home now than you\'ve\r\never been in your life before, yet I could walk to it in a few\r\nminutes.  How do you know Shadow is the most awful fellow in the\r\nGreat World?"\r\n\r\n"I just know, that\'s all," retorted Whitefoot in a very positive\r\nthough squeaky voice.  "He hunts and kills just for the love of\r\nit, and no one, no matter how big he is, can do anything more\r\nawful than that.  I have a lot of enemies.  Sometimes it seems as\r\nif almost every one of my neighbors is looking for a Mouse dinner.\r\nBut all but Shadow the Weasel hunt me when they are hungry and\r\nneed food.  I can forgive them for that.  Every one must eat to\r\nlive.  But Shadow hunts me even when his stomach is so full he\r\ncannot eat another mouthful.  That fellow just loves to kill.\r\nHe takes pleasure in it.  That is what makes him so awful."\r\n\r\n"Whitefoot is right," declared Old Mother Nature, and she spoke\r\nsadly.  "If Shadow was as big as Buster Bear or Puma the Panther\r\nor even Tufty the Lynx, he would be the most terrible creature in\r\nall the Great World because of this awful desire to kill which\r\nfills him.  He is hot-blooded, quick-tempered and fearless.  Even\r\nwhen cornered by an enemy against whom he has no chance he will\r\nfight to the last gasp.  I am sorry to say that there is no\r\nkindness nor gentleness in him towards any save his own family.\r\nOutside of that he hasn\'t a friend in the world, not one."\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t he any enemies?" asked Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," replied Old Mother Nature.  "Reddy Fox, Old Man Coyote,\r\nHooty the Owl and various members of the Hawk family have to be\r\nwatched for by him.  But they do not worry him much.  You see he\r\nmoves so quickly, dodging out of sight in a flash, that whoever\r\ncatches him must be quick indeed.  Then, too, he is almost always\r\nclose to good cover.  He delights in old stone walls, stone piles,\r\nbrush-grown fences, piles of rubbish and barns and old buildings,\r\nthe places that Mice delight in.  In such places there is always\r\na hole to dart into in time of danger.  He hunts whenever he feels\r\nlike it, be it day or night, and often covers considerable ground,\r\nthough nothing to compare with his big, brown, water-loving cousin,\r\nBilly Mink.  It is because of his wonderful ability to disappear\r\nin an instant that he is called Shadow.\r\n\r\n"Shadow is known as the Common Weasel, Short-tailed Weasel, Brown\r\nWeasel, Bonaparte Weasel and Ermine, and is found all over the\r\nforested parts of the northern part of the country.  A little\r\nfarther south in the East is a cousin very much like him called the\r\nNew York Weasel.  On the Great Plains of the West is a larger cousin\r\nwith a longer tail called the Long-tailed Weasel, Large Ermine, or\r\nYellow-bellied Weasel.  His smallest cousin is the Least Weasel.\r\nThe latter is not much longer than a Mouse.  In winter he is all\r\nwhite, even the tip of his tail.  In summer he is a purer white\r\nunderneath than his larger cousins.  All of the Weasels are alike\r\nin habits.  When running they bound over the ground much as Peter\r\nRabbit does.\r\n\r\n"In that part of the West where Yap Yap the Prairie Dog lives is\r\na relative called the Blackfooted Ferret who looks like a large\r\nWeasel.  He is about the size of Billy Mink, but instead of the\r\nrich dark brown of Billy\'s coat his coat is a creamy yellow.  His\r\nfeet are black and so is the tip of his tail.  His face is whitish\r\nwith a dark band across the eyes.  He is most frequently found in\r\nPrairie dog towns and lives largely on Yap Yap and his friends.\r\nHis ways are those of Shadow and his cousins.  There is no one\r\nYap Yap fears quite as much.\r\n\r\n"The one good thing Shadow the Weasel does is to kill Robber the\r\nRat whenever they meet.  Robber, as you know, is big and savage\r\nand always ready for a fight when cornered.  But all the fight\r\ngoes out of him when Shadow appears.  Perhaps it is because he\r\nknows how hopeless it is.  When Shadow finds a barn overrun with\r\nRats he will sometimes stay until he has killed or driven out\r\nthe last one.  Then perhaps he spoils it all by killing a dozen\r\nChickens in a night.\r\n\r\n"It is a sad thing not to be able to speak well of any one, but\r\nShadow the Weasel, like Robber the Rat, has by his ways made\r\nhimself hated by all the little people of the Green Forest and\r\nthe Green Meadows and by man.  There is not one to say a good\r\nword for him.  Now to-morrow we will meet on the bank of the\r\nSmiling Pool instead of here."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV  Two Famous Swimmers\r\n\r\nThe bank of the Smiling Pool was a lovely place to hold school at\r\nthat hour of the day, which you know was just after sun-up.\r\nEverybody who could get there was on hand, and there were several\r\nwho had not been to school before.  One of these was Grandfather\r\nFrog, who was sitting on his big, green, lily pad.  Another was\r\nJerry Muskrat, whose house was out in the Smiling Pool.  Spotty\r\nthe Turtle was also there, not to mention Longlegs the Heron.  You\r\nsee, they hadn\'t come to school but the school had come to them,\r\nfor that is where they live or spend most of their time.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Jerry Muskrat," said Old Mother Nature pleasantly, as\r\nJerry\'s brown head appeared in the Smiling Pool.  "Have you seen\r\nanything of Billy Mink or Little Joe Otter?"\r\n\r\n"Little Joe went down to the Big River last night," replied Jerry\r\nMuskrat.  "I don\'t know when he is coming back, but I wouldn\'t be\r\nsurprised to see him any minute.  Billy Mink was here last evening and\r\nsaid he was going up the Laughing Brook fishing.  He is likely to be\r\nback any time.  One never can tell when that fellow will appear.  He\r\ncomes and goes continually.  I don\'t believe he can keep still five\r\nminutes."\r\n\r\n"Who is that can\'t keep still five minutes?" demanded a new voice,\r\nand there was Billy Mink himself just climbing out on the Big Rock.\r\n\r\n"Jerry was speaking of you," replied Old Mother Nature.  "This will\r\nbe a good chance for you to show him that he is mistaken.  I want\r\nyou to stay here for a while and to stay right on the Big Rock.  I\r\nmay want to ask you a few questions."\r\n\r\nJust then Billy Mink dived into the Smiling Pool, and a second later\r\nhis brown head popped out of the water and in his mouth was a fat\r\nfish.  He scrambled back on the Big Rock and looked at Old Mother\r\nNature a bit fearfully as he laid the fish down.\r\n\r\n"I--I didn\'t mean to disobey," he mumbled.  "I saw that fish and\r\ndived for him before I thought.  I hope you will forgive me, Mother\r\nNature.  I won\'t do it again."\r\n\r\n"Acting before thinking gets people into trouble sometimes," replied\r\nOld Mother Nature.  "However, I will forgive you this time.  The\r\nfact is you have just shown your friends here something.  Go ahead\r\nand eat that fish and be ready to answer questions."\r\n\r\nAs Billy Mink sat there on the Big Rock every one had a good look\r\nat him.  One glance would tell any one that he was a cousin of\r\nShadow the Weasel.  He was much larger than Shadow, but of the same\r\ngeneral shape, being long and slender.  His coat was a beautiful\r\ndark brown, darkest on the back.  His chin was white.  His tail was\r\nround, covered with fairly long hair which was so dark as to be almost\r\nblack.  His face was like that of Shadow the Weasel.  His legs were\r\nrather short.  As he sat eating that fish, his back was arched.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature waited until he had finished his feast.  "Now\r\nthen, Billy," said she, "I want you to answer a few questions.\r\nWhich do you like best, night or day?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t make any particular difference to me," replied Billy.\r\n"I just sleep when I feel like it, whether it be night or day, and\r\nthen when I wake up I can hunt.  It all depends on how I feel."\r\n\r\n"When you go hunting, what do you hunt?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nBilly grinned.  "Anything that promises a good meal," said he.  "I\'m\r\nnot very particular.  A fat Mouse, a tender young Rabbit, a Chipmunk,\r\na Frog, Tadpoles, Chickens, eggs, birds, fish; whatever happens to\r\nbe easiest to get suits me.  I am rather fond of fish, and that\'s\r\none reason that I live along the Laughing Brook and around the Smiling\r\nPool.  But I like a change of fare, and so often I go hunting in the\r\nGreen Forest.  Sometimes I go up to Farmer Brown\'s for a Chicken.  In\r\nthe spring I hunt for nests of birds on the ground.  In winter, if\r\nPeter Rabbit should happen along here when I was hungry, I might be\r\ntempted to sample Peter."  Billy snapped his bright eyes wickedly\r\nand Peter shivered.\r\n\r\n"If Jerry Muskrat were not my friend, I am afraid I might be tempted\r\nto sample him," continued Billy Mink.\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" exclaimed Peter Rabbit.  "You wouldn\'t dare tackle Jerry Muskrat."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t I?" replied Billy.  "Just ask Jerry how he feels about it."\r\n\r\nOne look at Jerry\'s face showed everybody that Jerry, big as he was,\r\nwas afraid of Billy Mink.  "How do you hunt when you are on land?"\r\nasked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"The way every good hunter should hunt, with eyes, nose and ears,"\r\nreplied Billy.  "There may be folks with better ears than I\'ve got,\r\nbut I don\'t know who they are.  I wouldn\'t swap noses with anybody.\r\nAs for my eyes, well, they are plenty good enough for me."\r\n\r\n"In other words, you hunt very much as does your cousin, Shadow the\r\nWeasel," said Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nBilly nodded.  "I suppose I do," said he, "but there\'s one thing he\r\ndoes which I don\'t do and that\'s hunt just for the love of killing.\r\n\r\n"Once in a while I may kill more than I can eat, but I don\'t mean to.\r\nI hunt for food, while he hunts just for the love of killing."\r\n\r\n"You all saw how Billy catches fish," said Old Mother Nature. "Now,\r\nBilly, I want you to swim over to the farther bank and show us how\r\nyou run."\r\n\r\nBilly obeyed.  He slipped into the water, dived, swam under water\r\nfor a distance, then swam with just his head out.  When he reached\r\nthe bank he climbed out and started along it.  He went by a series\r\nof bounds, his back arched sharply between each leap.  Then he\r\ndisappeared before their very eyes, only to reappear as suddenly\r\nas he had gone.  So quick were his movements that it was impossible\r\nfor one of the little people watching to keep their eyes on him.\r\nIt seemed sometimes as though he must have vanished into the air.\r\nOf course he didn\'t.  He was simply showing them his wonderful\r\nability to take advantage of every little stick, stone and bush.\r\n\r\n"Billy is a great traveler," said Old Mother Nature.  "He really\r\nloves to travel up and down the Laughing Brook, even for long\r\ndistances.  Wherever there is plenty of driftwood and rubbish,\r\nBilly is quite at home, being so slender he can slip under all\r\nkinds of places and into all sorts of holes.  Quick as he is on\r\nland, he is not so quick as his Cousin Shadow; and good swimmer\r\nas he is, he isn\'t so good as his bigger cousin, Little Joe Otter.\r\nBut being equally at home on land and in water, he has an advantage\r\nover his cousins.  Billy is much hunted for his fur, and being\r\nhunted so much has made him very keen-witted.  Mrs. Billy makes\r\nher home nest in a hole in the bank or under an old stump or under\r\na pile of driftwood, and you may be sure it is well hidden.\r\nThere the babies are born, and they stay with their mother all\r\nsummer.  Incidentally, Billy can climb readily.  Billy is found\r\nall over this great country of ours.  When he lives in the Far\r\nNorth his fur is finer and thicker than when he lives in the South.\r\nI wish Little Joe Otter were here.  I hoped he would be."\r\n\r\n"Here he comes now," cried Jerry Muskrat.  "I rather expected he\r\nwould be back."  Jerry pointed towards where the Laughing Brook\r\nleft the Smiling Pool on its way to the Big River.  A brown head\r\nwas moving rapidly towards them.  There was no mistaking that head.\r\nIt could belong to no one but Little Joe Otter.  Straight on to\r\nthe Big Rock he came, and climbed up.  He was big, being one of\r\nthe largest members of his family.  He was more than three feet\r\nlong.  But no one looking at him could mistake him for any one but\r\na member of the Weasel family.  His legs were short, very short for\r\nthe length of his body.  His tail was fairly long and broad.  His\r\ncoat was a rich brown all over, a little lighter underneath than\r\non the back.\r\n\r\n"What\'s going on here?" asked Little Joe Otter, his eyes bright\r\nwith interest.\r\n\r\n"We are holding a session of school here today," explained Old\r\nMother Nature.  "And we were just hoping that you would appear.\r\nHold up one of your feet and spread the toes, Little Joe."\r\n\r\nLittle Joe Otter obeyed, though there was a funny, puzzled look\r\non his face.  "Whyee!" exclaimed Peter Rabbit.  "His toes are\r\nwebbed like those of Paddy the Beaver!"\r\n\r\n"Of course they\'re webbed," said Little Joe.  "I never could swim\r\nthe way I do if they weren\'t webbed."\r\n\r\n"Can you swim better than Paddy the Beaver?" asked Peter.\r\n\r\n"I should say I can.  If I couldn\'t, I guess I would go hungry most\r\nof the time," replied Little Joe.\r\n\r\n"Why should you go hungry?  Paddy doesn\'t," retorted Peter.\r\n\r\n"Paddy doesn\'t live on fish," replied Little Joe.  "I do and that\'s\r\nthe difference.  I can catch a fish in a tail-end race, and that\'s\r\ngoing some."\r\n\r\n"You might show us how you can swim," suggested Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nLittle Joe slipped into the water.  The Smiling Pool was very still\r\nand the little people sitting on the bank could look right down and\r\nsee nearly to the bottom.  They saw Little Joe as he entered the\r\nwater and then saw little more than a brown streak.  A second later\r\nhis head popped out on the other side of the Smiling Pool.\r\n\r\n"Phew, I\'m glad I\'m not a fish!" exclaimed Peter and everybody laughed.\r\n\r\n"You may well be glad," said Old Mother Nature.  "You wouldn\'t stand\r\nmuch chance with Little Joe around.  Like Billy Mink, Little Joe is\r\na great traveler, especially up and down the Laughing Brook and the\r\nBig River.  Sometimes he travels over land, but he is so heavy and\r\nhis legs are so short that traveling on land is slow work.  When he\r\ndoes cross from one stream or pond to another, he always picks out\r\nthe smoothest going.  Sometimes in winter he travels quite a bit.\r\nThen when he comes to a smooth hill, he slides down it on his\r\nstomach.  By the way, Little Joe, haven\'t you a slippery slide\r\nsomewhere around here?"\r\n\r\nLittle Joe nodded.  "I\'ve got one down the Laughing Brook where\r\nthe bank is steep," said he.  "Mrs. Otter and I and our children\r\nslide every day."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by a slippery slide?" asked Happy Jack Squirrel,\r\nwho was sitting in the Big Hickory-tree which grew on the bank\r\nof the Smiling Pool.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled.  "Little Joe Otter and his family are\r\nquite as fond of play as any of my children," said she.  "They get\r\na lot of fun out of life.  One of their ways of playing is to make\r\na slippery slide where the bank is steep and the water deep.  In\r\nwinter it is made of snow, but in summer it is made of mud.  There\r\nthey slide down, splash into the water, then climb up the bank\r\nand do it all over again.  In winter they make their slippery slide\r\nwhere the water doesn\'t freeze, and they get just as much fun in\r\nwinter as they do in summer."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that means that Little Joe doesn\'t sleep in winter as\r\nJohnny Chuck does," said Peter.\r\n\r\n"I should say not," exclaimed Little Joe.  "I like the winter, too.\r\nI have such a warm coat that I never get cold.  There are always\r\nplaces where the water doesn\'t freeze.  I can swim for long distances\r\nunder ice and so I can always get plenty of food."\r\n\r\n"Do you eat anything but fish?" asked Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Oh, sometimes," replied Little Joe.  "Once in a while I like a\r\nlittle fresh meat for a change, and sometimes when fish are\r\nscarce I eat Frogs, but I prefer fish, especially Salmon and Trout."\r\n\r\n"How many babies do you have at a time?" asked Happy Jack Squirrel.\r\n\r\n"Usually one to three," replied Little Joe, "and only one family\r\na year.  They are born in my comfortable house, which is a burrow\r\nin the bank.  There Mrs. Otter makes a large, soft nest of leaves\r\nand grass.  Now, if you don\'t mind, I think I will go on up the\r\nLaughing Brook.  Mrs. Otter is waiting for me up there."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature told Little Joe to go ahead.  As he disappeared,\r\nshe sighed.  "I\'m very fond of Little Joe Otter," said she, "and\r\nit distresses me greatly that he is hunted by man as he is.  That\r\nfur coat of his is valuable, and man is forever hunting him for\r\nit.  The Otters were once numerous all over this great country,\r\nbut now they are very scarce, and I am afraid that the day isn\'t\r\nfar away when there will be no Little Joe Otter.  I think this will\r\ndo for to-day.  There are two other members of the Weasel family\r\nand these, like Little Joe and Billy Mink, are continually being\r\nhunted for their fur coats.  I will tell you about them to-morrow."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI  Spite the Marten and Pekan the Fisher\r\n\r\n"The two remaining members of the Weasel family none of you have\r\never seen," began Old Mother Nature, when she opened school at\r\nthe old meeting place in the Green Forest the morning after their\r\nvisit to the Smiling Pool.  "You have never seen them because they\r\nlive in the deep forests of the Far North.  But were you living up\r\nthere, you would know them, and the dread of them would seldom be\r\nout of your mind.  One is called Spite the Marten and the other\r\nPekan the Fisher.\r\n\r\n"Spite the Marten is also called the Pine Marten and the American\r\nSable, and he is one of the handsomest members of the Weasel family.\r\nShadow the Weasel can climb, but he spends most of his time on the\r\nground.  Jimmy Skunk and Digger the Badger are not climbers at all.\r\nLittle Joe Otter spends most of his time in the water.  But Spite\r\nthe Marten is a lover of the tree tops, and is quite as much at home\r\nthere as Chatterer the Red Squirrel.\r\n\r\n"When he is moving about in the trees, he looks much like a very\r\nlarge Squirrel, while on the ground he might be mistaken for a\r\nyoung Fox.  His coat is a rich, dark, yellowish-brown, becoming\r\nalmost black on the tail and legs.  His throat usually is yellow,\r\nthough sometimes it is almost white.  The sides of his face are\r\ngrayish, and his good-sized ears are grayish-white on the inside.\r\nHis tail is about half as long as his body and is covered with\r\nlong hair, but isn\'t bushy like a Squirrel\'s.  While his general\r\nshape is that of Shadow the Weasel, his body is much heavier in\r\nproportion to his size.\r\n\r\n"Chatterer, you and your Cousin Happy Jack may well be thankful\r\nthat Spite the Marten doesn\'t live about here, for he is very fond\r\nof Squirrels and delights to hunt them.  He can leap from tree to\r\ntree quite as easily as either of you, and the only possible means\r\nof escape for a Squirrel he is hunting is a hole too small for\r\nSpite to get into.  No Squirrel is more graceful in the trees\r\nthan is Spite.\r\n\r\n"But he by no means confines himself to the trees.  He is quite at\r\nhome on the ground, and there he moves with much of the quickness\r\nof Shadow the Weasel.  He delights to hunt Rabbits and he covers\r\ngreat distances, being even more of a traveller than Billy Mink.\r\nHe doesn\'t kill for the love of killing, but merely for food.  If\r\nhe kills more than he can eat at a meal he buries it, and when he\r\nis hungry again he returns to it.  Like all the other members of\r\nhis family, he is a great hunter of Mice.  Also he catches many\r\nbirds, especially those birds which nest on the ground.  Birds,\r\neggs, Frogs, Toads, some insects and fish vary his bill of fare.\r\nBut unlike his smaller cousins, he eats some other things besides\r\nflesh, including certain nuts, berries and honey.\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t in the least social with his own kind but prefers to\r\nlive alone and is always ready to fight if he meets another\r\nMarten.  Being so great a traveler he has several dens.  Mrs. Spite\r\nmakes her nest of grass and moss in a hollow tree as a rule,\r\noccasionally in a hole in the ground.  She has from one to five\r\nbabies in the spring.  Spite is not a good father, for he has\r\nnothing to do with his family.\r\n\r\n"As I told you in the beginning he is found only in the great forests\r\nof the North.  The darker and deeper they are, the better it suits\r\nhim.  His own cousin, Pekan the Fisher, and Tufty the Lynx, are\r\nprobably the only natural enemies he has much cause to fear.  His one\r\ngreat enemy is man.  His coat is one of the most highly prized of all\r\nfurs and he is persistently hunted and trapped.  In fact, his coat is\r\none of the chief prizes of the fur trappers.\r\n\r\n"In this same deep, dark forest clear across the northern part of\r\nthe country lives Pekan the Fisher, also called the Pennant Marten\r\nand Blackcat.  He is larger and heavier than Spite the Marten and\r\nhis coat is a brownish-black, light on the sides, and browner below.\r\nHis nose, ears, feet and tail are black.  He gets his name of Blackcat\r\nfrom his resemblance to a Cat with a bushy tail, though on the ground\r\nhe looks more like a black Fox.  Like his cousin, Spite the Marten,\r\nhe lives in the pine and spruce forests and prefers to be near swamps.\r\nHe is a splendid climber but spends quite as much time on the ground.\r\nHowever, he is even livelier in the trees than is Spite the Marten.\r\nSpite can catch a Squirrel in the tree tops, but Pekan can catch Spite,\r\nand often does.  He isn\'t afraid of leaping to the ground from high up\r\nin a tree, and often when coming down a tree he comes down headfirst.\r\nHe is very fond of hunting the cousins of Jumper the Hare and is so\r\ntireless that he can run them down.  He is very clever and, like his\r\ncousin, Glutton the Wolverine, makes no end of trouble for trappers\r\nby stealing the baits from their traps.\r\n\r\n"You all remember how frightened Prickly Porky was when I merely\r\nmentioned Pekan the Fisher.  It was because Pekan is almost the\r\nonly one Prickly Porky has reason to fear.  If Pekan is hungry he\r\ndoesn\'t hesitate to dine on Porcupine.  He has learned how to turn\r\na Porcupine on his back, and, as you have already found out, the\r\nunder part of the Porcupine is unprotected.\r\n\r\n"Just why Pekan should be called Fisher, I don\'t know.  True, he\r\neats fish when he can get them, but he isn\'t a water animal and\r\ndoesn\'t go fishing as do Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter.  His food\r\nis much the same as that of Spite the Marten.  He is especially fond\r\nof Rabbit and Hare.  He is so strong and savage that he can kill a\r\nFox and often does.  Bobby Coon is a good fighter and much bigger\r\nand heavier than Pekan, but he is no match for Pekan.\r\n\r\n"Probably all of you have guessed that being a true Marten, Pekan\'s\r\ncoat is highly prized by the fur trappers.  He hates the presence of\r\nman and with good cause.\r\n\r\n"Now this ends the Weasel family, but that\'s only one family of the\r\norder of Carnivora, or flesh eaters.  There is one family you all\r\nknow so well that I think we will take that up next.  It is the\r\nfamily to which Reddy Fox and Old Man Coyote belong, and it is\r\ncalled the Dog family.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow morning when you get here, I may have a surprise for you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII  Reddy Fox Joins the School\r\n\r\nWhen school was called to order the following morning not one was\r\nmissing.  You see, with the exception of Jimmy Skunk and Prickly\r\nPorky, there was not one in whose life Reddy Fox did not have a most\r\nimportant part.  Even Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel and Chatterer\r\nthe Red Squirrel, tree folk though they were, had many times\r\nnarrowly missed furnishing Reddy with a dinner.  As for Johnny Chuck\r\nand Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and Striped Chipmunk and Danny\r\nMeadow Mouse and Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, there were few hours of\r\nday or night when they did not have Reddy in mind, knowing that to\r\nforget him even for a few minutes might mean the end of them.\r\n\r\nJust imagine the feelings of these little people when, just as they\r\nhad comfortably seated themselves for the morning lesson, Reddy\r\nhimself stepped out from behind a tree.  Never before was a school\r\nso quickly broken up.  In the winking of an eye Old Mother Nature\r\nwas alone, save for Reddy Fox, Jimmy Skunk, and in the trees Prickly\r\nPorky the Porcupine and Happy Jack and Chatterer.\r\n\r\nReddy Fox looked as if he felt uncomfortable.  "I didn\'t mean to\r\nbreak up your school," said he to Old Mother Nature.  "I wouldn\'t\r\nhave thought of coming if you hadn\'t sent for me."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled.  "I didn\'t tell any one that I was going\r\nto send for you, Reddy," said she, "for I was afraid that if I did\r\nno one would come this morning.  I promised them a surprise, but it\r\nis clear that no one guessed what that surprise was to be.  Go over\r\nby that old stump near the Lone Little Path and sit there, Reddy."\r\n\r\nThen Old Mother Nature called each of the little people by name,\r\ncommanding each to return at once.  She spoke sternly, very sternly\r\nindeed.  One by one they appeared from all sorts of hiding places,\r\nglancing fearfully towards Reddy Fox, yet not daring to disobey\r\nOld Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nWhen at last all were crowded about her as closely as they could\r\nget, Old Mother Nature spoke and this time her voice was soft.  "I\r\nam ashamed of you," said she.  "Truly I am ashamed of you.  How\r\ncould you think that I would allow any harm to come to you?  Reddy\r\nFox is here because I sent for him, but he is going to sit right\r\nwhere he is until I tell him he can go, and not one of you will be\r\nharmed by him.  To begin with, I am going to tell you one or two\r\nfacts about Reddy, and then I am going to find out just how much\r\nyou have learned about him yourselves.\r\n\r\n"It may seem queer to you that Reddy Fox belongs to the same family\r\nas Bowser the Hound, but it is true.  Both are members of the Dog\r\nfamily and thus are quite closely related.  Howler the Wolf and Old\r\nMan Coyote are also members of the family, so all are cousins.\r\nLook closely at Reddy and you will see at once that he looks very\r\nmuch like a small Dog with a beautiful red coat, white waistcoat,\r\nblack feet and bushy tail.  Now, Peter, you probably know as much\r\nabout Reddy as any one here.  At least you should.  Tell us what\r\nyou have learned in your efforts to keep out of his clutches."\r\n\r\nPeter scratched a long ear thoughtfully and glanced sideways at\r\nReddy Fox.  "I certainly ought to know something about him," he\r\nbegan.  "He was the very first person my mother warned me to watch\r\nfor, because she said he was especially fond of young Rabbits and\r\nwas the slyest, smartest and most to be feared of all my enemies.\r\nSince then I have found out that she knew just what she was talking\r\nabout."  Johnny Chuck, Danny Meadow Mouse and Whitefoot the Wood\r\nMouse nodded as if they quite agreed.  Then Peter continued, "Reddy\r\nlives chiefly by hunting, and in his turn he is hunted, so he needs\r\nto have sharp wits.  When he isn\'t hunting me he is hunting Danny\r\nMeadow Mouse or Whitefoot or Striped Chipmunk or Mrs. Grouse, or\r\nBob White, or is trying to steal one of Farmer Brown\'s Chickens,\r\nor is catching Frogs along the edge of the Smiling Pool, or\r\ngrasshoppers out in the Green Meadows.  So far as I can make out,\r\nanything Reddy can catch furnishes him with food.  I guess he doesn\'t\r\neat anything but such things as these."\r\n\r\n"Your guess is wrong, Peter," spoke up Reddy Fox, who had been\r\nlistening with a grin on his crafty face.  "I am rather fond of\r\ncertain kinds of fruits.  You didn\'t know that, did you, Peter?"\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t," replied Peter.  "I\'m glad to know it.  I think it\r\nis dreadful to live entirely by killing others."\r\n\r\n"You might add," remarked Reddy, "that I like a meal of fish\r\noccasionally, and eggs are always welcome.  I am not particular\r\nwhat I eat so long as I can get my stomach full."\r\n\r\n"Reddy Fox hunts with ears, eyes and nose," continued Peter.  "Many\r\na time I\'ve watched him listening for the squeak of Danny Meadow\r\nMouse or watching for the grass to move and show where Danny was\r\nhiding; and many a time he has found my scent with his wonderful\r\nnose and followed me just as Bowser the Hound follows him.  I guess\r\nthere isn\'t much going on that Reddy\'s eyes, ears and nose don\'t\r\ntell him.  But it is Reddy\'s quick wits that the rest of us fear\r\nmost.  We never know what new trick he will try.  Lots of enemies\r\nare easy to fool, but Reddy isn\'t one of them.  Sometimes I think\r\nhe knows more about me than I know about myself.  I guess it is\r\njust pure luck that he hasn\'t caught me with some of those smart\r\ntricks of his.\r\n\r\n"Reddy hunts both day and night, but I think he prefers night.  I\r\nguess it all depends on how hungry he is.  More than once I\'ve\r\nseen him bringing home a Chicken, but I am told that he is smart\r\nenough not to steal Chickens near his home, but always to go some\r\ndistance to get them.  Also I\'ve been told that he is too clever\r\nto go to the same Chicken yard two nights in succession.  So far\r\nas I know, he isn\'t afraid of any one except a hunter with a\r\nterrible gun.  He doesn\'t seem to mind being chased by Bowser the\r\nHound at all."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t," spoke up Reddy.  "I rather enjoy it.  It gives me good\r\nexercise.  Any time I can\'t fool Bowser by breaking my trail so he\r\ncan\'t find it again, I deserve to be caught.  I am not even so\r\nterribly afraid of a hunter with a gun.  You see, usually I can\r\nguess what a hunter will do better than he can what I will do."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature nodded.  "That sounds like boasting," said she,\r\n"but it isn\'t.  Reddy Fox is one of the few animals who has\r\nsucceeded in holding his own against man, and he has done it simply\r\nby using his wits.  There is no other animal as large as Reddy Fox\r\nwho has succeeded as he has in living close to the homes of men.\r\nIt is simply because he has made the most of the senses I have given\r\nhim.  He has learned to use his eyes, ears and nose at all times and\r\nto understand and make the most of the information they bring him.\r\nReddy has always been hunted by man, and it is this very thing which\r\nhas so sharpened his wits.  It is seldom that he is guilty of making\r\nthe same mistake twice.  All of you little people fear Reddy, and I\r\nsuspect some of you hate him.  But always remember that he never\r\nkills for the love of killing, and only when he must have food.\r\nThere would be something sadly missing in the Green Forest and on\r\nthe Green Meadows were there no Reddy Fox.  Reddy, where do you and\r\nMrs. Reddy make your home?  And how do you raise your babies?"\r\n\r\n"This year our home is up in the Old Pasture," replied Reddy.  "We\r\nhave the nicest kind of a house dug in the ground underneath a big\r\nrock.  It has only one entrance, but this is because there is no\r\nneed of any other.  No one could possibly dig us out there.  Last\r\nyear our home was on the Green Meadows and there were three doorways\r\nto that.  The year before we dug our house in a gravelly bank just\r\nwithin the edge of the Green Forest.  The babies are born in a\r\ncomfortable bedroom deep underground.  Sometimes we have a storeroom\r\nin addition to the bedroom; there Mrs. Reddy and I can keep food\r\nwhen there is more than can be eaten at one meal.  When the babies\r\nare first born in the spring and Mrs. Reddy cannot leave them, I\r\ntake food to her.  When the youngsters are big enough to use their\r\nsharp little teeth, we take turns hunting food for them.  Usually\r\nwe hunt separately, but sometimes we hunt together.  You know often\r\ntwo can do what one cannot.  If Bowser the Hound happens to find\r\nthe trail of Mrs. Reddy when there are babies at home, she leads him\r\nfar away from our home.  Then I join her, and take her place so that\r\nshe can slip away and go back to the babies.  Bowser never knows\r\nthe difference.\r\n\r\n"Our children are well trained if I do say it.  We teach them how to\r\nhunt, how to fool their enemies, and all the tricks we have learned.\r\nNo one has a better training than a young Fox."\r\n\r\n"Here is a conundrum for you little folks," said Old Mother Nature.\r\n"When is a Red Fox not a Red Fox?"  Everybody blinked.  Most of\r\nthem looked as if they thought Old Mother Nature must be joking.\r\nBut suddenly Chatterer the Red Squirrel, whose wits are naturally\r\nquick, remembered how Old Mother Nature had told them that there\r\nwere black Gray Squirrels.  "When he is some other color,"\r\ncried Chatterer.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the answer," said Old Mother Nature.  "Once in a while a\r\npair of Red Foxes will have a baby who hasn\'t a red hair on him.\r\nHe will be all black, with perhaps just the tip of his tail white.\r\nOr his fur will be all black just tipped with white.  Then he is\r\ncalled a Black Fox or Silver Fox.  He is still a Red Fox, yet\r\nthere is nothing red about him.  Sometimes the fur is only partly\r\nmarked with black and then he is called a Cross Fox.  A great many\r\npeople have supposed that the Black or Silver Fox and the Cross Fox\r\nwere distinct kinds.  They are not.  They are simply Red Foxes with\r\ndifferent coats.  The fur of the Silver Fox is considered by man to\r\nbe one of the choicest of all furs and tremendous prices are paid\r\nfor it.  This means, of course, that a young Fox whose coat is\r\nblack will need to be very smart indeed if he would live to old\r\nage, for once he has been seen by man he will be hunted unceasingly."\r\n\r\nReddy Fox had been listening intently and now Mother Nature\r\nnoticed a worried look on his face.  "What is it, Reddy?" said\r\nshe.  "You look anxious."\r\n\r\n"I am anxious," said he.  "What you have just said has worried me.\r\nYou see, one of my cubs at home is all black.  Now that I have\r\nlearned that his fur is so valuable, Mrs. Reddy and I will have\r\nto take special pains to teach him all we know."\r\n\r\n"I want you all to know that Reddy Fox and Mrs. Reddy mate for\r\nlife," said Old Mother Nature.  "Reddy is the best of fathers and\r\nthe best of mates."\r\n\r\n"There\'s one thing I do envy Reddy," spoke up Peter Rabbit, "and\r\nthat is that big tail of his.  It is a wonderful tail.  I wish I\r\nhad one like it."\r\n\r\nHow everybody laughed as they tried to picture Peter Rabbit with a\r\nbig tail like that of Reddy Fox.  "I am afraid you wouldn\'t get far\r\nif you had to carry that around," said Old Mother Nature.  "Even\r\nReddy finds it rather a burden in wet weather when it becomes heavy\r\nwith water.  That is one reason you do not find him abroad much when\r\nit is raining or in winter when the snow is soft and wet.  Reddy Fox\r\nis at home all over the northern half of this country, and everywhere\r\nhe is the same sly, clever fellow whom you all know so well.\r\n\r\n"In the South and some parts of the East and West, Reddy has a\r\ncousin of about his own size whose coat is gray with red on the\r\nsides of his neck, ears and across his breast.  The under part of\r\nhis body is reddish, his throat and the middle of his breast are\r\nwhite.  He is called the Gray Fox.  He prefers the Green Forest to\r\nthe open country, for he is not nearly as smart as his Cousin Reddy.\r\nHe is, if anything, a better runner, but his wits are slower and he\r\ncannot so well hold his own against man.  Instead of making his home\r\nin a hole in the ground, he usually chooses a hollow tree-trunk or\r\nhollow log.  The babies are born in a nest of leaves in the bottom\r\nof a hollow tree.  In some parts of the West this Fox is called the\r\nTree Fox, because often he climbs up in low trees.\r\n\r\n"The Gray Fox of the South is not the only cousin of Reddy\'s,"\r\ncontinued Old Mother Nature.  "In certain parts of the Great West,\r\non the plains, lives one of the smallest of Reddy\'s cousins,\r\ncalled the Kit Fox or Swift.  He is no larger than Black Pussy,\r\nFarmer Brown\'s Cat, and gets his name of Swift from his great\r\nspeed in running.  He is a prairie animal and lives in burrows in\r\nthe ground as most prairie animals do.  His back is of a grayish\r\ncolor, while his sides are yellowish red.  Beneath he is white.\r\nThe upper side of his tail is yellowish-gray, below it is yellowish,\r\nand the tip is black.  In general appearance he is more like the\r\nGray Fox than Reddy.  He lacks the quick wit of Reddy Fox and is\r\neasily trapped.\r\n\r\n"In the hot, dry regions of the Southwest, where the Kangaroo Rats\r\nand Pocket Mice live, is another cousin, closely related to the Kit\r\nFox.  This is called the Desert Fox.  Like most of the little people\r\nwho live on the desert, he is seldom seen by day.  He is very swift\r\nof foot.  He digs a burrow with several entrances and his food consists\r\nlargely of Pocket Mice, Kangaroo Rats, Ground squirrels and such other\r\nsmall animals as are found in that part of the country.  Like his\r\ncousin, the Kit Fox, he is not especially quick-witted.  Neither the Kit\r\nFox nor the Desert Fox are considered very valuable for their coats, and\r\nso are not hunted and trapped as much as are Reddy Fox and his two\r\ncousins of the Great North, the Arctic Fox and the Blue Fox.\r\n\r\n"The Arctic, or White Fox, lives in the Far North, in the land of\r\nsnow and ice.  He is a little fellow, bigger than the Kit Fox, but\r\nonly about two thirds the size of Reddy Fox, and very beautiful.\r\nWay up in the Far North his entire coat is snowy white the year\r\nround.  The fur is long, very thick and soft.  His tail is very\r\nlarge and handsome.  When he lives a little farther south, he\r\nchanges his coat in the summer to one of a bluish-brown.  But just\r\nas soon as winter approaches, he resumes his white coat.  The\r\nyoung are born in a burrow in the ground, if the parents happen\r\nto be living far enough south for the ground to be free of snow.\r\nIn the Far North, their home is a burrow in a snow bank, and\r\nthere the babies are born.  The white coats of the Arctic Foxes,\r\nwho live in a world of white, are of great help to them when\r\nhunting, or when trying to escape from enemies.  It is difficult\r\nto see them against their white surroundings.  In summer their\r\nfood consists very largely of ducks and other wild fowl which nest\r\nin great numbers in the Far North.  In the winter they hunt for\r\nLemmings, Arctic Hares and a cousin of Mrs. Grouse called the\r\nPtarmigan, who lives up there.  They pick the bones left by Polar\r\nBears and Wolves.  Getting a living in winter is not easy, and so\r\nthe Arctic Fox is a great traveler.\r\n\r\n"The Blue Fox is really only a colored White Fox, just as the Black\r\nFox is a black Red Fox, and his habits are, of course, just the same\r\nas the habits of the White Fox.  There are some islands in the Far\r\nNorth, called the Pribilof Islands, and on them live many Blue\r\nFoxes.  Both the White and the Blue Foxes are much hunted for their\r\ncoats, which are considered very valuable by man.  Certainly they\r\nare very beautiful.  While these cousins of Reddy\'s are clever hunters\r\nthey do not begin to be as quick-witted as Reddy, and so are much\r\nmore easily trapped.\r\n\r\n"Now I think this will do for Reddy Fox and his relatives.  Reddy\r\nis going to stay right here with me, until the rest of you have\r\nhad a chance to get home.  After that you will have to watch out\r\nfor yourselves as usual.  Just remember that Reddy has become the\r\nquick-witted person he is because he has been so much hunted.  If\r\nyou are as smart as Reddy, you will understand that the more he\r\nhunts you, the quicker-witted you also will become.  To-morrow we\r\nwill take up Reddy\'s big cousins, the Wolves."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII  Old Man Coyote and Howler the Wolf\r\n\r\n"Of course, you all know to what branch of the Dog family Old Man\r\nCoyote belongs," said Old Mother Nature, and looked expectantly at\r\nthe circle of little folks gathered around her.  No one answered.\r\n"Well, well, well!" exclaimed Old Mother Nature, "I am surprised.\r\nI am very much surprised.  I supposed that all of you knew that\r\nOld Man Coyote is a member of the Wolf branch of the family."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that he is really a true Wolf?" asked Striped\r\nChipmunk timidly.\r\n\r\n"Of course," replied Old Mother Nature.  "He is all Wolf and nothing\r\nbut Wolf.  He is the Prairie Wolf, so called because he is a lover\r\nof the great open plains and not of the deep forests like his big\r\ncousin, Howler the Timber Wolf.  Reddy Fox is smart, but sometimes\r\nI believe Old Man Coyote is smarter.  You have got to get up very\r\nearly indeed to get ahead of Old Man Coyote.\r\n\r\n"Old Man Coyote varies in size from not so very much bigger than\r\nReddy Fox to almost the size of his big cousin, Howler the Timber\r\nWolf.  Also he varies in color from a general brownish-gray to a\r\nyellowish-brown, being whitish underneath.  His face is rather\r\nlonger than that of Reddy Fox.  He has a brushy tail, but it is\r\nnot as thick as Reddy\'s.\r\n\r\n"In his habits, Old Man Coyote is much like Reddy, but being larger\r\nand stronger he is able to kill larger animals, and has won the hate\r\nof man by killing young Pigs, Lambs, newly born Calves and poultry.\r\nBecause of this, he has been and is continually hunted and trapped.\r\nBut like Reddy Fox the more he is hunted the smarter he becomes,\r\nand he is quite capable of taking care of himself.  He is one of\r\nthe swiftest of all runners.  Many people think him cowardly because\r\nhe is always ready to run away at the least hint of danger.  He\r\nisn\'t cowardly, however; he is simply smart--too smart to run any\r\nunnecessary risk.  Old Man Coyote believes absolutely in safety\r\nfirst, a very wise rule for everybody.  The result is that he is\r\nseldom led into the mistake of simply thinking a thing is all\r\nright.  He makes sure that it is all right.  Because of this he\r\nis very hard to trap.  No matter how hungry he may be, he will\r\nturn his back on a baited trap, even when the trap is so cunningly\r\nhidden that he cannot see it.\r\n\r\n"Old Man Coyote is a good father and husband and a good provider\r\nfor his family.  He and Mrs. Coyote have a large family every year,\r\nsometimes as many as ten babies.  Their home is in the ground and\r\nis very similar to that of Reddy Fox.  They eat almost everything\r\neatable, including such animals and birds as they can catch, Frogs,\r\nToads, Snakes and insects, dead bodies they may find, and even some\r\nfruits.  Mr. and Mrs. Coyote often hunt together.  Sometimes, when\r\nthe children are full-grown, they all hunt together.  When they do\r\nthis they can pull down Lightfoot the Deer.\r\n\r\n"Old Man Coyote has one of the strangest voices to be heard anywhere,\r\nand he delights to use it, especially at night.  It is like many\r\nvoices shouting together, and one who hears it for the first time\r\ncannot believe that all that sound comes from one throat.\r\n\r\n"His big cousin, Howler the Gray Wolf, sometimes called Timber Wolf--\r\nis found now only in the forests of the North and the mountains of\r\nthe Great West.  Once he roamed over the greater part of this great\r\ncountry.  Howler is as keen-witted as, and perhaps keener-witted\r\nthan, Reddy Fox or Old Man Coyote, and added to this he has great\r\nstrength and courage.  He is one of the most feared of all the\r\npeople of the Green Forest.  In summer when food is plentiful,\r\nHowler and Mrs. Wolf devote themselves to the bringing up of their\r\nfamily and are careful not to be overbold.  But when winter comes,\r\nHowler and his friends get together and hunt in packs.  With their\r\nwonderful noses they can follow Lightfoot the Deer and run him down.\r\nThey kill Sheep and young Cattle.  The harder the winter the bolder\r\nthey become, and they have been known to attack man himself.  In the\r\nFar North they grow especially large, and because of the scarcity of\r\nfood there in winter, they become exceedingly fierce.  They can go an\r\nastonishingly long time without food and still retain their strength.\r\nBut hunger makes them merciless.  They  will not attack each other,\r\nbut if one in the pack becomes injured, the others will turn upon him,\r\nand kill and eat him at once.\r\n\r\n"Howler and Mrs. Wolf mate for life, and each is at all times loyal\r\nto the other.  They are the best of parents, and the little Wolves\r\nare carefully trained in all that a Wolf should know.  Always the\r\nhand of man has been against them, and this fact has developed their\r\nwits and cunning to a wonderful degree.  Man in his effort to destroy\r\nthem has used poison, cleverly hiding it in pieces of meat left where\r\nHowler and his friends could find them.  Howler soon found out that\r\nthere was something wrong with pieces of meat left about, and now it\r\nis seldom that any of his family come to harm in that way.  He is\r\nequally cunning in discovering traps, even traps buried in one of\r\nhis trails.  Sometimes he will dig them up and spring them without\r\nbeing caught.\r\n\r\n"When Wolves hunt in packs they have a leader, usually the strongest\r\nor the smartest among them, and this leader they obey.  In all the\r\ngreat forests there is no more dreadful sound than the howling of a\r\npack of wolves.  There is something in it that strikes terror to the\r\nhearts of all who hear it.\r\n\r\n"The color of Howler\'s coat usually is brownish-gray and that is\r\nwhy he is called the Gray Wolf; but sometimes it is almost black,\r\nand in the Far North it becomes snowy white.  Howler is very\r\nclosely related to the Dogs which men keep as pets.  They are\r\nreally first cousins.  Few Dogs dare meet Howler in battle."\r\n\r\n"My!" exclaimed Peter Rabbit, "I am glad Howler doesn\'t live\r\naround here."\r\n\r\n"You well may be," said Old Mother Nature.  "He would make just\r\nabout one bite of you, Peter."\r\n\r\nPeter shivered.  "Are Old Man Coyote and Howler friends?" asked Peter.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t call them exactly friends," replied Old Mother Nature.\r\n"Old Man Coyote takes pains to keep out of Howler\'s way, but he is\r\nclever enough to know that when Howler has made a good kill there\r\nmay be some left after Howler has filled his own stomach.  So when\r\nHowler is hunting in Old Man Coyote\'s neighbor hood, the latter\r\nkeeps an eye and ear open to what is going on.  In the long-ago\r\ndays when Thunderfoot the Bison was lord of the prairies, Howler\'s\r\nfamily lived on the prairies as well as in the forests, but now\r\nHowler sticks pretty closely to the forests and mountains, leaving\r\nthe prairies and brushy plains to Old Man Coyote."\r\n\r\n"All branches of the Dog family do one thing: they walk on their\r\ntoes.  They never put the whole foot down flat as does Buster Bear.\r\nAnd, as you have already discovered, all branches of the Dog family\r\nare very smart.  They are intelligent.  Hello, there is Black Pussy,\r\nthe cat from Farmer Brown\'s, coming down the Lone Little Path!  I\r\nsuspect it will be well for some of you smallest ones to get out\r\nof sight before she arrives.  She doesn\'t belong over here in the\r\nGreen Forest, but she has a cousin who does, Yowler the Bob Cat.\r\nShall I tell you about Yowler and his cousins to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"We\'d love to have you!" cried Happy Jack, speaking for all.\r\nThen, as Black Pussy was drawing near, they separated and went\r\ntheir several ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX  Yowler and His Cousin Tufty\r\n\r\nJumper the Hare arrived at school a little late and quite out of\r\nbreath from hurrying.  His big soft eyes were shining with\r\nexcitement.  "You look as though you had had an adventure, Jumper,"\r\nsaid Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"I have," replied Jumper. "It is a wonder I am here at all; I came\r\nto near furnishing Yowler the Bob Cat a breakfast that it makes me\r\nshiver just to think of it.  I guess if I hadn\'t been thinking about\r\nhim, he would have caught me."\r\n\r\n"Tell us all about it," demanded Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Seeing Black Pussy over here yesterday, and knowing that to-day\'s\r\nlesson was to be about Yowler, I couldn\'t get cats out of my mind\r\nall day yesterday," began Jumper.  "Black Pussy doesn\'t worry me,\r\nbut I must confess that if there is any one I fear, it is Yowler\r\nthe Bob Cat.  Just thinking about him make me nervous.  The more\r\nI tried not to think about him, the more I did think about him,\r\nand the more I thought about him, the more nervous I got.  Then\r\njust before dark, on the bank of the Laughing Brook, I found some\r\ntracks in the mud.  Those tracks were almost round, and that fact\r\nwas enough to tell me who had made them.  They were Yowler\'s\r\nfootprints, and they hadn\'t been made very long.\r\n\r\n"Of course, seeing those footprints made me more nervous than ever,\r\nand every time I saw a leaf move I jumped inside.  My heart felt\r\nas if it were up in my throat most of the time.  I had a feeling\r\nthat Yowler wasn\'t far away.  I hate that Cat!  I hate the way he\r\nhunts!  He goes sneaking about, without making a sound, or else he\r\nlies in wait, ready to spring without warning on the first one who\r\nhappens along.  A fellow never knows where to watch out for Yowler.\r\n\r\n"I spent nearly all night sitting under a little hemlock tree with\r\nbranches very close to the ground.  I sat there because I didn\'t\r\ndare do anything else.  As long as I stayed there I felt reasonably\r\nsafe, because Yowler would have to find me, and to do that he would\r\nhave to cross an open place where I could see him.  I knew that if\r\nI went roaming about I might walk right into his clutches.\r\n\r\n"It was lucky I had sense enough to stay there.  You know the moon\r\nwas very bright last night.  It made that open place in front of\r\nwhere I was hiding almost as light as day.  Once I closed my eyes\r\nfor just a minute.  When I opened them, there was Yowler sneaking\r\nacross that open place.  Where he had come from, I don\'t know.  He\r\nhadn\'t made a sound.  Not a leaf rustled under his big feet.  Right\r\nin the middle of that open place, where the moonlight was brightest,\r\nhe stopped to listen, and I simply held my breath."\r\n\r\n"Tell us how he looked," prompted Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"He looked just like what he is--a big Cat with a short tail,"\r\nreplied Jumper.  "Just to look at him any one would know he was\r\nown cousin to Black Pussy.  He had a round head, rather long legs,\r\nand was about twice as big as Black Pussy.  His feet looked big,\r\neven for him.  On the tips of his ears were a few long black hairs.\r\nHis coat was yellowish to reddish-brown, with dark spots on it.\r\nHis chin and throat were white, and underneath he was white spotted\r\nwith black.  There were spots all down his legs.  He didn\'t have\r\nenough of a tail to call it a tail.  It was whitish on the under\r\nside and had black stripes on the upper side, and all the time he\r\nkept twitching it just the way Black Pussy twitches her tail when\r\nshe is out hunting.  All of a sudden he opened his mouth and gave\r\nsuch a yell that it is a wonder I didn\'t jump out of my skin.  It\r\nfrightened me so that I couldn\'t have moved if I had wanted to,\r\nwhich was a lucky thing for me.  The instant he yelled he cocked\r\nhis head on one side and listened.  That yell must have wakened\r\nsomebody and caused them to move, for Yowler turned suddenly and\r\ncrept swiftly and without a sound out of sight.  A minute later\r\nI heard a jump, and then I heard a fluttering.  I think he caught\r\none of the Grouse family."\r\n\r\n"Yelling that way is one of Yowler\'s tricks," explained Old Mother\r\nNature.  "He does it for the same reason Hooty the Owl hoots.  He\r\nhopes that it will startle some sleeper so that they will move.\r\nIf they do, his keen ears are sure to hear it.  Was that all of\r\nyour adventure, Jumper?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied Jumper.  "I remained right where I was for the rest\r\nof the night.  Just as daylight was beginning to steal through the\r\nGreen Forest, I decided that it was safe to leave my hiding place\r\nand come over here.  Half-way here I stopped for a few minutes in\r\na thick clump of ferns.  I was just about to start on again when I\r\ncaught sight of something moving just back of an old stump.  It\r\nwas that foolish looking tail of Yowler\'s.  Had he kept it still I\r\nwouldn\'t have seen him at all; but he was twitching it back and\r\nforth.  He was crouched down close to the ground with all four\r\nfeet drawn close together under him.  There he crouched, and there\r\nI sat for the longest time.  I didn\'t move, and he didn\'t move,\r\nsave that foolish looking tail of his.  I had begun to think that\r\nI would have to stay in that clump of ferns all day when suddenly\r\nYowler sprang like a flash.  There was a little squeak, and then I\r\nsaw Yowler trot away with a Mouse in his mouth.  I guess he must\r\nhave seen that Mouse go in a hole and knew that if he waited long\r\nenough it would come out again.  As soon as Yowler disappeared I\r\nhurried over here.  That\'s all."\r\n\r\n"That was a splendid account of Yowler and his way of hunting," said\r\nOld Mother Nature.  "He does most of his hunting in just that way,\r\nsneaking about on the chance of surprising a Rabbit, Bird or Mouse,\r\nor else patiently watching and waiting beside a hole in which he\r\nknows some one has taken refuge.  He hunts in the Green Forest\r\nexactly as Black Pussy, Farmer Brown\'s Cat, hunts Mice in the barn\r\nor Birds in the Old Orchard.  In the spring Yowler destroys many\r\neggs and young birds, not only those found in nests on the ground,\r\nbut also those in nests in trees, for he is a splendid climber.\r\n\r\n"Yowler is found in nearly all of the swampy, brushy and wooded\r\nparts of the whole country, excepting in the great forests of the\r\nFar North, where his cousin Tufty the Lynx lives.  Yowler is\r\nhimself a Lynx, the Bay Lynx.  In some places he is called simply\r\nWild Cat.  In others he is called the Catamount.  He is not so\r\nfond of the thick forests as he is of swamps, brush-grown hillsides,\r\nold pastures and places where there are great masses of briars.\r\nRocky ledges where there are caves in which to hide and plenty of\r\nbrush also suit him.  He is a coward, but when cornered will fight,\r\nthough he will run from a little Dog half his size and take to a\r\ntree.  In the South he is quite common and there often steals\r\nChickens and Turkeys, even young Pigs.  He prefers to hunt at\r\nnight, but sometimes is seen in broad daylight.  Mrs. Yowler\'s\r\nkittens are born in a cave or in a hollow tree.  Despite the fact\r\nthat he is an expert climber, Yowler spends most of his time on\r\nthe ground and is one of the worst enemies of Rabbits, Mice,\r\nSquirrels and ground Birds.\r\n\r\n"In the great forests of the Far North lives Yowler\'s cousin, Tufty\r\nthe Canada Lynx, also called Loup Cervier and Lucivee.  He is nearly\r\na third larger than Yowler.  From the tip of each ear long tufts of\r\nblack hair stand up.  On each side of his face is a ruff of long\r\nhair.  His tail is even shorter than Yowler\'s, and the tip of it is\r\nalways wholly black.  His general color is gray, mottled with brown.\r\nHis face ruff is white with black border.  Yowler\'s feet are large,\r\nbut Tufty\'s are immense for his size.  This is because Tufty lives\r\nwhere the snow lies deep for many months, and these big, broad feet\r\nenable him to travel about on the snow without breaking through.  He\r\ncan travel with ease where Reddy Fox, not half his size and weight,\r\nwould break through at every step.  Tufty\'s ways are much like those\r\nof his cousin, Yowler, save that he is a dweller in the deep woods.\r\nAnything he can catch is food for Tufty, but his principal food is the\r\nNorthern Hare.  The color of his coat blends with the shadows so that\r\nhe seems like a living shadow himself.  In summer food is plentiful,\r\nand Tufty lives well, but in winder Tufty has hard work to get enough.\r\nRarely does he know what a full stomach means then.  Like Howler he\r\ncan go a surprising length of time without food and still retain his\r\nstrength.  At that time of year he is a great traveler.  He has to\r\nbe, in order to live.\r\n\r\n"There is no fiercer looking animal in all the Green Forest than\r\nTufty the Lynx, but despite this he is, like most Cats, cowardly.\r\nOnly when cornered will he fight.  He is possessed of a lively\r\ncuriosity, and often he will stealthily follow a hunter or trapper\r\nfor miles.  The fur of his coat is very long and handsome, and he\r\nis hunted and trapped for this.  As he lives for the most part far\r\nfrom the homes of men, he does less damage to man than does his\r\ncousin, Yowler the Bob Cat.  Tufty must depend wholly for his living\r\non the little people of the Green Forest.  Sometimes he will attack\r\na Fox.  The pretty little spotted babies of Lightfoot the Deer are\r\nvictims whenever he can find them.\r\n\r\n"The darker and deeper the Green Forest, the better Tufty likes\r\nit.  He makes his den under great tangles of fallen trees or\r\nsimilar places.  Mr. And Mrs. Tufty often hunt together, and in\r\nearly winter the whole family often join in the hunt.\r\n\r\n"Yowler and Tufty are the only members of the Cat family now found\r\nin the eastern part of the country.  Formerly, their big cousin,\r\nPuma the Panther, lived in the East, but he has been so hunted by\r\nman that now he is found only in the mountains of the Far West and\r\nin a few of the wildest places in the South.  I will tell you about\r\nhim to-morrow."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX  Some Big and Little Cat Cousins\r\n\r\n"Puma the Panther," began Old Mother Nature, "is the largest member\r\nof the Cat family in this country, with the exception of one which is\r\nfound only in the extreme Southwest.  Puma is also called Mountain\r\nLion, Cougar and Painter.  You all know how Black Pussy looks.  If\r\nBlack Pussy could grow to be over eight feet long and be given a\r\nyellowish-brown coat, whitish underneath, she would look very much\r\nlike Puma the Panther.  Unlike Yowler the Bob Cat and Tufty the Lynx,\r\nPuma has a long tail--just such a round tail as Black Pussy has.\r\nBeing so large, Puma is of great strength, and he has all the grace\r\nand quickness in movement of a true Cat.  As I told you yesterday,\r\nthere was a time when Puma lived in the East.  In fact, he was once\r\nin nearly all parts of this great country where there were forests.\r\nBut as the country became settled by man, Puma was driven out, and\r\nnow his home is chiefly in the great mountains of the Far West.\r\n\r\n"Being so big, he must have much food.  Instead of depending for his\r\nliving on small animals and birds, Puma hunts the large animals.  He\r\nis so big and so strong that he can kill Lightfoot the Deer without\r\ntrouble, and there is no one Lightfoot dreads more than Puma.  He is\r\nespecially fond of Horse flesh, and in certain sections where herds\r\nof Horses are pastured, he has killed so many young Horses that he\r\nhas won the undying hate of man.\r\n\r\n"Big as he is, he is a coward and will run from a barking Dog.\r\nWhen desperate with hunger, he has been known to attack man, but\r\nsuch occasions have been very, very rare.  The fact is, he fears\r\nman and will slink sway at his approach.  Like the true Cat that\r\nhe is, he is wonderfully soft-footed and, despite his great size,\r\nmoves silently.  He makes his home among the ledges high up in the\r\nmountains.  At night he goes forth to hunt.  Once in a while he is\r\nseen hunting in daytime, but not often.  Sometimes he may be seen\r\nbasking in the sun, high up on the ledges.  He is a good climber,\r\nlike most Cats.  He never shows himself boldly, but slinks about\r\nthrough the forest and among the rocks, the picture of stealth.\r\nThis habit has won for him another name--that of Sneak Cat.\r\nSometimes he sneaks up on his prey to within jumping distance.\r\nAgain he lies in wait beside a path which certain animals are in\r\nthe habit of using.  He is capable of leaping a long distance, and\r\nwhen he strikes his prey his great weight, added to the force of\r\nhis spring, is almost certain to knock it down, even though it be\r\nmuch bigger than Puma himself.\r\n\r\n"Men hunt him with Dogs, for as I have already told you he will run\r\nfrom a barking Dog.  Usually he doesn\'t run far before taking to a\r\ntree.  The hunters follow and shoot him there.  Were it not that he\r\ncan be hunted in this way with Dogs, he would have little to fear\r\nfrom man, for he is so keen of sight and hearing and can move so\r\nswiftly and silently, that it is rarely man can surprise him.\r\nSometimes he will follow a man just as Tufty the Lynx does, but\r\nusually for the same reason--curiosity.  Despite the fact that he\r\nis a sneak and coward, he is so big and fierce-looking that he is\r\nfeared by most men.  Only those who really know him do not fear him.\r\n\r\n"There is one other member of the Cat family in all this great land\r\nlarger than Puma, and this is Jaguar, also called El Tigre.  He is\r\nfound only in a small part of the extreme Southwest, for he really\r\nbelongs in the hot country to the south of this.  Not only is he\r\nthe largest, but he is the handsomest of all the Cat family.  His\r\ncoat is a beautiful deep yellow, covered with spots and rosettes of\r\nblack.  Beneath he is white with large black spots.  He also has a\r\nfairly long tail.  He is thick and heavy, and is not as long as\r\nPuma, but is stouter and heavier.  He can kill Horses, Mules and\r\nCattle with ease, but of course the principal part of his food\r\nconsists of the wild animals about him.  He is so savage in appearance\r\nthat the mere sight of him always awakens fear.  His method of hunting\r\nis much the same as that of the other members of the Cat family.  Most\r\nof his hunting is done at night.  While Puma the panther sometimes\r\nscreams, Jaguar roars, and it is a very terrifying sound.  All the\r\nlittle people and most of the big ones within hearing shiver when\r\nthey hear it.  Jaguar\'s head is large and he is tremendously strong\r\nin the jaws.  Occasionally Jaguar is all black instead of being\r\nyellow and spotted.\r\n\r\n"In this same part of the great Southwest lives a smaller cousin\r\nnamed Ocelot, often called Tiger Cat.  Ocelot is only a little\r\nbigger than Black Pussy, whom you all know, and in shape is very\r\nlike her.  He also has a lovely coat.  It is yellow, not a deep,\r\nrich yellow like Jaguar\'s, but a light yellow, thickly covered with\r\nblack spots.  On his cheeks and the back of his neck are black lines,\r\nand his tail is ringed with black.  He likes best country where the\r\nbrush is very thick and thorny, for there he can hunt in safety,\r\nwith little fear of being hunted by man.  Because of his smaller\r\nsize, he lives chiefly on small animals, birds and reptiles.  He\r\nsometimes kills and eats big Snakes.  When he happens to live near\r\nman, he robs the Hen roosts just as Yowler does.  In all his ways\r\nhe is like the other members of the Cat family.\r\n\r\n"A neighbor of his in that same country is the queerest looking\r\nmember of the Cat family.  He is called the Jaguarundi Cat or\r\nEyra.  Sometimes he is dressed in dull gray and sometimes in rusty\r\nred.  His body is shaped more like that of Little Joe Otter than\r\nof any one else, and he has short legs and a long tail.  He is a\r\nlittle larger than Little Joe, and his head is rather small and\r\nsomewhat flattened, not so round as the heads of most of the\r\nother members of the Cat family.  He likes to be in the vicinity\r\nof water and is a good swimmer.  Not very much is known by man\r\nabout his habits, but he is a true Cat, and the habits of all\r\nCats are much the same."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI  Bobby Coon Arrives\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature was just about to open school when a slight noise\r\nup the Lone Little Path drew all eyes in that direction.  There,\r\nshuffling down the Lone Little Path, was a queer looking fellow.\r\nNo one needed more than one look at that funny, sharp, black and\r\nwhite face of his to recognize him.\r\n\r\n"Bobby Coon!" shouted Peter Rabbit.  "Are you coming to join our\r\nschool, Bobby?"\r\n\r\nBobby shuffled along a little nearer, then sat up and blinked at\r\nthem sleepily.  No one needed to be told that Bobby had been out\r\nall night.  He rubbed his eyes and yawned.  "Hello, everybody,"\r\nsaid he.  "I wish I felt as bright and lively as all of you look.\r\nI\'d like to join your school, but I\'m afraid if I did I would go\r\nto sleep right in the middle of the lesson.  I ought to have been\r\nhome an hour ago.  So I guess I\'ll have to be excused."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature pointed an accusing finger at Bobby Coon.\r\n"Bobby," said she, "You\'ve been getting in mischief.  Now own up\r\nyou\'ve been stealing some of that sweet, milky corn from Farmer\r\nBrown\'s cornfield."\r\n\r\nBobby Coon hung his head.  "I--I--I don\'t think it was stealing," he\r\nmumbled.  "That corn just grows, and I don\'t see why I shouldn\'t have\r\nmy share of it.  I help myself to other things, so why shouldn\'t I\r\nhelp myself to that?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you why," replied Old Mother Nature.  "Farmer Brown\r\nplanted that corn and took care of it.  If he hadn\'t planted it,\r\nthere wouldn\'t have been any corn there.  That makes it his corn.\r\nIf it grew wild, you would have a perfect right to it.  As it is,\r\nyou haven\'t any right to it at all.  Now take my advice, Bobby, and\r\nkeep away from that cornfield.  If you don\'t, you will get in trouble.\r\nOne of these fine nights Bowser the Hound will find you there and you\r\nwill have to run for your life.  Keep away from temptation."\r\n\r\n"But that corn is so good," sighed Bobby Coon, smacking his lips.\r\n"There is nothing I like better than sweet, milky corn, and if I\r\ndon\'t get it from Farmer Brown\'s cornfield, I can\'t get it at all,\r\nfor it doesn\'t grow wild.  He\'ll never miss the little I take."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature shook her head and looked very grave.  "Bobby,"\r\nsaid she, "that is no excuse at all.  Mark what I say: If you keep\r\non you certainly will get in trouble.  If you would be satisfied\r\nto take just an ear or two, I don\'t believe Farmer Brown would care,\r\nbut you know very well that you spoil many times what you eat.  You\r\nsample one ear, then think that probably the next ear will be better\r\nand sweeter and you try that.  By the time you get through you have\r\nspoiled a lot, and eaten only a little.  I think I\'ll punish you a\r\nlittle myself by keeping you here a while.  If you think you can\'t\r\nkeep awake, just go over and sit down there by Prickly Porky; he\'ll\r\nkeep you awake."\r\n\r\n"I--I think I can keep awake," stammered Bobby and opened his eyes\r\nvery wide as if he were trying to stretch his eyelids so as to make\r\nthem stay open.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll help you by asking you a few questions," replied Old Mother\r\nNature.  "Who is it that people sometimes call you the little\r\ncousin of?"\r\n\r\nBobby grinned. "Buster Bear," said he.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," replied Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Of course, being a Raccoon, you are not a Bear, but you are related\r\nto the Bear family.  I want you all to notice Bobby\'s footprints\r\nover yonder.  You will see that the print of his hind foot shows\r\nthe whole foot, heels and toes, and is a lot like Buster Bear\'s\r\nfootprint on a small scale.  Bobby shuffles along in much the same\r\nway that Buster walks.  No one ever mistakes Bobby Coon for any one\r\nelse.  There is no danger that any one ever will as long as he\r\ncarries that big, bushy tail with its broad black and gray rings.\r\nThere is only one other in all this great country with a tail so\r\nmarked, and that is a relative of Bobby\'s of whom I will tell you\r\nlater.  And there is no other face like Bobby\'s with its black\r\ncheeks.  You will notice that Bobby is rather small around the\r\nshoulders, but is big and heavy around the hips.  That gives him\r\na clumsy look, but he is anything but clumsy.  Despite the fact\r\nthat his legs are not very long Bobby is a very good runner.\r\nHowever, he doesn\'t do any running unless he has to.  Bobby, where\r\nwere you before you went over to Farmer Brown\'s cornfield?"\r\n\r\nOnce more Bobby hung his head.  It was quite clear that Bobby\r\ndidn\'t want to answer that question.  But Old Mother Nature\r\ninsisted, and finally Bobby blurted it out.  "I was up to Farmer\r\nBrown\'s hen house," said he.\r\n\r\n"What for?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Oh, just to look around," replied Bobby.\r\n\r\n"To look around for what?" insisted Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Bobby, "I thought one of those Hens up there might\r\nhave dropped an egg that she didn\'t really care about."\r\n\r\n"Bobby," said Old Mother Nature sternly, "why don\'t you own up\r\nthat you went over there to try to steal eggs?  Or did you think\r\nyou might catch a tender young Chicken?  Where were you night\r\nbefore last?"\r\n\r\n"Over at the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool," replied Bobby\r\npromptly, evidently glad the subject had been changed.\r\n\r\n"Well, you didn\'t find sweet corn or eggs or Chickens over there,\r\ndid you?" said Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"No, but I caught three of the sweetest tasting little fish in a\r\nlittle pool in the Laughing Brook, and I got some of the tenderest\r\nClams I\'ve ever eaten," replied Bobby, smacking his lips.  "I raked\r\nthem out of the mud and opened them.  Down at the Smiling Pool I\r\nhad a lot of fun catching young Frogs.  I certainly do like Frogs.\r\nIt is great sport to catch them, and they are fine eating."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you have had an eye on the beech trees and the wild\r\ngrape-vines," said Old Mother Nature slyly.\r\n\r\nBobby\'s face brightened.  "Indeed I have," said he.  "There will\r\nbe splendid crops of beechnuts and grapes this fall.  My, but\r\nthey will taste good!"\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed.  "There is small danger that you will go\r\nhungry," said she.  "When you can\'t find enough to eat times must\r\nbe very hard indeed.  For the benefit of the others you might add\r\nthat in addition to the things mentioned you eat other fruits,\r\nincluding berries, insects of various kinds, birds when you can\r\ncatch them, Mice, Turtles, in fact almost anything that can be\r\neaten.  You are not at all fussy about the kind of food.  But\r\nyou have one habit in regard to your food which it would be well\r\nif some of these other little folks followed.  Do you know what\r\nit is?"\r\n\r\nBobby shook his head.  "No," said he, "not unless you mean the\r\nhabit I have of washing my food.  If there is any water near,\r\nI always like to take what I am going to eat over to it and wash\r\nit; somehow it tastes better."\r\n\r\n"Just so," replied Old Mother Nature.  "More than once I\'ve seen\r\nyou in the moonlight beside the Laughing Brook washing your food,\r\nand it has always pleased me, for there is nothing like cleanliness\r\nand neatness.  Did you raise a family this year, Bobby?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Coon did.  We had four of the finest youngsters you have ever\r\nseen over in a certain big hollow tree.  They are getting big and\r\nlively now, and go out with their mother every night.  I do hope\r\nthe hunters will leave them alone this fall.  I hate to think of\r\nanything happening to them.  If they can just get through the\r\nhunting season safely, I\'ll enjoy my winter sleep better, and I\r\nknow Mrs. Coon will."\r\n\r\nAt this Johnny Chuck pricked up his ears.  "Do you sleep all\r\nwinter, Bobby?" he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Not all winter, but a good part of it," replied Bobby.  "I don\'t\r\nturn in until the weather gets pretty cold, and it is hard to find\r\nanything to eat.  But after the first snow I\'m usually ready to\r\nsleep.  Then I curl up in a warm bed of leaves in a certain big\r\nhollow tree, and don\'t care how cold or stormy the weather is.\r\nSometimes I wake up once or twice, when the weather is mild, and\r\ntake a little walk around for exercise.  But I don\'t go far and\r\nsoon return to sleep."\r\n\r\n"What do you do when Bowser the Hound gets after you?" asked\r\nPeter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Run till I get out of breath," replied Bobby.  "And if by that time\r\nI haven\'t been able to fool him so that he loses my trail, I take to\r\na tree.  Thank goodness, he can\'t climb a tree.  Sometimes I climb\r\nfrom the top of one tree into the top of another, and sometimes\r\ninto a third and then a fourth, when they are near enough together.\r\nThat fools the hunters, if they follow Bowser."\r\n\r\n"Have you any relatives, Bobby?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know I had until you mentioned that fellow with the ringed\r\ntail you said you would tell us about.  I didn\'t know there was\r\nanybody with a tail like mine, and I would like to know about it,"\r\nreplied Bobby.\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t exactly a Raccoon, but he is more nearly related to you\r\nthan any one else," replied Old Mother Nature.  "His tail shows\r\nthat.  Aside from this, he is nothing like you at all.  He is\r\ncalled the Ring-tailed Cat.  But he doesn\'t look any more like a\r\nCat than he does like you, and he isn\'t related to the Cat family\r\nat all.  He has several names.  He is called the Bassaris, the\r\nCivet Cat, Ring-tailed Cat, Coon Cat and Cacomixtle.  Instead of\r\nbeing thick and clumsy-looking, as is Bobby here, he is long and\r\nrather slender, with a yellowish-brown coat, somewhat grayish on\r\nthe back and whitish underneath.  His head is rather small, long\r\nand beautifully shaped.  His ears are of good size and very pretty.\r\nIn some ways he looks like Reddy Fox.  But the really beautiful\r\nthing about him is his tail.  It is nearly as long as his body,\r\nthick and beautifully marked with black and white bands.\r\n\r\n"He is quick and graceful in his movements, and, like Bobby, prefers\r\nto be abroad at night.  Also, like Bobby, he eats about everything\r\nthat he can find--flesh, reptiles, fruit, nuts and insects.  He\r\nlives in the Far Southwest, and also in some of the mountains of\r\nthe Far West.  Why he should be called Civet Cat is more than I can\r\nguess, for he is neither a Civet nor a Cat.  He is very clever at\r\ncatching Mice, and sometimes he is kept as a pet, just as Farmer\r\nBrown keeps Black Pussy, to catch the Mice about the homes of men.\r\n\r\n"Now, Bobby, you can trot along home, and I hope all that green\r\ncorn you have eaten will not give you the stomach ache.  To-morrow\r\nwe will see what we can find out about Buster Bear."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII  Buster Bear Nearly Breaks Up School\r\n\r\n"Has Buster Bear a tail?" asked Old Mother Nature, and her\r\neyes twinkled.\r\n\r\n"No," declared Whitefoot the Wood Mouse promptly.\r\n\r\n"Yes," contradicted Chatterer the Red Squirrel.\r\n\r\n"What do you say, Prickly Porky?" Old Mother Nature asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he has any; if he has, I\'ve never seen it," said\r\nPrickly Porky.\r\n\r\n"That\'s because you\'ve got poor eyes," spoke up Jumper the Hare.\r\n"He certainly has a tail.  It isn\'t much of a one, but it is a\r\ntail.  I know because I\'ve seen it many times."\r\n\r\n"Woof, woof," said a deep, rumbly, grumbly voice.  "What\'s going\r\non here?  Who is it hasn\'t any tail?"\r\n\r\nAt the sound of that deep, rumbly, grumbly voice it looked for a\r\nfew minutes as if school would be broken up for that day.  There\r\nwas the same mad scrambling to get away that there had been the\r\nmorning Reddy Fox unexpectedly appeared.  However, there was this\r\ndifference: When Reddy appeared, most of the little people sought\r\nsafe hiding places, but now they merely ran to safe distances,\r\nand there turned to stare with awe and great respect at the owner\r\nof that deep, rumbly, grumbly voice.  It was great, big Buster\r\nBear himself.\r\n\r\nBuster stood up on his hind legs, like a man, and his small eyes,\r\nfor they are small for his size, twinkled with fun as he looked\r\naround that awe filled circle.  "Don\'t let me interrupt," said\r\nhe.  "I heard about this school and I thought I would just pay a\r\nfriendly visit.  There is nothing for you to fear.  I have just\r\nhad my breakfast and I couldn\'t eat another mouthful to save me,\r\nnot even such a tender morsel as Whitefoot the Wood Mouse."\r\n\r\nWhitefoot hurriedly ran a little farther away, and Buster Bear\r\nchuckled.  Then he looked over at Old Mother Nature.  "Won\'t you\r\ntell them that I\'m the best-natured and most harmless fellow in\r\nall the Great World?" he asked.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled.  "That depends on the condition of your\r\nstomach," said she.  "If it is as full as you say it is, and I know\r\nyou wouldn\'t tell me an untruth, not even timid Whitefoot has\r\nanything to fear from you."  Then she told all the little people\r\nto put aside their fears and return.\r\n\r\nBuster, seeing that some of the more timid were still fearful,\r\nbacked off a short distance and sat down on his haunches.  "What\r\nwas that about a tail I overheard as I came up?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"It was a little discussion as to whether or not you have a tail,"\r\nreplied Old Mother Nature.  "Some say you have, and some say you\r\nhaven\'t.  Whitefoot thinks you haven\'t."\r\n\r\nOnce more Buster Bear chuckled way down deep in his throat.\r\n"Whitefoot never in his life looked at me long enough to know\r\nwhether I\'ve got a tail or not," said he.  "I never yet have\r\nseen him until now, when he wasn\'t running away as fast as his\r\nlegs could take him.  So with me always behind him, how could he\r\ntell whether or not I have a tail?"\r\n\r\n"Well, have you?" demanded Peter Rabbit bluntly.\r\n\r\n"What do you think?" asked Buster.\r\n\r\n"I think you have," said Peter.  "But if you have you are sitting\r\ndown on it and I can\'t tell.  It can\'t be much of a one, anyhow."\r\n\r\nAgain Buster chuckled.  "Quite right, Peter; quite right," said\r\nhe.  "I\'ve got a tail, but hardly enough of a one to really call\r\nit a tail."\r\n\r\nAs Buster sat there, every one had a splendid chance to see just\r\nhow he looked.  His coat was all black; in fact he was black all\r\nover, with the exception of his nose, which was brown.  His fur\r\nwas long and rather shaggy.  His ears were round.  His paws were\r\nbig and armed with strong, wicked looking claws.\r\n\r\n"You all see what a black coat Buster has," said Old Mother Nature.\r\n"Now I\'m going to tell you something which may surprise you.  Just\r\nas there are Red Foxes that are black, so there are Black Bears\r\nthat are brown."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" grunted Buster, with the funniest look of surprise\r\non his face.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a fact, Buster," said Old Mother Nature.  "A great many of\r\nyour family live out in the mountains of the Far West, and there\r\nquite often there will be one who is all brown.  People used to\r\nthink that these brown Bears were a different kind of Bear, and\r\ncalled them Cinnamon Bears.  It was a long, long time before it\r\nwas found out that those brown Bears are really black Bears.\r\nSometimes one of the twin babies will be all black and the other\r\nall brown.  Sometimes one of Buster\'s family will have a white\r\nspot on his breast.  Buster\'s branch of the family is found in\r\nnearly all of the wooded parts of the entire country.  In the\r\nSunny South they live in the swamps and do not grow as big as in\r\nthe North.  Buster, there is a soft spot on the ground; I want\r\nyou to walk across it so that these little folks can see your\r\nfootprints."\r\n\r\nGood-naturedly Buster dropped on all fours and walked across the\r\nsoft spot.  Right away every one understood why Old Mother Nature\r\nhad asked Buster to do this.  The prints of his hind feet were\r\nvery like the prints of Farmer Brown\'s boy when barefooted, only\r\nof course very much larger.  You see, they showed the print of\r\nthe heel as well as the rest of the foot.\r\n\r\n"You see," said Old Mother Nature, "Buster puts his whole foot on\r\nthe ground, while all members of the Dog and Cat families walk\r\nwholly on their toes.  Animals that put the whole foot down are\r\ncalled plantigrade.  How big do you think Buster was when he\r\nwas born?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'m only guessing," said Chatterer the Red Squirrel,\r\n"but he is such a big fellow that I think he must have been a\r\nbouncing big baby."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature smiled.  "I don\'t wonder you think so," said she.\r\n"The fact is, however, Buster was a very tiny and very helpless\r\nlittle chap.  He was just about the size of one of Prickly Porky\'s\r\nbabies.  He was no bigger than a Rat.  He was born in the middle of\r\nwinter and didn\'t get his eyes open for forty days.  It was two\r\nmonths before he poked his head outside the den in which he was\r\nborn, to find out what the Great World was like.  At that time he\r\nwasn\'t much bigger than Peter Rabbit, and he and his twin sister\r\nwere as lively a pair of youngsters and as full of mischief as\r\nany Bears the Green Forest has ever seen.  You might tell us,\r\nBuster, what you live on."\r\n\r\nBuster\'s eyes snapped. "I live on anything I can eat, and I can\r\neat most everything.  I suppose a lot of people think I live\r\nalmost wholly on the little people who are my neighbors, but that\r\nis a mistake.  I do catch Mice when I am lucky enough to find them\r\nwhere I can dig them out, and they certainly are good eating."\r\n\r\nAt this Whitefoot the Wood Mouse and Danny Meadow Mouse hastily\r\nscurried farther away, and Buster\'s eyes twinkled with mischief.\r\n"Of course I don\'t mind a Rabbit either, if I am lucky enough to\r\ncatch one," said he, and Peter Rabbit quickly backed off a few\r\nsteps.  "In fact I like meat of any kind," continued Buster.  "But\r\nthe greater part of my food isn\'t meat at all.  In the spring I\r\ndig up roots of different kinds, and eat tender grass shoots and\r\nsome bark and twigs from young trees.  When the insects appear\r\nthey help out wonderfully.  I am very fond of Ants.  I pull over\r\nall the old logs and tear to pieces all the old stumps I can find,\r\nand lick up the Ants and their eggs that I am almost sure to find\r\nthere.  Almost any kind of insect tastes good to me if there are\r\nenough of them.  I love to find and dig open the nests of Wasps\r\nthat make their homes in the ground, and of course I suppose you\r\nall know that there is nothing in the world I like better than\r\nhoney.  If I can find a Bee nest I am utterly happy.  For the sake\r\nof the honey, I am perfectly willing to stand all the stinging the\r\nBees can give me.  I like fish and I love to hunt Frogs.  When the\r\nberry season begins, I just feast.  In the fall I get fat on\r\nbeechnuts and acorns.  The fact is, there isn\'t much I don\'t like."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been told you sleep all winter," said Johnny Chuck.\r\n\r\n"That depends on the winter," replied Buster Bear.  "I don\'t go to\r\nsleep until I have to.  I don\'t have to as long as I can find\r\nenough to eat.  If the winter begins early, with bad weather, I\r\nmake a comfortable bed of leaves in a cave or under a big pile\r\nof fallen trees or even in a hollow log, if I can find one big\r\nenough.  Then I go to sleep for the rest of the winter.  But if\r\nthe winter is mild and open and there is a chance of finding\r\nanything to eat, I sleep only in the really bad weather."\r\n\r\n"Do you try to get fat before going to sleep, the way I do?" asked\r\nJohnny Chuck.\r\n\r\nBuster grinned.  "Yes, Johnny, I try," said he, "and usually I\r\nsucceed.  You see, I need to be fat in order to keep warm and also\r\nto have something to live on in the spring, just the same as you do.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been told that you can climb, but as I don\'t live in the Green\r\nForest I have never seen you climb.  I should think it would be slow\r\nwork for such a big fellow as you to climb a tree," said Johnny Chuck.\r\n\r\nBuster looked up at Happy Jack Squirrel and winked.  Then he walked\r\nover to the tree in which Happy Jack was sitting, stood up and\r\nsuddenly began to scramble up the tree.  There was nothing slow\r\nabout the way Buster Bear went up that tree.  Happy Jack squealed\r\nwith sudden fright and started for the top of that tree as only\r\nHappy Jack can climb.  Then he made a flying jump to the next tree.\r\nHalfway up Buster stopped.  Then he began to come down.  He came\r\ndown tail first.  When he was within ten feet of the ground he\r\nsimply let go and dropped.\r\n\r\n"I did that just to show you how I get out of a tree when I am\r\nreally in a hurry," explained Buster.  "I don\'t climb trees much\r\nnow unless it is for honey, but when I was a little fellow I used\r\nto love to climb trees."\r\n\r\nSuddenly Buster sat up very straight and pointed his nose up in\r\nthe wind.  An anxious look crept into his face.  He cocked his ears\r\nas if listening with all his might.  That is just what he was doing.\r\nPresently he dropped down to all fours.  "Excuse me," said he, "I\r\nthink I had better be going.  Farmer Brown is coming down the Lone\r\nLittle Path."\r\n\r\nBuster turned and disappeared at a speed that was simply astonishing\r\nin such a clumsy-looking fellow.  Old Mother Nature laughed.\r\n"Buster\'s eyes are not very good," said she, "but there is nothing\r\nthe matter with his nose or with his ears.  If Buster says that\r\nFarmer Brown is coming down the Lone Little Path, there is no doubt\r\nthat he is, although he may be some distance away yet.  Buster has\r\nbeen smart enough to learn that he has every reason to fear man,\r\nand he promptly takes himself out of the way at the first hint that\r\nman is near.  It is a funny thing, but most men are as afraid of\r\nBuster as Buster is of them, and they haven\'t the least need of\r\nbeing afraid at all.  Where man is concerned there isn\'t one of\r\nyou little people more timid than Buster Bear.  The faintest smell\r\nof man will make him run.  If he should be wounded or cornered, he\r\nwould fight.  Mrs. Bear would fight to protect her babies, but these\r\nare the only conditions under which a Black Bear will face a man.\r\nYou think Buster is big, and he is, but Buster has relatives very\r\nmuch bigger than he.  He has one beside whom he would look actually\r\nsmall.  I\'ll tell you a little about these cousins of Buster."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII  Buster Bear\'s Big Cousins\r\n\r\nBuster Bear had been right about the coming of Farmer Brown.  It\r\nwas only a few minutes after Buster\'s disappearance that Farmer\r\nBrown\'s footsteps were heard coming down the Lone Little Path,\r\nand of course that ended school for that morning.  But the next\r\nmorning all were on hand again at sun-up, for every one wanted to\r\nhear about Buster Bear\'s big cousins.\r\n\r\n"Way out in the mountains of the Far West, where Whistler the\r\nMarmot and Little Chief the Pika live, is a big cousin of Buster\r\nBear," began Old Mother Nature.  "He is Silvertip the Grizzly\r\nBear, and in the past no animal in all this great country was so\r\nfeared by man, as he.  But times have changed, and Silvertip has\r\nbeen so hunted with terrible guns that he has learned to fear man\r\nquite as much as Buster does.\r\n\r\n"He is larger than Buster and possessed of tremendous strength.\r\nInstead of a black coat, he has a coat which varies from\r\nyellowish-brown to almost black.  The tips of the hairs usually are\r\nlighter, giving him a frosted appearance, and this is what has given him\r\nhis name.  His claws are longer and more curved than those of Buster; in\r\nfact those claws are so big that they look very terrible. Because they\r\nare so long, Silvertip cannot climb trees.  But if they prevent him\r\nclimbing trees they are the finest kind of tools for digging out Marmots\r\nand ground Squirrels.  Even when Whistler the Marmot makes his home down\r\nin among the rocks, he is not safe. Silvertip\'s strength is so great\r\nthat he can pull over and roll aside great rocks.\r\n\r\n"He is a great traveler and covers a wide range of country in his\r\nsearch for food.  Sometimes he visits the Cattle ranges and kills\r\nCattle.  So great is his strength that he can kill a Cow with ease.\r\nClumsy looking as he is, he is a very fast runner, and only a fast\r\nHorse can outrun him.  Like Buster, he lives on anything he can\r\nfind that is eatable.  He has been so hunted by man that he has\r\nbecome very cunning, and in all the great mountains where he lives\r\nthere is no one with quicker wits.  At certain seasons of the year\r\ngreat numbers of a fish called Salmon come up the rivers in that\r\ncountry, and then Silvertip lives high.  He watches beside a pool\r\nuntil a Salmon swims within reach; then, with a swift movement of\r\none paw, he scoops the fish on to the bank.  Or he finds a place\r\nwhere the water is so shallow that the fish have difficulty in\r\ngetting across, and there he seizes them as they struggle up the\r\nriver.  In winter he sleeps just as Buster does, usually in a\r\nwell-hidden cave.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Silvertip is a splendid mother.  Usually the cubs, of which\r\nas a rule there are two, remain with her until they are a year old.\r\nBoth Buster Bear and Silvertip have a queer habit of standing up\r\nagainst a tree and biting it as high up as they can reach.  The\r\nnext Bear who comes along that way sees the mark and makes his\r\nown on the same tree.  Silvertip knows every inch of that part of\r\nthe country in which he lives and always picks out the best way\r\nof getting from one place to another.  He is one of the finest\r\nanimals in this country, and it is a matter for sadness that his\r\nsplendid race will soon come to an end unless man makes laws to\r\nprotect him from the hunters.  In very many places where he used\r\nto be found he lives no longer.\r\n\r\n"Silvertip is not so good-natured as Buster, but all he asks is\r\nto be left alone.  Of course when he turns Cattle killer he is\r\ngetting into the worst possible kind of mischief and man cannot\r\nbe blamed for hunting him.  But it is only now and then that one\r\nof Silvertip\'s family turns Cattle killer.  The others do no harm.\r\n\r\n"I told you yesterday that Buster Bear has one cousin beside whom\r\nhe would look small.  This is Bigfoot the Alaska or Great Brown\r\nBear, who lives in the extreme northwest part of the continent.\r\nEven Silvertip would look small beside him.  He is a giant, the\r\nlargest flesh-eating animal in all the great world.  His coat is\r\ndark brown.  When he stands up on his hind legs, he is almost half\r\nagain as tall as a tall man.  He stands very high at the shoulders\r\nand his head is very large.  Like the other members of the Bear\r\nfamily, he eats all sorts of things.  He hunts for Mice and other\r\nsmall animals, digs up roots, stuffs himself with berries, and at\r\ntimes grazes on a kind of wild grass, just as Cattle might do.  He\r\nis a great fish eater, for fish are very plentiful in the streams\r\nin the country where he lives.  Big as he is, he has learned to\r\nfear man just as Silvertip has.  Occasionally when surprised he\r\nhas been known to attack man and kill him, but as a rule he will\r\nrun at the first hint of man\'s approach.\r\n\r\n"The last of the Bear cousins is Snow King the Polar Bear.  Snow\r\nKing is king of the Frozen North.  He lives in the region of snow\r\nand ice, and his coat is all white.  He also is a big Bear, and of\r\nsomewhat different shape from his cousins.  He is longer, and has\r\na much longer neck and a long head.  His ears are rather small and\r\nclose to his head.  Snow King lives the year round where it would\r\nseem that no animal could live, and he manages to live well.\r\nThough his home is in the coldest part of the Great World, he does\r\nnot mind the cold at all.\r\n\r\n"More than any other member of the Bear family, Snow King is a\r\nflesh eater.  This is because only in certain places, and then only\r\nfor a few weeks in midsummer, is there any plant life.  He is a\r\ngreat fisherman, and fish furnish him a great deal of his food.  In\r\nthat far northern country are great numbers of animals who live in\r\nthe ocean, but come ashore to rest and bask in the sun, and to have\r\ntheir babies there.  They are Seals, Sea Lions and Walruses.  I will\r\ntell you about them later.  On these Snow King depends for much of\r\nhis food.  He is himself a wonderful swimmer, and often swims far\r\nout in the icy water.\r\n\r\n"Up there there are great fields of floating ice, and Snow King\r\nswims from one to another in search of Seals, for they often\r\nclimb out on these ice fields, just as they do on shore.\r\nSometimes Mrs. Bear takes her cubs for long swims.  When they\r\nbecome tired, one will climb on her back, and the other will\r\nseize her tail, so she will carry one and tow the other.\r\n\r\n"Snow King\'s babies are born in a house of snow.  Early in the\r\nwinter Mrs. Bear finds a sheltered place where the snow will drift\r\nover her.  There she goes to sleep, and the snow drifts and drifts\r\nover her until she is buried deep.  You might think she would be\r\ncold, but she isn\'t, for the snow keeps her warm.  Her breath melts\r\na little hole up through the snow, so that she always has air.\r\nThere the babies are born, and there they remain, just as Buster\r\nBear\'s remain in their home, until they are big enough to follow\r\ntheir mother about.  Then she breaks her way out in the spring, and\r\nleads her cubs forth to teach them how to take care of themselves.\r\nSnow King, himself, does not sleep through the winter, but roams\r\nabout, just as in the summer.\r\n\r\n"Snow King is fearless and has not yet learned to dread man, as\r\nhave his cousins.  He will not hesitate to attack man and is\r\nterrible to meet at close quarters.  Because he lives in that far,\r\ncold country, he is not hunted as much as other bears are.  Besides\r\nthe Seals and fish, he sometimes catches an Arctic Hare.  In the\r\nsummer great numbers of Ducks and other sea birds nest in that\r\nfar northern country, and their eggs and young add to Snow King\'s\r\nbill of fare.  His white coat is so in keeping with his surroundings\r\nthat it is of the greatest aid to him in his hunting.  It is a\r\nvery beautiful coat and makes him the most beautiful of all the\r\nBear family.\r\n\r\n"Now this is all about the Bears, and also it is all about the order\r\nof flesh eaters, or Carnivora.  I think that next we will see what\r\nwe can find out about a certain little friend of yours, who, though\r\nhe eats flesh, is not a member of the flesh-eating order at all, but\r\nbelongs to an order of which he is the only member in this country.\r\nI will leave you to guess who it is."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV  Unc\' Billy and Old Mrs. Possum\r\n\r\nAll the way home from school Peter Rabbit did his best to think who\r\nit could be who ate flesh, yet wasn\'t a member of the order of\r\nflesh eaters.  Every few hops he would stop to think, but all his\r\nstopping and all his thinking were in vain, and when he started\r\nfor school the next morning he was as puzzled as ever.  On his way\r\nthrough the Green Forest he passed a certain tree.  He was just\r\npast and no more when a familiar voice hailed him.\r\n\r\n"Morning, Bre\'r Rabbit," said the voice.  "What\'s yo\' hurry?"  Peter\r\nstopped abruptly and looked up in that tree.  There, peering down at\r\nhim from a hole high up in the trunk, was a sharp, whitish-gray face,\r\nwith a pair of twinkling black eyes.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Unc\' Billy," cried Peter.  "How are you and Ol\' Mrs. Possum?"\r\n\r\n"Po\'ly, Peter, Po\'ly.  We-uns haven\'t had breakfast yet, so we-uns\r\nare feeling po\'ly," replied Unc\' Billy with a grin.\r\n\r\nA sudden thought popped into Peter\'s head.  "Unc\' Billy," cried\r\nPeter excitedly, "are you a Carnivora?"\r\n\r\nUnc\' poked his head a little farther out and put his hand behind\r\nhis ear as if he were a little hard of hearing.  "What\'s that,\r\nBre\'r Rabbit?  Am I a what?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Are you a Carnivora?" repeated Peter.\r\n\r\n"Ah reckons Ah might be if Ah knew what it was, but as long as Ah\r\ndon\'t, Ah reckons I ain\'t," retorted Unc\' Billy.  "Ah reckons Ah\'m\r\njust plain Possum.  When Ah wants to be real uppity, Ah puts on an\r\n\'o.\'  Then Ah am Mister Opossum."\r\n\r\nBut Peter wasn\'t listening.  The fact is, Peter had started\r\nlipperty-lipperty-lip for school, without even being polite enough\r\nto say good-by.  He arrived at school quite out of breath.  "I\r\nknow!" he panted.  "I know!"\r\n\r\n"What do you know?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"I know who it is who eats flesh, yet doesn\'t belong to the order\r\nof flesh eaters.  It\'s Unc\' Billy Possum!" cried Peter.\r\n\r\n"Right you are," replied Old Mother Nature.  "However did you find\r\nit out?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t exactly find it out; I guessed it," replied Peter.  "On\r\nmy way here I saw Unc\' Billy, and it popped into my head right\r\naway that he was one we haven\'t heard about, and must be the one.\r\nBut if he eats flesh, I don\'t see why he isn\'t a member of the\r\norder of flesh eaters."\r\n\r\n"It is because he belongs to a group which has something which\r\nmakes them entirely different from all other animals, and for\r\nthis reason they have been given an order of their own," explained\r\nOld Mother Nature.  "They belong to the order of Marsupials,\r\nwhich means pouched animals.  It is because the mothers have big\r\npockets in which they carry their babies.  Old Mrs. Possum has\r\njust such a pocket."\r\n\r\n"Of course," exclaimed Peter.  "I\'ve seen those babies poking\r\ntheir heads out of that pocket.  They look too funny for anything."\r\n\r\n"The Opossums are the only Marsupials in this country," continued\r\nOld Mother Nature.  "Now have I made it quite clear why, although\r\nthey eat flesh, Unc\' Billy and Ol\' Mrs. Possum are not members of\r\nthe same big order as Buster Bear and the other flesh eaters?"\r\n\r\nEverybody nodded.  Just then Chatterer the Red Squirrel shouted,\r\n"Here comes Unc\' Billy, Ol\' Mrs. Possum and all the little Possums."\r\n\r\nSure enough, down the Lone Little Path came the Possum family, and\r\na funny looking sight they were.  Unc\' Billy was whitish-gray, his\r\nface whiter than the rest of him.  He looked as if he had just\r\ngotten out of bed and forgotten to brush his hair; it pointed every\r\nwhich way.  His legs were dark, his feet black and his toes white.\r\nHis ears were without any hair at all, and were black for the lower\r\nhalf, the rest being white.  He had a long whitish tail without any\r\nhair on it.  Altogether, with his sharp face and naked tail, he\r\nlooked a great deal as though he might be a giant Rat.\r\n\r\nBut if Unc\' Billy was a funny-looking fellow, Ol\' Mrs. Possum was\r\neven more funny-looking.  She seemed to have heads and tails all\r\nover her.  You see, she had brought along her family, and Ol\' Mrs.\r\nPossum is one of those who believe in large families.  There were\r\ntwelve youngsters, and they were exactly like their parents, only\r\nsmall.  They were clinging all over Ol\' Mrs. Possum.  Some were on\r\nher back, some were clinging to her sides, and a couple were in\r\nthe big pocket, where they had spent their babyhood.\r\n\r\n"We--all done thought we\'d come to school," explained Unc\' Billy\r\nwith a grin.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you did," replied Old Mother Nature.  "You see, the rest\r\nof your friends here are a little curious about the Possum family."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ol\' Mrs. Possum was climbing a tree, and when she had\r\nreached a comfortable crotch the little Possums left her and began\r\nto play about in the tree.  It was then that it appeared what handy\r\nthings those naked little tails were.  When the little Possums\r\ncrawled out where the branches were small, they simply wrapped\r\ntheir tails around the twigs to keep from falling.\r\n\r\n"My!" exclaimed Peter.  "Those certainly are handy tails."\r\n\r\n"Handiest tails ever was," declared Unc\' Billy.  "Don\'t know what\r\nAh ever would do without mah tail."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you climb a tree, Unc\' Billy, and show your friends here\r\nhow you manage to get the eggs from a nest that you cannot reach\r\nby crawling along the branch on which it is placed," said Old\r\nMother Nature.\r\n\r\nUnc\' Billy grinned, and good-naturedly started up a tree.  He crept\r\nout on a branch that overhung another branch.  Way out where the\r\nbranch was small crept Unc\' Billy.  Then he wrapped the end of his\r\ntail around the branch and swung himself off, keeping hold of the\r\nbranch only with his tail and one hind foot. Then, stretching down\r\nfull length, he could just reach the branch below him. "You see,"\r\nhe explained, "if there was a nest on this branch down here, Ah\r\ncould get those eggs without any trouble.  Ah wish there was a\r\nnest.  Just speaking of eggs makes mah mouth water."  Again Unc\'\r\nBilly grinned and then pulled himself back to the other branch.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature shook her head reprovingly.  "Unc\' Billy," said\r\nshe, "you are a bad old rascal to steal eggs.  What\'s more, it\r\ndoesn\'t matter to you much whether you find eggs or young birds\r\nin a nest.  It is a wonder that between you and Chatterer the Red\r\nSquirrel any of the birds succeed in raising families around\r\nhere.  Have you visited Farmer Brown\'s hen house lately?"\r\n\r\nUnc\' Billy shook his head.  "Not lately," said he; "Ah done got\r\na dreadful scare the last time Ah was up there, and Ah reckons\r\nAh\'ll stay away from there for a while."\r\n\r\n"What else do you eat?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Anything," replied Unc\' Billy.  "Ah reckons Ah ain\'t no ways\r\nparticular--insects, roots, Frogs, Toads, small Snakes, Lizards,\r\nberries, fruits, nuts, young Rats and Mice, corn, any old meat\r\nthat has been left lying around.  Ah reckon Ah could find a meal\r\nmost any time most anywhere."\r\n\r\n"Do you always have as big a family as you have there?" asked\r\nPeter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Not always," replied Unc\' Billy.  "But sometimes Mrs. Possum\r\nhas to tote around a still bigger family. We believe in chillun\r\nand lots of them. We reckon on havin\' two or three big families\r\nevery year."\r\n\r\n"Where is your home?" asked Johnny Chuck.  "I know," said Peter\r\nRabbit.  "It\'s up in a big hollow tree."\r\n\r\nUnc\' Billy looked down at Peter.  "\'Tisn\'t at all necessary to\r\ntell anybody where that hollow tree is, Bre\'r Rabbit," said he.\r\n\r\n"Are Possums found anywhere except around here?" inquired\r\nHappy Jack.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," replied Old Mother Nature.  "They are found all down\r\nthrough the Sunny South, and in the warmer parts of the Middle West.\r\nUnc\' Billy and his relatives are not fond of cold weather.  They\r\nprefer to be where they can be reasonably warm all the year round.\r\n\r\n"Some folks think Unc\' Billy isn\'t smart, but those folks don\'t\r\nknow Unc\' Billy.  He learned a long time ago that he can\'t run as\r\nfast as some others, so he has learned to depend on his wits in\r\ntime of danger.  What do you think he does?"\r\n\r\n"I know," cried Peter; "I saw him do it once.  Farmer Brown\'s boy\r\nsurprised Unc\' Billy, and Unc\' Billy just fell right over dead."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!  That\'s a story, Peter Rabbit.  How could Unc\' Billy have\r\nfallen over dead and be alive up in that tree this very minute?"\r\ncried Happy Jack.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean he was really dead, but that he looked as if he\r\nwere dead," explained Peter.  "And he did, too.  He was the deadest\r\nlooking thing I ever saw.  I thought he was dead myself.  I was\r\nwatching from a bramble tangle where I was hiding, and I certainly\r\nthought the life had been scared right out of Unc\' Billy.  I guess\r\nFarmer Brown\'s boy thought so too.  He picked Unc\' Billy up by the\r\ntail, and looked him all over, and said, \'You poor little thing. I\r\ndidn\'t mean to hurt you.\'  Unc\' Billy didn\'t so much as wink an eye.\r\nFarmer Brown\'s boy went off up the path carrying Unc\' Billy by the\r\ntail.  By and by he laid Unc\' Billy down on an old stump while he\r\nwent to look at a nest of Blacky the Crow.  When he came back Unc\'\r\nBilly wasn\'t there.  I never did see Unc\' Billy hurry as he did\r\nthe minute Farmer Brown\'s boy\'s back was turned.  He came to life\r\nas suddenly as he had dropped dead."\r\n\r\n"Very good, Peter," said Old Mother Nature.  "Some other smart\r\nlittle people try that trick sometimes, but none of them can do\r\nit as well as Unc\' Billy Possum.  Pretending to be dead in order\r\nto remain alive is the cleverest thing Unc\' Billy does.  Now how\r\nabout Lightfoot the Deer for the next lesson?"\r\n\r\n"Splendid," cried all together and prepared to start for their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV  Lightfoot, Blacktail and Forkhorn\r\n\r\nOf all the people who live in the Green Forest none is more admired\r\nthan Lightfoot the Deer.  So perhaps you can guess how delighted\r\nevery one was when, just as the morning lesson was to begin,\r\nLightfoot himself stepped daintily out from a thicket and bowed\r\nto Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"I heard," said he, "that my little friends here are to learn\r\nsomething about my family this morning, and thought you would not\r\nmind if I joined them."\r\n\r\n"I should say not!" exclaimed Peter Rabbit forgetting that Lightfoot\r\nhad spoken to Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nAll laughed, even Old Mother Nature.  You see, Peter was so very\r\nmuch in earnest, and at the same time so excited, that it really\r\nwas funny.\r\n\r\n"Peter has spoken for all of us," said Old Mother Nature.  "You\r\nare more than welcome, Lightfoot.  I had intended to send for you,\r\nbut it slipped my mind.  I am delighted to have you here and I know\r\nthat the others are.  I suspect you will be most comfortable if you\r\nlie down, but before you do this I want everybody to have a good\r\nlook at you.  Just stand for a few minutes in that little open\r\nspace where all can see you."\r\n\r\nLightfoot walked over to the open space where the sun fell full on\r\nhim and there he stood, a picture of grace and beauty with just\r\nenough honest pride in his appearance to give him an air of noble\r\ndignity.  There was more than one little gasp of admiration among\r\nhis little neighbors.\r\n\r\n"There," began Old Mother Nature, "is one of the most beautiful\r\nof all my children, and the knowledge that he is beautiful does\r\nnot spoil him.  Lightfoot belongs to the Deer family, as you all\r\nknow, and this in turn is in the order called Ungulata, which\r\nmeans hoofed."\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit abruptly sat up, and his ears stood up like exclamation\r\npoints.  "Farmer Brown\'s cows have those funny feet called hoofs;\r\nare they related to Lightfoot?" he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n"They belong to another family, but it is in the same order.  So\r\nthey are distant cousins of Lightfoot," replied Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"And Farmer Brown\'s Pigs, what about them?" asked Chatterer the\r\nRed Squirrel.  "They also belong to that order and so are related,"\r\nexplained Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"Huh!" exclaimed Chatterer.  "If I were in Lightfoot\'s place I\r\nnever, never would acknowledge any such homely, stupid creatures\r\nas those as relatives of mine."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t forget that Prickly Porky the Porcupine and Robber the Rat\r\nare members of the same order to which you belong," retorted Old\r\nMother Nature softly, and Chatterer hung his head.  "Lightfoot,"\r\nshe continued, "is the White-tailed or Virginia Deer, and is in\r\nsome ways the most beautiful of the Deer family.  You have only to\r\nlook at him to know that those slim legs of his are meant for speed.\r\nHe can go very fast, but not for long distances without stopping.\r\nLike Peter Rabbit he is a jumper rather than a true runner, and\r\ntravels with low bounds with occasional high ones when alarmed.\r\nHe can make very long and high jumps, and this is one reason he\r\nprefers to live in the Green Forest where there are fallen trees\r\nand tangles of old logs.  If frightened he can leap over them,\r\nwhereas his enemies must crawl under or climb over or go around\r\nthem.  Ordinary fences, such as Farmer Brown has built around his\r\nfields, do not bother Lightfoot in the least.  He can leap over\r\nthem as easily as Peter Rabbit can jump over that little log he\r\nis sitting beside.\r\n\r\n"Just now, because it is summer, Lightfoot\'s coat is decidedly\r\nreddish in color and very handsome.  But in winter it is wholly\r\ndifferent."\r\n\r\n"I know," spoke up Chatterer the Red Squirrel.  "It is gray then.\r\nI\'ve often seen Lightfoot in winter, and there isn\'t a red hair\r\non him at that season.\r\n\r\n"Quite right," agreed Old Mother Nature.  "His red coat is for\r\nsummer only.  Notice that Lightfoot has a black nose.  That is, the\r\ntip of it is black.  Beneath his chin is a black spot.  A band\r\nacross his nose, the inside of each ear and a circle around each\r\neye is whitish.  His throat is white and he is white beneath.  Now,\r\nPeter, you are so interested in tails, tell me without looking\r\nwhat color Lightfoot\'s tail is."\r\n\r\n"White, snowy white," replied Peter promptly.  "I suppose that is\r\nwhy he is called the White-tailed Deer."\r\n\r\n"Huh!" grunted Johnny Chuck who happened to be sitting a little\r\nback of Lightfoot, "I don\'t call it white.  It has a white edge,\r\nbut mostly it is the color of his coat."\r\n\r\nNow while Lightfoot had been standing there his tail had hung down,\r\nand it was as Johnny Chuck had said.  But at Johnny\'s remark up flew\r\nLightfoot\'s tail, showing only the under side.  It was like a pointed\r\nwhite flag.  With it held aloft that way, no one behind Lightfoot\r\nwould suspect that his whole tail was not white.\r\n\r\n"Notice how long and fluffy the hair on that tail is," said Old\r\nMother Nature.  "Mrs. Lightfoot\'s is just like it, and this makes\r\nit very easy for her babies to follow her in the dark.  When\r\nLightfoot is feeding or simply walking about he carries it down,\r\nbut when he is frightened and bounds away, up goes that white\r\nflag.  Now look at his horns.  They are not true horns.  The\r\nlatter are hollow, while these are not.  Farmer Brown\'s cows have\r\nhorns.  Lightfoot has antlers.  Just remember that.  The so-called\r\nhorns of all the Deer family are antlers and are not hollow.\r\nNotice how Lightfoot\'s curve forward with the branches or tines\r\non the back side."\r\n\r\nOf course everybody looked at Lightfoot\'s crown as he held his head\r\nproudly.  "What is the matter with them?" asked Whitefoot the Wood\r\nMouse.  "They look to me as if they are covered with fur.  I always\r\nsupposed them to be hard like bone."\r\n\r\n"So they will be a month from now," explained Old Mother Nature,\r\nsmiling down at Whitefoot.  "That which you call fur will come off.\r\nHe will rub it off against the trees until his antlers are polished,\r\nand there is not a trace of it left.  You see Lightfoot has just\r\ngrown that set this summer."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean those antlers?" asked Danny Meadow Mouse, looking very\r\nmuch puzzled.  "Didn\'t he have any before?  How could things like\r\nthose grow, anyway?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know that he loses his horns, I mean antlers, every\r\nyear?" demanded Jumper the Hare.  "I thought every one knew that.\r\nHis old ones fell off late last winter.  I know, for I saw him\r\njust afterward, and he looked sort of ashamed.  Anyway, he didn\'t\r\ncarry his head as proudly as he does now.  He looked a lot like\r\nMrs. Lightfoot; you know she hasn\'t any antlers."\r\n\r\n"But how could hard, bony things like those grow?" persisted Danny\r\nMeadow Mouse.\r\n\r\n"I think I will have to explain," said Old Mother Nature.  "They\r\nwere not hard and bony when they were growing.  Just as soon as\r\nLightfoot\'s old antlers dropped off, the new ones started.  They\r\nsprouted out of his head just as plants sprout out of the ground,\r\nand they were soft and very tender and filled with blood, just\r\nas all parts of your body are.  At first they were just two round\r\nknobs.  Then these pushed out and grew and grew.  Little knobs\r\nsprang out from them and grew to make the branches you see now.\r\nAll the time they were protected by a furry skin which looks a\r\ngreat deal like what men call velvet.  When Lightfoot\'s antlers\r\nare covered with this, they are said to be in the velvet state.\r\n\r\n"When they had reached their full size they began to shrink and\r\nharden, so that now they are quite hard, and very soon that velvet\r\nwill begin to come off.  When they were growing they were so tender\r\nthat Lightfoot didn\'t move about any more than was necessary and\r\nkept quite by himself.  He was afraid of injuring those antlers.\r\nBy the time cool weather comes, Lightfoot will be quite ready to\r\nuse those sharp points on anybody who gets in his way.\r\n\r\n"As Jumper has said, Mrs. Lightfoot has no antlers.  Otherwise she\r\nlooks much like Lightfoot, save that she is not quite as big.  Have\r\nany of you ever seen her babies?"\r\n\r\n"I have," declared Jumper, who, as you know, lives in the Green\r\nForest just as Lightfoot does.  "They are the dearest little\r\nthings and look like their mother, only they have the loveliest\r\nspotted coats."\r\n\r\n"That is to help them to remain unseen by their enemies," explained\r\nOld Mother Nature.  When they lie down where the sun breaks through\r\nthe trees and spots the ground with light they seem so much like\r\ntheir surroundings that unless they move they are not often seen\r\neven by the sharpest eyes that may pass close by.  They lie with\r\ntheir little necks and heads stretched flat on the ground and do\r\nnot move so much as a hair.  You see, they usually are very\r\nobedient, and the first thing their mother teaches them is to keep\r\nperfectly still when she leaves them.\r\n\r\n"When they are a few months old and able to care for themselves a\r\nlittle, the spots disappear.  As a rule Mrs. Lightfoot has two\r\nbabies each spring.  Once in a while she has three, but two is the\r\nrule.  She is a good mother and always on the watch for possible\r\ndanger.  While they are very small she keeps them hidden in the\r\ndeepest thickets.  By the way, do you know that Lightfoot and Mrs.\r\nLightfoot are fine swimmers?"\r\n\r\nHappy Jack Squirrel looked the surprise he felt.  "I don\'t see how\r\nunder the sun any one with little hoofed feet like Lightfoot\'s can\r\nswim," said he.\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, Lightfoot is a good swimmer and fond of the water,"\r\nreplied Old Mother Nature.  "That is one way he has of escaping his\r\nenemies.  When he is hard pressed by Wolves or Dogs he makes for\r\nthe nearest water and plunges in.  He does not hesitate to swim\r\nacross a river or even a small lake.\r\n\r\n"Lightfoot prefers the Green Forest where there are close thickets\r\nwith here and there open places.  He likes the edge of the Green\r\nForest where he can come out in the open fields, yet be within a\r\nshort distance of the protecting trees and bushes.  He requires\r\nmuch water and so is usually found not far from a brook, pond or\r\nriver.  He has a favorite drinking place and goes to drink early\r\nin the morning and just at dusk.  During the day he usually sleeps\r\nhidden away in a thicket or under a windfall, coming out late in\r\nthe afternoon.  He feeds mostly in the early evening.  He eats\r\ngrass and other plants, beechnuts and acorns, leaves and twigs\r\nof certain trees, lily pads in summer and, I am sorry to say,\r\ndelights to get into Farmer Brown\'s garden, where almost every\r\ngreen thing tempts him.\r\n\r\n"Like so many others he has a hard time in winter, particularly\r\nwhen the snows are deep.  Then he and Mrs. Lightfoot and their\r\nchildren live in what is called a yard.  Of course it isn\'t really\r\na yard such as Farmer Brown has.  It is simply a place where they\r\nkeep the snow trodden down in paths which cross and cross, and is\r\nmade where there is shelter and food.  The food is chiefly twigs\r\nand leaves of evergreen trees.  As the snow gets deeper and deeper\r\nthey become prisoners in the yard until spring comes to melt the\r\nsnow and set them free.\r\n\r\n"Lightfoot depends for safety more on his nose and ears than on his\r\neyes.  His sense of smell is wonderful, and when he is moving about\r\nhe usually goes up wind; that is, in the direction from which the\r\nwind is blowing.  This is so that it will bring to him the scent\r\nof any enemy that may be ahead of him.  He is very clever and\r\ncunning.  Often before lying down to rest he goes back a short\r\ndistance to a point where he can watch his trail, so that if any\r\none is following it he will have warning.\r\n\r\n"His greatest enemy is the hunter with his terrible gun.  How any\r\none can look into those great soft eyes of Lightfoot and then even\r\nthink of trying to kill him is more than I can understand.  Dogs\r\nare his next worst enemies when he lives near the homes of men.\r\nWhen he lives where Wolves, Panthers and Bears are found, he has\r\nto be always on the watch for them.  Tufty the Lynx is ever on the\r\nwatch for Lightfoot\'s babies.\r\n\r\n"The White-tailed Deer is the most widely distributed of all the\r\nDeer family.  He is found from the Sunny South to the great forests\r\nof the North--everywhere but in the vast open plains of the middle\r\nof this great country.  That is, he used to be.  In  many places\r\nhe has been so hunted by man that he has disappeared.  When he\r\nlives in the Sunny South he never grows to be as big as when he\r\nlives in the North.\r\n\r\n"In the great mountains of the Far West lives a cousin, Blacktail,\r\nalso called Columbian Blacktailed Deer, and another cousin, Forkhorn\r\nthe Mule Deer.  Blacktail is nearly the size of Lightfoot.  He is not\r\nquite so graceful, his ears are larger, being much like those of\r\nForkhorn the Mule Deer, to whom he is closely related, and his tail\r\nis wholly black on the upper surface.  It is from this he gets his\r\nname.  His antlers vary, sometimes being much like those of Lightfoot\r\nand again like those of Forkhorn.  He is a lover of dense forests and\r\nis not widely distributed.  He is not nearly so smart as Lightfoot in\r\noutwitting hunters.\r\n\r\n"Forkhorn the Mule Deer, sometimes called Jumping Deer, is larger\r\nthan Lightfoot and much more heavily built.  His big ears, much\r\nlike those of a Mule, have won for him the name of Mule Deer.  His\r\nface is a dull white with a black patch on the forehead and a black\r\nband under the chin.  His tail is rather short and is not broad at\r\nthe base like Lightfoot\'s.  It is white with a black tip.  Because\r\nof this he is often called Blacktailed Deer, but this is wrong\r\nbecause that name belongs to his cousin, the true Blacktail.\r\n\r\n"Forkhorn\'s antlers are his glory.  They are even finer than\r\nLightfoot\'s.  The prongs, or tines, are in pairs like the letter Y\r\ninstead of in a row as are those of Lightfoot, and usually there\r\nare two pairs on each antler.  Forkhorn prefers rough country and\r\nthere he is very much at home, his powers of jumping enabling him\r\nto travel with ease where his enemies find it difficult to follow.\r\nLike Blacktail he is not nearly so clever as Lightfoot the White-tail\r\nand so is more easily killed by hunters.\r\n\r\n"All these members of the Deer family belong to the round-horn\r\nbranch, and are very much smaller than the members of the flat-horn\r\nbranch.  But there is one who in size makes all the others look\r\nsmall indeed.  It is Bugler the Elk, or Wapiti, of whom I shall\r\ntell you to-morrow."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI  Bugler, Flathorns and Wanderhoof\r\n\r\nLightfoot the Deer was the first one on hand the next morning.  In\r\nfact, he arrived before sun-up and, lying down in a little thicket\r\nclose at hand, made himself very comfortable to wait for the\r\nopening of school.  You see, not for anything would he have missed\r\nthat lesson about his big cousins.  There the others found him\r\nwhen they arrived.\r\n\r\n"The Deer family," began Old Mother Nature, "is divided into two\r\nbranches--the round-horned and the flat-horned.  I have told you\r\nabout the round-horned Deer with the exception of the largest and\r\nnoblest, Bugler the Elk.  He is commonly called Elk, but his\r\nright name is Wapiti.\r\n\r\n"Bugler is found only in the great mountains of the Far West, but\r\nonce, before hunters with terrible guns came, Elk were found in\r\nnearly all parts of this country excepting the Far South and the\r\nFar North--even on the great plains.  Now Bugler lives only in the\r\nforests of the great mountains."\r\n\r\n"How big is he?" asked Lightfoot.\r\n\r\n"So big that beside him you would look very small," replied Old\r\nMother Nature.  "Have you ever seen Farmer Brown\'s Horse?"\r\n\r\nLightfoot nodded.  "Well, Bugler stands as high as that Horse,"\r\nreplied Old Mother Nature.  "He isn\'t as heavy, for his body is of\r\ndifferent shape, not so big around, but at that he weighs three\r\ntimes as much as you do.  In summer his coat is a light\r\nyellowish-brown, becoming very dark on his neck and underneath.  His\r\nlegs are dark brown.  The hair on his neck is long and coarse.  His tail\r\nis very small, and around it is a large patch so light in color as to be\r\nalmost whitish.  In winter his coat becomes dark gray.\r\n\r\n"Bugler\'s crowning glory are his antlers.  They are very large and\r\nwide-spreading, sweeping backward and upward, the long prongs, or\r\ntines, curving upward from the front instead of from the back, as\r\nin the case of Lightfoot\'s antlers.  Above each eye is a long sharp\r\nprong.  So big are these antlers that Bugler looks almost as if\r\nhe were carrying a small, bare tree on his head.\r\n\r\n"Big as these antlers are, they are grown in a few months for\r\nBugler is like his small cousins in that he loses his antlers at\r\nthe end of every winter and must grow a new pair.  While they are\r\ngrowing, he hides in the wildest places he can find, high up on\r\nthe mountains.  Mrs. Bugler is at that time down in a valley with\r\nher baby or babies.  Usually she has one, but sometimes twins.\r\nShe has no antlers.\r\n\r\n"In the fall, when his antlers have hardened, Bugler moves down\r\nto join his family.  The bigger and stronger he is, the bigger his\r\nfamily is, for he has a number of wives and they all live together\r\nin a herd or band of which Bugler is lord and master.  He is ready\r\nand eager to fight for them, and terrible battles take place when\r\nanother disputes his leadership.  At this season he has a habit of\r\nstretching his neck out and emitting a far-reaching trumpet-like\r\nsound from which he gets the name of Bugler.  It is a warning that\r\nhe is ready to fight.\r\n\r\n"When the snows of winter come, many families get together and form\r\ngreat bands.  Then they move down from the mountains in search of\r\nshelter and food.  When a winter is very bad, many starve to death,\r\nfor man has fenced in and made into farms much of the land where\r\nthe elk once found ample food for winter.\r\n\r\n"But big as is Bugler the Elk, there is a cousin who is bigger, the\r\nbiggest of all the Deer family.  It is Flathorns the Moose.  As you\r\nmust guess by his name he is a member of the flat-horned branch of\r\nthe family.  His antlers spread widely and are flattened instead\r\nof being round.  From the edges of the flattened part many sharp\r\npoints spring out.\r\n\r\n"Flathorns, wearing his crown of great spreading antlers, is a\r\nnoble appearing animal because of his great size, but when his\r\nantlers have dropped he is a homely fellow.  Mrs. Flathorns, who\r\nhas no antlers, is very homely.  As I have said, Flathorns is the\r\nbiggest member of the Deer family.  He is quite as big as Farmer\r\nBrown\'s Horse and stands much higher at the shoulders.  Indeed, his\r\nshoulders are so high that he has a decided hump there, for they are\r\nwell above the line of his back.  His neck is very short, large and\r\nthick, and his head is not at all like the heads of other members\r\nof the Deer family.  Instead of the narrow, pointed face of other\r\nmembers of the Deer family, he has a broad, long face, rather more\r\nlike that of a Horse.  Towards the nose it humps up, and the great\r\nthick upper lip overhangs the lower one.  His nose is very broad,\r\nand for his size his eyes are small.  His ears are large.\r\n\r\n"From his throat hangs a hairy fold of skin called a bell.  He has\r\na very short tail, so short that it is hardly noticeable.  His legs\r\nare very long and rather large.  His hoofs are large and rounded,\r\nmore like those of Bossy the Cow than like those of Lightfoot the\r\nDeer.  Seen at a little distance in the woods, he looks to be almost\r\nblack, but really is for the most part dark brown.  His legs are gray\r\non the inside.\r\n\r\n"Flathorns lives in the great northern forests clear across the\r\ncountry, and is especially fond of swampy places.  He is fond of\r\nthe water and is a good swimmer.  In summer he delights to feed\r\non the pads, stems and roots of water lilies, and his long legs\r\nenable him to wade out to get them.  For the most part his food\r\nconsists of leaves and tender twigs of young trees, such as\r\nstriped maple, aspen, birch, hemlock, alder and willow.  His great\r\nheight enables him to reach the upper branches of young trees.  When\r\nthey are too tall for this, he straddles them and bends or breaks\r\nthem down to get at the upper branches.  His front teeth are big,\r\nbroad and sharp-edged.  With these he strips the bark from the\r\nlarger branches.  He also eats grass and moss.  Because of his\r\nlong legs and short neck he finds it easiest to kneel when feeding\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\n"Big as he is, he can steal through thick growth without making a\r\nsound.  He does not jump like other Deer, but travels at an awkward\r\ntrot which takes him over the ground very fast.  In the winter\r\nwhen snow is deep, the Moose family lives in a yard such as I told\r\nyou Lightfoot makes.  The greatest enemy of Flathorns is the hunter,\r\nand from being much hunted Flathorns has learned to make the most of\r\nhis ears, eyes and nose.  He is very smart and not easily surprised.\r\nWhen wounded he will sometimes attack man, and occasionally when not\r\nwounded.  Then he strikes with his sharp-edged front hoofs, and they\r\nare terrible weapons.  Altogether he is a wonderful animal, and it\r\nis a matter for sorrow that man persists in hunting him merely to get\r\nhis wonderful head.\r\n\r\n"In parts of these same northern forests lives another big member\r\nof the Deer family, Wanderhoof the Woodland Caribou.  He is bigger\r\nthan Lightfoot the Deer, but smaller than Bugler the Elk, rather\r\nan awkward-looking fellow.  His legs are quite long but stout.  His\r\nneck is rather short, and instead of carrying his head proudly as\r\ndoes Lightfoot, he carries it stretched out before him or hanging\r\nlow.  The hair on the lower part of his neck is long.\r\n\r\n"Wanderhoof wears a coat of brown.  His neck being much lighter or\r\nalmost gray.  He has an undercoat which is very thick and woolly.\r\nIn winter his whole coat becomes grayish and his neck white.  Above\r\neach hoof is a band of white.  His tail is very short, and white\r\non the under side.  His antlers are wonderful, being very long and\r\nboth round and flat.  That is, parts of them are round and parts\r\nflattened.  They have more prongs than those of any other Deer.\r\n\r\n"His hoofs are very large, deeply slit, and cup-shaped.  When he\r\nwalks they make a snapping or clicking sound.  These big feet were\r\ngiven him for a purpose.  He is very fond of boggy ground, and\r\nbecause of these big feet and the fact that the hoofs spread when\r\nhe steps, he can walk safely where others would sink in.  This is\r\nequally true in snow, when they serve as snowshoes.  As a result\r\nhe is not forced to live in yards as are Lightfoot and Flathorns\r\nwhen the snow is deep, but goes where he pleases.\r\n\r\n"He is very fond of the water and delights to splash about in it,\r\nand is a splendid swimmer.  His hair floats him so that when\r\nswimming he is higher out of water than any other member of the\r\nfamily.  In winter he lives in the thickest parts of the forest\r\namong the hemlocks and spruces, and feeds on the mosses and lichens\r\nwhich grow on the trees.  In summer he moves to the open, boggy\r\nground around shallow lakes where moss covers the ground, and on\r\nthis he lives.\r\n\r\n"He is a great wanderer, hence his name Wanderhoof.  Mrs. Caribou\r\nhas antlers, wherein she differs from Mrs. Lightfoot, Mrs. Flathorns\r\nand Mrs. Bugler.  Wanderhoof is fond of company and usually is\r\nfound with many companions of his own kind.  When they are moving\r\nfrom their summer home to their winter home, or back again, they\r\noften travel in very large bands.\r\n\r\n"In the Far North beyond the great forests Wanderhoof has a cousin\r\nwho looks very much like him, called the Barren Ground Caribou.\r\nThe name comes from the fact that way up there little excepting\r\nmoss grows, and on this the Caribou lives.  In summer this Caribou\r\nis found almost up to the Arctic Ocean, moving southward in great\r\nherds as the cold weather approaches.  No other animals of to-day\r\nget together in such great numbers.  In the extreme North is another\r\nCaribou, called Peary\'s Caribou, whose coat is wholly white.  The\r\nCaribou are close cousins of the Reindeer and look much like them.\r\n\r\n"All male members of the smaller Deer are called bucks, the female\r\nmembers are called does, and the young are called fawns.  All male\r\nmembers of the big Deer, such as Bugler the Elk, Flathorns the\r\nMoose and Wanderhoof the Caribou, are called bulls.  The females\r\nare called cows and the young are called calves.  All members of\r\nthe Deer family, with the exception of the Barren Ground Caribou,\r\nare forest-loving animals and are seldom seen far from the\r\nsheltering woods.\r\n\r\n"This, I think, will do for the Deer family.  To-morrow I shall\r\ntell you about Thunderfoot the Bison, Fleetfoot the Antelope, and\r\nLongcoat the Musk Ox."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII  Thunderfoot, Fleetfoot and Longcoat\r\n\r\n"Who remembers the name of the order to which all members of the\r\nDeer family belong?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"I remember what it means, but not the name," spoke up Happy Jack\r\nSquirrel.  "It means hoofed."\r\n\r\n"It is Un--Un-Ungu--" began Peter Rabbit and then stopped.  For\r\nthe life of him he couldn\'t think of the rest.\r\n\r\n"Ungulata," Old Mother Nature finished for him.  "And Happy Jack\r\nhas the meaning right.  It is the order to which all hoofed animals\r\nbelong.  There are several families in the order, one of which you\r\nalready have learned about--the Deer family.  Now comes the family\r\nof Cattle and Sheep.  It is called the Bovidae family, and the\r\nbiggest and most important member is Thunderfoot the Bison,\r\ncommonly called Buffalo.\r\n\r\n"Thunderfoot is more closely related to Bossy, Farmer Brown\'s Cow,\r\nthan are the members of the Deer family, for he has true horns, not\r\nantlers.  These are hollow and are not dropped each year, but are\r\ncarried through life.  Mrs. Thunderfoot has them also.  The horns\r\ngrow out from the sides of the forehead and then curve upward and\r\ninward, and are smooth and sharp.  They are never branched.\r\n\r\n"Thunderfoot is a great, heavy fellow the size of Farmer Brown\'s\r\nOx, and has a great hump on his shoulders.  He carries his head\r\nlow and from his throat hangs a great beard.  His head is large\r\nand is so covered with thick, curly hair that it appears much\r\nlarger than it really is.  His tail is rather short and ends in a\r\ntassel of hair.  The hair on his body and hind quarters is short\r\nand light brown, but on his shoulders and neck and his fore legs\r\nto the knees it is long and shaggy, dark brown above and almost\r\nblack below."\r\n\r\n"He must be a queer looking fellow," spoke up Chatterer the\r\nRed Squirrel.\r\n\r\n"He is," replied Old Mother Nature.  "The front half of him looks\r\nso much bigger than the rear half that it almost seems as if they\r\ndidn\'t belong together."\r\n\r\n"What does he eat?" asked Jumper the Hare.\r\n\r\n"Grass," replied Old Mother Nature promptly.  "He grazes just as\r\ndoes Bossy.  When the weather becomes hot his thick coat, although\r\nmuch of it has been shed, becomes most uncomfortable.  Also he is\r\ntormented by flies.  Then he delights in rolling in mud until he\r\nis plastered with it from head to feet.\r\n\r\n"Many years ago there were more Bison than any other large animal\r\nin this country, and they were found in nearly all parts of it.\r\nSome lived in the woods and were called Wood Buffaloes, but the\r\ngreatest number lived on the great plains and prairies, where the\r\ngrass was plentiful.  I have told you about the great herd of\r\nBarren Ground Caribou, but this is nothing to the great herds of\r\nBison that used to move north or south, according to the season,\r\nacross the great prairies.  In the fall they moved south.  In the\r\nspring they moved north, following the new grass as it appeared.\r\nWhen they galloped, the noise of their feet was like thunder.\r\n\r\n"But the hunters with terrible guns came and killed them for their\r\nskins, killed them by hundreds of thousands, and in just a few years\r\nthose great herds became only a memory.  Thunderfoot, once Lord of\r\nthe Prairies, was driven out of all his great kingdom, and the Bison,\r\nfrom being the most numerous of all large animals, is to-day reduced\r\nto just a few hundreds, and most of these are kept in parks by man.\r\nBarely in time did man make laws to protect Thunderfoot.  Without\r\nthis protection he would not exist to-day.\r\n\r\n"A close neighbor of Thunderfoot\'s in the days when he was Lord\r\nof the Prairies was Fleetfoot the Antelope.  Fleetfoot is about\r\nthe size of a small Deer, and in his graceful appearance reminds\r\none of Lightfoot, for he has the same trim body and long slim legs.\r\nHe is built for speed and looks it.  From just a glance at him you\r\nwould know him for a runner just as surely as a look at Jumper the\r\nHare would tell you that he must travel in great bounds.  The truth\r\nis, Fleetfoot is the fastest runner among all my children in this\r\ncountry.  Not one can keep up with him in a race.\r\n\r\n"Fleetfoot\'s coat is a light yellowish-brown on the back and white\r\nunderneath.  His forehead is brown and the sides of his face white.\r\nHis throat and under side of his neck are white, crossed by two bands\r\nof brown.  His hoofs, horns and eyes are black, and there is a black\r\nspot under each ear.  Near the end of his nose he is also black, and\r\ndown the back of his neck is a black line of stiff longer hairs.  A\r\nlarge white patch surrounds his short tail.  Who remembers what I\r\ntold you about Antelope Jack, the big Jack Hare of the Southwest?"\r\n\r\n"I do!" cried Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare together.\r\n\r\n"What was it, Jumper?" asked Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n"You said that he has a way of making the white of his sides seem\r\nto grow so that he seems almost all white, and can signal his\r\nfriends in this way," replied Jumper.\r\n\r\n"Quite right," replied Old Mother Nature.  "I am glad to find that\r\nyou remember so well.  Fleetfoot does the same thing with this\r\nwhite patch around his tail.  The hairs are quite long and he can\r\nmake them spread out so that that white patch becomes much larger,\r\nand when he is running it can be seen flashing in the sun long after\r\nhe is so far away that nothing else of him can be seen.  His eyes\r\nare wonderfully keen, so by means of these white patches he and his\r\nfriends can signal each other when they are far apart.\r\n\r\n"Fleetfoot has true horns, but they are unlike any other horns in\r\nthat they are shed every year, just like the antlers of the Deer\r\nfamily.  They grow straight up just over the eyes, are rather short,\r\nand fork.  One branch is much shorter than the other, and the longer\r\none is turned over at the end like a hook.  From these horns he gets\r\nthe name of Pronghorn.\r\n\r\n"When running from danger he carries his head low and makes long\r\nleaps.  When not frightened he trots and holds his head high and\r\nproudly.  He prefers flat open country, and there is no more\r\nbeautiful sight on all the great plains of the West than a band of\r\nFleetfoot and his friends.  He is social and likes the company of\r\nhis own kind.\r\n\r\n"The time was when these beautiful creatures were almost as numerous\r\nas the Bison, but like the latter they have been killed until now\r\nthere is real danger that unless man protects them better than he\r\nis doing there will come a day when the last Antelope will be killed,\r\nand one of the most beautiful and interesting of all my children will\r\nbe but a memory."\r\n\r\nThere was a note of great sadness in Old Mother Nature\'s voice.\r\nFor a few minutes no one spoke.  All were thinking of the terrible\r\nthing that had happened at the hands of man to the great hosts of\r\ntwo of the finest animals in all this great land, the Bison and\r\nAntelope, and there was bitterness in the heart of each one, for\r\nthere was not one there who did not himself have cause to fear man.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature was the first to break the silence.  "Now," said\r\nshe, "I will tell you of the oddest member of the Cattle and Sheep\r\nfamily.  It is Longcoat the Musk Ox, and he appears to belong\r\nwholly neither to the Cattle nor the Sheep branch of the family,\r\nbut to both.  He connects the two branches in appearance, reminding\r\none somewhat of a small Bison and at the same time having things\r\nabout him very like a Sheep.\r\n\r\n"Longcoat the Musk Ox lives in the Farthest North, the land of snow\r\nand ice.  He has been found very near the Arctic Ocean, and how he\r\nfinds enough to eat in the long winter is a mystery to those who\r\nknow that snow-covered land.  He is a heavily built, round-bodied\r\nanimal with short, stout legs, shoulders so high that they form a\r\nhump, a low-hung head and sheeplike face, heavy horns which are\r\nflat and broad at the base and meet at the center of the forehead,\r\nsweeping down on each side of the head and then turning up in sharp\r\npoints.  His tail is so short that it is hidden in the long hair\r\nwhich covers him.\r\n\r\n"This hair is so long that it hangs down on each side so that often\r\nit touches the snow and hides his legs nearly down to his feet.  In\r\ncolor it is very dark-brown, almost black, and on his sides is\r\nstraight.  But on his shoulders it is curly.  In the middle of the\r\nback is a patch of shorter dull-gray hair.\r\n\r\n"Underneath this coat of long hair is another coat of woolly, fine\r\nlight-brown hair, so close that neither cold nor rain can get through\r\nit.  It is this warm coat that makes it possible for him to live in\r\nthat terribly cold region.  He is about twice as heavy as a big Deer.\r\nAt times he gives off a musky odor, and it is from this that he gets\r\nhis name of Musk Ox.\r\n\r\n"Longcoat is seldom found alone, but usually with a band of his\r\nfriends.  This is partly for protection from his worst enemies, the\r\nWolves.  When the latter appear, Longcoat and his friends form a\r\ncircle with their heads out, and it is only a desperately hungry\r\nWolf that will try to break through that line of sharp-pointed horns.\r\n\r\n"In rough, rocky country he is as sure-footed as a Sheep.  In the\r\nshort summer of that region he finds plenty to eat, but in winter he\r\nhas to paw away the snow to get at the moss and other plants buried\r\nbeneath it.  Practically all other animals living so far North have\r\nwhite coats, but Longcoat retains his dark coat the year through.\r\n\r\n"My, how time flies!  This is all for to-day.  To-morrow I will\r\ntell you of two wonderful mountain climbers who go with ease where\r\neven man cannot follow."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII  Two Wonderful Mountain Climbers\r\n\r\n"Peter, you have been up in the Old Pasture many times, so you\r\nmust have seen the Sheep there," said Old Mother Nature, turning\r\nto Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Of course," replied Peter.  "They seem to me rather\r\nstupid creatures.  Anyway they look stupid."\r\n\r\n"Then you know the leader of the flock, the big ram with curling\r\nhorns," continued Old Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nPeter nodded, and Old Mother Nature went on.  "Just imagine him\r\nwith a smooth coat of grayish-brown instead of a white woolly one,\r\nand immense curling horns many times larger than those he now has.\r\nGive him a large whitish or very light-yellowish patch around a very\r\nshort tail.  Then you will have a very good idea of one of those\r\nmountain climbers I promised to tell you about, one of the greatest\r\nmountain climbers in all the Great World--Bighorn the Mountain Sheep,\r\nalso called Rocky Mountain Bighorn and Rocky Mountain Sheep.\r\n\r\n"Bighorn is a true Sheep and lives high up among the rocks of the\r\nhighest mountains of the Far West.  Like all members of the order\r\nto which he belongs his feet are hoofed, but they are hoofs which\r\nnever slip, and he delights to bound along the edges of great cliffs\r\nand in making his way up or down them where it looks as if it would\r\nbe impossible for even Chatterer the Red Squirrel to find footing,\r\nto say nothing of such a big fellow as Bighorn.\r\n\r\n"The mountains where he makes his home are so high that the tops of\r\nmany of them are in the clouds and covered with snow even in summer.\r\nAbove the line where trees can no longer grow Bighorn spends his\r\nsummers, coming down to the lower hills only when the snow becomes\r\nso deep that he cannot paw down through it to get food.  His eyesight\r\nis wonderful and from his high lookout he watches for enemies below,\r\nand small chance have they of approaching him from that direction.\r\n\r\n"When alarmed he bounds away gracefully as if there were great\r\nsprings in his legs, and his great curled horns are carried as\r\neasily as if they were nothing at all.  Down rock slopes, so\r\nsteep that a single misstep would mean a fall hundreds of feet,\r\nhe bounds as swiftly and easily as Lightfoot the Deer bounds\r\nthrough the woods, leaping from one little jutting point of rock\r\nto another and landing securely as if he were on level ground.\r\nHe climbs with equal ease where man would have to crawl and\r\ncling with fingers and toes, or give up altogether.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Bighorn does not have the great curling horns.  Instead she\r\nis armed with short, sharp-pointed horns, like spikes.  Her young\r\nare born in the highest, most inaccessible place she can find, and\r\nthere they have little to fear save one enemy, King Eagle.  Only\r\nsuch an enemy, one with wings, can reach them there.  Bighorn and\r\nMrs. Bighorn, because of their size, nothing to dread from these\r\ngreat birds, but helpless little lambs are continually in danger\r\nof furnishing King Eagle with the dinner he prizes.\r\n\r\n"Only when driven to the lower slopes and hills by storms and snow\r\ndoes Bighorn have cause to fear four-footed enemies.  Then Puma the\r\nPanther must be watched for, and lower down Howler the Wolf.  But\r\nBighorn\'s greatest enemy, and one he fears most, is the same one\r\nso many others have sad cause to fear--the hunter with his terrible\r\ngun.  The terrible gun can kill where man himself cannot climb, and\r\nBighorn has been persistently hunted for his head and wonderful horns.\r\n\r\n"Some people believe that Bighorn leaps from cliffs and alights on\r\nthose great horns, but this not true.  Whenever he leaps he alights\r\non those sure feet of his, not on his head.\r\n\r\n"Way up in the extreme northwest corner of this country, in a place\r\ncalled Alaska, is a close cousin whose coat is all white and whose\r\nhorns are yellow and more slender and wider spreading.  He called\r\nthe Dall Mountain Sheep.  Farther south, but not as far south as\r\nthe home of Bighorn, is another cousin whose coat is so dark that\r\nhe is sometimes called the Black Mountain Sheep.  His proper name\r\nis Stone\'s Mountain Sheep.  In the mountains between these two is\r\nanother cousin with a white head and dark body called Fannin\'s\r\nsheep.  All these cousins are closely related and in their habits\r\nare much alike.  Of them all, Bighorn the Rocky Mountain Sheep is\r\nthe best known."\r\n\r\n"I should think," said Peter Rabbit, "that way up there on those\r\nhigh mountains Bighorn would be very lonesome."\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed.  "Bighorn doesn\'t care for neighbors as\r\nyou do, Peter," said she.  "But even up in those high rocky retreats\r\namong the clouds he has a neighbor as sure-footed as himself, one\r\nwho stays winter as well as summer on the mountain tops.  It is\r\nBilly the Rocky Mountain Goat.\r\n\r\n"Billy is as awkward-looking as he moves about as Bighorn is graceful,\r\nbut he will go where even Bighorn will hesitate to follow.  His hoofs\r\nare small and especially planned for walking in safety on smooth rock\r\nand ice-covered ledges.  In weight he is about equal to Lightfoot the\r\nDeer, but he doesn\'t look in the least like him.\r\n\r\n"In the first place he has a hump on his shoulders much like the\r\nhumps of Thunderfoot the Bison and Longcoat the Musk Ox.  Of course\r\nthis means that he carries his head low.  His face is very long and\r\nfrom beneath his chin hangs a white beard.  From his forehead two\r\nrather short, slim, black horns stand up with a little curve backward.\r\nHis coat is white and the hair is long and straight.  Under this long\r\nwhite coat he wears a thick coat of short, woolly, yellowish-white fur\r\nwhich keeps him warm in the coldest weather.  He seldom leaves his\r\nbeloved mountain-tops, even in the worst weather of winter, as Bighorn\r\nsometimes does, but finds shelter among the rocks.  The result is that\r\nhe has practically no enemies save man to fear.\r\n\r\n"Often he spends the summer where the snow remains all the year\r\nthrough and his white coat is a protection from the keenest eyes.\r\nYou see, when not moving, he looks in the distance for all the\r\nworld like a patch of snow on the rocks.\r\n\r\n"Not having a handsome head or wonderful horns he has not been\r\nhunted by man quite so much as has Bighorn, and therefore is not so\r\nalert and wary.  Both he and Bighorn are more easily approached from\r\nabove than from below, because they do not expect danger from above\r\nand so do not keep so sharp a watch in that direction.  The young\r\nare sometimes taken by King Eagle, but otherwise Billy Goat\'s family\r\nhas little to fear from enemies, always excepting the hunter with\r\nhis terrible gun.\r\n\r\n"I have now told you of the members of the cattle and Sheep family,\r\nwhat they look like and where they live and how.  There is still\r\none more member of the order Ungulata and this one is in a way\r\nrelated to another member of Farmer Brown\'s barnyard.  I will leave\r\nyou to guess which one.  What is it, Peter?"\r\n\r\n"If you please, in just what part of the Far West are the mountains\r\nwhere Billy Goat lives?" replied Peter.\r\n\r\n"Chiefly in the northern part," replied Old Mother Nature.  "In the\r\nNorthwest these mountains are very close to the ocean and Billy\r\ndoes not appear to mind in the least the fogs that roll in, and\r\nseems to enjoy the salt air.  Sometimes there he comes down almost\r\nto the shore.  Are there any more questions?"\r\n\r\nThere were none, so school was dismissed for the day.  Peter didn\'t\r\ngo straight home.  Instead he went up to the Old Pasture for another\r\nlook at the old ram there and tried to picture to himself just what\r\nBighorn must look like.  Especially he looked at the hoofs of the\r\nold ram.\r\n\r\n"It is queer," muttered Peter, "how feet like those can be so safe\r\nup on those slippery rocks Old Mother Nature told us about.  Anyway,\r\nit seems queer to me.  But it must be so if she says it is.  My, my,\r\nmy, what a lot of strange people there are in this world!  And what\r\na lot there is to learn!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX  Piggy and Hardshell\r\n\r\nAll the way to school the next morning Peter Rabbit did his best to\r\nguess who it might be that they were to learn about that day.  "Old\r\nMother Nature said that he is related to some one who lives in Farmer\r\nBrown\'s barnyard," said Peter to himself.  "Now who can it be?"  But\r\ntry as he would, Peter couldn\'t think of any one.  He asked Jumper\r\nthe Hare if he had guessed who it could be.  Jumper shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the least idea," said he.  "You know I seldom leave the\r\nGreen Forest and I never have been over to that barnyard in my\r\nlife, so of course I don\'t know who lives there."\r\n\r\nDanny Meadow Mouse and Whitefoot the Wood Mouse were no wiser, nor\r\nwas Johnny Chuck.  But Chatterer the Red Squirrel, it was plain to\r\nsee, was quite sure he knew who it was.  Chatterer had been over\r\nto Farmer Brown\'s so often to steal corn from the corn crib that\r\nhe knew all about that barnyard and who lived there.  But though\r\nPeter and the others teased him to tell them he wouldn\'t.\r\n\r\nSo when Old Mother Nature asked who had guessed to whom she had\r\nreferred Chatterer was the only one to reply.  "I think you must\r\nhave meant the Pig who is always rooting about and grunting in\r\nthat barnyard," said he.\r\n\r\n"Your guess is right, Chatterer," she replied, smiling at the little\r\nred-coated rascal, "and this morning I will tell you a little about\r\na relative of his who doesn\'t live in a barnyard, but lives in the\r\nforest, as free and independent as you are.  It is Piggy the Peccary,\r\nknown as the Collared Peccary, also called Wild Pig, Muskhog, Texas\r\nPeccary and Javelina.\r\n\r\n"He is a true Pig and in shape resembles that lazy, fat fellow in\r\nFarmer Brown\'s barnyard when he was little.  You would know him for\r\na Pig right away if you should see him.  But in every other way\r\nexcepting his habit of rooting up the ground with his nose, he is\r\na wholly different fellow.  For one thing his legs, though short,\r\nare more slender and he is a fast runner.  There isn\'t a lazy bone\r\nin him, and he is too active to grow fat.\r\n\r\n"His head is large and his nose long, and his tail is almost no\r\ntail at all; it is just a little rounded knob, as if he had at one\r\ntime had a tail and it had been cut off.  His hair is coarse and\r\nstiff, the kind of hair called bristles.  From the back of his head\r\nalong his back the bristles are long and stout.  They are black at\r\nthe tips so that he appears to have a black back.  When Piggy is\r\nangry he raises these long bristles so that they stand straight\r\nup and this gives him a very fierce appearance.\r\n\r\n"His color is so dark a gray that at a distance he appears black.\r\nIndeed he is black on many parts of him.  Just back of the neck a\r\nwhitish band crosses the shoulders, and this is why he is called\r\nthe Collared Peccary.  You see he seems to be wearing a collar.\r\nOn each jaw are two great pointed teeth called tusks, the two\r\nupper ones so long that they project beyond the lips.  These tusks\r\nare Piggy\'s weapons, and very good ones they are.\r\n\r\n"The home of Piggy the Peccary is in the hot southwestern part of\r\nthis country, where live Jaguar and Ocelot, the beautiful spotted\r\nmembers of the Cat family.  They are two of his enemies.  He never\r\nlikes to be alone, but lives with a band of his friends and they\r\nroam about together.  He is found on the plains and among low hills,\r\nin swamps and dense forests, and among the thickets of cactus and\r\nother thorny plants that grow in dry regions.  Plenty of food and\r\nshelter from the hot sun seem to be the main things with Piggy."\r\n\r\n"What does he eat?" asked Peter Rabbit.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature laughed.  "It would be easier, Peter, to tell you\r\nwhat he doesn\'t eat," said she.  "He eats everything eatable, nuts,\r\nfruits, seeds, roots and plants of various kinds, insects, Frogs,\r\nLizards, Snakes and any small animals he can catch.  Sometimes he\r\ndoes great damage to gardens and crops planted by man.  He delights\r\nto root in the earth with his nose and often turns over much ground\r\nin this way, searching for roots good to eat.\r\n\r\n"On the lower part of his back he carries a little bag of musky\r\nscent, and from this he gets the name of Muskhog.  While as a rule\r\nhe wisely runs from danger, he is no coward, and will fight fiercely\r\nwhen cornered.  His friends at once rush to help him and surround the\r\nenemy, who is usually glad to climb a tree to escape their gnashing\r\ntusks.  However, he is not the fierce animal he has been reported to\r\nbe, ready to attack unprovoked.  He will run away if he can.  Mr. and\r\nMrs. Peccary have two babies at a time.\r\n\r\n"This is the last of the hoofed animals and the last but one of the\r\nland animals of this great country, so you see we are almost to the\r\nend of school.  This last one is perhaps the queerest of all.  It\r\nis Hardshell the Armadillo, and belongs to the order of Edentata,\r\nwhich means toothless."\r\n\r\n"Do you men to say that there are animals with no teeth at all?"\r\nasked Happy Jack Squirrel, looking as if he couldn\'t believe such\r\na thing.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Nature nodded.  "That is just what I mean," said she.\r\n"There are animals without any teeth, though not in this country,\r\nand others with so few teeth that they have been put in the same\r\norder with the wholly toothless ones.  Hardshell the Armadillo is\r\none of these.  He has no teeth at all in the front of his mouth\r\nand such teeth as he has got do not amount to much."\r\n\r\n"But why do you call him Hardshell?" asked Peter impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Because instead of a coat of fur he wears a coat of shell," replied\r\nOld Mother Nature, and then laughed right out at the funny expressions\r\non the faces before her.  It was quite clear that Peter and his\r\nfriends were having hard work to believe she was in earnest.  They\r\nsuspected her of joking.\r\n\r\n"Do--do you mean that he lives in a sort of house that he carries\r\nwith him like Spotty the Turtle?" ventured Peter.\r\n\r\n"It is a shell, but not like that of Spotty," explained Old Mother\r\nNature. "Spotty\'s shell is all one piece, but the Armadillo\'s shell\r\nis jointed, so that he can roll up like a ball.  Spotty isn\'t a\r\nmammal, as are all of you and all those we have been learning about,\r\nbut is a reptile.  Hardshell the Armadillo, on the other hand, is a\r\ntrue mammal."\r\n\r\n"Well, all I can say is that he must be a mighty queer looking\r\nfellow," declared Peter.\r\n\r\n"He is," replied Old Mother Nature.  "He is about the size of Unc\'\r\nBilly Possum, and if you can imagine a pig of about that size with\r\nvery short legs, a long tapering tail, feet with toes and long claws\r\nand a shell covering his whole body, the front of his face and even\r\nhis tail, you will have something of an idea what he looks like.\r\n\r\n"He lives down in the hot Southwest where Piggy the Peccary lives.\r\nHis coat of shell is yellowish in color and is divided in the middle\r\nof his body into nine narrow bands or joints.  Because of this he\r\nis called the Nine-banded Armadillo.  In the countries to the south\r\nof this he has a cousin with three bands and another with six.\r\n\r\n"Hardshell\'s head is very long and he carries it pointed straight\r\ndown.  His small eyes are set far back, and at the top of his head\r\nare rather large upright ears.  The shell of his tail is divided\r\ninto many jointed rings so that he can move it at will.\r\n\r\n"His tongue is long and sticky.  This is so that he can run it\r\nout for some distance and sweep up the Ants and insects on which\r\nhe largely lives.  His eyesight and hearing are not very good,\r\nand having such a heavy, stiff coat he is a poor runner.  But he\r\nis a good digger.  This means, of course, that he makes his home\r\nin a hole in the ground.  When frightened he makes for this, but\r\nif overtaken by an enemy he rolls up into a ball and is safe from\r\nall save those with big and strong enough teeth to break through\r\nthe joints of his shell.  He eats some vegetable matter and is\r\naccused of eating the eggs of ground-nesting birds, and of dead\r\ndecayed flesh he may find.  However, his food consists chiefly of\r\nAnts, insects of various kinds, and worms.  He is a harmless\r\nlittle fellow and interesting because he is so queer.  He is\r\nsometimes killed and eaten by man and his flesh is considered very\r\ngood. He has from four to eight babies in the early spring.  The\r\nbaby Armadillo has a soft, tough skin instead of a shell, and as\r\nit grows it hardens until by the time it is fully grown it has\r\nbecome a shell.\r\n\r\n"Now this finishes the lessons about the land animals or mammals.\r\nThere are other mammals who live in the ocean, which is the salt\r\nwater which surrounds the land, and which, I guess, none of you\r\nhave ever seen.  Some of these come on shore and some never do.\r\nTo-morrow I will tell you just a little about them, so that you\r\nwill know something about all the animals of this great country\r\nwhich is called North America.  That is, I will if you want me to."\r\n\r\n"We do!  Of course we do!" cried Peter Rabbit, and it is plain that\r\nhe spoke for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL  The Mammals of the Sea\r\n\r\nIt was the last day of Old Mother Nature\'s school in the Green Forest,\r\nand when jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun had climbed high enough in the\r\nblue, blue sky to peep down through the trees, he found not one missing\r\nof the little people who had been learning so much about themselves,\r\ntheir relatives, neighbors and all the other animals in every part of\r\nthis great country.  You see, not for anything in the world would one\r\nof them willingly have missed that last lesson.\r\n\r\n"I told you yesterday," began Old Mother Nature, "that the land is\r\nsurrounded by water, salt water, sometimes called the ocean and\r\nsometimes the sea.  In this live the largest animals in all the\r\nGreat World and many others, some of which sometimes come on land,\r\nand others which never do.\r\n\r\n"One of those which come on land is first cousin to Little Joe\r\nOtter and is named the Sea Otter.\r\n\r\n"He lives in the cold waters of the western ocean of the Far North.\r\nHe much resembles Little Joe Otter, whom you all know, but has finer,\r\nhandsomer fur.  In fact, so handsome is his fur that he has been\r\nhunted for it until now.  He is among the shyest and rarest of all\r\nanimals, and has taken to living in the water practically all the\r\ntime, rarely visiting land.  He lies on his back in the water and\r\ngets his food from the bottom of the sea.  It is chiefly clams and\r\nother shellfish.  He rests on floating masses of sea plants.  He is\r\nvery playful and delights to toss pieces of seaweed from paw to paw\r\nas he lies floating on his back.  Of course he is a wonderful swimmer\r\nand diver.  Otherwise he couldn\'t live in the sea.\r\n\r\n"Another who comes on land, but only for a very short distance from\r\nthe water, is called the Walrus.  He belongs to an order called\r\nFinnipedia, which means fin-footed.  Instead of having legs and\r\nfeet for walking, members of this order have limbs designed for\r\nswimming; these are more like fins or paddles than anything else\r\nand are called flippers.  The Walrus is so big that I can give\r\nyou no idea how big he is, excepting to say that he will weight\r\ntwo thousand pounds.  He is simply a great mass of living flesh\r\ncovered with a rough, very thick skin without hair.  From his\r\nupper jaw two immense ivory tusks hang straight down, and with\r\nthese he digs up shellfish at the bottom of the sea.  It is a\r\nterrible effort for him to move on shore, and so he is content to\r\nstay within a few feet of the water.  He also lives in the cold\r\nwaters of the Far North amidst floating ice.  On this he often\r\nclimbs out to lie for hours.  His voice is a deep grunt or\r\nbellowing roar.  The young are born on land close to the water.\r\n\r\n"The Sea Lions belong to this same fin-footed order.  The best\r\nknown of these are the California Sea Lion and the Fur Seal, which\r\nis not a true Seal.  The California Sea Lion is also called the\r\nBarking Sea Lion because of its habit of barking, and is the best\r\nknown of the family.  It is frequently seen on the rocks along the\r\nshore and on the islands off the western coast.  These Sea Lions\r\nare sleek animals, exceedingly graceful in the water.  They have\r\nlong necks and carry their heads high.  They are covered with short\r\ncoarse hair and have small, sharp-pointed ears.  Their front flippers\r\nhave neither hair nor claws, but their hind flippers have webbed\r\ntoes.  They are able to move about on land surprisingly well for\r\nanimals lacking regular legs and feet, and can climb on and over\r\nrocks rapidly.  Naturally they are splendid swimmers.\r\n\r\n"The largest member of the family is the Steller Sea Lion, who\r\nsometimes grows to be almost as big as a Walrus.  He is not sleek\r\nand graceful like his smaller cousin, but has an enormously thick\r\nneck and heavy shoulders.  His voice is a roar rather than a bark.\r\nThe head of an old Sea Lion is so much like that of a true Lion\r\nthat the name Sea Lion has been given this family.\r\n\r\n"The most valuable member of the family, so far as man is concerned,\r\nis the Fur Seal, also called Sea Bear.  It is very nearly the size\r\nand form of the California Sea Lion, but under the coarse outer hair,\r\nwhich is gray in color, is a wonderful soft, fine, brown fur and for\r\nthis the Fur Seal has been hunted so persistently that there was real\r\ndanger that soon the very last one would be killed.  Now wise and\r\nneeded laws protect the Fur Seals on their breeding grounds, which\r\nare certain islands in the Far North.  The young of all members of\r\nthis family are born on shore, but soon take to the water.  The Fur\r\nSeal migrates just as the birds do, but always returns to the place\r\nof its birth.  Man and the Polar Bear are its enemies on land and\r\nice, and the Killer Whale in the water.  Mr. Fur Seal always has many\r\nwives and this is true of the other members of the Sea Lion family\r\nand of the Walrus.  The males are three or four times the size of\r\nthe females.  Among themselves the males are fierce fighters.\r\n\r\n"The true Seals are short-necked, thick-bodied, and have rather\r\nround heads with no visible ears.  The Walrus and Sea Lions can\r\nturn their hind flippers forward to use as feet on land, but this\r\nthe true Seals cannot do.  Therefore they are more clumsy out of\r\nwater.  Their front flippers are covered with hair.\r\n\r\n"The one best known is the Harbor or Leopard Seal.  It is found\r\nalong both coasts, often swimming far up big rivers.  It is one\r\nof the smallest members of the family.  Sometimes it is\r\nyellowish-gray spotted with black and sometimes dark brown with light\r\nspots.\r\n\r\n"The Ringed Seal is about the same size or a little smaller than\r\nthe Harbor Seal and is found as far north as it can find breathing\r\nholes in the ice.  You know all these animals breathe air just as\r\nland animals do.  This Seal looks much like the Harbor Seal, but\r\nis a little more slender.\r\n\r\n"Another member of the family is the Harp, Saddle-back or Greenland\r\nSeal.  He is larger than the other two and has a black head and gray\r\nbody with a large black ring on the back.  The female is not so\r\nhandsome, being merely spotted.\r\n\r\n"The handsomest Seal is the Ribbon Seal.  He is about the size of\r\nhis cousin the Harbor Seal.  He is also called the Harlequin Seal.\r\nSometimes his coat is blackish-brown and sometimes yellowish-gray,\r\nbut always he has a band of yellowish-white, like a broad ribbon,\r\nfrom his throat around over the top of his head, and another band\r\nwhich starts on his chest and goes over his shoulder, curves down\r\nand finally goes around his body not far above the hind flippers.\r\nOnly the male is so marked.  This Seal is rather rare.  Like most\r\nof the others it lives in the cold waters of the Far North.\r\n\r\n"The largest of the Seals is the Elephant Seal, once numerous, but\r\nkilled by man until now there are few members of this branch of the\r\nfamily.  He is a tremendous fellow and has a movable nose which hangs\r\nseveral inches below his mouth.\r\n\r\n"The queerest-looking member of the family is the Hooded Seal.  Mr.\r\nSeal of this branch of the family is rather large, and on top of\r\nhis nose he carries a large bag of skin which he can fill with air\r\nuntil he looks as if he were wearing a queer hood or bonnet.\r\n\r\n"The Seals complete the list of animals which live mostly in the\r\nwater but come out on land or ice at times.  Now I will tell you\r\nof a true mammal, warm-blooded, just as you are, and air-breathing,\r\nbut which never comes on land.  This is the Manatee or Sea Cow.  It\r\nlives in the warm waters of the Sunny South, coming up from the sea\r\nin the big rivers.  It is a very large animal, sometimes growing as\r\nbig as a medium-sized Walrus.  The head is round, somewhat like that\r\nof a Seal.  The lips are thick and big, the upper one split in the\r\nmiddle.  The eyes are small.  It has but two flippers, and these are\r\nset in at the shoulders.  Instead of hind flippers, such as the Seals\r\nand Sea Lions have, the Manatee has a broad, flattened and rounded\r\ntail which is used as a propeller, just as fish use their tails.\r\nThe neck is short and large.  In the water the Manatee looks black.\r\nThe skin is almost hairless.\r\n\r\n"This curious animal lives on water plants.  Sometimes it will come\r\nclose to a river bank and with head and shoulders out of water feed\r\non the grasses which hang down from the bank.  The babies are, of\r\ncourse, born in the water, as the Manatee never comes on shore.\r\nNow I think this will end to-day\'s lesson and the school."\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit hopped up excitedly.  "You said that the largest\r\nanimals in the world live in the sea, and you haven\'t told us what\r\nthey are," he cried.\r\n\r\n"True enough, Peter," replied Old Mother Nature pleasantly.  "The\r\nlargest living animal is a Whale, a true mammal and not a fish at\r\nall, as some people appear to think.  There are several kinds of\r\nWhales, some of them comparatively small and some the largest\r\nanimals in the world, so large that I cannot give you any idea of\r\nhow big they are.  Beside one of these, the biggest Walrus would\r\nlook like a baby.  But the Whales do not belong just to this\r\ncountry, so I think we will not include them.\r\n\r\n"Now we will close school.  I hope you have enjoyed learning as\r\nmuch as I have enjoyed teaching, and I hope that what you have\r\nlearned will be of use to you as long as you live.  The more\r\nknowledge you possess the better fitted for your part in the work\r\nof the Great World you will be.  Don\'t forget that, and never miss\r\na chance to learn."\r\n\r\nAnd so ended Old Mother Nature\'s school in the Green Forest.  One\r\nby one her little pupils thanked her for all she had taught them,\r\nand then started for home.  Peter Rabbit was the last.\r\n\r\n"I know ever and ever so much more than I did when I first came to\r\nyou, but I guess that after all I know very little of all there is\r\nto know," said he shyly, which shows that Peter really had learned\r\na great deal.  Then he started for the dear Old Briar-patch,\r\nlipperty-lipperty-lip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Burgess Animal Book for Children, by\r\nThornton W.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
