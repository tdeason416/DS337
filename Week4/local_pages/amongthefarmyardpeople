DUTTON AND COMPANY\r\n  31 WEST TWENTY-THIRD STREET\r\n  1899\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CHILDREN\r\n\r\n_Dear Little Friends:_\r\n\r\nI want to introduce the farmyard people to you, and to have you call\r\nupon them and become better acquainted as soon as you can. Some of them\r\nare working for us, and we surely should know them. Perhaps, too, some\r\nof us are working for them, since that is the way in this delightful\r\nworld of ours, and one of the happiest parts of life is helping and\r\nbeing helped.\r\n\r\nIt is so in the farmyard, and although there is not much work that the\r\npeople there can do for each other, there are many kind things to be\r\nsaid, and even the Lame Duckling found that he could make the Blind\r\nHorse happy when he tried. It is there as it is everywhere else, and I\r\nsometimes think that although the farmyard people do not look like us or\r\ntalk like us, they are not so very different after all. If you had seen\r\nthe little Chicken who wouldn\'t eat gravel when his mother was reproving\r\nhim, you could not have helped knowing his thoughts even if you did not\r\nunderstand a word of the Chicken language. He was thinking, "I don\'t\r\ncare! I don\'t care a bit! So now!" That was long since, for he was a\r\nChicken when I was a little girl, and both of us grew up some time ago.\r\nI think I have always been more sorry for him because when he was\r\nlearning to eat gravel I was learning to eat some things which I did not\r\nlike; and so, you see, I knew exactly how he felt. But it was not until\r\nafterwards that I found out how his mother felt.\r\n\r\nThat is one of the stories which I have been keeping a long time for\r\nyou, and the Chicken was a particular friend of mine. I knew him better\r\nthan I did some of his neighbors; yet they were all pleasant\r\nacquaintances, and if I did not see some of these things happen with my\r\nown eyes, it is just because I was not in the farmyard at the right\r\ntime. There are many other tales I should like to tell you about them,\r\nbut one mustn\'t make the book too fat and heavy for your hands to hold,\r\nso I will send you these and keep the rest.\r\n\r\nMany stories might be told about our neighbors who live out-of-doors,\r\nand they are stories that ought to be told, too, for there are still\r\nboys and girls who do not know that animals think and talk and work, and\r\nlove their babies, and help each other when in trouble. I knew one boy\r\nwho really thought it was not wrong to steal newly built birds\'-nests,\r\nand I have seen girls--quite large ones, too--who were afraid of Mice!\r\nIt was only last winter that a Quail came to my front door, during the\r\nvery cold weather, and snuggled down into the warmest corner he could\r\nfind. I fed him, and he stayed there for several days, and I know, and\r\nyou know, perfectly well that although he did not say it in so many\r\nwords, he came to remind me that I had not yet told you a Quail story.\r\nAnd two of my little neighbors brought ten Polliwogs to spend the day\r\nwith me, so I promised then and there that the next book should be about\r\npond people and have a Polliwog story in it.\r\n\r\nAnd now, good-bye! Perhaps some of you will write me about your visits\r\nto the farmyard. I hope you will enjoy them very much, but be sure you\r\ndon\'t wear red dresses or caps when you call on the Turkey Gobbler.\r\n\r\n      Your friend,\r\n  CLARA DILLINGHAM PIERSON.\r\n\r\n     Stanton, Michigan,\r\n        March 28, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n  THE STORY THAT THE SWALLOW DIDN\'T TELL                               1\r\n\r\n  THE LAMB WITH THE LONGEST TAIL                                      12\r\n\r\n  THE WONDERFUL SHINY EGG                                             20\r\n\r\n  THE DUCKLING WHO DIDN\'T KNOW WHAT TO DO                             33\r\n\r\n  THE FUSSY QUEEN BEE                                                 47\r\n\r\n  THE BAY COLT LEARNS TO MIND                                         64\r\n\r\n  THE TWIN LAMBS                                                      82\r\n\r\n  THE VERY SHORT STORY OF THE FOOLISH LITTLE MOUSE                    96\r\n\r\n  THE LONELY LITTLE PIG                                              106\r\n\r\n  THE KITTEN WHO LOST HERSELF                                        116\r\n\r\n  THE CHICKEN WHO WOULDN\'T EAT GRAVEL                                136\r\n\r\n  THE GOOSE WHO WANTED HER OWN WAY                                   149\r\n\r\n  WHY THE SHEEP RAN AWAY                                             160\r\n\r\n  THE FINE YOUNG RAT AND THE TRAP                                    172\r\n\r\n  THE QUICK-TEMPERED TURKEY GOBBLER                                  186\r\n\r\n  THE BRAGGING PEACOCK                                               199\r\n\r\n  THE DISCONTENTED GUINEA HEN                                        213\r\n\r\n  THE OXEN TALK WITH THE CALVES                                      232\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n  THE SWALLOWS ARE COMING                                              2\r\n\r\n  THE LAMB WITH THE LONGEST TAIL                                      16\r\n\r\n  THEY HAD A GOOD SWIM                                                40\r\n\r\n  HAD A SORE MOUTH FROM JERKING ON THE LINES                          77\r\n\r\n  FEEDING THE LAMBS                                                   84\r\n\r\n  EVERY BROWN PIG RAN OFF                                            110\r\n\r\n  "I AM THE WHITE KITTEN"                                            130\r\n\r\n  THE GRAY GOOSE TRIED TO GO THROUGH                                 156\r\n\r\n  COLLIE AND THE BELL-WETHER                                         170\r\n\r\n  THE BIG GOBBLER CAME PUFFING TOWARD\r\n    HER. _Frontispiece_                                              194\r\n\r\n  THE PEACOCK WAS STANDING ON THE FENCE,                             208\r\n\r\n  THE RED CALF AND THE WHITE CALF                                    243\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY THAT THE SWALLOW DIDN\'T TELL\r\n\r\n\r\n"Listen!" said the Nigh Ox, "don\'t you hear some friends coming?"\r\n\r\nThe Off Ox raised his head from the grass and stopped to brush away a\r\nFly, for you never could hurry either of the brothers. "I don\'t hear any\r\nfootfalls," said he.\r\n\r\n"You should listen for wings, not feet," said the Nigh Ox, "and for\r\nvoices, too."\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke there floated down from the clear air overhead a soft\r\n"tittle-ittle-ittle-ee," as though some bird were laughing for\r\nhappiness. There was not a cloud in the sky, and the meadow was covered\r\nwith thousands and thousands of green grass blades, each so small and\r\ntender, and yet together making a most beautiful carpet for the feet of\r\nthe farmyard people, and offering them sweet and juicy food after their\r\nwinter fare of hay and grain. Truly it was a day to make one laugh aloud\r\nfor joy. The alder tassels fluttered and danced in the spring breeze,\r\nwhile the smallest and shyest of the willow pussies crept from their\r\nlittle brown houses on the branches to grow in the sunshine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SWALLOWS ARE COMING.]\r\n\r\n"Tittle-ittle-ittle-ee! Tittle-ittle-ittle-ee!" And this time it was\r\nlouder and clearer than before.\r\n\r\n"The Swallows!" cried the Oxen to each other. Then they straightened\r\ntheir strong necks and bellowed to the Horses, who were drawing the plow\r\nin the field beyond, "The Swallows are coming!"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Horses reached the end of the furrow and could rest a\r\nminute, they tossed their heads and whinnied with delight. Then they\r\nlooked around at the farmer, and wished that he knew enough of the\r\nfarmyard language to understand what they wanted to tell him. They knew\r\nhe would be glad to hear of their friends\' return, for had they not seen\r\nhim pick up a young Swallow one day and put him in a safer place?\r\n\r\n"Tittle-ittle-ittle-ee!" and there was a sudden darkening of the sky\r\nabove their heads, a whirr of many wings, a chattering and laughing of\r\nsoft voices, and the Swallows had come. Perched on the ridge-pole of the\r\nbig barn, they rested and visited and heard all the news.\r\n\r\nThe Doves were there, walking up and down the sloping sides of the roof\r\nand cooing to each other about the simple things of every-day life. You\r\nknow the Doves stay at home all winter, and so it makes a great change\r\nwhen their neighbors, the Swallows, return. They are firm friends in\r\nspite of their very different ways of living. There was never a Dove\r\nwho would be a Swallow if he could, yet the plump, quiet, gray and white\r\nDoves dearly love the dashing Swallows, and happy is the Squab who can\r\nget a Swallow to tell him stories of the great world.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it good to be home, home, home!" sang one Swallow. "I never set\r\nmy claws on another ridge-pole as comfortable as this."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to look at my old nest," said a young Swallow, as she\r\nsuddenly flew down to the eaves.\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ll go, too," said another young Swallow, springing away from\r\nhis perch. He was a handsome fellow, with a glistening dark blue head\r\nand back, a long forked tail which showed a white stripe on the under\r\nside, a rich buff vest, and a deep blue collar, all of the finest\r\nfeathers. He loved the young Swallow whom he was following, and he\r\nwanted to tell her so.\r\n\r\n"There is the nest where I was hatched," she said. "Would you think I\r\nwas ever crowded in there with five brothers and sisters? It was a\r\ncomfortable nest, too, before the winter winds and snow wore it away. I\r\nwonder how it would seem to be a fledgling again?" She snuggled down in\r\nthe old nest until he could see only her forked tail and her dainty head\r\nover the edge. Her vest was quite hidden, and the only light feathers\r\nthat showed were the reddish-buff ones on throat and face; these were\r\nnot so bright as his, but still she was beautiful to him. He loved every\r\nfeather on her body.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want you to be a fledgling again," he cried. "I want you to\r\nhelp me make a home under the eaves, a lovely little nest of mud and\r\nstraw, where you can rest as you are now doing, while I bring food to\r\nyou. Will you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she cried. "Tittle-ittle-ittle-ee! Oh, tittle-ittle-ittle-ee!"\r\nAnd she flew far up into the blue sky, while he followed her,\r\ntwittering and singing.\r\n\r\n"Where are those young people going?" said an older Swallow. "I should\r\nthink they had flown far enough for to-day without circling around for\r\nthe fun of it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you remember the days when you were young?" said the Swallow next\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n"When I was young?" he answered. "My dear, I am young now. I shall\r\nalways be young in the springtime. I shall never be old except when I am\r\nmoulting."\r\n\r\nJust then a family of Doves came pattering over the roof, swaying their\r\nheads at every step. "We are so glad to see you back," said the father.\r\n"We had a long, cold winter, and we thought often of you."\r\n\r\n"A very cold winter," cooed his plump little wife.\r\n\r\n"Tell me a story," said a young Dove, their son.\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush," said the Father Dove. "This is our son," he added, "and\r\nthis is his sister. We think them quite a pair. Our last brood, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Tell us a story," said the young Dove again.\r\n\r\n"Hush, dear. You mustn\'t tease the Swallow," said his mother. "They are\r\nso fond of stories," she cooed, "and they have heard that your family\r\nare great travellers."\r\n\r\n"But I want him to tell us a story," said the young Dove. "I think he\r\nmight."\r\n\r\nThis made the Swallow feel very uncomfortable, for he could see that the\r\nchildren had been badly brought up, and he did not want to tell a story\r\njust then.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you would like to hear about our journey south," said he. "Last\r\nfall, when the maples began to show red and yellow leaves among the\r\ngreen, we felt like flying away. It was quite warm weather, and the\r\nforest birds were still here, but when we feel like flying south we\r\nalways begin to get ready."\r\n\r\n"I never feel like flying south," said the young Dove. "I don\'t see why\r\nyou should."\r\n\r\n"That is because I am a Swallow and you are a farmyard Dove. We talked\r\nabout it to each other, and one day we were ready to start. We all had\r\non our new feathers and felt strong and well. We started out together,\r\nbut the young birds and their mothers could not keep up with the rest,\r\nso we went on ahead."\r\n\r\n"Ahead of whom?" said the young Dove, who had been preening his feathers\r\nwhen he should have been listening.\r\n\r\n"Ahead of the mothers and their fledglings. We flew over farms where\r\nthere were Doves like you; over rivers where the Wild Ducks were feeding\r\nby the shore; and over towns where crowds of boys and girls were going\r\ninto large buildings, while on top of these buildings were large bells\r\nsinging, \'Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong.\'"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that was a very pretty song," said the young Dove.\r\n\r\n"Hush," said his mother, "you mustn\'t interrupt the Swallow."\r\n\r\n"And at last we came to a great lake," said the Swallow. "It was so\r\ngreat that when we had flown over it for a little while we could not see\r\nland at all, and our eyes would not tell us which way to go. We just\r\nwent on as birds must in such places, flying as we felt we ought, and\r\nnot stopping to ask why or to wonder if we were right. Of course we\r\nSwallows never stop to eat, for we catch our food as we fly, but we did\r\nsometimes stop to rest. Just after we had crossed this great lake we\r\nalighted. It was then that a very queer thing happened, and this is\r\nreally the story that I started to tell."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said the young Dove and his sister. "How very exciting. But wait\r\njust a minute while we peep over the edge of the roof and see what the\r\nfarmer is doing." And before anybody could say a word they had pattered\r\naway to look.\r\n\r\nThe birds who were there say that the Swallow seemed quite disgusted,\r\nand surely nobody could blame him if he did.\r\n\r\n"You must excuse them," cooed their mother. "They are really hardly more\r\nthan Squabs yet, and I can\'t bear to speak severely to them. I\'m sure\r\nthey didn\'t mean to be rude."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly," said the Swallow. "I will excuse them and you\r\nmust excuse me. I wish to see a few of my old friends before the sun\r\ngoes down. Good afternoon!" And he darted away.\r\n\r\nThe young Doves came pattering back, swaying their heads as they walked.\r\n"Why, where is the Swallow?" they cried. "What made him go away? Right\r\nat the best part of the story, too. We don\'t see why folks are so\r\ndisagreeable. People never are as nice to us as they are to the other\r\nyoung Doves."\r\n\r\n"Hush," said their mother. "You mustn\'t talk in that way. Fly off for\r\nsomething to eat, and never mind about the rest of the story."\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone, she said to her husband, "I wonder if they did hurt\r\nthe Swallow\'s feelings? But then, they are so young, hardly more than\r\nSquabs."\r\n\r\nShe forgot that even Squabs should be thoughtful of others, and that no\r\nDove ever amounts to anything unless he begins in the right way as a\r\nSquab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAMB WITH THE LONGEST TAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sheep are a simple and kind-hearted family, and of all the people on\r\nthe farm there are none who are more loved than they. All summer they\r\nwander in the fields, nibbling the fresh, sweet grass, and resting at\r\nnoon in the shadow of the trees, but when the cold weather comes they\r\nare brought up to the farmyard and make their home in the long low\r\nSheep-shed.\r\n\r\nThat is always a happy time. The Horses breathe deeply and toss their\r\nheads for joy, the Cows say to each other, "Glad to have the Sheep come\r\nup," and even the Oxen shift their cuds and look long over their\r\nshoulders at the woolly newcomers. And this is not because the Sheep\r\ncan do anything for their neighbors to make them warm or to feed them.\r\nIt is only because they are a gentle folk and pleasant in all they say;\r\nand you know when people are always kind, it makes others happy just to\r\nsee them and have them near.\r\n\r\nThen, when the cold March winds are blowing, the good farmer brings more\r\nyellow straw into the Sheep-shed, and sees that it is warm and snug. If\r\nthere are any boards broken and letting the wind in, he mends them and\r\nshuts out the cold. At this time, too, the Horses and Cattle stop often\r\nin their eating to listen. Even the Pigs, who do not think much about\r\ntheir neighbors, root in the corners nearest the Sheep-shed and prick up\r\ntheir ears.\r\n\r\nSome bleak morning they hear a faint bleating and know that the first\r\nLamb is there. And then from day to day they hear more of the soft\r\nvoices as the new Lambs come to live with the flock. Such queer little\r\ncreatures as the Lambs are when they first come--so weak and awkward!\r\nThey can hardly stand alone, and stagger and wobble around the little\r\nrooms or pens where they are with their mothers. You can just imagine\r\nhow hard it must be to learn to manage four legs all at once!\r\n\r\nThere is one thing which they do learn very quickly, and that is, to\r\neat. They are hungry little people, and well they may be, for they have\r\nmuch growing to do, and all of the food that is to be made into good\r\nstout bodies and fine long wool has to go into their mouths and down\r\ntheir throats to their stomachs. It is very wonderful to think that a\r\nCow eats grass and it is turned into hair to keep her warm, a Goose eats\r\ngrass and grows feathers, and a Sheep eats grass and grows wool. Still,\r\nit is so, and nobody in the world can tell why. It is just one of the\r\nthings that are, and if you should ask "Why?" nobody could tell you the\r\nreason. There are many such things which we cannot understand, but there\r\nare many more which we can, so it would be very foolish for us to mind\r\nwhen there is no answer to our "Why?"\r\n\r\nYes, Sheep eat grass, and because they have such tiny mouths they have\r\nto take small mouthfuls. The Lambs have different food for a\r\nwhile,--warm milk from their mothers\' bodies. When a mother has a Lamb\r\nto feed, she eats a great deal, hay, grass, and chopped turnips, and\r\nthen part of the food that goes into her stomach is turned into milk and\r\nstored in two warm bags for the Lamb to take when he is hungry. And how\r\nthe Lambs do like this milk! It tastes so good that they can hardly\r\nstand still while they drink it down, and they give funny little jerks\r\nand wave their woolly tails in the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAMB WITH THE LONGEST TAIL.]\r\n\r\nThere was one Lamb who had a longer tail than any of the rest, and, sad\r\nto say, it made him rather vain. When he first came, he was too busy\r\ndrinking milk and learning to walk, to think about tails, but as he grew\r\nolder and stronger he began to know that he had the longest one. Because\r\nhe was a very young Lamb he was so foolish as to tease the others and\r\ncall out, "Baa! your tails are snippy ones!"\r\n\r\nThen the others would call back, "Baa! Don\'t care if they are!"\r\n\r\nAfter a while, his mother, who was a sensible Sheep and had seen much of\r\nlife, said to him: "You must not brag about your tail. It is very rude\r\nof you, and very silly too, for you have exactly such a tail as was\r\ngiven to you, and the other Lambs have exactly such tails as were given\r\nto them, and when you are older you will know that it did not matter in\r\nthe least what kind of tail you wore when you were little." She might\r\nhave told him something else, but she didn\'t.\r\n\r\nThe Lamb didn\'t dare to boast of his tail after this, but when he passed\r\nthe others, he would look at his mother, and if he thought she wouldn\'t\r\nsee, he would wiggle it at them. Of course that was just as bad as\r\ntalking about it, and the other Lambs knew perfectly well what he meant;\r\nstill, they pretended not to understand.\r\n\r\nOne morning, when his mother\'s back was turned, he was surprised to see\r\nthat she had only a short and stumpy tail. He had been thinking so much\r\nof his own that he had not noticed hers. "Mother," he cried, "why didn\'t\r\nyou have a long tail too?"\r\n\r\n"I did have once," she answered with a sheepish smile.\r\n\r\n"Did it get broken?" he asked in a faint little voice. He was thinking\r\nhow dreadful it would be if he should break his.\r\n\r\n"Not exactly," said his mother. "I will tell you all about it. All\r\nlittle Lambs have long tails----"\r\n\r\n"Not so long as mine, though," said he, interrupting.\r\n\r\n"No, not so long as yours," she replied, "but so long that if they were\r\nleft that way always they would make a great deal of trouble. As the\r\nwool grows on them, they would catch burrs and sharp, prickly things,\r\nwhich would pull the wool and sting the skin. The farmer knows this, so\r\nwhen the little Lambs are about as old as you are now, he and his men\r\nmake their tails shorter."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried the Lamb, curling his tail in as far between his legs as he\r\ncould, "do you mean that they will shorten my tail, my beautiful long\r\ntail?"\r\n\r\n"That is just what I mean," said his mother, "and you should be very\r\nglad of it. When that is done, you will be ready to go out into the\r\nfield with me. A lot of trouble we should have if the men did not look\r\nafter such things for us; but that is what men are for, they say,--to\r\nlook after us Sheep."\r\n\r\n"But won\'t they laugh at me when my tail is shorter?" asked her son.\r\n\r\n"They would laugh at you if you wore it long. No Lamb who pretends to be\r\nanybody would be seen in the pasture with a dangling tail. Only wild\r\nSheep wear them long, poor things!"\r\n\r\nNow the little Lamb wished that he had not boasted so much. Now, when\r\nthe others passed him, he did not put on airs. Now he wondered why they\r\ncouldn\'t have short tails in the beginning. He asked his uncle, an old\r\nWether Sheep, why this was and his uncle laughed. "Why, what would you\r\nhave done all these days if things happened in that way? What would you\r\nhave had to think about? What could you have talked about?" The little\r\nLamb hung his head and asked no more questions.\r\n\r\n"What do you think?" he called to a group of Lambs near by. "I\'m going\r\nto have one of the men shorten my tail. It is such a bother unless one\r\ndoes have it done, and mine is so very long!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WONDERFUL SHINY EGG\r\n\r\n\r\n"CUT-CUT-CA-DAH-CUT! Cut-cut-cut-ca-dah-cut!" called the Dorking Hen, as\r\nshe strutted around the poultry-yard. She held her head very high, and\r\npaused every few minutes to look around in her jerky way and see whether\r\nthe other fowls were listening. Once she even stood on her left foot\r\nright in the pathway of the Shanghai Cock, and cackled into his very\r\nears.\r\n\r\nEverybody pretended not to hear her. The people in the poultry-yard did\r\nnot like the Dorking Hen very well. They said that she put on airs.\r\nPerhaps she did. She certainly talked a great deal of the place from\r\nwhich she and the Dorking Cock came. They had come in a small cage from\r\na large poultry farm, and the Dorking Hen never tired of telling about\r\nthe wonderful, noisy ride that they took in a dark car drawn by a great,\r\nblack, snorting creature. She said that this creature\'s feet grew on to\r\nhis sides and whirled around as he ran, and that he breathed out of the\r\ntop of his head. When the fowls first heard of this, they were much\r\ninterested, but after a while they used to walk away from her, or make\r\nbelieve that they saw Grasshoppers whom they wanted to chase.\r\n\r\nWhen she found that people were not listening to her, she cackled louder\r\nthan ever, "Cut-cut-ca-dah-cut! Look at the egg--the egg--the egg--the\r\negg that I have laid."\r\n\r\n"Is there any particular reason why we should look at the egg--the\r\negg--the egg--the egg that you have laid?" asked the Shanghai Cock, who\r\nwas the grumpiest fowl in the yard.\r\n\r\nNow, usually if the Dorking Hen had been spoken to in this way, she\r\nwould have ruffled up her head feathers and walked away, but this time\r\nshe had news to tell and so she kept her temper. "Reason?" she cackled.\r\n"Yes indeed! It is the finest egg that was ever laid in this\r\npoultry-yard."\r\n\r\n"Hear her talk!" said a Bantam Hen. "I think it is in very poor taste to\r\nlay such large eggs as most of the Hens do here. Small ones are much\r\nmore genteel."\r\n\r\n"She must forget an egg that I laid a while ago with two yolks," said a\r\nShanghai Hen. "That was the largest egg ever laid here, and I have\r\nalways wished that I had hatched it. A pair of twin chickens would have\r\nbeen so interesting."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Dorking Hen, who could not keep still any longer,\r\n"small eggs may be genteel and large ones may be interesting, but my\r\nlast one is bee-autiful."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you\'d just as soon tell us about it as to brag without\r\ntelling?" grumbled the Shanghai Cock. "I suppose it is grass color, or\r\nsky color, or hay color, or speckled, like a sparrow\'s egg."\r\n\r\n"No," answered the Dorking Hen, "it is white, but it is shiny."\r\n\r\n"Shiny!" they exclaimed. "Who ever heard of a shiny egg?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody," she replied, "and that is why it is so wonderful."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t believe it," said the Shanghai Cock, as he turned away and began\r\nscratching the ground.\r\n\r\nNow the Dorking Hen did get angry. "Come to see it, if you don\'t believe\r\nme," she said, as she led the others into the Hen-house.\r\n\r\nShe flew up to the row of boxes where the Hens had their nests, and\r\npicked her way along daintily until she reached the farthest one. "Now\r\nlook," said she.\r\n\r\nOne by one the fowls peeped into the box, and sure enough, there it\r\nlay, a fine, shiny, white egg. The little Bantam, who was really a\r\njolly, kind-hearted creature, said, "Well, it is a beauty. I should be\r\nproud of it myself."\r\n\r\n"It is whiter than I fancy," said the Shanghai Cock, "but it certainly\r\ndoes shine."\r\n\r\n"I shall hatch it," said the Dorking Hen, very decidedly. "I shall hatch\r\nit and have a beautiful Chicken with shining feathers. I shall not hatch\r\nall the eggs in the nest, but roll this one away and sit on it."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said one of her friends, "somebody else may have laid it\r\nafter all, and not noticed. You know it is not the only one in the\r\nnest."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said the Dorking Hen. "I guess I know! I am sure it was not\r\nthere when I went to the nest and it was there when I left. I must have\r\nlaid it."\r\n\r\nThe fowls went away, and she tried to roll the shiny one away from the\r\nother eggs, but it was slippery and very light and would not stay where\r\nshe put it. Then she got out of patience and rolled all the others out\r\nof the nest. Two of them fell to the floor and broke, but she did not\r\ncare. "They are nothing but common ones, anyway," she said.\r\n\r\nWhen the farmer\'s wife came to gather the eggs she pecked at her and was\r\nvery cross. Every day she did this, and at last the woman let her alone.\r\nEvery-day she told the other fowls what a wonderful Chicken she expected\r\nto have. "Of course he will be of my color," said she, "but his feathers\r\nwill shine brightly. He will be a great flyer, too. I am sure that is\r\nwhat it means when the egg is light." She came off the nest each day\r\njust long enough to stroll around and chat with her friends, telling\r\nthem what wonderful things she expected, and never letting them forget\r\nthat it was she who had laid the shiny egg. She pecked airily at the\r\nfood, and seemed to think that a Hen who was hatching such a wonderful\r\nChicken should have the best of everything. Each day she told some new\r\nbeauty that was to belong to her child, until the Shanghai Cock fairly\r\nflapped his wings with impatience.\r\n\r\nDay after day passed, and the garden beyond the barn showed rows of\r\nsturdy green plants, where before there had been only straight ridges of\r\nfine brown earth. The Swallows who were building under the eaves of the\r\ngreat barn, twittered and chattered of the wild flowers in the forest,\r\nand four other Hens came off their nests with fine broods of downy\r\nChickens. And still the Dorking Hen sat on her shiny egg and told what a\r\nwonderful Chicken she expected to hatch. This was not the only egg in\r\nthe nest now, but it was the only one of which she spoke.\r\n\r\nAt last a downy Chicken peeped out of one of the common eggs, and\r\nwriggled and twisted to free himself from the shell. His mother did not\r\nhurry him or help him. She knew that he must not slip out of it until\r\nall the blood from the shell-lining had run into his tender little body.\r\nIf she had pushed the shell off before he had all of this fine red\r\nblood, he would not have been a strong Chicken, and she wanted her\r\nchildren to be strong.\r\n\r\nThe Dorking Cock walked into the Hen-house and stood around on one foot.\r\nHe came to see if the shiny egg had hatched, but he wouldn\'t ask. He\r\nthought himself too dignified to show any interest in newly hatched\r\nChickens before a Hen. Still, he saw no harm in standing around on one\r\nfoot and letting the Dorking Hen talk to him if she wanted to. When she\r\ntold him it was one of the common eggs that had hatched, he was quite\r\ndisgusted, and stalked out of doors without a word.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that he had been rather bragging to the other Cocks, and\r\nonly a few minutes later he spoke with pride of the time when "our"\r\nshiny egg should hatch. "For," he said, "Mrs. Dorking and I have been\r\nquite alone here as far as our own people are concerned. It is not\r\nstrange that we should feel a great pride in the wonderful egg and the\r\nChicken to be hatched from it. A Dorking is a Dorking after all, my\r\nfriends." And he flapped his wings, stretched his neck, and crowed as\r\nloudly as he could.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Black Spanish Cock afterward, "a Dorking certainly is a\r\nDorking, although I never could see the sense of making such a fuss\r\nabout it. They are fat and they have an extra toe on each foot. Why\r\nshould a fowl want extra toes? I have four on each foot, and I can\r\nscratch up all the food I want with them."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the grumpy old Shanghai Cock, "I am sick and tired of this\r\nfuss. Common eggs are good enough for Shanghais and Black Spanish and\r\nBantams, and I should think----"\r\n\r\nJust at this minute they heard a loud fluttering and squawking in the\r\nHen-house and the Dorking Hen crying, "Weasel! Weasel!" The Cocks ran to\r\ndrive the Weasel away, and the Hens followed to see it done. All was\r\nnoise and hurry, and they saw nothing of the Weasel except the tip of\r\nhis bushy tail as he drew his slender body through an opening in the\r\nfence.\r\n\r\nThe Dorking Hen was on one of the long perches where the fowls roost at\r\nnight, the newly hatched Chicken lay shivering in the nest, and on the\r\nfloor were the pieces of the wonderful shiny egg. The Dorking Hen had\r\nknocked it from the nest in her flight.\r\n\r\nThe Dorking Cock looked very cross. He was not afraid of a Weasel, and\r\nhe did not see why she should be. "Just like a Hen!" he said.\r\n\r\nThe Black Spanish Hen turned to him before he could say another word.\r\n"Just like a Cock!" she exclaimed. "I never raise Chickens myself. It is\r\nnot the custom among the Black Spanish Hens. We lay the eggs and\r\nsomebody else hatches them. But if I had been on the nest as long as\r\nMrs. Dorking has, do you suppose I\'d let any fowl speak to me as you\r\nspoke to her? I\'d--I\'d--" and she was so angry that she couldn\'t say\r\nanother word, but just strutted up and down and cackled.\r\n\r\nA motherly old Shanghai Hen flew up beside Mrs. Dorking. "We are very\r\nsorry for you," she said. "I know how I should have felt if I had broken\r\nmy two-yolked egg just as it was ready to hatch."\r\n\r\nThe Bantam Hen picked her way to the nest. "What a dear little Chicken!"\r\nshe cried, in her most comforting tone. "He is so plump and so bright\r\nfor his age. But, my dear, he is chilly, and I think you should cuddle\r\nhim under your wings until his down is dry."\r\n\r\nThe Dorking Hen flew down. "He is a dear," she said, "and yet when he\r\nwas hatched I didn\'t care much for him, because I had thought so long\r\nabout the shiny egg. It serves me right to lose that one, because I have\r\nbeen so foolish. Still, I do not know how I could stand it if it were\r\nnot for my good neighbors."\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Dorking was talking with the Bantam by her nest, the Black\r\nSpanish Hen scratched a hole in the earth under the perches, poked the\r\npieces of the shiny egg into it, and covered them up. "I never raise\r\nChickens myself," she said, "but if I did----"\r\n\r\nThe Shanghai Cock walked away with the Dorking Cock. "I\'m sorry for\r\nyou," he said, "and I am more sorry for Mrs. Dorking. She is too fine a\r\nHen to be spoken to as you spoke to her this morning, and I don\'t want\r\nto hear any more of your fault-finding. Do you understand?" And he\r\nruffled his neck feathers and stuck his face close to that of the\r\nDorking Cock. They stared into each other\'s eyes for a minute; then the\r\nDorking Cock, who was not so big and strong as the Shanghai, shook his\r\nhead and answered sweetly, "It was rude of me. I won\'t do it again."\r\n\r\nFrom that day to this, nobody in the poultry yard has ever spoken of the\r\nshiny egg, and the Dorkings are much liked by the other fowls. Yet if it\r\nhad not been for her trouble, Mrs. Dorking and her neighbors would never\r\nhave become such good friends. The little Dorkings are fine,\r\nfat-breasted Chicks, with the extra toe on each foot of which all that\r\nfamily are so proud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUCKLING WHO DIDN\'T KNOW WHAT TO DO\r\n\r\n\r\n"Quack! Quack!" called the Duck who had been sitting on her nest so\r\nlong. "My first egg is cracked, and I can see the broad yellow bill of\r\nmy eldest child. Ah! Now I can see his downy white head." The Drake\r\nheard her and quacked the news to every one around, and flapped his\r\nwings, and preened his feathers, for was not this the first Duckling\r\never hatched on the farm?\r\n\r\nThe Drake had not been there long himself. It was only a few days before\r\nthe Duck began sitting that she and her five sisters had come with him\r\nto this place. It had not taken them long to become acquainted with the\r\nother farmyard people, and all had been kind to them. The Geese had\r\nrather put on airs, at first, because they were bigger and had longer\r\nlegs, but the Ducks and Drake were too wise to notice this in any way,\r\nand before long the Geese were as friendly as possible. They would have\r\nshown the Ducks the way to the water if it had been necessary, but it\r\nwas not, for Ducks always know without being told just where to find it.\r\nThey know, and they do not know why they know. It is one of the things\r\nthat are.\r\n\r\nNow that the first Duckling had chipped the shell, everybody wanted to\r\nsee him, and there was soon a crowd of fowls around the nest watching\r\nhim free himself from it. The Drake stood by, as proud as a Peacock. "I\r\nthink he looks much like his mother," said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," cackled all the Hens. "The same broad yellow bill, the same\r\nshort yellow legs, and the same webbed feet."\r\n\r\nThe mother Duck smiled. "He looks more like me now than he will by and\r\nby," she said, "for when his feathers grow and cover the down, he will\r\nhave a stiff little one curled up on his back like the Drake\'s. And\r\nreally, except for the curled feather, his father and I look very much\r\nalike."\r\n\r\n"That is so," said the Black Spanish Cock. "You do look alike; the same\r\nwhite feathers, the same broad breast, the same strong wings, the same\r\npointed tail, the same long neck, the same sweet expression around the\r\nbill!" That was just like the Black Spanish Cock. He always said\r\nsomething pleasant about people when he could, and it was much better\r\nthan saying unpleasant things. Indeed, he was the most polite fowl in\r\nthe poultry-yard, and the Black Spanish Hen thought his manners quite\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nThen the Duckling\'s five aunts pushed their way through the crowd to the\r\nnest under the edge of the strawstack. "Have you noticed what fine\r\nlarge feet he has?" said one of them. "That is like his mother\'s people.\r\nSee what a strong web is between the three long toes on each foot! He\r\nwill be a good swimmer. The one toe that points backward is small, to be\r\nsure, but he does not need that in swimming. That is only to make\r\nwaddling easier."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," "A fine web," and "Very large feet," cried the fowls around\r\nthe nest, but most of them didn\'t care so much about the size of his\r\nfeet as the Ducks did. Large feet are always useful, you know, yet\r\nnobody needs them so badly as Geese and Ducks. The Geese were off\r\nswimming, and so could not see the Duckling when first he came out of\r\nthe shell.\r\n\r\n"Tap-tap, tap-tap," sounded inside another shell, and they knew that\r\nthere would soon be a second damp little Duckling beside the first. The\r\nvisitors could not stay to see this one come out, and they went away\r\nfor a time. The eldest Duckling had supposed that this was life, to have\r\npeople around saying, "How bright he is!" "What fine legs!" or "He has a\r\nbeautiful bill!" And now that they all walked away and his mother was\r\nlooking after the Duckling who was just breaking her shell, he didn\'t\r\nlike it--he didn\'t like it at all.\r\n\r\nStill, it was much better so. If he had had no brothers and sisters, he\r\nwould have been a lonely little fellow; besides, he would have had his\r\nown way nearly all the time, and that is likely to make any Duckling\r\nselfish. Then, too, if all the other fowls had petted him and given him\r\nthe best of everything, he would have become vain. Truly, it was a good\r\nthing for him not to be the only child, and he soon learned to think so.\r\n\r\nAfter there were two Ducklings, a third one came, and a fourth, and a\r\nfifth, and so on until, when the broken shells were cleared away and\r\nthe mother had counted bills, she could call to the Drake and her\r\nsisters, "Nine Ducklings hatched, and there were only nine eggs in the\r\nnest."\r\n\r\n"Then come to the brook," said the Drake, "and let the children have a\r\nbath. I have been swimming a great many times to-day, and they have not\r\neven set foot in water yet. Why, our eldest son was out of his shell\r\nbefore the Horses were harnessed this morning, and here it is nearly\r\ntime for their supper."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t help it," said the mother Duck. "I couldn\'t leave the nest\r\nto take him swimming until the rest were ready to go. I am doing the\r\nbest I can."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to find fault," said the Drake, "and I suppose you\r\ncouldn\'t get away, but we know that Ducklings should be taught to bathe\r\noften, and there is nothing like beginning in time."\r\n\r\n"I might have taken some of them to the brook," said one of the aunts.\r\nThe mother straightened her neck and held her head very high, while she\r\nanswered, "You? You are very kind, but what do you know about bringing\r\nup Ducklings?"\r\n\r\nNow the aunt might have said, "I know just as much as you do," for it\r\nwas the young mother\'s first brood, yet she kept still. She thought, "I\r\nmay hatch Ducklings of my own some day, and then I suppose I shall want\r\nto care for them myself."\r\n\r\n"Wait," said the Drake, as they reached the brook. "Let us wait and see\r\nwhat the children will do." The words were hardly out of his bill\r\nwhen--flutter--splash--splash!--there were nine yellow-white Ducklings\r\nfloating on the brook and murmuring happily to each other as though they\r\nhad never done anything else.\r\n\r\nThe Dorking Cock stood on the bank. "Who taught them to swim?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Nobody," answered their mother proudly. "They knew without being told.\r\nThat is the way a Duck takes to water." And she gave a dainty lurch and\r\nwas among her brood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEY HAD A GOOD SWIM.]\r\n\r\n"Well!" exclaimed the Dorking Cock. "I thought the little Dorkings were\r\nas bright as children could be, but they didn\'t know as much as that. I\r\nmust tell them." He stalked off, talking under his breath.\r\n\r\n"They know more than that," said the Drake. "Did you see how they ran\r\nahead of us when we stopped to talk? They knew where to find water as\r\nsoon as they were out of the shell. Still, the Cock might not have\r\nbelieved that if I had told him."\r\n\r\nThey had a good swim, and then all stood on the bank and dried\r\nthemselves. This they did by squeezing the water out of their down with\r\ntheir bills. The Drake, the mother Duck, the five aunts, and the nine\r\nDucklings all stood as tall and straight as they could, and turned and\r\ntwisted their long necks, and flapped their wings, and squeezed their\r\ndown, and murmured to each other. And their father didn\'t tell the\r\nlittle ones how, and their mother didn\'t tell them how, and their five\r\naunts didn\'t tell them how, but they knew without being told.\r\n\r\nThe Ducklings grew fast, and made friends of all the farmyard people.\r\nEarly every morning they went to the brook. They learned to follow the\r\nbrook to the river, and here were wonderful things to be seen. There was\r\nplenty to eat, too, in the soft mud under the water, and it was easy\r\nenough to dive to it, or to reach down their long necks while only their\r\npointed tails and part of their body could be seen above the water. Not\r\nthat they ate the mud. They kept only the food that they found in it,\r\nand then let the mud slip out between the rough edges of their bills.\r\nThey swam and ate all day, and slept all night, and were dutiful\r\nDucklings who minded their mother, so it was not strange that they were\r\nplump and happy.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a morning when the eldest Duckling could not go to\r\nthe brook with the others. A Weasel had bitten him in the night, and if\r\nit had not been for his mother and the Drake, would have carried him\r\naway. The rest had to go in swimming, and his lame leg would not let him\r\nwaddle as far as the brook, or swim after he got there.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what to do," he said to his mother. "I can\'t swim and I\r\ncan\'t waddle far, and I\'ve eaten so much already that I can\'t eat\r\nanything more for a long, long time."\r\n\r\n"You might play with the little Shanghais," said his mother.\r\n\r\n"They run around too much," he replied. "I can\'t keep up with them."\r\n\r\n"Then why not lie near the corn crib and visit with the Mice?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they don\'t like the things that I like, and it isn\'t any fun."\r\n\r\n"How would it suit you to watch the Peacock for a while?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m tired of watching the Peacock."\r\n\r\n"Then," said the mother, "you must help somebody else. You are old\r\nenough to think of such things now, and you must remember this wise\r\nsaying: \'When you don\'t know what to do, help somebody.\'"\r\n\r\n"Whom can I help?" said the lame Duckling. "People can all do things for\r\nthemselves."\r\n\r\n"There is the Blind Horse," answered his mother. "He is alone to-day,\r\nand I\'m sure he would like somebody to visit him."\r\n\r\n"Quack!" said the Duckling. "I will go to see him." He waddled slowly\r\naway, stopping now and then to rest, and shaking his little pointed tail\r\nfrom side to side as Ducks do. The Blind Horse was grazing in the\r\npasture alone.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come to see you, sir," said the Duckling. "Shall I be in your\r\nway?"\r\n\r\nThe Blind Horse looked much pleased. "I think from your voice that you\r\nmust be one of the young Ducks," said he. "I shall be very glad to have\r\nyou visit me, only you must be careful to keep away from my feet, for I\r\ncan\'t see, and I might step on you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be careful," said the Duckling. "I can\'t waddle much anyway this\r\nmorning, because my leg hurts me so."\r\n\r\n"Why, I\'m sorry you are lame," said the Horse. "What is the matter?"\r\n\r\n"A Weasel bit me in the night, sir. But it doesn\'t hurt so much as it\r\ndid before I came to see you. Perhaps the pasture is a better place for\r\nlame legs than the farmyard." He didn\'t know that it was because he was\r\ntrying to make somebody else happy that he felt so much better, yet that\r\nwas the reason.\r\n\r\nThe Blind Horse and the Duckling became very fond of each other and had\r\na fine time. The Horse told stories of his Colthood, and of the things\r\nhe had seen in his travels before he became blind. And the Duckling told\r\nhim what the other farmyard people were doing, and about the soft,\r\nfleecy clouds that drifted across the blue sky. When the mother Duck\r\ncame to look for him, the little fellow was much surprised. "Didn\'t you\r\ngo to the brook?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said his mother, with a smile. "We have been there all the\r\nmorning. Don\'t you see how high the sun is?"\r\n\r\n"Why-ee!" said the Duckling. "I didn\'t think I had been here long at\r\nall. We\'ve been having the nicest time. And I\'m coming again, am I not?"\r\nHe asked this question of the Blind Horse.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would come often," answered the Blind Horse. "You have given\r\nme a very pleasant morning. Good-bye!"\r\n\r\nThe mother Duck and her son waddled off together. "How is your leg?"\r\nsaid she.\r\n\r\n"I forgot all about it until I began to walk," answered the Duckling.\r\n"Isn\'t that queer?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said his mother. "It was because you were making somebody\r\nelse happy. \'When you don\'t know what to do, help somebody.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUSSY QUEEN BEE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a sheltered corner of the farmyard, where the hedge kept off the cold\r\nwinds and the trees shaded from hot summer sunshine, there were many\r\nhives of Bees. One could not say much for the Drones, but the others\r\nwere the busiest of all the farmyard people, and they had so much to do\r\nthat they did not often stop to visit with their neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn each hive, or home, there were many thousand Bees, and each had his\r\nown work. First of all, there was the Queen. You might think that being\r\na Queen meant playing all the time, but that is not so, for to be a\r\nreally good Queen, even in a Beehive, one must know a great deal and\r\nkeep at work all the time. The Queen Bee is the mother of all the Bee\r\nBabies, and she spends her days in laying eggs. She is so very precious\r\nand important a person that the first duty of the rest is to take care\r\nof her.\r\n\r\nThe Drones are the stoutest and finest-looking of all the Bees, but they\r\nare lazy, very, very lazy. There are never many of them in a hive, and\r\nlike most lazy people, they spend much of their time in telling the\r\nothers how to work. They do not make wax or store honey, and as the\r\nWorker Bees do not wish them to eat what has been put away for winter,\r\nthey do not live very long.\r\n\r\nMost of the Bees are Workers. They are smaller than either the Queen\r\nMother or the Drones, and they gather all the honey, make all the wax,\r\nbuild the comb, and feed the babies. They keep the hive clean, and when\r\nthe weather is very warm, some of them fan the air with their wings to\r\ncool it. They guard the doorway of the hive, too, and turn away the\r\nrobbers who sometimes come to steal their honey.\r\n\r\nIn these busy homes, nobody can live long just for himself. Everybody\r\nhelps somebody else, and that makes life pleasant. The Queen Mother\r\noften lays as many as two thousand eggs in a day. Most of these are\r\nWorker eggs, and are laid in the small cells of the brood comb, which is\r\nthe nursery of the hive. A few are Drone eggs and are laid in large\r\ncells. She never lays any Queen eggs, for she does not want more Queens\r\ngrowing up. It is a law among the Bees that there can be only one grown\r\nQueen living in each home.\r\n\r\nThe Workers, however, know that something might happen to their old\r\nQueen Mother, so, after she has gone away, they sometimes go into a cell\r\nwhere she has laid a Worker egg, and take down the waxen walls between\r\nit and the ones on either side to make a very large royal cell. They\r\nbite away the wax with their strong jaws and press the rough edges into\r\nshape with their feet. When this egg hatches, they do not feed the baby,\r\nor Larva, with tasteless bread made of flower-dust, honey, and water, as\r\nthey would if they intended it to grow up a Worker or a Drone. Instead,\r\nthey make what is called royal jelly, which is quite sour, and tuck this\r\nall around the Larva, who now looks like a little white worm.\r\n\r\nThe royal jelly makes her grow fast, and in five days she is so large as\r\nto nearly fill the cell. Then she stops eating, spins a cocoon, and lies\r\nin it for about two and a half days more. When she comes out of this,\r\nshe is called a Pupa. Sixteen days after the laying of the egg, the\r\nyoung Queen is ready to come out of her cell. It takes twenty-one days\r\nfor a Worker to become fully grown and twenty-five for a Drone.\r\n\r\nIn the hive by the cedar tree, the Queen Mother was growing restless\r\nand fussy. She knew that the Workers were raising some young Queens, and\r\nshe tried to get to the royal cells. She knew that if she could only do\r\nthat, the young Queens would never live to come out. The Workers knew\r\nthis, too, and whenever she came near there, they made her go away.\r\n\r\nThe Queen Larv\xc3\xa6 and Pup\xc3\xa6 were of different ages, and one of them was now\r\nready to leave her cell. They could hear her crying to be let out, but\r\nthey knew that if she and the Queen Mother should meet now, one of them\r\nwould die. So instead of letting her out, they built a thick wall of wax\r\nover the door and left only an opening through which they could feed\r\nher. When she was hungry she ran her tongue out and they put honey on\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShe wondered why the Workers did not let her out, when she wanted so\r\nmuch to be free. She did not yet know that Queen Mothers do not get\r\nalong well with young Queens.\r\n\r\nThe Workers talked it over by themselves. One of them was very\r\ntender-hearted. "It does seem too bad," said she, "to keep the poor\r\nyoung Queen shut up in her cell. I don\'t see how you can stand it to\r\nhear her piping so pitifully all the time. I am sure she must be\r\nbeautiful. I never saw a finer tongue than the one she runs out for\r\nhoney."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said a sensible old Worker, who had seen many Queens hatched\r\nand many swarms fly away, "you\'d be a good deal more sorry if we did let\r\nher out now. It would not do at all."\r\n\r\nThe tender-hearted Worker did not answer this, but she talked it over\r\nwith the Drones. "I declare," said she, wiping her eyes with her\r\nforefeet, "I can hardly gather a mouthful of honey for thinking of her."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you hang yourself up and make wax then," said one Drone. "It\r\nis a rather sunshiny day, but you ought to be doing something, and if\r\nyou cannot gather honey you might do that." This was just like a Drone.\r\nHe never gathered honey or made wax, yet he could not bear to see a\r\nWorker lose any time.\r\n\r\nThe Worker did not hang herself up and make wax, however. She never did\r\nthat except on cloudy days, and she was one of those Bees who seem to\r\nthink that nothing will come out right unless they stop working to see\r\nabout it. There was plenty waiting to be done, but she was too sad and\r\nanxious to do it. She might have known that since her friends were only\r\nminding the law, it was right to keep the new Queen in her cell.\r\n\r\nThe Queen Mother was restless and fussy. She could not think of her\r\nwork, and half the time she did not know whether she was laying a Drone\r\negg or a Worker egg. In spite of that, she did not make any mistake, or\r\nput one into the wrong kind of cell. "I cannot stay here with a young\r\nQueen," said she. "I will not stay here. I will take my friends with me\r\nand fly away."\r\n\r\nWhenever she met a Worker, she struck her feelers on those of her\r\nfriend, and then this friend knew exactly how she felt about it. In this\r\nway the news was passed around, and soon many of the Workers were as\r\nrestless as their Queen Mother. They were so excited over it at times\r\nthat the air of the hive grew very hot. After a while they would become\r\nquiet and gather honey once more. They whispered often to each other.\r\n"Do you know where we are going?" one said.\r\n\r\n"Sh!" was the answer. "The guides are looking for a good place now."\r\n\r\n"I wish the Queen Mother knew where we are going," said the first.\r\n\r\n"How could she?" replied the second. "You know very well that she has\r\nnot left the hive since she began to lay eggs. Here she comes now."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear!" exclaimed the Queen Mother. "I can never stand this. I\r\ncertainly cannot. To think I am not allowed to rule in my own hive! The\r\nWorkers who are guarding the royal cells drive me away whenever I go\r\nnear them. I will not stay any longer."\r\n\r\n"Then," said a Drone, as though he had thought of it for the first time,\r\n"why don\'t you go away?"\r\n\r\n"I shall," said she. "Will you go with me?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the Drone. "I hate moving and furnishing a new house.\r\nBesides, somebody must stay here to take care of the Workers and the\r\nyoung Queen."\r\n\r\nThe Queen Mother walked away. "When we were both young," she said to\r\nherself, "he would have gone anywhere with me."\r\n\r\nAnd the Drone said to himself, "Now, isn\'t that just like a Queen\r\nMother! She has known all the time that there would be young Queens\r\ncoming on, and that she would have to leave, yet here she is, making the\r\nbiggest kind of fuss about it. She ought to remember that it is the\r\nlaw."\r\n\r\nIndeed she should have remembered that it was the law, for everything is\r\ndone by law in the hive, and no one person should find fault. The law\r\nlooks after them all, and will not let any one have more than his\r\nrightful share.\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon there was a sudden quiet in their home. The Workers\r\nwho had been outside returned and visited with the rest. While they were\r\nwaiting, a few who were to be their guides came to the door of the hive,\r\nstruck their wings together, and gave the signal for starting. Then all\r\nwho were going with the Queen Mother hurried out of the door and flew\r\nwith her in circles overhead. "Good-bye!" they called. "Raise all the\r\nyoung Queens you wish. We shall never come back. We are going far, far\r\naway, and we shall not tell you where. It is a lovely place, a very\r\nlovely place."\r\n\r\n"Let them go," said the Drones who stayed behind. "Now, isn\'t it time to\r\nlet out the young Queen?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet," answered a Worker, who stood near the door. "Not one feeler\r\nshall she put outside her cell until that swarm is out of sight."\r\n\r\nThe tender-hearted Worker came up wiping her eyes. "Oh, that poor Queen\r\nMother!" said she. "I am so sorry for her. I positively cannot gather\r\nhoney to-day, I feel so badly about her going."\r\n\r\n"Better keep on working," said her friend. "It\'s the best thing in the\r\nworld for that sad feeling. Besides, you should try to keep strong."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I will try to eat something from the comb," was the answer, "but I\r\ndon\'t feel like working."\r\n\r\n"Zzzt!" said the other Worker. "I think if you can eat, you can hunt\r\nyour food outside, and not take honey we have laid up for winter or food\r\nthat will be needed for the children."\r\n\r\nThe Drones chuckled. It was all right for them to be lazy, they thought,\r\nbut they never could bear to see a Worker waste time. "Ah," cried one of\r\nthem suddenly, "what is the new swarm doing now?"\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when the Queen Mother crawled\r\ninto the hive again. "Such dreadful luck!" said she. "A cloud passed\r\nover the sun just as we were alighting on a tree to rest."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t have come back for that," said a Drone.\r\n\r\n"No," said she, in her airiest way, "I dare say you wouldn\'t, but I\r\nwould. I dare not go to a new home after a cloud has passed over the\r\nsun. I think it is a sign of bad luck. I should never expect a single\r\negg to hatch if I went on. We shall try it again to-morrow."\r\n\r\nAll the others came back with her, and the hive was once more crowded\r\nand hot. "Oh dear!" said the tender-hearted Worker, "isn\'t it too bad to\r\nthink they couldn\'t go?"\r\n\r\nThe next morning they started again and were quite as excited over it as\r\nbefore. The Queen Mother had fussed and fidgeted all the time, although\r\nshe had laid nine hundred and seventy-three eggs while waiting, and that\r\nin spite of interruptions. "Being busy keeps me from thinking," said\r\nshe, "and I must do something." This time the Queen Mother lighted on an\r\napple-tree branch, and the others clung to her until all who had left\r\nthe hive were in a great mass on the branch,--a mass as large as a small\r\ncabbage. They meant to rest a little while and then fly away to the new\r\nhome chosen by their guides.\r\n\r\nWhile they were hanging here, the farmer came under the tree, carrying\r\na long pole with a wire basket fastened to the upper end. He shook the\r\nclustered Bees gently into it, and then changed them into an empty hive\r\nthat stood beside their old home.\r\n\r\n"Now," said the Workers who had stayed in the old hive, "we will let out\r\nthe new Queen, for the Queen Mother will never return."\r\n\r\nIt did not take long to bite away the waxen wall and let her out. Then\r\nthey gathered around and caressed her, and touched their feelers to her\r\nand waited upon her, and explained why they could not let her out\r\nsooner. She was still a soft gray color, like all young Bees when they\r\nfirst come from the cell, but this soon changed to the black worn by her\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe Workers flew in and out, and brought news from the hive next door.\r\nThey could not go there, for the law does not allow a Bee who lives in\r\none home to visit in another, but they met their old friends in the air\r\nor when they were sipping honey. They found that the Queen Mother had\r\nquite given up the idea of living elsewhere and was as busy as ever. The\r\nfarmer had put a piece of comb into the new hive so that she could begin\r\nhousekeeping at once.\r\n\r\nThe new Queen was petted and kept at home until she was strong and used\r\nto moving about. That was not long. Then she said she wanted to see the\r\nworld outside. "We will go with you," said the Drones, who were always\r\nglad of an excuse for flying away in pleasant weather. They said there\r\nwas so much noise and hurrying around in the hive that they could never\r\nget any real rest there during the daytime.\r\n\r\nSo the young Queen flew far away and saw the beautiful world for the\r\nfirst time. Such a blue sky! Such green grass! Such fine trees covered\r\nwith sweet-smelling blossoms! She loved it all as soon as she saw it.\r\n"Ah," she cried, "what a wonderful thing it is to live and see all this!\r\nI am so glad that I was hatched. But now I must hurry home, for there is\r\nso much to be done."\r\n\r\nShe was a fine young Queen, and the Bees were all proud of her. They let\r\nher do anything she wished as long as she kept away from the royal\r\ncells. She soon began to work as the old Queen Mother had done, and was\r\nvery happy in her own way. She would have liked to open the royal cells\r\nand prevent more Queens from hatching, and when they told her it was the\r\nlaw which made them keep her away, she still wanted to bite into them.\r\n\r\n"That poor young Queen Mother!" sighed the tender-hearted Worker. "I am\r\nso sorry for her when she is kept away from the royal cells. This is a\r\nsad, sad world!" But this isn\'t a sad world by any means. It is a\r\nbeautiful, sunshiny, happy world, and neither Queen Bees nor anybody\r\nelse should think it hard if they cannot do every single thing they\r\nwish. The law looks after great and small, and there is no use in\r\npouting because we cannot do one certain thing, when there is any amount\r\nof delightful work and play awaiting us. And the young Queen Mother knew\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAY COLT LEARNS TO MIND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe span of Bays were talking together in their stalls, and the other\r\nHorses were listening. That was one trouble with living in the barn, you\r\ncould not say anything to your next-door neighbor without somebody else\r\nhearing. The farmer had solid walls between the stalls, with openings so\r\nfar back that no Horse could get his head to them without breaking his\r\nhalter. This had been done to keep them from biting each other, and as\r\nnobody but the Dappled Gray ever thought of doing such a thing, it was\r\nrather hard on the rest. It made it difficult for the mothers to bring\r\nup their children properly, for after a Colt was old enough to have a\r\nstall to himself, his mother had to call out her advice and warnings so\r\nloudly that everybody could hear, and you know it is not well to reprove\r\na child before company if it can be helped. Indeed, it was this very\r\nquestion that was troubling the span of Bays now. Each of them had a\r\ntwo-year-old Colt, and they knew that it was nearly time for the farmer\r\nto put these Colts to work. The span of Bays were sisters, so of course\r\ntheir children were cousins, and they were all very fond of each other\r\nand of the Blind Horse, who was the uncle of the Bays and the\r\ngreat-uncle of the Bay Colt and the Gray Colt.\r\n\r\n"I am worried about the Bay Colt," said his mother. "Since he was\r\nbrought into the barn last fall and had a stall away from me, he has\r\ngotten into bad ways. I have told him again and again that he must not\r\nnibble the edge of the manger, yet the first thing I heard this morning\r\nwas the grating of his teeth on the wood."\r\n\r\n"Well," said his aunt, "you know he is teething, and that may be the\r\nreason."\r\n\r\n"That is no excuse," said his mother sternly. "He has been teething ever\r\nsince he was five days old, and he will not cut his last tooth for three\r\nyears yet. I don\'t call it goodness to keep from cribbing when you don\'t\r\nwant to crib, and the time to stop is now. Besides, if he waits until he\r\nhas all his teeth, he won\'t be able to break himself of the habit when\r\nhe does try."\r\n\r\n"That is so," said his aunt, "and he will ruin his teeth, too."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" exclaimed the Bay Colt, who had heard what they were saying. "I\r\ncan stop whenever I want to, and they\'re my own teeth, anyway. It isn\'t\r\nanybody else\'s business if I do ruin them."\r\n\r\n"There!" said his mother to his aunt, "you see what I mean. That is just\r\nthe way he talks all the time. Now what would you do?"\r\n\r\n"Let him alone," snorted the Dappled Gray. "Let him alone, and he will\r\nget some Horse sense after he has been broken. He\'ll have a hard time of\r\nit, but he\'ll come out all right."\r\n\r\nThe Bay Colt kicked against the side of the stall, he was so vexed.\r\n"I\'ll thank you to let me alone," said he. "I don\'t see why everybody\r\ntells me what I ought to do. Guess I know a thing or two."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you why," said the Dappled Gray, in a voice that sounded as\r\nthough he were trying very hard not to lose his temper. "It is because\r\nyou are young and we like you, and we can save you trouble if you mind\r\nwhat we tell you. I had lost the black pits in my front teeth before you\r\nwere born, and when a Horse has lived long enough to lose the black pits\r\nfrom his front teeth, he knows a good deal. You don\'t know a curb-bit\r\nfrom a snaffle now, but you will learn many things when you are\r\nbroken--a very great many things."\r\n\r\nThe Bay Colt tossed his head and did not answer. When he was led out to\r\ndrink, the Dappled Gray spoke quickly to his friends. "We will let him\r\nalone," said he, "as he wishes. We will not advise him until he asks us\r\nto do so." They were all whinnying "Yes" when the Bay Colt came back.\r\nThen it became so still that you could have heard a stem of hay drop.\r\n\r\nFor a few days after this, the Bay Colt had a very good time. Nobody\r\ngave him any advice, and even when he gnawed at the edge of the manger,\r\nhis mother did not seem to notice it. After he found that she didn\'t say\r\nanything, he didn\'t gnaw, or crib, so much. He was such a foolish and\r\ncontrary young fellow that when people told him not to do a thing, he\r\nalways wanted to do that thing worse than anything else in the world.\r\nHis cousin, the Gray Colt, was not at all like him. She was a gentle\r\nlittle two-year-old whom everybody loved. She was full of fun and was\r\nthe gayest possible companion in the meadow, yet when the older Horses\r\ngave her advice, she always listened and obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe Bay Colt was very fond of his cousin, but he did like to tease her,\r\nand once in the fall, before they came to stay in the barn, he called\r\nher a "goody-goody" because she wouldn\'t jump the fence and run away\r\nwith him. He said she wouldn\'t do such things because she didn\'t know\r\nwhat fun was. Then she did show that she had a temper, for her brown\r\neyes snapped and her soft lips were raised until she showed all her\r\nbiting teeth. "I\'m not a \'goody-goody,\'" she cried, stamping the ground\r\nwith her pretty little hoofs, "and I just ache to go. I feel as though\r\nthere were ropes that I couldn\'t see, pulling me toward that fence\r\nevery time I think of it, but I won\'t go! I won\'t go! My mother says\r\nthat she jumped a fence and ran away when she was a Colt, and that she\r\nfelt as mean as could be afterward."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said her cousin, "I\'m going anyway, and you can stay at\r\nhome if you want to. Good-bye!" He ran and leaped over the fence, and\r\ntrotted down the road with his head well up and his tail in the air. And\r\nthen how the Gray Colt did want to follow! "I won\'t!" she said again. "I\r\nwon\'t do it. I\'ll look the other way and try to forget it, but I wish he\r\nknew how hard it is to be good sometimes."\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Bay Colt was in the pasture again. The farmer and\r\nhis man had found him far away and led him back. "I had a fine time," he\r\nsaid to his cousin, "and I don\'t feel a bit mean. I\'m going again\r\nto-day, but don\'t you tell." When his mother scolded him as he\r\ndeserved, he just switched his tail and thought about something else\r\nuntil she stopped talking. Then he ran away again.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when the Gray Colt saw him, he had a queer wooden thing\r\naround his neck, and fastened to this was a pole that stuck out ahead of\r\nhim. It tired his neck and bothered him when he wanted to run. If he had\r\ntried to jump the fence, it would have thrown him down. When the Gray\r\nColt came toward him, he pretended not to see her. He might just as well\r\nhave looked squarely at her as soon as she came, because, you know, he\r\nhad to look at her sometime, but he had a mean, slinking, afraid\r\nfeeling, such as people always have when they have done something wrong\r\nand have had time to think about it. Besides, he had changed his mind\r\nsince the wooden poke had been put on him, and somehow his running away\r\nseemed very foolish now. He wondered how he could ever have thought it\r\nany fun, and he was so disgusted that he couldn\'t keep his ears still,\r\nbut moved them restlessly when he remembered his own silliness.\r\n\r\nThe Gray Colt was too polite to say anything about his wearing the poke,\r\nand she talked about the grass, the sky, the trees, and everything else\r\nshe could think of. Once she was about to speak of the fence, and then\r\nshe remembered and stopped short. The Bay Colt noticed this. "You might\r\njust as well go on," said he. "You are very kind, but I know how foolish\r\nI have been, and there\'s no use in keeping still. You were right, and it\r\ndoesn\'t pay to jump fences for a few minutes of what you think will be\r\nfun. I feel sick all over when I think about it."\r\n\r\n"It\'s too bad," whinnied the Gray Colt. "I\'m very sorry for you."\r\n\r\n"And what do you think?" said the Bay Colt. "I heard the Dappled Gray\r\nsay this morning that I was like a Pig! Imagine a Colt being like a Pig!\r\nHe said that it didn\'t make any difference on which side of a fence Pigs\r\nwere, they always wanted to be on the other side, and that I was just as\r\nstupid."\r\n\r\nThis was all in the fall, before the cold weather had sent them to live\r\nin the barn, and while the Bay Colt was wearing the poke he could not\r\nwell forget the lesson he had learned about jumping and running away.\r\nHis mother grew quite proud of him, and the Dappled Gray had been heard\r\nto say that he might amount to something yet. That was a great deal for\r\nthe Dappled Gray to say, for although he had a very kind heart, he did\r\nnot often praise people, and hardly ever said such things about\r\ntwo-year-olds. That made it all the harder for him when the Bay Colt\r\nbecame cross over being told to stop cribbing.\r\n\r\nYou know there are some Colts who learn obedience easily, and there are\r\nothers who have one hard struggle to stop jumping, and another to stop\r\ncribbing, and another to stop kicking, and so on, all through their\r\nColthood. The older Horses are sorry for them and try to help them, for\r\nthey know that neither Colt nor Horse can really enjoy life until he is\r\ntrying to do right. To be sure, people sometimes do wrong even then, but\r\nif they will take advice and keep on trying they are certain to turn out\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when the Bay Colt seemed to have forgotten the lesson he had in\r\nthe fall, and after he had told the other Horses to let him alone, very\r\nstrange things began to happen. The farmer took him from his stall and\r\nmade him open his mouth. Then a piece of iron was slipped into it, which\r\nlay on top of his tongue and fitted into the place on each side of his\r\njaw where there were no teeth. Long lines were fastened to this iron on\r\neither side, and when he tossed his head and sidled around, these lines\r\nwere gently pulled by the farmer and the iron bit pressed down his\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nThe farmer was very kind, but the Bay Colt did not want the bit in his\r\nmouth, so he acted as ugly as he knew how, and kicked, and snapped with\r\nhis jaws open, and tried to run. The farmer did not grow angry or cross,\r\nyet whenever the Bay Colt showed his temper, the bit would press down\r\nhis tongue and stretch the corners of his mouth until he had to stop.\r\nOnce in a while the farmer would try to pat him and show him that it was\r\nall right, but the Bay Colt would not have this, and he was a very cross\r\nand sweaty two-year-old when he was taken back to his stall.\r\n\r\nHe missed the Gray Colt from her usual place, but soon she came in with\r\none of the farmer\'s men. She had been driven for the first time also.\r\n\r\n"Hallo!" said he. "Have you had a bit in your mouth too? Wasn\'t it\r\ndreadful? I am so angry that my hoofs fairly tingle to hit that farmer."\r\n\r\n"It was hard," said the Gray Colt, "but the man who drove me was very\r\nkind and let me rest often. He patted me, too, and that helped me to be\r\nbrave. My mother says we won\'t mind the bit at all after we are used to\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Bay Colt, "I\'m never going to be used to it. I won\'t\r\nstand it, and that\'s all there is about it." He stamped his hoofs and\r\nlooked very important. Two-year-olds often look quite as important as\r\nten-year-olds, and they feel much more so. The Bay Colt was rather proud\r\nof his feet, and thought it much nicer to have solid hoofs than to have\r\nthem split, like those of the Cows, the Hogs, and the Sheep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAD A SORE MOUTH FROM JERKING ON THE LINES.]\r\n\r\nWhen he said that he would not stand it to be driven, a queer little\r\nsound ran through the stalls. It was like the wind passing over a\r\nwheatfield, and was caused by the older Horses taking a long breath and\r\nwhispering to themselves. The Bay Colt\'s mother was saying, "Poor child!\r\nWhat hard work he does make of life!"\r\n\r\nThe next day both Colts were driven again, and the next day, and the\r\nnext, and the next. By this time the Gray Colt was quite used to it. She\r\nsaid she rather enjoyed knowing what the man was thinking, and that she\r\ncould tell his thoughts by the feeling of the lines, much as she used to\r\nunderstand her mother by rubbing noses when she was a tiny Colt. Her\r\ncousin had a sore mouth from jerking on the lines, and he could not\r\nenjoy eating at all. That made it even harder for him, because he got\r\nvery hungry, and it is not so easy to be sensible when one is hungry.\r\n\r\nWhen the Gray Colt learned to walk steadily and turn as her driver\r\nwished, she was allowed to draw a light log through the furrows of a\r\nfield. This tired her, but it made her very proud, and she arched her\r\nneck and took the daintiest of steps. It was not necessary that the log\r\nshould be drawn over the field; still, she did not know this, and\r\nthought it was real work, when it was done only to teach her to pull.\r\nThe man who was driving her patted her neck and held her nose in his\r\nhand. When he stopped to eat an apple, he gave her the core, and she\r\nthought she had never tasted anything so good. As she went back to her\r\nstall, she called to the Horses near, "I have been working. I have drawn\r\na log all around a field."\r\n\r\nThe Blind Horse spoke softly to her. "You will have a happy life, my\r\ndear, because you are a willing worker."\r\n\r\nAlthough the Bay Colt didn\'t say anything, he thought a great deal, and\r\nabout many things. While he was thinking he began to crib, but the\r\nnoise of his biting teeth on the wood startled him, and he shook his\r\nhead and whispered to himself, "I will never crib again." When he ate\r\nhis supper, his sore mouth hurt him, but he didn\'t whimper. "You deserve\r\nit," he said to himself. "It wouldn\'t have been sore if you had been\r\nsteady like your cousin." The Bay Colt was growing sensible very fast.\r\n\r\nThe Dappled Gray had noticed how suddenly he stopped cribbing, and so\r\nwatched him for a few days. He saw that the Bay Colt was in earnest,\r\nthat he drew the log up and down without making any fuss, and was soon\r\nhitched with his mother to a plow. The Dappled Gray and the Blind Horse\r\nwere also plowing that day, and they called across from their field.\r\n"Fine day for plowing," they said.\r\n\r\n"Perfect," answered the Bay Colt. "Did you notice the last furrow we\r\nturned? Can you do any better than that? If I had jumped, it would have\r\nbeen crooked instead of straight; and if I had stopped, it would not be\r\ndone yet."\r\n\r\n"Good furrow! Wonderful furrow!" answered the Dappled Gray. "Always knew\r\nyou\'d be a good worker when you got down to it. You are one of us now,\r\none of the working Horses. Glad of it. Good-bye!" And he turned away to\r\nstart his plow across the field again.\r\n\r\n"Do you like being grown up?" said the Bay Colt\'s mother to him.\r\n\r\n"Like it?" he answered with a laugh. "I\'m so proud that I don\'t know\r\nwhat to do. I wouldn\'t go back to the old life of all play for anything\r\nin the world. And my little cousin made me see my mistakes. Was there\r\never another Colt as foolish as I?"\r\n\r\n"A great many of them," said his mother. "More than you would guess.\r\nThey kick and bite and try to run because they cannot always have their\r\nown way; and then, when they have tried the farmer\'s way, and begin to\r\npay for his care of them, they find it very much better than the life of\r\nall play. Colts will be Colts."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWIN LAMBS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a Lamb, a bright, frisky young fellow, who had a twin sister.\r\nTheir mother loved them both and was as kind to one as to the other, but\r\nthe brother wanted to have the best of everything, and sometimes he even\r\nbunted his sister with his hard little forehead. His mother had to speak\r\nto him many times about this, for he was one of those trying children\r\nwho will not mind when first spoken to.\r\n\r\nHe did not really mean to be naughty--he was only strong and frisky and\r\nthoughtless. Sometimes he was even rude to his mother. She felt very sad\r\nwhen this was so, yet she loved him dearly and found many excuses for\r\nhim in her own heart.\r\n\r\nThere were three other pairs of twins in the flock that year, and as\r\ntheir mothers were not strong enough to care for two Lambs apiece, the\r\nfarmer had taken one twin from each pair to a little pen near the house.\r\nHere they stayed, playing happily together, and drinking milk from a\r\nbottle which the farmer\'s wife brought to them. They were hungry very\r\noften, like all young children, and when their stomachs began to feel\r\nempty, or even to feel as if they might feel empty, they crowded against\r\nthe side of the pen, pushed their pinkish-white noses through the\r\nopenings between the boards, and bleated and bleated and bleated to the\r\nfarmer\'s wife.\r\n\r\nSoon she would come from the kitchen door and in her hand would bring\r\nthe big bottle full of milk for them. There was a soft rubber top to\r\nthis bottle, through which the Lambs could draw the milk into their\r\nmouths. Of course they all wanted to drink at once, though there was\r\nonly a chance for one, and the others always became impatient while they\r\nwere waiting. The farmer\'s wife was patient, even when the Lambs, in\r\ntheir hurry to get the milk, took her fingers into their mouths and bit\r\nthem instead of the top of the bottle.\r\n\r\nOur twin Lamb wanted to have his sister taken into the pen with the\r\nother three, and he spoke about it to his mother. "I know how you can\r\nmanage," said he. "Whenever she comes near you, just walk away from her,\r\nand then the farmer will take her up to the pen."\r\n\r\n"You selfish fellow!" answered his mother. "Do you want your dear little\r\ntwin sister to leave us?"\r\n\r\nHe hung his head for a minute, but replied, "She\'d have just as good a\r\ntime. They have all they can eat up there, and they have lots of fun."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEEDING THE LAMBS.]\r\n\r\n"If you think it is so pleasant in the pen," said his mother, "suppose I\r\nbegin to walk away from you, and let the farmer take you away. I think\r\nyour sister would rather stay with me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" cried her son. "I don\'t want to leave my own dear woolly\r\nmother! I want to cuddle up to you every night and have you tell me\r\nstories about the stars."\r\n\r\n"Do you think you love me very much?" said she. "You don\'t know how to\r\nreally love yet, for you are selfish, and there is not room in a selfish\r\nheart for the best kind of love."\r\n\r\nThat made the Lamb feel very badly. "I do love her dearly," he cried, as\r\nhe stood alone. "I believe I love her ever so much more than my sister\r\ndoes."\r\n\r\nThat was where the little fellow was mistaken, for although his sister\r\ndid not talk so much about it, she showed her love in many other ways.\r\nIf she had been taken from her mother for even a few days, they could\r\nnever again have had such sweet and happy days together. Sheep look\r\nmuch alike, and they cannot remember each other\'s faces very long. If a\r\nLamb is taken away from his mother for even a short time, they do not\r\nknow each other when they meet afterward. Perhaps this is one reason why\r\nthey keep together so much, for it would be sad indeed not to know one\'s\r\nmother or one\'s child.\r\n\r\nHis sister never knew that he had wanted her taken away. She thought he\r\nacted queerly sometimes, but she was so loving and unselfish herself\r\nthat she did not dream of his selfishness. Instead of putting the idea\r\nout of his woolly little head, as he could have done by thinking more of\r\nother things, the brother let himself think of it more and more. That\r\nmade him impatient with even his mother, and he often answered her quite\r\ncrossly. Sometimes, when she spoke to him, he did not answer at all, and\r\nthat was just as bad.\r\n\r\nHis mother would sigh and say to herself, "My child is not a comfort to\r\nme after all, yet when I looked for the first time into his dear little\r\nface, I thought that as long as I had him beside me I should always be\r\nhappy."\r\n\r\nOne night, when the weather was fair and warm, the farmer drove all the\r\nSheep and Lambs into the Sheep-shed. They had been lying out under the\r\nbeautiful blue sky at night, and they did not like this nearly so well.\r\nThey did not understand it either, so they were frightened and\r\nbewildered, and bleated often to each other, "What is this for? What is\r\nthis for?"\r\n\r\nThe Lambs did not mind it so much, for they were not warmly dressed, but\r\nthe Sheep, whose wool had been growing for a year and was long and\r\nheavy, found it very close and uncomfortable. They did not know that the\r\nfarmer had a reason for keeping them dry that night while the heavy dew\r\nwas falling outside. The same thing was done every year, but they could\r\nnot remember so long as that, and having a poor memory is always hard.\r\n\r\n"Stay close to me, children," said the mother of the twins. "I may\r\nforget how you look if you are away long."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," said the brother, "that we always have to stay close\r\nto you. I never have a bit of fun!"\r\n\r\nWhen they had cuddled down for the night, the twin Lambs slept soundly.\r\nTheir mother lay awake for a long, long time in the dark, and she was\r\nnot happy. A few careless words from a selfish little Lamb had made her\r\nheart ache. They were not true words either, for during the daytime her\r\nchildren ran with their playmates and had fine frolics. Still, we know\r\nthat when people are out of patience they often say things that are not\r\nreally so.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, men came into the barn, which opened off the\r\nSheep-shed. They had on coarse, old clothing, and carried queer-looking\r\nshears in their hands. The Sheep could see them now and then when the\r\ndoor was open. Once the farmer stood in the doorway and seemed to be\r\ncounting them. This made them huddle together more closely than ever.\r\nThey could see the men carrying clean yellow straw into the barn and\r\nspreading it on the floor. On top of this was stretched a great sheet of\r\nclean cloth.\r\n\r\nThen the men began to come into the shed and catch the Sheep and carry\r\nthem into the barn. They were frightened and bleated a good deal, but\r\nwhen one was caught and carried away, although he might struggle hard to\r\nfree himself, he did not open his mouth. The old Wether Sheep was the\r\nfirst to be taken, and then the young ones who had been Lambs the year\r\nbefore. For a long time not one of the mothers was chosen. Still, nobody\r\nknew what would happen next, and so, the fewer Sheep there were left,\r\nthe more closely they huddled together.\r\n\r\nAt last, when the young Sheep had all been taken, one of the men caught\r\nthe mother of the twins and carried her away. She turned her face toward\r\nher children, but the door swung shut after her, and they were left with\r\nthe other Lambs and their mothers. From the barn came the sound of\r\nsnip-snip-snipping and the murmur of men\'s voices. Once the twins\r\nthought they saw their mother lying on the floor and a man kneeling\r\nbeside her, holding her head and forelegs under his arm, yet they were\r\nnot sure of this.\r\n\r\nThe brother ran to the corner of the shed and put his head against the\r\nboards. He suddenly felt very young and helpless. "My dear woolly\r\nmother!" he said to himself, over and over, and he wondered if he would\r\never see her again. He remembered what he had said to her the night\r\nbefore. It seemed to him that he could even now hear his own voice\r\nsaying crossly, "Seems to me we always have to stay close to you. I\r\nnever have a bit of fun!" He wished he had not said it. He knew she was\r\na dear mother, and he would have given anything in the world for a\r\nchance to stay close to her again.\r\n\r\nHis sister felt as lonely and frightened as he, but she did not act in\r\nthe same way. She stood close to a younger Lamb whose mother had just\r\nbeen taken away, and tried to comfort her. One by one the mothers were\r\ntaken until only the Lambs remained. They were very hungry now, and\r\nbleated pitifully. Still the twin brother stood with his head in the\r\ncorner. He had closed his eyes, but now he opened them, and through a\r\ncrack in the wall of the shed, he saw some very slender and\r\nwhite-looking Sheep turned into the meadow. At first they acted dizzy,\r\nand staggered instead of walking straight; then they stopped staggering\r\nand began to frisk. "Can it be?" said he. "It surely is!" For, although\r\nhe had never in his short life seen a newly shorn Sheep, he began to\r\nunderstand what had happened.\r\n\r\nHe knew that the men had only been clipping the long wool from the\r\nSheep, and that they were now ready for warm weather. No wonder they\r\nfrisked when their heavy burdens of wool were carefully taken off.\r\n\r\nNow the farmer opened the door into the barn again, and let the Lambs\r\nwalk through it to the gate of the meadow. They had never before been\r\ninside this barn, and the twin brother looked quickly around as he\r\nscampered across the floor. He saw some great ragged bundles of wool,\r\nand a man was just rolling up the last fleece. He wondered if that had\r\nbeen taken from his mother and was the very one against which he had\r\ncuddled when he was cold or frightened.\r\n\r\nWhen they first reached the pasture, the Lambs could not tell which\r\nwere their mothers. Shearing off their long and dingy fleeces had made\r\nsuch a difference in their looks! The twin brother knew his mother by\r\nher way of walking and by her voice, but he could see that his sister\r\ndid not know her at all. He saw his mother wandering around as though\r\nshe did not know where to find her children, and a naughty plan came\r\ninto his head. If he could keep his sister from finding their mother for\r\neven a short time, he knew that the farmer would take her up to the pen.\r\nHe thought he knew just how to do it, and he started to run to her. Then\r\nhe stopped and remembered how sad and lonely he had been without his\r\nmother only a little while before, and he began to pity the Lambs in the\r\npen.\r\n\r\nNow his selfishness and his goodness were fighting hard in him. One\r\nsaid, "Send your sister away," and the other, "Take her to your mother."\r\nAt last he ran as fast as he could toward his sister. "I am good now,"\r\nhe said to himself, "but it may not last long. I will tell her before I\r\nam naughty again."\r\n\r\n"Oh sister!" cried he. "Come with me to our mother. She doesn\'t know\r\nwhere to find us."\r\n\r\nHe saw a happy look on his sister\'s sad little face, and he was glad\r\nthat he had done the right thing. They skipped away together, kicking up\r\ntheir heels as they went, and it seemed to the brother that he had never\r\nbeen so happy in his life. He was soon to be happier, though, for when\r\nthey reached his "new, white mother," as he called her, and his sister\r\ntold her how he had shown her the way, his mother said, "Now you are a\r\ncomfort to me. You will be a happier Lamb, too, for you know that a\r\nmother\'s heart is large enough for all her children, and that the more\r\none loves, the better he loves."\r\n\r\n"Why, of course," said the twin sister. "What do you mean?"\r\n\r\nBut the mother never told her, and the brother never told her, and it is\r\nhoped that you will keep the secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VERY SHORT STORY OF THE FOOLISH LITTLE MOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mice who lived in the barn and around the granaries had many cousins\r\nliving on the farm who were pleasant people to know. Any one could tell\r\nby looking at them that they were related, yet there were differences in\r\nsize, in the coloring of their fur, in their voices, and most of all in\r\ntheir ways of living. Some of these cousins would come to visit at the\r\nbarn in winter, when there was little to eat in the fields. The Meadow\r\nMice never did this. They were friendly with the people who came from\r\nthe farmyard to graze in the meadow, yet when they were asked to return\r\nthe call, they said, "No, thank you. We are an out-of-door family, and\r\nwe never enter houses. We do not often go to the farmyard, but we are\r\nalways glad to see you here. Come again."\r\n\r\nWhen the Cows are in the meadow, they watch for these tiny people, and\r\nstop short if they hear their voices from the grass near by. Of course\r\nthe Horses are careful, for Horses will never step on any person, large\r\nor small, if they can help it. They are very particular about this.\r\n\r\nAll through the meadow you can see, if you look sharply, shallow winding\r\npaths among the grasses, and these paths are worn by the running to and\r\nfro of the Meadow Mice. Their homes are in stumps of trees or in the\r\nhigher ground near the ditches. In these homes the baby Meadow Mice stay\r\nuntil they are large enough to go out into the great world and eat\r\nroots, grasses, and seeds with their fathers and mothers. Sometimes they\r\ndo go out a little way with their mother before this, and they go in a\r\nvery funny fashion. Of course, when they are babies, they drink warm\r\nmilk from her body as the children of most four-legged people do.\r\nSometimes a young Meadow Mouse does not want to stop drinking his milk\r\nwhen it is time for his mother to leave the nest, so he just hangs on to\r\nher with his tiny, toothless mouth, and when she goes she drags him\r\nalong on the ground beside her. The ground is rather rough for such soft\r\nlittle babies, and they do not go far in this way, but are glad enough\r\nto snuggle down again with their brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\nThere is no danger of their being lonely, even when their mother is\r\naway, for the Meadow Mice have large families, and where there are ten\r\nbabies of the same age, or even only six, which is thought a small\r\nfamily among their people, it is not possible for one to feel alone.\r\n\r\nThere were two fine Meadow Mice who built their nest in the bank of a\r\nditch and were much liked by all their relatives. They had raised many\r\nchildren to full-grown Mousehood, and were kind and wise parents. When\r\ntheir children were married and had homes of their own, they still liked\r\nto come back to visit. The father and mother were gentle and kindly, as\r\nall Mice are, and were almost as handsome as when they first began to\r\ngnaw. Nobody could say that he ever saw a bit of dust on either of them.\r\n\r\nThe brown fur of the upper part of their bodies and the grayish-white\r\nfur underneath always lay sleek and tidy, and from their long whiskers\r\nto the tips of their hairless tails, they were as dainty as possible.\r\nThat was one reason why they were so fine-looking, for you know it makes\r\nno difference how beautiful one may be in the first place, if he does\r\nnot try to keep clean he is not pleasant to look at, while many quite\r\nplain people are charming because they look well and happy and clean.\r\n\r\nNow this pair of Mice had eight Mouse babies in their nest. The babies\r\nwere no larger than Bumble Bees at first and very pink. This was not\r\nbecause their fur was pink, but only because it was so very short that\r\nthrough it and their thin skin one saw the glow of the red blood in\r\ntheir veins.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see such beautiful babies?" said their mother proudly to\r\nher neighbors. "They are certainly the finest I ever had." Her friends\r\nsmiled, for she always said the same thing whenever she had little ones.\r\nYet they understood, for they had children of their own, and knew that\r\nalthough mothers love all alike, there is always a time when the\r\nyoungest seems the most promising. That is before they are old enough to\r\nbe naughty.\r\n\r\nThe days passed, and the eight baby Meadow Mice ate and slept and pushed\r\neach other around, and talked in their sweet, squeaky little voices.\r\nThey were less pink every day and more the color of their father and\r\nmother. They grew, too, so fast that the nest was hardly large enough\r\nfor them, and the teeth were showing in their tiny pink mouths. Their\r\nmother saw that they would soon be ready to go out into the world, and\r\nshe began to teach them the things they needed to know. She took them\r\noutside the nest each pleasant day and gave them lessons in running and\r\ngnawing, and showed them how to crouch down on the brown earth and lie\r\nstill until danger was past. After she had told them many things, she\r\nwould ask them short questions to make sure that they remembered.\r\n\r\n"How many great dangers are there?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Five," answered the little Mice.\r\n\r\n"What are they?"\r\n\r\n"Hawks, Owls, Weasels, Cats, and men."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about Hawks."\r\n\r\n"Hawks are big birds who seem to float in the air. They have very sharp\r\neyes, and when they see a Mouse they drop suddenly down and catch him.\r\nThey fly in the daytime."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about Owls."\r\n\r\n"They are big birds who fly by night without making any noise. They can\r\nsee from far away, and they catch Mice."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about Weasels."\r\n\r\n"They are slender little animals, nearly twice as long as a Mouse. They\r\nhave small heads, four short legs, and sharp claws; have brown fur on\r\ntheir backs and white underneath, and sometimes, when the weather is\r\nvery cold, they turn white all over."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about Cats."\r\n\r\n"Cats are very much bigger than Weasels, and are of many colors. They\r\nhave long tails and whiskers, and dreadful great eyes. They walk on four\r\nlegs, but make no noise because they have cushions on their feet."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about men."\r\n\r\n"Men are very big, two-legged people, and when they are fully grown are\r\ntaller than Cows. They make noise in walking, and they can neither smell\r\nnor see us from afar."\r\n\r\n"And what are you to do when you see these dangers coming?"\r\n\r\n"We are to run away as fast as we can from Hawks, Weasels, Owls, and\r\nCats. If a man comes near us, we are to lie perfectly still and watch\r\nhim, and are not to move unless we are sure that he sees us or is likely\r\nto step on us. Men do not know so much about Mice as the other dangers\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"And what if you are not sure that some creature is a Hawk, an Owl, a\r\nWeasel, or a Cat?"\r\n\r\n"If we even think it may be, we are to run."\r\n\r\n"When are you to run?"\r\n\r\n"At once."\r\n\r\n"Say that again."\r\n\r\n"We are to run at once."\r\n\r\n"Very good. That is all for to-day."\r\n\r\nYou can see how well the Meadow Mouse mother brought up her children,\r\nand how carefully she taught them about life. If they had been wise and\r\nalways minded her, they would have saved themselves much trouble.\r\n\r\nSeven of them were dutiful and obedient, but the largest of the eight,\r\nand the finest-looking, liked to decide things for himself, and often\r\nlaughed at his brothers and sisters for being afraid. Because he was so\r\nbig and handsome, and spoke in such a dashing way, they sometimes\r\nwondered if he didn\'t know as much as their mother.\r\n\r\nOne sunshiny day, when all the eight children were playing and feeding\r\ntogether in the short grass, one of them saw a great black bird in the\r\nair. "Oh, look!" she cried. "That may be a Hawk. We\'d better run."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said the biggest little Meadow Mouse. "Who\'s afraid?"\r\n\r\n"Mother said to run," they squeaked, and seven long bare tails whisked\r\nout of sight under a stump.\r\n\r\n"Ho-ho!" said the biggest little Meadow Mouse. "Before I\'d be so scared!\r\nI dare you to come back! I dare you to----"\r\n\r\nJust then the Hawk swooped down. And that is the end of the story, for\r\nafter that, there was no foolish little Meadow Mouse to tell about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONELY LITTLE PIG\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day the Brown Hog called to her twelve young Pigs and their ten\r\nolder brothers and sisters, "Look! look! What is in that cage?"\r\n\r\nThe twenty-two stubby snouts that were thrust through the opening of the\r\nrail-fence were quivering with eagerness and impatience. Their owners\r\nwished to know all that was happening, and the old mother\'s eyes were\r\nnot so sharp as they had once been, so if the Pigs wanted to know the\r\nnews, they must stop their rooting to find it out. Bits of the soft\r\nbrown earth clung to their snouts and trembled as they breathed.\r\n\r\n"It looks like a Pig," they said, "only it is white."\r\n\r\n"It is a Pig then," grunted their mother, as she lay in the shade of an\r\noak tree. "There are white Pigs, although I never fancied the color. It\r\nlooks too cold and clean. Brown is more to my taste, brown or black.\r\nYour poor father was brown and black, and a finer looking Hog I never\r\nsaw. Ugh! Ugh!" And she buried her eyes in the loose earth. The Pigs\r\nlooked at her and then at each other. They did not often speak of their\r\nfather. Indeed the younger ones did not remember him at all. One of the\r\nCows said he had such a bad temper that the farmer sent him away, and it\r\nis certain that none of them had seen him since the day he was driven\r\ndown the lane.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thinking of this and feeling rather sad, the wagon\r\nturned into their lane and they could plainly see the Pig inside. She\r\nwas white and quite beautiful in her piggish way. Her ears stood up\r\nstiffly, her snout was as stubby as though it had been broken off, her\r\neyes were very small, and her tail had the right curl. When she squealed\r\nthey could see her sharp teeth, and when she put her feet up on the\r\nwooden bars of her rough cage, they noticed the fine hoofs on the two\r\nbig toes of each foot and the two little toes high on the back of her\r\nlegs, each with its tiny hoof. She was riding in great style, and it is\r\nno wonder that the twenty-two Brown Pigs with black spots and black feet\r\nopened their eyes very wide. They did not know that the farmer brought\r\nher in this way because he was in a hurry, and Pigs will not make haste\r\nwhen farmers want them to. The Hogs are a queer family, and the Off Ox\r\nspoke truly when he said that the only way to make one hurry ahead is to\r\ntie a rope to his leg and pull back, they are so sure to be contrary.\r\n\r\n"She\'s coming here!" the Brown Pigs cried. "Oh, Mother, she\'s coming\r\nhere! We\'re going to see the men take her out of her cage."\r\n\r\nThe old Hog grunted and staggered to her feet to go with them, but she\r\nwas fat and slow of motion, so that by the time she was fairly standing,\r\nthey were far down the field and running helter-skelter by the side of\r\nthe fence. As she stared dully after them she could see the twenty-two\r\ncurly tails bobbing along, and she heard the soft patter of eighty-eight\r\nsharp little double hoofs on the earth.\r\n\r\n"Ugh!" she grunted. "Ugh! Ugh! I am too late to go. Never mind! They\r\nwill tell me all about it, and I can take a nap. I haven\'t slept half\r\nthe time to-day, and I need rest."\r\n\r\nJust as the Mother Hog lay down again, the men lifted the White Pig from\r\nthe wagon, cage and all, so she began to squeal, and she squealed and\r\nsquealed and squealed and squealed until she was set free in the field\r\nwith the Brown Pigs. Nobody had touched her and nobody had hurt her,\r\nbut it was all so strange and new that she thought it would make her\r\nfeel better to squeal. When she was out of her cage and in the field,\r\nshe planted her hoofs firmly in the ground, looked squarely at the Brown\r\nPigs, and grunted a pleasant, good-natured grunt. The Brown Pigs planted\r\ntheir hoofs in the ground and grunted and stared. They didn\'t ask her to\r\ngo rooting with them, and not one of the ten big Pigs or the twelve\r\nlittle Pigs said, "We are glad to see you."\r\n\r\nThere is no telling how long they would have stood there if the Horses\r\nhad not turned the wagon just then. The minute the wheels began to grate\r\non the side of the box, every Brown Pig whirled around and ran off.\r\n\r\nThe poor little White Pig did not know what to make of it. She knew that\r\nshe had not done anything wrong. She wondered if they didn\'t mean to\r\nspeak to her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EVERY BROWN PIG RAN OFF.]\r\n\r\nAt first she thought she would run after them and ask to root with them,\r\nbut then she remembered something her mother had told her when she was\r\nso young that she was pink. It was this: "When you don\'t know what to\r\ndo, go to sleep." So she lay down and took a nap.\r\n\r\nThe Brown Pigs did not awaken their mother, and when they stopped in the\r\nfence-corner one of them said to their big sister, "What made you run?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing," said she.\r\n\r\n"And why did you run?" the little Pigs asked their big brother.\r\n\r\n"Because," he answered.\r\n\r\nAfter a while somebody said, "Let\'s go back to where the White Pig is."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said somebody else, "don\'t let\'s! She can come over here if\r\nshe wants to, and it isn\'t nearly so nice there."\r\n\r\nYou see, they were very rude Pigs and not at all well brought up. Their\r\nmother should have taught them to think of others and be kind, which is\r\nreally all there is to politeness. But then, she had very little time\r\nleft from sleeping, and it took her all of that for eating, so her\r\nchildren had no manners at all.\r\n\r\nAt last the White Pig opened her round eyes and saw all the Brown Pigs\r\nat the farther end of the field. "Ugh!" said she to herself, "Ugh! I\r\nmust decide what to do before they see that I am awake." She lay there\r\nand tried to think what her mother, who came of a very fine family, had\r\ntold her before she left. "If you have nobody to play with," her mother\r\nhad said, "don\'t stop to think about it, and don\'t act as though you\r\ncared. Have a good time by yourself and you will soon have company. If\r\nyou cannot enjoy yourself, you must not expect others to enjoy you."\r\n\r\n"That is what I will do," exclaimed the White Pig. "My mother always\r\ngives her children good advice when they go out into the world, and she\r\nis right when she says that Pigs of fine family should have fine\r\nmanners. I will never forget that I am a Yorkshire. I\'m glad I didn\'t\r\nsay anything mean."\r\n\r\nSo the White Pig rooted in the sunshine and wallowed in the warm brown\r\nearth that she had stirred up with her pink snout. Once in a while she\r\nwould run to the fence to watch somebody in the lane, and before she\r\nknew it she was grunting contentedly to herself. "Really," she said, "I\r\nam almost having a good time. I will keep on making believe that I would\r\nrather do this than anything else."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe big sister of the Brown Pigs looked over to the White Pig and said,\r\n"She\'s having lots of fun all by herself, it seems to me."\r\n\r\nBig brother raised his head. "Let\'s call her over here," he answered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do!" cried the twelve little Pigs, wriggling their tails. "She\r\nlooks so full of fun."\r\n\r\n"Call her yourself," said the big sister to the big brother.\r\n\r\n"Ugh!" called he. "Ugh! Ugh! Don\'t you want to come over with us, White\r\nPig?"\r\n\r\nYou can imagine how the White Pig felt when she heard this; how her\r\nsmall eyes twinkled and the corners of her mouth turned up more than\r\never. She was just about to scamper over and root with them, when she\r\nremembered something else that her mother had told her: "Never run after\r\nother Pigs. Let them run after you. Then they will think more of you."\r\n\r\nShe called back, "I\'m having too good a time here to leave my\r\nrooting-ground. Won\'t you come over here?"\r\n\r\n"Come on," cried all the little Pigs to each other. "Beat you there!"\r\n\r\nThey ate and talked and slept together all afternoon, and when the Brown\r\nHog called her children home, they and the White Pig were the best of\r\nfriends. "Just think," they said to their mother, "the White Pig let us\r\nvisit her, and she is just as nice as she can be."\r\n\r\nThe White Pig in her corner of the pen heard this and smiled to herself.\r\n"My mother was right," she said; "\'Have a good time alone, and everybody\r\nwill want to come.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KITTEN WHO LOST HERSELF\r\n\r\n\r\n"I think," said the Blind Horse, "that something is the matter with my\r\nears." He and the Dappled Gray had been doing field-work all the\r\nmorning, and were now eating a hearty dinner in their stalls. They were\r\nthe only people on the first floor of the barn. Even the stray Doves who\r\nhad wandered in the open door were out in the sunshine once more. Once\r\nin a while the whirr of wings told that some Swallow darted through the\r\nwindow into the loft above and flew to her nest under the roof. There\r\nwas a deep and restful quiet in the sun-warmed air, and yet the Blind\r\nHorse had seemed to be listening to something which the other did not\r\nhear.\r\n\r\nThe Dappled Gray stopped eating at once. "Your ears?" said he. "What is\r\nwrong with them? I thought your hearing was very good."\r\n\r\n"It always has been," was the answer, "and finer than ever since I lost\r\nmy sight. You know it is always so with us blind people. We learn to\r\nhear better than we could before losing our sight. But ever since we\r\ncame in from the field I have had a queer sound in my ears, and I think\r\nthere is something the matter with them."\r\n\r\nThe Dappled Gray stopped eating and stood perfectly still to listen. He\r\ndid not even switch his tail, although at that minute there were three\r\nFlies on his left side and one on his neck. He was trying as hard as he\r\ncould to hear the queer sound also, for if he did, it would prove that\r\nthe noise was real and that the Blind Horse\'s hearing was all right.\r\n\r\nHe could not hear a thing. "What is it like?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Like the loud purring of a Cat," was the answer, "but everybody knows\r\nthat the Cat is not purring anywhere around here."\r\n\r\n"She might be," said the Dappled Gray. "Where does the sound seem to\r\nbe?"\r\n\r\n"Above my head," said the Blind Horse; "and she certainly would not be\r\npurring up there at this time. She would either be sound asleep, or off\r\nhunting, or else out in the sunshine, where she loves to sit."\r\n\r\nThe Dappled Gray felt that this was so, and he could not say a word. He\r\nwas very sorry for his friend. He thought how dreadful it would seem to\r\nbe both blind and deaf, and he choked on the oats he was swallowing.\r\n\r\n"Now don\'t worry," said the Blind Horse; "if I should be deaf, I could\r\nstill feel the soft touch of the breeze on my skin, and could taste my\r\ngood food, and rub noses with my friends. I wouldn\'t have spoken of it,\r\nonly I hoped that you could hear the noise also, and then I would know\r\nthat it was real." That was just like him. He was always patient and\r\nsweet-tempered. In all the years he had been blind, he had never once\r\ncomplained of it, and many times when the other Horses were about to say\r\nor do some ill-natured thing, they thought of him and stopped. They were\r\nashamed to be impatient when they were so much better off than he.\r\n\r\nThe Horses kept on eating their oats and resting from their hard work.\r\nIn the hay-loft above their heads, the Cat lay and purred and purred and\r\npurred, never dreaming that her doing so made trouble for her friends\r\ndownstairs.\r\n\r\nShe had been hunting all the night before, creeping softly through the\r\nbarn and hiding behind bags and boxes to watch for careless Mice and\r\nyoung Rats. They were night-runners as well as she, and many things\r\nhappened in the barn and farmyard while the larger four-legged people\r\nwere sound asleep and the fowls were dreaming with their heads tucked\r\nunder their wings. Sometimes there were not so many Mice in the morning\r\nas there had been the evening before, and when this was so, the Cat\r\nwould walk slowly through the barn and look for a comfortable\r\nresting-place. When she found it, she would turn around three times, as\r\nher great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother used to do to\r\ntrample a bed in the jungle, and then lie down for a long nap. She said\r\nshe always slept better when her stomach was full, and that was the\r\nhabit of all Cats.\r\n\r\nSometimes she hunted in the fields, and many a morning at sunrise the\r\nCows had seen her walking toward the barn on the top of the fences. She\r\ndid not like to wet her feet on the dewy grass when it could be helped;\r\nso, as soon as she was through hunting, she jumped on to the nearest\r\nfence and went home in that way.\r\n\r\nYes, last night she had been hunting, yet she was not thinking of it\r\nnow. Neither was she asleep. A Rat gnawed at the boards near her, and\r\nshe hardly turned her head. A Mouse ran across the floor in plain sight,\r\nand she watched him without moving. What did she care about them now?\r\nHer first Kittens lay on the hay beside her, and she would not leave\r\nthem on this first day of their lives unless she really had to.\r\n\r\nOf course she had seen little Kittens before--Kittens that belonged to\r\nother Cats--but she was certain that none of them had looked at all like\r\nher three charming babies. She could not decide which one of them was\r\nthe most beautiful. She was a Tortoise-shell Cat herself, and her fur\r\nwas spotted with white, black, and yellow. The babies had the same\r\ncolors on their soft coats, but not in just the same way as hers.\r\n\r\nAt first she thought her largest daughter was the beauty of the family;\r\nshe was such a clear yellow, with not a hair of any other color on her.\r\n"I always did like yellow Cats," said the young mother, "and they are\r\nsaid to be very strong."\r\n\r\nThen she looked at her smaller daughter, who was white with tiny yellow\r\nand black spots on neck and head. "Such a clean-looking baby," she\r\nexclaimed, "and I am sure that when her eyes are open I shall find them\r\nblue like my own."\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, the warm, dark little bunch of fur between her\r\nforepaws moved, and she looked lovingly down upon him, her only son. "He\r\nis certainly a very remarkable one," she said. "I never before saw such\r\na fine mixture of yellow and black, first a hair of one and then a hair\r\nof the other, so that, unless one is very close to him it looks like a\r\nrich brown. And then his feet!" She gave him a loving little poke with\r\none forefoot and turned him onto his back. This made him wave his tiny\r\npaws in the air. The thick cushions of skin on each were as black as\r\nblack could be, and that is very uncommon. They are usually pink, like\r\nthose of his sisters.\r\n\r\nThe little fellow lay there, wriggling very feebly, until his mother\r\ngave him another poke that turned him over. Then he stretched and\r\ncrawled toward her, reaching his head first one way and then another. He\r\nwas so weak that he could not raise his body from the hay, but dragged\r\nit along by taking short and uncertain steps with his four shaking legs.\r\nIt was only a short time since he found that he had legs, and he hadn\'t\r\nany idea how to use them. He just moved whichever one seemed most in his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t know where he was going, or what he was going for, but his\r\nlittle stomach was empty and he was cold. Something, he didn\'t know\r\nwhat, made him drag himself toward the big, warm creature near by. When\r\nhis black nose touched the fur of her body, he stopped pushing ahead and\r\nbegan to feel from side to side. He did not know now for what he was\r\nfeeling, yet when he found something his tiny mouth closed around it and\r\na stream of sweet warm milk began to flow down his throat and into his\r\nempty stomach. He did not know that it was milk. He did not know\r\nanything except that it was good, and then he fell asleep. His sisters\r\ndid in the same way, and soon the happy mother could look down and see\r\nher three babies in a row beside her, all sound asleep. Their pointed\r\nlittle tails lay straight out behind them, and their soft ears were bent\r\nforward close to their heads.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," said she, "if I was ever as small as they are, and if my\r\nmother loved me as I love them." She stretched out one of her forepaws\r\nand looked at it. It was so much larger, so very much larger, than the\r\npaws of the Kittens. Such a soft and dainty paw as it was, and so\r\nperfectly clean. She stretched it even more, and saw five long, curved,\r\nsharp claws slide out of their sheaths or cases. She quickly slid them\r\nback into their sheaths, for fear that in some way they might happen to\r\ntouch and hurt her babies.\r\n\r\nA Swallow flew down from his nest and passed over her head, then out of\r\nthe open window. "Kittens!" said he. "Kittens!" He flew over the fields\r\nand saw two Horses standing by the fence while the farmer was oiling his\r\nmachine. "We have new neighbors in the barn," said he, "and the Cat is\r\npurring louder than ever."\r\n\r\n"Who are the neighbors?" asked the Dappled Gray.\r\n\r\n"Kittens!" sang the Swallow. "Oh, tittle-ittle-ittle-ee."\r\n\r\nThe Blind Horse drew a long breath. "Then I did hear her purr," said he;\r\n"I am so glad." He never made a fuss about his troubles, for he was\r\nbrave and unselfish, yet the Dappled Gray knew without being told how\r\nmuch lighter his heart was since he heard that the Cat had really been\r\npurring above his head.\r\n\r\nThe days passed by, and the Kittens grew finely. They got their eyes\r\nopen, first in narrow cracks, and then wider and wider, until they were\r\nround and staring. The White Kitten had blue ones, the others brown. In\r\nthe daytime, they had long, narrow black spots in the middle of their\r\neyes, and as the bright light faded, these black spots spread out\r\nsideways until they were quite round. When it was very dark, these spots\r\nglowed like great Fireflies in the night. Then the Mice, who often\r\nscampered through the loft when the Cat was away, would see three pairs\r\nof eyes glowing in the hay, and they would squeak to each other: "See!\r\nThe Kittens are watching us."\r\n\r\nAnd the Kittens, who were not yet old enough to go hunting, and who were\r\nafraid of everything that stirred, would crowd up against each other,\r\narch their little backs, raise their pointed tails, stand their fur on\r\nend, and say, "Pst! Ha-a-ah!"\r\n\r\nSometimes they did this when there was not a person in sight and what\r\nfrightened them was nothing but a wisp of hay, blown down by the wind.\r\nAfterward, when anything moved, they sprang at it, held it down with\r\ntheir sharp little claws, and chewed on it with their pointed white\r\nteeth. When they were tired of this game, they played hide-and-seek, and\r\nwhen they were tired of that they chased their tails. It was so nice\r\nalways to have playthings with them. Sometimes, too, they chased each\r\nother\'s tails, and caught them and bit them hard, until the Kitten who\r\nowned the tail cried, "Mieow!" and tumbled the biter over.\r\n\r\nThey were allowed to play all through the loft except over the mangers.\r\nTheir mother was afraid that if they went there they would fall through\r\nthe holes which had been left in the floor. During the winter, the\r\nfarmer used to throw hay down through these to the hungry Horses. When\r\nthe Cat saw her children going toward these places, she called them back\r\nand scolded them. Sometimes she struck them lightly on the ears with her\r\nforepaw. "I don\'t like to," said she, "but they must learn to keep away.\r\nIt is not safe for them to go there."\r\n\r\nOne morning when she was away, they were playing hide-and-seek, and the\r\nWhite Kitten was hunting for a good hiding-place. "I\'ll hide near one of\r\nthese holes," she said, "and they won\'t dare come there to look. Then,\r\nafter they have hunted a long, long time, I\'ll get another place and\r\nlet them find me." She did hide there, and after a long, long time, when\r\nher brother and sister were in the farther end of the loft, she tried to\r\nrun over to another dark corner. Instead of that, the hay began to slip\r\nand slide under her and she went down, down, down, through a long dark\r\nbox, and hit with a hard thud at the bottom.\r\n\r\nShe was so scared that she couldn\'t have told how many toes she had on\r\nher forefeet. Of course, she had five on each, like all Kittens, and\r\nfour on each hind-foot, but if anybody had asked her then, she would\r\nhave been quite likely to say "three."\r\n\r\nShe was sore, too, and when she felt a warm breath on her and opened her\r\neyes, she saw that some great creature had thrust his nose through a\r\nhole in the side of the dark box. "It must be a Horse," she thought,\r\n"and my mother says that they are kind to Cats. I think I\'d better tell\r\nhim who I am. I don\'t want him to take me for a Pig, because he may not\r\nlike Pigs." You see, she forgot that Horses had been living in the great\r\nworld and could tell to what family a person belonged the very first\r\ntime they saw him. The only people she had ever seen were Swallows and\r\nMice.\r\n\r\n"If--if you please, sir," she said, "I am the White Kitten, and I just\r\ntumbled down from the hay-loft, but I didn\'t mean to."\r\n\r\n"I am the Blind Horse," answered a strong and gentle voice outside, "and\r\nI hope you are not hurt."\r\n\r\n"Not very much," answered the Kitten. "I just feel ache-y in my back and\r\nscared all over."\r\n\r\n"Come out into the manger, White Kitten," said the Blind Horse, "and\r\nperhaps you won\'t be so scared. I won\'t touch you, although I should\r\nlike to. You know I am blind, and so, unless I can touch people I\r\ndon\'t know how they look."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I AM THE WHITE KITTEN.]\r\n\r\nThe White Kitten crawled out and saw him, and then she wasn\'t afraid at\r\nall. She was so sorry for him that she couldn\'t be afraid. She\r\nremembered the time before her eyes opened when she had to feel for\r\neverything she wanted. It was not so hard then, because she did not know\r\nanything different, but now she could not bear to think of not being\r\nable to see all that was around her. "If you will put your nose down in\r\nthe other end of the manger," she said, "I will rub up against it, and\r\nyou will know more how I look."\r\n\r\nThe Blind Horse did this, and who can tell how happy it made him when\r\nher warm and furry back rubbed up against his nose? "Thank you," he\r\nwhinnied; "you are very good."\r\n\r\n"Would you know I was a Kitten if I hadn\'t told you?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I would," he answered.\r\n\r\n"And you wouldn\'t have thought me a Pig?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Never!" said he; "I wouldn\'t even have believed you if you had told me\r\nthat you were one."\r\n\r\nThe Blind Horse and the White Kitten became firm friends, and when she\r\ntried to wash off the dirt that got into her fur she sat in the very\r\nmiddle of the manger and told him all about it.\r\n\r\n"My mother always has washed me," she said, "but my tongue is getting\r\nbig enough to wash with now. It is getting rougher, too, and that is a\r\ngood thing. My mother says that the reason why all the prickles on Cats\'\r\ntongues point backward is because then we can lick all the meat off from\r\nbones with them. I\'m \'most old enough to eat meat now. I can\'t wash the\r\ntop of my head though. You have to wet your paw and scrub it with that.\r\nCan you wash the top of your head?"\r\n\r\nThen the Blind Horse told her how the men kept him clean; and while he\r\nwas telling this the Cat came into his stall, crying and looking for her\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother," cried the White Kitten, "I tumbled down, but I didn\'t mean\r\nto, and I\'m sorry I didn\'t mind you, and the Blind Horse can\'t wash the\r\ntop of his head, and he knew that I wasn\'t a Pig."\r\n\r\nThe Cat was so glad to find the White Kitten that she didn\'t scold at\r\nall, but jumped into the manger and washed her clean, and then caught\r\nthe loose skin of the Kitten\'s neck between her teeth and carried her\r\nthrough the stalls, across the barn-floor, and up the stairs to their\r\nhome. That made the Kitten much ashamed, for she thought that she was\r\nold enough to go alone.\r\n\r\nFor two whole days after this the White Kitten was so lame from her fall\r\nthat she could only lie still on the hay, and she could see that her\r\nmother did not treat her as before. "I won\'t ever go near those places\r\nagain," she said. "I never will."\r\n\r\n"You promised me before that you would stay away," said her mother, "and\r\nyou broke your promise." She did not punish the White Kitten, but she\r\nfelt very sad and she could not help showing it. There was a dreadful\r\nache in her child\'s little Kitten-heart that was a great deal worse than\r\nthe lameness in her back or in her neck or in her legs.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a day when the whole family walked downstairs, and\r\nthe Cat showed her three children to the farmyard people and spoke a few\r\nwords about each. "The yellow Kitten, my big daughter," said she,\r\n"promises to be the best hunter: she is a wonderful jumper, and her\r\nclaws are already nearly as long as mine. My son, the brown one, has a\r\nremarkable voice. And this White Kitten, my little daughter, is the most\r\nobedient of all. She has never disobeyed me since the day she fell into\r\nthe manger, and I can trust her perfectly."\r\n\r\nThen the White Kitten knew that she was quite forgiven, and she was the\r\nhappiest person on the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHICKEN WHO WOULDN\'T EAT GRAVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was some time after the Dorking Hen had come off the nest with her\r\nlittle brood, that the mother of the Shanghai Chickens began to have so\r\nmuch trouble.\r\n\r\nShe had twelve as fine Chickens as you could find anywhere: tall,\r\nwide-awake youngsters with long and shapely legs and thick down and\r\nfeathers. She was very proud of them, as any Hen mother might well be,\r\nand often said to the Shanghai Cock, "Did you ever see so fine a family?\r\nLook at those twenty-four legs, all so long and straight, and not a\r\nfeather on one of them." His eyes would shine and he would stretch his\r\nneck with pride, but all he ever said to her was, "They will do very\r\nwell if they only behave as well as they look." He did not believe in\r\npraising children to their faces, and he thought their mother spoiled\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was right, for the little Shanghais soon found out that they\r\nwere good-looking, and they wanted everybody in the poultry-yard to\r\nnotice their legs. It was very foolish, of course, to be proud of such\r\nthings, but when the other fowls said, "We should think you would be\r\ncold without feathers on your legs," they answered, "Oh, we are\r\nShanghais, and our family never wear feathers there!" And that was true,\r\njust as it is true that the Dorkings have extra toes, and that the Black\r\nSpanish fowls have white ears.\r\n\r\nThe Shanghai mother was now roaming the fields with her brood, and there\r\nwas rich picking in the wheat-stubble. All the fowls were out of the\r\nyard now, and would not be shut up until cold weather. Early in the\r\nmorning they would start out in parties of from six to a dozen, with a\r\nCock at the head of each. He chose the way in which they should go; he\r\nwatched the sky for Hawks, and if he saw one, gave a warning cry that\r\nmade the Hens hurry to him. The Cocks are the lords of the poultry-yard\r\nand say how things shall be there; but when you see them leading the way\r\nin the fields,--ah, then you know why all the fowls obey them.\r\n\r\nThe farmyard people still tell of the day when a Hawk swooped down on\r\none of the young Dorkings and would have carried him off if the Black\r\nSpanish Cock had not jumped out, and pecked him and struck at him with\r\nhis spurs, and fought, until the Hawk was glad to hurry away. The Cocks\r\nare not only brave--they are polite, too, and when they find food they\r\nwill not eat it until they have called the Hens to come and share with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine what good times the Chickens had in the stubble-fields.\r\nThey were so old now that their down was all covered with feathers, and\r\nsome of them wondered if they couldn\'t feel their spurs growing. Still,\r\nthat was all nonsense, as a Bantam told them, because spurs do not start\r\nuntil the fowl is a year old. They had long been too large to cuddle\r\nunder their mother\'s feathers at night, and had taken their first\r\nlessons in roosting before they went to the stubble-fields. They had\r\nlearned to break up their own food, too, and that was a great help to\r\ntheir mother. Fowls, you know, have no teeth, and no matter how big a\r\nmouthful one takes he has to swallow it whole. The only way they can\r\nhelp themselves is to break the pieces apart with their feet or peck\r\nthem apart with their bills before eating them.\r\n\r\nThe yellow grains of wheat that lay everywhere in the field were fine\r\nfood, and should have made the little Shanghais as fat as the Grouse who\r\nsometimes stole out from the edge of the forest. Eleven of the brood\r\nwere quite plump, but one Chicken was still thin and lank. His mother\r\nwas very much worried about him and could not think what was the matter.\r\nShe spoke of it to the Black Spanish Hen one day, but the Black Spanish\r\nHen had never raised a brood, and said she really didn\'t know any more\r\nabout the care of Chickens than if she were a Dove. Then the anxious\r\nmother went to the Shanghai Cock about it. He listened to all she said\r\nand looked very knowing.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there is anything the matter," said he. "The Chick is\r\ngrowing fast, that is all. I remember how it was with me before I got my\r\nlong tail-feathers. I was very thin, yet see what a fine-looking fellow\r\nI am now." He was really a sight worth seeing as he towered above the\r\nother fowls, flapping his strong wings in the sunshine and crowing. His\r\nfeathers were beautiful, and the bright red of his comb and wattles\r\nshowed that he was well. "Ah," thought the Shanghai Hen, "if my Chicken\r\ncould only become such a fine-looking Cock!" And she didn\'t worry any\r\nmore all day.\r\n\r\nThat night she and her brood roosted in the old apple-tree in the corner\r\nof the orchard nearest the poultry-yard. She flew up with the older\r\nfowls and fluttered and lurched and squawked and pushed on first one\r\nbranch and then another, while the Chickens were walking up a slanting\r\nboard that the farmer had placed against one of the lower branches. It\r\nalways takes fowls a long time to settle themselves for the night. They\r\nchange places and push each other, and sometimes one sleepy Hen leans\r\nover too far and falls to the ground, and then has to begin all over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAt first the Chickens had feared that they would tumble off as soon as\r\nthey were asleep, but they soon learned that their feet and the feet of\r\nall other birds are made in such a way that they hang on tightly even\r\nduring sleep. The weight of the bird\'s body above hooks the toes around\r\nthe branch, and there they stay until the bird wishes to unhook them.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time, all the fowls were asleep with their heads under\r\ntheir wings. The Sheep, Pigs, and Cows were dreaming, and even the\r\nHorses were quiet in their stalls. There was not a light to be seen in\r\nthe big white farmhouse, when the Dorking Cock crowed in his sleep. That\r\nawakened him and all the other fowls as well. Then the other Cocks\r\ncrowed because he did and he crowed again because they did, and they\r\ncrowed again because he had crowed again, and the Chickens asked if it\r\nwere not almost morning, and their mothers told them not to talk but to\r\ngo to sleep at once and make morning come more quickly.\r\n\r\nAll of this took quite a while, and the Shanghai mother could not sleep\r\nagain. She could see her brood quite plainly in the moonlight, and one\r\nof them was not plump like the rest. She roosted there and worried about\r\nhim until suddenly (she could never tell how it happened) she seemed to\r\nknow just what was the matter.\r\n\r\nShe flew down beside him and poked him under his wing. "Wake up," she\r\nsaid. "I want to ask you something. Do you eat gravel?"\r\n\r\n"No," he answered sleepily, "I don\'t like gravel."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I bring you up to eat it?" she asked sternly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I don\'t like it, and now that I am old enough to roost in a\r\ntree I don\'t mean to eat any more. So!"\r\n\r\nJust imagine a Chicken talking to his mother in that way! His mother,\r\nwho had laid the egg from which he was hatched; who had sat upon the\r\nnest through all the weary days and nights while he was growing inside\r\nhis shell; who had cuddled him under her soft feathers; who had taught\r\nhim all he knew, and would have fought any hawk to save him! She had\r\nbegun to love him before he even knew that he was, and had lived for him\r\nand his brother and sisters ever since.\r\n\r\nThe mother said nothing more to him then. She spent the rest of the\r\nnight watching the stars and the moon and the first rosy flush of the\r\neastern sky which told that morning was near. Then she said to her\r\nnaughty Chicken, as he began to stir and cheep, "I shall never try to\r\nmake you eat gravel if you think you are too big to mind your mother. I\r\nshall just tell you this, that you will never be strong unless you do. I\r\nhave not told you why, because you never asked, and I supposed you would\r\ndo as you ought without knowing the reason. You have no teeth, and you\r\ncannot chew the grain you eat before it is swallowed. You have a strong\r\nstomach, and if you eat gravel this stomach or gizzard will rub and\r\npress the tiny stones against the grain until it is well broken up and\r\nready to make into fat and strength for your body."\r\n\r\n"But it doesn\'t taste good," he replied, "and I\'d rather eat other\r\nthings. I don\'t believe it matters, and I won\'t eat it anyway."\r\n\r\nThe Shanghai Hen flew down from the tree and clucked to her Chickens.\r\nShe would not waste time talking to him. Whenever he came near her that\r\nday, he ate everything but gravel. He had his own way and yet he was not\r\nhappy. For some reason, nothing seemed to be any fun. Even lying under\r\nthe bushes on the sunshiny side was not comfortable, and when he\r\nwallowed in the dust with his brothers and sisters he didn\'t enjoy that.\r\n\r\nThings went on this way for a good many days, and at last he saw that\r\nhis shadow was only a small black spot on the ground, while his\r\nbrothers and sisters had big fat shadows. He heard the Black Spanish\r\nCock call him a Bantam, and the Shanghai Cock say that he wouldn\'t live\r\nuntil his spurs grew. One of the Dorking Chickens was talking to her\r\nsister, and he heard her say, "Imagine him at the head of a flock!" Then\r\nshe laughed, a mean, cackling little laugh.\r\n\r\nThat night, when the rest were asleep in the apple-tree, he walked\r\nsoftly down the slanting board and ate gravel. The next morning he felt\r\nbetter than he had in a long time, so when there was nobody around he\r\nate some more. He didn\'t want anyone else to know that he had found out\r\nhis mistake. Every morning he looked at his shadow, and it grew fatter\r\nand fatter. Still he was not happy, and he knew it was because he had\r\nnot told his patient old mother. He wanted to tell her, too. One day he\r\nheard her telling his brother to eat more gravel, and the brother said\r\nhe didn\'t like the taste of it. That made him speak at last.\r\n\r\n"Suppose you don\'t like it, you can eat it. Queer world it would be if\r\nwe didn\'t have to do unpleasant things. I\'ve just made up my mind that\r\nthe people who won\'t do hard things, when they ought to, have the\r\nhardest times in the end. Wish I\'d minded my mother and eaten gravel\r\nwhen she told me to, and I\'m not going to let you be as foolish as I\r\nwas."\r\n\r\nJust then he heard somebody say of him, "What a fine-looking fellow he\r\nis growing to be! I like him ever so much now."\r\n\r\nIt was the Dorking Chicken who had laughed at him. He ran after a\r\nGrasshopper, and she ran after the same Grasshopper, and they ran\r\nagainst each other and the Grasshopper got away, so of course they had\r\nto wander off together to find something to eat, and after that they\r\nbecame great friends.\r\n\r\nThe Shanghai Hen looked lovingly after him and raised one foot in the\r\nair. "Now," she said, "I am perfectly happy."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOOSE WHO WANTED HER OWN WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to tell which family is the most important among the\r\nfarmyard people. There is no one animal so wise as Collie, the farmer\'s\r\ndog, and all the rest love him and mind him when he is sent to bring\r\nthem up from the pasture or to drive them to the water. Still, he does\r\nnot spend his days in barn or field and only comes with his master or\r\nfor a visit now and then.\r\n\r\nYou may remember how the Garter Snake and the old Tree Frog were the\r\nleaders in the meadow, and how in the forest all looked up to the Ground\r\nHog. These people were patient and old, and partly because they were old\r\nand had had many years in which to think about life, they were very\r\nwise. In the farmyard the Oxen were the most patient and the oldest, and\r\nit was to them that all the animals went when they were in trouble.\r\n\r\nThere were also the Horses, fine strong creatures, always helping\r\nsomebody else and working all day during most of the year. They drew the\r\nreaper through the tall grain, and where in the morning had been a field\r\nof waving golden wheat, at sunset were bundles or sheaves of gathered\r\ngrain, and the stubble was ready for the fowls. They were busy people;\r\nand sometimes during the winter they liked to remind their neighbors how\r\nmuch they had done.\r\n\r\nThen again, there were the Cows, who are the sisters of the Oxen. They\r\nare large and there are many of them, yet they are not so wise, and that\r\nis easily understood. All that they have to do on the farm is to give\r\nmilk for the butter-and cheese-making, and for the farmer\'s children to\r\ndrink. No farmer could get along without his Cows, but they do not work\r\nlike their brothers. They have so easy a time that they do not learn\r\nmuch. You know, when people work, they have to think, and when people\r\nthink enough useful thoughts it makes them wise. That is one of the many\r\nreasons why it is so foolish to be lazy.\r\n\r\nTruly, it would be hard to say which farmyard family is the most\r\nimportant, but there is no trouble at all in telling which family think\r\nthemselves the most so. If you ask any Goose, she will tell you that one\r\nof their flock is worth five Horses or a dozen Cows. Nobody else would\r\ntell you this, and if you should speak of it to the span of Bays, or the\r\nDappled Gray, or even the youngest Colt in the stable, they would answer\r\nyou only with a hearty Horse laugh. The Cows would smile and reply,\r\n"What a Goose she was to say that!"\r\n\r\nThere has always been a flock of Geese on the farm, and their neighbors\r\nare so used to their queer ways that they only smile when the Geese put\r\non airs, and it is a good-natured smile, too. They even feel rather\r\nsorry for them when they lose their feathers, although the Nigh Ox once\r\nsaid that if it were not for being plucked once in a while, the Geese\r\nwould really be too airy to live with.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Nigh Ox was right in what he said, for certainly after they\r\nhave worn their feathers all winter, they hold their heads higher than\r\never, and tell what they think and what they would do, and it is well\r\nthey should be reminded that they work for a living like all their\r\nneighbors. The farmer\'s wife never plucks the Geese until warm weather\r\ncomes. Then she takes all the soft, short feathers that they have worn\r\nthrough the winter, and this leaves them looking very ragged indeed.\r\nThere was a time, years ago, when Geese had to give up their long\r\ntail-and wing-feathers to be whittled into pens, but these Geese didn\'t\r\nknow about that, and there was nobody in the farmyard old enough to\r\nremember it and tell them, so they thought they had a pretty hard time\r\nin even giving up their breast feathers.\r\n\r\n"Sssss!" the Gander used to say, "if the farmer\'s boys must have\r\nfeather pillows on which to lay their heads, why do they not grow their\r\nown feathers?"\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said the Nigh Ox once; "If you must have oats to eat, why don\'t\r\nyou grow the oats?" But the Gander was already waddling away and\r\npretended not to hear him.\r\n\r\nIt is in the winter that the Geese put on the most airs. Then, when the\r\nHorses are being harnessed, they say to each other, "Dear me! Wouldn\'t\r\nit be dreadful to work in that way for a living?" And sometimes, when\r\nthe team is hitched to a post by the farmhouse, they waddle past in a\r\nsingle line with the Gander at the head, and say to the Horses: "Hear\r\nyou have to take a load of wood to town. It\'s too bad. Hope you won\'t\r\nget very tired. We are going to the river for a nice cold swim.\r\nGood-bye." Then they march off with their heads held high, and as soon\r\nas their backs are turned, the Horses look at each other and laugh\r\nsoftly. They know that there is nothing in the world better than good,\r\nhonest, hard work, no matter of what kind it is.\r\n\r\nEvery winter the Geese forget about having to be plucked, and every\r\nspring they are surprised to lose their feathers. They are plucked four\r\ntimes before fall comes, and these four times come so near together that\r\neven they can remember from one to another. You would think that then\r\nthey would not be so airy, but instead of saying, "Of course we work for\r\nour living--why shouldn\'t we?" they say, "Why, yes, we do let the\r\nfarmer\'s wife have some of our feathers when she wants them. We suppose\r\nyou might call it work to grow feathers for her, still it does not take\r\nmuch of our time, and it is quite different from drawing loads and\r\ngetting tired as the Horses and Oxen do. Growing feathers is genteel."\r\n\r\nThey do not remember anything long, and so, when they have made a\r\nmistake once, they are likely to make the same mistake over and over\r\nagain. Then, too, they cannot tell big things from little things, and\r\nthey are not happy unless they can have their own way all the time. And\r\nyou know that nobody can be sure of that. It all comes of their not\r\nbeing willing to think hard, and sometimes it makes them a great deal of\r\ntrouble, as it did on the day when the Gray Goose would not go through\r\nthe farmyard gate.\r\n\r\nThis was soon after the Gander and his wife had hatched their brood of\r\nseven Goslings, and they were taking them at once to the brook. It was\r\na happy day for all the flock. The Gander and the Mother Goose were glad\r\nbecause their children were safely out of the shell, and because they\r\nwould no longer have to sit with cramped legs on the nest. Ganders are\r\ngood fathers, for they cover the eggs half of the time, while the Mother\r\nGoose is resting. The other Geese were not only proud of the Goslings,\r\nbut they were glad to have the Gander and the Mother Goose free to go\r\naround with them again. They had missed them very much.\r\n\r\nThe gate from the farmyard into the meadow stood wide open, and all the\r\nGeese except the Gray one followed the Gander through. The Gray Goose\r\ntried to go through a small hole in the fence very near the gate. She\r\nsqueezed her head into it and stretched her neck on the meadow side of\r\nthe fence, but she could not get any farther, although she pushed until\r\nshe was dizzy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAY GOOSE TRIED TO GO THROUGH.]\r\n\r\n"Wait for me," she cried. "Wait for me-ee!"\r\n\r\n"Hurry, then," said the Gander.\r\n\r\n"I am hurrying," she cried, and she pushed with all her strength, but\r\nsince the hole in the fence was so small, she did not get any farther\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\n"Go through the gateway," said the Nigh Ox, who was grazing near by.\r\n\r\n"Sssss!" said the Gray Goose stiffly. "I would rather go through here. I\r\nhave chosen to go this way."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said the Nigh Ox, "excuse me! Do go through there by all means!"\r\n\r\n"We are going on," called the Gander; "we would wait, but the Goslings\r\nare in a hurry to take their first bath. Come as soon as you can."\r\n\r\nThe Gray Goose tried harder than ever to go the way that she had chosen,\r\nbut it only made her so out of breath that she had to lie down and rest.\r\nOnce she thought she heard somebody laugh, yet when she looked at the\r\nNigh Ox, who was the only person around, he was lying with closed eyes\r\nand solemnly chewing his cud, so she decided that she must have been\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nDown by the brook the rest of the flock were cackling merrily, and she\r\ncould see the seven Goslings swimming with the Geese and the Gander.\r\n"Oh," she cried, "how I wish I were with them! I don\'t see what is the\r\nmatter with this hole in the fence. The farmer ought to make it bigger."\r\n\r\nShe pushed and scolded and fussed until her neck was sore and she was\r\ntoo tired to swim if she had a chance, so she sat down to rest. She did\r\nremember what the Nigh Ox had said; still, if she couldn\'t go as she had\r\nplanned, she wouldn\'t go at all. She walked into the barn to find a cool\r\nand shady place, lowering her head as she stepped over the threshold of\r\nthe high front door.\r\n\r\n"What did you do that for?" twittered a Swallow.\r\n\r\n"Because I don\'t want to hit my head on the top of the doorway;" she\r\nreplied. "I always do so. All of our flock do so."\r\n\r\n"Tittle-ittle-ittle-ee," laughed the Swallow, as she darted away and\r\nalighted on the fence by the Nigh Ox. "Why isn\'t the Gray Goose in\r\nswimming with the rest?" asked she.\r\n\r\n"Because she can\'t push her fat body through that hole in the fence,"\r\nsaid the Nigh Ox, switching his tail toward it as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Why doesn\'t she go through the gateway, then?" asked the Swallow.\r\n\r\n"Because she says she would rather go the other way, and that if she\r\ncan\'t go that way, she won\'t go at all."\r\n\r\n"And she is missing all that fun?" said the Swallow.\r\n\r\n"All of it," answered the Nigh Ox, "but then, you know, she is such a\r\nGoose!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY THE SHEEP RAN AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was during the hottest summer weather that the wind-storm came. The\r\nfarmyard people always spoke of it as "the" wind-storm, because not even\r\nthe Blind Horse, who had lived on the farm longer than any of his\r\nneighbors, could remember anything like it. "I recall one time," he\r\nsaid, "when a sweet-apple tree was blown down in the fall. The Hogs\r\nfound it and ate all the fruit before the farmer knew that it was down.\r\nYou should have heard them grunt over it. They were afraid the farmer\r\nwould drive them away before they had eaten it all. Eh, well! They ate\r\nall they wanted, but one of the Pigs told me afterward that it made them\r\nsick, and that he never wanted to see another sweet apple as long as he\r\nlived. That was a hard storm, but not like this, not like this."\r\n\r\nIt had come in the night when the farmyard people were asleep, and there\r\nwas much scampering to shelter. The fowls, who were roosting in the old\r\napple-tree, did not have time to oil their feathers and make them\r\nwater-proof. They just flew off their perches as fast as they could and\r\nran for the open door of the Hen-house. When they were once inside, they\r\nruffled up their feathers and shook themselves to get rid of the\r\nrain-drops. Fowls do not like wet weather, and it vexes them very much\r\nto be in the rain. Their neighbors know this so well that it has become\r\ntheir custom to say of an angry person that he is "as mad as a wet Hen."\r\n\r\nThe Cows were in their part of the barn with their necks between the\r\nstanchions, so there was nothing for them to do but to keep still and\r\nthink of those who were out of doors. The Horses were in their\r\ncomfortable stalls. They had been working hard all day and the farmer\r\nhad gotten a good supper of oats ready for them in their mangers, so\r\nthat they could eat quickly and go to sleep, instead of staying awake\r\nand walking around to get their own suppers in the pasture.\r\n\r\nOut in the meadow the Sheep huddled close together under a low-branching\r\ntree, and stood still until the storm passed. They had been so warm that\r\nthe cool rain made them comfortable, but the wind pushed them and swayed\r\nthe branches of the trees. The loud thunder made the Lambs jump. They\r\nliked the lightning and made a game out of it, each one telling what he\r\nhad seen by the last flash. The clouds, too, were beautiful, and flew\r\nacross the sky like great dark birds with downy breasts, dropping now\r\nand then shining worms from their beaks.\r\n\r\nAt last the air became cool and clear, and the clouds flew far away\r\ntoward the east. Next, the stars peeped out, first one, then two, then\r\nsix, then twenty, and then so many that you could not have counted\r\nthem,--more than the leaves on a maple-tree, more than the grass-blades\r\nof the meadow. The Sheep ran around a little to shake off the rain-drops\r\nand warm themselves, then they huddled down again to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun arose in the eastern sky, his warm beams fell upon the\r\nSheep and awakened them. "How cool and beautiful a day," they said.\r\n"What a morning for a run!"\r\n\r\n"I can beat you to the tall grass!" called one little Lamb to the rest,\r\nand they all scampered around the field, throwing up their heels for\r\njoy. They had been away from their mothers for awhile, and had learned\r\nto eat grass instead of milk. They were quite proud of the way in which\r\nthey broke it off, with quick upward jerks of their heads, and their\r\nteeth were growing finely. They did not expect any upper front teeth,\r\nfor in place of them the Sheep have only a hard pad of flesh.\r\n\r\nSoon they came running back to the flock. "There is a Dog over there,"\r\nthey cried, "a strange Dog. He doesn\'t look like Collie. He is coming\r\nthis way, and we are afraid."\r\n\r\nTheir uncle, the Bell-Wether, looked over to where the strange Dog was,\r\nthen turned quickly and began to run. The bell around his neck clinked\r\nat every step. When the other Sheep heard the bell they raised their\r\nheads and ran after him, and the Lambs ran after them. The strange Dog\r\ndid not follow or even bark at them, yet on they went, shaking the\r\nshining rain-drops from the grass as they trod upon it. Not one of them\r\nwas thinking for himself what he really ought to do. The Bell-Wether\r\nthought, "I feel like running away from the Dog, and so I will run."\r\n\r\nThe other Sheep said to themselves, "The Bell-Wether is running and so\r\nwe will run."\r\n\r\nAnd the Lambs said, "If they are all running we will run."\r\n\r\nAlong the fence they went, the bell clinking, their hoofs pattering, and\r\nnot one of them thinking for himself, until they reached a place where\r\nthe fence was blown over. It was not blown \'way down, but leaned so that\r\nit could be jumped. If a single one of the flock, even the youngest\r\nLamb, had said, "Don\'t jump!" they would have stayed in the pasture; but\r\nnobody said it. The Bell-Wether felt like jumping over, so he jumped.\r\nThen the Sheep did as the Bell-Wether had done, and the Lambs did as the\r\nSheep had done.\r\n\r\nNow they were in the road and the Bell-Wether turned away from the\r\nfarmhouse and ran on, with the Sheep and the Lambs following. Even now,\r\nif anybody had said, "Stop!" they would have stopped, for they knew that\r\nthey were doing wrong; but nobody said it.\r\n\r\nAfter a while a heavy wagon came rumbling down the road behind them, and\r\nthe Bell-Wether jumped over a ditch and ran into a hilly field with\r\nwoodland beyond. Because he went the Sheep did, and because the Sheep\r\nwent the Lambs did, and nobody said "Stop!" You see, by this time they\r\nwere very badly frightened, and no wonder. When they saw the strange Dog\r\nthey were a little scared, for they thought he might chase them. If they\r\nhad made themselves stay there and act brave they would soon have felt\r\nbrave. Even if the Dog had been a cruel one, they could have kept him\r\nfrom hurting them, for Sheep have been given very strong, hard foreheads\r\nwith which to strike, and the Bell-Wether had also long, curled horns\r\nwith three ridges on the side of each. But it is with Sheep as it is\r\nwith other people,--if they let themselves be frightened they grow more\r\nand more fearful, even when there is no real danger and now all of their\r\ntrouble came from their not stopping to think what they ought to do.\r\n\r\nThey hurried up to the highest ground in the field, and when they were\r\nthere and could go no farther, they stopped and looked at each other.\r\nOne Lamb said to his mother, "Why did we come here? It isn\'t nearly so\r\nnice as our own meadow."\r\n\r\n"Why, I came because the Bell-Wether did," she answered. Then she turned\r\nto the Bell-Wether and said, "Why did you bring us here?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t bring you here," he replied. "I felt like coming, and I came.\r\nI didn\'t make you follow."\r\n\r\n"N-no," answered the Sheep; "but you might have known that if you came\r\nthe Sheep would come."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Bell-Wether, "you might have known that if you Sheep\r\ncame the Lambs would, so you\'d better not say anything."\r\n\r\n"Baa!" cried the Lambs. "We are hot and thirsty and there isn\'t any\r\nwater here to drink. We want to go back."\r\n\r\nEverybody was out of patience with somebody else, and nobody was\r\ncomfortable. They did not dare try to go home again, for fear they would\r\nhave more trouble, so they huddled together on the top of the hill and\r\nwere very miserable and unhappy. They hadn\'t any good reason for coming,\r\nand they could not even have told why they ran to the hilltop instead of\r\nstaying in the pleasant hollow below.\r\n\r\nThere was a reason for their running up, however, although\r\nthey didn\'t know it. It was because their\r\ngreat-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather and-grandmother were\r\nwild Sheep in the mountains, and when frightened ran up among the rocks\r\nwhere there was nobody to hurt them. They got into the habit of running\r\nup-hill when scared, and their children did the same, and their\r\nchildren\'s children did the same, and now even the farmyard Sheep do so,\r\nalthough they long ago forgot the reason why.\r\n\r\n"Bow-wow-wow!" rang out on the still morning air.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Collie!" cried the Lambs joyfully. "He\'s coming to take us\r\nhome. Let\'s bleat to help him find us more quickly." All the Lambs said,\r\n"Baa! Baaa!" in their high, soft voices, and their mothers said "Baa!\r\nBaaa!" more loudly; and the Bell-Wether added his "Baa! Baaa!" which was\r\nso deep and strong that it sounded like a little, very little, clap of\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\nCollie came frisking along with his tail waving and his eyes gleaming.\r\nHe started the flock home, and scolded them and made fun of them all the\r\nway, but they were now so happy that they didn\'t care what he said. When\r\nthey were safely in the home meadow again and the farmer had mended the\r\nfence, Collie left them. As he turned to go, he called back one last\r\npiece of advice.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a Shepherd Dog," he said, "and it\'s my work to take care of Sheep\r\nwhen they can\'t take care of themselves, but I\'d just like to be a\r\nBell-Wether for a little while. You wouldn\'t catch me doing every\r\nfoolish thing I felt like doing and getting all the flock into trouble\r\nby following me! Nobody can do anything without somebody else doing it\r\ntoo, and I wouldn\'t lead people into trouble and then say I didn\'t\r\nthink. Bow-wow-wow-wow!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLLIE AND THE BELL-WETHER.]\r\n\r\nThe Bell-Wether grumbled to himself, "Well, the rest needn\'t tag along\r\nunless they want to. Pity if I can\'t jump a fence without everybody\r\nfollowing." But down in his heart he felt mean, for he knew that one who\r\nleads should do right things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINE YOUNG RAT AND THE TRAP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mice were having a great frolic in the corn-crib. The farmer\'s man\r\nhad carelessly left a board leaning up against it in such a way that\r\nthey could walk right up and through one of the big cracks in the side.\r\nIt was the first time that some of them had ever been here. When the\r\nfarmer built the crib, he had put a tin pan, open side down, on top of\r\neach of the wooden posts, and had then nailed the floor beams of the\r\ncrib through these pans. That had kept the hungry Mice from getting into\r\nthe corn.\r\n\r\nThis was a great day for them, and their gnawing-teeth would certainly\r\nbe worn down enough without giving them any extra wear. That, you know,\r\nis one thing about which all Rats and Mice have to be very careful, for\r\ntheir front teeth are growing all the time, and they have to gnaw hard\r\nthings every day to keep them from becoming too long.\r\n\r\nThere was only one thing that ever really troubled these Mice, and that\r\nwas the Cat. They did not feel afraid of Hawks and Owls because they\r\nlived indoors. Weasels did not often come up to the barn, and men made\r\nso much noise when they were around that any wide-awake Mouse could\r\neasily keep out of their way. With the Cat it was different. She was\r\nalways prowling around in the night-time, just when they had their\r\nfinest parties; and many a young Mouse had been scared away from a\r\nmidnight supper by seeing her eyes glowing like balls of fire in the\r\ndarkness. By daylight it was not so bad, for they could see her coming,\r\nand besides, she slept much of the time then.\r\n\r\nThey were talking about her when in the corn-crib. "Have any of you seen\r\nthe Cat to-day?" asked the Oldest Mouse.\r\n\r\nNobody answered. Then one young fellow, who was always worrying, said:\r\n"Supposing she should come out of the barn now! Supposing she should\r\ncome right toward this corn-crib! Supposing she should stand right under\r\nthe floor! Supposing she should catch us as we jumped down!\r\nSupposing----"\r\n\r\nBut here the other young Mice all squeaked to him to stop, and one of\r\nthem declared that it made her fur stand on end to think of it. The\r\nOldest Mouse spoke quite sharply. "Supposing," said he to the first\r\nyoung Mouse, "you should eat more and talk less. There are enough\r\npleasant things to speak about without scaring all your friends in this\r\nway."\r\n\r\nThe young Mouse who said that her fur stood on end couldn\'t eat anything\r\nmore, she was so frightened. "What could we do," she said, "if the Cat\r\nshould come?"\r\n\r\n"Stay right where we are," answered her mother. "She couldn\'t reach us\r\nwith the door closed. Now go on with your eating and don\'t be foolish."\r\n\r\nA Rat ran up the board. "Good-morning," said he. "Have you heard the\r\nnews?"\r\n\r\n"No, no!" cried the Mice, hurrying to that side of the corn-crib, and\r\npeeping through the crack.\r\n\r\n"The Yellow Kitten has been hunting with her mother, and they say that\r\nher brother is going to-night."\r\n\r\n"Well," said a mother Mouse, "I knew we would have to expect it, but I\r\ndid hope they would wait a while. Now, children," she added, "do be\r\ncareful! I know that when you are looking for food you have to go into\r\ndangerous places, but don\'t stop there to talk or to clean your fur.\r\nFind safe corners for that, or I shall worry about you all the time."\r\n\r\n"We will," squeaked all the little Mice together. "We will be very, very\r\ncareful."\r\n\r\n"Thank you for the news," said the Oldest Mouse to the Rat. "We will try\r\nto send you word of new dangers when we hear of them."\r\n\r\nThe Rat, who was a fine young fellow, ran down the board and away. They\r\ncould not ask him in to lunch, because he was too large and stout to\r\nsqueeze through the cracks, but he understood how it was, and knew that\r\nhe could find food elsewhere. Now he ran to the Pig-pen to snatch a\r\nshare of the breakfast which the farmer had just left there. He often\r\ndid this as soon as the farmer went away, and the Pigs never troubled\r\nhim. Perhaps that was because they knew that if they drove him away when\r\nhe came alone, he would bring all his sisters and his cousins and his\r\naunts, and his brothers and his uncles too, the next time, and would\r\neat every bit of food they had.\r\n\r\nAfter he had taken a hearty breakfast, he ran under the edge of the barn\r\nto clean himself. He was always very particular about this. His mother\r\nhad taught him when very small that he must keep his fur well brushed\r\nand his face washed, and he did it just as a Cat would, by wetting his\r\npaws and scrubbing his face and the top of his head. He brushed his fur\r\ncoat with his paws also.\r\n\r\nWhile he was here, one of his cousins came from the barn above. She ran\r\ndown the inside of the wall, head foremost, and her hind feet were\r\nturned around until they pointed backward. That let her hold on with her\r\nlong, sharp claws, quite as a Squirrel does, and kept her from tumbling.\r\nShe was much out of breath when she reached the ground, but it was not\r\nfrom running.\r\n\r\n"What do you think that farmer has done now?" she cried. "It was bad\r\nenough for him to nail tin over the holes we gnawed into his grain-bins,\r\nbut this is worse still. It needn\'t make us so much trouble, but it\r\nhurts my feelings."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked her cousin.\r\n\r\n"A trap!" said she. "A horrible, shining trap. The Rat from the other\r\nfarm told me about it. It lies open and flat on the floor of a\r\ngrain-bin,--the very one you and I gnawed into last night,--and there is\r\na lovely piece of cheese in the middle of it. The Rat who told me about\r\nit says that as soon as one touches the cheese, the trap springs shut on\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Bah!" exclaimed the young Rat who had just eaten breakfast in the\r\nPig-pen. "Let it stay there! We don\'t have to touch it, although I do\r\nmean to look at it some time. I believe in knowing about things."\r\n\r\n"I wish you wouldn\'t look at it," said his cousin, who was very fond of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"The Rat from the other farm says it is very dangerous to even look at\r\ntraps, especially if your stomach is empty."\r\n\r\n"Then the Rat from the other farm might better keep away," said this\r\nyoung fellow, as he put one paw up to see that his whiskers were all\r\nright. "I don\'t think very much of him anyway. He thinks he knows\r\neverything because he has travelled. I wish you would have nothing to do\r\nwith him. I dare say you were in the grain-bin with him when you saw the\r\ntrap."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said she, "I was."\r\n\r\n"Well," said he, "you both got away safely, and I shall too. I may not\r\nbe very clever, but I think I do know enough to keep out of a trap."\r\nThen he turned into his hole and went to sleep. He had been running\r\naround all night, and was very tired. He was cross, too. This was the\r\nsecond time that his cousin had told him what the Rat from the other\r\nfarm had said, and he thought she liked him altogether too well.\r\n\r\nWhen he awakened, it was night again and he was aroused by the stamping\r\nof the Dappled Gray on the floor above his head. For a minute he could\r\nhardly think where he was. Then it all came to him. He was in his own\r\ncozy little hole under the barn, and it was night. He remembered\r\nsomething about the Yellow Kitten. What was it? Oh yes, she had begun\r\nhunting. Well, he was not afraid of her yet. But there was something\r\nelse--the trap! He wondered if his cousin were in that bin again. As\r\nlike as not her friend, the Rat from the other farm, was showing her the\r\ntrap now. He would go up there himself, and at once, too.\r\n\r\nHe ran up the wall, through an opening, and across the barn floor to the\r\ngrain-bin. It was a moonlight night and the barn was not very dark. The\r\ncover of the bin was raised. Perhaps the farmer\'s man had forgotten to\r\nclose it. Perhaps there was so little grain left in it that the man\r\ndidn\'t care to. At any rate, he could now see the trap quite plainly.\r\nThere was nobody else in the bin, and he went close to it.\r\n\r\n"I would not touch it for anything," said he, as he entered the bin,\r\n"but it will not hurt me to look at it."\r\n\r\nWhen he went nearer, he was very careful to see that his tail did not\r\neven brush against the chain which held the trap down. "So that is the\r\nterrible, dangerous trap?" said he. "It doesn\'t look particularly\r\ndreadful. That is fine-smelling cheese though." He sniffed two or three\r\ntimes. "I have tasted cheese only once in my whole life," said he, "and\r\nI am almost starved now. I wouldn\'t mind a nibble at that." He looked at\r\nit and thought about it until it seemed to him he could not go away and\r\nleave that cheese there.\r\n\r\nThen he thought, "If I am very careful to step over these shining steel\r\nthings and rest my feet only on the floor, it cannot spring the trap.\r\nThen I will snatch the cheese and jump.... I am pretty sure I can do\r\nit.... Why, yes, I know I can." So the Rat who had come just to look at\r\nthe trap, began to lift first one foot and then another over the shining\r\ncurved bars, and got all ready to catch up the cheese and run.\r\n\r\n"Now!" he cried. "One, two, three!" He did snatch it and jump, but the\r\ntrap jumped, too, in its own trappy way, and the Rat who got the cheese\r\nleft the three tip rings of his tail to pay for it. "Ouch!" he cried.\r\n"My tail! My tail! My beautiful, long, bony tail, all covered with\r\nscales and short hair!" He did not care at all for the cheese now. He\r\ndid not want to see it, for he would rather have had the point on his\r\ntail again than to eat a whole binful of cheese.\r\n\r\n"How it will look!" said he. "So stumpy and blunt. And it has been so\r\nvery useful always. I could wind it around a stick to hold myself up\r\nwhen my paws were full, and many a time I have rolled eggs across the\r\nfloor by curling it around them." Then he heard Rat voices and scampered\r\nout and down to his own hole.\r\n\r\nHis cousin and the Rat from the other farm came into the bin. "Don\'t\r\nlook at the trap," he was saying, "but just eat your grain from the\r\nfarther corner."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t," she answered, and she half closed her eyes to keep from\r\nseeing it. He was beside her and they stumbled over the cheese, which\r\nnow lay on the floor away from the trap. "How does this happen?" said\r\nhe. "We will eat it first and then find out." By this advice he showed\r\nthat he was a Rat of excellent sense.\r\n\r\nWhen they had eaten it, they began to look toward the trap. As there was\r\nno longer any cheese in it to tempt them, they felt perfectly safe in\r\ndoing so. They found that it had been sprung, and there lay the last\r\nthree rings of some Rat\'s tail.\r\n\r\n"How dreadful!" she exclaimed. "I hope that was not lost by any of our\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\n"Hum-hum!" said the Rat from the other farm. "Now, whom have I seen\r\nwearing that? I have certainly seen that tail before--it was your\r\ncousin!"\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow!" said she. "I must go to see him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t go now," cried the Rat from the other farm. "I think he might\r\nwant to be alone for a while. Besides," he added coaxingly, "you haven\'t\r\ntasted of the grain yet, and it is very good."\r\n\r\n"W-well," answered she, "perhaps my cousin would just as soon not have\r\nme come now." So she waited, and the Rat from the other farm told her\r\nwonderful stories of his travels, and they had a very fine supper.\r\n\r\nWhen her cousin began to run around again, he was a much sadder and\r\nwiser Rat. Sometimes the younger Rats would ask him how he lost the tip\r\nof his tail. "By not turning it toward a tempting danger," he would\r\nanswer, very solemnly. Then, after he had told them the story, he always\r\nadded, "The time to turn your tail toward a tempting danger is the\r\nminute you see it, for if you wait and look and long for something you\r\nought not to take, there is sure to be trouble, and many a Rat has lost\r\nmore than the tip of his tail in just that way."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUICK-TEMPERED TURKEY GOBBLER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was only one Gobbler on the farm, and he was so used to having his\r\nown way that he never tried to make the best of it when he couldn\'t, and\r\nsometimes he became exceedingly cross. He was bigger than the Cocks, the\r\nHens, the Geese, and the Ducks, so when they were in his way and he\r\ngobbled a gruff "Move along," they murmured "Oh, certainly," and\r\nscampered away as fast as their legs would carry them. The Peacock was\r\nlarger than the Turkey Gobbler, it is true, but as long as he could sit\r\non a fence in the sunshine and have somebody admiring his train, he did\r\nnot care anything about the Gobbler, and they did not get in each\r\nother\'s way.\r\n\r\nThere were seven Hen Turkeys, timid, sweet-tempered people, who were\r\nfond of walking. They had never been known to answer back when the\r\nGobbler scolded them, although at times he was very unreasonable. This\r\nwas polite of them, but it made the Gobbler more careless than ever of\r\nthe way in which he spoke. The Black Spanish Hen said it made her\r\nwattles tingle to hear him find fault with them. She wouldn\'t have stood\r\nit--no, indeed!\r\n\r\nWhen the Black Spanish Cock heard her say so, he shook his feathers and\r\nsmiled a queer little smile, and said, "I certainly know that she would\r\nnot." The other fowls looked at each other, and the Shanghai Cock winked\r\nhis round little eyes at the Dorking Hen, and she had to oil a feather\r\non the under side of her wing just then, so, of course, nobody saw her\r\nlaugh--if she did laugh.\r\n\r\nThe Black Spanish fowls were kind-hearted and honest, and had fine\r\nmanners, but they would not stand it to be spoken to hastily by any one\r\nwho was not very much bigger than they, and it was said that the Cock\r\nhad once--only once--but then, perhaps it would be just as well not to\r\ntell what the other fowls had heard about their family quarrel, for,\r\nafter all, it did not come very straight, the Pigs having told the\r\nGeese, and the Geese telling the Ducks, and the Ducks just mentioning it\r\nto the Peacock, and the Peacock having spoken of it to the Dorking Hen.\r\n\r\nIt was now late in the fall, and all the Turkeys went walking together\r\nagain. One would think that, after being separated from the rest all\r\nsummer and part of the spring, the Gobbler would have been very polite\r\nwhen he joined them, but no; he was more quick-tempered than ever. He\r\nwas not fond of young Turkeys, and their constant chattering annoyed\r\nhim. "Can\'t you find some way to keep those children quiet?" he would\r\nsay, and made such a fuss that the Hen Turkeys called them aside and\r\ntried to amuse them for a while.\r\n\r\nHen Turkeys are most loving mothers, and in the early spring first one\r\nand then another had stolen away to lay and hatch her eggs. If a Hen\r\nTurkey wanted a chance to lay an egg at this season, she watched the\r\nGobbler and left the flock when his back was turned. As she came near\r\nher nest, she would stop and look around to make sure he did not see\r\nwhere it was. She knew that the Gobbler did not like to have her raise\r\nyoung Turkeys, and that if he could find the nest, he would break every\r\negg in it. After she had laid her egg, she would wander back in a\r\ncareless way, quite as though she had only been to the watering-trough\r\nfor a drink.\r\n\r\nOnce the Hen Turkeys had talked about this when the Gobbler could not\r\nhear. "It doesn\'t seem right not to tell him," the youngest had said.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," said another, "it is the only way we can do, if we want\r\nto save our eggs and raise our children. Gobblers always act in that\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure?" said the young Hen Turkey.\r\n\r\n"Sure!" was the answer. "You wouldn\'t be here to-day if your mother\r\nhadn\'t done as we do."\r\n\r\nSo the youngest Hen Turkey had changed her mind and hidden her eggs like\r\nthe rest, for, in spite of aching legs and all that is hard in hatching\r\neggs, Hen Turkeys always want to raise broods in the springtime. When\r\none of them had laid as many eggs as she wanted to hatch, she began\r\nsitting on them, and would not walk with the flock at all. One by one\r\nthe Hen Turkeys had done this until the Gobbler was left quite alone. He\r\ndid not like it at all, and wanted more than ever to find and break the\r\neggs. When the Turkey Chicks were hatched, their mothers kept them out\r\nof the Gobbler\'s way, because, you know, he did not like small children\r\nand it was better that they should not meet.\r\n\r\nThe Hen Turkeys were very sorry for him, and often wished that he might\r\nwatch with them the growth of their piping darlings, to see the tiny\r\nfeathers push their way through the down and broaden and lengthen until\r\nthere was no down to be seen--only feathers. It was too bad; yet that\r\nwas the way in all Turkey families, and the Gobblers couldn\'t help\r\ndisliking the children any more than the Hen Turkeys could help wanting\r\nto sit in the springtime.\r\n\r\nBy another year the Gobbler would love the young Turkeys dearly. Even\r\nnow he did not try to strike them, as he might have done a while before.\r\nThey were afraid of him, yet down in their hearts the brothers all\r\nthought that when they were grown up they wanted to be just like him\r\nand strut around with their wings trailing, their tails spread, their\r\nnecks drawn back, and their feathers ruffled. Then, they thought, when\r\nother people came near them, they would puff and gobble and cry, "Get\r\nout of my way!" They tried it once in a while to see how it would seem,\r\nbut they were still slender and their voices were not yet deep enough.\r\nThe sisters laughed at them when they did this, and that made them feel\r\nvery uncomfortable. The long, limp red wattles that grew out between\r\ntheir eyes became redder and redder as they swung to and fro under their\r\nshort, thick bills.\r\n\r\n"Just wait," said one young fellow to another. "Just you wait until I am\r\nreally grown up and strut before your sister next spring. I don\'t think\r\nshe will laugh at me then." And he comforted himself by eating fully\r\ntwice as much grain as he should have done.\r\n\r\nThe farmer\'s little girl came into the farmyard, and all the fowls\r\nstopped eating to look at her. She was so young that she had never\r\nbefore been out there alone. Her father had brought her in his arms, and\r\nshe had laughed with delight and clapped her little hands when the\r\nfarmyard people passed by her. Now she had slipped out of the house and\r\nstood in the sunshine smiling at every one. She came without a cap, and\r\nthe wind blew her soft yellow curls around her rosy face. It fluttered\r\nher red dress, too, and the Gobbler saw it and became exceedingly angry.\r\n\r\n"Red-red-red!" he cried. "Why in the world did she wear red? I hate it!"\r\nHe stalked toward her in his most disagreeable way, and you could tell\r\nby the stiff brushing of his wing-tips on the ground that he was very\r\nangry. "Get away from here!" he cried. "This is my home and little girls\r\ncan\'t wear red dresses when they visit me. Pffff! Get away!"\r\n\r\nThe little girl turned to run as the big Gobbler came puffing toward\r\nher. In her fright she stumbled and fell, and he hurried forward to\r\nstrike her. The Black Spanish Cock began to ruffle his neck feathers and\r\nstretch his head forward. He did not mean to have their visitor treated\r\nso. He ran between the Gobbler\'s feet and they tumbled over together.\r\nThe little girl picked herself up and hurried into the house.\r\n\r\nIf the Gobbler was angry before, he was much more so after his fall.\r\n"What do you mean, sir," he said, "by tripping me?"\r\n\r\n"And what do you mean," said the Black Spanish Cock, "by knocking me\r\nover?"\r\n\r\n"Pffff! You were under my feet."\r\n\r\n"Erruuuu! You were over my head."\r\n\r\nNow nobody had dared to disagree with the Gobbler in so long that he did\r\nnot know what to make of it, and when the Shanghai Cock strolled over\r\nto help his friend, the Gobbler was fairly sputtering with rage. "Ah,\r\nGobbler," said the Shanghai, "wonder what has become of the little girl?\r\nIt was nice of her to come out here, and I wish she had stayed longer."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BIG GOBBLER CAME PUFFING TOWARD HER.]\r\n\r\n"I told her to get away," was the answer. "She had on a red dress. I\r\nchased her. I always have chased anybody who wore red, and I always\r\nshall. It\'s my way."\r\n\r\n"Is it your way, too, to be cross whenever you feel like it?"\r\n\r\n"Of course. I wouldn\'t be cross when I didn\'t feel like it," answered\r\nthe Gobbler.\r\n\r\n"Some of us are not cross when we do feel like it," said the Dorking\r\nCock. "I am always happier for keeping my temper when I can."\r\n\r\n"Pffff!" said the Gobbler. "That is not my way. I say right out what I\r\nthink, and then I am all right again and forget all about it."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said the Bantam Hen. "I wonder if the other people forget as\r\nsoon? It would do him more good to remember it and feel sorry. He needs\r\na lesson." Then she stalked up to him, looking as brave as you please,\r\nalthough she was really quite frightened. "I never noticed it before,"\r\nshe cackled, "but the tuft of hairy feathers on your breast is\r\ndreadfully ragged. And what very ugly looking feet you have! If I were\r\ngoing to have any webs between my toes I should want good big ones like\r\nthose of the Ducks and Geese, not snippy little halfway webs like yours.\r\nI hope you don\'t mind my speaking of it. I always say what I think. It\'s\r\njust my way, and I never remember it afterward." She gave a graceful\r\nflutter and a queer little squawk, and was off before the Gobbler got\r\nover his surprise.\r\n\r\nFowls do enjoy a joke, and now the Dorking Cock took his turn. "I\'ve\r\nalways wanted to know how you spread your tail in that fashion. It\'s a\r\ngood time to see." He walked up beside the Gobbler and pecked and pulled\r\nuntil three feathers lay on the ground. "Ah," said the Dorking Cock, "I\r\nsee I loosened some of your tail feathers. I hope you don\'t mind. It is\r\njust my way, when I want to know about anything, to find out as soon as\r\nI can."\r\n\r\nAnd so one fowl after another teased and troubled the Gobbler, and\r\nexplained afterward that "it was just their way." Then they laughed at\r\nhim and ran off.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if one could say that the Gobbler never again lost his\r\ntemper, but he did, a great many times, for he should have begun to\r\nmaster it when he was a Chick. But one can tell truly that he never\r\nagain excused his crossness by saying that "it was only his way." The\r\nyoungest Duckling in the poultry-yard had always known that this was no\r\nexcuse at all, and that if people have disagreeable habits which make\r\nothers unhappy, it is something of which they should be much ashamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRAGGING PEACOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farmyard people will never forget the coming of the Peacock; or\r\nrather they will never forget the first day that he spent with them. He\r\ncame in the evening after all the fowls had gone to roost, and their\r\nfour-legged friends were dozing comfortably in meadow and pasture\r\ncorners, so nobody saw him until the next morning.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine how surprised they were when a beautiful great fowl of\r\ngreenish-blue strutted across the yard, holding his head well in the air\r\nand dragging his splendid train behind him. The fowls were just starting\r\nout for their daily walks, and they stopped and held one foot in the\r\nair, and stared and stared and stared. They did not mean to be rude,\r\nbut they were so very much surprised that they did not think what they\r\nwere doing. Most of them thought they were asleep and dreaming, and the\r\ndream was such a beautiful one that they did not want to move and break\r\nit off. They had never seen a Peacock and did not even know that there\r\nwas such a fowl.\r\n\r\nA Lamb by the pasture fence called to his mother. "Ba-baa!" cried he.\r\n"One of the cloud-birds is walking in the farmyard." He was thinking of\r\nthe night of the storm, when all the Sheep and Lambs huddled together in\r\nthe meadow and watched the clouds, and thought that they were birds and\r\ndropped shining worms from their beaks.\r\n\r\nThen the Peacock, who understood the Sheep language perfectly, said,\r\n"Paon! I am no cloud-bird. I am a Peacock." He said this in a very\r\nhaughty way, as though to be a Peacock were the grandest thing in the\r\nworld, far better than having one\'s home in the sky and bringing showers\r\nto refresh the thirsty earth-people.\r\n\r\nThe Turkey Gobbler never could stand it to have others speak in that way\r\nwhen he was around, so he thought he would show the newcomer how\r\nimportant he was. He drew up his neck and puffed out his chest; he\r\npulled his skin muscles by thinking about them, and that made his\r\nfeathers stand on end; next he dropped his wings until their tips\r\ntouched the ground; then he slowly spread his tail. "Pffff!" said he. "I\r\nam no Peacock. I am a Turkey Gobbler."\r\n\r\nThe Hen Turkeys looked at each other with much pride. They were a little\r\nafraid of him themselves, but they liked to have him show the newcomer\r\nthat Turkeys are important people. Their children looked at each other\r\nand murmured, "Isn\'t the Gobbler fine though? Guess the Peacock will\r\nwish now that he hadn\'t put on airs."\r\n\r\nBut the Peacock did not seem to feel at all sorry. He stood and looked\r\nat them all without saying a word, and they all wondered what he was\r\nthinking. Then a Duckling who stood near him exclaimed, "Look at his\r\ntrain! Oh, look at his train!" Everybody looked and saw all those\r\nbeautiful long feathers rising into the air. Up and up they went, and\r\nspreading as they rose, until there was a wonderful great circle of them\r\nback of his body and reaching far above his head. The Gobbler\'s spread\r\ntail looked as small beside this as a Dove\'s egg would beside that of a\r\nGoose.\r\n\r\n"Paon!" said the Peacock. "I am no Turkey Gobbler. I am a Peacock."\r\n\r\n"Pffff!" said the Gobbler. Then he turned to the Hen Turkeys. "My\r\ndears," he said, "I think it is time that we walked along. The children\r\nshould not be allowed to see and speak with any stray fowl that comes\r\nalong. We cannot be too particular about that." Then he stalked off,\r\nwith the meek Hen Turkeys following and the children lagging behind.\r\nThey did so want to stay and see the Peacock, and they thought the\r\nDucklings and Goslings were much luckier than they.\r\n\r\nThe Geese were delighted with the newcomer, and hoped he would be quite\r\nfriendly with them. They wished he were a swimmer, but of course they\r\ncould tell with one look that he was not. He did not have the trim,\r\nboat-shaped body that swimmers have, and then, his feet were not webbed.\r\nThe Gander noticed that they were remarkably homely feet. He thought he\r\nwould remember this and speak of it to the Geese some time when they\r\nwere praising the Peacock\'s train.\r\n\r\nThe Drake was the first to speak politely to the Peacock. "We are glad\r\nto meet you, sir," he said. "Will you be with us long?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you," answered the Peacock. "I have come to stay."\r\n\r\n"We hope you will like it here. I\'m sorry to see you do not swim. We\r\nshould be very glad of your company if you did. You will excuse us if we\r\ngo on to the brook. We are late already." He and all of his family\r\nwaddled away to the water. "A fine-looking fellow," said he heartily.\r\n"Even my cousins, the Mallard Ducks, have not such a beautiful sheen on\r\ntheir neck feathers." The Drake was a kind, warm-hearted fellow, and it\r\nnever troubled him to know that other people were handsomer than he.\r\n\r\nThe Geese were eager to reach the water, too, but they could not leave\r\nwithout asking one question. First they told the Gander to ask it, but\r\nhe replied that if they wanted to know, they should ask it for\r\nthemselves. Then they hung back and said to each other, "You ask him. I\r\ncan\'t." At last the Gray Goose stepped forward, saying, "Excuse us,\r\nsir. You said that you were to stay with us, and we wish to know if you\r\nwork for your living."\r\n\r\n"I work!" cried he. "Paon! Never. The farmer invited me here to be\r\nbeautiful, that is all."\r\n\r\n"We are so glad," cackled the Geese, and the Gander joined with them.\r\n"So many of the people here work. They are very good, but not at all\r\ngenteel, you understand."\r\n\r\n"And don\'t you do anything?" asked the Peacock. "I thought Geese grew\r\nfeathers for beds and pillows. It seems to me you look rather ragged.\r\nHaven\'t you been plucked?"\r\n\r\nThis was very embarrassing to the Geese. "Why, yes," they said, "we do\r\nlet the farmer\'s wife have some feathers once in a while, when the\r\nweather is warm, but that is very different from really working, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said the Peacock. "If they want any of my feathers, they can\r\nwait until I moult. Then you will see how much they think of me, for\r\nwhenever they find one of my train feathers (not tail, if you please;\r\nevery bird has a tail, but I have a train) they carry it carefully into\r\nthe house to be made into a duster for the parlor. I never give away any\r\nbut my cast-off plumage. I am so very, very beautiful that I do not have\r\nto work."\r\n\r\nThis impressed the Geese very much. "We are glad to know you. Quite\r\nhonored, we assure you!"\r\n\r\nThe Peacock bowed his crested head, and they bowed their uncrested and\r\nvery silly ones, and then they went to the river. The Peacock thought\r\nthem most agreeable, because they admired him, and they thought him the\r\nbest sort of acquaintance, because he didn\'t work. It was all very\r\nfoolish, but there are always foolish people in the world, you know, and\r\nit is much better to be amused by it and a little sorry for them, than\r\nfor us to lose our tempers and become cross about it. That was the way\r\nthe Shanghais, Black Spanish, Dorking, and Bantam fowls felt. They were\r\npolite enough to the newcomer, but they did not run after him. The\r\nChickens used to laugh when the Peacock uttered his cry of "Paon! Paon!"\r\nHis voice was harsh and disagreeable, and it did seem so funny to hear\r\nsuch dreadful sounds coming from such a lovely throat.\r\n\r\nThe Black Spanish Cock reproved the Chickens sharply for this. "It is\r\nvery rude," said he, "to laugh at people for things they cannot help.\r\nHow would you like to have a Lamb follow you around and bleat, \'Look at\r\nthat Chicken! He has only two legs! Hello, little two-legs; how can you\r\nwalk?\' It is just as bad for you to laugh at his harsh voice, because he\r\ncannot help it. If he should say foolish and silly things, you might\r\nlaugh, because he could help that if he tried. Don\'t ever again let me\r\nhear you laughing when he is just saying \'Paon.\'"\r\n\r\nThe Chickens minded the Black Spanish Cock, for they knew he was right\r\nand that he did not do rude things himself. They remembered everything\r\nhe said, too.\r\n\r\nOne day the Peacock was standing on the fence alone. He did this most of\r\nthe time. He usually stood with his back to the farmyard, so that people\r\nwho passed could see his train but not his feet. A party of young fowls\r\nof all families came along. Their mothers had let them go off by\r\nthemselves, and they stopped to look at the Peacock.\r\n\r\n"I do think you have the most beautiful tail, sir," said a Duckling,\r\ngiving her own little pointed one a sideways shake as she spoke.\r\n\r\n"Please call it my train," said the Peacock. "It is beautiful and I am\r\nvery proud of it. Not every fowl can grow such a train as that."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEACOCK WAS STANDING ON THE FENCE.]\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no!" giggled a jolly little Bantam Chicken. "I\'d grow one in\r\na minute if I could."\r\n\r\nThis made all the other young fowls laugh, for they thought how funny\r\nthe little brown Bantam would look dragging around a great mass of\r\nfeathers like that.\r\n\r\nThe Peacock did not even smile. He never understood a joke anyway. He\r\nwas always so busy thinking about himself that he couldn\'t see the\r\npoint. Now he cleared his throat and spoke to the Bantam Chicken.\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t think that I grew my train in a minute," said he. "It\r\ntook me a long, long time, although I kept all the feathers going at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"Look at his crest!" exclaimed one young Turkey in his piping voice.\r\n\r\nThe Peacock turned his head so that they could see it more plainly.\r\n"That is a crest to be proud of," he said. "I have never seen a finer\r\none myself. Have you noticed the beauty of my neck?"\r\n\r\n"Charming!" "Wonderful!" "Beautiful!" exclaimed the young fowls. Just\r\nthen one of the spoiled Dove children flew down from the barn roof and\r\nsat beside the Peacock.\r\n\r\n"What homely feet you have!" this Squab exclaimed. "Are you not\r\ndreadfully ashamed of them?"\r\n\r\nThe young fowls thought this rude. Not one of them would have said it.\r\nThe Peacock became very angry. "I know my feet are not so handsome as\r\nthey might be," he said, "but that is no reason why I should be ashamed\r\nof them. I couldn\'t help having that kind of feet. They run in my\r\nfamily. I don\'t feel ashamed of things I can\'t help."\r\n\r\nThe young fowls felt so uncomfortable after this that they walked away,\r\nand the Squab flew back to the Dove-cote. For a time nobody spoke. Then\r\na Gosling, who had heard her mother talk about the Peacock, said, "I\r\nshould think he would be proud of his train, and his crest, and his\r\nneck, and--and everything!"\r\n\r\n"Everything except his feet," giggled the Bantam Chicken, "and you know\r\nhe couldn\'t help having them."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if he could help having his train, and his crest, and his\r\nneck, and--and everything?" said a young Turkey.\r\n\r\nThey all stopped where they were. "We never thought of that!" they\r\ncried. "We never thought of that!"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go and ask the Blind Horse," said a Duckling. "He is a good\r\nfriend of mine, and he knows almost everything."\r\n\r\nThey stalked and waddled over to the Blind Horse, and the Duckling told\r\nhim what was puzzling them. The Blind Horse laughed very heartily. "So\r\nthe Peacock is proud of having grown such a fine train and crest, but he\r\nisn\'t ashamed of his homely feet, because he couldn\'t help having\r\nthose! There is no reason for either pride or shame with the Peacock. He\r\nhas just such a body as was given him, and he couldn\'t make one feather\r\ngrow differently if he tried."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what anybody can be proud of, then," said a Gosling sadly;\r\nfor, you see, she wanted to be proud of something.\r\n\r\n"Be proud of what you have done yourself," said the Blind Horse gently.\r\n"Be proud of keeping clean, or of telling the truth, or of speaking\r\npleasantly when things go wrong. There are plenty of chances to be proud\r\nin a good way, if one must be proud."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISCONTENTED GUINEA HEN\r\n\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Gobbler, "I should like to know what next! Last spring\r\nit was the White Pig, when we had never had any but black and brown ones\r\non the place. Next it was Ducks, because one of the farmer\'s boys wanted\r\nthem. Then it was the Peacock, to please the farmer\'s wife. Now it is\r\nGuinea Fowls for the farmer\'s other son. Society isn\'t what it used to\r\nbe here, and while some of the new people may be very pleasant, I must\r\nsay that I preferred the good old quiet days."\r\n\r\n"I think it is lovely," cackled the cheerful little Bantam Hen. "One\r\nhears so much of the world outside, and for people like myself, who\r\nstay at home, that is a good thing. Everybody loved the White Pig before\r\nshe had been here two days, and my children are very fond of the\r\nDucklings. I like to have them together, too, for after I had told them\r\npositively that my Chickens could not go in swimming, they stopped\r\nteasing and became most delightful playmates."\r\n\r\n"What would you say about the Peacock?" asked the Shanghai Cock, who had\r\nnever been friendly with him, although, to tell the truth, the Shanghai\r\nCock was not so grumpy as he used to be.\r\n\r\n"Er--er--well," said the Bantam Hen, who tried not to say unpleasant\r\nthings about people unless she really had to, "he--he is certainly\r\nbeautiful, although I can\'t say that I am fond of hearing him sing."\r\n\r\nThis made all the fowls laugh, even the Gobbler looking a little smiling\r\naround the beak on the side where his hanging wattle did not hide his\r\nface. When the Hen Turkeys on the smiling side saw that he was pleased,\r\nthey began to smile too; and then the Hen Turkeys on the other side, who\r\nhadn\'t been sure that it was safe for them to do so, smiled also. And it\r\ndid them all a great deal of good.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t see the Guinea Fowls," said one of the Geese. "We were\r\nswimming when they came. How do they look? Are they handsomely dressed?\r\nWe shall not call upon them unless they are our kind of people." It was\r\nsome time since their last plucking for the season, and the Geese were\r\ngrowing more airy every day now.\r\n\r\n"They are really very peculiar," said the Black Spanish Hen, "and not at\r\nall common-looking. I should call them decidedly genteel." Here the\r\nGeese looked at each other and nodded. They were always talking about\r\nbeing genteel, although if you had asked them, they might not have been\r\nable to tell what they meant by the word. "They are shaped quite like\r\nsmall Hen Turkeys," added the Black Spanish Hen "and their feathers are\r\na dark bluish-gray with round white spots all over them. They do not\r\nwear any feathers on top of their heads. When I saw the first one, I\r\nthought she must have lost hers in an accident, but after the others\r\ncame up, I knew it must be the custom in their family."\r\n\r\n"And they are shaped like us?" asked the Hen Turkeys all together. They\r\nwere thinking that perhaps the Black Spanish Hen would call them\r\ngenteel-looking also, but she didn\'t.\r\n\r\n"Very much like you," she replied. "In fact, I think they said something\r\nabout being related to your family, although I am not sure. Do you\r\nremember, dear?" she said, turning to the Black Spanish Cock.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," he answered. "The Guinea Hen with the orange-colored legs\r\nsaid that their family was related to both the Turkeys and the Peacocks,\r\nand that they were pleased to see members of those families here."\r\n\r\n"Gobble-gobble-gobble," called the Gobbler to the Hen Turkeys. "You must\r\ncall upon our relatives as soon as you can. I will go later. I always\r\nwait to find out more about strangers before calling. It is my way." He\r\ndidn\'t stop to think that if everybody waited as long as he did, the\r\nstrangers would be very lonely.\r\n\r\nAfter this, they scattered to feed, and the Hen Turkeys and their\r\nchildren looked for the Guinea Fowls. "Listen," said one, "and we may\r\nhear them talking to each other." They stood still, with their heads\r\nwell up and turned a little to one side. They heard a harsh voice\r\nsaying, "Ca-mac! Ca-mac!" and as none of their old friends ever said\r\n"Ca-mac!" they knew at once that it was one of the newcomers. They\r\nwalked around the corner of the Sheep-shed, and there found them, a\r\nGuinea Cock and two Guinea Hens. One of the Guinea Hens had\r\norange-colored legs, while the others had dark grayish-brown ones.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning," said the Hen Turkeys. "Are you the Guinea Fowls?"\r\n\r\n"We are," said the one with the bright-colored legs, "and you are the\r\nTurkeys, are you not?"\r\n\r\n"We are the Hen Turkeys," said they, "and these are our children. The\r\nGobbler didn\'t feel that he could come with us this morning, but he will\r\ncome later. He got very tired in Grasshopper season and is hardly over\r\nit yet."\r\n\r\n"That is too bad," said the Guinea Cock politely. "We hope he will soon\r\nbe better. It is a hard time for all Turkeys--so much running to and\r\nfro, besides the stretching of the neck whenever a Grasshopper comes\r\nnear."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he overate somewhat," said one of the Hen Turkeys. "We were\r\nquite worried about him for a time. He slept so poorly and dreamed that\r\nhe was being chased. He always has a good appetite, and you know how it\r\nis when there is so much food around. One cannot let it alone."\r\n\r\nSo they chatted on about one thing and another, and walked as they\r\nvisited. The Guinea Fowls were more fussy and restless than the Turkeys,\r\nand even when they were speaking would run after some dainty bit of food\r\nthat had just caught their eyes. Of course the Hen Turkeys said how glad\r\nthey were to have the Guinea Fowls come there to live, and hoped that\r\nthey would enjoy their new home. All of the farmyard people thought it a\r\nmost delightful place.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," cried the Guinea Hen with the bright-colored legs, "it is\r\nvery pleasant, of course, but I wish you could see the farm we left."\r\n\r\n"Why! Was it better than this?" asked the Turkey Chicks, crowding around\r\nher. They were so surprised that they forgot their mothers\' telling them\r\nthat if they came they must be very quiet, and making them all repeat\r\ntogether, "Little Turkeys should be seen and not heard."\r\n\r\n"Better? My dears, it was not to be spoken of in the same breath. I\r\nunderstand that when one has always lived here, this may seem very nice,\r\nbut when one has known better things, it is hard to be contented."\r\n\r\n"Still, we shall be very happy here, I am sure," said the other Guinea\r\nHen, the one with the brown legs. "People all seem so bright and\r\npleasant. I like it very much indeed."\r\n\r\n"We are glad of that," said the Turkeys all together. "We really must be\r\ngoing. We fear we have stayed too long already. The Gobbler will wonder\r\nif we are never coming back. Good-morning."\r\n\r\nAs they walked off to look for him, one Hen Turkey said to another, "It\r\nmust be hard to come here after living on that farm."\r\n\r\n"Yes," was the answer, "I suppose that we don\'t really know what comfort\r\nis here."\r\n\r\nWhen the Gobbler asked them about the Guinea Fowls, and how they were\r\nenjoying their new home, the Hen Turkeys sighed and answered, "Oh, as\r\nwell as they can enjoy this farm, we suppose." The Gobbler was a little\r\nsurprised by this reply, but he said nothing, and as he pecked at the\r\ncorn which had just been spilled from the load the Oxen were drawing, he\r\nthought, "I wish we could have better corn to eat. This does not taste\r\nquite as it should."\r\n\r\nWhen the Geese met the Guinea Fowls, they began to speak of the pleasure\r\nof living on such a fine farm. "Ah," said the Guinea Hen with the\r\nbright-colored legs, "how I wish you might see the one we left when we\r\ncame here. It was so different."\r\n\r\nThe other Guinea Fowls looked uncomfortable when she spoke in this way,\r\nand stood first on one foot and then on the other. Then the Cock said\r\nsomething about the sunshiny fall weather, and the good neighbors,\r\nand--and----\r\n\r\nThe Gander spoke again of the farm. "It is not all that we could wish,"\r\nsaid he; "still there are some good things about it. There are several\r\nswimming places which are fine and cold in winter."\r\n\r\n"If it were only better cared for," said the Gray Goose. "I had a\r\ndreadful time a while ago, when I tried to get through a hole in the\r\nfence. I don\'t remember what was the matter with the hole, and perhaps I\r\nnever knew, but the farmer should have such things fixed. My neck was\r\nlame for days afterward, and he was wholly to blame."\r\n\r\nAfter this, the Geese found fault with almost everything, and when there\r\nwas no one thing to grumble about, they sighed because, "It was so\r\ndifferent from what it might be." It was not long before even the spring\r\nChickens, the Goslings, and the Ducklings were speaking in the same way,\r\nand the poultry-yard was a most doleful place. The Bantam Hen was the\r\nonly really cheerful fowl there, and she got so tired of hearing the\r\nrest sigh and grumble, that she often slipped between the pickets of the\r\nfence and went to have a comfortable chat with the Oxen.\r\n\r\nOne day she fluttered toward them in a most excited manner. "Do I look\r\nnearly crazy?" said she. "I feel so. Ever since our last storm, the\r\nGuinea Fowls have been shut in with us, and I would give half of my\r\ntail-feathers if they had never come here. That one with the\r\norange-colored legs can\'t see good in anything, and all of our steady,\r\nsensible fowls have heard it until they begin to believe that this farm\r\nis a wretched place."\r\n\r\n"What do they do?" asked the Nigh Ox, who always enjoyed hearing the\r\nBantam Hen talk.\r\n\r\n"Do?" said she, shaking her dainty little head. "They don\'t do much of\r\nanything. That is what is the matter, and the young fowls are the worst\r\nof all. You know how it used to be at feeding time? We all fluttered and\r\nsquabbled for the first chance at the food. Some Hen got the biggest\r\npiece, and then the rest would chase her from one corner to another, and\r\nnot give her a chance to break and swallow any of it until she would\r\nshare with them. It was great fun, and we never left a scrap uneaten.\r\nNow, what do you think?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t imagine," exclaimed the Oxen in one breath.\r\n\r\n"Well, they all stand around on one foot for a while, and I am the only\r\none eating. Then somebody says, \'I wonder if this is any better than\r\nthe last we had.\' Another will groan, \'Oh, is it time to eat again?\' or,\r\n\'Suppose I must eat something to keep up my strength.\' Then I hear the\r\nbright-legged Guinea Hen say, \'Ca-mac! Ca-mac! This is all so different,\r\nso very different from what I have been used to.\' The Cock and the other\r\nHen of that family are nice enough if you only get them away from her."\r\n\r\n"What nonsense!" exclaimed the Oxen together, and they spoke quite\r\nsharply for them.\r\n\r\n"I wish," said the Bantam Hen very slowly, and as though she meant every\r\nword--"I wish the bright-legged one were back where it was \'so\r\ndifferent.\' Perhaps then my friends would begin to act like themselves."\r\n\r\n"Where did she come from?" asked the Off Ox. "It seems to me that I saw\r\na bright-legged Guinea Hen somewhere not long ago." He thought very\r\nhard, so hard that he swallowed his cud without knowing he did so.\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t it at the place where we took that load of stone the other day?"\r\nasked the Nigh Ox, trying to help his brother. He knew how disagreeable\r\nit is not to be able to recall anything of that sort.\r\n\r\n"It was," cried the Off Ox; "and a very poor farm it is. It was the same\r\nHen too. Talk about its being different! I should say it was different\r\nfrom this place, but there are a good many ways of being different.\r\nUm-hum! I think I will talk with the discontented Guinea Hen before\r\nlong, and I want you to see that the other fowls are listening when I\r\ndo."\r\n\r\nAlthough he would say nothing more, the Bantam Hen saw from the look in\r\nhis eyes that he meant to stop the Guinea Hen\'s complaining, so she went\r\naway feeling happier. Then the Off Ox unswallowed his cud and began to\r\nchew it as though nothing had happened. His brother heard him chuckle\r\nonce in a while, and say, "Different!" under his breath.\r\n\r\nWhen the Off Ox awakened from time to time during that night and heard\r\nthe Guinea Hens talking in the dark, he chuckled again to himself. The\r\nGuinea Cock was a sound sleeper, but the Hens always talked a great deal\r\nbetween sunset and sunrise, and especially if it were about to rain.\r\nOther people thought that they might talk more in the daytime and then\r\nkeep quiet when their neighbors wanted to sleep. They declared that they\r\nalways remembered so many things to say as soon as they went to roost,\r\nand that if they waited until morning they might forget more than half.\r\n\r\nThe very next day, the Off Ox had the chance he wanted. He and his\r\nbrother were yoked to the stone-boat and left standing by the\r\npoultry-yard. "Good-afternoon," said he. "Is the bright-legged Guinea\r\nHen here?"\r\n\r\n"I am," she answered, coming close to the pickets.\r\n\r\n"We are just going over to your old home," said he, "with this load of\r\nstone. Have you any messages to send to your friends?"\r\n\r\nThe Guinea Hen looked rather uncomfortable, and stood first on one foot\r\nand then the other. "Tell them I am well," said she.\r\n\r\n"I will," said the Off Ox, in his hearty way. "I will try to tell them\r\nall. I think I can, too, for there did not seem to be many people in\r\nthat farmyard. I didn\'t see Ducks or Geese at all. Are there any living\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the Guinea Hen. She did not seem to think of anything else to\r\nsay, although nobody spoke for a long time.\r\n\r\n"Of course not!" exclaimed the Off Ox. "How stupid of me to ask. There\r\nis no brook or river on that farm."\r\n\r\nStill the Guinea Hen said nothing.\r\n\r\n"We are dragging stone for their new barn," said the Off Ox. "Or perhaps\r\nI should say for their barn. One could hardly say that they have any\r\nyet, although I suppose they use those loosely built sheds for barns. I\r\nwonder people can spend a winter where there are such drafts; still,\r\nhome is always home, and people love it for that reason. We are glad to\r\nhave your family with us, not only to keep away the Crows (which was\r\npart of the Guinea Fowls\' work), but because you will be more\r\ncomfortable. I\'ve never yet in all my travels seen so good a farm as\r\nthis, and the one you left was so different! Good-bye."\r\n\r\nThere was not much talking in the poultry-yard the rest of the\r\nafternoon, although most of the fowls looked happier than they had for\r\nmany days. When supper-time came, the Dorking Hen snatched the biggest\r\npieces of food, and the others chased her from corner to corner in quite\r\nthe old way. Every scrap was eaten, and nobody laughed when the Shanghai\r\nCock said that the fine weather had given him a better appetite. It was\r\nreally a dark and chilly day, but they had stopped thinking how much\r\nbetter off they would be if they only lived somewhere else. As soon as\r\nthey stopped thinking that, they could see how well they were cared for\r\nat home. And so, although nobody had really looked at the sky or thought\r\nabout the weather, everybody had a feeling that the sun must have been\r\nshining.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Guinea Cock and the other Guinea Hen were the happiest of\r\nall, for they had not known what to do or say when the bright-legged one\r\ntalked about her old home. It all seemed like a joke now, yet she never\r\nliked the Off Ox after that day. The other fowls were as nice to her as\r\never, for they knew it was a sad thing to be so discontented, and they\r\nknew, also, that if they had not been foolish enough to let her, she\r\ncould never have made them unhappy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OXEN TALK WITH THE CALVES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a clear, cold winter morning, and the Cattle stood in the\r\nbarnyard where the great yellow straw-stacks were. They had nibbled away\r\nat the lower part of these stacks until there was a sheltered place\r\nunderneath. The Calves liked to stand on the sunshiny side with an\r\nover-hanging ledge of straw above their heads. The wind did not strike\r\nthem here, and they could reach up and pull out wisps to eat when they\r\nhad nothing else to do. Not that they were so fond of eating straw, but\r\nit was fun to pull it out. There was, however, usually something else to\r\nbe done, for there was always their cud to chew.\r\n\r\nAmong all the farmyard people, there were none more particular about\r\ntheir food. They might eat in a hurry when time was short, or when the\r\ngrass was fresh and green, but after they had swallowed it and filled\r\nthe first of their four stomachs with partly chewed food, they would\r\nfind some quiet and comfortable place where they could stand or lie\r\neasily and finish their eating. To do this, they had to bring the partly\r\nchewed food from the first stomach to the mouth again. They called this\r\n"unswallowing it," although they should have said "regurgitating."\r\n\r\nAfter the food was back in their mouths again, it was spoken of as their\r\ncud, and the stout muscles in the sides of their faces pulled their\r\nlower jaws up and down and sideways, and the food was caught over and\r\nover again between the blunt grinding teeth in the back part of their\r\nmouths, and was crushed, squeezed, and turned until it was fine, soft,\r\nand ready to swallow into the second stomach.\r\n\r\nThen the Cattle do not have to think of it again, but while they are\r\ndoing something quite different, and perhaps forgetting all about it,\r\nthere are many nerves and muscles and fine red blood-drops as busy as\r\ncan be, passing it into the third and fourth stomachs, and changing the\r\nstrength of the food into the strength of the Cattle. The Cows and the\r\nOxen do not know this. They never heard of muscles and nerves, and\r\nperhaps you never did before, yet these are wonderful little helpers and\r\ngood friends if one is kind to them. All that Cattle know about eating\r\nis that they must have clean food, that they must eat because they are\r\nhungry and not just because it tastes good, and that they must chew it\r\nvery carefully. And if they do these things as they should, they are\r\nquite sure to be well and comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Oxen were standing by the barn door, and the Calves were talking\r\nabout them. They liked their uncles, the Oxen, very much, but like many\r\nother Calves the world over, they thought them rather slow and\r\nold-fashioned. Now the Colts had been saying the same thing, and so\r\nthese half-dozen shaggy youngsters, who hadn\'t a sign of a horn, were\r\ntelling what they would do if they were Oxen. Sometimes they spoke more\r\nloudly than they meant to, and the Oxen heard them, but they did not\r\nknow this.\r\n\r\n"If I were an Ox," said one, "I wouldn\'t stand still and let the farmer\r\nput that heavy yoke on my neck. I\'d edge away and kick."\r\n\r\n"Tell you what I\'d do," said another. "I\'d stand right still when he\r\ntried to make me go, and I wouldn\'t stir until I got ready."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t do that," said a third. "I\'d run away and upset the stone in\r\na ditch. I don\'t think it\'s fair to always make them pull the heavy\r\nloads while the Horses have all the fun of taking the farmer to town and\r\ndrawing the binder and all the other wonderful machines."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it too bad that you are not Oxen?" said a deep voice behind them.\r\nThe Calves jumped, and there was the Off Ox close to them. He was so\r\nnear that you could not have set a Chicken coop between him and them,\r\nand he had heard every word. The Calves did not know where to look or\r\nwhat to say, for they had not been speaking very politely. The one who\r\nhad just spoken wanted to act easy and as though he did not care, so he\r\nraised one hind hoof to scratch his ear, and gave his brushy tail a toss\r\nover one flank. "Oh, I don\'t know," said he.\r\n\r\n"I used to talk in just that way when I was a Calf," said the Off Ox,\r\nwith a twinkle in his large brown eyes. "All Calves think they\'ll do\r\nwonders when they\'re grown."\r\n\r\n"I know I thought so," said the Nigh Ox, who had followed his brother.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you wanted to," asked the Red Calf, "why don\'t you do those\r\nthings now?" The others wondered how he dared to ask such a question.\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t pay," said the Nigh Ox. "Do all your frisking in playtime. I\r\nlike fun as well as anybody, yet when our yoke is taken from its peg, I\r\nsay business is business and the closer we stick to it the better. I\r\nknew a sitting Hen once who wanted to see everything that happened. She\r\nwas always running out to see somebody or other, and sometimes she\r\nstayed longer than she meant to. I told her she\'d better stick to her\r\nnest, and she said she didn\'t believe in working all the time."\r\n\r\n"How soon did her Chickens hatch?" asked the Calves all together.\r\n\r\n"Never did hatch, of course," chuckled the Nigh Ox. "She fooled herself\r\ninto thinking she was working, and she made a great fuss about her legs\r\naching and her giving up society, but she couldn\'t fool that nestful of\r\neggs. They had gotten cold and they knew it, and not one of them would\r\nhatch."\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t she ashamed then?" asked the Calves.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t act so," snorted the Nigh Ox. "Went around talking about her\r\ngreat disappointment, and said she couldn\'t see why the other Hens had\r\nso much better luck."\r\n\r\nThe Off Ox chuckled. "He told her that he guessed it might have been\r\nsomething besides bad luck, and that the next time she\'d better stay on\r\nher nest more. Then she asked him how many broods of Chickens he had\r\nhatched. Ho-ho-ho!"\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed, and the Calves wondered how the Nigh Ox could think\r\nof it without being angry. "It wouldn\'t pay to be angry," he said.\r\n"What\'s the use of wasting a fine great Ox temper on a poor little Hen\r\nrudeness?"\r\n\r\nThis made them think. They remembered how cross and hot and\r\nuncomfortable they often became over very small things that bothered\r\nthem, and they began to think that perhaps even Calf tempers were worth\r\ncaring for.\r\n\r\nAt last the Black Calf, the prettiest one in the yard, said, "Do you\r\nlike drawing that flat wagon which hasn\'t any wheels, and scrapes along\r\nin the dust?"\r\n\r\n"The stone-boat?" asked the Off Ox. "We don\'t mind it. Never mind doing\r\nour kind of work. Wouldn\'t like to pull the binder with its shining\r\nknives and whirling arms, for whoever does that has to walk fast and\r\nmake sudden turns and stops. Wouldn\'t like being hitched to the carriage\r\nto carry the farmer\'s family to town. Wouldn\'t like to take care of the\r\nSheep, like Collie, or to grow feathers like the Geese--but we can draw\r\nstone-boats and all sorts of heavy loads, if we do say it."\r\n\r\nThe Red Calf, who was always running and kicking up his heels, said,\r\n"Oh, it\'s such slow work! I should think you\'d feel that you would never\r\nreach the end of your journey."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t think about that," answered the Nigh Ox. "It doesn\'t pay. We\r\nused to, though. I remember the time when I wished myself a Swallow,\r\nflying a mile a minute, instead of step-step-stepping my way through\r\nlife. My mother was a sensible Cow, and wore the bell in our herd. She\r\ncured me of that foolishness. She told me that Swallows had to fly one\r\nwing-beat at a time, and that dinners had to be eaten one mouthful at a\r\ntime, and that nothing really worth while could be done in a minute. She\r\nsaid that if we were forever thinking how much work we had to do and\r\nhow tiresome it was, we\'d never enjoy life, and we wouldn\'t live long\r\neither. Lazy Oxen never do. That\'s another thing which doesn\'t pay."\r\n\r\nThe Red Calf and the White Calf spoke together: "We will always be\r\nsensible. We will never lose our tempers. We will never be afraid to\r\nwork. We will be fine and long-lived cattle."\r\n\r\n"Might you not better say you will _try_ to be sensible?" asked the Nigh\r\nOx. "You know it is not always easy to do those things, and one has to\r\nbegin over and over again."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," they answered. "We know what we can do."\r\n\r\n"You might be mistaken," said the Oxen gently.\r\n\r\n"I am never mistaken," said the Red Calf.\r\n\r\n"Neither am I," said the White Calf.\r\n\r\n"Well, good-morning," called the Oxen, as they moved off. "We are going\r\nto talk with our sisters, the Cows."\r\n\r\nAfter they had gone, the pretty Black Calf spoke in her pleasant way:\r\n"It seems to me I shall be an old Cow before I can learn to be good and\r\nsensible like them, but I am going to try."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said the Red Calf. "It is easy enough to be sensible if you want\r\nto be--as easy as eating."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the White Calf. "I shall never lose my temper again, now\r\nthat I am sure it is foolish to do so."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said the pretty Black Calf. "How strong and good you must be.\r\nI can only keep on trying."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said the Red Calf again. Then he lowered his voice and spoke to\r\nher. "Move along," said he, "and let me stand beside you in the cubby\r\nwhile I chew my cud."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you do it," cried the White Calf. "I want that place myself."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RED CALF AND THE WHITE CALF.]\r\n\r\n"I guess not!" exclaimed the Red Calf. "I\'ll bunt you first."\r\n\r\n"Bunt away, then," said the White Calf, "but I\'ll have that place."\r\n\r\n"Oh, please don\'t fight!" exclaimed the Black Calf. "I\'ll let one of you\r\nhave my corner."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you move," cried each of them. "I want to stand by you." Then\r\nthey lowered their heads and looked into each other\'s eyes. Next, they\r\nput their hard foreheads together, and pushed and pushed and pushed.\r\nSometimes the Red Calf made the White Calf go backward, and sometimes it\r\nwas the other way. Once in a while they stood still and rested. Then\r\nthey began pushing again.\r\n\r\nWhile they were quarrelling in this way, getting warmer and more angry\r\nall the time, and losing those very tempers which they had said they\r\nwould always keep, a young Jersey had stepped into the cubby beside the\r\nBlack Calf, and they were having a pleasant visit. "What are those\r\nfellows fighting about?" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe Black Calf smiled a funny little smile. "They are fighting," said\r\nshe, "to see which one shall stand in the cubby with me and chew his\r\ncud."\r\n\r\nThe Jersey Calf was a shrewd young fellow of very good family.\r\n"Perhaps," said he, "I ought to stay and guard the place until it is\r\ndecided who shall have it."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would," said she.\r\n\r\nAnd that was how it happened that the two Calves who lost their tempers\r\nhad a cross, tiresome, and uncomfortable day, while another had the very\r\ncorner which they wanted. When night came, they grumbled because the\r\nJersey Calf had come out ahead of them, and they thought it very\r\nstrange. But it was not strange, for the people who are quiet and\r\ngood-natured always come out ahead in the end. And the people who are so\r\nvery sure that it is easy to be good when they really want to, are just\r\nthe very ones who sometimes do not want to when they should.\r\n\r\nThe Black Calf was right. The only way to be sensible and happy is to\r\ntry and try and try, and it does pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Forest People.\r\n\r\nBy CLARA D.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
