The first blind man put\r\nout his hand and touched the elephant\'s broad side. The second took hold\r\nof a leg. The third grasped a tusk, and the fourth clutched the animal\'s\r\ntail.\r\n\r\n"Now do you know what an elephant looks like?" asked a friend.\r\n\r\n"Yes," cried the first. "The elephant is broad and flat like a barn\r\ndoor."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed the second. "The elephant is big and round like the\r\ntrunk of a tree."\r\n\r\n"Not so!" cried the third. "The elephant is hard and smooth like a\r\npolished stone."\r\n\r\n"What are you all talking about?" cried the fourth. "The elephant is\r\njust like a piece of rope."\r\n\r\nMuch so-called teaching of geography leads to just such incomplete and\r\nfantastic ideas about geographical concepts. Very many children have\r\nonly vague, incomplete and incorrect conceptions of the things they see.\r\nLike these physically and mentally blind men we are too often satisfied\r\nwith mere wordy descriptions of subjects when we might study the subject\r\nat first hand if we would.\r\n\r\nThis little book is intended to prevent the giving of information by\r\ndescription, but to suggest ways of directing attention to those things\r\nwhich lie within reach of the child\'s senses, things which he might pass\r\nby, things which are needed now to stimulate an intelligent interest in\r\nhis surroundings, things which are needed later for an appreciation and\r\nenjoyment of his study of the larger facts and concepts of geography. If\r\nthe larger geographical concepts are to have accuracy and richness for\r\nthe child he must have his attention directed to his surroundings. The\r\ntrite expression "from the known to the unknown" is good pedagogy, but\r\nthere must be a "known" on which to build.\r\n\r\nThe book is based upon the author\'s actual experience in the class-room\r\nstudying the children at their geography tasks. It has been her\r\nexperience that the efforts of the teachers to build broad geographical\r\nconcepts were of no avail because the pupils did not have accurate\r\nintimate knowledge of the necessary home geography upon which to build.\r\nTo correct this defect she set about collecting and classifying the\r\nnecessary material. With the use of this material she not only found\r\nthat the class teachers had much less difficulty in presenting the study\r\nof the earth as a whole, but that an interest beyond all expectation was\r\napparent in the children.\r\n\r\nThe following pages are valuable more on account of the things they\r\nsuggest than for any geographical facts which they incidentally present.\r\nThe book is not a text-book on geography; it is a compendium of\r\nsuggestion on the study of the subject. It makes little effort to\r\npresent facts, but rather it tells how to gather, classify and study\r\nfacts. It is intended to be used with children during the age when they\r\nespecially delight in the making of collections, and is intended to turn\r\nto a definite use this childish instinct.\r\n\r\nMap study is based entirely upon the child\'s experiences as he makes\r\nplans of his schoolroom, schoolhouse, streets and city. The suggestions\r\nregarding the study of things foreign to the child are based entirely\r\nupon his experience in the study of the types with which he has become\r\nfamiliar in his study of his surroundings.\r\n\r\n  Milton C. Cooper,\r\n  Superintendent of District Nine, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nGeographical knowledge should progress from the known to the unknown,\r\nfrom the familiar to the unfamiliar. The world is the home of mankind.\r\nWe can best understand the larger world by a preliminary consideration\r\nof our own small intimate home. We therefore begin to study geography\r\nwith an account of the child\'s immediate environment. The school stands\r\nfor the common home of the class. From the school we gradually widen out\r\nour teaching to include the immediate neighborhood with its buildings,\r\nand finally the whole town or community.\r\n\r\nWe study the various types of people whom we meet every day, and the\r\nindustries in which they engage in their efforts to obtain the three\r\nmain necessities of human life,--food, clothing and shelter. The animals\r\nand plants sharing the world with man and contributing to his sustenance\r\nnext focus our attention.\r\n\r\nThe home neighborhood has its physiographical features distinguishing it\r\nfrom other places and influencing the life of its inhabitants. The land\r\nand water divisions in the immediate environment are studied as types,\r\nwhile those not closely related to our home are reserved for\r\nconsideration as each one occurs in its local geographical place in the\r\ncourse of study.\r\n\r\nWe must know something of direction in order to conveniently locate the\r\nstreets, buildings and physiographical features near our home. Finally,\r\nwe will try to realize the great size of the earth, of which our home is\r\nbut a small portion, by a consideration of the relationship of our\r\ncommunity to the rest of the world and to some of this world\'s great\r\ndiversities.\r\n\r\nAs geography is a study of cause and effect, the early lessons should be\r\nmainly oral. Later, in order to obtain a broad knowledge of geographical\r\ndata, not one but many books should be read. This little book aims to\r\nserve as a bridge between the oral lesson and the descriptive text-book.\r\nThe presentation of many questions leads the pupil to think out cause\r\nand effect, and to connect his present knowledge with the realm of the\r\nunknown. Special care has been exercised to present facts only when\r\nfacts are absolutely necessary, and only after allowing the pupil the\r\nopportunity to first exercise his own reasoning faculties in obtaining\r\nthe information.\r\n\r\nThe excursion is an essential part of every geography course, and every\r\neffort should be made to use this effective means of teaching.\r\n\r\nFour types of valuable exercises may be suggested in the use of this\r\nbook:\r\n\r\n1. The pupils may read the questions orally and give the answers orally.\r\n\r\n2. They may read the questions silently, answering them orally.\r\n\r\n3. They may read the questions orally and write the answers.\r\n\r\n4. Finally, they may silently read the questions and write the answers.\r\n\r\nAll definitions have been carefully avoided as tending to hamper the\r\nfree acquisition of ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I\r\n\r\n  TOPICS\r\n\r\n   1.

Tell what you\r\ncan remember of the different parts of the building which can be seen\r\nfrom the street or road. Describe each of these parts:\r\n\r\n  Walls      Roof\r\n  Windows    Chimneys\r\n  Doors      Fire-escape\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nAs you look at the school from the outside what materials do you see\r\nthat the builders have used? Where have they needed stone, slate, glass,\r\ntin, iron, steel, wood?\r\n\r\nNow let us think of the garden and playground. Tell about the different\r\nparts and the materials that have been used in making them.\r\n\r\nWhat great numbers of workmen were needed before a school like ours\r\ncould be built! Who procured the stone and the slate? Whose work was\r\nneeded to obtain the iron, the steel and the tin? Who made the glass?\r\nWhich workmen shall we thank for the wood?\r\n\r\nCan you think how the bare lot looked before the school was built? Many\r\nmen with shovels and pick-axes dug out the foundation, and numbers of\r\nhorses and wagons were needed to carry out the earth. Then came the\r\nbuilders. How were so many materials brought here?\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n1. We will go outdoors together and look at the school building.\r\n\r\n2. We will stand north of the school, south, east and west of it. Notice\r\nthe position of the parts, their number, shape, size and color.\r\n\r\n3. As we stand at each side, see whether there are any parts which you\r\nnever noticed before or any parts which we forgot to mention yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLook at this drawing of a school building and grounds. It is called a\r\nplan. Before any school or church or home is built a plan must be drawn.\r\nThis is to show the workmen what to do. See how much of the ground is\r\nused for the building. Find the garden. What are in the garden? Which is\r\nlarger, the garden or the playground? What shape is the playground? How\r\nmany doors are there to the building? In how many ways can you get into\r\nthe playground?\r\n\r\nTry to draw a plan of your school building and yard, showing the gates,\r\nthe flagpole, the drinking fountain or pump, and any other parts you\r\nthink of. Show which door you use most.\r\n\r\n    _Note to the Teacher._--The pupils should draw the plan upon paper\r\n    while the teacher draws it upon the blackboard. Infinite care should\r\n    be exercised to invest every line with its full meaning. Upon the\r\n    proper interpretation of this first plan will depend much of the\r\n    pupil\'s future ability to correctly read a map as the representation\r\n    of a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nTHE INSIDE OF THE SCHOOL\r\n\r\nAs you walk from the school door to your room what do you see? Tell all\r\nthat you have noticed in the corridors, on the staircases, in the\r\ncloak-rooms and the class-rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nWe will go on a little excursion through the school today, walking along\r\nall of the corridors and upon all of the staircases. Look especially to\r\nsee anything that you never saw before, and notice anything that you\r\nforgot to mention in yesterday\'s description.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nAnswer the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. How many stories high is our school?\r\n\r\n2. How many class-rooms are on each floor?\r\n\r\n3. How many other rooms are on each floor?\r\n\r\n4. How many staircases does our school have?\r\n\r\n5. What materials have been used in building the staircases?\r\n\r\n6. What can be seen in the corridor nearest your room?\r\n\r\n7. By how many doorways can the children leave the building?\r\n\r\n8. How is your school heated and ventilated?\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nDescribe everything that you can see in your class-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF SCHOOL ROOM]\r\n\r\nLook at this plan of a school-room. See if you can draw a plan of _your_\r\nschool-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nMake a list of all the materials that have been used in building the\r\ninside of your school. Remember all of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  Floors      Windows       Corridor furnishings\r\n  Ceilings    Doors         Class-room furnishings\r\n  Walls       Staircases\r\n\r\nNow write a list of the kinds of workmen who gathered together these\r\nmaterials. Name as many of the kinds of workmen as you can think of who\r\nwere engaged on the inside work of the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nWrite a letter to anyone whom you know who has never seen our school.\r\nTell all about our building and the good workmen by whom it was planned\r\nand built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE STREETS AND ROADS\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nOn what street or road does your school stand?\r\n\r\nOn what street or road do you live?\r\n\r\nWhat streets or roads do you pass on your way home?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think is the finest street or road that you have ever seen\r\nanywhere? What makes that so good a street or road?\r\n\r\nName a poor street or road. What could be done to improve it?\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nWhy do cities and towns have streets and roads? Where are there no\r\nstreets?\r\n\r\nLook at the country picture shown on page 19. How pretty it is! When\r\nwould it be pleasant to walk there? When would it not be so pleasant?\r\nWhy? What must be done to a road to make it into a good street? Tell\r\nwhat you can of the different ways of paving, lighting and draining\r\nstreets and roads, and of the different kinds of name-signs you have\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nNow what can be done to make a street or road beautiful and pleasant in\r\nwarm weather?\r\n\r\nHow can boys and girls help to keep the streets and roads pleasant?\r\n\r\nHere is a plan of some of the streets in a large city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF CITY STREETS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nDraw the shape of the school lot. Now show the street or road that the\r\nschool stands upon. If you live in a town, draw the streets next to the\r\nschool. Then draw the next streets, and keep on until you have drawn the\r\nstreet on which your home stands. Place a little cross to show your\r\nhome. With your pencil start from your house and make a dotted line to\r\nshow how you come to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nOn your plan of the neighborhood place a circle to show the grocery\r\nstore or bakery that you pass on your way to school. Make a large dot to\r\nshow the nearest store to school, and with a dotted line explain how you\r\nwould go there from school if your teacher sent you to buy ink. Make a\r\ncircle with a cross in it to show where there is a church, a bank, a\r\nfactory, or any other important building near your school. If there is a\r\nrailroad near, show it upon your plan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COUNTRY HOME.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nMany streets and lanes have names of trees. Some have been named after\r\ngreat and good men. There are some streets with only numbers for names.\r\nDo you know of any streets having names of these different kinds? Can\r\nyou think of any street or road that received its name for some other\r\nreason?\r\n\r\nGet as many pictures as you can of the streets of your town or any other\r\ntown and paste them in your note-book. Get some pictures of country\r\nroads and paste them also in your note-book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CITY STREET.\r\n  (Copyright, 1911, William H. Rau, Philadelphia.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nIn some towns the streets are nearly straight and cross each other like\r\nthe wires of a window-screen. In other towns the streets run off from\r\nthe centre of the town like the spokes of a wheel. Some streets and\r\nroads are very crooked.\r\n\r\nHow are the streets in our town arranged? Name some of our best business\r\nstreets. Which streets have the finest homes in which people live? Name\r\nsome streets or roads with trolley lines upon them. Are our streets\r\npaved?\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nPerhaps you live in the country where there are very few streets or none\r\nat all. How different is your walk to school each day from that of the\r\ncity boy or girl! In town, children walk on paved streets and pass many\r\nbuildings. What kind of roads do the country children walk upon? What\r\nbuildings do they pass? A country school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MODERN COUNTRY SCHOOL.]\r\n\r\nDo you take a pleasant road between broad fields? Do you walk through\r\nthe cool shady woods? Perhaps you run over a bridge with the clear brook\r\nsparkling and babbling beneath. What else do you see or hear in the\r\ncountry which city folks do not know in their built up towns?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE BUILDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nWhat kinds of buildings do you pass on your way to school? Write a list\r\nof all the kinds that you have ever seen.\r\n\r\nLook at the pictures of buildings in this book and see if you know for\r\nwhat each is used. How can you tell?\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nOf all the many kinds of buildings in town or country, the _houses_ are\r\nthe most important. It is more necessary to have good homes to live in\r\nthan to have the other buildings large or beautiful. What makes a good\r\nresidence? There must be enough room for the whole family. It needs\r\nplenty of light, air, sunshine and water. It must have a good roof to\r\nkeep it dry in stormy weather. It should be well heated in the cold\r\nwinter. Tell of other things that are needed in our homes to keep the\r\nfamily healthy and happy. How can you help to make your home pleasant?\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nGood _schools_, too, are very necessary. The school-house must be built\r\nto keep the boys and girls comfortable and healthy while at work. Name\r\nsome of the things needed for a good school building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET SCENE IN NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe libraries and museums also teach people. A _library_ is like a home\r\nwhere many friendly teachers live. These friends will talk to you and\r\ntell you many useful and wonderful things. Have you ever visited them at\r\nthe library? Have you ever taken any of them home with you? Is there a\r\nlibrary near our school?\r\n\r\nThe _museums_ are full of many interesting objects. You may see\r\nbeautiful pictures and statuary. Some have collections of pretty stones\r\nand of stuffed animals. Curious clothing, jewelry, toys and musical\r\ninstruments used by people in distant lands are shown too. In a museum\r\nin Portland you may see the dear little clothing worn by the poet\r\nLongfellow when he was a tiny baby. Many books that Washington read are\r\nkept in a museum near the city of Washington. Have you ever visited a\r\nmuseum in a city? What did you see there?\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nNo buildings anywhere are more beautiful than the _churches_. Are there\r\nany churches in your neighborhood? Describe the church which you attend.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nIn town and country there are many ill people who cannot be cared for at\r\nhome. They go to _hospitals_ to be nursed back to health and strength.\r\nThe good doctors and nurses work day and night to cure the sick people.\r\nHow can well people help sick people? Where is the nearest hospital to\r\nyour home? What is it named?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDEPENDENCE HALL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nAlmost every town has a _Town Hall_. Have you ever seen such a building?\r\nWhat is it used for? Here the mayor has his office. Sometimes the Town\r\nHall or Court House has a high tower, or a fine dome, or a cupola. If\r\nyou have ever seen a Town Hall tell how it looked.\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nThink of the _stores_ that you have seen. How many kinds can you name?\r\nWhat does each sell principally? Where are these things made? Have you\r\never seen a large _factory_? What does it manufacture?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PITTSBURGH OBSERVATORY.]\r\n\r\nIt would be fine if all of the buildings in which folks work were sunny,\r\nairy and clean. People employed in comfortable stores and factories are\r\nhappy and feel like working.\r\n\r\nAlas! there are many miserable places where the workmen are crowded and\r\nuncomfortable. The impure air makes them tired and ill. If you have seen\r\na good store or factory tell what helps to keep the workers comfortable\r\nand healthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nOld cities have in them many very old buildings that all Americans love.\r\nThe magnificent Capitol at Washington was built long ago. It is one of\r\nthe finest buildings in the world. It is built of white marble. In the\r\nfirst picture in this book notice the beautiful dome and the great high\r\nstairs. In Philadelphia is the dear old Independence Hall with the\r\nLiberty Bell. Boston has the old Faneuil Hall. Here many great Americans\r\nof long ago have spoken to the people. Are there any old historic\r\nbuildings in our neighborhood?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONGFELLOW\'S BIRTHPLACE, PORTLAND, MAINE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nSuppose some friends travel on the railroad to visit us. At what\r\nrailroad station would the train arrive? Are there any other stations?\r\nHow are they built? Do you think they give a beautiful, clean, friendly\r\nwelcome to strangers? All stations should be pleasant and comfortable to\r\ncheer the tired travelers that pass through them day and night. At\r\nDenver, just outside of the station, there is a great arch stretching\r\nacross the street. It says, "Welcome," in bright letters at night and in\r\npretty letters in the day. The visitor is glad to see the friendly word\r\nafter a long trip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD SOUTH CHURCH, BOSTON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nWhen friends come from another town we like to show them the sights.\r\nPlan a nice trip around the town. Write a list of places to which you\r\nwould take them. You must know where each place is. What could you tell\r\nabout each place?\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nOne day we should visit some park. Is there any near our school? Are\r\nthere any interesting buildings or statuary in the park? Is there any\r\nwater near by?\r\n\r\nWhen we visit our town park we should remember that it belongs to us,\r\nfor a public park belongs to all of the people. Do you not like to have\r\nthe things that belong to you as good, as useful and as beautiful as\r\npossible? Do you want your home to look sweet and clean and comfortable,\r\nor dirty, careless and unpleasant? Do you want your clothing to be\r\nstrong, neat and pretty, or torn and dirty? We should all take pride in\r\nhaving the things we own just as good as possible. When you are in the\r\nstreet, the school, any public building, or in a park, say to yourself,\r\n"This is mine." Then look around and see whether you like the way it\r\nlooks. Think how you can help to keep it looking well or make it look\r\neven better.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINTER SCENE IN FAIRMOUNT PARK.]\r\n\r\nHow can boys and girls help keep the grass, the paths, the flower-beds,\r\nthe trees and the buildings beautiful? Where does the money come from to\r\npay the caretakers of the park?\r\n\r\nSome people visit the park only in spring, summer or autumn. We all love\r\nthe park in those seasons. Many do not know how beautiful the bare trees\r\nlook in winter with their gray or brown branches. There is no more\r\nexquisite sight in the world than to see these trees coated with\r\nglistening ice out to the tiniest twig, or to see them ridged with\r\npearly white snow. It is a merry sight to see the jolly coasters and\r\nskaters.\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nCopy the list of buildings given below and mark each kind that you have\r\nseen. Tell where you saw it, of what it was built, or for what it was\r\nused.\r\n\r\n  Residence    School                 Museum\r\n  Store        Church                 Car-barn\r\n  Bank         Hospital               Library\r\n  Factory      Railroad station       Office\r\n  Stable       Government building    Garage\r\n  Dairy        Barn                   Ice House\r\n\r\nWhat building is shown on the cover of this book?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN AS A WHOLE\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThink of the times when you have walked or ridden about our town.\r\n\r\nWhat rivers did you see?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPITOL AT HARRISBURG.]\r\n\r\nWhich buildings did you think were very beautiful?\r\n\r\nWhat was each used for?\r\n\r\nWhat buildings have we that are very helpful to the people?\r\n\r\nWhat interesting places have you visited in your neighborhood?\r\n\r\nWhat other places would you like to visit?\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR A TRIP TO SOME HILLTOP, OBSERVATORY, TOWER OR\r\nROOF-GARDEN FROM WHICH AN EXTENSIVE VIEW CAN BE HAD\r\n\r\nWhat place shall we visit? Why? Draw a plan to include the school and\r\nthe place to be visited.\r\n\r\nHow far must we go? Shall we ride or walk? In what direction shall we\r\ngo?\r\n\r\nWhen we are up high we can look over the whole neighborhood. First, try\r\nto find our school. In what direction shall we need to face? Then let us\r\nnotice what lies between us and our school. See if you can find any park\r\nor large building which you know. Try to find the street or road upon\r\nwhich your home stands. Then look beyond our school for any other\r\nfamiliar building or park, and look for your home if you did not see it\r\nbefore. Notice how far the town stretches and try to see what cuts it\r\noff or bounds it.\r\n\r\nNext we shall turn and look in the opposite direction. What direction\r\nwill that be? Find any familiar places. How can you know which are\r\nhomes, schools, churches or factories? See how far the town extends and\r\nwhat cuts off or bounds it on this side.\r\n\r\nIn what other directions shall we look? Again we shall notice the\r\nfamiliar and unfamiliar places and the town boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nTHE TRIP\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nWas the neighborhood view like you expected? What surprised you? What\r\ndid we see most of? Make a list of all the places you remember seeing.\r\nThink of each view separately; north, south, east and west. Tell of\r\nanything you saw as you looked in each direction. Why could we see so\r\nmuch? How could we see even farther?\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nDo we live in a large city, a small town or in the country? What is the\r\nname of our town or the nearest town? Who first settled in the place\r\nwhich has grown to be a town? It is hard for us to believe that two\r\nhundred and fifty years ago there were no houses, churches, schools,\r\nstreets or roads where we now live. All this land was wild country,\r\nmostly woods. The early settlers were strong and brave men. They had to\r\ncut down the forests and build their first homes of rough logs. Then\r\nthey planted fields with corn, wheat and vegetables. They killed the\r\nwild animals for food, using the skins for clothing. As soon as\r\npossible the settlers tried to build a small plain church and a\r\nschool-house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS. From a "Thistle" Print.\r\n  (Copyright, Detroit Publishing Co.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLUMBUS\'S SHIP.]\r\n\r\nNow we have our fine towns which have grown from the early work of these\r\nfirst sturdy settlers. All of the people should love our dear home town\r\nand try to make it beautiful, healthful and comfortable. We should love\r\nour neighbors and treat them all like brothers and sisters. If we are\r\ntrue to our village or our dear town we will be kind and fair to all,\r\nrich and poor, Americans and foreigners, white and colored people. That\r\nis one way of showing our thankfulness for our comfortable homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThink of the many buildings which you see as you look over the\r\nlandscape. There are people living in nearly all of those houses. Just\r\nthink of the many, many people who live here. How many are there? How\r\nmany schools have we in the town? How many people go to your school?\r\n\r\nMost of these people look much alike, but some are very different in\r\nappearance. Name some of the different kinds of people whom you have\r\nseen. How do you distinguish a negro and Chinaman or Mongolian from a\r\nwhite person or Caucasian? Tell about their hair, skin or any other\r\npeculiar features.\r\n\r\nEach kind of people is called a race. The pictures show some of the\r\nraces we often see--Caucasian, Mongolian and negro. The Chinese and\r\nJapanese are called Mongolians.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nTHE INDIANS\r\n\r\nThe Indians lived at this place which is now our home long before there\r\nwere any white people here or any towns at all. Where these many\r\nbuildings now stand there was wild country, fields and woods. Under the\r\ntrees stood the Indian wigwams made of skins and branches. The early\r\nsettlers came to this country from far across the ocean. After William\r\nPenn landed with his companions he began at once to make friends with\r\nthe Indians. As the red men were living upon the land, Penn thought that\r\nit was only fair and honest to buy from them the land that the English\r\npeople wanted for their homes. The Indians could not use money, so he\r\ngave them blankets and other presents which pleased them very much. The\r\nIndians promised William Penn to live in peace with the white men and\r\nthey kept their promise for many years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INDIAN FAMILY.]\r\n\r\nMost of the white people who came in those early days to other parts of\r\nour land did not act in this noble way. When they wanted land on which\r\nto build their homes they drove the Indians away, killing many of them.\r\nThus these unjustly treated Indians became the enemies of the white men,\r\nand often treated them very cruelly in return. Let us remember that the\r\nIndians were the first owners of this land of ours and that they should\r\nbe treated as William Penn showed us, with kindness and justice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN CHIEF.]\r\n\r\nThose wild Indians of long ago had many noble traits. They were strong\r\nand brave and fearless.\r\n\r\n    Read in some of your school books about Indians and their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nTHE NEGROES\r\n\r\nThere were no negroes in this country till many years after Columbus and\r\nthe other white men began to settle here. Some white men went far across\r\nthe sea to Africa. They stole the negroes away from their homes, carried\r\nthem to their ships and sailed back to this country. Then these white\r\nmen sold the negroes to other men for money. The poor colored men had to\r\nwork terribly hard as slaves and received no pay for their work. At last\r\nthey were freed by Abraham Lincoln and others who helped him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEGRO.]\r\n\r\nThe negroes have much that is fine in their character. Even when they\r\nwere slaves they often grew to love their masters so dearly that they\r\nwould do anything in the world, even give up their lives, for their\r\nmasters. We should always remember that God made the negro as well as\r\nthe white man. Fair-minded people will try to be honest, kind and just\r\nto everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE MANDARIN AND SERVANT.]\r\n\r\nMany Chinamen have come to our country from their distant homes in\r\nChina. Their country is so crowded, and it is so hard to earn a living\r\nthere, that most of the people are very poor.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese living in our country are peaceful and quiet. They work very\r\nhard in their laundries and other places of business; yet there are many\r\nwhite people so cruel and thoughtless as to ridicule a Chinaman whenever\r\nthey see one. These white people should remember that God made the\r\nChinaman and that he is a stranger here in our country. Is it not even\r\nworse to ill-treat a stranger than one who is at home? The color of our\r\nskin and hair is not very important. It matters far more whether we are\r\nhonest, loving, industrious and fair-minded.\r\n\r\nNot all of the white people living around us were born in this country.\r\nWhere did your parents and grandparents live when they were children?\r\nDo you know any people who came from distant lands? Where were their\r\nfirst homes? Find out how many of the parents of your schoolmates came a\r\nlong journey over the water to reach our land.\r\n\r\nYes, we have people from many foreign countries. Some are English,\r\nIrish, Scotch or French. Then there are the Germans, Italians, Russians\r\nand others. From what country did each of these people come?\r\n\r\nHere they are all living together, people from all over the great wide\r\nworld. Our homes stand side by side. We work and play together. Truly we\r\nare brothers and sisters, for we are all children in the great human\r\nfamily. It matters not from what distant land our people may have come,\r\nwe should all be bound together like one family by human love and\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIES AND OCCUPATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nWhich members of your family work? Why do they work? For what is the\r\nmoney they earn spent? Think which of these things are absolutely\r\nnecessary to keep us alive.\r\n\r\nWe all need _food_.\r\n\r\nWe all need _clothing_.\r\n\r\nWe all need _homes or shelter_.\r\n\r\nWithout these provisions we should die.\r\n\r\nHow do we get our food, our clothing and our homes? How did people get\r\nthem when there were no stores and no money? Do you know of any people\r\nwho were compelled to get things in this way?\r\n\r\n    In a school reader, read about how primitive people lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL\r\n\r\nWe have two kinds of food, vegetable food, which grows from the ground,\r\nand animal food. Name some foods of each kind. All plants grow out of\r\nthe earth or soil. The soil is necessary to produce our animal food\r\nalso. The meat we eat comes from sheep, cows, chickens and other\r\nanimals. These animals all live on vegetable food. Without good soil\r\nthere would be no grass nor hay. No grass would mean no food for cows\r\nand sheep. So we see that all of our food really comes from the soil.\r\n\r\nOur clothing, too, is dependent upon the soil. The cotton plant grows up\r\nout of the ground. The wool comes from the sheep, which eats grass which\r\ngrows from the ground.\r\n\r\nEven our homes could not be built without products from the earth or\r\nsoil. Think how much wood is used in the construction of a house. The\r\ntrees which grow in the soil give us all the wood. Much iron, steel,\r\ncopper, brass and nickel are used in our homes. Stones and bricks form\r\npart of many houses. All of these things come out of the earth. What a\r\nwonderful thing is the soil! Out of it come our food, our clothing and\r\nour shelter!\r\n\r\n    In one of your books read the wonderful story of how we obtain a\r\n    loaf of bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nWrite a list of all the kinds of work you can think of which people do.\r\n\r\nCopy this list of industries and place a cross beside the ones at which\r\nany persons you know work:\r\n\r\n  Mining                 Printing and bookmaking\r\n  Weaving                Iron and steel work\r\n  Shipbuilding           Glass-blowing\r\n  Lumbering              Pottery making\r\n  Brickmaking            Meat packing\r\n  Farming                Dairying\r\n  Manufacturing foods    Manufacturing clothing\r\n  Ice cutting            Manufacturing furniture\r\n\r\nWhich are town industries? Which are country industries?\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nWould you like to go to-morrow to visit a factory in which some food or\r\nclothing is manufactured? Look at the map of the town. Find your school.\r\nFind the factory. How far must we go and in what direction? What is the\r\nname of the place we will visit? Notice all of the things made there.\r\nTry to remember all of the materials needed at the factory, and find out\r\nwhere these materials come from. Try to remember just how the articles\r\nare made. Find out what will be done with the things that are\r\nmanufactured. Notice the number and kinds of machines used. See how many\r\nworkmen are employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nAFTER THE TRIP\r\n\r\nWrite a letter to a friend in another class telling all about your\r\nvisit. Mention these points:\r\n\r\n1. Where you went.\r\n\r\n2. What was made.\r\n\r\n3. How it was made.\r\n\r\n4. The materials used.\r\n\r\n5. The machinery.\r\n\r\n6. The workmen.\r\n\r\n7. The usefulness of the factory.\r\n\r\n8. The care and skill of the workmen.\r\n\r\n9. Anything else interesting about the trip.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nEvery town and every village is a workshop. There are many workmen here\r\nthat do good, careful work. Some of the goods of our town may be sent\r\nthousands of miles away to other people who need them. The country\r\npeople, too, do much useful work. Name some of the things which our\r\nworkmen do for other people living at a distance from us.\r\n\r\n    Read about the manufacture of the articles which you saw being made\r\n    at the factory.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nThere are many workers in the world who do not make things with their\r\nhands. Most of their work is done with their minds, though, of course,\r\ntheir hands help too. Name some of these. What kind of work does each of\r\nthe following do?\r\n\r\n  Teacher    Lawyer    Minister\r\n  Doctor     Author    Banker\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nANIMALS AND PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThere are many other living creatures in the world besides people. Write\r\na list of all the kinds of animals that you have ever seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN BUFFALO.]\r\n\r\nSome of these animals live near the homes of men. They are tame. Men\r\ntake care of them and see that they get food. Many of these animals are\r\nvery useful to us. Write a list of these tame animals. At the top of the\r\nlist write _Domestic Animals_. Of what use is each of the following\r\nanimals when alive? Which are useful after they are killed? Of what use\r\nto man is each one?\r\n\r\n  Horse    Pig    Chicken\r\n  Cow      Dog    Duck\r\n  Sheep    Cat    Pigeon.\r\n\r\n    Read about how our meat is supplied to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nWrite a list of all the _wild animals_ you remember ever having seen.\r\nWhere did you see them? How were they prevented from harming people?\r\nWhere was the natural home of these animals? How did they get their\r\nfood? How do they now get their food?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RACCOON.]\r\n\r\nSome of these animals so closely resemble the domestic animals that they\r\nare said to belong to the same family. Read the names of the animals\r\nbelonging to the same family and tell in what way they resemble each\r\nother. Tell which are domestic and which are wild.\r\n\r\nTHE CAT FAMILY\r\n\r\n  Cat    Lion    Tiger    Leopard\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIGER.]\r\n\r\nTHE DOG FAMILY\r\n\r\n  Dog    Fox    Wolf\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE FAMILY\r\n\r\n  Horse    Zebra\r\n\r\nTHE COW FAMILY\r\n\r\n  Cow    Buffalo\r\n\r\nDescribe some of these wild animals:\r\n\r\n  Elephant    Fox\r\n  Squirrel    Wolf\r\n  Bear        Deer\r\n\r\nThere are also many fish, birds and insects.\r\n\r\nPaste in your notebook any pictures of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nTake a trip to the Zoological Gardens and see these animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEOPARD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nWhich domestic or wild animals are useful to us in obtaining food,\r\nclothing and shelter?\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nPLANTS\r\n\r\nWe cannot live without food, clothing and shelter. Let us see how plants\r\nhelp us to obtain these three great necessities.\r\n\r\nWrite a list of all the plants that you can name.\r\n\r\nDraw a line under each that is useful for _food_.\r\n\r\nDraw two lines under each that is useful for _clothing_.\r\n\r\nDraw three lines under each that is useful in making or furnishing our\r\n_homes or shelter_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELK.]\r\n\r\nOf what use are the plants that are not underlined? Are they beautiful?\r\nHow dull the world would be without flowers!\r\n\r\nWe have:\r\n\r\n1. Food plants.\r\n\r\n2. Clothing plants.\r\n\r\n3. Shelter plants.\r\n\r\n4. Ornamental plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThink of the foods that you had on your dinner table yesterday. Where\r\ndid each come from? How did it get here? Was there anything which came\r\nfrom our own neighborhood, and which did not have to take a long journey\r\neither to the factory where it was manufactured or to the store where it\r\nwas sold?\r\n\r\nExamine the clothing you are wearing. Of what material is each article\r\nmade? Where did the materials come from? Where were they manufactured?\r\nWhich had to come a long journey before it reached your home?\r\n\r\nLook around the school-room and name the materials which had to travel a\r\nlong distance before we could have them for our use.\r\n\r\nImagine trying to get our food, our clothing and our shelter materials\r\nright near our school. How much could we be sure of having?\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have seen products being brought into the city. You may have\r\nseen the milk trains unloading their many shining cans. Surely you have\r\nseen the freight cars with their signs painted on the outside telling\r\nthat they are refrigerator cars, or coal cars, or other kinds of cars.\r\nWhat do they carry?\r\n\r\nMost of the things we need are brought here on trains. Where is there in\r\nour neighborhood a freight railroad station? Is it near our school?\r\n\r\nSome products are taken from the country to the town in wagons. You have\r\nseen the big hay wagons which go a long way from some farm to take food\r\nfor the city horses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE TRANSPORTATION.]\r\n\r\nHow else are products carried? Coffee, rubber, pepper, chocolate and\r\nmuch silk are brought here from distant lands in ships. If you go to the\r\nharbor of a large city you can see hundreds of busy men unloading the\r\nbig steamers.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nShips and railroads carry not only foods but people too. There are many\r\nways of carrying people and products. These are some of the ways:\r\n\r\n1. On the backs of animals, as horses, camels, elephants.\r\n\r\n2. In wheelbarrows.\r\n\r\n3. In wagons.\r\n\r\n4. In automobiles.\r\n\r\n5. In trolley cars.\r\n\r\n6. In railroad trains.\r\n\r\n7. On boats, or ships.\r\n\r\n8. In sleighs.\r\n\r\n9. On bicycles.\r\n\r\n10. In airships.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRANSPORTATION IN ARABIA.]\r\n\r\nIn which of these ways have you traveled? Can you tell what power is\r\nused in each case?\r\n\r\nIn order to travel safely and quickly we need more than something in\r\nwhich to carry the people and products. We must have good wagon roads,\r\nwell built railroads, tunnels through the mountains, and bridges over\r\nthe rivers. Lighthouses are necessary to warn the vessels of the rocks\r\nat night or in the storms.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nWhen people need things from a distance they cannot always go all the\r\nway to the place and bring back the products or articles. It is quicker\r\nand easier to send messages asking for what is needed. How would your\r\nmother send an order to the butcher for meat if she did not wish to go\r\nfor it? How could a farmer send a message to the city ordering new milk\r\ncans and strawberry boxes? How do messages come to your house?\r\n\r\nIn olden days the persons had to carry all of their messages for\r\nthemselves or send them by other persons. The messenger would often run\r\nfor miles without resting so as to deliver the letters as soon as\r\npossible. At last the people decided to give all of their letters to a\r\npostman who would ride on horseback from place to place with the mail.\r\nStagecoaches were next used. It took a week for a coach to go as far as\r\na train can go now in a few hours. Our mail is now carried from one\r\nplace to another by trains or vessels, and then the letter carriers\r\ndeliver it at our city houses or to our town post office or rural\r\nmail-box.\r\n\r\nThe quickest way to send a message is by cable, telegraph, telephone or\r\nwireless message. Over the electric wires or through the air the words\r\nare flashed for miles in a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFAMILIAR SURFACE FEATURES\r\n\r\n  1. Hill and plain.         3. River\r\n  2. Mountain and valley.    4. Ocean\r\n      5. Island and peninsula.\r\n\r\n    _Note to the Teacher._--Consider at this time only such familiar\r\n    features as belong to the children\'s immediate environment in or\r\n    very near their neighborhood. Defer the study of the other land and\r\n    water forms until later, as suggested in the Introduction. For\r\n    further details of these features, see Chapters I and IV in Part II.\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nHILL AND PLAIN\r\n\r\nSome streets and roads are flat and level. Others slope like _hills_.\r\nCan you name a street which is level, and one that slants or slopes?\r\nWhich road is easier to walk on? Why? Do you prefer the level or the\r\nsloping street when roller-skating? Why? Which is the best when you are\r\ncoasting?\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed that some of the fields in the park or in the\r\ncountry are nearly flat. Other fields lie on slopes or hills. We call\r\nthe flat part of the land a _plain_, whether it is in the city or in the\r\ncountry. The sloping part of the land forms a hill. Have we mostly hills\r\nor plains in the streets of our city?\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nSome plains and some hills are covered with trees. If you were in the\r\nwoods, surrounded by trees, how would you know whether you were on a\r\nplain or on a hill?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HILLS AND VALLEYS.]\r\n\r\nSome hills look very different from others. Some slope very gradually,\r\nwhile some are very steep. Some hills have city streets on them. Others\r\nhave great fields of grass for cows to graze upon. Still others are\r\nplanted with corn, wheat, rye or vegetables. There are wooded hills\r\ncovered with trees. How do we know that all of these very different\r\nforms are hills?\r\n\r\nIn the same way plains vary greatly. While some have been made into city\r\nstreets, others are large, flat, grassy fields, with streams sometimes\r\nflowing through them. Some plains are covered with forests. Others are\r\nplanted with grain and vegetables. How can you know when you see a plain\r\nif there are so many different kinds?\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nLook through the pictures in this book and decide which show hills and\r\nwhich show plains. Which is easier for a farmer to plow, a hill or a\r\nplain? Why?\r\n\r\nIf you were sent upon an errand, would you choose to go by way of a\r\nhilly road or by a level one? Which is the pleasantest place for a\r\nsummer home, upon a hill or upon a plain?\r\n\r\nHow must a driver help his horses when they are pulling a heavy load up\r\nor down a hill?\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS\r\n\r\nSome hills are so very, very high that they have been called\r\n_mountains_. What are our neighboring mountains named? Have you ever\r\nbeen to the top of one of these mountains? Describe the beautiful view\r\nfrom the summit. Did you see any wild creatures along the way? Tell\r\nabout any trees and other plants that you noticed.\r\n\r\nWhen people build homes in mountain regions they generally place them in\r\nthe low land between the high mountains. Why? This lower land is called\r\na _valley_. The people in the valley town can often look beyond the\r\nfields and see the mountains rising high and steep beyond. Some\r\nmountains are covered with trees. At places you may see great bare,\r\nrough rocks on the mountain side. The scenery is very beautiful. There\r\nare often streams and broad rivers down in the valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UPPER DELAWARE.]\r\n\r\nMany lumbermen work on the mountains. Why do they cut down the trees?\r\nThe mountains give the miners work too. The men go far into the mines to\r\nbring out the useful minerals. Are there any mines in the mountains\r\nnear our home? What do the miners take from these mines?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OCEAN STEAMSHIP.\r\n  (Copyright, 1911, William H. Rau, Philadelphia.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nRIVERS\r\n\r\nWhat _river_ flows near our home? Have you ever seen it? Where were you\r\nwhen you saw it? How did it look? What did you notice along its banks?\r\nWhat was on the river? Was there any way of crossing over to the\r\nopposite bank?\r\n\r\nDid you see where the boats land? Men have built many wharves on the\r\nbanks of the rivers. If you stand on the wharf, you may see great\r\nferry-boats crowded with people. Back and forth these boats go, carrying\r\nthe people from one side of the river to the other.\r\n\r\nSometimes great steamers come up the river. They have carried people,\r\nfood and clothing on a long journey. Some boats are loaded with coal or\r\nlumber. There are many pretty sailboats and rowboats too. In some you\r\nwill see fishermen. They bring the fish back for the city people to eat.\r\n\r\nBefore the city was built there was beautiful country all along the\r\nbanks. If you travel up the river, leaving the city far behind, you will\r\nsee some fine scenery. Perhaps you will pass beautiful woods. Some of\r\nthe trees bend over the river as if they were looking at their\r\nreflections in the clear water. At places there are broad fields where\r\nthe cows come down to drink the cool water. Farther up there are hills\r\nor mountains rising far above the banks. You will notice that the river\r\nis growing narrower and narrower until it is but a small stream. If you\r\ngo down the river again, you will see that it gradually widens as it\r\nflows on to the mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nMost cities get their water supply from a nearby river. Do you know\r\nwhere the water in your bath-room comes from? When you take a drink in\r\nour school-yard what water are you swallowing? How does this water get\r\nto our home and school? Pipes run under the streets from the river to\r\nall the buildings of the town. There are big pumping stations on the\r\nriver bank to pump the water out of the river through pipes to the\r\nhouses. Millions of gallons of water are pumped each day into the homes,\r\nschools, mills and factories. For what is this water used?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUBLIC LIBRARY, NEWARK, N. J.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nPlants need more than good soil to make them grow. They will wither and\r\ndie unless they have plenty of rain to keep the earth soft and moist.\r\nThere are many places in the world where no trees, nor grass, nor plants\r\nof any kind can grow. This is because there is no water to wet the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nWe all know that clouds bring the rain; but how do the clouds get the\r\nwater? Whenever there is water on the earth, as in the rivers, the air\r\nis continually drawing up the moisture in tiny invisible drops. This\r\nmoisture rises in the air and forms clouds. When the clouds get very\r\nheavy, down comes the water which we call rain. In cold weather it is\r\nchanged into snow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELEPHANT IN THE "ZOO."]\r\n\r\nWhere there is no moisture there can be no rain, for the air cannot draw\r\nup moisture to form clouds. Where there are many rivers there has been\r\nmuch rain, and the soil is kept fertile. Plants will grow in it. Do you\r\nsee how our food, our clothing and our shelter are dependent upon\r\nrainfall? Do you see how we are kept alive by rivers?\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nThink of the many, many uses of rivers. There are thousands of useful\r\nrivers in the world.\r\n\r\nWhat are the three great necessities of human life? How do rivers help\r\nus to get _food_ and _clothing_ and to build our _homes_ and make them\r\ncomfortable?\r\n\r\nSOME USES OF RIVERS\r\n\r\n1. Water supply; washing and drinking.\r\n\r\n2. Water power; flour, textile and planing mills.\r\n\r\n3. Commerce; transportation.\r\n\r\n4. Life; fish, plants.\r\n\r\n5. Fertility of soil, rainfall.\r\n\r\n6. Beauty of scenery.\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nLook at the map of our neighborhood. See the lines that represent the\r\nriver. Notice how it bends. Does it show where bridges cross it?\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nTHE OCEAN\r\n\r\nHave you ever stood on the beach and watched the big waves roll in? The\r\ngreat _ocean_ stretches away as far as you can see. It seems to meet the\r\nsky. The weaves roll and break, and roll and break from morning till\r\nnight forever. Where there are rocks along the shore the ocean dashes\r\nagainst them. The sparkling snowy spray then leaps high into the air\r\nwith a boom and a swish!\r\n\r\n    _Note to the Teacher._--See the details for studying about the\r\n    oceans in Part II, Chapter I.\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nISLANDS AND PENINSULAS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OCEAN.]\r\n\r\nAs you sail up the river you may see large portions of land lying right\r\nout in the water. There are pieces of land lying out in the ocean too.\r\nThe water lies around them on all sides. We call such portions of land\r\n_islands_. If you were standing on the shore how could you go to an\r\nisland which you saw out in the water? How could you get there if you\r\nhad no boat? Some islands are joined to the shores by bridges.\r\n\r\nMany islands are no larger than this room. Others are so large that it\r\nwould take days to travel around them. Whether they are large or small\r\nthey have water entirely around them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PART OF A ROCKY ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nSome of us have been to a large island that has been built up into a\r\ncity. When the New York boys and girls want to leave their city they\r\nmust either go in a boat, or over a bridge, or through a tunnel far\r\nunder a river. Why? When you visit Atlantic City your train goes over a\r\nbridge into the city. Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nLook at some pictures of islands and notice how many kinds there are.\r\nSome are all wooded. Others are covered with fields. Notice one that is\r\nrocky and steep, and another that is level and built into a city.\r\n\r\nSome islands are so large as to have many cities built upon them, and\r\nthere are many farms and dense woods besides upon the same islands. Some\r\nhave many rivers flowing through them.\r\n\r\nIf you were on a large island, how could you prove that it was an\r\nisland? If you wanted to leave it, how could you do so? Notice on the\r\nmap of our neighborhood whether a river with islands in it is shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nSometimes a piece of land has water flowing only part way around it. If\r\nyou take a boat and try to go all around it, you will come to a place\r\nwhere the boat cannot go because there is land there. This land that is\r\nnearly an island, but does not have the water completely around it, is\r\ncalled a _peninsula_. Where have you seen a peninsula?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDIRECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nA LESSON IN THE SCHOOL YARD AT NOON TIME\r\n\r\nFace the sun. We are facing the south. Does the sun always lie south of\r\nus? Where was it early this morning when it arose? That was east. Where\r\nwill it be at sunset? That is west. Move your hand to show the sun\'s\r\ndaily journey from east to south to west. The sun is south of us only at\r\nnoon time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFace your shadow. Now the sun is behind you. What direction is back of\r\nyou? You are facing north. Look at the shadows of the school, of the\r\nfence, of the pole, and of all the other children. They are all falling\r\nto the north. Can you make your shadow fall east or west or south? Why\r\nnot? When only will shadows fall north? Can you think of any time when\r\nthe shadows would fall east or west? Could they ever fall south? Why\r\nnot?\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nDraw this diagram on the yard pavement, and mark the parts that are\r\nnorth, south, east and west. Stand at the middle of the cross. Face\r\nnorth. What is behind you? What direction is at your right side and\r\nwhich is at your left side? Learn these words:\r\n\r\n"When I face the north the south is behind me; the east is at my right\r\nhand and the west is at my left hand."\r\n\r\nIf you pass a weather vane on your way home, see if you can read the\r\nletters on it and find out what they mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nWith soft chalk draw a line on your desk with one end toward the north\r\nand one end toward the south. Mark N for north and S for south. Draw a\r\nline across the middle of it, and mark E for east and W for west.\r\n\r\nWhat is north of you, south of you, east of you and west of you?\r\n\r\nIn what direction from you is your teacher\'s desk?\r\n\r\nOn what side of you are the blackboards? On which side are the windows?\r\n\r\nWalk toward the north, toward the east, toward the south, toward the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nWhich boy or girl is north of you? Which pupil is west of you?\r\n\r\nWhat is south of your room? What is east of it?\r\n\r\nOn what side of your room is the corridor? On which side is the street?\r\nOn which side is the school yard?\r\n\r\nWhat is north of your teacher\'s desk? What is south of your teacher\'s\r\nchair? What is west of the table? What is east of the windows?\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POINTS OF THE COMPASS.]\r\n\r\nDraw a plan of your desk. Mark north, south, east and west upon it. Hang\r\nit up with north at the top. Draw a plan of your schoolroom. Mark the\r\nnorth, south, east and west. Hang up the plan with north at the top.\r\n\r\nLook at the plan of the town. We call it a map. North is at the top.\r\nFind the rivers. At which side of the city are they?\r\n\r\nLook at a plan of the entire school floor with all of the rooms and the\r\ncorridor. How shall we hang it?\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nMen have made plans of the city, the country, and the whole world. These\r\nplans which show the land and water are called maps. On all maps north\r\nis usually at the top.\r\n\r\nLook at the map of the whole world. How can you tell which part means\r\nland and which means water? What direction is at the top of the map, at\r\nthe bottom, at the right side, and at the left side?\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nSee where we find the north-east, south-east, south-west and north-west.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH AS A WHOLE\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLong ago wise men found out that the great earth on which we live is not\r\nflat, but round like a ball. It is so very large, and we see so small a\r\npart of it at one time, that it looks flat to us. Take a piece of paper\r\nand tear out a small hole. Hold the hole over your globe so that a small\r\npart of the surface shows through. Does the small piece of the globe\r\nlook very curved?\r\n\r\nThese men noticed ships sailing away across the water. When the ships\r\nwere far away the lower part of the boat could not be seen. More and\r\nmore disappeared till only the tops of the masts could be seen; and at\r\nlast they were gone too. If you make a little paper boat and let it sail\r\nflat across your desk and then try it over the globe, you can see how\r\nthis proves that the earth is not flat.\r\n\r\nDid you ever see an eclipse of the moon? The big curved shadow was the\r\nearth\'s shadow. Why was the shadow round?\r\n\r\nA globe shows the shape of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nLook at all of the globes and maps in the room. Find how the land and\r\nthe water are shown. Can you see any islands, any peninsulas? A tiny dot\r\nmay mean the whole city with hundreds of homes, factories and other\r\nbuildings. Do you remember how we looked down on our town from a great\r\nheight and saw the many houses? Just think of a tiny dot meaning all of\r\nour town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTERN HEMISPHERE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EASTERN HEMISPHERE]\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nHow are the rivers drawn? Think of the great wide flowing river with its\r\nwharves and its boats. It flows on for miles and miles. Some day all\r\nof its water will reach the ocean. This little black line means all of\r\nthat great broad river.\r\n\r\nWhy do we have such tiny things to represent such great things?\r\n\r\nSee this land called North America. It would take five days and nights\r\nin a fast express train to travel straight across it.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nWe can cut the globe in half and make a flat picture of the two parts as\r\nthey look when placed side by side.\r\n\r\nAnother name for the globe is sphere. "Hemi" means "half," so each half\r\nof the globe is called a "hemisphere."\r\n\r\nOne half is called the Eastern Hemisphere and the other half the Western\r\nHemisphere.\r\n\r\nIn the Western Hemisphere we have the Western Continent, which is\r\nAmerica. This Western Continent is made of two grand divisions, North\r\nAmerica and South America. Why are they so named? We live in North\r\nAmerica. Find our city and the river nearest to it. North America was\r\njoined to South America by a narrow strip of land called the _Isthmus of\r\nPanama_. Look at the map and think why millions of dollars have been\r\nspent through many years to cut through this isthmus. Now vessels can\r\npass through this Panama Canal.\r\n\r\nLook at the map of the Western Hemisphere and notice what it contains\r\nbesides the Western Continent of America. There is more water than land.\r\nThis water forms the great oceans.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have been to Atlantic City or some other seashore place and\r\nhave seen the Atlantic Ocean. Do you remember the big waves which rolled\r\nin on the sandy beach and the pretty white-caps far out? Did you see the\r\nbig nets drawn in full of hundreds of fish? Perhaps you bathed in the\r\nocean and got your mouth full of water. It did not taste like the water\r\nwe drink, for it was salty. All of the water of the ocean is salt water,\r\nbut the water of rivers is fresh.\r\n\r\nThe oceans are very large. It would take us five or six days and nights\r\non a great steamer to cross to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. In\r\nwhat direction should we go?\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nOn the western side of America there is another great ocean, the Pacific\r\nOcean. It has salt water like the Atlantic Ocean, and it also is\r\nconstantly in motion with great waves.\r\n\r\nNorth of North America, in the intensely cold region, is the Arctic\r\nOcean. Great masses of ice called icebergs and ice floes are floating\r\nthrough this ocean.\r\n\r\nFar south of South America is the Antarctic Ocean. It does not touch\r\nSouth America. It too is in a cold part of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nDo you know of any people who came here from England, Ireland, France,\r\nGermany, Italy or Russia? Their homes were in the Eastern Hemisphere.\r\nThe Eastern Hemisphere has a great mass of land called the Eastern\r\nContinent. The Eastern Continent is composed of three grand divisions,\r\nEurope, Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nFind the great island named Australia. That is sometimes called the\r\nAustralian Continent because it is so large.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nThe same oceans which are in the Western Hemisphere extend into the\r\nEastern Hemisphere. Can you name them? The Eastern Hemisphere also\r\ncontains the Indian Ocean, which is not in the Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n1. How can people go from North America to Europe?\r\n\r\n2. How do the Chinese, whose home is in Asia, come to America?\r\n\r\n3. Nearly all of the rubber which we use for automobile tires,\r\novershoes, erasers, and hundreds of other articles comes from South\r\nAmerica. Over what ocean does it come?\r\n\r\n4. On what ocean did Peary sail on his journey to the North Pole?\r\n\r\n5. When Amundsen searched for the South Pole, he started from an island\r\nnear Australia. On what oceans did he sail?\r\n\r\n6. When the first negroes were brought here from Africa over what ocean\r\ndid they come?\r\n\r\n7. What ocean trip is shortest from Africa to Asia?\r\n\r\n8. Of what use is the ocean?\r\n\r\n9. Which ocean can we reach most quickly from our home? How long would\r\nit take us to get to this ocean?\r\n\r\n10. How long would it take us to reach the Pacific Ocean?\r\n\r\n    "Behold the sea, ... splendid and strong, yet beautiful as the rose\r\n    or the rainbow; full of food, nourisher of man, purger of the world,\r\n    creating a sweet climate."--_Emerson_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SEASONS\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nWhat kind of weather are we having now? What kind will we have in July,\r\nin December, in April, in October?\r\n\r\nWhat do we call the warm season? What is the cold season? What are the\r\nmild seasons? How many seasons have we?\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nWhat kind of clothing do we need in winter?\r\n\r\nWhat work in your home is different in winter from what is done in\r\nsummer? What season gives the school janitor most work? Why?\r\n\r\nIf you live in the country you have seen how different it looks in\r\nwinter time and in summer time. Tell how. In what ways do the town\r\nstreets and country roads differ in winter and in summer?\r\n\r\nName some winter and some summer sports and games.\r\n\r\nThere are certain kinds of industries which can be engaged in only in\r\nsummer and some only in winter. Decide which of the following are summer\r\nand which are winter industries, and which require work in more than\r\none season:\r\n\r\n  Ice cutting    Building\r\n  Farming        Preserving\r\n  Lumbering      Fishing\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nWhat season do we have when the warm summer is over, and before the cold\r\nwinter has set in? How do the city streets look then? How do you think\r\nthe farm looks then?\r\n\r\nAutumn or fall is a busy time on the farm. The last of the vegetables\r\nmust be taken in and stored away for the winter. The ripe apples and\r\nnuts must be gathered too. The corn is brought in from the fields and\r\nstored in the barns for the winter food of the farm animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nAfter the long cold winter is over the days grow gradually milder and\r\nwarmer until spring has come. Are you glad when spring comes? Why?\r\n\r\nIn your schoolroom you can tell when spring is here. How pleasant the\r\nair feels as it blows in through the window! It seems to kiss us with\r\nits warm breath. You can hear the birds chirping as if they were happy.\r\nPerhaps a bee will buzz into the room. Many of the children will bring\r\nto school the dainty little spring flowers, anemones, blood root,\r\nhepatica, violets and buttercups.\r\n\r\nOut in the country all nature is busy. The tree buds are swelling and\r\nbursting. The grass and flowers are springing up. The birds are building\r\ntheir nests. The farmer is ploughing and planting his fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ZONES\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nAll parts of the earth do not have seasons such as we have. If we should\r\ntravel north we should find the climate growing colder and colder. After\r\na long time we should come to a region of intense cold. The ground would\r\nbe covered with ice and snow all the year through, both winter and\r\nsummer. This most northern part of the earth is called the North Pole.\r\nThe region around it is the North Frigid Zone. There is a South Pole and\r\na South Frigid Zone as cold as the northern one. You can see where they\r\nare on the diagram.\r\n\r\nIf we start from here and take a trip south we find it constantly\r\ngrowing warmer. At last we come to a place where it is extremely warm in\r\nboth summer and winter. That region is called the Torrid Zone because\r\n"torrid" means "hot." This hot zone extends right around the middle part\r\nof the earth. The very hottest part through the middle is the Equator.\r\nNotice on the drawing that we live in a zone between the very cold\r\nregion, or Frigid Zone, and the very warm region, or Torrid Zone. Our\r\nzone is called the North Temperate Zone. We have here spring, summer,\r\nautumn and winter. Our weather is seldom so cold as in the Frigid Zones,\r\nnor so warm as in the Torrid Zone. Our spring and autumn are mild or\r\ntemperate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: World map]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ZONES.]\r\n\r\nFind the South Temperate Zone. Its climate is just like ours. What\r\nseasons do they have there? What zone lies north of it and which south\r\nof it?\r\n\r\nCopy the diagram of the zones in your note-book.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPERATE ZONE--OUR ZONE\r\n\r\nMost of the people of the world live in one of the Temperate Zones, and\r\nmost of the great cities are in these zones. People can work better here\r\nwhere we do not have either intensely hot or intensely cold weather all\r\nof the time. There are two Temperate Zones, the North Temperate Zone\r\nand the South Temperate Zone. In which do we live?\r\n\r\nSome plants grow best in the Temperate Zones, while others live best in\r\nthe Torrid Zone. Scarcely any grow in the Frigid Zones. Name all the\r\nplants you can think of that live in our zone. These plants grow during\r\nthe summer and rest or die when winter comes.\r\n\r\nSOME PLANTS OF THE TEMPERATE ZONES\r\n\r\n  Poplar      Fruit trees\r\n  Maple       Wheat\r\n  Chestnut    Corn\r\n  Oak         Cotton\r\n  Walnut      Farm vegetables\r\n  Pine        Familiar garden plants\r\n\r\nNone of these plants can grow well in either the intense cold of the\r\nFrigid Zones or the great heat of the Torrid Zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nMany animals live better in our zone than in any other zone. They need\r\ntemperate climate.\r\n\r\nSOME ANIMALS OF THE TEMPERATE ZONES\r\n\r\n  Horse      Squirrel\r\n  Cow        Bear\r\n  Sheep      Wolf\r\n  Pig        Rabbit\r\n  Cat        Fox\r\n  Dog        Deer\r\n  Zebra      Buffalo\r\n  Giraffe    Goat\r\n\r\nWhich are domestic and which are wild animals? Describe each and tell\r\nhow it is useful to man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZEBRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nTHE HOT ZONE\r\n\r\nIf we take a long trip to the south we find it growing warmer and warmer\r\nuntil at last we have reached a land where it is warm all the year\r\nthrough. This is the Torrid Zone.\r\n\r\nThe plants do not rest nor die in winter there, for there is no cold\r\nweather. These plants keep right on growing through the year. Many of\r\nthe trees grow very, very high and have tremendous leaves.\r\n\r\nIn some cities there are large greenhouses where the Torrid Zone plants\r\nare raised. The temperature must be kept as warm there as in the Torrid\r\nZone. These are some of the Torrid or Hot Zone plants:\r\n\r\n  Palm      Rubber    Giant ferns\r\n  Coffee    Bamboo    Banana\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE TORRID ZONE.]\r\n\r\nIn the forests of the Hot Zone the trees grow very close together. The\r\nsunlight cannot shine through. It is impossible to walk through these\r\nforests without first chopping out a pathway with a hatchet.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nIn these forests live many of the fierce animals which you have seen in\r\ncages in the Zoological Gardens or at the circus.\r\n\r\nSOME ANIMALS OF THE TORRID ZONE\r\n\r\n  Monkey     Elephant\r\n  Camel      Snake\r\n  Lion       Parrot\r\n  Tiger      Rhinoceros\r\n  Leopard    Wild Cat\r\n\r\nDescribe these and tell of what use they are.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TROPICAL JUNGLE.]\r\n\r\nWhy are some of the buildings in the Zoological Gardens so warm?\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe Torrid Zone was the first home of the negroes before they were\r\nbrought to America. There are many negroes and Indians living in the\r\nHot Zone now. Many are but half-civilized. Some are savage. As they do\r\nnot need large warm homes like ours, some live in small huts made of the\r\nbranches of trees, earth and straw. A few of these homes together make a\r\nvillage. These people get their food by hunting in the forest and\r\nfishing in the rivers and ocean. They also eat the fruits that grow wild\r\nin the forests. There are some cities in the Torrid Zone, but none of\r\nthem are very large. These towns have been built mostly by the civilized\r\nwhite people. The streets are often shaded with beautiful palm trees.\r\nThe buildings are generally small, as the people live and work out of\r\ndoors as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nWHAT THE TEMPERATE AND TORRID ZONES DO FOR EACH OTHER\r\n\r\nThe people living in the Torrid Zone send to us Temperate Zone people\r\nmany useful things that do not grow here. These are some of them:\r\n\r\n  Cocoanuts    Chocolate\r\n  Bananas      Pepper\r\n  Coffee       Palm leaves\r\n  Rubber       Mahogany\r\n\r\nIn return the Temperate Zone people send to the Torrid Zone inhabitants\r\nthings that they do not have. In the Hot Zone there are no large\r\nfactories in which to manufacture goods, so we send there:\r\n\r\n  Farm tools     Guns\r\n  Woven goods    Knives\r\n  Books          Clothing\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nTHE COLD ZONES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ESKIMO FAMILY.]\r\n\r\nAt the most northern part of the earth and at the most southern part are\r\nregions of intense cold. The earth is entirely covered with ice and snow\r\nall of the year. The water is filled with masses of floating ice and\r\nsnow. Our coldest winter days are not nearly so cold as the climate of\r\nthe North and South Frigid Zones. It is even hard to tell which is land\r\nand which is water.\r\n\r\nOf course no trees, nor grass, nor plants, nor animals, nor people of\r\nany kind can live in that intense cold. At the parts near the Temperate\r\nZones, where it is slightly warmer, there are some very small dwarfed\r\ntrees not more than a foot or two high, and perhaps a little moss. It is\r\nhere that the Eskimos live; but most of the North Frigid Zone and the\r\nSouth Frigid Zone is a stretch of frozen whiteness on all sides, with no\r\nliving thing of any kind. During the summer the sun never sets, so that\r\nthere is twilight all night. In winter the sun never rises above the\r\nhorizon, so there are months of darkness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESKIMO BOY.]\r\n\r\nThese frozen lands are the regions through which so many brave explorers\r\nhave traveled trying to find the most northern part called the North\r\nPole, and the most southern part, the South Pole. Many of these\r\nfearless men have never returned from the Frigid Zones. They have\r\nstarved or been frozen to death.\r\n\r\nAt last, after trying for twenty-seven years, Robert E. Peary, an\r\nAmerican, reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. All Americans are\r\nvery proud of this brave, determined, fearless man, who would not stop\r\nuntil he had done what he set out to do.\r\n\r\nRoald Amundsen, a brave Norwegian, reached the South Pole on December\r\n14, 1911, after suffering many hardships.\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nPeary has written a book in which he tells about his travels. Up in the\r\nnorth he met the Eskimos, who belong to the Indian family. They live in\r\nsnow houses in the winter. In summer, which is also very cold, they live\r\nin skin tents. These Eskimos dress in warm furs. They have no schools\r\nnor churches, but they are a kind and peaceful people. They are very\r\ngood to the white explorers in the north.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo travels mostly on foot, but carries loads on sledges drawn by\r\ndogs. The Eskimo\'s dogs are his best friends. Without them he could not\r\nmanage to carry home the animals he kills for food and clothing. He also\r\nuses boats which he makes of skins.\r\n\r\nMany of the Frigid Zone animals are covered with heavy fur. Why?\r\n\r\nSOME FRIGID ZONE ANIMALS\r\n\r\n  Dog         Polar Bear    Seal\r\n  Reindeer    Whale         Penguin\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nWHAT THE FRIGID AND TEMPERATE ZONES DO FOR EACH OTHER\r\n\r\nMen go to the Frigid Zones and catch seals and other animals and bring\r\nback the skins for the Temperate Zone people.\r\n\r\nThe whale, which lives in the ocean of the Frigid Zone, is also very\r\nuseful. From it we get the whalebone, oil and also a fertilizer to help\r\nour farm crops to grow. Great quantities of whale meat are eaten by some\r\npeople of the Temperate Zones.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos of the Frigid Zone are glad to have from the Temperate Zones\r\nmanufactured articles like pans, knives and guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n1. What different kinds of people have you ever seen?\r\n\r\n2. Why are the Temperate Zone people more civilized than the Frigid Zone\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n3. Name some animals of each zone.\r\n\r\n4. In which zones is it best to live? Why?\r\n\r\n5. As you sit at your desk point toward the North Pole, toward the South\r\nFrigid Zone, the North Frigid Zone, the South Temperate Zone, the\r\nEquator, the South Pole, the Torrid Zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nNORTH AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nFind where we live on the map of North America. Locate our home on all\r\nof our maps and globes.\r\n\r\nNorth America is a very large portion of land. You could sail along its\r\nshores for thousands of miles. At its widest part you could not cross it\r\nin a fast express train in less than five days and nights. There are\r\nthousands of cities in this great grand division, for there are millions\r\nof people here. Most of them are white or Caucasian. There are also many\r\nIndians, negroes, Eskimos and Mongolians.\r\n\r\nMuch of the land is dense forest, and much is fertile farm land. A small\r\npart has so few rivers and such a scarcity of rainfall that the land is\r\ndry and arid. Little grows upon it but coarse grass and cactus. This\r\nregion is called a _desert_.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nNorth America stretches far up north into the North Frigid Zone and far\r\nsouth into the Torrid Zone, but most of it lies in the North Temperate\r\nZone. What plants and animals live in North America? It is separated\r\nfrom Asia by a narrow strip of water called Behring Strait. How did\r\nNorth America used to be connected with South America? Why is the\r\nseparation called a canal and not an isthmus?\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARNEGAT LIGHTHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nThree great oceans wash the shores of North America. Name them. The\r\ncoast line is very irregular. Notice on the map that at places part of\r\nthe ocean extends far into the land, forming _gulfs_ and _bays_. Hudson\r\nBay, Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of St. Lawrence are all parts of which\r\nocean? The waves are not so high in the bays and gulfs as in the open\r\nocean. The land keeps off some of the wind. Vessels that are waiting to\r\nbe laden with cargo lie in these sheltered gulfs and bays. Why?\r\n\r\nAt many places along the shore the land juts out into the ocean in\r\n_capes_. Many of these points of land have special names. Look on the\r\nmap for them. There are light houses built on most of these capes to\r\nwarn the ships in the dark and in the storms to keep away from the\r\ndangerous rocks and shore. A cape is often a pleasant place for a summer\r\nhome. There is so much water around it that the sea breezes sweep across\r\nit and make it delightfully cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nDo you remember how we spoke of the river with its many boats and\r\nsteamers? There are hundreds of rivers in North America flowing for\r\nmiles until at last they reach the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nThere are many high hills, some so very high as to be called\r\n_mountains_. There is a chain of these mountains called the Eastern\r\nHighlands along the eastern part of North America. They extend for many\r\nmiles north and south. The scenery in this region is very beautiful. The\r\nmountains are covered mostly with forests of pine, spruce, oak, maple,\r\nchestnut and other trees. These are cut down for lumber. In the wilder\r\nparts of these forests live squirrels, rabbits, bears and snakes. At\r\nplaces the trees have been cut down to make room for fields of grain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SURFACE MAP OF NORTH AMERICA.]\r\n\r\nThe mountains are full of useful minerals. Great quantities of coal and\r\niron are mined in the Eastern Highlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe highest mountains in North America are the Western Highlands in the\r\nwestern part. One great chain or range extends the entire length of\r\nNorth America from the Arctic Ocean down into South America. Great\r\nforests grow on these mountains. In many places are huge masses of rock\r\non which nothing grows, so this range has been called the Rocky\r\nMountains. It is always bitter cold at the top of some of these\r\nmountains because they reach so high. Even in summer they are capped\r\nwith snow. Nowhere in the world can more magnificent scenery be found.\r\n\r\nWest of the Rocky Mountains is the Pacific Mountain System.\r\n\r\nGold and silver are mined in the Western Highlands. In the wild parts of\r\nthe forests, where no people live, deer, wolves and bears may be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nThe low land between the mountains we call _plains_ or _valleys_. There\r\nis a Great Central Plain which reaches from the Eastern Highlands to the\r\nWestern Highlands. There are many rivers in this valley. The Mississippi\r\nand the Missouri Rivers are the largest.\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nYou remember how rivers make rainfall and fertile soil. The Great\r\nCentral Plain has some of the best farm land in the world. In the\r\nnorthern cold part hardly anything grows, but in the central part great\r\nquantities of corn, grain, fruits and vegetables are raised. In the\r\nsouth the plantations or farms raise sugar cane, cotton, tobacco, rice\r\nand coffee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEEP ON THE PLAINS.]\r\n\r\nOn the western plains great herds of thousands of sheep and cattle are\r\nraised.\r\n\r\nIn the Great Central Plain are hundreds of cities where the farm\r\nproducts are sold. Here, too, the farmers buy the farm tools and\r\nmachinery which they need. In the city mills the wheat is ground into\r\nflour and the logs from the forests are sawed into planks or made into\r\nfurniture. The cattle and sheep are killed and the meat prepared for our\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nEast of the central part of the Great Central Plain are five of the\r\nlargest lakes in the world. When you are in a boat in the middle of any\r\none of them you cannot see the land on any side. They are called the\r\nGreat Lakes. Their names are Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and\r\nOntario. They are all joined together, and from the last a large river\r\nruns into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It has the same name as the gulf.\r\n\r\nThere are many other smaller lakes in North America where the land is\r\nlow and the water from the rivers and streams fills up the hollows.\r\nNearly all have fresh water like the rivers. A very few, like Great Salt\r\nLake, contain salt water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCOUNTRIES OF NORTH AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nNorth America contains several different countries. Each is under a\r\nseparate government. These countries are United States, British America,\r\nDanish America, Mexico and Central America. Each country has its own\r\nruler and its own laws. Each has a special flag and its own kind of\r\nmoney and postage stamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nWe live in the best one of these countries, for we have the best ways of\r\nobtaining our food, our clothing and our shelter. Our climate is good,\r\nfor we are in the North Temperate Zone. Our soil is very fertile. The\r\nGreat Central Plain of North America passes through the central part of\r\nthe United States. We raise fruits, vegetables, corn, wheat, rice and\r\nsugar for food. We have immense ranches for raising cows and sheep too.\r\nOur clothing is supplied by the thousands of sheep we raise and from the\r\ncotton we grow here. The Western and Eastern Highlands pass through our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: North America]\r\n\r\nWe have a great quantity of lumber, stone, coal and iron for making our\r\ncomfortable homes. In what part of the country is each of these\r\nproducts obtained? Why? Right in our own United States is found nearly\r\neverything that is necessary to make us comfortable and happy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTTON FIELD.]\r\n\r\nWe have hundreds of towns with homes, factories, schools, hospitals and\r\nchurches. Over every public building floats our beautiful flag, the\r\nStars and Stripes.\r\n\r\nOur laws are made in the capital, which is named Washington, after\r\nGeorge Washington, our first president. Find Washington on the map. How\r\nlong would it take to go to Washington from our home? It is a beautiful\r\ncity. The Capitol building is one of the finest in the world. The\r\nPresident of the United States lives in the White House.\r\n\r\nAlaska, in the north-west, and the island of Porto Rico, in the\r\nsouth-east, belong to the United States. We own other islands in other\r\nparts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n_British America_ is our next neighbor on the north. It includes all of\r\nthe Dominion of Canada and the Island of Newfoundland. It belongs to\r\nEngland or Great Britain in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNTAIN GOAT.]\r\n\r\nThe Great Central Plain and the Western Highlands pass through it, and\r\nyet it is not a rich country with many people like the United States.\r\nCan you tell why?\r\n\r\nThere are large crops of fruit and grain in the southern part only of\r\nBritish America. In this part only are there any large cities. The few\r\npeople in the northern part go there to hunt the animals for furs and to\r\nfind gold. Many whales live in the cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean and\r\nHudson Bay. Are they of use to man?\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n_Danish America_ is the name given to the two islands Greenland and\r\nIceland, because they belong to Denmark, a country of Europe.\r\n\r\nGreenland lies in which zones? What kind of climate has it? A few white\r\npeople and some Eskimos live in the southern part. The northern part has\r\nno life at all.\r\n\r\nWhat do you know of the people, the plants and the animals of this\r\nregion?\r\n\r\nIn what zone is Iceland? Why is the climate very cold? Many fish are\r\ncaught in the ocean around Iceland. The people on the island are able to\r\nraise little but grass to feed their sheep and cattle.\r\n\r\nThere are many mountains in Iceland. Some of them send out steam and\r\nmelted rock and are called _volcanoes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n_Mexico_ is our southern neighbor. This country has a president and a\r\ngovernment somewhat like ours.\r\n\r\nBoth Indians and white people live in Mexico. The climate is so warm in\r\nthe valleys that the people living there cannot work so hard as they do\r\nin the United States. So they do not have large factories and many fine\r\nschools, hospitals and libraries as we have. Why do they not build these\r\non the mountains where the climate is pleasant?\r\n\r\nThey have large plantations where they raise rubber, sugar, cotton,\r\ncoffee, tobacco and fruit and many cattle.\r\n\r\nThe great Western Highlands extend down through Mexico, and silver,\r\ncopper and coal are mined in them. Some of these mountains are\r\nvolcanoes. What does this mean?\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nCentral America is still warmer than Mexico. It is entirely in what\r\nzone? The plants and animals are much like those of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nThe West Indies consist of many islands. The largest are Cuba, Haiti,\r\nJamaica and Porto Rico. Which belongs to the United States? These\r\nislands have a warm climate. What do you think is raised on the\r\nplantations by the white people and negroes?\r\n\r\nThe West Indies separate a part of the ocean from the main Atlantic\r\nOcean. This smaller part is called the _Caribbean Sea_. Notice what\r\ncountries it touches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTRIPS\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nSuppose you were to sail from New York City to Iceland.\r\n\r\n1.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
