They\r\nhave also been so chosen as to convey a somewhat fair idea of the\r\nrelative value and productivity of authorship in the three great\r\nEnglish-speaking communities of the world--the mother countries, our\r\nneighbours\' country, and our own.\r\n\r\nWhile a limited space, if nothing else, prevents the collection here\r\nmade from being a complete anthology, yet it does pretend to represent\r\nthe authors selected in characteristic moods, and (in so far as is\r\npossible in a school book, and a reading text-book) to present a\r\nsomewhat fair perspective of the world of authorship. It may be said\r\nthat, if this be so, some names are conspicuously absent: McGee,\r\nCanada\'s poet-orator; Parkman, who has given to our country a place in\r\nthe portraiture of nations; William Morris, the chief of the modern\r\nschool of romanticism; Tyndall, who of the literature of science has\r\nmade an art; Lamb, daintiest of humorists; Collins, "whose range of\r\nflight," as Swinburne says, "was the highest of his generation." Either\r\nfrom lack of space, or from some inherent unsuitableness in such\r\nselections as might otherwise have been made, it was found impossible\r\nto represent these names worthily; but as they are all more or less\r\nadequately represented in the _Fourth Reader_, the teacher who may wish\r\nto correct the perspective here presented may refer his pupils to the\r\npieces from these authors there given. It may be added, too, that\r\nthe body of recent literature is so enormous, that no adequate\r\nrepresentation of it (at any rate as regards quantity) is possible\r\nwithin the limits of one book.\r\n\r\nThe selections in poetry, with but three necessary exceptions, are\r\ncomplete wholes, and represent, as fairly as single pieces can, the\r\nrespective merits and styles of their authors. The selections in prose\r\ncannot, of course, lay claim to this excellence; but they are all\r\ncomplete in themselves, or have been made so by short introductions; and\r\nit is hoped that they too are not unfairly representative of their\r\nauthors. In many cases they are of somewhat unusual length; by this,\r\nhowever, they gain in interest and in representative character.\r\n\r\nIn some of the prose selections, passages have occasionally been\r\nomitted, either because they interfered with the main narrative, or\r\nbecause, as they added nothing to it, to omit them would be a gain of\r\nspace. In most cases these omissions are indicated by small asterisks.\r\n\r\nAll the selections, both in prose and in verse, have been made with\r\nconstant reference to their suitableness for the teaching of reading.\r\nThey are fitted to exemplify every mode of expression, except, perhaps,\r\nthat appropriate to a few of the stronger passions. It is not pretended\r\nthat they are all simple and easy. Many of them will require much\r\nstudy and preparation before they can be read with that precision of\r\nexpression which is necessary to perfect intelligibility. The\r\nchronological arrangement precludes grading; the teacher will decide\r\nin what order the selections are to be read.\r\n\r\nThe introductory chapter is mainly intended to assist the teacher in\r\nimparting to his pupils a somewhat scientific knowledge of the art of\r\nreading. Of course the teacher will choose for himself his mode of\r\ndealing with the chapter, but it has been written with the thought that\r\nhe should use it as a convenient series of texts, which he might expand\r\nand illustrate in accordance with his opportunities and judgment.\r\nExamples for illustration are indispensable to the successful study of\r\nthe principles described, and they should be sought for and obtained by\r\nthe teacher and pupils together (whenever possible they should be taken\r\nfrom the READER), and should be kept labeled for reference and practice.\r\nIf the application of these principles be thus practically made by the\r\npupils themselves, they will receive a much more lasting impression of\r\ntheir meaning and value than if the examples were given to them at no\r\ncost of thought or search on their part.\r\n\r\nTo the teacher it is recommended that he should not be contented with\r\nthe short and necessarily imperfect exposition of the art of reading\r\ntherein given. The more familiar he is with the scientific principles\r\nthe more successfully will he be able to direct the studies and\r\npractices of his pupils. Works on elocution are numerous and accessible.\r\nDr. Rush\'s _Philosophy of the Voice_ is perhaps the foundation of all\r\nsubsequent good work in the exposition of voice culture. Professor\r\nMurdoch\'s _Analytic Elocution_ is an exhaustive and scholarly treatise\r\nbased upon it, and to the plan of treatment therein fully developed the\r\npractical part of the introductory chapter has largely conformed.\r\n\r\nThe pleasing task remains of thanking those authors who have so kindly\r\nresponded to requests for permission to use selections from their works:\r\nto President Wilson, for a sonnet from _Spring Wild Roses_, and for _Our\r\nIdeal_; to Mr. Charles Sangster, for two sonnets from _Hesperus_; to Mr.\r\nJohn Reade, for two poems from _The Prophecy of Merlin_; to Mr. Charles\r\nMair, for the scenes from _Tecumseh_; and to Professor C. G. D. Roberts,\r\nfor _To Winter_.\r\n\r\nTo Miss A. T. Jones, thanks are due for permission to use _Abigail\r\nBecker_, recently published in the _Century Magazine_. The heroic acts\r\ndescribed in this poem seem so wonderful, so greatly superior to woman\'s\r\nstrength, even to human strength and endurance, to accomplish, that were\r\nit possible to doubt its truthfulness, doubt one certainly would.\r\nNevertheless the poem is not only strictly in accordance with the facts,\r\nit is even within and below them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n_(The Titles of the Selections in Poetry are printed in Italics.)_\r\n\r\n\r\n  NUMBER.

For even a moderate proficiency in the art of reading two\r\nrequirements are essential: (1) A cultivated mind quick to perceive the\r\nsequence of thoughts which the words to be read logically express, and\r\nequally quick in its power sympathetically to appreciate the sentiment\r\nwith which the words are informed--the feeling, emotion, passion, which\r\npervades them--but which they suggest rather than actually portray; and\r\n(2) a voice so perfected that its utterances fall upon the ear of the\r\nlistener with pleasing effect, and so flexible that it can be managed\r\nskilfully to convey to him the full meaning and force of all the ideas\r\nand sentiments formally expressed by the words or latent in them. Of\r\nthese two requirements the first is undeniably the more important; and\r\nthat training in the art of reading in which the close, persistent, and\r\nliberal study of literature for its own sake has not proceeded _pari\r\npassu_ with the requisite exercises for the development of the powers of\r\nthe voice and with the study of the principles of vocal interpretation,\r\nhas resulted in a meretricious accomplishment of very illusive value.\r\n\r\nNor will the special study and accurate mastery of a number of\r\nindividual selections give that readiness of mental apprehension which\r\nis indispensable to a good reader. The ability quickly to recognize\r\nword-forms and to utter them with ease, to catch the drift of ideas, and\r\nto feel ready sympathy with change and flow in sentiment, is not to be\r\nhad without a long course of wide and varied reading. No one can become\r\na good reader by passing through, no matter how carefully, a set of\r\nreading text-books merely. Pupils should be encouraged to read for\r\nthemselves. They should, of course, be guided in their selection of\r\nreading matter, and they should be helped to acquire a taste for that\r\nwhich is purest and most helpful in literature; but unless they form a\r\n_habit_ of reading, and of reading thoughtfully and with precision, they\r\ncan never become good readers.\r\n\r\nIn oral reading, readiness and accuracy depend largely upon the\r\nalertness and flexibility of the vocal organs, and to secure ease and\r\nexcellence in the working of their delicate mechanism much practice is\r\nnecessary. The pupil should persistently read aloud. A practice of this\r\nsort, watchfully pursued, with a reasonable degree of self-discipline in\r\nthe correction or avoidance of errors, is helpful not alone in obtaining\r\na mastery of the reading art, and in mental culture,--it is equally\r\nbeneficial as a physical exercise. It will, however, be much more\r\nefficacious of good, both of mind and of body, if pursued in accordance\r\nwith those principles of voice culture and of vocal interpretation,\r\nwhich experience and special study have established.\r\n\r\nBut only a small proportion of all the reading that is done, is oral\r\nreading. It is _silent_ reading that is universally employed as an\r\ninstrument of study, of business, of amusement. As a rule, however, very\r\nlittle provision is made for the acquirement of a facility in silent\r\nreading; this, it is thought, will result as a by-product of the regular\r\ntraining in oral reading. Almost the reverse of this is true. Ease and\r\nflexibility of articulation, quickness in catching the drift of ideas,\r\nand readiness in varying the tones of the voice in the utterance of\r\nwords so as impressively to portray their latent sentiment,--all this is\r\npossible with those alone to whom difficult word-forms, complex\r\nsentence-structures, and the infinite variety and play of thought and\r\nemotion, are more or less familiar through such a wide range of reading\r\nas only the silent prosecution of it makes possible.\r\n\r\nThe art of oral reading, however, though not so generally needful as\r\nsilent reading, is still of great importance to everyone in respect of\r\nits practical utility simply,--though few of those whose duty it is to\r\nread aloud in public, do so either with accuracy or grace; as an\r\naccomplishment which may be used to give pleasure to others, it is, when\r\nperfectly possessed, not excelled by any other; so that as an\r\nacquisition which puts one in a position of vantage either for\r\nbenefitting one\'s self or for bestowing delight or benefit upon others,\r\nit is worth every necessary struggle for its attainment.\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable results of oral reading when systematically\r\npursued as a school study, is the effect which it has in improving the\r\ntones of the voice for ordinary conversation and discourse, and in\r\nsecuring some measure of orthoepy as a fixed habit of utterance.\r\nConversational speech is notoriously slovenly. The sonority of our\r\nvowels is lost, and their distinguishing qualities are obscured;\r\nand with unnoticed frequency our consonants are either dropped or\r\namalgamated with one another. Yet, while amendment in these matters\r\nis to be striven for, there is nothing that the teacher who wishes\r\nto establish habits of orthoepy has to be more watchful in guarding\r\nagainst, than bestowing upon his pupils an affected or mincing\r\nutterance, all the more ludicrous and objectionable, it may be,\r\nin that a certain set of words are pronounced with over-nicety,\r\nwhile almost all others are left in a state of neglected vulgarity.\r\n\r\nToo frequently the study of oral reading is pursued with reference\r\nsolely to the prospective public use of the art in the declamation of\r\nprepared passages; and the elocution-master\'s science has been brought\r\ninto some discredit by wide discrepancies between the performances of\r\nhis pupils in their well-drilled and often hackneyed selections and\r\ntheir ability to read unfamiliar pieces at sight. It is quite true that\r\nvoice culture is greatly aided by the close study and frequent rendering\r\nof selections suitably chosen for the elocutionary difficulties which\r\nthey present; but it should never be forgotten that good reading, the\r\nsort of reading which the schoolmaster should above all else endeavor to\r\nmake his pupils proficient in, implies the ability so to read a plain\r\naccount, a story, an oration, a play, or what not, _at sight_, with\r\nabsolute correctness as to pronunciation, with such clearness of\r\narticulation and appropriateness of sentence utterance as will make it\r\nperfectly audible and intelligible to one\'s auditors, and with such\r\nsuitable and impressive intonations as will put them in full possession\r\nof those emotions which may be said to be the essence or spirit of the\r\npiece;--and, moreover, to do all this with pleasure to one\'s hearers and\r\nwith ease to one\'s self. Now as comparatively few readers are ever\r\nrequired to read in public, and as in the home-circle everyone ought to\r\nread, it is plain that the first duty of the teacher of elocution is to\r\ndevelop in his pupils a mastery of such a style of reading as is\r\nappropriate to small audiences; and, _then_, if he have time and\r\nopportunity, to extend and amplify the practice of his art so as to fit\r\nsuch as are capable of fuller mastery of it to appear before greater\r\naudiences. For though all voices are capable of being much improved\r\nthrough cultivation, few only can be adapted to the requirements of\r\na large auditorium; and the care and attention which should be devoted\r\nto the benefit of all should not be spent for the advantage merely of\r\nthe few.\r\n\r\nAnd moreover, those practices and studies which voice culture and the\r\nattainment of a knowledge of the principles of vocal interpretation\r\ndemand, may be pursued by all in common. That alone which is necessary\r\nfor the public reader or orator, is a more extended, and, perhaps, a\r\nmore earnest and thoughtful practice.\r\n\r\nAlthough practices for the improvement of the voice cannot proceed far\r\nwithout attention to the principles of vocal interpretation, and though\r\nthe study of the latter necessarily includes the former, yet for the\r\nsake of clearness the elementary principles of voice culture may be\r\ndiscussed separately from their application in the interpretation of\r\nthought and sentiment.\r\n\r\nWith respect both to articulation and expression _the generic properties\r\nof the voice are five_, namely: _Quality_, _Pitch_, _Force_, _Time_,\r\n_Abruptness_. Of these properties there are, of course, many modes or\r\ndegrees, but the voice must, in every tone that it utters, manifest\r\nitself in some mode or other of each; and it is the possibility of\r\ninfinite choice in the ways of combining the modes that gives to vocal\r\nexpression its infinite possibility of variety. The principles of voice\r\nculture will be best understood, however, if these properties be\r\nconsidered separately.\r\n\r\n=Quality= has reference to the _kind_ of the voice in respect of its\r\nsmoothness or roughness, sonority or thinness, musicalness or harshness;\r\nalso in respect of the completeness of its vocality.\r\n\r\n=Pitch= has reference to the degree of elevation or depression in what\r\nis called in music the _scale_. It may be used specifically, in\r\nreference to single tones or syllables (either as to their opening, or\r\nas to their whole utterance), or generally, as descriptive of the\r\nprevailing tone or note which the voice assumes in reading a sentence or\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n=Force= has reference to the power or intensity with which the sounds of\r\nthe voice are uttered. When force is used in the utterance of single\r\nsyllables, in whole or in part, it is spoken of as =Stress=.\r\n\r\n=Time= is rate of utterance. It is used with reference both to single\r\nsyllables, and to phrases, sentences, and passages. In regard to single\r\nsyllables it is sometimes called =Quantity=. In the consideration of\r\ntime may be included that of _pauses_ and _rhythms_.\r\n\r\n=Abruptness= has reference to the relative suddenness with which\r\nsyllables may be uttered. It may vary from the most delicate opening to\r\na forcible explosion.\r\n\r\nVocality depends upon respiration. All exercises, therefore, which are\r\neffective in increasing the vigor, freedom, and elasticity of the\r\nbreathing apparatus, may be taken as initiatory steps in voice culture;\r\nand, in moderation, they should be practised continually. Full, slow\r\ninspirations followed by slow, and, as far as possible, complete\r\nexpirations; full, quick inspirations similarly followed; full\r\ninspirations followed by sudden and forcible expirations; full, deep\r\ninspirations, followed by slow, slightly but distinctly audible\r\nexpirations, as in deep sighing; these and similar practices may be\r\npursued. What is to be aimed at is to secure complete control of the\r\nbreath, especially to the degree that, with perfect deliberateness, it\r\ncan be equably and smoothly effused.\r\n\r\nIn all exercises where vocality is required it is best _first_ to use\r\nthe sound of _\xc3\xa4_, as in _far_, for in this sound the quality of the\r\nhuman voice is heard in most perfection, and in uttering it the vocal\r\norgans are most flexible and most easily adapt themselves to change. It\r\nmay be preceded by the aspirate _h_, or by some consonant, as may be\r\nthought necessary.\r\n\r\nIn effective speaking or reading, _with respect to the abruptness and\r\nrapidity of expiration there are three modes of utterance_: the\r\n=effusive=, by which the voice is poured forth smoothly and equably, the\r\n=expulsive= and the =explosive=. Of these three modes the effusive is by\r\nfar the most important, but the others, and especially the expulsive,\r\nhave their uses also. These modes will be illustrated in the following\r\nexercise:\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE.--1. After a full and deliberate inspiration let the\r\n    expiration of the element _h_ be gently effected, until the\r\n    lungs are exhausted--the aspiration coming from the very depths\r\n    of the throat. Let this be repeated with the syllable _h\xc3\xa4h_,\r\n    audibly whispered. This is _effusive_ utterance.\r\n\r\n    2. After a full and deliberate inspiration let the expiration of\r\n    the element _h_ be suddenly effected, the expiration being\r\n    continued until the whispering sound vanishes in the bottom of\r\n    the throat. Let this be repeated with the syllable _h\xc3\xa4h_,\r\n    audibly whispered. This is _expulsive_ utterance.\r\n\r\n    3. Let the exercise be the same as in (2) except that the\r\n    expiration is to be much more forcibly effected, and completed\r\n    almost instantaneously. This is _explosive_ utterance.\r\n\r\nIn the cultivation of the voice either one of two ends is generally kept\r\nin view--its improvement for speaking or its improvement for singing;\r\nbut progress may be made towards both ends by the same study, and those\r\nexercises which benefit the singing voice benefit the speaking voice,\r\nand _vice versa_. _The distinction between speaking tones and singing\r\ntones should be clearly understood._ Musical tones are produced by\r\nisochronous (equal-timed) vibrations of the vocal organs continued for\r\nsome length of time. Hence, a musical tone is a _note_, which may be\r\nprolonged at will without varying in pitch, either up or down. A\r\nspeaking tone, on the contrary, is produced by vibrations which are not\r\nisochronous; it is not a _note_, properly so called, and can not be\r\nprolonged, without varying in pitch. Musical tones are _discrete_,--the\r\nvoice passes from pitch to pitch through the intervals silently. In\r\nspeaking, _every_ tone, however short the time taken in uttering it,\r\npasses from one pitch to some other through an interval _concretely_,\r\nthat is, with continuous vocality; though, with respect to one another,\r\nspeech syllables, like notes in music, are discrete. This may be\r\nexemplified by uttering the words, "_Where are you going?_" In singing\r\nthese words, they may be uttered on the same note, or on different\r\nnotes, or, indeed, with different notes for the same word; but the voice\r\n_skips_ from note to note through the intervals. In speaking the words,\r\neach is uttered with an inflection or intonation in which the voice\r\nvaries in pitch, but passes through the interval concretely; the\r\nseparate words, however, and the separate syllables (if there were any)\r\nbeing uttered discretely. Musical utterance might be graphically\r\nillustrated by a series of horizontal lines of less or greater length\r\nsucceeding one another at different distances above or below a fixed\r\nhorizontal line. In a similar notation for speech utterance the lines\r\nwould all be curved, to represent the concrete passage through the\r\nvarious intervals. _It is the concrete intonation of every syllable and\r\nmonosyllabic word which gives to speech its distinctive character from\r\nmusic._ Each syllable and monosyllabic word is called a =concrete=, and\r\n_it is with the concrete in all its various possibilities of utterance\r\nthat voice culture has mainly to do_.\r\n\r\nThe intervals traversed by the voice in uttering the concrete are very\r\nvariable. Using the musical scale for reference it may be said that in\r\nordinary speech they are generally of but one, or, at most, two notes.\r\nIn animated discourse or passionate utterance the intervals may be\r\ngreater. For illustration, let the pronoun "_I_" be uttered in a tone of\r\ninterrogative surprise; a concrete with a rising interval will be the\r\nresult. The more the surprise is emphasized, especially if indignation\r\nbe conjoined with it, the greater will be the interval that the voice\r\npasses through in uttering the concrete. If the word "_lie_" be given\r\nimmediately after the pronoun with the same intensity of feeling, the\r\nvoice discretely descends from the high pitch heard at the end of the\r\nutterance of the pronoun, and in uttering the next concrete, again\r\nascends through an interval, of less or more extent according to the\r\nemphasis which is imparted to it.\r\n\r\nAgain, in speech of sorrow, murmuring, piteous complaint, and the like,\r\nconcrete intervals of less extent than those used in ordinary discourse\r\nare often heard. Thus, if the sentence "_Pity me, kind lady, I have no\r\nmother_," be uttered with a plaintive expression, concretes with small\r\nintervals will be distinctly noticeable; but it will be also noticed\r\nthat with respect to one another the syllables are discretely uttered,\r\njust as in the sentence where the concrete intervals were much greater.\r\n\r\nWithout intending a scientifically accurate and rigid statement, it may\r\nbe said (again borrowing the terminology of music) that in ordinary\r\nspeech the concretes are uttered with intervals of a _second_, or at\r\nmost a _third_; that in very expressive or impassioned utterance\r\nintervals of a _fifth_ or an _octave_ are frequently used; and that the\r\nmode of progression from syllable to syllable is _diatonic_, that is,\r\nnot concretely, but discretely from tone to tone; and further, that in\r\nplaintive language, the syllables are uttered concretely with intervals\r\nof a _semitone_ only, but that the mode of progression from syllable to\r\nsyllable is still discrete.\r\n\r\nSometimes, but rarely, syllables are uttered _tremulously_, or with a\r\n_tremor_; that is, with constituent intervals of less than a semitone,\r\nuttered discretely in rapid succession, and passing, in the aggregate,\r\nthrough an interval of more or less width. An exaggerated form of this\r\nutterance may be heard in the neighing of a horse.\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE.--1. Utter the syllable _p\xc3\xa4_ as a concrete, with rising\r\n    and falling intervals, severally, of a _second_, _third_,\r\n    _fifth_, and an _octave_; also with intervals of a _semitone_;\r\n    also with a _tremor_. Let the exercise be varied so as to\r\n    include many degrees of initial pitch. Use a diagram of a\r\n    musical staff for reference.\r\n\r\n    2. Read with exaggerated impressiveness, "_Am_ =I= _to be your\r\n    slave?_ =No!="\r\n\r\nIn the pronunciation of the letter [=a], as in _pate_, two sounds are\r\nheard: the first is that of the name of the letter, which is uttered\r\nwith some degree of fulness; the second is that of _[=e]_ in _mete_,\r\nbut, as it were, tapering and vanishing;--in the meantime the voice\r\ntraverses a rising interval of one tone, that is, of a second. The\r\nutterance of these two sounds, although the sounds themselves are\r\ndistinct, is completely continuous, from the full opening of the one to\r\nthe vanishing close of the other, and it is impossible to say where the\r\nfirst ends and where the last begins. It is essential, however, to\r\nconsider them separately. The first is called the =radical movement=,\r\nand the second the =vanishing movement=; and these together constitute\r\nthe entire concrete.\r\n\r\nAll the vowels do not equally well exemplify in their utterance a\r\n_distinction of sound_ in their radical and vanishing movements, because\r\nsome vowel sounds are less diphthongal than others, and some, again, are\r\npure monophthongs; but _these two movements and the concrete variation\r\nof pitch, the result of one impulse of the voice, are the essential\r\nstructure of every syllable_, and are characteristic of speech-notes as\r\ncontradistinguished from those of song.\r\n\r\nWhen the radical and vanishing movements are effected smoothly,\r\ndistinctly, and without intensity or emotion, commencing fully and with\r\nsome abruptness, and terminating gently and almost inaudibly, the result\r\nis the =equable concrete=. This of course may be produced with\r\nintervals, either upward or downward, of any degree--tone, semitone,\r\nthird, fifth, or octave. It must be said, however, that some syllables,\r\nand even some vowels, lend themselves more easily than others to that\r\nprolonged utterance which is essential to the production of wide\r\nintervals and the perfectness of the vanishing movement.\r\n\r\nThe equable concrete is the natural, simple mode of utterance; but under\r\nthe influence of interest, excitement, passion, and so on, the utterance\r\nof the concrete may be greatly varied from this by means of _stress_, or\r\nforce applied to some part or to all of its extent. The different\r\nvariations may be described as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) =Radical Stress=, where force is applied to the opening of the\r\nconcrete. (It should be said that a slight degree of radical stress is\r\ngiven even in the equable concrete, producing its full, clear opening.)\r\n\r\n(2) =Loud Concrete=, where force is applied throughout the whole\r\nconcrete, the proportion of the radical to the vanish remaining\r\nunaltered.\r\n\r\n(3) =Median Stress=, where force is applied to the middle of the\r\nconcrete, producing a swell, or impressive fulness.\r\n\r\n(4) =Compound Stress=, where force is applied in an unusual degree\r\nto each extremity of the concrete.\r\n\r\n(5) =Final Stress=, where force is applied to the end of the concrete,\r\nthe radical stress being somewhat diminished in fulness.\r\n\r\n(6) =Thorough Stress=, where force is so applied that the concrete has\r\nthe same fulness throughout.\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE.--With the syllable _p\xc3\xa4_ exemplify the _equable\r\n    concrete_ and the several varieties of _stress_, using different\r\n    degrees of initial or radical pitch, and the various intervals\r\n    of the tone, semitone, third, fifth, and octave. The exercises\r\n    for the radical stress should be first aspirated, then repeated\r\n    with full vocality.\r\n\r\nBesides the forms of the simple rising and falling intervals in which\r\nthe concrete is generally uttered, there is another form, called the\r\n=wave=, effected by a union of these modes. It is of two varieties: (1)\r\nwhere a rising movement is continued into a falling movement, called the\r\n=direct wave=; (2) where a falling movement is continued into a rising\r\nmovement, called the =inverted wave=. Waves may pass through all\r\nvarieties of intervals, and may be either (1) _equal_, where the voice\r\nin both members passes through the same interval; or (2) _unequal_,\r\nwhere in one flexion the interval traversed by the voice is greater than\r\nin the other.\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE.--With the syllable _p[=a]_ exemplify the different\r\n    kinds of _waves_, with the same variations of radical pitch,\r\n    interval, and stress, as before.\r\n\r\nThe elementary sounds of speech are of three natural divisions; the\r\n_tonics_, the _subtonics_, and the _atonics_.\r\n\r\nThe =Tonics= are the simple vowels and diphthongs. They are of perfect\r\nvocality; they admit the concrete rise and fall through all the\r\nintervals of pitch; they may be uttered with more abruptness than the\r\nother elements; and being capable of indefinite prolongation they can\r\nreceive the most perfect exemplification of the vanishing movement. They\r\nmay be said to be: _[a:]_, as in _all_; _\xc3\xa4_, as in _arm_; _[.a]_, as in\r\n_ask_; _[)a]_, as in _an_; _[=a]_, as in _ate_; _\xc3\xa2_, as in _air_;\r\n_[=e]_, as in _eve_; _[)e]_, as in _end_; _\xc3\xab_, as in _err_; _[=i]_, as\r\nin _ice_; _[)i]_, as in _inn_; _[=o]_, as in _old_; _\xc3\xb6_, as in _or_;\r\n_[)o]_, as in _odd_; _[=u]_, as in _use_; _[)u]_, as in _up_;\r\n_[=o][=o]_, as in _ooze_; _[)o][)o]_, as in _book_; _oi_, as in _oil_;\r\n_ou_, as in _out_. (There are various ways of arranging and classifying\r\nthese.)\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE.--Exemplify generally the equable concrete, loud\r\n    concrete, radical stress, and median stress, with upward and\r\n    downward intervals, with clear, sharp openings, and with\r\n    gradually attenuated vanishes, upon each of the _tonic\r\n    elements_.\r\n\r\nThe =Subtonics= possess the properties of vocality and prolongation in\r\nsome degree, but much less perfectly than the tonics, and their vocality\r\n(known as the _vocal murmur_) is the same for all. They are as\r\nfollows:--_b_, _d_, _g_, _v_, _z_, _y_, _w_ (as in _woe_), _th_ (as in\r\n_then_), _zh_ (as _z_ in _azure_), j (as in _judge_, by some considered\r\nnot elementary), _l_, _m_, _n_, _ng_ (as in _sing_), _r_ (as in _ran_),\r\nand _r_ (as in _far_). They can not, without great effort, be given an\r\nabrupt opening, and so are not capable of much radical fulness, but from\r\ntheir property of vocality they can receive, to a considerable degree,\r\nan exemplification of the vanishing movement.\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE.--Utter the word _bud_ slowly, and detach from the rest\r\n    of the word the obscure murmur heard in pronouncing the first\r\n    letter: this is the _subtonic_ represented by _b_. Utter this\r\n    sound with different degrees of initial pitch, and with\r\n    different intervals, both downward and upward. Produce as full\r\n    an opening of the radical movement as possible, but do not\r\n    attempt to give it much stress. Obtain in every case a distinct\r\n    vanish. Be careful not to convert the subtonic into a tonic.\r\n    Proceed in a similar manner with the other subtonics. Then,\r\n    distinctly obtaining the subtonics, unite them severally with\r\n    the sound of _\xc3\xa4_, first forcibly, then more gently, producing\r\n    such syllables as _b\xc3\xa4_, _d\xc3\xa4_, etc., which may be rendered with\r\n    upward and downward intervals, and with different degrees of\r\n    initial pitch. Finally, with such syllables as _\xc3\xa4b_, _\xc3\xa4d_, _\xc3\xa4g_,\r\n    _\xc3\xa4v_, etc., exemplify all the varieties of stress.\r\n\r\nThe =Atonics= correspond with the first eleven of the subtonics as given\r\nabove, from which they differ almost alone in having _no_ vocality. They\r\nare _p_, _t_, _k_, _f_, _s_, _h_, _wh_ (as in _when_), _th_ (as in\r\n_thin_), _sh_, and _ch_ (as in _child_, by some considered not\r\nelementary).\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE.--1. Form a list of such words as _pipe_, _tote_,\r\n    _kick_, _fife_, _siss_, etc., and severally utter them slowly,\r\n    holding the final element for a moment, and then letting the\r\n    breath escape suddenly; then, holding the initial letter firmly\r\n    for a moment let it come forcibly against the sound of the\r\n    remainder of the word, producing an abrupt opening, and radical\r\n    stress of the vowel concrete. 2. Aspirate strongly the atonics\r\n    as given above.\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE RECAPITULATORY.--1. Produce the syllable _p\xc3\xa4_ in an\r\n    articulate whisper in all the different varieties of pitch,\r\n    interval, and stress. 2. Repeat with such syllables as _paw_,\r\n    _pooh_, _p[=o]h_, etc. 3. Utter these syllables (1) expulsively,\r\n    (2) explosively, with varying intervals both upward and\r\n    downward, and producing distinct and clearly attenuated\r\n    vanishes. 4. Select some passage of poetry involving passionate\r\n    thought, and read in articulated whispers, with appropriate\r\n    intonations, somewhat exaggerated, it may be. Let the intervals\r\n    and stresses be slowly and distinctly given. 5. Repeat the\r\n    exercise in a half whisper. 6. Next read the passage over\r\n    several times in pure vocality, without exaggeration, increasing\r\n    the strength of the utterance until it is as full and ringing as\r\n    possible. Care must be taken that the utterance is in reality\r\n    full and ringing, not sharp and hard. Let the pitch chosen be\r\n    not too high--as low as possible; and let the tones come mainly\r\n    from the chest and lower part of the throat.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--In all the exercises care should be taken that they be performed\r\neasily and naturally, with perfect deliberation and without undue force;\r\nelse they will be harmful rather than useful.\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE IN CONCRETE INTERVALS CONTINUED.--1. Read with\r\n    appropriate intonations: "_Did you say [a:], as in all?_"--"_No,\r\n    I said \xc3\xa4, as in arm_,"--producing in the emphatic syllables\r\n    suitable rising or falling intervals of _one tone_. Then repeat,\r\n    but with greater emphasis, producing intervals of a third, a\r\n    fifth, or an octave. Vary the sentences so as to include all the\r\n    tonic elements. 2. With each tonic element, severally, produce\r\n    first a rising and then a falling interval, each of a tone; then\r\n    intervals of a third, a fifth, and an octave. 3. Extend the\r\n    exercise so as to produce with each element, and with all the\r\n    various intervals, a series or succession of rising and falling\r\n    intervals, thus: _rising, falling, rising, falling_, etc. Use\r\n    the blackboard and the musical scale for illustration and\r\n    reference.\r\n\r\nSyllables vary greatly in their capacity for prolongation, and in this\r\nrespect are classified into _immutable_, _mutable_, and _indefinite_.\r\n\r\n=Immutable Syllables= are almost incapable of prolongation; they are\r\nthose which end in one of the abrupt atonic elements, _p_, _t_, _k_; as\r\n_tip_, _hit_, _kick_; or in one of the abrupt subtonics, _b_, _d_, _g_;\r\nas _tub_, _thud_, _pug_. Some syllables that so end, by virtue of tonic\r\nor subtonic elements which they may contain, are capable of _some_\r\nprolongation; for example, _warp_, _dart_, _block_, _grab_, _dread_,\r\n_grog_. These are called =Mutable Syllables=.\r\n\r\n=Indefinite Syllables= are capable of almost indefinite prolongation;\r\nthey are those which terminate in a tonic, or any subtonic except one of\r\nthe three abrupt subtonics, _b_, _d_, _g_; for example, _awe_, _fudge_,\r\n_hail_, _arm_.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--It must be remembered that when for the sake of exercise or\r\neffect syllables are extended in time, they must be so uttered that\r\ntheir identity is not impaired,--that is, their enunciation must be\r\nfree from mouthing.\r\n\r\nAs has been remarked before our pronunciation of vowels is notoriously\r\ncareless; but by a little attention anyone can easily free himself from\r\nthis reproach. Frequent practice in the accurate enunciation of the\r\ntonic elements as given above, and a habit of watchfulness established\r\nas to the orthoepy of those which are most easily obscured, in all words\r\nin which they occur, will soon secure, if not a resonant, sonorous\r\nutterance with respect to the tonic elements, at least a correct\r\npronunciation. But the correct and distinct pronunciation of the\r\nsubtonic, and especially of the atonic, elements, when they occur,\r\nas is so frequent in English words, in combination, is not so easily\r\naccomplished; and orthoepy, in this respect, as a _habit_, cannot be\r\nsecured without great care and incessant practice. For example, the\r\nword _months_ is habitually pronounced by almost everyone as if it\r\nwere spelled _munce_. The following list for practice will afford\r\nmaterial to begin with; other lists should be prepared by the teacher.\r\n\r\n_Plinth, blithe, sphere, shriek, quote, whether, tipt, depth, robed,\r\nhoofed, calved, width, hundredth, exhaust, whizzed, hushed, ached,\r\nwagged, etched, pledged, asked, dreamt, alms, adapts, depths, lefts,\r\nheav\'ns, meddl\'d, beasts, wasps, hosts, exhausts, gasped, desks,\r\nselects, facts, hints, healths, tenths, salts, builds, wilds, milked,\r\nmulcts, elms, prob\'d\'st, think\'st, hold\'st, attempt\'st, want\'st,\r\nheard\'st, mask\'st._\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE.--Utter the words in the above list in distinct\r\n    articulate whispers; then with vocality, softly and gently.\r\n    Avoid hissing and mouthing.\r\n\r\nWhile, in reading, distinct enunciation is an excellence to be aimed at,\r\nyet the words of a sentence should not be uttered as if completely\r\nsevered from one another. Every sentence falls naturally into _groups_,\r\nthe several groups being composed of words related in sense; and for\r\nimpressive reading the words of each group should be _implicated_, or\r\ntied together. For example, in the line, _Once upon a midnight dreary,\r\nwhile I ponder\'d, weak and weary_, there are naturally three groups; in\r\nthe line, _The quality of mercy is not strain\'d_, there is but one. In\r\nthese groups the terminal sound of each word is implicated with the\r\ninitial sound of the succeeding word. If the terminal sound is a tonic,\r\nor a flowing subtonic, the implication consists of a gentle murmuring\r\nprolongation of the terminal element coalescing with the initial element\r\nof the next word; if the terminal element is a flowing atonic the\r\nprolongation will not be accompanied by a murmur; but in either case the\r\nvocal organs, while prolonging the sound of one word, prepare, as it\r\nwere, to begin the next. If the terminal element be one of the abrupt\r\nsubtonics the vocal murmur is difficult to produce, and in this case,\r\nand also when the terminal element is an abrupt atonic, there is a\r\nsuspension of the voice for a time equal to that occupied by the\r\nmurmuring prolongation in the other cases; but the organs keep the\r\nposition which they have in finishing the one word until they relax to\r\ntake position for the utterance, with renewed exertion, of the opening\r\nsound of the next.\r\n\r\nIt must be added that this implication is not confined to the component\r\nwords of a group; for the sake of impressiveness the groups themselves\r\nare often implicated,--but by suspension of the voice and a maintenance\r\nof the vocal organs in their previous position, before they suddenly\r\nrelax to form the opening sound of the first word in their next group,\r\nrather than by the murmuring prolongation above described.\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE.--Read with suitable implication: (1) _O Tiber! father\r\n    Tiber! to whom the Romans pray, a Roman\'s life, a Roman\'s arms,\r\n    take thou in charge this day!_ (2) _But still the patriot, and\r\n    the patriot-bard, in bright succession raise, her ornament and\r\n    guard._\r\n\r\nThe nicety with which implication should be effected depends, like\r\nexactness of articulation, upon the gravity, complexity, fervor, grace,\r\nbeauty, or other distinguishing and elevated quality of the thoughts and\r\nsentiments contained in the words to be read. Common-place ideas are\r\ncouched, as a rule, in common-place language, and require no nice\r\ndiscrimination of sounds, or other refinement of utterance, for their\r\nfull rendering; but in true poetry and impassioned prose implication is\r\nno mean instrument of effectual interpretation.\r\n\r\nThe speaking voice, like the singing voice, is capable of utterance\r\nthrough a considerable range of pitch--in highly cultivated voices, of\r\nthree octaves; in less highly cultivated voices, of one octave; but for\r\nall voices, not perverted by bad habit, there are three or four notes,\r\nof moderate height, upon which utterance is most easy and natural, and\r\nmost capable of great and sustained effort. These notes should be\r\nselected as the =normal pitch= of discourse.\r\n\r\nIn speaking or reading, except in certain infrequent cases, the _whole_\r\nof the breath expired from the lungs should be utilized in producing\r\n=pure vocality=. Should any breath be spent in aspiration, or in\r\nhissing, or in guttural enunciation, the vocality is said to be\r\n=impure=. Impure vocality, it is true, has its own appropriate use, in\r\nthe representation of certain emotional states of the mind. Pure\r\nvocality is heard naturally in the tones of children at play; but in\r\nadults, through carelessness or injudicious education, it is often\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of the voice is very complicated and not thoroughly\r\nunderstood. It is a matter of common experience, however, that in the\r\nutterance of tones of low pitch, whether speech tones or musical, the\r\nvoice seems to come from the chest rather than from the head; and, in\r\nthe utterance of tones of high pitch, on the other hand, it seems to\r\ncome from the head rather than from the chest; so that all tones are\r\nsaid to belong either to the _lower_ or _chest register_, or to the\r\n_higher_ or _head register_. As both chest tones and head tones may be\r\nobscured by impurities, and their resonance diminished or destroyed by\r\ndefective enunciation, the pure, clear, ringing utterance of tones of\r\nboth registers should be constantly striven for. The normal pitch of\r\nutterance, referred to above, should always be such that the tones\r\ncomprised in it can be produced either from the head or from the chest,\r\nat will; but for sustained efforts, for the best effects both of reading\r\nand of oratory, the chest tones are much to be preferred, since, as\r\ncompared with head tones, they are capable of being produced with\r\ngreater resonance and penetrating power, and, for any considerable\r\nlength of time, with greater ease to the speaker.\r\n\r\nAll tones of the human voice, whether speaking or musical, whether of\r\nthe head or of the chest, are spoken of as having =quality=, or\r\n=timbre=, and the term is also used more generally in reference to the\r\nwhole compass of utterance. The quality of the voice is its most\r\ndistinguishing characteristic, and it is upon its cultivation and\r\nimprovement that the greatest efforts of the student should be spent.\r\nPure voice is usually spoken of as being manifested in two qualities,\r\nthe _natural_ and the _orotund_.\r\n\r\n=Natural Quality= may be described as a head tone to which some degree\r\nof resonance is given by the chest; but the brilliancy of its resonance\r\nis produced by its reverberation against the bony arch of the mouth. It\r\nmay, of course, vary in pitch, but tones of low pitch that are intended\r\nto be impressive are most suitably rendered in orotund quality. In its\r\nperfect manifestations, the natural quality should be clear, ringing,\r\nlight, and sparkling,--if it be possible to describe its characteristics\r\nby such metaphorical words.\r\n\r\n=Orotund Quality= is the result only of cultivation, but no speaker or\r\nreader can produce those finer effects which are the appropriate symbols\r\nof strong and deep emotion, whose voice cannot assume this mode at will.\r\nIt differs from the natural mode in obtaining from the chest a greater\r\nsupply of air, and a deeper and fuller resonance, and the reverberations\r\nseem to be against the walls of the pharynx, or posterior regions of the\r\nmouth, rather than against the palate, or upper part of the mouth. In\r\nfulness, strength, and ringing quality, it is superior to the natural\r\nmode, but not distinct from it; in clearness and smoothness it should be\r\nequal to it. As it befits a chest tone rather than a head tone, it is\r\nnatural to utterances in medium and low pitch; but it must not be\r\nconfounded with low pitch simply, nor must its characteristic fulness be\r\ntaken for loudness simply. With the orotund, as well as with the natural\r\nquality, all the voice modes previously described may be conjoined.\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE.--1. With the syllable _h\xc3\xa4h_, make an expiration in the\r\n    voice of whisper, forcing slowly all air out from the chest.\r\n    Then give to this expiration vocality, producing the\r\n    reverberation far back in the mouth: the resulting utterance is\r\n    a _hoarse exemplification of the orotund_. With the mouth in the\r\n    position of a yawn, making the cavity of reverberation as large\r\n    as possible, repeat the exercise until the utterance can be\r\n    produced smoothly and without hoarseness. 2. Form similar\r\n    syllables containing other tonic elements, and make similar\r\n    exercises, taking care to produce a smooth, effusive utterance.\r\n    3. Select a sentence such as "_Roll on thou deep and dark blue\r\n    ocean, roll_," abounding in long open vowels and indefinite\r\n    syllables, and using suitable intonations read it in low pitch,\r\n    with full, resonant chest tones. Then gradually raise the pitch,\r\n    still obtaining the tones from the chest and uttering them with\r\n    full resonance. 4. With such syllables as _h\xc3\xa4h_, _you_, _now_,\r\n    _man_, _war_, _hail_, _fool_, practise in orotund voice the\r\n    various exercises for pitch, concrete intervals, waves, stress,\r\n    etc., previously suggested. 5. Read with feeling and appropriate\r\n    intonations selected sentences from compositions of elevated or\r\n    impassioned diction, as "Solomons\'s Prayer" (p. 35), "The Hymn"\r\n    (p. 68), "France" (p. 205).\r\n\r\nOf the various qualities (as they are called) of impure voice, the\r\n=Aspirate=, the =Sibilant=, and the =Guttural= are defined with\r\nsufficient clearness, by their names. Though these modes can be\r\nappropriately used only occasionally, nevertheless they are of great\r\nvalue to the reader, and the voice should be trained to assume them\r\nwhenever necessary. Great care must be exercised, however, that\r\nimpurities shall never be present as characteristics of _normal_\r\nutterance; this, whether from the head or chest, should be distinct,\r\nsonorous, and smooth, and should exhaust every particle of air expired.\r\n\r\nAnother impure quality is the =Pectoral=, which is an aspiration\r\nproduced, as it were, from the lowest cavities of the chest; and still\r\nanother is the =Falsetto=, an unnatural voice, that seems to be produced\r\nentirely in the upper cavities of the head. The employment of the\r\nFalsetto at any time, either in speaking or reading, is of doubtful\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n    EXERCISE.--1. With the syllable _h\xc3\xa4h_ exemplify severally the\r\n    aspirate, guttural, and pectoral qualities, first with\r\n    insufficient vocality, then with sufficient. Exemplify the\r\n    sibilant impurity with such syllables as _pish_, _false_,\r\n    _traitress_, _miscreant_. In those exercises employ intervals of\r\n    varying lengths, different degrees of initial pitch, and the\r\n    several varieties of stress; and let the utterances be made\r\n    effusively, expulsively, and explosively. 2. Select appropriate\r\n    passages in "The Raven" (p. 258) for exercise in natural,\r\n    orotund, aspirate, guttural, and pectoral qualities. Read the\r\n    passages severally with appropriate intonations,--it may be\r\n    somewhat exaggeratingly. Then read the whole poem feelingly,\r\n    with appropriate, but not exaggerated intonations.\r\n\r\nSo far, what has been said has had reference mainly to the cultivation\r\nand improvement of the voice, by the analogies and description of the\r\nvarious effective modes in which it can be manifested, and by the\r\nsuggestion of suitable exercises for increasing its endurance, strength,\r\nflexibility, and resonance. It remains now to discuss shortly some of\r\nthe principles of _vocal interpretation_,--that is, to discuss what\r\nmodes of voice-action are appropriate to the representation of the\r\nvarious emotions which the wide range of literature presents to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nIt must be said in respect of principles that only broad and easily\r\nverifiable ones are of use, and even these may be abused by a too\r\nrigorous adherence to them. The best rule that can be given, as indeed\r\nit is founded on a principle of widest application, is that laid down in\r\nthe _Fourth Reader_:--_To give a faithful sympathetic attention to the\r\nfull meaning and sentiment of what is read, and to manage the voice so\r\nas effectively to express this meaning and sentiment;_ since this will\r\nalways ensure a certain measure of appropriateness, if not the full\r\nperfection of it. And it cannot be too much emphasized that even the\r\nfullest knowledge and most patient study can establish for the reading\r\nof any selection, or passage, or sentence, _none but general\r\ndirections_, since the same words may very frequently be rendered in\r\nseveral ways, with differences of pitch, time, stress, quality,\r\nimplication, and so on, but with equal effectiveness and equal\r\nappropriateness. And, on the other hand, any whole selection, even the\r\nsimplest, is far too complex in its thought and sentiment to be disposed\r\nof in one general analysis, which shall predetermine the pitch, tone,\r\nand stress, and the prevailing width of the intervals, and the direction\r\nof the inflections; all these will vary from paragraph to paragraph, and\r\nfrom sentence to sentence, even from word to word. To sum up, it may be\r\nsaid that good reading demands as indispensable, quick-witted\r\nintelligence, ready sympathy, and a voice so trained as to be flexible\r\nand resonant; if the reader have this much endowment his reading will\r\nalways be effective, and, moreover, appropriate and impressive.\r\n\r\n_All diction may be roughly described as exhibiting one of three states\r\nof feeling:_ (1) that in which feeling, as it is generally understood,\r\nis almost wanting; (2) that in which it is present in some considerable\r\ndegree; (3) that in which the feeling is present in an extreme degree,\r\ndominating the ideas which the several sentences logically express. To\r\nthe first division, which may be called the =diction of discourse=,\r\nbelongs all language indicative of a quiet state of mind--formal\r\nstatement, narrative, description, simple argument or reasoning: it is\r\nthe language of all ordinary writing. To the second division, which may\r\nbe called the =diction of sentiment or feeling=, belongs all language\r\nwhich indicates that the mind of the speaker, real or supposed, is in a\r\nstate of moderate excitement; that he is interested in the relation of\r\nhimself to others, and, consequently, in the effect of his utterances\r\nupon them; or that, subjectively, he is interested in himself: it is the\r\nlanguage of admiration, reverence, awe, sincerity, dignity, of pathos,\r\nsupplication, penitence. To the third division, which may be called the\r\n=diction of passion=, belongs all language expressive of deeper\r\nexcitement and more vehement interest than that described as animating\r\nthe diction of feeling: it is the language of earnest or anxious\r\ninterrogation, of passionate ejaculation, of powerful appeal, strong\r\naccusation, and fierce denunciation; also, of contempt, derision, scorn,\r\nloathing, anger, hate, and so on.\r\n\r\nVoice, as we have seen, possesses five generic properties, pitch, force,\r\nquality, time, and abruptness; and, in every spoken word, it must assume\r\nsome mode of _each_ of these properties, manifesting them in\r\nco-existence. This conjoint mode, or _vocal sign_, as it is called,\r\nshould be the appropriate expression of the thought and feeling of which\r\nthe word, in its place in the sentence, is the _graphical sign_. Hence,\r\nas each word in a sentence may be said to have its appropriate vocal\r\nsign, so each variety of diction may be said to have its appropriate\r\nvocal expression,--a latitude of choice in the constituent modes, and a\r\nconsequent indeterminateness in the resulting expression, being, of\r\ncourse, always conceded.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate vocal expression for the diction of discourse may be\r\nsaid to consist of the following modes:--normal pitch, simple\r\nintonations, and waves of a second, moderate force, the equable\r\nconcrete varied by slight radical stress, in quality the natural mode,\r\nin abruptness sufficient sharpness of opening to effect clear\r\narticulation, and in time a moderate rate with effusive utterance.\r\n\r\nAs the diction rises above this plain unimpassioned character, and\r\nbecomes more and more informed with feeling and sentiment, the\r\nconstituent vocal signs, and hence the whole vocal expression, become\r\nmore and more expressive. In pitch there is frequent variation: in\r\nexpressions of joy, astonishment, or for command, the voice assumes\r\nnaturally a somewhat higher elevation; and with equal naturalness it\r\ndescends below its normal level to utter the language of grave, solemn,\r\nand reverential feeling. Again, inasmuch as the interval of the second\r\nis the plainest and simplest within the command of the voice, in such\r\ndiction as we are now considering, intervals of a third, a fifth, or\r\neven an octave, may be heard, both in simple intonations and in waves.\r\nForce, too, will not be unvaryingly applied, but will be greater or less\r\naccording as energy or passion may demand. In stress the equable\r\nconcrete will give place to the radical or to the final, to express\r\nenergetic resolve; or, in the language of pathos, exaltation, reverence,\r\nsupplication, and so on, to the median--the most effective of all modes\r\nfor the expression of such deep feeling as is compatible with slow\r\nutterance. In time the rate of utterance will vary with the syllabic\r\nquantities, these being short and crisp in the language of vivacious\r\nconversation, but extended, and with distinct, attenuated vanishes, in\r\ngrave and important monologue. In quality, whenever the diction,\r\ndeparting from its simple character, becomes pervaded by some deep\r\nemotion, the natural mode will give place to the orotund. And while\r\neffusive utterance is always the prevalent mode, it will give place to\r\nthe expulsive mode or to the explosive, when energy of thought or force\r\nof passion requires it so.\r\n\r\nThus, _as the diction rises_ from plain discourse to the language of\r\nfeeling, _the appropriate vocal expression gathers intensity and becomes\r\nmore varied_, assumes, as may be said, brighter colors and displays\r\ngreater contrasts; and so, in the third class of diction, the diction of\r\npassion, it displays its intensest and most vivid modes--its brightest\r\ncolors, its deepest contrasts.\r\n\r\nAs it is in a general sense only, that diction can be understood to be\r\nreferrible to three classes, so also, in a general sense only, can it be\r\nunderstood that any particular sentence or passage has its appropriate\r\nvocal expression. All that is intended is simply this: an analysis of\r\nthe sentence, or passage, or selection, gives to the careful student a\r\ncertain conception of the quality and intensity of the feeling or\r\npassion that pervades it; this is to be interpreted, as well as may be,\r\nby the most appropriate vocal signs possible--the whole constituting the\r\nvocal expression suitable to the piece. In respect to its pervading\r\nemotion, the selection will have what is called a =drift=, or general\r\ntendency, towards one of those states described as characteristic of the\r\ndiction of discourse, the diction of feeling, and the diction of\r\npassion, respectively; and it is the business of the reader to watch for\r\nthis drift, which of course may vary from passage to passage, from\r\nsentence to sentence, and sometimes from word to word, and to interpret\r\nit as best he may.\r\n\r\nTo indicate what modes of voice utterance are naturally most appropriate\r\nto the expression of these various emotional states and drifts, it will\r\nbe best to take up, one by one, the different properties of the voice,\r\nand the several modes in which they are manifested, and to state\r\nbriefly, and in general terms, the emotional state or drift of which it\r\nis an appropriate expression. (With respect to quality and abruptness\r\nthis will be sufficiently done indirectly.) The student then must for\r\nhimself, if he wishes to apply these results to the reading of any\r\nselected passage, first by analysis ascertain what are the emotional\r\nstates which it involves, what are its prevailing drifts, then in\r\nrespect to each property of the voice choose the suitable mode for the\r\ninterpretation of these several states or drifts, conjoin the selected\r\nmodes into appropriate vocal signs, and with these form the vocal\r\nexpression that suitably interprets the whole passage. _The teacher, or\r\nthe teacher and student together, should select from the_ READER, _or\r\nelsewhere, sentences or passages that fitly exemplify the different\r\nmodes; these should be written upon a black-board, or in some other way\r\npreserved, and be referred to frequently for practice both in voice\r\nculture and in vocal interpretation._\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PITCH. Pitch must be considered under three heads: first, as\r\nreferring to the prevailing elevation of tone assumed by the voice in\r\nthe reading of a whole sentence, passage, or selection, called _general_\r\nor _sentential pitch_; second, as referring to the degree of elevation\r\nassumed by the voice in the utterance of the opening, or radical, of any\r\nsyllable, called _initial_ or _radical pitch_; third, as referring to\r\nthe tone-width of the intervals in the utterance of the syllable\r\nconcrete.\r\n\r\n=Sentential Pitch= in its various modes is descriptive of the general\r\nposition in the scale taken by the tones of the voice in uttering a\r\nsentence or passage. It may be spoken of as _medium_, _high_, and _low_.\r\n=Medium Pitch= should correspond with the _normal pitch of discourse_\r\npreviously described. It is natural to the expression of all\r\nunimpassioned thought, and also of all emotions, except the livelier,\r\nand the deeper and more intense. =High Pitch= and =Low Pitch= are only\r\nrelative terms. They do not represent fixed and definite modes of\r\nutterance; and all that can be said is, that for the interpretation of\r\nwhat may be called the lighter feelings and emotions, such as\r\ncheerfulness, joy, exultation, interest, and so on, also for the\r\nexpression of raillery, facetiousness, humorous conversation, laughter,\r\nand the like, sentential pitch of a degree somewhat higher than normal\r\npitch is appropriate; and, on the other hand, for the interpretation of\r\nwhat may be called the graver and deeper feelings, such as awe,\r\nreverence, humility, grief, and melancholy, and the more impassioned\r\nemotions, as disgust, loathing, horror, rage, despair, as well as for\r\nthe expression of all very serious and impressive thought, sentential\r\npitch of a degree somewhat lower than normal pitch is appropriate. The\r\ndegree of elevation and depression must be determined by the judgment\r\nand good taste of the reader; but it must be borne in mind that this\r\ndegree may vary from passage to passage, and from sentence to sentence,\r\nand even from phrase to phrase.\r\n\r\nIn every style of diction, no matter how unimpassioned it may be, there\r\nwill be frequent changes in the train of thought, and frequent changes\r\nin the intensity of feeling; to represent these changes there should be\r\ncorresponding variations, or =transitions in sentential pitch=. These\r\ntransitions also serve another purpose, namely, to indicate an\r\ninterpolated or parenthetical idea. In making transitions the voice\r\nfollows the general law of all vocal interpretation; strong contrasts in\r\nthought and feeling are marked by transitions of wide intervals, and\r\nlesser contrasts by lesser intervals.\r\n\r\n_Transitions in pitch are naturally accompanied by corresponding changes\r\nin force, rate of utterance, and phrasing_; and, like all other modes of\r\nexpression, these receive their color from the intensity of thought and\r\nfeeling of which they are the symbols. For example, in the rendering of\r\na parenthetical clause (since, as a rule, the thought expressed in the\r\nparenthesis is of less gravity than the thought in the main sentence),\r\nthe voice will manifest itself in lighter force and generally in quicker\r\nmovement, that is, in lighter, less contrasting colors; but whether the\r\npitch be raised or lowered depends upon the sentential pitch appropriate\r\nto the main sentence,--it should be in contrast with that. And it may be\r\nremarked in passing, that the reading of the parenthesis should end with\r\na phrase melody similar to that appropriate to the words immediately\r\nbefore the parenthesis, so that the ear may naturally be carried back to\r\nthe proper place in the main clause for the continuation of the\r\nexpression of the principal thought.\r\n\r\n=Radical Pitch=, that is the pitch with which the opening of a syllable\r\nis uttered, is, in respect of appropriate employment, the most important\r\nelement of reading or speaking; but all that can be done here, is to\r\ncall attention to this, and leave the student to exercise his taste and\r\njudgment in regard to its use. The importance of appropriately varying\r\nradical pitch so as to impart melody to continued utterance will be seen\r\nat once if a simple sentence (for example, "_Tom and Jim sat on a log_")\r\nbe read, first in that monotonous voice (that is, with unvarying radical\r\npitch) so often heard in the labored reading of improperly taught young\r\nchildren, and then with those appropriate intonations heard in animated\r\ncolloquy. When properly rendered, even if read with but little\r\nanimation, each syllable, or concrete, passes through an interval of a\r\nsecond, and the several syllables are discretely uttered; but the\r\n_radical pitch varies from syllable to syllable_, forming a diatonic\r\nmelody. _For the rendering of any given sentence in appropriate diatonic\r\nmelody, positive direction as to the order of succession in respect of\r\nradical pitch cannot be given_; the same words may be uttered with equal\r\nappropriateness in many varieties of melody. The ignoring of this fact\r\nhas led to the most absurd pretensions.\r\n\r\nA group of two or three syllabic concretes is called a =phrase of\r\nmelody=; and as phrases vary with respect to pitch, in the order of\r\nsuccession of the radicals of their constituent syllables, they receive\r\ndifferent names: such as the _monotone_, in which the radicals are all\r\non the same pitch; and the _ditone_ and the _tritone_, groups of two\r\ntones and three tones respectively, with radicals of different pitch;\r\nand, again, the concretes in these phrases may have upward or downward\r\nintonations: but fixed rules cannot be laid down for their use. The\r\nreader must bear in mind, however, that it is upon the tasteful use of\r\nphrases and cadences, that is, upon the tasteful employment of\r\nvariation in radical pitch, that the melody of uttered language depends;\r\nand that if it be devoid of this melody, it is both wearisome and\r\nunimpressive to the hearer.\r\n\r\nThe intonations of the voice must necessarily be through either rising\r\nintervals or falling intervals, and there is a generic difference in the\r\nmeaning of these. =The rising interval= is heard naturally at the end of\r\na direct question; that is, one to which "_yes_" or "_no_" is an\r\nexpected answer, as "_Are you going home?_" The suspensive tone which\r\nthe voice assumes at the end of the interrogation is indicative of\r\nincompleteness of thought; and _indication of incompleteness is the\r\ncharacteristic function of all rising intervals_.\r\n\r\n=The falling interval= is heard naturally at the close of a complete\r\nstatement, as "_I am here_"; and hence, _words indicating completeness,\r\npositiveness, resolution, are appropriately uttered with downward\r\nintervals_. In effecting a downward intonation the voice operates in one\r\nof two ways: either the _weaker mode_, in which it descends from a\r\nradical pitch at or near the current tone to a lower pitch; or the\r\n_stronger mode_, in which it assumes discretely a radical pitch as much\r\n_above_ the current tone as the emphasis requires, and descends\r\nconcretely either to the current tone or below it.\r\n\r\nAs every sentence is more or less incomplete until the end is reached,\r\n_rising intervals are the rule in intonation, and falling intervals the\r\nexception_, and it is this infrequency of use which gives to the falling\r\nmovement its value as a mode of emphasis. But where the emphasis is that\r\nof doubt, uncertainty, surprise, or interrogation, the suspensiveness of\r\nthese emotional states is appropriately expressed by rising intonations;\r\nand hence, too, in all sentences in which the interrogative element is\r\nstrongly present, the rising interval should characterize every syllable\r\nin it, and the sentences be uttered with interrogative intonations\r\nthroughout. If in any such sentence, a particular word is to be\r\nespecially emphasized, this is effected by giving to the word a low\r\nradical pitch and retaining the rising interval indicative of\r\ninterrogation.\r\n\r\n=The width of the interval= depends, as is natural, upon the intensity\r\nof the thought or emotion of which the concrete is intended to be an\r\nexpression. For example, suppose the statement, "=You= _are the\r\nculprit_," be answered by the surprised and indignant interrogation,\r\n"=I?=" The emphatic words here used may be appropriately uttered with\r\nintervals of a tone, a third, a fifth, or an octave, according to the\r\nemphasis supposed necessary.\r\n\r\n=The Semitone=, as has been said before, is an interval sometimes heard\r\nin language of distress, complaint, grief, sorrow, tenderness,\r\ncompassion, pity. Occasionally it is introduced in diatonic melody as an\r\nappropriate emphatic mode of uttering a single word; as, for example,\r\n"_Other friends have flown before; on the morrow_ HE _will leave me_."\r\nAt times diction may assume what may be called a _pathetic drift_, and\r\nfor the suitable interpretation of this drift semitonic intervals may be\r\nused, and the mode of progression cease for a space to be diatonic and\r\nbecome semitonic, or _chromatic_, as it is called.\r\n\r\n=The Wave= is one of the most impressive of the elements of expression;\r\nbut its proper use demands great flexibility in the vocal organs and a\r\nhigh degree of taste in the reader. Like all other unusual modes, its\r\nemployment lends color and contrast to utterance; that is, it makes it\r\nmore effective for the purposes of emphasis or distinction. The wave, as\r\nhas been described, is a concrete with an upward and a downward movement\r\nunited; but its last constituent is that which most affects the ear and\r\nleaves upon it the stronger impression, and hence, especially if it be\r\ngiven with a wide interval, _its dominant characteristic will be that of\r\nthe second movement_; for example, if the second movement be upward, the\r\nwave may express interrogation mingled with surprise or scorn; if the\r\nsecond movement be downward, the wave may express astonishment mingled\r\nwith indignation. The intervals which are given to the wave depend upon\r\nthe diction to which it is applied. To express great surprise or\r\nvehement indignation it may sweep through a fifth or a whole octave. In\r\nthese extreme modes _the wave frequently is given a wider interval in\r\nthe second movement than in the first_, and its effect intensified by\r\nthe appropriate use of stress, and (for the expression of such emotions\r\nas scorn, contempt, irony, ridicule, and so on) of the impure qualities\r\nof voice. When used with intervals of the second, the characteristics of\r\ndirect and inverted forms lose some of their distinctness; but in this\r\ndegree the wave is effectively used to put into relief occasional words,\r\nor, with median stress and long quantities, to give to the otherwise\r\nshort and tripping character of the second a dignified and impressive\r\neffect suited to the rendering of all serious and important diction that\r\nis not impassioned.\r\n\r\n=The Wave of the Semitone= is generally employed when time, or syllabic\r\nquantity, is needed as an element in the expression of the language of\r\ncomplaint or pathos. The effect is much the same whether it be direct or\r\nindirect.\r\n\r\n=The Tremor= may be used to express grief, supplication, tenderness, in\r\nwhich the interval through which it ranges may be wide, or, for a more\r\nplaintive effect, be limited to the semitone. With constituent intervals\r\nother than the semitone (that is, of a tone or otherwise), and ranging\r\nthrough an aggregate interval of less or greater width, it may be used\r\nto express laughter; as, for example, in the utterance of the syllables\r\n"_ha_, _ha_, _ha_, _ha_, _ha_," which, when rapidly effected, resembles\r\none syllable uttered with discrete intervals. Combined with stress,\r\naspiration, and guttural vibration, in suitable modifications, this\r\nlaughing tone may be made to express scorn, derision, exultation,\r\ntriumph, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. FORCE. Force must be considered under two aspects: first, as to the\r\n_degree of its intensity_ in the utterance of syllables, words, phrases,\r\nand sentences; and second, as to the _form of its application in the\r\nutterance of the concrete_. When the term is used without qualification,\r\nthe first of these considerations is intended; when the second is\r\nintended, force is generally spoken of as =stress=.\r\n\r\n_Force must be contradistinguished from loudness._ In mere loudness the\r\nvocal organs are comparatively relaxed--the intensity of sound being\r\nproduced by the violent discharge of a great volume of air from the\r\nlungs. In forceful utterance the vocal organs are compressed and tense,\r\nand though the volume of air effused be small, the resulting\r\nsound-vibrations are strong, and distinct, and of penetrating power.\r\n\r\nIn respect of intensity, force may be manifested in infinite variation,\r\nbut the degrees usually spoken of are _very light_, _light_,\r\n_moderate_, _strong_, and _very strong_. As with all other modes, these\r\ndegrees will vary from word to word, and from sentence to sentence; and\r\ngreat judgment and taste must be exercised in employing them, so that\r\nthey appropriately represent the intensity of the thought and feeling of\r\nwhich they are to be the expression.\r\n\r\n=Moderate Force= is the natural expression of tranquillity, and,\r\ntherefore, of all unimpassioned diction. As the diction becomes pervaded\r\nby the more positive emotions, the tones of the voice naturally become\r\nstronger. Certainty requires strong force with pure quality. So all the\r\npassions, the lighter as well as the more vehement, require the degree\r\nof force to be heightened: cheerfulness, joy, ecstacy, requiring force\r\nmoderately strong; and anger, hate, terror, revenge, being suitably\r\nrendered by very strong force. Again, doubt, uncertainty, secrecy, as\r\nwell as the gentler and more plaintive emotions, are most suitably\r\nrepresented by the lighter shades of force.\r\n\r\nAs the voice assumes the intenser modes of force, the vocal organs\r\nbecome more and more compressed, and utterance is more and more labored;\r\nthe breath forced out cannot all be vocalized; the voice becomes less\r\nand less pure, and manifests itself in the aspirate and guttural\r\nqualities. _Hence, strongly suppressed utterance in impure vocality,\r\nrather than mere loudness in pure vocality, is the appropriate\r\nexpression for all the intenser passions._\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. STRESS. Stress is force considered with respect of the form of its\r\napplication to the concrete. Since the equable concrete is the natural\r\ncolorless expression of unimpassioned thought, force applied to any part\r\nof it changes its character, and gives it a more or less significant\r\nemphasis. The three most usual forms of stress are the _radical_, the\r\n_median_, and the _final_; these may be effected in any of the degrees\r\nof force. _Compound stress_ and _thorough stress_ admit of but little\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\n=Radical Stress=, to some extent an essential, but not an expressive\r\nelement in the equable concrete, is, in a somewhat stronger form, an\r\nelement in all utterance that is intended to be vivid and energetic,\r\nemphasizing these characteristics by its own incisive clearness. The\r\nmore animated and energetic the diction the clearer and more determined\r\nshould be the opening of the concrete, that is, the more distinct and\r\nforcible should be its radical stress; while in graver language the\r\nradical stress is less pronounced. In its emphatic degree it ought at no\r\ntime to be allowed to become a current mode, imparting its peculiar\r\nincisive character to every syllable; though, for especial emphasis, it\r\nmay be appropriately used in this way in the utterance of the several\r\nwords of a phrase.\r\n\r\n=Final Stress= differs from radical stress principally in this, that\r\nwhile it equally indicates energy and positiveness, it does so as in\r\naccordance with predetermination and reflection. _Radical stress\r\ndenotes, as it were, an involuntary state of energy; final stress, the\r\nenergy or fixedness of resolve._ Hence, final stress is appropriate to\r\nthe expression of resolution, of obstinacy, of earnest conviction, of\r\npassionate resolve. It emphasizes the characteristics of wide intervals,\r\ngiving to rising intonations a more decidedly interrogatory character,\r\nand making falling intonations more vehemently and passionately\r\npositive.\r\n\r\n=Median Stress=, as it can be effectively applied to none but indefinite\r\nor mutable syllables, is compatible only with such a rate of utterance\r\nas will permit of these receiving long quantities. It may receive any\r\ndegree of force, from that gentle swell which indicates a tranquil flow\r\nof emotion, to that firm and swelling energy which is the appropriate\r\nexpression of the language of elevated feeling. With the wider intervals\r\nit should be used only for occasional emphasis; but in its lighter forms\r\nit may prevail as a drift of dignified expression. Median stress, being\r\nalways necessarily associated with long quantity in syllables, is not an\r\nappropriate mode in the language of colloquy, or in vivacious discourse\r\nof any kind. It is, however, the fit interpreter of that fervid and\r\nlofty imagination which clothes itself in forms of grace and grandeur;\r\nand hence, with intonations and waves of the lesser intervals, with\r\nmedium or low sentential pitch, a moderate degree of force, and the pure\r\nor orotund quality, it is the appropriate expression of all exalted\r\nprose and poetry, not strongly dramatic.\r\n\r\n=Thorough Stress= is effected by continuing the force and fulness of the\r\nradical stress throughout the whole concrete. Used as a current mode,\r\nwhich should be but rarely, it is expressive of bluntness, arrogance,\r\nbravado; and, with short quantities, of ignorant coarseness.\r\nOccasionally it may be used instead of final stress to give emphasis to\r\na syllable whose vanishing movement is but little capable of receiving\r\nan increase of force.\r\n\r\n=Compound Stress= combines the qualities of both radical and final\r\nstress; it is therefore of extreme character, and can be only\r\noccasionally used. With wide intervals, in its stronger modes, it is\r\nexpressive of the utmost intensity of feeling; in its lighter modes it\r\nis the natural expression of strong surprise.\r\n\r\n=The Loud Concrete= is simply the equable concrete uttered with greater\r\nfulness of breath and loudness of tone. It is used to break a current of\r\nlight force for the sake of emphasizing some word or phrase; and, in\r\nimpassioned discourse, it may be used as a current mode, individual\r\nwords or phrases being then put in relief by receiving the forcible\r\nradical, or thorough, or compound stress.\r\n\r\nIn reference to stress it must be remembered that, as with all other\r\nvarieties of emphatic utterance, no one form should prevail as an\r\nexclusive mode. Even a prevalent drift of thought or feeling will be\r\nmost effectively rendered by vocal signs which change in color and\r\nintensity from word to word. It must also be borne in mind in reference\r\nboth to force and stress, and to pitch and time as well, that the modes\r\nwhich are employed must sustain a suitable relation to the situation and\r\nsurroundings of the speaker. Where considerable space has to be filled\r\nand distance overcome, the energy of utterance should be correspondingly\r\nintense; but for great distances, what is called =level speaking= is the\r\nonly effectual mode,--that is, speaking exclusively in those tones of\r\nnormal pitch in which the voice has most penetrating power, with force\r\nof almost constant intensity, and in a somewhat slow movement with long\r\nsyllabic quantities, but of course with as much needful variation of\r\nexpression as is possible within these limits.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. TIME. Time is rate of utterance. It comprehends _quantity_, or rate\r\nconsidered in reference to the duration of individual syllables; and\r\n_movement_, or rate considered in reference to the utterance of\r\nsyllables and words in succession. With it may be considered _pauses_,\r\nor cessations of the voice, helpful in the expression of thought and\r\nfeeling, and necessary to the working of the vocal mechanism.\r\n\r\n=Quantity=, as defined above, is an arbitrary thing, dependent almost\r\nentirely upon the will of the speaker. But many words and syllables are\r\nmore expressive of their meaning when, in uttering them, the voice is\r\nsomewhat prolonged,--hence _quantity is an element of expression_.\r\nAgain, many words and syllables can receive this prolongation of\r\nutterance more readily than others,--hence _quantity is a natural\r\nelement of spoken language_. As indefinite syllables are much more\r\ncapable of prolongation than mutable or immutable syllables, they are\r\nsaid to possess long quantity, or, more shortly, "to possess quantity";\r\nmutable syllables possess quantity in a less degree, and immutable\r\nsyllables are naturally deficient in quantity.\r\n\r\nAs an element of expression, quantity (that is, long quantity) lends\r\ndignity and grace to the movement of the voice, and affords ground for\r\nthe display of those expressive modes of vocal action which are\r\nincompatible with the rapid or ejaculatory utterance of the concrete;\r\nand hence, with median stress, the wave, moderate intervals, medium or\r\nlow sentential pitch, it is used as naturally interpretative of\r\nsolemnity, reverence, awe, deep pathos, ardent admiration, and all\r\nelevated emotion. Colloquial tones, excited argument, wit, raillery, and\r\nall the lighter emotions, require for their expression, brilliancy\r\nrather than grace, and so are more fittingly interpreted by short\r\nquantities and radical stress.\r\n\r\nThe discerning reader, in his work of vocal interpretation, will not\r\nfail to take advantage of the inherent character of syllables with\r\nrespect to quantity. Our language abounds in indefinite syllables to\r\nwhich he may impart whatever quantity he may desire. On the other hand,\r\nimmutable syllables, while not admitting the wave and the median stress,\r\nare eminently fitted to receive the more forcible forms of radical\r\nstress; and mutable syllables, with their abrupt closes, permit of\r\nperfect exemplifications of thorough and final stress.\r\n\r\n=Movement=, though it depends for its slower and more expressive forms\r\nupon the capacities of syllables for the reception of long quantities,\r\nis, in its more rapid forms, quite independent of syllabic structure,\r\nand dependent only on the will of the speaker; hence it may be spoken of\r\nas being altogether under his control. A medium rate of utterance is,\r\nwith respect to time, the natural expression of an equable flow of\r\nthought. The livelier emotions should be indicated by quicker rates, and\r\nhence, cheerfulness, joy, vivacious dialogue, animated narration,\r\nnaturally find their expression in movements more or less brisk, with\r\nshort quantities, varied intonations, and pitch higher than the normal;\r\nthe more vehement emotions, eagerness, anger, excited anxiety, demand\r\nsimply heightened forms of these modes. Contrariwise, thought of grave\r\nand meditative character, admiration, reverence, and all the deeper and\r\ncalmer feelings, require a deliberative, slow-timed utterance, with long\r\nquantities for accented syllables, and extended time for even unaccented\r\nsyllables. As these serious emotions become stronger and deeper, the\r\nsyllabic quantities become proportionately longer, and with impressive\r\nmedian swells, orotund quality, low pitch, waves and simple intonations\r\nof the second, frequent phrases in monotone, and an occasional tremor,\r\nconstitute the most impressive utterance of adoration.\r\n\r\n_Occasionally an abrupt change in quantity, or movement, may be employed\r\nas a mode of emphasis_, either positive or negative; for example, in a\r\ncurrent of rapid movement, a word may be put into strong relief by being\r\nuttered with quantity much extended; contrariwise, a parenthetical or\r\nexplanatory phrase is usually touched upon lightly and with a more rapid\r\nmovement than that of the current in which it is found.\r\n\r\n=Pause= _may be used as an element in the expression of thought simply,\r\nthat is, as a help to the interpretation of the mere sense of the words\r\nread_; or, _more emphatically, as an element in the expression of\r\nfeeling and emotion_. As interpretative of thought, pauses should\r\ncorrespond mainly with the graphical marks of punctuation. Two things,\r\nhowever, must be borne in mind: _first_, the use of punctuation marks in\r\nwriting and in printing is always more or less an arbitrary matter,\r\nscarcely any two authors agreeing in their employment of them; and\r\ntherefore the reader\'s own good sense must be to him his principal\r\nauthority as to the closeness with which he follows them: and _second_,\r\npauses are to an auditor what punctuation marks are intended to be to a\r\nreader; but, whereas the eye may constantly keep within its vision the\r\nrelation of each word uttered, both to those which preceded it and to\r\nthose which are to follow, the ear hears the words that are read only\r\n_ictus_ by _ictus_, stroke by stroke, and therefore can not aid the mind\r\nto grasp this relation--the memory alone helping to do that; and hence,\r\nin reading, pauses should be more frequent, and perhaps more prolonged,\r\nthan the punctuation marks might seem to necessitate. The reader should\r\nalso bear in mind that even the plainest and simplest diction, or that\r\nrequiring the most rapid utterance, may be so marked by appropriate\r\npauses that those stoppages of the voice necessarily required for\r\ninspiration, shall never occur except when they assist to interpret the\r\nsense,--they must not interrupt it.\r\n\r\nAs interpretative of emotion pauses do not necessarily correspond to\r\ngrammatical structure; but, as with all the modes of expression\r\npreviously considered, their frequency and length--their only\r\nmodifications--must harmonize with the feeling which they are to assist\r\nin interpreting. In length, for example, they should correspond with the\r\nmovement of which they may be said to form a part; when the movement is\r\nslow, as in the expression of awe, reverence, and the like, they are\r\nnaturally long; in the brisk movement required to interpret the livelier\r\nemotions, they should be short. As a mode of emphasis pause serves to\r\nfix the attention of the hearer,--either _backward_ upon a word or\r\nphrase, that the mind may dwell upon it, or _forward_ to awaken\r\ncuriosity and expectation: it is evident then that a frequent use of it\r\nfor this purpose would destroy its value.\r\n\r\n_Pauses may be used in reading to simulate an appropriate labor of\r\nutterance_, as when the mind is supposed to be overcome by sorrow, or\r\ndisturbed by anger. At such times also, they serve as fit rests for the\r\nvoice in its efforts to express the disturbed condition of the mind, and\r\nas appropriate avenues for the escape of emotion otherwise than by\r\nvocality, as by sibling. _Pauses should be used also to indicate sudden\r\ntransitions from one state of caution to another._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE HIGH SCHOOL READER_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI. KING SOLOMON\'S PRAYER AND BLESSING AT THE DEDICATION OF THE TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n_From_ THE FIRST BOOK OF KINGS.\r\n\r\n_Translated 1611--Revised 1885._\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the\r\ntribes, the princes of the fathers\' houses of the children of Israel,\r\nunto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of\r\nthe LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. And all the men of\r\nIsrael assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month\r\nEthanim, which is the seventh month. And all the elders of Israel came,\r\nand the priests took up the ark. And they brought up the ark of the\r\nLORD, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the\r\nTent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up. And king\r\nSolomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto\r\nhim, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that\r\ncould not be told nor numbered for multitude. And the priests brought in\r\nthe ark of the covenant of the LORD unto its place, into the oracle of\r\nthe house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.\r\nFor the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and\r\nthe cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. There was\r\nnothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at\r\nHoreb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when\r\nthey came out of the land of Egypt. And it came to pass, when the\r\npriests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house\r\nof the LORD, so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason\r\nof the cloud: for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\nThen spake Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick\r\ndarkness. I have surely built thee an house of habitation, a place for\r\nthee to dwell in for ever. And the king turned his face about, and\r\nblessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of\r\nIsrael stood. And he said, Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, which\r\nspake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand\r\nfulfilled it, saying, Since the day that I brought forth my people\r\nIsrael out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to\r\nbuild an house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be\r\nover my people Israel. Now it was in the heart of David my father to\r\nbuild an house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. But the LORD\r\nsaid unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an\r\nhouse for my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart:\r\nnevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come\r\nforth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name. And the\r\nLORD hath established his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the\r\nroom of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD\r\npromised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of\r\nIsrael. And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the\r\ncovenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought\r\nthem out of the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\nAnd Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all\r\nthe congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:\r\nand he said, O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in\r\nheaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and mercy with\r\nthy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart: who hast kept\r\nwith thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea,\r\nthou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as\r\nit is this day. Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with thy\r\nservant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There\r\nshall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; if\r\nonly thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou hast\r\nwalked before me. Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray\r\nthee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.\r\nBut will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the\r\nheaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I\r\nhave builded! Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and\r\nto his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the\r\nprayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day: that thine eyes\r\nmay be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place\r\nwhereof thou hast said, My name shall be there: to hearken unto the\r\nprayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place. And hearken thou\r\nto the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they\r\nshall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling\r\nplace: and when thou hearest, forgive. If a man sin against his\r\nneighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he\r\ncome and swear before thine altar in this house: then hear thou in\r\nheaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring\r\nhis way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him\r\naccording to his righteousness. When thy people Israel be smitten down\r\nbefore the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; if they turn\r\nagain to thee, and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication unto\r\nthee in this house: then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy\r\npeople Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto\r\ntheir fathers. When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because\r\nthey have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and\r\nconfess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:\r\nthen hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of\r\nthy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they\r\nshould walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy\r\npeople for an inheritance. If there be in the land famine, if there be\r\npestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpiller; if\r\ntheir enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague,\r\nwhatsoever sickness there be; what prayer and supplication soever be\r\nmade by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man\r\nthe plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this\r\nhouse: then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do,\r\nand render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou\r\nknowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the\r\nchildren of men;) that they may fear thee all the days that they live\r\nin the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. Moreover concerning the\r\nstranger, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a\r\nfar country for thy name\'s sake; (for they shall hear of thy great name,\r\nand of thy mighty hand, and of thy stretched out arm:) when he shall\r\ncome and pray toward this house; hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place,\r\nand do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all\r\nthe peoples of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as doth thy\r\npeople Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built\r\nis called by thy name. If thy people go out to battle against their\r\nenemy, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto the\r\nLORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which\r\nI have built for thy name: then hear thou in heaven their prayer and\r\ntheir supplication, and maintain their cause. If they sin against thee,\r\n(for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and\r\ndeliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the\r\nland of the enemy, far off or near; yet if they shall bethink themselves\r\nin the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make\r\nsupplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive,\r\nsaying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt\r\nwickedly; if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all\r\ntheir soul in the land of their enemies, which carried them captive, and\r\npray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers,\r\nthe city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for\r\nthy name: then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven\r\nthy dwelling place, and maintain their cause; and forgive thy people\r\nwhich have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein\r\nthey have transgressed against thee; and give them compassion before\r\nthose who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:\r\nfor they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest\r\nforth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron: that thine\r\neyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the\r\nsupplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them whensoever\r\nthey cry unto thee. For thou didst separate them from among all the\r\npeoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by\r\nthe hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out\r\nof Egypt, O Lord GOD.\r\n\r\nAnd it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\r\nprayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of\r\nthe LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward\r\nheaven. And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a\r\nloud voice, saying, Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his\r\npeople Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed\r\none word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses\r\nhis servant. The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers:\r\nlet him not leave us, nor forsake us: that he may incline our hearts\r\nunto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his\r\nstatutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers. And let\r\nthese my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be\r\nnigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of\r\nhis servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall\r\nrequire: that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD, he is\r\nGod; there is none else. Let your heart therefore be perfect with the\r\nLORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as\r\nat this day. And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice\r\nbefore the LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. INVITATION.\r\n\r\n_From_ ISAIAH.\r\n\r\n_Translated 1611--Revised 1885._\r\n\r\n\r\nHo, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no\r\nmoney; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money\r\nand without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not\r\nbread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently\r\nunto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself\r\nin fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear and your soul shall\r\nlive: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure\r\nmercies of David....\r\n\r\nSeek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is\r\nnear: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his\r\nthoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon\r\nhim; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. For my thoughts are\r\nnot your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For as\r\nthe heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your\r\nways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down\r\nand the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the\r\nearth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to the sower\r\nand bread to the eater; so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my\r\nmouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that\r\nwhich I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. For\r\nye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and\r\nthe hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees\r\nof the field shall clap their hands. Instead of the thorn shall come up\r\nthe fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree:\r\nand it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that\r\nshall not be cut off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE TRIAL SCENE IN THE "MERCHANT OF VENICE."[A]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.--1564-1616.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scene_--A Court of Justice. _Present_--THE DUKE, the Magnificoes,\r\nANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SOLANIO, and others.\r\n\r\n_Duke._ What, is Antonio here?\r\n\r\n_Antonio._ Ready, so please your grace.\r\n\r\n_Duke._ I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer\r\nA stony adversary, an inhuman wretch\r\nUncapable of pity, void and empty\r\nFrom any dram of mercy.\r\n\r\n_Antonio._         I have heard\r\nYour grace hath ta\'en great pains to qualify\r\nHis rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,\r\nAnd that no lawful means can carry me\r\nOut of his envy\'s reach, I do oppose\r\nMy patience to his fury; and am arm\'d\r\nTo suffer, with a quietness of spirit,\r\nThe very tyranny and rage of his.\r\n\r\n_Duke._ Go one, and call the Jew into the court.\r\n\r\n_Solanio._ He\'s ready at the door: he comes, my lord.\r\n\r\n_Enter_ SHYLOCK.\r\n\r\n_Duke._ Make room, and let him stand before our face.--\r\nShylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,\r\nThat thou but lead\'st this fashion of thy malice\r\nTo the last hour of act; and then \'tis thought\r\nThou\'lt show thy mercy and remorse, more strange\r\nThan is thy strange apparent cruelty;\r\nAnd where thou now exact\'st the penalty,--\r\nWhich is a pound of this poor merchant\'s flesh,--\r\nThou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,\r\nBut, touch\'d with human gentleness and love,\r\nForgive a moiety of the principal;\r\nGlancing an eye of pity on his losses,\r\nThat have of late so huddled on his back,\r\nEnough to press a royal merchant down\r\nAnd pluck commiseration of his state\r\nFrom brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,\r\nFrom stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train\'d\r\nTo offices of tender courtesy.\r\nWe all expect a gentle answer, Jew.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ I have possess\'d your grace of what I purpose;\r\nAnd by our holy Sabbath have I sworn\r\nTo have the due and forfeit of my bond:\r\nIf you deny it, let the danger light\r\nUpon your charter and your city\'s freedom.\r\nYou\'ll ask me, why I rather choose to have\r\nA weight of carrion flesh than to receive\r\nThree thousand ducats; I\'ll not answer that;\r\nBut, say, it is my humor; is it answer\'d?\r\nWhat if my house be troubled with a rat,\r\nAnd I be pleas\'d to give ten thousand ducats\r\nTo have it ban\'d? What, are you answer\'d yet?\r\nSome men there are love not a gaping pig;\r\nSome, that are mad if they behold a cat;\r\nAnd others, when the bagpipe sings i\' the nose,\r\nCannot contain themselves: for affection,\r\nMaster of passion, sways it to the mood\r\nOf what it likes, or loathes. Now, for your answer:\r\nAs there is no firm reason to be render\'d,\r\nWhy he cannot abide a gaping pig;\r\nWhy he, a harmless necessary cat;\r\nWhy he, a woollen bagpipe,--but of force\r\nMust yield to such inevitable shame\r\nAs to offend, himself being offended;\r\nSo can I give no reason, nor I will not,\r\nMore than a lodg\'d hate and a certain loathing\r\nI bear Antonio, that I follow thus\r\nA losing suit against him. Are you answer\'d?\r\n\r\n_Bassanio._ This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,\r\nTo excuse the current of thy cruelty.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ I am not bound to please thee with my answer.\r\n\r\n_Bassanio._ Do all men kill the things they do not love?\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ Hates any man the thing he would not kill?\r\n\r\n_Bassanio._ Every offence is not a hate at first.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ What, would\'st thou have a serpent sting thee twice?\r\n\r\n_Antonio._ I pray you, think you question with the Jew.\r\nYou may as well go stand upon the beach,\r\nAnd bid the main flood bate his usual height;\r\nYou may as well use question with the wolf,\r\nWhy he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;\r\nYou may as well forbid the mountain pines\r\nTo wag their high tops, and to make no noise,\r\nWhen they are fretted with the gusts of heaven;\r\nYou may as well do anything most hard,\r\nAs seek to soften that--than which what\'s harder?--\r\nHis Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,\r\nMake no more offers, use no further means,\r\nBut, with all brief and plain conveniency,\r\nLet me have judgment, and the Jew his will.\r\n\r\n_Bassanio._ For thy three thousand ducats here is six.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ If every ducat in six thousand ducats\r\nWere in six parts, and every part a ducat,\r\nI would not draw them; I would have my bond.\r\n\r\n_Duke._ How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend\'ring none?\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?\r\nYou have among you many a purchas\'d slave,\r\nWhich, like your asses, and your dogs, and mules,\r\nYou use in abject and in slavish parts,\r\nBecause you bought them: shall I say to you,\r\nLet them be free, marry them to your heirs?\r\nWhy sweat they under burdens? let their beds\r\nBe made as soft as yours, and let their palates\r\nBe season\'d with such viands? You will answer,\r\n"The slaves are ours:" so do I answer you:\r\nThe pound of flesh, which I demand of him,\r\nIs dearly bought; \'tis mine, and I will have it:\r\nIf you deny me, fie upon your law!\r\nThere is no force in the decrees of Venice.\r\nI stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?\r\n\r\n_Duke._ Upon my power I may dismiss this court,\r\nUnless Bellario, a learn\xc3\xa8d doctor,\r\nWhom I have sent for to determine this,\r\nCome here to-day.\r\n\r\n_Solanio._        My lord, here stays without\r\nA messenger with letters from the doctor,\r\nNew come from Padua.\r\n\r\n_Duke._ Bring us the letters; call the messenger.\r\n\r\n_Bassanio._ Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!\r\nThe Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,\r\nEre thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.\r\n\r\n_Antonio._ I am a tainted wether of the flock,\r\nMeetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit\r\nDrops earliest to the ground, and so let me:\r\nYou cannot better be employ\'d, Bassanio,\r\nThan to live still, and write mine epitaph.\r\n\r\n_Enter_ NERISSA, _dressed like a lawyer\'s clerk._\r\n\r\n_Duke._ Came you from Padua, from Bellario?\r\n\r\n_Nerissa._ From both, my lord: Bellario greets your grace.\r\n\r\n[_Presents a letter._\r\n\r\n_Bassanio._ Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.\r\n\r\n_Gratiano._ Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,\r\nThou mak\'st thy knife keen; but no metal can,\r\nNo, not the hangman\'s axe, bear half the keenness\r\nOf thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.\r\n\r\n_Gratiano._ O, be thou damn\'d, inexorable dog!\r\nAnd for thy life let justice be accus\'d.\r\nThou almost mak\'st me waver in my faith,\r\nTo hold opinion with Pythagoras,\r\nThat souls of animals infuse themselves\r\nInto the trunks of men: thy currish spirit\r\nGovern\'d a wolf, who, hang\'d for human slaughter,\r\nEven from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,\r\nAnd, whilst thou lay\'st in thy unhallow\'d dam,\r\nInfus\'d itself in thee; for thy desires\r\nAre wolfish, bloody, starv\'d, and ravenous.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,\r\nThou but offend\'st thy lungs to speak so loud:\r\nRepair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall\r\nTo cureless ruin. I stand here for law.\r\n_Duke._ This letter from Bellario doth commend\r\nA young and learn\xc3\xa8d doctor to our court:--\r\nWhere is he?\r\n\r\n_Nerissa._ He attendeth here hard by,\r\nTo know your answer, whether you\'ll admit him.\r\n\r\n_Duke._ With all my heart.--Some three or four of you\r\nGo give him courteous conduct to this place.--\r\nMeantime the court shall hear Bellario\'s letter.\r\n\r\n[Clerk reads.] _Your grace shall understand, that, at the receipt of\r\nyour letter, I am very sick: but, in the instant that your messenger\r\ncame, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome; his name\r\nis Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the\r\nJew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o\'er many books together: he is\r\nfurnished with my opinion: which, bettered with his own learning, the\r\ngreatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes with him, at my\r\nimportunity, to fill up your grace\'s request in my stead. I beseech you,\r\nlet his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend\r\nestimation; for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave\r\nhim to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his\r\ncommendation._\r\n\r\n_Duke._ You hear the learned Bellario, what he writes:\r\nAnd here, I take it, is the doctor come.--\r\n\r\n_Enter_ PORTIA, _dressed like a doctor of laws._\r\n\r\nGive me your hand: came you from old Bellario?\r\n\r\n_Portia._ I did, my lord.\r\n\r\n_Duke._                   You are welcome; take your place.\r\nAre you acquainted with the difference\r\nThat holds this present question in the court?\r\n\r\n_Portia._ I am inform\xc3\xa8d, throughly of the cause.\r\nWhich is the merchant here, and which the Jew?\r\n\r\n_Duke._ Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Is your name Shylock?\r\n\r\n_Shylock._                      Shylock is my name.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;\r\nYet in such rule that the Venetian law\r\nCannot impugn you as you do proceed.--\r\nYou stand within his danger, do you not?      [_To_ ANTONIO.\r\n\r\n_Antonio._ Ay, so he says.\r\n\r\n_Portia._                  Do you confess the bond?\r\n\r\n_Antonio._ I do.\r\n\r\n_Portia._        Then must the Jew be merciful.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ The quality of mercy is not strain\'d;\r\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\r\nUpon the place beneath: it is twice bless\'d;\r\nIt blesseth him that gives, and him that takes:\r\n\'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes\r\nThe thron\xc3\xa8d monarch better than his crown;\r\nHis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\r\nThe attribute to awe and majesty,\r\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\r\nBut mercy is above this sceptred sway;\r\nIt is enthron\xc3\xa8d in the hearts of kings,\r\nIt is an attribute to God himself;\r\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest God\'s\r\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\r\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,--\r\nThat, in the course of justice, none of us\r\nShould see salvation: we do pray for mercy;\r\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\r\nThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\r\nTo mitigate the justice of thy plea;\r\nWhich if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\r\nMust needs give sentence \'gainst the merchant there.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,\r\nThe penalty and forfeit of my bond.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Is he not able to discharge the money?\r\n\r\n_Bassanio._ Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;\r\nYea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,\r\nI will be bound to pay it ten times o\'er,\r\nOn forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:\r\nIf this will not suffice, it must appear\r\nThat malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,\r\nWrest once the law to your authority:\r\nTo do a great right, do a little wrong;\r\nAnd curb this cruel devil of his will.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ It must not be; there is no power in Venice\r\nCan alter a decree establish\xc3\xa8d:\r\n\'Twill be recorded for a precedent;\r\nAnd many an error, by the same example,\r\nWill rush into the state. It cannot be.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!\r\nO wise young judge, how do I honour thee!\r\n\r\n_Portia._ I pray you, let me look upon the bond.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ Here \'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Shylock, there\'s thrice thy money offer\'d thee.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:\r\nShall I lay perjury upon my soul?\r\nNo, not for Venice.\r\n\r\n_Portia._           Why, this bond is forfeit;\r\nAnd lawfully by this the Jew may claim\r\nA pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\r\nNearest the merchant\'s heart.--Be merciful;\r\nTake thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ When it is paid according to the tenor.\r\nIt doth appear you are a worthy judge;\r\nYou know the law, your exposition\r\nHath been most sound: I charge you by the law,\r\nWhereof you are a well-deserving pillar,\r\nProceed to judgment. By my soul I swear\r\nThere is no power in the tongue of man\r\nTo alter me: I stay here on my bond.\r\n\r\n_Antonio._ Most heartily I do beseech the court\r\nTo give the judgment.\r\n\r\n_Portia._             Why, then, thus it is:\r\nYou must prepare your bosom for his knife;--\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ O noble judge! O excellent young man!\r\n\r\n_Portia._--For the intent and purpose of the law\r\nHath full relation to the penalty,\r\nWhich here appeareth due upon the bond.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ \'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!\r\nHow much more elder art thou than thy looks!\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Therefore, lay bare your bosom.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._                                Ay, his breast:\r\nSo says the bond:--doth it not, noble judge?--\r\n"Nearest his heart:" those are the very words.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ It is so. Are there balance here, to weigh\r\nThe flesh?\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ I have them ready.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,\r\nTo stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ Is it so nominated in the bond?\r\n\r\n_Portia._ It is not so express\'d; but what of that?\r\n\'Twere good you do so much for charity.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ I cannot find it; \'tis not in the bond.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Come, merchant, have you anything to say?\r\n\r\n_Antonio._ But little: I am arm\'d, and well prepar\'d.--\r\nGive me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!\r\nGrieve not that I am fallen to this for you;\r\nFor herein Fortune shows herself more kind\r\nThan is her custom: it is still her use\r\nTo let the wretched man outlive his wealth,\r\nTo view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow\r\nAn age of poverty; from which lingering penance\r\nOf such a misery doth she cut me off.\r\nCommend me to your honorable wife:\r\nTell her the process of Antonio\'s end;\r\nSay how I lov\'d you, speak me fair in death;\r\nAnd, when the tale is told, bid her be judge\r\nWhether Bassanio had not once a love.\r\nRepent not you that you shall lose your friend,\r\nAnd he repents not that he pays your debt;\r\nFor, if the Jew do cut but deep enough,\r\nI\'ll pay it instantly with all my heart.\r\n\r\n_Bassanio._ Antonio, I am married to a wife\r\nWhich is as dear to me as life itself;\r\nBut life itself, my wife, and all the world,\r\nAre not with me esteem\'d above thy life:\r\nI would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all\r\nHere to this devil, to deliver you.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Your wife would give you little thanks for that,\r\nIf she were by, to hear you make the offer.\r\n\r\n_Gratiano._ I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:\r\nI would she were in heaven, so she could\r\nEntreat some power to change this currish Jew.\r\n\r\n_Nerissa._ \'Tis well you offer it behind her back;\r\nThe wish would make else an unquiet house.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ [_Aside._] These be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter;\r\nWould any of the stock of B\xc3\xa1rrabas\r\nHad been her husband rather than a Christian!--\r\n[_To_ PORTIA.] We trifle time; I pray thee, pursue sentence.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ A pound of that same merchant\'s flesh is thine:\r\nThe court awards it, and the law doth give it.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ Most rightful judge!\r\n\r\n_Portia._ And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:\r\nThe law allows it, and the court awards it.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ Most learn\xc3\xa8d judge! A sentence!--Come, prepare.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Tarry a little; there is something else.\r\nThis bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;\r\nThe words expressly are "a pound of flesh":\r\nTake then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;\r\nBut, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed\r\nOne drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods\r\nAre, by the laws of Venice, confiscate\r\nUnto the state of Venice.\r\n\r\n_Gratiano._ O upright judge!--Mark, Jew:--O learn\xc3\xa8d judge!\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ Is that the law?\r\n\r\n_Portia._                   Thyself shalt see the act:\r\nFor, as thou urgest justice, be assur\'d\r\nThou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.\r\n\r\n_Gratiano._ O learn\xc3\xa8d judge!--Mark, Jew:--a learn\xc3\xa8d judge!\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ I take this offer, then: pay the bond thrice,\r\nAnd let the Christian go.\r\n\r\n_Bassanio._               Here is the money.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Soft!\r\nThe Jew shall have all justice;--soft! no haste:--\r\nHe shall have nothing but the penalty.\r\n\r\n_Gratiano._ O Jew! an upright judge, a learn\xc3\xa8d judge!\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh.\r\nShed thou no blood; nor cut thou less nor more\r\nBut just a pound of flesh: if thou tak\'st more\r\nOr less than a just pound,--be it but so much\r\nAs makes it light, or heavy, in the substance,\r\nOr the division of the twentieth part,\r\nOf one poor scruple; nay, if the scale do turn\r\nBut in the estimation of a hair,--\r\nThou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.\r\n\r\n_Gratiano._ A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!\r\nNow, infidel, I have thee on the hip.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ Give me my principal, and let me go.\r\n\r\n_Bassanio._ I have it ready for thee; here it is.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ He hath refus\'d it in the open court:\r\nHe shall have merely justice, and his bond.\r\n\r\n_Gratiano._ A Daniel, still say I; a second Daniel!--\r\nI thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ Shall I not have barely my principal?\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,\r\nTo be so taken at thy peril, Jew.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ Why, then the devil give him good of it!\r\nI\'ll stay no longer question.\r\n\r\n_Portia._                     Tarry, Jew:\r\nThe law hath yet another hold on you.\r\nIt is enacted in the laws of Venice,\r\nIf it be prov\'d against an alien\r\nThat by direct or indirect attempts\r\nHe seek the life of any citizen,\r\nThe party \'gainst the which he doth contrive\r\nShall seize one half his goods; the other half\r\nComes to the privy coffer of the state;\r\nAnd the offender\'s life lies in the mercy\r\nOf the duke only, \'gainst all other voice.\r\nIn which predicament, I say, thou stand\'st;\r\nFor it appears, by manifest proceeding,\r\nThat, indirectly, and directly too,\r\nThou hast contriv\'d against the very life\r\nOf the defendant; and thou hast incurr\'d\r\nThe danger formerly by me rehears\'d.\r\nDown, therefore, and beg mercy of the duke.\r\n\r\n_Gratiano._ Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:\r\nAnd yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,\r\nThou hast not left the value of a cord;\r\nTherefore, thou must be hang\'d at the state\'s charge.\r\n\r\n_Duke._ That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,\r\nI pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:\r\nFor half thy wealth, it is Antonio\'s;\r\nThe other half comes to the general state,\r\nWhich humbleness may drive unto a fine.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:\r\nYou take my house when you do take the prop\r\nThat doth sustain my house; you take my life,\r\nWhen you do take the means whereby I live.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ What mercy can you render him, Antonio?\r\n\r\n_Gratiano._ A halter gratis; nothing else, for God\'s sake.\r\n\r\n_Antonio._ So please my lord the duke, and all the court,\r\nTo quit the fine for one half of his goods,\r\nI am content, so he will let me have\r\nThe other half in use, to render it,\r\nUpon his death, unto the gentleman\r\nThat lately stole his daughter:\r\nTwo things provided more,--that, for this favor,\r\nHe presently become a Christian;\r\nThe other, that he do record a gift,\r\nHere in the court, of all he dies possess\'d,\r\nUnto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.\r\n\r\n_Duke._ He shall do this; or else I do recant\r\nThe pardon that I late pronounc\xc3\xa8d here.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ I am content.\r\n\r\n_Portia._                Clerk, draw a deed of gift.\r\n\r\n_Shylock._ I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;\r\nI am not well: send the deed after me,\r\nAnd I will sign it.\r\n\r\n_Duke._             Get thee gone, but do it.\r\n\r\n_Gratiano._ In christening thou shalt have two godfathers;\r\nHad I been judge, thou should\'st have had ten more,\r\nTo bring thee to the gallows, not the font.      [_Exit Shylock._\r\n\r\n_Duke._ Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.\r\n\r\n_Portia._ I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:\r\nI must away this night toward Padua,\r\nAnd it is meet I presently set forth.\r\n\r\n_Duke._ I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.\r\nAntonio, gratify this gentleman,\r\nFor, in my mind, you are much bound to him.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt omnes._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] As an introduction read "The Merchant of Venice," FOURTH READER,\r\npage 311.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. OF BOLDNESS.\r\n\r\nLORD BACON.--1561-1626.\r\n\r\n_From_ ESSAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a trivial grammar-school text, but yet worthy a wise man\'s\r\nconsideration: question was asked of Demosthenes, what was the chief\r\npart of an orator? He answered, action: what next? action: what next\r\nagain? action. He said it that knew it best, and had by nature himself\r\nno advantage in that he commended. A strange thing, that that part of an\r\norator which is but superficial, and rather the virtue of a player,\r\nshould be placed so high above those other noble parts, of invention,\r\nelocution, and the rest; nay, almost alone, as if it were all in all.\r\nBut the reason is plain. There is in human nature generally more of the\r\nfool than of the wise; and therefore those faculties by which the\r\nfoolish part of men\'s minds is taken, are most potent. Wonderful like is\r\nthe case of boldness in civil business; what first? boldness: what\r\nsecond and third? boldness. And yet boldness is a child of ignorance and\r\nbaseness, far inferior to other parts: but, nevertheless, it doth\r\nfascinate, and bind hand and foot those that are either shallow in\r\njudgment or weak in courage, which are the greatest part; yea, and\r\nprevaileth with wise men at weak times; therefore we see it hath done\r\nwonders in popular states, but with senates and princes less; and more,\r\never upon the first entrance of bold persons into action, than soon\r\nafter; for boldness is an ill keeper of promise. Surely, as there are\r\nmountebanks for the natural body, so are there mountebanks for the\r\npolitic body--men that undertake great cures, and perhaps have been\r\nlucky in two or three experiments, but want the grounds of science, and\r\ntherefore cannot hold out. Nay, you shall see a bold fellow many times\r\ndo Mahomet\'s miracle. Mahomet made the people believe that he would call\r\na hill to him, and from the top of it offer up his prayers for the\r\nobservers of his law. The people assembled: Mahomet called the hill to\r\ncome to him again and again; and when the hill stood still, he was never\r\na whit abashed, but said, "If the hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet\r\nwill go to the hill." So these men, when they have promised great\r\nmatters, and failed most shamefully, yet, if they have the perfection of\r\nboldness, they will but slight it over, and make a turn, and no more\r\nado. Certainly, to men of great judgment, bold persons are sport to\r\nbehold; nay, and to the vulgar also boldness hath somewhat of the\r\nridiculous: for, if absurdity be the subject of laughter, doubt you not\r\nbut great boldness is seldom without some absurdity; especially it is a\r\nsport to see when a bold fellow is out of countenance, for that puts his\r\nface into a most shrunken and wooden posture, as needs it must--for in\r\nbashfulness the spirits do a little go and come--but with bold men, upon\r\nlike occasion, they stand at a stay; like a stale at chess, where it is\r\nno mate, but yet the game cannot stir: but this last were fitter for a\r\nsatire than for a serious observation. This is well to be weighed, that\r\nboldness is ever blind, for it seeth not dangers and inconveniences:\r\ntherefore it is ill in counsel, good in execution; so that the right use\r\nof bold persons is, that they never command in chief, but be seconds,\r\nand under the direction of others; for in counsel it is good to see\r\ndangers, and in execution not to see them, except they be very great.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _He that cannot see well, let him go softly._\r\n\r\n        BACON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.

OF CONTENTEDNESS IN ALL ESTATES AND ACCIDENTS.\r\n\r\nJEREMY TAYLOR.--1613-1667.\r\n\r\n_From_ HOLY LIVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtues and discourses are, like friends, necessary in all fortunes; but\r\nthose are the best, which are friends in our sadnesses, and support us\r\nin our sorrows and sad accidents: and in this sense, no man that is\r\nvirtuous can be friendless; nor hath any man reason to complain of the\r\nDivine Providence, or accuse the public disorder of things, or in his\r\nown infelicity, since God hath appointed one remedy for all the evils in\r\nthe world, and that is a contented spirit: for this alone makes a man\r\npass through fire, and not be scorched; through seas, and not be\r\ndrowned; through hunger and nakedness, and want nothing. For since all\r\nthe evil in the world consists in the disagreeing between the object and\r\nthe appetite, as when a man hath what he desires not, or desires what he\r\nhath not, or desires amiss; he that composes his spirit to the present\r\naccident, hath variety of instances for his virtue, but none to trouble\r\nhim, because his desires enlarge not beyond his present fortune: and a\r\nwise man is placed in the variety of chances, like the nave or centre of\r\na wheel, in the midst of all the circumvolutions and changes of posture,\r\nwithout violence or change, save that it turns gently in compliance with\r\nits changed parts, and is indifferent which part is up, and which is\r\ndown; for there is some virtue or other to be exercised, whatever\r\nhappens, either patience or thanksgiving, love or fear, moderation or\r\nhumility, charity or contentedness, and they are every one of them\r\nequally in order to his great end and immortal felicity: and beauty is\r\nnot made by white or red, by black eyes and a round face, by a straight\r\nbody and a smooth skin; but by a proportion to the fancy. No rules can\r\nmake amiability; our minds and apprehensions make that: and so is our\r\nfelicity; and we may be reconciled to poverty and a low fortune, if we\r\nsuffer contentedness and the grace of God to make the proportions. For\r\nno man is poor that does not think himself so: but if, in a full\r\nfortune, with impatience he desires more, he proclaims his wants and his\r\nbeggarly condition. But because this grace of contentedness was the sum\r\nof all the old moral philosophy, and a great duty in Christianity, and\r\nof most universal use in the whole course of our lives, and the only\r\ninstrument to ease the burdens of the world and the enmities of sad\r\nchances, it will not be amiss to press it by the proper arguments by\r\nwhich God hath bound it upon our spirits; it being fastened by reason\r\nand religion, by duty and interest, by necessity and conveniency, by\r\nexample, and by the proposition of excellent rewards, no less than peace\r\nand felicity.\r\n\r\nContentedness in all estates is a duty of religion; it is the great\r\nreasonableness of complying with the Divine Providence, which governs\r\nall the world, and hath so ordered us in the administration of his great\r\nfamily. He were a strange fool that should be angry because dogs and\r\nsheep need no shoes, and yet himself is full of care to get some. God\r\nhath supplied those needs to them by natural provisions, and to thee by\r\nan artificial: for he hath given thee reason to learn a trade, or some\r\nmeans to make or buy them, so that it only differs in the manner of our\r\nprovision: and which had you rather want, shoes or reason? and my\r\npatron, that hath given me a farm, is freer to me than if he gives a\r\nloaf ready baked. But, however, all these gifts come from him, and\r\ntherefore it is fit he should dispense them as he pleases; and if we\r\nmurmur here, we may, at the next melancholy, be troubled that God did\r\nnot make us to be angels or stars. For if that which we are or have do\r\nnot content us, we may be troubled for every thing in the world which is\r\nbeside our being or our possessions.\r\n\r\nGod is the master of the scenes; we must not choose which part we shall\r\nact; it concerns us only to be careful that we do it well, always\r\nsaying, "If this please God, let it be as it is:" and we, who pray that\r\nGod\'s will may be done in earth as it is in heaven, must remember that\r\nthe angels do whatsoever is commanded them, and go wherever they are\r\nsent, and refuse no circumstances; and if their employment be crossed by\r\na higher decree, they sit down in peace, and rejoice in the event; and\r\nwhen the angel of Judea could not prevail in behalf of the people\r\ncommitted to his charge, because the angel of Persia opposed it, he only\r\ntold the story at the command of God, and was as content, and worshipped\r\nwith as great an ecstasy in his proportion, as the prevailing spirit. Do\r\nthou so likewise: keep the station where God hath placed you, and you\r\nshall never long for things without, but sit at home, feasting upon the\r\nDivine Providence and thy own reason, by which we are taught that it is\r\nnecessary and reasonable to submit to God.\r\n\r\nFor is not all the world God\'s family? Are not we his creatures? Are we\r\nnot as clay in the hand of the potter? Do we not live upon his meat, and\r\nmove by his strength, and do our work by his light? Are we any thing but\r\nwhat we are from him? And shall there be a mutiny among the flocks and\r\nherds, because their lord or their shepherd chooses their pastures, and\r\nsuffers them not to wander into deserts and unknown ways? If we choose,\r\nwe do it so foolishly that we cannot like it long, and most commonly not\r\nat all: but God, who can do what he pleases, is wise to choose safely\r\nfor us, affectionate to comply with our needs, and powerful to execute\r\nall his wise decrees. Here, therefore, is the wisdom of the contented\r\nman, to let God choose for him; for when we have given up our wills to\r\nhim, and stand in that station of the battle where our great General\r\nhath placed us, our spirits must needs rest while our conditions have\r\nfor their security the power, the wisdom, and the charity of God.\r\n\r\nContentedness in all accidents brings great peace of spirit, and is the\r\ngreat and only instrument of temporal felicity. It removes the sting\r\nfrom the accident, and makes a man not to depend upon chance and the\r\nuncertain dispositions of men for his well-being, but only on God and\r\nhis own spirit. We ourselves make our fortunes good or bad; and when God\r\nlets loose a tyrant upon us, or a sickness, or scorn, or a lessened\r\nfortune, if we fear to die, or know not to be patient, or are proud or\r\ncovetous, then the calamity sits heavy on us. But if we know how to\r\nmanage a noble principle, and fear not death so much as a dishonest\r\naction, and think impatience a worse evil than a fever, and pride to be\r\nthe biggest disgrace, and poverty to be infinitely desirable before the\r\ntorments of covetousness; then we who now think vice to be so easy, and\r\nmake it so familiar, and think the cure so impossible, shall quickly be\r\nof another mind, and reckon these accidents amongst things eligible.\r\n\r\nBut no man can be happy that hath great hopes and great fears of things\r\nwithout, and events depending upon other men, or upon the chances of\r\nfortune. The rewards of virtue are certain, and our provisions for our\r\nnatural support are certain; or if we want meat till we die, then we die\r\nof that disease--and there are many worse than to die with an atrophy or\r\nconsumption, or unapt and coarser nourishment. But he that suffers a\r\ntransporting passion concerning things within the power of others, is\r\nfree from sorrow and amazement no longer than his enemy shall give him\r\nleave; and it is ten to one but he shall be smitten then and there where\r\nit shall most trouble him; for so the adder teaches us where to strike,\r\nby her curious and fearful defending of her head. The old Stoics, when\r\nyou told them of a sad story, would still answer, "_What is that to\r\nme?_" Yes, for the tyrant hath sentenced you also to prison. Well, what\r\nis that? He will put a chain upon my leg; but he cannot bind my soul.\r\nNo; but he will kill you. Then I will die. If presently, let me go, that\r\nI may presently be freer than himself: but if not till anon, or\r\nto-morrow, I will dine first, or sleep, or do what reason or nature\r\ncalls for, as at other times. This, in Gentile philosophy, is the same\r\nwith the discourse of St. Paul, "I have learned, in whatsoever state I\r\nam, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know\r\nhow to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed, both to be\r\nfull and to be hungry; both to abound and suffer need."\r\n\r\nWe are in the world like men playing at tables; the chance is not in our\r\npower, but to play it is; and when it is fallen we must manage it as we\r\ncan: and let nothing trouble us, but when we do a base action, or speak\r\nlike a fool, or think wickedly,--these things God hath put into our\r\npowers; but concerning those things which are wholly in the choice of\r\nanother, they cannot fall under our deliberation, and therefore neither\r\nare they fit for our passions. My fear may make me miserable, but it\r\ncannot prevent what another hath in his power and purpose; and\r\nprosperities can only be enjoyed by them who fear not at all to lose\r\nthem; since the amazement and passion concerning the future takes off\r\nall the pleasure of the present possession. Therefore, if thou hast lost\r\nthy land, do not also lose thy constancy; and if thou must die a little\r\nsooner, yet do not die impatiently. For no chance is evil to him that is\r\ncontent: and to a man nothing is miserable unless it be unreasonable. No\r\nman can make another man to be his slave unless he hath first enslaved\r\nhimself to life and death, to pleasure or pain, to hope or fear: command\r\nthese passions, and you are freer than the Parthian kings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. TO LUCASTA, ON GOING TO THE WARS.\r\n\r\nRICHARD LOVELACE.--1618-1658.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tell me not, sweet, I am unkind,\r\n      That from the nunnery\r\n    Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind,\r\n      To war and arms I fly.\r\n\r\n    True, a new mistress now I chase,\r\n      The first foe in the field;\r\n    And with a stronger faith embrace\r\n      A sword, a horse, a shield.\r\n\r\n    Yet this inconstancy is such\r\n      As you, too, shall adore,--\r\n    I could not love thee, dear, so much,\r\n      Lov\'d I not honor more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. ANGLING.\r\n\r\nIZAAK WALTON.--1593-1683.\r\n\r\n_From_ THE COMPLETE ANGLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Venator._--O my good master, this morning walk has been spent to my\r\ngreat pleasure and wonder; but I pray, when shall I have your direction\r\nhow to make artificial flies, like to those that the trout loves best,\r\nand also how to use them?\r\n\r\n_Piscator._--My honest scholar, it is now past five of the clock; we\r\nwill fish till nine, and then go to breakfast. Go you to yon\r\nsycamore-tree, and hide your bottle of drink under the hollow root of\r\nit; for about that time, and in that place, we will make a brave\r\nbreakfast with a piece of powdered beef, and a radish or two, that I\r\nhave in my fish-bag: we shall, I warrant you, make a good, honest,\r\nwholesome, hungry breakfast, and I will then give you direction for the\r\nmaking and using of your flies; and in the meantime, there is your rod\r\nand line, and my advice is, that you fish as you see me do, and let\'s\r\ntry which can catch the first fish.\r\n\r\n_Venator._--I thank you, master; I will observe and practise your\r\ndirection as far as I am able.\r\n\r\n_Piscator._--Look you, scholar, you see I have hold of a good fish: I\r\nnow see it is a trout. I pray put that net under him, and touch not my\r\nline, for if you do, then we break all. Well done, scholar! I thank you.\r\n\r\nNow for another. Trust me, I have another bite: come, scholar, come, lay\r\ndown your rod, and help me to land this as you did the other. So now we\r\nshall be sure to have a good dish for supper.\r\n\r\n_Venator._--I am glad of that; but I have no fortune: sure, master,\r\nyours is a better rod and better tackling.\r\n\r\n_Piscator._--Nay, then, take mine; and I will fish with yours. Look you,\r\nscholar, I have another. Come, do as you did before. And now I have a\r\nbite at another. Oh me! he has broke all: there\'s half a line and a good\r\nhook lost.\r\n\r\n_Venator._--Ay, and a good trout too.\r\n\r\n_Piscator._--Nay, the trout is not lost; for pray take notice, no man\r\ncan lose what he never had.\r\n\r\n_Venator._--Master, I can neither catch with the first nor second angle:\r\nI have no fortune.\r\n\r\n_Piscator._--Look you, scholar, I have yet another. And now, having\r\ncaught two brace of trouts, I will tell you a short tale as we walk\r\ntowards our breakfast. A scholar, a preacher I should say, that was to\r\npreach to procure the approbation of a parish that he might be their\r\nlecturer, had got from his fellow-pupil the copy of a sermon that was\r\nfirst preached with great commendation by him that composed it; and\r\nthough the borrower of it preached it, word for word, as it was at\r\nfirst, yet it was utterly disliked as it was preached by the second to\r\nhis congregation; which the sermon borrower complained of to the lender\r\nof it; and thus was answered: "I lent you, indeed, my fiddle, but not my\r\nfiddle-stick; for you are to know, that every one cannot make music with\r\nmy words, which are fitted to my own mouth." And so, my scholar, you are\r\nto know, that as the ill pronunciation or ill accenting of words in a\r\nsermon spoils it, so the ill carriage of your line, or not fishing even\r\nto a foot in a right place, makes you lose your labor; and you are to\r\nknow, that though you have my fiddle, that is, my very rod and tacklings\r\nwith which you see I catch fish, yet you have not my fiddle-stick, that\r\nis, you yet have not skill to know how to carry your hand and line, nor\r\nhow to guide it to a right place; and this must be taught you; for you\r\nare to remember, I told you angling is an art, either by practice or a\r\nlong observation, or both. But take this for a rule: when you fish for a\r\ntrout with a worm, let your line have so much and not more lead than\r\nwill fit the stream in which you fish; that is to say, more in a great\r\ntroublesome stream than in a smaller that is quieter; as near as may be,\r\nso much as will sink the bait to the bottom, and keep it still in\r\nmotion, and not more.\r\n\r\nBut now let\'s say grace and fall to breakfast. What say you, scholar, to\r\nthe providence of an old angler? does not this meat taste well? and was\r\nnot this place well chosen to eat it? for this sycamore-tree will shade\r\nus from the sun\'s heat.\r\n\r\n_Venator._--All excellent good, and my stomach excellent good too. And\r\nnow I remember and find that true which devout Lessius says: "That poor\r\nmen, and those that fast often, have much more pleasure in eating than\r\nrich men and gluttons, that always feed before their stomachs are empty\r\nof their last meal, and call for more; for by that means they rob\r\nthemselves of that pleasure that hunger brings to poor men." And I do\r\nseriously approve of that saying of yours, "that you would rather be a\r\ncivil, well-governed, well-grounded, temperate, poor angler, than a\r\ndrunken lord." But I hope there is none such: however, I am certain of\r\nthis, that I have been at many very costly dinners that have not\r\nafforded me half the content that this has done, for which I thank God\r\nand you.\r\n\r\nAnd now, good master, proceed to your promised direction for making and\r\nordering my artificial fly.\r\n\r\n_Piscator_.--My honest scholar, I will do it; for it is a debt due unto\r\nyou by my promise....\r\n\r\n... Look how it begins to rain!--and by the clouds, if I mistake not, we\r\nshall presently have a smoking shower, and therefore sit close: this\r\nsycamore-tree will shelter us; and I will tell you, as they shall come\r\ninto my mind, more observations of fly-fishing for a trout....\r\n\r\n... And now, scholar, my direction for fly-fishing is ended with this\r\nshower, for it has done raining: and now look about you, and see how\r\npleasantly that meadow looks; nay, and the earth smells as sweetly too.\r\nCome, let me tell you what holy Mr. Herbert says of such days and\r\nflowers as these; and then we will thank God that we enjoy them, and\r\nwalk to the river and sit down quietly, and try to catch the other brace\r\nof trouts.\r\n\r\n    Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,\r\n    The bridal of the earth and sky:\r\n    The dew shall weep thy fall to-night;\r\n                          For thou must die.\r\n\r\n    Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave,\r\n    Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye,\r\n    Thy root is ever in its grave;\r\n                          And thou must die.\r\n\r\n    Sweet Spring, full of sweet days and roses,\r\n    A box where sweets compacted lie;\r\n    Thy music shows ye have your closes;\r\n                          And all must die.\r\n\r\n    Only a sweet and virtuous soul,\r\n    Like season\'d timber, never gives;\r\n    But, though the whole world turn to coal,\r\n                          Then chiefly lives.\r\n\r\n_Venator._--I thank you, good master, for your good direction for\r\nfly-fishing, and for the sweet enjoyment of the pleasant day, which is\r\nso far spent without offence to God or man; and I thank you for the\r\nsweet close of your discourse with Mr. Herbert\'s verses, who, I have\r\nheard, loved angling; and I do the rather believe it, because he had a\r\nspirit suitable to anglers, and to those primitive Christians that you\r\nlove and have so much commended.\r\n\r\n_Piscator._--Well, my loving scholar, and I am pleased to know that you\r\nare so well pleased with my direction and discourse.... And now, I think\r\nit will be time to repair to our angle-rods, which we left in the water\r\nto fish for themselves: and you shall choose which shall be yours; and\r\nit is an even lay, one of them catches.\r\n\r\nAnd, let me tell you, this kind of fishing with a dead rod, and laying\r\nnight-hooks, are like putting money to use; for they both work for the\r\nowners, when they do nothing but sleep, or eat, or rejoice; as you know\r\nwe have done this last hour, and sat as quietly, and as free from cares\r\nunder this sycamore, as Virgil\'s Tityrus and his Meliboeus did, under\r\ntheir broad beech tree. No life, my honest scholar, no life so happy and\r\nso pleasant, as the life of a well-governed angler; for when the lawyer\r\nis swallowed up with business, and the statesman is preventing or\r\ncontriving plots, then we sit on cowslip banks, hear the birds sing, and\r\npossess ourselves in as much quietness as these silent silver streams,\r\nwhich we now see glide so quietly by us. Indeed, my good scholar, we may\r\nsay of angling as Dr. Boteler said of strawberries, "Doubtless, God\r\ncould have made a better berry, but doubtless, God never did;" and so,\r\nif I might be judge, "God never did make a more calm, quiet, innocent\r\nrecreation than angling."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. ON THE MORNING OF CHRIST\'S NATIVITY.\r\n\r\n(1629).\r\n\r\nJOHN MILTON.--1608-1674.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n    This is the month, and this the happy morn,\r\n    Wherein the Son of Heaven\'s Eternal King,\r\n    Of wedded maid and virgin mother born,\r\n    Our great redemption from above did bring;\r\n    For so the holy sages once did sing,\r\n      That he our deadly forfeit should release,\r\n    And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n    That glorious form, that light unsufferable,\r\n    And that far-beaming blaze of majesty,\r\n    Wherewith he wont at Heaven\'s high council-table\r\n    To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,\r\n    He laid aside; and, here with us to be,\r\n      Forsook the courts of everlasting day,\r\n    And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n    Say, Heavenly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein\r\n    Afford a present to the Infant God?\r\n    Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain,\r\n    To welcome him to this his new abode,\r\n    Now while the heaven, by the Sun\'s team untrod,\r\n      Hath took no print of the approaching light,\r\n    And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright?\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n    See how from far upon the eastern road\r\n    The star-led wizards haste with odors sweet!\r\n    O run, prevent them with thy humble ode,\r\n    And lay it lowly at his bless\xc3\xa8d feet;\r\n    Have thou the honor first thy Lord to greet,\r\n      And join thy voice unto the Angel Choir,\r\n    From out his secret altar touch\'d with hallow\'d fire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HYMN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n    It was the winter wild,\r\n    While the Heaven-born child,\r\n      All meanly wrapt, in the rude manger lies;\r\n    Nature, in awe to him,\r\n    Had doff\'d her gaudy trim,\r\n      With her great Master so to sympathize:\r\n    It was no season then for her\r\n    To wanton with the Sun, her lusty paramour.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n    Only, with speeches fair,\r\n    She woos the gentle Air\r\n      To hide her guilty front with innocent snow,\r\n    And on her naked shame,\r\n    Pollute with sinful blame,\r\n      The saintly veil of maiden white to throw;\r\n    Confounded, that her Maker\'s eyes\r\n    Should look so near upon her foul deformities.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n    But he, her fears to cease,\r\n    Sent down the meek-ey\'d Peace:\r\n      She, crown\'d with olive green, came softly sliding\r\n    Down through the turning sphere,\r\n    His ready harbinger,\r\n      With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing;\r\n    And, waving wide her myrtle wand,\r\n    She strikes a universal peace through sea and land.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n    No war, or battle\'s sound,\r\n    Was heard the world around:\r\n      The idle spear and shield were high up hung;\r\n    The hook\xc3\xa8d chariot stood,\r\n    Unstain\'d with hostile blood;\r\n      The trumpet spake not to the arm\xc3\xa8d throng;\r\n    And kings sat still with awful eye,\r\n    As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n    But peaceful was the night\r\n    Wherein the Prince of Light\r\n      His reign of peace upon the earth began:\r\n    The winds, with wonder whist,\r\n    Smoothly the waters kiss\'d,\r\n      Whispering new joys to the mild Ocean,\r\n    Who now hath quite forgot to rave,\r\n    While birds of calm sit brooding on the charm\xc3\xa8d wave.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\n    The stars, with deep amaze,\r\n    Stand fix\'d in steadfast gaze,\r\n      Bending one way their precious influence;\r\n    And will not take their flight,\r\n    For all the morning light,\r\n      Or Lucifer that often warn\'d them thence;\r\n    But in their glimmering orbs did glow,\r\n    Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\n    And, though the shady gloom\r\n    Had given day her room,\r\n    The Sun himself withheld his wonted speed;\r\n      And hid his head for shame,\r\n    As his inferior flame\r\n      The new-enlighten\'d world no more should need;\r\n    He saw a greater Sun appear\r\n    Than his bright throne or burning axletree could bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\n    The shepherds on the lawn,\r\n    Or ere the point of dawn,\r\n      Sat simply chatting in a rustic row;\r\n    Full little thought they then\r\n    That the mighty Pan\r\n      Was kindly come to live with them below:\r\n    Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,\r\n    Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\n    When such music sweet\r\n    Their hearts and ears did greet,\r\n      As never was by mortal finger strook,\r\n    Divinely-warbled voice\r\n    Answering the string\xc3\xa8d noise,\r\n      As all their souls in blissful rapture took:\r\n    The Air, such pleasure loth to lose,\r\n    With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\n    Nature, that heard such sound\r\n    Beneath the hollow round\r\n      Of Cynthia\'s seat, the Airy region thrilling,\r\n    Now was almost won\r\n    To think her part was done,\r\n      And that her reign had here its last fulfilling:\r\n    She knew such harmony alone\r\n    Could hold all Heaven and Earth in happier union.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.\r\n\r\n    At last surrounds their sight\r\n    A globe of circular light,\r\n      That with long beams the shame-faced Night array\'d;\r\n    The helm\xc3\xa8d cherubim,\r\n    And sword\xc3\xa8d seraphim,\r\n      Are seen in glittering ranks with wings display\'d,\r\n    Harping in loud and solemn choir,\r\n    With unexpressive notes to Heaven\'s new-born Heir.\r\n\r\n\r\n12.\r\n\r\n    Such music (as \'tis said)\r\n    Before was never made,\r\n      But when of old the Sons of Morning sung,\r\n    While the Creator great\r\n    His constellations set,\r\n      And the well-balanced world on hinges hung,\r\n    And cast the dark foundations deep,\r\n    And bid the welt\'ring waves their oozy channel keep.\r\n\r\n\r\n13.\r\n\r\n    Ring out, ye crystal spheres!\r\n    Once bless our human ears,\r\n      (If ye have power to touch our senses so,)\r\n    And let your silver chime\r\n    Move in melodious time;\r\n      And let the bass of Heaven\'s deep organ blow;\r\n    And with your ninefold harmony\r\n    Make up full consort to the angelic symphony.\r\n\r\n\r\n14.\r\n\r\n    For, if such holy song\r\n    Enwrap our fancy long,\r\n      Time will run back, and fetch the Age of Gold;\r\n    And speckled Vanity\r\n    Will sicken soon and die;\r\n      And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould;\r\n    And Hell itself will pass away,\r\n    And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.\r\n\r\n\r\n15.\r\n\r\n    Yea, Truth and Justice then\r\n    Will down return to men,\r\n      Orb\'d in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing,\r\n    Mercy will sit between,\r\n    Thron\'d in celestial sheen,\r\n      With radiant feet the tissu\'d clouds down steering;\r\n    And Heaven, as at some festival,\r\n    Will open wide the gates of her high palace-hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n16.\r\n\r\n    But wisest Fate says, No,\r\n    This must not yet be so;\r\n      The Babe yet lies in smiling infancy,\r\n    That on the bitter cross\r\n    Must redeem our loss;\r\n      So both himself and us to glorify:\r\n    Yet first, to those ychain\'d in sleep,\r\n    The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n17.\r\n\r\n    With such a horrid clang\r\n    As on Mount Sinai rang,\r\n      While the red fire and smould\'ring clouds out brake:\r\n    The aged Earth, aghast,\r\n    With terror of that blast,\r\n      Shall from the surface to the centre shake;\r\n    When, at the world\'s last session,\r\n    The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread his throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n18.\r\n\r\n    And then at last our bliss\r\n    Full and perfect is,\r\n      But now begins; for from this happy day\r\n    The Old Dragon under ground,\r\n    In straiter limits bound,\r\n      Not half so far casts his usurp\xc3\xa8d sway;\r\n    And, wroth to see his kingdom fail,\r\n    Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n19.\r\n\r\n    The Oracles are dumb;\r\n    No voice or hideous hum\r\n      Runs through the arch\xc3\xa8d roof in words deceiving.\r\n    Apollo from his shrine\r\n    Can no more divine,\r\n      With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.\r\n    No nightly trance, or breath\xc3\xa8d spell,\r\n    Inspires the pale-ey\'d priest from the prophetic cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n20.\r\n\r\n    The lonely mountains o\'er,\r\n    And the resounding shore,\r\n      A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament;\r\n    From haunted spring, and dale\r\n    Edg\'d with poplar pale,\r\n      The parting Genius is with sighing sent;\r\n    With flower-inwoven tresses torn\r\n    The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n21.\r\n\r\n    In consecrated earth,\r\n    And on the holy hearth,\r\n      The Lars, and Lemures, moan with midnight plaint;\r\n    In urns, and altars round,\r\n    A drear and dying sound\r\n      Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint;\r\n    And the chill marble seems to sweat,\r\n    While each peculiar Power forgoes his wonted seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n22.\r\n\r\n    Peor, and Ba\xc3\xa4lim,\r\n    Forsake their temples dim,\r\n      With that twice-batter\'d God of Palestine;\r\n    And moon\xc3\xa8d Ashtaroth,\r\n    Heaven\'s queen and mother both,\r\n      Now sits not girt with tapers\' holy shine:\r\n    The Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn;\r\n    In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n23.\r\n\r\n    And sullen Moloch, fled,\r\n    Hath left in shadows dread,\r\n      His burning idol all of blackest hue\r\n    In vain with cymbals\' ring\r\n    They call the grisly king,\r\n      In dismal dance about the furnace blue;\r\n    The brutish gods of Nile as fast,\r\n    Isis, and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste.\r\n\r\n\r\n24.\r\n\r\n    Nor is Osiris seen\r\n    In Memphian grove or green,\r\n      Trampling the unshower\'d grass with lowings loud;\r\n    Nor can he be at rest\r\n    Within his sacred chest;\r\n      Naught but profoundest Hell can be his shroud;\r\n    In vain, with timbrell\'d anthems dark,\r\n    The sable-stol\xc3\xa8d sorcerers bear his worshipp\'d ark.\r\n\r\n\r\n25.\r\n\r\n    He feels from Juda\'s land\r\n    The dreaded Infant\'s hand;\r\n      The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;\r\n    Nor all the gods beside\r\n    Longer dare abide,\r\n      Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:\r\n    Our Babe, to show his Godhead true,\r\n    Can in his swaddling bands control the damn\xc3\xa8d crew.\r\n\r\n\r\n26.\r\n\r\n    So, when the sun in bed,\r\n    Curtain\'d with cloudy red,\r\n      Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,\r\n    The flocking shadows pale\r\n    Troop to the infernal jail,\r\n      Each fetter\'d ghost slips to his several grave;\r\n    And the yellow-skirted fays\r\n    Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-lov\'d maze.\r\n\r\n\r\n27.\r\n\r\n    But see! the Virgin blest\r\n    Hath laid her Babe to rest.\r\n      Time is our tedious song should here have ending:\r\n    Heaven\'s youngest-teem\xc3\xa8d star,\r\n    Hath fix\'d her polish\'d car,\r\n      Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending;\r\n    And all about the courtly stable\r\n    Bright-harness\'d Angels sit in order serviceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. CHARACTER OF LORD FALKLAND.\r\n\r\nLORD CLARENDON.--1608-1674.\r\n\r\n_From_ HISTORY OF THE REBELLION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this unhappy battle [of Newbury] was slain the Lord Viscount\r\nFalkland; a person of such prodigious parts of learning and knowledge,\r\nof that inimitable sweetness and delight in conversation, of so flowing\r\nand obliging a humanity and goodness to mankind, and of that primitive\r\nsimplicity and integrity of life, that if there were no other brand upon\r\nthis odious and accursed civil war, than that single loss, it must be\r\nmost infamous, and execrable to all posterity.\r\n\r\nBefore this parliament, his condition of life was so happy that it was\r\nhardly capable of improvement. Before he came to be twenty years of age,\r\nhe was master of a noble fortune, which descended to him by the gift of\r\na grandfather, without passing through his father or mother, who were\r\nthen both alive, and not well enough contented to find themselves passed\r\nby in the descent. His education for some years had been in Ireland,\r\nwhere his father was lord-deputy; so that, when he returned into\r\nEngland, to the possession of his fortune, he was unentangled with any\r\nacquaintance or friends, which usually grow up by the custom of\r\nconversation; and therefore was to make a pure election of his company;\r\nwhich he chose by other rules than were prescribed to the young nobility\r\nof that time. And it cannot be denied, though he admitted some few to\r\nhis friendship for the agreeableness of their natures, and their\r\nundoubted affection to him, that his familiarity and friendship, for the\r\nmost part, was with men of the most eminent and sublime parts, and of\r\nuntouched reputation in point of integrity; and such men had a title to\r\nhis bosom.\r\n\r\nHe was a great cherisher of wit, and fancy, and good parts in any man;\r\nand, if he found them clouded with poverty or want, a most liberal and\r\nbountiful patron towards them, even above his fortune; of which, in\r\nthose administrations, he was such a dispenser, as, if he had been\r\ntrusted with it to such uses, and if there had been the least of vice in\r\nhis expense, he might have been thought too prodigal. He was constant\r\nand pertinacious in whatsoever he resolved to do, and not to be wearied\r\nby any pains that were necessary to that end. And, therefore, having\r\nonce resolved not to see London, which he loved above all places, till\r\nhe had perfectly learned the Greek tongue, he went to his own house in\r\nthe country, and pursued it with that indefatigable industry, that it\r\nwill not be believed in how short a time he was master of it, and\r\naccurately read all the Greek historians.\r\n\r\nIn this time, his house being within little more than ten miles of\r\nOxford, he contracted familiarity and friendship with the most polite\r\nand accurate men of that university; who found such an immenseness of\r\nwit, and such a solidity of judgment in him, so infinite a fancy, bound\r\nin by a most logical ratiocination, such a vast knowledge, that he was\r\nnot ignorant in anything, yet such an excessive humility, as if he had\r\nknown nothing, that they frequently resorted and dwelt with him, as in a\r\ncollege situated in a purer air; so that his house was a university in a\r\nless volume; whither they came not so much for repose as study; and to\r\nexamine and refine those grosser propositions, which laziness and\r\nconsent made current in vulgar conversation....\r\n\r\nHe was superior to all those passions and affections which attend vulgar\r\nminds, and was guilty of no other ambition than of knowledge, and to be\r\nreputed a lover of all good men; and that made him too much a contemner\r\nof those arts, which must be indulged in the transactions of human\r\naffairs....\r\n\r\nHe had a courage of the most clear and keen temper, and so far from\r\nfear, that he seemed not without some appetite of danger; and therefore,\r\nupon any occasion of action, he always engaged his person in those\r\ntroops which he thought, by the forwardness of the commanders, to be\r\nmost like to be farthest engaged; and in all such encounters, he had\r\nabout him an extraordinary cheerfulness, without at all affecting the\r\nexecution that usually attended them; in which he took no delight, but\r\ntook pains to prevent it, where it was not by resistance made necessary:\r\ninsomuch that at Edge-hill, when the enemy was routed, he was like to\r\nhave incurred great peril, by interposing to save those who had thrown\r\naway their arms, and against whom, it may be, others were more fierce\r\nfor their having thrown them away: so that a man might think he came\r\ninto the field chiefly out of curiosity to see the face of danger, and\r\ncharity to prevent the shedding of blood. Yet, in his natural\r\ninclination, he acknowledged he was addicted to the profession of a\r\nsoldier; and shortly after he came to his fortune, before he was of\r\nage, he went into the Low Countries, with a resolution of procuring\r\ncommand, and to give himself up to it; from which he was diverted by the\r\ncomplete inactivity of that summer; so he returned into England, and\r\nshortly after entered upon that vehement course of study we mentioned\r\nbefore, till the first alarm from the north; then again he made ready\r\nfor the field, and though he received some repulse in the command of a\r\ntroop of horse, of which he had a promise, he went a volunteer with the\r\nearl of Essex.\r\n\r\nFrom the entrance into this unnatural war, his natural cheerfulness and\r\nvivacity grew clouded, and a kind of sadness and dejection of spirit\r\nstole upon him, which he had never been used to; yet being one of those\r\nwho believed that one battle would end all differences, and that there\r\nwould be so great a victory on one side, that the other would be\r\ncompelled to submit to any conditions from the victor--which supposition\r\nand conclusion generally sunk into the minds of most men, and prevented\r\nthe looking after many advantages that might then have been laid hold\r\nof--he resisted those indispositions. But after the king\'s return from\r\nBrentford, and the furious resolution of the two Houses not to admit any\r\ntreaty for peace, those indispositions, which had before touched him,\r\ngrew into a perfect habit of uncheerfulness; and he, who had been so\r\nexactly unreserved and affable to all men, that his face and countenance\r\nwas always present, and vacant, to his company, and held any cloudiness,\r\nand less pleasantness of the visage, a kind of rudeness or incivility,\r\nbecame, on a sudden, less communicable; and thence, very sad, pale, and\r\nexceedingly affected with the spleen. In his clothes and habit, which he\r\nhad minded before always with more neatness, and industry, and expense,\r\nthan is usual to so great a soul, he was not now only incurious, but too\r\nnegligent; and in his reception of suitors, and the necessary or casual\r\naddresses to his place, so quick, and sharp, and severe, that there\r\nwanted not some men--strangers to his nature and disposition--who\r\nbelieved him proud and imperious; from which no mortal man was ever more\r\nfree....\r\n\r\nWhen there was any overture or hope of peace, he would be more erect and\r\nvigorous, and exceedingly solicitous to press anything which he thought\r\nmight promote it; and sitting among his friends, often, after a deep\r\nsilence, and frequent sighs, would, with a shrill and sad accent,\r\ningeminate the word _Peace, Peace_; and would passionately profess,\r\n"that the very agony of the war, and the view of the calamities and\r\ndesolation the kingdom did and must endure, took his sleep from him, and\r\nwould shortly break his heart." This made some think, or pretend to\r\nthink, "that he was so much enamoured of peace, that he would have been\r\nglad the king should have bought it at any price;" which was a most\r\nunreasonable calumny. As if a man, that was himself the most punctual\r\nand precise in every circumstance that might reflect upon conscience or\r\nhonor, could have wished the king to have committed a trespass against\r\neither....\r\n\r\nIn the morning before the battle, as always upon action, he was very\r\ncheerful, and put himself into the first rank of the Lord Byron\'s\r\nregiment, then advancing upon the enemy, who had lined the hedges on\r\nboth sides with musketeers; from whence he was shot with a musket in the\r\nlower part of the belly, and in the instant falling from his horse, his\r\nbody was not found till the next morning; till when, there was some\r\nhope he might have been a prisoner; though his nearest friends, who knew\r\nhis temper, received small comfort from that imagination. Thus fell that\r\nincomparable young man, in the four-and-thirtieth year of his age,\r\nhaving so much despatched the true business of life, that the oldest\r\nrarely attain to that immense knowledge, and the youngest enter not into\r\nthe world with more innocency: whosoever leads such a life, needs be the\r\nless anxious upon how short warning it is taken from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.

ON THE LOVE OF COUNTRY AS A PRINCIPLE OF ACTION.\r\n\r\nRICHARD STEELE.--1672-1729.\r\n\r\n_From_ THE TATLER, June 10, 1710.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen men look into their own bosoms, and consider the generous seeds\r\nwhich are there planted, that might, if rightly cultivated, ennoble\r\ntheir lives, and make their virtue venerable to futurity; how can they,\r\nwithout tears, reflect on the universal degeneracy from that public\r\nspirit, which ought to be the first and principal motive of all their\r\nactions? In the Grecian and Roman nations, they were wise enough to keep\r\nup this great incentive, and it was impossible to be in the fashion\r\nwithout being a patriot. All gallantry had its first source from hence;\r\nand to want a warmth for the public welfare, was a defect so scandalous,\r\nthat he who was guilty of it had no pretence to honor or manhood. What\r\nmakes the depravity among us, in this behalf, the more vexatious and\r\nirksome to reflect upon, is, that the contempt of life is carried as far\r\namongst us, as it could be in those memorable people; and we want only a\r\nproper application of the qualities which are frequent among us, to be\r\nas worthy as they. There is hardly a man to be found who will not fight\r\nupon any occasion, which he thinks may taint his own honor. Were this\r\nmotive as strong in everything that regards the public, as it is in this\r\nour private case, no man would pass his life away without having\r\ndistinguished himself by some gallant instance of his zeal towards it in\r\nthe respective incidents of his life and profession. But it is so far\r\notherwise, that there cannot at present be a more ridiculous animal,\r\nthan one who seems to regard the good of others. He, in civil life,\r\nwhose thoughts turn upon schemes which may be of general benefit,\r\nwithout further reflection, is called a projector; and the man whose\r\nmind seems intent upon glorious achievements, a knight-errant. The\r\nridicule among us runs strong against laudable actions; nay, in the\r\nordinary course of things, and the common regards of life, negligence of\r\nthe public is an epidemic vice. The brewer in his excise, the merchant\r\nin his customs, and, for aught we know, the soldier in his muster-rolls,\r\nthink never the worse of themselves for being guilty of their respective\r\nfrauds towards the public. This evil is come to such a fantastical\r\nheight, that he is a man _of_ a public spirit, and heroically affected\r\nto his country, who can go so far as even to turn usurer with all he\r\nhas in her funds. There is not a citizen in whose imagination such a one\r\ndoes not appear in the same light of glory, as Codrus, Sc\xc3\xa6vola, or any\r\nother great name in old Rome. Were it not for the heroes of so much _per\r\ncent._ as have regard enough for themselves and their nation to trade\r\nwith her with their wealth, the very notion of public love would long\r\nere now have vanished from among us. But however general custom may\r\nhurry us away in the stream of a common error, there is no evil, no\r\ncrime, so great as that of being cold in matters relating to the common\r\ngood. This is in nothing more conspicuous than in a certain willingness\r\nto receive anything that tends to the diminution of such as have been\r\nconspicuous instruments in our service. Such inclinations proceed from\r\nthe most low and vile corruption, of which the soul of man is capable.\r\nThis effaces not only the practice, but the very approbation of honor\r\nand virtue; and has had such an effect, that, to speak freely, the very\r\nsense of public good has no longer a part even in our conversations. Can\r\nthen the most generous motive of life, the good of others, be so easily\r\nbanished the breast of man? Is it possible to draw all our passions\r\ninward? Shall the boiling heat of youth be sunk in pleasures, the\r\nambition of manhood in selfish intrigues? Shall all that is glorious,\r\nall that is worth the pursuit of great minds, be so easily rooted out?\r\nWhen the universal bent of a people seems diverted from the sense of\r\ntheir common good, and common glory, it looks like a fatality, and\r\ncrisis of impending misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe generous nations we just now mentioned understood this so very well,\r\nthat there was hardly an oration ever made, which did not turn upon\r\nthis general sense, "That the love of their country was the first and\r\nmost essential quality in an honest mind." Demosthenes, in a cause\r\nwherein his fame, reputation, and fortune, were embarked, puts his all\r\nupon this issue; "Let the Athenians," says he, "be benevolent to me, as\r\nthey think I have been zealous for them." This great and discerning\r\norator knew, there was nothing else in nature could bear him up against\r\nhis adversaries, but this one quality of having shown himself willing or\r\nable to serve his country. This certainly is the test of merit; and the\r\nfirst foundation for deserving good-will is, having it yourself. The\r\nadversary of this orator at that time was \xc3\x86schines, a man of wily arts\r\nand skill in the world, who could, as occasion served, fall in with a\r\nnational start of passion, or sullenness of humor, which a whole nation\r\nis sometimes taken with as well as a private man; and by that means\r\ndivert them from their common sense, into an aversion for receiving\r\nanything in its true light. But when Demosthenes had awakened his\r\naudience with that one hint of judging by the general tenor of his life\r\ntowards them, his services bore down his opponent before him, who fled\r\nto the covert of his mean arts, until some more favorable opportunity\r\nshould offer against the superior merit of Demosthenes.\r\n\r\nIt were to be wished, that love of their country were the first\r\nprinciple of action in men of business, even for their own sakes; for\r\nwhen the world begins to examine into their conduct, the generality, who\r\nhave no share in, or hopes of any part in power or riches, but what is\r\nthe effect of their own labor or prosperity, will judge of them by no\r\nother method, than that of how profitable their administration has been\r\nto the whole. They who are out of the influence of men\'s fortune or\r\nfavor, will let them stand or fall by this one only rule; and men who\r\ncan bear being tried by it, are always popular in their fall. Those, who\r\ncannot suffer such a scrutiny, are contemptible in their advancement.\r\n\r\nBut I am here running into shreds of maxims from reading Tacitus this\r\nmorning, which has driven me from my recommendation of public spirit,\r\nwhich was the intended purpose of this lucubration. There is not a more\r\nglorious instance of it, than in the character of Regulus. This same\r\nRegulus was taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, and was sent by them to\r\nRome, in order to demand some Punic noblemen, who were prisoners, in\r\nexchange for himself; and was bound by an oath that he would return to\r\nCarthage, if he failed in his commission. He proposes this to the\r\nsenate, who were in suspense upon it, which Regulus observing, without\r\nhaving the least notion of putting the care of his own life in\r\ncompetition with the public good, desired them to consider that he was\r\nold, and almost useless; that those demanded in exchange were men of\r\ndaring tempers, and great merit in military affairs; and wondered they\r\nwould make any doubt of permitting him to go back to the short tortures\r\nprepared for him at Carthage, where he should have the advantage of\r\nending a long life both gloriously and usefully. This generous advice\r\nwas consented to; and he took his leave of his country and his weeping\r\nfriends, to go to certain death, with that cheerful composure, as a man,\r\nafter the fatigue of business in a court or a city, retires to the next\r\nvillage for the air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _When the heart is right there is true patriotism_.\r\n\r\n        BISHOP BERKELEY.--1684-1753.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. THE GOLDEN SCALES.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ADDISON.--1672-1719.\r\n\r\n_From_ THE SPECTATOR, August 21, 1712.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was lately entertaining myself with comparing Homer\'s balance, in\r\nwhich Jupiter is represented as weighing the fates of Hector and\r\nAchilles, with a passage of Virgil, wherein that deity is introduced as\r\nweighing the fates of Turnus and \xc3\x86neas. I then considered how the same\r\nway of thinking prevailed in the eastern parts of the world, as in those\r\nnoble passages of Scripture, where we are told, that the great king of\r\nBabylon, the day before his death, had been weighed in the balance, and\r\nbeen found wanting. In other places of the holy writings the Almighty is\r\ndescribed as weighing the mountains in scales, making the weight for the\r\nwinds, knowing the balancings of the clouds; and, in others, as weighing\r\nthe actions of men, and laying their calamities together in a balance.\r\nMilton, as I have observed in a former paper, had an eye to several of\r\nthese foregoing instances, in that beautiful description wherein he\r\nrepresents the archangel and the evil spirit as addressing themselves\r\nfor the combat, but parted by the balance which appeared in the heavens,\r\nand weighed the consequences of such a battle.\r\n\r\n    The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,\r\n    Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen\r\n    Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign,\r\n    Wherein all things created first he weigh\'d,\r\n    The pendulous round earth with balanced air\r\n    In counterpoise; now ponder; all events,\r\n    Battles and realms: in these he puts two weights,\r\n    The sequel each of parting and of fight:\r\n    The latter quick up flew, and kick\'d the beam;\r\n    Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the fiend.\r\n\r\n    "Satan, I know thy strength, and thou know\'st mine,\r\n    Neither our own, but given; what folly then\r\n    To boast what arms can do! since thine no more\r\n    Than Heaven permits; nor mine, though doubled now\r\n    To trample thee as mire: for proof look up,\r\n    And read thy lot in yon celestial sign,\r\n    Where thou art weigh\'d, and shewn how light, how weak,\r\n    If thou resist." The fiend look\'d up and knew\r\n    His mounted scale aloft; nor more: but fled\r\n    Murm\'ring, and with him fled the shades of night.\r\n\r\nThese several amusing thoughts having taken possession of my mind some\r\ntime before I went to sleep, and mingling themselves with my ordinary\r\nideas, raised in my imagination a very odd kind of vision. I was,\r\nmethought, replaced in my study, and seated in my elbow-chair, where I\r\nhad indulged the foregoing speculations, with my lamp burning by me, as\r\nusual. Whilst I was here meditating on several subjects of morality, and\r\nconsidering the nature of many virtues and vices, as materials for those\r\ndiscourses with which I daily entertain the public; I saw, methought, a\r\npair of golden scales hanging by a chain in the same metal over the\r\ntable that stood before me; when, on a sudden, there were great heaps of\r\nweights thrown down on each side of them. I found upon examining these\r\nweights, they showed the value of everything that is in esteem among\r\nmen. I made an essay of them, by putting the weight of wisdom in one\r\nscale, and that of riches in another, upon which the latter, to show its\r\ncomparative lightness, immediately "flew up and kicked the beam."\r\n\r\nBut, before I proceed, I must inform my reader, that these weights did\r\nnot exert their natural gravity, till they were laid in the golden\r\nbalance, insomuch that I could not guess which was light or heavy,\r\nwhilst I held them in my hand. This I found by several instances, for\r\nupon my laying a weight in one of the scales, which was inscribed by the\r\nword Eternity; though I threw in that of time, prosperity, affliction,\r\nwealth, poverty, interest, success, with many other weights, which in my\r\nhand seemed very ponderous, they were not able to stir the opposite\r\nbalance, nor could they have prevailed, though assisted with the weight\r\nof the sun, the stars, and the earth.\r\n\r\nUpon emptying the scales, I laid several titles and honors, with pomps,\r\ntriumphs, and many weights of the like nature, in one of them, and\r\nseeing a little glittering weight lie by me, I threw it accidentally\r\ninto the other scale, when, to my great surprise, it proved so exact a\r\ncounterpoise, that it kept the balance in an equilibrium. This little\r\nglittering weight was inscribed upon the edges of it with the word\r\nVanity. I found there were several other weights which were equally\r\nheavy, and exact counterpoises to one another; a few of them I tried, as\r\navarice and poverty, riches and content, with some others.\r\n\r\nThere were likewise several weights that were of the same figure, and\r\nseemed to correspond with each other, but were entirely different when\r\nthrown into the scales, as religion and hypocrisy, pedantry and\r\nlearning, wit and vivacity, superstition and devotion, gravity and\r\nwisdom, with many others.\r\n\r\nI observed one particular weight lettered on both sides, and upon\r\napplying myself to the reading of it, I found on one side written "_In\r\nthe dialect of men_," and underneath it, "CALAMITIES;" on the other side\r\nwas written, "_In the language of the gods_," and underneath,\r\n"BLESSINGS." I found the intrinsic value of this weight to be much\r\ngreater than I imagined, for it overpowered health, wealth,\r\ngood-fortune, and many other weights, which were much more ponderous in\r\nmy hand than the other.\r\n\r\nThere is a saying among the Scotch, that "an ounce of mother is worth a\r\npound of clergy;" I was sensible of the truth of this saying, when I saw\r\nthe difference between the weight of natural parts and that of learning.\r\nThe observation which I made upon these two weights opened to me a new\r\nfield of discoveries, for notwithstanding the weight of natural parts\r\nwas much heavier than that of learning, I observed that it weighed an\r\nhundred times heavier than it did before, when I put learning into the\r\nsame scale with it. I made the same observation upon faith and morality;\r\nfor notwithstanding the latter outweighed the former separately, it\r\nreceived a thousand times more additional weight from its conjunction\r\nwith the former, than what it had by itself. This odd phenomenon showed\r\nitself in other particulars, as in wit and judgment, philosophy and\r\nreligion, justice and humanity, zeal and charity, depth of sense and\r\nperspicuity of style, with innumerable other particulars, too long to be\r\nmentioned in this paper.\r\n\r\nAs a dream seldom fails of dashing seriousness with impertinence, mirth\r\nwith gravity, methought I made several other experiments of a more\r\nludicrous nature, by one of which I found that an English octavo was\r\nvery often heavier than a French folio; and by another, that an old\r\nGreek or Latin author weighed down a whole library of moderns. Seeing\r\none of my _Spectators_ lying by me, I laid it into one of the scales,\r\nand flung a twopenny piece in the other. The reader will not inquire\r\ninto the event, if he remembers the first trial which I have recorded in\r\nthis paper. I afterwards threw both the sexes into the balance; but as\r\nit is not for my interest to disoblige either of them, I shall desire to\r\nbe excused from telling the result of this experiment. Having an\r\nopportunity of this nature in my hands, I could not forbear throwing\r\ninto one scale the principles of a Tory, and in the other those of a\r\nWhig; but as I have all along declared this to be a neutral paper, I\r\nshall likewise desire to be silent under this head also, though upon\r\nexamining one of the weights, I saw the word TEKEL engraven on it in\r\ncapital letters.\r\n\r\nI made many other experiments, and though I have not room for them all\r\nin this day\'s speculation, I may perhaps reserve them for another. I\r\nshall only add, that upon my awaking I was sorry to find my golden\r\nscales vanished, but resolved for the future to learn this lesson from\r\nthem, not to despise or value any things for their appearances, but to\r\nregulate my esteem and passions towards them according to their real and\r\nintrinsic value.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _It must be so--Plato, thou reasonest well!--\r\n    Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,\r\n    This longing after immortality?\r\n    Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror,\r\n    Of falling into nought? Why shrinks the soul\r\n    Back on herself, and startles at destruction?\r\n    \'Tis the divinity that stirs within us;\r\n    \'Tis heaven itself that points out an hereafter,\r\n    And intimates eternity to man._\r\n\r\n        _From Cato._--ADDISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. MISJUDGED HOSPITALITY.\r\n\r\nJONATHAN SWIFT.--1667-1745.\r\n\r\n_From_ THE TATLER, March 6, 1711.\r\n\r\n_Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes\r\nEmollit mores._\r\n\r\nOVID.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose inferior duties of life which the French call _les petites\r\nmorales_, or the smaller morals, are with us distinguished by the name\r\nof good manners or breeding. This I look upon, in the general notion of\r\nit, to be a sort of artificial good sense, adapted to the meanest\r\ncapacities, and introduced to make mankind easy in their commerce with\r\neach other. Low and little understandings, without some rules of this\r\nkind, would be perpetually wandering into a thousand indecencies and\r\nirregularities in behavior; and in their ordinary conversation, fall\r\ninto the same boisterous familiarities that one observeth amongst them\r\nwhen a debauch hath quite taken away the use of their reason. In other\r\ninstances, it is odd to consider, that for want of common discretion,\r\nthe very end of good breeding is wholly perverted; and civility,\r\nintended to make us easy, is employed in laying chains and fetters upon\r\nus, in debarring us of our wishes, and in crossing our most reasonable\r\ndesires and inclinations. This abuse reigneth chiefly in the country, as\r\nI found to my vexation, when I was last there, in a visit I made to a\r\nneighbor about two miles from my cousin. As soon as I entered the\r\nparlor, they put me into the great chair that stood close by a huge\r\nfire, and kept me there by force, until I was almost stifled. Then a boy\r\ncame in great hurry to pull off my boots, which I in vain opposed,\r\nurging that I must return soon after dinner. In the meantime, the good\r\nlady whispered her eldest daughter, and slipped a key into her hand. The\r\ngirl returned instantly with a beer-glass half full of _aqua mirabilis_\r\nand syrup of gillyflowers. I took as much as I had a mind for; but madam\r\navowed I should drink it off--for she was sure it would do me good,\r\nafter coming out of the cold air--and I was forced to obey; which\r\nabsolutely took away my stomach. When dinner came in, I had a mind to\r\nsit at a distance from the fire; but they told me it was as much as my\r\nlife was worth, and set me with my back just against it. Although my\r\nappetite was quite gone, I resolved to force down as much as I could;\r\nand desired the leg of a pullet. "Indeed, Mr. Bickerstaff," says the\r\nlady, "you must eat a wing, to oblige me;" and so put a couple upon my\r\nplate. I was persecuted at this rate during the whole meal. As often as\r\nI called for small-beer, the master tipped the wink, and the servant\r\nbrought me a brimmer of October. Some time after dinner, I ordered my\r\ncousin\'s man, who came with me, to get ready the horses; but it was\r\nresolved I should not stir that night; and when I seemed pretty much\r\nbent upon going, they ordered the stable door to be locked; and the\r\nchildren hid my cloak and boots. The next question was, what I would\r\nhave for supper. I said I never ate anything at night; but was at last,\r\nin my own defence, obliged to name the first thing that came into my\r\nhead. After three hours spent chiefly in apologies for my entertainment,\r\ninsinuating to me, "that this was the worst time of the year for\r\nprovisions; that they were at a great distance from any market; that\r\nthey were afraid I should be starved; and that they knew they kept me to\r\nmy loss," the lady went, and left me to her husband--for they took\r\nspecial care I should never be alone. As soon as her back was turned,\r\nthe little misses ran backward and forward every moment; and constantly\r\nas they came in, or went out, made a courtesy directly at me, which, in\r\ngood manners, I was forced to return with a bow, and, "Your humble\r\nservant, pretty miss." Exactly at eight the mother came up, and\r\ndiscovered by the redness of her face that supper was not far off. It\r\nwas twice as large as the dinner, and my persecution doubled in\r\nproportion. I desired, at my usual hour, to go to my repose, and was\r\nconducted to my chamber by the gentleman, his lady, and the whole train\r\nof children. They importuned me to drink something before I went to bed;\r\nand upon my refusing, at last left a bottle of _stingo_, as they called\r\nit, for fear I should wake and be thirsty in the night. I was forced in\r\nthe morning to rise and dress myself in the dark, because they would not\r\nsuffer my kinsman\'s servant to disturb me at the hour I desired to be\r\ncalled. I was now resolved to break through all measures to get away;\r\nand after sitting down to a monstrous breakfast of cold beef, mutton,\r\nneats\' tongues, venison-pasty, and stale-beer, took leave of the family.\r\nBut the gentleman would needs see me part of my way, and carry me a\r\nshort-cut through his own grounds, which he told me would save half a\r\nmile\'s riding. This last piece of civility had like to have cost me\r\ndear, being once or twice in danger of my neck, by leaping over his\r\nditches, and at last forced to alight in the dirt; when my horse, having\r\nslipped his bridle, ran away, and took us up more than an hour to\r\nrecover him again. It is evident that none of the absurdities I met with\r\nin this visit proceeded from an ill intention, but from a wrong judgment\r\nof complaisance, and a misapplication in the rules of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. FROM THE "ESSAY ON MAN."[B]\r\n\r\nALEXANDER POPE.--1688-1744.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate,\r\n    All but the page prescrib\'d, their present state;\r\n    From brutes what men, from men what spirits know;\r\n    Or who could suffer being here below?\r\n    The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,\r\n    Had he thy reason, would he skip and play?\r\n    Pleas\'d to the last, he crops the flowery food,\r\n    And licks the hand just rais\'d to shed his blood.\r\n    O blindness to the future! kindly given,\r\n    That each may fill the circle mark\'d by heaven;\r\n    Who sees with equal eye, as God of all,\r\n    A hero perish, or a sparrow fall,\r\n    Atoms or systems into ruin hurl\'d,\r\n    And now a bubble burst, and now a world.\r\n      Hope humbly then; with trembling pinions soar;\r\n    Wait the great teacher Death; and God adore.\r\n    What future bliss he gives not thee to know,\r\n    But gives that hope to be thy blessing now.\r\n    Hope springs eternal in the human breast:\r\n    Man never is, but always to be, blest.\r\n    The soul, uneasy and confin\'d from home,\r\n    Rests and expatiates in a life to come.\r\n      Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor\'d mind\r\n    Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;\r\n    His soul proud science never taught to stray\r\n    Far as the solar walk, or milky way;\r\n    Yet simple nature to his hope has given,\r\n    Behind the cloud-topt hill, an humbler heaven;\r\n    Some safer world in depth of woods embraced,\r\n    Some happier island in the watery waste,\r\n    Where slaves once more their native land behold,\r\n    No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.\r\n    To be, contents his natural desire;\r\n    He asks no angel\'s wing, no seraph\'s fire;\r\n    But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,\r\n    His faithful dog shall bear him company.\r\n\r\n      What if the foot, ordain\'d the dust to tread,\r\n    Or hand, to toil, aspir\'d to be the head?\r\n    What if the head, the eye, or ear repin\'d\r\n    To serve mere engines to the ruling mind?\r\n    Just as absurd for any part to claim\r\n    To be another, in this general frame;\r\n    Just as absurd to mourn the tasks or pains\r\n    The great directing Mind of All ordains.\r\n      All are but parts of one stupendous whole,\r\n    Whose body Nature is, and God the soul;\r\n    That changed through all, and yet in all the same,\r\n    Great in the earth, as in the ethereal frame,\r\n    Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,\r\n    Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees;\r\n    Lives through all life, extends through all extent,\r\n    Spreads undivided, operates unspent;\r\n    Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part,\r\n    As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart;\r\n    As full, as perfect, in vile man that mourns,\r\n    As the rapt seraph that adores and burns:\r\n    To him no high, no low, no great, no small;\r\n    He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all.\r\n\r\n      All nature is but art unknown to thee;\r\n    All chance, direction, which thou canst not see;\r\n    All discord, harmony not understood;\r\n    All partial evil, universal good:\r\n    And spite of pride, in erring reason\'s spite,\r\n    One truth is clear, _Whatever is, is right_.\r\n\r\n      Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,\r\n    As, to be hated, needs but to be seen;\r\n    Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,\r\n    We first endure, then pity, then embrace.\r\n\r\n      Virtuous and vicious every man must be,\r\n    Few in the extreme, but all in the degree:\r\n    The rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise;\r\n    And even the best by fits what they despise.\r\n\r\n      Behold the child, by Nature\'s kindly law,\r\n    Pleas\'d with a rattle, tickled with a straw:\r\n    Some livelier plaything gives his youth delight,\r\n    A little louder, but as empty quite:\r\n    Scarfs, garters, gold, amuse his riper stage,\r\n    And beads and prayer-books are the toys of age:\r\n    Pleas\'d with this bauble still, as that before,\r\n    Till tired he sleeps, and life\'s poor play is o\'er.\r\n\r\n      Has God, thou fool! work\'d solely for thy good\r\n    Thy joy, thy pastime, thy attire, thy food?\r\n    Who for thy table feeds the wanton fawn,\r\n    For him as kindly spreads the flowery lawn.\r\n    Is it for thee the lark ascends and sings?\r\n    Joy tunes his voice, joy elevates his wings.\r\n    Is it for thee the linnet pours his throat?\r\n    Loves of his own and raptures swell the note.\r\n    The bounding steed you pompously bestride\r\n    Shares with his lord the pleasure and the pride.\r\n    Is thine alone the seed that strews the plain?\r\n    The birds of heaven shall vindicate their grain.\r\n    Thine the full harvest of the golden year?\r\n    Part pays, and justly, the deserving steer.\r\n    The hog, that ploughs not, nor obeys thy call,\r\n    Lives on the labors of this lord of all.\r\n      Know, Nature\'s children all divide her care;\r\n    The fur that warms a monarch warm\'d a bear.\r\n    While man exclaims, "See all things for my use!"\r\n    "See man for mine!" replies a pamper\'d goose:\r\n    And just as short of reason he must fall,\r\n    Who thinks all made for one, not one for all.\r\n\r\n      For forms of government let fools contest;\r\n    Whate\'er is best administer\'d is best:\r\n    For modes of faith let graceless zealots fight;\r\n    His can\'t be wrong whose life is in the right.\r\n    In faith and hope the world will disagree,\r\n    But all mankind\'s concern is charity:\r\n    All must be false that thwart this one great end,\r\n    And all of God that bless mankind or mend.\r\n\r\n      Honor and shame from no condition rise;\r\n    Act well your part, there all the honor lies.\r\n    Fortune in men has some small difference made,\r\n    One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade;\r\n    The cobbler apron\'d, and the parson gown\'d,\r\n    The friar hooded, and the monarch crown\'d.\r\n    "What differ more (you cry) than crown and cowl?"\r\n    I\'ll tell you, friend, a wise man and a fool.\r\n    You\'ll find, if once the monarch acts the monk,\r\n    Or, cobbler-like, the parson will be drunk,\r\n    Worth makes the man, and want of it, the fellow;\r\n    The rest is all but leather or prunello.\r\n\r\n      Go! if your ancient but ignoble blood\r\n    Has crept through scoundrels ever since the flood,\r\n    Go! and pretend your family is young,\r\n    Nor own your fathers have been fools so long.\r\n    What can ennoble sots, or slaves, or cowards?\r\n    Alas! not all the blood of all the Howards.\r\n\r\n      Who wickedly is wise, or madly brave,\r\n    Is but the more a fool, the more a knave.\r\n    Who noble ends by noble means obtains,\r\n    Or failing, smiles in exile or in chains,\r\n    Like good Aurelius let him reign, or bleed\r\n    Like Socrates,--that man is great indeed.\r\n\r\n    An honest man\'s the noblest work of God.\r\n\r\n    Know then this truth (enough for man to know),\r\n    "Virtue alone is happiness below."\r\n\r\n    ... Never elated while one man\'s oppress\'d;\r\n    Never dejected while another\'s bless\'d....[C]\r\n\r\n    See the sole bliss heaven could on all bestow!\r\n    Which who but feels can taste, but thinks can know:\r\n    Yet poor with fortune, and with learning blind,\r\n    The bad must miss, the good untaught will find:\r\n    Slave to no sect, who takes no private road,\r\n    But looks through nature up to nature\'s God;\r\n    Pursues that chain which links the immense design,\r\n    Joins heaven and earth, and mortal and divine:\r\n    Sees that no being any bliss can know,\r\n    But touches some above and some below;\r\n    Learns from this union of the rising whole,\r\n    The first, last purpose of the human soul;\r\n    And knows where faith, law, morals, all began,\r\n    All end, in love of God and love of man.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] If the _Essay on Man_ were shivered into fragments, it would not\r\nlose its value: for it is precisely its details which constitute its\r\nmoral as well as literary beauties.--A.

THE FIRST CRUSADE.\r\n\r\nDAVID HUME.--1711-1776.\r\n\r\n_From_ HISTORY OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Mahomet had, by means of his pretended revelations, united the\r\ndispersed Arabians under one head, they issued forth from their deserts\r\nin great multitudes; and being animated with zeal for their new\r\nreligion, and supported by the vigor of their new government, they made\r\ndeep impression on the eastern empire, which was far in the decline,\r\nwith regard both to military discipline and to civil policy. Jerusalem,\r\nby its situation, became one of their most early conquests; and the\r\nChristians had the mortification to see the holy sepulchre, and the\r\nother places, consecrated by the presence of their religious founder,\r\nfallen into the possession of infidels. But the Arabians or Saracens\r\nwere so employed in military enterprises, by which they spread their\r\nempire in a few years from the banks of the Ganges to the Straits of\r\nGibraltar, that they had no leisure for theological controversy: and\r\nthough the Alcoran, the original monument of their faith, seems to\r\ncontain some violent precepts, they were much less infected with the\r\nspirit of bigotry and persecution than the indolent and speculative\r\nGreeks, who were continually refining on the several articles of their\r\nreligious system. They gave little disturbance to those zealous\r\npilgrims, who daily flocked to Jerusalem; and they allowed every man,\r\nafter paying a moderate tribute, to visit the holy sepulchre, to perform\r\nhis religious duties, and to return in peace. But the Turcomans or\r\nTurks, a tribe of Tartars, who had embraced Mahometanism, having wrested\r\nSyria from the Saracens, and having, in the year 1065, made themselves\r\nmasters of Jerusalem, rendered the pilgrimage much more difficult and\r\ndangerous to the Christians. The barbarity of their manners, and the\r\nconfusions attending their unsettled government, exposed the pilgrims to\r\nmany insults, robberies, and extortions: and these zealots, returning\r\nfrom their meritorious fatigues and sufferings, filled all Christendom\r\nwith indignation against the infidels, who profaned the holy city by\r\ntheir presence, and derided the sacred mysteries in the very place of\r\ntheir completion. Gregory VII., among the other vast ideas which he\r\nentertained, had formed the design of uniting all the Western Christians\r\nagainst the Mahometans; but the egregious and violent invasions of that\r\npontiff on the civil power of princes, had created him so many enemies,\r\nand had rendered his schemes so suspicious, that he was not able to make\r\ngreat progress in this undertaking. The work was reserved for a meaner\r\ninstrument, whose low condition in life exposed him to no jealousy, and\r\nwhose folly was well calculated to coincide with the prevailing\r\nprinciples of the times.\r\n\r\nPeter, commonly called the Hermit, a native of Amiens in Picardy, had\r\nmade the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Being deeply affected with the dangers\r\nto which that act of piety now exposed the pilgrims, as well as with the\r\ninstances of oppression under which the Eastern Christians labored, he\r\nentertained the bold, and, in all appearance, impracticable project of\r\nleading into Asia, from the farthest extremities of the West, armies\r\nsufficient to subdue those potent and warlike nations which now held the\r\nholy city in subjection. He proposed his views to Martin II., who filled\r\nthe papal chair, and who, though sensible of the advantages which the\r\nhead of the Christian religion must reap from a religious war, and\r\nthough he esteemed the blind zeal of Peter a proper means for effecting\r\nthe purpose, resolved not to interpose his authority, till he saw a\r\ngreater probability of success. He summoned a council at Placentia,\r\nwhich consisted of four thousand ecclesiastics, and thirty thousand\r\nseculars; and which was so numerous that no hall could contain the\r\nmultitude, and it was necessary to hold the assembly in a plain. The\r\nharangues of the Pope, and of Peter himself, representing the dismal\r\nsituation of their brethren in the East, and the indignity suffered by\r\nthe Christian name, in allowing the holy city to remain in the hands of\r\ninfidels, here found the minds of men so well prepared, that the whole\r\nmultitude suddenly and violently declared for the war, and solemnly\r\ndevoted themselves to perform this service, so meritorious, as they\r\nbelieved it, to God and religion.\r\n\r\nBut though Italy seemed thus to have zealously embraced the enterprise,\r\nMartin knew, that, in order to insure success, it was necessary to\r\nenlist the greater and more warlike nations in the same engagement; and\r\nhaving previously exhorted Peter to visit the chief cities and\r\nsovereigns of Christendom, he summoned another council at Clermont in\r\nAuvergne. The fame of this great and pious design being now universally\r\ndiffused, procured the attendance of the greatest prelates, nobles, and\r\nprinces; and when the Pope and the Hermit renewed their pathetic\r\nexhortations, the whole assembly, as if impelled by an immediate\r\ninspiration, not moved by their preceding impressions, exclaimed with\r\none voice, _It is the will of God, It is the will of God!_--words deemed\r\nso memorable, and so much the result of a divine influence, that they\r\nwere employed as the signal of rendezvous and battle in all the future\r\nexploits of those adventurers. Men of all ranks flew to arms with the\r\nutmost ardor; and an exterior symbol, too, a circumstance of chief\r\nmoment, was here chosen by the devoted combatants. The sign of the\r\ncross, which had been hitherto so much revered among Christians, and\r\nwhich, the more it was an object of reproach among the Pagan world, was\r\nthe more passionately cherished by them, became the badge of union, and\r\nwas affixed to their right shoulder, by all who enlisted themselves in\r\nthis sacred warfare.\r\n\r\nEurope was at this time sunk into profound ignorance and superstition.\r\nThe ecclesiastics had acquired the greatest ascendant over the human\r\nmind: the people, who, being little restrained by honor, and less by\r\nlaw, abandoned themselves to the worst crimes and disorders, knew of no\r\nother expiation than the observances imposed on them by their spiritual\r\npastors: and it was easy to represent the holy war as an equivalent for\r\nall penances, and an atonement for every violation of justice and\r\nhumanity. But amidst the abject superstition which now prevailed, the\r\nmilitary spirit also had universally diffused itself; and though not\r\nsupported by art or discipline, was become the general passion of the\r\nnations governed by the feudal law. All the great lords possessed the\r\nright of peace and war: they were engaged in perpetual hostilities with\r\neach other: the open country was become a scene of outrage and disorder:\r\nthe cities, still mean and poor, were neither guarded by walls nor\r\nprotected by privileges, and were exposed to every insult: individuals\r\nwere obliged to depend for safety on their own force, or their private\r\nalliances: and valor was the only excellence which was held in esteem,\r\nor gave one man the pre-eminence above another. When all the particular\r\nsuperstitions, therefore, were here united in one great object, the\r\nardor for military enterprises took the same direction; and Europe,\r\nimpelled by its two ruling passions, was loosened, as it were, from its\r\nfoundations, and seemed to precipitate itself in one united body upon\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nAll orders of men, deeming the Crusades the only road to heaven,\r\nenlisted themselves under these sacred banners, and were impatient to\r\nopen the way with their sword to the holy city. Nobles, artisans,\r\npeasants, even priests, enrolled their names; and to decline this\r\nmeritorious service was branded with the reproach of impiety, or, what\r\nperhaps was esteemed still more disgraceful, of cowardice and\r\npusillanimity. The infirm and aged contributed to the expedition by\r\npresents and money; and many of them, not satisfied with the merit of\r\nthis atonement, attended it in person, and were determined, if\r\npossible, to breathe their last in sight of that city where their\r\nSaviour had died for them. Women themselves, concealing their sex under\r\nthe disguise of armor, attended the camp. The greatest criminals were\r\nforward in a service, which they regarded as a propitiation for all\r\ncrimes; and the most enormous disorders were, during the course of those\r\nexpeditions, committed by men enured to wickedness, encouraged by\r\nexample, and impelled by necessity. The multitude of the adventurers\r\nsoon became so great, that their more sagacious leaders, Hugh count of\r\nVermandois, brother to the French king, Raymond count of Toulouse,\r\nGodfrey of Bouillon, prince of Brabant, and Stephen count of Blois,\r\nbecame apprehensive lest the greatness itself of the armament should\r\ndisappoint its purpose; and they permitted an undisciplined multitude,\r\ncomputed at 300,000 men, to go before them, under the command of Peter\r\nthe Hermit and Walter the Moneyless. These men took the road towards\r\nConstantinople through Hungary and Bulgaria; and trusting that Heaven,\r\nby supernatural assistance, would supply all their necessities, they\r\nmade no provision for subsistance on their march. They soon found\r\nthemselves obliged to obtain by plunder, what they had vainly expected\r\nfrom miracles; and the enraged inhabitants of the countries through\r\nwhich they passed, gathering together in arms, attacked the disorderly\r\nmultitude and put them to slaughter without resistance. The more\r\ndisciplined armies followed after; and passing the straights at\r\nConstantinople, they were mustered in the plains of Asia, and amounted\r\nin the whole to the number of 700,000 combatants....\r\n\r\nAfter the adventurers in the holy war were assembled on the banks of the\r\nBosphorus, opposite to Constantinople, they proceeded on their\r\nenterprise; but immediately experienced those difficulties which their\r\nzeal had hitherto concealed from them, and for which, even if they had\r\nforeseen them, it would have been almost impossible to provide a remedy.\r\nThe Greek emperor, Alexis Comnenus, who had applied to the Western\r\nChristians for succor against the Turks, entertained hopes, and those\r\nbut feeble ones, of obtaining such a moderate supply, as, acting under\r\nhis command, might enable him to repulse the enemy: but he was extremely\r\nastonished to see his dominions overwhelmed, on a sudden, by such an\r\ninundation of licentious barbarians, who, though they pretended\r\nfriendship, despised his subjects as unwarlike, and detested them as\r\nheretical. By all the arts of policy, in which he excelled, he\r\nendeavored to divert the torrent; but while he employed professions,\r\ncaresses, civilities, and seeming services towards the leaders of the\r\ncrusade, he secretly regarded those imperious allies as more dangerous\r\nthan the open enemies by whom his empire had been formerly invaded.\r\nHaving effected that difficult point of disembarking them safely in\r\nAsia, he entered into a private correspondence with Soliman, emperor of\r\nthe Turks; and practised every insidious art, which his genius, his\r\npower, or his situation, enabled him to employ, for disappointing the\r\nenterprise, and discouraging the Latins from making thenceforward any\r\nsuch prodigious migrations. His dangerous policy was seconded by the\r\ndisorders inseparable from so vast a multitude, who were not united\r\nunder one head, and were conducted by leaders of the most independent\r\nintractable spirit, unacquainted with military discipline, and\r\ndetermined enemies to civil authority and submission. The scarcity of\r\nprovisions, the excesses of fatigue, the influence of unknown climates,\r\njoined to the want of concert in their operations, and to the sword of a\r\nwarlike enemy, destroyed the adventurers by thousands, and would have\r\nabated the ardor of men impelled to war by less powerful motives. Their\r\nzeal, however, their bravery, and their irresistible force, still\r\ncarried them forward, and continually advanced them to the great end of\r\ntheir enterprise. After an obstinate siege they took Nice, the seat of\r\nthe Turkish empire; they defeated Soliman in two great battles; they\r\nmade themselves masters of Antioch; and entirely broke the force of the\r\nTurks, who had so long retained those countries in subjection. The\r\nsoldan of Egypt, whose alliance they had hitherto courted, recovered, on\r\nthe fall of the Turkish power, his former authority in Jerusalem; and he\r\ninformed them by his ambassadors, that if they came disarmed to that\r\ncity, they might now perform their religious vows, and that all\r\nChristian pilgrims, who should thenceforth visit the holy sepulchre,\r\nmight expect the same good treatment which they had ever received from\r\nhis predecessors. The offer was rejected; the soldan was required to\r\nyield up the city to the Christians; and on his refusal, the champions\r\nof the cross advanced to the siege of Jerusalem, which they regarded as\r\nthe consummation of their labors. By the detachments which they had\r\nmade, and the disasters which they had undergone, they were diminished\r\nto the number of twenty thousand foot, and fifteen hundred horse; but\r\nthese were still formidable, from their valor, their experience, and the\r\nobedience which, from past calamities, they had learned to pay to their\r\nleaders. After a siege of five weeks, they took Jerusalem by assault;\r\nand, impelled by a mixture of military and religious rage, they put the\r\nnumerous garrison and inhabitants to the sword without distinction.\r\n\r\nNeither arms defended the valiant, nor submission the timorous: no age\r\nor sex was spared: infants on the breast were pierced by the same blow\r\nwith their mothers, who implored for mercy: even a multitude to the\r\nnumber of ten thousand persons, who had surrendered themselves\r\nprisoners, and were promised quarter, were butchered in cold blood by\r\nthose ferocious conquerors. The streets of Jerusalem were covered with\r\ndead bodies; and the triumphant warriors, after every enemy was subdued\r\nand slaughtered, immediately turned themselves, with the sentiments of\r\nhumiliation and contrition, towards the holy sepulchre. They threw aside\r\ntheir arms, still streaming with blood: they advanced with reclined\r\nbodies, and naked feet and heads, to that sacred monument: they sang\r\nanthems to their Saviour, who had there purchased their salvation by his\r\ndeath and agony: and their devotion, enlivened by the presence of the\r\nplace where he had suffered, so overcame their fury, that they dissolved\r\nin tears, and bore the appearance of every soft and tender sentiment. So\r\ninconsistent is human nature with itself! and so easily does the most\r\neffeminate superstition ally, both with the most heroic courage and with\r\nthe fiercest barbarity!\r\n\r\nThis great event happened on the fifth of July in the last year of the\r\neleventh century. The Christian princes and nobles, after choosing\r\nGodfrey of Bouillon king of Jerusalem, began to settle themselves in\r\ntheir new conquests; while some of them returned to Europe, in order to\r\nenjoy at home that glory, which their valor had acquired them in this\r\npopular and meritorious enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. THE BARD.\r\n\r\n_A Pindaric Ode._[D]\r\n\r\nTHOMAS GRAY.--1716-1771.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. 1.\r\n\r\n    "Ruin seize thee, ruthless King!\r\n      Confusion on thy banners wait;\r\n    Though fann\'d by Conquest\'s crimson wing,\r\n      They mock the air with idle state.\r\n    Helm, nor hauberk\'s twisted mail,\r\n    Nor e\'en thy virtues, Tyrant, shall avail\r\n      To save thy secret soul from nightly fears,\r\n      From Cambria\'s curse, from Cambria\'s tears!"\r\n    Such were the sounds that o\'er the crested pride\r\n      Of the first Edward scatter\'d wild dismay,\r\n    As down the steep of Snowdon\'s shaggy side\r\n      He wound with toilsome march his long array.\r\n    Stout Glo\'ster stood aghast in speechless trance:\r\n    "To arms!" cried Mortimer, and couch\'d his quivering lance.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. 2.\r\n\r\n      On a rock, whose haughty brow\r\n    Frowns o\'er old Conway\'s foaming flood,\r\n      Rob\'d in the sable garb of woe,\r\n    With haggard eyes the Poet stood;\r\n    (Loose his beard, and hoary hair\r\n    Stream\'d, like a meteor, to the troubled air),\r\n    And with a master\'s hand, and prophet\'s fire,\r\n    Struck the deep sorrows of his lyre.\r\n      "Hark, how each giant-oak, and desert cave,\r\n    Sighs to the torrent\'s awful voice beneath!\r\n    O\'er thee, O King! their hundred arms they wave,\r\n      Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe;\r\n    Vocal no more, since Cambria\'s fatal day,\r\n    To high-born Hoel\'s harp, or soft Llewellyn\'s lay.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. 3.\r\n\r\n      "Cold is Cadwallo\'s tongue,\r\n      That hush\'d the stormy main:\r\n    Brave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed:\r\n      Mountains, ye mourn in vain\r\n      Modred, whose magic song\r\n    Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topt head.\r\n      On dreary Arvon\'s shore they lie,\r\n    Smear\'d with gore, and ghastly pale:\r\n    Far, far aloof the affrighted ravens sail;\r\n      The famish\'d eagle screams, and passes by.\r\n    Dear lost companions of my tuneful art,\r\n      Dear, as the light that visits these sad eyes,\r\n    Dear, as the ruddy drops that warm my heart,\r\n      Ye died amidst your dying country\'s cries--\r\n    No more I weep.

ON AN ADDRESS TO THE THRONE CONCERNING AFFAIRS IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF LORDS--November 18th, 1777.\r\n\r\nLORD CHATHAM.--1708-1778.\r\n\r\n\r\nI rise, my Lords, to declare my sentiments on this most solemn and\r\nserious subject. It has imposed a load upon my mind, which, I fear,\r\nnothing can remove, but which impels me to endeavor its alleviation, by\r\na free and unreserved communication of my sentiments.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the address, I have the honor of heartily\r\nconcurring with the noble Earl who moved it. No man feels sincerer joy\r\nthan I do; none can offer more genuine congratulations on every\r\naccession of strength to the Protestant succession. I therefore join in\r\nevery congratulation on the birth of another princess, and the happy\r\nrecovery of her Majesty.\r\n\r\nBut I must stop here. My courtly complaisance will carry me no farther.\r\nI will not join in congratulation on misfortune and disgrace. I cannot\r\nconcur in a blind and servile address, which approves and endeavors to\r\nsanctify the monstrous measures which have heaped disgrace and\r\nmisfortune upon us. This, my Lords, is a perilous and tremendous moment!\r\nIt is not a time for adulation. The smoothness of flattery cannot now\r\navail--cannot save us in this rugged and awful crisis. It is now\r\nnecessary to instruct the Throne in the language of truth. We must\r\ndispel the illusion and the darkness which envelop it, and display, in\r\nits full danger and true colors, the ruin that is brought to our doors.\r\n\r\nThis, my Lords, is our duty. It is the proper function of this\r\nnoble assembly, sitting, as we do, upon our honors in this House,\r\nthe hereditary council of the Crown. _Who_ is the minister--_where_\r\nis the minister, that has dared to suggest to the Throne the\r\ncontrary, unconstitutional language this day delivered from it? The\r\naccustomed language from the Throne has been application to\r\nParliament for advice, and a reliance on its constitutional advice\r\nand assistance. As it is the right of Parliament to give, so it is\r\nthe duty of the Crown to ask it. But on this day, and in this\r\nextreme momentous exigency, no reliance is reposed on our\r\nconstitutional counsels! no advice is asked from the sober and\r\nenlightened care of Parliament! but the Crown, from itself and by\r\nitself, declares an unalterable determination to pursue\r\nmeasures--and what measures, my Lords? The measures that have\r\nproduced the imminent perils that threaten us; the measures that\r\nhave brought ruin to our doors.\r\n\r\nCan the minister of the day now presume to expect a continuance of\r\nsupport in this ruinous infatuation? Can Parliament be so dead to its\r\ndignity and its duty as to be thus deluded into the loss of the one and\r\nthe violation of the other? To give an unlimited credit and support for\r\nthe steady perseverance in measures not proposed for our parliamentary\r\nadvice, but dictated and forced upon us--in measures, I say, my Lords,\r\nwhich have reduced this late flourishing empire to ruin and contempt!\r\n"But yesterday, and England might have stood against the world: now none\r\nso poor to do her reverence." I use the words of a poet; but, though it\r\nbe poetry, it is no fiction. It is a shameful truth, that not only the\r\npower and strength of this country are wasting away and expiring, but\r\nher well-earned glories, her true honor, and substantial dignity are\r\nsacrificed.\r\n\r\nFrance, my Lords, has insulted you; she has encouraged and sustained\r\nAmerica; and, whether America be wrong or right, the dignity of\r\nthis country ought to spurn at the officious insult of French\r\ninterference. The ministers and ambassadors of those who are called\r\nrebels and enemies are in Paris; in Paris they transact the\r\nreciprocal interests of America and France. Can there be a more\r\nmortifying insult? Can even our ministers sustain a more humiliating\r\ndisgrace? Do they dare to resent it? Do they presume even to hint a\r\nvindication of their honor, and the dignity of the State, by\r\nrequiring the dismission of the plenipotentiaries of America? Such\r\nis the degradation to which they have reduced the glories of\r\nEngland! The people whom they affect to call contemptible rebels,\r\nbut whose growing power has at last obtained the name of enemies;\r\nthe people with whom they have engaged this country in war, and\r\nagainst whom they now command our implicit support in every measure\r\nof desperate hostility--this people, despised as rebels, or\r\nacknowledged as enemies, are abetted against you, supplied with\r\nevery military store, their interests consulted, and their\r\nambassadors entertained, by your inveterate enemy! and our ministers\r\ndare not interpose with dignity or effect. Is this the honor of a\r\ngreat kingdom? Is this the indignant spirit of England, who "but\r\nyesterday" gave law to the house of Bourbon? My Lords, the dignity\r\nof nations demands a decisive conduct in a situation like this....\r\n\r\nMy Lords, this ruinous and ignominious situation, where we can\r\nnot act with success, nor suffer with honor, calls upon us to\r\nremonstrate in the strongest and loudest language of truth, to\r\nrescue the ear of majesty from the delusions which surround it. The\r\ndesperate state of our arms abroad is in part known. No man thinks\r\nmore highly of them than I do. I love and honor the English troops.\r\nI know their virtues and their valor. I know they can achieve\r\nanything except impossibilities; and I know that the conquest of\r\nEnglish America _is an impossibility_. You cannot, I venture to say\r\nit, _you cannot_ conquer America. Your armies in the last war\r\neffected everything that could be effected; and what was it? It cost\r\na numerous army, under the command of a most able general [Lord\r\nAmherst], now a noble Lord in this House, a long and laborious\r\ncampaign, to expel five thousand Frenchmen from French America. My\r\nLords, _you cannot conquer America_. What is your present situation\r\nthere? We do not know the worst; but we know that in three campaigns\r\nwe have done nothing and suffered much. Besides the sufferings,\r\nperhaps _total loss_ of the Northern force, the best appointed army\r\nthat ever took the field, commanded by Sir William Howe, has retired\r\nfrom the American lines. _He was obliged_ to relinquish his attempt,\r\nand with great delay and danger to adopt a new and distant plan of\r\noperations. We shall soon know, and in any event have reason to\r\nlament, what may have happened since. As to conquest, therefore, my\r\nLords, I repeat, it is impossible. You may swell every expense and\r\nevery effort still more extravagantly; pile and accumulate every\r\nassistance you can buy or borrow; traffic and barter with every\r\nlittle pitiful German prince that sells and sends his subjects to\r\nthe shambles of a foreign prince; your efforts are forever vain and\r\nimpotent--doubly so from this mercenary aid on which you rely; for\r\nit irritates, to an incurable resentment, the minds of your enemies,\r\nto overrun them with the mercenary sons of rapine and plunder,\r\ndevoting them and their possessions to the rapacity of hireling\r\ncruelty! If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, while a\r\nforeign troop was landed in my country, I never would lay down my\r\narms--never--never--never.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, who is the man, that, in addition to these disgraces\r\nand mischiefs of our army, has dared to authorize and associate to\r\nour arms the tomahawk and scalping-knife of the savage? to call into\r\ncivilized alliance the wild and inhuman savage of the woods; to\r\ndelegate to the merciless Indian the defence of disputed rights, and\r\nto wage the horrors of his barbarous war against our brethren? My\r\nLords, these enormities cry aloud for redress and punishment. Unless\r\nthoroughly done away, it will be a stain on the national character.\r\nIt is a violation of the Constitution. I believe it is against law.\r\nIt is not the least of our national misfortunes that the strength\r\nand character of our army are thus impaired. Infected with the\r\nmercenary spirit of robbery and rapine, familiarized to the horrid\r\nscenes of savage cruelty, it can no longer boast of the noble and\r\ngenerous principles which dignify a soldier, no longer sympathize\r\nwith the dignity of the royal banner, nor feel the pride, pomp, and\r\ncircumstance of glorious war, "that make ambition virtue!" What\r\nmakes ambition virtue?--the sense of honor. But is the sense of\r\nhonor consistent with a spirit of plunder, or the practice of\r\nmurder? Can it flow from mercenary motives, or can it prompt to\r\ncruel deeds?\r\n\r\nThe independent views of America have been stated and asserted as the\r\nfoundation of this address. My Lords, no man wishes for the due\r\ndependence of America on this country more than I do. To preserve it,\r\nand not confirm that state of independence into which your measures\r\nhitherto have driven them, is the object which we ought to unite in\r\nattaining. The Americans, contending for their rights against arbitrary\r\nexactions, I love and admire. It is the struggle of free and virtuous\r\npatriots. But, contending for independency and total disconnection from\r\nEngland, as an Englishman, I cannot wish them success; for in a due\r\nconstitutional dependency, including the ancient supremacy of this\r\ncountry in regulating their commerce and navigation, consists the mutual\r\nhappiness and prosperity both of England and America. She derived\r\nassistance and protection from us; and we reaped from her the most\r\nimportant advantages. She was, indeed, the fountain of our wealth, the\r\nnerve of our strength, the nursery and basis of our naval power. It is\r\nour duty, therefore, my Lords, if we wish to save our country, most\r\nseriously to endeavor the recovery of these most beneficial subjects;\r\nand in this perilous crisis, perhaps the present moment may be the only\r\none in which we can hope for success. For in their negotiations with\r\nFrance, they have, or think they have, reason to complain; though it be\r\nnotorious that they have received from that power important supplies and\r\nassistance of various kinds, yet it is certain they expected it in a\r\nmore decisive and immediate degree. America is in ill humor with France;\r\non some points they have not entirely answered her expectations. Let us\r\nwisely take advantage of every possible moment of reconciliation.\r\nBesides, the natural disposition of America herself still leans toward\r\nEngland; to the old habits of connection and mutual interest that united\r\nboth countries. This _was_ the established sentiment of all the\r\ncontinent; and still, my Lords, in the great and principal part, the\r\nsound part of America, this wise and affectionate disposition prevails.\r\nAnd there is a very considerable part of America yet sound--the middle\r\nand the southern provinces. Some parts may be factious and blind to\r\ntheir true interests; but if we express a wise and benevolent\r\ndisposition to communicate with them those immutable rights of nature\r\nand those constitutional liberties to which they are equally entitled\r\nwith ourselves, by a conduct so just and humane we shall confirm the\r\nfavorable and conciliate the adverse. I say, my Lords, the rights and\r\nliberties to which they are equally entitled with ourselves, _but no\r\nmore_. I would participate to them every enjoyment and freedom which the\r\ncolonizing subjects of a free state can possess, or wish to possess; and\r\nI do not see why they should not enjoy every fundamental right in their\r\nproperty, and every original substantial liberty, which Devonshire, or\r\nSurrey, or the county I live in, or any other county in England, can\r\nclaim; reserving always, as the sacred right of the mother country, the\r\ndue constitutional dependency of the colonies. The inherent supremacy of\r\nthe state in regulating and protecting the navigation and commerce of\r\nall her subjects, is necessary for the mutual benefit and preservation\r\nof every part, to constitute and preserve the prosperous arrangement of\r\nthe whole empire.\r\n\r\nThe sound parts of America, of which I have spoken, must be sensible of\r\nthese great truths and of their real interests. America is not in that\r\nstate of desperate and contemptible rebellion which this country has\r\nbeen deluded to believe. It is not a wild and lawless banditti, who,\r\nhaving nothing to lose, might hope to snatch something from public\r\nconvulsions. Many of their leaders and great men have a great stake in\r\nthis great contest. The gentleman who conducts their armies, I am told,\r\nhas an estate of four or five thousand pounds a year; and when I\r\nconsider these things, I cannot but lament the inconsiderate violence of\r\nour penal acts, our declaration of treason and rebellion, with all the\r\nfatal effects of attainder and confiscation.\r\n\r\nAs to the disposition of foreign powers which is asserted [in the King\'s\r\nspeech] to be pacific and friendly, let us judge, my Lords, rather by\r\ntheir actions and the nature of things than by interested assertions.\r\nThe uniform assistance supplied to America by France suggests a\r\ndifferent conclusion. The most important interests of France in\r\naggrandizing and enriching herself with what she most wants, supplies of\r\nevery naval store from America, must inspire her with different\r\nsentiments. The extraordinary preparations of the House of Bourbon, by\r\nland and by sea, from Dunkirk to the Straits, equally ready and willing\r\nto overwhelm these defenceless islands, should rouse us to a sense of\r\ntheir real disposition and our own danger. Not five thousand troops in\r\nEngland! hardly three thousand in Ireland! What can we oppose to the\r\ncombined force of our enemies? Scarcely twenty ships of the line so\r\nfully or sufficiently manned, that any admiral\'s reputation would permit\r\nhim to take the command of. The river of Lisbon in the possession of our\r\nenemies! The seas swept by American privateers! Our Channel trade torn\r\nto pieces by them! In this complicated crisis of danger, weakness at\r\nhome, and calamity abroad, terrified and insulted by the neighboring\r\npowers, unable to act in America, or acting only to be destroyed, where\r\nis the man with the forehead to promise or hope for success in such a\r\nsituation, or from perseverance in the measures that have driven us to\r\nit? Who has the forehead to do so? Where is that man? I should be glad\r\nto see his face.\r\n\r\nYou cannot _conciliate_ America by your present measures. You cannot\r\n_subdue_ her by your present or by any measures. What, then, can you do?\r\nYou cannot conquer; you cannot gain; but you can _address_; you can lull\r\nthe fears and anxieties of the moment into an ignorance of the danger\r\nthat should produce them. But, my Lords, the time demands the language\r\nof truth. We must not now apply the flattering unction of servile\r\ncompliance or blind complaisance. In a just and necessary war, to\r\nmaintain the rights or honor of my country, I would strip the shirt from\r\nmy back to support it. But in such a war as this, unjust in its\r\nprinciple, impracticable in its means, and ruinous in its consequences,\r\nI would not contribute a single effort nor a single shilling. I do not\r\ncall for vengeance on the heads of those who have been guilty; I only\r\nrecommend to them to make their retreat. Let them walk off; and let them\r\nmake haste, or they may be assured that speedy and condign punishment\r\nwill overtake them.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have submitted to you, with the freedom and truth which I\r\nthink my duty, my sentiments on your present awful situation. I have\r\nlaid before you the ruin of your power, the disgrace of your reputation,\r\nthe pollution of your discipline, the contamination of your morals, the\r\ncomplication of calamities, foreign and domestic, that overwhelm your\r\nsinking country. Your dearest interests, your own liberties, the\r\nConstitution itself totters to the foundation. All this disgraceful\r\ndanger, this multitude of misery, is the monstrous offspring of this\r\nunnatural war. We have been deceived and deluded too long. Let us now\r\nstop short. This is the crisis--the only crisis of time and situation,\r\nto give us a possibility of escape from the fatal effects of our\r\ndelusions. But if, in an obstinate and infatuated perseverance in folly,\r\nwe slavishly echo the peremptory words this day presented to us, nothing\r\ncan save this devoted country from complete and final ruin. We madly\r\nrush into multiplied miseries, and "confusion worse confounded."\r\n\r\nIs it possible, can it be believed, that ministers are yet blind to this\r\nimpending destruction? I did hope, that instead of this false and empty\r\nvanity, this overweening pride, engendering high conceits and\r\npresumptuous imaginations, ministers would have humbled themselves in\r\ntheir errors, would have confessed and retracted them, and by an active,\r\nthough a late, repentance, have endeavored to redeem them. But, my\r\nLords, since they had neither sagacity to foresee, nor justice nor\r\nhumanity to shun these oppressive calamities--since not even severe\r\nexperience can make them feel, nor the imminent ruin of their country\r\nawaken them from their stupefaction, the guardian care of Parliament\r\nmust interpose. I shall, therefore, my Lords, propose to you an\r\namendment of the address to his Majesty, to be inserted immediately\r\nafter the two first paragraphs of congratulation on the birth of a\r\nprincess, to recommend an immediate cessation of hostilities, and the\r\ncommencement of a treaty to restore peace and liberty to America,\r\nstrength and happiness to England, security and permanent prosperity to\r\nboth countries. This, my Lords, is yet in our power; and let not the\r\nwisdom and justice of your Lordships neglect the happy, and, perhaps,\r\nthe only opportunity. By the establishment of irrevocable law, founded\r\non mutual rights, and ascertained by treaty, these glorious enjoyments\r\nmay be firmly perpetuated. And let me repeat to your Lordships, that the\r\nstrong bias of America, at least of the wise and sounder parts of it,\r\nnaturally inclines to this happy and constitutional reconnection with\r\nyou. Notwithstanding the temporary intrigues with France, we may still\r\nbe assured of their ancient and confirmed partiality to us. America and\r\nFrance _cannot_ be congenial.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, to encourage and confirm that innate inclination to this\r\ncountry, founded on every principle of affection, as well as\r\nconsideration of interest; to restore that favorable disposition into a\r\npermanent and powerful reunion with this country; to revive the mutual\r\nstrength of the empire; again to awe the House of Bourbon, instead of\r\nmeanly truckling, as our present calamities compel us, to every insult\r\nof French caprice and Spanish punctilio; to re-establish our commerce;\r\nto reassert our rights and our honor; to confirm our interests, and\r\nrenew our glories forever--a consummation most devoutly to be\r\nendeavored! and which, I trust, may yet arise from reconciliation with\r\nAmerica--I have the honor of submitting to you the following amendment,\r\nwhich I move to be inserted after the two first paragraphs of the\r\naddress:\r\n\r\n    "And that this House does most humbly advise and supplicate his\r\n    Majesty to be pleased to cause the most speedy and effectual\r\n    measures to be taken for restoring peace in America; and that no\r\n    time may be lost in proposing an immediate opening of a treaty\r\n    for the final settlement of the tranquillity of these invaluable\r\n    provinces, by a removal of the unhappy causes of this ruinous\r\n    civil war, and by a just and adequate security against the\r\n    return of the like calamities in times to come. And this House\r\n    desire to offer the most dutiful assurances to his Majesty, that\r\n    they will, in due time, cheerfully co-operate with the\r\n    magnanimity and tender goodness of his Majesty for the\r\n    preservation of his people, by such explicit and most solemn\r\n    declarations, and provisions of fundamental and irrevocable\r\n    laws, as may be judged necessary for the ascertaining and fixing\r\n    forever the respective rights of Great Britain and her\r\n    colonies."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII. FROM "THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD."\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILY USE ART, WHICH IS OPPOSED WITH STILL GREATER.\r\n\r\nOLIVER GOLDSMITH.--1728-1774.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever might have been Sophia\'s sensations, the rest of the family was\r\neasily consoled for Mr. Burchell\'s absence by the company of our\r\nlandlord, whose visits now became more frequent and longer. Though he\r\nhad been disappointed in procuring my daughters the amusements of the\r\ntown, as he designed, he took every opportunity of supplying them with\r\nthose little recreations which our retirement would admit of. He usually\r\ncame in the morning, and while my son and I followed our occupations\r\nabroad, he sat with the family at home, and amused them by describing\r\nthe town, with every part of which he was particularly acquainted. He\r\ncould repeat all the observations that were retailed in the atmosphere\r\nof the play-houses, and had all the good things of the high wits by rote\r\nlong before they made their way into the jest-books. The intervals\r\nbetween conversation were employed in teaching my daughters piquet, or\r\nsometimes in setting my two little ones to box to make them _sharp_, as\r\nhe called it; but the hopes of having him for a son-in-law, in some\r\nmeasure blinded us to all his imperfections. It must be owned that my\r\nwife laid a thousand schemes to entrap him; or, to speak it more\r\ntenderly, used every art to magnify the merit of her daughter. If the\r\ncakes at tea ate short and crisp, they were made by Olivia: if the\r\ngooseberry wine was well knit, the gooseberries were of her gathering:\r\nit was her fingers that gave the pickles their peculiar green; and in\r\nthe composition of a pudding, it was her judgment that mixed the\r\ningredients. Then the poor woman would sometimes tell the \'squire, that\r\nshe thought him and Olivia extremely of a size, and would bid both stand\r\nup to see which was tallest. These instances of cunning, which she\r\nthought impenetrable, yet which everybody saw through, were very\r\npleasing to our benefactor, who gave every day some new proofs of his\r\npassion, which, though they had not risen to proposals of marriage, yet\r\nwe thought fell but little short of it; and his slowness was attributed\r\nsometimes to native bashfulness, and sometimes to his fear of offending\r\nhis uncle. An occurrence, however, which happened soon after, put it\r\nbeyond a doubt that he designed to become one of our family; my wife\r\neven regarded it as an absolute promise.\r\n\r\nMy wife and daughters happening to return a visit to neighbor\r\nFlamborough\'s, found that family had lately got their pictures drawn by\r\na limner, who travelled the country, and took likenesses for fifteen\r\nshillings a head. As this family and ours had long a sort of rivalry in\r\npoint of taste, our spirit took the alarm at this stolen march upon us,\r\nand notwithstanding all I could say, and I said much, it was resolved\r\nthat we should have our pictures done too. Having, therefore, engaged\r\nthe limner, for what could I do? our next deliberation was to shew the\r\nsuperiority of our taste in the attitudes. As for our neighbor\'s family,\r\nthere were seven of them, and they were drawn with seven oranges, a\r\nthing quite out of taste, no variety in life, no composition in the\r\nworld. We desired to have something in a brighter style, and after many\r\ndebates, at length came to an unanimous resolution of being drawn\r\ntogether in one large historical family piece. This would be cheaper,\r\nsince one frame would serve for all, and it would be infinitely more\r\ngenteel; for all families of any taste were now drawn in the same\r\nmanner. As we did not immediately recollect an historical subject to hit\r\nus, we were contented each with being drawn as independent historical\r\nfigures. My wife desired to be represented as Venus, and the painter was\r\ndesired not to be too frugal of his diamonds in her stomacher and hair.\r\nHer two little ones were to be as Cupids by her side, while I, with my\r\ngown and band, was to present her with my books on the Whistonian\r\ncontroversy. Olivia would be drawn as an Amazon, sitting upon a bank of\r\nflowers, dressed in a green Joseph richly laced with gold, and a whip in\r\nher hand. Sophia was to be a shepherdess, with as many sheep as the\r\npainter could put in for nothing; and Moses was to be dressed out with\r\nan hat and white feather. Our taste so much pleased the \'squire, that he\r\ninsisted on being put in as one of the family, in the character of\r\nAlexander the Great, at Olivia\'s feet. This was considered by us all as\r\nan indication of his desire to be introduced into the family, nor could\r\nwe refuse his request. The painter was therefore set to work, and as he\r\nwrought with assiduity and expedition, in less than four days the whole\r\nwas completed. The piece was large, and it must be owned he did not\r\nspare his colors; for which my wife gave him great encomiums. We were\r\nall perfectly satisfied with his performance; but an unfortunate\r\ncircumstance had not occurred till the picture was finished, which now\r\nstruck us with dismay. It was so very large that we had no place in the\r\nhouse to fix it. How we all came to disregard so material a point is\r\ninconceivable; but certain it is, we had been all greatly remiss. The\r\npicture, therefore, instead of gratifying our vanity, as we hoped,\r\nleaned, in a most mortifying manner, against the kitchen wall, where the\r\ncanvas was stretched and painted, much too large to be got through any\r\nof the doors, and the jest of all our neighbors. One compared it to\r\nRobinson Crusoe\'s long-boat, too large to be removed; another thought it\r\nmore resembled a reel in a bottle; some wondered how it could be got\r\nout, but still more were amazed how it ever got in.\r\n\r\nBut though it excited the ridicule of some, it effectually raised more\r\nmalicious suggestions in many. The \'squire\'s portrait being found united\r\nwith ours, was an honor too great to escape envy. Scandalous whispers\r\nbegan to circulate at our expense, and our tranquillity was continually\r\ndisturbed by persons who came as friends to tell us what was said of us\r\nby enemies. These reports we always resented with becoming spirit; but\r\nscandal ever improves by opposition.\r\n\r\nWe once again therefore entered into a consultation upon obviating the\r\nmalice of our enemies, and at last came to a resolution which had too\r\nmuch cunning to give me entire satisfaction. It was this: as our\r\nprincipal object was to discover the honor of Mr. Thornhill\'s addresses,\r\nmy wife undertook to sound him by pretending to ask his advice in the\r\nchoice of an husband for her eldest daughter. If this was not found\r\nsufficient to induce him to a declaration, it was then resolved to\r\nterrify him with a rival. To this last step, however, I would by no\r\nmeans give my consent, till Olivia gave me the most solemn assurances\r\nthat she would marry the person provided to rival him upon this\r\noccasion, if he did not prevent it, by taking her himself. Such was the\r\nscheme laid, which, though I did not strenuously oppose, I did not\r\nentirely approve.\r\n\r\nThe next time, therefore, that Mr. Thornhill came to see us, my girls\r\ntook care to be out of the way, in order to give their mamma an\r\nopportunity of putting her scheme in execution; but they only retired to\r\nthe next room, whence they could overhear the whole conversation: my\r\nwife artfully introduced it, by observing, that one of the Miss\r\nFlamboroughs was like to have a very good match of it in Mr. Spanker. To\r\nthis the \'squire assenting, she proceeded to remark, that they who had\r\nwarm fortunes were always sure of getting good husbands: "But heaven\r\nhelp," continued she, "the girls that have none. What signifies beauty,\r\nMr. Thornhill? or what signifies all the virtue, and all the\r\nqualifications in the world, in this age of self-interest? It is not,\r\nwhat is she? but, what has she? is all the cry."\r\n\r\n"Madam," returned he, "I highly approve the justice, as well as the\r\nnovelty, of your remarks, and if I were a king, it should be otherwise.\r\nIt should then, indeed, be fine times for the girls without fortunes:\r\nour two young ladies should be the first for whom I would provide."\r\n\r\n"Ah, sir," returned my wife, "you are pleased to be facetious: but I\r\nwish I were a queen, and then I know where my eldest daughter should\r\nlook for an husband. But now that you have put it into my head,\r\nseriously, Mr. Thornhill, can\'t you recommend me a proper husband for\r\nher? She is now nineteen years old, well grown and well educated, and,\r\nin my humble opinion, does not want for parts."\r\n\r\n"Madam," replied he, "if I were to choose, I would find out a person\r\npossessed of every accomplishment that can make an angel happy. One with\r\nprudence, fortune, taste, and sincerity; such, madam, would be, in my\r\nopinion, the proper husband." "Ay, sir," said she, "but do you know of\r\nany such person?"--"No, Madam," returned he, "it is impossible to know\r\nany person that deserves to be her husband: she\'s too great a treasure\r\nfor one man\'s possession: she\'s a goddess. Upon my soul, I speak what I\r\nthink, she\'s an angel"--"Ah, Mr. Thornhill, you only flatter my poor\r\ngirl: but we have been thinking of marrying her to one of your tenants,\r\nwhose mother is lately dead, and who wants a manager; you know whom I\r\nmean, farmer Williams; a warm man, Mr. Thornhill, able to give her good\r\nbread; and who has several times made her proposals:" (which was\r\nactually the case) "but, sir," concluded she, "I should be glad to have\r\nyour approbation of our choice."--"How, Madam," replied he, "my\r\napprobation! My approbation of such a choice! Never. What! Sacrifice so\r\nmuch beauty and sense, and goodness, to a creature insensible of the\r\nblessing! Excuse me, I can never approve of such a piece of injustice!\r\nAnd I have my reasons!"--"Indeed, sir," cried Deborah, "If you have your\r\nreasons, that\'s another affair; but I should be glad to know those\r\nreasons."--"Excuse me, madam," returned he, "they lie too deep for\r\ndiscovery;" (laying his hand upon his bosom) "they remain buried,\r\nrivetted here."\r\n\r\nAfter he was gone, upon general consultation, we could not tell what to\r\nmake of these fine sentiments. Olivia considered them as instances of\r\nthe most exalted passion; but I was not quite so sanguine: yet, whatever\r\nthey might portend, it was resolved to prosecute the scheme of farmer\r\nWilliams, who, from my daughter\'s first appearance in the country, had\r\npaid her his addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. MEETING OF JOHNSON WITH WILKES.\r\n\r\n(1776).\r\n\r\nJAMES BOSWELL.--1740-1795.\r\n\r\n_From_ LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am now to record a very curious incident in Dr. Johnson\'s life, which\r\nfell under my own observation; of which _pars magna fui_, and which I am\r\npersuaded will, with the liberal-minded, be much to his credit.\r\n\r\nMy desire of being acquainted with celebrated men of every description\r\nhad made me, much about the same time, obtain an introduction to Dr.\r\nSamuel Johnson and to John Wilkes, Esq. Two men more different could not\r\nperhaps be selected out of all mankind. They had even attacked one\r\nanother with some asperity in their writings; yet I lived in habits of\r\nfriendship with both. I could fully relish the excellence of each; for I\r\nhave ever delighted in that intellectual chemistry, which can separate\r\ngood qualities from evil in the same person.\r\n\r\nSir John Pringle, "mine own friend and my father\'s friend," between whom\r\nand Dr. Johnson I in vain wished to establish an acquaintance, as I\r\nrespected and lived in intimacy with both of them, observed to me once,\r\nvery ingeniously, "It is not in friendship as in mathematics, where two\r\nthings, each equal to a third, are equal between themselves. You agree\r\nwith Johnson as a middle quality, and you agree with me as a middle\r\nquality; but Johnson and I should not agree." Sir John was not\r\nsufficiently flexible; so I desisted; knowing, indeed, that the\r\nrepulsion was equally strong on the part of Johnson; who, I know not\r\nfrom what cause, unless his being a Scotchman, had formed a very\r\nerroneous opinion of Sir John. But I conceived an irresistible wish, if\r\npossible, to bring Dr. Johnson and Mr. Wilkes together. How to manage\r\nit, was a nice and difficult matter.[E]\r\n\r\nMy worthy booksellers and friends, Messieurs Dilly in the Poultry, at\r\nwhose hospitable and well-covered table I have seen a greater number of\r\nliterary men than at any other, except that of Sir Joshua Reynolds, had\r\ninvited me to meet Mr. Wilkes and some more gentlemen on Wednesday, May\r\n15th. "Pray," said I, "let us have Dr. Johnson." "What, with Mr. Wilkes?\r\nnot for the world," said Mr. Edward Dilly: "Dr. Johnson would never\r\nforgive me." "Come," said I, "if you\'ll let me negotiate for you, I will\r\nbe answerable that all shall go well." _Dilly._ "Nay, if you will take\r\nit upon you, I am sure I shall be very happy to see them both here."\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the high veneration which I entertained for Dr. Johnson,\r\nI was sensible that he was sometimes a little actuated by the spirit of\r\ncontradiction, and by means of that I hoped I should gain my point. I\r\nwas persuaded that if I had come upon him with a direct proposal, "Sir,\r\nwill you dine in company with Jack Wilkes?" he would have flown into a\r\npassion, and would probably have answered, "Dine with Jack Wilkes, Sir!\r\nI\'d as soon dine with Jack Ketch." I, therefore, while we were sitting\r\nquietly by ourselves at his house in an evening, took occasion to open\r\nmy plan thus: "Mr. Dilly, Sir, sends his respectful compliments to you,\r\nand would be happy if you would do him the honor to dine with him on\r\nWednesday next along with me, as I must soon go to Scotland." _Johnson._\r\n"Sir, I am obliged to Mr. Dilly. I will wait upon him." _Boswell._\r\n"Provided, Sir, I suppose, that the company which he is to have is\r\nagreeable to you?" _Johnson._ "What do you mean, Sir? What do you take\r\nme for? Do you think I am so ignorant of the world as to imagine that I\r\nam to prescribe to a gentleman what company he is to have at his table?"\r\n_Boswell._ "I beg your pardon, Sir, for wishing to prevent you from\r\nmeeting people whom you might not like. Perhaps he may have some of what\r\nhe calls his patriotic friends with him." _Johnson._ "Well, Sir, and\r\nwhat then? What care I for his _patriotic friends_? Poh!" _Boswell._ "I\r\nshould not be surprised to find Jack Wilkes there." _Johnson._ "And if\r\nJack Wilkes _should_ be there, what is that to _me_, Sir? My dear\r\nfriend, let us have no more of this. I am sorry to be angry with you;\r\nbut really it is treating me strangely to talk to me as if I could not\r\nmeet any company whatever, occasionally." _Boswell._ "Pray forgive me,\r\nSir, I meant well. But you shall meet whoever comes, for me." Thus I\r\nsecured him, and told Dilly that he would find him very well pleased to\r\nbe one of his guests on the day appointed.\r\n\r\nUpon the much expected Wednesday, I called on him about half an hour\r\nbefore dinner, as I often did when we were to dine out together, to see\r\nthat he was ready in time, and to accompany him. I found him buffeting\r\nhis books, as upon a former occasion, covered with dust, and making no\r\npreparation for going abroad. "How is this, Sir?" said I. "Don\'t you\r\nrecollect that you are to dine at Mr. Dilly\'s?" _Johnson._ "Sir, I did\r\nnot think of going to Dilly\'s; it went out of my head. I have ordered\r\ndinner at home with Mrs. Williams." _Boswell._ "But, my dear Sir, you\r\nknow you were engaged to Mr. Dilly, and I told him so. He will expect\r\nyou, and will be much disappointed if you don\'t come." _Johnson._ "You\r\nmust talk to Mrs Williams about this."\r\n\r\nHere was a sad dilemma. I feared that what I was so confident I had\r\nsecured would yet be frustrated. He had accustomed himself to show Mrs.\r\nWilliams such a degree of humane attention, as frequently imposed some\r\nrestraint upon him; and I knew that if she should be obstinate, he would\r\nnot stir. I hastened down stairs to the blind lady\'s room, and told her\r\nI was in great uneasiness, for Dr. Johnson had engaged to me to dine\r\nthis day at Mr. Dilly\'s, but that he had told me he had forgotten his\r\nengagement, and had ordered dinner at home. "Yes, Sir," said she,\r\npretty peevishly, "Dr. Johnson is to dine at home." "Madam," said I,\r\n"his respect for you is such, that I know he will not leave you, unless\r\nyou absolutely desire it. But as you have so much of his company, I hope\r\nyou will be good enough to forego it for a day, as Mr. Dilly is a very\r\nworthy man, has frequently had agreeable parties at his house for Dr.\r\nJohnson, and will be vexed if the Doctor neglects him to-day. And then,\r\nMadam, be pleased to consider my situation; I carried the message, and I\r\nassured Mr. Dilly that Dr. Johnson was to come; and no doubt he has made\r\na dinner, and invited a company, and boasted of the honor he expected to\r\nhave. I shall be quite disgraced if the Doctor is not there." She\r\ngradually softened to my solicitations, which were certainly as earnest\r\nas most entreaties to ladies upon any occasion, and was graciously\r\npleased to empower me to tell Dr. Johnson, "That all things considered,\r\nshe thought he should certainly go." I flew back to him, still in dust,\r\nand careless of what should be the event, "indifferent in his choice to\r\ngo or stay"; but as soon as I had announced to him Mrs. Williams\'s\r\nconsent, he roared, "Frank, a clean shirt," and was very soon dressed.\r\nWhen I had him fairly seated in a hackney-coach with me, I exulted as\r\nmuch as a fortune-hunter who has got an heiress into a post-chaise with\r\nhim to set out for Gretna Green.\r\n\r\nWhen we entered Mr. Dilly\'s drawing room, he found himself in the midst\r\nof a company he did not know. I kept myself snug and silent, watching\r\nhow he would conduct himself. I observed him whispering to Mr. Dilly,\r\n"Who is that gentleman, Sir?"--"Mr. Arthur Lee." _Johnson._ "Too, too,\r\ntoo" (under his breath), which was one of his habitual mutterings. Mr.\r\nArthur Lee could not but be very obnoxious to Johnson, for he was not\r\nonly a _patriot_, but an _American_. He was afterwards minister from the\r\nUnited States at the court of Madrid. "And who is the gentleman in\r\nlace?"--"Mr. Wilkes, Sir." This information confounded him still more;\r\nhe had some difficulty to restrain himself, and, taking up a book, sat\r\ndown upon a window-seat and read, or at least kept his eye upon it\r\nintently for some time, till he composed himself. His feelings, I dare\r\nsay, were awkward enough. But he had no doubt recollected his having\r\nrated me for supposing that he could be at all disconcerted by any\r\ncompany, and he, therefore, resolutely set himself to behave quite as an\r\neasy man of the world, who could adapt himself at once to the\r\ndisposition and manners of those whom he might chance to meet.\r\n\r\nThe cheering sound of "Dinner is upon the table," dissolved his reverie,\r\nand we _all_ sat down without any symptoms of ill humor.... Mr. Wilkes\r\nplaced himself next to Dr. Johnson, and behaved to him with so much\r\nattention and politeness, that he gained upon him insensibly. No man ate\r\nmore heartily than Johnson, or loved better what was nice and delicate.\r\nMr. Wilkes was very assiduous in helping him to some fine veal. "Pray\r\ngive me leave, Sir--It is better here--A little of the brown--Some fat,\r\nSir--A little of the stuffing--Some gravy--Let me have the pleasure of\r\ngiving you some butter--Allow me to recommend a squeeze of this orange;\r\nor the lemon, perhaps may have more zest"--"Sir; sir, I am obliged to\r\nyou, Sir," cried Johnson, bowing, and turning his head to him with a\r\nlook for some time of "surly virtue," but, in a short while of\r\ncomplacency.\r\n\r\nFoote being mentioned, Johnson said, "He is not a good mimic." One of\r\nthe company added, "A merry-andrew, a buffoon." _Johnson._ "But he has\r\nwit too, and is not deficient in ideas, or in fertility and variety of\r\nimagery, and not empty of reading; he has knowledge enough to fill up\r\nhis part. One species of wit he has in an eminent degree, that of\r\nescape. You drive him into a corner with both hands; but he is gone,\r\nSir, when you think you have got him--like an animal that jumps over\r\nyour head. Then he has a great range for wit; he never lets truth stand\r\nbetween him and the jest, and he is sometimes mighty coarse. Garrick is\r\nunder many restraints from which Foote is free." _Wilkes._ "Garrick\'s\r\nwit is more like Lord Chesterfield\'s." _Johnson._ "The first time I was\r\nin company with Foote was at Fitzherbert\'s. Having no good opinion of\r\nthe fellow, I was resolved not to be pleased; and it is very difficult\r\nto please a man against his will. I went on eating my dinner pretty\r\nsullenly, affecting not to mind him. But the dog was so very comical,\r\nthat I was obliged to lay down my knife and fork, throw myself back in\r\nmy chair, and fairly laugh it out. No, Sir, he was irresistible. He upon\r\none occasion experienced, in an extraordinary degree, the efficacy of\r\nhis powers of entertaining. Amongst the many and various modes which he\r\ntried of getting money, he became a partner with a small-beer brewer,\r\nand he was to have a share of the profits for procuring customers\r\namongst his numerous acquaintance. Fitzherbert was one who took his\r\nsmall-beer, but it was so bad that the servants resolved not to drink\r\nit. They were at some loss how to notify their resolution, being afraid\r\nof offending their master, who, they knew, liked Foote much as a\r\ncompanion. At last they fixed upon a little black boy, who was rather a\r\nfavorite, to be their deputy, and deliver their remonstrance; and,\r\nhaving invested him with the sole authority of the kitchen, he was to\r\ninform Mr. Fitzherbert, in all their names, upon a certain day, that\r\nthey would drink Foote\'s small-beer no longer. On that day Foote\r\nhappened to dine at Fitzherbert\'s, and this boy served at table; he was\r\nso delighted with Foote\'s stories, and merriment, and grimace, that when\r\nhe went down stairs, he told them, \'This is the finest man I have ever\r\nseen. I will not deliver your message. I will drink his small-beer.\'"\r\n\r\n... Mr. Wilkes remarked, that "among all the bold flights of\r\nShakespeare\'s imagination, the boldest was making Birnam-wood march to\r\nDunsinane; creating a wood where there never was a shrub; a wood in\r\nScotland! ha! ha! ha!" And he also observed, that "the clannish slavery\r\nof the Highlands of Scotland was the single exception to Milton\'s remark\r\nof \'the mountain nymph, sweet Liberty,\' being worshipped in all hilly\r\ncountries." "When I was at Inverary," said he, "on a visit to my old\r\nfriend Archibald, Duke of Argyle, his dependents congratulated me on\r\nbeing such a favorite of his Grace. I said, \'It is, then, gentlemen,\r\ntruly lucky for me; for if I had displeased the Duke, and he had wished\r\nit, there is not a Campbell among you but would have been ready to bring\r\nJohn Wilkes\'s head to him in a charger. It would have been only\r\n\r\n    "\'Off with his head! so much for _Aylesbury_.\'\r\n\r\n"I was then member for Aylesbury."\r\n\r\n... Mr. Arthur Lee mentioned some Scotch who had taken possession of a\r\nbarren part of America, and wondered why they should choose it.\r\n_Johnson._ "Why, Sir, all barrenness is comparative. The _Scotch_ would\r\nnot know it to be barren." _Boswell._ "Come, come, he is flattering the\r\nEnglish. You have now been in Scotland, Sir, and say if you did not see\r\nmeat and drink enough there." _Johnson._ "Why, yes, Sir; meat and drink\r\nenough to give the inhabitants sufficient strength to run away from\r\nhome." All these quick and lively sallies were said sportively, quite in\r\njest, and with a smile, which showed that he meant only wit. Upon this\r\ntopic he and Mr. Wilkes could perfectly assimilate; here was a bond of\r\nunion between them, and I was conscious that as both of them had visited\r\nCaledonia, both were fully satisfied of the strange narrow ignorance of\r\nthose who imagine that it is a land of famine. But they amused\r\nthemselves with persevering in the old jokes. When I claimed a\r\nsuperiority for Scotland over England in one respect, that no man can be\r\narrested there for a debt merely because another swears it against him;\r\nbut there must first be the judgment of a court of law ascertaining its\r\njustice; and that a seizure of the person, before judgment is obtained,\r\ncan take place only if his creditor should swear that he is about to fly\r\nfrom the country, or, as it is technically expressed, is _in meditatione\r\nfug\xc3\xa6_;--_Wilkes._ "That, I should think, may be safely sworn of all the\r\nScotch nation." _Johnson_ (to Mr. Wilkes). "You must know, Sir, I lately\r\ntook my friend Boswell, and showed him genuine civilized life in an\r\nEnglish provincial town. I turned him loose at Lichfield, my native\r\ncity, that he might see for once real civility; for you know he lives\r\namong savages in Scotland and among rakes in London." _Wilkes._ "Except\r\nwhen he is with grave, sober, decent people, like you and me." _Johnson_\r\n(smiling). "And we ashamed of him."\r\n\r\n... This record, though by no means so perfect as I could wish, will\r\nserve to give a notion of a very curious interview, which was not only\r\npleasing at the time, but had the agreeable and benignant effect of\r\nreconciling any animosity, and sweetening any acidity, which, in the\r\nvarious bustle of political contest, had been produced in the minds of\r\ntwo men, who, though widely different, had so many things in\r\ncommon--classical learning, modern literature, wit and humor, and ready\r\nrepartee--that it would have been much to be regretted if they had been\r\nforever at a distance from each other.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke gave me much credit for this successful _negotiation_; and\r\npleasantly said, "that there was nothing equal to it in the whole\r\nhistory of the _corps diplomatique_."\r\n\r\nI attended Dr. Johnson home, and had the satisfaction to hear him tell\r\nMrs. Williams how much he had been pleased with Mr. Wilkes\'s company,\r\nand what an agreeable day he had passed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[E] Johnson\'s dislike of Mr. Wilkes was so great that it extended\r\neven to his connections. He happened to dine one day at Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds\'s with a large and distinguished company, amongst whom were\r\nMr. Wilkes\'s brother, Israel, and his lady. In the course of\r\nconversation, Mr. Israel Wilkes was about to make some remark, when\r\nJohnson suddenly stopped him with, "I hope, sir, what you are going\r\nto say may be better worth hearing than what you have already said."\r\nThis rudeness shocked and spread a gloom over the whole party,\r\nparticularly as Mr. Israel Wilkes was a gentleman of a very amiable\r\ncharacter and of refined taste, and, what Dr. Johnson little\r\nsuspected, a very loyal subject. Johnson afterwards owned to me that\r\nhe was very sorry that he had "_snubbed_ Wilkes, as his wife was\r\npresent." I replied, that he should be sorry for many reasons. "No,"\r\nsaid Johnson, who was very reluctant to apologize for offences of\r\nthis nature; "no, I only regret it because his wife was by." I\r\nbelieve that he had no kind of motive for this incivility to Mr.\r\nIsrael Wilkes but disgust at his brother\'s political principles.\r\n\r\n    MISS REYNOLDS\'S RECOLLECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV. THE POLICY OF THE EMPIRE IN THE FIRST CENTURY.\r\n\r\nEDWARD GIBBON.--1737-1794.\r\n\r\n_From_ THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second century of the Christian era, the empire of Rome\r\ncomprehended the fairest part of the earth, and the most civilized\r\nportion of mankind. The frontiers of that extensive monarchy were\r\nguarded by ancient renown and disciplined valor. The gentle but powerful\r\ninfluence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the\r\nprovinces. Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages\r\nof wealth and luxury. The image of a free constitution was preserved\r\nwith decent reverence: the Roman senate appeared to possess the\r\nsovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive\r\npowers of government. During a happy period of more than fourscore\r\nyears, the public administration was conducted by the virtue and\r\nabilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines.\r\n\r\nThe principal conquests of the Romans were achieved under the republic;\r\nand the emperors, for the most part, were satisfied with preserving\r\nthose dominions which had been acquired by the policy of the senate, the\r\nactive emulation of the consuls, and the martial enthusiasm of the\r\npeople. The seven first centuries were filled with a rapid succession of\r\ntriumphs; but it was reserved for Augustus to relinquish the ambitious\r\ndesign of subduing the whole earth, and to introduce a spirit of\r\nmoderation into the public councils. Inclined to peace by his temper and\r\nsituation, it was easy for him to discover that Rome, in her present\r\nexalted situation, had much less to hope than to fear from the chance of\r\narms; and that, in the prosecution of remote wars, the undertaking\r\nbecame every day more difficult, the event more doubtful, and the\r\npossession more precarious and less beneficial. The experience of\r\nAugustus added weight to these salutary reflections, and effectually\r\nconvinced him that, by the prudent vigor of his counsels, it would be\r\neasy to secure every concession which the safety or the dignity of Rome\r\nmight require from the most formidable barbarians. Instead of exposing\r\nhis person and his legions to the arrows of the Parthians, he obtained,\r\nby an honorable treaty, the restitution of the standards and prisoners\r\nwhich had been taken in the defeat of Crassus.\r\n\r\nHis generals, in the early part of his reign, attempted the reduction of\r\n\xc3\x86thiopia and Arabia Felix. They marched near a thousand miles to the\r\nsouth of the tropic; but the heat of the climate soon repelled the\r\ninvaders, and protected the unwarlike natives of those sequestered\r\nregions. The northern countries of Europe scarcely deserved the expense\r\nand labor of conquest. The forests and morasses of Germany were filled\r\nwith a hardy race of barbarians, who despised life when it was separated\r\nfrom freedom; and though, on the first attack, they seemed to yield to\r\nthe weight of the Roman power, they soon, by a signal act of despair,\r\nregained their independence, and reminded Augustus of the vicissitude of\r\nfortune. On the death of that emperor, his testament was publicly read\r\nin the senate. He bequeathed, as a valuable legacy to his successors,\r\nthe advice of confining the empire within those limits which nature\r\nseemed to have placed as its permanent bulwarks and boundaries: on the\r\nwest the Atlantic Ocean; the Rhine and Danube on the north; the\r\nEuphrates on the east; and towards the south, the sandy deserts of\r\nArabia and Africa.\r\n\r\nHappily for the repose of mankind, the moderate system recommended by\r\nthe wisdom of Augustus was adopted by the fears and vices of his\r\nimmediate successors. Engaged in the pursuit of pleasure, or in the\r\nexercise of tyranny, the first C\xc3\xa6sars seldom showed themselves to the\r\narmies or to the provinces; nor were they disposed to suffer that those\r\ntriumphs which _their_ indolence neglected should be usurped by the\r\nconduct and valor of their lieutenants. The military fame of a subject\r\nwas considered as an insolent invasion of the imperial prerogative; and\r\nit became the duty, as well as interest, of every Roman general to guard\r\nthe frontiers intrusted to his care, without aspiring to conquests\r\nwhich might have proved no less fatal to himself than to the vanquished\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\nThe only accession which the Roman empire received during the first\r\ncentury of the Christian era was the province of Britain. In this single\r\ninstance the successors of C\xc3\xa6sar and Augustus were persuaded to follow\r\nthe example of the former, rather than the precept of the latter. The\r\nproximity of its situation to the coast of Gaul seemed to invite their\r\narms; the pleasing, though doubtful, intelligence of a pearl-fishery\r\nattracted their avarice; and as Britain was viewed in the light of a\r\ndistinct and insulated world, the conquest scarcely formed any exception\r\nto the general system of continental measures. After a war of about\r\nforty years, undertaken by the most stupid, maintained by the most\r\ndissolute, and terminated by the most timid of all the emperors, the far\r\ngreater part of the island submitted to the Roman yoke. The various\r\ntribes of Britons possessed valor without conduct, and the love of\r\nfreedom without the spirit of union. They took up arms with savage\r\nfierceness; they laid them down, or turned them against each other, with\r\nwild inconstancy; and while they fought singly, they were successively\r\nsubdued. Neither the fortitude of Caractacus, nor the despair of\r\nBoadicea, nor the fanaticism of the Druids, could avert the slavery of\r\ntheir country, or resist the steady progress of the imperial generals,\r\nwho maintained the national glory, when the throne was disgraced by the\r\nweakest or the most vicious of mankind. At the very time when Domitian,\r\nconfined to his palace, felt the terrors which he inspired, his legions,\r\nunder the command of the virtuous Agricola, defeated the collected force\r\nof the Caledonians at the foot of the Grampian hills; and his fleets,\r\nventuring to explore an unknown and dangerous navigation, displayed the\r\nRoman arms round every part of the island. The conquest of Britain was\r\nconsidered as already achieved; and it was the design of Agricola to\r\ncomplete and insure his success by the easy reduction of Ireland, for\r\nwhich, in his opinion, one legion and a few auxiliaries were sufficient.\r\nThe western isle might be improved into a valuable possession, and the\r\nBritons would wear their chains with the less reluctance, if the\r\nprospect and example of freedom was on every side removed from before\r\ntheir eyes.\r\n\r\nBut the superior merit of Agricola soon occasioned his removal from the\r\ngovernment of Britain; and forever disappointed this rational, though\r\nextensive, scheme of conquest. Before his departure the prudent general\r\nhad provided for security as well as for dominion. He had observed that\r\nthe island is almost divided into two unequal parts by the opposite\r\ngulfs, or, as they are now called, the Friths of Scotland. Across the\r\nnarrow interval of about forty miles he had drawn a line of military\r\nstations, which was afterwards fortified, in the reign of Antoninus\r\nPius, by a turf rampart, erected on foundations of stone. This wall of\r\nAntoninus, at a small distance beyond the modern cities of Edinburgh and\r\nGlasgow, was fixed as the limit of the Roman province. The native\r\nCaledonians preserved, in the northern extremity of the island, their\r\nwild independence, for which they were not less indebted to their\r\npoverty than to their valor. Their incursions were frequently repelled\r\nand chastised, but their country was never subdued. The masters of the\r\nfairest and most wealthy climates of the globe turned with contempt from\r\ngloomy hills assailed by the winter tempest, from lakes concealed in a\r\nblue mist, and from cold and lonely heaths, over which the deer of the\r\nforest were chased by a troop of naked barbarians.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the Roman frontiers, and such the maxims of\r\nimperial policy, from the death of Augustus to the accession of Trajan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV. ON THE ATTACKS UPON HIS PENSION.[F]\r\n\r\nEDMUND BURKE.--1729-1797.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one thing I can excuse the Duke of Bedford for his attack upon me and\r\nmy mortuary pension: He cannot readily comprehend the transaction he\r\ncondemns. What I have obtained was the fruit of no bargain, the\r\nproduction of no intrigue, the result of no compromise, the effect of no\r\nsolicitation. The first suggestion of it never came from me, mediately\r\nor immediately, to his Majesty or any of his ministers. It was long\r\nknown that the instant my engagements would permit it, and before the\r\nheaviest of all calamities had forever condemned me to obscurity and\r\nsorrow, I had resolved on a total retreat. I had executed that design. I\r\nwas entirely out of the way of serving or of hurting any statesman or\r\nany party, when the ministers so generously and so nobly carried into\r\neffect the spontaneous bounty of the crown. Both descriptions have acted\r\nas became them. When I could no longer serve them, the ministers have\r\nconsidered my situation. When I could no longer hurt them, the\r\nrevolutionists have trampled on my infirmity. My gratitude, I trust, is\r\nequal to the manner in which the benefit was conferred. It came to me,\r\nindeed, at a time of life, and in a state of mind and body, in which no\r\ncircumstance of fortune could afford me any real pleasure. But this was\r\nno fault in the royal donor, or in his ministers, who were pleased, in\r\nacknowledging the merits of an invalid servant of the public, to assuage\r\nthe sorrows of a desolate old man....\r\n\r\nI was not like his Grace of Bedford, swaddled, and rocked, and dandled\r\ninto a legislator: "_Nitor in adversum_" is the motto for a man like me.\r\nI possessed not one of the qualities, nor cultivated one of the arts,\r\nthat recommend men to the favor and protection of the great. I was not\r\nmade for a minion or a tool. As little did I follow the trade of winning\r\nthe hearts by imposing on the understandings of the people. At every\r\nstep of my progress in life--for in every step was I traversed and\r\nopposed--and at every turnpike I met, I was obliged to shew my passport,\r\nand again and again to prove my sole title to the honor of being useful\r\nto my country, by a proof that I was not wholly unacquainted with its\r\nlaws, and the whole system of its interests both abroad and at home.\r\nOtherwise, no rank, no toleration even, for me. I had no arts but manly\r\narts. On them I have stood, and, please God, in spite of the Duke of\r\nBedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to the last gasp will I stand....\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bedford conceives that he is obliged to call the attention\r\nof the House of Peers to his Majesty\'s grant to me, which he considers\r\nas excessive and out of all bounds.\r\n\r\nI know not how it has happened, but it really seems, that, whilst his\r\nGrace was meditating his well-considered censure upon me, he fell into a\r\nsort of sleep. Homer nods, and the Duke of Bedford may dream; and as\r\ndreams--even his golden dreams--are apt to be ill-pieced and\r\nincongruously put together, his Grace preserved his idea of reproach to\r\n_me_, but took the subject-matter from the crown grants to _his own\r\nfamily_. This is "the stuff of which his dreams are made." In that way\r\nof putting things together, his Grace is perfectly in the right. The\r\ngrants to the house of Russell were so enormous, as not only to outrage\r\neconomy, but even to stagger credibility. The Duke of Bedford is the\r\nleviathan among all the creatures of the crown. He tumbles about his\r\nunwieldy bulk; he plays and frolics in the ocean of the royal bounty.\r\nHuge as he is, and whilst "he lies floating many a rood," he is still a\r\ncreature. His ribs, his fins, his whalebone, his blubber, the very\r\nspiracles through which he spouts a torrent of brine against his origin,\r\nand covers me all over with the spray--everything of him and about him\r\nis from the throne. Is it for _him_ to question the dispensation of the\r\nroyal favor?\r\n\r\nI really am at a loss to draw any sort of parallel between the public\r\nmerits of his Grace, by which he justifies the grants he holds, and\r\nthese services of mine, on the favorable construction of which I have\r\nobtained what his Grace so much disapproves. In private life I have not\r\nat all the honor of acquaintance with the noble Duke; but I ought to\r\npresume, and it costs me nothing to do so, that he abundantly deserves\r\nthe esteem and love of all who live with him. But as to public service,\r\nwhy, truly, it would not be more ridiculous for me to compare myself, in\r\nrank, in fortune, in splendid descent, in youth, strength, or figure,\r\nwith the Duke of Bedford, than to make a parallel between his services\r\nand my attempts to be useful to my country. It would not be gross\r\nadulation, but uncivil irony, to say that he has any public merit of his\r\nown to keep alive the idea of the services by which his vast landed\r\npensions were obtained. My merits, whatever they are, are original and\r\npersonal: his are derivative. It is his ancestor, the original\r\npensioner, that has laid up this inexhaustible fund of merit, which\r\nmakes his Grace so very delicate and exceptious about the merit of all\r\nother grantees of the crown. Had he permitted me to remain in quiet, I\r\nshould have said: "\'Tis his estate; that\'s enough. It is his by law;\r\nwhat have I to do with it or its history?" He would naturally have said\r\non his side: "\'Tis this man\'s fortune. He is as good now as my ancestor\r\nwas two hundred and fifty years ago. I am a young man with very old\r\npensions: he is an old man with very young pensions--that\'s all."\r\n\r\nWhy will his Grace, by attacking me, force me reluctantly to compare my\r\nlittle merit with that which obtained from the crown those prodigies of\r\nprofuse donation by which he tramples on the mediocrity of humble and\r\nlaborious individuals?... Since the new grantees have war made on them\r\nby the old, and that the word of the sovereign is not to be taken, let\r\nus turn our eyes to history, in which great men have always a pleasure\r\nin contemplating the heroic origin of their house.\r\n\r\nThe first peer of the name, the first purchaser of the grants, was a Mr.\r\nRussell, a person of an ancient gentleman\'s family, raised by being a\r\nminion of Henry the Eighth. As there generally is some resemblance of\r\ncharacter to create these relations, the favorite was in all likelihood\r\nmuch such another as his master. The first of those immoderate grants\r\nwas not taken from the ancient demesne of the crown, but from the recent\r\nconfiscation of the ancient nobility of the land. The lion, having\r\nsucked the blood of his prey, threw the offal carcass to the jackal in\r\nwaiting. Having tasted once the food of confiscation, the favorites\r\nbecame fierce and ravenous. This worthy favorite\'s first grant was from\r\nthe lay nobility. The second, infinitely improving on the enormity of\r\nthe first, was from the plunder of the church. In truth, his Grace is\r\nsomewhat excusable for his dislike to a grant like mine, not only in its\r\nquantity, but in its kind, so different from his own.\r\n\r\nMine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign: his, from Henry the\r\nEighth. Mine had not its fund in the murder of any innocent person of\r\nillustrious rank, or in the pillage of any body of unoffending men: his\r\ngrants were from the aggregate and consolidated funds of judgments\r\niniquitously legal, and from possessions voluntarily surrendered by the\r\nlawful proprietors with the gibbet at their door.\r\n\r\nThe merit of the grantee whom he derives from, was that of being a\r\nprompt and greedy instrument of a levelling tyrant, who oppressed all\r\ndescriptions of his people, but who fell with particular fury on\r\neverything that was great and noble. Mine has been in endeavoring to\r\nscreen every man, in every class, from oppression, and particularly in\r\ndefending the high and eminent, who, in the bad times of confiscating\r\nprinces, confiscating chief-governors, or confiscating demagogues, are\r\nthe most exposed to jealousy, avarice, and envy.\r\n\r\nThe merit of the original grantee of his Grace\'s pensions was in giving\r\nhis hand to the work, and partaking the spoil with a prince who\r\nplundered a part of the national church of his time and country. Mine\r\nwas in defending the whole of the national church of my own time and my\r\nown country, and the whole of the national churches of all countries,\r\nfrom the principles and the examples which lead to ecclesiastical\r\npillage, thence to a contempt of _all_ prescriptive titles, thence to\r\nthe pillage of _all_ property, and thence to universal desolation.\r\n\r\nThe merit of the origin of his Grace\'s fortune was in being a favorite\r\nand chief adviser to a prince who left no liberty to his native country.\r\nMy endeavor was to obtain liberty for the municipal country in which I\r\nwas born, and for all descriptions and denominations in it. Mine was to\r\nsupport, with unrelaxing vigilance, every right, every privilege, every\r\nfranchise, in this my adopted, my dearer, and more comprehensive\r\ncountry; and not only to preserve those rights in this chief seat of\r\nempire, but in every nation, in every land, in every climate, language,\r\nand religion, in the vast domain that still is under the protection, and\r\nthe larger that was once under the protection, of the British crown.\r\n\r\nHis founder\'s merits were, by arts in which he served his master and\r\nmade his fortune, to bring poverty, wretchedness, and depopulation on\r\nhis country. Mine were under a benevolent prince, in promoting the\r\ncommerce, manufactures, and agriculture of his kingdom.\r\n\r\nHis founder\'s merit was the merit of a gentleman raised by the arts of a\r\ncourt and the protection of a Wolsey to the eminence of a great and\r\npotent lord. His merit in that eminence was, by instigating a tyrant to\r\ninjustice, to provoke a people to rebellion. My merit was, to awaken the\r\nsober part of the country, that they might put themselves on their\r\nguard against any one potent lord, or any greater number of potent\r\nlords, or any combination of great leading men of any sort, if ever they\r\nshould attempt to proceed in the same courses, but in the reverse\r\norder,--that is, by instigating a corrupted populace to rebellion, and,\r\nthrough that rebellion, introducing a tyranny yet worse than the tyranny\r\nwhich his Grace\'s ancestor supported, and of which he profited in the\r\nmanner we behold in the despotism of Henry the Eighth.\r\n\r\nThe political merit of the first pensioner of his Grace\'s house was that\r\nof being concerned as a counsellor of state in advising, and in his\r\nperson executing, the conditions of a dishonorable peace with\r\nFrance,--the surrendering of the fortress of Boulogne, then our outguard\r\non the Continent. By that surrender, Calais, the key of France, and the\r\nbridle in the mouth of that power, was not many years afterwards finally\r\nlost. My merit has been in resisting the power and pride of France,\r\nunder any form of its rule; but in opposing it with the greatest zeal\r\nand earnestness, when that rule appeared in the worst form it could\r\nassume,--the worst, indeed, which the prime cause and principle of all\r\nevil could possibly give it. It was my endeavor by every means to excite\r\na spirit in the House, where I had the honor of a seat, for carrying on\r\nwith early vigor and decision the most clearly just and necessary war\r\nthat this or any nation ever carried on, in order to save my country\r\nfrom the iron yoke of its power, and from the more dreadful contagion of\r\nits principles,--to preserve, while they can be preserved, pure and\r\nuntainted, the ancient, inbred integrity, piety, good-nature, and\r\ngood-humor of the people of England, from the dreadful pestilence\r\nwhich, beginning in France, threatens to lay waste the whole moral and\r\nin a great degree the whole physical world, having done both in the\r\nfocus of its most intense malignity.\r\n\r\nThe labors of his Grace\'s founder merited the "curses, not loud, but\r\ndeep," of the Commons of England, on whom _he_ and his master had\r\neffected a _complete Parliamentary Reform_, by making them, in their\r\nslavery and humiliation, the true and adequate representatives of a\r\ndebased, degraded, and undone people. My merits were in having had an\r\nactive, though not always an ostentatious share, in every one act,\r\nwithout exception, of undisputed constitutional utility in my time, and\r\nin having supported, on all occasions, the authority, the efficiency,\r\nand the privileges of the Commons of Great Britain. I ended my services\r\nby a recorded and fully reasoned assertion on their own journals of\r\ntheir constitutional rights, and a vindication of their constitutional\r\nconduct. I labored in all things to merit their inward approbation, and\r\n(along with the assistants of the largest, the greatest, and best of my\r\nendeavors) I received their free, unbiased, public, and solemn thanks.\r\n\r\nThus stands the account of the comparative merits of the crown grants\r\nwhich compose the Duke of Bedford\'s fortune, as balanced against mine.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[F] _From_ "A LETTER TO A NOBLE LORD, _on the attacks made upon Mr.\r\nBurke and his Pension, in the House of Lords, by the Duke of Bedford\r\nand the Earl of Lauderdale, early in the Present Session of\r\nParliament." 1796._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _England, with all thy faults, I love thee still,\r\n    My country! and, while yet a nook is left\r\n    Where English minds and manners may be found,\r\n    Shall be constrain\'d to love thee.

TWO EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SCENES.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM COWPER.--1731-1800.\r\n\r\n_From letters to the Rev. John Newton._\r\n\r\n\r\nNov. 17th, 1783.\r\n\r\n... Since our conflagration here, we have sent two women and a boy to\r\nthe justice, for depredation; S. R. for stealing a piece of beef, which,\r\nin her excuse, she said she intended to take care of. This lady, whom\r\nyou well remember, escaped for want of evidence; not that evidence was\r\nwanting, but our men of Gotham judged it unnecessary to send it. With\r\nher went the woman I mentioned before, who, it seems, has made some sort\r\nof profession, but upon this occasion allowed herself a latitude of\r\nconduct rather inconsistent with it, having filled her apron with\r\nwearing-apparel, which she likewise intended to take care of. She would\r\nhave gone to the county gaol, had William Raban, the baker\'s son, who\r\nprosecuted, insisted upon it; but he, good-naturedly, though I think\r\nweakly, interposed in her favor, and begged her off. The young gentleman\r\nwho accompanied these fair ones is the junior son of Molly Boswell. He\r\nhad stolen some iron-work, the property of Griggs the butcher. Being\r\nconvicted, he was ordered to be whipped, which operation he underwent at\r\nthe cart\'s tail, from the stone-house to the high arch, and back again.\r\nHe seemed to show great fortitude, but it was all an imposition upon the\r\npublic. The beadle, who performed it, had filled his left hand with\r\nyellow ochre, through which, after every stroke, he drew the lash of his\r\nwhip, leaving the appearance of a wound upon the skin, but in reality\r\nnot hurting him at all. This being perceived by Mr. Constable H., who\r\nfollowed the beadle, he applied his cane, without any such management or\r\nprecaution, to the shoulders of the too merciful executioner. The scene\r\nimmediately became more interesting. The beadle could by no means be\r\nprevailed upon to strike hard, which provoked the constable to strike\r\nharder; and this double flogging continued, till a lass of Silver-End,\r\npitying the pitiful beadle thus suffering under the hands of the\r\npitiless constable, joined the procession, and placing herself\r\nimmediately behind the latter, seized him by his capillary club,\r\nand pulling him backwards by the same, slapped his face with a most\r\nAmazon fury. This concatenation of events has taken up more of my\r\npaper than I intended it should, but I could not forbear to inform\r\nyou how the beadle thrashed the thief, the constable the beadle, and\r\nthe lady the constable, and how the thief was the only person concerned\r\nwho suffered nothing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch 29th, 1784.\r\n\r\nIt being his Majesty\'s pleasure, that I should yet have another\r\nopportunity to write before he dissolves the Parliament, I avail myself\r\nof it with all possible alacrity. I thank you for your last, which was\r\nnot the less welcome for coming, like an extraordinary gazette, at a\r\ntime when it was not expected.\r\n\r\nAs when the sea is uncommonly agitated, the water finds its way into\r\ncreeks and holes of rocks, which in its calmer state it never reaches,\r\nin like manner the effect of these turbulent times is felt even at\r\nOrchard Side, where in general we live as undisturbed by the political\r\nelement as shrimps or cockles that have been accidentally deposited in\r\nsome hollow beyond the water-mark, by the usual dashing of the waves.\r\nWe were sitting yesterday after dinner, the two ladies and myself, very\r\ncomposedly, and without the least apprehension of any such intrusion in\r\nour snug parlor, one lady knitting, the other netting, and the gentleman\r\nwinding worsted, when to our unspeakable surprise a mob appeared before\r\nthe window; a smart rap was heard at the door, the boys bellowed, and\r\nthe maid announced Mr. Grenville. Puss was unfortunately let out of her\r\nbox, so that the candidate, with all his good friends at his heels, was\r\nrefused admittance at the grand entry, and referred to the back door, as\r\nthe only possible way of approach.\r\n\r\nCandidates are creatures not very susceptible of affronts, and would\r\nrather, I suppose, climb in at the window, than be absolutely excluded.\r\nIn a minute, the yard, the kitchen, and the parlor were filled. Mr.\r\nGrenville, advancing toward me, shook me by the hand with a degree of\r\ncordiality that was extremely seducing. As soon as he, and as many more\r\nas could find chairs, were seated, he began to open the intent of his\r\nvisit. I told him I had no vote, for which he readily gave me credit. I\r\nassured him I had no influence, which he was not equally inclined to\r\nbelieve, and the less, no doubt, because Mr. Ashburner, the draper,\r\naddressing himself to me at this moment, informed me that I had a great\r\ndeal. Supposing that I could not be possessed of such a treasure without\r\nknowing it, I ventured to affirm my first assertion, by saying, that if\r\nI had any I was utterly at a loss to imagine where it could be, or\r\nwherein it consisted. Thus ended the conference. Mr. Grenville squeezed\r\nme by the hand again, kissed the ladies, and withdrew. He kissed\r\nlikewise the maid in the kitchen, and seemed upon the whole a most\r\nloving, kissing, kind-hearted gentleman. He is very young, genteel, and\r\nhandsome. He has a pair of very good eyes in his head, which not being\r\nsufficient, as it should seem, for the many nice and difficult purposes\r\nof a senator, he has a third also, which he suspended from his\r\nbuttonhole. The boys halloo\'d, the dogs barked, puss scampered, the\r\nhero, with his long train of obsequious followers, withdrew. We made\r\nourselves very merry with the adventure, and in a short time settled\r\ninto our former tranquillity, never probably to be thus interrupted\r\nmore. I thought myself, however, happy in being able to affirm truly\r\nthat I had not that influence for which he sued; and which, had I been\r\npossessed of it, with my present views of the dispute between the Crown\r\nand the Commons, I must have refused him, for he is on the side of the\r\nformer. It is comfortable to be of no consequence in a world where one\r\ncannot exercise any without disobliging somebody. The town, however,\r\nseems to be much at his service, and if he be equally successful\r\nthroughout the country, he will undoubtedly gain his election. Mr.\r\nAshburner, perhaps, was a little mortified, because it was evident I\r\nowed the honor of this visit to his misrepresentation of my importance.\r\nBut had he thought proper to assure Mr. Grenville that I had three\r\nheads, I should not, I suppose, have been bound to produce them....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast,\r\n    Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round,\r\n    And while the bubbling and loud hissing urn\r\n    Throws up a steamy column, and the cups\r\n    That cheer but not inebriate wait on each,\r\n    So let us welcome peaceful evening in._\r\n\r\n        COWPER.--_The Winter Evening_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII. FROM "THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL."[G]\r\n\r\nRICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN.--1751-1816.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE.--_A Room in_ SIR PETER TEAZLE\'S _House._\r\n\r\n_Enter_ SIR PETER TEAZLE.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ When an old bachelor marries a young wife, what is he to\r\nexpect? \'Tis now six months since Lady Teazle made me the happiest of\r\nmen--and I have been the most miserable dog ever since. We tiffed a\r\nlittle going to church, and fairly quarrelled before the bells had done\r\nringing. I was more than once nearly choked with gall during the\r\nhoneymoon, and had lost all comfort in life before my friends had done\r\nwishing me joy. Yet I chose with caution--a girl bred wholly in the\r\ncountry, who never knew luxury beyond one silk gown, nor dissipation\r\nabove the annual gala of a race ball. Yet she now plays her part in all\r\nthe extravagant fopperies of fashion and the town with as ready a grace\r\nas if she never had seen a bush or a grass-plot out of Grosvenor Square!\r\nI am sneered at by all my acquaintance, and paragraphed in the\r\nnewspapers. She dissipates my fortune, and contradicts all my humors;\r\nyet the worst of it is, I doubt I love her, or I should never bear all\r\nthis. However, I\'ll never be weak enough to own it. But I meet with\r\nnothing but crosses and vexations--and the fault is entirely hers. I am,\r\nmyself, the sweetest-tempered man alive, and hate a teasing temper; and\r\nso I tell her a hundred times a day.--Ay! and what is very\r\nextraordinary, in all our disputes she is always in the wrong. But Lady\r\nSneerwell, and the set she meets at her house, encourage the\r\nperverseness of her disposition. Then, to complete my vexation, Maria,\r\nmy ward, whom I ought to have the power of a father over, is determined\r\nto turn rebel too, and absolutely refuses the man whom I have long\r\nresolved on for her husband--\r\n\r\n_Enter_ LADY TEAZLE.\r\n\r\nLady Teazle, Lady Teazle, I\'ll not bear it!\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Sir Peter, Sir Peter, you may bear it or not, as you\r\nplease; but I ought to have my own way in everything, and, what\'s more,\r\nI will too. What! though I was educated in the country, I know very well\r\nthat women of fashion in London are accountable to nobody after they are\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Very well, ma\'am, very well; so a husband is to have no\r\ninfluence, no authority?\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Authority! No, to be sure. If you wanted authority over me,\r\nyou should have adopted me, and not married me: I am sure you were old\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Old enough!--ay, there it is. Well, well, Lady Teazle, though\r\nmy life may be made unhappy by your temper, I\'ll not be ruined by your\r\nextravagance!\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ My extravagance! I\'m sure I\'m not more extravagant than a\r\nwoman of fashion ought to be.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ No, no, madam, you shall throw away no more sums on such\r\nunmeaning luxury. Such wastefulness! to spend as much to furnish your\r\ndressing-room with flowers in winter as would suffice to turn the\r\nPantheon into a greenhouse, and give a _f\xc3\xaate champ\xc3\xaatre_ at Christmas.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ And am I to blame, Sir Peter, because flowers are dear in\r\ncold weather? You should find fault with the climate, and not with me.\r\nFor my part, I\'m sure I wish it was spring all the year round, and that\r\nroses grew under our feet.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Oons! madam--if you had been born to this, I shouldn\'t wonder\r\nat your talking thus; but you forget what your situation was when I\r\nmarried you.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ No, no, I don\'t; \'twas a very disagreeable one, or I should\r\nnever have married you.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Yes, yes, madam, you were then in somewhat a humbler\r\nstyle--the daughter of a plain country squire. Recollect, Lady Teazle,\r\nwhen I saw you first sitting at your tambour, in a pretty figured linen\r\ngown, with a bunch of keys at your side, your hair combed smooth over a\r\nroll, and your apartment hung round with fruits in worsted, of your own\r\nworking.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Oh, yes! I remember it very well, and a curious life I led.\r\nMy daily occupation--to inspect the dairy, superintend the poultry, make\r\nextracts from the family receipt-book, and comb my aunt Deborah\'s\r\nlap-dog.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Yes, yes, ma\'am, \'twas so indeed.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ And then you know my evening amusements! To draw patterns\r\nfor ruffles, which I had not materials to make up; to play Pope Joan\r\nwith the curate; to read a sermon to my aunt; or to be stuck down to an\r\nold spinet to strum my father to sleep after a fox-chase.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ I am glad you have so good a memory. Yes, madam, these were\r\nthe recreations I took you from; but now you must have your\r\ncoach--_vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_--and three powdered footmen before your chair; and,\r\nin the summer, a pair of white cats to draw you to Kensington Gardens.\r\nNo recollection, I suppose, when you were content to ride double, behind\r\nthe butler, on a docked coach-horse.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ No--I vow I never did that: I deny the butler and the\r\ncoach-horse.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ This, madam, was your situation; and what have I done for\r\nyou? I have made you a woman of fashion, of fortune, of rank--in short,\r\nI have made you my wife.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Well, then, and there is but one thing more you can make me\r\nto add to the obligation, that is----\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ My widow, I suppose?\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Hem! hem!\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ I thank you, madam--but don\'t flatter yourself; for, though\r\nyour ill conduct may disturb my peace of mind, it shall never break my\r\nheart, I promise you: however, I am equally obliged to you for the hint.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Then why will you endeavor to make yourself so disagreeable\r\nto me, and thwart me in every little elegant expense?\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Madam, I say, had you any of these little elegant expenses\r\nwhen you married me?\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Sir Peter! would you have me be out of the fashion?\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ The fashion, indeed! what had you to do with the fashion\r\nbefore you married me?\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ For my part, I should think you would like to have your\r\nwife thought a woman of taste.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Ay--there again--taste! Zounds! madam, you had no taste when\r\nyou married me!\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ That\'s very true, indeed, Sir Peter! and after having\r\nmarried you, I should never pretend to taste again, I allow. But now,\r\nSir Peter, since we have finished our daily jangle, I presume I may go\r\nto my engagement at Lady Sneerwell\'s.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Ay, there\'s another precious circumstance--a charming set of\r\nacquaintances you have made there!\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Nay, Sir Peter, they are all people of rank and fortune,\r\nand remarkably tenacious of reputation.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Yes, they are tenacious of reputation with a vengeance; for\r\nthey don\'t choose anybody should have a character but themselves! Such a\r\ncrew! Ah! many a wretch has rid on a hurdle who has done less mischief\r\nthan these utterers of forged tales; coiners of scandal, and clippers of\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ What, would you restrain the freedom of speech?\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Ah! they have made you just as bad as any one of the society.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Why, I believe I do bear a part with a tolerable grace.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Grace, indeed!\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ But I vow I bear no malice against the people I abuse; when\r\nI say an ill-natured thing, \'tis out of pure good humor; and I take it\r\nfor granted they deal exactly in the same manner with me. But, Sir\r\nPeter, you know you promised to come to Lady Sneerwell\'s too.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Well, well, I\'ll call in, just to look after my own\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Then, indeed, you must make haste after me, or you\'ll be\r\ntoo late. So good-bye to ye.      [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ So--I have gained much by my intended expostulation! Yet with\r\nwhat a charming air she contradicts everything I say; and how pleasantly\r\nshe shows her contempt for my authority! Well, though I can\'t make her\r\nlove me; there is great satisfaction in quarrelling with her; and I\r\nthink she never appears to such advantage as when she is doing\r\neverything in her power to plague me.      [_Exit_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE.--_A room in_ LADY SNEERWELL\'S _House._\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL, MRS. CANDOUR, CRABTREE, SIR BENJAMIN BACKBITE, _and_\r\nJOSEPH SURFACE, _discovered_.\r\n\r\n_Enter_ LADY TEAZLE _and_ MARIA.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sneer._ Lady Teazle, I hope we shall see Sir Peter?\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ I believe he\'ll wait on your ladyship presently.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sneer._ Maria, my love, you look grave. Come, you shall sit down\r\nto piquet with Mr. Surface.\r\n\r\n_Mar._ I take very little pleasure in cards--however, I\'ll do as your\r\nladyship pleases.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ Now I\'ll die; but you are so scandalous, I\'ll forswear your\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ What\'s the matter, Mrs. Candour?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ They\'ll not allow our friend Miss Vermillion to be handsome.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sneer._ Oh, surely she is a pretty woman.\r\n\r\n_Crab._ I am very glad you think so, ma\'am.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ She has a charming fresh color.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Yes, when it is fresh put on.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ Oh, fie! Her color is natural: I have seen it come and go!\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ I dare say you have, ma\'am: it goes off at night, and comes\r\nagain in the morning.\r\n\r\n_Sir Ben._ True, ma\'am, it not only comes and goes; but, what\'s more,\r\nher maid can fetch and carry it!\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ Ha! ha! ha! how I hate to hear you talk so! But surely now,\r\nher sister is, or was, very handsome.\r\n\r\n_Crab._ Who? Mrs. Evergreen? Oh! she\'s six-and-fifty if she\'s an hour!\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ Now positively you wrong her; fifty-two or fifty-three is\r\nthe utmost--and I don\'t think she looks more.\r\n\r\n_Sir Ben._ Ah! there\'s no judging by her looks, unless one could see her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sneer._ Well, well, if Mrs. Evergreen does take some pains to\r\nrepair the ravages of time, you must allow she effects it with great\r\ningenuity; and surely that\'s better than the careless manner in which\r\nthe widow Ochre caulks her wrinkles.\r\n\r\n_Sir Ben._ Nay, now, Lady Sneerwell, you are severe upon the widow.\r\nCome, come, \'tis not that she paints so ill--but, when she has finished\r\nher face, she joins it on so badly to her neck, that she looks like a\r\nmended statue, in which the connoisseur may see at once that the head is\r\nmodern, though the trunk\'s antique.\r\n\r\n_Crab._ Ha! ha! ha! Well said, nephew!\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ Ha! ha! ha! Well, you make me laugh; but I vow I hate you\r\nfor it. What do you think of Miss Simper?\r\n\r\n_Sir Ben._ Why, she has very pretty teeth.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Yes, and on that account, when she is neither speaking nor\r\nlaughing (which very seldom happens), she never absolutely shuts her\r\nmouth, but leaves it always on a-jar, as it were--thus.\r\n\r\n[_Shows her teeth._\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ How can you be so ill-natured?\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Nay, I allow even that\'s better than the pains Mrs. Prim\r\ntakes to conceal her losses in front. She draws her mouth till it\r\npositively resembles the aperture of a poor\'s-box, and all her words\r\nappear to slide out edgewise as it were--thus: _How do you do, madam?\r\nYes, madam._      [_Mimics._\r\n\r\n_Lady Sneer._ Very well, Lady Teazle; I see you can be a little severe.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ In defence of a friend it is but justice. But here comes\r\nSir Peter to spoil our pleasantry.\r\n\r\n_Enter_ SIR PETER TEAZLE.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Ladies, your most obedient.--[_Aside,_] Mercy on me, here is\r\nthe whole set! a character dead at every word, I suppose.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ I am rejoiced you are come, Sir Peter. They have been so\r\ncensorious--and Lady Teazle as bad as any one.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ That must be very distressing to you, indeed, Mrs. Candour.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ Oh, they will allow good qualities to nobody: not even good\r\nnature to our friend Mrs. Pursy.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ What, the fat dowager who was at Mrs. Quadrille\'s last\r\nnight?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ Nay, her bulk is her misfortune; and, when she takes so much\r\npains to get rid of it, you ought not to reflect on her.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sneer._ That\'s very true, indeed.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Yes, I know she almost lives on acids and small whey; laces\r\nherself by pulleys; and often, in the hottest noon in summer, you may\r\nsee her on a little squat pony, with her hair plaited up behind like a\r\ndrummer\'s, and puffing round the ring on a full trot.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ I thank you, Lady Teazle, for defending her.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Yes, a good defence, truly.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ Truly, Lady Teazle is as censorious as Miss Sallow.\r\n\r\n_Crab._ Yes, and she is a curious being to pretend to be censorious--an\r\nawkward thing, without any one good point under the sun.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ Positively you shall not be so very severe. Miss Sallow is a\r\nnear relation of mine by marriage, and, as for her person, great\r\nallowance is to be made; for, let me tell you, a woman labors under many\r\ndisadvantages who tries to pass for a girl of six-and-thirty.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sneer._ Though, surely, she is handsome still--and for the\r\nweakness in her eyes, considering how much she reads by candlelight, it\r\nis not to be wondered at.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ True, and then as to her manner; upon my word I think it is\r\nparticularly graceful, considering she never had the least education;\r\nfor you know her mother was a Welsh milliner, and her father a\r\nsugar-baker at Bristol.\r\n\r\n_Sir Ben._ Ah! you are both of you too good-natured!\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Yes, distressingly good-natured! This their own relation!\r\nMercy on me!      [_Aside._\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ For my part, I own I cannot bear to hear a friend ill-spoken\r\nof.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ No, to be sure!\r\n\r\n_Sir Ben._ Oh! you are of a moral turn. Mrs. Candour and I can sit for\r\nan hour and hear Lady Stucco talk sentiment.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teas._ Nay, I vow Lady Stucco is very well with the dessert after\r\ndinner; for she\'s just like the French fruit one cracks for\r\nmottoes--made up of paint and proverb.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ Well, I will never join in ridiculing a friend; and so I\r\nconstantly tell my cousin Ogle, and you all know what pretensions she\r\nhas to be critical on beauty.\r\n\r\n_Crab._ Oh, to be sure! she has herself the oddest countenance that ever\r\nwas seen; \'tis a collection of features from all the different countries\r\nof the globe.\r\n\r\n_Sir Ben._ So she has, indeed--an Irish front----\r\n\r\n_Crab._ Caledonian locks----\r\n\r\n_Sir Ben._ Dutch nose----\r\n\r\n_Crab._ Austrian lips----\r\n\r\n_Sir Ben._ Complexion of a Spaniard----\r\n\r\n_Crab._ And teeth _\xc3\xa0 la Chinoise_.\r\n\r\n_Sir Ben._ In short, her face resembles a _table d\'h\xc3\xb4te_ at Spa--where\r\nno two guests are of a nation----\r\n\r\n_Crab._ Or a congress at the close of a general war--wherein all the\r\nmembers, even to her eyes, appear to have a different interest, and her\r\nnose and chin are the only parties likely to join issue.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ Ha! ha! ha!\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Mercy on my life!--a person they dine with twice a\r\nweek!      [_Aside._\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ Nay, but I vow you shall not carry the laugh off so--for\r\ngive me leave to say that Mrs. Ogle----\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Madam, madam, I beg your pardon--there\'s no stopping these\r\ngood gentlemen\'s tongues. But when I tell you, Mrs. Candour, that the\r\nlady they are abusing is a particular friend of mine, I hope you\'ll not\r\ntake her part.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sneer._ Ha! ha! ha! well said, Sir Peter! but you are a cruel\r\ncreature--too phlegmatic yourself for a jest, and too peevish to allow\r\nwit in others.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Ah, madam, true wit is more nearly allied to good nature than\r\nyour ladyship is aware of.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teas._ True, Sir Peter; I believe they are so near akin that they\r\ncan never be united.\r\n\r\n_Sir Ben._ Or rather, suppose them man and wife, because one seldom sees\r\nthem together.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ But Sir Peter is such an enemy to scandal, I believe he\r\nwould have it put down by parliament.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Positively, madam, if they were to consider the sporting with\r\nreputation of as much importance as poaching on manors, and pass an act\r\nfor the preservation of fame, as well as game, I believe many would\r\nthank them for the bill.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sneer._ Why! Sir Peter; would you deprive us of our privileges?\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Ay, madam; and then no person should be permitted to kill\r\ncharacters and run down reputations but qualified old maids and\r\ndisappointed widows.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sneer._ Go, you monster!\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Can._ But, surely, you would not be quite so severe on those who\r\nonly report what they hear?\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Yes, madam, I would have law merchant for them too; and in\r\nall cases of slander currency, whenever the drawer of the lie was not to\r\nbe found, the injured parties should have a right to come on any of the\r\nindorsers.\r\n\r\n_Crab._ Well, for my part, I believe there never was a scandalous tale\r\nwithout some foundation.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sneer._ Come, ladies, shall we sit down to cards in the next room?\r\n\r\n_Enter_ Servant, _who whispers_ Sir Peter.\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ I\'ll be with them directly.--[_Exit_ SERVANT.] I\'ll get away\r\nunperceived.      [_Aside._\r\n\r\n_Lady Sneer._ Sir Peter, you are not going to leave us?\r\n\r\n_Sir Pet._ Your ladyship must excuse me; I\'m called away by particular\r\nbusiness. But I leave my character behind me.      [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Sir Ben._ Well--certainly, Lady Teazle, that lord of yours is a strange\r\nbeing: I could tell you some stories of him would make you laugh\r\nheartily if he were not your husband.\r\n\r\n_Lady Teaz._ Oh, pray, don\'t mind that; come, do let\'s hear\r\nthem.      [_Exeunt all but_ JOSEPH SURFACE _and_ MARIA.\r\n\r\n_Jos. Surf._ Maria, I see you have no satisfaction in this society.\r\n\r\n_Mar._ How is it possible I should? If to raise malicious smiles at the\r\ninfirmities or misfortunes of those who have never injured us be the\r\nprovince of wit or humor, Heaven grant me a double portion of dulness!\r\n\r\n_Jos. Surf._ Yet they appear more ill-natured than they are; they have\r\nno malice at heart.\r\n\r\n_Mar._ Then is their conduct still more contemptible; for, in my\r\nopinion, nothing could excuse the intemperance of their tongues but a\r\nnatural and uncontrollable bitterness of mind.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[G] For the sake of brevity a part of the first scene has been\r\nexcised.

THE TRIAL BY COMBAT AT THE DIAMOND OF THE DESERT.[I]\r\n\r\n_From_ THE TALISMAN.\r\n\r\nSIR WALTER SCOTT.--1771-1832.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed, on account of the heat of the climate, that the\r\njudicial combat, which was the cause of the present assemblage of\r\nvarious nations at the Diamond of the Desert, should take place at one\r\nhour after sunrise. The wide lists, which had been constructed under the\r\ninspection of the Knight of the Leopard, enclosed a space of hard sand,\r\nwhich was one hundred and twenty yards long by forty in width. They\r\nextended in length from north to south, so as to give both parties the\r\nequal advantage of the rising sun. Saladin\'s royal seat was erected on\r\nthe western side of the enclosure, just in the centre, where the\r\ncombatants were expected to meet in mid encounter. Opposed to this was\r\na gallery with closed casements, so contrived, that the ladies, for\r\nwhose accommodation it was erected, might see the fight without being\r\nthemselves exposed to view. At either extremity of the lists was a\r\nbarrier, which could be opened or shut at pleasure. Thrones had been\r\nalso erected, but the Archduke, perceiving that his was lower than King\r\nRichard\'s, refused to occupy it; and Coeur de Lion, who would have\r\nsubmitted to much ere any formality should have interfered with the\r\ncombat, readily agreed that the sponsors, as they were called, should\r\nremain on horseback during the fight. At one extremity of the lists were\r\nplaced the followers of Richard, and opposed to them were those who\r\naccompanied the defender, Conrade. Around the throne destined for the\r\nSoldan were ranged his splendid Georgian Guards, and the rest of the\r\nenclosure was occupied by Christian and Mohammedan spectators.\r\n\r\nLong before daybreak, the lists were surrounded by even a larger number\r\nof Saracens than Richard had seen on the preceding evening. When the\r\nfirst ray of the sun\'s glorious orb arose above the desert, the sonorous\r\ncall, "To prayer, to prayer!" was poured forth by the Soldan himself,\r\nand answered by others, whose rank and zeal entitled them to act as\r\nmuezzins. It was a striking spectacle to see them all sink to earth, for\r\nthe purpose of repeating their devotions, with their faces turned to\r\nMecca. But when they arose from the ground, the sun\'s rays, now\r\nstrengthening fast, seemed to confirm the Lord of Gilsland\'s conjecture\r\nof the night before. They were flashed back from many a spear-head, for\r\nthe pointless lances of the preceding day were certainly no longer such.\r\nDe Vaux pointed it out to his master, who answered with impatience, that\r\nhe had perfect confidence in the good faith of the Soldan; but if De\r\nVaux was afraid of his bulky body, he might retire.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the noise of timbrels was heard, at the sound of which\r\nthe whole Saracen cavaliers threw themselves from their horses, and\r\nprostrated themselves, as if for a second morning prayer. This was to\r\ngive an opportunity to the Queen, with Edith and her attendants, to pass\r\nfrom the pavilion to the gallery intended for them. Fifty guards of\r\nSaladin\'s seraglio escorted them, with naked sabres, whose orders were,\r\nto cut to pieces whomsoever, were he prince or peasant, should venture\r\nto gaze on the ladies as they passed, or even presume to raise his head\r\nuntil the cessation of the music should make all men aware that they\r\nwere lodged in their gallery, not to be gazed on by the curious eye.\r\n\r\nThis superstitious observance of Oriental reverence to the fair sex\r\ncalled forth from Queen Berengaria some criticisms very unfavorable to\r\nSaladin and his country. But their den, as the royal fair called it,\r\nbeing securely closed and guarded by their sable attendants, she was\r\nunder the necessity of contenting herself with seeing, and laying aside\r\nfor the present the still more exquisite pleasure of being seen.\r\n\r\nMeantime the sponsors of both champions went, as was their duty, to see\r\nthat they were duly armed, and prepared for combat. The Archduke of\r\nAustria was in no hurry to perform this part of the ceremony, having had\r\nrather an unusually severe debauch upon wine of Schiraz the preceding\r\nevening. But the Grand Master of the Temple, more deeply concerned in\r\nthe event of the combat, was early before the tent of Conrade of\r\nMontserrat. To his great surprise, the attendants refused him\r\nadmittance.\r\n\r\n"Do you not know me, ye knaves?" said the Grand Master in great anger.\r\n\r\n"We do, most valiant and reverend," answered Conrade\'s squire; "but even\r\n_you_ may not at present enter--the Marquis is about to confess\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"Confess himself!" exclaimed the Templar, in a tone where alarm mingled\r\nwith surprise and scorn--"and to whom I pray thee?"\r\n\r\n"My master bid me be secret," said the squire; on which the Grand Master\r\npushed past him, and entered the tent almost by force.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Montserrat was kneeling at the feet of the Hermit of\r\nEngaddi, and in the act of beginning his confession.\r\n\r\n"What means this, Marquis?" said the Grand Master, "up, for shame--or,\r\nif you must needs confess, am not I here?"\r\n\r\n"I have confessed to you too often already," replied Conrade, with a\r\npale cheek and a faltering voice. "For God\'s sake, Grand Master, begone,\r\nand let me unfold my conscience to this holy man."\r\n\r\n"In what is he holier than I am?" said the Grand Master.--"Hermit,\r\nprophet, madman--say, if thou darest, in what thou excellest me?"\r\n\r\n"Bold and bad man," replied the Hermit, "know that I am like the\r\nlatticed window, and the divine light passes through to avail others,\r\nthough alas! it helpeth not me. Thou art like the iron stanchions, which\r\nneither receive light themselves, nor communicate it to any one."\r\n\r\n"Prate not to me, but depart from this tent," said the Grand Master;\r\n"the Marquis shall not confess this morning, unless it be to me, for I\r\npart not from his side."\r\n\r\n"Is this _your_ pleasure?" said the Hermit to Conrade; "for think not I\r\nwill obey that proud man, if you continue to desire my assistance."\r\n\r\n"Alas!" said Conrade irresolutely, "what would you have me say? Farewell\r\nfor a while--we will speak anon."\r\n\r\n"O, procrastination!" exclaimed the Hermit, "thou art a\r\nsoul-murderer!--Unhappy man, farewell; not for a while, but until we\r\nboth shall meet--no matter where.--And for thee," he added, turning to\r\nthe Grand Master, "TREMBLE!"\r\n\r\n"Tremble!" replied the Templar contemptuously, "I cannot if I would."\r\n\r\nThe Hermit heard not his answer, having left the tent.\r\n\r\n"Come! to this gear hastily," said the Grand Master, "since thou wilt\r\nneeds go through the foolery.--Hark thee--I think I know most of thy\r\nfrailties by heart, so we may omit the detail, which may be somewhat a\r\nlong one, and begin with the absolution. What signifies counting the\r\nspots of dirt that we are about to wash from our hands?"\r\n\r\n"Knowing what thou art thyself," said Conrade, "it is blasphemous to\r\nspeak of pardoning another."\r\n\r\n"That is not according to the canon, Lord Marquis," said the Templar;\r\n"thou art more scrupulous than orthodox. The absolution of the wicked\r\npriest is as effectual as if he were himself a saint; otherwise,--God\r\nhelp the poor penitent! What wounded man inquires whether the surgeon\r\nthat tents his gashes have clean hands or not?--Come, shall we to this\r\ntoy?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Conrade, "I will rather die unconfessed than mock the\r\nsacrament."\r\n\r\n"Come, noble Marquis," said the Templar, "rouse up your courage, and\r\nspeak not thus. In an hour\'s time thou shalt stand victorious in the\r\nlists, or confess thee in thy helmet, like a valiant knight."\r\n\r\n"Alas, Grand Master!" answered Conrade, "all augurs ill for this affair.\r\nThe strange discovery by the instinct of a dog, the revival of this\r\nScottish knight, who comes into the lists like a spectre,--all betokens\r\nevil."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw!" said the Templar, "I have seen thee bend thy lance boldly\r\nagainst him in sport, and with equal chance of success. Think thou art\r\nbut in a tournament, and who bears him better in the tilt-yard than\r\nthou?--Come, squires and armorers, your master must be accoutred for the\r\nfield."\r\n\r\nThe attendants entered accordingly, and began to arm the Marquis.\r\n\r\n"What morning is without?" said Conrade.\r\n\r\n"The sun rises dimly," answered a squire.\r\n\r\n"Thou seest, Grand Master," said Conrade, "naught smiles on us."\r\n\r\n"Thou wilt fight the more coolly, my son," answered the Templar. "Thank\r\nHeaven that hath tempered the sun of Palestine to suit thine occasion."\r\n\r\nThus jested the Grand Master; but his jests had lost their influence on\r\nthe harassed mind of the Marquis, and, notwithstanding his attempts to\r\nseem gay, his gloom communicated itself to the Templar.\r\n\r\n"This craven," he thought, "will lose the day in pure faintness and\r\ncowardice of heart, which he calls tender conscience. I, whom visions\r\nand auguries shake not--who am firm in my purpose as the living rock--I\r\nshould have fought the combat myself.--Would to God the Scot may strike\r\nhim dead on the spot; it were next best to his winning the victory. But,\r\ncome what will, he must have no other confessor than myself. Our sins\r\nare too much in common, and he might confess my share with his own."\r\n\r\nWhile these thoughts passed through his mind, he continued to assist the\r\nMarquis in arming, but it was in silence.\r\n\r\nThe hour at length arrived, the trumpets sounded, the knights rode into\r\nthe lists armed at all points, and mounted like men who were to do\r\nbattle for a kingdom\'s honor. They wore their visors up, and, riding\r\naround the lists three times, showed themselves to the spectators. Both\r\nwere goodly persons, and both had noble countenances. But there was an\r\nair of manly confidence on the brow of the Scot, a radiancy of hope,\r\nwhich amounted even to cheerfulness, while, although pride and effort\r\nhad recalled much of Conrade\'s natural courage, there lowered still on\r\nhis brow a cloud of ominous despondence. Even his steed seemed to tread\r\nless lightly and blithely to the trumpet-sound than the noble Arab which\r\nwas bestrode by Sir Kenneth; and the _spruch-sprecher_ shook his head\r\nwhile he observed, that while the challenger rode around the lists in\r\nthe course of the sun--that is, from right to left--the defender made\r\nthe same circuit _widder-sins_--that is, from left to right--which is in\r\nmost countries held ominous.\r\n\r\nA temporary altar was erected just beneath the gallery occupied by the\r\nQueen, and beside it stood the Hermit in the dress of his order, as a\r\nCarmelite friar. Other churchmen were also present. To this altar the\r\nchallenger and defender were successively brought forward, conducted by\r\ntheir respective sponsors. Dismounting before it, each knight avouched\r\nthe justice of his cause by a solemn oath on the Evangelists, and prayed\r\nthat his success might be according to the truth or falsehood of what he\r\nthen swore. They also made oath, that they came to do battle in knightly\r\nguise, and with the usual weapons, disclaiming the use of spells,\r\ncharms, or magical devices, to incline victory to their side. The\r\nchallenger pronounced his vow with a firm and manly voice, and a bold\r\nand cheerful countenance. When the ceremony was finished, the Scottish\r\nKnight looked at the gallery, and bent his head to the earth, as if in\r\nhonor of those invisible beauties which were enclosed within; then,\r\nloaded with armor as he was, sprung to the saddle without the use of the\r\nstirrup, and made his courser carry him in a succession of caracoles to\r\nhis station at the eastern extremity of the lists. Conrade also\r\npresented himself before the altar with boldness enough; but his voice,\r\nas he took the oath, sounded hollow, as if drowned in his helmet. The\r\nlips with which he appealed to Heaven to adjudge victory to the just\r\nquarrel, grew white as they uttered the impious mockery. As he turned\r\nto remount his horse, the Grand Master approached him closer, as if to\r\nrectify something about the sitting of his gorget, and whispered,\r\n"Coward and fool! recall thy senses, and do me this battle bravely;\r\nelse, by Heaven, shouldst thou escape him, thou escapest not _me_!"\r\n\r\nThe savage tone in which this was whispered, perhaps completed the\r\nconfusion of the Marquis\'s nerves, for he stumbled as he made to horse;\r\nand though he recovered his feet, sprung to the saddle with his usual\r\nagility, and displayed his address in horsemanship as he assumed his\r\nposition opposite to the challenger\'s, yet the accident did not escape\r\nthose who were on the watch for omens, which might predict the fate of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nThe priests, after a solemn prayer that God would show the rightful\r\nquarrel, departed from the lists. The trumpets of the challenger then\r\nrung a flourish, and the herald-at-arms proclaimed at the eastern end\r\nof the lists,--"Here stands a good knight, Sir Kenneth of Scotland,\r\nchampion for the royal King Richard of England, who accuseth Conrade,\r\nMarquis of Montserrat, of foul treason and dishonor done to the said\r\nKing."\r\n\r\nWhen the words Kenneth of Scotland announced the name and character of\r\nthe champion, hitherto scarce generally known, a loud and cheerful\r\nacclaim burst from the followers of King Richard, and hardly,\r\nnotwithstanding repeated commands of silence, suffered the reply of the\r\ndefendant to be heard. He, of course, avouched his innocence, and\r\noffered his body for battle. The esquires of the combatants now\r\napproached, and delivered to each his shield and lance, assisting to\r\nhang the former around his neck, that his two hands might remain free,\r\none for the management of the bridle, the other to direct the lance.\r\n\r\nThe shield of the Scot displayed his old bearing, the leopard, but with\r\nthe addition of a collar and broken chain, in allusion to his late\r\ncaptivity. The shield of the Marquis bore, in reference to his title, a\r\nserrated and rocky mountain. Each shook his lance aloft, as if to\r\nascertain the weight and toughness of the unwieldy weapon, and then laid\r\nit in the rest. The sponsors, heralds, and squires, now retired to the\r\nbarriers, and the combatants sat opposite to each other, face to face,\r\nwith couched lance and closed visor, the human form so completely\r\nenclosed, that they looked more like statues of molten iron than beings\r\nof flesh and blood. The silence of suspense was now general--men\r\nbreathed thicker, and their very souls seemed seated in their eyes,\r\nwhile not a sound was to be heard save the snorting and pawing of the\r\ngood steeds, who, sensible of what was about to happen, were impatient\r\nto dash into career. They stood thus for perhaps three minutes, when at\r\na signal given by the Soldan, an hundred instruments rent the air with\r\ntheir brazen clamors, and each champion striking his horse with the\r\nspurs, and slacking the rein, the horses started into full gallop, and\r\nthe knights met in mid space with a shock like a thunderbolt. The\r\nvictory was not in doubt--no, not one moment. Conrade, indeed, showed\r\nhimself a practised warrior; for he struck his antagonist knightly in\r\nthe midst of his shield, bearing his lance so straight and true, that it\r\nshivered into splinters from the steel spear-head up to the very\r\ngauntlet. The horse of Sir Kenneth recoiled two or three yards and fell\r\non his haunches, but the rider easily raised him with hand and rein. But\r\nfor Conrade there was no recovery. Sir Kenneth\'s lance had pierced\r\nthrough the shield, through a plated corselet of Milan steel, through a\r\n_secret_, or coat of linked mail, worn beneath the corselet, had\r\nwounded him deep in the bosom, and borne him from his saddle, leaving\r\nthe truncheon of the lance fixed in his wound. The sponsors, heralds,\r\nand Saladin himself, descending from his throne, crowded around the\r\nwounded man; while Sir Kenneth, who had drawn his sword ere yet he\r\ndiscovered his antagonist was totally helpless, now commanded him to\r\navow his guilt. The helmet was hastily unclosed, and the wounded man,\r\ngazing wildly on the skies, replied, "What would you more? God hath\r\ndecided justly. I am guilty--but there are worse traitors in the camp\r\nthan I.--In pity to my soul, let me have a confessor!"\r\n\r\nHe revived as he uttered these words.\r\n\r\n"The talisman--the powerful remedy, royal brother," said King Richard to\r\nSaladin.\r\n\r\n"The traitor," answered the Soldan, "is more fit to be dragged from the\r\nlists to the gallows by the heels, than to profit by its virtues: and\r\nsome such fate is in his look," he added, after gazing fixedly upon the\r\nwounded man; "for though his wound may be cured, yet Azrael\'s seal is on\r\nthe wretch\'s brow."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless," said Richard, "I pray you do for him what you may, that\r\nhe may at least have time for confession. Slay not soul and body! To him\r\none half-hour of time may be worth more, by ten thousand fold, than the\r\nlife of the oldest patriarch."\r\n\r\n"My royal brother\'s wish shall be obeyed," said Saladin.--"Slaves, bear\r\nthis wounded man to our tent."\r\n\r\n"Do not so," said the Templar, who had hitherto stood gloomily looking\r\non in silence. "The royal Duke of Austria and myself will not permit\r\nthis unhappy Christian prince to be delivered over to the Saracens,\r\nthat they may try their spells upon him. We are his sponsors, and demand\r\nthat he be assigned to our care."\r\n\r\n"That is, you refuse the certain means offered to recover him?" said\r\nRichard.\r\n\r\n"Not so," said the Grand Master, recollecting himself. "If the Soldan\r\nuseth lawful medicines, he may attend the patient in my tent."\r\n\r\n"Do so, I pray thee, good brother," said Richard to Saladin, "though the\r\npermission be ungraciously yielded.--But now to a more glorious work.\r\nSound, trumpets--shout, England, in honor of England\'s champion!"\r\n\r\nDrum, clarion, trumpet, and cymbal, rung forth at once, and the deep and\r\nregular shout, which for ages has been the English acclamation, sounded\r\namidst the shrill and irregular yells of the Arabs, like the diapason of\r\nthe organ amid the howling of a storm. There was silence at length.\r\n\r\n"Brave Knight of the Leopard," resumed Coeur de Lion, "thou hast shown\r\nthat the Ethiopian _may_ change his skin and the Leopard his spots,\r\nthough clerks quote Scripture for the impossibility. Yet I have more to\r\nsay to you when I have conducted you to the presence of the ladies, the\r\nbest judges, and best rewarders, of deeds of chivalry."\r\n\r\nThe Knight of the Leopard bowed assent.\r\n\r\n"And thou, princely Saladin, wilt also attend them. I promise thee our\r\nQueen will not think herself welcome, if she lacks the opportunity to\r\nthank her royal host for her most princely reception."\r\n\r\nSaladin bent his head gracefully, but declined the invitation.\r\n\r\n"I must attend the wounded man," he said. "The leech leaves not his\r\npatient more than the champion the lists, even if he be summoned to a\r\nbower like those of Paradise.... At noon," said the Soldan, as he\r\ndeparted, "I trust ye will all accept a collation under the black\r\ncamel-skin tent of a chief of Curdistan."\r\n\r\nThe same invitation was circulated among the Christians, comprehending\r\nall those of sufficient importance to be admitted to sit at a feast made\r\nfor princes.\r\n\r\n"Hark!" said Richard, "the timbrels announce that our Queen and her\r\nattendants are leaving their gallery; and see, the turbans sink on the\r\nground, as if struck down by a destroying angel. All lie prostrate, as\r\nif the glance of an Arab\'s eye could sully the lustre of a lady\'s cheek!\r\nCome, we will to the pavillion, and lead our conqueror thither in\r\ntriumph. How I pity that noble Soldan, who knows but of love as it is\r\nknown to those of inferior nature!"\r\n\r\nBlondel tuned his harp to its boldest measure, to welcome the\r\nintroduction of the victor into the pavilion of Queen Berengaria.\r\nHe entered, supported on either side by his sponsors, Richard and\r\nWilliam Longsword, and knelt gracefully down before the Queen, though\r\nmore than half the homage was silently rendered to Edith, who sat on\r\nher right hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Unarm him, my mistresses," said the King, whose delight was in the\r\nexecution of such chivalrous usages; "let Beauty honor Chivalry! Undo\r\nhis spurs, Berengaria; Queen though thou be, thou owest him what marks\r\nof favor thou canst give.--Unlace his helmet, Edith; by this hand, thou\r\nshalt, wert thou the proudest Plantagenet of the line, and he the\r\npoorest knight on earth!"\r\n\r\nBoth ladies obeyed the royal commands,--Berengaria with bustling\r\nassiduity, as anxious to gratify her husband\'s humor, and Edith\r\nblushing and growing pale alternately, as slowly and awkwardly she\r\nundid, with Longsword\'s assistance, the fastenings which secured the\r\nhelmet to the gorget.\r\n\r\n"And what expect you from beneath this iron shell?" said Richard, as the\r\nremoval of the casque gave to view the noble countenance of Sir Kenneth,\r\nhis face glowing with recent exertion, and not less so with present\r\nemotion. "What think ye of him, gallants and beauties?" said Richard.\r\n"Doth he resemble an Ethiopian slave, or doth he present the face of an\r\nobscure and nameless adventurer? No, by my good sword! Here terminate\r\nhis various disguises. He hath knelt down before you, unknown save by\r\nhis worth; he arises, equally distinguished by birth and by fortune. The\r\nadventurous knight, Kenneth, arises David, Earl of Huntingdon, Prince\r\nRoyal of Scotland!"\r\n\r\nThere was a general exclamation of surprise, and Edith dropped from her\r\nhand the helmet which she had just received....\r\n\r\n"May we know of your grace by what strange and happy chance this riddle\r\nhas been read?" said the Queen Berengaria.\r\n\r\n"Letters were brought to us from England," said the King, "in which we\r\nlearned, among other unpleasant news, that the King of Scotland had\r\nseized upon three of our nobles, when on a pilgrimage to Saint Ninian,\r\nand alleged as a cause, that his heir being supposed to be fighting in\r\nthe ranks of the Teutonic Knights, against the heathen of Borussia, was,\r\nin fact, in our camp and in our power; and, therefore, William proposed\r\nto hold these nobles as hostages for his safety. This gave me the first\r\nlight on the real rank of the Knight of the Leopard, and my suspicions\r\nwere confirmed by De Vaux, who, on his return from Ascalon, brought back\r\nwith him the Earl of Huntingdon\'s sole attendant, a thick-skulled slave,\r\nwho had gone thirty miles to unfold to De Vaux a secret he should have\r\ntold to me."\r\n\r\n"Old Strauchan must be excused," said the Lord of Gilsland. "He knew\r\nfrom experience that my heart is somewhat softer than if I wrote myself\r\nPlantagenet."\r\n\r\n"Thy heart soft? thou commodity of old iron, and Cumberland flint that\r\nthou art!" exclaimed the King. "It is we Plantagenets who boast soft and\r\nfeeling hearts, Edith," he continued, turning to his cousin, with an\r\nexpression which called the blood into her cheek.--"Give me thy hand, my\r\nfair cousin, and, Prince of Scotland, thine."...\r\n\r\nIt is needless to follow into further particulars the conferences at the\r\nroyal tent, or to enquire whether David, Earl of Huntingdon, was as mute\r\nin the presence of Edith Plantagenet, as when he was bound to act under\r\nthe character of an obscure and nameless adventurer. It may be well\r\nbelieved that he there expressed, with suitable earnestness, the passion\r\nto which he had so often before found it difficult to give words.\r\n\r\nThe hour of noon now approached, and Saladin waited to receive the\r\nPrinces of Christendom in a tent, which, but for its large size,\r\ndiffered little from that of the ordinary shelter of the common Curdman,\r\nor Arab; yet, beneath its ample and sable covering, was prepared a\r\nbanquet after the most gorgeous fashion of the East, extended upon\r\ncarpets of the richest stuffs, with cushions laid for the guests. But we\r\ncannot stop to describe the cloth of gold and silver, the superb\r\nembroidery in Arabesque, the shawls of Cashmere, and the muslins of\r\nIndia, which were here unfolded in all their splendor; far less to tell\r\nthe different sweetmeats, ragouts edged with rice colored in various\r\nmanners, with all the other niceties of Eastern cookery. Lambs roasted\r\nwhole, and game and poultry dressed in pilaus, were piled in vessels of\r\ngold, and silver, and porcelain, and intermixed with large mazers of\r\nsherbet, cooled in snow and ice from the caverns of Mount Lebanon. A\r\nmagnificent pile of cushions at the head of the banquet, seemed prepared\r\nfor the master of the feast, and such dignitaries as he might call to\r\nshare that place of distinction, while from the roof of the tent in all\r\nquarters, but over this seat of eminence in particular, waved many a\r\nbanner and pennon, the trophies of battles won, and kingdoms overthrown.\r\nBut amongst and above them all, a long lance displayed a shroud, the\r\nbanner of Death, with this impressive inscription, "SALADIN, KING OF\r\nKINGS--SALADIN, VICTOR OF VICTORS--SALADIN MUST DIE." Amid these\r\npreparations, the slaves who had arranged the refreshments stood with\r\ndrooped heads and folded arms, mute and motionless as monumental\r\nstatuary, or as automata, which waited the touch of the artist to put\r\nthem in motion.\r\n\r\nExpecting the approach of his princely guests, the Soldan, imbued, as\r\nmost were, with the superstitions of his time, paused over a horoscope\r\nand corresponding scroll, which had been sent to him by the Hermit of\r\nEngaddi when he departed from the camp.\r\n\r\n"Strange and mysterious science," he muttered to himself, "which,\r\npretending to draw the curtain of futurity, misleads those whom it seems\r\nto guide, and darkens the scene which it pretends to illuminate! Who\r\nwould not have said that I was that enemy most dangerous to Richard,\r\nwhose enmity was to be ended by marriage with his kinswoman? Yet it now\r\nappears that a union betwixt this gallant Earl and the lady will bring\r\nabout friendship betwixt Richard and Scotland, an enemy more dangerous\r\nthan I, as a wild cat in a chamber is more to be dreaded than a lion in\r\na distant desert.--But then,...--How now, what means this intrusion?"\r\n\r\nHe spoke to the dwarf Nectabanus, who rushed into the tent fearfully\r\nagitated, with each strange and disproportioned feature wrenched by\r\nhorror into still more extravagant ugliness,--his mouth open, his eyes\r\nstaring, his hands, with their shrivelled and deformed fingers, wildly\r\nexpanded.\r\n\r\n"What now?" said the Soldan, sternly.\r\n\r\n"_Accipe hoc!_" groaned out the dwarf.\r\n\r\n"Ha! say\'st thou?" answered Saladin.\r\n\r\n"_Accipe hoc!_" replied the panic-struck creature, unconscious, perhaps,\r\nthat he repeated the same words as before.\r\n\r\n"Hence! I am in no vein for foolery," said the Emperor.\r\n\r\n"Nor am I further fool," said the dwarf, "than to make my folly help out\r\nmy wits to earn my bread, poor helpless wretch!--Hear, hear me, great\r\nSoldan!"\r\n\r\n"Nay, if thou hast actual wrong to complain of," said Saladin, "fool or\r\nwise, thou art entitled to the ear of a King.--Retire hither with me;"\r\nand he led him into the inner tent.\r\n\r\nWhatever their conference related to, it was soon broken off by the\r\nfanfare of the trumpets, announcing the arrival of the various Christian\r\nprinces, whom Saladin welcomed to his tent with a royal courtesy well\r\nbecoming their rank and his own; but chiefly he saluted the young Earl\r\nof Huntingdon, and generously congratulated him upon prospects, which\r\nseemed to have interfered with and overclouded those which he had\r\nhimself entertained.\r\n\r\n"But think not," said the Soldan, "thou noble youth, that the Prince of\r\nScotland is more welcome to Saladin, than was Kenneth to the solitary\r\nIlderim when they met in the desert, or the distressed Ethiop to the\r\nHakim Adonbec. A brave and generous disposition like thine hath a value\r\nindependent of condition and birth, as the cool draught which I here\r\nproffer thee, is as delicious from an earthen vessel as from a goblet of\r\ngold."\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Huntingdon made a suitable reply, gratefully acknowledging\r\nthe various important services he had received from the generous Soldan;\r\nbut when he had pledged Saladin in the bowl of sherbet which the Soldan\r\nhad proffered to him, he could not help remarking with a smile, "The\r\nbrave cavalier, Ilderim, knew not of the formation of ice, but the\r\nmunificent Soldan cools his sherbet with snow."\r\n\r\n"Wouldst thou have an Arab or a Curdman as wise as a Hakim?" said the\r\nSoldan. "He who does on a disguise must make the sentiments of his heart\r\nand the learning of his head accord with the dress which he assumes. I\r\ndesired to see how a brave and single-hearted cavalier of Frangistan\r\nwould conduct himself in debate with such a chief as I then seemed; and\r\nI questioned the truth of a well-known fact, to know by what arguments\r\nthou wouldst support thy assertion."\r\n\r\nWhile they were speaking, the Archduke of Austria, who stood a little\r\napart, was struck with the mention of iced sherbet, and took with\r\npleasure and some bluntness the deep goblet, as the Earl of Huntingdon\r\nwas about to replace it.\r\n\r\n"Most delicious!" he exclaimed, after a deep draught, which the heat of\r\nthe weather, and the feverishness following the debauch of the preceding\r\nday, had rendered doubly acceptable. He sighed as he handed the cup to\r\nthe Grand Master of the Templars. Saladin made a sign to the dwarf, who\r\nadvanced and pronounced, with a harsh voice, the words, _Accipe hoc!_\r\nThe Templar started, like a steed who sees a lion under a bush, beside\r\nthe pathway; yet instantly recovered, and to hide, perhaps, his\r\nconfusion, raised the goblet to his lips;--but those lips never touched\r\nthat goblet\'s rim. The sabre of Saladin left its sheath as lightning\r\nleaves the cloud. It was waved in the air,--and the head of the Grand\r\nMaster rolled to the extremity of the tent, while the trunk remained,\r\nfor a second, standing, with the goblet still clenched in its grasp,\r\nthen fell, the liquor mingling with the blood that spurted from the\r\nveins.\r\n\r\nThere was a general exclamation of treason, and Austria, nearest to whom\r\nSaladin stood with the bloody sabre in his hand, started back as if\r\napprehensive that his turn was to come next. Richard and others laid\r\nhand on their swords.\r\n\r\n"Fear nothing, noble Austria," said Saladin, as composedly as if nothing\r\nhad happened, "nor you, royal England, be wroth at what you have seen.\r\nNot for his manifold treasons;--not for the attempt which, as may be\r\nvouched by his own squire, he instigated against King Richard\'s\r\nlife;--not that he pursued the Prince of Scotland and myself in the\r\ndesert, reducing us to save our lives by the speed of our horses;--not\r\nthat he had stirred up the Maronites to attack us upon this very\r\noccasion, had I not brought up unexpectedly so many Arabs as rendered\r\nthe scheme abortive;--not for any or all of these crimes does he now\r\nlie there, although each were deserving such a doom;--but because,\r\nscarce half-an-hour ere he polluted our presence, as the simoom\r\nempoisons the atmosphere, he poniarded his comrade and accomplice,\r\nConrade of Montserrat, lest he should confess the infamous plots in\r\nwhich they had both been engaged."\r\n\r\n"How! Conrade murdered?--And by the Grand Master, his sponsor and most\r\nintimate friend!" exclaimed Richard. "Noble Soldan, I would not doubt\r\nthee; yet this must be proved; otherwise"----\r\n\r\n"There stands the evidence," said Saladin, pointing to the terrified\r\ndwarf. "Allah, who sends the fire-fly to illuminate the night-season,\r\ncan discover secret crimes by the most contemptible means."\r\n\r\nThe Soldan proceeded to tell the dwarf\'s story, which amounted to\r\nthis.--In his foolish curiosity, or as he partly confessed, with some\r\nthoughts of pilfering, Nectabanus had strayed into the tent of Conrade,\r\nwhich had been deserted by his attendants, some of whom had left the\r\nencampment to carry the news of his defeat to his brother, and others\r\nwere availing themselves of the means which Saladin had supplied for\r\nrevelling. The wounded man slept under the influence of Saladin\'s\r\nwonderful talisman, so that the dwarf had opportunity to pry about at\r\npleasure, until he was frightened into concealment by the sound of a\r\nheavy step. He skulked behind a curtain, yet could see the motions, and\r\nhear the words of the Grand Master, who entered, and carefully secured\r\nthe covering of the pavillion behind him. His victim started from sleep,\r\nand it would appear that he instantly suspected the purpose of his old\r\nassociate, for it was in a tone of alarm that he demanded wherefore he\r\ndisturbed him.\r\n\r\n"I come to confess and absolve thee," answered the Grand Master.\r\n\r\nOf their further speech the terrified dwarf remembered little, save that\r\nConrade implored the Grand Master not to break a wounded reed, and that\r\nthe Templar struck him to the heart with a Turkish dagger, with the\r\nwords _Accipe hoc_,--words which long afterward haunted the terrified\r\nimagination of the concealed witness.\r\n\r\n"I verified the tale," said Saladin, "by causing the body to be\r\nexamined; and I made this unhappy being, whom Allah hath made the\r\ndiscoverer of the crime, repeat in your own presence the words which the\r\nmurderer spoke, and you yourselves saw the effect which they produced\r\nupon his conscience."\r\n\r\nThe Soldan paused, and the King of England broke silence:--\r\n\r\n"If this be true, as I doubt not, we have witnessed a great act of\r\njustice, though it bore a different aspect. But wherefore in this\r\npresence? wherefore with thine own hand?"\r\n\r\n"I had designed otherwise," said Saladin, "but had I not hastened his\r\ndoom, it had been altogether averted, since, if I had permitted him to\r\ntaste of my cup, as he was about to do, how could I, without incurring\r\nthe brand of inhospitality, have done him to death as he deserved? Had\r\nhe murdered my father, and afterward partaken of my food and my bowl,\r\nnot a hair of his head could have been injured by me. But enough of him;\r\nlet his carcass and his memory be removed from amongst us."\r\n\r\nThe body was carried away, and the marks of the slaughter obliterated or\r\nconcealed with such ready dexterity, as showed that the case was not\r\naltogether so uncommon, as to paralyze the assistants and officers of\r\nSaladin\'s household.\r\n\r\nBut the Christian princes felt that the scene which they had beheld\r\nweighed heavily on their spirits, and although, at the courteous\r\ninvitation of the Soldan, they assumed their seats at the banquet, yet\r\nit was with the silence of doubt and amazement. The spirits of Richard\r\nalone surmounted all cause for suspicion or embarrassment. Yet he, too,\r\nseemed to ruminate on some proposition, as if he were desirous of making\r\nit in the most insinuating and acceptable manner which was possible. At\r\nlength he drank off a large bowl of wine, and addressing the Soldan,\r\ndesired to know whether it was not true that he had honored the Earl of\r\nHuntingdon with a personal encounter.\r\n\r\nSaladin answered with a smile, that he had proved his horse and his\r\nweapons with the heir of Scotland, as cavaliers are wont to do with each\r\nother when they meet in the desert; and modestly added that, though the\r\ncombat was not entirely decisive, he had not, on his part, much reason\r\nto pride himself on the event. The Scot, on the other hand, disclaimed\r\nthe attributed superiority, and wished to assign it to the Soldan.\r\n\r\n"Enough of honor thou hast had in the encounter," said Richard, "and I\r\nenvy thee more for that, than for the smiles of Edith Plantagenet,\r\nthough one of them might reward a bloody day\'s work.--But what say you,\r\nnoble princes; is it fitting that such a royal ring of chivalry should\r\nbreak up without something being done for future times to speak of? What\r\nis the overthrow and death of a traitor, to such a fair garland of honor\r\nas is here assembled, and which ought not to part without witnessing\r\nsomething more worthy of their regard? How say you, princely Soldan;\r\nwhat if we two should now, and before this fair company, decide the\r\nlong-contended question for this land of Palestine, and end at once\r\nthese tedious wars? Yonder are the lists ready, nor can Paynimrie ever\r\nhope a better champion than thou. I, unless worthier offers, will lay\r\ndown my gauntlet in behalf of Christendom, and, in all love and honor,\r\nwe will do mortal battle for the possession of Jerusalem."\r\n\r\nThere was a deep pause for the Soldan\'s answer. His cheek and brow\r\ncolored highly, and it was the opinion of many present that he hesitated\r\nwhether he should accept the challenge. At length he said: "Fighting for\r\nthe Holy City against those whom we regard as idolaters, and worshippers\r\nof stocks and stones, and graven images, I might confide that Allah\r\nwould strengthen my arm; or if I fell beneath the sword of the Melech\r\nRic, I could not pass to Paradise by a more glorious death. But Allah\r\nhas already given Jerusalem to the true believers, and it were a\r\ntempting the God of the Prophet to peril, upon my own personal strength\r\nand skill, that which I hold securely by the superiority of my forces."\r\n\r\n"If not for Jerusalem, then," said Richard, in the tone of one who would\r\nentreat a favor of an intimate friend, "yet, for the love of honor, let\r\nus run at least three courses with grinded lances."\r\n\r\n"Even this," said Saladin, half smiling at Coeur de Lion\'s\r\naffectionate earnestness for the combat, "even this I may not lawfully\r\ndo. The Master places the shepherd over the flock, not for the\r\nshepherd\'s own sake, but for the sake of the sheep. Had I a son to hold\r\nthe sceptre when I fell, I might have had the liberty, as I have the\r\nwill, to brave this bold encounter; but your own Scripture sayeth, that\r\nwhen the herdsman is smitten, the sheep are scattered."\r\n\r\n"Thou hast had all the fortune," said Richard, turning to the Earl of\r\nHuntingdon with a sigh. "I would have given the best year of my life for\r\nthat one half-hour beside the Diamond of the Desert!"\r\n\r\nThe chivalrous extravagance of Richard awakened the spirits of the\r\nassembly, and when at length they arose to depart, Saladin advanced and\r\ntook Coeur de Lion by the hand.\r\n\r\n"Noble King of England," he said, "we now part, never to meet again.\r\nThat your league is dissolved, no more to be reunited, and that your\r\nnative forces are far too few to enable you to prosecute your\r\nenterprise, is as well known to me as to yourself. I may not yield you\r\nup that Jerusalem which you so much desire to hold. It is to us, as to\r\nyou, a Holy City. But whatever other terms Richard demands of Saladin,\r\nshall be as willingly yielded as yonder fountain yields its waters. Ay,\r\nand the same should be as frankly afforded by Saladin, if Richard stood\r\nin the desert with but two archers in his train!"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[I] While the army of the crusaders was inactive near Ascalon, a\r\ntruce having been agreed to between the Saracens and their\r\nassailants, the Grand Master of the Templars, Conrade Marquis of\r\nMontserrat, and others of the Christian Princes, were plotting to\r\neffect its dismemberment. Richard of England was the leading spirit\r\nof the crusade, and the plotters wished either to get rid of him or\r\nto inspire his colleagues with jealousy of his leadership. The Grand\r\nMaster sought to have the King assassinated. Conrade tried to break\r\nup the league by milder means: he first provoked the Duke of Austria\r\nto insult the English banner; and then thinking rightly that the\r\nsuspicion and wrath of Richard would fall upon Austria, he secretly\r\nstole the banner from its place. Its safe-keeping, after Austria\'s\r\ninsult, had been entrusted by the King to Sir Kenneth, known as the\r\nKnight of the Leopard, in reality David Prince of Scotland, who in\r\nthe disguise of an obscure gentleman had joined the crusade as a\r\nfollower of the English King. Sir Kenneth was innocently decoyed from\r\nhis watch, and in his absence, the banner, left with but his dog to\r\nguard it, was stolen by Conrade. For his failure of duty. Sir Kenneth\r\nwas condemned to immediate death, but Saladin, who in the disguise of\r\nan Arab physician was in the English camp, and who had rescued the\r\nKing from death by fever, urgently interceding, his life was spared.\r\nSaladin took Sir Kenneth to the camp of the Saracens, and knowing his\r\nworth and valor, having previously had knightly encounter with him in\r\nthe desert, disguised him as a Nubian slave, and sent him as a\r\npresent to Richard with the hope that he might in some way discover\r\nby whom the banner had been stolen. Attending Richard as a slave Sir\r\nKenneth saved the king from the assassination which the Grand Master\r\nhad instigated, and aided by the instinct of his dog, also disguised,\r\nhe detected the thief in Conrade. Richard thereupon, at once charged\r\nConrade with the theft, and challenged him to mortal combat. The King\r\nwas prevented by the Council of the Princes from fighting in person,\r\nbut having divined in the Nubian slave the former Knight of the\r\nLeopard, he permitted Sir Kenneth to fight in his stead, that the\r\nknight might atone for the dishonor of being faithless in his watch.\r\nConrade\'s cause was espoused by the Grand Master, who had been his\r\nconfidant, and by the Duke of Austria. The encounter was appointed to\r\ntake place at the Diamond of the Desert, in the territory of Saladin,\r\nwho was asked to act as umpire. It had been stipulated that but five\r\nhundred Saracens should be present at the trial; Saladin, however,\r\nhaving been apprised of further plotting on the part of the Grand\r\nMaster, for safety\'s sake caused a larger attendance of his\r\nfollowers. Sir Kenneth had long loved Edith Plantagenet, but being\r\nknown to her only as a poor and nameless adventurer, he had not yet\r\nopenly avowed his love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI.

DEAR HARP OF MY COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nMOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dear Harp of my Country! in darkness I found thee,\r\n      The cold chain of silence had hung o\'er thee long,\r\n    When proudly, my own Island Harp, I unbound thee,\r\n      And gave all thy chords to light, freedom, and song!\r\n\r\n    The warm lay of love and the light note of gladness\r\n      Have waken\'d thy fondest, thy liveliest thrill;\r\n    But, so oft hast thou echo\'d the deep sigh of sadness,\r\n      That ev\'n in thy mirth it will steal from thee still.\r\n\r\n    Dear Harp of my Country! farewell to thy numbers,\r\n      This sweet wreath of song is the last we shall twine!\r\n    Go, sleep with the sunshine of fame on thy slumbers,\r\n      Till touch\'d by some hand less unworthy than mine;\r\n\r\n    If the pulse of the patriot, soldier, or lover,\r\n      Have throbb\'d at our lay, \'tis thy glory alone;\r\n    I was _but_ as the wind, passing heedlessly over,\r\n      And all the wild sweetness I waked was thy own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. COME, YE DISCONSOLATE.\r\n\r\nMOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Come, ye disconsolate, where\'er you languish,\r\n      Come, at God\'s altar fervently kneel;\r\n    Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish--\r\n      Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal.\r\n\r\n    Joy of the desolate, Light of the straying,\r\n      Hope, when all others die, fadeless and pure,\r\n    Here speaks the Comforter, in God\'s name saying,--\r\n      "Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot cure."\r\n\r\n    Go, ask the infidel, what boon he brings us,\r\n      What charm for aching hearts _he_ can reveal,\r\n    Sweet as that heavenly promise Hope sings us,\r\n      "Earth has no sorrow that God cannot heal."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX. ON A LOCK OF MILTON\'S HAIR.\r\n\r\nLEIGH HUNT.--1784-1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n    It lies before me there, and my own breath\r\n    Stirs its thin outer threads, as though beside\r\n    The living head I stood in honor\'d pride,\r\n    Talking of lovely things that conquer death.\r\n    Perhaps he press\'d it once, or underneath\r\n    Ran his fine fingers, when he leant, blank-ey\'d,\r\n    And saw, in fancy, Adam and his bride\r\n    With their rich locks, or his own Delphic wreath.\r\n    There seems a love in hair, though it be dead.\r\n    It is the gentlest, yet the strongest thread\r\n    Of our frail plant,--a blossom from the tree\r\n    Surviving the proud trunk;--as though it said\r\n    Patience and gentleness is power; in me\r\n    Behold affectionate eternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL. THE GLOVE AND THE LIONS.\r\n\r\nLEIGH HUNT.\r\n\r\n\r\n    King Francis was a hearty king, and lov\'d a royal sport,\r\n    And one day, as his lions strove, sat looking on the court:\r\n    The nobles fill\'d the benches round, the ladies by their side,\r\n    And \'mongst them Count de Lorge, with one he hoped to make\r\n              his bride;\r\n    And truly \'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show,\r\n    Valor and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.\r\n\r\n    Ramp\'d and roar\'d the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;\r\n    They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with\r\n              their paws;\r\n    With wallowing might and stifled roar they roll\'d one on another,\r\n    Till all the pit, with sand and mane, was in a thund\'rous smother;\r\n    The bloody foam above the bars came whizzing through the air;\r\n    Said Francis then, "Good gentlemen, we\'re better here than there!"\r\n\r\n    De Lorge\'s love o\'erheard the King, a beauteous, lively dame,\r\n    With smiling lips, and sharp bright eyes, which always seem\'d\r\n              the same:\r\n    She thought, "The Count, my lover, is as brave as brave can be;\r\n    He surely would do desperate things to show his love of me!\r\n    King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the chance is wondrous fine;\r\n    I\'ll drop my glove to prove his love; great glory will be mine!"\r\n\r\n    She dropp\'d her glove to prove his love: then look\'d on him\r\n              and smiled;\r\n    He bow\'d, and in a moment leap\'d among the lions wild:\r\n    The leap was quick; return was quick; he soon regain\'d his place;\r\n    Then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady\'s face!\r\n    "In truth!" cried Francis, "rightly done!" and he rose from where\r\n              he sat:\r\n    "No love," quoth he, "but vanity, sets love a task like that!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Rough wind, that moanest loud\r\n      Grief too sad for song;\r\n    Wild wind, when sullen cloud\r\n      Knells all the night long;\r\n    Sad storm, whose tears are vain,\r\n    Bare woods, whose branches strain,\r\n    Deep caves and dreary main,\r\n      Wail, for the world\'s wrong._\r\n\r\n         _A Dirge_.--SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI. THE CLOUD.\r\n\r\nPERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY.--1792-1822.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n    I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers\r\n      From the seas and the streams;\r\n    I bear light shade for the leaves when laid\r\n      In their noon-day dreams.\r\n    From my wings are shaken the dews that waken\r\n      The sweet buds every one,\r\n    When rock\'d to rest on their Mother\'s breast,\r\n      As she dances about the sun.\r\n    I wield the flail of the lashing hail,\r\n      And whiten the green plains under;\r\n    And then again I dissolve it in rain,\r\n      And laugh as I pass in thunder.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n    I sift the snow on the mountains below,\r\n      And their great pines groan aghast;\r\n    And all the night \'tis my pillow white,\r\n      While I sleep in the arms of the Blast.\r\n    Sublime on the towers of my skyey bowers\r\n      Lightning, my pilot, sits;\r\n    In a cavern under is fetter\'d the Thunder,--\r\n      It struggles and howls at fits.\r\n    Over earth and ocean with gentle motion\r\n      This pilot is guiding me,\r\n    Lured by the love of the Genii that move\r\n      In the depths of the purple sea;\r\n    Over the rills and the crags and the hills,\r\n      Over the lakes and the plains,\r\n    Wherever he dream under mountain or stream\r\n      The Spirit he loves remains;\r\n    And I all the while bask in heaven\'s blue smile,\r\n      Whilst he is dissolving in rains.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n    The sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor eyes,\r\n      And his burning plumes outspread,\r\n    Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,\r\n      When the morning star shines dead;\r\n    As on the jag of a mountain-crag,\r\n      Which an earthquake rocks and swings,\r\n    An eagle alit one moment may sit\r\n      In the light of its golden wings.\r\n    And, when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,\r\n      Its ardor of rest and of love,\r\n    And the crimson pall of eve may fall\r\n      From the depth of heaven above,\r\n    With wings folded I rest on mine airy nest,\r\n      As still as a brooding dove.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n    That orb\xc3\xa8d maiden, with white-fire laden,\r\n      Whom mortals call the Moon,\r\n    Glides glimmering o\'er my fleece-like floor\r\n      By the midnight breezes strewn;\r\n    And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,\r\n      Which only the angels hear,\r\n    May have broken the woof of my tent\'s thin roof,\r\n      The Stars peep behind her and peer.\r\n    And I laugh to see them whirl and flee\r\n      Like a swarm of golden bees,\r\n    When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,--\r\n      Till the calm rivers, lakes, and seas,\r\n    Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,\r\n      Are each pav\'d with the moon and these.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n    I bind the Sun\'s throne with a burning zone,\r\n      And the Moon\'s with a girdle of pearl;\r\n    The volcanoes are dim, and the Stars reel and swim,\r\n      When the Whirlwinds my banner unfurl.\r\n    From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,\r\n      Over a torrent sea,\r\n    Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof,--\r\n      The mountains its columns be.\r\n    The triumphal arch, through which I march,\r\n      With hurricane, fire, and snow,\r\n    When the Powers of the air are chain\'d to my chair,\r\n      Is the million-color\'d bow;\r\n    The Sphere-fire above its soft colors wove,\r\n      While the moist Earth was laughing below.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n    I am the daughter of Earth and Water,\r\n      And the nursling of the Sky;\r\n    I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;\r\n      I change, but I cannot die.\r\n    For after the rain, when with never a stain\r\n      The pavilion of heaven is bare,\r\n    And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams\r\n      Build up the blue dome of air,\r\n    I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,--\r\n      And out of the caverns of rain,\r\n    Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,\r\n      I arise, and unbuild it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII. ON FIRST LOOKING INTO CHAPMAN\'S HOMER.\r\n\r\nJOHN KEATS.--1795-1821.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Much have I travell\'d in the realms of gold,\r\n    And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;\r\n    Round many western islands have I been\r\n    Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.\r\n    Oft of one wide expanse had I been told\r\n    That deep-brow\'d Homer ruled as his demesne:\r\n    Yet did I never breathe its pure serene\r\n    Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:\r\n    Then felt I like some watcher of the skies\r\n    When a new planet swims into his ken;\r\n    Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes\r\n    He stared at the Pacific--and all his men\r\n    Look\'d at each other with a wild surmise--\r\n    Silent, upon a peak in Darien.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII. ON THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE CRICKET.\r\n\r\nKEATS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The poetry of earth is never dead:\r\n    When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,\r\n    And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run\r\n    From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead:\r\n    That is the grasshopper\'s--he takes the lead\r\n    In summer luxury,--he has never done\r\n    With his delights, for, when tired out with fun,\r\n    He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.\r\n    The poetry of earth is ceasing never:\r\n    On a lone winter evening, when the frost\r\n    Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills\r\n    The cricket\'s song, in warmth increasing ever,\r\n    And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,\r\n    The grasshopper\'s among some grassy hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV. THE POWER AND DANGER OF THE C\xc3\x86SARS.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS DE QUINCEY.--1785-1859.\r\n\r\n_From_ THE C\xc3\x86SARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this view of the imperial character and relations must be added one\r\nsingle circumstance, which in some measure altered the whole for the\r\nindividual who happened to fill the office. The emperor _de facto_ might\r\nbe viewed under two aspects; there was the man, and there was the\r\noffice. In his office he was immortal and sacred: but as a question\r\nmight still be raised, by means of a mercenary army, as to the claims of\r\nthe particular individual who at any time filled the office, the very\r\nsanctity and privilege of the character with which he was clothed might\r\nactually be turned against himself; and here it is, at this point, that\r\nthe character of Roman emperor became truly and mysteriously awful.\r\nGibbon has taken notice of the extraordinary situation of a _subject_ in\r\nthe Roman empire who should attempt to fly from the wrath of the C\xc3\xa6sar.\r\nSuch was the ubiquity of the emperor that this was metaphysically\r\nhopeless. Except across pathless deserts or amongst barbarous nomads, it\r\nwas impossible to find even a transient sanctuary from the imperial\r\npursuit. If the fugitive went down to the sea, there he met the emperor:\r\nif he took the wings of the morning, and fled to the uttermost parts of\r\nthe earth, there was also C\xc3\xa6sar in the person of his lieutenants. But,\r\nby a dreadful counter-charm, the same omnipresence of imperial anger and\r\nretribution which withered the hopes of the poor humble prisoner, met\r\nand confounded the emperor himself, when hurled from his elevation by\r\nsome fortunate rival. All the kingdoms of the earth, to one in that\r\nsituation, became but so many wards of the same infinite prison. Flight,\r\nif it were even successful for the moment, did but a little retard his\r\ninevitable doom. And so evident was this, that hardly in one instance\r\ndid the fallen prince _attempt_ to fly; passively he met the death which\r\nwas inevitable, in the very spot where ruin had overtaken him. Neither\r\nwas it possible even for a merciful conqueror to show mercy; for, in\r\nthe presence of an army so mercenary and factious, his own safety was\r\nbut too deeply involved in the extermination of rival pretenders to\r\nthe crown.\r\n\r\nSuch, amidst the sacred security and inviolability of the office, was\r\nthe hazardous tenure of the individual. Nor did his dangers always arise\r\nfrom persons in the rank of competitors and rivals. Sometimes it menaced\r\nhim in quarters which his eye had never penetrated, and from enemies too\r\nobscure to have reached his ear. By way of illustration we will cite a\r\ncase from the life of the Emperor Commodus, which is wild enough to have\r\nfurnished the plot of a romance, though as well authenticated as any\r\nother passage in that reign. The story is narrated by Herodian, and the\r\noutline was this:--A slave of noble qualities, and of magnificent\r\nperson, having liberated himself from the degradations of bondage,\r\ndetermined to avenge his own wrongs by inflicting continual terror upon\r\nthe town and neighborhood which had witnessed his humiliation. For this\r\npurpose he resorted to the woody recesses of the province (somewhere in\r\nthe modern Transylvania), and, attracting to his wild encampment as many\r\nfugitives as he could, by degrees he succeeded in training a very\r\nformidable troop of freebooters. Partly from the energy of his own\r\nnature, and partly from the neglect and remissness of the provincial\r\nmagistrates, the robber captain rose from less to more, until he had\r\nformed a little army, equal to the task of assaulting fortified cities.\r\nIn this stage of his adventures he encountered and defeated several of\r\nthe imperial officers commanding large detachments of troops; and at\r\nlength grew of consequence sufficient to draw upon himself the emperor\'s\r\neye, and the honor of his personal displeasure. In high wrath and\r\ndisdain at the insults offered to his eagles by this fugitive slave,\r\nCommodus fulminated against him such an edict as left him no hope of\r\nmuch longer escaping with impunity.\r\n\r\nPublic vengeance was now awakened; the imperial troops were marching\r\nfrom every quarter upon the same centre; and the slave became sensible\r\nthat in a very short space of time he must be surrounded and destroyed.\r\nIn this desperate situation he took a desperate resolution: he assembled\r\nhis troops, laid before them his plan, concerted the various steps for\r\ncarrying it into effect, and then dismissed them as independent\r\nwanderers. So ends the first chapter of the tale.\r\n\r\nThe next opens in the passes of the Alps, whither, by various routes, of\r\nseven or eight hundred miles in extent, these men had threaded their way\r\nin manifold disguises, through the very midst of the emperor\'s camps.\r\nAccording to this man\'s gigantic enterprise, in which the means were as\r\naudacious as the purpose, the conspirators were to rendezvous, and first\r\nto recognize each other, at the gates of Rome. From the Danube to the\r\nTiber did this band of robbers severally pursue their perilous routes\r\nthrough all the difficulties of the road and the jealousies of the\r\nmilitary stations, sustained by the mere thirst of vengeance--vengeance\r\nagainst that mighty foe whom they knew only by his proclamations against\r\nthemselves. Everything continued to prosper; the conspirators met under\r\nthe walls of Rome; the final details were arranged; and those also would\r\nhave prospered but for a trifling accident. The season was one of\r\ngeneral carnival at Rome; and, by the help of those disguises which the\r\nlicense of this festival time allowed, the murderers were to have\r\npenetrated as maskers to the emperor\'s retirement, when a casual word or\r\ntwo awoke the suspicions of a sentinel. One of the conspirators was\r\narrested; under the terror and uncertainty of the moment, he made much\r\nampler discoveries than were expected of him; the other accomplices were\r\nsecured: and Commodus was delivered from the uplifted daggers of those\r\nwho had sought him by months of patient wanderings, pursued through all\r\nthe depths of the Illyrian forests, and the difficulties of the Alpine\r\npasses. It is not easy to find words of admiration commensurate to the\r\nenergetic hardihood of a slave--who, by way of answer and reprisal to an\r\nedict summarily consigning him to persecution and death, determines to\r\ncross Europe in quest of its author, though no less a person than the\r\nmaster of the world--to seek him out in the inmost recesses of his\r\ncapital city, of his private palace, of his consecrated bed-chamber--and\r\nthere to lodge a dagger in his heart, as the adequate reply to the\r\nimperial sentence of proscription against himself.\r\n\r\nSuch, amidst the superhuman grandeur and hallowed privileges of the\r\nRoman emperor\'s office, were the extraordinary perils which menaced the\r\nindividual officer. The office rose by its grandeur to a region above\r\nthe clouds and vapors of earth: the officer might find his personal\r\nsecurity as unsubstantial as those wandering vapors. Nor is it possible\r\nthat these circumstances of violent opposition can be better\r\nillustrated than in this tale of Herodian. Whilst the emperor\'s mighty\r\narms were stretched out to arrest some potentate in the heart of Asia, a\r\npoor slave is silently and stealthily creeping round the base of the\r\nAlps, with the purpose of winning his way as a murderer to the imperial\r\nbed-chamber; C\xc3\xa6sar is watching some potent rebel of the Orient, at a\r\ndistance of two thousand leagues, and he overlooks the dagger which is\r\nwithin three stealthy steps, and one tiger\'s leap, of his own heart. All\r\nthe heights and the depths which belong to man\'s frailty, all the\r\ncontrasts of glory and meanness, the extremities of what is highest and\r\nlowest in human casualties, meeting in the station of the Roman C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nSemper Augustus--have combined to call him into high marble relief, and\r\nto make him the most interesting study of all whom history has\r\nemblazoned with colors of fire and blood, or has crowned most lavishly\r\nwith diadems of cyprus and laurel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV. UNTHOUGHTFULNESS.\r\n\r\nDR. ARNOLD.--1795-1842.\r\n\r\n_A Lecture delivered in Rugby Chapel._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe state of spiritual folly is, I suppose, one of the most universal\r\nevils in the world. For the number of those who are naturally foolish is\r\nexceedingly great; of those, I mean, who understand no worldly thing\r\nwell; of those who are careless about everything, carried about by every\r\nbreath of opinion, without knowledge, and without principle. But the\r\nterm spiritual folly includes, unhappily, a great many more than these;\r\nit takes in not those only who are in the common sense of the term\r\nfoolish, but a great many who are in the common sense of the term\r\nclever, and many who are even in the common sense of the terms, prudent,\r\nsensible, thoughtful, and wise. It is but too evident that some of the\r\nablest men who have ever lived upon earth, have been in no less a degree\r\nspiritually fools. And thus, it is not without much truth that Christian\r\nwriters have dwelt upon the insufficiency of worldly wisdom, and have\r\nwarned their readers to beware, lest, while professing themselves to be\r\nwise, they should be accounted as fools in the sight of God.\r\n\r\nBut the opposite to this notion, that those who are, as it were, fools\r\nin worldly matters are wise before God,--although this also is true in a\r\ncertain sense, and under certain peculiar circumstances, yet taken\r\ngenerally, it is the very reverse of truth; and the careless and\r\nincautious language which has been often used on this subject, has been\r\nextremely mischievous. On the contrary, he who is foolish in worldly\r\nmatters is likely also to be, and most commonly is, no less foolish in\r\nthe things of God. And the opposite belief has arisen mainly from that\r\nstrange confusion between ignorance and innocence, with which many\r\nignorant persons seem to solace themselves. Whereas, if you take away a\r\nman\'s knowledge, you do not bring him to the state of an infant, but to\r\nthat of a brute; and of one of the most mischievous and malignant of the\r\nbrute creation. For you do not lessen or weaken the man\'s body by\r\nlowering his mind; he still retains his strength and his passions, the\r\npassions leading to self-indulgence, the strength which enables him to\r\nfeed them by continued gratification. He will not think, it is true, to\r\nany good purpose; it is very possible to destroy in him the power of\r\nreflection, whether as exercised upon outward things, or upon himself\r\nand his own nature, or upon God. But you cannot destroy the power of\r\nadapting means to ends, nor that of concealing his purposes by fraud or\r\nfalsehood; you take only his wisdom, and leave that cunning which marks\r\nso notoriously both the savage and the madman. He, then, who is a fool\r\nas far as regards earthly things, is much more a fool with regard to\r\nheavenly things; he who cannot raise himself even to the lower height,\r\nhow is he to attain to the higher? he who is without reason and\r\nconscience, how shall he be endowed with the spirit of God?\r\n\r\nIt is my deep conviction and long experience of this truth, which makes\r\nme so grieve over a want of interest in your own improvement in human\r\nlearning, whenever I observe it,--over the prevalence of a thoughtless\r\nand childish spirit amongst you.... The idleness and want of interest\r\nwhich I grieve for, is one which extends itself, but too impartially, to\r\nknowledge of every kind: to divine knowledge, as might be expected, even\r\nmore than to human. Those whom we commonly find careless about their\r\ngeneral lessons, are quite as ignorant and as careless about their\r\nBibles; those who have no interest in general literature, in poetry, or\r\nin history, or in philosophy, have certainly no greater interest, I do\r\nnot say in works of theology, but in works of practical devotion, in the\r\nlives of holy men, in meditations, or in prayers. Alas, the interest of\r\ntheir minds is bestowed on things far lower than the very lowest of all\r\nwhich I have named; and therefore, to see them desiring something only a\r\nlittle higher than their present pursuits, could not but be encouraging;\r\nit would, at least, show that the mind was rising upwards. It may,\r\nindeed, stop at a point short of the highest, it may learn to love\r\nearthly excellence, and rest there contented, and seek for nothing\r\nmore perfect; but that, at any rate, is a future and merely contingent\r\nevil. It is better to love earthly excellence than earthly folly; it is\r\nfar better in itself, and it is, by many degrees, nearer to the Kingdom\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nThere is another case, however, which I cannot but think is more\r\nfrequent now than formerly; and if it is so, it may be worth while to\r\ndirect our attention to it. Common idleness and absolute ignorance are\r\nnot what I wish to speak of now, but a character advanced above these; a\r\ncharacter which does not neglect its school-lessons, but really attains\r\nto considerable proficiency in them; a character at once regular and\r\namiable, abstaining from evil, and for evil in its low and grosser forms\r\nhaving a real abhorrence. What, then, you will say, is wanting here? I\r\nwill tell you what seems to be wanting--a spirit of manly, and much more\r\nof Christian, thoughtfulness. There is quickness and cleverness; much\r\npleasure, perhaps, in distinction, but little in improvement; there is\r\nno desire of knowledge for its own sake, whether human or divine. There\r\nis, therefore, but little power of combining and digesting what is read;\r\nand, consequently, what is read passes away, and takes no root in the\r\nmind. This same character shows itself in matters of conduct; it will\r\nadopt, without scruple, the most foolish, commonplace notions of boys,\r\nabout what is right and wrong; it will not, and cannot, from the\r\nlightness of its mind, concern itself seriously about what is evil in\r\nthe conduct of others, because it takes no regular care of its own, with\r\nreference to pleasing God; it will not do anything low or wicked, but it\r\nwill sometimes laugh at those who do; and it will by no means take\r\npains to encourage, nay, it will sometimes thwart and oppose anything\r\nthat breathes a higher spirit, and asserts a more manly and Christian\r\nstandard of duty.\r\n\r\nOne cause of this consists in the number and character and cheapness,\r\nand peculiar mode of publication, of the works of amusement of the\r\npresent day. The works of amusement published only a very few years\r\nsince were comparatively few in number; they were less exciting, and\r\ntherefore less attractive; they were dearer, and therefore less\r\naccessible; and, not being published periodically, they did not occupy\r\nthe mind for so long a time, nor keep alive so constant an expectation;\r\nnor, by thus dwelling upon the mind, and distilling themselves into it\r\nas it were drop by drop, did they possess it so largely, coloring even,\r\nin many instances, its very language, and affording frequent matter for\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nThe evil of all these circumstances is actually enormous. The mass of\r\nhuman minds, and much more of the minds of young persons, have no great\r\nappetite for intellectual exercise; but they have some, which by careful\r\ntreatment may be strengthened and increased. But here to this weak and\r\ndelicate appetite is presented an abundance of the most stimulating and\r\nleast nourishing food possible. It snatches it greedily, and is not only\r\nsatisfied, but actually conceives a distaste for anything simpler and\r\nmore wholesome. That curiosity which is wisely given us to lead us on to\r\nknowledge, finds its full gratification in the details of an exciting\r\nand protracted story, and then lies down as it were gorged, and goes to\r\nsleep. Other faculties claim their turn, and have it. We know that in\r\nyouth the healthy body and lively spirits require exercise, and in this\r\nthey may and ought to be indulged; but the time and interest which\r\nremain over when the body has had its enjoyment, and the mind desires\r\nits share, this has been already wasted and exhausted upon things\r\nutterly unprofitable: so that the mind goes to its work hurriedly and\r\nlanguidly, and feels it to be no more than a burden. The mere lessons\r\nmay be learnt from a sense of duty; but that freshness of power which in\r\nyoung persons of ability would fasten eagerly upon some one portion or\r\nother of the wide field of knowledge, and there expatiate, drinking in\r\nhealth and strength to the mind, as surely as the natural exercise of\r\nthe body gives to it bodily vigor,--that is tired prematurely,\r\nperverted, and corrupted; and all the knowledge which else it might so\r\ncovet, it now seems a wearying effort to retain.\r\n\r\nGreat and grievous as is the evil, it is peculiarly hard to find the\r\nremedy for it. If the books to which I have been alluding were books of\r\ndownright wickedness, we might destroy them wherever we found them; we\r\nmight forbid their open circulation; we might conjure you to shun them\r\nas you would any other clear sin, whether of word or deed. But they are\r\nnot wicked books for the most part; they are of that class which cannot\r\nbe actually prohibited; nor can it be pretended that there is a sin in\r\nreading them. They are not the more wicked for being published so cheap,\r\nand at regular intervals; but yet these two circumstances make them so\r\npeculiarly injurious. All that can be done is to point out the evil;\r\nthat it is real and serious I am very sure, and its defects are most\r\ndeplorable on the minds of the fairest promise; but the remedy for it\r\nrests with yourselves, or rather with each of you individually, so far\r\nas he is himself concerned. That an unnatural and constant excitement of\r\nthe mind is most injurious, there is no doubt; that excitement involves\r\na consequent weakness, is a law of our nature than which none is surer;\r\nthat the weakness of mind thus produced is and must be adverse to quiet\r\nstudy and thought, to that reflection which alone is wisdom, is also\r\nclear in itself, and proved too largely by experience. And that without\r\nreflection there can be no spiritual understanding, is at once evident;\r\nwhile without spiritual understanding, that is, without a knowledge and\r\na study of God\'s will, there can be no spiritual life. And therefore\r\nchildishness and unthoughtfulness cannot be light evils; and if I have\r\nrightly traced the prevalence of these defects to its cause, although\r\nthat cause may seem to some to be trifling, yet surely it is well to\r\ncall your attention to it, and to remind you that in reading works of\r\namusement, as in every other lawful pleasure, there is and must be an\r\nabiding responsibility in the sight of God; that, like other lawful\r\npleasures, we must beware of excess in it; and not only so, but if we\r\nfind it hurtful to us, either because we have used it too freely in\r\ntimes past, or because our nature is too weak to bear it, that then we\r\nare bound most solemnly to abstain from it; because, however lawful in\r\nitself, or to others who can practise it without injury, whatever is to\r\nus an hindrance in the way of our intellectual and moral and spiritual\r\nimprovement, that is in our case a positive sin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _There is a book, who runs may read, which heavenly truth\r\n        imparts;\r\n    And all the lore its scholars need,--pure eyes and Christian\r\n        hearts.\r\n    The works of God, above, below, within us and around,\r\n    Are pages in that book, to show how God Himself is found._\r\n\r\n        JOHN KEBLE.--1792-1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI.

METAPHYSICS.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CHANDLER HALIBURTON.--1796-1865.\r\n\r\n_From_ TRAITS OF AMERICAN HUMOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Doctor Sobersides, the minister of Pumpkinville, where I lived in my\r\nyouth, was one of the metaphysical divines of the old school, and could\r\ncavil upon the ninth part of a hair about entities and quiddities,\r\nnominalism and realism, free-will and necessity, with which sort of\r\nlearning he used to stuff his sermons and astound his learned hearers,\r\nthe bumpkins. They never doubted that it was all true, but were apt to\r\nsay with the old woman in Moli\xc3\xa8re: "He speaks so well that I don\'t\r\nunderstand him a bit."\r\n\r\nI remember a conversation that happened at my grandfather\'s, in which\r\nthe Doctor had some difficulty in making his metaphysics all "as clear\r\nas preaching." There was my grandfather; Uncle Tim, who was the greatest\r\nhand at raising onions in our part of the country, but "not knowing\r\nmetaphysics, had no notion of the true reason of his not being sad"; my\r\nAunt Judy Keturah Titterwell, who could knit stockings "like all\r\npossest," but could not syllogise; Malachi Muggs, our hired man that\r\ndrove the oxen; and Isaac Thrasher, the district schoolmaster, who had\r\ndropped in to warm his fingers and get a drink of cider. Something was\r\nunder discussion, and my grandfather could make nothing of it; but the\r\nDoctor said it was "metaphysically true."\r\n\r\n"Pray, Doctor," said Uncle Tim, "tell me something about metaphysics; I\r\nhave often heard of that science, but never for my life could find out\r\nwhat it was."\r\n\r\n"Metaphysics," said the Doctor, "is the science of abstraction."\r\n\r\n"I\'m no wiser for that explanation," said Uncle Tim.\r\n\r\n"It treats," said the Doctor, "of matters most profound and sublime, a\r\nlittle difficult perhaps for a common intellect or an unschooled\r\ncapacity to fathom, but not the less important on that account, to all\r\nliving beings."\r\n\r\n"What does it teach?" asked the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"It is not applied so much to the operation of teaching," answered the\r\nDoctor, "as to that of inquiring; and the chief inquiry is, whether\r\nthings are, or whether they are not."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand the question," said Uncle Tim, taking the pipe out\r\nof his mouth.\r\n\r\n"For example, whether this earth on which we tread," said the Doctor,\r\ngiving a heavy stamp on the floor, and setting his foot on the cat\'s\r\ntail, "whether the earth does really exist, or whether it does not\r\nexist."\r\n\r\n"That is a point of considerable consequence to settle," said my\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\n"Especially," added the schoolmaster, "to the holders of real estate."\r\n\r\n"Now the earth," continued the Doctor, "may exist--"\r\n\r\n"Why, who ever doubted that?" asked Uncle Tim.\r\n\r\n"A great many men," said the Doctor, "and some very learned ones."\r\n\r\nUncle Tim stared a moment, and then began to fill his pipe, whistling\r\nthe tune of "Heigh! Betty Martin," while the Doctor went on:\r\n\r\n"The earth, I say, may exist, although Bishop Berkeley has proved beyond\r\nall possible gainsaying or denial, that it does not exist. The case is\r\nclear; the only difficulty is, to know whether we shall believe it or\r\nnot."\r\n\r\n"And how," asked Uncle Tim, "is all this to be found out?"\r\n\r\n"By digging down to the first principles," answered the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Ay," interrupted Malachi, "there is nothing equal to the spade and\r\npickaxe."\r\n\r\n"That is true," said my grandfather, going on in Malachi\'s way, "\'tis by\r\ndigging for the foundation, that we shall find out whether the world\r\nexists or not; for, if we dig to the bottom of the earth and find the\r\nfoundation--why then we are sure of it. But if we find no foundation, it\r\nis clear that the world stands upon nothing, or, in other words, that it\r\ndoes not stand at all; therefore, it stands to reason--"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," interrupted the Doctor, "but you totally mistake\r\nme; I used the word digging metaphorically, meaning the profoundest\r\ncogitation and research into the nature of things. That is the way in\r\nwhich we may ascertain whether things are, or whether they are not."\r\n\r\n"But if a man can\'t believe his eyes," said Uncle Tim, "what signifies\r\ntalking about it?"\r\n\r\n"Our eyes," said the Doctor, "are nothing at all but the inlets of\r\nsensation, and when we see a thing, all we are aware of is, that we have\r\na sensation of it: we are not aware that the thing exists. We are sure\r\nof nothing that we see with our eyes."\r\n\r\n"Not without spectacles," said Aunt Judy.\r\n\r\n"Plato, for instance, maintains that the sensation of any object is\r\nproduced by a perpetual succession of copies, images, or counterfeits,\r\nstreaming off from the object to the organ of sensation. Descartes, too,\r\nhas explained the matter upon the principle of whirligigs."\r\n\r\n"But does the world exist?" asked the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"A good deal may be said on both sides," replied the Doctor, "though the\r\nablest heads are for non-existence."\r\n\r\n"In common cases," said Uncle Tim, "those who utter nonsense are\r\nconsidered blockheads."\r\n\r\n"But in metaphysics," said the Doctor, "the case is different."\r\n\r\n"Now all this is hocus-pocus to me," said Aunt Judy, suspending her\r\nknitting-work, and scratching her forehead with one of the needles, "I\r\ndon\'t understand a bit more of the business than I did at first."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be bound there is many a learned professor," said Uncle Tim,\r\n"could say the same after spinning a long yarn of metaphysics."\r\n\r\nThe Doctor did not admire this gibe at his favorite science.\r\n\r\n"That is as the case may be," said he; "this thing or that thing may be\r\ndubious, but what then? Doubt is the beginning of wisdom."\r\n\r\n"No doubt of that," said my grandfather, beginning to poke the fire,\r\n"and when a man has got through his doubting, what does he begin to\r\nbuild up in the metaphysical way?"\r\n\r\n"Why, he begins by taking something for granted," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"But is that a sure way of going to work?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis the only thing he can do," replied the Doctor, after a pause, and\r\nrubbing his forehead as if he was not altogether satisfied that his\r\nfoundation was a solid one. My grandfather might have posed him with\r\nanother question, but he poked the fire and let him go on.\r\n\r\n"Metaphysics, to speak exactly----"\r\n\r\n"Ah," interrupted the Schoolmaster, "bring it down to vulgar fractions,\r\nand then we shall understand it."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis the consideration of immateriality, or the mere spirit and essence\r\nof things."\r\n\r\n"Come, come," said Aunt Judy, taking a pinch of snuff, "now I see into\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Thus, man is considered, not in his corporeality, but in his essence or\r\ncapability of being; for a man, metaphysically, or to metaphysical\r\npurposes, hath two natures, that of spirituality, and that of\r\ncorporeality, which may be considered separate."\r\n\r\n"What man?" asked Uncle Tim.\r\n\r\n"Why, any man; Malachi there, for example; I may consider him as Malachi\r\nspiritual, or Malachi corporeal."\r\n\r\n"That is true," said Malachi, "for when I was in the militia they made\r\nme a sixteenth corporal, and I carried grog to the drummer."\r\n\r\n"That is another affair," said the Doctor in continuation; "we speak of\r\nman in his essence; we speak, also, of the essence of locality, the\r\nessence of duration--"\r\n\r\n"And essence of peppermint," said Aunt Judy.\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said the Doctor, "the essence I mean is quite a different\r\nessence."\r\n\r\n"Something too fine to be dribbled through the worm of a still," said my\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\n"Then I am all in the dark again," rejoined Aunt Judy.\r\n\r\n"By the spirit and essence of things I mean things in the abstract."\r\n\r\n"And what becomes of a thing when it goes into the abstract?" asked\r\nUncle Tim.\r\n\r\n"Why, it becomes an abstraction."\r\n\r\n"There we are again," said Uncle Tim; "but what on earth is an\r\nabstraction?"\r\n\r\n"It is a thing that has no matter: that is, it cannot be felt, seen,\r\nheard, smelt, or tasted; it has no substance or solidity; it is neither\r\nlarge nor small, hot nor cold, long nor short."\r\n\r\n"Then what is the long and short of it?" asked the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n"Abstraction," replied the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Suppose, for instance," said Malachi, "that I had a pitchfork----"\r\n\r\n"Ay," said the Doctor, "consider a pitchfork in general; that is,\r\nneither this one nor that one, nor any particular one, but a pitchfork\r\nor pitchforks divested of their materiality--these are things in the\r\nabstract."\r\n\r\n"They are things in the hay-mow," said Malachi.\r\n\r\n"Pray," said Uncle Tim, "have there been many such things discovered?"\r\n\r\n"Discovered!" returned the Doctor, "why, all things, whether in heaven,\r\nor upon the earth, or in the waters under the earth, whether small or\r\ngreat, visible or invisible, animate or inanimate; whether the eye can\r\nsee, or the ear can hear, or the nose can smell, or the fingers touch;\r\nfinally, whatever exists or is imaginable in the nature of things, past,\r\npresent, or to come, all may be abstractions."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Uncle Tim, "pray, what do you make of the abstraction of\r\na red cow?"\r\n\r\n"A red cow," said the Doctor, "considered metaphysically or as an\r\nabstraction, is an animal possessing neither hide nor horns, bones nor\r\nflesh, but is the mere type, eidolon, and fantastical semblance of these\r\nparts of a quadruped. It has a shape without any substance, and no color\r\nat all, for its redness is the mere counterfeit or imagination of such.\r\nAs it lacks the positive, so is it also deficient in the accidental\r\nproperties of all the animals in its tribe, for it has no locomotion,\r\nstability, or endurance, neither goes to pasture, gives milk, chews the\r\ncud, nor performs any other function of the horned beast, but is a mere\r\ncreation of the brain, begotten by a freak of the fancy and nourished by\r\na conceit of the imagination."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw!" exclaimed Aunt Judy. "All the metaphysics under the sun\r\nwouldn\'t make a pound of butter!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a fact," said Uncle Tim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _There is no great and no small\r\n    To the Soul that maketh all:\r\n    And where it cometh, all things are:--\r\n    And it cometh everywhere._\r\n\r\n        EMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX.

HORATIUS.[L]\r\n\r\nA LAY MADE ABOUT THE YEAR OF THE CITY CCCLX.\r\n\r\nLORD MACAULAY.--1800-1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lars Porsena of Clusium by the Nine Gods he swore\r\n    That the great house of Tarquin should suffer wrong no more.\r\n    By the Nine Gods he swore it, and named a trysting day,\r\n    And bade his messengers ride forth, east and west and south\r\n              and north,\r\n      To summon his array.\r\n\r\n    East and west and south and north the messengers ride fast,\r\n    And tower and town and cottage have heard the trumpet\'s blast.\r\n    Shame on the false Etruscan who lingers in his home,\r\n    When Porsena of Clusium is on the march for Rome.\r\n\r\n    The horsemen and the footmen are pouring in amain\r\n    From many a stately market-place; from many a fruitful plain;\r\n    From many a lonely hamlet, which, hid by beech and pine,\r\n    Like an eagle\'s nest, hangs on the crest of purple Apennine;\r\n    From lordly Volaterr\xc3\xa6, where scowls the far-famed hold\r\n    Piled by the hands of giants for godlike kings of old;\r\n    From seagirt Populonia, whose sentinels descry\r\n    Sardinia\'s snowy mountain-tops fringing the southern sky;\r\n    From the proud mart of Pis\xc3\xa6, queen of the western waves,\r\n    Where ride Massilia\'s triremes heavy with fair-hair\'d slaves;\r\n    From where sweet Clanis wanders through corn and vines and\r\n              flowers;\r\n    From where Cortona lifts to heaven her diadem of towers.\r\n\r\n    Tall are the oaks whose acorns drop in dark Auser\'s rill;\r\n    Fat are the stags that champ the boughs of the Ciminian hill;\r\n    Beyond all streams Clitumnus is to the herdsman dear;\r\n    Best of all pools the fowler loves the great Volsinian mere.\r\n    But now no stroke of woodman is heard by Auser\'s rill;\r\n    No hunter tracks the stag\'s green path up the Ciminian hill;\r\n    Unwatch\'d along Clitumnus grazes the milk-white steer;\r\n    Unharm\'d the waterfowl may dip in the Volsinian mere.\r\n    The harvests of Arretium, this year, old men shall reap;\r\n    This year, young boys in Umbro shall plunge the struggling sheep;\r\n    And in the vats of Luna, this year, the must shall foam\r\n    Round the white feet of laughing girls whose sires have march\'d\r\n              to Rome.\r\n\r\n    There be thirty chosen prophets, the wisest of the land,\r\n    Who alway by Lars Porsena both morn and evening stand:\r\n    Evening and morn the Thirty have turn\'d the verses o\'er,\r\n    Traced from the right on linen white by mighty seers of yore.\r\n    And with one voice the Thirty have their glad answer given:\r\n    "Go forth, go forth, Lars Porsena; go forth, belov\'d of heaven.\r\n    Go, and return in glory to Clusium\'s royal dome;\r\n    And hang round Nurscia\'s altars the golden shields of Rome."\r\n\r\n    And now hath every city sent up her tale of men:\r\n    The foot are fourscore thousand, the horse are thousands ten.\r\n    Before the gates of Sutrium is met the great array.\r\n    A proud man was Lars Porsena upon the trysting day.\r\n    For all the Etruscan armies were ranged beneath his eye,\r\n    And many a banish\'d Roman, and many a stout ally;\r\n    And with a mighty following to join the muster came\r\n    The Tusculan Mamilius, prince of the Latian name.\r\n\r\n    But by the yellow Tiber was tumult and affright:\r\n    From all the spacious champaign to Rome men took their flight.\r\n    A mile around the city, the throng stopp\'d up the ways;\r\n    A fearful sight it was to see through two long nights and days.\r\n    For aged folks on crutches, and women great with child,\r\n    And mothers sobbing over babes that clung to them and smiled,\r\n    And sick men borne in litters high on the necks of slaves,\r\n    And troops of sun-burn\'d husbandmen with reaping-hooks and staves,\r\n    And droves of mules and asses laden with skins of wine,\r\n    And endless flocks of goats and sheep, and endless herds of kine,\r\n    And endless trains of wagons that creak\'d beneath the weight\r\n    Of corn-sacks and of household goods, choked every roaring gate.\r\n\r\n    Now, from the rock Tarpeian, could the wan burghers spy\r\n    The line of blazing villages red in the midnight sky.\r\n    The Fathers of the City, they sat all night and day,\r\n    For every hour some horseman came with tidings of dismay.\r\n    To eastward and to westward have spread the Tuscan bands;\r\n    Nor house, nor fence, nor dovecote in Crustumerium stands.\r\n    Verbenna down to Ostia hath wasted all the plain;\r\n    Astur hath storm\'d Janiculum, and the stout guards are slain.\r\n    I wis, in all the Senate, there was no heart so bold,\r\n    But sore it ached, and fast it beat, when that ill news was told.\r\n    Forthwith up rose the Consul, up rose the Fathers all;\r\n    In haste they girded up their gowns, and hied them to the wall.\r\n    They held a council standing, before the River-Gate;\r\n    Short time was there, ye well may guess, for musing or debate.\r\n    Out spake the Consul roundly: "The bridge must straight go down;\r\n    For, since Janiculum is lost, nought else can save the town."\r\n\r\n    Just then a scout came flying, all wild with haste and fear:\r\n    "To arms! to arms! Sir Consul: Lars Porsena is here."\r\n    On the low hills to westward the Consul fix\'d his eye,\r\n    And saw the swarthy storm of dust rise fast along the sky.\r\n    And nearer fast and nearer doth the red whirlwind come;\r\n    And louder still and still more loud, from underneath that rolling\r\n              cloud,\r\n    Is heard the trumpet\'s war-note proud, the trampling, and the hum.\r\n    And plainly and more plainly now through the gloom appears,\r\n    Far to left and far to right, in broken gleams of dark-blue light,\r\n    The long array of helmets bright, the long array of spears.\r\n    And plainly and more plainly above that glimmering line,\r\n    Now might ye see the banners of twelve fair cities shine;\r\n    But the banner of proud Clusium was highest of them all,\r\n    The terror of the Umbrian, the terror of the Gaul.\r\n    And plainly and more plainly now might the burghers know,\r\n    By port and vest, by horse and crest, each warlike Lucumo.\r\n    There Cilnius of Arretium on his fleet roan was seen;\r\n    And Astur of the four-fold shield, girt with the brand none else\r\n              may wield,\r\n    Tolumnius with the belt of gold, and dark Verbenna from the hold\r\n      By reedy Thrasymene.\r\n\r\n    Fast by the royal standard, o\'erlooking all the war,\r\n    Lars Porsena of Clusium sat in his ivory car.\r\n    By the right wheel rode Mamilius, prince of the Latian name;\r\n    And by the left false Sextus, that wrought the deed of shame.\r\n    But when the face of Sextus was seen among the foes,\r\n    A yell that rent the firmament from all the town arose.\r\n    On the house-tops was no woman but spat towards him and hiss\'d,\r\n    No child but scream\'d out curses, and shook its little fist.\r\n    But the Consul\'s brow was sad, and the Consul\'s speech was low,\r\n    And darkly look\'d he at the wall, and darkly at the foe.\r\n    "Their van will be upon us before the bridge goes down;\r\n    And if they once may win the bridge, what hope to save the town?"\r\n\r\n    Then out spake brave Horatius, the Captain of the Gate:\r\n    "To every man upon this earth death cometh soon or late.\r\n    And how can man die better than facing fearful odds,\r\n    For the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods,\r\n    And for the tender mother who dandled him to rest,\r\n    And for the wife who nurses his baby at her breast,\r\n    And for the holy maidens who feed the eternal flame,\r\n    To save them from false Sextus that wrought the deed of shame?\r\n    Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul, with all the speed ye may;\r\n    I, with two more to help me, will hold the foe in play.\r\n    In yon strait path a thousand may well be stopp\'d by three.\r\n    Now who will stand on either hand, and keep the bridge with me?"\r\n\r\n    Then out spake Spurius Lartius; a Ramnian proud was he:\r\n    "Lo, I will stand at thy right hand, and keep the bridge with thee."\r\n    And out spake strong Herminius; of Titian blood was he:\r\n    "I will abide on thy left side, and keep the bridge with thee."\r\n\r\n    "Horatius," quoth the Consul, "as thou sayest, so let it be."\r\n    And straight against that great array forth went the dauntless\r\n              Three.\r\n    For Romans in Rome\'s quarrel spared neither land nor gold,\r\n    Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life, in the brave days of old.\r\n    Then none was for a party; then all were for the state;\r\n    Then the great man help\'d the poor, and the poor man lov\'d\r\n              the great:\r\n    Then lands were fairly portion\'d; then spoils were fairly sold:\r\n    The Romans were like brothers in the brave days of old.\r\n    Now Roman is to Roman more hateful than a foe,\r\n    And the Tribunes beard the high, and the Fathers grind the low.\r\n    As we wax hot in faction, in battle we wax cold:\r\n    Wherefore men fight not as they fought in the brave days of old.\r\n\r\n    Now while the Three were tightening their harness on their backs,\r\n    The Consul was the foremost man to take in hand an axe:\r\n    And Fathers mix\'d with Commons seized hatchet, bar, and crow,\r\n    And smote upon the planks above, and loosed the props below.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile the Tuscan army, right glorious to behold,\r\n    Came flashing back the noonday light, rank behind rank, like\r\n              surges bright\r\n        Of a broad sea of gold.\r\n    Four hundred trumpets sounded a peal of warlike glee,\r\n    As that great host, with measured tread, and spears advanced,\r\n              and ensigns spread,\r\n    Roll\'d slowly towards the bridge\'s head, where stood the dauntless\r\n              Three.\r\n\r\n    The Three stood calm and silent, and look\'d upon the foes,\r\n    And a great shout of laughter from all the vanguard rose:\r\n    And forth three chiefs came spurring before that deep array;\r\n    To earth they sprang, their swords they drew, and lifted high their\r\n              shields, and flew\r\n      To win the narrow way;\r\n    Aunus from green Tifernum, lord of the Hill of Vines;\r\n    And Seius, whose eight hundred slaves sicken in Ilva\'s mines;\r\n    And Picus, long to Clusium vassal in peace and war,\r\n    Who led to fight his Umbrian powers from that gray crag where,\r\n              girt with towers,\r\n    The fortress of Nequinum lowers o\'er the pale waves of Nar.\r\n\r\n    Stout Lartius hurled down Aunus into the stream beneath:\r\n    Herminius struck at Seius, and clove him to the teeth:\r\n    At Picus brave Horatius darted one fiery thrust;\r\n    And the proud Umbrian\'s gilded arms clash\'d in the bloody dust.\r\n\r\n    Then Ocnus of Falerii rush\'d on the Roman Three;\r\n    And Lausulus of Urgo, the rover of the sea;\r\n    And Aruns of Volsinium, who slew the great wild boar,\r\n    The great wild boar that had his den amidst the reeds of Cosa\'s fen,\r\n    And wasted fields, and slaughter\'d men, along Albinia\'s shore.\r\n\r\n    Herminius smote down Aruns: Lartius laid Ocnus low:\r\n    Right to the heart of Lausulus Horatius sent a blow.\r\n    "Lie there," he cried, "fell pirate! no more, aghast and pale,\r\n    From Ostia\'s walls the crowd shall mark the track of thy destroying\r\n              bark.\r\n    No more Campania\'s hinds shall fly to woods and caverns when\r\n              they spy.\r\n      Thy thrice accurs\xc3\xa8d sail."\r\n\r\n    But now no sound of laughter was heard among the foes.\r\n    A wild and wrathful clamor from all the vanguard rose.\r\n    Six spears\' lengths from the entrance halted that deep array,\r\n    And for a space no man came forth to win the narrow way.\r\n\r\n    But hark! the cry is Astur: and lo! the ranks divide;\r\n    And the great Lord of Luna comes with his stately stride.\r\n    Upon his ample shoulders clangs loud the four-fold shield,\r\n    And in his hand he shakes the brand which none but he can wield.\r\n\r\n    He smiled on those bold Romans a smile serene and high;\r\n    He eyed the flinching Tuscans, and scorn was in his eye.\r\n    Quoth he, "The she-wolf\'s litter stand savagely at bay:\r\n    But will ye dare to follow, if Astur clears the way?"\r\n    Then, whirling up his broadsword with both hands to the height,\r\n    He rush\'d against Horatius, and smote with all his might.\r\n    With shield and blade Horatius right deftly turn\'d the blow.\r\n    The blow, though turn\'d, came yet too nigh; it miss\'d his helm,\r\n              but gash\'d his thigh:\r\n    The Tuscans raised a joyful cry to see the red blood flow.\r\n    He reel\'d, and on Herminius he lean\'d one breathing-space;\r\n    Then, like a wild-cat mad with wounds, sprang right at Astur\'s face.\r\n    Through teeth, and skull, and helmet, so fierce a thrust he sped,\r\n    The good sword stood a hand-breadth out behind the Tuscan\'s head.\r\n    And the great Lord of Luna fell at that deadly stroke,\r\n    As falls on Mount Alvernus a thunder-smitten oak.\r\n    Far o\'er the crashing forest the giant arms lie spread;\r\n    And the pale augurs, muttering low, gaze on the blasted head.\r\n    On Astur\'s throat Horatius right firmly press\'d his heel,\r\n    And thrice and four times tugg\'d amain, ere he wrench\'d out the\r\n              steel.\r\n    "And see," he cried, "the welcome, fair guests, that waits you here!\r\n    What noble Lucumo comes next to taste our Roman cheer?"\r\n\r\n    But at his haughty challenge a sullen murmur ran,\r\n    Mingled of wrath, and shame, and dread, along that glittering van.\r\n    There lack\'d not men of prowess, nor men of lordly race;\r\n    For all Etruria\'s noblest were round the fatal place.\r\n    But all Etruria\'s noblest felt their hearts sink to see\r\n    On the earth the bloody corpses, in the path the dauntless Three:\r\n    And, from the ghastly entrance where those bold Romans stood,\r\n    All shrank, like boys who unaware, ranging the woods to start a hare,\r\n    Come to the mouth of the dark lair where, growling low, a fierce old\r\n              bear\r\n      Lies amidst bones and blood.\r\n    Was none who would be foremost to lead such dire attack:\r\n    But those behind cried "Forward!" and those before cried "Back!"\r\n    And backward now and forward wavers the deep array;\r\n    And on the tossing sea of steel, to and fro the standards reel;\r\n    And the victorious trumpet-peal dies fitfully away.\r\n\r\n    Yet one man for one moment stood out before the crowd;\r\n    Well known was he to all the Three, and they gave him greeting loud.\r\n    "Now welcome, welcome, Sextus! now welcome to thy home!\r\n    Why dost thou stay, and turn away? here lies the road to Rome."\r\n    Thrice look\'d he at the city; thrice look\'d he at the dead;\r\n    And thrice came on in fury, and thrice turn\'d back in dread;\r\n    And, white with fear and hatred, scowl\'d at the narrow way\r\n    Where, wallowing in a pool of blood, the bravest Tuscans lay.\r\n\r\n    But meanwhile axe and lever have manfully been plied;\r\n    And now the bridge hangs tottering above the boiling tide.\r\n    "Come back, come back, Horatius!" loud cried the Fathers all.\r\n    "Back, Lartius! back, Herminius! back, ere the ruin fall!"\r\n    Back darted Spurius Lartius; Herminius darted back:\r\n    And, as they pass\'d, beneath their feet they felt the timbers crack.\r\n    But when they turn\'d their faces, and on the farther shore\r\n    Saw brave Horatius stand alone, they would have cross\'d once more.\r\n    But with a crash like thunder fell every loosen\'d beam,\r\n    And, like a dam, the mighty wreck lay right athwart the stream:\r\n    And a long shout of triumph rose from the walls of Rome,\r\n    As to the highest turret-tops was splash\'d the yellow foam.\r\n    And, like a horse unbroken when first he feels the rein,\r\n    The furious river struggled hard, and toss\'d his tawny mane,\r\n    And burst the curb, and bounded, rejoicing to be free,\r\n    And whirling down, in fierce career, battlement, and plank, and\r\n              pier,\r\n      Rush\'d headlong to the sea.\r\n\r\n    Alone stood brave Horatius, but constant still in mind;\r\n    Thrice thirty thousand foes before, and the broad flood behind.\r\n    "Down with him!" cried false Sextus, with a smile on his pale face.\r\n    "Now yield thee," cried Lars Porsena, "now yield thee to our grace."\r\n    Round turn\'d he, as not deigning those craven ranks to see;\r\n    Nought spake he to Lars Porsena, to Sextus nought spake he;\r\n    But he saw on Palatinus the white porch of his home;\r\n    And he spake to the noble river that rolls by the towers of Rome.\r\n    "O Tiber! father Tiber! to whom the Romans pray,\r\n    A Roman\'s life, a Roman\'s arms, take thou in charge this day!"\r\n    So he spake, and speaking sheathed the good sword by his side,\r\n    And with his harness on his back plunged headlong in the tide.\r\n\r\n    No sound of joy or sorrow was heard from either bank;\r\n    But friends and foes in dumb surprise, with parted lips and\r\n              straining eyes,\r\n      Stood gazing where he sank;\r\n    And when above the surges they saw his crest appear,\r\n    All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry, and even the ranks of Tuscany\r\n      Could scarce forbear to cheer.\r\n    But fiercely ran the current, swollen high by months of rain:\r\n    And fast his blood was flowing, and he was sore in pain,\r\n    And heavy with his armor, and spent with changing blows:\r\n    And oft they thought him sinking, but still again he rose.\r\n    Never, I ween, did swimmer, in such an evil case,\r\n    Struggle through such a raging flood safe to the landing-place:\r\n    But his limbs were borne up bravely by the brave heart within,\r\n    And our good father Tiber bare bravely up his chin.\r\n\r\n    "Curse on him!" quoth false Sextus; "will not the villain drown?\r\n    But for this stay, ere close of day we should have sack\'d the town!"\r\n    "Heaven help him!" quoth Lars Porsena, "and bring him safe to shore;\r\n    For such a gallant feat of arms was never seen before."\r\n    And now he feels the bottom; now on dry earth he stands;\r\n    Now round him throng the Fathers to press his gory hands;\r\n    And now, with shouts and clapping, and noise of weeping loud,\r\n    He enters through the River-Gate, borne by the joyous crowd.\r\n\r\n    They gave him of the corn-land, that was of public right,\r\n    As much as two strong oxen could plough from morn till night;\r\n    And they made a molten image, and set it up on high,\r\n    And there it stands unto this day to witness if I lie.\r\n    It stands in the Comitium, plain for all folk to see;\r\n    Horatius in his harness, halting upon one knee:\r\n    And underneath is written, in letters all of gold,\r\n    How valiantly he kept the bridge in the brave days of old.\r\n\r\n    And still his name sounds stirring unto the men of Rome,\r\n    As the trumpet-blast that cries to them to charge the Volscian home;\r\n    And wives still pray to Juno for boys with hearts as bold\r\n    As his who kept the bridge so well in the brave days of old.\r\n    And in the nights of winter, when the cold north-winds blow,\r\n    And the long howling of the wolves is heard amidst the snow;\r\n    When round the lonely cottage roars loud the tempest\'s din,\r\n    And the good logs of Algidus roar louder yet within;\r\n    When the oldest cask is open\'d, and the largest lamp is lit;\r\n    When the chestnuts glow in the embers, and the kid turns on the\r\n              spit;\r\n    When young and old in circle around the firebrands close;\r\n    When the girls are weaving baskets, and the lads are shaping bows;\r\n    When the goodman mends his armor, and trims his helmet\'s plume;\r\n    When the goodwife\'s shuttle merrily goes flashing through the loom;\r\n    With weeping and with laughter still is the story told,\r\n    How well Horatius kept the bridge in the brave days of old.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[L] For the sake of space a change has been made from the usual form\r\nof the poem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLII. THE RAVEN.\r\n\r\nEDGAR ALLAN POE.--1809-1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I ponder\'d, weak and weary,\r\n    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,--\r\n    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\r\n    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber-door.\r\n    "\'Tis some visitor," I mutter\'d, "tapping at my chamber-door,--\r\n              Only this, and nothing more."\r\n\r\n    Ah! distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,\r\n    And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\r\n    Eagerly I wish\'d the morrow: vainly I had sought to borrow\r\n    From my books surcease of sorrow,--sorrow for the lost Lenore;\r\n    For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,\r\n              Nameless here forevermore.\r\n\r\n    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\r\n    Thrill\'d me--fill\'d me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\r\n    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,\r\n    "\'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber-door,--\r\n    Some late visitor, entreating entrance at my chamber-door;\r\n              This it is, and nothing more."\r\n\r\n    Presently my soul grew stronger: hesitating then no longer,\r\n    "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\r\n    But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\r\n    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber-door,\r\n    That I scarce was sure I heard you";--here I open\'d wide the door;--\r\n              Darkness there, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering,\r\n        fearing,\r\n    Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\r\n    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\r\n    And the only word there spoken was the whisper\'d word "Lenore?"\r\n    This I whisper\'d, and an echo murmur\'d back the word "Lenore!"\r\n              Merely this, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\r\n    Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than before.\r\n    "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window-lattice;\r\n    Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore,--\r\n    Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore:--\r\n              \'Tis the wind, and nothing more."\r\n\r\n    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\r\n    In there stepp\'d a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.\r\n    Not the least obeisance made he, not a minute stopp\'d or stay\'d he,\r\n    But, with mien of lord or lady, perch\'d above my chamber-door;\r\n    Perch\'d upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber-door;--\r\n              Perch\'d, and sat, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n    Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\r\n    By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\r\n    "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure\r\n        no craven,\r\n    Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven, wandering from the Nightly\r\n        shore;--\r\n    Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night\'s Plutonian shore."\r\n              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n    Much I marvell\'d this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\r\n    Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore;\r\n    For we can not help agreeing that no living human being\r\n    Ever yet was bless\'d with seeing bird above his chamber-door,--\r\n    Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber-door,\r\n              With such name as "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n    But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only\r\n    That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\r\n    Nothing further then he utter\'d, not a feather then he flutter\'d,\r\n    Till I scarcely more than mutter\'d, "Other friends have flown\r\n        before:\r\n    On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."\r\n              Then the bird said, "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\r\n    "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,\r\n    Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful Disaster\r\n    Follow\'d fast, and follow\'d faster, till his songs one burden\r\n        bore,--\r\n    Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore,\r\n              Of--\'Never--Nevermore.\'"\r\n\r\n    But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\r\n    Straight I wheel\'d a cushion\'d seat in front of bird, and bust,\r\n        and door;\r\n    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\r\n    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--\r\n    What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore--\r\n              Meant in croaking "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\r\n    To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burn\'d into my bosom\'s core:\r\n    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\r\n    On the cushion\'s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o\'er;\r\n    But whose velvet violet lining, with the lamp-light gloating o\'er,\r\n              _She_ shall press--ah! nevermore.\r\n\r\n    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\r\n    Swung by seraphim, whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.\r\n    "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath\r\n        sent thee--\r\n    Respite, respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!\r\n    Quaff, Oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"\r\n              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n    "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!\r\n    Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest toss\'d thee here ashore,\r\n    Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted,\r\n    On this home by Horror haunted,--tell me truly, I implore,\r\n    Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead? tell me--tell me, I implore!"\r\n              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n    "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!\r\n    By that heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore,\r\n    Tell this soul, with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aidenn,\r\n    It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore,--\r\n    Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore."\r\n              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n    "Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shriek\'d,\r\n        upstarting,--\r\n    "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night\'s Plutonian shore!\r\n    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\r\n    Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!\r\n    Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my\r\n        door!"\r\n              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\r\n    On the pallid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber-door;\r\n    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon\'s that is dreaming,\r\n    And the lamp-light o\'er him streaming throws his shadow on the\r\n        floor:\r\n    And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n              Shall be lifted--NEVERMORE!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIII. DAVID SWAN--A FANTASY.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL HAWTHORNE.--1804-1864.\r\n\r\n_From_ "TWICE-TOLD TALES."\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can be but partially acquainted even with the events which actually\r\ninfluence our course through life, and our final destiny. There are\r\ninnumerable other events, if such they may be called, which come close\r\nupon us, yet pass away without actual results, or even betraying their\r\nnear approach by the reflection of any light or shadow across our minds.\r\nCould we know all the vicissitudes of our fortunes, life would be too\r\nfull of hope and fear, exultation or disappointment, to afford us a\r\nsingle hour of true serenity. This idea may be illustrated by a page\r\nfrom the secret history of David Swan.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing to do with David until we find him, at the age of\r\ntwenty, on the high road from his native place to the city of Boston,\r\nwhere his uncle, a small dealer in the grocery line, was to take him\r\nbehind the counter. Be it enough to say, that he was a native of New\r\nHampshire, born of respectable parents, and had received an ordinary\r\nschool education, with a classic finish by a year at Gilmanton Academy.\r\nAfter journeying on foot from sunrise till nearly noon of a summer\'s\r\nday, his weariness and the increasing heat determined him to sit down in\r\nthe first convenient shade, and await the coming up of the stage-coach.\r\nAs if planted on purpose for him, there soon appeared a little tuft of\r\nmaples, with a delightful recess in the midst, and such a fresh bubbling\r\nspring, that it seemed never to have sparkled for any wayfarer but David\r\nSwan. Virgin or not, he kissed it with his thirsty lips, and then flung\r\nhimself along the brink, pillowing his head upon some shirts and a pair\r\nof pantaloons, tied up in a striped cotton handkerchief. The sunbeams\r\ncould not reach him; the dust did not yet rise from the road, after the\r\nheavy rain of yesterday; and his grassy lair suited the young man better\r\nthan a bed of down. The spring murmured drowsily beside him; the\r\nbranches waved dreamily across the blue sky overhead; and a deep sleep,\r\nperchance hiding dreams within its depths, fell upon David Swan. But we\r\nare to relate events which he did not dream of.\r\n\r\nWhile he lay sound asleep in the shade, other people were wide-awake,\r\nand passed to an fro, afoot, on horseback, and in all sorts of vehicles,\r\nalong the sunny road by his bed-chamber. Some looked neither to the\r\nright hand nor to the left, and knew not that he was there; some merely\r\nglanced that way, without admitting the slumberer among their busy\r\nthoughts; some laughed to see how soundly he slept; and several, whose\r\nhearts were brimming full of scorn, ejected their venomous superfluity\r\nupon David Swan. A middle-aged widow, when nobody else was near, thrust\r\nher head a little way into the recess, and vowed that the young fellow\r\nlooked charming in his sleep. A temperance lecturer saw him, and wrought\r\npoor David into the texture of his evening\'s discourse, as an awful\r\ninstance of dead-drunkenness by the road-side. But censure, praise,\r\nmerriment, scorn, and indifference, were all one, or rather all nothing,\r\nto David Swan.\r\n\r\nHe had slept only a few moments when a brown carriage, drawn by a\r\nhandsome pair of horses, bowled easily along, and was brought to a\r\nstand-still nearly in front of David\'s resting-place. A linch-pin had\r\nfallen out, and permitted one of the wheels to slide off. The damage was\r\nslight, and occasioned merely a momentary alarm to an elderly merchant\r\nand his wife, who were returning to Boston in the carriage. While the\r\ncoachman and a servant were replacing the wheel, the lady and gentleman\r\nsheltered themselves beneath the maple-trees, and there espied the\r\nbubbling fountain, and David Swan asleep beside it. Impressed with the\r\nawe which the humblest sleeper usually sheds around him, the merchant\r\ntrod as lightly as the gout would allow; and his spouse took good heed\r\nnot to rustle her silk gown, lest David should start up, all of a\r\nsudden.\r\n\r\n"How soundly he sleeps!" whispered the old gentleman. "From what a depth\r\nhe draws that easy breath! Such sleep as that, brought on without an\r\nopiate, would be worth more to me than half my income, for it would\r\nsuppose health and an untroubled mind."\r\n\r\n"And youth besides," said the lady. "Healthy and quiet age does not\r\nsleep thus. Our slumber is no more like his than our wakefulness."\r\n\r\nThe longer they looked, the more did this elderly couple feel interested\r\nin the unknown youth, to whom the wayside and the maple shade were as a\r\nsecret chamber, with the rich gloom of damask curtains brooding over\r\nhim. Perceiving that a stray sunbeam glimmered down upon his face, the\r\nlady contrived to twist a branch aside, so as to intercept it. And\r\nhaving done this little act of kindness, she began to feel like a mother\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n"Providence seems to have laid him here," whispered she to her husband,\r\n"and to have brought us hither to find him, after our disappointment in\r\nour cousin\'s son. Methinks I can see a likeness to our departed Henry.\r\nShall we waken him?"\r\n\r\n"To what purpose?" said the merchant, hesitating. "We know nothing of\r\nthe youth\'s character."\r\n\r\n"That open countenance!" replied his wife, in the same hushed voice, yet\r\nearnestly. "This innocent sleep!"\r\n\r\nWhile these whispers were passing, the sleeper\'s heart did not throb,\r\nnor his breath become agitated, nor his features betray the least token\r\nof interest. Yet Fortune was bending over him, just ready to let fall a\r\nburthen of gold. The old merchant had lost his only son, and had no heir\r\nto his wealth, except a distant relative, with whose conduct he was\r\ndissatisfied. In such cases, people sometimes do stranger things than to\r\nact the magician, and awaken a young man to splendor, who fell asleep in\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\n"Shall we not waken him?" repeated the lady, persuasively.\r\n\r\n"The coach is ready, sir," said the servant, behind.\r\n\r\nThe old couple started, reddened, and hurried away, mutually wondering\r\nthat they should ever have dreamed of doing anything so very ridiculous.\r\nThe merchant threw himself back in the carriage, and occupied his mind\r\nwith the plan of a magnificent asylum for unfortunate men of business.\r\nMeanwhile, David Swan enjoyed his nap.\r\n\r\nThe carriage could not have gone above a mile or two, when a pretty\r\nyoung girl came along with a tripping pace, which showed precisely how\r\nher little heart was dancing in her bosom. Perhaps it was this merry\r\nkind of motion that caused--is there any harm in saying it?--her garter\r\nto slip its knot. Conscious that the silken girth, if silk it were, was\r\nrelaxing its hold, she turned aside into the shelter of the maple-trees,\r\nand there found a young man asleep by the spring! Blushing as red as any\r\nrose, that she should have intruded into a gentleman\'s bed-chamber, and\r\nfor such a purpose, too, she was about to make her escape on tiptoe. But\r\nthere was peril near the sleeper. A monster of a bee had been wandering\r\noverhead--buzz, buzz, buzz--now among the leaves, now flashing through\r\nthe strips of sunshine, and now lost in the dark shade, till finally he\r\nappeared to be settling on the eyelid of David Swan. The sting of a bee\r\nis sometimes deadly. As free-hearted as she was innocent, the girl\r\nattacked the intruder with her handkerchief, brushed him soundly, and\r\ndrove him from the maple shade. How sweet a picture! This good deed\r\naccomplished, with quickened breath, and a deeper blush, she stole a\r\nglance at the youthful stranger, for whom she had been battling with a\r\ndragon in the air.\r\n\r\n"He is handsome!" thought she, and blushed redder yet.\r\n\r\nHow could it be that no dream of bliss grew so strong within him, that,\r\nshattered by its very strength, it should part asunder, and allow him to\r\nperceive the girl among its phantoms? Why, at least, did no smile of\r\nwelcome brighten upon his face? She was come, the maid whose soul,\r\naccording to the old and beautiful idea, had been severed from his own,\r\nand whom, in all his vague but passionate desires, he yearned to meet.\r\nHer only could he love with a perfect love--him only could she receive\r\ninto the depths of her heart--and now her image was faintly blushing in\r\nthe fountain by his side; should it pass away, its happy lustre would\r\nnever gleam upon his life again.\r\n\r\n"How sound he sleeps!" murmured the girl.\r\n\r\nShe departed, but did not trip along the road so lightly as when she\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nNow, this girl\'s father was a thriving country merchant in the\r\nneighborhood, and happened, at that identical time, to be looking out\r\nfor just such a young man as David Swan. Had David formed a wayside\r\nacquaintance with the daughter, he would have become the father\'s clerk,\r\nand all else in natural succession. So here, again, had good\r\nfortune--the best of fortunes--stolen so near, that her garments brushed\r\nagainst him; and he knew nothing of the matter.\r\n\r\nThe girl was hardly out of sight, when two men turned aside beneath the\r\nmaple shade. Both had dark faces, set off by cloth caps, which were\r\ndrawn down aslant over their brows. Their dresses were shabby, yet had a\r\ncertain smartness. These were a couple of rascals, who got their living\r\nby whatever the devil sent them, and now, in the interim of other\r\nbusiness, had staked the joint profits of their next piece of villainy\r\non a game of cards, which was to have been decided here under the trees.\r\nBut, finding David asleep by the spring, one of the rogues whispered to\r\nhis fellow--\r\n\r\n"Hist!--Do you see that bundle under his head?"\r\n\r\nThe other villain nodded, winked, and leered.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet you a horn of brandy," said the first, "that the chap has\r\neither a pocket-book or a snug little hoard of small change, stowed away\r\namongst his shirts. And if not there, we shall find it in his\r\npantaloons\' pocket."\r\n\r\n"But how if he wakes?" said the other.\r\n\r\nHis companion thrust aside his waistcoat, pointed to the handle of a\r\ndirk, and nodded.\r\n\r\n"So be it!" muttered the second villain.\r\n\r\nThey approached the unconscious David, and, while one pointed the dagger\r\ntowards his heart, the other began to search the bundle beneath his\r\nhead. Their two faces, grim, wrinkled, and ghastly with guilt and fear,\r\nbent over their victim, looking horribly enough to be mistaken for\r\nfiends, should he suddenly awake. Nay, had the villains glanced aside\r\ninto the spring, even they would hardly have known themselves, as\r\nreflected there. But David Swan had never worn a more tranquil aspect,\r\neven when asleep on his mother\'s breast.\r\n\r\n"I must take away the bundle," whispered one.\r\n\r\n"If he stirs, I\'ll strike," muttered the other.\r\n\r\nBut, at this moment, a dog, scenting along the ground, came in beneath\r\nthe maple-trees, and gazed alternately at each of these wicked men, and\r\nthen at the quiet sleeper. He then lapped out of the fountain.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw!" said one villain. "We can do nothing now. The dog\'s master must\r\nbe close behind."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s take a drink, and be off," said the other.\r\n\r\nThe man with the dagger thrust back the weapon into his bosom, and drew\r\nforth a pocket-pistol, but not of that kind which kills by a single\r\ndischarge. It was a flask of liquor, with a block-tin tumbler screwed\r\nupon the mouth. Each drank a comfortable dram, and left the spot, with\r\nso many jests, and such laughter at their unaccomplished wickedness,\r\nthat they might be said to have gone on their way rejoicing. In a few\r\nhours they had forgotten the whole affair, nor once imagined that the\r\nrecording angel had written down the crime of murder against their\r\nsouls, in letters as durable as eternity. As for David Swan, he still\r\nslept quietly, neither conscious of the shadow of death when it hung\r\nover him, nor of the glow of renewed life when that shadow was\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nHe slept, but no longer so quietly as at first. An hour\'s repose had\r\nsnatched from his elastic frame the weariness with which many hours of\r\ntoil had burthened it. Now he stirred--now moved his lips, without a\r\nsound--now talked in an inward tone to the noonday spectres of his\r\ndream. But a noise of wheels came rattling louder and louder along the\r\nroad, until it dashed through the dispersing mist of David\'s\r\nslumber--and there was the stage-coach. He started up, with all his\r\nideas about him.\r\n\r\n"Hallo, driver! Take a passenger?" shouted he.\r\n\r\n"Room on top!" answered the driver.\r\n\r\nUp mounted David, and bowled away merrily towards Boston, without so\r\nmuch as a parting glance at that fountain of dreamlike vicissitude. He\r\nknew not that a phantom of Wealth had thrown a golden hue upon its\r\nwaters, nor that one of Love had sighed softly to their murmur, nor that\r\none of Death had threatened to crimson them with his blood--all, in the\r\nbrief hour since he lay down to sleep. Sleeping or waking, we hear not\r\nthe airy footsteps of the strange things that almost happen. Does it not\r\nargue a superintending Providence, that, while viewless and unexpected\r\nevents thrust themselves continually athwart our path, there should\r\nstill be regularity enough in mortal life, to render foresight even\r\npartially available?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV. MY KATE.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.--1809-1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n    She was not as pretty as women I know,\r\n    And yet all your best made of sunshine and snow\r\n    Drop to shade, melt to nought in the long-trodden ways,\r\n    While she\'s still remember\'d on warm and cold days--\r\n              My Kate.\r\n\r\n    Her air had a meaning, her movements a grace;\r\n    You turn\'d from the fairest to gaze on her face:\r\n    And when you had once seen her forehead and mouth,\r\n    You saw as distinctly her soul and her truth--\r\n              My Kate.\r\n\r\n    Such a blue inner light from her eyelids outbroke,\r\n    You look\'d at her silence and fancied she spoke:\r\n    When she did, so peculiar yet soft was the tone,\r\n    Though the loudest spoke also, you heard her alone--\r\n              My Kate.\r\n\r\n    I doubt if she said to you much that could act\r\n    As a thought or suggestion: she did not attract\r\n    In the sense of the brilliant or wise: I infer\r\n    \'Twas her thinking of others, made you think of her--\r\n              My Kate.\r\n\r\n    She never found fault with you, never implied\r\n    Your wrong by her right; and yet men at her side\r\n    Grew nobler, girls purer, as through the whole town\r\n    The children were gladder that pull\'d at her gown--\r\n              My Kate.\r\n\r\n    None knelt at her feet confess\'d lovers in thrall;\r\n    They knelt more to God than they used,--that was all;\r\n    If you praised her as charming, some ask\'d what you meant,\r\n    But the charm of her presence was felt when she went--\r\n              My Kate.\r\n\r\n    The weak and the gentle, the ribald and rude,\r\n    She took as she found them, and did them all good:\r\n    It always was so with her: see what you have!\r\n    She has made the grass greener even here ... with her grave--\r\n              My Kate.\r\n\r\n    My dear one!--when thou wast alive with the rest,\r\n    I held thee the sweetest and lov\'d thee the best:\r\n    And now thou art dead, shall I not take thy part\r\n    As thy smiles used to do for thyself, my sweet Heart--\r\n              My Kate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLV. A DEAD ROSE.\r\n\r\nMRS. BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n        O Rose, who dares to name thee?\r\n    No longer roseate now, nor soft nor sweet,\r\n    But pale and hard and dry as stubble wheat,--\r\n      Kept seven years in a drawer, thy titles shame thee.\r\n\r\n        The breeze that used to blow thee\r\n    Between the hedgerow thorns, and take away\r\n    An odor up the lane to last all day,--\r\n      If breathing now, unsweeten\'d would forego thee.\r\n\r\n        The sun that used to smite thee,\r\n    And mix his glory in thy gorgeous urn\r\n    Till beam appear\'d to bloom, and flower to burn,--\r\n      If shining now, with not a hue would light thee.\r\n\r\n        The dew that used to wet thee,\r\n    And, white first, grow incarnadined because\r\n    It lay upon thee where the crimson was,--\r\n      If dropping now, would darken where it met thee.\r\n\r\n        The fly that \'lit upon thee\r\n    To stretch the tendrils of its tiny feet\r\n    Along thy leafs pure edges after heat,--\r\n      If \'lighting now, would coldly overrun thee.\r\n\r\n        The bee that once did suck thee,\r\n    And build thy perfumed ambers up his hive,\r\n    And swoon in thee for joy, till scarce alive,--\r\n      If passing now, would blindly overlook thee.\r\n\r\n        The heart doth recognize thee,\r\n    Alone, alone! the heart doth smell thee sweet,\r\n    Doth view thee fair, doth judge thee most complete,\r\n      Perceiving all those changes that disguise thee.\r\n\r\n        Yes, and the heart doth owe thee\r\n    More love, dead rose, than to any roses bold\r\n    Which Julia wears at dances, smiling cold:--\r\n      Lie still upon this heart which breaks below thee!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI. TO THE EVENING WIND.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.--1794-1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Spirit that breathest through my lattice, thou\r\n      That cool\'st the twilight of the sultry day,\r\n    Gratefully flows thy freshness round my brow;\r\n      Thou hast been out upon the deep at play,\r\n    Riding all day the wild blue waves till now,\r\n      Roughening their crests, and scattering high their spray,\r\n    And swelling the white sail. I welcome thee\r\n    To the scorch\'d land, thou wanderer of the sea.\r\n\r\n    Nor I alone;--a thousand bosoms round\r\n      Inhale thee in the fulness of delight;\r\n    And languid forms rise up, and pulses bound\r\n      Livelier at coming of the wind of night;\r\n    And languishing to hear thy grateful sound,\r\n      Lies the vast inland stretch\'d beyond the sight.\r\n    Go forth into the gathering shade; go forth,\r\n    God\'s blessing breathed upon the fainting earth!\r\n\r\n    Go, rock the little wood-bird in his nest,\r\n      Curl the still waters, bright with stars, and rouse\r\n    The wide old wood from his majestic rest,\r\n      Summoning from the innumerable boughs\r\n    The strange deep harmonies that haunt his breast;\r\n      Pleasant shall be thy way where meekly bows\r\n    The shutting flower, and darkling waters pass,\r\n    And where the o\'er-shadowing branches sweep the grass.\r\n\r\n    The faint old man shall lean his silver head\r\n      To feel thee; thou shalt kiss the child asleep,\r\n    And dry the moisten\'d curls that overspread\r\n      His temples, while his breathing grows more deep;\r\n    And they who stand about the sick man\'s bed\r\n      Shall joy to listen to thy distant sweep,\r\n    And softly part his curtains to allow\r\n    Thy visit, grateful to his burning brow.\r\n\r\n    Go,--but the circle of eternal change,\r\n      Which is the life of nature, shall restore,\r\n    With sounds and scents from all thy mighty range,\r\n      Thee to thy birthplace of the deep once more;\r\n    Sweet odors in the sea-air, sweet and strange,\r\n      Shall tell the homesick mariner of the shore;\r\n    And, listening to thy murmur, he shall dream\r\n    He hears the rustling leaf and running stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVII.--DEATH OF THE PROTECTOR.[M]\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CARLYLE.--1795-1881.\r\n\r\n_From_ OLIVER CROMWELL\'S LETTERS AND SPEECHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so we have now nothing more;--and Oliver has nothing more. His\r\nSpeakings, and also his Actings, all his manifold Strugglings, more or\r\nless victorious, to utter the great God\'s-Message that was in him,--have\r\nhere what we call ended. This Summer of 1658, likewise victorious after\r\nstruggle, is his last in our World of Time. Thenceforth he enters the\r\nEternities; and rests upon his arms _there_.\r\n\r\nOliver\'s look was yet strong; and young for his years, which were\r\nFifty-nine last April. The "Three-score and ten years," the Psalmist\'s\r\nlimit, which probably was often in Oliver\'s thoughts and in those of\r\nothers there, might have been anticipated for him: Ten Years more of\r\nLife;--which, we may compute, would have given another History to all\r\nthe Centuries of England. But it was not to be so, it was to be\r\notherwise. Oliver\'s health, as we might observe, was but uncertain in\r\nlate times; often "indisposed" the spring before last. His course of\r\nlife had not been favorable to health! "A burden too heavy for man!" as\r\nhe himself, with a sigh, would sometimes say. Incessant toil;\r\ninconceivable labor, of head and heart and hand; toil, peril, and sorrow\r\nmanifold, continued for near Twenty years now, had done their part:\r\nthose robust life-energies, it afterwards appeared, had been gradually\r\neaten out. Like a Tower strong to the eye, but with its foundations\r\nundermined; which has not long to stand; the fall of which, on any\r\nshock, may be sudden.--\r\n\r\nThe Manzinis and Ducs de Crequi, with their splendors, and\r\ncongratulations about Dunkirk, interesting to the street-populations and\r\ngeneral public, had not yet withdrawn, when at Hampton Court there had\r\nbegun a private scene, of much deeper and quite opposite interest there.\r\nThe Lady Claypole, Oliver\'s favorite Daughter, a favorite of all the\r\nworld, had fallen sick we know not when; lay sick now,--to death, as it\r\nproved. Her disease was of a nature, the painfullest and most harassing\r\nto mind and sense, it is understood, that falls to the lot of a human\r\ncreature. Hampton Court we can fancy once more, in those July days, a\r\nhouse of sorrow; pale Death knocking there, as at the door of the\r\nmeanest hut. "She had great sufferings, great exercises of spirit."\r\nYes:--and in the depths of the old Centuries, we see a pale anxious\r\nMother, anxious Husband, anxious weeping Sisters, a poor young Frances\r\nweeping anew in her weeds. "For the last fourteen days" his Highness had\r\nbeen by her bedside at Hampton Court, unable to attend to any public\r\nbusiness whatever. Be still, my Child; trust thou yet in God: in the\r\nwaves of the Dark River, there too is He a God of help!--On the 6th day\r\nof August she lay dead; at rest forever. My young, my beautiful, my\r\nbrave! She is taken from me; I am left bereaved of her. The Lord giveth,\r\nand the Lord taketh away; blessed be the Name of the Lord!--...\r\n\r\nIn the same dark days, occurred George Fox\'s third and last interview\r\nwith Oliver.--.... George dates nothing; and his facts everywhere lie\r\nround him like the leather-parings of his old shop: but we judge it may\r\nhave been about the time when the Manzinis and the Ducs de Crequi were\r\nparading in their gilt coaches, That George and two Friends "going out\r\nof Town," on a summer day, "two of Hacker\'s men" had met them,--taken\r\nthem, brought them to the Mews. "Prisoners there awhile:"--but the\r\nLord\'s power was over Hacker\'s men; they had to let us go. Whereupon:\r\n\r\n"The same day, taking boat I went down" (_up_) "to Kingston, and from\r\nthence to Hampton Court, to speak with the Protector about the\r\nSufferings of Friends. I met him riding into Hampton-Court Park; and\r\nbefore I came to him, as he rode at the head of his Lifeguard, I saw and\r\nfelt a waft" (_whiff_) "of death go forth against him."----Or in favor\r\nof him, George? His life, if thou knew it, has not been a merry thing\r\nfor this man, now or heretofore! I fancy he has been looking, this long\r\nwhile, to give it up, whenever the Commander-in-Chief required. To quit\r\nhis laborious sentry-post; honorably lay-up his arms, and be gone to his\r\nrest:--all Eternity to rest in, O George! Was thy own life merry, for\r\nexample, in the hollow of the tree; clad permanently in leather? And\r\ndoes kingly purple, and governing refractory worlds instead of stitching\r\ncoarse shoes, make it merrier? The waft of death is not against _him_, I\r\nthink,--perhaps against thee, and me, and others, O George, when the\r\nNell-Gwynn Defender and Two Centuries of all-victorious Cant have come\r\nin upon us! My unfortunate George----"a waft of death go forth against\r\nhim; and when I came to him, he looked like a dead man. After I had laid\r\nthe Sufferings of Friends before him, and had warned him according as I\r\nwas moved to speak to him, he bade me come to his house. So I returned\r\nto Kingston; and, the next day, went up to Hampton Court to speak\r\nfarther with him. But when I came, Harvey, who was one that waited on\r\nhim, told me the Doctors were not willing that I should speak with him.\r\nSo I passed away, and never saw him more."\r\n\r\nFriday the 20th of August 1658, this was probably the day on which\r\nGeorge Fox saw Oliver riding into Hampton Park with his Guards, for the\r\nlast time. That Friday, as we find, his Highness seemed much better: but\r\non the morrow a sad change had taken place; feverish symptoms, for which\r\nthe Doctors rigorously prescribed quiet. Saturday to Tuesday the\r\nsymptoms continued ever worsening: a kind of tertian ague, "bastard\r\ntertian" as the old Doctors name it; for which it was ordered that his\r\nHighness should return to Whitehall, as to a more favorable air in that\r\ncomplaint. On Tuesday accordingly he quitted Hampton Court;--never to\r\nsee it more.\r\n\r\n"His time was come," says Harvey; "and neither prayers nor tears could\r\nprevail with God to lengthen out his life and continue him longer to us.\r\nPrayers abundantly and incessantly poured out on his behalf, both\r\npublicly and privately, as was observed, in a more than ordinary way.\r\nBesides many a secret sigh,--secret and unheard by men, yet like the cry\r\nof Moses, more loud, and strongly laying hold on God, than many spoken\r\nsupplications. All which,--the hearts of God\'s People being thus\r\nmightily stirred up,--did seem to beget confidence in some, and hopes in\r\nall; yea some thoughts in himself, that God would restore him."\r\n\r\n"Prayers public and private:" they are worth imagining to ourselves.\r\nMeetings of Preachers, Chaplains, and Godly Persons; "Owen, Goodwin,\r\nSterry, with a company of others, in an adjoining room"; in Whitehall,\r\nand elsewhere over religious London and England, fervent outpourings of\r\nmany a loyal heart. For there were hearts to whom the nobleness of this\r\nman was known; and his worth to the Puritan Cause was evident.\r\nPrayers,--strange enough to us; in a dialect fallen obsolete, forgotten\r\nnow. Authentic wrestlings of ancient Human Souls,--who were alive then,\r\nwith their affections, awestruck pieties; with their Human Wishes, risen\r\nto be _transcendent_, hoping to prevail with the Inexorable. All\r\nswallowed now in the depths of dark Time; which is full of such, since\r\nthe beginning!--Truly it is a great scene of World-History, this in old\r\nWhitehall: Oliver Cromwell drawing nigh to his end. The exit of Oliver\r\nCromwell and of English Puritanism; a great Light, one of our few\r\nauthentic Solar Luminaries, going down now amid the clouds of Death.\r\nLike the setting of a great victorious Summer Sun; its course now\r\nfinished. "_So stirbt ein Held_," says Schiller, "So dies a Hero! Sight\r\nworthy to be worshipped!"--He died, this Hero Oliver, in Resignation to\r\nGod; as the Brave have all done. "We could not be more desirous he\r\nshould abide," says the pious Harvey, "than he was content and willing\r\nto be gone." The struggle lasted, amid hope and fear, for ten days....\r\n\r\nOn Monday August 30th, there roared and howled all day a mighty storm of\r\nwind.... It was on this stormy Monday, while rocking winds, heard in the\r\nsickroom and everywhere, were piping aloud, that Thurloe and an Official\r\nperson entered to enquire, Who, in case of the worst, was to be his\r\nHighness\'s Successor? The Successor is named in a sealed Paper already\r\ndrawn-up, above a year ago, at Hampton Court; now lying in such and such\r\na place. The Paper was sent for, searched for; it could never be found.\r\nRichard\'s is the name understood to have been written in that Paper: not\r\na good name; but in fact one does not know. In ten years\' time, had ten\r\nyears more been granted, Richard might have become a fitter man; might\r\nhave been cancelled, if palpably unfit. Or perhaps it was Fleetwood\'s\r\nname,--and the Paper, by certain parties, was stolen? None knows. On the\r\nThursday night following, "and not till then," his Highness is\r\nunderstood to have formally named "Richard",--or perhaps it might only\r\nbe some heavy-laden "Yes, yes!" spoken, out of the thick death-slumbers,\r\nin answer to Thurloe\'s _question_ "Richard?" The thing is a little\r\nuncertain. It was, once more, a matter of much moment;--giving color\r\nprobably to all the subsequent Centuries of England, this answer!--...\r\n\r\nThursday night the Writer of our old Pamphlet [Harvey] was himself in\r\nattendance on his Highness; and has preserved a trait or two; with which\r\nlet us hasten to conclude. Tomorrow is September Third, always kept as a\r\nThanksgiving day, since the Victories of Dunbar and Worcester. The\r\nwearied one, "that very night before the Lord took him to his\r\neverlasting rest," was heard thus, with oppressed voice, speaking:\r\n\r\n"\'Truly God is good; indeed He is; He will not\'----Then his speech\r\nfailed him, but as I apprehended, it was, \'He will not leave me.\' This\r\nsaying, \'God is good,\' he frequently used all along; and would speak it\r\nwith much cheerfulness, and fervor of spirit, in the midst of his\r\npains.--Again he said: \'I would be willing to live to be farther\r\nserviceable to God and His People: but my work is done. Yet God will be\r\nwith His People.\'\r\n\r\n"He was very restless most part of the night, speaking often to himself.\r\nAnd there being something to drink offered him, he was desired To take\r\nthe same, and endeavor to sleep.--Unto which he answered: \'It is not my\r\ndesign to drink or sleep; but my design is, to make what haste I can to\r\nbe gone.\'--\r\n\r\n"Afterwards, towards morning, he used divers holy expressions, implying\r\nmuch inward consolation and peace; among the rest he spake some\r\nexceeding self-debasing words, _annihilating_ and judging himself. And\r\ntruly it was observed, that a public spirit to God\'s Cause did breathe\r\nin him,--as in his lifetime, so now to his very last."\r\n\r\nWhen the morrow\'s sun rose, Oliver was speechless; between three and\r\nfour in the afternoon, he lay dead. Friday 3rd September 1658. "The\r\nconsternation and astonishment of all people," writes Fauconberg, "are\r\ninexpressible; their hearts seem as if sunk within them. My poor\r\nWife,--I know not what on earth to do with her. When seemingly quieted,\r\nshe bursts out again into a passion that tears her very heart in\r\npieces."--Husht, poor weeping Mary! Here is a Life-battle right nobly\r\ndone. Seest thou not,\r\n\r\n    "The storm is changed into a calm,\r\n    At His command and will;\r\n    So that the waves which raged before\r\n    Now quiet are and still!\r\n\r\n    "Then are _they_ glad,--because at rest\r\n    And quiet now they be:\r\n    So to the haven He them brings\r\n    Which they desired to see."\r\n\r\n"Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord;" blessed are the valiant\r\nthat have lived in the Lord. "Amen, saith the Spirit,"--Amen. "They do\r\nrest from their labors, and their works follow them."\r\n\r\n"Their works follow them." As, I think, this Oliver Cromwell\'s works\r\nhave done and are still doing! We have had our "Revolutions of\r\nEighty-eight," officially called "glorious"; and other Revolutions not\r\nyet called glorious; and somewhat has been gained for poor Mankind.\r\nMen\'s ears are not now slit-off by rash Officiality; Officiality will,\r\nfor long henceforth, be more cautious about men\'s ears. The tyrannous\r\nStar-chambers, branding-irons, chimerical Kings and Surplices at\r\nAll-hallowtide, they are gone, or with immense velocity going. Oliver\'s\r\nworks do follow him!--The works of a man, bury them under what\r\nguano-mountains and obscene owl-droppings you will, do not perish,\r\ncannot perish. What of Heroism, what of Eternal Light was in a Man and\r\nhis Life, is with very great exactness added to the Eternities; remains\r\nforever a new divine portion of the Sum of Things; and no owl\'s voice,\r\nthis way or that, in the least avails in the matter.--But we have to\r\nend here.\r\n\r\nOliver is gone; and with him England\'s Puritanism, laboriously built\r\ntogether by this man, and made a thing far-shining, miraculous to its\r\nown Century, and memorable to all the Centuries, soon goes. Puritanism,\r\nwithout its King, is _kingless_, anarchic; falls into dislocation,\r\nself-collision; staggers, plunges into ever deeper anarchy; King,\r\nDefender of the Puritan Faith there can now none be found;--and nothing\r\nis left but to recall the old disowned Defender with the remnants of his\r\nFour Surplices, and Two Centuries of _Hypocrisis_ (or Play-acting _not_\r\nso-called), and put-up with all that, the best we may. The Genius of\r\nEngland no longer soars Sunward, world-defiant, like an Eagle through\r\nthe storms, "mewing her mighty youth," as John Milton saw her do: the\r\nGenius of England, much liker a greedy Ostrich intent on provender and a\r\nwhole skin mainly, stands with its _other_ extremity Sunward; with its\r\nOstrich-head stuck into the readiest bush, of old Church-tippets,\r\nKing-cloaks, or what other "sheltering Fallacy" there may be, and _so_\r\nawaits the issue. The issue has been slow; but it is now seen to have\r\nbeen inevitable.

EACH AND ALL.\r\n\r\nRALPH WALDO EMERSON.--1803-1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Little thinks, in the field, yon red-cloak\'d clown\r\n    Of thee from the hill-top looking down;\r\n    The heifer that lows in the upland farm,\r\n    Far-heard, lows not thine ear to charm;\r\n    The sexton, tolling his bell at noon,\r\n    Deems not that great Napoleon\r\n    Stops his horse, and lists with delight,\r\n    While his files sweep round yon Alpine height;\r\n    Nor knowest thou what argument\r\n    Thy life to thy neighbor\'s creed has lent.\r\n    All are needed by each one--\r\n    Nothing is fair or good alone.\r\n\r\n    I thought the sparrow\'s note from heaven,\r\n    Singing at dawn on the alder bough;\r\n    I brought him home in his nest, at even,\r\n    He sings the song, but it pleases not now;\r\n    For I did not bring home the river and sky;\r\n    He sang to my ear--they sang to my eye.\r\n\r\n    The delicate shells lay on the shore;\r\n    The bubbles of the latest wave\r\n    Fresh pearls to their enamel gave,\r\n    And the bellowing of the savage sea\r\n    Greeted their safe escape to me.\r\n    I wiped away the weeds and foam--\r\n    I fetch\'d my sea-born treasures home;\r\n    But the poor unsightly, noisome things\r\n    Had left their beauty on the shore,\r\n    With the sun and the sand, and the wild uproar.\r\n\r\n    The lover watch\'d his graceful maid,\r\n    As \'mid the virgin train she stray\'d;\r\n    Nor knew her beauty\'s best attire\r\n    Was woven still by the snow-white choir.\r\n    At last she came to his hermitage,\r\n    Like the bird from the woodlands to the cage;\r\n    The gay enchantment was undone--\r\n    A gentle wife, but fairy none.\r\n\r\n    Then I said, "I covet truth;\r\n    Beauty is unripe childhoods cheat--\r\n    I leave it behind with the games of youth."\r\n    As I spoke, beneath my feet\r\n    The ground-pine curled its pretty wreath,\r\n    Running over the club-moss burrs;\r\n    I inhaled the violet\'s breath;\r\n    Around me stood the oaks and firs;\r\n    Pine-cones and acorns lay on the ground;\r\n    Over me soar\'d the eternal sky,\r\n    Full of light and of deity;\r\n    Again I saw, again I heard,\r\n    The rolling river, the morning bird;\r\n    Beauty through my senses stole--\r\n    I yielded myself to the perfect whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIX. WATERLOO.\r\n\r\nCHARLES JAMES LEVER.--1806-1872.\r\n\r\n_From_ CHARLES O\'MALLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n"This is the officer that I spoke of," said an aid-de-camp, as he rode\r\nup to where I was standing, bare-headed and without a sword. "He has\r\njust made his escape from the French lines, and will be able to give\r\nyour lordship some information."\r\n\r\nThe handsome features and gorgeous costume of Lord Uxbridge were known\r\nto me; but I was not aware, till afterwards, that a soldierlike,\r\nresolute looking officer beside him, was General Graham. It was the\r\nlatter who first addressed me.\r\n\r\n"Are you aware, Sir," said he, "if Grouchy\'s force is arrived?"\r\n\r\n"They had not: on the contrary, shortly before I escaped, an aid-de-camp\r\nwas despatched to Gembloux, to hasten his coming. And the troops, for\r\nthey must be troops, debouching from the wood yonder--they seem to form\r\na junction with the corps to the right--they are the Prussians. They\r\narrived there before noon from St. Lambert, and are part of B\xc3\xbclow\'s\r\ncorps. Count L\xc3\xb6bau and his division of ten thousand men were despatched,\r\nabout an hour since, to hold them in check."\r\n\r\n"This is great news," said Lord Uxbridge. "Fitzroy must know it at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\nSo saying he dashed spurs into his horse, and soon disappeared amid the\r\ncrowd on the hill top.\r\n\r\n"You had better see the Duke, Sir," said Graham: "your information is\r\ntoo important to be delayed. Captain Calvert, let this officer have a\r\nhorse; his own is too tired to go much further."\r\n\r\n"And a cap, I beg of you," added I, in an under tone; "for I have\r\nalready found a sabre."\r\n\r\nBy a slight circuitous route, we reached the road upon which a mass of\r\ndismounted artillery-carts, baggage-wagons, and tumbrils, were heaped\r\ntogether as a barricade against the attack of the French dragoons, who\r\nmore than once had penetrated to the very crest of our position. Close\r\nto this, and on a little rising ground, from which a view of the entire\r\nfield extended from Hougoumont to the far left, the Duke of Wellington\r\nstood, surrounded by his staff. His eye was bent upon the valley before\r\nhim, where the advancing columns of Ney\'s attack still pressed onwards;\r\nwhile the fire of sixty great guns poured death and carnage into his\r\nlines. The second Belgian division, routed and broken, had fallen back\r\nupon the twenty-seventh regiment, who had merely time to throw\r\nthemselves into square, when Milhaud\'s cuirassiers, armed with a\r\nterrible long straight sword, came sweeping down upon them. A line of\r\nimpassable bayonets, a living _chevaux-de-frise_ of the best blood of\r\nBritain, stood firm and motionless before the shock: the French\r\n_mitraille_ played mercilessly on the ranks; but the chasms were filled\r\nup like magic, and in vain the bold horsemen of Gaul galloped round the\r\nbristling files. At length the word "fire!" was heard within the square,\r\nand as the bullets at pistol range rattled upon them, the cuirass\r\nafforded them no defence against the deadly volley. Men and horses\r\nrolled indiscriminately upon the earth: then would come a charge of our\r\ndashing squadrons, who, riding recklessly upon the foe, were, in their\r\nturn, to be repulsed by numbers, when fresh attacks would pour down upon\r\nour unshaken infantry.\r\n\r\n"That column yonder is wavering: why does he not bring up his\r\nsupporting squadrons?" inquired the Duke, pointing to a Belgian regiment\r\nof light dragoons, who were formed in the same brigade with the seventh\r\nhussars.\r\n\r\n"He refuses to oppose his light cavalry to cuirassiers, my lord," said\r\nan aid-de-camp, who had just returned from the division in question.\r\n\r\n"Tell him to march his men off the ground," said the Duke, with a quiet\r\nand impassive tone.\r\n\r\nIn less than ten minutes the regiment was seen to defile from the mass,\r\nand take the road to Brussels, to increase the panic of that city, by\r\ncirculating and strengthening the report, that the English were\r\nbeaten,--and Napoleon in full march upon the capital.\r\n\r\n"What\'s Ney\'s force? can you guess, Sir?" said Lord Wellington turning\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n"About twelve thousand men, my lord."\r\n\r\n"Are the Guard among them?"\r\n\r\n"No, Sir; the Guard are in reserve above La Belle Alliance."\r\n\r\n"In what part of the field is Buonaparte?"\r\n\r\n"Nearly opposite to where we stand."\r\n\r\n"I told you, gentlemen, Hougoumont never was the great attack. The\r\nbattle must be decided here," pointing, as he spoke, to the plain\r\nbeneath us, where still Ney poured on his devoted columns, where yet the\r\nFrench cavalry rode down upon our firm squares.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke an aid-de-camp rode up from the valley.\r\n\r\n"The ninety-second requires support, my lord: they cannot maintain their\r\npositions half an hour longer, without it."\r\n\r\n"Have they given way, Sir?"\r\n\r\n"No----"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, they must stand where they are. I hear cannon towards the\r\nleft; yonder, near Frischermont."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the light cavalry swept past the base of the hill on\r\nwhich we stood, hotly followed by the French heavy cuirassier brigade.\r\nThree of our guns were taken; and the cheering of the French infantry,\r\nas they advanced to the charge, presaged their hope of victory.\r\n\r\n"Do it, then," said the Duke, in reply to some whispered question of\r\nLord Uxbridge; and shortly after the heavy trot of advancing squadrons\r\nwas heard behind.\r\n\r\nThey were the Life Guards and the Blues, who, with the first Dragoon\r\nGuards and the Enniskilleners, were formed into close column.\r\n\r\n"I know the ground, my Lord," said I to Lord Uxbridge.\r\n\r\n"Come along, Sir, come along," said he, as he threw his hussar jacket\r\nloosely behind him, to give freedom to his sword-arm.--"Forward, my men,\r\nforward; but steady, hold your horses in hand; threes about, and\r\ntogether charge."\r\n\r\n"Charge!" he shouted; while, as the word flew from squadron to squadron,\r\neach horseman bent upon his saddle, and that mighty mass, as though\r\ninstinct with but one spirit, dashed like a thunder-bolt upon the column\r\nbeneath them. The French, blown and exhausted, inferior beside in weight\r\nboth of man and horse, offered but a short resistance. As the tall corn\r\nbends beneath the sweeping hurricane, wave succeeding wave, so did the\r\nsteel-clad squadrons of France fall before the nervous arm of Britain\'s\r\ncavalry. Onward they went, carrying death and ruin before them, and\r\nnever stayed their course, until the guns were recaptured, and the\r\ncuirassiers, repulsed, disordered, and broken, had retired beneath the\r\nprotection of their artillery.\r\n\r\nThere was, as a brilliant and eloquent writer on the subject\r\nmentions, a terrible sameness in the whole of this battle. Incessant\r\ncharges of cavalry upon the squares of our infantry, whose sole\r\nmanoeuvre consisted in either deploying into line to resist the\r\nattack of infantry, or falling back into square when the cavalry\r\nadvanced--performing those two evolutions under the devastating fire\r\nof artillery, before the unflinching heroism of that veteran infantry\r\nwhose glories had been reaped upon the blood-stained fields of\r\nAusterlitz, Marengo, and Wagram--or opposing an unbroken front to the\r\nwhirlwind swoop of infuriated cavalry;--such were the enduring and\r\ndevoted services demanded from the English troops, and such they\r\nfailed not to render. Once or twice had temper nearly failed them,\r\nand the cry ran through the ranks, "Are we never to move\r\nforward?--Only let us at them!" But the word was not yet spoken which\r\nwas to undam the pent-up torrent, and bear down with unrelenting\r\nvengeance upon the now exulting columns of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was six o\'clock: the battle had continued with unchanged fortune for\r\nthree hours. The French, masters of La Haye Sainte, could never advance\r\nfurther into our position. They had gained the orchard of Hougoumont,\r\nbut the ch\xc3\xa2teau was still held by the British Guards, although its\r\nblazing roof and crumbling walls made its occupation rather the\r\ndesperate stand of unflinching valor than the maintenance of an\r\nimportant position. The smoke which hung upon the field rolled in slow\r\nand heavy masses back upon the French lines, and gradually discovered to\r\nour view the entire of the army. We quickly perceived that a change was\r\ntaking place in their position. The troops which on their left\r\nstretched far beyond Hougoumont, were now moved nearer to the centre.\r\nThe attack upon the ch\xc3\xa2teau seemed less vigorously supported, while the\r\noblique direction of their right wing, which, pivoting upon Planchenoit,\r\nopposed a face to the Prussians,--all denoted a change in their order of\r\nbattle. It was now the hour when Napoleon was at last convinced that\r\nnothing but the carnage he could no longer support could destroy the\r\nunyielding ranks of British infantry; that although Hougoumont had been\r\npartially, La Haye Sainte, completely, won; that although upon the right\r\nthe farm-houses Papelotte and La Haye were nearly surrounded by his\r\ntroops, which with any other army must prove the forerunner of defeat:\r\nyet still the victory was beyond his grasp. The bold stratagems, whose\r\nsuccess the experience of a life had proved, were here to be found\r\npowerless. The decisive manoeuvre of carrying one important point of\r\nthe enemy\'s lines, of turning him upon the flank, or piercing him\r\nthrough the centre, were here found impracticable. He might launch his\r\navalanche of grape-shot, he might pour down his crashing columns of\r\ncavalry, he might send forth the iron storm of his brave infantry; but,\r\nthough death in every shape heralded their approach, still were others\r\nfound to fill the fallen ranks, and feed with their heart\'s blood the\r\nunslaked thirst for slaughter. Well might the gallant leader of this\r\ngallant host, as he watched the reckless onslaught of the untiring\r\nenemy, and looked upon the unflinching few, who, bearing the proud badge\r\nof Britain, alone sustained the fight, well might he exclaim, "Night,\r\nor Bl\xc3\xbccher!"\r\n\r\nIt was now seven o\'clock, when a dark mass was seen to form upon the\r\nheights above the French centre, and divide into three gigantic\r\ncolumns, of which the right occupied the Brussels road. These were the\r\nreserves, consisting of the Old and Young Guards, and amounting to\r\ntwelve thousand--the _\xc3\xa9lite_ of the French army--reserved by the Emperor\r\nfor a great _coup-de-main_. These veterans of a hundred battles had been\r\nstationed, from the beginning of the day, inactive spectators of the\r\nfight; their hour was now come, and, with a shout of "_Vive\r\nl\'Empereur!_" which rose triumphantly over the din and crash of battle,\r\nthey began their march. Meanwhile, aids-de-camp galloped along the\r\nlines, announcing the arrival of Grouchy, to reanimate the drooping\r\nspirits of the men; for, at last, a doubt of victory was breaking upon\r\nthe minds of those who never before, in the most adverse hour of\r\nfortune, deemed _his_ star could set that led them on to glory.\r\n\r\n"They are coming: the attack will be made on the centre, my lord," said\r\nLord Fitzroy Somerset, as he directed his glass upon the column.\r\nScarcely had he spoke when the telescope fell from his hand, as his arm,\r\nshattered by a French bullet, fell motionless to his side.\r\n\r\n"I see it," was the cool reply of the Duke, as he ordered the Guards to\r\ndeploy into line, and lie down behind the ridge, which now the French\r\nartillery had found the range of, and were laboring at with their guns.\r\nIn front of them the fifty-second, seventy-first, and ninety-fifth were\r\nformed; the artillery, stationed above and partly upon the road, loaded\r\nwith grape, and waited but the word to open.\r\n\r\nIt was an awful, a dreadful moment: the Prussian cannon thundered on our\r\nleft; but so desperate was the French resistance, they made but little\r\nprogress: the dark columns of the Guard had now commenced the ascent,\r\nand the artillery ceased their fire as the bayonets of the grenadiers\r\nshowed themselves upon the slope. Then began that tremendous cheer from\r\nright to left of our line which those who heard never can forget. It was\r\nthe impatient, long-restrained burst of unslaked vengeance. With the\r\ninstinct which valor teaches, they knew the hour of trial was come; and\r\nthat wild cry flew from rank to rank, echoing from the blood-stained\r\nwalls of Hougoumont to the far-off valley of La Papelotte. "They come!\r\nthey come!" was the cry; and the shout of "_Vive l\'Empereur!_" mingled\r\nwith the outburst of the British line.\r\n\r\nUnder an overwhelming shower of grape, to which succeeded a charge of\r\ncavalry of the Imperial Guard, the head of Ney\'s column fired its volley\r\nand advanced with the bayonet. The British artillery now opened at half\r\nrange, and although the plunging fire scathed and devastated the dark\r\nranks of the Guards, on they came,--Ney himself, on foot, at their head.\r\nTwice the leading division of that gallant column turned completely\r\nround, as the withering fire wasted and consumed them; but they were\r\nresolved to win.\r\n\r\nAlready they had gained the crest of the hill, and the first line of the\r\nBritish were falling back before them. The artillery closes up; the\r\nflanking fire from the guns upon the road opens upon them; the head of\r\ntheir column breaks like a shell; the Duke seizes the moment, and\r\nadvances on foot towards the ridge.\r\n\r\n"Up, Guards, and at them!" he cried.\r\n\r\nThe hour of triumph and vengeance had arrived. In a moment the Guards\r\nwere on their feet; one volley was poured in; the bayonets were brought\r\nto the charge; they closed upon the enemy: then was seen the most\r\ndreadful struggle that the history of all war can present. Furious with\r\nlong restrained passion, the guards rushed upon the leading divisions;\r\nthe seventy-first, and ninety-fifth, and twenty-sixth overlapped them on\r\nthe flanks. Their generals fell thickly on every side; Michel, Jamier,\r\nand Mallet are killed: Friant lies wounded upon the ground; Ney, his\r\ndress pierced and ragged with balls, shouts still to advance; but the\r\nleading files waver; they fall back; the supporting divisions thicken;\r\nconfusion, panic succeeds; the British press down; the cavalry come\r\ngalloping up to their assistance; and, at last, pell-mell, overwhelmed\r\nand beaten, the French fall back upon the Old Guard. This was the\r\ndecisive moment of the day;--the Duke closed his glass, as he said:\r\n\r\n"The field is won. Order the whole line to advance."\r\n\r\nOn they came, four deep, and poured like a torrent from the height.\r\n\r\n"Let the Life Guards charge them," said the Duke; but every aid-de-camp\r\non his staff was wounded, and I myself brought the order to Lord\r\nUxbridge.\r\n\r\nLord Uxbridge had already anticipated his orders, and bore down with\r\nfour regiments of heavy cavalry upon the French centre. The Prussian\r\nartillery thundered upon their flank, and at their rear. The British\r\nbayonet was in their front; while a panic fear spread through their\r\nranks, and the cry "_Sauve qui peut!_" resounded on all sides. In vain\r\nNey, the bravest of the brave; in vain Soult, Bertrand, Gourgaud, and\r\nLabedoy\xc3\xa8re, burst from the broken disorganized mass, and called on them\r\nto stand fast. A battalion of the Old Guard, with Cambronne at their\r\nhead, alone obeyed the summons: forming into square, they stood between\r\nthe pursuers and their prey, offering themselves a sacrifice to the\r\ntarnished honor of their arms: to the order to surrender, they answered\r\nwith a cry of defiance; and, as our cavalry, flushed and elated with\r\nvictory, rode round their bristling ranks, no quailing look, no craven\r\nspirit was there. The Emperor himself endeavored to repair the disaster;\r\nhe rode with lightening speed hither and thither, commanding, ordering,\r\nnay imploring too; but already the night was falling, the confusion\r\nbecame each moment more inextricable, and the effort was a fruitless\r\none. A regiment of the Guards, and two batteries were in reserve behind\r\nPlanchenoit; he threw them rapidly into position; but the overwhelming\r\nimpulse of flight drove the mass upon them, and they were carried away\r\nupon the torrent of the beaten army. No sooner did the Emperor see this\r\nhis last hope desert him, than he dismounted from his horse, and,\r\ndrawing his sword, threw himself into a square, which the first regiment\r\nof chasseurs of the Old Guard had formed with a remnant of the\r\nbattalion; Jerome followed him, as he called out:\r\n\r\n"You are right, brother: here should perish all who bear the name of\r\nBuonaparte."\r\n\r\nThe same moment the Prussian light artillery rend the ranks asunder, and\r\nthe cavalry charge down upon the scattered fragments. A few of his\r\nstaff, who never left him, place the Emperor upon a horse,--and fly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Wellington,\r\n    Thy great work is but begun!\r\n    With quick seed his end is rife\r\n    Whose long tale of conquering strife\r\n    Shows no triumph like his life\r\n          Lost and won._\r\n\r\n        DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.--1828-1882.\r\n            _On Wellington\'s Funeral, Nov. 18th, 1852._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLX. THE DIVER.\r\n\r\nEDWARD BULWER, LORD LYTTON.--1805-1873.\r\n\r\n_Translated from the German of Schiller_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "O where is the knight or the squire so bold\r\n      As to dive to the howling Charybdis below?--\r\n    I cast in the whirlpool a goblet of gold,\r\n      And o\'er it already the dark waters flow;\r\n    Whoever to me may the goblet bring,\r\n    Shall have for his guerdon that gift of his king."\r\n\r\n    He spoke, and the cup from the terrible steep,\r\n      That, rugged and hoary, hung over the verge\r\n    Of the endless and measureless world of the deep,\r\n      Swirl\'d into the maelstrom that madden\'d the surge.\r\n    "And where is the diver so stout to go--\r\n    I ask ye again--to the deep below?"\r\n\r\n    And the knights and the squires that gather\'d around,\r\n      Stood silent--and fix\'d on the ocean their eyes;\r\n    They look\'d on the dismal and savage profound,\r\n      And the peril chill\'d back every thought of the prize.\r\n    And thrice spoke the monarch: "The cup to win,\r\n    Is there never a wight who will venture in?"\r\n\r\n    And all as before heard in silence the king,\r\n      Till a youth with an aspect unfearing but gentle,\r\n    \'Mid the tremulous squires stepp\'d out from the ring,\r\n      Unbuckling his girdle, and doffing his mantle;\r\n    And the murmuring crowd, as they parted asunder,\r\n    On the stately boy cast their looks of wonder.\r\n\r\n    As he strode to the marge of the summit, and gave\r\n      One glance on the gulf of that merciless main,\r\n    Lo! the wave that for ever devours the wave,\r\n      Casts roaringly up the Charybdis again:\r\n    And, as with the swell of the far thunder-boom,\r\n    Rushes foamingly forth from the heart of the gloom.\r\n\r\n    And it bubbles and seethes, and it hisses and roars,\r\n      As when fire is with water commix\'d and contending,\r\n    And the spray of its wrath to the welkin up-soars,\r\n      And flood upon flood hurries on, never ending;\r\n    And it never _will_ rest, nor from travail be free,\r\n    Like a sea that is laboring the birth of a sea.\r\n\r\n    Yet, at length, comes a lull o\'er the mighty commotion,\r\n      And dark through the whiteness, and still through the swell,\r\n    The whirlpool cleaves downward and downward in ocean\r\n      A yawning abyss, like the pathway to hell;\r\n    The stiller and darker the farther it goes,\r\n    Suck\'d into that smoothness the breakers repose.\r\n\r\n    The youth gave his trust to his Maker! Before\r\n      That path through the riven abyss closed again,\r\n    Hark! a shriek from the gazers that circle the shore,--\r\n      And, behold! he is whirl\'d in the grasp of the main!\r\n    And o\'er him the breakers mysteriously roll\'d,\r\n    And the giant-mouth closed on the swimmer so bold.\r\n\r\n    All was still on the height, save the murmur that went\r\n      From the grave of the deep, sounding hollow and fell,\r\n    Or save when the tremulous, sighing lament\r\n      Thrill\'d from lip unto lip, "Gallant youth, fare thee well!"\r\n    More hollow and more wails the deep on the ear,--\r\n    More dread and more dread grows suspense in its fear.\r\n\r\n    --If thou shouldst in those waters thy diadem fling,\r\n      And cry, "Who may find it shall win it and wear";\r\n    God wot, though the prize were the crown of a king,\r\n      A crown at such hazard were valued too dear.\r\n    For never shall lips of the living reveal\r\n    What the deeps that howl yonder in terror conceal.\r\n\r\n    Oh, many a bark, to that breast grappled fast,\r\n      Has gone down to the fearful and fathomless grave;\r\n    Again, crash\'d together the keel and the mast,\r\n      To be seen toss\'d aloft in the glee of the wave!--\r\n    Like the growth of a storm ever louder and clearer,\r\n    Grows the roar of the gulf rising nearer and nearer.\r\n\r\n    And it bubbles and seethes, and it hisses and roars,\r\n      As when fire is with water commix\'d and contending;\r\n    And the spray of its wrath to the welkin up-soars,\r\n      And flood upon flood hurries on, never ending,\r\n    And as with the swell of the far thunder-boom,\r\n    Rushes roaringly forth from the heart of the gloom.\r\n\r\n    And, lo! from the heart of that far-floating gloom,\r\n      Like the wing of the cygnet--what gleams on the sea?\r\n    Lo! an arm and a neck glancing up from the tomb!\r\n      Steering stalwart and shoreward: O joy, it is he!\r\n    The left hand is lifted in triumph; behold,\r\n    It waves as a trophy the goblet of gold!\r\n\r\n    And he breath\xc3\xa8d deep, and he breath\xc3\xa8d long,\r\n      And he greeted the heavenly light of the day.\r\n    They gaze on each other,--they shout as they throng,\r\n      "He lives--lo, the ocean has render\'d its prey!\r\n    And safe from the whirlpool, and free from the grave,\r\n    Comes back to the daylight the soul of the brave!"\r\n\r\n    And he comes, with the crowd in their clamor and glee;\r\n      And the goblet his daring has won from the water\r\n    He lifts to the king as he sinks on his knee\r\n      And the king from her maidens has beckon\'d his daughter.\r\n    She pours to the boy the bright wine which they bring,\r\n    And thus spoke the diver; "Long life to the King!\r\n\r\n    "Happy they whom the rose-hues of daylight rejoice,\r\n      The air and the sky that to mortals are given!\r\n    May the horror below nevermore find a voice,--\r\n      Nor man stretch too far the wide mercy of Heaven!\r\n    Nevermore,--nevermore may he lift from the sight\r\n    The veil which is woven with terror and night!\r\n\r\n    "Quick brightening like lightning the ocean rush\'d o\'er me,\r\n      Wild floating, borne down fathom-deep from the day;\r\n    Till a torrent rush\'d out on the torrents that bore me,\r\n      And doubled the tempest that whirl\'d me away.\r\n    Vain, vain was my struggle,--the circle had won me,\r\n    Round and round in its dance the mad element spun me.\r\n\r\n    "From the deep then I call\'d upon God, and He heard me;\r\n      In the dread of my need, He vouchsafed to mine eye\r\n    A rock jutting out from the grave that interr\'d me;\r\n      I sprung there, I clung there,--and death pass\'d me by.\r\n    And, lo! where the goblet gleam\'d through the abyss,\r\n    By a coral reef saved from the far Fathomless.\r\n\r\n    "Below, at the foot of that precipice drear,\r\n      Spread the gloomy and purple and pathless Obscure!\r\n    A silence of horror that slept on the ear,\r\n      That the eye more appall\'d might the horror endure;\r\n    Salamander, snake, dragon--vast reptiles that dwell\r\n    In the deep--coil\'d about the grim jaws of their hell.\r\n\r\n    "Dark crawl\'d, glided dark, the unspeakable swarms,\r\n      Clump\'d together in masses, misshapen and vast;\r\n    Here clung and here bristled the fashionless forms;\r\n      Here the dark-moving bulk of the hammer-fish pass\'d;\r\n    And, with teeth grinning white, and a menacing motion,\r\n    Went the terrible shark,--the hyena of ocean.\r\n\r\n    "There I hung, and the awe gather\'d icily o\'er me,\r\n      So far from the earth, where man\'s help there was none!\r\n    The one human thing, with the goblins before me--\r\n      Alone--in a loneness so ghastly--ALONE!\r\n    Deep under the reach of the sweet living breath,\r\n    And begirt with the broods of the desert of Death.\r\n\r\n    "Methought, as I gazed through the darkness, that now\r\n      IT saw--a dread hundred-limb\'d creature--its prey!\r\n    And darted, devouring; I sprang from the bough\r\n      Of the coral, and swept on the horrible way;\r\n    And the whirl of the mighty wave seized me once more,\r\n    It seized me to save me, and dash to the shore."\r\n\r\n    On the youth gazed the monarch, and marvell\'d: quoth he,\r\n      "Bold diver, the goblet I promised is thine;\r\n    And this ring I will give, a fresh guerdon to thee--\r\n      Never jewels more precious shone up from the mine--\r\n    If thou\'lt bring me fresh tidings, and venture again,\r\n    To say what lies hid in the _innermost_ main."\r\n\r\n    Then out spake the daughter in tender emotion:\r\n      "Ah! father, my father, what more can there rest?\r\n    Enough of this sport with the pitiless ocean:\r\n      He has serv\'d thee as none would, thyself hast confest.\r\n    If nothing can slake thy wild thirst of desire,\r\n    Let thy knights put to shame the exploit of the squire!"\r\n\r\n    The king seized the goblet, he swung it on high,\r\n      And whirling, it fell in the roar of the tide;\r\n    "But bring back that goblet again to my eye,\r\n      And I\'ll hold thee the dearest that rides by my side;\r\n    And thine arms shall embrace as thy bride, I decree,\r\n    The maiden whose pity now pleadeth for thee."\r\n\r\n    And Heaven, as he listen\'d, spoke out from the space,\r\n      And the hope that makes heroes shot flame from his eyes;\r\n    He gazed on the blush in that beautiful face--\r\n      It pales--at the feet of her father she lies!\r\n    How priceless the guerdon!--a moment--a breath--\r\n    And headlong he plunges to life and to death!\r\n\r\n    They hear the loud surges sweep back in their swell,\r\n      Their coming the thunder-sound heralds along!\r\n    Fond eyes yet are tracking the spot where he fell.\r\n      They come, the wild waters, in tumult and throng,\r\n    Roaring up to the cliff,--roaring back as before,\r\n    But no wave ever brings the lost youth to the shore!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI. THE PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS.\r\n\r\nCARDINAL NEWMAN.--1801-\r\n\r\n_From_ CALLISTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuba\'s finger was directed to a spot where, amid the thick foliage, the\r\ngleam of a pool or of a marsh was visible. The various waters round\r\nabout, issuing from the gravel, or drained from the nightly damps, had\r\nrun into a hollow, filled with the decaying vegetation of former years.\r\nIts banks were bordered with a deep, broad layer of mud, a transition\r\nsubstance between the rich vegetable matter which it once had been, and\r\nthe multitudinous world of insect life which it was becoming. A cloud or\r\nmist at this time was hanging over it, high in air. A harsh and shrill\r\nsound, a whizzing or a chirping, proceeded from that cloud to the ear of\r\nthe attentive listener. What these indications portended was plain....\r\n\r\nThe plague of locusts, one of the most awful visitations to which the\r\ncountries included in the Roman empire were exposed, extended from the\r\nAtlantic to Ethiopia, from Arabia to India, and from the Nile and Red\r\nSea to Greece and the north of Asia Minor. Instances are recorded in\r\nhistory of clouds of the devastating insect crossing the Black Sea to\r\nPoland, and the Mediterranean to Lombardy. It is as numerous in its\r\nspecies as it is wide in its range of territory. Brood follows brood,\r\nwith a sort of family likeness, yet with distinct attributes. It wakens\r\ninto existence and activity as early as the month of March; but\r\ninstances are not wanting, as in our present history, of its appearance\r\nas late as June. Even one flight comprises myriads upon myriads passing\r\nimagination, to which the drops of rain or the sands of the sea are the\r\nonly fit comparison; and hence it is almost a proverbial mode of\r\nexpression in the East, by way of describing a vast invading army, to\r\nliken it to the locusts. So dense are they, when upon the wing, that it\r\nis no exaggeration to say that they hide the sun, from which\r\ncircumstance indeed their name in Arabic is derived. And so ubiquitous\r\nare they when they have alighted on the earth, that they simply cover or\r\nclothe its surface.\r\n\r\nThis last characteristic is stated in the sacred account of the plagues\r\nof Egypt, where their faculty of devastation is also mentioned. The\r\ncorrupting fly and the bruising and prostrating hail preceded them in\r\nthat series of visitations, but _they_ came to do the work of ruin more\r\nthoroughly. For not only the crops and fruits, but the foliage of the\r\nforest itself, nay, the small twigs and the bark of the trees are the\r\nvictims of their curious and energetic rapacity. They have been known\r\neven to gnaw the door-posts of the houses. Nor do they execute their\r\ntask in so slovenly a way, that, as they have succeeded other plagues,\r\nso they may have successors themselves. They take pains to spoil what\r\nthey leave. Like the Harpies, they smear every thing that they touch\r\nwith a miserable slime, which has the effect of a virus in corroding, or\r\nas some say, in scorching and burning. And then, perhaps, as if all this\r\nwere little, when they can do nothing else, they die; as if out of sheer\r\nmalevolence to man, for the poisonous elements of their nature are then\r\nlet loose and dispersed abroad, and create a pestilence; and they manage\r\nto destroy many more by their death than in their life.\r\n\r\nSuch are the locusts. And now they are rushing upon a considerable tract\r\nof that beautiful region of which we have spoken with such admiration.\r\nThe swarm to which Juba pointed grew and grew till it became a compact\r\nbody, as much as a furlong square; yet it was but the vanguard of a\r\nseries of similar hosts, formed one after another out of the hot mould\r\nor sand, rising into the air like clouds, enlarging into a dusky canopy,\r\nand then discharged against the fruitful plain. At length the huge\r\ninnumerous mass was put into motion, and began its career, darkening the\r\nface of day. As became an instrument of divine power, it seemed to have\r\nno volition of its own; it was set off, it drifted, with the wind, and\r\nthus made northwards, straight for Sicca. Thus they advanced, host after\r\nhost, for a time wafted on the air, and gradually declining to the\r\nearth, while fresh broods were carried over the first, and neared the\r\nearth, after a longer flight, in their turn. For twelve miles did they\r\nextend from front to rear, and their whizzing and hissing could be heard\r\nfor six miles on every side of them. The bright sun, though hidden by\r\nthem, illumined their bodies, and was reflected from their quivering\r\nwings; and as they heavily fell earthward, they seemed like the\r\ninnumerable flakes of a yellow-colored snow. And like snow did they\r\ndescend, a living carpet, or rather pall, upon fields, crops, gardens,\r\ncopses, groves, orchards, vineyards, olive woods, orangeries, palm\r\nplantations, and the deep forests, sparing nothing within their reach,\r\nand where there was nothing to devour, lying helpless in drifts, or\r\ncrawling forward obstinately, as they best might, with the hope of prey.\r\nThey could spare their hundred thousand soldiers twice or thrice over,\r\nand not miss them; their masses filled the bottoms of the ravines and\r\nhollow ways, impeding the traveller as he rode forward on his journey\r\nand trampled by thousands under his horse-hoofs. In vain was all this\r\noverthrow and waste by the roadside, in vain their loss in river, pool,\r\nand watercourse. The poor peasants hastily dug pits and trenches as\r\ntheir enemy came on; in vain they filled them from the wells or with\r\nlighted stubble. Heavily and thickly did the locusts fall; they were\r\nlavish of their lives; they choked the flame and the water, which\r\ndestroyed them the while, and the vast living hostile armament still\r\nmoved on.\r\n\r\nThey moved right on like soldiers in their ranks, stopping at nothing,\r\nand straggling for nothing; they carried a broad furrow or wheal all\r\nacross the country, black and loathsome, while it was as green and\r\nsmiling on each side of them and in front, as it had been before they\r\ncame. Before them, in the language of prophets, was a paradise, and\r\nbehind them a desert. They are daunted by nothing they surmount walls\r\nand hedges, and enter enclosed gardens or inhabited houses. A rare and\r\nexperimental vineyard has been planted in a sheltered grove. The high\r\nwinds of Africa will not commonly allow the light trellice or the slim\r\npole; but here the lofty poplar of Campania has been possible, on which\r\nthe vine plant mounts so many yards into the air, that the poor\r\ngrape-gatherers bargain for a funeral pile and a tomb as one of the\r\nconditions of their engagement. The locusts have done what the winds and\r\nlightning could not do, and the whole promise of the vintage, leaves and\r\nall, is gone, and the slender stems are left bare. There is another\r\nyard, less uncommon, but still tended with more than common care; each\r\nplant is kept within due bounds by a circular trench round it, and by\r\nupright canes on which it is to trail; in an hour the solicitude and\r\nlong toil of the vine-dresser are lost, and his pride humbled. There is\r\na smiling farm; another sort of vine, of remarkable character, is found\r\nagainst the farmhouse. This vine springs from one root, and has clothed\r\nand matted with its many branches the four walls. The whole of it is\r\ncovered thick with long clusters, which another month will ripen. On\r\nevery grape and leaf there is a locust. Into the dry caves and pits,\r\ncarefully strewed with straw, the harvest-men have (safely, as they\r\nthought just now) been lodging the far-famed African wheat. One grain or\r\nroot shoots up into ten, twenty, fifty, eighty, nay, three or four\r\nhundred stalks: sometimes the stalks have two ears apiece, and these\r\nshoot into a number of lesser ones. These stores are intended for the\r\nRoman populace, but the locusts have been beforehand with them. The\r\nsmall patches of ground belonging to the poor peasants up and down the\r\ncountry, for raising the turnips, garlic, barley, water-melons, on which\r\nthey live, are the prey of these glutton invaders as much as the\r\nchoicest vines and olives. Nor have they any reverence for the villa of\r\nthe civic decurion or the Roman official. The neatly arranged kitchen\r\ngarden, with its cherries, plums, peaches, and apricots, is a waste; as\r\nthe slaves sit round, in the kitchen in the first court, at their coarse\r\nevening meal, the room is filled with the invading force, and news comes\r\nto them that the enemy has fallen upon the apples and pears in the\r\nbasement, and is at the same time plundering and sacking the preserves\r\nof quince and pomegranate, and revelling in the jars of precious oil of\r\nCyprus and Mendes in the store-rooms.\r\n\r\nThey come up to the walls of Sicca, and are flung against them into the\r\nditch. Not a moment\'s hesitation or delay; they recover their footing,\r\nthey climb up the wood or stucco, they surmount the parapet, or they\r\nhave entered in at the windows, filling the apartments, and the most\r\nprivate and luxurious chambers, not one or two, like stragglers at\r\nforage or rioters after a victory, but in order of battle, and with the\r\narray of an army. Choice plants or flowers about the _impluvia_ and\r\n_xysti_, for ornament or refreshment, myrtles, oranges, pomegranates,\r\nthe rose and the carnation, have disappeared. They dim the bright\r\nmarbles of the walls and the gilding of the ceilings. They enter the\r\ntriclinium in the midst of the banquet; they crawl over the viands and\r\nspoil what they do not devour. Unrelaxed by success and by enjoyment,\r\nonward they go; a secret mysterious instinct keeps them together, as if\r\nthey had a king over them. They move along the floor in so strange an\r\norder that they seem to be a tessellated pavement themselves, and to be\r\nthe artificial embellishment of the place; so true are their lines, and\r\nso perfect is the pattern they describe. Onward they go, to the market,\r\nto the temple sacrifices, to the bakers\' stores, to the cookshops, to\r\nthe confectioners, to the druggists; nothing comes amiss to them;\r\nwherever man has aught to eat or drink, there are they, reckless of\r\ndeath, strong of appetite, certain of conquest....\r\n\r\nAnother and a still worse calamity. The invaders, as we have already\r\nhinted, could be more terrible still in their overthrow than in their\r\nravages. The inhabitants of the country had attempted, where they could,\r\nto destroy them by fire and water. It would seem as if the malignant\r\nanimals had resolved that the sufferers should have the benefit of this\r\npolicy to the full; for they had not got more than twenty miles beyond\r\nSicca when they suddenly sickened and died. When they thus had done all\r\nthe mischief they could by their living, when they thus had made their\r\nfoul maws the grave of every living thing, next they died themselves,\r\nand made the desolated land their own grave. They took from it its\r\nhundred forms and varieties of beautiful life, and left it their own\r\nfetid and poisonous carcases in payment. It was a sudden catastrophe;\r\nthey seemed making for the Mediterranean, as if, like other great\r\nconquerors, they had other worlds to subdue beyond it; but, whether they\r\nwere overgorged, or struck by some atmospheric change, or that their\r\ntime was come and they paid the debt of nature, so it was that suddenly\r\nthey fell, and their glory came to nought, and all was vanity to them as\r\nto others, and "their stench rose up, and their corruption rose up,\r\nbecause they had done proudly."\r\n\r\nThe hideous swarms lay dead in the moist steaming underwoods, in the\r\ngreen swamps, in the sheltered valleys, in the ditches and furrows of\r\nthe fields, amid the monuments of their own prowess, the ruined crops\r\nand the dishonored vineyards. A poisonous element, issuing from their\r\nremains, mingled with the atmosphere, and corrupted it. The dismayed\r\npeasant found that a plague had begun; a new visitation, not confined to\r\nthe territory which the enemy had made its own, but extending far and\r\nwide, as the atmosphere extends, in all directions. Their daily toil, no\r\nlonger claimed by the fruits of the earth, which have ceased to exist,\r\nis now devoted to the object of ridding themselves of the deadly legacy\r\nwhich they have received in their stead. In vain; it is their last toil;\r\nthey are digging pits, they are raising piles, for their own corpses, as\r\nwell as for the bodies of their enemies. Invader and victim lie in the\r\nsame grave, burn in the same heap; they sicken while they work, and the\r\npestilence spreads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXII. THE CANE-BOTTOM\'D CHAIR.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY.--1811-1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In tatter\'d old slippers that toast at the bars,\r\n    And a ragged old jacket perfumed with cigars,\r\n    Away from the world and its toils and its cares,\r\n    I\'ve a snug little kingdom up four pair of stairs.\r\n\r\n    To mount to this realm is a toil, to be sure,\r\n    But the fire there is bright and the air rather pure;\r\n    And the view I behold on a sunshiny day\r\n    Is grand through the chimney-pots over the way.\r\n\r\n    This snug little chamber is cramm\'d in all nooks\r\n    With worthless old knicknacks and silly old books,\r\n    And foolish old odds and foolish old ends,\r\n    Crack\'d bargains from brokers, cheap keepsakes from friends.\r\n\r\n    Old armor, prints, pictures, pipes, china, (all crack\'d,)\r\n    Old rickety tables, and chairs broken-back\'d;\r\n    A twopenny treasury, wondrous to see;\r\n    What matter? \'tis pleasant to you, friend, and me.\r\n\r\n    No better divan need the Sultan require,\r\n    Than the creaking old sofa that basks by the fire;\r\n    And \'tis wonderful, surely, what music you get\r\n    From the rickety, ramshackle, wheezy spinet.\r\n\r\n    That praying-rug came from a Turcoman\'s camp;\r\n    By Tiber once twinkled that brazen old lamp;\r\n    A Mameluke fierce yonder dagger has drawn:\r\n    \'Tis a murderous knife to toast muffins upon.\r\n\r\n    Long, long through the hours, and the night, and the chimes,\r\n    Here we talk of old books, and old friends, and old times;\r\n    As we sit in a fog made of rich Latakie\r\n    This chamber is pleasant to you, friend, and me.\r\n\r\n    But of all the cheap treasures that garnish my nest,\r\n    There\'s one that I love and I cherish the best;\r\n    For the finest of couches that\'s padded with hair\r\n    I never would change thee, my cane-bottom\'d chair.\r\n\r\n    \'Tis a bandy-legg\'d, high-shoulder\'d, worm-eaten seat,\r\n    With a creaking old back, and twisted old feet;\r\n    But since the fair morning when Fanny sat there,\r\n    I bless thee, and love thee, old cane-bottom\'d chair.\r\n\r\n    If chairs have but feeling, in holding such charms,\r\n    A thrill must have pass\'d through your wither\'d old arms!\r\n    I look\'d, and I long\'d, and I wish\'d in despair;\r\n    I wish\'d myself turn\'d to a cane-bottom\'d chair.\r\n\r\n    It was but a moment she sat in this place,\r\n    She\'d a scarf on her neck, and a smile on her face!\r\n    A smile on her face, and a rose in her hair,\r\n    And she sat there, and bloom\'d in my cane-bottom\'d chair.\r\n\r\n    And so I have valued my chair ever since,\r\n    Like the shrine of a saint, or the throne of a prince;\r\n    Saint Fanny, my patroness sweet I declare,\r\n    The queen of my heart and my cane-bottom\'d chair.\r\n\r\n    When the candles burn low, and the company\'s gone,\r\n    In the silence of night as I sit here alone--\r\n    I sit here alone, but we yet are a pair--\r\n    My Fanny I see in my cane-bottom\'d chair.\r\n\r\n    She comes from the past and revisits my room;\r\n    She looks as she then did, all beauty and bloom;\r\n    So smiling and tender, so fresh and so fair,\r\n    And yonder she sits in my cane-bottom\'d chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIII. THE RECONCILIATION.[N]\r\n\r\nTHACKERAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was scarce a score of persons in the Cathedral beside the Dean and\r\nsome of his clergy, and the choristers, young and old, that performed\r\nthe beautiful evening prayer. But Mr. Tusher was one of the officiants,\r\nand read from the eagle in an authoritative voice, and a great black\r\nperiwig; and in the stalls, still in her black widow\'s hood, sat\r\nEsmond\'s dear mistress, her son by her side, very much grown, and indeed\r\na noble-looking youth, with his mother\'s eyes, and his father\'s curling\r\nbrown hair, that fell over his _point de Venise_--a pretty picture such\r\nas Vandyke might have painted. Mons. Rigaud\'s portrait of my Lord\r\nViscount, done at Paris afterwards, gives but a French version of his\r\nmanly, frank English face. When he looked up there were two sapphire\r\nbeams out of his eyes such as no painter\'s palette has the color to\r\nmatch, I think. On this day there was not much chance of seeing that\r\nparticular beauty of my young lord\'s countenance; for the truth is, he\r\nkept his eyes shut for the most part, and, the anthem being rather long,\r\nwas asleep.\r\n\r\nBut the music ceasing, my lord woke up, looking about him, and his eyes\r\nlighting on Mr. Esmond, who was sitting opposite him, gazing with no\r\nsmall tenderness and melancholy upon two persons who had so much of his\r\nheart for so many years, Lord Castlewood, with a start; pulled at his\r\nmother\'s sleeve (her face had scarce been lifted from her book), and\r\nsaid, "Look, mother!" so loud, that Esmond could hear on the other side\r\nof the church, and the old Dean on his throned stall. Lady Castlewood\r\nlooked for an instant as her son bade her, and held up a warning finger\r\nto Frank; Esmond felt his whole face flush, and his heart throbbing, as\r\nthat dear lady beheld him once more. The rest of the prayers were\r\nspeedily over; Mr. Esmond did not hear them; nor did his mistress, very\r\nlikely, whose hood went more closely over her face, and who never lifted\r\nher head again until the service was over, the blessing given, and Mr.\r\nDean, and his procession of ecclesiastics, out of the inner chapel.\r\n\r\nYoung Castlewood came clambering over the stalls before the clergy were\r\nfairly gone, and running up to Esmond, eagerly embraced him. "My dear,\r\ndearest old Harry!" he said, "are you come back? Have you been to the\r\nwars? You\'ll take me with you when you go again? Why didn\'t you write to\r\nus? Come to mother."\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond could hardly say more than a "God bless you, my boy," for his\r\nheart was very full and grateful at all this tenderness on the lad\'s\r\npart; and he was as much moved at seeing Frank as he was fearful about\r\nthat other interview which was now to take place: for he knew not if the\r\nwidow would reject him as she had done so cruelly a year ago.\r\n\r\n"It was kind of you to come back to us, Henry," Lady Esmond said. "I\r\nthought you might come."\r\n\r\n"We read of the fleet coming to Portsmouth. Why did you not come from\r\nPortsmouth?" Frank asked, or my Lord Viscount, as he now must be called.\r\n\r\nEsmond had thought of that too. He would have given one of his eyes so\r\nthat he might see his dear friends again once more; but believing that\r\nhis mistress had forbidden him her house, he had obeyed her, and\r\nremained at a distance.\r\n\r\n"You had but to ask, and you knew I would be here," he said.\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand, her little fair hand: there was only her marriage\r\nring on it. The quarrel was all over. The year of grief and estrangement\r\nwas passed. They never had been separated. His mistress had never been\r\nout of his mind all that time. No, not once. No, not in the prison; nor\r\nin the camp; nor on shore before the enemy; nor at sea under the stars\r\nof solemn midnight; nor as he watched the glorious rising of the dawn:\r\nnot even at the table, where he sat carousing with friends, or at the\r\ntheatre yonder, where he tried to fancy that other eyes were brighter\r\nthan hers. Brighter eyes there might be, and faces more beautiful, but\r\nnone so dear--no voice so sweet as that of his beloved mistress, who had\r\nbeen sister, mother, goddess to him during his youth--goddess now no\r\nmore, for he knew of her weaknesses; and by thought, by suffering, and\r\nthat experience it brings, was older now than she; but more fondly\r\ncherished as woman perhaps than ever she had been adored as divinity.\r\nWhat is it? Where lies it? the secret which makes one little hand the\r\ndearest of all? Who ever can unriddle that mystery? Here she was, her\r\nson by his side, his dear boy. Here she was, weeping and happy. She took\r\nhis hand in both hers; he felt her tears. It was a rapture of\r\nreconciliation....\r\n\r\n"And Harry\'s coming home to supper. Huzzay! huzzay!" cries my lord.\r\n"Mother, I shall run home and bid Beatrix put her ribbons on. Beatrix is\r\na maid of honor, Harry. Such a fine set-up minx!"\r\n\r\n"Your heart was never in the Church, Harry," the widow said, in her\r\nsweet low tone, as they walked away together. (Now, it seemed they had\r\nnever been parted, and again, as if they had been ages asunder.) "I\r\nalways thought you had no vocation that way; and that \'twas a pity to\r\nshut you out from the world. You would but have pined and chafed at\r\nCastlewood: and \'tis better you should make a name for yourself. I often\r\nsaid so to my dear lord. How he loved you! \'Twas my lord that made you\r\nstay with us."\r\n\r\n"I asked no better than to stay near you always," said Mr. Esmond.\r\n\r\n"But to go was best, Harry. When the world cannot give peace, you will\r\nknow where to find it; but one of your strong imagination and eager\r\ndesires must try the world first before he tires of it. \'Twas not to be\r\nthought of, or if it once was, it was only by my selfishness, that you\r\nshould remain as chaplain to a country gentleman and tutor to a little\r\nboy. You are of the blood of the Esmonds, kinsman; and that was always\r\nwild in youth. Look at Francis. He is but fifteen, and I scarce can keep\r\nhim in my nest. His talk is all of war and pleasure, and he longs to\r\nserve in the next campaign. Perhaps he and the young Lord Churchill\r\nshall go the next. Lord Marlborough has been good to us. You know how\r\nkind they were in my misfortune. And so was your--your father\'s widow.\r\nNo one knows how good the world is, till grief comes to try us. \'Tis\r\nthrough my Lady Marlborough\'s goodness that Beatrix hath her place at\r\nCourt; and Frank is under my Lord Chamberlain. And the dowager lady,\r\nyour father\'s widow, has promised to provide for you--has she not?"\r\n\r\nEsmond said, "Yes. As far as present favor went, Lady Castlewood was\r\nvery good to him. And should her mind change," he added gaily, "as\r\nladies\' minds will, I am strong enough to bear my own burden, and make\r\nmy way somehow. Not by the sword very likely. Thousands have a better\r\ngenius for that than I, but there are many ways in which a young man of\r\ngood parts and education can get on in the world; and I am pretty sure,\r\none way or other, of promotion!" Indeed, he had found patrons already\r\nin the army, and amongst persons very able to serve him, too; and told\r\nhis mistress of the flattering aspect of fortune. They walked as though\r\nthey had never been parted, slowly, with the grey twilight closing\r\nround them.\r\n\r\n"And now we are drawing near to home," she continued, "I knew you would\r\ncome, Harry, if--if it was but to forgive me for having spoken unjustly\r\nto you after that horrid--horrid misfortune. I was half frantic with\r\ngrief then when I saw you. And I know now--they have told me. That\r\nwretch, whose name I can never mention, even has said it: how you tried\r\nto avert the quarrel, and would have taken it on yourself, my poor\r\nchild: but it was God\'s will that I should be punished, and that my dear\r\nlord should fall."\r\n\r\n"He gave me his blessing on his death-bed," Esmond said. "Thank God for\r\nthat legacy!"\r\n\r\n"Amen, amen! dear Henry," said the lady, pressing his arm. "I knew it.\r\nMr. Atterbury, of St. Bride\'s, who was called to him, told me so. And I\r\nthanked God, too, and in my prayers ever since remembered it."\r\n\r\n"You had spared me many a bitter night, had you told me sooner," Mr.\r\nEsmond said.\r\n\r\n"I know it, I know it," she answered, in a tone of such sweet humility,\r\nas made Esmond repent that he should ever have dared to reproach her. "I\r\nknow how wicked my heart has been; and I have suffered too, my dear.\r\nBut I knew you would come back--I own that. And to-day, Henry, in the\r\nanthem, when they sang it, \'When the Lord turned the captivity of Zion,\r\nwe were like them that dream,\' I thought yes, like them that dream--them\r\nthat dream. And then it went, \'They that sow in tears shall reap in joy;\r\nand he that goeth forth and weepeth, shall doubtless come again with\r\nrejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him;\' I looked up from the book and\r\nsaw you. I was not surprised when I saw you. I knew you would come, my\r\ndear, and saw the gold sunshine round your head."\r\n\r\nShe smiled an almost wild smile as she looked up at him. The moon was up\r\nby this time, glittering keen in the frosty sky. He could see, for the\r\nfirst time now clearly, her sweet careworn face.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what day it is?" she continued. "It is the 29th day of\r\nDecember--it is your birthday! But last year we did not drink it--no,\r\nno. My lord was cold, and my Harry was likely to die: and my brain\r\nwas in a fever; and we had no wine. But now--now you are come again,\r\nbringing your sheaves with you, my dear." She burst into a wild flood\r\nof weeping as she spoke; she laughed and sobbed on the young man\'s\r\nheart, crying out wildly, "bringing your sheaves with you--your sheaves\r\nwith you!"\r\n\r\nAs he had sometimes felt, gazing up from the deck at midnight into the\r\nboundless starlit depths overhead, in a rapture of devout wonder at\r\nthat endless brightness and beauty--in some such a way now, the depth\r\nof this pure devotion quite smote upon him, and filled his heart with\r\nthanksgiving. Gracious God, who was he, weak and friendless creature,\r\nthat such a love should be poured out upon him? Not in vain--not in\r\nvain has he lived--hard and thankless should he be to think so--that\r\nhas such a treasure given him. What is ambition compared to that, but\r\nselfish vanity? To be rich, to be famous? What do these profit a year\r\nhence, when other names sound louder than yours, when you lie hidden\r\naway under the ground, along with idle titles engraven on your coffin?\r\nBut only true love lives after you--follows your memory with secret\r\nblessing--or precedes you, and intercedes for you. _Non omnis\r\nmoriar_--if dying, I yet live in a tender heart or two; nor am lost\r\nand hopeless living, if a sainted departed soul still loves and prays\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[N] _From "The History of Henry Esmond, Esq., a Colonel in the\r\nService of Her Majesty Queen Anne. Written by himself."_\r\n\r\nThe late Lord Castlewood had been killed in a duel, and young Esmond,\r\nwho had lived in his house as a dependant (reputed to have been\r\nillegitimately related to a former Viscount of Castlewood), devotedly\r\nattending him at his death-bed, received from the dying man\r\nconfession and proof that he, the supposed obscure orphan, was the\r\ntrue inheritor, and in justice ought to have been the possessor, of\r\nthe Castlewood titles and estates. But Esmond, for the love he had\r\nborne his patron, and from devotion to Lady Castlewood, who had much\r\nbefriended him, immediately destroyed the proofs which were given him\r\nof his honorable parentage, and ever afterwards kept his claim a\r\nsecret. After the duel, while Esmond was in prison, Lady Castlewood\r\nvisited him, and in the wildness of her grief for her murdered\r\nhusband, reproached her loyal kinsman for not having saved her lord\'s\r\nlife, or avenged his death. In the estrangement which these\r\nreproaches occasioned, Esmond sought his fortune abroad in war; but\r\nsubsequently, desiring to learn of the welfare of his mistress and\r\nher family, whose happiness he prized more than his own, he returned\r\nto England, and went to Winchester, near which was Walcote, Lady\r\nCastlewood\'s home. The family were attending service in the\r\ncathedral, and there the reconciliation took place.--Esmond had\r\nformerly been promised the living of Walcote, but the vacancy\r\noccurring while the estrangement continued. Lady Castlewood had given\r\nit to one Mr. Tusher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIV. THE ISLAND OF THE SCOTS.\r\n\r\n(DECEMBER, 1697.)\r\n\r\nWILLIAM EDMONDSTOUNE AYTOUN.--1813-1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Rhine is running deep and red, the island lies before,--\r\n    "Now is there one of all the host will dare to venture o\'er?\r\n    For not alone the river\'s sweep might make a brave man quail;\r\n    The foe are on the further side, their shot comes fast as hail.\r\n    God help us, if the middle isle we may not hope to win!\r\n    Now is there any of the host will dare to venture in?"\r\n\r\n    "The ford is deep, the banks are steep, the island-shore lies wide;\r\n    Nor man nor horse could stem its force, or reach the further side.\r\n    See there! amidst the willow-boughs the serried bayonets gleam;\r\n    They\'ve flung their bridge,--they\'ve won the isle; the foe have\r\n              cross\'d the stream!\r\n    Their volley flashes sharp and strong,--by all the saints! I trow\r\n    There never yet was soldier born could force that passage now!"\r\n\r\n    So spoke the bold French Mareschal with him who led the van,\r\n    Whilst rough and red before their view the turbid river ran.\r\n    Nor bridge nor boat had they to cross the wild and swollen Rhine,\r\n    And thundering on the other bank far stretch\'d the German line.\r\n    Hard by there stood a swarthy man was leaning on his sword,\r\n    And a sadden\'d smile lit up his face as he heard the Captain\'s word.\r\n    "I\'ve seen a wilder stream ere now than that which rushes there;\r\n    I\'ve stemm\'d a heavier torrent yet and never thought to dare.\r\n    If German steel be sharp and keen, is ours not strong and true?\r\n    There may be danger in the deed, but there is honor too."\r\n\r\n    The old lord in his saddle turn\'d, and hastily he said,\r\n    "Hath bold Duguesclin\'s fiery heart awaken\'d from the dead?\r\n    Thou art the leader of the Scots,--now well and sure I know,\r\n    That gentle blood in dangerous hour ne\'er yet ran cold nor slow,\r\n    And I have seen ye in the fight do all that mortal may:\r\n    If honor is the boon ye seek, it may be won this day,--\r\n    The prize is in the middle isle, there lies the adventurous way,\r\n    And armies twain are on the plain, the daring deed to see,--\r\n    Now ask thy gallant company if they will follow thee!"\r\n\r\n    Right gladsome look\'d the Captain then, and nothing did he say,\r\n    But he turn\'d him to his little band,--O, few, I ween, were they!\r\n    The relics of the bravest force that ever fought in fray.\r\n    No one of all that company but bore a gentle name,\r\n    Not one whose fathers had not stood in Scotland\'s fields of fame.\r\n    All they had march\'d with great Dundee to where he fought and fell,\r\n    And in the deadly battle-strife had venged their leader well:\r\n    And they had bent the knee to earth when every eye was dim,\r\n    As o\'er their hero\'s buried corpse they sang the funeral hymn;\r\n    And they had trod the Pass once more, and stoop\'d on either side\r\n    To pluck the heather from the spot where he had dropp\'d and died;\r\n    And they had bound it next their hearts, and ta\'en a last farewell\r\n    Of Scottish earth and Scottish sky, where Scotland\'s glory fell.\r\n    Then went they forth to foreign lands like bent and broken men,\r\n    Who leave their dearest hope behind, and may not turn again.\r\n\r\n    "The stream," he said, "is broad and deep, and stubborn is\r\n              the foe,--\r\n    Yon island-strength is guarded well,--say, brothers, will ye go?\r\n    From home and kin for many a year our steps have wander\'d wide,\r\n    And never may our bones be laid our fathers\' graves beside.\r\n    No children have we to lament, no wives to wail our fall;\r\n    The traitor\'s and the spoiler\'s hand have reft our hearths of all.\r\n    But we have hearts, and we have arms, as strong to will and dare\r\n    As when our ancient banners flew within the northern air.\r\n    Come, brothers! let me name a spell shall rouse your souls again,\r\n    And send the old blood bounding free through pulse and heart\r\n              and vein.\r\n    Call back the days of bygone years,--be young and strong once more;\r\n    Think yonder stream, so stark and red, is one we\'ve cross\'d before.\r\n    Rise, hill and glen! rise, crag and wood! rise up on either hand,--\r\n    Again upon the Garry\'s banks, on Scottish soil we stand!\r\n    Again I see the tartans wave, again the trumpets ring;\r\n    Again I hear our leader\'s call: \'Upon them for the King!\'\r\n    Stay\'d we behind that glorious day for roaring flood or linn?\r\n    The soul of Gr\xc3\xa6me is with us still,--now, brothers, will ye in?"\r\n\r\n    No stay,--no pause. With one accord, they grasp\'d each other\'s hand,\r\n    Then plunged into the angry flood, that bold and dauntless band.\r\n    High flew the spray above their heads, yet onward still they bore,\r\n    Midst cheer, and shout, and answering yell, and shot, and\r\n              cannon-roar,--\r\n    "Now, by the Holy Cross! I swear, since earth and sea began,\r\n    Was never such a daring deed essay\'d by mortal man!"\r\n\r\n    Thick blew the smoke across the stream, and faster flash\'d the\r\n              flame:\r\n    The water plash\'d in hissing jets as ball and bullet came.\r\n    Yet onwards push\'d the Cavaliers all stern and undismay\'d,\r\n    With thousand arm\xc3\xa8d foes before, and none behind to aid.\r\n    Once, as they near\'d the middle stream, so strong the torrent swept,\r\n    That scarce that long and living wall their dangerous footing kept.\r\n    Then rose a warning cry behind, a joyous shout before:\r\n    "The current\'s strong,--the way is long,--they\'ll never reach the\r\n              shore!\r\n    See, see! they stagger in the midst, they waver in their line!\r\n    Fire on the madmen! break their ranks, and whelm them in the Rhine!"\r\n\r\n    Have you seen the tall trees swaying when the blast is sounding\r\n              shrill,\r\n    And the whirlwind reels in fury down the gorges of the hill?\r\n    How they toss their mighty branches struggling with the tempest\'s\r\n              shock;\r\n    How they keep their place of vantage, cleaving firmly to the rock?\r\n    Even so the Scottish warriors held their own against the river;\r\n    Though the water flash\'d around them, not an eye was seen to quiver;\r\n    Though the shot flew sharp and deadly, not a man relax\'d his hold;\r\n    For their hearts were big and thrilling with the mighty thoughts\r\n              of old.\r\n    One word was spoke among them, and through the ranks it spread,--\r\n    "Remember our dead Claverhouse!" was all the Captain said.\r\n    Then, sternly bending forward, they wrestled on a while,\r\n    Until they clear\'d the heavy stream, then rush\'d towards the isle.\r\n\r\n    The German heart is stout and true, the German arm is strong;\r\n    The German foot goes seldom back where arm\xc3\xa8d foemen throng.\r\n    But never had they faced in field so stern a charge before,\r\n    And never had they felt the sweep of Scotland\'s broad claymore.\r\n    Not fiercer pours the avalanche adown the steep incline,\r\n    That rises o\'er the parent-springs of rough and rapid Rhine,--\r\n    Scarce swifter shoots the bolt from heaven than came the Scottish\r\n              band\r\n    Right up against the guarded trench, and o\'er it sword in hand.\r\n    In vain their leaders forward press,--they meet the deadly brand!\r\n\r\n    O lonely island of the Rhine,--where seed was never sown,\r\n    What harvest lay upon thy sands, by those strong reapers thrown?\r\n    What saw the winter moon that night, as, struggling through the\r\n              rain,\r\n    She pour\'d a wan and fitful light on marsh, and stream, and plain?\r\n    A dreary spot with corpses strewn, and bayonets glistening round;\r\n    A broken bridge, a stranded boat, a bare and batter\'d mound;\r\n    And one huge watch-fire\'s kindled pile, that sent its quivering\r\n              glare\r\n    To tell the leaders of the host the conquering Scots were there!\r\n\r\n    And did they twine the laurel-wreath, for those who fought so well?\r\n    And did they honor those who liv\'d, and weep for those who fell?\r\n    What meed of thanks was given to them let ag\xc3\xa8d annals tell.\r\n    Why should they bring the laurel-wreath,--why crown the cup with\r\n              wine?\r\n    It was not Frenchmen\'s blood that flow\'d so freely on the Rhine,--\r\n    A stranger band of beggar\'d men had done the venturous deed:\r\n    The glory was to France alone, the danger was their meed.\r\n    And what cared they for idle thanks from foreign prince and peer?\r\n    What virtue had such honey\'d words the exiled heart to cheer?\r\n    What matter\'d it that men should vaunt and loud and fondly swear,\r\n    That higher feat of chivalry was never wrought elsewhere?\r\n    They bore within their breasts the grief that fame can never heal,--\r\n    The deep, unutterable woe which none save exiles feel.\r\n    Their hearts were yearning for the land they ne\'er might see\r\n              again,--\r\n    For Scotland\'s high and heather\'d hills, for mountain, loch and\r\n              glen--\r\n    For those who haply lay at rest beyond the distant sea,\r\n    Beneath the green and daisied turf where they would gladly be!\r\n\r\n    Long years went by. The lonely isle in Rhine\'s tempestuous flood\r\n    Has ta\'en another name from those who bought it with their blood:\r\n\r\n    And, though the legend does not live,--for legends lightly die--\r\n    The peasant, as he sees the stream in winter rolling by,\r\n    And foaming o\'er its channel-bed between him and the spot\r\n    Won by the warriors of the sword, stills calls that deep and\r\n              dangerous ford\r\n        The Passage of the Scot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Sacrifice and Self-Devotion hallow earth and fill the skies._\r\n\r\n        LORD HOUGHTON.--1809-1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXV. THE GAMBLING PARTY.\r\n\r\nEARL OF BEACONSFIELD.--1805-1881.\r\n\r\n_From_ THE YOUNG DUKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young Duke had accepted the invitation of the Baron de Berghem for\r\nto-morrow, and accordingly, himself, Lords Castlefort and Dice, and\r\nTemple Grace assembled in Brunswick Terrace at the usual hour. The\r\ndinner was studiously plain, and very little wine was drunk; yet\r\neverything was perfect. Tom Cogit stepped in to carve in his usual\r\nsilent manner. He always came in and went out of a room without anyone\r\nobserving him. He winked familiarly to Temple Grace, but scarcely\r\npresumed to bow to the Duke. He was very busy about the wine, and\r\ndressed the wild fowl in a manner quite unparalleled. He took particular\r\ncare to send a most perfect portion to the young Duke, and he did this,\r\nas he paid all attentions to influential strangers, with the most marked\r\nconsciousness of the sufferance which permitted his presence: never\r\naddressing his Grace, but audibly whispering to the servant, "Take this\r\nto the Duke"; or asking the attendant, "whether his Grace would try the\r\nHermitage?"\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, with the exception of Cogit, who was busied in compounding\r\nsome wonderful liquid for the future refreshment, they sat down to\r\n_\xc3\xa9cart\xc3\xa9_. Without having exchanged a word upon the subject, there seemed\r\na general understanding among all the parties that to-night was to be a\r\npitched battle, and they began at once, briskly. Yet, in spite of their\r\nuniversal determination, midnight arrived without anything decisive.\r\nAnother hour passed over, and then Tom Cogit kept touching the Baron\'s\r\nelbow and whispering in a voice which everybody could understand. All\r\nthis meant that supper was ready. It was brought into the room.\r\n\r\nGaming has one advantage, it gives you an appetite; that is to say, so\r\nlong as you have a chance remaining. The Duke had thousands; for at\r\npresent his resources were unimpared, and he was exhausted by the\r\nconstant attention and anxiety of five hours. He passed over the\r\ndelicacies and went to the side-table, and began cutting himself some\r\ncold roast beef. Tom Cogit ran up, not to his Grace, but to the Baron,\r\nto announce the shocking fact that the Duke of St. James was enduring\r\ngreat trouble; and then the Baron asked his Grace to permit Mr. Cogit to\r\nserve him. Our hero devoured: we use the word advisedly, as fools say in\r\nthe House of Commons: he devoured the roast beef, and rejecting the\r\nHermitage with disgust, asked for porter.\r\n\r\nThey set to again fresh as eagles. At six o\'clock accounts were so\r\ncomplicated that they stopped to make up their books. Each played with\r\nhis memoranda and pencil at his side. Nothing fatal had yet happened.\r\nThe Duke owed Lord Dice about five thousand pounds, and Temple Grace\r\nowed him as many hundreds. Lord Castlefort also was his debtor to the\r\ntune of seven hundred and fifty, and the Baron was in his books, but\r\nslightly. Every half-hour they had a new pack of cards, and threw the\r\nused one on the floor. All this time Tom Cogit did nothing but snuff the\r\ncandles, stir the fire, bring them a new pack, and occasionally make a\r\ntumbler for them. At eight o\'clock the Duke\'s situation was worsened.\r\nThe run was greatly against him, and perhaps his losses were doubled. He\r\npulled up again the next hour or two; but nevertheless, at ten o\'clock,\r\nowed every one something. No one offered to give over; and everyone,\r\nperhaps, felt that his object was not obtained. They made their toilets\r\nand went down-stairs to breakfast. In the meantime the shutters were\r\nopened, the room aired, and in less than an hour they were at it again.\r\n\r\nThey played till dinner-time without intermission; and though the Duke\r\nmade some desperate efforts, and some successful ones, his losses were,\r\nnevertheless, trebled. Yet he ate an excellent dinner and was not at all\r\ndepressed; because the more he lost, the more his courage and his\r\nresources seemed to expand. At first he had limited himself to ten\r\nthousand; after breakfast it was to have been twenty thousand; then\r\nthirty thousand was the ultimatum; and now he dismissed all thoughts of\r\nlimits from his mind, and was determined to risk or gain everything.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, he had lost forty-eight thousand pounds. Affairs now began\r\nto be serious. His supper was not so hearty. While the rest were eating,\r\nhe walked about the room, and began to limit his ambition to recovery,\r\nand not to gain. When you play to win back, the fun is over: there is\r\nnothing to recompense you for your bodily tortures and your degraded\r\nfeelings; and the very best result that can happen, while it has no\r\ncharms, seems to your cowed mind impossible.\r\n\r\nOn they played, and the Duke lost more. His mind was jaded. He\r\nfloundered, he made desperate efforts, but plunged deeper in the\r\nslough. Feeling that, to regain his ground, each card must tell, he\r\nacted on each as if it must win, and the consequences of this\r\ninsanity (for a gamester at such a crisis is really insane) were,\r\nthat his losses were prodigious.\r\n\r\nAnother morning came, and there they sat, ankle-deep in cards. No\r\nattempt at breakfast now, no affectation of making a toilet or airing\r\nthe room. The atmosphere was hot, to be sure, but it well became such\r\na Hell. There they sat, in total, in positive forgetfulness of\r\neverything but the hot game they were hunting down. There was not a\r\nman in the room, except Tom Cogit, who could have told you the name of\r\nthe town in which they were living. There they sat, almost breathless,\r\nwatching every turn with the fell look in their cannibal eyes which\r\nshowed their total inability to sympathize with their fellow-beings.\r\nAll forms of society had been long forgotten. There was no snuff-box\r\nhanded about now, for courtesy, admiration, or a pinch; no affectation\r\nof occasionally making a remark upon any other topic but the\r\nall-engrossing one. Lord Castlefort rested with his arms on the table:\r\na false tooth had got unhinged. His Lordship, who, at any other time,\r\nwould have been most annoyed, coolly put it in his pocket. His cheeks\r\nhad fallen, and he looked twenty years older. Lord Dice had torn off\r\nhis cravat, and his hair hung down over his callous, bloodless cheeks,\r\nstraight as silk. Temple Grace looked as if he were blighted by\r\nlightning; and his deep blue eyes gleamed like a hyena\'s. The Baron\r\nwas least changed. Tom Cogit, who smelt that the crisis was at hand,\r\nwas as quiet as a bribed rat.\r\n\r\nOn they played till six o\'clock in the evening, and then they agreed to\r\ndesist till after dinner. Lord Dice threw himself on a sofa. Lord\r\nCastlefort breathed with difficulty. The rest walked about. While they\r\nwere resting on their oars, the young Duke roughly made up his accounts.\r\nHe found that he was minus about one hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nImmense as this loss was, he was more struck, more appalled, let us\r\nsay, at the strangeness of the surrounding scene, than even by his own\r\nruin. As he looked upon his fellow gamesters, he seemed, for the first\r\ntime in his life, to gaze upon some of those hideous demons of whom he\r\nhad read. He looked in the mirror at himself. A blight seemed to have\r\nfallen over his beauty, and his presence seemed accursed. He had\r\npursued a dissipated, even more than a dissipated career. Many were\r\nthe nights that had been spent by him not on his couch; great had been\r\nthe exhaustion that he had often experienced; haggard had sometimes\r\neven been the lustre of his youth. But when had been marked upon his\r\nbrow this harrowing care? when had his features before been stamped\r\nwith this anxiety, this anguish, this baffled desire, this strange\r\nunearthly scowl, which made him even tremble? What! was it possible?\r\nit could not be, that in time he was to be like those awful, those\r\nunearthly, those unhallowed things that were around him. He felt as if\r\nhe had fallen from his state, as if he had dishonored his ancestry, as\r\nif he had betrayed his trust. He felt a criminal. In the darkness of\r\nhis meditations a flash burst from his lurid mind, a celestial light\r\nappeared to dissipate this thickening gloom, and his soul felt as if\r\nit were bathed with the softening radiancy. He thought of May Dacre,\r\nhe thought of everything that was pure, and holy, and beautiful, and\r\nluminous, and calm. It was the innate virtue of the man that made this\r\nappeal to his corrupted nature. His losses seemed nothing; his dukedom\r\nwould be too slight a ransom for freedom from these ghouls, and for\r\nthe breath of the sweet air.\r\n\r\nHe advanced to the Baron, and expressed his desire to play no more.\r\nThere was an immediate stir. All jumped up, and now the deed was done.\r\nCant, in spite of their exhaustion, assumed her reign. They begged him\r\nto have his revenge, were quite annoyed at the result, had no doubt he\r\nwould recover if he proceeded. Without noticing their remarks, he seated\r\nhimself at the table, and wrote cheques for their respective amounts,\r\nTom Cogit jumping up and bringing him the inkstand. Lord Castlefort, in\r\nthe most affectionate manner, pocketed the draft; at the same time\r\nrecommending the Duke not to be in a hurry, but to send it when he was\r\ncool. Lord Dice received his with a bow, Temple Grace with a sigh, the\r\nBaron with an avowal of his readiness always to give him his revenge.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, though sick at heart, would not leave the room with any\r\nevidence of a broken spirit; and when Lord Castlefort again repeated,\r\n"Pay us when we meet again," he said, "I think it very improbable that\r\nwe shall meet again, my Lord. I wished to know what gaming was. I had\r\nheard a great deal about it. It is not so very disgusting; but I am a\r\nyoung man, and cannot play tricks with my complexion."\r\n\r\nHe reached his house. He gave orders for himself not to be disturbed,\r\nand he went to bed; but in vain he tried to sleep. What rack exceeds the\r\ntorture of an excited brain and an exhausted body? His hands and feet\r\nwere like ice, his brow like fire; his ears rung with supernatural\r\nroaring; a nausea had seized upon him, and death he would have welcomed.\r\nIn vain, in vain he courted repose; in vain, in vain he had recourse to\r\nevery expedient to wile himself to slumber. Each minute he started from\r\nhis pillow with some phrase which reminded him of his late fearful\r\nsociety. Hour after hour moved on with its leaden pace; each hour he\r\nheard strike, and each hour seemed an age. Each hour was only a signal\r\nto cast off some covering, or shift his position. It was, at length,\r\nmorning. With a feeling that he should go mad if he remained any longer\r\nin bed, he rose, and paced his chamber. The air refreshed him. He threw\r\nhimself on the floor; the cold crept over his senses, and he slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVI. THE PICKWICKIANS DISPORT THEMSELVES ON ICE.[O]\r\n\r\nCHARLES DICKENS.--1812-1870.\r\n\r\n_From_ THE POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF THE PICKWICK CLUB.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Now," said Wardle, after a substantial lunch had been done ample\r\njustice to; "what say you to an hour on the ice? We shall have plenty\r\nof time."\r\n\r\n"Capital!" said Mr. Benjamin Allen.\r\n\r\n"Prime!" ejaculated Mr. Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\n"You skate, of course, Winkle?" said Wardle.\r\n\r\n"Ye-yes; oh, yes," replied Mr. Winkle. "I--I--am _rather_ out of\r\npractice."\r\n\r\n"Oh, _do_ skate, Mr. Winkle," said Arabella. "I like to see it so much."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is _so_ graceful," said another young lady.\r\n\r\nA third young lady said it was elegant, and a fourth expressed her\r\nopinion that it was "swan-like."\r\n\r\n"I should be very happy, I\'m sure," said Mr. Winkle, reddening; "but I\r\nhave no skates."\r\n\r\nThis objection was at once over-ruled. Trundle had a couple of pair, and\r\nthe fat boy announced that there were half a dozen more down stairs:\r\nwhereat Mr. Winkle expressed exquisite delight, and looked exquisitely\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\nOld Wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice; and the fat boy\r\nand Mr. Weller, having shovelled and swept away the snow which had\r\nfallen on it during the night, Mr. Bob Sawyer adjusted his skates with a\r\ndexterity which to Mr. Winkle was perfectly marvellous, and described\r\ncircles with his left leg, and cut figures of eight, and inscribed upon\r\nthe ice, without once stopping for breath, a great many other pleasant\r\nand astonishing devices, to the excessive satisfaction of Mr. Pickwick,\r\nMr. Tupman, and the ladies: which reached a pitch of positive\r\nenthusiasm, when old Wardle and Benjamin Allen, assisted by the\r\naforesaid Bob Sawyer, performed some mystic evolutions, which they\r\ncalled a reel.\r\n\r\nAll this time, Mr. Winkle, with his face and hands blue with the cold,\r\nhad been forcing a gimlet into the soles of his feet, and putting his\r\nskates on, with the points behind, and getting the straps into a very\r\ncomplicated and entangled state, with the assistance of Mr. Snodgrass,\r\nwho knew rather less about skates than a Hindoo. At length, however,\r\nwith the assistance of Mr. Weller, the unfortunate skates were firmly\r\nscrewed and buckled on, and Mr. Winkle was raised to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, sir," said Sam, in an encouraging tone; "off vith you, and\r\nshow \'em how to do it."\r\n\r\n"Stop, Sam, stop!" said Mr. Winkle, trembling violently, and clutching\r\nhold of Sam\'s arms with the grasp of a drowning man. "How slippery it\r\nis, Sam!"\r\n\r\n"Not an uncommon thing upon ice, sir," replied Mr. Weller. "Hold up,\r\nsir!"\r\n\r\nThis last observation of Mr. Weller\'s bore reference to a demonstration\r\nMr. Winkle made at the instant, of a frantic desire to throw his feet in\r\nthe air, and dash the back of his head on the ice.\r\n\r\n"These--these--are very awkward skates; ain\'t they, Sam?" inquired Mr.\r\nWinkle, staggering.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afeerd there\'s a orkard gen\'l\'m\'n in \'em, sir," replied Sam.\r\n\r\n"Now, Winkle," cried Mr. Pickwick, quite unconscious that there was\r\nanything the matter. "Come; the ladies are all anxiety."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," replied Mr. Winkle, with a ghastly smile. "I\'m coming."\r\n\r\n"Just a goin\' to begin," said Sam, endeavoring to disengage himself.\r\n"Now, sir, start off!"\r\n\r\n"Stop an instant, Sam," gasped Mr. Winkle, clinging most affectionately\r\nto Mr. Weller. "I find I\'ve got a couple of coats at home that I don\'t\r\nwant, Sam. You may have them, Sam."\r\n\r\n"Thank\'ee, sir," replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n"Never mind touching your hat, Sam," said Mr. Winkle, hastily. "You\r\nneedn\'t take your hand away to do that. I meant to have given you five\r\nshillings this morning for a Christmas-box, Sam. I\'ll give it you this\r\nafternoon, Sam."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wery good, sir," replied Mr. Weller.\r\n\r\n"Just hold me at first, Sam; will you?" said Mr. Winkle. "There--that\'s\r\nright. I shall soon get in the way of it, Sam. Not too fast, Sam; not\r\ntoo fast."\r\n\r\nMr. Winkle stooping forward, with his body half doubled up, was being\r\nassisted over the ice by Mr. Weller, in a very singular and un-swan-like\r\nmanner, when Mr. Pickwick most innocently shouted from the opposite\r\nbank:\r\n\r\n"Sam!"\r\n\r\n"Sir?"\r\n\r\n"Here. I want you."\r\n\r\n"Let go, sir," said Sam. "Don\'t you hear the governor a callin\'? Let\r\ngo, sir."\r\n\r\nWith a violent effort, Mr. Weller disengaged himself from the grasp of\r\nthe agonized Pickwickian, and, in so doing, administered a considerable\r\nimpetus to the unhappy Mr. Winkle. With an accuracy which no degree of\r\ndexterity or practice could have insured, that unfortunate gentleman\r\nbore swiftly down into the centre of the reel, at the very moment when\r\nMr. Bob Sawyer was performing a flourish of unparalleled beauty. Mr.\r\nWinkle struck wildly against him, and with a loud crash they both fell\r\nheavily down. Mr. Pickwick ran to the spot. Bob Sawyer had risen to his\r\nfeet, but Mr. Winkle was far too wise to do anything of the kind, in\r\nskates. He was seated on the ice, making spasmodic efforts to smile;\r\nbut anguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance.\r\n\r\n"Are you hurt?" inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen, with great anxiety.\r\n\r\n"Not much," said Mr. Winkle, rubbing his back very hard.\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d let me bleed you," said Mr. Benjamin, with great\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," replied Mr. Winkle hurriedly.\r\n\r\n"I really think you had better," said Allen.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," replied Mr. Winkle; "I\'d rather not."\r\n\r\n"What do _you_ think, Mr. Pickwick?" inquired Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick was excited and indignant. He beckoned to Mr. Weller, and\r\nsaid in a stern voice, "Take his skates off."\r\n\r\n"No; but really I had scarcely begun," remonstrated Mr. Winkle.\r\n\r\n"Take his skates off," repeated Mr. Pickwick firmly.\r\n\r\nThe command was not to be resisted. Mr. Winkle allowed Sam to obey it in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"Lift him up," said Mr. Pickwick. Sam assisted him to rise.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick retired a few paces apart from the bystanders; and\r\nbeckoning his friend to approach, fixed a searching look upon him,\r\nand uttered in a low, but distinct and emphatic tone, these\r\nremarkable words:\r\n\r\n"You\'re a humbug, sir."\r\n\r\n"A what?" said Mr. Winkle, starting.\r\n\r\n"A humbug, sir. I will speak plainer, if you wish it. An impostor, sir."\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Pickwick turned slowly on his heel, and rejoined\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Pickwick was delivering himself of the sentiment just\r\nrecorded, Mr. Weller and the fat boy, having by their joint endeavors\r\ncut out a slide, were exercising themselves thereupon, in a very\r\nmasterly and brilliant manner. Sam Weller, in particular, was displaying\r\nthat beautiful feat of fancy-sliding which is currently denominated\r\n"knocking at the cobbler\'s door," and which is achieved by skimming over\r\nthe ice on one foot, and occasionally giving a postman\'s knock upon it\r\nwith the other. It was a good long slide, and there was something in the\r\nmotion which Mr. Pickwick, who was very cold with standing still, could\r\nnot help envying.\r\n\r\n"It looks a nice warm exercise that, doesn\'t it?" he inquired of Wardle,\r\nwhen that gentleman was thoroughly out of breath, by reason of the\r\nindefatigable manner in which he had converted his legs into a pair of\r\ncompasses, and drawn complicated problems on the ice.\r\n\r\n"Ah, it does indeed," replied Wardle. "Do you slide?"\r\n\r\n"I used to do so on the gutters, when I was a boy," replied\r\nMr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n"Try it now," said Wardle.\r\n\r\n"Oh do, please, Mr. Pickwick!" cried all the ladies.\r\n\r\n"I should be very happy to afford you any amusement," replied Mr.\r\nPickwick, "but I haven\'t done such a thing these thirty years."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! pooh! Nonsense!" said Wardle, dragging off his skates with the\r\nimpetuosity which characterized all his proceedings. "Here; I\'ll keep\r\nyou company; come along!" And away went the good tempered old fellow\r\ndown the slide, with a rapidity which came very close upon Mr. Weller,\r\nand beat the fat boy all to nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick paused, considered, pulled off his gloves and put them in\r\nhis hat: took two or three short runs, baulked himself as often, and at\r\nlast took another run, and went slowly and gravely down the slide, with\r\nhis feet about a yard and a quarter apart, amidst the gratified shouts\r\nof all the spectators.\r\n\r\n"Keep the pot a bilin\', sir!" said Sam; and down went Wardle again, and\r\nthen Mr. Pickwick, and then Sam, and then Mr. Winkle, and then Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer, and then the fat boy, and then Mr. Snodgrass, following closely\r\nupon each other\'s heels, and running after each other with as much\r\neagerness as if all their future prospects in life depended on their\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nIt was the most intensely interesting thing, to observe the manner in\r\nwhich Mr. Pickwick performed his share in the ceremony; to watch the\r\ntorture of anxiety with which he viewed the person behind, gaining upon\r\nhim at the imminent hazard of tripping him up; to see him gradually\r\nexpend the painful force he had put on at first, and turn slowly round\r\non the slide, with his face towards the point from which he had started;\r\nto contemplate the playful smile which mantled on his face when he had\r\naccomplished the distance, and the eagerness with which he turned round\r\nwhen he had done so, and ran after his predecessor: his black gaiters\r\ntripping pleasantly through the snow, and his eyes beaming cheerfulness\r\nand gladness through his spectacles. And when he was knocked down (which\r\nhappened upon the average every third round), it was the most\r\ninvigorating sight that can possibly be imagined, to behold him gather\r\nup his hat, gloves, and handkerchief, with a glowing countenance, and\r\nresume his station in the rank, with an ardor and enthusiasm that\r\nnothing could abate.\r\n\r\nThe sport was at its height, the sliding was at the quickest, the\r\nlaughter was at the loudest, when a sharp smart crack was heard. There\r\nwas a quick rush towards the bank, a wild scream from the ladies, and a\r\nshout from Mr. Tupman. A large mass of ice disappeared; the water\r\nbubbled up over it; Mr. Pickwick\'s hat, gloves, and handkerchief were\r\nfloating on the surface; and this was all of Mr. Pickwick that anybody\r\ncould see.\r\n\r\nDismay and anguish were depicted on every countenance, the males turned\r\npale, and the females fainted, Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle grasped\r\neach other by the hand, and gazed at the spot where their leader had\r\ngone down, with frenzied eagerness: while Mr. Tupman, by way of\r\nrendering the promptest assistance, and at the same time conveying to\r\nany persons who might be within hearing, the clearest possible notion of\r\nthe catastrophe, ran off across the country at his utmost speed,\r\nscreaming "Fire!" with all his might.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment, when old Wardle and Sam Weller were approaching\r\nthe hole with cautious steps, and Mr. Benjamin Allen was holding a\r\nhurried consultation with Mr. Bob Sawyer on the advisability of bleeding\r\nthe company generally, as an improving little bit of professional\r\npractice--it was at this very moment, that a face, head, and shoulders,\r\nemerged from beneath the water, and disclosed the features and\r\nspectacles of Mr. Pickwick.\r\n\r\n"Keep yourself up for an instant--for only one instant!" bawled Mr.\r\nSnodgrass.\r\n\r\n"Yes, do; let me implore you--for my sake!" roared Mr. Winkle, deeply\r\naffected. The adjuration was rather unnecessary; the probability being,\r\nthat if Mr. Pickwick had declined to keep himself up for anybody else\'s\r\nsake, it would have occurred to him that he might as well do so, for\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n"Do you feel the bottom there, old fellow?" said Wardle.\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly," replied Mr. Pickwick, wringing the water from his head\r\nand face, and gasping for breath. "I fell upon my back. I couldn\'t get\r\non my feet at first."\r\n\r\nThe clay upon so much of Mr. Pickwick\'s coat as was yet visible, bore\r\ntestimony to the accuracy of this statement; and as the fears of the\r\nspectators were still further relieved by the fat boy\'s suddenly\r\nrecollecting that the water was nowhere more than five feet deep,\r\nprodigies of valor were performed to get him out. After a vast quantity\r\nof splashing, and cracking, and struggling, Mr. Pickwick was at length\r\nfairly extricated from his unpleasant position, and once more stood on\r\ndry land.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'ll catch his death of cold," said Emily.\r\n\r\n"Dear old thing!" said Arabella. "Let me wrap this shawl round you,\r\nMr. Pickwick."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s the best thing you can do," said Wardle; "and when you\'ve\r\ngot it on, run home as fast as your legs can carry you, and jump into\r\nbed directly."\r\n\r\nA dozen shawls were offered on the instant. Three or four of the\r\nthickest having been selected, Mr. Pickwick was wrapped up, and\r\nstarted off, under the guidance of Mr. Weller: presenting the\r\nsingular phenomenon of an elderly gentleman, dripping wet, and\r\nwithout a hat, with his arms bound down to his sides, skimming\r\nover the ground, without any clearly defined purpose, at the\r\nrate of six good English miles an hour.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Pickwick cared not for appearances in such an extreme case, and\r\nurged on by Sam Weller, he kept at the very top of his speed until he\r\nreached the door of Manor Farm, where Mr. Tupman had arrived some five\r\nminutes before, and had frightened the old lady into palpitations of the\r\nheart by impressing her with the unalterable conviction that the kitchen\r\nchimney was on fire--a calamity which always presented itself in glowing\r\ncolors to the old lady\'s mind, when anybody about her evinced the\r\nsmallest agitation.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickwick paused not an instant until he was snug in bed. Sam Weller\r\nlighted a blazing fire in his room, and took up his dinner, and\r\nafterwards a great rejoicing was held in honor of his safety.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[O] MR. PICKWICK, a benevolent, simple-minded old gentleman, is the\r\nfounder of the Pickwick Club. He and three other members, Mr. Winkle,\r\nMr. Snodgrass, and Mr. Tupman, form the Corresponding Society of the\r\nclub, and they travel over England together, meeting with many\r\nlaughable adventures. They are accompanied by Samuel Weller, Mr.\r\nPickwick\'s servant, an inimitable compound of cool impudence, quaint\r\nhumor, and fidelity. The Pickwickians have accepted the invitation of\r\nMr. Wardle, of Manor Farm, Dingley Dell, to be present at the\r\nmarriage of his daughter, Isabella, to Mr. Trundle. Among the guests\r\nare also Mr. Bob Sawyer and Mr. Benjamin Allen, two medical students,\r\nand Mr. Allen\'s sister, Arabella. Other members of Mr. Wardle\'s\r\nhousehold are Mr. Wardle\'s mother, the "old lady" of Manor Farm, his\r\ndaughter, Emily, and Joe, a servant lad, known as the "fat boy." The\r\nwedding takes place on the twenty-third of December, and then follow\r\nthe Christmas festivities, of which the skating forms a part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVII. THE HANGING OF THE CRANE.\r\n\r\nHENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW.--1807-1882.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n    The lights are out, and gone are all the guests\r\n    That thronging came with merriment and jests\r\n      To celebrate the Hanging of the Crane\r\n    In the new house,--into the night are gone;\r\n    But still the fire upon the hearth burns on,\r\n        And I alone remain.\r\n\r\n        O fortunate, O happy day,\r\n        When a new household finds its place\r\n        Among the myriad homes of earth,\r\n        Like a new star just sprung to birth,\r\n        And roll\'d on its harmonious way\r\n        Into the boundless realms of space!\r\n        So said the guests in speech and song,\r\n        As in the chimney, burning bright,\r\n        We hung the iron crane to-night,\r\n        And merry was the feast and long.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n    And now I sit and muse on what may be,\r\n    And in my vision see, or seem to see,\r\n      Through floating vapors interfused with light,\r\n    Shapes indeterminate, that gleam and fade,\r\n    As shadows passing into deeper shade\r\n        Sink and elude the sight.\r\n\r\n        For two alone, there in the hall,\r\n        Is spread the table round and small;\r\n        Upon the polish\'d silver shine\r\n        The evening lamps, but, more divine,\r\n        The light of love shines over all;\r\n        Of love, that says not mine and thine,\r\n        But ours, for ours is thine and mine.\r\n\r\n        They want no guests, to come between\r\n        Their tender glances like a screen,\r\n        And tell them tales of land and sea,\r\n        And whatsoever may betide\r\n        The great, forgotten world outside;\r\n        They want no guests; they needs must be\r\n        Each other\'s own best company.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n    The picture fades; as at a village fair\r\n    A showman\'s views, dissolving into air,\r\n      Again appear transfigured on the screen,\r\n    So in my fancy this; and now once more,\r\n    In part transfigured, through the open door\r\n        Appears the selfsame scene.\r\n\r\n        Seated, I see the two again,\r\n        But not alone; they entertain\r\n        A little angel unaware,\r\n        With face as round as is the moon;\r\n        A royal guest with flaxen hair,\r\n        Who, throned upon his lofty chair,\r\n        Drums on the table with his spoon,\r\n        Then drops it careless on the floor,\r\n        To grasp at things unseen before.\r\n\r\n        Are these celestial manners? these\r\n        The ways that win, the arts that please?\r\n        Ah yes; consider well the guest,\r\n        And whatsoe\'er he does seems best;\r\n        He ruleth by the right divine\r\n        Of helplessness, so lately born\r\n        In purple chambers of the morn,\r\n        As sovereign over thee and thine.\r\n        He speaketh not; and yet there lies\r\n        A conversation in his eyes;\r\n        The golden silence of the Greek,\r\n        The gravest wisdom of the wise,\r\n        Not spoken in language, but in looks\r\n        More legible than printed books,\r\n        As if he could but would not speak.\r\n        And now, O monarch absolute,\r\n        Thy power is put to proof; for, lo!\r\n        Resistless, fathomless, and slow,\r\n        The nurse comes rustling like the sea,\r\n        And pushes back thy chair and thee,\r\n        And so good night to King Canute.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n    As one who walking in a forest sees\r\n    A lovely landscape through the parted trees,\r\n      Then sees it not, for boughs that intervene;\r\n    Or, as we see the moon sometimes reveal\'d\r\n    Through drifting clouds, and then again conceal\'d,\r\n        So I behold the scene.\r\n\r\n        There are two guests at table now;\r\n        The king, deposed and older grown,\r\n        No longer occupies the throne,--\r\n        The crown is on his sister\'s brow;\r\n        A Princess from the Fairy Isles,\r\n        The very pattern girl of girls,\r\n        All cover\'d and embower\'d in curls,\r\n        Rose-tinted from the Isle of Flowers,\r\n        And sailing with soft, silken sails\r\n        From far-off Dreamland into ours.\r\n        Above their bowls with rims of blue\r\n        Four azure eyes of deeper hue\r\n        Are looking, dreamy with delight;\r\n        Limpid as planets that emerge\r\n        Above the ocean\'s rounded verge,\r\n        Soft-shining through the summer night.\r\n        Steadfast they gaze, yet nothing see\r\n        Beyond the horizon of their bowls;\r\n        Nor care they for the world that rolls\r\n        With all its freight of troubled souls\r\n        Into the days that are to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n    Again the tossing boughs shut out the scene,\r\n    Again the drifting vapors intervene,\r\n      And the moon\'s pallid disk is hidden quite:\r\n    And now I see the table wider grown,\r\n    As round a pebble into water thrown\r\n        Dilates a ring of light.\r\n\r\n        I see the table wider grown,\r\n        I see it garlanded with guests,\r\n        As if fair Ariadne\'s Crown\r\n        Out of the sky had fallen down;\r\n        Maidens within whose tender breasts\r\n        A thousand restless hopes and fears,\r\n        Forth reaching to the coming years,\r\n        Flutter awhile, then quiet lie,\r\n        Like timid birds that fain would fly,\r\n        But do not dare to leave their nests;--\r\n        And youths, who in their strength elate\r\n        Challenge the van and front of fate,\r\n        Eager as champions to be\r\n        In the divine knight-errantry\r\n        Of youth, that travels sea and land\r\n        Seeking adventures, or pursues,\r\n        Through cities, and through solitudes\r\n        Frequented by the lyric Muse,\r\n        The phantom with the beckoning hand,\r\n        That still allures and still eludes.\r\n        O sweet illusions of the brain!\r\n        O sudden thrills of fire and frost!\r\n        The world is bright while ye remain,\r\n        And dark and dead when ye are lost!\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n    The meadow-brook, that seemeth to stand still,\r\n    Quickens its current as it nears the mill;\r\n      And so the stream of Time that lingereth\r\n    In level places, and so dull appears,\r\n    Runs with a swifter current as it nears\r\n      The gloomy mills of Death.\r\n\r\n        And now, like the magician\'s scroll,\r\n        That in the owner\'s keeping shrinks\r\n        With every wish he speaks or thinks,\r\n        Till the last wish consumes the whole,\r\n        The table dwindles, and again\r\n        I see the two alone remain.\r\n        The crown of stars is broken in parts;\r\n        Its jewels, brighter than the day,\r\n        Have one by one been stolen away\r\n        To shine in other homes and hearts.\r\n        One is a wanderer now afar\r\n        In Ceylon or in Zanzibar,\r\n        Or sunny regions of Cathay;\r\n        And one is in the boisterous camp\r\n        Mid clink of arms and horses\' tramp,\r\n        And battle\'s terrible array.\r\n        I see the patient mother read,\r\n        With aching heart, of wrecks that float\r\n        Disabled on those seas remote,\r\n        Or of some great heroic deed\r\n        On battle-fields, where thousands bleed\r\n        To lift one hero into fame.\r\n        Anxious she bends her graceful head\r\n        Above these chronicles of pain,\r\n        And trembles with a secret dread\r\n        Lest there among the drown\'d or slain\r\n        She find the one belov\xc3\xa8d name.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n    After a day of cloud and wind and rain\r\n    Sometimes the setting sun breaks out again,\r\n      And, touching all the darksome woods with light.\r\n    Smiles on the fields, until they laugh and sing,\r\n    Then like a ruby from the horizon\'s ring\r\n        Drops down into the night.\r\n\r\n        What see I now?

EARTHWORMS.\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN--1809-1882.\r\n\r\n_From_ THE FORMATION OF VEGETABLE MOULD THROUGH THE ACTION OF WORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorms have played a more important part in the history of the world than\r\nmost persons would at first suppose. In almost all humid countries they\r\nare extraordinarily numerous, and for their size possess great muscular\r\npower. In many parts of England a weight of more than ten tons of dry\r\nearth annually passes through their bodies and is brought to the surface\r\non each acre of land; so that the whole superficial bed of vegetable\r\nmould passes through their bodies in the course of every few years. From\r\nthe collapsing of the old burrows the mould is in constant though slow\r\nmovement, and the particles composing it are thus rubbed together. By\r\nthese means fresh surfaces are continually exposed to the action of the\r\ncarbonic acid in the soil, and of the humus-acids which appear to be\r\nstill more efficient in the decomposition of rocks. The generation of\r\nthe humus-acids is probably hastened during the digestion of the many\r\nhalf-decayed leaves which worms consume. Thus the particles of earth,\r\nforming the superficial mould, are subjected to conditions eminently\r\nfavorable for their decomposition and disintegration. Moreover, the\r\nparticles of the softer rocks suffer some amount of mechanical\r\ntrituration in the muscular gizzards of worms, in which small stones\r\nserve as mill-stones....\r\n\r\nArch\xc3\xa6ologists ought to be grateful to worms, as they protect and\r\npreserve for an indefinitely long period every object, not liable to\r\ndecay, which is dropped on the surface of the land, by burying it\r\nbeneath their castings. Thus, also, many elegant and curious tesselated\r\npavements and other ancient remains have been preserved; though no doubt\r\nthe worms have in these cases been largely aided by earth washed and\r\nblown from the adjoining land, especially when cultivated. The old\r\ntesselated pavements have, however, often suffered by having subsided\r\nunequally from being unequally undermined by the worms. Even old massive\r\nwalls may be undermined and subside; and no building is in this respect\r\nsafe, unless the foundations lie six or seven feet beneath the surface,\r\nat a depth at which worms cannot work. It is probable that many\r\nmonoliths and some old walls have fallen down from having been\r\nundermined by worms.\r\n\r\nWorms prepare the ground in an excellent manner for the growth of\r\nfibrous-rooted plants and for seedlings of all kinds. They periodically\r\nexpose the mould to the air, and sift it so that no stones larger than\r\nthe particles which they can swallow are left in it. They mingle the\r\nwhole intimately together, like a gardener who prepares fine soil for\r\nhis choicest plants. In this state it is well fitted to retain moisture\r\nand to absorb all soluble substances, as well as for the process of\r\nnitrification. The bones of dead animals, the harder parts of insects,\r\nthe shells of land-molluscs, leaves, twigs, etc., are before long all\r\nburied beneath the accumulated castings of worms, and are thus brought\r\nin a more or less decayed state within reach of the roots of plants.\r\nWorms likewise drag an infinite number of dead leaves and other parts of\r\nplants into their burrows, partly for the sake of plugging them up and\r\npartly as food.\r\n\r\nThe leaves which are dragged into the burrows as food, after being\r\ntorn into the finest shreds, partially digested, and saturated with\r\nthe intestinal secretions, are commingled with much earth. This\r\nearth forms the dark-colored, rich humus which almost everywhere\r\ncovers the surface of the land with a fairly well-defined layer or\r\nmantle. Von Hensen placed two worms in a vessel eighteen inches in\r\ndiameter, which was filled with sand, on which fallen leaves were\r\nstrewed; and these were soon dragged into their burrows to a depth\r\nof three inches. After about six weeks an almost uniform layer of\r\nsand, a centimetre (.4 inch) in thickness, was converted into humus\r\nby having passed through the alimentary canals of these two worms.\r\nIt is believed by some persons that worm-burrows, which often\r\npenetrate the ground almost perpendicularly to a depth of five or\r\nsix feet, materially aid in its drainage; notwithstanding that the\r\nviscid castings piled over the mouths of the burrows prevent or\r\ncheck the rain-water directly entering them. They allow the air to\r\npenetrate deeply into the ground. They also greatly facilitate the\r\ndownward passage of roots of moderate size; and these will be\r\nnourished by the humus with which the burrows are lined. Many seeds\r\nowe their germination to having been covered by castings; and others\r\nburied to a considerable depth beneath accumulated castings lie\r\ndormant, until at some future time they are accidentally uncovered\r\nand germinate.\r\n\r\nWorms are poorly provided with sense-organs, for they cannot be said to\r\nsee, although they can just distinguish between light and darkness; they\r\nare completely deaf, and have only a feeble power of smell; the sense of\r\ntouch alone is well developed. They can therefore learn little about the\r\noutside world, and it is surprising that they should exhibit some skill\r\nin lining their burrows with their castings and with leaves, and in the\r\ncase of some species in piling up their castings into tower-like\r\nconstructions. But it is far more surprising that they should apparently\r\nexhibit some degree of intelligence instead of a mere blind instinctive\r\nimpulse, in their manner of plugging up the mouths of their burrows.\r\nThey act in nearly the same manner as would a man, who had to close a\r\ncylindrical tube with different kinds of leaves, petioles, triangles of\r\npaper, etc., for they commonly seize such objects by their pointed ends.\r\nBut with thin objects a certain number are drawn in by their broader\r\nends. They do not act in the same unvarying manner in all cases, as do\r\nmost of the lower animals; for instance, they do not drag in leaves by\r\ntheir foot-stalks, unless the basal part of the blade is as narrow as\r\nthe apex, or narrower than it.\r\n\r\nWhen we behold a wide, turf-covered expanse, we should remember that its\r\nsmoothness, on which so much of its beauty depends, is mainly due to all\r\nthe inequalities having been slowly levelled by worms. It is a\r\nmarvellous reflection that the whole of the superficial mould over any\r\nsuch expanse has passed, and will again pass, every few years, through\r\nthe bodies of worms. The plough is one of the most ancient and most\r\nvaluable of man\'s inventions; but long before he existed the land was in\r\nfact regularly ploughed, and still continues to be thus ploughed by\r\nearth-worms. It may be doubted whether there are many other animals\r\nwhich have played so important a part in the history of the world, as\r\nhave these lowly organized creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIX.

DOCTOR ARNOLD AT RUGBY.\r\n\r\nARTHUR PENRHYN STANLEY.--1815-1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith his usual and undoubting confidence in what he believed to be a\r\ngeneral law of Providence, he based his whole management of the school\r\non his early-formed and yearly-increasing conviction that what he had to\r\nlook for, both intellectually and morally, was not performance but\r\npromise; that the very freedom and independence of school life, which in\r\nitself he thought so dangerous, might be made the best preparation for\r\nChristian manhood; and he did not hesitate to apply to his scholars the\r\nprinciple which seemed to him to have been adopted in the training of\r\nthe childhood of the human race itself. He shrunk from pressing on the\r\nconscience of boys rules of action which he felt they were not yet able\r\nto bear, and from enforcing actions which, though right in themselves,\r\nwould in boys be performed from wrong motives. Keenly as he felt the\r\nrisk and fatal consequences of the failure of this trial, still it was\r\nhis great, sometimes his only support to believe that "the character is\r\nbraced amid such scenes to a greater beauty and firmness than it ever\r\ncan attain without enduring and witnessing them. Our work here would be\r\nabsolutely unendurable if we did not bear in mind that we should look\r\nforward as well as backward--if we did not remember that the victory of\r\nfallen man lies not in innocence but in tried virtue." "I hold fast," he\r\nsaid, "to the great truth, that \'blessed is he that overcometh;\'" and he\r\nwrites in 1837: "Of all the painful things connected with my employment,\r\nnothing is equal to the grief of seeing a boy come to school innocent\r\nand promising, and tracing the corruption of his character from the\r\ninfluence of the temptations around him, in the very place which ought\r\nto have strengthened and improved it. But in most cases those who come\r\nwith a character of positive good are benefited; it is the neutral and\r\nindecisive characters which are apt to be decided for evil by schools,\r\nas they would be in fact by any other temptation."\r\n\r\nBut this very feeling led him with the greater eagerness to catch at\r\nevery means by which the trial might be shortened or alleviated. "Can\r\nthe change from childhood to manhood be hastened, without prematurely\r\nexhausting the faculties of body or mind?" was one of the chief\r\nquestions on which his mind was constantly at work, and which in the\r\njudgment of some he was disposed to answer too readily in the\r\naffirmative. It was with the elder boys, of course, that he chiefly\r\nacted on this principle, but with all above the very young ones he\r\ntrusted to it more or less. Firmly as he believed that _a_ time of trial\r\nwas inevitable, he believed no less firmly that it might be passed at\r\npublic schools sooner than under other circumstances; and, in proportion\r\nas he disliked the assumption of a false manliness in boys, was his\r\ndesire to cultivate in them true manliness, as the only step to\r\nsomething higher, and to dwell on earnest principle and moral\r\nthoughtfulness, as the great and distinguishing mark between good and\r\nevil. Hence his wish that as much as possible should be done _by_ the\r\nboys, and nothing _for_ them; hence arose his practice, in which his own\r\ndelicacy of feeling and uprightness of purpose powerfully assisted him,\r\nof treating the boys as gentlemen and reasonable beings, of making them\r\nrespect themselves by the mere respect he showed to them; of showing\r\nthat he appealed and trusted to their own common sense and conscience.\r\nLying, for example, to the masters, he made a great moral offence:\r\nplacing implicit confidence in a boy\'s assertion, and then, if a\r\nfalsehood was discovered, punishing it severely,--in the upper part of\r\nthe school, when persisted in, with expulsion. Even with the lower forms\r\nhe never seemed to be on the watch for boys; and in the higher forms any\r\nattempt at further proof of an assertion was immediately checked: "If\r\nyou say so, that is quite enough--_of course_ I believe your word;" and\r\nthere grew up in consequence a general feeling that "it was a shame to\r\ntell Arnold a lie--he always believes one."\r\n\r\nPerhaps the liveliest representation of this general spirit, as\r\ndistinguished from its exemplification in particular parts of the\r\ndiscipline and instruction, would be formed by recalling his manner, as\r\nhe appeared in the great school, where the boys used to meet when the\r\nwhole school was assembled collectively, and not in its different forms\r\nor classes. Then, whether on his usual entrance every morning to prayers\r\nbefore the first lesson, or on the more special emergencies which might\r\nrequire his presence, he seemed to stand before them, not merely as the\r\nhead-master, but as the representative of the school. There he spoke to\r\nthem as members together with himself of the same great institution,\r\nwhose character and reputation they had to sustain as well as he. He\r\nwould dwell on the satisfaction he had in being head of a society, where\r\nnoble and honorable feelings were encouraged, or on the disgrace which\r\nhe felt in hearing of acts of disorder or violence, such as in the\r\nhumbler ranks of life would render them amenable to the laws of their\r\ncountry; or again, on the trust which he placed in their honor as\r\ngentlemen, and the baseness of any instance in which it was abused. "Is\r\nthis a Christian school?" he indignantly asked at the end of one of\r\nthose addresses, in which he had spoken of an extensive display of bad\r\nfeeling amongst the boys; and then added,--"I cannot remain here if all\r\nthis is to be carried on by constraint and force; if I am to be here as\r\na jailer, I will resign my office at once." And few scenes can be\r\nrecorded more characteristic of him than on one of these occasions,\r\nwhen, in consequence of a disturbance, he had been obliged to send away\r\nseveral boys, and when in the midst of the general spirit of discontent\r\nwhich this excited, he stood in his place before the assembled school\r\nand said: "It is _not_ necessary that this should be a school of three\r\nhundred, or one hundred, or of fifty boys; but it _is_ necessary that it\r\nshould be a school of Christian gentlemen."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIII.

FROM "THE MILL ON THE FLOSS."\r\n\r\nGEORGE ELIOT.--1820-1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning Maggie was trotting with her own fishing-rod in one\r\nhand and a handle of the basket in the other, stepping always, by a\r\npeculiar gift, in the muddiest places, and looking darkly radiant from\r\nunder her beaver bonnet because Tom was good to her. She had told Tom,\r\nhowever, that she should like him to put the worms on the hook for her,\r\nalthough she accepted his word when he assured her that worms couldn\'t\r\nfeel (it was Tom\'s private opinion that it didn\'t much matter if they\r\ndid). He knew all about worms, and fish, and those things; and what\r\nbirds were mischievous, and how padlocks opened, and which way the\r\nhandles of the gates were to be lifted. Maggie thought this sort of\r\nknowledge was very wonderful--much more difficult than remembering what\r\nwas in the books; and she was rather in awe of Tom\'s superiority, for he\r\nwas the only person who called her knowledge "stuff," and did not feel\r\nsurprised at her cleverness. Tom, indeed, was of opinion that Maggie was\r\na silly little thing; all girls were silly; they couldn\'t throw a stone\r\nso as to hit anything, couldn\'t do anything with a pocket-knife, and\r\nwere frightened at frogs. Still, he was very fond of his sister, and\r\nmeant always to take care of her, make her his housekeeper, and punish\r\nher when she did wrong.\r\n\r\nThey were on their way to the Round Pool--that wonderful pool, which\r\nthe floods had made a long while ago. No one knew how deep it was;\r\nand it was mysterious, too, that it should be almost a perfect round,\r\nframed in with willows and tall reeds, so that the water was only to\r\nbe seen when you got close to the brink. The sight of the old favorite\r\nspot always heightened Tom\'s good-humor, and he spoke to Maggie in the\r\nmost amiable whispers, as he opened the precious basket and prepared\r\ntheir tackle. He threw her line for her, and put the rod into her hand.\r\nMaggie thought it probable that the small fish would come to her hook,\r\nand the large ones to Tom\'s. But she had forgotten all about the fish,\r\nand was looking dreamily at the glassy water, when Tom said, in a loud\r\nwhisper, "Look! look, Maggie!" and came running to prevent her from\r\nsnatching her line away.\r\n\r\nMaggie was frightened lest she had been doing something wrong, as usual,\r\nbut presently Tom drew out her line and brought a large tench bouncing\r\non the grass.\r\n\r\nTom was excited.\r\n\r\n"O Magsie! you little duck! Empty the basket."\r\n\r\nMaggie was not conscious of unusual merit, but it was enough that Tom\r\ncalled her Magsie, and was pleased with her. There was nothing to mar\r\nher delight in the whispers and the dreamy silences, when she listened\r\nto the light dipping sounds of the rising fish, and the gentle rustling,\r\nas if the willows, and the reeds, and the water had their happy\r\nwhisperings also. Maggie thought it would make a very nice heaven to sit\r\nby the pool in that way, and never be scolded. She never knew she had a\r\nbite till Tom told her, but she liked fishing very much.\r\n\r\nIt was one of their happy mornings. They trotted along and sat down\r\ntogether, with no thought that life would ever change much for them:\r\nthey would only get bigger and not go to school, and it would always be\r\nlike the holidays; they would always live together and be fond of each\r\nother. And the mill with its booming--the great chestnut-tree under\r\nwhich they played at houses--their own little river, the Ripple, where\r\nthe banks seemed like home, and Tom was always seeing the water-rats,\r\nwhile Maggie gathered the purple plumy tops of the reeds, which she\r\nforgot and dropped afterward--above all, the great Floss, along which\r\nthey wandered with a sense of travel, to see the rushing spring-tide,\r\nthe awful Eagre, come up like a hungry monster, or to see the Great Ash\r\nwhich had once wailed and groaned like a man--these things would always\r\nbe just the same to them. Tom thought people were at a disadvantage who\r\nlived on any other spot of the globe; and Maggie, when she read about\r\nChristiana passing "the river over which there is no bridge," always saw\r\nthe Floss between the green pastures by the Great Ash.\r\n\r\nLife did change for Tom and Maggie; and yet they were not wrong in\r\nbelieving that the thoughts and loves of these first years would always\r\nmake part of their lives. We could never have loved the earth so well if\r\nwe had had no childhood in it--if it were not the earth where the same\r\nflowers come up again every spring that we used to gather with our tiny\r\nfingers as we sat lisping to ourselves on the grass--the same hips and\r\nhaws on the autumn hedgerows--the same red-breasts that we used to call\r\n"God\'s birds," because they did no harm to the precious crops. What\r\nnovelty is worth that sweet monotony where everything is known, and\r\n_loved_ because it is known?\r\n\r\nThe wood I walk in on this mild May day, with the young yellow-brown\r\nfoliage of the oaks between me and the blue sky, the white star-flowers,\r\nand the blue-eyed speedwell, and the ground-ivy at my feet--what grove\r\nof tropic palms, what strange ferns or splendid broad-petaled blossoms,\r\ncould ever thrill such deep and delicate fibres within me as this\r\nhome-scene? These familiar flowers, these well-remembered bird-notes,\r\nthis sky with its fitful brightness, these furrowed and grassy fields,\r\neach with a sort of personality given to it by the capricious\r\nhedgerows--such things as these are the mother tongue of our\r\nimagination, the language that is laden with all the subtle inextricable\r\nassociations the fleeting hours of our childhood left behind them. Our\r\ndelight in the sunshine on the deep-bladed grass to-day might be no more\r\nthan the faint perception of wearied souls, if it were not for the\r\nsunshine and the grass in the far-off years, which still live in us, and\r\ntransform our perception into love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXV.

THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT HON. WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE.--1809-\r\n\r\n_From_ KIN BEYOND SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution has not been the offspring of the thought of man. The\r\nCabinet, and all the present relations of the Constitutional powers in\r\nthis country, have grown into their present dimensions, and settled into\r\ntheir present places, not as the fruit of a philosophy, not in the\r\neffort to give effect to an abstract principle; but by the silent action\r\nof forces, invisible and insensible, the structure has come up into the\r\nview of all the world. It is, perhaps, the most conspicuous object on\r\nthe wide political horizon; but it has thus risen, without noise, like\r\nthe temple of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n    "No workman steel, no ponderous hammers rung;\r\n    Like some tall palm the stately fabric sprung."\r\n\r\nWhen men repeat the proverb which teaches us that "marriages are made in\r\nheaven," what they mean is that, in the most fundamental of all social\r\noperations, the building up of the family, the issues involved in the\r\nnuptial contract, lie beyond the best exercise of human thought, and the\r\nunseen forces of providential government make good the defect in our\r\nimperfect capacity. Even so would it seem to have been in that curious\r\nmarriage of competing influences and powers, which brings about the\r\ncomposite harmony of the British Constitution. More, it must be\r\nadmitted, than any other, it leaves open doors which lead into blind\r\nalleys; for it presumes, more boldly than any other, the good sense and\r\ngood faith of those who work it. If, unhappily, these personages meet\r\ntogether, on the great arena of a nation\'s fortunes, as jockeys meet\r\nupon a racecourse, each to urge to the uttermost, as against the others,\r\nthe power of the animal he rides; or as counsel in a court, each to\r\nprocure the victory of his client, without respect to any other interest\r\nor right: then this boasted Constitution of ours is neither more nor\r\nless than a heap of absurdities. The undoubted competency of each\r\nreaches even to the paralysis or destruction of the rest. The House of\r\nCommons is entitled to refuse every shilling of the Supplies. That\r\nHouse, and also the House of Lords, is entitled to refuse its assent to\r\nevery Bill presented to it. The Crown is entitled to make a thousand\r\nPeers to-day, and as many to-morrow: it may dissolve all and every\r\nParliament before it proceeds to business; may pardon the most atrocious\r\ncrimes; may declare war against all the world; may conclude treaties\r\ninvolving unlimited responsibilities, and even vast expenditure, without\r\nthe consent, nay without the knowledge, of Parliament, and this not\r\nmerely in support or in development, but in reversal, of policy already\r\nknown to and sanctioned by the nation. But the assumption is that the\r\ndepositaries of power will all respect one another; will evince a\r\nconsciousness that they are working in a common interest for a common\r\nend; that they will be possessed, together with not less than an average\r\nintelligence, of not less than an average sense of equity and of the\r\npublic interest and rights. When these reasonable expectations fail,\r\nthen, it must be admitted, the British Constitution will be in danger.\r\n\r\nApart from such contingencies, the offspring only of folly or of crime,\r\nthis Constitution is peculiarly liable to subtle change. Not only in the\r\nlong-run, as man changes between youth and age, but also, like the human\r\nbody, with a quotidian life, a periodical recurrence of ebbing and\r\nflowing tides. Its old particles daily run to waste, and give place to\r\nnew. What is hoped among us is, that which has usually been found, that\r\nevils will become palpable before they have grown to be intolerable....\r\n\r\nMeantime, we of this island are not great political philosophers; and we\r\ncontend with an earnest, but disproportioned, vehemence about changes\r\nwhich are palpable, such as the extension of the suffrage, or the\r\nredistribution of Parliamentary seats, neglecting wholly other processes\r\nof change which work beneath the surface, and in the dark, but which are\r\neven more fertile of great organic results. The modern English character\r\nreflects the English Constitution in this, that it abounds in paradox;\r\nthat it possesses every strength, but holds it tainted with every\r\nweakness; that it seems alternately both to rise above and to fall below\r\nthe standard of average humanity; that there is no allegation of praise\r\nor blame which, in some one of the aspects of its many-sided formation,\r\nit does not deserve; that only in the midst of much default, and much\r\ntransgression, the people of this United Kingdom either have heretofore\r\nestablished, or will hereafter establish, their title to be reckoned\r\namong the children of men, for the eldest born of an imperial race.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _It fortifies my soul to know\r\n    That, though I perish, Truth is so:\r\n    That, howsoe\'er I stray and range,\r\n    Whate\'er I do, Thou dost not change.\r\n    I steadier step when I recall\r\n    That, if I slip Thou dost not fall._\r\n\r\n        ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIX.

THE "REVENGE."\r\n\r\nA BALLAD OF THE FLEET, 1591.\r\n\r\nLORD TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n    At Flores in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay,\r\n    And a pinnace, like a flutter\'d bird, came flying from far away:\r\n    "Spanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted fifty-three!"\r\n    Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: "\'Fore God I am no coward!\r\n    But I cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear,\r\n    And the half my men are sick. I must fly, but follow quick.\r\n    We are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three?"\r\n\r\n    Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: "I know you are no coward;\r\n    You fly them for a moment to fight with them again.\r\n    But I\'ve ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore.\r\n    I should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,\r\n    To these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain."\r\n\r\n    So Lord Howard past away with five ships of war that day,\r\n    Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;\r\n    But Sir Richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land\r\n    Very carefully and slow,\r\n    Men of Bideford in Devon,\r\n    And we laid them on the ballast down below;\r\n    For we brought them all aboard,\r\n    And they blest him in their pain, that they were not left to Spain,\r\n    To the thumbscrew and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.\r\n\r\n    He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,\r\n    And he sail\'d away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,\r\n    With his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow.\r\n    "Shall we fight or shall we fly?\r\n    Good Sir Richard, let us know,\r\n    For to fight is but to die!\r\n    There\'ll be little of us left by the time the sun be set."\r\n    And Sir Richard said again: "We be all good Englishmen.\r\n    Let us bang these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,\r\n    For I never turn\'d my back upon Don or devil yet."\r\n\r\n    Sir Richard spoke, and he laugh\'d, and we roar\'d a hurrah, and so\r\n    The little "Revenge" ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,\r\n    With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;\r\n    For half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,\r\n    And the little "Revenge" ran on thro\' the long sea-lane between.\r\n\r\n    Thousands of their soldiers look\'d down from their decks and\r\n              laugh\'d,\r\n    Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft\r\n    Running on and on, till delay\'d\r\n    By their mountain-like "San Philip" that, of fifteen hundred tons,\r\n    And up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns,\r\n    Took the breath from our sails, and we stay\'d.\r\n\r\n    And while now the great "San Philip" hung above us like a cloud\r\n    Whence the thunderbolt will fall\r\n    Long and loud,\r\n    Four galleons drew away\r\n    From the Spanish fleet that day,\r\n    And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,\r\n    And the battle-thunder broke from them all.\r\n\r\n    But anon the great "San Philip," she bethought herself and went,\r\n    Having that within her womb that had left her ill-content;\r\n    And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,\r\n    For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,\r\n    And a dozen times we shook \'em off as a dog that shakes his ears\r\n    When he leaps from the water to the land.\r\n\r\n    And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer\r\n              sea,\r\n    But never a moment ceas\'d the fight of the one and the fifty-three.\r\n    Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons\r\n              came,\r\n    Ship after ship, the whole night long, with their battle-thunder and\r\n              flame;\r\n    Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and\r\n              her shame;\r\n    For some were sunk and many were shatter\'d, and so could fight us\r\n              no more--\r\n    God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?\r\n    For he said, "Fight on! fight on!"\r\n    Tho\' his vessel was all but a wreck;\r\n    And it chanced that, when half of the summer night was gone,\r\n    With a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck,\r\n    But a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,\r\n    And himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,\r\n    And he said, "Fight on! fight on!"\r\n\r\n    And the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the summer\r\n              sea,\r\n    And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;\r\n    But they dared not touch us again, for they fear\'d that we still\r\n              could sting,\r\n    So they watch\'d what the end would be.\r\n    And we had not fought them in vain,\r\n    But in perilous plight were we,\r\n    Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,\r\n    And half of the rest of us maim\'d for life\r\n    In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;\r\n    And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,\r\n    And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it\r\n              spent;\r\n    And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;\r\n    But Sir Richard cried in his English pride,\r\n    "We have fought such a fight for a day and a night\r\n    As may never be fought again!\r\n    We have won great glory, my men!\r\n    And a day less or more\r\n    At sea or shore,\r\n    We die--does it matter when?\r\n    Sink me the ship, Master Gunner--sink her, split her in twain!\r\n    Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!"\r\n\r\n    And the gunner said, "Ay, ay," but the seamen made reply:\r\n    "We have children, we have wives,\r\n    And the Lord hath spared our lives.\r\n    We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go;\r\n    We shall live to fight again, and to strike another blow."\r\n    And the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe.\r\n\r\n    And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,\r\n    Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,\r\n    And they prais\'d him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;\r\n    But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:\r\n    "I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;\r\n    I have only done my duty as a man is bound to do:\r\n    With a joyful spirit I, Sir Richard Grenville, die!"\r\n    And he fell upon their decks, and he died.\r\n\r\n    And they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true,\r\n    And had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap,\r\n    That he dared her with one little ship and his English few;\r\n    Was he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew,\r\n    But they sank his body with honor down into the deep,\r\n    And they mann\'d the "Revenge" with a swarthier alien crew,\r\n    And away she sail\'d with her loss and long\'d for her own;\r\n    When a wind from the lands they had ruin\'d awoke from sleep,\r\n    And the water began to heave and the weather to moan,\r\n    And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,\r\n    And a wave like the wave that is rais\'d by an earthquake grew,\r\n    Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and their masts and\r\n              their flags,\r\n    And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shatter\'d navy of\r\n              Spain,\r\n    And the little "Revenge" herself went down by the island crags\r\n    To be lost evermore in the main.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _There is no land like England, where\'er the light of day be;\r\n    There are no hearts like English hearts, such hearts of oak as\r\n              they be._\r\n\r\n        TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXII.

FROM THE APOLOGY OF SOCRATES.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN JOWETT.--1817-\r\n\r\n_From_ THE DIALOGUES OF PLATO.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot much time will be gained, O Athenians, in return for the evil name\r\nwhich you will get from the detractors of the city, who will say that\r\nyou killed Socrates, a wise man; for they will call me wise, even\r\nalthough I am not wise, when they want to reproach you. If you had\r\nwaited a little while, your desire would have been fulfilled in the\r\ncourse of nature. For I am far advanced in years, as you may perceive,\r\nand not far from death. I am speaking now only to those of you who have\r\ncondemned me to death. And I have another thing to say to them: You\r\nthink that I was convicted through deficiency of words--I mean, that if\r\nI had thought fit to leave nothing undone, nothing unsaid, I might have\r\ngained an acquittal. Not so; the deficiency which led to my conviction\r\nwas not of words--certainly not. But I had not the boldness or impudence\r\nor inclination to address you as you would have liked me to address you,\r\nweeping and wailing and lamenting, and saying and doing many things\r\nwhich you have been accustomed to hear from others, and which, as I say,\r\nare unworthy of me. But I thought that I ought not to do anything common\r\nor mean in the hour of danger: nor do I now repent of the manner of my\r\ndefense, and I would rather die having spoken after my manner, than\r\nspeak in your manner and live. For neither in war nor yet at law ought\r\nany man to use every way of escaping death. For often in battle there is\r\nno doubt that if a man will throw away his arms, and fall on his knees\r\nbefore his pursuers, he may escape death; and in other dangers there\r\nare other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing to say and do\r\nanything. The difficulty, my friends, is not in avoiding death, but in\r\navoiding unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death. I am old and\r\nmove slowly, and the slower runner has overtaken me, and my accusers are\r\nkeen and quick, and the faster runner, who is unrighteousness, has\r\novertaken them. And now I depart hence, condemned by you to suffer the\r\npenalty of death, and they too go their ways, condemned by the truth to\r\nsuffer the penalty of villainy and wrong; and I must abide by my\r\naward--let them abide by theirs. I suppose that these things may be\r\nregarded as fated,--and I think that they are well.\r\n\r\nAnd now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain prophesy to you; for\r\nI am about to die, and that is the hour in which men are gifted with\r\nprophetic power. And I prophesy to you who are my murderers, that\r\nimmediately after my death punishment far heavier than you have\r\ninflicted on me will surely await you. Me you have killed because you\r\nwanted to escape the accuser, and not to give an account of your lives.\r\nBut that will not be as you suppose: far otherwise. For I say that there\r\nwill be more accusers of you than there are now; accusers whom hitherto\r\nI have restrained: and as they are younger they will be more severe with\r\nyou, and you will be more offended at them. For if you think that by\r\nkilling men you can avoid the accuser censuring your lives, you are\r\nmistaken; that is not a way of escape which is either possible or\r\nhonorable; the easiest and the noblest way is not to be crushing others,\r\nbut to be improving yourselves. This is the prophecy which I utter\r\nbefore my departure to the judges who have condemned me.\r\n\r\nFriends, who would have acquitted me, I would like also to talk with you\r\nabout this thing which has happened, while the magistrates are busy, and\r\nbefore I go to the place at which I must die. Stay then a while, for we\r\nmay as well talk with one another while there is time. You are my\r\nfriends, and I should like to show you the meaning of this event which\r\nhas happened to me. O my judges--for you I may truly call judges--I\r\nshould like to tell you of a wonderful circumstance. Hitherto the\r\nfamiliar oracle within me has constantly been in the habit of opposing\r\nme even about trifles, if I was going to make a slip or error about\r\nanything; and now as you see there has come upon me that which may be\r\nthought, and is generally believed to be, the last and worst evil. But\r\nthe oracle made no sign of opposition, either as I was leaving my house\r\nand going out in the morning, or when I was going up into this court, or\r\nwhile I was speaking, at anything which I was going to say; and yet I\r\nhave often been stopped in the middle of a speech, but now in nothing I\r\neither said or did touching this matter has the oracle opposed me. What\r\ndo I take to be the explanation of this? I will tell you. I regard this\r\nas a proof that what has happened to me is a good, and that those of us\r\nwho think that death is an evil are in error. This is a great proof to\r\nme of what I am saying, for the customary sign would surely have opposed\r\nme had I been going to evil and not to good.\r\n\r\nLet us reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is great\r\nreason to hope that death is a good, for one of two things: either death\r\nis a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say,\r\nthere is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another.\r\nNow if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the\r\nsleep of him who is undisturbed even by the sight of dreams, death will\r\nbe an unspeakable gain. For if a person were to select the night in\r\nwhich his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with\r\nthis the other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how\r\nmany days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and\r\nmore pleasantly than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a\r\nprivate man, but even the great king will not find many such days or\r\nnights, when compared with the others. Now if death is like this, I say\r\nthat to die is gain; for eternity is then only a single night. But if\r\ndeath is the journey to another place, and there, as men say, all the\r\ndead are, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than this?\r\nIf indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the world below, he is delivered\r\nfrom the professors of justice in this world, and finds the true judges\r\nwho are said to give judgment there, Minos and Rhadamanthus, and, \xc3\x86acus,\r\nand Triptolemus, and other sons of God who were righteous in their own\r\nlife, that pilgrimage will be worth making. What would not a man give if\r\nhe might converse with Orpheus and Mus\xc3\xa6us and Hesiod and Homer? Nay, if\r\nthis be true, let me die again and again. I, too, shall have a wonderful\r\ninterest in a place where I can converse with Palamedes, and Ajax the\r\nson of Telamon, and other heroes of old, who have suffered death through\r\nan unjust judgment; and there will be no small pleasure, as I think, in\r\ncomparing my own sufferings with theirs. Above all, I shall be able to\r\ncontinue my search into true and false knowledge; as in this world, so\r\nalso in that; I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise,\r\nand is not. What would not a man give, O judges, to be able to examine\r\nthe leader of the great Trojan expedition; or Odysseus or Sisyphus, or\r\nnumberless others, men and women too? What infinite delight would there\r\nbe in conversing with them and asking them questions! For in that world\r\nthey do not put a man to death for this; certainly not. For besides\r\nbeing happier in that world than in this, they will be immortal, if what\r\nis said is true.\r\n\r\nWherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know this of a\r\ntruth--that no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after\r\ndeath. He and his are not neglected by the gods; nor has my own\r\napproaching end happened by mere chance. But I see clearly that to die\r\nand be released was better for me; and therefore the oracle gave no\r\nsign. For which reason, also, I am not angry with my accusers or my\r\ncondemners; they have done me no harm, although neither of them meant to\r\ndo me any good; and for this I may gently blame them.\r\n\r\nStill I have a favor to ask of them. When my sons are grown up, I would\r\nask you, O my friends, to punish them, and I would have you trouble\r\nthem, as I have troubled you, if they seem to care about riches, or\r\nanything, more than about virtue; or if they pretend to be something\r\nwhen they are really nothing,--then reprove them, as I have reproved\r\nyou, for not caring about that for which they ought to care, and\r\nthinking that they are something when they are really nothing. And if\r\nyou do this, I and my sons will have received justice at your hands.\r\n\r\nThe hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways--I to die, and you\r\nto live. Which is better God only knows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Be of good cheer then, my dear Crito, and say that you\r\n    are burying my body only._\r\n\r\n        _Socrates, in the_ PH\xc3\x86DO.--PLATO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVI. THE EMPIRE OF THE C\xc3\x86SARS.\r\n\r\nJAMES ANTHONY FROUDE.--1818-\r\n\r\n_From_ C\xc3\x86SAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf C\xc3\xa6sar it may be said that he came into the world at a special time\r\nand for a special object. The old religions were dead, from the Pillars\r\nof Hercules to the Euphrates and the Nile, and the principles on which\r\nhuman society had been constructed were dead also. There remained of\r\nspiritual conviction only the common and human sense of justice and\r\nmorality; and out of this sense some ordered system of government had to\r\nbe constructed, under which quiet men could live, and labor, and eat the\r\nfruit of their industry. Under a rule of this material kind there can be\r\nno enthusiasm, no chivalry, no saintly aspirations, no patriotism of the\r\nheroic type. It was not to last forever. A new life was about to dawn\r\nfor mankind. Poetry, and faith, and devotion were to spring again out of\r\nthe seeds which were sleeping in the heart of humanity. But the life\r\nwhich is to endure grows slowly; and as the soil must be prepared before\r\nthe wheat can be sown, so before the Kingdom of Heaven could throw up\r\nits shoots there was needed a kingdom of this world where the nations\r\nwere neither torn in pieces by violence nor were rushing after false\r\nideals and spurious ambitions. Such a kingdom was the Empire of the\r\nC\xc3\xa6sars--a kingdom where peaceful men could work, think, and speak as\r\nthey pleased, and travel freely among provinces ruled for the most part\r\nby Gallios who protected life and property, and forbade fanatics to tear\r\neach other in pieces for their religious opinions. "It is not lawful for\r\nus to put any man to death," was the complaint of the Jewish priests to\r\nthe Roman governor. Had Europe and Asia been covered with independent\r\nnations, each with a local religion represented in its ruling powers,\r\nChristianity must have been stifled in its cradle. If St. Paul had\r\nescaped the Sanhedrim at Jerusalem, he would have been torn to pieces by\r\nthe silversmiths at Ephesus. The appeal to C\xc3\xa6sar\'s judgment-seat was the\r\nshield of his mission, and alone made possible his success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVII. OF THE MYSTERY OF LIFE.\r\n\r\nJOHN RUSKIN--1819-\r\n\r\n_From_ SESAME AND LILIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, returning to the broader question what these arts and labors of\r\nlife have to teach us of its mystery, this is the first of their\r\nlessons--that the more beautiful the art, the more it is essentially the\r\nwork of people who _feel themselves wrong_;--who are striving for the\r\nfulfilment of a law, and the grasp of a loveliness, which they have not\r\nyet attained, which they feel even farther and farther from attaining,\r\nthe more they strive for it. And yet, in still deeper sense, it is the\r\nwork of people who know also that they are right. The very sense of\r\ninevitable error from their purpose marks the perfectness of that\r\npurpose, and the continued sense of failure arises from the continued\r\nopening of the eyes more clearly to all the sacredest laws of truth.\r\n\r\nThis is one lesson. The second is a very plain, and greatly precious\r\none, namely:--that whenever the arts and labors of life are fulfilled\r\nin this spirit of striving against misrule, and doing whatever we have\r\nto do, honorably and perfectly, they invariably bring happiness, as much\r\nas seems possible to the nature of man. In all other paths, by which\r\nthat happiness is pursued, there is disappointment, or destruction: for\r\nambition and for passion there is no rest--no fruition; the fairest\r\npleasures of youth perish in a darkness greater than their past light;\r\nand the loftiest and purest love too often does but inflame the cloud of\r\nlife with endless fire of pain. But, ascending from lowest to highest,\r\nthrough every scale of human industry, that industry worthily followed,\r\ngives peace. Ask the laborer in the field, at the forge, or in the mine;\r\nask the patient, delicate-fingered artisan, or the strong-armed,\r\nfiery-hearted worker in bronze, and in marble, and with the colors of\r\nlight; and none of these, who are true workmen, will ever tell you, that\r\nthey have found the law of heaven an unkind one--that in the sweat of\r\ntheir face they should eat bread, till they return to the ground; nor\r\nthat they ever found it an unrewarded obedience, if, indeed, it was\r\nrendered faithfully to the command--"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to\r\ndo--do it with thy might."\r\n\r\nThese are the two great and constant lessons which our laborers teach us\r\nof the mystery of life. But there is another, and a sadder one, which\r\nthey cannot teach us, which we must read on their tombstones.\r\n\r\n"Do it with thy might." There have been myriads upon myriads of\r\nhuman creatures who have obeyed this law--who have put every breath\r\nand nerve of their being into its toil--who have devoted every hour,\r\nand exhausted every faculty--who have bequeathed their unaccomplished\r\nthoughts at death--who being dead, have yet spoken, by majesty of\r\nmemory, and strength of example. And, at last, what has all this\r\n"Might" of humanity accomplished, in six thousand years of labor and\r\nsorrow? What has it _done_? Take the three chief occupations and arts\r\nof men, one by one, and count their achievements. Begin with the\r\nfirst--the lord of them all--agriculture. Six thousand years have\r\npassed since we were set to till the ground, from which we were\r\ntaken. How much of it is tilled? How much of that which is, wisely or\r\nwell? In the very centre and chief garden of Europe--where the two\r\nforms of parent Christianity have had their fortresses--where the\r\nnoble Catholics of the Forest Cantons, and the noble Protestants of\r\nthe Vaudois valleys, have maintained, for dateless ages, their faiths\r\nand liberties--there the unchecked Alpine rivers yet run wild in\r\ndevastation: and the marshes, which a few hundred men could redeem\r\nwith a year\'s labor, still blast their helpless inhabitants into\r\nfevered idiotism. That is so, in the centre of Europe! While, on the\r\nnear coast of Africa, once the Garden of the Hesperides, an Arab\r\nwoman, but a few sunsets since, ate her child, for famine. And, with\r\nall the treasures of the East at our feet, we, in our own dominion,\r\ncould not find a few grains of rice, for a people that asked of us\r\nno more; but stood by, and saw five hundred thousand of them perish\r\nof hunger.\r\n\r\nThen, after agriculture, the art of kings, take the next head of human\r\narts--weaving; the art of queens, honored of all noble Heathen women, in\r\nthe person of their virgin goddess--honored of all Hebrew women, by the\r\nword of their wisest king--"She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her\r\nhands hold the distaff; she stretcheth out her hand to the poor. She is\r\nnot afraid of the snow for her household, for all her household are\r\nclothed with scarlet. She maketh herself covering of tapestry, her\r\nclothing is silk and purple. She maketh fine linen, and selleth it, and\r\ndelivereth girdles to the merchant." What have we done in all these\r\nthousands of years with this bright art of Greek maid and Christian\r\nmatron? Six thousand years of weaving, and have we learned to weave?\r\nMight not every naked wall have been purple with tapestry, and every\r\nfeeble breast fenced with sweet colors from the cold? What have we done?\r\nOur fingers are too few, it seems, to twist together some poor covering\r\nfor our bodies. We set our streams to work for us, and choke the air\r\nwith fire, to turn our spinning-wheels,--and--_are we yet clothed_? Are\r\nnot the streets of the capitals of Europe foul with the sale of cast\r\nclouts and rotten rags? Is not the beauty of your sweet children left in\r\nwretchedness of disgrace, while, with better honor, nature clothes the\r\nbrood of the bird in its nest, and the suckling of the wolf in her den?\r\nAnd does not every winter\'s snow robe what you have not robed, and\r\nshroud what you have not shrouded; and every winter\'s wind bear up to\r\nheaven its wasted souls, to witness against you hereafter, by the voice\r\nof their Christ,--"I was naked, and ye clothed me not"?\r\n\r\nLastly--take the Art of Building--the strongest-proudest--most\r\norderly--most enduring of the arts of man, that of which the produce is\r\nin the surest manner accumulative, and need not perish, or be replaced;\r\nbut if once well done will stand more strongly than the unbalanced\r\nrocks--more prevalently than the crumbling hills. The art which is\r\nassociated with all civic pride and sacred principle; with which men\r\nrecord their power--satisfy their enthusiasm--make sure their\r\ndefence--define and make dear their habitation. And, in six thousand\r\nyears of building, what have we done? Of the greater part of all that\r\nskill and strength, _no_ vestige is left, but fallen stones, that\r\nencumber the fields and impede the streams. But from this waste of\r\ndisorder, and of time, and of rage, what _is_ left to us? Constructive\r\nand progressive creatures, that we are, with ruling brains, and forming\r\nhands; capable of fellowship, and thirsting for fame, can we not\r\ncontend, in comfort, with the insects of the forest, or, in achievement,\r\nwith the worm of the sea? The white surf rages in vain against the\r\nramparts built by poor atoms of scarcely nascent life; but only ridges\r\nof formless ruin mark the places where once dwelt our noblest\r\nmultitudes. The ant and the moth have cells for each of their young, but\r\nour little ones lie in festering heaps, in homes that consume them like\r\ngraves; and night by night, from the corners of our streets, rises up\r\nthe cry of the homeless--"I was a stranger, and ye took me not in."\r\n\r\nMust it be always thus? Is our life forever to be without\r\nprofit--without possession? Shall the strength of its generations be as\r\nbarren as death; or cast away their labor, as the wild fig-tree casts\r\nher untimely figs? Is it all a dream then--the desire of the eyes and\r\nthe pride of life--or, if it be, might we not live in nobler dream than\r\nthis? The poets and prophets, the wise men, and the scribes, though they\r\nhave told us nothing about a life to come, have told us much about the\r\nlife that is now. They have had--they also,--their dreams, and we have\r\nlaughed at them. They have dreamed of mercy, and of justice; they have\r\ndreamed of peace and good-will; they have dreamed of labor\r\nundisappointed, and of rest undisturbed; they have dreamed of fulness in\r\nharvest, and overflowing in store; they have dreamed of wisdom in\r\ncouncil, and of providence in law; of gladness of parents, and strength\r\nof children, and glory of gray hairs. And at these visions of theirs we\r\nhave mocked, and held them for idle and vain, unreal and\r\nunaccomplishable. What have we accomplished with our realities? Is this\r\nwhat has come of our worldly wisdom, tried against their folly? this our\r\nmightiest possible, against their impotent ideal? or have we only\r\nwandered among the spectra of a baser felicity, and chased phantoms of\r\nthe tombs, instead of visions of the Almighty; and walked after the\r\nimaginations of our evil hearts, instead of after the counsels of\r\nEternity, until our lives--not in the likeness of the cloud of heaven,\r\nbut of the smoke of hell--have become "as a vapor, that appeareth for a\r\nlittle time, and then vanisheth away"?\r\n\r\n_Does_ it vanish then? Are you sure of that?--sure, that the nothingness\r\nof the grave will be a rest from this troubled nothingness; and that the\r\ncoiling shadow, which disquiets itself in vain, cannot change into the\r\nsmoke of the torment that ascends forever? Will any answer that they\r\n_are_ sure of it, and that there is no fear, nor hope, nor desire, nor\r\nlabor, whither they go? Be it so; will you not, then, make as sure of\r\nthe Life, that now is, as you are of the Death that is to come? Your\r\nhearts are wholly in this world--will you not give them to it wisely,\r\nas well as perfectly? And see, first of all, that you _have_ hearts,\r\nand sound hearts, too, to give. Because you have no heaven to look\r\nfor, is that any reason that you should remain ignorant of this\r\nwonderful and infinite earth, which is firmly and instantly given you\r\nin possession? Although your days are numbered, and the following\r\ndarkness sure, is it necessary that you should share the degradation\r\nof the brute, because you are condemned to its mortality; or live the\r\nlife of the moth, and of the worm, because you are to companion them\r\nin the dust? Not so; we may have but a few thousands of days to\r\nspend, perhaps hundreds only--perhaps tens; nay, the longest of our\r\ntime and best, looked back on, will be but as a moment, as the\r\ntwinkling of an eye; still, we are men, not insects; we are living\r\nspirits, not passing clouds. "He maketh the winds His messengers; the\r\nmomentary fire, His minister;" and shall we do less than _these_? Let\r\nus do the work of men while we bear the form of them; and, as we\r\nsnatch our narrow portion of time out of Eternity, snatch also our\r\nnarrow inheritance of passion out of Immortality--even though our\r\nlives _be_ as a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then\r\nvanisheth away.\r\n\r\nBut there are some of you who believe not this--who think this cloud of\r\nlife has no such close--that it is to float, revealed and illumined,\r\nupon the floor of heaven, in the day when He cometh with clouds, and\r\nevery eye shall see Him. Some day, you believe, within these five, or\r\nten, or twenty years, for every one of us the judgment will be set, and\r\nthe books opened. If that be true, far more than that must be true. Is\r\nthere but one day of judgment? Why, for us every day is a day of\r\njudgment--every day is a Dies Ir\xc3\xa6, and writes its irrevocable verdict in\r\nthe flame of its West. Think you that judgment waits till the doors of\r\nthe grave are opened? It waits at the doors of your houses--it waits at\r\nthe corners of your streets; we are in the midst of judgment--the\r\ninsects that we crush are our judges--the moments we fret away are our\r\njudges--the elements that feed us, judge, as they minister--and the\r\npleasures that deceive us, judge as they indulge. Let us, for our lives,\r\ndo the work of Men while we bear the Form of them, if indeed those lives\r\nare _Not_ as a vapor, and do _Not_ vanish away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVIII. THE ROBIN.\r\n\r\nJAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.--1819-\r\n\r\n_From_ MY GARDEN ACQUAINTANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe return of the robin is commonly announced by the newspapers, like\r\nthat of eminent or notorious people to a watering-place, as the first\r\nauthentic notification of spring. And such his appearance in the orchard\r\nand garden undoubtedly is. But, in spite of his name of migratory\r\nthrush, he stays with us all winter, and I have seen him when the\r\nthermometer marked 15 degrees below zero of Fahrenheit, armed\r\nimpregnably within, like Emerson\'s Titmouse, and as cheerful as he. The\r\nrobin has a bad reputation among people who do not value themselves less\r\nfor being fond of cherries. There is, I admit, a spice of vulgarity in\r\nhim, and his song is rather of the Bloomfield sort, too largely\r\nballasted with prose. His ethics are of the Poor Richard school, and the\r\nmain chance which calls forth all his energy is altogether of the belly.\r\nHe never has those fine intervals of lunacy into which his cousins, the\r\ncatbird and the mavis, are apt to fall. But for a\' that and twice as\r\nmuckle \'s a\' that, I would not exchange him for all the cherries that\r\never came out of Asia Minor. With whatever faults, he has not wholly\r\nforfeited that superiority which belongs to the children of nature. He\r\nhas a finer taste in fruit than could be distilled from many successive\r\ncommittees of the Horticultural Society, and he eats with a relishing\r\ngulp not inferior to Dr. Johnson\'s. He feels and freely exercises his\r\nright of eminent domain. His is the earliest mess of green peas; his all\r\nthe mulberries I had fancied mine. But if he get also the lion\'s share\r\nof the raspberries, he is a great planter, and sows those wild ones in\r\nthe woods, that solace the pedestrian and give a momentary calm even to\r\nthe jaded victims of the White Hills. He keeps a strict eye over one\'s\r\nfruit, and knows to a shade of purple when your grapes have cooked long\r\nenough in the sun. During a severe drought a few years ago, the robins\r\nwholly vanished from my garden. I neither saw nor heard one for three\r\nweeks. Meanwhile a small foreign grape-vine, rather shy of bearing,\r\nseemed to find the dusty air congenial, and, dreaming perhaps of its\r\nsweet Argos across the sea, decked itself, with a score or so of fair\r\nbunches. I watched them from day to day till they should have secreted\r\nsugar enough from the sunbeams, and at last made up my mind that I would\r\ncelebrate my vintage the next morning. But the robins too had somehow\r\nkept note of them. They must have sent out spies, as did the Jews into\r\nthe promised land, before I was stirring. When I went with my basket, at\r\nleast a dozen of these winged vintagers bustled out from among the\r\nleaves, and alighting on the nearest trees interchanged some shrill\r\nremarks about me of a derogatory nature. They had fairly sacked the\r\nvine. Not Wellington\'s veterans made cleaner work of a Spanish town; not\r\nFederals or Confederates were ever more impartial in the confiscation of\r\nneutral chickens. I was keeping my grapes a secret to surprise the fair\r\nFidele with, but the robins made them a profounder secret to her than I\r\nhad meant. The tattered remnant of a single bunch was all my\r\nharvest-home. How paltry it looked at the bottom of my basket,--as if a\r\nhumming-bird had laid her egg in an eagle\'s nest! I could not help\r\nlaughing; and the robins seemed to join heartily in the merriment. There\r\nwas a native grape-vine close by, blue with its less refined abundance,\r\nbut my cunning thieves preferred the foreign flavor. Could I tax them\r\nwith want of taste?\r\n\r\nThe robins are not good solo singers, but their chorus, as, like\r\nprimitive fire-worshippers, they hail the return of light and warmth\r\nto the world, is unrivalled. There are a hundred singing like one.\r\nThey are noisy enough then, and sing, as poets should, with no\r\nafterthought. But when they come after cherries to the tree near my\r\nwindow, they muffle their voices, and their faint _pip, pip, pop_!\r\nsounds far away at the bottom of the garden, where they know I shall\r\nnot suspect them of robbing the great black-walnut of its\r\nbitter-rinded store.[P] They are feathered Pecksniffs, to be sure,\r\nbut then how brightly their breasts, that look rather shabby in the\r\nsunlight, shine in a rainy day against the dark green of the\r\nfringe-tree! After they have pinched and shaken all the life out of\r\nan earthworm, as Italian cooks pound all the spirit out of a steak,\r\nand then gulped him, they stand up in honest self-confidence, expand\r\ntheir red waistcoats with the virtuous air of a lobby member, and\r\noutface you with an eye that calmly challenges inquiry. "Do _I_ look\r\nlike a bird that knows the flavor of raw vermin? I throw myself upon\r\na jury of my peers. Ask any robin if he ever ate anything less\r\nascetic than the frugal berry of the juniper, and he will answer that\r\nhis vow forbids him." Can such an open bosom cover such depravity?\r\nAlas, yes! I have no doubt his breast was redder at that very moment\r\nwith the blood of my raspberries. On the whole, he is a doubtful\r\nfriend in the garden. He makes his dessert of all kinds of berries,\r\nand is not averse from early pears. But when we remember how\r\nomnivorous he is, eating his own weight in an incredibly short time,\r\nand that Nature seems exhaustless in her invention of new insects\r\nhostile to vegetation, perhaps we may reckon that he does more good\r\nthan harm. For my own part, I would rather have his cheerfulness and\r\nkind neighborhood than many berries.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[P] The screech-owl, whose cry, despite his ill name, is one of the\r\nsweetest sounds in nature, softens his voice in the same way with the\r\nmost beguiling mockery of distance.--AUTHOR\'S NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIX.

RUGBY CHAPEL.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER, 1857.\r\n\r\nMATTHEW ARNOLD.--1822-\r\n\r\n\r\n    Coldly, sadly descends\r\n    The autumn-evening. The field\r\n    Strewn with its dank yellow drifts\r\n    Of wither\'d leaves, and the elms,\r\n    Fade into dimness apace,\r\n    Silent;--hardly a shout\r\n    From a few boys late at their play!\r\n    The lights come out in the street,\r\n    In the school-room windows--but cold,\r\n    Solemn, unlighted, austere,\r\n    Through the gathering darkness, arise\r\n    The chapel-walls, in whose bound\r\n    Thou, my father! art laid.\r\n\r\n    There thou dost lie, in the gloom\r\n    Of the autumn evening. But ah!\r\n    That word, _gloom_, to my mind\r\n    Brings thee back in the light\r\n    Of thy radiant vigor again:\r\n    In the gloom of November we pass\'d\r\n    Days not dark at thy side;\r\n    Seasons impair\'d not the ray\r\n    Of thy buoyant cheerfulness clear.\r\n    Such thou wast! and I stand\r\n    In the autumn evening, and think\r\n    Of bygone autumns with thee.\r\n\r\n    Fifteen years have gone round\r\n    Since thou arosest to tread,\r\n    In the summer-morning, the road\r\n    Of death, at a call unforeseen,\r\n    Sudden. For fifteen years,\r\n    We who till then in thy shade\r\n    Rested as under the boughs\r\n    Of a mighty oak, have endured\r\n    Sunshine and rain as we might,\r\n    Bare, unshaded, alone,\r\n    Lacking the shelter of thee.\r\n\r\n    O strong soul, by what shore\r\n    Tarriest thou now? For that force,\r\n    Surely, has not been left vain!\r\n    Somewhere, surely, afar,\r\n    In the sounding labor-house vast\r\n    Of being, is practis\'d that strength,\r\n    Zealous, beneficent, firm!\r\n    Yes, in some far-shining sphere,\r\n    Conscious or not of the past,\r\n    Still thou performest the word\r\n    Of the Spirit in whom thou dost live--\r\n    Prompt, unwearied, as here!\r\n    Still thou upraisest with zeal\r\n    The humble good from the ground,\r\n    Sternly repressest the bad!\r\n    Still, like a trumpet, dost rouse\r\n    Those who with half-open eyes\r\n    Tread the border-land dim\r\n    \'Twixt vice and virtue; reviv\'st,\r\n    Succorest!--this was thy work.\r\n    This was thy life upon earth.\r\n\r\n    What is the course of the life\r\n    Of mortal men on the earth?--\r\n    Most men eddy about\r\n    Here and there--eat and drink,\r\n    Chatter and love and hate,\r\n    Gather and squander, are rais\'d\r\n    Aloft, are hurl\'d in the dust,\r\n    Striving blindly, achieving\r\n    Nothing; and then they die--\r\n    Perish--and no one asks\r\n    Who or what they have been,\r\n    More than he asks what waves,\r\n    In the moonlit solitudes mild\r\n    Of the midmost Ocean, have swell\'d,\r\n    Foam\'d for a moment, and gone.\r\n\r\n    And there are some, whom a thirst\r\n    Ardent, unquenchable, fires,\r\n    Not with the crowd to be spent,\r\n    Not without aim to go round\r\n    In an eddy of purposeless dust\r\n    Effort unmeaning and vain.\r\n    Ah yes! some of us strive\r\n    Not without action to die\r\n    Fruitless, but something to snatch\r\n    From dull oblivion, nor all\r\n    Glut the devouring grave!\r\n    We, we have chosen our path--\r\n    Path to a clear-purpos\'d goal,\r\n    Path of advance!--but it leads\r\n    A long, steep journey, through sunk\r\n    Gorges, o\'er mountains in snow.\r\n    Cheerful, with friends, we set forth--\r\n    Then, on the height, comes the storm.\r\n    Thunder crashes from rock\r\n    To rock, the cataracts reply;\r\n    Lightnings dazzle our eyes;\r\n    Roaring torrents have breach\'d\r\n    The track, the stream-bed descends\r\n    In the place where the wayfarer once\r\n    Planted his footstep--the spray\r\n    Boils o\'er its borders! aloft\r\n    The unseen snow-beds dislodge\r\n    Their hanging ruin!--alas,\r\n    Havoc is made in our train!\r\n    Friends, who set forth at our side,\r\n    Falter, are lost in the storm.\r\n    We, we only are left!--\r\n    With frowning foreheads, with lips\r\n    Sternly compress\'d, we strain on\r\n    On--and at nightfall at last\r\n    Come to the end of our way,\r\n    To the lonely inn \'mid the rocks;\r\n    Where the gaunt and taciturn host\r\n    Stands on the threshold, the wind\r\n    Shaking his thin white hairs--\r\n    Holds his lantern to scan\r\n    Our storm-beat figures, and asks:\r\n    Whom in our party we bring?\r\n    Whom we have left in the snow?\r\n\r\n    Sadly we answer: We bring\r\n    Only ourselves! we lost\r\n    Sight of the rest in the storm.\r\n    Hardly ourselves we fought through,\r\n    Stripp\'d, without friends, as we are.\r\n    Friends, companions, and train,\r\n    The avalanche swept from our side.\r\n\r\n    But thou would\'st not _alone_\r\n    Be saved, my father! _alone_\r\n    Conquer and come to thy goal,\r\n    Leaving the rest in the wild.\r\n    We were weary; and we\r\n    Fearful, and we in our march\r\n    Fain to drop down and to die.\r\n    Still thou turnedst, and still\r\n    Beckonedst the trembler, and still\r\n    Gavest the weary thy hand.\r\n    If, in the paths of the world,\r\n    Stones might have wounded thy feet,\r\n    Toil or dejection have tried\r\n    Thy spirit, of that we saw\r\n    Nothing--to us thou wast still\r\n    Cheerful, and helpful, and firm!\r\n    Therefore to thee it was given\r\n    Many to save with thyself;\r\n    And, at the end of thy day,\r\n    O faithful shepherd! to come,\r\n    Bringing thy sheep in thy hand,\r\n    And through thee I believe\r\n    In the noble and great who are gone;\r\n    Pure souls honor\'d and blest\r\n    By former ages, who else--\r\n    Such, so soulless, so poor,\r\n    Is the race of men whom I see--\r\n    Seem\'d but a dream of the heart,\r\n    Seem\'d but a cry of desire.\r\n    Yes! I believe that there liv\'d\r\n    Others like thee in the past,\r\n    Not like the men of the crowd\r\n    Who all round me to-day\r\n    Bluster or cringe, and make life\r\n    Hideous, and arid, and vile;\r\n    But souls temper\'d with fire,\r\n    Fervent, heroic, and good,\r\n    Helpers and friends of mankind.\r\n\r\n    Servants of God!--or sons\r\n    Shall I not call you? because\r\n    Not as servants ye knew\r\n    Your Father\'s innermost mind,\r\n    His, who unwillingly sees\r\n    One of his little ones lost--\r\n    Yours is the praise, if mankind\r\n    Hath not as yet in its march\r\n    Fainted, and fallen, and died!\r\n\r\n    See! In the rocks of the world\r\n    Marches the host of mankind,\r\n    A feeble, wavering line.\r\n    Where are they tending?--A God\r\n    Marshall\'d them, gave them their goal.--\r\n    Ah, but the way is so long!\r\n\r\n    Years they have been in the wild!\r\n    Sore thirst plagues them, the rocks,\r\n    Rising all round, overawe;\r\n    Factions divide them, their host\r\n    Threatens to break, to dissolve.--\r\n    Ah, keep, keep them combined!\r\n    Else, of the myriads who fill\r\n    That army, not one shall arrive;\r\n    Sole they shall stray; on the rocks\r\n    Batter forever in vain,\r\n    Die one by one in the waste.\r\n\r\n    Then, in such hour of need\r\n    Of your fainting, dispirited race,\r\n    Ye, like angels, appear,\r\n    Radiant with ardor divine.\r\n    Beacons of hope, ye appear!\r\n    Languor is not in your heart,\r\n    Weakness is not in your word,\r\n    Weariness not on your brow.\r\n    Ye alight in our van! at your voice,\r\n    Panic, despair, flee away.\r\n    Ye move through the ranks, recall\r\n    The stragglers, refresh the outworn,\r\n    Praise, re-inspire the brave.\r\n    Order, courage, return;\r\n    Eyes rekindling, and prayers,\r\n    Follow your steps as ye go.\r\n    Ye fill up the gaps in our files,\r\n    Strengthen the wavering line,\r\n    Stablish, continue our march,\r\n    On, to the bound of the waste,\r\n    On, to the City of God.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _What know we greater than the soul?\r\n    On God and Godlike men we build our trust._\r\n\r\n        TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCI.

MORALS AND CHARACTER IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nGOLDWIN SMITH.--1823-\r\n\r\n_From_ COWPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world into which Cowper came was one very adverse to him, and at the\r\nsame time very much in need of him. It was a world from which the spirit\r\nof poetry seemed to have fled. There could be no stronger proof of this\r\nthan the occupation of the throne of Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton,\r\nby the arch-versifier Pope. The Revolution of 1688 was glorious, but\r\nunlike the Puritan Revolution which it followed, and in the political\r\nsphere partly ratified, it was profoundly prosaic. Spiritual religion,\r\nthe source of Puritan grandeur and of the poetry of Milton, was almost\r\nextinct; there was not much more of it among the Nonconformists, who had\r\nnow become to a great extent mere Whigs, with a decided Unitarian\r\ntendency. The Church was little better than a political force cultivated\r\nand manipulated by political leaders for their own purposes. The Bishops\r\nwere either politicians, or theological polemics collecting trophies of\r\nvictory over free-thinkers as titles to higher preferment. The inferior\r\nclergy as a body were far nearer in character to Trulliber than to Dr.\r\nPrimrose; coarse, sordid, neglectful of their duties, shamelessly\r\naddicted to sinecurism and pluralities, fanatics in their Toryism and in\r\nattachment to their corporate privileges, cold, rationalistic, and\r\nalmost heathen in their preachings, if they preached at all. The society\r\nof the day is mirrored in the pictures of Hogarth in the works of\r\nFielding and Smollett; hard and heartless polish was the best of it; and\r\nnot a little of it was _Marriage \xc3\xa0 la Mode_. Chesterfield, with his\r\nsoulless culture, his court graces, and his fashionable immoralities,\r\nwas about the highest type of an English gentleman; but the Wilkeses,\r\nPotters, and Sandwiches, whose mania for vice culminated in the\r\nHell-fire Club, were more numerous than the Chesterfields. Among the\r\ncountry squires, for one Allworthy, or Sir Roger de Coverley, there were\r\nmany Westerns. Among the common people religion was almost extinct, and\r\nassuredly no new morality or sentiment, such as Positivists now promise,\r\nhad taken its place. Sometimes the rustic thought for himself, and\r\nscepticism took formal possession of his mind; but as we see from one of\r\nCowper\'s letters, it was a coarse scepticism which desired to be buried\r\nwith its hounds. Ignorance and brutality reigned in the cottage.\r\nDrunkenness reigned in palace and cottage alike. Gambling,\r\ncock-fighting, and bull-fighting were the amusements of the people.\r\nPolitical life, which, if it had been pure and vigorous, might have made\r\nup for the absence of spiritual influences, was corrupt from the top of\r\nthe scale to the bottom: its effect on national character is portrayed\r\nin Hogarth\'s _Election_. That property had its duties as well as its\r\nrights, nobody had yet ventured to say or think. The duty of a gentleman\r\ntowards his own class was to pay his debts of honor, and to fight a duel\r\nwhenever he was challenged by one of his own order; towards the lower\r\nclass his duty was none. Though the forms of government were elective,\r\nand Cowper gives us a description of the candidate at election time\r\nobsequiously soliciting votes, society was intensely aristocratic, and\r\neach rank was divided from that below it by a sharp line which precluded\r\nbrotherhood or sympathy. Says the Duchess of Buckingham to Lady\r\nHuntingdon, who had asked her to come and hear Whitefield, "I thank\r\nyour ladyship for the information concerning the Methodist preachers;\r\ntheir doctrines are most repulsive, and strongly tinctured with\r\ndisrespect towards their superiors, in perpetually endeavoring to level\r\nall ranks and do away with all distinctions. It is monstrous to be told\r\nyou have a heart as sinful as the common wretches that crawl on the\r\nearth. This is highly offensive and insulting; and I cannot but wonder\r\nthat your ladyship should relish any sentiments so much at variance with\r\nhigh rank and good breeding. I shall be most happy to come and hear your\r\nfavorite preacher." Her Grace\'s sentiments towards the common wretches\r\nthat crawl on the earth were shared, we may be sure, by her Grace\'s\r\nwaiting-maid. Of humanity there was as little as there was of religion.\r\nIt was the age of the criminal law which hanged men for petty thefts, of\r\nlife-long imprisonment for debt, of the stocks and the pillory, of a\r\nTemple Bar garnished with the heads of traitors, of the unreformed\r\nprison system, of the press-gang, of unrestrained tyranny and savagery\r\nat public schools. That the slave trade was iniquitous hardly any one\r\nsuspected; even men who deemed themselves religious took part in it\r\nwithout scruple. But a change was at hand, and a still mightier change\r\nwas in prospect. At the time of Cowper\'s birth, John Wesley was\r\ntwenty-eight, and Whitefield was seventeen. With them the revival of\r\nreligion, was at hand. Johnson, the moral reformer, was twenty-two.\r\nHoward was born, and in less than a generation Wilberforce was to come.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    _That is best blood that hath most iron in \'t\r\n    To edge resolve with, pouring without stint\r\n      For what makes manhood dear._\r\n\r\n        JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIII. A LIBERAL EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HENRY HUXLEY.--1825-\r\n\r\n_From_ LAY SERMONS, ADDRESSES, AND REVIEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppose it were perfectly certain that the life and fortune of every one\r\nof us would, one day or other, depend upon his winning or losing a game\r\nat chess. Don\'t you think that we should all consider it to be a primary\r\nduty to learn at least the names and the moves of the pieces; to have a\r\nnotion of a gambit, and a keen eye for all the means of giving and\r\ngetting out of check? Do you not think that we should look with a\r\ndisapprobation amounting to scorn, upon the father who allowed his son,\r\nor the state which allowed its members, to grow up without knowing a\r\npawn from a knight?\r\n\r\nYet it is a very plain and elementary truth, that the life, the\r\nfortune, and the happiness of every one of us, and, more or less,\r\nof those who are connected with us, do depend upon our knowing\r\nsomething of the rules of a game infinitely more difficult and\r\ncomplicated than chess. It is a game which has been played for\r\nuntold ages, every man and woman of us being one of the two players\r\nin a game of his or her own. The chess-board is the world, the\r\npieces are the phenomena of the universe, the rules of the game are\r\nwhat we call the laws of Nature. The player on the other side is\r\nhidden from us. We know that his play is always fair, just, and\r\npatient. But also we know, to our cost, that he never overlooks a\r\nmistake, or makes the smallest allowance for ignorance. To the man\r\nwho plays well, the highest stakes are paid, with that sort of\r\noverflowing generosity with which the strong shows delight in\r\nstrength. And one who plays ill is checkmated--without haste, but\r\nwithout remorse.\r\n\r\nMy metaphor will remind some of you of the famous picture in which\r\nRetzsch has depicted Satan playing at chess with man for his soul.\r\nSubstitute for the mocking fiend in that picture, a calm, strong angel,\r\nwho is playing for love, as we say, and would rather lose than win--and\r\nI should accept it as an image of human life.\r\n\r\nWell, what I mean by Education, is learning the rules of this mighty\r\ngame. In other words, education is the instruction of the intellect in\r\nthe laws of Nature, under which name I include not merely things and\r\ntheir forces, but men and their ways; and the fashioning of the\r\naffections and of the will into an earnest and loving desire to move in\r\nharmony with those laws. For me, education means neither more nor less\r\nthan this. Anything which professes to call itself education must be\r\ntried by this standard, and if it fails to stand the test, I will not\r\ncall it education, whatever may be the force of authority, or of\r\nnumbers, upon the other side.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that, in strictness, there is no such thing\r\nas an uneducated man. Take an extreme case. Suppose that an adult man,\r\nin the full vigor of his faculties, could be suddenly placed in the\r\nworld, as Adam is said to have been, and then left to do as he best\r\nmight. How long would he be left uneducated? Not five minutes. Nature\r\nwould begin to teach him, through the eye, the ear, the touch, the\r\nproperties of objects. Pain and pleasure would be at his elbow telling\r\nhim to do this and avoid that; and by slow degrees the man would receive\r\nan education, which, if narrow, would be thorough, real, and adequate to\r\nhis circumstances, though there would be no extras and very few\r\naccomplishments.\r\n\r\nAnd if to this solitary man entered a second Adam, or, better still, an\r\nEve, a new and greater world, that of social and moral phenomena, would\r\nbe revealed. Joys and woes, compared with which all others might seem\r\nbut faint shadows, would spring from the new relations. Happiness and\r\nsorrow would take the place of the coarser monitors, pleasure and pain;\r\nbut conduct would still be shaped by the observation of the natural\r\nconsequences of actions; or, in other words, by the laws of the nature\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nTo every one of us the world was once as fresh and new as to Adam. And\r\nthen, long before we were susceptible of any other mode of instruction,\r\nNature took us in hand, and every minute of waking life brought its\r\neducational influence, shaping our actions into rough accordance with\r\nNature\'s laws, so that we might not be ended untimely by too gross\r\ndisobedience. Nor should I speak of this process of education as past\r\nfor any one, be he as old as he may. For every man, the world is as\r\nfresh as it was at the first day, and as full of untold novelties for\r\nhim who has the eyes to see them. And Nature is still continuing her\r\npatient education of us in that great university, the universe, of which\r\nwe are all members--Nature having no Test-Acts.\r\n\r\nThose who take honors in Nature\'s university, who learn the laws which\r\ngovern men and things, and obey them, are the really great and\r\nsuccessful men in this world. The great mass of mankind are the "Poll,"\r\nwho pick up just enough to get through without much discredit. Those who\r\nwon\'t learn at all are plucked; and then you can\'t come up again.\r\nNature\'s pluck means extermination.\r\n\r\nThus the question of compulsory education is settled so far as Nature is\r\nconcerned. Her bill on that question was framed and passed long ago.\r\nBut, like all compulsory legislation, that of Nature is harsh and\r\nwasteful in its operation. Ignorance is visited as sharply as wilful\r\ndisobedience--incapacity meets with the same punishment as crime.\r\nNature\'s discipline is not even a word and a blow, and the blow first;\r\nbut the blow without the word. It is left to you to find out why your\r\nears are boxed.\r\n\r\nThe object of what we commonly call education--that education in which\r\nman intervenes and which I shall distinguish as artificial education--is\r\nto make good these defects in Nature\'s methods; to prepare the child to\r\nreceive Nature\'s education, neither incapably nor ignorantly, nor with\r\nwilful disobedience; and to understand the preliminary symptoms of her\r\ndispleasure, without waiting for the box on the ear. In short, all\r\nartificial education ought to be an anticipation of natural education.\r\nAnd a liberal education is an artificial education, which has not only\r\nprepared a man to escape the great evils of disobedience to natural\r\nlaws, but has trained him to appreciate and to seize upon the rewards\r\nwhich Nature scatters with as free a hand as her penalties.\r\n\r\nThat man, I think, has had a liberal education, who has been so trained\r\nin youth that his body is the ready servant of his will, and does with\r\nease and pleasure all the work that, as a mechanism, it is capable of;\r\nwhose intellect is a clear, cold, logic engine, with all its parts of\r\nequal strength, and in smooth working order; ready, like a steam engine,\r\nto be turned to any kind of work, and spin the gossamers as well as\r\nforge the anchors of the mind; whose mind is stored with a knowledge of\r\nthe great and fundamental truths of Nature and of the laws of her\r\noperations; one, who, no stunted ascetic, is full of life and fire, but\r\nwhose passions are trained to come to heel by a vigorous will, the\r\nservant of a tender conscience; who has learned to love all beauty,\r\nwhether of Nature or of art, to hate all vileness, and to respect others\r\nas himself.\r\n\r\nSuch an one and no other, I conceive, has had a liberal education; for\r\nhe is, as completely as a man can be, in harmony with Nature. He will\r\nmake the best of her, and she of him. They will get on together rarely;\r\nshe as his ever beneficent mother; he as her mouth-piece, her conscious\r\nself, her minister and interpreter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIV.

SCENES FROM "TECUMSEH."[Q]\r\n\r\nCHARLES MAIR.--1840-\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE.--TECUMSEH\'S _Cabin_.\r\n\r\n_Enter_ IENA.\r\n\r\n_Iena._ \'Tis night, and Mamatee is absent still!\r\nWhy should this sorrow weigh upon my heart,\r\nAnd other lonely things on earth have rest?\r\nOh, could I be with them! The lily shone\r\nAll day upon the stream, and now it sleeps\r\nUnder the wave in peace--in cradle soft\r\nWhich sorrow soon may fashion for my grave.\r\nYe shadows which do creep into my thoughts--\r\nYe curtains of despair! what is my fault,\r\nThat ye should hide the happy earth from me?\r\nOnce I had joy of it, when tender Spring,\r\nMother of beauty, hid me in her leaves;\r\nWhen Summer led me by the shores of song,\r\nAnd forests and far-sounding cataracts\r\nMelted my soul with music. I have heard\r\nThe rough chill harpings of dismantled woods,\r\nWhen Fall had stripp\'d them, and have felt a joy\r\nDeeper than ear could lend unto the heart;\r\nAnd when the Winter from his mountains wild\r\nLook\'d down on death, and, in the frosty sky,\r\nThe very stars seem\'d hung with icicles,\r\nThen came a sense of beauty calm and cold,\r\nThat wean\'d me from myself, yet knit me still\r\nWith kindred bonds to Nature. All is past,\r\nAnd he--who won from me such love for him,\r\nAnd he--my valiant uncle and my friend,\r\nComes not to lift the cloud that drapes my soul,\r\nAnd shield me from the fiendish Prophet\'s power.\r\n\r\n_Enter_ MAMATEE.\r\n\r\nGive me his answer in his very words!\r\n\r\n_Mamatee._ There is a black storm raging in his mind--\r\nHis eye darts lightning like the angry cloud\r\nWhich hangs in woven darkness o\'er the earth.\r\nBrief is his answer--you must go to him.\r\nThe Long-Knife\'s camp-fires gleam among the oaks\r\nWhich dot yon western hill. A thousand men\r\nAre sleeping there cajoled to fatal dreams\r\nBy promises the Prophet breaks to-night.\r\nHark! \'tis the war-song.\r\n\r\n_Iena._                  Dares the Prophet now\r\nBetray Tecumseh\'s trust, and break his faith?\r\n\r\n_Mamatee._ He dares do anything will feed ambition.\r\nHis dancing braves are frenzied by his tongue,\r\nWhich prophesies revenge and victory.\r\nBefore the break of day he will surprise\r\nThe Long-Knife\'s camp, and hang our people\'s fate\r\nUpon a single onset.\r\n\r\n_Iena._              Should he fail?\r\n\r\n_Mamatee._ Then all will fail;--Tecumseh\'s scheme will fail.[R]\r\n\r\n_Iena._ It shall not! Let us go to him at once!\r\n\r\n_Mamatee._ And risk your life?\r\n\r\n_Iena._                        Risk hovers everywhere\r\nWhen night and man combine for darksome deeds.\r\nI\'ll go to him, and argue on my knees--\r\nYea, yield my hand--would I could give my heart\r\nTo stay his purpose and this act of ruin.\r\n\r\n_Mamatee._ He is not in the mood for argument.\r\nRash girl! they die who would oppose him now.\r\n\r\n_Iena._ Such death were sweet as life--I go! But, first--\r\nGreat Spirit! I commit my soul to Thee.      [_Kneels._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE.--_An open space in the forest near the Prophet\'s Town. A fire of\r\nbillets burning. War-cries are heard from the town._\r\n\r\n_Enter the_ PROPHET.\r\n\r\n_Prophet._ My spells do work apace! Shout yourselves hoarse,\r\nYe howling ministers by whom I climb!\r\nFor this I\'ve wrought until my weary tongue,\r\nBlister\'d with incantation, flags in speech,\r\nAnd half declines its office. Every brave\r\nInflamed by charms and oracles, is now\r\nA vengeful serpent, who will glide ere morn\r\nTo sting the Long-Knife\'s sleeping camp to death.\r\nWhy should I hesitate? My promises!\r\nMy duty to Tecumseh! What are these\r\nCompared with duty here? Where I perceive\r\nA near advantage, there my duty lies;\r\nConsideration strong which overweighs\r\nAll other reason. Here is Harrison--\r\nTrepann\'d to dangerous lodgment for the night--\r\nEach deep ravine which grooves the prairie\'s breast\r\nA channel of approach; each winding creek\r\nA screen for creeping death. Revenge is sick\r\nTo think of such advantage flung aside.\r\nFor what? To let Tecumseh\'s greatness grow,\r\nWho gathers his rich harvest of renown\r\nOut of the very fields that I have sown!\r\nBy Manitou, I will endure no more!\r\nNor, in the rising flood of our affairs,\r\nFish like an osprey for this eagle longer.\r\n                                           But, soft!\r\nIt is the midnight hour when comes\r\nTarhay to claim his bride. [_Calls._] Tarhay! Tarhay!\r\n\r\n_Enter_ TARHAY _with several braves._\r\n\r\n_Tarhay._ Tarhay is here!\r\n\r\n_Prophet._                The Long-Knives die to-night.\r\nThe spirits which do minister to me\r\nHave breathed this utterance within my ear.\r\nYou know my sacred office cuts me off\r\nFrom the immediate leadership in fight.\r\nMy nobler work is in the spirit-world,\r\nAnd thence come promises which make us strong.\r\nNear to the foe I\'ll keep the Magic Bowl,\r\nWhilst you, Tarhay, shall lead our warriors on.\r\n\r\n_Tarhay._ I\'ll lead them; they are wild with eagerness.\r\nBut fill my cold and empty cabin first\r\nWith light and heat! You know I love your niece,\r\nAnd have the promise of her hand to-night.\r\n\r\n_Prophet._ She shall be yours!\r\n            [_To the braves._] Go bring her here at once--\r\nBut, look! Fulfilment of my promise comes\r\nIn her own person.\r\n\r\n_Enter_ IENA _and_ MAMATEE.\r\n\r\n                   Welcome, my sweet niece!\r\nYou have forstall\'d my message by these braves,\r\nAnd come unbidden to your wedding-place.\r\n\r\n_Iena._ Uncle! you know my heart is far away--\r\n\r\n_Prophet._ But still your hand is here! this little hand!\r\n                                    [_Pulling her forward._\r\n\r\n_Iena._ Dare you enforce a weak and helpless girl,\r\nWho thought to move you by her misery?\r\nStand back! I have a message for you too.\r\nWhat means the war-like song, the dance of braves,\r\nAnd bustle in our town?\r\n\r\n_Prophet._              It means that we\r\nAttack the foe to-night.\r\n\r\n_Iena._                  And risk our all?\r\nO that Tecumseh knew! his soul would rush\r\nIn arms to intercept you. What! break faith,\r\nAnd on the hazard of a doubtful strife,\r\nStake his great enterprise and all our lives!\r\nThe dying curses of a ruin\'d race\r\nWill wither up your wicked heart for this!\r\n\r\n_Prophet._ False girl! your heart is with our foes;\r\nYour hand I mean to turn to better use.\r\n\r\n_Iena._ Oh, could it turn you from your mad intent\r\nHow freely would I give it! Drop this scheme,\r\nDismiss your frenzied warriors to their beds;\r\nAnd, if contented with my hand, Tarhay\r\nCan have it here.\r\n\r\n_Tarhay._         I love you, Iena!\r\n\r\n_Iena._ Then must you love what I do! Love our race!\r\n\'Tis this love nerves Tecumseh to unite\r\nIts scatter\'d tribes--his fruit of noble toil,\r\nWhich you would snatch unripen\'d from his hand,\r\nAnd feed to sour ambition. Touch it not--\r\nOh, touch it not, Tarhay! and though my heart\r\nBreaks for it, I am yours.\r\n\r\n_Prophet._                 His anyway,\r\nOr I am not the Prophet!\r\n\r\n_Tarhay._                For my part\r\nI have no leaning to this rash attempt,\r\nSince Iena consents to be my wife.\r\n\r\n_Prophet._ Shall I be thwarted by a yearning fool!      [_Aside._\r\nThis soft, sleek girl, to outward seeming good,\r\nI know to be a very fiend beneath--\r\nWhose sly affections centre on herself,\r\nAnd feed the gliding snake within her heart.\r\n\r\n_Tarhay._ I cannot think her so--\r\n\r\n_Mamatee._                        She is not so!\r\nThere is the snake that creeps among our race;\r\nWhose venom\'d fangs would bile into our lives,\r\nAnd poison all our hopes.\r\n\r\n_Prophet._                She is the head--\r\nThe very neck of danger to me here,\r\nWhich I must break at once! [_Aside._] Tarhay--attend!\r\nI can see dreadful visions in the air;\r\nI can dream awful dreams of life and fate;\r\nI can bring darkness on the heavy earth;\r\nI can fetch shadows from our fathers\' graves,\r\nAnd spectres from the sepulchres of hell.\r\nWho dares dispute with me, disputes with death!\r\nDost hear, Tarhay?\r\n\r\n[TARHAY _and braves cower before the_ PROPHET.\r\n\r\n_Tarhay._          I hear, and will obey.\r\nSpare me! Spare me!\r\n\r\n_Prophet._          As for this foolish girl,\r\nThe hand she offers you on one condition,\r\nI give to you upon a better one;\r\nAnd, since she has no mind to give her heart--\r\nWhich, rest assured, is in her body still--\r\nThere,--take it at my hands!\r\n\r\n[_Flings_ IENA _violently towards_ TARHAY, _into whose arms she falls\r\nfainting, and is then borne away by_ MAMATEE.\r\n\r\n[_To_ TARHAY.] Go bring the braves to view the Mystic Torch\r\nAnd belt of Sacred Beans grown from my flesh--\r\nOne touch of it makes them invulnerable--\r\nThen creep, like stealthy panthers, on the foe!\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE.--_Morning. The field of Tippecanoe after the battle. The ground\r\nstrewn with dead soldiers and warriors._\r\n\r\n_Enter_ HARRISON, _officers and soldiers, and_ BARRON.\r\n\r\n_Harrison._ A costly triumph reckon\'d by our slain!\r\nLook how some lie still clench\'d with savages\r\nIn all-embracing death, their bloody hands\r\nGlued in each other\'s hair! Make burial straight\r\nOf all alike in deep and common graves:\r\nTheir quarrel now is ended.\r\n\r\n_1st Officer._              I have heard\r\nThe red man fears our steel--\'twas not so here;\r\nFrom the first shots, which drove our pickets in,\r\nTill daylight dawn\'d, they rush\'d upon our lines,\r\nAnd flung themselves upon our bayonet points\r\nIn frenzied recklessness of bravery.\r\n\r\n_Barron._ They trusted in the Prophet\'s rites and spells,\r\nWhich promis\'d them immunity from death.\r\nAll night he sat on yon safe eminence,\r\nHowling his songs of war and mystery,\r\nThen fled, at dawn, in fear of his own braves.\r\n\r\n_Enter an_ AIDE.\r\n\r\n_Harrison._ What tidings bring you from the Prophet\'s Town?\r\n\r\n_Aide._ The wretched women with their children fly\r\nTo distant forests for concealment. In\r\nTheir village is no living thing save mice\r\nWhich scamper\'d as we oped each cabin door.\r\nTheir pots still simmer\'d on the vacant hearths,\r\nStanding in dusty silence and desertion.\r\nNaught else we saw, save that their granaries\r\nWere cramm\'d with needful corn.\r\n\r\n_Harrison._                     Go bring it all--\r\nThen burn their village down!      [_Exit_ AIDE.\r\n\r\n_2nd Officer._                This victory\r\nWill shake Tecumseh\'s project to the base.\r\nWere I the Prophet I should drown myself\r\nRather than meet him.\r\n\r\n_Barron._             We have news of him--\r\nOur scouts report him near in heavy force.\r\n\r\n_Harrison._ \'Twill melt, or draw across the British line,\r\nAnd wait for war. But double the night watch,\r\nLest he should strike, and give an instant care\r\nTo all our wounded men: to-morrow\'s sun\r\nMust light us on our backward march for home.\r\nThence Rumor\'s tongue will spread so proud a story\r\nNew England will grow envious of our glory;\r\nAnd, greedy for renown so long abhorr\'d,\r\nWill on old England draw the tardy sword!\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE.--_The Ruins of the Prophet\'s Town._\r\n\r\n_Enter the_ PROPHET, _who gloomily surveys the place._\r\n\r\n_Prophet._ Our people scatter\'d, and our town in ashes!\r\nTo think these hands could work such madness here--\r\nThis envious head devise this misery!\r\nTecumseh, had not my ambition drawn\r\nSuch sharp and fell destruction on our race\r\nYou might have smiled at me! for I have match\'d\r\nMy cunning \'gainst your wisdom, and have dragg\'d\r\nMyself and all into a sea of ruin.\r\n\r\n_Enter_ TECUMSEH.\r\n\r\n_Tecumseh._ Devil! I have discover\'d you at last!\r\nYou sum of treacheries, whose wolfish fangs\r\nHave torn our people\'s flesh--you shall not live!\r\n\r\n[_The_ PROPHET _retreats facing and followed by_ TECUMSEH.\r\n\r\n_Prophet._ Nay--strike me not! I can explain it all!\r\nIt was a woman touch\'d the Magic Bowl,\r\nAnd broke the brooding spell.\r\n\r\n_Tecumseh._                   Impostor! Slave!\r\nWhy should I spare you?      [_Lifts his hand as if to strike._\r\n\r\n_Prophet._              Stay, stay, touch me not!\r\nOne mother bore us in the self-same hour.\r\n\r\n_Tecumseh._ Then good and evil came to light together.\r\nGo to the corn-dance, change your name to villain!\r\nAway! Your presence tempts my soul to mischief.\r\n                                          [_Exit the_ PROPHET _hastily._\r\nWould that I were a woman, and could weep,\r\nAnd slake hot rage with tears! O spiteful fortune,\r\nTo lure me to the limit of my dreams,\r\nThen turn and crowd the ruin of my toil\r\nInto the narrow compass of a night!\r\nMy brother\'s deep disgrace--myself the scorn\r\nOf envious harriers and thieves of fame,\r\nWho fain would rob me of the lawful meed\r\nOf faithful services and duties done--\r\nOh, I could bear it all! But to behold\r\nOur ruin\'d people hunted to their graves--\r\nTo see the Long-Knife triumph in their shame--\r\nThis is the burning shaft, the poison\'d wound\r\nThat rankles in my soul! But, why despair?\r\nAll is not lost--the English are our friends.\r\nMy spirit rises--manhood bear me up!\r\nI\'ll haste to Malden, join my force to theirs,\r\nAnd fall with double fury on our foes.\r\nFarewell ye plains and forests, but rejoice!\r\nYe yet shall echo to Tecumseh\'s voice.\r\n\r\n_Enter_ LEFROY.\r\n\r\n_Lefroy._ What tidings have you glean\'d of Iena?\r\n\r\n_Tecumseh._ My brother meant to wed her to Tarhay--\r\nThe chief who led his warriors to ruin;\r\nBut, in the gloom and tumult of the night,\r\nShe fled into the forest all alone.\r\n\r\n_Lefroy._ Alone! In the wide forest all alone!\r\nAngels are with her now, for she is dead.\r\n\r\n_Tecumseh._ You know her to be skilful with the bow.\r\n\'Tis certain she would strike for some great Lake--\r\nErie or Michigan. At the Detroit\r\nAre people of our nation, and perchance\r\nShe fled for shelter there. I go at once\r\nTo join the British force.      [_Exit_ TECUMSEH.\r\n\r\n_Lefroy._                  But yesterday\r\nI climb\'d to Heaven upon the shining stairs\r\nOf love and hope, and here am quite cast down.\r\nMy little flower amidst a weedy world,\r\nWhere art thou now? In deepest forest shade?\r\nOr onward, where the sumach stands array\'d\r\nIn autumn splendor, its alluring form\r\nFruited, yet odious with the hidden worm?\r\nOr, farther, by some still sequester\'d lake,\r\nLoon-haunted, where the sinewy panthers slake\r\nTheir noon-day thirst, and never voice is heard\r\nJoyous of singing waters, breeze or bird,\r\nSave their wild wailings.--[_A halloo without._] \'Tis Tecumseh calls!\r\nOh Iena! If dead, where\'er thou art--\r\nThy saddest grave will be this ruin\'d heart!      [_Exit._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Q] These scenes are enacted at the "Prophet\'s Town," an Indian\r\nvillage, situated at the junction of the Tippecanoe river with the\r\nWabash, the latter a tributary of the Ohio. Tecumseh is gone on a\r\nmission to the Southern Indians to induce them to unite in a\r\nconfederation of all the Indian tribes, leaving his brother, the\r\nProphet, in charge of the tribes already assembled, having strictly\r\nenjoined upon him not to quarrel with the Americans, or Long-Knives,\r\nas the Indians called them, during his absence. General Harrison,\r\nGovernor of Indiana, and commander of the American forces, having\r\nlearned of Tecumseh\'s plans, marches to attack the Prophet; but the\r\nlatter, pretending to be friendly, sends out some chiefs to meet\r\nHarrison. By the advice of these chiefs, the Americans encamp on an\r\nelevated plateau, near the Prophet\'s Town,--"a very fitting place,"\r\nto the mind of Harrison\'s officers, but to the practised eye of\r\nHarrison himself, also well fitted for a night attack by the Indians.\r\nHe, therefore, very wisely makes all necessary preparations for\r\ndefence against any sudden attack. Tecumseh has left behind him,\r\nunder the protection of the Prophet, his wife, Mamatee, and his\r\nniece, Iena. He is accompanied on his mission by Lefroy, an English\r\npoet-artist, "enamoured of Indian life, and in love with Iena." The\r\nProphet, who is hostile to Lefroy, intends to marry Iena to Tarhay,\r\none of his chiefs, but Mamatee has gone to intercede with her\r\nbrother-in-law for Iena, and, if possible, to turn him from his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[R] Tecumseh had long foreseen that nothing but combination could\r\nprevent the encroachments of the whites upon the Ohio, and had long\r\nbeen successfully endeavoring to bring about a union of the tribes\r\nwho inhabited its valley. The Fort Wayne treaties gave a wider scope\r\nto his design, and he now originated his great scheme of a federation\r\nof the entire red race. In pursuance of this object, his exertions,\r\nhitherto very arduous, became almost superhuman. He made repeated\r\njourneys, and visited almost every tribe from the Gulf of Mexico to\r\nthe Great Lakes, and even north of them, and far to the west of the\r\nMississippi. In order to further his scheme he took advantage of his\r\nbrother\'s growing reputation as a prophet, and allowed him to gain a\r\npowerful hold upon the superstitious minds of his people by his\r\npreaching and predictions. The Prophet professed to have obtained\r\nfrom the Great Spirit a magic bowl, which possessed miraculous\r\nqualities; also a mystic torch, presumably from Nanabush, the keeper\r\nof the sacred fire. He asserted that a certain belt, said to make\r\nthose invulnerable who touched it whilst in his hands, was composed\r\nof beans which had grown from his flesh; and this belt was circulated\r\nfar and wide by Indian runners, finding its way even to the Red River\r\nof the North. These, coupled with his oratory and mummeries, greatly\r\nenhanced an influence which was possibly added to by a gloomy and\r\nsaturnine countenance, made more forbidding still by the loss of an\r\neye. Unfortunately for Tecumseh\'s enterprise, the Prophet was more\r\nbent upon personal notoriety than upon the welfare of his people;\r\nand, whilst professing the latter, indulged his ambition, in\r\nTecumseh\'s absence, by a precipitate attack upon Harrison\'s force on\r\nthe Tippecanoe. His defeat discredited his assumption of supernatural\r\npowers, led to distrust and defection, and wrecked Tecumseh\'s plan of\r\nindependent action. But the protection of his people was Tecumseh\'s\r\nsole ambition; and, true statesman that he was, he joined the British\r\nat Amherstburg (Fort Malden), in Upper Canada, with a large force,\r\nand in the summer of 1812 began that series of services to the\r\nBritish interest which has made his name a household word in Canada,\r\nand endeared him to the Canadian heart.--_From_ AUTHOR\'S NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCV.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
