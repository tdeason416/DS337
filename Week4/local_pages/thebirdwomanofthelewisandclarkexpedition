men the way into the West.\r\nThere were no roads to the West then.\r\nThat was one hundred years ago.\r\nThis Indian woman took the white men across streams.\r\nShe took them over hills.\r\nShe took them through bushes.\r\nShe seemed to find her way as a bird does.\r\nThe white men said, "She goes like a bird.\r\nWe will call her the Bird-Woman."\r\nHer Indian name was Sacajawea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClark   A mer i can   Lew is\r\nmet   cap tains   part\r\nsol diers   twen ty nine   peo pie\r\nMis sou ri Riv er\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO THE WHITE MEN WERE.\r\n\r\nThe white men Sacajawea went with were soldiers.\r\nThere were twenty-nine soldiers.\r\nThere were two captains.\r\nThe name of one captain was Lewis.\r\nThe name of the other captain was Clark.\r\nThey were American soldiers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN CLARK.]\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN LEWIS.]\r\n\r\nThey carried the American flag into the West.\r\nNo white men knew about that part of the West then.\r\nThe captains wished to learn all about the West.\r\nThey wished to tell the people in the East about it.\r\nThey had been going West a long time before they met Sacajawea.\r\nThey had rowed up the Missouri River.\r\nThey had come to many little streams.\r\nThey did not know what the Indians called these streams.\r\nSo they gave them new names for the white men.\r\n\r\n\r\ncamp   Fourth

named another Independence Creek.\r\nWe still call this stream by that name.\r\nYou can find it on the map of Kansas.\r\nOn Fourth of July the men rested.\r\nThe soldier who woke first fired a gun.\r\nThen they all woke up and cheered for the Fourth of July.\r\nAt night they fired another gun.\r\nThen the soldiers danced around the camp fire.\r\nAfter a time the ice and snow would not let them go on.\r\nThey made a winter camp near the Mandan Indians.\r\nHere they met Sacajawea and her husband.\r\nHer husband was a Frenchman who knew a little about the West.\r\nSacajawea was the only one there who had been to the far West.\r\nLewis and Clark told the Frenchman they would pay him to go with them.\r\nHe said he would go.\r\nThen he and Sacajawea came to live at the soldiers\' camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe longed   roots   tribe\r\nmar ried   Snake   twelve\r\nRocky Mountains   thought   war\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY SACAJAWEA WENT WEST.\r\n\r\nSacajawea belonged in the West.\r\nHer tribe was called the Snake Indians.\r\nThey lived in the Rocky Mountains.\r\nSacajawea lived in the Mountains until she was twelve years old.\r\nThen her tribe went to war with the Mandans from the East.\r\nOne day Sacajawea and some other girls were getting roots.\r\nThey were down by a stream.\r\nSome Mandans came upon them.\r\nThe girls ran fast to get away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANDAN DRAWING ON A BUFFALO ROBE]\r\n\r\nSacajawea ran into the stream.\r\nAn Indian caught her.\r\nHe took her up on his horse.\r\nHe carried her away to the East, to the country of the Mandans.\r\nThere she married the Frenchman.\r\nThere the Americans found her.\r\nShe was glad when her husband said he would go West with Lewis and\r\nClark.\r\nShe thought she would see her own tribe again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan i mals    coun try    friends\r\nmed i cine    read y    chiefs\r\nfroz en   plants   wrote\r\nfort   sweat   house\r\n\r\n\r\nAT FORT MANDAN.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers called their winter camp Fort Mandan.  They had a hard\r\nwinter there.\r\nIt was so cold that many men were ill.\r\nThey had no time to be ill.\r\nThey had to work to be ready to go West when Spring opened.\r\nThe captains wrote in their books about the Indians and animals and\r\nplants they had seen.\r\nThey made maps of the country they had come through.\r\nThey had long talks with the Indian chiefs.\r\nThey made friends with the Indians by giving them medicine.\r\nAn Indian boy had his feet frozen near the soldiers\' camp.\r\nThe captains kept him until his feet were well again.\r\nHis people all came and thanked the captains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INDIAN SWEAT-HOUSE]\r\n\r\nThe Indians told each other about the white men\'s medicine.\r\nThey said, "The white men\'s medicine is better than our sweat-house."\r\nSo they came for miles to the white camp to get the medicine.\r\nThey gave the captains food.\r\nThey wanted to be friends with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nar rows   din ner   hunt ed\r\nmon ey   beads   fid dle\r\nknives   pie ces   blan kets\r\ngal lons   med als   stove\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soldiers hunted animals for food and for their skins.\r\nOne soldier cut an old stove into pieces.\r\nThe Indians wanted these pieces to make arrows and knives.\r\nThey would give eight gallons of corn for one piece.\r\nThe Indians did not know what money was.\r\nThe captains did not carry money with them.\r\nThey took flags and medals, knives and blankets, looking-glasses and\r\nbeads, and many other things.\r\nWith these they could get food from the Indians.\r\nOn Christmas Day, 1804, the soldiers put the American flag up over the\r\nfort.\r\nThey told the Indians not to come to see them on that day.\r\nThey said it was the best day of their year.\r\nIt was a cold day, with much ice and snow.\r\nThey had a good dinner and after dinner the soldiers danced.\r\nOn New Year\'s Day, 1805, they fired off all their guns.\r\nThe captains let the soldiers go to the Mandan camp.\r\nThey took their fiddle and danced for the Indians.\r\nOne soldier danced on his hands with his head down.\r\nThe Indians liked this dancing very much.\r\nThey gave the soldiers some corn and some skins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsur prised   hair   paint ed   stran ger\r\nfin ger   wa ter   helped   York\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK MAN.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clark had his black man, York, with him.\r\nThe Indians were always surprised to see the black man.\r\nThey thought he was stranger than the white men.\r\nOne Mandan chief said, "This is a white man painted black."\r\nHe wet his finger and tried to wash the black off York\'s skin.\r\nThe black would not come off.\r\nThen York took off his hat.\r\nThe chief had not seen such hair before.\r\nThen the chief said, "You are not like a white man.\r\nYou are a black man."\r\nThe Indians told each other of this black man.\r\nThey came from far to see him.\r\nYork helped make them friends with the whites.\r\nThe captains named a river for York.\r\nThe river had only a little water in it.\r\nThey named it York\'s Dry River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbas ket   laugh   weeks\r\nborn    su gar\r\n\r\n\r\nSACAJAWEA\'S BABY.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Mandan, Sacajawea\'s baby boy was born.\r\nHe was only eight weeks old when the white men began to go to the far\r\nWest.\r\nSacajawea made a basket of skins for her baby.\r\nShe put it on her back.\r\nThe baby could sleep in the basket as Sacajawea walked.\r\nThe soldiers liked the baby.\r\nThey gave it sugar.\r\nThey made it playthings of wood.\r\nThey danced to make it laugh.\r\nIndian babies do not laugh much and they do not cry much.\r\nOnce in the West the baby was ill.\r\nThen the soldiers camped for some days.\r\nThey were very still.\r\nCaptain Lewis gave the baby medicine.\r\nThis made the baby well again.\r\nThen the men laughed.\r\nThey said, "Let us sing and dance for the baby."\r\nThe baby laughed as it looked at the men.\r\n\r\n\r\nA pril    par ty   shot\r\nbroke    shoot

the soldiers.\r\nWhen the Indians saw a woman and a baby with the men, they knew it was\r\nnot a war party.\r\nIndians would not take a woman and baby to war.\r\nOnly men go to war.\r\nThe Indians did not shoot at the men.\r\nThey came up to see what they wanted.\r\nIf Sacajawea had not been there, they would have shot the white men.\r\nThe Indians thought that all strangers wanted war.\r\nThey thought this until the strangers showed that they were friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbare foot ed    cov ered       prick ly\r\nthrew           cor ners       pears\r\nsame            moc ca sins

Mountains\r\nshowed that they wanted to be friends in the same way.\r\nWhen they saw strangers, they stood still and talked to each other.\r\nIf they wished to be friends, the chief walked out ahead of his people.\r\nHe took off his blanket.\r\nHe took hold of it by two corners.\r\nHe threw it up high.\r\nThen he put it on the ground.\r\nThis showed that he was putting down a skin for a friend to sit on.\r\nHe did this three times.\r\nThen the strangers came up to him.\r\nThey sat down together.\r\nThey took off their moccasins.\r\nThis showed that they wished to be true friends.\r\nIf they were not true friends, they would go barefooted all their days.\r\nThey thought it hard to go barefooted.\r\nThe ground was covered with prickly pears.\r\nThe prickly pears would hurt their feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat    pres ents    smoked\r\npipes    send         Wash ing ton\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the strangers had their moccasins off, they smoked some pipes\r\ntogether.\r\nThen they gave each other presents.\r\nThen they told each other why they had come together.\r\nCaptain Lewis and Captain Clark always told the Indians:\r\n\r\n"We have come from the Great Father in Washington.\r\nHe sends you these presents.\r\nHe wants you to be friends with the white men.\r\nHe wants you to be friends with the other Indians.\r\nWhen you all are friends, the men can get many animals and the women can\r\nget many roots.\r\nThe Great Father will send you out the white men\'s goods when you are\r\nall friends."\r\n\r\nThe Indians always said to Lewis and Clark:\r\n\r\n"We are glad to hear from the Great Father in Washington.\r\nWe like his presents.\r\nWe shall be glad to get the white men\'s goods.\r\nWe will be friends with all men with Indians and with white men."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na fraid    com pass    canoe\r\nstraight ened    turned    hit\r\nrud der\r\n\r\n\r\nSACAJAWEA SAVES THE CAPTAINS\' GOODS.\r\n\r\nGoing up the Missouri, the compass, the books, and the maps were in one\r\ncanoe.\r\nThe captains had the compass to find the West.\r\nOne day a big wind hit this canoe and turned it nearly over.\r\nSacajawea\'s husband was at the rudder.\r\nHe was afraid and let go. The water came into the canoe.\r\nThe maps and books came up to the top of the water.\r\nSacajawea saw them going out into the river.\r\nShe took the compass into her lap.\r\nShe caught the books.\r\nShe called to her husband.\r\nHe took the rudder again.\r\nHe straightened the boat again.\r\nThen Sacajawea caught the maps that were on top of the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrook ed   Mon

the sun.\r\nWhen these were dry, they went on again.\r\nTen days after, they came to a river that no white man had seen before.\r\nCaptain Lewis wrote in his book, "It is a handsome river about 50 yards\r\nwide."\r\nThey did not know the Indian name for it.\r\nThe captains were so glad Sacajawea had saved their things that they\r\nnamed it for her.\r\nThey said, "We will call it the Sacajawea or Bird-Woman\'s River."\r\nThis river is still running.\r\nLook on a map of Montana.\r\nDo you see a stream named "Crooked Creek?"\r\nThat is the stream Lewis and Clark named Sacajawea\'s River.\r\nWhich do you think is the prettier name?\r\nWhich do you think we should call it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblew   elk   pleas ure\r\ncross   plains   steep\r\nbuf fa lo   mos qui toes

eyes.\r\nThe mosquitoes bit them all the time.\r\nBut still the soldiers were happy.\r\nThey carried their goods in boats.\r\nThey walked when they wished to.\r\nThey hunted buffalo and elk on the plains near the river.\r\nThey had all they wanted to eat.\r\nOne day in May, Captain Lewis was out hunting.\r\nHe went up a little hill.\r\nThen far off to the West he saw the Rocky Mountains high and steep.\r\nCaptain Lewis was the first white man to see these mountains.\r\nHe wrote in his book that he felt a great pleasure on first seeing them.\r\nHe knew they would be very hard to cross.\r\nThey were all white with snow.\r\nBut he was ready to go on so as to get to the West.\r\nHe went back to the boats and told the others about the mountains.\r\nThe men were happy and worked harder to get near them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrew   fell   hot   sul phur    worse\r\n\r\n\r\nSACAJAWEA IS ILL.\r\n\r\nGoing up the Missouri, Sacajawea fell ill.\r\nShe could not eat.\r\nShe grew worse each day.\r\nCaptain Clark gave her some medicine.\r\nIt did not make her well.\r\nThe soldiers had to camp until she could go on.\r\nThey could not go on without her.\r\nThey wanted her with them to make friends with her tribe.\r\nOne day the soldiers found a hot sulphur spring.\r\nThey carried Sacajawea to this spring.\r\nThe water made her well.\r\nIn a week she could go on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbank    killed    hole    to ward\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE INDIANS HUNTED BUFFALO.\r\n\r\nOn the plains of the Missouri there were many buffaloes.\r\nSacajawea told the soldiers how the Indians hunted them.\r\nAn Indian put on a buffalo skin.\r\nThe buffalo\'s head was over his head.\r\nHe walked out to where the buffaloes were eating.\r\nHe stood between them and a high bank of the river.\r\nThe other Indians went behind the buffaloes.\r\nThe buffaloes ran toward the man in the buffalo skin.\r\nHe ran fast toward the river.\r\nThen the buffaloes ran fast toward the river.\r\nAt the high bank the man ran down and hid in a hole.\r\nThe buffaloes came so fast that they could not stop at the bank.\r\nThey fell over the bank on to the rocks near the river.\r\nMany were killed.\r\nThen the Indians came around the bank.\r\nThey skinned the buffaloes.\r\nThey dried the meat.\r\nThey dried the skins to make blankets and houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune   won der ful

on fast.\r\nAfter walking seven miles, he came to the great Falls of the Missouri.\r\nHe was the first white man to see these Falls.\r\nHe sat down on a rock and watched the water dash and spray.\r\nHe tried to draw a picture of the Falls.\r\nHe tried to write about it in his book.\r\nBut he said it was so wonderful that he could not draw it well nor\r\npicture it in words.\r\nWhen the men came up, they could not take their boats near the Falls.\r\nThe Falls are very, very high.\r\nThe highest fall is eighty-seven feet high, and the water comes down\r\nwith a great rush.\r\nSo the soldiers had to go around the Falls.\r\nThat was a long, long way.\r\nIt would be hard to carry all their things around the Falls.\r\nThe captains said, "We will make a cache here.\r\n"We will put in the skins and plants and maps.\r\n"We can get them all again when we are coming home."\r\nThe soldiers made two caches.\r\nIn these they hid all the things they could do without.\r\nWithout so much to carry, it would not be so hard to go around the\r\nFalls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndried   dug   ring   sod\r\nbot tom   branch es   earth   sides\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CACHE NEAR THE FALLS OF THE MISSOURI.\r\n\r\nTo make a cache, the soldiers made a ring on the ground.\r\nThey took up the sod inside the ring.\r\nThey dug straight down for a foot.\r\nThey put dried branches on the bottom and at the sides of this hole.\r\nThey put dried skins over the branches.\r\nThen they put their goods into the hole, or cache.\r\nThey put dried skins over the goods.\r\nThen they put the earth in.\r\nThen they put the sod on.\r\nThe ring did not look as if it had been dug up.\r\nThe Indians would not think to look there for goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbite    fresh   rat tle snakes\r\ncure   morn ing

banks.\r\nSome times they went up trees and lay on the branches.\r\nOne night Captain Lewis was sleeping under a tree.\r\nIn the morning he looked up through the tree.\r\nHe saw a big rattlesnake on a branch.\r\nIt was going to spring at him.\r\nHe caught his gun and killed it.\r\nIt had seventeen rattles.\r\nSometimes the soldiers had to go barefooted.\r\nThe snakes bit their bare feet.\r\nSacajawea knew how to cure the bite.\r\nShe took a root she called the rattlesnake root.\r\nShe beat it hard.\r\nShe opened the snake bite.\r\nShe tied the root on it.\r\nShe put fresh root on two times a day.\r\nIt cured the snake bite.\r\nThe root would kill a man if he should eat it, but it will cure a snake\r\nbite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nax les   even   hail   tongues\r\nbears   e nough

the canoes on their backs.\r\nThey could see only one big tree on the plains.\r\nIt was a cottonwood.\r\nThe soldiers cut it down.\r\nThey cut wheels and tongues from it.\r\nThe cottonwood is not hard enough for axles.\r\nThe soldiers cut up the mast of their big boat for axles.\r\nThey began to go up the hill.\r\nIn a little time the axles broke.\r\nThey put in willow axles.\r\nThen the cottonwood tongues broke.\r\nThen the men had to carry the goods on their backs.\r\nIt was very hot.\r\nThe mosquitoes and blow-flies bit them all the time.\r\nThe prickly pear hurt their feet.\r\nIt hurt them even through their moccasins.\r\nIf they drank water, they were ill.\r\nOne day it hailed hard.\r\nThe hail knocked some of the men down.\r\nAt night the grizzly bears took their food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nload   point ed   large   safe\r\nmouth   roared   fierce   waist\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIZZLY BEARS.\r\n\r\nAfter many hard days, they got all the goods to the top of the Falls.\r\nThe party saw many grizzly bears near the Falls.\r\nThey were the first white men to see the grizzly bear.\r\nThey found it a very large and very fierce bear.\r\nOne day Captain Lewis was out hunting.\r\nHe had killed a buffalo for dinner.\r\nHe turned around to load his gun again.\r\nHe saw a big bear coming after him.\r\nIt was only twenty feet away.\r\nHe did not have time to load his gun.\r\nThere was no tree near.\r\nThere was no rock near.\r\nThe river bank was not high.\r\nCaptain Lewis ran to the river.\r\nThe bear ran after him with open mouth.\r\nIt nearly caught him.\r\nCaptain Lewis ran into the river.\r\nHe turned around when the water was up to his waist.\r\nHe pointed his gun at the bear.\r\nIt stopped still.\r\nThen it roared and ran away.\r\nCaptain Lewis did not know why the bear roared and ran, but he was glad\r\nto be safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nbody    de feat ed    shoul der\r\nbrave   ly ing        angry\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day six of the soldiers saw a big bear lying on a little hill near\r\nthe river.\r\nThe six soldiers came near him.\r\nThey were all good shots.\r\nFour shot at him.\r\nFour balls went into his body.\r\nHe jumped up.\r\nHe ran at them with open mouth.\r\nThen the two other men fired.\r\nTheir balls went into his body, too.\r\nOne ball broke his shoulder.\r\nStill he ran at them.\r\nThe men ran to the river.\r\nTwo jumped into their canoe.\r\nThe others hid in the willows.\r\nThey loaded their guns as fast as they could.\r\nThey shot him again.\r\nThe shots only made him angry.\r\nHe came very near two of the men.\r\nThey threw away their guns and jumped down twenty feet into the river.\r\nThe bear jumped in after them.\r\nHe nearly caught the last one.\r\nThen one soldier in the willows shot the bear in the head.\r\nThis shot killed him.\r\nThe soldiers pulled the bear out of the river.\r\nThey found eight balls in him.\r\nThey took his skin to show the captains.\r\nThey said he was a brave old bear.\r\nThey named a creek near-by for him.\r\nThey called it "The Brown-Bear-Defeated Creek."\r\n\r\n\r\nbe cause   fright ened\r\nclimb   kicked    wait\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day a grizzly bear ran after a soldier.\r\nThe soldier tried to shoot the bear.\r\nHis gun would not go off.\r\nThe gun was wet because he had been in the river all day.\r\nHe ran to a tree.\r\nHe got to the tree just in time.\r\nAs the soldier climbed, he kicked the bear.\r\nThe grizzly bear can not climb a tree.\r\nThis grizzly sat at the foot of the tree to wait until the soldier would\r\ncome down.\r\nThe soldier called out loud.\r\nTwo other soldiers heard him.\r\nThey came running to help him.\r\nThey saw the man in the tree.\r\nThey saw the bear at the foot of the tree.\r\nThey shot off their guns and made a big noise.\r\nThe grizzly grew frightened.\r\nIt ran away.\r\nThen the soldier came down from the tree.\r\nHe was glad that his friends had come to his help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na ble   beans   su

take them up the river.\r\nThey were camping at the top of the Falls on the Fourth of July, 1805.\r\nCaptain Lewis wrote that they had a good dinner that day.\r\nHe said they had as good as if they were at home.\r\nThey had "bacon, beans, buffalo meat, and suet dumplings."\r\nAfter dinner a soldier played the fiddle.\r\nCaptain Lewis wrote: "Such as were able to shake a foot amused\r\nthemselves in dancing on the green."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nburst   fif teen   ra vine\r\ncloud   clothes   wave\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOUD-BURST.\r\n\r\nOne day Captain Clark took Sacajawea and her husband with him to look\r\nover the top of the Falls.\r\nSacajawea\'s baby was in his basket on her back.\r\nCaptain Clark saw a black cloud.\r\nHe said, "It will rain soon.\r\nLet us go into that ravine."\r\nThey sat under some big rocks.\r\nSacajawea took off the baby\'s basket and put it at her feet.\r\nAll the baby\'s clothes were in the basket.\r\nSacajawea took the baby in her lap.\r\nIt began to rain a little.\r\nThe rain did not get to them.\r\nIt rained harder.\r\nThen the cloud burst just over the ravine.\r\nThe rain and hail made a big wave in the little ravine.\r\nCaptain Clark saw the wave coming.\r\nHe jumped up and caught his gun in his left hand.\r\nWith his right hand he pushed Sacajawea up the bank.\r\nThe wave was up to their waists.\r\nThey ran faster and got to the top of the bank.\r\nThen the wave was fifteen feet high.\r\nIt made a big noise as it ran down the ravine.\r\nSoon it would have caught them and carried them over the Falls.\r\nIt did carry away the baby\'s basket and his clothes, and Captain Clark\'s\r\ncompass.\r\nThe next day a soldier found the compass in the mud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na live   be stride   min er als   be gin ning\r\nra pid   nar row

narrow.\r\nIt was not deep, but it was rapid.\r\nThe soldiers had to pull the canoes with ropes.\r\nThe river did not run straight.\r\nOne day the men dragged the canoes twelve miles.\r\nThen they were only four miles from where they had started.\r\nThey had to walk in the river all day.\r\nTheir feet were cut by the rocks.\r\nThey were ill from being wet so much.\r\nIt was hot in the day and cold at night.\r\nThey had no wood but willow.\r\nThey could not make a good fire.\r\nBut they had enough to eat.\r\nThen the river grew very narrow.\r\nThe canoes could not go up it.\r\nThe soldiers put the canoes under water with rocks in them.\r\nThey made another cache.\r\nIn it they put skins, plants, seeds, minerals, maps, and some medicines.\r\nCaptain Lewis and some men went ahead.\r\nThey were looking for Indians.\r\nThey wanted to buy some horses.\r\nAfter a time the river grew so narrow that a soldier put one foot on one\r\nbank and his other foot on the other bank.\r\nThen he said, "Thank God, I am alive to bestride the mighty Missouri."\r\nBefore this, people did not know where the Missouri began.\r\nA little way off was the beginning of the mighty Columbia River.\r\nThe soldiers reached this place in August.\r\nCaptain Lewis was very happy as he drank some cold water from the\r\nbeginnings of these two rivers.\r\nCaptain Clark and the other men were coming behind.\r\nSacajawea was with them.\r\nThey had all the goods and walked slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na nise      grease        pound\r\nbread       mixed         pow der\r\nhun gry     mush

were glad that she did.\r\nThey had only a little corn left, and there were not many animals\r\nnear.\r\nSacajawea told Captain Clark all about the yamp plant, as her tribe knew\r\nit.\r\nIt grew in wet ground.\r\nIt had one stem and deeply cut leaves.\r\nIts stem and leaves were dark green.\r\nIt had an umbrella of white flowers at the top of the stem.\r\nThe Indian women watched the yamp until the stem dried up.\r\nThen they dug for the roots.\r\nThe yamp root is white and hard.\r\nThe Indians eat it fresh or dried.\r\nWhen it is dry, they pound it into a fine white powder.\r\nThe Indian women make the yamp powder into a mush.\r\nIndian children like yamp mush as much as white children like candy.\r\nIt tastes like our anise seed.\r\nThe soldiers liked the yamp mush that Sacajawea made.\r\nSacajawea also made a sunflower mush.\r\nShe roasted sunflower seeds.\r\nThen she pounded them into a powder and made a mush with hot water.\r\nShe made a good drink of the sunflower powder and cold water.\r\nShe mixed the sunflower powder with bear grease and roasted it on hot\r\nrocks.\r\nThis made a bread the soldiers liked very much.\r\nWithout Sacajawea the soldiers would have been hungry.\r\nThey did not know the plants.\r\nSome plants would kill them.\r\nBut Sacajawea knew those good to eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeet    sang    sucked\r\nown     short   taken\r\n\r\nSACAJAWEA\'S PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nOne day near the head of the Missouri, Sacajawea stopped short as she\r\nwalked.\r\nShe looked hard to the West.\r\nShe saw far away some Indians on horseback.\r\nShe began to dance and jump.\r\nShe waved her arms.\r\nShe laughed and called out.\r\nShe turned to Captain Clark and sucked her fingers.\r\nThis showed that these Indians were her own people.\r\nShe ran ahead to meet them.\r\nAfter a time a woman from the Indians ran out to meet Sacajawea.\r\nWhen they came together, they put their arms around each other.\r\nThey danced together.\r\nThey cried together.\r\nThis woman had been Sacajawea\'s friend from the time when they were\r\nbabies.\r\nShe had been taken East by the same Indians that took Sacajawea.\r\nOn the way East she got away from these Indians.\r\nShe found her way home.\r\nShe had been afraid she would never see Sacajawea again.\r\nNow they were happy to meet.\r\nThey danced and sang and cried and laughed with their arms around each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbroth er      sent       tied\r\n         sell       shells\r\n\r\n\r\nSACAJAWEA\'S BROTHER.\r\n\r\nThe party went with Sacajawea\'s people to their camp.\r\nCaptain Clark was taken to the chief\'s house.\r\nThe house was made of a ring of willows.\r\nThe chief put his arms about Captain Clark.\r\nHe made him sit on a white skin.\r\nHe tied in his hair six shells.\r\nEach one then took off his moccasins.\r\nThen they smoked without talking.\r\nWhen they wanted to talk, they sent for Sacajawea.\r\nShe came into the house and sat down.\r\nShe looked at the chief.\r\nShe saw that he was her brother.\r\nShe jumped up and ran to him.\r\nShe threw her blanket over his head.\r\nShe cried aloud in joy.\r\nHe was glad to see her.\r\nHe did not cry nor jump.\r\nHe did not like to show that he was glad.\r\nSacajawea told him about the white men.\r\nShe said they wanted to go across the Rocky Mountains to the Big Water\r\nin the West.\r\nShe did not know the way across the mountains.\r\nThe Indians could help them.\r\nThey could sell them horses and show them the way across the steep\r\nmountain tops.\r\n\r\n\r\nCa me ah wa it     kind\r\n\r\n\r\nSacajawea said the white men had many things the Indians would like.\r\nIf they found a good way over the mountains, the white men would send\r\nthese things to the Indians each summer.\r\nSacajawea said the white men were kind to her and her baby.\r\nIf they had not taken care of her when she was ill, she would not have\r\nseen her brother again.\r\nHer brother said he was glad that the white men had been kind to her.\r\nHe would help them over the mountains.\r\nHe would talk to his men about it.\r\nHe said to Captain Clark: "You have been kind to Sacajawea.\r\nI am your friend until my days are over.\r\nYou shall own my house.\r\nYou shall sit on my blanket.\r\nYou shall have what I kill.\r\nYou shall bear my name.\r\nMy name belonged to me only, but now it is yours.\r\nYou are Cameahwait."\r\nAfter that, all this tribe called Captain Clark "Cameahwait."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAh hi e!      death     oars     pleased\r\nbought        nev er    sad dles\r\n\r\n\r\nSACAJAWEA\'S PEOPLE WILL SHOW THE WAY.\r\n\r\nCameahwait told his people how good the white men were.\r\nHe told them what good things they had.\r\nHe said, "If we sell them horses and take them over the mountains, they\r\ncan get back soon.\r\nNo goods will come to us until they go back to their home.\r\nIf we do not help them, they cannot cross the mountains.\r\nThey do not know the way.\r\nThey cannot carry food enough.\r\nThey will meet death in the mountains.\r\nThen we shall never get their goods.\r\nShall we help them, my brothers?"\r\n\r\nAnd the people said, "Ah hi e! Ah hi e!"\r\nThat means, "We are pleased."\r\nThey got horses to carry the goods.\r\nThey could not get enough horses to give the men to ride.\r\nThe captains bought a horse for Sacajawea  to ride.\r\nThe soldiers made saddles from the oars tied together with pieces of\r\nskins.\r\nThen they started up the steep mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheard    must    to-night    slipped\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDIANS TRY TO LEAVE THE WHITES.\r\n\r\nWhen they were in the mountain tops, Sacajawea overheard some Indians\r\ntalking.\r\nThey said: "We do not want to go across the mountains with the whites.\r\nWe want to go down to the plains and hunt buffalo.\r\nWe are hungry here.\r\nOn the plains are many buffalo.\r\nWe must hunt them now for our winter food.\r\nWe do not care for the white men\'s goods.\r\nOur fathers lived without their goods.\r\nWe can live without them.\r\nWe will go off to-night and leave them.\r\nThey will meet death in the mountains.\r\nIn the Spring we can come back and get their goods."\r\n\r\nSacajawea went to Captain Lewis.\r\nShe told him what she had heard.\r\nHe called the chiefs together.\r\nThey smoked a pipe together.\r\nSacajawea slipped a piece of sugar into Cameahwait\'s hand.\r\nAs he sucked it, she said, "You will get this good thing from the white\r\nmen if you are friends with them."\r\n\r\n\r\ngone      land       word\r\nkeep      prom ise   yes\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Captain Lewis said, "Are you men of your word?"\r\n\r\nThe Indians said, "Yes."\r\n\r\nHe said, "Did you not promise to carry our goods over the mountains?"\r\n\r\nThe Indians said, "Yes."\r\n\r\n"Then," he said, "why are you going to leave us now?\r\nIf you had not promised, we would have gone back down the Missouri.\r\nThen no other white man would come to your land.\r\nYou wish the whites to be your friends.\r\nYou want them to give you goods.\r\nYou should keep you promise to them.\r\nI will keep my promise to you.\r\nYou seem afraid to keep your promise."\r\n\r\nThe chiefs said, "We are not afraid.\r\nWe will keep our promise."\r\n\r\nThey sent out word to all their men to keep their promise.\r\nCaptain Lewis thanked Sacajawea.\r\nIf she had not told him, the Indians would have gone off in the night.\r\nThe whites would have been left in the steep Rocky Mountains with no\r\nhorses and no way of getting food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstiff    Pa cif ic    O cean\r\nmelt     sharp        trip\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSSING THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\nThe trip across the mountains was very hard.\r\nThe mountain tops were steep.\r\nThere was no road.\r\nThe ground was made of sharp rocks.\r\nThe horses slipped and fell down.\r\nThe men\'s feet were cut and black and blue.\r\nIt rained many days and snowed nights.\r\nThey had no houses.\r\nBefore they could start on each day, they had to melt the snow off their\r\ngoods.\r\nThe men grew stiff from the wet and the cold.\r\nThe only way they could get warm was to keep on walking.\r\nThey had little food.\r\nThey had only a little corn when they started across the mountains.\r\nThis was soon gone.\r\nThere were no animals, no fish, and no roots on the way.\r\nThey had to kill their horses.\r\nThey had only horsemeat to eat.\r\nThe soldiers grew sick.\r\nSome could hardly stand.\r\nBut they did not want to turn back.\r\nThey knew the Indians could find the way down to the Columbia River.\r\nThen they could get to the Pacific Ocean without the Indians.\r\nSo they went on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsud den ly     fun     salm on

Indians near the Columbia.\r\nThese Indians gave the men salmon and roots.\r\nThey ate so much that they were ill.\r\nThe captains and all the soldiers were ill.\r\nBut they started to make canoes to ride down the Columbia.\r\nThey did not get well.\r\nSo they bought some dogs.\r\nThey cooked the dogs and ate them.\r\nFor days they could eat only dog.\r\nThe Indians laughed at them for eating dog.\r\nThey said, "Dogs are good to watch the camp.\r\nThey are not good to eat.\r\nWe do not eat them.\r\nWhat poor men these must be to eat dog!"\r\nSuddenly the captains fired off their guns and a soldier played the\r\nfiddle.\r\nThen the Indians stopped laughing.\r\nThey had never heard a gun before.\r\nThey had never before heard a fiddle.\r\nThey thought the white men must be wonderful people to have guns and\r\nfiddles.\r\nThey wished to be friends with such wonderful people.\r\nSo they did not make fun of them any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfull      grass      stones\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE INDIANS DRIED SALMON.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers left their horses here on the Columbia River.\r\nThey asked the Indians to keep them until they should come back from the\r\nWest.\r\nThen they started down the river in canoes.\r\nOn the Columbia, the party saw some Indians drying salmon.\r\nThey opened the fish.\r\nThen they put it in the sun.\r\nWhen it was well dried, they pounded it to powder between two stones.\r\nThen they put it into a basket.\r\nThe basket was made of grass.\r\nIt had dried salmon skin inside.\r\nThe Indians pounded the powdered salmon down hard into the basket.\r\nWhen a basket was full, they put dried salmon skin on the top.\r\nThen the basket was put where it would keep dry.\r\nThe salmon powder would keep for years.\r\nOnly one tribe of Indians knew how to make it well.\r\nThe other tribes bought it from them.\r\nAll the tribes liked it.\r\nThe white men, too, liked it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngath ered      ar row head\r\n   sum mer          wap

arrowhead.\r\nThe wappato grew all the year.\r\nThe Indian women gathered it.\r\nA woman carried a light canoe to a pond.\r\nShe waded into the pond.\r\nShe put the canoe on the water.\r\nWith her toes she pulled up the wappato from the bottom of the pond.\r\nThe woman caught it and put it in the canoe.\r\nShe was in the water many hours, summer and winter.\r\nWhen her canoe was full, she put it on her head and carried it home.\r\nShe roasted the wappato on hot stones.\r\nIt tasted very good.\r\nThe soldiers said it was the best root they had tasted.\r\nThe Indian women used to put some wappato in grass baskets and sell it\r\nto the tribes up the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanx ious      cheer ful      view\r\nbreak ing     dis tinct ly   shores\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN.\r\n\r\nThe party went down the Columbia River in canoes.\r\nIt was a hard trip.\r\nIt rained all the time.\r\nEach day the men were wet to the skin.\r\nThey had to carry their goods around some rapids.\r\nThey could not be very cheerful.\r\nOne day it stopped raining for a little time.\r\nThe low clouds went away.\r\nThe party saw that the river was very wide.\r\nThey rowed on.\r\nThen they saw the great ocean lying in the sun.\r\nThey became very happy.\r\nThey cheered and laughed and sang.\r\nThey rowed on very fast.\r\nCaptain Lewis wrote in his book:\r\n"Ocean in view! O! the joy! We are in VIEW of the Ocean, this great\r\nPacific Ocean, which we have been so long anxious to see. The noise made\r\nby the waves breaking on the rocky shores may be heard distinctly."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhalf    for got    jour ney    troub les\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PACIFIC OCEAN.\r\n\r\nThe party saw that they had come to the end of their journey.\r\nThey had come 4,134 miles from the mouth of the Missouri River.\r\nIt had taken them a year and a half to come.\r\nBut now they forgot their troubles.\r\nThey forgot the times they had been hungry.\r\nThey forgot their cut feet and their black and blue backs.\r\nThey forgot the bears and the snakes and the mosquitoes.\r\nThey saw the Pacific Ocean before them.\r\nThey sang because they were the first white men to make this journey.\r\nThey did not care for the troubles going back.\r\nThey knew that they could go home faster than they had come.\r\nAnd they sang together, "The Ocean! The Ocean! O joy! O joy!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeach     blub ber    line    thun der\r\nClat sop  salt        whale   sand\r\n\r\n\r\nSACAJAWEA ON THE OCEAN BEACH.\r\n\r\nThe party made a winter camp at the mouth of the Columbia River.\r\nThey called it Fort Clatsop.\r\nThe Indians near-by were the Clatsop tribe.\r\nThese Indians gave the whites some whale blubber.\r\nThey said that a whale was on the ocean beach.\r\nCaptain Clark and some men got ready to go to see it.\r\nSacajawea came to Captain Clark and said, "May I go, too?\r\nI have come over the mountains with you to find the Great Water and I\r\nhave not been to it yet.\r\nNow I would see the Big Animal and the Great Water, too."\r\nCaptain Clark was glad to have her go.\r\nHe wrote in his book that this was the only time she asked for anything.\r\nShe took her baby on her back and walked with Captain Clark.\r\nWhen she got near the ocean, she was afraid.\r\nThe noise seemed to her like thunder.\r\nShe always had been afraid of thunder.\r\nWhen she saw the waves, she was afraid they would come over the earth.\r\nShe had never before seen any big body of water.\r\nShe had seen only rivers and ponds.\r\nThe ocean looked very big.\r\nShe would not go near the waves.\r\nThen Captain Clark showed her the high water line.\r\nHe told her that the waves would not go over that line.\r\nShe sat down on the sand with her baby in her lap.\r\nShe watched the waves a long time.\r\nThen she was not afraid.\r\nShe walked out to the waves.\r\nWhen they came to shore, she ran before them.\r\nShe let them come over her feet.\r\nShe took some ocean water in her hand and tasted it.\r\nShe did not like its salt taste.\r\nBut she did like to run after the waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbags      oil      wood en\r\neight y   pork

animal.\r\nIt was longer than most houses.\r\nIt was eighty feet long.\r\nThe Indians were cutting it up.\r\nThey put the meat into a large wooden trough.\r\nThen they put hot stones into the trough.\r\nThe hot stones melted out the oil.\r\nThe Indians put the oil into skin bags.\r\nThey used it to eat with roots and mush.\r\nThey did not wish to sell the oil.\r\nBut after a time, they did sell some oil to Captain Clark.\r\nThey sold him some blubber, too.\r\nThe blubber was white and looked like pork fat.\r\nThe soldiers cooked some and ate it.\r\nThey liked it very much.\r\nSacajawea was happy to see the whale.\r\nShe walked all around it.\r\nShe made her baby to look well at it.\r\nShe told him he might never see one again.\r\nThe baby did not care for the whale, but he laughed because Sacajawea\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeau ti ful    robe         sor ry\r\nbelt           sea-ot ter   wear\r\n\r\n\r\nSACAJAWEA\'S BELT.\r\n\r\nThe Clatsop chief came to Fort Clatsop to see the captains.\r\nHe had on a robe made of two sea-otter skins.\r\nThe skins were the most beautiful the captains had yet seen.\r\nThey wanted the chief to sell the robe.\r\nHe did not want to sell it, as sea-otters are hard to get.\r\nThey said they would give him anything they had for it.\r\nStill he would not sell it.\r\nSacajawea saw him looking at her blue bead belt.\r\nShe had made this belt from beads Captain Clark had given her.\r\nShe used to wear it all the time.\r\nShe said to the Clatsop chief, "Will you sell the robe for my belt?"\r\nHe said, "Yes, I will sell it for the chief beads."\r\nThe Indians called blue beads "chief beads."\r\nSacajawea thought a little time.\r\nThen she gave her belt to him.\r\nHe put it around his neck.\r\nHe gave her his sea-otter robe.\r\nShe gave it to Captain Clark for a present.\r\nShe was sorry to give up her belt.\r\nThe captains had no more blue beads to give her to make another.\r\nBut she was glad to give Captain Clark the beautiful sea-otter skins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nboiled     crust      five      pairs\r\nburned     filled     kegs      treat\r\n\r\n\r\nAT FORT CLATSOP.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Clatsop, the captains wrote in their books.\r\nThey wrote about all they had seen coming to the Pacific.\r\nThey wrote about things near Fort Clatsop.\r\nThey made maps of the land near the Missouri River, in the Rocky\r\nMountains, and on the banks of the Columbia.\r\nSome of the men hunted.\r\nThey made the skins of animals into clothes and moccasins.\r\nThey made between three and four hundred pairs of moccasins.\r\nThey saved these to wear on the way home.\r\nFive soldiers were sent down to the ocean beach to make salt.\r\nEach had a big kettle.\r\nThey filled the kettles with ocean water.\r\nThey burned a fire under the kettles day and night.\r\nIn time, the water all boiled away.\r\nA crust of salt was left on the inside of the kettles.\r\nThe soldiers gathered this salt into wooden

that he did not care if he had salt or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nhand ker chief      un der wear      wea sel\r\nmer ry              wak en           wel come\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day, 1805, the soldiers got up without making any noise.\r\nThey fired their guns all at one time to waken the captains.\r\nThen they sang an old Christmas song.\r\nThen they wished the captains "Merry Christmas."\r\nThey gave each other presents.\r\nCaptain Clark wrote that he had twelve weasel tails, some underwear,\r\nsome moccasins, and an Indian blanket for his Christmas presents.\r\nHe gave a handkerchief or some little present to each man.\r\nThere was no snow and no ice, but there was much rain.\r\nThe soldiers had to stay in their log fort all day.\r\nThey had only poor elk, poor roots, and some bad dried salmon for\r\ndinner.\r\nBut they were cheerful.\r\nThey danced and sang into the night.\r\nOn New Year\'s Day, they fired their guns to welcome in the New Year.\r\nThey had more to eat than on Christmas Day.\r\nThe captains wrote, "Our greatest pleasure to-day is thinking about\r\nNew Year\'s, 1807. Then we shall be home."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngame      or der      let ters      stol en\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE START HOME.\r\n\r\nIn March, the elk left the woods near Fort Clatsop.\r\nThe soldiers could not get enough to eat.\r\nThe captains said, "It is time to start home."\r\nThey bought a canoe with a soldier-coat and some little things.\r\nThey took another canoe from the Clatsops for some elk meat that the\r\nIndians had stolen.\r\nThey had not many things left to get food and horses with on the way\r\nhome.\r\nBut their guns were in good order.\r\nThey had good powder and balls.\r\nThey could kill game on the way.\r\nThey cut up their big flag into five robes.\r\nThey could sell them robes for food.\r\nThe captains gave the Clatsops letters to give to any white men who\r\nshould come there.\r\nThese letters told about the party\'s trip out West.\r\nThey told how they were going back East.\r\nThe Clatsops promised to give these letters to the first white men who\r\nshould come.\r\nThen the party said good-bye to the Clatsops.\r\nThis was in the month of March.\r\nThey started up the Columbia River, singing.\r\nThey were happy because they were going home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nawl            nee dles skeins\r\nCho pun nish   ounce    thread\r\nknit ting-pin  rib bon  ver mil ion\r\n\r\n\r\nAT CAMP CHOPUNNISH.\r\n\r\nOn the way up the Columbia, the soldiers killed game.\r\nThey gave some to the Indians for roots.\r\nThey came to the foot of the mountains in May.\r\nThere was too much snow then for them to cross\r\nThey made a camp near the Chopunnish Indians.\r\nThey called it Camp Chopunnish.\r\nThey sent out to get the horses they had left when camping there before.\r\nThey tried to get enough food to last them over the mountains.\r\nMany of the Indians were ill.\r\nCaptain Clark gave them medicine.\r\nThey gave him food and horses for the medicine.\r\nCaptain Lewis talked with the Indian chiefs all day.\r\nThey promised to let some young Indians show the way over the mountains.\r\nThe captains gave each soldier some of their goods and sent him out to\r\nget food.\r\nCaptain Lewis wrote that each man had "only one awl and one knitting-\r\npin, half an ounce of vermilion, two needles, a few skeins of thread,\r\nand a yard of ribbon."\r\nTwo of the men took their goods with them in a canoe.\r\nThe canoe turned over.\r\nThey lost all their goods.\r\nThey just saved their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nbot tles   bush els   pris on ers\' base\r\nbox es     but tons   raft  ra ces\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo other men went up the river with their goods on a horse.\r\nThe horse slipped down a steep bank into the river.\r\nHe got safe to the bank across the river.\r\nAn Indian made him swim back to the two soldiers.\r\nOn the way, most of the goods were lost.\r\nThe paint melted, and the horse\'s back was all red.\r\nThe Indians on the bank across the river saw what the soldiers wanted.\r\nThey loaded some roots and bread on a raft.\r\nThey tried to cross to the soldiers.\r\nA high wind sent the raft on a rock.\r\nThe raft turned over.\r\nThe roots and bread were lost.\r\nThen the captains and men felt unhappy.\r\nThey cut the buttons from their clothes.\r\nThey gathered up all the bottles and medicine boxes they had.\r\nWith these things, two soldiers went out to get food.\r\nThey got three bushels of roots and some bread.\r\nThe other men hunted.\r\nThey dried some meat, and gave some to the Indians for roots.\r\nThey became good friends with the Chopunnish Indians.\r\nThey used to run fast races together.\r\nBoth soldiers and Indians could run fast.\r\nThe soldiers took sides and played prisoners\' base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\near ly      sec ond          fold ed\r\nmeans       Yo me kol

started to go without the Indians.\r\nThey could not find food for the horses.\r\nThere was snow all over the ground.\r\nThey had to turn back and camp where there was grass.\r\nA week later the Indians were ready to go with them.\r\nThey started a second time.\r\nThe Indians showed them the way.\r\nThey found food for the horses each night.\r\nThe trip across the mountains was not so hard as it had been the year\r\nbefore.\r\nNow the snow covered all the sharp rocks.\r\nThe snow was so hard that the horses could walk on it.\r\nNow they had enough food.\r\nAll the men had horses.\r\nThey went many miles each day.\r\nAll were happy.\r\nOne of the Indians liked Captain Lewis so much that he gave him his\r\nname, "Yomekollick."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOMEKOLLICK]\r\n\r\nThis means "White Bear-skin Folded."\r\nThe Indians thought their names were the best thing they could give to\r\nany one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndif fer ent    di vide      ser vice    third\r\ngood-bye       south

shall see more of the country east of the Rocky Mountains."\r\n\r\nSo Captain Lewis and nine men started in a straight line to the Falls of\r\nthe Missouri.\r\nCaptain Clark and the others went more to the South.\r\nSacajawea went with Captain Clark.\r\nThe two parties promised to meet again down on the Missouri.\r\nThey said good-bye to each other on July third.\r\nOn the next day, Captain Clark wrote that they had a good Fourth of July\r\ndinner.\r\nThey had fat deer and roots.\r\nThen they went on until time to sleep.\r\nThey had no time to dance now.\r\nThey were going home.\r\nCaptain Lewis and his men pushed on all day.\r\nHe did not write that they thought of the Fourth of July.\r\nCaptain Clark sent ten men down the Missouri River the way they had\r\ncome West.\r\nHe went with Sacajawea and ten other men across to the Yellowstone\r\nRiver.\r\nSacajawea found the way for him.\r\nShe also found roots good to eat.\r\nCaptain Clark wrote that she was of "great service" to him.\r\nCaptain Clark\'s party went down the Yellowstone River to the Missouri\r\nRiver.\r\nHere they met two white men.\r\nThese were the first white men besides themselves that they had seen for\r\na year and four months.\r\nThey were glad to hear news from the East.\r\nSoon after they met these white men, Captain Lewis and the other\r\nsoldiers came down to them.\r\nThis was in August.\r\nCaptain Lewis had been shot by one of his best men.\r\nThe man thought that Captain Lewis was an elk, because his clothes were\r\nbrown.\r\nThe man was very sorry for having shot him.\r\nCaptain Lewis soon got well.\r\nThe soldiers were happy to be together again.\r\nThey forgot their troubles.\r\nThey went down the Missouri, singing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE AS DRAWN BY CAPTAIN LEWIS IN HIS\r\nJOURNAL]\r\n\r\nThey were glad they had gone West.\r\nThey had taken the country for the Americans.\r\nThey had made friends with the Indians.\r\nThey knew where food could be found.\r\nThey knew about the animals and plants.\r\nNow other people could find the way from the maps the captains had made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndol lars     vil

LODGE]\r\n\r\nSo Sacajawea had to say good-bye to the soldiers.\r\nThe captains gave her husband five hundred dollars.\r\nThey did not give Sacajawea any money.\r\nIn those days, people did not think of paying women.\r\nAll the party were sorry to leave Sacajawea and the baby.\r\nSacajawea was sorry to stay behind.\r\nShe stood on the bank of the river watching the soldiers as long as she\r\ncould see them.\r\nThe soldiers went down the Missouri to its mouth.\r\nWhen they saw the village there, they fired off all their guns.\r\nThe people came out to see them and cheered that they were home again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCen ten nial     Port land     Or e gon\r\nfor est ry       build ing     not ed\r\nfair      hon or     stat ue   suc cess\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTENNIAL.\r\n\r\nThe American people have always been glad that Lewis and Clark made this\r\nlong, hard journey.\r\nThat was just one hundred years ago.\r\nIn this year of 1905, the American people are holding a centennial fair\r\nin honor of the Lewis and Clark journey.\r\nThe Fair is at Portland, Oregon, because Lewis and Clark reached the\r\nPacific Ocean in Oregon.\r\nAt the Fair, there is a statue of Sacajawea and her baby.\r\nThis statue is put there because Lewis and Clark wrote in their books:\r\n"The wonderful Bird-Woman did a full man\'s share to make the trip a\r\nsuccess, besides taking care of her baby. She was one of the best of\r\nmothers."\r\nSome day, you can read these books for yourself, and learn more about\r\nSacajawea and Captains Lewis and Clark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FORESTRY BUILDING, LEWIS AND CLARK CENTENNIAL]\r\n\r\nThe forestry building is made from the large trees for which Oregon is\r\nnoted.\r\nFort Clatsop was built from the large trees of Oregon, too, but the\r\nsoldiers did not know how to make such a fine building as this one\r\nhundred years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Bird-Woman of the Lewis and Clark\r\nExpedition, by Katherine Chandler\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BIRD-WOMAN ***\r\n\r\nThis file should be named 5742.txt or 5742.zip\r\n\r\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, Charles Franks\r\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.
