A little later\r\non we saw some of the crops sown, such as barley and turnips. In summer\r\nwe were in the hay-and corn-fields, and later still we saw the ricks\r\nbeing made.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are at Willow Farm again, and I want to show you some of the\r\nflowers that grow there. I do not mean those which Mrs. Hammond, the\r\nfarmer\'s wife, grows in her garden, pretty as they are. We will look\r\nrather at the wild flowers in the fields, the hedges, and by the\r\nroad-side in the lane. No one sows their seed nor takes care of them in\r\nany way; yet they grow and blossom year after year, and nearly all of\r\nthem are beautiful.\r\n\r\nBefore we begin to look at them we must make sure that we quite\r\nunderstand just what a flower is. Even those of you who live in large\r\ntowns and have perhaps never been in the country, see flowers of some\r\nsort, I feel sure; you see them in shop windows and they are also often\r\nsold in the streets. You have seen wallflowers and daffodils in the\r\nspring, roses in the summer, violets in winter, as well as other kinds.\r\nYou do not need to be told that these are flowers.\r\n\r\nWhat about the grass on lawns, and in such places as Battersea Park and\r\nHyde Park in London? "Oh," you say, "that is not a flower at all--that\r\nis just grass." Yes, it is grass, but the grass has a flower as well as\r\na rose bush or a violet-plant. It is only because the grass is kept cut\r\nshort that you do not see its flower on a lawn. If grass is not cut, or\r\neaten by animals, it grows tall in spring; then in May or June you would\r\nsee the flowers on tall straight stems which stand among the blades of\r\ngrass. Many of these grass flowers are very beautiful and we will look\r\npresently at some of them in one of the farmer\'s fields.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of you have gardens or grass plots at your own homes. If\r\nyou see some dandelions in the lawn, or groundsel among the flowers or\r\nvegetables in the garden beds, you say, "Those weeds must be pulled up."\r\nYou call the Dandelion and the Groundsel weeds, but they have flowers\r\nall the same; the Dandelion is perhaps one of the most lovely yellow\r\nflowers that we have.\r\n\r\nThey are weeds certainly in your lawn or garden beds, for they ought not\r\nto be there. Weeds are plants in the wrong place. By and by, in the\r\nfarmer\'s fields, we shall see many pretty flowers which he calls weeds.\r\nWe speak of the Nettle as a weed, and do not usually admire it; yet the\r\nNettle has a flower, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nThen what do you think of a tree having a flower? That is perhaps a new\r\nidea to you. Yet if you look at a Horse-chestnut tree in June you will\r\nsee at once the large spikes of beautiful white flowers with which it is\r\ncovered. Apple trees have a beautiful pink, or pink and white flower,\r\nand the Almond tree bears a lovely pink flower. All other trees have\r\nflowers too, but they are often small. The flowers of the Oak and the\r\nBeech are small, but, though you may not notice them, they are on the\r\ntree each spring.\r\n\r\nAlmost all plants, including large trees, have flowers--they are\r\nflowering plants. Just a few plants have no flower; ferns have none, nor\r\nhave the mosses and lichens which grow on walls and rocks and on the\r\nstems of trees. Fungi, too, such as the mushroom, have no flowers.\r\nNearly all other plants have flowers. It is by the flower or blossom\r\nthat a plant is reproduced. After the flower has faded comes the fruit\r\nand seed; the seed falls into the ground or is sown, and from it springs\r\nanother plant. Without the flower there would be no seed.\r\n\r\nYou see that there are rather more flowers than you had thought. Still,\r\nwhile we are strolling in the fields and lanes at Willow Farm, we shall\r\nlook most at what are generally called flowers; we shall look at\r\ncomparatively small plants in which the flower or blossom is easily\r\nnoticed because it is large, or bright-coloured, or sweet-scented. But\r\nwhile we are admiring a Daisy or a Dandelion in the spring, we must not\r\nforget that the great Oak-tree above it also has a flower of its own--we\r\nmust remember that the Oak-tree also is a flowering plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIN THE COPPICE\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside the front door of Willow Farm is a broad curving gravel drive,\r\nat the far end of which a white gate opens into the lane. On one side of\r\nthis drive is a narrow strip of ground planted with flowers and shrubs,\r\nand close to the front door there is a patch of grass on which stands a\r\nlarge old mulberry tree.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the drive is a lawn. Beyond that are more flowers\r\nand then the vegetable garden; further on still is a little wood or\r\ncoppice of nut bushes. On this March morning we shall find some wild\r\nflowers in this little wood.\r\n\r\nBetween the vegetable garden and the wood is a low grassy bank. It is\r\nbright to-day with yellow primroses. The Primrose always blossoms early\r\nhere, for the bank is sunny and is sheltered from cold winds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRIMROSE.]\r\n\r\nI daresay most of you have seen a Primrose before to-day. Each pale\r\nyellow blossom is made up of five petals, which are joined together\r\nforming a tube or corolla. The petals are notched or indented on the\r\nouter edge. At the centre of the blossom, where the petals meet, each\r\npetal is marked with a spot of darker yellow. Each flower grows alone on\r\na long slender stem. At the top of the stem is a kind of green tube out\r\nof which the yellow blossom appears. The Primrose blossoms have a scent;\r\nnot strong, but very sweet and pleasant.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are called "radical" or "root" leaves. They are so called\r\nbecause each leaf _appears_ to grow direct from the root. But the leaves\r\nreally grow from a short stem at the top of the root--a stem so short\r\nthat it does not appear above the ground at all.\r\n\r\nAmong the bushes of the coppice itself we will notice the flowers which\r\nfirst catch our eye--the pretty blossoms of the Wood Anemone. The whole\r\ncoppice is starred with the beautiful white flowers. We pick one and see\r\nthat it has six--six what? "Six petals," you say. No, these are not\r\npetals, for the Anemone has none. They are sepals. The sepals of a plant\r\ngenerally enclose the blossom before it is opened, and they are usually\r\ngreen. In the Anemone the petals are absent; the sepals take their place\r\nand are white instead of green. Their under side is often not pure\r\nwhite, but is streaked with pale pink.\r\n\r\nSeveral blossoms which we pick have six of these sepals. That is the\r\nusual number, but sometimes there are only five, and sometimes more than\r\nsix.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms of the Anemone grow on longer and stronger stalks than\r\nthose of the Primrose, and on each stalk are three leaves. These leaves\r\ngrow round the stalk in a ring. Each leaf is "tri-partite"--in three\r\nparts or divisions; the edges of these divided leaves are deeply\r\nserrated. Besides the three leaves on each flower-stalk similar leaves\r\ngrow from underground stems which creep along not far below the surface\r\nof the soil. Such creeping underground stems are usually called\r\n"rhizomes."\r\n\r\nAt the further side of the coppice, where a hedge separates it from the\r\nlittle meadow called Home Close, are Sweet Violets. We catch their\r\nfragrant scent before we see them, for the tiny flowers are half hidden\r\namong broad green leaves. Each blossom has five petals of a dark purple\r\ncolour; there are white Sweet Violets too, but none are growing in our\r\nlittle wood to-day.\r\n\r\nAt the base of the blossom--the part where it joins the stem--one of the\r\npetals has a little spur which points back towards the stem. The blossom\r\nis therefore said to be spurred; we may presently see other plants with\r\nspurred flowers.\r\n\r\nThere is another violet which grows wild in England--the Dog Violet. It\r\nis larger than our Sweet Violets here, but it has no scent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANEMONE.]\r\n\r\nWhile we have been examining the flowers on the ground, the nut bushes\r\nabove our heads are waiting to remind us of what we said just now--that\r\ntrees also have flowers. The flowers of the nut bush or hazel are easily\r\nseen, for they appear before the leaves are open. What we see to-day are\r\noften called catkins, but the name which country children give them is\r\nlambs\'-tails. It is a very good name, too, for they are more like the\r\ntail of some tiny lamb than anything else.\r\n\r\nThese catkins are yellowish-white in colour, and soft and almost woolly\r\nto the touch. They hang in clusters from the hazel twigs, and in the\r\nstrong March wind which blows to-day, they shake and flutter like the\r\ntails of lambs at play. Some of them leave a dusty powder on our fingers\r\nwhen we handle them; that is the pollen of the flower.\r\n\r\nIt is not where these yellow "catkins" are dancing on the twigs to-day\r\nthat the hazel nuts will appear in autumn. The nuts will grow on twigs\r\nwhere there are very small red flowers--something like tiny\r\npaint-brushes. These are the female flowers; they will be fertilized by\r\nthe yellow pollen of the catkins, and will produce the nuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFLOWERS ON THE WALLS\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind the narrow strip of ground with flowers and shrubs on the other\r\nside of the drive there is a low stone wall. A piece of the lawn on\r\nwhich the mulberry tree stands has been cut away, and a flight of steps\r\nleads down to a little gate into the foldyard.\r\n\r\nThis wall between the garden and the foldyard is very old and rough--not\r\nlike the smooth brick walls you see in towns. The stones are of\r\ndifferent shapes and sizes, the mortar has fallen out of it in many\r\nplaces, and here and there are holes and crevices. Yet it is a very\r\nbeautiful old wall, for many things grow on it; mosses and grasses, and\r\nother flowers too, are there.\r\n\r\nOn this May morning we not only see, but also smell, one of the flowers\r\nwhich grow upon the wall--it is the beautiful sweet-scented Wallflower.\r\nIt grows here and there along the top of the wall, and a few plants of\r\nit are even springing from the sides. Some of the plants are quite large\r\nand their stems are tough. These have grown here for a long time. The\r\nWallflower is a perennial plant; unless it is killed or torn up by the\r\nroots it will live and grow for many years. Others are quite young and\r\nonly a few inches high. These have grown from seeds dropped last autumn\r\nby the older plants.\r\n\r\nYou very likely wonder how the Wallflower or any other plant can grow\r\nupon the wall, for there is no earth to be seen--nothing but stones and\r\ncrumbling mortar. But if we pull up one of the smaller plants we shall\r\nfind earth clinging to its roots. Dry dusty earth has been blown upon\r\nthe wall by wind, and has lodged in chinks and holes. Dust and soil,\r\ntoo, were mixed with the mortar when the wall was built; and dead leaves\r\nfalling on it and decaying have produced a little more--for decayed\r\nleaves make earth or "soil." Wallflowers and other plants which grow on\r\nwalls and rocks find very little soil sufficient for their needs.\r\n\r\nMost of the blossoms of the wallflowers upon this wall are of a golden\r\nyellow colour and are very sweet. Some of the blossoms are, however, a\r\ndarker yellow than others, and here and there are petals which are quite\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the garden behind us we shall see that Mrs. Hammond has\r\nseveral beds of Wallflower this year; it is a flower of which she is\r\nvery fond. There are wallflowers of two different colours in her beds.\r\nOne kind has bright golden blossoms, rather deeper in colour than any of\r\nthose upon the wall; the other has flowers that are a rich dark brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALLFLOWER.]\r\n\r\nThese plants are sturdier and more bushy than those upon the wall, and\r\nthere are more flowers on each plant. The flowers are finer, too, and\r\nhave a stronger scent. If Mrs. Hammond had wished she could have sown\r\nseed to produce many different shades of brown and yellow Wallflowers.\r\nShe might also have had a purple Wallflower, and even a Wallflower of so\r\npale a yellow as to be almost white.\r\n\r\nIf you and I were clever gardeners and had plenty of time and patience,\r\nwe could get purple or nearly white wallflowers from these\r\nyellow-flowered plants upon the wall. It would perhaps take us many\r\nyears, but we should succeed at last. This is how we should set about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSuppose that we wished to have a Wallflower nearly white. We should look\r\ncarefully along the wall in spring, when the blossoms are out, until we\r\nfound the very palest yellow blossom we could see. We should mark that\r\nplant, and when the flower was over and the seed was ripe, we should\r\ncollect the seed. Among the plants grown from this seed we should choose\r\nagain the plant that had the palest flowers, and should save the seed\r\nfrom _that_. We might have to go on doing this for twenty years or more,\r\nbut in time we should have a Wallflower so pale as to be almost white.\r\n\r\n_Quite_ white we should never get our Wallflower, for no _pure_ white\r\nflower can be obtained from a yellow one. However pale our Wallflower\r\nmight be there would still always be just a tinge of yellow or cream\r\ncolour in it.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we wanted a purple or a very dark brown\r\nWallflower, we should save seed from those blossoms which were nearest\r\nto the colour we wanted--dark brown or with a tinge of purple in them.\r\nWe should sow seed from the darkest blossoms again and again, and at\r\nlast we should get what we wished to have.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED VALERIAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STINGING NETTLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE DEAD NETTLE.]\r\n\r\nBesides choosing seed from the lightest or darkest blossoms, we should\r\ntend our plants very carefully and well, giving them plenty of good rich\r\nsoil. This would make them grow bushy and with many flowers, as we see\r\nthem in Mrs. Hammond\'s garden beds.\r\n\r\nMany of our garden flowers have been produced in this way, by selecting\r\nand improving wild flowers. Of course all flowers grow wild _somewhere_;\r\nsome in England, but many more in foreign countries, where the air is\r\nwarmer and the soil richer and better. The Pansy is a little English\r\nwild flower with yellow, blue, and red petals. From this little flower\r\ngardeners have produced large and beautiful pansies of many different\r\ncolours and shades of colours--white, yellow, blue, and brown. This has\r\nbeen done by careful selection, just as we spoke of doing with the\r\nwallflowers.\r\n\r\nBut if the large single-coloured pansies of which I have told you, or\r\nMrs. Hammond\'s dark brown wallflowers, were allowed to seed\r\nthemselves--that is, were allowed to drop and sow their own seed year\r\nafter year--do you know what would happen? They would gradually revert\r\nor turn back to their original form and colour. The flowers would become\r\nmixed in colour and less fine in size; at last they would be simple wild\r\nflowers again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PANSY.]\r\n\r\nNow it is June, and the blossoms of the Wallflower have faded and\r\nfallen. The old wall is, however, growing gay with another plant--the\r\nRed Valerian. We must be careful to remember that it is the Red\r\nValerian, for there are other valerians. There is the Great Valerian\r\nwhich does not grow on walls or rocks, but in damp and shady places; its\r\nflowers are pale pink.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms of the Red Valerian on the wall are bright crimson, and\r\nthey grow in rows on small stems which spring from a stout stalk a foot\r\nor two in height. Each blossom of five petals forms a little tube or\r\ncorolla. The base or foot of each little tube appears as a point on the\r\nunder side of the flower stem; the Red Valerian, like the Violet, is a\r\nspurred flower.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are long and pointed, and they grow in pairs, on opposite\r\nsides of the stalk. Sometimes the edges of the leaves are quite smooth;\r\nsometimes they are serrated, or toothed, like the edge of a saw. If we\r\npulled a plant of Red Valerian from the wall we should find the roots\r\nvery long and branching; they need to be so, for the plant often grows\r\non rocks and other places where it is exposed to wind. If the roots had\r\nnot a firm hold the tall stems laden with blossoms might be blown down.\r\n\r\nThe Red Valerian flowers all through the summer. Its clusters of crimson\r\nflowers are as great an ornament to the old wall as were the wallflowers\r\nin May.\r\n\r\nNow let us go down the steps into the foldyard; there is a wall on\r\neither side of us as we descend. The wall which faces the north is\r\nnearly always in shadow, and there are ferns growing but of it between\r\nthe stones. One of these is a beautiful Hartstongue fern, with large and\r\nshining leaves. We said just now, however, that ferns have no flowers,\r\nso we will turn to something that grows on the wall opposite.\r\n\r\nThis is the ivy-leaved Toadflax. It grows on walls and rocks, as the Red\r\nValerian does, but it is a very different plant in appearance. The stems\r\nof the Red Valerian are tall and upright; those of the Toadflax are\r\nslender and drooping. There is a large mass of it on the side of the\r\nwall, and we find that the root is at the highest point of the whole\r\nmass. The stems with the flowers and leaves hang down below the root; it\r\nis a trailing plant.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other roots clinging to the wall here and there\r\nbelow the main root. The plant, like several others, is able to throw\r\nout fresh roots from the joints of its stems, and these give it a firmer\r\nhold.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are small, and their colour is a pale lilac-blue with a\r\nbright yellow spot in the centre. These flowers too are spurred. The\r\nleaves are smooth and thick--what is called fleshy. They are divided\r\ninto five lobes or divisions, and are not unlike an ivy-leaf in shape.\r\nWhen we turn a leaf or two over we see that the under side of some is\r\ndark purple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IVY-LEAVED TOADFLAX.]\r\n\r\nThis little plant is usually said to prefer a damp situation, and to\r\nblossom from May till October. This wall beside the steps is certainly\r\nrather damp, for the moisture from the garden above soaks down to it. In\r\nmy own garden, however, the ivy-leaved Toadflax grows on some very dry\r\nold walls, and I have found it in flower in the middle of December.\r\n\r\nNeither the Toadflax nor the Red Valerian are really natives of England.\r\nThey were brought to our country many hundreds of years ago. They have\r\nspread so much that they have now become wildflowers. In the same way\r\nmany others of our wild flowers were once unknown in England.\r\n\r\nNow that we have come down the steps into the foldyard we see that it\r\nlies a good deal below the house and garden. Built round the foldyard\r\nare the stables for the cart-horses, the cowhouses, and the great barn.\r\nBehind the stables is the rickyard. That, like the garden, is above the\r\nfoldyard; from it there are only two or three steps to the door of the\r\nloft or "tallet" above the stables. It is there that we will go now.\r\n\r\nThe wall of the tallet is of stone and is very old; the roof is tiled.\r\nThere is a little hole cut in the bottom of the door, and you will see\r\none like it in the door of the granary. It is made so that old Tib and\r\nthe other cats can go in and catch mice. Growing between the stones of\r\nthe wall just by the tallet door is the plant I want to show you now.\r\n\r\nIt is the Stonecrop. Some of the stems grow upright, while others are\r\ntrailing. At the top of each upright stem is a cluster of bright yellow\r\nflowers. Some of these are fully open, and we see that each blossom has\r\nfive pointed petals. The trailing stems have no flowers at all, they are\r\nbarren; but the leaves on the barren stems are much more numerous and\r\ncloser together than those on the upright flowering stems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMON STONECROP.]\r\n\r\nThese leaves are very curious. They are not flat like the leaves of the\r\nRed Valerian, the Toadflax, and most other flowers; they are very thick\r\nand fleshy--something like a short round pointed stick. They grow close\r\nagainst the stalk, not in pairs, but alternately, first a leaf on one\r\nside of the stalk, then a leaf on the other. They are erect too; that\r\nis, they point in the same direction as the stalk.\r\n\r\nOn the barren stems the leaves grow so closely that they quite cover the\r\nstalk. They have a hot sharp taste, and the plant is sometimes called\r\n"Wall-Pepper." The roots are very thin and can spread easily through\r\nnarrow chinks of the wall.\r\n\r\nWe will see one more plant of the walls before we look for flowers\r\nelsewhere. Our next plant is not very common at Willow Farm; still I\r\nknow where to look for it. Built against one side of the big barn in the\r\nfoldyard is a little lean-to shed. Often there are calves in it; but\r\njust now we are more interested in something that is on the roof.\r\n\r\nStanding close to the wall of the shed is a cattle crib--a kind of big\r\nsquare box or trough on legs, in which hay or chaff is put for the\r\ncattle. The shed is not very high, and by standing on the crib we can\r\nscramble on to the roof. Here is the plant we want to see.\r\n\r\nIt is the Houseleek, of which a clump is growing between the tiles.\r\nAlmost flat on the tiles is a dense mass of large green fleshy leaves.\r\nThese leaves are evergreen, they do not die and fall off in winter. From\r\nthis cluster of leaves rise straight thick stems nearly a foot high. The\r\nstems are thickly covered with erect leaves which grow smaller towards\r\nthe top of the stem.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the stem is a cluster of very handsome rosy-red flowers.\r\nEach blossom is star-shaped when fully open, and generally has twelve\r\npetals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE LEEK.]\r\n\r\nIf we could see the roots we should find them very thread-like or\r\nfibrous, like those of other flowers we have been looking at to-day. I\r\ndo not think I can very well show you the roots, however; we should have\r\nto pull up a plant, and that would not please Ben, the cowman, at all.\r\nThere is a belief in country places that it is bad luck to disturb the\r\nHouseleek--that someone in the house on which it grows is sure to die\r\nsoon afterwards. Certainly the plant is not growing on a house\r\nhere--only on the calves\' cot. Still, if any misfortune should happen to\r\nthe calves we might be blamed by Ben. Besides, it would be a pity to\r\ndisturb so handsome a plant, would it not?\r\n\r\nWe have spent some time in looking at these flowers on the walls and\r\nroof because we think them very wonderful. We see how little soil they\r\ncan have in which to grow, and how, in dry weather, they can have very\r\nlittle moisture either. Yet the leaves of several of them are thick and\r\nfleshy, and the flowers of some are large and beautiful. What could be\r\nmore handsome than the blossoms of the Wallflower, the Red Valerian, and\r\nthe Houseleek?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHREE HANDSOME WEEDS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the drive, near the front door, another white gate leads\r\nto the "nag" stables, where Mr. Hammond keeps the two horses which he\r\nrides and drives. Billy, the old brown pony, has a little stable of his\r\nown close by, and further on are the granary and the poultry yard.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have heard the saying, "Ill weeds grow apace." It is\r\ncertainly a true one, for most of the plants which we call weeds grow\r\nquickly and well wherever they are allowed to remain. We shall not have\r\nfar to look for the three weeds which I want to show you this morning.\r\nThe first of them is the Stinging Nettle. It grows round the wood-pile\r\nin the middle of the poultry-yard, and there are great clumps of it\r\nbeside the hedge which divides the poultry-yard from the kitchen garden.\r\n\r\nIt is really a very handsome plant, though you may not have thought so\r\nbefore. Look how tall and straight the stems are, and how evenly and\r\nregularly the dark green pointed leaves grow from it. They grow in\r\npairs, on opposite sides of the stem, and are serrated. There is\r\nsomething rather unusual about the stem of the Nettle which we will\r\nnotice at once. I have brought out a pair of thick leather gloves, so\r\nthat we can pick a stem without being stung.\r\n\r\nYou know what shape the trunks of trees are. Round? Yes; round or nearly\r\nso. So are the stems of most plants; the stems of the Red Valerian are\r\nround. The stem of the Nettle, however, is square, or if not perfectly\r\nsquare, it has four distinct sides. Perhaps you had never noticed this\r\nbefore, for the Nettle is certainly not a plant with which one cares to\r\nhave very much to do.\r\n\r\nBoth the stems and leaves are covered with tiny hairs. These hairs are\r\nreally small hollow tubes ending in a sharp point. When the Nettle\r\nstings you it first pricks the skin with these sharp points, and then a\r\ndrop of poison falls from the tube into the wound the point has made.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to get stung by a nettle do _not_ bathe your hand with\r\ncold water; that will only make the pain worse. While you are waiting\r\nfor the pain to pass off remember that in India there are nettles whose\r\nsting causes great pain which lasts for several days. You might be much\r\nworse off, you see!\r\n\r\nThe small greenish-yellow flowers of the Stinging Nettle grow in long\r\nfeathery clusters on stalks which spring from the main stem close to a\r\npair of leaves.\r\n\r\nThe young leaves of the Nettle are said to be very nice boiled as\r\nvegetables; I cannot say that I have ever eaten them myself. Years ago\r\ncountry people used to take a great deal of nettle tea as medicine in\r\nspring. Nowadays they seem to prefer patent medicines from the chemist\'s\r\nshop. A dye is made from the roots of the Nettle, and another dye from\r\nthe stem and leaves. The young leaves or tops, when chopped up, are good\r\nfor poultry, especially for turkeys. So nettles are useful, you see--not\r\nmerely stinging weeds. The Nettle, too, is a relation of the hemp plant\r\nfrom which we get our string and ropes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRAVELLER\'S JOY.]\r\n\r\nYou may sometimes see or hear of the White, Red, and Yellow Dead Nettle,\r\nbut these are not really nettles at all. Their leaves are somewhat\r\nsimilar, but they are quite different plants.\r\n\r\nHanging over this great patch of nettles by the hedge there is another\r\nweed, the Traveller\'s Joy, or Old Man\'s Beard. Its stem has climbed not\r\nonly up the hedge, but high into a hawthorn bush which stands there. It\r\nhas many small white feathery flowers with a pleasant scent. On each\r\nleaf stem there are usually five leaflets, one at the end of the stem\r\nand two pairs lower down. These leaf stems are long and tough, and it is\r\nchiefly by them that the plant can climb as it does; they twine round\r\nany branch or twig they touch, and give the Traveller\'s Joy a firm\r\nsupport. I have seen trees in woods covered with this plant to a height\r\nof twenty feet from the ground.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn and early winter you would admire the Traveller\'s Joy as\r\nmuch as you do now. The flowers will certainly be gone, but each seed\r\nwhich takes the place of a blossom will have a little plume of silky\r\nwhite threads attached to it--a sort of feathery tail. These serve as\r\nwings by which the seeds are often carried long distances by the wind.\r\nThe seeds of some other plants which we shall see have something of the\r\nsame kind.\r\n\r\nThere is another climbing plant in the hedge, the Large Bindweed or\r\nConvolvulus. To look at it, however, we will go round into the garden\r\nwhere there is more of it than Mrs. Hammond cares to see. It is\r\ncertainly a beautiful plant, with its large three-sided pointed leaves,\r\nand its great pure white bell-shaped flowers--something like the mouth\r\nof a trumpet.\r\n\r\nIn the farmhouse garden, however, it is certainly a weed--a plant in the\r\nwrong place. We see that at once. Close to the hedge are some gooseberry\r\nand currant bushes, and into these the Bindweed has climbed. The\r\nBindweed\'s stems are twined round the stems and branches of the bushes\r\ntill they are almost hidden by it, and are bent down by the weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARGE BINDWEED.]\r\n\r\nThe Bindweed climbs, as we see, by twisting its stem round the tree to\r\nwhich it clings; but though it is a climbing plant its stems can grow\r\nfor a foot or more from the ground without support. Some of the shoots\r\nof the Bindweed are two or three feet away from the stems of the fruit\r\nbushes, but they have grown unsupported till they could reach an\r\noverhanging bough and cling to that.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, Dan, who looks after the garden when he has time,\r\ncuts oft all the Bindweed close to the ground, and pulls some of it up\r\nby the roots; but fresh shoots soon appear again. It is of little use to\r\ndig up the ground near the bushes, for the Bindweed is twisted all among\r\ntheir roots.\r\n\r\nYou think the Bindweed and the Traveller\'s Joy beautiful flowers, and\r\nso they are. At the same time these plants are far more troublesome and\r\ndangerous weeds than the Stinging Nettle. Nearly all plants that cling\r\nto other plants do harm; they prevent the stems and boughs to which they\r\ncling from swelling freely. See how tightly the Bindweed stems are\r\ntwisted round the boughs of this currant bush. Ivy, Bindweed, and other\r\nclinging plants often kill or seriously injure valuable trees in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCLOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nI said all I could to make you admire the Nettle, and to see what a\r\nhandsome and even useful plant it is. I am afraid, however, that you do\r\nnot care much for it; I do not see that any of you have gathered a\r\nhandful to take home. When we go in to dinner presently, if Mrs. Hammond\r\nwere to say, "Will you have green peas or nettle-tops?" I believe you\r\nwould all say, "Peas, if you please!" So we had better look for a flower\r\nthat you may like better. We will go to Ashmead, where the cows are\r\ngrazing, and will find some Clover.\r\n\r\nMr. Hammond grows Clover in some of his fields every year. Those of you\r\nwho have been at Willow Farm before, and have walked about the farmer\'s\r\nfields, know this, for we saw the bailiff sowing Clover broadcast.\r\nBesides the fields of Clover, however, there is always plenty of it\r\ngrowing among the meadow grass. We find some directly we go through the\r\ngate into Ashmead. It is a plant with a bright purplish-red blossom.\r\nLet us sit down and examine it carefully.\r\n\r\nThe blossom is a little knob, or ball of colour, almost round. It is\r\nmade up of a great many little purple stalks, standing upright and very\r\nclose together. Pull a few of these stalks from the blossom and put\r\ntheir lower ends between your lips. They are quite sweet like sugar.\r\nNearly all flowers contain honey, or rather _nectar_ of which the bees\r\nmake honey. Some flowers have much nectar, some less, and some have none\r\nat all; the Clover contains a great deal.\r\n\r\nNow look at the leaves; each has three leaflets. If you can find a leaf\r\nwith four of these leaflets, the country children will think you very\r\nfortunate, for a four-leaved Clover is said to bring good luck, just\r\nas a four-leaved Shamrock does in Ireland. A four-leaved Clover is,\r\nhowever, rather rare; I hope you may find one, but I am rather afraid\r\nyou will not.\r\n\r\nHere is another Clover, not quite so handsome as the Red Clover at\r\nwhich we have just been looking; the flowers are white, and are rather\r\nsmaller. This is White or Dutch Clover. It is a perennial plant, and one\r\nwhich spreads over a great deal of ground if it is allowed to do so.\r\nWe saw, you remember, that the ivy-leaved Toadflax on the wall by the\r\nfoldyard steps sent out fresh roots from its stems as it grew. The White\r\nClover does the same. The stems creep along the ground, send out fresh\r\nroots, and in this way the plant spreads quickly.\r\n\r\nKeeping a few stems of both these clovers in our hands we will go a\r\nlittle further up the lane. There, in a field, we shall see something\r\nthat even country people cannot see every day. The Clover which farmers\r\nusually sow is either the Red Clover or the White, or else another kind\r\ncalled Alsike. This year Mr. Hammond has sown a field with a fourth\r\nkind--Crimson Clover.\r\n\r\nDid you ever see a more beautiful sight? The whole field is a blaze of\r\nrich crimson colour. I shall never forget the day I first saw a field\r\nof Crimson Clover. I was so delighted that I asked the farmer--not Mr.\r\nHammond, but another friend--if he would have a field of it for me to\r\nadmire every year! He said he would tell me by and by. At the end of the\r\nyear he said he did not find it such a useful food for his animals as\r\nthe Red and White Clovers, and he should not sow it again--at least not\r\nvery soon. You see pretty things are not always the most useful.\r\n\r\nLet us see what differences we can find between the three clovers we\r\nhave gathered. We look first at the blossoms. That of the Red Clover is,\r\nas we have said, like a little round ball, or knob. The flower of the\r\nWhite Clover is of much the same shape, but is less fine. The flower of\r\nthe Crimson Clover is altogether different in shape. It has indeed many\r\nsmall crimson stems, but these do not form a round ball. They are\r\narranged in the form of a little circular cone or pyramid which is large\r\nat the bottom and pointed at the top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOVER LEAVES. 1. White; 2. Crimson; 3. Red.]\r\n\r\nThere are other differences. Immediately below the flower of the Red\r\nClover is a pair of leaves; the blossom is said to be "sessile" or\r\nseated on these leaves. Other leaves, and also other blossoms, grow\r\non the same stem. Now look at the White Clover. The blossom grows on\r\na stalk without any leaves or other blossoms on it--only the single\r\nblossom at the top of the stalk. The blossom of the Crimson Clover has\r\nleaves below it.\r\n\r\nTo-day we easily distinguish one clover from the others by the flowers.\r\nSupposing, however, that we looked at them some day before the flowers\r\nwere out; what then? Are there any differences in the leaves? All three\r\nhave leaves formed of three leaflets--they are trefoils--but the leaves\r\nare otherwise different.\r\n\r\nThose of the Red Clover grow on stems branching from the flower stem,\r\nand sometimes on the flower stem itself. Both leaves and stems are\r\nhairy, and on the leaves there is generally a white mark, something the\r\nshape of a horseshoe.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the White Clover grow, like the flower, at the top of the\r\nstem--a single leaf on each stem. The under sides of the leaves are\r\nsmooth and glossy. The leaves of the Crimson Clover grow on the flower\r\nstems like those of the Red Clover; but the leaflets are broader and\r\nrounder than the Red Clover leaflets. The Crimson Clover is an annual,\r\nwhile the others are perennials.\r\n\r\nAll these clovers are good food for the farmer\'s animals or stock. The\r\nRed Clover is, perhaps, the most useful. Bees, however, prefer the White\r\nClover, for they can more easily get at its nectar.\r\n\r\nSheep are exceedingly fond of Clover, but Mr. Hammond is always careful\r\nnot to turn them into a field of Clover when they are very hungry,\r\nor to let them stray in by accident. If they got in they would eat it\r\nravenously, and many would very likely die. Too hearty a meal of Clover\r\nhas the same effect on them as a great quantity of new bread would have\r\non you or me.\r\n\r\nWe have spent so much time this morning looking at the clovers that we\r\nhave only a minute or two to stand at the gate of a field of beans. The\r\nblossoms are pretty--white with dark spots--and they are very fragrant.\r\nA field of beans in flower gives us one of the most delightful of all\r\ncountry scents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nIN "ASHMEAD"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many other flowers besides the Clover in Ashmead to-day, and\r\nthis afternoon we will look at some that grow among the grass. One of\r\nthese you may perhaps call a weed, yet it is one of the most beautiful\r\nwild flowers in England. I mean the golden Dandelion.\r\n\r\nOn a lawn or in a garden bed it would certainly be a weed, and a very\r\ntroublesome one. Here among the grass we need only think of it as a very\r\nlovely flower. See what a rich golden yellow the little florets of the\r\nblossom are. Plants like the Dandelion, in which the blossom is composed\r\nof a number of florets, are called "composite" plants.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the plant closely we shall find that each stalk which\r\nbears a blossom, and each long deeply indented leaf, grows, like the\r\nflower-stem and leaf of the Primrose, from a very short underground\r\nstem. It is from the indented leaves that the Dandelion gets its name.\r\nThe leaves have something the appearance of the teeth of a lion. Now\r\nthe French name for lion\'s tooth is _dent de lion_, and we English have\r\ncorrupted this into _dandelion._\r\n\r\nEach flower-stem is round and, when we pull one, we see that it is a\r\nhollow tube. We bite a piece of the stalk as we did with the Clover\r\nblossom. What a difference! The Clover was quite sweet, but the\r\nDandelion is very bitter. You may not like the taste perhaps, but the\r\nwhite milky-looking juice is quite wholesome. Dandelion tea and\r\nDandelion beer are often made by country people, and the leaves give a\r\npleasant flavour to a salad.\r\n\r\nShall we pull up a plant and examine the root? I am afraid we cannot,\r\nunless you care to go back to the house for a fork or a trowel. The\r\nDandelion has a very long strong root--tap-root--which goes deep into\r\nthe ground; and there is no tall main stem of which we can take\r\nhold--the leaves and flower stalks only break off in our hands.\r\n\r\nHere is a stalk from which the flower has fallen, leaving only the seed.\r\nOf what does it remind you? Of the Traveller\'s Joy in autumn? Yes; the\r\nDandelion has what is called a "pappus" attached to its seed, rather\r\nsimilar to the feathery tail of the Traveller\'s Joy. This makes the\r\nDandelion a troublesome weed; the seeds are easily carried by the wind\r\nand, if a patch of dandelions is allowed to go to seed, it will produce\r\nfresh plants quite far away. Before the seeds are scattered each head is\r\nlike a round white fluffy ball.\r\n\r\nHere are daisies, with their dainty white florets often tinged with\r\npink. In the centre of each blossom is a yellow spot. Every night the\r\nwhite florets fold up over the yellow centre, and do not open until the\r\nmorning. This fact explains to us the Daisy\'s name; it is the Day\'s Eye\r\nwhich opens at dawn and shuts at night.\r\n\r\nThe Daisy is a little flower which everyone knows and loves, yet in the\r\nwrong place it is a weed. It is a perennial and it spreads very fast. Of\r\ncourse both perennials and annuals spread by means of their seed, but\r\nperennials also spread in other ways as well. We will see how the Daisy\r\ndoes this.\r\n\r\nThere; with my pocket knife I have easily dug up a plant. The root is\r\nsmall and compact, not long like that of the Dandelion. But, when I try\r\nto lift the Daisy plant from the grass, I find that it is still held\r\ndown by a stout tough thread branching from the root. This thread is\r\nconnected with another Daisy plant; from that one there is another\r\nthread connected with a third plant. When we have at last got our plant\r\nclear away from the ground, three more are hanging to it by these\r\nthreads.\r\n\r\nThat is how the Daisy spreads; it throws out these thread-like shoots\r\nfrom the root, and from these grow another root and plant. I knew only\r\ntoo well what we should find; there are far too many daisies in my lawn\r\nat home, and I found out long ago the way in which they spread so fast.\r\nIf daisies are allowed to increase in this way they form large clumps\r\nwhich smother and kill the grass. We notice that each flower-stem and\r\neach leaf of the Daisy springs from a very short underground stem, as\r\nthose of the Dandelion do.\r\n\r\nDaisies and dandelions are plentiful in Ashmead, and so are the yellow\r\nbuttercups. There are, however, not quite so many buttercups as you\r\nmight think at first. The real name of what we call the Buttercup is the\r\nBulbous Crowfoot, and there is also a Meadow Crowfoot in the field. A\r\nthird crowfoot is the Corn Crowfoot. To-day we will notice one or two\r\ndifferences between the two plants we see here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULBOUS CROWFOOT.]\r\n\r\nThe blossoms of both plants have five smooth shining yellow petals.\r\nWe see, however, that those of the Bulbous Crowfoot or Buttercup form\r\na real cup, while the petals of the Meadow Crowfoot spread out almost\r\nflat. The Meadow Crowfoot grows two or three feet high; the Buttercup\r\nis a shorter plant.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are pretty, but that, I am afraid, is all that we can\r\nsay for either of these plants. They are both of them bitter and\r\nunwholesome, and horses and cattle avoid eating them. Some people even\r\nsay that to carry a bunch of the stems will make the hands sore; so I\r\nthink that we will only look at and admire the flowers where they grow.\r\n\r\nThe Cowslip is a very different plant indeed and we will not call it a\r\nweed. Even Mr. Hammond is not sorry to see it here; for he is fond of a\r\nglass of the sweet cowslip wine which Mrs. Hammond will make if we busy\r\nourselves and take home some large basketfuls of the drooping blossoms.\r\nBefore we set to work, however, let us examine the plant.\r\n\r\nLooking at a stalk of Cowslip blossoms we see something peculiar about\r\nit at once--something unlike the other flowers we have seen. Six or\r\nseven drooping blossoms grow from the stalk we have picked, and they\r\nall grow from the very top of the stalk. The point at the top of the\r\nstalk from which the blossoms grow is called the "umbel."\r\n\r\nEach blossom has five yellow petals joined together to form a corolla.\r\nIn the centre of the blossom, where these petals meet, each is marked\r\nwith a spot of deep orange-red colour. The yellow petals are\r\ncomparatively small, and peep out of a long pale green sheath called\r\nthe "calyx."\r\n\r\nSurely we have seen a flower like this before--the Primrose in the\r\nlittle coppice. Yes; the Primrose had five pale yellow petals, rather\r\nlarger than those of the Cowslip, and joined together to form a corolla;\r\nthey grew out of a long green calyx. Also each petal had a spot of\r\ndarker yellow in the centre of the blossom. The leaves of both the\r\nPrimrose and the Cowslip are much wrinkled, and they grow from a short\r\nunderground stem.\r\n\r\nBut, you say, each Primrose blossom grew alone on the top of a long\r\nstem. Yes, but if we had dug up a Primrose plant, we should have found\r\nthat several flower stems grew from the same point--the top of a very\r\nshort stem which hardly appeared above the ground. They grew from an\r\numbel, and the Primrose is closely related to the Cowslip. The\r\ndifference is that the blossoms of the Primrose grow on _long_ stems\r\nfrom a _short_-stemmed umbel. Those of the Cowslip grow on _short_ stems\r\nfrom a _long_-stemmed umbel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nIN THE HAY-FIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we are in the hay-field at the end of June. It is not really the\r\nhay-field yet, but it will be so as soon as the grass is cut for hay.\r\nThis will be done in a few days, so we must lose no time if we wish to\r\nlook at some of the flowers before they are cut down.\r\n\r\nWe must not stroll all over this field as we did in Ashmead, for the\r\nlong grass should not be trampled down, or it will be difficult for the\r\nmachine to cut. Quite near the gate, however, are plenty of flowers, and\r\nwe shall find others if we step carefully along the side of the hedge.\r\n\r\nWe will look first at those flowers which are most important to the\r\nfarmer, the flowers of the grass. We saw, you remember, that the grass\r\nhas flowers just as the Rose and the Wallflower have. If you had thought\r\nthat the flowers of all grass would be alike, you see now that you were\r\nquite mistaken; there are many different grass flowers here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF GRASS STEM.]\r\n\r\nNot only are the flowers different, but so are the stems, and also the\r\nleaves or blades. Mr. Hammond could come into the field in early spring\r\nor autumn, when the grass is not in flower, and could tell you to which\r\nkind of grass any blade belonged. To-day we shall easily distinguish the\r\ndifferent kinds of grasses by their flowers, though we will also notice\r\ndifferences in their stems and leaves.\r\n\r\nLet us pick a stem or culm of grass. We see that the greater part of it\r\nis hollow; but at intervals there are joints, and here the stem is\r\nsolid. From each joint grows a leaf-sheath which is wrapped round the\r\nstem for a little distance above the joint. Out of each sheath grows a\r\nleaf. All grass leaves are long and narrow compared with those of most\r\nother plants, but some grass leaves are longer and narrower than others.\r\n\r\nNow for a flower. The stem which we have picked is the stem of perennial\r\nRye Grass. The blossom, we see, consists of several small spikelets;\r\nthere are eighteen on our stem. They grow alternately on two opposite\r\nsides of the stem, first one on one side, then one on the other. They\r\nhave no stalk of their own; they are sessile or seated on the stem. As\r\nthe spikelets are flat and grow on two sides of the stem only, each stem\r\nlooks as if it had been pressed in a book, as perhaps you have sometimes\r\npressed flowers.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are dark green, glossy and shining. On the under side of each\r\nleaf there is a prominent rib which extends the whole length. This rib\r\nis one of the signs by which Mr. Hammond can tell a blade of Rye Grass\r\nat once without seeing the flower.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the farmer\'s most useful grasses. It forms a close thick\r\ncarpet or sward, and, the more it is trodden on by animals grazing, the\r\nbetter it seems to thrive.\r\n\r\nHere is another excellent grass, with a flower quite different in\r\nappearance from the last. It is called Timothy Grass. It was first\r\ncultivated in America by a man named Timothy Hanson, and it is now\r\nalways known by his Christian name. Mr. Hammond knows this, and now you\r\nknow it too; but a good many farmers who have plenty of Timothy Grass in\r\ntheir fields do not know the reason of its name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COWSLIP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HONEYSUCKLE AND WILD ROSE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRASSES. 1. Cocksfoot; 2. Sweet vernal; 3. Meadow\r\nfoxtail; 4. Common Timothy; 5. Tufted hair; 6. Common rye grass.]\r\n\r\nThe spikelets of Timothy are very small and grow in dense clusters at\r\nthe end of the stem, so that the blossom forms a kind of tail. Indeed\r\nTimothy is sometimes called Meadow Catstail, a name which gives a very\r\ngood idea of its appearance. This cluster or tail of spikelets is green\r\nand also rather rough to the touch. Notice these two points about it; we\r\nshall see the reason presently. The green leaves have a greyish tint and\r\nare broader than many grass leaves. When cut and made into hay, the\r\nleaves are rather stiff and hard.\r\n\r\nTimothy grows in good thick clumps, but does not make a very spreading\r\nsward. Moist weather suits it best, though it can stand a dry summer\r\nfairly well. It is a late grass. Other grasses in the field are in full\r\nflower to-day, but there are only a few ears of Timothy to be seen; its\r\nflowering-time is July. In one way it is a valuable grass for hay; it is\r\nheavy, and hay is always sold by weight. On the other hand Timothy hay\r\nis rather hard.\r\n\r\nNow here is a grass something like Timothy, yet different in several\r\nways. It is Meadow Foxtail. The ear formed by the cluster of spikelets\r\nis of the same shape as an ear of Timothy, like a round tail slightly\r\npointed. But the ear of Timothy was green, while this is a beautiful\r\nsilvery grey. Timothy was rough; the ear of Meadow Foxtail is very soft\r\nand silky to the touch. The silkiness and the silvery grey colour are\r\ngiven to the ear by a soft hair called the "awn" which grows from each\r\nspikelet. The leaves are broad and juicy, and there are many of them.\r\n\r\nMeadow Foxtail, unlike Timothy, is an early grass; you may find it\r\nin flower in April. An early grass is always valuable to the farmer,\r\nwho wants herbage for his sheep and cattle after the long winter.\r\nThe Foxtail, moreover, is a spreading grass. Some of its stems are\r\nprostrate; they do not stand upright but creep along the ground. From\r\nthese prostrate stems fresh roots grow and produce fresh plants. Thus\r\nMeadow Foxtail makes a good sward.\r\n\r\nAnother useful grass is Cocksfoot. Each culm has four or five thick\r\nclusters of spikelets growing on small stalks of their own. The clusters\r\ngrow from the culm in a way which reminds us of the claw of a fowl; that\r\nis the reason of the name. Cocksfoot is a tall and quick growing plant,\r\nand both the stem and flower feel rough and hard. The blue-green leaves\r\nare very juicy. The root goes deep into the soil, so that this grass\r\nresists drought well.\r\n\r\nWe must notice the Sweet Vernal Grass, though there is not much of it in\r\nthe field; for this grass, when it is dry, gives out much of the sweet\r\nscent we smell in or near a hay-field. If we chew a stalk, we notice the\r\nscent ourselves, and animals like the pleasant flavour which it gives to\r\nhay. Though it is an early grass it also lasts till late in the autumn.\r\nThe spikelets make a cluster or tail at the end of the stalk, but they\r\ndo not grow so closely together as those of the Timothy and Meadow\r\nFoxtail.\r\n\r\nLook at this Tufted Hair Grass. It is very pretty, perhaps one of the\r\nprettiest grasses we have seen; but the farmer looks upon it as a weed.\r\nIt has a large and spreading head of flower; the spikelets grow on\r\nstems, and become gradually smaller towards the top of the stalk. The\r\nflower is purple, with a shining silvery light upon it. It grows in\r\nthick clumps or tussocks, and cattle do not care about the leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nIN THE HAY-FIELD (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many other grasses in the field; some of them are useful,\r\nwhile others the farmer would call weeds. We must now look at other\r\nflowers, and, as the grass is so tall, it will be better to choose tall\r\nflowers which can easily be seen. We soon spy a Thistle among the grass\r\nnear the gate.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of Thistle in England--the Milk Thistle, the\r\nNodding Thistle, and some others. This is the common Field Thistle. It\r\nis far too common to please Mr. Hammond or any other careful farmer. It\r\nis true that it is only an annual; but, like the Dandelion, it has a\r\npappus attached to its seed. However hard Mr. Hammond tries to get rid\r\nof thistles from his fields, fresh seeds are constantly blown into them\r\nfrom thistles on the road-side banks, or in the fields of farmers not so\r\ncareful as himself. It is very disheartening to a good farmer to have\r\ncareless neighbours. When Mr. Hammond hears that a new tenant is coming\r\nto a neighbouring farm, he always hopes that he will be a "clean"\r\nfarmer--that he will try to keep his fields free from weeds.\r\n\r\nThe stiff stem of the Thistle is often three or four feet tall, and\r\ndivides into smaller branches which bear a flower at the end. These\r\nflowers are a little like those of the Red Clover; each blossom has many\r\nsmall upright florets, purplish-red in colour. The leaves are not very\r\ntempting to touch, but they are very interesting. They are divided into\r\nseveral lobes or divisions, and each lobe ends in a sharp point. They\r\nhave no leaf stem to connect them with the stalk of the plant. What is\r\ncurious about them is that they do not grow from a small point on the\r\nstalk. They are "decurrent," or running along the stalk; a broad strip\r\nat the base of each leaf is attached to the stalk.\r\n\r\nDocks too are far too numerous among the grass. They are very\r\ntroublesome weeds; they are perennials, and they also scatter a great\r\ndeal of seed. They have large clusters of small flowers without any true\r\npetals. The leaves are very large and pointed, growing on long leaf\r\nstems. The stems of the Dock are tough, and they blunt the mowers\'\r\nscythes and the knives of the mowing-machine.\r\n\r\nSome people have a good word even for the Dock. They say that a Dock\r\nleaf wrapped round the part stung by a nettle will lessen the pain;\r\nothers advise us to rub the part with Dock _seed._ I do not think myself\r\nthat either remedy has much effect; but the leaves of the Sorrel, which\r\nis a relative of the Dock, _will_ lessen the pain of nettle stings. Mrs.\r\nHammond always uses Dock leaves to wrap round the pats of butter which\r\nshe sends to market.\r\n\r\nAbove us, in the hedge, are two of the sweetest flowers of the farm. The\r\npink Dog Rose is one. The petals of each blossom are five in\r\nnumber--what a number of five-petalled flowers we have seen! The leaves\r\nhave five, or sometimes seven, serrated leaflets, one of which is always\r\nat the end of the leaf stem. These leaflets are not always perfectly\r\nstraight; sometimes the pointed end turns a good deal to one side.\r\n\r\nOf course we want to gather some of the flowers--who does not want to\r\ngather Roses? We want some fully opened blossoms and many of the dainty\r\nbuds. But the straggling stems of the Rose soon teach us the truth of\r\nthe proverb: "No Rose without a Thorn." The stems are thickly covered\r\nwith thorns; these are not only sharp, but hooked as well, and we do not\r\nget our bunch of roses without a scratch or two.\r\n\r\nThe other beauty of the hedge is the Honey-suckle--a lovely flower which\r\nmay also be a dangerous weed. The tight grasp of its strong twining stem\r\nwill soon seriously injure any young tree to which it clings. Here it is\r\ndoing little harm, and we need only think of the clusters of fragrant\r\nflowers. Each cluster grows at the end of a stalk. Some are pale pink,\r\nothers golden yellow, while some are almost white. After the blossom\r\ncomes the bright red berry which contains the seed. The leaves grow in\r\npairs. Those low down on the stem have leaf stalks, but the upper ones\r\nare sessile on the stem.\r\n\r\nTaking care not to trample the grass, we have strolled down the\r\nhedge-side till we have reached the other end of the field, where there\r\nis a ditch. At once there is a fragrant scent in the air--a scent like\r\nthat of almonds. It is the Meadow Sweet which grows on the banks of\r\nstreams or damp ditches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEADOW SWEET.]\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful plant, as well as a fragrant one. At the top of the\r\ntall stems are large clusters of small five-petalled flowers,\r\ncreamy-white. The stem itself is handsome; it is often three or four\r\nfeet high, smooth, stout, and of a reddish colour. The large leaves grow\r\nalternately on the stem; they are made up of several pairs of leaflets\r\nwith a single leaflet at the end. The upper surface of the leaves is\r\ndark green, but the under side is generally covered with a soft white\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe scent of Meadow Sweet is very pleasant in the field to-day, but I\r\nthink we should find it rather too strong if we took a bunch into the\r\nhouse. Yet Queen Elizabeth is said to have loved Meadow Sweet strewn on\r\nthe floors of her apartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nIN THE CORN-FIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning early in July, while we are having breakfast at Willow Farm,\r\nwe ask Mr. Hammond if he thinks we shall find any flowers in his\r\nwheat-field. The farmer laughs and says he hopes we shall not, but he is\r\nvery much afraid that we shall. As we are here on purpose to look for\r\nflowers we are glad to find them anywhere. Mr. Hammond thinks more about\r\nhis crops than about flowers, and does not care to see a single blossom\r\nin his corn, however pretty it may be.\r\n\r\nWe are soon at the field, and there is no mistake about the flowers\r\nbeing there too. Close to the gate, where the wheat is not quite so\r\nthick as elsewhere, there is a splendid patch of scarlet poppies. This\r\nis perhaps the very brightest wild flower that we have.\r\n\r\nSome plants, as we have seen, are annuals, others are perennials. An\r\nannual only lives for one year. The plant springs up from the seed,\r\ngrows through the summer, and in the autumn or the winter dies. A\r\nperennial lives for many years. The flowers fade and fall as those of\r\nannuals do; even the leaves and stems may droop and die. The roots and\r\nlower part of the stem do not die; they live in the ground through the\r\nwinter, and in the following year fresh stems appear. The White Clover\r\nwhich we found in Ashmead is a perennial, the Crimson Clover is an\r\nannual.\r\n\r\nIf you sowed a patch of your garden with Poppy seed you would have the\r\nflowers growing there year after year. You might therefore say, "Surely\r\nthe Poppy is a perennial. I only sowed the seed one year, yet the\r\npoppies appear again and again." That is because the plants sowed their\r\nown seed. The flowers faded; then the seed-cases shed their seed upon\r\nthe ground. Next spring the seeds produced fresh plants. Most annual\r\nwild flowers sow their own seed in this way, but we must not mistake\r\nthem for perennials because year after year they grow in the same place.\r\n\r\nIn your patch of garden you can easily prevent the poppies from growing\r\nmore than one year if you wish to do so. All that is necessary is to\r\npick off every flower before it fades. Then no seed will fall and you\r\nwill be rid of the poppies.\r\n\r\nMr. Hammond might do the same, you think, if he wishes to rid his field\r\nof poppies. But you see there are many poppies growing among the wheat\r\nall through the field. To get at each plant and cut off all the flowers\r\nwould trample down the wheat and do more harm than good. All that the\r\nfarmer can do is to have as many weeds as possible hoed up while the\r\nwheat is young and short. Even then many more come up later in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the Poppy have no pappus like those of the Thistle and some\r\nother plants; they are not blown far away by the wind, but fall close to\r\nthe plant. There are, however, an immense number of very tiny seeds in\r\neach seed-case, as we see by opening the round cup-like case on a stem\r\nfrom which the flower has fallen. This great number of seeds adds to the\r\ndifficulty of getting rid of poppies.\r\n\r\nWe, I am afraid, are hardly sorry that the poppies are among the corn\r\nto-day. The glorious scarlet blossoms give a rich fiery tint to the\r\nwhole field.\r\n\r\nOn a Poppy plant close to the gate there are several blossoms. Some\r\nof them are fully open, some of them are still only buds. You see a\r\ndifference between the open flowers and the buds at once. The open\r\nflowers stand upright on the stalk; the buds hang down.\r\n\r\nHere is a bud just opening. The green case, called the calyx, which\r\ncontains the scarlet petals, is already partly open; it is splitting in\r\nhalf, and the flower will soon be out. Then the calyx will fall off.\r\n\r\nHere is a blossom from which the calyx has just dropped. The four large\r\nscarlet petals, two of which are slightly larger than the other two,\r\nhave lain inside all crumpled up--not neatly folded as is the case with\r\nmost flowers. Yet in a very short time after the calyx has dropped off,\r\nthe sap will flow into the petals and will smooth them out. They will be\r\nas glossy, smooth, and shining as the other blossoms fully open on the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant Poppy is more beautiful than useful--to the farmer and the\r\nbees at any rate. Most flowers contain nectar, but the Poppy has none at\r\nall. If the bees come to it, it is for the dusty yellow pollen to make\r\ninto wax.\r\n\r\nThe seed pods of some flowers open when ripe, and the seeds fall out.\r\nIn others the pod or case does not open but rots away. The Poppy has a\r\ndifferent way of scattering its seed. There is a ring of tiny holes in\r\nthe seed case, and through these holes the seed is shaken out. The\r\nleaves are long, but vary a good deal in size and shape. The stems are\r\ncovered with stiff and bristly hairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nIN THE CORN-FIELD (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the poppies there is Charlock in the field; not much, Mr.\r\nHammond will be glad to know, for he has been trying for many years to\r\nget rid of this plant altogether. Pretty as the yellow blossoms of the\r\nCharlock are, it is one of the most troublesome weeds which the farmer\r\nhas to fight. It is only an annual certainly, and each seed-pod holds no\r\nmore than six or seven seeds. The seeds, however, are oily, and this\r\noiliness preserves them. If they are ploughed deep into the ground, they\r\nmay live there for several years, and will produce a plant when turned\r\nup again by the plough or the scuffle.\r\n\r\nMr. Hammond tells me that some years ago this field was full of\r\nCharlock, and in the early summer there would be more Charlock than\r\nwheat to be seen. This is how he got rid of it. Every year he ploughed\r\nthe field and got it ready for the crop as early as possible. Then the\r\nCharlock sprang up before the crop of corn or turnips was sown; thus it\r\ncould be rooted out. Still, as we see to-day, there is a little left,\r\nthough it is growing less each year.\r\n\r\nCharlock is wild mustard. There is more seed than blossom here to-day,\r\nfor the flowering time for Charlock is in June. If we chew some seed\r\nfrom a pod, we shall find it hot and biting to the tongue. In some parts\r\nof England many farmers grow mustard as one of their crops.\r\n\r\nNear Willow Farm some farmers grow mustard as a catch-crop. They sow it\r\nin autumn, as soon as another crop has been taken off the field. In the\r\nspring it is eaten by sheep, or else it is ploughed in. A catch-crop\r\nploughed in like this enriches the land. Moreover a number of weeds are\r\nburied with the catch-crop before they have time to blossom and to shed\r\ntheir seed.\r\n\r\nThe yellow blossom of the Charlock is pretty, and the Poppy is the\r\nfinest scarlet wild flower we have. There is a third flower among the\r\nwheat to-day, the beautiful blue Corn Flower or Corn Bluebottle. It is\r\nno more welcome to the farmer than the Poppy and the Charlock are. It is\r\na perennial, and therefore difficult to get rid of. Moreover when we\r\npull up a stem we find it quite hard work, it is so tough. These tough\r\nstems blunt the sickles of the reapers and the knives of the reaping\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration left: CREEPING FIELD THISTLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration right: FIELD SCABIOUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration left: EVERGREEN ALKANET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration center: CORNFLOWER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration right: SMALLER BINDWEED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLOCK.]\r\n\r\nTo us it is only a very beautiful flower. The florets in the centre of\r\neach blossom are dark purple, but the outer ones are of a brighter blue.\r\nThe leaves are long and narrow; those near the bottom of the stem are\r\nrather broader than those higher up. The stems themselves are not round,\r\nbut angular. We can feel corners or angles as we hold one in our hand.\r\nThey are also covered with a kind of down.\r\n\r\nThere is another flower which we shall see better if we come to the\r\nstubble field after the wheat is cut; but some of it is near the gate\r\nto-day. This is the Smaller Bindweed. We see that it is a relation of\r\nthe Large Bindweed in the garden hedge. It has leaves and flowers of the\r\nsame shape, but the flowers are smaller, and are pink and white. Those\r\nof the Large Bindweed are rarely anything but pure white.\r\n\r\nThis is another troublesome weed here. It does not climb, as the Large\r\nBindweed does, but creeps along the ground, twining round everything it\r\nmeets. In the potato field it is often even more troublesome than here.\r\nCorn is _cut_, but potatoes are _dug_ out of the ground. The Small\r\nBindweed forms such a thick carpet over the field, and twines round the\r\npotato stems so closely, that it is often very difficult to dig up the\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\nHere is another little flower which I am glad to show you now, the\r\nScarlet Pimpernel. This and the Poppy are the only _scarlet_ wild\r\nflowers we have. There are many _pink_, and also many _purple_ flowers,\r\nbut only these two are really _scarlet_.\r\n\r\nThe Pimpernel differs from the Poppy in almost everything except its\r\ncolour. The Poppy has a tall stout stem and its blossoms are very\r\nlarge. The Pimpernel trails on the ground and has tiny flowers. The\r\nblossoms of the Poppy have four petals, those of the Pimpernel have\r\nfive. These are a beautiful scarlet, but not _quite_ so bright a scarlet\r\nas those of the Poppy.\r\n\r\nThe leaves grow in pairs, and the small bare stalks which carry a flower\r\nat their ends spring from the stem beside the leaves. The leaves are\r\nsessile on the stem. Turning a leaf over we find that on its under side\r\nare black or dark purple spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIMPERNEL.]\r\n\r\nThe blossoms of the Pimpernel close up when rain is near, and it is\r\noften called the Poor Man\'s Weatherglass. Sometimes, but very rarely, a\r\nplant is found which has pink, or even pure white blossoms. There is\r\nalso a blue Pimpernel. Another Pimpernel is the Bog Pimpernel; but we\r\nshall not find it in this dry field of corn, as you may guess by the\r\nname.\r\n\r\nOne more flower we will look at, and then it will be time to leave our\r\ncorn-field and to search elsewhere. Growing on the hedgebank at the side\r\nof the field is a pretty lilac-blue flower on a long bare stalk. It is\r\nthe Field Scabious.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms are in shape like a round ball very much flattened--like a\r\nround pincushion. There are no large petals here, as with the Poppy, but\r\na great number of small florets. Those on the outer edge of the blossom\r\nare larger than those inside. Each floret is a tiny tube or pipe.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are on separate stalks from those which bear the flowers, and\r\nthey grow in pairs. They are divided into several pairs of lobes, with a\r\nsingle lobe at the end of each leaf. Some leaves grow from that part of\r\nthe stem which is underground, and these are larger than the others, and\r\nare sometimes of a different shape. Both the leaves and the stem are\r\nhairy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nON THE CHASE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now seen a good many Flowers of the Farm; we have found them in\r\nthe coppice, on the garden wall, and in the fields. To-day we will go a\r\nlittle further off, three miles away.\r\n\r\nYou say, "Surely that is a long way off for the farmer to have a field."\r\nIt is not exactly a field. The Chase is a great open common or moor,\r\nwhich belongs to the village or parish where Willow Farm is. Nearly all\r\nthe people of the village have certain rights of pasturage on it; they\r\nmay let their horses and cattle and sheep graze there. Every now and\r\nthen Mr. Hammond sends some of his sheep to the Chase to feed there for\r\na few weeks. It is very high dry ground, and that is good for sheep.\r\n\r\nThe road runs through the middle of the great common without any hedge\r\nor fence on either side. There are horses and sheep and cattle here on\r\nthis May morning; donkeys too. All the sheep are marked, and we soon see\r\nsome which belong to Willow Farm; they are stamped on the back in large\r\nletters "W.H." for William Hammond. A farmer easily knows his own horses\r\nand cows; sheep are less easy to recognise, and are usually marked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GORSE.]\r\n\r\nOne of the flowers of the Chase we see at once. In whatever direction we\r\nlook across the common there is a perfect blaze of gold--the blossoms of\r\nthe prickly Gorse or Furze. Spring is the time to see its mass of golden\r\nyellow blossoms best; but I do not think there is a week, or even a day,\r\nin the whole year when some of the flowers are not out. Did you ever\r\nhear the saying, "Kissing is out of season when the Gorse is out of\r\nbloom." That is never!\r\n\r\nThe Gorse flowers are beautiful and their scent is sweet. As to\r\ngathering them, however, there is a terrible difficulty. The flowers\r\ngrow among long sharp spikes which cover the stems closely; you would\r\nalmost as soon gather nettles! There are very few real leaves, and they\r\nare small and not easily seen; but the thorns are beautiful to look at,\r\nif not to touch--they are such a rich dark green.\r\n\r\nNor is Gorse a useless plant. If the prickly stems are bruised or mashed\r\na little they form a fodder which animals like. Indeed, a pony near us\r\nseems to enjoy them as they are; he is tearing off and eating piece\r\nafter piece from a Gorse bush. His mouth must be less tender than ours!\r\n\r\nLater in the summer we visit the Chase again to find some flowers that\r\nwere not out in May. On our way we pass a potato field in blossom--a\r\nvery pretty sight. These blossoms are a palish purple, but sometimes the\r\npotato flowers are white.\r\n\r\nThe Hairbell is a flower which we shall now find on the Chase--a great\r\ncontrast to the stout and thorny bush of Gorse. The Hairbell\'s stem is\r\nalmost as slender as a thread, although it stands upright. Each blossom\r\nis a dainty little blue bell of five petals. White blossoms are\r\nsometimes found, but not often.\r\n\r\nThere are leaves as well as flowers on the stem. Growing from the lower\r\npart of the stem, close to the ground, we may perhaps find some broader,\r\nrounder leaves; perhaps not, however, for these lower leaves soon wither\r\nand die away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAIRBELL.]\r\n\r\nThe Hairbell loves to grow where there is fresh pure air. Here on the\r\nChase we are high up; it has been a long steep climb from Willow Farm,\r\nand we are more than five hundred feet above sea level. Far below us, a\r\nfew miles away, we see a broad river on which steamers and sailing-ships\r\nare passing up and down. Away to the west is the sea, from which a\r\nbreeze is nearly always blowing across the Chase. No wonder that the\r\nlittle Hairbell loves the spot.\r\n\r\nWe have found a yellow flower and a blue one on the Chase, and now we\r\nhave not far to look for something red. Here is a clump of Heath or\r\nLing, and not far off a patch of Heather too. We must be careful to\r\ndistinguish Heath from Heather; let us look at the Heath first.\r\n\r\nOn the Heath, as on the Hairbell, we find bell-shaped flowers; but the\r\nblossoms of the Heath are very small, and grow from a tough woody stem.\r\nThey are a reddish-purple. On little side branches growing from the\r\nstems are the very tiny leaves. The whole plant is low, bushy, and\r\nspreading.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEATH AND HEATHER.]\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the Heather are rather larger, deep crimson in colour,\r\nand grow in clusters. On the flower stems grow very small narrow leaves;\r\nthere are generally three of them together and they do not grow so\r\nthickly as the leaves of Heath. Among these leaves are some that are\r\nmade up of several leaflets.\r\n\r\nGorse, Heather, and Heath are spreading plants, and, if they were\r\nallowed to grow unchecked, they would soon smother and destroy the\r\nturf. Every few years therefore the Chase is burnt. In winter or spring\r\nboth Gorse and Heath burn easily, the fire spreading fast from one patch\r\nto another. The smoke of the burning Chase may then be seen from many\r\nmiles away.\r\n\r\nWhen the fire has burnt out, the Chase looks very black and dismal. But\r\nthe roots and underground stems of both the Heather and the Gorse are\r\nstill alive. Fresh shoots will grow, and soon the Gorse will be golden\r\nin the spring, the Heather purple in the summer, as they were before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nIN THE LANES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the last day that we can spend in looking for wild flowers at\r\nWillow Farm. Perhaps some of you already knew something about flowers\r\nbefore this visit. If so, you may have been disappointed that we have\r\nnot seen some favourite flower of your own. You may think we have\r\npassed over many flowers which deserved to be noticed.\r\n\r\nFor that matter I think _every_ wild flower deserves to be noticed; but\r\nwe certainly should not have time for all. I showed you several plants\r\ngrowing on the walls and roof, because it was interesting to see that\r\nquite beautiful flowers, such as the Wallflower and the Houseleek, could\r\ngrow with very little soil. We looked rather closely at the Clovers and\r\nat the Grasses in the hay-field, because these plants are important to\r\nthe farmer; they are part of his crops. Then, too, we noticed several\r\nweeds which do him harm.\r\n\r\nTo-day I am going to take a kind of holiday. I shall show you three\r\nflowers, not because they have much to do with the farmer, but because\r\nthey are great favourites of my own.\r\n\r\nNone of these are very common at Willow Farm, although I know where to\r\nfind each one. We will go first down the little stony lane which leads\r\nfrom near the foldyard gate to the cottages where the shepherd and the\r\nbailiff live. Here we shall find the Alkanet. It is a perennial, and it\r\nblossoms here year after year. I only know one other place in the\r\nvillage where it grows. Like some other flowers we have seen, it is not\r\nreally a native of England.\r\n\r\nIt has a very beautiful blue blossom, a little like the blossom of the\r\nForget-me-not which perhaps you know, but the flower of the Alkanet is\r\nof a deeper, richer blue. Here again, as with so many other flowers we\r\nhave seen, the blossom is formed of the five lobes of a corolla. In the\r\ncentre of each blue blossom is a small white spot.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms grow in little clusters on a short stalk, and on this stalk\r\nthere is always one pair of small leaves. The leaves on the main stems\r\nof the plant are larger; the lower leaves have stalks, but those on the\r\nupper part of the stem are sessile. The leaves are hairy, and so are the\r\nstems, which often grow two or three feet high.\r\n\r\nWe saw that the Poppy and the Pimpernel were the only two true _scarlet_\r\nwild flowers of our fields. In the same way there is only one other\r\nEnglish wild flower which has such a _deep blue_ blossom as the Alkanet.\r\nThat is the Borage; and the Borage, like the Alkanet, is not really a\r\nnative of England. For a fine golden yellow flower I do not know\r\nanything which can beat the Dandelion. If we have not seen _every_ wild\r\nflower which grows at Willow Farm, we have at any rate seen three which\r\nhave the deepest and richest colours.\r\n\r\nNow for my next favourite. This time we go to the shady lane leading\r\nfrom Willow Farm to the church; that is the only place near here where\r\nI have found the Lesser Periwinkle. There is also a Larger Periwinkle,\r\nvery similar to my favourite here, except in size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LESSER PERIWINKLE.]\r\n\r\nTo find the Periwinkle in full flower we should have to come in spring,\r\nbut, though it is July now, we shall still find a blossom here and\r\nthere, I hope. Even in winter we might do so too.\r\n\r\nThe Lesser Periwinkle has a blue flower, but the blue is a pale lilac\r\nblue. Here again the petals are really the five spreading lobes of the\r\ncorolla. There is something curious about these lobes. They are of a\r\npeculiar irregular shape that is not easy to describe; they are not\r\nexactly pointed, and they are not regular in shape. You could cut the\r\npetal of a Buttercup into two equal parts; it would be almost impossible\r\nto do this with the lobes of the Periwinkle blossom.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are dark green, glossy and pointed, and they grow in pairs.\r\nOften, however, we find two pairs of leaves growing so closely together\r\nthat they seem to grow in fours. The leaves are evergreen; they do not\r\nfade and die in autumn.\r\n\r\nSome of the Periwinkle stems are erect and are about six inches high;\r\nothers are creeping. It is only the erect stems which bear flowers; the\r\ncreeping ones are barren. They do useful work, however, for they form\r\nfresh roots, as we have seen the stalks of some other plants do. In this\r\nway the whole bank beside the lane has become covered with the pretty\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe Periwinkle is a comparatively small plant. The last flower--the\r\nFoxglove--that we shall see at Willow Farm is quite different. It is a\r\nvery tall plant. It is generally described as growing from three to five\r\nfeet high, but I have seen a stem of eight or nine feet. We shall find\r\nit growing on the hedgebank in Little Orchard, and it also often grows\r\nin woods.\r\n\r\nSome plants, as we know, are annuals, others are perennials. The\r\nFoxglove is neither; it is a biennial--that is a two years\' plant. If\r\nyou sow Foxglove seed you will have no flowers the first year, only a\r\nroot and a great bunch of leaves. In the second year tall stems which\r\nbear the flowers will appear. In the autumn after it has flowered the\r\nFoxglove generally dies, though sometimes it may live for another year,\r\nor even two. Foxgloves, of course, will reproduce themselves by seed, as\r\nannuals and perennials do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOXGLOVE.]\r\n\r\nThe Foxglove is something different from anything that we have seen as\r\nyet. The flowers grow on short flower stalks and hang down from the\r\ntall stems, a great many on each stem. Here there are no petals, but\r\nwhat we see and admire so much is the bell-shaped corolla, purple-red in\r\ncolour. This purple bell is spotted with white inside. Bell-shaped is\r\nperhaps not a very good description; the flower is more like a large\r\nthimble or the finger of a glove.\r\n\r\n"A glove for a fox--that is the meaning of the name," you perhaps say.\r\nNo, it has nothing to do with a fox. Many years ago nearly everyone\r\nbelieved in Fairies, and the Fairies were often called the Good Folk or\r\nGood People. It is they, and not the fox, who were supposed to use the\r\npurple blossoms as a glove. If you say "Folk\'s Glove" quickly, you will\r\nsee how easily it comes to sound Foxglove. So our last thought among the\r\nflowers is of the Fairies, in whose existence hardly anyone believes\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Wildflowers of the Farm, by Arthur Owens Cooke\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WILDFLOWERS OF THE FARM ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 13347.txt or 13347.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/3/3/4/13347/\r\n\r\nProduced by Bryan Ness, David Garcia and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
