It has an\r\natmosphere of its own, an atmosphere of friendliness and gaiety,\r\nparticularly appreciated by English people, who in "Merry Copenhagen"\r\nalways feel themselves at home.\r\n\r\nThe approach to this fine city from the North by the Cattegat is very\r\ncharming. Sailing through the Sound, you come upon this "Athens of the\r\nNorth" at its most impressive point, where the narrow stretch of water\r\nwhich divides Sweden and Denmark lies like a silvery blue ribbon between\r\nthe two countries, joining the Cattegat to the Baltic Sea. In summer the\r\nsparkling, blue Sound, of which the Danes are so justly proud, is alive\r\nwith traffic of all kinds. Hundreds of steamers pass to and from the\r\nNorth Sea and Baltic, carrying their passengers and freights from\r\nRussia, Germany, Finland, and Sweden, to the whole world. In olden times\r\nDenmark exacted toll from these passing ships, which the nations found\r\nirksome, but the Danes most profitable. This "Sundtold" was abolished\r\nfinally at the wish of the different nations using this "King\'s\r\nhighway," who combined to pay a large lump sum to Denmark, in order that\r\ntheir ships might sail through the Sound without this annoyance in\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nKronborg Castle, whose salute demanded this toll in olden days, still\r\nrears its stately pinnacles against the blue sky, and looking towards\r\nthe old fortress of Kj\xc3\xa4rnan, on the Swedish coast, seems to say, "Our\r\nglory is of a bygone day, and in the land of memories."\r\n\r\nElsinore, the ancient town which surrounds this castle, is well known to\r\nEnglish and American tourists as the supposed burial-place of Hamlet,\r\nthe Prince of Denmark immortalized by Shakespeare. Kronborg Castle is\r\ninteresting to us, in addition, as being the place where Anne of Denmark\r\nwas married by proxy to James I. of England. Here, also, the "Queen of\r\nTears," Caroline Matilda, sister of George III., spent some unhappy\r\nmonths in prison, gazing sadly over the Sound, waiting for the English\r\nships to come and deliver her.\r\n\r\nWe pass up the Sound viewing the luxuriant cool green beech-woods of\r\nDenmark, and the pretty fishing villages lying in the foreground. Villas\r\nwith charming gardens--their tiny rickety landing-stages, bathing sheds,\r\nand tethered boats, adding fascination to the homely scene--seem to\r\nwelcome us to this land of fairy tales and the home of Hans Andersen.\r\n\r\nThe many towers and pinnacles of Copenhagen, with the golden dome of the\r\nMarble Church, flash a welcome as we steam into the magnificent harbour\r\nof this singularly well-favoured city. Here she stands, this "Queen of\r\nthe North," as a gracious sentinel bowing acquiescence to the passing\r\nships as they glide in and out of the Baltic. The broad quays are\r\nsplendidly built, lined with fine warehouses, and present a busy scene\r\nof commercial activity. The warships lying at their moorings in the\r\nSound denote that this is the station of the fleet; here also we see the\r\ncountry\'s only fortress--the formidable bulwarks which surround the\r\nharbour.\r\n\r\nKj\xc3\xb6benhavn in Danish means "merchants\' harbour," and as early as the\r\neleventh century it was a trading centre for foreign merchants attracted\r\nby the rich supply of herrings found by the Danish fishermen in the\r\nBaltic. Bishop Absalon was the founder of the city. This warrior Bishop\r\nstrongly fortified the place, in 1167, on receiving the little\r\nsettlement from King Valdemar the Great, and had plenty to do to hold\r\nit, as it was continually harassed by pirates and the Wends. These,\r\nhowever, found the Bishop more than a match for them. His outposts would\r\ncry, "The Wends are coming!" and the Bishop would leave his preaching,\r\nhis bed, or anything else he might be doing, gather his forces together,\r\nand fight gallantly for his little stronghold. He perhaps recognized\r\nthat this might one day be the key to the Baltic, which it has since\r\nbecome.\r\n\r\nThis city, therefore, is not a new one, but bombardment and\r\nconflagrations are responsible for its modern appearance. Fortunately,\r\nsome of the handsome edifices raised during the reign of Christian IV.\r\n(1588-1648) still remain to adorn the city. This monarch was a great\r\narchitect, sailor, warrior, and King, and is one of the most striking\r\nfigures in Danish history. He was beloved by his people, and did much\r\nfor his kingdom. The buildings planned and erected during this monarch\'s\r\nreign are worthy of our admiration. The beautiful Exchange, with its\r\ncurious tower formed by four dragons standing on their heads, and\r\nentwining their tails into a dainty spire; Rosenborg Castle, with its\r\ndelicate pinnacles; the famous "Runde Taarn" (Round Tower), up whose\r\ncelebrated spiral causeway Peter the Great is said to have driven a\r\ncarriage and pair, are amongst the most noteworthy. The originality in\r\ndesign of the spires and towers of Copenhagen is quite remarkable. Vor\r\nFrelsers Kirke, or Church of Our Saviour, has an outside staircase,\r\nrunning round the outside of its spire, which leads up to a figure of\r\nour Saviour, and from this height you get a fine view of the city. The\r\ntower of the fire-station, in which the fire-hose hangs at full length;\r\nthe copper-sheathed clock and bell tower--the highest in Denmark--of the\r\nTown Hall; the Eiffel-like tower of the Zoo, are among the most\r\nsingular. In all these towers there is a beautiful blending of copper\r\nand gold, which gives a distinctive and attractive character to the\r\ncity. Other prominent features are the pretty fish-scale tiling, and the\r\ncopper and bronze roofs of many of the buildings, with their "stepped"\r\ngables. Charming, too, are the city\'s many squares and public gardens,\r\ncanals with many-masted ships making an unusual spectacle in the\r\nstreets. But, after all, it is perhaps the innate gaiety of the\r\nCopenhagener which impresses you most. You feel, indeed, that these\r\nkindly Danes are a little too content for national development; but\r\ntheir light-hearted way of viewing life makes them very pleasant\r\nfriends, and their hospitality is one of their chief characteristics.\r\nEvery lady at the head of a Danish household is an excellent cook and\r\nmanager, as well as being an agreeable and intelligent companion. The\r\nCopenhagener is a "flat" dweller, and the dining-room is the largest and\r\nmost important room in every home. The Dane thinks much of his dinner,\r\nand dinner-parties are the principal form of entertainment. They joke\r\nabout their appreciation of the good things of the table, and say, "a\r\nturkey is not a good table-bird, as it is a little too much for one\r\nDane, but not enough for two!" A very pleasant side of Copenhagen life\r\nhas sprung up from this appreciation, for the restaurants and caf\xc3\xa9s are\r\nnumerous, and cater well for their customers. While the Dane eats he\r\nmust have music, which, like the food, must be good; he is very\r\ncritical, and a good judge of both. This gay caf\xc3\xa9 and restaurant life is\r\none of the fascinations of Denmark\'s "too-large heart," as this pleasant\r\ncapital is called by its people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMERRY COPENHAGEN--II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate of Copenhagen is delightful in summer, but quite the reverse\r\nin winter. Andersen says "the north-east wind and the sunbeams fought\r\nover the \'infant Copenhagen,\' consequently the wind and the \'mud-king\'\r\nreign in winter, the sunbeams in summer, and the latter bring\r\nforgetfulness of winter\'s hardships." Certainly, when the summer comes,\r\nthe sunshine reigns supreme, and makes Copenhagen bright and pleasant\r\nfor its citizens. Then the many water-ways and canals, running up from\r\nthe sea as they do into the heart of the city, make it delightfully\r\nrefreshing on a hot day. Nyhavn, for instance, which opens out of the\r\nKongen\'s Nytorv--the fashionable centre of the town--is one of the\r\nquaintest of water-streets. The cobbled way on either side of the water,\r\nthe curious little shops with sailors\' and ships\' wares, old gabled\r\nhouses, fishing and cargo boats with their forests of masts, the little\r\npuffing motor-boats plying to and fro--all serve to make a distinctive\r\npicture. On another canal-side the fish-market is held every morning. A\r\nDanish fish-market is not a bit like other fish-markets, for the Dane\r\nmust buy his fish alive, and the canal makes this possible. The\r\nfishing-smacks line up the whole side of the quay; these have perforated\r\nwooden boat-shaped tanks dragging behind them containing the lively\r\nfish. The market-women sit on the quay, surrounded by wooden tubs, which\r\nare half-filled with water, containing the unfortunate fish. A\r\ntrestle-table, on which the fish are killed and cleaned, completes the\r\nequipment of the fish-wives. The customers scrutinize the contents of\r\nthe tub, choose a fish as best they can from the leaping, gasping\r\nmultitude, and its fate is sealed. When the market-women require more\r\nfish, the perforated tank is raised from the canal, and the fish\r\nextracted with a landing-net and deposited in their tubs. Small fish\r\nonly can be kept alive in tanks and tubs; the larger kinds, such as cod,\r\nare killed and sold in the ordinary way. This market is not at all a\r\npleasant sight, so it is better to turn our backs on it, and pass on to\r\nthe fragrant flower-market.\r\n\r\nHere the famous Amager women expose their merchandise. This market\r\nsquare is a gay spectacle, for the Dane is fond of flowers, and the\r\nAmager wife knows how to display her bright blooms to advantage. These\r\nvendors are notable characters. They are the descendants of the Dutch\r\ngardeners brought over by Christian II. to grow fruit and vegetables for\r\nCopenhagen, and settled on the fertile island of Amager which abuts on\r\nthe city. Every morning these Amager peasants may be seen driving their\r\nladen carts across the bridge which joins their island to the mainland.\r\nThese genial, stout, but sometimes testy Amager wives have it all their\r\nown way in the market-place, and are clever in attracting and befooling\r\na customer. So it has become a saying, if you look sceptical about what\r\nyou are told, the "story-teller" will say, "Ask Amager mother!" which\r\nmeans, "Believe as much as you like." These women still wear their\r\nquaint costume: bulky petticoats, clean checked apron, shoulder-shawl,\r\nand poke-bonnets with white kerchief over them; and the merry twinkle of\r\nsatisfaction in the old face when a good bargain has been completed\r\nagainst the customer\'s inclination is quite amusing. These interesting\r\nold characters are easily irritated, and this the little Copenhageners\r\nknow full well. When stalls are being packed for departure, a naughty\r\nband of urchins will appear round the corner and call out:\r\n\r\n               "Amager mother, Amager mo\'er,\r\n               Give us carrots from your store;\r\n               You are so stout and roundabout,\r\n               Please tell us if you find the door\r\n               Too small to let you through!"\r\n\r\nThe Amager wife\'s wrath is soon roused, and she is often foolish enough\r\nto try and move her bulky proportions somewhat quicker than usual in\r\norder to catch the boys. This of course she never manages to do, for\r\nthey dart away in all directions. By this means the Amager woman gets a\r\nlittle much-needed exercise, the boys a great deal of amusement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FLOWER MARKET, COPENHAGEN.]\r\n\r\nSunday is a f\xc3\xaate-day in Copenhagen, and the Dane feels no obligation to\r\nattend a Church service before starting out on his Sunday expedition. A\r\nday of leisure means a day of pleasure to the Copenhagener. The State\r\nhelps and encourages him by having cheap fares, and good but inexpensive\r\nperformances at the theatre and places of entertainment on Sunday. Even\r\nthe poorest people manage to spare money for this periodical outing,\r\nmother and children taking their full share in the simple pleasures of\r\nthe day. The Copenhagener looks forward to this weekly entertainment,\r\nand longs for the fresh air. This is not surprising, for many homes are\r\nstuffy, ventilation and open windows not seeming a necessity. A fine\r\nsummer Sunday morning sees a leisurely stream of people--the Danes never\r\nhurry themselves--making for tram, train, or motor-boat, which will\r\ncarry them off to the beautiful woods and shores lying beyond the city.\r\nBasking in the sunshine, or enjoying a stroll through the woods,\r\nfeasting on the contents of their picnic baskets, with a cup of coffee\r\nor glass of pilsener at a caf\xc3\xa9 where music is always going on, they\r\nspend a thoroughly happy day. In the evening the tired but still joyous\r\nthrong return home, all the better for the simple and pleasant outing.\r\nNo country uses the bicycle more than Denmark, and Sunday is the day\r\nwhen it is used most. For the people who prefer to take their dinner at\r\nhome on Sunday there is the pleasant stroll along the celebrated\r\nLangelinie. This famous promenade, made upon the old ramparts,\r\noverlooks the Sound with its innumerable yachts skimming over the blue\r\nwater, and is a delightful place for pedestrians. A walk round the moat\r\nof the Citadel, on the waters of which the children sail their little\r\nboats, is also enjoyable. This Citadel, now used as barracks, was built\r\nby Frederik III. in 1663, and formerly served as a political prison.\r\nStruensee, the notorious Prime Minister, was imprisoned here and\r\nbeheaded for treason. A few narrow, picturesque streets surrounding this\r\nfort are all that remain of old Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nThe art treasures contained in the museums of Copenhagen being renowned,\r\nI must tell you a little about them. Two or three of the palaces not now\r\nrequired by the Royal Family are used to store some of these treasures.\r\nRosenborg Castle, built by Christian IV., and in which he died, contains\r\na collection of family treasures belonging to the Oldenburg dynasty.\r\nThis historical collection of these art-loving Kings is always open to\r\nthe public. Besides Thorvaldsen\'s Museum, which contains the greater\r\nportion of his works, there is the Carlsberg Glyptotek, which contains\r\nthe most beautiful sculpture of the French School outside France. The\r\nDanish Folk-Museum is another interesting collection. This illustrates\r\nthe life and customs of citizens and peasants from the seventeenth\r\ncentury to the present day, partly by single objects, and partly by\r\nrepresentations of their dwellings. The "Kunstmus\xc3\xa6et" contains a superb\r\ncollection of pictures, sculpture, engravings, and national relics.\r\nHere a table may be seen which formerly stood in Christian II.\'s prison.\r\nHistory tells how the unhappy King was wont to pace round this table for\r\nhours taking his daily exercise, leaning upon his hand, which in time\r\nploughed a groove in its hard surface. The Amalienborg, a fine\r\ntessellated square, contains four Royal palaces, in one of which our\r\nQueen Alexandra spent her girlhood. From the windows of these palaces\r\nthe daily spectacle of changing the guard is witnessed by the King and\r\nyoung Princes.\r\n\r\nCopenhagen is celebrated for its palaces, its parks, porcelain,\r\nstatuary, art-treasures, and last, but not least, its gaiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN, THE "FAIRY TALE" OF HIS LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose the Dane best known to English boys and girls is Hans\r\nChristian Andersen, whose charming fairy-tales are well known and loved\r\nby them all. Most of you, however, know little about his life, but are\r\ninterested enough in him, I dare say, to wish to learn more, especially\r\nas the knowledge will give you keener delight--if that is possible--in\r\nreading the works of this "Prince of Story-tellers."\r\n\r\nAndersen himself said: "My life has been so wonderful and so like a\r\nfairy-tale, that I think I had a fairy godmother who granted my every\r\nwish, for if I had chosen my own life\'s way, I could not have chosen\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\nHans C. Andersen was the son of a poor shoemaker, an only child, born in\r\nOdense, the capital of the Island of Funen. His parents were devoted to\r\nhim, and his father, who was of a studious turn of mind, delighted in\r\nteaching his little son and interesting him in Nature. Very early in\r\nlife Hans was taken for long Sunday rambles, his father pointing out to\r\nhim the beauties of woods and meadows, or enchanting him with stories\r\nfrom the "Arabian Nights."\r\n\r\nAt home the evenings were spent in dressing puppets for his favourite\r\nshow, or else, sitting on his father\'s knee, he listened while the\r\nlatter read aloud to his mother scenes from Holberg\'s plays. All day\r\nHans played with his puppet theatre, and soon began to imagine plays and\r\ncharacters for the dolls, writing out programmes for them as soon as he\r\nwas able. Occasionally his grandmother would come and take the child to\r\nplay in the garden of the big house where she lived in the gardener\'s\r\nlodge. These were red-letter days for little Hans, as he loved his\r\ngranny and enjoyed most thoroughly the pleasant garden and pretty\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s first great trouble came when his father caught a fever and\r\ndied, leaving his mother without any means of support. To keep the\r\nlittle home together his mother went out washing for her neighbours,\r\nleaving little Hans to take care of himself. Being left to his own\r\ndevices, Hans developed his theatrical tendencies by constructing\r\ncostumes for his puppets, and making them perform his plays on the stage\r\nof his toy theatre. Soon he varied this employment by reading plays and\r\nalso writing some himself. His mother, though secretly rejoicing in her\r\nson\'s talent, soon saw the necessity for his doing something more\r\npractical with his time and assisting her to keep the home together. So\r\nat twelve years of age Hans was sent to a cloth-weaving factory, where\r\nhe earned a small weekly wage. The weavers soon discovered that Hans\r\ncould sing, and the men frequently made him amuse them, while the other\r\nboys were made to do his work. One day the weavers played a coarse\r\npractical joke on poor sensitive Hans, which sent him flying home in\r\nsuch deep distress that his mother said he should not again return to\r\nthe factory.\r\n\r\nHans was now sent to the parish school for a few hours daily, and his\r\nspare time was taken up with his "peep-show" and in fashioning smart\r\nclothes for his puppets. His mother intended to apprentice her son to\r\nthe tailoring, but Hans had fully made up his mind to become an actor\r\nand seek his fortune in Copenhagen. After his Confirmation--on which\r\ngreat occasion he wore his father\'s coat and his first new boots--his\r\nmother insisted on his being apprenticed without further delay. With\r\ndifficulty he finally succeeded in persuading her to let him start for\r\nthe capital with his few savings. His mother had married again, so could\r\nnot accompany him; therefore, with reluctance and with many injunctions\r\nto return at once if all did not turn out well, she let him go.\r\nAccompanying him to the town gate, they passed a gipsy on the way, who,\r\non being asked what fortune she could prophesy for the poor lad, said he\r\nwould return a great man, and his native place would be illuminated and\r\ndecorated in his honour!\r\n\r\nHans arrived in Copenhagen on September 5, a date which he considered\r\nlucky for ever after. A few days in the city soon saw an end to his\r\nmoney. He applied and got work at a carpenter\'s shop, but was driven\r\naway by the coarseness of his fellow-workers. Hans made a friend of the\r\nporter at the stage-door of the theatre, and begged for some employment\r\nin the theatre; so occasionally he was allowed to walk across the stage\r\nin a crowd, but obtained scanty remuneration, and the lad was often\r\nhungry. Starving and destitute, the happy idea occurred to our hero to\r\ntry and earn something by his voice. He applied to Siboni, the Director\r\nof the Music School, and was admitted to his presence whilst the latter\r\nwas at dinner. Fortunately for Hans, Baggersen the poet and Weyse the\r\ncelebrated composer were of the party, so for their amusement the boy\r\nwas asked to sing and recite. Weyse was so struck by the quality of his\r\nvoice and Baggersen with his poetic feeling, that they made a collection\r\namong them there and then for him, and Siboni undertook to train his\r\nvoice. Unfortunately, in six months\' time his voice gave way, and Siboni\r\ncounselled him to learn a trade. Hans returned to the theatre in the\r\nhope of employment, and his persistence finally gained him a place in a\r\nmarket scene. Making a friend of the son of the librarian, he obtained\r\npermission to read at the library, and he wrote tragedies and plays,\r\nsome of which he took to the director of the theatre. This man became\r\nAndersen\'s friend for life, for the grains of gold which he saw in his\r\nwork, marred though it was by want of education, roused his interest.\r\nThe director brought Andersen to the notice of the King, and he was sent\r\nto the Latin school, where he took his place--although now a grown\r\nman--among the boys in the lowest class but one. The master\'s tongue was\r\nsharp, and the sensitive youth was dismayed by his own ignorance. The\r\nkindness and sympathetic encouragement of the director was the only\r\nbrightness of this period of Hans\' life. University life followed that\r\nof school, and Andersen took a good degree. He now wrote a play, which\r\nwas accepted and produced at the theatre with such success that he wept\r\nfor joy. Soon his poems were published, and happiness and prosperity\r\nfollowed. Later the King granted him a travelling stipend, of forty-five\r\npounds a year, and travelling became his greatest pleasure. Andersen\r\nvisited England two or three times, and reckoned Charles Dickens among\r\nhis friends. He was the honoured guest of Kings and Princes, and the\r\nRoyal Family of Denmark treated him as a personal friend.\r\n\r\nThough his "Fairy Tales" are the best known of his writings, he wrote\r\nsuccessful novels, dramas and poems. Andersen\'s tastes were simple, and\r\nhis child-like, affectionate nature made him much beloved by all. His\r\nnative town, which he left as a poor boy, was illuminated and decorated\r\nto welcome his return. Thus the gipsy\'s prophecy came true. He died\r\nafter the public celebration of his seventieth birthday, leaving all his\r\nfortune to the family of his beloved benefactor, the director of the\r\ntheatre. A beautiful bronze monument is erected to his memory in the\r\nchildren\'s garden of the King\'s Park, Copenhagen. Here the little Danes\r\nhave ever a gentle reminder of their great friend, Hans C. Andersen, who\r\nfelt--to use his own words--"like a poor boy who had had a King\'s mantle\r\nthrown over him."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAG\xc3\x96R PEASANT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFAMOUS DANES\r\n\r\n\r\nBertel Thorvaldsen (1770-1844), the famous Danish sculptor, was born in\r\nCopenhagen. His father was an Icelander, his mother a Dane, and both\r\nvery poor. Bertel\'s ambition when a little boy was to work his mother\'s\r\nspinning-wheel, which, of course, he was never permitted to do. One\r\nbright, moonlight night his parents were awakened by a soft, whirring\r\nsound, and found their little son enjoying his realized ambition. In the\r\nmoonlit room he had successfully started the wheel and begun to spin,\r\nmuch to his parents\' astonishment. This was the beginning of his\r\ncreative genius, but many years went over his youthful head before he\r\ncreated the works which made him famous. His father carved wooden\r\nfigure-heads for ships, and intended his son to follow the same calling.\r\nBertel, however, soon showed talent and inclination for something\r\nbetter, and was sent to the Free School of the Art Academy, there making\r\ngreat progress. He received very little education beyond what the Art\r\nSchool gave him, and his youthful days were hard and poverty-stricken.\r\nWhen his hours at the Academy were over he went from house to house\r\ntrying to sell his models, and in this way eked out a scanty living. In\r\nspite of his poverty he was wholly satisfied, for his wants were few.\r\nHis dog and his pipe, both necessities for happiness, accompanied him in\r\nall his wanderings.\r\n\r\nHis true artistic career only began in earnest when he won a travelling\r\nscholarship and went to Rome, where he arrived on his twenty-seventh\r\nbirthday. Stimulated to do his best by the many beautiful works of art\r\nwhich surrounded him, he found production easy, and the classical beauty\r\nof the Roman school appealed to him. Regretting his wasted years, he set\r\nto work in great earnest, and during the rest of his life produced a\r\nmarvellous amount of beautiful work. A rich Scotsman bought his first\r\nimportant work, and the money thus obtained was the means of starting\r\nhim firmly on his upward career. This highly talented Dane founded the\r\nfamous Sculpture School of Denmark, which is of world-wide reputation.\r\nThorvaldsen\'s beautiful designs--which were mainly classical--were\r\nconceived with great rapidity, and his pupils carried many of them out,\r\nbecoming celebrated sculptors also. Dying suddenly in 1844, while seated\r\nin the stalls of the theatre watching the play, his loss was a national\r\ncalamity. He bequeathed all his works to the nation, and these now form\r\nthe famous Thorvaldsen Museum, which attracts the artistic-loving people\r\nof all nations to the city of Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nIn the courtyard of this museum lies the great man\'s simple grave, his\r\nbeautiful works being contained in the building which surrounds it.\r\n\r\nAt the top of this Etruscan tomb stands a fine bronze allegorical\r\ngroup--the Goddess of Victory in her car, drawn by prancing\r\nhorses--fitting memorial to this greatest of northern sculptors.\r\n\r\nHolger Drachmann was the son of a physician, and quite early in life\r\nbecame a man of letters. Following the profession of an artist, he\r\nbecame a very good marine painter. This poet loved the sea in all its\r\nmoods, and was never happier than when at Skagen--the extreme northern\r\npoint of Jutland--where he spent most of his summers. His painting was\r\nhis favourite pastime, but poetry the serious work of his life. He was a\r\nvery prolific writer, not only of verse and lyrical poems, but of plays\r\nand prose works, and was a very successful playwright. Drachmann\'s\r\npersonality was a strong one, though not always agreeable to his\r\ncountrymen. He had a freedom-loving spirit, and lived every moment of\r\nhis life. Some of his best poems are about the Skaw fishermen, and later\r\nin life he settled down among them, dying at Skagen in 1907. He was a\r\npicturesque figure, with white flowing locks, erratic and unpractical,\r\nas poets often are. Like other famous Danes, he chose a unique\r\nburial-place. Away at Grenen, in the sand-dunes, overlooking the\r\nfighting waters of the Skagerack and Cattegat, stands his\r\ncromlech-shaped tomb, near the roar of the sea he loved so much, where\r\ntime and sand will soon obliterate all that remains of the Byron of\r\nDenmark.\r\n\r\nNikolai Frederik Grundtvig, the founder of the popular high-schools for\r\npeasants, was born at his father\'s parsonage, Udby, South Seeland. He\r\nwas sent to school in Jutland, and soon learned to love his wild native\r\nmoors. While attending the Latin School in Aarhus he made friends with\r\nan old shoemaker, who used to tell him interesting stories of the old\r\nNorse heroes and sagas, often repeating the old Danish folk-songs. The\r\nlad being a true Dane, a descendant of the old vikings, he soon became\r\nvery interested in the history of his race. Being sent to the University\r\nof Copenhagen, he chose to study Icelandic in order to read the ancient\r\nsagas, English to read Shakespeare, and German to read Goethe. This\r\nstudious youth was most patriotic, and the poetry of his country\r\nappealed to him especially. \xc3\x98ehlenschl\xc3\xa4ger\'s (a Danish poet) works fired\r\nhis poetical imagination.\r\n\r\nGrundtvig\'s poems were for the people, the beloved Jutland moors and\r\nNature generally his theme. His songs and poems are loved by the\r\npeasants, and used at all their festivals. He wrote songs "that would\r\nmake bare legs skip at sound of them," and, "like a bird in the\r\ngreenwood, he would sing for the country-folk." So successfully did he\r\nwrite these folk-songs, that "bare legs" do skip at the sound of them\r\neven to-day at every festivity. He was an educational enthusiast, and\r\nhis high-schools are peculiar to Denmark. It is owing to these that the\r\ncountry possesses such a splendid band of peasant farmers. Being a\r\npriest, he was given the honorary title of Bishop, and founded a sect\r\ncalled "Grundtvigianere."\r\n\r\nThis noble man died in 1872, over ninety years of age, working and\r\npreaching till the last, his deep-set eyes, flowing white hair and\r\nbeard, making him look like Moses of old.\r\n\r\nAdam \xc3\x98ehlenschl\xc3\xa4ger, the greatest Danish dramatist and poet, was a\r\nProfessor at the University of Copenhagen, and a marvellously gifted\r\nman. He developed and gave character to Danish literature, and is known\r\nas the "Goethe of the North." Some of his finest tragedies have been\r\ntranslated into English. These have a distinctly northern ring about\r\nthem, dealing as they do with the legends and sagas of the Scandinavian\r\npeople. These tragedies of the mythical heroes of Scandinavia, the\r\nhistory of their race, and, indeed, all the works of this king of\r\nnorthern poets, are greatly loved by all Scandinavians. Every young Dane\r\ndelights in \xc3\x98ehlenschl\xc3\xa4ger as we do in Shakespeare, and by reading his\r\nworks the youths of Denmark lay the foundation of their education in\r\npoetry. This bard was crowned Laureate in Lund (Sweden) by the greatest\r\nof Swedish poets, Esaias Tegner, 1829. Buried by his own request at his\r\nbirth-place, Frederiksberg, two Danish miles (which means eight English\r\nmiles) from Copenhagen, his loving countrymen insisted on carrying him\r\nthe whole distance, so great was their admiration for this King of\r\ndramatists.\r\n\r\nNiels Ryberg Finsen, whose name I am sure you have heard because his\r\nscientific research gave us the "light-cure"--which has been established\r\nat the London Hospital by our Queen Alexandra, who generously gave the\r\ncostly apparatus required for the cure in order to benefit afflicted\r\nEnglish people--was born at Thorshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands.\r\nThese islands are under Denmark, and lie north of the Shetlands. His\r\nfather was magistrate there. His parents were Icelanders. At twelve\r\nyears of age Niels was sent to school in Denmark, and after a few years\r\nat the Grammar School of Herlufholm, he returned to his parents, who\r\nwere now stationed in their native town, Reykjavik, the capital of\r\nIceland. Niels continued his studies there, and when old enough returned\r\nto Denmark to commence his medical work at the University of Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nHitherto he had shown no particular aptitude, but in his medical work he\r\nsoon distinguished himself, and his skill gained him a place in the\r\nlaboratory. He now began to study the effect of light as a curative\r\nremedy. All his life Finsen thought the sunlight the most beautiful\r\nthing in the world--perhaps because he saw so little of it in his\r\nchildhood. He had watched its wonderful effect on all living things,\r\nbeing much impressed by the transformation caused in nature by the warm\r\nlife-giving rays. With observations on lizards, which he found\r\ncharmingly responsive to sun effects, he accidentally made his\r\ndiscovery, and gave to the world this famous remedy for diseases of the\r\nskin, which has relieved thousands of sufferers of all nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLEGENDARY LORE AND FOLK DANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legend of Holger Danske, who is to be Denmark\'s deliverer when heavy\r\ntroubles come upon her, is one which has its counterpart in other\r\ncountries, resembling that of our own King Arthur and the German\r\nFrederick Barbarossa. When Denmark\'s necessity demands, Holger Danske\r\nwill come to her aid; till then he sits "in the deep dark cellar of\r\nKronborg Castle, into which none may enter. He is clad in iron and\r\nsteel, and rests his head on his strong arms; his long beard hangs down\r\nupon the marble table, into which it has become firmly rooted; he sleeps\r\nand dreams. But in his dreams he sees all that happens in Denmark. On\r\neach Christmas Eve an angel comes to him and tells him all he has\r\ndreamed is true, and that he may sleep again in peace, as Denmark is not\r\nyet in real danger. But should danger ever come, then Holger Danske will\r\nrouse himself, and the table will burst asunder as he draws out his\r\nbeard. Then he will come forth in all his strength, and strike a blow\r\nthat shall sound in all the countries of the world."\r\n\r\nHolger Danske was the son of the Danish King Gotrick. While he was a\r\nyouth his father sent him to Carolus Magnus, whom he served during all\r\nhis wars. Thus he came to India, where he ate a fruit which made his\r\nbody imperishable. When Denmark is near ruin, and all her young men have\r\nbeen slain in defending her, then Holger Danske will appear, and,\r\ngathering round him all the young boys and aged men, will lead them on\r\nto victory, routing the enemy, and thus saving the country. When a\r\nlittle plant growing in the Lake of Viborg has become a tree, so large\r\nthat you can tie your horse to it, then the time draws near when all\r\nthis will happen.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time the Danes were in great trouble, for they had no King.\r\nBut one day they saw a barque, splendidly decked, sailing towards the\r\ncoast of Denmark. As the ship came nearer the shore they saw it was\r\nladen with quantities of gold and weapons, but not a soul was to be seen\r\non board. When the Danes boarded the ship, they found a little boy lying\r\nasleep on the deck, and above his head floated a golden banner. Thinking\r\nthat their god Odin had sent the boy, they brought him ashore and\r\nproclaimed him King. They named him Skjold, and he became a great and\r\ngood King. His fame was such that the Danish Kings to this day are\r\ncalled "Skjoldunger." When this King died, his body was placed on board\r\na ship which was loaded with treasure; and when it sailed slowly away\r\nover the blue water, the Danes stood on the shore looking after it with\r\nsorrow. What became of the ship no one ever knew.\r\n\r\nDenmark is rich in legends. There is the legend about the "Danebrog,"\r\nDenmark\'s national flag, which is a white cross on a crimson ground.\r\nThis bright and beautiful flag looks thoroughly at home whatever its\r\nsurroundings. The story goes that when Valdemar Seir (the Victorious)\r\ndescended on the shores of Esthonia to help the knights who were hard\r\npressed in a battle with the heathen Esthonians (1219), a miracle befell\r\nhim. The valour of his troops soon made an impression on the pagans, and\r\nthey began to sue for peace. It was granted, and the priests baptized\r\nthe supposed converts. Very soon, however, the Esthonians, who had been\r\nsecretly reinforcing while pretending submission, in order to throw dust\r\nin the eyes of the too confiding Danes, brought up their forces and\r\ncommenced fighting anew. "It was the eve of St. Vitus, and the Danes\r\nwere singing Vespers in camp, when suddenly a wild howl rang through the\r\nsummer evening, and the heathens poured out of the woods, attacked the\r\nsurprised Danes on all sides, and quickly thinned their ranks. The Danes\r\nbegan to waver, but the Prince of Rugen, who was stationed on the hill,\r\nhad time to rally his followers and stay the progress of the enemy. It\r\nwas a terrible battle. The Archbishop Andreas Sunesen with his priests\r\nmounted the hill to lay the sword of prayer in the scales of battle; the\r\nDanes rallied, and their swords were not blunt when they turned upon\r\ntheir enemies. Whilst the Archbishop and others prayed, the Danes were\r\ntriumphant; but when his arms fell to his side through sheer weariness,\r\nthe heathens prevailed. Then the priests supported the aged man\'s arms,\r\nwho, like Moses of old, supplicated for his people with extended hands.\r\nThe battle was still raging, and the banner of the Danes had been lost\r\nin the fight. As the prayers continued the miracle happened. A red\r\nbanner, with the Holy Cross in white upon it, came floating gently down\r\nfrom the heavens, and a voice was heard saying, \'When this sign is borne\r\non high you shall conquer.\' The tide of battle turned, the Christians\r\ngathered themselves together under the banner of the Cross, and the\r\nheathens were filled with fear and fled. Then the Danes knelt down on\r\nthe battle-field and praised God, while King Valdemar drew his sword,\r\nand for the first time under the folds of the Danebrog dubbed\r\nfive-and-thirty of the bravest heroes knights." Another legend tells the\r\nfate of a wicked Queen of Denmark, Gunhild by name. This Queen was first\r\nthe consort of a Norwegian monarch, who, finding her more than he or his\r\npeople could stand, thrust her out of his kingdom. She made her way to\r\nDenmark, and soon after married the Danish King. Though beautiful, Queen\r\nGunhild\'s pride and arrogance made her hateful to her new subjects, and\r\nher attendants watched their opportunity to rid themselves of such an\r\nobnoxious mistress. The time came for them when the Queen was travelling\r\nthrough Jutland. A sign was given to her bearers, whilst journeying\r\nthrough the marshes near Vejle, to drop her down into the bog. This was\r\ndone, and a stake driven through her body. To-day in the church at Vejle\r\na body lies enclosed in a glass coffin, with a stake lying beside it,\r\nthe teeth and long black hair being in excellent preservation. This body\r\nwas found in 1821, when the marshes near Vejle were being drained for\r\ncultivation. The stake was found through it, thus giving colour to the\r\ntradition. Poor Queen! lost in the eleventh century and found in the\r\nnineteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Folk-dancers._\r\n\r\nThe Danes, like all the Scandinavians, are renowned for their love of\r\ndancing. Lately they have revived the beautiful old folk-dances,\r\nrealizing at last the necessity of keeping the ancient costumes, dances\r\nand songs before the people, if they would not have them completely\r\nwiped out. A few patriotic Danes have formed a society of ladies and\r\ngentlemen to bring about this revival. These are called the\r\nfolk-dancers, their object being to stimulate the love of old-time\r\nDenmark in the modern Dane, by showing him the dance, accompanied by\r\nfolk-song, which his forefathers delighted in. Old-time ways the Dane of\r\nto-day is perhaps a little too ready to forget, but dance and song\r\nappeal to his northern nature. The beautiful old costumes of the Danish\r\npeasants have almost entirely disappeared, but those worn by the\r\nfolk-dancers are facsimiles of the costumes formerly worn in the\r\ndistricts they represent. These costumes, with heavy gold embroidery,\r\ncurious hats, or pretty velvet caps, weighty with silver lace, must have\r\nbeen a great addition to local colouring. The men also wore a gay dress,\r\nand it is to be regretted that these old costumes have disappeared from\r\nthe villages and islands of Denmark.\r\n\r\nIn olden times the voice was the principal accompaniment of the dance,\r\nand these folk-lorists generally sing while dancing; but occasionally a\r\nfiddler or flautist plays for them, and becomes the leader in the dance.\r\nSome of these dances are of a comical nature, and no doubt were invented\r\nto parody the shortcomings of some local character. Others represent\r\nlocal industries. A pretty dance is "Voeve Vadmel" (cloth-weaving). In\r\nthis some dancers become the bobbins, others form the warp and woof;\r\nthus they go in and out, weaving themselves into an imaginary piece of\r\ncloth. Then, rolling themselves into a bale, they stand a moment,\r\nunwind, reverse, and then disperse. This dance is accompanied by the\r\nvoices of the dancers, who, as they sing, describe each movement of the\r\ndance. A very curious dance is called "Seven Springs," and its principal\r\nfigure is a series of springs from the floor, executed by the lady,\r\naided by her partner. Another two are called respectively the "Men\'s\r\nPleasure" and the "Girls\' Pleasure." In these both men and girls choose\r\ntheir own partners, and coquet with them by alluring facial expressions\r\nduring the dance. The "Tinker\'s Dance" is a solo dance for a man, which\r\nis descriptive and amusing; while the "Degnedans" is more an amusing\r\nperformance in pantomime than a dance, executed by two men. Many more\r\nthan I can tell you about have been revived by the folk-dancers, who\r\ntake a keen delight in discovering and learning them. They are\r\nentertaining and instructive to the looker-on, and a healthy, though\r\nfatiguing, amusement for the dancers.\r\n\r\nIn the Faroe Islands the old-time way is still in vogue, and the dance\r\nis only accompanied by the voice and clapping of hands. Thus do these\r\ndescendants of the old vikings keep high festival to celebrate a good\r\n"catch" of whales.\r\n\r\nThe old folk-songs, which were sung by the people when dancing and at\r\nother times, have a national value which the Danes fully realize, many\r\nbeing written down and treasured in the country\'s archives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMANNERS AND CUSTOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Danes being a polite and well-mannered race, the children are early\r\ntaught to tender thanks for little pleasures, and this they do in a\r\npretty way by thrusting out their tiny hands and saying, "Tak" (Thank\r\nyou). It is the Danish custom to greet everybody, including the\r\nservants, with "Good-morning," and always on entering a shop you give\r\ngreeting, and say farewell on leaving. In the market-place it is the\r\nsame; also the children, when leaving school, raise their caps to the\r\nteacher and call out, "Farvel! farvel!" In the majority of houses when\r\nthe people rise from the table they say, "Tak for Mad"[1] to the host,\r\nwho replies, "Velbekomme."[2] The children kiss their parents and say\r\nthe same, while the parents often kiss each other and say, "Velbekomme."\r\nThe Danes are rather too eager to wipe out old customs, and in\r\nCopenhagen the fashionable people ignore this pretty ceremony. The\r\nmajority, however, feel uncomfortable if not allowed to thank their host\r\nor hostess for their food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHILDREN\'S DAY.]\r\n\r\nA Danish lady, about to visit England for the first time, was told\r\nthat here it was customary to say "Grace" after meals. The surprise of\r\nthe English host may be imagined when his Danish guest, on rising from\r\nthe table, solemnly put out her hand and murmured the word "Grace!"\r\nAfter a day or two, when this ceremony had been most dutifully performed\r\nafter every meal, the Englishman thought he had better ask for an\r\nexplanation. This was given, and the young Dane joined heartily in the\r\nlaugh against herself!\r\n\r\nThe Danes begin their day with a light breakfast of coffee, fresh rolls,\r\nand butter, but the children generally have porridge, or "\xc3\xb6llebr\xc3\xb6d,"\r\nbefore starting for school. This distinctly Danish dish is made of\r\nrye-bread, beer, milk, cream, and sometimes with the addition of a\r\nbeaten-up egg. This "Ske-Mad"[3] is very sustaining, but I fear would\r\nprove a little too much for those unaccustomed to it. \xc3\x98llebr\xc3\xb6d also is\r\nthe favourite Saturday supper-dish of the working-classes, with the\r\naddition of salt herrings and slices of raw onion, which doubtless\r\nrenders it more piquant.\r\n\r\nAt noon "Mid-dag"[4] is served. Another peculiar delicacy common both to\r\nthis meal and supper is "Sm\xc3\xb6rrebr\xc3\xb6d," a "variety" sandwich consisting of\r\na slice of bread and butter covered with sausage, ham, fish, meat,\r\ncheese, etc. making a tempting display, not hidden as in our sandwich by\r\na top layer of bread. The Danes are very hospitable, and often invite\r\npoor students to dine with them regularly once a week. Dinner consists\r\nof excellent soup (in summer made of fruit or preserves), meat, pudding\r\nor fruit, and cream, and even the poorest have coffee after this meal.\r\n\r\nPrunes, stewed plums or apples, and sometimes cranberry jam, are always\r\nserved with the meat or game course, together with excellent but rather\r\nrich sauce. The Danish housewife prides herself on the latter, as her\r\ncooking abilities are often judged by the quality of her sauces. It is\r\nquite usual for the Danish ladies to spend some months in learning\r\ncooking and housekeeping in a large establishment to complete their\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n"V\xc3\xa6r saa god"[5] says the maid or waiter when handing you anything, and\r\nthis formula is repeated by everyone when they wish you to enter a room,\r\nor, in fact, to do anything.\r\n\r\nBirthdays and other anniversaries are much thought of in Denmark. The\r\n"F\xc3\xb6delsdagsbarn"[6] is generally given pretty bouquets or pots of\r\nflowers, as well as presents. Flowers are used on every joyous occasion.\r\nStudents, both men and women, may be seen almost covered with bright\r\nnosegays, given by their friends to celebrate any examination\r\nsuccessfully passed.\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve, and not Christmas Day, is the festive occasion in\r\nDenmark. Everybody, including the poorest, must have a Christmas-tree,\r\nand roast goose, apple-cake, rice porridge with an almond in it, form\r\nthe banquet. The lucky person who finds the almond receives an extra\r\npresent, and much mirth is occasioned by the search. The tree is lighted\r\nat dusk, and the children dance round it and sing. This performance\r\nopens the festivities; then the presents are given, dinner served, and\r\nafterwards the young people dance.\r\n\r\nChristmas Day is kept quietly, but the day after (St. Stephen\'s Day) is\r\none of merriment and gaiety, when the people go from house to house to\r\ngreet their friends and "skaal" with them.\r\n\r\nNew Year\'s Eve brings a masque ball for the young folk, a supper,\r\nfireworks, and at midnight a clinking of glasses, when healths are drunk\r\nin hot punch.\r\n\r\nOn Midsummer\'s Night fires are lighted all over the country, and people\r\ngather together to watch the burning of the tar-barrels. Near a lake or\r\non the seashore the reflections glinting on the water make a strangely\r\nbrilliant sight. On some of the fjords a water carnival makes a pretty\r\naddition to these fires, which the children are told have been lighted\r\nto scare the witches!\r\n\r\nThe Monday before Lent is a holiday in all the schools. Early in the\r\nmorning the children, provided with decorated sticks, "fastelavns Ris,"\r\nrouse their parents and others from slumber. All who are found asleep\r\nafter a certain time must pay a forfeit of Lenten buns. Later in the day\r\nthe children dress themselves up in comical costume and parade the\r\nstreets, asking money from the passer-by as our children do on Guy\r\nFawkes\' Day.\r\n\r\nA holy-day peculiar to Denmark is called "Store-Bededag" (Great Day of\r\nPrayer), on the eve of which (Danes keep eves of festivals only) the\r\nchurch bells ring and the people promenade in their best clothes.\r\n"Store-Bededag" is the fourth Friday after Easter, and all business is\r\nat a standstill, so that the people can attend church. On Whit-Sunday\r\nsome of the young folks rise early to see the sun dance on the water and\r\nwash their faces in the dew. This is in preparation for the greatest\r\nholiday in the year, Whit-Monday, when all give themselves up to outdoor\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n"Grundlovsdag," which is kept in commemoration of the granting of a free\r\nConstitution to the nation by Frederik VII., gives the town bands and\r\ntrade-unions an opportunity to parade the streets and display their\r\ncapability in playing national music. "Children\'s Day" is a school\r\nholiday, and the children dress in the old picturesque Danish costumes;\r\nthey then go about the town and market-places begging alms for the\r\nsanatoriums in their collecting-boxes. In this way a large sum is\r\ncollected for these charities.\r\n\r\n"Knocking-the-cat-out-of-the-barrel" is an old custom of the peasantry\r\nwhich takes place the Monday before Lent. The young men dress themselves\r\ngaily, and, armed with wooden clubs, hie them to the village green. Here\r\na barrel is suspended with a cat inside it. Each man knocks the barrel\r\nwith his club as he runs underneath it, and he who knocks a hole big\r\nenough to liberate poor puss is the victor. The grotesque costumes, the\r\ndifficulty of stooping and running under the barrel in them, when all\r\nyour energies and attention are required for the blow, result in many a\r\ncomical catastrophe, which the bystanders enjoy heartily. Puss is\r\nfrightened, but not hurt, and I think it would be just as amusing\r\nwithout the cat, but the Danish peasants think otherwise. Another\r\npastime which takes place on the same day is called "ring-riding." The\r\nmen, wearing paper hats and gay ribbons, gallop round the course, trying\r\nto snatch a suspended ring in passing. The man who takes the ring three\r\ntimes in succession is called "King," he who takes it twice "Prince."\r\nWhen the sport is over, King and Prince, with their train of\r\nunsuccessful competitors, ride round to the farms and demand refreshment\r\nfor their gay cavalcade, of which "\xc3\x86leskiver," a peasant delicacy,\r\nwashed down by a glass of aqua-vit\xc3\xa6, forms a part.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of "Valborg\'s Dag" (May-Day) bonfires are lighted, and the\r\nyoung Danes have a dinner and dance given to them. Each dance is so long\r\nthat it is customary for the young men to change their partners two or\r\nthree times during the waltz.\r\n\r\nA beautiful custom is still preserved among the older peasantry: when\r\nthey cross the threshold of their neighbour\'s house they say, "God\'s\r\npeace be in this house."\r\n\r\nAll domestic servants, students, and other people who reside away from\r\nhome for a time, take about with them a chest of drawers as well as a\r\ntrunk. I suppose they find this necessary, because in Denmark a chest of\r\ndrawers is seldom provided in a bedroom.\r\n\r\nWhen the first snowdrops appear, the boys and girls gather some and\r\nenclose them in a piece of paper, on which is written a poem. This\r\n"Vinterg\xc3\xa6kke-Brev," which they post to their friends, is signed by\r\nink-spots, as numerous as the letters in their name. The friend must\r\nguess the name of the sender within a week, or the latter demands a\r\ngift.\r\n\r\nConfirmation means coming-out in Denmark. As this is the greatest\r\nfestival of youth, the young folk are loaded with presents; then girls\r\nput up their hair and boys begin to smoke.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of a daughter is an expensive affair for parents in\r\nDenmark, as they are supposed to find all the home for the bride, as\r\nwell as the trousseau. The wedding-ring is worn by both while engaged,\r\nas well as after the marriage ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe Epiphany is celebrated in many homes by the burning of three\r\ncandles, and the children are given a holiday on this, the festival of\r\nthe Three Kings. No doubt you know this is a commemoration of the three\r\nwise men of the East presenting their offerings of gold, frankincense,\r\nand myrrh to our Lord.\r\n\r\nStorks are considered the sacred birds of Denmark. These harbingers of\r\ngood-luck the children take great interest in, and more especially in\r\nthe growth of the stork family on the roof-tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA JAUNT THROUGH JUTLAND--I\r\n\r\n\r\nJutland is the only province left to Denmark which can claim to be\r\nmainland, and though it is the most northern part of the country, some\r\nof its scenery is very beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe "Jyde," as the people of Jutland are called, are proud of their\r\nbirthplace, of their language, and of their pronunciation, which the\r\nCopenhageners call "accent," but the Jyde declare they speak the purest\r\nDanish in the kingdom. However this may be, I am not in a position to\r\njudge, but I do know that I can understand the Jyde Danish better, and\r\nthat it falls upon my ear with a more pleasing sound than does the\r\nDanish of the Copenhageners.\r\n\r\nThe east coast of Jutland is quite charming, so we will start our tour\r\nfrom the first interesting spot on this route, and try to obtain a\r\nglimpse of the country.\r\n\r\nIn Kolding stands a famous castle, which was partially burnt down in\r\n1808. This gigantic ruin is now covered in, and used as an historical\r\nmuseum for war relics.\r\n\r\nFredericia is a very important place. Here that part of the train which\r\ncontains the goods, luggage, and mails, as well as the first-class\r\npassenger carriages for Copenhagen, is shunted on to the large steam\r\nferry-boat waiting to receive it. This carries it across the smiling\r\nwaters of the Little Belt. A fresh engine then takes it across the\r\nisland of Funen to the steam-ferry waiting to carry it across the Great\r\nBelt to Kors\xc3\xb6r, on the shores of Seeland, when a locomotive takes the\r\ntrain to Copenhagen in the ordinary way. These steam-ferries are\r\npeculiar to Denmark, and are specially built and equipped for this work.\r\nDanish enterprise overcomes the difficulties of transport through a\r\nkingdom of islands by these ferries.\r\n\r\nFredericia is an old fortified town with mighty city walls, which make a\r\nfine promenade for the citizens, giving them a charming view of the\r\nLittle Belt\'s sunlit waters. In this town the Danes won a glorious\r\nvictory over the Prussians in 1849.\r\n\r\nVejle is one of the most picturesque places on the east coast. Along the\r\nVejlefjord the tall, straight pines of Jutland are reflected in the\r\ncool, still depths of blue water, and the tiniest of puffing steamers\r\nwill carry you over to Munkebjerg. The fascinating and famous Munkebjerg\r\nForest is very beautiful--a romantic place in which the youthful lovers\r\nof Denmark delight. These glorious beech woods extend for miles, the\r\ntrees sloping down to the water\'s edge from a high ridge, whence you\r\nhave a magnificent view of the glittering fjord. Most inviting are\r\nthese cool green shades on a hot summer\'s day, but when clothed in the\r\nglowing tints of autumn they present to the eye a feast of gorgeous\r\ncolour. A golden and warm brown carpet of crisp, crackling leaves\r\nunderfoot, the lap of the fjord as a steamer ploughs along, sending the\r\nwater hissing through the bowing reeds which fringe the bank, make the\r\nsoothing sounds which fall on lovers\' ears as they wander through these\r\npleasant glades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARVEST TIME.]\r\n\r\nIn winter this forest is left to the snow and hoarfrost, and cold, cairn\r\nbeauty holds it fast for many days.\r\n\r\nThe pretty hotel of Munkebjerg, standing on the summit of the ridge,\r\nwhich you espy through a clearing in the trees, is reached by some\r\nscores of steps from the landing-stage. Patient "Moses," the hotel\r\nluggage-carrier, awaits the prospective guests at the pier. This\r\nhandsome brown donkey is quite a character, and mounts gaily his own\r\nprivate zigzag path leading to the hotel when heavily laden. His\r\ndejection, however, when returning with empty panniers, is accounted for\r\nby the circumstance of "No load, no carrot!" at the end of the climb.\r\n\r\nGrejsdal is another beautiful spot inland from the fjord, past which the\r\nprimitive local train takes us to Jellinge. In this quaint upland\r\nvillage stand the two great barrows, the reputed graves of King Gorm and\r\nQueen Thyra, his wife, the great-grandparents of Canute the Great, the\r\nDanish King who ruled over England for twenty years. A beautiful Norman\r\nchurch stands between these barrows, and two massive Runic stones tell\r\nthat "Harald the King commanded this memorial to be raised to Gorm, his\r\nFather, and Thyra, his Mother: the Harald who conquered the whole of\r\nDenmark and Norway, and Christianized the Danes." Steps lead to the top\r\nof these grassy barrows, and so large are they that over a thousand men\r\ncan stand at the top. The village children use them as a playground\r\noccasionally.\r\n\r\nSkanderborg, which is prettily situated on a lake, is a celebrated town.\r\nHere a famous siege took place, in which the valiant Niels Ebbesen fell,\r\nafter freeing his country from the tyrannical rule of the German Count\r\nGert.\r\n\r\nAarhus, the capital of Jutland, is the second oldest town in Denmark.\r\nIts interesting cathedral is the longest in the kingdom, and was built\r\nin the twelfth century. The town possesses a magnificent harbour, on the\r\nCattegat, the shores of which make a pleasant promenade.\r\n\r\nRanders is a pretty place, with many quaint thatched houses belonging to\r\nthe sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. The Gudenaa,\r\nDenmark\'s only river, skirts the town. This river is narrow and\r\nslow-moving, as there are no heights to give it force.\r\n\r\nHobro, situated on a fjord, wears an air of seclusion, lying as it does\r\nfar away from the railway-station. A sail on this fjord will bring us to\r\nMariager, the smallest town in Denmark. Renowned are the magnificent\r\nbeech-woods and ancient abbey of this tiny town. In the surroundings we\r\nhave a panoramic view of typical Jutish scenery--a charming landscape in\r\nthe sunset glow, forest, fjord, farmsteads, and moor affording a rich\r\nvariety of still life.\r\n\r\nAalborg, the delightful old market town on the Limfjord, is fascinating,\r\nespecially at night, when its myriad lamps throw long shafts of light\r\nacross the water. Scattered through the town are many old half-timbered\r\nhouses. These beautiful buildings, with their cream-coloured rough-cast\r\nwalls, oak beams, richly carved overhanging eaves, and soft-red tiled\r\nroofs, show little evidence of the ravages of time. The most famous of\r\nthese houses was built, in the seventeenth century, by Jens Bang, an\r\napothecary. The chemist\'s shop occupies the large ground-floor room, the\r\nwindows of which have appropriate key-stones. On one is carved a man\'s\r\nhead with swollen face, another with a lolling tongue, and similar\r\ngrotesques.\r\n\r\nTo be an idler and watch the traffic going to and fro over the pontoon\r\nbridge which spans the Limfjord is a delightful way of passing the time.\r\nWarmed by the sun and fanned by the breezes which blow along the fjord,\r\nyou may be amused and interested for hours by the life that streams past\r\nyou. Occasionally the traffic is impeded by the bridge being opened to\r\nallow the ships to pass through. Small vessels can in this way save time\r\nand avoid the danger of rounding the north point of Jutland. If you\r\nlook at your map you will see that this fjord cuts through Jutland, thus\r\nmaking a short passage from the Cattegat to the North Sea.\r\n\r\nJutland north of the Limfjord is called Vendsyssel. Curious effects of\r\nmirage may be seen in summer-time in the extensive "Vildmose"[7] of this\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA JAUNT THROUGH JUTLAND--II\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we pass through Vendsyssel homely farmsteads and windmills add a\r\ncharm to the landscape, while tethered kine and sportive goats complete\r\na picture of rural life.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrive at Frederikshavn we come to the end of the State railway.\r\nThis terminus lies close to the port, which is an important place of\r\ncall for the large passenger and cargo steamers bound for Norway and\r\nother countries, as well as being a refuge for the fishing-fleet.\r\n\r\nA slow-moving local train takes us across the sandy wastes to Skagen, a\r\nstraggling village, with the dignity of royal borough, bestowed upon it\r\nby Queen Margaret, in the fourteenth century, as a reward to the brave\r\nfishermen who saved from shipwreck some of her kins-folk. Skagen is a\r\npicturesque and interesting place, the home of many artists, as well as\r\na noted seaside resort.\r\n\r\nBr\xc3\xb6ndum\'s Hotel, a celebrated hostelry, where the majority of visitors\r\nand artists stay, is a delightfully comfortable, homely dwelling. The\r\ndining-room, adorned with many specimens of the artists\' work, is a\r\nunique and interesting picture-gallery.\r\n\r\nOn the outskirts of the town the white tower of the old church of Skagen\r\nmay be seen peeping over the sand-dunes. This "stepped" tower, with its\r\nred-tiled, saddle-back roof, forms a striking feature in this weird and\r\nlonely landscape. The church itself is buried beneath the sand, leaving\r\nonly the tower to mark the place that is called the "Pompeii of\r\nDenmark," sand, not lava, being answerable for this entombment. It is\r\nsaid that the village which surrounded the church was buried by a\r\nsandstorm in the fourteenth century. This scene of desolation, on a\r\nwindy day, when the "sand fiend" revels and riots, is best left to the\r\nbooming surf and avoided by those who do not wish to be blinded.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Skagen lie other curious phenomena created by this\r\n"Storm King." The "Raabjerg Miler" are vast and characteristic dunes of\r\npowdery sand in long ridges, like huge waves petrified in the very act\r\nof turning over! In the neighbouring quicksands trees have been planted,\r\nbut refuse to grow.\r\n\r\nViborg, the old capital of Jutland, possesses an historically\r\ninteresting cathedral. In the crypt stands the tomb of King Eric\r\nGlipping, as well as those of other monarchs. The interior of the\r\ncathedral is decorated with fine frescoes by modern artists.\r\n\r\nAs we journey to Silkeborg we pass through the vast heathland, "Alhede,"\r\nand are impressed by the plodding perseverance of the heath-folk. The\r\nmarvellous enterprise of the Danes who started and have so successfully\r\ncarried out the cultivation of these barren tracts of land deserves\r\nadmiration. The convicts are employed in this work, planting, trenching,\r\nand digging, making this waste land ready for the farmer. These men have\r\na cap with a visor-like mask, which can be pulled over the face at will.\r\nThis shields the face from the cold blasts so prevalent on these moors;\r\nalso, it prevents the prying eyes of strangers or fellow-workers.\r\n\r\nMany baby forests are being nursed into sturdy growth, as a protection\r\nfor farm-lands from the sand and wind storms.\r\n\r\nThis monotonous-looking heath is not without beauty; indeed, it has a\r\nmelancholy charm for those who dwell on it. The children love it when\r\nthe heather is in bloom, and spend happy days gathering berries from out\r\nof the gorgeous purple carpet. The great stacks of peat drying in the\r\nsun denote that this is the principal fuel of the moor-folk.\r\n\r\nFrom Silkeborg we start to see the Himmelbjerget, the mountain of this\r\nflat country. It rises to a height of five hundred feet, being the\r\nhighest point in Denmark.\r\n\r\n\'Tis the joy and pride of the Danes, who select this mountain and lake\r\ndistrict before all others for their honeymoons!\r\n\r\nA curious paddle-boat, worked by hand, or a small motor-boat will take\r\nus over the lake to the foot of Himmelbjerget. Our motor-boat, with\r\nfussy throb, carries us away down the narrow river which opens into the\r\nlake. The life on the banks of the river is very interesting. As we sail\r\npast the pretty villas, with background of cool, green beech-woods, we\r\nnotice that a Danish garden must always have a summer-house to make it\r\ncomplete. In these garden-rooms the Danes take all their meals in\r\nsummer-time. The drooping branches of the beech-trees dip, swish, and\r\nbend to the swirl of water created by our boat, which makes miniature\r\nwaves leap and run along the bank in a playful way. How delightfully\r\npeaceful the surrounding landscape is as we skim over the silvery lake\r\nand then land! The climbing of this mountain does not take long. There\r\nis a splendid view from the top of Himmelbjerget, for the country lies\r\nspread out like a map before us. This lake district is very beautiful,\r\nand when the ling is in full bloom, the heather and forest-clad hills\r\nencircling the lakes blaze with colour.\r\n\r\nAt Silkeborg the River Gudenaa flows through the lakes Kunds\xc3\xb6 and Juls\xc3\xb6,\r\nbecoming navigable, but it is only used by small boats and barges for\r\ntransporting wood from the forests. The termination "S\xc3\xb6" means lake,\r\nwhile "A\xc3\xa4" means stream. Steen Steensen Blicher, the poet of Jutland,\r\nhas described this scenery, which he loved so much, quite charmingly in\r\nsome of his lyrical poems. He sings:\r\n\r\n     "The Danes have their homes where the fair beeches grow,\r\n     By shores where forget-me-nots cluster."\r\n\r\nThis poet did much to encourage the home industries of the\r\nmoor-dwellers, being in sympathy with them, as well as with their lonely\r\nmoorlands.\r\n\r\nThe old-time moor-dwellers\' habitations have become an interesting\r\nmuseum in Herning. This little mid-Jutland town is in the centre of the\r\nmoors, so its museum contains a unique collection from the homes of\r\nthese sturdy peasants. The amount of delicate needlework these lonely,\r\nthrifty folks accomplished in the long winter days is surprising. This\r\n"Hedebo" needlework is the finest stitchery you can well imagine,\r\nwrought on home-spun linen with flaxen thread. Such marvellous patterns\r\nand intricate designs! Little wonder that the best examples are\r\ntreasured by the nation. The men of the family wore a white linen smock\r\nfor weddings and great occasions. So thickly are these overwrought with\r\nneedlework that they will stand alone, and seem to have a woman\'s\r\nlifetime spent upon them. Needless to say, these family garments were\r\nhanded down as heirlooms from father to son.\r\n\r\nKnitting, weaving, the making of Jyde pottery and wooden shoes (which\r\nall wear), are among the other industries of these people.\r\n\r\nAs we journey through Skjern and down the west coast to Esbjerg, the end\r\nof our journey, we notice the picturesque attire of the field-workers.\r\nAn old shepherd, with vivid blue shirt and sleeveless brown coat, with\r\nwhite straggling locks streaming over his shoulders, tends his few\r\nsheep. This clever old man is doing three things at once--minding his\r\nsheep, smoking his pipe, and knitting a stocking. The Danes are great\r\nknitters, men and women being equally good at it. Many girls are\r\nworking in the fields, their various coloured garments making bright\r\nspecks on the landscape. Occasionally a bullock-cart slowly drags its\r\nway across the field-road, laden with clattering milk-cans. We pass\r\nflourishing farmsteads, with storks\' nests on the roofs. The\r\nfather-stork, standing on one leg, keeping guard over his young, looks\r\npensively out over the moors, thinking, no doubt, that soon it will not\r\nbe worth his while to come all the way from Egypt to find frogs in the\r\nmarshes! For the indefatigable Dalgas has roused the dilatory Danes to\r\nsuch good purpose that soon the marshes and waste lands of Jutland will\r\nbe no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE\'S AMUSEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n"Have you been in Tivoli?" is the first question a Copenhagener would\r\nask you on your arrival in the gay capital. If not, your Danish friend\r\nwill carry you off to see these beautiful pleasure-gardens. Tivoli is\r\nfor all classes, and is the most popular place of amusement in Denmark.\r\nThis delightful summer resort is the place of all others in which to\r\nstudy the jovial side of the Danish character. Even the King and his\r\nroyal visitors occasionally pay visits, incognito, to these fascinating\r\ngardens, taking their "sixpenn\'orth of fun" with the people, whose good\r\nmanners would never allow them to take the slightest notice of their\r\nmonarch when he is enjoying himself in this way. To children Tivoli is\r\nthe ideal Sunday treat. Every taste is catered for at Tivoli, and the\r\nSaturday classical concerts have become famous, for one of the Danes\'\r\nchief pleasures is good music. Tivoli becomes fairyland when illuminated\r\nwith its myriad lights outlining the buildings and gleaming through the\r\ntrees. The light-hearted gaiety of the Dane is very infectious, and the\r\nstranger is irresistibly caught by it. The atmosphere of unalloyed\r\nmerriment which pervades when tables are spread under the trees for the\r\nalfresco supper is distinctly exhilarating. These gardens have\r\namusements for the frivolous also, such as switchbacks, pantomimes of\r\nthe "Punch and Judy" kind, and frequently firework displays, which last\r\nentertainment generally concludes the evening.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Theatre in Copenhagen is a national school of patriotism, and\r\nthe healthy spirit of its plays has an ennobling effect on the people.\r\nEverything is Danish here, and Denmark is the only small nation in\r\nEurope which has successfully founded a national dramatic art. The\r\n"Moli\xc3\xa8re of the North," Ludwig Holberg, was the father of the Danish\r\ndrama, and the first to make the people realize the beauty of their own\r\nlanguage. This gifted Dane was a great comedy-writer, and had the\r\nfaculty of making his fellows see the comic side of their follies.\r\n\r\nThe "Royal Ballet" played at this theatre is quite distinctive.\r\nBournonville, its creator, was a poet who expressed himself in motion\r\ninstead of words, and these "dumb poems" appeal strongly to the\r\nScandinavian character. This poet aimed at something more than\r\nspectacular effects upon the people: his art consisted in presenting\r\ninstructive tableaux, which, while holding the attention of his\r\naudience, taught them their traditional history. The delicate daintiness\r\nof the Danish ballet everyone must appreciate. The exquisite and\r\nintricate dances, together with the magnificent tableaux, are\r\naccompanied by wild and magical music of Danish composition.\r\nBournonville ballets represent scenes from classical mythology, as well\r\nas from ancient Scandinavian history, and the Danish people are much\r\nattached to this Northern composer of ballet. "Ei blot til Lyst"--Not\r\nonly for pleasure--is the motto over this National Theatre door, and it\r\nis in the Ballet School here that the young Danes begin their training.\r\nThese young folk take great pleasure in learning the beautiful dances,\r\nas well as in the operatic and dramatic work which they have to study,\r\nfor they must serve a certain period in this, as in any other\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nAnother place of amusement which gives pleasure to many of the poorer\r\npeople is the Working Men\'s Theatre. Actors, musicians, as well as the\r\nentire management, are all of the working classes, who are trained in\r\nthe evenings by professionals. The result is quite wonderful, and proves\r\nthe pleasure and interest these working people take in their tuition,\r\nand how their artistic abilities are developed by it. On Sundays, and\r\noccasionally in the week, a performance is given, when the working\r\nclasses crowd into the theatre to see their fellows perform. This\r\nentertainment only costs sixpence for good seats, drama and farce being\r\nthe representations most appreciated. Notwithstanding that smoking is\r\nprohibited during the performances--a rule which you would think no Dane\r\ncould tolerate, being seldom seen without pipe or cigarette--it is a\r\ngreat success, and denotes that their love of the play is greater than\r\ntheir pleasure in the weed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFARM LIFE--BUTTER-MAKING--"HEDESELSKABET"\r\n\r\n\r\nFarming in Denmark is the most important industry of the kingdom, and\r\ngives employment to half the nation. The peasant is very enlightened and\r\nadvanced in his methods; agricultural and farm products form the\r\nprincipal exports of the country. England takes the greater part of this\r\nproduce. Three or four times a week the ships leave Esbjerg--this port\r\nbeing the only Danish one not blocked by ice during some part of the\r\nwinter--for the English ports, laden with butter, bacon and eggs for the\r\nLondon market. Now, why can the Danish farmer, whose land is poorer and\r\nhis climate more severe than ours, produce so much? Education,\r\nco-operation and the help given by the State to small farmers lay the\r\nfoundation, so the Danes will tell you, of the farmer\'s prosperity. The\r\nthrift and industry of the peasant farmer is quite astonishing. He is\r\nable to bring up a large, well-educated family and live comfortably on\r\nseven or eight acres of land; whereas in England we are told that three\r\nacres will not keep a cow! The Danish farmer makes six acres keep two\r\ncows, many chickens, some pigs, himself, wife and family, and there is\r\nnever any evidence of poverty on these small farms--quite the reverse.\r\nThe farmer is strong and wiry, his wife fine and buxom, and his children\r\nsturdy, well-cared-for little urchins. All, however, must work--and work\r\nvery hard--both with head and hands to produce this splendid result. The\r\nDanish farmer grows a rapid rotation of crops for his animals, manuring\r\nheavily after each crop, and never allowing his land to lie fallow as we\r\ndo. On these small farms there is practically no grass-land; hedges and\r\nfences are unnecessary as the animals are always tethered when grazing.\r\nOmission of hedges is more economical also, making it possible to\r\ncultivate every inch of land. There is nothing wasted on a Danish farm.\r\nMany large flourishing farms also exist in Denmark, with acres of both\r\nmeadow and arable land, just as in England; but the peasant farmer is\r\nthe interesting example of the Danish system of legislation. The\r\nGovernment helps this small holder by every means in its power to become\r\na freehold farmer should he be willing and thrifty enough to try.\r\n\r\nThe typical Danish farmstead is built in the form of a square, three\r\nsides of which are occupied by the sheds for the animals, the fourth\r\nside being the dwelling-house, which is generally connected with the\r\nsheds by a covered passage--a cosy arrangement for all, as in bad\r\nweather the farmer need not go outside to attend to the animals, while\r\nthe latter benefit by the warmth from the farmhouse.\r\n\r\nThe Danes would never speak crossly to a cow or call her by other than\r\nher own name, which is generally printed on a board over her stall. The\r\ncow, in fact, is the domestic pet of the Danish farm. In the winter\r\nthese animals are taken for a daily walk wearing their winter coats of\r\njute!\r\n\r\nThese small farmers realize that "Union is Strength," and have built up\r\nfor themselves a marvellous system of co-operation. This brings the\r\nmarket literally to the door of the peasant farmer. Carts collect the\r\nfarm produce daily and transport it to the nearest factories belonging\r\nto this co-operation of farmers. At these factories the milk is turned\r\ninto delicious butter, the eggs are examined by electric light, and "Mr.\r\nPig" quickly changes his name to Bacon! These three commodities form the\r\nmost remunerative products of the farm.\r\n\r\nThe Danish farmer is a strong believer in education, thanks to the\r\nGrundtvig High-schools. Bishop Grundtvig started these schools for the\r\nbenefit of the sons and daughters of yeomen. When winter comes, and\r\noutside farm-work is at a standstill, the farmer and his family attend\r\nthese schools to learn new methods of farming and dairy-work. The\r\nfarmer\'s children are early taught to take a hand and interest\r\nthemselves in the farm-work. The son, when school is over for the day,\r\nmust help to feed the live-stock, do a bit of spade-work or\r\ncarpentering, and perhaps a little book-keeping before bedtime. These\r\npractical lessons develop in the lad a love of farm-work and a pride\r\nin helping on the family resources.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VAGT-PARADEN. LIFEGUARDS DRAWING UP OUTSIDE THE PALACE.]\r\n\r\nButter-making is an interesting sight at the splendidly equipped\r\nsteam-factories, and we all know that Danish butter is renowned for its\r\nexcellence. When the milk is weighed and tested it runs into a large\r\nreceiver, thence to the separator; from there the cream flows into the\r\nscalder, and pours over the ice frame in a rich cool stream into a\r\nwooden vat.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the separated milk has returned through a pipe to the waiting\r\nmilk-cans and is given back to the farmer, who utilizes it to feed his\r\ncalves and pigs. The cream leaves the vat for the churn through a wooden\r\nchannel, and when full the churn is set in motion. This combined churn\r\nand butter-worker completes the process of butter-making, and when the\r\ngolden mass is taken out it is ready to be packed for the English\r\nmarket. The milk, on being received at the factory, is weighed and paid\r\nfor according to weight. It takes 25 lbs. of milk to make 1 lb. of\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n"Hedeselskabet" (Heath Company) is a wonderful society started by\r\nCaptain Dalgas and other patriotic Danes, in 1866, for the purpose of\r\nreclaiming the moors and bogs. The cultivation of these lands seemed\r\nimpossible to most people, but these few enthusiasts with great energy\r\nand perseverance set to work to overcome Nature\'s obstacles. These\r\npioneers have been so successful in their efforts that in less than half\r\na century three thousand square miles of useless land in Jutland have\r\nbeen made fertile. Trees have been planted and carefully nursed into\r\ngood plantations, besides many other improvements made for the benefit\r\nof the agriculturalist and the country generally. All along the sandy\r\nwastes of the west coast of Jutland esparto grass has been sown to bind\r\nthe shifting sand, which is a danger to the crops when the terrible\r\n"Skaj"[8] blows across the land with unbroken force. Thanks to the\r\nuntiring energies of this society for reclaiming the moors, Denmark has\r\ngained land almost equal to that she lost in her beautiful province of\r\nSchleswig, annexed by Prussia in the unequal war of 1864.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Aarhus, the capital of Jutland, a handsome monument has\r\nbeen raised to the memory of Captain Dalgas, the father of the movement\r\nfor reclaiming the moors, by his grateful countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS AND SAILORS\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery Danish boy knows he must undergo a period of training as a soldier\r\nor sailor when he reaches his twentieth year. This is because Denmark is\r\nsmall and poor, and could not maintain a standing army, so her citizens\r\nmust be able to defend her when called upon. This service is required\r\nfrom all, noble and peasant alike, physical weakness alone bringing\r\nexemption. This six or twelve months\' training means a hard rough time\r\nfor young men accustomed to a refined home, but it has a pleasant side\r\nin the sympathy and friendship of comrades. The generality of conscripts\r\ndo not love their soldiering days, and look upon them as something to be\r\ngot over, like the measles! "Jens" is the Danish equivalent for "Tommy\r\nAtkins," and "Hans" is the "Jack Tar" of Denmark.\r\n\r\nTo see the daily parade of Life Guards before the royal palace is to see\r\na splendid military display. This parade the King and young Princes\r\noften watch from the palace windows. The crowd gathers to enjoy the\r\nspectacle of "Vagt-Paraden" (changing the guard) in the palace square,\r\nwhen the standard is taken from the Guard House and borne, to the\r\nstirring strains of the "Fane-Marsch," in front of the palace. As the\r\nstandard-bearer marches he throws forward his legs from the hips in the\r\nmost curious stiff way. This old elaborate German step is a striking\r\nfeature of the daily parade. When the guard is changed and the band has\r\nplayed a selection of music, the same ceremony is repeated, and the\r\nstandard deposited again in its resting-place. Then the released guard,\r\nheaded by the band playing merry tunes, march back to their barracks\r\nfollowed by an enthusiastic crowd. The fresh guard take their place\r\nbeside the sentry-boxes, which stand around the palace square. These are\r\ntall red pillar-boxes curiously like giant letter-boxes!\r\n\r\nIn the Schleswig-Holstein War of 1864, the last war Denmark was engaged\r\nin, many Danish soldiers proved their valour and heroism in the unequal\r\nencounter. These gallant men were buried in Schleswig, and as the Danish\r\ncolours were forbidden by the tyrannical Prussian conquerors, the loyal\r\nSchleswigers hit upon a pretty way of keeping the memory of their heroes\r\ngreen. The "Danebrog" was designed by a cross of white flowers on a\r\nground of red geraniums over each grave. In this way the kinsmen of\r\nthese patriots covered their last resting-place with the colours of\r\ntheir glorious national flag, under which they fell in Denmark\'s\r\ndefence. In Holmens Kirke, Copenhagen, many heroes lie buried. This\r\nbuilding, originally an iron foundry, was converted into a church by\r\nthe royal builder, Christian IV., for the dockyard men to worship in,\r\nand it is still used by them. This King\'s motto, "Piety strengthens the\r\nrealm," stands boldly over the entrance of this mortuary chapel for\r\nfamous Danes.\r\n\r\nAs Denmark is a kingdom composed mainly of islands and peninsula, she\r\nhas a long line of sea-board to defend, and a good navy is essential for\r\nher safety. The Danes being descendants of Vikings and sea-rovers, you\r\nmay be sure that their navy is well maintained.\r\n\r\nA boy who chooses the navy as his profession must leave school at the\r\nage of fourteen years, and go for nine months\' training on a warship as\r\na voluntary apprentice. At the end of this time he knows whether he\r\nlikes the profession well enough to join it--if so, two years\' coaching\r\nis given to enable him to pass the necessary examinations for entering\r\nthe Naval Academy. Here he is trained for four years, spending the four\r\nsummer months of each year in cruising. This Naval Academy, where\r\nofficers are trained, is a fine old institution, and prides itself on\r\nthe record of the famous men it has turned out. The present King of\r\nGreece, and many other members of the Danish Royal Family, have also\r\nbeen trained at this Academy. The Academy course is expensive, and as\r\npromotion is slow, and pay small in the navy, the Lieutenants are\r\nsometimes permitted to captain a ship in the merchant service for three\r\nyears. This they are glad to do, as it increases their pay and\r\nknowledge of navigation. Denmark being too small to maintain a large\r\ncruising fleet, these officers would have little opportunity of proving\r\ntheir sailing powers without this arrangement.\r\n\r\nWhen cruising, the high spirits of the young cadets sometimes lead them\r\ninto mischief, thereby bringing trouble upon their heads. I knew a naval\r\ncaptain who hit upon a very original and effective form of punishment\r\nfor wrong-doers. The cadet cap is a blue "tam-o\'-shanter" with the usual\r\nwoolly bob of the same colour on the top. "The naughty boys shall have a\r\nred bob," said the "Kaptejn," "and thus be branded for misdemeanour!"\r\nThe culprits disliked this badge intensely, I imagine mostly because\r\ntheir comrades derisively admired the colour which made them\r\nconspicuous. One day royalties were being shown over the ship, and a\r\nyoung Princess asked "why some of the boys had those pretty red tufts on\r\ntheir caps?" You may imagine the chagrin and confusion of the culprits;\r\nscarlet faces and crimson tufts told their own tale! The boys, you may\r\nbe sure, thought twice in future before risking another penitential week\r\nof branding and ridicule for breach of discipline.\r\n\r\nIn Copenhagen one of the discarded warships is used as public restaurant\r\nand training-school for ships\' cooks. Here the sailor-men are taught\r\nevery branch of cooking and kitchen-work. When trained, these cooks are\r\nemployed on the merchant-ships, as well as on the men-of-war.\r\n\r\nSome interesting stories are told of the naval heroes of Denmark which\r\nyou will like to hear. Peder Tordenskjold is the Nelson of Denmark. This\r\nman, besides being a great Admiral, was a most genial character, and had\r\na striking and original personality. Many true tales are told about this\r\nhero which the young Danish lads never tire of hearing. There is a\r\nfavourite one which tells of the ingenious way by which he discovered\r\nthe weak points in his enemy\'s stronghold. Dressing himself as a\r\nfisherman, he accompanied two other fishers in a little rowing-boat\r\nladen with fish to the enemy\'s shores. Taking a basket of fish, he\r\nmounted the hill to the fort, saying he had brought the fish for the\r\ncommandant. He was allowed to pass in to the fort with his fish, and,\r\npretending stupidity, kept losing his way--gaining knowledge\r\nthereby--till he reached the commandant\'s residence. Gaining permission\r\nfrom the latter to supply the garrison with fish, he inquired for how\r\nmany men he should provide. "Let me see," said the commandant, half to\r\nhimself, "a hundred guns--two hundred men; you may bring fish for a\r\nhundred men." Tordenskjold then left the fort, having obtained all the\r\ninformation he required, and returned to his boat. At this moment the\r\ncaptain of one of the ships lying in the bay arrived on shore, and the\r\npretended fisherman at once accosted him, asking permission to serve his\r\nmen with fish. This being granted, he at once rowed to the ship, where\r\nhe soon disposed of his fish, and conversing with the sailors, he\r\ngained the information that in two days\' time there would be a great\r\nfestivity held on shore, at which most of them would be present. With\r\nthis valuable knowledge he returned to his own shore from the Swedish\r\ncoast, and laid plans which gave Denmark a victory and proved fatal to\r\nthe Swedes. In Holmens Kirke, where this hero lies buried, a splendid\r\nblack marble tomb has been erected to his memory by King Frederik IV.\r\nNear by lies another naval hero, Niels Juel, whose gilt and copper\r\ncoffin is surmounted by a tablet which tells of his brave deeds.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hvitfeldt, the hero of Kj\xc3\xb6ge Bay, blew up his ship with three\r\nhundred men to save the Danish fleet from destruction. In the war of\r\n1710, between Denmark and Sweden, this captain\'s ship, the _Danebrog_,\r\ntook fire. To save the ships which were being driven by the wind towards\r\nhis burning vessel, he and his gallant crew sacrificed their lives.\r\n\r\nHerluf Trolle was a Danish noble and a famous Admiral, who left all his\r\nwealth to found a school for orphans. His noble wife, Fru Bergitta, was\r\ngreatly distressed that the Admiral\'s will could not be found, as she\r\nwas most anxious that his wishes, which were also her own, with regard\r\nto the school, should be carried into effect. The Admiral\'s relatives\r\nwould inherit the property, and were already clamouring for it, when one\r\nnight Fru Bergitta had a dream. She dreamed she saw someone walking\r\nround her husband\'s writing-table, attentively inspecting the legs.\r\nThese she examined on awakening, and found one to be hollow.\r\nDiscovering a secret spring, she pressed it, and beheld the will lying\r\nin the hollow space. So Herluf Trolle\'s school was founded, and although\r\nthis brave old Admiral died from wounds received in battle centuries\r\nago, yet his school is considered to be one of the best at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUNDAY IN THE ISLAND OF L\xc3\x86S\xc3\x96.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE ISLES\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most storm-swept and barren of Denmark\'s many islands is the\r\nisland of Fan\xc3\xb6. Lying, as it does, exposed to the full force of the\r\nNorth Sea gales, it yet serves to protect the harbour of Esbjerg from\r\nthese storms. It is eight miles long, and three miles at its broadest\r\npart. A trim little steamer will carry you across from Esbjerg to\r\nNordby--the fishing town on the east coast of Fan\xc3\xb6--in twenty minutes.\r\nNordby is both quaint and picturesque. The low thatched houses, with\r\nrough-cast, whitewashed walls, nestle close to each other for shelter\r\nfrom the winds.\r\n\r\nThe Fan\xc3\xb6 women have a practical but peculiar costume; the\r\nthickly-pleated skirt has a bright-coloured border, while the\r\nclose-fitting bodice is adorned with embroidery, and pretty antique\r\nbuttons. A folded cotton kerchief and accordion-pleated apron give a\r\ndaintiness to the whole dress. The head-dress, however, gives the most\r\nsingular finish to the costume. A dark, checked-bordered handkerchief\r\ntied over a stiff, cambric frame, entirely envelops the head. The four\r\nends of this handkerchief are tied in an odd way, two being left\r\nupstanding like rabbits\' ears! This striking head-dress gives the Fan\xc3\xb6\r\nwife a fantastic appearance. When the good-natured, smiling faces of\r\nthese women are hidden behind a mask, the combination of dress and mask\r\nmakes them awesome-looking folk. The men of the island are nearly all\r\nfishermen; the women are the farmers, and it is to protect their faces\r\nfrom the blinding sand-storms, while working on the land, that these\r\nmasks are worn. This mask obliterates all comeliness, for only the eyes\r\npeep out from the weird face-protector.\r\n\r\nThis island of heath, dune, and quicksand is wild and romantic. The\r\ncultivated fields are protected by sand-hills, and belts of stunted,\r\nwind-swept trees that afford some slight protection to the crops. The\r\nisland belongs to the people, who cultivate it assiduously. The courage\r\nand perseverance of these women agriculturalists is rewarded by fair\r\ncrops, notwithstanding an adverse climate.\r\n\r\nAt the south end of the island, far away from any dwelling, is the\r\ninteresting "Fuglek\xc3\xb6jerne,"[9] where three or four hundred wild-duck are\r\ntaken in a day during the season. Decoy-ducks are used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe west side of the island is the most fashionable watering-place in\r\nDenmark. Large hotels and pretty villas line the shore, and here the\r\nwell-to-do Danes inhale bracing sea-breezes.\r\n\r\nOn a windy day this western shore is not amusing. Clouds of blinding\r\nsand whirl high in the air, while the booming surf rolls and plunges on\r\nthe beach with deafening roar, and makes rank and fashion fly to shelter\r\nin hotel or villa till the storm is over. Visitors in summer and storms\r\nin winter have it all their own way on this west coast--the people of\r\nFan\xc3\xb6 trouble it not.\r\n\r\nBornholm, situated in the middle of the Baltic, is both beautiful and\r\nfertile. Its products are very valuable to Denmark. From here comes the\r\nclay of which the exquisite Copenhagen porcelain is made. Here, too, the\r\ngranite for building the country\'s defences and docks is quarried. I\r\nfancy if you were to ask a young Dane what Bornholm is most famed for he\r\nwould say, "Turkeys," for the island supplies the Copenhagen market with\r\nthese birds.\r\n\r\nThe chief town, R\xc3\xb6nne, is charming, with its many low-roofed houses,\r\nwhich overlook the Baltic. It is noted for its terra-cotta ware, clocks,\r\nand Museum of Antiquities.\r\n\r\nMost of the towns are upon the coast. Four singular round churches,\r\nbuilt of granite, were formerly used as places of refuge for the people\r\nwhen beset by pirates. These "Rundkirker" are peculiar to Bornholm.\r\n\r\nA high festival is celebrated every year on the anniversary of the day\r\nwhen the inhabitants succeeded in throwing off the Swedish yoke, which\r\nthey had borne for a short time in the seventeenth century with\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\nHammershus Castle, on the northern extremity of Bornholm, was built in\r\nthe thirteenth century. There is a sad tale connected with this romantic\r\ncastle, about a Danish noble and his wife. This noble, Corfitz Ulfeldt,\r\nwas imprisoned there for treason. His beautiful wife, Eleonora, the\r\nfavourite daughter of Christian IV., accompanied him, preferring\r\nimprisonment with him to liberty without him. After the Count died,\r\nEleonora, who had a mortal enemy in Queen Caroline Amalia, was sent by\r\nthe latter to the "Blaataarn"[10] of Slotsholmen, Copenhagen, and there\r\nincarcerated for twenty-two years. The illustrious Eleonora was only\r\nliberated on the death of the vindictive Queen, but the long years of\r\ncaptivity--without reason--had wrecked her life.\r\n\r\nL\xc3\xa6s\xc3\xb6 is a small island in the Cattegat, the inhabitants of which are\r\nmainly farmers and fishermen, and the old women wear a particular\r\ncostume for Sunday, which is called the "church costume."\r\n\r\nThe people of Amager are great market-gardeners. They are of Dutch\r\nextraction. Christian II., after flying from his country, took refuge in\r\nHolland, and some of the Dutch helped him in trying to regain his\r\nthrone. For this service he gave his Dutch followers the island of\r\nAmager. The descendants of these Dutch people still retain their old\r\ncustoms and characteristics. Clattering about in wooden shoes, the old\r\nwomen, in quaint costume, may be seen driving their geese down the\r\npicturesque streets to the meadows. Besides being market-gardeners and\r\nflorists, these Amager folk rear and fatten the geese for the Christmas\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe natural beauty of the island of M\xc3\xb6en is striking, and unlike the\r\nrest of Denmark. "M\xc3\xb6en\'s Klint" are great, jagged white cliffs rising\r\nabruptly from the sea. Enchanting beech-woods thickly crown the summit,\r\ngiving distinctive and unusual beauty to it. From Sommerspiret, the\r\nhighest point, we have an extensive view over the \xc3\x98sters\xc3\xb6en and K\xc3\xb6jge\r\nBay, where the famous victory over the Swedes was won by Niels Juel in\r\n1677.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark the town-crier beats a drum to draw attention to the notice\r\nhe is about to give.\r\n\r\nDanish postmen present a gorgeous appearance, in red coats, with smart\r\ncloaks of the same brilliant hue for winter wear. These and the bright\r\nyellow mail-vans, which they drive sometimes, arrest attention, and give\r\nimportance to the carriers of His Majesty\'s mails.\r\n\r\nIn many of the houses the "Forh\xc3\xb6jning" is still used. This is a raised\r\nplatform close to the window, on which the lady of the house sits to do\r\nher embroidery. While she is here she can follow all that goes on in the\r\nstreet below by an ingenious arrangement of oblique convex mirrors fixed\r\nto the outside of the window, and reflecting the life in the streets\r\nboth ways.\r\n\r\nThe numerous pretty articles made of amber, which adorn the ladies\'\r\ndressing-tables, and of which beads and ornaments for the girls are\r\ncomposed, are of local manufacture, amber being found in quantities on\r\nthe west coast of Jutland.\r\n\r\nIn the islands of Funen and Seeland there are many grand old\r\nmanor-houses belonging to the nobility, whose fine estates give\r\nemployment to many peasants. A story is told of a certain noble,\r\nChristian Barnekow by name, who saved his King, Christian IV., by his\r\nheroic self-sacrifice. The King had lost his horse, and was on the point\r\nof being killed or made prisoner when Barnekow came to his rescue.\r\nGiving the King his own horse, he said, "I give my horse to my King, my\r\nlife to the enemy, and my soul to God." A street in Copenhagen is called\r\nafter this brave nobleman "Kristenbernikovstrade."\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of the Danes to run words into each other, and\r\nstreets in Denmark often have prodigiously long names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFISHERMEN AT HOME AND AFLOAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe class of people most lauded by their own and other nations is that\r\nof the brave and hardy fishermen of Denmark. These men are always\r\nwilling to man the life-boat and to risk their lives to save those in\r\nperil on the dangerous coast of Jutland. Although hundreds of ships are\r\nwrecked on this dreaded "Jernkyst" (iron coast), their crews are\r\ninvariably saved by these courageous men. The whole length of the west\r\ncoast of Jutland is bleak and exposed to the storms and fogs of the\r\nNorth Sea. Not one single harbour of refuge can be found between Esbjerg\r\nand the Skaw. Dangerous sandbanks and massive cliffs guard the coast,\r\nmaking navigation both difficult and hazardous. All along this perilous\r\ncoast life-saving apparatus of the newest and best type is stored in the\r\nlife-boat houses placed at intervals close to the seashore. On stormy\r\nnights the watching sentinels summon by telephone the fishermen of the\r\ntiny hamlets near. At sound of a rocket the distressful cry, "A wreck, a\r\nwreck!" runs over the telephone, and immediately brave hearts and hands\r\nare putting off to the rescue, while trembling women anxiously wait\r\ntheir husbands\' return with warm restoratives for the saved. These\r\nfishermen\'s wives are brave too, for it is anxious work waiting and\r\nwatching. It is not to be wondered at that this merciless and cruel\r\ncoast is dreaded by all seamen. How thankful they must feel when they\r\nsee the great lighthouse at Grenen--the northernmost point of\r\nJutland--and can signal "All\'s well!" "Alt vel! passeret Grenen" flash\r\nthe lights across the water, and both passengers and crew breathe a\r\nlittle more freely if it has been a stormy passage. Something like\r\neighty thousand vessels pass by this coast in a year, so you may be sure\r\nthe gallant fishermen of Denmark who live on the iron coast have plenty\r\nof rescue work to do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKAGEN FISHERMAN NEAR THE TOWER OF BURIED CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nYou should see this coast on a stormy day, more especially at Grenen,\r\nwhere those two mighty seas, the Skagerack and Cattegat, meet. When the\r\ntempest rages here, far as eye can see a long ridge of seething, tossing\r\nwater denotes the meeting-place of the currents. The great "white\r\nhorses" in battle array fight, plunge, and roar--each striving for the\r\nmastery which neither gains. This wrestling-match is a splendid\r\nspectacle to those who are safe on shore, also to those at sea if the\r\nday is clear, because they can then give the reef a wide berth. Tossing\r\nspray is thrown high into the air and wind-borne to the shore, so even\r\nat a distance from the waves you may have a salt shower-bath should you\r\nbe able to "keep your legs" against the fury of the gale. The screaming\r\ngulls which fly around, dipping and rising, enjoying as only\r\n"storm-birds" can the roar and tumult of these tempestuous waters,\r\nenhance the fierce loneliness of the scene. This awe-inspiring\r\n"Nature-barrier" saddens you--even while you exult in the madness of its\r\nfury--when you think what it means on a foggy night to the poor mariner.\r\nWhat a comfort for the seafarer to know that there is such a famous race\r\nof fishermen here, willing and ready to man the life-boat and rescue\r\nthem from the angry, engulfing waters! You would never guess these seas\r\ncould be otherwise than kind when you enter their smiling depths for a\r\nswim on a calm, sunny day. How gentle and invigorating they can be the\r\nfishermen as well as the visitors know, and any morning you may see the\r\nformer returning from their daily dip with dripping heads and towels\r\nalong the shore. Somehow these fishermen are always picturesque. In the\r\nsummer evening, sitting or lying on the sunlit beach, smoking their\r\ncutty-pipes and waiting for the time to launch their boats for the\r\nfishing, they make an impressive picture. Kindly blue eyes and\r\nweather-beaten faces look at you from under the sou\'westers, while blue\r\njerseys, long sea-boots with curled-over tops and oil-skins, complete\r\nthe sea-going outfit. Fully equipped, they charm the eye of the most\r\nfastidious, and it is little wonder that they have become subjects for\r\nfamous artists and poets.\r\n\r\nThese fishermen are very devout, and before launching their boat they\r\nall stand round it with clasped hands and bowed heads, offering up a\r\nshort, silent prayer for help and protection on these dangerous waters.\r\nThen, pushing the boat out into the water, they jump in while it\r\nfloats--sea-boots getting wet in the process--and wave farewell to their\r\nchildren on the shore, who cry in return "Farvel Fa\'er!"\r\n\r\nLars Kruse, the late captain of the life-boat at Skagen, has had a\r\nbeautiful monument raised to his memory, and his son will show you with\r\ngreat pride the cups and medals he left behind as mementoes of his brave\r\ndeeds. These medals have been presented by many different nations whose\r\nsea-farers have been saved by him. Amongst these is one given by Queen\r\nVictoria.\r\n\r\nCaptain Larsen, a well-known mariner, who, on retiring from his post on\r\none of the light-ships, settled at Old Skagen, has left a unique\r\ncollection to the village. This now constitutes a museum of exquisitely\r\ncarved furniture, much of it inlaid with ivory, marbles and metals in\r\ndainty designs, all made by this old sailor during the last twelve years\r\nof his life--a wonderful record of industry. Old Skagen is a quaint\r\nfisher-village, nestling behind the sand-dunes, trying to shelter itself\r\nfrom the sand and sea-storms to which these shores are subjected.\r\n\r\nMany of these fisher-folk are farmers also, tilling and cultivating the\r\nheath-lands which lie beyond the village. The fisher cottages are quite\r\npretty, with thatched or red-tiled roofs, white or buff rough-cast\r\nwalls, green painted doors and windows, with black painted foundations\r\nwhich protect them from the sand. Bright flowering plants in the windows\r\nand the neat and clean appearance of the whole betoken the joy and\r\ncomfort that reigns in the fisherman\'s home. Many household duties are\r\nperformed at the cottage door in the sandy enclosure surrounding the\r\nlittle homestead. Here the old men mend the nets, keeping a watchful eye\r\non the babies, while the women clean and salt the fish, hanging them up\r\nin rows to dry in the sun. In these garden enclosures, also, many\r\nquaintly pretty miniature houses may be seen erected on tall poles.\r\nThese are to encourage the starlings and other songsters to settle in\r\nthem, as there are no trees. Hen-roosts and outhouses are adorned with\r\nthe name-boards of wrecked boats washed up on the shore, while discarded\r\nboats turned over and tarred make the roofs of these curious shelters\r\nworthy of royal hens!\r\n\r\nThe older fishermen have a safe and effective way of trawling from the\r\nstrand. Putting out in a small boat, taking their net with them, to\r\nwhich a long rope is attached--the end of this being left in charge of\r\nthe fishermen on the shore--they row gaily over the water, paying out\r\nthe rope as they go. When the limit of this rope is reached, the men\r\ndrop their weighted net overboard and pull for the shore, bringing with\r\nthem another attached rope which is paid out till they reach the strand.\r\nWhen they have landed and the boat is beached, half a dozen men or more\r\ntake hold of each rope--these are fastened to each side of the\r\nsubmerged net--and begin hauling it to the shore. The straining muscles\r\nof the men as they march up the beach with a strong, steady, overhand\r\npull on the rope denotes that this is heavy work. It is a grand sight!\r\nAs the net nears the shore the gleaming, glittering mass of fish can be\r\nseen leaping and jumping in vain endeavour to escape from their prison,\r\nonly the smaller fry succeeding. At last the net with its silver load\r\nreaches the shore with the noise as of a great wave breaking upon the\r\nbeach, which is caused by the efforts of the fish to gain their freedom.\r\nThe best fish are picked out and the others returned to the sea, while\r\nthe gulls swoop down with querulous cry and gobble all that float on the\r\nsurface of the water. These fishermen have a prejudice against skate,\r\nand use it only for bait.\r\n\r\nSt. Clement is the patron saint of Danish fishermen, and many of the\r\nchurches in the coast towns are dedicated to him.\r\n\r\nAs the Cathedral of Aarhus is dedicated to St. Clement, the Skaw\r\nfishermen have given an exquisite model of a ship to the church. This\r\nship is a perfect representation in miniature of a man-of-war. It was\r\nmade in Holland for Peter the Great, but the ship which carried it was\r\nwrecked near Grenen, and the model was saved by the Skaw fishermen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nYOUTHFUL DANES AT WORK AND PLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nDenmark is renowned for its educational system and for its schools.\r\nThese schools are all under Government control, and meet the wants of\r\nevery class. The authorities are upheld by the parents, both being\r\ndetermined there shall be no such thing as an ignoramus in Denmark, so\r\nwhether the children are educated at home or sent to school, they must\r\nbegin lessons at the age of seven. If they have a governess at home the\r\nparents must give a guarantee to the authorities that the governess is\r\nefficient and capable of giving the standard education to the children.\r\nShould parents elect to take their children abroad during the school\r\nterm, they must notify their intention, undertaking that a teacher shall\r\naccompany them and lessons continue while away. Shirking lessons is\r\nquite an impossibility for little Danes, as everybody thinks that\r\neducation comes before all else, so parents do not encourage idleness or\r\nextra holidays during the school year.\r\n\r\nSchool attendance is compulsory for all children between the ages of\r\nseven and fourteen. The hours are not long nor wearisome, as the lessons\r\nare arranged with a view to holding the attention of young minds during\r\nthe period of instruction. The classes are small, even in the free\r\nschools, never more than thirty-five pupils to a teacher, and generally\r\nless. The lesson lasts forty minutes, and then there is an interval for\r\nplay. The thorough education of the pupils for their future work in life\r\nis considered, so lessons in writing, reading, and arithmetic, in the\r\nKommune schools, are varied by tailoring lessons for boys, and cookery\r\nfor girls, after they are ten years of age. At every school gymnastics\r\nplay an important part--pleasant lessons these are for all--but perhaps\r\nthe lesson the boys most delight in is their instruction in Sl\xc3\xb6yd. Each\r\nlad has his carpenter\'s bench with necessary tools, and as we know every\r\nboy is happy when making or marring with hammer and nails, I am sure you\r\nwill think these must be enviable lessons. I have seen some charming\r\nmodels as well as useful things made by the boys--a perfect miniature\r\nlandau, complete in every detail, benches, bureaux, carts, tables,\r\nchairs, besides many other serviceable articles. Besides this\r\npleasure-work at school, the boys, if they are farmers\' sons, have\r\npractical lessons at home by helping their father on the farm. The\r\nauthorities being anxious to help the farmer, they allow him to keep a\r\nboy at home half the day for instruction in farm-work, but the other\r\nhalf must be spent at school. The prizes at the municipal schools not\r\ninfrequently consist of clothes, watches, clocks, or tools, all of which\r\nare worked for eagerly by the pupils.\r\n\r\nThe boys and girls of Denmark begin early with gymnastic exercises, and\r\nsoon become sturdy little athletes from sheer love of the exhilarating\r\npractice. All Danes pride themselves--and with good reason--on their\r\nnational athletic exercises. At the Olympic Games, held at the Stadium\r\nin London, the Danish ladies carried away the gold medal by their fine\r\ngymnastic display. This was a triumph with so many competitors in the\r\nfield. It is an amusing sight to see the Danes at a seaside resort\r\ntaking their morning swim; each one on leaving the water runs about on\r\nthe sun-warmed beach, and goes through a gymnastic display on his own\r\naccount, choosing the exercise he considers most calculated to warm and\r\ninvigorate him after his dip. The children require no second bidding to\r\nfollow father\'s example, and as they emerge from the water breathless,\r\npantingly join in the fun. Sons try to go one better than the father in\r\nsome gymnastic feat which the latter\'s stoutness renders impossible! The\r\nmerry peals of laughter which accompany the display speak eloquently of\r\nthe thorough enjoyment of all the bathers.\r\n\r\nYachting in Denmark is not merely a pleasure for the rich, it is\r\ninexpensive, so all classes and every man capable of sailing a boat can\r\nenjoy it. In the summer-time the Sound and other waters seem alive with\r\nthe multitudes of white sails and speeding craft of all sizes. The\r\n\xc3\x98resund Week, as the Royal Yacht Club\'s regatta-week is called, is the\r\ntime of all others for yachtsmen to display their skill, and a gay\r\nevent in the Copenhagener\'s year. The pleasant waters of Denmark are\r\nbeloved of yachtsmen. Sailing round the wooded islands, you are\r\nimpressed by their picturesque beauty, which is seen to advantage from\r\nthe water. One is not surprised that this popular pastime comes first\r\nwith every Danish boy, who, whether swimming, rowing, or sailing, feels\r\nperfectly at home on the water. Everybody cycles in Denmark.\r\nCycle-stands are provided outside every shop, station, office, and\r\ncollege, so that you have no more difficulty in disposing of your cycle\r\nthan your umbrella.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINTER IN THE FOREST.]\r\n\r\nFootball is a summer game here--spirited matches you would think\r\nimpossible at this season--but the Danes have them, and what is more,\r\nthey will inform you that they quite enjoy what appears to the spectator\r\na hot, fatiguing amusement. Cricket has few attractions for the Danish\r\nlads, but that is because they cannot play, though their schoolmasters\r\nand parents would have them try. All things English are much admired,\r\nand when a Dane intends to do a thing he generally succeeds, so we can\r\nonly suppose he is too indifferent about cricket--although it is an\r\nEnglish game--to excel.\r\n\r\nGolf and hockey are also played, and "bandy"--_i.e._, hockey on the\r\nice--is a favourite winter sport. A "bandy" match is quite exciting to\r\nwatch. The players, armed with a wooden club, often find the ice a\r\ndifficulty when rushing after the solid rubber ball. This exhilarating\r\ngame is known in some parts of the world as "shinty." The Danes are\r\nproficient skaters, and of late years an artificial ground for winter\r\nsport of all kinds has been made in the Ulvedal, near Copenhagen. Here\r\nthey have "bandy" matches, ski-ing, and tobogganing, as well as other\r\nwinter games. Fox-hunting is unknown in Denmark, but frequently foxes\r\nare included in the sportsman\'s bag when shooting. These are shot\r\nbecause it is necessary to keep Mr. Reynard\'s depredations under\r\ncontrol. Trotting-matches are held on Sunday on the racecourse near\r\nCharlottenlund, and horse-racing takes place too. Lawn-tennis and\r\ncroquet are very popular, but the latter is the favourite pastime of the\r\nDanish ladies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nINGEBORG\'S JOURNEY THROUGH SEELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nFunen, the island which lies between the Great and Little Belts, is\r\nknown as the "Garden of Denmark," on account of its beauty and\r\nfertility. In Odense, the capital, Ingeborg had lived happily all the\r\nfifteen summers of her life. Now she was to have an unexpected treat.\r\nHer grandfather intended taking her with him on the morrow to see some\r\nof the historical places in Seeland. Ingeborg loved history, and had\r\ngiven her grandfather much pleasure by the knowledge she displayed when\r\nshowing him over her own church, St. Knud\'s. This ancient Gothic Church\r\nis the finest specimen of medi\xc3\xa6val architecture in Denmark. St. Knud,\r\nthe grand-nephew of Canute the Great, was slain before the altar while\r\npraying for his people. This brave King could have saved himself by\r\nflight, but would not, lest his subjects should suffer at the hands of\r\nhis enemies. He was canonized by the Pope, and his brother built the\r\nchurch to his memory. Besides being the shrine of St. Knud, this church\r\nis the burial-place of King Christian II. and his Queen, as well as of\r\nKing Hans and his Consort. The beautiful altar-piece, given by Queen\r\nChristina, is of the most exquisite workmanship, and took the artists\r\nmany years to execute.\r\n\r\nIngeborg\'s excitement was great when she crossed from Nyborg. She\r\nremembered that an army once crossed this water on foot, so severe was\r\nthe winter, and that ice-breakers are still used occasionally. The girl\r\nwished it was winter as she watched for the first time the huge\r\npaddle-wheels of the steam-ferry ploughing through the waters of the\r\nGreat Belt. By the time Kors\xc3\xb6r was reached, Herr Nielsen, her\r\ngrandfather, had made acquaintance with a student who was returning to\r\nhis college at Sor\xc3\xb6, the town which they intended making their first\r\nstopping-place. The student, whose name was Hans, informed them that he\r\nlived at Ribe, a quaint old town of South Jutland, left very much to\r\nmemories and the storks, but possessing a fine twelfth-century\r\nCathedral. The college at Sor\xc3\xb6 was founded by Ludvig Holberg, the father\r\nof Danish comedy, who left his fortune and library for that purpose.\r\nHans was proud of belonging to this college, as it had educated many men\r\nof letters famous in Danish history.\r\n\r\nIn the Cistercian Church of Sor\xc3\xb6, Bishop Absalon, the founder of\r\nCopenhagen, lies buried. It is said that this Bishop\'s spirit appears,\r\nwith menacing attitude, if anyone desecrates the place by irreverence.\r\nLudvig Holberg is also buried in this cloister church, as well as three\r\nDanish Kings.\r\n\r\nIngemann the poet spent most of his time at this charming town, which\r\nstands on the lake of the Sor\xc3\xb6 S\xc3\xb6. In the luxuriant beech-woods which\r\nsurround the lake, Saxo Grammaticus, the first historian of Denmark, was\r\nwont to wander. Both these celebrated men also lie in the old church,\r\nwhich Ingeborg felt was a fitting resting-place for the noble dead.\r\n\r\nOn the advice of Hans, Herr Nielsen took his young grand-daughter to see\r\nthe old convent church of Ringsted. Here many Danish Kings were buried\r\nin the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The interesting\r\nRomanesque Church of Kallundborg was also visited. This Church, with its\r\nfour octagonal towers and a square tower in the middle, forms a Greek\r\ncross. This is the most unique specimen of medi\xc3\xa6val architecture in the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nIngeborg had long looked forward to seeing Roskilde Cathedral, and the\r\nday was bright and sunny when they arrived at the sleepy little town on\r\nthe Roskilde Fjord. This stately Cathedral, with its two tall pointed\r\nspires, is called the "Westminster Abbey" of Denmark. It is the\r\nburial-place of the Danish Royal Family: thirty-three Kings and many\r\nQueens rest in it. A beautiful alabaster tomb marks the resting-place of\r\nQueen Margrethe, the famous Queen who united the three Crowns--Norway,\r\nSweden, and Denmark--and was ever ambitious for the glory and\r\ndevelopment of these countries. She ruled with wisdom and wonderful\r\ndiplomacy, and was the most powerful Queen Denmark ever had. She has\r\nbeen called the "Semiramis of the North." Though the three crowns are\r\nstill on the shield of Denmark, the other two kingdoms were lost to her\r\nin the sixteenth century. Queen Margrethe was the daughter of Valdemar\r\nIV., known as "Atterdag," because of his favourite proverb: "I Morgen er\r\nder atter en Dag."[11] This powerful monarch kept his subjects in such\r\nincessant turmoil by his numerous wars for acquiring territory "that\r\nthey had not time to eat"! The Renaissance chapel erected by Christian\r\nIV., in which his tomb stands, is very beautiful. This popular monarch,\r\nalike celebrated as architect, sailor, and warrior, was one of the most\r\nimpressive figures in Danish history. The mural paintings of the chapel\r\nrepresent scenes in the life of this great King.\r\n\r\nIngeborg was glad she remembered her history, and could tell her\r\ngrandfather so much as they went through the Cathedral. He, however,\r\ninformed her that Frederik VII. was the last of the Kings of the\r\nOldenburg line, which had been on the throne of Denmark for over four\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nThe sarcophagus of the beloved Christian IX., father of many European\r\ncrowned heads, including Queen Alexandra of England, is still kept\r\ncovered with fresh flowers. This King, whose memory is so revered in all\r\ncountries, inaugurated a new dynasty in Denmark. The curious old clock\r\nat the western end of the cathedral interested Ingeborg, and she watched\r\nwith delight, when it struck the hour of noon, St. George, mounted on\r\nhis fiery steed, with many groans and stiff, jerky movements, kill the\r\ndragon, which expired with a gruesome death-rattle!\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century this quiet town of Roskilde was the capital,\r\nand the archiepiscopal see of Denmark. An English Bishop, William of\r\nRoskilde, is supposed to have built the Cathedral.\r\n\r\nWe will now follow our little friend and her grandfather to\r\nFrederiksborg Castle. The castle, with its many towers and pinnacles\r\nreflected in still waters, stands in the middle of a lake. This handsome\r\nDutch Renaissance building is now used as an historical museum. Many of\r\nthe Danish Kings have been crowned in its magnificent chapel. Wandering\r\nthrough the splendid rooms of the castle, Ingeborg could read the\r\nhistory of her country in a very pleasant and interesting manner. The\r\ncollection being confined to one period for each room made instruction\r\nan easy affair for the grandfather. Beginning with King Gorm the Old and\r\nCanute the Great, it comprises all periods up to the last century.\r\n\r\nThe autumn residence of the Royal Family, Fredensborg Castle, was the\r\nnext place of interest visited. This Castle of Peace was built to\r\ncommemorate the end of the war between Denmark and Sweden. "Fred" means\r\n"peace" in Danish, and, indeed, this place proves a home of peace to\r\ntired Royalty. Its park is considered the most beautiful in Denmark. The\r\nmagnificent avenues of lime-trees are lined by marble statues of\r\npeasants in national costumes, Faroese, Icelandic and Norwegian, as well\r\nas those of Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe Open-Air Museum at Lyngby, with its ancient farm and peasant\r\nbuildings, the interiors of which are fitted up just as they used to be,\r\ngave Ingeborg a peep into the past and old-time Denmark. Here she saw a\r\ncurious rolling-pin hanging in the ingle-nook of the farmhouse from the\r\nvillage of Ostenfeld. This wooden pin, so her grandfather told her, was\r\na Clogg Almanac or Runic Calendar. It had four sides, each marking three\r\nmonths, large notches denoting Sundays, small ones showing week-days.\r\nSaints\' days were marked by the symbol of each saint. He had seen some\r\nof these old calendars in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, when he had\r\nbeen in England, which were relics of Danish government there. These\r\nquaint and curious Clogg Almanacs were used throughout Scandinavia,\r\nsmall ones made of horn or bone being for the pocket.\r\n\r\nBut here we must say good-bye to Ingeborg and her grandfather, as after\r\nseeing Kronborg Castle and Elsinore they will return by the beautiful\r\ncoast-line to Copenhagen, there to enjoy many of the sights we have seen\r\nin "dear little Denmark."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Thank you for the food.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: May it agree with you.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Spoon-food.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Luncheon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Be so good.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Birthday child.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Impenetrable swamp.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The sharp, dry, north-west wind which blows in the spring.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Retreat of wild-duck.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Blue Tower.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: To-morrow comes another day.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DENMARK***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 20107-8.txt or 20107-8.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/0/1/0/20107\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
