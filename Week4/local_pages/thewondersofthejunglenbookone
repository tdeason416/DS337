Hence natural history should be\r\ntaught to a child from an early age.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best method of teaching it is to set forth the\r\ncharacteristics of animals in the form of a narrative. Then the child\r\nreads the narrative with pleasure and almost as a story, not as a\r\ntedious "lesson."\r\n\r\nI have followed that method in the Wonders of the Jungle. The present\r\nwork (Book One) is intended to be a supplementary reader for the\r\nearlier grades in grammar schools. If it be found useful, I shall\r\nwrite one or two more books in progressive order for the use of higher\r\ngrades.\r\n\r\nIn Book One I have depicted only such wild animals as appeal to the\r\ninterest of young children, and even to their sympathy and love. In\r\nsubsequent books I shall describe the animals that prey upon others.\r\nAs those animals are not lovable, it would be better for the child to\r\nread about them a year or two later. But even to those animals I shall\r\nbe just, and shall depict their good qualities as well as their\r\npreying habits. How many people know that the very worst animal, the\r\ntiger, is a better husband and father than many men? Or that the\r\nferocity of the tigress is prompted entirely by her maternal\r\ninstinct--and that in every case of unusual ferocity yet recorded it\r\nwas afterward found that there was a helpless cub somewhere near?\r\nHence in subsequent books I shall enter more fully into the causes of\r\nanimal instincts and characteristics--their loves and their hates and\r\ntheir fears.\r\n\r\nRegarding the scheme of Book One, the animals are described in their\r\ndaily life, and the main scientific facts and principles concerning\r\neach animal are woven into the narrative as a part of that daily life.\r\nBut while teaching science to the child in that pleasant form, a few\r\nother purposes have also been kept in view:--\r\n\r\n1. To cultivate the child\'s imagination. True imagination is the\r\nability to visualize mentally the realities of life, not what is\r\nunreal--for which it is so often mistaken. Hence in this book the\r\nchild is helped to visualize the animals in their actual haunts, and\r\nto see each incident as it actually happens.\r\n\r\n2. To cultivate the child\'s reasoning faculty. The child is encouraged\r\nat every step to think and to reason why the animal does certain\r\nthings; _e.g._ why the elephant does not drink directly with its\r\nmouth, but has to squirt the water into it with the trunk.\r\n\r\n3. To teach a moral from the study of animals. The whole of Creation\r\nis one immense and beautiful pattern: so the child may well be trained\r\nto see the pattern in this also. And as a practical benefit from the\r\nstudy of animals, the child may learn thereby the value of certain\r\nqualities, such as obedience, discipline, and good citizenship--_e.g._\r\nas in the remarkable case of the elephant, the buffalo, and the\r\nflamingo, as described in the text. In this regard I have kept in mind\r\nthe very useful suggestions formulated a few years ago by the Moral\r\nEducation League of Great Britain, under the patronage of Queen Mary,\r\nfive of whose children at that time ranged in age from seven to\r\nfifteen. One of the functions of education is to present to the child\r\nthe noblest and the most elevated of ideals. I have sought to do that\r\nin almost every chapter.\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge my obligation to the New York Kindergarten\r\nAssociation for its valuable cooperation in putting this book through\r\na practical test. The Kindergarten Association on more than one\r\noccasion provided me with a large audience of children, ranging in age\r\nfrom six to nine, ex-pupils of the Association, who are now in the\r\npublic schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\nI.

You\r\nhave seen many animals in the zoo or in a circus--elephants, bears,\r\nlions, tigers, leopards, and many others. But the jungle is the place\r\nwhere these animals live before they are brought to the zoo or the\r\ncircus.\r\n\r\nIn fact, _jungle_ really means a _wild place_; that is, a place where\r\ntrees and bushes grow quite wild, so that men never cut down the trees\r\nor clear away the bushes. That is the natural home for all sorts of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nNow I am going to tell you about the wonderful way in which they live\r\nthere with their families, as we do in our homes; for the Papas and\r\nMammas among the animals are just as fond of their children as ours\r\nare. So you must _imagine_ that you are going into the jungle with\r\nme, so that I can show you everything. You see, it is just like a game\r\nof _pretending_, that we are going to play.\r\n\r\nThere is actually a place in the jungle where you can see all the\r\nanimals at once. In fact, that place is so wonderful that King George\r\nand Queen Mary of England went to see it; that was a few years ago,\r\nwhen they went to India, which is a far-away country. For in India\r\nthere is a huge jungle where many thousands of animals live.\r\n\r\nSo you must _pretend_ that I am taking you to the Royal party, and\r\nthat you are sitting with the King and Queen and all the fine men and\r\nlovely ladies; and we are watching the animals, while I tell you all\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nFirst, I must tell you that it is midnight, and all the animals are\r\ncoming to a stream of water to drink. This stream is a river about\r\ntwice as wide as a large street in your home town. We are sitting on\r\nthe bank, on one side of the stream; and the animals are coming to\r\ndrink on the bank on the other side.\r\n\r\n"But," you may say, "will not the animals see us across the stream,\r\nand get frightened and run away?"\r\n\r\nThat is quite true. But the King and Queen had thought of that. So\r\nthey ordered a lot of men to put a large net on their side of the\r\nstream, just in front of them, and then to cover the net with twigs\r\nand leaves so cleverly that the animals thought the leaves were a part\r\nof the jungle, and did not see the people on the other side of the\r\nnet.\r\n\r\nSo the King and Queen, and you and I, can peep quietly through the\r\nleaves and watch the animals. Almost all wild animals drink at\r\nmidnight; so we shall see them now.\r\n\r\nWhere will the animals come from? You see the stream before us; well,\r\non the other side of it is the jungle, where the animals live. Right\r\nin front of us we see a gap in the jungle close to the bank. That gap\r\nwas made by _elephants_ by beating down the bushes with their feet.\r\nThey made it long ago to come to the water, and now they use it every\r\nnight. In fact, it is known among the jungle folks as the _Elephant\r\nPath_; for no other animal would dare to use it before the elephants\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nThe elephants, being the biggest of all animals, are the _lords of the\r\njungle_; so they have the right to come first to drink. They are also the\r\nwisest of all animals. You have seen many kinds of animals--elephants,\r\nhorses, dogs, monkeys, and others--do funny tricks in a circus. Now, all\r\nthese animals except the elephant have to be _taught_ to do tricks; the\r\nelephant is the only animal that can think out a trick for itself.\r\n\r\nOf course in a circus there is always a teacher, or trainer, to show\r\neven the elephant how to do tricks; but in the jungle the elephant can\r\nfind out how to do things for itself.\r\n\r\nVery soon I shall tell you about the tricks which the elephant\r\nactually does in the jungle; and as you hear about them, you must\r\n_think_! Why? Because then you will know _why_ the elephant does these\r\nthings--and that will show you how clever _you_ can be!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elephants Drink First--but Down Stream_\r\n\r\nFirst let us watch the elephants as they come to the river through the\r\ngap in the jungle.\r\n\r\nSee! They come one at a time, _one behind another;_ for the gap is not\r\nbig enough for more than one at the same time. The elephant is so big\r\nthat it can get through the jungle only in this way.\r\n\r\nFirst come a number of _bull elephants_. They are the Papa elephants;\r\nyou can always tell them by the _huge tusks_ they have. The bulls\r\ncome first, in case there are any enemies waiting to hurt their\r\nchildren; for then the bulls can drive off the enemies.\r\n\r\nAs each bull elephant comes through the gap, you see him turn to our\r\nright, which is _down_ the stream--that is, the way the water flows.\r\nYou see the first one walk along the bank that way, and the second\r\ncomes after him, then the third, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut why do they walk along the bank? To make room, of course, for all\r\ntheir friends who are still coming from behind. In this way about a\r\ndozen bull elephants come ahead of all the others.\r\n\r\nAfter them you see the _cow elephants_, also in a line, one behind\r\nanother. They are the Mamma elephants; and nearly every one of them\r\nhas a baby elephant trotting in _front_ of her. You have often seen\r\nthe ordinary cow that gives you milk; when she goes to graze in the\r\nfield, her baby, or calf, trots by her side.\r\n\r\nBut the Mamma elephant is much wiser, and always tells her baby to\r\ntoddle in _front_ of her, in case any one comes suddenly to hurt or\r\nsteal the baby. For a tiger sometimes wants to pounce on the baby from\r\nthe side, grab it quickly, and carry it away. But he cannot do it if\r\nthe baby is right in front of its Mamma; for then she will drive him\r\noff with her tusks, even if they are not quite so big as the tusks\r\nthat the Papa elephants have.\r\n\r\nAs the Mammas reach the bank, each with her baby, you see them also\r\nwalk along the bank down stream in a long line.\r\n\r\nAfter all the Mammas and babies have come, you see another set of bull\r\nelephants coming out of the jungle. Why? Because some enemy might try\r\nto attack the Mammas and the babies from the _back_; so these bull\r\nelephants are there to guard them. You see, the Mammas and the babies\r\nare _always in the middle_, safe from all harm.\r\n\r\nWhen all the elephants have reached the stream, they stand in line and\r\nface the water. All these elephants belong to _one herd_; you can\r\ncount about a hundred. A herd of elephants is really a _republic_,\r\nlike the United States of America, and has a President, who is the\r\nwisest bull in the herd.\r\n\r\nIn another book I shall tell you how the elephants choose their\r\nPresident, and make laws, and keep order in the herd; how they choose\r\nsome strong bulls among them to act as _policemen_ in the herd, and\r\ncatch and punish any naughty elephant who becomes a _rogue_; and how,\r\nif two elephants start quarrelling and fighting like naughty boys, the\r\npolice elephants have to catch and punish both of them. Also, I shall\r\ntell you how the President has to lead the herd every day when they go\r\nin search of food, so that they will have plenty to eat.\r\n\r\nAnd in the jungle, as there are other elephant herds and sometimes two\r\nherds find the same feeding ground, and then start quarrelling and\r\nfighting as to who found it first, it is the duty of the President to\r\nkeep his own herd away from the two that are fighting, and not mix in\r\nthe fight in any way. All these wonderful things and many others you\r\nwill read in the other book, when you are a little older.\r\n\r\nBut let us see what the President has to do when the whole herd is\r\nstanding in line, facing the water. He is at the bottom of the line,\r\nfar down stream; so he looks up along the line to see that all are\r\nready. Then he gives the signal for them to begin drinking; he does\r\nthis by dipping his trunk into the water. Then the second one sees him\r\ndo it, and does the same; in that way each elephant higher up the line\r\nsees that the next one below him has started drinking, so he too does\r\nthe same. Soon they are all drinking, as you see in the picture at the\r\nbeginning of this book.\r\n\r\nBut why does the President have to give the signal to begin? Why is it\r\nthat any elephant, anywhere along the line, cannot start drinking,\r\njust as he or she pleases? Think!\r\n\r\nBecause if any one along the line started drinking too soon, he might\r\nmuddy the water for those that stood _below_ him along the line,\r\nbecause the water flows down that way. But if the lower ones drank a\r\nlittle before, it would not matter if they _did_ muddy the water, for\r\nthe higher ones would still have clear water to drink. That is why the\r\nlowest one drinks first, then the next, and so on up the line. Is not\r\nthat very wise, and very fair to all?\r\n\r\n\r\n_How the Elephant Drinks_\r\n\r\nBut you must not think that an elephant actually drinks _through_ his\r\ntrunk! He does not! The elephant\'s trunk is really his nose, though it\r\nis a very long nose. What he does is to dip the trunk into the stream\r\nand suck in the water about halfway up the trunk; then he curls up the\r\ntip of the trunk and gets it near his mouth; then he _blows_ through\r\nthe nose, and _squirts_ the water into his mouth. Of course he has to\r\ndo that many times, to get enough to drink. But he tries each time to\r\ndip only the tip of the trunk into the stream, so as not to muddy the\r\nwater willfully!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Why the Elephant Drinks with His Trunk_\r\n\r\nBut, you may say, why cannot he drink like other animals, by going\r\nright into the stream till he gets his _mouth_ into the water? Because\r\nhis mouth is so high up, and his neck is so stiff, that he would have\r\nto go quite two or three yards deep into the stream before he could\r\nget his mouth into the water, and then his heavy feet would stir up\r\nthe mud in the stream where he was standing, and so dirty the very\r\nwater he was drinking.\r\n\r\nNow you see what a wise animal the elephant is! The only way he could\r\nget clear water to drink was by having a long nose! And that is\r\nexactly what happened many, many years ago--his nose became long\r\nenough to reach the water from the bank. How that happened I shall\r\ntell you in another book, as you will not understand it till you are a\r\nyear or two older.\r\n\r\nAll the grown-up elephants drink in this way, and also some of the\r\nelephant children whose trunks have grown long enough to reach the\r\nstream. But what about a baby elephant? Why, its Mamma fills her own\r\ntrunk with water, puts the tip into the baby\'s mouth and squirts the\r\nwater into it.\r\n\r\nBut now after watching the elephants--who are on our right, down the\r\nstream--let us turn our eyes to the left, and look _up_ the stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe Law of the Jungle\r\n\r\n\r\nHush! Here come all the animals! The _buffaloes_, the _blue deer_, the\r\n_red deer_, the _wild pigs_, the _hyenas_, the _wolves_, the _red\r\ndogs_, and many others. Watch and see how each kind of animal comes;\r\nit is not always in the same way. The moon is now shining clear above\r\nthe trees, and we can see a long way up the stream.\r\n\r\nSee the _buffaloes!_ They come a little _above the elephants_. But\r\nthey do not come one behind another in a line, like the elephants.\r\nThey come three or four together. They also have beaten down the\r\nbushes there years ago, to make a drinking place; and it is wide\r\nenough for three or four of them to drink at the same time, side by\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Buffaloes Come to Drink--in Rows_\r\n\r\nBut why must they drink three or four at the same time? Because the\r\nbuffaloes are like a body of soldiers, one row behind another.\r\nSometimes twenty or thirty rows make up a herd. We see only the first\r\nrow drinking now, but soon we shall see the others behind.\r\n\r\nAnd why do the buffaloes come like a body of soldiers? Because they\r\nare afraid of their enemy--the tiger! Once upon a time the buffaloes\r\nlived scattered about, and many of them got eaten by the tiger, one at\r\na time. Then those that escaped from the tiger became wise; they\r\njoined together like a body of soldiers, so that they could beat off\r\nthe tiger. How they came to do that, I shall tell you at another time.\r\n\r\nBut now let us watch the first row drinking. They are all _bull\r\nbuffaloes_, the Papas of the herd; you can tell that by their _huge\r\nhorns_, a yard long on each side of the head. You see how the\r\nbuffaloes stand side by side, so that their horns almost touch one\r\nanother. That is the way the buffaloes have marched to the stream from\r\ntheir feeding place--horn to horn. Why? Because no prowling tiger can\r\nget past those horns.\r\n\r\nWatch the first row as it finishes drinking; the whole row wheels\r\naround to the side like soldiers. Then the buffaloes that have had\r\ntheir drink march to the back of the herd, and stand there in a row\r\nfacing the jungle.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the second row in the front has stepped to the water to\r\ndrink. These also are bull buffaloes. When they finish drinking, they\r\nalso wheel, march to the back of the herd, and there stand behind the\r\nfirst row. In this way four or five rows of bulls drink, one after the\r\nother, and go to the back of the herd.\r\n\r\nNext come about a dozen rows of _cow buffaloes_ and their calves, or\r\nchildren. You see again, like the elephants, the Mammas and children\r\namong the buffaloes are also _in the middle_, safe from all harm.\r\n\r\nThen at the end there are four or five rows of bull buffaloes again,\r\nto guard the Mammas and the children from enemies in the back.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buffalo Knights Guard the Timid Deer_\r\n\r\nBut wait a moment! Before the buffaloes go away, a most wonderful\r\nthing happens. You have read stories, how once upon a time there were\r\nbrave knights who used to come to the help of ladies who were in\r\ndanger. Well, you will be glad to know that these bull buffaloes are\r\njust like those brave knights. Do you see that timid little shadow\r\ncreeping in by the side of the buffaloes?\r\n\r\nShe is a _blue deer_, a very timid lady indeed; for she knows that a\r\ntiger is waiting in the high ground behind, to catch her. It is the\r\nlast chance of the tiger to get his supper; so he waits by the high\r\nground behind, and watches for some weak animal like the deer to come\r\nto drink.\r\n\r\nBut the blue deer knows that; so she hides in the bushes, and waits\r\nfor the buffaloes to come to drink. Then as the buffaloes come to the\r\nwater, row after row, horn to horn, she tries to creep in toward them;\r\nshe even tries to creep in _under_ the horns of the buffaloes, knowing\r\nthat there she will be quite safe from the tiger. It takes her a long\r\ntime to reach the buffaloes in that way, without being caught by the\r\ntiger.\r\n\r\nBut do you see the wonderful thing? The buffaloes wait a little for\r\nher! They take a little longer to drink, to give her a chance to reach\r\nthe water by their side. Like the brave knights, they feel proud of\r\nhelping a lady.\r\n\r\nNow see! The blue deer also has finished drinking. She goes away with\r\nthe buffaloes, under their horns. They all reach the jungle again. She\r\nlooks carefully: the tiger is watching her, but he dares not come too\r\nnear. She sees where he is--then suddenly she gives a leap--another\r\nleap--and another--quickly! The tiger leaps after her--but she leaped\r\nfirst! She is gone! She is safe!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Buffaloes and the Blue Deer]\r\n\r\nThe tiger is furious. He stands a moment before the buffaloes,\r\ngrowling with rage. But the bulls in front of the herd paw the ground,\r\nand rattle their horns with one another. They are going to charge!\r\n\r\nBut that tiger does not wait for the charge of the bull buffaloes. He\r\ndoes not want to be trampled into a mess under their hoofs, or cut up\r\ninto pieces with their horns. Instead, he sneaks away, growling. He\r\nsneaks back to the stream, to wait for some other weak animal.\r\n\r\nSo, you see, the jungle folks are in many ways just like us; for a\r\nbrave man always helps a lady or anybody who needs his help.\r\n\r\nBut now let us watch the stream higher up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wild Pigs--Careless_\r\n\r\nHere come the _wild pigs_. They are not exactly a herd; but still\r\nthere are many dozens of them, all one large family with all their\r\nrelations--cousins and uncles and aunts. Some of the wild pigs are\r\ncalled _boars_; they are the Papas among the wild pigs. You can always\r\ntell them by the two _sharp tusks_, or teeth, one on each side, which\r\ngrow _upward_ from their under jaw. Each tusk is as long as a knife,\r\nand so sharp that a tiger does not always care to fight with a boar.\r\n\r\nThe wild pigs drink in any fashion, and go off in any fashion--just as\r\nthey like. They trust to luck or to the sharp tusks of some of the\r\nboars to guard them from danger. But they have not learned enough yet\r\nto do things in proper order.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Red Dogs--Bold, Fearing Nobody_\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other animals have also come. The moon is now quite high in\r\nthe sky. A band of shadows in the moonlight seems to fall upon the\r\nwater. It is a pack of _red dogs_; they have come boldly, as they are\r\nafraid of nothing. For if a hungry tiger attacks them, the whole pack\r\nwill jump on the tiger and tear him down--that is, the tiger could\r\nkill dozens of the dogs in a few minutes, but then the rest of the\r\nwild red dogs would tear the tiger to pieces.\r\n\r\nSo the red dogs are not afraid as they come flocking to the stream.\r\nThey lap up the water with their lolling tongues. Then they look up at\r\nthe moon. Do you see what they are doing? Can you _hear_ them? They\r\nare _howling at the moon in a chorus_. Dogs always howl at the moon.\r\nMen do not quite know just why dogs do that. But perhaps they do it\r\nbecause they are glad and satisfied, and are trying to _sing!_ When\r\n_you_ sing, and there is a dog near by, you may hear him start\r\nhowling. He does that, I suppose, because he likes your singing, and\r\nwants to join in the chorus!\r\n\r\nSo the wild dogs of the jungle also howl when they are glad. Then,\r\nafter the red dogs have howled as long as a song, they scamper off\r\ninto the jungle again. That shows, I suppose, that their howling was\r\nreally a song!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Animals Come Alone_\r\n\r\nThe red dogs are the last of the animals that come in a bunch. Now you\r\nsee other animals coming one by one. A sneaking shadow there! It must\r\nbe a _hyena_. That is an animal that eats what remains from some other\r\nanimal\'s supper; so the hyena waits to see if a tiger or a leopard has\r\ncaught any supper, or else it will have to go hungry.\r\n\r\nBut hush! Here is a _red deer_ coming carefully to the water. This\r\nanimal is much bigger than the blue deer, and more able to take care\r\nof herself. But, still, she comes very quietly, looking to right and\r\nleft to make sure that the tiger is not just in that place. She\r\nreaches the water and starts drinking. But do you see how her ear is\r\nbent to the side? The red deer is listening most carefully, even while\r\nshe is drinking!\r\n\r\nBut look, look! The bush behind the deer parts very slowly, and a huge\r\nyellow form crouches there! It is the tiger!\r\n\r\nHe is not near enough to jump on the deer; so he takes one step\r\nforward--as softly as a cat!\r\n\r\nBut the deer has heard the footfall! For she can hear even a leaf when\r\nit falls to the ground. And in that one second, even while she was\r\ndrinking, the red deer has turned and leaped to the side. The tiger\r\nhas also leaped at the same time, and he aimed at the place where the\r\ndeer _was_. But the deer has just left that place, and the next second\r\nshe gives another leap, like a flash, and gets out of the tiger\'s\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nThe tiger stands where he leaped, and growls with rage. He knows it\r\nwould be no use chasing the deer, as _the deer can run much faster_.\r\nSo he stands there, and growls for quite a while. Then, as he did not\r\nget any supper that night, he can at least have a drink. So he drinks\r\nand goes away, still growling.\r\n\r\nNow all is quiet at last at the midnight pool, as all the animals have\r\ngone away.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Law of the Jungle--Clear Water for All_\r\n\r\nBut before _we_ leave the place, I want you to remember something. I\r\nshowed you first the elephants; they were on our right--that is,\r\n_down_ the stream, the way the water flows. And the elephants drank\r\nfirst among all the animals.\r\n\r\nThen all the other animals came to the stream, but more to our\r\nleft--that is, _up_ the stream. Why was that? Think!\r\n\r\nI shall tell you. By the time the elephants finish drinking by dipping\r\ntheir trunks into the stream many times, the water begins to get\r\nmuddy. In fact, after drinking, the elephants jump into the water to\r\nhave a bath and a swim, as I shall tell you in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nSo the water gets muddy near the elephants and all the way down stream\r\nfrom that place, as the water flows that way. And as the other animals\r\ndo not want muddy water to drink, they always go _up_ the stream,\r\nwhere the water is still clear.\r\n\r\nThat is _The Law of the Jungle_, though it is not written down in a\r\nbook, like the laws among men. The Law of the Jungle says that as the\r\nelephants are the lords of the jungle, they shall drink _first_: but\r\nthey must be careful to drink _down the stream_, so that all the other\r\nanimals may have a place higher up, where they can get _clear water to\r\ndrink_.\r\n\r\nAnd that law has never been broken, for many thousands of years, among\r\nall the different sorts of animals.\r\n\r\nBut with men the laws among the different sorts of people, called\r\nnations, are often broken, because some of them want all the best\r\nthings and the best places, and do not care if they muddy the water\r\nthat their neighbors have to drink.\r\n\r\nSo, my dear children, we can learn many things from the animals, even\r\nhow to be better men and women when we grow up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe Elephants\' Bath\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just told you that, after drinking, the elephants jump into the\r\nwater and have a bath and a swim. That is, all the grown-up elephants\r\ndo that, while the little ones stay on the bank and play about.\r\n\r\nBut, you may ask, why does not the tiger try to grab one of the little\r\nones then? Because even when the Mammas go into the water they keep\r\ntheir eyes on the babies, who play quite near by, so that the Mammas\r\ncan come to them any minute.\r\n\r\nAnd the Mammas can _smell_ a tiger a little before he gets there, so\r\nthat they have enough time to climb out of the water. Besides, the\r\nbabies themselves can smell the tiger when he is coming; then they\r\ncall out to their Mammas by making a queer rumbling sound in their\r\nthroats, and the Mammas come to them at once, before the tiger can get\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nSo all the grown-up elephants can go into the water, without any\r\nworry. And at first they have a regular shower bath.\r\n\r\nHow do they do that? Why, each elephant fills his trunk with water;\r\nthen he curls up the trunk in the air over his head and squirts the\r\nwater out, and it falls in a shower all over his body. You can see how\r\nhe does it in the picture. All the grown-up elephants do that, and\r\neven those that are half grown.\r\n\r\nAfter the shower bath, they swim about; but the Mamma elephants do not\r\ndo that. Why? Because they have to get busy and bathe their little\r\nchildren. They call to the children to stop playing, and come and have\r\na bath--just as our Mammas do.\r\n\r\nHow do they call? Why, I must tell you at once that all kinds of\r\nanimals have _a language of their own_. They do not speak exactly as\r\nwe do, but make different sounds through their mouth or nose, and each\r\nsound _means_ something.\r\n\r\nIf the Mamma elephant wants to say "Come here," she makes one kind of\r\nsound, and the baby elephant has learned to know exactly what that\r\nmeans. And if the Mamma elephant wants to say "Keep still," she makes\r\nanother kind of sound, and the baby knows also what that means.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Elephant Giving himself a Shower Bath]\r\n\r\nIn this way all animals can talk among themselves. Of course they\r\ncannot say many things, as we do, but quite enough to tell what they\r\nwant.\r\n\r\nSo each Mamma elephant calls to her child to come and stand on the\r\nbank. Now, many of our children often hate to be bathed; and the\r\nelephant children are just the same! In fact, the very small ones\r\nactually cry and shriek, just like our babies!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elephant Child Obeys Mamma--or Gets Spanked_\r\n\r\nBut when the Mamma elephant calls to the baby to stop playing and come\r\nand stand by the bank, the baby comes at once, even though it hates to\r\nbe bathed. The baby elephant obeys its Mamma almost the first time,\r\nwhatever she tells it to do.\r\n\r\nBut if the baby does not obey, does its Mamma spank it? Of course she\r\ndoes--like all Mammas! The elephant Mamma does the spanking with her\r\ntrunk.\r\n\r\nBut I must tell you at once that an elephant child never gets spanked\r\nmore than once in its life--and that is enough! And some are so good\r\nthat they _never_ get spanked!\r\n\r\nThe elephant child learns very quickly to obey its Mamma and Papa, and\r\nafterwards its trainer or teacher. The elephant child even obeys the\r\nvery minute it is told to do anything; in fact, sometimes in the\r\njungle there is a sudden danger, even if the elephant child does not\r\nsee the danger. But its Mamma or Papa sees it.\r\n\r\nThen the Mamma or Papa calls out to the child to stop, or come away,\r\nor do something, _at once_; and if the child does not do it at once,\r\nit may get killed. Among men folks, if a child runs out into the\r\nstreet, and an auto or a street car comes suddenly, then if the child\r\nwill not obey its Mamma at once and do exactly as she says, the child\r\nmay be run over and killed. In the jungle the elephant child also has\r\nsudden dangers like that, though in a different way.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter I shall tell you a wonderful story about a boy\r\nelephant who escaped a great danger because he obeyed his Papa at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes it happens that a boy elephant is really naughty--just\r\nlike a bad boy among men. As you know, a bad boy among men usually\r\ngrows up to be a bad man, and then he gets into a lot of trouble. In\r\nthe elephant herd it is just the same; a bad little elephant grows up\r\nto be a bad big elephant; it is then called a _rogue_. In another book\r\nI shall tell you how the President of the herd orders all the police\r\nelephants to stand in a ring around the rogue and give him a most\r\nawful spanking. And they do that, not with their trunks this time, but\r\nwith their _tusks_--which hurt most dreadfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How the Elephant Child is Bathed_\r\n\r\nBut now I shall tell you about the baby elephant when its Mamma calls\r\nit to come and be bathed. It comes to the edge of the bank, and stands\r\nfacing its Mamma. Then the Mamma fills her trunk with water, brings\r\nthe trunk quite near the baby, and squirts the water all over it.\r\n\r\nThe baby may howl and jump about and make faces, but it _never runs\r\naway_! Again and again the Mamma squirts the water, till all the mud\r\nand dust of the jungle is washed away from the baby\'s body. Then she\r\ntells the baby to play about on the bank again, while she attends to\r\nthe bigger children.\r\n\r\nWhat has she got to do to them? She must teach them to swim!\r\n\r\nOf course _all animals with four legs know how to swim naturally_;\r\ntheir bodies float in the water quite easily, and they have only to\r\nwork their legs to move along in the water. But with elephants it is a\r\nlittle different. Why? Just think!\r\n\r\nI shall tell you. Although they can float quite naturally, their noses\r\npoint downward right into the water. As I said before, the elephant\'s\r\ntrunk is its nose--that is, the elephant has to _breathe through the\r\ntrunk_. So of course, if in trying to swim a little elephant kept its\r\ntrunk down in the water, it would not be able to breathe at all, and\r\nwould die.\r\n\r\nThat is why the Mamma elephant has to teach her child how to swim\r\nproperly. And the way she does it is quite wonderful.\r\n\r\nI must first tell you that the trunk is not only like a nose to the\r\nelephant, but also is useful as a _hand_; the elephant can hold a lot\r\nof things with it, and can even pick up with its tip a tiny thing as\r\nsmall as a pin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How the Elephant Child Learns to Swim_\r\n\r\nSo the Mamma elephant stretches out her trunk before her, just like an\r\narm, and tells her child to lie across it. In that way she holds up\r\nthe child in the water, so that the little elephant has only to think\r\nof curling up the tip of its own little trunk out of the water to\r\nbreathe. Then she tells her child to kick out with its legs, so as to\r\nmove forward through the water.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes, in kicking out, the little elephant forgets to hold up\r\nthe tip of its trunk out of the water at the same time; then down goes\r\nits trunk into the water, and it cannot breathe!\r\n\r\nThen what happens? The Mamma elephant can do nothing, as she is\r\nalready using her own trunk to hold up her child. So, what is to be\r\ndone?\r\n\r\nReally, the elephants are so wise that they take no chances of that\r\nhappening. The Papa elephant takes care of that. When he sees that the\r\nMamma is teaching the little elephant how to swim, he always comes\r\nnear them. He may be swimming about, as if he were enjoying himself;\r\nbut he is really watching them all the time.\r\n\r\nAnd if the little elephant forgets to hold up its trunk out of the\r\nwater, the Papa comes quickly, and with one upward stroke of his own\r\ntrunk he lifts up the little elephant\'s trunk clear out of the water.\r\nIs not that very wise and thoughtful of the Papa elephant?\r\n\r\nIn that way the little elephant soon learns to do _both_ things--that\r\nis, to kick out with its legs so as to move along, and also to hold up\r\nits trunk to breathe. And then, of course, it can swim properly.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the elephants are so very wise that they never take the risk\r\nof tiring out a little elephant, if they have to swim a very long way.\r\nSometimes a whole herd of elephants has to swim across a very wide\r\nriver. Then the Mamma elephant tells her child to swim in front of\r\nher, while she encourages the child from behind with many fond words.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes after swimming halfway across the river--\r\n\r\n"Mamma, I am getting tired!" cries the little one.\r\n\r\n"Then come on my back, darling!" says the Mamma.\r\n\r\nShe dives, and comes up right under the little elephant; so now her\r\nchild sits on her back. In that way she swims along, and carries her\r\nchild across the wide river, as you see in the picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Elephant Mamma Carrying her Child across the River]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nElephants: The Tricks of the Jungle\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I shall tell you how a little elephant learns all the tricks of\r\nthe jungle from its Mamma and Papa. By the tricks of the jungle I mean\r\nall the things that an animal has to learn in order to get enough to\r\neat every day, what to do when food is scarce, how to be comfortable\r\nand happy, and also how to escape from every danger; in fact, these\r\nthings are very much like what men have to learn, only in a different\r\nway.\r\n\r\nBut the animal folks are better off in one way: what they have to\r\nlearn is not like a lesson in school, but just play. In fact they\r\nlearn everything by just playing it as a game! I shall tell you how.\r\n\r\nWhen a baby elephant is quite small, its Mamma has to feed it with\r\nmilk. Afterwards, when it has teeth, she teaches it to feed from the\r\njungle. All elephants eat tender shoots, herbs, and fresh young\r\nleaves; they seize a bough with the trunk, and pull it down in such a\r\nway that the end of the bough reaches right into the mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elephant Child Learns to Feed_\r\n\r\nFirst, the Mamma elephant eats like that from several boughs, while\r\nthe little elephant watches her do it. Then she looks at a low bough\r\nwithin easy reach, and says in the elephant language, "Eat that!"\r\n\r\nThe little one looks at the bough, grabs it anyhow with its trunk, and\r\npulls it down. But it cannot get the end of the bough _into its\r\nmouth_! Instead, the bough pokes it on the forehead, or eyes, or\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n"Hold it straight!" says Mamma, laughing.\r\n\r\nThe little one tries several times, but still it cannot get the bough\r\nto come right. Then its Mamma puts her own trunk over that of her\r\nchild, and turns it to right or left, till the bough comes exactly\r\ninto the little elephant\'s mouth.\r\n\r\n"You must learn to use your trunk just like a _hand_," she says. "So\r\nyou must bend your trunk, or turn it, or twist it, to get the thing\r\nyou are holding exactly where you want it."\r\n\r\nAnd that is the first great thing the little elephant has to\r\nlearn--_how to use its trunk as we use our hands_. After that\r\neverything else comes easy.\r\n\r\nNow I am going to tell you about the childhood of the most wonderful\r\nelephant in the world, who actually lives to-day in the courtyard of a\r\npalace in India. He is the biggest elephant that ever was; that is why\r\nhe lives in a grand palace, and does nothing except carry a King, or\r\nsome other great man, on his back on days of festival.\r\n\r\nIn fact he was the leader among all the elephants in a long procession\r\nat a grand festival called the Durbar, held in honor of the King of\r\nEngland. On that day a lovely cloth of silk woven with gold was put on\r\nthe elephant\'s back, and around his tusks were placed rings of solid\r\ngold studded with real diamonds, rubies, and pearls.\r\n\r\nAt another time he carried on his back the Crown Prince of Germany,\r\nwhen he visited India a few years ago; and at other times he has\r\ncarried Grand Dukes of Russia and Arch Dukes of Austria when _they_\r\nvisited India.\r\n\r\nSo you see, he is quite the grandest elephant in the world. He has a\r\nreal name, just like a man, and it is written down in books with the\r\nnames of all the grand officers of the palace. His name is Salar\r\nJung; so we shall call him Salar for short.\r\n\r\nHe was born in the jungle, and his Papa and Mamma were quite wild\r\nthen. It was only after he grew up that Salar came to live in a\r\npalace.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elephant Child "Swats" Tormenting Flies_\r\n\r\nBut now about Salar\'s early boyhood. After his Mamma had taught him to\r\nswim, to eat from the boughs of trees, and to drink for himself by\r\ndipping his trunk into the water, she had another useful thing to\r\nteach him. In the jungle there are swarms of tormenting flies; they\r\ncome buzzing around the elephants, and bother them, just as they\r\nbother us. Now, _we_ can whisk off the flies with our hands, but how\r\nabout an elephant?\r\n\r\nOf course, you will say, his trunk is his hand; and so he can use the\r\ntrunk to slap the flies or whisk them off. True, but the trunk will\r\nnot reach more than halfway down the side of the body; and the\r\nelephant is too stiff to bend his body as we do; and his tail is too\r\nshort to reach even a yard each way. Then how can he get rid of the\r\nflies where he cannot reach them? Just think!\r\n\r\nIf he only could make his trunk _longer_! But how could he do that?\r\nVery simply! Of course he cannot actually make the trunk longer, but\r\nhe breaks off a small bough of a tree and holds it at the end of his\r\ntrunk; then he uses the bough like a fan, and whisks off, or brushes\r\noff, the flies with it.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what Salar\'s Mamma taught him to do. After that he was\r\nvery comfortable.\r\n\r\nNot quite; he had just one more thing to learn from his Mamma, to make\r\nhim quite comfortable. The sun gets very hot, and when the elephants\r\nare feeding from tree to tree, or marching through the jungle, they\r\nfeel the hot sun on their backs dreadfully--although they have a thick\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nNow, how could they guard themselves from the hot sun? Just think!\r\n\r\nWhy, just as _we_ do, you will say, by using a kind of umbrella! Of\r\ncourse you mean that an elephant could break off a large bough, and\r\nhold it over his head and over his back! But his trunk would soon get\r\ntired of holding anything as big as that! Besides, he has to use his\r\ntrunk all the time to feed! If _you_ had only one hand, you could not\r\neat with it and at the same time hold an umbrella over your head with\r\nit! Then how _does_ the elephant manage it?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elephant Covers his Back from Hot Sun_\r\n\r\nI shall tell you. He breaks off many small boughs, one at a time, and\r\nlays them on his back with his trunk; he is careful to lay them in\r\nproper order, and to criss-cross them, so that the boughs will not\r\nfall off. In fact, he tries to arrange them very much like the\r\nthatched roof of a cottage. That is very clever of him, is it not?\r\n\r\nBut then he does something else, still more clever! When a cottager\r\nbuilds his thatched roof, he has to plaster the ceiling to prevent any\r\nrain or sunshine from creeping in through the little spaces between\r\nthe thatches. So also the thatch on the elephant\'s back has many gaps,\r\nthrough which the hot sun can still beat down on his skin. So what\r\ndoes he do to fill up the gaps?\r\n\r\nHe cannot do anything to _plaster_ his back; but I shall tell you what\r\nhe does do. He just draws into his trunk a lot of dust from the\r\nground; then he curls up the trunk over his back, and blows the dust\r\nover the gaps in the thatch on his back. Of course he has to do that\r\nmany times to fill up all the gaps; but at last, when he does not\r\n_feel_ the sun any more, he knows that his back is quite covered.\r\n\r\nIs not that a very wonderful thing for the elephants to think out, all\r\nby themselves? And that is what Salar\'s Mamma taught him to do.\r\n\r\nBut, a few years later, he came to the age when boys among men usually\r\nhave to go to school. Then Salar passed to the care of his Papa. In\r\nfeeding through the jungle, when all the elephants march and eat from\r\ntree to tree, Salar walked with his Papa, and began to learn lessons\r\nfrom him. And his Papa\'s way of teaching him was quite different from\r\nthat of his Mamma, and often very funny!\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Elephants Walk under Water_\r\n\r\nThe first thing he taught was at the stream at midnight. By this time\r\nSalar could swim quite well; so he was enjoying himself with the\r\ngrown-ups. But his Papa kept watching him with the corner of his eye.\r\nLittle by little he drew nearer and nearer to Salar, and waited till\r\nthe youngster came to a part where the water was not at all deep. Then\r\nsuddenly his Papa gave Salar a butt with his head. Down went Salar\r\nunder the water, snorting and spluttering and hollering.\r\n\r\n"Hold up your trunk, you simp!" cried his Papa.\r\n\r\nBut Salar was too frightened to remember to hold up his trunk; so his\r\nPapa caught Salar\'s trunk in his own and hoisted it clear out of the\r\nwater. Then what was Salar\'s joy and surprise to find that he could\r\nbreathe quite well, though his feet were actually touching the bottom\r\nof the stream. Of course he kicked out, and tried to get up to the top\r\nof the water again. But--\r\n\r\n"Stay there!" cried his Papa, giving him another butt, though still\r\nholding the youngster\'s trunk carefully out of the water.\r\n\r\nThen Salar lost all fear of the water; he was not a bit afraid of\r\nbeing ducked, so long as the tip of his trunk was out of the water. So\r\nhe learned to do a wonderful thing--he learned to remain completely\r\nunder the water, so that his feet were actually resting on the bottom\r\nof the stream, with only the tip of his trunk out of the water. No\r\nother animal can do that.\r\n\r\nAnd the most astonishing thing about it is that the elephants have\r\ntaught themselves to do that trick; so that _a whole herd of\r\nelephants can walk into a stream in time of danger, and disappear\r\nfrom sight_, the smaller ones standing in the shallow parts, and the\r\nfull-grown ones standing in the deeper parts.\r\n\r\nI have known of lots of hunters, who were chasing a herd of elephants\r\nand who saw the elephants run ahead toward a river, to find to their\r\nsurprise, on reaching the river, that the whole herd had disappeared\r\nas if by magic. They saw nothing, and did not dream that the little\r\nthings floating here and there, no bigger than your fist, could mean\r\nanything. But of course they were the tips of the trunks of the\r\nelephants hidden under the water.\r\n\r\nTo have thought out even that one trick for themselves proves that the\r\nelephants are the wisest of all animals, next after men folks. And\r\nthey have thought out many more tricks, as I shall tell you very soon.\r\n\r\nBut now I shall tell you the next trick that Salar\'s father taught\r\nhim. An elephant often has to break down trees in the jungle to clear\r\na way for himself; or sometimes he has to do that to make an open\r\nspace where he can lie down comfortably. So this is the way Salar\'s\r\nfather taught him to break down trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Elephants Break Down or Pull Out Trees_\r\n\r\nFirst he chose a small tree, not much thicker than your wrist; this he\r\npulled out easily with his trunk, just as you might use your hand to\r\npull out a small shrub. Then he chose a tree about six inches thick.\r\nHe tried it first carefully with his trunk; but the tree was too\r\nstrong to pull out in that way.\r\n\r\nSo the old elephant put his foot on the side of the tree, and pressed\r\nwith all his weight--as you see in the picture. The tree bent more and\r\nmore, and then suddenly broke off near the ground with a loud crack.\r\n\r\n"I can do that!" cried Salar, frisking around his father, impatient to\r\nshow what _he_ could do.\r\n\r\nSalar looked around and saw a tree of about the same size. He made a\r\ndash at the tree, put his right foot on it, and--\r\n\r\nHis father winked, but said nothing. For all elephants love a joke.\r\n\r\nNow the wily old elephant knew that this tree was a banana tree,\r\nalthough the fruit had not yet started growing on it. The tree looked\r\nquite hard and strong, but it was really very soft and easy to break,\r\nlike all banana trees. But Salar did not know that yet!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Elephant Breaking a Tree with his Foot]\r\n\r\nInstead, when he pressed on it with his foot and put his whole weight\r\non it, just as he had seen his father do to the other tree,--snap went\r\nthe tree like a twig, and Salar tumbled head over heels and went\r\nrolling over the ground.\r\n\r\n"Haw! Haw! Haw!" laughed the merry old elephant. "Did I not show you,\r\nsilly, how to try it first carefully, with your trunk, before putting\r\nyour foot on it?"\r\n\r\n"Of course you did!" Salar said, remembering.\r\n\r\n"That is what men folks mean when they say, \'You have put your foot\r\ninto it.\' You must remember _never to put your foot into anything\r\nbefore trying it first with your trunk_," the old elephant went on to\r\nsay. "Now watch me knock down a still bigger tree."\r\n\r\nThis tree was as thick as a man\'s body. After trying it first with his\r\ntrunk and then with his foot, the wise old elephant put his back on it\r\nand _heaved_. Little by little the tree bent on that side, but not\r\nvery much. The elephant stopped heaving, came around and looked at the\r\ntree. Then he began to heave from the _other_ side of the tree.\r\n\r\nYou have seen a man trying to loosen a nail from a board? He first\r\nhits the nail on one side, and then on the other side; and he goes on\r\nhitting the nail from side to side, till it is quite loose.\r\n\r\nWell, that cunning old elephant did just the same thing to that tree;\r\nhe first heaved the tree from one side, and then he heaved from the\r\nother side; and he went on heaving from side to side, till he loosened\r\nthe tree from the ground. Then he pushed the tree with his foot, and\r\nit came out of the ground and fell with a loud thud.\r\n\r\nAnd that is how Salar learned to heave with his body, though of course\r\nhe could not loosen so big a tree just yet.\r\n\r\nThere were many other tricks that Salar learned from his father, and I\r\nshall tell you one of the best of them in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nElephants: The Tricky Trap\r\n\r\n\r\nSalar and his father were going through the jungle, feeding from tree\r\nto tree, and from bush to bush. One day they saw a little clear space\r\nand in the middle of it a banana tree--just one tree. But beautiful\r\nbunches of ripe bananas were growing on it from a large stalk.\r\n\r\nSalar just loved bananas. In fact, all elephants do, as they cannot\r\nget them in the jungle more than once in many months; for bananas grow\r\nmostly in plantations kept by men. So Salar ran toward the tree\r\njoyously.\r\n\r\nBut the wise old elephant had seen at once that the space all around\r\nthe tree was rather level and clear of bushes. That was strange in the\r\njungle, he thought!\r\n\r\nNow, why did it look strange? Can _you_ tell? Why was it strange that\r\nthe space should be all flat and level, and clear of bushes? Just\r\nthink!\r\n\r\nBecause in the jungle that was not natural! In the jungle the space\r\nshould be all covered with grass and bushes, or at least with small\r\nshrubs of different sizes, just as you have seen in fields which are\r\nallowed to grow wild. So somebody must have _made_ the place level and\r\nflat, and cleared away the bushes! That is what the wise old elephant\r\nthought!\r\n\r\nThen, also, he had seen that there was just _one_ banana tree, with no\r\nother anywhere near it. That also seemed strange! Why? Because banana\r\ntrees always grow in groups of many dozens, whether they are in the\r\njungle or in a plantation.\r\n\r\n"Halt!" the old elephant cried, just in time. Salar was not more than\r\nfive or six yards from the tree when he heard his father\'s voice. I\r\nhave told you before that, when an elephant child is told to do\r\nanything by his Mamma or Papa, he obeys _at once_, or else he might\r\nfall into some awful danger--just as a child in a town might get run\r\nover by an auto or a street car.\r\n\r\nSo as soon as Salar heard his father\'s voice, he halted just where he\r\nwas. And that saved him, as you will see.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Elephant Taps Suspicious Ground with his Trunk_\r\n\r\nHis father came up to him, and looked around carefully. Then he\r\n_tapped on the ground with the end of his trunk_.\r\n\r\n"An elephant must always tap with his trunk when he is coming to\r\nsuspicious ground, before he puts his foot on it," he said to Salar.\r\n\r\n"What does suspicious ground mean?" Salar asked.\r\n\r\n"Ground where there might be danger, though you do not _see_ the\r\ndanger," his father answered.\r\n\r\nHe went on a couple of yards, tapping the ground before him all the\r\ntime. Then he suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\n"Gr-r-r-rump!" he cried, "it sounds strange and hollow!"\r\n\r\nMost carefully he put his foot forward and _felt_ the ground with it,\r\nas an elephant always does when he thinks there is danger. Now the\r\nground _bent down_ a little just where he pressed it with his foot!\r\n\r\n"I thought so!" he muttered.\r\n\r\nThen he felt most carefully all along the _front_ edge of the open\r\nspace, first tapping it with his trunk, then pressing on it with his\r\nfoot--of course with the toe end of the foot. And all along that front\r\nedge of the open space the ground bent down a little wherever he\r\npressed it with his foot.\r\n\r\nThen he came to the _right side_ of the open space where the banana\r\ntree grew, and tried the ground there also along the edge. And this\r\nground too bent down a little wherever he pressed it with his foot.\r\n\r\nHe came to the _back_ of the open space, and tried it in the same way.\r\nAnd there also the ground bent down a little along the edge, wherever\r\nhe pressed it with his foot.\r\n\r\nHe came around at last to the _left side_, and tried that also. And\r\nthere again the ground bent down in the same way.\r\n\r\n"All four sides are suspicious!" he cried. "My son, this is _a most\r\ntricky trap_!"\r\n\r\nAnd though he did not see them, a dozen men were hiding in the tops of\r\ntrees all around. They were the hunters kept by a great Prince, who\r\nhad ordered them to catch the big elephant and also the young one.\r\n\r\nThe hunters had first dug a huge pit. It was ten feet deep and\r\ntwenty-five feet wide on each side; so it was as big as a large room.\r\nThen they had covered the top of the pit by laying many long bamboos\r\nright across from side to side and very close to each other; so it was\r\njust like the roof of a large room. And on the top of the bamboos they\r\nhad spread a layer of earth--just like what you have seen in flower\r\nbeds in a garden; and on that they had planted grass, to make it look\r\nquite natural--only, they forgot that it might look natural for a\r\ngarden, but not for a wild jungle. Or perhaps they thought that an\r\nelephant would not know any better!\r\n\r\nAnd then they had gone to a plantation and fetched from there a banana\r\ntree, with a huge bunch of ripe bananas on it. They had set up the\r\ntree in the middle of that space; and as it would not keep straight,\r\nthey had first driven a long bamboo rod right through into the ground,\r\nand then tied the banana tree to the top of the rod.\r\n\r\nAfter doing all that, the hunters were hiding in the trees around.\r\nThey were watching to see the big elephant and the little elephant\r\ncome right up to the banana tree to eat the bananas, and get caught!\r\nFor if any elephant stepped upon that place, the top would give way\r\nunder his full weight, and he would fall right through into the pit.\r\n\r\nBut Salar\'s father grabbed him with his trunk, and pulled him away.\r\n\r\n"Come away!" he said. "This is a most hideous trap!"\r\n\r\nBut Salar, who loved bananas quite as much as you love ice cream,\r\nbegan to cry.\r\n\r\n"I want the bananas; I want them; I do, I do!" he kept saying over and\r\nover again.\r\n\r\nNow his Papa was very fond of Salar, but he did not know how to reach\r\nthe bananas and not fall into the pit. He and Salar walked home\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n"I must think it over a bit," he said, scratching his head with a\r\nbough.\r\n\r\nHe came there the next day with Salar, and looked all around the\r\nplace; but he could think of no safe way to get the bananas. The\r\nhunters also came there the next day, for by this time they were quite\r\nexcited to see what the wily old elephant would do. In fact, it was\r\nfrom the chief hunter of that Prince that I heard afterwards what the\r\nelephant did do.\r\n\r\nI must tell you here that these hunters had been watching the big\r\nelephant for many years, and trying to catch him by different kinds of\r\ntraps; and that is how we know all about him and Salar. For when an\r\nelephant is very big and has fine tusks, people sometimes try for ten\r\nyears to catch him, so that he may be used as the leading elephant of\r\na grand palace.\r\n\r\n_Almost all the elephants you see in the zoo or in a circus were once\r\nquite wild in the jungle_, and have been caught by some kind of trap.\r\nThey are then tamed, and finally trained to do tricks that men want\r\nthem to do. I shall tell you all about that in another book, when you\r\nare a little older.\r\n\r\nBut now about Salar and his father. On the third day the big elephant\r\ncame there again, with Salar; and again the hunters came and hid in\r\nthe trees around. This time the big elephant looked farther into the\r\njungle. Then he saw the long bamboos growing in a clump--the very\r\nclump from which the hunters had got the bamboos to make the trap. As\r\nthe elephant looked at the clump of bamboos, a thought came slowly\r\ninto his head.\r\n\r\nHe pulled out a long bamboo, and returned to the place where the trap\r\nwas. He stood just outside the trap, and thought again for some time.\r\nThen he held one end of the bamboo in his trunk, pointed the other end\r\nto the banana tree just where the stalk of the bunch began, and gave a\r\njab.\r\n\r\nBut he did not aim right, and the bamboo slipped off from the stalk.\r\nSo he tried again, and gave another jab at the stalk. In this way,\r\nafter trying many times, he managed at last to hit the stalk and break\r\nit. Down fell the bunch of bananas to the ground.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Salar was jumping around his father for joy. But his father\r\ntold him to keep still. He had not succeeded in getting those bananas\r\nyet! How could he get them out of the place of danger?\r\n\r\nIt puzzled him a long time. He poked at the bunch with the bamboo, but\r\nthat only broke off one or two of the bananas. Then he poked at the\r\nstalk of the bunch, but the end of the bamboo slipped off it, as there\r\nwas nothing on the bamboo to grip the stalk with.\r\n\r\nSo he drew back the bamboo and looked at that end of it, to see why it\r\ndid not grip the stalk. Of course the end of the bamboo was all\r\nsmooth, and could not grip anything at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elephant Tricks the Tricky Trappers_\r\n\r\nThen at last another thought seemed to come into the wise old\r\nelephant\'s head. He put that end of the bamboo into his mouth and\r\nbegan to _chew_ it; for an elephant has very strong teeth at the back\r\nof his mouth. As his mouth was very big, that clever elephant chewed\r\nas much of the end of the bamboo as his mouth would hold--and that was\r\nas long as your arm. So the end of the bamboo became like fibers, that\r\nis, like a bunch of hair, only very thick and rough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elephant Pulling Bananas out of a Tricky Trap]\r\n\r\nThen that cunning elephant sat down on the ground and pushed the\r\nbamboo along the ground straight before him toward the bananas. When\r\nthe hairy end of the bamboo reached the stalk of the bananas, he began\r\nto _twist_ the other end of the bamboo with the tips of his trunk; for\r\n_an elephant can use the tips of his trunk in the same way that you\r\nuse your fingers_.\r\n\r\nHe twisted and twisted many times, taking care to keep the hairy end\r\nof the bamboo pressed against the stalk of the bananas.\r\n\r\nIn this way the hairy end of the bamboo got knotted around the stalk.\r\nThat was just what the wise old elephant wanted.\r\n\r\nThen he pulled the bamboo slowly along the ground, as you see in the\r\npicture, taking care to give one or two more twists in case the knots\r\ncame undone. He pulled the bamboo lap by lap; that is, he pulled the\r\nbamboo for about a yard, then he let go and took hold of the bamboo\r\nfarther up; he pulled again for another yard, and so on. In this way\r\nhe at last pulled the bunch of bananas quite out of the trap.\r\n\r\nI need not tell you how he and Salar enjoyed that feast!\r\n\r\nAnd the hunters, who were hiding in the trees around, laughed and\r\nlaughed at the trick the wily old elephant had played on them! For, as\r\nyou see, he got the bananas and yet escaped from that trap! He beat\r\nthe men at their own game!\r\n\r\nBut now I must tell you about other animals,--first about buffaloes.\r\nThey are the brave knights who helped that timid little lady, the blue\r\ndeer. They are just as wonderful as the elephants, in their own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBuffaloes: The Knights of the Jungle\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three or four kinds of buffaloes that live in different\r\ncountries. The kind that lives in America you may have already heard\r\nabout. I am sorry to say that hunters have killed so many of them,\r\nthat there are very few buffaloes left in the United States now; and\r\nthese few are kept in parks.\r\n\r\nSo in this book I shall tell you about another kind of buffalo, that\r\nlives in the jungles of India. These are the buffaloes that have to\r\nlive in herds just because they have to guard themselves from the\r\ntiger. Yet they are much bigger than all other kinds of buffaloes in\r\nthe world. Many of them are more than ten feet long, and a span taller\r\nthan a tall man.\r\n\r\nThey have two huge horns which stand outward, one from each side of\r\nthe head. Each horn is at least a yard long; and there are some\r\nbuffaloes that have horns two yards long! (See the picture facing the\r\nnext page.)\r\n\r\nSo you can understand that this kind of buffalo is a strong and mighty\r\nanimal. But still, if just one buffalo tried to fight a tiger, the\r\ntiger could kill him every time. Why?\r\n\r\nBecause the tiger is much _quicker_ than the buffalo. The tiger could\r\njump to the side to escape the buffalo\'s horns. Then the tiger could\r\nturn quickly, and strike the buffalo on the neck from behind. And\r\nthough the buffalo\'s neck is very thick, the tiger himself is so\r\nstrong that he could break the buffalo\'s neck at one blow.\r\n\r\nSo, to guard against the tiger, the buffaloes have to live together\r\nlike a band of soldiers, so that the tiger never gets the chance of\r\ncatching just one buffalo alone.\r\n\r\nNow I shall tell you how these buffaloes live. They live in a part of\r\nthe country where there is plenty of water, and lots of trees and\r\ngrass. There is sure to be a stream or two in the jungles there, like\r\nthe one where we saw the buffaloes drinking at midnight.\r\n\r\nWhen the buffaloes are feeding in the jungle, and wandering here and\r\nthere to find good grass to eat, they always try to remain somewhere\r\nnear one of these streams.\r\n\r\nWhy do they do that? To drink, of course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Buffalo that lives in India]\r\n\r\nAnd as the country is hot, they may want to drink more than once in\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nStill, there is another reason why they like to be near water. Can you\r\ntell what it is?\r\n\r\n"To bathe in the water, when it is hot," you may say.\r\n\r\nThat is quite true; the buffaloes do enjoy a good bath. In fact, they\r\nlike to remain in the water for a long time, when the sun is very hot.\r\nThen they lie down in the shallow part, and remain neck deep in the\r\nwater. And every now and again they dip their heads in the water to\r\nkeep them cool.\r\n\r\nBut even when the sun is not at all hot, when the sky is cloudy, the\r\nbuffaloes like to go into a stream or a pond. Why?\r\n\r\n"Of course to wash themselves, and make themselves clean," you may\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buffaloes Cover Body with Mud against Flies_\r\n\r\nNo, my dear, you are wrong this time! Like some little boys, buffaloes\r\ndo not _want_ to make themselves clean! In fact, the buffaloes go into\r\nthe stream or the pond to _cover themselves with mud_! To _wallow_, as\r\nit is called. They do that by rolling in the mud where the water is\r\nshallow.\r\n\r\nAnd why do they want to cover themselves with mud? Because of the\r\ntormenting flies! Buffaloes of this kind do not have long hair on\r\ntheir necks, like the American buffaloes. In fact, they do not have\r\nmuch hair anywhere on their bodies--just like the ordinary cows which\r\nyou have seen near your home. So they are very much tormented by the\r\nflies.\r\n\r\nI have told you that an elephant can "swat" the flies with a bough\r\nwhich he holds in his trunk. But the buffalo has no trunk, and his\r\ntail can whisk off the flies for only a yard around. So, what can the\r\nbuffalo do to guard other parts of his body from the flies?\r\n\r\nThe only thing he can do is to go down into the mud, roll about, and\r\ncover himself with the mud. Then he does not feel the flies at all,\r\neven if they swarm all over him. And he need not trouble to work his\r\ntail at all, as he is protected all over by the mud.\r\n\r\nAnd when he comes out to feed again, if the sun happens to be very hot\r\nat that time, he does not mind it. Why? Because the mud on his body\r\nkeeps off the sun. So, you see, the mud is useful to the buffalo in\r\ntwo ways.\r\n\r\nBut now come with me into the jungle while I show you all that the\r\nbuffaloes do.\r\n\r\nYou must _imagine_ that I am taking you quietly through the jungle,\r\nwhere the buffalo herd is grazing right ahead of us. We are following\r\nthem from behind. You must be careful not to make a sound. If you\r\nshould tread on a rotten twig, the buffaloes would hear the sound as\r\nfar away as a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\nIn another book I shall tell you why all animals that keep their _ears\r\nclose to the ground_ while they are feeding can _hear a sound a long\r\nway off_.\r\n\r\nBut now let us hide behind this bush for a minute, and watch the herd.\r\nThey are eating the grass as they walk along. But do you see the\r\nwonderful way in which they are arranged? It is just like the shape of\r\nthe moon when it is new, that is, something like the letter C, and\r\nwhich we call a crescent.\r\n\r\nYou saw at the midnight pool that, when the buffaloes drink or march,\r\nthey are in rows close together, like soldiers. But when they are\r\neating grass, they could not be in rows; because then they would be\r\ntoo close together to pick out the best bits of grass. So, how could\r\nthey have enough to eat, and yet guard themselves from danger? To do\r\nthis they thought of arranging themselves in the form of a crescent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Buffaloes Guard against Tiger while Feeding_\r\n\r\nIt is a big crescent, as there are so many buffaloes that make it up.\r\nThe ends of the crescent bend in toward each other, just as if the two\r\ntips of the letter C were to close up a little, leaving only a small\r\nopening between the tips.\r\n\r\nThe buffaloes have their faces toward the _outside_ of the crescent.\r\nSo, as we are following the buffaloes from behind, we are looking at\r\nthem through the gap between the tips.\r\n\r\nThere are only bulls in the line making up the crescent; the cows and\r\nthe calves come behind them, so that they are _inside_ the crescent.\r\nSo you see, while the buffaloes are grazing and moving along, if they\r\nmeet any danger, the Papa buffaloes will face the danger. And as the\r\nMammas and the children are inside the crescent, they are quite safe.\r\n\r\nThis is the way the buffaloes feed and move along:\r\n\r\nThe Papas on the outside of the crescent tear off a mouthful of grass,\r\nwith one or two bites, and walk on a step or two while they are\r\nmunching the mouthful. Then, with another bite or two, they take a\r\nfresh mouthful and walk on a step or two while they are munching that.\r\nIn this way they leave enough grass for the Mammas and the young\r\nbuffaloes that are following them.\r\n\r\nBut now let us come out of this thicket, and go after the herd very\r\nquietly from behind. We shall see some wonderful things.\r\n\r\nYou notice at once that the Mammas and the children do not show any\r\nfear at all, as they graze along; they are quite sure that the Papas\r\nare taking good care of them all the time. The little ones even play\r\nabout here and there.\r\n\r\nSee that very young calf! He is playing about near the middle of the\r\nspace. He is only a few weeks old, and not much bigger than the calf\r\nof the ordinary cow. Watch and see how playful he is! He is just like\r\nany other calf. His Mamma is grazing along quietly, and he is now\r\nstanding still for a minute, looking at nothing. A calf and a baby can\r\ndo that quite well--just stare, and yet look at nothing.\r\n\r\nBut now this buffalo calf rushes to his Mamma very suddenly, and has\r\na mouthful of milk. He does not seem to want more than a mouthful at a\r\ntime. So he looks up suddenly, and stares. Then just as suddenly he\r\nplunges into a frantic race over the ground, all by himself.\r\n\r\nThe race also ends suddenly--after going only ten yards. Then he stops\r\nthere for a minute, stares, and trots back to his Mamma for another\r\nmouthful of milk. After that he looks up again for a minute, stares at\r\nnothing, and plunges into another mad gallop all by himself.\r\n\r\nSo you see that he spends his time doing two things--having a mouthful\r\nof milk, and then a mad gallop. And he does both very suddenly. He\r\nlikes to have his joys suddenly.\r\n\r\nA kitten or a puppy dog is different, and is nearly always doing\r\nsomething. It tumbles head over heels, or chases its own tail, or\r\nkeeps frisking about in some way or other most of the time. But the\r\nbuffalo calf is not like this; and when you see him standing quite\r\nstill, staring at nothing, you can never tell whether he is going to\r\nbe hungry for a mouthful of milk the next minute, or whether he is\r\ngoing to break into a frantic race.\r\n\r\nBut, you may ask, while he and all the other calves are playing about\r\nlike that, is there no danger?\r\n\r\nNo, there is no danger, for the Papas are taking good care of the\r\nMammas and the children, as I have told you before.\r\n\r\nBut, you may say, the Papas do not seem to be doing anything; they are\r\njust feeding and moving along. Then how are they taking care of the\r\nMammas and the children?\r\n\r\nYes, but look carefully! See how close the horn of one Papa is to the\r\nhorn of the next one! Why, there is not more than a couple of yards\r\nbetween the two! If there were any sudden danger, it would not take\r\nmore than two or three steps for them to close up, and stand horn to\r\nhorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Buffaloes Know Danger is Coming--Three Ways_\r\n\r\n"But how could they _know_ if any danger were coming?" you may still\r\nask.\r\n\r\nThey could know it in three ways: they could _smell_ the danger, or\r\n_hear_ it, or _see_ it. I shall tell you how they do all that.\r\n\r\nFirst, if the danger came from the direction in which the wind was\r\nblowing, they would sniff the air, and so _smell_ the danger. If the\r\ndanger were a tiger, the buffaloes could smell him half a mile off;\r\nthat is about as far as ten blocks in a city. And if the wind were not\r\nblowing that way, the buffaloes could still smell the tiger five\r\nblocks away. They could smell the tiger, or any other danger, even if\r\nit came from behind.\r\n\r\nThe second way of finding out the danger is to _hear_ it. As I said a\r\nlittle while ago, if you should put your foot on a rotten twig, the\r\nbuffaloes could hear the sound of it as far off as five blocks. And\r\neven if the danger came from behind, or from the side, or from\r\nanywhere, they could still hear it coming, if it made the least bit of\r\nsound that you and I could not hear.\r\n\r\nThe third way of finding out the danger is to _see_ it. The buffaloes\r\ndo that by keeping a lookout nearly all the time. I shall show you\r\nhow.\r\n\r\nJust watch for a minute the buffalo in the middle of the crescent; he\r\nis the leader of the herd. We can see him only from the back; but as\r\nhe is the biggest and tallest buffalo there, we can make him out quite\r\neasily. He is grazing quietly, and then moving along.\r\n\r\nBut see, what is he doing now? Why, he is looking up, straight ahead\r\nof him! No, he sees no danger there. So he gives a glance to his\r\nright, and then to his left. No, there is no danger there either. So\r\nhe puts down his head, and starts feeding again.\r\n\r\nThus, you see, every now and again he looks to see that no danger is\r\ncoming from anywhere in _front_ of the herd.\r\n\r\nBut what if any danger came from the _side_ of the herd,--right near\r\nthe end of the crescent,--or even from the _back_ of the herd?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buffalo Sentinels_\r\n\r\nLet us see what the two buffaloes at the two ends of the crescent are\r\ndoing. They are the watchers, or _sentinels_, as they are sometimes\r\ncalled. They keep a lookout nearly all the time.\r\n\r\nDo you see the one on our left? After every two or three mouthfuls he\r\nstops, and takes a look around; he even looks right to the back. Then\r\nhe takes four or five strides to catch up with the herd, and starts\r\ngrazing again. Then in a minute or two he takes another look around in\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\nAnd the sentinel on our right is doing just the same. Yes, the herd is\r\nquite safe; the two sentinels are sure to see if any danger comes\r\nfrom their side or from the back.\r\n\r\n"But will not the sentinels have less to eat, if they are watching\r\nhalf the time?" you may ask.\r\n\r\nYes, that is quite true. So all the Papa buffaloes take turns being\r\nsentinels. After a while the two sentinels from the ends move up\r\ntoward the middle, and the next ones then begin to keep watch. And\r\nthey keep changing places like that from day to day. That makes it\r\nquite fair for everybody.\r\n\r\nWhen they go to sleep also they are arranged in the form of a\r\ncrescent; but the two ends are closed up, so that the Papas make a\r\nring, while the Mammas and the children sleep inside the ring.\r\n\r\nWhen the Papas lie down, they are closer together than when they are\r\nfeeding; and they still keep their heads pointed to the outside of the\r\nring, so that they can get up in a minute, and be quite ready to drive\r\noff any tiger. Of course they have sentinels keeping watch all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBut now let us see other wonderful things that the buffaloes do, while\r\nthey are feeding.\r\n\r\nWe must be very careful how we follow the herd. The ground is now\r\nchanging, and getting quite rough; so the grass is getting scarce here\r\nand there. The buffaloes have not enough grass all the way; so they\r\nhave to walk on a few yards without eating, till they come to the next\r\npatch.\r\n\r\nSome of the buffaloes are even having a bite at fresh young shrubs in\r\npassing, as they will eat anything green, when they have not enough\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nBut see! The buffaloes are spreading out, as there are not even enough\r\nshrubs in one place. You can see gaps in the line of buffaloes now.\r\nAnd the gaps are getting bigger and bigger! Let us watch a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nNow the gaps are very wide, as some of the buffaloes are lagging\r\nbehind; and some are turning too much to the side in trying to reach a\r\nmouthful from a shrub or a bush here and there.\r\n\r\nWhy, what is happening now? Some of the buffaloes cannot even see one\r\nanother now, because of the bushes between them! What are the\r\nsentinels doing? And what is the leader doing? Suppose a tiger\r\nsuddenly comes--\r\n\r\nBut do you _hear_ that?\r\n\r\n"Moo! Moo!"\r\n\r\nThat is the leader. He has just found out that the herd is spread out\r\ntoo far; so he is calling. He is saying, "Where are you?"\r\n\r\n"Moo! Moo!" Do you hear that answer? It comes from the sentinel on the\r\nright, who is very far away now; but still he has heard the call. His\r\nanswer means, "Here I am!"\r\n\r\nAnd "Here I am!" comes the answer also from the sentinel on the left.\r\n\r\n"Then close up!" cries the leader.\r\n\r\nEach sentinel moves up toward the place from which he heard the\r\nleader\'s voice come. And on his way there he tells all the buffaloes\r\nhe meets to move up also. Besides, all the buffaloes hear the leader\'s\r\nvoice too; so they begin to close up at once.\r\n\r\nIs not that a wonderful way of bringing up all those that are lagging\r\nbehind?\r\n\r\nBut let us watch the herd again. They have closed up now, and there is\r\nno big gap in their line. The ground is level again.\r\n\r\nLet us move on from thicket to thicket, and come as near the buffaloes\r\nas we can.\r\n\r\nWhat is that? See! The sentinel on the right is looking hard at that\r\njungle grass far away to the side. This kind of jungle grass grows\r\nvery tall, taller than a man. But why is the sentinel staring at the\r\ntall grass? What does he see there?\r\n\r\nYes, there, far away, something is happening! The jungle grass is\r\nwaving gently, but just in one place! What is making the tall grass\r\nwave like that? Is it the wind? No, it cannot be the wind! Why not?\r\nBecause if it were the wind, _all_ the grass there would wave. Then\r\nwhat is making the tall grass wave in just one place?\r\n\r\nIt can be only one thing! Some _animal_ is hiding there in the tall\r\ngrass! And as the animal is coming nearer and nearer to the buffaloes,\r\nhe is making the grass wave!\r\n\r\nSee, the sentinel has guessed that also! What is he doing now? Can you\r\n_hear_ him? He gives a bellow, deep and long.\r\n\r\n"Danger! Look out!" That is what he means.\r\n\r\nThe whole herd hears him. They all close up as near together as they\r\ncan!\r\n\r\nQuick! Let us get up on that tree near by! _We_ are in danger as well\r\nas the buffaloes!\r\n\r\nOne branch higher--and another! Now we are quite safe! But see what\r\nthe buffaloes are doing!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buffaloes Make a Ring when Tiger Comes_\r\n\r\nThe two ends of the crescent have come close together, and all the\r\nPapa buffaloes have made a perfect ring around the Mammas and the\r\nchildren. The Papas are facing the outside of the ring; so they can\r\nmeet the danger from whatever side it comes.\r\n\r\nWhy do they do that? Look again at the grass! The tall grass is waving\r\nnearer and nearer. So, the animal that is in the grass is coming\r\nnearer and nearer.\r\n\r\nHe comes right to the end of the tall grass. There he makes a gap in\r\nthe grass, and walks out into the open. It is a tiger!\r\n\r\nHe was trying to sneak up to the buffaloes; but the sentinel found\r\nthat out. And now the bull buffaloes are ready for him. The tiger\r\ngrowls in rage. He prowls round and round the ring of bull buffaloes,\r\nas you see in the picture. But he dare not try to break through those\r\nhorns.\r\n\r\nHe roars with fury, shaking the ground; it is just like thunder. The\r\njungle around is taking fright at the roar. See! All the small animals\r\nrush out in fright--wild pigs, wild goats, and all sorts of small\r\ndeer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Tiger and the Ring of Buffaloes]\r\n\r\nIn their fright they run hither and thither very stupidly. That is\r\nexactly why the tiger roars--he wants to make the small animals behave\r\nso stupidly, in their fright, that some of them may make a mistake and\r\nrun straight into his jaws.\r\n\r\nSee! The small animals scatter to right and left, trying to reach a\r\nbush or thicket. But some are cut off from safety, as the tiger stands\r\nin their way. What can they do?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Small Animals Find Safety in Buffalo Ring_\r\n\r\nYes, there is the ring of buffaloes! So those small animals rush\r\nstraight toward the ring and creep inside--and the buffaloes raise\r\ntheir heads to make a way for them under the horns. Some of them, like\r\nthe wild goats, jump _over_ the buffaloes\' horns to get inside the\r\nring. Anyway, the small animals reach safety inside with the Mammas\r\nand the children of the buffaloes.\r\n\r\nThe tiger stands outside the ring, and still roars in fury. But now\r\nnobody is afraid. The bull buffaloes paw the ground impatiently with\r\ntheir hoofs, and rattle their horns. They are going to charge!\r\n\r\nBut that tiger does not wait for the charge. He does not want to be\r\ntrampled into a mess. So he slouches away, growling and snarling.\r\n\r\nSo, as you see, the bull buffaloes guard the Mammas and the children\r\nfrom danger, and they also guard all small and weak animals that come\r\nto them for safety.\r\n\r\nDid I not tell you that the buffaloes are the Knights of the Jungle?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tame Water Buffaloes Plowing in the Rice Fields]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTaming the Buffalo\r\n\r\n\r\nBuffaloes do not always remain wild and wander about in the jungle.\r\nMen need buffaloes. Farmers want to use them for plowing the ground,\r\nin the same way that farmers in America use horses for plowing.\r\n\r\nThis kind of buffalo also lives in Italy, and because they are so fond\r\nof water they are called _water buffaloes_ there. But in Italy they\r\nare not wild any more, as they have been tamed and used by men for a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\nI shall tell you how the men catch the buffaloes from the jungle in\r\nIndia, where they are still wild.\r\n\r\nThey catch the buffaloes in many ways. The easiest way is to find some\r\nstream or pond where the buffaloes are fond of going. Then the men\r\ntake strong nets made of ropes, and spread the nets under the water.\r\nSo when the buffaloes come to bathe or roll in the mud, some of them\r\nare caught in the nets.\r\n\r\nThen the men rush in from their hiding place and drag out the nets. Of\r\ncourse, those buffaloes which are not caught run away. But those that\r\nare caught struggle fiercely. After a time they get tired of\r\nstruggling, as the nets are too strong for them to break.\r\n\r\nWhen the buffaloes have become very weak from struggling, a lot of men\r\nrush up and tie a stout rope around the neck of each buffalo. The rope\r\nhas two ends, one on each side of the buffalo, and each end is quite\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nA dozen men haul at the rope, and the buffalo has to get up and march\r\nwith them. In this way the men bring the buffaloes one by one to the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nHow do the men tame the buffaloes? That is quite easy, if they already\r\nhave a few tame buffaloes which they may have caught and tamed some\r\ntime before. And as the people have been doing this for many, many\r\nyears, they always have some tame buffaloes. So this is the way the\r\nmen treat the wild buffaloes:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wild Buffaloes Tamed Quickly by Kindness_\r\n\r\nThey put the wild buffaloes and the tame ones together in a pen, or\r\ncorral. Inside the corral there is a pond. In the deep part of the\r\npond there is plenty of good water to drink; and in the shallow part\r\nof the pond there is plenty of mud in which the buffaloes may roll\r\nabout and wallow.\r\n\r\nThe men keep the buffaloes there together for many days, the wild ones\r\nand the tame ones. Every day the men throw into the corral plenty of\r\nfresh grass, which the buffaloes can eat all day.\r\n\r\nNow, what more could the wild buffaloes want? They could not be\r\ntreated any better! They have plenty to eat, plenty to drink, and\r\nplenty of mud in which to wallow. The tame buffaloes soon make friends\r\nwith them, and talk to them in their own language.\r\n\r\n"You will not be any better off in the jungle," the tame ones say to\r\nthe wild ones. "Here you do not have to walk about all day to get\r\nenough to eat, and then walk a good way to find water to drink, or a\r\nplace in which to wallow. And, also, we have no fear of tigers here.\r\nWhat more do you want?"\r\n\r\nSo in a few weeks the wild ones become quite tame. Still, even after\r\nthat, the old and the new ones are always kept together, and soon they\r\nbecome like one herd.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when the farmers use them for plowing, they always hitch\r\nto the plow one buffalo that has been tame for a long time, and one\r\nthat is newly-tamed. Then it becomes easy for the new one to learn the\r\nwork by just doing as his friend does.\r\n\r\nThe farmer uses the buffaloes for plowing for only a few hours, and he\r\ngives them plenty of time for wallowing and enjoying themselves. So,\r\neven if they have to do a little work, the new buffaloes soon see that\r\nthey are really much better off living in the village than running\r\nwild in the jungle.\r\n\r\nAfter the plowing season is over, the buffaloes have no work at all.\r\nThey can wallow all day, if they want to.\r\n\r\nWhen all the new buffaloes are quite tame, they are not kept in the\r\ncorral any more, as they would never think of running away now. They\r\nare allowed to lie about and sleep in a little plot of ground\r\nsomewhere in the village. By daytime they are taken out into the\r\nfields outside the village, and allowed to graze as they please; and\r\nas there is always a stream or a pond near, the buffaloes can go into\r\nthe water or the mud whenever they like.\r\n\r\nSo, as you understand, the buffaloes very soon become quite tame. Why?\r\nBecause they are treated kindly. Please remember that. _Most wild\r\nanimals can be tamed if treated kindly._\r\n\r\nNow I am coming to the nicest part about the buffaloes. It is the\r\nnicest part because it shows how the buffaloes can even be made to\r\nlove us.\r\n\r\nI have just told you that the buffaloes are taken out into the fields\r\nto graze. Well, then, somebody has to do that in the morning, and\r\nsomebody has to bring them home in the evening.\r\n\r\nCan you tell who does that? Why, there is a herdsman to do it, you may\r\nsay. Quite true. But the herdsman does not bother to do a simple thing\r\nlike that every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Little Boys Take Charge of Buffaloes_\r\n\r\nThen who does it? I shall tell you. The little boys of the village!\r\nThey are about five or six years of age. They are not old enough to go\r\nto school, and not old enough to do any work; so they can play all\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe most useful thing they can do is to take charge of the buffaloes.\r\nThe boys soon learn all the buffalo calls--"Come out to graze," "Come\r\nto wallow," or "Come home now." And the wonderful thing is that these\r\nhuge animals soon learn to obey these calls. When the boys call to\r\nthem, the buffaloes do just as they are ordered.\r\n\r\nThe buffaloes soon learn to love the little boys. You know how fond of\r\nus an animal can become--especially a dog or a horse. Still, I do not\r\nthink that any animal can show such love for us as the huge buffaloes\r\ndo for the little boys who act as their herdsmen.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because the little boys _share the same mud_ with the buffaloes!\r\nBoys and buffaloes mix very well with mud! The little boys tumble\r\nabout in the mud on the side of the bank where the buffaloes may be\r\nwallowing. Or the boys will splash about in the water where the\r\nbuffaloes are lying neck deep to keep cool. Or they will climb up on\r\nthe buffaloes\' backs for a while, then tumble off and play again.\r\n\r\nEven when the buffaloes are grazing in the field, the boys may be near\r\nthem, playing hide and seek, and running in and out between the\r\nbuffaloes\' legs, or under their horns. So the boys are with the\r\nbuffaloes all day long.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How the Big Buffaloes Love the Little Boys_\r\n\r\nIt is quite wonderful to see a little boy actually twisting a huge\r\nbuffalo\'s tail. As I have told you, a buffalo is often more than ten\r\nfeet long, and taller than a tall man; and it has horns that reach\r\nout more than a yard from each side of the head. This huge animal\r\ncould charge and smash up a big wagon as easily as if it were a match\r\nbox; and yet he will stand still and let his tail be twisted by any\r\nlittle tot in the village.\r\n\r\nSometimes you may see a sight like this: A huge buffalo is grazing\r\nhungrily, and a little boy comes up and stands right in front of him.\r\n\r\n"Put up your head!" says the boy. But the buffalo goes on feeding\r\nhungrily.\r\n\r\n"Put up your head, or I will spank you!" says the boy. But the buffalo\r\nstill goes on feeding hungrily.\r\n\r\nThen that tot raises his small hand and spanks the huge buffalo on the\r\njaw. The buffalo puts up his head, and rubs his nose lovingly against\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\nWell, why not? You have seen a baby pulling his Papa\'s hair. The Papa\r\njust loves the baby all the more for it. So it is with the buffalo and\r\nthe little tot. And it would not matter a bit whether the tot were a\r\nlittle boy or a little girl. The big buffalo is fond of both.\r\n\r\nAnd now I shall tell you a wonderful true story about a buffalo and a\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nThe Buffalo and the Boy\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a village there were many tame buffaloes, and among them thirty\r\nbull buffaloes. The little boys of the village took charge of them\r\nevery day. The smartest boy among them was called Gulab. He was six\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nGulab knew quite well each of the thirty bull buffaloes, and was a\r\nfriend of each. Sometimes he alone had charge of them, and took them\r\nout to graze and to wallow. That was because his father was the\r\nherdsman.\r\n\r\nThe buffaloes loved Gulab, and they did exactly as he told them to do.\r\nWhen he was going to take them to the fields, he would just stamp his\r\nlittle bare foot and call out to them "Stand in rows!" And the huge\r\nanimals would stand in rows, one line behind another.\r\n\r\nThen Gulab would come around to the side, and see if each line was\r\nstraight. If the line was not quite straight, and a buffalo happened\r\nto be standing too much this way or that, Gulab would walk up to the\r\nbuffalo and spank him on the jaw. Then the buffalo would move into\r\nline, exactly as Gulab wanted him to do. Or, if a buffalo happened to\r\nbe standing too far behind, Gulab would come around to the back and\r\ntwist the buffalo\'s tail, and the buffalo would move up into line.\r\n\r\nThen, when the whole herd was in the right order, Gulab would come to\r\nthe front of the herd, and walk up to the biggest bull.\r\n\r\n"Bend down your head, Baldo!" he would order.\r\n\r\nAnd Baldo, the biggest bull, in the middle of the front line, would\r\nbend down his head, and Gulab would climb up by one of the horns,\r\nscramble up Baldo\'s neck, and sit down on his back.\r\n\r\n"March!" Gulab would order--and the whole herd would march.\r\n\r\nNow, a few miles away there was a grand palace. In the palace was a\r\nlittle Prince, whose father was a Rajah--that is, a kind of king. The\r\nlittle Prince\'s birthday was coming, and his father ordered grand\r\nfeasts for many days.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah had six English friends, who were quite big men. The\r\nEnglishmen were very fond of tiger hunting, so the Rajah wanted to\r\norder a tiger hunt for them. But it is not easy to have a tiger hunt\r\njust when you want to have it. Why not? Because the tiger will _not_\r\ncome out and be hunted just when you want him to. He would rather stay\r\nin his den.\r\n\r\nSo for a few days no one heard of a tiger prowling about. Then\r\nsuddenly a strange piece of news came from that village where Gulab\r\nlived. It happened in this way:\r\n\r\nOne day Gulab took out the buffaloes to graze and to wallow. The\r\nbuffaloes lay down in the shallow water for a while, and Gulab\r\nsplashed about or tumbled in the mud near them. Then he got tired of\r\ndoing that, and came out on the bank and played about there for a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard a strange sound. It was one of the buffaloes, who\r\nhad stood up in the water and was giving a low, deep bellow. Two or\r\nthree other buffaloes stood up also, and gave a low, deep bellow. Then\r\nall at once the whole lot of them began to come out of the water.\r\n\r\nGulab stopped in his play to see what was wrong. But he could see\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, Baldo?" he asked. "What\'s wrong, Chando?"\r\n\r\nBut the two biggest bulls scrambled up the bank, and came rushing\r\ntoward the boy. All the other bulls came also, and some went past him\r\non the right side, and some went past him on the left side. Then\r\nsuddenly Gulab knew what it all meant!\r\n\r\nA snarl--a growl--a roar, he heard. A flash of yellow leaped out of\r\nthe jungle, and came toward him with a huge jump. It was a tiger!\r\n\r\nBut already the buffaloes were making a ring around Gulab. Then he\r\nknew what had happened. The tiger had seen him from the jungle beyond,\r\nand had been trying to creep up to him quietly from thicket to\r\nthicket. But the buffaloes had _smelled_ the tiger in time, and had\r\nrun out of the pond to save Gulab. And now they had made a ring around\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nGulab stood in the ring and looked with large round eyes, for he was\r\nmore frightened than he had ever been in his life. He was only a\r\nlittle boy, and had never seen a tiger face to face.\r\n\r\nThe tiger growled and snarled and roared. Then it came round and round\r\nthe ring, trying to find a gap between the horns to get at the boy.\r\nBut there was no gap between the horns.\r\n\r\nThen little by little the fear left Gulab\'s heart. Something inside\r\nhim told him to be brave. He walked up to Baldo.\r\n\r\n"Baldo, let me up!" Gulab said to him, standing behind the buffalo.\r\nAnd Baldo lowered his body behind, and bent his hind legs at the\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nGulab took hold of Baldo\'s tail in both hands, and put his foot on\r\nBaldo\'s hind knee, which was now bent quite low. In that way Gulab\r\nclimbed up to the buffalo\'s back, and sat on it, holding on to Baldo\'s\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nThen, being quite safe on the buffalo\'s back, Gulab glanced around and\r\ncalled to the buffaloes at the back of the ring, "Open out!" And the\r\nbuffaloes opened out at the back of the ring, and made a crescent.\r\nThen they moved still farther around, and the crescent became one long\r\nline, facing the tiger.\r\n\r\nGulab gave one glance to right and left, to see that all were ready.\r\nThen--\r\n\r\n"Charge, brothers, charge!" he cried to the buffaloes.\r\n\r\nThen his big brothers, the buffaloes, charged with thundering hoofs\r\nand fiery nostrils. The tiger gave a huge leap to the side to get\r\naway; but the buffaloes on that side opened out and headed off the\r\ntiger. On to the front again the tiger was forced to turn--and run for\r\nhis life before the furious herd.\r\n\r\nThe buffaloes chased and chased that tiger, across field and jungle,\r\nover hedges and ditches, through brambles and bushes and thickets,\r\ntill at last the tiger jumped across a ravine and ran away growling\r\nand howling and snarling, like a low thief who is chased out of a\r\nvillage at night.\r\n\r\nThe ravine was a deep hollow in the ground, like a huge ditch; and it\r\nran all the way across the ground; so the buffaloes could not get over\r\nit, as they cannot jump as far as a tiger. Then the buffaloes returned\r\nto the village, and Gulab gave the news about the tiger.\r\n\r\nSome of the village people ran to the palace, and said that the tiger\r\nmight be still hiding somewhere on the other side of the ravine. So\r\nthe six Englishmen went around to that side to hunt the tiger. They\r\nfound him and wounded him four or five times. But it takes a lot more\r\nthan that to kill a tiger. The tiger ran out, got past the hunters,\r\nand came back again across the ravine. Here he hid in a dense thicket,\r\nand would not come out and be hunted to please anybody.\r\n\r\nNow, when a tiger is hiding in a thicket and will not come out and be\r\nhunted, there is only one way to _make_ him come out.\r\n\r\nWhat is that way? Can you tell?\r\n\r\nWhy, of course, the bull buffaloes!\r\n\r\nSo the herdsman brought up the thirty bull buffaloes, and drew them up\r\nin a long line in front of the thicket. And on the other side of the\r\nthicket the six Englishmen got up into trees, and pointed their guns\r\nat the thicket.\r\n\r\nThen the herdsman ordered the buffaloes to charge, and they charged\r\nright through the thicket, trampling it down and cutting it up into\r\nlanes; so the tiger _had_ to run out on the other side. But on that\r\nside the six Englishmen were waiting for him; and they all fired at\r\nthe tiger at once, and all hit him. They used a kind of bullet that\r\nbroke up into a hundred pieces right inside the tiger.\r\n\r\nBut the tiger still kicked and kicked, and would not agree to be dead\r\nat once, as any other animal would. People say that a cat has nine\r\nlives; then a tiger must have ninety-nine lives. So this tiger jumped\r\nabout, torn up as he was, and glared at the Englishmen in the trees,\r\ntrying to get at them, while they were loading their guns for another\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nBut the buffaloes went on charging, and caught up with the tiger. They\r\nrushed upon him, and now the torn-up tiger could not get away. So the\r\nbuffaloes trampled upon him, and then the tiger agreed to lie still\r\nand be dead, really and truly.\r\n\r\nThe six Englishmen began to climb down from the trees, as they thought\r\nthe excitement was all over. But the herdsman called out to them at\r\nonce:\r\n\r\n"Please go up again--quick! Don\'t let my buffaloes see you!"\r\n\r\nFor I must tell you now that buffaloes do not like strangers. They may\r\nbe very fond of their own friends in the village; but if they should\r\nsee a stranger, they would charge him just as quickly as they would\r\ncharge a tiger. And the Englishmen would look quite strange to the\r\nbuffaloes.\r\n\r\nSo the Englishmen remembered that, and stayed up in the trees till the\r\nbuffaloes were taken away.\r\n\r\nThe buffaloes were taken to the pond; and as the herdsman would not\r\nbother to stay with them there, he left the buffaloes in the pond to\r\ndo as they pleased till evening.\r\n\r\nThe six Englishmen had their lunch there, when they got down from the\r\ntrees. They gave their guns to their servants, to carry away to the\r\npalace. Afterwards the Englishmen walked about, smoking their cigars,\r\nas they did not want to return to the palace so soon.\r\n\r\nBut four or five hours passed, and still they had not come back to the\r\npalace. It was nearly evening, and still they had not come.\r\n\r\nAnd in the village Gulab said to his Papa, who was the herdsman,\r\n"Papa, I shall bring the buffaloes home now."\r\n\r\nHe went to the pond. But the buffaloes were not there! He shouted,\r\nwhistled, and gave all the buffalo calls he knew. But no answer!\r\n\r\nHe looked about, and searched everywhere, but he could not see the\r\nbuffaloes. What had become of them?\r\n\r\nThen he happened to look far to the side, toward a lot of tall trees.\r\nSomething was happening under the trees! He could see a lot of things\r\nmoving there, but he was too far away to see what they were.\r\n\r\nHe ran toward the trees. Yes, they were the buffaloes! But why were\r\nthey there? And why were they behaving like that?\r\n\r\nFor he saw that they were pawing the ground angrily, and tossing their\r\nheads and rattling their horns. And what was very strange, the\r\nbuffaloes were not looking at anything on the ground in front of\r\nthem. They were looking _up_, at the trees!\r\n\r\nThen Gulab glanced up into the trees, and saw at once why the\r\nbuffaloes were behaving like that. But he did not waste a minute. He\r\nran to the buffaloes, shouting:\r\n\r\n"Down, Baldo! Down, Chando!"\r\n\r\nBut the two biggest bulls and all the others glared at the trees and\r\nsnorted in fury.\r\n\r\n"Down!" Gulab shrieked. "Down, or I shall spank you!"\r\n\r\nHe rushed to Baldo, and spanked him on the jaw. He rushed to Chando,\r\nand spanked him on the jaw. He rushed from buffalo to buffalo, and\r\nspanked each one on the jaw.\r\n\r\nThen the huge animals that had charged the raging tiger, and that were\r\nnow fierce themselves, obeyed the little boy. They blinked, then one\r\nby one lowered their heads. Gulab climbed up by Baldo\'s horns, and\r\nseated himself on his back.\r\n\r\n"Now turn around, all!" he ordered. And the buffaloes slowly turned\r\naway from the trees.\r\n\r\nGulab looked back over his shoulder, and said to the six Englishmen\r\nwho were up in the trees: "You may come down now. My buffaloes won\'t\r\nhurt you a bit, because if they try to I will spank them!"\r\n\r\nThen the little boy took away the buffaloes, and the six big\r\nEnglishmen came down from the trees quite safely.\r\n\r\nAnd now, do you understand what had happened? I shall tell you. The\r\nEnglishmen had forgotten what the herdsman had told them--about\r\nkeeping away from the buffaloes. The Englishmen had walked about, and\r\nhad finally come near the pond where the buffaloes were.\r\n\r\nThen the buffaloes had come out and charged them. The Englishmen had\r\nrun and run, and had just managed to reach the trees. But the\r\nbuffaloes had come there after them! So the big Englishmen had to stay\r\nup in the trees, and wait for some little village boy to come and take\r\naway the furious buffaloes.\r\n\r\nI have told you this story, my dear (and it is a true story) just to\r\nshow you what kind of an animal the buffalo is--at least, this sort of\r\nbuffalo. Even when he is furious, he will do anything for the little\r\nboy whom he loves.\r\n\r\nBut as it is a true story, I must tell you one more thing that\r\nhappened--and I am sure you will be delighted to hear about it. The\r\nsix Englishmen went to the palace, and laughed and laughed, and told\r\nall about it to the little Prince whose birthday it was.\r\n\r\nThen the Rajah, who was the little Prince\'s father, said that Baldo\r\nand Chando should not be made to plow any more, or do another bit of\r\nwork in their lives. Why? Because Baldo and Chando had first helped to\r\nsave Gulab from the tiger at the pond, and then afterwards they had\r\nhelped to hunt the tiger.\r\n\r\nSo after that, Baldo and Chando were allowed to walk about the village\r\nas they pleased, and nibble at anybody\'s hay or grass, and splash in\r\nanybody\'s pond, and wallow in anybody\'s ditch, rut, or mire.\r\n\r\nAnd what was little Gulab\'s reward for saving the six Englishmen?\r\nWell, the little Prince, whose birthday it was, came and took Gulab by\r\nthe hand, and brought him to the grand palace, and gave him lots and\r\nlots to eat--cakes and ice cream and candy--so that Gulab went home\r\nthat night very full and very happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nDeer and Antelope\r\n\r\n\r\nThe buffalo has many relatives among other animals which also have\r\n_horns_. In fact, all animals that have horns are some relation to\r\neach other--first cousin, second cousin, third cousin, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo\'s nearest relatives are the ordinary cows and bulls that\r\nyou see in the fields.\r\n\r\n"But the sheep and the goat also have horns," you may say. "Are they\r\nalso cousins?"\r\n\r\nYes, they are. In the same way the _deer_ and the _antelope_ are also\r\ncousins to each other. I am now going to tell you about them.\r\n\r\nThe deer and the antelope are not exactly the same kind of animal, as\r\nyou might perhaps think. As I said, they are only cousins. If you look\r\nat them carefully in the pictures on pages 103 and 109 you will see\r\nwhich is the antelope and which is the deer--just as you can tell a\r\nsheep from a goat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Antelope\r\nPhotograph of a group in the American Museum of Natural History, New York]\r\n\r\nFirst see the picture on page 103. These are _antelope_. Look at the\r\nhorns carefully. They are something like a cow\'s horns; only, a\r\ncow\'s horns are sometimes bent and twisted in different ways. But the\r\nantelope\'s horns point upward, and are much longer than a cow\'s horns.\r\nThey sometimes look almost like a pair of long and thick spikes,\r\npointed at the top.\r\n\r\nNow look at the picture on page 109. These are _deer_. Look at the\r\nhorns carefully--only, they are not called horns when the animal is a\r\ndeer, but _antlers_, which is a special name. So take a good look at\r\nthe deer\'s antlers. There are two of them, and they grow from the top\r\nof his head, like the antelope\'s horns.\r\n\r\nBut look again. The antlers _start_ from the head as _two_ spikes, but\r\nhigher up each antler branches out into _many_ parts. In fact, near\r\nthe top each antler looks something like the branches of a small tree\r\nwithout leaves.\r\n\r\nSo now you can always tell which is an antelope and which is a deer:\r\nthe antelope\'s horns have no branches, but the deer\'s antlers have\r\nmany branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Horns and Antlers Different in Three Ways_\r\n\r\nThe antelope\'s horns and the deer\'s antlers are also different in\r\nother ways, which you cannot see in the pictures. So I shall tell you\r\nabout them:\r\n\r\n1. The antelope\'s horns are _hollow_ inside, and made of the same kind\r\nof thing as the _hoofs_ or _nails_ of an animal, only they are thicker\r\nand harder. But a deer\'s antlers are _solid_, and made of _bone_.\r\n\r\n2. Both the Papas and the Mammas among antelopes have horns. But among\r\nmost kinds of deer, only the Papas have the antlers; the Mammas have\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n3. Among antelopes, when once the Papas and the Mammas have grown\r\ntheir horns, they keep them always. But among deer, the Papas throw\r\naway their antlers every year, and grow _new ones_. That seems very\r\nwonderful! I shall tell you more about it soon.\r\n\r\nBut now I shall tell you, little by little, all the wonderful things\r\nthe deer and the antelope can do. I shall begin with the deer, as\r\nthere are many kinds of deer in America.\r\n\r\nOf course, in America there are not such wild jungles as in countries\r\nwhich are hot all the year round. Still, there are many places in the\r\nWest and a few other parts of America where there is some kind of\r\njungle and plenty of forest. A forest is a kind of jungle, only it has\r\nmore trees, and fewer thickets; but wild animals can live there just\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elk and Other American Deer_\r\n\r\nThe biggest kind of deer in America is the _moose_; in fact, it is the\r\nbiggest kind of deer in the world. The second biggest is the _elk_; he\r\nis nearly as big as the moose. Some people think that the moose and\r\nthe elk are exactly the same kind of deer, but that is not quite\r\ncorrect. In this book I must not make it too hard for you to\r\nunderstand, by telling you how they are different. So I shall tell you\r\nall about the elk, as his picture is on page 109.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time elks lived in all parts of America, but now they have\r\nbeen killed off by hunters in most parts, and are found wild only in\r\nthe Far West.\r\n\r\nThe elk is a fine fellow. At the shoulder he is as tall as a man, and\r\nis as heavy as six men. He lives in places where there is plenty of\r\nforest--that is, plenty of trees. Why trees? Because he needs them in\r\nwinter--for then the bark is his food!\r\n\r\nIn summer he has plenty to eat--leaves, twigs, and grass. But when the\r\nwinter comes, and the leaves fall, and the ground is covered with\r\nsnow, the poor elk would starve and die, if he did not have at least\r\nthe bark of trees to eat. And very little bark he gets for many days\r\nat a time.\r\n\r\nHere I must tell you that some kinds of deer are among the most _hardy\r\nanimals_; that means that at times they can live on very little. There\r\nis a kind of deer, called the _reindeer_, that lives in the frozen\r\nNorth, where there is snow and ice almost all the year round; and the\r\nreindeer has nothing more to eat for many days than a little bit of\r\nmoss or seaweed.\r\n\r\nBut there is another animal, not a deer, that is still more hardy: he\r\ncan go a whole week without eating or drinking--and do work all the\r\ntime! That seems very wonderful. But I shall tell you about that\r\nanimal in another chapter.\r\n\r\nNow about the elk. His antlers are fine! You can see in the picture\r\nhow huge they are. And yet, would you believe it, he grew them in only\r\nfive months! I told you a little while ago that a deer throws off his\r\nantlers every year, and grows new ones. I shall now tell you how the\r\nelk does that.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elk\r\nPhotograph of a group in the American Museum of Natural History, New York]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the winter, the elk\'s antlers break off bit by bit.\r\nIn a few weeks they have all fallen off, leaving the elk\'s head\r\nbare, with just a ridge or rough stump on it. Then, early in the\r\nspring the new antlers start growing from the top of the stump. They\r\ngrow very fast, and in five months are as huge as ever.\r\n\r\nBut while the new antlers are growing, they are not hard. As yet they\r\nare soft and tender, and all that time they have an outside covering\r\nlike hairy leather, to guard them from harm. But as soon as the elk\r\nfeels that his antlers are quite grown, and are strong and hard, he\r\nstrips off the outside covering by rubbing the antlers against trees.\r\n\r\nOf course, while his antlers are still growing, and are soft and\r\ntender, the elk cannot use them to fight another animal; so during\r\nthat time he hides in the bushes. But as soon as his new antlers have\r\nbecome hard and strong, he is very brave again, and is ready to fight!\r\n\r\nDoes the elk fight much? He does! He fights most awfully when he has\r\nhis new antlers. What he fights about, and with whom he fights, I\r\nshall tell you in another book.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other kinds of deer in America, but the funniest of\r\nthem is called the _mule deer_, which lives along the Rocky Mountains.\r\nHe is called the mule deer because he has very long ears, like a\r\nmule\'s ears. And perhaps you have seen a mule bucking--that is,\r\njumping about while holding his legs quite stiff. Well, the mule deer\r\ncan buck just like that.\r\n\r\nAnd while he is running at a gallop, he will often jump off the ground\r\nwith stiff legs, and then hop on and on many times like that, with\r\nstiff legs, finishing up with another gallop.\r\n\r\nThat makes him look very funny, and because he jumps like that people\r\nin Canada sometimes call him the _jumping deer_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Kinds of Deer_\r\n\r\nI must now tell you about some other kinds of deer that live in\r\njungles and forests in other countries.\r\n\r\nThe _fallow deer_ lives in Europe. When he is wild, he lives in a\r\nforest; but when he is tame, he lives in a park. He is a small deer,\r\nabout the size of a donkey. His coat is very soft and glossy and\r\nbeautiful. In winter his coat looks dark brown, and his legs and the\r\nunder part of his body are light brown. But in summer his coat becomes\r\na lovely light red in color, with white spots jotted all over it. Then\r\nhe is very handsome.\r\n\r\nIn India also there is a handsome deer, which the people call the\r\n_lion deer_. He looks quite gentle and mild. Then why do the people\r\ncall him the lion deer? Because he has a lovely coat, golden yellow in\r\ncolor. You could see him far across the open field, if he only stood\r\nthere. But he is so timid that he does not often come out in the open.\r\n\r\nAnd why has he a yellow coat? Because he lives in a place where there\r\nis plenty of yellow grass; and if he stood right in the middle of the\r\ngrass, and did not move, nobody could see him. Even if a tiger were\r\nlooking for him, and the deer stood quite still in the grass, the\r\ntiger could not find him.\r\n\r\nIn another chapter I shall tell you how other animals have on their\r\nbodies the _color of the place where they live, or where they want to\r\nhide_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Barking Deer--One of the Wonders of Nature_\r\n\r\nNow I am coming to one of the nicest kinds of deer in the world, and I\r\nam sure you will just love him! He lives in India, and is called the\r\n_barking deer_; only, he is not exactly a deer, but an antelope. You\r\nremember what I have told you before, about an antelope having a\r\ndifferent kind of horns? Still we must call him the barking deer, as\r\npeople have already given him that name.\r\n\r\nHe is very small, about the size of a goat. If there is any danger\r\nfrom an enemy, the barking deer is small enough to hide in any little\r\nbush or behind a fallen tree or log; or else he can run away very\r\nquietly through the under bushes. And he runs so quickly that his\r\nenemy soon loses sight of him.\r\n\r\nHe is called the barking deer, because he can bark or yap almost like\r\na dog. But, you may ask, why does he want to bark at all, if he is\r\nafraid of some enemy? Will not the enemy hear him, and then catch him?\r\n\r\nYes, that is quite true. And yet the fact that he does bark is one of\r\nthe most wonderful things in the jungle. It is so wonderful that in\r\nanother book I shall tell you more about it. But now I shall tell you\r\njust this:\r\n\r\nThere are some animals which are so deadly that they could kill off\r\nmany, many other animals. So, as the only way to save the other\r\nanimals from being all killed, _God has made some special animals to\r\nfight those deadly animals_.\r\n\r\nThere is the _cobra_, which is a snake, and which has such a deadly\r\npoison that it could kill almost all other animals in the jungle by\r\njust biting them. So, to save the other animals from being killed by\r\nthe cobra, God made the _mongoose_. He is a plucky little creature,\r\nabout the size of a cat. And he will fight and kill every cobra he\r\nsees! But really he is such a wonderful animal that I must keep him\r\nfor another book, when you are old enough to know him better and to\r\nlove him.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the deadly animal is too strong to be killed himself.\r\nThere is the tiger. He can kill and eat many kinds of animals. But who\r\ncan kill _him_? No animal! At least, the elephant and the buffalo\r\ncould kill the tiger if the tiger should let them _catch_ him and\r\ntrample on him. But the tiger does not let any animal catch him. Then\r\nhow can the other animals be saved from the tiger?\r\n\r\nGod made two special animals to save the others from the tiger. The\r\nfirst is the buffalo, of which I have already told you, and which is\r\nthe Knight of the Jungle. The second animal is the barking deer. How\r\nthe barking deer saves the other animals from the tiger, I shall now\r\ntell you:\r\n\r\nWhen the tiger is prowling about, all other kinds of deer and antelope\r\njust run away, and are glad enough if they escape being eaten. But\r\nnot the plucky little barking deer! He too runs away, but as soon as\r\nhe gets a little ahead of the tiger, he stops under a bush and lets\r\nout that bark or yap--then runs on at once to another bush.\r\n\r\nThe tiger is furious, and jumps on the bush where he heard the\r\nbark--but the deer is not there now! The deer barks from that second\r\nbush--and runs to another one. In this way the barking deer leads the\r\ntiger on and on through the jungle from bush to bush.\r\n\r\nAnd why does he bark like that? To tell the other animals in good time\r\nthat the tiger is coming, and then to tell them exactly _where_ the\r\ntiger is.\r\n\r\n"Look out, here\'s a tiger!" That is the meaning of his first bark.\r\n\r\n"Here he is! He is coming after me--this way!" That is what he means\r\nby the next bark.\r\n\r\n"He is chasing me this way! You run the other way!" And that is what\r\nthe barking deer keeps on saying, as he runs from bush to bush, so\r\nthat all the other animals know exactly where the tiger is at each\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nIn this way the barking deer runs through the jungle, _warning all the\r\nother animals_, and so spoiling the tiger\'s dinner all the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDeer and Antelope: Their Special Gifts\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have learned by this time that _every animal has some special\r\ngift_, that is, he can do one thing better than most other animals.\r\nThe deer and the antelope have their special gifts.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is their gift of _hearing_. I have already told you that\r\nthe wild buffaloes can hear a long way; but the deer and the antelope\r\ncan hear still farther.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that a tiger is trying to creep up to a deer through\r\nthe jungle, as quietly as he can. The tiger is still a long way off,\r\nand quite hidden by the bushes, so the deer cannot _see_ him at all.\r\nBut the deer can _hear_ him coming, even if the tiger takes each step\r\nvery lightly. Why? Because the deer\'s ears are so sharp that he can\r\nhear even a leaf rustling under the tiger\'s foot, a long way off. So\r\nthe deer can run away in good time.\r\n\r\nTo make him hear still better, the deer can turn or bend his ears to\r\nthe side from which the sound is coming. You have seen an ordinary\r\ncow prick up her ears when she heard somebody coming; and many other\r\nanimals--even a dog--can do the same.\r\n\r\nBut the deer can do that best. The shape of his ear is like that of a\r\nfunnel, so as to _pour_ the sound into his ear, as it were. Then even\r\nif there is only a single drop of sound, it gets right into his ear.\r\n\r\nAnd by turning or bending his ear, the deer knows which way the sound\r\nis coming. You also can tell which way a sound is coming, if it is\r\nloud enough; but the deer can do that even when the sound is very\r\nfaint. That is very useful to him, as he then knows exactly _which\r\nway_ a sneaking tiger is coming, and can run the _other way_.\r\n\r\nI must now tell you that the tiger himself, tries to come so quietly\r\nthat the deer may not hear him at all; and to help him to do so, his\r\nfeet are padded with muscles, just like cushions. So it is a kind of\r\ntrial between the tiger and the deer as to which is the more clever.\r\nIf the tiger can come so quietly that the deer cannot hear him, then\r\nthe tiger is more clever than the deer. But if the deer can hear the\r\ntiger, even if the tiger comes most quietly, then the deer is more\r\nclever than the tiger.\r\n\r\nThat kind of trial between two different animals as to which is the\r\nmore clever, goes on in the jungle all the time: and _the more clever\r\none wins every time_. If the tiger is more clever than the deer, the\r\ntiger eats the deer; but if the deer is more clever than the tiger,\r\nthe deer escapes being eaten. And that is true of all other animals.\r\nIn fact, one of the great wonders of the jungle is that the animal\r\nwhich is _the fittest wins the oftenest_; and so he goes on living,\r\nwhatever may happen to the others.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _To the Teacher._--Please give the class other examples\r\nof the "Survival of the Fittest" among other creatures--birds,\r\ninsects, fish, etc.]\r\n\r\nNow I come to the second special gift of the deer and the antelope. If\r\nby any chance a deer cannot hear a sneaking tiger, he can still\r\n_smell_ the tiger.\r\n\r\nMost animals can smell their enemy a long way off, even if they do not\r\nhear him or see him; but _the deer and the antelope can smell the\r\nfarthest_. Even if a sneaking tiger is so cunning that he stops in a\r\nthicket and stands quite still for a minute, so that he does not make\r\nany sound at all,--and so the deer cannot hear him,--even then the\r\ndeer can smell him when he is still a long way off.\r\n\r\nI must tell you now that the tiger himself can smell the deer. But he\r\ncannot do that very far off,--so the deer always smells him _first_!\r\n\r\nAlso, the tiger can hear the deer, if the deer happens to be moving.\r\nBut the tiger cannot hear quite so far as the deer can. So the deer\r\nalways hears him _first_!\r\n\r\nBut in one thing the tiger is better off than the deer: _the tiger can\r\nsee farther than the deer_. In the night most animals can see a\r\nlittle, but the tiger can see a little better and farther than the\r\nothers. And in the daytime, if a deer were feeding in a very big level\r\nfield, and a tiger came to the field from the other side, the tiger\r\nwould see the deer before the deer could see him. Then the tiger would\r\ncome round to the nearest thicket, and try to creep up to the deer\r\nfrom thicket to thicket.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Each Animal has the Gift he Needs Most_\r\n\r\nSo, you understand, the deer can _hear_ farther and _smell_ farther;\r\nbut the tiger can _see_ farther.\r\n\r\nAnd that is so because it is a wonderful rule in the jungle that _each\r\nanimal has the gift that he needs most_.\r\n\r\nBut can you think why the tiger _needs_ to see farther, and why the\r\ndeer _needs_ to hear farther and smell farther? I shall tell you.\r\n\r\nThe tiger is the catcher, and the deer is the one that is caught. So\r\nthe tiger tries to get to the deer, and the deer tries to run _from_\r\nthe tiger.\r\n\r\nBut to get to the deer, it would be no use to the tiger if he could\r\nonly smell or hear the deer, for then he would only know that the deer\r\nwas _somewhere_ near, but could not find the exact spot; and to catch\r\nthe deer the tiger must know exactly where the deer is. So the best\r\nway for him to know that is to _see_ the deer.\r\n\r\nBut for the deer himself, all that he needs to know is that a tiger is\r\nsomewhere near. So it is quite enough for him to know from which side\r\nthe tiger is coming, by just smelling him or hearing him. Then the\r\ndeer can run the other way at once. He does not want to see the tiger\r\nat all!\r\n\r\nSo, you understand, the tiger\'s best gift is to be able to see the\r\ndeer; and the deer\'s best gift is to be able to smell and hear the\r\ntiger.\r\n\r\nBut then, you may ask, if the deer can always run away long before the\r\ntiger can get at him, does a tiger never catch a deer?\r\n\r\nYes, a tiger does catch a deer once in a while, if the deer happens\r\nto make a mistake! And the deer can make only one mistake like that in\r\nhis life, because after the first he gets eaten!\r\n\r\nSo, you may be sure, the deer tries very hard never to make even that\r\none mistake.\r\n\r\nAnd what is that one mistake? It is to run straight into the jaws of\r\nthe tiger! It may just happen that when the deer hears the tiger\r\ncoming, he does not listen quite carefully, and so he does not know\r\nwhich way the sound is coming. Then, in running away, the deer may\r\nhappen to go just the wrong way--and fall into the tiger\'s jaws.\r\n\r\nOr else it may happen that the deer is so frightened that he loses his\r\nhead, as it were, and goes just any way--and by bad luck chooses the\r\nwrong way, and falls into the tiger\'s jaws.\r\n\r\nBut I must tell you that, although the tiger tries very hard to eat\r\nthe deer, _the deer tries still harder not to be eaten!_ Why? Because\r\nif the tiger does not catch the deer for to-day\'s dinner, he can still\r\ncatch some other animal for tomorrow\'s breakfast, even if he goes\r\nhungry to-night. But if the deer once gets eaten, there is no\r\nto-morrow for, him at all! The tiger is only trying _to get a meal_,\r\nbut the deer is trying _to save his life_. That is why the deer\r\nnearly always gets away from the tiger--because he is trying harder\r\nthan the tiger.\r\n\r\nSo the tiger does not get deer to eat much oftener than most children\r\nget roast turkey. The tiger lives mostly on pork, for the wild pigs of\r\nthe jungle are such careless animals, as I have told you before. Now\r\nand again the tiger gets mutton also, for the wild sheep are silly\r\ncreatures, like other kinds of sheep. In the same way the tiger\r\nsometimes catches a wild goat.\r\n\r\nThe tiger would really get deer to eat a little oftener than he\r\nactually does if it were not that the deer has two other gifts by\r\nwhich he can escape from the tiger at the last minute. Those two gifts\r\nare his _quickness in getting started_, and his _speed in running_.\r\nSo, even if the deer makes a mistake and runs toward the tiger, he can\r\nstill escape from the tiger if he finds out his mistake in time.\r\n\r\nFor, as you saw at the midnight pool, the deer may be drinking\r\nquietly, when he hears or smells a tiger. Then the deer can leap at\r\nonce and get away, before the tiger can leap. Or it may happen that\r\nthe deer is trying to escape from a tiger and has run to within\r\ntwenty yards of the tiger, when he finds out his mistake. Then the\r\ndeer can turn _at once_ and leap sideways to get out of the tiger\'s\r\nreach. The deer is so quick that he can turn aside without stopping,\r\nand keep on running.\r\n\r\nThen after that, once he has turned away from the tiger, the tiger can\r\nnever catch him. For the deer can run ever so much faster than the\r\ntiger.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the deer or the antelope is the fastest animal in the world,\r\nexcept one other. About that other animal I shall tell you some\r\nwonderful things in the next book. But among all animals I have told\r\nyou about in this book the deer is the fastest.\r\n\r\n"But how do people know that the deer can run faster than other\r\nanimals?" you may ask. "Has anyone had a race between different\r\nanimals?"\r\n\r\nYes, some people did that in England a few years ago. They took the\r\nfastest racehorse in the country, and ran a race between him and the\r\nfastest greyhound; and the greyhound beat the horse in the race. Then\r\nthey took that greyhound, and ran a race between him and an English\r\ndeer; and the deer beat the greyhound in the race. So, you see, the\r\ndeer was faster than the greyhound, and the greyhound was faster than\r\nthe horse! So the deer was the fastest of the three.\r\n\r\nAnd the deer that lives in the jungle is even faster than the English\r\ndeer. Why? Because the English deer lives in peaceful glades and\r\nforests, and has no other animal trying to catch and eat him; so he\r\ndoes not try to be as fast as he could be. But the deer that lives in\r\nthe jungle has to try very hard all the time to be as fast as he can\r\nbe, or else he would be eaten by the tiger! And, as you must know, _we\r\ncan do the best in anything when we try the hardest_.\r\n\r\nSo, all kinds of wild deer in the jungle have been trying their\r\nhardest to run as fast as they can. And as their fathers and\r\ngrandfathers have been trying to do that, the wild deer to-day have\r\nbecome the fastest runners among all the animals I have told you\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThe Camel\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _camel_ has very little to do with the kind of jungle I have been\r\ntelling you about; but he has much to do with the _desert_. A desert\r\nis another kind of wild place. As I told you before, jungle means any\r\nwild place; but usually, of course, there are lots of trees and bushes\r\nand thickets in it. But we call the wild place a desert when trees and\r\nbushes and thickets will not grow there, because the ground is all\r\ncovered with _sand_. In the desert there is nothing but sand all over\r\nthe ground, and not a single tree or a tiny blade of grass anywhere,\r\nas far as you can see.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the place where camels can do some very wonderful things,\r\nas I shall now tell you. The camels do not actually live in the desert\r\nall the time, but in countries quite near there.\r\n\r\nFirst I must tell you that there is only one country to-day, called\r\nCentral Asia, where camels are still found wild. In all other places\r\nthey are not wild any more, for in those countries people have lived\r\nfor many thousand years; so the people caught all the camels once upon\r\na time, and tamed them.\r\n\r\nSince that time the camels have been used by people in those countries\r\nfor their work, just as we use horses here; and rich people in those\r\ncountries count their wealth by the number of camels they have. Just\r\nas we say here that a rich man has a million dollars, or two millions,\r\nor three millions, so in those countries a man is thought to be rich\r\nwho has one thousand camels, or two thousand, or three thousand.\r\n\r\nIt was just the same in those countries in olden times. You have read\r\nin your Bible history that Job was once a rich man, as he owned\r\nthousands of camels.\r\n\r\nYou will see from the pictures facing page 128 that there are two\r\nkinds of camels; one kind has a huge hump on the middle of his back;\r\nand the other kind has two humps, with a gap between. The _One-Hump\r\ncamel_ is called an _Arabian camel_, or a _dromedary_. Once upon a\r\ntime he lived in the country called Arabia; that is the country from\r\nwhere you get your lovely old stories of Ali Baba and Aladdin. But now\r\nthe One-Hump camel also lives in other countries near there. These\r\nare all very hot countries, with many miles of desert here and there.\r\n\r\nThe _Two-Humps camel_ is called a _Bactrian camel_, as he lives in a\r\ncountry which was once called Bactria. That country also has many\r\ndeserts, like Arabia; but as it is far to the north of Arabia, it is\r\nvery cold in winter, and the snow then lies very thick on the ground.\r\nSo try and remember this:\r\n\r\nThe One-Hump camel lives in a country where there are many miles of\r\ndesert, and where it is very hot almost the whole year. So the\r\nOne-Hump camel has to guard himself only from the _hot burning sand_.\r\n\r\nThe Two-Humps camel lives in a country where there are also many miles\r\nof desert, but where it is very hot in the summer and very cold in the\r\nwinter. So the Two-Humps camel has to guard himself from the _hot\r\nburning sand in the summer_, and from the _cold and snow in the\r\nwinter_.\r\n\r\nThe Two-Humps camel has in winter a coat of long, shaggy hair on his\r\nback to guard him from the cold; and in summer the shaggy hair comes\r\noff his back, just as if he were to cast off his thick coat. But the\r\nOne-Hump camel has only short hair, as the country is too hot all the\r\ntime to need a thick coat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bactrian Camel--with Two Humps]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arabian Camel--with One Hump]\r\n\r\nNow I must tell you how camels are used. First, they carry goods for\r\ntrade. In those countries there are hardly any railroads, so the\r\nmerchants carry their packages on camels. Of course they could not put\r\na package right on a camel\'s hump, as it would fall off; so they\r\nalways join two packages together with a band or belt, and sling the\r\nband across the camel\'s back, so that there is a package on each side\r\nof the camel.\r\n\r\nWhen a One-Hump camel is used, the band or belt has two parts, like a\r\nloop; and the loop rests over the hump, so that the band cannot slip\r\nbackward or forward. When a Two-Humps camel is used, the band of\r\ncourse rests in the gap between the two humps, so that it cannot slip\r\nat all; and then the two packages can be made very big. That is why\r\npeople like the Two-Humps camel better for carrying goods, and like\r\nthe One-Hump camel better for riding. But in some places the One-Hump\r\ncamel is used both for riding and for carrying goods.\r\n\r\nIn this way merchants carry their goods for many hundred miles across\r\ndesert and country. Then sometimes they come to the sea and send the\r\ngoods in ships to different countries. That is how you get many of the\r\nfigs, dates, and grapes you eat; so the next time you eat them, think\r\nof the patient camel that brought them for you across the desert. That\r\nis why the camel is called the _Ship of the Desert_.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful carpets and rugs and shawls which you see in rich homes\r\nhave also been brought by the patient camels; and some of the lovely\r\nvases and ornaments that rich people have were also carried by camels.\r\nAnd not only across the desert, but even over ordinary land camels\r\ncarry these goods. The camel is such a large animal that he can carry\r\npackages as heavy as four men.\r\n\r\nOf course when he carries such a heavy load, he cannot go any faster\r\nthan a man\'s walk; but the camel can keep on walking all day, with\r\njust a short rest once in a while. Those used for riding cannot run as\r\nfast as a horse, but they can keep on running at a steady trot much\r\nlonger than a horse, and then after a short rest can start running\r\nagain. So by the end of the day a camel can run twice as far as a\r\nhorse, and sometimes still farther.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Camel\'s Wonderful Gifts_\r\n\r\nNow I am going to tell you of the most wonderful things a camel can\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nFirst, I must tell you that no other animal could cross a desert at\r\nall. To begin with, if such an animal as a horse tried to walk on the\r\nsand, his hoofs would sink into the sand up to the ankles, and it\r\nwould be hard work for him to go even a mile. But a camel\'s foot is\r\ndifferent. It has a _soft pad of muscles_ under it, just like a\r\ncushion; and when the camel walks or runs on the sand, the pad spreads\r\nout under his foot, and that gives him a firm hold on the sand in\r\nwalking or running. So remember that the camel has padded feet.\r\n\r\nI must tell you here that the feet of all animals are formed in the\r\nway they can best use, in the country in which they live. Those\r\nanimals that have to walk on _hard ground_ have _hoofs_, and those\r\nthat have to walk on _soft ground_ have _padded feet_. The elephant is\r\nthe only animal that has to walk on hard ground, at least very often,\r\nand yet has padded feet. Can you tell why? Because of his huge weight!\r\nHe is so heavy that if the bones under his feet were not covered with\r\na thick pad, he would jar the bones every time he put his foot down,\r\neven if the ground were not very hard.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the camel\'s padded foot is very useful to him even\r\nwhen he is not in the desert, but on hard ground; for he too is\r\nrather heavy, though of course not so heavy as an elephant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sand Storm in the Desert]\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons why no other animal could cross a desert as\r\neasily as a camel. In the desert there are sometimes fierce storms;\r\nand as it is all sand there, the strong wind blows the sand about in\r\nevery direction. As there is no place there where one could get away\r\nfrom the sand, any other animal would soon have a lot of sand blown\r\ninto his nostrils; then he would be choked. But a camel\'s nostrils are\r\nmade differently, so that whenever he likes he can _close his\r\nnostrils_, as easily as you can close your mouths, and that keeps away\r\nthe sand. The camel is clever enough to lie down on the ground when a\r\nstorm is blowing, and to lay his neck and chin along the ground; then\r\nhis nose is quite close to the ground, where the storm is not quite so\r\nfierce as in the air.\r\n\r\nOf course, when he wants to breathe, he opens his nostrils a tiny bit\r\nto take in a little air; then he closes the nostrils again, and holds\r\nhis breath for a little while. He has to keep on doing that as long as\r\nthe storm lasts.\r\n\r\nBut what does his master do, who has been riding on his back? He\r\ncannot close his nostrils; so the only thing he can do is to get off\r\nthe camel and huddle against the camel\'s body on the side far from the\r\nwind; then he brings his face quite close to the ground and holds his\r\nnose with his hand. When he wants to breathe, he opens his fingers\r\njust enough to make a slit and let the _air_ in, but not enough to let\r\nthe _sand_ in.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason why no other animal could cross a desert: his\r\neyes would be blinded by the fierce glare of the sun. But a camel has\r\nvery _thick hair on his eyebrows_, which hang over the eyes, and keep\r\noff the fierce rays of the sun. His eyelashes also are very thick, and\r\nhelp to keep off the sun in the same way.\r\n\r\nBut there is a still more wonderful reason why no other animal, except\r\na camel, could cross a desert. In a desert water is very scarce, and a\r\ntraveler crossing a desert on a camel may not find any water for a\r\nwhole week. Of course, he carries on his saddle half a dozen bottles\r\nof water to drink; but after drinking some of the water each day, he\r\nhas not much to spare for the poor camel. Then what is the poor camel\r\nto do?\r\n\r\nOf course, you may say that his master should carry more water for the\r\ncamel to drink. But the load of goods which the camel has to carry is\r\nalready so heavy that there is not much room for any more water. Then\r\nwhat _can_ the poor camel do?\r\n\r\nWhy, he _carries his own drinking water_, not in the load on his back,\r\nbut _inside his stomach_! Is not that a wonderful thing? His stomach\r\nis made differently from that of any other animal. The stomach of any\r\nother animal, Or even a man\'s stomach, is so made that the water drunk\r\nat any time is all used up in the next few hours; that is why any\r\nother animal, or even a man, has to have another drink after those few\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nBut a camel\'s stomach is so made that it has one big place for food\r\nand drink like the stomach of any other animal, but it also has many\r\nsmaller places arranged all around the stomach; these smaller places\r\nare just like bottles, and are called _cells_.\r\n\r\nSo when a camel takes a good long drink, the big place in the middle\r\nof the stomach takes in the water first; then as he drinks more and\r\nmore, the bottles or cells all around begin to get filled also. And\r\nthe wonderful thing is that as soon as each cell is full, its mouth\r\ncloses up by itself! In that way, if the camel drinks long enough, all\r\nthe cells get full, one by one, and then have their mouths closed up.\r\n\r\nWhen a camel is about to start on a long journey through the desert,\r\nhe takes a very long drink, till he _feels_ that he cannot drink any\r\nmore; then he _knows_ that all the bottles or cells inside are quite\r\nfull, as well as the big place in the middle of his stomach. Now he is\r\nready to cross the desert.\r\n\r\nAfter many hours all the water in the big place in the middle of the\r\nstomach gets used up. Then what happens? Why, one of the bottles\r\ninside opens its mouth by itself, and pours the water into the\r\nstomach! And after many hours more, when _that_ water has also been\r\nused up, the _second_ bottle opens its mouth and pours the water into\r\nthe stomach. In this way all the bottles or cells inside the camel one\r\nby one pour their water into the stomach from day to day, whenever the\r\ncamel feels thirsty. Is not that most wonderful?\r\n\r\nAnd there is yet another very wonderful thing about the camel. His\r\nhump! It is just as wonderful whether it is one hump or two humps. I\r\nshall tell you.\r\n\r\nThe camel\'s hump is his _store of food_! Yes, just as he carries his\r\nown drinking water inside his stomach, so he also carries his own\r\nstore of food in his hump.\r\n\r\nThis is how he does it:\r\n\r\nWhen the camel is quite well and strong, if he eats any food which is\r\na little more than he actually needs for his hunger, that food after a\r\nwhile goes to his hump and helps to make it bigger. In this way the\r\nhump becomes a store of all the extra food that he has eaten. Then, on\r\ngoing on a long journey through the desert, if the camel has nothing\r\nto eat and begins to feel hungry and weak, a little of the hump is\r\nused up to give him strength, just as if he were to eat a meal. In\r\nthis way he can go for many days without food, but of course his hump\r\nwill get smaller and smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crossing the Desert with Camels]\r\n\r\nBut his master does not actually take him through the desert without\r\ngiving him _any_ food or drink; in fact he always gives the camel some\r\nof the figs and dates which he takes with him for his own meals, and\r\nalso some of the drinking water which he carries on his saddle. But if\r\nit did happen that his master had no food or drink to spare, the camel\r\ncould still live for several days, using his hump for food, and the\r\nwater in the cells of his stomach for drink.\r\n\r\nThe camel can do yet another wonderful thing. He can tell a long way\r\noff when he is coming to a place where there is water. In the desert,\r\nafter going over sand and sand for many days, a traveler sometimes\r\nfinds a beautiful place called an _oasis_. It is just like a lovely\r\nlittle garden right in the middle of the desert, with a spring of\r\nwater, and several fig trees, date trees, and other palm trees growing\r\nall around the pool.\r\n\r\nWhen a traveler is crossing the desert and sees nothing but sand for\r\nseveral days, it sometimes happens that his camel suddenly stops,\r\nstands quite still for a minute, raises his head, and sniffs the air.\r\nThen he turns a little to the right or to the left, and begins to run\r\nstraight that way. His master may look ahead very hard, but he will\r\nsee nothing but sand and sand, as before.\r\n\r\nBut the camel, by just sniffing the air, has found out that there is\r\nan oasis within reach, though it is still too far away for him to see\r\nit. Then he runs on most gladly, and comes to the oasis in an hour, so\r\nthat he and his master can rest there for some time, and drink from\r\nthe pool, and eat the figs and dates growing on the trees.\r\n\r\nOf course, the camel can also eat the leaves of the trees; in fact,\r\nwhen he is not in the desert, but just in the ordinary country, he\r\nusually eats from the shrubs and bushes, and gets figs and dates only\r\nas a dainty, just as you sometimes have ice cream. The camel with two\r\nhumps will gladly eat many more things than the camel with one hump.\r\nIn fact, when he is hungry, he will eat not only any kind of\r\nvegetable, but also meat. He has even been known to chew up and eat\r\nbones, blankets, and leather! And he is perhaps the _only animal that\r\nwill drink salt water_; for the country in which the Two-Humps camel\r\nlives has several lakes, the water of which is bitter and salty.\r\n\r\nSo you see how useful an animal the camel is, whether he has one hump\r\nor two humps. He is so useful that people have been saying for a long\r\ntime that camels should be brought into America, where there are\r\nseveral deserts in the western states. In fact, a strange thing has\r\nalready happened. The United States Government did bring a lot of\r\ncamels for use in the western states several years ago, about the time\r\nwhen your grandfather was a boy.\r\n\r\nBut the people who can best manage such large animals as elephants and\r\ncamels are the people who are born in the same countries as those\r\nanimals and who understand their habits. And unluckily, when the\r\ncamels were brought into America, nobody thought of bringing men also\r\nfrom those countries to manage the camels. So nobody seemed to know\r\nhow to use these animals, and after a time they were turned loose in\r\nArizona. The camels went into the deserts and forests there, and\r\nbecame quite wild, and to-day there are some of them in Arizona.\r\n\r\nNow, do you not think it would be a good idea to get a few men from\r\nthose countries and learn from them how to manage camels? Then the\r\ncamels of Arizona also could be used in crossing the deserts there,\r\nwhere there are no railroads.\r\n\r\nBesides being the only animal that can cross the desert, the camel is\r\ndifferent from any other four-legged animal even in the way he walks.\r\n\r\nYou have seen how a horse walks? When his left foreleg is lifted off\r\nthe ground, his right hind leg is also lifted off the ground; then in\r\nthe next step, when his right foreleg is lifted off the ground, his\r\nleft hind leg is also lifted off the ground. That means that the two\r\nlegs which move at the same time are those placed at the _opposite\r\ncorners_ of his body. But when a camel walks, he lifts the two legs\r\non the _same side_ of his body at the same time. And when he takes the\r\nnext step, he lifts the two legs on the other side of his body.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear, I have told you many things about the camel which are\r\ndifferent from anything in any other animal. So, before I close this\r\nchapter, I want you to remember these things about the camel:\r\n\r\n1. His _foot_ is _padded_ in such a way that he can walk or run on\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n2. He can _close_ his _nostrils_ to keep out the sand in a storm.\r\n\r\n3. His _thick_ and bushy _eyebrows_ and _thick eyelashes_ keep the\r\nglare of the sun from his eyes.\r\n\r\n4. His stomach has many _cells_ like bottles, in which he can _store\r\nup water_.\r\n\r\n5. He can _store up food_ in his _hump_.\r\n\r\n6. He walks by moving both legs on the _same side_ of his body at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nIn another chapter I shall tell you about an animal that can also do\r\none of these things: he can _store up food_ in his body, though in a\r\ndifferent way. That animal is the _bear_. He sleeps through the whole\r\nwinter, and has to have a store of food somewhere in his body to last\r\nall that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThe Camel and the Thief\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I shall tell you a story about a camel and a thief. It is a true\r\nstory, and happened many, many years ago. The story shows what we can\r\nlearn by watching the animals.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a traveler was going on foot across the country. In\r\nhis belt he had a purse full of money. One day, as the sun began to\r\nget hot, he lay down on the grass under a tree near the roadway, and\r\nfell asleep.\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours he woke up, and what was his surprise to find that\r\nthe purse was gone! While he was asleep, somebody had quietly stolen\r\nhis purse and gone away.\r\n\r\nThe traveler ran to the nearest village, and there told the police\r\nabout it. Now, among the police there was a very clever man, and the\r\npolice brought him with them to the place where the money had been\r\nstolen. The clever man looked all around the place very carefully to\r\nsee if he could find any marks on the ground. On the grass near the\r\ntree he found no marks; in fact, if a person walks on the grass just\r\nonce or twice it does not leave any mark. But on the roadway near by\r\nhe found footprints.\r\n\r\n"They are a camel\'s footprints," he said, looking at the marks\r\ncarefully. "And the marks of all the four feet are not quite the same.\r\nThree of them are quite deep and clear; but the fourth one is very\r\nfaint."\r\n\r\nHe followed the camel\'s footprints along the road for a long time. But\r\nnow and again he stopped and looked at the shrubs and bushes which\r\ngrew here and there, on both sides of the road.\r\n\r\n"Hello, that is strange!" he suddenly said. "The camel has eaten from\r\nthe bushes and shrubs here and there on the left side of the road, but\r\nhe hasn\'t eaten at all from those on the right side of the road."\r\n\r\nHe went on for some time longer, then suddenly stopped to look at the\r\nroad where the camel had walked.\r\n\r\n"Hello, this is also strange!" he said. "Here are a lot of _bees_\r\nbuzzing near the ground on the _right_ side of the road. And here are\r\na lot of _ants_ scrambling over the ground on the _left_ side of the\r\nroad."\r\n\r\n"Never mind about the camel, and the bees and the ants," the\r\npolicemen said impatiently. "We want to know about the thief who stole\r\nthe money. You have not found any other footprints except the\r\ncamel\'s?"\r\n\r\n"That is quite true," the clever man said. "But as the _camel_ could\r\nnot steal the money, there must be a _man_ riding on the camel. He\r\nmust be the thief."\r\n\r\n"But why didn\'t the thief leave any footprints?" the policemen asked.\r\n\r\n"Because he must have ridden his camel from the roadway right to the\r\nedge of the grass," the clever man answered. "Then he must have jumped\r\ndown upon the grass, where he knew he would not leave any footprint.\r\nHe must have walked very quietly on the grass up to the tree where the\r\ntraveler was sleeping, and stolen the money. Then he must have walked\r\nback quietly to the camel and ridden off."\r\n\r\n"But what sort of a man is the thief?" the police asked. "How can we\r\nfind him, if you do not tell us what he is like?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you a thing about the thief, or what he looks like, as\r\nhe hasn\'t even left a footprint," the clever man answered. "But I can\r\ntell you _all about the camel_. The camel is _blind_ in his _right\r\neye_, and _lame_ in his _left hind foot_. And on his back he is\r\ncarrying two packages, one on each side; the package on the _right_\r\nside has _honey_ in it, and the package on the _left_ side has _corn_\r\nin it. So you must search for a man who is riding a camel loaded like\r\nthat. He is the thief."\r\n\r\nSo the police searched for a man who was riding a camel which was\r\nblind in his right eye, lame in his left hind foot, and carrying honey\r\nin a package on his right side, and corn in a package on his left\r\nside. After following the camel\'s footprints on the ground for a long\r\ntime, the police at last came to a village.\r\n\r\nThey searched through the village, and found many men riding camels.\r\nBut there was only one man riding a camel blind in his right eye, lame\r\nin left hind foot, and carrying honey on the right side, and corn on\r\nthe left side. So the police knew that he was the thief, and took him\r\nbefore the judge. Then the thief said that it was quite true that he\r\nstole the money.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the judge turned to the clever man and asked him how he\r\nknew all that about the camel.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t _see_ the camel at all, but only his footprints," the\r\njudge said. "Then how did you know that the camel was blind in his\r\nright eye, lame in his left hind foot, and carrying honey on the right\r\nside, and corn on the left side?"\r\n\r\n"It was quite simple," the clever man answered very modestly. "First,\r\nabout the camel being blind in his right eye. He had nibbled at the\r\nshrubs and bushes growing on the left side of the road, for at each\r\nbite I found the leaves cut off clean by his teeth. On the right side\r\nof the road there were also plenty of good shrubs and bushes, but the\r\ncamel had not taken a single bite at any of them. That showed that he\r\ndid not even _see_ those shrubs and bushes on his right side. And that\r\nof course meant that his right eye was blind."\r\n\r\n"That is very clever of you," the judge said. "But how did you know\r\nthat the camel was lame in his left hind foot?"\r\n\r\n"That was just as simple," the clever man again answered very\r\nmodestly. "As the camel walked along, the marks of his two front feet\r\nand right hind foot were quite deep and clear on the ground. But the\r\nmark of his left hind foot was very faint. That showed that the camel\r\nwas limping, and the left hind foot only just touched the ground. So I\r\nknew that he was lame in that foot."\r\n\r\n"That is also very clever of you," the judge said. "But how did you\r\nknow that the camel was carrying honey on his right side, and corn on\r\nhis left?"\r\n\r\n"That was the simplest of all," the clever man answered most modestly.\r\n"As the camel was limping, nearly every step he took jerked the load\r\non his back. So a few drops of the honey fell to the ground from the\r\npackage on his right side, and a few grains of the corn fell to the\r\nground from the package on his left side."\r\n\r\n"But you could not see very well here and there on the ground just a\r\nfew drops of honey or just a few grains of corn?" the judge said.\r\n\r\n"_I_ could not," the clever man answered, "but the _bees_ and the\r\n_ants_ could! On the right side of the road I found a swarm of bees\r\nhere and there; so I knew that they were trying to pick up the honey.\r\nAnd on the left side of the road I saw a whole lot of ants here and\r\nthere; so I knew that they were trying to pick up and carry away the\r\ngrains of corn."\r\n\r\nNow was it not really clever of that man to find all that out about\r\nthe camel, without ever seeing the camel before? But, as you\r\nunderstand, he knew all about the _habits_ of different animals; and\r\nso he knew what camels and bees and ants always do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nBears\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bears_ are such funny animals, at least some kinds of bears, that you\r\nmay like to know all about them.\r\n\r\nBears are found in many countries, and in some countries there are\r\nseveral kinds of bears.\r\n\r\nBut you must remember this: _hardly any bear lives in the tropics_;\r\nthat means countries where the sun is almost overhead all the months\r\nof the year, so that it is very hot all the time.\r\n\r\nBut why does not the bear usually live there? Can you guess?\r\n\r\nBecause the bear is a very _hairy_ animal; and his hair is just like a\r\nthick coat, so that he cannot live where it is very hot all the time.\r\n\r\nOf course, once upon a time the bear lived only in places where it was\r\nvery cold, and so he grew thick hair to keep out the cold; but now\r\nthat he _has_ a thick coat of hair, he cannot go down to hot countries\r\nto live. He does not mind living in a cold country; and the colder the\r\ncountry is, the thicker is his coat of hair.\r\n\r\nWhat does the bear eat? Most kinds of bears eat berries, fruits, soft\r\nroots of trees, and fish when they can catch it. One or two kinds of\r\nbears eat other things also, which I shall tell you about very soon.\r\n\r\nThe bears that live in cold countries, where there is heavy snow in\r\nwinter, cannot get anything at all to eat in winter. Why? Because\r\nthere are no fruits and berries in winter, and the roots of trees are\r\nfrozen hard and covered up by the snow.\r\n\r\nThen if those bears cannot get anything to eat in winter, what do they\r\ndo? They _sleep_!\r\n\r\nYou know that when you are asleep you do not feel hungry; but as soon\r\nas you wake up you feel hungry again. It is just the same with the\r\nbear; he does not feel very hungry while he sleeps. And he _sleeps\r\nright through the winter months_!\r\n\r\nStill, while he is asleep all that time, does he not feel a little bit\r\nhungry? He does. So he uses up the store of food inside his body! I\r\nhave told you that the camel carries a store of food in his hump. The\r\nbear has no hump, of course, but he has a _thick chunk of fat all\r\naround his body_ just under his skin; and that chunk of fat is his\r\n_store of food_.\r\n\r\nSo, when the bear sleeps snugly in his den in the winter months, the\r\nchunk of fat is slowly used up inside his body, and keeps him from\r\nbeing very hungry.\r\n\r\nOf course, he eats such a lot just before the winter, that the chunk\r\nof fat is very thick when he goes to bed. But the chunk is all used up\r\nwhen he wakes up at the end of the winter, and then he is very hungry\r\nagain!\r\n\r\nBut there is a kind of bear that lives in a place where there is snow\r\nand ice almost all the time. What can _he_ do?\r\n\r\nHe cannot sleep always! So he has to get something to eat now and\r\nthen, and I shall tell you how he does that.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Polar Bear_\r\n\r\nThis kind of bear is called the _polar bear_. (See the picture on page\r\n155.) He lives in a place far up North, where it is always very cold.\r\nThe land is nearly covered with snow, and the water at the top of the\r\nsea is frozen. There are no berries or fruits there for the polar bear\r\nto eat; so he has to live on fish, and seal, which is a water animal.\r\nThe way the bear catches the fish or the seal is this:\r\n\r\nHe makes a hole in the ice with his paws, so that he can reach the\r\nwater below. Then he sits down very quietly by the edge of the hole,\r\nand waits for a fish or a seal to swim past the hole. Then the bear\r\npounces on it very quickly with his paw or his jaws, and catches it.\r\n\r\nIf the ice is too thick for the bear to make a hole through it, he has\r\nto try another way. He comes right down to the part of the sea where\r\nsome of the ice has broken off. There he chooses a place at the edge\r\nof the ice, close to the water; and he waits there for a fish or a\r\nseal to swim past. Then he pounces on it and catches it.\r\n\r\nNow I shall tell you a few special things that the polar bear has.\r\n\r\nHis coat of hair is much _thicker_ than the coat of any other bear.\r\nWhy? Because he lives in a colder place than any other bear; so he\r\n_needs_ a thicker coat. Also, he sometimes has to swim through the icy\r\nwater to get to some floating field of ice, so that he can catch fish\r\nfrom it. Then, although his hair gets wet, he has a thick lining of\r\nfat inside his coat to keep him warm.\r\n\r\nThe next special thing about the polar bear is that his hair is _all\r\nwhite_--like the color of everything around him, which, as I have\r\ntold you, is just snow and ice. So when the polar bear sits down very\r\nquietly on the snow and ice, nobody can see him even from a short\r\ndistance, because he is the same color as the snow and ice. And that\r\nis why the fish or the seal does not see him, and so gets caught.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Polar Bear]\r\n\r\nThat is one of the wonderful things about many wild animals--they are\r\nof the _same color as the place where they live_. You know that the\r\ncolor of a lion is yellow, like the color of sand; and the lion lives\r\nin countries where there are lots of sandy places. You know, too, that\r\nthe color of a tiger is yellow, but with black stripes upon the\r\nyellow, so that if you looked at him from a distance, you might think\r\nhe was made up of yellow and black stripes. And the tiger lives in the\r\ntall grass, which also looks like yellow and black stripes.\r\n\r\nBut now I shall tell you more about the polar bear. He has three other\r\nspecial things: the _soles_ of his feet are _hairy_; he has a _small\r\nhead_; and he has a _long neck_.\r\n\r\nFirst, about the soles of his feet. The soles of the feet of other\r\nbears are smooth, just like the feet of all other animals that have to\r\nwalk on ordinary ground. But the soles of the polar bear are covered\r\nwith long hair, just as is his body. Why? Because he has to walk on\r\nice, which is very slippery, and he needs to have the soles of his\r\nfeet covered with hair, or else he would slip on the ice, just as you\r\nmust wear rubbers over your shoes when you have to walk on icy ground.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear, just stop for a minute, and think. Among all the\r\nwonderful things that I have told you so far, you have always noticed\r\nthat an animal always has _just the very thing he needs! We_ have to\r\n_make_ rubbers, and warm coats, and gloves, and socks, and a dozen\r\nthings that we need. But to every animal God has given everything\r\nthat he needs, right on his body.\r\n\r\nBut now let us go on with the polar bear. He has a smaller head than\r\nany other kind of bear. Why? To make it easier for him to put his head\r\nthrough the hole in the ice, when he is catching fish. Other kinds of\r\nbears do not have to put their heads into a hole to get anything to\r\neat; so they do not need to have a small head.\r\n\r\nThe polar bear has also a longer neck than any other kind of bear.\r\nWhy? To give him a longer reach in catching the fish with his\r\njaws--without tumbling into the water himself. Other bears, who live\r\non dry land, do not need to reach out like that, and so they have\r\nshorter necks.\r\n\r\nI shall now tell you about these other kinds of bears.\r\n\r\n\r\n_American Bears_\r\n\r\nFirst you shall hear about the bears that live in America. The biggest\r\nkind is called the _grizzly bear_. In fact, he is the largest bear in\r\nthe world. Some grizzly bears are ten feet tall when they stand up on\r\ntheir hind legs!\r\n\r\nThe color of a grizzly bear is yellow, but with many shades;\r\nsometimes between brown and yellow, and sometimes between red and\r\nyellow. Teddy bears, with which you have played, are sometimes made of\r\nthat color. Teddy bears of course are very nice, as they are toys; but\r\nI am sorry to say that the real grizzly bear is not nice; he is very\r\nfierce. In fact, he is the only kind of bear that is so fierce. Even\r\ngrown-up men do not want to go near him.\r\n\r\nThe grizzly is found in many parts of North America, near the Rocky\r\nMountains, from the United States right up to Alaska. He lives on\r\nberries and all kinds of fruits, and also on the soft roots of trees.\r\nBut the grizzly bear eats meat also, if he can manage to catch deer or\r\ncattle. That is why cowboys in Colorado and Wyoming do not like the\r\ngrizzly bear--he tries to kill and eat their cows.\r\n\r\nBesides, he kills a lot of fish. In the Columbia River in Oregon there\r\nare lots of trout and shad, which people like to have for their\r\ndinner. But the grizzly bear gets to the river first, and eats a great\r\nmany of the trout and the shad. How does he catch the fish? Why, he\r\njust lies down along the bank, and waits for the fish to rise to the\r\ntop of the water. The trout and the shad like to rise to the top of\r\nthe water now and again, and swim there. So the grizzly just waits\r\nfor a fish to rise--and then he pounces on it and catches it with his\r\npaw. He is so very quick that he hardly ever misses. All kinds of\r\nbears are very clever in catching fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Bears_\r\n\r\nAnother kind of bear is called the _brown bear_. He lives in Europe,\r\nAsia, and also in some parts of America, especially in Alaska. There\r\nhe is rather big, though not quite so big as the grizzly bear. He too\r\nlives on berries, fruits, and roots, and he also catches fish. For in\r\nthe rivers of Alaska there are lots of salmon.\r\n\r\nBut the brown bear is not at all fierce, like the grizzly bear. He is\r\npeace-loving, and sometimes quite friendly.\r\n\r\nThe nicest kind of bear is called the _black bear_. He is found in all\r\nparts of the United States, and in many other countries. He is\r\nsometimes rather small, and is quite full of fun. Almost all the good\r\nstories you may hear about bears are about the black bear.\r\n\r\nMany people mistake the black bear for the brown bear; so when you\r\nsometimes hear people talking about a "brown" bear, you may know that\r\nthey really mean a "black" bear.\r\n\r\nLike other bears, the black bear lives on berries, fruits, and roots,\r\nand also on nuts, if he can find any. But what he likes best is honey!\r\nIt is quite amusing to see the bear hold a honeycomb in one paw, scoop\r\nout the honey with the other, and put it into his mouth. It looks just\r\nlike a boy holding a pot of jam in one hand, and sticking his fingers\r\ninto the jam and putting it on his tongue!\r\n\r\n"But do not the bees get angry, and try to sting him?" you may ask.\r\n\r\nOf course they do. The bees swarm around the bear and try to sting him\r\nall over. But they cannot! He is _too hairy_! They cannot get through\r\nthe hair to sting him on the skin. So he goes on licking the honey and\r\nsmacking his lips!\r\n\r\nThe black bear is always a funny animal. Perhaps you have seen him in\r\nthe zoo. He will squat on the ground like a man, and if he sees a\r\ncrowd of people before him, he will swing his arms just as a man does\r\nwhen he talks to a friend. Perhaps the bear has seen some men do that,\r\nand has learned to do the same!\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes he will sit on the ground, hold his tail in his mouth,\r\nand fumble head over heels, or roll over and over, or spin round and\r\nround--just for fun! In fact, the black bear is among the _few\r\ngrown-up animals that love to play_. Many _young_ animals of course,\r\nsuch as kittens, puppy dogs, calves, and many others, love to play.\r\nBut most grown-up animals do not seem to care for play, except the\r\nblack bear.\r\n\r\nWhen he is caught and tamed, he is still very playful at times. He\r\nwill do all sorts of funny tricks, all by himself; and if he sees\r\nanyone watching him, he will try to show how clever he is--just like a\r\nchild playing "smarty!"\r\n\r\nOnce in a lumber camp in the West the men caught and tamed a black\r\nbear. After a time the bear was allowed to walk about the camp, quite\r\nfree, as he did not think of running away. One day the men had stopped\r\nwork to have their dinner. The bear walked by, and the men petted him\r\nand said nice things to him. Then what do you think happened! The bear\r\nfelt so proud of being praised that he went to a sloping log, and\r\nwalked along it right to the top. You must know that in a lumber camp\r\nthere are lots and lots of huge logs, or trees which the men have cut\r\ndown. And one of these logs happened to rest on a slope, that is, with\r\none end higher than the other.\r\n\r\nWhen the bear reached the top of the log, he sat across it. Then he\r\nheld on to the log with his front paws, bent his body, and slid down\r\nthe log--just as a boy slides down the banister! Of course the men\r\nlaughed, and cheered him. Then just guess what that bear did!\r\n\r\nHe walked up to the top of the log again, and sat across it, as\r\nbefore. But now he held on to the log with his knees, not his paws,\r\nand sat straight up without bending, and slid down the log in that\r\nway--just as a boy might hold on to the banister with his knees, not\r\nusing his hands at all, and slide down the banister in that way, just\r\nto show how smart he could be!\r\n\r\nYou may be sure those men cheered the bear, and gave him lots to eat.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of black bear that is also funny, though in\r\nanother way. He is called the _Himalayan black bear_, because he lives\r\nin India near some huge mountains called the Himalayas. In many ways\r\nhe is very much like the black bear of America, but he has a _white\r\nchin_ and _long side-whiskers on his jaws_. Some people think that of\r\nall kinds of bears he is the most handsome.\r\n\r\nAlthough he often goes up very high on the side of the mountains, he\r\nsometimes comes down to the country below, where there are many\r\nvillages. But the bear is quite friendly, and never hurts the people\r\nin the villages, although he is strong enough to kill a man. So the\r\npeople are also very kind and friendly to him, and never try to hurt\r\nhim. When you grow up you may read that there are some people in India\r\nwho are always kind to _all_ animals, tame or wild.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _To the Teacher._--Please explain to the class that the\r\nsect called Jains do not hurt the smallest creature, and will suffer\r\nthe sting of a wasp rather than kill it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Himalayan Black Bear]\r\n\r\nI am telling you this because you will see very soon what we gain by\r\nbeing friendly even to a wild animal. The Himalayan black bear, like\r\nthe other black bear, is also very fond of honey, and of everything\r\nsweet. In the country where he lives there grows a berry called mawa,\r\nwhich is very sweet--even sweeter than the strawberry; and the people\r\nof the villages make jam from it.\r\n\r\nThese berries grow quite wild, on bushes here and there in the fields,\r\nand even in the jungles near by. When the berries are ripe, the people\r\nsend out their children to gather them from the bushes in the fields;\r\nand the children carry baskets so as to bring back as many berries as\r\nthey can.\r\n\r\nBut when the berries are ripe, the bears also want to eat them! So it\r\nsometimes happens that half a dozen children are picking the berries\r\nfrom a thick bush, when suddenly a bear comes round the bush and\r\nstarts gobbling up the berries as fast as he can!\r\n\r\nDo the children get frightened and run away? Not a bit! They want\r\n_their_ share of the berries, too!\r\n\r\nBy this time the bush may be getting empty, and the children have not\r\nquite filled their baskets. The bear keeps on gobbling up the berries,\r\nand even pushing past the children to get at a bunch. What then? Why,\r\nthe children raise their hands, and _just spank the wild bear_!\r\n\r\n"Go away, you have had enough!" they say. "Can\'t you go to another\r\nbush? There must be others right in the jungle, where _we_ can\'t go!"\r\n\r\nAnd, can you imagine it, a wild bear there has never hurt a child!\r\nWhen the children spank him and push him away, telling him that he has\r\nhad enough from that bush, he _does_ go away to some other bush. Of\r\ncourse, the spanking does not really hurt him.\r\n\r\nI have told this to you, my dear, just to show you that there is never\r\nany real reason for quarreling and fighting, among children, or even\r\namong men. _If children and wild bears can get along together_, why\r\ncannot children and children, or men and men, or nations and nations?\r\nSurely there are enough berries and other good things for all, if we\r\nonly look around!\r\n\r\nRemember this always, even when you grow up, if you want to be good\r\nmen and women, and good citizens of your country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nBears: The Tricky Trap\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I am going to tell you something funny about the bear. You have\r\nseen lots of wild animals in the zoo, and you may sometimes have\r\nwondered how these animals were caught. In another book I shall tell\r\nyou all about the different ways of catching different kinds of wild\r\nanimals; but now I shall only tell you how a wild bear is caught. Of\r\ncourse, there are two or three ways of catching him alive, but I shall\r\ndescribe to you now just one way.\r\n\r\nYou must know by this time that everybody in the world--whether man,\r\nwoman, or child--has _some fault_. Some have a bad temper, others are\r\nrude, and still others are obstinate; and many, especially children,\r\nare too greedy! And so it is among animals: they all have one fault or\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nSo the people who want to catch a wild animal find out first what\r\nfault that kind of animal has--whether he is greedy, or obstinate, or\r\nbad tempered. And they _catch the animal because of that very fault_!\r\n\r\nA bear is very obstinate; in fact the bear, the pig, the donkey, and\r\nthe mule are among the most obstinate of animals. So, because the bear\r\nis very obstinate, he will never give up when he meets anything that\r\nblocks his way; and if he has made up his mind to do anything, he will\r\nnever give up, even if he finds he _cannot_ do it and that it is very\r\nfoolish to try to do it.\r\n\r\nSo the people remember the bear\'s obstinacy, and catch him in this\r\nway:\r\n\r\nThey find a large tree which has a bough fifteen or twenty feet from\r\nthe ground; then they tie a pot of honey on the bough, quite two or\r\nthree yards away from the fork where the bough joins the trunk. So, if\r\na bear wants to get at the honey, he will have to climb up the trunk,\r\nand then walk along the bough to the place where the pot is tied.\r\n\r\nBut the people also take a heavy stone, tie a stout rope around it,\r\nand hang up the stone by the rope from another bough higher up. They\r\nplace the stone in such a way that it swings right in front of the\r\nhoney and a little above it. Then the people hide in thickets near by.\r\n\r\nPresently a bear smells the honey from a distance, and comes to find\r\nit. On reaching the place he sees the pot of honey on the tree. As\r\nthe bear is a good climber, he soon scrambles up the trunk of the tree\r\nand walks along the bough toward the honey.\r\n\r\nBut just as he is coming to it, he sees something right before his\r\npath. It is the block of stone! And he cannot get at the honey without\r\npushing the stone aside. So, what does he do? Why, quite naturally he\r\npushes the stone aside with his paw. But, as I have told you, the\r\nstone is hung up by a rope; and so it _swings_ any way you may push\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThen what happens? Why, as soon as the bear pushes the stone aside\r\nwith his paw, the stone _swings back_ and hits him on the paw. The\r\nbear gives a growl, and again pushes the stone aside, and this time\r\nharder than before.\r\n\r\nThen what happens? The stone swings back and hits the bear harder than\r\nbefore! In fact, the stone will always swing back just as hard as it\r\nis pushed.\r\n\r\nBut the bear does not know that! So with another growl he pushes the\r\nstone again--and now much harder than before. Then of course the stone\r\ncomes back much harder, and whacks him again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Bear Fighting a Block of Stone]\r\n\r\nThis makes the bear really angry. He hits at the stone, and sends it\r\nflying through the air in a big curve. But when the stone has gone\r\nup and up in that curve, it begins to come down, down, the same\r\nway--and gives the bear a thumping whack on the jaw.\r\n\r\nNow, if the bear were not such an obstinate animal, he would go away\r\nafter that third blow, and try to forget the honey. But the bear will\r\nnever, never, give in! Instead, he gets quite mad with rage. He thinks\r\nsome enemy is hiding behind the stone!\r\n\r\n"Who is hitting me?" he growls. "Come out of that, and fight fair!"\r\n\r\nWith that he hits a frantic blow at the stone; for the bear is a good\r\nboxer. He sends the stone swinging through the air again, and farther\r\nthan before. Again the stone swings back and gives the bear a hard\r\nwhack.\r\n\r\nIn this way the fight goes on. Of course the stone cannot get hurt; so\r\nit is the bear that gets hurt, every time. And as he will never give\r\nin, he goes on fighting with the stone, and gets hurt more and more,\r\ntill at last he is knocked right off the tree, and falls stunned to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nThen the clever people rush in from their hiding place, throw a net\r\nover the bear, and carry him away. And that is how the zoo gets some\r\nof its bears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nBright Birds\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I shall tell you something about birds; not ordinary birds, but a\r\nspecial sort.\r\n\r\nOf course, birds are not exactly animals of the kind that I have been\r\ntelling you about, as they have only two legs, instead of four. But\r\nthey have two wings, which are more useful to them than two more legs.\r\n\r\nIf they had four legs they could run fast; but with the two wings they\r\ncan fly, which is ever so much faster and better than running. And\r\nthey still have two legs with which to stand on the ground, when they\r\nhave to come down to rest or to feed.\r\n\r\nThe birds that I am going to tell you about live wild in the jungle,\r\nand are free to build their nests where they like.\r\n\r\nAmong the birds we like best, some can _sing_, and some have _bright\r\nfeathers_. Those that sing may live near your own homes in the\r\ncountry--the lark, the thrush, the nightingale, and some others. But\r\nthe birds that have bright feathers live generally in other countries.\r\n\r\n_Most birds that have lovely voices do not have bright feathers_; and\r\n_most birds that have lovely feathers cannot sing_.\r\n\r\nSo among animals everything is very fair and just. With us it\r\nsometimes _seems_ different. Some children appear to have all the good\r\nluck, and others all the bad luck. Some children can sing well, and\r\nare also very pretty; others cannot sing at all, and are also plain to\r\nlook at. But really things are not quite so unfair; for a child who is\r\nplain, and cannot sing, may still have _some other gift_.\r\n\r\nAmong birds, those that can sing you may have seen often enough near\r\nyour own homes in the country; so I shall now tell you about the birds\r\nthat have bright feathers.\r\n\r\nMost birds with bright feathers live in hot countries, where it is\r\n_sunny_ almost the whole year. In fact, it is the bright light of the\r\nsun in those countries that gives the colors to the feathers of the\r\nbirds, which are as lovely as the colors of the rainbow.\r\n\r\nAmong the bright birds that live quite wild in the jungles of hot\r\ncountries, the most beautiful are the _flamingo_, the _parrot_, the\r\n_cockatoo_, the _peacock_, the _golden pheasant_, the _egret_, and a\r\nfew others.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Flamingo_\r\n\r\nI shall tell you first about the flamingos, as they _live together in\r\nflocks_. They were once found in America, and only a few years ago\r\nthere were many flocks of them in Florida, but now there are very few\r\nleft in this country. They are now found in Africa and in the\r\ncountries of southern Asia; a few are found also in Europe.\r\n\r\nThis is the way the flamingos live. They choose a place in the jungle\r\nwhere there is a lake or a river, and build their nests all around the\r\nlake, or by the bank of the river. The nest is just a heap of mud\r\nraised up from the ground, with a hollow at the top where the mother\r\nbird lays her eggs. Sometimes many thousands of flamingos are found\r\ntogether around one place, which is then called a _flamingo colony_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Flamingo Colony\r\nPhotograph of a group in the American Museum of Natural History, New York]\r\n\r\nThe flamingo is a very tall bird, taller than a man when standing up.\r\nThe flamingo\'s legs are long and thin, and the neck is also long. The\r\nlong neck and the long legs are very useful to him. He stands in the\r\nwater on his legs, which look almost like a pair of stilts; then he\r\nbends down his long neck, dips his beak into the water, and catches a\r\nfish or any other small creature that he can find there. And although\r\nthe fish or the small creature sees the flamingo\'s legs in the water,\r\nit does not run away. Why? Because it mistakes the legs for reeds\r\ngrowing in the water!\r\n\r\nWhen thousands of flamingos in a colony are standing around the lake\r\nor by the river, where they live, it is a very grand sight from a\r\ndistance. The flamingo\'s feathers are a bright red in color, with\r\nwhite or pink at the edges; so the thousands of flamingos look like an\r\narmy of soldiers with red coats.\r\n\r\nIn former years, when soldiers sometimes wore red coats, travelers who\r\nhappened to come toward a lake in Africa would suddenly see at a\r\ndistance an army of soldiers, as they thought, standing by the lake.\r\nWhat they really saw were the flamingos fishing!\r\n\r\nBut no traveler could get very near the flamingos, for they have\r\n_sentinels_! I have told you that the wild buffaloes have sentinels to\r\nwarn them when an enemy is coming. The flamingos have the same. Their\r\nsentinels stand here and there just outside the place where the others\r\nare fishing; and they keep a lookout all the time. If any enemy\r\ncomes, they cry out,\r\n\r\n"Honk! Honk! Honk!" That means, "Enemy coming! Fly away!"\r\n\r\nAnd of course all the flamingos rise up in the air and fly away to a\r\nsafe place, till the enemy goes away.\r\n\r\nTo see a whole flock of flamingos flying in the sky far above one\'s\r\nhead is a most wonderful sight. You have seen a cloud at sunset\r\nshining with lovely tints of red and pink and orange: well, the flock\r\nof flamingos flying in the sky looks something like that. And they all\r\n_keep level_ at the same great height, in _rows and ranks_, just like\r\nan army, as there are thousands and thousands of flamingos in the\r\nflock.\r\n\r\nSometimes the rows and ranks widen out for a few minutes, and fill a\r\nlarge portion of the sky; then they close up again, and look like one\r\nlong banner of red floating in the sky.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time they have sentinels that fly outside the rows and\r\nranks. They make the pattern in the sky still more beautiful.\r\n\r\nMy dear children, the more you think of these wonders of the jungle\r\nand of the world, the more you will understand how great and wise is\r\nGod, Who made all these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Parrot_\r\n\r\nAnother bright bird that lives in the jungle in a flock is the\r\n_parrot_. You know all about him, as you must have often seen him\r\ncaged, or chained by the leg to a stand. But he is different in his\r\nhappy home in the jungle. He lives in almost every sunny country, and\r\nflies about in flocks.\r\n\r\nWild parrots also make their nests in flocks. In India there is a\r\ndeserted city called Amber. Once upon a time a great King lived there\r\nin a lovely marble palace; and the nobles and courtiers also had\r\nlovely marble palaces and mansions.\r\n\r\nBut one day the King said that they must all leave that city, and go\r\nand build another city. So everybody left the city of Amber, and\r\nto-day it still stands perfect--lovely marble palaces and mansions,\r\nwith hundreds of bushes of wild roses growing all around them.\r\n\r\nNobody lives there, except thousands and thousands of wild parrots,\r\nthat have made their nests upon the roofs of the palaces, in the\r\nporticoes and balconies, and upon the tops of the marble pillars and\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nJust think of that lovely sight! The blue sky above, the red roses on\r\nthe ground below, and the white marble palaces between the blue sky\r\nand the red roses; and many thousands of green parrots flitting across\r\nthe sky, and from palace to rose bush. Broad bands of red, white, and\r\nblue, with bright flashes of green between them!\r\n\r\nAnother lovely sight is a flock of wild parrots in the jungle, going\r\nhome to roost at sunset. I once saw that sight. Their beautiful green\r\nwings and the patches of yellow on their heads shone amidst the\r\ngorgeous colors of the sunset. And as the parrots flew on and on, many\r\nthousands of them, their own colors mingled with the colors of the\r\nsunset in ever-changing bands. They flew toward the setting sun, and\r\npassed out of sight right into the sun, as it were.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing a sight like that--seeing God\'s lovely creatures flying\r\nabout like happy children at play--who wants to see a bird boxed up in\r\na cage?\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cockatoo_\r\n\r\nAnother bright bird which you may have seen in a cage, or chained to a\r\nstand, is the _cockatoo_. He is a cousin of the parrot, but much\r\nlarger, and far more gorgeous. He has a beautiful _crest_ of red and\r\norange feathers on his head. His wings are a rosy pink in color; and\r\nhe has a long pink and white tail.\r\n\r\nIn other ways he is very much like the parrot. He lives chiefly in the\r\ncountries of southern Asia, and in the islands between Asia and\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Peacock_\r\n\r\nAnd now I come to the most beautiful bird of all, the _peacock_. When\r\nhe spreads out his long tail, it looks just like a lady\'s fan, only\r\nfar lovelier than any fan made by men. In color the tail is a kind of\r\nblue and green, with touches of gold and violet, and with "eyes"\r\ndotted all over it in shades of many other colors.\r\n\r\nThe peacock can also close up his tail like a fan. Then the long\r\nfeathers of the tail all come together in many folds, and stand out a\r\nyard long behind him.\r\n\r\nThe peacock is found wild in India and in countries near there, but\r\nhas now been brought into America and Europe. You may even have seen\r\nthe peacock in the parks and gardens of some cities, where he lives\r\nquite peacefully, at least in the summer months. In the winter, of\r\ncourse, he must have a warm place indoors.\r\n\r\nThe peacock is really the Papa bird, and the Mamma bird is called the\r\n_peahen_. She has not the gorgeous tail and the lovely feathers that\r\nhe has; so she looks quite plain. You will find that _among animals\r\nthe Papas are often much prettier than the Mammas_.\r\n\r\nThat seems very strange, does it not? Among us, of course, the Mammas\r\nare always prettier than the Papas!\r\n\r\nBut in another book I shall explain _why_ the Papas among animals are\r\noften prettier than the Mammas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Golden Pheasant_\r\n\r\nThere is another beautiful bird which has been brought to America, and\r\nnow lives here; it is the _golden pheasant_. Once upon a time he lived\r\nonly in China; but a few years ago people brought a number of golden\r\npheasants to America, and put them in the forests of Oregon and\r\nWashington. So now there are many thousands of golden pheasants flying\r\nabout and making their nests there.\r\n\r\nThere are other kinds of pheasants in England and in some parts of\r\nEurope, and these the people shoot and eat. But the golden pheasant is\r\nmuch too beautiful to eat. His feathers are as lovely as the\r\nsunset--gold and yellow and orange, with blue and deep crimson; and\r\nall these colors are laid out on his feathers in such a beautiful\r\npattern that to look at him you would think you were dreaming, and not\r\nlooking at a real bird.\r\n\r\nMan, who toils with his hands, cannot make such lovely colors as those\r\nof the birds of the air, and of the flowers in the fields, which do\r\nnot toil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Snowy Egret_\r\n\r\nAnd now, my dear children, I shall finish this chapter by telling you\r\nabout a beautiful bird that once lived quite wild in great numbers in\r\nthe United States. This bird has lovely soft feathers, which are pure\r\nwhite; so it is called the _snowy egret_. The feathers are as soft as\r\nsilk. They are also long, with a gentle droop at the end.\r\n\r\nBecause these feathers are so lovely, rich women want to wear them in\r\ntheir hats; and these rich women are willing to pay a great deal of\r\nmoney for the egret feathers. So, for the sake of the money, hunters\r\ngo wherever these lovely birds are to be found, and catch and kill\r\nthem, and get the feathers. In fact, they have killed off so many of\r\nthese lovely birds, to get feathers for rich women\'s hats, that to-day\r\nthere are hardly any snowy egrets left in the United States.\r\n\r\nWorse than that, the hunters killed the Papa and Mamma egrets just\r\nwhen their babies were born, because at that time the feathers of the\r\nsnowy egrets were the softest and loveliest. And so, for each Papa and\r\nMamma egret which the cruel hunters killed, they left a dozen _baby\r\nbirds in their nests to starve and die_. Think of that!\r\n\r\nNow, my dear children, I want the little girls among you to remember\r\nthis, especially the little girls who are lucky enough to have rich\r\nPapas and Mammas. You can grow up to be beautiful, and look beautiful,\r\nwithout wearing these egret feathers. There are women who try to look\r\nbeautiful, but who do not think of the pain they give to God\'s\r\ninnocent creatures.\r\n\r\nSo, if ever you want to wear egret feathers, think of the dozen baby\r\negrets who must starve and die if you are to have them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Snowy Egrets\r\nPhotograph of a group in the American Museum of Natural History, New York]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nThe Caged Parrot\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall finish this book by telling you a story--a true story, which,\r\nI hope, will make you think.\r\n\r\nMany years ago a sea captain returned to his home in the north of\r\nScotland, after sailing the sea for a long time. He brought with him a\r\nparrot. The parrot had lived in South America, where the people speak\r\nthe Spanish language. So all the words the parrot knew were in\r\nSpanish.\r\n\r\nThe captain knew Spanish quite well, and often talked to the parrot in\r\nthat language. But after a time the captain died, and there was nobody\r\nin that part of Scotland who could talk to the parrot.\r\n\r\nThe parrot grew silent, and never opened his mouth to say a word. But\r\nhe was thinking of his friend who was dead, and whose words in Spanish\r\nhad reminded him of his sunny home. The people around him did not know\r\nthat, and thought nothing of his silence. So the parrot in his cold\r\nand bleak cage pined and pined for his sunny home land, but never a\r\nword did he say.\r\n\r\nForty years passed, and a new set of people came to live there. They\r\ntook no notice of the silent old parrot. They put food and drink in\r\nthe cage, but knew nothing about him except that he had been in the\r\ncage for many years. For a parrot lives much longer than a\r\nman--sometimes one hundred years.\r\n\r\nOne day a sailor came to the house. He had lived in South America, and\r\nknew Spanish. He saw the parrot sitting in his cage, all alone and\r\nsilent, with his head bent down, and his beak on his breast. Then the\r\nsailor spoke to the parrot in Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe parrot looked up, as if he had awakened from a long, long dream.\r\nSomething reminded him of the days of his youth, when he was a happy\r\nbird flying about over the sunny fields of South America. Then he\r\nremembered the language of his youth, which he had not spoken for\r\nforty years.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he flapped his wings in joy, and spoke again. He spoke all\r\nthe Spanish words he knew, one after another. He spoke to that sailor\r\nas to a friend come to him from his own home land. He flapped his\r\nwings against the bars, and finally dropped to the floor of the cage,\r\ndead. He had died in the thought of his bygone happy days.\r\n\r\nMy dear children, I am closing this book with this story, because I\r\nwant you to learn a great lesson from it: _be kind to all animals_.\r\n\r\nI know that you would never willfully hurt any animal. But that is not\r\nenough. You may think that you are very kind to some creature, because\r\nyou feed it and pet it; but all the same you may be very cruel, though\r\nyou do not mean to be so.\r\n\r\nYou may think it is great fun to have a pretty bird in a cage. But is\r\nit any fun _for the bird_? How would _you_ like to be shut up in a\r\ncage all your life, instead of playing about in God\'s free air and\r\nliving in your own home? The bird wants to fly about and live in his\r\nnest in his own home land. Think of that when you wish to put a bird\r\nin a cage.\r\n\r\nChildren who are kind to all animals grow up to be men and women who\r\nare kind to other people. And it is only by being kind to others that\r\nwe ourselves _deserve_ to be happy and _are_ happy.\r\n\r\nRemember all that I have said, till I come back and talk to you again\r\nin the next book. Then I shall tell you many more Wonders of the\r\nJungle.\r\n\r\nTill then, as they say in the Orient, God and His peace be with you!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Wonders of the Jungle, by Prince Sarath Ghosh\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WONDERS OF THE JUNGLE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 24852.txt or 24852.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/8/5/24852/\r\n\r\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Chris Curnow, Joseph Cooper,\r\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\r\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
