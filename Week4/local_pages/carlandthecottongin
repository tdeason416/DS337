"You never seem to\r\ncome when you\'re wanted. Drat the child! Where is he? Carl!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Ma."\r\n\r\n"_Yes, Ma!_ _Yes, Ma!_" the woman mimicked impatiently. "It\'s easy\r\nenough to shout _Yes, Ma_; but where are you--that\'s what I want to\r\nknow. You\'re the slowest creature on God\'s earth, I believe. A tortoise\r\nwould be a race horse compared with you. What under the sun are you\r\ndoing?"\r\n\r\nThe boy entered, a good-humored grin on his face.\r\n\r\nHe was thin, lanky, and blue-eyed, and a rebellious lock of tawny hair\r\nthat curled despite all he could do waved back from his forehead. He\r\nmight have been fourteen years old or he might have been seventeen; it\r\nwas hard to tell whether he was an overgrown younger boy or an\r\nunder-sized older one. Whatever his age, however, he could certainly\r\nboast a serene disposition, for his mother\'s caustic comments failed to\r\nruffle his temper. Having heard them ever since babyhood he was quite\r\naccustomed to their acid tang; moreover, he had learned to gage them\r\nfor what they were worth and class them along with the froth on a soda\r\nor the sputter of a freshly lighted match. The thing underneath was\r\nwhat mattered and he knew well that beneath the torrent of words his\r\nmother was the best mother on earth, so what more could a boy ask?\r\n\r\nTherefore he stood before her, whistling softly and waiting to see what\r\nwould happen next. For something surely would happen; it always did\r\nwhen Mrs. McGregor rolled up her sleeves, and they were rolled up now,\r\ndisplaying beneath the margin of blue gingham a powerful arm\r\nterminating in a strong hand and slender, capable fingers.\r\n\r\nYears ago she had come to Mulberry Court with a large brood of children\r\nand it had been a long time before she could number one friend among\r\nher neighbors. The chief complaint entered against her was that she was\r\nnot sociable, and if you were not sociable at Mulberry Court it meant\r\nyou were lofty, uppish, considered yourself better than other folks.\r\nWhat it really meant, however, was that you did not hang out of your\r\nwindow and chatter to the inhabitant of the opposite tenement; or\r\nloiter in the doorway or on the sidewalk to gossip with the women who\r\nlived on the floors below.\r\n\r\nAt the outset Mrs. McGregor had let it be understood that she had no\r\ntime for gossip and it was this decree that had earned for her the\r\nstigma of not being sociable, the acme of all crimes at Mulberry Court.\r\nOf course she had not proclaimed her policy in so many words. No,\r\nindeed! Yet she might as well have done so for the business-like manner\r\nin which she hastened home from market and shot up the stairs published\r\nher philosophy more forcefully than any words could have done.\r\n\r\n"She\'s just too good for the rest of us," announced Mrs. O\'Dowd\r\nsarcastically to the little circle who were wont to await her verdict\r\non every newcomer to the district. "Proud and snappy and stuck-up, I\r\ncall her. Not much of an addition to the house, if you ask my opinion."\r\n\r\nThis snapshot judgment, hasty as it was, was promptly accepted by the\r\nother women, for was not Julie O\'Dowd the social dictator of the\r\ncommunity? Had she ever been known to be wrong? With one accord\r\nMulberry Court turned its back on the new arrival who so flagrantly\r\ndefied the etiquette of the place.\r\n\r\nIndeed had not Mrs. O\'Dowd\'s baby fallen ill the seal of disapproval\r\nput on Mrs. McGregor might have rested on her all her days, and she and\r\nher entire family been completely ostracized by the neighborhood. But\r\nlittle Joey O\'Dowd, the youngest of Julie\'s flock, was seized with\r\npneumonia, and although the flock was a large one Julie was too genuine\r\na mother to feel she could spare one out of her fold. Was not Joey the\r\nlittlest of all, the pet of her household? All the motherhood in her\r\nrevolted at the thought of losing him. Strangely enough until the\r\npresent moment she had escaped great crises with her children. She was\r\nwell schooled in the ways of whooping cough, measles, and chicken pox\r\nand could do up a cut finger with almost professional skill; but in the\r\nface of crucial illness she was like a warrior without weapons.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed with terror, therefore, by the immediate calamity, she did\r\nin benumbed fashion everything the doctor directed and still Joey was\r\nno better; if anything he grew steadily worse. Motionless he lay in his\r\ncrib, his great staring eyes giving forth no flicker of recognition.\r\nThere was not much hope, the neighbors whispered, after they had\r\ntiptoed in to look at him and tiptoed out again. He was as good as\r\ngone. Julie could never save him in the world.\r\n\r\nThe whispers, humanely muffled, did not reach the panic-stricken mother\r\nbut she was not blind to the despairing head-shaking and these suddenly\r\nawakened her to the realization that according to general opinion the\r\nbattle she was waging was a losing one. It was a terrible discovery.\r\nWhat should she do? She must do something. Wild-eyed she plunged into\r\nthe hall, a vague impulse to seek help moving her; and it was just as\r\nshe paused irresolute at the head of the stairs that she came face to\r\nface with Mrs. McGregor ascending to her fifth-floor flat.\r\n\r\nNow Mrs. McGregor was a born nurse, whose skill had been increased by\r\nconstant practice. With a wisdom that amounted almost to genius she had\r\nbrought her large family through many an appalling conflict and emerged\r\nvictorious. Sickness, therefore, had no terrors for her. Instantly the\r\nmother in her read and interpreted the desperation in Julie\'s face and\r\nwithout a word she slipped through the open door into the room where\r\nJoey lay. One glance of her experienced eye showed that there was\r\nplenty to be done. The interior was close and untidy, for Mrs. O\'Dowd\r\nin her distraction had cast aside every consideration but her baby.\r\n\r\nMrs. McGregor stooped down over the crib.\r\n\r\nWhat she saw there or did not see she at least kept to herself, and\r\nwhen she straightened up it was to meet the searching gaze of her\r\nneighbor with a grave smile.\r\n\r\n"He\'s going to die," moaned Julie, wringing her hands. "He is going to\r\ndie--my baby--and I can\'t help it!"\r\n\r\nAlthough for a long time the two women had lived beneath the same roof,\r\nthese were the first words Mrs. O\'Dowd had ever addressed to Mrs.\r\nMcGregor.\r\n\r\n"Might I touch him?" the latter inquired gently.\r\n\r\nLike a suspicious animal Julie stiffened jealously.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not hurt him," Mrs. McGregor hastened to say, not taking offense\r\nat the other\'s attitude. "I just want to raise him up so he can breathe\r\nbetter." Then she added reassuringly, "I\'d not give up if I were you.\r\nYou must keep on fighting to the very last minute. There is much we can\r\ndo yet to make him comfortable."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"We can bathe him a little for one thing, if you would heat some\r\nwater."\r\n\r\nDumbly Julie turned to obey.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a big family of my own," went on Mrs. McGregor in matter-of-fact\r\nfashion, "and I\'ve seen so many children pull through when they looked\r\nfit to die that I\'ve learned never to quit hoping. You\'ll get nowhere\r\nin a fight if you haven\'t courage."\r\n\r\n"I had courage enough at first," whispered the baby\'s mother in a\r\nshaking voice, "but I\'ve lost my nerve now. I\'m frightened--and--and\r\ntired."\r\n\r\nTears came into her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Of course you are," came with quick sympathy from Mrs. McGregor. "We\r\nall are apt to lose our nerve when we are worn out. I don\'t wonder\r\nyou\'re tired. You\'ve had no sleep day or night, I\'ll be bound."\r\n\r\n"Not much. The neighbors were kind about offering but somehow I\r\ncouldn\'t leave Joey with \'em. Besides, how can you sleep when you are\r\nworried half out of your mind?"\r\n\r\n"I know! I know!" nodded the other woman. "Still you can\'t go on\r\nforever without rest. Next you know you will be down sick yourself and\r\nthen where will your baby be--to say nothing of your other children. A\r\nmother has got to think ahead. Now listen. Would you trust me to watch\r\nthe baby while you curled up on the sofa and got a wink or two of\r\nsleep? I\'ll promise to call you should there be an atom of change. Do\r\nnow! Be a sensible woman. And how would you feel about my giving the\r\nlittle chap a drop of medicine? A Scotch doctor in the old country once\r\ngave me a prescription that I\'ve tried on both Timmie and Martin and it\r\ndid \'em worlds of good at a time just like this. It might do nothing\r\nfor your child, mind. I\'m not promising it would. Still, it couldn\'t\r\nhurt him and it might cure."\r\n\r\nJulie\'s dulled mind caught the final word. _Cure!_ Alas, she had given\r\nup hope that anything in the world could do that. The reaction that\r\ncame with the suggestion was so wonderful that it left her speechless.\r\n\r\n"Now see here," burst out Mrs. McGregor misinterpreting her silence,\r\n"use your common sense. Do I look as if I had come to poison your baby?\r\nWhy, woman, I love children better than anything on earth. They\'re a\r\nprecious lot of bother, there\'s no denying, and sometimes I get that\r\nimpatient with one or the other of \'em I could toss him out the window.\r\nBut for all their hectoring, and their noise, and their dirt--their\r\nmeddling, and smashing, and mending, I\'d not be without them."\r\n\r\nWhile speaking she had been touching the baby with a hand so yearning\r\nand tender that it could not be stayed. She had raised his head,\r\nsmoothed his pillow, straightened the coverings that lay over him. It\r\nwas amazing how quietly and deftly her hands moved. Even the child\r\nseemed conscious of her healing presence, for all of a sudden his wee\r\nfingers curled about one of hers and he smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n"See!" exclaimed Mrs. McGregor, "the baby is not afraid to trust me."\r\n\r\n"Nor am I any longer," put in Julie with eager surrender. "Do as you\r\nlike with Joey. You know better than I."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it isn\'t that," the visitor protested, rising. "It is just that\r\nit\'s sometimes well not to leave a stone unturned. You might regret not\r\nhaving taken the chance. I\'ll slip upstairs and get the medicine. It\r\nwon\'t take a minute."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll be that kind."\r\n\r\nThe Scotchwoman needed no second bidding. She was gone and back again\r\nin a twinkling, the magic green bottle in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Now if I might have a cup of hot water," said she. "I\'ve a dropper\r\nhere. We\'ll see what a spoonful of this mixture will do for the wee\r\nladdie. What is his name?"\r\n\r\n"Joey."\r\n\r\nMrs. O\'Dowd\'s eyes had brightened and they now beamed on her neighbor.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a nice name," replied Mrs. McGregor, beaming in turn. "I always\r\nliked the name of Joseph. Well, Joey boy, we\'ll see if we can make you\r\nwell. Here, little fellow!"\r\n\r\nGently she forced the liquid between the baby\'s lips.\r\n\r\n"Now we\'ll sponge him a bit, put on a fresh slip, and give him some\r\nair!"\r\n\r\n"But won\'t he----"\r\n\r\n"Catch cold? Not if he is shielded from the draught. He\'ll like the air\r\nand feel the better for it. It will help him to breathe."\r\n\r\nNoiselessly she went to work and within an hour both Joey and his\r\nsurroundings took on a different aspect.\r\n\r\n"Now," said she to the grateful mother, "you roll up in that comforter\r\nand take a nap. Don\'t worry about the baby. I\'ll be right here. Will\r\nyou trust me?"\r\n\r\nJulie hesitated.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not that I won\'t trust you," murmured she. "But you\'re so\r\nheavenly kind. Not another soul has done for me what you have and I\'m a\r\nhundred times better acquainted with \'em, too. Of course I know they\r\nhave all they can do without taking on the cares of others. I\'m not\r\nblaming them. You yourself can\'t have much time to spare. Haven\'t you\r\nother things to do?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I have," came with curt honesty from Mrs. McGregor. "I\'ve\r\nsix children and they leave me little time for idling. But when I do\r\ntake time away from \'em, I plan to take it to some purpose. Just now I\r\nhave nothing more important to do than nurse this baby. It\'s my first\r\njob. So don\'t be worrying about my work. Luckily it is Saturday and\r\nMary, Carl, and Timmie will look after the little tots and get the\r\ndinner. I told \'em to when I was there just now. Martin and Nell seldom\r\ngive any trouble, and should James Frederick wake up, one of the boys\r\nis to run down and tell me."\r\n\r\nJulie placed a hand impulsively on that of the other woman.\r\n\r\n"I can never thank you," murmured she brokenly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t be talking of thanks," Mrs. McGregor interrupted, cutting\r\nher short. "My dosing may do no good and before the day is out you may\r\nbe calling me a meddlesome old harridan. Wait and see what happens. I\'m\r\nnot one that sets much store by thanks, anyhow. After all, what does it\r\namount to but a string of words? If we can cure the baby it will be all\r\nthe thanks I want."\r\n\r\nIf the sentiment the final phrase so modestly expressed was genuine\r\nMrs. McGregor at least received the boon she craved, for as if by magic\r\nthe baby began to mend that very night and before the week passed was\r\nout of danger and on the high road to recovery. Julie\'s gratitude was\r\ntouching to see.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas Mrs. McGregor saved Joey," declared she to every person she met.\r\n"She\'s as good as any doctor--better, for Joey might have died but for\r\nher. Should I go through life kneeling to her on my bended knees I\r\nnever could thank her enough."\r\n\r\nJulie O\'Dowd did not go through life, however, kneeling before Mrs.\r\nMcGregor on her bended knees; but she did a more practical and\r\nefficacious thing. Everywhere she went she sounded the praise of her\r\nneighbor; talked of her kindness, her wisdom, her unselfishness, until\r\nnot only Mulberry Court, but the area adjoining it began to view the\r\ngaunt, austere figure from quite a different angle. Shyly the women\r\nbegan to nod a greeting to the stranger.\r\n\r\n"It\'s just her way to be curt and quick," explained they to one\r\nanother. "She doesn\'t mean a thing in the world by it. Julie says she\'s\r\nsharp and prickly as a chestnut burr, but with the sweetest of hearts\r\ninside."\r\n\r\nIndeed it was not long before Mrs. McGregor proved her right to this\r\ngenerous summary of her character. Other neighbors gained courage to\r\nconsult her about their children and in time about their troubles in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n"Ask Mrs. McGregor," became the slogan of Mulberry Court. "She\'ll\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nAnd she unfailingly did. She it was who prescribed medicines; gave\r\nadvice; suggested plain, common-sense remedies for every variety of\r\ndilemma. Nevertheless she wasted no words about it. She had no time to\r\nfool away, she let it be known. Whatever she did had to be done with\r\npitiless directness. Often her council was delivered through a crack in\r\nthe door or even given through the door itself; and there were\r\ninstances when it was shouted through the keyhole. But no matter where\r\nthe words came from they were always helpful and friendly and the\r\nneighbors came to understand the manner accompanying them and did not\r\nresent it.\r\n\r\nHer children understood it too. Mary, Carl, Timmie, Martin,\r\nfour-year-old Nell, and even wee James Frederick (whom Mrs. McGregor\r\nunfailingly addressed by his full name) all understood and worshipped\r\ntheir quick-tongued mother. Together with the rest of Mulberry Court\r\nthey also had supreme faith in whatever she did and said, and were\r\ncertain that every calamity under the sun could be set right if only\r\nshe were consulted and her advice followed.\r\n\r\nAnd yet loyal as they were, there was one point on which neither Carl\r\nnor Mary agreed with their mother. Of course she was right--she must be\r\nright; wasn\'t she always so? Yet notwithstanding this belief they could\r\nnot but feel that it would be a far better arrangement for them to\r\nleave school and go into the cotton mills where their father had worked\r\nfor so many years. Ever so many of the boys and girls they knew worked\r\nthere. Why should they remain in the High School struggling with\r\nalgebra, geometry, history, Latin, English and bookkeeping when they\r\nmight be earning money? It seemed senseless. Certainly the family\r\nneeded money badly enough. Were there not always endless pairs of shoes\r\nto be bought? Caps, mittens, suits, stockings, and underclothing to\r\npurchase; not to mention food and groceries? And then there was the\r\nrent.\r\n\r\nAh, Mary and Carl knew very well about the rent, the bills, and all the\r\nother worrisome things. Even Timmie, who was only nine, knew about\r\nthem; and once Martin, aged six, had startled his elders by proclaiming\r\non a sunny May morning, "This is rent day, isn\'t it, Ma?" in a tone of\r\nawe, as if the date marked some gruesome ceremony.\r\n\r\nYou came to understand about rent day when toward the end of the month\r\nthere were no pennies to be had, and you were forced to wait for the\r\nshoes or rubbers you needed.\r\n\r\nThat rent day was a milestone to be dreaded even Nell vaguely guessed\r\nand when it had passed in safety all the McGregors, both big and\r\nlittle, joined in a general rejoicing.\r\n\r\nMa was the magician who accomplished that happy miracle. Ma always\r\ncontrived to accomplish everything, so of course she managed rent day\r\nalong with the rest of the wonders she performed. She made no secret,\r\neither, of how she did it. She sewed! Yes, she sewed for a dressmaker\r\nwho sent her marvelous dresses to embroider. For Ma was very clever\r\nwith her needle and right out of the blue sky could make the most\r\nbeautiful flowers and figures with colored silks. She could also do\r\nbeading and she was teaching Mary how to do it. Already Mary could do\r\nquite nice embroidery and exquisite plain sewing.\r\n\r\nMa was very proud of this.\r\n\r\nBut what Mary did chiefly when she was not at school was to help with\r\nthe housework so her mother would be free to sew. That was the\r\nimportant thing. Ma must not roughen her hands or the silks she worked\r\nwith would be spoiled. So Mary cooked and scrubbed like a real little\r\nhousewife; took care of the younger children and kept them quiet so\r\nthey would not interrupt their mother.\r\n\r\nAnd between school hours Carl and Tim helped also. They built the\r\nfires, wiped the dishes, ran errands, and brought home any bits of\r\ndiscarded wood they found in the streets. In fact, there was not one\r\ndrone in the McGregor hive. Even James Frederick had learned to lie in\r\nhis crib and play by himself when everybody was busy.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy family, the McGregors. Its members, it is true, did not\r\nhave everything they wanted. They never expected that. Those who had\r\nmittens lacked new caps, and those who had caps were often forced to\r\nwear patched shoes and made-over stockings. Martin\'s reefer frequently\r\ndid duty for Nell, and Mrs. McGregor\'s cape for Mary. However, all that\r\ndid not matter. They were happy and that was the chief thing, happy in\r\nspite of patched clothing, coats that were outgrown, rubbers that were\r\neither sizes too small or dropped off at every step, and shoes that\r\nwere common property. The little flat was sometimes hot in summer and\r\ncold in winter but it took more than that to dampen the McGregors\'\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nWhen they had lentil soup, how steaming and delicious it was! When meat\r\nstew, what a dish for the gods! And who could have asked for a greater\r\ntreat than a thick slice of Mary\'s fresh bread coated over with\r\nmolasses or peanut butter?\r\n\r\nEvery month a long blue envelope containing a check from Uncle\r\nFrederick arrived and that, together with what Mary and her mother\r\nearned, kept the household going. But they seldom saw Uncle James\r\nFrederick Dillingham. He was always sailing to India, China, or South\r\nAmerica. Sometimes letters came from him and picture postcards showing\r\nstrange countries and people in foreign dress. But the check never\r\nfailed to make its appearance and as it was highly important that it\r\nshould, everybody agreed that since Uncle Frederick could not come\r\nhimself he was almost as satisfactorily represented by this magic bit\r\nof blue paper. The check brought things and perhaps if Uncle Frederick\r\nhimself had come he wouldn\'t. You could not tell about uncles you had\r\nnever seen.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the blue paper kept stew in the kettle and the shelter\r\nof Mulberry Court above their heads, and what better service could an\r\nuncle render his relatives?\r\n\r\nHence Uncle Frederick\'s name came to be mentioned constantly in the\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\n"Remember, Timmie, those are your Uncle Frederick Dillingham\'s rubber\r\nboots and be thankful to him for them," the boy\'s mother would observe\r\nwhen she brought home the purchase. Or "Uncle Frederick is presenting\r\nyou with those stockings, Carl. See you don\'t forget it."\r\n\r\nAnd the children did not forget. Gradually their unknown uncle came to\r\nassume in their imagination a form that would have surprised him had he\r\nbeen suddenly confronted by it. It was that of a benevolent-faced fairy\r\nclad in robes of purple and ermine, and wearing on his head a crown\r\nresplendent with gems of myriad colors. In his hand he carried a\r\nscepter terminating in a star that far outshone the jewels he wore, a\r\nscepter all powerful to work miracles. He was the good angel of the\r\nMcGregor home, the Aladdin to whom they owed all sorts of blessings.\r\n\r\nAnd yet withal Uncle James Frederick Dillingham was one and the same\r\nperson who sailed the _Charlotte_ to India, China, South America, or\r\nsome other ephemeral port. How paradoxical was this dual r\xc3\xb4le, how\r\nalluring and how ridiculous!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCARL TELLS A STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was April. Already spring was in the air. The grass in the parks was\r\nturning green, forsythia bloomed golden, and boys were playing marbles\r\non the streets and sidewalks. Even Mulberry Court, shut in as it was,\r\nfelt the impulse of the awakening season. The landlord came, looked\r\nover the premises, and after viewing the general shabbiness became\r\nreckless enough to order a broken windowpane to be reset, some of the\r\ntumble-down ceilings to be repaired, and the fire escapes and window\r\nframes to be repainted.\r\n\r\nPainting at Mulberry Court was a terrible ordeal. As there was not an\r\ninch of the place that was not crowded to the limit of its capacity,\r\npainting meant that milk bottles, improvised ice chests, and woodpiles\r\nmust be put somewhere else; and where that somewhere could be was an\r\nenigma. Furthermore, to add to this difficulty there were the\r\nchildren--dozens of them tumbling over one another and surging in and\r\nout the doors, a fact that rendered painting a precarious undertaking.\r\nYouthful investigators examined the moist pigment; chubby fingers drew\r\nhieroglyphics in it; while the less curious forgot it altogether and\r\ncarried away on their garments imprints of vermilion and black that\r\ntransformed their otherwise dingy garments into robes of oriental\r\nsplendor.\r\n\r\nCarl McGregor was no exception to the rule for wherever calamity lurked\r\nhe was sure to be in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n"I\'d know you\'d never rest until you got a patch of red paint on\r\nyourself," announced his mother, surveying him as he started toward the\r\ndoor. "As, if buying you sweaters ain\'t enough without your leaning\r\nplumb up against the fire escape and stamping a whole decalcomania of\r\nred stripes on your back like as if you were a convict."\r\n\r\n"Is there paint on me, Ma?"\r\n\r\n"Is there? I suppose you had no notion of it."\r\n\r\n"I hadn\'t--honest Injun."\r\n\r\n"Well, aside from the fact that you\'re barred up and down neat as if\r\nthe lines were ruled there\'s nothing the matter with you," returned his\r\nmother with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m awfully sorry, Ma. Truly I am."\r\n\r\n"Sorry? I\'ll be bound you are. You are always a bundle of regrets when\r\nit is too late to help anything. However, you need weep no tears for\r\nthat sweater needed washing anyway. You\'re that rough on your clothes\r\nthat none of \'em keep clean more than a minute. I\'ll get some gasoline\r\nand soak it out in the shed and it will be like new. Peel it off and\r\ngive it to me."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Ma," the boy repeated.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no great matter, sonny. Children must be children. I\'m past\r\nexpecting them to be grown-ups," his mother said kindly. "If you hadn\'t\r\nbeen getting into the paint you most likely would have been getting\r\ninto something else. You have a genius for such mishaps. I\'m glad it\r\nwas no worse."\r\n\r\nReassured, Carl grinned.\r\n\r\n"I do seem to have a good many--" he hesitated, then added,\r\n"misfortunes."\r\n\r\n"Misfortunes, do you call \'em? Sure that\'s a pretty polite word to\r\napply to the things that manage to happen to you," sniffed Mrs.\r\nMcGregor. "I suppose it was a misfortune when you tumbled underneath\r\nthe watering cart; and a misfortune when you sat down in the wet tar! A\r\nmisfortune when you sent the snowball through the schoolroom window; to\r\nsay nothing of the creamcake you treated Jakie Sullivan to that\r\nwell-nigh killed him."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know the creamcake was going to make him sick."\r\n\r\n"No; \'twas just your misfortune. You seem to attract adventures like\r\nthat. Why, if I was to let you go into the cotton mills as you are\r\nalways begging to do you\'d have every machine there out of order in\r\nless than a week and yourself hashed up into little pieces into the\r\nbargain."\r\n\r\nShe had touched upon an unlucky subject for instantly, with flaming\r\nface, the lad confronted her.\r\n\r\n"No, I wouldn\'t. I wish you would let me go into the mills, Ma. You\r\nmight let me try it. Ever so many boys no older than I are working\r\nthere and earning oodles of money. If we had more money we could----"\r\n\r\n"We could be having an automobile, no doubt, and going to Palm Beach\r\nwinters," was the grim response. "Well, Palm Beach or not, you\'re not\r\ngoing into any mill so long as we can keep body and soul together\r\nwithout your doing it. You are going to get an education--you and Mary\r\ntoo--if it costs me my life. I\'m not going to have you grow up knowing\r\nnothing and being nothing. Some day you\'ll see I was right and thank me\r\nfor it."\r\n\r\n"I thank you now, Ma," declared Carl soberly. "But that doesn\'t make me\r\nrelish Latin and history any better."\r\n\r\n"No matter if it doesn\'t. What you like is of no consequence," Mrs.\r\nMcGregor announced, with a majestic sweep of her hand. "The chief thing\r\nis that you exercise your mind and learn how to use it. The Latin\r\nitself amounts to nothing. It is like boxing gloves or a punching bag,\r\na thing that serves its turn to limber up your brain. It is learning to\r\nthink that counts."\r\n\r\nCarl\'s face brightened.\r\n\r\n"The teacher was saying something like that just the other day,"\r\nasserted he eagerly. "He was telling us about some of the people who\r\nhad done great things in the world and explaining how long and how hard\r\nthey had to work at them. The inventors, for instance, had to think and\r\nthink about the things they invented. It didn\'t just come to them all\r\nin a minute as I used to believe it did."\r\n\r\nAlthough his mother did not look up from her sewing she nodded\r\nencouragingly.\r\n\r\n"There was Eli Whitney," continued Carl, coming nearer. "I remembered\r\nabout him because of the mills here. He invented the cotton gin, you\r\nknow. Mr. Kimball told us that Whitney went through Yale and then\r\nstarted down South to be a tutor in somebody\'s family without any idea\r\nof ever being an inventor. But when he got to where he was going the\r\npeople who had hired him had changed their minds and found somebody\r\nelse and poor Eli Whitney was out of a job."\r\n\r\n"A shabby trick!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Still, it was lucky for him, just the same," responded Carl,\r\n"because on the way down he had met the widow of General Greene and she\r\nwas sorry for him and asked him to her house. He\'d just been vaccinated\r\nbecause there was lots of smallpox in the South and he was feeling\r\nrotten. You know how sore your arm gets and how sick you are sometimes.\r\nRemember Martin? Well, anyhow, Mrs. Greene either knew what it meant to\r\nbe vaccinated or else she was kind of ashamed of the way her part of\r\nthe country had treated Eli Whitney. Or maybe she was just kind-hearted\r\nlike you. Anyhow she invited Mr. Whitney to come to Savannah when she\r\nsaw how mean he felt and the fit he threw at finding himself so far\r\nfrom home without money or a job."\r\n\r\n"Carl!"\r\n\r\n"Well, wouldn\'t you have thrown a fit? I think Mrs. Greene was a\r\npeach," went on Carl, passing serenely over the reproof. "She was\r\nmighty kind to take a stranger into her house when he had no friends."\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"By this time Mr. Whitney had decided to be a lawyer and while he was\r\nmaking his home at Mrs. Greene\'s he began to read all the law books he\r\ncould lay hands on. Then one day Mrs. Greene busted her embroidery\r\nframe----"\r\n\r\n"Did _what_?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know, Ma," fretted Carl, at being interrupted. "She smashed\r\nthe thing and----"\r\n\r\n"What had that to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"Everything; because, you see, Eli Whitney mended it so nicely that\r\nMrs. Greene was pleased into the ground and thought he was the smartest\r\nperson ever. His father had had a shop at home where as a boy he had\r\nlearned to use tools. But of course Mrs. Greene didn\'t know that. All\r\nshe knew was that he made a corking job of her embroidery frame and so\r\none day when some Georgia gentlemen were there at dinner and were\r\ntelling how hard it was to get the seeds out of cotton she up and said,\r\n\'You should ask Mr. Whitney how to do it; he can do anything,\' and to\r\nprove it she toted out her embroidery frame to show them."\r\n\r\n"Did _what_?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, say, Ma, don\'t keep bothering me when I\'m trying to tell you a\r\nstory," Carl complained peevishly. "You know what I mean well enough."\r\n\r\n"Much as ever," was the grim reply.\r\n\r\nThe lad grinned.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyhow, the Georgia cotton men talked to Eli Whitney, explaining\r\nhow the cotton stuck to the seeds and got all broken to bits when you\r\ntried to get them out; and how it took nearly a whole day to separate a\r\npound of cotton fiber from the seeds. And then the cotton planters went\r\non to tell how there was lots and lots of land in the South where you\r\ncouldn\'t raise rice but could raise cotton if it wasn\'t such a chore--"\r\n(a warning glance from his mother caused Carl hastily to amend the\r\nphrase) "such a piece of work to get the seeds out. Eli Whitney\r\nlistened to their talk and after the men had gone he thought he\'d try\r\nto make some sort of a machine that would clear cotton of the seeds."\r\n\r\n"And did he?"\r\n\r\n"You betcha! I mean, yes, he did. Whitney was no boob." (This time Mrs.\r\nMcGregor failed to protest; perhaps she decided it was useless.) "He\r\nhad, as I told you, made wheels and canes and knives and nails in his\r\nfather\'s workshop at home. He had even made a violin. So he wasn\'t at\r\nall fussed about trying to make a cotton gin. I guess he had a hunch he\r\ncould do it."\r\n\r\n"A _what_?" gasped Mrs. McGregor involuntarily.\r\n\r\n"A hunch means he knew he could turn the trick."\r\n\r\nThe mother shook her head ruefully.\r\n\r\n"And me almost killing myself to give you an education!" she ejaculated\r\nbeneath her breath.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyway, Ma, slang or no slang, I\'d be telling you nothing at all\r\nabout Eli Whitney if I hadn\'t gone to school, so cheer up," asserted\r\nCarl impishly.\r\n\r\nHe heard his mother laugh. Mrs. McGregor had the good old Scotch sense\r\nof humor and when her flashing smile came it was always a delight to\r\nthe beholder.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a good boy, Carl, if you do speak the language of an orang-outang,"\r\nshe answered. "Where you pick up such a dialect I cannot imagine."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s easy enough to pick it up, Ma. The stunt is not to. Why, what\r\nI\'ve been saying just now is nothing to what I could say if I let\r\nmyself go. I\'ve been holding in because of you. I could have had you so\r\nlocoed you couldn\'t have understood a thing I meant if I hadn\'t\r\nbeen--been considerate. But I know you don\'t like slang so I try to cut\r\nit out. You may not believe it but I do try--honest, I do."\r\n\r\n"I believe you, laddie," returned his mother kindly. "It\'s hard, I\r\nknow, with all the other boys talking like barbarians. Now go on about\r\nMr. Whitney. Did he contrive to make the machine the Georgia gentlemen\r\nwanted?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, siree!" continued Carl with enthusiasm. "Mrs. Greene gave him a\r\nroom to work in down in the basement of her house and he set right\r\nabout the job. Unluckily he had never seen any cotton growing because\r\nhe had always lived in the North, you know. In fact, he had never laid\r\neyes on cotton at all until it was made into cloth, so of course he\r\nhadn\'t much of an idea what he was up against, and the first thing he\r\nhad to do was to scurry round and get specimens of cotton with the\r\nseeds in it. It wasn\'t so easy to do just then, either, because it was\r\nnot the season for cotton-gathering and he had to hunt and hunt to get\r\nsome of the last season\'s crop. I believe he finally got what he needed\r\nfrom a warehouse in New Orleans. Anyhow, he got the cotton pods\r\nsomewhere and found out better where he stood. And that reminds me, Ma,\r\nthat the teacher told us there were ever so many different kinds of\r\ncotton; and that the Upland cotton, growing in the South, had green\r\nseeds that stuck like--like _anything_ to the white part. You could\r\nhardly separate the two without ruining the cotton fibers and you can\r\nsee that as they were to be spun they must not be broken."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Whitney did have a puzzle to work out."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve said it, Ma! He sure had," beamed Carl. "Well, he kept fussing\r\nround, and fussing round, and by and by he managed to get together a\r\nsimple sort of contrivance that would do what he wanted it to. It was\r\nno great shakes of a machine. Any blacksmith or wheelwright could have\r\nmade it if he had happened to think of it first. In fact, lots of other\r\npeople did make gins like it. That is why Whitney never got rich, the\r\nteacher said."\r\n\r\n"But didn\'t he get his invention patented?" inquired Mrs. McGregor,\r\nlaying aside the tulle she was beading.\r\n\r\n"Not until it was too late. You see, Mrs. Greene was so set up to think\r\nMr. Whitney had done the deed she had predicted he would that she had\r\nto go blabbing all over town how clever he was. And the minute people\r\nheard that a cotton gin was really made that would take out the seeds\r\nthey came begging to see the wonderful machine and find out how it\r\nworked; and of course Mr. Whitney had to show it off. He hadn\'t a\r\nnotion people would be so low-down as to snitch his idea and go to\r\nmaking cotton gins of their own. But that\'s exactly what they did do\r\nand as soon as Mr. Whitney and Mr. Miller who was helping him got wise\r\nto the fact, they locked the new cotton gin up. But do you s\'pose that\r\ndid any good? Not on your life! The cotton raisers were crazy to get\r\nthe machine because everybody needed it so badly. On the plantations\r\nthere wasn\'t enough work to keep the negro slaves busy and it cost a\r\nlot to feed them. The planters figured that if something profitable\r\ncould be found for them to do they would earn their keep. They\r\ncertainly could not do this picking the seeds out of cotton because it\r\ntook them such an age to pick enough to make a pound. The darkies could\r\ngather the crop all right. It had to be gathered by hand. What was\r\nneeded was something that would take the seeds out and make it possible\r\nto raise and sell big quantities of cotton. So Whitney\'s gin exactly\r\nfilled the bill. It was just what the whole South had been waiting for\r\nand if such a thing existed people were bound to have it. Naturally\r\nwhen Whitney wouldn\'t show it to them and locked it up, they thought he\r\nwas almighty stingy and some of the meanest of the bunch broke into the\r\nplace where he kept it and carried it off."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"Rotten, wasn\'t it? They ought to have been hung; but they weren\'t.\r\nInstead, the model of the cotton gin got abroad and all the South\r\nstarted to making cotton gins until they were all over the place."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid Mr. Whitney wasn\'t a very business-like man," ventured Mrs.\r\nMcGregor.\r\n\r\n"He wasn\'t. Most generally inventors aren\'t, I guess. Still, how was he\r\nto know they were going to swipe his idea? Of course he and Mr. Miller\r\nwent straight to work and tried to pick up the pieces. Mr. Whitney went\r\nhome to New Haven and set about making cotton gins on a larger scale\r\nthan he could make them at Mrs. Greene\'s; but even then he could not\r\nmake them fast enough. And on top of all his factory burned down and\r\nfor a while he couldn\'t make any gins at all. It seemed as if hard luck\r\npursued him whichever way he turned."\r\n\r\n"It certainly did seem so!"\r\n\r\n"He and Mr. Miller, who had now gone in as his partner, spent no end of\r\nmoney in lawsuits, and Mr. Miller got so worn out and discouraged\r\nfighting the infringers that finally he died, leaving Eli Whitney to\r\ncarry on the battle alone. And it was a battle, too, to get any\r\nsatisfaction out of the people who were making use of his idea. I\r\nbelieve that North Carolina and Tennessee did pay him something, and\r\nafter a while South Carolina and Georgia did. In all he received about\r\nninety thousand dollars; but the lawsuits he had been compelled to go\r\nthrough to get it ate up a good slice of the receipts. Besides, some\r\nmore had to go for the factory that got burned and other expenses. So\r\nhe didn\'t get much out of the deal, I guess. But the South did. The\r\nWhitney gin whooped up their cotton trade in great style. Every year\r\nthe planters grew more and more cotton because now that they could get\r\nthe seeds out it paid to raise it, and by and by they were exporting\r\nmillions of bales. Cotton is now one of our biggest exports, the\r\nteacher said. We grow billions of pounds of it and for the most part it\r\nis the green seed, Upland cotton, cleaned by a gin founded on Whitney\'s\r\nidea. That\'s why I say it does you no good to go to school," concluded\r\nCarl. "Whitney went through Yale college and invented his cotton gin\r\nbefore he had been out of the university a year, and what good did it\r\ndo him, I\'d like to know?"\r\n\r\n"He did a lot to help the world along, sonny."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I suppose he did," admitted the boy. "But for all that he didn\'t\r\nget the spondulics. That is why I want to go into the factory. So I can\r\nget some cash to help out here at home. S\'pos\'n we didn\'t have Uncle\r\nFrederick Dillingham or your sewing money? And anyhow, I don\'t want you\r\nto be always sewing. I want you to have pretty clothes, ride round in\r\nan automobile, and be a lady!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Carlie! Can\'t one work for a living and still be a lady, my dear?"\r\n\r\nCarl flushed.\r\n\r\n"Of course she can, Ma. You\'re a lady right now. Still, I do wish you\r\ndidn\'t have to make those silly dresses all the time. Well, no matter.\r\nYou just wait until I get through school. You shall be wearing dresses\r\nlike those and somebody else shall be sewing the beads on."\r\n\r\nA suspicious moisture gathered in Mrs. McGregor\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a good boy, Carl," answered she gently, "even if you do\r\nslaughter your mother tongue. Now be off with you. All this palaver\r\nabout Mr. Whitney has almost made you late for school, and left me\r\nhardly knowing whether I am sewing frontwards or backwards. Still, it\r\nisn\'t a bad thing to have a son that knows something."\r\n\r\nIt was evident from Mrs. McGregor\'s tone that she might have said more\r\nbut for the stern belief that she must not flatter her children.\r\nTherefore to cut short the danger of such a crime she brusquely hurried\r\nCarl out of the kitchen, merely calling after him:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t forget to bring home a yeast cake to-night or you\'ll get no\r\nbread to-morrow. Put your mind on it, now. If you remembered the\r\nerrands I ask you to do half as well as you remember about cotton gins\r\nand the like you\'d save layers of shoe leather."\r\n\r\nIt was a characteristic farewell. Mrs. McGregor would not have been\r\nMrs. McGregor had she not uttered it. All this Carl understood and,\r\nundaunted by the words, he bent to kiss his mother on the cheek.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you wouldn\'t have time to stop into the Harlings on your\r\nway," suggested she, with a twinkle in her eye.\r\n\r\n"I was planning to stop there a minute as I went along."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be bound you were. One might as well try to keep a fly out of the\r\nmolasses as to keep you away from the Harlings. Well, since you are\r\ngoing that way anyhow, you can carry over a bowl of broth. I made it\r\nyesterday a-purpose. Tell Mrs. Harling it will only need to be heated\r\nup for herself and Grandfather Harling."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA TRAGEDY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the corner block beyond Mulberry Court that the Harlings\r\nlived, and had you asked Carl McGregor or his chum Jack Sullivan who\r\nHal Harling was you would have received in return for your ignorance a\r\nwithering stare, a sigh of pity, or possibly no reply at all. Any one\r\nwho did not know Hal Harling was either to be scorned or condoled with,\r\nas the case might be. Yet each boy would have found it difficult to put\r\ninto words who and what this distinguished personage really was.\r\n\r\nHal Harling was the embryo political boss of the district; the leader\r\nof the gang; the hero of every boy who lived within a radius of half a\r\nmile of the dingy flat on Broad Street. He was a tall, jovial-faced,\r\nthick-set fellow with the physique of a prize fighter and such an\r\nabundance of careless good humor that it bubbled contagiously from his\r\nround blue eyes and smiling lips. One would have said he was the last\r\nperson in the world to take offence and indeed on first glance one\r\nmight safely have made the assertion. But with this gay, happy-go-lucky\r\ndisposition went a highly developed desire for fair play which at times\r\nsuddenly converted the balmy, easy-going young autocrat into an enemy\r\npitiless and terrible.\r\n\r\nLet some brute stone a kitten; torment a boy smaller than himself;\r\nsnatch an apple from the stall of the old woman at the corner and, with\r\na justice whose speed was incredible, Hal Harding descended upon the\r\nmiscreant and pommeled into him a lesson in squareness that he did not\r\nsoon if forget.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the youthful avenger was usually on the right side\r\nincreased, if anything, the number of street brawls he was mixed up in,\r\nfor alas, Mulberry Court and all the outlying vicinity teemed with so\r\ngreat a multitude of injustices that he who set himself to straighten\r\nthem out found ample provocation for continual blows. As he trod the\r\nnarrow streets and alleys this champion of the weak encountered one\r\nchallenge after another with the result that it was a common sight in\r\nthe neighborhood to see Hal Harling the center of an angry scuffle.\r\n\r\nPartisanship was instant. A passer-by did not need to investigate the\r\nbroil. Ten cases out of eleven the victim of the squabble was getting\r\nwhat was coming to him, in popular opinion.\r\n\r\n"Hal Harling was giving it to him good and plenty," a sympathetic\r\nobserver would afterward relate. "I don\'t know what the fuss was about\r\nbut I didn\'t interfere for I\'ll wager Hal was right; he usually is."\r\n\r\nAround the standard of such a personality it was inevitable that the\r\ninhabitants of the community, especially the male ones, should rally;\r\nand foremost in the ranks of admiring worshippers were Jack Sullivan\r\nand Carl McGregor, either one of whom would willingly have rolled up\r\nhis own sleeves in defense of his idol. They tagged at his heels, ran\r\nhis errands, and walked on air whenever they won his commendation. If\r\nhe called them down it was as if they had been rolled in the dust.\r\n\r\nAnd yet despite the incense burned at his shrine Hal Harling kept a\r\nlevel head and an estimate of himself that was appealingly modest. In\r\nfact he was a very human boy with the same love of pranks and mischief\r\nthat delighted other boys. He loved a joke dearly. It was fun, for\r\nexample, to let an orange down on a string and dangle it before little\r\nKatie Callahan\'s window and then jerk it back out of Katie\'s reach when\r\nshe snatched for it. Or it amused him to drop peppermint balls through\r\nthe Murphy\'s letter box and hear the children inside the room chase\r\nthem as they rolled about the floor. Later he saw to it that Katie got\r\nthe orange and the Murphy youngsters the candy. All his jokes were like\r\nthat, their playful hectoring ending in kindness. He was too\r\nkind-hearted to enjoy causing pain.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder that such a hero had his satellites?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he had his enemies too--scores of them--for a\r\njustice dealer is never without opponents. As a rule these persons were\r\nthe victims of his various avalanches of wrath, those to whom at one\r\ntime or another he had meted out punishment and denounced as cowards.\r\nFor the disapproval of these cravens Hal Harling did not care a button.\r\nHe much preferred they should be numbered among his enemies rather than\r\nhis friends and he said so frankly. Nevertheless, his mother, timid by\r\nnature and of a peace-loving disposition, shook her head.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t afford, Hal, to antagonize folks the way you do," she would\r\nprotest. "The time may come when you\'ll be sorry."\r\n\r\nFor answer the giant would shrug his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid of anybody," he would reply proudly.\r\n\r\nThe statement was not made in a spirit of bravado; rather it reflected\r\nthe self-respect of one consciously in the right.\r\n\r\n"But you to be more careful. Such people are capable of working you\r\nharm."\r\n\r\n"Let them try."\r\n\r\n"But they are. They can do all sorts of underhanded things you would\r\nnot descend to," whimpered Mrs. Harling. "It worries me all the time to\r\nsee you so regardless."\r\n\r\n"There, there, Mother! Quit fussing about me," pleaded the big fellow\r\nkindly. "I\'m all right and can look after myself."\r\n\r\n"I know you can when the fight is a fair one," agreed his mother. "But\r\nyou never can tell what weapon a coward will use."\r\n\r\nHal laughed contemptuously and, realizing that her counsel had failed\r\nof its aim, Mrs. Harling said no more.\r\n\r\nUp to the present the calamities she periodically predicted had not\r\noccurred and as those who loved her son rallied round him with\r\never-increasing loyalty, and those who disliked him kept their\r\ndistance, she gradually ceased to protest. What was the use of wasting\r\nher strength on conditions she could not help? Poor soul! She needed\r\nevery atom of energy she possessed to meet the trials that beset her\r\nown path.\r\n\r\nFor Mrs. Harling was a helpless invalid and together with her bedridden\r\nfather lived day after day imprisoned in the small tenement overlooking\r\nthe rushing, hurrying world of which she was no part. Each morning\r\nLouise, Hal\'s younger sister, made tidy the house, packed up a\r\nluncheon, and the two started for Davis and Coulter\'s spinning mills\r\nwhere all day they helped to operate the busy machinery. It was a\r\nnoisy, monotonous occupation; a stretch of dull, wearisome hours, and\r\nfrequently the boy and girl were so tired at night they had scarcely\r\nenergy to move. And yet they toiled at the humdrum task gratefully,\r\nrejoicing in their wages which not only kept body and soul together but\r\nprovided for the feeble mother and the aged grandfather.\r\n\r\nThe past winter had been a hard one in Baileyville, the manufacturing\r\nvillage where they lived. Most of the mills were running on half time\r\nand many of the employ\xc3\xa9s had been turned away for lack of work. In\r\nconsequence worry and uncertainty hung over everybody. Who would be the\r\nnext to go, they speculated. One never could predict where the axe\r\nwould fall, or be sure he might not be the victim elected to meet its\r\nmerciless stroke.\r\n\r\nThus far both Hal and Louise had been retained at their posts; but the\r\nfear that some of the older operatives who had been longer in the\r\nemploy of the company might take precedence over them constantly\r\nmenaced their peace of mind.\r\n\r\nCorcoran, the foreman under whom they worked, was a harsh, unreasonable\r\nbully who rather enjoyed his post as executioner, authority having\r\nexaggerated in him all the meannesses that lurked in his small,\r\nvindictive nature. Only the week before, Hal, enraged by his\r\ndiscourtesy and injustice to one of the women, had blurted out to his\r\nface a rebuke for his roughness. It was, to be sure, an unwise act and\r\none that not only did the poor girl whose cause he championed little\r\ngood but jeopardized his own position; yet to save his soul he could\r\nnot have checked his indignation.\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t have said it," declared Louise, who had been an\r\neyewitness of the encounter. "Of course I was proud of you as could be;\r\nand you said nothing but what Corcoran deserved. Still it isn\'t safe to\r\ndo that sort of thing. It may lose you your job."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care if it does," returned Hal, whose rage had not yet cooled.\r\n"Corcoran may fire me if he wants to. But he isn\'t going to bully any\r\ngirl as he bullied Susie Mayo--not when I\'m round."\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you see, dear; we can\'t afford to lose our jobs," continued\r\nhis sister gently. "Too much depends on our keeping them. We must have\r\nthe money."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not worrying," laughed Hal with confidence. "If Corcoran should\r\ngive me the sack I could get another place without any trouble, I\'ll\r\nbet I could."\r\n\r\n"Places are not so easy to find," asserted the more prudent Louise.\r\n"There are lots of men in Baileyville who have been out of work for\r\nmonths. You ought not to be in such a hurry to rush into a quarrel,\r\nHal."\r\n\r\n"I was right; you say so yourself."\r\n\r\n"Yes, perhaps so. Still----"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think somebody ought to have called Corcoran down?"\r\n\r\n"Of course he was unfair and--and rude."\r\n\r\n"Rude!" interrupted her brother scornfully, "he was contemptible,\r\noutrageous!"\r\n\r\n"I know it. But----"\r\n\r\n"If fewer people stood for brutes there would be fewer brutes in the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t our business to round Corcoran up."\r\n\r\n"It is my business to stop any man who is impolite to a woman," replied\r\nHal. "Besides, Corcoran knew well enough he was wrong. You notice he\r\ndid not put up any defense. He just walked off and has never mentioned\r\nthe affair since."\r\n\r\n"That is what frightens me."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he isn\'t through."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! He\'s through all right. He hasn\'t uttered a yip and it is\r\nnow over two weeks ago that the thing happened. Quit your worrying,\r\nkiddie. There\'ll be no comeback from Corcoran."\r\n\r\nThe reassuring words, so confidently spoken, did much to allay Louise\'s\r\nfears. Uneventfully the days slipped by, and with every one that passed\r\nthe boy and girl breathed more freely. Not only were they skilled\r\nworkers but they were earnest and ambitious to give of their best.\r\nMoreover they had behind them an untarnished record for faithful\r\nattendance at the mills. Such service, argued they, must be of value,\r\nand when matched against much of the grudging, incompetent labor about\r\nthem should be of sufficient worth to keep them on Davis and Coulter\'s\r\npayroll. All they asked was fair play and to be judged on their merits.\r\nThis demand seemed reasonable enough; but alas, the world is not always\r\na just dealer and when on a Saturday morning not long before Christmas\r\nLouise Harling looked into her pay envelope a cry of dismay escaped\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe fate she had feared had overtaken her. Davis and Coulter informed\r\nher that after the fifteenth of the month, which fell a week hence, the\r\nfirm would not need her services.\r\n\r\nInstantly two thoughts rushed to her mind. One was whether Hal had also\r\nreceived similar notice; and the other was that all the holiday plans\r\nshe had so fondly cherished must now go by the boards. She would have\r\nno money to buy presents or a Christmas dinner. The holiday season was\r\na dreadful time of year to be without a penny. Try as she would to\r\nconceal her disappointment her lip trembled.\r\n\r\nWhen Hal met her that night and they started home she could hardly\r\nutter a syllable. It was not alone her own trouble that depressed her.\r\nShe longed and yet dreaded to hear what had befallen her brother. Were\r\na calamity like hers to come to him then indeed had misfortune\r\ndescended upon the Harling household. How would the invalid mother and\r\nthe feeble old grandfather get on without money? How would medicines be\r\nprocured? Or the rent be paid?\r\n\r\nHal, however, was to all appearances his serene self. He talked and\r\njested quite in his usual manner and if he were keeping something back\r\nhe certainly succeeded in doing so to perfection. Perhaps, argued she,\r\nhe had not been discharged at all. If not, why should this disgrace\r\nhave come to her? For in a measure it was a disgrace. When you lost\r\nyour job in the mill all Baileyville knew it and discussed the\r\ncircumstances, weighing the justice or injustice of the act. Certainly,\r\nthought Louise to herself, she had toiled as faithfully as she knew\r\nhow. Had there been fault with her work at least she was not conscious\r\nof it. It was mortifying, galling, to be turned away without a word of\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, Sis?" Hal questioned, at last noticing that his\r\nchatter failed to elicit its usual a gay response.\r\n\r\nLouise hesitated, shrinking from putting her tidings into words.\r\n\r\n"You look as if you\'d seen a ghost, old girl," smiled her brother\r\nfacetiously. "What\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been--they don\'t want----"\r\n\r\nHal halted, aghast.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say they\'ve asked you to quit?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s eyes blazed.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Corcoran, the cur! He\'s done it to get back at me for what I said\r\nto him."\r\n\r\n"You think so?"\r\n\r\n"Sure!"\r\n\r\n"But why choose me? I had nothing to do with the squabble."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just the point. He\'s smart enough to know it would hit me a\r\ndarn sight harder to have you lose your job than to lose my own,"\r\nblustered her brother wrathfully.\r\n\r\n"I wish I was sure it was only that."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because then I wouldn\'t care so much. I should know there was nothing\r\nthe matter with my work."\r\n\r\n"Of course there isn\'t. You\'re one of the best operators they\'ve got in\r\nthe mill. Hines, one of the bosses, told me so only the other day."\r\n\r\n"Really?" The girl\'s face brightened. "Why didn\'t you tell me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. Forgot it, I guess," smiled Hal. It was not his way\r\nto pass on compliments. Had the criticism been adverse he would have\r\ntold it quickly enough.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m awfully glad he said so."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was very decent of him. Everybody knows though that you\'re a\r\nfine worker--even old Corcoran himself, I\'ll be bound, although he\r\nwouldn\'t admit it. You\'re quick, careful, prompt and never absent. What\r\nelse do they want? Oh, Corcoran was behind this, all right. It wasn\'t\r\nyour work sacked you. It was plain spite."\r\n\r\n"I\'m thankful for that!" sighed Louise.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not. It makes me hot," burst out Hal.\r\n\r\n"Still, it is better than losing your place because your work was so\r\npoor you couldn\'t hold the job," smiled the girl.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see it that way. This is just low down and unfair."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t mind that. I know I wasn\'t to blame."\r\n\r\n"You bet you weren\'t. I wish I had Corcoran here. I\'d shake the\r\ndaylights out of him."\r\n\r\n"Whose daylights are going to be shaken out now?" inquired a laughing\r\nvoice, and the brother and sister turned to see Carl McGregor beside\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Old Corcoran up at the works," snarled Hal. "He\'s given Louise the\r\nsack!"\r\n\r\nCarl did not speak. He knew only too well how genuine was this\r\ndisaster. In the sympathetic silence that followed the three young\r\npersons seemed to draw closer together.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t as if Loulie had done anything to deserve such a slam," Hal\r\nsuddenly declared. "He\'s just taking out his spite on me and he\'s\r\nchosen this means of doing it. To light on a woman! I\'d a hundred times\r\nrather he\'d shipped me. But it\'s like him."\r\n\r\nMoodily the three walked on.\r\n\r\n"Of course, I must get some other place right away," Louise said\r\npresently, as if thinking aloud. "I don\'t know just what. I\'ve never\r\nworked anywhere but in the mills and I have no other trade. To be\r\nturned away from Davis and Coulter won\'t be much of a recommendation\r\nfor me either, I\'m afraid."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you can get a hundred jobs," announced Hal, with a confidence he\r\ndid not feel. "Don\'t you fret."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know." His sister shook her head. "Scores of Baileyville girls\r\nare idle."\r\n\r\nThe statement met with no denial. Who could combat it? It was only too\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n"Not girls like you," Carl ventured, determined to be optimistic.\r\n\r\n"Girls exactly like me, Carlie," smiled Louise.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you won\'t be idle," murmured Hal.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t be--I simply can\'t. We\'ve got to have money."\r\n\r\nOnce again her companions found themselves unable to refute the\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\nThey had turned into the main thoroughfare of the town and were\r\nthreading their way along a sidewalk teeming with the throng of\r\nSaturday shoppers that is such a characteristic part of the life of a\r\nmill town. The street beside them was black with trucks, motor cars,\r\nand the congested traffic of a manufacturing center.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a cry from Carl.\r\n\r\n"Jove!" exclaimed he. "Look at that kid!"\r\n\r\nIn his horror he put out his hand to clutch his friend\'s arm. But his\r\nfingers closed on empty air.\r\n\r\nHal Harling was gone!\r\n\r\nWhat followed happened so quickly that it was more like the shiftings\r\nof a moving picture than an incident in real life.\r\n\r\nHal bounded into the seething maelstrom of the street, caught up a\r\nlittle boy midway in the stream of rushing vehicles and held him aloft\r\nin safety.\r\n\r\nThe baby had obviously been pursuing a small black puppy whose dangling\r\nleash told a story of escape from captivity. Making the most of his\r\nfreedom the dog had run recklessly along and the child had dashed after\r\nhim, too intent on recapturing his pet to heed whither the chase took\r\nhim. It was little short of a miracle that he had not been killed and\r\nfor his rescue from such a fate he had the quick wit of Hal Harling to\r\nthank.\r\n\r\nA second later all passing on the street had stopped and crowds of\r\nspectators surged around the young hero. Above the tense stillness\r\ncould be heard Hal\'s comforting voice:\r\n\r\n"Sure we\'ll find your dog for you, little chap. Don\'t cry. You say he\'s\r\ncalled Midget. That\'s a fine name for a dog, isn\'t it? See! Somebody\r\nover there on the sidewalk has him already. We\'ll go and get him."\r\n\r\nAs the two chubby arms closed about Hal\'s neck into the center of the\r\ncrowd catapulted a frenzied nursemaid who madly rushed up to young\r\nHarling.\r\n\r\n"He\'s not hurt a mite," Hal announced, reassuringly. "I guess he ran\r\naway from you, didn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"He was leading the dog and the leash slipped out of his hands," gasped\r\nthe affrighted girl. "Before I\'d a notion what he was going to do he\r\nwas off after the puppy. I\'m weak as a rag. If anything had happened to\r\nhim----"\r\n\r\n"But it didn\'t," smiled Hal.\r\n\r\n"No, thanks to you, and to the good Lord!"\r\n\r\nThen, seizing the child in her arms, she said:\r\n\r\n"There, Billie, you see what comes of running out of the yard after\r\nMidget. You might have been killed but for this kind gentleman."\r\n\r\n"Indeed he might! He would have been. I saw the whole thing myself,"\r\nbroke in a policeman who had joined the group.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad he\'s all right," reiterated Hal, as he gave the child into\r\nthe maid\'s care.\r\n\r\nA man approached leading Midget and interest being for the moment\r\ndiverted from himself Hal made his escape.\r\n\r\nIn a doorway he spied Louise and Carl.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it was wonderful of you, Hal!" his sister murmured.\r\n\r\n"It was just lucky," Hal returned a bit gruffly. "Come on! Let\'s get\r\nout of this push. We\'ll be late for supper if we don\'t hike along."\r\n\r\nAnd it was characteristic of Hal Harling that this was the only\r\nallusion he made to the adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough temporarily buoyed up by the episode of the afternoon Carl\r\nMcGregor returned home with spirits at a lower ebb than they had been\r\nfor many a day. To be out of work was a very real tragedy in the world\r\nin which he lived. He knew only too well how indispensable was money\r\nand that the necessity of it was even greater in the Harling home than\r\nin his own. The Harlings, alas, had no absent Uncle Frederick to fall\r\nback upon. On the contrary the entire upkeep of their home and family\r\nfell upon the young shoulders of the boy and girl who toiled at the\r\nspinning mills. Now with Louise out of the race Hal would be left alone\r\nwith all the burden, and whether he would be able to carry so heavy a\r\none was a question. Undoubtedly he would not be forced to bear it for\r\nlong. Louise would find employment--she must find it. Did not the need\r\ncompel it? And was she not far too capable a worker to be out of a\r\nplace? Why, scores of people would seek her help eagerly when once it\r\nwas known her assistance was available.\r\n\r\nSound as these arguments were, however, facts did not bear them out.\r\nApparently nobody in Baileyville wished help, no matter how excellent\r\nits quality. Every night the report from the Harlings was the\r\nsame--Louise could find nothing to do. Even Mrs. McGregor who was\r\nordinarily able to straighten out every sort of tangle had no remedy\r\nfor the present pitiable dilemma. The only employment it was in her\r\npower to secure for the girl was fine sewing and Louise, restricted by\r\nher factory training, could not sew. A week went by and still nothing\r\npresented itself. Mrs. Harling and the aged grandfather, from whom the\r\ncalamity had been kept as long as it was possible to conceal it, at\r\nlength took up the worry.\r\n\r\n"Whatever is going to become of us now?" bewailed each in turn.\r\n"Where\'s the food and rent coming from?"\r\n\r\nHal fidgeted.\r\n\r\nEvery day he looked more harrowed and distressed, and the smile that\r\nhad formerly come so spontaneously came now with an effort. He had\r\ntaken on an extra job evenings, that of delivery boy for the local\r\ngrocer. It did not bring in much, to be sure, and it kept him on his\r\nfeet at the end of the day when often he was too tired to stand.\r\nHowever, all these disadvantages were lost sight of in the few\r\nadditional dollars derived from the makeshift.\r\n\r\n"Mother says you can\'t keep this up, old chap," remarked Carl dismally.\r\n"She says you will be getting tired out and sick and then where will\r\nyou be?"\r\n\r\n"But we\'ve got to have the cash, kid! _Got to have it_, don\'t you see?\r\nIt was I who landed us in this plight and I\'m the one to get us out.\r\nIt\'s nobody\'s fault but mine."\r\n\r\nCarl sighed.\r\n\r\n"I suppose Corcoran wouldn\'t----"\r\n\r\n"Take Louise back if I were to humble myself," flared Hal. "Do you\r\nthink for a moment I\'d ask him? Do you imagine I\'d gratify him by\r\nletting him know how hard he\'d hit us? Not on your life! For all he\r\nknows the Harlings are rich as mud and don\'t care a hurrah for his old\r\njob. I want him to think that too. If he pictures me eating out of his\r\nhand he\'s mistaken."\r\n\r\nCarl looked grave.\r\n\r\n"It is all very well to be proud," affirmed he, smiling at his friend\'s\r\ncharacteristic attitude of mind. "But sometimes you can\'t afford to be\r\ntoo cocky. If, as you say, you pitched into Corcoran and were wrong----"\r\n\r\n"But I wasn\'t wrong," broke in Hal. "I meant every word I said; it was\r\nthe truth and I\'d say it again if I got the chance. You\'d have said the\r\nsame yourself if you\'d been there. The thing that got his goat was that\r\nit was true."\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t go round telling people the truth about themselves, old\r\nman," observed Carl with a wisdom far beyond his years. "They won\'t\r\nstand for it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet I would. I\'d a darn sight rather a person told me straight to\r\nmy face what he thought of me than whispered it behind my back."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I\'m trying to do now," grinned Carl.\r\n\r\nYoung Harling\'s lips curved into a smile.\r\n\r\n"Why, so you are, kid," returned he. "I didn\'t recognize the stunt at\r\nfirst. You\'re a mighty white little chap, Carl. Maybe I was wrong to\r\nlight into Corcoran as I did. Of course he is my superior and I really\r\nhad no business to sarse him, even if he was wrong. But he is such a\r\ncad! It made my blood boil to hear him berate that poor little Mayo\r\ngirl--and for something she did not do, too."\r\n\r\n"I know."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you were in this mess what would you do? Come now. Give me\r\nsome of your sage advice."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t suppose you ought to go to----"\r\n\r\n"Corcoran and apologize?" interrupted Hal hotly. "No, I don\'t. I\'d\r\nstarve before I\'d do that."\r\n\r\n"But how about your grandfather, your mother, and Louise?"\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t let them starve, if that\'s what you mean. You can bet your\r\nlife on that," cried Hal. "If anybody goes without it will be myself."\r\n\r\n"You seem to be doing it all right."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you suppose I\'ve eyes in my head? You\'re thin as a rail\r\nalready."\r\n\r\n"Huh! That\'s only because I\'ve been chasing round with bundles. I was\r\ntoo fat, anyway; didn\'t get enough exercise at the mills."\r\n\r\n"Hal Harling!"\r\n\r\n"Straight goods, I didn\'t. Just stood and fed stuff into that loom from\r\nmorning till night. You don\'t call that exercise, do you?"\r\n\r\n"I noticed that by night you were often all in, exercise or no\r\nexercise," was the dry response. "Well, you\'ve got to go your own gait,\r\nI guess."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet a hat _you_ wouldn\'t go and bow down to Corcoran."\r\n\r\nThe thrust told.\r\n\r\n"Bow down to him? I\'d crack his nut!"\r\n\r\nHal chuckled with satisfaction at his chum\'s loyalty.\r\n\r\n"There you are, you see!" declared he. "You are every whit as rabid as\r\nI am when it comes to the scratch."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'m more rabid when things hit you and Louise," murmured\r\nCarl.\r\n\r\nThe two walked on without speaking, the mind of each busy with the\r\nproblem in hand.\r\n\r\nCarl\'s imagination circled every mad avenue of escape from the\r\nHarlings\' financial crisis. If only he were rich! If only somebody\r\nwould suddenly leave him some money! If only--his brain halted in the\r\nmidst of its absurd gyrations.\r\n\r\nIf he were not rich; if he had no fairy fortune to pass over to Hal and\r\nLouise, what was to hinder him from performing for them a far more\r\ngenuine service of friendship and affection? Instead of offering them\r\nmoney that was dropped into his hand why should he not test out his\r\nreal regard for them by earning it? Many a boy his age, aye, younger\r\nthan he, earned money. Why should he be free of responsibility when\r\nHal, who was only a few years older, was weighed down with it?\r\n\r\nJust why it had never occurred to him that if he earned money he might\r\nwith propriety hand it over to his own hard-working mother is a\r\nquestion. Often with eyes fixed on the clouds we lose sight of the\r\nthings just beneath our noses. Perhaps that was the explanation of\r\nCarl\'s lack of thought. Be that as it may, certain it was that he\r\nparted from his chum afire with the generous impulse of making a\r\npersonal effort to reinforce the Harlings\' slender income.\r\n\r\nHe was only a stone\'s throw from home and what led him to turn the\r\nother way, pass into Beaver Street, and go south toward Orient Avenue\r\nhe could not have told. Possibly he was still thrilling with newly\r\nawakened altruism and was not yet ready to have his roseate dreams\r\ndisturbed. Or he may have been pondering so deeply how to put his\r\nimpulses into action that he failed to heed just where he was going. At\r\nany rate before he realized it there he was in the fashionable section\r\nof the village, walking along between rows of bare and stately elms and\r\ngreat rambling houses glimpsed from behind high brick walls.\r\n\r\nHe had not been in this part of Baileyville for months. There was\r\nnothing to take him there. What connection had his life with those\r\nfortunate lives that made leisure and luxury things to be taken for\r\ngranted? Even now he started at finding himself in a location so\r\nincongruous; or rather at finding so incongruous a person as himself in\r\nan environment so out of harmony with his thought and station.\r\n\r\nHe whirled about to start homeward and it was just at this instant that\r\na trim racing car drew up beside him and a man\'s voice inquired\r\npleasantly:\r\n\r\n"Lost your way, youngster?"\r\n\r\nCarl glanced at the speaker.\r\n\r\nHe was a gray-haired, clean-shaven man, with fresh color and keen blue\r\neyes. Although muffled to the chin in a raccoon coat that almost met\r\nthe fur of his cap there was a splendid vigor about him that breathed\r\nhealth, energy, and the rewards a temperate life brings. Everything\r\nabout him seemed clearness personified--eye, complexion, voice.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not lost my way, thank you, sir," Carl answered. "I just got to\r\nthinking and have wandered farther from home than I meant to."\r\n\r\n"Are you going back to town now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Jump in and I\'ll give you a lift."\r\n\r\nRaising the fur robes invitingly the stranger reached to open the door.\r\n\r\nCarl was almost too surprised to speak.\r\n\r\n"You\'re very kind, sir," he contrived to stammer. "I should be glad of\r\na ride. I don\'t often get one. Besides, I ought to have been at home\r\nlong ago."\r\n\r\nThe honesty of the reply apparently pleased the motorist for, smiling,\r\nhe tucked the lad in and asked:\r\n\r\n"Where do you live?"\r\n\r\n"At Mulberry Court, sir."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I don\'t quite know where that is."\r\n\r\n"Very likely not. It\'s a little tenement house off Minton Street. Maybe\r\nyou never were there."\r\n\r\n"I guess I never was," the man replied simply.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a nice place to live," continued Carl, glowing with local pride.\r\n"Of course it isn\'t like this. We\'ve no trees. But in winter trees\r\naren\'t much good anyway; and in summer we can go to the parks."\r\n\r\nTo this philosophic observation his companion agreed with a nod and\r\nthey sped on in silence.\r\n\r\nThe vast stretches of snow, so unsightly in the city\'s narrow\r\nthoroughfares, were on every hand white and sparkling, and each little\r\nshrub rearing its head out of the spangled fields was laden with\r\nermine.\r\n\r\nThe boy drew a long breath, drinking in the crystal air.\r\n\r\n"Gee!" he burst out impulsively. "This is great. I feel cheered up\r\nalready."\r\n\r\nThe man driving the car shot him a quiet smile.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to hear that," said he. "So you were out of spirits, were\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I was fussed within an inch of my life," owned Carl with engaging\r\ncandor.\r\n\r\n"In wrong somewhere?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m not; but my chum is."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you see his sister has just been fired from Davis and Coulter\'s\r\nmills. It wasn\'t her fault at all, either. Her brother gave the\r\nforeman, Corcoran, a jawing because he got too fresh with one of the\r\ngirls. Corcoran didn\'t say a word at the time but a couple of weeks\r\nlater he took out his spite on Hal Harling\'s sister, Louise. I suppose\r\nhe was mad and decided on this way to get even."\r\n\r\n"Humph!"\r\n\r\n"Maybe he thought he\'d take Hal\'s pride down and make him come crawling\r\nto him on his knees to get Louise back into the mills. It is a rotten\r\ntime to be out of work. Louise has tried and tried to get another job\r\nand can\'t land a thing. But whether she does or not, her brother isn\'t\r\ngoing crawling to Corcoran. He\'s not afraid of the old tyrant. Hal\r\nHarling isn\'t afraid of anything. Why, only the other day he tore into\r\nthe street and saved a little runaway chap from being mashed to jelly\r\nunder a lot of automobiles. The baby was chasing a dog and got into the\r\nmiddle of High Street before he realized it. He would certainly have\r\nbeen killed had it not been for Hal."\r\n\r\n"Whose baby was it?" questioned the man beside him in an odd voice.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. We didn\'t wait to see. Hal was anxious to get out of\r\nthe crowd and we were late home anyway. So Harling gave the kid to the\r\nnursemaid and lit out."\r\n\r\nThere was a muffled: "I see!" from his listener.\r\n\r\n"And where do you come in in all this tangle?" queried the stranger\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n"I? Why, you see Hal Harling is my----" a sudden reserve fell upon the\r\nlad. It was impossible to explain to anybody just what Hal Harling was\r\nto him. "I chase round with the Harlings a lot," explained he. "They\r\nare almost like my own family."\r\n\r\n"Oh, so that\'s it!"\r\n\r\n"I\'d decided just now to hunt for a job and see if I couldn\'t make good\r\nthe money Louise is missing. She can\'t seem to find a darn thing to do,\r\npoor kid. She\'s been out of work over a week now and they\'ve got to\r\nhave money or Mrs. Harling and Grandfather Harling will starve to\r\ndeath. Of course I\'m not so much," continued Carl modestly. "But I\'m\r\nwilling to work and I\'m sure I could earn something."\r\n\r\nThe owner of the velvet-wheeled car did not speak at once. Then he\r\nremarked abruptly:\r\n\r\n"You don\'t go to school to-morrow, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Saturday? Not on your--no, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'d be free to come to my office to-morrow morning and see me,\r\nwouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Do you think you could give me a job? Sure I\'d come!" ejaculated Carl\r\nwith zest.\r\n\r\n"Good! Come to the Berwick building, Number 197 Dalby Street, to-morrow\r\nat ten o\'clock. Give your name and--by the by, what is your name?"\r\n\r\n"Carl McGregor, sir."\r\n\r\n"A fine old Scotch name. Well, you write it on a card or a piece of\r\npaper and give it to the man you will find at the door. Maybe I shall\r\nbe able to do something for you."\r\n\r\nThe car rolled up to the curb and stopped.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been mighty kind, sir," said Carl, as he leaped out. "You\'ve\r\nbrought me nearly home."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I was going this way anyway," smiled the man in the fur coat. "You\r\nwon\'t have far to walk now, will you?"\r\n\r\n"Only a block. I\'ll be home in a jiffy."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t forget about to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"_Forget!_"\r\n\r\nLaughing at something that evidently amused him very much the stranger\r\nstarted his engine.\r\n\r\nAs for Carl, he raced home as fast as ever his feet would go. Already\r\nhe was late for supper, a fact always annoying to his mother, who\r\nconsidered tardiness one of the most flagrant of sins. To be sure he\r\nwas not often late, for miss what other functions he might he seldom\r\nmissed his meals. To-night, however, the table had been cleared, the\r\ndishes washed, and only a saucepan of corn-meal mush, steaming on the\r\nback of the stove, remained as a souvenir of the feast.\r\n\r\n"For goodness\' sake, Carl, wherever have you been?" asked Mrs.\r\nMcGregor, as he entered, panting from his run up the long flights of\r\nstairs. "I\'ve been worried to death about you. Go wash your hands and\r\ncome and eat your supper right away. You know I don\'t like you out\r\nafter dark."\r\n\r\n"I know it, Ma," the boy responded penitently. "I\'m mighty sorry. I\'d\r\nno idea, though, that it was so late."\r\n\r\n"Where\'ve you been?"\r\n\r\n"To walk."\r\n\r\n"To walk? Just to walk? Mercy on us! Not just walking round for\r\nnothing!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid so, yes."\r\n\r\n"Who was with you?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody."\r\n\r\nFor an instant Mrs. McGregor looked searchingly at her son.\r\n\r\n"Well, did you ever hear the like of that!" commented she, addressing\r\nthe younger children who clustered about their brother with curiosity.\r\n"What set you to go walking?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Ma. Just a freak, I guess."\r\n\r\n"A foolish freak--worrying the whole family, delaying supper, and what\r\nnot. Now come and eat your porridge without more delay. Mary, go bring\r\nthe milk; and, Timmie, you fetch a clean saucer from the pantry.\r\nMartin, stop pestering your brother until he eats something; he\'ll play\r\nwith you and Nell by and by. Such a noisy lot of bairns as you are! If\r\nyou\'re not careful you\'ll wake James Frederick."\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of her grumbling, the mother regarded her brood\r\nof clamoring youngsters with affectionate pride. They were indeed a\r\nhusky group, red-cheeked, high-spirited, and happy; their chatter, as\r\nshe well knew, was nothing more than the normal exuberance of\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\nWhile Carl hungrily devoured his big bowlful of cereal his mother\r\ncontinued her sewing. She was working on a film of blue material\r\na-glitter with silver beads that twinkled from its folds like stars.\r\nEvery now and then little Nell, fascinated by the sparkle of the\r\nfabric, would start toward the corner where her mother sat in the ring\r\nof brilliant lamplight.\r\n\r\nInstantly one of the older brothers or sisters would intercept the\r\nchild, catching up the wriggling mite and explaining softly:\r\n\r\n"No, dearie, no! Nell must not trouble mother. Mother\'s working."\r\n\r\nIt was an old, oft-repeated formula which every one of the little group\r\nhad heard from the time he had been able to toddle. Familiar, too, was\r\nthe picture of their mother seated in the circle of light, her basket\r\nof gayly hued spools beside her, and a cloud of shimmering splendor\r\nwreathing her feet. Sometimes this glory was pink; sometimes it was\r\nblue, lavender, or yellow; not infrequently it was black or a smoky\r\nmist of gray. The children always delighted in the brighter colors,\r\ncrowding round with eagerness whenever a new gown was brought home to\r\nsee what hue the exciting parcel might contain.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing but a sleepy old gray one this time!" Timmie would bewail.\r\n"And gray beads, too! Do hurry up, Ma, and get it done so we can have\r\nsomething else."\r\n\r\nBut let the paper disclose a brilliant blue or a red tulle and\r\ninstantly every child clapped his hands.\r\n\r\nExultantly they examined the scintillating jet or iridescent sequins.\r\n\r\n"Oh, this is the best yet, Ma!" Carl would cry. "It\'s a peach of a\r\ndress."\r\n\r\nTheir ingenious admiration did much to transform their mother\'s tedious\r\ntask into a fine art and helped her to regard it with dignity.\r\nCertainly its influence on the characters of her children was\r\ninestimable. Not alone did it answer their craving for beauty, but far\r\nbetter than this \xc3\xa6sthetic gratification was the education it gave them\r\nin thoughtfulness and unselfishness. Consideration for their mother,\r\nrestraint, independence, all emerged out of the yards of foolish gauze\r\nand the frivolous spangles.\r\n\r\nTherefore Mrs. McGregor sewed on serene in spirit and if, as to-night,\r\nher task barred her from secrets her children might amid greater\r\nleisure have bestowed on her, the circumstance was accepted as one of\r\nthe unavoidable disadvantages attending constant occupation.\r\n\r\nIt was regrettable she had not more time to talk with her sons and\r\ndaughters separately. Confidences were shy and volatile things that\r\ncould not be delivered in a hurry or hastily fitted into the chinks of\r\na busy day. Confidences depended on mood and could not be regulated so\r\nthat they would be forthcoming in the few seconds snatched between one\r\nduty and another.\r\n\r\nAs a result it came about that after Carl had swallowed his supper,\r\nfrolicked with the younger children and helped Mary put them to bed,\r\nbrought in the kindlings and coal for the morning fire, it was time for\r\nhim to tumble in between the sheets himself, and he did so without\r\nmentioning to his mother or any one else his adventures of the\r\nafternoon or his morrow\'s appointment with the stranger.\r\n\r\nOne does not always wish to relate his affairs before five small\r\nbrothers and sisters whose little ears drink in the story and whose\r\ntiny tongues are liable artlessly to repeat it.\r\n\r\nIn the McGregor household there was affection and happiness; but, alas,\r\nthere was no such thing as privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA TANGLE OF SURPRISES\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning, to which Carl had looked forward for a moment with his mother,\r\nbrought, alas, even more meager opportunity for imparting secrets than\r\nhad the night before, for as was the custom of the McGregor family the\r\nnew day was launched amid a turmoil of confusion. Hence it came about\r\nthat although Carl made several valiant attempts to waylay his mother\r\nin the pantry, or corral her in her room, he was each time thwarted and\r\nwas never able to get beyond a vague introduction to the topic so near\r\nhis heart. At length a multitudinous list of errands to the butcher,\r\ngrocer, and baker was handed him and there was no alternative but catch\r\nup his hat and coat and speed forth upon these commissions. And no\r\nsooner were they all fulfilled than the hour for his appointment with\r\nthe stranger arrived and, palpitating with the interest of his mission,\r\nhe set forth to the address to which he had been directed.\r\n\r\nIt was in the down-town part of the village and so busy was he dodging\r\ntrucks and hurrying pedestrians that he paid scant heed to anything but\r\nthe gilt numbers that dotted the street. In and out the crowd he wove\r\nhis way until above a doorway the magic characters he sought stared at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere may have been, and probably were, signs announcing the nature of\r\nthe business in which this mysterious friend was engaged but if so Carl\r\nwas blind to them. All that concerned him was to find the place that\r\nsheltered his remarkable acquaintance and ascertain the sequel of the\r\nday before.\r\n\r\nTherefore he walked timidly into the hallway and seeing at the other\r\nend of it an oaken door panelled with ground glass that bore the\r\nhieroglyphics of his quest he turned the heavy brass knob and walked\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThe room was spacious and its rich furnishings and atmosphere of\r\nstillness were in such marked contrast to the hubbub of the street that\r\nhe paused on the heavy rug, abashed. There was, however, no time for\r\nretreat even had his courage failed him for the door behind him had no\r\nsooner clicked together than a boy in a gray uniform came forward. As\r\nhe approached his eye swept with disapproval the shabby visitor and he\r\nsaid, with an edge of sharpness crisping his tone:\r\n\r\n"What can I do for you?"\r\n\r\n"I want to see a--a--gentleman," stammered Carl. "I don\'t know his\r\nname. I forgot to ask it. But he told me to come to this number to-day\r\nat ten o\'clock and give him my name on a piece of paper. I\'ve got it\r\nhere somewheres."\r\n\r\nAwkwardly he searched his pockets, the waiting messenger watching his\r\nevery movement.\r\n\r\nIt was a grimy morsel of parchment that was at length produced; but the\r\ninstant the supercilious page read the name scrawled upon it his\r\nattitude changed from superiority to servility.\r\n\r\n"This way, sir, if you please," said he, wheeling about.\r\n\r\nCarl followed his guide, feeling, as he tagged across the silencing\r\nrug, deplorably small, and painfully conscious of both his hands and\r\nfeet. He and his conductor passed through another door, threaded\r\nlabyrinthian aisles flanked by gaping clerks and faintly smiling\r\nstenographers, and came at length to a third door which the youth\r\npreceding him opened with a flourish.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Carl McGregor," announced he in a stentorian tone.\r\n\r\nAll the blood in Carl\'s body rushed to his face.\r\n\r\nThe room before him was small and on its warmly tinted walls a few\r\npictures, some of which his school training led him to recognize as\r\nRembrandt reproductions, lent charm and interest to the interior. But\r\nthese details were of minor importance compared to the thrill he\r\nexperienced at discovering behind a great mahogany desk the mysterious\r\nstranger of his motoring adventure.\r\n\r\nYes, it was he--there could be no question about that. And yet, now\r\nthat his hat and heavy fur coat were removed he appeared surprisingly\r\nslender and youthful. His eyes, too, seemed bluer, his cheeks redder,\r\nand his mouth more smiling.\r\n\r\n"Well, shaver, you\'re prompt," announced he, pointing to the clock with\r\nevident satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"You said ten, sir."\r\n\r\n"So I did. Nevertheless, I often say ten and get quarter past ten or\r\neven eleven o\'clock. Sit down."\r\n\r\nHe motioned toward a huge leather chair at his elbow and slipping into\r\nit the boy perched with anticipation on its forward edge.\r\n\r\n"Well, what about that Miss Harling we were talking of yesterday? Has\r\nshe a position yet?"\r\n\r\n"Since last night, you mean? I don\'t know, sir. I haven\'t seen any of\r\nthe Harlings to-day. But I hardly think so."\r\n\r\nThe stranger pursed his lips.\r\n\r\n"Too bad! Too bad!" he murmured. "And you are still for helping the\r\nfamily out by taking a job, are you?"\r\n\r\n"If I can get one; yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Just what kind of work had you in mind?"\r\n\r\n"Why--I--I--hadn\'t thought about it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you go to school."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. That\'s the dickens of it. My mother makes me. I\'d a great\r\ndeal rather go into Davis and Coulter\'s cotton mills. Lots of boys and\r\ngirls my age do go there, and that is where my father worked before he\r\ndied. But Ma is hot on education. She says I\'ve got to have one, and\r\nshe insists on sewing at home on all sorts of fool flummeries for some\r\ndressmaker so I can. It\'s rotten of me not to be more pleased about it,\r\nI suppose."\r\n\r\nWhile Carl fumbled with his cap the man at the desk tilted back in his\r\nchair, regarding him narrowly.\r\n\r\n"Your school work can\'t leave you very much time for anything else,"\r\nremarked he.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, it does," the lad hastened to retort. "I have Saturdays\r\nand--and--spare hours at night. I\'d even work Sundays if there was\r\nanything I could do."\r\n\r\n"At that rate I am afraid you would not find much time for skating or\r\nbaseball. People have to have fresh air and exercise, you know, to keep\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t have to play," protested Carl with great earnestness. "Anyhow\r\nI get heaps of exercise and fresh air doing errands. Besides, we live\r\nup five flights."\r\n\r\nHis listener turned aside his head.\r\n\r\n"If it comes to exercise I get all I want right at home," persisted the\r\nboy. "I\'ve a crew of little brothers and sisters, too, and when I\'m not\r\nbusy I help take care of them so Ma can sew. Just you try doing it once\r\nif you are looking for exercise. And then I wheel the baby out."\r\n\r\nThere was a twinkle in the eye of the man at the desk but he said\r\ngravely:\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it going to bother them at home if you take a position? How does\r\nyour mother feel about it?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t had a chance to ask her," Carl blurted out with honesty.\r\n"All last evening she was rushing to finish that spangled thing; and\r\nthis morning she had the kids to dress and I had errands to do. It\'s\r\nawful hard to get a chance to talk to Ma by herself. Some of the\r\nchildren are always clawing at her skirts and bothering her."\r\n\r\n"You do believe, though, in talking things over with your mother."\r\n\r\n"Sure! We always tell Ma everything if we can get a chance. So does all\r\nMulberry Court, for that matter. Ma\'s that sort."\r\n\r\nThe stranger toyed with an ivory letter-opener thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'ll tell you what we\'ll do," began he at last. "To-day is\r\nSaturday, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nCarl nodded.\r\n\r\n"Well, if your friends, the Harlings, are not straightened out by\r\nMonday morning I will let you begin a week from to-day as errand boy in\r\nthis office."\r\n\r\n"Bully!" cried the delighted applicant.\r\n\r\n"If, on the other hand," continued the gentleman at the desk, speaking\r\nslowly and evenly, and not heeding the interruption, "Miss Harling\r\nfinds work and the family do not need your aid, you must agree to put\r\nin your free time at home helping your mother as you have been doing in\r\nthe past. Is that a bargain?"\r\n\r\n"Y-e-s."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"It just seems to me we might as well settle it definitely now that I\r\nam to come here next week. To-day is Saturday and I don\'t believe\r\nLouise will find work before Monday morning. Of course she can\'t do\r\nanything about getting a job Sunday."\r\n\r\nAlthough there was a perceptible tremor of disappointment in the boy\'s\r\nvoice the stranger appeared not to notice it. Rising, he put out his\r\nhand with a kindly smile.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid the agreement I have made with you is the best I can do at\r\npresent," said he. "I will be true to my part of it if you will be true\r\nto yours. I promise you that if the Harlings\' affairs do not take an\r\nupward turn by Monday you shall come to their rescue."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t worry any more about this, if I were you, sonny," concluded\r\nthe man. "Go home and try to be satisfied. I\'ll keep the place for you,\r\nremember. It is Carl McGregor, isn\'t it, of----"\r\n\r\n"Mulberry Court--the top flat."\r\n\r\n"And did you tell me these friends of yours, the Harlings, lived there\r\ntoo?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, sir! I wish they did. The Harlings are at Number 40 Broad\r\nStreet. It is the corner house. They took the tenement because there\r\nwas sun, and because it entertains Grandfather and Mrs. Harling to look\r\nout the window. They can\'t ever go out and it cheers them up to have\r\nsomething to see. It costs more to live there than where we do, but Hal\r\nand Louise decided it was worth it."\r\n\r\n"Under the circumstances I imagine it is," assented the stranger.\r\n"Well, we will wish them luck."\r\n\r\n"I hope they have it!"\r\n\r\n"So do I." As he spoke the man pressed a bell in answer to which the\r\nuniformed page appeared.\r\n\r\n"Show this young gentleman out, Billie," said he. "Good-by, youngster!\r\nGood-by!"\r\n\r\nThe farewell was cordial and in its cadence rang so disconcerting a\r\nfinality that try as he might Carl could not repress a conviction that\r\nin spite of his suave promises his new-found friend did not really\r\nexpect to see him again.\r\n\r\n"I guess there are folks like that," meditated he, as he walked\r\ndispiritedly home. "They are awful pleasant to your face and give you\r\nthe feeling they are going to do wonders for you. But when it comes to\r\nthe scratch they slide from under. This chap is one of that slick\r\nbunch, I\'ll bet a hat."\r\n\r\nIt was not a cheering reflection and with every step lower and lower\r\nebbed his hopes. It chanced that his pathway to Mulberry Court led past\r\nthe corner of Broad Street (or if it did not really lead him there his\r\nsubconscious mind did) and once in the vicinity what more natural than\r\nthat he should drop in at Number 40 to pass the time of day?\r\nGrandfather Harling loved to have visitors. He said they cheered him\r\nup.\r\n\r\nBut to-day neither the old gentleman nor any of the Harling family\r\nneeded cheering. Carl found them in such high spirits that for a time\r\nit was difficult to get any of the group to talk coherently.\r\n\r\n"What do you suppose has happened, Carl?" cried Louise, the instant he\r\nwas inside the door. "The most wonderful thing! You never could guess\r\nif you guessed forever."\r\n\r\n"If it is as hopeless as that I shan\'t try," laughed Carl.\r\n\r\n"But it is amazing, a miracle!" put in Mrs. Harling.\r\n\r\n"We can\'t understand it at all," quavered Grandfather Harling, who was\r\nquite as excited as the rest.\r\n\r\n"Well, what _is_ it?" the boy demanded.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll never believe it," laughed Louise with shining eyes. "I\'ve had\r\na letter. You couldn\'t guess who it\'s from!"\r\n\r\nShe held a square white envelope high above her head.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to have it framed and hand it down to my\r\ngreat-great-grandchildren."\r\n\r\n"You might let me see it," coaxed Carl, putting out his hand.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is far too precious to be touched. It is going to be an\r\narchive, an heirloom, you know."\r\n\r\n"Oh, come on and tell a chap what\'s happened," urged Carl, his patience\r\nbeginning to wane.\r\n\r\n"Well, think of this! I\'ve had a note from Mr. Coulter--not from the\r\nfirm, understand, but from the great J. W. himself, written by his own\r\nhand. He says he hears that through some error my name has been dropped\r\nfrom the Davis and Coulter payroll, and he not only asks me to come\r\nback to the mill but sends me a cheek for double the sum that I have\r\nlost by being out. Can you beat that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Louise, how bully! I _am_ glad! But how do you suppose----"\r\n\r\n"That\'s exactly what we don\'t know. It seems like magic, doesn\'t it? I\r\nnever knew before that Mr. Coulter kept such close track of what went\r\non at the mills. He doesn\'t come there often because he is always at\r\nthe down-town office. When he does visit the mills he simply strolls\r\nthrough them as if they belonged to somebody else rather than to\r\nhimself. Of course he doesn\'t know one of the workers and I\'ve always\r\nfancied he didn\'t care much about us. But this proves how wrong I was\r\nto think so. He does care, you see, and means everybody shall have a\r\nsquare deal. I shall go back Monday and work harder than ever for him.\r\nYou will work your fingers off for such a man as that, you know."\r\n\r\n"It certainly is white of him!" Carl agreed.\r\n\r\n"It is nothing but justice," asserted Mrs. Harling proudly. "Still,\r\njustice isn\'t a common commodity in this world."\r\n\r\n"Evidently it isn\'t Mr. Coulter\'s fault if it isn\'t, Mother," Louise\r\nreplied. "And isn\'t it nice, Carl, that I am not to go back to work\r\nunder Mr. Corcoran. Oh, I forgot to tell you that. That is almost the\r\nbest of all. No! I am to be in the shipping department where the work\r\nis lighter and the pay better. Won\'t Hal be tickled to death when he\r\nhears it? He\'ll be more convinced than ever that he did the right thing\r\nto lay Corcoran out."\r\n\r\n"I think he did. Still, it was a dangerous experiment and this should\r\nbe a warning to him," put in Mrs. Harling. "Hal must learn to be more\r\ncareful with his temper, his tongue, and those fists of his. If he\r\nisn\'t he is going to get into serious trouble some day."\r\n\r\nCarl, however, was not listening to Mrs. Harling\'s moralizing.\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew how Mr. Coulter found out about Louise," murmured he,\r\nhalf aloud.\r\n\r\nWell, this was certainly a most satisfactory termination to the\r\nHarlings\' troubles. He was genuinely glad the affair had turned so\r\nfortunately. And yet in his heart lurked a vague regret. This would\r\nmean that probably he would never see or hear from the mysterious hero\r\nof the red racing car again. Could the stranger have had any knowledge\r\nof what was to happen and did that information account for his jaunty\r\nadieu? Of course such a thing was impossible. And yet how odd and\r\npuzzling it all was!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE WEB WIDENS\r\n\r\n\r\n"Wherever did you disappear to?" inquired his mother when, hungry but\r\ntriumphant, Carl came home. "I\'ve been looking everywhere for you."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know you wanted me this morning, Ma," the boy replied, an\r\nafterglow of happiness still on his face.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t really want you but I wanted to know where you were. I\'ve\r\nasked you time and time again when you go out to tell me where you\'re\r\ngoing."\r\n\r\n"I wanted to, Mother, but it was such a long story. Last night you were\r\ntoo busy to hear it; and this morning there was no chance to talk to\r\nyou either."\r\n\r\nHe heard his mother sigh.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pretty kind of a life I lead if my own children can\'t get a\r\nminute to talk to me."\r\n\r\n"But you are busy, Ma. You know you are."\r\n\r\n"I certainly do. Nobody knows it better," replied the woman with a sad\r\nshake of her head.\r\n\r\nCarl, sensing the regret in her tone, hastened to say:\r\n\r\n"Well, at least the family is not so thick around here now as usual.\r\nWhere is everybody?"\r\n\r\n"Mary is out with James Frederick; Timmie has gone to the park to\r\ncoast; and Martin and Nell are at the day nursery."\r\n\r\n"Then we have it all to ourselves."\r\n\r\n"For a second or two, yes."\r\n\r\n"That\'s bully!"\r\n\r\nDrawing up a kitchen chair he sat down beside his mother.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nice to have them gone sometimes," remarked he. "The kids make\r\nsuch a racket."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll not always be making it," returned Mrs. McGregor philosophically.\r\n"And anyway, the three of them put together can never equal the\r\nhullabaloo you used to make when you were their age."\r\n\r\n"I\'m quiet enough now," grinned Carl sheepishly.\r\n\r\n"Quiet, you call it, do you? Quiet! And you prancing home from every\r\nball game with a black eye or else the clothes half torn off you!" She\r\nchuckled mischievously. "But you\'re not telling me where you\'ve been.\r\nUp to some deviltry, I\'ll be bound, or you wouldn\'t be so anxious to\r\nget it off your conscience."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been up to any high jinks this time, Ma," protested the lad\r\nsoberly. "You\'ll see when I tell you."\r\n\r\nSlowly he related his story while his mother bent over her needle,\r\nspangling with brilliants a gauze of azure hue. She was a wonderful\r\nlistener, sympathetic in her intentness.\r\n\r\nWhen the boy had finished her hand wandered to touch his rough sleeve.\r\n\r\n"A kind deed is never amiss in the world," observed she briefly. "If we\r\nwould but pass on to other folks the kindness people do to us the world\r\nwould soon become a pleasanter place. I\'m thankful to know Louise has\r\nher job back, or rather that she has a better one. She\'s a good girl\r\nand deserves it. Besides, with Christmas coming, it would be hard to be\r\nwithout money."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Coulter--wasn\'t he great? And wasn\'t it all funny?"\r\n\r\n"Funny is hardly the word; but I\'ll agree that Mr. Coulter was great.\r\nIt is always great for a big man to take on his soul the troubles of\r\nthose needier than himself. Well, he\'s done a good deed this day and\r\nmay he be the happier for it. And he will be--never fear! I wonder how\r\nhe got wind of the trouble Louise was in? You don\'t suppose----" She\r\nhalted a moment as if suddenly struck by a new thought; then she\r\nlaughed and shrugged her shoulders, "Of course it couldn\'t be--how\r\nridiculous! Well, anyway, it is splendid everything has come out so\r\nwell. And now that you\'re here, sonny, would you mind fetching some\r\ncoal from the shed and starting up the fire for dinner? Mary\'ll be back\r\nsoon and \'twould be a nice surprise for her to find the kettle\r\nboiling."\r\n\r\n"So it would!" answered Carl, leaping up to do his mother\'s bidding.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not forgetting you\'d like to do a bit of coasting or skating\r\nto-day," Mrs. McGregor continued. "If you will fit in a few errands\r\nearly in the afternoon I\'ll let you off at two o\'clock for a holiday."\r\n\r\n"That will be great, Ma! But--but don\'t you----"\r\n\r\n"It will be all right, sonny. Tim has had his play this morning and he\r\nshall help the rest of the day. Hush a minute! Isn\'t that Mrs. O\'Dowd\'s\r\nknock? Very like she\'s up to ask me to run down and see little Katie\r\nwho is laid up with a sore throat. Well, I\'ll go but I won\'t be long.\r\nMeantime if you can lend Mary a hand dinner will be through the quicker\r\nand you will be off to play the earlier."\r\n\r\nThus it happened that before two o\'clock Carl McGregor was one of the\r\nshouting throng of boys that crowded the small pond in Davis Park. Amid\r\nswirling skaters and a confusion of hockey sticks he moved in and out\r\nthe thick of the game. So intent was he upon the sport that he might\r\nhave continued playing until dark had not a boy at his elbow suddenly\r\npiped:\r\n\r\n"There goes Hal Harling! Hi, Hal! Come on down!"\r\n\r\n"Harling! Harling!" cried the other boys, taking up the call.\r\n\r\n"Come on and play, Hal! You can have Sanderson\'s skates. He\'s going\r\nhome."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t do it!" laughed the giant, waving his hand.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come on, old top!"\r\n\r\n"Not to-night, fellers! Got to go home."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to see Harling!" Carl exclaimed, hurriedly loosening his\r\nskates.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not going, too!"\r\n\r\n"Got to. So long! Hold on, Hal! I\'m coming with you."\r\n\r\nScrambling up the bank, Carl overtook his friend.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Carlie! What struck you to quit?" asked he unceremoniously.\r\n\r\n"Time I was getting home. Besides, I wanted to see you."\r\n\r\nA smile passed between them.\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth, I hoped I\'d spy you somewhere, kid. I\'ve got great\r\nnews! Corcoran has been fired! What do you know about that?"\r\n\r\n"Corcoran!"\r\n\r\n"The old man himself--no other!"\r\n\r\n"Jove! Why, I thought you said he\'d been at the mills all his life."\r\n\r\n"So he has."\r\n\r\n"But--but--to fire him now!"\r\n\r\n"Well, he hasn\'t actually been fired," amended young Harling, "but so\r\nfar as I\'m concerned it amounts to the same thing. He\'s been\r\ntransferred to another department and he isn\'t to be a boss any more,\r\npoor old chap!"\r\n\r\n"But aren\'t you glad?" questioned Carl with surprise.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, in some ways," returned Hal thoughtfully. "Yes, of course\r\nI\'m glad not to have him sarsing the girls and pestering me. Still, I\'m\r\nsort of sorry for him."\r\n\r\n"_Sorry?_"\r\n\r\nHal nodded.\r\n\r\n"But I thought you----"\r\n\r\n"I know! I know! I\'m not saying he wasn\'t an awful old screw. But\r\nsomehow I don\'t believe he meant to be so flinty-hearted. You see, he\r\ncame and talked to me to-day--talked like a regular human being. You\r\ncould have knocked me over. It seems--a funny thing--that kid I picked\r\nup out of the street the other day was his."\r\n\r\n"Corcoran\'s kid!"\r\n\r\n"Yep! Can you beat it? Of course I hadn\'t a notion who the little tike\r\nbelonged to; but even if I had I should have done the same thing. You\r\nwouldn\'t let a kid like that be run over no matter who his father was."\r\n\r\n"But--but--Corcoran!" gasped Carl. "How did he know it was you who\r\nrescued his baby?"\r\n\r\n"Somebody told him. He said it cut him up terribly because of the way\r\nhe\'d treated Louise."\r\n\r\n"Served him right."\r\n\r\n"Maybe! But he was cut up, poor old cuss! You\'d have been sorry for him\r\nyourself, if you\'d heard him. He isn\'t all brute by any means. Why,\r\nwhen he spoke about his little boy----"\r\n\r\n"But Louise!"\r\n\r\n"I know. It was a low-down trick and he said so himself. But he\r\ndeclared it was an ill wind that blew nobody good, and he hinted that\r\nmaybe in consequence of the trouble she would be better off than if it\r\nhadn\'t happened."\r\n\r\nCarl bit his tongue to keep it silent. How he longed to impart to his\r\nchum the good tidings that would greet him when he reached home! But he\r\nmust not spoil Louise\'s pleasure by telling the story of her good luck\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, somehow things do seem to come round right if you wait long\r\nenough," mumbled he.\r\n\r\n"So mother says," echoed Hal moodily. "But you get almighty sick of\r\nwaiting sometimes. Even knowing you were right doesn\'t put pennies in\r\nyour pocket." He laughed with a touch of bitterness.\r\n\r\nAgain Carl was tempted to break the silence and reveal the wonderful\r\nsecret, and again he clamped his lips together.\r\n\r\nHal would hear the tidings soon enough now and his spirits would soar\r\nthe higher because of the depths to which they had descended. It was\r\nalways so. This broad range of mood was one of his chief charms.\r\n\r\nAh, how well he knew his friend and how accurately did he forecast what\r\nwould happen!\r\n\r\nIt was not five minutes after the two parted at the corner before Hal\r\nHarling came leaping up the McGregors\' stairway and gave a loud knock\r\nat their door.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you old tight-jaw!" announced he, when on entering, he beheld Carl\r\ngrinning at him from across the room. "You might have put me out of my\r\nmisery."\r\n\r\nThe boy laughed.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t my secret! I\'d have been a cur to butt in on Louise\'s fun."\r\n\r\n"So you would!"\r\n\r\nQuietly Mrs. McGregor glanced up from the sea of delicate blue gauze\r\nfoaming about her.\r\n\r\n"A ready tongue is a gift of silver, but a silent one is a treasure of\r\npure gold," observed she quaintly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF THE FAIRY GODMOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the Harlings safely out of their difficulties Christmas, as Carl\r\njestingly observed, was free to approach and approach it did with a\r\nspeed incredible of belief. A big blizzard a week before it, which\r\ntransformed the suburban districts into a wonderland of beauty, merely\r\nworked havoc however in Baileyville, causing muddy streets and slippery\r\npavements, and wrecking the skating in the park.\r\n\r\n"Snow doesn\'t seem to be made for cities," remarked Mrs. McGregor in\r\nreply to Carl\'s lamentations. "It is an old-fashioned institution that\r\nbelongs to the past. Here in town there is neither a place for it nor\r\ndoes it do an atom of good to anybody unless it is the unemployed who\r\nhail the work it brings."\r\n\r\n"I hate the snow," wailed Timmie. "It isn\'t snow, anyway; it\'s just\r\nslush."\r\n\r\n"Ah, laddie, you should see one of the snowstorms of the old country!"\r\nprotested his Scotch mother reminiscently. "Then you would not say you\r\nhated the snow. It turned everything it touched white as a Tartary\r\nlamb."\r\n\r\n"What\'s a Tartary lamb, Mother?" inquired Tim with interest.\r\n\r\n"A Tartary lamb? Ask your big brother; he goes to school."\r\n\r\n"I never heard of a Tartary lamb, Ma," flushed Carl.\r\n\r\n"Mary had a little lamb," began Nell, who had caught the phrase.\r\n\r\n"So she did, darling," laughed her mother as she picked up the child\r\nand kissed her, "and its fleece was white as snow, too, for the song\r\nsays so; but it wasn\'t a Tartary lamb, dearie. It was just a common\r\none."\r\n\r\n"What is a Tartary lamb, anyway, Ma?" Mary demanded.\r\n\r\nMrs. McGregor paused to put a length of silk into her needle.\r\n\r\n"Long ago," began she, "before there were ships and trains, to say\r\nnothing of automobiles and aeroplanes people had to stay at home in the\r\nplaces where they happened to be born. Of course they could go by coach\r\nor on horseback to a near-by city, but they could not go far; nor\r\nindeed did they think of going because they did not know there was\r\nanywhere to go. Nobody did any traveling in those days and as a result\r\nthere were no maps or travel books to set you thinking you must pack up\r\nyour traps to-morrow and start for some place you never had seen. But\r\nby and by the compass was invented, larger and better ships came to be\r\nbuilt, and men got the idea the world was round instead of flat (as\r\nthey had at one time supposed), a discovery that comforted vastly the\r\ntimid souls who had always been afraid of falling off the edge of it.\r\nTherefore, when it was at last proved that should you sail far, far\r\naway your ship, instead of dropping off into space, would circle the\r\ngreat ball we live on and come home again, some of those who were\r\nbrave, adventurous, and had money enough set out on voyages to see what\r\nthere was to be seen in other lands than those they had been brought up\r\nin. Frenchmen thought it would be a grand thing to discover new\r\ncountries for France; Englishmen wanted new territory for England. So\r\nit was all over the world. Thus this one and that one began to travel."\r\n\r\n"Just as Columbus came to America, Ma," put in Tim.\r\n\r\n"Exactly, dear," nodded his mother. "Now you can imagine what a hero\r\nsuch a traveler became; how people admired his daring; and how half of\r\nthem wished they were going with him and the other half rejoiced that\r\nthey weren\'t. And when he came back there was great excitement to hear\r\nwhere he had been and what he had seen! Every word he spoke was passed\r\nfrom mouth to mouth, each person who repeated it adding to the story\r\nuntil it grew like a snowball. And as was inevitable the more raptly\r\nthe populace listened the more marvelous became the stories."\r\n\r\n"Like Jack Murphy when he gets home from the circus," put in Tim.\r\n\r\n"Yes, very much like Jack Murphy, I am afraid; only sometimes these\r\ntravelers really believed the tales they told. Sometimes the stories\r\nhad been passed on to them by the natives of the strange countries they\r\nvisited, and how could they know that all which was told them was not\r\ntrue? Such a tale was the legend of the Tartary lamb."\r\n\r\n"Tell it to us, Mother," urged Mary.\r\n\r\n"Well, it actually isn\'t much of a story, my dear. You see, when the\r\ntravelers from England, France, and other western countries went to the\r\nEast for the first time, they saw cotton growing, or if they did not\r\nreally see it, they heard there was such a thing. Now cotton was\r\nentirely new to the voyagers and it seemed unbelievable that such a\r\nplant could be. Some of the eastern natives told the visitors that in\r\neach pod grew a little lamb with soft, white fleece. Orientals were\r\nvery ignorant in those days. The Tartars went even farther and said the\r\nlamb bent the stalk he lived on down to the ground and ate all the food\r\nwithin reach; and when he had nibbled up all the grass and roots around\r\nhim he died, and then it was that people took his fleece and twisted it\r\ninto thread, which was woven into garments. Thus the legend became\r\nestablished and the belief in the Tartary lamb became so firm that for\r\nseveral hundred years people even in England thought that in the Far\r\nEast there grew this wonderful plant with a vegetable lamb sprouting\r\nfrom the top of it."\r\n\r\n"How silly of them!" sniffed Carl.\r\n\r\n"No sillier than lots of the things we now believe, probably," replied\r\nhis mother. "Aren\'t we constantly discovering how mistaken some of our\r\ncherished beliefs were? That is what progress is. We learn continually\r\nto cast aside outgrown notions and adopt wiser and better ones. So it\r\nwas in the past. The world was very young in those days, you must\r\nremember, and people did not know so much about it as we do now. And\r\neven we, with all our wisdom, are going to be laughed at years hence,\r\nprecisely as you are laughing now about those who believed the story of\r\nthe Tartary lamb. Men are going to say: \'_Think of those poor, stupid\r\nold things back in nineteen hundred and twenty-three who believed\r\nso-and-so! How could they have done it?_\'"\r\n\r\nCarl was silent.\r\n\r\n"When you consider this you will understand how it was that the eager\r\nreaders of the past devoured with wide-open eyes the tale-telling of\r\nSir John Mandeville; and should you ever read that ancient story, as I\r\nhope you will sometime, you will be less surprised to hear that even he\r\ndeclared that he had seen cotton growing and that when the pod of the\r\nplant was cut open inside it was a little creature like a lamb. The\r\nnatives of the East ate both the fruit of the plant and the wee beast,\r\nhe explained. In fact he said he had eaten the thing himself."\r\n\r\n"Why, the very idea!" gasped Mary.\r\n\r\n"What a lie!" Carl burst out.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid Sir John was either not very truthful or he had a great\r\nimagination," smiled Mrs. McGregor. "Still, you see, he was not alone\r\nin his belief about the Tartary lamb. So many other people believed the\r\nyarn that he probably thought he was telling the truth. And as for\r\neating it--well, he just had a strain of Jack Murphy in him. Besides,\r\nthere were no schools in 1322 to teach Sir John Mandeville better. And\r\nanyway, who was to contradict the fable? Sir John had been to the East\r\nand the other people hadn\'t. Why shouldn\'t they believe what he and\r\nother travelers told them?"\r\n\r\n"He did sort of have them, didn\'t he?" grinned Carl.\r\n\r\n"How long was it before the public stopped believing such a ridiculous\r\nstory?" demanded Mary.\r\n\r\n"About three hundred years," answered her mother. "In the meantime much\r\ntraveling had been done by the peoples of all nations and learning had\r\nmade great strides. Scientific men began to whisper there could be no\r\nsuch thing as the lamb of the Tartars; it was not possible. Cotton was\r\nmerely a plant. You can imagine what discussions such an assertion as\r\nthat raised. The public had come to like the notion of the Tartary lamb\r\nand did not wish to give it up; besides, if the story were all a myth,\r\nit put the travelers who had told it in a very bad light, and shook the\r\nconfidence of readers in some of the other tales they had published.\r\nScience always upsets us. None of us like to be jolted out of the\r\nbeliefs we have been brought up with and exchange them for others, no\r\nmatter how good the new ones are. So it was in sixteen hundred. The\r\npopulace resented having the Tartary lamb taken away from them."\r\n\r\nMrs. McGregor laughed.\r\n\r\n"It was a pity Sir John Mandeville and the rest did not live long\r\nenough to learn how mistaken they had been," mused Mary.\r\n\r\n"Poor old Sir John! I guess it was as well for him that he didn\'t, for\r\nin his day he was, you see, quite a celebrity. He might not have\r\nrelished living to see his fame evaporate. At least he had the courage\r\nto make a trip to a strange and distant land, and for that we should\r\nrespect him since it took nerve to travel in those days. Moreover he\r\ndid his part and was a link in a civilization that went on after he was\r\ngone. So the history of the world is built up. Each generation builds\r\non the blunders of the one before it--or should."\r\n\r\n"How queer it makes you feel; and how small!" Mary reflected.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it just seems as if we didn\'t count for much," sighed the girl.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, dear child, we count for a great deal," instantly\r\nretorted her mother. "Each one of us can have a share in the vast plan\r\nof the universe and help carry it forward."\r\n\r\n"How, Mother?"\r\n\r\n"By doing all we can during our lifetime to make the world better," was\r\nthe answer. "Good men and good women make a good world, don\'t they? And\r\nthe better the world the farther ahead will be its civilization.\r\nProgress is not all in wonderful discoveries of science, in fine\r\narchitecture, or in great books; much of it lies in the peoples of the\r\nglobe learning to live peacefully together and help one another.\r\nKindness to our neighbor, therefore, helps civilization. It cannot\r\navoid doing so if we live it on a large enough scale."\r\n\r\n"I never thought of that before," meditated Carl.\r\n\r\n"But you can see it is so, laddie," responded his mother. "A lack of\r\nkindness and fairness in nations causes wars, and wars put the world\r\nbackward. It is in the peaceful times that nations grow. You know\r\nyourself that you cannot build up anything when somebody else is\r\nwaiting to knock it down the minute you have it finished. Under such\r\nconditions it hardly seems worth while to build at all. So it is with\r\nnations the world over. When they are snarling jealously at one\r\nanother\'s heels, and coveting what the other possesses, how can\r\nprogress be made?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose when they get mad they forget about the work of the world,"\r\nTim announced.\r\n\r\n"That is just the trouble," agreed his mother. "Engrossed in their own\r\nlittle squabbles, they lose sight of the splendid big thing they were\r\nput here to do. In other words they forget their job, which is to make\r\nthe world and themselves better."\r\n\r\nSlowly she glanced from one earnest face into another.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve read you quite a sermon, haven\'t I?" smiled she. "And it\r\nwas all because of the Tartary lamb. Now suppose we talk of something\r\nelse--Christmas. It will be here now before we know it. What shall we\r\ndo this year? Shall it be a tree? Or shall we hang our stockings, go\r\nwithout a tree, and put the money into a Christmas dinner?"\r\n\r\nInquiringly she studied her children\'s faces.\r\n\r\n"I suppose a tree does cost quite a lot before you are through with\r\nit," reflected the prudent Mary.\r\n\r\n"And we have the municipal tree in the park, anyway," Carl put in in an\r\nattempt to be optimistic.\r\n\r\n"But that tree isn\'t ours, our very own tree," Tim began to wail.\r\n\r\n"It is lots bigger than any tree we could have, Timmie," asserted his\r\nolder brother. "And think of the lights! They are all electric. We\r\ncouldn\'t have lights like those here at home."\r\n\r\n"I know," grieved Tim. "But it isn\'t our tree--just ours--in our\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"A Christmas tree costs ever so much money, Timmie," Mary explained\r\ngently. "Mother can\'t buy us a tree always and a dinner, too."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I could manage a small tree, perhaps," interrupted Mrs. McGregor,\r\ntouched at seeing the child so disappointed. "There are little ones at\r\nthe market."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want a little one," objected Tim stubbornly. "I want a\r\nbig, big Christmas tree."\r\n\r\n"Big as the ceiling--big as Mulberry Court," interrupted Martin,\r\nextending his chubby arms to their full length.\r\n\r\n"I wants a big tree, too," lisped Nell.\r\n\r\nMrs. McGregor sighed to herself. Evidently it was not going to be as\r\neasy to coax her flock away from their established traditions as she\r\nhad at first supposed. Each year she had made a stupendous effort to\r\nkeep Christmas after the old fashion; and each season the ceremony,\r\nbefore it was over, made appalling inroads on her slender purse. This\r\ntime it had been her plan to curtail expenses and put what was spent\r\ninto the more substantial and lasting things. But now as she glanced\r\nabout her her heart misgave her. Even Carl and Mary, valiantly as they\r\nfought for economy, and grown up though they were, could not altogether\r\nconceal the fact that they were disappointed; and as for the younger\r\nchildren, they were on the brink of tears.\r\n\r\n"Well, we won\'t decide to-day," announced their mother diplomatically.\r\n"We will think it over until to-morrow. By that time perhaps some way\r\ncan be found----"\r\n\r\nA knock at the door interrupted her.\r\n\r\n"Run to the door like a good boy, Timmie," said she. "Very likely it\'s\r\nthe boy from the corner grocery with the bundles of wood I ordered."\r\n\r\nTim rose with importance. Visitors to the fifth floor of Mulberry Court\r\nwere so few that to admit even so prosaic a one as the grocer\'s boy\r\nnever ceased to thrill him.\r\n\r\nTo-day, however, it was not the grocer\'s boy who stood peering at him\r\nfrom the dim hallway. In fact, it was no one he had ever seen before. A\r\nlittle old man stood there, a man with ruddy cheeks, a stern mouth, and\r\nblue eyes whose sharpness was softened by a moist, far-away expression.\r\nFrom beneath a nautical blue cap strayed a wisp or two of white hair.\r\nOtherwise, he was buttoned to his chin in a great coat, fastened with\r\nimposing brass buttons, dulled by much fingering.\r\n\r\nApprehensive at the sight, Tim backed into the room. Brass buttons, in\r\nhis limited experience, meant either firemen or policemen and either of\r\nthese dignitaries was equally terrifying.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know your Uncle Frederick, do you, sonny?" observed the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nThe voice, more than the words, brought Mrs. McGregor to her feet in an\r\ninstant, and what a rush she made for the door! Gauze, spangles,\r\nscissors, and spool flew in all directions and the children, deciding\r\nthat some unprecedented evil had befallen, stampeded after her.\r\n\r\nOpen-mouthed, they watched, while in the arms of the little old\r\ngentleman she laughed, cried, and uttered broken nothings quite\r\nunintelligible to anybody.\r\n\r\n"Who ever would have thought to see you, Frederick!" gasped she at\r\nlast, as wiping her eyes on the corner of her apron she dragged her\r\nvisitor into the room. "Children, come here one by one and speak to\r\nyour Uncle James Frederick Dillingham. This is Carl, the oldest one--a\r\ngood boy as ever lived (if he is always tearing his clothes). The next\r\nis Mary; she\'s going on thirteen and is quite a little housekeeper even\r\nnow. Timmie, who let you in, is nine. And here are Martin and Nell--the\r\nmites! James Frederick is asleep but when you see him you\'ll see the\r\nfinest baby you ever set your two eyes on. Kiss your uncle, children.\r\nYou know it\'s him you have to thank for many, many things."\r\n\r\nSlowly the children advanced, wonder (and if the truth must be told) no\r\nsmall measure of chagrin in their crestfallen countenances.\r\n\r\nWas this apparition the fairy prince of their imaginings--this little\r\ngray man with his long coat and oilskin bundle? Why, he might be Mike\r\nCarrigan, the butcher; or Davie Ryan, the proprietor of the fruit\r\nstand, for anything his appearance denoted. Their dreams were in the\r\ndust. Still, youth is hopeful and they did not quite let go the\r\nexpectation that when the long coat that disguised him had been removed\r\nand the magic bundle opened Uncle Frederick Dillingham would issue\r\nforth in a garb startling, resplendent, and more in accordance with\r\ntheir mental pictures of him. But to their profound disappointment,\r\nwhen the great coat was tossed aside, it concealed no ermine-robed\r\nhero; nor was there crown or scepter in the bundle. Instead there stood\r\nin their midst a very plain, kindly little man arrayed in a shiny suit\r\nof blue serge that was almost shabby. The buttons, to be sure, had\r\nanchors on them; but they were dim, lusterless old anchors that looked\r\nas if they had been sunk in the depths of the sea until their golden\r\nglory had been tarnished by the washings of a million waves.\r\n\r\nNell eyed him and at length began to cry.\r\n\r\n"Policeman!" she whimpered, hiding her face in her mother\'s skirt.\r\n\r\n"Hush, girlie! Don\'t be silly," protested Mrs. McGregor hurriedly.\r\n"Your uncle is no policeman, though he may get one if you don\'t stop\r\nthat noise."\r\n\r\nAt that the little old man laughed a hearty, ringing laugh, so good to\r\nhear that in spite of themselves the whole family joined in it. After\r\nthat, everything was easy. Uncle James Frederick Dillingham tucked his\r\ncoat, cap, and bundle away in a corner and allowed his sister to seat\r\nhim in the rocking-chair before the stove.\r\n\r\n"Put another shovelful of coal on the fire, Carl," said she briskly.\r\n"And Mary, do you slip out to the market and fetch home a beefsteak and\r\nsome onions. You were ever fond of a steak smothered in onions,\r\nFrederick. Timmie, you shall set the table with a place for your uncle\r\nFrederick at the head, remember. And Nell, trot to the shed, darling,\r\nand bring mother a nice lot of potatoes. Go softly so not to waken\r\nJames Frederick."\r\n\r\nPromptly her host sprang to obey her.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, Brother," murmured she, "I\'ve scarcely got my breath yet.\r\nI never was so surprised in all my born days as to see you standing\r\nthere on the mat! Wherever did you come from? We\'ve not heard from you\r\nfor weeks and I had begun to fear something might have gone amiss."\r\n\r\nCaptain Dillingham patted her hand with his horny one.\r\n\r\n"We had a long trip home, Nellie, because of strong head winds,"\r\nexplained he. "Then, too, there were ports to stop at and cargo to\r\nunload. Add to this a fracas with the engine and you\'ll readily\r\nunderstand why I had only scant time for letter writing. I never was\r\nany too good at it, at best, you know."\r\n\r\n"Men never are," returned Mrs. McGregor cheerily over her shoulder as\r\nshe hustled out of the pantry with a clean tablecloth. "But it matters\r\nnot now; the ship is safe in port and you are here in time for\r\nChristmas--a miracle that\'s never happened before in all my memory."\r\n\r\n"But----," began her brother doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"But what? Surely you\'re not going to say you are putting straight off\r\nto-morrow for India or some other heathen spot! No shipowners would be\r\nso heartless as to ask you to do that. Besides, very like the\r\n_Charlotte_ must need repairing after such a stiff trip. Oughtn\'t her\r\nseams to be caulked or something?"\r\n\r\nCaptain Dillingham\'s eyes twinkled and the corners of his mouth curved\r\nupward.\r\n\r\n"You\'re quite knowing in nautical matters, Nellie," observed he with\r\namusement. "Aye, the _Charlotte_ will have to lay to and be\r\noverhauled some. She had a tough voyage. Still, she don\'t mind it much.\r\nShe\'s a thoroughbred that takes what comes without whimpering. That\'s\r\nthe lady of her. I never have to offer excuses or apologies for\r\nher--no, siree! Tell her what you want done and you can count on her\r\ndoing it every time."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry you didn\'t have a better voyage home," ventured his sister.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the voyage was all right enough. You can\'t expect a marble floor\r\nto sail on in December. Indeed a trip such as that would be almost too\r\ntame for me. I like the kick of the sea. Still, heavy winds that hold\r\nyou back all the way over as these held us, are trying. You make but\r\nslow progress against them. Nevertheless the _Charlotte_ put up a\r\nstiff fight and don\'t you forget it."\r\n\r\n"Had you any storms this trip?"\r\n\r\n"Storms? Oh, I believe we did strike a gale or two, now I come to think\r\nof it. I recall there was a nasty typhoon in the Indian Ocean that kept\r\nus busy for a while. But such happenings are all in the day\'s work and\r\nafter they are over are forgotten."\r\n\r\nCarl, busy at his task of slicing the bread, gasped. Gales and\r\ntyphoons! And the Indian Ocean to boot! And his uncle mentioned them\r\nall as if they were no more than flies on the wall. He had seen the\r\nIndian Ocean on the map--an area of blue edged about with patches of\r\npink, green, and yellow; but he certainly had never expected to meet in\r\nthe flesh anybody who had sailed its waters.\r\n\r\nUncle Frederick Dillingham suddenly began to take on in his eyes an\r\naspect quite new; an aspect so alluring that when contrasted with the\r\nmyth of purple and ermine the latter tradition shriveled into something\r\nvery minor in importance. Was not the master of a ship a far more\r\nintriguing character than a dull old king who did nothing but sit on a\r\ncrimson velvet throne and wave a scepter?\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have much to tell us, Frederick," declared Mrs. McGregor,\r\nputting the potatoes into the oven. "The children know little of\r\nforeign lands. Nor do I know as much of them as I would. \'Twill be\r\ngrand to hear where you\'ve been and what you\'ve seen."\r\n\r\n"Did you go to China, Uncle Frederick?" Carl inquired timidly.\r\n\r\n"Aye! And to India and Japan, laddie."\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s eyes glowed with excitement.\r\n\r\n"Oh, wouldn\'t I like to sail on a big ship to some place that was\r\ndifferent from Mulberry Court!" cried he.\r\n\r\n"The places I\'ve been in lately were certainly different from Mulberry\r\nCourt!" sighed Captain Dillingham. "And perhaps had you seen them you\r\nwould be as glad as I am to be at Mulberry Court."\r\n\r\n"Maybe! I\'d like a peep at something else, though."\r\n\r\n"Maybe some day you\'ll be having it," returned the sea captain\r\njocosely. "Who knows! I may be taking you to India with me when you\'re\r\nolder."\r\n\r\n"_Frederick!_" came from Mrs. McGregor in a horrified tone.\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t like to see the shaver starting off for India, Nellie?\r\nAnd why not?" laughed her brother. "India is a fine country. Besides,\r\ntraveling the world is a great way to study its geography. I\'ll be\r\nwilling to wager, now, that not one of these older children, though\r\nthey have been to school since they were knee high, could tell me\r\noffhand where the Suez Canal is."\r\n\r\nConsternation greeted the assertion and there was dead silence.\r\n\r\n"There! What did I tell you?" returned Captain Dillingham triumphantly.\r\n"And should I try them on the Bay of Biscay or the Ganges it would be\r\nno better."\r\n\r\nThe stillness was oppressive.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t there--didn\'t I read somewhere that there are crocodiles in the\r\nGanges?" Carl managed to stammer.\r\n\r\nHis uncle chuckled.\r\n\r\n"There\'s hope for you, son," he answered. "To know there are crocodiles\r\nin the Ganges is something. Perhaps I shall make a tourist of you yet.\r\nBut you will have to know a little more about this globe of ours before\r\nI can do it, I\'m afraid."\r\n\r\n"I hate geography," announced Tim, who had been listening and now with\r\ndisconcerting frankness proclaimed his aversion in no uncertain terms.\r\n"All it is is little squares of color."\r\n\r\nCaptain Dillingham glanced toward his sister and met her wry smile.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what books do for you," acclaimed he. "They make the romance of\r\nthe Orient nothing but patchwork." Then to Tim he continued, "I can\r\nteach you better geography than that, laddie. Countries aren\'t just\r\nlittle pieces of pink, yellow, or blue paper laid together. They are\r\npeople, rivers, mountains; tea, sugar, and cotton; ivory, elephants,\r\nand carved temples."\r\n\r\nThe children had drawn closer around his knee.\r\n\r\n"Tell us about the elephants," pleaded Tim, with shining eyes.\r\n\r\n"There, you see! You are begging already for a lesson in\r\ngeography--much as you dislike it!" teased his uncle.\r\n\r\n"There can be no geography lessons now," objected Mrs. McGregor. "The\r\nsteak is done and mustn\'t be spoiled with waiting. Show your uncle\r\nwhere to sit, Mary. And, Timmie, bring the salt. It\'s been forgotten.\r\nYou\'ll have to bring a chair from my room, Martin. Remember James\r\nFrederick and go on your toes."\r\n\r\n"Now, Frederick," smiled his sister mischievously, "admit that even in\r\nIndia you\'ve seen nothing better than this beefsteak."\r\n\r\n"\'Twill take no coaxing to make me admit that, my dear," returned\r\nCaptain Dillingham. "Not all the sultans of the east could produce a\r\ndish as royal as this one."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF COTTON\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of Uncle James Frederick Dillingham\'s arrival there\r\nbegan for the McGregor children an era of delight. The newly found\r\nrelative, they soon discovered, was not only all they had pictured, but\r\nmore--far more!\r\n\r\nHe did not, it is true, actually live at Mulberry Court, for because of\r\nthe crowded conditions of the McGregor home he took a room near-by;\r\nnevertheless he might as well have lived there for he only used his own\r\nroom to sleep in and stow away his luggage. Each morning just before\r\nbreakfast his step would be heard on the stairs and off would race the\r\nchildren in merry rivalry to see who would reach the door first and\r\nhave the honor of admitting him. Once inside the cosy kitchen he made\r\nit his headquarters and it did not take long to find out that he was a\r\nvaluable asset there.\r\n\r\nFor example who could fry fish so deliciously as he? And who could make\r\nsuch chowder? And as for washing dishes and wiping them he was quicker\r\nthan any of the young folks. To behold an officer in gold braid\r\npresiding at the dishpan at first caused a protest from Mrs. McGregor;\r\nbut when the little old man asserted that it was a treat to be inside a\r\nhome and handle a mop and soap-shaker what could one say? So he mixed\r\nthe foaming suds and dabbled in them up to his elbows, and when his\r\nsister witnessed the general frolic into which his leadership suddenly\r\ntransformed the dishwashing she no longer objected. The center of an\r\nadmiring group of youngsters Uncle Frederick scrubbed pots and pans\r\nuntil they shone like mirrors, and all to a chain of the most wonderful\r\nstories.\r\n\r\nWhat marvel that there were quarrels as to who should help him and\r\nactual bribes offered for the coveted pleasure? The children\'s chatter\r\nnever tired him. On the contrary he was in his element when they\r\nswarmed about his chair and perched on his knee. As for his namesake,\r\nJames Frederick, there was not another such baby to be found in all the\r\nworld, he declared. Often he would sit with the little fellow in his\r\narms, crooning to him fragments of old sea chanties whose refrains were\r\nhaunting to hear. Or he wheeled the baby out with as much pride as if\r\nhe were treading the decks of the _Charlotte_.\r\n\r\nTo see him one would have imagined that he had always lived at Mulberry\r\nCourt. How naturally, for example, he wandered into the market,\r\nbringing back with him mysterious bundles which on being opened\r\ndisclosed lamb chops, sweet potatoes, and oranges. And what a feast big\r\nand little McGregors had when such parcels made their advent in the\r\nkitchen! Or he would venture into the shopping district and appear with\r\nhis pockets bulging with rubbers, mittens, and caps. Oh, there never\r\nwas such an uncle! His purse seemed lined with gold; or if it were not\r\nlined with this precious metal at least the supply of pennies it\r\ncontained was unending.\r\n\r\nAnd not only was there one of these shiny pennies for each child in the\r\nfamily but before long the train of benefactions lengthened until there\r\nwas scarce a boy or girl to be found in all Mulberry Court who did not\r\nhave tucked away in his mitten a golden disc with the shining face of\r\nAbraham Lincoln upon it. So it was that he became uncle not alone to\r\nthe wee McGregors but to the community as well.\r\n\r\nNow of course it followed that such a visitor could not be more than a\r\nshort cycle of hours in the neighborhood without making the\r\nacquaintance of the Harlings, and running in to amuse the shut-ins with\r\nhis tales of foreign lands. For he was a rare story-teller, was Uncle\r\nFrederick. Never was there a better. And with running here and running\r\nthere was it to be wondered at that he found himself as busy if not\r\nbusier than he had been when aboard the _Charlotte_--a very lucky thing\r\ntoo, for he confided that he always got fidgety for his ship if he was\r\nidle when on shore.\r\n\r\nNow he had no chance to become nervous or fretful. Much travel had\r\nrendered it easy for him to establish contacts with persons. In\r\nconsequence all types of human beings interested him and with a charm\r\nquite his own he swept aside the preliminaries and by simple and direct\r\nmethods made straight for the hearts of those he met. He reached them,\r\ntoo--there was no doubt about that. Had he chosen he could have\r\nastounded Mulberry Court with all he knew about Julie O\'Dowd, the\r\nMurphys, and the Sullivans. Why, he even knew all about Davis and\r\nCoulter\'s mills before he had been in Baileyville twenty-four hours!\r\n\r\nNow this delightful relative could not but increase in the community\r\nthe prestige of the McGregor family. To have a connection so popular,\r\ntraveled, and prosperous--a man of rank, and adorned with brass\r\nbuttons, what a luster all this shed over the inhabitants of the fifth\r\nfloor of Mulberry Court! Carl, Mary, Tim, Martin, were no longer rated\r\nas little street Arabs; suddenly they became the nieces, nephews\r\n(probably the heirs) of Captain James Frederick Dillingham who\r\ncommanded the _Charlotte_ and had sailed to every port under the sun.\r\nHow the neighbors gossiped, congratulating themselves that they had\r\ndiscovered Mrs. McGregor\'s virtues in time to be included in her circle\r\nof acquaintances! Oh, they had always known she was a lady! Wasn\'t her\r\nancestry stamped upon her very face?\r\n\r\nAs for the Captain himself, his career, when contrasted with the\r\nhumdrum life of Mulberry Court, was like that of a returned Columbus.\r\nHow could he fail to be enveloped in a halo of fascination? For\r\nMulberry Court was dingy and dull. Probably not one of its toiling\r\nthrong was destined ever to see much beyond the city\'s muddy streets,\r\ncrowded sidewalks, cheap shops, and seething tenements. But at least,\r\neven right here in Baileyville, it was possible to glimpse through\r\nother eyes the wonders denied them.\r\n\r\nTherefore when Captain Dillingham came to call one did the next best\r\nthing to really going to India--one went there by proxy and saw in\r\nimagination white-turbaned natives, resplendent temples, sun-flooded\r\ntropics arched by turquoise skies. Even the Murphys could do that, and\r\nwithout it costing them a cent, either. The Captain told Julie O\'Dowd\r\nstories of China while she ironed Joey\'s dresses, and the tediousness\r\nof the task was forgotten in the enchantment of the tale. As for\r\nGrandfather Harling, after the stranger\'s first visit he strained his\r\nears for a second, and when with a cheery "Ahoy!" the knob turned and\r\nthe small gray man entered, it seemed as if the very sunlight came with\r\nhim. And Mrs. Harling welcomed his coming too for even the men\'s talk\r\nof cargoes, commerce, shipping, and stevedores had its lure for her.\r\n\r\nIn fact, all the neighborhood agreed that the dapper little captain\r\n"had a way with him."\r\n\r\n"Why, he could actually talk about dried codfish, I do believe, and\r\nmake you think there was nothing on earth like it!" exclaimed Julie\r\nO\'Dowd to Mrs. Murphy. "I never saw such a man! And so kind withal.\r\nSimple as a child, too. You don\'t catch him prating about his doings.\r\nWhy, Mike Sullivan who went once to New York talked more about it than\r\ndoes this critter all his circlings of the globe."\r\n\r\nAye, the Captain was modest. Everybody agreed to that. Nevertheless he\r\ncertainly had at his tongue\'s end an astonishing amount of information\r\nwhich came hither when occasion arose for him to use it.\r\n\r\nCarl had an illustration of that one day when he chanced to drop a\r\nremark about the Tartary lamb.\r\n\r\n"Tartary lamb, eh!" commented his uncle, catching up the phrase\r\nquickly. "And how, pray, did you hear of the Tartary lamb?"\r\n\r\n"Mother told us."\r\n\r\n"A funny idea, wasn\'t it?" Uncle Frederick spoke as if Tartary lambs\r\nwere topics of everyday conversation. "And yet no stranger than some of\r\nthe notions we hold now, I imagine. We do not know all there is to be\r\nknown ourselves--not by a good sight--even though we do think ourselves\r\nvery up-to-date. With all the learning the ages have rolled up handed\r\nto us in a bundle we should blush were we not better informed than poor\r\nSir John Mandeville, who had no books to speak of. Had he been able to\r\nread Herodotus, for example, he would then have learned from that Greek\r\nwriter who lived so many centuries ago that there was in India a wild\r\ntree having for its fruit fleeces finer than those of sheep; and that\r\nthe natives spun cloth out of them and made clothing for themselves.\r\nHerodotus tells many other interesting facts about cotton and its uses,\r\ntoo. A present, he remarks, sent to the king of Egypt, was packed in\r\ncotton so that it would not get broken. That sounds natural, doesn\'t\r\nit? He even makes our clever inventor, Eli Whitney, appear unoriginal\r\nby describing a Greek machine that separated cotton seeds from the\r\nfiber."\r\n\r\n"Then the cotton gin wasn\'t new, after all," frowned Carl.\r\n\r\n"The idea of it was not new, no; but the device Whitney and his friend\r\nMr. Miller produced was a fresh method for getting this age-old result.\r\nUp to 1760 the same primitive ginning machine was used in England as\r\nhad been used in India for many, many years. Think of that! But as\r\ncivilization grew and people not only wove more cloth but made an\r\nincreasing variety of kinds the demand for material to make it\r\nincreased. And old Herodotus is by no means the only early historian to\r\nmention cotton. Other writers went into even more details than he,\r\ndescribing the plant, its leaves and blossoms, and telling how it was\r\nset out in rows. Apparently as long ago as 519 B.C. the Persians were\r\nspinning and weaving cloth and dyeing it all sorts of colors, using for\r\nthe purpose the leaves and roots of tropical plants. It therefore\r\nfollowed that when the officers of Emperor Alexander\'s army returned\r\nfrom the East they brought back to Greece tales of the cotton plant,\r\nand Greeks and Romans alike began to use the material for awnings much\r\nas we do now."\r\n\r\n"How funny!" smiled Carl. "I\'ll bet they were glad to have something to\r\nshade them from the sun. I shouldn\'t relish spending the summer in\r\nGreece or Italy."\r\n\r\n"I guess you wouldn\'t. Baileyville may be hot in July but it is nothing\r\nto what Rome must have been. The stone seats of the Forum were like\r\nstove covers; and because the rich old Romans enjoyed comfort quite as\r\nmuch as anybody else, lengths of cotton cloth were stretched across\r\ncertain parts of the structure to shade it. Even your friend Julius\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar was not so toughened by battle that he fancied having the hot sun\r\nbeat down on his head; he therefore ordered a screening of cloth to be\r\nextended from the top of his house to that of the Capitoline Hill so\r\nwhen he rode hither he could be cool and sheltered. Oh, the Romans knew\r\na good thing when they saw it--never fear! In the meantime Greeks and\r\nRomans alike were using the newly discovered material for tents, sails,\r\nand gay-colored coverlets."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t cotton grow in any other country beside India, Uncle\r\nFrederick?" interrogated Mary.\r\n\r\n"We do not really know about that," was her uncle\'s reply. "Certainly\r\nit was found in other places--Egypt, Africa, Mexico, and America; but\r\nwhether it was native to these lands or had been transplanted to them\r\nit is impossible to say. We do know, however, that the ancient\r\nEgyptians depended chiefly on flax for their cloth and imported cotton\r\nfrom other countries, so although the plant did grow there they could\r\nnot have had much of it. The little they had was cultivated, I believe,\r\nalmost entirely as a shrub and used merely for decoration."\r\n\r\n"But loads of cotton come from Egypt now," declared Carl. "The teacher\r\ntold us so."\r\n\r\n"Indeed it does," nodded Captain Dillingham. "I have brought many a\r\nbale of it back in my ship, so I know."\r\n\r\n"Really!" ejaculated his listeners.\r\n\r\n"Yes; Egypt, India, and the United States are the great\r\ncotton-producing countries of the world. India comes first on the list;\r\nthen we ourselves, with our vast southern crops; then Egypt. And it is\r\nbecause India raises such great quantities of cotton and is obliged to\r\nship it to England for manufacture afterward buying it back again--that\r\nGandhi and his followers who are eager for India to be independent of\r\nEngland are raising little patches of cotton, weaving their own cloth\r\non hand looms, and refusing to purchase that of English make. It\r\ncertainly seems fair enough that the wealth derived from this crop\r\nshould remain in India and not be spent for things the people of India\r\ndo not like. However, all that is too big a question for you and me."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see cotton growing, Uncle Frederick?" asked Tim, who had\r\ndrawn near.\r\n\r\n"Oh, often, sonny. As a general thing the plant is like a Christmas\r\ntree in shape. The perennial plants, or those that come up every year,\r\nfrequently grow to be six or eight feet tall; but the annual ones\r\nremain little three or four-foot bushes. Still each grows into pyramid\r\nform, having the wider branches at the bottom. The leaves are not\r\nunlike the lilac; and there is a deep, cup-shaped pod having points\r\nthat turn up like fingers and hold the cotton in tightly. But no matter\r\nwhether perennial or annual, the cotton plant must have a hot, humid\r\nclimate to thrive, and if the land is not naturally moist it must be\r\nirrigated as it is in Egypt."\r\n\r\n"I thought things like cotton just grew wild, Uncle Frederick," said\r\nTim.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," laughed his uncle. "You cannot gather big crops of\r\nanything unless you are willing to work for them. The Lord does not\r\nmean to make life too easy for us. He gives us all these things and\r\nthen He has done His part; we must do the rest. The world is a place of\r\nopportunities, that is all. If we are too lazy to take them, or too\r\nstupid, it is our own fault. Many a man gets nowhere because he fails\r\nto grasp this idea. So, sonny, you do not get your cotton all grown for\r\nyou, and with the seeds picked out. You are given the root and if you\r\nwish a big cotton crop you must plant seeds, or better yet set out\r\ncuttings, cultivate and care for the plants. Every minute your mind\r\nmust be on the thing you are trying to raise. You must watch, for\r\ninstance, for pests of insects; diseases that will spoil your plants;\r\nblights caused by fungi; and above all for sudden changes in the\r\nweather. Should it turn scorching hot just when your cotton shoots are\r\nup and beginning to spread their roots the result will be fatal. Or an\r\nearly frost will work ruin. Sometimes, you know, we have a spell of hot\r\nweather in the late winter that fools the growing things into thinking\r\nspring has come, and the poor misguided plants begin to put out their\r\nleaves. Then, like a mischievous joker, old Winter comes back and nips\r\nthe trusting little creatures. Cotton doesn\'t fancy that sort of joke.\r\nNor does it like too much wet weather, for then the cotton gets damp\r\nand sodden and cannot be picked. Should it be gathered in this\r\ncondition it would mold and mildew, and become a wreck."\r\n\r\n"It sounds to me as if cotton raising was pretty hard work," sighed\r\nTim.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no harder than are most other things, Timmie," returned Uncle\r\nFrederick. "Generally speaking cotton plants sail along safely enough\r\nunless a pest attacks them. That is their greatest menace. When a pest\r\ndescends on the crop the grower does lose courage, I can tell you. It\r\nis queer to think what damage a crowd of tiny insects can do, isn\'t it?\r\nSome of them will bore through the pods as if in pure spite and spoil\r\nthe cotton fiber at the time it is just beginning to form--a detestable\r\ntrick! Others, fattening on the tender green leaves near the top of the\r\nplant, will turn into caterpillars, creep down the stalk, and devour\r\nevery leaf as they go along. This leaves the roots of the plant\r\nunprotected from the sun and speedily every particle of moisture on\r\nwhich the growth is so dependent is dried up. So the plants shrivel and\r\ndie. Then there are beetles, locusts, grasshoppers, and all the rest of\r\nthe army of trouble-makers who wait to steal a march on the unwatchful\r\nplanter. All these rebels must be kept their distance if you would\r\nharvest a big cotton crop."\r\n\r\n"I guess I never would have any cotton," remarked the disheartened Tim.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you would, son," laughed his uncle. "Surely you wouldn\'t let\r\nyourself be beaten by a lot of bugs and worms, would you? Should you\r\nlive in a climate where cotton could be raised you would pitch in,\r\nfight the pests, and be as proud of your snowy field as many another\r\nman is. For when the pods are ready for gathering there is no prettier\r\nsight. It is like a huge bowl of popcorn."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to see a cotton field," ventured Mary.\r\n\r\n"You\'d have to go to India, the southern part of your own country,\r\nAustralia, Brazil, Egypt, or the South Sea Islands then," Captain\r\nDillingham responded. "That is, if you wanted to see the best of\r\nit--that which is strongest of fiber."\r\n\r\n"But isn\'t cotton all alike?" queried the girl, with parted lips.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, child! There are many different kinds of cotton. Some have\r\nseeds of one color, some of another; some seeds come out easily, some\r\ndo not; some cotton is strong fibered, some is weak and snaps at a\r\ntouch; some has long fibers and some short. Each variety has its name\r\nand is peculiar to a given country."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" came in chorus from his audience.\r\n\r\n"For instance, the most delicate or fine quality of thread is produced\r\nfrom the Sea Island cotton, and usually this type is quite expensive;\r\nit has so many seeds and they take up so much room in the pod that\r\nafter they have been removed only a small quantity of cotton remains\r\nand that makes it costly. Almost every other kind gives more lint (or\r\npicked cotton) than does this variety. The Egyptian cotton is somewhat\r\non this same order. India, China, Arabia, Persia, Asia Minor, Africa,\r\nand the Coromandel Coast all have a common type of plant which probably\r\nfirst grew in the latter place and was transplanted from there to the\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n"In Cuba a sort of cotton vine is found that has very large pods and a\r\ngreat number of seeds. Some of the fibers of this plant are long and\r\nsome short. It is not a very good kind of cotton to cultivate because\r\nthe long fibers get tangled up with the seeds and often break when\r\nbeing separated. Moreover the short fibers are all mixed in with the\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n"This gives you some notion of the different species of cotton. Were I\r\nto tell you of all the kinds you would be tired hearing about them. I\r\nmyself get interested because I carry so much cotton in my ship--bales\r\nupon bales of it. Sometimes I take cotton out from America to countries\r\nthat either do not have any, or do not have as much as they want;\r\nsometimes I bring back here varieties that we cannot raise in the\r\nSouth."\r\n\r\n"What kind of cotton do we raise in the United States?" Mary asked.\r\n\r\n"The bulk of our cotton is long-stapled and is called Georgian Upland,"\r\nwas the response. "The whole plant is rough and hairy--leaf, branch,\r\nand pod. Some persons think that originally it came from Mexico.\r\nHowever that may be, here it is, and although we raise some little of\r\nother sorts we have far more of this than anything else. We can thank\r\nit, too, for much of the wealth of this country of ours for Texas,\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, North and South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana and\r\nArkansas are all big cotton-growing States. Florida, Tennessee, Indian\r\nTerritory, Missouri, Virginia, Kentucky, Kansas, and Oklahoma also lie\r\nin the cotton belt and ship substantial crops."\r\n\r\nThe little man rose.\r\n\r\n"I could go on talking cotton forever," jested he. "Think of a sacred\r\ncotton tree often as high as twenty feet, growing along the coast of\r\nthe Indian Ocean, the cotton from which is used only for weaving cloth\r\nfor the turbans of Hindoo priests! And think of still another\r\nexquisitely fine Indian cotton called Dacca cotton that is spun and\r\nwoven into fragile oriental muslins and Madras Long Cloth. It almost\r\nmakes your mouth water to grow cotton, doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, at least you can go and see it grown, Uncle Frederick, and that\r\nis more than we can do," piped Tim.\r\n\r\n"True, sonny," nodded the captain. "But still you who stay at home and\r\ndo not see it grown have your share in its benefits. You wear, use, and\r\neat cotton products."\r\n\r\n"How?" questioned the wondering Tim.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you have cotton cloth for clothing, bedding, and no end of other\r\ncomforts? Of course you do."\r\n\r\n"But--eating cotton----" faltered Tim. "I don\'t do that."\r\n\r\n"There are medicines made from the cotton root; cottonseed oil for\r\ncooking and to use on salads, you may not be aware, comes from the\r\nmeaty kernel inside the cotton seed."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know that," Tim answered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, cotton has many by-products," returned his uncle. "The lint that\r\ncannot be used for spinning is made into cotton wadding to pad quilts,\r\nskirts, and coat linings; and cotton waste is excellent for cleaning\r\nmachinery. Ripe cotton fiber furnishes an almost pure cellulose, too."\r\n\r\n"Cotton certainly seems to do its part in the world," Mary murmured\r\nthoughtfully. "But I\'m not sure," added she, with a mischievous little\r\nsmile, "that I know just what cellulose is."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nNORTH AND SOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\n"Where do you and the _Charlotte_ go when you leave here, Frederick?"\r\nhis sister inquired as the family sat at breakfast the next morning.\r\n\r\n"New Orleans, I suppose; we touch there for a cargo of cotton," was the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll see the crop gathered, won\'t you, Uncle Frederick?" Mary\r\nput in.\r\n\r\n"Hardly that, lassie," replied her uncle kindly. "All the work will be\r\ndone before I arrive. However, I shall not mind that for I have seen\r\nsouthern cotton fields in their prime before now."\r\n\r\n"It grows everywhere in the South, doesn\'t it?" Mary ventured.\r\n\r\n"One could hardly say that, my dear," Captain Dillingham responded with\r\na mild shake of his head. "On the contrary the cotton belt of the\r\nUnited States is comparatively small considering the vast crops it\r\nyields."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t they make it bigger and plant more cotton?" questioned Tim.\r\n\r\n"Cotton, as I told you, sonny, has its own ideas as to where it will\r\ngrow. Let it be planted farther north than forty-five degrees and it\r\nwill only thrive under glass; or try to cultivate it farther south than\r\nthe thirty-five degree line and it will also balk. This, you see,\r\nleaves a rather narrow zone that answers its demands in the way of\r\ntemperature and soil. For the kind of soil cotton likes has to be\r\nconsidered also. If the land is too sandy the moisture will soon dry up\r\nand the plants shrivel; or if there is an undue proportion of clay the\r\nexcess moisture will not drain off and the plants will run to wood and\r\nleaves. Therefore you have the problem of getting the right proportions\r\nof clay, loam and sand in a climate where the temperature holds\r\npractically even."\r\n\r\n"Why, I shouldn\'t think any spot on earth would fill that bill,"\r\ngrinned Carl.\r\n\r\n"We do succeed in getting just such areas, however," returned Captain\r\nDillingham. "North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana,\r\nTexas, Arkansas, Florida, Tennessee, Indian Territory, Missouri,\r\nVirginia, Kentucky, Kansas, and Oklahoma all contrive to answer the\r\nrequirements to a greater or less degree. These States boast soils that\r\nare blends of clay, sand, and loam in the desired proportions; and\r\nwhile some of them are better than others both soil and temperature are\r\nsuch that cotton can be grown in them. Given these two assets the rest\r\nof the conundrum is up to the planter."\r\n\r\n"I should think most of it was answered for him when he has these two\r\nimportant factors," Mrs. McGregor asserted.\r\n\r\n"But to have climate and land is not enough," protested her brother.\r\n"Once he possesses the land the owner must take care of it. It cannot\r\nbe allowed to run out but must be plowed up, fertilized, and the crop\r\ntended like any other farm product. Before cotton growers realized\r\nthis, not much attention was paid to these laws and in consequence the\r\ncrop of many a southern plantation suffered. Now cotton-raising is done\r\nfar more scientifically. The old stalks are gathered and destroyed; the\r\nland is plowed and fertilized, and afterward seed-planting machines go\r\nup and down the rows, scattering five or six seeds into each hole, with\r\na space of not more than a foot between the holes. Then the seeds are\r\ncovered over lightly and left to sprout."\r\n\r\n"How long is it before they come up?" interrogated Carl.\r\n\r\n"About ten or twelve days," was the reply. "A couple of days later the\r\nfirst leaf appears and then trouble begins. April sees the Carolina\r\nplanters thinning their shoots in order to have sturdy plants from\r\nwhich to select the ones eventually allowed to grow. States farther\r\nsouth get at the task earlier. After the thinning process is over the\r\nplants are hilled up like potatoes and the spaces between the rows,\r\nwhere the last season\'s crop previously grew, is plowed to keep the\r\nsoil open and free for drainage. Men afterward travel through the open\r\nrows hoeing up the loose soil and heaping it around the young plants to\r\nstrengthen and protect them; then, since nothing more can be done\r\nimmediately everybody takes a rest and waits."\r\n\r\n"Then what happens?" piped Tim.\r\n\r\n"Oh, after a time the same process is repeated. The earth by this time\r\nhas become crusted over and must be opened up again; the hauling, too,\r\ntakes place once more. Hauling is the name given to bedding up the\r\nplants with loose earth. Often there are four or five _haulings_. By\r\nJuly the plants have grown sufficiently to show which one in each hill\r\nis to be the most thrifty and this one is left to grow while the other\r\nshoots are pulled up. After that, given sunny days and occasional light\r\nshowers, the crop should prosper. Should there, however, be too much\r\nheat, or too great a quantity of rain, things will not move so\r\nsuccessfully."\r\n\r\n"How long does cotton have to grow before it is ready for picking?"\r\nasked Carl.\r\n\r\n"The plants bloom approximately the middle of June--sometimes earlier,\r\nsometimes later, according to the climates of the various States. Two\r\nmonths after that the crop is ready to be gathered. You must not,\r\nhowever, run away with the notion that cotton-picking is a hurried\r\nprocess. Often it goes on from the end of August until into November or\r\nDecember. It is a long-drawn-out, tedious, monotonous task. Whole\r\nfamilies join in the harvesting for since there is always some low and\r\nsome tall cotton (some annual and some perennial varieties) the\r\nchildren can share with their elders in the work and thus earn quite a\r\nsum of money. In fact, in the old days before child labor laws\r\nprotected the kiddies, and while cotton-picking was done by slaves,\r\nmany a poor little mite toiled cruelly long in the fields. Even the\r\nolder negroes were driven with whips and compelled to keep at work\r\nuntil utterly exhausted."\r\n\r\nHis audience gasped.\r\n\r\n"Yes," nodded their uncle, "I am afraid that urged forward by the\r\ndesire to garner a big crop before rain should fall and spoil it, the\r\ncotton growers practiced much cruelty. No doubt, too, the same tyranny\r\nreigned in India. Wherever work must be done by hand and labor is cheap\r\nand plentiful, human beings come to be classed to a great extent as\r\nmachines. Plantation owners become so interested in the money they are\r\nto make that they forget everything else. Of course labor was never as\r\ncheap in our Southern States even during slave days as in India and\r\ntherefore until the advent of the cotton gin cotton was not one of our\r\nvaluable crops."\r\n\r\n"You mean because the seeds had to be picked out by hand?" Carl said.\r\n\r\n"Yes. There was, to be sure, the primitive kind of gin resorted to in\r\nIndia for cleaning certain black-seed varieties. Two kinds of this\r\nblack-seed, or long-stapled cotton, grew in the Sea Islands and along\r\nthe coast from Delaware to Georgia; but it could not be made to thrive\r\naway from the moist ocean climate. Hence on inland plantations a\r\ndifferent and more vigorous variety of plant (one having green seeds\r\nand short staples) was propagated. This kind was known as Upland\r\ncotton. It was a troublesome product for the planters, I assure you,\r\nfor its many seeds clung so tightly to the lint that it was almost out\r\nof the question to remove them. The simple little gin copied from India\r\nand successfully used on the black seed variety was entirely\r\nimpracticable on this Upland growth since it tore the fibers all to\r\nbits."\r\n\r\n"They did need a cotton gin, didn\'t they!" Carl ejaculated.\r\n\r\n"Very badly, indeed," agreed Captain Dillingham. "Well, the only\r\nsubstitute for machinery was fingers; and when I tell you that it often\r\ntook an entire day to get out of a three-pound batch of cotton a pound\r\nor so that was clear of seeds you will understand what a slow process\r\nit was."\r\n\r\n"At that rate I shouldn\'t think it would have paid anybody to raise\r\ncotton," sniffed Carl.\r\n\r\n"It didn\'t," returned his uncle. "Moreover it rendered the product very\r\nexpensive, for it required a great number of slaves to clean any\r\nconsiderable quantity of cotton. I often think of the toil and misery\r\nthat went into the cotton-growing of those slavery days. After working\r\nfor a long stretch of hours in the blazing sun the negroes came in at\r\nnight worn out. But were they allowed to rest? Perhaps some of them who\r\nhad considerate owners were; but many, many others less fortunate were\r\nset to picking out seeds and lest they fall asleep at their task\r\noverseers prodded them with whips."\r\n\r\n"Gee!"\r\n\r\n"That was slavery, son," declared Captain Dillingham. "Do you wonder\r\nthat Abraham Lincoln thought it would be worth even a war to rid this\r\ncountry of such an evil? Understand, I am not condemning all slave\r\nowners. Undoubtedly there were kind and humane ones just as there are\r\nto this day employers who are fair with their help. But urged on by\r\ncommercial greed the temptation of the planters was to force the slaves\r\nto do more than was right, and as a result a great deal of cruelty was\r\npracticed. Had the primitive method of picking cotton by hand continued\r\nit is probable that slavery might have died a natural death without\r\nrecourse to war, for many of the Southerners were reaching a point\r\nwhere the returns from cotton and tobacco were not sufficient to feed\r\nthe army of slaves that swarmed over the plantations. To use a common\r\nphrase the slaves were eating their heads off. It was just at this\r\njuncture, however, that Eli Whitney came along with his cotton gin and\r\nin a twinkling the South became revolutionized and the problem of the\r\nlegion of idle, profitless slaves was settled. They would now be idle\r\nand profitless no longer. Vast quantities of cotton could henceforth be\r\nplanted and the negroes could cultivate and gather it. With Eli\r\nWhitney\'s gin to do the slow and hindering part of the process\r\ncotton-raising could be made a paying industry."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Whitney bobbed up in the very nick of time, didn\'t he?" smiled\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n"For the financial prosperity of the South he did," her uncle\r\nresponded. "But to the welfare of the negroes his advent was a fatal\r\nstroke. Slaves immediately were more in demand than they ever had been\r\nbefore. No mechanical device could take their place. Cotton must be\r\nplanted, cultivated, and harvested by hand and the larger the cotton\r\nfields became, the harder the slaves were worked. The cotton crop\r\nbecame the staple product of the South. Many a Southerner who took up\r\narms against the Union did so because he honestly believed that to free\r\nthe slaves would mean the economic ruin of his section of the country."\r\n\r\n"I never thought of that side of the question before," Mrs. McGregor\r\nmurmured thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Nor I," rejoined Carl.\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless it is a fact none of us here in the North should forget,"\r\ncontinued Captain Dillingham. "To the southern planter our point of\r\nview appeared unfair and grossly one-sided. It was easy enough for the\r\nNorth to say the slaves should be freed. They had no cotton fields and\r\ntheir prosperity was not dependent on the negroes. But to let the\r\nslaves go meant ruin for the South. It was not alone, you see, that\r\ntheir owners wished the profit derived from buying and selling them;\r\nthey needed them to work. Never had the South had such an opportunity\r\nto coin wealth as that now opening. What wonder its residents were\r\nangry at having this dazzling prospect for fortune-making snatched\r\naway? Remember and take these facts into consideration when you think\r\nharshly of those who took up arms to defend slavery."\r\n\r\nThere was an instant\'s pause.\r\n\r\n"Of course, however, none of this justifies slavery or makes it more\r\nright. The entire principle of it was wrong; it was un-Christian,\r\nunjust, and cruel, and the only honorable thing to do was to bring it\r\nto an end in this country. But that is another story altogether. What\r\nwe are talking about now is the cotton itself; and to get a big view of\r\nthis subject it is well to consider what was happening in the world\r\njust at this time, and why cotton was such a desirable commodity.\r\n\r\n"Over across the ocean James Watts\'s steam engine, combined with the\r\nflying shuttle of John Kay, the spinning jenny of Hargreaves, the\r\nwater-frame of Arkwright, and the self-acting loom of Crompton, was\r\nworking as great a revolution in England\'s cloth-making industry as Eli\r\nWhitney\'s cotton gin had done in the South. In other words the hand\r\nloom had been supplanted by the more modern device of the steam-driven\r\nspinning mill. This meant that in future cloth would no longer be made\r\nin small quantities in the homes, women of the families spinning the\r\nthread and weaving it whenever they could steal a bit of time from\r\nother household duties. No! Cloth was to be made in factories on a much\r\nlarger scale, and sold to the public."\r\n\r\n"No wonder the fact set everybody to raising cotton!" declared Mrs.\r\nMcGregor.\r\n\r\n"No wonder indeed!" nodded her brother. "From a vintage so small that\r\neven President Jefferson scarcely knew America had a cotton crop at all\r\nthis product of the South leaped forward by bounds. The year preceding\r\nEli Whitney\'s invention the United States exported less than one\r\nhundred and forty thousand bales; but the year afterward the shipment\r\nhad soared to nearly half a million. The following year it was a\r\nmillion and a half; the year after that six million."\r\n\r\n"Gee whizz!" commented Carl. "That was some record, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Rather!" agreed his uncle.\r\n\r\n"How much do we export now, Uncle Frederick?" Mary asked.\r\n\r\n"From nine to twelve million bales of five-hundred pounds each are\r\nraised annually in the South," returned Captain Dillingham. "Of this\r\nabout ninety per cent. is Upland cotton, the green seeds of which have\r\nto be taken out by a gin similar to the one Eli Whitney invented.\r\nApproximately about half this vast crop is exported."\r\n\r\n"I had no idea we raised so much cotton," mused Carl.\r\n\r\n"We raise quantities of it, son," Uncle Frederick said. "Now you can\r\nunderstand better why the South was so resentful at being compelled to\r\nfree the slaves. With cotton so much in demand the prices of slaves had\r\ngreatly increased. The planters had untold wealth almost within their\r\ngrasp. It was all very well for the North to assert that slavery was a\r\nbarbarous practise. Who was to tend the cotton fields when the slaves\r\nwere gone?"\r\n\r\n"The South did have something on its side, didn\'t it?" Mary ventured.\r\n\r\n"A great deal, when once you put yourself in the Southerner\'s place. We\r\nin the North are liable to emphasize only the cruelty of slavery and\r\nare often unable to understand how enlightened and Christian men could\r\nkeep slaves and fight to keep them. You see there were reasons."\r\n\r\nMary nodded.\r\n\r\n"Of course, as I said before, all the cotton-raising in the world could\r\nnot make the thing right. It was wrong from start to finish.\r\nNevertheless it does explain why some of our people felt the freeing of\r\nthe slaves so unjust and such a blow to their prosperity that they\r\nthreatened secession from the Union."\r\n\r\n"And it was because Abraham Lincoln would not allow them to secede that\r\nthe war was fought!" announced Carl triumphantly.\r\n\r\n"Precisely! You cannot allow part of a country to rise up and walk out\r\nany more than you can let some of the wheels of a watch announce they\r\nare not going to turn any more," laughed his uncle. "It requires every\r\npart to make the watch go; and it takes the united strength of a people\r\nto make a nation. North and South were all beloved children of one\r\nland, and Abraham Lincoln, like the father of a big family, was not\r\ngoing to let any of the household break away from the organization to\r\nwhich it belonged. It meant a struggle to do the two things\r\nnecessary--free the slaves and preserve the Union; but quarrels are\r\nsometimes necessary in families. After they are over there is a more\r\nperfect understanding. So it has been with this one. Both sides paid a\r\nfearful price but as a result we now have _one nation, indivisible,\r\nwith liberty and justice for all_."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the oath of allegiance!" cried Carl, Mary, and Tim in chorus,\r\nas they leaped to their feet and stood at salute.\r\n\r\n"We say it at school every morning," continued Tim, "but I never knew\r\nbefore what it meant."\r\n\r\n"You will know better now, won\'t you?" Captain Dillingham replied.\r\n"Every time you say those words remember the brave men of the South who\r\nreally believed they had a right to establish a government of their own\r\nand protect the prosperity of their part of this great land. If you do\r\nthis you will learn to honor both sides alike, each of which fought so\r\ndevotedly for the cause he cherished. And now that the war is over the\r\nentire country has the South to thank for one of its greatest sources\r\nof wealth--cotton. The South raises it; the North, with its many mills,\r\ntransforms the raw product into a finished commodity. How is that for\r\nteam work? Could there be better proof of how vitally each section\r\nneeds the other?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nA LESSON IN THRIFT\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening Carl resumed the cotton-raising subject by idly remarking,\r\n"I suppose since the invention of the cotton gin and the abolition of\r\nslavery most of the drudgery connected with the cotton industry has\r\ndisappeared."\r\n\r\nHis uncle smiled.\r\n\r\n"Hardly that, I am afraid, sonny," replied he. "Even under the best\r\npossible conditions the cultivation and gathering of the cotton crop\r\nentails drudgery. This cannot be helped. In the first place cotton\r\ndemands steady heat to make it grow; and you know what it means to work\r\nall day in the broiling sun. Of course the negroes are to a certain\r\ndegree accustomed to this; and moreover they belong to a race that\r\nfinds hot weather less hard to bear than do many other persons.\r\nNevertheless heat is heat, and say what you may, a hot sun pouring down\r\non one\'s head does not make for comfort. In addition there is the\r\nmonotony of the harvesting. As I told you before, this has to be done\r\nby hand--there is no escape from that; and since it must be, the\r\ndullness of the task is an unavoidable evil."\r\n\r\nCarl mused thoughtfully for a moment.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see," observed he presently, "that after all the negroes are\r\nmuch better off than they were in slave days."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, they are," Captain Dillingham instantly responded. "Remember\r\nthey now receive wages; their hours of work have also been shortened\r\nand regulated; and overseers have become more humane and now invent\r\nlittle ways of breaking the monotony and making the time pass more\r\npleasantly."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, there are various things that can be done to achieve this end.\r\nSometimes fresh buttermilk or some other refreshing drink is passed\r\ndown the rows; or on a cool day hot coffee is served. Any little change\r\nsuch as singing or whistling interrupts the sleepy effect of one\r\ncontinual process and shifts the mood and spirits of those toiling into\r\nanother groove. This is very beneficial. All our students of industrial\r\nmethods will tell you that the worst flaw of our present system is the\r\neffect monotony has on the minds of those constantly subjected to it.\r\nPerforming without deviation the same mechanical act day after day\r\ndeadens the brain and even, in certain cases, produces insanity. It\r\nalso kills ambition and creates hopeless, indifferent persons.\r\nTherefore, made wiser by psychology we realize the importance of\r\nstirring the mind out of a fixed rut, or rather a stupidity that verges\r\non somnambulism, and keeping it alert and active. Sheep growers, for\r\nexample, try in every way to divert the minds of their shepherds lest\r\nthe continual watching of a slowly moving flock paralyze their minds\r\nand get them _locoed_."\r\n\r\n"Really?"\r\n\r\n"Your mother will tell you that. That is why a shepherd\'s pipe is such\r\na splendid thing. To pick out a tune and listen to it starts the mind\r\nout of its trance and promotes mental exercise. It does what gymnastics\r\ndo for the body."\r\n\r\n"But all our factories keep men at a single task," Carl objected.\r\n\r\n"You mean the piece-work system? Aye, I know," nodded his uncle. "And\r\nas we grow wiser, and come to care more for our fellows, we begin to\r\nwonder whether so much specializing is as fine a notion as we at first\r\nthought it. It makes for efficiency, for without question a man who\r\ndoes just one thing over and over becomes expert at his particular job;\r\nbut does he not in time, because of his very expertness, lapse into a\r\nmachine whose hands move automatically and whose mind is idle? Such a\r\nresult is fatal both to his intellect and his will. He becomes passive\r\nuntil at length all initiative is destroyed. For many years the colored\r\npeople of the South reaped precisely this harvest of mental inertia.\r\nNow, thank heaven, they are rousing out of the lethargy that has been\r\ntheir inheritance and their brains are getting to work. It will,\r\nhowever, take years, perhaps generations, for some of them to work up\r\nto a normal mental activity and intelligence; but if they persist\r\nresults will surely come. Many of them have already shaken off their\r\nintellectual fetters so that not only are their bodies free but their\r\nminds are also. That is why I feel that all our citizens should do\r\neverything in their power to help them, and try and make up to them for\r\nthe injustices they have suffered. It is not enough to take them out of\r\nphysical slavery; we should break the chains of their mental\r\nimprisonment as well by giving them schools, trades, and such other\r\ntraining as is within their mental scope."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I never thought of the negroes that way," confessed Carl.\r\n\r\n"A great many persons older than you do not," Captain Dillingham\r\nreturned kindly. "But when you do think of them from that angle you\r\ncannot but honor the more highly those colored persons who have\r\nachieved positions of importance. There are now in our country colored\r\nlawyers, doctors, teachers, poets, and writers. Who can tell what their\r\nbackground has been or measure the mental exertion that has brought\r\nthem where they are to-day? Wherever we meet them we should give them a\r\nhand up. We owe it to them because of our own greater opportunity."\r\n\r\nThe little man stopped to light his pipe.\r\n\r\n"Now see where talking about picking cotton has led me," grumbled he\r\nwhimsically. "A pretty distance I\'ve wandered from my subject! Well,\r\nyou mustn\'t touch me off on the topic of the colored race again. I have\r\nseen many abuses of the negroes in my day, both on shipboard and\r\nashore, and the subject turns me hot. Just how the evils of\r\ncotton-gathering are to be avoided I do not know. We must wait, I fear,\r\nuntil some clever individual bobs up with a scheme that does away with\r\nhand harvesting of cotton. In the meantime the only remedy left us is\r\nto vary the work of the men and women who toil at it as much as is\r\npossible."\r\n\r\n"I wish, Uncle Frederick, you would tell us just how the cotton is\r\ngathered," said Mary, who had joined the group.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dillingham flashed the girl one of his rare smiles.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, my dear, just how much more there is to tell," declared\r\nhe. "Of course, if you have ever picked currants or blackberries you\r\nwill realize something of the constant bending and stooping that goes\r\nwith the industry and will understand how hard it is on the back. Then\r\nthere is the continual standing, a tiresome business at best. Besides,\r\nmechanically as the task is rated, it is not such an easy one after\r\nall, for the cotton fibers stick firmly to the inside of the pods and\r\nas a result the unskilled person who tries to detach them in a hurry\r\nwill probably succeed only in extricating a bare half of what is\r\ninside. And like as not he will break the fibers he does get out so\r\nthat their value will be sadly decreased. The trade has its tricks, you\r\nsee. Furthermore an amateur generally has fragments of husks and leaves\r\nscattered through his cotton, all of which have to be removed and make\r\nextra work later on."\r\n\r\n"Then cotton-gathering is not really such brainless work as it might\r\nbe, is it, Uncle Frederick," Mary asserted.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it requires a knack that comes through practice," conceded her\r\nuncle quickly. "As soon as the pods crack open and show white it is a\r\nsign the workers must be on hand for the picking, and early in the\r\nmorning they assemble that they may have a long day to work while the\r\nsun is on the crop. For as I told you there can be no cotton-harvesting\r\nwithout sun to dry off the night\'s moisture. The moment a bag or basket\r\nis filled it is emptied into something larger and the picker starts\r\nafresh. Before evening comes and the dew falls, the day\'s crop is\r\nhurried under cover that it may not absorb any dampness. Here it is\r\npacked into receptacles banded with the owner\'s name or private mark,\r\nand made ready to be carried to the ginning factory."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t the planters have their own cotton gins?" queried Carl in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "The cotton is sent to factories to be ginned."\r\n_Page_ 129.]\r\n\r\n"Oh no, son! That would be an unnecessary and expensive luxury. Just as\r\ncorn is sent to the miller to be ground, so the cotton is sent to\r\nfactories to be ginned, weighed, and baled for shipment. You see the\r\ncotton grown on any one plantation and cultivated under uniform\r\nconditions will be practically of the same ripeness and weight; it will\r\nalso be, in all probability, of the same variety. This fact is\r\nimportant when ginning and selling it, and greatly increases its value.\r\nSuch conditions, however, do not always prevail for there are districts\r\n(and also countries) where small cotton farms exist whose output is not\r\nlarge enough to make an entire bale. In such cases the product of\r\nseveral farms has to be combined and this makes a bale mixed in\r\nquality. This is true of part of the cotton that comes from India.\r\nThere many of the natives, owing to lack of commercial and industrial\r\nenterprise, raise small batches of cotton. Often it takes a great many\r\nof these little lots to make up a bale."\r\n\r\n"Do the natives of India take the seeds out of their own cotton?" asked\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n"Some of them do, using the primitive gins so long known in India. The\r\nChinese also gin much of their own cotton by amateur gins. But it goes\r\nwithout saying that much of the cotton fiber is broken by these\r\nmethods. For the more perfect the gin the less loss results. Even with\r\nour best machinery however, a certain amount of injury is done which\r\ncannot be avoided."\r\n\r\n"Then Eli Whitney\'s gin isn\'t so perfect," ventured Carl.\r\n\r\n"Its method is as perfect a one as we have," answered Captain\r\nDillingham, "and up to date nothing better has been found. Those\r\nhandling large quantities of cotton are almighty thankful to have\r\nanything as good, I can tell you. In India, China, and oriental\r\ncountries, though, where the lots are small the people, as I say, still\r\ncling to their primitive foot gins. Here in America we have several\r\ntypes of gin all made on the same general principle but differing\r\nslightly as to detail. Some of these are better than others. By this I\r\nmean some are less brutal and cause a smaller degree of waste. Indeed I\r\nbelieve Whitney\'s own gin and those of its kind known as saw gins are\r\nconsidered to do the most damage to the fiber. This sort of gin\r\nconsists of a series of circular saws set into a revolving shaft in\r\nsuch a way that the cotton fed into the machine is separated from its\r\nseeds in an incredibly short space of time. Afterward a whirling brush\r\ncleans the saws of the fiber clinging to them. It is an effectual\r\nsystem but a merciless one and is best adapted to short staple cotton\r\nwhich is strong and does not snarl. The best gins use only long, smooth\r\nblades to clear the cotton and it follows that these do the fiber far\r\nless injury."\r\n\r\n"How does a ginning factory look, Uncle Frederick?" Carl inquired.\r\n\r\n"You mean the inside? I never went through but one. I was waiting for a\r\ncargo at Norfolk once and as there happened to be a ginning plant near\r\nwhere I was staying I visited it. Generally peaking I suppose they are\r\npretty much alike. The cotton is brought to them, as I said, in clearly\r\nmarked, or branded bags or baskets, and is tossed from the wagons\r\ndirectly into hoppers. Afterward the contents of the hoppers is loaded\r\ninto freight elevators and shot to one of the upper stories of the\r\nfactory, there to be piled up and await its turn for ginning.\r\n\r\n"When the time comes to gin that particular batch it is heaped into a\r\nhopper and borne to the gins below by means of traveling racks."\r\n\r\n"How many gins are there to a factory?" questioned Mary.\r\n\r\n"That depends on the size of the factory and the amount of work brought\r\nthere to be done," was the reply. "A fair-sized factory in a busy\r\ndistrict will have half-a-dozen gins or more; and when you know that\r\none gin will clean from three hundred to three hundred and fifty pounds\r\nof cotton an hour you will see that it will take a pretty big supply to\r\nkeep such a lot of machinery moving. There is a separate hopper for\r\neach gin and if the supply fed into it comes too fast it can be stopped\r\nand switched to other gins. Once in the clutch of the relentless knives\r\nthe cotton is shredded apart and the seeds drop out and fall into a\r\ntraveling basket. From this basket they are forced through a tube to an\r\noil mill which usually stands in another part of the grounds."\r\n\r\n"Cottonseed oil!" murmured Mary, recognizing an old friend. "We often\r\nuse it to fry things. It\'s good on lettuce, too. But somehow I never\r\nthought that it was really made from the seeds of cotton."\r\n\r\n"We often accept terms without thinking much about them, don\'t we?"\r\nCaptain Dillingham agreed. "But cottonseed oil is a genuine by-product\r\nof cotton."\r\n\r\n"What is a by-product?" smiled Mary ingenuously.\r\n\r\n"A by-product is something made from the leavings," put in Carl without\r\nhesitation. "Hash is a by-product of corned beef."\r\n\r\nA laugh greeted the assertion.\r\n\r\n"Technically speaking a by-product is something that is turned to\r\naccount from what would otherwise have been waste. Every person who\r\nmanufactures on a large scale tries to think what he can do with what\r\nis left after he has made the thing he started out to make. This he\r\ndoes for two reasons: first he wishes to turn back into money every\r\nounce of material for which he has paid; secondly he desires to get rid\r\nof stuff which would otherwise accumulate and (if not combustible)\r\nforce him into the added expense of carting it away. In other words he\r\nseeks to convert his waste into an asset instead of a liability.\r\nTherefore all big producers tax their brains to invent things that can\r\nbe made from their waste, and such commodities are called by-products.\r\nMany of these things require no ingenuity for frequently they are\r\narticles much needed in other trades. Masons, for example, are only too\r\nthankful to have the hair taken from tanned leather to hold their\r\nplaster together; and those who dry and salt fish can easily turn the\r\nfish skins into glue. The by-products of great packing houses and\r\ntanneries are legion. Often such dealers will have at hand such a\r\nsupply of usable stuff that they will establish other factories where\r\ntheir unused materials can be converted into cash. The sale of these\r\nproducts often increases very materially the profits of a business.\r\nSuch a product is cottonseed oil. As millions more seeds mature each\r\nyear than can possibly be used for planting why not turn them to\r\naccount? Often there are from sixty-five to seventy-five pounds of\r\nseeds to a hundred pounds of cotton. Think how rapidly they would\r\naccumulate if something could not be done with them. During the war\r\nwhen we were unable to get olive oil from Italy and fats of all kinds\r\nwere scarce we were thankful enough to fall back on the cottonseed oil\r\nmade in our own country. At the oil mills machines are ready to clean\r\nthe cotton seeds of lint, hull them, separate hull from kernel, and\r\npress the oil from the kernel itself. This oil is then bottled,\r\nlabelled, and shipped for sale, making quite an independent little\r\nindustry, you see. What is left of the crushed kernels is removed from\r\nthe hydraulic presses and is remolded into small cakes to be used\r\nfor----" he paused, glancing quizzically toward Carl and Mary.\r\n\r\n"For what?" the boy asked.\r\n\r\n"Guess!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not the most remote idea," Carl returned.\r\n\r\n"Nor I!" echoed Mary.\r\n\r\n"For cattle to eat," went on Captain Dillingham, completing his\r\nunfinished sentence.\r\n\r\n"Even the hulls," he continued, "are, I believe, utilized in some way;\r\nand as I previously told you the lint which clings to the seeds is\r\npassed through a second sort of gin, gathered into a bundle, and\r\nafterward put through a carding engine which combs it out and prepares\r\nit so it can be made into wadding for coverlids, quilted linings, and\r\nquilted petticoats. All the gins then collect whatever material is left\r\nand this, being absolutely too poor for any other purpose, is sold as\r\ncotton waste to be used for cleaning machinery and polishing brass and\r\nnickel trimmings. Were we individuals half as thrifty as are\r\nmanufacturers in salvaging the odds and ends that come our way we might\r\nsave ourselves many a penny. Every year we Americans throw away enough\r\nfood and wearing apparel to maintain a small army. We are, alas, a very\r\nwasteful people and are constantly becoming more so. Our ancestors used\r\nto lay aside buttons, string, papers, scraps of cloth and use them\r\nagain. They made over clothing, fashioned rag rugs, conserved\r\neverything they could lay hands on. Their attics were museums where\r\nwere horded every sort of object against the time when it might be\r\nneeded. But do we follow their example? No, indeed! In fact, we go to\r\nthe other extreme and hurry out of the house, either to a junk dealer\r\nor a rummage sale, everything we cannot find immediate use for. To a\r\ncertain extent our mode of living has forced us to this course. Most of\r\nus reside in cramped city quarters where there are no spacious attics\r\nin which to garner up articles against a rainy day. Modern apartment\r\ndwellers boast neither attic nor cellar, to say nothing of a farmer\'s\r\nbarn loft. Moreover, we all must scramble so fast to earn our daily\r\nbread that we have no time to make over the old; it is cheaper, we\r\nreason, to purchase new than to fuss with remodelling. Neither are\r\nmaterials what they were in the old days. Few of the fine old silks and\r\nwoolens that would wear for a generation are to be had at present. Also\r\nwe have more money than our forebears and this has much to do with our\r\nwholesale wastefulness. With plenty of everything at hand, why save?\r\nAnd the policy the individual is following on a small scale the nation\r\nis adopting on a much vaster one. We are using up our forests, our\r\nmines, all our resources with no thought of the morrow. We ought to\r\nstop and think about this before it is too late but I doubt if we ever\r\nwill."\r\n\r\nCaptain Dillingham paused.\r\n\r\n"There is such a thing," he added, "as people and nations being too\r\nprosperous for their own good. But to return to the cotton gin. The\r\ncotton, having been cleared of its seeds, is now known as lint, and\r\nthis is bundled together until enough of it is collected to be properly\r\nbaled for the spinning mills."\r\n\r\n"What is _proper baling_?" inquired Carl.\r\n\r\n"Why, the rough baling simply gathers the cotton together into a big\r\nbundle."\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s the matter with that?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing--so far as it goes," laughed the Captain. "I should be sorry,\r\nhowever, to see many such bales coming aboard my ship."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you know what cotton is," answered Uncle Frederick. "After it\r\nhas been picked to pieces in the gins it comes out a nice, white,\r\nfluffy mass that takes up no end of room. Were it to be transported in\r\nthis condition a few hundred pounds of it would fill a ship or freight\r\ncar and cost the owner so much that it would not be worth his while to\r\ntransport it. Moreover, it would be bothersome to handle when it\r\narrived at the spinning mills. Therefore before cotton is shipped it\r\nhas to be reduced in bulk so that it will not take up so much space."\r\n\r\n"But how can it be, Uncle Frederick? asked Mary, open-eyed.\r\n\r\n"What do you do when you wish to make some soft material into a small\r\nparcel, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, roll it up--squeeze it together," was the instant response.\r\n\r\n"Well, there you have your answer!" responded Uncle Frederick. "Balers\r\ntreat cotton lint in the same fashion; only, as they are not strong\r\nenough to accomplish this end with their hands, they resort to powerful\r\nmachines, or compressors, to carry out the process for them. By means\r\nof enormous pressure they crush down the billowing lint until four feet\r\nof it can be reduced to a thickness of not more than seven inches."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t want to fall into that machine! chuckled Carl.\r\n\r\n"There wouldn\'t be much left of you if you should, I can assure you of\r\nthat," Captain Dillingham said. "Cotton, however, does not raise any\r\nsuch protest. It is pressed and pressed and pressed, and while still in\r\nthe presses iron bands are put round it to hold it so it can be\r\ncompactly transported. An American bale of some five hundred pounds\r\nwill usually have six or seven of these iron bands round it. Certain of\r\nthese bales are merely rough ones; others are cylindrical. I believe\r\nthe latter sort are more generally preferred. To make them the cotton\r\nis gradually pressed and rolled by powerful presses until a bale four\r\nfeet long and about two feet through is obtained. These cylindrical\r\nbales weigh a trifle less than the others--about four hundred and\r\ntwenty-six pounds--and because they have been pressed so hard they keep\r\nin place without either iron bands or cloth covers. When they arrive at\r\nthe mills the cotton from them can be unrolled and much more easily fed\r\ninto the machines. If they are covered it is merely to keep them\r\nclean."\r\n\r\n"Do all bales of cotton have to weigh the same?" inquired Carl.\r\n\r\n"You mean is there a standardized weight for all bales?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"No, there is no universal standard for bales of cotton. The bales from\r\ndifferent countries differ quite considerably. For example a Brazilian\r\nbale usually weighs only from a hundred and seventy-five to two hundred\r\nand twenty pounds; the Turkish from two hundred and fifty to three\r\nhundred and twenty-five pounds; those coming from India do better,\r\naveraging about three hundred and ninety pounds. Should you handle this\r\nimported cotton you would notice that the bales from India are very\r\nheavily banded, often as many as thirteen bands encircling them. This\r\nis partly because the long staple of this variety of cotton must not be\r\ninjured by heavy pressure, and partly because they have not in India\r\nthe excellent facilities for compressing lint that we have here. The\r\nEgyptian bales are the largest transported; they run as high as seven\r\nhundred pounds and have about eleven bands to hold them."\r\n\r\n"It must be a stunt to get them aboard ship," grinned Carl.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve taken my turn at the job," responded the captain drily. "We swing\r\nthem down into the hold by means of cranes and have now learned to land\r\nthem quite neatly. Nevertheless, even though they are only bundles of\r\ncotton wool I should not fancy having one of them drop on my head,"\r\nconcluded he with a twinkle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA FAMILY CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime while the McGregors discussed cotton and the sunny southern\r\nfields in which it grew, Christmas was approaching and Baileyville,\r\nshrouded in wintry whiteness, began to feel the pulse of the coming\r\nholiday. Shop windows along the main street were gay with holly and\r\nscarlet. Every alluring object was displayed to entice purchasers and\r\nsuch objects as were not alluring were made to appear so by a garnish\r\nof ribbon or flashing tinsel. There were Christmas carpet sweepers,\r\nChristmas teakettles, Christmas coal hods and how surprised and\r\nembarrassed they must have been to find themselves dragged out of their\r\nmodest corners and, arrayed in splendor, set forth before the public\r\ngaze. Nothing was too mundane to be transformed by the holiday\'s magic\r\ninto a thing mystic and unreal. Even such a prosaic article as a\r\nwashtub, borrowing luster from the season\'s witchery and in shining\r\nblue dress became a thing to covet and dream about.\r\n\r\nThen there was the army of foolish trifles that owed their existence\r\nmerely to the season\'s glamor and would have had no excuse for being at\r\na time when the purchaser\'s head was level and his judgment sane. And\r\nin addition to all these there were the scores upon scores of gifts\r\nuseful, fascinating, desirable, but beyond range of possibility at any\r\nordinary period of the year.\r\n\r\nOh, it was a time to keep one\'s balance, the Christmas holidays! The\r\nvery stones of the streets glistened golden and the crisp air breathed\r\nenchantment. If one\'s nerves were not frayed and on edge he jostled his\r\nneighbor with a smile and took his share of jostling in good part. Was\r\nnot every man a brother; and did not a great throbbing kindliness\r\nemanate from all humanity?\r\n\r\nIt seemed so to Carl McGregor as the wonderful day of days drew near;\r\nand so also it seemed to all the wee McGregors. They were on tiptoe\r\nwith excitement and could hardly be made to stand still long enough to\r\nhave their neckties tied or their pinafores buttoned.\r\n\r\n"Have you children decided yet what you want to do?" questioned their\r\nmother one morning, as she struggled to hold the wriggling Tim until\r\nhis hair could be made presentable for school. "Christmas is but a week\r\naway now and we must come to some decision as to our plans. We can\'t\r\nhave everything, you know. Shall it be a turkey and no tree? Or shall\r\nit be a tree and no turkey? And if it is a tree shall it be a big or a\r\nlittle one? We must vote on all these questions."\r\n\r\n"I want ice-teem," lisped Nell.\r\n\r\n"Mercy on us!" ejaculated Mrs. McGregor, in consternation, as this\r\nfresh avenue for outlay presented itself. "Nell is for ice cream and a\r\ntree too."\r\n\r\n"And turkey!" went on the little one imperturbably. "Me wants turkey!"\r\n\r\n"Ice-treem! Ice-treem!" cooed James Frederick.\r\n\r\nThe mother\'s face clouded. A tree, turkey, ice cream and presents were\r\nfar beyond the range of the family purse.\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather have stockings and turkey," Mary declared.\r\n\r\n"And cranberry sauce and nuts," put in Tim.\r\n\r\n"And celery and sweet potatoes," added Carl. "A real dinner, Mother."\r\n\r\n"Would you rather do that than have the tree?"\r\n\r\nSilence greeted the question.\r\n\r\nInto every mind flashed the picture of a tree towering to the ceiling\r\nand a-glitter with lights and ornaments. Even Carl, despite his\r\nfourteen years, could not entirely banish the vision. But the dinner,\r\nthe dinner! After all the tree would only be a thing to look at; food\r\ncould be eaten and enjoyed, and Carl was a healthy boy at an age when\r\nhe was possessed of a particularly healthy appetite. Tempting as was\r\nthe tree the aroma of browned turkey rose in his nostrils.\r\n\r\n"I vote for turkey," announced he at last.\r\n\r\n"No tree? No Christmas tree?" murmured Martin, his lip quivering.\r\n\r\n"You have a tree at kindergarten, silly, and so does Nell," declared\r\nthe elder brother quickly.\r\n\r\n"\'Tain\'t like having it here--our really own tree," bewailed Martin.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t we have a simpler dinner, Mother, and manage to get a tree?"\r\ninterrogated Mary. "It is fun to trim it and the little children love\r\nit so."\r\n\r\n"Girls always like things that look pretty," piped Tim in disdain.\r\n\r\n"And all boys care about is to eat and eat," Mary shot out with equal\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\nHidden away in a corner behind his newspaper Captain Dillingham\r\nchuckled. He was vastly amused by this family congress.\r\n\r\nMeantime Mrs. McGregor, in order to avert the battle she saw rising,\r\nsaid, "Suppose we put it to vote. Are you ready for the question?"\r\n\r\n"Yes!" responded her flock in chorus.\r\n\r\n"All right. Shall it be presents and turkey, or presents and a tree?"\r\n\r\n"I want mince pie," proclaimed Martin flatly.\r\n\r\n"But we are not talking of pie, dear," answered his mother patiently.\r\n"It is the turkey we\'re voting on."\r\n\r\n"I want turkey _and_ a tree _and_ presents _and_ ice-teem _and_ pie!"\r\nNell asserted shamelessly.\r\n\r\n"Stockings and turkey, Ma! Stockings and turkey!" shouted Carl.\r\n\r\n"Listen, dears!" began their mother. "As I told you before we can\'t\r\nhave everything. I wish we could but we just plain can\'t, so that ends\r\nit. Therefore we must choose what we think we will get the most\r\npleasure out of. Now who is for turkey? Raise your hands!"\r\n\r\nEvery hand came up.\r\n\r\n"And who is for a tree?"\r\n\r\nAgain every hand was raised.\r\n\r\nHelplessly Mrs. McGregor sank back into her chair.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," sighed she. "Don\'t you see we are getting nowhere? I told\r\nyou only a minute ago we couldn\'t have both."\r\n\r\nUncle Frederick came out from behind his paper.\r\n\r\n"See here, you young savages," began he, laughing good-humoredly,\r\n"listen to me! If you do not get down to business and use some sense,\r\nChristmas will be here and you will have nothing at all."\r\n\r\nA wail ascended from Nell and Martin.\r\n\r\n"Your mother can give you either turkey or a tree; but she can\'t give\r\nyou both. In my opinion she is almighty good to do so much."\r\n\r\nHe saw the children flush uncomfortably. Carl dropped his eyes and Mary\r\nslipped a hand into her mother\'s.\r\n\r\n"Now instead of clamoring at her like a lot of ungrateful little brutes\r\nand wanting the whole earth, why don\'t you show her you are grateful\r\nfor what she\'s doing?" went on Captain Dillingham in a sharper tone.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s all right, Frederick," interrupted Mrs. McGregor hurriedly.\r\n"I don\'t want----"\r\n\r\nThe captain, however, was not to be stopped.\r\n\r\n"Your mother is ready to give you turkey _or_ a tree. How many are for\r\nturkey?"\r\n\r\nCarl and Tim raised their hands.\r\n\r\n"And who is for the tree?"\r\n\r\nInstantly Mary, Martin, and Nell raised their hands.\r\n\r\n"It is the tree, as I see it," acclaimed he.\r\n\r\n"But it isn\'t fair," Tim objected. "James Frederick didn\'t vote."\r\n\r\nAt this everybody laughed and whatever tension there was vanished.\r\n\r\n"Oh, James Frederick would vote for the tree," Mary said. "He is so\r\nlittle he couldn\'t eat turkey if we had it, could he, Mother?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he couldn\'t," smiled her mother. "He hasn\'t teeth enough."\r\n\r\n"Then it is a tree! A tree!" cried Martin exultantly.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" Captain Dillingham put up his hand. "We haven\'t finished with\r\nthis matter yet. You\'ve got your tree from your mother; now I can give\r\nyou a turkey if you decide you want me to. But first you are to listen\r\nto what I have to say. A Christmas tree and a turkey mean a great deal\r\nfor one family to have in these days when so many people are having so\r\nlittle. The O\'Dowds, for example, are to have neither a Christmas\r\ndinner nor a tree; I happen to know that. Joey has been sick and there\r\nare doctor\'s bills to pay. Beside that, Mr. O\'Dowd has been out of work\r\nand has no money to spend this year."\r\n\r\nThe little McGregors regarded their uncle with solemn faces.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear!" breathed Mary sympathetically.\r\n\r\nCarl scowled soberly; then his face glowed with a sudden idea.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t we----" he hesitated awkwardly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Uncle Frederick, if you _were_ really going to buy a turkey,\r\ncouldn\'t we give it to them?" flashed Mary, smiling toward her brother.\r\n"Would you mind giving it away to somebody else? You see, if you were\r\ngoing to buy it anyway----" she regarded her uncle timidly, "we could\r\nhave something else for dinner, couldn\'t we, Mother? Perhaps corn\r\nchowder. We all like that. And maybe we could have a pudding and some\r\nnuts."\r\n\r\n"Bully, Mary! I\'m with you!" Carl rejoined.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to do that, too," agreed Martin. "I wouldn\'t mind so much\r\nabout the turkey if we had the tree."\r\n\r\n"What do you say, Tim?" inquired Captain Dillingham.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why we should give our turkey to somebody else," grumbled\r\nTim sullenly. "We never have one all the year--never! You know we\r\ndon\'t, Mother."\r\n\r\n"No, dear; I\'m afraid we don\'t," Mrs. McGregor said.\r\n\r\n"Then why should we give ours away," went on Tim in an argumentative\r\ntone. "Don\'t we want turkey as much as the O\'Dowds, I\'d like to know?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Timmie!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be such a pig, Tim," cut in Carl with brotherly directness. "If\r\nwe were hard up, wouldn\'t you like somebody to send you something for\r\nChristmas?"\r\n\r\nTim colored, his brother\'s question bringing home to him uncomfortable\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\n"We could have such fun doing it, Timmie," coaxed Mary. "Think how we\r\ncould trim up the basket, and what a surprise it would be! Why, it\r\nwould make no end of sport."\r\n\r\nTim\'s expression softened.\r\n\r\nInstantly Mrs. McGregor, who was quick to interpret her children\'s\r\nmoods, saw the battle was won.\r\n\r\n"We can plan together what shall go into the basket," said she briskly.\r\n"Each of us might contribute the thing he likes best."\r\n\r\n"The turkey shall be mine!" Uncle Frederick declared.\r\n\r\n"I choose cranberry sauce!" Carl announced.\r\n\r\n"Celery! Oh, could I put in celery, Mother?" Mary inquired. "The tops\r\nare so pretty and I love it so!"\r\n\r\nHer mother nodded.\r\n\r\n"Somebody must give the plain things so I will donate potatoes, squash,\r\nand onions," she said.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t forget nuts! We must have nuts and raisins," Mary added.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to give those," Tim whispered.\r\n\r\n"You shall, son."\r\n\r\nA friendly little glance passed between the boy and his mother.\r\n\r\n"Pie! I want pie!" asserted Nell, who although too young to understand\r\nwhat was going on, nevertheless grasped the notion that food was the\r\nprevailing topic and plunged into the subject with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"Bless your heart, dearie, you shall have pie!" laughed her mother.\r\n"I\'ll make a couple of apple pies and they shall be your present."\r\n\r\n"There ought to be candy. Please let me send candy! May I?" begged\r\nMartin for whom the world held only two articles really worth\r\nwhile--candy and ice cream.\r\n\r\nThere was general merriment at this suggestion.\r\n\r\n"Precious little candy would ever get to anybody else if you had the\r\ngiving of it, Martie," teased Mary.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Martin shall give the candy," Mrs. McGregor consented.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll paste his mouth up before he goes to buy it," Carl drawled.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you s\'pose I could keep from eating it if once I set out to?"\r\nscowled Martin defiantly.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I could, so now!" The boy drew himself up proudly.\r\n\r\n"James Frederick ought to send something, Mother," reminded the\r\ncare-taking Mary. "We don\'t want him left out."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we mustn\'t leave out the baby!" agreed Captain Dillingham. "He and\r\nI will get together and talk the matter over. There are still several\r\nthings needed."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it will be splendid!" cried Mary, clapping her hands. "Do get a\r\nreal big turkey, won\'t you, Uncle Frederick? And we\'ll trim it up with\r\na necklace of cranberries the way they do in the market."\r\n\r\n"Huh! There you go again," sniffed Tim. "All girls seem to think of is\r\nnecklaces and bows of ribbon."\r\n\r\nMary smiled brightly.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the harm in making it pretty if you can just as well?" asked\r\nshe. "I do love pretty things. Why, I believe I could eat stewed whale\r\nif it was on a pretty dish."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t; I\'d hate whale," responded the stolid Timothy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I didn\'t mean I\'d really eat whale, silly," explained Mary.\r\n\r\n"Then what did you say you would for?"\r\n\r\n"Mary was just imagining, dear," put in Mrs. McGregor, coming to the\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\n"She is always imagining," glowered Tim. "Only the other day she was\r\ntrying to make me imagine my salt fish was chicken."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet she didn\'t succeed," taunted Carl.\r\n\r\n"Not on your life she didn\'t!" was the instant answer. "I know salt\r\nfish when I see it."\r\n\r\n"No matter, dear," soothed Mrs. McGregor, affectionately touching her\r\ndaughter\'s arm. "If her imagining Mary can convert salt fish into\r\nchicken it is an asset that will stand her in good stead all through\r\nlife. And if you, Tim, prefer to keep your salt fish just salt fish,\r\nwhy you have a perfect right to do so. I will say, however, that the\r\nperson who has the power to make believe has an invaluable gift. Many\'s\r\nthe time I\'ve made believe and it has helped me over more than one hard\r\nspot. We all have to masquerade to a greater or less degree. It is\r\nsimply meeting life with imagination and seeing in the humdrum\r\nsomething that associates it with finer and more beautiful things." For\r\na moment she was silent; then she added in her quick, businesslike\r\naccents, "And now to this dinner! There must be a basket to hold it, of\r\ncourse."\r\n\r\n"A big market basket, Mother, lined with red paper. Do line it with\r\nred," pleaded Mary.\r\n\r\n"It shall be lined with red, little lady! And trimmed with holly, too!"\r\nreplied Uncle Frederick. "I will undertake to furnish both decorations\r\nalong with the turkey."\r\n\r\n"Why not put in Santa Claus napkins? I saw some paper ones the other\r\nday and they were tremendously festive," suggested Mrs. McGregor.\r\n\r\n"I think the best plan is for us all to go together and buy the\r\ndinner," the Captain suddenly announced.\r\n\r\nShouts of approval greeted the plan.\r\n\r\n"But the baby!" demurred his sister.\r\n\r\n"We can wheel James Frederick in the carriage and take turns staying\r\noutside the shops with him," said Carl.\r\n\r\n"And if we have the carriage we can bring home our stuff in it," put in\r\nTim.\r\n\r\n"Poor baby! How would you like to have a big ten-pound turkey piled on\r\ntop of you?" questioned Mary indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, James Frederick won\'t mind," Tim responded comfortably. "And\r\nanyhow, he\'s got to do his bit toward making other people happy. As far\r\nas I can see he isn\'t denying himself anything, for he couldn\'t eat a\r\nturkey if it was set right under his nose. So it\'s his part to tote\r\nhome the parcels in his flivver; he seems to be the only member of the\r\nfamily that has one."\r\n\r\nThus it was agreed and on the day before Christmas it would have done\r\none good to witness the cavalcade of McGregors issuing forth on their\r\naltruistic pilgrimage. First went Mary, leading Nell by the hand; then\r\nCarl with Martin\'s mitten firmly clutched in his. Next came Mrs.\r\nMcGregor with Tim, and bringing up at the rear was Uncle Frederick\r\nwheeling his namesake, the baby. What a tour it was! Certainly there\r\nnever had been such a turkey as the one the reckless captain bought--a\r\nturkey so plump of breast, so white of skin, so golden of claw! Why, it\r\nwas a king of birds! And then the shining coral of the cranberries, the\r\nsatin gleam of the onions, the warm brown of the potatoes! As for the\r\ncelery--its delicate green and faint canary tips were as good as a\r\nbouquet of flowers. Just to view its crispness was to make the mouth\r\nwater. And the nuts, raisins, candy, oranges! Once in their vicinity\r\nCaptain Dillingham cast aside all caution and wildly purchased one\r\ndainty after another. He seemed to have gone quite mad and it was not\r\nuntil his sister very positively informed him that not another bundle\r\ncould be carried that he consented to be dragged away from the counters\r\nof sweet-meats.\r\n\r\nThen staggering beneath their load of whity-brown parcels, the family\r\nhastened out to the baby carriage where Mary stood guarding James\r\nFrederick.\r\n\r\n"Put the turkey down near his feet," cried she excitedly, as she lifted\r\nthe baby in order to make more room. "The other things can be packed in\r\nround him."\r\n\r\n"But he\'ll be stifled!" objected Mrs. McGregor.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, he won\'t, Ma!" contradicted Tim. "He\'ll probably be uncomfortable.\r\nChristmas comes but once a year, though, so he ought to be able to survive\r\nbeing cramped."\r\n\r\n"Oh, James Frederick is perfectly used to having his coup\xc3\xa9 turned into\r\nan express wagon, Mother," Carl explained. "Don\'t worry about him.\r\nOften he rides home from down-town buried a foot deep in bundles. All\r\nthat fusses me is whether the carriage will stand the strain. If it\r\nshould part in the middle and the front wheels go off on an independent\r\nroute it would be----"\r\n\r\n"Both inconvenient and embarrassing," concluded Captain Dillingham with\r\na laugh.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, James Frederick\'s chariot was staunchly\r\nconstructed and reached Mulberry Court without mishap, its precious\r\ncontents--including the patient owner of the vehicle--being borne\r\ntriumphantly aloft to the McGregor flat. Once upstairs the basket,\r\nscarlet paper, and holly were produced, and Mary with deft fingers went\r\nto work to fashion a receptacle worthy of the bounties with which the\r\nO\'Dowds were to be surprised. At last into this garish hamper were\r\npacked the viands and afterward a card bearing holiday greetings was\r\ntied to the handle with a flaring red bow.\r\n\r\n"Now the worst task is to come," declared Mrs. McGregor, "and that is\r\nto land the present at Julie\'s door without being caught. They are\r\nproud people, the O\'Dowds, and I wouldn\'t for worlds have them know\r\nfrom whom the dinner comes. Timmie is not strong enough to take it and\r\nCarl is too clumsy. Should he start to run away, like as not he would\r\nstumble and bring all Mulberry Court to see what the racket was."\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t I carry it?" inquired Captain Dillingham.\r\n\r\n"You! One sight of your gold buttons would be enough, Frederick.\r\nBesides, you\'re none too agile in making a getaway."\r\n\r\n"I fancy some boy could be found to leave it if I paid him," suggested\r\nthe captain.\r\n\r\n"The very thing! There\'s a score of \'em on the street. Fetch in the\r\nfastest runner you see, Timmie. No matter whether you know him or not.\r\nIn fact, get one you don\'t know. \'Twill be all the better."\r\n\r\nAway sped Tim only to return an instant later with a grimy, Italian\r\nyoungster at his heels.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dillingham explained the errand.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the gleaming quarter of a dollar the Italian grinned.\r\nHe would leave a bomb or a live ox at anybody\'s door for a quarter,\r\naffirmed he with an ingratiating smile.\r\n\r\nTherefore the precious basket was entrusted to him and to judge by the\r\nscampering that followed its thud before the O\'Dowds\' door he was quite\r\nas fleet of foot as Tim had asserted.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t you like to see their faces when they find it?" whispered\r\nCarl who, with Mary, was hanging over the banister, straining his ears\r\nfor every sound.\r\n\r\nThere was not, however, much to hear.\r\n\r\nAfter the furious knock somebody ventured into the hall. Then Julie\'s\r\nvoice, high-pitched with excitement and consternation, exclaimed,\r\n"Mercy on us!" With that she dragged the basket into her abode and\r\nbanged the door.\r\n\r\nIt was a brief drama but one entirely satisfying to the McGregors. Over\r\nand over again did Carl and Mary enact the scene to the intense delight\r\nof the family.\r\n\r\n"Now mind, should Mrs. O\'Dowd come up here with questions, you are to\r\nbe careful what you say," cautioned their mother. "There\'s to be no\r\nhinting, winking, or smirking. Should Julie say anything, leave it to\r\nyour uncle or me to answer. All the fun would be spoiled if you gave\r\nthe secret away."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," agreed Carl. "The sport is to keep folks guessing."\r\n\r\nBut no sooner were the words out of his mouth is than there was a\r\nrapping at the hall door.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ma! I\'ll bet that is Mrs. O\'Dowd now!" gasped Mary.\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be! She\'d not track us down so quick as this," replied Mrs.\r\nMcGregor, flustered and half rising.\r\n\r\n"Most likely it\'s the Christmas tree, Mother," Tim suggested. "They\r\npromised to send it early this afternoon."\r\n\r\nAgain came the knock.\r\n\r\n"I\'m half afraid to open the door lest it be Julie," faltered Mrs.\r\nMcGregor. "Be still a minute, all of you, till I think what I\'ll say to\r\nher."\r\n\r\nBut when, amid a tense hush, the door was finally opened, neither Julie\r\nO\'Dowd nor the watched-for Christmas tree was on the threshold. Instead\r\nthey saw a holly-decked basket so exactly a replica of the one they had\r\ngiven away that a cry of disappointment greeted it.\r\n\r\n"She\'s sent it back!" cried Mary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "But that isn\'t our basket, Mother," Carl said. "This\r\nis much bigger." _Page_ 155.]\r\n\r\n"She was offended and wouldn\'t take it!" murmured Mrs. McGregor. "I\r\nfeared as much."\r\n\r\n"But that isn\'t our basket, Mother," Carl said. "This is much bigger.\r\nBesides, we had no apples or candy bags in the one we sent."\r\n\r\nCritically studying the gift, the family clustered around.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t our basket, Mother," Mary presently asserted. "See, this one\r\nis red."\r\n\r\n"There must be some mistake, then," Mrs. McGregor declared. "They\'ve\r\nleft it at the wrong place."\r\n\r\n"But our name is on it!" cried Tim.\r\n\r\n"Where? Where?" What a bumping of heads there was as everybody bent to\r\nread the card.\r\n\r\n"Yes, our name is on it plain as day!" replied Mrs. McGregor with a\r\npuzzled expression. Then, inspired by a solution of the mystery, she\r\nwheeled round on her brother.\r\n\r\n"How much do you know about this, Frederick?"\r\n\r\n"Not a thing, Nellie--I give you my word! Dearly as I should have liked\r\nto send you such a gift, my purse wasn\'t quite good for it," flushed\r\nthe captain.\r\n\r\n"And what wonder, with all you\'ve spent this day," returned his sister\r\nquickly. "Then we\'ll count you out. But where could it have come from?"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t need to leave it in the hall until we find out, do we,\r\nMother?" Mary ventured mischievously.\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose we don\'t," was the retort. "Timmie, you and Carl drag it\r\nindoors. Don\'t try to lift it, for you\'ll only be straining yourselves\r\nand maybe drop it. Let\'s get it into the kitchen. There may be some\r\nclue when we have a better light."\r\n\r\nBut examine it as they would, no hint as to the mysterious sender could\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\n"I guess he believes with Carl that the sport of giving a present is to\r\nkeep the other person guessing," Tim remarked wickedly.\r\n\r\nA general laugh at Carl\'s expense greeted the observation.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" cautioned Mrs. McGregor. "There\'s somebody in the hall."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t get away this time," Carl cried, springing up and throwing\r\nopen the door.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens, man! You nearly knocked me down!" cried Hal Harling,\r\namazed by the suddenness of his welcome. "What\'s the matter with you?\r\nTrying to trap a burglar?" Then, glancing at the object about which the\r\nhousehold were clustering, he added, "Jove! Have you got one, too?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, just now somebody left a basket exactly like this at our flat. I\r\nthought maybe you folks had something to do with it and came straight\r\nover here to see. But you seem to be favored by a similar gift. They\r\nare alike as two peas. Who sent them?"\r\n\r\n"That is precisely what we want to know," Carl replied.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no idea?"\r\n\r\n"Not the most remote."\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t Captain Dillingham?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not guilty, if that is what you mean," the sea captain answered.\r\n\r\n"Straight goods?" Hal insisted.\r\n\r\n"Hang, die, and choke to death!" laughed the little old man.\r\n\r\n"But--but--somebody sent the thing!" blustered Hal. "Why, there is\r\neverything on earth in it. Food enough to last a week. And ours has a\r\nshawl for my mother and some felt slippers for my grandfather in the\r\nbottom. And there are gloves for Louise and me. It came from somebody\r\nwho knew all about us. It was no haphazard present."\r\n\r\n"Can you beat it!" murmured Carl. "Whoever do you suppose----"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t suppose. We thought it was you," announced Hal. "There\'s a\r\nknock at the door. Shall I go?"\r\n\r\nLeaping forward he turned the knob, and in came Mrs. O\'Dowd.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had the most wonderful basket sent me that ever----" began she;\r\nthen her eye fell upon the hamper in the center of the floor. "Glory be\r\nto goodness!" she ejaculated. "Wherever did you get that?"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t know," Carl answered.\r\n\r\n"And we\'ve one just like it and can\'t find out who sent us ours," put\r\nin Hal Harling.\r\n\r\n"Well, I thought for sure as you were the folks that sent me mine,"\r\ndeclared Julie. "But if they are being scattered broadcast and you are\r\ngetting one yourselves I reckon it is safe to say you don\'t know much\r\nabout where mine came from. Well, all I can say is may the sender of\r\nthem have a blessed Christmas. Owing to O\'Dowd being out of work, we\r\nwere to have a pretty slim celebration this year. The children were\r\nlike to get nothing at all. And then just when I was trying to comfort\r\nmyself with thinking how glad I should be that Joey was well, and that\r\nwe all had our health even if we did lack a turkey and the fixings,\r\nalong comes this windfall. Why, it is as if the heavens opened and\r\ndropped it straight down at our door. It does you good to know there\r\nare kind hearts in the world, doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nOne and all the McGregors smiled. If they wanted thanks for the\r\nself-denial they had practised they certainly had them in the gratitude\r\nthat beamed from Julie\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Well, it will be a royal Christmas for all of us, won\'t it?" went on\r\nthe little woman, bustling out. "I must hurry back downstairs. The\r\nchildren are that crazy they are like to eat the turkey raw, claws,\r\nneck and feathers!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come with you, Mrs. O\'Dowd," said Hal. "Good-by, and a Merry\r\nChristmas, everybody."\r\n\r\n"I\'m mighty glad we sent that dinner to the O\'Dowd\'s!" commented Carl\r\nsoberly, when the door was shut and the McGregors were alone. "I\'d be\r\nglad we did it even if we had no dinner of our own," he added, his eyes\r\nalight with a grave happiness.\r\n\r\n"And I, too," whispered Tim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nA CLUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, fluttering excitedly round a Christmas tree spangled\r\nwith tinsel and aglow with lights, the McGregors received their\r\npresents; and not they alone, for Julie O\'Dowd, with her five\r\nyoungsters, swelled the party, together with the Murphys and the\r\nSullivans from the floors below. There was popcorn for everybody and\r\nsatiny striped candy, and from the mysterious basket an orange for each\r\nguest was produced.\r\n\r\n"When we have so much ourselves it would be wrong to keep it all," Mrs.\r\nMcGregor had asserted; and her household fully agreed with her.\r\nTherefore the neighbors were summoned in to share in the festivity.\r\n\r\nAnd after the visitors had trailed down the long stairway, shouting\r\nback their pleasure and gratitude, the wonderful dinner the hamper\r\ncontained was prepared, and what a delightful ceremonial that was! Did\r\never any such tantalizing aroma drift upon the air as ascended from the\r\nbrowning turkey? Or did ever potatoes so fill their jackets to\r\nbursting? As for the celery--it was like ivory; and the cranberry jelly\r\nas transparent and glowing as a huge ruby. And, oh, the browning crust\r\nof the mince pies! So many hungry little McGregors swarmed round the\r\nstove it was a marvel some of them were not burned to death on hot\r\nstove covers or the oven door. One could scarcely baste the turkey\r\nwithout falling over two or three of them.\r\n\r\nHowever, nobody was scalded or blistered and when at length the great\r\nbronzed bird was borne from the oven a procession of exultant children\r\nfollowed in the wake of the huge platter, every one of them shouting\r\nfor the wishbone or a drumstick.\r\n\r\n"Was the creature a centipede he would hardly have drumsticks to\r\nsatisfy you!" laughed their mother. "Who ever saw such a lot of\r\ncannibals! Was anybody to hear your hubbub they\'d think you had never\r\nhad a mouthful to eat in all your lives. I don\'t believe your uncle\r\never saw worse heathen in the South Sea Islands."\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of her caustic comment, it was plain that the\r\nmother was enjoying her children\'s pleasure and that Uncle Frederick\r\nwas enjoying it too.\r\n\r\n"Well," went on Mrs. McGregor, "if you do not get filled up to-day it\r\nwill be your own fault. I shall put no check on anybody. You may eat\r\nall you\'ll hold."\r\n\r\nProfiting by this spacious permission the McGregors fell to and what a\r\nfeast they had! Never had they dreamed of such a meal. Even Carl and\r\nMartin, whose capacity appeared to be limitless, were at length forced\r\nto confess that for once in their lives they had had enough; as for Tim\r\nhe sank back in his chair almost in tears because he could not find\r\nroom for another mouthful.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t squeeze down a single \'nother thing if I was paid for it,"\r\nwailed he. "And I did so want a second helping of pudding! Why didn\'t\r\nyou stop me, Ma, when I started out on that giant sweet potato?"\r\n\r\nHis mother shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"You must learn to make your own choices," said she. "Perhaps \'twill\r\nteach you next time not to covet all you see. And now, before we begin\r\nto clear up, I want to make sure you are all content. There must be no\r\nregrets. I don\'t want to hear to-morrow that you wish you had had\r\nso-and-so. So think well before the food is whisked into the pantry.\r\nHas everybody had enough?"\r\n\r\nA chorus of muffled groans arose.\r\n\r\n"What do you think we are, Ma?" Tim managed to murmur.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I don\'t know," was the grim retort. "I\'ve often wondered. So\r\nyou think you couldn\'t eat a morsel more?"\r\n\r\n"_Think!_ We know we couldn\'t," gasped Carl.\r\n\r\n"Then sit still a second, all of you, till I take a good look at you!"\r\ncommanded their mother. "That I should live to see the day when I would\r\ndish up a meal without some amongst you yammering for another helping!\r\nI\'m almost tempted to take an affidavit with your signatures in black\r\nand white and preserve it in the family Bible."\r\n\r\nWith arms akimbo she viewed her grinning flock.\r\n\r\n"Well, since you\'re beyond urging, we may as well turn to the dishes--that\r\nis, if anybody can stagger up and help."\r\n\r\nReaching over she began to remove the food from the table.\r\n\r\nMary sprang to aid her.\r\n\r\n"Let me carry the things into the pantry," Tim said. "Maybe if I walk\r\nround some it will shake down what I\'ve eaten."\r\n\r\n"Are you laying to eat another course?" derided Carl.\r\n\r\n"Aw, quit it!" growled Tim. "I\'ll bet I haven\'t made way with any more\r\nthan you have. Here, fork over that pie! I\'ll put it in the closet."\r\n\r\n"Can we trust you with it?" called Captain Dillingham.\r\n\r\nTim put up his hand.\r\n\r\n"Say, I wouldn\'t touch that pie if you were to go down on your knees\r\nand beg me to," Tim declared. "Millions wouldn\'t hire me!"\r\n\r\n"Give it to him, Carl; he sounds perfectly safe," asserted the lad\'s\r\nmother. "And put those apples and figs away, too, dear, if you are\r\ngoing into the pantry. Mary, you and Carl pile the dishes. What an army\r\nof them there are! I believe we have out every plate we own. Martin, do\r\ntake the babies into the next room where they will be out from under\r\nfoot. And watch that Nell doesn\'t eat the candles off the tree. She\'s\r\nalways thinking they are candy, the witch!"\r\n\r\n"You must let me help," urged Uncle Frederick, rolling up his sleeves.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you must not work to-day, Frederick," his sister protested. "It is\r\na holiday and you are on shore leave. Besides, it never seems right to\r\nme to see the captain of a ship working."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the captain of a ship knows the galley quite as well as the\r\nbridge," responded Uncle Frederick. Seizing a towel he stationed\r\nhimself beside Mary who was elbow deep in the dishpan. "All hands to\r\nthe pumps!" cried he sharply.\r\n\r\nIt was a ringing command and instantly Tim and Carl leaped forward to\r\nobey it.\r\n\r\nWhat a dish-wiping team the three made!\r\n\r\nMary could scarcely wash fast enough to keep up with them.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mrs. McGregor was here, there, and everywhere, putting\r\nto rights the disordered house; and so effectual was her touch that by\r\nthe time the last plate was on the shelf tranquillity reigned and\r\nexcept for lurking candy bags and stray bits of red ribbon it almost\r\nseemed as if there had never been such an event as a Christmas party.\r\n\r\n"Now why can\'t we all go over to the Harlings, Ma?" Carl inquired.\r\n"They will be through their dinner by this time. Hal asked if we\r\ncouldn\'t come."\r\n\r\n"But not all of us!" objected Mrs. McGregor. "Why, we\'re a caravan!"\r\n\r\n"Nobody minds caravans on Christmas," pleaded Carl. "Grandfather\r\nHarling would love to see the children. We haven\'t had them there for\r\never so long."\r\n\r\n"I suppose we might go. It isn\'t very far," his mother meditated.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do let\'s!" Tim put in. "I\'ll wheel James Frederick."\r\n\r\n"You? You couldn\'t wheel anything, so full are you of turkey and plum\r\npudding! If you get there yourself you will be doing well," was the\r\ncurt retort. "However, if you all want to go, I\'ll not hinder you.\r\nScurry and get your caps, coats, and mittens."\r\n\r\nOff flew the youngsters in every direction; off, too, flew Mrs.\r\nMcGregor with Nell and Martin at her heels and the baby in her arms.\r\n\r\nOwing to excitement and the general holiday confusion it was some time\r\nbefore there were two rubbers, two mittens, a cap, coat, and muffler\r\nfor everybody; on the very brink of departure a full equipment for\r\nMartin could not be found and to his unbounded delight he was compelled\r\nto set forth in one arctic and one rubber boot--a novel combination\r\nthat greatly heightened his pleasure in the trip and made him the envy\r\nof all his younger brothers and sisters. Whether his satisfaction would\r\nhave outlived a long journey is uncertain for the rubber boot proved to\r\nbe not only too large but treacherously leaky. Notwithstanding the\r\nfact, however, he was a sufficiently good sport to make the best of his\r\nunfortunate bargain and clatter up the long, dim flights that led to\r\nthe Harlings\' suite with as much spirit as the rest.\r\n\r\nAnd oh, such a welcome as the family received when they did arrive!\r\n\r\nIt would have warmed the heart to see the little ones rush to\r\nGrandfather Harling, clinging round him like a swarm of bees and\r\nclamoring for a story. And a story they got--and not only one but two,\r\nthree, for Grandfather was a rare story-teller and a great lover of\r\nchildren. Meantime the elders gossiped together, their chief topic of\r\nspeculation being the sender of the wonderful Christmas dinners.\r\n\r\n"If you hadn\'t got one, Carl, I should almost be tempted to think old\r\nCorcoran had sent ours to ease his conscience," Hal announced. "But of\r\ncourse he wouldn\'t have been stretching his philanthropy so far as\r\nMulberry Court, I\'m afraid."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m sure the dinner couldn\'t have come from Mr. Corcoran," put in\r\nLouise quickly. "It wouldn\'t be a bit like him to tie the nuts up with\r\nfancy ribbon, and tuck in the presents. No, somebody sent that dinner\r\nwho really cared, and took pains to have it pretty and tempting. Mr.\r\nCorcoran might order us a dinner at the market but he never would have\r\npacked the basket himself as--as--Mr. X did."\r\n\r\n"Well, all I can say is that Mr. X, whoever he is, is a corker; and may\r\nhe live long and prosper!" Hal declared.\r\n\r\n"He will prosper," murmured Mrs. Harling in her soft voice. "Such a man\r\ncannot help it."\r\n\r\n"I do wish, though, we knew who he is, don\'t you?" Mary asked. "I\'d\r\njust like to thank him."\r\n\r\n"I fancy Mr. X is not the sort that covets thanks," her mother replied.\r\n"Some people take their pleasure in doing a kind deed. I imagine\r\nLouise\'s Mr. X is one of that sort."\r\n\r\nSo they talked on, until suddenly glancing out of the window, Mrs.\r\nMcGregor exclaimed in consternation, "Why, it is snowing!"\r\n\r\nSure enough! A thick smother of flakes whirled down into the deserted\r\nstreets and cutting short Grandfather Harling\'s story, the visitors\r\nbundled themselves into their wraps.\r\n\r\n"I hope the children won\'t take cold," said Mrs. Harling anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Take cold? Mercy, no! They are tough as nuts, every soul of them,"\r\nanswered their mother. "Having no automobiles they gain it in their\r\nhealth. Poverty has its blessings--I\'ll say that! Now, Carl, you hold\r\nonto Nell and don\'t let her down on all fours; she is such a fat little\r\nblunderbuss! And Mary, keep Martin in the path if you can, or he will\r\nlose that huge rubber boot. Uncle Frederick is going to wheel the baby.\r\nAnd remember, Tim, there are to be no snowballs or snow down anybody\'s\r\nneck. You will have plenty of time for that sort of fun to-morrow, if\r\nyou call it fun. And, children, do try to go down the stairs quietly.\r\nDon\'t forget there are other people on earth besides yourselves. A\r\nMerry Christmas, everybody!"\r\n\r\n"And three cheers for Mr. X!" Hal added boyishly.\r\n\r\n"Hal Harling, don\'t you dare set this brood of mine cheering in the\r\nhallway! They\'ll raise the roof," ejaculated Mrs. McGregor, putting up\r\na warning finger. "Not but what I\'d gladly cheer the person who sent\r\nthose dinners; but we mustn\'t do it here."\r\n\r\n"Well, it was a jim-dandy dinner, anyway," chuckled Hal. "We\'ll be\r\neating that turkey for days. It was big as an ostrich!"\r\n\r\n"Maybe you drew an ostrich by mistake," grinned Carl. "Who knows?"\r\n\r\nOh, it would have taken hearts less merry than these to be dampened by\r\nthe storm! Home plodded the McGregors, shouting gaily amid the piling\r\ndrifts.\r\n\r\n"My, it is going to be a real blizzard!" Mrs. McGregor predicted.\r\n"Every tree and bush is laden already."\r\n\r\n"The little shrubs in the park look like cotton bushes," replied Uncle\r\nFrederick over his shoulder. "Look, youngsters! You were asking about\r\ncotton when it is ripe. That is much the way it looks." He motioned\r\ntoward the vista of bending foliage.\r\n\r\n"How pretty it is!" said Mary.\r\n\r\n"And in reality cotton is prettier by far, for there is always the blue\r\nof the sky, the gold of the sunshine, and the green of the country. It\r\nis as if one had a snowstorm in summer."\r\n\r\nThere was little opportunity for further talk for the trodden snow\r\nnarrowed into a ribbon and the walkers were obliged to thread the\r\ndrifts single file. At last, however, Mulberry Court came into view and\r\nwith a stamping of feet and a brushing of caps and coats the family\r\nwere within its welcoming portals. Then James Frederick was dug out of\r\nhis carriage, shaken, and borne crowing and rosy up the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe flat proved to be warm and comfortable and while Mary lighted the\r\nlamps her mother poked up the fire and sprinkled on more coal.\r\n\r\n"Now let\'s sit down everybody and have a nice, jolly evening," said she\r\nwhen the outer garments were all stowed away. "Come, Carl, draw up the\r\nrocker for Uncle Frederick. And, Timmie, there\'s room for you here\r\nbeside me. What\'s the matter, laddie?"\r\n\r\nFor answer Tim glanced at the steely blue hands of the clock now\r\npointing to six.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t we going to have any supper?" questioned he in an aggrieved\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"Supper!" exploded his mother. "Surely you are not looking for anything\r\nmore to eat to-day. You yourself declared only a little while ago that\r\nyou couldn\'t eat another morsel."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t a little while ago; it was hours," Tim affirmed. "We\'ve been\r\nto walk since then and I\'m hungry."\r\n\r\n"Hungry! Did you ever hear the likes! Hungry! And the bairn swallowing\r\ndown turkey until I expected every second he would have apoplexy!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m hungry, too," rejoined Carl with shame-faced candor.\r\n\r\n"So am I!" piped Martin.\r\n\r\n"Well, I never saw your match!" cried their mother, holding up her\r\nhands. "One would think you were cobras, anacondas, or something else\r\nout of the zoo. Still, I don\'t see as I can let you starve. If you\'re\r\nhungry there\'s the pantry with its shelves groaning aloud with food.\r\nRun in and help yourselves."\r\n\r\nHer family needed no second bidding. Above everything else they loved a\r\nmeal where all superfluous accessories such as knives, forks, and\r\nnapkins were done away with, and where there was no one at one\'s elbow\r\nto caution or demand the time-worn "pleases" and "thank you\'s." To\r\nforage in the pantry unrestrained was like being let loose in the vales\r\nof Arcadia. One after another they emerged, bearing in their hands the\r\nspoils most attracting their fancy.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not going to devour that whole cross section of squash pie, are\r\nyou, Tim?" asked Mary, aghast.\r\n\r\n"Sure I am," retorted the unabashed Timothy. "That is, unless you want\r\npart of it."\r\n\r\n"Of course I don\'t. But I should think you\'d die!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t expect to die," returned her imperturbable brother. "And if I\r\ndo I\'ll at least have had one everlasting good feed."\r\n\r\n"Tim!" expostulated his horrified mother.\r\n\r\n"Well, I will have," repeated the boy. "And anyhow, I don\'t believe\r\nI\'ve eaten so much more than other folks. I notice you don\'t mention\r\nlittle Carlie here. He\'s worried down some food to-day, and like as not\r\nHal Harling has, too. What\'s more, I\'ll bet a hat Hal won\'t go\r\nsupperless to bed."\r\n\r\nAt that moment a rap came at the door and Mary sprang forward to admit\r\nthe very young gentleman in question.\r\n\r\n"You see, I\'m returning your call on schedule time," grinned he,\r\nshaking the snow from his outer garments. "I can\'t stay but a moment;\r\nbut I had to come and tell you what\'s happened. What do you think of\r\nthat?" Diving into his pocket he held forth a handsome watch and chain.\r\n\r\n"Who\'ve you been robbing?" drawled Carl.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder you say so, kid. Can you beat it? Did you ever see such\r\na beauty?"\r\n\r\n"But--but--Hal, where on earth did you get a thing like that?"\r\n\r\n"Well may you ask, kid! Think of me hitched to a gold watch! Oh, it\'s\r\nmine all right. Have a look inside the back cover. There\'s my name, you\r\nsee, in perfectly good English."\r\n\r\n"Where _did_ you get it, Hal?" demanded Mrs. McGregor, as the\r\ngift traveled from one admiring hand to another.\r\n\r\n"You\'d never guess, any of you. It came from my worst enemy." The big\r\nfellow threw back his head and laughed a ringing laugh.\r\n\r\n"But that tells us nothing. You have a million enemies," blurted out\r\nCarl.\r\n\r\n"It certainly is from our friends we learn the truth," Hal replied with\r\ncheerfulness. "You\'re not a flatterer, are you, Carlie?"\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t imagine who should present you with a gold watch," Carl\r\nmused, ignoring the comment.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re not half bright to-day. What\'s the matter with you?"\r\nhectored Hal, who was enjoying the sensation he had created.\r\n\r\n"He\'s eaten too much turkey," Tim piped.\r\n\r\n"I guess that\'s it," agreed young Harling. "Come, gather your wits\r\ntogether. Louise guessed the conundrum. You ought to be as smart as she\r\nis."\r\n\r\nVaguely Carl studied his friend\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Of course it couldn\'t be from Corcoran," ventured he, as if thinking\r\naimlessly.\r\n\r\n"And why not?"\r\n\r\n"Why, because--why Corcoran wouldn\'t--why should Corcoran give you a\r\npresent like that?"\r\n\r\n"The very words I said myself!"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say it _was_ Corcoran?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it wasn\'t from Corcoran himself. But he had the buying of it.\r\nThe watch came from the Corcoran kid and Midget, the dog."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" Carl gasped, a wave of understanding flooding his face. "It was\r\nbecause of what you did that day. I\'d almost forgotten."\r\n\r\n"So had I. Corcoran thanked me up at the works some time afterward; you\r\nremember I told you about it. Well, I thought that was the end of the\r\nmatter," Hal explained. "But evidently the Corcorans thought they\r\nwouldn\'t leave it there. So--" with a flourish he held up the gift.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Hal, I think that was splendid of them," Mrs. McGregor declared.\r\n"You deserve it, too. Carl said you might have been killed that day."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! That\'s Carlie\'s yellow journalism. He told you a great yarn,\r\nI\'ve no doubt. You ought to be on one of the daily papers, kid."\r\n\r\n"But you did take an awful chance, you know you did," insisted Carl\r\nstoutly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you have to take a chance now and then to put a little spice into\r\nlife. It was no great stunt I did," Hal protested. "I just happened to\r\ndo it before anybody else did, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"I guess that\'s your way of putting it, laddie," Mrs. McGregor said\r\nwith an affectionate smile. "Well, we\'re certainly glad you have the\r\nwatch. It will be fine and useful. Just see you do not get it smashed\r\nto bits in some of the scraps you are mixed up in."\r\n\r\n"Do you think I am going to stand dumb as an oyster and let somebody\r\nland a blow over my vest pocket hard enough to smash that watch, Mrs.\r\nMcGregor?" interrogated the giant. "Pray, where would I be while he was\r\ndoing it?"\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen with gold watches should keep out of the prize ring," put in\r\nUncle Frederick mischievously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, one has to have a watch to call time on the other feller,"\r\nHal retorted.\r\n\r\n"Put it on and let\'s see how you look, Hal," Tim begged.\r\n\r\n"Yes, do!" echoed Mary.\r\n\r\n"All right, I\'ll dress up in it since you say the word," answered Hal,\r\nwith an impish grimace. "You may as well see me in it and get used to\r\nthe sight; then you won\'t be taking me for an alderman when you meet me\r\non the street."\r\n\r\nHe slipped the chain through his buttonhole and the watch into his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I look for all the world like the Lord Mayor of London or one of\r\nthe Common Council?"\r\n\r\n"You look like an old sport," Carl asserted, giving his chum a blow on\r\nthe chest.\r\n\r\nHarling accepted the knock much as a kitten might have accepted a\r\ncaress.\r\n\r\n"Just for that I\'ve half a mind not to tell you the rest of what I came\r\nfor," grinned he. "I\'ve something else to say that will set your hair\r\non end. But you\'re that rude that you don\'t deserve to be told it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what is it, Hal?" Mary cried.\r\n\r\n"Another secret!" Tim ejaculated.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t exactly a secret," Hal said. "It\'s a clue."\r\n\r\n"A clue! To what, for pity\'s sake?" Carl murmured.\r\n\r\n"You are thick, to-night--no mistake!" laughed Hal. "Why, what have we\r\nbeen arguing over all day--twisting and turning this way and that? What\r\nhave we been speculating over until our brains are weak? Tell me that?"\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t a clue about the Christmas baskets!" gasped Mrs. McGregor.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a theory," nodded Hal, with tantalizing solemnity.\r\n\r\n"Tell us! Tell us!" cried a chorus of voices.\r\n\r\n"It\'s only a theory, remember, and it doesn\'t hitch up in every\r\ndetail," went on Hal, quite serious now. "But it is worth considering."\r\n\r\n"Tell us!"\r\n\r\n"Well, it isn\'t much of a story, so don\'t get your hopes up. But the\r\nfact is that when we emptied our basket I turned it upside down----"\r\n\r\n"Because you were still hungry!" cut in Carl.\r\n\r\n"Exactly! How well you read me. Yes, being still famished, I thought\r\nI\'d see if some last morsel of food did not lurk under the papers. So I\r\nemptied out everything and what should I find scrawled in pencil across\r\nthe bottom of the basket but the word \'Coulter.\'"\r\n\r\n"_Coulter!_" shouted the McGregors in disappointed accents.\r\n\r\n"What has that to do with it?" Carl demanded.\r\n\r\n"Why"--Hal looked crestfallen--"why, Mr. Coulter of Davis and Coulter\r\nis one of my bosses, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Y-e-s, I suppose he is. But he isn\'t mine. The two baskets were\r\nexactly alike and must have come from the same person; and certainly\r\nMr. Coulter wouldn\'t send us a basket. Oh, you\'ll have to guess again,\r\nSherlock Holmes," concluded Carl with a shrug.\r\n\r\n"Your father used to work for Mr. Coulter at the mill," Mrs. McGregor\r\nput in in a subdued voice.\r\n\r\n"But Dad died two years ago and Mr. Coulter never has troubled to send\r\nus anything before. Why should he begin now?" Carl argued.\r\n\r\n"Did you examine our basket?" It was Captain Dillingham who spoke.\r\n\r\n"No, but we can. It\'s out in the pantry. Run and fetch it, Martin,\r\nthat\'s a good boy. I\'m willing to bet a hat, though, ours has no\r\n\'Coulter\' written on it. Yours got scrawled on somehow at the market.\r\nThe name doesn\'t mean anything. Here\'s Martin now. Get out your\r\nglasses, you old detective, and look and see what you can find. If you\r\ncan find Coulter on our basket, I\'ll eat my head," Carl hazarded with\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n"You hear him, witnesses," Hal said, holding up an impressive finger.\r\n\r\nThen taking the basket from Martin, he inverted it.\r\n\r\n"Will you never acknowledge, oh, you unbeliever, that I am wiser than\r\nyou?" he presently jeered. "Come! Look at the thing yourself over here\r\nunder the lamp. If that word isn\'t \'Coulter\' I\'ll eat both your head\r\nand mine."\r\n\r\n"Jove! It _is_ Coulter!" was all Carl could stammer.\r\n\r\n"What did I tell you!"\r\n\r\n"But why should Mr. Coulter send a Christmas basket to us?" speculated\r\nCarl in an awed whisper.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not telling you why. I\'ve not got as far as that," Hal answered.\r\n"All I said was that the name, Coulter, was written on both baskets and\r\nthat the natural conclusion is that Mr. Coulter was their sender."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it. Why, it would be ridiculous," Carl protested. "Mr.\r\nCoulter probably never so much as heard of us in all his life. Why\r\nshould he? I\'m sure we don\'t know him."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid your theory isn\'t quite sound, Hal," rejoined Mrs.\r\nMcGregor. "While it is possible that for some reason of his own Mr.\r\nCoulter, for whom you work, may have sent you a Christmas basket there\r\nis not one shred of anything to link him up with us. Mr. McGregor, it\r\nis true, was in Davis and Coulter\'s employ many years; but he was only\r\none of many hundred workmen and scarcely knew old Mr. Coulter by sight.\r\nSince the old gentleman has died and the son has come into the firm the\r\nlast thread that bound us to the company has been snapped. Old Mr.\r\nCoulter is gone, and McGregor, with his twenty-five years of service in\r\nthe mills, is forgotten. As for this young John Coulter who has taken\r\nhis father\'s place--I\'ve never set eyes on him."\r\n\r\n"But why should the name be on each of the baskets?" Hal insisted,\r\nstill unwilling to surrender the idea he cherished.\r\n\r\n"Ask the market man, laddie. It\'s a question for him. My notion is that\r\nin the rush somebody put it there by mistake," replied Carl\'s mother.\r\n"The marvel isn\'t that Coulter was written on the baskets; the marvel\r\nis that some word in Choctaw or Egyptian wasn\'t on \'em. Why, if you\'d\r\nseen those clerks down at the store going round as if their heads were\r\nclean off their bodies you wouldn\'t wonder queer things were written on\r\nthe hampers we got. I\'m amazed they arrived at all."\r\n\r\n"But somebody sent them," Hal affirmed.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll join you there! Somebody sent them," nodded Mrs. McGregor. "Up to\r\nthat point your arguments are perfectly logical. Those baskets never\r\ncame of themselves. But as for Mr. John Coulter being their giver--why,\r\nyou are mad as a March hare to think it for a moment. What would he be\r\ndoing with all his college education and his years of study in Europe\r\nsending the likes of us Christmas presents? He has plenty of presents\r\nto give in his own family, I guess."\r\n\r\n"Well, maybe you\'re right and the name only happened," Hal conceded.\r\n"Still, it\'s queer, isn\'t it? Queer that the name should be Coulter, I\r\nmean."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a coincidence for you because you chance to work for him; but to\r\nus it means nothing."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can see that now," Hal agreed. "Then I guess there is nothing\r\nleft before going home but to see Carlie carry out his little wager."\r\n\r\n"My wager?" Carl repeated.\r\n\r\n"You were going to eat your head if the name of Coulter was on the\r\nbottom of this basket, remember."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" Carl grinned a sickly grin.\r\n\r\n"Going to default?"\r\n\r\n"No, not default--merely postpone the ceremony," Carl declared.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you old crawler! Well, if you are going to put off the show I must\r\nbe getting home or Mother will think I have been waylaid and my watch\r\nstolen. So long, everybody, and pleasant dreams." Then thrusting his\r\nface back into the room through the narrowing crack of the door, he\r\nadded with elfish leer, "Just the same, I still think that Coulter had\r\nsomething to do with those baskets."\r\n\r\nBefore a protest could be raised the door banged and he was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nHAL REPEATS HIS VISIT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhoever the mysterious Mr. X was he succeeded in keeping his identity a\r\nsecret much better than did the donors of the O\'Dowd\'s Christmas\r\ndinner. A secret when shared by too many becomes no secret at all and\r\nso, alas, it proved in this case. And yet no deliberate prattling\r\ndivulged the story. Its betrayal was purely accidental.\r\n\r\nOn the morning following the holiday, which, by the way, chanced to be\r\nSunday, Mrs. O\'Dowd came up to borrow the McGregor\'s can opener. In\r\nMulberry Court somebody was always borrowing. An inventory of each\r\nfamily\'s possessions gradually became public property, so that all the\r\nneighbors knew exactly where to turn for anything needed. In fact, the\r\nresidents of the house so planned their purchases that they would not\r\noverlap what the dwelling already contained. Nobody thought, for\r\nexample, of buying a washing machine since the Murphys had one; nor did\r\nany one see cause for investing in a wringer, when a perfectly good one\r\nwas owned by the McGregors. Even such small things as egg beaters,\r\ndouble boilers, and ice picks, all had an established place of\r\nresidence and were used in a community spirit. All day long from\r\nmorning until night little boys and girls trailed up and down the long\r\nflights of stairs either to borrow or to return to their rightful\r\nowners articles that had been a-visiting. It almost required a card\r\ncatalogue to keep track of where one\'s things were.\r\n\r\n"Do you know who has the egg beater?" Mrs. McGregor would interrogate\r\non a baking day.\r\n\r\nAnd some of the children whose function it was to procure or carry\r\nhence the egg beater generally recalled its whereabouts.\r\n\r\n"It\'s down to Murphys\', Ma," Martin would shout. "Don\'t you remember\r\nthat Thursday she was making custard?"\r\n\r\nOh, yes; Mrs. McGregor did recollect. It flashed into her mind at the\r\ntime that with eggs so high the Murphys might well do without custard.\r\nNevertheless, she had not said so. One did not venture to criticize\r\none\'s neighbors--even if the gossip connected with the various\r\nborrowings did entail first-hand information concerning their affairs.\r\nFor by common consent it was not Mulberry Court etiquette to borrow\r\nwithout stating exactly the service required of the article in\r\nquestion. When, for instance, you sent an emissary to ask for the\r\nO\'Dowds\' ironing board you said:\r\n\r\n"Can Ma take the ironing board so she can iron out Mary\'s dress \'cause\r\nshe\'s got to have her white one clean to speak a piece in at school."\r\n\r\nThen the O\'Dowds knew exactly why the ironing board was needed and just\r\nhow necessary it was to have it, and not only did they promptly deliver\r\nit up, but the next time you met them they inquired how Mary got on\r\nspeaking her piece and whether she was frightened or not. In this way a\r\nfriendly interest was created.\r\n\r\nTo have borrowed the ironing board and not have detailed the\r\naccompanying facts would have been a heinous crime and would have\r\nexempted any person from loaning it. Under such circumstances it would\r\nhave been perfectly excusable to send back word by the messenger:\r\n\r\n"Mrs. O\'Dowd is sorry but she is using the ironing board herself\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\nBut when Mary was to speak a piece, that was quite a different matter.\r\n\r\nMulberry Court had a pride in its tenants.\r\n\r\nMary McGregor certainly must not appear in a dress that had not been\r\nfreshly ironed. Why, the people on the street would think Mulberry\r\nCourt bereft of all sense of propriety! No, indeed. Mary McGregor must\r\nmake a fitting showing if the whole house had to turn to to achieve the\r\ndesired result. And if by any chance her family could not iron her\r\ndress, why somebody else must. Mulberry Court would make a proper\r\nshowing no matter at what personal sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAnd the same self-respecting spirit came to the fore on all great\r\noccasions. When the Sullivan\'s baby was christened was not Mrs.\r\nSullivan arrayed in Mrs. McGregor\'s bonnet, Mrs. O\'Dowd\'s coat, and\r\nMrs. Murphy\'s skirt, that she might make a truly genteel impression?\r\nThere was the dignity of Mulberry Court to be maintained.\r\n\r\nThus it followed that borrowing was no unusual act and therefore when\r\non Sunday morning Mrs. O\'Dowd presented herself at the McGregor\'s door\r\nand announced that she was going to have a chowder of canned corn for\r\ndinner and wanted the can opener, beyond a conversation as to the\r\nnourishment corn chowder contained; the brand of canned goods one\r\nbought; the price of it per can; the quantity of milk required and the\r\nprice of that milk per quart, nothing further was said, unless it was,\r\nperhaps, to mention the crackers and inquire whether the O\'Dowds used\r\npilot biscuit or oysterettes. But of course the can opener was not\r\ndenied and while Mary went to fetch it and Mrs. McGregor continued\r\ncutting Nell\'s hair Mrs. O\'Dowd, with arms akimbo, reviewed the\r\npleasures of the day before and compared Christmas dinners.\r\n\r\n"Such a feast as we had," declared she. "Such turkey! It melted in your\r\nmouth and ran down your throat almost before you had the chance to\r\ntaste it. And the sweet potatoes! You\'d believe, actually, they were\r\njust dug up out of the ground! Had you sweet potatoes in your basket,\r\nMartin?"\r\n\r\n"Sure we had!" returned the small boy, not to be outdone.\r\n\r\n"And then the celery! It was that handsome it was fit to be set on a\r\nbonnet--I\'m telling you the truth."\r\n\r\n"Mary gave the celery," lisped Nell.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" Martin cried. "You weren\'t to tell that."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t tell what I gave. Ma told me not to and I haven\'t," announced\r\nwee Nell proudly.\r\n\r\n"But you\'re not to tell what anybody gave," Martin commanded. "I\r\nhaven\'t told a thing, have I, Ma?" concluded he in triumph.\r\n\r\n"Hush, Martin, hush!" cautioned his mother quickly. "Pay no heed to\r\nthem, Mrs. O\'Dowd; sure after the holiday they hardly know what they\'re\r\nsaying."\r\n\r\n"But--but----" Mrs. O\'Dowd glanced keenly about, viewing the guilty\r\nfaces and the indignant looks the older children centered on the two\r\nsmall culprits. She was a quick-witted woman and instantly put two and\r\ntwo together.\r\n\r\n"So it was Mary sent the celery, was it?" repeated she. "And who, pray,\r\nbought the turkey?" The temptation the question presented was too great\r\nfor the youthful conspirators.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Fwedewic! Uncle Fwedewic!" cried Nell and Martin in a breath.\r\n\r\n"He bought it wiz his very own money," Nell went on to explain before\r\nshe could be stopped.\r\n\r\nOh, the game was all up now! Of what use was it to pretend anything\r\nafter that? Martin heaved a sigh of delight. For days the secret had\r\ntrembled on his tongue, making life uncomfortable and unnatural.\r\nConstitutionally it was his habit to let slip from that artless member\r\nanything that lurked at its tip and as a result he held secrets in\r\nabhorrence. Now the truth was out and he for one was glad it was. He\r\nwould no longer be dreading an encounter with the O\'Dowds or be under\r\nthe trying necessity of acting a part.\r\n\r\n"The candy was mine," he announced calmly. "I gave it and Uncle\r\nFrederick paid the man."\r\n\r\nJulie ventured over the threshold.\r\n\r\n"So it\'s you we have to thank for our dinner!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t have us to _thank_," put in Mrs. McGregor quickly.\r\n\r\n"But you surely wouldn\'t have me be taking a dinner like that and not\r\nthanking you for it," said Julie. "And neither O\'Dowd nor I had an\r\ninkling! Think of our coming up here Christmas morning and all of you\r\nkeeping so mum!"\r\n\r\n"We\'d have kept mum longer, if it hadn\'t been for Nell and Martin,"\r\nCarl asserted. "I don\'t see why they couldn\'t shut up, Ma."\r\n\r\n"A secret\'s no easy treasure to have in one\'s possession," Mrs. O\'Dowd\r\nput in quickly. "And you must remember they are but mites--Nell and\r\nMartin. Indeed, in my opinion, it\'s a miracle they didn\'t blurt it out\r\nlong before this. You wouldn\'t get a child of mine to hold his peace\r\nany such while; neither the big ones nor the little could do it. Well,\r\nwell! It was a happy day you gave us and you certainly deserved the\r\ndinner you got yourselves. And you had no notion when you sent ours you\r\nwere to have one of your own."\r\n\r\n"No! When it came we thought for a moment you had sent our present\r\nback," Carl explained.\r\n\r\n"In other words, you were going without your dinner to give it to us,"\r\ncommented Julie.\r\n\r\n"We had our tree," Mary interrupted. "We didn\'t need both things."\r\n\r\n"It\'s few would have done what you did," Julie remarked quietly.\r\n"O\'Dowd and I will not be forgetting it, either."\r\n\r\nTears came into the eyes of the little woman and as if words failed her\r\nshe wheeled about and disappeared down the dim hallway.\r\n\r\n"At least, she was not put out by our doing it," commented Mrs.\r\nMcGregor, after her neighbor had gone. "I feared some she might be. But\r\nevidently she accepted the gift just as we meant it. So that\'s settled!\r\nNow if we could only find out where our own dinner came from and say as\r\nmuch to its giver, I\'d be entirely content. I\'ve taxed my brain until\r\nmy head is fair aching and still I\'m no nearer having an idea where\r\nthat basket of ours came from than the man in the moon."\r\n\r\n"I guess you will just have to rate it as coming from the fairies,"\r\nsmiled her brother, "and let the matter rest there; that is, unless Hal\r\nHarling gets another inspiration."\r\n\r\n"Another inspiration! Sure the inspiration he had wasn\'t worth much,"\r\nsniffed Mrs. McGregor. "Unless he can provide a better one than that I\r\nsha\'n\'t be listening to him."\r\n\r\n"You may as well not be slandering him, for here he is now," Carl\r\ncried, jumping up to admit his chum whose footfall he had heard on the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not slandering him," Mrs. McGregor continued, imperturbably\r\ngreeting the visitor. "In fact, what I\'ve said about him I\'d as lief\r\nsay to his face. I\'m telling them, laddie," said she, turning brightly\r\nto Hal, "that I have scant opinion of you as a detective."\r\n\r\nThe big fellow laughed good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n"They are not putting me on the Scotland Yard force yet, I must own,"\r\nhe admitted. "But how do you know that I won\'t track down Mr. X yet?\r\nGive me time. No great mystery can be solved all in a minute."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve let you sleep on it and so far as I can see you are no better off\r\nthis morning than you were last night," was the crisp retort.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not, and that\'s the truth," Hal returned, pulling off his coat.\r\n"I\'m simply going to bury the matter the way a dog buries a bone, and\r\nthen some day I\'ll dig it up and go to work at it again."\r\n\r\n"I guess that\'s as good a scheme as any," Captain Dillingham declared.\r\n"Sometimes if you do not fuss at a riddle it solves itself. Come, sit\r\ndown and talk to us while Nell gets her hair cut. It may help to keep\r\nher quiet."\r\n\r\nThe child, seated on the table and muffled to her neck in her mother\'s\r\napron, brightened.\r\n\r\n"Tell story," commanded she. "Hal tell story."\r\n\r\n"I? Not on your life!" protested the big fellow in consternation. "I\r\nnever told a story in all my days. Your uncle Frederick will tell you\r\none."\r\n\r\n"Uncle Frederick will do nothing of the sort," growled the captain, as\r\nhe puffed contentedly at his pipe. "It\'s Hal who is going to tell the\r\nstory. He is going to explain to us exactly what they do with the bales\r\nof cotton when they reach the mill."\r\n\r\n"That? Oh, I can tell you that, all right, for I see it done from\r\nmorning to night, year in and year out. But I don\'t call that a story,\r\ndo you?"\r\n\r\n"It will be a story to us, no matter what it is to you, for remember\r\nthat although I have often loaded cotton and carried it hither and\r\nthither round the world I\'ve never seen what became of it after we\r\nthumped it down on the dock."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you? That\'s funny!" smiled Hal. "And yet after all I don\'t\r\nknow as it is, either. How should you know what is done with it? I\r\nshouldn\'t have if I hadn\'t happened to spend my days at Davis and\r\nCoulter\'s. Well, then, as soon as we get the bales we first weigh them\r\nand make a record of each. Then they are opened up and the matted\r\nmaterial is spread out so the coarsest of the dirt, such as leaves,\r\nsand, stems, and bits of dry pods will be loosened and fall out. To\r\naccomplish this we have opening machines of various kinds with beaters,\r\nfans, and rollers and by these methods the cotton is cleaned and\r\npressed into a flat sheet or lap. Afterward we start in to mix the\r\nvarieties in the different bales."\r\n\r\n"What for?" questioned Carl.\r\n\r\n"Oh, because to get good results you have to have a blend of\r\nvarieties," Hal explained.\r\n\r\n"But isn\'t cotton cotton?" inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit it isn\'t," grinned young Harling. "Some cotton is far and\r\naway better than another. Often it has had better care, better weather,\r\nor better soil; or maybe it has grown more evenly and therefore has\r\nless unripe stuff mixed in with it. Or perhaps it was a finer, more\r\nhighly cultivated kind in the first place. There are a score of\r\nexplanations. Anyhow it is better, and because it is we do not use it\r\nall by itself. Instead we use it to grade up some that is less fine in\r\nquality. After the bales have been classified we take a little of this\r\nand a little of that until we have struck a good average. It goes\r\nwithout saying that we never mix two extremes, or put the best and the\r\nworst together. That wouldn\'t do at all. We aim to produce a mean\r\nbetween these two qualities. All this mixing is not, however, done by\r\nhand, as you might think to hear me talk. No, indeed! We have\r\nbale-breakers or cotton-pullers to do the work. We simply put several\r\nsheets or laps of different quality cotton one on top of another and\r\nthen let the spikes of the machines tear it into fragments and mix it\r\nup."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" Mary murmured.\r\n\r\n"Afterward comes the scutching," went on Hal, "which is really only a\r\ncontinuation of the same process although the scutching machine makes\r\nthe laps of cotton of more even thickness. Next we card the material to\r\nfind out where we stand. It is brushed or combed out--whichever you\r\nprefer to call it, and the remaining dirt and short, unripe fibers are\r\nremoved. This leaves the real thing, and the machine gathers it up and\r\ntwists it into a sort of rope about an inch in diameter called a\r\nsliver."\r\n\r\n"What a funny name!" Tim remarked.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is when you stop to think of it," Hal answered. "Well,\r\nanyhow, that\'s what a sliver is. In some mills they draw the cotton out\r\ninto these long strands and double together four or eight slivers\r\nbefore they are carded. The carding lengthens or stretches them to the\r\nsize of one and therefore you get a greater uniformity of size. Beside\r\nthat, all the crossed or snarled fibers are arranged so that they lie\r\nout straight and smooth, and when this is done the material is ready\r\nfor the bobbin and fly frames."\r\n\r\n"And what, for goodness\' sake, might those be?" demanded Captain\r\nDillingham.\r\n\r\n"I certainly am a great hero coming here and knowing so much," Hal\r\nanswered with amusement. "I think you will understand them better, sir,\r\nif you forget what they\'re called and remember only what they do. They\r\nactually combine three processes: slubbing, intermediate, and roving,\r\nand their aim is to draw the sliver out until it is thinner, more\r\nuniform, and cleaner for spinning. Surely that is simple enough. The\r\nspinning is done on a mule or a ring frame--sometimes the one is\r\npreferred, sometimes the other. Generally speaking, the thread from one\r\nof these machines is what is used for weaving purposes. Sometimes,\r\nthough, it happens that an order comes for a crackajack fine yarn of\r\nthe best possible quality and then another combing or carding process\r\nfollows which takes out everything shorter than fibers of a specified\r\nlength. As a result about seventeen per cent. of waste is thrown out,\r\nas great a percentage as in all the other processes put together.\r\nNaturally it is a pretty expensive operation and it makes the yarn thus\r\nturned out high in price."\r\n\r\n"I suppose such yarn goes only into the finest quality goods," observed\r\nCaptain Dillingham.\r\n\r\n"Exactly!" was Hal\'s answer.\r\n\r\n"It all sounds simple as rolling off a log," Carl affirmed.\r\n\r\n"If it seems so to you, just you think back over the problem Arkwright\r\nand some of the other inventors, the fruit of whose labors we are now\r\nreaping, had to solve," put in Uncle Frederick. "Even I, who am\r\nignorant as an Egyptian mummy concerning cotton manufacture, can\r\nappreciate to some extent what they were up against. You must remember\r\nthat no material is stronger than its weakest part. You have, for\r\ninstance, a thin place in a string; it matters not how strong that\r\nstring may be in other spots; pull it taut and it will snap. The thick\r\nplaces do not help make the string strong as a whole. So it is with\r\nthread. You have to draw it out until every portion of it is as strong\r\nas every other--a pretty little conundrum! It is the drawing, twisting,\r\nand doubling which makes the thread first uniform and then strong. Try\r\nworking-out devices that shall do all these things--devices that shall\r\ntwist and then double without untwisting, for example. You\'ll find it\r\nworse than a three-ringed circus."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, sir!" Hal agreed heartily. "I remember when I first went\r\ninto the mills how puzzled I was at seeing the bobbins whirling in\r\nopposite directions. It seemed as if one was simply undoing what\r\nanother had done. I thought they all ought to turn the same way. It was\r\nmonths before I got through my head what they were up to."\r\n\r\n"I hadn\'t thought of the twisting and doubling part," Carl murmured.\r\n\r\n"You decide with that thrown in maybe the answer to the puzzle isn\'t so\r\neasy, eh?" responded Hal with a teasing smile.\r\n\r\n"I might have to ponder over it," Carl confessed suavely.\r\n\r\n"Ponder! I guess you would. What\'s more, you\'d have a good smart\r\nheadache before you were through your _pondering_, I\'ll bet!" jeered\r\nHal, tweaking his chum\'s hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSPINNING YARNS\r\n\r\n\r\nAll good things, alas, come to an end and the McGregor\'s Christmas\r\nholidays were no exception to this immutable law. A day arrived when\r\nCarl, Mary and Tim were obliged to return to school, and following\r\nswift on the heels of this dire occasion came a yet more lamentable one\r\nwhen Uncle Frederick Dillingham was forced to go back to his ship and\r\nsail for China. The latter calamity entirely overshadowed the former\r\nand was a very real blow not only to Mulberry Court, where the captain\r\nhad become an object of universal pride and affection, but also to the\r\nHarling family who had come to depend on his daily visits for cheer and\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why somebody else can\'t sail your ship to China, Uncle\r\nFrederick, and let you stay here," wailed Mary.\r\n\r\n"Somebody else sail my ship!" gasped the captain, every syllable of the\r\nphrase echoing consternation. "Why, my dear child, I would no more turn\r\nthe command of the _Charlotte_ over to another person than you would\r\nexchange your mother for somebody else\'s. The _Charlotte_ kind of\r\nbelongs to me, don\'t you see? She is my--well, I reckon I can\'t just\r\nexplain what she is. All I can say is that where she goes I go--if I am\r\nalive."\r\n\r\n"But--but the sea is so terrible," objected the timid Mary. "So\r\ndangerous."\r\n\r\nFor answer Captain Dillingham burst into a peal of laughter.\r\n\r\n"Dangerous? Why, lassie, there isn\'t a quarter a part the danger on the\r\nwater there is on land. I have come nearer to being killed right here\r\nin Baileyville than ever I have while cruising in mid-ocean. Folks take\r\ntheir lives in their hands every time they cross a city street. Then,\r\ntoo, aren\'t there high buildings to topple over; flagpoles to snap\r\nasunder, signs to blow down; chimneys to shower their bricks on your\r\nhead; not to mention the death-dealing currents that come through\r\ntelegraph and telephone wires? Add to this threatening collection trees\r\nand snow-slides and slippery pavements and you have quite a list of\r\nhorrors. Danger! Why, the land is nothing but maelstrom of catastrophes\r\ncompared with which the serenity of the open sea, with nothing but its\r\nmoon and stars overhead, is an oasis of safety. Of course there are\r\ncertain things you must be on your guard against while on the\r\nwater--fogs, icebergs and gales. But where can you find a spot under\r\nGod\'s heaven entirely free from the possibilities of mishap of some\r\nsort? I\'d a hundred times rather take the risks the sea holds than run\r\nmy chances on land. Besides, aren\'t we a city, same as you? Just\r\nbecause we are afloat and you can boast the solid ground under your\r\nfeet is it a sign we are not citizens with laws and duties? with the\r\nwireless singing its messages to us wherever we go we certainly are not\r\ncut off from the rest of the world."\r\n\r\nFor a moment he paused to catch his breath.\r\n\r\n"No, siree!" continued he. "We folks on shipboard simply belong to a\r\nfloating republic, that\'s all. It\'s our country same as this is yours,\r\nand we love it quite as much as you do."\r\n\r\n"I never thought of the ocean that way," Mary returned with a\r\nthoughtful smile. "It\'s always seemed to me a big, big place without\r\nany--any streets or----"\r\n\r\n"But we have streets, lassie," cried her uncle, instantly catching her\r\nup. "Regular avenues they are. Travel \'em and you\'ll meet the passing\r\nsame as you would were you to drive along a boulevard. They are the\r\nocean highways, the latitudes and longitudes found to be the best paths\r\nbetween given countries. In some cases the way chosen is shorter; or\r\nmaybe experience has proved it to be freer from fog or icebergs.\r\nAnyhow, it has become an accepted thoroughfare and is as familiar to\r\nseafaring men as if it had been smoothed down with a steam roller and\r\nhad a signpost set to mark it. Never think, child, of the ocean as a\r\nlonely, uncharted waste of water. It is a nice quiet place with as much\r\nsociability on it as a man wants. You don\'t, to be sure, rub elbows\r\nwith your neighbors as you do ashore; but on the other hand you don\'t\r\nhave to put up with their racket. Pleasant as it is to be on land the\r\nhum of it gets on my nerves in time, and I am always thankful to be\r\nback aboard ship."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll miss you dreadfully, Frederick," his sister remarked.\r\n\r\n"But remember I\'ll be putting in at various ports off and on," returned\r\nthe captain, "and be mailing you letters, postals and trinkets of one\r\nsort and another. Moreover, you\'re all going to write to me, I\r\nhope--even Martin. For if there\'s any one thing a sailor man looks\r\nforward to it\'s the mail that awaits him in a foreign port. I must own\r\nthat with all the virtues the sea possesses the landlubber has the best\r\nof us on mail service. Rural free delivery is one blessing we can\'t\r\nboast. No blue-coated postmen come sauntering down our watery streets\r\nto drop letters and papers into our boxes. We have to call for these\r\nourselves same as you might have to go to a post-office here ashore if\r\nthe government wasn\'t as thoughtful and generous as it is. Our\r\npost-offices are sometimes pretty far apart, too, and I\'m driven to\r\nconfess we don\'t always get our mail as often as we\'d like. That\'s one\r\nof the outs of seafaring. So when we do touch shore and go looking for\r\nletters it is disappointing not to find any. Don\'t forget that. After\r\nI\'m gone you will get busy with your school, and your sewing, and your\r\nfun, and you will not think so often about Uncle Frederick." He put up\r\na warning hand to stay the protest of his listeners. "You won\'t mean\r\nto," continued he kindly, "but you\'ll do it all the same. It\'s human\r\nnature."\r\n\r\nThis sinister prediction, however, did not prove true.\r\n\r\nFor days after Captain Dillingham said good-by to Baileyville, Mulberry\r\nCourt, the Harlings and the McGregors were inconsolable.\r\n\r\n"The house isn\'t the same with Uncle Frederick gone, is it, Mother?"\r\ncommented Mary.\r\n\r\n"No, it isn\'t. We miss him very much."\r\n\r\n"I should say we did! Such a lot of things happen all the time that I\r\nwant to tell him," Carl broke in. "Why, only this morning the teacher\r\ngave me a book to look up something and the first page I opened to had\r\na lot about foreign trade. A month ago I wouldn\'t have cast my eye over\r\nit a second time but now, because of Uncle Frederick, that sort of\r\nthing interests me. So I read along down the left-hand column and what\r\nshould it be about but the first spinning mills! I wished Uncle\r\nFrederick could have read it."\r\n\r\n"You must write him about it," flashed Mary. "What did it say, Carl?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," her brother answered awkwardly. "I\'m not sure that\r\nI can remember exactly. I wasn\'t learning it to recite."\r\n\r\n"But you read it, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Sure I did, Miss Schoolmarm!"\r\n\r\n"Then you must remember some of it," Mary persisted.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I remember scraps of it. It said at the outset that nobody really\r\nknew when people began to spin. Most likely they got the idea from\r\npulling out fibers of cotton or wool long as they could make them with\r\ntheir fingers, and then twisting the stuff together into larger and\r\nlonger threads. As they could do this better if they had the end\r\nfastened to something, they got the notion of using a stick or some\r\nsort of spool or spindle to wind the thread up on as they made it. They\r\nwould go walking round with a mass of material under one arm and this\r\ncrude spindle with the thread on it under the other. The book said that\r\neven now in certain foreign countries there were peasants who did this.\r\nIt was during the reign of Henry VII that spindles and distaffs first\r\nappeared in England. Afterward people improved on the idea and made\r\nspinning wheels. The people of India had had these long before, so you\r\nsee they weren\'t really new; but they were new to England. To judge\r\nfrom the book they weren\'t any great shakes of spinning wheels; still\r\nthey were better than nothing. Later on the English got finer ones such\r\nas were used in Savoy and these not only had a spindle but a flyer and\r\nbobbin. It was most likely these Saxony wheels that started inventors\r\ntrying to make something that would be better yet."\r\n\r\nHolding the plug he was whittling for his double-runner up to the\r\nlight, Carl halted.\r\n\r\n"I think you\'ve done pretty well, son," remarked his mother over the\r\ntop of her sewing.\r\n\r\n"I think so too," Carl returned with unaffected candor. "I had no idea\r\nwhen I started that I could remember so much. I guess it was because I\r\nwas interested in the story and wasn\'t trying to learn it. When you\r\nthink you\'re learning things, you get to saying them over and over\r\nuntil by and by what little sense there is in \'em seems to evaporate.\r\nAt least, that\'s the way it is with me. If I could just read and not\r\nkeep thinking that I was trying to learn I\'d get on twice as well. Even\r\nthis page of stuff would have _looked_ different if I\'d been going to\r\nlearn it. You see, you never have the chance to learn what you want to\r\nat school; it\'s always what they pick out for you. Naturally you don\'t\r\ncare as much about it as you would if it was what you\'d chosen\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nMrs. McGregor could not resist smiling in sympathy with this philosophy\r\nof education, novel as it was.\r\n\r\n"Now what the teacher sent me to look up in that book," went on Carl,\r\n"was some old foreign treaty. Of course I read it over because she made\r\nme. But do I remember a line of it? Nix! I told her what the book said\r\nas fast as I could, so to get it off my soul before I forgot it. I\r\ndon\'t see what she cared about it for anyway, for it didn\'t seem to\r\nhitch up to anything. But this spinning business hitched right up to\r\nUncle Frederick, Hal Harling and what we\'ve been talking about. I don\'t\r\nsee why Miss Dewey couldn\'t have let me alone to learn about that."\r\n\r\n"Probably she didn\'t dream you were interested in it," said Mary. "How\r\nshould she, pray?"\r\n\r\n"I know it. I suppose she didn\'t," answered Carl with fairness. "She\r\ncertainly is no mind reader; and I didn\'t mention it."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t go blaming poor Miss Dewey," Mary retorted. "Besides, what\r\nkind of a school would she have if every child in it refused to learn\r\nanything but what he cared about. She would have fifty kids all going\r\nfifty different ways."\r\n\r\nCarl sighed. Plainly the flaws of the educational system were too many\r\nfor him. Nevertheless he attempted a modest defense of his theory.\r\n\r\n"No, she wouldn\'t," contradicted he. "Some of \'em don\'t want to learn\r\nanything anyhow, and since they have to they are as well pleased to\r\nlearn one thing as another. Billie Tarbox, for instance, hasn\'t any\r\npreferences; he just hates all highbrow stuff alike. And the Murphys\r\nand Jack Sullivan wouldn\'t care a hurrah what they learned. All Jack\r\nwants to do when he grows up is to run a steam roller and if he can do\r\nthat he\'ll be perfectly satisfied."\r\n\r\n"But he\'ll have to learn something before he can," observed Mrs.\r\nMcGregor.\r\n\r\n"No, he won\'t, Ma. Mike Finnerty who lives in his block runs one and he\r\ndoesn\'t know a thing," Carl replied simply.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I think you\'ll find Mr. Michael Finnerty knows much\r\nmore than you give him credit for," retorted Mrs. McGregor. "He\r\nprobably knows more than he himself realizes. He may not have learned\r\nabout engines out of books; but if not he has learned about them from\r\nactual contact with them. All learning does not come from between book\r\ncovers, sonny. Experience is a wonderful teacher. Books simply give us\r\nthe same result without making us stumble along to learn everything\r\nourselves. They are somebody else\'s experience done up in a little\r\nbundle and handed to us as a shorter cut. Mr. Michael Finnerty has had\r\nto take the long way round to get his education, that is all. For\r\neducation is nothing but a training which enables us to live and be\r\nuseful to others; and if when we\'re through we can\'t do that all the\r\nbook learning in the world isn\'t going to be worth much to us."\r\n\r\n"Why, Mother, I thought you were terribly keen on schools," ejaculated\r\nMary, aghast.\r\n\r\n"So I am, my dear. A fine mind thoroughly trained is a glorious tool;\r\nbut far too often people forget that it is simply a tool. Just\r\nsharpening and polishing it and never turning it to account for other\r\npeople isn\'t what it was made for. Learn all you can so you will be\r\nable to help the world along the better. But don\'t just soak up and\r\nsoak up what books tell you and then store it away in your head like so\r\nmuch old lumber."\r\n\r\n"But what can you do with what you read, Ma?" Carl questioned, laying\r\ndown his whittling and facing his mother.\r\n\r\n"Precisely what you have been doing this morning, for one thing," was\r\nthe quiet answer. "Pass it on to somebody else who hasn\'t read it. Mary\r\nand I, for example, hadn\'t read about England and the early spinning\r\nwheels. We hadn\'t the time to; nor had we the book. You\'ve managed to\r\ntell us quite a lot."\r\n\r\n"Maybe I could tell you some more, if you wanted me to," said Carl,\r\nurged on by altruistic impulse.\r\n\r\n"Of course we do," his mother replied.\r\n\r\nCarl took a long breath and considered thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Well, what knocked me was that at first the English government didn\'t\r\nwant any cotton cloth made," began he.\r\n\r\n"Why not? I should think they would have been delighted!" Mary put in.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the English made a lot of woolen goods, and they had a hunch that\r\ncotton cloth might cut into the trade for wool and fustians. So\r\nParliament passed a law placing a five-pound fine on any of the British\r\nwho wore things made of colored calico. As the restriction also covered\r\nthe use of painted, dyed or stenciled cottons it knocked out all these\r\nproducts for hangings, bedspreads, or coverings."\r\n\r\n"How horrid of them!" said Mary indignantly.\r\n\r\n"They were darned afraid of their trade being interfered with, you\r\nsee," explained her brother. "I believe you could use an all blue\r\ncalico and of course there was no objection to making cotton cloth into\r\nunderclothes; also you were allowed to use a cloth woven of cotton and\r\nwool. But you mustn\'t wear any pretty figured cotton dresses. When the\r\npeople heard that they kind of rose up, and when the government found\r\nout they wouldn\'t stand for such a law, in 1736, after amending it,\r\nthey made another one letting folks wear any kind of decorated cloth\r\nthey had a mind to, so long as its warp was entirely of linen yarn.\r\nThis provided England with a market for her flax. But once the law was\r\npassed the delighted manufacturers began to turn out colored cloth by\r\nthe bushelful, making any amount more than they could sell just because\r\nthey were allowed to. This led to another difficulty--where were they\r\ngoing to get enough linen warp? The cottagers who worked at home with\r\ntheir little spinning wheels could not begin to turn out the supply\r\nthat was needed, and weavers of cloth went traveling everywhere over\r\nEngland buying up all the linen thread people would sell and begging\r\nfor more. And not only did they want linen warp but they wanted it\r\nstronger and coarser so they could weave heavier cloth. Now the\r\nspinning wheels only turned out single thread. What was to be done?"\r\n\r\n"Well, what was to be done?" echoed Mary.\r\n\r\n"It was trying to find an answer to all this weaving muddle that set\r\nJohn Kay to inventing his flying shuttle," replied Carl. "Until then it\r\nhad taken two people to send the heavy shuttles with the warp on them\r\nacross the looms. His new flying shuttle did the same work with only\r\none person to operate it. You\'d think that an improvement in weaving,\r\nwouldn\'t you; and you\'d have the right, if you worked out the idea, to\r\nbelieve the weavers would be pleased?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," returned his mother.\r\n\r\n"Well, instead of being pleased, the workmen were crazy," Carl\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because they were such blockheads they were afraid Kay\'s invention was\r\ngoing to put them out of their jobs. In fact, they got so soured on\r\npoor old Kay that his life was actually in danger and he had to get out\r\nof England. There\'s gratitude for you!" concluded the boy with a shrug.\r\n\r\n"But later on they learned better, I suppose, and sent for him to come\r\nback," Mary suggested. "That\'s the way people always do."\r\n\r\n"These people didn\'t," was Carl\'s grim retort. "Not on your tin-type!\r\nThey never got Kay back again in spite of all he\'d done for them.\r\nInstead, he died somewhere abroad without receiving much of anything\r\nfor his invention. Wouldn\'t that make you hot? In the meantime, about\r\n1738, a chap called Lewis Paul got out a double set of rollers that\r\nwould draw out thread and twist it--a stunt previously done by hand. So\r\nit went. Here and there men all over England, knowing the need of\r\nbetter spinning devices, went to it to see what they could do. John\r\nWyatt, who, like Paul, was a Birmingham native, tried spinning by means\r\nof rollers; and for ever so long it was a question whether it was he or\r\nPaul who should be credited with the invention of the roller and flyer\r\nmachine. After twenty years I believe Paul was granted the patent. In\r\npoint of fact, though, Arkwright thirty years before had tried to get a\r\npatent on spinning by rollers, and no doubt both Lewis Paul and John\r\nWyatt got the suggestion from him. Anyhow, the idea spread like\r\nwildfire and immediately no end of people went to work fussing with\r\nrollers, flyers, and spindles. As a result, many small things were\r\nadded to improve the spinning contrivances in use at the time. Then in\r\n1764, or thereabouts, along came James Hargreaves, a Lancashire\r\nEnglishman, with a machine that would spin eleven threads at once."\r\n\r\nHis listeners gave a little gasp.\r\n\r\n"That was some stride ahead, wasn\'t it?" commented Carl, as proudly as\r\nif he himself had done the deed. "Yes, siree! Hargreaves\'s spinning\r\njenny was a big step forward. And as usual it raised a row. When he got\r\nit all perfected five years later and went to take out a patent on it,\r\nhis right to it was questioned and his life made miserable. But,\r\nanyhow, people couldn\'t say he built on Arkwright or Paul, for whether\r\nthey liked it or not they had to admit his idea was quite new. His\r\njenny only spun cloth rovings, however. The rovings had to be prepared\r\nfirst; that is, the cotton had to be carded and given its first twist.\r\nAfter that Hargreaves was ready for it and could lengthen, twist, and\r\nspin into yarn eleven threads of it."\r\n\r\n"I hope the ungrateful workmen did not get after him as they did after\r\nJohn Kay," Mary murmured.\r\n\r\n"They did! At least, although they did not drive him out of England\r\nthey drove him out of Lancashire. So he went to Nottingham; and after\r\narming himself with his patent he and a Mr. James built a spinning mill\r\nthere, one of the first to be built in England."\r\n\r\n"That must have made his fortune and repaid him for all his hard\r\nlabor," remarked Mrs. McGregor, as she held up a violet cloud of\r\nspangled tulle and examined it critically.\r\n\r\n"The book said he didn\'t make much money," Carl announced. "He wasn\'t\r\nas poor as John Kay and did not die in want; but he certainly never\r\nbecame rich."\r\n\r\n"I suppose now that they had spinning factories England was satisfied,"\r\nsaid Mary.\r\n\r\n"Satisfied?" repeated Carl with scorn. "Satisfied because there was one\r\nlittle measly spinning factory? You bet your life people weren\'t\r\nsatisfied! To be sure some of the hardest of the inventing was done.\r\nBut don\'t for a minute imagine you are through with Richard Arkwright.\r\nHe was still on the job."\r\n\r\n"You told us about him before."\r\n\r\n"Trying to get a patent on spinning by rollers? Yes, I did. Well, he\r\nwas still alive and of course when everybody was talking about spinning\r\nhe couldn\'t help hearing the gossip even if he did happen to be a\r\nbarber. In fact while he traveled round buying and selling hair for\r\nwigs he must have met no end of people and talked with them, so I guess\r\nhe heard more of the news of the day than did lots of other men.\r\nBarbers always seem to be sociable chaps. He was quite a mechanic, too,\r\nin his way; machinery had always interested him."\r\n\r\n"In spite of his making wigs and toupees for ladies and gentlemen?"\r\nlaughed Mrs. McGregor mischievously.\r\n\r\n"Sure, Ma! He had been born in Lancashire just as Hargreaves had and so\r\nhe probably was particularly interested in Hargreaves. When anybody\r\nfrom your own part of the world does anything smart you always are all\r\nears about it, you know. So Arkwright found out all he could by\r\ngossiping about Hargreaves\'s spinning jenny, and no one was quicker to\r\nsee what such an invention would mean to England than he. The idea was\r\nalmost like a magnet to him. He hunted up Mr. Highs, who had\r\nexperimented a lot with spinning machinery, and talked with him; he\r\nalso met John Kay, who at one time had helped Highs. And because he was\r\nsuch an intelligent listener and seemed to understand machinery so well\r\nthese men babbled to him about their hobby. Having heard all they had\r\nto say Arkwright went off by himself and set quietly to work to try out\r\non a small scale certain notions of his own. These notions had to do\r\nwith spinning cotton by drawing rollers, and they worked perfectly.\r\nThat was enough for him. He announced his success, got his patent, was\r\nknighted by the crown, and became rich. How\'s that for a yarn? Isn\'t it\r\nlike the story of Puss-In-Boots?"\r\n\r\n"It is certainly magical," declared Mrs. McGregor, who had dropped her\r\nwork in her absorption. "I am glad, too, to know there was one inventor\r\nwho prospered."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid he was the only one--at least of those interested in\r\nspinning," replied Carl gravely.\r\n\r\n"All the others both before and after him lost out so far as money\r\nwent."\r\n\r\n"Who did come after Arkwright?" queried Mary.\r\n\r\n"Crompton--Samuel Crompton," was the prompt reply. "He was a little boy\r\nwhen Arkwright was tooting round the country trading hair and wigs. The\r\ntwo men may even have happened to see one another somewhere. That\r\nwouldn\'t be impossible, you know. Anyway, during the time that\r\nArkwright was fighting the right to his roller patent; going into\r\npartnership with rich men who could finance his schemes; and building\r\nhis chain of mills at Nottingham, Cromford, and Matlock, Crompton was\r\ngrowing up. As some of these mills were worked by horse power and some\r\nby water power, the name of \'water frame\' clung to Arkwright\'s\r\ninvention. Crompton, like everybody else who lived at the time, saw the\r\nrivalry between Hargreaves\'s jenny and Arkwright\'s water frame. It was\r\nof course silly that there should have been rivalry, for the two\r\nmachines did quite different sorts of work. Arkwright\'s water frame was\r\nbetter for making the warp and long threads of cloth; and Hargreaves\'s\r\njenny turned out better weft, or the kind of thread that went from side\r\nto side. It was only a matter of the sort of thread you needed,\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\n"Then they certainly needn\'t have been jealous of one another,"\r\ncommented Mrs. McGregor.\r\n\r\n"Fortunately in time they found that out and realized that each loom\r\nhad its advantages; to-day both are used--one for one purpose, one for\r\nanother. But no matter how many enemies Arkwright had everybody,\r\nwhether they liked him or not, was compelled to admit that he gave the\r\nspinning industry a tremendous boost and did more toward starting our\r\npresent factory idea than did any one else. Not only was he a tireless\r\nworker, but he was quick as a flash to see what was needed. Maybe he\r\nwasn\'t any too scrupulous whose property he took; but at least he took\r\nthe things he seized more for the public good than his own, I really\r\nbelieve. For instance, there was Lewis Paul\'s carding engine; he\r\nintroduced that into Lancashire and added to it a stripping comb, or\r\ndoffer, that made it about fifty per cent. better than it ever had been\r\nbefore. That is what he did to everything he touched. He swooped down\r\non any machine he saw and then proceeded to improve it. It didn\'t\r\nmatter to him who it belonged to. Of course you can\'t do that, even if\r\nyou are an inventor," grinned Carl. "Naturally it got Arkwright in\r\nwrong and he was given some pretty hard names. Still he did a lot of\r\ngood for all that. And, anyway, whatever he was, I take my hat off to\r\nhim because he began to study writing, spelling, and arithmetic when he\r\nwas fifty years old. That gets me!"\r\n\r\n"Poor soul! He probably had no chance for an education when he was\r\nyounger," remarked Mrs. McGregor.\r\n\r\n"No, he hadn\'t. But picture it! Jove! If I had gone that long without\r\nbooks, and had been able to invent all sorts of things into the\r\nbargain, darned if I wouldn\'t have stuck it out," Carl said.\r\n\r\n"But you told us Arkwright became rich and was knighted," replied Mrs.\r\nMcGregor. "No doubt this resulted in his meeting educated people,\r\ngentlemen and ladies, in whose company he felt ashamed, uncomfortable,\r\nand at a disadvantage."\r\n\r\n"I\'d feel that way, wouldn\'t you?" nodded Mary. "I do feel so even when\r\nI am with Uncle Frederick, and my teacher, and--and you, Mother."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t include me, dear," protested her mother sadly. "Alas, I know\r\nlittle enough. But it does help you to understand how that poor,\r\nhard-working Richard Arkwright suffered. Often, I\'ll wager, he was\r\nangry at himself for his lack of education even though it was not his\r\nfault. I don\'t wonder, snubbed as he probably was at times, that he\r\ndetermined he would learn something."\r\n\r\n"His hard-earned education did not do him much good, Mother, for he\r\ndied when he was sixty," said Carl.\r\n\r\n"Well, at least he lived long enough to see his success," Mary put in\r\nbrightly.\r\n\r\n"He was luckier than Crompton," replied her brother.\r\n\r\n"Oh, tell us about Crompton. Do you remember anything about him?" Mary\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n"Crompton was one of the most important of the spinning inventors,"\r\ncontinued Carl. "But he did not set out to be an inventor any more than\r\nArkwright did. To be sure he wasn\'t a barber or anything as ordinary as\r\nthat. He was a musician, a person of quite another sort, you see. His\r\nfamily were better bred and started him out with a good education--the\r\nvery thing Arkwright lacked. Crompton might easily have mixed with the\r\nclass Arkwright wanted to mix with but he wasn\'t as good a mixer.\r\nInstead of gossiping with everybody he met, as Arkwright had done,\r\nCrompton kept by himself and lived quietly at home with his mother."\r\n\r\n"A sensible lad!" Mrs. McGregor whispered.\r\n\r\n"Maybe," grinned her son. "Still, it made people call Crompton\r\nunsociable. I guess, though, most geniuses are that. They always seem\r\nto be so in books; and Crompton certainly was a genius. He hadn\'t an\r\nounce of brain for business but he had no end of ideas; and it was\r\nthose that got him on in life. For you see, although the Cromptons were\r\nwhat Ma would call \'gentle people\', they were not rich. They were\r\ncomfortably off, though, and if the father had not died when the\r\nchildren were small they might have been very well off indeed. As it\r\nwas, Mrs. Crompton had to help out the finances by carding, spinning,\r\nand weaving cloth at home when her other work was done. Ever so many\r\nother women did it, so it was considered an all right thing to do.\r\nSince Kay\'s flying shuttle had made it possible to spin more stuff the\r\nweavers, as I told you, were scouring the country for all the warp and\r\nweft they could lay hands on, so everybody who could spin thread was\r\nsure of a market. The prices offered, and the difficulties the weavers\r\nwere having to get material enough, were common talk at every English\r\ncottage fireside. So of course it wasn\'t strange that Mrs. Crompton,\r\nalong with the rest of her neighbors, heard this gossip and also heard\r\nabout Hargreaves\'s spinning jenny. Now Samuel helped his mother to spin\r\nevenings when he wasn\'t playing at the village theater and she decided\r\nit would be nice to get one of these spinning jennies for him to use.\r\nSo she did, and it wasn\'t long before he could not only use it, but\r\ncould turn out weft enough for cloth to clothe the whole Crompton\r\nfamily."\r\n\r\n"Then I don\'t see but the Cromptons were nicely taken care of," Mary\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n"That wasn\'t the point, smartie!" her brother objected. "Of course they\r\nwere well enough off themselves, but the village of Bolton where they\r\nlived was strong on its muslins and quilt materials and what the people\r\nwanted was to be able to spin fine muslins such as were imported into\r\nEngland from India and China. If such goods could be made by uneducated\r\nOrientals why should not people as clever and ingenious as the English\r\nmake them?"\r\n\r\n"Why, indeed?"\r\n\r\n"They couldn\'t do it; I don\'t know why," answered Carl. "They just\r\ncould not contrive to draw fine enough thread. Of course Samuel\r\nCrompton had always seen the Bolton goods since he was a little boy and\r\nso knew as well as did everybody else in the town what a wonderful\r\nthing it would be if finer thread could be made. So after his mother\r\ngot her spinning jenny for him he began to fuss round with it simply to\r\nfind out whether he could make it any better or not. He experimented\r\nfive years and at the end of that time he had made a \'muslin wheel\'\r\nthat was something like Arkwright\'s water frame and something like\r\nHargreaves\'s jenny and yet wasn\'t like either of those things.\r\nTherefore, as a joke, it was called a \'mule.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m awfully glad he made it!" ejaculated the sympathetic Mary.\r\n"Five years was such a long time to work. Wasn\'t it splendid of him!"\r\n\r\n"Other people, I\'m sorry to say, were not of your opinion," Carl\r\nreplied. "As I said before, the spinners and weavers were a crazy,\r\njealous lot. You remember how they treated Kay and Hargreaves? Well,\r\nthey hadn\'t improved any and were still just as mad at spinning\r\ninventions and spinning inventors as they were before. Everything that\r\ndid away with hand labor was, they argued, an enemy and was going to\r\nput them out of business."\r\n\r\n"But how could they expect they were going to stop the progress of the\r\nworld?" asked Mrs. McGregor.\r\n\r\n"They didn\'t think it was progress; they were just that stupid,"\r\nreturned Carl. "And I guess even if they had thought so it would have\r\nbeen the same. They were determined to use nothing that reduced the\r\nnumber of hand workers. So they set themselves to take out their\r\nvengeance on all spinning machinery, and in order to put an end to it\r\nmobs of workers went about smashing to atoms every spinning jenny they\r\ncould find that had more than twenty spindles."\r\n\r\n"How nasty!" breathed Mary.\r\n\r\n"How stupid!" rejoined her mother.\r\n\r\n"Now, of course, Samuel Crompton wasn\'t going to have his new \'muslin\r\nwheel\' smashed to bits so he did not tell anybody what he had invented.\r\nHe simply took the thing to pieces and hid the parts round his\r\nworkroom. Some of them he put in the ceiling, some he tucked away under\r\nthe floor."\r\n\r\n"Bully for him!" Mary cried. "It was a regular kid trick."\r\n\r\n"I know it," agreed Carl. "He wasn\'t really a kid, though, because he\r\nwas twenty-seven years old at the time and was married and his wife had\r\njust come to live at the big Crompton homestead. Well, after a little\r\nwhile, things settled down and then Samuel Crompton dragged out the\r\nparts of his hidden muslin wheel, put them together, and he and the\r\nlady he had married went to work making the finest and strongest yarn\r\nthey could. Such fine thread had never before been made in all England\r\nand you better believe when it began to appear it created a stir.\r\nEverybody in Bolton went round trying to find out where it came from\r\nand after the tidings spread about that the Cromptons were the people\r\nwho were producing the mysterious yarn, the town swelled with pride.\r\nHow was the thread made? That was the next question!"\r\n\r\n"And the Cromptons didn\'t tell, of course."\r\n\r\n"That\'s where you\'re wrong, Mary Ann! I wish they hadn\'t; but they\r\ndid."\r\n\r\n"That was a pity," interrupted Mrs. McGregor.\r\n\r\n"You\'d have thought they would have been wise enough not to, wouldn\'t\r\nyou?" Carl observed. "But I told you Samuel Crompton had no great head\r\nfor business. He was trusting and decent, just the way Eli Whitney was.\r\nHe had no idea people would steal his invention. So when the mill\r\nowners and factory folks came surging to his house, he not only let\r\nthem see the loom but even allowed some of them to try it when they\r\nwrote out a promise or pledged their word that they would pay him for\r\nthe privilege."\r\n\r\nMrs. McGregor shook her head.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid," said she, "that was all he ever heard of the money."\r\n\r\n"Of course it was, Ma! Evidently you know more about human nature than\r\npoor Crompton did. He was utterly amazed when they wouldn\'t pay up. And\r\nwhen there were others mean enough to hide in the room over his\r\nworkshop, bore holes in the floor, and spy down at the magic machine,\r\nall was lost."\r\n\r\n"He held no patent, then?"\r\n\r\n"He hadn\'t one thing to protect him. The sharks just came down on him,\r\ngrabbed his idea, and walked away with it unmolested," answered Carl.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that was pitiful--pitiful!" exclaimed Mrs. McGregor, laying aside\r\nher work.\r\n\r\n"It was a darn shame!" echoed her son.\r\n\r\n"And the Cromptons never got any money at all?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Not then, anyhow."\r\n\r\n"Well, at least Mr. Crompton had the joy of doing what he set out to\r\ndo--nobody could take that satisfaction away from him," mused Mrs.\r\nMcGregor.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but would that have consoled you for finding that people were so\r\nlow-down?" answered Carl with scorn. "I\'ll bet that one fact\r\ndisappointed him more than the loss of the money. It would me."\r\n\r\n"Greed, I regret to say, sonny, is at the bottom of most of the evils\r\nof the world," retorted his mother sadly. "What finally became of the\r\nCromptons?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the whole thing got on Crompton\'s nerves and he moved to another\r\ntown where he buried himself," Carl answered. "After a while, though,\r\nhe came back to Bolton because he needed money and opened a little\r\nfactory there. It ran along for almost ten years, doing business on a\r\nsmall scale. Imagine it! Then in 1800 some Manchester manufacturers\r\n(who had probably got rich on his invention and whose consciences\r\ntroubled them most likely) collected a purse for him that his mill\r\nmight be enlarged. By this time as a result of various improvements\r\nCrompton\'s idea had expanded until one of his looms had as many as\r\nthree hundred and sixty spindles, and another had two hundred and\r\ntwenty."\r\n\r\n"And years before the spinners had destroyed those that boasted more\r\nthan twenty," commented Mary thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"I know it! Ironic, wasn\'t it? Poor old Crompton! He just didn\'t seem\r\nto have any luck," asserted Carl.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t want of luck, my dear, so much as want of wisdom--the wit to\r\ngrasp opportunity when it came," contradicted his mother.\r\n\r\n"You mean \'there is a tide in the affairs of men\', Ma, and all that?"\r\nCarl grinned. "Who says I don\'t know Shakespeare when I meet him?\r\nAnyhow, I guess Bill was right; he certainly was in this case. Even the\r\nmoney the English government later collected and presented to Crompton\r\ngot dribbled away and lost in various unfortunate enterprises. Crompton\r\ngot poorer and poorer, and if it hadn\'t been that friends took care of\r\nhim he might almost have starved."\r\n\r\n"And did his star never rise again?" inquired Mrs. McGregor.\r\n\r\n"Never! He just died in poverty and left other people to grow rich on\r\nwhat he had done."\r\n\r\n"That is the world, I am afraid," was Mrs. McGregor\'s observation.\r\n"Still he had given humanity a hand up and done a great service to his\r\ngeneration. That knowledge was better than all the fortunes he could\r\nhave possessed."\r\n\r\n"But he might so easily have had both, Ma," returned the practical\r\nCarl. "I call the help to humanity slim comfort when you\'ve been\r\ncheated out of what should have been yours. I shouldn\'t even have been\r\ngrateful had I been Crompton for the fine monument they set up to his\r\nmemory long after he was dead. What they ought to have done was to\r\ntreat him square while he was alive to enjoy it."\r\n\r\n"See that as you go through life you do not forget your own philosophy,\r\nmy son," cautioned his mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTIDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following week brought a letter from Uncle Frederick and very\r\nimportant the McGregors felt when they took it, adorned with its\r\nEnglish stamp, from the mail box in the hall. Mulberry Court did not\r\nreceive so many letters that the arrival of one was a routine affair.\r\nNo, indeed! When a real letter came to any of its residents the fact\r\nwas remarked upon by the recipient with a casualness calculated to veil\r\nthe pride he or she experienced.\r\n\r\nMrs. O\'Dowd, for example, in passing through the hall would call\r\ncarelessly to one of her neighbors:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just had a letter from my sister Jane in Fall River. Plague the\r\ngirl! What can she be writing to me about?"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of this ungracious observation Mrs. O\'Dowd was\r\nmuch pleased to be seen with the letter and overhear her friends\r\nwhispering among themselves:\r\n\r\n"Julie O\'Dowd had a letter from Jane to-day. It was in a blue envelope\r\nand looked like quite a thick one. What do you suppose the girl had to\r\nsay? Most likely Julie will tell us by and by."\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough! The prediction was a true prophecy, for before the day\r\nwas out Julie had made an errand to every flat in the house and before\r\nleaving had read to each family extracts from the letter, interspersing\r\nthe paragraphs with a running line of comment concerning Jane and her\r\nhistory since babyhood. By evening the letter had become blurred and\r\ndingy with much handling and Julie could recite it from beginning to\r\nend.\r\n\r\nYet for all the interest evoked by Julie\'s letters and the other rare\r\nepistles that found their way into Mulberry Court these missives came\r\nafter all only from American cities which lay within a radius of a\r\nhundred miles of Baileyville. They had not traveled far, any more than\r\nhad the persons to whom they were addressed. They were not letters\r\nwritten on thin foreign paper and bearing unfamiliar postmarks and the\r\nfascinating stamps of other nations. Only the McGregors could boast\r\nsuch splendor as that.\r\n\r\nRealizing this, Mrs. McGregor would have been short of human if she had\r\nnot been a wee bit self-conscious and forced to suppress from her voice\r\nthe satisfaction that echoed in it when she observed in off-hand\r\nfashion:\r\n\r\n"Oh, by the way, I had a letter to-day from my brother who is in\r\nChina."\r\n\r\nChina! It was a name to conjure with. What a medley of visions it\r\nbrought to the imagination!\r\n\r\nAnd if you could not go to China, as none of Mulberry Court ever\r\nexpected to do, think of having a relative who did! And if you were not\r\nblessed with such an illustrious connection why the next best thing was\r\nto know some one who was. Even to know some one who had a brother in\r\nChina and who sent home letters from that magic realm imparted a\r\ncertain glory.\r\n\r\nThere was no denying the McGregors\' foreign correspondence lent\r\nprestige to Mulberry Court. Perhaps a Manila postmark was cut out and\r\nbestowed on Mrs. Murphy, who tucked it away in a cracked cup and\r\ndisplayed it on occasions to a visitor; or maybe the letter heading\r\nfrom a Genoa hotel was given to Mrs. O\'Dowd and furnished her with\r\nconversation for a week. In outbursts of great generosity stamps or\r\npostcards were donated to especially favored individuals.\r\n\r\nHence when on this particular morning the postman pressed Mrs.\r\nMcGregor\'s bell and she hastened down four flights to open her mail-box\r\na head protruded from almost every door as she made her way back\r\nupstairs and there was ample opportunity for her to observe to\r\ninterested spectators, "I seem to have a letter from England. Judging\r\nfrom the postmark, my brother must be in Liverpool."\r\n\r\nIn this case the admiration with which the name was repeated might not\r\nhave found so ringing an echo in Mrs. McGregor\'s voice. She had been to\r\nLiverpool. For all that, however, she maintained a dignified front and\r\nbore the letter upstairs, sinking with delight into the first chair\r\nthat blocked her path when she arrived and calling to her children:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a letter from your Uncle Frederick, Timmie. Think of that! It\r\ncomes all the way from Liverpool with King George neat as a pin smiling\r\nout of the corner of it. Yes, you may take the envelope, Carl, but\r\ndon\'t let the baby be fingering and tearing it. Show Martin the King\'s\r\npicture. He\'s old enough now to learn how he looks. Mercy on us! What a\r\nream your Uncle Frederick has written. One would think it was a book! I\r\nnever knew him to write such a long letter in all my life. I hope he\r\nisn\'t sick. Don\'t hang over my shoulder, Mary; it makes me nervous. And\r\ndon\'t let Nell come climbing up into my lap while I\'m reading. Go to\r\nMary, like a good girl, darling; mother\'s reading a letter that came\r\nall the way from England."\r\n\r\nThus did Mrs. McGregor preface the perusal of the document she held in\r\nher hand. But when she had spread out the voluminous sheets and was\r\npreparing to read them she was again interrupted:\r\n\r\n"Now, Timmie, don\'t you and Carl start quarreling the first thing about\r\nthe stamp. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Who had the last one?\r\nCarl? Then this one goes to you and there must be no more bickering\r\nabout it. If there is I shall keep it myself. One would think you boys\r\nwere a pair of Kilkenny cats the way you squabble with each other! Now\r\nare you going to be quiet and listen to what Uncle Frederick has to say\r\nor are you not? Then don\'t let me hear another yip out of either of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nInstantly the room was so still you could have heard a pin drop and to\r\nan accompaniment of crisply crackling paper Mrs. McGregor began:\r\n\r\n    LIVERPOOL, January 29, 1924.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SISTER NELLIE--,\r\n\r\n    Well, here I am in England with the Atlantic rolling between me and\r\n    Baileyville. We had a splendid voyage with the sea as smooth as the\r\n    top of your sewing-machine. (Ain\'t that like your Uncle Frederick\r\n    to joke about the ocean! He\'s crossed it that number of times it\'s\r\n    no more to him than the pond in the park. Well, I\'m glad he had a\r\n    smooth trip, anyway.)\r\n\r\n    At Liverpool, where we docked, we ran into our first trouble, for\r\n    there was a longshoremen\'s strike on and not a soul could he found\r\n    to unload our cargo or lend a hand in loading us up again. For\r\n    three days we were tied plumb to the wharf with nothing to do but\r\n    twirl our thumbs. So having business at Manchester I decided to go\r\n    up there and stay with a Scotchman who was my first mate years ago.\r\n    (Now wasn\'t that nice!) Old Barney turned the town inside out he\r\n    was so glad to see me (I\'ll wager he was!) and among other things\r\n    took me through some big cotton mills where a nephew of his was\r\n    working. For the benefit of the children I\'m going to write a bit\r\n    about them. I could not but wish on top of what we all talked about\r\n    that they might have been with me to see how wonderful the spinning\r\n    machinery is. Were it actually alive it could not work with more\r\n    brains. (Your Uncle Frederick always will have his joke!)\r\n\r\n    Indeed, the man who took us about told me that the self-acting mule\r\n    of to-day, founded on the invention of Crompton, is a product of\r\n    hundreds of minds and I can well believe it. It isn\'t the principle\r\n    that is new, for apparently no one has ever improved on Crompton\'s\r\n    idea; but since that time this machinist and that has added his bit\r\n    to make the device more perfect. (Now ain\'t you glad you read about\r\n    Crompton, Carl? This letter would have been Greek to you if you\r\n    hadn\'t.) We saw mules as long as a hundred and twenty feet, and\r\n    from nine to ten feet wide carrying some twelve or thirteen hundred\r\n    spindles, and turning out about two yards of thread in a quarter of\r\n    a minute. How is that? And all this clicking, humming, whirling\r\n    machinery was operated by a man and a couple of boys. Carl, Tim and\r\n    I could have run the thing had we known how.\r\n\r\n    (Your Uncle Frederick don\'t forget you boys, you see!)\r\n\r\n    They told me it was Richard Roberts, a Manchester man, who in 1830\r\n    improved the self-acting mule and brought it to its present state\r\n    of practical working order. I take off my hat to him and to those\r\n    on whose ideas he built up this marvelous invention. The thing does\r\n    everything but talk, and maybe it\'s as well off without doing that.\r\n    Lots of folks would be.\r\n\r\n    (I must read Julie O\'Dowd that; it will make her laugh. It sounds\r\n    so like your uncle you\'d think him in the room this minute.)\r\n\r\n    It draws out the carded cotton, puts in the necessary twist, and\r\n    spins the thread, easy as rolling off a log, levers, wheels,\r\n    springs, and a friction clutch all doing their part. I couldn\'t\r\n    help thinking if each of us humans played his r\xc3\xb4le as well, and did\r\n    the thing given him to do as faithfully, how much better a world we\r\n    should have. We don\'t begin to pull together for a result the way\r\n    those wheels and pulleys did. Instead, each of us goes his own way\r\n    never co\xc3\xb6perating with his neighbor and in consequence we have a\r\n    helter-skelter universe. (How true that is!)\r\n\r\n    Nevertheless in spite of us--not because of us--the world advances.\r\n    I sometimes wonder how it does it. Crompton, for instance, would\r\n    scarcely have recognized his old mule that gave subsequent\r\n    inventors their inspiration. Nor would Arkwright know his water\r\n    frame could he see what has happened to it. (Mark you, Carl, how he\r\n    speaks of Arkwright. All that would slide off you hadn\'t you read\r\n    that book!)\r\n\r\n    Of course there is a lot of rivalry between English and American\r\n    spinning machinery and I found that some of the mills here have\r\n    both.\r\n\r\n    The reeling of the yarn after it is spun is done chiefly by women.\r\n    I do not mean they make it up into skeins by hand; they operate the\r\n    machinery that winds it; also that which makes it up into packages\r\n    for the market. This process is also interesting to see. Strings\r\n    are put in to separate the laps of the yarn; cardboards hold it in\r\n    place; it is pressed flat; the bundle is tied; and the paper\r\n    wrapper bearing the name of the manufacturer as well as any printed\r\n    advertising he wishes to circulate, is whisked about it.\r\n\r\n    I was a little surprised to find they made no spool cotton on any\r\n    of these machines. Up to date no machine has been invented that\r\n    will directly spin thread strong enough for sewing. All that has to\r\n    be a separate process and therefore the yarn is taken to other\r\n    machines where it is drawn finer and where several of the fine\r\n    threads can be twisted into one. The spinners know just how many\r\n    fine threads to put together to get certain sizes of cotton. To\r\n    make number twelve, for example, they put together four strands of\r\n    what is called 48\'s that have been doubled, or perhaps 50\'s, since\r\n    the twist contracts the yarn.\r\n\r\n    After this has been twisted the proper number of times the thread\r\n    is passed over flannel-covered boards to be cleaned. Next it\r\n    travels through a small, round hole something like the eye of a\r\n    needle so that any knots or rough places can be detected. If the\r\n    threads are found to be strong and without flaws two to half a\r\n    dozen of them are put together in a loose skein and they are\r\n    twisted in a doubling machine. Afterward the thread is polished,\r\n    cleaned, and run off on spools or bobbins. That is the road\r\n    Mother\'s spools of cotton have to travel before they get to her.\r\n    How seldom we think of this or are grateful for it!\r\n\r\n    There are in addition other ways of preparing cottons for\r\n    embroidery, crocheting, or knitting, not to mention methods used to\r\n    finish cotton yarn so that it will look like woolen, linen, or silk\r\n    fiber. Because cotton is a cheaper material than any of these it is\r\n    often mixed with them to produce cheaper goods. You would be amazed\r\n    to see how ingenious manufacturers have become in turning out such\r\n    imitations. Cotton, for example, is mercerized by passing it very\r\n    rapidly through a gassing machine not unlike the flame of a Bunsen\r\n    burner. Here all the fuzz protruding from it is burned away, and\r\n    when polished and finished it looks so much like silk you would\r\n    have trouble in telling whether it was or not. This sort of yarn is\r\n    used to make imitation silk stockings and many other articles.\r\n\r\n    Now I have told you quite a story, haven\'t I? And no doubt I have\r\n    wasted good ink and paper doing it, for I presume Hal Harling could\r\n    have told you the same thing quite as well if not a deal better.\r\n    You read him this document and ask him to fill in the gaps. But at\r\n    least even if Hal can improve on my tale I have demonstrated one\r\n    thing and that is that I have remembered you whenever I have seen\r\n    anything I thought you would be interested in.\r\n\r\n    I send much love to each of the family. Tell Mary, Carl, and Tim to\r\n    take good care of Mother and the babies. Be sure to greet for me\r\n    the Harlings, O\'Dowds, Murphys, and all the neighbors at Mulberry\r\n    Court. We leave Liverpool for the Mediterranean next week and I\r\n    will write you from Gibraltar or Naples. In the meantime do not\r\n    forget the good ship _Charlotte_ or your affectionate\r\n\r\n    FREDERICK.\r\n\r\n"As if we could forget him!" whispered Mrs. McGregor, folding up the\r\nmany sheets and replacing them in their envelope. "It isn\'t all\r\nchildren have the kind uncle you have. Carl, maybe you\'d like to be\r\nstepping over to the Harlings with this letter. Grandfather Harling\r\nwould delight to read it, I know. The days are long ones for him and\r\nI\'m sure he must miss your Uncle Frederick dropping in to bring him the\r\nnews."\r\n\r\nOnly too ready to comply with her request Carl rose.\r\n\r\n"You can leave the letter until they all have seen it; then Hal or\r\nLouise can bring it back. I want Mrs. O\'Dowd to have it next. She\'s\r\nmentioned by name in it and it will please her to read the words\r\nherself."\r\n\r\nThus did Mulberry Court share its blessings!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nA RELUCTANT ALTRUIST\r\n\r\n\r\nAs spring came and Carl was more out of doors playing ball and tramping\r\nthe open country his watchful eyes were continually scanning passing\r\nmotors for a possible glimpse of the mysterious red racing car and its\r\ngenial owner. The boy had never forgotten this delightful stranger or\r\nquite abandoned the hope that he might sometime see him again. But,\r\nalas, day succeeded day and never did any of the fleeting vehicles his\r\nglance followed contain the person he sought. Neither was the search\r\nfor the sender of the Christmas baskets rewarded.\r\n\r\nSpasmodically since mid-winter the Harlings and McGregors had cudgeled\r\ntheir brains to discover this elusive good fairy until at length,\r\nexhausted by fruitless effort, they agreed to inter Louise\'s\r\nphilanthropic Mr. X in a nameless grave. Despite that fact, however, he\r\nwas not forgotten and tender thoughts clustered about his memory.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime May followed on April\'s heels and presently June, with\r\nher greenery and wealth of roses arrived, and then the startling\r\ntidings buzzed through Baileyville that Mr. John Coulter was to be\r\nmarried. The news thrilled young and old alike for was not young Mr.\r\nCoulter the junior partner of Davis and Coulter; and was not Davis and\r\nCoulter the heart and soul of Baileyville? Davis and Coulter meant the\r\nmills and the mills meant the town itself. Without them there would\r\nhave been no village at all. Boys and girls, men and women toiled year\r\nin and year out in the factories as their fathers and mothers, often\r\ntheir grandfathers and grandmothers had done before them. If you were\r\nnot connected with Davis and Coulter\'s you were not of Baileyville\'s\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nHence it followed that the prospective marriage of Mr. John Coulter\r\ncould not but be an event concerning which the entire community\r\ngossiped with eager and kindly interest. The lady was from New York,\r\npeople said, and Mr. John had met her while doing war work in France.\r\nBoth of them had large fortunes. But the fact that appealed to the\r\nvillagers far more than this was the intelligence that the wedding was\r\nto take place at the old Coulter homestead and be followed by a f\xc3\xaate to\r\nwhich all the mill people and their families were to be invited. How\r\nexciting that was! And how exultant were those whose connection with\r\nthe mills insured them a card to this mammoth festivity!\r\n\r\nRumor whispered there were to be gigantic tents with games and dancing;\r\nbands of music; fireworks; and every imaginable dainty to eat. Some\r\neven went so far as to assert there would be boats on the miniature\r\nlake and a Punch and Judy show. Oh, it was to be a f\xc3\xaate indeed!\r\n\r\nFor weeks the town talked of nothing else; and as Carl McGregor\r\nlistened to these stories his regrets at not being numbered among Davis\r\nand Coulter\'s elect waxed keener and keener. One did not enjoy being\r\nleft out of a function of such magnitude, a party to which everybody\r\nelse was going. Not only did it make you feel lonely and stranded but\r\nit mortified you to be obliged to own you were not of the happy band\r\nincluded in so magnificent a celebration.\r\n\r\n"Now if you\'d only have let me take a job at the mills as I wanted to,\r\nMa, we might have been going to Mr. Coulter\'s party along with the rest\r\nof the world," Carl bemoaned. "I always told you I ought to go into\r\nthose mills the way the other fellows do. But you wouldn\'t hear to it.\r\nNow see what\'s come of it. We are left high and dry. I\'ll bet we are\r\nthe only people in Baileyville who are not invited to that party.\r\nEverybody is to be there. If even one member of a family works at the\r\nmill that lets in the bunch."\r\n\r\n"Like the garden parties great families used to give their tenants in\r\nthe old country," Mrs. McGregor murmured reminiscently.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about the old country," replied Carl ungraciously, "but\r\nthat is what Mr. Coulter is going to do--ask whole families. Gee, but\r\nit makes me sore!"\r\n\r\n"If your father had lived we would have been there," said the boy\'s\r\nmother sadly. "Your father used to be very good friends with old Mr.\r\nCoulter and he would have seen to it that none of this household was\r\nleft out. But Mr. John we never knew. He was always away\r\nstudying--first at school, then at college, and then in Europe. Later\r\nhe started in to be a lawyer in New York and but for the war and his\r\nfather\'s death he\'d most likely be doing that now. But when the old\r\ngentleman died Mr. John gave up everything else and came home to take\r\nhis place in the firm as his father had wished he should. Folks say\r\nthat in spite of not caring much for the mills at first he has\r\npersisted at his job until he has become genuinely interested in them.\r\nI honor him for it, too, for a business life wasn\'t his real choice. Of\r\ncourse being away so much as he has he is little known among the mill\r\npeople yet; but evidently he means to settle down here and is anxious\r\nto get better acquainted. This wedding party shows that."\r\n\r\n"Well, there are some he won\'t get acquainted with," lamented Carl.\r\n\r\n"If you mean us I reckon he can worry along without," Mrs. McGregor\r\nretorted, with a twinkle in her eye. "He\'s managed to up to now."\r\n\r\n"We\'re just as good as anybody else," her son blazed.\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly we are," was the good-humored answer. "Nevertheless we\r\nwon\'t be missed in a crowd like that."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you _want_ to go to the party, Ma?"\r\n\r\n"Why, to tell the truth, I haven\'t had time to think much about it,\r\nsonny--that is, not to be disappointed. I\'m not pretending, though,\r\nthat so many parties come my way that a fine one such as this wouldn\'t\r\nbe a treat. I can\'t remember the day I\'ve been to anything of the\r\nsort. It\'s a quarter of a century or more, certainly--not since I was\r\na girl and went to the balls the gentry gave in Scotland."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do so wish we were going to Mr. Coulter\'s," Carl repeated.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not deny I\'d like to," confessed his mother a bit wistfully.\r\n"Still, were we to go what a stew we\'d be in! It would mean days of\r\nwashing and ironing; new neckties and maybe shoes for you boys; and\r\nhair ribbons and folderols for Mary and Nell. Before we were all\r\nproperly equipped it would cost a pretty penny. We\'d have no right to\r\ngo without looking decent and being a credit to your father and to Mr.\r\nCoulter who was good enough to ask us. So, you see, there are\r\nadvantages in everything. If we are not invited we shall have none of\r\nthe trouble and expense of it," concluded the woman philosophically.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t mind the trouble, Mother," burst out Carl. "I wouldn\'t\r\neven care if I didn\'t have new shoes. Why, I\'d go in my bathing suit."\r\n\r\nNodding her head his mother regarded him with withering censure.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe you would," she agreed, "I believe you would--if you\r\nwere permitted. But how lucky it is you have a mother. Without me\r\nyou\'d be disgracing your name, Mr. Coulter, Baileyville, and Mulberry\r\nCourt."\r\n\r\nCarl grinned in sickly fashion.\r\n\r\n"I\'d be having the time of my life!" announced he, undaunted.\r\n\r\n"Going to an affair like that in your bathing suit, you mean? I\'m not\r\nso sure about that. You are always begging to be allowed to wear that\r\ncostume or grumbling because you cannot wear it. Once, I recall, you\r\nactually suggested wearing it to church on a hot Sunday. I\'m sorely\r\ntempted sometime to let you have your way and see what would come of\r\nit. Think, for instance, of your sailing into Mr. John Coulter\'s\r\nwedding party in a get-up like that. You\'d be ducked in the pond in a\r\nsecond."\r\n\r\n"I\'d be ready for it," was the provoking answer.\r\n\r\n"Well, you aren\'t going to the Coulter party, as it happens, so\r\nthere\'ll be no question of what you\'ll wear," returned Mrs. McGregor\r\ngrimly.\r\n\r\n"I know I\'m not; but you don\'t have to rub it in, Ma," Carl answered.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to rub it in, dear," was the gentle response. "I was\r\nmerely stating facts. Maybe it\'s as well, too, that we\'re not going\r\nourselves, for with the Sullivans, Murphys, and O\'Dowds all invited\r\nwe\'ll have as much as we can do to get them all creditably rigged out.\r\nI shall let Julie wear my black skirt--it just fits her; and Mrs.\r\nSullivan my best hat. My waist Mrs. Murphy shall take if I can get it\r\nwashed in time. Most likely, too, the O\'Dowds will need your clothes\r\nand Timmie\'s."\r\n\r\n"Need my clothes!" Carl shouted.\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Julie can\'t hope to provide things for all that big family\r\nto appear in at once. Somebody will have to turn to and lend a helping\r\nhand."\r\n\r\n"But what\'ll I do while the O\'Dowd boys wear my clothes?" wailed Carl.\r\n\r\n"Why, you can stay in the house. It won\'t hurt either you or Tim to\r\ntake an afternoon of rest," came stoically from his mother.\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want to take an afternoon of rest," Carl protested\r\nwrathfully. "Not on that day of all others. I\'m going up to Coulters\r\nto hang round outside and watch the fun. If I\'m not invited I can at\r\nleast do that."\r\n\r\n"Carl McGregor! You\'ll do nothing of the sort. Hang round outside,\r\nindeed! Haven\'t you any pride at all? If you\'re not asked to the\r\nparty I should hope you\'d have the good taste to keep out of the way of\r\nit. Hang round outside! You ought to be ashamed even to suggest such a\r\nthing," said Mrs. McGregor with scorn. "No, you\'ll do no lingering on\r\nthe outskirts of Mr. John\'s reception, you can make up your mind to\r\nthat. You\'ll stay politely at home as the rest of us plan to do and\r\nkeep under cover so folks won\'t be asking you why you\'re not up at\r\nCoulters. I\'ve some regard for the family dignity if you haven\'t. And\r\nsince you\'ll be at home anyway, you may as well take the chance to do a\r\nkindly deed and let Frankie O\'Dowd wear your clothes. You don\'t want to\r\ngrow up to be selfish."\r\n\r\n"My pants will be miles too long for that O\'Dowd kid," responded the\r\nunwilling altruist grudgingly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, his mother can baste them up so they\'ll do for one afternoon," was\r\nthe serene answer.\r\n\r\n"Huh! I don\'t envy Frank going to that party with two thicknesses of\r\ntrousers on his legs," Carl declared. "If it\'s a hot day he\'ll melt."\r\n\r\n"Beggars cannot be choosers," Mrs. McGregor asserted. "Likely Frankie\r\nwill be that tickled to go to the lawn party that he won\'t care what he\r\nhas on any more than you would. You\'d go quicker than a wink in\r\nbasted-up trousers if you got the chance."\r\n\r\n"You bet I would! Why, I\'d go in--in--in _anything_!" was the fervent\r\naffirmation. "Somehow, Ma, it just seems as if I couldn\'t give up the\r\nidea of going. I feel as if something _must_ happen so we\'d get asked."\r\n\r\n"Why, Carl--you silly boy! You don\'t mean to say you are actually\r\ncherishing the thought you may be invited yet?" his mother exclaimed\r\nincredulously. "Put it out of your head, son, like a sensible lad.\r\nThere isn\'t a chance of it, dear. The invitations were sent out last\r\nweek and had you been going to get one you would have received it days\r\nago. There\'ll be no more people asked now."\r\n\r\n"There might be--some might have been forgotten by mistake. Or the\r\ninvitation might have got stuck in the letter box and delayed."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not, Carlie!" his mother said gently. "Mark my words, all\r\nthe invitations there are going to be to that garden party have gone\r\nout. There won\'t be any more. The folks that haven\'t had theirs already\r\nwon\'t have none and if you\'re wise you will face that fact and give up\r\nthinking about Mr. Coulter and his wedding."\r\n\r\nThe corners of Carl\'s mouth drooped but he stubbornly insisted:\r\n\r\n"Well, anyhow, Ma, don\'t you tell Frankie O\'Dowd he can have my clothes\r\nuntil the very last minute, will you? Promise me that."\r\n\r\n"Aye! I\'ll not mention the clothes yet awhile. I\'ll wait at least a day\r\nor two. Most likely Julie or the Murphys will be up by that time and\r\nask for \'em."\r\n\r\nAnd with this scanty comfort Carl was obliged to be content.\r\n\r\nEven the concession that he would be allowed to wear his bathing suit\r\nwhile at home was but feeble consolation. What did it matter what he\r\nwore if he couldn\'t go to the Coulter f\xc3\xaate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nAN ORDEAL\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the date for the Coulters\' f\xc3\xaate approached the weather was\r\nbreathlessly scanned in practically every home in Baileyville and\r\nthrobbing hearts almost ceased to beat lest the day be stormy or too\r\ncold to wear the finery that awaited the great occasion. Could one have\r\ntaken off the roofs of the houses between his thumb and forefinger as\r\nhe would lift the cover off a sugar-bowl, what a bewildering array of\r\nfreshly starched muslins, clean shirts and collars, shining shoes, and\r\nrose-encircled hats would have met his gaze!\r\n\r\nCarl McGregor had spoken truly when he had affirmed to his mother that\r\neverybody in the town was going to the wedding festival. All\r\nBaileyville was on tiptoe with excitement. The schools were to be\r\nclosed for the afternoon, not alone to do Mr. Coulter honor, but\r\nbecause it was quite evident that no children would be found in their\r\nseats on the great day.\r\n\r\n"We McGregors would be the only kids in the whole place, I bet, if they\r\ndid have school," declared Carl gloomily. "You see, Ma, it\'s just as I\r\ntold you--everybody\'s going to the Coulters\'."\r\n\r\n"I should think, hating school as you do, you\'d be thankful to have a\r\nholiday," commented Mary.\r\n\r\n"Ordinarily I would," was the prompt reply. "But what good is this\r\nholiday going to do me, I\'d like to know, with Frankie O\'Dowd wearing\r\nall my clothes, and Mother forbidding me to go out of the house in my\r\nbathing suit?"\r\n\r\n"Well, at least you won\'t have to study," said his optimistic sister,\r\nmaking an effort to comfort her morose companion.\r\n\r\n"I might as well study; it would take up my mind," fretted Carl. "I\'ve\r\nnothing better to do."\r\n\r\nHis ill humor was so tragic that in spite of herself Mary laughed.\r\n\r\n"Well, you needn\'t grin so over it, Miss Superiority, or go pretending\r\nyou don\'t wish you could go to the lawn party."\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'d love to go," Mary confessed honestly. "But if we can\'t I\r\ndon\'t see any use in mourning about it and talking of nothing else."\r\n\r\n"I _have_ to talk about it. I think of it every minute."\r\n\r\n"Put it out of your head."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! You don\'t try. Why don\'t you set about doing something and\r\nforget it instead of sitting round mooning and working yourself all up?\r\nYou can run down and get the mail right now. There\'s the bell. Maybe\r\nit\'s a letter from Uncle Frederick."\r\n\r\nWelcoming the diversion her brother rose with alacrity. He was in a\r\nmood when any excitement, no matter how trivial, was a boon. Down the\r\nstairs he ran only to return a second later with a square white\r\nenvelope in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Is it from Uncle Frederick?" queried Mary eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Nope!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m sorry, we haven\'t heard from him for ever so long. I do hope\r\nnothing\'s the matter. Who is the letter from?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\nSomething in the reticence of the reply caused the girl to glance up.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take it in to Mother," volunteered she, holding out her hand.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t for Mother," Carl answered slowly.\r\n\r\n"Not for Mother? How funny! None of the rest of us ever have letters.\r\nWho is it for?"\r\n\r\n"It happens to be mine."\r\n\r\n"Carl!" Dismay and apprehension vibrated in the word.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s mine," her brother repeated. His obvious attempt to carry\r\noff the episode in jaunty fashion failed, however, and it was evident\r\nby his tense tones that he echoed Mary\'s alarm.\r\n\r\n"But who on earth can be writing to you?" demanded his sister.\r\n\r\n"I--I--don\'t know." The boy fingered the envelope with uneasiness. Mary\r\ncame nearer.\r\n\r\n"Carl, what have you been up to now?" asked she. "That looks like the\r\nteacher\'s writing. Aren\'t you going to be promoted or what is the\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\n"How do I know until I read the thing?" snapped Carl.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not in any scrape?"\r\n\r\n"Not that I know of."\r\n\r\n"Honestly?"\r\n\r\n"I tell you I can\'t think of any. On my honor I can\'t."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well then, it\'s probably about your work. Most likely you\'re\r\nbehind the class in something and Miss Dewey wants to see you. Why\r\ndon\'t you buck up and find out what she has to say?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to in a minute."\r\n\r\n"You\'re afraid to open that letter. You\'ve done something at school you\r\ndon\'t want Mother and me to know about."\r\n\r\n"I tell you I haven\'t."\r\n\r\n"Then why, for pity\'s sake, don\'t you read what Miss Dewey has written\r\ninstead of looking at the note as if it was a bomb? Maybe she\'s\r\ninviting you to supper. She does ask the boys sometimes."\r\n\r\nThis possibility was so encouraging that the startled expression in the\r\nlad\'s eyes gave place to a serener light. Perhaps after all the\r\nmissive did not portend the calamity that a note from school usually\r\ndid. Maybe his algebra was all right and he had not flunked his Latin.\r\nThe fates may have graciously intervened.\r\n\r\nCourageously he tore open the envelope; then a sharp cry came from his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" he cried. "Mother! Mother! Where are you?"\r\n\r\n"Here, dear, in my room. Is anything the matter?"\r\n\r\nCarl rushed off unceremoniously, leaving the mystified Mary alone in\r\nthe middle of the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ma," he panted, "what do you suppose? We\'re going, after\r\nall--every one of us! Think of it! We\'re going!"\r\n\r\n"Going where? Have you taken leave of your senses, sonny? What are you\r\ntalking about, pray?"\r\n\r\n"We\'re going to the Coulters\', Ma," asserted Carl, waving the white\r\nenvelope above his head in a frenzy of delight. "Look! Here\'s the bid.\r\nAnd across the bottom of the paper Mr. Coulter himself has written to\r\nsay that he\'s sorry the invitation has been so delayed and he hopes my\r\nmother and all of us--even the baby--will come. Gee!"\r\n\r\nQuite exhausted, Carl dropped into a chair.\r\n\r\n"But why should Mr. Coulter send this invitation to you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, I\'m sure. Maybe Hal Harling or somebody told him how\r\ndisappointed I was at not being asked," returned Carl serenely.\r\n\r\n"Mercy! I hope not," ejaculated his horrified mother.\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Why, it would be almost like asking Mr. Coulter for an invitation."\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t care, I guess," came comfortably from Carl. "There\'s\r\nplenty of room and there\'ll be food enough so a few people more or less\r\nwouldn\'t bother him."\r\n\r\n"But I wouldn\'t think of going to a party, or letting you, if you had\r\ndemanded in so many words to be invited," returned Mrs. McGregor with a\r\ntoss of her head.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say, Ma, that you\'re thinking of not going," her son\r\ngasped.\r\n\r\n"I certainly shall not stir a step to Mr. Coulter\'s until I find out\r\nhow we happened to receive this remarkable invitation."\r\n\r\n"Ma!"\r\n\r\n"I sha\'n\'t," repeated his mother. "Why, the bare idea of your trying to\r\nget a card to that wedding reception!"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t try to, Mother; honest, I didn\'t," protested Carl. "I didn\'t\r\nask anybody to do a thing for me. I was only fooling when I said that.\r\nOf course Hal Harling knows well enough that I\'ve been crazy to go. He\r\nand Louise couldn\'t help seeing how sore I was about it. But I never\r\nsaid anything else."\r\n\r\n"I\'m thankful to hear that. One never knows what you will do."\r\n\r\nMrs. McGregor gave a sigh of relief and taking the card examined it.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," she presently observed in a gentler tone, "this invitation\r\nhas nothing to do with you. It may be possible that young Mr. Coulter\r\nremembered how long your father worked in the mills and thought it\r\nwould be nice to ask us because of that. If so, it was very thoughtful\r\nof him. And most likely the card was sent to you because he happened to\r\nhave heard your name. Goodness knows, with the messes you\'re in, I\r\nshould think all the town might be aware of it."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll go, Ma?" In his eagerness Carl brushed aside the\r\nunflattering picture his mother\'s words presented.\r\n\r\n"If I find it\'s a bona fide invitation and not some of your concocting\r\nI\'ll go--not otherwise. It would be ungrateful to snub Mr. John if he\r\nis trying to be kind. But the thing that makes me doubtful is that the\r\nenvelope should be addressed to you. Why wasn\'t the invitation sent to\r\nme? I am the head of the family--or at least I attempt to be," amended\r\nshe with an upward curve of her lips.\r\n\r\n"Oh, who cares, Ma, who the invitation was addressed to?" cut in Carl\r\nimpatiently. "The main thing is that it\'s come and we are going to the\r\nparty. I\'d go had it been sent to James Frederick. What does it matter?\r\nSay, Ma, isn\'t it lucky you hadn\'t loaned our clothes? We\'ll need \'em\r\nourselves now."\r\n\r\n"When is the wedding?" Mary asked.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say you don\'t even know?" inquired her brother with\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve forgotten."\r\n\r\n"You have! Then you are the only person in Baileyville who has," was\r\nthe sarcastic rejoinder. "Well, if you must know, it\'s the day after\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\n"It will be a scramble to get ready, won\'t it, Mother?" commented the\r\npractical Mary.\r\n\r\n"There certainly will be a lot to do," Mrs. McGregor agreed. "However,\r\nI guess we can manage if everybody will turn to."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll help," announced Carl in a burst of magnanimousness. "I\'ll wash\r\nand iron all my own clothes."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like a peep at the shirt you washed and ironed," taunted Mary in\r\nderision.\r\n\r\n"I fancy a peep would be enough," put in her mother, laughing. "No,\r\nson, your talent does not lie in washing or ironing. But you can take\r\ncare of the youngsters while Mary and I do it. And, Mary, we\'ll have to\r\nget a bunch of fresh flowers for your best hat; those pink daisies are\r\ntoo faded to wear. We\'ll get a new hair ribbon, too. And I must have\r\nsome other lace in the neck of my silk waist and----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, if you\'re going to talk ribbon, artificial flowers, and all that\r\nrot I\'m going over to Harlings," announced Carl, rising.\r\n\r\n"Indeed you\'re not," objected his mother. "You\'re going to get out the\r\nblacking bottle and start cleaning and polishing the shoes. There\'ll be\r\nseven pairs to get ready and I want a fine shine on every one of them."\r\n\r\n"But what\'s the use of doing it now? They\'ll get all dusty again before\r\nthe day after to-morrow," Carl grumbled.\r\n\r\n"Not if they\'re put away," came in even accents from his mother. "We\'ll\r\njust have to wear slippers, sneakers and things until Tuesday. I guess\r\nwe can get along. We can\'t go leaving everything until the last minute\r\nor we shall be all up in a heap. We must begin directly to get things\r\ndone. I shall braid your hair, Mary, and Nell\'s right away, so it will\r\nbe well crimped. And Timmie, you and Carl and Martin have all got to\r\nhave baths. Yes, you have, whether you like it or not. If you don\'t you\r\ncan\'t go. That\'s all there is about that, so stop fussing. Carl, you\r\nput some kettles of water on the stove to heat. You boys must be\r\nscrubbed whether the rest of us are or not. You need it most. And Mary,\r\nrun like a good girl and see if you can hunt up a clean pair of\r\nstockings for everybody--stockings without too many holes. Mercy on us!\r\nI wish Mr. Coulter had given us a little more notice--indeed I do!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see who\'s going to know, in that push, whether I\'ve had a bath\r\nor not," persisted the argumentative Tim.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t? Have you happened to get a glimpse of that ebony ring round\r\nyour neck?" interrogated his mother significantly. "Anybody who saw\r\nthat would have some notion."\r\n\r\n"I hate a bath!"\r\n\r\n"You look it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, shut up, Timmie," cautioned Carl in an undertone. "Don\'t go rowing\r\nat Ma now. If you do she may get her back up and not take you to the\r\nparty at all. I hate to be scrubbed within an inch of my life as much\r\nas you do, but I\'m not saying so to-day. I\'d be boiled in oil sooner\r\nthan not go to this party. Besides, your neck is black. I\'ll bet it\r\nwill take sapolio to get it clean. But don\'t go yammering about it.\r\nJust hop and do as Ma tells you. It\'s the only way."\r\n\r\nHeeding the wisdom of his elder brother Tim ceased further protests and\r\n_hopped_.\r\n\r\nIndeed the hopping became very spirited and general during the short\r\ninterval that preceded the wedding day. And when at last that glorious\r\nmorning dawned cloudless and fair, what a scarlet, shining, spotless\r\ncavalcade of McGregors its radiant light shone upon!\r\n\r\nFirst there was Mrs. McGregor, hot but triumphant in a petticoat that\r\ncrackled like brittle ice beneath her black alpaca skirt and a pair of\r\nwhite cotton gloves at the fingers of which she was continually\r\ntugging. Both her hat and Mary\'s gleamed ebon under a recent coat of\r\nblacking--so recent that they entertained some concern lest it trickle\r\ndown their heated faces in disfiguring rivulets. Mary\'s white dress\r\nrustled as crisply as did her mother\'s petticoat and her hair, crimped\r\nand ironed until it was fuzzy as a bushman\'s, drifted out behind her, a\r\nhempen whirlwind. New flowers on her hat and accompanying pink\r\nstreamers afforded her tranquil satisfaction as did also the string of\r\ncoral beads Uncle Frederick had once sent from Naples, a gift worn only\r\non very special occasions.\r\n\r\nAs for the boys, every hair of their heads had been plastered securely\r\ninto place, and blistered with scrubbing, they stood wretched but\r\nhopeful in a row waiting with patience the moment when clean shirts,\r\ncreased trousers, and sparkling boots might be forgotten in the\r\ndelights the Coulter party promised.\r\n\r\nEven Nell and the baby looked unnatural and reflected the general\r\ndiscomfort and self-consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe getting-ready had been a fatiguing ordeal and everybody\'s nerves\r\nwere at the breaking point. Systematically Mrs. McGregor had proceeded\r\nwith the process, beginning with the eldest of the family, and as each\r\nwork of art was completed it was set aside much as a frosted cake is\r\nset away to cool, and the next victim was summoned.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime those who had been _finished_, motionless in chairs,\r\nwere allowed the entertainment of watching each succeeding martyr put\r\nthrough his round of torture. Yet diverting as this had been, the\r\nwaiting had been tedious, particularly for those who stood at the head\r\nof the line.\r\n\r\nNow, the rite over, everybody drew a long breath and struggled to\r\nforget past miseries. Therefore when Hal and Louise Harling, who were\r\nto augment the procession, arrived, every cloud was put to flight and\r\nthe delegation set forth in the highest of spirits.\r\n\r\n"What a pity it is Uncle Frederick Dillingham isn\'t here!" commented\r\nMrs. McGregor, as they went along. "And what a shame, too, that\r\nGrandfather Harling and your mother, Louise, cannot see this day! It\r\nwould furnish them with something to talk of for weeks."\r\n\r\n"Hal and I will tell them all about it," returned the girl brightly.\r\n"Isn\'t it splendid you all could go? Poor Carl was so disappointed when\r\nhe thought he was to be out of it."\r\n\r\n"I know he was," nodded the lad\'s mother. "In fact, it worried me not a\r\nlittle lest it was because he made his disappointment so evident that\r\nwe got invited. I was afraid some well-meaning person might have taken\r\npity on him and begged him a card. Had not you and Hal declared you had\r\nnothing to do with our being asked, I should not have stirred a peg to\r\nthe party, let Carl plead as he might. But now I feel more comfortable\r\nabout our going, although I must confess it puzzles me why the\r\ninvitation was sent to him instead of to me. It certainly seems a\r\nlittle funny. However, it may have been an accident. Of course Mr.\r\nCoulter has had a lot to think of and might well be forgiven one\r\nmistake. It isn\'t likely he could remember my husband\'s name. He was\r\npretty good to think of us at all."\r\n\r\n"They say at the mills that Mr. John is very friendly and has ever so\r\nmany plans afoot for the workers. There is even talk of a recreation\r\nbuilding being put up on the factory grounds."\r\n\r\n"Not much like his father, who wouldn\'t spend a cent he didn\'t have\r\nto," mused Mrs. McGregor.\r\n\r\n"No. Mr. John is different; everybody says so. Besides, he is younger\r\nand belongs to a generation with other ideas."\r\n\r\n"Better ideas, I hope. If children didn\'t improve on their fathers\r\nwhere would the world be?" Then suddenly cutting short her\r\nphilosophical meditations Mrs. McGregor called imperatively:\r\n\r\n"Timmie, stop chasing those butterflies this minute. Do you want to\r\nspoil the shine on your shoes before you even get to the party? You\'ll\r\nhave your collar ruined if you gallop round and get so hot. Come back\r\nhere and walk beside me. I\'m resolved to land you all at Mr. Coulter\'s\r\nlooking like human beings, whatever happens afterward. Then if you\r\nprefer to smooch your face with dirt and rumple up your hair, I can\'t\r\nhelp it. But you shall stay clean until you\'re inside the gate."\r\n\r\nGlaring for a moment on her subjects with subduing ferocity Mrs.\r\nMcGregor drew herself up and moved majestically in at the entrance of\r\nthe Coulter mansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SOLUTION OF MANY MYSTERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce inside the magic portal of the great estate, however, Mrs.\r\nMcGregor\'s task became increasingly difficult. What a bewildering scene\r\nit was! The green lawns, terraced down to the lake, were dotted with\r\ntents and from each one floated out tantalizing hints of the delights\r\nwithin. The strains of a band and the laughter of dancers drifted\r\nforth from one; waiters with heavily laden trays passed in and out of\r\nanother; around still a third swarmed children and one glimpsed through\r\nthe open doorway a marionette show. Under a gay red umbrella at the\r\nedge of the garden women, fluttering like multi-hued butterflies,\r\nladled lemonade from giant punch-bowls.\r\n\r\nOh, a wonderland of myriad delights beckoned in every direction and it\r\nwas only by dint of extreme severity that Mrs. McGregor succeeded in\r\nkeeping her little army in formation and preventing its neatly ranged\r\nranks from becoming lost in the surrounding hubbub.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not to stir a step from this spot until I tell you you may,"\r\ncommanded she. "The very notion of your all racing off to enjoy\r\nyourselves before you have so much as said a word of thanks to Mr.\r\nCoulter who asked you here! Where are your manners? Are you forgetting\r\nso quick that it is his wedding day? Aren\'t you going to wish him joy\r\nas is proper to do when he has taken all this trouble to give you a\r\ngood time?"\r\n\r\nHer tone was withering in its rebuke and as if hypnotized by its\r\ncadence the wriggling children thronging in her wake stood motionless.\r\n\r\n"In my day folks were grateful for what was done for them and expected\r\nto say _thank you_ to their elders. Now there seems to be no such thing\r\nas politeness among youngsters. But to-day, whether you will or no,\r\nbefore you do anything else we are going to hunt up Mr. John and his\r\nbride and every one of you is to thank him for asking you to his party.\r\nAnd Tim, you and Mary and Carl are to repeat the speech I taught you. I\r\npray you\'ve not forgotten it already. You hope he and his wife will\r\nhave many days as happy as this one. Remember and don\'t get mixed up\r\nand say the wrong thing."\r\n\r\nWith this final caution Mrs. McGregor wheeled about and marshalled the\r\nminiature procession following her into a vast, rose-garlanded tent at\r\nthe right of the entrance. Two aisles roped off with laurel divided it,\r\nand throngs of people were moving down one of these and returning by\r\nthe other. In the far distance one could see a canopy of green, a\r\nfigure misty in white tulle, and a bevy of bridesmaids in pink, blue,\r\nyellow, and lavender.\r\n\r\n"This seems to be the right place," whispered Mrs. McGregor. "We\'ll\r\nfall right in behind this man and woman. Now mind your manners, all of\r\nyou. Poor though we are, we can be polite without it costing us a cent.\r\nTimmie, you keep close at my heels with Mary. I\'ve got all I can do to\r\nhandle the baby and Nell. Carl, see that you don\'t squeeze Martin\'s\r\nhand too tight and get him peevish. Take hold of him gently. And don\'t\r\none of you dare to push. We must expect to move along slowly and wait\r\nour turn. Yes, I know it\'s hot. But there\'ll be lemonade and ice cream\r\nby and by. I guess you can stand the heat for a little while. What is\r\nit, Tim? Your boots hurt? Nonsense! They\'re the same boots you always\r\nwear, aren\'t they? Were you racing round playing ball in them it\'s\r\nlittle notice you\'d be taking of them, I reckon. Don\'t be silly and get\r\nsulky now or next time I shall leave you at home."\r\n\r\nTo an accompaniment of these and similar admonitions the McGregor host\r\nproceeded on its way along with the other guests.\r\n\r\nThen at last when the receiving party was well in sight and Mrs.\r\nMcGregor and her family were making a decorous approach the anxious\r\nmother was horrified to see Carl, forgetful of all else, rush from the\r\nline and racing up to Mr. John Coulter, seize both his hands.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried the boy, in a voice so shrill with ecstasy that its accents\r\npenetrated to every corner of the great tent, "Oh, Mr. Coulter, I never\r\ndreamed it was you! Why didn\'t you tell me who you were? I\'m so glad to\r\nsee you again! I thought I never would. I\'ve hunted and hunted for you\r\nand your red car ever since."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I\'ve hunted for you and your red car ever since."\r\n_Page_ 253.]\r\n\r\nPlainly Mr. John Coulter, instead of being offended by this unexpected\r\nonslaught, was delighted for he beamed down on the excited lad, shook\r\nboth his hands heartily, and laughed so the ring of it echoed all\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n"So you didn\'t guess the riddle, little chap," Mrs. McGregor heard him\r\nsay. "Well, I didn\'t mean you should."\r\n\r\n"And to think it was you!" Carl was still murmuring, as if in a trance.\r\n"Just to think it was you! Of course you were the one who got Louise\r\nher new place."\r\n\r\n"Guilty."\r\n\r\n"Gee, but it was white of you! She\'s right here behind my mother." Then\r\ninspired by sudden understanding he added, "And the Christmas dinners\r\ncame from you, too."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, youngster, this is no moment to be confronting me with all\r\nmy crimes," the blushing bridegroom protested. "Here\'s Mrs. Coulter\r\njust married to me--what is she going to think if you tell her how many\r\nconspiracies I have been mixed up in? This, Marion, is one of my very\r\ngood friends, Carl McGregor. His father was for many years in our mills\r\nand if I mistake not here is his whole family coming up to speak to\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Indeed we are, sir," declared Mrs. McGregor, making a quaint English\r\ncurtsy, "and it\'s scandalized enough I am to see my boy here racing at\r\nyou as if he was a wild beast and forgetting all the etiquette I\'ve\r\ntaught him. He had a nice speech ready to say but where it is now\r\nheaven only knows!"\r\n\r\n"I\'d far rather he said to me what he did," asserted Mr. Coulter. "You\r\nsee, Carl and I are old friends."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see," replied the mystified mother, "but no doubt you are,\r\nsince you tell me so. I myself had no idea the lad know you from Adam."\r\n\r\n"And I hadn\'t either, Mother. Gee, but it is rich! To think I went\r\nriding with you that day, Mr. Coulter, and speeled off all that guff,\r\nand you never so much as raised an eyelash!"\r\n\r\n"Carl!" ejaculated his despairing parent.\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope this is not to be the end of our acquaintance,\r\nyoungster," Mr. Coulter returned, passing over Mrs. McGregor\'s rebuke.\r\n"Come and see Mrs. Coulter and me some day. And remember that if you\r\never wish to enter the mills I will make a place for you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s bully of you, sir!"\r\n\r\n"Carl!" Mrs. McGregor was dumb with consternation. "The very idea of\r\nyour speaking to Mr. Coulter like that!" declared she, when at last she\r\ncould catch her breath. "Come away before you say anything more to\r\ndisgrace the family. There\'s others waiting to give him their good\r\nwishes and you seem to have forgotten all about yours, although\r\ngoodness knows you were drilled and drilled on the speech you were to\r\nmake. Yes, Mrs. Coulter, these are my children--all six of them. The\r\nbaby\'s name? James Frederick, after his uncle. And this is Mary, and\r\nTimmie, and Martin, and Nell. The oldest ones had nice things ready to\r\nsay to you but Carl has knocked \'em clean out of their heads. I hope\r\nyou\'ll not lay it up against us. No, marm, this tall boy and girl don\'t\r\nbelong to me, but I\'m that fond of \'em I wish they did. They are our\r\nneighbors, Hal and Louise Harling."\r\n\r\nInstantly Mr. Coulter reached forward and greeted the young people.\r\n\r\n"The new job is going well?" he asked, addressing Louise.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m so happy in it, Mr. Coulter."\r\n\r\n"That\'s good! And you, Harling?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting on splendidly, sir."\r\n\r\n"Excellent! There\'ll be a raise coming to you next month--quite a\r\nsubstantial one. We\'ve been looking you up."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, how can I----"\r\n\r\n"There, there! We mustn\'t stop to talk about it now. If you must thank\r\nsomebody for it thank this young scoundrel here. It was he put me up to\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThere was time for nothing further. Swept onward by crowds that surged\r\nbehind, the McGregors, like chips on the crest of a mammoth wave, were\r\nborne forward and out of the tent.\r\n\r\nIn the open air Mrs. McGregor wiped her perspiring brow.\r\n\r\n"Now," began she, turning accusingly on her son, "perhaps you will be\r\nso good as to tell us what all this is about. How came you to know Mr.\r\nJohn Coulter well enough to be treating him like a long-lost brother?\r\nAnd what had you to do with Hal and Louise and the Coulter mills? I\r\nfeel as if I were going crazy! One minute you don\'t even know Mr.\r\nCoulter by sight and the next he is sending us a Christmas dinner and\r\nyou are fairly falling on his neck."\r\n\r\nCarl shook with laughter.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mother, it\'s all so rich--so perfectly corking!" he cried. "You\r\ncouldn\'t half appreciate it if I told you."\r\n\r\n"I could try," came curtly from Mrs. McGregor.\r\n\r\nBut her son did not heed her.\r\n\r\n"To think of that being Mr. John Coulter," chuckled he. "And, oh, the\r\nthings I said to him! I tremble to recall them. I told him Corcoran was\r\na low-down skunk, I know that. And I gushed on a lot about Hal and\r\nLouise. I only wish I could remember what I did say. Jove! He must have\r\nsplit his sides laughing."\r\n\r\n"When? When did you do all this?" interrogated the lad\'s mother\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n"Oh, when was it?" ruminated Carl, struggling to collect his scattered\r\nwits. "It seems ages and ages ago that all that happened. It was before\r\nChristmas, I\'m certain of that."\r\n\r\n"And you went riding with Mr. Coulter? I heard you saying something\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You actually went to ride with him?"\r\n\r\n"I sure did!"\r\n\r\n"Well, all I can say is I should like to know when all these miracles\r\ntook place," repeated Carl\'s mother. "Where was I, and why wasn\'t I\r\ntold? You might at least have mentioned it at home."\r\n\r\n"I know it, Ma," apologized Carl with disarming frankness. "I did try\r\ntwice to tell you but the chance never seemed to come right; and by and\r\nby it got to be so long ago that I forgot all about it."\r\n\r\n"Forgot you went motoring with Mr. John Coulter?" Mrs. McGregor spoke\r\nwith incredulity.\r\n\r\n"You see I didn\'t know at the time that it was Mr. John Coulter, Ma."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see! I don\'t understand anything about it," repeated the woman\r\nhelplessly.\r\n\r\n"Well, you will by and by. It is a long story--too long to tell now.\r\nWhen we get home you shall hear it from beginning to end. But now----\r\nGee whizz! There goes Martin making for the pond! I\'ll head him off."\r\n\r\nAway went Carl across the velvet lawn and with an unsatisfied air Mrs.\r\nMcGregor wheeled about to collect Nell and Tim, who were already\r\ntugging at her skirts. She felt as if the events of the past half-hour\r\nwere a dream. Carl, her harum-scarum son, the catastrophe worker of the\r\nfamily, was the acknowledged friend of Mr. John Coulter, one of the\r\nrichest and most revered citizens of Baileyville. And more than that he\r\nappeared to possess the influence to have men removed from their jobs\r\nand discharged employees reinstated in lost positions. He even had\r\npower to have people\'s salaries raised. Would wonders never cease?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nUNRAVELING THE SNARLS\r\n\r\n\r\nHow late the McGregors sat up talking that night it would have been\r\nalarming to confess. It was so late that the streets became silent and\r\ndeserted and conversation had to be conducted in whispers lest it\r\narouse the O\'Dowds, Sullivans, and Murphys.\r\n\r\nAnd what tense, eager whispers they were!\r\n\r\nMrs. McGregor, her bonnet still in her lap, sat on the edge of a chair\r\ntoo engrossed to so much as think of the shrimp pink tulle dress she\r\nhad planned to finish before she went to bed that night; nor did she,\r\nin her usual methodical manner, take time to slip out of her best skirt\r\nor put away her company shoes and gloves. She was far too excited for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHappy, tumbled, and nodding the babies had been put to sleep and\r\nafterward their elders, joined by Hal and Louise Harling, huddled in\r\nthe kitchen, closed the doors, and talked and talked. Every detail of\r\nCarl\'s amazing story had to be told over and over again that his\r\nlisteners might enjoy to the full the marvel and humor of each\r\nsuccessive event. Everything was clear as crystal now--Corcoran\'s\r\ntransfer, Louise\'s reinstatement, Hal\'s increasing salary, the\r\nChristmas dinners. Even the conundrum of the watch remained an enigma\r\nno longer.\r\n\r\n"It was, of course, Mr. Coulter who told Corcoran about your rescuing\r\nhis baby," Carl explained to his chum. "I remember that I happened to\r\nmention the accident to him."\r\n\r\nHal nodded.\r\n\r\n"But the thing I don\'t understand," he said with a puzzled air, "is how\r\nyou could go to that office looking for a job and never so much as\r\nsuspect who Mr. Coulter was. There must have been signs up with the\r\nfirm\'s name on them."\r\n\r\n"I suppose there were," Carl answered. "I don\'t know about that. You\r\nsee, I was too rattled and wrought up to notice much of anything.\r\nBesides, I was some scared. It was such a swell joint and that bell-boy\r\n(or whatever you call him) was so lofty and elegant that it froze the\r\nblood in my veins. More than that I was crazy to get a position and was\r\nso darned afraid they wouldn\'t take me that I wasn\'t thinking of\r\nanything else."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a bully little pal, Carl," Hal remarked, placing an\r\naffectionate hand on the younger boy\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Pooh! I did no more than you\'d have done for me if I\'d been in a\r\nhole," replied Carl modestly. "You\'d move heaven and earth to help us\r\nif we needed you."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve said it, youngster!"\r\n\r\n"Then what is there so remarkable in my trying to do the same for you\r\nand Louise?"\r\n\r\n"It was splendid of you, Carlie," whispered Louise.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I didn\'t do much," was the gruff retort. "As it happened, I didn\'t\r\nreally do anything. But I wanted to--you can bank on that."\r\n\r\n"Evidently you convinced Mr. Coulter of the sincerity of your good\r\nintentions," grinned Hal.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Coulter! Gee! Every time I think of him I have to laugh. Picture\r\nmy having the nerve to go reforming his mill for him and complaining of\r\nhis employees! And fancy me parading into his private office asking him\r\nfor work! Had I known what I was doing I should have been petrified\r\nwith fear." Smothered laughter convulsed the boys frame. "Well, as Ma\r\nsays, ignorance is bliss and fools rush in where angels fear to tread."\r\n\r\n"I guess Mr. Coulter sized up the situation all right," mused Hal.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he knew; he understood the whole thing. He told me so to-day,"\r\nCarl responded quickly. "He\'s live wire enough not to let a joke slip\r\npast him. He had his fun out of the affair and don\'t you think he\r\ndidn\'t. What\'s more, he didn\'t mean ever to let me find out what a boob\r\nI\'d been. He was just going to keep the secret to himself. Then this\r\nwedding party came along and he happened to think we might like to\r\ncome. So he took a chance and sent the bid."\r\n\r\n"And that explains why the invitation came to you," reflected Mrs.\r\nMcGregor.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, Ma. You have your little son Carlie to thank for your card\r\nto the spree," the lad responded impishly. "I\'ll be getting you into\r\nhigh society some day if you\'re good."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t get us all into jail or some other place before then\r\nwe\'ll be lucky," came brusquely from his mother.\r\n\r\n"Now isn\'t that gratitude for you?" growled Carl with mock indignation.\r\n"Here I take my mother and all her family to a perfectly good party and\r\nthis is all the thanks I get for it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, this happened to be a perfectly good party," agreed Mrs. McGregor\r\nmischievously. "But it might have ended in some scrape or other and\r\nlike as not it would another time. One never can be sure where your\r\nadventures will bring up."\r\n\r\n"Well, Ma, Mr. Coulter appreciates me if you don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Apparently he does--up to date. Just you take care that you go on\r\ndeserving his good opinion."\r\n\r\n"I mean to," Carl flashed. "Say, folks, sha\'n\'t we have something to\r\nwrite Uncle Frederick now? I\'ll bet it will take ten sheets of paper to\r\nretail the whole thing; and then he won\'t really have any idea of what\r\nhappened. None of you ever can. You just ought to have been there and\r\nseen the play."\r\n\r\n"It\'s as good as a play--as good as any moving picture, in my opinion,"\r\nLouise ventured.\r\n\r\n"What wouldn\'t I have given to be under the seat of that car and\r\nlistened when you were laying out poor old Cork!" Hal ejaculated.\r\n\r\n"I laid him fine and flat," acknowledged Carl with candor.\r\n\r\n"Events have proved you did. Poor Cork! Still, Corks float, you know,\r\nand he has. He isn\'t dead yet by any means," jested Hal. "In fact, he\r\ntold me only a day or two ago that he liked his new job much better\r\nthan he did the old one so I guess nobody need waste pity on him."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he wasn\'t punished much, after all," sniffed Mrs. McGregor.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s had it borne in upon him that he was a brute, Ma; don\'t you\r\nfret," declared Carl. "Mr. Coulter never does things by halves. When he\r\nstarts in he finishes up a job in bang-up style. Corcoran\'s learned his\r\nlesson; and if he has that is all that is necessary."\r\n\r\nA clock struck softly.\r\n\r\n"Hal Harling! Do you realize it is twelve o\'clock?" Louise exclaimed in\r\ndismay. "We must go home this minute. The very idea of our staying here\r\nand keeping the McGregors up until this hour! I\'d no idea it was so\r\nlate. Why, you may be robbed of your precious Corcoran watch if you\r\ndon\'t hurry home out of the lonely streets. Good-night, everybody! And\r\nblessings on you, Carlie! You\'ve been a trump. I\'m going to begin\r\nto-morrow and work harder than ever for Mr. John Coulter."\r\n\r\n"Here\'s to him!" Carl began. But a restraining hand was clapped over\r\nhis mouth.\r\n\r\n"Carl! Carl! For mercy\'s sake, remember that it\'s twelve o\'clock and\r\neverybody\'s abed and asleep. Don\'t go cheering for Mr. Coulter now. You\r\ncan go out in the field and do it to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'ll be too busy to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"And what\'ll you be doing to-morrow, pray, that\'s of so much\r\nimportance?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I\'ll have to be deciding whether I want to go to college, or go\r\nto sea with Uncle Frederick; or go into Mr. Coulter\'s mills," was the\r\nteasing answer. "I seem to have three careers open to me. Maybe I\'ll\r\nhave to toss up a penny to find out which I\'d better take. Will you\r\nlend me the penny, Ma?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I won\'t," snapped his mother wrathfully. "Three careers! Humph!\r\nStill I\'m not saying that if you could go into the mills with Mr.\r\nCoulter to stand behind you you might not make your fortune. But\r\nthere\'s time enough to decide that later. We needn\'t argue it at\r\ntwelve o\'clock at night."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CARL AND THE COTTON GIN***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 23560-8.txt or 23560-8.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/3/5/6/23560\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
